    "Measurement of the distance between two fluorophores (donor and acceptor) and changes thereof on an IDP can be achieved by smFRET. The strong distance dependence of smFRET can be used to distinguish distances in roughly the 30- to 70-Å range for typical single-molecule dyes. The output of a simple smFRET detection scheme is the FRET efficiency (EFRET) distribution, which is a measure of the distance between a donor and an acceptor molecule attached to an IDP of choice. Although the absolute distances are complex to obtain, it is possible to evaluate the changes in FRET efficiency in a ratiometric manner, for instance, upon folding of an IDP, binding of ligands, introduction of denaturants or crowders, and so on. Simultaneous collection of donor and acceptor bursts is essential for performing smFRET experiments. The data analysis includes the filtering of bursts originating from the same molecules and the calculation of FRET efficiency. In its simple form, FRET efficiency values can be approximated by a Gaussian distribution that will vary between 0 and 1, depending on the proximity of the donor and acceptor. After fitting the curve with a Gaussian function, an average FRET efficiency value for the population can be obtained, which can be further treated by solving an integral for an appropriate probability density function for distance distributions. Here, the protein α-synuclein and its labeling with specific dyes are used as an example, for clarity. However, general features of the protocol and variations thereof are provided at various points, so that the reader can adapt the procedure for their particular system.\nMaterials\nDropper with water or oil (for water- or oil-immersion objectives, respectively)\nObjective lens cleaning tissue (ThorLabs, cat. no. MC-5)\n∼10 nM stock solution of fluorescently labeled α-synuclein (or other protein; see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.80#cpch80-prot-0002]) in dilution buffer",
    "Protein dilution buffer, with appropriate photophysical protectors and reducing agents (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.80#cpch80-rec-0001]), prepared fresh before use\nUniformly coated reflective surface for alignment (e.g., a small mirror; a regular coverslip can also be used, though its lower reflectivity requires higher laser power)\nSingle-molecule detection setup (see Strategic Planning for additional details)\nTween 20–coated borosilicate chambered glass coverslips (Nunc™ Lab-Tek™ II Chamber Slide™, ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. no. 154534)\nSoftware for data analysis (e.g., OriginLab)\nBeam alignment in the detection part of the setup\nIMPORTANT NOTE: While APD detection is ongoing, the ambient light exposure should be minimized to avoid damage to the APDs. Also, carefully follow any instructions for the specific instrument and laser that you are using.\n1. Switch the laser power on and allow it to stabilize for at least 15 min. Switch the laser power meter on, and then monitor the laser power and fluctuations until the power has stabilized.\n2. Adjust the laser power to a desired value (100-150 µW should be sufficient) and remove the laser power meter from the beam path. If the light is not visible at the detection part of the setup, the intensity should be gradually increased.\n3. Place a drop of water or oil (as appropriate depending on the objective type) on the objective with a dropper.\n4. For alignment, place and align an appropriate surface (this can be the surface of a glass coverslip) at the sample plane to reflect excitation light back through the objective.\n5. Before carrying out steps 6-10, make sure the APDs are turned off.\n6. Adjust the pinhole to be as large as possible, or remove the pinhole from the detection path. This is useful for initial rough alignment of APDs.",
    "7. Remove spectral filters and dichroic mirrors (but not lenses or other beam-shaping optics) from the beam path in the detection box.\n8. With the help of a mirror, check whether the beam falls within the detector surface of the APD that detects light transmitted through the first dichroic mirror. This APD will be the least sensitive to any external alterations, as it does not require any reflection of light; hence, no mirror adjustments are needed. Change the APD position as needed until the beam is centered within the APD face.\n9. Replace the first dichroic mirror and check the beam that is reflected. With a white card or piece of paper, check that the beam falls in the middle of any reflective mirrors, then toward the APD face. Adjust the dichroic mirror as needed to reflect the beam to a point that is roughly in the middle of the APD detector opening.\n10. Adjust the second APD as in step 8. This operation can be extended to many APDs as needed; however, it is advisable to start from the least reflection-dependent APD and proceed accordingly. We typically use two APDs for simultaneous detection of donor and acceptor photons, though additional detectors can be used to monitor more colors or photon properties such as polarization.\n11. Place all the filters back in the beam path after the objective. This must be done before any of the following steps in which APDs are turned on.",
    "12. Insert a pinhole of the desired diameter in the light path. Replace the reflective surface with a sample chamber filled with free donor fluorophore (at low nanomolar concentration or below, and with low laser power). High fluorophore concentrations and powers could lead to APD saturation or damage. Therefore, start with as low a donor concentration as possible (5 nM is sufficient). Begin with lower laser power (20 μW), and then increase to the desired value (step 2) as needed, and decrease the frequency (i.e., increase the integration time) of data collection as necessary. A signal of ∼10-50 kHz is sufficient for alignment.\n13. Turn on the APDs and data acquisition program.\n14. Adjust the pinhole position until the signal from the APDs is maximized. For the two-APD detection system, at this point only one of them may respond, or both may respond but non-coincidentally (i.e., the signal may be diminished in one APD earlier than in the other one during pinhole alignment).\nIn fact, synchronicity of APDs as a response to adjustment is an excellent measure to assess to see whether APDs are aligned correctly or not. If needed, reduce laser power, go back to the large/no pinhole setup (step 6), and adjust the APD positions to maximize signal, then go back to step 12.\n15. Once the signal is maximized with the adjustment of the pinhole, individually adjust APDs further to maximize the signal.\n16. Repeat steps 14-15 iteratively, until no further improvements are recorded, and then turn off the ADPs and the data acquisition program.",
    "IMPORTANT NOTE: In a frequently used and stable single-molecule setup, the alignment should not deviate significantly. We routinely perform steps 14-16 for each new sample (though this requirement may be relaxed for stable setups, where this alignment should be checked for each new coverslip chamber). Performing steps 4-10 should be considered if the optical path is remodeled or a different donor-acceptor pair is being used.\nSingle-molecule FRET data acquisition\nNOTE: The data acquisition is described for measurements that utilize binned photons. Be sure to carefully follow any safety precautions needed for your specific system and experiment.\n17. Prepare the α-synuclein (or other protein) sample by diluting the sample with sterile-filtered protein dilution buffer and adding suitable photoprotectors (see Critical Parameters for additional information on photoprotectors). The final concentration of dual-labeled protein should be ∼100 pM. Add 200 µl of the solution to the coverslip chamber, and let it sit for 5 min before the measurement.\n18. Place the coverslip in the instrument and adjust the objective to focus the beam in the sample (about 30-50 µm from the surface).\n19. Turn on the APDs and data acquisition program.\n20. Adjust the acquisition frequency in the data acquisition program. The integration time is the reciprocal of this frequency; therefore, it should be tested according to the molecular motions expected within the sample. However, it is also important to remember that a higher frequency will yield a lower signal-to-noise ratio.\n21. If a real-time data visualization program is used, insert direct excitation, leakage, and signal threshold values. (See Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.80#cpch80-prot-0004] on how to determine these.)\n22. Run the experiment.\n23. Once the experiment (or set of experiments) is complete, turn off APDs and laser, remove the sample chamber, and wipe off the objective with objective cleaning wipes.",
    "Process binned photon counts and calculate FRET efficiency\n24. For ratiometric smFRET measurements, subtract the contributions of background from the raw donor and acceptor photon streams.\nAt low single-molecule concentrations, an estimate of background intensity can be obtained by averaging all photon counts within one channel over the course of the data acquisition time. Compare these to average counts for samples lacking fluorescent molecules as needed.\n25. Process background-corrected photon streams to obtain intensities corrected for leakage and direct excitation. Once these are determined, use the procedure in Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.80#cpch80-prot-0004] to obtain corrected donor and acceptor intensities.\n26. Apply a threshold (“T”) to the sum of donor and acceptor intensities within the same time bin (SUM = ID + IA > T) to identify qualifying bursts of donor and acceptor that originate from the same single molecule.\nIn addition to “SUM”, “AND” (ID >T AND IA > T) and “OR” (ID OR IA > T) criteria can be used, but those can be biased for specific EFRET values, and hence “SUM” is preferred (Deniz et al., 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.80#cpch80-bib-0014]). In the case of SUM, donor and acceptor bursts that sum to less than “T” are rejected.\n27. Calculate the FRET efficiency (EFRET) using Equation 1:\n         \nAlthough this simple procedure can be used for initial and many analyses, more advanced data analysis schemes can also be used to increase precision, as discussed in the Commentary below.",
    "A prerequisite for performing virtually any single-molecule fluorescence measurement is fluorophore labeling of the protein of interest. Although several labeling strategies exist that employ different chemical moieties, as explained in the Strategic Planning section, here we describe only fluorophore labeling of Cys residues via maleimide chemistry.\nMaterials\nFluorophores: maleimide-conjugated Alexa Fluor 488 (donor) and Alexa Fluor 594 (acceptor) (ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. nos. A10254 and A10256)\nOrganic solvent: dimethyl formamide (DMF) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)\n1 M Tris•Cl, pH 7.5\n5 N NaCl\nReducing agent: dithiothreitol (DTT) or tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP)\nLiquid nitrogen or dry ice and ethanol\nBuffer-exchange device: NAP column (GE Life Sciences, cat. no. 17085201) or HiTrap desalting column (GE Life Sciences, cat. no. 29048684)\nCentrifugal filter device (Millipore Sigma, cat. no. UFC500308) or dialysis device (ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. no. 88400)\nReagent preparation\nCAUTION: Fluorophores and fluorophore-labeled proteins should be kept in the dark, avoiding direct exposure to light as far as practical to minimize photobleaching.\n1. Dissolve 1 mg of each fluorophore in 200 µl of the organic solvent suggested by the manufacturer (e.g., DMSO) and measure the stock concentrations by UV-visible (UV-Vis) spectrometry. Prepare 10-µl aliquots and store up to 6 months at −80°C.\nAlternatively, the organic solvent can be evaporated using a vacuum centrifuge concentrator.\n2. Prepare labeling buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris•Cl and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5. Sterilize it by passing it through a 0.2-μm filter.",
    "See the manufacturer's instructions for buffer-reagent compatibility. High concentrations of chemical denaturants are generally suitable; however, for any buffer composition, the pH should lie between 6.5 and 7.5 for the maleimide coupling reaction. Additionally, thiols such as DTT should be excluded (although TCEP is fine), as they will react with the maleimide dye. For labeling with fluorophores that bear a net charge, it is advisable to include salt (100-300 mM NaCl) in the labeling buffer to screen nonspecific charge-charge interactions.\n3. Dissolve the α-synuclein (or other protein of interest) in the labeling buffer if lyophilized. Otherwise, buffer exchange it into the labeling buffer using gel filtration (NAP columns for prep scale or HiTrap desalting columns from GE) or a centrifugal filter device.\nThe labeling efficiency is higher at relatively high starting concentrations of protein, even if single-molecule fluorescence measurements require few molecules. Therefore, before performing the buffer exchange, concentrate the protein solution to at least 50 μM with a centrifugal filter device and verify the concentration by measuring the UV absorbance at 280 nm. (Any other non-interfering colorimetric assays, or measurement of absorbance at 205 nm, will also work.) Calculate the percentage labeling efficiency using Equation 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.80#cpch80-disp-0002]. Note that lower concentrations may be necessary to work with aggregation-prone proteins.\nSingle-fluorophore labeling\n4a. Add reducing agent and incubate the protein at room temperature for 1 hr to reduce any intra- and intermolecule disulfides. We suggest adding at least 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) or 0.5 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP).\nIf TCEP is preferred, make sure that the stock solution is pH adjusted.\n5a. If DTT is used, remove it from the solution by buffer exchange using devices outlined above. Any remaining DTT will react with maleimide fluorophores. If TCEP is used, it can remain in solution.",
    "6a. Add 3-10 mole equivalents of the fluorophore dropwise to the protein solution and ensure homogeneous mixing by gentle pipetting. Incubate 1 hr at 37°C, 2 hr at room temperature, or overnight at 4°C.\n7a. Remove the excess fluorophore by buffer exchange. If centrifugal filters are used, make sure the retentate is washed sufficiently so that no trace dye is detectable by UV absorbance of the flowthrough. Dialysis can be used for larger volumes.\nDouble-fluorophore labeling\nPerform these steps instead of the single-fluorophore labeling detailed above to obtain dual-labeled α-synuclein (or other protein) samples. Steps 4a and 5a of the single-fluorophore labeling procedure are essentially the same for double Cys-fluorophore labeling.\n4b. Add 1 mole equivalent (or substoichiometric amounts) of donor fluorophore dropwise to the protein solution. Ensure homogeneous mixing by gentle pipetting. Incubate for 1 hr at 37°C, 2 hr at room temperature, or overnight at 4°C.\nAlternatively, at this point 5 mole equivalents of the acceptor can also be added. If this “one-shot” approach is taken, purify the donor-acceptor pair from other permutations present in the sample by HPLC or high-resolution ion-exchange chromatography.\n5b. If only donor was added above, separate from free dye as in step 7a. It is advisable to reduce the protein again if step 4b is performed overnight, and the reducing agent (DTT) should be removed before the acceptor fluorophore is added.\nAlternatively, single-labeled protein can be separated from unlabeled protein at this step by HPLC or a high-resolution ion exchange chromatography.\n6b. After donor-only single-labeled protein is obtained, measure the concentration of the protein. Add a 5× molar excess of acceptor fluorophore and incubate 1 hr at 37°C, 2 hr at room temperature, or overnight at 4°C.\n7b. Perform step 7a again.\nVerify purity and identity of the labeled proteins",
    "8. Measure the labeling percentage by UV-Vis spectroscopy according to the formula\n         \nwhere Absλ,F is the absorbance value at the fluorophore's maximum absorbance wavelength; εF and εP are the fluorophore and protein extinction coefficients (in M−1 cm−1), respectively; CF is the ratio of fluorophore extinction coefficients at 280 nm and the maximum absorbance wavelength (provided by manufacturer, or can be measured using free dye); and l is the path length in centimeters. Labeling yields may be >90%, but vary depending on protein and label site.\n9. If needed, further purify the labeled proteins by HPLC or high-resolution ion-exchange chromatography.\nThis is especially useful if the labeling efficiency is low, which would be indicated by the measurement of a low yield in step 8 above for the donor-labeled protein, or by a large relative population of the “zero-peak” (i.e., donor-only molecules detected) in the smFRET histogram for the donor-acceptor-labeled protein.\n10. Verify the correct mass by LC-MS (or other MS method).\n11. Aliquot the labeled protein and snap-freeze it in liquid nitrogen or a dry ice/ethanol bath.\nA concentration of 50 µM is usually appropriate.",
    "Sample chambers for single-molecule fluorescence measurements exist in various forms. Chambered coverslip systems that are tailored for growing and imaging cells serve well for single-molecule measurements, as they come in multiwell formats. The ability to conduct measurements of different samples without changing the sample chamber on the microscope, the accessibility of well contents during the experiment, and the short preparation time make multiwell systems advantageous over sandwich-type glass-coverslip system.\nAvoiding nonspecific protein adsorption is crucial to performing single-molecule fluorescence experiments as limited number of molecules are available to freely diffuse in solution. Nonspecific adsorption is reduced by treating the chamber surfaces with detergent. Many sample chambers can be prepared at once and stored in dry conditions at room temperature for 1 month in a covered box wrapped in tissue paper to prevent dust from sticking to surfaces.\nMaterials\n10% (v/v) Tween 20 (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.80#cpch80-rec-0002])\nMilli-Q-filtered water\nBorosilicate chambered glass coverslip (Nunc™ Lab-Tek™ II Chamber Slide™ from ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. no. 154534) or other appropriate sample chamber(s)\nVacuum suction system\n1. Fill each surface or well with 10% Tween 20 and incubate it 30 min at room temperature.\n2. After incubation, discard the Tween 20 solution from the chamber, ideally using a vacuum suction system.\nAvoid Tween 20 contamination on the objective facing side of the glass surface.\n3. Wash the chamber thoroughly with Milli-Q-filtered water.\n4. Dry the chambers under light vacuum and store up to 1 month at room temperature.",
    "A strategy frequently used to prepare the chamber is to sandwich a spacer of double-sided tape or Parafilm between two coverslips or a glass slide and a coverslip. A detailed protocol for chamber preparation is documented by Joo and Ha for single-molecule fluorescence in TIRF mode (Joo & Ha, 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.80#cpch80-bib-0027]). A similar protocol can be used for detecting freely diffusing molecules, with the quartz slide replaced by borosilicate glass to reduce cost. Compared to the chamber slide system, the “sandwich” system requires a considerably lower volume of protein solution, with even 2-3 µl volumes sufficing in some cases.",
    "The measured signals depend on contributions from emission of donor and acceptor dyes in the donor and acceptor detection channels respectively, arising from (i) donor excitation, (ii) donor emission (arising from donor excitation) leakage into the acceptor channel (L), and (iii) direct excitation of acceptor by excitation (Dex). These terms are dependent on both the inherent photophysical properties of the donor and acceptor pair and characteristics of the instrument (including filters and dichroic mirrors). To determine the leakage contribution, use a proper donor-only labeled sample.\nMaterials\nDonor-only and acceptor-only labeled protein samples (Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.80#cpch80-prot-0002])\nTween 20–coated borosilicate chambered glass coverslip (Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.80#cpch80-prot-0003])\nSingle-molecule detection setup (see Strategic Planning)\n1. Place an appropriate concentration of donor-only labeled sample into the sample chamber. The concentration of the donor-only sample must be sufficiently high for a reliably measurable donor emission to leak into acceptor channel, but it should not be in the saturation or damage range for the donor channel.\nSee the suggestions of the APD manufacturer concerning the maximum count rate.\n2. Record the raw photon counts in both donor and acceptor channels (see Basic Protocol, steps 18-22). Perform only background correction by subtracting the average number of photons for both donor and acceptor channel, recorded for buffer-only sample. Raw photon numbers of donor (RD) and acceptor (RA) can be defined as follows (Brustad et al., 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.80#cpch80-bib-0008]):\n         \nWhen there is no acceptor fluorophore present, the RA term in Equation 3b[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.80#cpch80-disp-0004] will reduce to RA = L × ID (because there are no acceptor fluorophores, the Dex term in Equation 3b[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.80#cpch80-disp-0004] also becomes obsolete). L can be calculated by combining Equations 3a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.80#cpch80-disp-0003] and 3b[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.80#cpch80-disp-0004].",
    "In theory, Dex can even be estimated in an ensemble fluorometer by exciting acceptor-only sample with the excitation wavelength of laser. Dex can be determined in a single-molecule setup by using an equimolar mixture of donor and acceptor. The theoretical numbers found on manufacturer's website inferred from absorption spectra of donor and acceptor or determined by an ensemble fluorometer can deviate in a single-molecule setup as a function of relative detection efficiencies of detector.\n3. Place an equimolar mixture of donor and acceptor fluorophore in the sample chamber. Follow the concentration guidelines suggested for determining leakage contribution.\n4. Excite with a laser that is suitable for donor fluorophore excitation.\nMake sure all optical filters for the acceptor are in place.\n5. Assuming that there is no FRET between free dyes (which is true at low nanomolar concentrations, such as are used here), the IA term in Equation 3b[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.80#cpch80-disp-0004], which indicates the intensity of acceptor originating from sensitized emission, should be 0, whereas RA includes contributions from leakage of donor emission and direct excitation of acceptor with donor excitation. Hence RA/RD becomes (L + Dex)/(1 – L), which can be solved for Dex with a known L."
