    "Optional: available modular cloning (MoClo) modules for construct design A helpful protocol on how to design and clone constructs by using the Golden Gate cloning and the MoClo system can be found in Engler et al. (2014).If cloning is planned with this method, the provided level 0 PMA1 promoter and ADH2 terminator module can be used (Figure 1A).As level 1 acceptor vector, choose a yeast-compatible one. Here, the MoClo level 1 acceptor vector pAGT572 (uracil selection) was used (Figure 1B and 1C).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4733/bioprotoc-13-15-4733-g001.jpgFigure 1. Golden Gate cloning strategy with the provided modular cloning (MoClo) modules. A. We provide the level 0 MoClo modules for the PMA1 promoter (Pro+5U module) and the ADH2 terminator (3U+Ter module). The candidate transporter gene has to be amplified with CDS1 stop or without stop (CDS1 no stop) according to the MoClo guidelines. The latter can be used to fuse a C-terminal tag (CT). The required BsaI overhangs for cloning are indicated for each module. B. In this example, the yeast-compatible level 1 acceptor vector pAGT572 with uracil selection was used. Cloning of the level 0 modules into the level 1 acceptor vector is done in a cut-ligation with BsaI. C. The final level 1 transcription unit contains all parts required for yeast transformation and expression of the candidate transporter.Remember to clone suitable negative and positive controls for the drop-out assay. We usually use an empty plasmid or GFP on a plasmid as negative control and the yeast monosaccharide transporter Hxt1 (NCBI 856494) as positive control. The transcription unit (pJS288) for the positive control used in this protocol (Hxt1 under control of the PMA1 promoter and ADH2 terminator cloned in pAGT572) is available via Addgene #200714.For more background information, see General Note 3.Preparation of competent EBY.",
    "VW4000 cells A helpful protocol on how to prepare competent yeast cells can be found in Gietz and Schiestl (2007a).For EBY.VW4000, use the following modifications of this protocol:Streak out a stock of EBY.VW4000 cells on a plate with solid YPM medium (Recipe 1) (single colony needed). Incubate at 28 °C for two days.Pick a single yeast colony and inoculate a 50 mL preculture by using liquid YPM medium. Incubate the culture overnight at 28 °C on a shaker at 140 rpm.Take a 1 mL sample and dilute 1:10 with liquid YPM. Mix the sample before diluting and before measuring. Measure the OD600 of the 1:10 dilution.Calculate the volume of preculture needed to inoculate a 200 mL main culture with an OD600 of 0.1 in YPM medium. Do not forget to include the dilution factor in your calculation.Incubate the yeast cells at 28 °C on a shaker at 140 rpm until an OD600 between 0.6 and 0.8 is reached.Note: Regularly check the OD600. Do not overgrow the culture. In our hands, it took approximately 5 h to reach an OD600 between 0.6 and 0.8. Perform the next steps at RT.Split the culture equally into six 50 mL reaction tubes (approximately 33.33 mL for each tube).Note: For centrifugation, we never fill the tubes with the maximum possible volume. We usually centrifuge a maximum of 2/3 of the total tube volume. This prevents spilling during centrifugation, as tubes are not tightly closed. Centrifuge at 3,000× g for 5 min.Discard the supernatant.Add 16.6 mL (0.5 V of the starting culture, divided by six tubes: 0.5 × 200 mL/6) of sterile ddH2O to each tube and resuspend the pellet.Combine two resuspended pellets in one tube. This results in three tubes with approximately 33.2 mL each.Centrifuge at 3,000× g for 5 min.Discard the supernatant.",
    "Resuspend the three pellets by adding 0.666 mL (0.01 V of the starting culture, divided by three tubes: 0.01 × 200 mL/3) of sterile ddH2O to each tube. Combine the resuspended pellets of all three tubes into one tube (total volume approximately 1.99 mL).Centrifuge at 3,000× g for 5 min.Discard the supernatant.Resuspend the pellet by adding 2 mL (0.01 V of the starting volume: 0.01 × 200 mL) of FCC solution (Recipe 2) to each tube.Prepare aliquots of 50 μL competent cells in 1.5 mL tubes for subsequent transformation.Store at -20 °C for at least 3 h (overnight is also possible).Note: Slowly freezing the cells is essential for survival. Store at -80 °C for long-term storage.Optional: To check the general viability of the competent cells, plate a 1:100 dilution (in ddH2O) of one aliquot on YPM medium and incubate overnight at 28 °C. The plate should be nicely overgrown with yeast.Yeast EBY.VW4000 transformation This method is based on the protocol for LiAc/SS carrier DNA/PEG transformation by Gietz and Schiestl (2007b), with the following modifications:Thaw competent EBY.VW4000 cells on ice (50 μL per transformation).For each plasmid, one transformation mix is prepared:Mix the plasmid with ddH2O for a total volume of 14 μL and 600 ng plasmid in a 1.5 mL reaction tube. Vortex. Prepare one negative control with 14 μL of ddH2O only.Add 260 μL of 50% PEG3350 (Recipe 5), 36 μL of 1 M LiAc (Recipe 6), and 50 μL of salmon sperm carrier DNA (2 mg/mL) (Recipe 7).Mix well.Note: PEG3350 is very viscous. Pipette slowly and ensure that the transformation mix is well mixed. Store transformation mix at RT until use.Centrifuge competent yeast cells at 13,000× g for 2 min at RT.Discard the supernatant.Add the transformation mix, including the plasmid.",
    "Vortex or mix by pipetting up and down until the pellet is resuspended.Incubate for 60 min at 42 °C (water bath or heat block)Note: If not in stock, pour YNB plates with selective amino acid mix during the incubation time (Recipe 3 and Recipe 4). Centrifuge at 13,000× g for 30 s.Discard the supernatant.Add 1 mL of sterile ddH2O.Resuspend the pellet by pipetting up and down.Plate 50–200 μL on YNB medium (with selective amino acid mix, in our setup -Ura, and maltose).Note: We usually prepare two plates: one with 50 μL and a backup with 200 μL of transformed cells. The plasmids we are using contain a 2 μ origin of replication and typically yield between 50 and 100 clones when we plate 50 μL. The transformed cells can be stored at 4 °C and plated again one day later if needed. Incubate the cells for 2–3 days at 28 °C.Transfer 2–4 single colonies per transformation to a new YNB selection plate and grow overnight at 28 °C.To generate long-term stocks: scrape off one of the clones, resuspend in sterile 14% glycerol solution, and store at -80 °C. Usually, we prepare stocks of 2–3 individual clones.Yeast sugar uptake analysis via drop-out assay Prepare YNB plates with selective amino acid mix and the required carbon source in squared Petri dishes for the drop-out assay. Squared Petri dishes offer more space to analyze several strains and dilutions on one plate. In our experiment, we used YNB -Ura + maltose and YNB -Ura + glucose.Note: For yeast sugar uptake analysis, we usually include a negative control strain with an empty plasmid or GFP on a plasmid. As positive control, we use the yeast monosaccharide transporter Hxt1. We usually analyze at least two independent clones of the transporter of interest.",
    "Plate two clones per strain (fresh transformed or from stock) onto fresh YNB selective medium with maltose two days prior to the drop-out assay.The following steps are prepared at RT with sterile conditions, for example by working in a biosafety cabinet or next to a flame. Performing the assay under sterile conditions is recommended to avoid contamination of the yeast strains or plates.Prepare a 1.5 mL reaction tube with 1 mL of ddH2O for each clone.Scrape the colonies from the plates and resuspend in the tubes.Prepare a 1:10 dilution with ddH2O and measure the OD600.Calculate the volume needed for 1.5 mL of cell suspension with an OD600 of 0.4. Do not forget to include the dilution factor.Prepare 1.5 mL of cell suspension with an OD600 of 0.4 in a new 2 mL reaction tube. Vortex.Take 1 mL to check the OD600. Adjust again if needed.Prepare a serial dilution (500 μL volume) for each transformant in a new sterile 1.5 mL tube.Always vortex the solutions before preparing the next dilution.Label the squared plates for the drop-out assay. We usually use grid lines to generate nicely distributed drops (Table 1 and Figure 2A).Table 1. Example layout for drop-out grid lines table:",

    "Figure 2A shows an example of a possible labeling of the plates; the individual yeast transformants are ordered vertically and the corresponding serial dilution horizontally. At least two types of plates are required for the assay: one with YNB -Ura + maltose and one with YNB -Ura + glucose.Organize your tubes in a rack according to the droplet scheme on the plates (e.g., yeast transformants vertically, serial dilutions horizontally).Always vortex each tube immediately before pipetting.We prefer using a multichannel pipette for the drops as it is faster. This might require a little bit of training to place the drops correctly. You can also use a normal single-channel pipette.Note: The serial dilution and the spotting of the droplets can also be performed using a sterile 96-well plate and a microplate replicator (e.g., Millipore Sigma, Replica plater for 96-well plate, R2508 or similar). Drop 3 μL of each sample on the two plates. Always ensure that the pipette tips in the multichannel pipette are loaded equally. Avoid pricking the tips into the agar (Figure 2B). After pipetting, the drops should be visible on the plate (Figure 2C).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4733/bioprotoc-13-15-4733-g002.jpgFigure 2. Preparation and procedure of the yeast drop-out assay. A. Material needed. Prepare a vortex, pipette, and pipette tips. Prepare the plates needed with a pipetting scheme. In this case, a grid line was used, with the yeast strains ordered vertically and serial dilutions horizontally. Prepare a rack with the tubes ordered in the same scheme as the plate. B. A multichannel pipette is used to place the drops on the plate. C. Liquid drops visible on the plate after pipetting.Dry the plates (opened lid) under sterile conditions until no liquid drops are visible.Incubate the plates for 48 h at 28 °C. If the colonies are not clearly visible, the incubation time can be prolonged.",
    "Document the growth of the colonies by using a normal mobile phone camera or any other device. We typically take pictures with the Bio-Rad Chemidoc using the colorimetric mode (Figure 3)."
