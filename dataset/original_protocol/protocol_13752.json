  "procedures": [
    "1. Standard and conditioned medium preparation\nTo prepare standard RPMI 1640, supplement RPMI 1640 culture medium with 10% (v/v) of fetal bovine serum (FBS, previously heat inactivated) and 1% (v/v) of Penicillin-Streptomycin solution. Store the medium at 4 °C.Sterilize by using 0.22 µm filters.\nTo prepare palmitate stock solution, prepare a 50 mM solution of palmitate in the standard RPMI 1640 previously supplemented with 1% of bovine serum albumin (lipid free). A volume of 5-10 mL of this stock will be sufficient. Sterilize the stock solution by using 0.22 µm filters. Store at 4 °C protected from light for up to 1 month.\nTo prepare oleate stock solution, prepare a 50 mM solution of oleate in the standard RPMI 1640 previously supplemented with 1% of bovine serum albumin (lipid free). A volume of 10 mL will be sufficient. Sterilize the stock solution by using 0.22 µm filters. Store at -20 °C protected from light for up to 1 month.\nTo prepare steatogenic medium from the previously prepared stocks, prepare a 1-part palmitate: 2-part oleate steatogenic medium at two possible levels: mild and severe steatosis.\n\t\nMild Steatosis: Prepare 100 mL of a 1-part palmitate: 2-part oleate (50 µM) mix in standard RPMI 1640. Sterilize by using 0.22 µm filters. Store at 4 °C for up to 1 week.\nSevere Steatosis: Prepare 100 mL of a 1-part palmitate: 2-part oleate (500 µM) mix in standard RPMI 1640. Sterilize by using 0.22 µm filters. Store at 4 °C for up to 1 week.\nAlternative preparation for the stock solutions.\n\t\t\nPrepare both stock solutions using the respective fatty acids by using free lipid albumin as indicated above.\nWhen lacking free lipid albumin, use palmitate and oleate salts.",
    "Dissolve either palmitate or oleate in 2 mL of absolute ethanol and then mix in the final volume of standard RPMI 1640 (5-10 mL). Dissolve oleate directly by stirring in standard RPMI 1640 culture medium.\nAllow evaporation of ethanol by incubating in a water bath at 70 °C; mix thoroughly.\nIn every case, sterilize both stock solutions using 0.22 µm filters. Store palmitate stock solution at 4 °C and oleate stock solution at - 20 °C. Protect both solutions from light. These solutions are stable for 1 month.\n2. Pre-culture\nSeed 100,000 HepG2 cells per well in a 24-well plate. Add 1 mL of standard RPMI 1640.\nPre-incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h, allowing cell attachment.\n3. Steatogenic culture\nAfter pre-culture, discard the standard RPMI 1640 medium and add the steatogenic medium accordingly.\nDiscard the supernatant and add fresh steatogenic medium every 24 h.\n4. Viability and mortality assessment\nSeed 100,000 HepG2 cells per well in a 24-well plate. Add 1 mL of standard RPMI 1640.\nPre-incubate for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nChange standard RPMI 1640 medium for the steatogenic medium.\nIncubate for 24 h, 2 days, 3 days, and 4 days refreshing the steatogenic medium every 24 h.\nAfter the appropriate time, discard the supernatant.\nDetach cells from the well by adding 500 µL of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA. Incubate for 5 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nCollect the resuspended cells in a microtube.\nCentrifuge at 300 x g and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 200 µL of standard RPMI 1640 and resuspend the cells.\nAdd 15 µL of 0.4% Trypan blue solution in a fresh microtube. Mix with 15 µL of the previous cell suspension.\nCount the stained and non-stained cells in a hemocytometer.\nCalculate the viability and mortality rates accordingly.",

Lipid staining with Oil-Red O\nPut a cell culture coverslip in every well in a 24-well plate.\nSeed 100,000 HepG2 cells per well. Add 1 mL of standard RPMI 1640.\nPre-incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nChange standard RPMI 1640 medium for the steatogenic medium.\nIncubate for 24 h, 2 days, 3 days, and 4 days, refreshing the steatogenic medium every 24 h.\nAfter the appropriate time, discard the supernatant.\nWash with 1 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Discard the supernatant.\nFix with 1 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS.\nIncubate for 1 h at room temperature.\nDiscard the excess of paraformaldehyde.\nRinse the cells with 1 mL of distilled water.\nAdd 1 mL of 70% isopropanol and incubate for 5 min.\nDiscard the excess of isopropanol. A PBS wash is not needed at this point.\nAdd 1 mL of Oil-red O solution and incubate for 30 min.\nDiscard the excess of the Oil-red O solution.\nRinse with 1 mL of distilled water.\nAdd 500 µL of hematoxylin solution. Incubate for 3 min.\nDiscard the excess of hematoxylin solution.\nRinse with 1 mL of distilled water.\nObserve under the microscope at a magnification of 400x (Objective 40x, Ocular 10x).\n6. Morphometric assessment of lipid contents\nRandomly select and capture photographs of 10 optical fields from the complete area of the well. Repeat for every well.\nAssess the percentage of red stained area using the Color Threshold tool in the ImageJ software according to Ferreira and Rasband33.\nCompare the stained area with the complete area of the optical field using the Analyze Particles tool in the ImageJ software according to Ferreira and Rasband33.\nCalculate the average percentage of every well.\nSubscription Required.
