    "Production of receptor binding domains Vector constructionFor 10 μL of in-fusion reaction, mix 20 ng (1–3 μL) of synthetic gene, 100 ng (1–2 μL) of PmeI/NcoI cut pOPINTTG vector, 1 μL of Exnase II, and 2 μL of optimized buffer supplied with the cloning kit.Incubate the reaction at 37°C for 30 min, and then stop immediately, by adding 20 μL of ice-cold TE buffer.Use 5 μL of the resulting reaction mixture to transform 20 μL of Stellar competent cells, by incubating on ice for 30 min, then heat shocking at 42°C for 45 s.Add 400 μL of SOC media and incubate at 37°C for 45 min.Plate 100 μL of the cell and media mixture on LB-agar plates supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin, and culture at 37°C overnight.Pick single colonies into 3 mL of LB containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin and incubate at 37°C overnight.Produce glycerol stocks, by adding 0.5 mL of 50% (v/v) sterile glycerol to 0.5 mL of overnight culture of cells in LB in a 2-mL cryovial, and freezing at -80°C.Prepare DNA from pelleted cells, and confirm correct clones by sequencing minipreps DNAs with pTTfwd and PTTrev primers.Use 50% glycerol stock to grow larger scale cultures for transfection-grade plasmid preparation.Purify transfection-grade plasmids (0.5–1 mg) from 150 mL of overnight LB culture, using QIAGEN Plasmid Plus Midi kit and, if required, store plasmids at -20°C in sterile 1.5-mL Eppendorf tubes.Measure the purity and concentration of DNA using NanoDrop spectrophotometer. Plasmid DNA used for transfections should be of high purity (see Note 1).",
    "The concentration and purity of DNA is calculated automatically by the instrument using the following equations:Concentration: DNA (µg/mL) = (A260 reading – A320 reading) × dilution factor × 50 µg/mLPurity: (A260/A280) = (A260 reading – A320 reading) ÷ (A280 reading – A320 reading)Use 1 μg DNA per one million of transfected cells.Transfection protocolMaintain the suspension culture of Expi293TM cells for at least three passages after defrosting (passage numbers 3–30 can be used in experiments) in a humidified (80%) incubator, with 5–8% CO2, at 37°C, on an orbital shaker at 120 rpm in Gibco Expi293TM Express medium, at a cell density between 0.5 and 5.0 × 106 cells/mL. Use a 125-mL flask to maintain 30 mL of Expi293 cells.One day before transfection, seed Expi293TM cells at a cell density of 1 × 106 cells/mL. For each preparation of RBD, set up three cultures of 170 mL in 500-mL flasks.On the day of transfection, determine cell count and viability, and if cell count is between 2 × 106 –2.5 × 106/mL and at least 95% viable, proceed with transfection (see Note 2).For each 170-mL culture, mix 17 mL of OPTI-MEM media with 170 μg plasmid DNA and 918 μL of PEI Max 40kDa transfection reagent in a 50-mL Falcon tube.Mix thoroughly, incubate at room temperature (RT) for 10 min, and add gently (dropwise) to the Expi293TM cells (see Note 3).Add kifunensine from a stock concentration of 1 mg/mL (100 μL per 100 mL of culture volume), and return cells to incubate on the orbital shaker at 125 rpm, 5–8% CO2, 80% humidity and 37°C.After 16–18 h, add to each 170 mL culture, 2,890 μL of valproic acid, 1,100 μL of sodium propionate, and 3,400 μL of glucose. Return the culture to the incubator (see Note 4).",
    "On day 5 after transfection, determine cell count and viability.Harvest media, and spin in a 0.5-L centrifuge bottle at 6,000 × g for 20 min. Filter sterilise using a 0.45 μm 0.5-L bottle top filter.PurificationThe IMAC-SEC purification protocol is for an ÄKTA Xpress platform using a programme described inNettleship et al. (2009). The same workflow can be implemented on other purification systems with automated peak detection. A transcript of the Unicorn programme is provided as an Appendix[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20220406/Appendix.docx].Equilibrate the gel filtration column using the “Gel Filtration Equilibration” programme and the Gel filtration buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl).Follow the method “Mammalian Prepping System” to set up the system. It will pump wash A1 and A2, and clean the inlets. It will then ask you to screw the 5-mL column into position 1, and will equilibrate the column.Add an equal volume of PBS to the filtered cell supernatant, and adjust the pH to 7.4 with NaOH.Once the column is plugged in and the sample is ready to be loaded, slowly remove the A2 line from the buffer (by small movements to avoid bubbles in the line), and insert it into the sample. Make sure all the lines are at the bottom of the bottles.Leave the protocol to run overnight.Using the trace from the ÄKTA, select the correct fractions containing the protein of interest. Mix 10 μL of protein solution with 10 μL of sample buffer, and heat at 95°C for 5 min. Run an SDS-PAGE gel of the samples, and stain it using Instant Blue®.Concentrate the protein, usually to 5 mg/mL, using a 10 kDa concentrator centrifuge at 2,500 × g and 4°C.Aliquot (e.g., 0.1 mL) and flash freeze the protein, by plunging tubes into liquid nitrogen.Store at -80°C.",

Set up the culture: 800 mL of TB medium in a 2-L flask supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin, 0.1% glucose, and 1 mM MgCl2. Pre-warm the flask/medium to 37°C.Add pre-culture and grow culture on an orbital shaker at 225 rpm and 37°C.Add IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM when OD600 reaches ~1.2 (usually takes around 3.5 h), and continue growing at 225 rpm and 28°C overnight.Pellet the cells at 2,500 × g at 4°C for 15 min.Purification of VHHsAdd 15 mL of TES buffer to the cell pellet, and resuspend slowly in a bottle with a magnetic stirrer at 4°C overnight.The next day, add twice the volume of cold TES/4 buffer supplemented with 120U Kunitz DNaseI to the resuspended culture, and slowly stir for 2 h.Top up to 80-mL with TES/4 buffer.Spin down the pellet at 28,000 × g and 4°C for 30 min (in a 50-mL tube).",
