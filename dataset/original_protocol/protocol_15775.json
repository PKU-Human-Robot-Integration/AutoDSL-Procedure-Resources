    "NOTE: See the Table of Materials and the Supplemental Table S1 for recipes of all media and solutions used in this protocol.\n1. Differentiation of human iPSCs into NCSs, dopaminergic (DA) neurons, and astrocytes\nPrepare matrix-coated plates.\n\t\nThaw a vial of 5 mL of matrix on ice overnight. Dilute 1 mL of matrix with 99 mL of cold Advanced Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium/Ham's F-12 (Advanced DMEM/F12) (1% final concentration). Make 1 mL aliquots and store them at -20 °C.\nThaw the matrix solution at 4 °C (keep it cold) and coat 6 wells (1 mL per well in a 6-well plate).\nPlace the matrix-coated plate in a humidified 5% CO2/95% air incubator at 37 °C for 1 h. Take the plate out of the incubator and let it equilibrate to room temperature (RT).\n\t\t​NOTE: It is recommended to use the plate within 3 days of coating. However, the coated plate can be stored for up to 2 weeks at 4 °C. Just remember to take it out and let it warm up to RT before use. For longtime storage, add 1 mL of iPSC culture medium to the coated plate to avoid drying of the matrix.\nThawing iPSCs\n\t\nPrewarm the matrix-coated plates at RT or in the incubator at 37 °C for 20-30 min. Prewarm the required amount of iPSC culture medium at RT.\nMix 6 mL of prewarmed iPSC culture medium with 12 µL of Y-27632 ROCK inhibitor to obtain a final concentration of 10 µM.\nPartially thaw the frozen vial of iPSCs at 37 °C in a water bath until a small piece of ice remains.",
    "Slowly add 1 mL of prewarmed iPSC culture medium with 12 µL of ROCK inhibitor dropwise to the cells. Transfer the liquid content of the vial with iPSCs dropwise into one well of a 6-well precoated plate using a 5 mL pipette.\nMove the plate in perpendicular directions to mix the well contents and return the plate to the incubator. Change the iPSC culture medium after 24 h after washing with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) (1x) (Ca2+/Mg2+-free) (4 mL per well in a 6-well plate).\n\t\tNOTE: Do not add ROCK inhibitor to subsequent feedings. Change the iPSC culture medium daily.\nSubculturing of iPSCs\n\t\nPrewarm the matrix-coated plates at RT or in the incubator at 37 °C for 20-30 min. Prewarm the required amount of iPSC culture medium at RT.\nAspirate the culture medium from the plates containing the cells. Rinse the iPSCs with DPBS (1x) (Ca2+/Mg2+-free) (4 mL per well in a 6-well plate).\nAdd EDTA (0.5 mM) (1 mL per well in a 6-well plate). Incubate the plates at 37 °C until the edges of the colonies start to lift from the well (usually 3-5 min). Aspirate the EDTA.\nAdd prewarmed iPSC culture medium (4 mL per well in a 6-well plate) and forcefully detach the iPSC colonies using a 10 mL sterile pipette once. Do not pipette up and down as this may break cell clumps into single cells.\nTransfer the contents of each well into two individual wells in a matrix-coated 6-well plate (2 mL per well in a 6-well plate) and incubate at 37 °C. Do not generate bubbles in the suspension while pipetting.\n\t\tNOTE: Shake the plate gently before keeping it in the incubator. The split ratio can be 1:2 (one well into 2 new wells) to 1:4 (one well into 4 new wells).",
    "Replace the medium daily until the colonies reach 60% confluence with good size and connections.\nNeural induction and neural progenitor generation\n\t\nPrepare 500 mL of Chemically Defined Medium (CDM), 500 mL of Neural Induction Medium (NIM), and 500 mL of Neural Stem Cell Serum-free (NSC SF) medium.\nRinse the cells with DPBS (1x) (Ca2+/Mg2+-free) (4 mL per well in a 6-well plate) and add NIM (3 mL per well in a 6-well plate).

Add collagenase IV (1 mL per well in a 6-well plate) and keep in an incubator for 1 min. Aspirate the collagenase IV and wash once with DPBS (1x) (4 mL per well in a 6-well plate) gently.\nAdd 2 mL of NSC SF Medium per well to a 6-well plate. Detach the cells by scraping the bottoms of the wells by drawing grids using a 200 µL pipette tip.\nCollect the cell suspension from the 6-well plate into a 10 cm non-adherent dish. Make up the volume to 12 mL with NSC SF Medium.\nShake the non-adherent dish at 65-85 rpm on an orbital shaker in an incubator to prevent aggregation.\nDA neuron differentiation\n\t\nOn Day 7, add 12 mL of CDM supplemented with 100 ng/mL fibroblast growth factor-8b (FGF-8b) and place the dish on the orbital shaker in the incubator.\nOn Days 8-13, change the medium every 2 days and observe under the microscopy daily.",

Aspirate the laminin and wash the wells briefly with DPBS (1x) (4 mL per well in a 6-well plate) once before plating.\nCollect all spheres (from step 1.5.5) in 50 mL tubes and top up with DPBS (1x). Spin at 300 × g for 5 min. Aspirate the supernatant.\nIncubate with 2 mL of cell dissociation reagent (see the Table of Materials) for 10 min at 37 °C in a water bath followed by gentle trituration with a 200 µL pipette (20-50 times depending on the size of the spheres, avoiding bubble formation).\nNeutralize the cell dissociation reagent with 2 mL of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and centrifuge the 50 mL conical tube containing the cells at 300 × g for 5 min at RT. Aspirate the supernatant.",
    "Add 1 mL of CDM supplemented with 10 ng/mL Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and 10 ng/mL Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) to resuspend the cell pellets by gently pipetting up and down to obtain single-cell suspensions.\nAspirate the laminin solution from the plate (step 1.6.1.3), wash briefly with DPBS (1x) (4 mL per well in a 6-well plate), and seed the cells (from step 1.6.5) in the precoated plates or coverslips in 3 mL of CDM supplemented with 10 ng/mL BDNF and 10 ng/mL GDNF. Feed the cells every 4 days.\n\t\tNOTE: Differentiating cultures can be maintained for many weeks up to 3 months. The neural morphology usually appears after 2 weeks of termination and can be used for downstream analyses from that point onwards. BDNF and GDNF are not necessary for culturing for longer maintenance (up to 2 months).\nNSC generation\n\t\nCoat matrix plates.\nCollect all neural spheres (generated from step 1.4) in 50 mL tubes and top up with DPBS (1x) (Ca2+/Mg2+-free). Spin at 300 × g for 5 min. Aspirate the supernatants.\nIncubate the pellets with 2 mL of cell dissociation reagent for 10 min at 37 °C in a water bath, followed by gentle trituration with a 200 µL pipette (20-50 times depending on the size of the spheres, avoiding bubble formation).\nNeutralize with 2 mL of DMEM with 10% FBS and centrifuge the 50 mL conical tubes containing the cells at 300 × g for 5 min at RT.

When splitting the cells, PDL-coated coverslips are not necessary for culturing.\n2. Cell characterization by immunocytochemistry and immunofluorescence staining\nAt the end of the culture period, transfer the coverslips with the cells to a 12-well plate.\n\tRinse the cells with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (1x) two times and incubate for 10 min in 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) (0.5 mL per well in a 12-well plate) at RT.",
    "NOTE: The fixed sample can be covered with 2 mL of PBS (1x) and stored at 4 °C until required for immunostaining. PFA is toxic and is suspected of causing cancer.

    "Use the non-stained control tube to set the forward scatter area (FSC-A) and side scatter area (SSC-A) scatter plots based on the size and complexity of the cell population analyzed. See Supplemental Figure S2 for the microscope settings and parameters.\n\tNOTE: Set up non-stained controls for individual cell types.\nUse the non-stain control tubes to select the positive gates, and use single-color control tubes to compensate for the fluorescence spectral overlap between MTG (fluorophore-1 [FL-1]) and TMRE (FL-2) in multicolor flow cytometry. Use isotype control for negative control to monitor background staining in MRC and TFAM samples. Use the FCCP tube as a depolarization control for TMRE staining.\nGate out extraneous debris to select live cells and the main gating from the forward and side scatter plot (Figure 2A). Gate out doublets using a forward scatter height (FSC-H) versus (vs.) FSC-A density plot to exclude doublets and also construct a side scatter height (SSC-H) vs. SSC-A plot (Figure 2A).\nData acquisition (flow cytometer)\n\t\nUsing the unstained or isotype samples as a negative control, create a gate above the main population of the single-cell events while viewing SSC-A and the various filters (FL1, FL2, FL3, FL4) (Figure 1B and Figure 2B).\nData analysis (CFlow software)\n\t\nCopy the position of the gates onto the stained cell samples, and record the amount of positively stained cells for the positive staining.\nFor each cell subpopulation, select a histogram plot and analyze the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the different filter channels (FL1, FL2, FL3, FL4) (x-axis).\n\t\t\nCalculate the TMRE levels by subtracting the MFI of FL2 of #2 FCCP-treated cells from the MFI of FL2 from #3 TMRE-stained samples in a histogram, as in Eq (1) below.",
