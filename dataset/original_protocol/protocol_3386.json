    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSample procurement\nThis section describes the isolation of lipidome and metabolome fractions from patient-derived medulloblastoma (MB) tumor samples and donor-derived NSCs. Procurement of these samples is performed under approval of a human integrated research ethics board, and in collaboration with a clinical team that will provide surgically resected tumor tissue(s), or donor-derived fetal tissue(s). Collection and establishment of MB tumorspheres and NSC neurospheres should be performed as described in Chokshi et al. (2020) and Suk et al. (2022), respectively.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5],6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nNote: Prepare process blanks at the same time as sample procurement. A process blank is comprised of all sample preparation components (excluding the sample itself) and is subjected to the same sample preparation steps. In this case, the process blank should not have any cells, but should have all the reagents used in sample procurement and should be subjected to the same sample preparation steps as described in the following sections. Process blanks ensure that detected metabolites are derived from the biological sample itself.\nSample preparation for LC-MS analysis of metabolome and lipidome\nTiming: approx. 1–2 h depending on number of samples, plus 12–16 h sample drying time.\nThis section describes the extraction of metabolites and lipids from donor-derived human NSCs, and patient-derived MB stem-like tumor cells. This extraction method was adapted from the methyl tert-butyl ether-methanol (MTBE) method described in Matyash et al. (2008) and Ding et al. (2021).7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7],8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]\nCritical: The solvents (i.e., acetonitrile, methanol, MTBE) used in this section are flammable and volatile. Safety goggles, gloves and lab coats are to be worn while handling solvents. Ensure there is adequate ventilation place prior to starting this section of the protocol.\nCritical: Extraction solvents, samples, and pipette tips should be kept chilled throughout the extraction process.",
    "Note: The sample preparation protocol has been optimized for the extraction of metabolites and lipids from a cell pellet of ∼1×106. The volumes in this protocol can be scaled according to the number of cells harvested.\nRe-suspend cell pellets in 255 μL of ice-cold H2O/methanol (30:225, v/v).\nAdd 10 μL of UltimateSPLASH ONE (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL, USA) to each sample.\nCritical: UltimateSPLASH ONE is provided in volatile solvents (i.e., dichloromethane and methanol). Appropriate PPE (i.e., laboratory coats, goggles etc.) are to be worn while handling. UltimateSPLASH ONE internal standard will drip when added to samples. Care should be taken to prevent loss of the internal standard.\nNote: It is recommended to use isotopically labeled internal standards (like UltimateSPLASH ONE) to achieve the highest confidence level of identification. No analogous comprehensive internal standard mix is available for polar metabolites; however, internal standards should be added for known metabolites of interest. Alternatively, the TruQuant Yeast Extract Semi-targeted QC Workflow Kit (IROA Technologies, Sea Girt, NJ, USA) have been used as internal standards for the polar metabolome.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9],10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]\nVortex samples for 30 s.\nSonicate samples for 5 min in a cold-water bath.\nAdd 750 μL of ice-cold MTBE to each sample.\nVortex samples for 30 s.\nShake tubes samples for 10 min at 4°C at 650 RPM in the Thermomixer R (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) temperature block.\nAdd 188 μL of LC-MS water to each tube to induce phase separation.\nVortex samples for 30 s.\nCentrifuge samples for 20 min at 16,000 × g at 4°C.\nTransfer 700 μL of the top (non-polar) component of each sample to a new microcentrifuge tube. This component constitutes the extracted lipidome of the NSC/MB cells.\nCritical: Transfer the organic layer to a new microcentrifuge tube without aspirating the aqueous (bottom) fraction.",
    "Transfer 250 μL of the bottom (aqueous) component of each sample to a new microcentrifuge tube. This component constitutes the extracted polar metabolome of the NSC/MB cells.\nCritical: Cell debris should form as pellets following centrifugation. Transfer the aqueous fraction without disturbing the cell debris pellet. Ensure no cell debris is transferred with the extracted lipidome/metabolome layers.\nEvaporate extracted lipidome/metabolome fractions with the vacuum concentrator (Labconco, Kansas City, MO, USA) at 10°C until fully dried.\nOnce dry, store samples at −80°C until LC-MS analysis.\nNormalization of metabolite and lipid extracts\nTiming: 2 h\nThis section describes the use of DNA quantification for the normalization of lipid and metabolite extracts for LC-MS analysis. Sample normalization is crucial for minimizing non-biological variation. Normalization of metabolite/lipid extracts to DNA levels is recommended as it correlates well with cell number.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] The DNA content is quantified from the residual cell pellets that remain after sample preparation. Other common normalization methods include the use of total protein levels or cell count. Normalization to protein content has been reported to have large variability in metabolite-extracted samples.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]\nCritical: Cancer cells are often aneuploid. The ploidy of the cell line or cells needs to be taken into account when normalizing to DNA levels.\nFrom the remaining cell pellets, remove as much excess solvent as possible.\nAllow the cell pellets to air-dry the excess solvent at 20°C–22°C until dry.\nResuspend the cell pellets in 200 μL of 1 M urea and 0.2% SDS.\nSolubilize the cell pellets at 85°C for 30 min at 650 rpm in the Thermomixer R.\nOnce the cell pellets are dissolved, quantify the DNA content in the solubilized samples in triplicate according to the manufacturer’s instructions for the Quant-iT 1× dsDNA BR Assay Kits, high sensitivity (HS) and broad range (BR) (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA).",
    "Using the quantified DNA values, adjust dried sample reconstitution volumes accordingly.\nCritical: Dried lipid fractions are typically resuspended in 200 μL of isopropanol:acetonitrile (50:50, v/v) for every 6 μg of DNA for the lipidomics method. Dried aqueous fractions are typically resuspended in 100 μL of water:acetonitrile (30:70, v/v) for every 6 μg of DNA.\nLC-MS analysis\nTiming: 17 min/sample for lipidomics method; 21 min/sample for HILIC method\nPrepare mobile phase A and B for the corresponding LC-MS method according to the “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]” section. All LC-MS mobile phases should be prepared fresh prior to each experiment. LC-MS mobile phases can be stored at 20°C–22°C just prior to use.\nPurge the LC lines with the mobile phases.\nEquilibrate the LC system by running the mobile phase A and B at starting conditions.\nAllow source parameters to reach desired conditions.\nConduct the necessary LC-MS pre-run checks according to the manufacturer’s guidelines before running any analysis.\nNote: Pre-run checks of the instrumentation include minimizing background signal by cleaning the ionization source, performing mass calibration, and monitoring pump pressures and spray stability. These pre-run checks help to ensure the acquisition of high-quality data.\nCritical: Dried samples should be resuspended just prior to LC-MS analysis to avoid sample degradation. Reconstitution solvents and reconstituted samples should be maintained at 4°C.\nResuspend the dried fractions in DNA-normalized volumes isopropanol:acetonitrile (50:50, v/v) for the lipidomics method or water:acetonitrile (30:70, v/v) for the HILIC method.\nPrepare LC-MS vials with glass inserts or conical vials for maximum recovery and transfer the resuspended samples to them.\nIn a separate sample vial, transfer an aliquot (∼5 μL) from each sample to make a pooled quality control (QC) samples for column conditioning and analysis stability monitoring.\nReconstitute the process blank samples (See sample procurement[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1] section) with the same solvents as the samples.",
    "Prepare a simple blank vial with the same solvent as the samples.\nNote: Blank and QC injections are needed to ensure reproducibility and stability of the instrument. Blank and QC samples are to be monitored through the course of the experiment for carry-over. Signal intensities, retention time, and pump pressure should be monitored. During acquisition, blank and QC samples can be monitored in real-time in FreeStyle (Xcalibur) or other vendor software.\nTransfer all vials to the autosampler, noting the position of each sample in the autosampler.\nIn Xcalibur, click on “Sequence Setup View”.\nBuild the sample worklist by filling in the fields according to the headers for each sample. This includes Sample ID, File Name, Path, Instrument Method, Position, Injection Volume, etc.\nRandomize the injection order of the samples to avoid order-dependent biases.\nNote: An analysis should begin with a minimum of three simple blank injections. Blank vials are needed to check for the presence of contaminants and carry-over. This is followed by 8–10 QC loads for LC column conditioning. Following the injection of column conditioning samples, several simple blanks (2–3) and process blank samples (2–3) should be analyzed. Blank and process blank samples should also be periodically injected to monitor sample carry-over. Once complete, a final QC sample should be injected prior to sample analysis. Pooled QCs are injected regularly throughout the run and at the end of a run to monitor reproducibility and stability of the instrument. A blank injection should also be conducted immediately following any QC injection.\nSubmit the sequence worklist.\nLC-MS analysis using AcquireX\nTiming: 17 min/injection for lipidomics method; 21 min/injection for HILIC method",
    "AcquireX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) is a generalized data acquisition workflow that generates inclusion and exclusion lists from precursor m/z values and enables acquisition of MS/MS spectra through iterative injections in an automated manner.12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] This results in more MS/MS spectra than standard data-dependent methods, which improves compound identification. The AcquireX acquisition can be used in both the untargeted lipidomics and metabolomics workflows to maximize MS/MS spectra acquisition.\nClick on “AcquireX View” to build the worklist for an AcquireX analysis.\nSelect the “Deep Scan” workflow.\nNote: Deep Scan is one of four data acquisition workflows found in AcquireX. It allows for automated generation of both inclusion and exclusion lists. Using these inclusion and exclusion lists, the workflow determines whether MS/MS is acquired based on user-defined parameters like signal intensity.\nDefine the “Experiment Folder, “Experiment Name”, “Full Scan Method, and “MSn Template Method”.\nNote: The “Full Scan Method” in AcquireX is defined as the method that encompasses the entire mass range and focuses on data acquisition at the MS1 level. The parameters for the “Full Scan Method” are identical to the method described previously in this protocol except for the exclusion of the MS/MS fragmentation parameters. The MSn Template is identical to the full data-dependent MS/MS method described earlier in the protocol.\nSet the AcquireX Experiment Parameters to the appropriate values (Table 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3152_12.csv\nAdd three header blank injections of the solvent blank and define the second header blank as the “Exclusion Reference”.\nAdd three deep scan injections of the pooled QC sample to the end of the header blank injections.\nNote: Three deep scan injections provide deep coverage of the metabolome/lipidome of a particular sample. Additional deep scan injections provide only minimal gain in MS/MS spectra as low intensity precursor ions generate low quality and intensity spectra.",
    "Save and submit the AcquireX worklist.\nMonitor the sample files throughout the entire analysis to ensure instrument stability.\nNote: Monitoring samples and pooled QCs involve checking pressures to ensure stability. The base peak chromatograms of pooled QCs should also be monitored for retention shifts and changes in signal intensity. Internal standards spiked into the pooled QCs can be used as marker compounds to ensure retention time and signal reproducibility. For a given internal standard, retention time shifts should be within 10 s for the lipidomics method and 30 s for the HILIC method. It is recommended that signal intensities of a given internal standard should have coefficient of variations (CV) <15% when comparing repeated injections. CV values are dependent on the abundance of a given metabolite/lipid. As a result, metabolite/lipid levels near the limit of detection may have CVs>15%. Matrix effects are contributors to retention time shifts. They can be identified by comparing the retention time of spiked internal standard in a sample with the retention time of the internal standard alone. Matrix effects should be noted if retention times are used for metabolite/lipid identification.\nData processing using Compound Discoverer\nTiming: 2–6 h depending on the number of files and type of analyses being conducted\nCompound Discoverer (v3.3) is a mass spectrometry data processing and analysis software used for the investigation of metabolites and lipids. It performs peak picking, retention time alignment, MS/MS matching, and local/online database searching to identify metabolites and lipids. It also provides data visualization tools and statistical analysis capabilities to aid in data interpretation.\nOpen Compound Discoverer (v3.3) and click on “New Study and Analysis”.\nDefine the “Study Name” and the “Studies Folder”.\nSelect the desired template workflow to be used in the analysis.",
    "Note: Compound Discoverer provides template metabolomics and lipidomics workflows that can be customized based on various parameters. Detailed information about the individual nodes and parameters can be accessed on the Thermo Fisher Scientific website for the product.\nClick on “Add Files” to input the sample files to be used with the Compound Discoverer analysis.\nUnder “Input File Characterization”, define the sample types and groupings for the analysis.\nOnce complete, under “Sample Groups and Ratios”, define the desired comparisons for statistical analyses.\nClick “Finish” to create the “Study” file.\nIn the “Study” file, check that all desired files are inputted, all groupings are defined, and the workflow is correct.\nModify data processing nodes and parameters accordingly (Table 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl7]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3152_13.csv\nClick “Run” to begin data processing.\nStatistical analyses\nTiming: 3 h\nThis section describes common statistical methods and strategies used to understand metabolomics/lipidomics data.\nFrom the Compound Discoverer results file, apply the appropriate statistical tests and multiple test corrections to calculate p-values.\nNote: The statistical tests and methods of multiple test correction will depend on the study. Common statistical tests include Student’s t-test and ANOVA with post hoc Tukey’s HSD. A common multiple test correction method is Benjamini-Hochberg correction. In datasets where normality or homoscedasticity assumptions are violated, non-parametric statistical tests such as the Mann-Whitney U test or the Kruskal-Wallis test can be considered.\nCalculate the fold-changes (FCs) between the groups being compared.\nUsing p-values and FCs, select significantly different (e.g., p < 0.05 with multiple test correction) metabolic features with large FCs (e.g., FC > 1.5) for identification.",
    "Alternatives: The process of identifying metabolites and lipids is very time-consuming. Thus, it is recommended to have an organized approach to checking identifications. One method is to specifically identify only significantly changing metabolic features. Alternatively, metabolites/lipids in specific metabolic pathways of interest (i.e., glycolysis, TCA cycle) can be selected for identification.\nIdentification of metabolites and lipids\nTiming: varies\nThis section describes strategies for identifying metabolites and lipids from an untargeted metabolomics or lipidomics experiment. Compound Discoverer searches acquired MS/MS spectra against local and online spectral libraries (e.g., mzCloud) to make identifications. Spectral libraries contain reference MS/MS spectra, which can be matched against acquired MS/MS data. Metabolites/lipids identified using this method cannot be completely relied upon due to the presence of in-source fragments, adducts, and co-isolating ions. Because of this, manual curation/annotation of MS/MS data is often required using mirror plots for high confidence identifications.\nCritical: The Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI) categorizes the identification of metabolites into five confidence levels.13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13] The highest confidence level of identification (MSI level 1) requires a reference standard to confirm the structure. Reference standards are not available for every single metabolite/lipid; thus, MS/MS data can be sufficient for putative identification if it matches spectra from literature or spectral libraries (MSI level 2). Typically, identified metabolites and lipids should have at least MSI level 2 and the level of identification should be reported.\nFrom the completed Compound Discoverer Result file, check the MS/MS spectra of individual metabolites and lipids with reference MS/MS spectra.",
    "Note: The performance of these computational tools for identification can vary depending on the metabolite and its fragmentation pattern. Thus, there is no single search tool or algorithm that can reliably match experimental MS/MS data to those found in databases. Generally, an ideal MS/MS match has the correct diagnostic fragments within a small error (<5 ppm) and limited co-isolating/contaminating ions at similar collision energies.\nIf isotopically labeled/reference standards are available, analyzing them using identical LC-MS methods to confirm retention time and MS/MS provides the highest confidence level of metabolite identification (MSI Level 1). If the resulting retention time the reference standard does not match, then additional analyses may be needed to determine the metabolite identity as matrix effects can contribute to retention time shifts.\nNote: Isotopically labeled standards have the same retention times, but m/z shifts corresponding to the incorporated isotopic atoms.\nNote: The combinatorial nature of lipids makes it impossible for authentic reference standards to be available for every single lipid. For species that do not have standards, natural lipid mixes could be used instead. Natural lipid mixes consist of lipids belonging to the same class extracted from a specific source (i.e., Ceramide (Brain) Cat. No. 860052, Avanti Polar Lipids). Lipid species of the same class fragment in a predictable manner. Rules for lipid fragmentation have been previously established and should be used to enhance lipid identifications.14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]\nValidate the fragmentation spectra of lipids using reference standards or lipid mixes.\nPlot mass-to-charge vs. retention time plots (m/z vs. RT) to ensure identified lipids belong to the same class.",
    "Note: In reversed-phase chromatography, lipid species within the same class will elute in a linear manner. Retention time will increase as the length of acyl chains increases. Lipids that violate this trend likely do not belong in the given lipid class. The use of both fragmentation patterns and retention time trends strengthens the lipid identifications when authentic reference standards are unavailable.\nCorrect any incorrect or ambiguous annotations provided by Compound Discoverer.\nData visualization and interpretation\nTiming: 2 h\nThis section describes data visualization methods used to understand and depict metabolomics/lipidomics data. Clear and visually appealing figures simplifies data interpretation. Data plots described here can be generated using programming languages like R and Python.\nOnce metabolite/lipid identifications are complete, export the Compound Discoverer Result file with peak areas as a CSV file.\nGenerate boxplots using peak areas to compare the relative levels of metabolites of interests between groups. This can be done using the ggplot2 package.\nGenerate principal component analysis (PCA) plots. This can be generated using the ggplot2 and ggfortify packages.\nPerform log-transformation and z-score standardization (auto-scaling) on the exported peak areas.\nNote: The scaling and transformation of metabolomics data is dependent on the data acquired. It is important to note that no single scaling and transformation method is suitable for all datasets.\nFrom the analyzed data, perform hierarchal clustering to represent the data.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3152-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Fatty Acid Composition Heatmaps (FACHs) reveal a decrease in saturation levels in the diglycerides of MB cells compared to NSCs",
    "The x-axis of the heatmap depicts the total number of carbons while the y-axis depicts the total number of double bonds on the fatty acids of a particular lipid class. The color scale corresponds to the proportion by which a lipid species makes up the total signal intensity of the lipid class. The gray bars outlining each FACH depict histograms representing the proportional abundance of total carbons or total double bonds for any given lipid species within a class. The lines on the FACHs show the mean fatty acid composition (number of carbons and number of double bonds) of a given lipid class, considering the relative abundance of each individual lipid.\nAlternatives: Pathway analysis (i.e., MetPA, MSEA etc.) can also be done to determine the metabolite classes and metabolic pathways enriched in a particular sample group.15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15],16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16] It is important to note that the method in which the data is shown depends on the content being conveyed.",
    "Alternatives: Information about individual lipid classes’ selectivity for specific fatty acids (chain length and saturation) can be gained by creating Fatty Acid Composition Heatmaps (FACHs). FACHs depict all lipid species within a class based on the number of carbons and double bonds within its acyl chains (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). The colors on the heatmap represent the proportion (percentage) of lipid species containing a specific number of carbons and double bonds within a specific lipid class. Using FACHs, shifts in fatty acid elongation and saturation levels can be visualized and interpreted. This analysis is independent of the amount of sample injected and the absolute concentration levels of lipids within each class, as only the proportions of the FA composition within the same lipid class are considered and compared. This ultimately allows comparisons between different types of cells (size and morphology). Source code for the generation of FACHs is available in our Zenodo data repository."
