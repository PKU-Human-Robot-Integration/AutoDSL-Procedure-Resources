    "All procedures were approved by the Northwestern University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and group housed at a barrier facility at the Center for Comparative Medicine at Northwestern University (Chicago, IL). All animals were housed in 12/12 h light/dark cycle with free access to food and water.\n1. Induce anesthesia\nAnesthetize the mouse with ketamine (125 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) injected intraperitoneally.\n2. Vital signs monitoring every 15 min\nMonitor temperature, respiratory rate, and skin color. The mouse should feel warm to the touch. The skin should appear pink and well perfused. Respiratory rate should range 50–70 breaths per minute.\n3. Pre-surgical procedures\nWeigh all the mice on the day prior to injury induction.\nSterilize one set of surgical instruments by autoclaving for each experimental subject. Sterilize the impacting device before use. \nPrepare a recovery cage by placing a clean cage over an electric heating pad set to “low” setting and positioned in a manner such that the mice can move away from the heat once ambulatory.\nSet up the operating theater within a sterilized laminar flow hood.\n\t\nPosition the stereotaxic operating frame.\nAttach the impacting device to the stereotaxic frame.\nSet the actuating device with the desired biomechanical parameters for velocity and dwell time.\n\t\tNOTE: In this protocol a severe brain injury is described utilizing a 3 mm diameter impact tip via a 5 mm diameter craniectomy with the velocity set at 2.5 m/s and a dwell time of 0.1 s. A wide range of biomechanical parameters may be used to induce the full spectrum of TBI.\nDon new personal protective equipment and sterile gloves.\nShave the fur from the operative site using electric clippers.",
    "Apply protective opthalmic ointment to the eyes of the mouse to prevent corneal injury and drying.\nPlace the mouse into the operating theater.\nPrep the skin with an iodine based surgical scrub alternated with alcohol three times.\n4. Application of controlled cortical impact\nIncise the scalp 1 cm in the midline with a scalpel exposing the skull.\nPosition the mouse within a stereotaxic operating frame by securing the bilateral temporal bones between miniature ear bars and locking the incisors within an incisor clamp creating a stable three-point-hold on the mouse head.\nRetract the scalp away from the operative site with a hemostat or locking forceps to ensure the scalp does not come in contact with the drill bit during craniectomy.\nIdentify the sagittal and coronal sutures on the exposed skull.\n\tNOTE: This protocol centers the craniectomy 2 mm left of the sagittal suture and 2 mm rostral to the coronal suture.\nPerform a craniectomy using a drill with a trephine drill bit.\n\t\nTo perform the craniectomy, first activate the drill at maximum speed and then apply the trephine drill bit perpendicular to the skull at the site of craniectomy.\nApply gentle, even pressure to the drill once contact is made with the skull. A slight “give” will be felt once the drill penetrates through the skull. Do not penetrate the underlying dura.\n\t\tNOTE: This protocol utilizes a 5 mm trephine drill bit to perform the craniectomy.\nUse forceps and a small gauge hypodermic needle to remove the bone flap, fully exposing the underlying dura mater.",
    "Rotate the impactor tip into the operative field and lower it until it makes contact with the exposed dura mater. Once contact is made the instrument’s contact sensor will make an audible tone to alert the surgeon that contact has been made. This will mark the zero point from which the deformation depth is set.\n\tNOTE: This protocol utilizes a 3 mm impacting tip to generate a severe injury. Tips as small as 1 mm may be used to apply more localized injury.\nRetract the impacting tip and set the desired impact depth by lowering the impactor position on the stereotaxic frame.\n\tNOTE: In this protocol we describe a severe injury by setting the deformation depth to 2 mm.\nApply the injury by activating impactor on the actuating device.\nRotate the impact device out of the field and remove the animal from the stereotaxic frame.\n5. Surgical site closure\nControl bleeding from the skull and injured cortical surface with direct pressure from a sterile cotton tipped applicator.\nDry the skull with a sterile cotton tipped applicator.\nClose the scalp over the craniectomy using a commercially available surgical adhesive or monofilament suture.\n\tNOTE: In this protocol a veterinary surgical adhesive is used to close the scalp. The bone flap is not replaced and is discarded.\n6. Post-operative care and monitoring\nAdminister post-operative analgesia (e.g., sustained release buprenorphine 0.1–0.5 mg/kg administered subcutaneously providing 72 h of sustained analgesia).\nPlace the animal in the lateral decubitus recovery position in a clean pre-warmed cage.\nObserve the animals until awake and mobile, then return each mouse to its home cage.\nEnsure free access to food and water. Normal food and water intake typically resume within one to two hours after injury.\nMeasure body weight every three days throughout the experiment.",
