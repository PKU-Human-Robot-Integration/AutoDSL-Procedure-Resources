    "Note: Use nuclease-free tubes and tips (Materials and Reagents sections) for all the steps. Crude mitochondria and ER isolationNote: The method for mitochondria isolation was adapted from a previously described protocol (Wang et al., 2015) with minor modifications. During organelle isolation, the pH value of MitoPrep buffer is 7.4 if not specified. Collect HEK293 cells by centrifuging at 1,000 x g for 2 min at room temperature (RT). Discard the supernatant, and resuspend the cell pellet with 1 ml of PBS. Spin again at 1,000 x g for 2 min at RT. Discard the supernatant.Note: HEK293 cells were cultured in a 15-cm cell culture dish. With a density of ~90%, ~3 x 107 cells were harvested. Resuspend the cells in 1.5 ml ice-cold MitoPrep buffer and transfer the mixture to a 5 ml glass/Teflon homogenizer pre-cooled in an ice bath. Perform 30 strokes on ice.Transfer the homogenate into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge at 800 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Transfer the supernatant to a new microcentrifuge tube.Resuspend the pellet in 1.5 ml MitoPrep buffer. Perform 20 strokes on ice. Transfer the homogenate into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge at 800 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Transfer the supernatant to a new microcentrifuge tube. Spin the supernatants from Steps1c and 1d at 800 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Transfer the supernatants to new microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuge at 11,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellets are crude mitochondria. The supernatants are transferred into two new microcentrifuge tubes and spun at 21,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellets are crude ER.Combine the pellets of mitochondria or ER from the two tubes by resuspending them in 1 ml MitoPrep buffer.",
    "Spin at 11,000 x g for 5 min or 21,000 x g for 10 min to spin down mitochondria or ER respectively.Discard the supernatant and resuspend mitochondria or ER with 30 μl of MitoPrep buffer (pH 7.4). Note: Optiprep gradients can be used for further purification, if purer fractions are needed. Measure protein concentrations with a NanoDrop instrument after diluting 1 μl of protein sample with 19 μl of 0.6% (w/v) SDS. The original protein concentrations are the measured values multiplied by 20. Note: After we add 1 μl of protein sample to 19 μl of 0.6% SDS, the total volume becomes 20 μl, that means the concentration of this diluted protein sample is 1/20 of its original concentration. So, we can calculate the original protein concentration by a factor of 20. Usually, 3 x 107 cells can yield 800 μg of mitochondria and 150 μg of ER. Take out 200 μg of mitochondria (in about 15 μl of MitoPrep buffer, pH 7.4), or 50 μg of ER (in about 10 μl of MitoPrep buffer, pH 7.4), and bring the volume to 60 μl with MitoPrep buffer with a pH value of interest (pH 7.4 and 6.5 are the two values we routinely use). Keep the samples on ice.Notes: Metal ions, metal chelators, or other conditions can be added to the sample before the next step. Some conditions that have effects on the degradation of mitochondrion-associated cytosolic rRNAs have been listed in Table 1.Table 1. Conditions that affect the degradation of mitochondrion-associated cytosolic rRNAsimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190530/20190530194910_7782.jpgFor ER-associated rRNA degradation, the pH value of MitoPrep buffer matters: when the pH is 7.4, degradation is slower; when the pH is lowered to 6.5, the degradation becomes much faster. All these effects have been described in the original paper (Huang et al., 2018).",
    "Divide each sample (60 μl) into 3 microcentrifuge tubes (20 μl per tube). Store one tube at the -80 °C freezer as the first time point (0 min). Transfer the other 2 tubes to 37 °C in a heating block. Incubate the two samples for 30 and 60 min respectively. At each time point, transfer one tube to -80 °C freezer. Store the samples at -80 °C for at least 15 min before the next step.Note: For quality control, prepare another set of the samples and perform the same degradation steps. Then mix the samples with an equal volume of 2x protein loading buffer with DTT, and heat them at 95 °C for 5 min. Separate the proteins in the samples on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. After running the gel at 150 V for 60 min, transfer the proteins in the gel to a nitrocellulose membrane at 450 mA for 70 min and blot the membrane by standard western blotting method. In brief, incubate the membrane at RT for 1 h in 5% skim milk, probe it with primary antibody in 1x TBS-T at RT for 1 h, wash 4 times with 1x TBS-T (5 min/time), incubate with secondary antibody in 1x TBS-T at RT for 1 h, and then wash 4 times with 1x TBS-T (5 min/time). Use Luminol/Enhancer solution for detection of the proteins. Marker proteins used for mitochondria and ER fractions are Mortalin (73.7 kDa) and Calnexin (~68 kDa) respectively. The actual position for Mortalin on a gel is between 70 and 100 kDa, and the position for Calnexin is around 100 kDa.  Take out samples from the -80 °C freezer and add 20 μl of 2x DNA-SDS-EDTA buffer. Vortex, and incubate the samples at 70 °C for 5 min. Cool the samples to RT.Add 0.",
    "5 μl of 1 mg/ml proteinase K to each sample and incubate it at 37 °C in a heating block for 5 min.Run the samples on a 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel with ethidium bromide (EB) (0.5 μg/ml) for 15 min at 150 V in 1x TAE buffer. Capture gel images to check RNA degradation pattern with a UV-based gel imaging system. The flow sheet of this protocol is shown in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190530/20190530194957_6777.jpgFigure 1.
