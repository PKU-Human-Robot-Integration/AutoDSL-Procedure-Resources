    "This protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology.\n1. Mice screening and preparation for the experiment\nSelect wild-type adult (8–10 weeks old) male mice with weight of 20–28 g for the whole experiment.\n\tNOTE: Wild-type C57BL/6 mice are obtained from the Hubei Research Center for Laboratory Animals, Hubei, China.\nRandomly assign all mice to the CSF and the control group. House 3–5 mice in each cage to avoid social isolation stress. The number of mice housed in the control cages is matched with that housed in the paired CSF cages.\n\tNOTE: Mice in the same group cages are pooled to perform follow-up behavioral experiments.\nLocate the control cages in the same room with the CSF cages, to keep the surrounding environment and labor effects identical.\nNumber and mark the mice in each group on their ears using an ear tag for monitoring purposes.\nMaintain ambient temperature and humidity between 21–23 °C and 35%–60 %.\nMaintain the ambient environment in 12-hour light-dark cycle (8:00 AM–8:00 PM light-ON, 8:00 PM–8:00 AM light-OFF), to avoid biased effect on normal sleep rhythm in mice.\nMinimize the noise and interference while the researcher is present in the modeling room.\nProvide mice with sufficient food and water. Use long nozzles with ball valve tips on water bottles, to prevent water leakage upon the platform movements. Fasten the water bottle on top of the cage with a spring to avoid the dislocation of the bottle during rotor running.\n2. Preparation and setting of the orbital rotor\nPrepare an electrically controlled orbital rotor with enlarged platform (67 cm x 110 cm), on which 10 cages can be placed at most.",
    "Set the orbital rotor on during light-ON phase (8:00 AM–8:00 PM) controlled by a program timer, which is the time when mice exhibit the majority of their daily sleep.\nSet the orbital rotor with a speed of 110 rpm and a repetitive cycle of 10 s-on, 110 s-off controlled with a solid-state timer.\n\tNOTE: The load capacity of the platform is 50 kg. The fixed amplitude of the rotor horizon vibrating is 2.5 cm.\nFasten the CSF cages on top of the rotor platform by thick springs to prevent dislocation of cages upon platform rotations.\n3. Chronic sleep fragmentation modeling and monitoring\nPlace cages of the CSF and the control mice into the modeling room for one week prior to experiments, to let mice adapt to the ambient environment.\nAt the beginning of the modeling, ensure that all mice have free access to food and water during orbital rotations.\nAt the beginning of the modeling, observe at least for 1 h to ensure the orbital rotor operating in gear.\nDuring the period of modeling, check that the orbital rotor is operating properly and mice conditions every 2 days to ensure mice have enough food and water. Change beddings of cages weekly.\nDuring the period of modeling, weigh the mice weekly at 8:00 AM when changing the bedding. Remove the mice with significant weight loss from the modeling, and also from the experimental groups.\n\tNOTE: Significant weight loss is defined as weighing less than 20 g lasting for 2 weeks.\nDuring the entire modeling sessions, remove the aggressor, if any, from the cage and, also from the experimental groups.\nAfter the termination of modeling, continue to maintain and feed the mice in the original room.\n4. Morris water maze (MWM) test\nPreparation for the test",
    "Prepare the apparatus of a circular tank filled with warm water (20–23 °C).\nSuspend four signs with different shapes and colors on the curtain surrounding the tank in four quadrant directions as the distant vision reference. Make the water to appear opaque by the addition of powdered milk.\nLocate a platform in the middle of the southwest quadrant.\nThe training test\n\t\nSubject mice to four consecutive trials between 8:00 AM and 12:00 AM each day over a 5-day training period.\nRelease each mouse into the water facing the sidewall at one of four quadrants in four trials. In each trial, allow the mouse to swim for 60 s to find the platform. If the mouse is unable to arrive at the platform within 60 s, guide it to the platform and to remain there for 15 s.\nUse a video tracking system to automatically record the escape latency of mice to find the hidden platform.\nThe probe test\n\t\nConduct the probe test on the sixth day after 5 training days.\nRemove the platform. Release each mouse from the northeast quadrant and allow it to swim for 60 s\nUse a video tracking system to automatically record the track data of mice.\n5. Novel object recognition (NOR) test\nThe familiar phase\n\t\nPlace mice in a tank (length 30 cm, width 28 cm, height 35 cm) in sequence, which contains two copies of objects (A1 and A2). Allow the mice to explore freely (10 min per trial).\nUse a video tracking system to automatically record the track data of mice.\nThe test phase",
    "Conduct the test trial after a 1 h delay of the familiar phase. Replace one of the original objects by a novel object (“novel”) in the tank keeping the other one unchanged. Return the mice to the tank and allow it to explore for 5 min per trial.\nUse a video tracking system to automatically record the time spent in exploration of each object by each mouse.\n\t\tNOTE: The exploration of the object is determined by licking, sniffing, chewing, or moving vibrissae while orienting the nose toward and less than 1 cm from the object. The Discrimination Index (DI) is calculated with the equation (TN − TF)/(TN + TF), where TN = time spent exploring the “novel” object and TF = time spent exploring the “familiar” object.\n6. Open field test (OFT)\nPrepare the apparatus of a tank (30 cm x 28 cm x 35 cm).\nDuring the test, place each mouse into the center of the tank and allow it to explore freely for 5 min. Clean the tank with 75% ethanol after each trial to avoid the leftover effects of the previous mouse.\nUse a video tracking system to automatically record the track data of mice.\n7. Forced swimming test (FST)\nPrepare the apparatus of an open cylindrical vessel, which contains water (20–23 °C) that is 15 cm deep.\nDuring the test, place each mouse into the cylinder and allow it to remain there for 6 min.\nUse a video track system to automatically record the immobility time during the last 4 min of the test by each mouse.\n\tNOTE: The mouse is determined to be immobile when it stops struggling and floats in the water, making only movements which are necessary to keep its head above water.\n8. Data Analysis",
    "Analyze data using statistical analysis software (e.g., GraphPad Prism 6.0).\nExpress all data as the mean ± SEM.\nCompare the escape latency in MWM test between two groups using two-way ANOVA with repeated measures followed by Bonferroni posttests. Other comparisons between the CSF and the control groups are determined by unpaired t tests.\nConsider differences significant if P < 0.05 in all tests.\nSubscription Required.
