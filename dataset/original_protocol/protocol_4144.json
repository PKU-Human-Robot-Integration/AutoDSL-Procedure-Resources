    "Note: For handling cell lines and bacterial cultures, aseptic techniques must be used and work should be carried out in a sterile laminar flow hood when practicable.    Culturing of cell lines   An aliquot of the chosen cell line (approx. 106 cells) stored in liquid nitrogen (see Note 1) was used to seed a 25 cm2 tissue culture flask containing 5 ml complete DMEM. The cultures were grown to 70-80% confluency (approx. 4 x 106 cells) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. INT 407 was grown in low glucose complete DMEM, Hep-2, Hela and undifferentiated HT-29 were grown in high glucose complete DMEM. Differentiated (see Note 2) HT-29 was grown in no glucose complete DMEM at 10% CO2 humidified atmosphere.   The cultures were washed three times with 5 ml 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and 4 ml low glucose incomplete DMEM was added.      Bacterial cell culture   A loopful of V. cholerae strain O395 preserved at -70 °C in LB medium containing 20% glycerol was streaked on LB agar plates and incubated at 37 °C for 16-18 h.   A loopful of V. cholerae culture from the plate was inoculated into 5 ml LB medium and grown with aeration (shaking at approx. 200 rpm in a rotary shaker) at 37 °C for 16-18 h. From this culture, a 1% inoculum (50 µl) was added to 5 ml LB medium and grown to the mid logarithmic phase (OD600 0.5) with shaking at 37 °C.    The V. cholerae culture was centrifuged (5,000 x g, 5 min), washed with 5 ml 1x PBS, and suspended in low glucose incomplete DMEM at a concentration of 109 colony forming units (CFU) per ml (Bacterial cells from approximately 2 ml logarithmic phase cultures in LB medium were suspended in 1 ml incomplete DMEM.).",
    "Bacterial adherence to cell lines   Cell lines grown to 70-80% confluency in 25 cm2 flasks were used.    V. cholerae culture (200 µl, approximately 2 x 108 CFU) in low glucose incomplete DMEM was added to the 70-80% confluent cell lines, resultant multiplicity of infection (MOI) was about 50.    After addition of bacteria, the cell lines were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere for optimum adherence.    After 45 min, the supernatant was discarded and non-adhered bacteria were removed by washing the infected cell line 4 times with 5 ml 1x PBS and then low glucose complete DMEM  (5 ml) was added and incubated for different periods of time (1-12 h).   After the desired time period, the supernatant was discarded and the infected cell line was washed 4 to 5 times with 5 ml 1x PBS.    1 ml of 1% Triton X-100 was added and incubated for 2 min at room temperature with gentle swirling when the cell line could be seen to lyse and detach from the flask. The total culture was collected in 1.5 ml micro centrifuge tubes and vigorous pipetting or vortexing was done. The Triton X-100 treatment lysed the eukaryotic cells but had no effect on the viability of the bacterial cells (see Note 3).    The bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation (5,000 x g, 5 min) at room temperature and the pellet was suspended in 1 ml 1x PBS.   From this suspension 10 μl was added in 990 μl of 0.9% saline solution and bacterial CFU was determined by serial dilution and plating on LB agar plates. Remaining adhered bacterial cells could be used for gene expression studies or other purposes.    Parallel experiments were performed with V. cholerae under identical conditions but without cell line as an unadhered control."
