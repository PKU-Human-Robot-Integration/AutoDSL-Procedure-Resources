    "All methods described here were approved by the Ethics Committee of Union Hospital Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. We obtained the patient's consent to use his surgical footage as a video after the procedure.\n1. Instruments for operation\nEnsure the availability of a surgical microscope system, microsurgical instrument, and microscopic bipolar electrocoagulation.\n2. Preparation for operation\nInclusion criteria\n\t\nInclude all patients diagnosed with azoospermia who agree to undergo surgery. Have all female partners of the patients undergo gynecologic fertility testing\n\t\tNOTE: In the presented study, patients underwent surgery at the hospital between June 2013 and July 2020. All female patients' partners' gynecologic fertility test results were normal.\nEnsure normal serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone in all patients.\nEnsure that there are no genital malformations, hypertension, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, heart disease, pelvic trauma, abnormal psychological or mental disorders, or other serious preexisting diseases or conditions.\nExclusion criteria\n\t\nExclude patients with genital malformations, abnormal psychological or mental disorders, acute urinary tract infection or urinary tuberculosis, severe abdominal trauma or surgery, severe coagulation disorders, or other contraindications to anesthesia or laparoscopy.\nPerform an anesthesia risk assessment on patients prior to the surgery. Ask patients who have been taking aspirin to discontinue it.\nMark the skin 15 cm around the perineum with a skin preparation knife to prepare for the surgery.\nAdminister antibiotics to the patient via intravenous drip 30 min prior to surgery. Ideally, use cefoperazone sodium (2.0 g) together with 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution.\nMake sure that the patient is under general or intraspinal anesthesia.\n3. Procedure\nPlace the patient under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. Then, perform standard disinfection with 1% iodophor while the patient is in the supine position.",
    "Make a 3 cm incision along the mid-scrotal fold. Then, pinch one testicle and incise the flesh membrane to expose the testicular sheath and spermatic cord.\nDissect the fascia between the vas deferens and the spermatic cord vessels. Separate along the space between the vas deferens vasculature and the vasculature of the spermatic cord with a vascular clamp. Secure the vas deferens with tissue forceps and prepare it for vesicocentesis.\nInsert a 24 G cannula needle obliquely 15Â° downward along the long axis of the vas deferens. Pull out the needle core after the obvious tactile breakthrough, and slide the soft trocar to the lumen.\nInject 2 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution into the vas deferens using a 5 mL syringe connected to the 24 G cannula. If resistance is high, this confirms that there is an obstruction in the vas deferens.\nTake a sample of fluid from the syringe and give it to an examiner to examine it under the microscope for sperm.\nAdvance the 3-0 polypropylene suture through the trocar. If there is resistance, it indicates obstruction. Measure the length of the suture to determine the site of obstruction.\n4. Postoperative care\nMake the patient stay in the ICU for ~1-2 h postoperatively, until he fully regains consciousness.\nSend the patient back to the ward when he fully wakes up.\nImplant a catheter for 6-24 h.\nLift the scrotum with underwear for 1 week.\nSubscription Required.
