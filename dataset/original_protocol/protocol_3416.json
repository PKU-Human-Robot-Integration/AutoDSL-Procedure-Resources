    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCross 1: Building a fly strain that contains both MiMIC insertion (on the 3rd chromosome) and split-GAL4 donor (on the 2nd chromosome)\nTiming: 15–30 min to set up genetic crossing, followed by 10–13 days for incubation. Once the F1 progeny flies come out, it takes around 30–45 min in 2–3 consecutive days for collecting the male progeny with appropriate genotypes.\nTo build a fly strain that contains both MiMIC insertion and split-GAL4 donor transgenes for the in vivo swapping, male flies with MiMIC insertion on the 3rd chromosome are crossed with virgin female flies with split-GAL4 donor (VP16/DBD) on the 2nd chromosome. Since many of the existing gene-specific split-GAL4 lines are either DBD or VP16 for a given gene,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] we therefore recommend setting up crosses for both VP16 and DBD split-GAL4 swapping at the same time for each gene to maximize the versatility of pairing with other existing split-GAL4 hemi-drivers.\nCollect approximately 10 virgin female flies from the donor stock yw; pC-(lox2-attB-T2A-split-GAL4)/(CyO); TM2/TM6B.\nSelect lines with appropriate split-GAL4 splicing phase (DBD.0/1/2 or VP16.0/1/2) based on the target gene MiMIC insertion.\nVerify the split-GAL4 donor stock has white+ (from split-GAL4 donor transgene) with the 3rd chromosome balanced (e.g., TM2/TM6B in this case). The presence of CyO balancer is optional, depending on whether the split-GAL4 donor transgene is homozygous or not.\nCheck for the phenotypes corresponding to the markers in the split-GAL4 donor stock, namely: white+ (red/orange eye color), Curly (curly wings), Humeral (extra macrochaetes), and ebony (darker cuticle pigmentation).",
    "Critical: Females must be virgin, otherwise the F1 progenies will be mixed with flies of the original stock genotypes. We recommend collecting virgin females, storing them for 4–5 days in a separate food vial, and only setting up the crosses when there are no larvae in the vial.\nCritical: The splice acceptor nomenclature in the split-GAL4 donor genotype is indicated by the number followed by DBD or VP16. For example, DBD.0 indicated the GAL4DBD donor with a splicing phase 0. It is important to note that a correct splicing phase of the split-GAL4 donor (DBD.0/1/2 or VP16.0/1/2) should be chosen so that the split-GAL4 donor can be spliced in-frame with the transcript of the target gene.\nNote: Readers are encouraged to refer phenotypes associated with genetic markers and balancers to this book: Atlas of Drosophila Morphology: Wild-type and Classical Mutants.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nNote: The information about the coding intronic MiMIC/CRIMIC insertion phase can be found in the GDP Screen Database (https://flypush.research.bcm.edu/pscreen/about.html[href=https://flypush.research.bcm.edu/pscreen/about.html]). For example, MiMIC insertion MI11085 is inserted in the dpr5 coding intronic region and captures both dpr5-RA and dpr5-RB RNA transcripts with splicing phase 1 (dpr5-RA:1, dpr5-RB:1).\nNote: In some cases, the MiMIC-inserted gene has multiple splicing isoforms which require different splicing phases of the split-GAL4 donor (e.g., Dscam1MI07658).\nCollect approximately 5 male flies from the MiMIC stock yw/Y; +; Mi{MIC, y+}XXXMI12345\nNote: Mi{MIC, y+}XXXMI12345 transgene refers to a hypothetical example of MiMIC insertion (MI12345) in the hypothetical target gene (XXX) throughout the protocol.\nAlternatives: This protocol is designed for generating a large batch of split-GAL4 hemi-drivers. If only a few target genes are needed, collect virgin females from the MiMIC stock and collect males from the donor stock. The reciprocal cross simply gives users a flexibility to perform the crosses and has no impact on the results.",
    "Place the virgin female flies from step 1 and the male flies from step 2 in a vial with fresh fly food.\nIncubate at 25°C.\nFlip the parent flies into fresh fly food every 3–4 days for two weeks. Keep both the old vials (containing eggs and larvae) and the new vials (containing the adult parent flies).\nCritical: Remember to pass the crosses regularly (every 3–4 days) so that no F1 progenies are mixed with parent flies.\nNote: Adult flies emerge within about 10 days after the initial cross set up at 25°C. This is generally applicable to all the genetic crosses in this protocol.\nFrom the F1 progenies of the first cross, select approximately 5–10 male flies with split-GAL4 donor on the 2nd chromosome and MiMIC insertion on the 3rd chromosome.\nDiscard female flies, select males for Humeral (extra humeral macrochaetes) and against Curly (curly wings) genetic phenotypic markers.\nAll the selected males should carry white+ (red/orange eye, from split-GAL4 donor) and yellow+ (non-yellow body color, from the MiMIC insertion).\nNote: Selecting against a genetic marker means we select flies without certain genetic markers. In this example, we select for straight wing flies that do not carry CyO balancer.\nNote: Humeral is the genetic dominant phenotypic marker for TM6B balancer.\nNote: Practically, TM6B (Humeral) is preferred over TM2, because the genetic dominant phenotypic marker in TM2 (Ultrabithorax) is harder to identify. However, in some cases, TM2 might be preferred over TM6B, depending on the location of the MiMIC insertion.\nCross 2: Adding additional transgenes that allow for Cre-mediated excision of the split-GAL4 donor and recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) in vivo\nTiming: 15–30 min to set up genetic crossing, followed by 10–13 days for incubation, then 30–45 min in 2–3 consecutive days for progeny collection",
    "The goal of this step is to introduce heat shock inducible Cre recombinase (hs-Cre) and germline expressing phiC31 integrase (vas-phiC31) to the system for the in vivo swapping.\nCollect approximately 10–15 virgin female flies from the stock yw, {y+, hs-Cre}, {vas-phiC31}; +; TM2/TM6B.\nCritical: To facilitate balancing the converted split-GAL4 transgenes, the stock line (hs-Cre, vas-phiC31) needs to be balanced on the chromosome of targeted MiMIC/CRIMIC insertion (in this example case, the 3rd chromosome needs to be balanced with TM2/TM6B).\nCritical: The hs-Cre, vas-phiC31 dual-recombinase transgene must be carried on the X chromosome of the female fly, as the X chromosome of the male progenies (collected in step 9) is from the female parent. The hs-Cre transgene is thought to be constitutively and ubiquitously expressed even in the absence of heat shock.\nPlace the virgin female flies from step 6 and the male flies from step 5 in a vial with fresh fly food.\nIncubate at 25°C.\nFlip the parent flies into fresh fly food every 3–4 days for two weeks. Keep both the old vials (containing eggs and larvae) and the new vials (containing the flies).\nSelect approximately 10–15 male flies with hs-Cre, vas-phiC31/Y on the 1st chromosome, donor construct on the 2nd chromosome, and MiMIC insertion on the 3rd chromosome from the F1 progenies of the cross 2.\nDiscard female flies, select males for white+ (red/orange eye color), Humeral (extra macrochaetes) and against ebony (darker cuticle pigmentation).\nNote: TM2 and TM6B balancers carry the recessive phenotypic marker ebony, so darker cuticle pigmentation indicates that the fly carries TM2/TM6B on the 3rd chromosome.\nCross 3: Excise and circularize the split-GAL4 donor for recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) in vivo",
    "Timing: 15–30 min to set up genetic crosses, followed by 10–13 days for incubation, then 1–2 h in 2–5 consecutive days for progeny collection\nThe selected male flies from step 9 will be crossed with double balancer virgin females. The constitutively active expression of Cre recombinase will excise and circularize the split-GAL4 donor cassette from its original locus and the RMCE can be further mediated by phiC31 integrase driven by vasa promoter in the germline to replace the targeted MiMIC/CRIMIC insertion with split-GAL4 cassette.\nSelect approximately 20 virgin female flies from the double balancer stock yw; Sp/CyO; Dr/TM3.\nPlace the virgin females from step 10 and the male flies from step 9 in a vial with fresh fly food.\nIncubate at 25°C.\nFlip the parent flies into fresh fly food every 3–4 days for two weeks.\nKeep the new vials (containing the adult flies) and move the old vials (containing the eggs and larvae) at 25°C.\nCritical: Check adult fly number after each flipping and replenish the adult flies (virgin females from step 10 and the male flies from step 9) as needed. Therefore, it is crucial to keep Cross 2 (step 7) ongoing until successful split-GAL4 candidates are verified.\nSelect all the F1 male progenies that have split-GAL4 donor successfully inserted to the target gene (regardless of the integration orientation).\nSelect the male flies against Humeral (extra macrochaetes), discard all the female flies and other male flies.\nWithin the male flies selected in sub-step a), select flies with loss of yellow+ (yellow-, paler cuticle pigmentation).\nCritical: Sub-step a) must be done before b), as the TM3/TM6B flies containing ebony marker will confound the identification of yellow marker.",
    "Note: The yellow phenotype marks for the loss of yellow+ on MiMIC insertion, indicating a successful RMCE event between MiMIC and split-GAL4 donor.\nNote: Collect as many male flies as possible to maximize the success rate of identifying flies with the correct insertion orientation of the split-GAL4 donor. Selecting flies with the loss of white+ is not necessary since the split-GAL4 donor can be removed in the cross 4.\nCross 4: Set up single male candidate male crosses for genotyping PCR\nTiming: 30–45 min to set up genetic crosses, followed by 3–6 days for incubation\nIndividual male flies collected in the step 13 will be crossed with double balancer virgin females. The goal is to pass down the transgene of MiMIC/CRIMIC swapped with split-GAL4 in each selected male fly. This step is a prerequisite for genotyping PCR to verify the orientation of the swapped split-GAL4 cassette (same or opposite with respect to the orientation of the target gene).\nSelect approximately 30 virgin female flies from the double balancer stock yw; Sp/CyO; Dr/TM3.\nSet up single-male fly crossing.\nPlace individual male flies from step 13 in separate vials with fresh fly food.\nPlace 2–3 virgin female flies from step 14 to every vial in a).\nCritical: Make sure there is only one male fly in each vial. The candidate split-GAL4 insertion in the progenies must be identical among the F1 generation and to the parent, so that we can infer the orientation of donor in the progeny flies by sacrificing and testing the parent.\nIncubate at 25°C.\nNote: Larvae will be visible within 3–6 days after the initial crossing.",
    "When larvae are visible, anesthetize adult flies by CO2 and isolate the single male fly into a 0.2 mL PCR microtube. The female flies can be either transferred into the new fresh fly food vial or remained in the old fly food vial. The original food vials with larvae can be moved to room temperature (around 20°C–23°C) to slow down the growth while waiting for the genotyping PCR result (steps 21–26).\nPause point: The male flies can be stored at -20°C. gDNA extraction can be done on another day when more samples of male flies are collected. It is recommended to extract gDNA within a week of collecting the male flies at -20°C. The extracted DNA can be stored at 4°C for at least two weeks.\nNote: If no larvae came out from the single fly crosses, discard the cross and screen other candidates. If the male fly is dead in the food vial, extracting genomic DNA from the dead male will work as long as the larvae in the single fly crosses are visible.\nAdjustment for targeting MiMIC insertion on the 2nd chromosome\nNote: yw; If/CyO; pC-(lox2-attB-T2A-split-GAL4)/TM6B flies are used in Step 1.\nNote: yw, {y+, hs-Cre}, {vas-phiC31}; Sp/CyO; + flies are used in Step 6.\nNote: Select the male flies for yellow (paler cuticle pigmentation) and either Sternopleural (extra number of bristles on the sternopleurite) or Curly (curly wings) in Step 13, discard all flies that have both Sternopleural and Curly,\nAdjustment for targeting CRIMIC insertion\nNote: CRIMIC insertion has 3XP3-GFP marker (eye/ocelli-specific expression of GFP). In step 13, select the male flies for loss of 3XP3-GFP under the fluorescence microscope. The loss of 3XP3-GFP marker indicates a successful RMCE event between CRIMIC and split-GAL4 donor.\nSingle fly gDNA extraction\nTiming: 1–1.5 h",
    "In this step, genomic DNA will be extracted from single adult male fly.\nPrepare gDNA squishing buffer (gDNA extraction buffer + Proteinase K).\nAdd 10 μL of Proteinase K to every 1 mL of squishing buffer (1:100 ratio).\nEach fly requires 50 μL of gDNA squishing buffer (e.g., prepare 1000 μL of gDNA extraction buffer for 20 flies)\nVortex the tube to mix well.\nCritical: Proteinase K should be stored at -20°C and must be added to the gDNA extraction buffer freshly right before using.\nHomogenize the adult flies in the gDNA squishing buffer.\nDraw up 50 μL of gDNA squishing buffer using P200 pipette tip.\nHomogenize the fly tissue by crushing the adult male using the pipette tip without expelling any liquid. It is normal that a small amount of liquid will still leak from the pipette tip.\nDispense all 50 μL gDNA squishing buffer to the 0.2 mL PCR microtube.\nSpin down the tubes in a microcentrifuge.\nNote: To completely crush the flies, smash the fly before it floats around in the liquid. Usually, it takes 30 seconds to effectively homogenize the fly.\nPerform gDNA extraction.\nIncubate at 37°C for 30 min followed by 95°C for 3 min to inactivate the Proteinase K reaction.\nSpin down the fly debris in a microcentrifuge and use the supernatant containing gDNA for PCR reaction.\nNote: This reaction can be performed in a thermocycler or any heat block/water bath that fit PCR microtubes.\nPause point: The gDNA can be stored at 4°C for at least two weeks. Note that the gDNA solution should be re-spun down right before the PCR step. We recommended to proceed genotyping PCR in a week so that users can know which candidate crosses should be maintained.\nGenotyping PCR\nTiming: 2–2.5 h",
    "This section describes steps to validate the successful insertion of split-GAL4 donor cassette and to determine the orientation of the cassette integration. The orientation is critical because in-frame translation of the split-GAL4 cassette with the gene-of-interest’s preceding exon can only be achieved when the orientation of the split-GAL4 is the same as that of the gene-of-interest. PCR will be performed on the gDNA extracted in Steps 18–20.\nSet up the PCR reaction.\nAdd reagents to a PCR tube as described in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3181_3.csv\nFlick the tube to mix all contents, then spin down in a microcentrifuge to make sure all the liquid remains at the bottom.\nNote: Two PCR reactions (reaction 1 & 2, as detailed in Tables 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]) with two different primer sets are required for each gDNA sample to determine the split-GAL4 insertion orientation.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3181_4.csv\nNote: Flies with GAL4DBD transgenes (e.g., BDSC# 82987, wg[Sp-1]/CyO; Mi{Trojan-GAL4DBD.2}Gad1[MI09277-TG4DBD.2]/TM6B, Tb[1]) or with VP16 transgene (e.g. BDSC# 60326 y[1] w[∗]; Mi{Trojan-dVP16AD.1}Shaw[MI01735-TdVP16AD.1]) can be used as a positive controls. A negative control without adding gDNA should be included in PCR reaction.\nOptional: Master mix solutions can be prepared for large number of gDNA samples that require the same primer sets. Combine forward primers: reverse primers: nuclease-free water in 1:1:17 ratio for the amount needed. Set up PCR reaction by adding 19 μL of master mix solutions and 1 μL of gDNA template to a PCR tube containing lyophilized PCR premix.\nAlternatives: The lyophilized PCR premix is used in this protocol because it has dNTPs, enzymes, buffer, and tracking dye premixed. Other PCR reagents or kits can also be used according to manufacturer’s instructions.\nRun the PCR reaction in the thermocycler.\nRefer to the program shown in Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3181_5.csv\nAfter the reaction, spin down the tubes in a microcentrifuge.",
    "Pause point: The PCR product can be stored at 4°C for at least a week, and gel electrophoresis can be done on another day.\nGel electrophoresis and imaging\nTiming: 1.5–2 h\nThis step will enable the visualization of the PCR results and thus help to determine the orientation of the split-GAL4 insertion into coding intronic MiMIC lines. 1% agarose gel will be used for electrophoresis.\nPrepare the 1% agarose gel.\nCalculate the desired amount of 1× TAE buffer and agarose. The amount of 1× TAE buffer and agarose used is in 10 mL: 0.1 g ratio. For example, a 2 × 24 wells gel needs 150 mL 1× TAE buffer and 1.5 g agarose.\nAdd the desired amount of agarose and 1× TAE buffer into the Erlenmeyer flask.\nHeat in microwave until boiling.\nOnce it boils, swirl it to help dissolve the remaining agarose.\nRepeat steps c) and d) 2 more times.\nWait until the liquid is warm, add the desired volume of 1% ethidium bromide to the agarose solution in the Erlenmeyer flask (1.5 μL of 1% ethidium bromide per 50 mL gel). Swirl the flask to distribute the ethidium bromide into the solution.\nPour the mixture into the desired-size gel mold and add combs.\nLet the gel cool for more than 30 min.\nNote: Ethidium bromide is carcinogenic, and the gel should be discarded according to each institution’s regulations. Avoid touching the ethidium bromide-contaminated area without personal protective equipment.\nNote: Use a rubber hand cover to swirl the hot flask in step d. Pay special attention to the liquid as it might undergo superheating in the microwave and boils over violently when swirling.\nAlternatives: Several alternatives to ethidium bromide such as SYBR Safe DNA Gel Stain can be used according to the manufacturer’s instructions.",
    "Critical: Make sure there are no air bubbles in the gel after adding combs to the gel mold. Air bubbles will distort the structure of the well and hinder the interpretation of the imaging result. If the air bubbles are present in the well, use a pipette tip to remove them.\nAgarose gel electrophoresis.\nCorrectly orient the gel so that the lanes align with the electric field. The wells should be placed near the negative post.\nAdd 1× TAE buffer to cover the gel and the wells.\nPipette 10 μL of the 1 kb ladder (with loading dye added) into the leftmost well of each row.\nPipette 15–20 μL of PCR sample into other wells of the gel.\nRun the electrophoresis. Maintain the voltage between 90–120 V. The runtime depends on the size of the gel. Make sure the bands take up most of the lane.\nGel imaging.\nTransfer the gel and the gel tray to the gel imager.\nSlide gel onto the sample stage and center the gel on the monitor.\nConfigure the imager to ethidium bromide mode and image under UV transilluminator.\nSave or print out the image as needed.\nNote: The gel containing ethidium bromide should be disposed to the designated area after imaging according to each institution’s regulations.\nGel annotation\nCompare with positive controls of the different insertion orientation and determine the split-GAL4 insertion orientation of the samples."
