    "Notes: Pre-warm all tissue culture reagents (see Recipes), to 37 °C prior to experiment. This protocol was performed with sterile technique under biosafety level two conditions. Grow alveolar macrophages (AMs) (Figure 1A)Thaw cryovial (1 x 106 cells/1.0 ml), transfer contents of vial to a 15 ml tube and centrifuge for 3 min at 1,300 x g (4 °C).Decant supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in 1 ml of pre-warmed media (see Note above).Transfer cell re-suspension into a T-75 tissue culture treated flask. Incubate the tissue culture flask for 48-72 h in the incubator (see Equipment #6).Replace media in the tissue culture flask every 24 h prior to experiment.Allow AM’s to grow to 70%-80% confluency in the tissue culture flask prior to use in an experimental tissue culture plate.Seed AMs in tissue culture plate (Figure 1B)Remove media from the T-75 flask and wash cells with 5 ml 1x DPBS.Discard 1x DPBS wash.Trypsinize tissue culture flask by adding 3 ml of trypsin for 4 min at 37 °C.Gently scrape the bottom of the flask to remove attached cells.Agitate flask and observe under an inverted light microscope to ensure that > 90% of the cells have detached. Neutralize trypsin by adding 6-8 ml pre-warmed media.Remove cell suspension from the flask and transfer to a 15 ml conical tube.Spin down cells at 480 x g for 5 min, then remove as much supernatant as possible.Resuspend cells in 3-5 ml of RPMI (pre-warmed to 37 °C).Take 10 μl of the cell resuspension and mix with 10 μl trypan blue. Calculate the concentration of the cell suspension using a hemocytometer as described in Tachibana et al. (2016 and 2017). Equation for calculating concentration using the hemocytometer:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190114/20190114012802_6627.jpgEnsure no excessive cell doublets are present microscopically. We recommend to re-dissociate excessive cell clumping.",
    "Dilute cell suspension to the actual final volume of 5 x 105 cells/ml in RPMI.Aliquot 1 ml RPMI cell suspension per well to a 24-well flat bottom plate.Incubate overnight at 37 °C to enable cells to become adherent.Challenge cells with binge alcohol dose (Figures 1C and 1D)Bring absolute ethanol (200 proof) to room temperature. Replace media and add media supplemented with ethanol reaching a 0.08% v/v concentration in 1 ml (see Recipes). For negative control add media without ethanol. Challenge cells with binge alcohol dose for 3 h. Wash cells with 1x DPBS and replace media with antibiotic-free media.Note: Incubator water bath is replaced with water supplemented with ethanol reaching a 0.08% (v/v) concentration. Atmosphere ethanol concentration is equivalent to tissue culture media alcohol concentration to minimize evaporation.  Stimulation (Figure 1E)Prime cells: remove cell supernatant and add fresh RPMI media with 400 U/ml IFN-γ, incubate at 37 °C for 8 to 12 h. Replace media for other wells without 400 U/ml IFN-γ for “no- IFN-γ” control. Note: Alveolar macrophages are stimulated with IFN-γ after alcohol challenge and prior to viable bacterial challenge. No additional exogenous LPS stimulation is required.Bacterial preparation and infection (Figure 1F)For each study, utilize frozen stock cultures (Burkholderia spp.) and inoculate LB broth (see Recipes) and incubate overnight at 37 °C in an orbital shaker incubator.Dilute overnight bacterial culture 1:100 (0.1 ml into 9.9 ml LB broth) and allow to grow to late-logarithmic phase measured by optical density (OD) at 600 nm.When OD reaches 0.3 to 0.5 absorbance, collect bacteria in 1 ml by centrifugation (2,500 x g for 5 min) and resuspend in 1 ml of antibiotic-free RPMI media.From preliminary colony forming unit (CFU) plate counts, adjust the volume to provide multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1:1 CFUs in 20 μl.",
    "Determine the MOI (MOI = number of bacteria per alveolar macrophage cell) and alter the inocula preparation accordingly. For an MOI of 1, add 5 x 105 CFU of B. thailandensis per well containing 5 x 105 AM cells. Note: The amount of bacterial culture added will depend upon the density of the bacteria in the media. For this assay, a cell:bacteria ratio of 1:1 is used to allow initial engulfment to occur and further intracellular killing to be monitored. A preliminary experiment should be conducted to determine total CFUs/1 ml for OD used in assay after bacteria are resuspended in antibiotic-free RPMI media.  Infect alveolar macrophage monolayers per well by tilting the tissue culture plate toward you while administering the bacteria into pooled media. Do not disturb adhered macrophage monolayer with pipette tip. For negative control add 1x DPBS per well.Centrifuge the cell culture plate for 5 min at 250 x g to increase interaction between cells and bacteria (see Equipment #16). Allow cells and bacteria to co-culture for 3 h.Elimination of extracellular bacteria (Figure 1G)Note: Media and instruments in contact with viable bacteria were sterilized with 70% ethanol, 10% bleach, and DI water. Discard supernatant from the tissue culture plate into 10% bleach.Wash cell monolayers with pre-warmed 1x DPBS twice.Replace media in the tissue culture plate with RPMI supplemented with 250 μg/ml Kanamycin and incubate monolayers for 1 h. Note: 250 μg/ml will eliminate ≥ 90% bacteria in 1 h and maintain ≥ 95% viability of macrophage cells. To maintain cell viability, antibiotic concentration is reduced after 1 h.  Remove media and replace with RPMI media supplemented with 50 μg/ml Kanamycin. Incubate cells at 37 °C for a total of 4 and 8 h post infection.Macrophage lysis and measurement (Figure 1H)Discard media and replace with 0.",
    "5 ml of 0.1 % Triton X-100 lysis buffer (see Recipes).Homogenize cell monolayers completely by pipetting up and down several times using a P1000 Pipetman (i.e., at least 50 times) until no clusters of cells are observed. Transfer entire contents of each well into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes and label.Spin down cells at 500 x g for 10 min then remove as much solution as possible. Re-suspend cells in 1 ml of pre-warmed LB media.Serial dilute (i.e., 1:10) each sample in sterile 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes.Apply 50 μl of re-suspended cell lysate onto pre-warmed LB agar plates (see Recipes).Spread contents of cell lysate over the surface of the LB agar plate with a sterile L-shaped spreader (i.e., hockey stick).Allow pre-labeled plates to stand right-side up for 10 min before inverting and storing at 37 °C. Incubate LB agar plates for 48 h. Note: At 24 h incubation, plates should be removed from the incubator and CFU’s quantified. Some colonies may appear after 24 h. Plates should be validated and further analyzed at 48 h post initial incubation. Quantify CFU’s by utilizing the following equation: (CFU’s x DF)/volume spread over surface of LB plateDF = dilution factor utilized to grow bacteriaCFU’s = number of total colonies counted on a single plateFor example: 150 colonies of B. thailandensis in the plate with dilution 3 (1:1,000); 150 x 103 (dilution factor)/0.050 ml (volume spread on LB plate) = 3 x 106 CFU/mlimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190114/20190114012557_4824.jpgFigure 1. Representative image at different time points of binge alcohol and phagocytosis protocol. A. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) grown in a T-75 tissue treated flask. B. Quantified AMs are seeded into a 24-well plate tissue culture at a density of 5 x 105 cells/well. C. AMs are challenged with a single binge alcohol dose (0.08% v/v). D.",
    "Cells are incubated in a low evaporative tissue culture plate and the binge alcohol compensation system is applied (white arrow). E. AMs are primed with IFN-γ post alcohol challenge. F. AMs are infected and tissue culture plate is centrifuged to increase AM-bacteria interaction for engulfment and intracellular invasion. G. AMs are treated with 250 μg/ml for 1 h, followed by 50 μg/ml kanamycin to eliminate extracellular bacteria. H. After 4 and 8 h post infection, AMs are washed, lysed, serial diluted, and viable bacteria grown on LB agar plates. CFUs are quantified and averaged per experimental group compared to control (non-alcohol treated cell)."
