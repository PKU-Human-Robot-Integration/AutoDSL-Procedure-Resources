    "1. Animal Procedures\nThis protocol has been designed in compliance with the European Communities Council Directive of November 24, 1986 (86/609/EEC) and has been approved by our institutional committee on animal welfare (CETEA-CEA DSV IdF).\nInjections with EdU/BrdU and irradiation of E14.5 pregnant mice (Figure 2A).\n\t\nPrepare a solution of EdU at 1 mg/ml and BrdU at 5 mg/ml in PBS. Perform an intra-peritoneal injection (IP) of 100 µl of EdU solution using a 25 G needle into pregnant mice. 1.5 hr later, irradiate the mice (total body irradiation) at 0 Gy or 2 Gy (0.6 Gy/min). Immediately after, inject (IP) 200 µl of BrdU solution using a 25 G needle into the pregnant mice.\nPreparation of coronal slices of embryonic brains.\n\t\nAt 1 hr or 4 hr after irradiation, euthanize the pregnant mice by carbon dioxide.\nOpen the abdominal cavity over three centimeters using scissors. Separate the two uterine horns from the rest of the uterus by sectioning both extremities of the horns. Transfer the uterine horns into a Petri dish containing PBS 0.6% glucose. Open the uterine horns with the forceps in order to isolate the embryos. Remove the amniotic sac of each embryo using forceps.\nDissect embryonic heads with forceps and fix them by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, pH=7.4) O/N at 4 °C.\nRinse embryonic heads in PBS for at least one night at 4 °C. Heads can be kept in PBS for several days.\nEmbed heads in paraffin using a vacuum infiltration processor as indicated in Table 1. Heads embedding can also be performed under a chemical hood for ethanol and xylen baths, and then in a 65 °C oven for the paraffin baths.\nPrepare 5-µm thick coronal sections with a microtome.\nMount onto polylysine-coated microscope slides.",
    "Slides can be kept at room temperature (RT) for several months.\n2. EdU/BrdU Staining\nDeparaffinization and antigen unmasking\n\t\nDeparaffinize the paraffin-embedded brain sections by immersion of slides in 3 baths of toluene for 5 min.\nRehydrate for 3 min in 2 baths of each solutions of decreasing ethanol concentration as following: ethanol 100%, ethanol 95%, ethanol 70%, and 5 min in H2O. Slides can be kept in deionized water for several hr.\nBoil the slices for 10 min in citrate solution (10 mM, pH 6), and then incubate in deionized water for 5 min.\nEdU staining\n\t\nPerform EdU detection according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Permeabilize cells with 0.5% triton X-100 in PBS for 10min.\nPrepare 1X EdU buffer additive by diluting the 10X solution in deionized water. This solution should be freshly made and used on the same day.\nPrepare EdU reaction cocktail, including EdU Alexa Fluor 488 azide. It is important to add the ingredients following the order listed in Table 2, otherwise, the reaction will not proceed optimally. Use the EdU reaction cocktail within 15 min of preparation.\nRemove the permeabilization buffer (step 2.1.1), then wash twice with PBS.\nAdd 150 µl of EdU reaction cocktail, put a coverslip, and incubate for 30 min in the dark at RT.\nRemove the EdU reaction cocktail, then wash once with PBS.\nBrdU staining\n\t\nPrepare saturation buffer with 7.5% goat serum and 7.5% fetal bovine serum in PBS. Add 150 µl of saturation buffer on brain slices, put a coverslip, and incubate for 1 hr at RT to block non-specific antibody binding.\nRemove the coverslip. Add 150 µl of mouse anti-BrdU primary antibody diluted at 1/300 in saturation buffer, put a coverslip and incubate O/N at 4 °C.\nRemove the coverslip, then wash 3 times in PBS.",
    "Add 150 µl of goat anti-mouse-Alexa594 secondary antibody diluted at 1/400 in saturation buffer, put a coverslip, and incubate for 1 hr at RT.\nRemove the coverslip, then wash once in PBS.\nNuclear staining: add 150 µl of 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) at 1 µg/ml in PBS, put a coverslip and incubate for 2 min at RT.\nMount slides in mounting medium.\n3. Analysis\nExamine brain sections under a fluorescence microscope with a 20X objective or a confocal microscope and acquire images in three channels (488 nm, 594 nm and UV) as separates files.\nStack images with Photoshop software.\nAnalyze brain sections in a standard sector of the dorsomedial cerebral wall. This sector is 100 µm in its medial-lateral dimension and is divided into 18 bins (or more) of 10 µm height in its radial dimension using a grid superposed on images (Figure 1) as previously described31.\n\t\nAlign the grid such as the first bin is at the ventricular surface, with its long axis parallel to the ventricular border. Then number the labeled EdU, BrdU and/or pyknotic nuclei (corresponding to apoptotic nuclei) in each bin. Number a nucleus located on the boundary of two bins in the bin which contains its larger part, or in the lower bin, when the nucleus occupies equal areas within the two bins.\nStatistical analysis.\nAnalyze at least two cortical slices per embryo. Repeat experiments on at least 3 embryos from different litters. Results should be given as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical analyses are conducted with Graphpad Prism using two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni multiple comparison posthoc tests.Subscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
