    "All procedures executed are approved by the Indiana University School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and follow National Institute of Health guidelines.\n1. Surgical Technique\nMaintain aseptic technique during this procedure by using sterile gloves, instruments, and a sterile surgical field according to NIH guidelines25. Sterilize tools before beginning surgery by autoclaving them (see Table of Specific Reagents/Equipment for complete list). Use a glass bead sterilizer to sterilize tools during the operation.\n2. Anesthesia and Preparation\nAnesthetize the mouse in an anesthesia box with a mixture of 0.9 L/min oxygen and 2.5% isoflurane using a veterinary isoflurane vaporizer system. Ensure that the mouse does not respond to changes in body position before removing it from the box.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to the mouse’s eyes to protect them from drying out.\nSwitch the gas flow from the box to the nose cone. Place the mouse squarely on its left side on a heated pad covered with a surgical pad and absorbent bench paper with its nose and mouth inside the cone. Continuously monitor the mouse’s breathing rhythm and rate and adjust isoflurane levels as needed (between 2.5 - 3% isoflurane) to maintain an adequate level of anesthesia, and use the toe pinch reflex to confirm total sedation.\n3. Surgical Approach\nAlign and focus the stereoscope with the surgical field. Adjust the nose cone and tape it down so that it is positioned along the edge of the visual field.",
    "With the mouse lying on its left side, tape the edge of the right ear to the nose cone, exposing the area behind the ear where the incision will be made. Ensure that the posterior auricular vein travels horizontally across the ear. Note that the correct placement of the animal and taping of the ear are crucial in order to quickly find the facial nerve.\nWet the fur on and behind the ear with 70% ethanol and shave the surgical site using a razor or scalpel blade. Pre-wetting the fur makes shaving easier in this anatomical location.\nClean the skin with an iodine solution, such as Betadine surgical scrub (7.5% povidone-iodine), followed by 70% ethanol. Repeat this cleaning two more times to thoroughly disinfect the area.\nTo determine where to make the incision, trace the posterior auricular vein from the ear caudally to the area posterior to the ear protuberance. Using spring scissors, make a 4 mm incision 2 - 3 mm posterior to the protuberance.\nDissect through the subcutaneous fat and fascia using blunt dissection. Avoid direct cutting with the scissors because blood vessels or muscle tissue could be easily damaged.\nIf bleeding occurs, apply pressure to the surgical site with a sterile cotton swab for at least 30 sec. If significant fluid loss occurs, inject the mouse intraperitoneally with up to 0.5 ml of sterile 0.9% saline solution using a 25 or 27 G needle.\nUse several key landmarks, the spinal accessory nerve, ear canal, and anterior digastric muscle (described below), to locate the facial nerve. Dissect around these landmarks until the branches of the facial nerve are visualized. The nerve will appear as a significant solid white structure when it is revealed and a layer of fascia adheres it to the underlying structures.",
    "Find the spinal accessory nerve, which travels from the caudal portion of the skull to innervate the trapezius muscle, once the subcutaneous fat and fascia have been dissected. The facial nerve is deep to the spinal accessory nerve.\nFind the cartilaginous ear canal that looks pearly white and can be seen rostral to the facial nerve.\nFind the muscle belly of the anterior digastric muscle that lies on top of and caudal to the facial nerve.\nWhen the main branches of the facial nerve are visualized, trace them dorsally to find their origin from the stylomastoid foramen. Using fine tipped Dumont forceps #5/45 to hold the surgical site open, advance the spring scissor tips following the nerve’s path, then move the forceps dorsally to keep the newly advanced area open.\nVisualize the trunk of the facial nerve with the zygomatic, buccal, and marginal mandibular branches at this point.\n\tNOTE: The temporal branch will be found closer to the foramen. The marginal mandibular nerve branches into its upper and lower parts closer to the jaw, thus those nerve branches will not be visible at this level.\n\t\nIf performing a nerve transection, stabilize the nerve gently with the fine tip forceps and cut the nerve with the spring scissors. Avoid applying too much traction to the nerve with the forceps to prevent avulsing the nerve from the brainstem. Push the stumps away from each other, or cut and remove a portion of the distal nerve to ensure that no reconnection can occur.",
    "If performing a crush injury, use Dumont #5/45 forceps to compress the nerve for 30 sec using constant pressure to sever all axons, then repeat this crush at a second angle perpendicular to the first crush site. Avoid applying variable amounts of pressure during the 30 sec crush, otherwise the injury will be inconsistent between animals.\n4. Closing and Recovery\nReposition the fat and muscles over the underlying structures.\nApproximate the edges of the incision and close the wound using a 7.5 mm wound clip. Sutures or glue are also acceptable for wound closure.  Postsurgical analgesics can be provided at this time.   \nRemove the tape from the mouse’s ear. Turn off the isoflurane flow and allow the mouse to breathe pure oxygen for 30 sec to 1 min. Place the mouse in an empty cage with no bedding to recover from anesthesia.\nWhen the mouse is recovered, examine its behavior for confirmatory signs of facial paralysis. The whiskers will be paralyzed and angled back towards the cheek, the nose will be deviated, and the eye will not blink in response to a puff of air.\nHouse animals jointly after surgery if they are female. Avoid housing male mice jointly because they are more aggressive and tend to forcibly remove their cagemate’s wound clips, which leads to infection. Provide postsurgical analgesics at this time, if necessary.\nMonitor the mice once a day for several days after the operation to ensure that no infection or other complication occurs postoperatively. Remove wound clips 7 - 10 days after the surgery if they have not fallen out on their own.\nApply lubricating eye ointment to the affected eye daily to prevent corneal complications, either until the eye blink reflex is recovered or until euthanasia.\nSubscription Required.
