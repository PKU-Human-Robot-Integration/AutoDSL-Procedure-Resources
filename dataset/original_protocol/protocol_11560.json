    "The experiments presented here were approved by the Veterinary Office of the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland and were carried out according to national and institutional regulations.\n1. Feeding Conditions\nNOTE: All training sessions are performed under a scheduled feeding protocol.\nFeed the rats 50 g/kg of standard chow once per day, after training is completed. This amount of food is sufficient to prevent major weight loss (body weight is >90% of free-feeding weight), but small enough to ensure reproducible behavioral conditioning. Weigh the rats daily to ensure their body weight remains stable.\n\tNOTE:Â Additional overnight (10-12 h) food deprivation may be useful prior to the first reward-touch session (step 2.3).\n2. Training Procedure for a Reach-and-pull Task\nPreparation: Allow the rats to habituate to their new home cages for at least a week after arrival in the animal facility. Handle the rats regularly during this time and give dustless precision pellets in the home cage to habituate the rats to the new food. These pellets will be used as rewards throughout the training protocol.\nHabituation: Place the rats in the testing cage for 30-45 min and provide 30-50 pellets in the feeding bowl, mixed with powdered chow. Open and close the cage window and run the pellet dispenser occasionally to habituate the rats to their sound.\nRepeat this for 2-3 days.\nReward-touch: Train the rats to touch the spherical handle through the cage window and to then move to the opposite side of the cage to retrieve a food reward.",
    "Adjust the software settings so that the handle is located just outside the testing cage window at the start of each trial and align the handle with the center of the cage window. When the trials are successful, i.e., as soon as a light touch on the handle (0.25 mm displacement in any direction) has been detected, a tone sounds and a reward is dispensed. Classify trials as failed when no touch has been detected for 180 s after the window opens.\nPut the rat in the training cage. Prompt the rat to reach out by letting it grab at a pellet held near the handle. Direct the rat's attention to the handle and food bowl by tapping on the cage.\nStop prompting when the rat independently reaches through the cage window and retrieves the food pellet.\nContinue until 100 trials (touches) are completed or until 60 min have passed, whichever comes first.\nContinue training for 3-4 days and begin the next stage of training (step 2.4) when rats achieve 100 trials within 30 min on 2 consecutive days.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not over-train this step. The goal of reward-touch is to achieve reliable interaction between the rat and robot, so that this behavior can be shaped in subsequent training.\nFree pull (FP): Train the rats to reach out and pull the robot's handle.\nAdjust the software settings so that the handle is located 18 mm from the window at the start of each trial, and must be pulled for at least 10 mm without interruption for a successful trial. There are no lateral restrictions on the pulling movement in this stage.",
    "Classify a trial as failed when the handle has not been moved for 180 s after the window opens, when the handle is moved outside of the reachable workspace (more than 12 mm from midline), or when the rat has pulled less than 10 mm within 5 s after the first touch has been detected.\nTake note of the number of times the left and right paw are used during the first 20 trials of the first FP session. The paw that is used in at least 80% of the trials is considered the preferred paw.\n\t\tNOTE: Paw preference may already be clear in reward-touch sessions.\nMove the handle laterally until it is aligned with the edge of the window to facilitate pulling with the preferred paw (i.e. move the robot 5 mm to the left side of the window for right-handed rats and vice-versa).\n\t\tNOTE: Place the handle in this exact same position relative to the cage for all following training sessions for this rat. Assure exact placement by marks on the cage wall and on the robot.\nPut the rat in the training cage and train until 100 trials are completed or until 60 min have passed, whichever comes first.\n\t\tNOTE: If the rat does not reach out far enough, prompt it by letting it grab at a pellet held near the handle. Rats may stop trying to pull after repeated failed attempts. Tap on the cage, let them grab for pellets held with a pair of forceps or dispense a pellet to restore their motivation.\nFor experiments involving only FP training, continue training as described in 2.4.",
    "NOTE: Typically, 1-2 FP sessions are needed to help transition from reward touch to SP(Straight Pull) training. The goal of these FP sessions is to habituate rats to reach out, grab and pull the handle, rather than to only touch it. As with reward-touch training, it is important not to over-train if the goal is to transition to a next training step.\nStraight pull (SP): Train the rats to pull the handle without deviating more than 2 mm from midline.\n\tNOTE: The midline is defined relative to the start position of the robot, not to the midpoint of the cage window. Thus, a pulling attempt ending at the midpoint of the cage window will result in a pulling trajectory that deviates more than 2 mm from midline.\n\t\nAdjust the software settings so that only trials where the pulling movement does not deviate more than 2 mm from midline on either side are rewarded by a tone and a pellet. Keep all other parameters as described in step 2.4.\nPut the rat in the training cage and train until 100 trials are completed or until 60 min have passed, whichever comes first.\n\t\tNOTE: Rats may become extremely agitated and stop trying to pull after repeated failed attempts. Tap on the cage to redirect their attention to the reaching task, let them grab for pellets held with a pair of forceps or dispense a pellet to restore their motivation.\nContinue training until the rats reach plateau performance, or adapt the training period according to the goal of an experiment.\nSubscription Required.
