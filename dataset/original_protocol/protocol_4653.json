    "Preparation of PPA staining solution Making 4% PPA solution: Dissolve 8.0 g potassium pyroantimonate (PPA) in the 400 mM Na2HPO4 (pH 7.6) by heating to 90-95 °C and with continuous agitation. Then after, filter the solution through a 0.22 μm Millipore filter, then keep it in 4 °C refrigerator before use (see Notes 1).Making PPA staining fluid (50 ml): Mix 25 ml 4% PPA solution with 6 ml 25% Glutaraldehyde, then fill up with 19 ml of sterile H2O (see Notes 2).Fixation and rinsing: Collect plant root tips that grown on 1/2 MS medium and rinse with distilled water several times, then cut rip tips with a scalpel in size of about 2 mm and quickly put it in cold PPA staining fluid in a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube. If the plant materials are floating, give a vacuum treatment (0.8 Mpa, 10 min) till the materials sink to the bottom of tube, fixation at 4 °C, overnight. Discard PPA staining fluid, by rinsing with 1% PPA solution for 3 times, each time for 5 min.Dehydration: Then after, dehydrate the fixed material in a graded cold acetone serials (30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, 100%, 100%), and 15 min each time.Penetration: After dehydration, treat the materials with a serial mixtures of Epon 812: pure acetone (1:3, 1:1 and 3:1) for 12 h each time; and pure Epon 812 mixture (35-40 °C) for 12 h.Embed: Add fresh Epon 812 mixture to clean 200 μl Eppendorf tube, transfer root tip carefully and organize the root tip and let it merged in the embedding mixture but not touch to wall of tube with a needle (Figure 1A).",
    "Then put the tubes in an incubator, 35 °C for 12 h, then 45 °C for 12 h and 60 °C for 24 h, till the resin is well solidified. Cool down at room temperature for about 1 h. Coat nickel grids: Coat nickel grids with formvar can be done by merging the grids in formvar solution for several second then dry on filter paper for about 1 to 2 h; or put a drop of formvar solution directly on the nickel grids on a clean grass slide then let it dry down naturally, it takes about 2 h.Sectioning: After trimming the embedded block with a sharp knife (or a block trimmer) properly, cut the block with an ultra-cut microtome to generate 100 nm thick ultrathin sections and mounted onto 200-mesh formvar-coated nickel grids (Figure 1B). Dry under a lamp for about 1 h. Microscopy: Check the samples with a transmission electron microscope. Calcium deposition shows black granules or aggregates (Figure 1C-D; Notes 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160119/20160119184522_8729.jpgFigure 1. Representative pattern of sampling and calcium deposition in the root-tip cells of alfalfa. A. Illustration of sample in embedding mixture; B. Illustration of sample section on nickel grid; C. Cortical cell walls of rstB transgenic alfalfa showed large aggregates were deposited on remnants of membranes and cytoplasm. D. The epidermal cell walls of wt plant showed weak calcium staining. The deposited granules are smaller. Calcium deposition was indicated with solid red arrows. Lipid bodies (droplets) were indicated with blue dotted arrows. The scale bars represent 2 μm."
