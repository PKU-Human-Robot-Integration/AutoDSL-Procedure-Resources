    "All fish work was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California-Berkeley (protocol number R330).\n1. Prepare Nucleic Acids for Injection\nTol2 Plasmid Transgenesis (Adapted from Fisher26).\n\t\nCut 10 µg transposase plasmid (pCS-Tp)39 with 10 U NotI in supplied buffer for 1 hr at 37 °C to linearize.\n\t\tNote: Material Transfer Agreements may be required to obtain Tol2 plasmids.\nExtract the cut plasmid with a 25:24:1 mixture of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol and ethanol precipitate with sodium acetate according to standard protocols40. Resuspend plasmid in 50 µl RNase-free water.\n\t\tNote: Phenol-chloroform should be used in a hood and the waste must be properly disposed according to institutional guidelines.\nSet up a Sp6 transcription reaction according to manufacturer's instructions.\nUse a RNA isolation kit to clean up transcription reaction according to manufacturer's instructions; resuspend RNA in 50 µL RNase-free water.\nRemove a 1 µl aliquot of RNA. Heat to 65 °C for 5 min to denature secondary structures then immediately chill on ice. Freeze remaining transcription reaction at -80 °C.\nRun the RNA aliquot on a 1% agarose gel in 0.5x TAE (Tris base, Acetic acid, Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) running buffer with an RNA size standard in one lane. The expected product is 2,200 bp; discard if >5% of the total RNA appears in a smear smaller than 2,200 bp, which indicates extensive degradation (Figure 1).\nQuantify RNA using a spectrophotometer at 260 nm. Dilute to 350 ng/µl in RNase-free water and store 1 µl aliquots at -80 °C (good for at least two years).",
    "Clone Tol2 reporter plasmid (for example, using pT2HE8 or plasmids from the Tol2 kit41) with cis-regulatory element of interest. Briefly, PCR amplify a genomic DNA sequence of interest with primers containing restriction sites found in the plasmid, digest the PCR product and vector with the enzyme(s), ligate the insert into the vector, and transform resulting plasmid into competent E. coli40. Isolate plasmid with a kit that includes an endotoxin rinse according to manufacturer's protocol.\nPerform a second purification of the Tol2 plasmid with a PCR purification kit according to manufacturer's protocol. Elute in 30 µl RNase-free water.\n\t\tNote: the yield from this step may be low (sometimes under 50% of the input plasmid).\nDilute plasmid to ~125 ng/µl in RNase-free water.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54055/54055fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Transposase mRNA gel. Purified transcription reaction product (1 µl) was heated to 65 °C, chilled on ice, and run on a 1% agarose gel with 0.5x TAE running buffer at 100 V. The sizes of the RNA ladder in kilobases (kb) are indicated to the left. The full length transposase mRNA is a bright band at ~2.2 kb. A small but acceptable amount of degraded or incomplete mRNA is seen below 2.2 kb.

Use ethanol precipitation to recover DNA with a standard sodium acetate-ethanol extraction40 and resuspend DNA at ~250 ng/µl in RNase-free water.\nPrepare transposase mRNA as in section 1.1.\nMutation Induction with TALENs (See Cermak35 for Design of TALENs)\n\t\nUse the web-based application to design TALENs for the gene of interest42. If possible, design TALENs to disrupt a restriction enzyme cut site to facilitate molecular analysis.",
    "Clone TALENs and prepare plasmids for transcription following published protocol35.\nTranscribe TALEN mRNA with a Sp6 transcription reaction according to manufacturer's instructions and clean up mRNA as described for transposase in section 1.1.4. Quantify with a spectrophotometer and dilute to 200 ng/µl in RNase free water. Run TALEN mRNA on a gel to ensure it is the proper size and not degraded as described in step 1.1.6.\nDesign a pair of PCR primers to amplify approximately 100-200 bp surrounding the TALEN target sequence using a primer design tool and the target DNA sequence43. Order the appropriate restriction enzyme to test for lesions at the target site based on step 1.3.1.\nCRISPR Transgenesis (See Talbot and Amacher38 for Design and Preparation of CRISPRs):\n\t\nDesign and prepare CRISPRs and Cas9 mRNA according to protocol38, and order appropriate verification primers and restriction enzymes as described in step 1.3.4.\n2. Prepare Injection Reagents\nUse Borosilicate Capillaries to Prepare Needles as Described Below.\n\tNote: these capillaries are not the standard capillaries used for zebrafish microinjection, and are made of a thicker and stronger glass that is critical to puncture the tough stickleback chorion.\n\t\nAlways wear nitrile or latex gloves when pulling needles, and do not allow needles to contact skin or skin oils.\nDetermine micropipette pulling parameters empirically by ramp tests following the micropipette puller's manufacturer's instructions. For example, with a box filament, the following parameters were determined to be optimal: (Heat = 515, Pull = 60, Velocity = 60, Delay = 85, Pressure = 500). These settings produce a needle that tapers steeply at approximately 12° for ~2 mm and then a long extension that tapers at approximately 2° for ~6 mm (Figure 2).",
    "Note: The proper parameters will vary by puller and filament, and blindly using a program without determining the parameters first through ramp tests can permanently destroy the puller's filament, which is difficult and expensive to replace.\nFollow manufacturer's instructions to pull at least 4 micropipette needles from borosilicate glass with the settings determined in 2.1.2.\nStore needles vertically in capillary storage jar with the sharp end facing down.\nBefore injecting, place capillary storage jar on ice to chill needles. Add a piece of moist paper towel to the jar to prevent evaporation once the needles are filled.\nFertilize Eggs (All Steps Performed at RT)\n\t\nStrip egg clutch from gravid female stickleback by gently squeezing the abdomen and stroking in an anterior to posterior direction to push the eggs out through the cloaca and into a 35 x 10 mm2 Petri dish. Add a moist piece of paper towel on one side of the Petri dish (not touching the eggs) to create humidity chamber. Place lid on Petri dish so eggs stay moist.\nEuthanize male stickleback in 0.025% Tricaine-S buffered with 0.1% sodium bicarbonate.\nCut open the abdomen, remove testes and macerate in 250 µl Hank's solution (see Westerfield44 for full protocol for Hank's solution preparation).\nFertilize at most 100 eggs with 50 µl sperm solution and gently stir with pipette tip to ensure all eggs are fertilized. If the clutch is >100 eggs, fertilize half of the eggs later to ensure that all embryos are at a one-cell stage at the time of injection. Eggs can be left unfertilized at RT for up to an hour, and sperm generally lasts for 1-7 days at 4 °C in Hank's solution.",
    "Keep embryos covered with Petri dish lid after fertilization to prevent drying. Allow 20-25 min for the first cell to emerge and swell up (prepare injection materials during this time).\nFill a 150 mm x 15 mm Petri dish with stickleback water. (To make stickleback water, first prepare 10% sodium bicarbonate dissolved in deionized water. Then add 3.5 g artificial seawater mix and 0.217 ml of 10% sodium bicarbonate per 1 L of deionized water, and stir/shake vigorously to dissolve salt.)\nPrepare Injection Solution (While Eggs are Fertilizing)\n\t\nPrepare injection solution according to Table 1 and store on ice.\n\t\tNote: the concentrations of some nucleic acids have been increased from those published for zebrafish due to the increased volume of the stickleback blastomere.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4\nReagent,Tol2 injection,BAC injection,TALEN injection,CRISPR injection\nTol2 mRNA,350 ng,350 ng,-,-\nDNA,150-200 ng plasmid,200-300 ng BAC,-,-\nTALEN mRNA,-,-,200 ng each,-\nCRISPR guide RNA,-,-,-,200 ng\nCas9 mRNA,-,-,-,400 ng\n0.5% phenol red inDulbecco's PBS,0.5 µl,0.5 µl,0.5 µl,0.5 µl\nRNAse free water,to 5 µl,to 5 µl,to 5 µl,to 5 µl\nTable 1: Injection reagents. All mixtures should be prepared to a total volume on 5 µl and stored on ice.\nFill Needles (On Ice; Allow At Least 10 Min for Needles to Fill).\n\t\nBackfill at least three needles by pipetting 0.5 µl injection solution onto the blunt top end of the needle while needles are hanging vertically in capillary storage jar. Be careful that the drop stays on top and does not drip down the side and avoid bubbles.\nAfter the red liquid has mostly drained to the pointed tip of the needle, add another 0.5 µl to the blunt end of the needle and allow it to drain.\n3. Prepare Inject Rig and Needle for Microinjection\nNote: These steps can usually be done after fertilizing the eggs.",
    "Turn on transillumination light for the dissecting microscope and place a ~13 cm x 13 cm glass plate on the microscope light base with 15 cm plaster saw blade on top of the glass plate7. Orient the saw perpendicular to the injection apparatus with the indentations facing towards the needle holder.\nTurn on air supply and ensure pressure is set to ~200 kPa from the regulator.\nTurn on the control box and adjust settings. Set pressure to ~150-175 kPa. Set injection duration to 180 msec.\nLoosen the needle holder, insert a filled needle into the holder until resistance of the rubber holder can be felt, and tighten until finger tight.\nAdjust the needle angle to approximately 45°.\nUse micromanipulator controls to adjust the needle so the end is centered in the field of view. Zoom in to ~40X magnification and focus on the tip of the needle, which should not be touching the glass below.\nGently break the tip of the needle by grasping it with watchmaker's forceps. Ideally, do not break perpendicularly, but rather at a ~60° angle. Break close to the tip (not more than 2-3 forceps widths away from the end, Figure 2).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54055/54055fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Unbroken and broken microinjection needles. The top needle is unbroken and the tip of the bottom needle has been broken with forceps (arrow). Needles are filled with a solution containing 0.05% phenol red. Scale bar = 1 mm. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54055/54055fig2large.jpg]\nPress the injection foot pedal several times to test whether the needle is broken. After a few taps, tiny red droplets should begin to come out of the end. If not, try breaking the needle slightly higher.",
    "If the needle has an air bubble, increase the back pressure unit and press the pedal several times quickly to work the bubble out.\nAdjust the Back Pressure:\n\t\nUse the disposable transfer pipette to place a few drops of stickleback water on the glass plate.\nGently lower the needle into the water.\nIncrease the back pressure until a faint stream of pink liquid emerges from the needle (indicating positive pressure).\n\t\tNote: If there is not enough back pressure, the needle will draw up the cytoplasm by capillary action. If there is too much back pressure, the injection volume may be inadvertently too large.\nRetract the needle as far as possible so that it will not be damaged while preparing the embryos (see below).\nAlternatively, adjust the back pressure to a higher pressure setting so that a constant strong stream of liquid exits the needle when it is submerged in water. Then, pressing the foot pedal to inject becomes unnecessary; however, the injection must be performed quickly to avoid over-injecting.\n\tNote: Do not attempt this technique when first learning to inject.\n4. Microinjection\nAbout 25 min after fertilization, use two 10 µl pipet tips to remove 5-10 embryos from the clutch and transfer to the glass plate.\nStill using the pipet tips, gently separate the embryos into individual indentations of the saw blade. Use caution not to puncture embryos.\nUsing a transfer pipet with end cut off so stickleback embryos will fit inside, add enough stickleback water to cover the embryos, leave the water on for 3-5 sec, then remove the excess water with the pipet, leaving a small volume of water coating each embryo.",
    "Note: Too much water will cause the chorions to harden and break the needle, but a small volume of water is necessary to lift the chorion away from the cell and yolk (Figure 3A-B).\nStarting with the embryo furthest away, slide the glass plate and zoom in so that the first embryo fills approximately 25% of the field of vision.\nLower the needle into the field of vision, then use the 10 µl pipet tip to gently rotate the embryo to identify the blastomere, a grainy, slightly yellow raised bump of cytoplasm on top of the yolk (Figure 3B), and then rotate so that the blastomere is directly perpendicular to the end of the needle (while keeping the embryo in the indentation of the saw blade, Figure 3C).\n\tNote: the yolk droplets may move as the embryo is rotated, so do not use them as a frame of reference for the location of the blastomere.\nLower the needle into the cytoplasm but do not push through to the underlying yolk. Apply pressure slowly and evenly when piercing the chorion to avoid breaking the needle. If the needle bends severely, retract and try again in a slightly different location.\nDepress the foot pedal 3-4 times to inject so that a red bolus with slightly diffuse edges fills about ~1/8 the diameter of the cytoplasm (see Figure 3D).\n\t\nAvoid obtaining a red bolus with sharp edges that do not begin to diffuse, which indicates injection into the yolk beneath the cytoplasm (Figure 3E).\nIf a bright pinkish-red spot diffuses quickly, insert the needle further to puncture the blastomere.\nIf the injection bolus turns yellow instantly, rotate the embryo to ensure the blastomere has been targeted and inject again (Figure 3F).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54055/54055fig3.jpg",
    "Figure 3. Appearance of stickleback embryos before and after injection. All embryos are drawn from the perspective of looking down through the microscope (except for C' and G). (A) Before adding water, fertilized embryos have a uniform appearance with oil droplets floating near the top of the yolk. (B) After adding water, the chorion swells, revealing a blastomere that protrudes from the yolk and is visible in profile. (C) Rotation of the embryo so that the needle enters perpendicularly to the chorion and blastomere. (C') Lateral view of a needle that has punctured the chorion with the tip in the cytoplasm. (D) Injection into the cytoplasm results in a red spot with diffuse edges that fade over time. (E) Injection into the yolk underlying the cytoplasm results in a red spot with defined edges.

    "Keep ~10% of embryos as uninjected controls to ensure that uninjected embryos develop normally and to use as wild-type controls for the molecular assays described below.\n5. Post Injection Care\nIncubate embryos in Petri dishes at 18 °C after injection until hatching10. Following hatching, rear larvae in aquaria as described10.\nGently pour off the stickleback water one day after injection and replace with fresh stickleback water. Replace with fresh stickleback water at least every other day after that.\nCheck for dead or malformed embryos daily. Remove such embryos to prevent decay from contaminating the water.\n6. Analysis of Injection Results\nFor injection of fluorescent reporters, monitor embryos daily in a darkened room using a fluorescent dissecting microscope with a GFP or RFP filter (depending on fluorescent transgene). Record anatomical patterns of gene expression with digital photographs and/or written descriptions and tabulation of the number of fish with different expression domains (Figures 4 and 5).\n\tNote: Sticklebacks have autofluorescent, stellate pigment cells that are visible under GFP filters beginning at 4 days post fertilization (dpf).\n\t\nTo generate stable lines, save embryos with detectable fluorescence and grow to adulthood as described10.\nOutcross injected adult fish to wild-type fish using the in vitro fertilization procedure described in section 2.2 and screen offspring for fluorescence as described in step 6.1 to look for fluorescent offspring, indicating successful transgene transmission.\nTo visualize fluorescence in hatched, free-swimming larvae, add 500 µl 0.8% Tricaine to the 150 mm Petri dish to anaesthetize fish and wait until fish stop moving to image. Immediately rinse several times with fresh stickleback water following observation and imaging.",
    "Optionally, to preserve fluorescence for further imaging, euthanize larvae in 0.025% (250 mg/L) Tricaine buffered with 0.1% sodium bicarbonate and fix for 4 hr in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1x Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) at 4 °C. Store in 1x PBS for up to two weeks.\n\t\tNote: background auto-fluorescence increases over time.\nDiagnostic PCR/digestion Genotyping for Mutation Induction with CRISPRs or TALENs -- Best Performed at 2 days Post Fertilization.\n\t\nUse a transfer pipet to place 10 injected embryos (2 dpf, still in chorions) into the first 10 wells of a 12-well PCR strip tube. Place uninjected control fish in the last two wells.\nRemove excess stickleback water.\nAdd 50 µl lysis buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.3% Tween-20, and 0.3% NP-40) to each well.\nPlace caps on tubes and incubate at 95 °C for 20 min in a thermocycler.\n\t\tNote: The yolk will turn white and rubbery after the boiling step.\nRemove lids and use a different clean 1,000 µl pipet tip to macerate the embryo in each tube.\n\t\tNote: White debris will collect at the bottom of the tube.\nAdd 2.5 µl of 10 mg/ml proteinase K to each well.\nReplace lids and incubate at 55 °C for 1 hr to digest protein, followed by 95 °C for 20 min to inactivate proteinase K. Store at -20 °C to avoid mold growth.\nPerform PCR using a high-fidelity polymerase following manufacturer's instructions. Use the embryo lysate as DNA template.\n\t\tNote: Be careful to remove liquid from top of tube for DNA template, avoiding any visible chorion or yolk debris at the bottom of the tube.",
    "Mix the PCR product in equal volume with a restriction enzyme master mix containing 1x enzyme-specific buffer and 0.25 µl enzyme per sample. Always save half of the uncut PCR product to assay on a gel to confirm PCR products are the predicted size. Incubate the PCR mixed with enzyme at the appropriate conditions for the restriction enzyme.\n\t\tNote: Some enzymes may require other ratios of enzyme buffer to PCR product; adjust the buffer concentration if the uninjected controls do not show complete digestion.\nFollowing digestion, run products on a 1% agarose gel next to a DNA size ladder to confirm expected product sizes.\n\t\tNote: Uncut bands in injected embryos indicate the presence of molecular lesions (Figure 6) and uninjected controls must be fully digested to interpret results.\nTo confirm lesions, cut out uncut bands from agarose gels and purify DNA with a gel extraction kit. Use Sanger sequencing, ideally using a sequencing primer internal to the PCR primers, to confirm lesions. In F0 injected embryos, a mix of lesions will likely be present, causing the quality of the Sanger read to degrade near the target site.\nTo produce a stable line, save all injected embryos from clutches that screen positive for molecular lesions. Grow up fish, outcross, and then screen a subset of F1 embryos for molecular lesions as described in steps 6.2.1 through 6.2.11. If heterozygous carriers are identified, grow the remaining F1 embryos to adulthood and identify heterozygous individuals using DNA extracted from a caudal fin clip.\nSubscription Required.
