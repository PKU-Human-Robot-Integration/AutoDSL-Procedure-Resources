    "This protocol follows the ethical guidelines of our institution. In accordance with the statutes of our institution's ethical review committee no ethical approval had to be obtained prior to the experiments, as all porcine corneas were obtained from the local slaughterhouse.\n1. Organ culture\nPrepare pig eyes.\n\t\nFrom the local slaughterhouse, obtain pig eyes that were removed shortly postmortem but before thermal treatment. Transport the eyes to the lab and process them within a few hours. During transport, keep the eyes at room temperature (approximately 21 °C) before processing.\nRemove all orbital adnexes (eye muscles, conjunctiva, adipose tissue) prior to disinfection using eye scissors and colibri forceps. Separate and discard all eyes with obvious trauma, external damage (e.g., knife cut), or visible corneal opacities.\nPrepare a 5% iodine-PBS-solution (1:20) in a sterile cup by adding 3 mL of 7.5% povidone iodine to 57 mL of a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution. Also prepare a separate sterile cup containing 60 mL pure PBS.\n\t\tNOTE: The total amount of used iodine-PBS-solution and the size of the cup depends on the number of corneas to be dissected. Five to six eyes require approximately 60 mL of the 5%-iodine-PBS-solution to be disinfected properly.\nPut five to six eyes into the 5%-iodine-PBS solution for a total of 5 min to properly disinfect the eyes' surface. Carefully stir every minute to ensure the eyes' surface is fully submerged and disinfected completely in the iodine solution.\nAfter 5 min, transfer the disinfected eyes to the prepared cup filled with pure PBS. Again, carefully stir to ensure the iodine-PBS-solution is washed away from the eyes' surface.\n\t\tNOTE: Perform this step on a clean bench to prevent contamination of the disinfected eyes.\nPrepare cell culture plates.",
    "NOTE: Perform the following steps on a clean bench with constant laminar air flow.\n\t\nThaw 2 mL of fetal calf serum (FCS). Fill a syringe (5 mL) with the FCS using a blunt cannula. Empty the syringe through a syringe filter (0.22 µm) to prevent possible bacterial contaminationof the FCS into 80 mL of dextran-free culture medium I (minimum essential medium [MEM] with Earle's salts, penicillin/streptomycin, L-glutamine [200 mM], amphotericin B [250 µg/mL], Hepes buffer [1 M] [50x], NaHCO3, and distilled water). Agitate the mixture to ensure even substrate distribution.\nFill each well of a 12 well cell culture plate with 3 mL of the substrate mixture.\nPerform dissection and incubation.\n\tNOTE: Perform this step on a clean bench. Do not touch the corneal endothelium with any instruments.\n\t\nTransfer an eye bulb from the cup with PBS into the eye bulb holder with the cornea facing up and place it beneath an ophthalmic surgical microscope. Use a syringe filled with 0.9% NaCl to slightly apply some suction to the eye over the eye bulb holder to fixate the eye in position for dissection.\nUse a trephine (ø 7.5 mm) containing a standardized inlay, which ensures the trephined depth will not exceed 300 µm, to cut superficially into the central cornea (Figure 1A).\nUse colibri forceps and a single-use scalpel with a triangular blade to cut and remove the partially trephined part of the cornea horizontally through the stroma. Discard the separated corneal part consisting of the corneal epithelium, the bowman layer, and a part of the stroma.\n\t\tNOTE: Strictly maintain the horizontal cutting direction to obtain an even thickness of the remaining stroma.",
    "Superficially place a 10-0 suture (10-0 polyamide 6) into the stroma to be able to differentiate the endothelial from the stromal side during the experiments (Figure 1B). Prevent penetration of the corneal endothelium. Discard the eye bulb if the endothelium is penetrated.\n\t\tNOTE: Penetration of the corneal endothelium with the suturing needle will be visible, as fluid from the anterior eye chamber will leak through the suture channel.\nUse the trephine without the inlay to advance the trephined cut to full depth until the anterior eye chamber is reached (Figure 1C). A distinct drop in resistance and fluid leaking from the anterior eye chamber can be perceived after complete penetration of the cornea.\n\t\tNOTE: Use a hockey knife if the split corneal button remains attached on one side of the split corneal button after trephination.\nTransfer the obtained split corneal button, now consisting of a part of the stroma (Figure 2), the Descemet's membrane, and the corneal endothelium, into the culture medium (culture medium I + FCS, see section 1.2) into the 12 well cell culture plate with the tagged side facing down, so that the corneal endothelium is facing up.\n\t\tNOTE: If the endothelial side is facing down, the endothelium may get damaged.\nAssign an individual number to every split corneal button for identification during the follow ups and label the wells on the cell culture plate accordingly.\nIncubate the filled cell culture plates in an incubator under standard conditions at a temperature of 37 °C, 5% CO2 and a relative air moisture of 95%. Change the culture medium (culture medium I + FCS) on day 8 if an incubation period of 7 days is exceeded.\n\t\tNOTE: The incubation procedure using split corneal buttons has been validated for up to 15 days.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60171/60171fig1.jpg",

Microscopy and examination of the endothelium\nPerform unstained examination.\n\tNOTE: Unstained examination can be performed multiple times (e.g., at weekly follow ups on day 1, 8, and 15). However, unstained counting only allows the assessment of endothelial cell density, not morphological parameters.\n\t\nFill 3 mL of hypotonic balanced salt solution (hBSS, see composition in Table of Materials) in each well of a 12 well cell culture plate. Carefully place a single split corneal button in hBSS to induce swelling of the corneal endothelial cells and improve visibility of the cells for cell counting.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure that the endothelial side is facing the direction of the microscope. If an inverted phase contrast microscope is used, the endothelial side needs to be facing downwards. While in place, the culture plate should not be moved to prevent endothelial cell damage.",
    "Let the cells swell for 1-2 min before taking a picture of the endothelium with the camera attached to the microscope. Take at least three photographs of at least three different areas in order to obtain a representative impression of the actual condition of the corneal endothelium. Add a scale bar with the true to scale length of 100 µm for later analysis of the corneal endothelial cell density and morphological parameters.\nTo prevent osmotic damage, remove the split corneal button from the hBSS after a maximum of 5 min and transfer it back into the culture medium3.\nPerform stained examination.\n\tNOTE: Staining terminates the experiments, as the staining substances used are cytotoxic. Therefore, staining may only be performed at the end of the observation period for the assessment of morphological parameters (reformation figures, rosette formations, alizarin red stained cells).\n\t\nPrepare a 0.25% trypan blue solution and 0.2% alizarin red S solution for the staining procedure.\n\t\t\nFor the 0.25% trypan blue solution, dilute the 0.4% trypan blue solution with a 0.9% NaCl solution.\n\t\t\tNOTE: For example, to obtain 20 mL of a 0.25% trypan blue solution, dilute 12.5 mL of the 0.4% trypan blue solution with 7.5 mL of the 0.9% NaCl solution. The trypan blue solution may be stored at room temperature for several weeks or months.\nTo obtain a 0.2% alizarin red S solution dissolve 100 mg of the alizarin red S powder in 50 mL of a 0.9% NaCl solution under constant stirring and heating to 50 °C on a magnet stirring plate with heating function. To remove possible precipitates, filter the obtained solution. Adjust the pH of alizarin red S solution to pH 4.2 by adding sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid accordingly.",
    "NOTE: Before each application of the alizarin red S solution make sure the pH is corrected to 4.2 and that there are no precipitates in the solution. The solution may be stored at room temperature. Do not store the solution for longer than 4 weeks.\nPlace the split corneal buttons in Petri dishes with the endothelial side facing upwards in order to stain the endothelial cells. Use a pipette to slowly drip the 0.25% trypan blue solution drop by drop onto the corneal endothelium for 90 s.\n\t\tNOTE: Trypan blue allows identification of damaged corneal cells with a permeable membrane because it stains their nuclei.\nCarefully rinse the split corneal button 3x in 0.9% NaCl in a small glass beaker. Again, use a pipette to slowly drip the 0.2% alizarin red S solution drop by drop onto the corneal endothelium for 90 s.\n\t\tNOTE: Alizarin red S stains the Descemet's membrane, which helps to highlight cell borders in undamaged corneal endothelial cells and to highlight destroyed cells when the underlying Descemet's membrane becomes visible. Also, it enables easy identification of larger destroyed areas.\nFor examination of the stained corneal endothelium follow the steps explained for unstained counting in section 2.1.\n3. Analysis of the corneal endothelial cell density and morphological parameters\nProject counting squares on the pictures using a graphics editing software (Table of Materials).\n\t\nOpen the software and open an image of the corneal endothelium by selecting File | Open | Select.\nProject a square with a true to scale side length of 100 µm on the image.",
    "NOTE: The following steps of section 3.1.2 can be ignored if the viewing software allows for the projecting of counting squares onto the picture. The side length of the square depends on the resolution of the images taken with the microscope's camera and can be calculated with the scale bar.\n\t\t\nCrop the scale bar from the photograph taken with the microscope: select the Rectangular Marquee Tool on the tool bar or press M, then border the scale bar, then select Edit | Crop or press Ctrl + X.\nClick File | New (or press Ctrl + N). On the upcoming window select Clipboard in the Document Type drop-down list. The number of pixels shown is the side length of the counting square. Note the corresponding pixels for the other pictures and click OK.\nSelect File | New (or Ctrl + N). Insert width and length (in pixels) of the counting square in the upcoming window according to the length of the scale bar. Select background color White, then press OK.\nClick Select | Select all (or Ctrl + A). Select Edit | Copy (or Ctrl + C).\nSelect the image of the corneal endothelium opened in step 3.1.1. Select Edit | Paste (or Ctrl + V) to insert the square on the photo of the corneal endothelium.\nSelect the square's layer and adjust the transparency. Select Layer | Layer Style | Blending Options | Set Opacity to 30% | OK.\nSave the image with the projected square with a true to scale side length of 100 µm. Repeat with the other pictures needed for analysis.\nAssess the endothelial cell density and morphological parameters.",
    "Open the images with the projected squares in ImageJ (Version 1.50i) and use the CellCounter PlugIn to count the cells within the square. Open ImageJ, select File | Open (or Ctrl + O) | Select Image.\n\t\tNOTE: ImageJ and the CellCounter PlugIn are freeware available for download online.\nSelect Plugins | Cell_Counter | Cell Counter | Initialize. Count the endothelial cells and record the result. On two sides of the square, count the cells that are cut by the square's edge. Do not count cut cells on the other two sides.\nAnalyze at least six squares per cornea from different areas (e.g., three pictures, two squares per picture) and determine the average corneal endothelial cell density per square (100 µm2). Extrapolate the endothelial cell density per 100 µm2 to 1 mm2 by multiplying by 100.\nFor the assessment of morphological changes, count reformation figures (joint meeting of ≥4 cells/cell borders instead of three), rosette formations (characteristic rosette-shaped appearance, five or more radially arranged cells surrounding a destroyed cell), or alizarin red areas (destroyed cells) in the projected squares.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, it may be useful to use larger squares (e.g., 200 x 200 µm2) for morphological analysis in well-preserved samples to obtain more representative results.\nSubscription Required.
