    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTiming: 2–3 days\nPreparation of oxidized and reduced controls\nTiming: 2–4 h\nGrind frozen biological material and aliquot equal amount (e.g., 20 mg) for each sample in 1.5 ml tubes.\nAdd 90 μL lysis buffer, vortex mix and incubate onto ice for 15 min.\nCentrifuge at maximum speed for 15 min then transfer the supernatant into new tube.\nFor preparing oxidized control, add 10 μL CuCl2 (from 10× stock of 300 μM) into 90 μL protein extract to a final concentration of 30 μM and incubate at 37°C for 30 min. Caution: CuCl2 is considered hazardous by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Hazard Communication Standard.\nFor preparing reduced control, add 10 μL DTT (from 10× stock of 400 mM) into 90 μL protein extract to a final concentration of 40 mM and incubate at 37°C for 75 min.\nPause Point: oxidized and reduced samples can be stored at −20°C.\nProtein extraction and conjugation with MM(PEG)24\nTiming: 3–4 h\nThis step involves extraction of protein from biological materials and conjugation of reduced protein cysteine thiols with MM(PEG)24. Addition of cold TCA into frozen biological materials denatures and precipitates proteins. It quenches the thiol oxidation, and native redox state of cysteine thiol is preserved (Hansen et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Treatment of proteins with MM(PEG)24 adds a molecule of MM(PEG)24 to each reduced cysteine thiol thereby increasing the molecular weight of the protein by 1.24 kDa for each molecule added. This increased molecular weight of the protein is the basis of determination of reduced state of protein cysteine thiols.\nGrind biological materials in liquid nitrogen and aliquot 20 mg each in 1.5 mL tubes. The amount of biological material can be optimized based on protein expression levels.",
    "Add 1 mL of cold 10% (v/v) TCA to samples, and to the oxidized and reduced controls. Mix immediately by vortexing.\nIncubate in ice for 30 min.\nCentrifuge at 16,000 g at 4°C for 10 min.\nWash and dry the pellets. Add 1 mL of cold 90% acetone, vortex mix, centrifuge at 11000 g for 5 min and remove the supernatant. Repeat the wash with 1 mL of cold 100% acetone. Dry the pellet at 37°C for 5 min. Do not over dry.\nResuspend the pellets in 90 μL of resuspension buffer. Add 10 μL of 10 mM MM(PEG)24. Resuspension buffer contains SDS that will denature proteins exposing cysteine thiols.\nIncubate at 65°C for 5 min and then at 22°C to 25°C for 1 h for protein thiol alkylation. Incubation at 65°C will help to denature the proteins exposing the cysteine thiols. Reaction with MM(PEG)24 results in formation of stable, irreversible thioether bond with cysteine thiols.\nPause Point: samples can be stored at 4°C for about a week. It is better to run as fresh as possible.\nRunning non-reducing SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate)-PAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and western blot analysis\nTiming: 7–20 h\nThis step accomplishes the fractionation of proteins by SDS-PAGE, the transfer of proteins into a membrane, imaging and data analysis. Detection of increased molecular weight determines the cysteine thiol reduced state of protein.\nRunning non-reducing SDS-PAGE\nTiming: 1.5–2 h\nLoad gels in the gel-tank and fill it with running buffer.\nLoad equal amount (10–40 μL) of each sample into well.\nRun the gel at 120 V until the bromophenol dye reaches to the bottom of the gel.\nTake out the gel from gel tank, rinse the cassette with sterile distilled water, open the gel-cassette and put the gel in a tray with 1× transfer buffer.",
    "Transferring protein from the gel into the membrane using semi-dry transfer cell\nTiming: 1–2 h\nSoak two extra thick blotting papers and one nitrocellulose membrane (similar to the size of gel) in the transfer buffer.\nIn semi-dry transfer cell, assemble the transfer sandwich in the following order: blotting paper, membrane, gel, and blotting paper. Remove any air bubbles and make sure no air bubbles are trapped in the layers. Alternatively, wet transfer system can be used.\nTransfer at 15–25 V for 30–40 min for midi-gels for proteins of 25 kDa to 150 kDa.\nGel blot conditions for trans-blot semidry system can be optimized as follows.\nFor midi gels: 15V–25V/3 mA/cm2 for 30–40 min. For large gels: 15–25 V/ 3 mA/cm2 for 60 min. We used extra thick absorbent blotting paper on both side because of its higher buffer absorbing capacity. Setting up a test run to determine the time for complete protein transfer will be helpful if the settings suggested here do not work. Protein transfer from gel to membrane may take from 10 min to 16 h depending on the power settings, gel percentage, and size of the protein. Transfer of high molecular weight protein will need longer time and vice-a-versa. Check if the marker proteins are transferred well to determine the complete transfer of target protein.\nProtein hybridization with antibody\nTiming: 4–16 h\nRinse the membrane with TBS-T. Block the membrane with 5% skimmed milk in TBS-T for 1 h at 22°C to 25°C with gentle shaking.",
    "Rinse the membrane with TBS-T. Incubate with the primary antibody against the target protein in 1% skimmed milk in TBS-T at 4°C for 12 to 16 h or at 22°C to 25°C for 1 h. We used anti-HA antibody for TRXL1-HA protein at 1:10000 dilution in 1% skimmed milk in TBS-T. TRXL1[href=https://www.arabidopsis.org/servlets/TairObject?type=locus&name=At1g76080] is a thioredoxin like chloroplastic drought induced stress protein (CDSP32) encoded by At1g76080[href=https://www.arabidopsis.org/servlets/TairObject?type=locus&name=At1g76080].\nWash the membrane 3–4 times for 15 min each with TBS-T with gentle shaking.\nIncubate with HRP conjugated secondary antibody at 22°C to 25°C for 1 h. We used Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG H&L at 1:20000 dilution in 1% skimmed milk in TBS-T.\nNote: Choose your secondary antibody based on the source of primary antibody. Our antibody was developed in rabbit, so we used anti-rabbit antibody.\nWash the membrane 3–4 times for 15 min each with TBS-T.\nImaging and data analysis\nTiming: 1 h\nPrepare the ECL western blotting detection reagent by mixing equal amount of solution A and B provided by the manufacturer[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0011536_Pierce_ECL_West_Blot_Subs_UG.pdf&title=VXNlciBHdWlkZTogIFBpZXJjZSBFQ0wgV2VzdGVybiBCbG90dGluZyBTdWJzdHJhdGU=]. Approximately 2–3 mL solution is required for a membrane of 12 cm × 6 cm.\nRemove excess buffer from membrane, do not let it dry. Place membrane in tray, apply ECL solution, and incubate at 22°C to 25°C for 0.5–5 min.\nRemove excess ECL solution.\nKeep membrane inside plastic wrap inside X-ray film cassette. Expose membrane to the X-ray film in cassette in dark room for few seconds to hours depending the signal intensity.\nDevelop the x-ray film. We developed with the help of Konica medical film processor using E-Z Store & Pour fixer and E-Z Store & Pour developer. Alternatively, manual processing can be done.",
    "Measure the band intensity using image analysis software such as ImageJ (Rueden et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). Normalize the band intensity with a housekeeping protein like Actin. Calculate the relative intensity of bands compared to a control.\nLoading control\nThe same membrane is stripped and re-probed with housekeeping protein antibody. We used anti-Actin antibody to detect Actin as loading control as it is a housekeeping protein.\nIncubate membrane in stripping buffer at 50°C for 30 min with gentle shaking. Wash the membrane with TBS-T three times every 15 min.\nReprobe with primary antibody against Actin as explained above from step # 20 to 29."
