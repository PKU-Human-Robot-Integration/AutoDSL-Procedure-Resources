    "The basic steps for isolation and purification of primary myoblasts from hind limb muscle of mice are presented in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170425/20170425192739_9755.jpgFigure 1. The schematic view of general procedures for the isolation of primary myoblasts from hind limb muscle of mice. MGM, myoblast growth medium; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; DM, differentiation medium.Before isolation of primary myoblastsAutoclave two sets of tools in sterilization pouches each containing one small pair of scissors and forceps (see Notes 1 and 2).Following Recipe 1, prepare 70% ethanol.Following Recipe 2, prepare 10% Matrigel (see Note 3).Following Recipe 3, prepare collagenase II (see Note 4).Following Recipe 4, prepare base of digestion medium (see Notes 5 and 6).Following Recipe 5, prepare collection/washing/mincing solution.Following Recipe 6, prepare neutralization/isolation medium (see Note 5).Following Recipe 8, prepare myoblast growth medium (MGM) (see Note 5).Coat 100 x 20 mm Petri dishes (one plate per mouse) by pouring and spreading 10% Matrigel solution enough to cover the plate area. Avoid bubbles. After 30 sec, remove excess Matrigel solution (excess 10% Matrigel can be collected and stored for re-use multiple times, if kept sterile). Leave the plate without cap to dry in sterile air flow in a biosafety cabinet (~20 min). Once dried, put lid on the plate and leave in sterile biosafety cabinet at room temperature until ready to use. There is no need to turn on UV light of biosafety cabinet. This plate will be used for isolation and culturing of myoblasts following digestion of muscle with collagenase. For muscle collection and washing before digestion, prepare a 6-well plate containing 3 ml/well of collection/washing/mincing solution (only 4 wells of a 6-well plate needed per mouse).For muscle mincing following isolation, prepare two 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes per mouse each containing 500 µl of collection/washing/mincing solution.",
    "Muscle removal and washingEuthanize mouse following approved IACUC guidelines in your laboratory. For purpose of this protocol, the mouse was given intraperitoneal injection of 2,2,2-tribromoethanol at a dose of 250 mg/kg, followed by cervical dislocation. The isolation of hind limb muscles from mice is performed outside a biosafety cabinet. For this step, no sterile techniques are necessary except autoclaved dissection tools and spray of ethanol. Spray hind-limbs with 70% ethanol and pin the mouse face up.Remove skin using autoclaved scissors from both hind-limbs to expose muscles.Using the first pair of autoclaved scissors and forceps, collect tibial anterior, gastrocnemius, soleus, quadriceps and extensor digitorum longus muscles from one hind-limb and place them into one well of 6-well plate containing collection/washing/mincing solution (Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Isolation of hind limb muscles from mouse. This video shows basic steps for isolation of hind limb muscles from euthanized mouse and transferring them into a 6-well plate containing collection/washing/mincing solution.Repeat the previous step on the other hind limb and place the muscles in the second well of 6-well plate containing collection/washing/mincing solution (see Note 9).Transfer the muscles using the second pair of autoclaved forceps to the other two wells of the 6-well plate filled with collection/washing/mincing solution. This is needed to wash and remove any sticking hair or unwanted tissue on isolated muscles.Put the lid on the 6-well plate containing muscle and collection/washing/mincing solution and spray with 70% ethanol before transferring the plate to a sterile biosafety cabinet. From this step onwards, all the procedure must be performed in biosafety cabinet to avoid potential contamination of myofibers. Muscle mincing/digestionTransfer washed muscles using second pair of autoclaved forceps to two 1.",
    "5 ml Eppendorf tubes (one tube for each hind limb muscle group) containing collection/washing/mincing solution and mince muscles very finely using second pair of autoclaved scissors (see Note 10).Once muscles are minced, spin-down tubes using an RT centrifuge at 21,130 x g for 30 sec to separate the minced muscle pieces from the collection/washing/mincing solution.Set spun tubes aside under sterile biosafety cabinet.Complete preparation of digestion media by adding 1 ml of collagenase II to base of digestion media prepared previously (see Note 6). Filter the entire digestion mixture using a 0.22 μm syringe filter into a 15 ml tube.Remove the supernatant from the Eppendorf tubes containing the minced muscles (in step C2). To transfer the minced muscles to digestion media tube, cut off the tip of a sterile 1 ml pipette tip to create a large bore to accommodate minced muscles’ size.Transfer a small amount of digestion media to the Eppendorf tubes to resuspend minced muscle and then transfer the mix (minced muscles + digestion media) to the original 15 ml digestion media tube (in step C4).Repeat step C7 until all the minced muscles are transferred from the Eppendorf tubes to the 15 ml tube containing digestion mixture.Close the lid of the 15 ml tube containing minced muscle and digestion media and wrap the lid with Parafilm to avoid any potential leakage.Vortex tube for 5 sec.Place tube horizontally in a 37 °C shaker and shake at 100 rpm for 1 h with another 5 sec vortex half way through (see Note 11).After 1 h, mix should appear cloudy and muscle pieces should be mostly digested and very small (see Note 12).Once digestion is complete, vortex tube containing digested muscle mixture for 5 sec.Spin the tubes at 1,400 x g for 5 min at room temperature.",
    "Under sterile biosafety cabinet, remove supernatant (digestion media) and discard.Resuspend digested muscle pellet in 7 ml of neutralizing/isolation media using a 10 ml serological pipette. Pipet the digested muscle tissue pellet up and down for 20-30 times using a sterile 10 ml pipette. This ensures that most myoblasts are released from the muscle tissues.Place a 70 μm strainer on a 50 ml tube.Pre-wet the 70 μm strainer with 2 ml of neutralizing/isolation media.Collect resuspended muscle pellet mixture (step C16) using a 10 ml serological pipette and pass through the pre-wet 70 μm strainer.Wash the strainer with 2 ml of neutralizing/isolation media to ensure that cells are sticking to strainer (most tissue debris will be removed during this step).In a 15 ml tube, pre-wet a 30 μm filter with 1 ml of neutralizing/isolation media.Pass cell mixture (previously strained through 70 μm strainer) through the pre-wet 30 μm filter. This step will remove large infiltrating cells such as macrophages from the myoblasts.Wash filter with 1 ml of neutralizing/isolation media to ensure that cells are not sticking to the strainer.Spin tubes containing cellular mixture at 1,400 x g for 5 min.Remove supernatant (neutralizing/isolation media) and resuspend cell pellet in 10 ml MGM + bFGF.Seed the cellular mixtures onto the 10% Matrigel pre-coated dish. Visualize the cells under a microscope. At this step, there will be a heterogeneous mixture of muscle particles and cells (Figure 2). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170425/20170425193300_6918.jpgFigure 2.

    "Blue arrows point to tissue/cellular debris; Red arrows point to fibroblasts (large and flat triangular-shaped) and green arrows point to myoblasts (round or bipolar spindle-shaped).Keep the dish in a 37 °C CO2 incubator for 72 h. Do not change medium during this incubation period.After 72 h, you should be able to visualize adherent, small, droplet-shaped myoblasts and large triangular-shaped fibroblasts in addition to remnant tissue debris.At this time, the cells are ready for first pre-plating (see Note 13).Myoblast purification (Pre-Plating)Remove culture media from the dish.Using a 10 ml serological pipette, gently wash adherent cells two times with post-isolation media (F-10 medium containing 1% Pen/Strep).Detach cells by adding 2 ml of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and placing cells at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator for 2 min.Visualize under the microscope to ensure that all cells are detached.Once cells are detached, add 10 ml of MGM + bFGF to dish (see Note 14).Transfer cell mixture to a non-Matrigel coated tissue culture dish and place at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator for 45 min. This will allow larger cells such as fibroblasts to adhere in the bottom of the dish while most myoblasts would still be suspended in the media.During this time, coat a new Petri dish with 10% Matrigel as described above.After 45 min, transfer all supernatant from pre-plating dish to the new Matrigel-coated dish and place the dish in CO2 incubator (see Note 15).Pre-plating step should be performed every 36-48 h until > 98% myoblast purity is achieved (see Note 16). Representative phase contrast images at various steps of myoblast isolation are presented in Figures 2C-2E. Purified myoblast culture image is presented in Figure 2F. Culturing of myoblastsThe purified myoblasts are maintained in culture by incubation in the myoblast growth medium and changing media every other day.",
    "Do not allow cells to reach > 70% confluency (unless experimentally required) as this will lead to pre-mature differentiation and fusion of myoblasts with each other.Expand cells by splitting into multiple 10% Matrigel-coated Petri dishes as needed.The myoblasts can be collected in freezing medium and stored in liquid nitrogen tank or -80 °C freezer like any other cultured cells. Primary myoblasts maintain their proliferation and differentiation capacity once thawed and cultured again.Differentiating primary myoblasts to myotubesCoat tissue culture plates with 10% Matrigel similar to those described above.Plate primary myoblasts in pre-coated Matrigel plates. For obtaining good quality myotubes, myoblasts should be at 85-95% confluency before adding differentiation medium (DM). For a 6-well tissue culture plate, we need 0.75-0.9 x 106 cells per well; however, this number will vary depending on the cell passage number. Low passage cells are normally smaller in size therefore use the higher end of the range to achieve desired confluency, whereas higher passage cells are more elongated and larger in size so the lower end of cell number will be required (see Note 17).Next day, replace myoblast growth medium with DM (see Note 18).DM should be changed every 48 h.Myoblasts align and fusion starts within 24-36 h after incubation in DM. At 48 h, small myotubes can be clearly seen, and by 72-96 h they become large and mature.Immunostaining of primary myoblasts and myotubesRemove culture media from 6-well tissue culture plates containing primary myoblasts or myotubes which are adhered to surface of the wells.Fix adhered cells by adding appropriate amount of 4% PFA to cover cells and incubate 15 min.Remove 4% PFA and gently wash the cells three times with 1x PBS for 5 min each.Permeabilize the cells by adding 0.3% Triton X-100 and incubate for 7 min at room temperature.Remove 0.",
    "3% Triton X-100 and gently wash cells three times with PBS for 5 min each.Remove PBS and block cells by adding 2% BSA solution for 20 min.Prepare primary antibody mixtures in blocking solution. Note: We use 1:10 dilution of Pax7 antibody, 1:200 dilution of MyoD, and 1:200 dilution of MF-20 (i.e., MyHC) antibody.Remove blocking solution and add desired primary antibody mixture to each well.Wrap plates with Parafilm to prevent evaporation of primary antibody solution.Primary antibody incubation can be performed for 1-2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C.Once primary antibody incubation period is completed, remove primary antibody solution and wash cells three times with PBS for 5 min each.Prepare secondary antibody mixture in blocking solution at a concentration of 1:1,500 for each secondary antibody. Note: We use anti-mouse Alexa 568 for red fluorescence and anti-rabbit Alexa 488 for green fluorescence.Wrap plates with Parafilm to prevent evaporation of secondary antibody.Secondary antibody incubation is performed at room temperature for 1 h in the dark.Remove secondary antibody solution and wash cells three times with PBS for 5 min each.Prepare DAPI working solution in PBS.Remove PBS from the wells and add DAPI solution for staining nuclei.DAPI incubation is performed at room temperature for 3 min in the dark.Remove DAPI and wash the cells three times with PBS for 5 min each.Add PBS to the wells.The cells are now ready to be visualized under a fluorescent microscope. Representative images of myoblast culture after staining with anti-Pax7, anti-MyoD, and DAPI are presented in Figure 3. Differentiated myotube culture images after staining with anti-MyHC and DAPI are presented in Figure 4.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170425/20170425193754_6328.jpgFigure 3.
