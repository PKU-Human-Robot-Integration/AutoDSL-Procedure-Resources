    "All animal work was approved by the University of Rochester Committee on Animal Resources.\n1. Solutions\nPrepare Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (1X HBSS) containing calcium, magnesium and no phenol red. Adjust the pH to 7.4 by adding small amounts of HCl or NaOH.\nAdjust the osmolarity to 303 mOsm by adding NaCl or deionized water. Use the buffer during the dissections, specimen preparation and mechanical testing.\n2. Dissections of the Distal Femur and Proximal Humerus with Fully Intact Articular Cartilage\nEuthanize the mouse according to institutional guidelines using a CO2 inhalation chamber followed by cervical dislocation. Follow aseptic technique throughout.\n\tNOTE: Mice between 8 and 81 weeks old of any strain and sex may be used.\nUse the following surgical tools for dissections: micro-scissors (used for making incisions), standard dissecting scissors (used for cutting the bone), scalpel with #11 scalpel blade (used for cutting soft tissue), jeweler's forceps (used for removal of soft tissue) and standard forceps (used for peeling the soft tissue and the skin).\nFor dissections of the distal femur follow the instructions below.\n\t\nPosition the mouse in a supine position.\nMake a small (~5 mm) incision in the skin on the anterior portion of the knee.\nExtend the incision all the way around the knee and pull back the skin to expose the knee joint and leg muscles.\nStarting from the proximal end of the femur, use a scalpel blade (#11) to cut along the distal direction. Position the blade between the quadriceps muscle-tendon unit and the anterior side of the femoral shaft. Extend the cut towards and past the patella and finish by cutting through the middle of the patellar tendon, thereby removing the quadriceps muscle-tendon unit.",
    "Starting from the proximal end of the femur, use a scalpel blade (#11) to cut along the distal direction. Position the blade between the hamstring muscle-tendon unit and the posterior side of the femoral shaft. Once the cut approaches the knee joint, begin cutting through the soft tissue, avoiding contact between the scalpel and the articular surface on the distal condyles of the femur. Finish the cut past the knee joint.\nPull back the quadriceps and hamstring muscles to expose the femur. Cut away any excess muscle on the lateral and medial sides of the femur.\nCut the calf muscle on the posterior side of the proximal tibia and flip the leg to visualize the posterior side of the femur.\nExpose the distal condyles of the femur and posterior surface of the proximal tibia by removing excess tissue around the knee joint.\nCut the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments using a scalpel, cutting away from the femoral condyles. Pull the tibia away from the femur and cut all the ligaments to separate the lower leg from the femur.\nUsing standard dissecting scissors, cut through the femur at the proximal end of the bone (8 mm above the tibio-femoral joint) from the lateral side. After cutting the bone, wipe away any visible marrow on the outside of the bone to avoid possible contamination from bone marrow cells.\n\t\tNOTE: Cutting from lateral side reduces the risk of crack propagation along the bone.\nRemove surrounding soft tissues (i.e., ligaments and excess muscle) from the femur using jeweler's forceps and expose the cartilage on both condyles at the distal end of the femur. Avoid contact between the cartilage and forceps.\nFor dissections of the humerus follow the instructions below.\n\t\nPosition the mouse in a supine position.",
    "Make an incision (~5 mm) in the skin on the posterior side of the elbow using micro-scissors, extend the incision around the elbow and pull back the skin to expose the muscles of the arm and shoulder.\nStarting from the proximal end of the humerus, use a scalpel blade (#11) to cut along the distal direction. Position the blade between the triceps muscle-tendon unit and the posterior side of the humerus. Extend the cut towards the distal end of the humerus and finish by cutting through the triceps tendon.\nThen pull back the triceps towards the proximal end of the humerus until the humeral head is exposed.\nCut the connective tissue around the humeral head using a scalpel blade (#11) without touching the articular surface and remove the limb (arm and shoulder) from the body. Periodically hydrate the articular surface of the humeral head with HBSS.\nDisconnect the humerus from the arm by first breaking off the proximal end of the ulna on the posterior side of the arm using forceps and then cutting the connective tissue around the distal end of the humerus. Remove any excess tissue on the humerus.\nCut off the deltoid tuberosity on the posterior side of the humerus using standard dissecting scissors.\nPlace the dissected specimen(s) into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing HBSS buffer.\n3. Live (Calcein AM) / Dead (Propidium Iodide) Staining Protocol\nStain using calcein AM as follows.\n\t\nMake a stock solution of calcein AM by adding 12.5 µL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) into a vial of 50 µg of calcein AM, resulting in a stock concentration of 4 mg/mL (4.02 mM).",
    "Dilute the stock calcein solution 1:400 in HBSS to reach a concentration of 10 µg/mL (10.05 µM) of calcium AM (for example, add 1.25 µL of stock solution to 500 µL of HBSS).\nCentrifuge the diluted staining solution for 5 s at 2,000 x g to ensure that all of the dye, which may occasionally stick to the walls of the tube, mixes with the buffer. Do not remove the supernatant. Vortex the solution to ensure proper mixing.\nPut the dissected specimen into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing 500 µL of the diluted staining solution. Incubate the specimen at 37 °C for 30 min in a thermomixer while agitating at 800 rpm. Make sure the tubes are covered in aluminum foil to protect from exposure to light.\nTransfer the specimen into calcein AM-free HBSS buffer. At this point, the specimen is ready for mechanical testing.\nPrepare propidium iodide (PI) staining solution as follows.\n\t\nPrepare the PI staining solution by diluting the purchased stock solution (1 mg/mL, 1.5 mM) 1:25 in HBSS to reach 40 µg/mL (60 µM) of PI. For example, add 40 µL of stock solution to 1000 µL of HBSS.\nKeep the PI staining solution covered in aluminum foil to protect it from exposure to light. Use the staining solution immediate after the mechanical test to detect injured cells (see section 4).\n\t\tNOTE: One can perform the PI staining prior to loading as well to more rigorously assess the quality of the dissections.\n4. Mechanical Testing Protocol\nPlace the specimen (femur or humerus) onto the glass slide of a custom microscope-mounted mechanical testing device such that the articular surface on the posterior femoral condyles or humeral head is sitting on the glass (Figure 1).",
    "NOTE: Fasten a 10 mm-long wooden applicator (diameter = 2 mm) to the distal side of the humerus using cyanoacrylate glue before placing it onto the device in order to stabilize the specimen on the flat surface. For a detailed description of the mechanical testing platform see Supplementary File 1: section 1.\nHydrate the specimen with HBSS and place the device with the specimen onto a fluorescence microscope.\nImage the articular chondrocytes stained with calcein AM (excitation/emission wavelengths = 495/515 nm) before (baseline) application of the load under a fluorescence microscope with a 4X dry lens (NA = 0.13). Adjust the acquisition settings to optimize the image quality.\nApply mechanical loading on top of the specimen such that articular cartilage is compressed against the cover glass.\n\t\nFor static loading, apply a prescribed static load (e.g., 0.5 N) on top of the specimen (femur or humerus). Hold the load for 5 min and then remove it.\nFor impact, apply a prescribed impact energy (e.g., 1 mJ) onto the specimen by dropping a cylindrical impactor of known weight (e.g., 0.1 N) from a prescribed height (e.g., 1 cm). Release the load 5 s after the impact.\n\t\tNOTE: The weight of the impactor (mg) and the prescribed height (h) can be converted into impact energy (E) using the following equation: E = mgh.\nIncubate the specimen in PI staining solution for 5 min at room temperature.\nImage the articular chondrocytes stained with calcein AM and PI (excitation/emission wavelengths = 535/617 nm) under a fluorescence microscope (Figure 2).\n5. Data Analysis\nQuantify the area of injured/dead cells due to the applied mechanical loading regimen.\n\t\nOpen the micrographs of the articular surface acquired before and after application of mechanical load in ImageJ18.\nCombine the images into a stack.",
    "Set the scale of the images based on the image resolution.\nUse the Polygon tool to define the area where the cells became calcein-negative (loss of green fluorescence) and PI-positive (gain of red fluorescence). These cells are considered to be injured or dead.\nDetermine the area of injured/dead cells using the Measurement tool.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
