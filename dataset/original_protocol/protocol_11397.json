    "All animal work was performed in accordance with animal welfare act, institutional guidelines and approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Sun Yat-sen University.\n1. Preparation of TEM\nExecute mice by cervical dislocation and remove the tongues using sterile surgical scissors and tweezers.\nImmerse the tongues in 75% ethanol for 3 min, then put each tongue into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf (EP) tube with 1 mL of 10 mM sterile phosphate buffered solution (PBS).\n\tNOTE: The concentration of PBS in all the following steps is same as the concentration in this step.\nCell lysis by freeze thaw: Freeze the tongues in EP tubes at -80 °C for 1 h, and then thaw the tongues at room temperature for 45 min for 3 cycles.\nLoad each tongue onto a piece of surgical suture using a surgical needle and wrap the end of the suture with a small piece of sterile tinfoil. Perform the operation in a 3.5 cm or 6 cm culture dish containing 75% ethanol in sterile conditions.\n\tNOTE: The appropriate length of each piece of surgical suture is about 20 cm, and the appropriate size of each piece of tinfoil is about 0.3 cm2 (1 cm × 0.3 cm). The tongue should be loaded near the tinfoil.\nRinse each tongue with 3 mL of sterile PBS in a 3.5 cm or 6 cm culture dish for 30 s. Perform this operation in sterile conditions.\nWash the tongues with ultrapure water: Add ampicilin into a wide-mouth bottle with 250 mL of sterile ultrapure water to a final concentration of 90 µg/mL. Put the tongues into the bottle containing a stir bar. Tighten the bottle cap with part of the suture remaining outside the bottle. Perform this operation in sterile conditions.",
    "NOTE: Up to 5 tongues can be put into the same bottle in consideration of twining of the suture. The tinfoil is at the end of the suture in the bottle to prevent the tongue from slipping off. The tongues should be placed 2 cm high from the bottom of the bottle by adjusting the length of the suture remaining inside the bottle. This note is also for steps 1.8, 1.10, 1.12, and 1.16.\nPut the bottle on a magnetic stirrer for 12 h.\nWash the tongues with NaCl: Add ampicilin into a wide-mouth bottle with 250 mL of sterile 1 M NaCl to a final concentration of 90 µg/mL. Move the tongues and the stir bar into the bottle. Tighten the bottle cap with part of the suture remaining outside the bottle. Perform this operation in sterile conditions.\nPut the bottle on a magnetic stirrer for 24 h.\nCell lysis by Triton X-100: Add ampicilin to a final concentration of 90 µg/mL into a wide-mouth bottle with 250 mL of sterile 2% Triton X-100 in PBS. Move the tongues and the stir bar into the bottle. Tighten the bottle cap with part of the suture remaining outside the bottle. Perform this operation in sterile conditions.\nPut the bottle on a magnetic stirrer for 48 h.\nWash tongues with CaCl2/MgCl2: Add ampicilin into a wide-mouth bottle with 250 mL of sterile 5 mM CaCl2/MgCl2 to a final concentration of 90 µg/mL. Move the tongues and the stir bar into the bottle. Tighten the bottle cap with part of the suture remaining outside the bottle. Perform this operation in sterile conditions.\nPut the bottle on a magnetic stirrer for 24 h.",
    "Digestion by DNase: Add 1 mL of Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) to each EP tube. Add DNase into HBSS respectively to a final concentration of 300 µM. Move each tongue into each EP tube, with part of the suture outside the tube. Perform this operation in sterile conditions.\n\tNOTE: Make sure that the part of suture which remains inside the bottles in previous steps also remains inside the EP tube in this step, and make sure that the part of suture which remains outside the bottles in previous steps also remains outside the EP tube in this step.\nIncubate the tongues in EP tubes at 37 °C for 24 h.\nWash the tongues with PBS: Add ampicilin into a wide-mouth bottle with 250 mL of sterile PBS to a final concentration of 90 µg/mL. Move the tongues and the stir bar into the bottle. Tighten the bottle cap with part of the suture remaining outside the bottle. Perform this operation in sterile conditions.\nPut the bottle on a magnetic stirrer for 24 h.\nStore the prepared TEM in sterile PBS at 4 °C until use.\n2. Three-dimensional (3D) Reconstitution of TSCC\nStatic TSCC model construction\nSeed 1.0 x 106 single TSCC cells (Cal27) into a 3.5 cm culture dish. Add 3 mL of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 (DF12) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 90 µg/mL ampicilin, and 90 µg/mL kanamycin.\nCulture the Cal27 cells at 37 °C for 2 to 3 days. Make sure that the cells cover at least 60% area of the dish bottom.\nLoad TEM onto the Cal27 monolayer in the culture dish.\nPut the dish into a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 28 days.\nRefresh the culture medium every day during the cell culture process. The CO2 concentration in the incubator is 5%.",
    "Stirred TSCC model construction\nPreparation of a self-made stirred minibioreactor\nTake out the plunger from a 10 mL syringe.\nDig a hole (diameter of 1 cm) near the lower terminal of the rod and load a stir bar in the hole.\nDig a hole (diameter of 0.5 cm) at the center of the bottle cap of a plastic wide-mouth bottle and put the piston rod through the cap.\nCut half of a 50 mL centrifuge tube and weld it on the outer side of the bottle cap.\nAttach fishhooks to the rod by wrapping the rod with fishing lines which are tied to the fishhooks.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Up to 4 fishhooks can be attached to a rod.\nAutoclave the self-made complex before use.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Do not autoclave the plastic wide-mouth bottle. Use a new sterile plastic wide-mouth bottle while culturing cells.\nDynamic cell culture\nSeed 1.0 x 106 single Cal27 cells in the self-made minibioreactor. Add 150 mL of DF12 medium which contains 10% FBS, 90 µg/mL ampicilin, and 90 µg/mL kanamycin.\nLoad TEM onto the minibioreactor using the fishhooks attached to the rod.\nTighten the bottle cap and put the minibioreactor on a magnetic stirrer. Activate the minibioreactor at 200 rpm in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 7 to 14 days.\n\t\tNOTE: The concentration of CO2 in the CO2 incubator is 5%.\nSubscription Required.
