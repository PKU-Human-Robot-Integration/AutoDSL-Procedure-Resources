    "All animal protocols were in accordance with the US National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at UCLA.\n1.1) Prepare Micropipette and AAV2/5 Virus Loading\nUse fine borosilicate glass micropipettes for the injection of the virus. Pull the micropipette using a two-step pulling program with a vertical puller. Bevel the pipette at an angle of 40° by using a pipette grinder. The pipette that is ideal for use will have a tip diameter of 20 - 40 μm and a shank length of 6 - 7 mm. Autoclave the pipette and surgical instruments. The drill is sterilized by wiping with 70% ethanol.\nStore the virus AAV2/5-GfaABC1D.cyto-GCaMP3.SV40 (1.5 x 1013 gc/ml), at -80 °C in 10 μl aliquots. Just before surgery, take out the aliquots out of the freezer and store on ice until used for filling the micropipette.\nFill the micropipette with virus using a syringe pump. Tightly connect one end of a piece of tubing, through an appropriately sized tubing compression fitting, to a glass syringe with a reinforced plunger. Attach the autoclaved micropipette to the other end of the piece of tubing through an appropriately sized removable needle compression fitting.\nBefore loading the viral vector, remove air bubbles from the pumping system including tubing, syringe and micropipette by filling the system with mineral oil colored with Sudan red IV (~1 mg/50 ml) in a 1 ml syringe with a needle (27 G).\nPlace a clean piece of parafilm under the glass micropipette, and dispense 5 - 10 μl of the viral vector onto the parafilm.",
    "Suck the viral vector by moving the plunger of the syringe backward at 0.5 μl/min, and mark the boundary between the vector and the oil on the glass pipette.\n1.2) Anesthesia, Hair Cutting, Head Fixation and Preparation for Craniotomy\nPut a mouse (P49-63, C57BL/6) into the chamber filled with N2O and O2, and 5% isoflurane. Assess the depth of anesthesia by loss of purposeful movement and a slowed respiratory rate (~60 - 90/min). Cut hair on the head when the mouse is anesthetized.\nFit the mouse in the stereotaxic frame, with its head secured by blunt ear bars and its nose placed into an anesthesia and ventilation system. Maintain continuous isoflurane at 2 - 3%. Apply artificial tears ointment to both eyes since mice lose their blink reflex under anesthesia.\nAdminister 0.05 ml of Buprenorphine (0.1 mg/ml) by subcutaneous injection for pain relief.\nClean surgical area with 10% povidone iodine and 70% alcohol three times, alternating between the two solutions and starting with povidone iodine. Start from the front and wipe toward the back to remove any already cut hairs.\nMake a skin incision on top of the head which starts between the eyes and ends between the ears.\n1.3) Craniotomy and Microinjections\nRemove the periosteum by swiping with a cotton swab and then dry the surface of the skull with dental cotton balls. Make a mark around the injection site, and drill around the edge of the mark using a small steel burr powered by a high speed drill.\nRemove the bone and clean the surface with saline.",
    "Place the pipette into the left dorsal lateral striatum with the following coordinates (mm): anterior-posterior +0.8, medial-lateral: +2.0, dorsal-ventral from the pial surface: -2.4 13. Note that these coordinates mean that the tip of the microinjection needle sits just above the dorsolateral striatum (Figure 1A, B), meaning that it only slightly penetrates within this nucleus. Avoid damaging blood vessels. If the pipette happens to be right on a blood vessel, slightly adjust the coordinates by ~0.1 - 0.2 mm.\nStart injection with injection rate set at 0.2 μl/min, and typically inject 1 to 1.5 μl of virus.\nLeave the pipette in place after the injection for 10 min, and then withdraw the pipette slowly.\nFinish by closing the surgical wound with continuous suture external nylon suture.\n1.4) Recovery\nPut the mouse in a clean cage on a heating pad for 24 hr. Do not return a mouse that has undergone surgery to the company of other animals until fully recovered. Do not leave the mouse unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\nAdd Trimethoprim Sulfamethoxiazole (5 ml per 500 ml water, containing 40 mg trimethoprim and 200 mg sulfamethoxiazole) in the water for a week. Administer Buprenorphine two times per day for up to 3 days after surgery.\nMaintain the mouse on a 12 hr light-dark cycle, fed and watered daily, and is weighted once per day up to 3 days after surgery. In these 3 days, any mouse with a loss of more than 10% body weight is considered as compromised, and will be euthanized instead of being subjected to experimentation.\nSeparately, change the mouse cage twice per week, and monitor for general health at least once per day. Typically, the mouse is used within 2 - 3 weeks after the stereotaxic microinjections.",
    "2. Acute Brain Slice Preparation for Confocal Ca2+ Imaging\n2.1) Preparation of Cutting and Recording Solutions.\nPrepare cutting solution comprising (mM): 194 sucrose, 30 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 10 D-glucose, 1 MgCl2, 1.2 NaH2PO4, and 26 NaHCO3, saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2.\nPrepare recording solution comprising (mM): 124 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, 2 CaCl2, 1.2 NaH2PO4, and 26 NaHCO3; pH 7.3 - 7.4, 290 - 295 mOsm, saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Fill the brain slice holding beaker with recording solution, and keep it at 34 °C.\n2.2) Slicing\nTwo to three weeks after stereotaxic microinjections, deeply and terminally anesthetize the mouse, and then decapitate it.\nExtract the brain, and use a blade to remove the uninjected right hemisphere, and mount the left one onto the vibratome tray using super glue. Fill the vibratome tray with ice cold cutting buffer, and keep saturating it with 95% O2 and 5% CO2.\nCut coronal or sagittal striatal brain slices at 300 μm thickness. Usually, 4 - 5 coronal, or 6 - 7 sagittal striatal slices can be collected.\nTransfer the slices to the slice holding beaker warmed at 34 °C, and keep them there for 30 min before storing them at room temperature for subsequent recording.\nIncubate the brain slices in oxygenated recording buffer at room temperature for at least 30 min before [Ca2+]i imaging.\n3. Immunohistochemistry (IHC)\nTwo weeks after virus injection, perfuse the mouse transcardially with PBS followed by 10% formalin in PBS.\nRemove, post-fix overnight, and cryoprotect the brain in buffered 30% sucrose for at least 2 days.\nPrepare 40 μm sections using a cryostat microtome.\nRinse sections 3 times with PBS at 10 min interval.\nIncubate sections for 1 hr in PBS with 10% normal goat serum and with 0.5% Triton X-100.",
    "Incubate sections overnight at 4 °C in primary antibody prepared in PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100. The primary antibodies used were as follows: chicken anti-GFP 1:1,000, mouse anti-S100β 1:400, mouse anti-NeuN 1:600, mouse anti-glutamine synthetase 1:300.\nRinse sections 3 times with PBS at 10 min intervals.\nIncubate sections with the secondary antibodies prepared in PBS with 10% normal goat serum for 2 hr at room temperature. The second antibodies were as follows: goat anti-mouse Alexa546 1:500, goat anti-chicken Alexa488 1:500.\nMount the sections on glass slides, dry and apply several drops of antifade mounting medium, then slowly cover the sections with a glass coverslip. Store the slides at 4 °C.\nTake images on a confocal microscope with a 40X oil immersion lens with a numerical aperture of 1.3.\n4. Confocal [Ca2+]i Imaging\nNOTE: [Ca2+]i imaging was done using a confocal microscope with a 40X water immersion objective lens with a numerical aperture of 0.8.\nBetween 1 and 5 hr after slicing, place slice in the recording chamber and superfuse with oxygenated recording buffer at room temperature with flow rate of 1 - 2 ml per min. Then place a platinum harp with nylon strings on top of the slice to minimize movement during the experiment.\nVisualize and locate the dorsal striatum with bright field luminescence under a 10X water immersion objective.\nSwitch to the 40X water immersion objective lens, and turn on the 488 nm line of the Argon laser. By changing the focal plane, find cells located about 20 μm below the slice surface, displaying basal fluorescence in soma, branches and branchlets. Of note, compromised cells usually display fluorescence level above average, which should be avoided.",
    "Use ‘frame scan’ mode to start scanning. Usually, the laser intensity adjusted to 0.5 – 5% of the maximum output is sufficient to image [Ca2+]i with cyto-GCaMP3. For monitoring [Ca2+]i dynamics in the whole territory of astrocytes, the ‘frame scan’ with a scan rate of 1 sec per frame or faster is recommended, but this needs to be decided depending on the experiment in question.\nIf necessary, to image [Ca2+]i in processes, use digital magnification of 2 - 3 fold to monitor 1 - 2 astrocytes in the whole field of view.\nTo avoid saturated pixels during recording, use ‘HiLo’ lookup mode to pseudocolor the cells. Always start with a “pilot recording” for about 5 min, to test if red color appears as indication of saturation. If so, lower the laser output power, or lower the PMT/Gain/offset values and perform another pilot recording to test the pixel values are in the non saturated range. Typically, the combined parameters used for imaging astrocyte [Ca2+]i in the striatum are as follows: laser output power 0.5 - 5% (of 10 mW), PMT 550 - 650 Volts, Gain 2.0 - 3.5X, and offset 0 - 5%.\nSubscription Required.
