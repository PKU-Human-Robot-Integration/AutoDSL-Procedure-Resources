    "Preparation of 5% sodium alginate Dissolve 1 g of sodium alginate in 20 mL sterile distilled water in a 50 mL beaker to make a 5% sodium alginate solution.Stir the solution overnight using a magnetic stirrer at room temperature until the final solution is clear and bubble-free.Worm block preparation On a coverslip, add a small drop of 5% sodium alginate solution at room temperature and slightly spread it to make it sufficiently thick for the worms to immerse.Place the worms (one can add 1–4 worms per coverslip) in the sodium alginate layer.Allow the worms to settle for 2 min with minimum thrashing movements. To avoid overflow of the solution, place a plastic ring of 0.5 cm diameter as a barrier. To the inside of the ring, add 100 μL of 100 mM CaCl2 (as the divalent ions) to polymerize the sodium alginate solution with the worm entrapped inside. Within 2–3 min, the sodium alginate will polymerize at room temperature (see Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4697/bioprotoc-13-12-4697-g001.jpgFigure 1. Preparation of alginate scaffold to entrap worms. Worms were placed in the 5% sodium alginate prior to the addition of 100 mM CaCl2 to polymerize sodium alginate solution. Microscopic image showing an immobilized worm.After polymerization, remove the plastic ring and wipe off the excess CaCl2 solution using filter paper. Alginate polymerization will occur around the worm, and the worms will show restricted movements.Worm viability within alginate gel Observe the immobilized worms for 2 min to record their movement with and without exposure to fluorescent light.The head bends can be measured as a sign of viability.The worms can be kept in the alginate scaffold for more than 30 min at room temperature.The worms can be kept in a humid chamber to avoid dehydration for repeated recording.",
    "Olfactory stimulation As the odor delivery system for this study, a piece of Whatman filter paper (0.3 × 0.3 mm) was placed on the tip of a glass capillary tube.Attach the capillary tube to the Eppendorf InjectMan’s arm in order to measure and maintain a constant distance between the worm and the odor source (Figure 2).In order to measure the calcium kinetics in ring interneuron D (RID) neurons, stimulate the strain ZM9078 (hpls587–GcaMP6) with 1/300 diluted IAA.Saturate the Whatman filter paper with 5 μL of the 1/300 diluted IAA and keep it 1 mm away from the worm.Move the capillary away from the worm using the joystick after 20 s of exposure.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4697/bioprotoc-13-12-4697-g002.jpgFigure 2. Setup for olfactory stimulation. Leica DMi8 automated fluorescent microscope with the Eppendorf InjectMan. A. Whatman filter paper. B. capillary tube. C. Eppendorf InjectMan’s arm.Image acquisition For calcium imaging, use a Leica DMi8 automated fluorescent microscope and LasX image acquisition software to manage the imaging process (Leica).Use 20× magnification to capture time-lapse pictures.The exposure time for fluorescence imaging is 150 ms.Leica DFC7000T camera time-lapse sequences are captured for up to 2 min (2 frames/s).Image processing Perform image processing with Fiji software. Capture images in the JPG file format.Draw a region of interest (ROI) over the RID motor neuron in ZM9078 (hpIs587–GCaMP6) strain.Two macro files were written for image processing.ROI_Calulation.ijm // This macro moves across images // Finds the maximum pixel value for (i=1; i<=nImages; i++) {    selectImage(i);    processImage(); //or simply put your processing commands here. }  function processImage() { getRawStatistics(nPixels, mean, min, max);    run(\"Find Maxima...\", \"noise=\"+max+\" output=[Point Selection]\");    getSelectionBounds(x, y, w, h);    makeOval((x-70), (y-40), 140, 90); } Measure_Values.ijm // This macro moves across images // Finds the maximum pixel value for (i=1; i<=nImages; i++) {    selectImage(i); //  run(\"Set Measurements...",
    "\", \"area mean min integrated redirect=None decimal=3\"); run(\"Measure\"); } Use ROI_calculation.ijm macro to draw ROI in the images.Calculate fluorescent intensity measurement with Measure_values.ijm macro (see Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4697/bioprotoc-13-12-4697-g003.jpgFigure 3.
