    "Preparation and ex vivo infection of human tissue Preparation and ex vivo infection of total (full-thickness) human skin (Figures 1, 2)Directly after surgery, store and transport intact skin biopsies in DMEM-high glucose-GlutaMAX containing 10% FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at RT. Avoid long storage times. Otherwise, store biopsies at 4°C until ready to use.Place skin biopsies in a clean working surface Class II biosafety cabinet and carefully remove subcutaneous fat using forceps and surgical scissors (Figure 1a).Once cleaned of fat and underlying dermis is visible, use a scalpel (#21) to cut intact skin into 5 × 5 mm pieces (Figure 1b).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4411/bioprotoc-12-09-4411-g001.jpgFigure 1. Preparation of (full-thickness) human skin (a, b) and skin shaves (c). Wash total (full-thickness) skin pieces 3× with PBS and place (1 per well) in a 24-well tissue culture plate for infection.Prepare virus suspension using filter tips in 1 mL of DMEM-high glucose-GlutaMAX containing 10% FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin with MOI of interest (we suggest using 10–100 PFU/cell). The calculation of virus dose can be determined by the approximate cell-count of the surface area of a 5 × 5 mm full-thickness skin (approximately 2.5 × 105 cells).Submerge the total (full-thickness) skin in virus-containing medium (1 mL) for infection.Infect for the desired amount of time/time-points (max. 24 h) in a 5% CO2 incubator, set at 37°C.At the desired time-point(s), remove the virus suspension using filter tips and wash once with PBS.Immediately embed in Truncated T8 Peel-A-Way embedding Molds containing Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound and freeze at -80°C for preparation as cryosections.Alternatively, fix in 3.4% formaldehyde directly in the tissue culture plates for 2 h at RT or overnight at 4°C for preparation as paraffin samples.For whole mount analysis, follow steps C3–C8. Exception: avoid incubation at 37°C (see Note 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4411/bioprotoc-12-09-4411-g002.jpgFigure 2.

    "(a) Schematic illustration of the procedure described in A. HE-stained sections prior to infection and 24 h p.i. Scale bars, 50 μm. (b) Immunostainings of cryosections visualize infected (viral ICP0-expressing) (green) cells only at the sample edge at 16 h after infection at 100 PFU/cell. Collagen VII (colVII) (red) depicts the basement membrane, and DAPI (blue) serves as a nuclear counterstain. Transmission light (TL) visualizes an edge and middle part of a skin sample. Scale bars, 50 μm.Preparation and ex vivo infection of skin shaves (Figures 1, 3)Follow the above steps A1–A3.Use skin samples with a size of at least 15 cm2.Wrap the skin around your index finger to stretch the skin and, using a scalpel, shave off the apical part including the epidermis and the underlying apical part of the dermis. Take shaves of approximately 1 mm thickness (Figure 1c).Trim shaves into 3 × 3 mm pieces.Proceed with steps described in A4–A9.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4411/bioprotoc-12-09-4411-g003.jpgFigure 3. Preparation and ex vivo infection of skin shaves. (a) Schematic illustration of the procedure described in B. HE-stained sections prior to infection. Scale bar, 50 μm. (b) Immunostainings of cryosections show the middle part of a skin shave. Transmission light (TL) visualizes the morphology, collagen VII (colVII) (red) depicts the basement membrane, and DAPI (blue) serves as a nuclear counterstain. Scale bar, 50 μm.Preparation and ex vivo infection of isolated human epidermis (Figure 4)Follow the above steps A1–A3.Place total (full-thickness) skin pieces in 6-well plates (approximately 10–15 pieces can fit in one well) and wash 3× with PBS.Using a precision scale, weigh 4 U/mL dispase II in a 50 mL conical centrifuge tube and dissolve in PBS by vortexing.Prepare a new 50 mL centrifuge tube and filter sterilize the dispase II solution using a 0.20 μm syringe filter.",
    "Place 2 mL of the dispase II solution per well in a 6-well plate containing total skin pieces so that the skin pieces are floating in solution (ensure that the epidermis is facing up).Incubate overnight at 4°C.Wash the dispase II-treated skin pieces 3× with PBS.Using two forceps, gently peel off the epidermis from dermis by starting at the corners of the skin. If met with resistance, incubate samples in dispase II solution for an additional 15 minutes at 37°C and repeat if necessary (see video Rahn et al., 2015a).Place isolated epidermal samples in 1 mL of PBS in 24-well tissue culture plates while virus suspension is prepared.Prepare virus suspension in DMEM-high glucose-GlutaMAX containing 10% FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin with MOI of interest. The calculation of virus dose can be determined by the approximate cell-count of the basal layer of a 5 × 5 mm epidermal sample (approx. 3 × 105 cells).Replace the PBS in the wells containing the epidermal samples with virus-containing medium (1 mL). The epidermal sheets should be floating with the basal side facing down.Infect for the desired amount of time/time-points in a 5% CO2 incubator, set at 37°C.At the desired time-point(s), remove the virus suspension and wash once with PBS.Immediately embed in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound and freeze at -80°C for preparation as cryosections.Alternatively, fix piece in 3.4% formaldehyde for 2 h at RT or overnight at 4°C for preparation as paraffin samples or as whole mounts.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4411/bioprotoc-12-09-4411-g004.jpgFigure 4.

    "(b) After infection at 100 PFU/cell for 6 h, immunostaining of epidermal whole mount visualizes infected cells with nuclear ICP0 punctae (green) and some cells with cytoplasmic ICP0 (green) in the basal layer. Immunostainings of cryosections show the epidermis with ICP0-expressing (green) cells at 6 h p.i. and no infected cells after mock-infection. DAPI (blue) serves as a nuclear counterstain, and loricrin (lor) (red) mainly depicts the granular layer. Scale bars, 50 μm.Preparation and ex vivo infection of isolated human dermis (Figure 5)Follow the above steps C1–C8.Place isolated dermal samples in 1 mL of PBS in 24-well tissue culture plates while virus suspension is prepared.Prepare 1 mL of virus suspension in DMEM-high glucose-GlutaMAX containing 10% FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin with MOI of interest. The calculation of virus dose can be determined by the approximate cell-count in the surface area of a 5 × 5 mm dermis (approx. 2 × 105 cells).Infect for the desired amount of time/time points in a 5% CO2 incubator, set at 37°C.At the desired time point(s), remove the virus suspension and wash once with PBS.Immediately embed in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound and freeze at -80°C for preparation as cryosections or whole mount.Alternatively, fix piece in 3.4% formaldehyde for 2h at RT or overnight at 4°C for preparation as paraffin samples.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4411/bioprotoc-12-09-4411-g005.jpgFigure 5. Preparation and ex vivo infection isolated human dermis. (a) Schematic illustration of the procedure described in D. HE-stained sections prior to infection and 24 h p.i. Scale bars, 50 μm. (b) After infection at 50 PFU/cell, immunostainings of cryosections visualize only some ICP0-expressing cells (green) at 24 h p.i. with DAPI (blue) as a nuclear counterstain. Transmission light (TL) shows the morphology. Scale bars, 50 μm."
