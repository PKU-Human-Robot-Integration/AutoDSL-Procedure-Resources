    "Laodelphaxstriatellus carrying RSV was used to transmit the virus to health rice seedling. After inoculation on rice seedling for 48 h, the rice plants were maintained in greenhouse at 30 °C in light (16 h) and 26°C in dark(8 h) for 60 days. The RSV-infected rice leaves showing the typical leaf stripe symptoms were collected (Figure 1A).Keep 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB), pH 7.5, containing 0.01 M EDTA (PB-EDTA), and a blender at 4 °C.Cut 50 g RSV-infected rice leaves into small pieces (about 2 cm) with razor blades and then ground them in 800 ml chilled PB-EDTA in the chilled blender for 5 min.Filter the homogenate through two layers of gauze to remove large debris.Centrifuge the filtered extract at 8,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove fine cell debris.During centrifugation, weigh PEG 6000 powder (we grind PEG 6000 into fine powders before use) and NaCl according to the supernatant volume.Transfer the supernatant into a sterilized and pre-chilled 1 L glass beaker.Slowly add PEG 6000 and NaCl into the glass beaker till a final concentration of 6% PEG (w/v) and 0.1 M NaCl. Stir the mixture at 4 °C for 4 h and then allow this mixture to stand overnight at 4 °C.Centrifuge this mixture at 8,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C, using an angle rotor in a refrigerated centrifuge, to pellet RSV virions.Resuspend the pellet in 8 ml 0.01 M PB-EDTA and centrifuge again at 8,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Transfer the supernatant into a clean pre-chilled centrifuge tube. Repeat Step 9 twice.Combine the three supernatant in a pre-chilled ultra-centrifuge tube for the 70Ti rotor and centrifuge at 150,000 x g for 2 h at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 6 ml 0.",
    "01 M PB.Add 4 ml 20% glycerol solution into a clean ultra-clear centrifuge tube for the 90Ti rotor to form a glycerol cushion.Carefully lay the resuspended pellet solution on top of the glycerol cushion and centrifuge at 150,000 x g for 2 h at 4 °C.After centrifugation (Figure 1B), discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 4 ml PB through repeated pipetting.Prepare 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% sucrose solutions. 2 ml 40% sucrose solution was firstly added into the bottom of ultra-centrifuge tube and then slowly add 2 ml each of 30%, 20% and 10% sucrose solutions, sequentially, on the top of 10% sucrose solution with pipettes.Carefully lay the resuspended pellet solution on a 10-40% sucrose density gradient inside a clean ultra-centrifuge tube for the SW32.1 rotor and centrifuge at 70,000 x g for 2 h at 4 °C.Place the centrifuge tube under a light source and two separate bands become visible (Figure 1C, M and B). Collect the two bands separately and analyze them by SDS-PAGE (Figure 2A), Western blot (Figure 2B) and TEM (Figure 3). Add glycerol into the purified virion sample (M band) to reach a final concentration of 30%. Store the sample at -70 °C till further use.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200315/20200315192453_1912.jpgFigure 1.
