    "NOTE: Before beginning any TMS protocols, there are three precautionary statements. First, patients and operators should use earplugs with a 30 dB rating. Second, patients with ferromagnetic material in the skull cannot receive TMS. Finally, patients with epilepsy must have protocol modifications. In addition, the individual's motor threshold (MT) must be determined (see below for the specific procedure). The MT is defined as the lowest machine intensity necessary to activate a muscle in five out of ten attempts (50%), typically the abductor pollicis brevis, by visual inspection. MT is used to adjust the stimulator output for the specific individual receiving the treatment. Each protocol includes specific parameters, such as the stimulation frequency, the number of trains, the inter-train interval (ITI), or the number of pulses in each train. Each disorder has a minimum number of daily or thrice-weekly treatments that should be attempted before someone can be considered a treatment failure, and responders generally need a prolonged course of twice-weekly treatments to get maximal sustained benefit. Additionally, patients in recovery may benefit from weekly maintenance treatments. Continuation and maintenance protocols for the different disorders are still being studied, but all of the parameters that were used in the preliminary investigations are provided in Table 1 and should be referred to for each specific disorder. Patients undergoing dTMS should have a baseline assessment with clinician and patient rating scales, as well as follow-up scales. The definition of disease states and the rating scale options to define improvement and remission are beyond the scope of this paper. An example of a patient rating scale for depression would be the quick inventory of depressive symptoms or the Beck depression inventory. An example of a clinician rating scale is the clinician's global impression or the Hamilton depression rating scale.",
    "These scales have defined cutoffs for remission, while a 50% drop in the score is defined as response.",

It will not focus on programing the stimulator. That information is more readily available in the instructions for use that comes with the device. These protocols were designed in accordance with the principles outlined in the declaration of Helsinki.\n1. Measure the Motor Threshold\nPlace the blue cap with the two intercepting rulers on the subject.\nPlace the 0-cm mark of the white sagittal ruler on the nasion and the 25 cm mark of the clear coronal ruler at 40% of the nasion-inion distance, with the 0 on the left side of the patient's head.\nUse the helmet to find the resting MT of the right hand, starting with the front of the helmet 7 cm from the nasion and the left side of the coil tilted 2 cm to the right.",
    "Using the \"Single Pulse\" mode on the stimulator touch screen, administer single pulses at 50% of the stimulator output while observing the patient's resting right hand. Increase the stimulator intensity if no visible movement is observed or if a visible movement is observed less than 50% of the time. Initially, use 5% intervals.\nDecrease the stimulator intensity if a visible movement is observed more than 50% of the time. Start with 5% intervals and then fine-tune it.\nRepeat steps 1.4 and 1.5 to identify the minimal MT. This location is called the \"hot spot.\"\n2. Setting Up Parameters Within the Device User Interface\nPress \"Repetitive Mode\" on the stimulator touchscreen.\nEnter parameters by touching the boxes on the screen and adjusting them using the side wheel. Enter the parameters from Table 1 and press \"Run Session.\"\nArm the machine by pressing the green button. Warn the patient that the stimulation is starting, and start the stimulation with the yellow button or the pedal.\n3. Stimulate the MC for Parkinson's or MS Fatigue\nAfter finding the MT, straighten the helmet in a symmetrical fashion over the MC, with the 0 on the front of the helmet over the sagittal ruler.\n4. Stimulate the Left PFC for Depression, Bipolar Depression, Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia, and Migraine\nAdvance the tilted helmet from the MT location over the MC to the left PFC by moving it 6 cm forward along the sagittal ruler.\n5. Stimulate the mPFC for Alcohol Dependence or PTSD\nPlace the helmet over the mPFC, symmetrically with respect to right-left, with the 0 mark on the helmet's front edge aligned with the 3 cm mark on the sagittal ruler of the cap (i.e., 3 cm from the nasion).\n6. Stimulate the Right PFC for Generalized Anxiety or Panic Disorder",
    "Find the left-hand MT with the helmet (following the mirror image of steps 1.3-1.4 by tilting the helmet 2 cm to the left and watching the resting left hand).\nMove the tilted helmet 6 cm forward along the sagittal ruler to the right PFC.\n7. Stimulate the Left TPJ for Tinnitus or Auditory Hallucinations\nPlace the helmet over the left TPJ by moving the coil 4.5 cm posteriorly and 6.5 cm laterally (to the left shoulder) from the right-hand MC \"hot spot.\"\n8. Electrical Field Measurements\nAttach the coil to an inverted saline-filled head over the left DLPFC. Set the stimulator intensity to 50%. Using a dipole probe connected to an oscilloscope, move it cm by cm so that, when single pulses are delivered through the coil, the oscilloscope measures the induced electric field at each point in the saline-filled head26.\n\tNOTE: The process of producing field maps based on the head model measurements is beyond the scope of this paper. In short, the field values at any point are normalized according to the relevant protocol. For instance, for depression, the accepted protocol is 120% of MT. Hence, the field values are scaled so that the value at the hand MC is 120 V/m, while the threshold for neural stimulation is defined as 100 V/m. Then, a color map of the electric field distribution in the brain is produced, where pixels with a field of 100 V/m or above are indicated in red so that one can see which brain regions are stimulated above the threshold for neural stimulation. The colored field maps are superimposed on MRI scans of the brain26,27."
