JNG virus infection/chemical delivery\nTiming: 1 h\nTiming: 30 min for preoperative preparation\nTiming: 30 min for JNG intraganglionic injection\nPreoperative preparation. Preoperative drug administration, anesthesia induction, and surgical site preparation.\nWeigh the animal.\nAdminister preoperative analgesia: Subcutaneous administration (s.c.) of 0.05 mg/Kg Buprenorphine and anticholinergics: 0.1 mg/Kg Atropine (s.c.), 15 mins before starting surgery.\nPlace the animal inside an induction chamber with 3% isoflurane for 1 min. Then maintain the isoflurane to 1.5% after transferring the animal to the surgical platform.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to both eyes.\nUse tape to fix the animal on a supine position and spread the hair-removal cream from chin to thorax. Five minutes later, wipe the cream and hair away using saline pads.\nDisinfect the surgical area with povidone-iodine prep pads and wipe the area with 75% ethanol pads, three times.\nNote: Fresh dilute Buprenorphine stock solution (0.3 mg/mL) with 0.9% saline into working solution (0.015 mg/mL). Storage of Buprenorphine dilutions is forbidden.\nNote: Dilute Atropine stock solution (0.4 mg/mL) with 0.9% saline into working solution (0.02 mg/mL). Atropine dilutions can be kept for six month at room temperature.\nCritical: 6–8 weeks old, 20–25 g males and females mice are optimal for JNG surgery. Excessive adipose tissue surrounding the carotid sheath in an overweight animal will obstruct the surgical vision and possibly lead to an imprecise approach followed by hemorrhage.\nJNG intraganglionic injection. This part involves retracting the submandibular glands, and then the sternocleidomastoid and omohyoid muscles, to expose the carotid sheath. Second, the vagus nerve should be detached from the carotid artery until the JNG becomes accessible. Then 500 nL of CCK-SAP, at 2 nL/s, can be delivered with the Nanofil Sub-Microliter Injection System mounted on the programmable syringe pump. In detail:",

    "Pierce through the carotid sheath and separate the common carotid artery ⑤ using a spinal cord hook [FST, 10162-12] (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F) to expose the vagus nerve ⑥ (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G).\nOpen the carotid sheath rostrally until fully exposing the vagus root and superior laryngeal branch ⑥ (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]H).\nCarefully remove the connective tissue surrounding the vagus root ⑥ rostral to the superior laryngeal branch to expose the superior cervical ganglion ⑦ (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]I).\nCautiously tear off the brown adipose tissue ⑧, which is located on the ventral side of the superior cervical ganglion ⑦, to uncover the roots of the hypoglossal nerve ⑨ and the vagus nerve ⑥ (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]J and 3K).\nPull the superior cervical ganglion ⑦ rostrally to reveal the hypoglossal nerve ⑨ and the vagus nerve ⑥ (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]L and 3M).\nDetach the hypoglossal nerve ⑨ away from the vagus nerve ⑥ using a spinal cord hook (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]N) to gain a clear view of the JNG swellings ⑩, which are located immediately adjacent to the base of the skull where the vagus nerve exits ⑥ (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]O).\nCritical: Immerse all surgical tools into saline before contacting any carotid arteries or cranial nerves. Frequently drop saline into the surgical area to maintain it hydrated.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. JNG intraganglionic injection, related to part I, step 2\nGently lower and insert the 36G beveled NanoFil needle [WPI, NF36BV-2] into the JNG swellings ⑩ with the micropositioner [Miller Design, P-10]. Then, infuse 200 nL CCK-SAP at 2 nL/s (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]P).\nClose the skin with a sterile suture and apply povidone-iodine.\nTransfer the animal into a clean cage warmed at 37°C.\nApply post-operative analgesia, carprofen, 5 mg/Kg (s.c.) twice/day for three consecutive days.",
    "Note: Dilute Carprofen stock solution (50 mg/mL) with 0.9% saline into working solution (0.5 mg/mL). Keep Carprofen stock solution under refrigeration 2°C–8°C. Diluted Carprofen should be stored refrigerated and disposed of after 30 days.\nPause Point: Suspend the vagal surgery procedure immediately upon any signs of cardiorespiratory irregularity.\nCritical: For post-operative days 1 through 7, mice (6–8 weeks old, 20–25 g) typically recover from surgery satisfactorily. The animals reaching 95% of pre-operative body weight or over, and behaving normally in their home cages without displaying any signs of pain or distress, are ready for behavioral testing and further analyses.\nPart II. Post-perfusion JNG dissection\nTiming: 3 work days\nTranscardiac perfusion.\nInduce and maintain the animal into deep anesthesia with 3% isoflurane.\nTranscardially perfuse 50 mL of a saline + heparin (10U/L) solution, followed by 50 mL ice-cold 4% PFA dissolved in PBS. Dissect the skull and cervical tissues.\nAfter 5-h post perfusion fixation in PFA, thoroughly wash the tissue with PBS. Rinse the tissue with sufficient PBS for 3 h, three times.\nJNG dissection.\nRemove excess skin and adipose tissue (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/607-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "Cut the skullcap (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B) and remove the brain and spinal cord. Keep the superior surface of the skull under scope view. Locate the suture between temporal ② and occipital bones ① (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nDiscriminate the light-colored jugular foramen ④ from the hypoglossal canal ③. Note that the vagus and hypoglossal nerves pass through the jugular foramen and the hypoglossal canal, respectively, after exiting the medulla oblongata (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nSplit the occipital bone ① along the midline, and then remove the temporal bone ② away from the occipital bone ① (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C–4E).\nExpose and dissect the vagus nerve and JNG ⑤ using Vannas spring scissors [FST, 15071-08] (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F–4I)."
