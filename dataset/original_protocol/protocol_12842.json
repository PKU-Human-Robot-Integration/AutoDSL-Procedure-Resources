    "All animals were handled in strict accordance with protocols approved by the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Setting up adult zebrafish for breeding\nUse a large cohort of adult male and female zebrafish of a single strain for breeding. There are small differences in the genetic makeup of zebrafish of even a single strain, use a large cohort to ensure results are representative of the genetic variability of the population and not restricted to a small subset of the population.\nThe night before embryos will be collected, place dozens of breeding adults into breeding tanks, use approximately equal numbers of males and females. Depending on the experiment, use one of the following breeding strategies.\n\t\nBreeding strategy 1: Place a few male and female zebrafish in individual breeding tanks, separate the males from the females with a divider. If this approach is used, setup many different breeding tanks and pool the embryos from each to ensure the biological variability is representative of the population.\nBreeding strategy 2: Combine dozens of male and female zebrafish in a large breeding tank. Use this strategy as long as there are a sufficiently large number of embryos, it is reasonable to assume they came from a variety of founders and are therefore genetically representative of the population.\n2. Timed matings - collecting, sorting, and housing zebrafish embryos for experiments\nPerform timed matings, beginning as soon as the light cycles being in the morning. Discard any embryos generated overnight.\nAllow fish to breed in shallow water (3-5 cm) for a period of 10 min, with a false bottom for embryos to escape through.",
    "After 10 min, collect embryos by pouring through a strainer and rinsing into a 10-cm plate with a wash bottle. Pool all embryos collected at the same time point, mark them with time of collection, and place immediately in an incubator at 28.5 °C.\nHundreds of embryos can be expected from a single mating pair in a day. Allow adults to breed in 10 min cycles until the number of embryos obtained is less than twenty.\nApproximately 1-1.5 h after collection, sort embryos to remove dead and unfertilized embryos. To sort embryos, remove from incubator and observe under a dissecting microscope.\n\t\nCount embryos and place at a density of 100 embryos per 10 cm plate.\nAdd fresh E3 medium (5 mM NaCl, 0.17 mM KCl, 0.33 mM CaCl2, 0.33 mM MgSO4) and return embryos to the 28.5 °C incubator.\n3. Dechorionate, deyolk, and fix zebrafish embryos\nNOTE: This section of the protocol is designed for embryos prior to 48 h post fertilization (hpf). There is no need to remove the chorions of embryos at later stages of development (after 48 hpf), as they often naturally fall off. There is no need to deyolk or remove the chorions of fish older the 5 days post fertilization (dpf).\nWhen embryos reach desired developmental age, verify appropriate stage of development morphologically under a light microscope according to \"Stages of Embryonic Development of the Zebrafish\"17.\nTransfer up to 1500 staged embryos to a 15-mL conical tube and wash several times with E3.\n\t\nAdd 1 mL of E3 and 20 µL of Pronase solution (30 mg/mL) for every 100 embryos and gently swirl. Up to 1500 embryos can be dechorionated in a single tube with 15 mL of E3.",
    "Lay tube on its side and arrange embryos in an even layer to ensure maximum surface to volume ratio. Gently agitate tube every 2-3 min until all chorions have fallen off of the embryos. The total dechorionation time will vary depending on the Pronase activity.\nRemove supernatant and gently rinse embryos 3 times with 10 mL of E3. Place embryos on ice for the remainder of this section of the protocol.\nRemove E3 and wash embryos with freshly prepared ice-cold deyolking buffer (0.5x Ginzburg Fish Ringer's solution, without calcium: 55 mM NaCl, 1.8 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaHCO3).\n\t\nAdd 1 mL of ice-cold deyolking buffer for up to 500 embryos.\nUsing a P1000, gently pipette embryos up and down 5-10 times to disrupt yolk sack.\nTransfer 1 mL to a 1.5 mL microfuge tube and centrifuge at 4 °C and 500 x g for 5 min.\nRemove supernatant and wash pellet with 1 mL of ice-cold 1x PBS (phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.0) to remove Ringer's solution. Centrifuge at 4 °C and 500 x g for 5 min.\nCarefully remove supernatant and resuspend cells in 1 mL of 1x PBS. Place tube on ice.\nAdd 3 mL of ice-cold ethanol (EtOH) to a 15-mL conical tube. Vortex tube of EtOH gently on low setting.\n\t\nUsing a P1000, slowly (1 drop per second) drip zebrafish embryo cell suspension into EtOH while vortexing gently.\nAdd a total of 1 mL of the embryo cell suspension, for a final fixation solution of 75% EtOH.",
    "After 1 mL of cell suspension has been added, gently swirl tube to mix and place at -20 °C for at least 1 h. It is recommended to place the tubes on their side to ensure maximum surface to volume ratio and reduce the number of embryos and cells that stick together. Store embryo cells at -20 °C for 2-3 weeks.\n4. Staining DNA and FACS sorting embryos\nNOTE: This section of the protocol is designed for embryos at 1 dpf.\nRemove EtOH-fixed embryo cells from -20 °C and centrifuge at 4 °C 1500 x g for 5 min.\n\t\nPlace tube on ice and carefully remove supernatant. Using a P1000, gently resuspend cells in 1 mL of freshly prepared cold PBS-BSA (1x PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin).\nCentrifuge cells at 4 °C and 1500 x g for 5 min and place on ice.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend cells in propidium iodide (PI) staining solution (50 µg/mL PI, 100 µg/mL RNase A, PBS, pH 7.0), using 200 µL for every 1000 embryos.\n\t\nAllow cells to incubate in PI solution for 30 min on ice, gently mixing every 5 min.\nPlace a 40 µm nylon cell strainer on a 50-mL conical tube on ice. Gently pipette cells to mix and filter through the mesh.\n\t\tNOTE: If multiple tubes of embryos from the same timepoint were collected in section 3 of the protocol, combine these embryos at this point so that they are all sorted together.\nUsing the flat inside end of a syringe plunger, gently disrupt any remaining clumps of cells on the mesh.\nRinse cells through the filter with 500 µL of cold PBS-BSA for every 1000 embryos.",
    "Place a 40-µm mesh over a 15-mL conical tube on ice and filter the cell suspension from the 50-mL conical tube a second time into the 15-mL tube.\nUsing an appropriate cell sorting instrument, set the laser excitation to 561-nm and emission detection to 610/20 to detect propidium iodide.\n\t\nMix 15 mL tube of stained cells briefly by vortexing and place in instrument at 4 °C.\nRun cells at a slow flow rate, ideally 1.0 mL/min, in order to obtain a clean cell cycle profile and avoid mixing G1 or G2/M cells with the S phase population.\nFirst, gate for FSC-A x SSC-A (forward scatter area by side scatter area) to remove debris (Figure 1A).\n\t\tNOTE: Cells from the embryos can be varying sizes depending on the stage and cell type. The neutral density (ND) filter may need to be switched between 1.0 and 1.5 depending on the size of cells present. Gate a large area to collect most cells and remove debris.\nSecond, gate for SSC-area (SSC-A) by PI-area (PI-A), to remove debris and cell doublets (Figure 1B).\nThird, gate for SSC-A by SSC-W (width) to remove any remaining cell doublets (Figure 1C).\nDisplay the gated populations on a histogram with cell number (count) on the y-axis and propidium iodide area (PI-A) on the x-axis. For 24 hpf embryos, this should give a stereotypical cell cycle profile as in Figure 1D.\n\t\nTo sort the S phase population, set the gate from the right side of the G1 peak to the left side of the G2 peak, including only a minimal amount of the G1 and G2 populations. For 24 hpf embryos, this will typically comprise about 10-15% of the gated population (see Figure 1D).",
    "To sort the G1 population, set the gate on the left side of the G1 peak, not to pass the top of the peak. Adjust the width of the G1 gate as narrow as possible (see Figure 1D).\nBack gate the G1 and S phase populations to ensure proper initial gating (Figure 1E).\nSort the G1 and S phase populations into 15 mL conical tubes with 3 mL of PBS-BSA. The goal should be to obtain between 500,000 and 1 million or more sorted cells per fraction (G1 and S phase).\nAfter sorting is complete, centrifuge tubes at 1500 x g and 4 °C for 10 min.\n\tNOTE: The small cell pellet will be difficult to see and it is important to avoid disrupting it, so use preferably a swinging bucket rotor over a fixed-angle rotor.\nCarefully remove supernatant and resuspend pellet with 1 mL of 1x PBS. Transfer cells to a 1.5 mL microfuge tube and centrifuge at 6,000 x g and 4 °C for 5 min.\nCarefully remove all liquid from tube and freeze dry pellet at -20 °C. Store the pellet at -20 °C for 2-3 weeks.\n5. DNA isolation, RNase treatment, and DNA purification\nRemove cell pellet from -20 °C and place on ice.\n\t\nAdd 400 µL of SDS buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl, 0.5% SDS) to pellet and resuspend.\nAdd proteinase K to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/mL and mix by vortexing briefly.\nIncubate samples at 56 °C for 2 h, vortex every 15 min.\nAfter 2 h, perform phenol-chloroform extraction by adding 400 µL of phenol-chloroform (Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamyl Alcohol 25:24:1, saturated with 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA).\n\t\nVortex for 20 s and centrifuge sample at 16,000 x g for 5 min to separate phases.",
    "Carefully remove the upper aqueous phase (400 µL) and transfer to a 1.5 mL tube.\nPerform EtOH precipitation by adding 40 µL of 3M sodium acetate (pH 5.2), 2 µL of glycogen, and 1 mL of EtOH.\n\t\nVortex to mix thoroughly and place at -20 °C overnight to precipitate DNA. Sample can also be precipitated at -80 °C or on dry ice for 1 h.\nCentrifuge sample at 4 °C and 16,000 x g for 30 min to pellet DNA.\nDiscard supernatant and wash pellet with 1 mL 70% EtOH. Centrifuge at 4 °C and 16,000 x g for 5 min.\nDiscard supernatant and air-dry pellet at ambient temperature for 2-3 min.\nDissolve pellet in 96 µL of autoclaved water, and add 4 µL of RNase A (2 mg/mL).\n\t\nMix well by vortexing and incubate at 37 °C for 1 h.\nPerform phenol-chloroform extraction by adding 100 µL of phenol-chloroform and following procedure in steps 5.2.1 - 5.2.2.\nPerform EtOH precipitation by adding 10 µL of 3M sodium acetate, 1 µL glycogen, and 250 µL of EtOH and following the procedure in steps 5.3.1 - 5.3.5.\nResuspend pellet in 60 µL of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM EDTA (pH8.0)) and determine DNA concentration using a quantitative fluorescence-based method. Store DNA at -20 °C.\n\tNOTE: It is important to quantify DNA using fluorescence-based DNA binding dyes, or other means more reliable than UV spectrometer-based methods.\n6. Preparation of DNA libraries and next generation sequencing",
    "NOTE: A G1 copy number reference sample for each biological source is required for each sequencing run (i.e. WT, mutant, transgenic, cell line, etc). Compare all S phase samples from the same biological source in the same sequencing run to the same G1 reference. Run at least two biological replicates of each sample to ensure consistency between samples.\nDilute 1 µg of DNA to a final volume of 50 µL and transfer to a specialized tube for sonication.\nShear genomic DNA for a target of 250-300 bp in a focused ultrasonicator, according to manufacturer's specifications and protocol.\nVerify quality and size of sheared genomic DNA using an automated electrophoresis machine, according to manufacturer's specifications and protocol. Ensure there is a large peak of ~250-300 bp for the sheared genomic DNA.\nPrepare sequencing libraries using a DNA library preparation kit with multiplex oligos for sequencing on Illumina platform, according to manufacturer's protocol.\nVerify quality of library prep using automated electrophoresis machine, according to manufacturer's protocol.

Use as few as 5 million mapped reads to assess replication timing for the zebrafish genome. It is recommended to start with 10-20 million reads.\nPerform paired-end 100 bp whole genome DNA sequencing of samples on a next generation sequencing platform, according to manufacturer's instructions.\n7.
