    "All animal experiments are first approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas as directed by the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8th Edition, National Research Council).\n1. Surgical Procedures and Fluid Percussion TBI\nObtain adult male 300 g Sprague-Dawley rats from a vendor and house two per cage with food and water ad libitum in a vivarium with constant conditions: light cycle (600 h to 1,800 h), temperature (21 °C to 23 °C), and humidity (40-60%).\nPrior to surgery, handle the rats for three to five days, and then train the rats for the Neuroscore, Beam-Balance, and Beam-Walk procedures from one to three days prior to baseline assessment. Conduct the baseline assessment either the day or morning prior to the surgery.\n\tNOTE: Always prepare control rats, such as sham-operated or surgically naïve rats in the same manner as those that will receive an injury and, either randomly or in a balanced manner, group the rats into the treatment groups.\nPerform surgery under aseptic conditions (sterile instruments, clean surgical gowns, sterile gloves, masks and head covers).\nAnesthetize rats using isoflurane at 4% for induction and 1.5-2% for maintenance. Intubate and mechanically ventilate the rats (using isoflurane in air:oxygen (70:30) and prepare for parasagittal fluid-percussion injury as previously described14,15.\nInfiltrate wound sites with 0.10% bupivicane prior to suturing and insert rectal acetaminophen suppository (120 mg/kg) prior to awakening from anesthesia. Monitor rats for at least 4 h during the recovery period and the following day for signs of infection, severe neurological injury (e.g. paralysis) or severe discomfort (e.g. persistent dormouse position).\n\tNOTE: Rats exhibiting any of these symptoms should be euthanized (4% isoflurane in an anesthetic chamber followed by decapitation).",
    "2. Neuroscore Training and Testing\nNeuroscore training\nFor training on rats known to be experimentally naïve, run through the tests in the following order (steps 2.2.1-2.2.5) from start to finish, return to home cage for 1 min, then repeat until a score of zero is achieved.\nMark scores on the score sheet for a record of the training trials for each rat. After training, perform one test session (see below) on the same or following day.\n\t\tNOTE: If the test session does not produce a zero score for the baseline, training and testing may be repeated or the rat may be diverted to a non-behavior experiment.\nNeuroscore testing\n\tNOTE: Run through the tests in the following order, return to home cage for 1 min, then repeat twice for a total of three times.\n\t\nForelimb flexion test\nLift the rat by the tail and hold about 6 - 12 inches above the table surface.\nObserve whether the rat extends or flexes forelimbs. Score the presence of flexion (1) or absence (0).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Flexion is abnormal. Possible score of 1 x 3 = 3 (Total possible = 3).\nHindlimb flexion test\nLift the rat by the tail and hold about 6 - 12 inches above the table surface.\nObserve whether the rat extends or flexes hindlimbs. Score the presence of flexion (1) or absence (0).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Flexion is abnormal. Possible score of 1 x 3 = 3 (Cumulative Total possible = 6).\nVisually triggered placing test\nLift the rat by the tail.\nSlowly lower the rat toward the edge of the table until the nose is about 10 cm from the edge.\nMove the rat slowly toward the edge (do not allow the whiskers to touch the edge).",
    "Observe whether the rat reaches and extends forepaws towards the table. Score the presence (0) or absence (1) of extending forepaws.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Reaching for the table in response to visual cues is normal. Possible score of 1 x 3 = 3 (Cumulative Total possible = 9).\nContact triggered placing test\nHold the rat, with body in hand, parallel to table edge and forelegs free.\nSlowly lower the rat toward the edge of table until the whiskers on one side touch the edge of the table.\nObserve whether the rat extends the forelimb on the same side as the whiskers that are touching the table toward the table edge as soon as the whiskers touch.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Elicitation of this response takes considerable practice and researchers need to be well-trained to perform this test consistently.\nScore the presence (0) or absence (1) of reaching toward the table.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Reaching in response to tactile stimulation is normal. Possible score of 1 x 3 = 3 (Total possible = 12).\nRepeat steps 2.2.4.1-2.2.4.4 for the opposite side. Possible score of 1 x 3 = 3 (Cumulative Total possible = 15).\nHindpaw grasping reflex test\nHold the rat in the one hand with thumb and index finger around the chest under the forelimbs.\nGently touch the palm of the one hindpaw with the other forefinger.\nObserve whether the rat grasps the forefinger. Score the presence (0) or absence (1) of grasping.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Grasping is normal. Possible score of 1 x 3 = 3 (Total possible = 18).\nRepeat steps 2.2.5.1-2.2.5.3 for the opposite side. Possible score of 1 x 3 = 3 (Total possible = 21).\nScoring\nSum the scores for a possible cumulative total of 7 x 3 = 21. A score of zero is normal.\n3. Beam-Balance Training and Testing\nEquipment",
    "Use a beam 60 cm in length, 1.75 cm in width, 4.0 cm in height, set 90 cm off the floor, with a barrier 30 cm in height, 30 cm in width. Secure the beam to a table with the barrier attached so that 50 cm of the beam protrudes from the barrier, away from the table.\nPlace a cushioned safety box under the beam to soften the impact of rats that fall.\nBeam-Balance training\nAt 24-48 h before surgery, place the rat on the beam for a 60 s trial.\nIf the rat fails to balance on its own, allow the rat to fall into the safety box.\nBegin timing when the rat is securely positioned on the beam.\nObserve the rat for the 60 s period and rate its performance based on the following scale: 1 = Shows stable balance (grooms, walks, attempts to climb the barrier), 2 = Shows shaky balance (grasps sides of beam and/or has unsteady movements), 3 = Tries to balance but slips or spins on the beam, hangs on by hugging the beam, 4 = Tries to balance, but falls after 10 s, 5 = Hangs over or from the beam and falls off in under 10 s, 6 = Falls off, making no effort to balance or hang onto the beam.\nRecord the score on the worksheet.\nAllow the rat to rest for 15 s in home cage, then repeat steps 3.2.1-3.2.5 until the rat achieves three scores of 1 or 2. The rat is then considered trained.\nPerform one pre-assessment at 24 h or on the day of surgery prior to surgery.\nBeam-Balance testing\nStarting 24 h after surgery and continuing for up to 4 days, test the rats daily.",
    "Place the rat on the beam and start the timer. Observe the rat closely for 60 s. Record the score on the worksheet.\nReturn the rat to the home cage for a brief rest period (1-3 min).\nRepeat steps 3.3.1.1-3.3.1.2 for a total of three tests.\n4. Beam-Walk Training and Testing\nEquipment\nUse a wooden beam 100 cm in length, 2.5 cm in width, and 4.0 cm in height.\nPrepare an adjustable stand, an adjustable table, and four pegs, 2 cm in height, and a black goal box 28 cm in length, 18 cm in height, and 18 cm in width, with an opening on one end large enough for the rat to pass through.\nAttach the target end of the beam to the open side of the goal box that is placed on the adjustable table. Place the bright light and white noise generator near the starting end of the beam. The starting end of the beam is fixed to the adjustable stand so the beam and box are at the same level, about 1 m above the floor.\nBeam-Walk training\nStart training 24-48 h before surgery.\nPlace the rat in the goal box for 1 min. After 1 min, remove the rat and start the trial.\nTo start the trial, turn on the light and white noise and place the rat on the beam at the location of the peg hole closest to the goal box and allow the rat to enter the goal box.\nWhen the rat's front feet cross the threshold of the goal box, immediately turn off the light and noise sources (this is the end of one trial).\nAllow the rat to rest in the goal box for 30 s between each trial.",
    "Repeat the procedure in step 4.2.3-4.2.5 twice at each peg location and from the starting position. Insert the pegs in the holes and run one complete Beam-Walk with the pegs in place.\nRun three timed Beam-Walk trials.\n\t\t\nRemove the rat from the goal box. Turn on the light and white noise and start the stopwatch when placing the rat on the beam. Stop the stop watch immediately when the rat's front feet cross the threshold of the goal box, and then immediately turn off the light and noise.\nRecord the time on the worksheet.\nRepeat steps 4.2.7.1-4.2.7.2 until the rat has achieved three times of 5 s or less. The rat is now considered trained.\nBeam-Walk baseline assessment\nOn the day or morning prior to surgery, do three timed trials with pegs in place.\nStart by placing the rat in the goal box for 30 s. Remove the rat from the goal box and turn on the white noise and light. Place the rat on the start end of the beam and simultaneously start the stop watch. When the rat's front feet cross the threshold of the goal box, immediately turn off the light and noise sources and stop the timer.\nRecord the time on the worksheet. Allow the rat to remain in the goal box for 30 s.\nRepeat steps 4.3.2-4.3.3 until three latencies are recorded on the worksheet. Return the rat to the home cage after three timed trials are completed.\nBeam-Walk testing\nTest the rats daily starting 24 h after surgery and continuing for up to 4 days. Perform three timed trials as in steps 4.3.\n5. Working Memory Water Maze\nEquipment\nUse a tank filled with water to a height of 28 cm and maintained at 26 ± 1 °C.",
    "Use a clear acrylic glass platform that is 10 cm in diameter on a stand 26 cm in height.\n\t\tNOTE: The top surface of the platform should be coated with silicon in the shape of a circle with an X across it. This allows the rats to climb up onto the platform and gives them traction so they do not slip off.\nGather a stopwatch, a heat lamp, disposable towels, absorbent pads, extra cages, and a small, long-handled aquarium fish net. Use a computerized video tracking system that is connected to a video camera to record the rat swimming and send the data to the computer. Save the video and data on the computer for later analysis.\nWorking memory water maze testing\nGive the rats four pairs of trials each day for five consecutive days, place the platform in each of the four quadrants and start the rats from each of the four starting points (N, S, E, W) as described below.\nFirst define the starting location-platform pairs to be used throughout the experiment.\n\t\tNOTE: The order of the quadrants where the platform is located and the starting point used needs to be in a different order for each of the five days of swimming, but the same for each rat.\n\t\t\nUse four starting points (N, S, E, or W) and four platform locations (Quadrants 1, 2, 3, or 4; Figure 1). For example, (N, 2; E, 4; S, 1; W, 3; see Figure 1). Plan a balanced order (not random) to avoid starting points too close to the platforms (No starting point is the same quadrant as the platform location). Set up a data sheet using the platform quadrants and four starting points.",
    "Write a protocol for the video tracking software to use in order to video the rats swimming and to collect specified data (e.g., duration of swim, speed, distance traveled before finding the platform).\n\t\t\tNOTE: The tracking software will automatically stop recording after the specified duration. The protocol should allow for specifying where the platform is placed, how many trials to run per animal, and how many animals will be tested per session, and also the maximum duration allowed (e.g., 120 s).\nTest 4-6 rats per session.\n\t\t\tNOTE: More than 6 rats create an issue in the timing between rats and can lead to error by the handler. The warming boxes also become crowded.\nTrial 1\nOpen the video tracking software and load the correct protocol including the water maze map.\nPlace the platform in the assigned location (e.g., 2; Figure 1) and check that it matches the map in the software. Prepare the tracking software to start when the rat enters the field of view of the video camera.\nPlace the rat in the tank facing the wall at the assigned location (e.g., N; Figure 1) and immediately start the timer.\nAllow the rat 120 s to find the platform. When the rat finds the platform, stop the timer and record the time on the worksheet. If the rat fails to find the platform, lead it to the platform by hand and record 120 s. Allow the rat 15 s to remain on the platform.\nTrial 2\nCheck that the software is ready for Trial 2. Place the rat back in the tank at the same starting position (N). Repeat step 5.2.3.4.",
    "After Trial 2, place the rat in the heated enclosure for 4 min. Move the platform to the second location (4; Figure 1), and check that it matches the map in the software.\nRepeat Trial 1 and 2 procedures (steps 5.2.3-5.2.4) until all four starting location/platform pairings are completed.\n6. Data Analysis\nNeuroscore\nManually transfer the handwritten results to a computer spreadsheet.\nSum the results for each trial to obtain three scores per rat on each day.\nFormat the data for statistical analysis (either in the long or wide format depending on the software preference).\n\t\tNOTE: The long format has a single column for treatment (in this case, populated with either \"Naïve\", \"Sham\", or \"TBI\"), a single column for day (in this case \"0\", \"1\", \"2\" or \"3\"), and a single column for trial (either \"1\", \"2\" or \"3\"). The wide format has a single column for each combination of factor levels (so a single column for Naïve, day 0, trial 1, another column for Naïve, day 0, trial 2, etc.)\nAverage the score for each animal on each day. Since there were three trials done on each day there will be three values for each animal per day.\nAssess whether the data are normally distributed. Use a nonparametric statistical (e.g., the Kruskal-Wallis) test to analyze whether the score on each day is different between groups. In this case, since these data are not continuous, they are not normally distributed.\nTo determine where the differences lie, do post-hoc tests, such as the Tukey's post-hoc analysis.\n\t\tNOTE: Here, the R statistical software package16, the Kruskal.test() function and the posthoc.kruskal.nemenyi.test function within the Pairwise Multiple Comparison of Mean Ranks Package (PMCMR)17 were used.\nAdditionally, test to see if there are any differences between days within each group.",
    "NOTE: For example, to see if the SHAM animals behave differently on Day 0 compared to Day 1, Day 2, or Day 3. To do this, run a one-way repeated measures ANOVA. This can be accomplished in R using the ezANOVA function within the ez package.\nTo run a repeated measures ANOVA, first check the assumption about sphericity.\n\t\tNOTE: Here, the data indicate that the within factor (Day) does meet the sphericity assumption for NAÏVE and SHAM, but not for TBI. Thus, a correction is not necessary for NAÏVE or SHAM. For the TBI data, use the Greenhouse-Geisser correction.\nIf significant differences are found, run a post-hoc test to determine where the differences lie. This is achieved in R using the pairwise t-test function. Plot the results as a box plot, as shown in the representative results (Figure 2).\nBeam-Balance\nManually transfer the handwritten scores to a computer spreadsheet. Format the data for statistical analysis (either in long or wide format depending on the software preference). See Note in step 6.1.3.\nAverage the scores for each rat on each day so that each rat will have one score per day. To test whether the score on each day is different between NAÏVE, SHAM, and TBI, assess whether the data are normally distributed.\n\t\tNOTE: In this case, since the data are not continuous, these data are not normally distributed. Therefore, use a nonparametric statistical test (e.g., the Kruskal-Wallis test).\nTo determine where the differences lie, do post-hoc tests, e.g., Tukey's post-hoc analysis. To test for differences between days within each treatment group, run a one-way repeated measures ANOVA (see step 6.1.7). Check the assumption about sphericity.",
    "NOTE: In this study, the data indicate that the within factor (Day) does not meet the sphericity assumption for any of the groups, so used continuity corrections. Use the Greenhouse-Grier continuity correction.\nPlot the results on a box plot as shown in the representative results (Figure 3).\nBeam-walk\nManually transfer handwritten results to a computer spreadsheet. Average the three Beam-Walk latencies for each animal for each day. Format the data for statistical analysis (see step 6.1.3).\nAssess whether the data is normally distributed.\n\t\tNOTE: In this case, the data is continuous, and is normally distributed. Therefore, use a one-way ANOVA to determine if the latency on each day is different between Naïve, SHAM, and TBI.\nTo see if there is any difference between days within a treatment group, run a one-way repeated measures ANOVA. First check the assumption about sphericity.\n\t\tNOTE: In this study, the data indicate that the within factor (Day) does not meet the sphericity assumption for any of our groups, so continuity corrections are used. Use the Greenhouse-Grier correction.\nPlot the results on a box plot as shown in the representative results (Figure 4).\nWorking memory water maze\nTransfer the data from the worksheet or computer tracking program to a spreadsheet. Select the outcomes to be analyzed.\n\t\tNOTE: Many possible outcomes are available for analysis from computer tracking programs. Examples of outcomes selected for analysis may include: latency, path length, thigmotaxia, and swim speed. The most commonly reported outcome is latency, as used in the provided example.\nFormat the data for statistical analysis (either in long or wide format depending on the software preference).",
    "NOTE: The long format has a single column for treatment (in this case, populated with either \"Naïve\", \"Sham\", or \"TBI\"), a single column for day (in this case \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", or \"5\") and a single column for trial (either \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", or \"8\"). We also need an additional column to identify the attempt (either \"1\" or \"2\"). Wide format has a single column for each combination of factor levels (so for example, a single column for Naïve, day 1, trial 1, attempt 1, another column for Naïve, day 1, trial 2, attempt 2). Also, the difference between Trial 1 and Trial 2 can be calculated for each session and analyzed as a difference score.\nTo find if there is an overall difference between the injury groups, perform the following steps.\n\t\t\nFirst, average the water maze latency for each animal for Day 1.\n\t\t\tNOTE: There were four sessions on each day, so average the four values per animal for each of Trial 1 and Trial 2. Do this calculation for the remaining days as well.\nTo check for injury differences overall, run a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. There are two factors, injury and day. Injury is a between group factor and day is a within group factor. Note: Here R was used.\nIf the results indicate a significant difference due to Injury, then run a Tukey's post-hoc test to see where the differences lie.\nTo find out whether there are differences between the injury groups on specific days perform the following steps.",
    "NOTE: Day 1 is used as an example, and the same analysis needs to be done for all the following days. Also, this analysis is done in several ways, first for Trial 1 only, second for Trial 2 only, and third for the difference between Trial 1 and Trial 2. Trial 1 is used as an example; the same steps need to be used for the other analyses.\n\t\t\nFirst, average the water maze latency for each animal for Day 1. Since there were four repetitions of \"Trial 1\" on each day, average the four values for each animal.\nAssess whether the data is normally distributed.\n\t\t\tNOTE: In this case, the data is continuous, and is normally distributed. Therefore, use the one-way ANOVA to determine if the water maze latency on Day 1 is different between NAÏVE, SHAM, and TBI. R statistical software package and the aov() function were used here.\nUse a 5% level of significance. If the resulting p-value is less than 0.05, then there are significant differences between the groups.\nTo determine where those differences lie, use the Tukey's post-hoc test. This is the TukeyHSD() function in R.\nTo find out if there are differences between days within treatment groups, follow these steps.\n\t\t\nFirst, run a one-way repeated measures ANOVA. This can be accomplished in R using the ezANOVA function within the ez package.\nBefore running a repeated measures ANOVA, first check the assumption about sphericity.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The within factor (Day) meets the sphericity assumption for all of the groups, thus there is no need to use continuity corrections.\nIf differences between days are found (p-values less than 0.05), then run a post-hoc test to determine exactly where the differences lie. This step is achieved in R using the pairwise.t.test function.",
