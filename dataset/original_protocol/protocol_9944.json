    "All experiments were performed in accordance with the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and were approved by the Medical University of South Carolina Animal Care and Use Committee under protocol ID 00399.\n1. Cell Culture\nGenerate human retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19) cell line stably expressing the gene of choice according to published protocols14,15.\nMaintain cells in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nReplace the medium every 2–3 days.\nPassage the cells after reaching 70%–80% confluence using standard tissue culture procedures.\n2. Cell Encapsulation\nMix sodium alginate with deionized (DI) water for a final concentration of 2% w/v and purify by filtration with a 0.2 µm sterile syringe filter.\nPrepare the cells to be mixed with the alginate solution by trypsinizing, centrifuging, and washing them with 10 mM HEPES buffered saline solution (pH = 7.4). Using a hemocytometer, count the cells and adjust the final cell concentration to 1 x 106 in alginate solution.\nNOTE: The encapsulation process should be run inside a sterilized hood.\nLoad ~300 µL aliquots of alginate and cells mixture into a 3 mL syringe and attach it to a syringe pump. The solution will be pumped through a 30 G blunt tip needle to a sterile gelling bath placed in a sterile 50 mL beaker below the syringe tip at 7 mm for a needle to bath spraying distance.\nThe gelling bath contains a volume of 40 mL of 10 mM HEPES buffered saline containing 100 mM calcium chloride (CaCl2) and 0.5% w/v poly-L-ornithine (PLO). The PLO is a secondary polymer coating that can be omitted or changed according to the needs of the investigator.",
    "Adjust the voltage and flow rate and keep them both constant during the encapsulation process at 60 mm/h flow rate and 6.0 kV initial voltage to produce microcapsules size of ~150 µm.\nConnect the clip of anode wire (red) of a high voltage generator needle tip to the needle and connect the ground clip (black) to the copper wire that is halfway submerged in the gelling bath. One batch of the alginate + cell mixture (1 mL) takes approximately 30 min to prepare the encapsulated cells (approximately 25,000 microcapsules).\nWash the formed microcapsules containing cells with washing solution (10 mM HEPES buffered saline containing 1.5 mM CaCl2, pH = 7.4) twice. Do not use PBS for washing.\nIncubate the encapsulated cells with 10% FBS supplemented DMEM media in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nNOTE: Encapsulation process instruments are depicted in Figure 1.\n3. Confirmation that Encapsulation Does Not Affect Cell Viability\nAfter incubating the encapsulated cells for 24 h in media, prepare a small sample of 500 µL (~30 microcapsules) for staining.\nWash the microcapsules 2x using washing solution (10 mM HEPES buffered saline containing 1.5 mM CaCl2) and stain them for live-dead viability using a live/dead assay kit.\nPrepare a staining mixture of calcein AM (acetoxymethyl) and ethidium homodimer-1 at final concentrations of 2 µM and 4 µM, respectively.\nAdd 2 mL of the staining mixture to the encapsulated cells and incubate for 30–45 min in the dark at room temperature (RT).\nWith careful aspiration, aspirate the staining solution and wash the microcapsules 2x with the washing solution. Use a fluorescent microscope system to observe and image the encapsulated cells.\nNOTE: Documentation of encapsulation is depicted in Figure 2.\n4. Confirmation That Capsules Are the Appropriate Size for Delivery and Delivery of the Biologic",
    "Intravitreal injections in a mouse eye are typically performed with a 27 G blunt-tip needle (inner diameter of 210 µm) attached to a 2.5 µL Hamilton syringe.\nGenerate capsules ranging from 100 to 200 µm, dilute them in serum-free media, and carefully pull them up into the Hamilton syringe. PBS is not a suitable vehicle, as alginate capsules will dissolve in PBS.\nSlowly eject 1 µL drops containing capsules onto a microscope slide and determine their integrity using an upright bright-field microscope.\nAdjust the capsule size (see step 2.3) by adjusting voltage and flow rate accordingly. Smaller microcapsules are produced in a nonlinear fashion by increasing voltage and slightly decreasing flow rate8. In our hands, capsules of 150 µm in diameter proved to be most suitable. Adjustment of capsule size is also dependent on keeping the alginate concentration constant while changing the other parameters.\nMaintain a separate set of cells in capsules of the appropriate size in serum-free medium to determine the amount of secretion of the desired biologic. Use sensitive ELISAs or western blotting to determine the concentration of the biologics in the supernatant.\nDetermine the required amount of capsules that need to be injected based on the known PK/PD (pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics) of the therapeutic. In our hands, 10 capsules per mouse eye proved to be most efficacious.\n5. Capsule Delivery into Mouse Vitreous\nPerform intravitreal injections using a dissecting microscope. See Figure 3 for surgical set-up and materials used during the procedure. A detailed protocol for intravitreous injections can be found elsewhere16.\nAnesthetize mice by intraperitoneal injection of xylazine and ketamine (20 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg) or other preferred anesthetics approved by the specific institution’s Animal Care and Use Committee. Ensure the appropriate depth of anesthesia using a toe pinch17.",
    "Dilate the mouse pupils with phenylephrine HCL (2.5%) and atropine sulfate (1%) to allow for good visibility of the vitreous chamber and apply a lubricant eye gel to the eyes to keep them hydrated during the procedure.\nPuncture the sclera at the limbus with a 26 G needle as the guide hole, making sure that 1) the needle is at a 45° angle with the eye and table and 2) the beveled tip is pointed upwards to avoid puncturing the lens.\nCarefully inject the capsules using a 27 G blunt-tip needle attached to a Hamilton syringe at a 45° angle under visual inspection, making sure to avoid touching the lens with the needle. Injury of the lens will lead to cataract formation. The capsules should be visible in the vitreous using the dissecting microscope (Figure 4A).\nAfter retraction of the needle, treat the injection site with antibiotic ointments neomycin and polymyxin B sulfates in addition to dexamethasone ophthalmic antibiotic ointment.\nApply goniotaire hypromellose demulcent ophthalmic solution (2.5%) to both eyes to prevent the corneas from drying out during the recovery period.\nPlace the mouse on a heating pad held at 37°C and monitor until fully awake.\nA successful injection of encapsulated ARPE-19 cells should reveal the presence of intact capsules in the vitreous chamber of the mouse with only minor amounts of debris when imaging the eye by optical coherence tomography or other methods (Figure 4B).\nThe injected mouse eye, after a few days of recovery due to the surgery, is now ready for the experimental paradigm at hand.\nNOTE: The surgical set-up and documentation of capsules in the eye are depicted in Figure 3 and Figure 4, respectively.\nSubscription Required.
