    "​All studies described in this article were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Allegheny Health Network. All patients provided informed consent before the administration of sedative agents and were de-identified by being assigned a study number.\n1. Bedside Collection\nNOTE: Everything in this protocol should be done on ice, using pre-chilled solutions. It is important to induce cold stasis in the cells to preserve their in situ biological phenotype. This protocol involves the handling of blood and cells obtained from humans and therefore universal precautions should be observed.\nAfter withdrawal of the catheter from the sheath, immediately immerse the catheter in a 50 mL centrifuge tube containing 40 mL of chilled sterile saline. Swirl the catheter several times to remove blood, and flush the line if necessary to remove blood retained within the line.\nCut off the distal 5 cm of the cath tip and allow it to fall into the 50 mL centrifuge tube containing chilled saline. Immediately remove the cath tip with forceps and transfer it to a 15 mL centrifuge tube containing 15 mL of endothelial cell (EC) growth medium.\nSeal the tube, place it on ice and transfer to the lab to prepare for processing or shipping. It is critical that the balloon stays immersed in medium, so make sure there is minimal headspace in the 15 mL tube by filling it completely with EC growth medium.\nProcess the sample immediately by proceeding to Step 2.1 or seal and ship the sample on wet ice overnight for processing at a laboratory skilled in this protocol. If cells are ultimately going to be used for cell culture, it is strongly recommend that the cath tip be immediately processed at the same site at which it was collected.\n2.Cell Harvest",
    "NOTE: Everything in this protocol should be done on ice, using pre-chilled solutions. The cells are in cold stasis, and it is important to avoid awakening them until they are ready to be fixed or cultured. This entire protocol should be performed in a laminar flow hood, using sterile instruments, if the ultimate intent is culture of the harvested PAECs. If culture is not planned (e.g., flow cytometry analysis), it is not necessary to observe sterile precautions.\nAdd 5 mL of cell detachment solution to a 15 mL centrifuge tube; place on ice.\nDraw 1 mL of EC media from that remaining in the bedside collection tube into the 1 mL syringe.\nQuickly complete steps 2.3 through 2.5. Grip the cut end of the catheter tip with hemostats.\nCarefully insert the needle of the 1 mL syringe into the \"white\" hole opposite the guide wire (\"black hole\"). Take great care to avoid injury with the needle.\nTransfer the cath tip into the 15 mL centrifuge tube containing the cell detachment solution.\nInflate the balloon, being careful not to burst it; inflating the balloon with approximately 200 µL of media works well.\nAllow the catheter to sit in cell detachment solution on ice for 5 min with the balloon inflated. If the balloon deflates on its own during the 5 min incubation, this is acceptable.\nPour the contents of the 15 mL centrifuge tube into the 100 mm dish. Place the balloon in the cell detachment solution \"puddle\".",
    "Scrape the inflated balloon with a cell scraper. The cell scraper can be drawn around the balloon in a circular motion or a brushing motion. Focus on the \"poles\" of the balloon, where it meets the catheter. Ensure that the cell scraper contacts the entire surface of the balloon at least twice. Rinse the cell scraper in the cell detachment solution \"puddle\" periodically.\nDeflate the balloon and scrape it with a brushing motion. Rinse the cell scraper in the cell detachment solution \"puddle\".\nDiscard the cath tip, needle and cell scraper in the appropriate waste container.\nPour the cell detachment solution containing the cell harvest into a 50 mL centrifuge tube. Shake the collection tube and pour the remaining media from the collection tube into the collected sample as well.\nCentrifuge the sample at 650 x g at 4 °C for 10 min. It is important to note that oftentimes a pellet will NOT be seen. It can be helpful to mark the location where a pellet would be seen, if visible, to avoid aspirating the pellet in the event it is too small to be seen.\nNOTE: Normally, a pellet is only seen when the sample has been contaminated by blood. Blood contamination is immaterial to the ultimate harvest product because blood fails to bind the CD146 beads and washes through the column. Extensive testing has demonstrated that the specific brand of 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes referenced in the Table of Materials minimizes cell loss relative to other tubes utilized during protocol optimization.\nCarefully aspirate media, and avoid disturbing or aspirating the pellet.\n3. Cell Purification",
    "NOTE: Everything in this protocol should be done on ice, using pre-chilled solutions. The cells are in cold stasis, and it is important to avoid awakening them until they are ready to be fixed or cultured.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL of chilled red blood cell lysis solution, and transfer it to a 1.5 mL microfuge tube; gently rock for 10 min at 4 °C.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 500 x g and 4 °C. Aspirate the RBC lysis solution.\nResuspend the pellet in 60 μL of PBS, 20 μL of FcR blocker, and 20 μL of anti-human CD146 microbeads. Incubate for 15 min at 4 °C.\nAdd 1 mL of chilled PBS. Centrifuge for 5 min at 500 x g and 4 °C. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of chilled PBS.\nPlace a magnetic LS column on a magnetic rack (see Table of Materials for specific commercial identities of these items) at room temperature. Prime column by adding 1 mL of PBS and allow the entire volume to flow through. Discard the flow-through.\nPlace the sample in the magnetic column. Discard the flow-through.\nWash column with 3 mL of chilled PBS three times. Discard the flow-through from each wash.\nAdd 3 mL of chilled PBS to a 15 mL centrifuge tube. Remove the magnetic column from magnet, pour the 3 mL of PBS from the 15 mL centrifuge tube into the column and quickly place the column in the centrifuge tube to catch the flow-through. Immediately plunge with the plunger supplied with column. The sample is now purified, ready for fixation/staining, or culture."
