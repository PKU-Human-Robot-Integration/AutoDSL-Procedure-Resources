    "Creation of MNX miceimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161012/20161012180633_5207.jpgFigure 1. Overall procedure schematic. MNX mice were produced by enucleating fertilized oocytes from 'Strain A' (C57BL/6) and 'Strain B' (C3H/HeN) mice. MNX nomenclature is indicated by strain nuclear (Strainn):strain mtDNA (Strainmt), e.g., mice with C3H nuclear DNA and C57 mtDNA are indicated by C3Hn:C57mt. Strain B pronuclei were transferred to enucleated Strain A oocytes yielding Strain Bn:Strain Amt (C3Hn:C57mt) oocytes, which were implanted into surrogate females to generate MNX progeny. The reciprocal process was followed to generate the Strain An:Strain Bmt (C57n:C3Hmt) oocytes.Female donor mice are injected intraperitoneally (IP) with PMS (5.0-7.5 IU, in a volume 0.2-0.3 ml) using a 26 gauge needle and a 1 or 3 ml syringe. Optimum dose and age of the mice can be strain specific, and should be determined via dose response curves with assessment of fertilized embryo production. Typically, female mice are injected ~noon on day 1.Approximately 48 h after (day 3) the PMS injection, donor mice receive an IP injection of HCG of the same dose as PMS. Immediately following injection, super-ovulated females are paired and mated with proven breeder males of the same nuclear genotype (matching the female, Figure 1); often copulation occurs within the first 1-2 h of mating. Female recipient mice positive for signs of proestrus by visual inspection are paired with proven vasectomized males to generate pseudopregnancy (Byers et al., 2012).Females are checked the following morning for vaginal plugs. The presence of a plug indicates successful mating, but does not necessarily indicate fertilization. The absence of a plug does not however confirm that successful breeding did not occur since facile identification of plugs can be strain dependent.Cumulus masses are harvested as previously described to produce single-celled embryos (Figures 2A and 2B) (Han et al., 2010).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161012/20161012180956_0558.jpgFigure 2. Collection of cumulus masses from oviducts.",
    "Oviducts (A) are dissected from superovulated females with vaginal plugs. The swollen ampulla (indicated by arrow) is nicked to allow the embryos and cumulus cells to be expelled (B).Pronuclear embryos are placed by mouth pipette in M2 medium containing cytochalasin B (5 μg/ml) and colcemid (0.1 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 5 min, and remain in a microinjection drop of M2 medium on a microscope slide at room temperature to prevent lysis during manipulation.A micropipette similar in size and shape to a beveled pipet used for embryonic stem cell injections (approximately 20 micron inner diameter) is used to remove both pronuclei of each embryo by applying slight pressure on the zona pellucida of the first embryo (Longenecker and Kulkarni, 2009). A high-intensity piezo pulse is applied only until the zona is ruptured (approximately 1-2 sec) and then turned off. The pipet is slowly advanced to each pronucleus (Figure 3), and with gentle suction applied to the needle using a CellTram vario syringe, the two pronuclei are aspirated and removed as a single unit (karyoplast, Figure 3). Appropriate needle size and application of suction only when the pronuclei are in contact with the needle minimizes uptake of cytoplasmic contents into the needle.The procedure is repeated on the reciprocal embryo, resulting in the pipet containing pronuclei from both strains (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161012/20161012181139_0628.jpgFigure 3. Isolation of pronuclei. (A) The pipet is slowly advanced to each pronucleus (indicated by black arrows), and with gentle suction applied to the needle using a CellTram vario syringe (B) the two pronuclei are aspirated and removed (C) as a single unit (karyoplast, K). ZP, zona pellucida.The isolated pronuclei from Strain A are implanted into the enucleated embryo of Strain B (Figure 4). The reciprocal karyoplasts from Strain B are placed into the enucleated Strain A embryos.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161012/20161012181256_8289.jpgFigure 4.",

Strain A and Strain B embryos are placed in separate dishes. An electrode is placed into the drop positioning the embryo between the two poles. A single 90 V pulse is applied to each re-constructed zygote and all zygotes are cultured overnight (Han et al., 2010).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161012/20161012181415_7183.jpgFigure 5. Embryo culture dish. Panels 1-8 are different drops of M2 medium and mineral oil containing reconstructed zygotes. Each drop may contain 1-2 zygotes.Two-cell embryos are transferred to the ostia of oviducts of 0.5 day pseudopregnant mice to term; approximately 20 embryos are transferred per recipient (Figure 6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161012/20161012181522_8764.jpgFigure 6.

Two cell embryos are placed into the oviduct of a pseudopregnant recipient mouse through the infundibular ostium by mouth pipet.Nuclear genotype and mtDNA haplotype are verified in offspring via nuclear SNP and complete mtDNA genome sequence analysis from ear or tail clips.MNX mouse colony establishmentMNX mouse colonies are established using homoplasmic founder female MNX mice based upon PCR analysis specific for each potential mtDNA haplotype. mtDNA haplotype is initially confirmed by PCR detection methods developed specifically for each haplotype and homoplasmic females confirmed by sequencing. Desired homoplasmic (based upon PCR screening) females to be used as founders are identified in ~20%-30% of generated females.",
    "MNX females of verified mtDNA sequence and apparent homoplasmy (using ear or tail clip DNA) are crossed with males of the matching nuclear background to generate F1 litters.Multiple tissues from F1 progeny are tested to verify desired mtDNA haplotype/homoplasmy via PCR analysis designed specifically for diagnostic mtDNA SNP’s (Bayona-Bafaluy et al., 2003). For example, F1 C57n:C3Hmt and C3Hn:C57mt mice were haplogrouped in multiple tissues based upon a PCR detection method to interrogate the potential for heteroplasmy (Figure 7).

Generation of Mitochondrial-nuclear eXchange (MNX) mice. Nuclear genotyping and mtDNA haplotyping of all originating founding females and F1 progeny was determined by nuclear SNP analysis of a panel of 38 distinguishing nuclear SNPs and complete sequencing of the mtDNA.",
    "After initial mtDNA haplotype verification by direct sequencing for founders, subsequent generations are haplotyped via restriction enzyme length polymorphism analysis using AspI and BclI which give patterns distinct for C3H and C57 mtDNAs. A. PCR products from C57 mtDNAs remain uncut (204 bp) whereas C3H mtDNAs are cleaved by BclI to yield 166 bp and 38 bp fragments. B. PCR products from C57 mtDNAs are cleaved by AspI to yield 274 bp and 111 bp fragments whereas C3H mtDNAs remain uncut (385 bp).MNX female founders that produced mice which appear homoplasmic in all tested tissues are then used as founding dams for each respective MNX colony.All progeny of each generation are mtDNA haplogrouped using PCR based techniques to verify maintenance of desired genetic background."
