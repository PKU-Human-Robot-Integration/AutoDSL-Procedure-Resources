    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nDay 1 Fresh Tumor Sample Preparation, EGF Ligand Uptake, and Fixation\nTiming: 1–2 h\nTumor samples are cut, washed in serum free media to remove serum before incubation with and without EGF-Alexa Fluor488.\nTumor samples collected and transferred to research laboratory (Refer to “Before you Begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]” and “Graphical Abstract”).\nOptional: This technique can also be used to assay monoclonal antibody uptake in human tissue or mouse xenograft tissue e.g., Anti-EGFR or anti-PD-L1 uptake in xenografts (Chew et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Human or mouse xenografts are excised and transferred to research laboratory as soon as possible. Within 30 min as maximal time, 15 min preferred.\nSlice the transverse sections of unfixed tumors into pieces of approximately 2 × 2 × 0.5–1.0 mm using sterile surgical scalpels (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) (Joseph et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). If available, keep matched normal tissue as control and treat under similar conditions.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/164-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Method Illustrating the Live Tumor Uptake\nSchematic representation of the processing method illustrated in Joseph et al. (2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Three live unfixed tumor biopsies (A, step 1) were dissected to select for tumor only (B). Note that surrounding normal matched tissue (A and B) can be kept for control normal tissue for comparison. Tumor samples were further dissected into multiple smaller lumps (approximately 2 × 2 × 0.5–1.0 mm, C, step 2). Multiple lumps were incubated in each EGF uptake assay condition in Eppendorf tubes (as specified in step 5 of the protocol) and then mounted onto concave glass slides (D, step 21).\nIf it is a large tumor sample, some tumor pieces may be washed as per below (no treatments) and fixed in 4% PFA overnight (8–14 h), for sectioning at a later stage.",
    "Cut as many smaller sections as possible as it is recommended that multiple tumor sections be used in each condition (as listed below in step 5). Multiple tumor sections should be randomized into each condition to allow assessment of potential variation within the tumor samples.\nCritical: Appropriate PPE to be worn and appropriate safety precautions taken when dealing with live unfixed human or mouse tissues.\nWash tumor samples 3× in 5-min washes with serum-free media (Ham’s F-12 media: DMEM) at 4°C.\nWhile tumor samples are washing, prepare media containing EGF-AlexaFluor488, cetuximab and DEAE-dextran as per below. Note, minimum 200 μL medium per condition in Eppendorf tube so that samples do not dehydrate.\nAfter washing with serum-free media, incubate tumor lumps in separate Eppendorf tubes as per following conditions:\nHam’s F-12 media: DMEM media only, No EGF (no uptake control), 30 min, on ice.\nHam’s F-12 media: DMEM media containing EGF-AlexaFluor488 (2 μg/mL), 30 min, on ice.\nHam’s F-12 media: DMEM media containing EGF-AlexaFluor488 (2 μg/mL), 5 min, 37°C.\nHam’s F-12 media: DMEM media containing EGF-AlexaFluor488 (2 μg/mL), 15 min, 37°C.\nHam’s F-12 media: DMEM media containing EGF-AlexaFluor488 (2 μg/mL), 30 min, 37°C.\nHam’s F-12 media: DMEM media containing cetuximab (25 μg/mL), 30 min, 37°C then add EGF-AlexaFluor488 (2 μg/mL), 15 min, 37°C (cetuximab competition).\nHam’s F-12 media: DMEM media containing DEAE-Dextran-Alexa Fluor555 (60 μg/mL), 30 min, 37°C.\nNote: Use multiple tumor sections/lumps in each condition listed above. This allows coverage across multiple tumor areas for each condition and randomizes the experiment.",
    "Note: It is recommended that both positive and negative control samples are processed simultaneously. Multiple tumor samples in each condition allows analysis of different areas of the tumor. Condition (a) is a negative control for both EGF uptake and to be used for secondary antibody only control. Condition (b) is control for EGF ligand binding. Condition (c)-(e) are EGF ligand uptake test conditions and may differ with different tumor samples. These conditions can be co-immunostained with other antibodies if required. For example, total EGF receptor level could be analyzed by co-immunostaining EGF ligand uptake samples with an anti-EGFR antibody. This is described in more detail in step 12, optional (after step 12) and step 14a. Condition (f) is the cetuximab competition test condition. This control directly addresses the specificity of EGF ligand uptake. Cetuximab binds to the EGF ligand binding site on the EGFR therefore should block all EGF ligand binding. Thus, when analyzing by microscopy, this fluorescent level is used as the baseline over which fluorescent signal is judged to be specific, so only EGF-AlexaFluor488 staining above any fluorescence from a cetuximab competition control is used. Cetuximab can also be visualized by using fluorescent secondary antibody. Condition (g) with DEAE-Dextran-AlexaFluor555 for 30 min is used to assess tissue viability, some uptake should be visualized. If you are limited by tumor amount, condition (a), (b), (e) and (f) are essential, condition (c) and (d) can be omitted and condition (g), DEAE-Dextran-Alexa Fluor555, can be added to condition (e). Ensure 37°C incubation is carried out with movement/rocking in oven or incubator. Ensure all samples kept in dark (covered aluminum foil or contained in black 50 mL centrifuge tubes) as fluorophores are used.",
    "Optional: For antibody uptakes, instead of incubating with fluorescent EGF ligand (condition (c)-(e)), any monoclonal antibody of choice can be substituted (e.g., anti-PD-L1 for CT26 mice model). It is crucial to also include relevant controls; no antibody uptake control on ice (condition (a)), antibody uptake control on ice (condition (b)) and DEAE-Dextran-Alexa Fluor555 control (condition (g)) to check for tissue viability. Any antibody uptake conditions should be processed as for cetuximab control condition (f).\nOptional: Fluorescently conjugated cetuximab may be used instead of cetuximab. This optional method would not require incubation with a secondary antibody and the type of fluorophore would need to be different to that used for ligand uptake or immunostaining.\nAfter incubations, wash samples 5 times with cold PBS (total ~30 min)\nFix samples in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 14 h/overnight at 4°C.\nCritical: PFA is toxic. Prepare and handle PFA only in the fume hood, with appropriate PPE and discard appropriately.\nDays 2–3 Whole Mount Tumor Tissue Immunofluorescence Staining, Secondary Antibody Incubation, and Mounting\nTiming: 3–5 h, day 2 and 2–3 h, day 3\nPFA is washed out after fixing tumor samples overnight (8–14 h). The following protocol describes steps for processing tissue with or without additional immunofluorescent staining prior to mounting tissue samples for microscopic analysis.",
    "Note: Dent’s bleach protocol, steps 9–11, is usually only used for human tumors which may have high autofluorescence, this is particularly an issue when imaging the epidermal layer or high keratin or collagen-containing tissue. Dent’s bleach protocol is not usually required if using human or mouse xenografts. Tumors are incubated with Dent’s bleach to reduce autofluorescence but this may also decrease EGF ligand fluorescence. These steps have been provided as part of the normal protocol but are optional, see below. Alternative methods to reduce the effect of sample autofluorescence on image quality include using conjugated far-red fluorophores (e.g., AlexaFluor647) for labelling proteins of interest as less autofluorescence is seen at longer wavelengths when compared to visible wavelength fluorophores. Sudan Black B has also been suggested to be used as an alternative for autofluorescence reduction.\nWash fixed samples twice in PBS.\nOptional: This assay can also be used to compare total antibody uptake or antigen (surface and internal) vs cell surface (antibody bound to the surface only) for both antibody uptakes or post-fixation immunofluorescence staining. To do this, all permeabilization steps need to be omitted including the use of Dent’s bleach protocol (steps 9–12), permeabilization (step 13) and any Triton-X containing buffers (for washes and incubations use Blocking buffer or PBS without Triton-X). This will mean secondary antibody will not have access to internalized antibody or antigen and will only bind to surface exposed antibody. DAPI is cell permeable so this does not interfere with this step. This condition should be done alongside permeabilized samples for comparison.",
    "Optional: The following Dent’s bleach protocol is used to minimize autofluorescence of tissue. If Dent’s bleach is not required, steps 9–11 can be omitted, going straight from washing in PBS after fixation (step 8) to blocking step (step 12). However, if microscopy imaging displays a high level of autofluorescence it is recommended that Dent’s bleach is used.\nPlace samples in 100% methanol at 4°C for 2 h.\nIncubate samples in Dent’s bleach (4 parts methanol:1 part DMSO:1 part 30% H2O2) (Dent et al., 1989[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) for 2 h at room temperature (21°C–25°C) in dark.\nCritical: Toxic! – Prepare and handle Dent’s bleach only in fume hood, with appropriate PPE and discard appropriately. Dent’s bleach is toxic. See safety instructions listed in Materials and Equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section.\nRemove Dent’s bleach and add 100% methanol. Samples now need to go through a methanol series to rehydrate. Incubate samples in MeOH series (10 min each): 75% MeOH, 50% MeOH, 25% MeOH, PBS ×2\nFor samples that require antibody incubation continue to step 13. For samples that do not require antibody staining (conditions (b)-(e)) go to step 19 and continue to end of protocol.\nOptional: Samples that have undergone EGF ligand uptake (Conditions (b)-(e)) can be co-immunostained for other proteins if required and this is described in step 14.\nIncubate samples in blocking buffer (PBTX with 10 % horse serum) for 2–4 h rocking at room temperature (21°C–25°C).",
    "Optional: PBTX is optional. If surface only staining is being examined it can be omitted. If both surface and internalized staining is to be analyzed it should be included. While protocols for monolayer immunofluorescence staining include triton only in the initial steps, standard protocols for tissues keep PBTX throughout primary, washes and secondary staining. This is especially the case for SCC as extremely high collagen secretion occurs in these tumors.\nFor conditions that are being immunostained, incubate with primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer, overnight (8–14 h) at 4°C. Go to step 15 (day 3) and continue to end of protocol.\nConcentration of primary antibody required depends on tissue type, and antigen density. Check with manufacturer’s protocol or perform a titration test prior to running the assay. Post-fixation labelling of EGFR (anti-EGFR (e.g., Clone 31G7, Life Technologies) or alternative) should be completed to enable analysis of EGFR expression and localization.\nPause Point: Incubation of primary antibody occurs overnight (8–14 h), then go to step 15 and continue to end of protocol.\nFor cetuximab competition (condition (f)) and secondary only control, incubate tumor sample with secondary antibody (Anti-human IgG Alexa Fluor555) for 1 h with rocking at room temperature (21°C–25°C). Go to step 17 and continue to end of the protocol.\nNote: The secondary only control is very important as this is used to determine the baseline voltages of laser channels during image acquisition via confocal microscopy, making sure that any signal detected is not from the autofluorescence of the tissue, which may lead to false positives.\nOptional: For antibody uptakes, they should be incubated with appropriate secondary antibody as described in step 14b.\nWash tumor samples 5× in PBTX for 20 min each wash.",
    "Add appropriate secondary AlexaFluor antibodies diluted in blocking buffer and incubate for 1 h with rocking at room temperature (21°C–25°C).\nWash tumor samples 3× in PBTX for 10 min each wash.\nWash tumor samples in PBS twice.\nIncubate tumor samples with DAPI (50 mmol/L in PBS) for 10 min at room temperature (21°C–25°C) to stain cell nuclei.\nNote: DAPI staining of the nuclei is crucial to be able to identify individual cells and tumor regions by microscopy.\nWash tumor samples 3× in PBS.\nMount tumor samples onto concave microscope slides using ProLong™ Gold Antifade Mountant (see mounting Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nAdd drop of ProLong Gold mounting media to center of concave section of slide.\nPlace tumor sections on top of mounting media in center of concave slide.\nPlace coverslip (22 × 50 mm) over tumor sections at angle to avoid formation/accumulation of bubbles around tumor sections. Ensure ProLong Gold mounting media covers tumor sections.\nPress coverslip down firmly on tumor section and seal surrounding coverslip with nail polish. While ProLong Gold and other hardening media work well the nail varnish on the larger coverslips helps reduce any potential drying out prior to media hardening.\nNote: Correct mounting of tumor samples is crucial for successful imaging. Bubbles will interfere with imaging. Tumor sections need to be in center of concave slide such that the sample is in correct plane for microscopy imaging.\nLeave mounting media to cure overnight (8–14 h) in dark before image acquisition.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods Video S1. Mounting of Whole Tumor Tissues on Concave Microscopy Slides Using Slides Using ProLong™ Gold Antifade Mountant (Refer to step 21 on Tumor Mounting)\nDay 4 Microscope Analysis and Image Acquisition\nTiming: 1–2 h per condition",
    "Use confocal microscope to image tumor sections. Microscopy imaging should occur as soon as possible. While fluorescence from secondary antibody post-fixation staining is relatively stable, the directly conjugated ligands fluorescent intensity can decrease to levels difficult to detect against background if not imaged in a timely manner, ideally within a week.\nNote: Controls discussed above are important for both imaging and interpretation of results. For antibody uptake and immunostaining, use secondary only controls to set the imaging settings on the microscope. For EGF ligand uptake staining, use cetuximab competition control to set the imaging settings on the microscope, as described above.\nNote: Post-acquisition analysis methods vary depending on experimental question that is being asked and are described further below (Quantification and Statistical Analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis])."
