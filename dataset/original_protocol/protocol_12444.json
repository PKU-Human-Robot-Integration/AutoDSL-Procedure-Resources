  "title": "Problem-Solving Before Instruction (PS-I): A Protocol for Assessment and Intervention in Students with Different Abilities",
  "procedures": [
    "This protocol follows the Helsinki Declaration of Ethical Principles for Research with Humans, but applies these principles to the added difficulties of integrating research within real-life settings in education32. Specifically, neither the assignment of learning conditions nor the decision to participate can have consequences for students' learning opportunities. In addition, confidentiality and the anonymity of students is maintained even when it is the teachers who are in charge of the evaluation. The aims, scope, and procedures of the protocol have been approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Principality of Asturias (Spain) (Reference: 242/19).\nPlease note that if the user is only interested in implementing the PS-I approach, only Step 6 (without assigning participants to the control condition) and Step 7 are relevant. Despite that, Steps 5 and 9 can be added as practice exercises for students. If the user is also interested in the experimental evaluation, it is important that students work individually during Steps 4, 5, 6, and 9. It is therefore recommended that during these steps, student seating is arranged so that there is an empty space beside each student.\nDepending on convenience, the steps can be implemented continuously within a single class session or with subsequent steps in a different class session.\n1. Information for students about the purpose and procedures of the study\nTake 10 minutes of a class period to inform students about the study.\nExplicitly explain to students the general purpose of the study, their freedom to consent to participate, the fact that they may freely withdraw, and the assurance of anonymity and confidentiality in the data processing.",
    "Tell them that the general purpose of the study is to explore the efficacy of different educational approaches, as well as to evaluate the influence of the students' cognitive and affective dispositions on the efficacy of these approaches.\nTell them that although they will be assigned to one of the two approaches, the content covered in the two conditions will be the same. Inform them that the activities used in both conditions will be available to all students at the end of the study.\nLet them know that they are free to participate in the study and that they can leave the study at any time without affecting their learning opportunities or their grades. If they do not want to participate in the study, they can do the learning activities without handing them in. In addition, during the short time participants are completing questionnaires, non-participants can study other materials.\nInform them that their participation will be anonymous and that confidentiality will be maintained at all times, an arbitrary identification number will be used to combine the data across different sessions and activities.\nProvide students with two copies of the informed consent form (Appendix A) which also contains the researcher's contact information. Ask them to sign one copy for you, and to keep the other copy for themselves.\n\tNOTE: This protocol is aimed at university students, where no parental permission is needed. It could be generalized to lower educational levels, although for students who are legally minors, parental informed consent would also be needed.\nIf students are added to the study in later phases of the protocol, ask them to complete the informed consent as described in this section before they join the study.\n2. Providing students with an identification number disassociated from other records",
    "To maintain the anonymity of students' responses, randomly assign each student an identification number (e.g., prepare a bag with random numbers and ask each student to pick one, email each student a random number through a web application). Ask them to note the number in a place where it will be accessible in the subsequent evaluations in the protocol.\n\tâ€‹NOTE: If the study is done through an online application that allows student responses to be anonymously tracked, this is not necessary.\n3. Completion of questionnaires about cognitive and affective predispositions and basic demographic data\nReserve 10 minutes in a class period to administer the questionnaires to all students in the class.\nGive the students who decide not to participate in the experiment other learning options such as working individually on other content.\nAsk students to complete the questionnaires about their predispositions, this may be done using the questionnaires in Appendix B. Ask them to work individually.\n\tNOTE: The set of questionnaires in Appendix B includes the Cognitive Competence Scale in the Survey of Attitudes towards Statistics (SATS-28) 33, the Mastery Approach Scale in the Achievement Goal Questionnaire-Revised34 , the Regulation of Cognition Scale of the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory35, and demographic questions.\n\t\nTo control for potential contaminant effects related to the order in which students complete the questionnaires, randomly hand different versions of the questionnaire sheets that vary in the order in which the questionnaires are presented. In Appendix B-1 there are different printed versions of the proposed questionnaires with different orders.\n\t\tNOTE: If the questionnaires are completed digitally, create links with the different orders, and randomly distribute the four links among the students in the class (e.g., across groups created by alphabetic order).",
    "Give students 7 minutes to complete the questionnaires. Instructions are included in the questionnaires and no additional instructions are needed.\n4. Administration of the divergent thinking test\nIn case this test is of interest, take 10 minutes in a class period to administer the Alternative Uses Task36,37 which measures fluency of divergent thinking for all students in the class.\nProvide each student with blank paper and ask them to write their identification number.\nExplain the instructions of the test.\n\t\nTell them that they will be provided with an object that has a common use, but they should come up with as many other uses as they can.\nGive them an example (e.g., for instance, if I present you with a newspaper, which is commonly used to read, you have to write alternative uses, such as using it as a temporary hat to protect you from the sun, or to line the bottom of a travel-bag)38.\nRead the first item in the test aloud, and write it on the blackboard: \"Write as many uses you can think of for a brick\". Give students two minutes to write their responses. Once the two minutes are over, ask students to flip their paper to the other side.\nRead the second item in the test aloud, and write it on the blackboard: \"Write as many uses you can think of for a paper clip\". Give students two minutes to write their responses.\nOnce the two minutes are over, ask the students to stop writing, and collect their papers.\n5. Completion of the pre-test of previous academic knowledge\nReserve 15 minutes in a class period to administer the previous academic knowledge pre-test in Appendix C.",
    "NOTE: The pre-test is about central tendency, which is relevant in order to assimilate the content on variability to be learned in the subsequent learning conditions in Step 67. No class content about central tendency should be given to students between the administration of this pre-test and Step 6. We also do not recommend substituting this pre-test with a different pre-test covering variability because that can create a PS-I effect that may contaminate the results of the experiment26.\nDistribute the pre-test to the students. From this point, ask them to work individually.\n\t\nGive students 10 minutes to complete the pre-test. Instructions are included in the test and no more specifications are needed. Once the time is up ask the students to flip their paper over and hand it in to you.\n6. Assignment to and administration of the two learning conditions\nTake 35 minutes of a class period to administer the two learning conditions within the same classroom.\n\tNOTE: To prevent reliability errors due to time, we recommend no more than one week between the completion of the questionnaires and tests in Steps 2 and 3 and this step.\nEnsure that the task books are properly prepared, containing the materials for the two conditions.\n\tNOTE: GDP per capita has been chosen to contextualize these learning materials for several reasons: firstly, it is a controversial topic30 that may be familiar to students from many learning areas, and secondly it is a ratio variable that allows the use of different variability measures that are discussed during the lesson (range, interquartile range, standard deviation, variance, and coefficient of variation).",
    "For the PS-I condition, print the corresponding task book in Appendix D-1 which contains: the Invention Problem activity, in which students are asked to invent an inequality index; the Worked Example activity, in which students can study the solutions for this problem.\nFor the direct instruction condition, print the corresponding task book in Appendix D-1 which contains: the Worked Example activity (the same Worked Example given to the PS-I condition); the Practice Problem paired with this Worked Example.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important that the practice problem included in the materials for this condition is not present in the PS-I condition. It is included to experimentally compensate for the extra time spent by the PS-I students on the invention problem. An intrinsic limitation of PS-I designs is the difficulty to control for equivalence in terms of both time and materials. Even in designs in which the PS-I condition and the control condition only differ in the order in which learning materials are presented (that is, either presenting a problem before an explicit instruction phase, or presenting the exact same problem after the exact same explicit instruction phase), equivalence is not achieved, because a problem that is solved before instruction is expected to take more time than after instruction. This protocol deals with this problem in the same way as other studies24, by including extra materials in the direct instruction condition.\nSeparate the two activities in each task book by binding the papers corresponding to the second activity (e.g., with a clip or a sticky note) together so that students cannot see the contents of the second activity while they are doing the first activity.\nInform students of the procedure to follow in this specific step.",
    "Tell them that depending on the task book they are assigned, they will have two different pairs of activities, but all students will see the same content, and at the end of the lesson all of them will have access to all of the activities.\nLet them know that they will be told when to start the first activity and when they should move to the second activity. Also tell them that the papers for the second activity have been bound to prevent them from looking before the appropriate time.\nTo reduce potential frustration related to fear of failing, tell them that although they might find some activities difficult, they should try to see these difficulties as learning opportunities39.\nRandomly assign the two task books to the students in the class\n\tNOTE: To prevent contaminating factors related to where students are seated, distribute the task books homogeneously across the different parts of the class. For example, as you walk around the class give the PS-I task book to one student, then the direct instruction task book to the next student.\nOnce you have distributed the task books to all the students in the class, ask them to start working individually on the first activity.\n\t\nTell the students that they have 15 minutes for the first activity. Instructions are included in the paper sheets and no more general instructions are needed.\nTell them that you are available for any questions, but avoid giving students with any extra content other than what they have in the task books.",
    "NOTE: Particularly for students solving the invention problem, avoid guiding them towards conventional solutions, because it can shortcut the development of their own knowledge11. Instead, we suggest three possible responses to student questions11: a) help them clarify their own processes by asking them to explain what they are doing; b) help them guide themselves with their intuition by asking them which country they think has more inequality than other countries; c) help them understand the goal of the activity by asking them to produce general indexes that would account for the differences they see, you can provide examples of other quantitative indexes (e.g., \"the mean is an index to calculate the central value in a distribution\").\nOnce the 15 minutes for the first activity are over, ask students to advance to their corresponding second activity, for which they have to remove the clip or sticky note.\n\t\nTell them that they have 15 minutes for the second activity. Instructions are included in the paper sheets and no additional general instructions are needed. Tell them that you are available for any questions.\n\t\tNOTE: Students have access to the content from the previous activity.\nOnce the 15 minutes are over, ask them to hand the completed material to you.\n7. Administration of the lecture content\nReserve 40 minutes within one or several class periods to give the lecture about statistical variability to all students in the class.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be interrupted at any point during the lecture and can continue in the subsequent class session.\nTo give the lecture, follow the slides, which can be found at the following link: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/aa6p3hs8esyf5xa/AACTvpVlEbdEtLVfBIbe9j7aa?dl=0.",
    "â€‹NOTE: The file includes animations to stagger the contents, comments with proposed explanations to give to students, and indications about the approximate time allocated for each explanation. The content and activities included are about the definition of variability, the use of different variability measures (range, interquartile range, variance, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation), the properties of those measures, and their advantages and disadvantages compared to each other and to other suboptimal solutions13. A further description of this proposed lecture can be found in Appendix E. The user can adapt these materials depending on different factors such as specific content to cover in class, preferred instruction principles, or different cultural expressions.\n8. Completion of the curiosity questionnaire\nAt the end of the lecture, give students the Curiosity Scale from the Epistemic Related Emotions Questionnaire40 (Appendix F) and give them 2 minutes to complete it. Remind students to write their identification number on the questionnaire before handing it back.\n\tâ€‹NOTE: In the literature, curiosity is often measured right after the invention activity and the corresponding control activities14,17. The protocol is flexible to this and other possible adaptations in this regard. For simplicity, we only included the measurement of curiosity at the end of the lesson because it is relevant to examining the longer-term effects of PS-I on curiosity, and because increased curiosity right after the invention activity can be partially explained by the fact that during the invention activity students receive less information than during alternative activities used as controls.\n9. Administration of the learning post-test\nIn accordance with the teacher in each class, take 30 minutes in a class period to administer the post-test.\nDistribute the post-test in Appendix G to the students. Ask them to work on it individually.",
    "Give students 25 minutes to do the post-test. Instructions are included in the post-test and no additional general instructions are needed.\nOnce the 25 minutes are up, ask them to hand the post-test back to you.\n10. Providing students with feedback and all learning materials\nMake the materials used for this lesson available to students. The power-point slides, the materials for the two learning conditions, and the solutions for the pre-test and post-test are available in Appendix H.\n11. Coding the data\nCalculate the scores for the different scales in the questionnaires by adding together all the item scores within each questionnaire scale (see Appendix B for a summary of the questionnaire items in the proposed questionnaires).\nCalculate the score for divergent thinking fluency by counting up all the appropriate responses given by each student in both items in the Alternative Uses Task37.\n\tNOTE: Other measures often coded from the Alternative Uses Task, such as flexibility, originality, and elaboration, might also be considered36,37.\nCalculate the score of the previous knowledge pre-test by first grading each item using the answer key in Appendix I-1 and then adding together the scores for all of the items.\nCalculate the different learning measures by first grading each item in the post-test using the answer key in Appendix I-2 then adding together the scores for each learning measure: scores in items 1 to 3 for the procedural learning measure, scores in items 4-8 for the conceptual learning measure, and scores in items 9-11 for the transfer of learning measure.\n\tâ€‹NOTE: Other measures about the learning process such as the number of solutions produced by students during the invention problem or the correctness of the solutions in all problem-solving activities might be considered, but they will not be explained in this protocol.",
    "12. Analysis of the data\nPlease note that references in this section refer to practical manuals on how to perform the analyses with SPSS and PROCESS software but other programs may also be used.\nTo evaluate the general efficacy of PS-I,Â compare the curiosity and learning scores of the PS-I condition versus the curiosity and learning scores of the control condition.\n\tâ€‹NOTE: As long as assumptions are fulfilled, we primarily recommend ANCOVA to control for predisposition of covariates. As a second option we recommend t-tests for independent groups and as a third option we recommend Mann-Whitney U tests41. No minimum sample size is required for these analyses, but considering the effect sizes in previous literature (d = .43)21, a minimum sample of 118 students per group would be recommended to facilitate the identification of the effects as significant (two-tailed power analyses for differences between independent means, Î± = .05, Î² = .95,). Samples larger than 30 students per group would make it easier to meet the assumptions of normality for ANCOVA or t-tests41.\nTo intuitively explore mediation effects (e.g., the mediation of curiosity on learning) and/or the moderating influence of predispositions, perform correlational analyses between the mediator variable (e.g., curiosity) and the learning variable (e.g., conceptual knowledge) in the two learning conditions.",
    "NOTE: As long as assumptions are fulfilled, we primarily recommend the use of Pearson correlations and as a second option we recommend Spearman correlations42. No minimum sample size is required for these analyses, but large samples (e.g., more than 30 students per group) would make it easier to fulfil the assumptions of normality needed for Pearson correlations. Possible moderation effects would be indicated by predisposition variables that have different correlation values in one learning condition versus the other. A possible mediation effect (e.g., the mediation of curiosity on learning) would be indicated if the mediating variable is correlated with the learning outcomes in at least one condition, and if the levels of this variable are different in one learning condition compared to the other (see results in Step 12.1).\nTo continue evaluating a mediation effect on learning and/or the moderating influence of students' predispositions, perform either mediation analysis, moderation analysis, or conditional process analysis (which combines mediation and moderation analysis) depending on the conceptual model to test43, which would vary depending on the hypotheses chosen and/or the preliminary analysis in Step 12.2.\n\tNOTE: Since these analyses are based on multiple regressions, and are therefore based on a fixed effect statistical approach, in order to make the results as generalizable as possible, we recommend a minimum sample size of 15 students per mediation variable included in the conceptual model, plus 30 students per moderation variable included in the model. Some programs such as PROCESS only allow the inclusion of a maximum of two moderating variables at one time. To incorporate more moderating variables, several analyses would need to be run changing the moderators included.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
