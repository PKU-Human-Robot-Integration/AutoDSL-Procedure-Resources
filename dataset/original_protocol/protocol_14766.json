    "Ethical Statement: All methods and procedures performed in these examinations were typical and standard-of-care during this time period of data collection. Informed consent was obtained from all patients, and local institutional review board approval was granted for both studies.\n1. Transseptal Access\nNOTE: Procedural methods and techniques have now been well described in several publications6-11, and the cryoballoon ablation strategy used here was similar to published descriptions.\nExamine patients with a transesophageal echocardiogram on the day of the AF ablation procedure. Use transesophageal echocardiogram imaging to assess the LA for thrombus presence or formation.\nRe-schedule ablation for any patient with LA thrombus present, and correct the patient anticoagulation strategy.\nEstablish patient sedation with the use of general anesthesia (with an agent such as intravenous propofol) or conscious sedation (with agents such as intravenous fentanyl and versed). In both sedation methods, do not use a paralytic agent so that phrenic nerve monitoring can be used during the ablation procedure.\nDuring the AF ablation procedure, use ICE guidance for the transseptal catheterization with a Mullins-type sheath. Use the ICE guidance to position the transseptal needle at the septum, to avoid aortic puncture, and to safeguard against inadvertent LA lateral wall needle-puncture (by examining the needle “tenting” distance during transseptal puncture)12.\n\tNOTE: In the traditional FO location, the transseptal access point is at the thinnest septal tissue depth near the center of the septum which is evaluated by “tenting” the septum with the transseptal needle under ICE imaging (Figure 1).\nFor the IL transseptal location, enter approximately one centimeter below the traditional FO site and at an anterior septal location (Figure 1; panels A and B). The IL location is found through evaluation of ICE and fluoroscopy once the FO site is established.",
    "Use ICE plane imaging to define the entry point in the IL location. Sweep the ICE image anterior towards the plane of the mitral value to define the anterior position of the site.\nThe inferior location will be dependent on the IL, which is triangular in cross-section. Place the transseptal needle puncture at the center of this triangular area.\nFacilitate the IL puncture by further bending the transseptal needle approximately ½ inch from this distal tip. Needle bending is customized to the approach angle on LAO view of the inferior vena cava into the right atrium. Use more needle bending when the approach angle is vertical rather than horizontal to the patient’s body axis.\n\t\nOptionally, use a radiofrequency transseptal needle to facilitate the IL position technique; however, only standard transseptal needles were used for this study.\nImmediately after transseptal puncture, administer heparin bolus using a patient weight-based protocol and then give supplemental doses of heparin throughout the procedure with the goal of maintaining active clotting time between 350 and 400 sec.\nEstablish the transseptal access route with an exchange of the transseptal needle with a guidewire.\n2. Cryoballoon Ablation\nUse the guidewire to introduce the cryoballoon sheath. Then deploy the cryoballoon catheter and the dedicated inner lumen circular mapping catheter into the LA through the cryoballoon sheath.\nDuring each cryoballoon ablation, inflate the cryoballoon and advance it over the inner lumen circular mapping catheter which is wired towards the PV ostium.\nInject 5 to 10 ml of radiopaque contrast agent (isovue 300) through the cryoballoon catheter inner lumen.\nConfirm cryoballoon-to-PV occlusion by using the retention of contrast agent after injection at the distal tip of the balloon.",
    "Additionally (or alternatively), confirm cryoballoon-to-PV occlusion by ICE imaging under color-flow Doppler using the lack of flow around the balloon anterior surface as an indicator of occlusion.\nStart the cryoballoon cryoablation once occlusion is established by pressing the “start” button on the cryoconsole. This action will push cryorefrigerant into the cryoballoon catheter and initiate cryoablation.\nOn right-sided PVs, use a diagnostic catheter in the right atrial/superior vena caval junction and position it to pace the right phrenic nerve.\nPace the phrenic nerve at 20 mA amplitude and 2.0 msec pulse width, and monitor phrenic nerve function by manual detection of diaphragmatic contractions. Immediately terminate any ablation if phrenic nerve function is diminished, delayed, or lost.\nDeliver a minimum of two freezes, each lasting 120 to 180 sec, while using the inner lumen circular mapping catheter to monitor both real-time and post-ablation PVI through entrance and exit block testing.\nOnce entrance and exit block is established at each PV, withdraw the cryoballoon, sheath, and inner lumen circular mapping catheter.\nUse standard medical care to stop bleeding at vascular entry points and discharge patients via hospital protocols, which may include anticoagulation pharmaceutical therapy and guidance on antiarrhythmic drugs."
