    "1. Electrode Localization\nCollect a pre-operative T1-weighted structural MRI (1.5T or 3T) of the patient's head: 256 x 256 pixels per slice, full field of view, no interpolation, 1 mm slice width, preferably sagittal cross-sections.\nObserve the surgical implantation of the grids and strips. Collect digital photographs of the electrodes in situ, and the neurosurgeon's notes on the locations of the implanted grids and strips.\nCollect the post-operative skull X-ray images and brain CT scans at high resolution (1 mm slice width, skin to skin, no angle).\nCreate a three-dimensional cortical model of the patient's brain using the pre-operative MRI, and co-register it with the post-grid implantation CT images. We use the CURRY software package for this purpose, and export the 3D cortical structure and electrode coordinates in MATLAB format. From MATLAB, we export a movie that shows the electrodes mapped onto the brain. We also map the electrode coordinates to standard Brodmann areas using an automated Talairach atlas.",
    "Review the information from the 3D model, X-ray images, photographs and notes. Finalize a numbering scheme for the electrodes, and work with the hospital technicians to ensure that the electrodes are patched into the splitter boxes following this numbering exactly. Also create a schematic layout for plotting the electrodes in two dimensions, such that all the electrode positions can be clearly distinguished without overlapping. If you are going to run SIGFRIED (see section 4), save these two-dimensional coordinates as a BCI2000 parameter fragment, in the format required by the ElectrodeLocations parameter. Finally, select two electrode locations that are likely to be electrocorticographically \"silent,\" i.e., they are not near the presumed eloquent cortex, to use as an initial ground and reference (prepare the g.USBamps by patching the reference to the blue sockets, and ground to the yellow sockets, on the extreme right of each unit).\n2. Hardware and Software Setup\nEnsure that the computer specifications are adequate for handling the processing requirements of the experiment. A multi-core processor will likely be necessary to accommodate the demands of real-time data acquisition and processing, video recording, and other necessary tasks. For recording and real-time analysis of 128 channels at 1200 Hz, we use a 3-GHz quad-core machine with 4 GB of RAM. The amplifiers should be connected to a dedicated USB controller, distinct from the controller(s) used by other bandwidth-hungry peripherals, such as external drives and cameras (this can be verified via the system's Device Manager). Finally, there must be sufficient disk space to store up to 5 MB per second of experimental data, and a system for archiving and backing it up.",
    "Set up the research equipment (amplifiers, computer, experimenter's screen, keyboard, speakers, microphone and camera) on a single trolley, which can be quickly rolled in and out of the patient's room, with only a single power cord to plug into the wall. To move the computer from room to room, use the Hibernate function before unplugging. The patient's video screen should be on a separate tray table or monitor arm. Considering that the patient is prone to seizures, make sure that all the equipment can be rolled out of the way quickly in case medical personnel need immediate access to the patient. The equipment should also be disinfected with antiseptic wipes before and after use in the patient's room.",
    "Time with the patient is limited, and all procedures need to be robust and optimized to make best use of that time. In this regard, the flexibility and robustness of BCI2000 are invaluable characteristics. Ensure that the experiments can be launched at the touch of a button. In the case of BCI2000, use a batch file to launch the right combination of BCI2000 modules automatically, with the required command-line options. The Operator and gUSBampSource modules are required, along with the appropriate SignalProcessing and Application modules for your particular experiment. Use BCI2000's Operator scripting feature to ensure that all the required parameter files are loaded automatically-including any that are specific to this patient, such as the number of electrodes and their names and positions. The purpose of this automation is to minimize the number of manual steps by the experimenter, and thus the opportunities for error. The software and its parameters need to have been finalized and tested (perhaps with an EEG subject) at least one or two weeks before implantation. It is also highly advisable to perform a \"dry\" run the day before the first experimental session, including all the new patient-specific parameters.\n3. Experimental Session Set-up\nChoose your moment for suggesting experimental recordings to the patient, giving them notice earlier in the day, and again 15 minutes before you start. Work around visitors, meals, naps, medical procedures, and the patient's physical, emotional and cognitive state. It is important to establish a rapport with medical personnel on the floor, to help in optimizing the timing and duration of recordings.\nWheel the equipment into place, connect to the power outlet, turn on the subject's video screen and connect it to the computer, and un-hibernate the computer.",
    "Launch BCI2000. With the VisualizeSource parameter enabled, press Set Config. The signal viewer opens, letting you assess the ECoG signal quality. Right-click on the viewer and set the high-pass filter to a 5 Hz cutoff. (This filter setting will only affect visualization, and not collection of data.)\nCheck for interference from power line noise: Does activating a notch filter in the viewer (at 50 Hz or 60 Hz, depending on which country you are in) make a big difference to the signal? If so, try to reduce this by removing any unused cross-talking cables, or identifying and removing other sources of power interference. Change the electrodes used for reference and ground if necessary.\nIf you are using an eye-tracker, calibrate it using the calibration software provided by the manufacturer. The BCI2000 source module should be compiled with the EyetrackerLogger extension included, and should be launched with the --LogEyetracker=1 flag enabled, so that eye-tracking data can be acquired in synch with the ECoG signals.\nTo avoid distractions and interruptions, and to minimize possible signal interference, ensure that TVs, radios and mobile phones are turned off.\nGive precise instructions to the patient for the experiment you are about to run. Depending on the subject's task, prepared Powerpoint slides that show the task, the suggested posture, etc., can prove useful.\nPress Start on the Operator to start the experiment. Each time you press Start or Resume, a new file will be created to avoid overwriting previous data, and the file will be initialized with a copy of all the parameter values. Raw data will then be streamed automatically to the file, along with event markers, until you press Suspend or the experimental run finishes.",
    "Throughout the session, monitor the patient's behavior and the ECoG signals for suspected seizures, and be ready to respond to instructions from medical staff.\n4. Example Experimental Session: SIGFRIED Clinical Mapping with BCI2000\nPreparation: Before the session starts, you will need to have prepared a model.ini file that contains the signal-processing settings SIGFRIED will use to build a model, and a .prm file (or separate .prm fragments) containing the BCI2000 parameters that the SigfriedSigProc module will use for real-time visualization. Two key parameters are ElectrodeLocations, specifying the 2-D layout you have chosen for this patient's particular electrodes, and ElectrodeCondition, which specifies which different tasks will be mapped under which conditions. In this example, we are using the simple StimulusPresentation module for communicating instructions to the patient, so the Stimuli parameter also needs to be adapted to the tasks we intend to run.\nBaseline Step: Start the gUSBampSource, DummySignalProcessing and StimulusPresentationTask modules, configured to sample ECoG activity from all grids and strips at 1200Hz, high-pass-filtered at 0.1 Hz. Instruct the subject to relax and remain motionless with eyes open. Record 6 minutes of baseline activity, under comfortable illumination in a quiet environment.\nModeling Step: Start the data2model_gui tool and extract features in 5 Hz bins from 70 to 110 Hz using maximum entropy method for every 500 ms of data. Press Build Model to build a probabilistic model of the selected spectral features using Gaussian mixtures.",
    "Mapping Step: Start the gUSBampSource, SigfriedSigProcLAVA and StimulusPresentationTask modules and configure the Operator to load the probabilistic model, the cortical model, and the 2- and 3-dimensional electrode coordinates. After instructing the subject, start the mapping process. In this process, a subject will perform each task for 10 seconds at a time, on each of 5 repetitions. During each task, SIGFRIED detects task-related ECoG activity that is presented in continuously updated 2- and 3-dimensional maps of eloquent cortex. In the 2-dimensional maps, the size and redness of each circle represents its importance in this particular task. Specifically, the size of each circle is proportional to the fraction of the total signal variance in the gamma band that is accounted for by the task. This statistic is known as the coefficient of determination, or r2. It is in the range (0,1) and in the current setup a value of 0.1 can generally be considered significant. The scaling of the circles to maximum r2 values can be controlled using the sliders (see Figure 1C). In the 3-dimensional maps, the r2 values are mapped to different colors rather than circle sizes.\n5. Representative Results",
    "Figure 1 shows representative results, from one SIGFRIED mapping session in one patient. The patient was a 28-year-old right-handed female who had intractable localization-related epilepsy of left-temporal onset with secondary generalization. 120 electrocorticographic electrodes were implanted subdurally over left frontal, parietal and temporal cortex. A lateral x-ray (panel A) and an intra-operative photograph (panel B) depict the configuration of one frontal grid with 40 electrodes, one higher-density temporal grid with 68 electrodes, and three strips each of 4 electrodes. From the recorded seizures, a neurologist localized the epileptic foci and determined that it was necessary to perform surgical resection of the left temporal lobe while sparing eloquent language cortex. This was performed successfully: at 8 months post-resection the patient has been assessed as seizure free and without neurological deficits. The passive mapping procedure SIGFRIED identified cortex involved in language function by contrasting task-related changes during listening tasks. The results were presented in two interfaces: a 2-dimensional interface (panel C), which makes the layout of the electrodes clear, and a 3-dimensional anatomically-correct interface (panel D). From left to right the panels contrast listening to spoken language vs baseline (VOICE), listening to tones vs baseline (TONES), and listening to spoken language vs listening to tones (LANGUAGE). The last of these is included as a rough picture of auditory function that is specific to receptive language. The results of the VOICE condition showed good agreement with locations at which ECS disrupted receptive language function in this patient (marked as yellow circles in panel A).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3993/3993fig1.jpg",
    "Figure 1. Example results from one patient. Panel A shows a lateral x-ray. Yellow circles mark the electrodes implicated in receptive language, as subsequently identified by electrocortical stimulation mapping. Panel B is a photograph taken during implantation. Panel C shows the SIGFRIED mapping results in a schematic two-dimensional layout: the size and redness of each disc represents the significance of the involvement of each electrode in the task, relative to baseline. In panel D, the same statistic is mapped to color on a three-dimensional brain model rendered from the patient's MRI.Subscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
