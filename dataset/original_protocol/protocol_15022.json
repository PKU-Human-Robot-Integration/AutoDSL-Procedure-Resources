    "The following protocol adheres to the guidelines of the University of Washington institutional review board.\n1. Electrophysiological Assessment\nPreparation of Session\n\t\nRoom preparation: place the manipulandum (see Figure 1), a wooden block with a sensor attached, which sends a time-stamped marker to acquisition software when it is grasped, on the table within grasping reach of the participant. Activate EEG acquisition software and begin “new session” (Figure S1).\nNet preparation: warm solution of distilled water (1 L), potassium chloride (1 tablespoon), and baby shampoo (1 teaspoon) to 104 °F. Soak 128-electrode dense-array EEG system in the warmed saline solution.\nParticipant preparation: ensure that the participant is seated comfortably approximately 75 cm from the stimulus presentation monitor and fully in view of the video camera. Find and mark the vertex on the participant’s head with a skin marker. Measure the vertex by finding the intersection of the midpoint between the nasion and the inion and the midpoint between preauriculars.\nNet application: Position the EEG cap on the participant’s head such that the vertex electrode is placed directly over the vertex mark. Check impedances and ensure that impedances are below the threshold appropriate for the EEG system in use (Figure S2).\nBegin video taping session.\nRecording setup: Reference signal to the vertex electrode. Analog filter between 0.1 and 100 Hz, amplify the signal, and digitize at 500 samples/sec.\nStimulus presentation: present participant with 3 conditions: observe, execute and rest, adapted from the paradigm developed by Muthukumaraswamy and colleagues5.",
    "Observe condition: Instruct participant to sit quietly and watch a video of a person grasping the manipulandum. Each trial should last 6 sec. Time the prerecorded video for the observe trials precisely to ensure that the observed grasp occurs at exactly 3 sec. Monitor participant’s visual attention during the task, and mark trials during which they do not attend to the screen to be discarded during post-processing.\nExecute condition: Instruct participant to sit quietly with right hand resting just below the manipulandum and, upon hearing a prerecorded auditory cue, to imitate the manipulandum grab from the observe condition video clip. Each trial should last 6 sec. Ensure that the auditory cue is presented at exactly 3 sec by prerecording an auditory track that maintains a consistently timed execute cue and inter-trial interval. Utilize a sensor on the manipulandum to precisely record the time that the participant’s grasp occurs (Figure S3).\nRest condition: Instruct participant to sit quietly with eyes open and passively observe a small crosshair on the stimulus monitor. Record continuous EEG during the rest condition for 3 min.\nFor both observe and execute conditions, present randomized blocks of ten trials, for a total of forty trials per condition. Ensure that the image of the manipulandum remains on screen throughout the observe and execute blocks, including between trials. Administer the rest condition at the completion of the observe and execute conditions.\nData Processing\n\t\nFollowing data collection, recheck impedances. Note any changes to impedance levels. End acquisition software recording.\nPost-processing: Rereference EEG signal to the average. Segment continuous EEG data into forty 6-sec trials for each condition (Figure S4).",
    "Conduct automated artifact detection. Use automated algorithms to inspect segments for movement artifacts by identifying fast average amplitudes exceeding 200 µV, differential average amplitudes exceeding 100 µV, and zero variance across a given trial (Figure S5).\nConduct manual artifact detection by visually inspecting data and confirming with video review of the session to remove all trials in the observation condition contaminated with any movement artifact and all trials in the execution condition contaminated with any movement artifact unrelated to the grasp gesture. Exclude trials with significant artifact from analysis. Discard any trials that were flagged during acquisition as not attended. Examine and note rate of trial rejection for each diagnostic group under analysis.\nData analysis\n\t\nPer Muthukumaraswamy et al.5, segment cleaned trials into 2 sec epochs consisting of 1 sec of data before the grasp and 1 sec after for both the observe (as marked by the photocell) and execute (as marked by the manipulandum sensor) conditions. Segment cleaned 2 sec epochs from the rest condition. \nFast Fourier transform (FFT) each segment. Select a cluster of eight electrodes on each hemisphere surrounding the standard C3 and C4 positions for statistical analyses (following Muthukumaraswamy et al.5 and Bernier et al.3) (Figure 2). For each condition, average the power across the included trials to calculate power spectra.\nCalculate mu attenuation by examining the average power during either the execution or observation of a motor action, relative to the average power during the resting condition, across the 8-13 Hz range. Use the log of this ratio to determine degree of attenuation. Note: a negative value represents attenuation during execution or observation, while a positive value represents augmentation. This methodology takes into account variability across individuals, and the non-normality of values expressed in ratio form.",
    "Note: This protocol was developed using a 128-electrode dense-array EEG system with Net Station software version 4.1. While the basic steps are similar across EEG systems, acquisition and analysis protocols may vary.\n2. Sample Characterization\nIdentify potential patient population for participation in paradigm through research registries, previous participant listings, or referrals from area clinics and clinicians.\nScreen potential participants for likelihood of meeting diagnostic criteria for clinical construct (e.g. Autism Spectrum Disorder) and to identify any exclusionary criteria, such as presence of head injury, tumor, seizure history, or use of anti-convulsant or barbiturate medication which may distort the electrophysiological signal.\nConfirm diagnostic status of patient population through the use of gold standard diagnostic instruments (e.g. Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R11) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G,12) administered by expert clinician following Diagnostic and Statistical Manual – 5th Edition (DSM-5) criteria13.\nIdentify control sample matched on relevant variables of interest, such as age, gender, cognitive ability, etc.\nSubscription Required.
