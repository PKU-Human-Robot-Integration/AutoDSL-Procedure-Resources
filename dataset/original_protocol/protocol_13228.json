    "1. Grid Vitrification\nNOTE: For all steps in steps 1 and 2, ensure that all tools are clean, dry and at room temperature before cooling them to LN2 temperature, using freshly decanted LN2 to reduce ice contamination. Where possible, work within a humidity-controlled environment with < 20% relative humidity. Ensure appropriate personal protective equipment and H&S documentation is in place before commencing work.\nEnsure the specimen of interest is ready for sample preparation.\nChoose appropriate cryoEM grids and ensure these have been rendered hydrophilic using glow discharge or plasma treatment. A wide variety of systems and variations to the protocol are available but all involve placing the grids into a glow discharge/plasma cleaning system and running a program which will pump the chamber to a desired vacuum level, before introducing a specific gas mixture/chemical vapor or air into the system. An electric current is passed through the system, ionizing the gas particles and inducing the surface of the grids to be rendered more hydrophilic.\nStart up the plunge freezing device for grid vitrification by turning on the system using the power switch on the back, and wait for the touch screen to load.\nUsing the provided stylus or fingers, in Console, set the desired working temperature of the chamber (range available is 4-60 °C, recommended for most macromolecules 4-6 °C).\nFill the humidifier with 50 mL of type II lab water using a syringe, via the rubber tubing at bottom of humidifier. Making sure to remove any trapped air in the syringe prior to filling. Be careful not to overfill the humidifier or water will exude into the chamber. Once the humidifier is filled, draw back the syringe plunger by 5-10 mL to create a vacuum seal.",
    "In Console, set the desired relative humidity for the chamber (range available is 0-100%, humidity of 95-100% is typically used). Leave humidity set to 'off' until immediately prior to grid making so that the chamber does not get too wet.\nObtain the plunge freezing device tweezers and filter paper cut to the correct size to fit onto the pads, either purchased or using a stamp to cut an aperture of the appropriate size.\nPrepare the cryogen for plunge freezing.\n\t\nPlace the metal cryo-grid box holder, cryogen cup and metal spider's legs into the coolant container.\nCool down the container by filling up the outer chamber with LN2. Keep the outer chamber topped up to cover the top of the cryo-grid box holder. Add ~ 1 cm of additional LN2 to the cryogen cup to assist equilibration of the system to LN2 temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: The anti-contamination ring can be used to limit humid air condensing around the cryogen cup and leading to cryo-coolant/ethane contamination. This is not generally required in a humidity-controlled environment. If using the anti-contamination ring, be careful not to overfill the container with LN2 or it may spill when the ring is pressed into the container later in the process.\nWait 3-5 min to observe the boiling of the spider legs, and then wait a further 3 min to ensure the cryogen cup is sufficiently cold to condense the vitrification medium.\nLiquefy the cryogen (liquid ethane) into the cryogen cup.\n\t\nTake the ethane cylinder pipe with thin tubing and a nozzle to dispense the gas. A P200 pipette tip with the aperture opened by cutting off the very tip using a razor blade is ideal here. A wider aperture is needed to prevent ethane solidifying at the tip and blocking the flow of gas.",
    "Ensuring the cryogen cup does not contain any remaining LN2, take the ethane gas nozzle and place it within the cryogen cup. Using the gas cylinder regulator, start a low flow and dispense cryogen gas into the cryogen cup to condense the gas. Keep the tip from which the gas flows directly pressed against the wall of the cryogen cup but move it gently back and forth in a tapping motion against the surface. Regulate the flow of the gas to allow a low, steady flow to begin to condense/liquify in a controlled fashion within the cryogen cup.\nFill the cup to just below the silver spider rim and stop the gas flow, then remove gas line carefully to avoid contaminating the surrounding LN2 with ethane.\nTop up the coolant container with LN2, being very careful not to spill any into the liquid ethane.\nLeave the spiders legs in position for ~ 3-5 min to ensure the liquid ethane is equilibrated to a sufficiently cold temperature. The cryogen will begin to look cloudy/slightly opaque. This indicates that it is close to its freezing point. At this stage, use tweezers to remove the spider. As long as the LN2 is kept within the container surrounding the cryogen cup, the ethane will now stay liquefied and suitable for vitrification for 1-2 h. However, aim to complete the procedure as quickly as possible, especially in non-humidity-controlled rooms, to reduce ice contamination.\n\t\tNOTE: If the spider appears to be 'stuck on', use a metal object such as a nut and hold against the spider's legs to warm them up slightly, and then remove the legs.\nPrepare the plunge freezing device and accessories for sample vitrification.",
    "Add grid storage boxes to the metal cryo-grid box holder and throughout the procedure ensure the LN2 is kept topped up to just above the level of the grid boxes (usually every ~ 5 min).\nOn the plunge freezing device screen, in the Process Parameters box input the chosen parameters including: blot time (the time the plunge freezing device pads will come together), force (the distance of the blotting pads from the grid, which alters the gradient of ice formation) and total (number of times the blotting pads will come in to meet). Choose these parameters based on the individual plunge freezing device and behaviour of the macromolecule. Typical values are a blot force between 0 and 5, blot time from 1-6 s and a blot total of 1. Typical wait time (time between initiating the blot, and the blot beginning) and drain time (time after blotting before plunging) is 0-2 s.\n\tNOTE: Depending on user preferences, additional options in the Options, Miscellaneous section can be selected, including Use Foot Pedal to move to the next step on each press, Skip Grid transfer (skips the final step where the tweezer arm is raised slightly), turn Humidity Off During Process (while the sample is being applied, stops active humidification of the chamber which can make it harder to see the grid) and Autoraise Ethanelift (combines the step of tweezers being raised into the chamber and raising the coolant container- skips Raise ethane container step). Here, all of these options are turned on.\nPlace the coolant container securely onto the moving platform arm under the chamber\nInsert fresh blotting paper onto each blotter arm making sure plastic ring clips are secured. Each filter paper will allow 16 blots (arms rotate blotting paper). Press the Reset blot paper button in Controls section.",
    "Run 1 full cycle of the plunge freezing device vitrification process to ensure that each moving part is behaving as expected.\n\t\nPress (or use foot pedal) to Place new grid, then Start process, then Process then Continue. At this stage, watch to ensure the blotting arms are contacting each other as expected.\nTurn 'on' the humidifier. Water vapor will be produced (as long as the set humidity is higher than currently in the chamber).\nThe specimen of interest can now be vitrified. Use the foot pedal or Place New Grid and the plunging rod will descend out of the chamber allowing the tweezers to be attached into the mount.\n\t\nUsing the plunge freezing device tweezers, pick up the desired glow discharged/plasma cleaned cryoEM grid, taking care to note which side is the correct side to be used for sample application according to the grid manufacturer. Pick up the grid by the rim, taking care to avoid excessive/unnecessary contact with the tweezers as this will damage the support. Secure the grid in the tweezers by moving the black clip down to the ridged part of the tweezers. The grid needs to be securely held, but the clip should not be too far down as it will contact the blotting pads, leading to irreproducible blotting and, later, the tweezers will need to be held below this point when releasing the clip.\nPlace the plunge freezing device tweezers holding the cryoEM grid onto the pneumatic arm with the correct side facing your dominant hand. The design of the plunge freezing device tweezers and chamber are such that the sample can be applied through either the right or left-hand side of the chamber, according to the handedness of the user.",
    "NOTE: Applying the sample on different sides with the same blotting parameters rarely results in comparable results, so left-handed researchers may need to tune their blotting parameters independently of their right-handed colleagues.\nPress Start Process and the grid held in the tweezers will be taken into the chamber and the coolant container will be raised.\nPress Process and the tweezers will move the grid to the position where a pipette can be used to apply the specimen to the grid. Open the side port facing the correct side of the grid and apply sample by pipetting, making sure that the pipette tip does not touch the grid as it may lead to damage of the grid support/bending the grid, but dispense the liquid close enough so that the droplet dispenses onto the grid. Typically, 3-5 µL is applied.\nPress Continue and user predefined parameters will blot the grid and then plunge the tweezers with grid mounted into the coolant cup for sample vitrification. Tweezers will descend in conjunction with the arm holding the coolant container and coolant, keeping the grid submerged in the cryogen.\nTransfer the grid from the cryogen cup to the grid storage box submerged in LN2.\n\t\nDetach the tweezers from the tweezer arm, taking great care not to contact the vitrified grid with the sides of the cryogen cup. Adjust the grip so that the tweezers are held comfortably. As quickly and carefully as possible, move the grid from the cryogen to the LN2. With one hand, hold the tweezers shut using your fingers and with the other hand, slide the black clip upwards out of the way, holding the tweezers shut. Readjust the grip and manipulate the grid into the grid storage box.",
    "Repeat steps 1.10-1.19 until all grids are made (a typical session will involve making 4-12 grids). Store all grid storage boxes containing grids in LN2 dewar until the next stages.\n2. Clipping grids for loading into an autoloader microscope\nClip grids into autogrid assembly according to the protocol previously described 28.\n3. Secure remote log in to microscopes\nNOTE: With COVID-19 controls at the time of writing, but also with environmental concerns associated with international travel, more microscopy facilities have been offering services where the user operates remotely. The method of implementation for this will vary according to the local IT configuration of each facility, and the needs of its internal and external user community. Here the process for remotely accessing cryoEMs at eBIC and controlling the microscope through EPU software is described.\nRemotely log in to cryoEM's. Remote logon is mediated via NoMachine software to access the microscope support PC and is configured to only allow access to users who are registered on a visit via the users FedID logon credentials. Access remains active only for the duration of the session.\nOpen NoMachine and start a new NX connection to nx-cloud.diamond.ac.uk with password authentication.\nOpen the connection and log in with the username fedid@fed.cclrc.ac.uk and FedID password. Double-click the icon corresponding to relevant microscope from the available options to open a connection to the relevant support PC.\nEnter username clrc\\FedID and password at the Windows logon screen.\nOpen TeamViewer software from the desktop icon and connect to PartnerID: TEM with the supplied password. This establishes the connection from the support PC to the TEM PC. The Next Monitor button in the TeamViewer ribbon can be used to toggle between the microscope user interface and the EPU window.",
    "Microscope functions can then be controlled by users directly through the EPU interface.\n4. Loading samples into an autoloader microscope and screening for ice and sample quality\nNOTE: In this section a microscope with an autoloader and EPU software is used for sample screening, but this can be achieved using other software and a side entry system and cryoEMs from other manufacturers.\nLoad clipped grids into the microscope autoloader as previously described28.\nIn the autoloader tab of the microscope user interface, tab out the Options dialogue using the arrow and press the Inventory button. This will sequentially check each position in the cassette to determine if a cartridge is present. Occupied slots will be labelled in blue. If all occupied slots have been mapped, press the Inventory button again to stop after the current position, otherwise leave running until all occupied slots have been mapped. Label all occupied slots with the sample details in the boxes provided.\nHighlight the grid to be transferred to the microscope column and click Load. The slot label will turn from blue to yellow once the grid has been successfully loaded onto the stage. Proceed to screen the grids.\n\t\nOpen EPU software. On the Preparation page, select Acquisition optics and settings then select the Atlas preset from the drop-down menu. Choose appropriate beam setting presets (e.g., 64x nominal mag, spot size 5, Microprobe, with an illuminated area in the parallel range for Falcon detector- for further information choosing beam setting presets see28). Press Set to push the parameters to the microscope.",
    "Press Open column valves and insert the FluScreen. Check that a beam is visible and sufficiently spread and centered to cover the detector. If necessary, navigate to a thinner region of the grid using the joystick or stage menu to control stage movements in X and Y.\nLift the FluScreen and take an image using the Preview button in EPU. Based on the acquired image, the dose can be increased by moving to a lower number spot size, and vice versa.\nIn EPU, go to the Atlas page and press New Session. Select MRC image format and enter a suitable folder name and location for saving the screening session, then click Apply.\nSelect Screening from the menu on the left. Tick the checkboxes next to each grid to have an atlas montage acquired. Start the screening session in EPU. An atlas will be acquired for each checked grid, with a number of available grid squares listed upon completion. Each atlas can be viewed by highlighting it on the screening page, complete with a mark-up showing grid squares with a similar predicted ice thickness grouped by colour.\nOn completion, review the collected atlases and identify the grids suitable for assessing sample quality at higher magnifications (i.e., those with an appropriate number of grid squares which are neither dry nor obscured by thick ice). Highlight the chosen grid on the EPU screening menu and click Load sample.\n\t\nUse the beam setting presets (See 28 for explanation of beam setting presets desired for each stage) and the preview function to examine the desired grid squares in greater detail.",
    "From the Atlas screening menu, select the grid presently loaded and move the stage to a grid square containing filled holes by right clicking over the desired location on the grid image and selecting move to grid square.\nReturn to EPU, Preparation page and select the GridSquare preset.\nOpen the EPU, Auto Functions page and run Auto-eucentric by stage tilt with the GridSquare preset to move the sample to eucentric height.\n\t\tNOTE: Auto- eucentric by beam tilt is also available, which is faster but typically less accurate than auto-eucentric by stage tilt.\nIn EPU, Preparation, take a new GridSquare Preview image. Note the differing grey values across different holes indicating differing ice thicknesses. Move the stage over a hole using right click > move stage here. Select the Hole/Eucentric Height preset and Preview.\n\t\tNOTE: Depending on the molecular weight and shape of the particle of interest, it may be possible to identify it at Hole/Eucentric Height magnification.\nSelect Data Acquisition preset and set a magnification that allows easy identification of the particles (corresponding to an object sampling of generally <2 Å/pixel). Set the defocus offset to ~-3 to -5 µm with an exposure electron dose of ~40-80 e-/ Å2.\nIterate through steps in 4.4 to assess a range of ice thicknesses for particle distribution, orientation and contamination across the grid. The particle distribution may vary close to the edges versus the center of the hole and hence it is important to survey different locations with the hole.\nScreen all grids which show promise from atlases as having sufficient grid squares. Either keep these in the microscope and proceed to data acquisition using EPU, or unload the samples from the microscope and store under LN2 until data collection is scheduled.",
    "5. Single particle cryoEM data collection (with a focus on remote operation)\nNOTE: A detailed protocol for data acquisition with EPU is described in the manufacturers manual and elsewhere28. Here modifications of this protocol for remote operation (namely reducing use of the hand panels to conduct tasks and using software-based alternatives) are highlighted.\nUnless one has already been collected during the session, collect an Atlas for the grid.\nDefine each of the beam setting presets according to the experimental needs of the project.\nPerform image shift calibrations28.\nSet up the EPU session.\n\t\nIn EPU, select EPU page then Session Setup, select New session then New from preferences.\nSelect New session a pop up will appear providing an option to use previous settings. Yes will automatically load the settings from the previous EPU (i.e., specimen carrier, defocus range, autofocus settings, grid type) into the current EPU session. Selecting New from preferences enables the user to pick a file with saved preferences (i.e., defocus range, autofocus settings, grid type) and this information will be preloaded into EPU.\nFill in session name with something informative. The local facility may suggest a naming convention.\nIn Type, select Manual.\nFor Acquisition mode, select accurate hole centering or faster acquisition.\nIn Image format, select desired format.\nSelect an appropriate Storage Folder and EPU will create a directory with the session name.\nSelect the appropriate Specimen Carrier according to which grid type and hole spacing being used (e.g., Quantifoil 1.2/1.3) and press Apply. This protocol describes the process for generating a template for a regular array of holes\nSelect an initial grid square and set an acquisition template.\n\t\nGo Square selection, if all squares are green, click unselect all in top left.",
    "Open tiles (right click > open tile). Select a square (right click > add, right click > Move stage to grid square).\nGo to Hole selection and press Auto Eucentric. Wait until this is complete and a Grid Square image has been taken. If the autofunction fails this may be because the height is significantly off; if so it can be adjusted manually using the FluScreen at Grid Square magnification.\nMeasure hole size. Move and adjust the yellow circles so they are over the holes with correct size and spacing.\nPress Find holes. Check that the holes have been found correctly. If not change the hole size and find holes again. Repeat this until it finds the hole correctly. If it consistently fails, consider moving to a lower number (brighter) spot size at grid square magnification.\nUse the Filter ice quality histogram on the right to adjust hole selection. This can be useful to exclude areas with thick ice and thin ice. This will be remembered for future grid squares selected during this session.\nOptimize hole selection with the tools in Select menu at the top. For example, click Remove holes close to grid bar.\nGo to Template definition and press Acquire.\nClick Find and centre hole. There will now be an image of a hole with a yellow circle around the hole.\n\t\tNOTE: If it struggles to find the hole, insert the objective aperture. If it still cannot find the hole, try increasing the exposure time for the hole/eucentric height preset or increasing the defocus for this preset or bin the image. A large defocus change may alter the image shift alignment.\nChange the Delay after Stage Shift and the Delay after Image Shift times to 1-5 s.",
    "Check Maximum Image shift value (if option is available) is as desired. If aberration free image shift collection is being used, this value is defined in the EPU configuration file, otherwise 5 µm is a standard value.\nClick Add acquisition area, then click anywhere on the image. Move the acquisition area to desired location (i.e., at the edge of a hole) so that areas of acquisition are not doubly exposed with the beam (the square in the green circle represents the detector area, the green circle is the beam diameter).\nOn the top right, add the defocus range. Then add other acquisition areas. A typical defocus list for a membrane protein project is -0.8 to -3 µm defocus.\nClick Add autofocus area and click anywhere on the image. Move the autofocus area to the carbon surrounding a hole. Standard practice is to autofocus after centring when using AFIS, or every 5-15 µm, depending on the z-height variation across the square.\nClick Add drift measurement area, drift measurement performed once per grid square, with a set threshold of 0.05 nm/s is a standard setting. The drift measurement area can (and it is a good idea to) overlap directly with autofocus area. Make sure neither drift nor autofocus area overlap with an acquisition area.\n\t\tNOTE: The template can be checked using the template execution function. This is a good idea to see if acquisition areas need moving (e.g., too much/not enough carbon in images), but is not necessary.\nGo back to Square selection, and on the grid select the squares for acquisition. Use the number of acquisition areas and expected data acquisition rate (from facility based on detectors and experimental set up) to predict how many acquisition areas are required.\nWhen all desired squares are selected, press Prepare all Squares.",
    "Once each square is collected, navigate between the grid squares and fine tune the holes using the selection brush.\nMove to a stage location over specimen and use auto functions to set eucentric height. Perform microscope alignments as previously described28, but instead of performing Coma-free alignment and correcting for objective astigmatism manually, make use of alignment tools within the software. Briefly, set acquisition beam conditions, ensure the objective aperture (OA) is removed and the stage is positioned over a beam stable area of specimen at eucentric height. Perform coma-free alignment within the auto-functions before reinserting and centering the OA and correcting the objective lens astigmatism with EPU. Ensure that both alignments converge on suitable values (<150 nm of coma and close to zero astigmatism.\n\t\nBefore starting the automated acquisition run, ensure the autoloader turbo pump is turned off, and the objective aperture is inserted.\nIn Automated acquisition, press Start run to commence automated data acquisition.\n6. Image processing to yield EM density map\nNOTE: The majority of cryoEM facilities offer pre-processing of micrograph movies 'on the fly'. There are a wide variety of software packages and approaches available for this including RELION pipelines28,33, cryoSPARC43, Scipion34 and WarpEM44. A RELION based pipeline is described here and it is assumed that the user has moved the micrograph movies to an appropriate storage location with access to computing resources. An overview of the process and representative results for a membrane protein project are provided, a detailed description and step by step tutorial can be found on the RELION homepage: https://www3.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/relion.",
    "Perform 'on the fly' analysis of micrograph motion correction and CTF estimation. Start RELION within the project directory. Schedule Import, Motion correction and CTF estimation jobs to loop such that they are concurrent with data collection and transfer. A micrograph analysis script28 provides real-time visual feedback on astigmatism and estimated defocus values (see representative results).\nPick particles from pre-processed micrographs. There are a number of automated particle picking software packages to choose from. Reference free and template-based picking options are available within the Auto-picking tab of RELION37. Other programs may be used for various steps, for example using crYOLO for particle picking35.\nExtract particles from the CTF-corrected micrographs.\n\tNOTE: To reduce the computational time required for early, 'clean-up', processing steps, down-scale/bin the particles upon extraction. Details on how run the extract job can be found in the RELION 3.1 tutorial. For this project, particles were initially binned by a factor of 2.\nPerform 2D class averaging. Classifying across 100-200 classes works well for most datasets containing ≥100,000 particles. It is not recommended to use many more than 200 classes or fewer than 50 classes, even where datasets are small unless the sample has high symmetry (i.e., icosahedral virus) in which case fewer than 50 classes might still give a good result. Set the mask diameter large enough to accommodate the longest dimension of the particle, but tight enough to exclude any neighbouring particles (this may require some trial and error).\nSelect good classes (i.e., those with structural details) using the subset selection job. Examples of good and bad 2D class averages can be found in the representative results section.\nGenerate an initial model de novo from the data using the 3D initial model job in RELION.",
    "NOTE: Less clean particle stacks may benefit from multi-reference ab initio SGD (stochastic gradient descent) refinement since this provides an additional opportunity to sift out junk/sub-optimal particles. Select a mask diameter that can accommodate the particle of interest, and leave the default values for fields in the 'SGD' tab since these routinely perform well. Ensure that the initial model looks reasonable in Chimera (or another appropriate visualisation program) (see representative results).\nPerform 3D classification to address heterogeneity in the data using the output from step 6.6 as a reference model. Assess the resulting maps in Chimera. Process particle stacks corresponding to unique conformational states independently. Use the subset selection job to select a class/classes of interest and generate particles.star files for the associated particle stacks.\nRun 3D auto-refinement. Use the 3D class averages obtained in the previous step as references for refinement of their corresponding particle stacks. If the resolution of the refinement is approaching the Nyquist limit of the data, re-extract the particles without down-scaling. After re-extraction, repeat the 3D auto-refine job with the unbinned particle stack. In this case, the 3D reference models must be rescaled such that the pixel and box sizes are consistent with those of the re-extracted particle images. Use the relion_image_handler command line tool to carry out this operation.\nUtilize symmetry in refinement if appropriate. If a reconstructed map possesses symmetry, align the map on the appropriate symmetry axis using the relion_align_symmetry command line tool. Use the resulting aligned map as a reference in a new 3D auto-refinement job with the appropriate symmetry operator specified in the reference tab.",
    "Sharpen maps from 3D auto-refinement. This is done using the post-processing job in RELION, but first a suitable mask must be created from the refined map. The steps of mask creation and post-processing are detailed in the RELION tutorial (see also representative results).\n\tNOTE: The resolution of many reconstructions can be further improved using the Bayesian polishing and CTF refinement functionalities in RELION. Use the CTF refinement job-type to estimate and correct for higher order aberrations (beam tilt, trefoil aberrations and 4th order aberrations) and, as separate jobs, anisotropic magnification and per-particle defocus. Following this, use the Bayesian polishing job (trained or with default values) to address beam-induced motion on a per-particle basis. As addressed in the RELION 3.1 tutorial, these jobs will likely benefit from an iterative approach (CTF-refinement → Bayesian polishing → 3D auto-refinement → post-processing →…loop) since both benefit from higher resolution models.\nCorrect the handedness of EM density maps if necessary. Examine the maps to determine whether the handedness is correct either by attempting to fit an existing atomic model, or assessing the handedness of the alpha helical regions. Where required, flip the map along the z-axis in UCSF Chimera45 using the 'vop zflip' command."
