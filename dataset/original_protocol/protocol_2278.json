    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDrosophila melanogaster 3rd instar larvae whole brain dissection\nTiming: 3 days\nWe first dissect whole brains from 3rd instar larvae. This step is repeated on 3 consecutive days, and the vials that larvae are collected from must be age-matched at 5–6 days old.\nPrepare one 9-well spot plate per phenotype with 750 μL 1× PBS in each spot.\nFrom age-matched experimental tester and control vials, select wandering 3rd instar F1 larvae at the desired time point and place into the top left well.\nRinse the larvae in 1× PBS and separate by sex into the following rows.\nSwirl the larvae in 1× PBS in the well, then transfer to the next well and swirl again to remove excess food and other contaminants from the animal bodies.\nUnder a dissecting stereomicroscope, separate the larvae by sex if desired through identification of gonads on male larvae. Place male and female larvae into the first well of their corresponding row. Refer to Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C for details on sex identification.\nTo begin dissecting, transfer larvae into a clean well and submerge with fresh 1× PBS. Using two pairs of Inox forceps under the microscope, grasp the larvae’s mouth parts using one hand and the lower third of the larval body with the other pair of forceps using the other hand (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1884-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Larval brain dissection for the EGFR-PI3K GBM model\n3rd instar wandering larvae show neoplastic dEGFRλ;dp110CAAX brains labeled by repo>CD8-GFP epifluorescence. For dissections of these larvae, pinch mouth parts with one pair of Inox forceps and pinch the body with another pair of Inox forceps, and pull apart to break open the body and release the nervous system.",
    "Gently pull larvae apart to allow CNS and surrounding tissue to spill out into the PBS pool.\nIdentify the larval brain, which is attached to the mouth parts, and remove excess larval tissues while maintaining a grip on the mouth parts, transferring samples using mouth parts.\nNote: The gut and pharynx remnants should be removed to avoid possible contamination from bacteria, yeast, and food from within the digestive track.\nWhen the brain has been dissected, transfer it into a fresh well with 1× PBS. Repeat the dissection with the rest of the larvae.\nOnce the desired number of larval brains are collected, prepare a 96-well plate with separate wells for each genotype, and separate by males and females if desired (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Pipette 100 μL of freshly prepared 1× PBS 4% paraformaldehyde into each well that will be used, then transfer the brains into the corresponding well.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1884-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Larval brain immunostaining\n96-well plate set up for larval brain immunostaining and storage. Wells containing tissue are denoted in purple. Tape to create an airtight seal as shown.\nAllow the samples to fix for 30–60 min.\nAfter fixation, aspirate the 1× PBS 4% paraformaldehyde using a pipette, being careful not to aspirate or damage the tissue. Discard 4% paraformaldehyde with hazardous chemical waste.\nWash the tissue with 100 μL 1× PBS 0.3% Triton immediately after removing the fixative, and incubate the samples for 10 min. Repeat this step 2 times for a total wash time of 30 min.\nFollowing the final wash, replace with 100 μL 1× PBS 0.3% Triton and 1 pipette drop of 1% sodium azide solution (5–10 μL) to a final concentration of 0.05%–0.1% for preservation.",
    "Using clear tape, tape over the wells in use to create an air-tight seal. Place the plate into a 4°C storage and leave for 24 h.\nPause point: Preserved fixed brains may be stored at 4°C long-term (up to 1 year or more) in this way and reserved for future staining.\nImmunofluorescence staining of Drosophila melanogaster whole larval brains\nTiming: 4 days\nIn this section, we outline the steps for immunohistochemical staining of Drosophila brains using mammalian antibodies. Below, we describe stain procedures for anti-Repo labeling in order to detect all glial cell nuclei. Other primary antibodies or immunofluorescence stains may be used to detect other proteins or genes of interest.\nRemove the dissected larval brains from 4°C storage and remove tape.\nUnder a stereomicroscope, aspirate the 1× PBS 0.3% Triton sodium azide solution from each well to be stained.\nReplace with 100 μL 1× PBS 0.3% Triton 10% NGS 0.1% sodium azide to pre-block the tissue prior to primary antibody staining. Incubate in blocking solution for 30 min.\nAfter blocking, add 50–100 μL primary antibody staining solution. Ensure all tissue is completely submerged in the stain and transparent tape over the plate wells to create an airtight seal.\nOptional: To visualize changes in glial cell numbers, use the anti-Repo primary antibody (1:10, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) which specifically detects a glial-specific transcription factor expressed in repo-Gal4 positive glia and labels neoplastic all glial cell nuclei (Read et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nIncubate brains in primary antibody in 4°C for 48 h.",
    "Note: We have found that longer incubation times of 48–72 h allow primary antibodies to equilibrate deeper into neoplastic brains, which can be denser and thicker than normal wild-type 3rd instar larval brains. Incubation times of 24 h or less does not allow sufficient time for primary antibodies to fully stain neoplastic glia located deeper within tumorous larval brains.\nRemove brains from the 4°C, remove the tape, and aspirate the primary antibody stain.\nNote: Primary antibody solution may be collected, stored at 4°C, and reused to stain other samples as warranted.\nWash the tissue after staining in primary antibodies with 100 μL 1× PBS 0.3% Triton wash solution and incubate for 10 min. Repeat the wash step 3 times, for a total wash time of 30 min.\nReplace the final 1× PBS 0.3% Triton wash with 50–100 μL secondary antibody staining solution. Ensure all tissue is completely submerged in the staining solution.\nNote: Use F(ab’)2 fragments as secondary antibodies to ensure optimal penetration of staining into neoplastic tissues. Recommended secondary F(ab’)2 antibodies are shown in the antibody table above.\nOptional: To counterstain neuronal cell types during the secondary antibody staining step, use a fluorescently conjugated anti-HRP secondary antibody to mark neuronal cell bodies and neuronal fibers (neuropil) (Read et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nTape over the wells to create an airtight seal and store at 4°C for 24 h.\nRemove the tape and aspirate the secondary antibody stain.\nWash the tissue after staining in secondary antibodies with 100 μL 1× PBS 0.3% Triton wash solution and incubate for 10 min. Repeat the wash step 3 times, for a total time of 30 min wash time.\nAspirate final wash solution resuspend the brains in Vectashield antifade and mounting media.",
    "Cover the wells with transparent tape and store at 4°C to allow brains to clear for 24 h.\nNote: We prefer to use Vectashield antifade and mounting media with DAPI, which will cause nuclei to fluoresce in the UV channel, and can be used to image all cell nuclei. DAPI may have spectral overlap with other fluorescent stains, which should be factored into planning all staining and imaging procedures. If DAPI is not required or will overlap with other immunofluorescence stains, we recommend Vectashield antifade mounting media without DAPI.\nPause point: Whole larval brains may be stored in Vectashield at 4°C for up to 3–6 months for future imaging at this stage, depending on the stability of the primary antibody staining.\nImaging Drosophila melanogaster brains using a confocal microscope\nTiming: 1 h\nThese steps outline the optimal way to mount slides and prepare them for imaging.\nPrepare a microscope slide with approximately 100 μL of Vectashield. Several brains can be mounted on one slide.\nRemove immunofluorescence-stained brains from storage and remove tape. Using forceps or a pipette tip, transfer the brains to the microscope slide in Vectashield.\nUnder a dissecting stereomicroscope, hold associated excess larval tissue with forceps and use a surgical razor blade to carefully cut away all excess tissues (imaginal discs, salivary glands) from the brain, including the mouth parts.\nTo keep the imaging field clean, use forceps to remove any excess tissue residue from the slide.\nWhen all brains have been prepared and cleaned, place them all dorsal side up towards the coverslip/ventral side down on the slide, and center brains on the slide.",
    "To support a bridge coverslip that will make a chamber that will protect the brain tissues from being crushed, break a coverslip in half and place each half on each side of the Vectashield pool on the microscope slide, with the flat edges facing the brains.\nCarefully lay another coverslip on top of the two halves to create a bridge that will create a chamber that will preserve brain morphology for imaging (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). Let the coverslips sit for at least 10 min before sealing as described below so that the Vectashield spreads on the glass slide and equilibrates with the coverslips.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1884-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Mounting larval brains on slides for confocal imaging\nSlide mount set up to create a Vectashield chamber to preserve and orient brain tissue for imaging. A coverslip is snapped in half to create the supporting coverslips, and a bridge is created by putting another coverslip over these and sealing with nail polish. To ensure proper seating of the coverslips and firm sealing of the bridge, do not overfill the chamber with Vectashield.\nNote: If the Vectashield does not fill the chamber under the bridged coverslip, more Vectashield can be added with a micropipette, but do not completely fill or overfill the chamber since that will interfere with proper sealing.\nUsing clear nail polish, seal the edges of the bridge around the Vectashield chamber and seal the coverslips to the slide. Let dry.\nNote: Check that coverslips are secure prior to imaging and/or storing. If coverslips are not secure, they can drift during imaging which will shear and damage brain samples. To adjust coverslips, use a razor blade to remove nail polish, blot excess Vectashield, adjust coverslips with forceps, and re-seal.\nSlides can be stored flat at 4°C in a slide holder.",
    "Pause point: Slides may be stored at 4°C for up to 2 months or more, depending on whether/how long alcohols from the nail polish leach into the Vectashield and distorts staining of the tissues.\nImage and optically section brains using a laser confocal microscopy system. Zeiss LSM 700, Zeiss LSM 800, Olympus FV1000, or comparable confocal microscopy systems with multi-channel imaging (488 nm laser, 514–543 nm laser, 633–640 nm laser), z-stacks, and tiling are recommended.\nOptional: Other imaging methods, such as Light Sheet Microscopy, can be used to image whole CNS phenotypes in the larval brain in Drosophila (Lemon et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]), and could be adapted to this GBM model.\nImaging for membrane localized CD8-GFP can clearly visualize glial cell morphology and overall brain morphology (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1884-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

Scale bar indicates 200 μm.\n(A) Genotypes: (A) repo-Gal4 UAS-CD8-GFP and UAS-dEGFRλ UAS-dp110CAAX; repo-Gal4 UAS-CD8-GFP.\n(B) UAS-dEGFRλ UAS-dp110CAAX; repo-Gal4 UAS-CD8-GFP/UAS-dRIOK2dsRNA, UAS-dEGFRλ UAS-dp110CAAX; repo-Gal4 UAS-CD8-GFP, and UAS-dEGFRλ UAS-dp110CAAX; repo-Gal4 UAS-CD8-GFP/UAS-Spzact.\nUse low magnification imaging at 10× or 25× to visualize the entire brain with z-stacks, which can be used for quantitative analyses of brain size and morphology and for qualitative representative images and optical projections for publications.\nCritical: Representative low magnification images for experimental tester brain and control brains should be from age-matched samples from the same experiments to control for variability in larval brain growth between batches.",
    "Use high magnification imaging at 40× or 63× for imaging entire brain hemispheres and subsections of brain hemispheres to examine desired features, such as glial cell nuclei or cell morphology, preferably using thin optical sections (∼ 1 μm) and an objective with a long working distance to obtain crisp, in focus sections and deep z-stacks.\nNote: For imaging larval brain hemispheres, we use a water immersion 40× objective and take z-stacks of 25–45 1 μm slices starting from very cellular superficial areas going into deeper regions that encompass central brain neuropil.\nFor high magnification imaging of Drosophila larval brains with glial neoplasia, multiple images will be needed to capture an entire brain hemisphere because brain hemispheres in the GBM model may be larger than the field of view of the objective.\nNote: Gain, laser power, and z-stack settings should remain constant while imaging multiple fields from the same brain so that a composite whole brain hemisphere can be stitched together using automated tiling software or manual photo-editing software, such as Photoshop.\nFor processing high magnification z-stack imaging data, serial section subsets, can be used to create thicker representative optical projections to highlight features of interest, such as glial cell morphology or mitotic figures, to perform quantitative image analyses, and to include as qualitative representative images for publications (Figures 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A and 7B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1884-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

    "(A and B) Genotypes: (A) repo-Gal4 UAS-CD8-GFP and (B) UAS-dEGFRλ UAS-dp110CAAX; repo-Gal4 UAS-CD8-GFP.\nNote: Representative images for experimental tester samples and age-matched control samples should be matched for brain orientation, section plane, section thickness, and brain region to allow for valid comparisons (Read et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nOptional: To create representative images of brain hemispheres for publication, we typically select 2–4 serial 1 μm optical section subsets from z-stacks of 40× images and create optical projections from these subsets (Read et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9])."
