    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nFunctionalizing the nanobodies site specifically with the chelator DFO\nTiming: 1 day\nIn this step, the nanobody will be labeled with the chelator deferoxamine (DFO), later used for binding radioactive 89Zr. Since we intend to also functionalize the nanobody with a PEG moiety via a click reaction, the described DFO substrate also contains an azide group. Note that the functionalization with PEG is optional (see next section). A DFO substrate without an azide group should be used, if PEGylation is not planned.\nNote: If the nanobodies will not be functionalized with a 10 kDa or 20 kDa PEG, their blood half-life will be short enough to allow imaging using a radioisotope with a shorter physical half-life than that of 89Zr. In that case, exposure to the workers and animals’ might be reduced. Chelators such as DOTA and NOTA, can be used to bind various radioisotopes, including 68Ga and 64Cu. Alternatively, nanobodies can be directly functionalized with 18F (t1/2 of ∼110 min). (Rashidian et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Senders et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8])\nNote: Trace amount of metals such as iron can efficiently bind DFO, hindering the chelation of 89Zr. Therefore, these impurities of metals should be removed from all reagents and solutions used in these steps.\nRemove metal impurities from the nanobodies using Chelex beads.\nChelex 500 mL of PBS pH 7.4 by adding 5 grams of Chelex beads and gently stir the suspensions using a magnetic stir bar for at least 8 h at 4°C. Chelex treatment may raise the pH of buffers, check the pH of the Chelexed PBS and acidify with TraceSELECT HCl if necessary.\nDialyze a solution containing at least 2 mg of nanobodies against 500 mL of PBS containing 5 grams of Chelex beads for 16 h while stirring at 4°C.",
    "Remove metal impurities from the purified sortase 7M using Chelex beads.\nDialyze a solution containing sortase 7M against 500 mL of PBS containing 5 grams of Chelex beads for at least 16 h while stirring.\nUse sortase to functionalize the nanobodies with the Gly3-azide-DFO substrate.\nTo a tube containing the Chelexed nanobody at a concentration between 2–4 mg/mL, add the following sequentially:\nGly3-azide-DFO substrate to a final concentration of 1–2 mM.\nChelexed sortase 7M to a final concentration of 5 μM. Allow the reaction to proceed for 2 h at 4°C.\nCritical: The Gly3-azide-DFO substrate must be dissolved in DMSO or Chelexed PBS to limit the presence of metals.\nNote: Progress of the reaction can be monitored via either mass spectrometry or anti-His western blotting and looking for the loss of His-tag. The sortase reaction usually reaches >90% conversion within 2 h. If the reaction has not reached >80% conversion after 2 h, the Gly3-azide-DFO and sortase concentrations can be increased an additional 1 mM and 5 μM, respectively.\nPurify the DFO-labeled nanobody from sortase.\nAdd 200 μL of Ni-NTA beads that have been washed 3 times with Chelexed PBS (100 μL of bead slurry for each 0.5 mL of reaction mixture).\nAdd Chelexed PBS (1.5 mL, pH 7.4) containing 200 μL beads to a 2 mL Eppendorf tube.\nResuspend the beads by inverting the tube 5–10 times.\nCentrifuge for at least 30 s at 300 × g and remove the supernatant.\nAdd fresh Chelexed PBS (1.5 mL) and repeat steps ii and iii.\nIncubate the beads in the reaction mixture for 5 min while agitating the tube at 4°C.\nCentrifuge the suspension for at least 30 s at 300 × g and collect the supernatant.\nWash the beads 3 times with Chelexed wash buffer, 0.20 mL each time.",
    "Combine the supernatant and wash solvent and purify the product by PD-10 desalting column, which has been thoroughly equilibrated with Chelexed buffer prior to use (see steps 11–13 for general instructions on using PD-10 columns). To ensure efficient removal of the excess substrate, we do not recommend applying more than 0.5 mL of reaction mixture per PD-10 column. Elute the nanobody using Chelexed PBS and collect 0.5 mL fractions. Determine the nanobody concentration in each fraction by measuring their absorbance at 280 nm. The nanobody typically elutes in fractions 5–8 (when 2.5–4.5 mL of PBS has already been added on top of the column after the sample is loaded).\nOptional: Instead of a PD-10 column, size-exclusion chromatography can be used to purify the nanobody in step 4e. The column should be thoroughly washed with Chelexed PBS buffer before use.\nFunctionalizing the DFO-labeled nanobody with PEG\nTiming: 3 h\nThis step is optional.\nFunctionalizing nanobodies with PEG decreases their kidney uptake, which is likely due to their increased hydrophilicity. PEGylation also increases nanobodies’ blood half-lives, which can enhance the signal-to-background ratio obtained during nanobody-PET imaging. However, it also prolongs the time required to reach a relatively stable nanobody biodistribution, at which meaningful PET images can be obtained. In this manner, nanobodies’ pharmacokinetics can be tuned by employing PEG chains of different molecular weights. For examples on how PEG length influences PEGylated nanobodies’ in vivo behavior please see (Rashidian et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6], 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7])",
    "Add DBCO-PEG (5 kDa, 10 kDa or 20 kDa) to the nanobody-functionalized with the azide-DFO substrate (approximately 1–2 mg/mL) to reach 1.0 molar equivalents compared to the nanobody. Let the reaction proceed for 1 h at 4°C. DBCO-PEG should be added as a solution in Chelexed PBS (1–5 mM stock). This reaction is typically quantitative, if desired any trace amounts of unreacted PEG can be removed using an FPLC thoroughly washed with chelexed buffer.\nCritical: All buffers that come into contact with the DFO-labeled nanobody must be Chelexed.\nPerform SDS-PAGE to verify if PEGylation has been completed. As PEG increases the nanobodies’ molecular weight, the product will move slower on the gel than the starting material. The DBCO-azide click reaction, when performed in the above concentration range, usually reaches conversions of >95% within an hour, after which it is considered complete. If necessary, the reaction time can be extended and more DBCO-PEG added.\nNote: To ensure PEGylation does not affect the nanobody’s cellular specificity, we recommend imaging animals that lack the expression of protein of interest (knockouts). Alternatively, a blocking experiment involving pre-injecting animals with non-radiolabeled nanobody before imaging with the radiolabeled PEGylated nanobody can be performed. In either case, a significant decrease in PET signal intensity will confirm that the PEGylated nanobody has retained its specificity. Binding analyses by flow cytometry or in vitro cell binding assays can also be performed.\nRadiolabeling DFO-functionalized nanobodies with 89Zr\nTiming: 1.5 h\nRadioactive 89Zr is chelated by DFO-functionalized nanobodies, unchelated 89Zr removed, and the radiochemical purity of the radiolabeled nanobodies determined. The procedure is identical regardless of nanobody PEGylation.\nNote: Necessary precautions for working with high-energy gamma radiation should be taken. These include, but are not limited to, receiving appropriate training, shielding radioactive sources, and monitoring workers’ exposure.",
    "Prepare a solution of 0.5–2.0 mg DFO-functionalized nanobody in 200 μL HEPES buffer (0.5 M, pH 7.5).\nDilute an 89Zr-oxalate solution in 1 M oxalic acid (1.0–1.5 miliCurie (mCi), <20 μL) with Chelexed PBS 300 μL and adjust its pH to 6.8–7.5 using a Chelexed aqueous Na2CO3 solution (2 M).\nNote: Typically, a volume of aqueous Na2CO3 solution equal to approximately 45% of the volume of 89Zr4+ oxalate solution needs to be added to reach the desired pH. The pH is best checked by pipetting 0.5 μL of the solution to pH paper with a minimum resolution of 0.5 pH units.\nAdd the neutralized 89Zr solution to the nanobody-DFO solution, mix well, and check if the pH remained between 6.8 – 7.5. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]\nIncubate the mixture for 60 min at 25°C using a thermomixer shaking at 350 rpm.\nOpen a disposable PD-10 size-exclusion cartridge and wait until the storage buffer has eluted. Equilibrate the column by applying 5 times 3 mL of PBS and waiting until this has eluted.\nLoad the nanobody-DFO solution (approx. 0.55 mL) on the PD-10 cartridge and wait until it has entirely run into the column. Add 2 mL of PBS and again wait until this has entirely run into the column. The eluent at this stage should not contain any activity and can be discarded.\nAdd 0.5 mL PBS and collect the 0.5 mL eluent in an Eppendorf tube. Repeat 9 times.\nMeasure the activity in each fraction and the column using a dose calibrator. Typically, the radiolabeled nanobodies elute as a clear peak in fractions 2–6, followed by free 89Zr in fractions 8–10. Some activity typically remains on the column.",
    "Optional: Depending on the desired injected dose, some fractions that contain 89Zr-labeled nanobody-DFO at a relatively low concentration can be discarded before combining the remaining fractions.\nCut thin-layer chromatography (TLC) paper into a 0.5 × 7.5 cm strip and spot approximately 1–2 μL of the radiolabeled nanobodies 1.0 cm from one end. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]\nAdd 1 mL of an aqueous disodium EDTA (50 mM) to a 50 mL Falcon tube and gently place the TLC strip inside with only the tip of the spotted end submerged in the solution.\nRemove the TLC paper after the disodium EDTA solution has run to 0.5 cm of the top end of the strip (∼5 min) and let dry for several min.\nOptional: To reduce the risk of contamination, wrap the developed TLC strip in cellophane before radio-TLC analyses.\nPlace the strip in a radio-TLC scanner and measure the activity over the length of the strip. Radiolabeled nanobodies should remain at the baseline (i.e., have a retention factor (Rf) of 0), while any unbound 89Zr elutes with the solvent front (i.e., have a Rf of 1).\nIntegrate the peaks belonging to the radiolabeled nanobody and free 89Zr and calculate the radiochemical purity by dividing the area of the nanobody peak by that of the combined nanobody and free 89Zr signals. The radiochemical purity is typically >97%. The decay-corrected radiochemical yield of the entire radiolabeling procedure is typically >80% (0.8–1.3 mCi).\nOptional: The radiochemical purity of the product can also be determined by radio size exclusion HPLC. In this case, we advise using PBS as eluent and injecting at least 50 μCi of sample.",
    "Pause Point: The radiolabeled nanobodies should be either directly injected or stored in the dark at 4 °C. Although the nanobodies remain stable for at least a week under these conditions, their specific activity will diminish due to 89Zr’s radioactive decay (t1/2 = 78 h). As a result, higher nanobody doses will need to be administered to obtain the same PET signal intensity, which might negatively impact their specificity.\nIntravenous nanobody administration and circulation\nTiming: 15 min for injection followed by 2.0, 3.0, 6.0, or 24 h circulation for no-PEG, 5 kDa-PEG, 10 kDa-PEG or 20-kDa PEG-functionalized nanobodies, respectively.\n89Zr-labeled nanobodies are intravenously injected in mice and allowed to circulate for periods of time depending on their PEG functionalization.\nPrepare a dose of 89Zr-labeled nanobody.\nUsing a 0.5 mL insulin syringe, draw approximately 200 μCi (approx. 50 μL) of 89Zr-labeled nanobody.\nRecord the exact amount of activity using a dose calibrator as well as the measurement time. Dilute the dose to 150 μL with PBS.\nPlace the dose in a lead-shielded syringe holder for transfer.\nCut approximately 6 inches of catheter tubing. Using a pair of scissors, remove the plastic tip of a 27G × 1 1/4 needle and insert this into one end of the catheter. Fill a 1 mL insulin syringe with PBS and connect the PBS-filled syringe to the catheter on the side opposite of the needle. Advance the syringe until contrast flows out of the needle to ensure removal of air from the catheter.\nInject the mouse with 89Zr-labeled nanobody.\nWhen housing multiple mice in the same cage, mark each mouse using a unique ear tag, ear punch, or pen stroke on its tail.\nPlace the mouse under a heat lamp or on a heating pad for at least 5 min.",
    "Place the mouse in a restrainer and turn on the fiber optic illuminator.\nFind the lateral tail vein and rub the area with an alcohol swab to induce vasodilation.\nPlace the catheter needle in the tail vein and inject the nanobody dose. Swap the empty dose syringe for a 1 mL insulin syringe filled with PBS. Use approximately 50 μL PBS to flush any remaining activity into the mouse.\nRecord the time of injection.\nRemove the needle and wipe any pooling blood with a Kimwipe. Place the mouse back in its cage.\nCollect the Kimwipe, catheter, needle, and empty nanobody syringe in a 50 mL Falcon tube (and any other items that might be contaminated with the nanobody dose). Place the Falcon tube in a dose calibrator and record the time and activity.\nAllow the administered 89Zr-labeled nanobodies to circulate for the desired time.\nNote: Make sure to label the mouse cage with a radioactive tag. Fasting is not necessary for this radiotracer.\nPET imaging of mice injected with 89Zr-labeled nanobodies\nTiming: 1 h\nThe biodistribution of the radiolabeled nanobodies is non-invasively monitored by PET imaging.\nWeigh the mouse and record its weight.\nPlace a catheter to inject CT contrast agent.\nPlace the mouse under a heat lamp or on a heating pad for at least 5 min.\nDraw Isovue-370 iodine contrast agent into a 1.0 mL insulin syringe. Cut 1.5 ft of a catheter, remove the plastic component of a separate 27G × 1 1/4 needle, insert this needle into one end of the catheter, and the contrast-containing syringe into the other. Advance the syringe until contrast flows out of the needle to ensure removal of air from the catheter.",
    "Place the mouse in a restrainer and turn on the fiber optic illuminator. Find the lateral tail vein and rub the area with an alcohol swab to induce vasodilation.\nPlace the needle in the tail vein and check if it is appropriately placed. The syringe’s plunger may need to be pulled outward to observe blood flow and confirm placement, as Isovue-370 is quite viscous. Secure the needle in the vein using tape.\nInduce anesthesia by placing the animal in an induction chamber. Set the oxygen flow at 1 L/min and the isoflurane vol.% at 1.5–2.0.\nPrepare the PET scanner.\nCreate a new file and use a protocol that includes a scout scan, CT, and PET.\nSet the CT voxel size to the minimum available setting. Ensure the whole mouse gets covered by one CT planning bed and use a similar size PET bed.\nInput details about the mouse and radioactive dose, including the initial nanobody dose, 89Zr’s physical half-life, remaining activity in the used syringe, time points of the various dose measurements, as well as the bodyweight of the mouse.\nPlace the animal in the scanner.\nPlace the mouse in a prone and head first position. Ensure that the respiratory monitor is located on the abdomen and that the respiratory signal is appropriately monitored.\nFor anesthesia during the scan, set the oxygen flow at 1 L/min and the isoflurane vol.% at 1.5. Monitor the animal’s respiratory rate while it is in the scanner, approximately 80–100 bpm is ideal.\nPlace the Isovue-370 syringe in an automated syringe pump. Program the pump to inject at 0.05 mL/minute and ensure that the correct syringe size has been selected.\nPerform a scout scan to aid in positioning the field of view for CT and PET imaging.",
    "Start injecting contrast agent using the syringe pump and wait 15 s before starting the CT scan to allow the contrast to circulate. Make sure all investigators are behind a lead shield. Stop the syringe pump when the CT scan is finished. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]\nInitiate a 30-minute PET scan and continue monitoring the animal’s respiratory rate. Take the mouse out of the scanner when the PET is finished. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]\nReconstruct the obtained PET data as a static acquisition with the highest possible number of iterations and the smallest available voxel size.\nOptional: If the PET scanner has a bed heater it is advised to use it during the scan.\nNote: Depending on the organ of interest, ECG- or respiratory-gated PET scans might be preferred. If examining the bone marrow or spleen, ungated PET scans are usually sufficient.\nEx vivo gamma counting of radioactive organs\nTiming: 30 min\nThe animals are sacrificed and their organs separately gamma counted to quantify nanobody uptake.\nLabel and weigh 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes, one for each organ of interest per mouse. Use a scale that is accurate to at least 10-5 grams.\nPlace the mouse in an induction chamber, set the oxygen flow at 1 L/min and the isoflurane vol.% at 2.5–3. Confirm the depth of anesthesia by pinching the toes of the mouse with forceps. The absence of reflex retraction of the leg indicates that the animal is fully anesthetized. Subsequently, perform cervical dislocation to humanely euthanize the mouse.\nSecure the mouse in a supine position on a dissection tray.\nOpen the thorax and abdomen, draw blood for gamma counting and potential other assays, and perfuse the animal with 20 mL PBS through the left ventricle.\nCollect organs of interest and place these in the corresponding pre-weighed vials.",
    "Weigh the vials containing the organs.\nPut the vials in a gamma counter and measure their activity while using an open field filter and measuring counts per minute (CPM).\nNote: We recommend weighing the empty tubes before adding the organs, as there might be a small but significant difference between their weight (weight full – weight empty = sample weight). This is especially important for light tissues, including lymph nodes.\nNote: When interested in bone marrow activity, it is recommended to analyze the bone marrow separate from the bone. To do so, snap off the ends of the femur, perforate the bottom of a 0.5 mL Eppendorf polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tube, and feed the open end of the femur through the hole. Subsequently, place the PCR tube inside the pre-weighed 1.5 mL Eppendorf. Spin the vials for approximately 30 s in a small centrifuge using the quick spin function to extract the bone marrow.\nEx vivo autoradiography of radioactive organs\nTiming: 20 min + several min to days of exposure\nAutoradiography allows determining the regional distribution of radioisotope deposition in both tissue samples and histological sections with sub-millimeter resolution. Staining adjacent sections for relevant cellular and molecular markers enables directly comparing distribution patterns.\nPrepare tissues of interest for autoradiography.\nThoroughly rinse tissue samples to prevent a false signal from blood clots.\nDry the tissue samples before placing them on plastic foil.\nExposing samples with hugely varying amounts of activity in the same film cassette will complicate optimizing their exposure time. Therefore, sort the samples by the amount of activity they contain.\nOptional: Large tissues can be sectioned to facilitate both histological and autoradiographic analyses. To achieve this the following procedure can be followed:\nCut the tissue in smaller samples around 5 millimeters thick.",
    "Embed the sections in Optimal Cutting Tissue (OCT) Compound in a mold and put them on dry ice for at least 10 min. Avoid air bubbles as much as possible during the embedding.\nUsing a cryotome, cut one thick (>10 μm) section and as many adjacent sections as needed for staining with other markers. The thickness of the adjacent sections depends on the desired histological staining protocol. Clean the cryotome regularly to prevent cross-contaminating the samples with activity.\nThe thicker sections should be used for autoradiography, thinner ones for histological or fluorescent analyses.\nPrepare autoradiography cassette and plate\nCheck that the cassettes used for tissue exposure are clean and free of any trace radioactivity. Before use, blank the phosphor imaging plates using the image eraser to remove remnants of previous exposures, an erasure time of 60 min is typically used.\nLine the bottom inner side of the cassette with plastic film.\nPlace the tissue samples or slides in the desired order over the lined bottom side of the cassette. It might be necessary to take several autoradiographs to accommodate for differences in required exposure time.\nTake a picture of the sample/slide layout for future reference during analysis.\nCarefully cover the samples/slides with another layer of plastic film. This will prevent contamination of the phosphor imaging plate.\nOptional: Plates can be read after blanking to make sure previous images have been completely erased.\nExpose the phosphor imaging plate to the samples\nPlace the phosphor imaging plate on top of the samples, with the imaging side (white) facing the samples.\nCarefully lock the cassette and place it in a freezer (−20°C).\nMake sure the freezer is free of any other radioactive material as this can cause background signal spill.",
    "Expose the plates between 2 h and several days, depending on the 89Zr-labeled nanobody dose injected and its accumulation in the tissue of interest.\nRead the phosphor imaging plate.\nCarefully open the cassette and remove the phosphor imaging plate, avoiding excessive light exposure.\nQuickly secure the plate onto the magnetic holder, with the imaging side (white) facing down.\nPlace the holder with the plate in the phosphor imager tray (Typhoon 7000IP plate reader GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA) and close the lid.\nSet the reading parameters at the maximum attainable pixel resolution (25 μm for Typhoon 7000IP).\nRead the plate, save the file, and check the image quality. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]\nAnalyzing data from PET imaging, gamma counting, and autoradiography\nTiming: 2 h (varies depending on the number of animals)\nData analyses for comparing – and potentially correlating – the PET, gamma counting, and autoradiography results.\nPET imaging data analyses.\nImport data to image analysis software (e.g., OsirixMD or Horos).\nOpen the CT and PET data in the 2D viewer and ensure that both PET and CT images are displayed in the same orientation.\nConvert the PET scan data to standardized uptake values (SUV) by selecting “convert to SUV” and inputting mouse body weight, scan time, and activity of the injected dose.\nOn CT, use the pencil tool to draw regions of interest (ROIs) around the organ of interest every 3–4 slices and label each ROI set with the corresponding name (e.g., bone marrow, spleen, liver, etc.). To interpolate ROIs between slices, select “generate missing ROIs”.\nDrag the small icon atop the CT window over to the PET scan to copy ROIs. Scroll through the scan to ensure that the ROIs are properly aligned and export SUV values for every ROI.",
    "Open the produced .csv file in any spreadsheet program and average all SUVs for each respective organ. For organs with homogenous signal distribution, such as the spleen, liver, or bone marrow, utilize ROIMean. For organs with a more heterogeneous distribution of PET signal, such as the heart, utilize ROIMin or ROIMax.\nGamma counting data analyses.\nCalculate the injected 89Zr-labeled nanobody dose at the time of injection (pre-injection activity minus the remaining activity in the empty syringe). Make sure to correct for decay to the time of injection.\nConvert the injected dose from μCi to CPM, by making a calibration curve between the dose calibrator (μCi) and gamma counter (CPM) results. This curve should be made anew after any maintenance or intervention on the gamma counter.\nDecay-correct the CPM values obtained by gamma counting of the tissues to the time of injection. This way both the injected activity and activity in the tissues are expressed as CPM and decay-corrected to the time of injection.\nCalculate the activity in a specific organ as a percentage of the total injected dose (%ID).\nDivide the %ID by the weight of each sample to calculate the percentage of the injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g). This unit resembles the SUVmean values obtained by PET imaging.\nAutoradiography data analyses.\nQuantification of the autoradiography images can be performed using ImageJ software, freely available from the National Institutes of Health.\nDivide larger tissues into equal areas to facilitate comparison with similar areas analyzed by PET.\nFor histological correlation, create a mask of the autoradiography image and quantify the image intensity based on the grayscale.\nRepeat the steps for the adjacent sections, which have been histologically or fluorescently stained.\nCompare the intensity of the staining within the identical areas and calculate the correlation coefficient.",
    "Note: For details on how to compare autoradiography results with PET or histological data, please see (Senders et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nOptional: For improved accuracy in quantitative autoradiographic analyses, a calibration curve can be generated by exposing a ladder of standards of known activity, spotted on TLC paper, together with the samples. However, we recommend that all quantitative analyses should be based on gamma counting and PET imaging results."
