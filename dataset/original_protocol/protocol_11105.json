    "All procedures described were performed in accordance with the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Surgical Guidelines and had been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\n1. Casting the silicone window \nPrepare the silicone polymer (PDMS) by mixing the base elastomer and curing agent in a 10:1 (v/v) ratio.\nCast a window by depositing a small quantity of PDMS on a sterile, smooth surface and adjust the volume-to-area ratio to the desired thickness.\n\tNOTE: Using 200 mg of polymer solution for a 22 mm diameter circle on the lid of a 24 well-plate lid results in a good compromise between window sturdiness and optical clarity.\nOptional: To provide landmarks for repeated imaging of the same tissue regions, lightly press a stainless-steel grid into the silicone after the PDMS is on the desired casting surface.\nTo remove air bubbles, place the coated surface in a vacuum desiccator for 45 min to degas the polymer.\nCure the silicone windows in an oven at 80 °C for 45 min.\nScore the polymer at the edges of the mold and gently peel the cured windows from the surface used for casting with forceps.\nBefore surgery, sterilize the windows by autoclaving.\n2. Preparing the mouse for insertion of the silicone window \nAnesthetize the mouse in an induction chamber using 4% (v/v) isoflurane. Move the mouse to a warming pad on the surgical table, place the mouse in the anesthesia nose mask, and lower the isoflurane concentration to 2% for maintenance throughout the surgery.\nCheck the depth of anesthesia by pinching the toes of the hind limbs. Do not proceed until the mouse is inactive and does not show toe pinch reflex response.\nApply ophthalmic lubricant to the eyes to keep them from drying and preventing trauma.",
    "Administer pre-emptive analgesia (buprenorphine 0.05 mg/kg) subcutaneously.\nShave the surgical site and completely remove the hair with a hair removal cream.\nApply povidone-iodine solution (10% v/v) and ethanol (70% v/v) consecutively 3x to prevent the surgical site infection.\n3. Inserting a ventral window for imaging in the liver; adaptable for other abdominal organs (Figure 1) \nPlace the mouse in the supine position.\nMake a 10 mm incision starting 3 mm down from the xiphoid process using sterile scissors and forceps.\nRemove a 1–1.5 cm2 section of skin along the midline.\nUse a second pair of sterile scissors and forceps to remove a section of the peritoneum slightly smaller than the section of skin.\nOptional: To visualize a larger portion of the liver, use sterile cotton swabs moistened with sterile saline to push the liver down from the diaphragm revealing the falciform ligament connecting the liver to the diaphragm. Sever the ligament taking care not to cut the inferior vena cava.\nWithdraw surgical adhesive with a 31 G syringe, apply a small quantity of it on the surface of the liver around the edges of the area to be imaged. This adhesive creates a circular seal, leaving the center area intact for imaging.\n\tCAUTION: Limit the adhesive to small droplets forming a circular pattern around the imaging area. Tissue immediately in contact with the adhesive cannot be imaged. It is not necessary to dry the tissue before applying the adhesive.\n\tNOTE: Any cyanoacrylate-based adhesives can be used successfully for this procedure. Surgical adhesive ensures sterility. For terminal procedures, all-purpose super glues yield good results.\nPosition the window using forceps and hold it firmly against the liver until the adhesive has dried (~2 min).\nFold the edges of the window under the peritoneum.",
    "With a syringe, deposit a small quantity of surgical adhesive on the edges of the window that are now under the peritoneum. Push down on the peritoneum with forceps to secure it to the window.\nSimilarly, deposit a small quantity of surgical adhesive onto the peritoneum before pushing down on the skin with forceps to secure it to the peritoneum.\n\tNOTE: If performed correctly, a circular area of liver tissue should now be visible through the window.\nApply glue around the edges of the window to create a rim that will help prevent the skin from growing back over the window.\n\tCAUTION: If the procedure is carried out using sterile surgical techniques and the window is sterilized before insertion, sealing the wound with surgical adhesive is sufficient to avoid infections. However, failure to follow proper aseptic techniques during surgical insertion or imperfect closure can lead to overt or subclinical infection and drying out of the tissue.\n4. Inserting a lateral window for imaging in the liver; compatible with the concurrent injection of cancer cells in the portal vein (Figure 2)\nPlace the mouse on the left lateral decubitus position\nMake a 10 mm incision on the right flank 3 mm below the costal arch using sterile scissors and forceps.\nRemove a 1 cm2 section of skin.\nUse a second pair of sterile scissors and forceps to remove a section of the peritoneum slightly smaller than the section of skin.\nWithdraw surgical adhesive with a 31 G syringe, apply a small quantity of it on the surface of the liver around the edges of the area to be imaged.\n\tCAUTION: Limit the adhesive to small droplets forming a circular pattern around the imaging area. Tissue immediately in contact with the adhesive cannot be imaged.",

Push down on the peritoneum with forceps to secure it to the window.\nSimilarly, deposit a small quantity of surgical adhesive onto the peritoneum before pushing down on the skin with forceps to secure it to the peritoneum.\n\tNOTE: If performed correctly, a circular area of liver tissue should now be visible through the window.\nApply glue around the edges of the window to create a rim that will help prevent the skin from growing back over the window.\nIf a portal vein injection is required:\n\t\nPlace the mouse in the supine position.\nMake a 10 mm incision starting down from the xiphoid process in the skin.\nUsing a second pair of sterile scissors and forceps, make a 10 mm incision in the peritoneum.\nDip two cotton swabs in sterile saline.\nUse the cotton swabs to gently pull the intestine onto sterile gauze moistened with sterile saline, taking care not to twist or otherwise upset the orientation.\nKeep displacing the intestine from the abdominal cavity until the portal vein is visible on the right side of the abdomen.\nInsert a 31–33 G needle 5–7 mm caudal to the point of entry of the portal vein into the liver, making sure to proceed within the blood vessel and not through it.\nSlowly inject the cancer cells (resuspended in 100 μL of sterile PBS).",
    "NOTE: For this experiment amurine pancreatic cancer cell line (e.g., KPC-BL/6-1199) can be cultured in complete DMEM media and 1 x 105 cells injected in 100 μL of sterile PBS.\nTo prevent bleeding, immediately after withdrawing the needle, apply gentle pressure on the injection site with a small piece of surgical sponge for 1–2 min.\nAfter the pressure is released, monitor the site for 1–2 min to ensure hemostasis.\nUsing moistened cotton swabs, return the intestine into the abdominal cavity following the physiological orientation of the organ.\nUsing sterile forceps, insert the window immediately under the peritoneum, on the left side of the abdominal cavity of the mouse.\nSuture with 4-0 silk sutures and staple the midline incision with 7 mm stainless steel wound clips.\nMove the mouse to the left lateral decubitus position\nMake a 10 mm incision on the right flank 3 mm under the costal arch through the skin using sterile scissors and forceps.\nRemove a 1 cm2 section of skin around the incision.\nUse a second pair of sterile scissors and forceps to remove a section of the peritoneum slightly smaller than the section of skin.\nPull the window into place over the liver before gluing it in place, as described under steps 4.8–4.10.\n5. Inserting the window for imaging in the pancreas (Figure 3) \nPlace the mouse on the right lateral decubitus position.\nMake a 10 mm incision on the left flank 3 mm below the costal arch using sterile scissors and forceps.\nRemove a 1 cm2 section of skin around the incision.\nUse a second pair of sterile scissors and forceps to remove a section of the peritoneum slightly smaller than the section of skin.",
    "Using sterile cotton swabs soaked with sterile saline, gently pull on the spleen to visualize the pancreas. Proceed to reposition the pancreas with the moistened cotton swabs to make more surface area visible through the incision.\n\tNOTE: At this point, pancreatic cancer cells can be orthotopically injected into the pancreas if it is a part of the experimental design.\nWithdraw surgical adhesive with a 31 G syringe, apply a small quantity of it on the surface of the pancreas around the edges of the area to be imaged.\n\tCAUTION: Limit the adhesive to small droplets forming a circular pattern around the imaging area. Tissue immediately in contact with the adhesive cannot be imaged.\nPosition the window using forceps and hold it firmly against the pancreas until the adhesive has dried (~2 min).\nFold the edges of the window under the peritoneum.\nWith a syringe, deposit a small quantity of surgical adhesive on the edges of the window that are now under the peritoneum. Push down on the peritoneum with forceps to secure it to the window.\nSimilarly, deposit a small quantity of surgical adhesive onto the peritoneum before pushing down on the skin with forceps to secure it to the peritoneum.\n\tNOTE: If performed correctly, a circular area of pancreas tissue should now be visible through the window.\nApply glue around the edges of the window to create a rim that will help prevent the skin from growing back over the window.\n6. Inserting the window for imaging in the mammary gland (Figure 4)\nPlace the mouse on the supine position.\nMake a 10 mm incision medial to one of the inguinal nipples using sterile scissors and forceps.\nRemove a 0.5 cm2 section of skin above the mammary gland.",
    "Use a second pair of sterile scissors to carefully separate the mammary gland from the skin by spreading the scissors between the two surfaces to disrupt adherence.\n\tNOTE: To facilitate imaging of the inguinal mammary gland area, be careful to dissect a portion of skin above the mammary gland but superior to the hind leg, so the window does not limit the mobility of the mouse.\nWithdraw surgical adhesive with a 31 G syringe, apply a small quantity of it on the surface of the mammary gland around the edges of the area to be imaged.\n\tCAUTION: Limit the adhesive to small droplets forming a circular pattern around the imaging area. Tissue immediately in contact with the adhesive cannot be imaged.\nPosition the window using forceps and hold it firmly against the mammary gland until the adhesive has dried (~2 min).\n\tNOTE: A circular area of mammary gland tissue should now be visible through the window if performed correctly.\nFold the edges of the window under the skin.\nWith a syringe, deposit a small quantity of surgical adhesive on the edges of the window that are now under the skin. Push down on the skin with forceps to secure the skin to the window.\nApply glue around the edges of the window to create a rim that will help prevent the skin from growing back over the window.\n7. Post-surgical recovery \nPlace the mouse in a clean recovery cage with ample nesting material, ensuring that part of the cage is resting on a heating pad.\nMonitor the mouse continuously until it is conscious and mobile.\nIf needed, provide an additional dose of analgesic 12 h after the pre-emptive dose.",
    "NOTE: Additional analgesia is generally unnecessary, but consult with a veterinarian if the mouse shows signs of distress (such as hunched back, unkempt fur, or lost interest in food). Monitor the mouse daily for the first 3 days after surgery for signs of infection or other adverse effects. Less than 2% of mice require veterinary attention or euthanasia, typically due to partial detachment of the window. It is important to note that for male mice with ventral liver imaging windows, fighting between mice can result in detachment of windows. This is avoided by housing the mice separately.\n8. Imaging through the window\nAnesthetize the mouse in an induction chamber using 4% (v/v) isoflurane.\nApply ophthalmic lubricant to the eyes to keep them from drying and preventing trauma.\nMove the mouse from the induction chamber to the microscope stage. Place the mouse in the anesthesia nose mask, and lower the isoflurane concentration to approximately 1–1.5% for maintenance anesthesia throughout the imaging procedure.\nPlace a pressure pad sensor below the mouse to monitor breath rate and fix the mouse to the stage using soft surgical tape.\nInsert a rectal thermometer to monitor body temperature throughout the imaging session.\nTurn on the heated pad, monitoring the mouse closely to ensure that body temperature does not exceed 37 °C.  \nUtilize software to monitor the breath rate of the mouse. The optimal rate is ~1 breath/second. Adjust anesthesia as required.\nBefore each imaging session, clean the window from any residual lens immersion medium and debris by gently wiping it with a cotton swab dipped in 70% ethanol (v/v).\nWhen utilizing a water immersion lens, apply ultrasound gel to the window, avoiding bubbles.\n\tNOTE: Distilled water can also be used but might require reapplication during imaging.",
    "To find the optimal depth for imaging, first, locate the grid and place it in focus.\nDetermine the approximate tissue imaging depth by setting the bottom of the grid to 0. This information is necessary to locate the corresponding z plane in subsequent imaging sessions.\nTo identify the same location over multiple imaging sessions, utilize the squares on the grid as a reference point. During imaging, note the orientation of the grid and location within the grid of each field of view imaged (e.g., 2nd row from the top, 4th square from the left).\nDuring successive imaging sessions, use the grid to navigate back to specific grid areas - and thus imaging fields.\nFollowing each imaging session, remove any residual lens immersion medium and debris by gently wiping the window with a cotton swab dipped in 70% ethanol (v/v).\nSubscription Required.
