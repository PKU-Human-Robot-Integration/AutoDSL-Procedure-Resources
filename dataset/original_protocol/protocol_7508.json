    "AgRP ablation Weigh the mice at P5.Dissolve the diphtheria toxin powder in water or saline (0.90% w/v of NaCl) to a final concentration of 5 μg/mL (stock solution).Inject subcutaneously a dose of 5 μg/kg in heterozygous and homozygous mice for the selected mutation (expression of the diphtheria toxin receptor in AgRP neurons) (Figure 1). The preferable site for injection is over the shoulders, into the loose skin over the neck. A new needle should be used for each animal to reduce the risk of site infection. Allow full absorption of the substance before putting back the mouse into the cage.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4730/bioprotoc-13-15-4730-g001.jpgFigure 1. Ablation of AgRP neurons by diphtheria toxin injections on P5 in the arcuate nucleus. Both control and AgRPDTR/+ mice were injected as pups with DT (50 μg/kg) on P5. Representative immunostaining of ARC neurons of control (WT) and AgRPDTR/+ mice are shown. The asterisks indicate third ventricle. Scale bar, 50 μm. AgRP: Agouti related peptide. DTR: diphtheria toxin receptor. ARC: arcuate.Weigh the mice and their food intake daily up to day 21 to assess standard growth.Activity-based anorexia model Place cages in a temperature-controlled room dedicated only to ABA testing. Set the light timers to the 12:12 h light/dark cycle.Cage setup: clean the cage and the running wheel with 70% ethanol and afterward dry with a paper towel. Add the bedding (up to 4 cm) and the in-cage running wheel. Verify that the wheel can freely turn without touching the bedding.Insert the infrared sensor on the side of the running wheel and connect it to the DP1224.Boot the computer and start the running wheel software by double-clicking on the icon.Label every cage and the corresponding sensor in alphabetic or numerical order.",
    "Set up the configuration of the data acquisition (a detailed data acquisition software manual is available online from Starr Life website).Single-house 36-day-old mice in a cage containing bedding, a water bottle, and ad lib food.Allocate the mice in two groups:Running group have ad lib access to food and water and access to the running wheel.Sedentary group have ad lib access to food and water without access to the running wheel.Acclimation: allow animals to acclimate for four days.For the following four days, measure weight and food intake every morning.Use a dedicated container for the food, to avoid food contamination with feces and urine. Minimize the time that each cage is moved, weighing first the food and afterward the mouse from the same cage. When removing the mouse from the cage, manually stop the running wheel to prevent recording biased running wheels counts.Food restriction (72 h/three days).Approximately at noon on the fourth day of acclimation, remove the food from both groups (sedentary and running).Before the onset of the dark phase, pre-weigh 50 g of pellet. Store food at room temperature in cups labeled with the mouse ID and cover with aluminum foil. Use a fresh pellet for every day of food restriction to avoid contamination.At 7:00 pm, when the lights are usually turned off, place the pre-weighed pellets in the overhead food bin of each cage for 2 h.At 9:00 pm, carefully remove the leftover pellets, place it in the labeled containers, and cover with aluminum foil. Clean the food bin with a dry paper. Wear a red headlamp while you are in the room during the dark phase.In the morning after food restriction, weigh the mice and the food intake from the leftover pellet. Ensure that there is no food left in the bedding of the cage.",
    "To determine weight loss, calculate the % baseline body weight dividing the current weight by the body weight recorded on the last day of acclimation. Any mouse that loses more than 25% of its body weight is at risk of death and must be removed from the experiment. Mice removed from the experiment are placed in a new cage without the running wheel and with ad lib food and water.Recovery: approximately at noon of the third day of food restriction, remove all remaining mice from the experiment and place them in a new cage without the running wheel and with ad lib food and water. Allow the animals to recover for at least one week before undergoing additional behavioral testing.Under the File menu in the VitalView program window, click “stop acquisition.”"
