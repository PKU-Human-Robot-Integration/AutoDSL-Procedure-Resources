    "NOTE: R.L. obtained ethical approval for the explantation of organs from the Landesamt für Gesundheit und Soziales (LaGeSo). Livers were explanted from Wister rats. The inferior vena cava and the portal vein of the liver were cannulated with a 22 G cannula. Methods for the decellularization of explanted livers have been described previously.4,5 The extracellular matrices used here were obtained by excessive perfusion of a rat liver with 1% sodium deoxycholate.\n1. Recellularization of Extracellular Matrix (ECM) of a Rat Liver\nExpansion of hepatic cell line HepG2\n\t\nCulture the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, and 2 mM of penicillin and streptomycin, each.\nSeed 1.5 x 107 cells in T175 bottles and grow the cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Harvest cells after 4 days by trypsinization for 5 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nSpin down the cells at 300 x g and resuspend them in 4 ml PBS and count the cells with a Neubauer chamber under a microscope. One T175 bottle will yield approximately 4.5 x 107 cells.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure the culture contains sufficient cell numbers for recellularization of the rat liver ECM with 6 x 108 HepG2 cells per ECM (10 x 175 cm2 culture flasks with 4-5 x 108 cells each).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54633/54633fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Bioreactor system. A) This bioreactor system was custom-made. It maintains the organ models at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The flow rates of the peristaltic pumps can be regulated individually. B) The liver is placed in a growth chamber and connected to the perfusion circuit, which consists of a peristaltic pump, a medium reservoir, a bubble trap and a pressure sensor.

    "Recellularization of the ECM\n\t\nSet up the bioreactor system, containing a liver perfusion chamber, a perfusion system, a reservoir of medium and a bubble trap. Sterilize the bioreactor system (121 °C, 15 min).\nConnect the bioreactor system with a peristaltic pump and place it in an incubator providing appropriate conditions (37 °C, 5% CO2). Place decellularized rat liver scaffolds8 in the liver perfusion chamber of the bioreactor system (Figure 1).\nConnect the cannulated portal vein and vena cava using tube clips to the perfusion system. Equilibrate scaffold with 150 ml RPMI medium (as described in 1.1) over 5 d with a flow rate of 1.25 ml/min.\nDisconnect the liver scaffold from the media circuit and inoculate the scaffold with 3 x 108 HepG2 cells (in 5 ml) via the portal vein using a 5 ml syringe, avoid air bubble formation and allow the cells to repopulate the ECM by incubating them for 1 hr in the scaffold with the pump switched off.\nGradually increase the flow rate by adjusting the pump, starting with 1.25 ml/min for 10 min; 2.5 ml/min for 20 min and finally 3.75 ml/min for 30 min.\nRepeat steps 1.2.4-1.2.5 to reach a total cell number of 6 x 108.\nRun the bioreactor system at a flow rate of 3.75 ml/min. Culture the recellularized rat liver for 2 weeks.\n\t\tNOTE: Replace one third of the medium with fresh medium (50 ml) every other day. Sample the culture medium to measure physiological parameters, such as lactate dehydrogenase activity, the pH of medium samples and the concentration of glucose and lactate.\n2. Transduction of the Recellularized Rat Liver\nLarge-Scale Production of AAV Vectors\n\t\nProduce, purify, and quantify AAV vectors as described previously:11",
    "Briefly, produce AAV vectors in roller bottles and purify them by iodixanol gradient centrifugation. Remove residual iodixanol by filtration over PD10 gel filtration columns. Determine the AAV vector concentration by qPCR using genomic AAV DNA as a standard.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The self-complementary, pseudotyped AAV2/6 vector used in the present study encoded EmGFP as a reporter to demonstrate transduction efficiency and an shRNA expression cassette for the knockdown of an endogenously expressed gene (human cyclophilin B (hCycB), Figure 2). Ensure a sufficient amount of pseudotyped scAAV vectors of serotype 6 (2.7 x 1013 AAV vectors per liver model).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54633/54633fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Map of the self-complementary, pseudotyped AAV2/6 vector used in the present study. The genome consists of the inverted terminal repeats (ITR) of AAV2 and encodes EmGFP under control of the CMV promoter as well as an shRNA under control of a U6 promoter.

Connect a 5 ml syringe to the cannula of the portal vein and inject the complete AAV vector solution (5 ml).\n\t\tNOTE: Optionally, add phenol red (5 µg/ml) to follow the distribution of the AAV vector solution throughout the liver.\nIncubate for 1 hr without pumping. Gradually increase flow rate, starting with 1.25 ml/min for 10 min; 2.5 ml/min for 20 min and 3.75 ml/min for 30 min. Culture the recellularized rat liver over 6 days.\n\t\tNOTE: Replace one third of the medium as given in NOTE under 1.2.7\n3. Assessment of the Recellularized Transduced Rat Liver",
    "Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and Immunohistochemical Analysis\n\t\nTake samples (0.5 x 0.5 x 1.5-2 cm) from each liver lobe using a scalpel.\nIncubate samples (from 3.1.1) in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) + 4% sucrose solution for 1.5 hr at 4 °C. (Caution: PFA is toxic and carcinogenic. Always keep PFA within a fume hood and wear appropriate protective clothing.) Wash three times with PBS (1 min per wash step) and incubate in 8% sucrose overnight at 4 °C.\nPour fixing medium into plastic cryomolds, place the samples into fixing medium free of air bubbles. Add fixing medium until sample is well covered. Store embedded samples at -80 °C until further use.\nPrepare cryo-sections (10 µm) with a cryotome12. Assess recellularization by hematoxylin + eosin staining8. Assess transduction efficiency by immunohistochemical staining for the gene-of-interest (here: EmGFP).\nMolecular biological sampling\n\t\nSample each liver lobe with a biopsy punch (4 mm in diameter). Isolate total RNA, DNA and proteins according to the manufacturer's instructions for the assessment of transgene expression of EmGFP, and hCycB knock down8."
