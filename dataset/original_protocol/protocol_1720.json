Preparation of E. coli membrane fraction and solubilization of rhodopsins with SMA\n(A) E. coli cells expressing RxR.\n(B) Disruption of E. coli cells by ultrasonication. The beaker containing the sample is cooled in ice-cold water.\n(C) Membrane fraction of E. coli cells expressing RxR.\n(D) Membrane fraction of RxR is solubilized with SMA. The suspension is stirred using a magnetic stirrer.\n(E) SMA-solubilized fraction of RxR collected after centrifugation.\n(F) HisTrap FF column after the SMA-solubilized fraction containing RxR is loaded on the column.\nNote: When you use the frozen membranes, place it at room temperature for 1–2 h until the pellet is thawed.\nDisrupt the cells in a 100 mL beaker using an ultrasonic disruptor (60 pulses/min for 30 min, Duty: 50, Output control: 7, UD-2119, TOMMY SEIKO Co., Ltd., Japan) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]\nCritical: Cool the samples in ice-cold water during the ultrasonication.\nTransfer the suspension to 30 mL centrifuge tubes.\nCentrifuge the tubes (5,000×g) for 10 min at 4°C and collect the supernatants into clean30 mL centrifuge tubes.\nCentrifuge the tubes (40,000×g) for 60 min at 4°C and pour off the remaining supernatants.\nCollect the precipitates as the membrane fraction (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nExtraction of rhodopsin molecules with SMA\nSuspend the collected membranes with ca. 10 mL Buffer AN for RxR or Buffer BN for HsSRI using plastic pipettes.\nHomogenize the suspension using a glass-Teflon Dounce homogenizer (Labo-Stirrer LR 41A, Yamato Co., Japan).\nTransfer the suspension to a 10 mL beaker.",
    "Add SMA (final concentration = 5 % w/v) to the suspension.\nCritical: Add the polymer to a buffer above pH 7.4 containing a low salt concentration (below 500 mM) for the solubilization because the polymer forms aggregates under low pH and high salt conditions.\nNote: If you need to change the lipid composition of SMA lipid particles, add the exogenous lipids in addition to SMA.\nStir the suspension (RxR: for 2 h at room temperature (23°C–28°C), HsSRI for 30 min at 4°C) with a magnetic stirrer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nNote: Since RxR and HsSRI are not significantly denatured by room light, it is not needed to perform this step in the dark. However, when you solubilize other unstable rhodopsins, we recommend to perform the steps after the solubilization in the dark.\nTransfer the suspension to 30 mL centrifuge tubes. Centrifuge the tubes (103,900×g) for 30 min at 4°C and collect the supernatants as the solubilized fraction (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E). Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]\nCritical: Perform the extraction steps of HsSRI at 4°C or on ice to prevent protein denaturation.\nPurification of rhodopsin molecules in SMA lipid particles\nTiming: 2 days\nPurification of rhodopsin molecules by affinity column chromatography\nWash a HisTrap FF column (5 mL, Cytiva) with 5 column volumes (CV) of Milli-Q water.\nNote: The flow rate was set at 1–3 mL/min in steps a – e.\nWash the column with 3 CV Buffer AN for RxR or Buffer BN for HsSRI.\nApply the lysate containing rhodopsins to the column (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F). Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]\nWash the column with 3 CV Buffer AW for RxR or Buffer BW for HsSRI.\nElute the column with a linear gradient of imidazole in Buffer AE for RxR or in Buffer BE for HsSRI using a chromatography system (ÄKTA prime plus, ÄKTA purifier 10, GE Healthcare).",
    "Note: The detector of the chromatography system is set to monitor the absorption at 541 nm for RxR and 535 nm for HsSRI.\nCollect the red-colored fractions corresponding to each absorbance peak containing rhodopsins.\nCritical: Perform the column chromatography steps of HsSRI at 4°C to prevent protein denaturation.\nMeasure absorption spectra of the collected samples using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2450, Shimadzu, Japan) to confirm the purity and amounts of rhodopsins.\nRemove imidazole from purified RxR samples\nBuffer exchange and concentrate the samples with an Amicon Ultra filter (30,000 Mw cut-off; Millipore). Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]\nAdd more than a 100-fold volume of Buffer AN and gently mix the solution using a pipet.\nRepeat steps a – b two more times.\nCritical: Use a buffer above pH 7.4 for the purification because the polymer forms aggregates under low pH conditions, especially during the steps of concentrating the samples.\nMeasure absorption spectra of the sample using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2450, Shimadzu, Japan) to estimate the concentration by using the absorbance at 541 nm with molar extinction coefficient of RxR (54,000 M−1 cm−1) (Kanehara et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nRemove imidazole from purified HsSRI samples\nPlace the samples into a dialysis membrane (Wako, Dialysis membrane Size 8, MWCO: 14,000).\nImmerse the dialysis membrane in more than a 100-fold volume of Buffer BN for 4 h at 4°C.\nExchange Buffer BN to fresh Buffer BN and incubate for 4 h at 4°C.\nRepeat step c two more times.\nConcentrate the samples with an Amicon Ultra filter (30,000 Mw cut-off; Millipore) at 4°C. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]\nCritical: Use a buffer above pH 7.4 for the purification because the polymer forms aggregates under low pH conditions, especially during the steps of concentrating the samples.",
