  "procedures": [
    "S1m tagging Optimal site for S1m insertion/fusionThe S1m aptamer sequence can be inserted in any region of the RNA of interest, but one has to make sure the tag will be available for purification. The streptavidin-binding aptamer must be properly folded, and the tertiary structure of the RNA and/or associated proteins must not interfere with the binding of streptavidin to the S1m aptamer. If the RNA structure and/or binding sites for RNA-binding proteins are known, place the S1m sequence in a non-conserved, exposed RNA region (Walker et al., 2008). In addition, the junction sites for the 5′- and 3′-ends of the S1m aptamer should be close in space to allow proper folding of the aptamer.We advise trying at least two distinct aptamer insertion sites and assessing which one leads to the most efficient purification. In case of RNase MRP, fusion to the 5′ or 3′ termini of the RNase MRP RNA appeared to be more efficient than insertion at an internal position. It should be noted that placing the affinity tag at the 5′ or 3′ position might decrease the RNA stability due to exonuclease degradation.Moreover, it is necessary to adjust the promoter to the gene of interest (pol I, II, or III) and to consider the required expression level. An inducible system such as a doxycycline-inducible RNA polymerase promoter might be desirable to avoid overexpression and unwanted effects.Tag gene of interest with S1m tagInsert the S1m aptamer sequence at the selected location(s) in the gene of interest, using a standard PCR-based strategy. The sequence of the S1m aptamer is AUGCGGCCGCCGACCAGAAUCAUGCAAGUGCGUAAGAUAGUCGCGGGUCGGCGGCCGCAU. This sequence can be commercially synthesized as an oligonucleotide and cloned by the use of restriction enzymes, as it was done for RMRP (for details, see Derksen et al., 2022).",
    "Another method is to add the aptamer sequence to the primers used for the amplification of the gene of interest and use PCR amplification and fusion-based cloning (such as In-Fusion®) to add the tag directly in the sequence of the gene of interest. This second method is faster, easier, and allows the introduction of the aptamer at any desired location.Confirm insertion of the aptamer by restriction digestion and gel electrophoresis.Note: We decided to use the S1m aptamer, which is a modified S1 aptamer containing an extended perfect strand complementarity in comparison with the original S1 basal stem, leading to a 2-fold higher affinity for streptavidin (Leppek and Stoecklin, 2014). Bacterial transformation and purificationOnce you obtain plasmids containing the insert, transform competent bacteria (e.g., E. coli TOP10) with the tagged gene following standard bacterial transformation protocols (Green and Rogers, 2013). Grow bacteria overnight on LB agar plates containing the appropriate antibiotics.The next day, pick single colonies and perform colony PCR to verify that they contain the correct plasmid.Inoculate bacteria from a single colony in 100 mL of selective medium and grow overnight at 37 °C in a shaking incubator at 200 rpm.Purify the plasmid from the bacterial culture using the Qiagen Plasmid Midi kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions.Confirm the sequence of the construct obtained by sequencing (e.g., Sanger sequencing).Check the concentration and purity of the plasmid by spectrometry and agarose gel electrophoresis.Note: Expected 260/280 and 260/230 ratios are >1.8 and >2.0, respectively. A lower 260/280 ratio may indicate protein or phenol contamination, and a lower 260/230 ratio may indicate contamination by organic compounds. Store purified plasmids at -20 °C or use directly for transfection (step B2).Cell culture and transfection Seed adherent HEK293T cells at 10% confluency in 150 cm2 dishes with 40 mL of complete DMEM medium.",
    "Around 24 h after seeding, when cells are approximately 20% confluent, transfect them with the S1m-containing construct generated in step A:Per 150 cm dish, mix in this order: 4 mL of Opti-MEM, 40 μg of DNA, and 120 μL of 1 mg/mL of PEI.Note: A PEI:DNA ratio of 3:1 (w/w) was optimal for transfection of RNase MRP constructs, but this has to be optimized for each construct to reach the optimal expression levels. Adapt the quantities for transfection in accordance with the surface area, considering 1 μg of DNA per milliliter of culture medium. As a mock control, transfect a dish with the same quantities of Opti-MEM and PEI without DNA.Incubate at room temperature for 30 min.Add the mixture dropwise to the cells and mix by swirling gently.Optional: If the transfected plasmid expresses Gaussia or Renilla luciferase, assess transfection efficiency by measuring luciferase expression level. Twenty-four to forty-eight hours after transfection, harvest 200 μL of culture medium and assess luciferase activity using the BioLux® Gaussia Luciferase assay kit following the manufacturer’s instructions.Forty-eight hours after transfection, harvest the cells by trypsinization.Remove the culture medium.Add 150 µL of 1× trypsin-EDTA per 10 cm2 dropwise to the cells at room temperature and incubate for 2–3 min at room temperature until more than 90% of the cells are detached.Add at least four volumes of pre-warmed complete DMEM medium to deactivate the trypsin and centrifuge at 500–1000 × g for 5 min.Wash the pellet once with at least three volumes of PBS.Note: The cell pellet can be stored at -20 °C. Purification of S1m-tagged complexes Streptavidin purificationLyse the harvested cells by resuspending the pellet in 1 mL of S1m lysis buffer and incubating on ice for 5 min.Sonicate 10 times in the bioruptor on high power for 30 s to shear genomic DNA.",
    "Centrifuge at 11,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and transfer the supernatant to a new tube to separate from insoluble material. Insoluble material can be discarded.Add 1 mL of S1m incubation buffer.Transfer 10% of the lysate to a new tube labeled as Input material for western and northern blotting analyses.Note: The amount of material to save at this stage depends on the expression level of the complex of interest, purification efficiency, and number of analyses. For RNase MRP, we used 0.6% of input material for western blotting analysis, and 1% for northern blotting analysis. Add the lysate and 3 μL of RNasin to 40 μL of packed pre-equilibrated streptavidin Sepharose beads. To pre-equilibrate the beads, wash them three times with 0.5 mL of S1m wash buffer and centrifuge at 800 × g for 2 min.Incubate overnight at 4 °C under agitation using a rotary mixer.Centrifuge at 800 × g for 2 min at 4 °C and transfer 10% of the supernatant to a new tube labeled as Non-bound material for western and northern blotting analyses.Note: Save the same amount as for the Input.Wash the beads three times for 5 min with 1 mL of S1m wash buffer by incubation at 4 °C under agitation and centrifugation at 800 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. The wash fractions can be discarded.During the last wash, split the resuspended beads into two tubes, to use one for protein extraction and the other for RNA extraction.Protein extraction from purified materialCentrifuge one of the two tubes to pellet the beads and discard the supernatant.Add 20 µL of 4× protein sample buffer directly to the beads.Note: The amount of material to load on each gel depends on the purification efficiency.",
    "For RNase MRP, we used 10%–25% of bound material for western blotting analysis. Store the purified material at -20 °C or use directly for western blotting (step D2).RNA extraction from purified materialCentrifuge the second tube to pellet the beads and discard the supernatant.Add 1 mL of TRIzol reagent directly to the beads and isolate the RNA following the manufacturer’s instructions.Note: We recommend performing an additional extraction step of the aqueous phase with one volume of chloroform and adding 10 µg of glycogen or GlycoBlue as a carrier during precipitation. Dissolve the RNA in 10–30 µL of RNase-free water.Store the purified RNA at -80 °C.Note: The amount of material to load on each gel depends on the purification efficiency. For RNase MRP, we used 15% of bound material for northern blotting analysis. Identification of the composition of purified material Northern blottingVerify the presence of your tagged RNA of interest by northern blot hybridization. The probe used to detect the RNA of interest should lead to the detection of both the endogenous RNA and the tagged RNA, in order to compare their expression levels. The analysis of a non-related RNA is recommended. This can serve as a loading control for the input fractions and to have a reference for the specificity of RNA purification.Here, we describe the procedure for northern blotting using an α-32P-labeled RNA probe (riboprobe), the most sensitive and specific type of radiolabeled probe. For RNAs expressed at a high level, 32P 5′-end-labeled DNA oligonucleotides or non-radioactive (e.g., fluorescently labeled) RNA or DNA probes can also be used. For detailed protocols describing these methods, see Tabor and Struhl (2001) and Franke et al. (2015), respectively.Probe cloningInsert (part of) the sequence of the RNA of interest in a plasmid, using a standard PCR-based strategy.",
    "The probe should be at least 100 nucleotides long. The vector should contain an in vitro transcription promoter (such as the promoter for T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase) upstream of the sense sequence of the RNA of interest, to generate a complementary probe after transcription. For RMRP, the pGEM-3Zf plasmid containing the complete sense sequence of RMRP downstream of the T7 promotor was used.Once you obtain the plasmid containing the probe sequence, follow steps A3a–g to amplify and purify the plasmid.In vitro transcriptionLinearize the plasmid by digestion with the appropriate restriction enzyme cleaving downstream of the probe sequence.Purify the linearized plasmid by 25:24:1 phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation [for details on the protocol, see Suchan (2020)].Confirm linearization by agarose gel electrophoresis. Load both the circular and linear plasmid on the same gel and compare the size of the bands. The linear plasmid should migrate at a different position compared to the circular plasmid.Mix in the following order: RNase-free water (volume resulting in a total reaction volume of 20 µL), 2 µL of 100 mM DTT, 4 µL of 5× transcription optimized buffer, 2 µL of IVT NTP mix, 40 U of RNA polymerase, 2 µL of RNasin (80 units), 2 µL 32P-α-UTP (3000 Ci/mmol), and 1 µg of linearized plasmid.Incubate for 1 h at 37 °C.Purify the in vitro–transcribed probe using a Sephadex G50 column following the manufacturer’s instructions.Measure the amount of radioactivity in the purified probe and the column using a Geiger counter.Note: The radioactivity level should be higher in the purified RNA probe than in the column; the opposite indicates sub-optimal production of the labeled probe. Gel electrophoresisThis protocol describes the procedure for the use of a polyacrylamide gel, but an agarose gel can also be used.",
    "Additional information can be found in more detailed protocols (Petrov et al., 2013).Prepare a polyacrylamide RNA denaturing gel.Pre-run the gel in 1× TBE for 30 min at 30 mA.Add one volume of RNA sample buffer to the Input, Non-bound, and purified RNA samples from transfected and non-transfected cells and incubate for 5 min at 95 °C to denature the RNA. Place samples back on ice immediately.After pre-running, clean the slots using a syringe and load the samples.Run the gel at 30 mA.Note: The running time depends on the size of the RNA molecules of interest. Use the colored dyes to determine when to stop running the gel (Petrov et al., 2013). For RNase MRP RNA, the gel should be run until the dark blue dye (bromophenol blue) reaches the bottom of the gel. RNA blotting and detectionTransfer the RNA to a Hybond N+ membrane in northern blotting buffer for 1 h at 500 mA at room temperature.Allow the blot to dry and crosslink the RNA to the membrane by UV irradiation at 700 mJ/cm2.Note: Store the blot dry between filter paper at 4 °C if needed. Block the blot for 1 h at 65 °C with pre-hybridization buffer.Add the RNA probe to the pre-hybridization buffer and incubate at 65 °C overnight.Wash the blot twice with 1× SSC and 0.2% SDS, using enough buffer to cover the whole blot.Wash the blot once or twice with 0.1× SSC until no radioactivity is detected anymore at regions of the blot where no signal is expected.Wrap the blot in plastic foil and put it in a cassette with a Phosphor Screen.Develop with a phosphor imager to visualize the result (for an example see Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4615/bioprotoc-13-04-4615-g002.jpgFigure 2. Northern blot analysis of S1m-tagged RNA.",
    "HEK293 cells were transfected with a S1m-RMRP construct to transiently express the tagged RNA and cultured for 24 or 48 h before extracting total RNA with TRIzol. As a control (- plasmid), cells subjected to the transfection procedure without the plasmid construct were used. Equal amounts of RNA were separated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and both wild-type and S1m-tagged RMRP were detected using a radiolabeled probe complementary to RMRP.Western blottingProtein gel electrophoresisPrepare an SDS-PAGE gel [see Recipes and detailed protocol in Sambrook and Russell (2006)].After polymerization, remove the comb carefully and clean the slots using a syringe.Mix one volume of Input and Non-bound material with three volumes of 4× protein sample buffer.Load the Input, Non-bound, and purified protein samples after 2–5 min incubation at 95 °C and centrifugation to remove insoluble material.Note: Load up to 15 μL for a 0.75 mm thick gel and up to 30 μL for a 1.5 mm thick gel. Run the gel in SDS-PAGE running buffer at 90 V constant for approximately 15 min, until the dye reaches the bottom of the stacking gel. Then, run at 150 V constant for approximately 50–60 min, until the dye reaches the bottom of the running gel.Remove the gel from the running apparatus, carefully remove one of the glass plates and cut off the stacking gel.Protein blottingAssemble the transfer cassette: anode (-); foam mat; two sheets of Whatman paper; gel; nitrocellulose membrane; two sheets of Whatman paper, foam mat; cathode (+).Note: Soak all Whatman papers and the membrane in western blotting buffer before assembling the blotting sandwich. Avoid any air bubbles between the anode and cathode and gently remove any using a roller before closing the cassette to ensure efficient transfer on the whole surface of the blot. Insert the cassette into a blotting apparatus.",
    "Add an ice pack in the apparatus or keep the apparatus cold during the transfer.Transfer the proteins to a nitrocellulose membrane in western blotting buffer with magnetic stirring for at least 1 h at constant 100 V or overnight at constant 250 mA.Note: For thick gels (1.5 mm), transfer for at least 1.5 h. After transfer, remove the blot from the cassette and briefly incubate in Ponceau-S solution until clear bands appear for the Input and Non-bound fractions. Rinse the blot a few times with demineralized water and make an image of the stained blot.ImmunodetectionBlock non-specific antibody binding by incubating the membrane in 10 mL of blot blocking solution at room temperature for at least 30 min with gentle shaking.Discard the blocking solution and add the primary antibody diluted to working concentration in 5–10 mL of blocking solution. Incubate for at least 1 h at room temperature or ideally overnight at 4 °C, with shaking or rotation.Wash the membrane three times for 5 min with 10–20 mL of PBST.Add the IRDye® 800CW- or 680RD-conjugated secondary antibody diluted to working concentration in 5–10 mL of blocking solution. Incubate for at least 1 h at room temperature, protected from the light.Note: Ensure that the secondary antibody used is targeted against immunoglobulins of the organism of origin of the primary antibody. Wash the membrane two times for 5 min with 10–20 mL of PBST.Briefly wash the membrane with 10 mL of PBS and keep it in PBS protected from the light until imaging.Note: We observe that after rinsing the membrane with PBS, less background fluorescence is observed when imaging. Detect the fluorescence using the Odyssey imaging system or Typhoon imager with the 700 nm or 800 nm channel, depending on the secondary antibody used."
