    "Methods/Procedure setup\nWe  included 32 patients with drug-refractory paroxysmal AF and three patients with  persistent AF. Informed consent was obtained from all patients before the  procedure.\nAblation Procedure\nAll  patients are anticoagulated at least 1 month prior to the procedure. Warfarin is  stopped the day prior to the procedure aiming for an international normalized  ratio between 1.8 and 2.0 on the day of the procedure. Antiarrhythmic drugs are  continued periprocedurally and for three months post procedure. All patients undergo  cardiac MRI or cardiac CT imaging before the procedure to assess the left  atrial and pulmonary vein anatomy and allow for measurement of PV diameter.\nThe  ablation procedure is performed under conscious sedation. Electrograms are  recorded in a specialized EP recording system (EP Med, St Jude Medical, MN, US).\n1. Procedure Setup\nThe  patient is draped in the standard way for ablation procedures. Vascular access  is obtained in the right and left femoral veins. Systemic arterial pressure is  continuously monitored via the left femoral artery through a pressure  transducer. The intracardiac (ICE) ultrasound probe (Acuson, Siemens, GER) is  advanced to the right atrium.\nUsing  standard Fluoroscopic views and ICE guidance, trans-septal puncture is obtained  using a Preface (Biosense Webster, CA) or SL1 sheath (St Jude Medical, MN). A J  tipped 0.035\" wire is placed in the left superior PV and the trans-septal  sheath is exchanged with the Flexsheath. Before trans-septal access, heparin bolus  is infused intravenously and then repeated as needed based on ACT checks  performed every 20 min to maintain an activated clotting time over 350 sec  for the duration of the procedure.",
    "Balloon  size is selected in accordance with the diameter of the PVs based on cardiac  MRI or cardiac CT measurements pre procedure. Typically, a 28 mm cryoballoon is  utilized if any of the PV ostia has a diameter larger than 20 mm.\nAfter  appropriate preparation, the cryoballoon is advanced over a wire or the Achieve  catheter (Biosense Webster, CA) in the left atrium and then, using ICE and  fluoroscopic guidance, into the antrum of each PV.\nThe  balloon has an inner lumen that is typically used for radioiodine contrast  injection through the distal tip of the balloon. A continuous pressure  monitoring system is connected to the lumen to allow for pressure waveform analysis.  Specifically, a 3-way Manifold  (Navylist Medical, CA) (Figure 1) is attached via a Tuohy (Merit Medical, IRE)  to the cryoballoon. Removal of air bubbles from the system is critical and care  is taken to thoroughly flush the system prior to utilization. The three ports  of the manifold are 1. saline flush (under pressure), 2. contrast and 3. pressure  monitoring. The pressure monitoring port is then connected to a standard cardiac  catheterization laboratory pressure transducer. The pressure waveforms are displayed  on the EP recording system live monitor (Figure 2).\nThe  LA pressure recordings are set at a scale of 25 mmHg and sweep speed at 50  mm/sec. The page has minimal number of channels displayed (one or two surface ECG  derivation, CS electrograms and arterial and LA pressure). Electrograms of the  PV-LA junctions are recorded prior to ablation (either using the Achieve  catheter or a separate multipolar catheter). Continuous recording is displayed  on a separate page on the EP system when occlusion is assessed.\n2. PV Occlusion",
    "The  deflated balloon is advanced over the guide-wire or Achieve catheter using  standard fluoroscopic views and intracardiac ultrasound and is inflated on the  LA side of the PV antrum.\nThe  pressure page is displayed and the pressure line is opened to the transducer  such that pressure is recorded from the tip of the balloon catheter (which  dwells in the vein at this stage).\nWhen  the balloon does not occlude the ostium of the PV, a characteristic LA pressure  is recorded. During sinus rhythm, A (atrial) and V (ventricular) waves are  recorded with the V wave having a typical \"isosceles triangle\" morphology.  During atrial fibrillation however, there is no consistent A wave generated  (since there is no atrial contraction) and only the V wave morphology is seen. Using  fluoroscopy or ultrasound guidance the balloon is advanced and placed in  apposition with the PV ostium.\nWhen  occlusion is achieved, there is an abrupt change in the pressure waveform.  During sinus rhythm there is a loss of the A wave and a change of amplitude  (increase) and morphology of the V wave. Since now the recording is that of  trans-capillary pulmonary arterial pressure, the V wave has the typical  characteristic of a more rapid rate of rise and a delayed downstroke. In fact  the apex of the V wave triangle moves to the right when compared to the LA  pressure V wave recording. This is evident in sinus rhythm (Figure 3) and  atrial fibrillation (Figure 4). This characteristic pressure waveform confirms complete  occlusion and no further forward pressure or catheter manipulation needs to be  used. Contrast use at this time may be utilized for further confirmation of PV  occlusion during initial use of this methodology.",
    "Once  occlusion has been achieved, the freezing process can be started. During ablation of right-sided PVs, phrenic  nerve pacing is performed from a catheter located in the superior vena cava in  order to promptly detect phrenic nerve injury. For the first approximately 15 sec (depending on local blood flow),  pressure can still be recorded. Once temperature monitor reaches -10 degrees Celsius,  the inner lumen of the balloon freezes and pressure can no longer be recorded.  At this stage, we toggle the recording system page to the intracardiac  electrogram page to demonstrate \"time to effect\" of PV isolation. Cryoapplication  is continued for 240 sec.\nAfter  the freezing process is complete and thawing has occurred, pressure can again  be recorded and the maneuver can be repeated the number of times deemed  necessary for permanent PV isolation.\nAfter  cryoablation, every PV is mapped using a 20-pole circular mapping catheter with  variable diameter (Biosense Webster, CA). If remnant ostial potentials are  still recorded, differential pacing of the atrium near the vein is performed to  prove entrance block in the PV. In case of persistent conduction, electrical  isolation is completed segmentally using an 8-mm cryoablation catheter (Freezor  MaxR, Medtronic, MN) or an irrigated radiofrequency catheter (ThermoCool,  Biosense Webster, CA). The endpoint of the procedure is complete electrical PV  isolation, documented at least 30 min after the last application.\nPostablation Care\nAfter  the procedure, warfarin is resumed and subcutaneous low molecular weight  heparin is administered if necessary until the international normalized ratio is  â‰¥2.0. Warfarin is continued for at least 3 months. Clinical follow up was  performed at six weeks, three months, six months and twelve months and included  ECG at each visit and event monitoring at three months. Long term antiarrhythmic  and anticoagulation therapy was determined by clinical outcomes."
