    "The FlexiVentFX™ system is a modular system where different modules are connected to the main chassis (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.488#cpz1488-fig-0002]–C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.488#cpz1488-fig-0002]), which handles all communication with the attached computer.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/17e531b2-48f5-43c0-80a7-ad227aa4b3a1/cpz1488-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nFlexiVentFX™ System main chassis. Parts of the base unit with the cover closed (A) and opened (B). The back view of the base unit (C) with zoom shot on I/O ports (D).\nFor the different types of measurements, different combinations of modules are necessary. Except for the FX modules, all modules are connected with the I/O ports on the main chassis. They have to be attached to the right I/O port to function properly. For this purpose, the I/O ports and the plates attached to the cables of the modules have been color-coded with a little colored label (Fig. 2C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.488#cpz1488-fig-0002] and D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.488#cpz1488-fig-0002]).\nFor all (dis-)assembly procedures, the system needs to be switched off with the power switch on the main chassis (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.488#cpz1488-fig-0002]).

The latter only has two plastic attachments with O-rings and cannot be used for measurements, as it does not connect to the pressure transducer. For this protocol, you will need the tubing ports without nebulizer mount.\nConnect the tubing assembly if necessary.\nUsually the tubing remains attached to the tubing port. If this is not the case, put two pieces of tubing on the metal tubes of the tubing port.\nFor measurements with single animal: Connect the tubing on the other end to the Y-shaped connector (Fig. 6A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.488#cpz1488-fig-0006]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/bb6e63c3-8296-47a2-9532-1869bb77e465/cpz1488-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\nDifferent types of tubing ports for the FX1 module (A) and FX2 module (B).",

    "The Mpxv7002dp is designed to measure positive and negative pressure: -2 to 2 kPa (-0.3 to 0.3 psi) corresponding to 0.5 to 4.5 V output. The high-level output analog signal is proportional to the applied air pressure created by breathing, as an example. A displacement at a specific voltage, i.e., 2.5 V, allows pressure and vacuum sensing. This explains how incorrect intubation of the animal into the esophagus can create negative pressure due to movement of the diaphragm, while a correct intubation into the lungs produces air pressure changes (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.488#cpz1488-prot-0004]). Follow the instructions of the manufacturer for configuration.\nThe core of the module is a microcontroller unit (MCU) in Arduino Nano V2.0. Program the MCU following the instructions of the manufacturer. Arduino Nano has several built-in LED pins, digital I/O pins, and analog input pins. Refer to the manual of the MCU to identify these pins for proper assembly into the circuit.\n8. Assemble the circuitry of the intubation confirmation module following the electrical scheme in Figure 9B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.488#cpz1488-fig-0009].\nConsult an electrician if you do not understand the scheme.

    "Ketamine/xylazine cocktail is prepared as described above. The cocktail stays stable at room temperature for 7 days and may be stored in the refrigerator for up to 30 days. For intubations, we use a ketamine/xylazine cocktail that only contains half the amount of xylazine compared to the dosage used for surgery. This will avoid a severe drop in cardiac and respiratory function. We use the following dosage of the ketamine/xylazinexyyxylazine cocktail: 0.1 mg/g body weight/0.01 mg/g body weight. On top of the calculated amount, an additional 100 µl or 50 µl of the cocktail is injected for male or female mice, respectively. The paw reflex will not be gone completely, but as the procedure is not painful, this is not an issue. Apply gel on the eyes of the animal as necessary, to protect against drying.\n3.
