    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nRaising Flies in Axenic Condition\nTiming: ∼15 days\nThis procedure aims to grow flies devoid of gut microbiota.\nTransfer 20 mature adult females F0 (5–7 days old) into a new vial containing fly food supplemented with antibiotics.\nLet the females lay eggs for approximatively 4 h at 25°C, then remove the flies from the vial. This relatively short time window avoids too many eggs being deposited. We obtain approximatively 100–150 eggs/tube using this procedure.\nCritical: It is important to avoid overcrowded larval development, which could otherwise negatively impact larval growth and, as a consequence adult’s fitness.\nIncubate the vial for ∼10 days in a 25°C incubator.\nCollect F1 flies during 24 h after the first adult’s emergence from pupal case.\nPool and transfer F1 flies into a new vial containing food supplemented with antibiotics.\nIncubate flies for ∼5–7 days at 25°C in a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle controlled incubator.\nEvery 2 days, flip the F1 adults in a new vial supplemented with antibiotics and with few beads of deactivated baking yeast.\nCritical: Flipping avoids losing adults that may stick (and die) to the larvae-softened fly food.\nCheck Axenic Status (Optional)\nTiming: ∼1 day\nThis procedure intends to verify that F1 flies are devoid of gut microbiota. This is optional since the antibiotic treatment used in the previous section is very efficient in eliminating extracellular bacteria.\nIn a sterile environment, prepare the homogenizer 1.5 mL microtubes by adding an equivalent volume of 100 μL of 0.75/1 mm glass beads and 800 μL of sterile Luria-Bertani culture medium.\nSurface-sterilize F1 adult flies by sinking them in 70% EtOH for 20 s.\nRinse flies with sterile water.\nTransfer single individuals to a homogenizer tube.",
    "Homogenize the adults using the following cycles on the Precellys tissue homogenizer: 2 cycles of 4,000 rpm for 25 s with a 20 s pause between each cycle.\nPlate 100 μL of each lysate onto LB agar plates.\nIncubate the plates at 30°C for 48 h.\nAs a positive control, we suggest to plate lysate obtained from conventionally reared flies (see below).\nNote: We recommend to test adults individually for presence of microbiota. This allows more accurate assessment of the efficacy of the antibiotic treatment.\nNote: Most Drosophila gut bacteria will grow on LB agar during the incubation time.\nRaising Flies in Normal Condition\nTiming: ∼15 days\nRepeat steps 1–7 from section “Raising flies in axenic conditions” using vials containing fly food media without antibiotics.\nNote: This procedure explains how to grow control flies (conventionally reared)\nStarving Adult Flies\nTiming: ∼1 day\nThis procedure plans to starve adult flies before using them for the behavioral assay. Be aware that starvation dramatically changes feeding behavior making bitter substance more acceptable, for instance. We thus recommend to systematically use non-starved flies as a reference.\nTransfer 10 F1 axenic females (5–7 days old) in an empty fly culture vial.\nClose the vial with an ultra-dense plugs (25 mm width × 28 mm height).\nWith the use of a syringe and a 20G 11/2 0.9 × 40 sterile needle, pierce the plug to add 500 μl of pure water inside the vial. Rapidly flip the tube upside down to allow humidification of the plug, which avoids drowning the flies.\nNote: Move slightly the plug to the side to allow airflow and ease humidification, if necessary.\nIncubate the vial for ∼16 h in a 25°C incubator.",
    "Anesthetize the flies by directly sinking the plastic vial in ice. If necessary, gently tap the vial to drop flies to the bottom. Leave flies on ice for no more than 3 min.\nDrop the flies directly into one apparatus arena.\nNote: In one tube, starve the exact number of flies that will be deposit in one arena of the behavior apparatus. This will ease the handling of flies.\nPreparation of Axenic and Bacteria Feeding Solution\nTiming: ∼1 day\nThis procedure aims to prepare the feeding solutions used in the behavioral assay, either axenic, or contaminated by alive or heat-inactivated Ecc-152141 bacteria.\nUse a Bunsen burner to create a sterile environment in the working area.\nPour 50 mL of Luria-Bertani media pre-warm to room temperature (19°C–25°C) in a 125 mL Erlenmeyer flask.\nFlame sterilize a Pasteur pipette with a narrow tip.\nLet the pipette cool down, then collect Ecc-152141 colonies by gently passing the pipette tip onto an Ecc-152141 streak.\nDip the contaminated pipette Pasteur tip into the Luria-Bertani media and gently agitate the pipette. This helps releasing colonies from the tip.\nCover the Erlenmeyer with a sterile aluminum foil.\nGrow bacteria by incubating the Erlenmeyer in a 30°C shaking incubator for ∼16 h.\nPrecipitate bacterial cells by a 20 min centrifugation at 4,000 × g, room temperature (19°C–25°C).\nCritical: Do not exceed 4,000 × g during bacterial centrifugation, and do not centrifuge cells at 4°C but rather at 20°C–25°C. This will otherwise affect both the attractive and the aversive properties of Ecc-152141 for adult flies (for more explanation see Charroux et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nRemove the supernatant and wash the bacterial pellet with 20 mL of sterile 1× PBS.\nPellet the bacteria by centrifugation at 4,000 × g, room temperature (19°C–25°C) for 15 min.",
    "Eliminate the supernatant and re-suspend the pellet with 400 μl of sterile 1× PBS.\nDilute an aliquot of the bacterial pellet 400× as follow: add 50 μl from step 32 to 950 μl of 1× PBS, mix well and transfer 50 μl of this solution to 950 μl of 1× PBS.\nMeasure the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of the 400× dilution from step 33.\nNote: An optical density ranging from ∼0.875 to 1.25 is expected for the solution step 33, which corresponds to an optical density ranging from ∼350 to 500 for the solution step 32.\nNote: For the heat-inactivated bacterial solution, remove an aliquot (in general 100 μl) of the concentrated bacteria from step 32 and incubate it at 96°C for 10 min, using an Eppendorf 1.5 mL microtube placed into a dry block heater.\nPrepare a 150 mM sucrose solution in ultrapure sterile water.\nDilute bacteria either alive (from step 32) or heat-inactivated at a final OD600 of 50 into a 50 mM sucrose solution (final concentration), using the 150 mM sucrose solution and ultrapure sterile water.\nNote: For the axenic feeding solution, replace the equivalent volume of bacteria with sterile 1× PBS.\nColor the feeding solutions by adding 1:100 (volume:volume) of Eriauglaucine blue at 1.25 μg/mL.\nNote: Flame sterilization of the Pasteur pipette also seals the pipette tip.\nMonitoring Behavior during the Two-Choice Feeding Assay\nTiming: 6 h\nThis procedure explains how to deposit flies in the behavior apparatus as well as how to create a movie from image acquisition. An example of such movie is shown in Methods Videos S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1], S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2], and S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3].",
    "In each arena, dispense one drop of axenic solution and one drop of bacteria-contaminated solution at precise distance (see legend Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] for more details) from each side of the arena. Use the following volumes for each drop of feeding solution: 35 μl or 60 μl, when using respectively the 12 or 6 arenas apparatus, respectively.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods Video S1. Monitoring Behavior during the Two-Choice Feeding Assay\nAdult Canton-S flies are first attracted but then repulsed by an Ecc-152141-contaminated solution. Video recording of an experiment with 12 arenas, each containing around 10–11 females and two drops of feeding solution (in blue). Each arena contains one drop of a mixture of alive Ecc-152141 + 50 mM sucrose (left) and one drop of 50 mM sucrose (right). The 6 arenas on the left contain wild-type starved Canton-S flies and the 6 arenas on the right contain non-starved Canton-S flies. The recording was performed for a total duration of 6 h. Methods Video S1 corresponds to the first ∼90 min of the complete recording (Refer to steps 38–45 in Monitoring behavior during the two-choice feeding assay).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods Video S2.

This Picture Shows a 12 Arenas Apparatus with Two Drops of 35 μL of Feeding Solutions (Colored with Eriauglaucine Blue) Freshly Dispensed at Precise Location within Each Arena: 8 mm from One Side and 21 mm from the Other\nFill all the arenas with cold anesthetized F1 flies. Make sure to deposit flies away from the feeding solutions.

Analysis of the Behavior of Starved and Non-starved Canton-S Flies Showing that Non-starved Flies Displayed Reduced Attraction and Aversion to Ecc-152141\n(A) The drawing illustrates the two distances (d1 and d2) measured at every time frame of the video.\n(B) (Left graphs) Kinetic of the Attraction Index (AI) for sucrose when starved flies or non-starved flies were given the choice between an Ecc-152141contaminated sucrose solution versus sucrose only. (Right graphs) Cumulative AI (CAI) area for each specified solution (arrows) and its distribution over time.\n(C) Histograms built with the CAI values from (B).",
    "Error bars correspond to standard deviation. The preference indexes for Ecc-152141are calculated with the CAI values from (B). For (B) left graphs, the black lines and the gray lines correspond respectively to the mean and the standard deviation, and for (B) right graphs, sole the mean value of the CAI obtained with the six replicates is shown in black. (A–C), show graphical data obtained from the analysis of the full video (not shown). The time period corresponding to the three short videos (Methods Videos S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1], S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2], and S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]) shown below are indicated with red dotted lines.\nNote: The AI for each time frame is calculated as follow. The distance of each of the 10 females from the droplet 1 (d1) and for the droplet 2 (d2) is measured every 5 s and the AI is calculated as the log2 ratio of the average of distances d1 divided by the average of distances d2. The d2 attraction will be translated into a positive index and the d1 by a negative one. We then calculate a CAI corresponding to the area between the AI curve and the abscissa axis for x = 0, which represents the absolute preference of the flies for each of the two feeding solutions. We then could calculate the preference index (PI) for the solution 1 as follow, PI (solution 1) = (CAI solution 1) − (CAI solution 2)/(CAI solution 1) + (CAI solution 2).\nImport the series of images into ImageJ as an “image sequence.”\nSave as a “AVI” selecting JPEG compression and 10 frames/s.\nAnalyze the movie using Flybox as described in Charroux et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3].\nNote: The apparatus is placed on top of a LED panel (60 cm × 60 cm, 60 watts).\nNote: We use a Logitech C920 HD pro webcam.",
    "Note: We perform all experiments in a behavioral room with constant temperature (24°C) and humidity (65%).\nNote: We stop recording when one of the two droplets has disappeared (around 6–8 h) consumed by the flies, thus eliminating a two-choice situation.\nNote: We use the webcam software Yawcam to save images."
