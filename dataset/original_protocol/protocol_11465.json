    "All methods described here have been approved by the Ethics Committee II of the Medical Faculty Mannheim of the Heidelberg University. Written informed consent was obtained from all individuals.\n1. Preparation of Materials\nAnticoagulant stock solution: Prepare an anticoagulant stock solution of 200 I.U. heparin per mL in 0.9% sodium chloride. Fill each of the collection tubes (draw volume 9 mL) with 2 mL of the anticoagulant stock solution before withdrawal of the blood or bone marrow samples.\nLysis solution for red cells: Prepare the 10x lysis solution for red cells with 82.91 g ammonium chloride, 7.91 g ammonium bicarbonate, and 2 mL of 0.5 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution to a pH of 8.0 by dissolving the agents in double-distilled water for a total volume of 1 L.\nFixation solution: Add 8.3 µL of a 1 M potassium hydroxide solution to 360 mg paraformaldehyde (PFA) in a microtiter tube. Fill the tube with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to the 1 mL mark of the tube and heat the tube in a heating block at 95 °C to get 1 mL of a 36% PFA solution. Transfer the 1 mL 36% PFA solution to a tube with a capacity of 15 mL. Add 8 mL PBS to the 1 mL 36% PFA solution, to get 9 mL of a 4% PFA stock solution. Aliquot the 4% PFA stock solution and store at -18 °C until use for fixation of the cells.\n\tCAUTION: 1) Potassium hydroxide solution is corrosive. Be aware of eye and skin protection. 2) PFA is carcinogenic. Avoid skin contact and inhalation. Prepare the fixation solution under a hood.\nPermeabilization solution: Add 50 µL Octoxinol 9 to 50 mL PBS to get a solution of approximately 0.1% Octoxinol 9.",
    "Blocking solution: Prepare 5% and 2% blocking solutions by mixing the protein blocking agent with PBS and store at 6 – 8 °C.\n2. Preparation of the Samples\nFibroblasts in cell culture: Cultivate human fibroblasts of the cell line NHDF in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mM glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.\n\t\nPreparation of a microscope slide with adherent fibroblasts\n\t\t\nRemove the medium from the flask (75 cm2 growth area) with exponentially growing NHDF fibroblasts. Add 10 mL PBS to the flask. Wash the adherent fibroblasts gently by manually shaking the flask for 1 min.\nRemove the PBS and add 1 mL trypsin into the flask. Shake the flask gently to ensure that all adherent cells are covered by trypsin. Remove the trypsin from the flask. Put the flask into the incubator for 5 min at 37 °C.\nTake the flask out of the incubator and add 10 mL RPMI 1640 medium into the flask. Pipette the medium up and down several times to disperse the fibroblasts.\nPipette 0.3 mL of the dispersed fibroblasts onto each of the two fields of the microscope slide and put the slide into the incubator for 24 h so that the fibroblasts adhere to the slide. For immunostaining of γH2AX and 53BP1 in nuclei of fibroblasts, move on to step 3.1.\nPatient samples\nBlood samples: Use the collection tubes that were filled with 2 mL of the anticoagulant stock solution and add 7 mL blood into the tubes. Store the samples overnight at room temperature (i.e., 18 - 20 °C). The next day, isolate the G0/G1 phase resting mononuclear cells by density gradient centrifugation (step 2.2.3).",
    "Bone marrow samples: Use the collection tubes that were filled with 2 mL of the anticoagulant stock solution (step 1.1) and add 7 mL bone marrow into the tubes. Store the samples overnight at room temperature (i.e.,18 - 20 °C). The next day, isolate the G0/G1 phase resting mononuclear cells by density gradient centrifugation (step 2.2.3). Use CD34 microbeads and cell separation columns for the isolation of the CD34+ cells.\nIsolation of mononuclear cells by density gradient centrifugation\n\t\tNOTE: Mononuclear cells are isolated from blood and bone marrow samples by density gradient centrifugation17,18,19.\n\t\t\nDilute the heparinized blood sample in a ratio of 1:1 with PBS and the heparinized bone marrow sample in a ratio of 1:3 with PBS. Suspend the cells gently by drawing them in and out of the pipette two times.\nAdd a volume of density gradient medium to a fresh tube. Gently layer the diluted blood or bone marrow on top of the density gradient medium. Take care not to mix the two layers.\nCentrifuge the tube for 30 min at room temperature and 400 x g. Draw the upper plasma layer off with the pipette. Then carefully harvest the mononuclear cells in the layer above the density gradient medium. Transfer the mononuclear cells into a fresh tube.\nAdd at least three volumes of PBS to the mononuclear cells in the tube. Suspend the cells gently by drawing them in and out of the pipette two times. Centrifuge the tube for 10 min at room temperature and 400 x g.",
    "After the spin remove the supernatant and add 10 mL of 4 °C, 1x lysis solution for red cells. Resuspend the cells gently by drawing them in and out of the pipette two times, and place the tube on ice for 5 min. Then add 30 mL PBS at 4 °C and centrifuge the tube for 10 min at room temperature and 400 x g.\nPreparation of the cytospins\nPrepare two cytospins with mononuclear cells of the patient samples (i.e., one cytospin for γH2AX immunofluorescence staining and one cytospin for γH2AX and 53BP1 combined immunofluorescence staining) by centrifugation (300 x g, 10 min) of 1.0 x 105 cells for each preparation (Figure 3 and 4).\n3. γH2AX and 53BP1 Immunofluorescence Staining\nFixation and permeabilization: Fix the cells with 200 µL of 4% PFA for 10 min. After fixation, wash the cells gently three times with 30 mL of PBS for 5 min each on a lab shaker. Then permeabilize the cells with 200 µL of 0.1% Octoxinol 9 for 10 min. Wash the cells gently three times with 30 mL of 5% blocking solution for 5 min each on a lab shaker. Block the cells in 30 mL of fresh 5% blocking solution for 1 h.\nIncubation with antibodies\nIncubate one preparation of the cells with a mouse monoclonal anti-γH2AX antibody (1:500) and the other preparation of the cells with a mouse monoclonal anti-γH2AX antibody (1:500) and a polyclonal rabbit anti-53BP1 antibody (1:500) overnight at 4 °C.\nAfter incubation wash the cells gently 3 times with 30 mL of 2% blocking solution for each 5 min on a lab shaker.",
    "Remove the blocking solution and incubate the first preparation of the cells with an Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:500) and the second preparation of the cells with an Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:500) and an Alexa555-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:500) for 1 h at room temperature.\nMounting medium: Put the slide with the cells in a bowl and wash the cells gently three times with 30 mL of PBS for each 5 min on a lab shaker. Remove the PBS and mount the cells with mounting medium containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Cautiously put a coverslip on top of the mounting medium so that no air bubbles are embedded. Wait at least 3 h for hardening of the mounting medium before analyzing the cells by fluorescence microscopy.\n4. Analysis of γH2AX and 53BP1 Foci\nFluorescence microscopy: Analyse the γH2AX and 53BP1 foci in the cell nuclei with a fluorescence microscope equipped with filters for DAPI, Alexa 488, and Cy3 during imaging at a 100X objective magnification. Record images with a camera and process the images with appropriate imaging software.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
