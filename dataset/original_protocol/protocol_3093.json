    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSample collection\nTiming: 10–30 min\nThis step describes how to take and transport samples.\nSelect tissue from the area of interest, trim as much of the discarded tissue as possible with a sterile scalpel and cut the tissue to a size of about 6 mm (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], avoid locations containing blood clots or erosive areas).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2867-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Tissue areas containing blood clots or eroded areas that need to be discarded\nWash the tissue twice with pre-cooled PBS or cell suspension solution, then place the tissue in tissue storage solution and transport on ice for further experiments within 30 min.\nProcessing of tissue\nTiming:  < 30 min\nThis step describes how to pre-treat the sample before enzymatic digestion.\nRemove tissue from tissue preservation solution and place on ice in a 35 mm Petri dish, then rinse tissue 2–3 times using ice-cold PBS or cell suspension solution to remove any remaining blood.\nTrim tissue blocks in PBS with sterilized scissors, selecting structurally intact tissue with a weight of about 0.2 g and avoiding blood clots.\nAspirate the PBS and unwanted tissue and gently cut the tissue with scissors into 1 mm3 dimension (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2867-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Mincing of hepatoblastoma tissue in digestion medium\nCritical: All instruments and consumables should be sterile and instruments such as scissors should be moistened with PBS or culture medium before use to avoid contact between tissue and dry items which may reduce viability.\nNote: If necessary, the clipped tissue can be gently rinsed with PBS and the supernatant carefully aspirated and discarded. This can further remove excess blood from the tissue.\nEnzymatic digestion and mechanical dissociation of tissue\nTiming: 60 min",
    "This step details how enzymatic digestion in combination with gentle mechanical force allows for dissociation of solid liver tissue into single cell suspension.\nAspirate 5 mL of cell lysis solution using a serological pipette.\nAdd to the previous Petri dish containing the tissue.\nTransfer the tissue with the cell lysis solution into a 50 mL centrifuge tube using a serological pipette.\nPut the 50 mL centrifuge tube to a 37°C water bath shaker, digest the tissue for 8 min, with the shaker speed set at 80–100 rpm.\nWhen the first enzymatic digestion is complete, pipette the tissue and liquid up and down for about 10 times using a 5 mL Pasteur pipette, so that the tissue and the enzyme solution can be fully mixed to further disrupt the tissue.\nAfter the settlement of the remaining tissue, collect the suspension and discharge onto a 70 μm cell strainer placed on top of a 50 mL centrifuge tube on ice to terminate the enzymatic reaction and collect the cells.\nRinse the cell strainer with about 200 μL cell suspension solution and pass it through the cell strainer, to retrieve the maximal number of cells, absorb the cell suspension as much as possible for filtration.\nAdd 5 mL of fresh cell lysis solution into the remaining tissue fragments in the 50 mL centrifuge tube for a second round of tissue dissociation. Incubate in a 37°C water bath for 10 min.\nNote: Shake the centrifuge tube every 2 min for 5–10 s\nWhen the second enzymatic digestion is complete, transfer the suspension to the 50 mL centrifuge tube from which the supernatant was previously collected and stored.",
    "Optional: Repeat the enzymatic digestion of the tissue precipitate in step 2 and collect the supernatant. Depending on the digestion of the tissue mass, we recommend that the total number of digestions is not more than 4. Please also note that a reduction of the tissue mass is usually observed after digestion.\nNote: Cell counts and viability counts can be performed on the supernatant obtained from each enzymatic digestion to determine the dissociations times. For example, obtaining less than one million cells per enzymatic digestion, or a cell viability of less than 70%, can be the end point of enzymatic digestion.\nAll the collected supernatant was filtered through a 70 μm filter and the filtrate was collected using a 50 mL centrifuge tube.\nCollect the cells by centrifugation at 300 g for 6 min at 4°C\nResuspend the cell precipitate using cell suspension solution and transfer it to a 15 mL centrifuge tube. Repeat the previous centrifugation step and resuspend the precipitate with an appropriate amount of ice-cold cell suspension solution or PBS (∼2–3 mL).\nDensity gradient centrifugation via multiple-layered Percoll\nTiming:  < 60 min\nThis step details how the different components of the single cell suspension were separated by centrifugation using the Percoll density gradient protocol, which yielded a hepatocyte layer with the main component of hepatocytes and the immunocyte precipitation layer with the main component of immune cells and red blood cells. This method is used to remove the fragments from the single cell suspension and isolate the hepatocytes, so as to prevent the influence of the subsequent red cell lysis step on the activity of hepatocytes.\nAdd 3 mL of the 30% Percoll solution to the bottom of a 15 mL centrifuge tube.",
    "Using a Pasteur pipette, reach to the bottom of the tube and slowly add 3 mL of the 50% Percoll solution to the lower layer of the 30% Percoll solution.\nSlowly add 3 mL of the cell suspension onto the surface of the 30% Percoll layer, taking care not to disturb the gradient.\nOptional: It is also appropriate to add the 50% Percoll solution to the centrifuge tube first and then add the 30% Percoll solution along the liquid surface using a Pasteur pipette. Finally, add the cell suspension to the surface of the gradient.\nNote: Each layer needs to be added very gently to avoid disturbing the gradient.\nCentrifugation at 400 g for 20 min at 4°C, set acceleration 4 and no brake (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2867-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Density gradient centrifugation via multiple-layered Percoll\nAspirate and discard the top layer of PBS, the layer of cellular debris between the PBS and 30% Percoll layer (there may be no cellular debris layer or it may not be visible) and the 30% Percoll layer in turn.\nCarefully transfer the hepatocyte layer between the 30% Percoll layer and 50% Percoll layer to a 15 mL centrifuge tube, keeping the total volume to a maximum of 2 mL.\nNote: Transfer as little liquid as possible from the Percoll layer when transferring the hepatocyte layer.\nRed blood cell lysis and cell washing\nTiming: 30 min\nThis step washes the different layers of cells to remove participating Percoll medium and impurities and performs erythrocyte lysis on the immune cell layer.\nDilution of the cell suspension of the hepatocyte layer with 3 times volume of cell suspension solution and centrifugation at 300 g for 10 min at 4°C.",
    "Note: Add at least 3 times the volume of hepatocyte layer liquid and mix gently and well to prevent loss of cells after centrifugation due to unmixed Percoll.\nThe precipitate below 50% Percoll layer contains immune cells and erythrocytes. Aspirate and discard all supernatants (remaining 50% Percoll layer), then resuspend the immune cell precipitate using 1 mL of ACK Lysing buffer and let it react for 3 min at room temperature to lyse the erythrocytes.\nTo terminate the erythrocyte lysis reaction, the erythrocyte lysed immune cell fluid was filled with 10 mL cell suspension solution in 15 mL centrifuge tubes and the immune cells were collected by centrifugation at 500 g for 10 min at 4°C (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2867-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Cell pellets before, during and after red blood cell lysis\nResuspend the cell precipitates from steps 20 and 22 respectively with 2 mL cell suspension solution or 0.04% BSA solution and perform quality control on the cell suspensions (this can be adjusted after an initial count if necessary to get optimal cell concentrations for counting).\nCell viability, concentration and singularity evaluation and counting\nTiming:  < 20 min\nIn this step, the activity of the immune cell resuspension and hepatocyte layer suspension was examined and recorded under the microscope. Subsequently, the two cell suspensions were combined and quantified.\nAspirate 10 μL of Percoll density gradient centrifuged hepatocyte layer suspension and immune cell resuspension after erythrocyte lysis respectively from step 23 and stain with 10 μL of Trypan blue stain (0.4%), then examine the cell status using ECLIPSE Ti2 inverted microscope. The results are shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2867-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Results of Taipan Blue staining of different cell layers after multiple- layered Percoll density gradient separation",
    "(A and B) (A) shows the hepatocyte layer with a larger overall cell diameter, and (B) shows the immune cell layer with a smaller overall cell diameter.\nMix the above two single cell suspensions (hepatocyte suspension and immune cell suspension), centrifuge them at 400 g for 10 min at 4°C, and then resuspend in 5 mL cell suspension solution or 0.04% BSA solution. Afterward, proceed to the next step of detecting the viability and concentration of the single cell suspensions.\nNote: The volume of cell suspension solution required for resuspension is determined by the requirements of subsequent experiments. We believe that a final concentration of 1000–3000 cells/μL is favorable for counting, while for 10× Genomics Single-cell transcriptome library construction, a final concentration of 800–1300 cells/μL is favorable for obtaining stable results.\nTo determine cell viability and concentration, 10 μL of the final single-cell suspension from step 25 was stained with 10 μL of Cellometer ViaStainTM AOPI Staining Solution (AOPI) and analyzed using the Countstar Altair Smart Cell Analyzer. The results of the automated counts are shown in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2867-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Results of AOPI staining of single cell suspensions\n(A) illustrates the composition of a single cell suspension.\n(B) presents the live cell count within the same field of view.\n(C) depicts the dead cell count in the identical area. The total cell concentration reached 1.13 × 10ˆ6/mL, with a live cell concentration of 1.09 × 10ˆ6/mL (96.5%) and a dead cell concentration of 3.97 × 10ˆ4/mL (3.5%).\nNote: Survival rate should be at least 80%. A high percentage of dead cells indicates a problem with the processing of the tissue, e.g., due to problems with enzyme concentration, incubation time and other processing steps.\nIf cell viability lower than 80%, refer to troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].",
    "If the cell count is below 500 cells/mL, please refer to troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nIf cell viability is ≥ 80% and cell count is ≥ 500 cells/mL, proceed to the next step.\nNote: When using an automated cell counter, it is important to ensure that the correct focus is set to count all surviving cells of different sizes and shapes. Examining cell morphology under a bright-field microscope is a good way to make a quick visual inspection of the results of the automated cell counter.\nSingle-cell transcriptome library construction\nTiming: 1 day\nA brief procedure for the construction of single cell transcriptome library from the cell suspensions obtained by step 25 via Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ Kit v3.1 (10× Genomics).
