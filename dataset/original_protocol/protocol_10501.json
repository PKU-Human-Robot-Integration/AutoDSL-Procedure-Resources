    "1. Planning of Experiments\nDetermine the volume of copper nanocomposites needed for synthesis. On that basis, choose a number of small volume flasks (25 cm2), or larger flasks as indicated below in preparation of materials.\nFor this synthesis, use a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 and at least 40% humidity. Ensure that such an incubator is available and that it will not be repeatedly disturbed over the period of synthesis (approximately 24 hr).\n\tCAUTION: Repeated opening and closing of the incubator will certainly cause temperature fluctuations which may result in altered synthesis of the nanocomposite structures.\n2. Preparation of Materials\nPrepare all materials fresh before the start of an experiment, by adding solid materials to solvents right before synthesis is to begin. Keeping stock solutions of cystine and copper starting materials in liquid for long times before the experiment is not recommended and may lead to variable results. Once opened from the vendor, keep starting materials dry by wrapping the top of the container with Parafilm.\n\tNote: The following protocol is used as an example for reaction in a 25 cm2 cell culture flask using 7 µl of cystine, 6,643 µl of sterile water, and 350 µl of CNPs.\nPrepare a 2 mg/ml solution of copper nanoparticles by weighing out at least 2 mg of CNPs. Wear disposable gloves during this step to prevent possible contact of CNPs with skin. Place the nanoparticles in an empty sterile 16 ml glass vial.",
    "To the vial containing CNPs, add sterile deionized water in the appropriate volume to make a 2 mg/ml solution and vortex the solution for 20 sec to provide dispersion of the nanoparticles before synthesis starts (at least 1 ml total volume is recommended). Do not fill the vial more than half way with water as this will inhibit mixing by vortexing. CNPs will quickly settle to the bottom of the vial and will appear dark in color (grey to black).\nSonicate the CNP solution for 17 min at RT to provide maximal dispersion of CNPs before start of synthesis. Periodically check to make sure that CNPs are mixing due to sonication. After a successful sonication, CNPs remain suspended in solution for at least 30 min and the solution will be dark in color.\nWeigh out sufficient mass of cystine to make a 72.9 mg/ml solution for the synthesis. Since cystine is not directly soluble in water, place the weighed cystine in an antistatic weighing vessel.\n\t\nTo the weighing vessel containing cystine, add sufficient volume of sterile, 1 M NaOH, so that the cystine completely dissolves. For example, dissolve 7.29 mg of cystine completely in 100 µl of 1 M NaOH, to make a 72.9 mg/ml solution.\nTo maintain sterile conditions, carry out this step in a sterile flow tissue culture hood.\n\t\tCAUTION: NaOH at 1 M concentration is caustic, so wear disposable gloves during this step to prevent contact of concentrated NaOH with skin",
    "Working in a sterile tissue culture hood, add 7 µl of cystine with 6,643 µl of sterile water to the sterile synthesis flask first, and let incubate for 30 min in the incubator at 37 °C with the flask cap vented (loose) to provide effective mixing. Resuspend the 2 mg/ml CNP solution by vortexing for 30 sec, since CNPs will have settled after the sonication step.\n\t\nAdd sufficient CNP solution to the synthesis flask (using sterile technique) to maintain the following component ratios: combine 1 parts cystine, 50 parts CNPs, and 949 parts sterile water in a 25 cm2 cell culture flask to start the synthesis. For example, for a 7 ml synthesis volume, combine 7 µl of cystine stock solution, 350 µl of CNPs, and 6,643 µl of sterile water. Replace the cap on the flask and tighten so that it is secure.\nAfter combining all components for the synthesis, gently mix in the flask by swirling 4-5 times. Place flask in the CO2 incubator and vent the flask by loosening the cap so that there will be gas exchange in and out of the flask during synthesis.\nAllow synthesis to run in the incubator for approximately 24 hr. During synthesis, one can observe, with microscopy and by eye, formation of highly linear composites.\n\tNote: The process of formation of the structures may happen suddenly in the sense that structures are initially hard to detect, then appearance proceeds quickly to an increasing density. Formation may therefore occur before 24 hr. The process can also be observed by eye once structures become larger and their density increases. While generation of the structures can be observed over time under the microscope and by eye at later time points, continuously interrupting the synthesis conditions and temperature will lead to poor synthesis results.",
    "Terminate synthesis of biocomposites by tightly capping the synthesis flask and storing the vessel in a refrigerator (4 °C). Structures, once generated, remain stable in this form for at least a year. Label the flask with synthesis conditions, including components utilized, date of the synthesis, and incubation time of the synthesis before termination.\n3. Synthesis Using Copper Sulfate\nCarry out self-assembly synthesis by replacing CNPs with copper sulfate salt. Using sterile technique, dissolve at least 2 mg of copper sulfate in sufficient volume of sterile deionized water to make a 2 mg/ml solution. The copper sulfate crystals easily go into solution at this concentration, but vortex the vial if needed, and inspect by eye to ensure all crystals are dissolved.\nAfter preparation of the copper sulfate, carry out synthesis as described previously, but replacing CNPs with the copper sulfate.\n\tNote: Self-assembled nanocomposites using copper sulfate as a starting material were found to be much more consistent in final shape than for structures synthesized from CNPs.\nTerminate the synthesis of copper sulfate biocomposites as for CNP composites (step 2.6) and store them long-term at 4 °C.\n4. Characterization and Handling of Biocomposites Post-synthesis\nCharacterize biocomposites derived from CNPs and from copper sulfate by white light microscopy9 and by electron microscopy9.\n\t\nFor characterization and inspection of biocomposites post-synthesis by white light microscopy, use an inverted microscope as composites will settle to the bottom surface of the flask within a few minutes of laying the flask flat, and can then be brought into focus. Use the bright field setting on the microscope to maximize contrast between biocomposites and the liquid medium. Composites derived from CNPs and copper sulfate will both appear clear to opaque in color, but unreacted CNP aggregates will appear very dark in color.",
    "Use a digital camera connected to the microscope to capture images of the composites. A range of lengths for the individual structures will be observed.\nFor characterization and inspection of biocomposites post-synthesis and after storage at 4 °C, allow flasks to come to RT for at least 15 min as flasks will form condensation initially upon removal from refrigerator, which will obscure effective focusing while carrying out microscopy imaging. After allowing equilibration to RT, wipe the top and bottom surfaces of the flask with a clean paper towel to maximize microscopy imaging quality.\nWhen working with or imaging composites that have been stored long-term, vortex the flask for 30 sec to dissociate clumps of composites that form while in the refrigerator. After vortexing, inspect the structures with an inverted microscope to ensure that aggregates have dissociated, and repeat vortexing as necessary.\nUse inverted white light microscopy to assess the efficacy of the synthesis for a given experiment using CNPs. For example, document the presence or absence of unreacted CNPs in synthesis flasks used for CNP-derived biocomposites from flasks with different parameters such as time of synthesis.\n\t\tNote: Individual CNPs are too small to observe with a light microscope, but unreacted CNP aggregates will appear as round-shape and dark objects, in contrast to the successfully synthesized CNP-composites which will have a high-aspect ratio, linear form, and will have a range of different lengths. Avoid carrying out synthesis for too long of a period of time before termination, as this will result in highly branched “urchin” type structures, which are difficult to disperse into individual structures once formed.",
    "Use inverted white light microscopy to assess the efficacy of the synthesis for a given experiment using copper sulfate. Since copper sulfate goes fully into solution using this protocol, the solution will appear less dark than the solution from synthesis using CNPs. Document the size and extent of copper sulfate composites by comparing flasks with different synthesis conditions such as time of synthesis before termination.\n\t\tNote: Successfully synthesized composites will show a range of different lengths. Avoid carrying out synthesis for too long of a period of time before termination, as this will result in highly branched aggregates of composites, some of which will be “urchin-like” in structure, and which are difficult to disperse into individual structures once formed.\nTo concentrate biocomposites post-synthesis, centrifuge solutions of composites in a centrifuge tube. Add 6 ml of either CNP-derived structures or copper sulfate-derived structures to a 15 ml centrifuge tube. Centrifuge for 10 min at 500 x g at RT to form a pellet. For smaller volumes, add 500 µl of structures in solution to 0.6 ml sized tubes. Centrifuge at 2,000 x g at RT for at least 10 min to form a pellet.\n\t\nAfter centrifuging for sufficient time (at least 10 min for microfuges), save the observable pellet at the bottom of the tube where the structures are concentrated by carefully removing the supernatant liquid above the pellet. Biocomposite structures derived from copper sulfate appear blue in color and structures derived from CNPs are darker (grey to black).\nAdd more composites to this tube and repeat the process in the same tube to concentrate structures if desired. To disperse the concentrated pellets, add the desired volume of solution to the tube, and vortex for 10-30 sec.",
    "Sonicate structures once formed, to move the average population size (lengths) of the structures to lower values. Place structures in sterile deionized water and sonicate for at least 10 min. Using this process, over time, structures become fragmented and smaller in average length (see Figure 6 of the text). Document changes in composite sizes with different sonication times using an inverted white light microscope and digital camera.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
