    "Human PKR gene cloning   RNA isolation and cDNA library generation   Grow the cells in a 35 mm dish with 10 ml DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 until 80% confluence.   Remove the media from the culture dish.   Add 1 ml TRIzol reagent directly to the cells in the culture dish.   Pipette the cells up and down for 5 times in the culture dish to lyse the cells.   Incubate the sample at room temperature for 5 min to allow for complete nuclear lysis.   Add 0.2 ml of chloroform and share the tube vigorously by hand for 15 sec.   Incubate for 2 min at room temperature.   Centrifuge the sample at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.   Remove the aqueous supernatant by angling the tube at 45° to avoid contacting the interphase or the organic layer.   Transfer the aqueous phase into a new tube and add 0.5 ml of 100% isopropanol.   Incubate at room temperature for 10 min.   Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.  Note: RNA should be visible as a white pellet.   Remove the supernatant carefully from the tube without touching the RNA pellet.   Wash the pellet with 1 ml of 75% ethanol pre-chilled at 4 °C.   Vortex the sample briefly, followed by centrifugation at 7,600 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.   Remove the ethanol carefully and air dry the RNA pellet for 15 min on ice.   Re-suspend the RNA pellet in 100 μl DEPC-treated water and incubate at 37 °C for 10 min.   Measure the RNA concentration using a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer, NanoDrop spectrophotometer or Bioanalyzer.

Add 1x LDS loading buffer with 5% β-mercaptoethanol to stop the reaction.   Perform Western blotting to determine the PKR activation by probing for level p-PKR against total PKR.   Electrophorese the samples through a NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris protein gel.   Transfer the resolved proteins onto an immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane at 100 V for 90 min at 4 °C.
