Ship the blood samples at 20°C–25°C on the same-day or for 12–18 h courier to the processing lab.\nNote: We were successful using blood draws made five days after a booster vaccination when memory B-cells are likely to be in peripheral circulation.\nNote: Simultaneously blood without anticoagulants need to be collected to confirm the reactivity of serum against vaccine immunogen.\nDilute blood with 20°C–25°C DPBS-2 mM EDTA (1:1 v/v).\nAdd 20 mL Ficoll-Paque to an empty 50 mL conical centrifuge tube.\nCarefully layer 30 mL of diluted blood onto Ficoll-Paque.\nNote: Do not mix the blood and Ficoll- Paque media.\nNote: Seven 50 mL conical centrifuge tube containing Ficoll-Paque (GE-Healthcare) is required if collecting 100 mL blood.\nCentrifuge at 800 × g for 20 min at 20°C–25°C (brake: off; acceleration: slow).\nNote: Set the centrifuge at 4°C after this step.\nUsing a sterile pipette, carefully discard the upper layer containing plasma and platelets. Do not disturb the white mononuclear cell layer.\nNote: Diluted plasma in the upper layer can be stored and tested to determine the titre of antibodies against the target antigen. Antibodies can also be purified from diluted plasma if required.\nUse a transfer pipette in a slow, circular motion to carefully suck up mononuclear cells (the white layer like a white cloud on top of Ficoll-Paque layer). Transfer the cells into an empty sterile 50 mL conical centrifuge tube.",
    "Add at least 2 volumes of cold DPBS-2 mM EDTA (4°C–8°C) to the transferred mononuclear cells.\nResuspend the cells gently and horizontally centrifuge at 325 × g for 8 min at 4°C (brake: off; acceleration: slow).\nNote: If it is important to get rid of platelets, centrifuge the cells at low speed (100–200 × g) for 10 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the mononuclear cells in 2 mL cold DPBS-2 mM EDTA and pool the cells from 50 mL conical centrifuge tubes into one 50 mL centrifuge tube. Fill to top with cold DPBS-2 mM EDTA.\nHorizontally centrifuge at 150 × g for 8 min at 4°C (brake: off; acceleration: slow). Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in 3–4 mL 0.83% ammonium chloride and incubate for 5 min on ice.\nWash the cells with 20 mL cold DPBS-2 mM EDTA and centrifuge at 150 × g for 8 min at 4°C (brake: on; acceleration: high).\nDiscard the supernatant and repeat the wash step two more times. Resuspend the cells in cold DPBS-2 mM EDTA and count the cells.\nCentrifuge at 150 × g for 8 min at 4°C (brake: on; acceleration: high).\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in freezing media containing 90% horse serum (Sigma Aldrich) and 10% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO).\nNote: Freeze 10–20 million cells per 1 mL freezing media.\nNote: Label the microtubes before aliquoting the cells as it is not recommended to keep the cell in cryopreservation medium at 20°C–25°C. Place the cryovials in the freezing container and store them at −80°C for 24 h (for long-term storage, transfer the vials to liquid nitrogen).\nStaining and sorting of antigen-specific B cells\nTiming: ∼ 6 h (for steps 17 to 43)",
    "The protocol for staining and sorting of cells needs to be designed and tested in advance according to the user’s experimental needs. To clarify the strategy, we describe using a panel of antibodies to sort HIV-1 envelope (Env)-specific B cells in this step.\nBiotinylation of HIV-1 Env probe\nAdd 0.15 nmol of Avi-tagged HIV-1 AD8 SOSIP v4.1 Env (130 kDa; 20 μL from 1 mg/mL stock) to one sterile 1.5 mL microtube.\nNote: AD8 SOSIP is a native like stabilized cleavable version of Env.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] Avi-tag is an extra 15 amino acid sequence that can be fused to the N- or the C-terminus of protein (C-terminus in this study). BirA ligase enzymatically attaches one biotin molecule to Avi-tag.\nCritical: HIV-1 Env need to be in Bicine 50 mM buffer for efficient biotinylation. Change the buffer before this step if it is required.\nAdd 0.5 μg (1.19 μL from 0.42 mg/mL stock) of BirA enzyme from BirA Biotin-Protein Ligase Kit (Avidity) to microtube.\nNote: 2.5 μg of BirA enzyme is required per 10 n mol protein in 40 μM final volume).\nAdd 3 μL Biomix A and 3 μL Biomix B from BirA Biotin-Protein Ligase Kit (Avidity) to the microtube.\nAdjust the final reaction volume to 30 μL with ddH2O (2.81 μL).\nIncubate the reaction at 30°C for 40 min.\nChange the buffer to DPBS using 50 kDa Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter units according to the manufacturer’s instruction.\nNote: Adjust the final volume to 20–100 μL (final concentration 0.2–1 mg/mL).\nCritical: Efficient biotinylation and retained antigen activity must be confirmed according to the user’s experimental needs before fluorescent labelling. Biotinylation can be checked in ELISA assay by coating the wells with biotinylated Env then detecting the biotin with streptavidin-HRP. Antigenicity and the presence of epitopes can be tested using different antibodies.",
    "Fluorescent labelling of sorting probe\nCouple HIV-1 Env to streptavidin-APC and streptavidin-PE (Thermo Fisher Scientific) separately in equimolar ratios as following:\nNote: If double staining is not required, coupling can be limited to APC as a very bright fluorochrome with minimal spectral overlap with Alexa-488-IgG.\nAdd 5.54 μL Streptavidin-PE to sterile 1.5 mL microtube containing 6.46 μL DPBS (Gibco). Mix it well and cover the microtube with aluminium foil to protect from light. Keep the microtube on ice.\nAdd 4.10 μL Streptavidin-APC to another sterile 1.5 mL microtube containing 7.90 μL DPBS (Gibco). Mix it well and cover the microtube with aluminium foil to protect from light. Keep the microtube on ice.\nIn two separate microtube, add 8 μg (1 mg/mL) HIV-1 Env AD8 SOSIP v4.1 and label them as PE and APC, respectively.\nAdd 2.4 μL Streptavidin-PE/DPBS mixture to microtube PE, cover the microtube with aluminium foil to protect from light and incubate for 15 min on ice while shaking (or use a rotary shaker at 4°C).\nRepeat step 26, four more time (each time 2.4 μL) to add all Streptavidin-PE/DPBS mixture to HIV-1 Env probe.\nNote: Keep the microtube at 4°C until use for maximum 24 h.\nRepeat step 22 for APC microtube using Streptavidin-APC/DPBS mixture.\nStaining and fluorescence-activated cell (FACS) sorting of antigen-specific bovine B cells\nThis step can be performed by both cryopreserved or freshly isolated PBMC. If using cryopreserved PBMCs, start with step 29 and if using freshly isolated PBMCs, start with step 37.\nThaw 2–3 million cryopreserved PBMCs in 37°C water batch until there is just a small bit of ice left in the vial.\nAdd 500 μL pre-warmed 37°C RPMI 1640 medium (Life technologies) (containing 10% FBS, 20 μg/mL or 10 U/mL RQ1 RNase -free DNaseI (Promega)) dropwise. Resuspend the cells.",
    "Transfer the cells to one sterile 10 mL conical centrifuge tube and add 9.5 mL pre-warmed RPMI (as above) slowly. Incubate for 5 min at RT.\nFilter the cells through a 40-μm cell strainer to remove clumps followed by horizontal centrifugation at 200 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 6 mL cold DPBS-2 mM EDTA-1% horse serum.\nAdd 4 mL Ficoll-Paque to one sterile 10 mL conical centrifuge tube. Layer the cells onto the Ficoll-Paque and centrifuge at 500 × g for 20 min at 4°C (brake: off; acceleration: slow).\nCritical: This step removes the dead cells which improves the efficiency of staining.\nCollect the white layer on top of Ficoll-Paque and transfer to one sterile 10 mL conical centrifuge tube. Add 9 mL cold DPBS-2 mM EDTA-1% horse serum.\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 10 min at 4°C (brake: on; acceleration: high) and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in 157.9 μL cold DPBS-2 mM EDTA and transfer them to one sterile 5 mL FACS tube.\nAdd 0.1 μL LIVE/DEAD™ Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubate the cells on ice for 10–15 min.\nAdd 20 μL HIV-1 Env-PE, 20 μL HIV-1 Env-APC and 2 μL Alexa-fluor 488 conjugated anti-bovine IgG (Sigma, B6901). Incubate the cells for 1 h on ice (on a rocking mixer).\nNote: anti-bovine IgG (clone B6901) is in unconjugated format and need to be conjugated to Alexa-fluor 488 before the staining.\nAdd 4 mL DPBS containing 1 mM EDTA and 1% horse serum (Sigma) and centrifuge at 500 × g for 10 min.\nResuspend the cells in 200–500 μL DPBS-2 mM EDTA-1% horse serum and filter through a 40-μm cell strainer to remove clumps.",
