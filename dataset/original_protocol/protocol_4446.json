    "Protocol for collection and processing of male genital secretionsAfter cleaning hands and penis with sanitary wipes, semen is collected by masturbation into a Fisherbrand™ Polyethylene Hinged-Lid Container with about 2 ml of VTM (after 72 h of sexual abstinence).Following masturbation, the semen specimen should sit for at least 30 min (but no more than 4 h) at room temperature prior to processing to allow liquefaction.Record volume, time of collection and start time of processing.Transfer ejaculate (inclusive VTM) to a sterile Corning® 15 ml centrifuge tube.Centrifuge at 700 x g room-temp for 12 min in the SorvallTM RC4 floor centrifuge.If the GS specimen is very sticky/ goopy it is recomended to break up the specimen by pipetting the sample with a sterile narrow tip opening. Pipet 5-10 times gently, holding the tip very close to the bottom of the 15 ml conical tube. Repeat centrifugation step in order to separate plasma from cells.All of the plasma should be collected without disrupting the cell pellet in 0.5-1.5 ml pre-labelled aliquots (SARSTEDT 2.0 ml Micro Tubes) and stored at -80 °C.Flick to break up the cell pellet (no vortex) and re-suspend in 10 ml of Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution.Centrifuge at 700 x g room-temp for 12 min to pellet cells.Aspirate off the HBSS wash using a sterile VWR® Disposable Aspirating Pipet and Allied® 1,500 ml Disposable Collection Canister (vacuum trap) with 10% Waxie® Bleach.Flick to break up the cell pellet (no vortex) and re-suspend seminal cells in 1 ml of 20% complete RPMI medium for GS.Pipet a few times to gently homogenize the seminal cells in 1 ml of 20% GS complete RPMI medium without vortexing.Add 1 ml of 20% GS freeze medium to bring the total volume to ~2 ml and pipet a few times to mix evenly again no vortexing.",
    "Keep the cells on ice at all times.Aliquot the 2 ml cell suspension into 4 x 500 µl aliquots (yellow-cap, 2.0 ml CryoElite Sterile Cryogenic Vials) and freeze viably in Nalgene® Mr. FrostyTM Freezing Container* at -80 °C overnight.  The next day, move to -150 °C liquid nitrogen storage.Please note other cell cryopreservation methods/canisters are acceptable as long as the cells are viably frozen slowly at -1 °C per min. Collection and storage of seminal cells (steps A7-13) is optional. Stored cells can be used for future studies but will not be used for this protocol.Isolation of nucleic acids Thaw 1 ml of seminal plasma at room temperature.Immediately transfer 0.2 ml of seminal plasma into 1.5 ml SARSTEDT screw cap tube containing 20 μl of 0.5M EDTA solution to inhibit DNAase activity. Mix well by pipetting, quickly vortex, and put on ice. Repeat this step to obtain a duplicate of the same sample. Then extract DNA as described below.Note: Duplicates are only necessary to run the entire panel of seven HHV. In preparation for RNA extraction quickly transfer 0.5 ml of seminal plasma into a 1.5 ml SARSTEDT screw cap tube containing 0.5 ml 1x DPBS and pipet gently a few times to reduce viscosity. Then immediately put on ice.To concentrate RNA, centrifuge the 1 ml seminal samples with DBPS at 4 °C for 1 h at 23,500 x g using the Allegra® 64R centrifuge. Refer to RNA extraction described below. Note: Do not allow the samples to sit around after the high-speed spin; the viral pellet is unstable! For RNA extraction (high pure viral RNA kit) Following centrifugation, carefully remove the supernatant from each tube leaving 200 μl, not disturbing the invisible RNA pellet.Extract RNA following the manufacture’s protocol (high pure viral RNA kit).",
    "Note: To increase RNA yield, incubate for 10 min at room temperature after adding the binding buffer to the sample. To further increase yield, incubate High Pure Filter Tube loaded with 50 μl heated elution buffer for 5 min. Heat elution buffer at 60 °C before elution step.After elution, transfer RNA extracts to pre-labelled 1.5 ml SARSTEDT screw cap tubes and put on ice. Immediately proceed to cDNA generation discussed below. Finally store remainder of RNA extract at -80 °C.For DNA extraction (QIAamp DNA mini kit) Extract DNA following the manufacturer’s protocol (QIAamp DNA mini kit).Note: To increase DNA yield incubate the QIAamp Mini column loaded with 100 μl heated AE Buffer for 10 min. Heat AE buffer at 60 °C before elution step. Centrifuge for 1 min at max speed (16,000 x g) in a clean seal-Rite 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube (flip-top).Combine identical duplicates respectively and transfer to pre-labelled 1.5 ml SARSTEDT screw cap tube to be stored at 4 °C short-term or -20 °C long-term storage.For cDNA HIV-1 generation (InvitrogenTM SuperScript® III first-strand synthesis system) In a 0.2 ml MicroAmp® reaction tube with cap, mix 10 μl of extracted RNA (for seminal sample and HIV RNA for quantification standard) with 1 μl of 20 μM HIV-1 reverse primer (see Table 1) and 1 μl of 10mM dNTPs (primers and dNTPs can be pre-combined).Incubate at 65 °C for 5 min.Place immediately on ice for at least 1 min.To each reaction tube add (can be pre-mixed):2 μl of 10x RT buffer from kit2 μl MgCl2 (50 mM) *not included in kit 2 μl 0.",
    "1 M DTT from kit1 μl RNase OUT enzyme (40 U/ml) from kit1 μl SuperScript III RT enzyme (200 U/ml) from kitIncubate at 50 °C for 50 min and inactivate reaction at 85 °C for 5 min.Store at 4 °C short-term and -20 °C long-term storage.Quantification of cDNA and DNA viruses by RT-qPCRFor cDNA quantification RT-qPCRStandard preparation: Each HIV RNA standard aliquot (DAIDS VQA) contains 150,000 copies HIV-1 RNA/ml spiked into negative plasma. It is important to treat the quantification standard exactly the same way as the seminal plasma samples (inclusive RNA extraction, cDNA generation and quantification). The use of RNA standards takes the variable efficiencies of the different steps into account (especially the reverse transcription step). cDNA generated during reverse transcription will be used as the template for amplification in the subsequent RT-qPCR.

Add water to adjust the volume to 50 μl total volume per reaction per well. Each sample should be run in duplicate (or in triplicates) and final result will be obtained as an average value of the replicate wells.PCR cycling conditions:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150429/20150429230139_5996.pngFor DNA Quantification RT-qPCRStandard preparation: Quantification standards for the different herpes viruses were obtained using plasmid preparations with known concentrations. Because plasmid sequences are highly abundant (for example 1 x 1010 - 1 x 1012 per μl), they can be sources of PCR contamination. Extreme caution must be exercised when working with these DNAs to prevent their exposure to stock PCR reagents, solvents used for the dilution of PCR reagents and laboratory equipment and surfaces. Prepare little aliquots (for example 2 μl) to avoid multiple thawing. Example of serial dilution (using 10 mM Tris) starting from a plasmid concentration (stock=D0) of 2 x 1010 per μl. Accurate pipetting is essential because the standards must be diluted over several orders of magnitude. table:\n﻿0,1,2\nDilution,Dilution factor,Copies per µl\nD0,Undiluted stock,2 x 1010\nD1,25*,8 x 108\nD2,10**,8 x 107\nD3,10**,8 x 106\nD4,10**,8 x 105\nD5,10**,8 x 104",
