    "1.  EHT Generation and Culture Conditions\nManufacture of fibrin-based EHT was performed as described elsewhere 4. In brief, to generate fibrin-based EHT for implantation purposes, a master mix was prepared containing cells isolated from neonatal ROSA/luciferase-LEW transgenic rat hearts, bovine fibrinogen and Matrigel. Agarose casting molds were prepared using Teflon spacers placed in 6-well culture dishes. After solidification of agarose, spacers were removed and silicone post racks were placed on culture dishes with posts reaching into the molds. To generate EHT, the mastermix was briefly mixed with a calculated amount of thrombin and pipetted into the mold. After polymerisation of fibrinogen, silicone racks with EHTs adhering to the posts were gently removed from the agarose casting molds, transferred to new 6-well cell culture dishes and maintained in a 37°C, 7% CO2 cell culture incubator using custom-made cell culture medium.\nEHT were kept under cell culture conditions until day ten. During this time span, neonatal rat heart cells began to elongated, interconnect and align along force lines in between silicone posts. At the time of implantation, spontaneous coherent contractions were observed, deflecting silicone posts.\n2.  EHT Implantation\nEHT implantation was performed in either immunocompetent Brown Norway (BN) rats, or immunodeficient nude rats to investigate the allogeneic immune response. BN and nude rats weighing 100 - 150 g were purchased from Charles River Germany (Sandhofer Weg 7, D-97633 Sulzfeld) and  housed under conventional conditions, fed standard rat chow and water ad libidum. Immunodeficient rats are housed in sterile bedding, cages, and sterilized water is used. The German ethical review committee reviewed and approved the animal procedures. All surgical instruments are sterilized prior to use.\nThe implantation procedure are performed as follows:",
    "Rat are anesthesized with isoflurane (2.5-3%) using an induction chamber. Human exposure to isoflurane can be reduced by working in a downdraft table or non-recirculating hood. Body temperature is maintained during the surgical procedure.\nShave abdominal area and apply eye ointment to prevent the eyes from drying during anesthesia.\nPlace the rat on its back and place a facemask over its nose and mouth to keep up the anesthesia.\nDisinfect the abdominal area using Betadine and then 80% ethanol. Swab from clean to dirty, from center of shaved area moving outward toward the haired area.\nCheck reflexes pinching the hind feet to be sure that the rat is sufficiently anesthetized.\nDrape the animal and perform a midline abdominal incision separating the skin and muscle in two steps to open the abdomen. Hot bead sterilization is used between skin and muscle opening.\nPlace the intestines in a warmed saline moisturized powder free glove. Fold the glove around the intestines to prevent loss of moisture.\nRemove fatty tissue and expose the spleen.\nVisualize and spread greater omentum with forceps.\nCarefully cut EHT from suspending silicone posts and transfer onto the greater omentum.\nWrap the greater omentus around the EHT and fix using two single 7-0 prolene sutures (Ethicon, Norderstedt, Germany)\nNext move the intestines back into the abdomen.\nFlush the abdomen with prewarmed sterile saline.\nClose the muscle layer of the abdominal wall using 6-0 prolene running sutures (Ethicon, Norderstedt, Germany).\nUse 5-0 prolene (Ethicon, Norderstedt, Germany) running sutures to close the skin.\nWhile the rat is still in anesthesia, inject 5 mg/kg Carprofen subcutaneously.\nTo provide sufficient analgesia for this type of procedure, an analgesic (such as Metamizol) is added to the drinking water (50 mg Metamizol per 100 ml) for pain medication for 3 days post transplantation.",
    "3.  Bioluminescence Imaging of EHT Following Implantation\nThe IVIS bioimaging platform (Xenogen, Alameda, CA, USA) is used for non-invasive bioluminescence imaging in-vivo and results are analyzed using the IVIS Living Image (Xenogen) software package. Imaging is performed daily starting 2 hours postoperatively.\nAnesthetize rat with isoflurane (2.5 - 3%) using an induction chamber.\nDisinfect the abdominal and thoracic area widely using Provo-Iodine, next use 80% ethanol, repeat this step three times.\nInject d-Luciferin (Xenogen; 375 mg/kg body weight) i.p.\nPlace anaesthetized rats into the IVIS imaging chamber (up to 4 rats can be analysed at the same time).\nAssess signal intensity of luc+ cells inside EHT in units of photons/sec/cm2/steridianin the region of interest (ROI) at baseline (120 minutes after implantation) and at days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, and at weeks 2, 3 and 4. Note the peak signal (appears around 20 minutes after d-Luciferin injection).\nCreate a graph (Excel) showing the signal intensity over time.\n4.  Correlation of BLI Results and ELISPOT\nThe cellular in-vivo immune responses in immunocompetent BN and immunodeficient nude rats were studied after EHT transplantation. The spleen of recipient animals was harvested 5 days after EHT transplantation to isolate recipient splenocytes. Elispot assays using mitomycin-inhibited EHTs (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as stimulator and 5 x106 recipient splenocytes as responder cells were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD Biosciences) using IFN-γ and IL-4 coated plates to investigate TH1-, and TH2 response, respectively. IFN-γ- and IL-4 spots were significantly higher in the immunocompetent, model compared to the immunodeficient model (IFN-γ: p= 0.001; IL-4: p=0.023; Student's t-test).\n5.

    "Figure 1. Correlation of BLI results and ELISPOT a) The cellular in vivo immune responses in immunocompetent Brown Norway and immunodeficient nude rats were studied after EHT implantation. Recipient splenocytes were harvested 5 days after EHT implantation. IFN? and IL-4 expression was evaluated by ELISpot assays using mitomycin-inhibited EHT as stimulators and 5x106 recipient splenocytes as responder cells. Th1 and Th2 responses were significantly higher in the immunocompetent model compared to the immunodeficient model as evidenced by IFNγ- and IL-4 production respectively. b) Luc+ EHTs were transplanted into the greater omentus of either immunocompetent BN rats or immunodeficient nude rats. Cell survival was longitudinally followed by BLI. The rate of animals that rejected the transplanted EHTs is presented. All BN rats rapidly rejected the EHT transplants, whereas the cells survived in T cell deficient rats. \nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
