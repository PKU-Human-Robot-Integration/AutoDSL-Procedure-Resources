    "Mouse livers used to optimize this procedure21 were from 12 male BKS-DB/Nju background mice (7.2 weeks old, see the Table of Materials). Animal use was approved by Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University Animal Care and Ethics Committee, IACUC Issue No. WDRM 20181113.\n1 Animal tissues\nWeigh mouse liver (1-1.8 g of whole liver from each mouse).\nRapidly freeze the mouse liver in liquid nitrogen and store it at -80 °C.\n2. Preparation of buffer and reagents\nPrepare glycogen isolation buffer containing 5 mM Tris,150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, and 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate with deionized water, and adjust the pH to 8.\nPrepare 30% (w/w) sucrose solution (found to be most optimal for liver glycogen21).\nPrepare sodium acetate buffer (1 M, pH 4.5), acetic acid buffer (0.1 M, pH 3.5), sodium hydroxide solution (0.1 M), and sodium cyanoborohydride (1 M).\nPrepare 8-aminopyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (APTS) solution by adding 5 mg of APTS to 50 µL of 15% glacial acetic acid.\nPrepare ammonium nitrate solution containing 50 mM ammonium nitrate with 0.02% sodium azide.\n3. Glycogen extraction (Figure 2)\nTransfer the frozen liver tissue (~1 g) to a 15 mL tube containing 6 mL of glycogen isolation buffer.\nKeeping it on ice, homogenize the liver tissue using a tissue homogenizer.\nTransfer half of the suspension (3 mL) to a new tube and boil for 10 min (shown to be optimal for glycogen structural studies21). Keep the other half of the suspension (3 mL) on ice to extract glycogen containing associated proteins that are not denatured.\n\tNOTE: Unboiled samples should always be kept on ice during glycogen extraction steps. If glycogen proteins are not important for study, the whole sample can undergo the 10 min boiling step.",
    "Remove an 8 µL aliquot from each tube, keep the aliquots on ice, and use them for the glycogen content determination (see section 4).\nCentrifuge the remaining suspension at 6,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C.\nTransfer the supernatants to ultracentrifuge tubes, and centrifuge them at 3.6 × 105 g for 90 min at 4 °C.\nDiscard the remaining supernatants and resuspend the pellets in 1.5 mL of glycogen isolation buffer.\nLayer the samples over 1.5 mL of 30% sucrose solution in 4 mL ultracentrifuge tubes and centrifuge at 3.6 × 105 g for 2 h at 4 °C.\nDiscard the remaining supernatants and resuspend the pellets in 200 µL of deionized water.\nAdd 800 µL of absolute ethanol to the suspensions and mix well to precipitate glycogen23,24. Store the mixtures at -20 °C for at least 1 h to allow precipitation.\nCentrifuge the samples at 6,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatants and resuspend the pellets in 200 µL of deionized water.\nRepeat this ethanol precipitation process 3x and resuspend the final glycogen pellet in 200 µL of deionized water.\nRemove an aliquot of 8 µL from each tube for glycogen content determination (see section 4).\nFreeze the remaining supernatants in liquid nitrogen and freeze-dry (lyophilize) overnight. Store the dry glycogen samples in the freezer at -20 °C.\n\t​NOTE: The dry glycogen samples should be stable at -20 °C; however, there are no data to indicate how long they last without any structural changes.\n4. Glycogen content determination (Figure 3)",
    "Add 8 µL of the glycogen supernatants, (see sections 3.13 and 3.4), 5 µL of amyloglucosidase (3269 U/mL), and 100 µL of sodium acetate buffer (1 M, pH 4.5) to a microcentrifuge tube and fill the tube to the 500 µL mark with deionized water.\nPrepare controls that use deionized water instead of amyloglucosidase.\nIncubate the samples at 50 °C for 30 min, while keeping the controls on ice.\nCentrifuge at 6,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and mix 300 µL of each resulting supernatant with 1 mL of glucosidase oxidase/peroxidase (GOPOD) reagent.\nConstruct a calibration curve by mixing 300 µL of denionized water containing 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 µg of D-glucose with 1 mL of GOPOD reagent.\nIncubate the mixtures at 50 °C for a further 30 min.\nRead the absorbance (510 nm) of each sample using 96-well plates (150 µL per well) using a UV-vis spectrophotometer.\nSubtract the absorbances of control samples (with no amyloglucosidase) from the absorbances of experimental samples, then calculate the glycogen content based on the D-glucose standard curve.\n5. Crude yield, glycogen yield, and purity determination\nFor the crude yield, weigh the freeze-dried glycogen sample and calculate the yield as a percentage of the wet liver tissue.\n\tNOTE: This yield should be adjusted to correct for the aliquots taken in each glycogen content step.\nFor glycogen purity, determine the glycogen content in the final pellets, as described in section 4. Calculate the purity as a percentage of the determined glycogen content relative to the crude yield (see step 5.1).",
    "For glycogen yield, determine the glycogen content of the homogenized samples without boiling and before any centrifugation, as described in section 4. Calculate the glycogen yield as a percentage of the glycogen content in the final pellets (see step 5.2) to that of the glycogen content determined in the initial homogenate.\n6. Analysis of chain-length distributions (Figure 4)\nWeigh 0.5 mg of freeze-dried glycogen in 1.5 mL tubes.\nAdd 90 µL of deionized water and 1.5 µL of sodium azide (0.04 g/mL) to the tubes.\nAdd 5 µL of acetic acid buffer (0.1 M, pH 3.5) and 2 µL of isoamylase solution (180 U/mg) to the tubes to debranch the glycogen.\nIncubate the samples at 37 °C for 3 h.\nAdd 5 µL of sodium hydroxide solution (0.1 M) to the samples to increase the pH to 7.0.\nFreeze the samples in liquid nitrogen and freeze-dry (lyophilize) overnight.\nAdd 2 µL of APTS solution (5 mg of APTS in 50 µL of 15% glacial acetic acid) and 2 µL sodium cyanoborohydride (1 M) to the freeze-dried debranched glycogen.\nCentrifuge the samples at 4,000 × g for 2 min.\nIncubate the samples at 60 °C for 3 h in the dark.\n\tNOTE: The tube can be covered with aluminum foil to protect the contents from light.\nAdd 200 µL of deionized water to the samples and vortex them until all precipitate is dissolved.\nCentrifuge the samples at 4,000 × g for 2 min.\nTransfer aliquots of 50 µL to fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE) micro-vials for analysis.\n\t​NOTE: The data are shown as the relative abundance of (debranched) chains (Nde(X)) for each degree of polymerization (DP, symbol X).\n7. Analysis of molecular size distributions (Figure 5)",
    "Dissolve 0.5 mg of freeze-dried glycogen in 50 mM ammonium nitrate and 0.02% sodium azide at 1 mg/mL.\nIncubate the samples in a thermomixer at 80 °C for 3 h at 300 rpm.\nInject the samples into an SEC system using a pre-column and 1000 Å and 10,000 Å columns at 80 °C with a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min (see the Table of Materials). Use a refractive index detector to determine the relative weight of molecules at each elution volume.\nUsing pullulan standards (PSS) with molar masses ranging from 342 to 1.22 × 106, plot an SEC universal calibration curve to convert the elution time to Rh (hydrodynamic radius). Express the data from the differential refractive index (DRI) detector as an SEC weight distribution w (log Rh) as a function of Rh.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
