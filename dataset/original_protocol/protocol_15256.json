  "procedures": [
    "1. In-situ Lung Perfusion and Fixation\nAnesthetize mice by i.p. injection of ~150 μl phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 112.5 mg/kg (body weight) ketamine, 16.5 mg/kg xylazine, and 15 mg/kg acepromazine (or by another anesthesia containing appropriate pain killers).\nWhen reflexes of the mouse are no longer observed, fix it on the operating table back-down and wet the fur with 70% Ethanol to slick the hairs down.\nOpen the skin from the abdomen up to the neck and pull it to the sides or remove it.\nOpen the peritoneum and the thorax to an ample size. Prevent ruptures of big vessels (e.g. the vena jugularis) to avoid reduced efficiency of the subsequent perfusion.\nCut the vena cava caudalis underneath the liver.\nUse a 20 ml syringe equipped with a 21G - 24G needle to inject slowly 10-15 ml PBS into the right ventricle of the beating heart until the lung is completely white and the heart stops beating (asystole).\nPinch off the blood vessels above the liver and the diaphragm with a vascular clamp.\nUse a 10 ml syringe equipped with a 21G - 24G needle to inject ~2 ml of 3% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS into the right ventricle.\nUncover the trachea outside of the thorax. Use the same syringe to inject ~3 ml of 3% PFA in PBS cranial (outside of thorax) into the trachea until the lung is inflated. Immediately after removal of the needle, pinch off the trachea caudal of the puncture with a vascular clamp and wait for 10 min to allow fixation.\nTransect the blood vessels above the vascular clamp, remove the clamp and inject ~2 ml PBS into the right ventricle to remove excess PFA.",
    "Puncture the lower parts of all lung lobes with a needle, remove the vascular clamp at the trachea and inject 3-5 ml of a solution of PolyFreeze embedding medium/PBS 1:1 into the trachea caudal of the first puncture until the PFA in the lung lobes is replaced by the solution.\nRemove the lung carefully by pulling the heart with a forceps and by transecting connective tissue ligaments, blood vessels and the trachea. Keep the heart connected to the lungs.\nDepending on how to proceed with the lung tissue analysis continue with the protocols outlined in sections 2 or 3. If you want to do both analyses, remove one lung lobe and proceed as described under 3. Process the remaining lobes connected to the heart as described under 2.\n2. Visualization of lacZ-tagged Metastatic Tumor Cells in Entire Lung Lobes\nPlace the lung in a plastic cup with tight closing lid and fix it with 2% formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 30-60 min.\nRemove fixation solution and wash thoroughly 3 times with PBS.\nAdd at least 10 ml freshly prepared 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactoside (X-Gal) staining solution (X-Gal stock solution [40 mg/ml in Dimethylformamide] 1:40 diluted in Basic Staining Solution; pH 7.1 (Table 1); protect from light).\nPut a piece of gauze on top of the swimming lung to keep it completely in the solution and place the lid only loosely on the pot to allow exchange of air.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 3-5 hr protected from light.\nRemove X-Gal solution, rinse once with PBS to remove residual X-Gal solution (optional) and add 4% PFA.\n3. Visualization of lacZ-tagged Metastatic Tumor Cells in Lung Cryosections",
    "Prefill a labeled embedding mold to 1/3 with undiluted PolyFreeze embedding medium. Put the lung lobe on top and fill up with embedding medium until the lobe is completely covered. Try to prevent bubbles.\nIncubate the embedded lungs at 4 °C for 20 min.\nThen freeze the embedded lungs slowly in a mixture of dry ice and Isopentane and store at -80 °C.\nCut 7-10 μm cryosections on a cryostat and mount them on SuperFrostPlus microscope slides.\nIncubate the sections immediately with X-Gal staining solution at 37 °C for 24 hr in a humidified chamber.\nRinse the slides in PBS 2 times for 5 min and then briefly in distilled water.\nCounter-stain with nuclear fast red for 10-30 sec, rinse in distilled water and mount the slides with Immu-Mount.\n4. Representative Results",
    "Asai et al. reported in the original article on the Dunn-derived LM8 OS mouse model that s.c. primary tumors derived from the parental Dunn cells, different from those derived from the highly metastatic LM8 sub cell line, do not spontaneously form detectable lung metastases in syngeneic C3H mice14. With the here reported techniques, we reinvestigated the formation of metastases in the Dunn/LM8 mouse OS models. We took advantage of stable lacZ-transduced Dunn and LM8 cells and of a protocol for in-situ lung perfusion and fixation in mice. Representative images of perfused and non-perfused lungs of mice subcutaneously injected with lacZ-transduced and non-transduced control Dunn and LM8 cells are shown in Figure 1. In mice injected with control Dunn cells, macroscopic and microscopic metastases remained undetectable in non-perfused and perfused lungs (Figure 1A, i-iv). But, interestingly, in mice injected with Dunn-lacZ cells, X-gal staining revealed blue micrometastatic foci of single cells or small cell clusters (< 0.1 mm) on the surface of non-perfused lungs (Figure 1A, vi). In-situ perfusion and fixation of the lungs further improved the detectability of Dunn-lacZ micrometastases (Figure 1A, viii). However, outgrowth to macroscopic foci was not observed (Figure 1A, v, vii).",
    "In mice injected with control LM8 cells, translucent, barely detectable macrometastatic foci larger than 0.1 mm in diameter were recognized in non-perfused lungs (Figure 1B, i). Perfusion of the lung (Figure 1B, iii) did not improve the detection of the foci. However, in mice injected with LM8-lacZ cells multiple X-Gal stained blue macro- (Figure 1B, v) and micrometastases (Figure 1B, vi) were detected on the surface of non-perfused organs. Moreover, perfusion of the lungs further improved the detectability of macro- and micrometastases (Figure 1B, vii-viii). Consequently, micro- and macrometastases became visible at a higher density and a larger number, mainly due to the translucency of the perfused tissue in which foci underneath the organ surface became also visible.\nAn additional histological analysis using cryosections of lung tissue confirmed the improved detectability of lung metastases in mice injected with lacZ-transduced Dunn and LM8 cells. In mice with primary tumors derived from Dunn-lacZ or LM8-lacZ cells, unlike in mice with primary tumors of the respective control cells, micrometastases or even single cell foci were recognized in lung sections (Figure 2). Moreover, macrometastases were also more clearly visible in mice injected with LM8-lacZ cells than in animals injected with the control LM8 cells (Figure 2C, D).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4162/4162fig1.jpg",
