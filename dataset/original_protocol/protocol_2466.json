    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nIsolation of Pancreatic Islets\nTiming: 3–6 h\nPancreatic islets approximately constitute only 1%–2% of the pancreas. This step digests the pancreatic exocrine tissue through a collagenase reaction. The pancreas is inflated with the collagenase solution in order to increase the efficiency of breakdown. The islets are then isolated through a density gradient before being handpicked to include only healthy-looking, intact islets.\nInflating mouse pancreas\nSacrifice mouse with CO2 asphyxiation or other approved methods. Confirmation of successful euthanasia can be done through assessment of heartbeat or toe pinch.\nPlace the mouse ventral side up and douse with 70% ethanol. Pinch the skin around the urethral opening and lift upwards slightly. Create an incision with the surgical scissors through to the abdominal cavity. Starting from the incision point, cut along the lateral side of the mouse until around the forelimbs. Repeat this on the opposite side.\nOpen the abdominal cavity to expose the internal organs.\nGently shift the intestinal organs to the left side of the mouse.\nUnder the dissecting microscope, locate the bile duct and follow it posteriorly until it reaches the small intestine. Clamp the bile duct close to the sphincter of Oddi with the bulldog clamp to prevent the collagenase solution from entering the intestine during pancreas inflation.\nGently lift the liver to locate the gallbladder. Under the dissecting microscope, follow the bile duct until the bifurcation and use the small curved surgical scissors to make a small incision (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). The size of the incision should be just enough to accommodate a 30G needle.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/210-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Inflation of Pancreas\n(A) Close-up image of the bile duct. The incision point for needle insertion is denoted by a blue circle.\n(B) The abdominal cavity showing the pancreas before inflation.",
    "(C) The inflated pancreas after collagenase injection through the bile duct. BD, bile duct; GB, gallbladder; IP, incision point; P, pancreas; SO, sphincter of Oddi.\nFill a 5 mL syringe with collagenase solution and use a 30G needle to inject the collagenase solution into the bile duct under the dissecting microscope. If the inflation is successful, the pancreas will start to expand immediately and turn from opaque (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) to translucent (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). If the needle was not inserted successfully, another attempt can be made by creating a new incision point further posterior on the intact portion of the duct. Continue to inflate the pancreas until it stops expanding.\nRemove the bulldog clamp. Using the flat end of the curved scissors, carefully separate the attachments between the small intestine and the inflated pancreas by gliding the scissors between the two organs.\nCut the attachments between the inflated pancreas and the stomach (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/210-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Detaching Pancreas from Surrounding Organs\nBlack arrows indicate the points to detach between the pancreas and (A) stomach or (B) large intestine. LI, large intestine; P, pancreas; S, stomach.\nCut the attachments between the inflated pancreas and the large intestine (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nGently pick up the inflated pancreas and remove the final attachments with the spleen. Move the pancreas to a 50 mL tube filled with 5 mL of the collagenase solution for rinsing.\nProceed with pancreas inflation with the rest of the samples and place them in 5 mL collagenase before proceeding to the next step.\nCritical: Take extra care to ensure that the whole circumference of the duct is not cut when making the incision point, as it will become extremely difficult to insert the needle.\nCritical: Dissections must be completed within 1 h to prevent excessive digestion in the collagenase solution.",
    "Move all of the pancreata into separate 50 mL tubes filled with 20 mL collagenase solution.\nTransfer the tubes to a 37°C water bath and set a timer for 20 min. When 10 min are remaining, shake the tubes vigorously every 2 min until the timer rings.\nCritical: Optimization of incubation time may be necessary as collagenase activity can vary by lot. Examine if islets are under- or over-digested during handpicking.\nAdd 15 mL of RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS into each tube.\nSpin at 200 × g for 2 min at 4°C.\nAspirate supernatant with a vacuum until 5 mL of the solution is left, taking care not to disturb the pellet.\nAdd 25 mL of the 0.02% BSA solution in HBSS to wash the pellet and centrifuge again at 200 × g for 2 min. Repeat this wash for a total of three times.\nAfter the third wash, resuspend the pellet in 10 mL 0.02% BSA solution in HBSS and gently vortex to resuspend.\nFilter the suspension through a 1,000 μm Spectra Mesh woven filter. Rinse the tube with another 10 mL of 0.02% BSA solution in HBSS and pour through the 1,000 μm filter.\nSpin solution at 200 × g for 2 min at 4°C. Remove the supernatant by decanting and use a Kimwipe to wipe off the remaining HBSS on the inside of the tube.\nResuspend the pellet in 5 mL Histopaque-1077 and add another 5 mL to the side of the tubes to prevent any islets from attaching to the tube wall.\nAlternatives: Although Histopaque-1077 is an optimal component for the density gradient (McCall et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]), lymphocyte separation medium 1.077 g/mL may also be used if Histopaque-1077 is unavailable.",
    "Carefully tilt the tubes at a 30° angle and very slowly add 10 mL serum-free RPMI 1640 medium to the side of the tubes to create a Histopaque-1077 and RPMI 1640 medium interface.\nChange the centrifuge settings to minimal acceleration with no braking and spin the tubes at 1,800 × g for 20 min. The islets will migrate to the interface, while islets with infiltration may be further down the tube.\nUse a disposable plastic dropper pipet to transfer the islets into a 50 mL tube filled with 20 mL RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS, while taking care not to disturb the pellet.\nSpin at 200 × g for 3 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant and add 20 mL of serum-containing media. Repeat this wash for a total of three times.\nResuspend the islets in 5 mL of serum-containing media and transfer the resuspended islets to a 60 mm petri dish. Rinse the tube with an additional 5 mL of serum-containing media and transfer to the petri dish.\nCarefully handpick islets with a 20 uL pipette using a 20× to 40× stereo microscope with bottom lighting (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) and transfer them to a 15 mL tube with 2 mL of serum-containing media.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/210-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Microscopic Evaluation of Isolated Islets\nRepresentative image of isolated islets of varying size from a 4-week-old female NOD mouse (A) before and (B) after handpicking. Images were taken under a stereo microscope with bottom lighting at 20× magnification.\nOnce all of the islets are collected, add 10 mL of sterile serum-containing media with antibiotics/antimycotics to the tube.\nSpin at 200 × g for 3 min at 4°C. Repeat this wash for a total of three times.",
    "Transfer islets to a sterile 60 mm petri dish and incubate overnight (14–16 h) at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nCritical: Ensure that the dish is not tissue culture-treated as the islets have to stay in suspension.\nDissociation of Pancreatic Islets\nTiming: 1–2 h\nAcquiring single-cell suspensions with high viability from isolated pancreatic islets.\nTransfer islets and media to 15 mL tubes and centrifuge at 200 × g for 3 min at 22°C–23°C.\nAspirate supernatant and wash islets with 10 mL of prewarmed phosphate-buffered saline.\nSpin at 200 × g for 3 min at 22°C–23°C. Carefully aspirate as much of the supernatant as possible.\nAdd 2 mL of Accutase solution and put the tubes in a 37°C water bath. Set a timer for 30 min. When 15 min have passed, pipet up and down ten times every 5 min until time is up.\nStop the reaction by adding 10 mL of prewarmed serum-containing media.\nFilter the cell solution through a 40 μm cell strainer. Rinse the tube and strainer with additional media and combine with the cell solution.\nSpin at 200 × g for 3 min at 22°C–23°C. Repeat this wash for a total of three times.\nAspirate supernatant until around 100–300 μL of solution is left. Gently shake the tube to resuspend cells.\nCritical: Proper optimization of this step is crucial for obtaining a single-cell suspension with high viability. We strongly recommend optimizing this step before continuing forward with library preparation. As the enzymatic activity of Accutase may vary by lot, it may be necessary to optimize incubation time if the cells have low viability or are not in a single-cell suspension. Furthermore, ensure that pipetting force remains consistent throughout.\nLibrary Preparation for Single-Cell Transcriptomics\nDetermine cell number and viability prior to preparing single-cell RNA-seq libraries.",
    "Take 10 μL of the cell solution and mix thoroughly with 10 μL of trypan blue. Load the mixture into a Countess II or other available automated cell counters (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/210-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Representative Image of Cell Viability Assessed by an Automated Cell Counter\nMeasurement of cell viability following dissociation of pancreatic islets into a single-cell suspension was performed by mixing the cell suspension with trypan blue at a 1:1 ratio before being loaded onto the Countess II automated cell counter. Cells outlined in green are live, while cells outlined in red are dead.\nPrepare libraries for single-cell RNA-seq according to manufacturer's instructions for a single-cell RNA library preparation kit.\nCritical: Using an automated cell counter is preferred over manual counting to minimize the time the samples spend idling on ice.\nNote: Following the single-cell RNA-seq, the data can be analyzed by Monocle (Qiu et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]), Seurat (Stuart et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]), or other available platforms."
