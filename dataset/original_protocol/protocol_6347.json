    "Note: Work routinely with gloves and lab safety equipment (i.e., lab-coat, protective eye goggles). The beginning steps do not need sterile work conditions. However, after the initial isolation of the yeast, work in a laminar hood or near a burner. Yeast isolation from vessels and control samplesPut the sherds in a plastic container and cover them with sterile liquid YPD medium.Incubate at room temperature without shaking for 7 days.Spread 0.1 ml samples from the medium on selective agar plates for fungal isolation and incubate at 30 °C for 12 to 48 h.Inspect the plates frequently for the appearance of yeast colonies (Figure 2A).Note: Yeast colonies usually grow faster than molds and filamentous fungi. Do not wait for more than 48 h or the plate will be covered by molds and filamentous fungi.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191222/20191222010502_6984.jpgFigure 2. Yeast colonies and cells. Yeast have typical colonies and cell morphology both of which are distinct from molds and bacteria. A. several types of yeast colonies isolated from ancient vessels (Aouizerat et al., 2019). In general, yeast colonies are relatively large with a shiny white color in contrast to bacterial colonies which are usually small and matte. B. Yeast cells observed under light microscopy (60x). Note that yeast cells are usually bigger than typical bacteria and many kinds of yeast divide by budding rather than fission. C. Upper panel, a selective agar plate for fungal isolation was plated as described in the Procedure A of Part II. Note the low number of bacterial colonies due to the antibiotics (blue circle), structure of molds (green circle) and distinctive shiny colony of yeast (red circle). In the bottom panel, a yeast colony which was picked and re-streaked on a YPD plate (red arrow).",
    "Collect any colony which seems to be a yeast colony, observe for typical yeast cells using light microscopy (Figure 2B) and plate it on solid YPD agar plates, containing 2% w/v Bacto-agar (Figure 2C).Incubate the plates at 30 °C for 24-48 h until yeast colonies are clearly observed.Note: If a mixture of molds and yeast grow, re-pick a separate yeast colony to a new YPD plate and repeat Step A6. Inspect the colonies visually and under light microscope (60x magnification) for typical yeast cells which are distinct from bacteria colonies (Figure 2).To make a frozen stock of the yeast, pick a single colony to 5 ml YPD broth and incubate it for 24 h at 30 °C, in a shaker incubator under aerobic conditions with agitation (250-300 rpm).Mix 0.5 ml of the culture with sterile 0.5 ml glycerol (50%), vortex to mix, aliquot and store at -80 °C.Yeast CharacterizationYeast DNA isolationNote: Yeast cell DNA isolation was performed as previously described (Holm et al., 1986). Select a yeast containing tube from the -80 °C and allow to defrost at room temperature. When thawed, perform isolation streak on a YPD plate and incubate at 30 °C until colonies are observed (about 48 h).Transfer a single colony to 10 ml YPD broth in a sterile 100 ml flask. Grow the yeast overnight at 30 °C with 200 rpm shaking.Transfer the culture to 50 ml Falcon tube and centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 5 min. Pour out the supernatant, re-suspend the pellet in sterile water, re-centrifuge and discard the supernatant.In a fume hood, add 200 µl of Phenol:chlorophorm:Isoamyl alcohol, 0.3 g acid washed glass beads and 200 µl of Smash and Grab solution and vortex for 3 min in order to lyse the cells.Add 0.",
    "2 ml TE buffer and centrifuge the cells at 1,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature.Transfer the aqueous layer containing the DNA to 1 ml ethanol and incubate it for 20 min at -80 °C.Wash by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 5 min and re-suspend in 0.4 ml TE buffer.Note: DNA pellet is transparent and can be difficult to see–avoid losing the pellet. Add 1 µl of RNase A.Incubate the solution at 37 °C for 5 min.Add 10 µl of ammonium acetate (4 M) and 1ml of 70% ethanol and incubate for 20 min at -80 °C.Centrifuge at maximal speed for 10 min (at least 15K x g) and discard the supernatant.Re-suspend the pellet in 50 µl of TE buffer.Quantify the DNA using Qubit, it should be 10-20 µg/ml.Store the extracted DNA at -20 °C.Yeast identification by internal transcribed spacer (ITS)Note: For rapid and cheap identification you can use sanger sequencing of the ITS region. Keep in mind that the specific yeast species might not be represented in the database and thus full genome sequencing is preferable. Amplify the ITS region using Standard PCR kit and program with Illumina’s primers: ITS1F; ACACTGACGACATGGTTCTACACTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA and ITS2R; TACGGTAGCAGAGACTTGGTCTGCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC.Send the PCR fragments for Sanger sequencing.BLAST the sequence results against the ISHAM barcoding database (http://its.mycologylab.org[href=http://its.mycologylab.org]) and the NCBI database (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ Blast.cgi[href=https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ Blast.cgi]).Full genome sequencing and assemblyNote: DNA sequencing can be performed using any common NGS technology. Our libraries were prepared using a Nextera XT DNA kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA), and the DNA was amplified by a limited-cycle PCR followed by purification using AMPure XP beads. The DNA libraries were normalized, pooled, and tagged in a common flow cell at 2 x 250 base-paired-end reads using the NextSeq platform. For more detailed protocols see Aouizerat et al. (2019).",
    "The assembly also can be performed using numerous NGS analysis tools. Here we describe the analysis we performed (Aouizerat et al., 2019). Remove Illumina adaptors using Trimmomatic 0.36.Determine the quality of the reads using FastQC.Perform De-novo assembly with the Celera assembler 8.3rc2.Exclude non-target-species scaffolds using BlobTools V1.Growth curve analysis (in wort)Note: This procedure is used for the comparison of various growth parameters of yeast or bacteria in liquid under various conditions such as varying media, temperatures and addition of different compounds. Here, the growth of yeast in beer wort was performed, in order to test whether the isolated yeast might have been selected for in the past under such conditions. As a positive control we used a modern beer-producing strain of S. cerevisiae which is commercially available and as a negative control the pathogen yeast Candida parapsilosois which does not produce beer. Wort PreparationNote: The wort is prepared according to a standard recipe (Kunze and Manger, 2004). Heat water (5 L) to a pasteurization temperature of 72 °C.Add malt extract to a final concentration of 100 g/L, while thoroughly stirring, and allow to infuse together for 30 min in temperatures between 63 and 67 °C.Increase the solution temperature to 100 °C.Add 1 g/L of hops.Boil the solution for 45 min.Meanwhile prepare 5 L ice-cold water by mixing water with ice cubes.Add 1 g/L of hops once more.Let boil for an additional minute.Add the previously prepared ice-cold water (from Section f) to the mixture.Transfer the wort to a sterile flask and keep at 4 °C.Growth curve comparison Perform isolation streak of yeast from frozen stock on YPD agar plate.Incubate the plate at 30 °C for 48 h.Transfer a colony to 20 ml liquid YPD and incubate it at 30 °C, under aerobic conditions with agitation (250-300 rpm).",
    "Centrifuge the yeast at 1,000 x g for 5 min, wash in sterile PBS buffer and re-suspend the pellet in wort.Dilute the solution 1:100 in wort.Add 200 μl of the diluted solution/well of 96-well plate in triplicates or more repeats.Incubate the plate in a plate reader at 30 °C with linear shaking of 5 s every 20 min followed by an optical density (OD600) reading for 48-96 h.Export the results to a text file (Figure 3A).Fit a logistic equation using R package “growthcurver” (Figure 3B).Compare the statistical significance of the differences between the various parameters using Student's t-test.Determine the relative distance between the samples using Principal Components Analysis (PCA, R prcomp () command) (Figure 3C).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191222/20191222011544_9869.jpgFigure 3. Example of growth curve analysis. A. Growth curves were read as output from the plate reader. B. A logistic curve was fitted to each curve using R growthcurver. C. A PCA representation of the distance between the various parameters of the logistic equations of each sample. These results were adapted from Aouizerat et al., 2019."
