    "εRNA-MEND preparationThe oligo nucleotides are annealed and inserted into an AgeI-EcoRI doubly digested pLKO.1-puro vector. With the ligated vector, the U6 promoter and εRNA-coding fragment are amplified through PCR by using a pair of primers (pLKO.1 Fw SpeI: CCCACTAGTTTTCCCATGATTCCTTCATATTT; pLKO.1 Rv BglII: CCCAGATCTAAAATTGTGGATGAATACTGCC), the PCR product is digested with SpeI and BglII and inserted into pCpGfree-mcs vector. This final construct is hereinafter called p-εRNA.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160118/20160118060404_8821.pngFigure 1. A plasmid map of U6 promoter-driven εRNA expression vector (p-εRNA)The preparation of the p-εRNA loaded in a liposome carrier is based on the procedure that was previously described (Sato et al., 2012): p-εRNA or empty pCpGfree-mcs vector is formulated into lipid nanoparticles (MEND). 80 μg of p-εRNA or empty vector (in H2O) is dissolved in 120 μl of citrate buffer (12.5 mM citrate, 500 mM NaCl). Addition of this solution to 480 μl of the tertiary butanol containing YSK lipid (2,100 nmol), cholesterol (900 nmol), and 1, 2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycerol, methoxypolyethyleneglycol (150 nmol) leads to spontaneous formulation of liposomal particles (εRNA-MEND or control-MEND). The prepared εRNA-MEND is stocked at 4 °C until use.Infection of human hepatocyte-chimeric mice with HBVNote: All procedures involving the manipulation of HBV infectious materials should be conducted within biological safety cabinets (BSL3).Chimeric mice are intravenously infected with 100 μl of HBV-C in saline solution (106 copies per mouse) derived originally from patient with chronic hepatitis (Sugiyama et al., 2006).",
    "Three weeks after HBV infection, the sera are prepared by collecting blood samples from the tail vein and the efficiency of infection is confirmed by measuring the number of viral genome copies in the sera of HBV-infected chimeric mice by qPCR analysis as below:Prepare HBV DNA standard sample: The HBV plasmid (pUC19-HBV, genotype A) is subjected to a 10-fold serial dilutions in Nuclease free-H2O ranging from 1 x 103 to 1 x 109 copies/ml, and use 10 μl of this diluted sample (ranging from 1 x 10 to 1 x 107 copies/assay) as standard to quantification of HBV DNA. Set up qPCR reaction mixtures as follows (for one sample):DNA samples from sera of HBV-infected chimeric mice:table:",

Serum and liver samples can be subjected to qPCR for the quantification of DNA copy numbers of HBV or other analyses."
