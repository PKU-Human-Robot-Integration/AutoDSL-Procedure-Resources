For optimal quality, tumor samples should be collected in ice-cold sterile tumor collection medium and kept on ice during transport. We commonly use 5 mL of collection medium in a 50 mL tube, but volume can be increased for larger sized tumors (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). The tissue can be stored for a maximum of 1 h at 4°C in collection medium if needed.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2681-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Tissue collection and processing\n(A) Collected tumor tissue in a 50 mL tube containing tumor collection medium.\n(B) Preparation of necessary items for tumor tissue processing.\n(C) Tumor tissue pieces in a 10 cm dish with medium.\n(D) Pre-processing of the tumor tissue into smaller sections of 4–5 cm, to be kept either on the petri dish or in the 50 mL tube until processing.\n(E) Different steps of the tumor tissue processing into PDTFs (all in medium); left: small pile of processed PDTFs in medium, top: freshly cut PDTFs to be added to the left pile, bottom: unprocessed tissue sections in medium. For the picture, the plate was taken off the ice, but processing should always be done on ice.\n(F) Five piles of processed PDTFs in groups of 8–15 blocks (in medium) to be frozen in separate cryovials.\nScale bar in (C)–(F) indicates 1mm.\n(G) Cryovials containing freezing medium and, on the wall, a group of PDTFs.\nBefore collection, prepare aliquots of 5 mL tumor collection medium in a sterile 50 mL tube and store until usage at 4°C.",
    "Note: aliquots with collection medium can be stored for a maximum of 30 days at 4°C.\nPrepare the following material for the processing of PDTFs (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B):\nBucket with ice.\nSterile petri dish (10 cm diameter).\nSterile fine-tipped forceps.\nSterile scalpel.\nAnti-slip mat for processing on ice (optional).\nCryotubes for freezing.\nCritical: The tissue should be processed on ice as fast as possible for optimal viability. At least initially, viability should be checked directly after thawing and after ex vivo culture (see Section ‘thawing of PDTFs and setup of ex vivo culture[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3]’; troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nCollect the tumor material in the 50 mL tube and keep on ice until processing (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nTransfer the tumor tissue from the 50 mL tube in a small volume of collection medium to the petri dish on ice (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nNote: Depending on the size of the tumor tissue, the volume of collection medium in the petri dish should be between 5–10 mL. The tissue should be in contact with, but not fully floating in the medium.\nFor larger tumors, cut the tissue with the scalpel into smaller pieces of 1 × 1 cm (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D; troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nCritical: Start with cutting one small tumor piece into PDTFs and keep the remaining tissue pieces on ice either in collection medium in the petri dish or, for larger tumor resections, submerged in the 50 mL tube to avoid that the tissue dries out.\nCut each piece of the tumor tissue into tumor fragments of approximately 1 mm3 and keep the PDTFs covered with collection medium to avoid them drying out (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E, troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).",
    "Critical: Cut the tissue with a sharp scalpel and without too much pressure. Do not mash or tear the tumor tissue as this will create mechanical damage. Do not use the forceps with too much pressure as this will create damage or holes in the tissue. Change the scalpel when no longer sharp (Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nContinue processing the tumor pieces into fragments (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E) until the entire tissue has been processed into PDTFs.\nCritical: Remove any necrotic parts and blood coagulates from the tumor. If possible, the tumor material should be assessed by a pathologist before processing to identify areas with necrosis or that are non-malignant.\nMix PDTFs from different regions and pieces to ensure uniform representation of the tumor lesion and gather 8–15 fragments in small heaps on the petri dish (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nLabel round bottom cryovials and add 1 mL of freezing medium to each vial.\nNote: The use of round bottom cryovials is highly recommended to improve the retrieval and quality of the PDTFs upon thawing.\nCritical: Do not use less than 1 mL of freezing medium, otherwise the fragments will clump together.\nTransfer 8–15 fragments to each cryovial by putting them against the wall on top (handle the fragments carefully and do not drop them into the freezing medium yet) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).\nClose all the lids and flip the tubes to immerse all fragments into the freezing medium.\nTap the tubes to ensure fragments are not sticking onto each other.\nNote: The cryovials should each contain a similar number of fragments; optimal storage is 8–10 fragments per vial, but fragment numbers can be increased (up to 15 fragments per vial) for larger tumors.",
    "Critical: For freezing, the fragments should not stick to the wall of the cryovial or to each other to allow proper cryopreservation. Improperly frozen fragments (e.g., fragments not fully immersed in the freezing medium) should be removed upon thawing before continuing with the culture procedure.\nStore the cryovials in a freezing container (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) in a −80°C freezer.\nAllow for a consistent −1 °C/min freezing rate.\nAfter a temperature of −80°C has been reached (and after at least 24 h), transfer the cryovials as soon as possible to a liquid nitrogen tank and store until further usage.\nPause point: PDTFs can be cryopreserved for several years.\nOptional: PDTFs can also be used freshly without cryopreservation. It is important to note that certain immune cell populations such as granulocytic cells may die upon freezing. Cryopreservation however allows a better use of the tumor material. For instance, the specific number of fragments required for an experiment can be selected and experiments can be replicated with the same tumor to validate findings.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S1. Processing of tumor tissue lesions into PDTFs, related to steps 6 and 7\n    \nThe collected tumor tissue is cut into smaller sections and kept apart (either in the dish or in 50 mL tube containing collection medium). Each section is then processed into the small PDTFs of 1 mm3 and kept in medium in a pile. After the cutting is finished, they are mixed to ensure uniform representation of the tumor tissue. See also Figure 1.\nPreparation of the ex vivo culture\nTiming: 1.5 h\nThis section describes the setup of the ex vivo cultures.\nCritical: It is crucial to embed the tumor fragments as fast as possible as viability may dramatically decrease otherwise.",
    "The day before starting the ex vivo PDTF culture, the following steps should be taken in preparation:\nCalculate the number of fragments and the amount of matrix needed for the experiment; for calculations, see step 16 (concentration depends on Matrigel batch).\nAlways calculate an excess of matrix because of possible pipetting error (an excess of 10% is recommended).\nThaw the Matrigel for 12 h on ice at 4°C.\nNote: Other preparations include the pre-cooling of pipet tips at 4°C and preparation of the tumor culture and tumor wash media (see ‘media and reagent preparation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.2]’ section).\nNote: It is important to perform steps 15–39 for one tumor sample at a time (see note after step 39). These steps can be repeated for additional samples to set up ex vivo PDTF cultures from multiple tumors.\nBefore starting the culture, prepare the following materials (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2681-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "(F) Leftover PDTFs after emptying the cryovial into a 50 mL tube are transferred to the wall of the tube by forceps, to keep the thawing process as fast but precise as possible.\n(G) Example of an ex vivo PDTF culture in a 96-well plate. Fragments are added to the center of the 96-well plate after the bottom-layer of the matrix has solidified, followed by addition of a second layer of matrix on top of the fragments. Fragments are uniformly distributed to capture heterogeneity between conditions.\n6-well and 96-well flat bottom plates (pre-cool the 96-well plate on ice before usage), one for each tumor sample.\nFalcon Cell strainers, 70 or 100 μm.\nSterile fine-tipped forceps (use a separate pair of forceps for each tumor).\nBucket with ice.\nFour 50 mL tubes (per tumor), two of which should be cooled on ice before using them for preparing the matrix.\nPre-cool tumor medium on ice.\nPre-warm tumor wash medium to 37°C.\nCalculation of the matrix (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]):\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2681_6.csv\nThis example uses a calculation for a culture with a total of 55 wells.

    "Add the Matrigel by taking it up with a bit of the medium-collagen mix and transferring it to the 50 mL tube (Methods Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nCritical: Make sure to fully dissolve the Matrigel before transferring (no undissolved gel clumps should be visible). Often, this step has to be repeated multiple times before all the Matrigel is transferred to the final mixture\nPipet 40 μL of the matrix into each well of a pre-cooled 96-well flat bottom plate without creating air bubbles (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nTap the plate carefully to spread the matrix throughout the well.\nIncubate for 30 min at 37°C and 5% CO2 until the matrix is solid.\nNote: A p200 pipet tip can be used to test in the middle of the coated wells if the first layer of matrix is solidified. Gently touch the matrix layer with the tip (avoid making holes). When no matrix is observed inside the tip, one can continue the protocol.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S2. Matrix preparation for ex vivo PDTF culture, related to steps 17–19\n    \nAfter mixing sodium bicarbonate with collagen and tumor medium (steps 17 and 18), the medium mix is added to the Matrigel by slowly adding the medium. Important: hold the Matrigel tube at the top to not warm it with your hands while reconstituting. Matrigel is slowly resuspended in multiple steps by transferring the mixture back to the medium mix and repeating this step until the Matrigel tube is empty. Try to avoid making air bubbles during resuspension. Finish the matrix by mixing and cooling the tube before adding it to the 96-well plate. See also Figures 2A and 2B.\nIncubation point: 15 min after step 22 (incubation with the first layer of matrix), start thawing the tumor fragments.",
    "Thawing of PDTFs and setup of ex vivo culture\nTiming: 1 h preparation; 48 h culture time\nThis part of the protocol describes the thawing of PDTFs after cryopreservation and the embedding in the matrix to start the ex vivo culture.\nNote: Characterization of each tumor sample before culture can help to ensure that the tumor material is viable and contains immune cells. Measurements of these and other parameters can, for instance, be done by flow cytometry, directly after thawing the tumor fragments (see step 23–35) without ex vivo culture.\nCritical: The thawing and initial washing steps are critical to prevent cryodamage, and indicated incubation times should be followed. Avoid drying out of tumor fragments.\nCollect cryovials from the cryostorage on dry ice.\nAdd 7 mL of pre-warmed (37°C) wash medium to three wells of a 6-well plate, and add a Falcon cell strainer (both 70 or 100 μm can be used) to the second well (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nPrepare two 50 mL Falcon tubes, one also with a cell strainer.\nThaw the cryovials in a 37°C water bath until only a small clump of ice is visible (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nNote: If possible, improperly frozen fragments (e.g., fragments not properly submerged into the freezing medium) should be removed from the cryovial prior to emptying it.\nFlick the tube and pour the content of the cryovial (fragments and freezing medium) into a 50 mL tube (Methods Video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nNote: Ensure that no fragments are left in the cryovial; in case of remaining fragments, these can be removed using a pair of forceps and added to the top/rim of the 50 mL tube (flush these with some wash medium before continuing to the next step) (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E and 2F).\nAdd dropwise (very slowly, one drop per second) 10 mL of pre-warmed wash medium.",
    "Mix the fragments with the wash medium by swirling the 50 mL tube to rapidly dilute the DMSO from the freezing medium.\nCarefully swirl the 50 mL tube to avoid fragments sticking to the tube when transferring, and pour the content of the tube into a new 50 mL collection tube over a cell strainer.\nTransfer the cell strainer to the first well of the 6-well plate with the wash medium.\nNote: The cell strainer helps to collect the fragments and reduces mechanical damage as less handling with the forceps is necessary.\nWash the fragments in the first well for approximately 1–2 min by shaking them lightly.\nTransfer the fragments with the forceps to a new cell strainer in the second well to reduce leftover DMSO.\nWash the fragments in the second and third well for approximately 1–2 min by shaking them lightly.\nAfter washing, remove the fragments from the cell strainer using the forceps and use the sterile part of the lid of the 6-well plate to collect them in a drop of medium.\nCritical: Keeping the fragments in a drop of wash medium prevents them from drying out.\nCount the total number of fragments and transfer them into the matrix-coated 96-well plate. Place one fragment per well (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nCritical: Divide fragments varying in size or color equally across different treatment conditions (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G). If the size of a fragment is larger than 1 × 1 × 1 mm, cut it into smaller PDTFs.\nAdd 40 μL matrix mix on top of each tumor fragment (handle the plate at 20°C–22°C to keep the bottom layer of the matrix solidified) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G).\nIncubate for 30 min at 37°C and 5% CO2 until the matrix has solidified.",
    "Add 120 μL tumor medium and incubate for the required time period at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nNote: Cultures for up to 72 h have been performed. We however observed best results in terms of immune activation and viability for up to 48 h of culture. After 72 h, the viability will decrease substantially.\nNote: Any stimulation or treatment of interest, e.g., antibodies, cytokines, small molecules, etc. can be added to the 120 μL medium at step 39. Calculate the final concentration for a volume of 200 μL. If ex vivo cultures are performed for multiple tumors that should be treated for the same time period, first add only 100 μL medium and incubate the PDTF culture plates at 37°C and 5% CO2 until the fragments from all tumors have been embedded. Then add the remaining 20 μL of the medium ± treatment of interest and incubate the cultures for the required time period at 37°C and 5% CO2.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S3. Thawing of PDTFs for ex vivo culture, related to steps 27–36\n    \nAfter thawing a cryovial containing PDTFs (step 26), contents are poured into a 50 mL tube, followed by dropwise addition of tumor wash medium. Important: check if any fragments are stuck inside the cryotube and transfer them to the 50 mL tube using the forceps, followed by flushing the fragments to the bottom using tumor wash medium. Fragments are poured over a cell strainer, followed by extensive washing in three wells of a 6-well plate. In the second well, the fragments are transferred to a new filter. To divide fragments over different treatment conditions for ex vivo culture, they are transferred in liquid to the lid of a plate prior to adding them to the matrix. See also Figures 2C–2G.",
    "Incubation point: There is a stopping point for 48 h (maximum 72 h) when PDTFs are embedded in matrix and the treatment/stimulation has been added.\nPreparing PDTFs for analysis\nTiming: 1.5–2 h\nThis section describes the collection of supernatants and the processing of PDTFs into single cell suspensions after ex vivo culture. The collected supernatant can be used for analysis of soluble mediators secreted by the PDTFs. The fragments can be extracted from the matrix and either used for imaging analyses or be processed into single cell suspensions, for instance for assessment by flow cytometry or single-cell RNA-sequencing. For examples, please refer to.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]\nBefore starting, prepare the following materials (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2681-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "After PDTF culture, collect the 80–100 μL of supernatant that is on top of the matrix in a 96-well round bottom plate.\nWithout further preparation, seal the plate with the collected supernatants.\nStore at −80°C for later usage.\nNote: Tilt the plate when taking up the supernatant to avoid touching the tumor fragment and matrix.\nExtract the tumor fragments from the matrix using the forceps and transfer them directly into the 15 mL tube with digestion mix (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nPool fragments for each condition and mix them with the medium.\nLeave the fragments on ice until all conditions have been collected.\nNote: Sometimes, matrix residues may be partially attached to the fragments after extracting them from the culture. Nevertheless, the fragments can be directly used for digestion without prior cleaning.\nNote: Rarely, for instance in the case of very soft tumors, fragments may disaggregate in culture and collection with the forceps is not possible. In this case, collect also the matrix from the well with a p200 pipet and include it in the digestion mix to capture the disaggregated cells.\nPlace the tubes on the rotator and incubate for 1 h at 37°C and 5% CO2 under slow rotation (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C; troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nCritical: Make sure no fragments are sticking to the wall of the tube during the digestion and check for potential leakage of the tubes containing the digestion mix after approximately 10 min.\nAfter digestion (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D), keep the tube(s) on ice and top up each tube with ice-cold PBS.\nCentrifuge at 235 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nCarefully remove the supernatant without disrupting the pellet and keep the tube(s) on ice.\nPrepare a new 15 mL tube and place a nylon mesh filter on the top (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).",
    "Resuspend the cell pellet thoroughly with 5 mL of ice-cold PBS and filter the suspension through the mesh into the new 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 438 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nCarefully remove the supernatant without disrupting the pellet.\nNote: At this point, the pellet can be hardly visible. This does however not necessarily indicate lack of cells. To control for the presence of cells, a sample can be taken to count cell numbers and check viability (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F).\nResuspend the cells in the medium of choice and continue with the readout of interest.\nPreparation of supernatants for analysis of secreted mediators\nTiming: 2 h\nThis part of the protocol discusses the preparation of supernatants to measure secreted soluble mediators upon culture. To this end, approaches such as cytometric bead arrays or Luminex assays can be used.\nRetrieve supernatants from storage at −80°C and thaw them on ice.\nTo measure soluble mediators individually from each fragment, transfer the required volume from each well to the assay plate.\nNote: It is also possible to measure the averaged response of the tumor to a treatment. Therefore, supernatants first can be pooled using equal volumes from each well and then the volume required for the assay can be transferred to the assay plate.\nCritical: Supernatants can be refrozen maximally one time. Multiple freeze-thaw cycles should be avoided as this leads to degradation of soluble mediators."
