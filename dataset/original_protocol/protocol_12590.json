    "1.The DD-Cas9 vector\nObtain DD-Cas9 vector from Addgene (DD-Cas9 with filler sequence and Venus (EDCPV), Plasmid 90085).\n\t​NOTE: This is a lentiviral DD-Cas9 plasmid with a U6 promoter that drives the single guide RNA (sgRNA) transcription while the EFS promoter drives the DD-Cas9 transcription. The DYKDDDDK sequence (flag-tag) is present at the C-terminal of Cas9 followed by 2A self-cleaving peptide (P2A) that separates DD-Cas9 and modified fluorescent protein Venus (mVenus).\n2. Small guide RNA (sgRNA) design\nDesign small guide RNA (sgRNA) that will be cloned into the DD-Cas9 vector by using one of several algorithms, targeting a specific genomic region.\n\tNOTE: To reduce the off-target effects, select sgRNA sequences with the highest score by using the website: http://crispr.mit.edu.\nDesign and order two oligonucleotides per sgRNA sequence to make a complete sgRNA.\n\t​NOTE: Since the plasmid will be digested by the BsmBI enzyme, design the forward and the reverse oligonucleotide by adding BsmBI digestion overhangs to the sgRNA sequence. Use the template from Table 1.\n3. Cloning of sgRNA into the lentiviral DD-Cas9 vector\nDephosphorylate the 5′-ends of DD-Cas9 plasmid by using alkaline phosphatase (FastAP) in a restriction enzyme digestion reaction.\n\tNOTE: Vectors can re-circularize during the ligation especially when they are linearized by a single restriction enzyme. To ensure the vector will not re-circularize, de-phosphorylate the plasmid by adding phosphatase directly into the digestion reaction.\n\t\nDephosphorylate and digest the plasmid with BsmBI enzyme by preparing a mix of 5 µg of DD-Cas9 plasmid, 6 µL of digest buffer (10x), 0.6 µL of DTT (100 mM), 3 µL of BsmBI, 3 µL of FastAP, add up to 60 µL nuclease-free water to make 60 µL the total reaction volume.\n\t\tNOTE: Add the BsmBI enzyme and FastAP to the mixture in the end.",
    "Incubate the mixture for 30 min at 37 °C heat block or thermocycler.\nPurify the digested DD-Cas9 plasmid.\n\t\nPrepare an 0.8% DNA agarose gel to remove incompletely digested plasmid and traces of enzymes. Use a wider gel-comb for better separation and run the gel at 90 V.\nVisualize bands under 360-365 nm UV light and cut the larger plasmid band out of the gel. Discard the 2 kb fragment which is corresponding to the filler.\nPurify the large cut gel-band by using a commercial gel purification kit and follow the manufacturer's instructions.\nLigate annealed oligos with digested DD-Cas9 plasmid.\n\t\nPhosphorylate and anneal the sgRNA oligos.\n\t\t\nPrepare the mix of 1 µL of T4 Ligation Buffer (10x), 1 µL of Oligo 1 (100 µM), 1 µL of Oligo 2 (100 µM), 6.5 µL of nuclease-free water. Lastly, add 0.5 µL of T4 PNK. The total volume of this reaction is 10 µL.\nAdd the reaction-mix to the thermocycler with the following conditions: 37 °C for 30 min, 95 °C for 5 min, and then ramp down to 25 °C with the speed of 5 °C/min.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: The PNK must be heat-inactivated before the oligonucleotides are put into the ligation otherwise the PNK will phosphorylate the vector. The phosphorylation step and annealing step are performed together in a thermocycler. The phosphorylation step where 5' phosphate is added to the sgRNA oligonucleotides is required for the ligation to occur.\nLigate DD-Cas9 digested plasmid and sgRNA oligos.\n\t\t\nDilute the annealed oligos to 1:200 in nuclease-free water and use 50 ng of plasmid DNA in the ligation reaction.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: Use the molar ratio of the 6 insert : 1 vector, to promote insert integration or use a ligation calculator to calculate the molar ratio: http://nebiocalculator.neb.com/#!/ligation.",
    "Prepare the ligation reaction mix: 50 ng of digested and purified DD-Cas9 vector, appropriate volume of diluted annealed oligos, 1 µL of T4 Ligation Buffer (10x), 1 µL of T4 DNA Ligase, up to 10 µL nuclease-free water to obtain the total volume of the reaction 10 µL.\nIf using \"high concentration\" ligase, incubate the reaction at room temperature for 5 min. Otherwise, incubate at room temperature for 2 h, or to achieve a higher yield of ligation, incubate at 16 °C overnight.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: Heat-inactivate if using the standard T4 DNA Ligase at 65 °C for 20 minutes. Do not heat-inactivate if you are using ligase master mixes.\n4. Bacterial transformation\nPre-warm 10 cm LB-ampicillin agar plates at room temperature.\nThaw 50 µL of \"One shot Stbl3\" competent bacterial cells on ice.\nAdd 2-3 µL of ligation mixture to 50 µL of competent bacterial cells and gently mix by flicking the bottom of the tube with a finger 4 times. Incubate on ice for 30 min.\nHeat-shock the cells at exactly 42 °C for 40 seconds, using a timer. Cool down the bacterial cells on ice for 5 min.\nAdd 500 µL of SOC media without antibiotic to the bacterial cells and grow them in the shaking incubator at 250 rpm for 45 min, at 37 °C.\nSpread 100 µL of transformed bacteria on pre-warm LB-ampicillin plates and incubate overnight at 37 °C.\n5. Mini/maxi-prep of ligated plasmid\nPrepare a maxi/mini-prep starter culture.\n\t\nThe next day pick a single bacterial clone and inoculate a starter culture with 8 mL of LB media containing ampicillin.\nGrow the bacteria in the shaking incubator at 250 rpm, 37 °C for 10-12 h.",
    "Use 3-5 mL of bacteria for mini-prep or use it as a starter culture for maxi-prep. Use the rest of the bacteria as a bacterial glycerol-stock by adding 100% glycerol in the ratio of bacterial culture:glycerol is 1:1.\n\t\t​NOTE: Here, we will describe the mini-prep procedure.\nMini-prep procedure\n\t\nHarvest 3-5 mL of bacterial cells and centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 1 min.\nResuspend the pellet of bacterial cells with 200 µL of P1 buffer, containing RNase A and stored at 4 °C.\nAdd 200 µL of buffer P2 and mix gently by inverting the tube 10 times until the liquid clarifies.\nAdd 300 µL of buffer P3 and mix by inverting the tube 10 times. The liquid will become cloudy. Proceed immediately with centrifuging the samples at 12,000 x g for 10 min.\nTransfer clear supernatant to the spin column and centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 1 min.\n\t\tDiscard the flow-through.\n\t\t​NOTE: Make sure the supernatant is clarified. Particles can clog the spin column and reduce the column efficacy.\nAdd 400 µL of PD buffer and centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 1 min. Discard the flow-through.\nAdd 600 µL of PW buffer to wash the spin column and centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 1 min. Discard the flow-through.\nCentrifuge again the spin column at top speed for 3 min to remove the buffer residues. Discard the flow-through and let it sit for 2 min.\nPlace the spin column to a fresh tube and add 50 µL of elution buffer. Incubate for 5 min and centrifuge at top speed for 2 min.\nUse the nanodrop device to measure the concentration of purified DD-Cas9 plasmid with the sgRNA insert (ng/µL).",
    "Validate the sgRNA cloning by DNA sequencing of the DD-Cas9 plasmid. Use the U6 primer sequence in Table 2.\n6. Lentiviral preparation\nPrepare HEK293T packaging cells for transfection.\n\t\nUse healthy HEK293T up to passage 10 and seed them evenly at density 1-2 x 106 cells per 10 cm tissue culture plate. Use 10 mL of Glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% filtered Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS). Incubate cells in the tissue culture incubator, at 5% CO2 and 37 °C for 20 h.\nNext day, confirm that cells reached 70% confluency by brightfield microscopy and that they are evenly dispersed across the plate. Change media to cells 1 h before the transfection with the final volume of 10 mL.\n\t\t​NOTE: The media should be absent of antibiotics and antimycotics.\nPrepare the mixture of 2 tubes with 500 µL of warm media (e.g., OptiMEM).\n\t\t\nAdd 25 µL of transfection reagent to tube 1 containing warm 500 µL of media, and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\nMeanwhile prepare a mix of plasmids to tube 2 containing 3.5 µg of DD-Cas9 containing cloned sgRNA, 6 µg of the packaging plasmid (psPAX2), and 3 µg of the envelope plasmid (pMD2.G) into warm 500 µL of media.\nMix tube 1 with tube 2 to form a transfection mixture and incubate at room temperature for 20 min.\nDropwise the transfection mixture to HEK293T cells and incubate plate in the tissue culture incubator, at 5% CO2 and 37 °C overnight.\nAfter 18 h, carefully change the media to 10 mL of fresh DMEM with 10% FBS to remove the transfection reagent. Incubate for the next 48 h.\nAfter 48 h, collect the supernatant with a 10 mL syringe and pass it through a 0.45 µm filter.",
    "Aliquot and store the virus supernatant at -80 °C.\n7. Determining virus titer and transduction efficacy with flow cytometry\nSeed the HEK293T cells with 5 x 105 cells/well into a 6-well plate. Seed cells into two 6-well plates. Use one plate for counting the next day.\nIncubate the plates in the incubator at 37 °C, 95% humidity, 5% CO2 overnight to reach 50-60% confluency the next day.\nThe next day, use one of the 6-well plates to count the cells in 6 wells.\nThaw the virus aliquot that will be used to perform the serial dilution and add 8 µg/mL of polybrene reagent.\nPrepare DMEM with 10% FBS for serial dilution of the virus and add 8 µg/mL of polybrene reagent.\nPrepare 2 mL of ten-fold serial dilutions of the lentivirus from 1 x 10-1 to 1 x 10-4 in polybrene-containing media.\nRemove media from 6-well plate and add 1 mL of viral dilutions to wells. Leave one well with media alone as negative control and one well with 100% virus.\nIncubate cells with the virus in the incubator for 24 h.\nThe next day, remove the media with virus from 6-well plates and change it for 2 mL of fresh DMEM with 10% FBS. Incubate cells for 48-72 h. Observe GFP by using a fluorescent microscope every day.\nAfter 48-72 h, detach the cells and resuspend them in MACS buffer.\nUse a flow cytometer to determine the percentage of GFP expression.\nCalculate virus titer by using the following formula: TU/mL = (Number of cells transduced x Percent fluorescent x Dilution Factor)/(Transduction Volume in mL)\n8. Lentiviral transduction of target cells\nPlate the cell line of interest to a 10 cm plate and incubate overnight to reach confluency 50-60% the next day.",
    "NOTE: We used the A549 cell line expressing DD-Cas9 and two independent RPA3-gene sgRNAs. We also used the A549 cell line expressing vector with Renilla control. We seeded those cells at the density of 2 x 103cells/cm2 and incubated them at 37 °C, 95% humidity, 5% CO2 overnight to reach 50-60% confluency the next day. We used RPMI media with 10% filtered FBS. We proceeded with the next steps as follow:\nThe next day, infect the cells with 500-2000 µL of virus particles in 10 mL total volume of culture medium. Incubate viral media for 24 h.\nThe next day, change the viral media to culture media and determine the percentage of GFP positive cells by using flow cytometry.\nSelect GFP positive cells by FACS cell sorting or by using bleomycin selection.\nExpand positively selected cells and freeze a stock.\n9. Conditional induction of Cas9 mediated gene editing\nPlate positively selected cells 24 h after infection as well as untransduced cells to 12-well plate separately. Wait until the cells attach and change the media to cell culture media containing 200 nM of Shield-1. Replace the media in the plates with transduced and untransduced-cells, leaving 2 wells per plate with regular media as a negative control.\nIncubate and extract proteins from each well at different time points: time 0, 2 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after adding the Shield-1 to the wells.\nThen remove the media with Shield-1 from the rest of the wells and change it for regular cell media.\nCollect the proteins from those wells 2 h, 6 h, and 12 h after changing the media.",
    "Visualize by western blot analysis the reversibility and rapidity of destabilized DD-Cas9 protein regulation after the addition and the withdrawal of its ligand, Shield-1. Use antibody directed towards DYKDDDDK Tag to visualize proteins and a control antibody targeting for example beta-tubulin.\nDetermine the optimal dose of Shield-1 by dose-response curve observed by Western Blot analysis.\n10. Validation of gene editing\nNOTE: The GFP expression assays, such as flow cytometry analysis and bleomycin selection marker only confirm successful CRISPR reagent delivery but they do not determine if the desired sequence was successfully targeted. The most common assays to confirm successful gene targeting by the CRISPR experiment are Sanger DNA sequencing, Next-generation sequencing, the Surveyor Nuclease Assay, the Tracking of Indels by Decomposition (TIDE) Assay, or western blot analysis16,17,18.\nPlate positively selected cells and change media to 200 nM of Shield-1 containing media. Incubate cells for 5 days, changing media with Shield-1 every 3 days.\nUse the above-mentioned validation techniques 5 days after DD-Cas9 induction by Shield-1.\nSubscription Required.
