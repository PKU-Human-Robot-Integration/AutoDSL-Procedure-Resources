    "1. Skin Biopsy and Culturing of Human Fibroblasts\nThe skin biopsy has to be taken by an experienced physician. The procedure takes place under sterile conditions and requires local anesthesia. Typical sites used for biopsy are the inner side of the upper arm, shoulder or lower back.\nYou can take 4x4mm or 6x6mm diameter specimen by punch biopsy to get enough tissue for culturing human fibroblasts.\nCut the skin biopsy into equal small pieces under sterile conditions to separate them into 2-4 T25 flasks. Every flask should contain 2-3 pieces of epidermis. The culture media contains 15% FCS, 1.1% sodium pyruvate and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium.\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The expected propagation time until first fibroblasts grow out of the epidermal sample is 1-2 weeks. If growth problems are encountered, you can make use of fibroblast growth factor (5-10 ng/ml FGF2) to enhance growth of cells.\nOnce a cell confluency of 50-70% is reached, the primary human fibroblasts can be frozen. The time until 50-70% confluency is reached, differs among cell lines. Freeze the fibroblasts in 90% FCS plus 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).\n2. Preparation of Human Fibroblasts for Live Cell Imaging Microscopy",
    "In general, experiments with human fibroblasts should be performed with passages below 10 as senescence-associated alterations can change properties of cells after multiple passages. In case of doubt, beta-galactosidase assays can be used to assess the induction of ageing processes in the respective cells. Generally, do not use aged fibroblasts(see above). Furthermore, to compare several cell lines, work with the same passage number of each cell line. Comparison of different genetically homogenous patients compared to healthy controls is recommended. However, as sometimes patients carrying specific mutations can be rare, this can mean that skin biopsies from only one patient with a certain passage number and different control lines have to be included - here it is essential to ensure the same passage number of all lines included. If a cell confluency of 50-70% is reached but no experiment planned, fibroblasts should be frozen.\nOn the first day of the experiment, wash the attached fibroblasts once with PBS. Then release them from the flask bottom by using a cell detachment solution of proteolytic DNase enzymes (i.e. AccuMax).\nCount your cells and seed 50,000-70,000 cells in each well of a 4-chamber coverglass (1.8 cm2 culture area per well). Accordingly, for the 8-chamber coverglas, half of the cell number or a little less is appropriate (0.8 cm2 culture area per well). It is important to seed rather a small number of cells to perform real single-cell analysis. No specific coating for the chambers is needed.\nAfter 24-48 hr, the live cell imaging experiment can be performed. Ensure that the live cell imaging microscope is equipped with an incubator that controls temperature and CO2 levels. During image acquisition, an atmosphere of 37 °C and 5% CO2 should be maintained.",
    "Each live cell imaging measurement should be carried out in at least three independent experiments. In total, a minimum of 50 cells per cell line should be imaged. The live cell imaging experiments as well as the off-line analyses have to be performed under blinded conditions to guarantee unbiased data collecting.\n3. Measurement of Mitochondrial Function in Living Human Fibroblasts\nFor conventional measurement of mitochondrial function via mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP)-dependent dyes, fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) is the primary method. In the case of human fibroblasts, cellular autofluorescence is frequently observed and may cause false positive results by interference with the actual staining signal. Autofluorescence typically becomes more pronounced with higher passage numbers of fibroblasts. Therefore, we prefer to assess mitochondrial function of human fibroblasts by live cell imaging microscopy.\n24-48 hr after seeding, incubate the fibroblasts in 50 nM of the MMP-dependent dye tetramethylrodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) in RPMI medium. This RPMI medium should lack phenol red as this can negatively affect image quality. 1.6 μM of Hoechst staining should be added to visualize nuclei.\nIncubate cells in prepared staining solution protected from light for 15 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nReplace the staining solution with RPMI medium (without phenol red). Proceed without a washing step and immediately image cells. Use 63x magnification and confocal laser scanning microscopy technique (alternatively fluorescence microscopy using Apotome technique) to define single layers of cells. Apply 37 °C and 5% CO2 to cells during imaging process.",
    "When imaging the fibroblasts, pay maximum attention to the applied exposure time of fluorescent light as TMRE staining can bleach out quickly. Define your appropriate exposure time between 200 and 300 ms and do not exceed this interval. The image acquisition under standardized settings is very important, as one would be unable to make comparisons based on intensity if the settings are different between cell lines.\nAs a defined radius around the imaged cells is bleached out after light exposure, keep the next visual field adequately far from the photobleached section.\nOff-line analyses are performed using ImageJ Software (Wayne Rasband; National Institutes of Health, USA).\nSelect your cell of interest by using a selection tool.\nConvert image to 8-bit (Image < Type < 8-bit).\nReduce unspecific noise by using the \"despeckle\" function (Process < Noise < Despeckle).\nChoose the \"Lookup Tables - Fire\" condition (Image < Lookup Tables < Fire).\nSwitch in the threshold function to the \"Over/Under\" function and adjust threshold (Image < Adjust < Threshold).\nSelect the \"analyze particles\" option, which will give you the mean gray value for each mitochondrial particle detectable (Analyze < Analyze Particles). Save the given result list as an Excel spreadsheet.\nOpen result file in Excel program and calculate the average of the mean gray value of the mitochondrial structures (indicated as 'mean' in the given excel result list).\nTo create a surface plot, choose the plugin \"Interactive 3D surface plot\" in the \"3D\" plugin section. Here, you can further adjust the plot using different display options. Changing the \"Original Colors\" to \"Spectrum LUT\" gives the intensity scale bar for the appropriate plot.",
    "Alternatively to using TMRE for analyzing the mitochondrial function of human fibroblasts via live cell imaging, a combination of the MMP-independent dye Mitotracker Green FM and the MMP-dependent dye Mitotracker CM-H2XRos can be used. Again, for human fibroblasts live cell imaging microscopy is preferred, but in general this alternative has also been used using FACS analysis in other kind of cells 12. When using this alternative approach to measure mitochondrial function in human fibroblasts, step 3-7 of the protocol section 5 \"Measurement of mitochondrio-lysosomal colocalization in living human fibroblasts\" should be applied. Therewith, the overlay of signals, both from mitochondria positive for Mitotracker Green FM and Mitotracker CM-H2XRos is calculated and indicates the amount of functional mitochondria as ratio to all mitochondria present.\n4. Measurement of Mitochondrial Morphology in Living Human Fibroblasts\n24-48 hr after seeding, incubate cells in 200 nM Mitotracker Green FM in RPMI medium (no phenol red) protected from light for 15 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. 1.6 μM of Hoechst staining should be used to highlight nuclei. Mitotracker Green FM is a MMP-independent dye, which stains all mitochondrial structures present.\nGently wash the cells once with PBS.\nAdd fresh RPMI medium (without phenol red) to cells and immediately image cells. Use 63x magnification and confocal laser scanning microscopy technique (alternatively fluorescence microscopy using Apotome technique) to define single layers of cells.\nOff-line analyses are taken out by the use of ImageJ Software.\nSelect your cell of interest by using a selection tool.\nConvert image to 8-bit (Image < Type < 8-bit).\nReduce unspecific noise by using the \"despeckle\" function (Process < Noise < Despeckle).\nUse the convolution filter to highlight mitochondrial structures (Process < Filters < Convolve).\nAdjust the threshold so that the signal-to-noise ratio is appropriate (Image < Adjust < Threshold).",
    "By using the \"analyze particles\" option, the automatic identification of mitochondrial structures is initiated based on a chosen pixel size (Analyze < Analyze Particles). Several mitochondrial parameters are subsequently calculated such as area, perimeter, minor and major axes or circularity. These measurements can be set individually (Analyze < Set Measurements). Save the given result list as an Excel spreadsheet.\nOpen result file in Excel program. With use of such parameters, analyses of mitochondrial morphology can be carried out. This includes the definition of the form factor indicating the degree of branching of a mitochondrial network [formula: (perimeter2)/(4*PI()*area)] as well as the aspect ratio defining the length of mitochondria (formula: major axes / minor axes).\n5. Measurement of Mitochondrio-lysosomal Colocalization in Living Human Fibroblasts\n24-48 hr after seeding, incubate cells in 200 nM Mitotracker Green FM and 100 nM Lyostracker Red DND-99 in RPMI medium (without phenol red) protected from light for 15 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. 1.6 μM of Hoechst staining is used to highlight nuclei.\nReplace the medium with fresh RMPI medium (without phenol red) containing 100 nM Lyostracker Red DND-99. This dye has to be present during the entire imaging session. Do not wash the cells after incubation period. Immediately image the cells. Use 63x magnification and confocal technique (alternatively Apotome technique) to define single layers of cells.\nOff-line analyses are taken out by the use of ImageJ Software.\nOpen the two respective images you would like to analyze in terms of colocalization status.\nConvert image to 8-bit (Image < Type < 8-bit).\nReduce unspecific noise by using the \"despeckle\" function in both images (Process < Noise < Despeckle).",
    "Choose the plugin \"JACoP\" as colocalization analyzing tool, which gives you values for the respective channels and calculates the Pearson's coefficient, overlap coefficient and Manders' coefficient (Plugins < JACoP).\n6. Representative Results\nMitochondrial function in living human fibroblasts can be evaluated via live cell imaging technique. For functional assays, the TMRE fluorescence signal correlates with the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Under normal MMP conditions, the TMRE fluorescence is significantly higher (Figure 1A, upper row) than under pathological conditions characterized by a reduced MMP (Figure 1A, lower row). This fluorescence intensity is measured by calculating the average of the mean gray value of every mitochondrial structure (Figure 1B). The fluorescence intensity can be measured via ImageJ software. Here, the use of the option \"interactive surface plot\" allows for the illustration of different peak intensities (Figure 1A, right side).",
    "Next to the assessment of mitochondrial function in human fibroblasts, live cell imaging microscopy can be used to define different parameters of mitochondrial morphology. By using the Mitotracker Green FM dye mitochondrial structures are visualized independent of their respective MMP (Figure 2). This is important to ensure the inclusion of all mitochondrial structures present into the analyses. Using ImageJ Software, the morphology is analyzed on the basis of binary figures, as only here mitochondrial morphology parameters can be assessed (Figure 2, \"binary\"). Examples for mitochondrial morphology analyses in terms of form factor as well as aspect ratio were recently published 6, 13. Another important feature that can be measured in living human fibroblasts is the degradation of mitochondrial structures. The first step in this progress can be assessed by mitochondrio-lysosomal colocalization in live cell imaging microscopy. Certain pathological conditions result in an increased colocalization of mitochondria with lysosomes (Figure 3A). Again, Mitotracker Green FM is used to stain mitochondrial structures independent of their respective MMP. In addition, staining with Lysotracker Red DND-99 allows visualizing lysosomal structures. It is critical that the Lysotracker Red dye is present during the imaging process, as washing steps reduce the signal that becomes too low for visualization. Colocalization is represented by clear yellow fluorescence signals due to the overlap of the green (Mitotracker Green FM) and red (Lysotracker Red DND-99) staining (white arrows, Figure 3A) and are determined by calculation of the Pearson coefficient (Figure 3B).\nIn general, for off-line analyses with ImageJ software, it is helpful to visualize one cell per image, so that the definition of a specific region of interest (ROI) can be avoided.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4228/4228fig1.jpg",
