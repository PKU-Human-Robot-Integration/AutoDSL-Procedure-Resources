  "procedures": [
    "All procedures including animal subjects were performed in accordance with the regulations of the German Federal Law, the respective EU regulations and NIH guidelines, and have been approved by the ethics committee of the Landesverwaltungsamt Sachsen/Anhalt (42502-2-1102 IfN).\n1. Auditory Learning\nAuditory discrimination learning in the shuttle box (FMTD paradigm) Note: Always wear gloves while handling the mice.\n\t\nHouse C57Bl6/J mice in groups of three or four with free access to food pellets and tap water in clear polycarbonate cages. Maintain a 12 hr light:dark cycle in the animal facility. If animals are received from another lab or from a company allow at least one week of acclimation and settling in.\nPerform one shuttle box training session per day.\n\t\t\nTake the mouse from its home cage in the animal facility and place it in a dimly lit shuttle box within a sound proof chamber.\nUse a fully computer-controlled learning schedule for auditory discrimination learning. Begin with a habituation period of 3 min of silence, and then start the training session.\n\t\t\t\nUse sequences of the rising tone (4 - 8 kHz, CS+) as the Go-stimulus during Go-trials: The animal has to cross the hurdle within 6 sec of tone presentation (correct response, hit). Punish a miss by a mild foot-shock of 50 - 300 µA, delivered via the grid floor of the shuttle box.\nUse sequences of the falling tone (8 - 4 kHz, CS-) as the No-Go-stimulus during No-Go-trials: The animal has to remain in the current compartment of the shuttle box during the 6 sec of tone presentation. Punish a false alarm by a mild foot-shock of 50 - 300 µA, delivered via the grid floor of the shuttle box.\nUse intertrial intervals of 20 5 sec.",
    "Perform 30 Go-trials and 30 No-Go-trials per session in a pseudo-randomized order, so that one session consists of 60 trials and lasts about 25 min.\nPut the trained animal back into its home cage in the animal facility.\nBrain dissection\nEuthanize the animal at the desired time point after a desired number of training sessions using cervical dislocation (e.g. 24 hr after completion of the first session). Decapitate the animal.\nQuickly dissect the brain via the following steps: Cut first the skin and then the skull with straight scissors along the Sutura sagittalis. Completely remove the parts of the bone which cover the brain tissue using strong forceps. Take out the brain with a spattle.\nFor dissection, place brain onto a Petri dish filled with ice. Dissect the auditory cortex, the frontal cortex, the striatum and the hippocampus under a stereomicroscope using a scalpel and a needle.\n\t\t\nLocalize the auditory cortex using visual landmarks on the brain surface such as blood vessels and the shape of the surface (Bregma -2.06 to -3.4, size rostrocaudal 2 mm, dorsoventral 1.3 mm) and bilaterally dissect as a rectangular tissue block with the thickness of the cortex.\nDissect the frontal cortex as a brain slice between Bregma 3.56 and 1.54 using the chiasma opticum as a landmark and excluding tissue from bulbus olfactorius.\nDissect the striatum as a brain slice between Bregma 1.54 and 0.5 and carefully remove cortical tissue.\nDissect the hippocampus by fixing the brain with the needle through the cerebellum and uncoiling the cortex starting at the occipital lobe.\nShock-freeze dissected brain samples in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C.\n2. Preparation of Synaptosomes or Alternatively a Postsynaptic-density (PSD)-enriched Fraction",
    "NOTE: During all procedures, keep samples and buffers at 0 - 4 °C. Buffers contain freshly diluted protease inhibitor cocktails in order to prevent proteolytic degradation of proteins. If protein phosphorylation is also studied, phosphatase inhibitor cocktails have to be added. All g-values indicated are given as g (average) throughout the whole protocol.\nPreparation of a crude membrane fraction (Figure 3A)\nTransfer dissected brain tissue into a homogenization vessel containing 1 ml ice cold buffer A (5 mM HEPES, 320 mM sucrose, pH 7.4) and homogenize tissue at 900 rpm with 12 strokes.\nCentrifuge samples at 1,000 x g for 10 min. Keep the supernatants.\nRe-homogenize pellets at the same conditions in the same volume of homogenization buffer as before and centrifuge samples again at 1,000 x g for 10 min. Combine corresponding supernatants. Discard the pellets P1, which mainly contain nuclei and cell debris.\nSpin the combined supernatants for 20 min at 12,000 x g. Discard supernatants or use for further fractionation11.\nResuspend pellets in the same volume of homogenization buffer as before using the homogenizer with 6 strokes at 900 rpm and spin at 12,000 x g for 20 min. Discard supernatants. The pellets P2 represent the crude membrane fractions.\nPurification of synaptosomes from crude brain membrane fractions (Figure 3A)\n\tNOTE: Crude brain membrane fractions can be separated into myelin, light membranes, synaptosomes and mitochondria using sucrose density step gradient ultracentrifugation. For this 5 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.1 buffers containing sucrose at either 0.32 M, 1.0 M or 1.2 M concentration are required.\n\t\nWhile performing the centrifugation to produce the P2 fractions, prepare sucrose step gradients in the ultracentrifuge tubes. Start with 2.5 ml 1.0 M sucrose buffer and sublayer with 1.5 ml 1.2 M sucrose buffer using a glass Pasteur pipet.",
    "Re-homogenize P2 fractions in 0.5 ml of 0.32 M sucrose buffer manually with 6 strokes and load on top of the gradient.\nSpin at 85,000 x g for 2 hr in an ultracentrifuge using a swinging bucket rotor.\nDiscard the top 0.32 M sucrose layer including the material at the interface to the 1.0 M sucrose buffer (myelin, light membranes). Collect synaptosomes at the 1.0/1.2 M sucrose buffer interface. The pellet at the bottom of the tube contains mitochondria.\nAdd 0.32 M sucrose buffer to the synaptosomal fraction at 1:1 ratio, mix carefully and spin at 150,000 x g for 1 hr. Synaptosomes are in the pellet and can now be resuspended in a buffer required for further processing.\nPreparation of a PSD-enriched fraction (Figure 3B)\nHomogenize each specific brain area from a single animal in 100 µl extraction buffer (5 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.1, 0.5% Triton X-100) in a 200 µl ultracentrifuge tube with a PTFE (polytetrafluorethylene) pestle at 2,000 rpm with 12 strokes.\nAdd 100 µL extraction buffer, mix and incubate for 1 hr at 4 °C. Spin down at 100,000 x g for 1 hr and collect the supernatant S1 carefully with a 200 µl pipet.\nRe-homogenize pellet P1 in the same tube with 100 µl extraction buffer again with a PTFE pestle at 2,000 rpm with 12 strokes.\nAdd 100 µl extraction buffer and mix well with a pipette and spin at 100,000 x g for 1 hr.\nCombine the supernatant S2 with S1 to the soluble protein fraction. This fraction contains cytosolic proteins, 0.5% Triton X-100 soluble membrane proteins and extracellular matrix molecules.",
    "Resuspend the remaining pellet in 50 µl 5 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.1. This fraction contains PSDs, detergent-resistant membranes, insoluble cytoskeletal elements, mitochondria and cell debris including nuclei. It is enriched in PSDs which form the core of postsynaptic structures but also important parts of the presynaptic cytomatrix at the active zone. The factor for enrichment of PSDs is around 4 and the enrichment of PSD components has been demonstrated previously.12\n3. Sample Preparation for Mass Spectrometry\nLysis and sample normalization\n\tNOTE: Sample normalization concerning the protein concentration is a very crucial step to finally achieve reliable quantitative data even for weak synaptic protein expression changes.\n\t\nDissolve synaptosomes or PSD-enriched preparations of each brain area of an animal in 20 - 50 µl (dependent on total amount of material: for auditory cortex with 5 - 15 mg tissue use 20 µl) of 8 M urea and incubate on ice for 1 hr in an ultrasonic bath.\n\t\t\nFor in-gel digest, dissolve synaptosomes directly in the SDS-sample buffer. Carefully calculate the loaded amount to avoid overload of the gel. Consider that in this case, the high abundant scaffold proteins will be lost during the gel electrophoresis and in-gel digest.\nDilute with 1% of a removable detergent to ensure a final concentration of 2 M urea. Avoid any temperature higher than 30 °C to prevent protein carbamylation.\nPerform SDS-PAGE with an aliquot (e.g. 10 µl) of the sample according to standard procedures13,14.\nStain the gel with Coomassie Blue according to manufacturer's protocol. The procedure combines the fixing and staining step with methanol and acetic acid.\nDetermine the optical density of each sample for the whole lane with a calibrated gel scanner in transmission mode and calculate the relative protein amount.\nNormalize the samples according to these calculations.",
    "Split each sample into two different parts. Use one third for the in-gel digest and two thirds for the in-solution digest.\nIn-gel digest\nGel separation\nPerform a second SDS-PAGE utilizing the concentration-adjusted samples. Stain and quantify the gels for a second time to check the normalization quality.\nCut out each lane of a sample within the gel in different areas (8/lane) but exclude the molecular weight range above 170 kDa. Transfer the gel pieces into separate tubes.\nCut the areas in smaller pieces (approx. 1 x 1 mm) with a sharp scalpel to facilitate in-gel digestion efficacy.\nDigest15\nWash the gel pieces several times (depending on staining intensity) for 10 min with 50 - 150 µl of a buffer consisting of 50% acetonitrile (ACN) and 50 mM ammonium hydrogen carbonate (NH4HCO3).\nRemove supernatants. Cover the gel pieces with ACN and incubate at 20 °C until gel pieces become white and shrink.\nRemove the ACN and rehydrate the gel pieces for 5 min with 50 µl of 0.1 M NH4HCO3. Add the same volume of ACN and incubate for further 15 min at 37 °C.\nRemove and discard liquid completely. Dry the gel pieces in a vacuum centrifuge.\nRehydrate gel pieces in 50 µl of NH4HCO3 containing 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and heat samples for 45 min at 56 °C to reduce cysteine residues.\nRemove supernatants and add 50 µl NH4HCO3 containing 55 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) for 30 min in the dark to carbamidomethylate reduced cysteines.\nRemove and discard all liquid above the gel pieces and wash them twice with 50 µl NH4HCO3 and ACN (1:1) for 10 min to remove any residual IAA. Dry samples in a vacuum centrifuge.",
    "For limited digestion of proteins add 25 mM NH4HCO3 containing 12.5 ng/µl of trypsin. The required volume depends on size and amount of the gel pieces. Incubate for a few minutes and check if the buffer is absorbed. Add more buffer if necessary, gel pieces should be completely covered. Incubate at 37 °C overnight (min. 12 hr).\nPeptide extraction\nOverlay gel pieces with 10 - 20 µl of 25 mM NH4HCO3 and add the same volume of ACN. Incubate for 10 min on ice using ultrasonic bath. Afterwards remove and collect supernatants which contain most of the generated peptides.\nAdd 100 µl of extraction buffer containing 30% ACN/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to the gel pieces. Repeat incubation in an ultrasonic bath and carefully collect this supernatant.\nRepeat the last extraction steps by increasing the ACN concentration to 50%. After 10 min of ultrasonic bath spin down and collect supernatants.\nCombine all three corresponding supernatants of the extraction steps and dry them in a vacuum centrifuge. Note that as a result of the gel separation the 8 areas per lane/sample are combined to one sample again in this step.\nIn-solution digest\nDigest\nUse the calculated amount (e.g. 100 µl of a 150 µl lysate, depends on the amount of material and the volume required for resuspension of a sample from a specific brain area) of normalized samples to obtain sufficient starting material for at least three technical replicates to perform label-free mass spectrometry.\nAdd 2 mM DTT in 25 mM NH4HCO3 and gently vortex the sample. Reduce the samples for 45 min at 20 °C.\nAdd 10 mM IAA to carbamidomethylate the cysteine residues. Mix and incubate for 30 min in the dark at 20 °C.",
    "Finally, add 1 µl of a trypsin stock solution (1 µg/µl trypsin in 25 mM acetic acid) and incubate at 20 °C for 12 hr.\nSolid-phase extraction (SPE)-Purification\nTo remove the acid cleavable detergent, adjust samples to a final concentration of 1% TFA and incubate for 1 hr at 20 °C.\nCentrifuge samples at 16,000 x g for 10 min and carefully collect supernatants.\nPlace the SPE column in a rack and equilibrate the matrix with 2 ml methanol. Wash two times with 2 ml of 0.1% TFA in water (buffer B).\nAdd 2 ml of buffer B and load the sample. Wash another three times.\nElute the peptides by adding 200 µl 70% ACN/0.1% TFA. Repeat this step.\nPool both eluates and dry them down in a vacuum centrifuge.\nPhospho-peptide-enrichment by TiO 2 chromatography16\nDissolve peptides produced by in-gel or in-solution digest in 150 µl of 80% ACN/2.5% TFA (buffer C) and equilibrate ~ 2 mg of the TiO2 beads in 50 µl of buffer C.\nAdd beads to the sample and incubate in a rotating device for 1 hr at 20 °C. Afterwards, spin beads down (16,000 x g, 1 min) and collect supernatants.\nWash the beads three times with 100 µl of buffer C by gently mixing and spinning down after 5 min. Collect supernatants. Repeat this step three times with 100 µl of 80% ACN/0.1% TFA followed by three washes with 100 µl of 0.1% TFA (without ACN), respectively.\nCombine all ten supernatants, dry them in a vacuum centrifuge and handle them as the phospho-peptide-depleted fraction for further purification according step 3.5.\nElute the bound phospho-peptides with 20 µl of 400 mM NH4OH/30% ACN from the beads. Repeat this step three times and collect all supernatants after spinning down the beads.",
    "Combine the eluates of the in-gel digest and of the in-solution digest of a sample and handle them as the phospho-peptide-enriched fraction. Dry them in a vacuum centrifuge to a final volume of 4 - 8 µl.\nConcentrating and desalting of phospho-peptide-depleted fractions by micro-SPE\nDissolve the dried peptides in 20 µl of 0.1% TFA.\nEquilibrate the fixed C18-matrix by drawing 20 µl ACN into the tip. Wash the matrix by drawing 0.1% TFA in water into the tip. Repeat the process three times.\nSlowly load acidified sample into the tip (repeat this step three times).\nWash the C18-matrix three times with 20 µl 0.1% TFA in water and discard the washing solution.\nElute peptides from the pipette tip by repeatedly (3 times) drawing 20 µl of 70% ACN/0.1% TFA and collect this elution solution in a separate tube.\nCombine the eluates of a sample and dry them in a vacuum centrifuge.\n4. Proteome Analysis\nNOTE: Proteome analysis is performed on a hybrid dual-pressure linear ion trap/orbitrap mass spectrometer equipped with an ultra HPLC. The HPLC is composed of a cooled autosampler with a 20 µl injection loop, a binary loading pump (µl flow range), a binary nano flow separation pump, a column heater with two micro switching valves and a degasser. Samples are firstly subjected to a trapping column (e.g. 100 µm x 2 cm) at a flow rate of 7 µl/min followed by separation on a column (e.g. 75 µm x 25 cm) at 250 nl/min. The separation column outlet is directly coupled to a coated Pico emitter tip positioned in a nano-spray interface at the mass spectrometer ionization source.\nNano-liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry",
    "Dissolve peptide samples in 12 µl 2% ACN/0.1% TFA for at least 30 min. Spin down for 15 sec and transfer 11 µl supernatant to autosampler vials (conical, reduced diameter).\nSet up an automated regime for sample application, chromatographic separation and tandem mass spectrometry at controlling software (e.g., Xcalibur) as follows.\n\t\t\nUse the following for Temperature: Autosampler: 5 °C; Column oven: 45 °C.\nUse the following for Injection: Volume: 10 µl; Flow rate: 7 µl/min (2% ACN, 0.1% TFA); Time: 8 min; Valve setting: trap column - waste; mass spec acquisition: off.\nUse the following for Separation: Flow rate: 250 nl/min Valve setting: trap column-separation column; mass spec acquisition: on.\n\t\t\t0 min - 100 min: 2% ACN, 0.1% formic acid - 40% ACN, 0.1% formic acid\n\t\t\t100 min - 105 min: 40% ACN, 0.1% formic acid - 95% ACN, 0.1% formic acid\n\t\t\t105 min - 109 min: 95% ACN, 0.1% formic acid\n\t\t\t109 min - 120 min: 2% ACN, 0.1% formic acid\nUse the following for mass spectrometry settings: Full MS: FTMS; resolution 60,000; m/z range 400 - 2,000; MS/MS: Linear Iontrap; minimum signal threshold 500; isolation width 2 Da; dynamic exclusion time setting 30 sec; singly-charged ions are excluded from selection; normalized collision energy is set to 35%, and activation time to 10 msec.\n\t\t\tNOTE: A full MS scan is followed by up to 15 LTQ MS/MS runs using collision-induced-dissociation (CID) of the most abundantly detected peptide ions.\nRun three technical replicates for all samples.\nProtein identification and label free quantification",
    "Process mass spectrometric raw data towards protein identification and label-free quantification utilizing a commercial software suite (e.g., PEAKS Studio). In contrast to most other proteome software packages this particular software uses a de novo-sequencing algorithm prior to protein database alignments. However, this step can be easily substituted by other popular software packages.\nUse essential settings listed in Table 2.\nPhospho-proteomics\n\tNOTE: Efficient and reliable phospho-peptide acquisition requires a few essential changes of the proteomic workflow setup.\n\t\nAfter phospho-peptide enrichment, never dry samples completely. Always keep samples dissolved.\n\t\tNOTE: The phospho-ester bond of phosphorylated threonines or serines is very fragile. During collision-induced fragmentation within the ion trap this results in a neutral loss of phosphate. This prevents any further fragmentation of the peptide, which in turn is required for identification. Permitted wideband-activation in the mass spectrometry setup allows the fragmentation of phospho-peptides even after a neutral loss of the phosphate group. It performs a time saving \"pseudo-MS3\". Phospho-site determination in MS/MS data requires a particular verification and evaluation and can be performed by phosphoRS 3.0.\n5. Bioinformatics - Meta-Analysis\nNOTE: Before performing functional annotation and network analysis, the protein lists have to be preprocessed. First merge the lists of regulated proteins and phospho-peptides for each brain region separately. Then remove all duplicate UniProt-IDs for each fraction to prevent misinterpretation.\nSingular enrichment analysis with GeneCodis 17\nOpen the web-based tool of GeneCodis (http://genecodis.cnb.csic.es)\nSelect \"Mus musculus\" as organism and \"GO Biological Process\" as annotation.\nPaste a list of UniProt-IDs of a certain fraction. Submit and wait until the analysis is performed. Click on \"Singular Enrichment Analysis of GO Biological Process\" and view results.\nRepeat step 5.1.3 for the other three fractions.",
    "To see any duplications and intersections between the result lists use a scripting language like Perl or Python to filter the data needed. Similar tools for a singular enrichment analysis are DAVID (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) and Cytoscape (http://www.cytoscape.org/) with the PlugIns BiNGO (http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/bingo) and ClueGO (http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/cluego).\nGenerating a force based graph out of GeneCodis data with Gephi (https://gephi.org/)\n\tNOTE: The data for the graphs has to be provided by the user, either in a graph format (.gexf, .graphml, .dot, .gv, .gml) or entered by hand.\n\t\nGenerating the graph nodes\n\t\t\nBy hand: Open Gephi and click on \"Data Laboratory\".
