    "Designing the sgRNA is the first critical step for successful gene targeting and is based on important reference steps developed and described in the past several years. An efficient sgRNA should lead to high levels of on-target Cas9 cleavage with minimal off-target effects. Design and optimization of PCR primers for genotyping is the second essential step to avoid downstream problems, and this is also described below.\nMaterials\nPublicly available genome browsers: Ensembl (https://useast.ensembl.org/index.html[href=https://useast.ensembl.org/index.html]), UCSC Genome Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/[href=https://genome.ucsc.edu/])\nDepMap portal (https://depmap.org/portal/[href=https://depmap.org/portal/])\nsgRNA design tools: Benchling (https://www.benchling.com/[href=https://www.benchling.com/]), Synthego CRISPR Design Tool (https://design.synthego.com/#/[href=https://design.synthego.com/#/]), Invitrogen TrueDesign Genome Editor (https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/genome-editing/geneart-crispr/invitrogen-truedesign-genome-editor.html[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/genome-editing/geneart-crispr/invitrogen-truedesign-genome-editor.html])\nPrimer designer tools: NCBI Primer-BLAST (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/[href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/]), Primer3 Input (https://primer3.ut.ee/[href=https://primer3.ut.ee/]), or other available software\nAdditional reagents and equipment for PCR (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-prot-0002]) and agarose gel electrophoresis\nIdentify sgRNA targeting sequence\n1. Before starting the design of a target-specific sgRNA, it is necessary to locate the region of interest (Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-fig-0001]). Use a publicly available genome browser such as Ensembl or UCSC Genome Browser to determine exon/intron regions and search for the target region.\nIn this example, we targeted the Homo sapiens (GRCh38.p10) chr15:80,470,411 region in ARNT2 exon 4, where the c.388C>G variant is located.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a5f55044-381e-44a4-a39d-24a894731788/cpz1519-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1",

(A) Representation of the localization of the region of interest and the designed sgRNAs. The c.388C>G variant occurs in the chr15:80,470,411 region in exon 4 of ARNT2. (B) Testing of sgRNA efficiency for all guides (three singular electroporation experiments) and donor DNA design after choosing the most efficient sgRNA. The selected sgRNA2 and the respective donor DNA (with killed PAM) are shown. (C) Targeted gene-editing is achieved by repeating the electroporation with donor DNA added. Cells are collected for single-cell seeding 48-72 hr after electroporation. In parallel, a portion of electroporated cells is used to assess the efficiency of cleavage and knock-in by ICE analysis. (D) Colonies are picked and transferred to a 96-well plate, which is then split to two plates: one for genotyping and one for freezing. After genotyping, the clones in which editing has been confirmed are expanded. (E) Sanger sequencing is used to confirm the corrected clone (CUIMCi003-A-1) and killed PAM. (F) Post-editing characterization includes karyotyping, assessment of stemness marker expression by immunocytochemistry, verification of potential for differentiation of three lineages, and mycoplasma testing.\n2. It is very important to predict how essential the targeted gene is for cell survival, and thus whether and how the editing (knock-out/mutation) could be lethal to the target cells. Search for the gene of interest on DepMap and check the dependency score.\nA highly negative dependency score indicates that cell survival is highly dependent on that gene, and therefore editing could be problematic. If the gene is essential, an inducible system should be considered.\n3. Select an sgRNA design web tool such as CRISPR Design Tool, Benchling, or Invitrogen TrueDesign Genome Editor.",
    "To design an sgRNA for knocking out a specific region, CRISPR Design Tool and Invitrogen TrueDesign Genome Editor are preferred.\n4. For CRISPR Design Tool, go to the website, select the species, and enter the name of the gene of interest.\nOnline tools such as Benchling and TrueDesign Genome Editor also allow pasting of the sequence of interest in FASTA format.\n5. Select the exon of interest and analyze the resulting recommended sgRNAs (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-fig-0002]).\n         \nChoose sgRNAs located within 20 bp of the target site if the target is a single-nucleotide/few-base-pair modification.\nSuitable sgRNAs should be 20 bp in length and located immediately next to the 5′ end of the PAM (Montague, Cruz, Gagnon, Church, & Valen, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-bib-0013]).",
    "Since the efficacy of sgRNAs varies considerably, it is recommended to select two or three sgRNAs per site of interest based on low off-target and high on-target activity scores (Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-tbl-0001]). Good and bad on-target (or cutting) scores are relative to the target region. Some target regions yield very efficient sgRNAs with a cutting efficiency of 0.8, which is considered high. Others yield sgRNAs with a cutting efficiency of only 0.5, which is considered low. Choose the highest score available at the target region. The off-target score is another parameter to decide which sgRNA is better: a low off-target score in combination with the highest cutting efficiency score will be the best sgRNA. The output from the CRISPR design tool is a list of potential off-target sites. For example, for ARNT2_g RNA2 the off-target score is 0,0,0,0,8, which indicates 0 identical mismatches, 0 sequences with a single mismatch, 0 sequences with two mismatches, 0 sequences with three mismatches, and 8 sequences with four mismatches. It is generally recommended to select guides that have 0 identical matches, 0 single mismatches, and at least 2 mismatches.\nCheck that the sgRNA sequence does not match any other region on the target genome. No mismatch is tolerated in the seed sequence (10-12 bp proximal region from the PAM proximity region). One or two mismatches are tolerated in the non-seed region (10 bp from the 5′ terminus) (Zhang et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-bib-0024]).\nTo improve target specificity and binding, try to avoid regions with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These can be determined by Sanger sequencing of the target region.\nThe websites ClinVar (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/[href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/]), dbSNP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/[href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/]), and Ensembl (https://useast.ensembl.org/index.html[href=https://useast.ensembl.org/index.html]) can also be used to identify SNPs.",
    "To select the best sgRNA, it is strongly recommended to perform an efficiency test for all selected sgRNAs (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-prot-0002] for ICE analysis).\nConsider the flexibility of the PAM sequence. To avoid sgRNA re-targeting, it is important to silence (or “kill”) the PAM sequence. For this reason, one of the criteria to consider when designing sgRNAs is the possibility of introducing a synonymous variant in the PAM region (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-fig-0001]; see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-prot-0003]).\nsgRNA synthesis is commercially available via providers like Synthego and IDT; sgRNA can also be cloned into the appropriate vectors or generated using in vitro transcription. Multiple gRNAs were available for our target sequence, but we selected these three gRNAs (represented in Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-tbl-0001]) because of both their high on-target and low off-target score. These three gRNAs were all tested according to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-prot-0002].\nTable 1.\n                sgRNA Sequences Designed Using the Synthego CRISPR Design Tool for the Project Reported Here\ntable:\n﻿Name,Strand,Sequence (5′ to 3′),Cut site,Exon,On-target score,Off-target score\nARNT2_g RNA1,+,ACAGGGAACAAGTCCACCGA,80470395,4,0.64,477\nARNT2_g RNA2,–,AGCCTTGTACGCGCCATCGG,80470397,4,0.608,8\nARNT2_g RNA3,–,GGAAGCCTTGTACGCGCCAT,80470400,4,0.537,221\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/358a1a46-eb54-47a4-af64-d29721bd3b7d/cpz1519-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nsgRNA design using the Synthego CRISPR Design Tool.

Design three sets of primers for each target site using the publicly available Primer-BLAST, Primer3 Input, or other available software.",
    "7. Prefer primers that bind at least 100-200 bp away from the PAM site in each direction.\nThis helps generate clean and readable sequences during genotyping screening. The primers designed for our example are shown in Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-tbl-0002].\nTable 2.\n                Genotyping Primers for ARNT2\ntable:\n﻿Primer,Sequence,Tm\nARNT2_F1,5′- GGTGTTAGCCCCTAGTTCCTGG -3′,62.07\nARNT2_R1,3′- TGGCTTCATTCCTTCCTCAACC -5′,60.56\nARNT2_F2,5′- CCCCTCTCCTGATCTCGTGC -3′,61.74\nARNT2_R2,3′- TTGGTGACGCTGGGATTCC -5′,60.0\nARNT2_F3,5′- GCCAGACAAGCTCACCATCC -3′,61.03\nARNT2_R3,3′- CCTTGAGCCCTGGTTCCCC -5′,62.29\n8. As DNA template, use DNA isolated from the cells that will be edited. For PCR conditions, see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-prot-0002], steps 27-28.\n9. Optimize the PCR reaction by using a combination of these primers and at least three different annealing temperatures.\nWe tested the three combinations (F1R1, 443 bp; F2R2, 300 bp; F3R3, 203 bp) at three annealing temperatures (Fig. S1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#support-information-section]).\n10. Determine the best primer set by running the PCR product on a 1.5% to 2% agarose gel.\nWe chose ARNT2_F1R1 as the best primer set because of the specificity of the amplification (no nonspecific bands were observed) at the annealing temperature of 62°C and the optimal length of the PCR product obtained (443 bp) for ICE analysis (Fig. S1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#support-information-section]). For Sanger sequencing, we chose ARNT2_F2 because it is optimally distanced from the target site and works as an internal primer.",
    "To assess the efficiency of the sgRNAs selected in Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-tbl-0001], a simple gene-targeting experiment (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-fig-0001]) was undertaken in the CUIMCi003-A iPSC line (Iannello et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-bib-0004]), using the Inference of CRISPR Edits (ICE) online tool from Synthego.

Select a hESC or hiPSC line that has been confirmed to have a normal karyotype. Grow in feeder-free conditions on Matrigel-coated 6-well culture plates using mTeSR Plus medium.\nWe previously used mTeSR1 medium, but it must be changed every day, whereas mTeSR Plus is changed every other day. We have also been using Cultrex-coated plates instead of Matrigel. Throughout these protocols, Matrigel can be replaced with Cultrex.\nWe try to split cells on Thursday, then change medium on Friday, adding 4 ml mTeSR Plus per well of a 6-well plate. Medium is changed again on Monday and Wednesday at 2 ml/well.\n2. Passage cells non-enzymatically using 0.5 mM EDTA before they reach 100% confluency.\n         \nCoat one (or more, if needed) 6-well plate with Matrigel. Leave for 1 hr at room temperature.\nBetter transfection efficiency is observed when cells are passaged the day before electroporation to reach 50%-60% confluency on the day of electroporation. Prior optimization of the splitting density may be required. Only 2 × 105 cells are required per sgRNA to be tested, so one well of a 6-well plate may be enough.\nWarm 2 ml of 0.5 mM EDTA for each well at 37°C.\nOnly the required amount should be warmed before the experiment.",
    "Aspirate medium from the cells and rinse cells by adding 1 ml of 0.5 mM prewarmed EDTA.\nAspirate rinse, replace with another 1 ml of 0.5 mM EDTA/well, and incubate at room temperature for 2-3 min and/or check cells under a microscope.\nColonies start loosening after ∼2 min, and cells start to round up and separate from each other. Some iPSC lines may require more time than others. Cells should not detach from the surface of the plate.\nCarefully aspirate EDTA and collect cells by gentle pipetting with 1 ml mTeSR Plus medium with 10 μM Y-27362.\nIf the cells have detached from the surface (which happens very rarely), collect them in 0.5 mM EDTA, centrifuge (5 min at 300 × g), aspirate the supernatant, and resuspend the pellet in 1 ml mTeSR Plus with 10 μM Y-27362.\nSplit cells 1:10 or at the best ratio for your cell line.\nAspirate Matrigel from the coated plate and immediately transfer cells to the coated plate in mTeSR Plus medium with 10 μM Y-27362.\nElectroporate cells\n3. Prepare a Matrigel-coated 24-well plate and incubate 1 hr at room temperature.\n4. Prepare an electroporation reaction mix as follows (21.5 μl per sgRNA to be tested):\n         \n16 μl P3 primary cell buffer\n4 μl Supplement 1\n1 μl (5 μg) sgRNA\n0.5 μl (5 μg) Cas9\nIncubate the mix 20-25 min at room temperature.\nTo test all three sgRNAs in Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-tbl-0001], we prepared enough cells and reagents for three reactions. An additional well of non-electroporated cells is needed for a positive control for PCR and ICE analysis.\n5. While the mix is incubating, warm Accutase to room temperature and detach the cells. Aspirate medium from the cells, add 1 ml Accutase per well, and wait 1-2 min and/or check cells under the microscope.",
    "6. Once the cells start detaching from the surface, add 1 ml of 1× DPBS without calcium and magnesium to block the enzyme.\n7. Pipette gently to make a single-cell suspension, breaking up any clumps.\n8. Count cells by trypan blue exclusion using a hemocytometer or other cell counter.\n9. Collect 2 × 105 cells per reaction in a 15-ml tube and bring to 10 ml using 1× DPBS without calcium and magnesium.\n10. Centrifuge 5 min at 300 × g. Aspirate supernatant, being careful not to disturb the small pellet.\n11. Gently resuspend pellet with electroporation mix, being careful to avoid bubbles, and transfer each reaction to a separate well of an electroporation strip.\n12. Electroporate using program CA137 or CB150 on a Lonza 4D-Nucleofector Core Unit.\nProgram CB150 is suggested by Lonza to electroporate hESCs (H9/WA09). For some lines, we and others have observed that program CA137 gives a better balance of survival and transfection efficiency. We suggest testing both programs when a new iPSC line is used for gene editing. For CUIMCi003-A, we used CA137. If an instrument other than the Lonza 4D is used, or if a transfection reagent is used, check the manufacturer's instructions as well as the literature for the best conditions for transfecting iPSCs.\n13. Immediately add 50 µl mTeSR Plus with 10% CloneR to the electroporated cells.\nWe have observed increased cell survival, especially of single cells, and better cloning efficiency when CloneR medium is used instead of Y-27362. We use Y-27362 for routine cell maintenance and CloneR for gene editing applications.\n14. Aspirate Matrigel from one well of the coated 24-well plate and immediately transfer electroporated cells to that well.\n15. Add another 250 µl mTeSR Plus with 10% CloneR to the well.\n16. Repeat for each electroporation reaction.",
    "17. Place plate in a 37°C incubator at 5% oxygen, 5% CO2 (hypoxic) or 21% oxygen, 5% CO2 (standard). Let cells recover and grow for 48-72 hr.\nLess cell death is observed when cells are kept in hypoxic conditions.\n18. On the following day (one day post-electroporation), check cell viability under the microscope, then add another 250 µl mTeSR Plus with 10% CloneR to each well.\nPerform PCR amplification and sequencing\n19. At 2-3 days post-electroporation, aspirate medium and detach cells using Accutase (steps 5-6) using a 500-µl volume for both Accutase and DPBS.\n20. Collect cells and transfer to a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube.\n21. Centrifuge 5 min at 300 × g. Aspirate the supernatant.\nIf DNA extraction will not be performed immediately, the cell pellet can be stored at −20°C.\n22. Add 100-500 µl DNA lysis buffer to the cell pellet and mix well by pipetting.\nThe volume of lysis buffer may vary based on pellet size or cell number.\n23. Add proteinase K to a final concentration of 200 μg/ml and incubate 30 min at 56°C.\n24. Inactivate proteinase K by incubating 20 min at 96°C.\n25. Allow sample to cool to room temperature and measure the DNA concentration.\n26. Prepare serial dilutions of 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 in dH2O in 8-tube strips to determine the optimum dilution/concentration for PCR amplification (Fig. S1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#support-information-section]).\nWe do not determine the exact amount (ng) of DNA for each PCR reaction, but rather use the dilution that gives a more specific and cleaner PCR product. A minimum of 5-10 ng DNA is required.\n27. Prepare a PCR master mix as follows (10 μl per reaction):\n         \n5 μl PCR premix\n1 µl (10 ng) DNA template\n1 µl (0.5 μM) Primer F\n1 µl (0.5 μM) Primer R",
    "2 μl dH2O\nUse the primers previously identified by optimization (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-prot-0001]). We used primer set ARNT2_F1R1 (Fig. S1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#support-information-section]) with a PCR premix containing a high-fidelity DNA polymerase.\n28. Perform amplification using the following program:\nInitial denaturation: 95°C, 5 min\n35 cycles:\n         \ndenaturation: 98°C, 20 s\nannealing: 62°C, 20 s\nextension: 72°C, 30 s\nFinal extension: 72°C, 1 min\n29. Check the amplicon size by running 2 μl on a 1.5% to 2% agarose gel.\n30. Use the remaining 8 μl for Sanger sequencing.\nPurified or crude PCR products can be used for Sanger sequencing using an internal (sequencing) primer. The internal primer should be at least 100-200 bp away from the PAM/cut site. The sample consisting of the non-electroporated iPSCs should also be sequenced as a control. In our experiment, we used the internal primer ARNT2_F2 for Sanger sequencing.\nAssess editing efficiency by ICE analysis\n31. Analyze the electropherograms generated by Sanger sequencing for electroporated and non-electroporated cells using the ICE online tool.\n         \nAdd the recommended information on the webpage, including the 20-bp sgRNA sequence. Upload the trace files (i.e., electropherograms files generated by Sanger sequencing; Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-fig-0002]).\nInterpret the results.\nThe indel percentage is a general indicator of how efficiently a given sgRNA/Cas9 complex cuts under the transfection conditions tested. The same value is also reported in the contribution column (Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-fig-0002]).\nChoose the sgRNA with higher indel and knock-in scores.",
    "In our example, the three sgRNAs in Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-tbl-0001] were tested separately in electroporation experiments. ARNT2_gRNA2 was chosen because of its cutting efficiency of 0.6 (knock-out score, Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-fig-0002]) and better off-target score (Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-tbl-0001]) compared to the other two options (knock-out scores of 0.7 and 0.3 for ARNT2_gRNA1 and ARNT2_gRNA3, respectively). ARNT2_gRNA2 was also chosen because it spans the location of the region we wished to edit (c.388C>G). For a knock-out experiment where more than one sgRNA is used in the same reaction for electroporation, the electroporated cells can be used directly for clonal selection if ICE analysis reveals a knock-out score >10.",
    "Homology-directed repair acts in the presence of a single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) or donor DNA template to specifically modify the target region of the gene of interest (Lin, Staahl, Alla, & Doudna, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-bib-0010]). Depending on the type of editing (correction/introduction of a point mutation or sequence insertion), the design of a donor template might vary.\nMaterials\nModified donor ssODN (Integrated DNA Technologies)\nBenchling or other available software\n1. Design the ssODN as a complementary sequence to the sgRNA target strand (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-fig-0001]).\n2. Include a sequence of ∼40-50 bp on each side of the PAM sequence (the length of the homology arms can vary).\nAn 80- to 100-bp ssODN is recommended when introducing/correcting a single nucleotide mutation or when deleting/inserting a small fragment. To insert a larger fragment in the region of interest, the donor DNA template should include the sequence of interest flanked by homology arms (right and left) of ∼100 bp.\n3. The sgRNA could recognize the PAM sequence in the donor DNA template, leading to repetitive cleavage. To avoid this, introduce a single nucleotide change in the PAM sequence, maintaining the same reading frame (i.e., a killed PAM, Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-fig-0001]). This will avoid sgRNA re-targeting and increase editing efficiency.\nIn this example, we chose the sequence\nGGTACCTGCTCTGTGAGGAAGGAAGgCTTGTACGCGCCATCGGTcGACTTGTTCCCTGTACCCCTCATGGACTTCATGTG (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-fig-0001]).\nIf the synonymous modification in the PAM site is not possible, an alternative is to introduce a synonymous variant at the 3′ end of the sgRNA binding region in the ssODN.",
    "After optimizing the electroporation conditions and choosing the best sgRNA (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-prot-0002]), electroporation is repeated, adding donor DNA, if needed (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-prot-0003]; Fig. 1C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-fig-0001]). This electroporation requires more cells (0.5–1 × 106 per reaction) and more electroporation mix (100 μl per reaction). Upon genotyping, we use ICE analysis to determine the cleavage efficiency and the knock-in efficiency if a donor is used.\nAdditional materials (also see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-prot-0002])\nSingle-stranded modified donor DNA (ssODN; Integrated DNA Technologies)\n12-well flat-bottom cell culture plates (Corning, cat. no. 3513)\nP3 primary cell 4D-Nucleofector X kit L (Lonza, cat. no.

For a knock-out experiment, if donor DNA is being used, ICE analysis can be repeated at this point or one can proceed directly to single-cell seeding.",
    "ICE analysis will help predict the percentage of knock-in present in the electroporated cells. The number of colonies to pick for genotyping will be determined by ICE analysis results. The knock-in score represents the percentage of sequences in the sample that contains the desired alteration. The same value is also reported on the contribution column (Fig. 2C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-fig-0002]). The higher the knock-out or knock-in score, the fewer colonies need to be picked. In our case, ICE analysis showed a knock-in score of 23 (Fig. 2C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-fig-0002]).\n18. Proceed with low-density (single-cell) seeding and colony picking for genotyping if the knock-in score is >10.\nIt is possible to get an edited clone even when the knock-in score is below 10, but it may require screening of many more colonies.",

Seed ∼5 × 103 cells in 10 ml medium for a 10-cm dish or ∼1 × 103 cells in 2 ml medium per well of a 6-well plate.\nWe usually seed two 10-cm dishes, although one is generally enough to obtain enough colonies to seed a full 96-well plate.\n6. Place plate(s) in a 37°C incubator at 5% O2, 5% CO2 (hypoxic) or 21% O2, 5% CO2 (standard) and grow overnight.\n7. The next day, add 5 ml mTeSR Plus medium with 10% CloneR to a 10-cm plate or 1 ml medium per well of a 6-well plate.",
    "8. Allow cells to grow for ∼1 week or until there are ∼50-100 cells per colony. Change medium every other day.\nPick colonies\n9. Coat a 96-well plate with 50 µl Matrigel/well and leave for 1 hr.\nThe number of plates will depend on the ICE results and on how many colonies are picked. ICE analysis is a good reference tool to predict the potential number of clones with the alteration of interest, but, as a bioinformatic tool, it has some limitations. As a standard practice (and in this particular experiment), we pick a full 96-well plate for genotyping. In a knock-out editing experiment, for a score of 50, we suggest picking 20-30 colonies.\n10. At the same time, change the medium on the cells with fresh medium and leave for at least 1 hr.\n11. When ready to pick colonies, aspirate Matrigel from the 96-well plate and replace with 50 µl/well mTeSR Plus medium with 10% CloneR.\n12. Manually pick colonies using a microscope inside a biosafety cabinet or picking hood. Position the plate under the microscope to select a colony, then pick manually using a pipette and transfer to one well of the 96-well coated plate (Fig. 1D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-fig-0001]).\nWe usually use a P200 pipette with filtered tips. A fresh tip must be used for each colony.\n13. When all colonies have been picked, place the plate in the incubator and grow cells overnight.\n14. The next day, add another 100 µl mTeSR Plus medium with 10% CloneR to each well.\n15. Grow colonies for ∼1 week, changing the medium every other day.\nPerform genotyping and allele sequencing\n16. Check confluency under the microscope. When the colonies are ∼70% confluent (∼1 week), detach cells using 0.5 mM EDTA and split to two fresh Matrigel-coated 96-well culture plates (Fig. 1D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-fig-0001]).",

Allow cells to grow again to 70% confluency.\nOnce the cells reach 70% confluency, proceed to freezing the plate to be used as a backup (see Basic Protocol 6).\n18. For the plate to be genotyped, remove medium from each well using a multichannel aspirator or multichannel pipette, being sure to change tips after each row.\n19. Wash cells with 100 μl/well of 1× DPBS without calcium and magnesium. Aspirate DPBS.\nOnce washed, cells can be stored in the 96-well plate up to 24 hrs at −20°C, although it is strongly recommended to proceed immediately to DNA lysis.\n20. Add 100 µl DNA lysis buffer with 200 μg/ml proteinase K to each well and allow cells to lyse for 20 min at room temperature.\n21. Transfer lysates to a 96-well PCR plate using a multichannel pipettor and seal the plate with sealing film.\nCare must be taken to avoid any cross-well DNA contamination when transferring lysates, which are viscous and sticky.\n22. Incubate 1 hr at 56°C to lyse cells, and then 20 min at 95°C to inactivate the proteinase K.\n23. Measure DNA concentration from three to four wells using a spectrophotometer or Nanodrop and calculate the mean concentration from these wells.\n24. Use the multichannel pipettor to dilute the entire 96-well plate at the optimal dilution determined previously (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-prot-0002], steps 26-30). Change tips with each row and be careful to avoid cross-contamination.\n25. Perform PCR as described (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-prot-0002], steps 27-28).",
    "26. Check amplification and size of the PCR products by running 23 μl on a 1.5%-2% agarose gel. Use the remaining PCR product for genotyping/screening by Sanger sequencing or target-specific restriction enzyme digestion.\nElectropherograms from Sanger sequencing can be analyzed manually or by ICE analysis. We sequenced 48 of the 96 colonies we picked and found four that showed the desired correction, indicating successful editing.",

Add 100 µl freezing medium per well and mix cells by pipetting gently four to six times.\n5. Repeat for all rows of the plate.",
    "To avoid long exposure to the DMSO in the freezing medium, cells should be frozen in batches using two 96-well plates. Simply transfer the cells from half of the plate to a second Matrigel-coated plate and immediately transfer it to the –80°C freezer, then proceed with the remaining wells in a separate batch.\n6. Wrap the plate with Parafilm and cover with multiple layers of tissue paper.\n7. Place the plate in a Styrofoam box and transfer that to a –80°C freezer.\nPlacing the plate in a Styrofoam box applies gradual freezing, which prevents cold shock to the cells. We do not recommend storing 96-well plates in liquid nitrogen, as it can leak into the wells and damage the cells.\nThaw 96-well plate\n8. Remove the 96-well plate from the −80°C freezer. Remove the tissue paper and transfer plate (still sealed with Parafilm) to a 37°C water bath.

When more than half of the medium has thawed, move the plate to the biosafety cabinet.\n10. Clean the surface of the plate with 70% alcohol and then remove the Parafilm.\n11. Add 100 µl mTeSR Plus with 10% CloneR to each well.\n12. Centrifuge plate 5 min at 300 × g.\nCells should be deposited at the bottom of the wells.\n13.

    "In our case, two of the four positive clones did not survive freezing and thawing, and we proceeded with expansion of the remaining two clones.\nExpand desired clones\n17. After thawing, allow cells to grow for 2 days in hypoxic or standard incubator conditions. Check the wells with positive clones under a microscope every day to confirm viability.\n18. When the cells reach ∼70% confluency (2-3 days), detach cells for each positive clone using 0.5 mM EDTA (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-prot-0002], step 2) and split to one well of a Matrigel-coated 24-well plate using 300 μl/well mTeSR Plus medium with 10% CloneR.\n19. When cells reach confluency (2-3 days), split cells again to one well of a Matrigel-coated 12-well plate using 500 μl/well medium.\n20. When cells reach confluency (2-3 days), split once more to one well of a Matrigel-coated 6-well plate using 2 ml/well medium.\nAlternatively, expansion can be done directly from the 96-well plate to a 12-well plate and then a 6-well plate.\n21.

    "Upon generating and expanding an iPSC cell line with the desired editing, it is necessary to confirm that the cell line shows a normal karyotype, is pluripotent, and expresses stemness markers (Fig. 1F[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-fig-0001]). Pluripotency is assessed by differentiation using a commercial kit and immunostaining for the germ-layer-specific markers OTX2 (ectoderm), Brachyury (mesoderm), and SOX17 (endoderm).

Correction of the mutation was confirmed in the edited line.\nPerform karyotyping (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-fig-0003])\n2. Coat a T25 flask with Matrigel and leave for 1 hr at room temperature.\n3. Split cells and seed onto the coated flask (one T25 is equivalent to three wells of a 6-well plate).\n4. Let cells grow to 30%-40% confluency.",
    "5. Use a reputable service provider for karyotyping and request standard G-banding on at least 20 metaphases at 425-band resolution.\nWe use Columbia University Medical Center-Clinical Laboratory Services (New York City) or Cell Line Genetics (Madison, Wisconsin). When shipping live cells to an outside service provider, use a trustworthy delivery service like FedEx. Fill the flask with medium, wrap the lid with Parafilm, wrap the flask with bubble wrap, and ship at room temperature using priority overnight. It may be better to use feeder cells instead of Matrigel to guarantee cells remain attached during transportation. Avoid shipping when severe weather is forecast to avoid cold temperatures and delivery delays.\nCytogenetic analysis by Giemsa-banding, performed on CUIMCi003-A-1 at passage 18, confirmed a normal female karyotype (46, XX).\nAssess in vitro differentiation potential (Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-fig-0003])\n6. Assess germ layer differentiation potential using the Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Functional Identification kit according to manufacturer's instructions.\nLine CUIMCi003-A-1 at passage 29 was successfully differentiated in vitro into all three germ layers. The pluripotency of this line was confirmed by expression of ectoderm (OTX2), mesoderm (Brachyury), and endoderm (SOX17) markers from all three germ layers (Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-tbl-0003]).\nAssess stemness marker expression by immunostaining (Fig. 3C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-fig-0003])\n7. Fix the edited line with 4% PFA for 10 min at room temperature.\nWe performed immunostaining on CUIMCi003-A-1 at passage 29.\n8. Wash cells twice with 1× DPBS.\n9. Permeabilize cells with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature.\n10. Block cells in Protein Block for 30 min at room temperature.\n11. Stain with primary antibodies (Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-tbl-0003]) diluted in 1× DPBS containing 1% BSA overnight at 4°C.\n12. Wash twice with 1× PBS containing 1% BSA.",
    "13. If needed, incubate with secondary antibody (Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-tbl-0003]) in 1× DPBS containing 1% BSA for 1 hr at room temperature.\n14. Wash three times with 1× DPBS containing 1% BSA.\n15. Stain nuclei with DAPI and capture images using a fluorescence microscope.\nImmunostaining showed expression of stemness markers Oct 4, Nanog, and SOX2 in undifferentiated cells.\nTest for mycoplasma contamination (Fig. S2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#support-information-section])\n16. Test iPSCs for mycoplasma using a PCR-based kit according to manufacturer's instructions.\nOur mycoplasma test was performed at passage 30 and was negative.\nPerform off-target analysis\n17. Confirm integrity of off-target sequence(s) by amplification and Sanger sequencing of the top three predicted off-target candidates.\nThe gRNAs design software tools mentioned above automatically recommend guides with the highest chances of gene knock-out/knock-in and the lowest off-target effects. sgRNA length is also optimized; truncated sgRNAs with <20 base homology display less off-target activity (Fu, Sander, Reyon, Cascio, & Joung, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-bib-0002]). Because RNPs persist only briefly inside the cells, the chance of off-target editing is reduced (Kim et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-bib-0007]; Liang et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-bib-0009]). The top three to five predicted off-target candidates could also be predicted using the COSMID46 tool (https://crispr.bme.gatech.edu[href=https://crispr.bme.gatech.edu]) or the MIT CRISPR design tool (http://crispr.mit.edu[href=http://crispr.mit.edu]). The integrity of the off-target sequence(s) can be confirmed by amplification and Sanger sequencing of the top three predicted off-target candidates. We selected three sgRNAs for further testing based on the off-target scores in Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.519#cpz1519-tbl-0001], obtained using the Synthego CRISPR Design Tool. We did not perform specific off-target analysis in the positive clone."
