    "Site-directed mutagenesis of pLightswitch_Prom_BMX to mutate the putative HRE within in the BMX promoterPrimers are designed to mutate 2 base pairs (ACGTG → ATATG) within the HRE of the BMX promoter using the QuikChange Primer Design website (referenced above).The CG → TA bp change has been described in the literature to effectively disrupt the HRE.pLightSwitch_Prom_BMX is mutated using the QuikChangeXLSite-Directed Mutagenesis kit[href=https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/200516.pdf] per manufacturer’s protocol.Extension time: 4.5 minSubstitute DifcoTM Terrific Broth for NZY+ brothMutated plasmids are confirmed by sequencing using promoter insert sequencing primers (Forward: 5’-TCCATCAAAACAAAACGAAACAA-3’, Reverse: 5’-AGTCGAGCACGTTCATCTGCTT-3’) listed on the Switchgear Genomics website (http://switchgeargenomics.com/resources/vector-maps[href=http://switchgeargenomics.com/resources/vector-maps]).Hypoxia reporter assay (LightSwitch Dual Assay System Manual[href=https://www.activemotif.com/documents/1945.pdf])Day 1 (Carry out under a Laminar flow hood)Coat two white 96-well plates with 1x Poly-D-lysine (50 μl/well) for 2 h at room temperature.Plate enough wells per plate to carry out in triplicate.Example samples:Empty vector (pLightSwitch_Prom) + pTK-ClucWild-type Bmx promoter (pLightSwitch_Prom_BMX) + pTK-ClucHRE mutated BMX promoter (pLightSwitch_Prom_BMXmHRE) + pTK-Cluc Use one plate per condition (i.e., 2 plates for comparison normoxia to hypoxia).Wash the plates once with sterile H2O (200 μl/well); plate 5 x 103 HEK293 cells per well in 100 μl of growth media and cultured overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2.Day 2 Preparation of constructs and reagents Allow all reagents and plasmids to equilibrate to room temperature.Note: Plasmids should be purified using a kit or protocol that will remove endotoxin, such as PureYeild Plasmid System from Promega.Pre-warm Opti-MEM to 37 °C.Transfection (Carry out under a Laminar flow hood)Carry out transfections according to protocol details (LightSwitch Dual Assay System; link to protocol found above) for a 96-well plate with minimal changes.Cypridina TK control construct, pTK-Cluc: 1 ng (One nanogram is used instead of 10 ng due to luciferase saturation)pLightSwitch_Prom, pLightSwitch_Prom_BMX or pLightSwitch_Prom_BMXmHRE: 30 ngThe ratio of FuGENE® HD to plasmid: 3:1 (0.",
    "3 μl FuGENE:100 ng DNA per well)Briefly, the transfection protocol is:Combine reagents as indicated in the following table and mix well.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180719/20180719223814_9598.jpgLet sit at RT for 30 min.Gently drop onto seeded wells.Gently shake.Plates should be incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in normoxia (5% CO2).Day 3 (Under a Laminar flow hood)Remove the transfection reagents by changing out the media on both plates.Transfer one plate into hypoxia (5% CO2, 94% N2, and 1% O2) at 37 °C and maintain another one in normoxia.Incubate both plates for an additional 24 h.Note: Incubation time can be varied depending on the induction rate of your favorite gene due to hypoxia. Day 4 Follow the manufacturer's instructions (LightSwitch Dual Assay System[href=https://www.activemotif.com/documents/1945.pdf]) for measuring Renilla (pLightSwitch_Prom vectors) and Cypridina (pTK-Cluc) luciferase activity.No alterations were made to the protocol detailed by SwitchGear Genomics. Plates were always measured fresh and never frozen.For hypoxia conditions (all done within the hypoxia chamber):Adding reagents and incubations are all done within the hypoxia chamber.Remove the plates from hypoxia and immediately read the luminescence on a plate reader.For normoxia conditions: Adding reagents and incubation are all done at room temperature on the bench top."
