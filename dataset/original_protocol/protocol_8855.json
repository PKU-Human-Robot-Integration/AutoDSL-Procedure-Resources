    "All experiments were carried out in accordance with the guidelines for the welfare of experimental animals issued by the U.S. Public Health Service Policy on Human Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) Animal Research Committee. Male and female adult Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Lab, Wilmington, MA) between the age of 3-5 weeks were used.\n1. Animal and Tissue Preparation for Wholemount Retina and Immunohistochemistry Protocol\nPrepare the following materials and tools: A dissecting microscope, 2 forceps with very fine tips, scissors, cellulose filter paper, plastic pipette and a microscope slide.\nEuthanize the rat in a closed chamber by deeply anesthetizing the animal with 1-3% isoflurane followed by decapitation with a guillotine. Remove the eyes with a pair of iris scissors and place in a Petri dish containing the extracellular solution. Hibernate A, Ames Medium or physiological solutions are recommended.\n[Optional step if backfilling of RGCs with Fluo-4 is desired]. Perform the Fluo-4 labeling as described in the steps 2.3-2.4.\nUsing the dissecting microscope (light intensity: 1.6 x 108 photons/mm2⋅sec), remove the cornea by cutting off the front of the eye ball. Remove the lens and vitreous from the inner retinal surface with forceps. To remove the vitreous, stabilize the eyeball by holding the sclera firmly with one forcep. Gently peel the vitreous base toward the center of the retina with the other forcep. The preparation at this stage is called the eyecup, which is used for cryosections. More details about cryosections can be found in references 14,15.",
    "Remove the retina from the eyecup. Then, make four cuts to allow the retina to lay flat. Gently mount the retina on a microscope slide with the photoreceptor layer up. Add one drop of solution to the retina and put cellulose filter paper on the retina. Once the retina attaches to the filter paper, place the retina back in solution. If needed, flatten the retina with a brush or forceps.\nPlace the wholemounted retinas into 4% PFA for 10-15 min for fixation.\nWash the wholemounted retinas three times for 30 min in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB), pH 7.4. Block the retinas with 5% normal goat serum or donkey serum in 0.1 PB containing 0.3% Triton-X 100 and 0.1% NaN3 at 4 °C overnight. We recommend a final volume of 500 μl for all the steps to save blocking solutions and antibodies.\nNext day, incubate the retinae wholemounts with the primary antibody 5-7 days at 4 °C. Optimal dilutions must be determined by the user.\nWash the retinas 3 x 30 min in PB 0.1 M and incubate overnight at 4 °C in the corresponding fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody that is directed against the species of the primary antibody (concentration 1:1,000).\nAfter three final washes of 30 min each with PB, mount the retinas in mounting medium. Seal the coverslips with nail polish for prolonged storage. Store samples at 4 °C and protect from light.\n2. Labeling of Ganglion Cells and Axons in Rat Wholemount Retinas with a Calcium Indicator Dye\nPrepare 1,000 ml of mammalian Ringer's containing (in mM) 125 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 1 MgCl2, 25 NaHCO3, and 10 glucose bubbled with 95% O2/ 5% CO­2.\nPerform the dissection as described in the steps 1.2-1.4.",
    "To load retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons with a calcium indicator dye, inject 0.5 μl of Fluo-4 pentapotassium salt (40 mM stock in H­2O) into the optic nerve stump approximately 1 mm posterior to the eyeball using a syringe. To measure dynamic increases in ganglion cell [Ca2+]i an indicator with high affinity, such as Fluo-4 with its Kd of 345 nM, is optimal. Fluo-4 offers the additional benefit of having a very high quantum efficiency resulting in an emission increase of >100 fold when bound to calcium.\nPlace the eyecup in mammalian Ringer's bubbled with 95% O2/ 5% CO­2 for 1 hr at room temperature in the dark.\n3. Calcium Imaging Protocol for Retinal Ganglion Cells and Axons.\nRemove the eye, lens and vitreous as described in steps 1.1-1.4. Isolate the retina from the eyecup and divide into quadrants. Mount one quadrant ganglion cell side up on a glass slide and use a harp slice grid to stabilize it. Keep the other pieces dark-adapted in mammalian Ringer's bubbled with 95% O2/ 5% CO­2 on ice for later use.\nSuperfuse the recording chamber with mammalian Ringer's solution and keep the solution bubbling continuously with 95% O2/5% CO2.\nImage the tissue under the microscope. Conduct experiments at room temperature (~23 °C) or achieve physiological temperatures by warming the stage, heating the water bath under the specimen or applying warm air to the surface of the specimen.\n\tNote: It is important to note that many cellular functions are regulated by temperature, which plays a key role in maintaining intracellular homeostasis16. However, introduction of warming measures may increase the rate of photobleaching, evaporation of the medium and focus drift caused by thermal expansion17. Use of room temperature decreases intracellular compartmentalization of Fluo-418.",
    "Perform a control of two paired high K+ pulses in the absence of drugs. Depolarize RGCs and RGC axons by raising the [K+]o from 3 mM to 60 mM for 33 sec during each pulse to activate VGCCs with an eight channel gravity driven superfusion system. Reduce Na+ by 57 mM to maintain isosmolarity in the elevated K+ solution.\nAssess the contribution of different VGCCs to the calcium signal with the use of general or specific Ca channel blockers. For example, the reduction in calcium signal following the administration of a non-specific calcium channel blocker, cobalt, provided a semi-quantitative measure of the contribution of the VGCCs to the high K+-evoked calcium signal.\nAcquire fluorescence intensity values by placing a region of interest (ROI) around the RGCs of interest (Figure 2).\nNormalize the change in fluorescence intensity produced by the second high K+ peak to the change produced by the first high K+ peak. Then, for testing of specific calcium channel blockers, apply drugs only during the second high K+ pulse of a pair and normalize this peak against the first peak value. To measure the affect of the drug on the high K+ peak, divide the amplitude of the second K+ peak by that of the first. Analysis should be performed on these values in respect to their matching controls derived from paired high K+ peaks measured in the absence of drug.\nAcquire images at 5 sec intervals. To avoid photo-bleaching, keep the laser excitation as low as possible. Provide excitation by the 488 nm line of the argon laser, while the photomultiplier tube collects the fluorescent emission through a 505 nm LP filter.\nSubscription Required.
