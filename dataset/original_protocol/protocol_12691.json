    "Generation of inducible EED rescue mESCs\n1. Cell culture\nUse feeder-free C57BL/6 mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) possessing a stably integrated CreERT2 transgene, which can translocate to the nucleus upon administration of 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT)13.\nGrow mESCs in conventional ESC medium14,15, supplemented with 1000 U/mL LIF, 1 μM ERK inhibitor PD0325901 and 3 μM GSK3 inhibitor CHIR99021. For conventional ESC medium, use knockout DMEM containing 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1X penicillin/streptomycin and 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol.\nUse plates coated with 0.1% gelatin solution for culturing mESCs.\n2. Generation of clonal EED knockout (KO) mESCs\nDesign guide RNAs (gRNAs) to delete Exon 10 and Exon 11 of endogenous copy of EED in mESCs using the CRISPR design tool in Benchling16. EED-KO-gRNA-1 targets the intron immediately upstream of exon 10 and EED-KO-gRNA-2 targets the intron immediately downstream of Exon 11. The simultaneous application of these gRNAs deletes both Exon 10 and Exon 11 by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ).\nClone gRNAs into pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP (PX458) using instructions in Ran et al., 201317.\nIn a 6-well plate format, transfect 2 x 105 mESCs with 1 μg of each EED-KO-gRNA-1 and EED-KO-gRNA-2 (see Table of Materials) using transfection reagent by following the manufacturer's instructions. Change the media 24 h after transfection.\nTwo days after the transfection, isolate GFP positive cells using Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Expect the transfection efficiency to vary around 10-30 %. Sort around 5 x 105 cells to capture sufficient GFP positive cells for plating.\nPlate the isolated GFP positive mESCs into 15 cm plates pre-coated with 0.1% gelatin (10-20 x103 cells per plate) for colony picking.\nGrow the cells in ESC medium for about one week until single colonies are visible. Change the media every 2 days.",
    "Pick a minimum of 48 colonies using 20 μL micropipette tip. Scrape over the colony while aspirating into the micropipette tip. Do not break up the colony into single cells. Transfer the colony into an accutase-containing (20 μL) 96 well plate.\nIncubate the colonies for 10 min at 37 °C until all cells are dissociated.\nAdd 200 μL of ESC media into each well using multichannel pipette.\nMix well and plate the cells into two separate 96 well plates using multichannel pipette.\nUse one of the 96 well plates for genotyping and keep the other growing until genotyping is concluded. Use DNA extraction solution to extract DNA from the 96 well plate by following the manufacturer's instructions.\nUse genotyping primers Gnt_EED-KO-up and Gnt_EED-KO_down, which span the deleted site and perform genotyping PCR with Taq DNA polymerase following the manufacturer’s instructions.\n\tNOTE: Other types of DNA polymerases can also be used for genotyping, however, Taq DNA polymerase offers convenience as the PCR reaction can directly be loaded on a gel when its colored reaction buffer is used.\n\t\nObserve a DNA product of lower molecular weight in cells with a homozygous deletion relative to the wild-type (WT) case.\n\t\tNOTE: To generate PRC2 null cells, homozygous deletion of exons 10 and 11 is necessary to destabilize and degrade EED, an essential subunit of core PRC213. The CRISPR targeting efficiency is around 10 %.\nValidate the deletion of EED exon 10 and 11 and the loss of EED protein by Sanger sequencing and Western blotting, respectively.\nConfirm the depletion of EED and H3K27me2/me3 from chromatin in EED KO cells by ChIP-seq using antibodies against H3K27me2/me3 and EED. Use the protocol given in Oksuz et al., 201715 for ChIP-seq experiments.\n3. Engineering the EED knockout mESCs to harbor Cre-ERT2 based inducible EED expression",
    "Design gRNA (EED-gRNA-inducible) to introduce a cut within the intron following exon 9 of EED using the CRISPR design tool in Benchling16 (see Table of Materials).\nClone gRNAs into pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP (PX458) using instructions in Ran et al., 201317.\nDesign a donor template DNA that comprises EED cDNA sequence after exon 9 and a C-terminal Flag-HA tag upstream of a T2A-GFP sequence, all in reverse orientation with respect to the endogenous gene sequence.\n\t\nFlank the cassette with a splice-acceptor and a polyadenylation sequence nested between heterologous inverted loxP sites (lox66 and lox71)18.\nInclude at least 500 bp of homology arms from each end. Split the donor template into 2 segments of gBlocks gene fragments (see gBlock-1, gBlock-2-WT \"https://benchling.com/s/seq-l2LLlWNEnLrfGXcbdCxI\" and gBlock-2-cage-mutant \"https://benchling.com/s/seq-n8eiZCB2XAkOuzzpv6qM\") and assemble them into PCR Blunt vector using Gibson cloning following the manufacturer's instructions.\n\t\tNOTE: gblock-2 contains an aromatic residue (Y365) within the cage of EED that is important for interaction with H3K27me312. gBlock-2-Wt contains wild type residue, whereas gblock-2-cage-mutant contains the cage-mutant of EED (Y365A), incapable of binding to H3K27me3. Inducible WT EED rescue is denoted as i-WT-r and inducible cage-mutant EED rescue is denoted as i-MT-r for convenience.\nIn a 6-well plate format, transfect 2 x 105 mESCs with 1 μg of the gRNA (EED-gRNA-inducible) and 1 μg of the Donor templates (i-WT-r or i-MT-r) using transfection reagent and isolate GFP positive cells using FACS.\nFollow steps 2.3-2.11 to isolate individual colonies ready for genotyping for successful targeting.\nUse genotyping primers Inducible_Genotype-FW-1 and Inducible_Genotype-REV-1, which span the inserted cassette and perform genotyping PCR using Taq DNA polymerase.\n\tNOTE: The targeting efficiency for CRISPR is around 10 %.\n\t\nConfirm correct integration of the cassette by PCR using Inducible_Genotype-FW-2 and Inducible_Genotype-REV-2 primers, which are outside of the homology arms.",
    "NOTE: Homozygous integration of the cassette is necessary to accomplish efficient rescue of EED. Note that cells with homozygous integration will produce a single large DNA product as compared to WT EED, which will produce a short product.\nConfirm the integration of the cassette by Sanger sequencing.\nConfirm flipping of the cassette and the expression of EED and other PRC2 core components (e.g., EZH2 and SUZ12) upon 4-OHT administration by Western blotting.\nConfirm the expression of T2A-GFP and percentage of flip by flow cytometry. Note that expression of GFP is indicative of flipping of the cassette and the expression of EED.\n4. Following nucleation and spreading of PRC2 activity on chromatin\nConfirm that i-WT-r and i-MT-r mESCs do not have leaky expression of GFP by flow cytometry. In the case of leaky expression of GFP, isolate GFP-negative cells by FACS before starting the experiment.\nExpand the i-WT-r and i-MT-r mESCs into five 15 cm plates (5x 106 cells per plate).\nInduce expression of WT or cage-mutant EED by administration of 0.5 μM 4-OHT for 0 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h and 8 days (one 15 cm plate per condition). Change the media after 12 h for treatments longer than 12 h. Isolate the successfully recombined cells by FACS using GFP. Adjust the time of the treatments such that all of the conditions are collected at once.\nPerform ChIP-seq for H3K27me2, H3K27me3 to investigate their temporal deposition to chromatin in response to re-expression of WT or cage-mutant EED. Use ChIP-seq protocol including library preparation detailed in Oksuz et al., 201715.\nUse spike-in control in each sample to allow for quantitative comparison among different time points19.",
    "For spike-in control, use chromatin from Drosophila melanogaster (in a 1:50 ratio to the mESC-derived chromatin) as well as Drosophila specific H2Av antibody (1 μL of H2Av antibody per 4 μg of Drosophila chromatin according to manufacturer’s instructions) in each sample.\nPrepare the chromatin from Drosophila in a manner similar to that from mESCs using the protocol detailed in Oksuz et al., 201715.\nMap the sequence reads for ChIP-seq to mm10 genome with Bowtie 2 using default parameters20.\nNormalize the mouse ChIP-seq reads to spike-in Drosophila read counts21. Calculate the spike-in normalization factor using the following formula: 1 x 106/unique Drosophila read counts. Expect to get around 1 x 106 Drosophila read counts and 20 x 106 mouse read counts per experiment.\n\t\nDo not include the Drosophila chromatin when sequencing the input samples.\nUse genomecov tool from bedtools to convert bam file into bedgraph22. Next, convert the bedgraph into bigwig file using bedGraphToBigWig tool from USCS23,24. See the following script:\ngen=\"path to mm10 genome\"\nchr=\"path to mm10 chromosome sizes\"\ninp_bam=\"path to input bam file \"\nmultiply=\"calculate the spike-in normalization factor\"\nbedtools genomecov -bg -scale $multiply -ibam $inp_bam -g $gen > output.bedGraph\nsort -k1,1 -k2,2n output.bedGraph > output_sorted.bedGraph\nbedGraphToBigWig output_sorted.bedGraph $chr output.bw\nVisualize the ChIP-seq read densities by uploading the bigwig files on the USCS genome browser24.\n5. Monitoring emergence and growth of the H3K27me3 foci in the mESCs nuclei\nPlate 1x 104 mESCs into 8-well chamber slides pre-coated with 0.1% gelatin.\nNext day, start performing consecutive 4-OHT (0.5 μM) inductions to collect the cells expressing EED for indicated time points (0 h, 12 h, 24 h and 36 h). Change the media after 12 h for treatments longer than 12 h.\nFix the mESCs with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature (RT) for 10 min.",
    "Permeabilize the cells with PBS/0.25% Triton X-100 at RT for 30 min.\nBlock the cells with PBS/5% donkey serum/0.1% Triton X-100 (blocking buffer) at RT for 30 min.\nDilute H3K27me3 primary antibody 1:500 in the blocking buffer and add onto the cells.\nIncubate the cells with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C.\nNext day, perform 3 washes with PBS/0.1% Triton X-100.\nDilute secondary antibody (Alexa fluor 595) 1:1000 in the blocking buffer and add onto cells.\n\t\nPerform all incubations in dark in the following steps as secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor are light sensitive.\nIncubate the secondary antibody for 2 h at RT.\nPerform 3 washes with PBS/0.1% Triton X-100.\nDilute DAPI (1 mg/mL) 1:4000 with PBS/0.1% Triton X-100 and add onto cells.\nIncubate the cells with DAPI for 10 min at RT.\nMount the cells with Aqua mount.\nImage the cells with confocal microscopy at 63X magnification.\nProcess and pseudo-color the images using a distribution of ImageJ, Fiji25. \nSubscription Required.
