    "1. Creating the Chamber\nUsing a glass cutter, cut 3 mm wide strips from the end of a 1 mm thick microscope slide. Using a cyanoacrylate super-glue or double-sided tape, glue these glass strips approximately 45 mm apart across the width of a second microscope slide (Figure 1A). One slide per chamber is required, plus additional slides to pour agar slabs (one slide will yield 2-3 agar slabs). Slides can be reused.\nBetween the glass strips, fashion a gasket of identical height out of gas-permeant poly(dimethylsiloxane) gum. Place a ball of poly(dimethylsiloxane) gum onto the slide (Figure 1B), wet a second slide with a small quantity of 100% absolute ethanol, and flatten the poly(dimethylsiloxane) gum ball with the second slide until it has reached the height of the glass strips (Figure 1C).\nIf necessary, trim excess poly(dimethylsiloxane) gum with a razor blade and repeat flattening.\nUsing a suitable cutter or razor blade wetted in absolute ethanol, remove the interior part of the poly(dimethylsiloxane) gum to create the cavity that will later hold the seedling and agar slab (Figure 1D).\nCarefully trim the gel with a razor blade to create a gasket with a final wall thickness of approximately 2 mm (Figure 1E). The permeability of gases through a poly(dimethylsilaxane) barrier is independent of thicknesses above 50 µm11.\n2. Creating the Agar-solidified Slab of Growth Medium\nOn a microscopy slide with two glass strips, place a coverslip (22 mm x 50 mm) so that it rests on both glass strips.\nPipette melted half-strength Murashige and Skoog growth medium containing 1% w/v sucrose and 1.5% w/v agar (½ MS) into the resulting space below the coverslip until the latter is completely filled (approximately 1 mL total volume) and leave until agar is set (approximately 5 min).",
    "Note: Pharmacological compounds can be administered through the agar slab by adding appropriate concentrations to the liquid medium before the slab is poured. This was successfully tested for dexamethasone12, isoxaben, 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile (DCB), oryzalin, and latrunculin B.\n3. Finishing the Chamber Setup\nAir equilibrate PFD by shaking a small volume of PFD in a tube7. Add a small amount (approximately 200 µL) of air-equilibrated PFD to the well of the gel gasket, but do not fill the chamber completely. This PFD will help to avoid the trapping of air bubbles under the agar slab as it is placed into the chamber.\nRemove the coverslip from the agar slab (at step 2.2 above) and use a razor blade to cut off a portion of desired size and shape. Then place it into the well of the gel gasket (Figure 1F). There should be a gap of 2-4 mm to the gasket all around.\nFill the chamber completely with air-equilibrated PFD.\nPlace one or more A. thaliana seedlings (up to 3 seedlings for imaging over 2-3 days) onto the agar slab with the cotyledons and hypocotyl hanging over the edge, floating in PFD (Figure 1G).\nTo obtain seedlings, sterilize seeds with 70% ethanol, plant on ½ MS medium supplemented with 1% sucrose and 0.8% agar, stratify for 2-4 days at 4 °C, and grow on vertically oriented plates at 22 °C in a 16 h light/8 h dark regime. For imaging lateral roots, grow plants for 7-10 days before transferring to imaging chambers.\nTo close the chamber, apply a coverslip matched to the optics of the objective, gently pressing it down with the edge of a glass microscope slide until the coverslip rests on both glass strips (Figure 1H).",
    "Secure the coverslip with strips of 1.25 cm wide micropore surgical tape cut in half length-wise on each end if desired (Figure 1I). Allow the specimen to settle for approximately 30 min before imaging. This minimizes specimen movement during imaging.\nPerform imaging with an upright microscope to maintain a controlled substrate for growth. Use 20X/0.7NA or 63X/1.2NA CS2 objectives."
