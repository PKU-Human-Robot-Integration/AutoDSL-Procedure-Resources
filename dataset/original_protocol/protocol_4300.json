    "Set up 10 µl deaminase assay reactions in 0.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes as follows. First prepare a deaminase assay Master Mix, with enough volume for all of the reactions plus some excess. The table below gives the recipe for a Master Mix for 10 reactions, although enough Master Mix (99 µl) is prepared for 11 reactions:table:\n﻿0,1,2\nDeaminase assay components,Amount per reaction,Master mix\nWater,7.5 µl,82.5 µl\n10x deaminase buffer,1 µl,11 µl\nFluorophore-labeled oligonucleotide substrate (10 pmol/µl),0.5 µl,5.5 µl\nDispense 9 µl of the Master Mix into each tube; then add 1 µl of the protein preparation to be assayed to each tube. In our experience, approximately 0.25 µg of mouse APOBEC3 is sufficient for deamination of a large fraction of the oligodeoxynucleotide substrate in this assay. (A no-protein, “blank” control reaction should also be prepared to which protein buffer, instead of protein, is added.)Gently mix the reactants by pipetting up and down, and if required, give a quick spin to collect all the contents at the bottom of the tube. Incubate the reaction in a 37 °C water bath for 2 h.Note: During the 2 h incubation at 37 °C, centrifuge the contents of the tubes at low speed occasionally as moisture tends to accumulate at the tube caps owing to evaporation.Prepare UDG Master Mix as indicated in the table below. For example, if 10 assays are being performed, prepare 55 µl UDG Master Mix, i.e., enough for 5 µl/reaction + 5 µl excess volume:table:\n﻿0,1,2\nUDG enzyme mix,Amount per reaction,Master mix\nWater,2.75 µl,30.25 µl\n10x UDG buffer,1.5 µl,16.5 µl\nUDG enzyme (1 U/µl),0.75 µl,8.25 µl",
    "Add 5 µl of this UDG Master Mix to the 10 µl deaminase assay reaction tubes from step 1. Gently mix the reactants and incubate in the 37 °C water bath for 45 min.Following the 45 min incubation, add 5 µl of 0.6 N NaOH to each tube and incubate further at 37 °C for 20 min.Add an equal volume (20 µl) of 2x RNA loading dye to each tube, heat at 95 °C for 2-3 min, and place on ice immediately.Load 15 µl of each sample onto a 15% TBE-UREA PAGE gel and resolve the cleaved and uncleaved products by electrophoresis at 150 volts for 3 h at room temperature (25 °C) in 1x TBE buffer. (Before loading the samples, flush the wells with running buffer using a syringe fitted with a needle. This removes residual urea or acrylamide from the wells and minimizes the probability of samples smearing on the gel.)In order to visualize the uncleaved substrate and cleaved product(s), remove the gel carefully from the cast, slice away the sealing gel end at the bottom, and place the gel onto a clean glass plate. Carefully place a cling film/saran wrap on the gel; remove any air bubbles between the gel and the film by gently rolling a roller (supplied with the gel apparatus) or a Pasteur pipette over it. Air bubbles tend to interfere with the fluorescence imaging. A trick to avoid air bubbles and to keep the gel from drying and breaking is to generously put several drops of water on the gel before placing the cling film.Place the gel on the fluorescence reader, gel side facing the scanner and glass side up. The scanner should be set for AlexaFluor 488 (excitation 495 nm, Emission 519 nm), PMT 600, sensitivity normal, and scanning speed 200 microns."
