    "1. Identify Transcription Factor Binding Sites in the Promoter of MicroRNA Genes Using Data Mining Approach\nUse the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser to extract chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing data generated as part of the Encyclopedia of DNA element (ENCODE) project.\n\t\nOpen the table browser in the UCSC genome browser.\nUse the following specifications to extract the table: Clade: (Mammals), genome: (Human), Assembly: (Feb2009(GRch37/hg18)), group: (regulation), track (TxnFactorChIP), table: (weEncoderesTFbsCo7steredv3), region: (Genome), output format (all genes from selected table).\nSave the output from 1.1.2 as a .txt file and into a spreadsheet.\nSort and filter for the transcription factor of interest (e.g., STAT2).\nUse the list of microRNA promoters based on H3K4me3 epigenetics signature available at Baeer et al.9. Copy this list into a .txt file.\nTo match according to coordinates on the human genome, map the data from 1.1 and 1.2 (e.g., STAT3 binding on putative microRNA promoters) and determine the median binding affinity using the code written in C sharp as outlined in supplemental coding file 1.\n2. Use shRNA to Down-regulate the Expression of a Transcription Factor of Interest\nPlate 1.5 x 106 cells from 293 human embryonic kidney cell line in 10 cm plate at approximately 50% confluence (DMEM with 10% FBS).\nTransfect cells from 293 human embryonic kidney cell line with 5 µg of green fluorescence protein (GFP) lentivirus containing shRNA directed to the transcription factor of interest and with 5 µg of packaging vectors using transfection reagent for adherent cells according to manufacturer's protocol.\nAs a control, transfect the cells from 293 human embryonic kidney cell line with scrambled shRNA and the packaging vectors according to manufacturer's protocol.",
    "Keep transfection mix on cells for 16 hr (at 37 °C, CO2 incubator), then change media to 10 ml fresh 10% DMEM media with 10% FBS.\nWait 48 hr post transfection, centrifuge the cell culture (300 x g, 5 min) and collect infectious supernatant. Filter the supernatant through a 0.45 µm syringe filter (25-mm surfactant free cellulose acetate membrane) to remove any floating cells.\nConcentrate the supernatant and collect the lentivirus using an ultracentrifugal filter device with threshold of 100 kDa. Spin at 950 x g for 30 - 60 min until the volume has been concentrate to less than 250 µl. Store the concentrated virus at -80 °C.\nTransfect the cells with the lentivirus. Remove frozen lentivirus from -80 °C freezer and thaw to room temperature. Transfer 100 µl of viral supernatant to a fresh 1.5 ml microfuge tube.\n\t\nBring up the volume in the tube to 1 ml with reduced serum medium. Add hexadimethrine bromide to 1 ml virus suspension for final concentration of 10 ng/ml, mix gently and let the mixture stand for 5 min.\nCentrifuge 5 x 106 cells for each transduction and gently resuspend the cell pellet in 0.5 ml of media containing virus. Let the cells stay in the incubator for 4 - 24 hr, then add 0.5 ml of medium with 20% FBS to a final concentration of 10% FBS.\nWait 48 to 72 hr and stain the cells with propidium iodide (PI) and green florescent protein (GFP) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protect the cells from light and use a FACS sorter to measure the rates of GFP+ / PI- cells. Since PI stains only dead cell, this rate is an estimate of transfection efficiency in living cells.",
    "Sort the positive cell population to GFP expression (GFP+) by FACS sorter as previously described 10.\nUse Western immune blotting as previously described 10 to determine the levels of a transcription factor of interest before and after infecting the cells of interest (for example, CLL cells) with designated shRNA.\n3. Determine the Expression Level of MicroRNA Transcriptome in Cells Transfected with Transcription Factor-shRNA\nIsolate RNA using a commercial kit according to manufacturer's protocol.\nLabel the RNA and hybridize it to microRNA microarray11.\nDetermine the differentially expressed microRNA in cells transfected with transcription factor-shRNA or with empty vector controls5.\nValidate the microarray results for the most differentially expressed microRNAs using real-time PCR 5.\n4. Determine the Overlap between the Bioinformatics and the shRNA Approach in Describing the Transcription Factor Dependent Transcriptome\nTo determine the expected and observed ratios of microRNA genes that harbor transcription factor binding sites in their promoters and were downregulated in transcription factor-shRNA transfected cells, do the following:\n\t\nObtain the ratio of genes that harbor the transcription factor of interest in their promoter / total microRNA from the list generated in 1.3. This list is the expected ratio (e.g., microRNA genes with STAT3 binding sites / total microRNA genes tested = 0.25).\nDetermine the number of genes that were downregulated in transcription factor-shRNA transfected cells from the list generated in 3.3 AND has transcription factor of interest binding sites from the list generated in 1.3. This number/Total number of downregulated genes is the observed ratio (e.g., microRNA genes with STAT3 binding sites/total number of downregulated microRNAs = 0.6).\nUse χ2 statistics to compare the observed and expected ratios that were generated above and determine whether the list of genes that were downregulated in transcription factor-shRNA transfected cells are enriched with transcription factor binding sites in their promoter.",
