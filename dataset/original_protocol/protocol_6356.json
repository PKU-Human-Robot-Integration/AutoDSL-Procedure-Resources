    "Enzymatic measurement of trehalose and glycogen to estimate steady-state amountsFor trehalose and glycogen measurements, grow the cells in appropriate medium at 30 °C. The growth medium can be either rich medium (Recipe 8) or synthetic minimal medium (Recipe 9).Harvest equal number of cells for different samples (~10 A600 for yeast cells, as measured using a spectrophotometer, for each estimation of trehalose and glycogen) by transferring the cells to either 15- or 50-ml Falcon tube, centrifuge the tubes quickly at 3,000 x g for 3 min.Carefully remove the supernatant and wash the cells once with 1 ml of ice-cold water in a 1.5 ml screw cap tube by centrifugation at maximum speed for 15 s.Carefully remove the supernatant using either the pipette tip or a syringe connected to vacuum.Note: This step is important for the removal of residual glucose from the medium. After this step, the cells can be frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until further use. Lyse the cells by resuspending the cell pellet in 0.25 ml of 0.25 M sodium carbonate and incubate the tube at 95-98 °C for 4 h.Note: The sodium carbonate helps in alkali-based permeabilization of the cells, which allows trehalase and amyloglucosidase enzymes to digest trehalose and glycogen respectively. This step can be done either in the dry heating block or water incubator with occasional mixing of the tubes. Add 0.15 ml of 1 M glacial acetic acid and 0.6 ml of 0.2 M sodium acetate to the tube to adjust the pH of the solution to 5.2.Note: Glacial acetic acid and sodium acetate are added to bring the pH of the cell suspension to an acidic range, since the optimum pH for the trehalase and amyloglucosidase enzymes are ~5.7 and ~5 respectively.",
    "Do not mix too vigorously at this step, as there is production of carbon dioxide. For trehalose and glycogen measurements, add 0.05 U/ml of trehalase enzyme and 1-2 U/ml of amyloglucosidase enzymes respectively. Incubate the tubes overnight with constant rotation in the hybridization oven (or rotatory incubator) at 37 °C for digestion of trehalose and at 57 °C for digestion of glycogen.Centrifuge the tubes at maximum speed, room temperature for 3 min. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a fresh 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube without disturbing the pellet.The assay for the glucose released from these digestions using a Glucose (GO) Assay Kit is as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, transfer either undiluted sample (0.04 ml) or suitably diluted sample (1:1 or 1:4) in triplicates to a 96-well plate. Add 0.08 ml of reconstituted glucose oxidase/peroxidase/o-dianisidine reagent to each well. Incubate the plate at 37 °C for 30 min. Stop the reaction by adding 0.08 ml of 12 N sulfuric acid and read the absorbance at 540 nm in a plate reader. The concentration of released glucose (mg/ml) is determined using the standard curve.Preparing metabolite extracts (to extract trehalose and other metabolites from cells)Note: This is shown as the schematic in Figure 2. Grow the cells in appropriate medium at 30 °C. The growth medium can be either rich medium (Recipe 8) or synthetic minimal medium (Recipe 9). Harvest an equal number of cells for different samples (~6-10 A600 for yeast cells using a spectrophotometer) during the logarithmic phase of growth. The volume of the culture to be harvested can range from 5 to 10 ml.Quench metabolism in the cells for 5 min in 4 volumes of 60% methanol in a 50 ml Falcon tube (maintained at -40 °C to -45 °C).",
    "Note: Use dry ice to maintain the temperature of the 60% methanol contained in the dewar at -40 °C to -45 °C. Do not cool to below -50 °C as cells will freeze at that temperature. In case, the temperature drops below -50 °C, bring it to -45 °C by pouring 60% methanol maintained at room temperature into the dewar. Once the temperature is set at -40 °C to -45 °C, it is maintained for a while, and therefore stringent temperature controlling methods are not needed at this step. Centrifuge the tubes at 1,000 x g for 3 min (set at -5 °C).Note: Cool all the centrifuges to -5 °C even before harvesting the cells. Carefully remove the supernatant and then resuspend the pellet in cold 0.7 ml of 60% methanol (maintained at -45 °C).Transfer the suspension to 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes and centrifuge this suspension at 1,000 x g for 3 min (set at -5 °C).Note: Keep the 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes chilled by placing them in 60% methanol dewar (set at -45 °C). Carefully remove the supernatant using a pipette (and not vacuum based aspiration), and resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of 75% ethanol.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191229/20191229232717_1571.jpgFigure 2. Steady-state measurements of trehalose using (A) either an enzyme based colorimetric assay or (B) HPLC-MS/MS based analysis. The enzymatic assay is simple and low-cost, and measures total trehalose. The LC-MS/MS based analysis is very sensitive (100-1000 fold higher than the enzyme based assay), and can unambiguously detect and quantify total trehalose in the extracts, and can also be used to differentiate the source of trehalose when used in conjunction with stable-isotope labeling.Keep the tubes at 80 °C for 3 min, with intermittent vortexing, followed by incubation on ice for 5 min.",
    "Centrifuge the tubes at maximum speed for 1 min at room temperature to pellet the extracted cells. Transfer 0.96 ml of the supernatant to a fresh 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, centrifuge again at maximum speed for 10 min at room temperature to pellet any remaining cell debris.Transfer 0.45 ml of the supernatant to two fresh 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes.Dry the supernatant in a vacuum dryer for 3-4 h and then store at -80 °C until further use.Estimating trehalose by LC-MS/MSNote: Also see schematic in Figure 2. Prepare a stock of 0.25-1 µg/ml trehalose solution to be used as a standard in LC-MS/MS. This solution is prepared such that the effective standard concentration used in each LC-MS/MS run is 5-10 ng. Make multiple dilutions of this stock to determine the linear range for trehalose estimation, such that 1-50 ng of trehalose is loaded onto the column.Use appropriate volumes of the solvent solution (Recipe 7) to dissolve the samples. The solvent volume can range from 0.05 ml to 0.5 ml, depending on the concentration of trehalose in the samples and the linear dynamic range of the mass spectrometer.Note: It will be appropriate to dissolve the sample in smaller volumes at first, and then dilute it further if needed. Resolve metabolite extracts by injecting into the HPLC column, and analyze the metabolites using MS/MS. Measure trehalose using a negative polarity mode in the mass spectrometer. For further details on the buffers, column parameters, flow rate and the gradient, refer to the method described in detail in Walvekar et al., 2018.13C-labeling experiments for flux based trehalose synthesis estimationsNote: See Figure 3 for a typical labeling experiment workflow.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191229/20191229232741_4144.jpgFigure 3.

    "A schematic to show the use of stable-isotope labeled glucose to estimate trehalose synthesis coming from glycolysis (i.e., directly from glucose). B. A schematic to show the use of stable-isotope labeled aspartic acid to estimate trehalose synthesis from gluconeogenesis.13C-glucose labeling (direct incorporation of glucose into trehalose) For experiments to estimate the 13C-label incorporation into trehalose from glucose, grow the cells in appropriate medium at 30 °C till the logarithmic phase. Growth medium can be either rich medium (Recipe 8) or synthetic minimal medium (Recipe 9).Add labeled [U-13C6] glucose to the culture to reach a ratio of 50% unlabeled to 50% fully labeled glucose for ~5 min or less on a rocking platform (For cells grown in 2% unlabeled glucose, add 2% labeled glucose).Note: Since labeled glucose gets incorporated into trehalose directly, the incubation time with labeled glucose is critical and should be reduced to the minimum possible to avoid saturation of label incorporation into trehalose. This time should be optimized carefully based on preliminary label incorporation measurements. Harvest equal numbers of cells for different samples (~6-10 ml of yeast cells in culture at an A600 of ~1) and proceed as described in Step B2.Note: During harvesting an equal number of cells, measure the A600 of the culture before spiking in labeled glucose to minimize the delay in time. 13C-aspartate labeling (gluconeogenic flux into trehalose) For the 13C-label incorporation in trehalose from aspartate, grow the cells in an appropriate medium (containing glycerol/ethanol as carbon source) and collect cells when still in the logarithmic phase.Note: Alternatively, cells can be either grown in glucose till late-logarithmic phase (post-diauxic), or low glucose concentrations can also be used, depending on the needs of the experiment. Add labeled [U-13C4] aspartate to a final concentration of 1 mM and incubate for appropriate time.",
    "Note: The time of incubation with labeled aspartate can be optimized based on the linearity of the label incorporation into trehalose. ~15 min can be used as an earliest time-point since there are multiple steps involved in trehalose synthesis from aspartate via gluconeogenesis. Harvest an equal number of cells for different samples (~6-10 ml of yeast cells at A600 ~1) and proceed as described in Step B2.Normalizing MS/MS dataWe recommend using any two of the three approaches listed below, to ensure proper normalization of data coming from different samples. First, prepare all metabolite extracts from equal cell numbers, inject the same volumes into the mass spectrometer, and carry out all runs together. Second, the use of an internal standard added during extractions is strongly recommended. For this, the use of an unnatural disaccharide, or labeled disaccharide (e.g., melibiose) is ideal. Third, estimates of total ion count (for each injection) can be used to normalize the total amounts of samples injected."
