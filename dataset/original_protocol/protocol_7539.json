    "An overview of the procedure and data analysis workflow is presented in Figure 1.For NADP-MDH ex planta activity, follow sections A and C. For recombinant NADP-MDH activity (in vitro) assay, follow sections B and C. As a general advice, because this protocol uses plates and can measure up to 12 samples at the same time, triplicate assays can be easily performed in parallel for each sample type and for each experimental condition (initial or maximal activity for ex planta activity, activation kinetics for recombinant enzyme).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4769/bioprotoc-13-16-4769-g001.jpgFigure 1. Overview of the procedure and data analysis workflow. Grey circles refer to corresponding procedure sections. Blue circles refer to corresponding data analysis sections. For NADP-MDH ex planta activity, follow procedures A and C and then analysis A, B and C. For NADP-MDH in vitro assay, follow procedures B and C and then analysis A, B and D.Arabidopsis NADP-MDH extraction and activation, ex planta assay (alternative for B) Extraction from leaf samples:Using tweezers, collect one young adult leaf from a 4–5-week-old Arabidopsis plant in a collecting tube containing two metallic beads. Flash freeze samples in liquid nitrogen (see Note 2).Grind sample in collecting tube by shaking using a bead mill (1 min at a frequency of 30 vibrations per second). Bead mill racks must be pre-chilled in liquid nitrogen before use.Quickly add 150 μL of extraction buffer (see Recipe 1).Vortex for 15 s.Centrifuge at 12,000× g for 10 min at 4 °C.Transfer at least 120 μL of supernatant into a well of a PCR plate and keep on ice. Avoid pipetting debris since it may interfere with the measurement in the plate reader. This supernatant is hereafter called the crude extract.Measure initial NADP-MDH activity from crude extracts. We suggest measuring it at least three times for each sample (see Section C, step 4a.i.).",
    "Since the activity slows down rapidly after extraction due to spontaneous oxidation of the extract, these measurements should be performed as soon as possible.NADP-MDH activation:For each sample, prepare 12 μL of activation medium (see Recipe 2) and transfer this medium into a well of a PCR plate.Using the multichannel pipette, transfer 50 μL of crude extract into the PCR plate wells containing the activation medium. Mix by pipetting up and down three or four times. Avoid forming bubbles. If bubbles form, a short spin of the PCR plate can help to remove them.Incubate the plate at 21 °C for 20 min in a thermal cycler.Measure maximal NADP-MDH activity (see Section C, step 4a.ii.).Protein quantification:Dilute crude extract at 1/20 in Tris pH 6.8 buffer.Use 2 μL of diluted sample to assay the protein concentration with the Qubit Protein and Protein Broad Range (BR) Assay kit following the manufacturer’s protocol.Activation of recombinant NADP-MDH, in vitro assay (alternative for A) Prepare M1 and M2 medium (see Note 3 and Recipe 3)Prepare 15 μL of M1 medium per activation kinetics and transfer into a PCR plate.Prepare 15 μL of M2 medium per activation kinetics and transfer into another row of the same PCR plate.Incubate the plate at 21 °C for 5 min in a thermal cycler.Activation kinetics:Using a multichannel pipette, mix the 15 μL of M2 medium with the 15 μL of M1 medium. Mix by pipetting up and down three or four times, avoiding forming bubbles, and start the timer.Immediately measure the t0 NADP-MDH activity (see Section C, step 4b).If bubbles have formed at the previous step, a short spin down can help to remove them; in any case, be careful not to pipette them at further time points.Keep incubating at 21 °C and let the thermal cycler with the lid open.",
    "At each time point of the activation kinetics, measure the NADP-MDH activity (see Section C, step 4b). We suggest measuring activity at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 20, and 25 min of activation.NADP-MDH activity monitoring Create and save the program for the Tecan plate reader (see Note 4).Prepare reaction medium (see Recipe 4) and transfer 200 μL of this medium into each well of a Genetix plate (see Recipe 4).Prewarm at 30 °C the plate containing the reaction medium in the Tecan.Monitor the NADP-MDH activity (see Note 5).For ex planta assay:i. Measure initial NADP-MDH activity, as soon as possible after extraction. For this purpose, add 20 μL of crude extract to 200 μL of prewarmed reaction medium and mix as recommended in Note 4. Start OD340nm monitoring for 1 min. We recommend performing three measurements for each sample.ii. After 20 min activation at 21 °C, measure maximal NADP-MDH activity. Add 20 μL of activated extract to the 200 μL of prewarmed reaction medium and mix as recommended in Note 4. Start OD340nm monitoring for 1 min. We recommend performing three measurements for each sample.For in vitro assay: at each time point of the activation kinetics (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 20, and 25 min), withdraw 3 μL of activation mixture, add them to the 200 μL of prewarmed reaction medium, and mix as recommended in Note 4. Start monitoring OD340nm for 1 min.Export raw data to an Excel sheet through Magellan software interface."
