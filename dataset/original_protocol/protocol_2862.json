    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of wild type (WT) and catalytically-dead (H133Y) His-tagged recombinant SIRT6\nTiming: 4 days\nThis section describes the expression of His-SIRT6 in a bacterial system and purification of His-SIRT6 with High Affinity Ni-NTA Resin. A Superdex 75 10/300 GL column is used to obtain a high-purity His-SIRT6 protein and avoid the influence of imidazole on the deacetylation assay.\nTransform plasmid into competent cells.\nTransform 10 ng of the His-SIRT6 plasmids (WT or H133Y) into 100 μL of E. coli BL21 (DE3) competent cells and incubate on ice for 30 min.\nAlternatives: The type of media and/or antibiotics may vary depending on the bacterial strain used.\nCritical: This step should be performed under sterile conditions.\nHeat-shock the competent cells at 42°C for 60 s in a water-bath and then immediately transfer to ice.\nNote: The heat-shock must not exceed 90 s.\nCulture the cells in 1 mL of LB media without antibiotics at 37°C for 1 h with shaking (200 rpm).\nSpread the cells on an LB plate containing kanamycin (50 μg/mL, for selection) and incubate overnight (approximately 16 h) at 37°C without shaking.\nPick a single cell colony.\nPick a single cell colony from the plate using a 10-μL pipette filter tip.\nAdd it to 5 mL of LB media containing kanamycin (50 μg/mL).\nIncubate the colony at 37°C with shaking (200 rpm) until the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) reaches 0.5.\nCritical: This step should be performed under sterile conditions.\nNote: The regular incubation time is 6–8 h; however, the incubation period may be longer if the OD value does not reach 0.5, or shorter if the OD is much higher than 0.5.",
    "Transfer 5 mL of bacterial media into 500 mL of fresh LB media containing kanamycin (50 μg/mL) and culture at 37°C with shaking (200 rpm) until the OD600 reaches 0.5.\nNote: The regular incubation time is 6–8 h; however, the incubation period may be longer if the OD value does not reach 0.5, or shorter if the OD value is much higher than 0.5.\nCritical: The culture period and the OD600 value are important to the activity of the BL21 (DE3) cells. Low cell viability will result in poor target protein expression and greater contamination with more non-specific protein after purification. It is therefore important to comply with the recommended OD600 values and expanding ratios indicated in the above steps.\nInduction of SIRT6 expression\nAllow the bacterial culture to cool to room temperature (approximately 20°C).\nNote: The regular cool-down time in our laboratory is approximately 2–3 h; however, this may be longer or shorter depending on the container and ambient temperature. The OD600 should be monitored to ensure no marked changes occur during the incubation period.\nAlternatives: If the OD600 value is higher than 0.9 after cooling, the cool-down procedure could be performed on ice to shorten the incubation period.\nTo induce SIRT6 expression, add 500 μL of IPTG stock solution to the bacterial media to a final concentration of 0.5 mM.\nCritical: This step should be performed under sterile conditions.\nIncubate the bacterial media at 18°C for 16 h with shaking (150 rpm).\nPurification of SIRT6.\nNote: The entire purification section should be performed at 4°C or on ice.\nCollect the cultured cells by centrifugation at 4,000 ×g for 10 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 30 mL ice-cold PBS containing 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (add 300 μL of 100× protease inhibitor cocktail).",
    "After transferring to a fresh 50-mL tube, lyse the bacterial cells by sonication (30 cycles of 5 s ON and 5 s OFF with 55% power).\nNote: The cells should be kept on ice throughout the sonication process. After sonication, the lysate should be translucent or clear. If the samples are turbid or viscous, the number of sonication cycle should be increased until the lysate is translucent or clear. This protocol describes the use of an ultrasonic homogenizer (SCIENTZ JY92-2DN) with a 6-mm microtip. If other sonicators or microtips are used, the sonication conditions must be optimized.\nCentrifuge the above cell suspension at 17,000 ×g for 30 min at 4°C and transfer the clear supernatant containing SIRT6 to a fresh 50 mL tube.\nNote: A 50 μL aliquot of the supernatant can be removed and stored at −20°C, and then used as a whole cell lysate control when checking protein purity.\nEquilibrate 500 μL of high affinity Ni-NTA resin with 5 mL of PBS and then centrifuge at 135 ×g for 3 min at 4°C.\nCarefully discard the supernatant, ensuring the resin pellet is not disturbed. Repeat this step twice.\nAdd the equilibrated Ni-NTA resin to the bacterial cell lysate and incubate at 4°C for 1 h with end-over-end mixing.\nTransfer the mix to a fresh gravity flow column and allow the supernatant to flow down.\nAlternatives: If a gravity flow column is not available, resin can be separated from the eluate by centrifugation at 135 ×g for 3 min at 4°C.\nWash the resin.\nWash the resin with 5 mL of ice-cold Ni-NTA wash buffer containing 1× protease inhibitor cocktail.\nCollect the supernatant and remove a 5 μL aliquot to determine the protein concentration by Bradford protein assay.",
    "Repeat the wash step at least 10 times until the flow through supernatant has no detectable proteins.\nNote: It is important that the resin is washed adequately to remove non-specific proteins and maintain the deacetylase efficacy.\nNote: The Bradford protein assay is performed according to the Quick Start Bradford Protein Assay Instruction Manual at https://www.bio-rad.com/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/4110065A.pdf[href=https://www.bio-rad.com/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/4110065A.pdf].\nAfter washing, add 5 mL of ice-cold Ni-NTA elution buffer containing 1× protease inhibitor cocktail to the Ni-NTA resin. Suspend the resin and allow the elution buffer to flow down.\nAlternatives: If a gravity flow column is not available, resin can be separated from the eluate by centrifugation at 135 ×g for 3 min at 4°C.\nCollect the elution buffer containing the recombinant SIRT6 protein.\nConcentrate the eluted SIRT6 protein by ultrafiltration (10 K).\nInsert the Amicon® Ultra-15 mL device into one of the provided microcentrifuge tubes.\nAdd 5 mL of elution buffer containing recombinant SIRT6 protein to the Amicon® Ultra filter device.\nPlace the capped filter device into the centrifuge rotor, aligning the cap strap toward the center of the rotor.\nCentrifuge the device at 7,000 ×g for 15 min at 4°C.\nCollect the concentrated SIRT6 protein from the Ultra filter device into a fresh 1.5-mL tube.\nNote: Prolong the centrifugation time until the final volume of SIRT6 protein is approximately 1 mL.\nNote: A 50-μL aliquot of the supernatant can be collected to check the protein purity, and a 50-μL aliquot of resin can be saved to check elution efficiency. Both samples can be stored at −20°C.\nFurther purify SIRT6 protein by size exclusion chromatography.\nEquilibrate a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) with 36 mL of PBS at 4°C.\nLoad 1 mL of protein sample onto the column at 4°C.",
    "Elute the protein with 25 mL of PBS at a flow rate at 0.5 mL/min at 4°C.\nCollect the peak fractions from 11.5 mL to 14 mL at 4°C.\nPool the fractions and store on ice.\nNote: The Superdex 75 10/300 GL column is suitable for the purification of proteins with molecular weights ranging from 3 kDa to 70 kDa and is therefore suitable for the purification of His-SIRT6 with a molecular weight of approximately 40 kDa.\nMeasure the protein concentration by Bradford protein assay.\nIf necessary, concentrate the protein to 1–1.3 mg/mL by ultrafiltration (10 K).\nInsert the Amicon® Ultra-0.5 device into one of the provided microcentrifuge tubes.\nAdd up to 500 μL of sample to the Amicon® Ultra filter device and cap it.\nPlace the capped filter device into the centrifuge rotor, aligning the cap strap toward the center of the rotor.\nSpin the device at 14,000 ×g for approximately 10–30 min at 4°C.\nRemove the assembled device from the centrifuge and separate the ultra-filter device from the microcentrifuge tube.\nMeasure the protein concentrations by Bradford protein assay.\nNote: The centrifugation step should be required if the original protein concentration is low. If the protein concentration is higher than 1.3 mg/mL, the protein should be diluted with PBS to avoid precipitation.\nStore the SIRT6 protein in aliquots (5–10 μL) in 200-μL tubes on ice and snap-freeze in liquid nitrogen. After 5 min, transfer the protein aliquots to −80°C for storage.\nNote: A 10-μL aliquot can be used to check protein purity by SDS-PAGE and CBB staining (related to troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nPause point: The SIRT6 protein can be stored at −80°C for up to 6 months.\nPreparation of the Flag-tagged substrate immunoprecipitate for the in vitro deacetylation assay\nTiming: 5 days",
    "This section describes the purification of Flag-ACSL5 by immunoprecipitation with Anti-FLAG® M2 Agarose Beads. To obtain a high-purity Flag-tagged protein substrate, the Flag peptide is used to competitively elute the Flag-ACSL5 from Anti-FLAG® M2 agarose beads. As E. coli cell do not contain acetylated proteins, the purification of substrates of interest must be performed in a transcription and translation system that mimics the eukaryotic processes to allow post-translational modification of the target protein. In this protocol, we use a transient overexpression system in mammalian cells.\nSeed 7 × 106 HCT116 cells in a 15-cm dish (approximately 30% confluence) containing 20 mL of DMEM with 10% (v/v) FBS. Incubate the cells overnight at 37°C to approximately 50% confluence.\nAlternatives: Other cell lines, such as HEK293 and HepG2, could be used depending on the expression level and function of substrates of interest.\nNote: The cell number can be expanded to increase the yield of substrate proteins. If so, the subsequent reagents should also be scaled up by the same ratio.\nTransfect the Flag-ACSL5 plasmid using transfection reagent.\nNote: This step should be performed under sterile conditions.\nDilute 15 μg of plasmid using 750 μL of serum-free Opti-MEM medium and mix gently for 10 s.\nNote: The amount of the transfected plasmid can vary depending on the host cells and the backbone expression efficacy.\nDilute 45 μL of transfection reagent using 750 μL of serum-free Opti-MEM medium and mix gently for 10 s.\nCombine the transfection reagent solution and plasmid solution. Vortex for 10 s, and incubate for 10 min at room temperature (approximately 20°C).\nAdd the transfection mixture to the dish containing cells and mix gently by rocking the dish back and forth.\nCritical: It is very important to add the transfection mixture to the cells carefully and in a dropwise manner.",
    "Incubate the cells at 37°C with 5% CO2. Change culture media after 4–6 h.\nAlternatives: Other transfection reagents, for example Lipofectamine 2000, could be used.\nAfter incubation for 48 h, harvest the cells by centrifugation.\nDiscard the culture media and wash the cells with 5 mL of ice-cold PBS. Discard the PBS.\nAdd 3 mL of ice-cold PBS into the dish. Scrape the cells off the surface and collect the cells into two 1.5-mL tubes on ice.\nCentrifuge the cells at 125 ×g for 5 min at 4°C and remove the supernatant.\nAlternatives: If preferred, trypsin could be used to detach the cells from the surface.\nResuspend the cell pellet with 1 mL of ice-cold PBS per tube and collect the cells by centrifugation at 125 ×g for 5 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant.\nNote: Ensure that the cells do not dry out before adding PBS in steps 11 and 12 and proceed immediately to step 13 to prevent experiment failure.\nLyse the cells in 1.5 mL of RIPA buffer containing 1× protease inhibitor cocktail per tube for 30 min on ice.\nNote: The protease inhibitor cocktail must be added immediately before use.\nNote: We applied 3 mL of protein extraction buffer for a 90% confluent 15-cm plate of HCT116 cells; however, the amount of lysis buffer applied is dependent on the size of the cell pellet.\nCentrifuge the cell lysate at 12,000 ×g for 10 min at 4°C. Collect and combine the supernatant in an ice-cold tube.",
    "Note: If the substrate protein of interest is located mainly in the chromatin fraction, a sonication step (6 cycles of 5 s ON and 5 s OFF with 35% power) might be needed before centrifugation. Information regarding the main location of a protein can be obtained at: https://www.uniprofoodservice.com/[href=https://www.uniprofoodservice.com/]. Since ACSL5 is mainly cytoplasmic, no sonication step is required in this protocol.\nEquilibrate the Anti-FLAG® M2 agarose beads.\nEquilibrate 40 μL of Anti-FLAG® M2 agarose beads with 1 mL of ice-cold PBS in a fresh 1.5-mL tube and then centrifuge at 100 ×g for 1 min at 4°C.\nCarefully discard the supernatant to avoid disturbing the beads.\nRepeat this step twice.\nNote: This equilibration step should be performed at 4°C or on ice.\nAdd the equilibrated agarose beads to the HCT116 cell lysate and incubate overnight (approximately 16 h) at 4°C with end-over-end mixing.\nNote: The incubation time can be shortened to 4 h at 4°C if necessary; however, overnight incubation increases the recovery of target proteins.\nAlternatives: An input control without incubation with agarose beads should be saved to confirm the successful overexpression of target protein if the target protein is not detected or has a low purity after immunoprecipitation.\nCentrifuge the agarose beads at 100 ×g for 1 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nWash the agarose beads.\nResuspend the agarose beads in 1 mL of RIPA buffer containing a 1× protease inhibitor cocktail and incubate at 4°C for 5 min with end-over-end mixing.\nCentrifuge the agarose beads at 100 ×g for 1 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nRepeat the wash step a further three times.\nNote: This wash step can be repeated an additional 1–2 times if there are many non-specific interacting proteins.",
    "Dilute 100 μL of the 3× Flag peptide stock solution using 200 μL of TBS to achieve a final concentration of 100 μg/mL.\nAdd 200 μL of 1× Flag peptide to the agarose beads to elute the Flag-ACSL5 overnight (approximately 16 h) at 4°C with end-over-end mixing.\nCentrifuge the agarose beads at 100 ×g for 1 min at 4°C. Carefully collect the supernatant containing Flag-ACSL5 into a fresh 1.5-mL tube to avoid disturbing the gel pellet.\nConcentrate the Flag-ALSC5 protein.\nDivide the Flag-ACSL5 protein sample into 40 μL per 1.5-mL tube.\nCentrifuge the 1.5 mL tube with cap opening for 30 min at 30°C using a vacuum dryer.\nCombine the Flag-ACSL5 proteins to a total volume of approximately 40 μL.\nNote: The volume of 40 μL is an empiric value that may vary depending on the protein concentration measured based on an appropriate concentration of 0.5 μg/μL.\nMeasure the protein concentration by Bradford assay. A concentration of 0.5 μg/μL is appropriate.\nAlternatives: Other methods of measuring the protein concentration, such as BCA protein assay, can be used.\nNote: If the protein concentration is too low or too high, the duration of the centrifugation in step 22 can be longer or shorter, respectively.\nAliquot the purified protein at 5–10 μL per tube and store at −80°C prior to use. Avoid repeated freezing and thawing.\nNote: A 10-μL of aliquot from each collection can be removed to check protein purity by SDS-PAGE and CBB staining (related to troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nPause point: The purified ACSL5 protein can be stored at −80°C for up to 6 months.\nIn vitro deacetylation assay\nTiming: 3 h",
    "This section describes the deacetylation assay using the purified SIRT6 and substrate proteins. This protocol can be used to study potential SIRT6 deacetylation substrates, the undiscovered SIRT6-mediated deacetylation sites of substrate and the effect of SIRT6 mutations on its activity. For the first purpose, the purified SIRT6 is incubated with Flag-tagged substrate proteins in the presence of PA and NAD+ (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]); For the second purpose, a set of mutated substrates are incubated with SIRT6 in the presence of PA and NAD+ (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]); For the third purpose, mutated SIRT6 (MT) is incubated with a known substrate, such as ACSL5 (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2570_11.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2570_12.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2570_13.csv\nPrepare the in vitro deacetylation assay mix for each reaction in a 200-μL tube on ice as described in the key assay buffers and solutions[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.1] section. Gently mix the reaction by pipetting up and down and microfuge briefly (1–2 s).\nNote: The reaction buffer should be prepared immediately before use. The two purified proteins should be added last. All the reactions should be prepared to a final volume of 40 μL by the addition of ddH2O. Avoid generating bubbles when mix the reaction.\nNote: To expand the loading amounts for SDS-PAGE, the reaction system volume should be scaled up by the same ratio.\nCritical: The protease inhibitor cocktail should be prepared immediately before use and freeze-thawing should be avoided after the protease inhibitors are added.\nNote: Since NAD+ is required for SIRT6 deacetylase activity, a group without NAD+ should be included as a negative control.\nIncubate the reaction system for 2 h at 37°C in a heat-block with shaking function (100 rpm).\nNote: Shaking can be omitted if the heat-block does not have this function.",
    "Critical: To ensure consistent incubation times, all reaction mixtures must be prepared on ice and transferred simultaneously to the pre-warmed (37°C) heat-block.\nAdd 10 μL of 5× SDS loading dye to stop the reaction, and then denature the samples in a heat-block at 100°C for 10 min.\nNote: To ensure complete denaturation, the heat-block should be pre-warmed to 100°C.\nSDS-PAGE and Western blotting\nTiming: 2 days\nThis section describes detection of the acetylation level of the substrate by Western blotting using antibodies against pan-lysine acetylation and Flag-tag. An anti-SIRT6 blot must be included to confirm equal amounts of SIRT6 (WT or H133Y) are used in each deacetylation reaction. The protocol describes the steps for using a pan-lysine acetylation antibody, although we have also used an antibody that detects site-specific acetylation of lysine 361 in ACSL5.\nLoad 15 μL of each denatured sample onto one SDS-PAGE gel for separation.\nNote: Several SDS-PAGE gels can be prepared for detection using multiple antibodies.\nNote: The percentage of gel can be modified depending on the molecular weight of substrate protein. In this protocol using ACSL5 as the specific SIRT6 substrate, 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel was used to detect total and pan-acetylated levels of ACSL5. 10% SDS-PAGE gel was used to detect SIRT6.\nTransfer the separated proteins to a nitrocellulose filter membrane.\nAlternatives: Other membranes, for example polyvinylidene fluoride, can be used.\nImmunoblotting (related to troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).\nIncubate each membrane in 5% BSA/PBS for 1 h at room temperature (approximately 20°C).\nIncubate each membrane with anti-Flag (dilution 1/2,000 in 5% BSA/PBS), anti-pan-acetylated lysine (dilution 1/1,000 in 5% BSA/PBS) or anti-SIRT6 (dilution 1/1,000 in 5% BSA/PBS) overnight (approximately 16 h) at 4°C.\nNote: If a site-specific acetylation antibody (for example, H3K9ac) is used, this will generate a more informative readout.",
    "Note: Western blotting using an antibody against Flag-tag is required to confirm equal loading of the total substrate protein.\nWash the membrane three times with TBST for 5 min at room temperature (approximately 20°C).\nIncubate the membrane with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (dilution, 1/5,000 in 5% BSA/PBS) for 1 h at room temperature (approximately 20°C).\nAlternatives: Other secondary antibodies, for example HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, should be used depending on the corresponding primary antibody.\nWash the membrane three times with TBST for 10 min at room temperature (approximately 20°C).\nNote: All the incubation and washing steps should be performed with shaking (100 rpm).\nExpose the membranes using Immobilon Western HRP Substrate.\nAcquire images using a Chemiluminescent imager."
