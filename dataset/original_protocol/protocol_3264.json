Mosquito rearing is\n      required to study a range of vector borne diseases; our work is optimized\n      for growing Anopheles mosquitoes to be infected with\n      Plasmodium yoelii, berghei and falciparum. Traditional\n      rearing involves regular draining of individual pans into a sieve to thin\n      larvae and refresh water.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] We have improved\n      upon the manual method by creating an array of large aluminum pans with\n      fixed electronically actuated valves, supported on a mobile frame with a\n      trough containing a pump for collecting draining water. This enables the\n      system to be quickly emptied or refilled, reducing the workload and\n      increasing consistency compared to manual methods. Our system consists of\n      six 4′ x 6′ x 4″ aluminum pans. The size of the pupation station,\n      including pan numbers and dimensions, can be tailored to meet the needs of\n      individual insectaries.\n    \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3034-Fig1.jpg\n          Figure 1.

In this new setup, the cotton ball is packed into a small\n      tube filled with sugar water so it can be continually remoistened (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).

Approximately half of the\n            cotton ball should stick outside the tube.\n          \n            When placing the sugar tube on a cage of mosquitoes, lay the tube at\n            an angle against the rim so that the cotton ball lays flush with the\n            netting and the back end of the tube sticks up."
