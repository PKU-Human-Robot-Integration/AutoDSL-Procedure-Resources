  "procedures": [
    "The procedure is ideally suited to extract and quantify polyP from gram-negative PPK-containing bacteria, including P. aeruginosa, which accumulate polyP under stress, e.g., sublethal concentration of hypohalous acids or nutrient starvation (for details regarding growth and stress treatment, see Ault-Riché et al., 1998; Groitl et al., 2017).Prepare samples for the extraction of polyPNote: As GITC is considered as being moderately toxic, keep separate GITC waste container for tips and flow-through.Collect bacterial cells sufficient to yield 100-300 μg of total cellular protein (approximately 1 ml of P. aeruginosa culture at OD600 = 1), and spin down cells at 13,000 x g, 4 °C.Discard supernatant.Resuspend cell pellets in 0.25 ml GITC lysis buffer.Incubate the samples in a Thermomixer for 10 min at 95 °C without mixing.Take 20 μl samples for determining the protein concentration (see Step B2).Store samples at -80 °C after cooling down to RT until further procedure. Degradation is no concern as GITC denatures proteins including proteases.Note: We always processed the samples within 7 days. Determine the protein concentration of the samplesPrepare a standard curve by dissolving BSA in GITC lysis buffer to a final concentration of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5 or 2 μg/μl.Mix 195 μl Bradford Reagent with 5 μl of the BSA standard or 5 μl of the lysed samples, and incubate for 5-10 min at room temperature (RT) in microcentrifuge tubes. Use triplicates for each sample.Transfer samples into 96-well clear plates with flat bottom and measure absorbance at 595 nm in the Fluostar Omega Plate Reader.Calculate the protein concentration as described in the Data analysis section. Samples will be normalized at the end.Extract polyPThaw samples from Step A6 and vortex to mix. Add subsequently to the samples: 15 μl 10% w/v SDS, 0.",
    "5 ml 95% v/v ethanol, and 5 μl glassmilk (see Recipes) and vortex in between.Transfer samples to silica membrane spin columns and spin down in microcentrifuge for 3 min at 3,000 x g, RT. Note that we observed a pellet formation in the flow-through at velocities higher than 3,000 x g.Discard flow-through.Add 0.75 ml NW-Buffer (see Recipes).Spin down for 3 min at 3,000 x g at RT and discard flow-through.Repeat Steps C5 and C6.Dry samples by centrifugation at 11,000 x g for 3 min at RT.Transfer column to a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.Add 50 μl Elution buffer to the column, incubate for 15 min at RT and elute polyP by centrifugation at 11,000 x g for 3 min at RT.Samples can be stored at -80 °C.Note: Processing should be done within 1-3 days.Convert polyP into ATPThaw samples from Step C11 and vortex to mix.Prepare two PPK Assay Master Mixes according to the number of samples. Master mix I (+PPK) contains 50 nM of E. coil PPK, whereas master mix II (-PPK) does not. The reactions without PPK are used to correct for cellular ATP that was extracted during the process. The following volumes refer to the amount required for one sample. PPK Assay Master Mix I (+ PPK) (total 20 μl per sample):table:",

Modify as necessary for the instrument you have available. Take 10 μl aliquots of the PPK-digested samples (incubated in PPK Assay Master Mix I) and undigested samples (incubated in PPK Assay Master Mix II), and transfer them into wells of white flat bottom 96-well plate.Prepare Luciferase Reaction Master Mix as follows and keep it at RT.Luciferase Reaction Master Mix (total 10 ml):table:\n﻿0,1\n0.5 ml,20-fold Luciferase Reaction Buffer\n10 μl,1 M DTT (final concentration of 1 mM) (Thaw on ice)\n1 ml,Luciferin working solution (final concentration of 100 μM)\n1 μl,\"luciferase [stock concentration of 244 μM (may vary among batches), final concentration of 25 nM]\"\n8.5 ml,H2O",
    "Note: The reaction is very temperature sensitive, therefore do not store the reaction master mix on ice. Because luciferase loses its activity quickly, use the reaction master mix within 15-20 min of preparation. Prime injector of Omega plate reader with 2 ml Luciferase Reaction Master Mix.Set the temperature of the Omega plate reader to 25 °C and the gain to 3,000 (This is specific to the OMEGA plate reader and may vary in other plate readers).Inject 90 μl of Luciferase Reaction Master Mix to each sample, mix for 10 sec fast mixing and measure luminescence over 2-3 min. The length of each cycle depends on the amount of samples.Measure the PPK-digested (incubated with PPK-Assay Master Mix I) samples in the same order as the undigested samples (incubated with PPK-Assay Master Mix II). Measure luminescence over 2-3 min.When finished, wash injector by priming with 4 ml dH2O."
