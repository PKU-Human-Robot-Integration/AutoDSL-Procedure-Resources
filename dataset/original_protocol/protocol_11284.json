    "All the animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and performed in accordance with NIH guidelines.\n1. Preparation of OP9/DLL1 Cells for Co-culture with iPSC\nCulture OP9/DLL1 cells in OP9 media (α-minimum essential medium [α-MEM] + 20% non-heat inactivated fetal bovine serum [FBS] + 1x penicillin-streptomycin + ascorbic acid [50 ng/mL] and mono-thioglycerol [100 nM]) at 37 °C. When OP9/DLL1 cells reach 80–95% confluency, wash once with 1x magnesium, calcium, and phenol red free phosphate buffered saline (hereafter referred to as PBS).\nAdd 4 mL of 0.05% trypsin and incubate for 5 min at 37 °C. Then add 4 mL of OP9 media, dissociate the cell layer by pipetting to make a single cell suspension.\nTransfer the cell suspension into a 50 mL conical tube through a 100 µm cell strainer. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C, aspirate the supernatant, and resuspend in 12 mL of OP9 media.\nPlate 2 mL of OP9/DLL1 cell suspension onto a new 10 cm cell-culture Petri dish and add additional 8 mL of OP9 media. Repeat passage every 2–3 days.\nNOTE: The quality of the FBS and culture conditions are critical to maintain the expansion of OP9/DLL1 cells without losing their ability to support iPSC differentiation. Therefore, it is recommended to pre-evaluate the lot of FBS and passage consistently at 80% confluency to prevent cell differentiation and senescence. It is also important to make enough frozen stock of OP9/DLL1 cells and thaw a new stock every 4–6 weeks.\n2. In Vitro Differentiation of iPSC into Immature T Cells\nOn day 0, begin iPSC co-culture on OP9/DLL1 confluent dishes.",
    "Harvest iPSC as a single cell suspension by trypsinization (5 min in 0.05% trypsin at 37 °C), collect the cells, and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend cells at 1.0 x 105 iPSC per 10 mL of OP9 media. Plate 1.0 x 105 iPSC onto a confluent OP9/DLL1 10 cm dish.\nNOTE: OP9/DLL1 10 cm dishes are used for iPSC differentiation when they reach 90–100% confluency. Differences in confluency can affect the efficiency of iPSC differentiation.\nOn day 3, aspirate old media and replace with 10 mL of fresh OP9 media.\nOn day 6, passage cells.\nWash each 10 cm confluent OP9 dish with 10 mL of PBS. Add 3 mL of 0.05% trypsin per dish and incubate for 3–5 min at room temperature (RT).\nAdd 4 mL of OP9 media and collect cells by gentle pipetting. Pass cells through a 100 µm cell strainer and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard supernatant.\nResuspend cells in 10 mL of differentiation media (OP9 media with 5 ng/mL mouse Flt3 ligand [FLT3L] and 5 ng/mL mouse IL-7) and plate cell suspension onto a new 10 cm OP9/DLL1 confluent dish.\nOn day 9, aspirate old media and replace with 10 mL of fresh differentiation media.\nOn day 11 when cardiomyocytes are observed in iPSC colonies, mechanically detach non-adherent cells by pipetting and filter through a 100 µm cell strainer. Spin at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend in 24 mL of differentiation media. Plate iPSC into a confluent OP9/DLL1 6-well plate (4 mL/well).\nOn day 15, collect all non-adherent cells and filter through a 40 µm cell strainer.\nSpin at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.",
    "Continue passaging non-adherent cells every 3–4 days by repeating step 2.5.1.\n3. 3D Thymic Organ Culture to Generate iTE\nHarvest mouse fetal thymic lobes and deploy of endogenous lymphocytes by deoxyguanosine (dGUO) treatment as previously described16.\nOn day 7 of dGUO treatment, take four new 10 cm dishes and fill each with 20 mL of complete media (Rosswell Park Memorial Institute Media 1640 [RPMI 1640] + 10% FBS + 1x L-alanyl-L-glutamine + 1x sodium pyruvate + 1x minimum essential medium with non-essential amino acids (MEM-NEAA) + 1x penicillin-streptomycin + [1:1000] 2-mercapto ethanol).\nTransfer all nitrocellulose membranes with thymic lobes into one 10 cm dish. Detach the individual lobes from the membrane with forceps, allowing them to be submerged in media. Discard the membranes. Incubate for 1 h at RT.\nTransfer the thymic lobes to a new 10 cm dish with complete media and incubate for 1 h at RT. Repeat this step 2 more times.\nUsing forceps, fix the thymic lobes to the dish (one at a time), and with the other hand make a 100–200 µm deep incision in the center and extending half the diameter of the lobe to facilitate T cell progenitor migration into the lobe.\nTransfer the thymic lobes to a new 10 cm dish filled with complete differentiation media (complete media + 5 ng/mL mouse IL-7 + 5 ng/mL mouse FLT3L + 5 ng/mL SCF).\nOptionally, if using 3D culture plates with lower and upper level grids, fill both grids with sterile PBS to prevent the evaporation and drying of the hanging drops.\nTransfer 30 µL of complete media containing one dGuo-treated thymic lobe from step 3.6 into each well of 3D culture plate.",
    "Collect non-adherent T lineage cells (iPSC-derived immature T cells) from OP9/DLL1 co-culture (days 16-21) (step 2.6.2) and resuspend at 2–5 x 103 T lineage cells per 20 µL media.\nAdd 20 µL of T lineage cell suspension to each thymic lobe in the 3D culture plate. Incubate overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2. \nSet the P200 pipet to 30 µL and aspirate the media after pipetting several times from each well to remove all the cells surrounding the thymic lobes. Discard media and add 30 µL of complete media. Repeat this procedure 5–7 times to remove any extra immature T cells which does not migrate into the lobes. Change 25–30 µL of media daily thereafter.\nConfirm the formation of a halo of iPSC-derived thymic emigrants (iTE) around the lobes beginning on day 4–5 by light microscopy.\nCollect iTE daily by pipetting media without lobe disruption. Change media every day and continue collection up to approximately 12 days.\nHarvested iTE are ready to use for molecular analyses (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 5) or in vivo transplantation experiments.\n4. Preparation of Antigen Presenting Cells (APC)\nSacrifice a C57BL/6 mouse by cervical dislocation and place onto a lab soaker mat as described above.\nRemove the spleen and place it onto a 100 µm cell strainer. Compress the spleen onto the strainer using a 12 mL syringe plunger to make a single cell suspension.\nTransfer the cell suspension through a sterile 40 µm cell strainer. Centrifuge the suspension at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet the cells.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 2 mL of ammonium-chloride-potassium (ACK) lysis buffer to exclude red blood cells (RBC). Incubate for 5 min at RT.",
    "Quench the ACK lysis buffer by adding 10 mL of PBS. Pellet the cells by centrifugation at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 10 mL of complete media and transfer to a 10 cm sterile Petri dish.\nIrradiate splenocytes with 3500 rad using an irradiation device (γ-radiation) to prevent cell proliferation.\nImmediately return the irradiated cells to a 37 °C incubator and culture overnight.\nUse irradiated cells as APC or freeze in cell banker.\n5. Pulsing APC with Antigen\nCount live irradiated APC using a Neubauer hemocytometer and trypan blue dye. Incubate APC with peptides (hgp100) or nucleoprotein for 30 min at 37 °C.\nWash APC twice with 10 mL of PBS to remove any extra peptide.\nCount iTE and mix with APC in a 1:1 ratio in complete media with 100 IU IL-2 and 5 ng/mL IL-7. Aliquot 100 µL of the mixture of cells (total concentration: 1 x 106 cells/mL) into each well of an ultra-low attachment U bottom 96 well plate and culture for 48 h at 37 °C.\nAfter 48 h, transfer cells to a new plate using a multichannel pipette and passage every 2–3 days thereafter.\nOn day 3, analyze the cytokine secretion profile by staining the cells with intracellular antibody and analyze by flow cytometry (Figure 3).\nAdd 0.67 µL/mL of protein transport inhibitor (e.g., GolgiStop) and incubate at 37 °C for 6 h to enhance the intracellular accumulation of cytokines. Wash with 10 mL of PBS.\nResuspend cells in 3 mL of cold (4 °C) PBS and slowly add 1 mL of cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution.",
    "After 10 min, spin down cells at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C, discard supernatant and wash with 10 mL of PBS.\nResuspend cells in 1 mL PBS + 1% FBS + 0.1% nonionic surfactant, and place in 4 °C for 10–15 min.\nAdd antibodies, protect samples from light and place in 4 °C for 30 min.\nSpin down cells at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C, discard supernatant, and wash with 10 mL of PBS.\nSpin down cells at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspend cells in 1 mL of PBS. Cells are ready to be analyzed in a flow cytometer."
