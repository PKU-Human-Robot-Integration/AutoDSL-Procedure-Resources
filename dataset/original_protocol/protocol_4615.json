    "InfectionDay 1:Seed 2.0 x 107 bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) in 145 mm dishes with 30 ml BMDM + PS media, 3 plates for each bacterial strain being analyzed. Pick a bacterial colony from a BHI plate and inoculate into 10 ml of BHI medium (repeat for each sample), incubate at 30 °C incubator, slanted without shaking overnight.Day 2:Pre-warm BMDM no PS medium and PBS at 37 °C.Wash macrophage monolayer twice with 25 ml of warmed PBS to remove the antibiotics. Add 30 ml fresh medium.Wash 1.5 ml of overnight bacterial cultures twice with PBS. Infect macrophages at MOI of 90:1 (in favor for the bacteria) for wild-type L. monocytogenes 10403S. When mutants defected in intracellular growth are used, consider increasing the MOI.Infect each plate 15 min apart (same as in step A5).Following 0.5 h incubation (in respect to each sample infection time), wash monolayers twice with 30 ml PBS. Add 30 ml pre-warmed BMDM no PS medium.At 1 h post infection, add 30 µl of gentamicin (1:1,000) to kill extracellular bacteria.Prepare filter apparatus and ice-cold RNase-free water.At 6 h post infection, harvest the bacteria. Treat each plate individually.Wash monolayers with PBS once.Add 20 ml of ice-cold RNase-free water. Using a cell scraper, scrape and lyse cells by pushing the liquid in front of the scraper.Collect by pipetting the lysed monolayer in a 50ml conical tube. Vortex for 30 sec. Centrifuge 2,000 rpm (720 x g) /3 min/ 4 °C.Pass supernatant through filter apparatus. Using tweezers, put the filter membrane in 15 ml conical tubes, loosely rolled. Immediately freeze filters by dipping the 15 ml tubes in liquid nitrogen.Prepare the filter apparatus for the next sample and repeat.Nucleic acids extractionDay 3:Prepare 1:1 mix of acidified phenol:chloroform, 400 µl for each sample.",
    "Mix in a separate tube, and then expel the resulting aqueous layer aspirated off. Thaw your filter-containing tubes on ice. Insert each tube fully into ice.To each filter-containing tube add 650 µl AE buffer. Add buffer to all tubes. Working quickly, vigorously vortex your filter containing tube so that the filter whisks to the periphery of the tube and the buffer fully washes over the filter. It may be necessary to additionally vortex the tube while inverted to fully wash the bacteria off the filter. Always keep tube cold by placing it back on ice. Repeat for all tubes. It may be useful to spin-down the suspension shortly (1 min/750 rpm/60 x g) at the end of the process. Transfer the bacteria-containing buffer to the 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube containing 40 µl of 10% SDS and 400 µl of phenol/chloroform mix. Repeat for all tubes. It may be necessary to spin down tubes shortly (1 min/750 rpm) to get residual buffer from the filter.Place all of your tubes in the multi-tube vortex device, and vortex at full speed for 10 min.Incubate the tubes at 65 °C heat block for 10 min.Centrifuge at maximum speed (14,000 RPM / 20,817 x g) for 5 min.Transfer the aqueous layer (about 400 µl) from each tube to the 1.5 ml tube containing 40 µl 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 1.0 ml 100% ethanol. Vortex each tube thoroughly.Incubate your sample at -80 °C 1 h.Centrifuge at 4 °C for 20 min at maximum speed (14,000 RPM / 20,817 x g).Carefully aspirate off the ethanol from each tube. Add 500 µl cold 70% ethanol to each sample and vortex thoroughly. Centrifuge at 4 °C for 20 min at maximum speed.Carefully aspirate off the ethanol from each tube.",
    "Dry your samples for approximately 2 min in a speed-Vac device without heating. It is critical not to over-dry your samples.To each sample, add 25 µl RNase-free water. Incubate at room temperature for 20 min. Carefully vortex and spin-down.Analyze the RNA concentration in the samples using the NanoDrop. Expect to extract about 0.5-1 µg/plate. You can unite the technical replicates at this stage.DNase treatmentSet reaction:table:",

Centrifuge at 4 °C for 20 min at maximum speed.Carefully aspirate off the ethanol from each tube. In a speed-Vac without heating, dry your samples for approximately 2 min. It is critical not to over-dry your samples.Add 12 µl of RNase-free water, incubate for 2 min at room temperature, vortex, and spin-down. Keep the RNA on ice.Analyze the RNA concentration in the samples using the NanoDrop. Expect to extract about 100 ng/sample."
