    "1 Plant growth and materials collection\nEnsure that Arabidopsis seeds are sterilized in 70% ethanol for 10 min and sowed on the agar plates, which were prepared with one-half-strength Murashige and Skoog nutrients.\nIncubate the plates containing Arabidopsis seeds under dark at 4 °C for 48 h, and then transfer them into a controlled growth chamber under 16 h light of 55 µmol m-2 s-1 at 22 °C and 8 h dark at 20 °C.\nHarvest 100 mg of 2-week seedlings (fresh weight) and freeze in liquid nitrogen for metabolites extraction.\n\t​CAUTION: Researchers should appropriately wear gloves, protective glasses, and a lab coat to avoid the human-tissue contamination during the materials collection.\n2 Nucleosides/Nucleotides extraction\nGround 100 mg of frozen plant tissues with 7-8 steel beads in a pre-cold mixer mill for 5 min at a frequency of 60 Hz.\nPrepare the extraction solution, which contains methanol, acetonitrile, and water in a ratio of 2:2:1.\nResuspend the homogenized materials (including most metabolites but not proteins) with 1 mL of extraction solution.\nCentrifuge the resulting solution at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.\nTransfer 0.5 mL of the suspension to a new 1.5 mL tube and freeze in the liquid nitrogen.\nEvaporate the frozen sample in a freeze dyer and resuspend in 0.1 mL of 5% acetonitrile and 95% water.\nCentrifuge the resulting solution (0.1 mL) at 40,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Load the supernatant in a vial for LC-MS/MS measurement.\n3 LC-MS/MS measurement\nPrepare a 10 mM ammonium acetate buffer by dissolving 1.1 g of ammonium acetate in 2 L of double deionized water (Mobile phase A). Adjust the pH to 9.5 by 10% ammonium and acetate acid.",
    "Prepare 2 L of ultrapure 100% methanol (Mobile phase B1) for nucleosides measurement. Also, prepare 2 L of ultrapure 100% acetonitrile (Mobile phase B2) for nucleotides measurement.\nInject 0.02 mL of pre-treated metabolites extraction of each sample from step 2.7 into a HPLC system with binary pumps (LC) coupled with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS).\n\tCAUTION: HPLC system employs a C18 column (50 x 4.6 mm, particle size 5 µm; working at 25 °C) buffering with mobile phase A and B1 (Figure 1A) for the nucleosides separation and use a porous graphitic carbon (PGC) column (50 x 4.6 mm, particle size 5 µm; working at 25 °C) with mobile phase A and B2 (Figure 1B) for the nucleotides separation. Each sample was injected three times for the technical replication.\nProgram the method as shown in Table 1 for the C18 column, and the method as shown in Table 2 for the PGC column. Set a flow rate of 0.65 mL min-1.\n\tNOTE: The mass transitions (Table 3) were monitored by mass spectrometer. The mass spectrum analysis conditions of eight nucleosides and five nucleotides containing canonical ones and modified ones are listed in Table 3.\nRecord the peak areas of every target compound (Figure 1).\n4 Generation of the standard calibration curves\nPool six sample extractions together, which were produced following the description in section 2, and vortex it. Then, aliquot it to six extractions (same volume) again to get each background.\nAdd six different concentrations of each standard to these six extractions, respectively, and inject them one by one following step 3.3.\nRecord the peak areas of each standard at different concentrations via the mass transitions as described in steps 3.4 and 3.5.\nPlot the peak area against the nominal concentration of each standard to generate a six-point curve.",
    "NOTE: The peak areas of nucleosides/nucleotides recorded in the step 3.5 should fall in the range of standard calibration curves.\nCalculate the equation of a straight line for each standard compound: Y = aX + b\n5 Metabolites' quantification\nCalculate the metabolites' contents using the peak area recorded in step 3.5 and the equation from step 4.5.\nSubscription Required.
