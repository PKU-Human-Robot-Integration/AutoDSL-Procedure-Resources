    "pSUC2 vector constructionDNA fragments that code the predicted signal peptides and the following additional two amino acids were amplified and introduced into pSUC2 using EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites (Figure 1). The DNA sequences around enzyme cutting site are as follows and the sequences of sites are underlined.EcoRI: 5’ TCCAAGCTCGGAATTTTAATTAAGAATTC 3’XhoI: 5’ CTCGAGGTTCTCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTAT 3’imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180503/20180503024054_9336.jpgFigure 1. The vector information of pSUC2. This map was modified from Jacobs (Jacobs et al., 1997).Confirm the positive transformants by PCR with pSUC2 vector-specific primers as follows, which should be further confirmed by sequencing. pSUC2F: GGTGTGAAGTGGACCAAAGGTCTApSUC2R: CCTCGTCATTGTTCTCGTTCCCTTIn this study, we use the recombinant plasmid that contains Avr1b signal peptide from Phytophthora sojae that was demonstrated to be functional (Dou et al., 2008; Song et al., 2015).Transformation of plasmid DNA into yeast cellsStreak an YPDA agar plate with the YTK12 yeast cells from a frozen yeast stock, incubate the plate upside down at 30 °C for 2-3 days until colonies appear. Note: YPD medium also can be used, although yeast can get a better situation on YPDA. If there are no special instructions, the following steps are done at the room temperature.Inoculate one colony (diameter 2-3 mm) into 3 ml YPDA liquid medium in a sterile test tube, incubate at 30 °C for 16-18 h with shaking at 220 rpm and measure the OD values at 600 nm to get suspension with OD value more than 0.6 (OD600 > 0.6).Pipette about 1.5 ml of cell suspension into a 2 ml tube and centrifuge the cells at 12,000 x g for 1 min at room temperature.Discard the supernatant and re-suspend the cells with 1.5 ml sterile distilled water or TE buffer.Centrifuge the cells at 12,000 x g for 1 min and discard the supernatant.",
    "For each transformation, add reagents in a 2 ml tube as following order and keep on ice: 34 μl plasmid DNA and sterile water (1 μg Plasmid DNA will be enough for transformation); 50 μl single-stranded carrier DNA (2.0 mg/ml) and mix well; 36 μl 1.0 M LiAc and mix well; 240 μl 50% (w/v) PEG 3350 and vortex mix vigorously or use a sterile pipette tip to break up the cell pellet to mix thoroughly.Incubate with shaking at 220 rpm for 30 min at 30 °C.Add 1/10 of the volume DMSO and mix gently.Incubate the cell suspension at 42 °C for 15 min and mix upside down for several times during this time.Incubate on ice for 2 min. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 1 min and discard the supernatant. Add 100 μl sterile distilled water or TE buffer and re-suspend the cells with a pipette carefully.Coat the cell suspension on selective media CMD-W plate using a sterile glass rod and incubate at 30 °C for 3 days.Screening the positive yeast colonies on selective mediaAfter transformation, spread the yeast cells on CMD-W media plates.Streak the colonies to fresh CMD-W plates and incubate at 30 °C for at least 2 days.Streak the colonies to new CMD-W plates and YPRAA plates (raffinose media) and incubate for another 2-3 days at 30 °C.Color observation to detect signal peptide secretion functionThe color change is used to detect signal peptide secretion function. Streak the single transformational colony into CMD-W liquid medium, the YTK12 yeast that does not contain any plasmid DNA was cultured in YPDA liquid medium as control.Incubate with shaking at 220 rpm for 36 h at 30 °C.Pipette about 1.5 ml of cell suspension into a 2 ml tube and centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 1 min at room temperature.",
    "Discard the supernatant, add 1.5 ml sterile distilled water and vortex shock to mix vigorously.Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 1 min, discard the supernatant and add 1.5 ml sterile distilled water and vortex shock to mix well.Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 1 min and discard the supernatant.Re-suspend with 750 μl sterile distilled water, add 250 μl 10 mM acetic acid–sodium acetate buffer (pH = 4.7), 500 μl 10 % sucrose solution (w/v), incubate at 37 °C for 10 min.Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 1 min, take 100 μl of the supernatant, put into glass test tube and add 900 μl 0.1% TTC solution, incubate at room temperature for 5 min. Colorimetric change will be observed if the signal peptide is functional, while the red color will be not observed for YTK12 strain and YTK12 carrying the empty pSUC2 vector. Note: The empty pSUC2 vector also contains a non-functional sequence."
