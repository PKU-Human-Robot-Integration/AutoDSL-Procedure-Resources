    "Approval by the appropriate Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee is obtained.\n1. Anesthesia and Pre-operative Procedures\nAnesthetize male C57Bl/6 ice, aged 8 weeks, with vaporized 3% isoflurane and 0.8 L/min oxygen administered into an acrylic induction chamber.\nConfirm adequate anesthesia by lack of reaction to toe pinch. Position the mouse supine on the operation table and position a silicone mask to deliver vaporized 2 - 3% isoflurane by continuous inhalation.\nRemove ventral hair from the neck to lower abdomen using a chemical depilatory cream.\nPerform Doppler ultrasound examination prior to AVF surgery to record baseline characteristics of arterial and venous flow and vessel diameter at the areas of interest.1,2\nAttach a 1 ml syringe to a 25 G needle and load the syringe with the desired drug. Bend the needle to a 60 degree angle approximately 4 mm from the needle tip. Grasp the 25 G needle with a curved needle holder.\n2. Operative Procedures\nPrepare the incision site with a topical antiseptic and apply a surgical drape. Use sterile gloves and instruments to maintain aseptic technique throughout the surgery.\nMake a midline abdominal incision with a scalpel extending from the level of the lower liver edge to just above the pubis.\nInsert a retractor and eviscerate all bowels from the abdominal cavity toward the right side. Wrap the bowels in gauze soaked with saline. Dissect the membrane connecting the retro-peritoneum and lower colon to obtain full view of the aorta and IVC.\nDissect the infra-renal aorta and IVC from surrounding tissues, preparing for proximal and distal clamping.\nPlace a single microsurgery clip across both the proximal aorta and the proximal IVC at the level just below the left renal vein. Place a second microsurgery clip across both the distal aorta and the distal IVC.",
    "Grasp the connective tissue surrounding the aorta and rotate medially so that the dorsal surface of the aorta is slightly exposed for the arterial puncture, as described previously.1\nQuickly expose the puncture site. The puncture site will be at the caudal aspect of the vessels, approximately three quarters of the distance from the left renal vein to the aortic bifurcation. Keeping the aorta in a rotated position with the left hand, dissect the left lateral margin of the aorta so that there is ample exposure to allow puncture with the right hand. Be careful not to dissect between the aorta and the IVC.\nMaintain the aorta in a rotated position and puncture the aorta through into the IVC using a 25 G needle with an attached 1 ml syringe containing drug solution. (Figure 1A)\nInfuse the drug solution (100 - 200 µl) using the left hand. The needle can be seen through the dilated and thin IVC wall when the transparent drug solution displaces the venous blood out of the IVC (Figure 1B,C). Remain still and maintain the needle in position for 15 min.\nRemove the distal microsurgery clip to de-clamp only the distal aorta and the distal IVC.\nRemove the needle and then cover the puncture site of the aorta by pulling up adjacent retro-peritoneal tissue.\nRemove the proximal microsurgery clip to de-clamp the proximal aorta and the proximal IVC. Upon de-clamping, arterial blood is observed flowing into the IVC instead of dark venous blood flow. Keep covering the puncture hole for 1 min.\nAfter confirmation of hemostasis by observation for 30 sec without compression, return the bowels into their natural position and close the abdomen with a running suture according to your approved animal protocol. \n3. Post-operative Procedures",
    "After closure of the abdomen, discontinue anesthesia. Apply post-operative care including analgesia and wound care in accordance with instructions recommended by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. For analgesia we use buprenorphine at 0.1 mg/kg intrasmuscularly every 12 hr for 24 hr following the surgical procedures.\nOn the first day after operation, perform Doppler ultrasound to confirm patency of the AVF. In addition, measure other vessel and flow characteristics serially and compare for changes from pre-operative baseline values.1,2\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53905/53905fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. (A) Operative Photo Showing Intraluminal Delivery during AVF Surgery. Clamp the proximal and distal aorta, as well as the IVC by applying microsurgery clips. Puncture the aorta through into the IVC using a 25 G needle with attached syringe containing drug solution.

Yellow arrowheads denote the wall-to-wall diameter of the IVC. (C) A Higher Power Picture (4X magnification) of the Punctured IVC after Infusion. The needle tip (black arrow) can be seen through the gently distended and thin IVC wall (yellow arrowheads) as the transparent drug solution displaces the venous blood.Subscription Required.
