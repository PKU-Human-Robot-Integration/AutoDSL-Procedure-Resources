    "This work used existing specimens without identification of subjects and is exempt from IRB approval under 45 CFR 46.101(b)(4).\nHuman donor corneas were obtained from various eye banks across the US (see Table of Materials). Corneas were individually judged dystrophic by the eye banks based on findings such as guttae, pleomorphism, polymegathism, and/or low ECD upon specular evaluation. Figure 1 presents Trypan Blue staining in the cornea during wound creation, immediately following stripping, and after 2 weeks in culture.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63482/63482fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Diagram representing cornea during wound creation, immediately post-stripping, and after 14 days in culture as visualized by Trypan Blue. The reduction in stained area between these timepoints was measured to determine the level of healing.

Wound creation\nUsing sterile forceps, remove the cornea from media and rinse in 1x PBS to remove residual media and cell debris. After rinsing, place the cornea endothelial side up on the lid of a Petri dish.\nPipette 30 µL of Trypan Blue into a welled dish. Dip a new 4 mm biopsy punch in Trypan Blue and tap off any excess.\nUsing both hands, position the punch above the center of the cornea and lower it straight down onto the endothelial surface, applying minimal pressure.\nWithout changing the position or pressure on the cornea, shift the punch to one hand and reach for forceps with the newly freed hand. Use the forceps to hold the cornea in place while gently twisting the biopsy punch about 90° back and forth several times.\nLift the punch straight up from the cornea and set aside.\nRinse once more in 1x PBS to remove excess Trypan Blue.\n2. Descemet's stripping\nTransfer cornea on a Petri dish lid to a dissecting scope.",
    "NOTE: Do not leave cornea dry longer than 5 min. If more time is needed to complete the process, rinse again in 1x PBS to rehydrate the endothelium.\nHolding the cornea in place with curved forceps, score Descemet's membrane by lightly dragging the tip of a sharp 30 G needle along the ring of Trypan Blue left by the biopsy punch. Use minimal pressure to avoid disrupting the underlying stroma.\nWith a Sinskey hook, use gentle scooping motions to lift and peel back Descemet's membrane around the wound edge, working toward the center of the lesion.\n\tNOTE: Descemet's membrane should come up with very little resistance. If difficulty is experienced, one is likely pulling up stroma. If this happens, start again, lifting from a new point along the wound edge.\nOnce the majority of Descemet's membrane has been separated from the stroma, use Gorovoy forceps to remove the membrane and set aside.\nExamine the stripped area for any remaining pieces of membrane and remove with Gorovoy forceps.\n3. Trypan Blue staining\nNOTE: Following Descemet's stripping, stain the cornea with Trypan Blue to visualize the wound area.\nReturn the cornea on a Petri dish lid to the biosafety cabinet and rinse in 1x PBS containing 0.01% (w/v) CaCl2 and MgCl2 to remove cell debris and facilitate tight adherence of remaining CECs to the intact Descemet's membrane.\nPlace cornea in a welled dish and pipette 30 µL of Trypan Blue onto the endothelial layer for 30 s.\n\t\nUse forceps to gently rock the cornea to ensure that the entire endothelial surface is covered.\nRinse off excess Trypan Blue in 1x PBS with 0.01% (w/v) CaCl2 and MgCl2 and image the stained cornea under a dissecting microscope for the Day 0 timepoint.",
    "Be sure cornea is balanced such that light is evenly transmitted throughout and positioning is replicable across timepoints.\n\t\t​NOTE: Forceps can be used to hold cornea in place while imaging if needed.\n4. Culture period\nCulture corneas in a six-well plate containing low-serum media consisting of OptiMEM; 1x insulin, transferrin, and selenium; 1x antibiotic/antimycotic; 0.02 mg/mL CaCl2; 0.2 mg/mL ascorbic acid; and 0.8% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum. Culture the left cornea in 8 mL of low-serum media alone, and the right cornea in 8 mL of low-serum media supplemented with 100 ng/mL eFGF1 (NM141).\n\t\nIncubate at 37 °C with 6% CO2 for 14 days with daily media changes.\nRepeat the Trypan Blue staining procedure on Days 3, 6, 9, 12, and 14, and image each cornea immediately after staining. Be sure to keep camera settings consistent across all timepoints.\nOn Day 12, add 10 µM EdU to both control and eFGF1 (NM141)-supplemented media and incubate for 48 h to label proliferating cells. Renew media with EdU added again on Day 13.\nOn Day 14, 48 h after the addition of EdU, Trypan stain and image corneas as usual, except instead of 1x PBS with CaCl2 and MgCl2, use plain 1x PBS for rinses to prevent the calcium from interacting with the Alizarin Red stain.\n5. Alizarin Red staining\nOn Day 14, prepare 5% Alizarin Red in 0.9% saline solution.\n\tNOTE: Alizarin Red will not dissolve completely in saline solution. Upon combining, vortex solution and rock for at least 1 h. Vortex once more and filter before use to remove undissolved particles.\nOnce Trypan staining and imaging have been completed, transfer corneas to a welled dish and add 200 µL Alizarin Red to the endothelial surface of each cornea.",
    "Stain for 2 min, then rinse each cornea in a Petri dish of 1x PBS to remove excess Alizarin Red before placing in a six-well plate pre-filled with 8 mL of 1x PBS for two 5 min washes.\nAfter the second wash, image the stripped area of each cornea under a dissecting microscope.\n\t​NOTE: Unlike with Trypan imaging, corneas can be left in 1x PBS to image Alizarin staining to prevent them from drying out during the process.\n6. Fixation and permeabilization\nOnce Alizarin images have been captured, transfer corneas to a 12-well plate and wash in 4 mL of 1x PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-T) for 30 min to remove any particles from tissue prior to fixation.\nFix corneas in 4 mL of 4% PFA for 30 min at room temperature.\nPermeabilize cells for 5 min in 4 mL of 1x PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, then wash three times in 4 mL of plain 1x PBS for 30 min each.\n7. Immunohistochemistry\nBlock corneas for 1 h at 37°C in 4 mL of 1x PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 2% goat serum.\nIncubate in 1 mL of blocking solution containing 2.5 µg/mL primary antibody mouse anti-ZO-1 for 1 h at 37°C, then wash three times in 4 mL of 1x PBS for 30 min each.\n\tNOTE: The plate can be tilted during antibody staining to minimize the volume of reagents needed. Just ensure that the entire cornea is completely submerged in antibody solution.\nPerform the EdU Click-iT reaction using a cocktail containing 0.88 mg/mL ascorbic acid, 0.26 mg/mL CuSO4, and 2.5 µM Alexa Fluor 488 azide.\n\t\nPrepare reaction components\n\t\t\nAdd 500 µL of 1x PBS to 88 mg of ascorbic acid and vortex until dissolved.",
    "Add 840 µL of deionized water to 44 mg of CuSO4 and vortex until dissolved.\nPrepare cocktail by adding the following reagents to 6 mL of 1x PBS in this order, inverting tube to mix after each addition: 30 µL of ascorbic acid solution, 30 µL of CuSO4 solution, and then 15 µL of Alexa Fluor 488\n\t\tNOTE: Once prepared, this solution is light sensitive. For the remainder of the protocol, corneas should be protected from light whenever possible.\nAdd 1 mL of EdU reaction cocktail to each cornea and react for 1 h at room temperature.\nAdd 4 mL of 10 µg/mL Hoechst 33342 to each cornea and react for 2 min at room temperature, then wash three times in 1x PBS-T for 30 min each.\nIncubate in 1 mL of blocking solution containing 2 µg/mL Alexa Fluor 555 labeled goat anti-mouse IgG for 1 h at 37°C, then wash three times in 1x PBS-T for 30 min each.\nStore corneas at 4 °C in 4 mL of 1x PBS with 1% anti/anti, 0.1% ciprofloxacin, and 0.1% Amphotericin B to prevent microbial growth.\nWhen performing confocal imaging, mount whole corneas in 200 µL of mounting medium on glass slides with coverslip taped down to flatten.\n8. Trypan Image Analysis\nPerform all image analysis using NIH's open-source software ImageJ. Open an image using File > Open and click Image > Adjust > Color threshold.\nUse the \"Hue\" sliders to encompass only the blue range and adjust the upper \"Brightness\" slider all the way to the left to include more of the stained area.\n\tNOTE: If this action causes parts of the image that are not Trypan stained to be included, the \"Brightness\" slider can be returned to its original level.",
    "Slowly adjust the upper \"Saturation\" slider until the thresholding accurately outlines the stained area.\n\tNOTE: It is helpful to have a copy of the original image open to refer to during this process.\nClick the Select button within the color threshold menu, then use the selection brush tool to de-select areas outside of the wound that were picked up.\nClick Analyze > Measure to report the stained area in pixels.\nDe-select all using Edit > Selection > Select None and use the oval selection tool to fit the limbus as closely as possible, then click Analyze > Measure to report the area of the cornea in pixels.\n\tNOTE: Brightness can be turned up temporarily to aid in visualization of the limbus if this part of the image is too dark.\nRecord area values and divide the stained area by the area of the whole cornea, then multiply by 100 to calculate the percent stained.\nRepeat this process two more times for each image, then take the average of the three measurements.\n9. Statistical Analysis\nOnce all images have been analyzed, divide the average percent stained on Day 14 by the percent stained on Day 0 to determine the residual unhealed area. Subtract this amount from 100% to calculate the percentage of the stripped area healed over 14 days.\nUse a paired t-test to compare percent healed values between control and treatment groups."
