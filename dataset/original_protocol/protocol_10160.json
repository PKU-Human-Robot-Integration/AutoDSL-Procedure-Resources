    "The experimental protocols were approved by the University of Nevada, Reno Social, Behavioral, and Educational Institutional Review Board.\n1. Stimuli and Apparatus\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59762/59762fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Real object (displayed on the turntable) and matched 2-D image of the same item (displayed on a computer monitor). The stimuli in this experiment consisted of 60 popular snack food items. The real foods (left panel) were photographed on the turntable and their resulting 2-D images (right panel) were matched closely for the apparent size, distance, viewpoint, and background.

Ideally, make sure the foods span a wide range of caloric densities (e.g., 0.18 to 6.07)7. Open the packaging for each food and place both the package and some of the food on a plate. Use white paper plates to maximize stimulus contrast.\n2-D Photographs\nPlace a plate of food on a cell of the turntable (see Figure 2) and photograph the stimulus on the turntable so that the background of the stimulus in the 2-D image matches the real food counterpart (see Figure 1).\nPosition a camera (see Table of Materials) on a tripod in front of the turntable. Set the distance, height, and angle, of the camera to match that of the participant’s eyes when the stimulus is viewed from straight-ahead. Position the camera 50 cm (or less) from the edge of the turntable to ensure that the photos are perceived to be within the reaching distance of the participant.",
    "Set, and hold constant, the source of illumination in the testing room. Use a direct source of illumination, such as ceiling lights or a lamp, to provide direct illumination of the stimuli on the turntable. Ensure that the same lighting levels and sources are used during the presentation of the real foods during the experiment. Photograph the real foods on the turntable (using the same lighting sources) using a camera with constant F-stop and shutter speed. Match as closely as possible the overall luminance, shading patterns and specular highlights across display formats. Repeat this process for each stimulus.\nIf necessary, adjust the 2-D images for color, luminance, and visual size using image processing software (see Table of Materials). Click on the Hue/Saturation and Brightness/Contrast tabs and move the sliders until the image looks as similar as possible to its real-world counterpart when mounted on the turntable.\nFine tune the size of the object in the image by positioning the real object next to the computer monitor and increase/decrease the pixel size until the stimuli are matched exactly for size. Make sure that the image processing software page view (zoom) is set at 100% when editing.\nEnsure that the monitor used for editing the images is the same (or the same size) monitor that will be used as the participant monitor during the study. Hold the resolution, aspect ratio and pixels per inch of the images as constant. Additionally, confirm that the monitor is large enough to display the largest stimulus at its full size.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59762/59762fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2: Schematic showing turntable components and assembly. (A) Major components of the turntable device and their relative positioning. (B) Assembled turntable apparatus with 20 individual cells. A real object can be placed inside each cell. The vertical dividers prevent participants from viewing items in neighboring cells. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59762/59762fig2large.jpg]\nTurntable apparatus\nCreate a circular (wood) base for the turntable that is 2 m in diameter and a round central core (56 cm in diameter and 24 cm H) with 20 slots (1 cm W; see Figure 2). Place the core on top of a rotating cylinder, allowing for an easy rotation (see Figure 2A).\nCreate 20 dividers (H 24 cm x L 62 cm x W 0.5 cm). Slide each divider into the central core of the turntable to form 20 cells (24 cm x 62 cm x 26 cm).\nPlace the circular base on the top of a table (~72 cm H, see Figure 3A). Make sure the table is at a height that would allow a seated participant to comfortably view items on the turntable.\nCreate a vertical partition (81 cm x 127.5 cm) between the turntable and the participant (see Figure 3B). Place the partition 26 cm from the turntable allowing room for an LCD computer monitor behind the partition. Ensure that the space between the partition and the turntable does not place the stimuli out of reach of the participant.",
    "Construct an aperture in the partition. Make sure the width of the aperture is adjustable so that, in the final setup, the participant can see only one item on the turntable at a time (see Figure 3B). Importantly, ensure that the aperture is wide/high enough that it does not interfere with the participants' physical access to the stimuli on the turntable.\nCreate a sliding platform (L 18.5 cm x W 11.5 cm piece of wood with wheels attached to the underside) for the participant monitor (see Figure 3D).\n\t\t\nPlace the sliding platform and participant monitor between the turntable and the partition to allow for rapid transitions between display format conditions (see Figure 3D). Position the participant monitor within the viewing aperture during image trials; retract the monitor behind the partition on real object trials (see Figure 3).\nUse a small desk, or create a shelf, for the experimenter monitor (see Figure 3A,C). Use the experimenter monitor to present prompts as to when to set up a real item or an image, and the identity of the object, for the upcoming trial.\nAttach a keyboard tray, for the mouse, to the turntable base directly underneath the aperture in the partition (see Figure 3B). Attach a curtain (or similar occluder) between the sides of the turntable and the wall to prevent the participant from viewing the stimuli and the experimenter during the experiment.  \nPurchase (or make) computer-controlled liquid crystal occlusion glasses37 (See Figure 3B,C and Table of Materials).\nNOTE: The occlusion glasses provide millisecond control of stimulus viewing time. The glasses become opaque ('closed state') during the inter-trial interval and transparent ('open state') during stimulus presentation. Computer commands for controlling the glasses (and all other scripts and files necessary for running the protocol described here) are available at http://www.laboratorysys.com/Data/JoVE_Real%20Object_Code.zip).",
    "Test that the glasses open and close correctly (i.e., use 'GlassesTest' script, available at http://www.laboratorysys.com/Data/JoVE_Real%20Object_Code.zip) before the start of the experiment.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59762/59762fig3.jpg",
    "Figure 3: How to set-up and use the turntable apparatus for testing.  (A) Setup of the turntable apparatus ready for testing. Once the turntable has been assembled it should be placed on a table at a comfortable height for a seated participant. A vertical partition should be created and placed between the participant and the turntable. Within the partition, there should be a viewing aperture. A 'participant monitor' is used for viewing the 2-D images. The LCD monitor should be positioned behind the vertical partition and viewing aperture, and in front of the turntable. The monitor is mounted on a sliding platform that allows it to move in and out of the participant's view across trials. An 'experimenter monitor', which is placed out of view of the participant, is used to inform the experimenter of which stimulus to present on upcoming trials. (B) View of the apparatus and a real object stimulus from the participants' perspective. Only one food item should be visible to a participant at a time. A keyboard tray should be attached to the desk directly in front of where the participant is seated. Participants make responses with a computer mouse. (C) Side view showing the participant monitor mounted on the sliding platform. For image trials, the experimenter slides the participant monitor into the viewing aperture. The participant monitor is retracted behind the vertical partition on real object trials. (D) Aerial schematic showing the setup of the turntable apparatus. A single real object can be placed in each of the 20 cells of the turntable. The participant should be seated in front of the viewing aperture while wearing the computer-controlled visual occlusion glasses. The experimenter can view upcoming trials on the experimenter monitor and manually rotate the turntable, or move the participant monitor, as necessary.",

    "2. General Procedure: Randomization and Design\nCreate a script using MATLAB that will randomly interleave real and image trials. Ensure that half of the participants see a given snack food (e.g., an apple) as a real object, and the remaining participants see the item as a 2-D image. For each participant, randomize the order in which the different snack foods are presented within the experiment. Have the script list which real items to place on the turntable, and in what order, prior to the start of the experiment (see 'runStudy' script, available at http://www.laboratorysys.com/Data/JoVE_Real%20Object_Code.zip).\nPlace the items on the turntable in the correct order (see Figure 3A).  \nNOTE: Depending on the number of stimuli in the study, set up time may take up to 30 min.\nPlace the monitor in the aperture and make sure all other items and the experimenter are masked from the participant's view (see 1.2.7).\nSeat the participant approximately 50 cm from the turntable and play white noise, either via a white noise machine or via earphones, so that the participant is unable to predict (i.e., from the sound of the sliding monitor) the stimulus format on the upcoming trial.\nGive the participant the glasses to put on and make sure that the glasses are in the closed/opaque state. Explain to the participant that the glasses are currently closed but will open when they need to. \nView the experimenter monitor to see what type of condition (i.e., real or image) the upcoming trial will be (see Figure 3A).\nOn 'real object' trials, retract the participant monitor from the viewing aperture, via the sliding platform, so that the object is visible to the participant on the turntable (see Figure 1A and 3).",
    "Make a computer command (e.g., a button press) to trigger the opening and closing of the glasses allowing for the real food to be visible on the turntable for 3 s. Once the glasses close, position the participant monitor back in front of the aperture and press a key to open the glasses for the participant to make a response (e.g., a bid). Have the glasses automatically close once the participant enters his/her response (see 'runStudy' script, available at http://www.laboratorysys.com/Data/JoVE_Real%20Object_Code.zip).\nView the experimenter monitor to prepare for the next trial. Press a key to advance to the next trial.\nFor 2-D image trials, place the LCD monitor within the viewing aperture (see Figure 1B and Figure 3). Press a key to open the glasses. Leave the monitor in the viewing aperture and press a key to open the glasses for the participant to make a response. Make sure the next stimulus is ready for viewing. Press a key to advance to the next trial.\n3. Procedure for Randomization and Design\nCreate a preference- and familiarity-rating task using the food item images (not the real foods; see 'runStudy', 'LikeSurvey', and 'FamSurvey' scripts, available at http://www.laboratorysys.com/Data/JoVE_Real%20Object_Code.zip). Create two different blocks for the preference- and familiarity-rating tasks and counterbalance the order of blocks across observers (see Figure 4).\nFor each participant, randomize the order of the images presented within each block and create an analog slider for participants to perform their ratings after viewing each food image (see Figure 4, 'runStudy', 'like_slider', and 'Fam_slider' scripts, available at http://www.laboratorysys.com/Data/JoVE_Real%20Object_Code.zip).",
    "Add a bidding task to the script. Randomize as described in 2.1. Add a food auction to the script. Have the computer select randomly one of the 60 food items from the bidding task. Have the computer place a random bid of its own on the selected item from $0 - $3 in 25 cents increments (see Figure 4 and 'bidModule' script, available at http://www.laboratorysys.com/Data/JoVE_Real%20Object_Code.zip).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59762/59762fig4.jpg",
    "Figure 4: Experimental design for the current study. The experiment consisted of 4 phases: (1) food preference- and familiarity-rating task, (2) bidding task, (3) food auction, (4) in-lab waiting period. Participants first complete either a preference- or familiarity-rating task (counterbalanced across participants). In the preference task, participants viewed an image of each snack food item for 3 s and then rate how much they liked the item (using a -7 to 7 rating scale) using a sliding analog bid bar. For the familiarity rating task, participants indicated how familiar they were with the item (using a 0 to 3 rating scale). Next, participants completed a bidding task in which they rated how much they were willing to pay ($0-$3) for each snack food item. Half of the stimuli were presented as real foods and half were presented as 2-D images. Viewing time on each trial was controlled using computer-controlled visual occlusion glasses. At the start of the trial, the glasses transitioned to the 'open' (transparent) state for 3 s, before returning to the 'closed' (opaque) state for a 3 s inter-trial interval. The spectacles then opened to allow the participant to record a response. Once the bidding task had been completed, an 'auction' was conducted to determine whether a participant 'won' a food item, and at what price. The auction was followed by a mandatory 30 min waiting period in the lab. If the participant won a food item, they could consume the food during the waiting period. All participants were asked to remain in the lab for the waiting period whether or not a food item was won during the auction.

    "Recruit participants who self-report that they enjoy eating and frequently consume snack foods, and who are familiar with a wide variety of snack foods (typical to the region). Ensure that participants are not actively dieting to lose weight, have any food allergies, dietary restrictions (i.e., vegetarian, gluten-free) or food-related diseases, and are not pregnant.\nIn accordance with the BDM bidding task12,35, make sure to schedule participants in the late afternoon (e.g., between 1:00 pm and 7:00 pm), which is when snack foods are typically consumed. Remind the participant to refrain from eating for 3 h prior to the experiment12.\nNOTE: This is to ensure that the participant is hungry and will bid accurately for the foods.\n5. Questionnaire Procedure\nFor each participant, collect personal demographic information (i.e., age, sex), ask whether they have a normal or corrected-to-normal vision and record height and weight (these data are useful for calculating body mass index).\n6. Preference- and Familiarity Rating Task Procedure\nAsk participants to rate how familiar they are with each of the 60 snacks. Have the participant respond via a mouse click on an analog sliding bar (e.g., \"0\" = not very familiar; \"3\" = very familiar). Ensure responses are self-paced (see Figure 4).\nAsk participants to rate how much they like each of the 60 snacks via a mouse click on an analog sliding bar (e.g., \"-7\" = strongly dislike; \"0\" = indifference; \"7\" = strongly like). Ensure responses are self-paced.\n7. Bidding Task Procedure\nInform the participant that they will be given a $3 allowance which can be used to bid on 60 common snack food items. Relay the rules of the bidding task14,35.",
    "Emphasize that the best strategy is not to bid based on retail prices, but rather, to bid one’s true value: how much one is willing-to-pay to eat the item at the end of the experiment.       \nRemind the participant that there is a mandatory 30 min waiting period in the laboratory at the end of the study (see Figure 4). Explain to the participant that if they 'win' the bidding task they will be able to consume one food item at the end of the experiment; if they 'lose' the bid they will nevertheless be asked to remain in the lab for the duration of the waiting period, without consuming any outside food or drinks.\nSeat the participant in the testing room (see 2.4-2.5). Perform a practice auction with three items that are not part of the 60 experimental items. Place the three items in front of the participant one at a time. Ask the participant to rate how much they like the item (-7 to 7).\nPlace the items in front of the participant once again one at a time. Ask the participant to bid ($0 - $3) on each item. Ensure the participant understands the instructions -ask questions to cross-check comprehension.\nPlace $3 next to the mouse close to the participants' hand and remind him/her that the allowance is theirs to keep and that they may bid up to $3 per item.\nRefer to sections 2.6.1 - 2.7.1. for conducting the real object and images trials. Figure 4 illustrates the bidding task procedure.\n8. Food Auction/ 30 Min Waiting Period Procedure\nCheck to see whether or not the participant 'won' a snack food item and at what price (see 'runStudy' script, available at http://www.laboratorysys.com/Data/JoVE_Real%20Object_Code.zip).",
    "NOTE: The computer will make a bid consisting of a random number between $0 and $3, in 25 cents increments. If the computer's bid is less-than-or-equal-to the participant's bid, then the participant 'wins' the item for consumption. The participant pays the experimenter the price of the computer's bid from their $3 allowance. A number of previous studies have provided an in-depth consideration of the rationale for the BDM bidding task34,36,38.\n9. Calorie Estimation Procedure\nFor each food item displayed in the main experiment, present a text display (i.e., 'Snickers bar') and ask the participant to estimate (write down with a pen) how many calories they think are in the serving size.\n10. Data Analysis\nUse statistical analysis software (see Table of Materials) to perform a linear mixed effects modeling analysis. Use a linear mixed effects model to account for the nested responses within participants (i.e., the dependence of observations from the same participant). Create a dataset with the following variables: Participants, Item, Display Format, Preference, Caloric Density, Estimated Calories, and Bid. Create a model by clicking Analyze, then Mixed Models, then Linear.\nTransfer the variable Participants into the Subjects: box then press continue. Transfer Bid into the Dependent Variable: box. Next, transfer Subject and Display Format into the Factor(s): box. Then, transfer Preference into the Covariate(s): box.\nClick Fixed, then select and add all of the variables except Participants into the Model box then click Continue. Click Random, then select and add Participants into the Combinations box in order to account for variability in responses within and across observers. Click Continue.",
    "Click Statistics, then check the Descriptive statistics, Parameter estimates, and Tests for covariance parameters boxes. Click Continue. Click EM Means and then select and transfer all of the Factors and Factor Interactions into the Display Means for box. Click Continue. Lastly, press OK.\nSubscription Required.
