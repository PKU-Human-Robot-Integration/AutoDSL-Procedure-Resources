    "gRNA designFor selection of the gRNA target, we recommend CRISPR RGEN Tools (www.rgenome.net/cas-designer/[href=http://www.rgenome.net/cas-designer/]). The 21-nucleotide target sequences should target early exons (near transcriptional start site), or critical exons of gene function, preceding a 5′-NNGRRT protospacer adjacent motif (PAM for SaCas9) sequence. We recommend choosing targeting sequences with higher out-of-frame score (≥ 65 is recommended) and with less predicted mismatches (≤ 3 mismatched bases is not recommended) throughout the whole genome, to minimize the off-target effect of SaCas9. The nucleotide GC contents should be between 20% to 80%. Discard targets with more than 4 repeated thymines (TTTT) to reduce possible termination by Polymerase III. An extra “G” nucleotide should be appended to the 5′ end of the gRNA, which is required for strong expression from the U6 promoter (Table 1).Lentiviral vectors (CMV-SaCas9-P2A-mCherry-U6-gRNA) expressing SaCas9 and gRNA used in this protocol are commercially available from Vigene Biosciences.Table 1. gRNA sequences used in this protocol table:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4\n,gRNA sequence targeting cbp,PAM,Exon,Direction\ngRNA-control,GGAGACGAATAATGCGTCTCC,/,/,/\nCBP-gRNA-1,CTGGCTGCCTGTTTGGGCAGG,CTGGGT,2,-\nCBP-gRNA-2,AAATGTCAGCGACGAGAGCAA,GCGAAT,4,+\nCBP-gRNA-3,AGCAGCTGTGGAAGCAGGAGG,TGGAGT,14,-\nCBP-gRNA-4,ATTCAGTGCTTGGGAGGCAGG,GGGAGT,2,-\nCBP-gRNA-5,AGTAACTCTGGCCATAGCTTA,ATGAAT,2,+",
    "gRNA evaluation in vitro Lentivirus productionThe day before transfection, seed approximately 500k 293T cells into a 60-mm dish with 4 ml of complete growth medium. Distribute 293T cells evenly across the dish by shifting the dish side-to-side and forward-backward.Note: The health of 293T cells is essential for virus packaging. Never use cells that are above 25 passages, growing unevenly, or looking morphologically abnormal. Carefully check the growth rate of 293T cells; we recommend a 40-60% confluence before lentivirus packaging. Replace the cell culture medium with fresh one (2 ml) 1 h before transfection, then incubate in CO2 incubator at 37°C.Aseptically transfer 200 μl of Opti-MEM to a 1.5 ml tube for each dish to be transfected. Add 400 ng CMV-SaCas9-P2A-mCherry-U6-gRNA, 200 ng pMD2.G, and 300 ng psPAX2 to the medium and slowly pipet to mix.Aseptically transfer another 200 μl of Opti-MEM to a 1.5 ml tube for each dish to be transfected. Add 4 μl of VigoFect to the 200 μl of Opti-MEM, slowly pipet to mix, and equilibrate to room temperature for 5 min.Add VigoFect solution into the plasmid solution drop by drop. Pipet the transfection solution gently and avoid making bubbles, then equilibrate to room temperature for 15 min.Add the transfection solution to 293T cells drop by drop, and gently mix by shifting the dish.Replace the culture medium with fresh one (4 ml) 6 h after transfection.Validate mCherry expression in 293T cells with a fluorescent microscope 24 h after transfection—the transfection efficiency should be above 80%.Harvest the lentivirus supernatant in a 15 ml centrifuge tube, 36 and 60 h after transfection.Centrifuge the lentivirus supernatant at 3,000 rpm for 5 min to pellet debris, and collect the supernatant in a new tube.Filter the lentivirus supernatant with a 0.",
    "45-μm PVDF filter, aliquot the lentivirus solution into single use vials, then store at -80°C.Notes:  Comply with the guidelines of BSL-2, disinfect all materials that enter in contact with the lentivirus by soaking in 10% chlorine bleach for 30 min before disposing. For lentivirus production of another gRNA (gRNA1-gRNA5), repeat steps B1c-B1k. Transduction of F98 cells in vitro The day before transfection, seed approximately 100k F98 cells into a well of 6-well plate with 2 ml complete growth medium, and distribute the cells evenly across the well.Thaw the lentivirus solution, add the appropriate volume of polybrene (1:1,000 ratio) and slowly pipet to mix.Replace the culture medium with 1 ml of lentivirus solution, then place back in the incubator.Replace the culture medium with fresh one (2 ml), 12 h after transfection.Note: To achieve higher transcription of Cas9 and gRNA, it is optional to repeat the steps B2b-B2d (repeat the addition of lentivirus solution to the same cells). Validate mCherry expression in F98 cells with a fluorescent microscope 72 h after the transfection.Extract the genomic DNA 72 h after lentivirus transfection with the Universal Genomic DNA Kit, according to the manufacturer’s protocols.gRNA evaluation via T7 endonuclease assayAmplify by PCR 600 to 1,000 bp fragments flanking the cutting site by SaCas9. Briefly spin and mix each component well before use.

    "Briefly spin to collect all liquid to the bottom of tube, then begin PCR with the following program:Initial Denaturation 98°C 30 sDenaturation            98°C 5 s (35 cycles)Annealing                  62°C 10 s (35 cycles)Extension                 72°C 20 s (35 cycles)Final Extension        72°C 2 minOptional: run a portion of the PCR product on agarose gel to confirm correct amplification. To generate heteroduplex between PCR products, set up a reaction as follows:PCR Reaction            5 μl (<250 ng)10× NEBuffer 2        2 μlNuclease-free H2O 12 μlNote: Cleavage may be incomplete if too much PCR product is added to the heteroduplex digestion reaction. To denature and anneal the products, set up a program as follows:Denaturation 95°C      5 minAnnealing 1   95-85°C -2°C/sAnnealing 2   85-25°C -0.1°C/sHold               4°C Note: Alternatively, the sample can be heated to 95°C for 10 min and cooled down to room temperature slowly. To digest heteroduplexes, set up a reaction as follows:Annealed PCR Product      19 μlEnGen T7 Endonuclease I 1 μlMix well and briefly spin, incubate the reaction at 37°C for 15 min.Add 1 µl of Proteinase K, and incubate at 37°C for 5 min to stop heteroduplex digestion.Run the products on a 2% agarose gel to analyze DNA fragments, and choose the gRNA with the highest efficiency for gene editing on target locus (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4246/bioprotoc-11-23-4246-g002.jpgFigure 2.

Use following formula to calculate the estimated % modification: % modification = 100 × [1-(1-fraction cleaved)1/2].Stereotaxic AAV injectionAnesthetize the rat (230 to 250 g) with 1% pentobarbital sodium (intraperitoneally, 0.1 g/kg).Note: Anesthesia is confirmed by absence of response to a tail pinch. Shave the scalp from eyes to ears, then position the rat in a stereotaxic instrument.",
    "Note: It is vital to align the skull along the anteroposterior and mediolateral axis via zygomatic ear bars. Sterilize the surgical field sequentially with cotton swabs dipped in iodine and alcohol.Make an incision along the midline with a scalpel, and scrape away tissues and blood below the incision with a cotton swab.Use a microsyringe fixed on the right arm of the stereotaxic instrument to mark the location of the bregma and requisite injection site: IL [anteroposterior (AP): 2.8 mm; mediolateral (ML): ±0.5 mm; dorsoventral (DV): −4.5 mm], amygdala (AP: −2.8 mm; ML: ±4.8 mm; DV: −8.4 mm).Drill small holes above the requisite coordinates, press the hole with cotton swab to stop potential bleeding.Inject 1 μl of rAAV2-retro-hSyn-Cre-P2A-GFP to the amygdala, and 1 μl of the mixture of AAV9-TRE3G-DIO-SaCas9-3×flag and AAV9-c-fos-rtTA-U6-gRNA (1:1 ratio) to the IL, at a flow rate of 0.1 μl/min with a microinjection pump.To enable virus diffusion and prevent potential leakage from the needle track, leave the needle tip in place for 5 min and gradually withdraw after each injection.Note: The needle tip can easily become blocked by blood after injection, so it is recommended to clean it with alcohol and saline each time after use. Suture the incision, then scatter wound powder above the suture.Transfer the rats to their home cages and let them recover for one week.Contextual fear conditioningThree weeks after AAV injection, handle the rats for 30 min for three consecutive days.Place the rat in the conditioning chamber (25 × 25 × 25 cm) for 300 s, deliver shocks to the feet (0.50 mA, 2 s) at 120 s, 180 s, and 240 s, then transfer the rat to its home cage.Two weeks later, feed the rat with doxycycline diet (100 mg/kg) for one day to allow a time window for activity-dependent cell labeling.",
    "One day later, place the rat in the conditioning chamber for 300 s to label IL extinction-ensemble cells with SaCas9. Transfer the rat to its home cage, and withdraw the doxycycline diet immediately.One week later, place the rat in the conditioning chamber for 300 s to monitor its fear extinction for three consecutive days.Note: Clean the chamber with ethanol prior to introducing the next rat. Freezing is defined as being motionless and indicated as the percentage of total session time. Perform standard histological immunofluorescence (Koffman and Du, 2020) on the brain tissue to verify the expression of SaCas9 after contextual fear conditioning (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4246/bioprotoc-11-23-4246-g003.jpgFigure 3.
