    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSL collection and extraction\nTiming: ∼10 h\nUnder phosphate starvation, roots of hydroponically grown plants continuously release SLs into the medium. Therefore, we recommend to let SLs accumulate in the medium for 6 h and then collect it (Wang et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]): we usually refresh the solution in the early morning and collect the medium for SL extraction 6 h later.\nOptional: For plants grown in the sand system, we recommend to collect the exudate 24 h after pre-washing the pots with 1 L –Pi half-strength modified Hoagland solution (Jamil et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nRoot exudates collection.\nIn the early morning, prepare fresh –Pi/Low Pi half-strength modified Hoagland solution with pH adjusted to ∼5.8.\nRefresh the medium (50 mL) of each tube containing rice seedlings and wait for 6 h.\nAfter 6 h, remove the plants from the tubes and store the collected medium with 50 mL tubes on ice.\nAlternatives: When using the sand system, we recommend to collect 500 –1,000 mL root exudates by adding –Pi/Low Pi half-strength modified Hoagland solution on the top of each pot and collect the flow-through, from the bottom of the pot, in 1 L plastic bottle.\nNote: During the collection, protect the collected root exudates from light to avoid SL degradation. We also recommend to extract the collected samples as soon as possible without any delay, as SLs degrade quickly in the water when exposed to light and high temperature.\nOptional: Transfer the seedlings to a new 50 mL tubes containing fresh half-strength modified Hoagland solutions for a second collection in case something goes wrong during the extraction.\nOptional: At this stage, plant tissues can be also collected for SL or transcript analysis. They should be immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.",
    "SL extraction from root exudates.\nKeep the collected root exudates on ice. In the lab, spike each sample, collected both from hydroponic and sand, with 0.672 ng of D6-5-deoxystrigol - used as internal standard (IS).\nAlternatives: The internal standard can be replaced by using the SL analog GR24 (1 ng).\nNote: If the collected exudate is to be applied to parasitic seeds, do not add internal standard. The latter will trigger high germination!\nPre-condition Fast SPE C18 column (500 mg/3 mL; GracePure), connected with SPE Vacuum Manifold with 3 mL of methanol, followed by 3 mL of Milli-Q water.\nNote: After conditioning, keep the columns wet with water and do not let them dry before sample loading! The pre-conditioning step enables a condition to enable the analyte adsorption. Wetting the adsorbent with a suitable solvent ensures reproducibility.\nAttach a 50 mL syringe to the pre-conditioned C18 column and load the collected root exudate samples (before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] step 9) onto them. After enrichment, wash the C18 column with 3 mL Milli-Q water to remove impurities.\nOptional: To get better MS resolution and sensitivity for SL identification, we suggest to pool at least 500 mL–1,000 mL root exudate.\nNote: If the volume of root exudate exceeds 200 mL, we strongly advice to add a pre-step, using glass fiber filter paper through a vacuum assembly, to remove impurities and plant debris.\nElute SLs twice, into two separate 8 mL brown glass vials: use 2 mL acetone to collect the first fraction A, followed by 3 mL acetone for the fraction B.\nNote: For the parasitic seeds bioassay, elute the collected exudate with 3 mL acetone only, as the parasitic weeds are much more sensitive than LC-MS.",
    "Pause point: Seal the collected samples with caps in the brown glass vials and keep the acetone extracted samples in −20°C refrigerator for 2-week storage or at −80°C for long-term storage.\nCritical: Try to avoid direct light exposure during the extraction process.\nSL re-extraction for LC-MS.\nFully dry the fraction B (from SL collection and extraction[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.1] step 2d; containing mostly acetone) under vacuum.\nAdd 1 mL ethyl acetate into each vial containing the dried fraction B, and gently vortex for 5 s.\nDry the fraction A (from SL collection and extraction[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.1] step 2d; containing a mix of acetone and water) under vacuum, which results in ∼300 μL partially dry (acetone-water).\nOptional: If space allows it, please vacuum-dry Fraction A and B together.\nTransfer 1 mL of re-suspended fraction B in ethyl acetate to fraction A, and gently vortex for 5 s. Two layers with ethyl acetate (up) and water (down) will appear.\nCentrifuge the samples at 1,356 × g for 2 min at room temperature.\nCarefully transfer 750 μL from the upper-layer (SLs enriched organic phase) to a new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nCritical: Do not touch the lower layer to avoid water contamination.\nFully dry the samples using a speed vacuum at room temperature.\nPause point: Keep the extracts in −20°C refrigerator if you do not want to process them immediately.\nDissolve the dried samples in 100 μL of acetonitrile:water (25:75, v:v) and filter them gently through a 0.22 μm filter into a glass autosampler vial.\nClose the vial with the cap before LC-MS/MS analysis.\nFor better detection, gently tap the bottom of the vial to remove the gases in the samples.\nPause point: Keep the filtered samples in −20°C refrigerator for storage.\nSL identification by LC-MS/MS\nTiming: 23 min per sample",
    "Although SLs are divided into canonical and non-canonical SLs (Wang et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]), they are generally traced and identified using the same methods. In our case, we use the IDX-Qrbitrap high-resolution Mass Spectrometry instrument, including the MS and MS/MS scans. The full scan MS analysis revealed the presence of the SL (4-deoxyorobanchol) at m/z 331.15402 (RT: 14.95 min). The MS/MS scan confirmed the presence of the common D-ring moiety fragment ion at m/z 97.02823, which corresponds to the conserved diagnostic product ion of SLs (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1664-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "Note: The IDX Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer is an analytical technique that contains three mass analyzers used for determining the m/z of small and big molecules. The Orbitrap IDX spectrometer could reach a high resolution (> 120,000) and reliable mass accuracy (<3 ppm mass error). The Mass spectrometer was calibrated using a purchasable “Calibration Mix ESI (Thermo Scientific)” and by following the manufacturer’s guidelines. Electrospray ionization in positive mode (ESI+) was applied for the studied compounds, using the following parameters: vaporized temperature = 100°C, voltage = 3,500 V, sheath gas = 30, auxiliary gas: 15, ion source fragmentation = 35 V, capillary temperature = 300°C. 10 μl of each sample were injected through a loop injection to a C18 column using an independent UPLC pump.\nNote: The separation of the studied metabolites was performed on a Hypersil GOLD™ C18 Selectivity HPLC Columns (150 × 4.6 mm; 3 μm) maintained at 35°C.\nNote: The mobile phases consisted of (A) 100% LC-MS grade water + 0.1% formic acid and (B) 100% Acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]).

    "Note: The TSQ Altis is a triple stage quadrupole Mass Spectrometer that determines the m/z of small molecules and which provides the best transmission and peak shape. This instrument has an electrospray ionization source and is capable of scan functions, such as Selective Ion Monitoring (SIM), Selective/Multiple Reaction Monitoring (S/MRM), and precursor ion scanning.
