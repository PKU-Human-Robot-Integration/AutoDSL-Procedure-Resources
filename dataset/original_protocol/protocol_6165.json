    "Note: To measure oxygen consumption, we adapted a published protocol (Dancy et al., 2016).Grow worms at 20 °C on NGM plates spotted with OP50. Pick 300 L4-staged worms per condition to synchronize the experimental animals and age them as desired. The experimental animals should be at least in their second generation of being grown in an uncrowded, unstarved and uncontaminated environment.Prior to the day of the experimentCalibrate the sensor cartridgesThe sensor cartridge has three parts: the lid, the cartridge itself containing probes on the bottom and ports for adding drugs on top, and the 24-well plate where the cartridge is placed in. Add 1 ml of calibrant solution into each well of the 24-well plate and incubate the plate at 37 °C overnight. Make sure the heater on the Seahorse XF24 is turned off. Ideally, the temperature of the room where the experiment will be performed in should ideally not exceed 20 °C, and certainly not higher than 23 °C, to prevent the worms from receiving a heat-shock.On the day of the experimentIf assessing basal respiration only, start with Step B2. To assess maximal respiration, use the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation uncoupler FCCP, no other drugs are necessary. Pipet 75 μl of 192 μM FCCP into one of the 4 ports available for each well (Figure 2). For simultaneous release of FCCP into each well, distribute FCCP into the same port for each well (Figure 2). While wild-type worms will respond to this dose of FCCP, some optimization may be required for mutant strains. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190702/20190702080847_9613.jpgFigure 2.

The (A) side-view and (B) top-view of the 24-well sensor cartridge, where the sensor is in the center and the injection ports for compounds are in the periphery of each well.",
    "Pick the same injection port, which would be the ports of the same color, for each well when adding a compound. Make sure the equipment is at room temperature and the heater is turned off (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190702/20190702080928_0019.jpgFigure 3. Instructions to turn off the heater in the Seahorse X24. A. This screen appears once the program opens. Select the “Standard” mode (red circle), which opens the screen in (B). B. Select “Instrument” (red circle), which opens the screen in (C). C. Select “Administration” (red circle), which opens the screen in (D). D. Select “Temp. Control” (red circle), which opens the screen in (E). In this final screen, the circle next to “ON” should be clicked until it appears dim, similar to the figure, and then select “ok” on that screen.Run the calibration program with the cartridge.Prepare the XF24 cell culture microplates by adding 450 μl of M9 into each well. Prepare worms:Worms tend to stick to plastics, so it is always necessary to wash the plastic pipet tips and centrifuge tubes with 0.1% Triton X-100 in M9 prior to aspirating and ejecting worms. Pre-wash centrifuge tube by adding 1 ml 0.1% Triton X-100 in M9. Remove the solution and replace it with 1 ml M9 using 1000 μl plastic pipette tips. Pick 300 worms into a microcentrifuge tube.Gently pipet the worms to dissolve bacterial clumps that were transferred with the worms.Let the worms settle by gravity to the bottom of the 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and remove as much of the M9 buffer and bacteria as possible. Add 1 ml M9 buffer and repeat Steps B5c and B5d twice. Keep the supernatant of the last wash which will be used as control for Step B5i. Add 600 μl of M9 buffer to the worms.",
    "Cut off the end of a 200 μl tip to create a wide bore tip. Rinse it in 0.1% Triton M9 buffer by pipetting up and down in the solution. Flick the tube gently to mix worms. Pipet 50 μl into a well of the XF24 cell culture microplates. Remember to flick the worms every time prior to pipetting them into the well. Each sample should be divided into 5 wells containing approximately 50 worms each.Arranging the samples in the XF24-well plate.Leave the four wells, A1, B4, C3, and D6, empty to be used as controls (Figure 4).Distribute each sample in random parts of the plate (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190702/20190702081032_9816.jpgFigure 4. A sample XF24 well plate with empty control wells A1, B4, C3 and D6. This mock plate contains 4 different conditions [C1 (orange), C2 (green), C3 (yellow), and C4 (orange)] with 5 replicates each (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5).Take an image of each well with worms to register the exact number of worms in each well at 20x magnification. Ideally, there should be between 50 and 70 worms. Less than 50 worms may result in greater variability and more than 70 worms in a well may result in an inaccurate assessment of the number of worms per well. Leave the worms at 20 °C for one hour.Set up the program on the XF24 Analyzer as follows (Figure 5):Ten cycles of 2 min mixing, 2 min resting, 2 min reading. When assessing maximal capacity, add a step to inject the ports and add 10 cycles of 2 min mixing, 2 min resting, 2 min reading.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190702/20190702081111_9722.jpgFigure 5. Seahorse XF24 protocol for acquiring maximal respiratory capacity. Note that when assessing basal respiration only, steps 8-13 should be removed."
