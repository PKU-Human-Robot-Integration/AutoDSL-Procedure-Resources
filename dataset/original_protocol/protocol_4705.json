    "Cell IsolationNote:The AutoMacs® automatic cell sorting is the preferred method for isolating naEFCs however a manual method using the MS columns has also been included if an AutoMacs® is not accessible.AutoMacs® automatic cell sortingCollect 40-250 ml of human cord blood from the umbilical vein of placentas from healthy pregnant women, preferably from caesarean section, into cord blood collection bags.Transfer cord blood into 50 ml tubes by cutting the tube of the collection bag and draining 25 ml of blood directly into each tube (note 20 ml of this volume is due to the anticoagulant in the collection bags).Dilute blood 1:1 with sterile DPBS and mix by inverting the tubes 3-4 times.In fresh 50 ml tubes add 15 ml of lymphoprepTM (use 15 ml of lymphoprepTM regardless of blood volume in tube).Carefully layer 35 ml of the diluted blood onto the lymphoprepTM using a 25 ml pipette with the pipette gun set to slow. Do this very slowly so the layer of blood and the layer of lymphoprepTM do not mix (see Figure 3). Repeat until all the diluted blood is layered onto lymphoprepTM in tubes. Minimise the time the blood remains on the lymphoprepTM. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160328/20160328054920_6625.jpgFigure 3. Before and after density centrifugation to separate mononuclear cells. As seen in (A) blood is layered on top of the lymphoprepTM carefully to avoid mixing. Red blood cells can be seen starting to settle down. (B) shows the expected layers following density centrifugation. The buffy layer containing the mononuclear cells is then taken for cell sorting. It is not unusual for cord blood samples to have red blood cells contamination in the buffy layer, have a chunky appearance to the buffy layer or for the plasma layer to appear red from lysed red blood cells, this is all normal.",
    "Immediately centrifuge at 700 x g for 20 min at room temperature with both the brake and acceleration turned to zero to allow the mononuclear cells (MNCs) to separate.After centrifugation, the MNCs should be visible as a buffy coat at the interphase between the lymphoprep and the plasma/DPBS layer (see Figure 3).Carefully collect the MNCs using a soft sterile bulb transfer pipette by slowly sucking up the buffy layer of cells and transferring the cells to a clean 50 ml tube (this may require multiple tubes it there is a large sample of blood with multiple lymphoprepTM tubes).Repeat transfer until no buffy coat remains in each lymphoprepTM tube.Dilute transferred buffy coat cells 1:1 with HUVE media in 50 ml tube/s.Centrifuge at 450 x g for 5 min at room temperature.Aspirate the supernatant, resuspend cells in 10 ml of HUVE media.Combine cells into one 50 ml tube, if required. Take a sample for cell counting to determine total cell number. Counting a range of 50-250 cells to calculate cell number should give an accurate enough result for this stage of the protocol, an appropriate volume and dilution to achieve this range may need to be worked out.Dilute cells 1:1 (as a minimum dilution) with the white blood cell counting fluid. Leave mix for 2 min so red blood cells can lyse for a more accurate cell count. All nucleated cells will appear blue for counting on a haemocytometer or equivalent. Count cells and determine total cell number. Wash cells twice more by resuspending in 25 ml HUVE media followed by centrifugation at 450 x g for 5 min at room temperature. When aspirating supernatant do not remove all media from the pellet before resuspension to improve cell yield.",
    "Aspirate supernatant and resuspend ≤ 1 x 108 cells in 500 μl of HUVE media by pipetting up and down slowly and transfer to a 10 ml tube (if there is more than 1 x 108 cells add 1 ml of HUVE media and split into 2 tubes and continue for each tube).Add 100 μl of human FcR blocking reagent followed by 100 μl of resuspended CD133 microbeads and mix well. Incubate for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. Centrifuge tubes at 4 °C at 450 x g for 5 min (for manual cell sorting proceed to protocol below).Meanwhile turn on AutoMACS® Pro and attach running buffer and perform rinse cycle as per manufacturer’s instructions.Aspirate supernatant carefully and resuspend cells in 3 ml sterile MACS buffer by gently pipetting up and down.On the AutoMACS® Pro select “possel-s” (positive selection-sensitive) and set the desired number of samples as per manufacturer’s instructions.Use chilled AutoMACS® Chill 15 rack and insert sample tube with cells into position 1 and empty 10 ml tubes into position 2 (CD133 negative) and 3 (CD133 positive). Run program.Combine all CD133 positively sorted cells and perform a cell count with the white blood cell counting fluid as per step 15 to determine media volume for seeding.Centrifuge at 450 x g for 5 min at room temperature.For manual cell sortingAttach miniMACSTM magnetic separator to the MultiStand and insert an MS column (1 per sample) into the separator and place a collection tube under the column (this can be seen in the manufacturer's product information sheet).To prepare column, add 500 μl MACS buffer to the top of the column and allow to flow through the column (it will not run dry). Discard flow through from collection tube.",
    "Aspirate supernatant (from step A19) carefully and resuspend cells in 1 ml sterile MACS buffer by gently pipetting up and down.Add the cell suspension to the top of the column 500 μl at a time. Unlabelled cells will flow through into the collection tube.Wash the column by adding 500 μl of MACS buffer to the column. Repeat 3 times. Remove the MS column from the separator and place on a new collection tube.Add 1 ml of MACS buffer to the column and using the plunger supplied with the column, immediately flush out positively labelled cells by firmly pushing the plunger down the column.Proceed to step A24.Initial cell seedingCoat a 24 well plate with 300 µl of fibronectin for each well (about 1-6 wells will be required depending on sample size) and leave well plate for at least 30 min in a 5% CO2 incubator set to 37 °C.Make up required amount of EGM-2 media with growth factors.Resuspend CD133+ cells at a density of 1 x 106 cells/ml in EGM-2 with growth factors.Aspirate the fibronectin from the wells, no additional washing is required.Add cells to the well/s (1-2 ml per well).Place well plate into a 5% CO2 incubator set to 37 °C this is considered as day 0.Cell culture (separating non-adherent and adherent cells)After 48 h (day 2) from initial seeding, cells need to be transferred to a new fibronectin coated well to separate the desired non-adherent cells from the small number of adherent cells.Coat new a 24 well plate with 300 µl of fibronectin for each well leave well plate for at least 30 min in a 5% CO2 incubator set to 37 °C. Separate non-adherent cells by collecting all non-adherent cells from all wells into a 10 ml tube.",
    "Wash all wells with 1 ml per well of DPBS by pipetting gently up and down in each well and add to the tube of non-adherent cells.Centrifuge at 450 x g for 5 min at room temperature.Aspirate supernatant carefully to avoid sucking up any of the cell pellet and resuspend cells in fresh EGM-2 with growth factors at a density of 1 x 106 cells/ml.Aspirate the fibronectin from the wells (no additional washing is required) and add cells (1-2 ml per well) to the newly fibronectin coated well/s.Place well plate into a 5% CO2 incubator set to 37 °C until day 4-5 when a homogeneous population of cells is formed (see Figure 2 for examples of the cell population at this stage)."
