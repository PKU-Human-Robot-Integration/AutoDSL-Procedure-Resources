    "The study was evaluated by the Regional Ethical Committee of the Capital Region of Denmark (file no. H-21054272), who determined that this was a quality study. In accordance with Danish legislation, the study was thus approved locally by the internal Research and Quality Improvement Board at the Department of Clinical Physiology and Nuclear Medicine, Rigshospitalet (file no. KF-509-22). The study was performed according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects provided oral and written informed consent prior to enrolment. Men and women, ≥18 years, were included in the study. Individuals with peripheral arterial disease, heart failure, neurological and musculoskeletal disease hindering KEE effort, and symptoms of disease within 2 weeks prior to the study, were excluded.\n1. Setup of the participant\nPlace the participant in the single-leg knee-extensor chair with the back of the participant resting against the chair (Supplementary Figure 1). Dress the participant in underwear that makes it possible to access the inguinal region with an ultrasound probe.\nPlace three ECG electrodes (see Table of Materials) on the participant. Place the electrodes on the right side of the chest wall in the third intercostal space, on the left side in the third intercostal space, and on the left side in the eleventh intercostal space so that the electrodes are equidistant from the heart.\nPlace the participant at a >90-degree angle between the abdomen and thigh.\nAdjust the arm connecting the single-knee extensor chair to the flywheel to enable the participant to extend the knee fully.\nTie the leg of the participant tightly to the pedal of the chair to avoid the usage of muscles in the lower part of the limb.\nPlace a chair or a bench to stabilize the inactive leg.",
    "NOTE: The angle of >90 degrees is considered a minimum. Increasing the angle will open the inguinal area allowing better access to the femoral artery with the ultrasound probe. This approach is often used when subjects have abdominal adiposity that can interfere with scanning.\n\tAdding resistance to the single-leg knee-extensor chair is done differently depending on the type and model and is thus not described in detail. Both absolute and relative intensity can be reported. In order to report relative intensity, perform a test to exhaustion on a preceding day.\n2. Setup of the ultrasound apparatus\nPress the Turn on button.\nPress Patient to create a file where the examination will be saved. Move the cursor to \"new patient\" and press enter. Fill out the \"patient ID\" move the cursor to \"Create\" and press Enter (Supplementary Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 3).\nPress Probe, choose the linear probe (9 MHz), and apply ultrasound gel (see Table of Materials) to the probe.\n\t​NOTE: It is not possible to save the data from the participant without assigning a \"Patient ID\". Assigning more data to this sheet is possible but not necessary for the examination to be performed.\n3. Doppler ultrasound scan\nOperate the linear probe with the hand closest to the participant and place it in the inguinal region. Find the best arterial section for obtaining LBF measurements carefully. This is below the inguinal ligament and 3-4 cm above the bifurcation of the common femoral artery on a straight segment of the artery.\nHold the probe perpendicular to the vessel. Press the 2D button and make a cross-sectional image of the common femoral artery (CFA).",
    "Optimize gain and depth, which are to be maintained throughout the experiment, to ensure that the artery is in the middle of the screen and that the blood is black. Turn the Gain button clockwise to increase gain and counterclockwise to decrease gain. Turn the Depth clockwise to increase the depth and counterclockwise to decrease it.\n\tNOTE: Please see Supplementary Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 3 for the localization of the buttons and Supplementary Figure 4 for an ultrasound image optimized with gain and depth.\nWhile in 2D mode, press Freeze once and scroll using the trackball to find an end-systolic image. Perform this under ECG-guidance by stopping the image at the end of the T-wave.\nPress Measure once and move the cursor to the superficial intimal layer of the artery, and press Enter. Move the cursor to the deep intimal layer of the artery and then press Enter to obtain the diameter at end-systole. The diameter will be shown in the top left corner.\nPress Freeze and turn the probe 90 degrees clockwise while keeping the artery in the middle of the screen and holding it parallel to the artery to create a longitudinal view. Press the pulse wave button PW and then press Measure. This will create a drop-down menu on the right side of the screen. Move the cursor to CFA and press enter.\nMove the cursor to \"Auto\" and press Enter. Move the cursor to \"Flow volume\" and press Enter. Move the cursor to \"Live,\" and press Enter to obtain the trace and finish by pressing Measure once.",
    "Obtain the velocity at the lowest possible insonation angle and always below 60 degree. Turn the Steer Angle button clockwise to decrease it and counterclockwise to increase it. Turn the Angle correction button to ensure the trace is obtained with the cursor being horizontal to the artery, as shown in Supplementary Figure 4.\nPress Sample vol. to adjust according to the width of the artery and keep clear of the walls of the artery. To decrease the sample size, press the left arrow. To increase the sample size, press the right arrow.\nObtain the blood flow velocity trace with simultaneous 2D visualization of the artery and audio-visual blood velocity feedback. Ensure that the sound is on by turning the Sound button clockwise.\nObtain the first trace during seated rest for a minimum of 30 s and press Image Store twice to save the trace. Then instruct the participant to keep a pace of 60 rounds per minute (RPM) during the test and to only use the quadriceps muscle to perform the leg extensions and keep the hamstring muscle relaxed. Keep the probe fixed during the entire experiment.\nInstruct the participant to keep a pace of 60 rounds per minute (RPM) at 0 W and only to use the quadriceps muscle to perform the leg extensions and keep the hamstring muscle relaxed. Keep the probe fixed during the entire experiment and press Image Store twice to save the trace.\nAdd resistance and have the participant complete at least 150 s of exercise before obtaining the 30 s of trace and then press Image Store twice to save the trace.\n4. Quantitation of blood flow\nOnce all the images are obtained, press Review.\nPress Track Ball and move the cursor to the image of desire, and double-click on Enter.",
    "Once the desired trace appears, press Measure and move the cursor to \"Flow volume\" in the drop-down menu on the right side of the screen and press Enter.\nMove the cursor to the 2D ultrasound image, press Enter, then drag the cursor until it reaches the diameter measured during rest and press Enter again.\nTurn the Cursor Select button clockwise twice and choose the 30 s of trace that will be shown between two vertical lines by scrolling the trackball and pressing Enter.\nCalculate the LBF as the product of mean blood velocity (cm/s) and cross-sectional area of the femoral artery (cm2), which will be shown in the top left corner.\n\tNOTE: Perform quality control prior to data analysis by visual inspection of the trace and exclude pulse waves affected by motion artifacts as well as irregular heartbeats. It is possible to adjust angle correction after completing the examination by turning the Angle Corr. button clockwise to decrease it and counterclockwise to increase it to ensure the cursor is horizontal to the artery.\nSubscription Required.
