  "procedures": [
    "Human skin was obtained from Caucasian men and women aged 26 to 61 years (sun-protected skin; abdominal corrections, breast reductions). Written informed patient consent was obtained before tissue collection in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and with approval from the Vienna Medical University Institutional Review Board.\nNOTE: We provide a protocol for the isolation of functionally distinct fibroblast subpopulations either from full thickness dermis (please refer to section 1) or after sectioning human skin dermis into its different layers (skip section 1 and directly refer to section 2).\n1. Preparation of Full Thickness Dermis\nPlace a 10 cm x 10 cm human skin piece (e.g., from abdominal corrections or breast reductions) with the epidermis facing downwards on thick filter paper.\nHold the epidermis tightly on its edges with forceps and scrape off the subcutaneous fat layer with a scalpel. Then slice the tissue into 5 mm wide strips before putting them into a Petri dish.\nNOTE: This facilitates penetration of Dispase II (referred to as dissociating enzyme henceforth, see section 3) and is used if the epidermis needs to be separated from the entire dermis. For this skip section 2 and directly refer to section 3. To avoid contamination, keep the tissue sterile after surgical removal or clean it thoroughly with ethanol or iodine solution. If at all, ethanol treatment of the skin surface causes only minor cell death. Work under sterile conditions in a tissue culture flow hood.\n2. Sectioning of Human Skin Dermis into Papillary and Reticular Layers with a Dermatome\nPlace a 10 cm x 10 cm skin piece (e.g., from abdominal corrections or breast reductions) on thick filter paper, with the epidermis facing upwards. Hold the skin tightly on its edges with forceps.",
    "Slice the skin with an electric dermatome, adjusted to a cutting thickness/depth of 300 µm, by sliding the head of the dermatome away from oneself, with the blade being at a 90° angle in relation to the surface of the skin.\nTake the first layer consisting of epidermis and papillary dermis (300 µm thick, “Dermal layer 1”, Figure 1 and Figure 2) and put it in a Petri dish. Proceed immediately to section 3 or add 1x PBS to keep the tissue from drying out.\nNOTE: To avoid contamination, keep tissue sterile after surgical removal or clean it thoroughly with ethanol or iodine solution. Work under sterile conditions in a tissue culture flow hood.\nCAUTION: Handle dermatome carefully since the blades are very sharp.\nRepeat step 2.2 adjusting the dermatome to a cutting thickness of 700 µm and slice the remaining dermis. Place the upper slice which is defined as the upper reticular dermis (“Dermal layer 2”, Figure 2) into a separate Petri dish. Proceed immediately to section 4 or add 1x PBS to keep the tissue from drying out.\nScrape away the subcutaneous fat layer with a scalpel from the residual lower reticular dermal layer (>1,000 µm) and discard it. Collect the lower reticular dermis (“Dermal layer 3”, Figure 2) in another Petri dish. Proceed immediately to section 4 or add 1x PBS to keep the tissue from drying out.\nNOTE: Alternatively, instead of scraping the fat off with a scalpel, remove the fat layer with scissors. It may help to put the reticular dermis on ice prior to scraping the fat away.\n3. Separation of Epidermis and Dermis",
    "Prepare a 3 U/mL dissociating enzyme (i.e., Dispase II) solution in sterile 1x PBS. Place the 5 mm skin stripes (from section 1), or the epidermis/papillary dermis (from step 2.2), with the epidermis facing upward in a 10 cm Petri dish with 10 mL of 3 U/mL dissociating enzyme solution. Incubate the Petri dish at 37 °C for 1 h.\nThe protocol may be paused here. Incubate epidermis/papillary dermis in protease in the refrigerator at 4 °C overnight instead. As needed store the other layers (Dermal layer 1, 2 and 3) overnight immersed in 1x PBS in 50 mL tubes at 4 °C.\nCAUTION: Work carefully with protease, it may irritate skin and eyes upon contact.\nAfter incubation, transfer the epidermis/papillary dermis to the dry lid of the Petri dish and separate the epidermis from the upper dermis (Dermal layer 1) with two forceps each holding the edge of either the epidermis or dermis.\n4. Enzymatic Digestion of Dermal Tissue\nMince each dermal layer (Dermal layer 1, 2 and 3) separately with scissors/scalpel as thoroughly as possible; the smaller the pieces, the better the tissue digestion.\nNOTE: The toughness of the dermis can vary depending on the body part it originates from (e.g., abdominal or upper arm skin).\nPrepare the digestion mix by combining 1.25 mg/mL collagenase I, 0.5 mg/mL collagenase II, 0.5 mg/mL collagenase IV and 0.1 mg/mL hyaluronidase in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with L-glutamine (see Table of Materials), 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S).\nCAUTION: Work carefully with collagenases as these may irritate skin and eyes upon contact.",
    "Put each of the minced tissues with 10 mL of the prepared digestion mix into a 50 mL tube and incubate in a 37 °C warm water bath for 1 h under permanent agitation. During digestion invert the tubes several times.\nNOTE: One should consider adjusting the digestion volume according to the size of the minced skin piece. Do not overload 10 mL digestion mix with too much tissue otherwise the cell yield will be minimal. Less than one third of tissue within the total volume is recommended (1:2 w/v).\n5. Preparation of Single Cell Suspension and Erythrocyte Lysis\nStop enzymatic tissue digestion by adding 10 mL fibroblast medium (DMEM with L-glutamine, 10% FCS and 1% P/S) to the digested tissue. Work on ice from here on.\nPour the contents of each tube through a regular sterile stainless tea strainer and collect cell suspension in a clean Petri dish. Wash the strainer with medium and mash undigested tissue pieces with the edge of a syringe-plunger.\nAfterwards, pipette collected cell suspension through a 70 µm cell strainer into a 50 mL tube. Rinse the cell strainer with medium and collect flow through into the same tube.\nCentrifuge tubes at 500 x g at 4 °C for 10 min. Remove and discard supernatant and wash cell pellet with 5 mL fibroblast medium. Repeat the centrifugation step.\nRemove and discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL self-made ACK erythrocyte lysis buffer (0.15 M NH4Cl, 10 mM KHCO3, 0.1 mM Na2EDTA; pH 7.2‒7.4). Leave cells in lysis buffer for approximately 1 min at ambient temperature (20‒22 °C).\nStop lysis by adding 9 mL of 1x PBS with 10% FCS and centrifuge the tubes again at 500 x g at 4 °C for 5 min. Discard the supernatant.",
    "CAUTION: The incubation time in erythrocyte lysis may be adjusted if the lysis seems incomplete (red pellet). However, do not leave the cells in erythrocyte lysis buffer for too long to avoid lysis of fibroblasts and immune cells.\n6. Blocking and Staining Fibroblasts for FACS\nPrepare 5 µL of human Fc-receptor blocking solution in 100 µL of 1x PBS with 10% FCS and resuspend cells in 100 µL of human Fc blocker. Incubate on ice for 10 min.\nDesign a FACS staining panel to stain human dermal fibroblasts. Mix anti-human FAP APC (1:20), anti-human CD90 AF700 (1:30), anti-human E-cadherin PE (1:20), anti-human CD31 FITC (1:30), anti-human CD45 Pacific blue (1:20), anti-human ITGA6 PE (1:20), anti-human CD235ab Pacific blue (1:1,000) and anti-human CD106 Pacific blue (1:100) in 1x PBS with 10% FCS.\nAfter Fc receptor blocking, spin cells down at 500 x g at 4 °C for 3 min. Remove and discard the supernatant and resuspend cells in 100 µL of antibody mix. Incubate cells in the dark at 4 °C for 20 min.\nPrior to staining, remove 20 µL of a sample with a high cell number for unstained and single stain FACS controls.\nWash the stained cells and FACS controls twice with 500 µL 1x PBS with 10% FCS and centrifuge at 500 x g at 4 °C for 3 min. In the meantime, add 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to 1x PBS with 10% FCS to make a final concentration of 1 µg/mL.\nRemove and discard supernatant, resuspend cells in 200 µL DAPI solution and filter each cell suspension through a 70 µm cell strainer into a 5 mL FACS tube.\nNOTE: If FACS is going to be performed with delay, add DAPI and filter shortly before recording.\n7. Gating Strategy for Human dermal Fibroblast Subset Isolation and FACS",
    "Record flow cytometry controls, set correct voltage settings and perform the appropriate compensation. Gate for single cells and live (DAPI-), Pacific blue, PE and FITC negative cells (CD45-, CD31-, CD235ab-, CD106-, ITGA6- and E-cadherin-) to get three fibroblast populations: FAP+CD90-, FAP+CD90+ and FAP-CD90+ cells. See Figure 3.\nSort three fibroblast subpopulations into separate 1.5 mL screw cap microcentrifuge tubes filled either with 350 µL lysis buffer for RNA isolation or filled with 350 µL fibroblast growth medium (see the Table of Materials) for cell culture. Invert tubes immediately after the sort and either put lysis buffer tubes into liquid nitrogen for snap freezing or put medium tubes on ice.\nCAUTION: Prepare lysis buffer with 0.1% b-Mercaptoethanol in fume hood and avoid inhalation.\n8. Culturing of Fibroblasts and Adipogenesis Assay\nFollowing FACS, spin cells down at 500 x g for 3 min at 4 °C and plate equal cell numbers (5,000‒10,000 cells/well) in fibroblast growth medium (see the Table of Materials) in 48-well cell culture dishes. Leave cells to grow until they reach 70% confluency.\nAdd 5 µg/mL insulin, 5 µM troglitazone, 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) and 1 µM dexametasone to fibroblast growth medium to prepare adipocyte differentiation medium.\nReplace medium of the cultured cells with adipocyte differentiation medium and let cells differentiate for 14 days. Exchange medium after day 2 with reduced adipogenesis medium containing 5 µg/mL insulin and 5 µM troglitazone. Replenish medium every 3rd or 4th day.\nFix cells with 4% PFA for 20 min at ambient temperature (20‒22 °C) at differentiation day 14. Wash wells with 60% isopropanol and let it evaporate completely. Stain cells with 5 mM Oil Red O (filter prior to use) for 20 min. Wash stained cells four times with distilled water. Proceed to perform microscopy.",
    "CAUTION: PFA is toxic and harmful. Handle carefully.\nNOTE: The protocol can be paused here. Fixed cells can be stored in 1x PBS at 4 °C until Oil Red O staining is performed. Cover dish with paraffin film prior to storage to avoid evaporation.\nImage cells immersed in water with an inverted microscope at 10x magnification with transmitted light."
