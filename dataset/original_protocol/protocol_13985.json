    "The patient gave written and oral informed consent to use medical data and the operative video for education and scientific purposes. This research was performed in compliance with all institutional, national and international guidelines for human welfare. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this manuscript and any accompanying images.\n1. Positioning\nPlace the patient on a vacuum mattress in a supine French position (legs split). Lower the right arm alongside the body on an arm support and extend the left arm. Tilt the operating table 10-20° in anti-Trendelenburg and 5-10° to the left.\n2. Robot docking\nAfter Verres needle insufflation on Palmers' point, introduce four 8 mm robot trocars (R1-4) in a semi-curved line just above the umbilicus. The distance between the trocars is 6-7 cm: R1 in the right anterior axillary line, R2 in the right midclavicular line, R3 just right and above the umbilicus (camera) and R4 just medial in the left midclavicular line.\nIntroduce two assistant 5 mm trocars 3-4 cm below to the left (vessel sealing device) and right of the umbilicus.\n3. Mobilization\nMobilize the hepatic flexure of the colon using robotic diathermia or laparoscopic sealing device.\nIntroduce the liver retractor from the left and retract the liver from segment III and IV. This enables optimal exposure of the surgical site. Optionally, it could suspend the stomach.\nIdentify the gastrocolic ligament and divide it with the vessel sealing device, hence opening the lesser sac.\nContinue the mobilization from lateral to medial until the hepatic flexor of the colon is freed.",
    "Perform Kocher's maneuver until the left renal vein is identified. Hereafter, dissect the right gastroepiploic vein free and ligate using a vessel sealer. Both steps are optional but improve exposure and control which may be useful in case of bleeding from the pancreatic head.\nRetract the pancreas and duodenum with the third robotic arm to entirely expose the abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava.\nIdentify the right gastroepiploic vein and divide it with the laparoscopic sealing device and clips.\nMobilize the pancreatic head using the cautery hook.\n4. Intraoperative ultrasonography\nIntroduce the ultrasonography probe and identify the trajectory of the pancreatic duct and the intra-pancreatic lesion.\nDemarcate the lesion with the cautery hook, with help of the ultrasonography probe.\n5. Dissection\nPlace a traction suture through the lesion.\nLift the lesion up with the traction suture and enucleate the lesion circumferentially with the diathermic scissors.\nCut a finger from a sterile surgical glove and introduce it into the abdominal cavity. Put the enucleated tissue in the finger and extract the specimen. The roof of the pancreatic duct is visible at the bottom of the enucleation site.\nCut a finger from a sterile surgical glove and insert a dry sealant patch. Introduce the finger into the abdominal cavity. Position the sealant patch on the defect in the pancreatic parenchyma. Place two wet 10 x 10 cm gauzes on top and remove the gauzes after 3-5 minutes, the sealant patch remains on the pancreatic head.\n\tNOTE: The sealant patch should not be made wet before positioning. Placement of a patch is optional; studies did not demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing the risk of pancreatic fistulas.\n6. Drain placement\nIntroduce a 18-20 French drain from the right side of the patient and advance it over the pancreatic head.",
    "Test produced drain fluids for amylase levels on the first and third postoperative day postoperatively to test for post-operative fistula. Consider placement of a stent in the pancreatic duct if the amylase level consistently exceeds 3 times the upper limit of the institutions normal serum amylase9."
