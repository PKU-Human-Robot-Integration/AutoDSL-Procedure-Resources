    "Primary hippocampal neurons used in these experiments were harvested16 from embryonic day 17 Wistar rat embryos of either sex under the ethical guidelines of the University of Helsinki and Finnish law.\n1. Sample preparation\nOn high-fidelity glass coverslips, allow rat hippocampal neurons to grow in sparse culture conditions (~5,000-10,000 cells/cm2) for 14 days (14 days-in-vitro).\n\tNOTE: Using sparse cultures reduces the chances of overlapping neurites, which helps quantify the MPS.\nFix neurons using 4% paraformaldehyde for 12 min at room temperature. Wash the coverslip once in 0.2% BSA in PBS (BSA-PBS), then incubate for 10 min in a 1% solution of Triton-X in PBS at room temperature. Wash once in BSA-PBS.\nDilute anti-ankyrin G antibodies (1:200) in BSA-PBS. Add antibody solution to the coverslip and incubate overnight at 4 °C. Optionally, add chicken anti-MAP2 antibodies (see Table of Materials) to the antibody solution to demarcate the somato-dendritic domain.\nWash cells once in BSA-PBS, followed by 0.1% Triton-X in PBS, then do a final wash in BSA-PBS.\nDilute fluorophore-tagged anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:200) (see Table of Materials) in BSA-PBS, add to the coverslip, and incubate for 1 h at room temperature. Wash the cells once in BSA-PBS, once in 0.1% Triton-X in PBS, then once in PBS.\nPrepare a 1 µM solution of tagged phalloidin in PBS (see Table of Materials) and add it to the cells. Incubate for 2 h at room temperature. Wash cells once in PBS, once in 0.1% Triton-X in PBS, then once in PBS.\n\t​NOTE: AlexaFluor488-tagged phalloidin was used here, but other tags will also work.\nFor mounting the coverslip on a glass slide, apply a drop of mounting media on a glass slide, dip the coverslip in deionized water, and dab using a soft paper towel (to remove excess water).",
    "Place the coverslip on the glass slide. Incubate at room temperature for 24 h.\n\t\t​NOTE: No adverse effects on the sample were observed using hard-setting mounting media (refractive index 1.47 after curing).\n2. Imaging\nIf possible, consult with the microscopy facility's personnel before imaging. Use an immersion oil calculator (see Table of Materials) to select the immersion oil suitable for the sample.\nOnce the samples are ready, ensure the coverslips are clean and clear of any residue or excess mounting media. If necessary, use a cotton tip dipped in water or ethanol to clean. Place the sample in a 3D SIM-capable microscope (see Table of Materials) and find a cell to image.\nAdjust the power of the relevant laser lines and the exposure times to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio without significantly bleaching the sample.\n\tNOTE: A good signal-to-noise ratio will show a clear grid-like appearance focused on the sample and lead to accurate high-resolution reconstructions. 488 nm and 640 nm laser lines were used to visualize F-actin and ankyrin G, respectively.\nSet the upper and lower limits of the sample in the z-dimension and proceed to acquire a stack.\n\tNOTE: z-step size of 125 nm was used here.\nFor successful SIM reconstruction, ensure that the microscopy software (see Table of Materials) has an optical transfer file (OTF) suitable for the used dyes.\n\tNOTE: These are typically created and maintained by specialized personnel. In the absence of a functional OTF, open-source tools are also available to perform reconstructions based on estimates17. In this work, up-to-date OTF files were used controlled by specialized personnel.\nRun the reconstruction algorithm on the stack to obtain a super-resolved reconstruction. Check the reconstructions for known artifacts and, if necessary, adjust the parameters to correct them.",
    "NOTE: The default algorithm parameters typically give accurate results. Many of these artifacts involve some repeating patterns: striped lines along with multiple directions on one z-plane, 'ghosting' (repeated features appearing in various z-planes), or a hexagonal 'honeycomb' pattern emerging in some areas. These artifacts can often be fixed with better sample preparation, a better signal-to-noise ratio, adjusting the parameters of the reconstruction algorithm, or ensuring the refractive index of the chosen immersion oil is suitable for the mounting medium and sample. For a more detailed discussion of SIM artifacts and a freely-available tool to check for the presence of artifacts, see Ball et al.18\nCompare the SIM reconstruction to a wide-field image to observe improvements in resolution.\nWhen performing multi-color SIM, use the alignment algorithm to align the different channels correctly once a satisfactory reconstruction is ready.\n\t​NOTE: The alignment algorithm uses an alignment reference file generated using a microsphere bead preparation as per the instruction of the microscope manufacturer.\n3. Image analysis\nActin rings in the MPS have a distinctive periodic appearance. Using image analysis software (see Table of Materials), create a maximum intensity projection image using all the focal planes where actin rings are visible.\nOn the maximum intensity projection image, draw a perpendicular line across visible adjacent rings and record the fluorescence intensity along with the software's line 'Plot Profile' function.\nTo calculate the mean inter-peak distance, note the local maxima in the line profile and measure the distance between individual adjacent fluorescent intensity peaks.\n\tNOTE: This can be easily calculated, for example, using the 'findpeaks' function in MATLAB or the (open-source) GNU Octave platform.",
    "To evaluate the colocalization of different proteins with actin rings in the MPS, run a colocalization analysis procedure19,20,21 on SIM reconstructions of actin and the candidate protein. Manually draw a selection to define the AIS as a region of interest for the EzColocalization plugin in the software platform19 and run the analysis to calculate the Pearson's coefficient of correlation (PCC) of co-localization19,20,21. A PCC value close to 1 indicates strong colocalization.\n\tNOTE: This protocol is summarized in Figure 1.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
