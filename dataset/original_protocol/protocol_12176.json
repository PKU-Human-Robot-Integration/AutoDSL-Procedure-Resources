    "1. Build tsMARCM-ready Flies Using the Required Transgenes11,13\nGenerate the original version of tsMARCM-ready flies from transgenes that are carried by individual flies11 (see Table 1). Conduct standard fly genetic crossing schemes, which have been described previously, by putting multiple transgenes in the same fly stocks13.\n\t\nIn one parental line, assemble the transgenes of FRT40A, UAS-mCD8::GFP (the first reporter, mCD8::GFP; expression of the transgene is under the control of the upstream activation sequence promoter, which produces a membrane-tethered reporter of mouse cluster of differentiation 8 protein fused with green fluorescent protein), and UAS-rCD2RNAi (the suppressor that inhibits the expression of the second reporter; the RNAi against the expression of rat cluster of differentiation 2, rcd2) on the left arm of the 2nd chromosome. Place tissue-specific-GAL4 driver on the X or 3rd chromosome, if possible.\nIn the other parental line, assemble the transgenes of FRT40A, UAS-rCD2::RFP (the second reporter, rCD2::RFP; the other membrane-tethered reporter consisting of rCD2 protein fused with red fluorescent protein), and UAS-GFPRNAi (the suppressor that inhibits the expression of mCD8::GFP; the RNAi against the expression of gfp) on the left arm of the 2nd chromosome. Place heat-shock (hs)-FLP or tissue-specific-FLP on the X or 3rd chromosome, if possible.\nGenerate the new version of tsMARCM-ready flies from transgenes that are carried by individual flies14 (see Table 1). Conduct standard fly genetic crossing schemes, which have been described previously, by putting multiple transgenes in the same fly stocks13.",
    "In one parental line, assemble the transgenes of an FRT site and UAS-mCD8.GFP.UAS-rCD2i (a combined transgene of mCD8::GFP and the suppressor that inhibits the expression of rCD2::RFP) together in the same arm of the 2nd or 3rd chromosome (appropriate pairs of transgenes of FRT and UAS-mCD8.GFP.UAS-rCD2i are indicated in Table 1). Place tissue-specific-GAL4 driver on chromosomes other than the chromosome of the chosen FRT site, if possible.\nIn the other parental line, assemble the transgenes of an FRT site and UAS-rCD2.RFP.UAS-GFPi (the other combined transgene of rCD2::RFP and the suppressor that inhibits the expression of mCD8::GFP) in the same arm of the 2nd or 3rd chromosome (appropriate pairs of transgenes of FRT and UAS-rCD2.RFP.UAS-GFPi are indicated in Table 1). Place hs-FLP or tissue-specific-FLP on chromosomes other than the chromosome of the chosen FRT site, if possible.\n2. Cross tsMARCM-ready Flies to Generate tsMARCM Clones in Their Progeny\nCross tsMARCM-ready flies together (e.g., put 10-15 male flies from step 1.1.1 or 1.2.1 and 20-30 virgin female flies from step 1.1.2 or 1.2.2 together) in a fly-food vial with fresh-made yeast paste on the wall of the vial.\nMaintain the crossed tsMARCM-ready flies at 25 °C for 2 days to enhance the chance of mating before collecting fertilized eggs.\nFrequently transfer the crossed tsMARCM-ready flies into freshly yeasted vials to avoid crowding (tap down the flies or use carbon dioxide to anesthetize the flies to facilitate the transfer; keep no more than 80-100 fertilized eggs in a 10 mL fly-food vial to avoid too many hatched larvae).",
    "Culture the tsMARCM animals (i.e., fertilized eggs; an example of the genotype of tsMARCM animals, as used in Figure 3, is hs-FLP[22],w/w; UAS-mCD8::GFP,UAS-rCD2RNAi,FRT40A,GAL4-GH146/UAS-rCD2::RFP,UAS-GFPRNAi,FRT40A; +; +) that have been laid in the serially transferred vials at 25 °C until they develop to the desired stages (e.g., embryos, larvae, or pupae).\nPlace the transferred vials that contain tsMARCM animals at the same developmental stage to a 37 °C water bath for 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 min to determine the optimal time of heat-shock that induces the expression of FLP to generate the tsMARCM clones of interest. Skip this step if tissue-specific-FLP is being used in the tsMARCM experiment (hs-FLP is preferred for neural lineage analyses; the reasons for this preference have been described previously15).\n\tNOTE: Repeat step 2.5 using the optimal time of heat-shock in future tsMARCM experiments if more tsMARCM clones of interest are wanted; generally, more FLP expression is induced in hs-FLP[22] compared to hs-FLP[1] with the same heat-shock time.\nCulture the heat-shocked tsMARCM animals at 25 °C until they have reached the appropriate developmental stage, and then proceed to step 3.\n3. Prepare, Stain, and Mount Fly Brains Containing tsMARCM Clones\nPrepare forceps-protection dishes. Mix part A (30 g) and part B (3 g) of the Silicone Elastomer Kit with activated charcoal (0.25 g). Pour the mixture into the appropriate dishes.\nDissect larval, pupal, or adult brains out of the tsMARCM animals in 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) using forceps on a forceps-protection dish viewed through a dissection microscope. NOTE: A protocol for fly brain dissection has been described previously16.\nFix the fly brains in a glass spot plate with 1x PBS containing 4% formaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min. Process the fly brains in this glass spot plate for the remainder of the steps.",
    "Rinse the fly brains three times with 1% PBT (1x PBS containing 1% Triton X-100) and wash them three times for 30 min each in 1% PBT (rinse: remove PBT and add new PBT quickly; wash: remove PBT, add new PBT, and incubate the fly brains in the new PBT using an orbital shaker).\nIncubate the fly brains with the mixture of primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C or for 4 h at room temperature. An example of the mixture of primary antibodies is rat anti-CD8 antibody (1:100), rabbit anti-DsRed antibody (1:800), and mouse anti-Bruchpilot (Brp) antibody (1:50) in 1% PBT containing 5% normal goat serum (NGS).\nRinse the fly brains three times with 1% PBT, and then wash them three times for 30 min each with 1% PBT.\nIncubate the fly brains with the mixture of secondary antibodies overnight at 4 °C or for 4 h at room temperature. An example of the mixture of secondary antibodies is goat anti-rat IgG antibody conjugated with green-fluorescent dye (1:800), goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with yellow-fluorescent dye (1:800), and goat anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated with far-red-fluorescent dye (1:800) in 1% PBT containing 5% NGS.\nRinse the fly brains three times with 1% PBT, and then wash them three times for 30 min each with 1% PBT. Mount them on a micro slide with an anti-quenching reagent. Put a micro cover glass on the micro slide to cover and protect the fly brains. Seal the edges of the micro cover glass and micro slide using clear nail polish. Store these mounted and sealed fly brain specimens at 4 °C.\n4. Take, Process, and Analyze Fluorescent Images of tsMARCM Clones\nCapture fluorescent images of tsMARCM clones from the samples created in step 3.8 using the confocal microscopy system of choice.",
    "Project stacks of tsMARCM confocal fluorescent images into two-dimensional, flattened images using the image processing software supplied with the confocal microscopy system of choice (see Figure 3B-3E, 3G-3J, 3L-3O, and 3Q-3T for examples of flattened confocal fluorescent images).\nCount the cell number of the multi-cellular-NB sides of the tsMARCM clones using an appropriate image processing software (e.g., the \"Cell Counter\" function in ImageJ17; see Figure 3E, 3J, 3O, and 3T for examples of the cell bodies of neurons).\nSubscription Required.
