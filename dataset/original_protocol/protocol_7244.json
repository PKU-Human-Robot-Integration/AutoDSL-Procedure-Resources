    "Preparation of Salmonella Typhimurium (S.tm) stockTake an aliquot of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344 expressing red fluorescent protein (RFP) from -20°C storage.Thaw the aliquot at room temperature.Pipette 10 µL of S.tm into 10 mL of LB-medium in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask.Cover the top of the flask using tin foil.Incubate in a shaking incubator at 200 rpm and 37°C overnight.The following day, pipette 50 µL of the overnight culture into 10 mL of fresh LB-medium into a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask.Discard the overnight culture of S.tm. Wash and sterilize the 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask.Cover the top of the flask using tin foil.Incubate the culture in a shaking incubator at 200 rpm and 37°C for 1–2 h.Calibrate a photometer, using 500 µL of LB-medium in a disposable cuvette as blank.Measure OD600, to check if S.tm reached 0.5.S.tm reaches the optimal logarithmic growth phase when OD600 is between 0.5–0.7.Note: If the OD600 value is below 0.5, continue the incubation of the culture in the 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask as described above, until an OD600 value of 0.5 is reached. Of note, S.tm density duplicates every 20 min. If the OD600 value is above 0.7, dilute the culture 1:1 with LB-medium, and incubate it in the 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask, until an OD600 value of 0.5. Transfer the culture into a 50-mL conical tube.Centrifuge the S.tm culture at 4,967 × g at room temperature for 5 min.Discard the supernatant.Resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of freshly prepared LB-medium + 30% glycerol.Prepare aliquots of 50 µL in 0.5-mL Eppendorf tubes, and store them at -20°C.Culture of S.tm to the optimal growth phaseThaw one aliquot of the S.tm stock.Pipette 10 µL of this aliquot into 10 mL of LB-medium in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask, and cover the top of the flask using tin foil.",
    "Incubate in a shaking incubator at 200 rpm and 37°C overnight.The following day, pipette 50 µL of this overnight culture into 10 mL of LB-medium in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask, and cover the top of the flask using tin foil.Discard the overnight culture of S.tm. Wash and sterilize the 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask.Incubate in a shaking incubator at 200 rpm and 37°C for 1–2 h.Calibrate a photometer, using 500 µL of LB medium in a disposable cuvette as blank.Measure OD600 to check if S.tm reached 0.5, which is equivalent to the optimal logarithmic growth phase.Note: If the OD600 value is below 0.5, continue the incubation of the culture in the 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask as described above, until an OD600 value of 0.5 is reached. Of note, S.tm density duplicates every 20 min. If the OD600 value is above 0.7, dilute the culture 1:1 with LB-medium, and incubate it in the 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask, until an OD600 value of 0.5. Counting viable S.tm using a Casy counting systemUse the 45-µm capillary.Measure the background by placing a new Casy cup with 10 mL of fresh Casy ton buffer under the measuring unit.Select the program for background measurement (Table 1 Background Measurement).Measure the background. This should be below 30 counts and 1 µm in size. Otherwise, wash the system.Prepare a new Casy cup with 10 mL of Casy ton buffer, and add 5 µL of S.tm OD600 0.5.Shake gently.Place the sample under the measuring unit.Select the program for measuring between 1–3 µm (Table 1S.tm Measurement).Measure.Click next, to get the number of viable counts/mL = viable S.tm /mL.Note: Viable counts from a freshly prepared S.tm culture with an OD600 of 0.5 should be between 2.5 × 108–3 × 108 viable counts/mL.",
    "After the measurement is finished, remove the sample cup, and add a fresh Casy cup with 10 mL of Casy ton buffer.Perform Casy Clean up to five times.Select the program for washing (Table 1 Washing Program).After the washing is completed, check the background again.If the background is below 30, the Casy counting system can be turned off. Otherwise, continue the washing.Table 1. Programs CASY TT Counting system table:",

Schematic representation of the experimental setup, showing the generation of bone marrow-derived macrophages and infection with S.tm. The different morphological shapes of uninfected and infected BMDM are visualized in a ScanR Imaging Platform (pictures kindly provided by Demetz E.).Anesthetize a wildtype C57Bl/6N mouse, by intraperitoneally injecting 50 µL of 100 mg/kg Ketamine + 10 mg/kg Xylazine.Note: A video demonstrating the procedure in general can be found at Intraperitoneal Injection in the Mouse: https://researchanimaltraining.com/articles/intraperitoneal-injection-in-the-mouse/[href=https://researchanimaltraining.com/articles/intraperitoneal-injection-in-the-mouse/].Perform euthanization of the deeply anesthetized mouse by cervical dislocation. Therefore, place a large tweezer behind the base of the anesthetized mouse's skull, and pull sharply back on the tail at a 45° angle.Fixate the animal on a Styrofoam panel, and spray the surface of the animal with 75% alcohol.Remove skin and muscle tissue from one leg, by cutting upwards from the heel with sterile scissors.Cut around the femur head.Cut in the middle of the knee joint. Be careful not to damage the bones.Cut the ankle joint.Remove excess muscles with tissue paper.Pull on the upper leg, to remove the femur head from the hip joint.Place the bones into PBS containing 1% penicillin and 1% streptomycin on ice.Move to a laminar flow hood, and perform all steps on ice.Open the ends of the bones, by cutting with a pair of sterile scissors.Place a 40-µm cell strainer on a 50-mL Falcon-tube.Flush out the bone marrow:Use a disposable hypodermic needle and a 5-mL syringe.Fill the syringe with PBS containing 1% penicillin and 1% streptomycin.",
    "Place a needle on one end of the opened bone.Flush the bone marrow out onto the 40-µm cell strainer.Repeat flushing of the bone, until it is completely white.Wash the cell strainer with 10 mL of PBS containing 1% penicillin and 1% streptomycin.Using the plunger of the syringe, strain the cells through the cell strainer.Wash the cell strainer with 10 mL of PBS containing 1% penicillin and 1% streptomycin.Centrifuge the 50-mL conical tube containing your flushed bone marrow at 300 × g and 4°C for 5 min.Dilute Erythrocyte Lysis Buffer 1:10 with double distilled waterDiscard the supernatant.Resuspend the pellet in 2 mL of diluted Erythrocyte Lysis Buffer.Incubate at room temperature for 3 min.Add 15 mL of PBS containing 1% penicillin and 1% streptomycin on top of the Erythrocyte Lysis Buffer.Centrifuge the 50-mL conical tube containing your flushed bone marrow at 300 × g and 4°C for 5 min.Discard the supernatant.Resuspend the pellet in 15 mL of PBS containing 1% penicillin and 1% streptomycin.Repeat steps 24–26.Centrifuge the 50-mL conical tube again, and discard the supernatant.Resuspend the cell pellet in 45 mL of DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, 1% penicillin, 1% streptomycin, and 50 ng/mL recombinant murine M-CSF.Pipette 15 mL of the cell suspension into each of three 20-cm Falcon dishes.Change the medium every second day.On day 5, cells can be harvested (Procedure E).Harvesting and counting of cellsRemove the culture media from the cell culture dishes.Wash the cells twice with 10 mL of PBS.Add 8 mL of DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% L-glutamine.Scrape the cells using a disposable cell scraper.Wash the dishes with another 2 mL of DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% L-glutamine.Transfer the cells into a 50-mL conical tube.Close the tube, and invert the cells 2–3 times.",

Gating strategy for the infected bone marrow-derived macrophages – upper panel, and the uninfected bone marrow-derived macrophages – lower panel. After exclusion of doublets, the leukocytes are described as CD45+. T-cells, B-cells, and NK cells are excluded (CD3–CD19–CD49b–), and macrophages are gated as Ly6G–CD11b+F4/80+. Depending on the research question, there is the possibility to characterize pro-inflammatory macrophages as iNOS-expressing cells, and anti-inflammatory macrophages as ARG1–expressing cells. Furthermore, macrophages containing S.tm are characterized by expression of the red fluorescent protein (RFP) in the PE channel."
