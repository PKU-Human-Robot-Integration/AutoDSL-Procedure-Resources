    "1. Growing A. thaliana Plants\nSow A. thaliana seeds in 5 cm x 5 cm disposable pots filled with standard soil mix. Put 32 of these pots into a plastic tray filled with water (~ 0.5 cm depth) and transfer the plastic tray with the plants into a plant growth chamber.\n\t\nSet the growth chamber settings as follows: 200 µmol/ms photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), 24 ± 1 °C day and 21 ± 1 °C night, 60% humidity, and 14/10 h day/night light regime, respectively.\nThin each pot to leave only one individual plant after one week of germination. Take note to keep the seedlings with similar size in each pot.\nWater the pots by pouring tap water directly on the plastic tray once every two days. Grow the plants for four weeks. A. thaliana plants are ready for further use.\n2. Synthesis and Characterization of PNC\nWeigh 1.08 g of cerium (III) nitrate and dissolve it in 2.5 mL of molecular biology grade water in a 50 mL conical tube.\nWeigh 4.5 g of poly (acrylic) acid and dissolve it in 5 mL of molecular biology grade water in a 50 mL conical tube.\nMix these two solutions thoroughly at 2,000 rpm for 15 min using a digital vortex mixer.\nTransfer 15 mL of ammonium hydroxide solution (7.2 M) to a 50 mL glass beaker.\nWhile stirring at 500 rpm, add the mixture from Step 2.3 dropwise to the ammonium hydroxide solution and stir at 500 rpm at room temperature for 24 hr in a fume hood.\nCover the beaker with a piece of paper to avoid the substantial loss of solution during the overnight reaction.",
    "After 24 h, transfer the resulting solution to a 50 mL conical tube and centrifuge it at 3,900 x g for 1 h to remove any possible debris and large agglomerates.\nTransfer this 22.5 mL of supernatant solution into three 15 mL 10 kDa filters and fill the remainder of the filter with molecular grade water to make a total dilution of 45 mL.\nPurify the supernatant solution from free polymers and other reagents with a benchtop centrifuge by adding the supernatant to a 15 mL 10 kDa filter and centrifuge at 3,900 x g for 15 min. Repeat this step at least six times.\nMeasure the absorbance of the eluent in each cycle with a UV-VIS spectrophotometer from 220-700 nm to ensure no free polymers and other reagents are present in the final PNC solution.\nTake the collected PNC solution into the 5 mL syringe and filter it against a 20 nm pore size syringe filter. Collect the filtered PNC solution in a 50 mL conical tube.\nTake a diluted final PNC solution in a plastic cuvette and measure its absorbance with the UV-VIS spectrophotometer from 220-700 nm. PNC absorbance peak is at 271 nm.\nCalculate its concentration by using Beer-Lambert's law: A = εCL. A is the absorbance of the peak value for a given sample, ɛ is the molar absorption coefficient of PNC (cm-1 M-1), L is the optical path length (cuvette width, 1 cm in this method), and C is the molar concentration of measured nanoparticles.\nMeasure the hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of the synthesized PNC using a particle size and zeta potential analyzer (Figure 1).\nStore the final PNC solution in a refrigerator (4 °C) until further use.\n\tNOTE: Please refer to Wu et al.8 for more protocol details about PNC characterization.",
    "3. Labeling PNC with DiI Fluorescent Dye\nMix 0.4 mL of 5 mM (58 mg/L) PNC with 3.6 mL of molecular biology grade water in a 20 mL glass vial and stir at 500 rpm.\nAdd 24 µL 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate dye solution (DiI, 2.5 mg/mL; dilute in DMSO) into 176 µL of DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) to make the DiI dye solution.\nAdd the DiI dye dropwise to the PNC solution, stirring at 1,000 rpm for 1 min at ambient temperature.\nTransfer this resulting mixture into a 15 mL 10 kDa filter and fill the tube to the top with molecular biology grade water to make the total dilution 15 mL.\nPurify the DiI labeled PNC (DiI-PNC) solution from DMSO and any possible free DiI dye by a benchtop centrifugation with the 15 mL 10 kDa filter at 3,900 x g for 5 min.\n\t\nRepeat Step 3.5 at least five times.\nFilter the final DiI-PNC solutions through a 20 nm pore size syringe filter.\nMeasure the absorbance of final DiI-PNC by UV-VIS spectrophotometry and calculate its concentration according to Beer-Lambert's law (Figure 2). See Step 2.13 for more details.\nStore it in a refrigerator at 4 °C for further use.\n4. Infiltration of Plant Leaves with PNC\nAdd 0.1 mL of infiltration buffer (100 mM TES, 100 mM MgCl2, pH 7.5, adjusted by HCl) into 0.9 mL of 0.5 mM PNC or DiI-PNC solution and vortex it. Use a solution of 10 mM TES infiltration buffer as a negative control.\nTransfer 0.2 mL of the PNC or DiI-PNC infiltration solution to a 1 mL sterile needleless syringe. Tap to remove any possible air bubbles.\nRetrieve the plant from the growth chamber just before infiltration with nanoparticles to avoid possible stomata closure under room light conditions.",
    "Before infiltration, measure the chlorophyll content from A. thaliana leaves with similar size using a chlorophyll meter. Measure each leaf with three replicates (each replicate consisting of at least three measurements)14. Choose the A. thaliana leaves with similar chlorophyll content for the infiltration experiment.\nInfiltrate the leaves slowly with the recently prepared PNC or DiI-PNC solution by gently pressing the tip of the needleless syringe against the bottom of the leaf lamina (abaxial side) and depress the plunger (Figure 3A).\nGently wipe off the excess solution that remains on the surface of leaf lamina (Figure 3B) using a delicate task wiper (Figure 3C) and label the plant. Use new delicate task wipes for each group of leaves.\nKeep the infiltrated A. thaliana plants on the bench for leaf adaptation and incubation with PNC or DiI-PNC for 3 h.\n\tNOTE: Infiltrated A. thaliana plants are then ready for further use (Figure 3D).\n5. Preparation of Leaf Samples for Confocal Microscopy\nRoll a pea-size amount of observation gel to about a 1 cm radius (Figure 4A) and then spread it out until it is 1 mm thin on a glass slide (Figure 4B).\nUse a cork borer (diameter 0.3 cm) to cut out a circular section at the center of the observation gel on the glass slide (Figure 4C).\nFill the cut well entirely with perfluorodecalin (PFD) for deeper and better confocal imaging resolution in leaf tissues.\nUse a cork borer (diameter 0.2 cm) to collect leaf discs from the adapted DiI-PNC infiltrated A. thaliana plants (Figure 4D).\nMount the leaf disc in the PFD filled well; face the infiltrated (abaxial) side of the leaf up.",
    "Put a square coverslip on top of the leaf disc and gently press on the slide coverslip evenly to seal it with the well of observation gel and ensure no air bubbles remain trapped (Figure 4E).\n6. Imaging DiI-PNC in Leaf Tissues by Confocal Microscopy\nUse a 40X objective lens in an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope.\nDrop two to three drops of ddH2O on the top of the 40X objective lens.\nPlace the prepared DiI-PNC infiltrated leaf sample slide on top of the inverted 40X objective lens.\n\t\nMake sure the coverslip side but not the glass slide contact directly with the ddH2O on the lens.\nFind a region of interest in the sample under the microscope with either laser light or bright field.\nStart the microscope software and turn on the Argon laser (set at 20%).\nSet the pinhole to collect an optical slice less than 2 µm and a line average of 4.\nImage the sample with confocal microscope settings: 514 nm laser excitation (30 %); Z-Stack section thickness: 2 µm; PMT1: 550-615 nm (for DiI-PNC imaging); PMT2: 700-800 nm (for chloroplast imaging).\nTake representative confocal images of leaf samples from different individuals, a minimum of three biological replicates.\n7. Imaging PNC in vivo ROS Scavenging by Confocal Microscopy\nPrepare 25 µM 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA, a dye for indicating a general ROS) and 10 µM dihydroethidium (DHE, a dye for indicating superoxide anion) dyes in TES infiltration buffer (pH 7.5) in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes, separately.\nUse a cork borer (diameter 0.2 cm) to collect leaf discs from the adapted PNC infiltrated A. thaliana plants.\n\t\nUse the sharp tip of the forceps to make three to four holes on the leaf discs to accelerate dye loading process.",
    "Transfer the leaf discs to microcentrifuge tubes with H2DCFDA and DHE separately and incubate for 30 min under darkness.\nAfter incubation, rinse the leaf discs with ddH2O three times and mount it into the glass slide with observation gel (see Protocol Section 5).\nPut the slide on the confocal microscope and manually focus to a region of leaf mesophyll cells. See Protocol Section 6 for details.\nExpose the leaf discs to the UV-A (405 nm) laser for 3 min to generate ROS and record the ROS signal intensity change in time-series (\"xyt\") per leaf disc.\nImage the leaf disc with confocal microscope settings: 40X water objective; 496 nm laser excitation; PMT1: 500-600 nm (for DHE and DCFDA dye detection); PMT2: 700-800 nm (for chloroplasts detection). Use a plant infiltrated with only infiltration buffer solution as the negative control.\n8. PNC Scavenging of H2O2 in vitro\nConduct the CAT (catalase) mimetic activity of the synthesized PNC in vitro by following the methods in previous publications3,8,15\nAdd 45.4 µL of 1x TES infiltration buffer (10 mM TES, 10 mM MgCl2, pH 7.5, adjusted by HCl), PNC (60 nM, 3 µL), and H2O2 (2 µM, 1 µL) into a well (white round bottom 96 well plate), and gently mix it by pipetting.\nAdd 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine (working concentration 100 µM, 0.5 µL) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP; working concentration 0.2 U/mL, 0.1 µL) into the well, gently mix it by pipetting, and incubate it for 30 min. 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine reacts with H2O2 and is converted into resorufin in the presence of HRP.\n\t\nWrap the plate with aluminum foil to avoid light during the incubation.\nPrepare a negative control by using reaction buffer or water to replace H2O2.\nExcept for the stock solution, prepare all other solutions at ambient temperature.",
    "After the incubation, with a plate reader, monitor the absorbance at 560 nm to use resorufin for indicating the level of H2O2. Set time regime at 0, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
