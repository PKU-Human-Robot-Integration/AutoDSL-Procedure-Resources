    "1. Aseptic practices\nPersonnel gowning for a cleanroom space\n\tNOTE: This procedure is based on initial gowning in an unclassified space, followed by entry into an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 8 area and then an ISO7 area. This procedure is relevant for laboratories attempting to convert existing space into a cleanroom function. Ideally, all initial gowning would occur in an ISO8 classified space (not in an unclassified space).\n\t\nSecure loose hair. Wash hands, and change into scrubs (long-sleeve scrub tops and full-length scrub pants are preferable). Gather and change into cleanroom shoes with shoe covers on.\nSanitize the hands using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer initially and then again between each of the following steps: donning non-sterile gloves and then a beard cover (for any amount of visible facial hair), if applicable. Don a non-sterile bouffant, and cover the forearms with non-sterile sleeves if long-sleeve scrub tops have not been used.\nRemove the shoe covers, stepping onto the tacky mat in front of the ISO8 anteroom door with each foot after the shoe cover has been removed. Ensure the entire foot makes contact with the tacky mat prior to entry. Discard the shoe covers, and decontaminate the gloves and door handle with 70% sterile isopropyl alcohol (sIPA). Enter the ISO8 anteroom.\nGather a sterile hood, sterile face mask, sterile coveralls, sterile boot covers, and safety glasses. Decontaminate the gloves with 70% sIPA. Don safety glasses, and stage the materials onto a clean surface, as per step 1.5.",
    "Don a new pair of non-sterile shoe covers over the dedicated cleanroom shoes, and step onto the tacky mat in front of the secondary anteroom. Make sure the entirety of each foot makes contact with the tacky mat. Decontaminate the gloves with 70% sIPA. Gather the staged gowning supplies, and enter the secondary ISO7 anteroom, remaining on the dirty side of the demarcation line.\nDon the sterile hood and the sterile coverall, touching only the inside of the gowning material and ensuring the neck of the hood is tucked inside the coverall to create a complete seal. Don the secondary sterile boot covers. Decontaminate the gloves with 70% sIPA in between each donning step.\nVerify that the gowning has been donned appropriately, decontaminate the gloves with 70% sIPA, and enter the ISO7 space.\n\t\tNOTE: Periodically inspect the gowning material for integrity. If compromised, exit the cleanroom immediately and re-gown.\nDonning for a biological safety cabinet (BSC)\n\t\nGown as per step 1.1 above with these additional practices.\nGather sterile gloves and sterile sleeves. Clean the BSC as per step 1.4, and stage the materials as per step 1.5. Decontaminate the gloves with 70% sIPA.\nAseptically don sterile sleeves over the coverall, using thumb loops if present. Don sterile gloves over existing gloves, ensuring the cuff of the glove extends over the sterile sleeve. Decontaminate the gloves with 70% sIPA between each step. Enter the BSC.\n\t\tNOTE: Periodically inspect the gowning material for integrity. If compromised, exit the cleanroom immediately and re-gown.\nDoffing of the gowning materials\n\t\nExit the BSC, and carefully remove the top pair of gloves and sterile sleeves. Decontaminate the inner gloves with 70% sIPA.",
    "Enter the secondary and then primary anteroom, waiting for the door to close fully between each step. Remove the materials in the following order: outer sterile boot covers, coverall, hood, and face mask.\nExit the primary anteroom, and remove the non-sterile gowning.\n\t\tNOTE: The order of removal in the unclassified space is not important; however, the inner non-sterile shoe covers should remain on the cleanroom shoes for storage in non-classified spaces.\nSanitize the hands using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and return to street clothes.\nCleaning the cleanroom surfaces and the BSC\n\t\nAssemble a handheld cleaning mop, or obtain a clean low-lint wipe. If using a low-lint wipe, fold the wipe into quarters, and rotate between each surface. Saturate the mop head or low-lint wipe with an approved disinfectant.\nWorking from back to front (or top to bottom), clean the BSC using overlapping wipes in the following order: the HEPA diffuser grill (the top of the BSC), the back wall of the BSC, both side walls of the BSC, the sash, and the work surface. Finally, wipe the sash of the BSC using 70% sIPA to remove any residual disinfectant. Refer to Figure 1 for a typical BSC cleaning pattern.\nStaging materials and equipment into classified environments\n\t\nDecontaminate (i.e., stage) all the materials requiring transfer from a non-classified or lower-classified area to a higher-classified area (e.g., from an ISO8 to ISO7 space) to minimize the transfer of microbes. The transfer of materials between areas of the same ISO classification level does not require staging.\n\t\tNOTE: If the materials have been terminally sterilized and are in multiple bags, remove the outer bag/pouch, and move the material into the classified space; wiping of the internal bag/pouch is not required.",
    "Obtain a low-lint wipe, and fold the wipe into quarters to rotate to a clean side as the wipe becomes soiled. Saturate the wipe with 70% sIPA or an approved disinfectant.\nWipe the exterior of the material/equipment using overlapping wipes. Ensure all the areas of the item are wiped, including the insides of pull-apart package seals and nooks/indents on the equipment and other irregularly shaped supplies. For equipment on wheels, ensure the entire wheel has been wiped during the staging process (the equipment may need to be gently tipped to allow the wheels to be rotated).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65209/65209fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Example of a BSC cleaning pattern. Working from back to front (or top to bottom), clean the BSC using overlapping wipes in the following order: the HEPA diffuser grill (the top of the BSC), the back wall of the BSC, both side walls of the BSC, the sash, and the work surface. Finally, wipe the sash of the BSC using 70% sIPA to remove any residual disinfectant.

Environmental monitoring (EM)\nViable surface sampling\n\t\nStage the materials needed for the sampling session as per step 1.5, and gown into the classified space as per section 1.\n\t\tNOTE: The surface sampling should be performed prior to the air sampling at any specified location. If using multiple plates to surface-sample an area, do not sample the exact same location. Use contact plates to sample flat surfaces only to ensure full contact and to avoid potential damage to the agar.",
    "Collect and label one tryptic soy agar with lecithinase and tween (TSALT) plate and one Sabouraud dextrose agar with lecithinase and tween (SABLT) plate for each sampling site. Holding the bottom of the plate with one hand, aseptically remove the lid, being careful not to touch the raised agar surface.\nTouch the raised agar to the surface being sampled, ensuring that the entire surface is in contact, and apply firm pressure to the plate. Leave the plate in contact with the surface for at least 5 s.\nCRITICAL: Do not move the plate laterally over the surface being sampled, as this can spread potential growth over the surface area, making the resolution of individual colonies difficult. Do not exert excessive force on the contact plate during sampling, as the agar surface may crack.\nAseptically replace the cover, being careful to not touch the raised agar surface. Lock the cover in place if the contact plate has a locking system. Clean the sampling area with 70% sIPA to remove any residual medium from the surface. Loosely bag the plates, and incubate the cultures as described in Table 1. A representative image showing growth of three colony forming units (CFUs) with two distinct colony morphologies on a TSALT surface sampling plate is illustrated in Figure 2. Figure 3 shows contamination of a TSALT plate with growth on the edge of the plate, attributable to poor aseptic technique during sample collection.\nViable air sampling\n\t\nStage the materials needed for the sampling session as per step 1.5, and gown into the classified space as per section 1.",
    "Collect and label one tryptic soy agar (TSA) plate and one Sabouraud dextrose agar (SAB) plate for each sampling site. Prepare the air sampler by aseptically removing the sampling head by gripping only the outside edge to avoid contaminating the head.\nHolding the sampling head in one hand, aseptically place the medium into the plate holder on the sampler. If there is a prong that is longer than the others, insert the medium against the longer prong first, and then push the plate down into the remaining prongs to secure the plate.\nAseptically remove the plate lid, and place it on a cleaned surface out of the way until the sampling has been completed. Aseptically replace and secure the sampling head, gripping only the outside edge to avoid contaminating the head. Repeat steps 2.2.2-2.2.4 for the remaining medium if using a multi-headed air sampler.\nPlace the air sampler in the sampling location with the sampling heads facing in the predominant direction of the airflow movement. Ensure the exhaust from the non-viable air sampler (if sampling simultaneously) does not interfere with the viable sampler. Ensure that the air sampler is set to the validated settings, and start the sampling cycle.\nWhen the sampling cycle has been completed, aseptically remove the sampling head from the sampler by gripping only the outside edge to avoid contaminating the head. Hold the sampling head in one hand, and aseptically replace the lid of the agar plate. Remove the plate from the plate holder. Loosely bag the plates, and incubate the cultures as described in Table 1.",
    "Disinfect the sampling head and the area around the plate holder with 70% sIPA. Aseptically secure the sampling head, gripping only the outside edge. Repeat step 2.2.6 and step 2.2.7 for the remaining medium if using a multi-headed air sampler.\n\t\tNOTE: Figure 4 shows a TSA active air sampling culture with growth caused by a contaminated sampling head. Conversely, Figure 5 represents a TSA active air sampling culture with no growth. Air impact indents from the sampling head can be seen on the image.\nNon-viable sampling\n\t\nPerform a zero check on the laser particle counter prior to the sampling activities for each day of use. Attach the isokinetic head to the sampling port of the particle counter either directly or affixed to a length of tubing as needed for the sampling location.\nIf tubing is applied, use a short length, because tubing >1 m long can cause problems with enumerating particles of ≥1 µm and may also lead to unnecessary bends in the tube. Ensure the particle counter is set to the validated settings. It is recommended to set a delay of approximately 30 s to allow exit from the sampling area to avoid airflow disruption during sampling.\nPosition the laser particle counter's isokinetic head in the sampling location with the isokinetic head facing into the predominant direction of airflow movement. Ensure the exhaust from the viable air sampler (if sampling simultaneously) does not interfere with the non-viable sampler. For areas where the airflow is not unidirectional or the airflow pattern is unknown, ensure the isokinetic head faces vertically upward.\n\t\tNOTE: If rotational disinfectant or 70% sIPA has been aerosolized near the air sampler, wait at least 5 min before starting the sampling cycle.\nStart the sampling cycle, and slowly exit the sampling area to avoid disrupting the airflow.",
    "CRITICAL: Do not aerosolize liquids near the air sampler during a sampling cycle, as this will cause high non-viable counts.\nWhen the sampling has been completed, retrieve the laser particle counter. Record the average particle counts for 0.5 µm. Some facilities may also track and trend 5.0 µm.\nRepeat the steps 2.3.3-2.3.6 for the next sampling location. If moving between rooms or BSCs, wipe the outside of the non-viable particle sampler with 70% sIPA or an approved disinfectant. Avoid getting disinfectant inside the isokinetic head, as this could lead to inaccurate particle counts.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\nCategory,Media,Culture conditions,Culture conditions,Culture observation,Culture observation,Culture observation,Results,Results,Results,Results",
