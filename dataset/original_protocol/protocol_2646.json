    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSamples pretreatment\nTiming: 3 days\nThe removal of lipids is important for effective clearing of tissues and to allow the penetration of external chemicals and molecules. It is mainly achieved by the application of detergents. It is a solvent-based dehydration step.\nDehydration and decolorization.\nIncubation in increasing series of methanol/water washes: 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%, 100%, 1 h at each stage, without shaking, at RT and protected from light.\nIncubation in DiChloroMethane (DCM)/Methanol 2:1, overnight at RT with shaking.\nBleaching.\nDo 2× 1 h-rinsing in methanol 100% at RT without shaking and then store in the fridge at 4°C.\nPrepare 5% H2O2 in methanol, and place at 4°C.\nIncubate the brain in the H2O2/methanol solution overnight (about 15 h), at 4°C.\nNote: H2O2 is utilized in this context for clearing the brain and wash blood vessels. See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2303-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Mouse brain before and after bleaching\nRehydration.\nRehydrate your sample by washing in decreasing amounts of methanol: 80%, 60%, 40%, 20% and PBS-1×. One hour for each wash at room temperature.\nAlternatives: You can skip this phase (samples pretreatment) if the primary antibody is not suited for methanol treatment (for further details see antibodies validation in the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section).\nNote: 15 mL Falcon tube can be used for all steps 1, 2 and 3.\nPause point: After rehydration, samples can be stored in a PBS-0.01 M solution (PBS-1×) at 4°C for up to one month. Beyond this time store the sample in PBS 1×- 0.02%. sodium azide solution.\nTissue permeabilization and blocking\nTiming: 5 days\nThe permeabilization step increases porosity and helps in the penetration process of antibodies.\nPlease note that the blocking step prevent non-specific binding of primary antibodies to the tissue.\nPermeabilization.",
    "Incubate your sample in a PBSGT + Glycine 0,3 M: 1.13 g of glycine in 50 mL of PBSGT solution, during two days (48 h) (1 day (24 h) for ≤ P7 brains) at 37°C under shaking (30 rpm).\nNote: The apparatus used for this step is shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2303-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Incushaker and Falcon tubes\n(A) Incushaker to incubate sample on shaking at 37°C.\n(B) Falcon tubes, (15 mL) elongated in the incushaker.\nBlocking.\nIncubate the sample in PBSGT + 5% NGS (500μL NGS qsp 10 mL PBSGT) during three days (72 h) (1,5 days (36 h) for ≤ P7 brains) at 37°C in a shaking mode (30 rpm).\nNote: Due to differences in brain size during early postnatal development, reduce the incubation time for blocking and permeabilization by two. See Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2303-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Mouse brains at several postnatal ages\nThe brain at P14, is similar in size to the adult brain and can be handled with the similar procedure (duration, concentration). Ruler from 1 to 10 cm.\nOptional: Additionally, wash twice, 60 min each time, in PBSGT, 0.1% saponin with 10 mg/mL of heparin.\nNote: For these steps (4, 5), you can use falcon tube 15 mL, and work with a 15 mL volume. See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nImmunostaining\nTiming: 3.5 weeks\nThis section describes the labeling process. We have used the oxytocin and vasopressin primary antibodies to target axonal fibers and cell bodies. Then we use secondary antibodies to bind the primary ones. Each secondary antibody contained a fluorochrome in 568 nm or 647 nm. At the end of immunostaining, cell bodies containing oxytocin and vasopressin appear fluorescent when imaged with the light sheet microscope.\nPreparation of the antibody solution.",
    "Prepare a mixture of PBSGT, 1% NGS and 0.1% saponin (100μL of NGS + 10 mg saponin qsp 10 mL PBSGT).\nPrimary antibody incubation.\nIn the previous solution, incubate the antibodies at the required concentration. We used two different combined antibodies: (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section antibodies double staining):\nanti OXT (Host Rabbit) 1/400 with anti AVP-NPII (Host Mouse) 1/500.\nanti AVP (Host Rabbit) 1/400 with anti OXT-NPI (Host Mouse) 1/500. Incubate the brains on shaking (30rpm) at 37°C: 3 weeks for adults, 2 weeks for P14 and P7, and only one week for P3 and P0.\nNote: To save antibodies, place the brains in the incushaker in a 5 mL Eppendorf tube tilted on the side (2 mL Eppendorf tube until P7, fill with 1.5 mL solution) as shown in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]. We obtained 5μL of anti OXT/anti AVP + 4μL of anti OXT-NPI/anti AVP-NPII, qsp 2 mL with antibody solution.\nNote: Correct antibodies concentration can be assessed by preliminary tests using different concentration. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section antibodies concentration.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2303-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Antibodies incubation\nBrains incubated in 2 mL antibodies solution, in 5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nIn a 15 mL falcon tubes rinse 6 × 1H in PBS-1×, at RT on shaking (30 rpm).\nSecondary antibody incubation.\nPrepare a mixture of PBSGT, 1% NGS and 0.1% saponin (100μL of NGS + 10 mg saponin qsp 10 mL PBSGT).\nPrepare the final solution, with the required concentration of antibodies. In our study we used the Goat Anti-Rabbit 568 nm and the Goat anti-Mouse 647 nm at 1/800, for a final volume of 2 mL.\n2.5 μL of Goat Anti-Rabbit 568 nm and 2.5 μL of Goat anti-Mouse 647 nm, qsp 2 mL with antibody solution. Incubate at 37°C, on shaking (30 rpm) during 2 days (48 h).",
    "Critical: After the staining step as well as during the clearing and storage phase, cover the sample with a foil. This will ensure that the fluorescence labelling is protected from light.\nIn 15 mL falcon tubes rinse 6 × 1H in PBS-1×, at RT on shaking (30 rpm).\nClearing\nTiming: 2 days\nThis section describes the procedure to obtain transparent sample before imaging with the light sheet. This is obtained by matching the refractive index of the sample with the refractive index of the imaging solution (See also the Renier et al.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nDehydration.\nIncubation in increasing series of methanol in water washes: 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%, 100% (or overnight in the last washes), 1 h each step, without shaking, at RT and protected from light.\nDelipidation.\nNote: For the delipidation and refractive index matching, use 15 mL corning falcons.\nIncubation in DCM/Methanol 2:1, during 3H at RT on shaking.\nWash two times (15 min each time) in DCM, on shaking.\nRefractive Index Matching.\nIncubate in DiBenzyl Ether solution and wait until samples become transparent. See Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2303-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Brains before (left) and after (right) clearing\nImaging\nTiming: 3 h\nThis section describes the procedure for imaging whole brain cell fluorescence with the light sheet microscope. Oxytocin and vasopressin cell bodies were imaged, the data was stored as tiff files and then 3D reconstruction and analysis were performed.\nImaging.\nSet the laser power (excitation 568 nm for oxytocin and 647 nm for vasopressin) around 20% for the 568 nm and 30% for the 647 nm, with a 150 ms time of exposure.",
    "Note: Set source lasers at 25% powered at 16.6 mW. The light sheet numerical aperture is 0.156 (thickness 5 μm), with a width of 70%. Our Ultramicroscope II has 2× objective lenses, with a zoom from 0.63 to 6.3 (1:10). The total magnification is 1.26×-12.6×.\nFor the adult brain, scanning hypothalamic regions in coronal plane (see Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]) (from the anterior commissure to the median eminence, see Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]A); we used a step size of 2 μm and an optical zoom of 1.6.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2303-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Light-sheet sample holder\n(A–C) For the coronal acquisition, place the brain with the anterior part facing upwards while the dorsal part is in contact with the screw.\n(D) The cuve is filled with DBE.\n(E) Dip the sample holder into the cuve of the microscope.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2303-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. Cell detection and clustering with Imaris\nScale bar 200 μm.\n(A) 3D representation of the OXT and AVP staining, in coronal view.\n(B) OXT cell detection and region clustering.\n(C) AVP cell detection and regions clustering.\nNote: Optical zoom 1.6 correspond to 1.89 μm resolution in x and y. To obtain a cubic voxel, the step size must be set with the same value than the microns size in x and y.\nNote: Use step size 1,51 μm and optical zoom 2 for P14 and step size 1,21 μm with 2.5 optical zoom for P0, P3 and P7.\nFor cell quantification, data acquired in the regions of interest, resulted in voxel size of 0.479 μm3, 0.604 μm3, or 0.75 μm3.\nCell counting\nTiming: 3 days",
    "In this section, we report how to analyze oxytocin and vasopressin cell network. From light sheet microscope generated tiff files create a 3D file, then perform the quantification as described below. Excel files containing data such as cell size or fluorescence intensity can be obtained for all cells.\nConversion to 3D files: With the Imaris converter, you can export 2D tiff images (from the light sheet microscope) to a 3D ims file.\nWe performed automatic cell detection with Imaris software as well as through manual checking. For both global and region-by-region cell detection (as illustrated in Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10] for ParaVentricular Nucleus) use the Imaris spot detection module.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2303-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10. Oxytocin cells in the paraventricular nucleus detected with the Imaris software\nScale 50 μm.\n(A) Unbox the spot size option (to set the cell size in step 2), and unbox the region of interest (or keep this option and design your ROI).\n(B) Choose the correct channel (here OXT 568), set the diameter size and check the box background subtraction.\n(C) Automatic detection obtained with the Imaris tool counting.\n(D) Example of false detection: in blue outside the region (i.e., Medial Preoptic Area), in yellow false positive.\nSet the cells diameter to 10 microns and start the detection for each channel, OXT and AVP, separately.\nCarefully check each spot to ensure that there is not any missing cells or false positives (i.e., vesicles or axons).",
    "To process hypothalamic cells, we first performed a global count using the cell counting tool. We then carried out a manual identification of cells in the hypothalamic nuclei. We identified six OXT and AVP cell clusters in the Paraventricular (PVN), Supraoptic (SON), Tuberal (TU) and Medial Preoptic (MPO/MPN) Nuclei as well as in the Bed Nuclei of Stria Terminalis (BNST), and Medial Amygdala (MeA) and in two OXT-specific regions, the Antero Lateral Preoptic (ALPO) and Periventricular (PvPO) areas. Cell coordinates were than mapped into Allen Brain Atlas with a resolution of 1.89 μm3.\nFor each region, cell counts were performed using the following size parameters: 0.479 μm3, 0.604 μm3, or 0.75 μm3 voxel. Cells not included in the region of interest were discarded (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]C below). Density analysis within the PVN was conducted by extracting position and fluorescence intensity of each cell."
