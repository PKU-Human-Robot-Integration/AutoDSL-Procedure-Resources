    "Preliminary requirementsDesign of feeding apparatus (Figures 1A and 1B): This includes a cylindrical food container with a hole in its lid, a small food vessel and an aluminum tray for collecting spilled food.Identical plastic containers must be used. Lids should be sufficiently flat for mouse to sit on top and consume food. The lid of each plastic container is drilled at the center to make a hole of 1 cm diameter. Holes must be of the same diameter in all the containers. Bottom container is filled with bedding material leaving ~1 cm at the top. A small cylindrical food vessel of ~1 cm height is filled with powdered food and kept inside the bottom container. The lid is tightened on top of the food vessel aligning their centers vertically. Food should be accessible through the hole in the lid. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171101/20171101004134_6825.jpgFigure 1. Design of food apparatus (A, B) used during food consumption session (C); During food consumption and social interaction session (D), the test cages were covered with a transparent Perspex sheet (E). All observer mice are provided with powdered food in two identical sets of food apparatuses during preference tests. A. Components of food container include a food vessel filled with powdered food (powdered food not shown) that rests within the bottom container. The lid is modified by drilling a hole of 1 cm diameter at its center to provide access to food. B. Bottom container is filled with bedding material leaving just enough space to place the food vessel on top. C. Mice consuming food from one of the food containers during a preference test. Both food containers are identical in every aspect of their design. If spilled food gets mixed with bedding material in the cage, it is extremely hard to account for during estimation of net consumption.",
    "To minimize such unaccountable spill during consumption, each feeding apparatus includes a custom-built aluminum tray to hold the food containers. The food containers are softly glued to the center of the metal tray with a small piece of double-sided adhesive tape. D. Social interaction between observer and demonstrator mice. Demonstrator mice are identified by a hole in their ear pinna. E. Side view of a test cage covered with a transparent Perspex sheet to avoid mice from escaping while video monitoring. Two rows of holes meant for air circulation are visible close to the center of transparent Perspex sheet covering the cage.A small piece of double-sided adhesive tape (1 x 1 cm) is attached to the center of spill collection tray. After weighing the food containers, they are fixed to the spill collection tray. Spill collection tray was made by bending thin metal sheet. Its dimensions can be decided according to the test cage. Note: Size and position of feeding hole on all the lids need to be same, in order to make sure that accessibility to food is uniform for all mice. For black coat mice, all the spill collection trays and lids for food containers can be painted white to provide the best contrast for video analyses. Containers are temporarily labeled at the bottom with their flavor and their weights are noted with respect to their position in each test cage.Cage assembly and video recording set upTest cages with bedding material are arranged in a matrix on the floor/low table in the experiment room. Depending on the number of mice, one could use 3 x 3, 3 x 4 or 4 x 4 matrix to arrange test cages. It is important to place visual block between all the transparent/translucent cages in order to avoid visual distractions across mice.",
    "We placed cardboard sheets (15 cm high, 3 mm thick, length as per the cage arrangement) to maintain complete visual block between test cages during the experiment. Test cages are covered with transparent Perspex sheets (Figure 1E) for multiplexed video recording of all the cages in top-view (Figures 1C and 1D). Each Perspex sheet has small holes (3-5 mm diameter) drilled along the short central midline for air circulation (Figure 1E). A webcam is mounted at ~4 ft height using a customized stand such that each test cage is covering an equivalent area in the field of view and all cages are in focus. Note: Any reflection from transparent Perspex cover on test-cages can be avoided by using well-directed lighting and/or a polariser.Steps for the procedureOur STFP behavior protocol has been explained in ten steps including 1) Weaning, 2) Random paired co-housing of two mice in single cage, 3) Handling, 4) Segregation of paired mice as observer and demonstrator, 5) Habituation (5-7 days), 6) Pre-STFP preference test (1 day) for Identification of less preferred flavor as to-be-demonstrated flavor, 7) Feeding respective demonstrator mice on to-be-demonstrated flavor, 8) Social interaction (1 day), 9) Post-STFP preference tests (1 day each) at recent time-points, 10) Post-STFP preference tests (1 day each) at remote time-points (Figure 2). Pre-STFP preference, Social interaction and Retrieval tests were all performed in the same room but on different days. All animals were housed in individually ventilated cages to prevent the unwanted transfer of olfactory, auditory or visual cues between demonstrator and observer mice across sessions. If individually ventilated cages are not available, holding and testing rooms must be separate. Clean-air circulator and exhaust outlets were kept open continuously to prevent odor retention of previous sessions. Clean-air inlet was turned off during the experimental sessions for one hour.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171101/20171101004407_9122.",
    "jpgFigure 2. Modified protocol for STFP with mice. Each step is numbered and explained in detail in this procedure section. P–plain powdered food (without added flavor), A, B–flavors used during the experiment, IPF–innately preferred flavor, RFA–restricted food access (mice were provided with 1 g food pellet daily in addition to the consumption during habituation/testing sessions). Weaning 3-4 weeks old male mice are separated from the mother based on their size and health. Randomly paired housing In our protocol, paired housing begins with weaning. Randomly paired two animals are co-housed in a cage just after weaning and kept together until the beginning of habituation sessions. Habituation sessions begin after a minimum of four weeks from weaning. A week after weaning, one of the co-housed animals is ear marked to be the demonstrator. Handling Co-housed animals are handled for about a week before separation. Proper handling helps in reducing anxiety in both animals and the experimenter during behavior. Handling protocols followed in different labs are mostly similar with few modifications depending on the cohort. We are listing down handling steps which we followed while considering the anxiety levels of both the novice animals and the experimenter. Note: Each animal is handled for ~10 min daily for 3-5 days in the room where the experiment will be conducted. Day 1 Gently lift the animal while holding the tail closer to the body. Rest the body on other hand for 20-30 sec while both the hands are within the home cage. Release back in the cage gently. Repeat 3-5 times at an interval of ~30 sec depending on anxiety of the animal. Note: Animals within a cage can be handled with same pairs of gloves as they are familiar with each other’s odor.",
    "It is important to change gloves while handling animals from a new cage. Gloves should be changed across cages even if there is no/minimal excretion from previous cage animals. Day 2 Repeat day 1 procedure while resting the animal for 60-90 sec on palm. Always change gloves for seemingly anxious animals even if they are cage mates of relatively non-anxious animals. Day 3 Repeat day 2 procedure while allowing the animal to walk around for ~2-3 min while positioning the palms just above the cage. Try to make sure that animal lands in cage if it jumps. Follow same glove change rule as of day 1 and day 2.Note: In case animal jumps and lands out of the cage (on floor/table), gently lift the animals, keep them back in cage and resume handing only the next day for such animals. Prior arrangements should be made to make all the hiding corners inaccessible for the loose mice. Day 4/5 Repeat the steps followed on day 3. If animals seem anxious or ‘jumpy’, repeat over following days. Usually, most of the animals get rid of their anxiety within 4-5 days of handling.Separating Co-housed animals: Co-housed animals are separated and housed individually in different cages just before the beginning of habituation sessions. The same couple needs to be used during all the interaction sessions to avoid fighting and stress. All the individually ventilated cages for holding single animals are kept in the same room.Habituation Habituation allows animals to get adjusted with two main aspects of the paradigm: daily food deprivation of ~15 h and consuming powdered food pellets by climbing on custom-made food apparatus.",
    "Food Deprivation: Food deprivation involves limiting access to food by providing animals with a 1 g solid food pellet daily, in addition to the one-hour food consumption session every day. Food deprivation begins by leaving animals with just a 1 g solid food pellet 24 h before commencing the first habituation session for one-hour of food consumption. Food deprivation schedule is continued from the beginning of habituation sessions until the post-STFP preference test conducted after 24 h. For 17- and 41-day remote preference tests, ~15 h deprivation is started 3 days in advance before the testing day. Water is provided ad libitum, except for one hour of experimentation/habituation session.Preparation, distribution and weighing of food: Regular food pellets are ground before each session. Food was prepared in a ventilation hood with minimum air flow settings.Each food vessel is filled with powdered pellets and enclosed in the food container. Weight of each container is carefully noted down in accordance with its relative position with respect to the test room as frame of reference.Each food container is kept in a light metal-tray custom built for collecting any spilled food. Note: Weights of food containers are noted before and after the session. Spilled food is weighed indirectly as explained in the ‘weighing procedure’ below. Demonstrator mice are given feeding-apparatus within their home cage and allowed to consume food for one hour. Observer mice are first released in the test cage at their respective position. Then two sets of feeding-apparatus are introduced one after another. Some important considerations in order to avoid biased food-distribution are listed in the note below. Note: During habituation, each feeding-apparatus is identical in every aspect including flavor of contained food. So, only variable remains the order of delivery.",
    "We change the order of delivery across cages within the same session as well as across sessions within the same cage. For example, on day 1 of habituation, if cage 1 first receives food at position A and then at position B, we ensure that on day 2, position B is given food before position A. Also, within the same session, we ensure the order apparatus placement is alternated across cages i.e., if cage 1 receives food first at position A and then at position B, we ensure that cage 2 receives food first at position B and then at position A. This pseudo-randomization doesn’t allow mice to prefer any peculiar end within the test cage based on ‘first come, first eat basis’ and makes it easier for them to learn to eat equally from both containers.Weighing Procedure: Weights of food containers are noted before and after the session. Spilled food is weighed indirectly. Any cage litter is removed before weighing the tray. The tray containing spilled food is weighed after the session and its weight is noted. Then the tray is wiped thoroughly to remove any sticking powdered food and weighed again. The difference in these two weights of the tray is noted as ‘spilled food’ and subtracted from the difference of ‘before and after’ weights of the food container to obtain ‘net consumption’. Preference for the flavor A is calculated as the ratio of net consumption from container A vs. total food consumed from both the cups during one-hour session.Day 1 Demonstrator mice: They are provided powdered food in a container in their home cage for 1 h. DemoMice are given food one hour before ObMice. Water is removed during food consumption.",
    "Observer mice:ObMice are individually released in their respective test cage containing bedding material for 1-h long consumption session. Trays containing food container are then placed in each cage while following aforementioned pseudo-randomization process. At the end of the session, all mice are removed from test cages without disturbing the feeding apparatus and kept back in their home cages.All mice are given a solid food pellet weighing ~1 g after the session. This results in daily food deprivation of ~15 h.Feeding apparatuses are individually removed from each test cage, carefully weighed in aforementioned manner to calculate net consumed food and dismantled for a thorough cleaning that involves cleaning with odorless detergent/bleach, washing with warm water and drying in warm air flow.Days 2-7 Same timing is maintained for feeding both DemoMice and ObMice. It is repeated until observer mice begin to consume equal amount of food from both food containers. Position of containers within a test cage is reversed across sessions over multiple days.Pre-STFP preference testPreparation, distribution and weighing of Food:Just before commencing the test session, powdered food pellets are mixed in a required ratio (% w/w) with the commercially acquired flavors. See ‘Recipes’.During preference tests, freshly prepared food of one flavor is filled in the food vessel which is then kept inside the container. Containers with the same flavor are assembled first. The place is thoroughly wiped to remove any traces of previous flavor and remaining vessels are filled with the powdered food containing other flavor and remaining containers are assembled. Steps ‘i to v’ as for observer habituation are followed further.Weighing is conducted in aforementioned manner.ObMice are allowed to consume flavored food from two containers in the test cage kept at their respective positions in the assembly. Complete session is video recorded in addition to the weight measurements.",
    "Based on the weight estimation, each observer mouse is identified as preferring flavor A or flavor B. Choice of flavor at this point most likely represents their innate preference for one of the two flavors. It is noted that during social interaction after 24 h of pre-STFP test, each mouse preferring flavor A during pre-STFP test will be demonstrated with flavor B and vice versa. Since preference for either flavor ranges between 0-1, ObMice having more than 0.5 preference for flavor A will be demonstrated with B and vice versa. There might be some ObMice which consume equal amounts of both the flavors during pre-STFP test. Half of these mice are allotted to flavor A preferring group and the other half to flavor B preferring group. Note: In our experiments, steps 7 (DemoMice feeding) and 8 (social interaction) were most often carried out after 24 h of step 6 (Pre-STFP test). We also tested a scenario when steps 7 and 8 were conducted five days after step 6. Animals need to be given 2 g food pellet daily during the intervening days for maintaining a healthy weight.Demonstrator Feeding: Respective demonstrator mouse from the co-housed pair is fed for 1 h on the flavor which is preferred less during pre-STFP test by the corresponding observer. This feeding takes place in the individually ventilated home cages of demonstrator mice. Social interaction for demonstration of flavor (STFP)At the end of feeding session, demonstrator mice are released in the test cage of corresponding, pre-assigned observer mice for one hour long social interaction. All mice are kept back in their respective home cages at the end of interaction session. Interaction session is also video monitored.",
    "Recent memory test In order to test the change in preference after social interaction, 24 h after social interaction observer mice are provided both the flavors in two cups in their respective test cages (see Video 1). Post-STFP tests follow the same steps as required for pre-STFP preference test.Remote memory test Remote memory for flavor retention can be carried out after 2-4 weeks depending on the requirement.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1.
