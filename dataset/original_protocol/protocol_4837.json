    "Prepare 24-well plates with 13 mm round coverslips at the bottom of the wells. Coat coverslips with matrigel for human embryonic stem cells. Split cells in colonies with a ratio of 1:5 on coverslips. Grow cells for 24 to 48 h.Wash cells with 1 ml PBS per well.Incubate cells for 5 min on ice with 0.5 ml per well of ice-cold CSK buffer freshly supplemented with 0.5% Triton X-100 and 2 mM vanadyl ribonucleoside complex. The core CSK buffer can be kept at 4 °C several months.Fix cells for 10 min at room temperature with 0.5 ml per well of PBS/3% PFA supplemented with 2 mM vanadyl ribonucleoside complex.Rinse cells with 1 ml per well 3 times with cold EtOH (70%) for 4 min.Either proceed to step 8 or the protocol can be stopped here by tightly wrapping the 24-well plate with parafilm, stretching it gently to ensure good fit and avoid evaporation. Cells can be stored at -20 °C for one month.On the day of the experiment, bring coverslips to 4 °C in 70% EtOH.For probe preparation, for each coverslip, add 290 µl of water to 5 µl of concentrated chromosome paint and 5 µl of human Cot-1 DNA (1 µl/µg). Precipitate DNA by adding 1/10 3 M NaOAc and 2.5 volumes of 100% EtOH and storing tubes overnight at -20 °C. Probes are prepared individually for each coverslip: 1 mix for 1 coverslip.Spin probes at 15,000 x g at 4 °C for 20 min. The pellet should be visible and is washed 2 times with 70% EtOH and spun for 10 min at 15,000 x g at 4 °C.Resuspend the pellet in 5 µl of 50% deionized formamide/50% hybridisation buffer (2x), and incubate for 10 min at 37 °C.",
    "Denature the chromosome paint 7 min at 75 °C, incubate for 30 min at 37 °C and store it on ice.In the meantime, dehydrate coverslips in 90% and 100% EtOH for 4 min each. Coverslips are then air dried on Kimwipes, cells face up. Heat clean glass slides on the hybridisation table at 37 °C, where the moats have been prefilled with water.Dispense 5 µl of probe per coverslip on glass slides, and place coverslips on the probe, with cells facing down (Figure 1). Incubate the coverslips at 37 °C overnight, and evaporation around the coverslips is prevented using rubber cement to seal the coverslips to the glass slides.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160829/20160829060305_5076.jpgFigure 1. Manipulating coverslips. A. Putting 5 µl of probe on slides. B. Putting coverslips with cells face down on probe preparation.The next day, remove rubber cement by gently drawing it from the coverslips. Spill 2 ml of 2x SSC over the coverslips and glass slides, and gently start pushing around the coverslips by making them float in 2x SSC. Fully detached coverslips are transferred to 24-well plates for further washes. Wash coverslips 3 times with 1 ml per well of 50% formamide/2x SSC, and 3 times in 2x SSC, all washes at 42 °C. Incubate 24-well plates with coverslips in hybridization oven with low agitation (shaker speed set at medium speed).Mount coverslips on glass sides using 5 µl of mounting medium containing DAPI. Use transparent nail polish to seal the coverslips to the slides.Observe fluorescent signals with a fluorescent microscope (magnification 100x).For dual RNA-FISH involving chromosome paint (Vallot et al., 2015)RNA-FISH is performed in two-steps. First, RNA-FISH with chromosome paint is performed overnight as described above (steps 1-14). Coverslips are washed 3-times in 50% formamide/2x SSC at 37 °C and re-incubated overnight with the second probe.",
    "Coverslips are washed 3-times in 50% formamide/2x SSC and 3-times in 2x SSC at 37 °C. Observe both signals simultaneously.For successive RNA/DNA-FISH with chromosome paint (Vallot et al., 2015)RNA-FISH is performed on slides as described above using a Cy3-labelled paint to visualize RNA, take pictures and note cell coordinates using a stage-motorized Leica microscope. Wash slides, cells are permeabilized for 10 min in 0.1 N HCl/0.7% Triton X-100 on ice, treated with 100 µg/µl RNase in 2x SSC for 1 h at 37 °C. Denature slides for 10 min at 80 °C in 70% formamide/2x SSC. DNA is visualized using a FITC-labelled X chromosome paint, it is denatured for 2 min at 75 °C and incubated with slides overnight. Wash slides 3 times with 2x SSC at 45 °C and 0.1x SSC at 60 °C."
