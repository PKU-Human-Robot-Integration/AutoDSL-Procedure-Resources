    "Scanning bone samples and calibration standardsPreparation of samples: We wrap fixed bone samples in cotton gauze soaked in 70% ethanol, sufficient gauze is used so that the samples sit firmly within the screw-cap tubes and do not move if inverted gently.Scan bones according to your standard method. We scan murine bones at the following settings: 9 μm voxel resolution (or smaller), 0.25 mm aluminium filter, 55 kV voltage, 200 μA current, rotation 0.4°, frame averaging = 2.At the same time, and using the same scanning settings, scan both calibration rods.Reconstruct images using your standard protocol. You may find it helpful to refer to method notes from your manufacturer (e.g., For Bruker instruments, “An overview of NRecon: reconstructing the best images from your microCT scan Method note MCT-062”, available when you register at https://www.brukersupport.com/[href=https://www.brukersupport.com/]). We reconstruct with SkyScan software NRecon using the following settings:Smoothing – 1Object larger than field of view – deselectedRing artefact reduction – 6Beam hardening compensation – 35%CS rotation – automaticThe attenuation coefficient (density) – 0-0.14Define the region of interest for measuring bone structureNote: These instructions describe the process for defining the femoral metaphyseal region. Open sample files in DataViewer.Orientate the sample in all three planes so that it is vertical and symmetrically aligned (Figure 1). Using the coronal plane, manipulate the bone orientation with the mouse while holding ‘Ctrl’. By directing the mouse to the center of the growth plate, the second transverse view can be manipulated so that the bone is orientated with the patella at the top of the image (see Figure 1). Use the sagittal view to align the bone horizontally.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3873/bioprotoc-11-01-3873-g001.jpgFigure 1. DataViewer screen shot showing a femur oriented correctly in all three planes.",
    "Note that each axis (blue and green) lies central in each orientation, and the growth plate is balanced evenly on the red axis.Save a new (transaxial) dataset with the corrected orientation.Open the new correctly oriented dataset in CTan.Measure femur length by identifying the distal and proximal ends of the bone, and the slice containing the growth plate in CTan (Figure 2A). We define the distal end of the bone as the optical slice at which the medial and lateral condyle meet (Figure 2B). We define the proximal end of the bone as the slice where the femoral head and the trochanter first meet (Figure 2C). In the distal femur, we identify the growth plate by identifying the site where the four quadrants of the femoral growth plate begin to merge. As you scroll from the distal end towards the center of the bone, you will notice the presence of four circular quadrants of the growth plate, that enlarge and meet (Figure 2D). The medial and lateral growth plate regions meet first. We call this the first meeting. As you continue to scroll, the anterior and posterior growth plate regions meet. We call this convergence of the growth plate “the second meeting” and define it as the “growth plate” slice. Use the measurement values for each landmark to calculate bone length by subtracting the distal measurement from the proximal measurement (Figure 2E).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3873/bioprotoc-11-01-3873-g002.jpgFigure 2. Measuring femur length and defining a metaphyseal region of interest in CTan. A. Diagram showing the anatomical locations we use to measure femoral bone length. B.

    "Typical images showing how the regions of the growth plate change as you scroll from the distal end (four quadrants) to the first and second meeting points of the growth plate. E. Example of a spreadsheet used to calculate femur length and the region of interest from micro-CT scans. Image in panel A is taken from http://www.informatics.jax.org/cookbook/figures/figure42.shtml[href=http://www.informatics.jax.org/cookbook/figures/figure42.shtml].Calculate the length of the metaphyseal region of interest (ROI) for each sample based on the bone length. We do this so that the same anatomical region is measured in each sample, regardless of whether bone growth is modified. In the original publication using this method, we defined the distal end of the region of interest as the slice at a distance equal to 7.5% of the femur length from the growth plate (see Figure 2A (Walker et al., 2020) for a representation of this region of interest); this normally encompasses the secondary spongiosa. We define the proximal end of the metaphyseal region as the slice located an additional 15% of the femur length from the newly defined top measurement. Calculate these values in Microsoft Excel using the landmarks identified in Step 6, above (Figure 2E).Select the ROI icon to enable a “Region of Interest” drop down menu. From here, select an “elliptical” region that encompasses both trabecular and cortical bone within the top slice. Repeat this for the bottom slice of the ROI. The CTan software will interpolate the ROI for the slices in-between. Manually check the ROI generated on each slice by scrolling through the dataset to ensure that the entirety of the bone is contained within the whole ROI. Save this as a new metaphyseal dataset.",
    "Define four bone density thresholds using the Otsu algorithm in control samplesNote: This should be performed separately for each study, unless you aim to compare volumes of bone at defined densities between studies. In the latter case, ensure that all scanning and reconstruction settings are the same. Using the “Custom Processing” function, create a task list with the following steps:Thresholding: Multilevel (Otsu method), With a 3D space, Number of threshold levels: 4, Select “Inside VOI”, Output color of class thresholding: Mean intensity in class.Save Bitmaps: Select the following options: Image inside ROI, BMP format, Copy shadow projection, copy dataset log file. This will save bitmaps that you can use to check the Otsu-based thresholds if any unexpected results are obtained.Load all samples from your control group, and run the above custom processing using CTAn’s batch manager (BATman). This will generate an output file for each sample that reports 4 Otsu-based thresholds (Figure 3A).Check the BMP files to ensure they correctly represent the amount of bone visualized. You will notice that the images for the lowest threshold will include much non-bone material. This lowest threshold will not be used for analysis of your samples (Figure 3B).Collate the threshold values derived for all the samples in a excel worksheet.Calculate the average threshold values for each level. These newly obtained threshold values will be used to complete the 3-level thresholding for all samples.Use the results from scanning the calibration standards to calculate the equivalent calcium hydroxyapatite levels (g/cm3) represented by your thresholds (Figures 3C, 3D)Note: These are required for reporting, so your levels can be reproduced and understood by other researchers who may be using different instruments (reporting the 0-255 gray levels will not achieve this).",
    "Follow the protocol in “MN009 BMD calibration in CTan ‘HU and BMD calibration in Bruker-MicroCT CT-analyser’ September 2005 page 5-19” (found at https://www.brukersupport.com/[href=https://www.brukersupport.com/]) as follows.In CTAn, under the Binary Selection tab, select the “From dataset” tab. Type in the gray level threshold for Level 2 (in our example is 40). Select the “Bone mineral density” tab in this window and scroll down to find the first BMD value that is not greyed out. In our example, the threshold level 40 corresponds to a mineral density of 0.632 g/cm3 CaHA.Repeat this process for threshold Levels 3 and 4.Note that these values are not universal and will differ if the scanning parameters are changed. Therefore, it is important to scan the phantoms under the same settings when you scan your samples and calibrate CTAn for each analysis.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3873/bioprotoc-11-01-3873-g003.jpgFigure 3.

    "Make a new Custom Processing task list to define the bone area, and the volume of bone at each threshold as follows:Thresholding: Select the following: Global, and add the Level 2 threshold value calculated in Procedure C. In our example it is 40.

Note that the value for Total Area will be identical in all analysis files generated.3D Analysis: Create a .csv file for the results of the low density threshold (Level 2 to Level 3) bone analysis. Save results as both text table and single text line and link the Excel file you just created. This will list the volume of bone (Bone Volume) within the Level 2 and Level 3 thresholds (low density), for all samples. Note that the value for Total Area will be identical in all analysis files generated.Save Bitmaps: Apply ROI, Select the following: BMP file format, Copy Shadow Projection and Copy Dataset log file.
