  "procedures": [
    "1. Day 1: Cell Culture\nCulture the cells to be analyzed to the desired amount. Cell culture conditions and media depend on the cell types under investigation.\n\tNOTE: In principle, any eukaryotic cell is amenable to an analysis of chromatin accessibility by FAIRE. For this experiment, 4 x 106 HEK-293T cells are seeded in a single 10 cm dish in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and 1% (w/v) penicillin/streptomycin, and incubated at 5% CO2 and 37 °C for 24 h until the cells reach 70 - 80% confluence (~ 8 x 106 cells per dish).\n2. Day 2: Formaldehyde Crosslinking and Cell Harvesting\nCAUTION: Formaldehyde is highly toxic and must be always used under a fume hood. Wear protective clothes (gloves and lab coat). Discard the waste appropriately.\nAdd formaldehyde directly to the cell culture medium in a fume hood to reach a final concentration of 1% (v/v) (270 µL of 37% (v/v) formaldehyde to 10 mL of cell culture medium). Incubate for 10 min at room temperature (20 - 25 °C) and slew the plates manually every 2 min.\n\tNOTE: The crosslinking time can be adjusted according to the cell type. For the majority of cell lines, 10 min of crosslinking is adequate. For tissues, longer incubations might be required to allow the fixation of all cells.\nAdd glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 M to quench the formaldehyde (add 500 µL of a 2.5 M glycine stock to 10 mL of culture medium). Incubate for 5 min at room temperature and slew every 2 min.",
    "Wash the cells 3x with ice cold PBS (8 g/L NaCl, 0.2 g/L KCl, 1.44 g/L Na2HPO4 · 2H2O, 0.24 g/L KH2PO4, adjust pH to 7.4 with HCl or NaOH). Aspirate the medium and wash directly in the cell culture dish or flask by adding 10 mL of PBS. Repeat this step twice being very careful in the case of loosely adherent cells such as HEK-293T. Add PBS carefully to the side of the dish in order to avoid detachment of the cells.\nAfter the third wash, resuspend the cell in 1 mL of ice cold PBS and transfer to a 1.5 mL reaction tube on ice. Use a cell scraper to detach the cells when necessary.\n\tNOTE: When starting with a limited material, use low DNA-binding tubes to avoid sample loss during the procedure.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 300 x g at 4 °C in a cooled tabletop centrifuge. Discard the supernatant by carefully aspirating it.\n3. Cell Lysis and Chromatin Fragmentation\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL FAIRE lysis buffer (1% (w/v), 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.1, 10 µg/mL leupeptin, 10 µg/mL aprotinin, 2 mM PMSF), and resuspend the cells by carefully pipetting up and down several times. Incubate for 20 min on ice. Store the samples at -80 °C at this step if needed.\nSonicate the crosslinked DNA to shear it to an average size of 200 - 300 bp. The specific settings of the sonicator must be determined for each source of samples and the used sonication device. In any case ensure that the DNA is efficiently sheared. An optimization step for DNA shearing is described under step 5.14. Cool the samples on ice during sonication to avoid heating of the sample.",
    "Centrifuge the sample for 15 min and 13,000 x g at 4 °C.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new reaction tube. Split the samples in 100 µL aliquots. Store the samples at -80 °C, if needed.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be interrupted at this point.\n4. De-crosslinking of Control DNA\nTake a 100 µL aliquot from step 3.4 to reverse the crosslink and to be used as a reference for total DNA. Add 10 µL of RNase-A (10 mg/mL) and incubate for 1 h at 37 °C.\nAdd 10 µL of Proteinase K (20 mg/mL). Use a programmable thermo-block to incubate for 4 h at 37 °C and then for 6 h at 65 °C to cleave the proteins and to reverse the crosslinks. Finally, hold the samples at 4 °C until the protocol is resumed and then proceed to step 5.\n\tNOTE: Other FAIRE protocols use chromatin samples from cells which have not been crosslinked as reference, thus abolishing the need for de-crosslinking11. The fact that these samples are not crosslinked could lead to differences in the sonication efficiency or in DNA stability, therefore the use of total DNA reference samples that have undergone the same procedure as the test samples is more accurate.\n5. Day 3: Phenol:Chloroform Purification of DNA\nTake the non-de-crosslinked aliquot from step 3.4. Add 10 µL of RNase-A (10 mg/mL) and incubate for 1 h at 37 °C.\nTake the non-de-crosslinked aliquot form step 5.1 and the de-crosslinked sample from step 4.2 and proceed in parallel. Add H2O to reach a final volume of 300 µL.\nAdd 300 µL of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) in a fume hood and vortex vigorously.",
    "CAUTION: Phenol is corrosive and toxic and must be used always under a fume hood. Wear protective clothes (gloves and lab coat), make sure the reaction tubes are tightly closed, and dispose the waste appropriately.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 x g at 4 °C.\nCarefully transfer 280 µL of the upper aqueous phase to a new reaction tube. Make sure not to take any debris from the interphase which also contains proteins. Discard the remaining lower phase as organic solvent waste.\nRepeat steps 5.3 to 5.5 and carefully transfer 270 µL of the upper aqueous phase to a new reaction tube.\nAdd 270 µL of chloroform in a fume hood and vortex vigorously.\n\tNOTE: This step is used to eliminate any remaining phenol from the sample.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 x g at 4 °C.\nCarefully transfer 250 µL of the upper aqueous phase to a new reaction tube, taking care not to carry any debris from the interphase. Discard the remaining sample as organic solvent waste.\nAdd 25 µL of 5 M NaCl and 250 µL of isopropanol. Add 5 µL of glycogen (20 mg/mL) as the DNA carrier. Mix well by inverting the tubes and incubate for 20 min at room temperature. Centrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 x g at 4 °C to precipitate the DNA.\nWash the DNA pellet with 400 µL of 70% (v/v) ethanol. Centrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 x g at 4 °C.\nAspirate the supernatant carefully and let the pellet dry for 10 min at room temperature. Resuspend in 100 µL TE buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8, 1 mM EDTA).\nIncubate the non-de-crosslinked free DNA sample for 4 h at 65 °C to remove inter-DNA crosslinks. Store the samples at -20 °C.",
    "Quantify the amount of DNA using a spectrophotometer and run an aliquot to check the fragment size on a 2% (w/v) agarose gel. Adjust the shearing time and intensities, depending on the results of the DNA size analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis, to obtain an average size of 200-300 bp.\n6. Determination of Free Versus Total DNA by Quantitative Real Time PCR (qRT-PCR)\nThe ratio of nucleosome-free DNA (in the following referred to as free DNA) versus total DNA is determined by qRT-PCR17,18. Samples can also be quantitatively analyzed by microarray hybridization or deep sequencing for genome-wide determinations.\nDesign qPCR primers for the regions to be tested and for positive and negative controls.\n\tNOTE: Suitable positive controls are primers situated in the promoter of actively transcribed housekeeping genes such as ACTB, GAPDH, TPI1, or TUBA1A (encoding β-Actin, GAPDH, TPI or α-Tubulin). Appropriate negative controls are found in heterochromatin regions or gene deserts. Other suitable negative controls can be designed in genomic regions adjacent to the dynamically regulated locus under investigation to control for local copy number differences (Table 1).\nDilute the DNA samples to a final concentration of 10 ng/µL with TE buffer, and take the dilution factor into account for the final calculations (see step 6.5).\nSet up a qPCR reaction in triplicates in a 96-well plate, with the following reaction mix per well: template DNA: 20 ng (2 µL), forward primer 200 nM (0.4 µL of a 5 µM stock), reverse primer 200 nM (0.4 µL of a 5 µM stock), a commercial ready to use reaction mix containing green dye (5 µL from a 2x stock), and H2O to 10 µL.",
    "Run in a real time qPCR device, using the absolute quantification mode, and determine the Ct of the samples with the different primer pairs. Calculate the ratio of recovery of free DNA to total DNA for each primer using the following formula, taking into account the dilution factors from step 6.3:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57272/57272eq1.jpg\n\tRepresentative results and an example calculation are given in Table 2.\nTo compensate for differences among samples, normalize to the positive control recovery ratio:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57272/57272eq2.jpg"
