Dissection of the epididymal white adipose tissue\n(A) The sedated (with isoflurane exposure) animal is euthanized and prepared for dissection. The fur is sprayed with 70% ethanol and the tools are cleaned with disinfectant solution and rinsed with ethanol.\n(B) Make a midline ventral incision (5–6 cm) through the skin with scissors, from the base of the sternum to the base of the tail. Use forceps to peel back the skin from the peritoneal cavity and secure the outstretched skin with dissection pins. The sub-cutaneous fat depot (inguinal WAT) is visible (arrows) and can be harvested if necessary, after removal of the inguinal lymph node.",
    "(C) After the opening of the peritoneal cavity, the adipose tissue surrounding the reproductive system is visible. Other adipose masses are mesenteric (associated with the intestines, arrow) and perirenal (sticked to kidneys, not visible here). Hang on the epididymal adipose tissue with forceps and cut at the base, where the prostate and seminal vesicles adhere. If those are damaged, rinse the tissue with cold PBS.\n(D) A testis, the epididymis and the connecting the duct are associated with the adipose mass.\n(E) Carefully dissociate the testis and epididymis, rinse the adipose tissue with PBS, dry on a clean tissue, weigh on a weighing balance and immediately freeze in liquid nitrogen.\nPlace tissues in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.\nNote: Samples are stored at −80°C until further use.\nTotal mRNA isolation and quality controls\nTiming: 3 h\nThis section describes the steps enabling the preparation and assessment of high quality total RNA from adipose tissue.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2798-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Place pieces in a 2 mL polypropylene tube maintained in ice and add 1 mL cold Trizol (TRI Reagent T9424-200ML). Homogenize with a tissue homogenizer (OMNI International Tissue MASTER 125).\nTransfer homogenates in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube for a first centrifugation (10 min, 4°C, 12,000 g).

In step 3c, 30 min centrifugation must be respected, since a shorter centrifugation time leads to poor phase separation. In step 3d, it is important that purified total RNA is solubilized in nuclease-free water, not in TE or other buffers containing EDTA. Chelation of divalent cations by EDTA will interfere with RNA fragmentation and the efficiency of reverse transcription.\nRNA cleanup and DNase I treatment.\nSee also https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/rna-purification/total-rna/rneasy-kits?catno=74104[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/rna-purification/total-rna/rneasy-kits?catno=74104].\nAdjust the sample to a volume of 100 μL with RNAse-free water.

Close the lid gently, and centrifuge for 2 min at 12000 × g.\nPlace the RNeasy spin column in a new 2 mL collection tube, and discard the old collection tube with the flow-through. Close the lid gently, and centrifuge at 20000 × g for 1 min.\nPlace the RNeasy spin column in a new 1.5 mL collection tube (supplied).

Close the lid gently, and centrifuge for 1 min at ≥8000 × g (≥10,000 rpm) to elute the RNA.\nThe solution is stored at −80°C until further use.\nRNA quality control.\nMeasure the RNA concentrations of samples by spectrophotometry (Nanodrop) using nuclease-free water as blank.",
    "Note: Sample purity is determined using the absorption spectrum and the ratio 260/280 nm absorbance. Samples with a ratio < 1.9 and/or absorption in short wavelengths (230 nm) are considered contaminated and RNA extraction must be performed again, starting at the chloroform (3c) step.\nDetermine the total RNA integrity with the Agilent total RNA Pico Kit on a 2100 Bioanalyzer instrument (Agilent Technologies, Paolo Alto, USA).\nCritical: Only high quality RNA (RIN>8) is used for RNA sequencing.

Working in RNase-free conditions is again of crucial importance for these steps.\nIn this section, the step-by-step procedure to elaborate libraries from total RNA is detailed, followed by the evaluation of their quality.\nLibrary construction.\nLibrary construction is performed with the SMARTer® Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit v2 - Pico Input Mammalian\" (TaKaRa Bio USA, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) with a final multiplexing of 11 libraries.

    "For every sample, perform a quality control test on RNAseq raw data with the NGS Core Tools FastQC (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/[href=http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/]). Map sequence reads using STAR4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] and remap unmapped reads with Bowtie29[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] using the very sensitive local option. The total mapped reads are finally available in a BAM (Binary Alignment Map) format for raw read counts extraction. Generate read counts with the htseq-count tool of the Python package HTSeq6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] with default parameters to generate an abundance matrix. Only genes with a total read count across selected samples superior to 10 are kept. At last, perform differential analyses using the DESEQ27[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] package of the Bioconductor framework. Select up- and down-regulated genes based on the adjusted p-value and the fold-change information. Finally, map the Ensembl gene names to the HGNC gene names with biomart R function.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]\nNote: Since many readers of this protocol might not have a training in advanced bioinformatics, it is also worth mentioning that all these bioinformatic tools (e.g. FastQC, STAR, Bowtie2, HTSeq, DESEQ2 etc.) can be performed using the open-source web-based Galaxy platform.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] Galaxy has all these tools built-in and using them requires no prior training in coding languages, which makes these tools incredibly accessible to all bench scientists.\nRNAseq data interpretation.\nAnalyze gene expression using dedicated R scripts to build volcano plots. Built heatmaps using the online application heatmapper (http://www.heatmapper.ca/[href=http://www.heatmapper.ca/]). Identify pathways with IPA (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, Qiagen). Perform Gene set enrichment using the web-based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit (http://www.webgestalt.org/[href=http://www.webgestalt.org/]). Predict the proportion of immune cell populations that infiltrate the adipose tissue from bulk RNAseq data with the ImmQuant deconvolution software8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]"
