    "Protein-DNA crosslinking   Start a preculture of both tagged and untagged (control) C. albicans strains in 10 ml of rich medium (e.g. Yeast Peptone Dextrose) - allow to grow overnight under vigorous shaking (200 rpm) at 30 °C.   Dilute cells to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600nm) of 0.4 in 50 ml of an appropriate filamentation-inducing liquid medium (e.g. Lee’s medium at 37 °C) and allow to grow under vigorous shaking (200 rpm) until cells reach the equivalent of OD600nm = 1.0 (or typically during 4 h in Lee’s medium at 37 °C).     Add 1.4 ml of 37% formaldehyde to a 50 ml Falcon tube and transfer the culture (48.6 ml) to the Falcon tube. Screw the caps tightly to prevent leakage of formaldehyde-containing liquid.   Place the Falcon tubes in a suitable rack and tape them. Place the rack on the rocker and agitate during 30 min at room temperature (agitation at 45 rpm using the VSR-50 laboratory platform rocker).    Add 2.5 ml of 2.5 M glycine to stop the cross-linking reaction and incubate 10 min with agitation on the rocker.   Centrifuge the samples for 5 min at 3,500 rpm (2,465 x g). Discard the supernatant (containing formaldehyde) in a suitable waste container. Wash the cells 3 times with 10 ml TBS buffer, by agitating, quickly (1-2 min) centrifuging at 3,500 rpm (2,465 x g) and resuspending in 10 ml TBS buffer.     Centrifuge the samples for 5 min at 3,500 rpm (2,465 x g) and discard the supernatant. Using the remaining liquid, resuspend the cell pellets and transfer to a 1.5 ml screw-cap tube.   Briefly centrifuge the samples and remove the remaining supernatant. Snap-freeze samples in liquid nitrogen. Store tubes at -80 °C until use.",
    "Preparing Dynabeads for coupling to antibody (work on ice or in a 4 °C room)   Coupling of Dynabeads to antibody for immunoprecipitation (IP) is made the day preceding the scheduled day for preparing extracts. The main stock of beads is vortexed to resuspend the beads and 50 µl of beads per IP are used.    Transfer the required volume of beads to a 15 ml Flacon tube (e.g. for 6 samples, transfer ~300 µl).   Centrifuge quickly and remove the supernatant.    Wash the beads with 5 ml PBS/0.5% BSA (make a fresh solution, e.g. 0.25 g BSA in 50 ml PBS).   Typically 2 µg of antibody per IP are needed for coupling to the beads at a dilution of 1/10. Resuspend the beads in appropriate volume of PBS/0.5% BSA and add the required volume of antibody at a 1/10 dilution (e.g. for 6 samples and an antibody stock solution at 0.2 µg/µl, transfer 60 µl of antibody to 600 µl of beads resuspended in PBS/0.5% BSA).    Incubate the beads-antibody overnight at 4 °C on a hematology/chemistry mixer.   Quickly centrifuge the 15-ml Falcon tube. Wash the beads-antibody with PBS/BSA 0.5% and resuspend in 30 µl lysis buffer per IP (for 6 samples, resuspend in ~180 µl of lysis buffer).        Preparing total extracts and DNA shearing (work on ice or in a 4 °C room)   Thaw the cell pellets from step 8 on ice and resuspend them in 700 µl of lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail and 1 mM PMSF (1x final each).   Add the equivalent of 0.5 ml PCR tube of glass beads.    Prepare total cell extracts by bead beating using a FastPrep-24 instrument with 6 runs during 1 min each at 6.0 m/sec and 1 min on ice in between (These settings led to efficient breakage of hyphal cells.).",
    "Make sure of efficient cell breakage by examining 5 µl of the FastPrep processed sample under a light microscope.   Punch a hole at the bottom of the screw cap tube containing the total extracts + beads using an 18 G x 1½ inch needle and quickly place it on a clean 2 ml conical tube. The bottom part of the 1.5 ml screw-cap tube carrying the beads + total extracts has to be introduced into the 2 ml microtube.   Quickly centrifuge (spinning pulse from 0 to ~9,000 rpm) the assembled tubes to collect the total extract from the 1.5 screw cap tube in the 2 ml collection tube. Make sure there are no remaining cells adhered to the glass beads in the 1.5 ml screw cap tube.   Resuspend the collected cell debris + extracts in the 2 ml collection tube and transfer to a clean 1.5 ml microtube.    Sonicate the extracts 4 times during 20 sec at power 8 (knob position) for an output signal amplitude of 21 (Microns, Peak to Peak) using a probe sonicator. Try to get ~200 to 300 bp DNA fragments on average (Figure 1).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140613/20140613220704_6406.jpg Figure 1. Optimization of DNA shearing by sonication. Total extracts from step 16 (~700 µl) are sonicated 4 times during 20 sec each with 1 min incubation on ice in-between. 4 different sonication power settings [top; 1, knob position 2 output power 6 (Micron, Peak to Peak); 2, knob position 4 output power 10.5; 3, knob position 6 output power 15; 4, knob position 8 output power 21] are tested to optimize DNA fragment size range.",
    "Condition 4 is the optimal DNA fragment size range for high-throughput sequencing (~100 bp to maximum 500 bp, maximum average size ~300 bp) DNA ladder sizes are indicated at the left of the panel (bp, base pairs).     Centrifuge the sonicated samples at 14,000 rpm during 10 min at 4 °C and transfer the supernatant (This is the whole cell extract, WCE.) to a clean 1.5 ml microtube.      Chromatin immunoprecipitation (work on ice or in a 4 °C room)   Transfer 500 µl of the WCE to a new 1.5 ml microtube and add 30 µl of Dynabeads coupled to antibody from step B9f.    Incubate the Dynabeads-antibody-WCE mixture overnight at 4 °C under rotation on a hematology/chemistry mixer.      Washing and reversing crosslinks    In a cold room (4 °C), place the samples on the DynaMag Spin magnet system to allow separation of the Dynabeads from the WCE. Wash twice with 1 ml lysis buffer, twice with 1 ml lysis buffer supplemented with 360 mM NaCl, twice with 1 ml wash buffer and once with 1 ml TE buffer. For each washing step, put the tubes on the magnet, rotate the magnet + tubes 5-6 times to allow efficient attraction of beads, discard the supernatant, add 1 ml of respective buffer, remove the magnet and vigorously agitate the tubes 30-50 times.     Centrifuge during 2 min at 4,000 rpm at 4 °C and remove the supernatant.   Add 100 µl of TE/SDS solution to the bead pellet. Vortex gently (medium speed) to resuspend and incubate overnight at 65 °C. Vortex for 1 min before leaving at night and vortex again the following morning.  Incubate for another 30 min at 65 °C before proceeding.      DNA purification    Vortex again at medium speed and incubate during 30 min at 65 °C.",
    "Centrifuge at 14,000 rpm during 2 min and transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 ml microtube.   Add a mixture of 295 µl TE, 3 µl of RNase A (stock at 10 mg/ml) and 2 µl of glycogen (from stock at 20 mg/ml). Vortex to mix the samples (400 µl final) and incubate at 37 °C during 2 h.    Add 15 µl of 10% SDS and 7.5 µl of proteinase K solution. Vortex gently and incubate 2 h at 37 °C.   Extract twice with 400 µl phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) by vortexing for 1 min and centrifuging at 14,000 rpm during 10 min at room temperature. Transfer the supernatant from each extraction step to a clean 1.5 ml microtube.   Add 16 µl of 5 M NaCl to the extracted supernatant from step F28 (should be ~350 µl). Vortex then add 2.5 volumes of freezer-cold ethanol (~875 µl). Stored overnight at -20 °C.   Centrifuge at 14,000 rpm during 40 min at 4 °C.   Remove the supernatant and wash with 1 ml of freezer-cold 70% ethanol.   Resuspend the pellet in a convenient volume of H2O (typically 50 µl).   Quantify the IP DNA using the Quant-iTTM PicoGreen® dsDNA Assay Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions.      DNA library generation and high-throughput sequencing   Use 10 ng of IP DNA for library generation. Generate the Illumina library using the TruSeq DNA sample preparation kit v.2 as recommended by the TruSeq DNA sample preparation v.2 guide. Steps include (with some modifications):   End repair as recommended in TruSeq DNA sample preparation v.2 guide (page 43).   Purification of end-repaired DNA with QIAquick PCR Purification kit as recommended by the manufacturer, instead of using Agencourt AMPure XP beads.

Dilute ChIP library samples to 2 nM, denature DNA samples and load onto an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer flow cell lane for single-read (51 base pairs per read) high-throughput sequencing following the manufacturer’s instructions.   The resulting read files (FASTQ) are pre-processed with the online Galaxy NGS data analysis software (Blankenberg et al., 2010; Giardine et al., 2005).",
    "Steps include:   Quality control analyses of the FASTQ files using FastQC version 0.52 on the Galaxy web interface - proceed to clipping of adapter-contaminated sequences using Clip version 1.0.1.   Mapping of the resulting files to the C. albicans assembly 21 genome (http://www.candidagenome.org/download/chromosomal_feature_files/C_albicans_SC5314/[href=http://www.candidagenome.org/download/chromosomal_feature_files/C_albicans_SC5314/]) using the Bowtie algorithm (Galaxy: Click on NGS mapping>Map with Bowtie for Illumina version 1.1.2) - the Assembly 21 of the C. albicans genome can be imported into Galaxy by clicking on User>Custom builds (top window of the Galaxy web interface). Mapping will generate BAM files for processing with peak finding algorithms.     Proceed to peak finding with the generated BAM files using the Model-Based Analysis for ChIP-Seq (MACS) peak-finding algorithm software and following the instructions found on one of the two corresponding detailed protocols (Feng et al., 2012; Feng et al., 2011)."
