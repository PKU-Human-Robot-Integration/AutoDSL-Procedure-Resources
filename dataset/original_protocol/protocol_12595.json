    "NOTE: This protocol is only to be used if students or respective legal guardians agreed to the conductance of this protocol as genotypic profiles give insights into genetic relationships. DNA fingerprinting is a common molecular biology method mainly applied to population studies and forensic matters. Therefore, attention should be devoted to keep contamination risks as low as possible. To avoid contamination of the sample with DNA from an outside source or DNases, gloves should be worn, instruments should be thoroughly cleaned or sterilized and solutions should be filter-sterilized or autoclaved before usage.\n1. Harvesting of buccal mucosa epithelial cells\nCAUTION: Work with saliva and epithelial cells can lead to a transmission of infectious diseases. Therefore, standard and transmission-based precautions should be applied (e.g., the use of appropriate personal protective equipment).\nNOTE: Include a positive control, which is provided by the instructor (e.g., DNA extracted by the instructor) and included in the downstream processing steps.\nWait at least 1 h after eating or brushing teeth before specimen collection.\nLabel an empty and sterile 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nRemove one sterile buccal swab from the packaging and rub vigorously on the inside of the cheek for 30-40 times or 30-40 seconds to harvest buccal mucosa epithelial cells.\nPlace the tip of the collection swab into the previously labeled sterile microcentrifuge tube and break off the length of plastic that extends beyond the edge, either by hand or using sterile scissors.\nPlace the cap securely onto the tube, sealing the collection swab inside.\n2. Extraction of genomic DNA from human cells\nBefore extraction, set a thermal mixer or a heating block to 65 °C for sample lysis.\n\tCAUTION: Some chemicals used are classified hazardous. Read the safety data sheet carefully and take appropriate safety measures before handling.",
    "Prepare and sterilize by filtering or autoclaving all required buffers and solutions (lysis solution, 8 M potassium acetate, 2-propanol, 70% ethanol and elution buffer).\n\t\tNOTE: All centrifugation steps should be performed at room temperature (20-30 °C) unless specified.\nAdd 500 μL of lysis solution (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0; 10 mM ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA); 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)) to the buccal swab, making sure that the sample is completely immersed in the lysis solution.\n\t\nVortex vigorously for at least 5 s.\nIncubate samples at 65 °C in a thermal mixer for 10 min.\nMix sample 3-4 times by pulse-vortexing for 5 s during incubation.\nRemove swab from the lysis buffer, press the swab against the inside of the tube to obtain maximum sample volume.\nAdd 100 μL of 8 M potassium acetate to lysed cells.\n\t\nMix thoroughly by inverting the tube until there is a white precipitate.\nIncubate for 5 min at room temperature.\nCentrifuge the sample for 5 min at 18,000 x g.\nTransfer 450 μL of the supernatant into a clean and sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 450 μL of 2-propanol and mix thoroughly by inverting the tube (precipitation of the DNA).\nIncubate for 5 min at room temperature.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 18,000 x g.\nDiscard the supernatant and invert the tube on a clean paper towel to dry the pellet and to avoid cross-contamination.\nIncubate the DNA for 5 min at 65 °C in a heating block to dry the pellet completely.\nTo wash the DNA, add 500 μL of 70% ethanol.\nCentrifuge for 1 min at 18,000 x g.\nDiscard the supernatant and invert the tube on a clean paper towel to dry the pellet.",
    "Add 30 μL of resuspension buffer (10 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA) to the pellet.\nIncubate the DNA for 10 min at 65 °C in a heating block to inactivate DNases.\n3. Amplifying the D1S80 VNTR locus using PCR\nNOTE: Record the number of samples that will be used and prepare a worksheet with the required reagents and their volumes before collecting the necessary plastics and other materials. Label the sterile tubes/strips/plates to be used for the PCR with sample numbers. Remember to include a negative control using H2O instead of DNA and a positive control (e.g., using the DNA provided by the instructor) to validate the PCR.\nPrepare the 1x PCR master mix containing 10 μL of 5x PCR reaction buffer (containing 15 mM MgCl2), 1 μL of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTPs) (10 mM), 5 μL (10 pmol) of each primer pMCT118-f and pMCT118-r (forward - 5'-GAAACTGGCCTCCAAACACTGCCCGCCG-3', reverse - 5'-GTCTTGTTGGAGATGCACGTGCCCCTTGC-3') according to Kasai et al.2, 23.8 μL of ultrapure H2O, and 0.2 μL of Taq DNA polymerase (5 U/µL).\n\tNOTE: The primers pMCT118-f/pMCT118-r were designed on the flanking regions of the D1S80 VNTR region amplifying the whole locus.\nLabel the PCR tubes/strips/plate with the sample numbers to be used.\nAliquot 45 μL of the master mix to each labeled PCR sample tube or well.\nAdd 5 μL of the DNA template to the master mix in each PCR tube/plate well to acquire a total volume of 50 µL. Change the pipette tip for every DNA sample to avoid cross contamination.\nInclude a no template control (NTC) by using ultrapure H2O instead of DNA.\nClose PCR tubes/strips or seal plate and mix.\nCentrifuge the PCR tubes/strips/plates for 20 s using a tabletop centrifuge.",
    "NOTE: PCR conditions given in this protocol were optimized using the DNA polymerase and the PCR thermal cycler used. In general, PCR conditions must be adapted to the DNA polymerase. The standard extension time for a Taq DNA polymerase is 1 min/kb.\nPlace the sample tubes/strips/plate in the thermocycler and incubate reactions using the following conditions (DNA polymerase extension time): 1 cycle of 95 °C for 2 min; 25 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 15 s, 72 °C for 30 s; 1 cycle of 72 °C for 10 min.\nWhen the program is complete, remove the products from the thermocycler and store at 4 °C overnight or -20 °C until electrophoresis.\n4. Agarose gel electrophoresis of PCR products\nPrepare a 1.5% agarose gel.\n\t\nUse 1.5 g of agarose powder and mix it with 100 mL of 1x Tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE) buffer solution in a flask.\nHeat the mixture for about 1.5-2 min in a microwave oven (600 W). Swirl the contents and heat again, if necessary, to completely dissolve the agarose. Cool slightly and add 2 μL of PeqGreen to the agarose.\nPour the gel in a form using a comb with enough wells for all samples and add at least one molecular weight marker.\n\t\tCAUTION: Boiling retardation may occur. Shake the flask carefully when resuspending the agarose which has not been dissolved yet.\n\t\tNOTE: PeqGreen is a non-toxic dye for the detection of nucleic acids. It is applicable for staining of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) as well as RNA. The sensitivity is comparable to ethidium bromide.\nRemove the PCR products from 4 °C and centrifuge for about 10 s.\nLoad the wells of the gel with 10 μL sample. Do not overload the gel.",
    "NOTE: The DNA polymerase buffer also includes compounds that increases sample density so that samples can be loaded directly onto gels without the need for a loading dye. This allows the sample to sink into the well and dyes help to track how far the DNA sample has migrated.\n\t\nAdd a molecular weight standard to the flanking wells (preferably a 50 bp molecular weight standard).\n\t\tNOTE: Store the residual PCR samples at -20 °C in case the agarose gel electrophoresis has to be repeated.\nRun the gel in 1x TAE running buffer at 150 V (constant) for approximately 40 min or until the lower yellow dye front that travels at around 50 bp reaches the lower end of the gel.\nImage the gel while blue light or ultraviolet (UV) light is applied and record an image for fragment length analysis.\n\tCAUTION: UV light can damage your eyes and skin. Always wear protective clothing and UV safety glasses when using a UV light box.\nDispose the gel in accordance with the institutional hazardous materials policy.\n5. Analysis of fragment length results\nNOTE: Use linear regression analysis to estimate the lengths of the fragments.\nFor sizing the D1S80 PCR fragments, place a ruler on the gel photograph over the 50 bp molecular weight standard lane such that the top of the ruler lines up with the bottom of the well into which the sample was loaded (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: To calculate the linear regression equation for the molecular weight standard (50 bp molecular weight standard) a spreadsheet program was used.\nRecord the distance from the well (e.g., in cm) for each band of the 50 bp molecular weight standard in a table using a spreadsheet program (Figure 2).",
    "Determine the log (e.g., base 10) of each fragment size of the 50 bp molecular weight standard and enter the log values into the table (Figure 2).\nPlot each data point to a graph with the log of the band sizes on the vertical axis (y-axis) and the measured run distance from the top of the gel to each band of the molecular weight standard on the horizontal axis (x-axis) using a scatterplot (Figure 3).\nFit a trendline (linear regression line) and show the regression equation (y = ax + b) and the R2 value on the graph (Figure 4).\nMeasure the distance migrated (e.g., in cm) for each D1S80 amplicon (Figure 5).\nEstimate the size of each D1S80 amplicon using the regression equation: y = ax + b\n\twhere y = the log of the fragment size\n\t           a = the slope of the line (calculated in point 5)\n\t           x = the distance from the well (in cm)\n\t           b = the point where the regression line intercepts the y-axis (calculated in point 5)\n\t​NOTE: Since the y-value represents the log of the fragment size, the antilog (10y) must be calculated to obtain the fragment size in bp of the D1S80 amplicons.\n6. Estimation of the number of repeat units in the alleles of the tested individuals\nNOTE: The D1S80 repeat unit is 16 bp in length. The smallest known allele for D1S80 has 14 repeats. The amplicon scheme described here produces amplicons with flanking regions adding up an extra 145 bp to the final size.\nUse Table 1 to estimate how many repeat units are contained in each PCR fragment. The size extrapolated using the linear regression should be within 8 bp of any particular allele.",
    "Record the genotype of each tested individual as a combination of allele repeat size numbers."
