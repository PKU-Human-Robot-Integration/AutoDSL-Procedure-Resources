    "1. Synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles\nCore synthesis – microwave-assisted\n\t\nDissolve 400 mg of iron(III) acetylacetonate (>99.9%) in 10 mL of benzyl alcohol (BA, 99.8%) within a 30 mL monowave glass vial.\nIncrease the temperature of the suspension from 25 to 250 °C in 20 min (at a rate of 11.25 °C/min) and maintain it at 250 °C for 30 min using a microwave reactor.\nTransfer the resulting nanoparticles suspended in benzyl alcohol to a glass vial and separate the nanoparticles using a neodymium magnet for 30 min.\nWash the precipitate in the previous 100 mL glass vial with 10 mL of dichloromethane, 1 M sodium hydroxide, ethanol, pH 7 water (three times) using a neodymium magnet for 5 min each step to pelletize nanoparticles and remove the supernatant.\nAdjust the nanoparticle suspension in water to pH 2 using 1 M hydrochloric acid, and then centrifuge in 100 kDa ultracentrifugal filters at 2,200 x g for 10 min.\nRemove the filtrate, add 12 mL of 10-2 M hydrochloric acid to the nanoparticles solution and centrifuge in 100 kDa ultracentrifugal filters at 2,200 x g for 10 min (three times). Then dilute the nanoparticles solution within 10 mL of 10-2 M hydrochloric acid before coating.\nCoating\n\t\nDilute 175 mg of citric acid and polyacrylic acid in water at pH 2 in a 100 mL glass vial and adjusted the pH to 2 with a 1 M hydrochloric acid solution.\nAdd the 10 mL nanoparticles aqueous dispersion to the coating molecule solution, corresponding to a mass ratio of 5 between the coating molecule and the nanoparticles. Agitate for 2 h under magnetic stirring at room temperature.\nAfter the reaction, adjust the pH to 7 with 1 M sodium hydroxide.",
    "Centrifuge the nanoparticle solution 3 times with deionized (DI) water in 100 kDa ultracentrifugal filters at 2,200 x g for 10 min; remove the filtrate and dilute the nanoparticles solution in 12 mL of DI water.\n2. Culture and magnetic labeling of stem cells\nCulture human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in complete Mesenchymal Stem Cell Growth Medium (MSCGM) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. When the cells are at 90% confluence, add 10 mL of trypsin-EDTA pre-warmed at 37°C per 150 cm² flask and leave for 2-3 minutes to detach the cells.\n\t\nTo know when the cells are detached, observe them with a bright-field microscope. Resuspend the detached cells in MSCGM and divide them in four 150 cm² flasks. Amplify the cells this way until passage 4 to 5.\nPrepare the solution of magnetic nanoparticles for cell labeling: disperse the chosen concentration of iron oxide nanoparticles in serum free Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RMPI-1640) without glutamine. RPMI is used for nanoparticle incubation (and the related rinsing steps) as it has a lower ionic strength than DMEM and better prevents nanoparticle aggregation events.\nWhen the cells are at passage 4 or 5 and 90% confluent, remove the MSCGM medium, rinse the cells with serum free RPMI (without glutamine) and add 10 mL of iron oxide nanoparticles solution per 150 cm2 culture flask, which is the minimum volume required to cover all the cells.\nIncubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 30 min and then discard the nanoparticle solution. Wash once with serum free RPMI-1640 (no glutamine) and incubate with Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (25 mL per 150 cm2 flask) overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2 to allow a complete internalization of the nanoparticles.\n3. Formation of stem cell-spheroids",
    "Freshly prepare cell-spheroid culture medium composed of DMEM high glucose with L-glutamine supplemented with 50 µM L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate, 0.1 µM dexamethasone, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.35 mM L-proline, and 1% universal culture supplement containing Insulin, human Transferrin and Selenous acid (ITS-Premix).\nDetach the magnetic MSCs by adding 10 mL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA pre-warmed at 37 °C per 150 cm2 flask for 2-3 minutes. When the cells are detached, immediately inactivate the trypsin by adding 1/3 of the volume of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin pre-warmed at 37 °C.\nCentrifuge the dissociated cells at 260 x g for 5 min, aspirate the media and re-suspend the cells in a small volume (less than 1 mL per 150 cm² flask) of cell-spheroid culture medium such as having 200,000 cells in about 50 µL of medium. Count the cell number using a hemocytometer and adjust the volume if needed.\nAdd 1 mL of freshly prepared cell-spheroid culture medium in a 15 mL sterile conical centrifuge tube and add the volume of resuspended solution corresponding to 200,000 cells.\nCentrifuge these magnetically labeled cells at 180 x g for 3 min such as forming a cell pellet at the bottom of the tube and keep the supernatant, which is the cell culture medium.\nSlightly open the tubes to allow air exchange and incubate at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for up to 21 days, culture time along which the cells form a cohesive 3D structure that results in a fully formed spheroid. Change the medium twice a week.",
    "On given days, wash the spheroids twice with cacodylate buffer made of 0.2 M cacodylate diluted in demineralized water and fix them using 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer diluted in distilled water for 30 min at room temperature. Store the fixed spheroids in PBS until used for VSM measurement or TEM imaging. This fixation step stops all biological processes and allows long-term conservation.\n4. Quantification of magnetic nanoparticles in solution and in cellulo using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM)\nPlace either a given volume of magnetic nanoparticle solution (maximum 10 µL) or a single cell-spheroid into the sample holder specifically designed to fit in the VSM.\nInsert the sample in the VSM and scan for sample offset. Place the sample at the position corresponding to the magnetization maximum.\nPerform the first measurement at a low magnetic field (between -1500 Oe and +1500 Oe) with a 20 Oe/s rate.\nPerform a second measurement at a high magnetic field (between -30 000 Oe and +30 000 Oe) with a 200 Oe/s rate.\n5. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis\nFor the nanoparticle solutions, deposit 10 μL of the aqueous solution onto a carbon-coated copper grid and let it dry at room temperature.\nFor the nanoparticles internalized in cells, contrast the fixed cell-spheroids with Oolong Tea Extract (OTE) at 0.5% diluted in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, post fix with 1% osmium tetroxide containing 1.5% potassium cyanoferrate and then dehydrate in graded ethanol baths, included in Epon. Slice ultrasections of 70 nm and deposit them onto cooper grids.\nTake images using an electron microscope at 80 kV with a magnification from 1k for the observation of entire cells to 40k for the observation of endosomal compartments.\nSubscription Required.
