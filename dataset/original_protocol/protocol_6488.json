    "Note: Histone purification and H2A-H2B complex assembly protocol is adapted from a previously published protocol (Luger et al., 1997b and 1999). The protocol has been altered slightly to suit the requirements of the current experiment. This protocol describes a methodology for analysis of Imp9–H2A-H2B complexes and can be used to study not only other Importin–histone complexes but also various histone chaperone complexes. A flow chart of the protocol is shown in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200514/20200514031818_5269.jpgFigure 1. Flow chart depicting various steps of protein purification and analytical ultracentrifugation Expression of histones H2A/H2BTransform E. coli BL21 DE3 plysS cells with histone expression plasmid (pET-3a containing H2A/H2B gene) and plate on 2x YPT agar plates containing appropriate antibiotics (ampicillin and chloramphenicol). Incubate at 37 °C overnight (12-15 h). Fresh transformation will ensure better protein expression.Pick single colonies and start 3-5 ml pre-culture in 2x YPT media with appropriate antibiotic. Grow them at 37 °C overnight.Inoculate 100 ml 2x YPT media with antibiotics with 100 µl turbid pre-cultures and incubate until the OD reaches 0.4-0.5.Inoculate six 1 L 2x YPT media containing antibiotics evenly with the culture from Step A3 and grow at 37 °C until the OD reaches 0.4-0.5 and induce with 250 μM IPTG for 4 h at 37 °C.After 4 h, harvest the cells by centrifugation at 4,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C.Resuspend the cell pellets in 35 ml/L (cell culture) of wash buffer.Flash freeze the cell suspension in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C. The frozen cell suspension can be stored for a week at -80 °C.Histone purification from inclusion bodiesThaw the cell suspension at room temperature (25 °C) and place the tube containing the cell suspension in an ice-beaker with the sonicator probe in the tube.",
    "Set up the sonicator on pulse mode (1 s on and 1 s off). Lyse the cells on pulse mode at 50% amplitude for 3 min, repeating it 3-4 times or until the cell suspension becomes less viscous. The pulse mode and ice-beaker help prevent over-heating of the sample.Transfer the lysate into Oakridge tubes and spin at 25,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 35 ml/L (cell culture) of wash buffer containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100.Spin at 25,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C. Discard the wash buffer.Repeat the wash described above twice with wash buffer without Triton X-100. Discard the wash buffer after the spin (25,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C). Collect the final pellet. The pellet contains the protein (H2A/H2B) inclusion bodies.The inclusion body pellet can be stored at -20 °C for a week.Thaw the inclusion body pellet at room temperature first by dissolving the pellet in 1ml of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and then suspending it well in 20 ml of unfolding buffer. Incubate it on a rocker gently (10-15 rpm) at room temperature for 30 min.Spin the suspension at 25,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove any particulates.Transfer the supernatant from the previous step carefully to the dialysis tubing (6-8 kDa cutoff).Dialyze the sample overnight in SAU-200 (4 x 1 L), changing the buffer every hour for the first three rounds and leaving the last one overnight. All dialysis steps are carried out at 4 °C.Carefully transfer the dialyzed sample to Oakridge tubes and spin at 25,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove any particulates.Connect HiTrap SP HP (Cation exchange chromatography) column to the FPLC system (AKTA pure) and equilibrate with SAU-200.",

Pool the peak fractions from HiTrap SP HP column and transfer carefully to a dialysis tubing (6-8 kDa cutoff) and dialyze in ice-cold water (Water + 5 mM β-mercapto-ethanol) overnight (4 × 4 L), changing the water every hour for the first three rounds and leaving the last one overnight.Determine the concentration of histones in the dialyzed sample by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm against water using a NanoDrop and applying the known extinction coefficient and path length in Beer’s Law and aliquot the dialyzed samples into cryovials at approximately 1 mg total protein per aliquot. The theoretical molar extinction coefficients can be obtained using expasy protoparam tool (http://ca.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html[href=http://ca.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html]).Prepare an icebox with dry ice and fill it with ice-cold ethanol.Transfer the cryovials from Step B16 into the icebox to flash freeze.Remove the cap of the cryovials and seal with parafilm and puncture the parafilm.Turn on the Lyophilizer and close the ballast. Wait for the vacuum to reach < 100 mT and condenser temperature to -40 °C.Load samples into the Lyophilizer bottles. Open the vacuum valve and let it run overnight.After the run, turn off the vacuum and take out the samples.",

Gently mix it once and incubate at 4 °C. Do not rock the column after addition of TEV protease.Elute Imp9 from the column. GST tag stays bound to the resin.Connect HiTrap Q HP (Anion exchange chromatography) column to the FPLC system (AKTA pure) and equilibrate with 100 mM sodium chloride Q buffer. Set up an FPLC program to inject the sample and run a linear gradient from 100% 100 mM sodium chloride Q-buffer to 100% 1 M sodium chloride Q-buffer in 20 column volumes. 150 ml of each buffer should be enough to form the linear gradient in a 5 ml HiTrap Q HP column.Inject Imp9 from Step E11 to HiTrap Q HP column pre-equilibrated with 100 mM sodium chloride Q buffer.Elute the protein from the column using the set linear gradient of 100% 100 mM sodium chloride Q-buffer to 100% 1 M sodium chloride Q-buffer (Imp9 elutes at approximately 22% B [78% A and 22% B]. The peak is quite distinct and the fractions within the peak are pooled).Pool the fractions containing Imp9 and concentrate the protein using 50 kDa Amicon centrifugal concentrator to an appropriate injection volume (A maximum load of 0.5 ml of 10 mg total protein is recommended per injection for good resolution on the S200 Superdex increase column).Inject the protein from Step E15 to an S200 Superdex increase column pre-equilibrated with Size-exclusion buffer (Imp9-SEC buffer).
