    "1. gRNA Design\nSelect a standard gRNA design tool to design the guide RNAs10. Use complementary pairs of the previously developed CLOuD9 constructs9 (i.e., at least 1 S. aureus (CSA) and 1 S. pyogenes (CSP) construct) for each experiment.\n\t\nWithin the selected online design tool, use the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) sequence \"NGG\" with a guide length of 20 bp for CSP and the PAM sequence \"NNGRRT\" with a guide length of 21 for CSA.\nChoose guides based on specificity score and design guides on both strands to maximize chances of obtaining a working guide.\nOrder 2 oligonucleotides per guide from an oligo manufacturer: for the forward oligo, add \"caccg\" to the 5' end of the guide sequence, and for the reverse oligo, add \"aaac\" to the 5' end and \"c\" to the 3' end before ordering.\nInitially, design 3-5 gRNAs for each region of interest, spread over a 250-1000 bp region. Assess the gRNA targeting efficiency as follows:\n\t\nClone identified gRNAs into an active Cas9 plasmid (see step 3) and transiently transfect into 293T cells (see step 4)11.\nGrow cells for 2-3 d in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (pen strep), then harvest and extract genomic DNA12.\nAmplify targeted regions by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Run products on a 1.5% agarose gel and purify appropriate bands.\nPerform a T7 endonuclease assay as described in the Guschin, et al. protocol13,14.\n\t\tNOTE: Efficient guides are those determined to cut DNA at the target site.\n2. Cell Culture\nMaintain cells in a healthy and actively dividing state.\n\t\nFor K562s, culture in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 media with 10% FBS and 1% pen strep.",
    "Grow K562s in a 25 cm2 canted neck flask for maintenance and adjust the cell density to 400,000 cells per mL each day.\nAfter K562s have been transduced with CLOuD9 constructs, add 2 µg/mL puromycin and 100 µg/mL hygromycin to maintenance media.\nFor 293Ts, culture in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% FBS and 1% pen strep.\n\t\t\nGrow 293Ts in 10 cm2 plates and split when confluent.\n3. Plasmid Preparation and gRNA Insertion15\nNote: Plasmid maps are available in the appendix and primers utilized in the example experiments are available in Supplementary Table 1.\nMix 5 µg of the lentiviral CRISPR plasmid with 3 µL of BsmBI, 3 µL of Alkaline Phosphatase, 6 µL of 10x Buffer, and 0.6 µL of freshly prepared 100 mM DTT. Bring the total volume to 60 µL with ddH2O and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min to digest and dephosphorylate the plasmid.\nGel purify the digested plasmid and elute in ddH2O.\nMix 1 µL of each of the paired guides at 100 µM with 1 µL of 10x T4 Ligation Buffer, 6.5 µL of ddH2O, and 0.5 µL T4 PNK, to reach 10 µL total volume. Incubate at 37 °C for 30 min, then 95 °C for 5 min, then ramp down to 25 °C at 5 °C/min.\n\tNote: This will anneal the pair of guides.\nDilute the annealed guides (from step 3.3) 1:200 in ddH2O.\nMix 1 µL of the digested plasmid from step 3.2 with 0.5 µL of the diluted ligated guides from step 3.4, 2.5 µL of 2x Buffer, 1 µl of ddH2O, and 0.5 µL of Ligase, to make a 5.5 µL total reaction. Incubate this at room temperature for 10 min to ligate the guides to the BsmBI digested plasmid.",
    "Transform the newly ligated plasmid from step 3.5 into Stbl3 bacteria and amplify using any plasmid preparation method.\n4. Lentivirus Production\nCount 750,000 293T cells per well for a six-well plate using a hemocytometer and seed them in DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% pen strep. Use one well for each construct.\n24 h after seeding, change media to fresh antibiotic-free DMEM with 10% FBS.\nIn one tube, dilute 11 µL of lipid-based transfection reagent with 150 µL of the OptiMEM medium, per reaction11.\nIn a separate tube, dilute 2 µg of the CLOuD9 lentiviral vector plasmid from step 3.6, 0.35 µg of pMDLg/pRRE, 1 µg of pRSV-Rev, and 0.65 µg of pMD2.G with 150 µL of the OptiMEM medium, per reaction11.\nFor each reaction, add the diluted lentiviral plasmid mixtures to the diluted lipid-based transfection reagent at a 1:1 ratio, and incubate for 5 min11.\nAdd the entire volume of each mixed complex from step 4.5 into the respective wells of the antibiotic-free 293T cells from step 4.2.\n48 h later, collect viral production media by pipetting into a fresh tube and spin down at 300 x g for 5 min. After centrifugation, move the supernatant to a fresh tube to remove residual cell debris.\nUse viral production media immediately for the transduction of target cells or freeze at -80 °C for future use.\n5. Lentivirus Transduction of Cells\nAdd 250 µL of each viral construct of interest (comprised of complementary CLOuD9 plasmids) to a 15 mL conical tube containing 80,000 cells for the CLOuD9 application.\nBring the total volume of media in each conical to 1 mL with antibiotic-free media, and add polybrene to a final concentration of between 1-8 µg/mL (the maximum concentration of polybrene tolerated by the cell type utilized will need to be determined experimentally).",
    "Spin cells at 800 x g for 30 min at room temperature, then resuspend by pipetting without removing the viral supernatant. Move the entire cell suspension to a cell culture plate.\n24 h post-transduction, spin cells down at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nAspirate viral supernatant and resuspend cells in regular cell culture media.\nOn the next day, add puromycin (1 µg/mL for 293T cells) and hygromycin (25 µg/mL for 293T cells) to the cell culture medium to select for doubly transduced cells. Experimentally determine the appropriate concentrations of puromycin and hygromycin for a given cell type prior to beginning the experiments.\nKeep cells in selection media for at least 3 d before any downstream experiments and maintain in selection media for the duration of all experiments.\n6. Cell Dimerization and Wash Out\nAdd 1 mM Abscisic Acid (ABA) or an equivalent volume of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for controls to cell culture to dimerize the CLOuD9 selected and transduced cells. Use ABA within 6 months of date of receipt, keep cold, and protect it from light throughout use. 2 mM ABA can be utilized if needed.\n\t\nChange media daily to provide fresh ABA (or DMSO for controls) for the duration of the experiments.\n\t\tNOTE: No limit on the length of dimerization has yet been observed.\nReverse dimerization through the removal of media containing ABA and washing cells with enough phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to cover the surface of the plate, twice. Thereafter, culture cells in ABA-free media to maintain an un-dimerized state.\n7. Immunoprecipitation and Co-immunoprecipitations\nNOTE: Make all buffers fresh and immediately prior to use.\nFollowing completion of dimerization experiments, collect and spin down cells, then aspirate supernatant.\nCrosslink and freeze down cells",
    "Make a fresh stock of 1% formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature using fresh materials. For every 2 million cells, gently resuspend with 1 mL of 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for exactly 10 min, while rotating.\n\t\tNOTE: Use a minimum volume of 10 mL for crosslinking less than 10 million cells.\nQuench crosslinking with the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 M, followed by incubation for 5 min at room temperature, while rotating.\nSpin down cells and wash 1-2x with ice-cold PBS. Cell pellets can then be snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C or used immediately.\n\t\tNOTE: Heat will reverse formaldehyde crosslinks. If rushed, cells can be stored directly in -80 °C without the snap freeze.\nPrepare antibody/bead conjugate\n\tNote: Optimizing conditions for chosen antibody (i.e, testing different lysis buffers for cell lysis and performing IP) may be worthwhile. Two common buffers, Farnham lysis buffer and Modified RIPA buffer, can have a significant effect on the IP efficiency and sonication efficiency. All buffer compositions can be found in the Table of Materials. Additionally, keep in mind that chromatin sonication may take several hours to complete.\n\t\nResuspend beads by vortexing briefly as appropriate for the chosen antibody.\nTransfer an appropriate amount of beads for the experiment to a 1.5 mL tube. As a starting point, use 20 µL of beads for every 1 µg of antibody. Do not add antibody yet.\n\t\tNOTE: Use 10 µg antibody with 200 µL of beads for 1 mg of total lysate as a starting point, unless it is known that the antibody is more or less efficient than this would imply. For low abundance proteins, this ratio may need to be adjusted.",
    "If using Farnham lysis buffer, wash 3x in IP dilution buffer. If using RIPA lysis buffer, wash 3x in RIPA lysis buffer.\nResuspend beads in a final volume of the same buffer from step 7.3.3 (either IP dilution or RIPA buffer) that is >1x and <5x the initial volume. i.e. For 100 µL initial bead volume, use between 100 and 500 µL final resuspension volume.\nAdd antibody to washed beads now at an appropriate concentration. For a good HA or Flag antibody to IP CLOuD9 constructs, use antibodies at 1:50 (µg protein: µg protein lysate) and incubate between 8+ h and overnight at 4 °C, while rotating. Alternatively, incubate for 2-4 h at room temperature.\nRemove the supernatant from beads and discard.\nWash beads 3x with the Wash buffer.\nResuspend in a minimal volume of the buffer utilized for overnight incubation with the antibody (IP dilution or RIPA buffer). Keep cold until combined with protein lysate.\nSonicate Chromatin\n\t\nFirst lyse cells with the addition of Swelling buffer to cell pellets on ice for 10 min, flicking cells every few min to prevent settling.\n\t\tNOTE: Generally, 500 µL of Swelling buffer is added to 25 million cells and scaled from there, but do not use less than 500 µL buffer for <25 million cells.\nDounce manually both clockwise and counterclockwise, 13x each.\nThen spin nuclei down at 4 °C for 5 min at 1,500 x g. Aspirate the supernatant completely and repeat to remove remaining supernatant, then weigh the cell pellet in mg.\nAdd protease inhibitor to nuclei lysis buffer (Farnham buffer or RIPA buffer, above, choose one).",
    "Add 10x amount of nuclei lysis buffer to pelleted nuclei to resuspend (for example, add 1 mL of nuclei lysis buffer to a 0.100 g pellet). Briefly vortex and lyse for 10 min on ice.\n\t\tNOTE: Keep in mind the size of the sonication tube. Ideal volume is often <1 mL, so samples may need to be divided if pellets are very large.\n\t\t\nFor Co-IP, sonicate nuclei briefly to solubilize material and quench SDS to a level that permits immunoprecipitation with 2-3 volumes of dilution buffer, then proceed to step 7.4.6. For very sensitive antibodies, add more dilution buffer to further reduce the concentration of SDS.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Stop sonication when lysate clears; it will change from an opaque/translucent white to completely transparent. Keep samples as cold as possible and do not over sonicate.\nFor ChIP, thoroughly sonicate DNA to obtain 150-1000 bp DNA fragments, then proceed to step 7.4.6.\nSpin out insoluble material at maximum speed for 10 min at 4 °C.\nTransfer soluble material to a fresh tube.\nFor Co-IP, measure the concentration of protein and proceed to the pulldown in step 7.5.\nFor ChIP, remove a 10 µL aliquot of cleared lysate and add 40 µL IP elution buffer and 6 µL 5 M NaCl to that for a total of 56ul. Boil for 15 min at 95 °C, add 5-10 µL of 3 M NaOAc pH 5, and clean up on a PCR purification column. Measure the concentration of DNA by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm and standardize across samples. Then proceed to pulldown in step 7.5.\n\t\tNOTE: Extra lysate can be snap frozen at -80 °C and used at a later time, but best results are obtained from the fresh lysate. If freezing, do not freeze/thaw lysate more than once.\nPulldown",
    "Transfer an appropriate amount of protein lysate to a fresh tube. If using Farnham lysis buffer, dilute in 2.1 volumes of IP dilution buffer (above).\nSet aside 100 µL of supernatant for input control, and store at 4 °C until the next day.\nAdd bead/antibody conjugate from step 7.3.8 to samples now.\nRotate samples at 4 °C overnight and ensure there is enough volume for liquid movement in 1.5 mL tubes.\nWash and Elute\n\t\nAfter overnight rotation, save the supernatant as the nonbinding fraction. Then wash beads 3-5x in IP dilution buffer.\nPrepare IP elution buffer at room temperature, without inhibitors.\nElute complexes with 50 µL elution buffer shaken on a vortex at 67 °C for 15 min. Transfer elution to a new tube and repeat with another 50 µL. Combine them both for a total 100 µL elution.\n\t\tNOTE: If there is too much background from this elution procedure, heat can be reduced or eliminated during shaking/incubation. This generally reduces the yield of target protein but does significantly decrease the background.\nReverse crosslinks by heating at 67 °C for >4 h.\n\tNOTE: This is not strictly necessary for Co-IPs but can be helpful.\n\t\nFor Co-IP, to ensure full dimerization between the targets of interest, run eluates on an SDS-page gel and probe with antibodies against the HA tag or Flag tag, as indicated, all at 1: 1,000. Then continue to step 8.\nFor ChIP-qPCR, to ensure correct localization and targeting of each CRISPR-dCas9 component, clean elution product on a column and elute in 10 µL. Perform real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of purified DNA. Primers utilized in the presented data are available in Supplementary Table 1. Then continue to step 8.\n8. RNA Extraction and Quantitative PCR",
    "To investigate the CLOuD9-induced changes in gene expression, first, isolate and purify total RNA from both control cell pellets and dimerized cell pellets.\nMake complementary DNA (cDNA) from the purified RNA by reverse transcription17 and perform qPCR analyses. Primers are available in Supplementary Table 1.\n9. Chromosome Conformation Capture Assay\nTo observe changes in the frequency of genomic loci contacts induced by CLOuD9, perform chromosome conformation capture (3C) assays8.\nQuantify 3C ligation products in two sets of duplicates for each of three biological replicates by quantitative real-time PCR. Normalize samples to the 3C signals from the tubulin locus. Primers are available in Supplementary Table 1."
