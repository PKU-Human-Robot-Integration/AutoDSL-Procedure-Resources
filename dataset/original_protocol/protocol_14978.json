    "Eligible participants sign written, informed consent to participate in the research project. Research is performed in compliance with institutional, national and international guidelines for human welfare.\n1. Participant Screening and Diagnostic Interviews\nAfter informed consent, perform diagnostic interviews to verify the diagnosis of PTSD and illness severity. NOTE: These measures include the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (SCID)24  and the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS)25, as well as the Folstein Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE)26 to evaluate cognitive status.\nAsk participants to fill out self-report scales relevant to stress and mood.\n\tNOTE: These include the Life Stressor Checklist–Revised (LSC-R)27, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ)28, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)29 and Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-SR)30.\nSchedule eligible participants for MRI, where participants arrive approximately 1 hr before the scheduled scan session, to review components needed for scanning, such as MRI safety and study procedures.\nObtain urine, pregnancy (when appropriate), and toxicology tests prior to scanning.\n2. Training Participants to Perform the N-back Task\nBegin the first run with the 0-back letter vigilance test.\n\t\nInstruct participants to indicate “Yes” to a target consonant (“h” or “H”) via a two-button response box and “No” to all other consonants.\nShow the participant 9 consonants for 500 msec each, with an interstimulus time of 2,500 ms, for a total of 27 sec, and ask them to respond as directed above. NOTE: The target consonant will be shown 4 times within each 0-back block.\nNext, have participants practice the 2-back test.\n\t\nInstruct participants to make a “Yes” or “No” response on the two-button response box, after each consonant presented, to indicate whether it is the same or different from the consonant presented two previously in a series.",
    "Show the participant a series of 15 consonants, for 500 msec each, with an interstimulus interval of 2,500 msec, for a total of 45 sec. NOTE: A target stimulus is shown 5 times.\nTrain participants to perform the n-back task outside the scanner, until their performance reaches >75% correct on the 2-back component. NOTE: The above parameters can be automated using stimulus presentation software (see Table of Materials/Equipment).\n3. MRI Acquisition\nHave the participant change into MRI-compatible clothing, and bring them inside a 3 Tesla MRI scanner room. Have them wear earplugs for hearing protection, and then lie down in a gurney that will ultimately move them into the middle of the MRI machine.\n\t\nPlace cushions around their head to minimize head motion. Provide them with the MRI-compatible response box for the n-back working memory task, squeeze bulb to stop the scan in case of an emergency, and place a pulse oximeter on their finger for physiologic monitoring and recording.\nPlace the 32-channel head coil and presentation screen over the participant’s head, and move them into the middle of the scanner.\nEnsure the participant is comfortable and can see the screen, and then begin the MRI scan session. Start with acquisition of high-resolution (1 mm3) anatomic brain scans. Enter high resolution MRI parameters on the scanner console at Echo Time (TE) = 2.98 msec, Repetition Time (TR) = 1,900 msec, Field of View (FOV) = 256 mm2 and matrix size 642 in 1 mm slices. Start the MRI acquisition by pressing the “run” button on the scanner console.\nSet FMRI BOLD image acquisition parameters on the scanner console as TR = 2,500 msec, TE = 28 msec, FOV = 192 mm2, and matrix size 642 in 3 mm axial slices.",
    "Next, acquire FMRI images on working memory, using the n-back test (see section 2) with the following parameters:\n\t\nPresent a 30 sec baseline fixation cross, to the patient, prior to each of the 0-back blocks using stimulus presentation software. NOTE: This will provide a baseline for comparison for the other 0- and 2-back blocks during data analysis.\nProject the instructions to the patient for 3 sec prior to each 0 or 2-back task using the stimulus presentation software.\nIn total, include three 0-back and 2-back portions along with two baseline blocks, in two imaging runs, presented in counter-balanced order.\nPress “run” on the MRI scanner console to start.\nAfter completion of the n-back, ensure the participant is comfortable and ready to move on. Instruct them that the rest block is next, and tell them not to fall asleep. Use stimulus presentation software to display a fixation cross on the screen.\nAcquire resting state images for the next 4 min, using the same FMRI settings as were used to acquire n-back images (see 3.3), by pressing “run” on the MRI scanner console.\nRepeat steps 3.4. and 3.5. Prior to each new section, ask the participant if they are comfortable and if they are able to continue. If they are able, continue the protocol. If they are not, pause the MRI scanner and make adjustments for comfort as needed.\nNext, tell the participant that the scanner may be shaking during the next sequences, and instruct them to close their eyes and relax as best they can in the scanner. Then acquire a DTI sequence by pressing the “run” button on the scanner console.",
    "Set DTI image acquisition parameters in the scanner console to double spin echo-planar diffusion weighted images (DWI), with diffusion gradients applied in 64 non-collinear directions (b = 1,000), one DWI for each gradient direction and 10 non-weighted (b = 0) normalization images, TR = 10,060 msec, TE = 103 msec, FOV = 226 mm, 1282 matrix, slice thickness = 1.8 mm, with partial echoes and interpolation on.\nRemove the participant from the scanner, and inquire about how the session went. Answer any questions they may have, and thank them for their participation. Have the MRI scanner computer write a DVD with participant images and physiologic recording for subsequent data analyses.\n4. Data Analysis\nData Preprocessing\n\t\nUsing FMRI processing software, reconstruct raw data into 3D + time datasets, concatenate and register to the fifth volume of the first series, to minimize movement artifact and yield motion correction parameters. Apply bandpass filtering (0.009-0.08 Hz) to isolate the DMN frequency domain and reduce effects of low frequency drift and high frequency noise. NOTE: Nuisance variables for each voxel should include average ventricle and white matter time series as well as 6 parameter estimates of head motion; these estimates should include both demeaned and derivative values. The predicted time course of nuisance variables should be removed from the full voxel time series to yield a “residual” time series data to be used for later correlation analyses31.\nScale data to normalize within-run intensity, and smooth data up to a 4 mm full width half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. Censor images with greater than 1.5 mm displacement from the dataset32. Do not perform global signal regression (GSR) since GSR can influence correlations in resting state data33,34.\nResting State Connectivity Analyses",
    "Use seed-region connectivity analyses to evaluate the relationship between a priori defined regions to evaluate functional connectivity11. NOTE: Seeds included are the major anterior and posterior nodes of the DMN, the MPFC and PCC, respectively. Functional coordinates of these locations are generally superior to atlas-defined locations35.\nExtract the average BOLD time series from these seeds and conduct a whole-brain correlation analysis. Transform correlational R values to Z scores36 for subsequent hypothesis testing.\n\t\t\nCompare Z values between groups on a voxel by voxel basis to evaluate significant differences in functional connectivity between PTSD and controls as the primary outcome measure. Threshold these results at a two-tailed significance at p < 0.05, using family-wise (i.e. cluster) error correction. NOTE: Cluster correction is generated using Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the probability of false positive clusters. Use statistical algorithms to calculate cluster correction as a function of FOV, resolution, smoothness, and signal intensity at the individual voxel level37.\nTo evaluate the relationship between clinical symptoms and imaging results, conduct follow-up analyses that include correlations between rating scale scores and average Z scores of connectivity of DMN regions. Include correlation analyses that account for relevant demographic information, such as depression severity, traumatic brain injury, as well as education and other associated variables.\nWorking Memory Analyses\n\t\nUse FMRI processing software to pre-process the data and voxel-based GLM to quantify task-specific activity in each brain voxel of individual datasets11,31. NOTE: Independent variables in the GLM are the temporal course of rest and the 0- and 2-back tasks (including hemodynamic transitions modeled as a gamma function) and covariates (linear drift and observed movement), with the BOLD signal over time as the dependent variable.",
    "Average resulting GLM beta weights across specified DMN regions. NOTE: These averaged n-back responses from individual-level datasets serve as the basic measure of brain activity in subsequent group-level statistical analyses.\nUse analyses of covariance to examine group-level differences between PTSD and non-PTSD groups and to estimate effects of task difficulty (i.e. comparisons of activity during 0- vs. 2-back tasks) in each DMN region; Also include analyses of any relevant statistical control steps as required during resting state analyses in 4.2.\nStructural Connectivity Using DTI\n\t\nPreprocessing\n\t\t\nUsing DTI processing software, co-register non-diffusion (i.e. b = o) images to correct for motion artifacts, and use as a normalization image for subsequent diffusion-weighted images. Use a 12 parameter affine transformation to register the diffusion-weighted images to account for motion and eddy current artifacts.\nEnsure that the gradient vector for each diffusion direction is rotated to account for transformations prior to model fitting. Calculate a second-order diffusion tensor per voxel from the diffusion weighted signal attenuations using a nonlinear constrained fitting procedure38.\nUse the diffusion-weighted images to calculate eigenvalue, eigenvector and fractional anisotropy maps of diffusion.\nUse tractography software to quantify the integrity of the of the cingulum bundle. Utilize standard atlases for seed region selection, such as those by Mori et al.39 and Catani and De Schotten40. Filter resultant tractography through a midline exclusion region to remove fibers crossing between hemispheres. Calculate mean FA, trace, axial and radial diffusivity for all voxels through which the cingulum bundle passes.\nUse mixed model ANOVA for each diffusion measure, with hemisphere as a within-subject variable, to compare group differences between PTSD and non-PTSD participants, statistically controlling for other factors, such as depression severity, substance abuse, mild TBI and education and demographic variables using ANCOVA.\nSubscription Required.
