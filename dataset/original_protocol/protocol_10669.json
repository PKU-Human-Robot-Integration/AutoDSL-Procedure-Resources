  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: Microwell plates are available in different formats, depending on the desired results. Specifications as well as approximate guidelines for the minimum and maximum numbers of cells that should be used with each format are shown in Table 1. The smaller microwells taper to a sharp point, and thus there is no lower size limit, although variability between spheroids becomes more significant at smaller sizes. Routine production of spheroids from an average of as little as 20 cells each is straightforward8. The larger microwell size is not fully tapered, therefore attempts to form spheroids from small numbers of cells may result in multiple smaller spheroids in each microwell. Due to slight differences in surface properties, preparation with the surfactant solution (step 1.2) is not optional when using AggreWell 400Ex plates.\nThis protocol is based on the use of AggreWell 400 plates - for other formats consult Table 1. The number of cells to be loaded in each well is determined by multiplying the number of microwells it contains by the number of cells to be clustered for each spheroid. For example, to generate spheroids from 1000 cells apiece, each well must be loaded with (1,200 spheroids times 1,000 cells each = ) 1.2 x 106 cells. Cell density must be calculated given that the cells will be loaded in a volume of 0.4 ml. So for the example of spheroids formed from 1000 cells each, 1.2 x 106 cells in 0.4 ml translates to a density of 3 x 106 cells per ml.\n1. Preparing Microwells to Receive Cells",
    "Microwell plates are sterile as provided, and should only be removed from their packaging in a sterile environment such as a laminar-flow biosafety cabinet. Sterility should be maintained throughout the protocol. Should sterility be compromised, the wells are resterilized using 70% ethanol in water using the following optional steps.\n\t\nAdd 0.5 ml of 70% ethanol to each unused well. Some microwells will trap air bubbles, although this can be reduced by adding liquid at one side, and allowing it to spread across the surface, rather than dropping it vertically onto the surface. Replace lid.\nWhile ethanol vapor should quickly permeate any bubbles, if there are large numbers it may be desirable to remove them. Centrifuge for 2 min at 2,000 x g. Note that it is important to ensure the rotor is properly balanced at this speed.\nUsing a low-magnification inverted microscope, verify bubbles have been removed from the microwells.\nIncubate for 5 min with the lid on at room temperature.\nAspirate ethanol. Plate can now be washed with sterile water or PBS for immediate use, or air-dried for storage.\nIn order to ensure that cells do not interact with the microwell surface, it may be prepared using a surfactant. In general it is advisable to perform this step initially, and subsequently compare spheroids generated with and without surfactant-coated microwells.\n\t\nAdd 0.5 ml of Rinsing Solution to each well. Some microwells will trap air bubbles, although this can be reduced by adding liquid at one side, and allowing it to spread across the surface, rather than dropping it vertically onto the surface. Replace lid.\nCentrifuge for 2 min at 2,000 x g to remove bubbles. Note that it is important to ensure the rotor is properly balanced at this speed.",
    "Using a low-magnification inverted microscope, verify bubbles have been removed from the microwells.\nIncubate for at least thirty minutes with the lid on at room temperature, or overnight at 4 °C. Plates may be stored at four degrees with the surfactant solution in the wells until needed if properly sealed to prevent drying out.\nWash plate with sterile water or PBS immediately prior to use. Do not allow plates to dry out after coating.\n2. Preparing Cells\nNOTE: The details of cell preparation will vary somewhat with the specific cell type being studied. However we have observed these conditions to be effective with a broad range of cells, including the lines discussed here, as well as human and murine embryonic stem cells (ESC), human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), fibroblasts, putative primitive endoderm, and stromal cells. Other groups have employed this system successfully for a wide range of applications including chondrogenesis from mesenchymal stem cells9, standardized generation of neural precursors from pluripotent stem cells10, toxicological analyses in hepatocytes11 and assessment of spinal cord regeneration in salamanders12. The specific protocol for working with HT29 cells is shown here.\nStart with a T75 flask of HT29 cells, cultured in DMEM + 10% FBS\nAspirate growth medium from flask, and add 3 ml of trypsin.\nIncubate cells for 5 min at 37 °C.\nStop trypsin digestion by adding 3 ml of growth medium. Take an aliquot for cell counting and transfer the remainder into a 15 ml centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 200 x g.\nWhile the centrifugation is in progress, count cells.\nAspirate trypsin/medium mixture and replace with fresh growth medium, volume determined by the required cell density as calculated above.",
    "(OPTIONAL) Pass the cell suspension through a strainer in order to remove any clumps. NOTE: Cell harvesting conditions will vary somewhat between lines. If a dissociation protocol for e.g. passaging the cells of interest is available, that should be used as a starting point. With sensitive cell lines use of trypsin may result in excessive cell death. In these cases we have observed good results using TrypLE as an alternative dissociation reagent8. If the cells become clumped during dissociation and lose viability, addition of DNAse to the enzyme solution may resolve this. Reducing dissociation times and employing a trituration step to break up cell clumps can also increase viability.\n3. Spheroid Formation\nNOTE: Spheroids may be generated in a variety of medium formulations, however initial trials should be carried out using the medium in which the cells were cultured, to distinguish consequences of transitioning to a 3-dimensional culture system from consequences of changing medium composition.\nAdd 0.4 ml of growth medium to each well.\nCentrifuge for 2 min at 2,000 x g to remove bubbles. Note that it is important to ensure the rotor is properly balanced at this speed prior to centrifugation.\nUsing a low-magnification inverted microscope, verify bubbles have been removed from the microwells.\nAdd 0.4 ml cell suspension at the required density (calculated above). Gently mix by pipetting up and down, without introducing air bubbles into the microwells. It is important to ensure that the cells are evenly distributed throughout the well, in order to obtain consistent spheroids.",
    "Centrifuge for 5 min at 200 x g. If the plate does not self-level during centrifugation, convection currents may arise that result in uneven distribution of cells across the microwells. Therefore, the plate should be balanced internally as well as against the other plate, so that the weight is distributed evenly to both sides of the plate carrier.\nNOTE: If evidence of uneven cell distribution is seen, it may be necessary to apply a small amount of lubrication to the pivot points on the plate carrier - consult with centrifuge manufacturer for instructions.\nNOTE: Once the cells have been centrifuged into the microwells, they are reasonably resistant to washing out from minor motions of the plate. Abrupt movements that result in sloshing of the medium should be avoided, but transfer of the plate from centrifuge to microscope or incubator should not result in significant cell displacement.\nUsing an inverted microscope, verify that cells have clustered within the microwells, and that they are evenly distributed across the well.\nIncubate overnight at 37 °C.\nUsing an inverted microscope, observe the process of spheroid formation. Some cell lines will form compact spheroids within 24 hr, others may take longer. The progression from cluster to aggregate in HT29 cells is shown in Figure 2.\nRecover spheroids from the microwells and transfer to suspension culture by gently jetting them out with a pipette. Alternatively, maintain spheroids in situ with medium replacement8 - the duration depends on their initial size and growth rate, which define the time until they outgrow the microwells in which they were formed.",
    "To replace medium without losing spheroids, aspirate medium at the edge of the well using a Pasteur pipette. Slowly bring the tip down until it begins to draw liquid from the meniscus, and follow the meniscus down as it drops. Then add fresh medium against the well wall in the same place. A few spheroids may be lost, however if medium is always aspirated and replaced in the same position, this number will remain small in comparison to the large numbers in the well."
