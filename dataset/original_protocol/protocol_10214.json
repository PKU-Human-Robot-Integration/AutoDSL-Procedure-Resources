    "The protocol for the brain tissue extraction from day 1 Sprague Dawley rat pups, euthanized by decapitation, was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Alberta.\n1. Microglia and Astrocyte Isolations67,68\nNOTE: All media for isolation and cell culture is preheated to 37 °C in a water bath. Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) has 1% penicillin-streptomycin (PS). All Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media with Ham's F12 nutrient mixture (DMEM/F12) is supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (PS). Only mixtures with trypsin lack FBS. All materials in this protocol are sterile (filter, alcohol, purchased, and autoclaved) and every step subsequent to step number 1.8 is performed in a biosafety cabinet with aseptic technique.\nPer brain, pre-heat 15 mL of HBSS and 12.5 mL DMEM/F12 to 37 °C in 50 mL conical centrifuge tubes, and approximately 2 mL of 0.25% trypsin with 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube. Heat an additional 25 mL of DMEM/F12. Warm trypsin about 10 min prior to use to prevent loss of enzymatic activity.\nPour enough warm HBSS into sterile, 6 and 10 cm culture dishes to cover the surface. Prepare one 10 cm dish for every two brains plus an additional 6 cm dish.\nPlace up to 2 brains in each 10 cm2 dish (Figure 2A).\nUnder a dissection microscope, use curved and straight forceps to separate the cortices along the midline, and the cerebellum with brain stem. This yields three sections of tissue per brain (Figure 2B).",
    "Peel the thin, semi-transparent, layer (meninges) of tissue containing blood vessels from each section of tissue and discard, transferring the remaining tissue into a separate culture dish. Grasp the thin layers exposed by the tissue cuts, with the forceps, and carefully pull until major portions are 'hanging off' the brain tissue. Finally remove this portion by gently tugging. See Figure 2C-2E for representative images of before, during, and after this step.\nIn a biosafety cabinet, remove the remaining HBSS from the culture dish, carefully retaining the tissue. Macerate the tissue with a scalpel and transfer tissue to the pre-warmed 15 mL tube with trypsin.\nIncubate this tube for 25 min in a 37 °C bath to digest the tissue enzymatically.\nCentrifuge the tube down at 500 x g for 2 min at room temperature, and pour out the supernatant.\nUsing a 10 mL serological pipette, add 10 mL of warm DMEM/F12 to inactivate the trypsin and triturate the solution 5 times to break up the tissue.\nCentrifuge the tube down at 500 x g for 2 min at room temperature, and pour out the supernatant.\nUsing a 10 mL serological pipette, re-suspend pellet into 10 mL of warm DMEM/F12 and transfer the solution to a 50 mL Conical centrifuge tube.\nUsing a 10 mL syringe with an 18 gauge needle, triturate the solution 3 times.\nDistribute this solution into increments of 12.5 mL of warm DMEM/F12 per brain.\nPipette 1 mL increments of the triturated solution into a 12 well plate (1 per brain).\nIncubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2in a humidified cell culture incubator. Replace media after three days, and refresh media every subsequent three days. After 2 weeks, the cells can be collected for experiments.\n2. Macromer Synthesis69",
    "Weigh 375 mg of hyaluronic acid (HA) salt in a 50 mL conical centrifuge tube and add 37.5 mL of distilled water.\nFlush the solution with a vortexer for 1 min and sonicate the mixture until it appears homogenous and loses its gel-like viscosity. This process may take 6 h.\nTransfer solution to a 100 mL beaker with a magnetic stir bar (38 mm), and stir vigorously at room temperature.\nCarefully titrate 5.0 M NaOH into the mixing HA and measure with pH paper until the pH stabilizes between 8 and 12.\nCollect 3 mL of fresh methacrylic anhydride (MA, 94%), blanketed by nitrogen during storage.\n\tNOTE: MA is exposed to the atmosphere for long durations (days), it will lose its reactivity.\n\tCaution: All use of MA should be done in a fume hood.\nAdd 200 µL of MA into the mixing HA solution. The reaction lowers the pH of the solution below 8.\nRepeat steps 2.4 to 2.6 until the 3 mL of MA have been added to the solution. This process may take up to 1-2 h.\nAllow the reaction to continue overnight at 4 °C, without mixing.\nTransfer solution to 400 mL of cold ethanol (EtOH) in a 500 mL beaker and allow precipitation for 24 - 72 h at 4 °C.56\nCarefully decant the major portion of the solution into a separate beaker for disposal, and collect the precipitate in a 50 mL conical centrifuge tube. This may be distributed in 2-4 tubes, if necessary.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 200 x g in a centrifuge for 2 min at room temperature and dispose of the supernatant.\nTop up the tube with cold EtOH, mix the solution with a vortexer for 1 min, and repeat step 2.10-2.11.",
    "Add 25 mL of sterile deionized water, mix the solution with a vortexer for 1 min, sonicate (>20 kHz) for 1 h, and incubate at 4 °C overnight.\nPlace the solution in a -80 °C freezer for 15 min or until frozen or flash freeze in liquid nitrogen.\n\tCAUTION: When using liquid nitrogen, use protective gloves, a face shield, and an apron.\nFreeze dry the tube (below 0.1 mBar and -30 °C) for 24 - 48 h until a snow-like powder is produced.\nAt this point, test the sample for purity via 1H nuclear magnetic resonance, where the amount of methacrylate protons (peaks at 6.1 and 5.6 ppm), relative to methyl protons (1.9 ppm), on the HA backbone can be confirmed. A minimum ratio of 95% methacrylate to methyl protons is acceptable.69\n3. Gel Formation and 3D Encapsulation65\nCoverslip and Mold Preparation\nMake a 50 mL distilled water solution of 2% 3-(Trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate in a 50 mL conical centrifuge tube.\nPlace 18 mm glass coverslips in solution and rock for 1 h at room temperature. Up to 50 coverslips can be added at once.\nRinse coverslips by serially dipping each in 3 beakers of 100 mL deionized water.\nDry the coverslips in a vacuum at 40 °C overnight with a desiccator and oven.\nQuickly immerse individual coverslips in 70% EtOH with forceps.\nWithout drying, drop each coverslip into a well of a 12 well plate.\nWash and aspirate each well with sterile deionized water (1 mL per well).\nAdd 1 mL of sterile 2 µg /mL poly-L-lysine (PLL) to each well and incubate for >2 h.\nAspirate PLL solution and allow the coverslips to air dry.",
    "Immerse polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) molds (see Figure 1) in 70% EtOH, and place one upon the center of each coverslip, and allow to air dry and create a seal between the mold and glass.\n\t\t\nPrepare PDMS molds by casting PDMS premix reagents in a 10:1 ratio in a flat-bottomed polystyrene dish. The quantity of PDMS prepared is selected to yield a sheet approximately 1 mm thick. To form wells in the PDMS, cut the sheets with a circle punch with an inner diameter of 10.\nCell Preparation\n\tNOTE: All steps in the protocol are performed with sterile technique in a biosafety cabinet. The phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution is adjusted to pH 7.4 for all steps.\n\t\n24 h prior to cell encapsulation in HAMA, refresh the medium for the 2 week primary cultures (from Step 1.15) in the 12 well plates. Add 1 mL of DMEM/F12 (10% FBS and 1% PS) medium per well.\nFor each 12-well plate of cells prepare 12.5 mL of dilute trypsin (0.25% trypsin-EDTA diluted 30% with DMEM/F12 media), and 25 mL DMEM/F12 (10% FBS and 1% PS) and warm in at 37 °C in a water bath.\nCollect conditioned medium from plates using a 10 mL serological pipette (> 0.5 mL per well), thoroughly aspirate remaining liquid, and replace with 1 mL per well of dilute trypsin (0.075% trypsin-EDTA) for 20-30 min in an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) until the confluent cell layer detaches from the plate.\nRecover suspended cell material with a 1 mL pipette (appears as a single floating piece) and collect in a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube. Dilute with an equivalent volume of DMEM/F12 (10% FBS and 1% PS), and centrifuge at 200 x g for 2 min at room temperature, discarding the supernatant.",
    "Resuspend the cell pellet in 10 mL warm DMEM/F12 (10% FBS and 1% PS), triturate the cells 5 times with a 10 mL pipette, and centrifuge at 200 x g for 2 min.\nDecant the supernatant, re-suspend the cells in 5 mL warm DMEM/F12, and transfer the cells to a 50 mL conical centrifuge tube.\nUsing a 10 mL syringe with a 18 gauge needle, triturate the cell solution 3 times, and filter the suspension through a 40 µm cell sieve into a new conical centrifuge tube.\nCollect 10 µL of cell suspension, dilute 1:100 in warm DMEM/F12, and count cells with an automated cell counter\nIncubate in a 37 °C water bath until encapsulation step.\nCell Encapsulation\n\tNOTE: All steps in the protocol are performed with sterile technique in a biosafety cabinet.\n\t\nFor each 12-well plate of 3D hydrogels warm 12.5 mL of DMEM/F12 and 12.5 mL of the conditioned DMEM/F12 media collected during cell preparation.\nWeigh the quantity of methacrylated hyaluronic acid (HAMA) required for a final concentration of 0.5% wt/vol. Dissolve this HAMA in sterile filtered PBS at a concentration of (2% wt/vol); a concentration 4 times higher than the final concentration is utilized to accommodate the addition of cells and other reagents. One 12 well plate of hydrogels requires ~350 µL PBS with 7 mg HAMA.\nSonicate (>20 kHz) solutions until HAMA is fully dissolved for 60 min.\nPrepare individual 10% solutions of both triethanolamine (TEA) and 1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NVP), and a 1 mM solution of Eosin Y (EY) in 1 mL aliquots of sterile PBS pH 7.4.",
    "For one 12 well plate, make a final 1.4 mL mixture of 1 x 107 cells, 0.5% wt/vol HAMA (350 µL of 2% wt/vol), 0.1% TEA (14 µL of 10%), 0.1% NVP (14 µL of 10%), and 0.01 mM EY (14 µL of 1 mM), and 20% basal lamina mixture (280 µL of stock). The remaining volume is PBS.\nGently mix the solution and pipette 100 µL into each PDMS mold with a 1 mL tip.\nExpose samples to a high intensity green LED light (~520 nm, 60 mW, in an enclosed 20 cm x 20 cm x 20 cm box) for 5 min at room temperature.\nAdd 1 mL per well of warm conditioned DMEM/F12 to a 12 well plate.\nGrasp each coverslip between thumb and forefinger, slowly peel the PDMS mold off with curved tweezers being careful not to displace the gel, and place it into a well with conditioned medium.\nAdd an additional 1 mL warm DMEM/F12 to each well.\nIncubate plates at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 2 weeks, refreshing cell media every week by pipetting 1 mL of media from each wells and replacing with 1 mL DMEM/F12.\n4. Microscopy\nImmunocytochemistry\n\tNOTE: An inverted confocal microscope was used to image these samples and ImageJ was used to process and display the images. Microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and nuclei, will be labeled after 3 weeks in the HAMA culture.\n\t\nPreheat 10% PBS-buffered formalin (pH 7.0) in a 37 °C bath.\n\t\tCaution: Although formalin can be used outside a fume hood, this material is reactive with tissue, and should be handle with care and gloves always. It should be dispose separately.\nCarefully aspirate media from the plates and pipette 1 mL of 10% formalin to each well.",
    "Incubate the plates at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 for 20 min.\nAspirate liquid from each plate, pipette 2 mL of PBS (pH 7.4) into each well, and incubate for 15 min.\nRepeat step 4.1.4 twice.\nAspirate liquid from the plates, add 1 mL per well of PBS with 10% normal horse serum (NHS) and 0.5% triton X-100, and gently rock at minimum speed) for 1 h.\nRepeat step 4.1.4 three times.\nAspirate liquid and add 1 mL per well of the following mixture in PBS: rabbit ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule (Iba1) 1:1,000, chicken glial fibrillary protein (GFAP) 1:5,000, mouse 2',3'-cyclic-nucelotide 3'-phophodiesterase (CNPase) 1:1,000, 1% NHS, and 0.1% cell perforating surfactant.

Incubate at room temperature for 1 h, gently rocking the plate.\nRepeat step 4 three times with 1 h incubations in between.\nTo preserve the hydrogels, aspirate buffer, and immerse them in 0.5 mL of cell mounting medium for 1 min. Pipette out the mounting medium and gently place a coverslip on top of the gel, creating a layer between the glass. Add a small amount of mounting medium to the uncovered side of the coverslips to prevent drying of the hydrogel.\n\t\tNOTE: For troubleshooting purposes, gels can be imaged at step 4.1.11. to see proper labeling before further processing.\nScanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)\n\tNOTE: To visualize the hydrogel, a scanning electron microscope was used to image these samples.",
    "Pre-heat a fixative mixture of 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS (0.1 M) in a 37 °C water bath.\n\t\tCaution: These reagents are highly reactive with tissues, and should be handled with care and gloves. They should be handled in a fume hood as much as possible and disposed separately.\nAspirate medium from the cell culture plates and add 1 mL of the pre-heated fixative mixture.\nIncubate the plates at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 for 20 min.\nPlace the plates in 4 °C (fridge/cooler) overnight.\nAspirate the fixative solution from the wells and add 1 mL of PBS.\nAspirate liquid from each plate, add 2 mL of PBS into each well, and incubate for 15 min.\nRepeat step 4.2.6 two more times.\nAspirate the PBS and add 1 mL of 1% osmium tetraoxide buffered in PBS to each well.\n\t\tNOTE: Until samples are dried, this step and all subsequent steps are performed in a fume hood.\nAllow fixation to occur for 30 min. Osmium vapor from the liquid can fix other samples in the same plate; therefore, partition samples accordingly before this step.\n\t\tCAUTION: Osmium tetraoxide is highly reactive with tissue and volatile. It is dangerous and should be handled in the fume hood with gloves. It and any immediate washed should be disposed separately.\nRepeat step 4.2.6 three times.\nAspirate the liquid and add the dehydrating mixtures in the list below, in order, and incubate (room temperature) for the indicated time. Start by gradually adding ethanol (EtOH) followed then hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS). See Table 2 for each increment.",
    "NOTE: When adding HMDS, the coverslips can strongly adhere to the plastic and become very difficult to remove. This can be prevented by placing a small plastic platform under the glass slip after the first application of HMDS. After the second EtOH incubation, the sample can be taken out and quenched in liquid nitrogen for few seconds to freeze fracture the sample.\nCarefully remove the dried samples and mount the samples on scanning electron microscope stubs with double sided conductive tape.\nSputter coat the samples with a minimum amount of gold. Place the samples in a holder and operate the machine for 2 min at 15 mA.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
