    "1. Preparation of cell-laden SF-GelMA\nSterilize all the materials by using 0.22 μm syringe filter units. Perform all the steps in a biological safety cabinet.\nWarm 1x PBS to 50 °C, and dissolve gelatin in the heated 1x PBS with stirring. The final concentration of gelatin in PBS should be 10% (w/v).\nAdd methacrylic anhydride into the gelatin solution (weight ratio of methacrylic anhydride to gelatin of 0.6 to 1) slowly with stirring, and mix the complex for at least 1 h (50 °C). Typically, prepare 200 mL of 10% gelatin solution with 12 g of methacrylic anhydride; the volume depends on the needs of the study.\nTransfer the mixed solution containing gelatin and methacrylic anhydride to a 50 mL sterile tube.\nCentrifuge the mixed solution at 3,500 x g. It usually takes 3-5 min to obtain two layers. Collect the upper layer (GelMA) and discard the bottom layer (unreacted methacrylic anhydride).\nDilute the upper layer solution obtained in step 1.5 with two volumes of deionized water (40−50 °C).\nDialyze the solution obtained in step 1.6 with a 12-14 kDa molecular weight cutoff dialysis membrane against deionized water for 5−7 days (40−50 °C). Change the water twice every day.\nCollect and freeze the GelMA solution at −80 °C overnight.\nLyophilize the GelMA solution for 3−5 days in a freeze dryer with the temperature set to -45 °C and the pressure set to 0.2 mbar.\nDissolve the lyophilized GelMA (degree of substitution of approximately 75%) in 1x PBS containing 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum, v/v), 25 mM HEPES (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N-ethane-sulfonic acid), and photoinitiator (0.5%, w/v) to obtain the GelMA bioink preparation.\n\tNOTE: The degree of substitution of GelMA can be calculated by a ninhydrin assay3.",
    "Mix the GelMA solution (10%, w/v) with different volumes of initial SF solution (5%, w/v) and different volumes of 1x PBS to obtain SF-GelMA bioinks with different concentrations of SF. The proportion per 1 mL of GelMA and SF solution in the different bioinks is presented in Table 1.\n\tNOTE: All bioinks must contain a final concentration of 5% (w/v) GelMA, but the concentration of SF varies: 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, and 1.5% (w/v) in the different SF-GelMA bioinks. Use SF-M-Layered-GelMA to term the GelMA bioink modified with SF in a layer-by-layer manner. Use SF-X-GelMA to term those GelMA modified with SF in a homogeneous manner (e.g., GelMA with modification of 1% SF was termed SF-1-GelMA).\nSonicate all bioinks for 10-20 min.\nGrow NIH3T3 cells using DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium) containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in an incubator (37 °C with 5% CO2). Passage the cells at a ratio of 1:3 when the density reaches 80%.\nCentrifuge the suspension of NIH3T3 cells at 1500 rpm for 5 min. Remove the supernatant with suction and resuspend the cell pellet with fresh bioink solution in a 15 mL sterile tube.\n\tNOTE: The concentration of the encapsulated cells in the bioink should be 1 x 106 cells/mL, and the concentration needs to be calculated with a cytometer.\nUse 2 mL of different SF-GelMA bioinks to suspend the cell pellets to obtain various cell-laden bioinks.\n2. Loading, reheating and bioprinting of the SF-M-Layered-GelMA\nLoad 0.4 mL of cell-laden SF-0.5-GelMA into the bottom layer of the syringe.\n\tNOTE: Use a 2 mL syringe as the bioink reservoir in this study. Load different SF-GelMA bioinks into the syringe in a layer-by-layer manner.",
    "Place the syringe in ice water bath (0 °C) for 5 min to cause the bottom-layer bioink to transform into a gel state.\nLoad 0.4 mL of cell-laden SF-0.75-GelMA bioink above the bottom layer.\nPlace the syringe with the two layers of bioinks in an ice water bath (0 °C) for 5 min to cause the two layers of bioinks to transform into a gel state.\nCycle the loading and cooling steps another 3 times with the remaining 3 kinds of bioinks (SF-1-GelMA, SF-1.25-GelMA, SF-1.5-GelMA) to obtain a multilayered bioink system with different concentrations of SF in the different layers. The volume used for the loading of all bioinks should be 0.4 mL.\nReheat the multilayered bioink by placing the syringe in an incubator (37 °C) for 30 min prior to bioprinting.\nUse a 2 mL syringe as the bioink reservoir with a 27 G printing nozzle. Set the speed of flow at 50 μL/min, the moving speed of the nozzle at 2 mm/s, and the height of the nozzle at 1 mm. Perform the bioprinting procedure at room temperature (approximately 20 °C).\n\t\nPrint the tissue construct in an extrusion manner using a custom-made bioprinter under the parameters adapted from our previous studies11,12.\nUse ultraviolet light (365 nm, 800 mW) for 40 s to crosslink the bioprinted tissue construct.\nCulture the crosslinked tissue construct in DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium) containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in an incubator (37 °C with 5% CO2). The medium was changed every 8 h during the first 2 days and every 2-3 days thereafter.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
