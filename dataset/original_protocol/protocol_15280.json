    "1. Whole Blood Collection\nCollect venous blood from humans or from experimental animals in NEM/EDTA containing tubes.\nImmediately spin down blood in a benchtop centrifuge at 14,300 rcf (relative centrifugal force) for 7 minutes to prepare plasma and red blood cell pellet.\nPrepare plasma samples for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and chemiluminescence detection (CLD) analysis.\n\tHPLC: Add 1:1 volume of cold methanol to plasma, vortex and centrifuge at 13,200 rpm for 10 minutes to precipitate plasma proteins. Collect supernatant for HPLC analysis.\n\tCLD: aliquot a sample and preincubate with sulfanilamide and mercuric chloride to specifically assay nitrosothiols.\nPrepare red cell pellet for HPLC and CLD analysis.\n\tHPLC: Add 1:4 red cell pellet to a hypotonic lysis solution containing 10 mM NEM, 2.5 mM EDTA and 10 mM ferricyanide. Vortex thoroughly and then add 1:1 methanol, vortex and centrifuge at 13,200 rpm for 10 minutes to precipitate protein. Collect supernatant for HPLC analysis.\n\tCLD. Add 1:4 red cell pellet to a hypotonic lysis solution containing 10 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM EDTA and 10 mM Ferricyanide. Aliquot samples to tubes containing sulfanilamide and mercuric chloride for specific detection of nitrosothiols.\n2. Tissue Extraction and Preparation\nTo determine tissue levels of NO metabolites, it is first necessary to harvest blood free tissue for sample preparation as described above. A full blood exchange will take place by infusing physiological buffer through the apex of the left ventricle. Once all blood is removed, tissues of interest can then be harvested.\nHomogenize tissue samples and prepare samples as described above for HPLC and CLD analysis.\n3. Aortic Rings Isolation for Endothelial Function\nTissue Organ Bath",
    "Mice will be anesthetized with diethyl ether until no longer responsive to toe pinch, and undergo cervical dislocation prior to surgery.  A thoracotomy is performed to expose thoracic and abdominal aorta. A 25 gauge syringe is inserted into the apex of left ventricle and perfused free of blood with oxygenated Krebs Henseleit buffer.\nThe right atrium is cut to provide an exit for blood. Abdominal aorta will be removed and cleaned of adventitia.\nRings will be cut into 2 mm long segments and mounted on a four-channel tissue organ bath (DMT 720MO, AD Instruments) bathed in a physiological buffer solution.\nVessel rings are maintained in 10-ml organ baths with oxygenated Krebs buffer (95% O2 and 5% CO2) at 37 °C. One gram pretension is placed on each aortic ring (appropriate starting tension for optimal vasomotor function as determined in previous experiments). An eight-channel octal bridge (Powerlab) and data-acquisition software (Chart version 5.2.2) are used to record all force measurements.\nRings are allowed to equilibrate for 80 minutes with the buffer in each organ bath changed every 20 min. After equilibration for 80 min, 1 μM phenylephrine is added to each ring for submaximal contraction.\nAfter stabilization, endothelial agonist such as acetylcholine will be added to determine NO production and degree of vessel relaxation. After the dose response to acetylcholine, baths will be rinsed and recontracted and then treated with an exogenous source of nitric oxide, sodium nitroprusside to determine responsiveness of smooth muscle and to get a value for 100% relaxation.\nNO scavengers can be added to bath to clearly illustrate release of NO and inhibition of vessel relaxation.\n4. Representative Results",
    "Use of the ENO-20 dedicated HPLC provides an easy to use high throughput method for specific and sensitive detection of nitrite and nitrate in biological matrices. The principle of detection and an original chromatogram is shown in Figure 1. This method can be used for any biological sample for determining nitrite and nitrate. CLD based detection of NO metabolites requires a chemical derivitization step to determine the molecular source of the NO. The experimental setup for simultaneous oxidative denitrosation and reductive denitrosation for the chemiluminescence detector is shown in Figure 2. The reaction vessel on the right is filled with 800mM ferricyanide in PBS pH 7.4 and the reaction vessel on the left is filled with potassium iodide/iodine mixture in acetic acid for reduction denitrosation (Figure 2A). The entire setup is shown in Figure 2B. Figure 3 illustrates group specific denitrosation assays that can detect and quantify nitrite, nitrosothiols, nitrosamines as well as nitrosyl heme products. This method has been previously described and validated4,5. These important biochemical analyses can easily be correlated with functional studies on isolated aortic rings to determine endothelial NO production in experimental animals. This classical pharmacological experiment can easily and accurately assess endothelial NO function and production. Measuring vessel reactivity to endothelial agonists such as acetylcholine can directly determine endothelial NO production which can then be correlated with biochemical biomarkers detected in blood and tissue of the experimental animals. A typical representation of a dose response to acetylcholine is shown in Figure 4. Healthy control mice with normal endothelial function respond to acetylcholine by relaxing. Mice with endothelial dysfunction (hypercholesterolemic mice) show reduced relaxation due to reduced NO production to the same stimulus.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3722/3722fig1.jpg",
