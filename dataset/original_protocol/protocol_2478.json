    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nWe provide a detailed step-by-step protocol for purification of recombinant AvrSr35 and Sr35, assembly of the Sr35 resistosome, sample preparation for negative staining and cryo-EM, and cryo-EM structure determination.\nExpression and purification of recombinant AvrSr35ΔSP\nTiming: 6–8 days total (4–5 days for step 1; 2–3 days for step 2)\nThe production of recombinant AvrSr35ΔSP includes two main steps: plasmid construction and protein purification. The steps are described below.\nPreparation of AvrSr35ΔSP plasmid. The process of recombinant AvrSr35ΔSP plasmid construction are described as below steps.\nObtain plasmid carrying the full-length coding sequence of wild-type AvrSr35.\nNote: The full-length coding sequence of AvrSr35 was retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database (GenBank: MF474174.1) and cloned by company (Beijing Shengyuan Kemeng Gene Biotechnology Co., Ltd) into the pET28a vector between BamHІ and XhoІ sites.\nDesign primers to remove sequence encoding 1–26 amino acids from the full-length coding sequence of AvrSr35 by PCR, thus generating the AvrSr35ΔSP construct. Primer design is shown in Oligonucleotides of KRT.\nNote: Amino acid residues 1–26 of AvrSr35 have been predicted to encode a signal peptide that is not required for this study.\nPerform PCR with the pET28a-AvrSr35 vector as a template to generate the AvrSr35ΔSP construct. For a detailed description of the PCR reaction system and cycling conditions, please refer to PCR reaction and PCR cycling conditions tables.\nRun a 1% agarose gel at 120 V to verify the size and purity of PCR products. The size of the target PCR product is 1,653 bp. Excise the target PCR product (i.e., PCR-amplified insert) from the gel and recover it using the OMEGA Gel Extraction Kit or another similar kit. The recovered product can be quantified by Nanodrop.\nTreat the recovered PCR-amplified AvrSr35ΔSP insert with T4 DNA polymerase.",
    "Prepare the reaction system as detailed in the Treatment with T4 DNA polymerase table, adding 1 μL of T4 DNA polymerase into 200 ng of the PCR-amplified AvrSr35ΔSP insert.\nIncubate the reaction at 20°C–25°C for 30 min.\nAfterward, incubate the reaction system at 75°C for 20 min to eliminate T4 DNA polymerase activity.\nKeep at 4°C or −20°C until the ligation-independent cloning (LIC) step.\nLinearize the pMCSG7 vector using the SspI restriction endonuclease. Prepare the reaction system according to the Vector linearization with SspI table and incubate the reaction at 37°C for 2 h.\nTreat the linearized pMCSG7 vector with T4 DNA polymerase as described in step e.\nNote: Following treatment with T4 DNA polymerase, vectors and inserts can be stored long-term at −80°C after flash freezing via liquid nitrogen.\nLigation-independent cloning. Mix the PCR-amplified AvrSr35ΔSP insert and the pMCSG7 vector as described in Ligation-independent cloning (LIC) reaction table and incubate on ice for 30 min.\nTransform the ligation product pMCSG7-AvrSr35ΔSP into DH5α competent cells and plate the transformants onto LB agar plates containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin.\nIncubate the plates at 37°C for 12–15 h.\nUse a single large bacterial colony to inoculate 5 mL of LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin. Culture at 37°C and 220 rpm for 12 h.\nExtract and purify plasmid DNA using the Omega Plasmid Mini Kit or similar plasmid extraction kit.\nSequence the recombinant plasmid to confirm that the sequence of the pMCSG7-AvrSr35ΔSP is correct before proceeding to the next step.\nPause point: The bacterial cultures can be stored short-term at 4°C as suspensions or long-term at −20°C – −80°C as pellets. Extracted plasmid samples can be stored at −20°C until further use.",
    "Note: The crystal structure of AvrSr35ΔSP reported by Zhao et al. (Zhao et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). shows that the asymmetric unit contains two AvrSr35 molecules forming a homodimer. The residue R381 located at the dimeric interface plays a key role in maintaining the homodimer conformation. Replacing R381 with alanine almost completely abolished the AvrSr35-AvrSr35 interaction and significantly weakened the interaction between AvrSr35 and Sr35. To explore the relationship between AvrSr35 dimerization and the activation of Sr35, the AvrSr35ΔSP_R381A mutant was also cloned into the pMCSG7 vector to analyze its capacity for inducing the Sr35 resistosome.\nPurification of recombinant AvrSr35ΔSP. This section describes the purification of AvrSr35ΔSP by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography.\nTransform the pMCSG7-AvrSr35ΔSP plasmid into the E. coli Rosetta (DE3) protein expression strain. Plate the transformants onto LB agar plates containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 50 μg/mL chloramphenicol.\nPick a single, large colony with a sterile pipette tip and use it to inoculate 100 mL of liquid LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 50 μg/mL chloramphenicol. Culture at 37°C and 220 rpm for 12 h.\nExpand the bacterial culture. Dilute the 100 mL starter culture at a 1:100 ratio in 1 L of LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 50 μg/mL chloramphenicol. Culture at 37°C and 220 rpm until the OD600 value of the culture reaches 0.6–0.8.\nInduce overexpression of AvrSr35ΔSP. Add 300 μL of 1 M IPTG to each flask with bacterial culture (final concentration of IPTG is 0.3 mM). Express the protein at 18°C and 220 rpm for 12–15 h.\nPellet the bacteria by centrifuging the culture at 3,100 × g and 4°C for 15 min. Discard the supernatant and collect the pelleted bacteria.",
    "Note: Unless proceeding immediately to the next step, pelleted bacteria should be stored at −20°C – −80°C.\nResuspend the bacterial pellet in pre-chilled Lysis buffer 1 by vortexing or rocking on a platform until completely resuspended.\nNote: BME and PMSF should be added immediately before using Lysis buffers.\nNote: The volume of Lysis buffer used for resuspending the bacterial pellets depends on the size of bacterial pellets. In this study, we used 20 mL of Lysis buffer per 1 L of pelleted bacterial culture.\nDisrupt the bacteria using a French press at 800 bar.\nNote: Due to the poor thermal stability of the protein, the French press must be pre-cooled to 4°C before lysis.\nAlternatives: Cells can be disrupted by sonication instead of French press.\nCentrifuge the lysate at 10,540 × g for 30 min at 4°C to separate supernatant from cell debris and unbroken cells.\nLoad the supernatant onto a Ni-NTA affinity column. Allow the supernatant to pass through the column at a flow rate of ∼0.8 mL/min to ensure efficient binding of the target protein binds column matrix.\nNote: Before loading the supernatant, Ni-NTA affinity column should be equilibrated with 5 column volumes of Lysis buffer 1.\nWash the Ni-NTA beads with 5 column volumes of Lysis buffer 1.\nCarry out elution with Lysis buffer 1 containing 20 mM imidazole, followed by Lysis buffer 1 containing 200 mM imidazole. Collect the eluate in separate tubes.\nNote: The Bradford reagent can be used to detect the presence of proteins in the eluate. Once no protein can be detected with the Bradford reagent, stop washing the column with the same buffer and then continue the elution process with a buffer containing a higher concentration of imidazole.",
    "Alternatives: In this protocol, the process of Ni-NTA purification is carried out on the bench. The high Performance-liquid chromatography (HPLC) can also be used for the purification. Protein elution process can be monitored by the absorbance at 280 nm.\nCollect the eluate from each tube and mix it with protein loading buffer. Perform SDS-PAGE gel analysis (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). Select the eluates containing AvrSr35ΔSP with good purity. Monitor the absorbance at 280 nm and the ratio of A260/A280 via Nanodrop. The A260/A280 ratio should be 0.5–0.7.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2113-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Concentrate and adjust the sample volume to 15 mL.\nLoad the protein sample onto an SP FF cation exchange chromatography ion column at 4°C and at a flow rate of 1 mL/min using a peristaltic pump.",
    "Note: Before sample loading, the SP FF column should be washed using at least five column volumes of Buffer B (25 mM MES (pH 6.0), 1 M NaCl, 2 mM DTT), followed by equilibration with five column volumes of Buffer A. Washing and equilibration can be performed at a flow rate of 2 mL/min. Moreover, the flow rate of sample loading can also be increased but should not exceed 2 mL/min to allow efficient binding of the protein sample onto column matrix.\nAlternatives: This step can also be completed using an HPLC.\nPurification with ion-exchange chromatography (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nMount the SP FF column onto a chromatography system, such as the ÄKTA pure, at 4°C. Elute the target protein using a NaCl gradient between Buffer A and Buffer B at a flow rate of 1 mL/min and steady buffer B increase from 0% to 60% over 20 min. An elution peak can be observed between a 45%–60% NaCl gradient.\nThen, resume the buffer B increase from 60% to 100% after the peak is fully eluted. Collect fractions containing protein peaks and run SDS-PAGE analysis.\nSelect fractions corresponding to purified AvrSr35ΔSP for further purification.\nUsing centrifugal filter (MWCO = 50 kDa), pool the purified AvrSr35ΔSP, replace the buffer system into SEC buffer 1 (25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT), and then concentrate the sample.\nQuantify the concentration (30–40 absorption units/mL when concentrated to 0.5 mL) using a spectrophotometer and aliquot it appropriately in a sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes so that the absorbance at 280 nm (A280) does not exceed 1000 absorption units. Adjust the volume of each sample to the required volume for SEC.",
    "Note: Before injecting the concentrated AvrSr35ΔSP sample into a size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) column centrifuge it at 7,440 × g at 4°C for 15 min. Some denatured protein may precipitate out of solution. In such cases, the sample should be injected carefully to avoid resuspending the sediment and clogging the pores within column matrix.\nPurification with size-exclusion chromatography (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nInject the prepared AvrSr35ΔSP sample via the sample loop into a Superdex 200 (10/300 GL) SEC column of 24 mL volume which is equilibrated with at least one column volume of SEC buffer 1.\nPerform the purification at the flow rate of 0.5–0.8 mL/min.\nCollect fractions containing protein peaks and run SDS-PAGE analysis.\nNote: SEC buffer 1 should be degassed by sonication or negative pressure chamber and cooled to 4°C before use.\nUsing centrifugal filter (MWCO = 50 kDa), pool and concentrate the fractions containing pure and homogeneous AvrSr35ΔSP to 15–30 mg/mL. The purified AvrSr35ΔSP can be stored at −80°C until further use.\nNote: The protein samples were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at −80°C.\nExpression and purification of recombinant Sr35\nTiming: about 20 days total: 4–5 days for step 3; ∼1 week for step 4; 8 hr for step 5; ∼7–8 days for step 6; ∼2 days for step 7\nSince Sr35 was difficult to express in E. coli, SF9 insect expression system was used instead. Detailed protocols for preparation of Sr35 plasmid and expression and purification of recombinant Sr35 are provided below.\nPreparation Sumo-pFastBac1-Sr35 plasmid. The process of recombinant plasmid construction is described as below.",
    "Retrieve full-length coding sequence of the Sr35 from NCBI database (GenBank: MT165900.1). The sequence should be inserted between BamHI and XhoI sites of the pFastBac1 transformation vector containing a 6×His-tag and SUMO tag upstream of the multiple cloning site. Primer design is shown in KRT.\nUse the primers containing the BamHI and XhoI recognition sites for PCR amplification of full-length Sr35 gene. The PCR reaction system and reaction conditions are described in the PCR reaction and PCR cycling conditions tables.\nRun a 1% agarose gel electrophoresis with the PCR products.

Quantify the concentration of recovered PCR-amplified insert.\nDouble-digest the PCR-amplified insert and SUMO-pFastBac1 vector separately using BamHI and XhoI restriction enzymes by incubating at 37°C for 2 h. Detailed reaction system is described in the BamHI/XhoI double digestion reaction table.\nRun a 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Excise the digested PCR-amplified insert (919 bp) and SUMO-pFastBac1 (∼5,000 bp) vector bands and recover them using the OMEGA Gel Extraction Kit or another similar kit. Quantify the concentration of recovered digestion products.\nMix the recovered PCR-amplified insert and SUMO-pFastBac1 vector at a molar concentration ratio of 3:1 and incubate with T4 DNA ligase at 37°C for 4 h. Detailed reaction system is described in the Ligation reaction table.\nTransform the ligation product into DH5α competent cells and plate the transformants onto LB agar plates containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin.\nIncubate the plates at 37°C for 12–15 h.\nUse a single large bacterial colony to inoculate 10 mL of LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin.

    "Sequence the recombinant plasmid to confirm that the sequence of the pFastBac1-Sr35 is correct before proceeding to the next step.\nPause point: The bacterial cultures can be stored short-term at 4°C as suspensions or long-term at −20°C – −80°C as pellets. Extracted plasmid samples can be stored at −20°C until further use.\nPreparation and isolation of bacmid. In the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system, DH10Bac competent cells are commonly used to produce recombinant bacmids. DH10Bac competent cells contain a tetracycline resistance gene and can improve the transposition efficiency of Sumo-pFastBac1. The isolation of Sumo-pFastBac1-Sr35 bacmids is carried out as follows:\nPlace vials with 100 μL of DH10Bac competent cells on ice until the cells are thawed.\nMix 100 ng of the Sumo-pFastBac1-Sr35 with thawed DH10Bac competent cells using a sterile pipette tip. Incubate on ice for 30 min, heat shock cells in a 42°C water bath for 45 s, and then return to the ice for 2–3 min.\nAdd 900 μL of SOC media to the DH10Bac competent cells. Incubate at 37°C and 220 rpm for 4–5 h.\nPlate the cells onto SOC agar containing 50 mg/mL kanamycin, 7 mg/mL gentamicin, 10 mg/mL tetracycline, 200 mg/mL Bluo-Gal, and 40 mg/mL IPTG. Incubate at 37°C for 48–72 h.\nNote: During incubation, the plates need to be completely protected from light. The common method is to wrap the plates in aluminum foil.\nAfter 48–72 h of incubation, blue and white colonies will appear on the plates. Use a single, large white colony to inoculate 20 mL of SOC medium supplemented with 50 μg/mL kanamycin, 7 μg/mL gentamicin, and 10 μg/mL tetracycline. Culture at 37°C and 220 rpm for 24 h.",
    "Centrifuge the culture at 3,100 × g for 30 min. Discard the supernatant and keep the cell pellet. Collect cell pellets in a 1.5 mL-microcentrifuge tube.\nPerform bacmid extraction with a QIAGEN Plasmid Mini Kit.\nNote: The following steps of bacmid extraction need to be performed under sterile conditions in a laminar flow hood.\nAlternatives: We use reagents from the QIAGEN mini prep kit. Reagents from other mini prep kits can also be used.\nAdd 300 μL of Buffer P1 to the tube and resuspend the cells thoroughly.\nNote: Ensure that RNase A has been added to Buffer P1.\nAdd 300 μL of Buffer P2 and gently invert the microcentrifuge tube 4–6 times to allow thorough mixing. Leave at room temperature until the color of the solution fully changes to blue (approximately 5 min). The color change is due to the addition of LyseBlue reagent to Buffer P1.\nAdd 300 μL of ice-cold Buffer P3. Mix by gently inverting the microcentrifuge tube 4–6 times, or until the blue color disappears completely. Afterward, incubate the tube for 5 min on ice.\nCentrifuge at 7,440 × g and 4°C for 10 min.\nIn the meantime, equilibrate the QIAGEN-tip by adding 5 volumes of Buffer QBT. Allow the column to empty by gravity flow.\nTransfer supernatant containing DNA onto an equilibrated QIAGEN-tip and allow it to flow through the column.\nWash the QIAGEN-tip twice with 2 mL of Buffer QC.\nElute bacmid DNA by adding 800 μL of Buffer QN to the QIAGEN-tip and allowing it to flow through the column. Collect the eluate into a sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 560 μL of sterile isopropanol into the tube containing eluted DNA. Centrifuge at 7,440 × g and 4°C for 30 min.",
    "Precipitated DNA should appear on the bottom of the tube in form of a white pellet. Carefully decant the supernatant and add 1 mL of ice-cold 70% ethanol. Invert the tube gently several times to wash the DNA pellet.\nCentrifuge at 7,440 × g and 4°C for 10 min. Discard the supernatant carefully.\nAir-dry the pellet for 15–20 min at room temperature, and then dissolve the DNA in 30 μL of TE buffer.\nStore the purified recombinant bacmid at −20°C.\nNote: The recombinant bacmid can be stored long-term at −80°C.\nThis next section describes the expression of recombinant Sr35 in SF9 insect expression system and the process of purification.\nTransfection of recombinant bacmid\nCulture Sf9 insect cells in Sf-900 II medium containing 50 units/mL penicillin and 50 μg/mL streptomycin. The cells should look healthy, and no cell clumping should be observed.\nPipette Sf9 cells into a six-well plate so that each well contains up to 8 × 105 cells. Add fresh antibiotic-free Sf-900 II medium to increase the total volume of the cell suspension to 2.5 mL per well.\nAllow the cells to adhere by incubating them at 27°C in the dark for 30 min to 1 h.\nOnce the cells adhere to the bottom of the 6-well plate, change the medium to Grace’s Unsupplemented Insect Medium using a sterile pipette tip.\nTake two sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and add 100 μL of Sf-900 II SFM medium to each tube. Add 6 μL of transfection reagent to Tube 1 and 1 μg bacmid DNA to Tube 2. Mix the contents within each tube and leave them at room temperature for 30 min.\nTransfer the contents of Tube 1 to Tube 2 and mix well by pipetting up and down. Leave the mixture at room temperature for 30 min.",
    "Add the bacmid: transfection reagent mixture to the cell in the well. Mix gently by shaking the plate. Incubate at 27°C for 5 h.\nReplace the transfection mixture with fresh Sf-900 II medium and culture at 27°C for 4–5 days.\nNote: DNA concentration, Cellfectin® II transfection reagent concentration, and cell density are three key factors determining the efficiency of bacmid transfection. Transfection conditions can thus be optimized by varying these three factors. Based on our experience, we recommend the concentrations of each component as Transfection Component table.\nP1-P3 virus production\nAfter transfection, observe the cells under a microscope every other day. Visible signs of infection usually begin to appear 48 h after transfection.\nNote: Compared to control cells, successfully transfected cells should display the following phenotypic characteristics: 1) the cell number does not increase since transfection or is significantly lower than the number of control cells; 2) cell diameter is notably increased, black spots (granules) can be seen inside the cells and some cells are ruptured; 3) some cells are no longer attached to surface of the well and are instead suspended in medium.\nFour days after transfection, the phenotypic characteristics of infected cells should be obvious.\nNote: During incubation, if the incubator does not have a humidification system, the sides of the six-well plate need to be sealed with tape to prevent evaporation.\nAspirate the cell supernatant with a pipette, transfer it to two 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes or a 15 mL centrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 100 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris and collect supernatant containing clarified first-generation baculovirus (P1 virus) stock.\nSince P1 virus titers are too low for expression of recombinant protein, it should be amplified in two further rounds of infection that would yield P2 and P3 viral stocks, respectively.",
    "Note: The preparation of P2 and P3 viral stocks requires T75 cultures flasks to enable infection of larger cell volumes.\nPrepare healthy Sf9 cells. Add 8 × 106 cells to a T75 cell culture flask and then add the Sf-900 II medium to the final volume of 15 mL.\nNote: The medium should be pre-warmed to 28°C in a thermostatic water bath.\nLay the culture flasks horizontally and place them at 28°C in the dark for more than 20 min.\nAfter the cells are attached to the surface of a T75 culture flask, add 0.4 mL of P1 virus stock to the flask. Lay the flask horizontally and shake it gently to mix evenly.\nIncubate at 28°C in the dark for 72 h and monitor cell behavior under a microscope every other day.\nAfter 72 h of infection, cells appear lysed, and the viral particles are released into the medium. Decant the medium into a 50 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 100 × g and 4°C for 10 min.\nTransfer the clarified supernatant containing the high-titer P2 viral stock to a new centrifuge tube. Store at 4°C in the dark.\nNote: P1 and P2 viral stocks can be stored at 4°C for a long time (more than half a year). If stored at −80°C, repeated freezing and thawing should be avoided. Otherwise, viral titers will be greatly reduced. Long-term storage is generally recommended at −80°C degrees.\nRefer to the operating steps for P2 virus production to prepare P3 virus for large-scale protein expression.",
    "Note: Protein expression levels were tested by inoculating 100 mL of Sf-900 II medium with P2 viral stock at a volume ratio of 30:1 and incubating at 28°C in the dark for 72 h. Quantity and purity of expressed Sr35 were considered to determine whether to culture the P3 virus.\nPrepare 750 mL healthy Sf9 cells at 1.0–1.2 × 106 concentration in a cell culture flask and infect them with P3 virus stock at a volume ratio of 1:30 Incubate at 27°C and 120 rpm for 72 h.\nHarvest infected cells by centrifuging at 3,100 × g and 4°C for 15 min.

Collect the clarified supernatant.\nIncubate the clarified supernatant with Ni-NTA resin at 4°C for 1 h. Before incubation with supernatant, the Ni-NTA resin should be equilibrated with five column volumes of Lysis buffer 2.\nNote: The supernatant with Ni-NTA mixture should rotate slowly and uniformly to prevent resin deposition.",
    "Transfer the mixture of supernatant and Ni-NTA resin onto a column. Allow the supernatant to flow through the column. Wash the column extensively with Lysis buffer 2 and then with Lysis buffer 2 containing 20 mM imidazole. Each wash step should be carried out until no protein can be detected in the eluate when using Bradford reagent.\nEquilibrate the column with 5 column volumes of Lysis buffer 2. Leave 5 mL of the buffer in the column and close the column to prevent the buffer from flowing out. Add 100 μL of PreScission Protease (PP) at a 1:100 concentration (w/w). Mix PP well with beads and incubate about 12 h at 4°C.\nAllow the enzyme digestion system to flow through the Ni-NTA column and wash the column extensively with Lysis buffer 2.\nEluted the Sr35 protein (sumo tag-free) with Lysis buffer 2 that contained 20 mM imidazole.\nNote: After washing away protein impurities, the recombinant SUMO-Sr35 remains bound to the Ni-NTA resin (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nOptional: In this protocol, PP protease was directly added to the Ni-NTA column bed to remove the SUMO tag. This procedure was used not only to avoid repetitive protein concentration steps but also to shorten overall purification time, which also reduces the probability of protein aggregation and denaturation. However, when necessary, the SUMO tag can also be removed after eluting the target protein from the Ni-NTA column.\nAfter SDS-PAGE gel analysis (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E), select the eluate containing Sr35 with better protein purity at higher quantity for further purification.\nTo remove the remaining PP protease, the selected Sr35 sample should undergo a round of purification with GST affinity chromatography. Pass the Sr35 sample through a GST column and collect the eluate containing purified tagless Sr35 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).",
    "Note: The PP protease carries a GST-tag, so purification with GST affinity chromatography results in PP protease bound to glutathione resin, whereas the target protein flows through the column.\nUsing centrifugal filter (MWCO = 50 kDa), pool the purified Sr35, replace the buffer system into SEC buffer 2 (25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT). Concentrate the purified Sr35 to the required volume for SEC.\nNote: According to our experience, Sr35 precipitates at concentrations above 5 mg/mL. Therefore, it is important to regularly measure protein concentration during the concentration process to prevent precipitation. Reducing the time of the concentration process can also reduce precipitation.\nAliquot and dilute the Sr35 sample in a sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes to achieve concentration below 5 mg/mL in each tube. Centrifuge at 7,440 × g and 4°C for 15 min.\nPurification with size-exclusion chromatography (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G). Inject the prepared Sr35 sample via sample loop into a Superdex 200 (10/300 GL) SEC column mounted. Be careful not to disturb precipitated protein during sample injection. Perform the purification at the flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. Collect fractions containing protein peaks and run SDS-PAGE analysis.\nNote: The Superdex 200 (10/300 GL) SEC column should be equilibrated with at least one column volume of SEC buffer 2 previously degassed by sonication.\nPool and concentrate the fractions corresponding to pure and homogeneous Sr35 using a centrifugal filter (MWCO = 50 kDa). The concentrated and purified Sr35 can be stored at −80°C until further use.\nAssembly and purification of Sr35 resistosome\nTiming: 1 day\nMix the purified AvrSr35ΔSP and Sr35 proteins to assemble the Sr35 resistosome in vitro and purify the complex with size-exclusion chromatography according to the following steps.\nAssembly and purification of AvrSr35∆SP-induced Sr35 resistosome",
    "Mix the purified Sr35 and AvrSr35ΔSP at a ∼1:2 molar ratio and add ATP to the final concentration of 1 mM. Incubate at 4°C for 2 h.\nNote: Before ATP can be added, the sodium chloride concentration of the Sr35:AvrSr35ΔSP mixture needs to be adjusted to 150 mM. This same protocol can be used for the assembly of AvrSr35ΔSP_R381A-induced Sr35 resistosome.\nCentrifuge the Sr35: AvrSr35ΔSP mixture at 7,440 × g and 4°C for 15 min. Inject the mixture and purify with size-exclusion chromatography (Superose 6 Increase 10/300GL, GE Healthcare) (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B).

Select fractions corresponding to Sr35 resistosome for cryo-EM experiments.\nPool and concentrate the fractions containing purified Sr35 resistosome to 0.5–3 mg/mL in SEC buffer 1 using centrifugal filter (MWCO = 100 kDa).\nNegative staining electron microscopy\nTiming: about 3 h\nTo check the sample homogeneity, the Sr35 resistosome is stained by uranyl acetate or tungsten phosphate staining solution and observed by electron microscopy (Talos L120C G2). The detailed process of the sample preparation is described below.\nSample preparation of negative staining",
    "Dilute the Sr35 resistosome sample to 0.01–0.05 mg/mL and centrifuge it at 4°C for 15 min.\nNote: Before sample loading, the grid should undergo a glow discharge treatment (30–45 s at 15 mA).\nTransfer 5 μL of sample supernatant onto a 2–4 nm carbon-coated 300-mesh copper grid and let it stand for 1 min.\nAbsorb excess liquid with filter paper.\nNote: The liquid should not be completely blotted to avoid removal of protein from the grid.\nDrop 4–6 μL of uranyl acetate onto the grid and quickly absorb excess liquid. Repeat this step three times.\nDrop 4–6 μL of uranyl acetate onto the grid and let it stand for 1 min.\nAbsorb excess uranyl acetate with filter paper. After natural drying, observe the grid by transmission electron microscope (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2D).\nNote: The parameters of protein concentration and staining time can be adjusted according to protein properties.\nCryo-EM structure determination\nTiming: about 2 weeks total: ∼1 day for step 10; ∼1–2 weeks for step 11\nThe successfully assembled of Sr35 resistosome is prepared for the structure determination by cryo-EM. The following steps describe the process in detail, including frozen-hydrated specimen preparation, screening, data collection and processing.\nGrid sample preparation and screening. Frozen-hydrated specimens of Sr35 resistosome were prepared using a Vitrobot Mark IV plunger (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and screened by cryo-EM. The flow chart is shown as Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]. Detailed steps are described below.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2113-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "Ultracentrifuge the Sr35 resistosome sample at 7,440 × g and 4°C for 10 min in a Micro-Ultracentrifuge (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Transfer the supernatant into sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nDilute the Sr35 resistosome sample to five gradient concentrations, including 3, 2.5, 2, 1.5, 1, and 0.5 mg/mL.\nPipette 5 μL of each protein solution onto a separate freshly glow-discharged grid (QuantiFoil-1.2/1.3-Cu 300 mesh holey carbon grid). Absorb excess solution from the grid with 3–6 s of blotting at 100% humidity and 4°C before plunging the grids into liquid ethane.\nOptional: The grid needs to undergo a glow discharge treatment (30 s at 15 mA) before the specimen is loaded. Glow discharge parameters are based on sample hydrophilicity and the existence of a supporting film. When the hydrophilicity of the sample is low, the time of glow discharge can be extended appropriately, or the power can be increased. Moreover, the user can optimize various grid types and vitrification parameters including blot time, blot force and wait time for specimens as required.\nTransfer the grid into a pre-cooled sample box. Keep in liquid nitrogen until further experiments.\nNote: After grids are plunge-frozen, the grid must be transferred into liquid nitrogen and remain at cryogenic temperatures. Frozen grids can be stored in liquid nitrogen before loading onto the microscope.\nTo assess particle distribution and orientation as well as ice quality, sample grids are tested using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Screening results indicated that the Sr35 resistosomes induced by AvrSr35ΔSP and AvrSr35ΔSP_R381A form intact particles and have a better contrast in holey carbon grid (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nOptional: To obtain protein particles with better contrast on the grid, ice thickness and distribution can be adjusted by varying parameters including blot time, blot force, and waiting time. The adjustment of parameters depends on ice quality.",
