    "1. Cell culture\nCulture human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549, and human monocytic cell line THP-1 in RPMI1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified chamber with 5% CO2.\nCulture MRC-5 human lung fibroblast cells in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution at 37 °C in a humidified chamber with 5% CO2.\n2. Preparation of multicellular tumor spheroids using A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line, MRC5 fibroblasts, and THP-1 monocytes\nNOTE: The multicellular tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic 3D spheroids were prepared using the hanging drop method in a 90 mm cell culture dish. A detailed description of these spheroids' development is given below. All cell culture reagents such as complete medium, PBS, and 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution should be pre-warmed at 37 °C before use unless stated otherwise.\nPreparation of cell suspension\n\t\nGrow A549 and MRC5 adherent cells (5 x 106 cells each) in DMEM complete growth medium (Dulbecco's modified eagle medium [DMEM] + 10% fetal bovine serum [FBS] + 1% penicillin-streptomycin) in T25 flasks at 37 °C in a humidified chamber with 5% CO2.\nFor THP-1 cells, grow the cell suspension (5 x 106 cells) in complete growth medium (RPMI1640 + 10% FBS + 1% penicillin-streptomycin) in T25 flasks. For better growth, place the T25 flasks at 37 °C in a humidified chamber with 5% CO2 in a standing position.\nAfter 3 days, at 80%-85% confluency, wash the A549 and MRC5 cells with calcium- and magnesium-free PBS (phosphate buffer saline) by adding 1 mL of PBS (25-30 °C) in each flask for 1 min and aspirating it.",
    "Harvest the A549 and MRC5 cells from the flask by incubating them with 500 µL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution for 5 min at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Immediately after, add 4 mL of complete growth media to inactivate the trypsin.\nCollect the cell suspension from the T25 flask into a 15 mL tube and pellet it down at 125 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 5 mL of complete growth medium.\nEstablishment of multicellular tumor spheroids\n\tNOTE: All steps of the tumor spheroid formation should be performed inside the biosafety cabinet in order to maintain sterile conditions. The maximum volume of the cell suspension has been standardized as a drop of 25 µL to prepare a droplet such that it will not fall down while inverting the lids.\n\t\nCount A549, MRC5, and THP-1 cell numbers using a cell counter. For each spheroid droplet (25 µL) maintain the following cell numbers: 5,000 A549 cells, 4,000 MRC5 cells, and 1,000 THP-1 cells, following the protocol described by Arora et al.7. Calculate the cell numbers accordingly for a 1 mL volume.\n\t\t​NOTE: Spheroids were initially prepared with three different cell counts per spheroid (i.e., 5000, 8000, and 10,000). Also, different cell ratios of tumor cells/fibroblasts/monocytes (1:1:1, 2:2:1, 4:2:1, 5:2:1, and 5:4:1) were checked. Finally, a successful 3D multicellular spheroid formation was seen with a ratio of 5:4:1 and was used for the study. Fibroblast concentration was increased based on its proportion in the tumor microenvironment, which further enhanced the rigidity of the tumor spheroids. The detailed procedure was reported in a recent publication by Arora et al.7.",
    "Prepare the cell suspension at a ratio of 5 (A549, 2 x 105 cells/mL) to 4 (MRC5, 1.6 x 105 cells/mL) to 1 (THP-1, 5 x 104 cells/mL) and make up the volume to 1 mL with complete DMEM.\nPlace a drop of 25 µL of cell suspension mixture onto the cover of a 90 mm culture dish (approximately 50 drops/90 mm dish).

Adjust the lenses and examine the cells to analyze the cell aggregation and proliferation. Press the Freeze and Save buttons provided on the microscope to capture the image.\nChange the growth media on day 4 by carefully aspirating 20 µL of medium from each droplet and replacing it with a fresh complete growth medium.\n3. Live-dead analysis of tumor spheroids\nOn day 7 and 10, carefully invert the 90 mm dish in the biosafety cabinet and use a 200 µL pipette to collect spheroids from each droplet. Collect five spheroids each in a 1.5 mL tube.\nAdd 500 µL of 1x PBS to the 1.5 mL tube containing spheroids and centrifuge at 125 x g for 5 min.

    "Put 5 µL of 1 µM calcein-AM solution and 5 µL of 2 mg/mL propidium iodide solution on the spheroids. Incubate for 10 min. After completion of the incubation period, wash the spheroids gently with 1x PBS twice.\nPlace the 60 mm dish containing spheroids under the fluorescent inverted microscope, observe, and capture images at 10x magnification by selecting the fluorescence option in the microscope software and selecting the FITC (green fluorescence channel; excitation 490 nm, emission 515 nm) for calcein and Texas red channel (TXR; excitation 535 nm, emission 617 nm).\n\t\nFor acquiring the image, switch on Ctr Adv, which is switch 1, followed by switching on the CPU. Wait for the software system to boot. When booted, place the 60 mm dish carefully on the stage and select the magnification (10x) and fluorescent channels (FITC, TXR). Adjust the lenses and scan for the image.\nTo view the image in the system, select the option Live and view the image. Adjust the intensity of fluorescence for appropriate optimization. Save the image by clicking the Save button.\n\t\t​NOTE: At this stage, spheroids will be visible through the naked eye. Under the light microscope, spheroids will appear as round, rigid spheres at 10x magnification. Multiple spheroids can be collected at once using a 200 µL pipette.\n4. Disintegration and cell suspension of tumor spheroids\nCollect 200 tumor spheroids each on day 7 and 10, using a 1 mL pipette in a 15 mL tube.\n\tNOTE: Before collection, carefully check the shape and form of a single spheroid after transferring it onto a microscopic slide or on a 30 mm dish and observe under the microscope.\nPellet the spheroids by centrifugation at 125 x g for 5 min. Aspirate the supernatant carefully without disturbing the tumor spheroids.",
    "Carefully wash the spheroids with 200 µL of PBS, centrifuge at 125 x g for 5 min, and cautiously discard the supernatant.\nFor the spheroid disintegration, add 400 µL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution and keep at 37 °C for 10 min.

Centrifuge at 125 x g for 5 min and discard the supernatant carefully.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL of complete DMEM medium and count the total number of cells.\n5. Cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) isolation through microbeads\nFor the isolation of CAFs from the tumor spheroids, resuspend 1 x 107 cells in 80 µL of cold magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) buffer (PBS at pH 7.2 containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin [BSA] and 2 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid [EDTA]).\nIncubate the cell suspension (containing 1 x 107 cells) with 20 µL of anti-fibroblast microbeads. Mix well by gently tapping the tube and incubate for 30 min at room temperature.\nWash the cells with 1 mL of cold MACS buffer, centrifuge at 125 x g for 5 min, and aspirate the supernatant. Resuspend the cells in 500 µL of MACS buffer.\nFor magnetic bead-based cell separation, prepare the MACS column by rinsing it with 3 mL of MACS buffer.\nPlace the cell suspension into the column followed by the collection of flow-through containing the unlabeled cell population.\nWash the column three times with 3 mL of MACS buffer. Remove the column from the separator and place it on the collection tube.\nCollect the anti-fibroblast microbead-labeled cells by adding 5 mL of MACS buffer and firmly pushing the plunger into the column.\nCentrifuge the labeled cells at 125 x g for 5 min. Proceed with the isolated fibroblasts for downstream applications.",
