    "Similar to many other primary cell types it is difficult to transfect UDCs with large vectors using regular lipid-based transfection. Here we describe a step-wise feeder-free protocol to reprogram UDCs with ReproRNA-OKSGM using electroporation as an alternative transfection method, hence combining a non-integrating reprogramming vector with a cell source that can be harvested through non-invasive methods. The first section describes the starting material and how to prepare for the electroporation. In the next set of steps the UDCs are harvested and transfected with ReproRNA-OKSGM and subsequently cultured until hiPSC colony picking. The final section describes how to quantify the transfection efficiency by flow cytometry.\nMaterials\nUGCs (see Zhou, Benda, Dunziner, et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.124#cpsc124-bib-0027])\nRenal Epithelial Cell Growth (REGM)-medium (Lonza, cat. no.

    "1. Culture early passage UDCs REGM-medium in one well of a 6-well culture plate until 80%-90% confluent. Before reprogramming make sure that the UDCs are mycoplasma negative by using a standard testing kit.\nIsolation of UDCs according to Zhou, Benda, Dunzinger, et al. (2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.124#cpsc124-bib-0027]).\n2. Refresh UDCs with 1.5 ml transfection (TF) medium 1 h prior to harvesting of the UDCs (step 11) (Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.124#cpsc124-fig-0001]/B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.124#cpsc124-fig-0001]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b51325d0-6cd8-4b8e-8e4f-b23e7b85e04e/cpsc124-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\n(A) Schematic of reprogramming experiment.

Thaw a Matrigel aliquot on ice and dilute with cold DMEM-F12 according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n4. Add 1 ml of the diluted Matrigel into one well of 6-well plate and 0.5 ml into 2 wells of a 12-well plate, respectively.\n5. Incubate for at least 30 min at room temperature (RT).\n6. Remove the Matrigel solution and add 1.5 ml TF medium to each coated well of the 6-well and 0.75 ml to each coated well of the 12-well-plate.\n7. Place in the incubator until further use.\nSetting up of the NEON transfection system\n8. Set up the NEON pipette station according to manufacturer's instructions.\n9. Enter the following transfection parameters manually: 1,200 V, 50 ms, 1 pulse.\nThawing of ReproRNA-OKSGM\n10. Thaw the ReproRNA-OKSGM on ice.\nHarvesting of UDCs for transfection\n11. Wash the UDCs with 2 ml DPBS (RT).\n12. Add 0.5 ml of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA and place in the incubator for 4 min.\nCells should be completely detached after 4 min incubation with Trypsin-EDTA. If still adherent, gently tap the plate to loosen the cells.",
    "13. Add 2 ml REGM medium (RT) to the cell suspension, transfer into a 15-ml conical tube, and centrifuge at for 3 min at 200 × g, RT.\n14. Discard the supernatant and gently resuspend the pellet in 2 ml TF medium.\n15. Take 10 µl of the cell suspension and mix with 10 µl of 0.4% Trypan Blue.\n16. Count the number of live (unstained) UDCs using a cell counter. Refer to the manufacturer's guidelines for instructions.\n17. Take an aliquot corresponding to 2.4 × 105 live cells and centrifuge for 3 min at 200 × g, RT.\nTransfection of UDCs\n18. Carefully remove the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet.\nIt is important to remove as much volume as possible, to minimize the dilution of Resuspension buffer R in the next step.\n19. Resuspend UDCs in 22 µl of resuspension buffer R (Neon Transfection kit).\n20. Transfer 11 µl of the cell suspension into a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube. Keep the remaining cell suspension at RT.\n21. Add 1 µl of ReproRNA-OKSGM directly into the cell suspension and mix well by pipetting gently up and down.\n22. Aspirate 10 µl of the cell suspension/ReproRNA mix from step 21 with the NEON-pipette, avoid air bubbles.\nAny air bubble in the tip causes arcing, which can result in reduced or failed electroporation of the UDCs.\n23. Insert the Neon-pipette vertically in the Neon-tube containing 3 ml Buffer E (Neon Transfection kit) in the Neon Pipette Station (as prepared in step 8).\n24. Electroporate the cells using the parameters of step 9. (Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.124#cpsc124-fig-0001])\n25. Remove the Neon-pipette from the station and transfer the electroporated cells into a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube.",
    "26. Plate 5 µl of the transfected UDCs into the Matrigel-coated 6-well plate and 5 µl into one well of the 12-well plate with prewarmed TF medium from step 7. Distribute the cells by gently rocking the plate.\n27. Plate 5 µl of untransfected cells from step 19 in the remaining well of the 12-well plate. Distribute the cells by gently rocking the plate.\n28. Incubate the cells at 37°C and 5% CO2 without disturbing them for the next 24 hr..\nReprogramming of transfected UDCs\n29. Refresh the cells 24 and 48 hr post-transfection with 1.5 ml REGM-medium with B18R for the 6-well plate and 0.75 ml REGM-medium with B18R for the 12-well plate.\nAttached single cells should be equally distributed throughout the well.\n30. Replace REGM-medium with B18R with 1.5 ml ReproTeSR+B18R at 72 hr post-transfection for the 6-well plate. Refresh cells daily until day 11. For the cells in the 12-well plate, proceed with step 32.\nSmall groups of cells undergoing reprogramming that are surrounded by regular UDCs can be observed from day 7 after transfection (see Fig. 1C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.124#cpsc124-fig-0001]).\n31. From day 12: refresh cells with 2 ml TeSR-E8 daily until hiPSC colonies are ready for picking.\nAt this timepoint wells are often fully confluent with non-reprogrammed UDCs surrounding newly formed hiPSC colonies. This will not compromise the growth of the hiPSC-colonies. However, removal of UDCs around hiPSC colonies by gentle scraping with a pipette tip can accelerate outgrowth of the hiPSC-colony.\nhiPSC colonies are ready for picking and further expansion around day 18-21 post transfection (Fig. 1D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.124#cpsc124-fig-0001]).\nFlow cytometry analysis to quantify UDC transfection with ReproRNA-OKSGM\n32. Wash both wells of the 12-well plate (transfected and untransfected UDCs) with 1 ml DPBS.",
    "33. Add 0.25 ml of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA to each well and incubate for 4 min at 37°C.\nCells should be completely detached after 4 min incubation with Trypsin-EDTA. If still adherent, gently tap the plate to loosen the cells.\n34. Add 1 ml of REGM-medium to each well and transfer the cell suspensions into a 15-ml tube, prelabeled with either + (transfected-) or – (untransfected).\n35. Centrifuge for 3 min at 200 × g, RT.\n36. Remove the supernatant, resuspend the pellet in 200 µl Medium A (FIX and PERM permeabilization kit) and incubate for 15 min at RT.\n37. Add 3 ml FACS buffer and centrifuge the cells for 5 min at 300 × g, RT.\n38. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 100 µl Medium B (FIX and PERM permeabilization kit).\n39. Add 2 µl of conjugated anti-OCT3/4 antibody (1:50) and incubate for 20 min at RT in the dark.\n40. Add 3 ml of FACS buffer and centrifuge for 5 min at 300 × g, RT.\n41. Remove the supernatant and wash the cells with 3 ml FACS buffer. Centrifuge for 5 min at 300 × g, RT.\n42. Resuspend the pellet in 200 µl FACS buffer and filter the cell suspension by using a cell strainer in the lid of a Falcon round-bottom test tube.\n43. Measure the percentage of OCT3/4+ cells with a flow cytometer. Use the untransfected cells as a negative control.\nIf the percentage of OCT3/4+ is below 0.1%, discontinue the reprogramming experiment and repeat the electroporation.",

Remove culture medium from the hiPSC cultures and add 1 ml GCDR; incubate for 7 min at 37°C.\n2. Pipette vigorously up and down several times with a 1000-μl pipette to dislodge the cells and generate a single-cell suspension.\n3.
