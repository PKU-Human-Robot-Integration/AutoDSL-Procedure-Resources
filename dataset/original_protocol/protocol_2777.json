    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPart 1: Stem cell fixation for immunofluorescence\nTiming: ∼30 min\nAs noted above, this protocol will outline the methods used to fix, stain, and visualize mitochondria in MuSCs residing on isolated single myofibers from the EDL muscles of mice; the model system utilized previously.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] Following isolation, EDL myofibers are collected in one well of a 24-well plate. The volumes discussed below are based on this experimental set up. This protocol can be adapted to other cell types that are either abundant or scarce in number.\nOnce EDL myofibers are collected in a well(s) of a 24-well plate, all excess media/buffer should be removed carefully using a pipette to avoid loss of myofibers.\nCritical: Myofibers can be lost in wash steps. Media/buffer should be removed carefully using a pipette. When removing liquid via pipetting, first allow myofibers to settle to the bottom of the well and then gently remove the surrounding buffer while ensuring that myofibers are not disrupted.\nWash myofibers with 1 mL of pre-warmed sterile 1× PBS (37°C).\nRemove 500 μL of the 1× PBS using a pipette.\nAdd an equal volume (i.e., 500 μL) of pre-warmed 4% PFA (37°C) to the remaining 1× PBS from the step above.\nNote: This dilution will lead to the working concentration of 2% PFA, which has been optimized for the visualization and quantification of mitochondrial length and volume in the EDL-MuSC model while minimizing excessive background autofluorescence from the myofiber itself. The working concentration of PFA may differ in other cell-types and preparations. Users must optimize accordingly.\nCritical: Warmed 4% PFA is necessary to reduce the autofluorescence specifically from the EDL myofiber and will lead to improved image resolution.\nIncubate with gentle rocking for 10 min at room temperature.",
    "Wash myofibers 3 × 5 min with 1 mL of 1× PBS.\nPause point: If not staining cells immediately, store myofibers at 4°C in 1× PBS until further use. To prevent evaporation of the PBS, myofibers should be stored in a sealed container (i.e., 1.5 mL tube, or a parafilm sealed plate). Additionally, optimal staining results are observed when myofibers are stained prior to 1 week storage.\nPart 2: Immunofluorescence staining of muscle fibers to assess mitochondrial length and volume in resident muscle stem cells\nTiming: 2 days\nThe goal of this portion of the protocol is to stain the MuSCs and mount the EDL myofibers collected in Part 1. Utilizing a mitochondrial protein marker (i.e., Tom20) and a MuSC marker (i.e., Pax7) allows for visualization of these organelles in the MuSC population ex-vivo. If other cell types are being used, confirmation of cell lineage should be done by staining for a relevant cell-specific marker.\nCritical: The use of Tom20 was optimized and utilized as described previously.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] Tom20 was chosen as a structural mitochondrial protein of the outer mitochondrial membrane that reliably represents mitochondrial morphology. Caution should be taken if using mitochondrial targeted fluorophores, as many are dependent on mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). As such, uptake of the fluorophore and quantification may only reflect mitochondria that maintain their membrane potential. This is especially important as MMP can vary in 1) subpopulations of stem cells,9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10],10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11],11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] and in 2) cycling cells based on the stage within the cell-cycle.12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]\nRemove PBS from the samples collected in Part 1, leaving no more than ∼100 μL.\nIncubate each sample with 1 mL permeabilization solution for 10 min at room temperature with gentle rocking on a plate rocker.\nRemove all but ∼100 μL of permeabilization solution.\nAdd 1 mL of blocking solution per sample.",
    "Incubate for 5 h at room temperature on a plate rocker.\nNote: Less incubation time for blocking may lead to poor quality of mitochondrial images, thus it is advised that at least 5 h of incubation is followed.\nRemove all but ∼100 μL of the blocking solution.\nAdd 100 μL of primary antibody staining solution. See “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]” section for suggested antibody concentrations.\nIncubate on a plate rocker overnight at 4°C.\nWash 3 × 5 min in 1 mL of 1× PBS at room temperature on a plate rocker with gentle rocking.\nAdd 200 μL secondary antibody staining solution. See “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]” section for suggested secondary antibody concentrations.\nIncubate with gentle rocking for 1 h at room temperature.\nNote: Ensure samples are kept in the dark by wrapping in foil or covering with an opaque container.\nAdd 200 μL of diluted DAPI for the final 5 min of this incubation. The working concentration of DAPI should be 1:1500.\nNote: The DAPI is added to the existing secondary antibody staining solution by first generating a dilution from the 2 mg/mL stock DAPI of 1:750 and then adding an equal volume of this dilution (200 μL) to the sample to get a final concentration of 1:1500.\nWash 3 × 5 min in 1 mL of 1× PBS at room temperature on a plate rocker while gently rocking in dark conditions.\nMount cells/fibers using charged glass slides and Mounting Media.\nCreate a circle on a charged glass slide using a Pap Pen.\nRemove the 1× PBS from the sample until about 100–200 μL are left.\nUsing a p1000 pipette, gently pipette the EDL myofibers onto the glass slide.\nAllow 2 min for the EDL myofibers to settle to the slide.\nGently remove the excess 1× PBS using a p200 pipette.",
    "Allow samples to dry, until damp (this normally takes 1–2 min).\nNote: If the PBS dries completely, crystals will begin to form and will interfere with image quality. Thus, it is important to mount the samples in a timely manner.\nAdd a thin line of Mounting Media along the center of a rectangular (24 mm × 50 mm) cover slip.\nGently place coverslip onto to the glass slide and press down to create a seal.\nCritical: If too much mounting media is used and/or the cover slip is placed too aggressively, fibers will be pushed off the glass slide and lost. Ensure careful application of the cover slip.\nAllow slides to dry overnight in the dark at room temperature.\nSlides can subsequently be stored at 4°C in a slide box until ready for imaging.\nPart 3: Generating 3D reconstructed mitochondria and assessing mitochondrial structure in adult muscle stem cells\nTiming: ∼10 min/cell\nImaging and processing were completed on a LSM880 Airyscan Confocal Microscope (Zeiss) at the uOttawa Cell Biology Image Acquisition Core. The airyscan capability allows for enhanced signal-to-noise ratio and obtains high resolution information. Other microscopes and softwares with similar functionality may be sufficient to assess mitochondrial length and volume in these cell populations; however, users must optimize microscope settings and imaging parameters accordingly.\nImage mitochondria in adult MuSCs by confocal microscopy.\nPlace the slide, with a drop of immersion oil onto a 63× oil immersion lens.\nLocate a cell of interest and center it in the field of view.\nNote: For MuSCs on EDL myofibers, Pax7 immunofluorescence is used to locate cells of interest. A cell lineage marker should be used to identify specific cell-types, along with DAPI to confirm the staining of a cell.",
    "Adjust Image settings to optimize laser intensity, pinhole diameter, gain, offset and ensure optimal signal: noise.\nNote: For this protocol, image settings were adjusted and optimized using the Zeiss Zen Black 2.3 software (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2475-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Confocal and z-stack imaging of mitochondria\nScreenshot view of the Zen software control panel with parameters used to image mitochondria. White Box: “Live” Button allows for live viewing of staining in real time. While using this feature, users can set the upper and lower limits of the Z-stack as addressed below. Pink Box: “Continuous” Button allows for live viewing in continuous scanning to adjust for the Airyscan signal. Red Box: “Channels” parameters is used to modify pinhole, channel gain, laser selection, and other imaging parameters for each individual channel. Selecting different tracks allows the visualization and image capture of the selected channel(s). Yellow Box: “Z-Stack” window is used to set the parameters for the upper and lower limits of the cell of interest. Green Box: “Start Experiment” Button is used to capture the Z-stack image once all the parameters for the experimented have been selected. Teal boxes: Outlines the steps to follow to implement the Airyscan processing on the acquired image.\nIn order to create 3D reconstructed images, use the “Z-Stack” capability of the microscope to capture image slices spanning from the upper to the lower limits of the cells (yellow boxes in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).",
    "Note: When setting the upper and lower limits for the Z-stack, ensure that these limits are set to the presence of mitochondria. The purpose of this is two-fold, it ensures that 1) all mitochondria in the cell are being captured and that 2) the stack limits are not overestimated such that it would lead to excessively large files. To do this, the focus knob is rotated in one direction all the way until there are no mitochondria visible and this is set as the upper limit. Then the knob is turned in the opposite direction, again until there are no mitochondria visible, and this is set as the lower limit. This then establishes the upper and lower limits of the Z-stacks.\nNote: At this stage, it is most efficient to scan the upper and lower limits of the cell using only the channel with the mitochondrial stain (Tom20 immunofluorescence).\nNote: Each slice should be at 0.16 μm intervals. Using these settings, it may require anywhere between 20–45 slices to capture all mitochondria within MuSCs residing on EDL myofibers.\nAcquire optimal Airyscan signal. Using the Zeiss Zen Black 2.3 software, ensure Airyscan processing is enabled to acquire images that are of sufficient quality for 3D reconstruction. This can be done by selecting the “Continuous” scanning option while in the Tom20 channel (pink box in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). The Airyscan window will specify a “Good” (in green) or “Bad” (in red) signal. Microscope settings can be adjusted until a “good” signal is reached. If “Good” is present, the user can proceed with imaging. If “Bad” is present, the user can adjust the Z-plane of the cell until “Good” is reached.",
    "Capture the Z-stack with all three channels turned on (DAPI, Pax7, Tom20) (red box in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) by pressing on the “Start Experiment” button in (green box in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nOnce the z-stack is complete, process the image using the Airyscan Processing Window. This is performed by selecting the “Processing” window and clicking on “Airyscan Processing” (blue boxes in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Press “Select” in the “Method Parameters”, which will then preview the captured image following Airyscan. Select “Apply” and wait for the Airyscan feature to complete.\nSave image in the .czi format that retains all the metadata required for subsequent analysis. Proceed with analysis.\nMeasure and quantify mitochondrial length using the FIJI Software.\nOpen image in Fiji.13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14] When prompted with the “Bio-Formats Import Options” window, ensure that “View Stack with” is set to “hyperstack”, and “autoscale” is selected.\nIn the Fiji toolbar select the following: “Image” -> “Stacks” -> “3D Project” to create a 3D projection of the image (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]Ai). When the “3D Projection” window opens, select “Ok” (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]Aii).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2475-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Generation of 3D projection confocal images and quantification of mitochondrial length in Fiji\n(Ai) Once the .czi image file is opened in Fiji, a 3D Projection can be generated by selecting the “Image” tool in the toolbar and “3D Project” in the “Stacks” column.\n(Aii) The “3D Projection” window will appear. The user should ensure the settings are correct and then select “Ok”.\n(Bi) A 3D projection of the z-stack image will appear, revealing the mitochondrial (Tom20) and MuSC (Pax7) staining (inset shows merged view).\n(Bii) To enhance the quality of Tom20 staining (i.e., mitochondria), the brightness/contrast can be adjusted.",
    "(Biii) Application of the “Sharpen” feature will define individual mitochondria for accurate measurements to be made. Dotted box shows zoomed views of mitochondria before and after application of the “sharpen” feature. Scale = 2 μm.\n(C) The “Freehand Line” tool, selected from the Line tool in the toolbar, is used to trace the individual length of a mitochondrion to acquire mitochondrial length measurements. Zoomed view shows examples of mitochondrial tracings (yellow lines) used to acquire length measurements.\nIt may be necessary to adjust the brightness and contrast of the image to better visualize mitochondrial staining (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]Bi). To do this, go to: “Image” > “Adjust” > “Brightness/Contrast” and adjust the histogram of brightness and contrast (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]Bii). Click on “Apply” in the “Brightness/Contrast” window to ensure that these modifications are saved for all Z-stacks. Repeat this for all channels if needed.\nNote: If it is difficult to distinguish individual mitochondria the user can adjust the image using built-in image processing in Fiji. Adjustments include 1) adjusting the brightness and contrast features to resolve mitochondria (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]Bii), 2) sharpening the image (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]Biii), and 3) rotating the image using the toolbar below the image.\nSelect the Line Function in the toolbar (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). Selecting “Freehand” allows for more flexibility when tracing individual mitochondria for subsequent measurement (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nNote: When quantifying mitochondrial length, users can turn off the alternate channels to allow for visualization of all mitochondria within the cell. This can be done by following the path “Image” -> “Color” -> “Channels Tool”.\nDraw a line across an individual mitochondrion and click “M” on the keyboard to measure and record its length. This will be repeated for each mitochondrion in the image. All discernable mitochondria within a cell are to be quantified (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).",
    "Note: Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C depicts a zoomed region of mitochondria within the cell to provide a representative view of mitochondrial measurements. It is important to note that all discernable mitochondria should be measured within a cell to prevent any bias in measurements. As such, data for mitochondrial length, presented as scatter plots (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B, 3F, and 3J), mean mitochondrial length (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C, 3G, and 3K) or percent mitochondrial length distribution (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D, 3H, and 3L) shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] was generated by quantification of all mitochondria within the cell.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2475-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "(B–D, F–H, J–L) Three individual cells were quantified for each condition and the data are presented in three ways. (B, F, and J) Scatter plots of the compiled raw length values of individual mitochondria from three cells; n > 90 mitochondria. (C, G, and K) Bar graphs of mean mitochondrial length within each independent cell; n = 3 cells. (D, H, and L) Graphs of the percentage distribution of mitochondria based on each length binning; n = 3 cells. Data presented as mean ± SEM. ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001 student’s unpaired t-test.\nCalculations and presentation of mitochondrial length measurements can be performed in several ways. The raw individual mitochondrial length measurements can be presented in a scatter plot to showcase value distributions. The average mitochondrial length can also be calculated and presented as a bar graph of “mean mitochondrial length”. Although this method can be informative, subtle differences may be lost when quantifying in this manner. Thus, investigators can also present the data by binning mitochondria based on their length distribution.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] Data in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] demonstrate mitochondrial length in MuSCs under conditions that lead to increased or decreased mitochondrial length by genetic or pharmacological means (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nMeasure mitochondrial volume in Imaris Software (version 9.7.2).\nOpen the image on Imaris.\nTo create a surface rendering of the image, first click on the “add new surfaces” button.\nNote: Leave the settings as is.\nSelect the Tom20 channel to create a surface over mitochondria.\nNote: Do not smooth the image, as this may reduce the resolution of individual mitochondria.\nEnable background subtraction in the thresholding option.",
    "For the background subtraction, the value inputted is equivalent to the smallest diameter of the object for which the surface is being created. In this case, that value would represent the width of a mitochondrion. Measure the width of a single mitochondrion and copy that distance into the surface creator.\nIn the next step, adjust the thresholding on the histogram to create an appropriate surface rendering that is representative of the mitochondrial staining, while at the same time minimizing the background noise effectively.\nNote: Depending on the quality and resolution of the staining, it may be useful to enable the option for “split touching objects”, where it is evident that individual mitochondria are being merged into one surface.\nOnce the surface is generated, adjustments can be made in the number of voxels histogram to remove background or noise.\nNote: If the rendering is not properly detecting all mitochondria, repeat previous steps adjusting the background subtraction and thresholding.\nCritical: Imaris will automate a surface rendering of the inputted image based on the user’s adjustments in previous steps. It is strongly advised that this rendering be validated for accuracy by the investigator. If individual mitochondria are not resolved properly this may lead to an over or under estimation of individual organelle volume.\nOnce the above steps are completed, and the user clicks “Done”, the output measures will be automatically generated.\nTo view values, users should click on “Detailed” in the analysis tab of the software. Values for mitochondrial volume (both individual and total) will appear, amongst other measures.",
    "Critical: If the investigator notices extreme values (i.e., very large or very small), they can be validated as individual mitochondria. To do so, click on the value in question, which will highlight the product in the rendered surface. Upon validation, if these values are not accurate (i.e., they pertain to debris or background staining) they can be excluded and/or the investigator can go back and produce a more appropriate surface of the image.\nPart 4: Preparing primary muscle stem cells for electron microscopy and analysis of mitochondrial ultrastructure\nTiming: ∼1 h for preparation, ∼10 min per cell to visualize and quantify\nBelow is a generalized protocol that is optimized and utilized for assessing mitochondrial ultrastructure via electron microscopy on a small number of primary MuSCs. Although this methodology was utilized on MuSCs, this protocol can be adapted and used for other rare cell populations.\nNote: Our FACS-based protocol for isolating muscle stem cells yields ∼100,000 cells, which is sufficient for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis only when embedded in low-melt agarose.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] However, if the cell yield is less than this number, samples may need to be combined after fixation. See below for details.\nFollowing isolation of cells, pellet cells via centrifugation.\nNote: FACS isolated MuSCs are spun in a 1.5 mL tube at 4,200 rpm for 2 min.\nRemove the supernatant using a pipette, carefully avoiding the cell pellet.\nGently add 1 mL of sterile 1× PBS.\nNote: Be very gentle when adding the PBS so that the pellet is not disturbed.\nCentrifuge at 1,200 rpm for 5 min at room temperature.\nRemove liquid using a pipette and gently add 500 μL of cold EM Fixative.\nNote: Be very gentle when adding the fixative so that the pellet is not disturbed/resuspended.\nIncubate for 15 min at 4°C.",
    "Centrifuge at 5,000 rpm for 8 min.\nRemove liquid using a pipette.\nAdd 500 μL of cold EM Fixative.\nPause point: The cell yield from FACS isolation may be too small to accurately perform the subsequent steps (i.e., under 100,000 cells or no visible pellet). If this issue arises, users can store this pellet in 500 μL of EM Fixative for up to 1 month at 4°C. Cells from subsequent isolations can be combined, as discussed below. In addition, if investigators are not ready to proceed to the next step, pellets can be stored at 4°C.\nCombine cell pellets from multiple sorts if required. To do so, gently resuspend a pellet in one tube, using the EM Fixative buffer within the tube, and add it to the tube containing the second pellet.\nWhether combining pellets or not, spin the sample at 5,000 rpm for 8 min and then remove the supernatant.\nAgarose embed the samples as per the instructions below.\nCritical: Low-melt agarose solidifies at room temperature. To keep in liquid form, leave at 67°C until needed.\nPrewarm pellets to 37°C in a heating block for a few minutes.\nNote: This can be done while the agarose is melting (see instructions above for agarose preparation).\nQuickly add 30 μL of agarose to the cell pellet and gently resuspend.\nNote: It is important to work quickly to ensure that the agarose remains liquid while spinning for the MuSC pellet to be encased.\nSpin at 2,500 rpm for 3 min.\nIncubate the agarose embedded pellet at 4°C for 10 min.\nGently loosen the agarose encased pellet from the side of the tube using a sterile, stainless steel micro-spatula.\nCritical: Proceed with caution. Gently liberate the agarose for the wall of the tube, ensuring that the agarose is not pierced in the process.",
    "Add 500 μL of EM fixative so that the agarose encased pellet is free floating.\nStore at 4°C until needed.\nProcess samples utilizing standard EM-sectioning protocols.\nNote: Agarose-embedded samples for this protocol were processed and sectioned by the Facility for Electron Microscopy Research at McGill University.\nVisualize mitochondria in MuSCs via TEM.\nNote: Electron micrograph images for this protocol were captured at the uOttawa TEM core facility using an JEOL JEM-1400Flash 120 kv transmission electron microscope equipped with a GATAN 4K CMOS OneView digital camera and a Lab6 filament as emission source for enhanced contrast. We recommend first taking an image at lower magnification (i.e., 1500×) to visualize the whole cell of interest (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). Subsequently, investigators should take an image at a high enough magnification (i.e., 20,000×) to capture mitochondria (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2475-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "Measure the length of a mitochondrion using the Freehand Line tool in Fiji (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nCount the number of cristae in the mitochondrion.\nMeasure the width of each cristae using the Freehand Line tool in Fiji (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nNote: To ensure a representative quantification of cristae width, the average of three measurements should be used (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D). One measure should be at the top region of the cristae, another in the middle portion, and finally one at the bottom of the cristae (designated as #1, 2 and 3 in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nMeasure the width of the cristae junction (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nNote: This is the distance between the two edges at the base of a cristae.\nPerform the following calculations:\nCristae # per mitochondria or Cristae # per mitochondrial length.\nCristae width.\nCristae junction width."
