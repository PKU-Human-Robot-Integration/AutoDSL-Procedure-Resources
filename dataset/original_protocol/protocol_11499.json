    "The protocol adheres to the \"Generic Protocol Food Choice Simulator,\" which complies with the Netherlands Code of Conduct for Scientific Practice and has been approved by the Social Sciences Ethics Committee of Wageningen University.\n1. Setting Up the Virtual Store Equipment\nPrepare a sufficiently spacious location for the virtual store display. Prepare all equipment for both the virtual store and the data management program.\n\tNote: The equipment includes two computers (PCs; 1 virtual store PC with a high-capacity memory card for displaying the virtual store, and 1 PC for the data management program), three 42 inch LCD screens, a computer screen for displaying the data management program, connecting cables, electronic sockets, a 3D space navigator, 2 mice, and 2 keyboards.\nConnect all the equipment together, as demonstrated in Figure 1.\nConnect one PC to a computer screen, a keyboard, and a mouse to use the data management program.\nPlace 3 LCD screens next to each other and adjust the left and right screens to give a 180° field-of-view of the virtual store that appears on the screens.\nConnect the virtual store PC with the 3 LCD screens, the 3D space navigator, a mouse, and a keyboard. Connect the virtual store PC with the data management PC.\nTurn both PCs on and adjust the screen resolution of the virtual store PC to \"extend multiple display.\" Set the left screen to be the main display.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55719/55719fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: The virtual store setup. The virtual store uses one PC equipped with three 42 inch LCD screens that render 180° visibility. A separate PC is added to accommodate the data management program. This PC enables a research coordinator to monitor the progress and to start new virtual environments without interrupting participants.

    "2. Building Virtual Stores for Experiments\nOpen the virtual store builder interface (called the editor) by double-clicking on the \"VirtualShop_Editor.exe\" icon on the desktop.\nOpen a store template that is suitable for the study by clicking \"File\" and clicking \"open.\" Select the desired store template, \"Name.ShopConfig\" (e.g., Supermarket001.ShopConfig).\nModify the store regarding the experimental conditions.\n\tNote: Before modifying the store, a plan of the virtual store should be made based on the research questions and objectives of the study. This includes the type, placement, and number of shelves; the location of product categories on these shelves; and the type and location of products within the product categories.\n\t\nReplace existing products with products of interest, where needed.\n\t\t\nUse the right mouse button and move the mouse to zoom in and out to product shelf. And use the left mouse button and move the mouse to change the viewpoint.\nClick on the icons on the left menu bar to change the view of the virtual store (i.e., left yellow face = front view, top yellow face = top view, right yellow face = side view, and all lateral yellow faces = home view (looking from the top-left of the store)).\nDouble-click on a shelf or product and click on the icons on the left menu bar to change the view of this shelf or product.\nDouble-click on a shelf of interest and click on the \"yellow spot\" in the left menu bar to select the isolation mode.\n\t\t\tNote: The isolation mode enables the researcher to isolate a shelf with products and to filter out other objects from the screen. This is helpful when filling the shelfs.\nDouble-click on an existing product and subsequently press the \"Delete\" button on the keyboard to delete this product.",
    "Click on the \"blue arrow\" in the menu bar to open the product library (see Figure 2). Afterwards, click \"Product Category\" and then select the product category of interest (e.g., fruit).\nDrag a selected product (e.g., a tray of apples) by holding the left mouse button and place the product on the desired shelf.\nAdd or replace all the products to match the research interests by repeating the steps from 3.1.1-3.1.4.\nRelocate entire shelves.\nDouble-click a shelf that needs to be relocated. Move the shelf to the desired location by left-clicking the entire shelf and dragging the shelf to a new location.\nRotate the shelf (if necessary) by holding down the \"Ctrl\" key and left-clicking the shelf. Turn or move the shelf to the desired angle by moving the mouse.\nRelocate all necessary shelves to match research interests by repeating steps 2.3.2.1 and 2.3.2.2.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55719/55719fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: The virtual shop editor and examples of products in the product library. The editor has a drag-and-drop interface to allow researchers to easily select products from the library and directly place them on the shelves. In addition, a pop-up window can be used to either add or edit a product by clicking on a product in the library. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=http://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55719/55719fig2large.jpg]\nSave the completed store configuration by using a file name that is non-descriptive of the research condition. Click \"File\" → \"save as\" → \"Name.ShopConfig\" → \"save.\"\n\tNote: It is also possible to build a store from an empty store template. Start by selecting and adding shelves and products from the product library to the empty store. The same procedure from steps 3.1 and 3.2 can be applied.",
    "Build a separate store for a practice session and build more stores according to the experimental conditions, such as supermarkets with different store layouts, following steps from 2.1-2.4.\n\tNote: The example study uses a pharmacy as a practice store.\nAsk the program creator (see the Table of Materials/Reagents for contact details) to create new walking paths and decision points for participants if the store layouts are different than the existing store templates.\n\tNote: Shopping paths and decision points are available for the existing store templates. It is also possible to allow participants to walk freely in the store, without predetermined shopping paths.\n3. Preparing the Data Management Program to Record Data\nDouble-click on the data management program icon on the desktop to start the program.\nOpen the \"Virtual Shop Exp_StartUp\" project to create a new project. Select \"Open\" on the pop up window → \"Virtual Shop Exp_StartUp\" → \"Virtual Shop Exp_StartUp.vop.\"\nClick on \"Set up project\" and select \"Live Observation\" as an observation source. Select \"Continuous Sampling\" as an observation method and select \"Open ended observation\" as an observation duration.\nAdd input variables that represent the experimental conditions (e.g., the store layout and shopping motivation), if desired.\nClick on \"Set up\" in the top menu bar and then click on \"Independent Variable.\" Click on \"Add variable\" to add more user-defined variables.\nFill in necessary details, such as variable name, variable type, predefined value, and so on.\nSave the project by clicking on \"File\" → \"Save as.\" Name the project, \"Name of project.vop\" and click \"Save.\"\n4. Participant Selection Criteria\nRecruit participants without eye disorders, such as color blindness.\n5. Preparation for the Experiment\nPrepare all the documents needed to carry out the experiments.",
    "Invite a participant to the experiment room. Provide a consent form and request that the participant reads and signs the form prior to the study.\nProvide experimental instructions that the participant must follow. See Supplements 1 and 2.\n\tNote: Participants should be informed that visiting a virtual store can lead to virtual reality sickness19, and they should be urged to report it to the study coordinator when they start experiencing symptoms. If a participant expresses that he/she is experiencing virtual reality sickness, participation in the experiment should be stopped.\nSeat the participant in front of the middle LCD screen, at a short distance from the middle screen (~60 cm). Adjust the chair until the participant's eye level matches the position of the screens.\n6. Running a Practice Test\nInform the participant that he/she will be trained in a practice session to control and get familiar with the virtual store. Encourage the participant to ask questions when he/she does not fully understand the instructions.\nOpen the virtual store for a practice session.\nStart the virtual shop program by double-clicking on the VirtualShop_Uviewer icon on the desktop. Click \"Begin\" to enter the store.\nPress the \" ` \" key on the top-left of the keyboard to open the menu bar of the virtual shop program.\nSelect \"SpaceNav\" in an \"Input\" box to choose the type of walking behavior that allows the participants to look and to decide their walking direction freely.\n\t\tNote: \"SpeceNav\" allows participants to look freely through the virtual environment, in any direction, using the 3D space navigator. It also enables participants to decide their own walking direction. Nevertheless, it restricts participants to following predetermined walking lines.",
    "Select the \"Name of a practice store\" in the ShopConfig box and type the \"Name of environment\" to specify the store environment, such as the Practice Store [e.g., Pharmacy 001].\nClick on \"Reload shop\" to open the practice store, and a \"Begin\" box will subsequently appear.\nProvide the mouse, 3D space navigator, and keyboard to the participant. Ensure that the front side of the 3D space navigator faces the participant to enable the correct navigation direction.\nProvide instructions on how to maneuver in the virtual store and instructions for the practice session to the participant. The instruction assigns two practice tasks that request that the participant searches for specific products and selects and/or returns some products.\n\tNote: Examples of instructions on how to maneuver in the virtual store and instructions for the practice session are shown in Supplementary Files 1 and 2, respectively. A practice session should include all tasks that a participant may need to perform during the main test.\nAllow the participant to freely practice until he/she feels familiar with the virtual store. Ensure that the participant understands clearly how to maneuver in the virtual store before starting the main study. Correct or clarify if the participant has made any mistakes.\nRemind the participant to check the shopping cart (by pressing \"F1\") before ending the task. Eventually, remind the participant to end the shopping task by pressing \"Esc\" and then clicking on \"Restart.\"\n\tNote: It is not necessary to close the virtual shop program because it is faster to load the shop for the main test via an opened interface.\n7. Running the Main Test\nMove the participant to another area while the virtual store is prepared for the main test. Inform the participant of the tasks that will follow.",
    "Note: Depending on the research objectives, this can include a task to manipulate an independent factor outside the virtual store (in the extensive example, this is a memory task to manipulate shopping motivation), a shopping task (in the virtual store), and a shopping evaluation task (questionnaire).\nAdminister a task to manipulate an independent variable outside the virtual store when relevant to the study objectives. For example, ask participants to describe in detail a recent shopping situation in which they had either hedonic or utilitarian shopping motivations (see Supplementary File 3).\nPrepare the virtual store for the main study.\nClick on \"Begin\" to enter the store and press the \" ` \" button on the top-left of the keyboard to open the menu bar of the virtual shop program.\nLoad the virtual store and select the virtual environment (walking path), according to the experimental conditions.\nKeep \"SpaceNav\" at the box of the Input to obtain the same type of walking behavior as in the practice session.\nSelect the \"Name of store condition\" in the ShopConfig box and type the \"Name of store environment\" in the environment box, such as \"Supermarket001 [Supermarket001].\"\nClick on \"Reload shop\" to open the store for the main test; the \"Begin\" box will appear.\nOpen the data management program on another computer (in which the data management program is installed). Record the data by double-clicking on the data management program icon on the desktop.\nOpen the project by double-clicking on the \"Name of project.vop\" that the researcher has previously saved when preparing the data management program.\nCreate a new observation by clicking on \"Observe\" in the top menu bar and then clicking on \"Observation\" and \"New.\" Name the observation (e.g., Sample 1) and click \"OK.\"",
    "Start recording by pressing the red circle button and fill in user-defined variables, such as an experimental condition (e.g., store layout = 1 and shopping motivation = 1 (utilitarian motivation)). Click \"OK\".\n\tNote: The recording button will change from a circle shape (record) to a square shape (stop).\nEnsure that the program starts recording data.\nEnsure that the \"Status data plugin\" and \"Status event plugin\" windows show green checkmarks.\nEnsure that \"time\" is elapsing.\nEnsure that the number of \"sample\" column in the \"Status data plugin\" window is growing (shown in Figure 3).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55719/55719fig3.jpg\nFigure 3: An example of the observation window that signals the recording of data. When the data management program is recording data, the \"Status data plugin\" window and the \"Status event plugin\" show a green mark. Also, time should be elapsing and the number of samples should be growing. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=http://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55719/55719fig3large.jpg]\nMove the participant from the area in which they have been provided with instructions and (optional) a task to manipulate an out-of-store variable, such as shopping motivation, back to the virtual store after he/she finishes the manipulation task.\nSeat the participant in front of the middle LCD screen and at a short distance from the middle screen (~60 cm). Adjust the chair until the participant's eye level matches the position of the screens.\nProvide the mouse, 3D space navigator and keyboard to the participant. Ensure that the front side of the 3D space navigator faces the participant to enable the correct navigation direction.\nProvide instructions on how to maneuver in the virtual store (see Supplement 1), shopping task instructions, and a shopping list for the main study (see Supplement 4).",
    "Instruct the participant to press \"begin\" to start visiting the store. Subsequently, leave the participant alone to shop without interruption.\nCheck the data management program on another computer and ensure that the data is recording by checking the \"Status data plugin\" and the \"Status event plugin\"; these windows should show an increasing number of samples and events.\nWait until the participant finishes shopping in the virtual store. Remind the participant to check the shopping cart (by pressing \"F1\") and to press \"Esc\" to complete the shopping task.\n\tNote: It is very important to press \"Esc\" to mark the end of the shopping trip and to obtain a correct measurement of the shopping duration.\nPress the \"stop\" button of the data management program on the other computer to stop recoding (the square button will change back to a circle ).\n\tNote: Two small windows-\"Please wait for receiving Event data to finish\" and \"Please wait for receiving external data to finish\"-will pop up during the termination. These windows will close automatically after 2-3 s.\nAsk the participant to move to another area and ask him/her to fill out a questionnaire measuring, for example, the participant's shopping experiences, perceptions about the store, and willingness to revisit the store.\nReturn to the data management program and click on the \"Visualize\" button to check the recorded data; the graph and data of bought products should be shown, and examples of visualized data are shown in Figure 4.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55719/55719fig4.jpg",
    "Figure 4: The visualization window displayed in the data management program. The orange bar represents the entire shopping time, since the participant entered the store until he/she pressed \"Esc\" to indicate the end of the shopping trip. The green bar denotes the time spent on the examined products. These outputs can be converted into tables that are easy to use in combination with SPSS or other statistical programs.
