Place a diagram with pictures on the table. Ask him to place the finger at the center of the diagram on the word “start”, then place the finger on the drawings.",
    "Ask the patient to sit on the chair with the arms next to his body and the table at a distance equivalent to the length of his forearm. Ask him to place both hands on the table.\nAsk the patient to sit on the chair with both feet on the ground. Ask him to stand up.\nAsk the patient to stand with the upper limbs resting on a piece of equipment for support. Ask him to release the support and stand straight.\nAsk the patient to stand with the upper limbs resting on a piece of equipment for support. Ask him to release the support and raise one foot.\nAsk the patient to stand without support. Ask him to touch the floor with one hand and stand up again.\nAsk the patient to stand and walk 10 steps on his heels.\nAsk the patient to stand without support. Draw a straight line (about 6 m long and 2 cm wide) on the floor, and ask him to walk on the line.\nAsk the patient to stand without support. Ask him to run.\nAsk the patient to stand on one foot without support with the other foot off the ground. Ask him to hop in place.\nAsk the patient to stand without support. Ask him to squat and stand up again.\nCalculate the scores.\n\t\t\nAdd the scores of all 32 items, divide the sum by 96, and multiply it by 100 to calculate the final score.\nTo calculate scores of the subdomains, add the score of all items in that domain and divide it by the maximum score for the domain, then multiply it by 100.\n\t\t\tNote: All scores must be calculated as percentages.\n6-minute walk test (6MWT) \nTask performance",
    "Let the patient rest for 10 min prior to testing. Demonstrate the walking process.\nAsk the patient to stand at the starting line on the right side of the 0 cone. Give the instructions, “Ready, set, go”.\nWhen saying “go”, let the patient start walking around the cones without crossing the middle and, if possible, without slowing down or stopping.\nAt 6 min, stop the timer and let the patient stop walking. Count down the final seconds of the test and mark the point at which the patient stopped.\nCalculation of the scores\n\t\t\nRecord each timepoint at which the patient passes a cone.\nCalculate the total distance by adding a and b, where a is defined as the distance of the final lap (between the last cone rounded until the finishing point at 6 min), and b is defined as the distance in meters prior to the last cone (distance at the time of the last cone rounded).\nTimed 10-meter walk/run test (10MWT) \nTask performance\n\t\t\nAsk the patient to stand at the starting line. Stand at the 12-meter mark and give the instructions, “Ready, set, go”.\nWhen saying “go”, let the patient start walking/running.\nMeasure the time and observe the quality of the walk/run. Stop the timer when the second foot of the patient passes the finish line at 10 m.\nRepeat the test three times, and use the fastest performance to calculate the score.\nCalculation of the scores\n\t\t\nScore the patient on a 6-point scale (1-6) based on the quality of the walk/run during the fastest trial. Score 1 if he is not able to walk by himself, and score 2 if he is not able to walk by himself but is able to walk when supported by a knee-ankle-foot orthosis or another person.",
    "Score 3 if he is not able to increase the walking speed and his gait remains highly adapted and lordotic. Score 4 if he is able to increase the walking speed but not able to run while the gait remains moderately adapted.\nScore 5 if he is almost running but cannot raise his feet from the ground. Score 6 if he is able to run and raise both feet from the ground.\nSupine-up time\nTask performance\n\t\t\nAsk the patient to lie down on the examination table in supine position.\n\t\t\tNote: In the case where a mat is necessary, be sure that it is fixed and not slippery.\nGive the instructions, “Ready, set, go”. When saying “go”, let the patient start standing up as fast as he can.\nMeasure the time and observe the quality of the task. Stop the timer when the patient has assumed an upright position with arms by his side. Provide a chair after the patient has attempted to stand from the floor for 30 seconds.\nRepeat the test three times, and use the fastest performance to calculate the score.\nCalculation of the scores\n\t\t\nScore the patient on a 6-point scale (1-6). Score 1 if he is not able to stand up from supine position. Score 2 if he is able to stand up from supine position when using a furniture for support.\nScore 3 if he turns over in supine position and needs both hands “climbing up” on the legs to reach the standing position. Score 4 if he turns over in supine position and needs one hand on the leg to reach the standing position.",
    "Score 5 if he turns to the side and uses one or both hands on the ground but not on the leg to reach the standing position. Score 6 if he is able to stand up without turning over or using the hands on the legs.\n2. Quantitative Muscle MRI\nPerform axial MRI of the thighs including all muscles (flexors, extensor, and adductors) on a 3 Tesla scanner using a 36-channel peripheral angio and spine coil. Perform localizers and slice positioning as previously described11,17.\nUse a three-dimensional (3D) gradient echo sequence with two different echo times for in-phase and opposed-phase imaging [30 slices, repetition time (TR) = 20 ms, echo time 1 (TE1) = 2.45 ms, echo time (TE2) = 3.68 ms, flip angle = 15, acquisition time = 2 min 49 s] and a multi-contrast spin echo with 14 echo times to quantify the transverse relaxation times. Use a field of view of 400 x 400 mm and 384 x 384 matrix to achieve 1 mm in-plane resolution and 3 mm slice thickness.\nManually draw regions of interest (ROI) on the MR images containing the whole muscle area of flexors, extensors, and adductors of each leg.\nUse the two-point Dixon method and generate relative fat content maps using the pixelwise fat fraction, given f/(f + w), where f = fat images, w = water images17.\nCalculate the T2-relaxation time and mean fat fraction for each muscle group.\nSubscription Required.
