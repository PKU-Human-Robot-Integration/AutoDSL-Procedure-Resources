It involves making the coverslip surface adhesive so that the isolated testes can stick on it, which is essential for long-term time-lapse imaging with minimal movement of the testis.\nGently wipe the surface of the coverslip with lint-free tissue paper, and place the dish on clean tissue paper.\nAdd 50–80 μL poly-L-Lysine in the cavity, and leave undisturbed for 15–20 min.\nCritical: During the Poly-L-Lysine incubation period (Step 2), set the imaging parameters and dissect the testes (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]) as detailed in the following sections. Once the testes are dissected and the incubation period is over, proceed with step 3.\nRemove the poly-L-Lysine using a micropipette and give three quick washes using approximately 50 μL 1× PBS per wash to remove residual poly-L-Lysine, as it may affect the viability of the testis.\nAdd fresh 1× PBS (80–100 μL) in the cavity, which will serve as the live imaging medium. Alternatively, if applicable, add the working solution containing the drug instead.\nCritical: The working solutions of the drugs are to be prepared in 1× PBS. We found significant effects of DMSO on sperm release and actin cap dynamics at more than 0.8% concentrations. Therefore, one must take care to dilute the stock solutions by at least 100-folds for preparing the working solution. Always use freshly prepared working solutions.\nThe effective inhibitory concentrations used are: Rockout - 200 μM; SMIFH2- 25 μM; Latrunculin A- 5 μM , Latrunculin B- 10 μM; Cytochalasin D - 2.5 μM and 20 μM; Jasplakinolide - 50 μM; Colchicine - 10 μM; Taxol - 10 μM; and CK-666 - 250 μM.",

Testis dissection from adult Drosophila, related to step 9 of the main protocol\nSetting the imaging parameters on the confocal microscope\nTiming: 5 min\nThis section describes the imaging settings on the confocal microscope. The system should be switched on and parameters set before the sample is prepared to begin imaging immediately after preparing the samples.\nSet the light path for the relevant fluorophores according to the excitation and emission bands, set the frame size to 512×512 pixels, and make imaging mode simultaneous to increase the time-resolution, unless there is bleed-through between the specific fluorophores used. For example, the typical setting for the GFP would be – laser line 488 nm for excitation, dichroic FT 500 nm, and emission band 500–520. For combined imaging with GFP and dsRed labels, one could use lasers 488 nm and 560 nm for simultaneous excitation, a double dichroic FT 500/20 and 570/10 with the emission bands 500–520 nm and 570–590 nm.\nDepending on the type of experiment, set the required modalities- For example, for Multi-Area Time-Lapse imaging (MATL), initialize the stage; for laser ablation or Fluorescence-Recovery-After-Photobleaching (FRAP), activate the relevant modules.\nDissection of Drosophila testis\nTiming: 5 min\nThe following steps describe methods for testis dissection and placement of the dissected tissue onto the dish.\nFill the dissection cavity with 1× PBS.\nAnesthetize Drosophila males of relevant genotype using carbon dioxide or on a cold plate and transfer them onto the dissection cavity, using forceps. Do not pinch the posterior half of the body during this step. Place the dissection cavity under a stereoscope.",
    "Note: Since the testes are nearly translucent, placing a piece of black paper under the dissection cavity and adjusting the light source orthogonal to the viewing angle helps to see them with good contrast.\nCritical: Make sure to wipe the forceps with lint-free tissue paper soaked with distilled water before and after every experiment to wipe off any residues or drug solutions.\nDissect out the testes from each fly as shown in the Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]\nSnip the abdomen using a pair of fine forceps (Dumont #55), as shown in the Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2].\nDisengage the pair of testes from the gut and cuticle as shown in Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]. Remove the rest of the body and wipe off on tissue paper.\nGently remove the accessory glands and separate the testes from one another by pinching the connection between them.\nCritical: Care must be taken not to damage the testis or pinch it during the dissection, as demonstrated in Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2].\nPlacement of testis on live imaging dish\nTiming: 5–10 min\nGently pick up the dissected testes using a pair of forceps and place them on the surface of the coverslip of the petri dish containing the imaging medium (1× PBS or 1× PBS+drug, as applicable) (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nUsing the forceps, gently adjust the inherent coiled shape of the testes, and ensure that it sticks to the poly-L-lysine coated surface. To monitor the coiling stages, actin cap dynamics or the sperm release, the coiled base of the testis should be placed flat against the surface of the coverslip. Make sure the seminal vesicle does not come in between the testicular base and the coverslip (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).",
    "Critical: Do not forcibly push the testis down or stretch the base against the coverslip surface to flatten it. This can perturb the sperm bundle organization and affect actin dynamics and sperm release events.\nPlace multiple testes in a similar manner close to each other.\nSoak a sheet of Whatman filter paper with PBS and place it at the side of the dish to maintain humidity in the chamber (Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\nSeal the dish using Parafilm™ and place it on the microscope stage. In the case of drug treatments, make sure to start imaging immediately (Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S3. Mounting dissected testis on Poly-L-lysine coated coverslip, related to steps 10–12 of the main protocol\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S4. Preparation of the Petri dish for imaging, related to steps 13 and 14 of the main protocol\nImaging the sample\nTiming: [variable]\nIdentify the suitable samples using bright-field or DIC optics, which are appropriately mounted and appear intact, using a 10× objective (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nSwitch to the relevant higher objective according to the experimental requirement.\nFor documenting individualization and coiling events, use 10×, NA 0.5 or higher.\nFor high-resolution analysis of individualization, use 40×, NA 1.3 or higher.\nFor documenting sperm release events, use 20×, NA 0.7 or higher\nFor actin cap dynamics and laser ablation, use 60×, NA 1.4.\nFor Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP), use 100×, NA 1.4.",
    "Using the wide-field epi-illumination for a quick scan of the specimen before starting the confocal imaging and locate the general region of interest (ROI) position within the testis. For example, to study actin cap dynamics or nuclei bundle (NB) morphogenesis, identify an NB that is closest to the objective and placed flat along the imaging plane as shown in Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C.\nSwitch to the confocal mode of imaging and set the rest of the imaging parameters as detailed below\nSet digital zoom at 3× for all high magnification imaging, and as appropriate for low magnification imaging, to fully capture the relevant ROI. Please note that the NBs move considerably during long-term imaging; hence, set the frame size accordingly to accommodate a sufficiently wide area to catch the entire morphogenesis. It can be achieved by applying an appropriate digital zoom or by changing the magnification of the objective.\nSet the z-slice thickness at 0.5 Nyquist and the depth (number of z-steps) with a sufficient buffer of extra digital slices to capture the moving NBs. This judgement is especially critical for high-magnification imaging as NB can move and change orientation.\nSet the scan speed to 4 μ seconds/pixel or less, and adjust the frame iterations/time-resolution as per the experimental requirement. For example, to monitor the actin dynamics of the caplets, one would require a shorter time interval, whereas to monitor the gross morphological changes, such as cyst movement or NB morphogenesis for a period of a few hours, a more significant time gap would help to minimize photodamage (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] for details).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1296_1.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1296_2.csv\nMaintain the laser power between 20–50 μ Watts, the detector HV to 550–620 and detector Gain between 1 and 1.5, respectively, for confocal imaging.",
    "For wide-field imaging, use an LED-based illumination system or Mercury-Halide illumination with a light guide.\nNote: The detector settings are applicable for a 1.4 NA objective. The sperm release and coiling are highly sensitive to light and one should maintain minimum possible laser power and optimize the time interval as indicated in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] below. The conditions for the FRAP and Laser ablation are indicated in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]. For experiments that do not require free-run imaging (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]), multiple samples can be imaged together using the multi-position module (MATL) for simultaneous xyzt image acquisition from multiple testis specimens."
