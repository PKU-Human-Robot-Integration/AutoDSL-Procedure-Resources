    "Studies performed on rodents followed the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. For this study, myocytes were isolated from 3-34-month-old Sprague-Dawley and F344BN rats weighing ≥ 200 g5. Both male and female rates were used.\n1. Myocyte pacing for contractile function studies\nMake fresh M199-based media for each set of isolated myocytes (Table of Materials). 1 day before pacing, plate 2 x 104 Ca2+-tolerant, rod-shaped myocytes on 22 mm2 laminin-coated glass coverslips (CSs), as described earlier8.\nTo prepare the chambers, soak each chamber in 10% bleach for 1 h. Then, flush the chambers with running tap water for 30-45 min, followed by distilled water replaced every 5 min for 30 min, followed by deionized water replaced every 5 min for 30 min, and a final rinse in deionized water.\nDry the chambers on a clean surface for 20-30 min (Supplemental Figure 1A-C). Next, UV treat the chambers in a biosafety cabinet for 5 min in each direction (total = 20 min). This step is not needed for pre-sterilized chambers.\n\tCAUTION: Leave the area to minimize UV exposure.\nRemove the cover from the chamber, add 3 mL of M199-based media (see Table of Materials) to each well (Supplemental Figure 1B), replace the cover, and preheat the chamber in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 and 20% O2.\nSterilize forceps in a hot bead sterilizer at 250 °C for 20-25 s. Transfer the preheated stimulation chamber from the incubator to a biosafety cabinet.",
    "Transfer each coverslip (CS) containing cardiac myocytes to individual wells in the stimulation chamber using sterile forceps. Transfer CSs four at a time, followed by heating for 10 min prior to the transfer of the remaining four CSs to maintain the media temperature.\nAttach banana jacks to the stimulation chamber on one end (Supplemental Figure 1C) and to the stimulator on the other end (Supplemental Figure 1D).\nSet the stimulator frequency to 0.2 Hz and set the voltage (~12 V) to achieve contraction in ~10%-20% of all the rod-shaped cardiac myocytes within a well. To determine the number of contracting myocytes, place the chamber under an inverted microscope with 4x to 10x magnification.\nPlace the stimulation chamber in an incubator at 37 °C in 5% CO2 (Supplemental Figure 1E). Change the media every 12 h using media preheated in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 20-25 min. Continue electrical stimulation for up to 3 days with the media changed every 12 h.\n2. Contractile function analysis of adult rat cardiac myocytes\nPreheat a gel pack and media in a 37 °C incubator for 30 min prior to the experiment.\nTurn on the contractile function platform components listed in the Table of Materials and shown in Supplemental Figure 2, with special attention to the key components, which include an anti-vibration table (Supplemental Figure 2A-1) with an inverted microscope with a deep red (590 nm) filter (Supplemental Figure 2A-2,3) and CCD camera (Supplemental Figure 2A-4) connected to a CCD controller (Supplemental Figure 2A-5 and Supplemental Figure 2C-5) and integrated with a PC computer (Supplemental Figure 2B-14).",
    "Assemble tubing into the peristaltic pump (Supplemental Figure 2A-8; Supplemental Figure 2A-8), transfer the preheated gel pack into the tube holder (Supplemental Figure 2A-9), and turn on the vacuum (Supplemental Figure 2A-11) and power to the cell stimulator (Supplemental Figure 2B-13).\nPlace a 50 mL tube with media in the insulated tube holder (Supplemental Figure 2A-9) and begin perfusion at ~0.5 mL/min through the peristaltic pump tubing (Supplemental Figure 2E-8).\nAdd a small amount of preheated media to a small weigh boat (~2 mL). Transfer one CS containing myocytes from the stimulation chamber to the weigh boat. Return the stimulation chamber to 37 °C in the 5% CO2 incubator.\nRemove the CS from the weigh boat and gently wipe the underside. Transfer the CS to a freshly greased CS chamber (Supplemental Figure 2A,F-10; black arrow) and gently add a drop of media (~200 μL) onto the CS.\nPlace a platinum electrode mount over the CS (Supplemental Figure 2F; gray arrow) and lay a new CS over the top using forceps. Place a top mount (Supplemental Figure 2F; white arrow) over the CS sandwich and then install two or four #0 pan-head screws to finish assembling the chamber.\nOnce the media is present throughout the pump tubing, attach the tubing to the preheater, and then connect the preheater to the CS chamber assembled in step 2.7. Begin perfusion at 0.5 mL/min and place a tissue wipe below the chamber to make sure there are no leaks.",
    "Place the CS chamber in the stage adapter. The perfused media is collected at the opposite end of the chamber with tubing connected to a vacuum system. Turn on the heating system (Supplemental Figure 2A,D-7) and equilibrate the chamber, objective, and preheater for ~5-10 min to achieve a constant media temperature of 37 °C. Visualize myocytes with the 40x water immersion objective on the microscope during this equilibration time.\nActivate the pacing stimulator (Supplemental Figure 2B-13) by setting the voltage to 1.5x the setting needed for 80% of rod-shaped cells to contract, which is typically 35-40 V. Set the stimulation frequency to 0.2 Hz to optimize contractile function and myocyte survival.\nCollect contractile shortening and re-lengthening traces from continuously perfused and paced myocytes. To collect shortening measurements, use a CCD camera (Supplemental Figure 2A-4) connected to a CCD controller (Supplemental Figure 2B-5,C) and a dedicated computer with an I/O controller board (Supplemental Figure 2B-14; see Table of Materials). The platform measures sarcomere shortening in rat myocytes, although similar results are obtained from myocyte measurements collected from the longitudinal edges of myocytes (see Ecklerle et al.14).\nTo collect sarcomere shortening traces, open the software on the computer, select OK, and then File > New. Prepare a screen template by selecting Traces > Edit User Limits > Sarcomere Length and then setting maximum and minimum values, which are typically between 2.0 μm and 1.5 μm. Calibrate the CCD camerawith a 0.01 mm graticule prior to making measurements in the myocytes (Figure 1D).\nTo record sarcomere length traces, select File > New. Identify a contracting myocyte and position the myocyte along the longitudinal axis of the camera so the striation pattern is vertical (Figure 1B).",
    "Use the computer mouse to place the region of interest (ROI) box (pink box) over the myocyte (Figure 1C). Select Collect and Start to record contractile function. Record shortening for 60 s from each myocyte at low stimulation frequencies (≤0.5 Hz).\nRecord sarcomere shortening from 5-10 cells per CS. Perform measurements at 1 cell/CS if studies include treatment with agonists/antagonists. Prepare separate pre-warmed media and a different, dedicated piece of perfusion tubing loaded in a multi-channel peristaltic pump and follow steps 2.9.-2.14. to measure the impact of drug or neurohormone delivery on myocyte contractile function.\nTo measure shortening over a range of frequencies, pace myocytes at each frequency to obtain steady-state shortening prior to recording5. For these studies, double the perfusion rate and begin recording 15-20 s after stimulation at a new frequency to obtain consistent steady-state contractile responses for frequencies in the range of 0.2 Hz and 2 Hz. Typically, record no more than 2 myocytes/CS for shortening across the given range of stimulation frequencies.\nRecord at least 7 contractions/cell to obtain reliable signal-averaged data when analyzing the recordings (see step 3.).\n3. Data analysis of contractile function in isolated myocytes\nTo begin, select File, choose a recorded trace, and then select Open. Select Tab 1 (left side) of the base trace and then set the yellow panel at the top of the trace to Sarc-Length. Select Traces and the screen template prepared in step 2.12.",
    "To prepare an analysis template, select Operations, Monotonic Transient Analysis Options, TTL Event Mark in the Definition of t0 box, as well as the following options from the menu: Baseline (resting sarcomere length), Departure velocity relative to t0 (dep v), Peak (peak height and %peak height/baseline or bl%peak h), Return velocity relative to tPeak (ret v), Time to Peak 50% (TTP50%) using t0, and Time to Baseline 50% (TTR50%) using tPeak. Save these analysis options by selecting Templates > Save Analysis Template with an identifier. Load this analysis template prior to analyzing each trace.\nTo begin data analysis, select Marks > Gate > Add Transient > Convert from Event Mark > Analysis Range. Now set the time range from -0.01 s to 1.20 s for myocytes paced at 0.2 Hz (Figure 2A, red marks on the lower portion of the raw trace). Select a shorter time range for myocytes stimulated at higher frequencies.\nProduce a signal-averaged trace by selecting Operations > Average Events. A signal-averaged recording appears below the original base trace.\nSelect Tab 1 of the signal-averaged trace (left side of the screen), and then select Marks on the upper menu, followed by Add Transient. Select Operations from the top menu and Monotonic Transient Analysis to display the signal-averaged values for baseline sarcomere length, peak height, bl%peak h, dep v, ret v, TTP50%, and TTR50% in the signal-averaged display panel.\nTransfer each sarcomere transient analysis to a spreadsheet for the composite analysis of multiple myocytes by selecting Export > Monotonic Transient Analysis > Clipboard Current. Paste this data into the spreadsheet for each trace.",
    "To copy the signal-averaged trace, select Export > Current Trace > Clipboard > Options and set the decimal places to 5, then select Tabs Delimiter, and click OK, and OK. Paste the signal-averaged traces for each myocyte recording into a second spreadsheet.\n4. Recording Ca2+ transients in rat adult cardiac myocytes\nPrior to measuring Ca2+ transients, turn on the platform components described in step 2.2., along with additional fluorescence imaging components (see additional components for Ca2+ imaging analysis in the Table of Materials; Supplemental Figure 2A-5,6; 2B-12).\nPrepare Fura-2AM stock solution containing 1 mM Fura-2AM plus 0.5 M probenecid in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Probenecid minimizes Fura-2AM leakage15.\nDilute the stock solution to 5 μM Fura-2AM and 2.5 mM probenecid in 2.5 mL of media (see Table of Materials) in one well of a 6-well plate. Add 2.5 mL media alone (no Fura-2AM) to three additional wells in the plate, cover the plate with aluminum foil, and preheat the media to 37 °C.\nTransfer a CS containing myocytes from the pacing chamber to the well containing Fura-2AM, cover, and return the plate to the 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 for 4 min. Mount tubing in the perfusion pump and perfuse with media during the Fura-2AM loading period, as described in step 2.4.\nTurn off or minimize room lights to reduce fluorescence photobleaching and to optimize the fluorescence signal. Remove the 6-well plate from the incubator, and then wash the CS for 10 s in each of the three wells containing media alone. Transfer the CS to a small weigh boat containing prewarmed media (no added Fura-2AM).",
    "Mount the CS to freshly greased CS chamber after gently wiping the underside of the CS. Gently add a drop of media to the CS, and then assemble the electrode mount over the CS, followed by a second CS and the top mount. Use #0 pan-head screws to finish assembling the cell chamber, as described in steps 2.6.-2.7.\nConnect the pump tubing filled with media to the preheater, connect the preheater to the CS chamber, and place in a stage adapter, as described in step 2.8. Collect the media with the vacuum tubing system and turn on the heating system (Supplemental Figure 2A,D-7) to equilibrate the chamber to 37°C, as described in steps 2.8.-2.9.\nActivate the pacing stimulator (Supplemental Figure 2B-13) set to 35-40 V and 0.2 Hz, as described in step 2.10.\nPrior to recording a Ca2+ transient, turn on a small flashlight or booklight mounted near the computer keyboard to help see the keyboard. In addition, record the fluorescence background in an area without cardiac myocytes. To start, select File > Start > New, as described in step 2.12.\nSelect a ROI, and set one tab (or trace bar, left side) for raw numerator and a second tab for raw denominator, defined in the upper-center of each tab. Record the background for 10-20 s. Right-click the mouse and drag over one trace bar panel to obtain the raw signal-averaged numerator and denominator values. Enter these values by selecting the Operations > Constants, and enter the raw values.",
    "Prepare a new screen template to collect both shortening and Ca2+ transients. For sarcomere length, select Tab 1 and use the same process as described in step 2.13. For Ca2+ imaging, select Tab 2 > Ratio (upper-center of tab) > Traces > Edit User Limits to set the minimum and maximum levels for the ratio, which are typically set between 1 and 5. Use the same process to define the numerator and denominator ranges for tabs 3 and 4 (left side).\nPosition a ROI box over a myocyte image, as described in step 2.14. Select File > New > Collect. Now select Start to collect shortening and ratiometric Ca2+ data. Record ≥7 contractions/cell for signal-averaged analysis.\nRepeat the background trace recording described in step 4.10. after recording 2-4 myocytes. Typically, record 4-5 myocytes/CS or fewer myocytes if there are significant changes in the background reading.\n5. Data analysis of Ca2+ transients in isolated myocytes.\nOpen the desired file for analysis and select Templates > Screen Template for shortening plus Ca2+ transients. Next, select tabs 1 and 2 (left) to show sarcomere length and Ca2+ ratio, respectively. Select Operations > Constants and enter the numerator and denominator values from the Ca2+ background trace.\nPrepare analysis templates for shortening plus Ca2+ transient data. Select tab 1 (left side) and use the same process as described in step 3.2. to set the sarcomere length analysis template.",
    "Select tab 2 (left side), and select Operations, Monotonic Transient Analysis Options, TTL event mark in the Definition of t0 box, and the following options from the menu: Baseline (basal ratio), Departure velocity relative to t0 (dep v), Peak (peak height and %peak height/baseline or bl%peak h), Decay velocity relative to tPeak (ret v), Time to Peak 50% (TTP50%) using t0, and Time to Baseline 50% (TTR50%) using tPeak. Save these analysis options by selecting Templates and Save Analysis Template using a new identifier name. Load this analysis template prior to analyzing each trace.\nUse the same process as described in steps 3.3.-3.6. to average the signal and then analyze sarcomere length, followed by the same steps for Ca2+ transients. Set separate marks for sarcomere length and for the Ca2+ transient ratio trace.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
