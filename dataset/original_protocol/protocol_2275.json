Flow cell assembly process\n(A) A flow cell consists of a top coverslip with two holes of 1–1.5 mm diameter, approximately 40 mm from each other, a double layer of parafilm (∼200 μm thickness) with cut-out channel in the center, and a bottom coverslip. The total volume of the flow cell channel corresponds to ∼70 μL.\n(B) Representation of flow cell assembly by melting the double-layer of parafilm between the top and bottom coverslips.\n(C) Assembly of the flow cell in an MT flow cell holder. The technical drawings of the MT flow cell holder parts are available at https://doi.org/10.4121/19145426[href=https://doi.org/10.4121/19145426].\nCut a double-layer of parafilm with a scalpel to the desired channel dimensions (here, 5 mm wide and 40 mm long; see also Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A.\nClean a (top) coverslip with holes (obtained at step 1) and a (bottom) coverslip without holes by sonicating them for 25 min in 4% (v/v) Hellmanex III in MilliQ water at 40°C in a coplin staining jar.\nWash the coverslips multiple times with MilliQ water.\nSonicate the coverslips for 25 min in MilliQ water at 20°C.\nSonicate the coverslips for 25 min in Ethanol (e.g., pro analysis grade).\nDry the coverslips with a nitrogen stream.\nApply oxygen plasma to both coverslips (20 s, oxygen flow: 2.5 SCFH; 200 W).\nAssemble the flow cell by melting the double-layer of parafilm between the top and the bottom coverslip on a hot plate (95°C for 30 s; see also Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).",
    "Note: It is recommended to prepare multiple coverslips for higher throughput or in case of leakage/breaking of flow cells.\nFlow cell assembly\nTiming: 30 min\nThe flow cell holder ensures proper attachment to the magnetic tweezers, minimizing potential vibrational influence and mechanical drift to measurement accuracy. Additionally, it adds practical inlet and outlet connections to the flow cell.\nAssemble the flow cell in a flow cell holder (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nAttach the flow cell to the magnetic tweezers instrument and attach the outlet to a tube that is connected to a peristaltic pump (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nNote: Any pump type (e.g., peristaltic, syringe) can be used as long as speeds as low as ∼200 μL/min can be achieved.\nFlow 300 μL PBS buffer though the flow cell by pipetting the solution directly into the inlet (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C) during pumping and assure full wetting (complete side-to-side covering of the channel with buffer within the flow cell).\nNote: Throughout the protocol it is important to have all buffers at least at 20°C and use low flow rates (e.g., ∼200 μL/min) to minimize the formation of air bubbles in the flow cell. Additionally, prior degassing of the buffers can be beneficial.\nPerform a leakage test by closing the valve to the pump, filling the inlet with buffer, and observing the reduction in volume at the inlet for ∼15 min. A large reduction in volume indicates leakage.\nNote: Evaporation will also reduce the volume, but only marginally over time. If leakage is apparent, it might be resolved using one of the presented solutions (Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]; Problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]: the flow cell).\nAttachment of reference beads to flow cell surface\nTiming: 15 min\nReference bead attachment to the surface provides a reference point for displacement of the magnetic beads relative to the surface.",
    "Flow 100 μL of polystyrene beads (stock concentration of 1.35 × 1010 beads/mL) diluted 1,500 times in PBS into the flow cell (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]: step 1).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1881-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Schematic of the MT and step-wise functionalization of the flow cell surface\n(Left) General overview of the MT setup: light originating from an LED travels through the gap between the magnets, illuminates the flow cell, and is captured by the objective. The images are reflected to and recorded by a CMOS camera and analyzed with custom-written software to determine the x, y and z positions of the magnetic beads in real time (Cnossen et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). The outlet of the flow cell holder is connected to a suction pump. (Right) The steps involved in coating the flow cell surface and tethering the RNA construct: (1) Reference beads are attached to the surface. (2) Anti-DIG antibodies are attached to the surface, serving as an anchor for the RNA construct. (3) Passivation of the glass surface using the poloxamer Pluronics F127 to suppress unspecific adhesion of biomolecules and magnetic beads. The antibodies and reference beads protrude through the surface coating. (4) The RNA construct is anchored to the flow cell via anti-DIG:DIG linkage. (5) A streptavidin-coated magnetic bead is attached to the RNA construct through the strong biotin:streptavidin interaction. Drawings are not to scale.\nIncubate solution until 5–8 beads per field of view are adhered to the surface.\nFlush all non-adhered beads out using 1–2 mL PBS buffer.\nAttaching digoxigenin antibodies to the flow cell surface\nTiming: 70 min\nThe digoxigenin antibodies provide the RNA construct an anchor point on the surface.\nFlush 100 μL of 0.1 mg/mL anti-DIG IgG in PBS into the flow cell and incubate for 1 h (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]: step 2).",
    "Flush out non-adhered, residual anti-DIG IgG using 500 μL PBS buffer.\nSurface passivation with BSA and F127\nTiming: 170 min\nSurface passivation ensures that non-specific adhesion of proteins, RNA, or magnetic beads is reduced to a minimum.\nFlush though the flow cell 500 μL of PBS supplemented with 10 mg/mL BSA (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]: step 3).\nIncubate for 2 h.\nFlush though the flow cell 500 μL BSA buffer.\nFlush though the flow cell 500 μL of PBS supplemented with 0.5% F127.\nIncubate for 30 min.\nFlush though the flow cell 500 μL PBS.\nWashing of magnetic beads\nTiming: 10 min\nWashing the magnetic beads in passivation buffer ensures that non-specific adhesion of magnetic beads to the surface is reduced to a minimum. Furthermore, it allows for a buffer exchange from the manufacturer’s storage buffer.\nNote: The washing of the magnetic beads can be performed in parallel to the surface passivation. We advise to perform the steps 25–27. during the incubation of 0.5% F127 in the flow cell (step 23).\nAdd 3.0 μL of M280 magnetic beads to 100 μL of passivation buffer.\nMix the solution, then separate the magnetic beads from the liquid using a magnetic stand and discard the supernatant.\nRepeat previous step 2 more times with fresh passivation buffer. Afterwards, resuspend the magnetic beads in 100 μL preparation buffer.\nRNA tethering between surface and magnetic beads\nTiming: 35 min\nRNA and magnetic bead tethering are crucial for setting up the MT assay.\nInject 100 μL of 2 pM RNA construct in preparation buffer into the flow cell (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]: step 4).\nNote: For the conversion of RNA concentration from ng/μL to M, the following formula can be used:",
    "R N A   (  m o l e s  )  =    m  d s R N A     ( g )    (   (   l  d s R N A    (  b p  )  ∗   641  g  m o l     b p    )  + 318  g  m o l    )    \n   [  R N A  ]   ( M )  =   R N A   ( m o l e s )    V   ( l )     \nwith    m  d s R N A     ( g )    = mass of dsRNA in grams,    l  d s R N A    (  b p  )    = length of dsRNA in base pairs, and V (l) = volume in liters.\nIncubate for 20 min.\nFlush 500 μL of preparation buffer though the flow cell to wash away non-tethered RNA constructs.\nInject 100 μL of washed magnetic beads and incubate until 200–300 beads are tethered per field of view, typically after ∼5 min (here, the field-of-view dimensions are 491 μm × 369 μm; see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]: step 5).\nNote: For this protocol we recommend using M280 beads because they can readily reach forces up to tens of pN, and their hydrophobic surface coating t significantly reduces non-specific bead adhesion on the surface compared to hydrophilic M270 beads.\nNote: If unspecific bead adhesion to the surface is apparent, it might be resolved using one of the presented solutions (Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]; Problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]: all magnetic beads are adhered to the surface).\nWash surplus of untethered beads out using 1–2 mL of preparation buffer.\nNote: The magnetic beads should be held at a constant force of ≥2 pN to exclude potential non-specific bead adhesion on the surface before the initiation of RNA synthesis.",
    "Note: If tether formation is not observed, it might be resolved using one of the presented solutions (Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]; Problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]: absence of tether formation).\nCreating a magnetic bead Z-lookup table\nTiming: 5 min\nBead Z-position lookup tables are created as a reference to accurately determine the beads’ vertical position relative to the focal plane over time. There are different ways to determine the bead Z-position in MT. Here, we create an individual look-up table for each dsRNA-tethered bead and reference bead (Cnossen et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Gosse and Croquette, 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nCreate bead Z-position look-up tables (200 steps, 50 nm step size) at a constant force of 10 pN.\nMeasuring the force extension curves for dsRNA and ssRNA\nTiming: 30 min\nThis measurement has to be made only once to estimate the extensions of the dsRNA and ssRNA (created by annealing all fragments with the exception of the CD fragment (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) according to before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin], step 12) constructs as a function of force. This information will be important at later stage to convert the height change of the tethered beads in micrometers to nucleotides synthesized by RdRp.\nMeasure the extension of dsRNA and ssRNA with force ranging from 0.01 to 40 pN.\nRepeat steps 1–34. using the ssRNA construct (without CD transcript).\nDetermine the ssRNA lss(F) and dsRNA lds(F) extensions. Select the lowest possible force at which the the difference between lss(F) and lds(F) is sufficiently large. Larger differences between lss(F) and lds(F) will result in a larger bead displacement in I-direction per nucleotide incorporated by the RdRp, and thus an increased spatial resolution. For the RNA constructs used here, 25 pN was chosen; see also Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1881-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Force-extension curves of ssRNA and dsRNA",
    "Force-extension curve of the dsRNA construct (gray) and the ssRNA construct (red) that lacks the CD fragment. The lines represent a WLC fit to the dsRNA data (black) and a linear interpolation of the ssRNA data (red). During RdRp RNA synthesis, the CD template strand is displaced from the AB strand, gradually increasing the fraction of ssRNA. A constant force of 25 pN (blue) was selected for our experiments due the large difference in extension between dsRNA and ssRNA, which provides high spatial resolution for RdRp RNA synthesis. Error bars represent standard deviation (N = 8).\nTernary complex formation\nTiming: 30 min\nTernary complex formation is the construction of the full RNA tether with a stalled RdRp present on the RNA template. Ternary complex formation can significantly increase RdRp re-initiation efficiency when dinucleotide ApC is used.\nFlush 80 μL of transcription buffer supplemented with 600 nM RdRp, 0.6 mM ATP, 0.6 mM CTP and 1.2 mM ApC dinucleotide into the flow cell.\nIncubate for 20 min.\nWash out all non-bound RdRp with 500 μL of transcription buffer.\nRNA tether characterization\nTiming: 15 min\nIt is important to verify that the dsRNA constructs are singly tethered to a magnetic bead and of correct length. Furthermore, the measured length of each dsRNA tether must be known to convert the reduction in bead height upon RdRp RNA synthesis from micrometers to transcribed RNA nucleotides. The recording of the magnetic bead movement in all three dimensions was conducted with the control software described and published in Cnossen et al. (2014)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]. The measurement parameters were set to: 25 Hz camera frequency, Look Up Table (LUT) range of 10 μm with steps of 50 nm, quadrant interpolation as the algorithm used for the bead’s Z-position determination, and a Region of Interest (ROI) of 90 px.",
    "Start the data acquisition and perform the dsRNA tether characterization by changing the force and magnet rotation over time (see also Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A and 6B) as follows:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1881-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. dsRNA tether characterization measurement and analysis\n(A) The dsRNA tether is stretched from low to high force (  Δ F  ) as well as rotated (  Δ R  ) with a varying speed and number of turns.\n(B) Bead Z-position at zero force (top; red) and applied force (middle; black) during the experiment (here, 25 pN), allowing the determination of the apparent end-to-end length (Lapp) of the dsRNA tether. The magnet is rotated (bottom; blue) to determine whether the dsRNA is singly tethered to the magnetic bead (with -30 turns at the force applied for the RNA synthesis experiment), and to assess the distance Rattach between the off-center attachment point of the dsRNA tether and the bead’s geometric south pole (as defined when the bead’s net magnetic moment (m) aligns with the field, panel D).\n(C) X- and Y-positions of the magnetic bead during slow rotations (0.25 s/turn; see the dashed box in (B)) allow the determination of Rattach using a circular fit.\n(D) The correct end-to-end dsRNA construct length Lcorr is the sum of the apparent length Zext and ΔZ, where ΔZ is the height difference between the off-center dsRNA attachment point.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1881_12.csv\nNote: The undesired tethering of multiple RNA tethers to one bead is signified by a sharp decrease in the bead I-position during the rotation of the magnets in the negative direction at high force. Additionally, the rotations provide information instrumental to the determination of the length of the RNA tether, see below.\nFrom the traces, determine each the magnetic bead’s height at zero force (Z0) and at 25 pN (Zext); see Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B.",
    "Determine the radius of the magnetic beads’ rotational motion Rattach by fitting the plot of X-positions in function of Y-positions with a circle; see Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C.\nNote: The attachment point of the RNA tether to the magnetic bead is in most instances not perfectly at the bead’s geometric south pole (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D) (Klaue and Seidel, 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Lipfert et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). Therefore, the apparent length of tether (Zext) can be significantly smaller than the actual tether length (Lcorr) and needs to be corrected. Slow rotation of the bead will provide crucial information for the correction. While we used Igor Pro (V6.37) as the software platform for the analysis of the bead traces, any other scripting-capable software that is able to import the text file output of the data acquisition software can be used, i.e., commonly used MATLAB and Python.\nCalculate the length difference   Δ Z   between the RNA attachment point Rattach and the bead’s south pole using the bead radius Rbead and the Pythagorean theorem (see also Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D):\n  Δ Z =  R bead  −     R bead  2  −   R attach  2     \nAdd the corrected tether length by adding   Δ Z   to the apparent end-to-end length Zext obtained from the calibration measurement (see Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D):\n   L corr  =  Z ext  −  Z 0  + Δ Z  \nCalculate the average length of an RNA base by dividing Lcorr by the number of base pairs in the construct; this value is later used to convert changes in bead Z-position to synthesized RNA products as a function of time.\nMeasuring RdRp RNA synthesis kinetics\nTiming: 2 h\nAddition of all nucleotides allows the ternary complexes to re-initiate RdRp RNA synthesis (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1881-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Processing of RNA synthesis trajectory data",
    "(A) Schematic of the single-molecule (+)-strand RNA synthesis assay, showing binding of an RdRp to a hairpin at the 3′ end of the (-)-strand (gray) of the surface-attached RNA construct. A magnetic bead attached to the RNA construct is subject to a constant force of 25 pN during RNA synthesis. Primer extension (red) from the 3′ end of hairpin will lead to displacement of the template RNA (gray) from the tethered RNA (black). At 25 pN force, conversion of dsRNA to ssRNA causes a corresponding increase in the distance of the magnetic bead from the surface.\n(B) Non-processed RdRp RNA synthesis example trajectory, normalized to the initial RNA extension prior NTP-addition. The lag time (green) is the time that the RdRp is inactive before re-initializing RNA synthesis upon NTP-addition and can vastly differ between RdRps. RNA synthesis (red) is intermittent, with stochastic pauses of different lifetimes. Arrest or dissociation of the RdRp causes the RNA extension (or bead z-position) to stop changing (blue).\n(C) Superimposed, processed example RNA synthesis trajectories that were cut and converted to RNA nucleotides synthesized (data sets from (Janissen et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7])).\nLower the magnet to the appropriate height to apply a constant force of 25 pN (or any other force determined in steps 34–36).\nRe-initiate RNA synthesis by flushing 100 μL of transcription buffer supplemented with all four rNTPs into the flow cell (the NTP concentration depends on the experiment design; here, 1 mM was chosen).\nImmediately after, start the measurement and record all magnetic bead Z-positions for 2 h.\nNote: Complete absence of RdRp trajectories might be resolved using one of the presented solutions (Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]; Problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]: no RdRp activity observed)."
