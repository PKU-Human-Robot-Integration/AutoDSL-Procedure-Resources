    "This protocol was approved by Sala Uno's human research ethics committee. See Video 1 for sections 1 and 2 and the Table of Materials for details about the equipment used in this study.\n1. Retinal analysis in the OCTA device\nSelect the menu for retinal analysis in the OCTA device.\nSelect a 3 x 3 mm retinal map; select superficial if the OCTA device measures different capillary plexuses.\nSelect vessel length density (or its equivalent, e.g., skeletonized vascular density).\nMeasure vessel length density in mm-1 in a 3 x 3 mm retinal map.\n\tNOTE: The map is divided into two regions: center (within a 1 mm circle, concentric to the foveal center) and inner (outside the 1 mm center circle, Figure 3). The equipment also measures a full density (within the 3 mm circle) and subdivides the inner region into four fields: superior, inferior, temporal, and nasal (Figure 4). Each region is specified so that the vessel length densities are measured automatically. The instruments display the values for center, inner, and full densities and for superior, temporal, inferior, and nasal fields of the inner density.\nReturn to the menu for retinal analysis.\nSelect a 3 x 3 mm retinal map; select superficial if the OCTA device measures different capillary plexuses.\nSelect perfusion density (or its equivalent, e.g., vessel density).\nMeasure perfusion density in % in a 3 x 3 mm retinal map.",

Each region is specified so that the perfusion densities are measured automatically. The instruments display the values for center, inner, and full densities and for superior, temporal, inferior, and nasal fields of the inner density.\nVerify that the density maps have a signal strength > 7; then, verify that the maps have no measurement errors resulting from artifacts or eye movements.\nRegister the values of center vessel length density, center perfusion density, inner vessel length density, inner perfusion density, superior vessel length density, superior perfusion density, inferior vessel length density, inferior perfusion density, temporal vessel length density, temporal perfusion density, nasal vessel length density, and nasal perfusion density in a spreadsheet.\n2. Calculation of the coefficients of determination using a spreadsheet\nSelect the variables to be evaluated (e.g., center vessel length density and center perfusion density). Select the values of both variables for a defined group (e.g., group 1).\nIn the toolbar, click on insert.\nClick on the recommended charts button in the graphs section. Wait for a scatter chart to appear as a suggestion in a window. Click the OK button to accept the suggestion.\nInspect the scatter chart of the data. Right-click on the series to display an options menu.\nSelect the add trendline option. Wait for a linear trendline to be added to the chart and for a menu on the right side of the screen.",
    "Displace the menu downwards to find the Display R-squared value on chart option. Select this option to display the R-squared value on the chart. Select the R-squared-value.\nSelect Home on the toolbar and then click on the copy button.\nPrepare a chart of coefficients of determination on a new page.\nSelect a destination cell (e.g., center coefficient of determination for group 1). Click on the right mouse button. Select paste with keep source formatting.\nPrepare a new chart to show the percentage of perfusion density changes explained by changes in vessel density.\nSelect the cell with the coefficient of determination in the previous chart. Click on the right mouse button. Select copy.\nSelect a destination cell in the new chart (e.g., center in group 1). Click on the right mouse button. Select paste.\nSelect the cell with the pasted value; then, in the toolbar, select home | percent style in the number menu.\nSelect increase decimal in the number menu and click it once.\n\tNOTE: The resulting number is the percentage of changes in perfusion density explained by the changes in vessel density.\nPrepare another table to show the percentage of perfusion density explained by the changes in vessels larger than capillaries.\nSelect a destination cell (e.g., center in group 1). Subtract the last result from 1.\nSelect this cell. Select home in the toolbar.\nSelect percent style in the number menu.\nClick once on increase decimals in the number menu.\nFormat the charts to display the contribution of capillaries (vessel density) and vessels larger than capillaries to the changes in perfusion density.\nRepeat the procedure to obtain the values of inner vessel/perfusion densities and superior, inferior, temporal, and nasal vessel/perfusion densities in group 3.\n3. Comparison of the coefficients of determination",
    "Compare the coefficients of determination in three groups: 1, healthy people; 2, patients with arterial hypertension without hypertensive retinopathy; and 3, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus without diabetic retinopathy. In group 3, also compare the coefficients of determination between fields: superior, inferior, temporal, and nasal.\n4. Compare the percentage differences in the contribution of capillaries and vessels larger than capillaries to perfusion density, between groups and between fields in group 3Subscription Required.
