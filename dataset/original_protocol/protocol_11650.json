    "All animal care and use throughout this protocol adhered to Animal Welfare Act policies the ILAR Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and followed guidelines from the AVMA for euthanasia and the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines and policies. The animal care and use protocol was reviewed and approved by the University of Pennsylvania IACUC for this project. As a matter of compliance and caution, please seek out all necessary authorizations prior to attempting this protocol.\n1. sgRNA and optional donor oligo design\nsgRNA design\n\t\nSelect candidate sgRNAs from any widely used online algorithms, such as Sequence Scan for CRISPR (SSC; http://crispr.dfci.harvard.edu/SSC/)28 or CRISPick (https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gppx/crispick/public)29. As each platform is unique, please carefully read the user instructions in order to design ideal sgRNAs. For in/del experiments, select two to three sgRNAs to test. For deletions, sgRNAs that flank the target region are suggested, for example, two sgRNAs upstream of the target and two sgRNAs downstream of the target.\n\t\tNOTE: While various online sgRNA algorithms factor in off-targets to avoid flawed sgRNA designs, NCBI's BLAST tool is helpful in confirming the quality of the selected sgRNA sequences.\nInsert 19-20 nucleotides (nt) determined from the previous step (1.1.1) into the variable region of the sgRNA oligo (Supplementary Table 1) and purchase synthesized sgRNA as custom DNA oligos.\n\t\tNOTE: PAGE purification is not required.\n(Optional) Donor oligo design for homology directed repair (HDR)-mediated knock-in.\n\t\nDesign the appropriate single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) based on the desired experimental outcome (precise point mutation, loxP insertion, small tag insertion, etc.), keeping the total length to 100-200 nt with homology arms of 50 nt or more flanking the central region.",
    "To ensure higher knock-in efficiency, design the sgRNA to be complementary to the ssODN30, and replace the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence with a silent mutation to prevent recurring cutting by the Cas9 enzyme.\nOrder ssODN using the custom oligo option.\n2. sgRNA synthesis\nTemplate generation for in vitro transcription (IVT)\n\t\nTo generate the DNA template for sgRNA IVT through PCR, prepare an IVT reaction in a PCR strip tube that is RNAse-free. (see Supplementary Table 2).\nUse the following thermal cycler conditions:\n\t\t95 °C for 2 min; 30 cycles of 95 °C for 2 min, 57 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 10 s; then 72 °C for 2 min\nTo verify the success of the sgRNA DNA template PCR reaction, electrophorese 5 µL of the product combined with 1 µL of 6x loading dye on a 2% (wt/vol) agarose gel.\n\t\tNOTE: The anticipated product size is 127 bp. Any remaining PCR reaction can be stored at −20 °C for up to 5 months.\nIn vitro transcription (IVT) of sgRNA\n\t\nTo generate the sgRNA, prepare the reaction mixture (T7 IVT as per manufacturer instructions) in a PCR tube and flick to mix the reagents.\n\t\tNOTE: See Supplementary Table 3 for the reaction setup example. The IVT reaction is RNase contamination sensitive; therefore, make every effort to provide an RNase-free environment.\nTo allow the reaction to initiate and proceed, incubate the IVT reaction mixture for >18 h at 37 °C in either a thermal cycler or heat block.\nTo degrade the original DNA template (step 2.1.3), introduce 1 µL of DNase I (2 units per reaction) and incubate the reaction for 20 min at room temperature (RT).",
    "To promote RNA binding to the magnetic purification beads, combine 129 µL of 100% ethanol in the reaction, which will now be 150 µL.\nTo resuspend the purification beads, which tend to settle during storage, vortex the aliquot for at least 10 s.\nTo purify the sgRNAs, add 100 µL of the resuspended beads (step 2.2.5) to the IVT reaction (step 2.2.4) and gently mix by pipetting up and down 10x.\nTo allow for binding, allow the mixture to rest at RT for 5 min.\nTo isolate the sgRNA from the unincorporated reaction products, place the reaction on the magnetic stands for 5 min at RT and wait until a small pellet forms.\nTo wash the sgRNAs, first carefully discard the supernatant and then add 200 µL of 80% ethanol away from the pellet.\n\t\tNOTE: During the 80% (vol/vol) ethanol wash step, it is critical to avoid disturbing the pellet by pipetting, as this will reduce the sgRNA concentrations considerably. Instead, gently pipette the 80% ethanol so the pellet is submerged, and gently remove the volume with a pipette.\nRepeat the previous step (step 2.2.9) and air dry the pellet for no more than 5-6 min or the sgRNA will be permanently associated with the beads.\nElute the sgRNA with 20µL of nuclease-free water by pipetting the pellet 10x, incubating for 2 min at (RT), and then placing it back on the magnetic stand to separate the beads from the now purified sgRNA.\nTo evaluate the quality and quantity of the sgRNA, use an instrument like a spectrophotometer or bioanalyzer. Alternatively, on a 2% agarose gel, run 2 µL of sgRNAs, similar to step 2.1.3.\n\t\t​NOTE: Quality is confirmed by a single clear band. The remainder of the sgRNA can either be used immediately or stored in −80 °C conditions.",
    "3. Superovulation\nTo provide enough embryos to test each sgRNA design, superovulate two to three C57BL/6J females that are between 3-5 weeks old, as previously described9. Electroporating 20-30 embryos per sgRNA is recommended to generate enough results to confirm effectiveness.\n\tNOTE: If fertilization is successful, expect 10-20 embryos per mating.\nTo induce ovulation, follow this hormone injection schedule:\n\t\nDay 1: Administer 5 IU of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) (100 µL) through an intraperitoneal (IP) injection using a 26 G syringe into 3-5-week-old female mice.\nDay 3: After 46-48 h of PMSG injection, inject 5 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (100 µL) through an IP injection to induce ovulation.\nTo set up breeding, pair females 1:1 with a male of reliable breeding right after hCG injection.\n\t\t​NOTE: To prevent hormones from degrading and losing activity, perform injections under 30 min of thawing.\n4. Embryo collection and processing\nEmbryo collection\n\t\nTo euthanize females and retrieve the necessary material, as previously described31, be sure to first confirm the appropriate method in accordance with institutional policies. For example, use CO2 asphyxiation, cervical dislocation, and/or other approved methods.\n\t\tNOTE: Normally, >75% of hormone-stimulated females display copulatory plugs, indicating successful mating.\nTo prevent hairs from making tissue collection difficult, place the euthanized females on their backs and spray 70% (vol/vol) ethanol on the abdomen region to be surgically opened.\n\t\tNOTE: From this point on, it is advised to perform the surgical steps in a ventilated hood in order to maintain an aseptic environment and reduce the potential for contamination.",
    "To open the abdominal cavity and remove the oviducts, cut the skin/hair (subcutaneous) layer with surgical scissors, and locate the ovaries (Figure 4), which are found near the kidney and share a section of a fat pad. The oviducts are located proximal to the ovaries (Figure 4). Surgically remove both oviducts from the female and place them into individual 50 µL droplets of M2+BSA (4 mg/mL BSA) medium (Figure 5A).\n\t\tNOTE: Detailed instructions for this section of the procedure can be viewed visually31 or followed stepwise9 using previously published protocols.\nTo release the cumulus-oocyte complexes (CoCs) containing oocytes (Figure 4), use dissection forceps to nick the ampulla of the oviduct while viewing through a stereomicroscope.\nTo reduce the amount of debris (blood, fat, tissue), transfer and combine each CoC to a single 50 µL droplet of M2+BSA media with a handheld pipette set to 20-30 µL to avoid the carryover of debris.\nRemoval of cumulus cells\n\t\nTo begin the removal of cumulus cells from the zygotes (Figure 4), transfer CoCs with as little extra media as possible to a droplet of 100 µL M2+hyaluronidase (Figure 5B), and gently mix by pipetting the CoCs until the embryos are visibly separated from the much smaller cumulus cells. Be sure to keep the exposure of M2+hyaluronidase to the embryos to a minimum, as it might impact the viability.\n\t\tNOTE: One can either preheat (37 °C) or add an additional 50 µL of M2+hyaluronidase if the embryos are not separating from the cumulus cells within 2 min.\nTo dilute hyaluronidase and clear away loose cumulus cells from the zygotes, use a mouth-operated pipette to move the zygotes to a fresh 50 µL M2+BSA droplet.",
    "NOTE: Most steps beyond this point require the use of a mouth-operated pipette unless otherwise noted. While the risk of contamination from the user is low, the use of an inline air filter is recommended to maintain an aseptic environment. Please refer to previously described methods to prepare and use this instrument9,31.\nUsing a mouth pipette, pass the embryos through at least four to five more 50 µL M2+BSA droplets to reduce the number of cumulus cells.\n(OPTIONAL) Thinning of the zona pellucida with acid tyrode (AT) solution.\n\t\nTo erode the zona pellucida of the embryo and reduce additional physical obstacles for reagent delivery, transfer the embryos to a prewarmed (37 °C) 100 µL droplet of AT solution on a 60 mm plate (Figure 5C). Continuously observe the zygotes using a stereomicroscope until approximately 30% of the zona pellucida is eroded9. The total AT exposure must be 60-90 s. Prolonged exposure to AT can entirely dissolve the zona pellucida and jeopardize embryo viability.\n\t\tNOTE: For detailed instructions and images of this section of the procedure, please refer to previously published methods9,16.\nTo dilute the AT, use a mouth pipette to pass the embryos through at least four 50 µL droplets of M2+BSA.\nTo determine whether an appropriate number of embryos have been processed, use a stereomicroscope to count the embryos. Depending on the number of female mice used, one can expect approximately 10-20 viable zygotes per female.",
    "​NOTE: At this stage, embryos should be relatively free from debris that would prevent the evaluation of quantity and quality. For example, if using five females, the expected zygote numbers would likely be between 50-100, and a mechanical cell counter would be appropriate to keep track of embryos. It is common to lose about 10%-20% of embryos due to failure to fertilize or low-quality oocytes being ovulated. During the next step, briefly store the embryos in 50 µL of M2+BSA for no more than 30 min in an incubator.\n5. RNP assembly and electroporation\nRNP assembly\n\t\nTo assemble the RNP complex, use the attached example tables to combine the appropriate reaction mixtures based on the desired editing strategy in RNP buffer (100 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 750 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 50% glycerol, and 100 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride [TCEP] in nuclease-free water)\n\t\tNOTE: TCEP is a convenient reducing agent but has a short half-life in aqueous solutions; therefore, add TCEP just before RNP complex assembly.\n\t\t\nFor non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)-mediated indels, refer to Supplementary Table 4.\nFor homology directed repair (HDR)-mediated editing, refer to Supplementary Table 5.\nFor engineering deletions using paired sgRNAs, refer to Supplementary Table 6.\n\t\t\t\nRegardless of strategy, combine the desired reagents at RT in a PCR tube.\nTo allow RNP complex formation, incubate the mixture for 10 min at 37 °C.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: RNP complex can be stored at RT for up to 1 h.\nElectroporation\n\t\nTo dilute the BSA before electroporation, pass the embryos through at least two droplets of 50 µL of reduced serum media.\n\t\tNOTE: BSA increases resistance during electroporation and could damage the zygotes.",
    "To prepare and mix the zygotes (step 4.3.2) with the RNP complex (step 5.1.1.2) for electroporation, mouth pipette 25-30 embryos into a 10 µL droplet of reduced serum media, and then use a handheld pipette to add 10 µL of the RNP complex (step 5.1.1.2).\nTo dilute the viscous glycerol from the RNP complex and homogenize the sample, mix by pipetting 10x or until the mixture no longer shows signs of viscosity (swirl pattern) by using a stereomicroscope.\nTo prepare the sample for insertion into the electroporator, pipette this 20 µL of embryo + RNP mixture into a 0.1 cm electroporation cuvette while avoiding bubbles.\nTo deliver the editing reagents into the zygote, electroporate the embryos using a square-wave protocol with these conditions: 30 V, 4-6 pulses, 3 ms pulse length, and 100 pulse intervals.\nTo retrieve zygotes from the cuvette, use a hand pipette to deliver 50 µL of KSOM+BSA (1mg/mL BSA) into the top of the cuvette to flush the embryos that may have settled to the bottom. Gently pipette this mixture out and onto a 60 mm plate.\nRepeat step 5.2.6 at least 2x-3x and combine each flush on a 60 mm plate until most embryos are recovered.\n\t\t​NOTE: A typical recovery is >90% of the originally loaded embryos. To ensure embryo survival, test the incubator and check the expiration dates for all reagents. Embryos are susceptible to non-ideal culture conditions such as temperature, CO2 level, humidity, and pH.\n6. Embryo culture and genotyping\nEmbryo culture\n\t\nTo culture zygotes to a desired stage, use a mouth pipette to transfer 20-30 zygotes into a droplet of KSOM+BSA in a pre-equilibrated culture plate and move the embryos to the droplet (Figure 5D). Incubate the plate overnight in 5% CO2, at 37 °C, with 95% humidity.",
    "NOTE: Pre-equilibrate by placing a prepared 35mm culture plate in an incubator either the day prior or at least 4 h before incubation (Figure 5D).\nTo promote ideal growth conditions, transfer only two-cell embryos on the following day to a fresh droplet of KSOM+BSA mixture using a stereomicroscope and return to the incubator. Be sure to leave or discard the dead or unfertilized embryos.\n\t\tNOTE: Pronuclear-stage embryos typically grow into morulae after 72 h of culture and blastocysts after 84 h.\nGenotyping\n\t\nTo dilute away the components of the media that might interfere with a PCR reaction, wash the morula/blastocyst embryos using a mouth pipette by passing through two drops of DPBS.\nTo load single embryos for lysis, transfer individual embryos to one well of an 8-well PCR strip by setting a pipette to 1 µL, and then add 10 µL of lysis buffer (50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl ph 8.5, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mg/mL gelatin, 0.45% Nonidet P-40, 0.45% Tween 20, 0.2 mg/mL proteinase K in nuclease-free H2O).\n\t\tNOTE: Add proteinase K just before preparing the lysis buffer.\nTo lyse the embryos, program a thermal cycler to 55 °C for 4 h, and then inactivate the proteinase K with a 10 min incubation at 95 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Particularly for first-time users, attempt an editing experiment at the Tyr loci. This workflow has been optimized and can serve as a positive control. If necessary, store the embryo lysates at 4 °C for 2-3 days or in the freezer for up to 2 weeks before PCR analysis. Prevent repeated freeze-thaw cycles.",
    "To increase the chances of successful genotyping analysis, perform a nested PCR strategy by amplifying slightly longer DNA fragments that flank the targeted site as well as regions that will be used to amplify a more precise DNA fragment. Follow the conditions in Supplementary Table 7.\nFollow the below-mentioned thermal cycler conditions:\n\t\t95 °C for 2 min\n\t\t30+ cycles: 95 °C for 2 min, 60 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 10 s\n\t\t​72 °C for 2 min\nTo prepare the second stage of a nested PCR strategy, make a 1:10 dilution of the first PCR product (step 6.2.5) and load 2 µL of this into the next PCR reaction (with primers designed to be inside the previous amplicon).\n\t\tNOTE: The first PCR reaction must be diluted to reduce the carryover of flanking primers in the second PCR reaction. Prepare the nested PCR by following the steps in Supplementary Table 8.\nPlace the PCR reaction in a thermal cycler using the following cycling conditions:\n\t\t95 °C for 2 min\n\t\t30 cycles: 95 °C for 2 min, 60 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 10 s\n\t\t72 °C for 2 min\n\t\tNOTE: Normally, >90% of PCR reactions are successful when the amplicon size is 500 bp or less.\n(Optional control) For NHEJ-mediated in/del mutations using Tyr as a positive control, digest 10 µL of the nested PCR products from step 6.2.7 by incubating at 37 °C for 4 h using 10 U of HinfI in a 20 µL reaction (see Supplementary Table 9). On a 2% agarose gel, run the digested product to evaluate editing and use a nondigested PCR product as a loading control. Run the gel at 135 V for 30 min.",
    "NOTE: The use of HinfI as an appropriate restriction enzyme was selected due to a conveniently located HinfI site present within the sgRNA target region that is predicted to be ablated upon a successful NHEJ editing. A detailed method and results have been previously described9,16.\n(Optional control) For HDR-mediated mutations using Tyr as a positive control, digest 10 µL of the nested PCR products from step 6.2.7 by incubating at 37 °C for 4 h using 10 U of EcoRI in a 20 µL reaction (see Supplementary Table 10). On a 2% agarose gel, run the digested product to evaluate editing and use a nondigested PCR product as a loading control. Run the gel at 135 V for 30 min.\n\t\tNOTE: The choice of EcoRI as a diagnostic restriction enzyme takes advantage of the original sequence found at the sgRNA target region, where, upon successful HDR, the naturally occurring HinfI site is replaced with an EcoRI site, and a frameshift mutation is forced that interferes with the Tyr gene. For HDR analysis, perform both NHEJ (step 6.2.8) and HDR (step 6.2.9) analyses on each sample as both outcomes can occur and can help determine mosaicism. A detailed method and results have been previously described9,16.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
