  "procedures": [
    "All animal procedures described here were carried out in accordance with institutional guidelines. Animal protocols have been approved by the Charles Darwin animal experimentation ethical board (CEEACD/N°5).\n1. Preparation of endotoxin-free plasmids for MAGIC Markers in utero electroporation\nBacterial transformation\n\t\nOn ice, thaw DH5 alpha competent cells stored at -70 °C.\nWarm up the agar plates containing the appropriate antibiotic (100 µg/mL ampicillin or 50 µg/mL kanamycin) at 37 °C.\nAdd 1 µL of 5–50 ng of MAGIC Markers plasmid DNA in 10 µL of thawed DH5 alpha competent cells and incubate on ice for 10 min without mixing.\nFor the heat shock transformation, place the aliquot in a 42 °C water bath for 45 s, then place immediately on ice and wait 3–5 min.\nUnder sterile conditions, add 230 µL of SOC medium and incubate for 1 h at 37 °C.\nSpread the content of the aliquot over the agar plate and incubate overnight at 37 °C.\nPlasmid culture\n\t\nThe following morning, under sterile conditions, pick up a colony from the agar plate and put it in a 14 mL tube containing 2 mL of LB medium with appropriate antibiotic. Let it incubate for the day at 37 °C in a shaking incubator at 300 rpm.\nAt the end of the day, seed 300 mL of LB with antibiotic using the 2 mL starter culture from step 1.2.1 and incubate overnight at 37 °C in a shaking incubator at 300 rpm.\nPlasmid DNA preparation\n\t\nThe following morning proceed with the purification of MAGIC Markers plasmid DNA (i.e., PB-CAG-Cytbow and Tol2-CAG-Nucbow as well as CAG-driven plasmids expressing PB and Tol2 transposases and Cre recombinase) using an endotoxin-free maxiprep kit following the manufacturer’s protocol.",
    "Elute the DNA in 200 µL of sterile water and estimate its concentration using a spectrophotometer prior to storage at -20 °C.\n2. Preparation for MAGIC Markers in utero electroporation (MM IUE)\nSolution preparation\n\t\nWarm 30 mL of 0.9% saline solution at 37 °C in a water bath and keep it warm during the entire duration of the surgery.\nPrepare a plasmid mix containing PB-CAG-Cytbow and Tol2-CAG-Nucbow (final concentration, 0.8 µg/µL each), PB and Tol2 transposases (final concentration, 0.4 µg/µL each), CAG-seCre (final concentration, 0.16 µg/µL), and 0.01% Fast Green dye in PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+.\n\t\tNOTE: For astrocyte anatomical reconstruction purposes, the Tol2-CAG-Nucbow construct may be omitted. However, this plasmid is useful to distinguish doublets of closely juxtaposed astrocytes and when using MAGIC Markers to probe clonal relationships among astrocytes14.\nPrepare anesthetic solution containing 100 µL of ketamine (100 mg/mL) and 100 µL of xylazine (20 mg/mL) diluted in 2 mL of saline solution.\nPrepare analgesic solution by diluting 0.3 mg/mL buprenorphine stock solution 1:10 in saline solution.\nPreparation of the surgery material\n\t\nSterilize the surgical tools (see Table of Materials) at high temperature in a glass bead sterilizer or equivalent.\nPlace a drop of electrode gel in a 35 mm dish.\nInsert the micropipette in the microinjector holder, break the tip of the micropipette, and aspire the DNA solution.\nPlace a 1 µL drop of Fast Green solution (0.01%) in the lid of a 3 cm dish and, using it as a reference, adjust the diameter of the micropipette’s tip by breaking its tip with fine forceps. Adjust the pressure parameter so that equivalent size drops are produced by the microinjector, thereby enabling delivery of approximately 1 µL of DNA solution per injection.\nPreparation of the pregnant female mouse\n\t\nWeigh the RjOrl:SWISS pregnant mouse.",
    "Perform an intraperitoneal injection with 12.5 µL per gram of body weight (BW) of anesthetic solution. Wait for 5 min and verify that the mouse is asleep by pinching its toe.\nOnce the animal is unresponsive to pinch, inject it subcutaneously with 1.6 µL/g BW of analgesic solution.\nAdd a drop of ocular gel on each eye to prevent drying during the surgery and place the animal belly up on the warming pad.\nGently shave its abdomen, clean it with a pad soaked with iodine, and sanitize the shaved area with an alcohol pad.\nArrange an operating field by placing sterile compresses around the shaved, cleaned, and sanitized area.\n3. In utero electroporation (IUE)\nIntraventricular injection\n\t\nCut a 2 cm-vertical incision along the midline starting in the lower part of the abdomen, through the skin, and then through the underlying muscle. Expose the uterine horns by gently manipulating the embryonic bags and assess the location of the cervix and the number of embryonic bags on each side of the cervix.\nOrient the brain of the E15.5 embryo to be electroporated in order to see the bregma, easily recognized as its location matches with the junction of the three main blood vessels that run along the cerebral fissures.\nImagine a virtual line between the bregma (visible through the skull) and the eye; introduce the micropipette between the virtual line and the longitudinal fissure, then press the injector’s foot pedal to deliver 1 µL of DNA solution in the lateral ventricle of the targeted hemisphere.\n\t\tNOTE: When injected at the proper location, the filled lateral ventricle appears blue, indicating that it has been filled with the DNA solution.\nElectroporation",
    "Apply the electrodes (see Table of Materials), previously dipped in electrode gel, on both sides of the injected embryo with the anode covering the injected hemisphere. Press the foot pedal of the electroporator to deliver a series of four 50 ms pulses of 35 V, each separated by a 950 ms interval.\nDampen the embryo with warmed saline solution.\n\t\tNOTE: The embryos should be kept humid using warmed saline solution during the entire surgical operation and the uterus should not dry out.\nRepeat steps 3.1.2–3.2.2 for each embryo.\nOnce all targeted embryos have been electroporated, replace the uterine horns in the abdomen by gently pushing them with forceps back to their original position. Fill the abdominal cavity with warmed saline solution to prevent the uterus from drying while sutures are made.\nFirst close the abdominal muscle with a continuous absorbable suture, and then the skin with multiple individual stitches (~10) using 4-0 suture.\nPut the animal in a clean cage, lying on its side on a clean paper towel and turn the animal to the other side every 5–10 min until it wakes up and starts moving on its own.\nAssess the state of the animal the following day, especially if a nest has been made.\n\t\tNOTE: No postsurgery treatment is required. In the absence of a nest, any sign of pain (e.g., prostration, shaggy fur), and/or heavy bleeding, the animal should be euthanized without delay.\n4. Tissue harvesting and sectioning\nTissue collection\n\t\nInject phenobarbital (100 mg/kg BW) intraperitoneally for terminal anesthesia at the desired harvesting time. In this case, the harvesting times were at postnatal (P) days P4, P7, and P21.\nPerform intracardiac perfusion using cold premade paraformaldehyde-based solution.\nDissect out the brain and place it overnight at 4 °C in the paraformaldehyde-based solution for postfixation.\nHistology",
    "The following morning rinse the brain 3x for 10 min with 1x PBS.\nEmbed the brain in 3% agarose dissolved in 1x PBS.\nCut 80 µm sections using a vibrating-blade microtome.\nCollect sections in a 24 well plate prefilled with 1x PBS.\nMount sections in the mounting medium (see Table of Materials) between the slide and coverslip. Keep the mounted slides at -20 °C for optimal fluorescent protein preservation and long-term storage.\n5. Multichannel confocal imaging\nMicroscope settings\n\t\nSet up the configuration of the confocal microscope to separately excite mCerulean/mTurquoise2, EYFP, tdTomato/mCherry using 440, 515, and 559 nm laser lines, respectively.\nUse a 20x 0.8 NA (or higher NA) objective and adjust XY sampling and Z-step size according to Nyquist criteria.\n\t\tNOTE: Images acquired with higher resolution (e.g., 60x 1.4 NA oil objective) and deconvolution algorithms will enable reconstruction of the finer details of astrocyte arbors. However, the experimenter should keep in mind that the finest astrocyte processes may not be resolved by conventional optical imaging.\nImage acquisition\n\t\nFind the brightest astrocytes in the electroporated area.\nBecause labeled cells located close to the surface might appear brighter than those deeper in the slice, adjust the acquisition settings on the surface cells to avoid saturating the images.\nAdjust acquisition settings separately for each of the three channels while making sure to avoid pixel saturation using HiLo LUT, which displays zero values as blue and maximum pixel values as red.\n\t\tNOTE: An adequately balanced image should display only a few blue and almost no red pixels.\nAcquire tiled 1,024 x 1,024 pixel Z-stacks using the motorized stage of the microscope, with a 10% overlap between adjacent stacks to subsequently enable mosaic reconstructions of the electroporated area or the zone of interest.\n6. Astrocyte territorial volume segmentation",
    "NOTE: This is performed using a commercial software program (e.g., IMARIS).\nPreparation of the dataset\nCrop the labeled astrocytes within the 3D reconstruction (250 x 250 pixels) by selecting cells entirely enclosed in the imaged tissue section.\n\t\tNOTE: It is also possible to work directly on larger volumes if the computer used can handle them.\nClick on the Blue Surface button in the Object toolbar of the Surpass view to create a new Surface for each astrocyte.\nTo obtain better visualization contrast, first adjust the minimal and maximal color contrast values by clicking on Edit | Show display Adjustment option and dragging both handles. If needed, change the channel color by clicking directly on the channel name in the Display Adjustment window in order to select a new color.\n\t\tNOTE: Preferentially always work with the same color display to prevent visual bias.\nClick on Edit | Image Properties to manually indicate the voxel size in micrometers. If the voxel size is not accurate, the volume calculations will be incorrect.\nSave the new settings.\nSurface segmentation\nUse the Blue Icon to introduce a surface. A Surface icon and box will appear on the Scene list. A Volume box allows to see/hide the dataset.\nSelect the surface line and click on Skip Automatic Creation | Edit Manually.\nClick on Contour | Visibility and click None. Then move to the Select view and click on the Draw button.\nClick on Mode to select the drawing mode.",
    "Use the fast and efficient Isoline semiautomated drawing tool. Define the cell outline by moving the mouse pointer on it. If the isoline preview does not match the astrocyte outline, adjust the mouse pointer position. To validate the preview, left click on the selection. To correct potential mistakes, use the Board window to Delete the current Z-plane contour or press Ctrl + Z.\nUsing Slice | Position to navigate through the Z-planes, move to the next plane by changing the Z-plane number and start a new contour. Preferentially start from the middle of the cell and then move to the extremities.\nWhen contours have been drawn in all the Z-planes containing the astrocyte, click on Create Surface. Before creating a surface, check that all the components are connected. If not, select the largest or connect relevant ones before exporting volume data.\nCheck the quantitative data displayed in the Data Panel and export statistics in spreadsheet format, saving volume value and unit.\nSave the surface under a new name to access it later.\n7. Tracing astrocyte arborization\nNOTE: This is done using open access software program Vaa3D.\nPreparation of the dataset\n\t\nLoad the image stack and search for isolated astrocytes or nearby astrocytes displaying distinct colors.\n\t\tNOTE: The resolution of the reconstruction can be improved by increasing the objective NA and sampling. Ultimately, however, due to the resolution limit of confocal microscopy, the finest astrocyte processes cannot be accurately traced. Care should be taken to avoid oversegmenting beyond the resolution of the acquired images.\nUsing Fiji, crop 250 x 250 pixel image stacks around each astrocyte.\nAs Vaa3D tracing is performed on only one color, select one channel and deactivate the other channels.\nConvert the image to RGB and save it in .tiff format.\nArbor tracing",
    "Open the RGB image in Vaa3D. Go to Image | Data | Geometry then image resampling, and adjust X/Y and Z voxel size values.\n\t\tNOTE: While reconstructing astrocyte arbors, care should be taken not to trace details finer than the resolution provided by the images.\nOpen a 3D window by clicking on Visualize | 3D viewer for the entire image. Right-click on a 3D image and choose 1-right-click to define marker. Point with the cursor the center of the astrocyte and then right-click to set a marker.\n\t\tNOTE: Click on Escape to have access to the 3D view again.\nGo to Advanced | 3D tracing | Vaa3D-Neuron2-auto-tracing.\nOn the newly opened window, select the channel on which to apply the plug-in.\nChoose a background threshold (often between 30 and 90). Adapt this value for each astrocyte if needed.\nUncheck Radius from 2D and keep Auto-down sample and auto-resample checked.\nSet cnn_type at 3, length_thresh at 1, and SR_ratio at 0.1.\nAfter clicking ok, ensure that the plug-in automatically generates two files based on the original name. The suffix –ini.swc and -coordinateX–coordinateY-coordinateZ-app2.swc will be added. Manually add a distinctive label to these name files in order not to overwrite them while continuing to run the plug-in.\nOpen Object Manager, go to Neuron | Line structure, select the traced astrocyte, click on Display Mode, and select Always line mode.\nGo back to the 3D window, where a skeleton of the astrocyte appears.\n\t\tNOTE: If segmentation and signal do not match, repeat steps 7.2.3–7.2.10 and adjust the threshold until they do. Make sure to re-enter the other parameters as they are reset when the plug-in is restarted.\nRight-click on skeleton and select first choice neuron | line#1…APP2_Tracing to access quantitative measurements that will appear on a new window Surface| Object Annotation.",
    "NOTE: Due to the limited resolution of light microscopy, measurements displayed under the listed items Number of branches and Number of bifurcations provide only a rough estimate of astrocyte arbor complexity.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
