    "All protocol follows the guidelines of the North Carolina A&T State University Office of Research Compliance and Ethics.\n1. Chemical Preparation for Keratin Extraction 4\nTo prepare 1,000 ml of 2% wt/vol peracetic acid solution (PAS), under a fume hood add 20 ml of peracetic acid to 980 ml of Deionized (DI) water.\nTo prepare 1,000 ml of 100 mM Tris base solution (TBS), add 12.2 g of Tris Base to 1,000 ml of DI water and stir until completely dissolved.\nPrepare diluted hydrochloric acid solution (DHAS) in a fume hood by pouring 4 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid into 30 ml of DI water.\nProcure approximately 20 g of human hair clippings that have not been chemically treated or altered. Hair can be any length.\nWash the hair thoroughly, by hand, with warm water and soap. Use deionized (DI) water for the final rinse.\nPut the hair into two 600 ml beakers and place in an 80 ºC oven for 1 hr.\nDrain the liquid from the bottom of the beaker and place back in the oven until the hair is completely dry.\nDivide dried hair evenly between the 600 ml beakers, placing 10 g of hair into each beaker. Do not allow the hair to fill more than 500 ml.\nPour 500 ml of PAS into each beaker making sure to cover all of the hair. Cover the beakers with parafilm and store for 12 hr.\n2. Preparation of Keratin Extract Solution\nSeparate the hair from the PAS using a 500 µm sieve. Collect the waste PAS in a separate container. Rinse the hair thoroughly with DI water to remove any leftover PAS.",
    "Place the rinsed hair in a 500 ml flask. Pour 400 ml of TBS into the flask, making sure that the hair is covered. Place flask in a shaking bath set to 38 ºC, 65 rpm for 1 hr.\nAfter 1 hr, remove from shaking bath and pour the liquid, approximately 400 ml of keratin extraction solution (KES), into a 1,000 ml beaker.\nPour 400 ml of DI water into the flask containing the hair ensuring that the hair is covered and place back in the shaking bath for 1 hr. Remove the flask from the shaking bath and pour the remaining 400 ml of the KES into the 1,000 ml beaker with the previously collected KES. The hair is no longer needed and can be dumped out of the flask and discarded in the nearest trash receptacle.\n3. Concentration of Keratin Extract Solution\nFill rotodistiller bath to the top line with distilled water and set to 90 ºC. Set rotation speed to 200 rpm. Turn on the coolant chiller-pump and set to -10 ºC.\nUsing a pH meter to monitor the pH of the KES, use a pipette to slowly add 1 mM DHAS to the KES until reaching a pH 7.0. Stir slowly as the solution is added.\nPour the neutralized KES into the 500 ml round-bottom flask until about quarter full. Run the distiller according to manufacturer's protocol for 1.25 hr.\n\t\nRepeat step 3.3 until all of the KES has been distilled. Ensure that the flask is connected tightly.\n4. Dialysis of Keratin Extract Solution\nPour KES solution equally into 12 separate 14 ml conical tubes. Centrifuge the tubes at 1,050 x g for 10 min.",
    "Pour the centrifuged KES into a clean beaker, making sure to pour away from the collected debris. Repeat until all of the KES has been centrifuged.\nFill a 2,000 ml graduated cylinder with DI water.\nCut dialysis tubing cellulose membrane to 24 inches, and clip one end of the tubing to hold it shut.\nDip the length of the tube in the cylinder of DI water to make it more flexible and easier to open.\nOpen the non-clipped end of the dialysis tubing cellulose membrane and slowly pour 60 ml of centrifuged KES solution into the tubing. Use another clip to close this end of the tubing.\nPut the dialysis tube in the 2,000 ml cylinder of DI water and allow to sit for 24 h. Change the DI water in the cylinder every 3 to 4 hr.\nAfter the 24 hr period, empty the dialyzed KES solution into capped jars, being sure to leave space at the top and place in the freezer at -20° C for 24 hr.\n5. Lyophilization of Keratin Extract Solution\nSet the lyophilizer to -86 ºC.\nRemove the jars containing frozen KES from the freezer, take the caps off of the jars, and place them into freeze dryer ampoules. Place the seals on the ampoules and turn the knob to create a vacuum pressure of 0.133 mBar. Lyophilize the samples for approximately 48 hr, until all of the moisture is gone.\n6. Preparation of Electrospinning Solutions (10 wt % Keratin Solution)\nRemove the Keratin Powder from the lyophilizer and weigh it.\nAdd DI water to the Keratin powder to create a 10% weight/weight Keratin solution.\n7. Preparation of 10% wt PCL Solution",
    "Obtain PCL (ε-caprolactone polymer,Mn 70 - 90 kDa), and trifluoroethanol (TFE). Prepare a 10% by weight PCL in TFE by stirring O/N and obtain a homogeneous mixture.\n8. Preparation of Keratin /PCL Solution\nObtain the 10 wt % PCL solution previously prepared and 10 wt % keratin solution. Add keratin into the PCL solution drop wise in order to create 10 ml PCL/keratin solutions of 90:10, 80:20, 70:30, and 60:40 ratios.\nUse a vortexer to obtain a homogeneous mixture of PCL/Keratin solution before electrospinning.\n9. Production of Electrospun PCL/keratin Fiber\nPlace approximately 8 ml of the PCL/keratin solution in a 10 ml disposable syringe fitted with a 0.5-mm diameter plastic tube. Place the syringe in a syringe pump where the flow rate is set to be 2.5 ml/hr.\nApply voltage to the tip of the needle connected to the tube (positioned ~23 cm from the fiber collecting drum, and ~30 degree from the horizontal). Apply a 19 - 22 kV voltage to the tube and rotate the collector drum at around 200 rpm.\n\t\nWrap the collector drum with aluminum foil before running the sample. Ensure that the aluminum foil is stable by applying the labeling tape on either end.\n\t\tNote: The fibers will form on the aluminum foil (See Figure 2), store the fiber covered foil at RT.\n10. Mechanical Analysis of PCL/Keratin Nanofibers\nCut the sample into 60 mm by 8 mm. Make sure to record the thickness by using digital micrometer. For each composition prepared, use five samples.\nAttach the 60 x 8 mm sample in the tensile tester. Use a custom designed specimen holder to attach the sample. Sandwich the sample between specimen holders which is made from an index card using double-sided tape. Apply the 10 N load cell with a displacement rate of 10 mm/min.",
    "Note: The specimen holder was designed to be 62 mm by 40 mm with an inner window of 50 mm by 38 mm.\nRecord extension and load values through software according to software protocol.\nCalculate stress by dividing the force by area of the sample tested. Next, calculate strain by dividing the change in length by initial length.\nGenerate the stress-strain curve by plotting stress in y-axis for corresponding strain value in x-axis.\nCalculate the Young's modulus from the linear region where slope equals to modulus of elasticity. Determine tensile strength from the stress strain plot by taking 0.2% offset in strain and drawing a parallel line to the linear region curve.\nPerform the statistical analysis of the mechanical data obtained in triplicate previously using one-way analysis of variance using analysis software8. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n11. Surface Morphology and Structural Characterization\nUse scanning electron microscope (SEM) with parameters of accelerating voltage of 15 kV and current of 5 µA to observe the morphology of the electrospun fibers.\n\t\nPrior to imaging with SEM, cut a 2 cm2 section of the fiber and attach it to a SEM stage using copper tape. Place the stage inside the sputter coater and coat with gold at 15 mA for 1 min and 30 sec to create a gold layer approximately 11 nm thick. Load the sample into the chamber of the SEM. Observe the fiber samples.\nUse Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to characterize the chemical bonding between the PCL and keratin. Place the 2 cm2 section of the electrospun nanofiber membrane in a magnetic holder and purge the system with dry air before testing. Obtain spectra for 200 scans and analyze the spectra using standard software according to software protocol.",
    "Perform spectrum analysis using standard software and use triplicates of each ratio of nanofiber according to the manufacturer's protocol.\n12. Study of Cell-fiber Interaction\nCut fibers into 16 mm2 samples. Use a biocompatible, silicone-based glue to fix each sample to coverslips with a 12 mm diameter.\nGlue one end of the fiber sample to the back of the cover slip, wrap the sample around the coverslip, then glue the free end of the sample to the back of the cover slip as well, leaving the top of the slip covered with only the fiber sample.\nPlace the fiber samples in a 24-well plate. Sterilize the samples by immersing in 80% ethanol for 1 hr.\nRinse the ethanol from the samples using DI water. Then, pipette 2 ml of basal medium onto the samples, making sure to cover the entire sample. Remove the medium after 5 min.\nUse fibroblast 3T3 cells to seed the fiber samples. Suspend the cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) so that there are approximately 62,000 cells/cm2 per 1 ml of DMEM.\nDrop 1 ml of the 3T3 cell-containing DMEM solution into each well plate ensuring that each fiber sample is covered with approximately 62,000 cells/cm2. Incubate the well-plates for 24 hr at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Note: Use 5% CO2 because that level can usually maintain the pH of the cell media in physiological range for days.\n13. Degradation of Nanofiber Matrix\nCut dried PCL/keratin nanofiber membranes into square approximately 30 mm x 30 mm.\nSterilize the 900 mm2 samples with 80% alcohol for a 10 min incubation period and wash thoroughly with DI water. Incubate the samples in 15 ml of PBS, pH 7.5, at 37 ºC. Replace the buffer every 3 days.",
    "Take the membranes out of the solution at specified intervals, 1 week and 7 weeks, and rinse with DI water.\nPlace the membrane samples into freeze dryer ampoules. Place the seals on the ampoules and turn the knob to create a vacuum. Lyophilize for 24 hr, until completely dry.\nAttach the dried sample it to a SEM stage using copper tape. Place the stage inside the sputter coater and coat with gold at 15 mA for 1 min and 30 sec.\nLoad the sample into the chamber of the SEM. Observe the fiber samples at an accelerating voltage of 1.5 kV and 5 µA current.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
