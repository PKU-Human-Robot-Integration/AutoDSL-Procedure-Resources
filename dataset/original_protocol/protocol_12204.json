  "procedures": [
    "Animal usage follows the procedures specified in protocol M/11/181 approved by the Vanderbilt Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee for Gu. CD1 or CBA/Bl6 mice were purchased from commercial vendors and crossed in the Vanderbilt animal facility to obtain neonatal mice.\n1. Preparation of Mice, Stock Solutions, and Equipment\nFor the mouse cross: set up a mouse cross and record the plugging dates to aid experimental planning. CD1 mice usually give birth around day 19 after mating. Use CD1 or CBA/Bl6 crosses to obtain CD1 or CBA/Bl6 neonates, respectively. Intercrosses between the two lines utilize CD1 females and CBA/Bl6 males.\nFor the collagenase stock: weigh 200 mg collagenase Type IV with a high precision balance. Transfer to a 50 mL centrifuge tube. Dissolve in 40 mL HBSS with Ca2+/Mg2+ (1.26 and 0.5 mM, respectively) to make a 5 mg/mL stock solution.\n\t\nAllow collagenase to dissolve for ~ 30 min with gentle shaking. Aliquot and keep the solution frozen in -20 °C as stock, which stays active for at least one year.\nAutoclave to sterilize several pairs of tweezers, scissors, and P20 tips for dissection and islet picking.\nFor the 1 M glucose stock: weigh 9 g glucose in a 50 mL centrifuge tube, add 50 mL RPMI 1640 media to dissolve the glucose. Keep in 4 °C until use, but no more than 6 months.\n2. Working Solutions\nNOTE: The day of islet isolation, prepare the following reagents.\nFor the collagenase type IV working solution: thaw and dilute collagenase stock on ice. Dispense 0.15 mL stock into each 1.7 mL microfuge tube. Add 1.35 mL HBSS with Ca2+/Mg2+. Invert the tube 5 times. Leave on ice for 15 min.",
    "Spin at high speed for 3 min in a microcentrifuge. Transfer supernatant to a new tube. Leave on ice until use. Discard the tube with insoluble debris.\nFor complete RPMI 1640 media: add 2.5 mL 1 M glucose, 50 mL heat inactivated FBS, and 5 mL 100x Pen-strep stock into 500 mL RPMI 1640 media. Leave on ice until use.\n3. Pancreas Isolation and Digestion\nEuthanize neonates with isoflurane, followed by decapitation according to approved protocols.\nLay the mouse with its belly facing up. Spray with 70% ethanol for sterilization.\nLift the belly skin up with tweezers and cut the skin and muscle layers longitudinally along the midline with a pair of scissors, from the genital area to the rib cage. This opens the abdominal cavity to expose all internal organs.\nTransfer all the internal organs to a 100 cm dish with a pair of tweezers. Locate the pancreas, which is a scattered-organ with a dorsal portion that clings to the stomach and spleen and a ventral portion that clings to the duodenum11.\nAdd HBSS into the dish to submerge the organs. In solution, the pancreatic tissues no longer cling to the duodenum, stomach, or spleen. It is readily recognizable under a dissecting scope because of its typical white color. Use a pair of tweezers to peel the pancreatic tissues away from surrounding tissue and transfer to a new 60 mm dish with HBSS.\nCut each pancreas with a scissor into pieces smaller than 5 mm across any dimensions. Transfer to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Up to five pancreata (younger than P7) can be digested in one tube. For P8-P16 mice, use one tube per pancreas.",
    "Add 0.5 - 1 mL collagenase working solution to each tube (0.2 mL for each P1-P7 pancreas. Use 0.5 mL for each P8-P16 pancreas). Leave the tube in a 37 °C incubator for up to 15 min. Invert the tube two times every min.\nAfter ~ 5 min, tap the tube to monitor the digestion status of the pancreatic tissue. Continue the digestion process until most of the pancreatic tissue appears as fragmented cell clusters, with diameter < 2 mm. The lysate will appear cloudy, which is due to normal acinar cell autolysis.\n4. Lysate Washing\nSpin the lysate at 500 x g for 10 s in a microcentrifuge. Remove the supernatant layer with a P1,000 pipetman. The supernatant should appear turbid but devoid of cell clusters. Do not use aspiration, which may quickly aspirate away the tissue fragments at the bottom due to the presence of some sticky DNA.\nAdd 1 mL RPMI 1640 complete media. Tap the tube gently to resuspend the fragmented lysate. Invert up and down 10 times. Repeat step 4.1.\nRepeat step 4.2 two more times or until the supernatant appears clear. Re-suspend washed pancreatic fragments in 1 mL complete RPMI 1640 media.\n5. Islet Isolation\nNOTE: For small numbers of pancreata, direct hand-picking as below (5.1) can be used for islet isolation. For large numbers of pancreata (> 6), the method outlined in 5.2 is preferred.\nDirect hand-picking:\n\t\nTransfer lysate from step 4.3 to a 60 mm dish. Add 5 mL complete RPMI 1640 media. Bring under a dissecting microscope.",
    "Set up the bright field illumination on the microscope. Adjust the light intensity to ~ 50% of the maximum power. Under this condition, islets appear as slightly pink clusters, whereas acinar cells as dark irregular-shaped clusters (Figure 1A). A magnification of ~ 50X (combining the power of the objective and the eye piece) is recommended to offer the best way of visualizing islets and the pipet tip opening simultaneously for picking.\nPick up islets with a P20 pipette tip while avoiding acinar clusters. Dispense islets-enriched fractions to a new 60 mm dish with RPMI complete media (Figure 1B).\nRepeat the hand-picking process twice more. Leave pure islets in a new 60 mm dish with 4 mL complete RPMI media (Figure 1C).\nGradient centrifugation:\n\t\nPrepare a 15 mL centrifuge tube that is preloaded with 2 mL polysucrose and sodium diatrizoate at a density of 1.077 g/mL. Leave the tube on ice until use.\nTransfer the suspension from step 4.3 onto the top of the polysucrose and sodium diatrizoate solution with a Pasteur pipette. Do not disturb the bottom layer. Tissues from up to 10 newly born or 2 P17 pancreata can be loaded into each 15 mL tube.\nSpin the tube at ~ 600 x g in a swing rotor for 15 min at 4 °C. Use brake-off settings.\nAfter centrifugation, transfer the media and interphase layers (note that under ideal operation conditions, the islets will be located in the interphase between the polysucrose and culture media after centrifugation) into a new 15 mL tube. Add 10 mL media, mix gently but thoroughly.",
    "Spin down the islet-enriched fraction at 300 x g for 5 min. Remove the wash media. Repeat the wash one more time with complete RPMI media. Resuspend pellets in to 4 mL media, which contains mostly islets and ducts (Figure 1D).\nHand-pick the islets as outlined in section 5.1.\n6. GSIS Assays in Isolated Islets\nIncubate the islets from step 5.1.4 in complete RPMI media for 2 h in a 37 °C tissue culture incubator.\nUse a pipette to remove RPMI under a dissecting microscope. Add 3 mL KRB solution with 2.8 mM glucose to the plate3. Swirl 10 times to wash the islets. Remove KRB solutions.\n\t\nRepeat the washing process once. Incubate the islets with 3 mL KRB solution at 37 °C for 1 h in an incubator.\nAliquot 1 mL KRB into each well of a 12-well plate. Pre-warm the KRB stock and plate to 37 °C in an incubator.\nWash the islets twice with pre-warmed KRB as in 6.2. Transfer 10 islets to each well of the pre-warmed plates. Incubate in a 37 °C incubator.\nAfter 45 min, withdraw 50 µL of supernatant. This contains the insulin solution secreted under basal glucose.\nAdd 32 µL 500 mM glucose. Swirl the plate 20 times to mix the solution. Incubate in a 37 °C incubator. Swirl the plate 5 times once every 5 min.\nAfter 45 min, withdraw 50 µL supernatant. This is the insulin secreted under high glucose.\nTransfer all islets to a 1.5 mL tube. Freeze in -20 °C for 30 min. Thaw at room temperature for 5 min. Repeat the freezing and thawing process.\nAdd 0.5 mL 70% ethanol with 20 mM HCl. Leave overnight. This is the insulin left in islets.\nUse conventional ELISA to assay insulin levels, described previously3.",
