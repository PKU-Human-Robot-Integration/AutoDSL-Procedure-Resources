    "DNA extraction procedureCollect 50-100 mg of leaf tissue in a 1.5 ml centrifuge microtube. Flash-freeze the tissue in liquid nitrogen and grind it with a plastic pestle.Add 300 µl of extraction buffer and mix it vigorously by vortexing (5-10 s) to homogenize the tissue. Incubate the homogenate at 65 °C for 30 min in a thermostatic bath.Add 100 µl of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1) and mix the sample gently by inversion.Centrifuge the homogenate at 20,800 x g at 4 °C for 5 min.By using a 200 µl micropipette, carefully pipette the aqueous phase and transfer it to a new microtube.Add 500 µl of ice-cold ethanol:acetate (24:1) and mix the sample by inverting the microtube 2-3 times to precipitate the DNA, and let it settle at -20 °C for 30 min.Centrifuge the sample at 20,800 x g at 4 °C for 10 min to form a DNA pellet at the bottom of the microtube.Discard the supernatant and clean the pellet with 100 µl of 70% ethanol. Vortex the tube for 1 min to wash the pellet.Centrifuge the sample at 15,300 x g at room temperature for 5 min and let the pellet dry by inverting the microtube onto a paper towel for 30 min until the ethanol evaporates completely or by placing it in a drying chamber for 15 min.Resuspend the DNA in 50 µl of ultrapure water with RNase A (50 μg·ml-1). Incubate at room temperature for 30 min.Store the DNA sample at 4 °C until use. If the DNA will not be used for a long time, store it at -20 °C.Check the integrity and purity of the extraction by loading 2 μl of the DNA solution on a 0.8% agarose gel and running it at 90 V for 30 min.",
    "It should show a thick band of high molecular weight, above 21 Kbp, with no smear (Figure 1).Measure the concentration of DNA samples in a spectrophotometer and prepare working solutions of ~100 ng·μl-1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200701/20200701184500_6160.jpgFigure 1. Representative image of DNA samples visualized in a 0.8% agarose gelDigestion with EcoRICalculate the volume of the sample that corresponds to 700 ng of DNA, according to its concentration. However, consider that DNA concentration should be higher than 40.5 ng·μl-1, otherwise it will exceed the reaction’s final volume.Calculate the amount of each reagent needed for the total number of samples based on Table 2. To compensate pipetting errors, it is convenient to consider an additional sample to the total number of analyzed samples.Table 2.

Homogenize gently by inversion or by flicking the tubes (do not vortex) and centrifuge for 10 s.Incubate at 37 °C overnight in an incubator.Place the tubes on ice if you continue with the next step. Otherwise, store them in freezer at -20 °C until use.Digestion with HpaII and MspIFor each tube from the previous reaction (B), distribute the content into two tubes (10 μl in each tube) and label the new tubes with the sample code, adding the letter \"H\" to one and the letter \"M\" to the other. From now on you will work with two tubes for each analyzed sample.Two Master mixes will be prepared, only differing on the restriction enzyme, one with HpaII and the other with MspI. For the two reactions, calculate the required amount of each reagent for the total number of samples plus one, based on Table 3.Table 3.",
