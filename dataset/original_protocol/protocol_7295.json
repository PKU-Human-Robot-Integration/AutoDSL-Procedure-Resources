    "Retrovirus Production Note: All handling of retroviral production and transduction occurred under a BSL-2 hood. RV produced from Plat-E are replication incompetent and ecotropic. However, many commonly used genes of interest have been identified as oncogenes, e.g., HRasG12V (Huang et al., 2017). Maintain Plat-E cells in a T75 flask with full DMEM + Puromycin/Blasticidin (see Recipes).Seed 4 × 106 Plat-E cells into a 100 mm dish with full DMEM media without Puromycin/Blasticidin.Transfect Plat-E cells at ~70%–80% confluent, normally ~18–24 h after seeding.Warm OPTI-MEM and TransIT®-293 to room temperature.Pipette 1 mL of OPTI-MEM into a polypropylene 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.Add 10–15 μg bicistronic retroviral vector plasmid DNA to OPTI-MEM. Gently pipette to mix.Note: Adjust total plasmid for optimal transfection efficiency. In our experience, 10–15 μg is appropriate for most plasmids. Before use, vortex TransIT®-293 for 0.5 seconds. Pipette 30–45 μL TransIT®-293 to the OPTI-MEM + plasmid mixture. Gently pipette to mix.Note: A ratio of 1 μg plasmid DNA to 3 μL TransIT®-293 works well for most plasmids. Adjust total amount of plasmid DNA and ratio DNA:TransIT®-293 reagent to optimize. Incubate transfection mixture at room temperature for 20 min.Add transfection mixture dropwise to cells, evenly distributed across the plate. Rock gently back and forth to spread evenly.Return cells to incubator.At 24 h post-transfection, collect culture media, and replace with fresh prewarmed full DMEM media.Centrifuge the collected media at 600 × g and 4 °C for 5 min, then pass through a 0.45 μm filter into a clean 50 mL tube. Store filtered media at 4 °C.Repeat steps 11 and 12 at 48- and 60-h post transfection, and combine filtered media into a single 50 mL tube.Add one volume of Retro-X concentrator per three volumes of filtered media.Gently invert tube to mix.Incubate at 4 °C overnight.",
    "Centrifuge at 1,500 × g and 4 °C for 45 min.Discard supernatant. Resuspend pellet in 1/10th of the original volume, in full RPMI media.Use concentrated RV media immediately, or store at -80 °C in single use aliquots. Under these conditions, RV may be stored up to 2 years after production.Isolation of Naïve CD4+ T cells Collect spleen and lymph nodes (superficial cervical, brachial, and inguinal are easily accessible) from IL10GFP/Foxp3RFP dual reporter mouse model.Homogenize tissues through a 70 μm cell strainer via grinding, and transfer to a 15 mL centrifuge tube.Centrifuge at 600 × g for 5 min.Discard supernatant and resuspend cells in 1 mL of 1× RBC lysis buffer (see Recipe 4). Add RBC Lysis Buffer to 5 mL. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.Add 2 mL of full RPMI media to neutralize the lysis reaction. Centrifuge at 600 × g for 5 min.Discard supernatant, resuspend in 1 mL of full RPMI media, and transfer to a 1.5 mL tube.Centrifuge at 1,500 × g for 1 min, aspirate supernatant, and resuspend in primary biotin antibody master mix (see Recipe 5), using 200 μL per mouse. Remove irregular clumps if any are present.Incubate on ice for 15 min, shaking every 5 min.During incubation, prepare magnetic anti-biotin microbeads + sorting antibody master mix (see Recipe 6).Add 1 mL of full RPMI media to cells. Centrifuge at 1,500 × g for 1 min, aspirate supernatant, and resuspend in magnetic anti-biotin microbeads + sorting antibody master mix.Incubate cells on ice for 15 min, shaking every 5 min.While cells are incubating, prepare MS or LS magnetic separation columns on the MACS Multistand. Pre-wet columns with full RPMI media at room temperature. Load a sterile collection tube under the magnetic separation column.MS column holds one spleen. Pre-wet with 0.",
    "5 mL of full RPMI media.LS column holds four spleens. Pre-wet with 2 mL of full RPMI media.Add 1 mL of full RPMI media to cells. Centrifuge at 1,500 × g for 1 min, and aspirate supernatant.Resuspend cells in 550 μL of full RPMI media. Take 500 μL from the top of the tube, and load into magnetic separation columns. Allow media to flow through.To increase yield, add 550 μL of RPMI to the 1.5 mL tube. Take 500 μL from the top of the tube, and load into magnetic columns.Allow cells to flow through the column into the sterile collection tube. The naïve T cells are in the flow-through and are ready for sorting (Figure 1A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4499/bioprotoc-12-17-4499-g001.jpgFigure 1.

Representative FACS plots of gating strategy for isolating naïve CD4+ T cells by flow sorting for in vitro differentiation (B). Adapted from Huang et al.

An example of the gating strategy is presented in Figure 1B (Huang et al., 2017).Centrifuge purified naïve CD4+ T cells at 600 × g for 5 min. Discard supernatant. Resuspend at 1 × 106 cells/mL in full RPMI media.Tr1 Cell Differentiation To obtain antigen presenting cells (APCs), homogenize spleen of Rag-/- mouse through a 70 μm strainer into 5 mL of full RPMI media.Add Mitomycin C to a final concentration of 50 μg/mL. Incubate at 37 °C for 30 min.Centrifuge at 600 × g for 5 min. Discard supernatant.Resuspend cells in 1 mL of full RPMI media. Transfer to a 1.5 mL tube.",
    "Wash cells by centrifuging at 1,500 × g for 1 min. Aspirate supernatant. Resuspend in 1 mL of full media. Repeat wash step a total of four times.Aliquot 10 μL of cells into 90 μL of 3% Acetic Acid with Methylene Blue. Mix by pipetting, and count APCs using a hemocytometer and light microscope. Resuspend at 3 × 106 cells/mL.Mix equal volumes of Mitomycin C treated Rag-/- APCs and purified naïve CD4+ T cells. The final ratio of naïve CD4+:APCs is 1:3 at 0.5 × 106/mL naïve CD4+ T cells, with 1.5 × 106/mL APCs.Add anti-CD3ϵ, anti-CD28, and IL-27 to the CD4+:APCs mixture at a final concentration of:1 μg/mL anti-CD3ϵ (145-2C11)1 μg/mL anti-CD28 (37.51)25 ng/mL IL-27Plate 200 mL of cells per well in a 96-well flat bottom plate.Incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Transduction Note: All handling of retroviral production and transduction occurred under a BSL-2 biosafety cabinet.
