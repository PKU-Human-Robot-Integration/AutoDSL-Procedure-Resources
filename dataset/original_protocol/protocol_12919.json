    "1. Sample Preparation\nPreparation of DNA substrates11\nGenerating a ssDNA gap in the plasmid\n\t\t\nCompletely digest a sample of the plasmid (here: modified pUC19, pUC19N) in a reaction tube with an appropriate nickase (here: Nt.BstNBI) followed by enzyme heat inactivation, using conditions according to the manufacturer's protocol (see Figure 1 for a schematic presentation). Start with ~50 µL and ~500 nM plasmid for a sufficient yield.\nVerify plasmid nicking by agarose gel electrophoresis on diluted samples (~20 nM)15. Wear gloves for protection against the DNA binding dye used for DNA visualization.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Different electrophoretic mobilities allow distinction between nicked (relaxed) and supercoiled circular plasmid DNA (Figure 1).\nRemove the incised ssDNA stretch (between the nick sites) from the plasmid by incubation with a ~10-fold excess of the complementary oligonucleotide (oligonucleotide 1 in Table 1), shaking at 300 rpm for 30 min near the melting temperature of the oligonucleotide (here: 68 °C for pUC19N) in a heat block (Figure 1).\nSeparate the gapped plasmid from the smaller DNA fragments using a 50 kDa molecular weight cut off (MWCO) filter by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 x g in a table centrifuge (Figure 1). To extract the concentrated DNA from the filter, invert the filter and insert into a new 1.5 mL reaction tube. Centrifuge for 3 min at 1,000 x g.\nRefill the resulting concentrated DNA sample to 500 µL with deionized, filtered water, add an additional ~5-fold excess of complementary oligonucleotide and repeat steps 1.1.1.3 and 1.1.1.4 at least 3 times.",
    "Test for complete gapping of the DNA by incubation with a suitable restriction enzyme (here: XhoI or BglII) using conditions according to the manufacturer's description. Use diluted (nicked versus gapped) DNA samples (~20 nM). Run an agarose gel electrophoresis to distinguish between linearized plasmid (containing no ssDNA gap) and non-incised DNA (gapped DNA) using the nicked DNA as positive control (include a DNA ladder for reference, Figure 1). Wear gloves.\nRefilling the gap with modified ssDNA oligonucleotides\n\t\t\nAnneal the gapped plasmid via incubation with a ~25-fold excess of a 5' phosphorylated oligonucleotide that contains the specific target site(s) of choice, incubating at ~45 °C for 4 h (Figure 1). Here, use 48 nt ssDNA containing a lesion, either a fluorescein adducted thymine or a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD), and in addition a short (8 nt) non-complementary sequence to produce DNA bubbles (see Table 1).\nCovalently link the annealed insert to the plasmid by incubation with T4 DNA ligase overnight at room temperature according to the manufacturer's protocol (Figure 1). For this reaction, add ATP containing concentrated buffer stock solution to produce suitable buffer conditions for the ligase (e.g., use UvrB reaction buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM ATP).\nTest for the insertion of the specific oligonucleotide into the gapped plasmid by digestion of diluted samples with a suitable restriction enzyme (same as in 1.1.1.6) according to the manufacturer's protocol followed by an agarose gel electrophoresis (as in 1.1.1.6, Figure 1).\nPreparation of linear DNA substrate",
    "Digest the modified plasmid DNA with restriction enzymes (ideally with a single restriction site in the plasmid) using conditions as recommended by the manufacturer (Figure 1). This step produces linear fragments containing the inserted modification at a defined position. Here, use SspI and BspQI cutting at positions 613 and 255 bp upstream and downstream of the insert, respectively, resulting in a 916 bp DNA fragment containing the specific lesion site at ~30% of the DNA length.\n\t\t\tNOTE: For AFM imaging experiments as described here, DNA fragments with lengths between ~200 bp and ~2,000 bp are suitable substrates.\nIsolate the target fragment via agarose gel electrophoresis and gel extraction using a commercial kit. Wear gloves for protection.\nOptionally, cut agarose gel with a scalpel to separate the DNA ladder and diluted sample lanes (first two lanes) from the lanes containing the concentrated DNA to be purified. Only expose the gel part with the first two lanes to UV irradiation by placing only this part of the gel on a UV table.\n\t\t\t\nCut out the band corresponding to the fragment of choice with a scalpel. Re-unite the two gel parts (off the UV table). Use the position of the excised band from the dilute sample as orientation for the position of the band of the desired DNA substrate. Account for the higher concentration by cutting out slightly broader slices than for the dilute control.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: Because here, recognition of UV-lesions was investigated, introduction of additional UV lesions via UV irradiation was carefully avoided in the DNA substrate by this approach.\nCalculate the DNA concentration c from the absorption at 260 nm measured by a UV-Vis spectrophotometer using Lambert-Beer's law with a double stranded DNA (dsDNA) average molar extinction coefficient of ϵ260nm ~6,700 M−1 cm−1 per bp:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55501/55501eq1.jpg",
    "where L is the path length (measurement chamber length, typically 1 cm).\nExpression and purification of proteins\nRecombinantly express UvrB in E. coli and purify the protein via standard chitin bead affinity15 and size exclusion chromatography15 as previously described16.\n\t\tNOTE: The uvrB gene from Bacillus caldotenax had been cloned into the pTYB1 vector.\nExpress XPD in E. coli and purify the protein via standard nickel IDA affinity15 and size exclusion chromatography15 followed by anion exchange chromatography15, as previously described17.\n\t\tNOTE: The gene for Chaetomium thermophilum Xeroderma pigmentosum group D protein (XPD) had been cloned into the pBADM11 vector. C. thermophilum p44 was a kind gift from Caroline Kisker's laboratory, expressed and purified as described17.\n2. AFM Experiment\nSample preparation\nOptionally, pre-incubate the DNA substrate at 65 °C for 10 min in a heat block to remove potential micro-salt crystals that may have formed during storage in the fridge.\nPrepare reaction buffer(s) at a 10-fold concentration (10x buffers).\n\t\tNOTE: XPD reaction buffer at 1x concentration contained 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM TCEP, 2 mM ATP; 1x UvrB reaction buffer contained 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, and 1 mM ATP.\nPre-incubate proteins at a higher concentration in suitable incubation conditions to enhance complex formation. Pre-dilute a small volume (e.g., 1 µL) of the individual proteins in 1x protein reaction buffer to the desired concentration and mix small volumes (e.g., 1 µL) of the individual protein solutions in a 0.5 mL reaction tube.",
    "Place the tube in a heat block for incubation temperatures higher than room temperature. Choose a concentration ratio depending on the expected complex stoichiometry, either equimolar or corresponding concentrations. Here, incubate 1 µL XPD (20 µM in 1 x XPD reaction buffer) and 1 µL p44 (20 µM in 1x XPD reaction buffer) at 10 µM each for 10 min at 37 °C.\nIncubate samples at suitable protein and DNA concentrations in protein reaction buffer in a 0.5 mL reaction tube. Here, use 500 nM UvrB or 1 µM XPD + 1 µM p44 and 100 nM DNA. Pipette small volumes to save material, e.g., 0.25-0.5 µL protein (pre-diluted to a 10-fold incubation concentration) and DNA in a total volume of 2.5-5 µL of 1x protein reaction buffer. Here, incubate for 30 min at 37 °C in a heat block. Spin down in a reaction tube briefly (~1 s) in a table centrifuge to ensure mixing of small volumes.\nSample deposition\nPrepare a mica substrate: cut an approximately 1 x 1 cm2 piece of mica from larger strips using a scalpel. Strip off top layers of the multi-layered mica mineral piece using adhesive tape to reveal a clean, flat, and atomically smooth substrate surface.\n\t\tNOTE: The mica piece can be re-used for multiple experiments by stripping off further layer(s).\nPrepare the AFM deposition buffer with deionized, filtered water, e.g., 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 25 mM Na-acetate, 10 mM Mg-acetate. Filter through a 0.02 µm syringe filter.",
    "NOTE: Divalent cations in the deposition buffer serve to chelate the negatively charged DNA molecules to the mica surface, which also is negatively charged at neutral pH. If the relatively high Mg2+ ion concentration in the deposition buffer poses a problem for a particular protein-DNA system, alternatively, the mica surface can be pre-loaded with amino groups using silatrane-based chemistry to provide positive surface charges for anchoring18. Sample deposition can then be carried out in a buffer that contains no or only low amounts of divalent cations.\nDilute the sample (see 2.1) for immediate deposition onto mica in deposition buffer. Deposit a small volume (here: 20 µL).\n\t\tNOTE: Dilution factors depend on the sample concentration. Here, dilute samples 50-100x. As a rule of thumb, ~1 nM DNA results in a good surface coverage for ~1,000 bp.\nImmediately rinse sample three to four times with a few milliliters of filtered, deionized water, blot off excess liquid, and blow dry in a gentle stream of nitrogen. The entire process from sample deposition to dried samples can be carried out within less than 30 s.\nFix the piece of mica on a microscope slide using adhesive tape at its edges.\n\t\tNOTE: Different AFM systems have different requirements for fixing the sample to the stage. Other AFMs possess magnetic stages, and the mica pieces are fixed onto magnetic disks, e.g., using thermal glue. Details of the AFM system used here can be found in the Table of Materials.\nAFM imaging\nPlace the sample (see 2.2.5) centrally on the AFM stage and fix the microscope slide on the stage with magnetic pads.",
    "Insert the AFM tip into the tip holder. Use cantilevers with a sharp (<10 nm) AFM probe suitable for oscillating, intermittent contact mode imaging in air. Use AFM probes, for example, as listed in the Table of Materials. Here (depends on AFM), fix the tip in the holder under a clamp by tightening the clamp screw (finger tight). Insert the tip holder into the AFM measurement head. Rest the head on its back for this step.\nPlace the AFM measurement head on top of the sample. Details depend on the AFM model. Here, make sure the head stands stably with its legs inside the stage indentations. Make sure the mica is located on the stage where the AFM tip will hover directly above it. Micrometer screws on the right of the stage allow for fine positioning of the sample.\nAlign the AFM laser on the back of the cantilever for optimal signal strength from the position sensitive photodetector onto which the laser is reflected. Details depend on the AFM model.\n\t\t\nHere, turn the wheels at the right side and back of the AFM measurement head to adjust the x- and y-positions of the AFM laser to direct it centrally onto the end of the cantilever. Watch the reflection signal in the AFM video window (if available, here: press the camera icon and chose input: Svideo).\nOnce crudely positioned, optimize the detector sum signal (Sum in Sum and Deflection Meter window in AFM software) by fine tuning the laser position with the two wheels (stay at the end of the cantilever, the sum signal depends on the AFM and cantilever type, here: aim for sum >5).",
    "Zero the difference signal from the top and bottom diodes of the detector array (here: Deflection signal in Sum and Deflection Meter window) by directing the AFM laser reflection onto the detector center (here: turn the wheel at the left side of the AFM measurement head).\n\t\tNOTE: Deviations from zero then indicate the deflection of the cantilever due to surface interactions, which are translated into height information by the AFM.\nDetermine the cantilever resonance frequency by a frequency tune implemented into the AFM software (here: command auto tune in Master Panel/Tune window). Choose an amplitude corresponding to 1 V input for the piezo that drives the cantilever oscillation. Set the oscillation frequency to slightly (5%) lower than the resonance frequency and zero the phase of the oscillation.\nApproach the tip to the sample surface using the crude engage mode (here: command Engage in Master Panel window) until the protective setting (set-point) is reached. Use ~2% cutting of the free level oscillation amplitude as the set-point (here, enter Set Point 980 mV in the Master Panel).\nFine-engage the AFM tip with the sample surface by lowering the set point using the AFM software. Aim for repulsive mode imaging with the cantilever oscillation phase (Phase in Sum and Deflection Meter window) just below the free level phase (before engage, here typically ~70). Here, use typical final set points on the order of 70-80% of the free level amplitude (1 V).\nBefore scanning, choose the signals for recording in the Master Channel Panel. Choose height (Ht) and amplitude (Am).",
    "Begin sample scanning (here: command Do Scan in Master Panel window). Use a scan speed of e.g., 2.5 µm/s (command Scan Speed in Master Panel) to image surface areas of 4 µm x 4 µm or 8 µm x 8 µm (enter Scan Size in Master Panel) with pixel resolutions of 2,048 or 4,096 (Scan Points and Scan Lines in Master Panel), respectively.\nSave the image file (command Save Image in Master Panel) with no fitting modifications (choose None in Master Channel Panel/Save Plane Fit).\nFor further analysis, process the saved image. Load the image (command Browse Saved Data in the AFM Analysis menu). Open the Modify Panel (press M in the top section of the image). Apply a planefit in x and y dimensions to the height image (extension HtR) (command XY in Planefit window in Modify Panel, choose Planefit Order 3). Then flatten the image (command Flatten in Flatten window in Modify Panel) choosing Flatten Order 3.\nExport the image as a TIFF file (press Commands in top section of image, choose TIFF Export 2x corresponding to 2,048 pixel resolution) for further analysis.\n3. AFM Analysis\nProtein complex volume\nPre-select relevant protein-DNA complexes by direct visual inspection of the images in the AFM software, using a suitable color scheme to maximize different appearances of different size complexes (see different colors and sizes of different complexes in Figure 2; here: color scheme SeaLandAndFire in the AFMsoftware). For XPD samples, possible complexes included XPD/p44-DNA as well as XPD-DNA and p44-DNA, with distinctly different sizes due to the relatively large, different molecular masses of XPD (~95 kDa) and p44 (~40 kDa).\nMeasure volumes of individual protein peaks on the DNA to verify the complex type. This can be achieved with different image software (here: the section tool of the AFM software).",
    "Measure the height (h) and diameter (d) of the protein peak sections with the section window cursors. Measure the diameter close to the base of the particle section.\nDetermine the volume (V) of the peaks using simple mathematical models, e.g., using the following formula, which is based on a spherical cap model:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55501/55501eq2.jpg\nTranslate measured volumes into an approximate protein molecular mass.\n\t\t\nInitially, calibrate the AFM system for volume to molecular weight (MW) conversion using a range of proteins with known molecular weight (here: a total of 12 experiments with between 25 and 851 data points each were conducted on 5 different proteins in monomeric, dimeric, trimeric, or tetrameric states) 4,19,20. Deposit and image proteins (as described above, in 2.2 and 2.3) and measure their volumes as described above (3.1.2). Plot the volumes over their known molecular weights. The resulting graph will show a linear relationship between V and MW, the equation for which can be obtained by a line fit to the data. For the AFM system used here, the following relationship was obtained19:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55501/55501eq3.jpg\n\t\t\tNOTE: This step does not have to be repeated before each measurement, but is only done once. The volume to MW calibration can be applied to images obtained under similar imaging conditions using AFM probes with slightly varying diameters.\nBased on their measured volumes (3.1.2) and the V-to-MW calibration (3.1.3.1), determine the approximate MW of the protein complexes20, which provides information on its molecular content. E.g., for XPD/p44 samples, ~50 kDa, ~100 kDa, and ~140 kDa were obtained, consistent with p44-DNA complexes (or peaks caused by mere DNA superstructure), XPD only peaks, and XPD/p44 peaks, respectively.\nProtein complex positions on DNA\nDetermine the DNA fragment lengths.",
    "Trace the DNA fragments in the AFM images, e.g., with the freehand line function of a suitable image analysis software (see for example Table of Materials) and measure the length of the line.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Exclude DNA aggregates as well as fragments cut off by the image margins.\nBin and plot the DNA lengths from the entire experiment in a histogram, using suitable data analysis and graphing software (e.g., see Table of Materials).\nFit the length distributions with a Gaussian curve in the data analysis and graphing software to determine the length of the DNA fragments. In order to know the position of the inserted DNA target site (see 1.1), only include DNA fragments with the correct length within two standard deviations from the center of the Gauss curve (y = y0 + z exp(-2(x-xc)2/w2), where z is a norm factor and xc and w are the center and full maximum half width of the Gaussian) in further analyses.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The DNA length at the center of the Gauss curve must be close to the theoretical length of the DNA fragment (calculated using 0.34 nm/bp). Lengths of up to 10% shorter than the theoretical value are typical and are likely caused by AFM resolution limits.\nDetermine positions of protein peaks on DNA substrates.\n\t\t\nMeasure the distance of the protein peaks from the closer DNA fragment end, as described in 3.2.1.1 and divide by the total DNA length to obtain distances in units of fraction of DNA length.\nBin and plot the measured distances in a histogram using a suitable data analysis and graphing software (see e.g., Figure 3). As a rule of thumb, choose a bin size that gives approximately √n bins for n data points.",
    "NOTE: Since DNA ends cannot be distinguished here, plot only to fraction of DNA length 0.5 (center of DNA fragment). Because DNA end binding is not the focus of the study, exclude DNA ends from the analyses by starting to bin the position data slightly after position 0 (e.g., here: binning from a DNA length fraction of 0.02).\nDetermine the target site specificity from protein complex position distributions.\n\t\t\nFit the maximum (enhanced binding occurrences) in the position distribution with a Gauss curve as in 3.2.1.3 but footed on the height of background binding (see Figure 3).\nCalculate the specificity S for the specific site versus the nonspecific DNA background (protein molecules bound to non-specific DNA sites) with the following formula21\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55501/55501eq4.jpg\n\t\t\tAsp: Number of specific complexes (area under the Gaussian curve)\n\t\t\tAnsp: Number of nonspecific complexes (area of the background, i.e. (fraction DNA length) x (average background height y0); the fraction of DNA length covered here is 0.48 for a histogram starting at 0.02 DNA length)\n\t\t\tN: number of possible DNA binding sites (here: N = 914 excluding DNA ends)\nDNA bend angles\nUsing the angle tool in a suitable image analysis software, measure the angle β between two lines placed centrally along the DNA backbone and centering at the protein peak (see e.g., inset in Figure 4). Measure the angles for a statistically relevant number of protein-DNA complexes (>50, ideally >100)2,3,5.\n\t\tNOTE: The DNA bend angle is defined as 180°-β2,3,5.\nUsing data analysis and graphing software (see Table of Materials) produce a bend angle distribution histogram by binning the DNA bend angles.",
    "Fit the bend angle distribution with a Gauss curve. If more than one maximum is apparent in the distribution, choose multiple peak Gauss fit. The center(s) of the Gaussian curve(s) give(s) the average bend angle state of the particular species.\nIf a shift in the bend angle(s) (maxima of Gaussian fit(s)) is apparent for distributions, for instance, of different protein variants or different protein complex species, apply a student t -test to evaluate the significance level of the changes.\nSubscription Required.
