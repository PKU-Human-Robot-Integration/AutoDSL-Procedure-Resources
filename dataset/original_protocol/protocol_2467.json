    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAddition of fluorescent dyes and cell seeding\nTiming: 45–60 min\nThese steps describe the preparation of cells, the seeding and the following addition of the fluorescent dyes to the cells.\nDilution of U-2 OS cells for seeding of one 384 well plate.\nWash the cells in a T75 flask once with 5 mL PBS buffer.\nDetach the cells using 3 mL trypsin and determine the concentration and viability of the cells using trypan blue 0.4% solution.\nMix 10 μL cells and 10 μL trypan blue and add to a counting slide for automated cell counting.\nPut the counting slide into the TC20 Automated Cell Counter.\nCount the unstained (live) and stained (dead) cells.\nWait till the results appear on the Cell Counter screen.\nViability of the cells should be higher than 95%.\nDilute the cells to 3 × 104 cells/mL and a final volume of 16 mL/384 well plate or the cell concentration determined in your preliminary experiment for a confluence ranging from 50%–90% after 48 h.\nNote: For a 384-well plate format and 50 μL per well, the cell concentration range is typically between 2–4 × 104 cells/mL (1,000–2,000 cells/well). Depending on the cell type and experimental setup this can be adapted using the steps described above see optimize cell seeding density[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2].\nAddition of the fluorescent dyes to the cells.\nAdd to the 16 mL cell suspension prepared in step 1c:\n57 μL of a 16.23 μM stock of Hoechst33342 (final assay concentration of 60 nM).\n8 μL of a stock of BioTracker™ 488 Green Microtubule Cytoskeleton Dye.\n12 μL of a 100μM stock of Mitotracker red (final assay concentration of 75 nM).\n93 μL of a stock of Annexin V Alexa Fluor 680 conjugate.",
    "Note: Using different fluorescent dyes than the ones mentioned here, can potentially lead to bleed-through problems. For the here described protocol, the overlapping of fluorescence emission spectra is neglectable for all dyes but the MitoTracker Red and Annexin V Alexa Fluor 680. However, this overlap does not influence the analysis, since the excitation maxima of these two dyes are well separated and the gating. See also (Tjaden et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nMix gently by inverting the cell suspension.\nTransfer 50 μL of the cell suspension with fluorescent dyes prepared in step 2 to the corresponding wells of the 384 well plate using a multichannel pipet and a reagent reservoir. The plate layout can be found in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nPipett 100 μL PBS buffer or water in the outer wells as indicated in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nNote: This step helps avoiding edge effects due to evaporation (see problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nRemove any air bubbles that may have been formed during pipetting (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). This step can be performed using an ethanol bottle where a straw-like nozzle is positioned above the ethanol surface within the bottle. Gently press air on the surface of the cell dilution in the wells to remove the air bubbles.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2100-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Debubbler\nExample illustration of air bubble removal.\nPut a lid on the plate prepared in steps 3–6 and leave it for 30 min under the cell culture hood at room temperature to allow reattachment of the U-2 OS cells to the plate.\nIncubate the plate for 18–24 h at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nFigure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] Debubbler. Example illustration of air bubble removal.",
    "Critical: Ensure an even and reproducible distribution of cells within the wells. Image acquisition should ideally be performed in the center of the well to ensure the best coverage of the well area. Uneven distribution of cells within a well can at a later point impede the statistical analysis (see problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).\nPause point: The following steps will be conducted the next day.\nImage acquisition of non-treated cells\nTiming: 3–4 h\nThis step describes the image acquisition of the non-treated cells. The resulting data serve as a baseline for the statistical normalizations (see evaluate your data[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.9]).\nSwitch on the CQ1 microscope and the separate laser module.\nWait 3 min for the laser to heat up.\nEnsure that the environmental controls regulating temperature, CO2 partial pressure as well as the water reservoirs in the CQ1 microscope and the plate incubator are functioning.\nThe temperature of the CQ1 microscope should be kept stable at 37°C.\nThe partial pressure of CO2 should be set to 5%.\nThe humidity should be set to 100% to avoid evaporation (see problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nPlace the plate prepared in steps 3–6 in the CQ1 and open the imaging software using either the associated automation unit or manual handling.\nOpen the measuring protocol, described in the section determination of channels and scan parameters for imaging protocol[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.4].\nAssess if the measuring protocol provides focused images of sufficient intensity in all channels.\nChoose randomly approximately 10 wells spread over the entire plate.\nTest if the focus area and channel parameters can detect the cells and fluorescent signals of the different channels (see problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11]).\nMeasure the plate once with non-treated cells using the described protocol.\nPut the plate into an incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2 until compound treatment.",
    "Note: The time between the measurement and the compound treatment should be as short as possible.\nCompound treatment\nTiming: 30–60 min\nThis step describes compound treatment of the cells.\nUse the Echo® source plate (see preparation of compounds and plate layout[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3]) prepared in step 7 to add the compounds to your plate.\nUse the ‘‘Pick list’’ program in the Echo® 550 liquid handler system to aliquot the correct volumes of the inhibitors and DMSO into each reaction wells in the assay plate (see 9–13 in preparation of compounds and plate layout[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3]).\nOpen the “Pick list” program for the Echo 550 system on your computer.\nSelect “new” to create a new protocol.\nEnter for the source- and destination plate the right Sample Plate Format (384LDV) and the right Sample Plate Type.\nFor DMSO as a solvent use 384LDV_DMSO as plate type.\nNow you can import your picklist, which should be saved as “.csv” on your local storage space.\nCheck your layout again on “plate preview”.\nAfter adding the compounds, centrifuge the plate for 3 min at 100 × g.\nImage acquisition treated cells\nTiming: 24–48 h\nThis step describes the image acquisition of the treated cells over a defined time.\nMake sure that the CQ1 microscope is prepared as described in steps 8 and 9 of Image Acquisition of non-treated cells and place the plate in the CQ1.\nOpen the measuring protocol used for the acquisition of the non-treated cells (see image acquisition of non-treated cells[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2]).\nNote: For image acquisition of treated cells, the same measuring protocol should be used as is for non-treated cells. It is important that the same cell area will be imaged and therefore robust baseline values can be calculated.\nTest the measuring protocol with the inserted cell plate.",
    "Therefore, scan 3–5 wells to test if the focus area of the initial baseline measurement is still appropriate (see problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11]). If the CQ1 cannot detect the cells, the plate might not be placed properly into the machine or there was a problem while pipetting (e.g., air bubbles occurred).\nDefine Scan Schedule and Frequency of your testing. Here, we measure the plate 12 h, 24 h and 48 h after compound treatment (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2100-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. General time schedule\nSchemed time schedule of one plate, which is measured before compound treatment and 12 h, 24 h and 48 h after compound treatment using the CQ1 confocal microscope.\nTo free instrument time of the CQ1 microscope, the plate can be also transferred to an incubator (37°C, 5% CO2).\nData analysis CellPathfinder software\nTiming: 4–5 h\nThis step describes the image analysis using the CellPathfinder software (Yokogawa) and is specific to the CQ1 microscope. Similar high-content microscopes with their own built-in software for analysis or open-source analysis software should be compatible with this protocol, however will require hard- and software related adaptation. For more comprehensive instructions regarding the Pathfinder software, consult the Yokogawa’s product specialists and technical documents. The resulting data and processed images will be evaluated afterwards (see evaluate your data[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.9]) to obtain a phenotypical annotation of each tested compound. The protocol we used to analyze U-2 OS cells “CellPathfinder_AnalysisProtocol_U2OS_Multiplex” can be found here: Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6415330[href=https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6415330].\nNote: The generated protocol is specific to the cell type and magnification. Experiments with different components will require generating a new protocol.\nOpen the CellPathfinder software (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2100-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

    "(D) Algorithm used to detect nucleus and cell body, as well as example images.\nIn the Data tab you can see the measurement details of your experiment.\nOpen the data you want to analyze first.\nOpen the folder on your computer where you saved the CQ1 measurement data.\nSelect the data that you want to analyze first.\nConvert the CQ1 image data by clicking “convert”.\nIt is recommended to create an analysis for each cell line individually.\nOpen the Protocol tab and click on “Load” and select the analysis protocol for U-2 OS cells “CellPathfinder_AnalysisProtocol_U2OS_Multiplex”.Now you can go step by step through the parameters by clicking on the process buttons at the top of the operation window (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nOpen the “Channels” section. We are using 6 different channels (CH) (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B), based on our study design. The brightfield is used twice.\nCH1: Hoechst33342 (DNA detection): Ex 405 nm/Em 447/60 nm.\nCH2: BioTracker™ 488 Green Microtubule Cytoskeleton Dye (tubulin stain): Ex 488/Em 525/50 nm.\nCH3: MitoTracker red (mitochondrial mass detection): Ex 561 nm/Em 617/73 nm.\nCH4: Annexin V (apoptosis marker): Ex 640 nm/Em 685/40.\nCH5: brightfield, DCP Fluor Type Simple Mode, Contrast 0.06.\nCH6: brightfield, DCP Phase Type Simple Mode, Contrast 0.04.\nChannels 5 and 6 are set on DCP to create the best digital phase contrast (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nNote: The “fluortype” setting of the digital phase contrast (DPC) in CH5 provides better segmentation of the cells against the background while the phase setting in CH6 can be used to generate high contrast cell images for visual inspection or publication figures.",
    "For both digital phase contrast channels, two Z stacks should be used to be overlaid and get the best contrast image to detect cellular shape. Here, we used Top Z 5 and Bottom Z 3. Depending on the plate, these Z stacks might differ.\nFor Object assembly open “Object”. Here we created 2 different objects (“Nucleus” and “Cell body”).\n“Nucleus”: Ex 405 nm/Em 447/60 nm, Finder: Nuclear, Recognition: Advance.\n“Cell body”: brightfield, Finder: Cell, Recognition: Advance.\nA process based on the defined objects was created (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D). The aim of the algorithm is to detect cellular shape “Cell body”, based on the brightfield and cell nuclei “Nucleus” based on fluorescent signal of the Hoechst channel. For the Cell body we used the brightfield channel with the fluor-type (CH5).\nThe Nuclei and the Cells are linked in the “Link” section.\nIncluded nucleus in cell body.\nOne in one (1:1).\nTo proceed with the protocol in the CellPathfinder software, you have to first pre-analyze your data. This step includes image processing and object detection and is inevitable to later use the machine learning-based functions for the cellular gating. For an easier and faster workflow, you can pre-analyze just wells with reference compounds important for training of the machine learning (ML)-based functions as well as non-treated cells (see preparation of compounds and plate layout[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3]).\nThe pre-analyzing of important wells should secure the detection of cell bodies as well as cell nuclei. Check if the cell bodies and nuclei are correctly detected in 5–10 example wells.\nClick on “Pre-Analyze” and select the wells including the reference compounds (N5 to N12 and O5 to O12) (see preparation of compounds and plate layout[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3]).\nAfter pre-analysis, the ML based gating algorithm can be trained by opening the “Gate” section.",
    "All features we used can be found in the Table S2 (Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/record/7092795#.YyhponZByUk[href=https://zenodo.org/record/7092795#.YyhponZByUk]).\nThe machine learning based workflow of the analysis is shown in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2100-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Workflow of machine learning based analysis using the CellPathfinder software\nThe cell bodies and cell nuclei are detected in the pre-analysis of the software. Afterwards the machine learning based algorithm can be trained based on the reference compounds (see preparation of compounds and plate layout[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3]). With the trained protocol, the whole plate and all time points can be analyzed based on the tree principle explained in Tjaden et al. (Tjaden et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nNote: To detect the phenotypic changes based on healthy nuclei, a tree principle is used. For a detailed explanation on the gating principle and all features used, see (Tjaden et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nThe cells will be gated first into the categories Hoechst High Intensity Objects “HighIntObj” or normal cells “Normal”.\nAll cells that are gated “Normal” will then be gated into cells containing a healthy nucleus “HealthyNuc”, a pyknosed nucleus “PyknoNuc” or a fragmented nucleus “FragNuc”.\nA pyknosed nucleus can either appear due to mitosis or apoptosis. Thus, cells with pyknosed nuclei will be gated further into “mitosis” or “apoptosis”.\nTo investigate the phenotypic properties of interest (tubulin effect, mitochondrial mass increased, membrane permeabilized), cells showing a healthy nucleus will be gated further in “tubulin effect” or “tubulin normal”, “mito mass high” or “mito mass normal” and “membrane permeabilized” or “membrane intact”.\nUse the reference compounds with known phenotypes to train the machine learning -based analysis (see Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]).\nFor each gating step, individual cells (minimum 10 images) are selected to serve as an example for the gating phenotype (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]). This can be done by a trained scientist or the example images provided here can be used.",
    "imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2100-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Machine Learning based algorithm training images\nFor every gating step, 10 example images of the chosen cells are shown here. The images show the most relevant fluorescent channels for the related gating step. The cells were selected by a trained scientist.\nAfter selecting the example images for the ML-based analysis, safe your analysis and run it once on all other wells containing reference compounds.\nEnsure that the example images worked appropriately to create a robust analysis by comparing the results of all reference compound treated wells (see problem 9). The results should be consistent with the known biological mode of action of the reference compounds and should not differ from each other by more than 10%.\nIf you are sure that the machine learning-based analysis has been well trained (no deviation of the results of the reference compounds by more than 10%), the whole plate can be analyzed.\nYour results in from of separated csv files can be found in the folder containing the data under “…\\PFAnalysis” from where it can then be further evaluated (see evaluate your data[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.9]).\nOptional: Generation of processed images\nTiming: 2–3 h\nThis is an optional step.

    "Timing: 1 h\nThis step describes how to document the generated data so it can be evaluated automatically in the next step. For preparation of your computer refer to preparation of the data analysis workflow[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.5].\nVisit the “root path” (see preparation of the data analysis workflow[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.5]) on your computer.\nOpen the metadata template file found here: Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6325622[href=https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6325622] (excel file with multiple sheets) called “metadata_template.xlsx”.

Make sure to fill the column “cq1 analysis available in folder”; this can be a local, absolute path on your computer (e.g., “C:/Users/CQ1/experiment/PFAnalaysis/timestamp_protocol/\") or can be indicated relative to the “root path” (e.g., “../../experiment/PFAnalaysis/timestamp_protocol/”).\nNote: This cannot be a network path. If necessary, copy the files from a network path to your computer. See also Section “data analysis CellPathfinder software[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.5]” above.\nThe sheet “exclude from file list” is only relevant if you want to deposit your data. In that case, you can omit individual processed images from the autogenerated file list.\nIn the sheet “compounds”, describe all compounds you used in the experiment, e.g., with their chemical structure formula as SMILES. It is recommended to include InChIs, too.\nIn the sheet “compound batches”, list all specific batches of the compounds you used. Information may include internal identifiers and supplier lot numbers.\nEach experiment is linked from the sheet “experiments” to a specific “compound map”. This “compound map” describes the compound batches in individual wells, as discussed in Section “compound treatment[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3]”. Example:\nLet us assume that you entered “multiplex1” as the value of “compound map see corresponding excel table” on sheet “experiments”.",
    "Create (or rename) a compound map sheet to “compound map multiplex1”. If you entered “multiplex2”, you should name it “compound map multiplex2”.\nIn the sheet “compound map multiplex1” (or alike), fill out information about the concentration of the compound and of your intent, i.e., its experimental type:\n“blank”: a well with 0.1% DMSO.\n“cells only”: a well without any addition apart from cells.\n“chemogenomic candidate”: a well with a compound to be tested.\n“control”: a well with a reference compound.\nOptional: If you want to deposit your data, fill out “raw data available in zip file” and “processed images available in folder”, but relative to the folders in BioImage Archive (see also Section “optional: deposit your data[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.8]” below).\nSave the file under a name which will be denoted “METADATA_FILENAME” below.\nPerform automated checks on the file to make sure that it is intact: Open the Anaconda Prompt and enter:\n> python quality_control_of_excel_file.py METADATA_FILENAME\nMake sure to replace “METADATA_FILENAME” with the corresponding filename.

If you do not see any error messages, your file is ready for the next steps.\nOptional: Deposit your data\nTiming: Multiple days, depending on your upload rate\nThis is an optional step. However, we strongly recommend depositing your image data into a public repository, preferentially EBI’s BioImage Archive (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/bioimage-archive/[href=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/bioimage-archive/]).",
    "Zip each folder of collected raw data. Each folder is typically a single timepoint of a single plate with a size of 160 GB.

This information can be used to filter down to entries of interest by standard spreadsheet software.\nThe cell counts in each row are automatically compared to the mean of all wells in the same plate at the same timepoint marked as “blank” according to their “experimental type” (see “document your data[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.7]”). This allows you to judge whether the phenotype is unique to the compound or generic to the experimental setup.",
    "As an example, we have implemented the ratio of the cell count per well for cells annotated as “healthy” and the mean of cell counts for cells annotated as “healthy” across all wells containing 0.1% DMSO (i.e., the “blank”). You can use this metric as a rough proxy of cytotoxicity.\nCompare the values of interest for individual “blank” rows against the mean of all “blanks”. This gives you a feeling for “natural distribution” of values for an “uninteresting” effect.\nNote: Taking the sample data provided with this protocol, the range of values for the ratio of healthy cells (described in the step above) is approx. 0.6–1.2 for individual “blank” rows, with an average of approx. 0.9 and a standard deviation of 0.3. You can use this information to define thresholds to alarm you on “interesting” compounds.\nWe also implemented a measure on “relative growth”, comparing information from individual wells with compound-treated cells against the mean of “blank” wells.\nNote: More measures can easily be implemented in the Python script by interested researchers. You are also invited to contact the authors of this protocol.\nThe “relative growth” was calculated by the following equation (Hafner et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]):\n  r e l a t i v e  g r o w t h =  2   log 2  (   a t x   a t 0   )    log 2  (   b t x   b t 0   )     − 1  \na = normal cell count compound.\nb = normal cell count DMSO 0.1%.\ntx = timepoint of interest.\nt0 = timepoint after 0 h.",
    "We defined threshold values (see Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]), that will mark a compound with a comment. If a compound is marked in more than one cell line it should be flagged and the property should be evaluated in the context of the compound (target, concentration, IC50 etc.).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2100_4.csv"
