    "1. Instrument setup\nSelect the instrument or object to be imaged. In this experiment an ultrasonic scaler was imaged. Cavitation bubbles occur around the tips of ultrasonic scalers in water.\nSelect a micro positioning stage for the instrument to be imaged with XYZ translation and rotation. Place on a laboratory jack. Attach the instrument handle to the micro positioning stage\nSelect an optically transparent water container for imaging. The container used in these experiments was created with glass microscope slides.\nSelect an XY stage with a rotation platform. Place on a laboratory jack. Place the water container on the stage and fill with filtered water (reverse osmosis or distilled).\n2. High-speed camera setup\nSelect a high-speed camera with the desired frame rate and resolution and a high intensity light source with a fibre light guide.\nAttach a micropositioning sliding plate to the high-speed camera body and connect it to a tripod stand.\nSelect a lens with the desired resolution and focal length and attach this to the camera. For this experiment a zoom lens was used at a resolution of 8.4 µm/pixel.\nFill the imaging tank with water and position the tip of the instrument to be imaged in the water tank in the desired orientation.\nAfter connecting the camera and loading the live view in the software, use low magnification to focus on the tip of the ultrasonic scaler, repositioning the light source if necessary. Position the instrument and the light source in front of the camera and focus. Adjust to the desired frame rate and brightness.",
    "NOTE: A higher light intensity is required for imaging at high frames rates, short shutter speeds and/or high magnifications. Illumination can be provided in reflection mode or transmission mode. In this protocol the illumination is provided in transmission mode (bright field) using a high intensity cold illumination device.\nSet an optimal frame rate and shutter speed for the high-speed camera. In this experiment the frame rate was 6400 fps with a shutter speed of 262 nanoseconds. A short shutter speed is required for fast moving bubbles such as cavitation bubbles to ensure that they are in focus.\nAdjust the magnification of the zoom lens and the intensity of the light source so the background is white without being overexposed.\n3. Calibration\nRecord the position of the tip (rotation in x-y stage, rotation angle of instrument for reproducibility).\nTo ensure the field of view is consistent for each repeat, choose a reference point and note down the coordinates. In this case the reference point was the tip of the ultrasonic scaler. It can then be repositioned in future experiments in the same place within the field of view.\nIf the pixel size is unknown, image a graticule with 10 µm markings at the set magnification and use image analysis software such as Fiji to calculate the resolution.\n4. High-speed video recording\nImage the instrument without cavitation. This will be subtracted from the cavitation images in image analysis when calculating the area of the cavitation bubbles. Save the videos in a format such as TIFF so no image quality is lost.\nImage the instrument operating with cavitation. Ensure there are sufficient frames for accurate analysis, for example 5 repeats with 500 frames each.\n5. Image processing",
    "Download Fiji19 from the ImageJ website (https://imagej.net/Fiji). An ImageJ macro code has been provided which automatically does the image analysis steps described below and can also be changed to suit the application. The individual steps of the macro are described in steps 5.3-5.5.\nCrop the image to remove any darker areas resulting from uneven illumination, if needed. Ensure that all images are cropped to the same size and at the identical point in the image.\nConvert the images to binary by automatically thresholding using one of the auto thresholds. In this example the minimum auto threshold is used.\nRun the fill holes command to remove any black pixels from inside the bubbles which were falsely segmented.\nCalculate the histogram of the stack to show the number of pixels corresponding to the scaler and the cavitation in each frame.\nIn this case the pixels corresponding to the bubbles are white and have value 255. Save these measurements.\nRepeat steps 5.3-5.6 for the video of the instrument operating without the bubbles.\nCalculate the mean area of the ultrasonic scaler tip only from the results of the histogram.\nSubtract the mean area of the instrument from each of the areas calculated from the videos of the bubbles around the scaler. The area of the bubbles is left to measure.\nVisualize by subtracting the binary image of the scaler from the binary image of the scaler with bubbles using the image calculator in Fiji.\nCalculate the mean and standard deviation of the area of the bubbles.",
    "Convert the values from number of pixels to area (in this case µm2) by multiplying by the pixel size squared. Calculate the size of each pixel by imaging a graticule with the high-speed camera at the same magnification as was used for imaging and use ImageJ to set the scale.\nPlot the data. It is also possible to conduct statistical analysis to show any significant difference in the area of bubbles if comparing different conditions.\n6. ImageJ macro\nIn the ImageJ/Fiji menu, go to Plugins > New > Macro. Ensure IJ1 Macro is checked under the language menu and copy and paste the following code. Click run to execute the macro (Supplementary File)."
