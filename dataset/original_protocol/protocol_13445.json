    "The present human surgery protocol is approved by and follows the ethical guidelines of the Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University (Guangzhou, China). Informed consent was obtained from the patient for the release of information and data related to his treatment.\n1. Preoperative preparation\nProhibit patient from eating for 8 h and drinking for 4 h before surgery.\nUse general anesthesia with tracheal intubation2. Treat patient with conventional sterilized skin and sterile towel sheets after adequate anesthesia is performed by an anesthesiologist.\n\t​NOTE: Disinfect the surgical area with iodophor three times.\n2. Surgical technique\nPlace the patient in supine position with legs divided, head high, and feet low, and the right side tilted at 15°.\nEstablish the pneumoperitoneum by the pneumoperitoneum needle2 (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: The pneumoperitoneum pressure is set to 13 mmHg.\nMake a 1 cm curved incision along the lower margin of the umbilical cord and puncture a 10 mm trocar, and then insert the laparoscope (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Puncture trocar of 5, 12, 5, and 12 mm to the left under the xiphoid process, 4 cm below the rib cage in the right midclavicular line, intersect the left midclavicular line with the transverse umbilical line, and intersect the left anterior axillary line with the transverse umbilical line, respectively.\nPerform abdominal exploration by entering the abdominal cavity to observe and evaluate the feasibility of LPS.\n\tNOTE: Preliminary assessment content: the spleen size and degree of peripheral adhesion.\nFree the greater omentum by lifting the greater omentum and transverse colon, and use an ultrasonic knife to free the greater omentum along the edge of the transverse colon toward the pylorus, starting in the middle of the greater curvature of the stomach.\nOpen the gastrocolic ligament, and release the gastrosplenic ligament.",
    "Lift the stomach, separate, and expose the splenic artery through the back of the stomach at the superior margin of the pancreas. Separate the splenic artery and the superior pole branch of the splenic vein near the spleen (Figure 2).\nTurn the spleen to the right and the splenic diaphragmatic ligament and cut part of the splenorenal ligament with an ultrasonic knife (see Table of Materials) to expose the upper pole of the spleen fully.\nClamp the superior pole branch of the splenic artery with a \"Pug\" vascular blocking forceps to block blood flow to the superior pole of the spleen and observe the ischemic line to confirm that the mass is within the limits of the ischemic splenic resection (Figure 3).\nPerform a secure ligation using non-absorbable polymer ligation clips (see Table of Materials) to disconnect the superior pole branches of the splenic artery and splenic vein.\n\tNOTE: Separate, expose, clamp, and disconnect the lower pole branches of the splenic artery and splenic vein when performing partial resection of the lower pole of the spleen.\nPlace an 3.5 mm (10 Fr) disposable single-cavity rubber catheter (see Table of Materials) over the main trunk of the splenic artery at the site of dissection to serve as a vascular occlusion band to allow for blockage if necessary.\nPerform coagulation and ablation using a bipolar radiofrequency hemostatic device (see Table of Materials) along the ischemic line on the surface of the spleen (Figure 4).\n\tNOTE: Preferences settings: LAP MODE, Power: 120 W.\nAfter establishing coagulation of the necrotic area, dissect the spleen with an ultrasonic knife and observe no significant bleeding during dissection of the spleen (Figure 5) until the mass is removed along with the upper pole of the spleen.",
    "Place the specimen in a specimen bag, and enlarge the incision of trocar puncture at the intersection of the left midclavicular and transverse umbilical lines to 4-5 cm to remove the specimen altogether.\nSuture the incision with a 2-0 absorbable suture (see Table of Materials) and irrigate the abdominal cavity.\nAfter confirming that there was no active bleeding in the abdominal cavity, place absorbable hemostatic material (see Table of Materials) on the surgical wound, and then place the adhesive membrane.\nPlace a laparoscopic drainage tube (see Table of Materials) at the medial edge of the splenic portion and exit from the left lower abdomen.\nSuture all 5 mm and 12 mm trocar holes layer by layer.\n3. Postoperative care\nClosely observe and record vital signs in the first 24 h postoperatively by continuous real-time electrocardiograph (ECG, see Table of Materials) monitoring.\n\tNOTE: Vital signs: heart rate, blood pressure, respirations, and pulse oximetry.\nAdminister an intravenous antibiotic (cefazolin sodium, 1.5 g with 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution, 12 h) for 24 h postoperatively to prevent infection.\nStart liquid diet after 6 h postoperatively and ensure bed rest for 24 h.\nRemove the catheter 24 h postoperatively.\nRemove the drainage tube 48~72 h postoperatively."
