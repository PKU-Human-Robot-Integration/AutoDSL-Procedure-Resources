Diagram of Study Paradigm  Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52600/52600fig1large.jpg]\n1. Surgical Preparation of the Swine\nAdminister 5-7mg/kg of tiletamine/zilazipam to the swine (70-80 kg) via intramuscular injection. Place an ear vein catheter and administer 5-7 mg/kg methohexital via intravenous access. Intubate the animal with endotracheal tube and ventilate.\nDeliver isoflurane >1.2% MAC in a mixture of house air and oxygen to maintain a surgical plane of anesthesia. Ensure the animal is in a deep plane of anesthesia prior to any manipulations by checking for the absence of jaw tone and keeping the anesthesia above the minimum alveolar concentration for swine. Initial anesthetic depth check is conducted by assuring the absence of jaw tone and the isoflurane levels are monitored continuously throughout the procedure (>1.5 MAC) to ensure a deep plane of anesthesia.\nCarefully access the right external jugular and carotid artery with cautery and blunt dissection. Place an 8.5F Swan-Ganz catheter in the external jugular and inflate the balloon to 1.5 cc. Then traverse through the right atrium, into the ventricle and through the pulmonic valve down the pulmonary artery until a wedge pressure is felt.\nDeflate the balloon and leave the catheter in this position. Record the right atrial pressure and pulmonary artery pressure using the balloon. Additionally, record the wedge pressure or pressure in the lung (or if the lungs are considered normal, then also record the left atrial pressure).  \n\tNOTE: This catheter also allows for estimates of the cardiac output.\nPlace an additional 5.0F balloon pressure catheter in the external jugular and into the right ventricle to continuously record pressure.",
    "Place a 5.0F balloon pressure catheter in the carotid artery, prolapse through the aortic valve and maintain in the left ventricle. Flush all pressure catheters with 20 units/ml heparanized saline connected to a pressure transducer, and record all pressure data from the left ventricle, right ventricle (and estimated cardiac output), pulmonary artery pressure and right atrial pressure.\nFor peripheral monitoring, access a branch of the femoral artery by placing an 18F catheter for real-time blood pressure or blood gas monitoring. Record heart rate and temperature during the procedure.\nCarefully access the left external jugular with cautery and blunt dissection. Place two 11.0F hemostasis introducers in the jugular and secure with 0 silk sutures. Place steerable catheters in the introducers.\nUnder fluoroscopic guidance, place active fixation leads in the right atrial appendage and the apex of the right ventricle.\n\tNOTE: A fixation lead is a surgically implanted wire that connects the heart to an implanted pacemaker.\nConnectanalyzer cables to the leads and test for capture utilizing a programmer. Set the parameters to 8V, 0.25 msec duration, and set the pacing rate at a minimum of 10 bpm higher than the intrinsic rate at that time. Record the relative impedance for each lead.\nMake a medial surgical incision from the xiphoid process to near the insertion of the sternocleidomastoid muscles. Use a sternal saw to remove the anterior protrusion from the sternum (keel bone) to enable the partial medial dissection of the sternum. Use a shear cut through the remaining portions of sternal bone structure. Dissect the sternal-pericardial ligament and retract the sternum.",
    "Use blunt dissection to separate the pericardium from the pleural linings. Make a medial sagittal incision (3-5 cm) in the pericardium and create a pericardial cradle with four square knot sutures at each corner (right, left, superior and inferior sites).\nPlace a temporary bipolar lead in the apical region of the left ventricle and place a unipolar plunge temporary pacing lead into the left atrial appendage.\nEuthanasia is accomplished by removal the heart under deep anesthesia.\n2. Preparation for Electrophysiological Monitoring\nCardiac Mapping System.\n\t\nSelect an AF study in a cardiac mapping system Connect the ventricular epicardial bipolar pacing leads and the epicardial leads in the atrial appendage with alligator clips to the appropriate settings in the breakout box. Connect an EKG and ground pads to the system.\nOscilloscope and Grass Stimulator.\n\t\nConnect the bipolar left ventricular pacing lead and unipolar atrial lead in the breakout box to a Grass stimulator which is connected to an oscilloscope for electrical verification.\nProgrammed Electrophysiological Stimulation.\n\t\nSecure the right atrial leads and right ventricle leads in a pacemaker Place the programmer telemetry head over the pacemaker. Select the pacing electrode stimulation (PES) study and set the parameters to 8V; remove all patient parameters. Set the pacing duration set to 8 pulses at 400 msec (or 300 msec).\n3. In Situ Study\nRefractory Period: Study Paradigm.\n\t\nDetermine the atrial effective refractory period (AERP), atrial ventricular node refractory period (AVNERP) and the ventricular effective refractory period (VERP) at baseline, and at 30 and 60 min post pericardial delivery of compound/drug/control treatment; additional time points may be added as desired.\nRefractory Period: Programmer Settings.",
    "Burst induce the PES study parameter to 8 paces (400 msec or 300 msec) followed by a minimum of 300 msec pacing. Reduce the pacing until the ventricles/atrium (respectively) fail to contract. This is noted from the sensing of the pacing leads; thus determining the relative refractory period.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52600/52600fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. EnSiteSystem: AERP, AVNERP and VERP Determination  Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52600/52600fig2large.jpg]\nDetermination of Relative AF Burden: Parameters.\n\t\nSustain the animal’s heart in AF, after 1 min, allow it to remain in AF for up to 10 min: i.e., before shocking the atria with direct paddles at 5 joules to terminate AF. Elicit AF induction up to 10 times at each time point. Note, in this study. AF is defined as an erratic rhythm with an absence of the P wave.\nAF Burden: Grass Stimulator and Oscilloscope Settings.\n\t\nOptimize the parameters for the Grass stimulator to deliver 4 Hz with a 2 sec pulse duration to the left atrial appendage (LAA) via the plunge pacing lead; verify this by a standard oscilloscope. Deliver a single pulse to the LAA to induce AF.\n4. Heart Explantation and Reanimation (Transplant Model)\nAortic Root Cannula.\n\t\nCarefully dissect the pericardial tissue around the ascending aorta and remove the pericardium.Suture two points (2-3 cm apart) of 2.0 Ethibond suture in the ascending aorta, and administer 30,000 units of Heparin intravenously.\nPlace the aortic root cannula between the suture points and secure the aorta. With the delivery system pressurized, remove the stylet-bevel and place a clamp on the cannula not allowing for flow.\nCardioplegia Preparation.",
    "Administer cold St. Thomas cardioplegia solution into the ascending aorta under a pressure of 150 mm/hg via a pressurized bag. Secure an irrigation catheter that is attached to the pressurized cardioplegia with a 3-way stop cock on the distal end. Secure the stop cock to the aortic root cannula, release a steady flush of cardioplegia through the catheter and secure to the aortic root cannula.\nCross-Clamp.\n\t\nClamp the inferior vena cava with an atraumaticclamp 1-2 cm just superior to the diaphragm. Clamp the ascending aorta with atraumatic angled camp 1-2 cm on the ascending aorta superior to the aortic root cannula.\nCross-Clamp/Cardioplegia.\n\t\nRemove the clamp from the aortic root cannula and flush the cardioplegia at 150 mm/hg toward the aortic valve, closing the aortic valve and perfusing the coronaries.\nClamp the superior vena cava and make a small incision in the pulmonary artery, so as not to over pressurize the heart. Once the heart is stopped (asystolic), excise and remove heart from the chest and place in a bath of cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer (~3-8 °C).\nReanimation.\n\t\nCannulate the great vessels and prepare the heart utilizing Visible Heart methodologies (3). Once the perfused heart reaches 37±5 °C, restore a native sinus rhythm by delivering 34 J shocks to the ventricles via epicardial patch electrodes.\n5. In Vitro Study Paradigm\nContinuously monitor cardiac function for 60 min post reanimation. Continuously monitor echocardiography in 2D mode with a short-axis view: an LV view just below the mitral valve.\nCalculate ventricular wall thickness and ejection fractions every 10 min post reanimation (see below). Take samples from the coronary sinus (1 cc) at -5 min and every 5 min during the evaluation period.\nMonitoring.\n\t\nMonitor the hemodynamics for both the left and right ventricles, including pressures, flows and volume changes.\nEchocardiography: Ejection Fraction.",
    "Place a transthoracic echo probe directly on the heart, capturing a mid-papillary short-axis view. Calculate the ejection fraction (EF %) in 4-chamber working mode every 10 min using the equation: LV End Diastolic Volume − LV End Systolic Volume X 100/LV End Diastolic volume\nEchocardiography: Left Ventricular Wall Thickness.\n\t\nMeasure ventricular wall thickness (cm) from a mid-papillary short-axis window at 10 min intervals for an hour post reanimation. Measure four corners of the left ventricle using a screen calipers and take the average.\nMyocardial Metabolism.\n\t\nPlace a steerable catheter in the coronary sinus (CS). Sample 1 cc from the CS 5 min before reanimation and every 5 min post reanimation for 1 hr. Test the samples for lactate and glucose levels; other blood gases can also be assessed.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
