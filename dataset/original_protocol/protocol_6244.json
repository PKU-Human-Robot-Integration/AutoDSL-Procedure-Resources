    "Construction of pHW2000-PA-AP tagThe PA-AP segment was constructed by inserting a sequence encoding the short linker GSGG (Nucleotide sequence: GGTTCAGGAGGC), a 15-amino acid biotin AP tag (Nucleotide sequence: GGTCTGAACGATATCTTCGAGCTCAGAAAATCGAATGGCACGAA), and a duplication of 165 base pairs of the 3ʹ end of the PA-coding region after the PA ORF (stop codon deleted) using one-step sequence and ligation-independent cloning method (Jeong et al., 2012). Schematic of pHW2000 PA-AP tag is shown in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190914/20190914042923_8544.jpgFigure 1. Schematic of the constructed plasmid pHW2000 PA-APPCR amplification and gel purification of linearized vector fragmentThe linearized vector fragment (pHW2000: 2,980 bp, partial PA sequence: 1,368 bp) is amplified using the KOD FX DNA polymerase enzyme in a PCR machine, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Reaction system (Table 1) and parameters (Table 2) are shown as follows:Table 1.

In addition, load the 2 kb Plus DNA ladder for size verification.Run the gel in 1x TAE until the bands of the loading dye run to approximately three quarters of the way down the gel. Visualize the PCR product on a UV transilluminator. Cut the ~4,300 bp band using a clean blade. Place the gel slice into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.Purify the PCR product using the Omega gel extraction kit as per the manufacturer's protocol. Elute the linearized vector fragment PCR product with 50 μl elution buffer.",
    "PCR amplification and gel purification of insert fragmentAcquire the insert fragment (partial PA sequence: 895 bp, linker-AP tag: 45 bp, and duplicated packaging sequence of PA gene: 205 bp) through a 5-steps PCR procedure. For a flow chart of these steps see Figure 2.Firstly, amplify duplicated packaging fragment from PA gene with Insert-F1 and Insert-R1 primers.Then duplicated packaging fragment is used as the template to amplify AP tag-duplicated packaging fragment with Insert-F2 and Insert-R2 primers.The same linker-AP tag-duplicated packaging fragment can be acquired in the third step.Partial PA fragment is acquired from PA gene using Insert-F4 and Insert-R4 primers in the fourth step. Finally, the linker-AP tag-duplicated packaging fragment and partial PA fragment are fused together and amplified using Insert-F5 and Insert-R5 primers by overlap extension PCR.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190914/20190914043427_2661.jpgFigure 2.

Elute the Purified PCR product (~1,200 bp) with 50 μl elution buffer.One-step sequence- and ligation-independent cloningMix the linearized vector fragment and insert fragment at a molar ratio of 1:2 in a 1.5 ml tube. Reaction system is shown in Table 3.Table 3. Reaction system of One-Step sequence- and ligation-independent cloningimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190914/20190914043455_6422.pngAdd 0.5 μl of T4 DNA polymerase (3 U/μl, NEB) to the mixture and incubate at room temperature for 2.5 min. Then, put the reaction mixture on ice immediately and incubate for 10 min. At the same time, thaw chemically competent cells DH5α (200 μl) on ice for ~10 min.Gently mix the cells with 10 μl of the reaction mixture and incubate the cells on ice for 30 min. Heat shock the cells at 42 °C for 90 s.",
    "Incubate the cells on ice for 2 min. Add 800 μl of LB medium to the cells and transfer the cells to 15 ml glass tube. Incubate the cells at 37 °C for 1 h. Then plate the cells on agar plates containing ampicillin antibiotics. Normally, we spread 200 μl of culture onto an agar plate. Incubate the plates upside down at 37 °C for 16 h.Pick six colonies and inoculate each into LB medium supplemented with ampicillin in 15 ml glass tubes. Grow overnight in a 37 °C rotating incubator. Extract plasmid DNA from the above cultures using the Omega Plasmid Mini kit as per the manufacturer’s protocol.Sequence clones with PA-F and PA-R sequencing primers to confirm the proper insertion of linker-AP tag-duplicated packaging sequence into the pHW2000-PA backbone.The resulting plasmid is herein referred to as pHW2000-PA-AP tag.Rescue of infectious recombinant rPR8-PA-APTransfect the cells with rPR8-PA-AP rescue plasmids.Transfect 293T cells in Opti-MEM as per the manufacturer’s protocol for 6-well plate, and the following per well:2 x 106 293T cells1 μg pHW2000-PB21 μg pHW2000-PB11 μg pHW2000-HA1 μg pHW2000-NP1 μg pHW2000-NA1 μg pHW2000-M1 μg pHW2000-NS1 μg pHW2000-PA-AP tag16 μl Lipofectamine 20001.5 ml Opti-MEMIncubate the transfected cells for 6 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.

Centrifuge the supernatant for 1 min, 19,419 x g to remove cell debris.Rescue rPR8-PA-AP from transfection supernatantsInfection of 10-day-old chicken embryonated eggs Candle the 10-day-old eggs using a light egg candler in a darkroom to mark the interface between the air sac and the allantoic cavity. Make a hole with a 10 ml syringe needle in the eggshell.",
    "Inoculate each egg with 200 μl of the tissue culture supernatants using a 1 ml syringe. Cover the hole in the eggshell with melted wax, then incubate the infected eggs at 37 °C for 3 days.Prior to harvesting the allantoic fluid, incubate the chicken eggs overnight at 4 °C to kill the embryo and coagulate the blood.Clean the eggshells with 70% ethanol and open the embryo over the air cavity by tapping with a spoon. Remove the broken eggshell and allantoic membrane with forceps. Stabilize the chicken embryo and collect as much allantoic fluid as possible into a 15 ml centrifuge tube on ice by a 1 ml pipette. Centrifuge for 5 min, 19,419 x g at 4 °C and transfer the allantoic fluid to fresh 15 ml centrifuge tubes. Store the allantoic fluid at 4 °C until they are checked for the presence of rescued virus with a hemagglutination (HA) assay.Note: For more information about this process, please watch the jove video (https://www.jove.com/video/2057/generation-of-recombinant-influenza-virus-from-plasmid-dna[href=https://www.jove.com/video/2057/generation-of-recombinant-influenza-virus-from-plasmid-dna]). Chicken eggs are SPF-level eggs. Infected-eggs are discarded in autoclavable bags and autoclaved following standard procedures. (Martínez-Sobrido and Adolfo García-Sastre, 2010)HA assaysHA assays are carried out in V-bottom 96-well plates. Add 50 μl of 1x PBS into each well of the V-bottom 96-well plate.Add 50 μl of allantoic fluid to the first well and make 2-fold serial dilutions for the following wells. Discard the extra 50 μl from the last well.Add 50 μl of 1.0% chicken red blood cells (prepared in 1x PBS) to each well.Incubate the V-bottom 96-well plate for 30 min (until a red dot is visible in the bottom) at RT. A positive viral rescue can be confirmed by HA assay (Figure 3).",

Using a 200 μl pipet tip, stab the plaque and scrape the cells forming the plaque. Inoculate each plaque into 500 μl of infection medium.Detect and sequence PA-AP gene from the plaques by RT-PCR using the OMEGA Viral RNA kit and TaKaRa one step SYBR PrimeScript PLUS RT-PCR Kit with PA-F and PA-R primers following the manufacturer’s protocol.
