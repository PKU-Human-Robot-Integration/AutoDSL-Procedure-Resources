    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nBehavior test and video recording\nTiming: 3 h\nThis section aims to record the courtship behaviors of wild-type Canton S flies, aged 6–8 days old. The recorded videos will be utilized in the subsequent section for behavior analysis.\nNote: Behaviors in fruit flies are regulated by circadian rhythms, and thus, the time of day for conducting the tests should be kept consistent to avoid any potential confounding effects.\nSet the room temperature to 25°C.\nTurn on the light source to optimize the brightness suitable for the recording device.\nBring the flies and courtship chambers to the behavior testing room.\nNote: Allow a minimum of 30 min for acclimation in the testing room.\nTurn on the camera to initiate recording, preferably at a frame rate of 50 frames per second (fps) or higher. Camcorders with a resolution of 1080p are suitable for recording all behaviors analyzed in the Behavior Analysis section, with the exception of VPO and OE. For capturing VPO and OE, camcorders with a resolution of 4K are recommended.\nPair a single female and a single male fly in the courtship chamber. The choice of using virgin or mated females depends on the purpose of experimental design. The selection of type 1 or type 2 chambers depends on the specific behaviors to be recorded.\nUse the aspirator, with a brief inhale, to draw a single male fly from the group-reared vial, while ensuring that the fly does not escape.\nUse the same aspirator to collect a single female fly from the isolation tube, while ensuring that the fly does not escape.\nCover a courtship chamber with an acrylic sheet, and connect the aspirator and courtship chamber through the hole in the acrylic sheet.",
    "Hold the aspirator vertically, allowing the flies to climb upward into the courtship chamber.\nNote: A light source from above can be used to accelerate the climbing speed.\nReplace the acrylic sheet with a transparent coverslip to enable video recording.\nNote: Block the hole in the acrylic sheet with a finger to prevent flies from escaping while replacing the acrylic sheet with the cover glass.\nPlace the covered courtship chamber under the recording camera.\nRepeat step 5 according to the number of planned tests. A 1080p camcorder can capture up to 32 (4 × 8) chambers. A 4K camcorder for VPO and OE behaviors can record up to 6 (2 × 3) chambers.\nContinue recording for 1 h after the last chamber has been initiated.\nStop recording, and transfer the video files to a computer for analysis.\nNote: Refer to Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] for critical steps in video recording.\nCritical: Ensure that the testing room is quiet and free from any vibrations.\nCritical: Anesthesia should be avoided for the flies at least 48 h prior to the courtship behavior testing.\nPause point: Videos can be stored on disk and analyzed later according to the researcher's behavioral analysis schedule.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S1. Behavior test and video recording, related to step-by-step method details steps 4–7\n    \nBehavior analysis\nTiming: 1–3 days\nIn this section, the previously recorded videos will be analyzed to quantify female receptivity using multiple parameters. The neural mechanisms that control the sexual receptivity of female flies have recently been the focus of investigations, with different parameters used in various articles. In this study, we will use six parameters to quantify female receptivity in detail.",
    "While the genotypes of female flies to be tested are different, we always pair them with wild-type males. With a short delay after pairing, males court females until copulation occurs. Copulation rate and latency to copulation are two parameters to quantify the courtship success, and reflect female receptivity in terms of the outcome of the courtship process.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]\nSuccessful copulation depends on dynamic interactions between male and female flies. When paired with a female, a male fly exhibits stereotyped courtship behaviors, including following, wing extension, proboscis extension, abdomen bending, and copulation attempts. Courtship index3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] is the parameter used to measure male’s courtship attempts. When pursued by a male fly, a female fly pauses4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] to wait for the male, and exhibit either VPO to accept courtship and initiate mating, or OE to reject courtship and prevent mating. The events of VPO and OE are quantified to reflect the willingness of females to accept courtship.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5],6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nReplay the videos and visually analyze related parameters as the following. The start time of each pair is when the chamber is placed under the video camera.\nAnalyze the outcome of courtship behaviors in 1 h.\nCopulation rate is the percentage of pairs successfully mated within 1 h to the total number of pairs tested.\nLatency to copulation is the time interval from pairing to copulation.\nAnalyze courtship attempts of male flies in the first 5 min.\nCourtship index is the percentage of time of males’ displaying courtship behaviors, including following, wing extension, proboscis extension, abdomen bending, and copulation attempts.\nAnalyze the behaviors of females in the first 10 min.\nFrequency of pausing is the number of times that a female pauses when pursued by a male fly.",
    "Frequency of OE is the number of times that a female pauses and displays OE when pursued by a male fly.\nFrequency of VPO is the number of times that a female pauses and opens its vaginal plate when pursued by a male fly.\nCritical: A normal resolution (40–60 pixels in length, 15 pixels in width, or ∼500 pixels in area per fly) and type 1 chambers are sufficient for most parameters. To visualize VPO and OE, a higher video resolution (180–200 pixels in length, 55 pixels in width, or ∼9000 pixels in area per fly) and type 2 chambers are needed.\nNote: Examples of the behaviors described above are shown in Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2].\nCopy data to GraphPad Prism for data analysis and plotting.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S2.
