    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparing the staining plate and controls\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThis step describes the method to immunolabel primary cells in preparation for flow cytometry using antibodies and dyes. Here we provide optimized antibody dilutions for up to 106 primary MNCs based on the instrumentation we have worked with. However, it is important to titrate and optimize antibody concentrations for each instrument. In addition, any alternative fluorophores and antibodies used for cell surface staining should be tested for compatibility with this fixation and permeabilization protocol. Data shown in this protocol were generated using a BD X-20 Fortessa analytical flow cytometer. The antibody dilutions used likely provide a good starting point and are within similar ranges of the dilutions recommended by the manufacturers.\nIn a standard FACS tube, prepare cells for all control samples (unstained, single-antibody stained, and antibody-deleted). Controls can be prepared using a mixture of MNCs from all conditions, or PBMCs from healthy donors can be used in control samples after spiking in human myeloma cell lines known to express CD138, CD38, and other myeloma antigens (e.g., H929 or RPMI-8226 cells). Troubleshooting 1\nWash cells in 2–3 mL of STM.\nBased on the total number of fluorophores in the panel, prepare a single-stained compensation control sample and a Fluorescence minus one (FMO) antibody-deleted sample for each fluorophore (e.g., 7 single-stain and 7 FMO samples, plus one unstained control and one full stain = 16 controls). We recommend starting with approximately 2–4 million cells resuspended in 2 mL of total STM, which should be divided amongst the control wells (e.g., 3 × 106 normal PBMCs plus 1 × 106 spiked in H929 cells). Mix cells well by pipetting.",
    "Aliquot a target quantity of 1 × 105–2.5 × 105 total cells per control well in a volume of 100 μL per well.\nAlternatives: As an alternative to using normal PBMCs and cell lines as controls, compensation beads (e.g., ThermoFisher UltraComp eBeads Plus Cat #01-2222-42) can be used for single-color compensation controls. Use one drop of compensation beads for each single stain control and add corresponding antibody to each control. Detailed instructions can be found in the “Product Sheet: UltraComp eBeads Compensation Beads and UltraComp eBeads Plus Compensation Beads[href=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/MAN0019374_UltraComp_eBeads_and_UltraComp_eBeads_Plus_Compensation_Beads_PI.pdf].”\nDispense cells for control samples into the appropriate number of wells required for each of the above stains within the first two columns (1 and 2) of a 96-well deep-well round (U)-bottom plate.\nAlternatives: Standard FACS tubes can be used in place of a 96-well plate for the rest of the protocol (e.g., polystyrene tubes, Corning Cat# 352003). The incubation volumes outlined for staining in a plate will also be compatible with tube-based staining and are designed to be low-volume to help conserve antibody reagent use. However, if higher incubation volumes are preferred for tube-based staining, antibody incubation steps can be scaled up to a final volume of 100 μL (in which case all antibody volumes and total incubation volumes should be increased × 1.67). If performing staining in FACS tubes, all wash steps may also be increased in volume (2–3 mL buffer per wash), and additional reagent volumes will also be needed for fixation and permeabilization steps.\nPlate at least 1 × 105 cells (but no more than 1 × 106) per well for each experimental sample, with roughly equivalent numbers of cells per sample. Troubleshooting 2",
    "Centrifuge the plate for 5 min, 300 × g at 4°C. Visually verify the presence of a cell pellet in the bottom of each well after centrifugation.\nDiscard the supernatant by holding the plate firmly in one hand and then rapidly (but carefully) dump off the supernatant by inverting the plate while using a single quick plunging motion to discard the waste over a bucket containing 10% bleach. When the plate is turned back over, a small residual volume of buffer should remain in each well.\nAlternatives: If FACS tubes are used instead of a microwell plate, use an aspirating pipette to remove the supernatant individually from each tube. Be sure to avoid touching the cell pellet while aspirating.\nGently vortex the plate, with the plate lid on, to loosen cell pellets into residual wash buffer.\nCritical: All subsequent centrifugation steps should include a visual verification of the cell pellets in the bottom of the plate, rapid discarding of the supernatant, and gentle vortexing of the plate to loosen the cell pellets. When dumping off the supernatant, do not hold the plate in an inverted position for more than a brief moment needed to rapidly dump off the supernatant. For subsequent steps, these detailed instructions will be abbreviated, but should still be followed.\nOptional: In order to ensure the reproducibility and accuracy of the quantitative data obtained from samples analyzed using this protocol, we recommend including technical replicates of each sample. However, due to the inherent variabilities in working with primary material, sometimes this is not possible. We have previously observed a high degree of reproducibility between technical duplicate samples using this protocol and anticipate that a single well may be considered representative of an individual sample.",
    "Note: With regard to designing the plate layout for your experiment, if there is sufficient room on the plate, we recommend leaving an empty column between controls and each column containing experimental samples (e.g., single-stains in column 1, FMOs in column 3, and experimental samples in columns 5, 7, and so on). This helps prevent potential cross-contamination between wells and reduces potential errors that could occur during plating and antibody addition steps. The use of individual FACS tubes for staining is another option to help eliminate any concern about potential cross-contamination between samples. Note that this may increase the time required for staining and washing the samples if >10 samples are being stained at one time.\nStaining with live/dead dye\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step stains the cells with a fixable Near-IR dye to discriminate live/dead cells.\nAdd 300 μL of PBS (not STM) to each well using a multichannel pipettor, pipetting up and down to resuspend and wash.\nCentrifuge the plate for 5 min, 300 × g at 4°C. Discard supernatant and gently vortex the plate to dislodge cell pellets.\nDilute Near-IR live/dead dye 1:1000 in PBS to a volume of 100 μL per sample for all samples, plus an excess of at least 10% (100 μL × # of samples × 1.1).\nDiluted dye can be transferred to a small reservoir to facilitate multichannel application of the solution to the wells.\nAdd diluted Near-IR dye to all the appropriate samples (do not add to unstained well, FMO Near-IR well, or any single-stain wells, other than for Near-IR single-stain).\nPipette up and down 2–3 times to thoroughly resuspend cells.\nIncubate plate(s) in the dark for 30 min at 20°C–25°C.",
    "Add 300 μL of STM and centrifuge plate for 5 min, 300 × g at 4°C. Discard supernatant and gently vortex the plate to dislodge cell pellets.\nCritical: Ensure that you wash the cells with PBS before staining with Near-IR live/dead stain, as the presence of FBS can interfere with the dye activity. Refer to the Near-IR live/dead kit technical data sheet for supplemental guidance on reagent preparation and use.\nStaining for cell surface antigens\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step immunolabels the cells for surface antigens to distinguish between myeloma and normal immune cell populations.\nDilute Human FcR block 1:25 in STM, making enough for 30 μL per sample plus an excess of at least 10%.\nAll samples receive blocking solution.\nAdd 30 μl of block solution to each sample. A small reservoir can be used to facilitate multichannel pipetting.\nPipette up and down 2–3 times to thoroughly resuspend cells.\nIncubate plate(s) for 20 min in the dark at 4°C.\nDuring the blocking incubation step, prepare antibody master mix as outlined in the Staining Reagent Dilution Chart. Troubleshooting 3\nPrepare a 2× concentrated master mix of surface-stain antibodies, diluting them appropriately in STM, making up enough volume to add 30 μL to each experimental sample plus an excess of at least 10% (30 μL × # of samples × 1.1).\nAdd master mix of surface-stain antibodies to experimental samples receiving the full stain (add 30 μL per sample).\nPipette up and down 2–3 times to thoroughly resuspend cells.\nNote: Do not remove blocking solution before adding staining mix.",
    "Critical: Ensure that single-stain and FMO wells do not receive the cell surface antibody master mix. Also, the IRF4 antibody does not get added into the cell surface antibody master mix, or to any single-stain or FMO controls at this stage, as it will be added after fixation.\nFor single-stain and FMO controls, add antibodies individually at the appropriate dilutions along with STM to bring the total volume of each well to 60 μL.\nWhen performing cell surface staining in combination with intranuclear staining, there will be some wells that receive only STM during the surface staining step (e.g., IRF4 single stain), and all FMOs will not receive IRF4 antibody until after fixation/permeabilization.\nIncubate plate(s) for 45 min in the dark at 4°C.\nAdd 300 μL of STM to each well and centrifuge for 5 min, 300 × g at 4°C. Discard supernatant and gently vortex plate to dislodge pellet.\nRepeat step 20 for a total of two washes.\nCell fixation\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step fixes the cells to facilitate subsequent permeabilization and intranuclear immunolabeling.\nAfter the last wash of the cell surface staining protocol, discard supernatant and gently vortex the plate to dissociate the cell pellets.\nAdd 200 μL of 1× True-Nuclear fixative solution to each well. Gently pipette up and down to ensure all cells are resuspended.\nIncubate at 20°C–25°C in the dark for 50 min (no longer than 60 min).\nCritical: Extended exposure to paraformaldehyde (in the True-Nuclear fixative solution) can destabilize tandem dyes such as PE-Cy7. Do not incubate for longer than 60 min and be sure to store samples in a fixative-free buffer if the protocol is to be paused for 12–18 h (see below).",
    "Note: After fixation, sometimes the cell pellets are more difficult to visually identify in the bottom of the plate after centrifugation. Ensure the centrifuge has completed the run at the appropriate speed before discarding the supernatants after this point.\nCentrifuge plate at 300 × g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C. Discard supernatant and gently vortex the plate to dislodge the cell pellets.\nProceed immediately to Permeabilization and Intranuclear Staining Procedure, or pause the assay and store plate for 12–18 h (see pause point).\nPause Point: (optional) Resuspend cells in 200 μL STM or CytoLast buffer (BioLegend) and store at 4°C in the dark for 12–18 h (no more than 24 h). Wrap sides of plate tightly with parafilm to prevent evaporation, and cover plate in foil to protect from light. To resume the protocol after a 12–18-h pause, centrifuge plate at 300 × g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C, discard supernatant, and gently vortex the plate to dislodge pellets before proceeding with permeabilization and intranuclear staining.\nPermeabilization and intranuclear staining\nTiming: 2 h\nThis procedure permeabilizes the cell and nuclear membranes and immunolabels the cells using an antibody specific for human IRF4. The subsequent staining steps can be carried out at 20°C–25°C. Refer to the manufacturer’s guidelines for additional instructions on carrying out this staining in 96-well plates (https://www.biolegend.com/protocols/true-nuclear-transcription-factor-staining-protocol-for-96-well-u-bottom-plate/4246/[href=https://www.biolegend.com/protocols/true-nuclear-transcription-factor-staining-protocol-for-96-well-u-bottom-plate/4246/]) versus 5 mL FACS tubes (https://www.biolegend.com/protocols/true-nuclear-transcription-factor-staining-protocol-for-5ml-tubes/4267/[href=https://www.biolegend.com/protocols/true-nuclear-transcription-factor-staining-protocol-for-5ml-tubes/4267/]).\nAdd 300 μL of 1× True-Nuclear Perm Buffer to each well.\nCentrifuge plate at 300 × g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C. Discard supernatant and gently vortex the plate to dislodge the cell pellets.",
    "Repeat steps 27 and 28 one more time for a total of two washes in Perm Buffer. Meanwhile, dilute IRF4 antibody in True-Nuclear Perm Buffer (antibody dilution of 1:100), preparing enough volume for 100 μL per sample plus an excess of at least 10% (100 μL × # of samples × 1.1). The diluted antibody can be stored on ice, protected from light, until use.\nBe sure to include FMOs and single stain wells in the dilution calculation.\nAdd diluted IRF4 antibody to all experimental samples receiving the full stain (add 100 μL per sample).\nAlso add diluted IRF4 antibody to the IRF4 single stain sample and all FMO samples, except IRF4 FMO.\nAdd 100 μL of Perm Buffer alone to all other control samples (unstained, other single-stained samples, and the IRF4 FMO well).\nIncubate in the dark at 20°C–25°C for 45 min.\nAdd 300 μL of 1× True-Nuclear Perm Buffer to each well.\nCentrifuge plate at 300 × g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C, discard supernatant and gently vortex plate to dislodge pellet.\nRepeat steps 32 and 33 one more time for a total of two washes in Perm Buffer.\nResuspend cells in 200–400 μL of STM and acquire samples on a flow cytometer equipped with the appropriate laser configuration for the fluorophores utilized. Troubleshooting 4\nOnce staining is complete, samples should be kept on ice or at 4°C, in a dark container or covered with foil to protect from light.\nOptional: If your flow cytometer is equipped with a 96-well plate adapter, prior to acquisition, transfer all samples to a standard 96-well U-bottom plate. If your flow cytometer is not equipped with a 96-well plate adapter, then samples can be transferred to microtiter tubes (multichannel-compatible) or standard FACS tubes for acquisition.\nData acquisition and analysis\nTiming: 2 h",
    "This step processes all samples through a flow cytometer, through which different cell populations can be identified based on their cell surface receptor expression profiles and intranuclear IRF4 protein levels.\nEnsure the flow cytometer being used includes the following lasers:\n405 nm Violet\n488 nm Blue\n561 nm Yellow Green\n633 nm Red\nNote: For our optimization we used a BD X-20 Fortessa analyzer instrument. We have also tested this panel on a BD FACS Aria and obtained similar results. The following steps are a general guide for adjusting the instrument and acquisition settings in the BD FACS Diva program, but standard operating procedures should be used specific to your flow cytometry instrument.\nInitiate and prime the flow cytometer for acquisition.\nUse the unstained control sample to set forward scatter and side scatter voltages.\nUse single-stained controls to set voltages of other fluorophore channels and collect data for compensation. Troubleshooting 5\nCompensation can be performed later on during analysis in FlowJo software.\nAlternatives: Compensation may also be performed through FACS DIVA software while running samples on the flow cytometer. Use standard operating procedures for your flow cytometer.\nUse FMO samples to collect data for negative population gating.\nCollect data from all control and experimental samples after ensuring that all the voltages are set appropriately. We recommend collecting a minimum of 20,000–50,000 cells per experimental sample (10,000 cells is typically sufficient for each compensation control and FMO).\nExport data (FCS 3.0 format recommended) to analyze using FlowJo software.\nNote: If samples are noticeably clumpy or likely to have a high proportion of dead cells, they can be filtered through a cell strainer (35 μm mesh) after staining is complete and prior to acquisition. This will be required for analysis of primary samples on some flow cytometers that are prone to clogging."
