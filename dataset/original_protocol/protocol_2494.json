    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of antimicrobial solutions\nTiming: 60 min\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2129_2.csv\nX: the stock concentration. Xi: the volume of the stock solution at concentration X.\nNote: Use antimicrobial agent solutions on the same day, unless following instructions available on the stability of the solutions under specified storage conditions.\nNote: Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles. These can accelerate the degradation of antimicrobial agents, e.g., β-lactams, or their aggregation.\nPreparation and incubation of micro-dilution trays with antimicrobial agents\nTiming: 18 h for the preparation of micro-dilution trays\nDispense 50 μL of the antimicrobial solutions in each well of micro-dilution trays in triplicates in a descending order.\nNote: Use twice the required concentration of an antimicrobial agent to compensate for dilutions with 50-μL of the prepared bacterial inoculum.\nNote: Use at least three wells with 50 μL each of the MHB and inoculum as a positive growth control and add extra 50 μL of the fresh MH broth to reach 100 μL and at least three wells with 100 μL of the MHB as a negative growth control.\nCombine 50-μL of the prepared inoculum with 50 μL of an antimicrobial agent solution in each well of micro-dilution trays to reach the final inoculum of 5 × 105 CFU/mL (target range, 2 × 105 CFU/mL to 8 × 105 CFU/mL).\nPlace an adhesive seal around the microplates before incubation to prevent the desiccation of the wells. Incubate over 18 ± 2 h at 35 ± 1°C in ambient air.\nNote: Do not exceed four micro-dilution trays in one stack to avoid uneven heating and place a single tight lid on the top of the stack.\nCritical: Use a different 96-well plate for each microorganism to avoid cross-contamination.\nCritical: Use controls for each strain tested.",
    "Note: Store stock cultures of strains used frozen at ≤−60°C. Make working cultures of the strains by sub-culturing the stock cultures on a non-selective nutritive agar medium.\nNote: Use at least two relevant quality control strains every day when testing is carried out. Process these strains in the same way as routine cultures.\nCritical: Use the trays with an antimicrobial agent immediately. If not possible, store the trays before the time the agent starts degrading, as per documented quality control evidence, but no longer than three months (ISO, 20776-1:2020). In this case, seal the trays in plastic bags and place in a freezer (≤ −60°C).\nCritical: MICs against control strains should be within the ranges given in quality control documents by EUCAST or CLSI. The MIC for the control strains should be within one two-fold dilution of the expected MIC (Andrews, 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nViable cell count in micro-dilution trays\nTiming: 18 h to probe viable cell count\nIn parallel with the preparations 1–3, probe the target viable cell count (5 × 105 CFU/mL) on the test suspension.\nTake 10 μL of the culture from the positive growth control immediately after inoculation.\nDilute it (1:1,000) in 10 mL of MHB.\nSpread 100 μL of the obtained suspension over an MHA plate.\nIncubate over 12–18 h.\n20–80 colonies formed indicate an acceptable test suspension.\nNote: All trays should be inoculated within 30 min in order to maintain the viable cell number.\nCritical: If the acceptable suspension of 20–80 colonies is not achieved, restart inoculum preparation.\nData recording\nTiming: 20 min to record the data\nTransfer microdilution trays into a micro-plate reader and take the readings after 18 h of incubation.\nCritical: Readings should only be taken if:\nthere is visible bacterial growth in the positive control (OD625 > 0.009).",
    "there is no visible growth in the negative control (OD625 < 0.009).\nthe inoculum has a viable cell count with no cross-contamination (see step 16).\nRecord the lowest concentration of the agent at which there is no visible growth (OD625 < 0.009).\nNote: Absorbance values qualifying for a minimum inhibitory concentration are up to 0.009 AU (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2129_3.csv\nInterpretations of the results\nTiming: 20 min to analyze the recorded data\nTo analyze the data use reference breakpoints (target and range of concentrations) for a specific bacterium and a specific antimicrobial agent.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2129_4.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2129_5.csv\nNote: Refer to clinical breakpoints set by CLSI or European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) (Tables 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]).\nNote: Breakpoints are concentrations at which bacteria can be identified as susceptible or resistant to a given antibiotic. If the MIC is less than or equal to the susceptibility breakpoint the bacteria is susceptible to the antibiotic. If the MIC is greater than this value, the bacteria is intermediate or resistant to the antibiotic.\nDANAMIC: Automation and data analysis\nData import\nTiming: 5 min to prepare and import data into DANAMIC\nDANAMIC is a bespoke Graphical User Interface (GUI) designed to automate data analysis from Excel data files exported by SoftMax Pro v7.0 from experimental data collected in micro-plate readers. The program is designed to work with Windows 10 and is compatible with any ∗NIX system provided that the libraries are installed correctly (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2129-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. View of the main program window\nPrior to the automated analysis save experimental data in SoftMax Pro as follows:\nOne bacterium strain per plate.\nTwo antimicrobial agents per plate, with concentrations shown from left to right starting with the highest, with each concentration in triplicate, as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2129-Fig2.jpg",
