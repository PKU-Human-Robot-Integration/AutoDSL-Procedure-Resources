    "384-well plate coating (under a biosafety cabinet)Pour Poly-L-Lysine solution at 0.1 mg/ml into a 25-ml sterile pipet basin.Pipet 25 µl of 0.1 mg/ml Poly-L-Lysine solution (using standard sterile tips) and fill up each well of a cell culture treated white opaque small volume 384-well plate.Incubate at room temperature for 15 min with the lid on the 384-well plate (not light sensitive).Remove Poly-L-Lysine from the cell culture plate using the multichannel pipet set to 50 µl.Rinse the 384-well plate twice by pipetting 25 µl of sterile water in each well, remove liquid by inversion.Allow the plate to dry under the biosafety cabinet without the lid on for at least 30 min or until the wells appears to be completely dry (maximum 2 h).Store Poly-L-Lysine-coated plates with the lid on to keep them sterile at room temperature until use (not light sensitive, see Note 1).Cell preparation for transfection (under a biosafety cabinet)Rinse HEK293 cells with 10 ml of 1x PBS by gently pipetting down the PBS on the side of the dish to avoid detaching cells. Remove PBS by aspiration or inversion.Add 1 ml of trypsin 0.25%-EDTA 2.21 mM in each petri dish and ensure that all the area of the dish is covered by trypsin solution.Incubate for 1 min at 37 °C.Add 10 ml of complete DMEM to each petri dish and detach cells by doing up-and-down movements with a 10-ml pipet.Pipet 75 µl of cell suspension to use for counting with the Moxi Z cell counter.Prepare two 10-cm petri dishes containing 3 x 106 cells in 10 ml of complete DMEM per complete 384-well plate to be transfected.Incubate cells at 37 °C in a humidified chamber under 5% CO2 for 48 h.Cell transfection and plating into 384-well plate (under a biosafety cabinet)Prepare transfections, for each transfection (1.",
    "5 µg of DNA for 32 wells):Add 150 µl of Opti-MEM into a sterile 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tube.Add 1.5 µg of plasmidic DNA coding for the desired 7TMR (either wild-type or mutant).Add 3 µl of P3000 reagent.Mix by flicking the tube with your finger to ensure an even distribution of the DNA and P3000 reagent.Add 3 µl of Lipofectamine 3000 reagent and mix by flicking the tube with your finger.Incubate at room temperature for 15 to 30 min to allow formation of the transfection complexes (not light sensitive).Prepare cell suspension for plating using cells prepared in Procedure B (see Notes 2 and 3):Rinse HEK293 cells with 10 ml of 1x PBS as described in Step B1.Add 1 ml of trypsin 0.25%-EDTA 2.21 mM in each petri dish and ensure that all the area of the dish is covered by trypsin solution.Incubate for 1 min at 37 °C.Add 5 ml of complete DMEM to each petri dish and detach cells by doing up-and-down movements with a 10-ml pipet.Pipet 75 µl of cell suspension to use for counting with the Moxi Z cell counter.Prepare 9 ml of cell suspension at 1.5 x 106 cells/ml in complete DMEM for each complete 384-well plate to be transfected into a sterile 50-ml conical tube.Mix the cell suspension gently to ensure an eve distribution of the cells.Transfection and plating of cells:Transfer 700 µl of cell suspension prepared at Step C2 into a 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tube prepared at Step C1.Mix by flicking the tube with your finger.Transfer the content of the tube into a sterile 25-ml pipet basin.Transfer 20 µl of the cell suspension from the pipet basin to the 384-well plate using a 10-100 µl 8 channel multi-pipette.Repeat step d. until two columns of the plate are filled with cells.",
    "Ensure that there is no air bubble trapped at the bottom of the well that could prevent cell adhesion.Repeat the operation from steps a. to f. with other transfections.Incubate cells at 37 °C in a humidified chamber under 5% CO2 for 48 h.IP-One assayReagent preparation (in case of a new IP-One kit):Reconstitute the IP1 Tb Cryptate Antibody with 3 ml of ddH2O, mix by vortexing gently, and prepare aliquots of 50 µl into 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tubes.Reconstitute the IP1 d2 Reagent with 3 ml of ddH2O, mix by vortexing gently, and prepare aliquots of 50 µl into 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tubes.Reconstitute the IP-One–Gq standard with ddH2O according to the tube label, mix by vortexing gently, and prepare aliquots of 25 µl into 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tubes.Store the aliquots of IP1 Tb Cryptate Antibody, IP1 d2 Reagent, and IP-One - Gq standard at -20 °C until use (see Note 4).Agonist preparation (see Note 5):Prepare 7 ml of 1x stimulation buffer by diluting 1.4 ml of 5x stimulation buffer (supplied with the kit) with 5.6 ml of ddH2O into a 15-ml conical tube.Prepare serial dilution of the 7TMR agonist ranging from 10-5 to 10-11 M in 1x stimulation buffer using the first seven rows (A to G) of a V-bottom 96-well plate (dilutions in multiple columns are required to have enough volume to fill the entire 384-well plate).Fill the last row with 1x stimulation buffer (non-stimulated control).Cell stimulation:Remove the cell culture media by inversion of the 384-well plate over a waste receptacle.Wash cells using 25 µl of room temperature 1x PBS in each well using a 10-100 µl 8 channel multi-pipette.Remove 1x PBS by inversion of the 384-well plate over a waste receptacle.",
    "Ensure that all wells are free of remaining liquid (if so, invert and shake gently the plate again until all wells are free of liquid).Add 14 µl of ligand dilution into each well of the 384-well plate using a 10-100 µl 8 channel multi-pipette.Put the lid on the 384-well plate and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C.Preparation of the IP1 standard curve:Prepare the Std 7 solution by adding 425 µl of 1x stimulation buffer into a 25 µl aliquot tube of IP-One–Gq standard and mix by vortexing.Prepare Std 6 by diluting 50 µl of Std 7 into 150 µl of 1x stimulation buffer into a 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tube and mix by vortexing.Prepare Std 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 by repeating the same dilution process as described in b.Std 0 is a positive control and is not a dilution of Std 1 but only 1x stimulation buffer.Dispense 14 µl of each Std solution (from Std 0 to Std 7) in duplicate in a 384-well plate (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200816/20200816235116_6683.jpgFigure 3. Typical arrangement of an assay plate. Wild type receptor-expressing cells (wt) are in columns 1 and 2 and mutant receptor-expressing cells (M1, M2, …, M10) are distributed in subsequent columns pairs except columns 23 and 24 used for IP-One standard curve.Cell lysis and detection reaction:Prepare diluted IP1 Tb Cryptate Antibody and diluted IP1 d2 Reagent by adding 1 ml of lysis & detection buffer 6 (supplied in the kit) to a 50 µl aliquot prepared at Step D1 (1.3 ml of each diluted reagent are necessary for an entire 384-well plate).Dispense 3 µl of diluted IP1 d2 Reagent into each well (including the standard curve wells) of the 384-well plate using a single channel repeater pipette mounted with a new 100-µl combitip.",
