    "This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Thomas Jefferson University and Drexel University College of Medicine. The protocol was approved by the Thomas Jefferson University and Drexel University College of Medicine IACUC.\n1. Animal model\nInsert two 75 mg slow-release morphine sulfate pellets or two placebo pellets subcutaneously in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats.\n\t\nUse a gown and gloves appropriately for minor sterile surgery. Shave the rat dorsum with clippers if necessary.\nApply vet ointment to the animal's eyes. Anesthetize the rat with approximately 20 s of isoflurane inhalation. Anesthesia is confirmed by loss of consciousness.\nMake a midline incision in the rat dorsum with bead-sterilized blunt scissors and separate the dermis from the body wall with a bead-sterilized probe. Insert the pellets under the dermis with bead-sterilized forceps. Suture the incision closed with a sterile needle.\n\t\tNOTE: The entire procedure takes about 5 min per rat. Fresh sterile gloves are used for each rat.\nPlace the rat into an isolation cage for postsurgical recovery. Check for a heartbeat and regular respiratory rhythm. Observe the rat until consciousness is regained. Assess for postsurgical pain.\nAssess the rats 8 h postsurgery and every 12 h after for recovery and infection. Place rats in a cage with the rest of the cohort when they are fully recovered from surgery, about 24 h postsurgery.\nGive an intraperitoneal naltrexone injection (75 mg/kg) to the G and the Withdrawal cohorts following 6 days of morphine exposure.\n\tNOTE: There were four rat cohorts in this representative experiment (see Figure 1).\n2. Sample harvesting\nHarvest the brain 6 days following the pellet insertion or 24 h following the naltrexone injection.",
    "Place the animal in an isoflurane chamber for approximately 30 s or until loss of consciousness occurs, indicated by a lack of motion and decreased respiratory rate.\nUse a sharp guillotine to rapidly decapitate the animal.\nDissect the brain out from the animal's skull.\nUse a sharp handheld razor to make the following gross incisions to the removed brain: First, slice off the cerebellum and discard. Second, separate the brainstem from the forebrain with a transverse incision. Third, hemisect the forebrain and/or brainstem with a midline sagittal incision.\nPlace the forebrain and brainstem into a plastic tissue-embedding mold with 3-4 cm of Optimal Cutting Temperature compound (OCT) in the bottom of the mold. Cover the rest of the sample with OCT.\nImmediately place the plastic tissue-embedding mold with the sample covered with OCT into a bath containing dry ice and methanol. Do not let the methanol spill into the tissue-embedding mold. Keep the embedding mold with the brain sample in the methanol-ice bath until tissue collection is finished (~10-15 min maximum).\nPlace the brain sample into a -80 °C freezer as soon as possible.\nHarvest the gut samples concurrently.\n\t\nFollowing rapid decapitation, make a midline incision in the animal's abdomen with a scalpel.\nFind the cecum and sever its connection to the ascending colon.\nSqueeze the cecal contents into a 15 mL conical tube.\nImmediately place the conical tube on dry ice and put into a -80 °C freezer as soon as possible.\n\t\tNOTE: The small intestine contents can also be collected using the same methods as a negative control.\n3. Slicing\nSlice the hemisected rat forebrain using a cryostat.\n\t\nRemove the plastic embedding mold with the forebrain from the -80 °C freezer and place into a -20 °C cryostat.",
    "Remove the OCT-embedded hemisected forebrain sample from the embedding mold. Use a razor to slice the corners of the plastic embedding mold vertically if necessary. Mount the forebrain for rostral to caudal coronal slicing on a cryostat chuck using OCT.\n\t\tNOTE: Anatomic landmarks to identify the CeA include the optic tract and stria terminalis (Figure 2B). The optic tract branches from the optic chiasm and tracks dorsal-lateral as the brain is sliced rostral to caudal. When the optic tract has a morphology similar to what is seen in a rat brain atlas bregma -2.12 mm10, test slices may be viewed under a microscope. The optic tract and stria terminalis morphology can be checked in a rat brain atlas10 to identify the bregma and whether the CeA surrounds the stria terminals.\nSlice 10 µm thick coronal sections from the hemisected forebrain rostral to caudal until sections containing the CeA are reached.\n\t\tNOTE: The width and height of the sections are approximately 200 mm.\nCollect 10 µm sections containing the CeA, or the preferred brain region, by thaw-mounting 10 µm sections onto plain glass slides. Immediately place the glass slides onto a metal pan resting on dry ice. Put the slides with brain sections into a -80 °C freezer as soon as possible.\n\t\tNOTE: Multiple slices may be placed on the same slide. If using a different cell type stain for slices on the same slide, leave about 100 mm between slices so a hydrophobic pen can be used to separate cell type-specific antibody solutions on the slide. Leave about 20 mm from the edge of the slide on each side of the slice.\n4. Immunofluorescence staining\nStain the forebrain sections for the brain cell of choice (e.g., neuron, microglia, astrocyte, etc.) using immunofluorescence.",
    "Remove one or more slides with 10 µm sections of the CeA from the -80 °C freezer.\nFix the slides with 75% ethanol for 30 s. Remove the excess liquid.\nBlock the slices for 30 s with 2% bovine serum antigen (BSA) in 1x phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Wash 1x with PBS.\nAdd a primary antibody solution to the slide for 2 min. Wash 1x with 2% BSA solution.\n\t\tNOTE: The primary antibody solution is composed of 2% primary antibody, 1% RNase Out, and 96% of same BSA PBS solution for the blocking step above (step 4.1.3). The representative experiment used an anti-NeuN antibody, an anti-Cd11β antibody, and an anti-GFAP antibody in the following quantities: 3 µL of primary, 1.88 µL of RNA inhibitor, and 145.12 µL of BSA solution.\nAdd the secondary antibody solution to the slide for 3 min. Wash 1x with PBS.\n\t\tNOTE: The secondary antibody solution is composed of 1 µL of goat anti-mouse 488 nm fluorescent tag (1:500), 2.5 µL of RNA inhibitor, 1.3 µL of DAPI (1:10,000), and 196.5 µL of 2% BSA.\n5. Ethanol and xylene dehydration series\nDip the slides into 75% ethanol for 30 s. Immediately after, dip the slides in 95% ethanol for 30 s. Immediately after, dip the slides into 100% ethanol for 30 s. Immediately after, dip the slides into a second container containing 100% ethanol for 30 s.\nFollowing the ethanol dehydration series, dip the slides into freshly poured xylene for 1 min. Immediately after, dip the slides into a second container of xylene for 4 min.\nRemove the slides from the xylene bath and let air dry in the dark for 5 min.\nPlace the slides in a desiccator for 5 min to dry further.\n6. Laser capture microdissection",
    "If stained, place the slide into the microscope and find the region of interest (CeA) using anatomic landmarks (i.e., the optic chiasm and stria terminalis).\nUse fluorescence to identify the stained cell type and its nucleus in the region of interest. Choose one cell or multiple cells if doing single cell pooled samples. Mark the cells of interest using LCM software.\nPlace the LCM cap on top of the slice on the region of interest.\nUse test shots of an infrared (IR) laser to adjust the IR laser strength, size, and duration so that the LCM cap adhesive melts only over the area of the selected single cell. This ensures that no other cells will be collected other than the cells selected.\n\tNOTE: In this representative experiment, 10 cell pools of the same cell type were used as a single sample to limit the cell-to-cell variability in gene expression between samples with the same treatment. However, this method can be used for true single cell experiments1,3.\nSelect the individual cells to be collected for analysis using the LCM software tools (Figure 2C). Cells selected must be in the anatomic area of the CeA (or the brain region of choice) based on the rat brain atlas and the bregma10. Cells should be at least 3 µm from the adjacent stained nuclei.\nFire the IR laser to collect the identified single cells.\nPlace the cap in the quality control (QC) station and view it to ensure that only the desired cells were selected. If other cells were mistakenly selected, an ultraviolet laser can be used to destroy the unwanted cells while the cap remains in the QC station.",
    "Take a photo of the tissue section from where the cell was collected to document its anatomic specificity. Record the distance of the slice from the bregma if appropriate using a rat brain atlas as a reference10.\nRemove the LCM cap from the QC station, attach the sample extraction device, and pipette 5.5 µL of lysis buffer onto the sample.\n\tNOTE: The lysis buffer solution consists of 0.5 µL of lysis enhancer and 5 µL of resuspension buffer.\nFit the ExtracSure device onto a 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and place on a hotplate at 75 °C for 15 min.\nSpin down the sample and lysis buffer for 30 s at low speed (0.01-0.02 x g) and place the collected sample into a -80 °C freezer.\n7. Single-cell microfluidic RT-qPCR\nPreamplification of single cell mRNA for 96.96 Dynamic Array Chip\n\t\nCombine the forward and reverse mRNA qPCR gene primers for all the genes being assayed in a primer pool for preamplification (500 nM concentration each primer). For example, 1 µL of 100 µM primers in 80 µL plus 120 µL of DNA Suspension Buffer.\n\t\tNOTE: The primer sequences used for the representative experiment can be found in O'Sullivan et al.4.\nIn a new 96 x 96 PCR plate, add 1 µL of 5x VILO to each well.\nRemove LCM single cell samples from the samples stored at -80 °C, let thaw briefly, centrifuge briefly at a low speed (0.01-0.02 x g), and add 5.5 µL of the lysed single-cell sample to the PCR plate. Each sample is added to its own well.\nPlace the PCR plate with the samples and VILO into the thermocycler and heat at 65 °C for 1.5 min. Spin the plate for 1 min at 1,300 x g at 4 °C and place the plate on ice.",

Run the GE Fast 96 x 96 PCR protocol (30 cycles).\n\t\tNOTE: The RNA quality and validity of the results are assessed by multiple methods, including assay validation via gel electrophoresis, melting temperature curves, sample and assay replicates, and standard dilution series plots. Additionally, transcriptional findings can be validated by independent methods on brain hemisection including Western blot and immunofluorescence assays.\n8.
