    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPFA perfusion\nTiming: 10–20 min\nThe purpose of PFA perfusion is to clear the blood from the vasculature while preserving the vessels to achieve the most optimal staining result.\nNote: For the protocol described here, we use adult mice of 20 weeks of age. Mice that are 6 weeks of age and older can be used, as there is no upper age limit in this protocol. However, for mice younger than 6 weeks of age, the perfusion method needs to be adjusted, which will not be discussed in this protocol.\nAnesthetize the mouse.\nAdminister a lethal dose of Ketaminol and Rompun anesthesia (300 mg/kg ketamine + 30 mg/kg xylazine) via intraperitoneal injection. Inject in the center of the lower quadra of the abdomen at a 45° angle using a syringe with a 30G needle.\nWait until the mouse is completely anesthetized, i.e., has no responses to tail nor to toe pinches (approximately 3–5 min).\nCritical: From this step onward, operate in a chemical fume hood to minimize the possible risks of working with PFA, which is a moderately toxic substance and a carcinogen.\nInsert the intake end of the peristaltic pump tubing into a container with ice-cold 2% PFA and flush the tubing and needle with 2% PFA to expel any air bubbles in the circuit.\nPlace the mouse on its back and pin its four paws to a Styrofoam board to secure the mouse during perfusion.\nSpray 70% ethanol on the fur in the abdominal area to prevent stray fur from sticking to the internal organs.\nGrip the chest skin using blunt forceps and make an incision along the skin using scissors to expose the peritoneum, then, expose the xiphoid, i.e., the piece of arrowhead-shaped white bone using scissors.",
    "Grip the xiphoid with forceps and make lateral incisions on the peritoneum beneath the ribcage using scissors to expose the diaphragm and the liver.\nCut the diaphragm along the entire length of the ribcage using scissors.\nCut the ribcage on both sides up to the collarbone using scissors. Lift and pin the freed sternum with the detached ribcage to the Styrofoam board to expose the heart and the lungs.\nCarefully remove the pericardial sac or other tissues covering the heart using blunt forceps to provide a clear view of the heart.\nInsert the infusion needle attached to the peristaltic pump into the left ventricle at an angle approximately parallel to the midline of the heart.\nCritical: Insert the infusion needle about 5 mm into the left ventricle to avoid penetration into the left atrium or the right ventricle.\nMake a small incision to the right atrium using fine scissors to allow the blood to exit from the circulation.\nStart the perfusion immediately using a peristaltic pump and perfuse the mouse with 20 mL of ice-cold 2% PFA over 2 min. For the peristaltic pump used in this protocol, the speed is set to 41.1 rpm for this purpose. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: Problem 1, Problem 2.\nNote: The peristaltic pump enables better control of the perfusion speed, but manual perfusion with a syringe filled with 20 mL of ice-cold 2% PFA can also be used if a peristaltic pump is not available. In this case, adjust manual perfusion to 10 mL/min.\nNote: Successful perfusion can be determined by a color change in the liver and in the liquid flowing out of the right atrium. As PFA flushes out the blood, the color of the liquid flowing out turns from red to clear, and the liver gradually turns from red to beige.",
    "Stop the perfusion and remove the infusion needle. Remove excess PFA/blood with paper towels and discard the PFA waste according to institutional rules and toxic waste disposal regulations.\nCollecting and cleaning the tissue sample\nTiming: 10–30 min\nThe purpose of this step is to locate the correct area for collecting the tissue sample and clean the lumen of the intestinal sample from mucus and food remains to achieve the most optimal staining result.\nCritical: Operate in a chemical fume hood to minimize the possible risks of working with PFA.\nExpose the abdominal organs by cutting the peritoneal wall from the xiphoid down to the symphysis pubis using scissors.\nCarefully move the liver lobes aside using blunt forceps to provide a clear view of the stomach.\nGrip the stomach with blunt forceps and cut the esophagus and any connective tissues using fine scissors, leaving only the duodenum and the rest of the small intestine attached to the stomach.\nUnravel the small intestine from the rest of the gastrointestinal tract by gently pulling the stomach using blunt forceps and by carefully cutting any mesenteric connective and/or fat tissue using fine scissors.\nUnravel a minimum of 8 cm of the small intestine starting from the stomach and transfer the collected part to a measurement plate.\nNote: Using a measurement plate ensures reproducible acquisition of the sample from the same region of the small intestine. For this protocol, we use a 1 cm long piece of the small intestine that is located between the 4 and 5 cm marks from the beginning of the duodenum (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2695-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Obtaining the tissue sample\n(A) Determining the correct region for the sample using a measurement plate.\n(B) Cutting the tissue sample with extra tissue at both ends.",
    "Place the beginning of the duodenum to the 0 cm mark on the measurement plate and isolate the tissue sample by making incisions at marks 3.8 cm and 5.2 cm (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: Problem 3.\nNote: Leaving an additional 2 mm to both ends provides extra area for handling the tissue during the preparation. These extra ends are removed at a later stage.\nCritical: When handling the tissue sample, grip the sample from the end(s) of the intestinal tube and avoid gripping the sample from the center to keep the villi and vasculature intact.\nFill a syringe with 10 mL of ice-cold 4% PFA, attach a plastic gavage needle to the syringe, and remove any air.\nCritical: It is essential to use a flexible gavage needle to avoid damaging the intestinal wall and the fragile villi inside the intestinal tube during the cleaning procedure.\nGrip one end of the tissue sample using blunt forceps and carefully insert the gavage needle into the lumen of the intestinal tube. Clean the lumen from mucus and possible food remains by flushing the lumen with 5 mL of ice-cold 4% PFA while moving the gavage needle back and forth within the lumen (Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: Problem 1, Problem 2, Problem 4, Problem 5.\nNote: Transferring the tissue sample onto tissue paper can help to keep the sample in place while flushing.\nGrip the other end of the tissue sample using blunt forceps and repeat the flushing as in step 20 (Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nPlace the cleaned tissue sample in ice-cold 4% PFA until dissection. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: Problem 5.\nPause point: The cleaned tissue sample can be stored in ice-cold 4% PFA for up to 1 h before dissection.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.",
    "Methods Video S1. Cleaning the sample, related to steps 20–21\n    \nDissecting, pinning, and fixing the sample\nTiming: 1 day\nThe purpose of this step is to prepare the sample for whole-mount immunofluorescence staining.\nNote: We recommend performing dissecting and pinning of the sample using a dissection microscope to enable a better view of the sample.\nCritical: Handle the fine forceps and spring scissors carefully to avoid damaging the fine tips that bend and break easily. Thus, avoid touching hard surfaces with the tools’ tips, do not drop the tools, and always cover the tools’ tips accordingly after use.\nTransfer the tissue sample to a silicone-coated plate containing ice-cold PBS.\nRemove any remains of the mesentery and/or fat attached to the sample using fine forceps and spring scissors.\nCut off the extra 2 mm from both ends of the intestinal tube to provide straight and even edges for later stages (Methods Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nCut the intestinal tube open longitudinally using spring scissors (Methods Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nNote: It is best to have even and straight cuts on all four sides of the tissue sample. This makes cutting the intestine strips easier in the upcoming phases.\nPin down the tissue sample flat onto a silicone-coated plate so that the villi are facing upwards (Methods Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nPin the four corners of the tissue sample onto the silicone-coated plate with insect pins using blunt forceps. Gently stretch the tissue piece while pinning to ensure that the tissue piece is pinned down as flat and straight as possible.\nCritical: Handle the insect pins with blunt forceps, fine forceps can break easily while handling the pins.\nCarefully remove possible dirt and/or mucus from the villi surface using curved forceps.",
    "Working in a fume hood, remove PBS and add ice-cold 4% PFA to the plate. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: Problem 5, Problem 6.\nCritical: Use enough volume of solutions to completely cover the tissue sample without overflow.\nPlace the lid on the plate and seal the plate using parafilm to prevent the liquid from leaking. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: Problem 6.\nFix the sample in 4% PFA at 4°C with rotation for 16–24 h. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: Problem 1, Problem 2, Problem 5, Problem 6, Problem 7.\nPause point: The sample should be fixed for 16–24 h.\nWorking in a fume hood, remove 4% PFA after the fixation and wash the sample with PBS at 20°C–25°C with rotation for 4 × 30 min.\nCritical: PBS used for washing away the PFA should be discarded as PFA waste from this point onward.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods Video S2. Dissecting and pinning the sample, related to steps 25–27\n    \nBlocking and whole-mount immunofluorescence staining\nTiming: 3 days\nThe main purpose of this step is to stain the small intestine sample using an antibody specific for podocalyxin antigen to visualize blood vessels and an antibody against lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE1) antigen to visualize lymphatic vessels. Podocalyxin is expressed on the luminal surface of the vasculature and is a useful marker for detecting blood and lymphatic vessels in various tissues.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] LYVE1 is a more specific marker for mainly initial (capillary) lymphatic vessels. This protocol has also been used for other stainings using antibodies against vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 2 and 3 (KDR, FLT4), prospero homeobox protein 1 (PROX1), ETS-related gene (ERG), and vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin (CDH5) in the adult murine small intestines.",
    "For permeabilization, remove PBS and wash the sample with 0.3% PBST at 20°C–25°C with rotation for 4 × 30 min. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: Problem 1.\nRemove 0.3% PBST and block the sample in DIM at 20°C–25°C with rotation for 1 h.\nCritical: Blocking time should not be shorter than 1 h to reduce unspecific staining.\nFor immunodetection of the antigens, remove DIM and incubate the sample in primary antibodies (goat anti-podocalyxin, 1:400 and rabbit anti-LYVE1, 1:600) diluted in DIM at 4°C with rotation for 2 days. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: Problem 1, Problem 2, Problem 6.\nPause point: The sample should be incubated in primary antibody mix for 2 days.\nRemove primary antibody mix and wash the sample with 0.3% PBST at 20°C–25°C with rotation for approximately 6 h, changing the solution at least 5 times during this time.\nFor the fluorescence detection of the primary antibodies, remove 0.3% PBST and incubate the sample in secondary antibodies (donkey anti-goat Alexa Fluor™ Plus 488, 1:1000, and donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor™ Plus 594, 1:1000) diluted in PBS at 4°C for 16–24 h with rotation and protected from light. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: Problem 1, Problem 2, Problem 6, Problem 7.\nPause point: The sample should be incubated in secondary antibody mix for 16–24 h.\nCritical: From this step onward, protect the sample from light during longer incubations by, for example, covering the plate with aluminum foil.\nNote: In our experience, the most optimal staining results are achieved using secondary antibodies with Alexa-488 or Alexa-594 conjugates, while staining with Alexa-647-conjugated secondary antibodies may result in poorer staining intensity.\nNote: Centrifuge the secondary antibodies at a speed of ≥17,000 g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C to pellet any aggregates and use only from the supernatant to avoid having speckled staining while imaging.",
    "Remove secondary antibody mix and wash the sample with PBS at 20°C–25°C with rotation for approximately 6 h, changing the solution at least 5 times. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: Problem 7.\nWorking in a fume hood, remove PBS and post-fix the sample with 1% PFA at 20°C–25°C with rotation for 10 min.\nWorking in a fume hood, remove PFA and wash the sample with PBS at 20°C–25°C with rotation for 2 × 15 min.\nPause point: The post-fixed tissue sample can be stored in PBS at 4°C for up to 7 days before mounting.\nMounting\nTiming: 5–30 min\nThe primary purpose of this step is to mount the stained small intestine samples to enable the visualization of the vasculature using a microscope. Thus, it is crucial to mount thinner intestine strips rather than the whole tissue sample to allow for clear visualization of the entire villus vasculature.\nLabel a microscope slide with necessary information about the sample (e.g., stainings, experiment information, sample identification number, etc.).\nUnder a dissection microscope, remove any dirt attached to the villi using curved forceps and reposition the pins using blunt forceps, if needed.\nCut 1-2 villi thick strips from all four edges of the sample using spring scissors (Methods Video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]). See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: Problem 1.\nCritical: The intestine strips should be 1–2 villi thick because strips that are ≥3 villi thick are challenging to mount as they curl more easily and the submucosa can fold on top to cover the villi, which disturbs imaging of the entire villi vasculature.\nPlace a small droplet of Mowiol mounting medium on one side of a microscope slide (Methods Video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]). See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: Problem 1.",
    "Note: It is recommended to avoid using Mowiol mounting medium when imaging samples containing fluorescent proteins, such as those obtained from green fluorescent protein (GFP) or red fluorescent protein (RFP) reporter mouse lines as Mowiol may lead to decreased fluorescence intensity of these proteins. In such cases, it is advised to use an alternative mounting medium.\nTransfer the strips into the mounting medium droplet on the microscope slide using fine forceps (Methods Video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3], Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2695-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Mounting the intestine strips\n(A) Placing the intestine strips into mounting medium droplet on the microscope slide.\n(B) Positioning the intestine strips on the microscope slide.\n(C) Mounted intestine strips.\nPosition the strips to the center of the microscope slide using fine forceps so that two strips are positioned back-to-back (Methods Video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3], Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nGrab a strip from one end and carefully pull it from the mounting medium droplet towards the center of the microscope slide. Ensure that the strip is aligned parallel to the longer edge of the microscope slide as you position it.\nEnsure that all the villi of a single strip face the same direction.\nGrab and pull another strip and position it adjacent to the first strip so that the submucosal side of the strips are in contact while ensuring that the villi face outwards.\nNote: While the back-to-back orientation of the strips helps to save space and keeps them straight during mounting, the strips can also be positioned individually if desired.",
    "Note: It is possible to mount multiple samples on the same slide using this method. However, it is important to work quickly to prevent the mounting medium droplets from drying, and to ensure there is enough space between the samples. Additionally, a large enough cover slip should be used to cover all the samples adequately.\nPlace a cover glass on top of the sample(s) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nFill up the remaining space between the microscope slide and the cover slip with Mowiol mounting medium using a 200 μL pipette. Avoid air bubbles.\nSeal all four edges of the cover glass with nail polish and let dry.\nStore the mounted sample horizontally on a flat surface at 4°C and protect it from light until imaging.\nPause point: The mounted sample can be stored at 4°C protected from light for up to 4 weeks if it is well-sealed. However, it is recommended to image the samples within 3 days after mounting for optimal results.\nNote: Storing the whole-mount samples vertically may cause the mounting medium to leak and lead to the drying of the samples. It is recommended to store the samples horizontally to prevent this from happening.\nImage the samples. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: Problem 2.\nNote: Our laboratory utilizes a ZEISS LSM 780 confocal microscope with ZEN 2012 software, along with either a 10× Plan-Apochromat objective with a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.45 or a 20× Plan-Apochromat objective with a NA of 0.80, both of which are air objectives. We typically image small intestine samples that have been stained with Alexa-488, Alexa-594, or Alexa-647-conjugated secondary antibodies. However, depending on the experimental design, other magnifications, objectives, and fluorophores may be utilized to achieve desired imaging outcomes.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.",
