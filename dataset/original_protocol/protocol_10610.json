    "NOTE: Informed consent was obtained from the patients. Also, this research has been performed in compliance with all institutional, national, and international guidelines for human welfare.\n1. Prepare Computer\nTurn laptop on and connect USB from the DVI2USB Capture Card.\n2. Prepare Monitor\nConnect DVI cable to monitor and PinP to allow the endoscopist to view videos from these screens rather than the computer.\nMake sure the standing monitor is on and is set to DVI.\nConnect PinP to the back of the Olympus system then press the input button on the Olympus system to view the image on the large monitor mounted on the wall.\n3. Laser Diode Driver Setting\nCheck to make sure the laser diode driver is OFF. It should only be turned on a couple minutes before imaging is performed.\n4. Power Strip\nPlug in laptop, processor, laser diode driver, DVI splitter, and epiphan capture card into the power strip.\n5. Run MDE Widefield on the Laptop Desktop\nHit ‘Current Folder’.\nType patient number and initials and press ‘Create Patient Folder’.\n6. Prepare Cap and Filter\nWhen handling filter, always use gloves and Kimwipes to minimize the transfer of oil and debris to the filter. Gauze or alcohol swabs may leave fibers that can interfere with imaging.\nPlace a few Kimwipes onto a table to create a platform to lay down the filter and cap. This disinfected area should be easily accessible to the gastroenterologist during the procedure.\nLay down the filter and cap and keep Kimwipes close by for use during the procedure.\n7. Patient Preparation\nConsent patient on use of VFI and proflavine dye before arriving to endo suite. \nPosition patient for upper endoscopy procedure.\nProceed with standard white-light imaging using a multispectral digital microscope (MDM)7.\n8. Insert and Spray Proflavine",
    "After finishing with white-light imaging, insert and spray proflavine dye over tissue of interest. 1-5 mm should be sufficient depending on the area of the Barrett’s tissue. By spraying the proflavine dye at this step, ample time (at least 1 min) is given for sufficient tissue absorption before VFI. Proflavine, which is covered under an investigational new drug application from the FDA (IND 102,217), is a fluorescent contrast agent that concentrates within cell nuclei shortly after application. Although VFI cannot resolve individual cellular morphology, when the laser diode pans over tissue, the reflected light enables the endoscopist to appreciate overall glandular morphology.\n9. Turn on Laser Diode\nTurn on the laser diode. Do this at least 2 min before imaging begins.\n10. Prepare Endoscope for VFI\nWithdraw the endoscope completely.\nPrior to handling the endoscope, ensure that the assistant has two pairs of gloves on.\nHave the endoscopist hold the endoscope in front of the assistant who is next to the Kimwipe platform detailed above.\nWith Kimwipes, have the assistant cleans the tip of the endoscope. Make sure to clean the front surface gently and also clean a few centimeters along the side of the endoscope for easier handling.\nAfter cleaning, have the assistant dispose of the outer pair of gloves.\nHave the assistant put on the filter. Insert the short cylindrical protuberance on the filter into its complementary hole in the endoscope. Keep the endoscope vertical to aid the process.",
    "Holding the filter in place, slide the cap over the filter and push it down over the tip of the endoscope. Make sure the cap is secure and pushed completely on with the edges flush with the endoscope. Make sure the lip of the cap slightly extends over the tip of the endoscope. Lastly, make sure the filter is still in place and flush with the tip of the endoscope.\n11. Insert the Endoscope Back into the Esophagus and Image\n12. Remove Endoscope from Esophagus\nUsing Kimwipes carefully pull the cap and filter off the endoscope. Throw away the cap and clean the filter for the next case. \n13. Clean Filter\nGently clean the filter with Kimwipes.\nFill a small cup with Cydex and submerge the filter for 12 min. Every few min turn the filter over.\nGently clean the filter with Kimwipes.\nSubmerge filter, this time in sterile water. After 5 min, use a squirt bottle and lightly spray sterile water over the filter.\nPlace filter on a few Kimwipes and let it dry.\nOnce dry, place in storage container in between Kimwipes.\nSubscription Required.
