    "Before the first experiment Manufacture cleaning dish according to plans and microscope stage dimensions (Figure 1C, CAD files in Supplementary Information Appendix B[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20210519/Supplementary%20Information.docx]) in-house, using an on-demand production service (e.g., Protolabs, protolabs.com), or purchase from a commercial supplier (e.g., Neuromatic Devices).Install pressure control box on existing patch-clamp electrophysiology rigThe pressure control box can be built from scratch according to plans presented by Kodandaramaiah et al. (2016). Schematics, instructions, and parts lists are also available for download at autopatcher.org.A cleaning-compatible pressure control box can be purchased directly from Neuromatic Devices (neuromaticdevices.com).Download and install software from autopatcher.org. Perform initial software setup. Detailed instructions are provided in Supplementary Information Appendix A[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20210519/Supplementary%20Information.docx].Register the manipulator according to the manufacturer and COM port (see Supplementary Information Figures S1-S2[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20210519/Supplementary%20Information.docx]).Register the pressure control box to the specified COM port (see Supplementary Information Figures S1-S2[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20210519/Supplementary%20Information.docx]).Before each experiment Prepare biological samples for patch-clamp recording. Methods are referenced for experimental preparations in which pipette cleaning has been validated by us or in other published reports.For in vitro HEK 293 cells, follow Kolb et al. (2016). Pipette cleaning works well with wild-type cells, stably transfected lines, and transient transfections (Kolb et al., 2016 and 2019)For rodent neuron culture recording, follow Kaech and Banker (2006) and Kolb et al. (2016). Cleaning for this preparation is verified in Kolb et al. (2016 and 2019).For acute brain tissue slices recording, follow Jiang et al. (2015). Cleaning for this preparation is verified in the following reports Kolb et al. (2016 and 2019).For in vivo mouse recording in anesthetized preparations, follow Bagal et al. (2013). Cleaning for this preparation is verified in Kolb et al. (2016 and 2019) and Stoy et al. (2020).For acute human brain tissue slices, follow Ting et al. (2018) and Peng et al. (2019).",
    "Cleaning for this preparation is verified in Peng et al. (2019).For human cerebral organoids, follow Mariani et al. (2015) and Qian et al. (2016). We have verified the cleaning in this preparation in unpublished experiments.Prepare electrophysiology rig for the patch-clamp experiment and prepare pipettes as appropriate for experiment. Detailed guides for patch-clamp rig setup, denoising, and troubleshooting are provided elsewhere (Perin and Markram, 2013; Wang et al., 2015; Kodandaramaiah et al., 2016).Load software for a push-to-clean patch-clamp experiment (Supplementary Information Appendix C[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20210519/Supplementary%20Information.docx]).Make 2% w/v Tergazyme cleaning solution.Prepare 2% w/v Tergazyme solution in room temperature deionized water.Mix solution until all Tergazyme powder is dissolved.Note: Because Tergazyme is an enzymatic detergent, the enzymatic component degrades over time. The manufacturer recommends making fresh solutions and using them within 8 h for maximum efficacy. Fill cleaning and rinsing bath reservoirs with filtered solutionsUsing a syringe with a 0.2 µm filter and 23G needle, fill the appropriate bath reservoir with freshly made 2% w/v Tergazyme (or extracellular solution for rinsing).Be careful not to overfill the cleaning bath reservoir, as this can cause Tergazyme solution to flow into the experimental chamber, potentially damaging the cells.Note: To ensure there is no fluid exchange between the cleaning bath and the experimental bath, insert the tip of the pipette into the cleaning bath and monitor the square wave pulse in the voltage clamp. If there is no electrical contact between the ungrounded cleaning bath and the grounded experimental bath, you will see capacitive transients, similar to when the tip of the pipette is in the air. If there is electrical contact, you will see a square wave pulse, similar to when the tip is submerged in the experimental bath.",
    "To resolve this, use a task wipe to remove a small amount of fluid from the cleaning bath until electrical contact is eliminated. In the software interface, calibrate manipulators in reference to cells and cleaning baths (Figure 6).Select and save “exp bath location” position above target cell.Select and save “location above baths” position directly above the cleaning bath reservoir.Select and save “cleaning bath location” position with tip safely submerged in cleaning solution.Select and save “wash bath” position with tip safely submerged in rinsing solution (i.e., extracellular solution) if desired.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4085/bioprotoc-11-14-4085-g006.jpgFigure 6. Calibration of pipettes for pipette cleaning. Positions used by the push-to-clean software for each cleaning attempt. Images in (A) refer to saved position values in (B). Briefly, (1) refers to position directly above target cells or tissue, (2) refers to a z-location above the clean and rinse baths, (3) refers to the position where the tip is submerged in cleaning solution, and (4) refers to the position where the pipette tip is submerged in the rinsing solution.Patch-clamp experiment Attempt patch-clamp recording on target cellInitiate pipette cleaning using the software interface by clicking the “clean” button. The functions performed by the software are as follows:Pipette retracts from cell to “location above baths” position under light positive pressure (+50 mbar).Pipette moves from “location above baths” position to “cleaning bath location” position until contact is made between the pipette tip and the cleaning solution.Note: Touching the pipette to the surface of the cleaning solution can be detected as a change in the capacitance of a square wave pulse at the pipette tip. This can often be observed prior to the pipette visibly touching the surface. Visible confirmation of pipette-fluid contact is also sufficient to begin cleaning. With pipette tip in cleaning bath, suction is applied (-345 mbar) for 5 s.",
    "Five rounds of alternating pulses of suction (-345 mbar for 1 s) and positive pressure (+700 mbar for 1 s) are applied.Positive pressure is applied (+700 mbar) for 5 s to expel any residual cleaning solution from pipette tip.Pipette is retracted from cleaning bath to “location above baths” position and then to either “exp bath location” position or “wash bath” position (optional).Rinse the pipette (optional)Pipette is moved from “cleaning bath location” position to “location above baths” position under positive pressure (+ 200 mbar).Pipette is moved down from “location above baths” position toward “wash bath” position until contact is made between the pipette tip and the cleaning solution.With pipette tip in rinse bath, apply 3 s of suction (-345 mbar) followed by 10 s of positive pressure (+700 mbar).Retract pipette from “wash bath” position to “location above baths” position under positive pressure (+200 mbar).Attempt patch-clamp recording on next target cellRepeat steps A-D until the end of the experiment or failure of the pipette (e.g., tip breakage, clog, evaporation of cleaning solution, or user error).Note: If the pipette appears to be clogged (i.e., visible internal clog observed in pipette tip or increase in resistance) or broken (i.e., visible broken tip or decrease in resistance), then replace it and repeat calibration."
