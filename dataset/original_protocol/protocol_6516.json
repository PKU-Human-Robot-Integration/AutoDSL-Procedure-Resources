    "Extraction of L-[3H(G)]-serineHandle and store L-[3H(G)]-Serine only in designated and authorized locations with proper precautions.Dispose radioactive waste in specially designated waste containers.Take 2 µl of serine before and after extraction and measure radioactivity to calculate the recovery of L-[3H(G)]-Serine.Dispense 0.2 ml of the [3H]-serine into a 2 ml screw cap tube, then add 0.5 ml of chloroform:methanol (2:1 ratio) to the tube.Vortex the tube for 1 min.Centrifuge the tube at 16,200 x g for 2 min at room temperature in a high speed centrifuge.Transfer the upper aqueous phase into fresh 2 ml screw cap tubes.Place the tubes into the house vacuum flask for 30 min to remove the traces of organic solvents.Measure the radioactivity after extraction to calculate specific activity of L-[3H(G)]-serine.Use this extracted [3H]-serine to measure SPT activity in cells and membranes.Extracted [3H]-serine will give less background, i.e., low counts with myriocin treatment in SPT assay.Assay of lipid inhibition of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) activity in intact HeLa cellsGrow HeLa cells in DMEM complete medium and maintain cells in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.On day-1, plate HeLa cells (7 x 104 cells/well) in a collagen coated 24-well plate with 1 ml of DMEM complete medium.See Recipes for the procedure of collagen coating in 24-well plates.Divide cells into 4 groups for control, C8-ceramide, myriocin treatment and protein analysis.Prepare 4 wells for each group and use average value for calculations.Myriocin is a specific inhibitor for SPT and is a negative control for this assay.On day-2, add 10 µM C8-ceramide or 1 µM myriocin to the cells and incubate for 1 h in a CO2 incubator, see recipe for C8-ceramide and myriocin preparation.Incubate control cells with methanol-BSA complex.After 1 h remove C8-ceramide or myriocin and gently wash cells with 0.25 ml of PBS at room temperature.",
    "Measure SPT activity by adding 0.25 ml of extracted 3H-serine to the cells in serine free MEM media (5 µCi/ml of serine free media) and incubate cells in a CO2 incubator for 1 h at 37 °C.After 1 h, remove radioactive serine and gently wash cells with 0.25 ml of PBS at room temperature.Stop the reaction by adding 400 µl of alkaline methanol and scrape the cells using plastic cell lifters.Transfer cells into 2 ml screw cap tubes.Extract total sphingolipids under alkaline conditions as described below in Section H.Refer to Figure 1A in Davis et al.

    "Stop the reaction by adding 400 µl of alkaline methanol and scrape the cells using plastic cell lifters.Transfer cells into 2 ml screw cap tubes for lipid extraction.Extract total sphingolipids under alkaline condition as described below in Section H.Refer to Figure 1A in Davis et al. (2019) and Figure 2A-B in Siow and Wattenberg (2012) for results.Preparation of HeLa cell lysateSeed 3 x 106 HeLa cells into one T-150 flask with DMEM complete medium.Grow HeLa cells for 48 h in a CO2 incubator to achieve 90-95% confluency.Remove the DMEM complete media and wash cells with 4 ml of PBS at room temperature.Add 4 ml of 0.05% trypsin to cells and incubate for 2 min at room temperature.After 2 min, remove trypsin and incubate cells at 37 °C for 5 min.Harvest cells with 10 ml of ice cold DMEM complete media.Collect cells by centrifugation for 10 min at 72 x g.Wash cells with 10 ml of ice cold PBS.Resuspend cells in 1.6 ml of swelling buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 15 mM KCl and 1 mM MgCl2) and incubate on ice for 15 min.To this, add 534 µl of 1 M sucrose, 7 µl of 200 mM EDTA and 80 µl of protease inhibitors cocktail from 25x stock.Note: 25x stock made by dissolving 1 protease inhibitor tablet in 2 ml of water.
