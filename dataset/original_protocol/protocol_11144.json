    "The following procedure was conducted according to the recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki and Tokyo and the Guidelines for the Use of Experimental Animals of the European Community. The experiments were also approved by the Animal Care Committee at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.\n1. Preparing Rats for the Experimental Procedure\nNote: For the experimental procedure, select male Sprague-Dawley rats with no overt pathology, each weighing between 300 and 350 g.\nHouse three rats per cage, with chow and water available ad libitum, and allow for at least two weeks of adaptation, alternating between 12 h of daylight and 12 h of darkness.\nBefore initiation of the experiment, test all rats for the presence of depressive-like behaviors using a 3-day sucrose preference test (refer to step 4).\nExclude rats that are perceived to display depressive-like behaviors and those that are housed in the same cages as such rats, so as to avoid possible spread of depression to unaffected rats before the experiment has begun first, eliminate rats that test positive for depression; then, eliminate rats that are housed in the same cages as the depressed rats.\nIf necessary, exclude additional rats at random to create final groups of 60 rats for the depression experiment, 30 rats for the contagion group, and 30 ratsforthe control group.\nTag rats (using numbered stickers), throughout the experimental procedures. Temporarily transfer rats to single cages during the experiments (in the same room and dark cycle for the CUS, Sucrose and open field tests, and in a different room and dark cycle for the forced-swim test and for one of the stressors (refer to 2.1.7)) and return them to their original social groups at the end.\n2. The Procedure for the Induction of Depression in Rats",
    "Note: In order to induce depression, subject the 60 rats in the CUS-exposed group to several manipulations of CUS for five weeks20.\nExpose rats daily to any 2 of the following 7 stressors, in a random order; to one stressor during the day and to the other at night, for 5 consecutive weeks.\n\t\nHouse the rats in groups (six rats, instead of the usual three, per cage for 18 h);\nPlace the rats in a tilted cage (45° along the vertical axis for 3 h);\nDeprive the rats of food (18 h);\nDeprive the rats of water (18 h) and expose them to empty water bottles immediately following a period of acute water deprivation (1 h);\nPlace the rats in a wet bedding cage (with 300 mL of water spilled in the bedding) for 8 h (night cycle);\nExpose the rats to continuous lighting (24 h) and reversed light/dark cycle (12 h) twice per week;\nPlace the rats in a hot environment (40°C, 5 min - night cycle), with another apparatus used to increase the heat.\nConfirm the development of depression by performing a sucrose preference test (refer to step 4).\n\tNote: The protocol can be paused after each of the above steps. Additionally, if any aberrant behavior is displayed by any rat, then, eliminate the rat and any other rat that might have been affected by the erratic rat.\n3. The Procedure for Establishing Depression-Contagion in Naïve Rats\nEstablish 30 social groups with rats from the CUS-exposed (60) and depression-contagion (30) groups:\n\t\nHouse two CUS-exposed rats per cage in 30 different cages.\nAdd one rat from the depression-contagion group to each cage containing two CUS- exposed rats.\nAllow cohabitation for 5 weeks , under standard conditions,with chow and water available ad libitum.",
    "After 5 weeks of cohabitation, subject all groups to the sucrose preference, open field, and forced-swim tests in the order shown in Figure 1.\n4. The Sucrose preference test21\nDuring the dark cycle, place the rats in individual cages in the same room as the housing.\nPlace a bottle of 100 mL 1% (w/v) sucrose solution in each cage for 24 h, and allow for adaptation.\nRemove the bottles and deprive the rats of food and water for 12 h.\nPlace two bottles, one containing 100 mL of sucrose solution (1 %, w/v) and the other, 100 mL of tap water, in each cage for 4 h.\nRecord the volume (in mL) of both the consumed sucrose solution and water, and calculate the affinity to sucrose preference as follows:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57137/57137eq1.jpg\n5. The Open Field Test\nNote: The standard open field test is commonly used to assess locomotor, exploratory, and anxiety-like behaviors, and behavioral responses to novelty in laboratory animals22, 23. This test has also been shown to analyze depressive behaviors24. The open field test examines two opposing parameters; the rodents' fear for the bright light shining at the center of the field against their expressive desire towards novelty. When anxious, rodents tend to avoid discovery and stay put by the walls (thigmotaxis). This anxiety is determined by the degree of averting the brightly lit central field. The open field, consisting of a black lusterless acrylic box (120 cm × 60 cm × 60 cm), is divided into the central part (25%) and the rest of the box (75%). This test takes place in the same room as the housing during the dark cycle. A video camera, suspended about 200 cm above the field, is used for recording the open field test22, 23.",
    "Clean the apparatus with 5% alcohol prior to the introduction of each animal. Place the rat at the corner of the open field facing the wall.\nRecord the rat's behavior with a video camera for 5 min.\nAnalyze post-recordings of the following parameters: total travel distance, velocity in the central part of the field, and time spent in the central part of the field.\n6. The Forced-Swim Test\nNote: The principle of the forced swim test is based on the fact that when rats are forced to swim in a confined space, they eventually give up and remain immobile, occasionally moving their bodies in order to avoid drowning21, 23. Due to the enormity of the already assembled apparatus, this test was carried out in the different room during the dark cycle.\nFor habituation, place the rat in a glass cylinder (100 cm tall, 40 cm in diameter, and 40 cm deep) containing water at room temperature, for a 15 min swimming session.\nRemove the rat from the cylinder, dry with paper towels, and place in a warm cage for 15 min.\nReturn the rat to its home (original) cage;\n\tNote: The protocol can be paused here. Also, if any rat in the course of this test is drowning, pull it out immediately.\nOn the following day, videotape a 5-min swim session and analyze post-recordings of the following parameters: Immobility, Climbing, and Defecation.\nSubscription Required.
