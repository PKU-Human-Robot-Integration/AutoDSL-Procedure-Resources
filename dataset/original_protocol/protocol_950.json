    "**Imaging and exporting z-stack image from ZEN \\(blue edition)**\n1. Set up the channels in ZEN with the wavelength values of the fluorescence dye \\(the information is available in the manual of the kit). There will be only two channels, since the kit contains two staining probes.\n  2. Activate the ‘Z-stack’ checkbox in the Acquisition dimensions.\n  3. Select ‘Z-stack tool’ in the Multidimensional Acquisition tool group. Open the tool.\n  4. Set all values in the tool. Then click Start Auto Configuration. \\(You can also do this step manually)\n  5. Click on the Start Experiment button to start the experiment. The z-stack image will be provided with merged version, if not, merge the images from individual channels manually. \n  6. Set live-channel with green color and dead-channel with red color.\n  7. Move to Processing tab on the category. Find Orthogonal Projection and click on it.\n  8. Change Method Parameters tab to Average for general projection view. The consideration depends on the cell environment or gain factor that is used during the exposure, hence try both options and select better one. \n  _CAUTION\\!_ Make sure that the Thickness tab should include all of planar images.\n9. Click Max/Min button in Display window under the image overview. This process will revise red and green color intensity.\n  10. After the conversion, find Image Export in Method category. Export the image in proper format. The formats jpeg, jpg and JPEG XR are not recommended.\n  \n**How to run NIVA.exe with the image**\n11. Run NIVA.exe in your computer.\n  12. Load your image in the program. Supporting image formats are jpg, jpeg, bmp, png, tif and tiff. \n  _CAUTION\\!_ Although .jpg and .jpeg image file formats are available in this program, for the accurate image process, they are not recommended to use.\n**Image processing in NIVA.exe**",
    "13. Increase LowL value in the trackbar included in Values groupbox. The program will automatically blur and threshold the image. The LowL value stands for lower boundary intensity value in thresholding process \\(Figure 2).\n  <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/6677/original/figure2.bmp?1526196853\" > <img src=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/6677/thumbnail/figure2.png?1526196853\" > </a>\n14. Once the LowL value is manipulated in step 13, the image that is loaded at the beginning will be changed in real-time. Observe the changed image in the program and find the appropriate values.\n  15. In step 14, gray colored contours will be shown in the image. Try to figure out the desired region of interest \\(ROI) with the contours.\n  16. Increase the Morph value in order to erase small objects that is to be disregarded. This will execute morphological process with n by n matrix, with a size of the value and the ellipse-like shapes \\(Figure 3).\n  <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/6679/original/figure3.bmp?1526196962\" > <img src=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/6679/thumbnail/figure3.png?1526196962\" > </a>\n17. Click Calculate button in the groupbox. Then the respective percentage of red and green pixels will appear, as well as the normalized histogram \\(Figure 4).\n  <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/6681/original/figure4.bmp?1526197070\" > <img src=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/6681/thumbnail/figure4.png?1526197070\" > </a>\n_CAUTION\\!_ Since both vertical and horizontal axis was normalized, the scale of red and green line is different.\n18. To obtain the accurate and reliable results, repeat the steps at least 5 times per each islet samples and use the average value to assess islet viability."
