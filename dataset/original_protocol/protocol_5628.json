  "procedures": [
    "Germinate the seeds of Nigella damascena L. in 90 mm Petri dishes covered with damp filter paper at 25 °С in the dark. It takes about a week for roots to grow into 10 mm.For chromatin labeling, use 10 mm long roots. Incubate the germinated seeds in distilled water with 50 μM EdU (EdU is a part of Click-iT EdU Alexa 555 Imaging Kit, prepare the stock solution according to manufacturer’s recommendations) for 30 min. Incubate in 90 mm Petri with 10 ml of EdU solution on an orbital shaker (50 rpm) mounted inside an incubator at 25 °С.Incubate seeds in 200 µM thymidine for 30 min, and then grow in distilled water during different time period that allowed to label different chromosome regions. In case of Nigella damascena L., 3.5 h incubation is sufficient to find the first labeled mitosis (Kuznetsova et al., 2017). Incubate in 90 mm Petri with 10 ml of thymidine solution or distilled water on an orbital shaker (50 rpm) mounted inside an incubator at 25 °С.Excise root tips that are 1.0 mm long from 10 mm long roots using a single edge blade, transfer to 1.5 ml microtubes and fix in 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.5x PBS for 1.5 h at room temperature (for additional fixation protocol see Note 1). Note: Use a chemical fume hood while handing formaldehyde-containing chemicals.After fixation, wash the root tips in 0.5x PBS, dehydrate and infiltrate in LR White acrylic resin using the following steps:Wash roots with 0.5x PBS 3 times for 5 min each.Wash roots with 50% ethanol for 30 min.Dehydrate specimens in 70% ethanol 2 times for 30 min each (it is possible to store specimens in 70% ethanol at 4 °С).Infiltrate with LR White and 70% ethanol (2:1) mixture (1 ml) for 1 h.",
    "For LR white/ethanol mixture preparation, slowly add one part of 70% ethanol (drop by drop) to two parts of LR White, and rotate the tube gently (otherwise the mixture will become milky).Incubate in LR White (1 ml) for 1 h.Incubate in LR White (1 ml) overnight at 4 °С.Incubate in LR White (1 ml) for 1 h.Note: Incubate without rocking and at room temperature, unless otherwise specified.It is important to limit the contact of oxygen with the resin while polymerization occurs. The most convenient way of achieving this is to use gelatin capsules. Place several (3-4) roots in the bottom of the capsule and fill up with LR White to the brim and slide the other half of the capsule on (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180201/20180201195223_4751.jpgFigure 1. The transfer of roots from microtubes to gelatin capsules for polymerization. For removal of roots from microtubes and transfer to capsules, it is convenient to use straight tip tweezers and do not discard LR White form the microtubes. Fill up the gelatin capsules with LR White to the brim.Polymerize at 55 °С for 24 h.Prepare semi-thin sections (100-250 nm) using an Ultratome using either glass knife or diamond knife for sectioning of histology specimens.Mount semi-thin sections on Formvar-coated cover slips (see Recipes) using a Perfect Loop.Dry cover slips with semi-thin sections at 37 °С for 2-3 h for better attachment of section.Detect EdU using a Click-iT EdU Alexa 555 Imaging Kit according to manufacturer’s protocol (see Note 2). The staining is carried out in the humid chamber in the dark. The humid chamber is a 90 mm non-vented Petri dish, whose bottom is covered with Parafilm. A piece of moist cotton wool is placed near the dish wall.",
    "Drops of a dye solution are placed on the Parafilm, cover slips are placed on these drops (sections downwards) (Figure 2). The dishes are sealed with the Parafilm.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180201/20180201195257_1883.jpgFigure 2. Humid chamberStain DNA with 1 μg/ml DAPI solution in 30 mm Petri dishes for 10 min, and after washing in PBS for 5 min, mount sections in Mowiol with the anti-bleaching agent, 1,4-diazabicyclo-[2.2.2]-octane (DABCO).Image stacks may be acquired using either wild-field fluorescent microscopy with 3D-deconvolution (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180201/20180201195324_7886.jpgFigure 3.
