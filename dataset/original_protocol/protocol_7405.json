    "Poly-L-lysine is an effective agent that promotes adherence of cells and ECM to coated solid surfaces.Polycationic poly-L-lysine molecules are strongly adsorbed onto the solid surfaces. The anionic sites on the cells recognize the exposed polycationic sites on these molecules, therefore enhancing the attachment of the cells to the surface of the coated tissue culture plates, forming a monolayer of cells (Mazia et al., 1975; Macieira-Coelho and Avrameas, 1972). For the seeding of fibroblasts, coating of tissue culture ware is done by covering the surface briefly with a 0.01% working solution of poly-L-lysine.Tissue culture plates coating Prepare sterile 0.01% working solution (in deionized water) from commercially available 0.1% stock solution of poly-L-lysine.Coat 10 cm tissue culture dishes by covering the entire surface with 0.01% poly-L-lysine.Note: 5 mL of working poly-L-lysine solution is sufficient for covering the surface of a 10 cm culture plate. Incubate the plates for half an hour in a CO2 incubator maintained at 37 °C and a 5% CO2 saturation level.Notes:  Take the plates from the incubator and remove the excess poly-L-lysine solution. Collect any excess solution from the plates. Avoid putting any scratch on the coated surface with the pipette tips. Keep the plates open under UV for 30 min at room temperature inside a sterile tissue culture hood.Note: Avoid over-drying the coated plates, as it might compromise the attachment of cardiac fibroblasts because of coating disruption. These plates are now ready for seeding the cardiac fibroblasts after completing the digestion steps.Methodology Immunofluorescence protocol:  Immunofluorescence experiments were performed with primary neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts as described previously (Maity et al., 2020). 3.7% formaldehyde was used for the fixation of the cells for 10 min at room temperature, and permeabilization was done using 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature.",
    "Three washes with 1× PBS for 3 min each were given to the cells before each step. Blocking the cells was done using 5% BSA in PBST buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were prepared in 1% BSA in PBST and incubated with the cells overnight at 4 °C. After washing the cells thrice with 1× PBS for 3 min each, they were incubated with the secondary antibody prepared in 1% BSA in PBST for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained using Hoechst 33258 (1:2,000) for 10 min. Fluoromount aqueous mounting medium was used to mount the coverslips on clean glass slides, and imaging was done with a confocal microscope. The antibodies used have been listed in Table 1.Western Blotting:  Western blotting was performed for primary neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts as previously described (Maity et al., 2020). In short, total protein lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors and protease inhibitors. Samples were prepared by mixing the lysates with 2× Laemmli sample buffer with 5% β-mercaptoethanol. The prepared samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel at 80 V. PVDF membrane (0.45 µm) was utilized for transferring the proteins through overnight wet transfer at 20 V, using transfer buffer. Blocking of the membrane after the transfer was done using 5% skimmed milk in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. Upon washing the blocked membrane with TBST, it was incubated with primary antibody (prepared in 5% BSA in TBST) overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with secondary antibody (prepared in 1% skimmed milk in TBST) for 1 h at room temperature. Antibodies bound to the PVDF membrane were visualized using a western ECL reagent in a chemiluminescence imager.",
    "The antibodies used have been listed in Table 1.Real-time PCR:  qRT-PCR analysis was performed as described previously (Maity et al., 2020). RNAiso Plus reagent was used for the isolation of total RNA from the cells following the manufacturer’s protocol. Purity and integrity of the isolated RNA were confirmed, and cDNA synthesis was done using 1 μg of the RNA with the PrimeScript 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis kit. RT-PCR was performed with the SYBR-Green PCR master mix in a real-time PCR machine. The primers used in the study are listed in Table 2.Table 2. List of primers used in the study table:",

    "TGF-β1 treatment:  Used media was removed from the cells and they were washed with PBS; 10 ng/mL TGF-β1 in serum-free DMEM was added to the cells, followed by incubation for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 saturation. Upon completion of the treatment, cells were either harvested for lysate preparation (western blot analysis) or RNA isolation (qRT-PCR analysis) according to the planned experiments. The treated cells could also be fixed using 4% formaldehyde for immunofluorescence experiments.Commentary:  All major organs have resident fibroblasts, the most widely present active cells of the connective tissue (Kendall and Feghali-Bostwick, 2014). They play a crucial role in the proper functioning of the organs. Fibroblasts are essential for regulating gene expression affecting the site-specific differentiation of cells in different organs (Rinn et al., 2006). Interactions of fibroblasts with different cell types have been proven to play a significant role in the patterning of various organs, including the lung, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. Fibroblasts express specific genes, which help provide identity to cells in different organs, and, therefore, can be used to study organ-specific functions and the process of organogenesis (Rinn et al., 2006). Fibrosis, the excess production of ECM proteins, including collagen, to form scar tissue, is the underlying process for all fibrotic-related diseases. The production of scar tissue is important for sealing open wounds. However, if unregulated, it may act as the basis of numerous diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, systemic sclerosis, kidney fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, and cardiac fibrosis (Zhang and Zhang, 2020). Other than fibrosis, fibroblasts have also been shown to play a role in inflammation and cancer progression. In a published study, fibroblasts have been found to maintain inflammation, eventually leading to rheumatoid arthritis and supporting the growth of tumor mass (Mizoguchi et al., 2018; Winkler et al., 2020).",
    "In a healthy heart, fibroblasts can regenerate functional tissue. They are known to be involved in wound healing, inflammation, the proliferation of cells, deposition of ECM, and eventually remodeling (desJardins-Park et al., 2018). Cardiac fibroblasts play an important role in maintaining homeostasis and normal heart function, as well as in pathological conditions involving cardiac remodeling, such as hypertension and myocardial infarction. The functions that fibroblasts are involved in include the production and deposition of ECM proteins, the interaction and communication with other cell types including myocytes, and the intercellular signaling with endothelial cells and other fibroblasts. These interactions have been shown to regulate the electrophysiological properties of the cells, secretion of cytokines and growth factors, and angiogenesis. Several studies have been conducted to elucidate the role of fibroblasts in all these processes, except angiogenesis (Souders et al., 2009). Cardiac fibroblasts form a scaffold by secreting ECM, in which the cardiomyocytes are embedded to create the 3D structure of a healthy heart. This leads to dense packaging of cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts with each other, making it difficult to study each cell type separately. Hence, gaining information about these cells becomes difficult while they are in a three-dimensional arrangement in vitro.Cell culture in two-dimension has proven to be a very proficient approach for studying conceptual molecular biology. Though the cultured immortalized cell lines can be maintained for many passages, they do not accurately represent the in vitro conditions. Therefore, they are not the best model to study the physiological and pathophysiological aspects of the cell. Consequently, it is of utmost importance to be able to culture cardiac fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes separately in two-dimensional culture in vitro to study their functions individually.",
    "Most of what is already known about these cells, including their function and morphology in the heart and their behavior upon stimulation, has been possible by conducting experiments in two-dimensional primary tissue culture. In the present study, cultured primary cardiac fibroblasts proved to be of better biological relevance than immortalized cell lines. Upon stimulation, these cells in culture reflect various molecular changes in vitro (Landry et al., 2021). Therefore, these cells can be used to investigate multiple cellular responses under different conditions as these are the closest mimic of the processes that occur in vitro (Eghbali, 1992). However, upon passaging the cells 2–3 times, the cardiac fibroblasts tend to transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts, which are characterized by an increased α-SMA secretion (Rohr, 2011).Since fibroblasts are involved in the pathogenesis of various diseases, cultured fibroblasts can act as a suitable model for studying several diseases and pathological conditions. Moreover, cultured fibroblasts can be used to study drug toxicology and even drug screening. Fibroblasts cultured from human skin have been used in a published study to elucidate the cytotoxic effects and skin irritation of surfactants (Lee et al., 2000). In another study, fibroblasts isolated from lungs have been utilized to study the toxicity of antimicrobial drugs (Krempaska et al., 2020).Although cultured cardiac fibroblasts cannot completely mimic the in vitro phenotype, they prove to be an advantageous model in several aspects for both physiological and pathophysiological studies. For example, they can be selectively manipulated with numerous treatments without interference from cardiomyocytes as they are cultured as a distinct homogenous population (Ravi et al., 2021). These cells can be used for various genetic and/or drug screening purposes, which may be completed in comparatively less time than in vitro studies.",
    "Cultured cardiac fibroblasts are also a beneficial tool for studying the factors responsible for their transformation and regulating the production and degradation of the ECM. Moreover, they can be used to elucidate cardiac fibroblasts’ role in the endocrine activity (Grupp and Müller, 1999).Mouse and rats are used for culturing the primary cardiac fibroblasts due to several reasons. Rat and mice models are easily available without the requirement of high cost and skills. Additionally, these murine models are very well studied, and most of the studies on signaling pathways and metabolics that have been published have been carried out in these models (Zaragoza et al., 2011).Cultured primary fibroblasts act as a better model system in biological research when compared to immortal cancer cell lines. These cells lack mutations in the tumor repressor genes and the oncogenes. Therefore, they make for a preferred model system for studies on DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis (Alikhani et al., 2005; Schauble et al., 2012; Marthandan et al., 2016). Moreover, most existing protocols use sophisticated and specialized techniques like density gradient centrifugation. Our protocol, however, is a set of simple steps involving commonly available machines and chemicals that can be easily found in all laboratories.Although cultured primary fibroblasts are an excellent model for studying fibrosis, they have their limitations. The primary fibroblasts in culture may spontaneously transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts due to the contact with solid surfaces of the culture dishes. Additionally, since these cells are grown in isolation from other cell types present around them in a living organism, it is impossible to fully comprehend the interactions and signaling pathways regulated by those interactions between fibroblasts and the various other cell types in different organs.Results Using the described protocol, we successfully cultured primary cardiac fibroblasts from neonatal murine pups (P0-P2).",
    "Further, the cultured cells were treated with TGF-β1, a major regulator of fibrosis. Overall, our results demonstrate the expected outcome of the protocol as described. Moreover, we show that these cells can be transdifferentiated into activated myofibroblasts upon TGF-β1 treatment.Visualization and characterization of cultured cardiac fibroblasts Fibroblasts appear round during the initial stages of pre-plating and the beginning of attachment to the coated surface of the cell culture dishes. With time, the fibroblasts spread and attach firmly to the coated culture dishes. Eventually, they form a monolayer of plump, spindle-shaped cells (Figure 2A). Some cells remain rounded and do not attach even after a day; these cells can be washed off using PBS while passaging the cells or changing the medium. On keeping the fibroblasts in a confluent state, starving the cells of serum, or treating the cells with TGF-β1, the spindle-shaped fibroblasts transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts, which have a characteristic large surface area with various protrusions of the plasma membrane (Figure 2B).Treatment of cardiac fibroblasts with TGF-β1 TGF-β1 is one of the major regulators of fibrosis. TGF-β1 treatment is a well-established model for studying the induction of fibrosis in mice and cultured cells. Upon TGF-β1 treatment, the fibroblasts get activated and transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts. This can be characterized by enhanced production of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), a myofibroblast-specific marker. α-SMA is a cytoskeletal protein responsible for activated myofibroblasts' mobility. Additionally, since TGF-β1 treatment results in the induction of fibrosis, it is accompanied by an increase in the production and deposition of the ECM proteins, including fibronectin 1 (FN1), collagen 1a (Col1a), and collagen 3a (Col3a). These act as fibrotic markers, and their levels can indicate whether fibrosis has set in upon the treatment.",
    "To show that the isolated cells are indeed cardiac fibroblasts and can be differentiated into myofibroblasts, we treated the cells with TGF-β1 (10 ng/mL) for 24 h to induce fibrosis. The cells with and without TGF-β1 treatment were stained with myofibroblast specific markers (α-SMA) and fibrotic markers (FN1, Col1a, and Col3a). We observed an increase in the protein levels of α-SMA and a difference in its arrangement, confirming the transdifferentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts upon TGF-β1 treatment (Figure 2C). Moreover, we could note an increase in the protein levels of FN1, Col1a, and Col3a, all of which are fibrotic markers (Figure 2C). This implies that fibrosis is enhanced in the cells treated with TGF-β1 compared to the controls.To further solidify our claims, we performed a western blot analysis to check the protein levels of α-SMA, FN1, Col1a, and Col3a. The cells were treated with TGF-β1 (10 ng/mL) for 24 h in serum-free media, and the lysates were prepared and run in an SDS-PAGE gel. We found an increase in the levels of α-SMA, FN1, Col1a, and Col3a, thus confirming that there was an increased population of myofibroblasts than fibroblasts in the TGF-β1-treated samples as compared to control samples (Figure 3A). Further, we performed qRT-PCR analysis to check if there was any change in the mRNA levels of α-SMA, FN1, Col1a, and Col3a. Upon analysis of the qRT-PCR results, we found that the mRNA levels of Col1a were elevated in TGF-β1-treated samples compared to controls (Figure 3B). However, we could not see a significant difference in the mRNA levels of other genes.Our results prove that the cells isolated using the protocol are indeed cardiac fibroblasts and can be differentiated into myofibroblasts using TGF-β1 treatment.",
    "The cultured cardiac fibroblasts can be used for similar studies to evaluate the toxicity of various drugs and phenotypic and subcellular changes resulting from such treatments.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4616/bioprotoc-13-04-4616-g002.jpgFigure 2.
