    "All procedures in (A) sample pooling, (B) preparation of positive sample-pool, (C) ribonucleic acid (RNA) extraction, and (D) quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) were carried out separately inside different biosafety cabinets. All clinical waste and consumables were autoclaved prior to being sent for incineration.Sample pooling (see Figure 1)We chose 10 sample-pools since the positive detection rate in our laboratory is less than 2%. You may optimize the sample-pool size according to the positive detection rate in your laboratory (Abdalhamid et al., 2020).Pipette 60 µl each of the 10 clinical NP/OP swabs into a single 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. The total volume is 600 µl. The original volume of the specimens ranged from 1 ml to 3 ml.Aliquot 300 µl pooled swabs to each of two clean 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes and label with the same sample ID.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210426/20210426195020_8179.jpgFigure 1. Pooling of 10 individual samples Preparation of positive sample-poolIdentify a positive NP/OP swab that has a CT value ≥15.00 but ≤36.00 (refer to Table S2 in Lim et al., 2020).Aliquot the identified positive NP/OP swab and store at -20°C.Prepare the positive sample-pool according to Steps A2-A3 by mixing 1 positive with 9 unknown samples.RNA extractionChoose either of the kits below for RNA extractionGeneaid Viral Nucleic Acid Extraction KitAdd 400 µl VB Lysis Buffer to each of the 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. Shake the tube virgorously for 10 s.Incubate at room temperature for 10 min.Add 450 µl AD Buffer (make sure that the ethanol has been added) to each of the 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. Shake the tube vigorously to mix.Transfer 700 µl lysate mixture to the VB column in a 2-ml collection tube. Centrifuge at 14,000 × g for 30 s. Discard the flowthrough and place the VB Column back into the 2-ml collection tube. Repeat Step (iv) until all the mixture (two 1.",
    "5-ml microcentrifuge tubes prepared in Step A3) has completely flowed through the VB column.Add 400 µl W1 Buffer to the VB column and centrifuge at 14,000 × g for 30 s. Discard the flowthrough and place the VB column back into the 2-ml collection tube.Add 600 µl Wash Buffer (make sure that the ethanol has been added) to the VB column. Centrifuge at 14,000 × g for 30 s. Discard the flowthrough and place the VB column back into the 2-ml collection tube.Centrifuge at 14,000 × g for 3 min to dry the column matrix.Place the dried VB column in a clean 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Add 35 µl DNAse RNase-free water to the center of the VB column matrix and incubate for 3 min at room temperature (15-25°C).Centrifuge at ≥6,000 × g for 1 min to elute the purified nucleic acid.Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue KitPipette 20 µl Proteinase K into each 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube.Add 200 µl Buffer AL and mix thoroughly by shaking vigorously.Incubate at 56°C for 10 min.Add 200 µl ethanol (96-100%) and mix thoroughly by shaking vigorously.Pipette 700 µl mixture into a DNeasy Mini spin column placed in a 2-ml collection tube. Centrifuge at ≥6,000 × g for 1 min. Repeat Step (v) until all the mixture (two 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes prepared in Step A3) has completely flowed through the spin column. Discard the flowthrough and collection tube.Place the spin column into a clean 2-ml collection tube.Add 500 µl Buffer AW1 and centrifuge for 1 min at ≥6,000 × g.Discard the flowthrough and collection tube.Place the spin column in a clean 2-ml collection tube, add 500 µl Buffer AW2, and centrifuge for 3 min at 14,000 × g.Discard the flowthrough and collection tube.Transfer the spin column into a clean 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube.",
    "Elute the RNA by adding 35 µl DNAse- and RNAse-free water to the center of the spin column membrane. Incubate for 3 min at room temperature (15-25°C).Centrifuge for 1 min at ≥6,000 × g to elute the purified nucleic acid.RT-qPCRPrepare the RdRP-Primer/Probe mixture (10 µM) (see Recipe).Prepare 3 tests: (1) positive sample-pool; (2) non-template control (NTC); and (3) unknown sample-pool.Prepare the RT-qPCR mixture using the SuperScriptTM III One-Step RT-PCR System with PlatinumTM Taq DNA Polymerase as described in Table 2.        Table 2.
