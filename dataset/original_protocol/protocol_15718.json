    "All the animal procedures have been approved by the Institute of Animal Care Committee of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China.\n1. Materials\nPrepare the following solutions before beginning the protocol.\n\t\nPrepare the loading buffer by adding fetal bovine serum (FBS, 2%) to phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\nAdd neutral red (NR) dye (final 1%) to PBS.\nPrepare the following solutions using the commercially available Adult Brain Dissociation Kit (see the Table of Materials).\n\t\nTo prepare enzyme mix 1, pipette 1.9 mL of Buffer Z and 50 µL of Enzyme P into a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nTo prepare enzyme mix 2, pipette 20 µL of Buffer Y and 10 µL of Enzyme A into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nPrepare the debris removal solution.\n2. Mice perfusion and dissection\nIntraperitoneally (i.p.) inject the mouse with 500 µL of 1% NR dye in PBS 2-3 h before anesthesia.\n\tNOTE: Intraperitoneal injection of NR in demyelinating mouse models helps discern the lesions (Figure 1).\nAnesthetize the mouse with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i.p.), and ensure that the mouse is successfully anesthetized by examining the pain responses.\nOpen the thoracic cavity of the mouse and expose the heart.\nCut off a small corner of the right atrium carefully and intracardially perfuse the mouse with 20-30 mL of cold PBS from the left ventricle.\nDecapitate the mouse under anesthesia.\nOpen the skull of the mouse and carefully free the brain from the skull.\nTransfer the brain to the mouse brain slice mold and cut the brain into 0.1 cm slices.\nRemove the brain slices and place them in cold PBS in a Petri dish (60/15 mm). Microdissect the lesions labeled by NR dye around the corpus callosum under a stereomicroscope using microsurgical forceps.",
    "NOTE: Ensure that the dissected tissue is as complete as possible to facilitate the subsequent transfer; the total dissection progress should be completed in 2 h.\nTransfer the dissected tissue to 15 mL centrifuge tubes containing the appropriate amount of cold loading buffer.\n\t​NOTE: Pool the corpus callosum tissue from 2-3 mice together in one tube as one sample.\n3. Tissue dissociation\nCentrifuge the dissected tissue at 300 ×g for 30 s (after reaching this speed) to collect the sample at the bottom of the tube.\nPreheat enzyme mix 1 and enzyme mix 2 to 37 °C in an incubator.\nAdd 1,950 µL of preheated enzyme mix 1 to one sample and digest in an incubator at 37 °C for 5 min.\nAdd 30 µL of preheated enzyme mix 2 and mix gently.\nDigest in an incubator at 37 °C for 15 min and mix gently every 5 min.\nAdd 4 mL of cold PBS to the tube after digestion and shake gently.\nPlace 70 µm filters on 50 mL centrifuge tubes and prewet the filters with 500 µL of cold PBS. Filter the dissociated tissue by passing the digested tissue samples through the filters, and transfer the filtered suspension in the 50 mL centrifuge tube to a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\n\tNOTE: Skip this step if the amount of tissue is too small.\nCentrifuge the filtered tissue samples at 300 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C and aspirate the supernatant slowly and completely.\n\tNOTE: All the steps should be performed on ice except for the enzymatic digestion.\n4. Debris removal\nResuspend the cell pellet gently with 1,550 µL of cold PBS.\nAdd 450 µL of cold solution for debris removal and mix well.",
    "Overlay the above mixture very slowly and gently with 2 x 1 mL of cold PBS using a 1,000 µL pipette.\n\tNOTE: Tilt the centrifuge tube by 45 ° and slowly add PBS along the tube wall with the pipette.\nTransfer the tube slowly and gently to a centrifuge and spin at 4 °C and 3,000 × g for 10 min.\nLook for three layers after centrifugation. Aspirate the two top layers completely by using a 1,000 µL pipette (Figure 2).\nFill the tube up to 5 mL with cold loading buffer and gently invert the tube three times.\nCentrifuge at 4 °C and 1,000 × g for 10 min. Aspirate the supernatant completely and avoid disrupting the cell pellet.\n5. Magnetic separation of microglial cells\nResuspend the cell pellet with 90 µL of loading buffer and add 10 µL of CD11b (Microglia) beads.\nMix well and incubate for 15 min at 4 °C.\nAdd 1 mL of loading buffer and pipette the liquid gently up and down with a 1,000 µL pipette to wash the cells after the incubation. Centrifuge the cells at 4 °C and 300 × g for 10 min and aspirate the supernatant completely to remove the unbound beads.\nResuspend the cells in 500 µL of loading buffer.\nPlace the MS column with its separator for positive selection in the magnetic field.\nRinse the column with 500 µL of loading buffer to protect the cells and ensure the efficiency of magnetic sorting based on the protocol of the manufacturer.\nApply the cell suspension onto the MS column and discard the flowthrough containing unlabeled cells.\nAdd 500 µL of loading buffer to the column three times to wash away cells that adhere to the column wall and discard the flowthrough.",
    "NOTE: Only add new loading buffer for washing when the column reservoir is completely empty.\nRemove the column from the separator after washing the column and place it on a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nAdd 1 mL of loading buffer into the column and push the plunger to the bottom of the column to flush out the magnetically labeled cells. Repeat this step three times to completely collect the magnetically labeled cells.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
