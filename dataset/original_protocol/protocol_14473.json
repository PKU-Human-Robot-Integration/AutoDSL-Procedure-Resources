    "This protocol was approved by the Washington University Human Research Protection Office.\nNOTE: Instructions were written specific to commercially available accelerometers and their related software for data collection (see Table of Materials).\n1. Preparing the Accelerometers to Collect Data\nConnect the two accelerometers to the computer (via docking station) to charge their batteries; this will ensure recording during the entire wearing time.\nWith the accelerometers connected to the computer, open the appropriate software to initialize them.\nWithin the software, select 'Initialization' to synchronize the accelerometer clocks to each other and to the local computer, and set the data collection parameters as follows.\n\t\nEnter (or select from the calendar and clock) the start and end dates and times. Choose the start of data collection based on when the accelerometers will be placed on the participant and an end time at least 24 h later.\n\t\tNOTE: The single day wearing period provides a good representation of daily activity in non-employed adults.12 Longer wearing periods may be more appropriate for adults or children with varying daily schedules.3,18,26\nSelect '30 Hz' from the dropdown menu for 'Sampling Rate'.\nLeave 'LED Options' and 'Wireless Options' unchecked.\nTo extend battery life, enable 'Idle Sleep Mode'.\nTo complete the initialization process, select 'Enter Subject Info'.\nEnter subject specific information for the location of the accelerometer (wrist) and the body side ('Right' or 'Left').\nChoose to fill in other subject specific information as desired; entry will be for identification only and will not affect the data analyses described here.\nWhen ready, select 'Initialize Devices' to complete the process. Once initialization is confirmed, the accelerometers can be safely disconnected from the computer.\n2. Placement and Wearing of the Accelerometers to Collect Data from Participants\nPlace one accelerometer on each wrist of the participant.",
    "NOTE: The accelerometers should fit snuggly, but not too tightly to the wrist, like a large wrist watch. A variety of bands can be used depending on the size, preference, and comfort level of the participant.\nInstruct the participant as follows, and answer any questions the participant might have about the wearing period and activity during this time.\nAsk the participant to do their regular activities throughout the day; the accelerometers may feel strange at first but one soon gets used to them.\nInstruct them that the accelerometers are waterproof and can be worn while showering or doing the dishes. Instruct them to not wear the accelerometers during extended periods of swimming.\nAsk them to keep the accelerometers on during naps and overnight.\n\t\tNOTE: The accelerometers are labeled to identify the left and right sensors. If the accelerometers need to be removed during the wearing period, the labels help identify the correct side when putting them back on. Instruct users to write down on the wearing log when they were taken off and put back on again.The accelerometers are worn at night because, when we let people take them off, they often are not put back on, or are put back on the opposite limbs.\nSend the participant home with encouragement to engage in normal daily activities and instructions about when to take the two accelerometers off, and how to bring or mail back the accelerometers and wearing log.\n3. Download the Data for Visual Inspection\nWhen the accelerometers have been returned after a wearing period of 24 h or more, connect the accelerometers to the computer to download the recorded data.\nSelect 'Download' within the appropriate software and then choose a location to store the data on the computer using the 'Change Location' button.",
    "Select the option to 'Create AGD file'.\nFor files that are easy to view, choose '10 s' from the 'Epoch' dropdown box. Use these files in Step 3.3.\nSelect 'Download All Devices'.\nVisually inspect the data to confirm the accelerometers were worn for the planned time period and/or that the data matches the wearing log.\nFrom the top menu, click 'File | Open AGD File' and then select the files to open.\nLook at the 'Daily Graphs' to see the collected data.\nConfirm that activity occurred during typical waking hours and that there are not extended periods of no activity, except in the night time. The graphs can be scaled to focus in on smaller increments of time and scrolled through if desired.\n4. Download the Data for Processing\nRepeat the Download process (Step 3.2) but this time choose '1 s' from the 'Epoch' dropdown box. This will bin the data into 1 s epochs,10,11,12 and generate files that will be used for calculations.\n\tNOTE: The accelerometers and software used here (see Table of Materials) use proprietary software to filter out high frequency, non-human activity (e.g. accelerations from being in a car ride). Filtering may need to be done with custom-written software if using different devices and software. Custom-written software can also be used to identify and remove upper limb tremor, such as in a person with Parkinson Disease.\nFrom the 1 s files saved in Step 4.1, calculate a vector magnitude time series of the 3-dimensional data as the square root of (x2+y2+z2) from data from each accelerometer. This time series can then be used to calculate a number of variables to quantify upper limb activity during daily life.",
    "NOTE: The processing instructions assume a one day wearing period. If the wearing period is longer, data can be processed in separate single day chunks, or as a single time series with calculated variables adjusted by the by the length of the wearing period when appropriate.\n5. Variables and Graphical Representations Created from the Accelerometry Data\nNOTE: Upper limb movements associated with walking are included in the analyzed data. Previous work has established that walking does not influence the accelerometer ratio variables.15 Although inclusion of walking does not change the non-ratio variables for neurologically-intact adults,27 it is possible that the inclusion of walking could result in a small overestimation of the non-ratio variables for participants with stroke.\nCalculate hours of use of each limb by summing all the seconds during the recording period when the activity count was non-zero, and then converting to hours.12,17\n\tNOTE: This calculation yields one value for each limb.\nCalculate the use ratio (also called the activity ratio) by dividing the hours of use of the non-dominant limb (or affected limb) by the hours of use of the dominant (or non-affected) limb.\n\tNOTE: The use ratio quantifies the total duration of one limb's activity with respect to the other.12,15 This calculation yields a single value, typically between 0 and 1. A value of 1 indicates the two limbs are used for equal durations throughout the wearing period. A value of zero means that the non-dominant or affected limb was not used at all.\nCalculate the magnitude ratio as follows.\nFor each second of data in the time series, compute the natural log of the vector magnitude of the non-dominant limb (or affected limb) divided by the vector magnitude of the dominant (or non-affected) limb.",
    "Replace values greater than 7 and less than -7, with 7 and -7, respectively, to categorize single limb movement.11\n\t\tNOTE: The magnitude ratio quantifies the contribution of each limb to daily activity on a second-by-second basis.10,11 This is conceptually similar to the use ratio, but takes into account the intensity of movement (acceleration magnitude) of each limb during each second. This calculation yields a time series of values, where values of zero indicate both limbs had equal movement intensities during that instant in time. Positive values indicate greater movement intensity from the non-dominant (or affected) limb and negative values indicate greater movement intensity from the dominant (or unaffected) limb.\nCalculate the bilateral magnitude as the sum of the vector magnitude from the two limbs.\n\tNOTE: The bilateral magnitude quantifies the intensity of movement in both upper limbs on a second-by-second basis.10,11 This calculation yields a time series of values, where the value indicates the movement intensity, with higher values indicating high intensities.\nConstruct density plots to graphically represent the accelerometry data from both limbs11 as follows.\nPlot each second of data as a bivariate histogram with the frequency represented in color. Set the color scale such that cooler colors (blues) indicate less frequent activity and warmer colors (yellow through red) indicate more frequent activity.\nPlot the magnitude ratio, indicating the contribution one limb vs. the other, on the x-axis.\nPlot the bilateral magnitude, indicating the intensity of the movement, on the y-axis.\nPlot the single limb values as separate bars on the far left bar (-7), indicating activity of just the dominant (or unaffected) limb, and on the far right (7), indicating activity of just the non-dominant (or affected) limb.",
    "NOTE: The plots provide a context for scientists, clinicians, and participants to interpret two variables together, the magnitude ratio and the bilateral magnitude. An option to create density plots using accelerometry data is available here.44"
