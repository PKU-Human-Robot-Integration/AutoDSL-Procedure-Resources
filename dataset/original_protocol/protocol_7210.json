    "Yeast cell cultureRemove yeast glycerol stock from -80°C freezer and place in Styrofoam™ container containing a small amount of dry ice.Streak out a small amount of the glycerol stock onto a YPD agar plate.Incubate at 25°C for 3–5 days, until single yeast colonies appear on plate.Use a single colony to inoculate a 5-mL liquid culture of YPD media.Optional: To ensure you have a culture at the appropriate density the next day, one can set up multiple culture tubes the night before, each at a different dilution of cells. Incubate on a cell culture roller drum at 25°C for 16–18 h.Check cell density using a spectrophotometer, to determine if culture has reached mid log-phase growth (OD600 ~0.3).Cell fixation and phalloidin stainingStarting from a 37% formaldehyde stock, add a final concentration of 4.4% formaldehyde to cells, vortex, and incubate on the cell culture roller drum at 25°C for 45 min.Note: If fixing 5 mL of cell culture, use 595 µL of 37% formaldehyde. We recommend fixing the entire 5 mL culture, to avoid possibly physically stressing the cells during pipetting. Add 1 mL of fixed cells to a labelled 1.7-mL Eppendorf tube.Note: The remaining 4 mL of fixed cell culture can be washed, and stored at 4°C for later use. Pellet cells in a microcentrifuge (9,500 × g for 30 s).Decant supernatant, and add 500 µL of 1× PBS. Invert tube to resuspend pelleted cells.Repeat steps 3–4 two more times, to wash cells.After final wash, resuspend cells in ~50 µL of 1× PBS.Add 3 µL of 6.6 µM Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin or Alexa Fluor 568-phalloidin to a final concentration of ~0.4 µM (~1:16 dilution).Mix via pipetting.Incubate on a rotator or rocker to gently mix the sample at room temperature for a minimum of 4 h (or longer periods at 4°C).",
    "Wash cells with 500 µL of 1× PBS, re-pellet as above (step B3), and resuspend in ~20 µL of 1× PBS.Optional: To improve detection of the bud neck area during image analysis, label cell wall with fluorescently-conjugated Concanavalin A (Okada and Ohya, 2016). For details see Okada and Ohya (2016). Cell mounting and imagingClean microscope slide with 70% ethanol and KimWipe.Add 1 µL of stained cells to the center of the microscope slide.Add 1 µL of Vectashield (or other mounting media) to stained cells, and mix via pipetting.Add a 22 mm × 22 mm -1.5 coverslip on top.Note: The cell/mounting media suspension should spread to the edges of the coverslip. If it doesn’t, cells are likely to drift during imaging, making them unsuitable for analysis. Mount slide on microscope, and bring cells into focus using a 63×/1.4 Plan-Apochromat Oil objective lens.Note: The above objective lens is what we regularly use; however, other objective lenses (with a similar numerical aperture) should be suitable. Adjust acquisition settings for your specific microscope (laser power, exposure time, etc.), to acquire images with suitable dynamic range for quantification. It is necessary to empirically determine the optimal acquisition parameters for your microscope and sample. See Figure 1 for example acquisition parameters using a Zeiss 880 LSM with Airyscan.Note: While not necessary, we generally use super-resolution microscopy [e.g., structured illumination microscopy (SIM) or Airyscan] for image acquisition, as these imaging modalities produce superior detail in actin cable architecture. Acquire z-series images so that the entire volume of the cell(s) is captured in the stack.Note: The number of frames in the z-dimension required to capture the entire volume of the cell will depend on the size of the cells you are imaging. A typical haploid yeast cell will require approximately 30 frames acquired at 200 nm intervals. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.",
