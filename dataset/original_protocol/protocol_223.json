    "_**Isolation of thoracodorsal arteries \\(TDA):**_ \nFor a detailed protocol on isolation of the TDA please see \\(8).  A brief description of the dissection is outlined below: \n**Note:  During this procedure all tissues are constantly humidified with cold Krebs-HEPES supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin \\(BSA).**\n1. Euthanize a male C57Bl/6 mouse \\(8-10 weeks of age) by CO2 asphyxia and place in the lateral decubitus position at the surgical station.\n  2. Spray the right scapular area with 70% ethanol, make a 3 cm incision and carefully remove the skin to expose the latissimus dorsi muscle without affecting the superficial dorsal muscle underneath. \n  3. Remove the latissimus dorsi by microdissection to reveal the underlying TDA which feeds the spinotrapezius muscle.  The TDA is surrounded on both sides by veins.\n  4. Carefully isolate the TDA \\(~10 mm in length) by removing the surrounding fat tissue and veins and place it in cold Krebs-HEPES containing 1% BSA.\n  5. Repeat steps 1-4¬ for isolation of the left TDA.\n  • **It is important to isolate the TDA free of any branch points as the transfection protocol requires cannulation and pressurization of the artery.**\n_**Ex vivo endothelial cell transfection:**_\n6. Carefully transfer the isolated TDA to the bath chamber of the DMT pressure myograph.\n  7. Gently open each end of the artery with fine forceps to allow access to the lumen.\n  8. Position both ends of the artery over the opposing glass cannula in the bath chamber and secure with 10-0 nylon suture\n  Note: Ensure that there are no branch points in the cannulated artery.",
    "9. Perfuse the lumen of the cannulated artery with Krebs-HEPES buffer supplemented with 1% BSA to flush out red blood cells by increasing the inlet pressure \\(P1) to 40 mmHg while leaving the outlet pressure \\(P2) at 0 mmHg \\(Fig 1A).  This pressure drop will induce flow through the vessel lumen.\n  10. Gently remove the P1 tubing from the pressure transducer box and the P1 glass cannula supporting the vessel without disturbing the artery \\(see schematic in Fig 2).  \n  11. Mix 82 µL of HCAEC Nucleofection™ solution with 18 µL of Supplement 4 \\(HCAEC Nucleofector kit, Lonza) and dilute the control on targeted siRNA to a desired final concentration.\n  12. Using a small syringe, inject 100 µL of Nucleofector™ transfection reagent with siRNA into the P1 tubing until the solution reaches the end of the tubing and there are no air bubbles.\n  13. Reconnect the tubing containing siRNA and Nucleofector™ transfection reagent to the P1 outlet of the pressure transducer box and to the P1 glass cannula supporting the artery.  Be sure to minimize disturbance of the cannulated artery to avoid mechanical stress to the tissue.\n  14. Perfuse the artery lumen with the Nucleofector™ transfection reagent containing siRNA by increasing the P1 pressure to 40 mmHg while maintaining the P2 pressure at 0 mmHg \\(Fig 1B). \n  15. Quickly, remove the artery from the cannula while simultaneously tying off both ends with 10-0 nylon suture to ensure that the siRNA and Nucleofector™ transfection reagent remain in the lumen of the artery \\(Fig 1C).",
    "16. Gently transfer the ligated artery to an electroporation cuvette containing 100 uL Nucleofector transfection reagent \\(82 µL Nucleofection™ solution and 18 µL Supplement 4) WITHOUT siRNA.  Be sure that the artery is surrounded by transfection reagent at the bottom of the cuvette and is not exposed to air.\n  17. Electroporate the artery using program A-034 on the Nucleofector™ 2b device \\(Fig 1D).\n  18. Quickly and gently remove the artery from the electroporation cuvette by flushing the cuvette with 1 mL of Krebs-HEPES buffer containing 1% BSA and transfer the artery to the bath chamber in the cannulation rig.\n  19. Remove the sutures from both ends of the transfected artery and re-cannulate on the P1 and P2 glass cannula.  Secure the artery with new 10-0 nylon sutures.\n  20. Flush the artery lumen with Krebs-HEPES buffer containing 1% BSA by increasing the P1 pressure to 40 mmHg while maintaining the P2 pressure at 0 mmHg \\(Fig 1E).\n  21. Perfuse the vessel lumen with pre-warmed \\(37°C) RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% L-glutamine and 1% BSA \\(Fig 1F).\n  22. Gently remove the artery from the glass cannula and transfer to a sterile culture dish containing RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% L-glutamine and 1% BSA.\n  23. Culture the transfected vessel for 18-24 hours at 37°C in a humidified cell culture incubator."
