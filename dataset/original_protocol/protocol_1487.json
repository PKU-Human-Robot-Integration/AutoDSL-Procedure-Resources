    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nHere we describe two methods to assess CRISPR-Cas9-generated mutations. The MiSeq250 method can characterize both NHEJ- and HDR-generated mutations such as point mutations, and short insertions and deletions. The LNA probe qPCR described here requires prior knowledge of the kind of mutations expected such as those generated by HDR, or identified by MiSeq or by other sequencing methods. Both methods require extraction and preparation of very high-quality DNA.\nDNA extraction\nTiming: 20 h\nThe procedure below describes high-yield purification of genomic DNA from mouse tissues.\nClip ∼0.5 cm of mouse tail, or other tissue, e.g., ear punch, in compliance with procedures approved by the institute's animal care and handling guidelines and research animal protocols.\nAdd 200 μL DirectPCR Lysis Reagent containing freshly prepared Proteinase K (0.25–0.5 mg/mL).\nNote: Although 200 μl DirectPCR is usually sufficient for complete lysis of ∼0.5 cm tail, poor DNA recovery can be improved by increasing the lysis reagent to 300 μl to give better mixing efficiency.\nIncubate tubes for 16 h at 55°C.\nOptional: For increased DNA yields, rotate tubes in rotating hybridization oven.\nInactivate Proteinase K by incubating tubes at 85°C for 45 min.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 g for 30 s to remove tissue debris.\nAdd NaCl to a final concentration of 250 mM, and then add 0.7 volume of isopropanol.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 g for 5 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant.\nWash the DNA pellet with 1 mL of 70% ethanol. Centrifuge at 12,000 g for 5 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nAir-dry the pellet for 5–10 min at 22°C. Dissolve in 100 μL of nuclease-free water.",
    "Determine DNA concentration, and 260/280 nm and 260/230 nm ratios by Nanodrop. A 260/280 nm ratio of 1.8 and a 260/230 nm ratio of 2.0–2.2 is considered to be high-quality DNA with low protein contamination. Dilute DNA to 225 ng/μL and store at −20°C. (See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting])\nPause point: DNA can be stored at −20°C without significant reduction in quality.\nNote: Genomic DNA also can be isolated by Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.qiagen.com/br/products/top-sellers/dneasy-blood-and-tissue-kit/[href=https://www.qiagen.com/br/products/top-sellers/dneasy-blood-and-tissue-kit/]).\nCritical: Crude DNA extracts from rapid protocols, e.g., from heat-inactivated tissue lysates (Tail/toe/ear lysis buffer with Proteinase K) may not work reliably.\nGeneration of amplicon for MiSeq250\nTiming: 4 h\nThe following steps describe amplification of target loci for MiSeq250 using Phusion DNA polymerase.\nAssemble all reaction components on ice.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1030_1.csv\nNote: Because Phusion DNA polymerase has 3′→ 5′ exonuclease activity, it is critical to add the polymerase last to prevent primer degradation. The volume of genomic DNA added should be less than 20% of the total reaction volume to increase PCR yield.\nNote: 5× Phusion HF Buffer and 5× Phusion GC Buffer are provided with the enzyme. The protocol describes use of HF buffer. For GC-rich templates or primers with secondary structure, GC buffer can improve reaction performance.\nGently mix the reaction components. Do a quick spin to collect the components at the tube bottom.\nTransfer PCR tubes from ice to a preheated PCR instrument with heated lid, and begin thermocycling with the following conditions:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1030_2.csv\nTransfer PCR tubes to ice and run the PCR products on a 1% (wt/vol) agarose gel. (See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting])\nPurify the PCR product using a PCR purification kit, according to the manufacturers’ instructions (https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/qiaquick-pcr-purification-kit/[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/qiaquick-pcr-purification-kit/]).",
    "The PCR products are processed by a genomic service (https://case.edu/medicine/genomics/[href=https://case.edu/medicine/genomics/]) for secondary PCR involving barcode addition followed by MiSeq. Barcoding refers to addition of unique indices involving short sequence of DNA to the PCR fragments during library preparation. This step allows for multiple libraries to be pooled and sequenced simultaneously during a sequencing run, i.e., multiplexing. The sequencing reads from the pooled libraries are sorted based on the barcode sequence, i.e., demultiplexing. We used a genomics core service with a MiSeq v3 flow cell as a Paired-End (PE) 250 cycle run, i.e., 250 cycles in each direction or 500 cycles total are sequenced.\nAlternatives: Other MiSeq run modes are compatible with CRISPR edit detection such as PE 75 cycles or PE 150 cycles based on the region of interest, length of amplicon, and the services available.\nMiSeq250 data analysis\nTiming: 5 h\nAnalysis of reads from next-generation sequencing is done using Cas-Analyzer (Park et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) available at http://www.rgenome.net/cas-analyzer/[href=http://www.rgenome.net/cas-analyzer/]. Alternate platforms supporting next-generation sequencing datasets, e.g., CRISPResso2, can be used.\nThe format of the raw output data from the MiSeq platform is usually FastQ or gzip-compressed, and both data types are accepted by Cas-Analyzer. Download FastQ files for both reads to a local folder.\nInput parameters:\nUpload sequencing data.\nSelect nuclease type → single nuclease.\nSelect nuclease → from the appropriate drop-down menu. In our study, SpCas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes: 5′-NGG-3′ was selected.\nTarget DNA sequence → input the sgRNA sequence used for CRISPR-Cas9 from 5′ to 3′ without the PAM sequence.\nInput donor DNA sequence → enter the donor sequence used for HDR. This is an optional parameter to analyze recombined sequences.",
    "Input comparison range. The default is 70 and can be changed to limit the query sequence comparison to the specified number with the input sequence. (See troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting])\nInput minimum frequency. The default is 1 and can be changed to filter the number of reads below the set threshold.\nLNA probe qPCR\nTiming: 4 h\nBefore you begin, see ‘materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]’ for preparation of Genotyping Master Mix and 20× Probe mix.\nThe following steps describe allelic discrimination using the StepOne plus qPCR system. (See troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting])\nPrepare the reaction mix.\nDetermine number of reactions to be performed for each assay, including positive and negative controls.\nTest samples – samples of unknown genotype.\nNo-template control – DNase-free water (two reactions per plate) to correct for background fluorescence.\nPositive control – positive controls for each allele. (See troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting])\nAdd following components for each reaction:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1030_3.csv\nNote: Allow 10% overage to account for pipetting errors and to avoid air bubbles.\nBriefly vortex.\nQuickspin the tubes to remove air bubbles.\nPrepare the reaction plate.\nDilute each DNA sample, including controls, in nuclease-free water to 22.25 ng/μL and add 4.5 μL per well.\nNote: All wells using the probe assay must contain same amount of DNA. A final concentration of at least 20 ng/well is recommended.\nAdd 5.5 μL of reaction mix to each well of the 96-well plate.\nSeal the plate with adhesive film, then centrifuge briefly to remove air bubbles and to drive the reaction mix to the bottom.\nNote: Use a compression pad or other sealer to firmly seal the optical film.\nPerform qPCR.\nInstrument and set-up properties using StepOne Software v2.3.\nSelect the instrument type and the plate format (e.g., 96-well).\nChoose genotyping as experiment type.",
