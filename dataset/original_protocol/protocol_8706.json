    "Ethics statement: The animal experiment protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at KIST animal protocol 2014-001.\n1. Equipment Setup\nImaging setup\n\t\nPlace an inverted fluorescence microscope on a vibration isolation table. Use a high magnification (60X oil immersion lens with 1.35 numerical aperture) objective lens and a filter cube equipped with a dichroic mirror and filters suitable for the fluorescent proteins used for the voltage imaging.\n\t\tNote: This setup uses an inverted microscope in order to employ objectives with higher NA, but upright microscopes can also be used. Indeed, the inverted microscope is only for probe development since higher numerical aperture (NA) objective lens collects more light than the one with a low NA thereby improving the signal to noise ratio (SNR; can be described as the peak optical signal divided by the standard deviation of the baseline fluorescence) of the recording. For non-developers, we would recommend an upright microscope for applications such as slice or in vivo recordings.\nPrepare a light source, e.g., Xenon arc lamp, equipped with a mechanical shutter for efficient epifluorescence wide-field imaging. Direct the light to the microscope via a light guide mount. The light will pass through the excitation filter and is reflected by the first dichroic mirror in the filter cube. Align the light to illuminate the specimen evenly with maximized light intensity over the field of view 21.\n\t\tNote: Traditionally, a 75 watt arc lamp was used since higher wattage light bulbs create larger but not brighter illumination fields. Lasers can be used but are restricted to a single wavelength. LEDs are becoming brighter and may indeed be the light source of choice offering multiple wavelengths and not requiring a mechanical shutter.\nMount the two CCD cameras to the fluorescence microscope as shown in Figure 2D.",
    "Note: The first CCD camera has high spatial resolution and is used for identification of a cell expressing the GEVI in the plasma membrane to be tested. For imaging changes in membrane potential, ensure that the second CCD camera has a high frame rate such as 1,000 frame per sec (fps). Use a dual port camera adapter (Figure 2D-(3)) to switch the imaging pathway between the two CCD cameras. In this setup, a demagnifier is used to fit the image from the objective lens onto the CCD chip in the second CCD camera. \nInstall an image splitter between the first (slow) and second (fast) CCD cameras for imaging of FRET based GEVI. Insert a filter cube having a dichroic mirror (560 nm) and two emission filters (520 nm/40 & 645 nm/75) in the image splitter. This will result in two fields of view, one for the donor fluorescence and the other representing the acceptor fluorescence. Remove this second filter cube when imaging a GEVI with a single FP.",
    "Note: The single FP based GEVI tested in this method is Bongwoori which uses the FP, super ecliptic pHluorin A227D (SE A227D). The excitation filter (472 nm/30), emission filter (497 nm/long pass) and the dichroic mirror (495 nm) were selected based on its excitation and emission spectra 5. Generally, the excitation and emission filters should have the largest overlap with each spectrum of the fluorophore to acquire a bright image while the dichroic mirror blocks any excitation light transmitted through the emission filter. The selection of filters and dichroic mirrors for the FRET pair 11 based GEVI recording follows the same principle except that it necessitates a second filter cube in the image splitter for concurrent observation of donor and acceptor fluorescence. The first filter cube placed in the microscope filter box needs to have an excitation filter (475 nm/23) for Clover. Then the emitted fluorescence from both FPs will be transmitted to the second filter cube through the first dichroic mirror (495 nm). The second filter cube has a dichroic mirror (560 nm) and two emission filters (520 nm/40 for Clover and 645 nm/75 for mRuby2) for each FP thus separating the fluorescence from two different FPs.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\n,,Single FP based GEVI  (Bongwoori),FRET pair based GEVI  (Nabi 2.42 & Nabi 2.44)\nFirst filter cube placed in the microscope,excitation filter,472 nm/30,475 nm/23\nFirst filter cube placed in the microscope,dichroic mirror,495 nm,495 nm\nFirst filter cube placed in the microscope,emission filter,497 nm/long pass,-\nSecond filter cube placed in the beam splitter,dichroic mirror,-,560 nm\nSecond filter cube placed in the beam splitter,emission filter 1,-,520 nm/40\nSecond filter cube placed in the beam splitter,emission filter 2,-,645 nm/75\nTable 1.

    "Do not mount any equipment with moving components on the vibration isolation table. Ensure that the cables that are attached to non-isolated equipment are loose to avoid vibration of the sample.\nPatch clamp chamber\n\t\nSeal the bottom of the patch clamp chamber with a thin #0 cover glass since the working distance of the objective is relatively small. This is a disadvantage of the inverted microscope setup.\n\t\tNote: As a tradeoff of having a high NA objective lens, the working distance decreases. In order to place the specimen within the very short working distance, the cover glass and the coverslip (step 2) need to be as thin as possible.\nTemperature control\n\t\nEnsure that the bath solution flows through a temperature controller to maintain the patched-cells around 33 oC throughout the experiment.\nEquipment connections\n\t\nConnect the patch clamp amplifier and the mechanical shutter of the light source to the Bayonet Neill-Concelman (BNC) command box of the high speed CCD camera. This will enable the imaging software to control the amplifier, camera, and the light source simultaneously.\n\t\tNote: The electrical and imaging components need to be synchronized in order to provide for simultaneous electrical and optical recordings of electrical activity.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53566/53566fig2.jpg",

Expression of GEVIs\nIn Human Embryonic Kidney 293 cells\n\t\nCulture Human Embryonic Kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells with Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 oC in a CO2 incubator (5% CO2). Use a tissue culture dish with 100 mm diameter and 20 mm height. Start the culture with 2 x 103 - 6 x 103 cells/cm2 and incubate until they reach 80-90% confluency for subsequent transfection.",
    "On the day of transfection, aspirate the cell media and gently wash once with Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline. Disperse the HEK 293 cells with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution for 1-2 min, aspirate the solution and gently tap the side of the dish to detach the cells. Add fresh DMEM (10% FBS) and dissociate the clumped cells by pipetting. Determine the cell concentration by using a hemocytometer.\nPlace 0.08 - 0.13 mm thick, 10 mm diameter coverslips pre-coated with poly-L-lysine in a 24-well tissue culture plate. Seed the HEK 293 cells on coverslips at 1 x 105 cells / cm2 cell density.\n\t\tNote: Since HEK 293 cells are capable of forming gap junctions with each other, the seed number needs to yield isolated cells.\nTransiently transfect the cells with an appropriate gene construct encoding a GEVI by using a lipofection reagent following the manufacturer's instruction.\n\t\tNote: The gene constructs used for this step utilized pcDNA3.1 (Bongwoori) and pUB2.1 (Nabi 2.242) as backbone vectors. The amount of DNA used was 100 ng for each coverslip; however, transfection conditions need to be empirically determined for each GEVI to be tested. \nIn dissociated mouse hippocampal primary neurons\n\t\nDissect hippocampi from embryonic day 17 C57BL6/N mice and then dissociate the hippocampal neurons as previously described 22,23.\nPlate the dissociated neurons onto poly-D-lysine coated 0.08-0.13 mm thick, 10 mm diameter coverslips at 1 x 105 cells/ml cell density. Incubate the cells at 37 oC in CO2 incubator (5% CO2).\nTransfect the dissociated neurons transiently at 6 - 7 days in vitro (DIV) with a gene construct encoding a GEVI by using a calcium phosphate transfection reagent as previously described 24.",
    "Note: The gene constructs used for this step utilized pcDNA3.1 (Bongwoori) and pUB2.1 (Nabi 2.244) as backbone vectors. The amount of DNA used was 1 µg for each coverslip. Again, transfection conditions need to be empirically determined for each GEVI tested. \nCheck the expression level prior to voltage imaging\n\t\nTake the tissue culture plate from the CO2 incubator and observe the fluorescence from the transfected cells under an epifluorescence microscope.\nAfter confirming the fluorescence from the membrane, transfer the coverslip to the patching chamber for the voltage imaging in section 3.\n\t\tNote: The voltage imaging is conducted 16 - 24 hr post transfection. However, as different fluorescent proteins have different maturation times, some GEVIs need more time in post transfection. For instance, the FRET pairs containing mRuby2 in this protocol may take longer to express since the maturation of mRuby2 takes significantly longer than Clover11. The fluorescence of both donor and acceptor should be checked.\n3. Voltage Imaging Protocol\nChoose a healthy cell with good membrane expression\n\t\nUsing microscopy, find a healthy cell (Figure 4B) that shows strong membrane localized fluorescence compared to internal fluorescence. Try not to patch rounded cells. Circular cells are either dividing or dying and are difficult to patch. Apply a test pulse of 5.0 mV in amplitude and 5.0 msec in duration to aid subsequent patch clamp experiments.\nPrepare the cell for voltage imaging\n\t\nAfter choosing a cell to patch, place the patch clamp pipette above the cell. Bring the pipette down until it gently touches the cell membrane. At this step, observe 1 MΩ - 2 MΩ rise in membrane resistance on the patch clamp software 25. \n\t\tNOTE: Occasionally, a good giga-ohm seal can occur simply by touching the cell membrane. As long as the giga-ohm seal is stable, it should be OK.",
    "Establish a giga-ohm seal by gently applying negative pressure through the pipette. Set the pipette potential at a desired holding potential.\nWhile maintaining the giga-ohm seal, image the cell with the high speed CCD camera and focus it to the membrane area.\nRupture the cell membrane by applying pulses of suction by mouth or syringe gently to make a whole cell configuration 26.\nImage the patch clamped cell under a whole cell clamp configuration according to the experimental design by using an imaging software\n\t\t\nStart the imaging software. Click [ACQUIRE] - [SciMeasure Camera] menu to open up the 'CCD ACQUIRE' page.\nCreate a new data file to save the images.\nClick [ANALOGUE OUTPUT] and then [Read an ASCII] to open up a pulse protocol file to conduct the imaging. Click on 'Average the internal repetitions' if the data needs to be averaged. Then close the 'ANALOGUE OUTPUT' page.\n\t\t\tNote: This pulse protocol needs to be designed and saved as a '.txt' file according to the purpose of each experiment prior to this step.   \nSet specific acquisition parameters from the 'CCD ACQUIRE' page. Input the specific values for 'Number of frames for acquisition' and 'Number of trials'.\n\t\t\tNote: The number of frames is determined by the speed of the acquisition and the timing of the pulse protocol. For instance, if imaging at 1 kHz, 1,000 frames equals 1 sec of recording time.\nClick [TAKE DATA (Optics + BNC)] button to start the recording. While the voltage imaging is taking place, watch the oscilloscope window from the patch clamp software to ensure stable whole cell configuration throughout the recording.",
    "Note: To test the GEVI's responsive voltage range, signal size in ΔF/F value or temporal resolution throughout the physiological voltage range, conduct a whole cell voltage clamp experiment with a pulse protocol having stepped voltage pulses ranging from -170 mV to 130 mV. To determine the GEVI's performance in resolving action potentials evoked from cultured primary neurons, image the cell under a whole cell current clamp configuration.\n4. Data Acquisition\nCalculation of ΔF/F\n\t\nStart the imaging software. Click [FILE] - [Read Data File] to open up a data file to be analyzed. Observe the cell image in its Resting Light Intensity (RLI) on the right side\n\t\tNote: The software averages the first 5 frames to determine RLI of the recording.  \nClick on 'Show BNCs' to bring the current and voltage values measured to the screen.\nChange the page mode from 'RLI frame' to 'Frame subtraction' to utilize the frame subtraction function to identify pixels with responsive optical signals. This is the true power of imaging since every pixel can be examined for potential changes in fluorescence.\nSelect two time points (F0 and F1) for subtraction. Identify which area of the cell is showing signals responsive to membrane potential change.\n\t\tNote: The SNR for the frame subtraction images can be improved by selecting multiple frames for each time point to temporally average the signal. The software subtracts the average light intensity taken from selected frames and calculates the F1-F0 values (ΔF). Usually one chooses a time point acquired at the holding potential and another time point taken during the stimulation period.",
    "Designate the pixels that need to be analyzed by dragging or clicking each pixel with the computer mouse. Observe the graphical representation of the average fluorescence intensity from the selected pixels on the left side of the software window. Figures 4B & 5B show representative images from the frame subtraction analysis.\nDivide the subtracted pixels by the RLI (F0). Click [Divide by RLIs] to acquire ΔF/F values\nExport data\n\t\nCalculate ΔF/F values for each voltage step to further analyze the GEVI's voltage sensing properties. Use these values to draw graphs such as ΔF/F versus voltage for subsequent data analyses.\nRemove current and voltage graphs by unclicking 'Show BNCs' menu. Go to [OUTPUT] -[Save Traces As Displayed (ASCII)] to export the fluorescence trace in an ASCII file format for curve fitting analysis by standard graphing software.\n5. Data Analysis\nVoltage sensing property of the GEVI\n\t\nDraw the fluorescence change versus voltage graph (F-V) by plotting the ΔF/F values versus voltage in a data analysis program. Fit the curve to a Boltzmann function (Table 2) to determine the voltage range of the optical signal by clicking [Analysis] - [Fitting] - [Sigmoidal fit] - [Open dialog], and then choose Boltzmann function.\n\t\tNote: Fitting to a function makes it possible to characterize the voltage sensing properties of different voltage probes or to compare their performances in different cells. The Boltzmann function can be used for the probes tested in this paper because the F-V curves from these probes show sigmoidal pattern.\nNormalize each ΔF/F value by using the initial and final values (A1 and A2) calculated by the function.",
    "Note: In the Boltzmann equation, the minimum is A1 and the maximum is A2. For normalization, use a spreadsheet application software to adjust the ΔF/F values by defining A1 as zero and A2 as one. Average the normalized ΔF/F values and calculate standard error for statistical analysis.\nReplot the normalized ΔF/F values versus voltage as previously described in section 5.1.1).\nThe speed of the optical response\n\t\nOpen the ASCII file acquired from step 4.2.2) with a data analysis program and plot the ΔF/F trace versus time.\nClick on 'Data selector' in the data analysis software and select one time point corresponding to the beginning of a stepped voltage pulse and a second time point when the optical signal has reached the steady-state. Fit this range to both a single and double exponential decay function by clicking [Analysis] - [Fitting] - [Exponential fit] - [Open dialog], and choose an exponential decay function. Report the better fit.\n\t\tNote: By fitting to the single or double exponential decay functions, the quantified time constants represented by τ can be acquired. This will help experimenters compare the kinetics of their measurements done with different voltage indicators. The fluorescence trace might show fast and slow components that can be described with a double exponential decay function. In this case, the calculation will result in two time constants with different amplitudes.\nCalculate the weighted τ constants to compare the kinetics of probes exhibiting two temporal components to probes with a single component.\n\t\tNote: A weighted tau is calculated as the sum of τ1 multiplied by the relative amplitude, A1, plus τ2 multiplied by the relative amplitude, A2, as defined by the following formula;imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53566/53566eq1.jpg\nSubscription Required.
