    "All animal procedures are in accordance with Directive 2010/63/EU and have been approved by the Institutional Animal Welfare Body and licensed by DGAV, the Portuguese competent authority for animal protection (license number 023861/2013)\nCAUTION: Several of the chemicals used in the protocols are toxic and harmful. Please use all appropriate safety practices and personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coat, full-length pants, and closed-toe shoes)\n1. The murine model of hindlimb ischemia\nNOTE: All experiments are performed on 22-week-old C57BL/6 female mice.\nPreparation of solutions\nPreparation of the anesthetic solution\n\t\tNote: This anesthetic combination (medetomidine and ketamine) provides up to 30 min immobilization and a surgical window of 15 min. The effect may be reverted by the administration of atipamezole.\n\t\t\nWith a clean, 1cc syringe, withdraw 1 mL of medetomidine (1 mg/Kg body weight), eliminate air bubbles for accurate measurements, and add it to a 15 mL falcon tube.\nWith a clean, 1 cc syringe, withdraw 0.75 mL of Ketamine (75 mg/Kg body weight), eliminate air bubbles for accurate measurements and add it to a 15 mL falcon tube containing the medetomidine.\nAdd 8.25 mL of sterile saline (0.9% NaCl), in order to obtain 10 mL of anesthetic solution.\nIdentify the tube with the name of the compounds, the date mixed and the expiration date.\nStore in the dark at 4 °C.\nPreparation of the anti-sedative solution\nWith a clean, 1 cc syringe, withdraw 1 mL of atipamezole (5 mg/Kg body weight), eliminate air bubbles for accurate measurements, and add it to a 15 mL falcon tube.\nAdd 9 mL of sterile saline (0.9% NaCl), in order to obtain 10 mL of reversion solution.\nIdentify the tube with the name of the compounds, the date mixed and the expiration date.\nStore in the dark at 4 °C.",
    "Preparation of the post-operative analgesia solution\nWith a clean, 1 cc syringe, withdraw 0.5 mL of buprenorphine (100 µL/15-30 g body weight), eliminate air bubbles for accurate measurements, and add it to a 15 mL falcon tube.\nAdd 9.5 mL of sterile saline (0.9% NaCl), in order to obtain 10 mL of analgesia solution.\nIdentify the tube with the name of the compounds, the date mixed and the expiration date.\nStore in the dark at 4 °C.\nSurgical induction of hindlimb ischemia\nSurgical tools needed for this intervention: pointed forceps, spring scissors, ophthalmic needle holder, surgical scissors and a needle holder. Sterilize all surgical tools in an autoclave before use. Use cotton swabs for the dissection of subcutaneous fat.\nLoad the syringe with the anesthesia solution before holding the mouse.\nRestrain the animal by applying force behind its ears against the cage’s grid, holding as much skin as possible to keep the mouse immobile.\nKeep the animal tilted with its head lowered and perform an intraperitoneal injection of the anesthesia solution, keeping the syringe at a 45° angle with the mouse’s body.\nCheck for the absence of pedal withdrawal reflexes, to evaluate the depth of anesthesia.\nRemove the hair from the right hindlimb using an electric shaver. Use a chlorhexidine disinfectant soap scrub for skin preparation. Use a clean paper towel to remove the suds. Apply a chlorhexidine surgical scrub and protect the skin area with a sterile drape before transporting the mice to the surgical sterile suite.\nPlace the animal in dorsal decubitus and restrain it with the four limbs spread apart and secured with tape.\n\t\tCAUTION: Perform the procedure on a heated pad to keep the animal’s body temperature stable; the surgical procedure is performed using a dissection microscope at 10x or 20x magnification.",
    "Apply a chlorhexidine antiseptic solution using sterile gauze to finalize skin preparation. Using a number 11 surgical scalpel blade perform a 1-cm skin incision overlying the thigh of the right hindlimb.\nBlunt dissect subcutaneous fat exposing the neurovascular bundle. Using the pointed forceps, the spring scissors and the ophthalmic needle holder, open the membranous ilio-femoral sheath to expose the distal external iliac and femoral vessels.\nDissect and separate the vessels (artery and vein) from the nerve. Using a 7.0 non-absorbable polypropylene suture ligate the distal external iliac artery and vein and the distal femoral artery and vein.\nTransect the segment of the ilio-femoral artery and veins between the distal and proximal knots with the spring scissors.\nClose the incision with an absorbable suture (e.g., 5.0 Vicryl suture).\nLoad the syringe with the anti-sedative solution and use the same method detailed in 1.2.3 and 1.2.4 to perform an intraperitoneal injection of the anti-sedative solution.\nPost-operative monitoring\n\tNOTE: Animals are carefully observed every 15-20 min to make sure all animals recover well from the anti-sedative; anesthetized animals are never left unattended.\n\t\nAssess the recovery from anesthesia: 1) monitor the rate and depth of respiration; 2) assess animal reflexes (pedal and eye position)\nPerform a subcutaneous injection of the post-operative analgesia every 8-12 h.\nMonitor the animals daily after the surgery recording a brief description of the animal’s health status and surgery site appearance, ensure all sutures are closed.\nRe-suture the incision, if dehiscence occurs. If unsuccessful, apply a skin barrier film on the incision to protect from urine, fecal excretions, friction and shear of the skin and to help the healing process.\n2. Assessment of the angiogenic effect",
    "NOTE: After ischemia induction, apply the therapeutic agent in the study and achieve the following procedures. Steps undertaken at other time points are detailed under the corresponding section.\nLaser Doppler perfusion imaging\nRemove the hair from both hindlimbs one day before the analysis using an electrical shaver followed by depilatory cream.\nAnesthetize the mice using the anesthetic solution.\nPlace the animal on a 37 °C heating pad for 5 min to ensure that temperature will not change during the procedure\nPlace the animal in the supine position with legs secured in an extended position. Measure the distance between right and left legs and feet for each animal since the positioning of the animal should be similar whenever the procedure must be repeated in order to follow changes in hindlimb perfusion over time.\nStart acquiring data by using a laser Doppler perfusion imager.\nAfter the acquisition is complete, revert the anesthesia with the anti-sedative solution.\nOpen the image analysis software and draw the region of interest (ROI) around the ischemic hindlimb and a comparable ROI around the non-ischemic hindlimb.\nObserve the flux values and determine the perfusion as a ratio of the perfusion in the ischemic limb to that in the non-ischemic limb. Changes in the perfusion ratio are measured over time. \nImmunohistochemistry and capillary density analysis\nAfter anesthetizing, sacrifice the mice by cervical dislocation.\nTo harvest the gastrocnemius muscles of both legs, first, remove the skin from both hindlimbs.\nIdentify the Achilles tendon and separate the tendon from the bone using an 11-blade scalpel.\nHold the Achilles tendon and separate the muscle from the tibia and fibula up to the knee joint with spring scissors.\nSeparate the biceps femoris from the gastrocnemius muscle.\nUse spring scissors to cut the insertions of the gastrocnemius muscles at the knee joint level.",

For all incubations use 100 µL of all solutions, per section.\nApply a blocking solution of 5% rabbit serum in PBS for 30 min at room temperature.\nIncubate the specimens for 1 h at room temperature with anti-CD31 rat monoclonal antibody diluted at 1:500 in 1 % bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS.\nWash three times in PBS for a total of 30 min.\nAdd a secondary biotinylated rabbit anti-rat IgG antibody at 1:200 in 1% BSA in PBS and 5% rabbit serum for 30 min at room temperature.\nWash in PBS as before and add labeled avidin-conjugated peroxidase complex for 30 min at room temperature.\nRinse 3 times in PBS for 5 min and add diaminobenzidine (DAB) peroxidase substrate kit for another 5 min.\nCounterstain the sections with hematoxylin for 10 s before mounting.\nMeasure the capillary densities by using an upright brightfield microscope (i.e., number of capillaries per number of myocytes) in 2 different sections of 4 distinct anatomic areas in each specimen.\nContrast agent perfusion",
    "Anesthetize the mice using the anesthetic solution.\nPerform a median laparotomy using a number 15 scalpel blade.\nExpose the abdominal aorta and the caudal vena cava, after retracting laterally the small bowel and using spring scissors.\nInsert one 26-gauge catheter cranially into the abdominal aorta and another into the caudal vena cava in the same direction.\nSecure catheters in place using a 5/0 silk suture to perform a stay suture.\nWash the vascular system with a 37 °C saline solution containing heparin (500 units/100 mL) pushed into the abdominal aorta using a 10 mL syringe. Continue gentle perfusion until a clear solution is seen coming out of the catheter placed inside the caudal vena cava.\n\t\tNOTE: Usually 30 to 40 mL of a heparinized saline solution are required to rinse the vascular system of an adult rat.\nAdminister a mixture of adenosine (1 mg/L) and papaverine (4 mg/L) for 2 min.\nInject into the aortic catheter 10 mL of a mixture of 50% barium sulfate and 5% gelatine.\n\t\tNOTE: The solution must be kept at 60 °C to avoid thickening.\nLeave the mice at - 4 °C for at least 4 h, in order to allow the vascular cast to solidify.\nRemove the skin from the lower body of each mouse.\nDiaphonization - Spalteholz technique\nFix the mice by immersion in a 10% formaldehyde solution for at least 72 h.\nBleach the mice by immersion in a 30% hydrogen peroxide solution for 24 h.\nDehydrate the mice using the freeze substitution technique. This methodology consists of submitting the mice to successive passages (on average four) of pure acetone at - 20 °C for 24 h each.",
    "Clarify the mice by immersing it in a solution containing a mixture of 100% benzyl benzoate and 100% methyl salicylate in a 3:5 proportion (this mixture is also known as Spalteholz solution) 13.\nLeave the mice immersed in the Spalteholz solution inside in a vacuum chamber until it becomes diaphanous, which usually takes 5 to 7 days.\nReplace the solution, if it becomes dark before the specimen becomes clear.\nCollateral vessels quantification\nObserve the mice suspended in the Spalteholz solution under transillumination using a stereotaxic microscope. Use microsurgery forceps to gently grasp and move it.\nPhotograph the entire limbs using a digital camera connected to the microscope.\nObtain entire limb photographs by using the appropriate software.\nPerform a manual segmentation of the collateral vessels by highlighting them using the appropriate software.\n\t\tNOTE: Collateral vessels are defined according to Longland’s definition, a defined stem, mid-zone, and re-entrant, with a diameter between 20 and 300 µm, excluding femoral, saphenous and popliteal arteries and all venous structures.\nDefine ROIs in every mouse in the same anatomic region in the adductor, surrounding and below the surgical occlusion.\nQuantify the collateral vessel density (CVD) in equivalent ROIs corresponding to 20% of the total limb area. The CVD is calculated as the ratio between the vascular area and the ROIs areas. All density measurements are performed using ImageJ software.\n\t\tNOTE: The CVD value of the non-ischemic limb for each mouse is assumed to correspond to 100% to exclude variations in the anatomy, perfusion or diaphonization procedures. The CVD percentage in the ischemic limb was, therefore, calculated relative to the non-ischemic one.\nDetermine the percentage of CVD increase as the difference between the CVD percentage among the ischemic and nonischemic limbs.\nLaser capture microdissection of capillaries\nAfter anesthetizing, sacrifice the mice by cervical dislocation.",
