    "1. Cloning and protein expression\nClone the human ABCG5/G8 gene into Pichia pastoris yeast following previous protocols25,26. Briefly, derive pSGP18 and pLIC expression vectors from pPICZB. Add a tag that encodes a rhinovirus 3C protease site followed by a calmodulin binding peptide (CBP) to the C-terminus of ABCG8 cDNA (pSGP18-G8-3C-CBP).\n\t\nAdd a six-histidine tag separated by a glycine (His6GlyHis6) to the C-terminus of ABCG5 cDNA (pLIC-G5-H12). Co-transform the plasmids into Pichia strain KM71H using electroporation.\n\t\tNOTE: Please see the Table of Materials for the details of the plasmids, media and buffers used.\nGrow transformed yeast cells on MD agar plates at 28 °C.\nAfter 1-2 days, select 10-12 colonies and inoculate them into 10 mL of minimal glycerol yeast nitrogen base (MGY) media using 50 mL centrifuge tubes for small-scale culture.\n\t\nMake three small holes in the centrifuge tube lid for better aeration. Allow cells to grow at 28 °C with constant shaking at 250 rpm until the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) reaches 10, usually taking 1-2 overnights.\n\t\tNOTE: Cell growth usually takes between 12-24 h.\nOn the next day, take 1 L of sterile MGY media and inoculate it with the primary culture in a 2.4 L flask. Incubate the flask at 28 °C in a shaker incubator at 250 rpm for 24 h.\n\t\nTo maintain pH between 5-6, add 10% ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) until the pH stabilizes.\nAdjust the pH and induce protein expression by adding 1 mL of pure methanol per 1 L culture (0.1 % (v/v) methanol).\n\tNOTE: Feed cells subsequently with 5 mL pure methanol per liter culture (0.5 % (v/v) methanol) every 12 h for a total duration of 36-48 h.\nHarvest cells by centrifuging at 15,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C.",
    "Collect cell pellets and resuspend them in lysis buffer (0.33 M sucrose, 0.3 M Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 0.1 M aminohexanoic acid, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM EGTA) to a concentration of 0.5 g/mL. Store the suspension at -80 °C. Typically, one can recover 30 ± 5 g of cell mass from 1 L of cultured cells.\n\t​NOTE: Store cell pellets directly in the freezer or perform immediate resuspension in lysis buffer for membrane preparations.\n2. Preparation of microsomal membrane\nThaw the cells and add protease inhibitors (2 µg/mL leupeptin, 2 µg/mL pepstatin A, 2 mM PMSF, see Table of Materials).\n\t\nTo further lyse cells, use an ice-chilled emulsifier or microfluidizer (see Table of Materials) at 25,000-30,000 psi. Repeat this process 3-4 times.\nCentrifuge to remove cell debris: spin at 3,500-4,000 x g for 15 min, followed by a second spin at 15,000 x g for 30 min. Maintain both spins at 4 °C.\nTo isolate microsomal membrane vesicles, transfer the supernatant to ultracentrifuge tubes and subject it to ultracentrifugation at 2,00,000 x g for 1.5 h at 4 °C.\n\t\nResuspend the membrane pellet in 50 mL of Buffer A (50 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 10% glycerol) using a dounce homogenizer. Store the suspension at -80 °C.\n3. Protein preparation-purification of heterodimers\nThaw the frozen microsomal membranes, and adjust the concentration to 4-6 mg/mL using solubilization buffer. The buffer should contain 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% (w/v) β-dodecyl maltoside (β-DDM), 0.5% (w/v) cholate, 0.1 % (w/v) cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS), 5 mM imidazole, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME), 2 µg/mL leupeptin, 2 µg/mL pepstatin A, and 2 mM PMSF (see Table of Materials).",
    "NOTE: One can mix equal volumes of the membrane preparation and the solubilization buffer, or use 2x solubilization buffer without protease inhibitors and reducing agents. Short boiling of the buffer helps dissolve CHS efficiently. For purification, use only the 4 °C-cooled buffer.\n\t\nStir the mixture at medium speed for 1 h at 4 °C. Follow this with additional stirring at room temperature (RT) for 20-30 min.\nCentrifuge the mixture at 1,00,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble membranes. Collect the solubilized supernatant and add 20 mM imidazole and 0.1 mM TCEP.\nPerform affinity column chromatography26: bind the solubilized supernatant to pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA beads (10-15 mL) (see Table of Materials) in Buffer A (step 2.2.1) overnight.\n\tNOTE: Avoid using glycerol in running buffers from this point onward.\n\t\nWash the column twice with 10 column volumes of Buffer B (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 % (w/v) β-DDM, 0.05 % (w/v) cholate, 0.01 % (w/v) CHS, 0.1 mM TCEP) containing 25 mM imidazole.\nWash the column with 10 column volumes of Buffer B containing 50 mM imidazole.\nElute the protein using Buffer C (Buffer B with 200 mM imidazole).\nAdd 1 mM TCEP (see Table of Materials) and 10 mM MgCl2 to the eluted proteins.\nValidate the eluted fractions on an SDS-PAGE gel to confirm the correct protein size26.\n\t\tNOTE: Typical protein yield (1st Ni-NTA): 10-20 mg protein per 6 L culture. Use DDM at 10x or 5x of its critical micelle concentration (CMC), approximately 0.01%. This protocol employs 0.1% DDM.",
    "Dilute the peak fractions from Ni-NTA elution with an equal volume of Buffer D1 (Buffer B with 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2), mix, and load the protein fractions onto a CBP column (3-5 mL) (see Table of Materials) that has been pre-equilibrated with CBP wash Buffer D1.\nPerform sequential washes on the CBP column to exchange detergents using Buffer D1 and D2 (Buffer B with 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1% (w/v) decyl-maltose neopentyl glycol (DMNG), without β-DDM): first, wash with 3 column volumes of D1; second, wash with 3 column volumes of D1:D2 (3:1, v/v); third, wash with 3 column volumes of D1:D2 (1:1, v/v); fourth step, wash with 3 column volumes of D1:D2 (1:3, v/v), followed by 6-10 column volumes of D2.\nElute the protein using CBP wash Buffer D2 with 300 mM NaCl in 1 mL fractions from the CBP column (total 10 mL). Concentrate the eluted fractions to 1-2 mL.\n\t\tNOTE: The typical protein yield (1st CBP) is 5-15 mg protein per 6 L culture. Maltose neopentyl glycol (MNG) detergents enhance purified protein storage at 4 °C. Both DMNG and Lauryl MNG (LMNG) were used, with DMNG yielding better X-ray diffracting crystals. Use DMNG at 10-20x of its critical micelle concentration (CMC), approximately 0.003%. This protocol used 0.1% DMNG. A fraction of the CBP eluate can be further purified by gel-filtration chromatography (step 4.4.) to analyze proteins' ATPase activity or assess mono-dispersity through transmission electron microscopy (TEM).\n4. Protein preparation-pre-crystallization treatment\nCleave the N-linked glycans and CBP tags using endoglycosidase H (Endo H, ~0.2 mg per 10-15 mg purified protein) and HRV-3C protease (~2 mg per 10-15 mg purified protein), respectively (see Table of Materials). Incubate overnight at 4 °C.",
    "During the Endo H and 3C protease incubation, perform reductive alkylation on the pooled proteins. Begin by incubating with 20 mM iodoacetamide (see Table of Materials) overnight at 4 °C. Follow this with a 1 h incubation with an additional 2 mM iodoacetamide on ice.\n\tNOTE: This step further stabilizes protein storage for up to one month at 4 °C.\nEmploy a second CBP column (1-2 mL) to separate the cleaved CBP tag. Use Buffer D2 for this process.\n\tNOTE: The typical protein yield (2nd CBP) is 5-10 mg protein per 6 L culture.\nPurify the CBP tag-free protein using gel filtration chromatography. The buffer should contain 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) DMNG, 0.05 % (w/v) cholate, and 0.01% (w/v) CHS.\n\tNOTE: The typical protein yield (gel-filtration) is 2-8 mg protein per 6 L culture. During this step, the absence of a DDM peak (~65 kD) during gel filtration indicates successful detergent exchange to DMNG.\nModify the pooled protein fractions through reductive methylation: add 20 mM dimethylamine borane (DMAB, see Table of Materials) and 40 mM formaldehyde to the protein. Incubate for 2 h at 4 °C on an oscillatory shaker. Add 10 mM DMAB.\n\t\nRepeat step 4.5, including the addition of 10 mM DMAB, and incubate overnight (12-18 h) at 4 °C.\nHalt the reaction by adding 100 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5.\nLoad the methylated protein onto a 2 mL Ni-NTA column pre-equilibrated with 100 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and 100 mM NaCl.\n\t\nWash the column using 10 column volumes of wash buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, with 0.5 mg/mL DOPC: DOPE (3:1, w/w), 0.1% (w/v) DMNG, 0.05% (w/v) cholate, 0.01% (w/v) CHS).",
    "Elute the relipidated protein using elution buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 200 mM imidazole, 0.5 mg/mL DOPC: DOPE (1:1, w/w), 0.1% (w/v) DMNG, 0.05% (w/v) cholate, 0.01% (w/v) CHS).\n\t\tNOTE: The typical protein yield (2nd Ni-NTA) is 1-5 mg protein per 6 L culture.\nPass the protein eluates through a PD-10 desalting column pre-equilibrated with the buffer used in step 4.4.\nIncubate the desalted and relipidated protein overnight with cholesterol (prepared in isopropanol or ethanol) to a final concentration of ~20 µM.\n\t\nThe next morning, remove the precipitant by ultracentrifugation at 1,50,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Collect the supernatant.\nConcentrate the protein to a final concentration of 30-50 mg/mL using a 100 kDa cutoff centrifugal concentrator.\nRemove the precipitant using a benchtop refrigerated centrifuge at the top speed for 30 min at 4 °C.\nKeep the supernatant on ice at 4 °C and establish crystallization conditions in the bicelles.\n\t\t​NOTE: The concentrated proteins should be used for crystal growth within a week. Do not freeze the proteins.\n5. Protein crystallization in bicelles\nPrepare a 10% bicelle stock solution with DMPC lipids and CHAPSO detergent in a 3:1 (w/w) ratio (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Use CHAPSO at 5x of its critical micelle concentration (CMC), approximately 0.5%. This maintains detergent concentration around its CMC in the protein-bicelle mixture (step 5.2).\n\t\nAdd deionized H2O-dissolved detergent (CHAPSO) to pre-dried lipids (mixture of 5 mol% cholesterol and 95 mol% DMPC).\n\t\tNOTE: Prepare various lipid compositions in chloroform, and dry them in a glass test tube using a nitrogen gas stream at RT. Eliminate residual solvents by placing them in a vacuum chamber overnight, forming a thin lipid layer.\nResuspend lipids and detergent using a water-bath sonicator.",
    "Sonicate the bicelle mixture in ice-chilled water using continuous power until the solution becomes transparent.\n\t\tNOTE: Use hearing protection and ensure a sufficient ice supply to keep the mixture in a liquid phase.\nRemove undissolved components with a 0.2 µm centrifugal filter (see Table of Materials).\n\t\tNOTE: Store the aliquoted bicelle solution at -80 °C.\nCreate a protein/bicelle mixture on ice by gently combining 10% bicelles (step 5.1.4) and proteins (step 4.7.4) in a 1:4 (v/v) ratio, achieving a final protein concentration between 5-10 mg/mL.\nIncubate the protein and bicelle mixture on ice for 30 min.\nSet up crystallization conditions in a hanging drop vapor diffusion format using 48-well plates.\n\t\nMix equal volumes (0.5 or 1 µL) of protein/bicelle mixture and crystallization reservoir solution containing 1.6 M-2.0 M ammonium sulfate, 100 mM MES (pH 6.5), 0%-4% PEG 400, and 1 mM TCEP (see Table of Materials).\n\t\tNOTE: Create a matrix of the reservoir solution prior to each experiment, adjusting ammonium sulfate (1.6-2.0 M) and PEG 400 (0%-4%).\nIncubate for crystallization at 20 °C.\nCheck the crystallization trays the next day to ensure proper cover glass sealing.\nMonitor crystal growth at least once daily. High-quality crystals usually appear within 1-2 weeks, measuring 50-150 µm x 20-50 µm x 2-5 µm.\n\t\tNOTE: Crystals may take longer to form at lower protein concentrations. Mature crystals should be harvested within one month.\nSoak protein crystals in 0.2 M sodium malonate and flash freeze them in liquid nitrogen using 50 or 100 µm cryo-loops.",
    "NOTE: If an X-ray diffractometer is available, test a few crystals with a 15-30 min X-ray beam exposure to reveal diffraction up to 5 Å. Higher-resolution diffraction requires a synchrotron light source. Using 0.2 M sodium malonate as a cryo-protectant, a crystal measuring 100 µm x 50 µm x 2 µm can provide around 90 diffraction image frames with synchrotron X-ray."
