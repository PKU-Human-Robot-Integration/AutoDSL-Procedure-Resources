    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIsolation of primary porcine RPE\nTiming: 8–10 h\nThis protocol provides effective preparation, harvesting, and purification steps for the isolation and culture of primary porcine RPE on transwell membranes. All steps should be carried out in a biosafety cabinet. Dissection tools should be autoclaved before use and should be routinely disinfected throughout the protocol using 70% ethanol to minimize the risk of contaminating the freshly isolated RPE.\nPrepare eyes for dissection.\nUsing scissors, carefully remove excess tissue surrounding the eye globe and trim the optic nerve back to the sclera without puncturing eye globe. (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2071-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Dissection and preparation of eye cups for RPE isolation\nAfter extraocular tissue is removed from eye (A) and eye is disinfected with PVP prep solution (B), a scalpel is used to make an incision in the eye (C). Clean scissors are used to cut around scleral-corneal interface and anterior chamber (D), vitreous (E), and retina (F) is be removed. Eye cup is then placed in a 6-well plate and filled with L-15 medium (20°C–25°C) (G and H).\nThoroughly disinfect outside of eye with PVP solution. Place globe in a Petri dish. (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nRepeat steps 1a – 1b with desired number of eyes.\nNote: We recommend working through steps 1–3 in groups of 6 while leaving the remaining eyes on ice to maintain tissue integrity. Following removal of the extra-ocular tissues and optic nerves from the first batch of 6 eyes, proceed to step 2.\nWorking in batches of six globes, remove anterior chamber (cornea and iris), lens, vitreous humor, and retina.\nCarefully pierce the globe approximately 0.5 cm posterior to the limbus using a #10 blade scalpel (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).",
    "Using sharp scissors carefully cut around the circumference of the globe, maintaining 0.5 cm distance from limbus.\nRemove the anterior chamber. (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nFrom the remaining posterior chamber, carefully remove and discard the vitreous humor, using curved tip forceps (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nNote: If the vitreous does not easily separate use sharp scissors to carefully cut around the opening in the globe to separate the vitreous body and anterior hyaloid membrane from the eye cup. Following this step, the vitreous should be easily dislodged using forceps. Any remaining vitreous will detach with the removal of the neural retina in step 2e.\nUsing curved tip forceps remove the neural retina, being careful not to disrupt the RPE below. (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nStarting near the optic nerve head gently puncture the neural retina.\nSlide the tips of the forceps underneath the retina and slowly lift the retina away from the underlying RPE.\nThe retina will detach from the RPE and can be gently peeled away with minimal damage to the RPE below.\nNote: Due to the heavy pigmentation of the RPE, the neural retina is sometimes difficult to visualize; however, the retinal vasculature and optic nerve head can usually be clearly seen and can be helpful in locating and removing the neural retina.\nPrepare to harvest RPE.\nOnce RPE is exposed, place each globe into a well of a sterile 6-well plate.\nFill each eye cup with L-15 media (20°C–25°C, 4–5 mL per globe; Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).\nPlace the 6-well plate containing globes filled with L-15 media (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H) into an incubator (37°C, 5% CO2).\nRepeat steps a-c for remaining eyes (nine 6-well plates in total).\nHarvest and purify RPE.",
    "After all eyes have been prepared for RPE harvesting (steps 1–3), prepare fresh 0.25% trypsin in L-15 media (20°C–25°C) and sterilize using a 0.22 μm bottle top filter.\nNote: We recommend making 8 ml of trypsinization media per eye (400 ml for 50 eyes).\nFirst Trypsinization Step.\nWorking with one 6-well plate at a time in a biosafety cabinet, remove L-15 media from eye cups with a pipette and replace with 0.25% trypsin in L-15 media (about 4 mL per eye).\nNote: In this step, aspiration of the L-15 media will help to remove any remaining retinal tissue. (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2071-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Retinal fragments in eye cup\nAny retinal fragments left in eye cup (white arrows) should be removed using a pipette prior to first trypsinization step.\nAfter filling each globe with trypsinization media, replace the 6-well plate into the incubator (37°C, 5% CO2) and repeat steps 4b with the remaining 6-well plates.\nIncubate each plate for 45 min (37°C, 5% CO2).\nFollowing the 45-min incubation period, retrieve each 6-well plate and place in a biosafety cabinet working one six-well plate at a time.\nUse a P1000 pipette to gently triturate to loosen the RPE cells from the walls of each eye cup. When any loose RPE cells have been dislodged, transfer the trypsinization media from each globe into a 50 mL conical tube (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A–3D and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nNote: The trypsinization media containing RPE cells recovered from all 50 eyes should be pooled together and distributed evenly across four 50 mL conical tubes.\nTo maximize the harvesting efficiency, add 4 mL fresh trypsinization media (0.25% trypsin in L-15 media) to each globe. Return the 6-well plate to incubator.",
    "Note: Do not trypsinize the tissue for longer than necessary. Some eyes may release all RPE in first trypsinization incubation. In this case, skip the second trypsinization step (step 4f) and discard eye cup in biohazardous waste.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2071-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Dissection and preparation of eye cups for RPE isolation\nEye cups are filled with trypsinization media (A) and incubated for 30 min at 37oC. A pipette is used to gently dislodge any loose RPE (B and C) and trypsinization media is collected in 50mL conical tubes (D). Collected media is centrifuged at ∼450×g for 20 min and pellet is collected (E and F).\nSecond Trypsinization Step.\nRepeat steps 4c – 4e with remaining 6-well plates.\nIncubate each plate for an additional 45 min (37°C, 5% CO2). During the incubation step:\nDuring the incubation step, centrifuge recovered media from step 4d (approximately 200 mL) at 400–500×g for 20 min. Resuspend all 4 pellets in 2 mL total of fresh L-15 media and set aside at 20°C–25°C. (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E and 3F).\nPlace Primary RPE Culture Medium in 37°C water bath to warm.\nFollowing the 45-min incubation period, retrieve each 6-well plate and place in a biosafety cabinet working one six-well plate at a time.\nUse a P1000 pipette to gently pipette the trypsinization media up and down to loosen the remaining RPE cells from the walls of each eye cup. Retrieve media from eye cup and collect in a 50 mL conical tube. (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A–3D, 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nOnce the trypsinization media has been removed and RPE has been retrieved from the eye cup, discard eye cups and 6-well plate into biohazardous waste.\nRepeat steps 4g – 4i with remaining 6 well plates.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2071-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. RPE in eye cup before and after first and second trypsinization steps",
    "Before trypsinization steps, RPE coverage is uniform (A). Some damage to RPE may occur with with removal of the retinal (black arrow). RPE will begin to lift after first trypsinization step, however large regions of RPE may remain (B). After second trypsinization step, most RPE should be harvested, with small regions of RPE remaining (white arrows) (C).\nCentrifuge recovered media (approximately 200 mL) at 400–500×g for 20 min. While centrifuging:\nPrepare 1 mL of DNaseI Stock Solution in L-15 media in a 15-mL conical tube or Eppendorf tube. Sterile filter (0.22 μm) and set aside at 20°C–25°C for use in step 4n.\nIn two 50 mL conical tubes, prepare two 30 mL 40% Percoll cushions (prepared with Percoll Prep Solution listed above in Materials and Equipment tables, pH 7.4).\nResuspend all 4 pellets from Step 4k in 2 mL total of fresh L-15 media and add to recovered RPE from previous centrifugation step (4f-ii) in a 50mL conical tube (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E and 3F).\nDilute RPE suspension to 9 mL total using L-15 media (20°C–25°C).\nAdd 1 mL of DNaseI Stock Solution to RPE suspension. This should yield a working concentration of 1% DNaseI. Mix well by gentle inversion of the tube. Incubate for 2 min at 20°C–25°C.\nDilute RPE suspension to 40 mL using L-15 media (20°C–25°C).\nCarefully layer 20 mL of RPE suspension on top of each of the 30 mL Percoll cushions. (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nCentrifuge at 500×g for 3 min. After centrifugation, the Percoll cushion should be disrupted and a pellet of pigmented cells should be visible (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2071-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Centrifugation of isolated RPE on Percoll cushion\nIsolated RPE is layered on a cushion of 40% Percoll (A) and centrifuged for 3 min at 500×g. After centrifugation, pellet is recovered (B).\nPlate RPE on transwell inserts.",
    "Pour off Percoll and resuspend pellets at a density of 100,000 cells per mL in prewarmed Primary RPE Culture Medium (step 4f). Plate into the upper chamber of a transwell insert at the following densities and volumes:\nFor 24-well plates add 0.25 mL of resuspended cells to the upper chamber of each well. Add 0.8 mL of prewarmed Primary RPE Culture Medium to lower chamber.\nFor 12-well plates add 0.5 mL of resuspended cells to the upper chamber of each well. Add 1 mL of prewarmed Primary RPE Culture Medium to lower chamber.\nFor 6-well plates add 1.5 mL of resuspended cells to the upper chamber of each well. Add 2 mL of prewarmed Primary RPE Culture Medium to lower chamber.\nPlace freshly plated RPE in incubator (37°C, 5% CO2).\nCarefully change 100% of media in top and bottom wells 36–48 h after isolation in a biosafety cabinet, using fresh, prewarmed Primary RPE Culture Medium. For this media change, use the same media volumes as in Step 5a.\nCritical: Do not move fresh plates until this time, except to place them in the biosafety cabinet. Moving them before their first media change can cause cells to gather in center of the well and disrupts even distribution.\nAfter first change, primary RPE can be maintained for up to 8 months with complete media changes every 3–5 days. (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nNote: Newly isolated RPE may take several days to anchor on membrane and spread out (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]). For this reason, media should be changed with care for first 10 days to prevent loss of cells.",
    "Note: Signs of unsuccessful RPE isolation should present within one month of isolation. RPE cells should be monitored for loss of typical RPE morphology, cell layering, and vessel formation during this time (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8], troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nNote: Some loss of pigmentation may occur over extended periods of culture, but this does not negative affect cell viability.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2071-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Isolated primary porcine RPE\nThe primary RPE shown was isolated using the above protocol and was imaged at 1 week (A) and 1 month (B) post isolation. After 1 week (approximately 2 feedings), cell shedding should cease and surviving RPE should be well anchored to the membrane. These can be maintained indefinitely with regular feeding. Scale bars approximately 50um.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2071-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Isolated primary porcine RPE. Isolated primary RPE take several days to anchor to the membrane and recover organization\nAfter the first feeding, 36–48 h post isolation, cells are tightly contracted (A and B). At 1 week post isolation, cells have begun to release and anchor to membrane (C and D) with cell organization largely recovered 2 weeks after isolation (E and F). Scale bars approximately 50um.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2071-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Loss of typical RPE morphology and vessel formation in unsuccessful RPE isolation\nUnsuccessful RPE isolation will typically present in the first month as a loss of typical RPE morphology. Most notably, RPE cultures may demonstrate a lengthening of RPE cells (A, white arrows) and vessel formation (B, red arrow). If this occurs refer to troubleshooting Problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]. Scale bars approximately 50um.\nCryosectioing of transwell inserts\nTiming: 2 days\nThis step describes a technique that reliably yields satisfactory histological sections from transwell membranes.\nFix and cryoprotect cells on transwell membrane.",
    "Remove cell culture media and gently wash upper and lower chambers of the transwell membrane with PBS to remove excess cell culture media. Apply and remove PBS gently using the walls of the transwell, being careful not to dislodge any cells from the membrane.\nFix cells on the transwell membrane for 30 min at 20°C–25°C by adding 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) to both the upper and lower chambers.\nRemove the PFA and wash twice with PBS (20°C–25°C).\nUsing a #10 blade scalpel, gently cut the transwell membrane from the well around the edge to remove the membrane from the plastic.\nUsing curved tip forceps and a small pair of scissors, cut membrane in half to provide a flat edge for cryosectioning (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2071-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. Embedding of membrane and mounting of block\nOnce fixed, removed from transwell support, and cryoprotected, the membrane should be embedded in OCT in an appropriate size mold. It may be helpful to mark the location of the membrane, shown as black marks on mold. Note: The membrane has been outlined for easier visibility (A). The OCT block should be mounted into cryostat so membrane is perpendicular to the blade (black arrow) with excess OCT both above and below membrane (red arrows) (B and C).\nCryoprotect tissue using a series of sucrose solutions, switching the membrane between wells containing each sucrose solution.\n10% sucrose: 30 min at 20°C–25°C.\n20% sucrose: 30 min at 20°C–25°C.\n30% sucrose: Overnight at 4°C.\nEmbed membrane and prepare block.\nEmbed membrane in Optimal Cutting Temperature (OCT) media in an appropriately sized embedding mold and allow to freeze on dry ice. (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]A).\nPlace a layer of OCT into empty mold, minimizing bubbles.",
    "Place transwell membrane cell side down onto OCT layer, taking care to align the flat edge of membrane with edge of mold.\nApply more OCT on top of membrane so that the membrane is located in the middle of the block when frozen.\nIt may be helpful to mark the location of the membrane on the mold (shown in black marks in Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]A).\nFollowing freezing, remove the embedded membrane from mold and mount into cryostat so the membrane is orientated vertically and perpendicular to blade. (Figures 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]B and 9C).\nHanging cryosection of membrane (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2071-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10. Stepwise images of hanging cryosection technique\nAt a thickness of 5–10 μm, slowly begin sectioning through block.\nUsing a very fine tipped paintbrush, pull down section while slowly continuing to move block down on the blade. (Figures 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]A and 10B).\nStop the section after the blade has traversed the membrane, but before the edge of the OCT block (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]C, troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nReverse the direction of the block, removing the block from the blade and using the paintbrush press the section back onto the block surface (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]D).\nRetrieve section by gently pressing Superfrost Plus Microscope Slide directly to section on block (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]E, troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).\nAfter section is retrieved, finish advancing the blade through the block before starting a new section.\nRepeat through block as necessary.\nNote: This cryosectioning technique should be performed without the use of an anti-roll cover glass. The cover glass will cause the separation of the membrane from the OCT block and will result in loss of orientation of the membrane.\nPerform immunofluorescence, histochemistry, or end point histology as needed, using standard protocols.\nRecommended antibody concentrations for tested antibodies can be found in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] with staining results in Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2071_6.csv"
