  "procedures": [
    "A CRISPR-Cas9-mediated HDR strategy to endogenously tag a POI with BioID-enzymes A detailed protocol for the generation of CRISPR components and screening strategies in Drosophila can be found in Housden et al. (2014).Guide RNA design and cloningSelect one or two suitable CRISPR target sites using the flyCRISPR Target Finder tool (http://targetfinder.flycrispr.neuro.brown.edu/[href=http://targetfinder.flycrispr.neuro.brown.edu/]) (Gratz et al., 2014). The target site should ideally be located in close proximity (≤100 bp) to the intended hinge region between the endogenous coding DNA sequence (CDS) of the POI and the BioID-encoding insert. Guide sequences with estimated off-targets (annotated in the flyCRISPR Target Finder tool) should be avoided. We followed the flyCRISPR protocol for cloning guide plasmids (available at https://flycrispr.org/protocols/grna/[href=https://flycrispr.org/protocols/grna/]).Note: If not possible otherwise, one off-target sequence on a different chromosome can be tolerated since the affected chromosome can be removed later during the screening process. A CRISPR off-target site might nonetheless decrease the number of positive candidates obtained. dsDNA donor design and cloningSmall, commonly used bacterial plasmids (e.g., puc57, pBlueScript II, or pCRII Topo) can be efficiently employed as vector backbone. Gene-specific homology arms (from 0.5-1kb length; longer and shorter sequences can also be chosen but might affect HDR efficiency) are cloned from a genomic DNA source by standard procedures. Codon-optimized CDS of BioID-enzymes should be used for optimal codon usage in the targeted species. Plasmids for expression of next-generation BioID enzymes, miniTurbo (number 116905), and TurboID (number 116904) can be obtained from Addgene and used as template for amplification. Short and flexible amino acid linker sequences such as 1-4x[Glycine-Glycine-Serine-Glycine] or 1-4x[Glycine-Serine-Alanine-Threonine] between the POI and the BioID enzyme can be introduced to minimize potential effects on POI function caused by steric hindrance (http://parts.igem.org/Protein_domains/Linker[href=http://parts.igem.org/Protein_domains/Linker], available @ igem.org, 22 April 2022). However, it should be considered that linker sequences likely increase the BioID labeling radius.",
    "Small protein tags, e.g., HA (amino acid sequence Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Val-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Ala) or OLLAS: Ser-Gly-Phe-Ala-Asn-Glu-Leu-Gly-Pro-Arg-Leu-Met-Gly-Lys) can also be added to analyze expression and localization of the chimeric protein. Several strategies can be used to mask the CRISPR target site for Cas9 recognition in the donor vector: (1) changing Guanine(s) within the NGG PAM sequence, thereby introducing a silent mutation in the POI’s CDS; (2) if changing the NGG sequence is not feasible, several nucleotides in the target sequence can be altered, introducing silent point mutations in the POI’s CDS; (3) placing the CRISPR target site over the intended hinge region so that the recognized sequence will be split and separated by the BioID-encoding insert. The last approach is recommended if the NGG PAM following the target sequence is located in a non-protein-coding region where base-pair alterations could affect gene expression.Notes:  Sequence information of the miniTurbo and TurboID next generation BioID enzymes (Branon et al., 2018) can be obtained from plasmids deposited at Addgene #116905 and #116904, respectively. These can be employed as templates for amplification. Scarless gene editing provides a donor vector system that simplifies the candidate screening process (https://flycrispr.org/scarless-gene-editing/[href=https://flycrispr.org/scarless-gene-editing/]).AviTagTM (Schatz, 1993; Cognet et al., 2005) can be used to incorporate artificial biotinylation sites in the POI or possible proximitome candidates. In case of no or few accessible lysine residues, this can serve as a BioID positive control (adding AviTag to the POI) or to enable detection of a proximitome candidate by MS. Plasmid injection into Drosophila embryosInjection of guide RNA and dsDNA donor plasmids in Drosophila embryos that express Cas9 in their germ line can either be done by following flyCRISPR injection protocols (https://flycrispr.org/protocols/injection/[href=https://flycrispr.org/protocols/injection/]) or using a Drosophila microinjection facility or commercial injection service.Note: Several transgenic Drosophila stocks expressing Cas9 in their germ line (e.g., M{vas-Cas9}ZH-2A) are available for injection.",
    "It should be taken into account that the genetic background of the injection stock should a) be identical to the genetic background that was used to select the CRISPR/Cas9 guide RNA target sites, and b) not distort the following experimental analysis (certain traits, e.g., sleep and life span are highly impacted by genetic background). Furthermore, the source of the Cas9-transgene should be located on a different chromosome than the targeting region. Screening for CRISPR-mediated HDR eventsParental (P) male flies derived from the injected embryos are crossed individually to female virgin flies from a suitable balancer stock. P female flies are crossed “en masse” to suitable balancer males. After 2–3 days, egg-laying females can be identified and isolated in fresh culture vials. Isolation of fertile females can be continued on every other day. Excluding non-fertile females at this point significantly reduces consumables and work spent during the screening process. Two to five F1 males from each parental cross are isolated and crossed individually to balancer females. When larval progeny is visible in the F1 cross, the F1 males can be sacrificed for genomic DNA isolation and further genotyping using single fly PCR screening.Note: We follow a standard single fly DNA preparation protocol (available, e.g., fromhttp://francois.schweisguth.free.fr/protocols/Single_fly_DNA_prep.pdf[href=http://francois.schweisguth.free.fr/protocols/Single_fly_DNA_prep.pdf]) with the following modifications: Proteinase K digestion is done in a PCR-cycler for 30 min at 50°C, followed by enzyme inactivation for 10 min at 85°C. We typically prepare 25 µL PCR mixes with 2.5 µL from the crude DNA preparation as template solution. Positive candidates should be analyzed by Sanger sequencing before further experiments are conducted. In vivo labeling of the POI interactome in Drosophila Place an apple-agar plate with a smear of yeast paste in an embryo collection cage.",
    "Transfer 40–50 young (<7 days) female and male flies expressing the chimeric BioID-POIs to the embryo cages and allow egg laying for 2–8 h. If sufficient eggs are laid, remove plates from the cage and age at 25°C. If not, replace with a new apple-agar plate for another egg laying period.Note: As a background control, use an appropriate reference fly stock that closely matches the genetic background of your genetically engineered flies (e.g., w1118 or Canton-S). After 22–23 h, remove hatched larvae from the plate using a Drosophila sorting brush and check again every hour for freshly hatched first instar L1 larvae. Transfer 50 L1 larvae from the same collection point into a Drosophila culture vial containing a sufficient amount of Bloomington formula (BF) fly food supplemented with 100 µM biotin. For each genotype/condition/replicate, prepare at least five vials.Notes:  Biotin stock is prepared with water and incorporated into fly food after cooking before pouring into the vials to make 100 µM final concentration. Synchronizing developmental timing at this step is important obtain the proximitome from a homogeneous population of age-matched third instar larvae. Higher concentrations of supplemented biotin resulted in lethality of control larvae that did not express any BioID-fusion protein (Uçkun et al., 2021). Collect 150 biotin-fed third instar larvae (72–120 h after egg laying; 48–96 h after hatching) for each genotype/condition/replicate.Protein extraction from Drosophila larval brains Dissect 150 larval brains (Hafer and Schedl, 2006) in ice-cold PBS and transfer to a microcentrifuge tube containing 300–400 µL PBS on ice.Notes:  Dissection is ideally performed by multiple persons to avoid sample decay and de-synchronizing of developmental timing. If the dissection is performed by only one person, several rounds of dissection for one genotype/condition/replicate are required.",
    "Dissected brains can be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until the required sample size is collected. After dissection is complete, remove the PBS and lyse dissected third instar larval brains directly in 700 µL of RIPA buffer supplemented with 1× cOmpleteTM Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail, 1× phosSTOPTM phosphatase inhibitor, and 1 mM DTT using a tissue grinding pestle.Centrifuge samples at 21,500 × g at 4°C for 20 min and transfer supernatant to a new microcentrifuge tube.Perform BCA assays to determine protein concentration for each sample.Notes:  Equal or greater than 1 mg of total protein for each sample/replicate/condition is desirable. BCA assay is performed according to the PierceTM BCA Protein Assay Kit user guide. Normalization of protein quantity is required prior to pull-down if different numbers of brains are lysed, and protein concentration varies between samples. This can be done by diluting more concentrated samples with RIPA buffer. Transfer 50 µL of lysate to a separate microcentrifuge tube for western blot analysis and validation of protein biotinylation; 50 µg protein is sufficient for western blot analysis of biotinylated proteins. Use specific antibodies to detect your POI or an optional protein tag as well as anti-Biotin-HRP/Streptavidin-HRP to confirm increased protein biotinylation. Use antibodies against housekeeping proteins (such as anti α-tubulin) as loading control.Note: Protocols for western blotting of biotinylated proteins with some examples are available in Roux et al. (2013). Pull-down of biotinylated proteins This pull-down protocol is adapted from Roux et al. (2013).Prepare 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes for each sample/replicate and place on a magnetic stand.Note: The following steps are performed at room temperature. Add 500 µL of RIPA buffer and 500 µL of 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.4 to each tube.",
    "Homogenize DynabeadsTM MyOneTM Streptavidin C1 stock solution by gently tapping and add 300 µL to each tube. Place tubes in the magnetic stand and wait 3 min.Note: The quantity of streptavidin beads used will depend on the amount of protein in the sample; 300 µL of beads are sufficient for 1–1.5 mg of total protein. Use more beads for higher protein amounts.
