    "This method was developed through collaborative efforts involving different clinical services (Urology, Pathology, and the La Fe Hospital Biobank). The study was conducted in compliance with institutional, national, and international guidelines for human welfare, and it received approval from the Ethics Committee for Biomedical Research at the Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Hospital Universitario y Politécnico La Fe (Valencia, Spain). All samples were stored at the La Fe Hospital Biobank (PT13/0010/0026). The overall procedure is detailed in Figure 1.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65635/65635fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Overall procedure scheme.

Tumor targeting\nBefore surgery, utilize multiparametric or biparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI or bpMRI)17,18 to locate the tumor and map its position within the prostate gland. Combine the information obtained from MRI with findings from transrectal ultrasound or rectal examination if the latter yields discordant results.\nTo enhance tumor localization, review the results of preoperative ultrasound-guided and MRI-guided transrectal prostate biopsies.\n\t​NOTE: In the diagnostic procedure for prostate cancer, biopsies are taken directly from the prostate via transrectal access. These biopsies include systematic sampling from the prostate (involving cylinders distributed all around the gland) and cylinders directly targeted to suspicious findings on MRI. To target the retrieval of these samples, transrectal ultrasound is used, which is combined with MRI findings in a cognitive manner (\"cognitive fusion\") or with \"real MRI-ultrasound fusion software\" when available.\n2. Radical prostatectomy and prostate collection\nPerform a standardized robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy through a transperitoneal approach, following the steps outlined by Huynh et al.19.\n\t\nStart with abdominal access, insufflation, and camera port placement (see Table of Materials). Place the remaining five ports under direct vision. Set pneumoperitoneum to 12 mm.",
    "Release the bladder by incising the peritoneum and dissect the perirectal space.\nOpen the pelvic fascia on each side.\nPerform a complete dissection of the anterior and lateral aspects of the prostate and bladder.\nCarry out the opening of the bladder neck, identify and section the proximal urethra to gain access to the posterior aspects of the prostate and bladder.\nDissect the seminal vesicles and rectum space19.\nDissect the lateral aspects of the prostate, sparing the neurovascular bundles.\nEnsure hemostasis of vessels in the retropubic space.\nDissect the apex and section the distal urethra.\nComplete the vesicourethral anastomosis.\nExtract the prostate and perform the closure of the incision19.\nCollect the fresh prostate in a dry container. It is crucial not to fix or paraffin-embed the sample specimen.\nTransport the fresh surgical specimen, which includes the entire prostate, to the Biobank for sample processing.\n3. Prostate processing and sample collection\nSelect targeted prostate zones for sampling based on tumor location information retrieved from preoperative mpMRI, preoperative biopsy results, and direct prostatectomy specimen palpation. Record this information on a form that includes patient identification data, prostate areas finally sampled, and the number of samples collected.\n\tNOTE: When MRI findings, preoperative biopsy results, and direct prostatectomy specimen palpation are concordant, target all the samples to that or those locations (between 4 and 6 cylinders). If there is any discordance, increase the number of cylinders and separately target all zones that are suspicious of being affected by any of those methods.\nUse a disposable automatic needle (surgeon) to retrieve cylindrical samples from the selected areas (step 1.1). Then, identify (pathologist) the outer zone of the cylinder, clamp the cylinder with tissue forceps, place it on a slide, and mark the outer zone with tissue ink. Repeat this process with all cylinders taken.",
    "Place the collected cylinders horizontally on a sample holder disk (see Table of Materials) filled with cryostat embedding medium and transfer them to the microtome cooling platen for cutting.\nOnce placed on the platen, attach the sample holder disk to the specimen chuck, and cut it with careful movements of the wheel following the next steps:\n\t\nUse the optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT compound, see Table of Materials) to embed the tissue sample before frozen sectioning on a microtome-cryostat.\nAfterward, cut the sample using a cryostat-microtome at -25 °C. Collect thin cylinder-shaped sections of tissue (10 µm) onto treated microscope slides. Ensure to collect only a few microns of tissue to ensure an adequate amount of intact tumor tissue for storage in the Biobank.\nGather two or three thin sections per slide and manually stain them to control the final coloration. The technician's eye ensures optimal staining, and any necessary re-staining can be done. Follow these steps\n\t\t\nFix slides in 96% ethanol, hydrate in distilled water, and stain with Harris hematoxylin (see Table of Materials) for 1 min to stain the nuclei. Remove excess hematoxylin by rinsing the slides with distilled water.\nTreat slides with 30% ammonium hydroxide to turn the hematoxylin blue. Remove excess solution with rinses of distilled water.\nStain slides with eosin (see Table of Materials) for 30 s.\nNext, dehydrate the slides with increasing titrations of alcohol, clear with xylene (100%), and mount them with DPX (a mixture of distyrene, a plasticizer, and xylene, used as a synthetic resin mounting media that replaces xylene-balsam, see Table of Materials). During these steps, dip the slides into and remove them from the jar of Coplin solution.",
    "Finally, place a coverslip on top of the stained tissue and use a medium with a suitable refractive index (see Table of Materials) for viewing under a microscope.\n4. Sample characterization\nAnalyze the sample under a light microscope (pathologist), discriminating the areas of carcinoma and determining the Gleason score of the tumor. Document all these data and mark the precise tumor zones on the slides.\nDuring this step, label the slide with the precise location of the tumor and its respective Gleason Score20. Also, mark the location of PIN (Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasm) based on morphological identification.\n5. Sample micro-macro-dissection and storage\nClearly mark different histological components with distinct markers on the slide (pathologist) and directly correlate them with frozen tissue on the disk.\nThen, using a surgical blade, macro-micro dissect the areas of the sample marked on the slide within the OCT disc, dividing them into tumoral, peri-tumoral, PIN, and normal prostatic tissue.\nAs the embedding medium begins to defrost, handle the tissue with forceps and place it into correctly labeled cryotubes.\n\tNOTE: Carefully store each dissected fragment within the corresponding tube, following the histological diagnosis of the cryo-slices.\nStore the labeled cryotubes with fully characterized histological samples in the Biobank at -80 °C for subsequent use in research studies.\n\tNOTE: The steps described in this section can be performed by a trained technician under the supervision of the pathologist. The surgical specimen should be transported to the Biobank as soon as possible to prevent tissue and nucleic acid degradation. According to the reference guides, efforts must be made to avoid prolonged ischemia time (>30 min)21. The samples can be kept in the Biobank indefinitely as long as the sample quality principles are maintained.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
