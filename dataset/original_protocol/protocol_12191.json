    "All animal experiments and procedures were approved by the Tulane University's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n1. Surgical Procedure Setup\nAutoclave instruments, surgical supplies, and culture supplies prior to surgery. Surgical supplies for each rat include: 1 drape, 1 drape with pre-cut hole (0.5 in x 1.5 in) in the center, gauze pads, and 1 absorbent underpad. Surgical instruments include: 1 scalpel with a number 10 blade, 2 pairs of tweezers, and a pair of fine scissors. Culture supplies include: 1 drape, 1 pair of tweezers, and prepared 6-well plate inserts with polycarbonate filters.\nSterilize a plexiglass platform, a surgical stage and a surgical benchtop space with 70% ethanol. Keep the surgical stage in a sterile bowl until use.\n\t\nCreate a surgical stage by drilling an approximately 2 in by 1 in hole in the center of a 100 mm culture dish. Next, use sandpaper to smooth any sharp edges and add a layer of silicone glue to the hole's edges to create a raised surface for the tissues.\nAlternatively, design the surgical stage using CAD software and make by 3-D printing (Figure 1).\nPlace a sterile absorbent underpad down and lay a plexiglass platform on top of it. Place the drape, without a pre-cut hole, over a heated pad next to the absorbent underpad.\nPre-warm sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), media and saline to 37 °C. Place media and PBS in separate culture dishes atop the heating pad and place saline in a 50 mL conical tube next to the surgical setup.\nMake sure all packages are opened prior to the beginning of the surgery to ensure sterile handling of all materials. A complete list of the common tools used in this procedure are listed in the Table of Specific Surgical Materials and Tools.\n2. Mesentery Tissue Harvesting",
    "Use adult male Wistar rats (350 ± 25 g; 6 - 8 weeks of age). Other strains and ages of rats can be substituted.\nAnesthetize the rat via an intramuscular injection of ketamine (80 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (8 mg/kg body weight). Confirm the rat is under anesthesia by pinching between the toes to check for a reflex response; there should be none. Pre-emptive analgesia for this terminal procedure is not necessary.\nShave the abdominal region and remove remaining hair using hair removal cream. Wipe abdominal skin twice with 70% isopropyl alcohol followed by povidone-iodine. For the wipes the surgeon should start at the center of the surgical site and move to the outside of the prepared area in a circular manner as to not overlap areas that have been previously scrubbed with the same piece of sterile gauze or sterile cotton swab. Then transfer animal to the sterile surgical setup and place atop the plexiglass platform.\nUsing a scalpel blade, make a 0.75 in - 1.25 in incision in the gut starting 1 in below the sternum. Be careful not to puncture the bowel or mesentery (1 layer of skin, 1 layer of connective tissue, and 1 layer of muscle).\nPlace a drape with a pre-cut hole over the incision and place a sterile surgical stage atop the drape. Ensure the opening aligns with the incision. Use sterile cotton-tipped applicators to locate and pull out the ileum through the surgical stage opening.\nPull 6 - 8 mesenteric windows through the stage using cotton-tipped applicators, and be careful not to touch the windows (Figure 1). Tissues are typically harvested from the ileum region of the small intestine starting near the cecum. Keep exposed tissues moist with warmed sterile saline as needed using a sterile syringe to drip the solution.",
    "Euthanize the rat via intracardiac injection of pentobarbital sodium (0.2 mL per rat). Before removing mesenteric windows, ensure the rat is euthanized by palpating the heart; there should be no pulse.\nRemove desired mesentery tissues by using tweezers to grab the fat pad and fine scissors to cut the window. Leave a border of fat (2 mm) around the window. Wash tissues once in warmed sterile PBS and once in media.\nReturn exteriorized ileum to the abdominal cavity and dispose of animal according to institutional guidelines.\n3. Mesentery Tissue Culture for Time-Lapse Studies\nTransfer autoclaved culture supplies (see section 1.1) and tissues to a sterile laminar flow hood.\nUse tweezers to transfer each tissue atop a polycarbonate filter membrane. Grab tissues by the fat pad to avoid damaging the vasculature.\nQuickly spread the tissue using the fat pad, being careful not to touch the window. Invert the insert with the tissue into the bottom of a 6-well plate and cover with 3 mL of media (Figure 1). Typical media used for this procedure includes Minimum Essential Media (MEM) with 1% Penicillin Streptomycin (PenStrep) and 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS). Media can be supplemented with other serums and/or growth factors to stimulate angiogenesis.\nRepeat steps 3.2 - 3.3 for each tissue and culture in standard incubator conditions (5% CO2, 37 °C) for up to 5 days.\n4. Time-Lapse Imaging of Mesentery Tissue\nOn the day of imaging, supplement the media in each well with conjugated BSI-Lectin and incubate under standard culture conditions for 30 min. Wash tissues twice with lectin-free media. BSI-Lectin stain will remain visible on the mesentery tissue for up to 3 days in culture.\nTransfer the plate to a microscope stage. Identify blood and lymphatic vessels based on their morphology and network structure.",
    "Locate a desired network region on each tissue and take images. Take note of the imaging location to ensure the same region will be captured for subsequent images. If using a motorized stage, document the coordinates.\nReturn tissues to the incubator and continue to culture until desired end point. Repeat steps 4.1 - 4.3 as needed depending on desired experimental time points.\n5. Tissue Immunolabeling\nBSI-Lectin Labeling\nIncubate tissues for 30 min at 37 °C with 1:40 FITC-conjugated lectin in media (2.5 mL antibody solution per well in 6-well plate) followed by two rinses with media. For rinses, add media and then immediately replace.\nLive/Dead Labeling\nIncubate tissues for 10 min at 37 °C with 1:500 2 mM ethidium homodimer-1 and 1:500 1 mM calcein AM in media (2.5 mL antibody solution per well in 6-well plate) followed by two rinses with media.\nBSI-Lectin/NG2 Labeling\nSpread tissues on a microscope slide (1 - 2 tissues/slide) and allow to dry. Remove excess fat with a scalpel by pressing down firmly to excise the fat.\nFix tissues in cold methanol for 30 min at -20 °C. Wash tissues with PBS (3 x 10 min).\nFor primary antibody labeling incubate tissues for 1 h at room temperature with 1:100 rabbit polyclonal NG2 antibody and 5% normal goat serum (NGS).
