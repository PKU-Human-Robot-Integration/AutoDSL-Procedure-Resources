Culture the cells in 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator.\nChange the medium of HEK293T cells with 2 mL fresh DMEM-10% FBS before transfection.\nCo-transfect lentiviral vector (PCDH-CMV-luciferase-EF1α-BSD), packing vector (psPAX2) and envelope vector (pMD2.G) into HEK293T cells using LipoFiter™ Liposomal Transfection Reagent (Mass ratio of 3 vectors is 4:3:3).\nNote: For the details of lipofection procedure, read the protocols provided by commercial Liposomal Transfection Reagent.\nChange the medium with 2 mL DMEM-10% FBS in 6–12 h to remove the liposomes and residual plasmids.\n48 h from lipofection, collect the culture medium (lentivirus supernatant) and supplement with the same volume of fresh DMEM-10% FBS, which will be collected in another 24 h.\nFilter the lentivirus supernatant with 0.45 μm millipore filter membrane and collect the lentivirus in a 15 mL centrifugal tube (polypropylene resin).\nNote: Lentivirus supernatant can be stored at 4°C for no more than one week and at −80°C for no more than one year.\nLentivirus infection of HCT116 cells.\nMix lentivirus supernatant and DMEM-10% FBS (vol/vol = 1:1) in a 35 mm dish, and passage 0.5 × 106 HCT116 cells. Culture the cells in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator.\nOptional: Add 6–8 μg/mL polybrene to promote efficiency of infection.\nChange the medium of HCT116 cells with 2 mL fresh DMEM-10% FBS in 12–24 h.\nCulture the cells for 2–3 days, and then add 3–10 μg/mL blasticidin S to screen the resistant cells. Wild-type HCT116 cells can be used as a control.",
    "Note: Remove the medium with blasticidin S when the wild-type cells are all killed. The virus concentration and infection time are adjustable based on the cell type to be infected. The infection time can vary from 12 h to 24 h, and the ratio of virus/DMEM-10%FBS can vary from 1:9 to 1:1.\nCritical: Make sure the cells are in good state (Cell survival, growth, morphology, etc).\nDetect luciferase expression in infected HCT116 cells.\nCollect 1 × 106 HCT116 cells stably expressing luciferase (HCT116-luc) in a 1.5 mL centrifugal tube. Centrifuge cell suspension at 1,000 × g for 2 min. Remove the supernatant.\nAdd 100 μL 7.5 mg/mL D-luciferin into the 1.5 mL centrifugal tube.\nBioluminescence imaging of the cells immediately by Tanon-5200 Chemiluminescent Imaging System with 10 s exposure time (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2347-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Bioluminescence imaging of HCT116-luc cells\n(A and B) 1 × 106 HCT116-luc cells were collected in a 1.5 mL centrifugal tube and 100 μL D-luciferin were added into the tube. Brightfield imaging (A) and bioluminescence imaging (B) of the cells were performed.\nEstablishment of cell-derived xenografts in BALB/c nude mice\nTiming: 2 weeks\nThe aim of this session is to gain transplantable tumor tissues. HCT116-luc cells are inoculated subcutaneously into BALB/c nude mice. The xenografts can be used as transplantable tumor tissues. All animal experiments strictly complied with ethics and relevant regulations.\nPreparation of cells for the inoculation.\nChange the medium of HCT116-luc cells in a 100 mm dish of 70% influence with fresh DMEM-10% FBS the day before inoculation.\nCritical: The cells must be in the exponential growth stage.\nDigest the cells with 0.05% trypsin and wash cells twice with PBS.\nCount the cells with an automated cell counter (Invitrogen Countess).",
    "Centrifuge cell suspension at 1,000 × g for 2 min, remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in the mixture of serum-free DMEM and matrigel (vol/vol = 1:1) at a density of 2 × 107 cells/mL.\nNote: Put the cell suspension (step 4-e) on ice, and mix the cell suspension intensively with a pipette before inoculation.\nSubcutaneous inoculation.\nNote: 6 weeks-old, 18–20 g weight BALB/c nude mice will be used.\nAnesthetize one mouse in an induction chamber, filled with 2% isoflurane.\nAspirate 100 μL cell suspension (step 4-e) with a 1 mL syringe with 27G 0.5-inch needle.\nDisinfect the mouse dorsal skin with 75% ethanol.\nInsert the needle into the skin at disinfected area to reach the subcutaneous pocket.\nNote: Avoid inserting the needle into muscle layer or thorax.\nGently inject the cell suspension into the subcutaneous pocket.\nAfter injection, hold for a few seconds before pulling out the needle gently and vertically.\nPlace the mouse back into the cage and monitor until it is awake and mobile.\nFeed the mice under stable raising conditions for two weeks.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2347-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Establishment of subcutaneous xenografts with HCT116-luc cells in BALB/c nude mice\nHCT116-luc cells were subcutaneously implanted into BALB/c nude mice. The subcutaneous xenograft was indicated with red arrow.\nNote: Monitor the mice 2–3 times a week. The tumor lump can be observed in 7–10 days after inoculation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nCollection and processing of transplantable tumor tissues\nTiming: 20–30 min\nIn this session, the xenografts established in the previous procedure were excised and minced into small pieces. These pieces will be used in orthotopic implantation procedure.\nEuthanize the mice with xenografts.\nRemove the xenografts from sacrificed nude mice.\nUsing the fine-iris scissors, open the skin near the xenograft.\nUsing the fine-tissue forceps, gently separate the xenograft from adjacent tissues.",
    "Place the xenograft into a 100 mm dish with serum-free DMEM (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2347-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Preparation of transplantable tumor tissues\n(A and B) The subcutaneous xenograft was dissected from BALB/c nude mice (A) and cut into 1–2 mm3 pieces. The shredded tumor tissues were indicated with white arrows (B).\nUsing a sterile scalpel blade, mince the xenograft into 1–2 mm3 pieces (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nCritical: The small pieces should be immersed in serum-free DMEM to retain viability until orthotopic implantation.\nCritical: Surgical instruments must be strictly sterilized.\nOrthotopic transplantation of colorectal tumor tissues\nTiming: 8 weeks\nIn this session, the small pieces of tumor tissues were used to orthotopically implant into another group of 6 weeks-old female BALB/c nude mice (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). The implantation was performed as described previously.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2347-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Orthotopic transplantation procedures of intestinal tumor tissues\n(A) Schematic diagram of orthotopic transplantation of intestinal tumor tissues.\n(B) An incision was made on the skin.\n(C) The cecum was exteriorized.\n(D) A pouch was created under the serosa. The red arrow indicates the epithelial pocket.\n(E) A piece of graft was pushed into the pouch.\n(F) The orthotopic implantation area was covered with surgical tissue adhesive.\n(G) The cecum was put back into the abdomen.\n(H) The abdominal wall was sutured.\n(I and J) The skin was sutured.\nCritical: It is the most essential procedure.\nPreparation for the surgery.\nSterilize surgical instruments before the surgery.\nAnesthetize one mouse with 4% chloral hydrate (100 μL/10 g body weight) via intraperitoneal injection.\nPlace the mouse onto a heating pad.\nNote: Avoid overheating and monitor the reflexes and breathing of the mouse continuously.\nPosition the mouse on its back and use duct tape to fix its forelegs and hind legs in a V-shape.",
    "Disinfect the abdomen of the mouse with 0.5% iodophor.\nOpen the abdomen of the mouse.\nUsing the curved fine-tissue forceps, hold the skin in abdomen.\nUsing the fine-iris scissors, incise a 15 mm vertical midline on the skin.\nTo isolate the surgical area, place a small sterile surgical gauze (with a rhomboidal incision in the middle) onto the incision of the mouse abdomen (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nIncise the linea alba to separate the rectus abdominis muscles.\nNote: During the incision, avoid damaging the large vessels in the abdominal wall and the abdominal organs.\nCritical: Drench the gauze with sterile PBS, it is essential to keep the surgical area hydrated.\nDrape out the cecum at the upper left side of the abdomen with a sterile cotton swab drenched in sterile PBS.\nNote: Do not use metal surgical tools to hold the intestine. Make sure to avoid damaging the abdominal organs.\nPlace the cecum horizontally onto the gauze (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nCritical: During the extra-abdominal surgery, it is essential to keep intestine hydrated with sterile PBS continuously.\nUsing the fine-tissue forceps, gently hold and lift the serosa layer of the cecum.\nUsing the fine-spring scissors, make a 3–4 mm vertical incision on the serosa layer.\nNote: The incision should be made between the large blood vessels to prevent unintentional bleeding.\nCritical: It is essential to incise the external layer of the intestinal epithelium but not the entire intestinal wall. Perforating the entire intestinal wall is lethal for the mouse.\nCritical: To prevent rupture of the serosa, keep the intestinal epithelium hydrated with sterile PBS.\nUsing two pairs of fine-tissue forceps, remove the muscularis externa to separate the serosa from the underlying submucosa layer on both sides of the opening (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nNote: By performing this operation, a pouch is created.",
    "Note: Make sure to avoid perforating the intestinal wall.\nUsing curved fine-tissue forceps, gently pick up a piece of graft and push it into the pouch (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nCritical: The graft should fit within the pouch.\nCover the orthotopic implantation area with a small amount of surgical tissue adhesive (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F).\nCritical: It is essential to prevent post-operative adhesions between the surgical incision and the abdominal wall.\nUsing another cotton swab drenched in sterile PBS, gently put the cecum back into the abdomen (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]G).\nSuture the abdominal wall (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]H).\nSuture the skin (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]I and 4J).\nPlace the mouse back into the cage, monitor it to be awake and mobile.\nNote: Make sure the mice are in good status and the sutures are not pulled off the day after surgery.\nFeed the mice under stable raising conditions for eight weeks.\nAnalysis of the hepatic metastasis of CRC\nTiming: 20–30 min\nEight weeks after the orthotopic implantation, the metastatic nodules in the livers can be counted and statistically analyzed.\nPerform intraperitoneal injection of 100 μL 7.5 mg/mL D-luciferin to the mice.\nEuthanize the mice 10 min after injection.\nRemove the livers from the mice immediately and place the tissues in a clean 100 mm dish. Big metastatic nodules can be easily observed and counted (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2347-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Analysis of hepatic metastasis of CRC\n(A) The mouse with intestinal tumor was euthanized and the liver was dissected.\n(B) Bioluminescence imaging of the dissected liver tissue.\n(C) The luciferase intensity of dissected liver was measured with Tanon Image software.\n(D) The hepatic nodules were validated to be metastatic tumors by HE staining.
