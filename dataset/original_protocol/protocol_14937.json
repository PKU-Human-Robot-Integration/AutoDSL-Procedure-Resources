    "The described protocol includes pre-injury/baseline testing and post-injury follow-up assessment and is completed using three stations. This testing can be completed individually or in groups of four subjects at each station at a time. Subjects proceed through each station in the order listed below. Table 1 illustrates the protocol’s testing administration schedule. Ethics approval for this research was obtained from the Holland Bloorview Research Ethics Board at the Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital. All participants and their legal guardians provide signed informed consent prior to completing the protocol and related data collection.\nPre-injury/Baseline Testing\n1. Station 1: Obtaining Pre-injury Demographic Information, Post-concussion Symptom Report and Resting State Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Data\nPrior to subject(s) arriving for testing, ensure all equipment is functioning properly and ready for testing and that the assessment rooms are free from unnecessary distractions.\nAfter reviewing parental and subject consent, measure and record the subject’s height and weight. Set up heart rate monitor straps and watches on each subject properly.\nAdminister the demographic information form and collect post-concussion symptom report using the Child version of the Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory(PCSI-C) while each subject is seated for 5 min.\nHave each subject lay supine on the ground on a clean sanitized mat. Turn on the heart rate monitors to record resting state heart rate variability (HRV) data (with R-R interval function set to [On]). Have each subject remain lying in supine quietly without talking for 10 min while recording HR.\nAfter 10 min, click the lap button on the watch to indicate the end of supine lying resting state HRV data collection. Ask the subject to return to a seated position, click the lap button on the watch again to indicate beginning of resting state seated HRV data collection.",
    "Have each subject remain in the seated position for 5 min without talking. After 5 min, stop the watch recording function to end the session and resting state HRV data collection. Ask the subject to take off the heart rate strap and watches.\n2. Station 2: Obtaining Cognitive Performance Data\nHave each subject sit at an individual cubicle with a personal laptop set up with a mouse. Ensure testing environment is free from distraction.\nAdminister the Immediate Post-concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT), a rapid and computerized neuropsychological assessment tool (approximately 25 min to complete).\n3. Station 3: Obtaining Static Balance, Grip Strength and Agility/Motor Skills Data\nAdminister the static balance assessment using the modified Clinical Test of Sensory Integration of Balance (m-CTSIB) on the portable balance system. While standing on the balance system forceplate, the subject completes four ordered conditions that include standing with eyes open for 20 sec; standing with eyes closed for 20 sec; standing with eyes open on indexed foam pad for 20 sec; and standing with eyes closed on indexed foam pad for 20 sec.\nUsing a Dynamometer, measure and record hand grip strength in kg for both right and left hands. Record the dominant hand for each subject while still completing 3 consecutive trials for each hand starting with the dominant hand. Out of the 3 trials taken, the maximum hand grip on each hand will also be recorded. For each trial the subject is told to squeeze the grip as hard as they can for 3 sec keeping a neutral upper extremity position (standing upright, straight arm parallel beside the body, palm facing the body and wrist neutral).",
    "In a hallway or gym at least 2.5 m wide and 15 m long administer the agility/motor skills assessment using the ABI-Challenge Assessment (ABI-CA) - Concussion Module. Lay tape on the ground in a straight line marking points for every 1 m. In the following order administer these 6 tests following the guidelines and scoring criteria provided in the concussion module.\n\t\nJumping-jacks (Timed):\n\t\t\nStand with your arms at your sides and jump into an “X” position with arms and legs, and then instantly jump back into starting position. Count how many can be done in 15 sec.\nPylon/cone obstacle course run (Timed):\n\t\t\nRun in and out of the pylons to the end (10 m) and back as fast as you can but at a speed that you feel safe. Do not touch the pylons. Run straight through the finish line. (Pylons located at 3, 5, 7, 10 m)\nBackwards tandem walking (Timed):\n\t\t\nOn the lined track, walk backwards in a tandem pattern for 5 m. Tandem pattern is touching their heel to their opposite toe on each step.\nModified shuttle run (Timed):\n\t\t\nRun along the 10 m track, pick up a beanbag at the end of the course, and run back to place the beanbag in a basket at the starting point. They must touch the starting line with their foot each time they return to the basket. Repeat this three times until all the beanbags are in the basket at the starting point.\nIns and outs (Timed):",
    "Stand with both feet inside of two parallel lines (in the path) that are 40 cm apart. Move one foot outside of the corresponding line followed by the opposite leg moving outside of the other line. The first foot is then returned to the inside, followed by the second foot. Cycles must be consecutive and should be performed in a rhythmical fashion (equal time between each step), and will be repeated 10x not moving forward or backward.\nStanding long jump: Jump forward from standing with both feet as far as you can and hold the landing for 3 sec. Measure and record the distance from the front of the furthest back foot. Three trials are given to achieve the farthest distance\n4. Post-injury/Follow-up Testing\nObtaining post-concussion data while subject is experiencing post-concussion symptoms\n\t\nOn the same day a subject suffers an injury, research staff is contacted by subject using either phone or email. Research staff records clinical and functional details regarding the injury.\nImmediately following concussion (24-48 hr post injury), collect: resting state HRV data (repeat steps 1.3, 1.5-1.10); post-concussion symptom data (repeat step 1.4); and balance data (repeat step 3.1). If symptoms are exacerbated during testing, stop data collection and allow subject to rest.\nContinue to collect resting state HRV data (repeat steps 1.3, 1.5-1.10), post-concussion symptom data (repeat step 1.4), and balance data (repeat step 3.1) weekly until post-concussion symptoms have resolved. If symptoms are exacerbated during testing, stop data collection and allow subject to rest.\nResearch staff follows up with subject weekly by phone to determine when post-concussion symptoms resolve (using PCSI-C).\n5. Obtaining Post-concussion Data While Subject is no Longer Experiencing Post-concussion Symptoms",
    "At 1 week after post-concussion symptoms have resolved, collect: resting state HRV data (repeat steps 1.3, 1.5-1.10); post-concussion symptom data (repeat step 1.4); cognitive performance data (repeat steps 2.1-2.2); balance data (repeat step 3.1); hand grip data (repeat step 3.2); and, agility/motor skills data (repeat step 3.3). If symptoms are exacerbated during testing, stop data collection and allow subject to rest.\nAt 1 month after post-concussion symptoms have resolved, repeat step 5.1. At 3 months after post-concussion symptoms have resolved, repeat step 5.1. At 6 months after post-concussions symptoms have resolved, repeat step 5.1.\nSubscription Required.
