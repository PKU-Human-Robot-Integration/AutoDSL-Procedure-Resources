    "All experimental procedures presented in this protocol have been approved by the Institutional Review Board and are in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\n1. Research Participants\nRecruit individuals who report that they play online games (the gamer group) and those who report that they do not play online games (the non-gamer group).\nNOTE: Here, we included individuals with two or more IGD symptoms according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-523 or those who play games at least one hour per day on average in the gamer group. The non-gamer group undergoes only baseline brain FDG-PET scans to compare rCMRglu with the gamer group and does not receive tDCS sessions.\nFor both groups, exclude individuals with (a) major medical, psychiatric, or neurological disorders, (b) history of traumatic brain injury, (c) history of alcohol or other substance abuse or dependence, (d) use of psychotropic medications, or (e) any contraindications for tDCS such as severe headache, metal in the head, history of seizure, epilepsy, or brain surgery, or any lesions or other medical problems on the skin where tDCS electrodes will be attached.\nExplain to each participant the aim of the study, the main experimental procedures, and any potential risks associated with participating in the study. After answering any questions, obtain written consent.\n2. Baseline Assessment\nEvaluate clinical characteristics using the following questionnaires: Internet Addiction Test (IAT)24 and Brief Self Control Scale (BSCS)25. In addition, ask participants to report average weekly hours spent playing games.\nNOTE: The word \"Internet\" in the IAT is replaced with \"online games\" to assess severity of online game addiction.\nPerform brain FDG-PET scans.",
    "Inject participants with 185 - 222 MBq of FDG and have participants rest for 45 min of an uptake period during which they are awake and resting in supine position in a dark and quiet room with their eyes closed.\nConduct brain FDG-PET scans to acquire transaxial emission images and CT images using a PET-CT scanner in about 15 min. Apply attenuation correction, standard filtering, and standard reconstruction techniques.\n3. Application of tDCS\nWithin a week after the baseline assessment, apply tDCS to participants. Prepare tDCS sessions with following materials: a tDCS device, wet wipes, saline solution, two sponge electrodes (6 cm in diameter), a cable, a headcap, and a headband.\nHave the participant sit on a chair.\nSet the stimulation parameters for the tDCS device: 2 mA for 30 min (current density = 0.07 mA/cm2). Set the current so it ramps up to 2.0 mA over 30 s, remains at 2.0 mA for 29 min, and ramps down to 0 mA over the last 30 s.\nPut the headcap (the International 10-20 system) on the participant’s head and mark the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (F3) and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (F4). Then, remove the headcap from the participant's head.\nPlace two sponge electrodes in the rubber holders of the headband and soak them with saline solution.\nRemove any makeup, dirt, or sweat on the scalp where the electrodes will be applied.\nPlace the headband over the marking points by putting the anodal electrode over the left DLPFC and the cathodal electrode over the right DLPFC.\nConnect the electrodes to the tDCS device using the cable and turn on the device.\nAsk the participant to report any adverse effects during or after the tDCS session.",
    "At the end of the 30 min of stimulation, turn off the device and remove the electrodes from the participant.\nAdminister a total of 12 tDCS sessions (3 times per week for 4 weeks).\n4. Follow-up Assessment\nPerform the follow-up assessment within a week after the last tDCS session using the same protocol as the baseline assessment.\n5. Data Analysis\nUse an appropriate software package to preprocess the PET images (e.g., Statistical Parametric Mapping 12).\nConvert DICOM files to NIFTI files.\nSpatially normalize all PET images to the standard PET template.\nCreate binary masks for the left and right DLPFC (e.g., WFU PickAtlas toolbox). The DLPFC is defined by the middle frontal gyrus in the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas.\nExtract rCMRglu of the left and right DLPFC using the masks (e.g., MarsBaR toolbox). The rCMRglu is normalized to global mean uptake using proportional scaling.\nCalculate asymmetry index (AI) of rCMRglu in the DLPFC as (rCMRglu right - rCMRglu left) / [(rCMRglu right + rCMRglu left) / 2] × 100. Positive AI indicates right-greater-than-left asymmetry of glucose metabolism.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
