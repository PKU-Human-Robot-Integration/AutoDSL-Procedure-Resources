    "Special safety conditions should be applied when working with Leishmania spp. parasites in the laboratory. The main route of exposure is through the use of needles for infecting the ears of the animals. Therefore protective measures should be taken in consideration, i.e., wearing gloves, needle precautions and working under a hood in a P2 plus laboratory. All instruments used for dissection of the tissues should be placed in alcohol 70% recipients and then washed in the presence of chlorine and sterilized.PreparationPrepare 2 ml hard tissue homogenizing tubes containing the ceramic beads and label with the samples identification.Prepare RLT-β-ME buffer (see Recipes).Complement RPE wash buffer with 4 volumes of ethanol (100%).Prepare a dilution of 70% Ethanol using sterile nuclei acids-free water.Label the tubes to be used for the next steps of RNA isolation from the fragmented tissues.Prepare cell culture Petri dish and add 3 ml PBS.Dissection of tissuesAdult C57BL/6J and B6(Cg)-Spp1tm1Blh/J mice at various ages selected for the experiments are anesthetized with CO2.After washing with Ethanol and subsequently with PBS the areas from which the tissues will be isolated, cut the infected with the parasites ear (left ear) and discard the surrounding tissue of the infected area. Isolate a similar area from the right ear (non-infected) to be used for control (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200602/20200602131359_8908.jpgFigure 2.

    "Bioluminescence imaging of luciferase expressing Leishmania amazonensis parasites in infected ear dermis of mice. The color bar indicates the density of the luciferase emission delineating the number of parasites present in the infected area of the ear pinna.Wash rapidly each tissue fragment with PBS and place it in separate homogenizing tubes.After shaving the hair, cut through the skin at the area on the side of each ear and isolate the ear draining lymph nodes from both sides (left side infected and right side to be used as control). Clean the lymph nodes from the surrounding tissue using the glass dissection dish (Figure 1vi).Place the lymph node in a new homogenizing tube.The dissection procedure of the tissues is described on Figure 3.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200602/20200602131415_0702.jpgFigure 3. Step by step procedure for isolation of tissues from mice. Mice, after various times of infection with Leishmania amazonensis parasites at the ear pinna, were sacrificed (1). The infected area of the ear tissue is excised and after a brief wash with PBS in a Petri dish plate, the ear fragment is placed in a Precellys 24 tube containing the beads and the RLT buffer (2). The auricular, ear draining lymph node is surgically removed and placed in a new tube containing the beads and the RLT buffer (3). The lymph node is dense and sinks into the tube liquid. The tissues are homogenized in the Precellys 24 homogenizer (4) and then the homogenate is placed into two new Eppendorf 2 ml tubes for total RNA preparation (5). All procedures involving animals have been approved by the Institutional Committees on animal Welfare under strict accordance with the European guidelines.",
    "RNA isolation from tissuesNote: The description of our procedure for Total RNA preparation follows the protocol of RNA isolation with the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit as supplied by Qiagen with minor modifications. Our starting material was always one ear fragment or one lymph node per preparation. These tissues yielded approximately 10-50 μg of total RNA, depending on the tissue. 1 μg of total RNA yields 1 μg of cDNA. From these cDNA preparations we used 10 ng per Real time PCR reaction.Prepare the tubes that will contain the tissues by adding 1 ml of RLT + β-ME buffer for the ear fragment and 400 μl of the same buffer for the lymph nodes.Add the tissues into the tubes and proceed in tissue fragmentation in the Precellys 24 apparatus. Tissues were homogenized at 600 x g for 60 s, in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMT60IHYDuQ].Take out the tubes from the Precellys 24 and centrifuge at 15,000 x g (13,000 rpm), at room temperature for 2 min.Place 250 μl from the ear homogenate and the entire lymph node homogenate (400 μl) on separate for each tissue DNA retention columns (gDNA Eliminator Spin Column, Qiagen). Centrifuge at 9,000 x g (10,000 rpm) for 90 s.Keep the effluent and discard the DNA separation tubes.Add 175 μl of ethanol 70% into the tubes containing the ear homogenate and 280 μl into the tubes containing the lymph nodes. Use a P1000 Pipetman to well homogenize the samples.Transfer the samples on the RNA retention column (RNeasy spin column, Qiagen) and centrifuge at 9000 x g (10,000 rpm) for 90 s.Eliminate the tube containing the effluent and place the column on a new collection tube (1.5 ml). If DNase treatment is not used continue as in Step C10.",
    "If DNase digestion is performed (with Qiagen kit for RNA preparation), samples (Step C4) are placed directly on the RNA retention columns and additional Steps D1 to 4 are followed.Add on the column 700 μl of RW1 RNA binding buffer (Qiagen) and centrifuge at 9,000 x g (10,000 rpm) for 60 s. Eliminate the effluent but use for the next step the same collector tube.Add on the column 500 μl of RPE + ethanol buffer (ensure that it is at room temperature).Centrifuge the samples at 9,000 x g (10,000 rpm) for 60 s. Eliminate the effluent and reuse the collector tube.Repeat Steps C10 and C11 once more and eliminate the collector tube.Place the column onto a new collector tube and centrifuge at 9,000 x g (10,000 rpm) for 2 min to dry out completely the column.Repeat the centrifugation step once more at 15,000 x g (13,000 rpm) for 2 min.Replace collector tube with a 1.5 ml Eppendorf new tube and proceed to the RNA elution step by adding 30 μl of RNase/DNase-free sterile water on the center of the column for each sample.Centrifuge at 15,000 x g (10,000 rpm) for 60 s.Dilute 1.5 μl of each RNA sample in 20 μl of sterile water in a new tube.1 μl of each diluted sample is used for RNA quantification and quality evaluation, by measurements of the Optical Density (OD) in a NanoDrop  ND-1000  micro spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) (Figure 4).Keep all RNAs at -80 °C until use.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200602/20200602131433_7790.jpgFigure 4. Total RNA concentration and quality evaluation. Representative images of Optical Densities (OD) of RNAs measured by the NanoDrop  ND-1000  micro spectrophotometer. Non-degraded RNA preparation (Sample 1, upper panel) and poor quality (degraded) RNA preparation (Sample 2, lower panel) are shown.",
    "The wavelengths (λ) of 260 nm for nucleic acid (solid blue lines) and 280 nm for protein (dashed blue lines) are indicated. The ratios of absorbance A260/280 (~2.0) and 260/230 (≥ 2.0) indicate the purity of the RNA (ex. absence of organic compounds and protein contaminants respectively). RNAs concentrations are given in ng/μl, taking in consideration 1 OD A260 unit of ssRNA = 40 μg/ml. Low A260/280 concentrations (lower panel) indicate residual contamination of reagents in the preparation and absence of a clear pick of absorbance at A260 indicates a poor quality of RNA (see Note 2).DNase treatment of the samples (Qiagen kit cat. N°  79254  )Add to the RNeasy spin column 350 μl Buffer RW1, close the lid gently and centrifuge at 8,000 x g, for 15 s to wash the spin column membrane. Discard the flow-through.Prepare 70 μl buffer RDD (supplied with the RNase-free DNase Set) in a tube and add 10 μl DNase I stock solution. Mix gently as DNase is sensitive to physical denaturation. Do not vortex.Add 80 μl of the DNase I incubation mix directly into the membrane of the RNeasy spin column and leave on the benchtop for 15 min (20-30 °C).Add 350 μl buffer RW1 to the RNeasy spin column, close the lid gently and centrifuge at 8,000 x g for 15 s. Discard the flow-through and continue with the first RPE buffer wash (Step C11)."
