    "1. Plasma-initiated Polymerization\nPreparing of monomer solution.\n\t\nDissolve HEMA (100 ml; 0.718 mol) in 200 ml water and wash 3x with hexane (100 ml) in a separating funnel. Saturate the aqueous phase with sodium chloride and extract the HEMA with diethyl ether (50 ml). Dry the organic phase over MgSO4 and remove the solvent in vacuo (100 mbar, 40 °C). Distill the HEMA under reduced pressure (15 mbar; 99 °C).\nPrepare a 0.62 M methanolic solution of the inhibitor-free HEMA produced in Section 1.1.1. Pour 30 ml of the solution into a one-necked flask and eliminate oxygen by bubbling Ar through the solution for 1 hr.\nSurface-induced polymerization.\n\t\nPosition two polycarbonate membranes next to each other into the plasma chamber (Figure 2). Place the shiny side of the membrane pointing towards the gas phase.\nConnect the plasma chamber to a high vacuum (20 mbar) for 5 min. Close the valve to the vacuum and open the other valve, which is connected to argon and oxygen gas and purge the chamber with this mixture for 2 hr with 15 sccm argon and 2.5 sccm oxygen.\nInitiate the plasma and reduce the power to the desired power (for polycarbonate membrane: 12 W) and treat the membranes for 4 min with the plasma. Connect the monomer solution with the chamber by opening the corresponding valve. Switch off the plasma and evacuate the chamber.\nConnect the monomer solution with the chamber by opening the corresponding valve and pour the solution into the chamber. Ensure that the membranes are covered with the monomer solution. Open the valve connected to the argon and store the reaction mixture for 12 hr at 20 °C (conditioned room).",
    "Remove the monomer solution. Wash the membranes with methanol in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min. Repeat the washing procedure with water.\nDry the membrane in vacuo over molecular sieves for 2 hr.\n2. Postmodification of Coated Membranes\nPrepare a solution of spirobenzopyran 1 (Figure 1) (100 mg; 0.27 mmol), N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) (55 mg; 0.27 mmol) and dimethyl aminopyridine (DMAP) (33 mg, 0.27 mmol) in tert-butylmetylether (TBME) (12 ml).\nPlace a protecting stirrer bar and a protecting grid into a round-bottom flask. Dry the flask and flood the flask with argon.\nPour the solution into the flask, followed by the coated membrane.\nStir gently at room temperature for 12 hr.\nRemove the solution and wash the membrane with tert-butylmetylether in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min. Repeat the washing procedure with ethanol and water.\nDry the membrane in vacuo over molecular sieves for 2 hr.\n3. Surface Tension Measurements\nFix the membrane with a standard tape on a metal O-ring. Position a drop of nanopure water (3.3 μl) on that part of the membrane surface, which is not in contact with the O-ring. Measure the contact angle (CA) at 5 different spots of the membrane.\nFor testing the long term stability of the samples, measure the contact angles at three different spots of the membranes after 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, and 21 days.\n4. Permeability Tests of the Photochromic Membranes\nFill the receptor chamber of the Franz diffusion cell with water (12 ml).",
    "Fix the membrane in a Franz diffusion cell. Ensure that the membrane is in contact with the water of the receptor chamber. Fill the donor chamber (the chamber on top of the membrane) with an aqueous caffeine solution (20 mM; 3.0 ml). Irradiate the membrane from the top of the donor chamber with white-light (Figure 3). Collect samples (200 μl) from the receptor cell; for track-edged polycarbonate membranes with a pore diameter of 200 nm, collect samples every 10 min.\nRepeat the experiment as described in step 4.2. but irradiate the membrane with UV-light (366 nm, 80 W/m2) during the entire permeability test.\nDetermination of the caffeine concentrations of the collected samples.\n\t\nPlot a calibration curve with 15 different caffeine concentrations (between 0.05 mg/ml and 1.5 mM/L) using a UV/Vis spectrometer. Calibrate at 293 nm.\nDetermine the concentration of each of the collected samples using the calibration curve.\nPlot the determined concentration vs. the time of the collected samples. Make a linear fit through the points and determine Δc from the slope.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
