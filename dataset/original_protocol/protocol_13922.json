    "1. hiPSC maintenance culture\nCoat a six-well culture plate with laminin (Table of Materials).\n\t\nDilute laminin to 0.5 μg/mL in phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\nAdd diluted laminin to a six-well plate at a volume of 2.0 mL/well.\nIncubate the plate at 37 °C for 30 min.\nRemove the laminin solution from the wells.\nSeed hiPSCs in 2 mL of iPSC maintenance medium (Table of Materials) onto the coated wells at a density of 3 × 104 cells/well without drying the surface.\nSubculture the hiPSCs.\n\t\nPrepare 0.5× cell dissociation enzymes (Table of Materials) solution.\n\t\t\nMix 10 μL of 0.5 M Ethylenediaminetetraacetic (EDTA) and 10 mL of PBS to make 0.5 mM EDTA/PBS.\nDilute 10 mL of 1× cell dissociation enzymes to 0.5× by adding 10 mL of 0.5 mM EDTA/PBS.\nAspirate the spent medium from the wells.\nAdd 2 mL/well of PBS to wash the cells, then discard the PBS.\nAdd 800 μL of the 0.5× cell dissociation enzymes, and incubate the cells for 7 min at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.\n\t\tNOTE: 0.05% trypsin-EDTA can be used to dissociate cells.\nGently remove the 0.5× cell dissociation enzymes solution.\nWash the cells with 2 mL PBS, then discard the PBS.\n\t\tNOTE: Be gentle because the cells easily detach after adding cell dissociation enzymes solution.\nAdd 1 mL of iPS maintenance medium (Table of Materials) containing 10 μM Y-27632.\n\t\tNOTE: Adding Y-27632 increases the survival rate of hiPSCs.\nDislodge cells using a cell scraper, and collect them in a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nCount the number of cells. Adjust the cell density to 1.5 × 104 cells/mL by adding iPS maintenance medium containing 10 μM Y-27632.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not use centrifugation in order to prevent cell damage.",
    "Seed 2 mL of cell mixture on the laminin-coated six-well plate (final density: 3 × 104 cells/well).\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.\nReplace the culture medium with iPS maintenance medium without Y-27632 on days 1, 4, 5, and 6.\nSubculture the cells on day 7.\n\tNOTE: Subculture the cells by day 7 in order to inhibit random differentiation of hiPSCs.\n2. Induction of cardiac differentiation of hiPSCs\nCoat a 96-well culture plate with laminin (Table of Materials).\n\t\nDilute laminin to 1.675 μg/mL with PBS.\nAdd the diluted laminin solution to a 96-well plate at a volume of 0.1 mL/well.\nIncubate the plate at 37 °C for 30 min.\nSeed hiPSCs onto a 96-well plate at a density of 3 × 104 cells/well.\nProliferate hiPSCs at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.\n\t\nOne day later, replace the medium with 200 μL/well iPS growth medium (Table of Materials).\nChange the medium every day for an additional 2–3 days until the cells reach 70%–80% confluency.\nApply differentiation media.\n\t\nAspirate the spent medium and replace it slowly with 200 μL/well of pre-warmed differentiation medium A (Table of Materials).\nPlace the plate at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.\nAfter 48 h, aspirate the medium and slowly replace it with 200 μL/well of pre-warmed differentiation medium B (Table of Materials).\nPlace the plate at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.\n\t\tNOTE: It is extremely important that the differentiation media are kept fresh. They will gradually lose their differentiation effect, typically within two weeks. If necessary, aliquot fresh medium and store at −20 °C.\nApply cardiomyocyte maintenance medium.\n\t\nAfter 48 h, aspirate the medium and slowly replace it with 200 μL/well of pre-warmed cardiomyocyte maintenance medium (Table of Materials).",
    "Place the plate at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.\nReplace the cardiomyocyte differentiation medium every other day up to day 30.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important that the duration of the application of differentiation media A and B is accurately set to 48 h to ensure the precise expression sequence of genes required for differentiation.\n3. Exposure to ischemia\nDeprive the culture medium of nutrients and oxygen.\n\t\nPrepare Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) without glucose and serum.\nAspirate culture medium from the wells of the 96-well plate containing hiPS-CMs.\nAdd the nutrient-deprived medium to the wells at a volume of 200 μL/well.\nPlace the culture plate in a hypoxic incubator (Table of Materials).\nInfuse nitrogen gas, and maintain the internal oxygen concentration at 2% and CO2 concentration at 5% for 24 h.\nProceed to desired analyses: e.g., viability assay, assessment of contractility, or assessment of cellular damage.\n4. Assessment of cellular viability using MTT assay\nUse the MTT assay kit (Table of Materials) to quantitatively assess the viability of cells.\n\tNOTE: Exposure to 1 mM hydrogen peroxide in DMEM for 1 h can be used to damage cells (positive control). Exposure to 0 mM hydrogen peroxide in DMEM can be used for the negative control.\n\t\nAdd 10 μL of MTT reagent to the cells using a repeating pipettor.\nMix gently for one minute on an orbital shaker.\nIncubate the cells for 3–4 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. After incubation, the formazan produced in the cells will appear as dark crystals in the bottom of the wells.\nAfter removing the supernatant, dissolve the insoluble formazan crystals in 100 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide solution (DMSO). This solution will dissolve the formazan crystals, producing a purple solution.",
    "CAUTION: DMSO can irritate eyes, respiratory system, and skin. Wear suitable gloves and eye/face protection.\nMeasure the absorbance of each sample with a microplate reader at a wavelength of 570 nm.\n5. Assessment of contractility of iPS-CMs\nIf not installed, obtain Particle Image Velocimetry ImageJ plugin11 at https://sites.google.com/site/qingzongtseng/piv and install.\nUsing a phase contrast microscope, record the video images of hiPS-CMs using the 4× objective lens at ~20 frames per second for ~10 s, and save as “analyze.avi”. For a comparison of contractility between before and after ischemia, confirm that the location of interest is recorded.\n\tNOTE: A microscope with an automated stage is useful to target the location of interest. Movie file should be in .avi format for later analysis. If not, convert the movie to .avi.\nCreate folder structure as indicated in Figure 1. An example of “joblist.txt” is indicated in supplementary file.\nAnalyze discrete two-dimensional vector fields of cellular displacement.\n\t\nLaunch Fiji (ImageJ) software12, go to Plugins > Macros > Edit and open “vector_analysis.ijm” (Supplementary Coding File).\nClick Run. Analysis will be performed automatically.\n\t\tNOTE: Displacement vectors D(x,y) are calculated for every 16 × 16 pixels between the reference frame (the first frame) and all subsequent frames (frames 1 vs. 2, 1 vs. 3, 1 vs. 4, etc.). The result is calculated for every frame and saved as “vec_x.txt” (x is a frame number). A vector of maximum displacement, M(x, y), is defined for every (x, y) pair as follows:imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61104/61104equ01.jpg\n\t\twhere k represents the frame number at which |Dk (x,y)| = max [|D2 (x,y)|, |D3 (x,y)|, …, |Dn (x,y)|] and n denotes the last frame. The result is saved as “Max_vector.txt”. |M(x, y)| represents the maximum displacement caused by cardiomyocyte contraction at the analysis point (x, y). Contractility value C in arbitrary units is calculated as follows:imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61104/61104equ02.jpg",
    "This value is saved at column 7, row 1 in the “Max_vector.txt”. C represents the sum of displacement for all (x, y). The larger the portion where the displacement due to myocardial contraction is large, the larger the value of C. The vector field of maximum displacement, M(x, y), is overlaid with phase contrast image of the first frame (“Phase_contrast.png”) and saved as “Overlaid.png”. As the magnitude of the displacement vector is calculated based on the first frame of the video, it is preferable for the hiPS-CMs to be at resting diastolic period for the first frame.\n6. Assessment of cellular damage using flow cytometry\nDilute a 1 mg/mL solution of propidium iodide to 1:1,000 in PBS.\nStain the detached cells with propidium iodide.\n\t\nAspirate the medium and place it in an appropriately sized centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the tube at 1,000 × g for 5 min, and carefully remove the supernatant so as not to lose sedimented cells.\nIncubate the cells with the diluted propidium iodide solution at room temperature for 15 min in the dark.\nCentrifuge the tube at 1,000 × g for 5 min, and carefully remove the supernatant so as not to lose sedimented cells.\nReconstitute the cells in ~1 mL of PBS.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important to collect detached floating cells from the medium to accurately quantify cellular damage.\nStain attached cells with propidium iodide.\n\t\nWash attached cells twice with PBS gently, then discard PBS.\nIncubate the cells with the diluted propidium iodide solution for 15 min in the dark.\nAspirate the propidium iodide solution.\nDetach the cells using 0.25% trypsin. Move the cell solution into a centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the tube at 1,000 × g for 5 min, and carefully remove the supernatant so as not to lose sedimented cells.",
    "Reconstitute the cells in ~1 mL of PBS.\nMix the floating and attached cells for fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis.\nPass the cell solution through a 30 μm filter.\n\tNOTE: Passing the cells to a filter is very important for an accurate FACS measurement.\nAnalyze the samples using a FACS system.\n7. Immunostaining\nFix the cell sample.\n\t\nAspirate the culture medium.\nAdd 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature.\nWash the cells three times with PBS.\n\t\tNOTE: Fresh paraformaldehyde solution is recommended for optimal fixation.\nPermeabilize the cells with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min, then discard the reagent.\nAdd 3% bovine serum albumin to block the cells for 30 min.\nApply primary antibody.\n\t\nDiscard bovine serum albumin solution from the culture plate.\nIncubate the cells with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C.\nRemove the antibody solution.\nWash the cells three times with PBS.\nApply secondary antibody.\n\t\nDiscard PBS solution from the culture plate.\nIncubate the cells with secondary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature in the dark.\n\t\tNOTE: Primary anti-cardiac troponin T (TNNT2) mouse monoclonal antibody is used at a dilution of 1:750 in 3% BSA. The Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary goat anti-mouse antibody is diluted to 1:1,000 in 3% BSA.\nAdditional staining of nucleus and actin fibers.\n\t\nRemove the antibody solution.\nIncubate the cells in nucleus staining reagent (Table of Materials) and actin staining reagent (Table of Materials) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature in the dark.\n\t\tNOTE: 4’, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) or Hoechst 33342 can be used for nuclear staining.\nWash the cells three times with PBS.\nCapture fluorescence images using a fluorescence microscope."
