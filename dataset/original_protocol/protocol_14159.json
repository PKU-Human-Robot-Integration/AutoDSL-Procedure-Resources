    "All procedures, including animal subjects, have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Seoul National University Hospital (IACUC No. 10-0184). This protocol is optimized for research on flap vasculature. This example is based on a four-territory flap model in our previous reports.\n1. Establishing a Flap Condition\nNOTE: It is important to generate a vascular change in a rat flap model 4 to 5 days before visible estimation6,7.\nUse 7-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200 - 250 g.\nAnesthetize the rats using isoflurane at 3 - 5% for induction and 2 - 2.5% for maintenance. Perform a toe pinch withdrawal reflection test to confirm that the depth of anesthesia is sufficient.  Inject meloxicam 5mg/kg subcutaneously for pain relief.\nShave the trunk using an animal hair clipper and hair removal cream (thioglycolic acid, 80%). Prepare a sterile surgical field with 10% povidone-iodine and a sterile drape to maintain a sterile condition throughout the procedures. Apply a vet ointment to the eyes to prevent dryness. Maintain all instruments in sterile condition.\nEstablish the appropriate the flap condition.\n\t\nMark a circumferential skin flap design from the lower abdomen to the back, measuring 4 x 12 cm. Locate the center of the flap halfway between the xiphoid process and the penis (Figure 1).\nMake the incision as marked using a surgical blade.\nDissect the flap using scissors, including the skin and panniculus carnosus.\nDissect around the vascular pedicle [bilateral deep circumflex iliac (DCI) vessels and bilateral superficial inferior epigastric (SIE) vessels] at the lower abdomen and expose the vascular pedicle using a surgical loupe and microsurgical instruments.\nMaintain or ligate the vessels depending on the desired conditions.\nDivide the flap along the dorsal midline using a surgical blade or scissors.",
    "Lay the flap in its original position and fix it with a skin stapler.\nApply a topical ointment to the surgical wound for 3 days and provide postoperative analgesia by administering meloxicam at a dose of 5 mg/kg orally once per day for 3 days.\nConfirm that the rat regains sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Return the rat into the cage and move it to the housing area. Apply an Elizabethan collar to each rats.\n2. Preparation of the Instruments\nPrepare a 24G catheter and a three-way stopcock.\nPrepare mosquito forceps, small scissors, a surgical scalpel, and a surgical blade.\nPrepare the angiographic agent (silicone rubber injection compound).\n\t\nBlend the color agent compound with the diluent in the sterile specimen collection cup. Ensure an equal quantity by weight: 15 mL of color agent compound and 15 mL of MV diluent in one rat (Sprague-Dawley rat, 200 - 250 g).\nAdd the curing agent per 5% weight or volume of the mixture solution immediately before injection: 1.5 mL of curing agent in one rat (Sprague-Dawley rat, 200 - 250 g).\n3. Rat Artery Preparation\nUse isoflurane to anesthetize the rats (3 - 5% for induction and 2 - 2.5% for maintenance). Perform a toe pinch withdrawal reflection test to confirm that the depth of anesthesia is sufficient.\nShave the neck using an animal hair clipper and hair removal cream (thioglycolic acid, 80%). \nExpose the common carotid artery10.\n\t\nMake a 2-cm midline incision between the scapulae.\nDissect more deeply using mosquito forceps and blunt scissors until the salivary gland complex is exposed.\nRetract the salivary gland and bluntly dissect the omohyoid muscle longitudinally.\nDissect around the common carotid artery.\nHook the cephalic and caudal sides of the common carotid artery with black silk and affix it.",
    "Make a tie on proximal suture and keep traction to maintain engorgement of the artery.\nPrepare one silk suture at the caudal side for securing of 24G catheter.\n4. Cannulation\nCannulate the prepared carotid artery using a 24G catheter.\nTighten the pre-made tie in the caudal side and be careful to not remove the catheter during injection.\nPrepare the curing agent (step 1.3.2).\nConnect the three-way stopcock securely to the inserted catheter.\n\t\nConfirm regurgitated blood into the catheter by adding negative pressure using an empty syringe.\n5. Injection\nInject the silicone rubber injection compound until the color of the eye and foot has changed.\n\t​NOTE: The color change should appear as the injected fluid progresses (injection amount is approximately 25 - 30 mL for each rat).\nLock the three-way stopcock and wait until the agent solidifies.\n\t\nBe careful not to contaminate with the agent, especially when removing the syringe from the three-way stopcock. Use a protective barrier such as gauze or vinyl to separate the injection space from its surroundings.\n\t\tCAUTION: Any contamination makes it difficult to analyze the angiographic image because the compound is radio-opaque.\nConfirm the cessation of heartbeats and respiration. Stop the anesthesia.\nObserve the rate of hardness with the remaining agent as a reference (approximately 15 min needed).\n6. Harvesting of Specimen\nMake an incision using a surgical blade to the panniculus carnosus 1 cm outside the flap to prevent damage to any vascular structure inside the flap.\nDissect along the previously dissected plane from step 1.4 (under the panniculus carnosus plane) and harvest the tissue including the flap and vascular pedicle using scissors (the vascular structure is included in the flap).",
    "Ligate the pedicle of the flap using a 5-0 silk suture and separate the flap from the body. Be careful not to damage the vascular structure.\n7. Capturing the Angiographic Image\nSpread out the specimen, ensuring that it does not fold, and gently place it on the surgical drape using forceps.\nTake a radiography image.\n\t\nTransfer the specimen lying on the film cassette to the sample loading space.\nSet the soft tissue X-ray system to 60 kVp, 5 mA, and 5 s exposure.\nDevelop the film in a darkroom using an automatic development machine.\nScan the film at the highest resolution possible.\n8. Analyzing the Image6,7,11\nDistinguish the arteries and veins based on the continuity of flow and diameter.\n\t\nStart from the inflow of the pedicle artery and focus on the target vessel being examined.\nMeasure the diameters with software by first opening the image.\n\t\t\nClick the Straight button and draw a line on the scale bar that is the same length.\nOpen the Analyze | Set scale menu and enter the value of the scale bar into Known distance.\nClick the Straight button and draw a line onto the vessel of which the diameter needs to be measured.\nOpen the Analyze | Measure menu and confirm the Length.\nAnalyze the vascular pattern considering the flap survival area.\nSubscription Required.
