    "All experimental procedures including animal subjects have been approved by the Institutional Animals Care and Use Committee at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n1. Maintaining a Rat Colony\nBreed Sprague-Dawley rats (see the Table of Materials) and maintain them in standard conditions with a 12-h light-dark cycle and ad libitum access to food and water.\nWean the rat pups at postnatal day (P) 28 and house them in groups of 2 - 4 male or female littermates.\nMark the tails of male rats with a non-toxic permanent black marker for identification.\nWeigh the male rats 3 times per week and record their bodyweights.\n2. Preparation of an ECS Machine\nAt 7:30 am, disinfect the bench in the animal preparation room and place an ECS machine (pulse generator) on the bench.\nPlace an individual male rat weighing 200 - 250 g in a clean, empty cage with a lid. Repeat this for all male rats to be treated with ECS induction. Let the rats habituate for 30 min.\nWhile the rats are habituating in their cages, set a pulse generator for ECS induction to the frequency of 100 pulses/s, a pulse width of 0.5 ms, a shock duration of 0.5 s, and a current of 55 mA (Figure 1A).\nPrepare the pulse generator by pushing the \"RESET\" button and ensuring that the \"READY\" button is lit. Make sure that the ear clips are not attached to a pulse generator and then press the \"SHOCK\" button for a few seconds.\n\tNOTE: At this point, the pulse generator is ready for ECS induction.\nPlug the ear clips into the pulse generator.\n3. Induction of Acute ECS\nNOTE: See Figure 1B, top panel.\nWet the ear clips with sterile saline and ensure that they are saturated.",
    "Wet a rat's ears with sterile saline by wrapping them in saline-soaked gauze. Once they are wet, remove the gauze.\nAttach one clip per ear, position beyond the main cartilage band.\nConfirm on the ECS machine that a true loop is established; if not, an error message or a reading of \"1\" will appear on the machine.\nWear a thick, non-metal glove. While holding the rat gently in a gloved hand, press the \"SHOCK\" button for a few seconds and slowly release the grip on the rat to observe the seizure. For the sham \"no seizure\" (NS) control, handle the rat identically but do not deliver the current.\nDisconnect the ear clips as clonus begins and record the seizure behavior according to a revised Racine's scale22 that includes \"mouth and facial movements\" (stage 1), \"head nodding\" (stage 2), \"forelimb clonus\" (stage 3), \"rearing with forelimb clonus\" (stage 4), and \"rearing and falling with forelimb clonus\" (stage 5). The seizure should last approximately 10 s; record the seizure duration using a timer.\nFollowing seizure termination, return the rat to its home cage. Monitor the rat for another 5 min to make sure of the recovery of the rat from the seizures. Keep it singly housed in the cage and return the cage to the recovery room.\nRepeat the ECS induction on the next rat.\nMonitor the rats throughout the remainder of the day and at least once in the morning and once in the afternoon the following day until they are euthanized for experiments.",
    "NOTE: The ECS induction method could lead to clinical signs as an incidental side effect, which requires attention. For example, the ECS induction protocol could induce seizures that last longer than 15 s and cause unnecessary distress to the rats. In this case, terminate the seizure using diazepam (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or pentobarbital (25 - 30 mg/kg, i.p.). If the rats develop respiratory distress or severe behavioral abnormalities following seizure cessation, euthanize them by carbon dioxide inhalation followed by decapitation.\n4. Induction of Chronic ECS\nNOTE: See Figure 1B, bottom panel.\nInduce one ECS per day at the same time in the morning as described in steps 1 - 3, above, for seven consecutive days.\nMonitor the rats twice a day after they are returned to their home cages.\n5. Homogenization and Fractionation of Rat Hippocampi\nNOTE: See Figure 2.\nPrepare a fresh homogenization buffer (Solution A) that contains 320 mM sucrose, 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 200 nM okadaic acid, and protease inhibitors. Filter-sterilize the buffer using filters with a 0.22 µm pore size for vacuum filtration and place it on ice.\nAt a given time point following acute ECS or chronic ECS (Figure 1), euthanize the rat by CO2 inhalation for 5 - 10 min, followed by decapitation using a guillotine.\nRemove the brain and dissect the hippocampi on the metal plate placed on ice, as described previously23,24.\nPlace two hippocampi from one rat onto a 30-mm tissue culture dish and mince them into small pieces using scissors.",
    "Transfer the minced hippocampi to a manual glass homogenizer using a 1 mL pipette and add 1 mL of ice-cold homogenization buffer (Solution A, step 5.1). Insert a round pestle into a glass homogenizer. While the glass homogenizer is on ice, gently and steadily stroke up and down on the pestle 10 - 15 times for 1 min, until small pieces of hippocampal tissue disappear.\nTransfer the homogenate to a 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube using a 1-mL pipette and centrifuge the homogenate at 800 x g for 10 min at 4 °C to separate the postnuclear supernatant (S1 fraction) from the pellet containing insoluble tissue and nuclei (P1 fraction). Transfer 50 µL and 950 µL of the S1 fraction to two separate, new 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tubes using a 1 mL pipette and store these tubes on ice. Save the P1 fraction pellet on ice.\nCentrifuge the S1 fraction (950 µL) for 10 min at 13,800 x g and 4 °C to separate the supernatant (S2 fraction), enriched with cytosolic-soluble proteins, and the pellet (P2 fraction), enriched with membrane-bound proteins, including synaptosomal proteins. Transfer the S2 fraction to a new 1.7 mL microcentrifuge using a 1-mL pipette and store it on ice.\nResuspend the pellet (P2 fraction) in 498 µL of ice-cold purified water using a 1-mL pipette. Add 2 µL of 1 M HEPES (pH 7.4) using a 20 µL pipette to achieve a final concentration of 4 mM HEPES (pH 7.4). Incubate at 4 °C with agitation for 30 min. Store the resuspended P2 fraction on ice.",
    "Determine the protein concentration of the S1, S2, and P2 fractions using a BCA assay. Add 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) to each fraction to achieve a 1 mg/mL concentration and store at -80 °C until use, or process the P2 fraction to isolate the PSD.\n6. Isolation of the PSD from the Crude Membrane Protein (P2) Fraction\nCentrifuge the P2 fraction (500 µL) for 20 min at 25,000 x g and 4 °C to separate the lysed supernatant (LS2 fraction) and the lysed pellet (LP1 fraction). Transfer the LS2 fraction to a new 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube using a 1 mL pipette and store it on ice.\nResuspend the LP1 pellet in 250 µL of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) mixed with 250 µL of 1% detergent in 1x PBS buffer using a 1 mL pipette. Incubate at 4 °C with gentle agitation for 15 min.\nCentrifuge the resuspended LP1 pellet for 3 h at 25,000 x g and 4 °C to separate the supernatant (non-PSD fraction) from the pellet (PSD fraction). Remove the supernatant to a 1.7-mL microcentrifuge tube and resuspend the PSD pellet in 100 µL of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) using a 200 µL pipette.\nDetermine the protein concentration of the LS2, non-PSD, and PSD fractions using a BCA assay. Add 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) to each fraction to achieve a 1 mg/mL concentration and store at -80 °C until use.\n\tNOTE: All solutions used in steps 5 - 6 (i.e., Solution A, HEPES buffer, and PBS buffer) should be made with purified water free of ionic and organic contaminants and particles.\n7. Western Blotting",
    "Thaw each protein fraction on ice. Transfer 12 µL of each fraction (S2, P2, and PSD in 1 mg/mL) to a new 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube using a 20-µL pipette.\nAdd 3 µL of 5x SDS sample buffer and incubate at 75 °C for 30 min in a water bath. Cool the sample down to room temperature (RT).\nLoad 10 µL of the protein sample into each well of 4-20% gradient 15-well comb SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel using a 20 µL pipette. Run the gel in the SDS-PAGE apparatus and at 80-100 V in running buffer (25 mM Tris, 190 mM glycine, and 0.1% SDS; pH 8.3).\n\tNOTE: Each gel should contain protein samples from NS rats and ECS rats at different time points following acute or chronic ECS.\nTransfer the proteins from the SDS-PAGE gel to a polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF) membrane in the transfer apparatus at 25 - 30 V (60 mA) for 9 - 12 h in transfer buffer (25 mM Tris, 190 mM glycine, and 20% methanol; pH 8.3).\nRemove the PVDF membrane from the transfer apparatus and wash it in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 5 min on a multi-purpose rotator at RT.\nBlock the membrane in 5% milk and 0.1% Tween-20 in TBS for 1 h. Incubate it in primary antibodies (Table 1) in washing buffer (1% milk and 0.1% Tween-20 in TBS) overnight on a multi-purpose rotator at 4 °C (see the Table of Materials for dilutions).\nWash the membrane 4 times for 10 min each in wash buffer and then incubate it with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies in washing buffer for 1 h on a multi-purpose rotator at RT.\nWash the membrane 4 times for 10 min each in wash buffer and then with TBS for 5 min.",
    "Incubate the membrane with enhanced chemifluorescence substrate for 1 min and expose it to X-ray film. Develop the exposed film with a film processor.\n8. Quantification of Western Blots\nScan the Western blot as a TIFF file and save this file to the computer.\nOpen the Western blot file in the ImageJ program as a grayscale image, under \"File,\" \"Open image,\" right arrow \"gray-scale.\"\nChoose the rectangular selection tool from the ImageJ toolbar and draw a rectangle that covers a single Western blot band of a protein of interest.\nUnder \"Analyze,\" hit \"Measure\" to obtain the area and the mean density of a selected band.\nMove the rectangle to a background area without changing its size and shape. Repeat step 8.4 to the area and the mean density of a background.\nSubtract the mean density value of a background band from that of a Western blot band, giving the background-subtracted band density of the protein of interest.\nRepeat steps 8.2 - 8.6 for all Western blot bands of interest.\nDivide the background-subtracted band density of the protein of interest by the background-subtracted band density of a housekeeping gene product, such as α-Tubulin; this step yields the normalized value of the protein of interest.\nSubscription Required.
