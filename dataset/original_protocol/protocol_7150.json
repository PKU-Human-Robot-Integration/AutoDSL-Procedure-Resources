    "Anti-Dld antibody uptake assay in the one day post fertilization (1dpf) zebrafish brainAntibody conjugation: Mix 1 μL of anti-Dld antibody (0.5 mg/mL) with 2.5 μL of Anti-Mouse-IgG-Atto647N antibody (1 mg/mL) and incubate at room temperature for 30 min, or on ice for 2–3 h. From this step, the mixture should be protected from light.Blocking of unconjugated antibody: Add 2.5 μL of blocking buffer (10 mg/mL of mouse IgG with 5 mM azide, supplied by Sigma-Aldrich with the order of anti-Mouse-Atto647N) and 0.5 μL of 0.5% Phenol red (Sigma P0290) for blocking the unconjugated Anti-Mouse-IgG-Atto647N. Vortex thoroughly, and incubate the mixture at room temperature for 5–10 min. Mixtures without anti-Dld antibody were used as control.Microinjection: Anaesthetize 24–26 h post fertilization (hpf) embryos in the Danieau medium supplemented with 0.003% tricaine, followed by embedding in 1.2% low-melt point agarose. The zebrafish microinjection platform is the same as previously described (Dong et al., 2011). Inject 10 nL of labelled Dld antibody into the hindbrain ventricle. Release the injected embryos from agarose and culture them in the Danieau medium for 3–4 h.Before proceeding to fixation and immunostaining, monitor the effects of the antibody uptake assay under a spinning-disk confocal microscope.Fixation and cryosectioning of zebrafish embryosCollect embryos from the last step, wash them in PBS twice, and then transfer them to Eppendorf tubes with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight at 4°C in 1× PBS buffer.Wash the fixed embryos three times with 1× PBS (5 min each time) and incubate them in 1× PBS buffer containing 30% sucrose overnight at 4°C.Transfer the embryos to plastic molds for preparing frozen samples with soft tips, remove the sucrose buffer, and add the OCT (Tissue-tek). After orienting the embryos to proper positions in the mold, freeze the block on dry ice.",
    "Blocks can be stored at -80°C up to several months.Cut frozen blocks into 20 μm sections on a cryostat (Leica). After placing the sections on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific), these slides were dried at room temperature for 2–3 h and then stored at -80°C until use.Whole mount fluorescent immunostainingWash the frozen cryosections in PBS-T for 5 min, then preincubate them in blocking buffer at 4°C overnight or longer.After blocking, incubate the cryosections with primary antibodies in the blocking buffer overnight at 4°C.For those samples that do not continue with LR-ExM, thoroughly wash the cryosections with PBS-T five times × 10 min each time, and incubate with Alexa®-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Alexa 568), goat anti-chicken (Alexa 488), goat anti-mouse (Alexa 488), or goat anti-guinea pig (Alexa 647) secondary antibodies (diluted 1:1,000) in the blocking buffer, for over 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C.Wash the samples with PBS-T twice, and then three times with PBS (10 min each).Incubate the samples with 50% glycerol in PBS for 1 h, followed by infiltration overnight in 80% glycerol/PBS before imaging.Label Retention Expansion Microscopy (LR-ExM)For the cryosections to be used for LR-ExM, after primary antibody incubation as described above, they were incubated with trifunctional linkers [NHS-MA-Biotin conjugated anti-Chicken (or anti-Rabbit) IgG—for visualizing Par-3, and NHS-MA-DIG conjugated anti-Guinea Pig IgG—for visualizing Dlic1 (200 mg/mL stock, dilute 1:100 before use)] in the blocking buffer overnight at 4°C in the dark.After washes in PBS (5 min each) in the dark, add 40 μL of freshly prepared gelation solution onto each section to cover the whole tissue sample. The gelation solution was prepared by deoxygenizing the gel monomer solution using a vacuum pump for over 15 min, before adding TEMED and APS, to enhance the effects of trifunctional linkers.",
    "Protect the sections from light, incubate in a humidity chamber, and allowe to undergo gelation at 37°C for 1 h.Incubate the gelated samples in the digestion buffer (see Recipes) on the slides at 37°C for 4 h or at room temperature overnight. At least 10-fold excess volume of digestion buffer was used (> 5 mL for each slide). Sufficient digestion enables sections embedded in gels to slide off the glass surface.Wash the gel embedded samples with excess volume of 150 mM NaCl in 6-well plates of at least 5 mL in each well for four times (20–30 min each time).After washing off the digestion buffer, incubate the gel samples in the post-digestion staining buffer (see Recipes) with 3–5 μM Alexa Fluor® 488-Streptavidin, 3–5 μM goat anti-Digoxigenin/Digoxin Dylight® 594, anti-mouse Atto647N (1:500), and DAPI (1:1,000) in the dark at 4°C for 24 h.Wash the gel embedded samples four times with Milli-Q water (30 min for each wash) in the dark at 4°C. The samples expand to approximately four times their original size after washing and are then ready for imaging.Confocal microscopyImmuno-stained samples without LR-ExM were scanned using a confocal microscope (Nikon CSU-W1 Spinning Disk/High Speed Widefield confocal microscopy, Nikon Imaging Core at UCSF) at 0.26 μm z-step size, with a 100× Oil objective. LR-ExM samples were scanned with the same confocal microscope at 0.26 μm z-step size, with a 60× water immersion (WI) objective."
