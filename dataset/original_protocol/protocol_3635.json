    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIn vitro transcription initiation assay\nTiming: 1 day\nThis assay measures transcription runoff and abortive RNA synthesis.\nPrepare 1:1 mixtures of respective template and non-template DNA oligonucleotides (10 μM each) in standard 1× TE buffer with 50 mM NaCl. Place the tubes containing the mixtures in a heating block set at 95°C for 10 min. Switch off the heating block and allow it to cool to 25°C to promote annealing of the oligonucleotides.\nPreincubate 2 μM yeast 21S rRNA promoter DNA fragment or the pre-melted 15S initiation bubble promoter with y-mtRNAP (1 μM), and WT or mutant MTF1 (2 μM) in transcription initiation reaction buffer at 25°C.\nInitiate RNA synthesis by adding 100 μM each ATP, UTP, GTP, and 1.25 mM 3′-dCTP spiked with α-32P-GTP.\nTerminate reactions after 15 min using 125 mM EDTA and formamide dye mixture (98% formamide, 0.025% bromophenol blue, 10 mM EDTA).\nResolve RNA products on a 24% polyacrylamide, 4 M urea gel.\nExpose the gel image to a phosphor plate, scan, and analyze using ImageQuant to calculate the molar runoff RNA products.\n2-Aminopurine assay for DNA melting and initiating NTP binding\nTiming: 1 day\nThis assay measures promoter melting and initiating NTP Kd using 2-aminopurine for both labeling promoter DNA as a fluorescent molecular marker and as a purine analog that can base pair with either thymine or cytosine.\nSynthesize yeast 21S rRNA promoter DNA fragment with 2-aminopurine (2AP) at position -4 in the non-template strand or -1 in the template strand (IDT).\nTo assay for promoter melting, prepare samples of 2-aminopurine assay buffer alone, -4 2AP DNA alone (200 nM), DNA (200 nM) with 400 nM y-mtRNAP and 400 nM MTF1 WT or mutants.",
    "Measure fluorescence intensity (excitation at 315 nm and emission 380 nm) in a FluoroMax spectrometer (Hiroba Scientific) at 25°C.\nPlot the intensity of each sample.\nTo determine the Kd of initiating NTPs, use the promoter DNA labeled with 2AP at position -1 in the template strand.\nAdd increasing concentrations of initiating nucleotides (ATP+GTP) to a complex of -1 2AP promoter DNA (200 nM), y-mtRNAP (400 nM), and MTF1 WT or mutants (400 nM) and measure fluorescence emission intensity (380 nm after excitation at 315 nm).\nPlot the titration data and estimate the cumulative Kd of the initiating nucleotides by fitting to a hyperbolic equation Fc = Fm∗[N]/Kd+[N], where Fc is the fluorescence intensity at a given concentration of ATP+GTP (N), and Fm is the maximum fluorescence change.\nUltrafiltration assay to monitor y-mtRNAP-MTF1 interaction\nTiming: 1 day\nThis assay analyzes complex formation between y-mtRNAP and MTF1 using ultrafiltration.\nAn equimolar complex of y-mtRNAP and MTF1 (2 μM each) is mixed in ultrafiltration assay buffer in a final volume of 500 μL.\nIncubate the mixture at 25°C for 15 min.\nFilter through a 100 kDa MW cut-off Microcon centrifugal filter unit (Millipore Sigma) at 2,000 × g until the first retentate volume is about 50 μL (1/10 of initial volume).\nDilute the retentate to 500 μL with the above buffer and filter again. Repeat this washing step, and take a sample after each wash. Collect samples consisting of the initial protein complex, first retentate, filtrate, and retentate samples and analyze on a 4%–20% SDS-PAGE.\nAssembly and characterization of initiation complex (IC) and partially melted initiation complex (PmIC)\nTiming: 2 days\nPrepare the y-mtRNAP PmIC by incubating ΔN100 y-mtRNAP, MTF1, and promoter DNA in a molar ratio 1:1.2:1.2 for 2 h at 4°C.",
    "The complex at a starting concentration of 6 mg/mL in buffer A is purified by size-exclusion chromatography. A Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column is mounted on a GE AKTA Pure 25 FPLC in-line with Wyatt Technology multi-angle light scattering (MALS) device mini-DAWN, differential refractive index (dRI) measuring device Optilab, and dynamic light scattering (DLS) device DynaPro Nanostar. The purification is carried out at 6°C.\nThe purified y-mtRNAP complex sample was concentrated to 2.7 mg/mL in buffer A, aliquoted, and stored at −80°C without flash freezing. The calculated extinction coefficient is 542,608 M−1cm−1 at 280 nm. For the contribution from the two DNA strands, this coefficient was approximated by dividing the calculated coefficient at 260 nm by two.\nThe transcription initiation complex (y-mtRNAP IC) is prepared by incubating y-mtRNAP PmIC, 2-mer RNA, and UTPαS at a molar ratio of 1:6:50 for 2 h on ice.\nFor the Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) experiments, add 8 μL of the y-mtRNAP IC or ymtRNAP PmIC complex at a concentration of ˜0.5 mg/mL into a Wyatt disposable cuvette. Place the sample cuvette in the sample chamber maintained at 4°C. Acquire 30 readings for each sample, and analyze the data using Dynamics (Version 7.10.0.23) software (Wyatt Technology).\nThermal shift assay of y-mtRNAP with and without bubble DNA\nTiming: 1 day\nThermal shift assay (Huynh and Partch, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) show a higher y-mtRNAP PmIC stability compared to that of the y-mtRNAP-only sample.\nThe thermal shift experiment is conducted in quadruplicate using a ThermoFisher QuantStudio5 qPCR setup and Protein Thermal ShiftTM dye (Applied Biosystems, Cat. NO. 4461146) in 96 well format. Each well contains 5 μg of protein in a volume of 20 μL of 1× buffer A and 1× Protein Thermal ShiftTM dye.",
    "The temperature is ramped from 4°C–95°C at a rate of 3°C/min. The fluorescence from the dye is measured at 623 ± 14 nm wavelength while using an excitation wavelength of 580 ± 10 nm.\nThe data are analyzed using Protein Thermal Shift 1.3 software. The Tm of y-mtRNAP PmIC is 47°C compared to 42°C for y-mtRNAP-only sample, showing higher stability of the complex.\nCryo-EM structure determination of y-mtRNAP IC and PmIC\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nPmIC and IC complexes were detected in one preparation of the complex of y-mtRNAP, MTF1, bubble DNA, 2-mer RNA, and UTP αS.\nPrepare vitreous grids of y-mtRNAP IC on Quantifoil R 1.2/1.3 holey carbon grids using a Leica EM GP. Glow-discharge grids for 30 s at 10 mA current with the chamber pressure set at 0.30 mBar (PELCO easiGlow; Ted Pella). Place the grids prior to glow-discharge over a filter paper soaked with chloroform for two hours and air dry for 16 h.\nMount the glow-discharged grids in the sample chamber of a Leica EM GP at 8°C and 95% relative humidity, blot, and plunge-freeze in liquid ethane at temperature −172°C.\nThe frozen grids are tested on a JEM-1400 transmission electron microscope (TEM) at VUB Brussels, and the grid preparation conditions are optimized in cycles. The final optimized grids are reproducibly prepared using 5 μL of sample at a concentration of 1 mg/mL in buffer A spotted on Quantifoil R 1.2/1.3 holey carbon grids, incubated on the grid for 30 s, and back blotted for 12 – 14 s using two pieces of Whatman Grade 1 filter paper. The grids of y-mtRNAP PmIC are prepared using the conditions used for y-mtRNAP IC grids.",
    "High-resolution datasets for y-mtRNAP IC and y-mtRNAP PmIC are collected at ESRF-Grenoble CM01 facility using a 300 kV Titan KRIOS TEM equipped with a Gatan K2 Summit direct electron detector and a Gatan energy filter (Kandiah et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). The data collection for y-mtRNAP PmIC is automated using EPU version 2.5 (ThermoFisher). Electron movies are collected in the counting mode at a nominal magnification of 165,000×. The total exposure time was 6 s with a total dose of 65 e-/ Å 2 and the movies are recorded as gain corrected MRC files. Images for y-mtRNAP IC sample are collected using EPU software version 2.6.1 (ThermoFisher) in the counting mode again at a nominal magnification of 165,000× yielding a pixel size of 0.827 Å . The exposure time was 5 s for each movie, accumulating to a total dosage of 61 e-/Å2. The beam-image shift is applied during data collection to increase data throughput. Movies are recorded as compressed MRC files. For both data collections, the energy filter is used with a slit width of 20 eV.\nAll frames in individual movies are aligned using MotionCor2 (Zheng et al., 2017) as implemented in Scipion (de la Rosa-Trevin et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nContrast-transfer-function (CTF) estimations are performed using CTFFIND-4 (Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nA preliminary dataset collected from a cryo-EM grid of y-mtRNAP IC using a 200 kV Glacios/Falcon-3EC setup revealed the existence of IC and PmIC states. A reference set of thirteen 2D classes was obtained from 18,648 particles picked using Xmipp picker.\nThe particles are classified into thirteen 2D classes using Relion 3.0.8 (Zivanov et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]), and the set of thirteen classes is used as the template for picking the particles from high-resolution y-mtRNAP PmIC and y-mtRNAP IC datasets using Autopick routine of Relion 3.0.8",
    "For the final map calculations, 1–48 out of 60 frames for y-mtRNAP PmIC and 1–42 out of 50 frames for y-mtRNAP IC are re-aligned using the Relion-implemented MotionCor2.\nThe particles are re-extracted, fitting of CTF parameter and per-particle defocus was applied using Relion 3.0.8 prior to the final map calculation using Refine3D.\nMaps are B-sharpened using the Postprocessing routine in Relion. The final maps are calculated at 3.1 Å and 3.7 Å (FSC 0.143), respectively, for y-mtRNAP PmIC and y-mtRNAP IC structures. The local resolutions of the maps are calculated using ResMap (Kucukelbir et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nThe model building is done manually using COOT (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). The structures of h-mtRNAP in hmtRNAP IC (PDB Id. 6EQR) and of T7 RNAP in T7 RNAP IC (PDB Id. 1QLN) are used as references while building the model for y-mtRNAP. The crystal structure of MTF1 (PDB Id. 1I4W) is modeled into its part of the density.\nThe real-space fitting of the model to the density map is carried out using Phenix 1.16 (Liebschner et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).
