    "Candida growth Use a sterile inoculating loop to remove culture from the glycerol stock culture (-80 °C) and inoculate a YPD plate (Table 1, Day 1).Table 1. Protocol steps table:\n﻿Total time,Workflow,Condition\nDay 1,Streak C. albicans on YPD plate,Incubate for 24 h at 30 °C in the standby incubator\nDay 2,\"Inoculate a small, round colony into 10 mL of YPD broth\",Incubate for 14–16 h at 30 °C until mid-logarithmic phase in a shaking incubator at 200 rpm\nDay 3,Prepare 24-well plate with culture for biofilm growth,Incubate for 24 h at 37 °C in a shaker at 75 rpm\nDay 4,\"After removing the non-adherent cells, add antifungal agents for biofilm inhibition experiments\",\"Again, incubate for 24 h at 37 °C in a shaker at 75 rpmNote: Low shaking speed reduces the chance of biofilm detachment from the bottom surface of the plate.\"\nDay 5,Assess biofilm by imaging in brightfield,",
    "Incubate the plate at 30 °C for 24–36 h.Inoculate a single colony from the cultured plate into a sterile 100 mL conical flask containing 10 mL of YPD broth (Table 1, Day 2).Incubate the flask at 30 °C for 16 h with constant shaking at 200 rpm (Figure 1).Biofilm formation Measure the OD600 of the overnight Candida culture and dilute in YPD medium supplemented with 10% FBS to a starting concentration of 107 CFU/mL (Table 1, Day 3).Note: Use a standard CFU method (Miller, 1972) or direct microscopic count using Petroff-Hausser counting chambers. Distribute 500 μL of the Candida suspension to each well of a 24-well tissue culture plate (plate 1) and incubate at 37 °C for 24 h without shaking. For the blank, add 500 μL of YPD medium supplemented with 10% FBS.Note: For static biofilms, the plate must remain stationary. The next day, gently remove the media and non-adherent cells from each well (Figure 1).Note: Tilting the 24-well plates and gently placing the pipette tip in the corner of the well helps to prevent disruption of the fragile biofilm. Biofilm inhibition assay Prepare working solutions of antimicrobials (either antifungal drugs or essential oils) at minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) with proper solubilizing agents (0.2% Tween-80 is suitable for essential oils).In a new 24-well plate (plate 2), add 500 μL of YPD medium supplemented with 10% FBS to every well except the first. To the first well, add 1,000 μL of antimicrobial working solution (from C, step 1), followed by a serial dilution (in YPD medium supplemented with 10% FBS) to lower concentrations (e.g., 1/16 MIC) along the rows of the plate (Table 1, Day 4).Note: Washable test tubes (less expensive) can be used to serially dilute the antifungal drugs.",
    "Transfer drugs/plant-based essential oils (EOs) to the plate containing the pre-formed biofilm (plate 2 from step B), including a growth control and blank.If working with volatile antifungals (e.g., EOs), cover the plate with parafilm to avoid evaporation and incubate the plate at 37 °C for 24 h in the incubator without shaking (Figure 1).Biofilm visualization After 24 h, gently aspirate and discard the media from each well (Table 1, Day 5).Image samples at 4× with a stereomicroscope and capture images either with a digital camera or through the eyepiece using a cellphone camera. Representative images of C. albicans RSY150 biofilms exposed to various essential oil components are shown in Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4713/bioprotoc-13-13-4713-g002.jpgFigure 2. Stereoscopic brightfield images show visual differences between C. albicans RSY150 biofilm mass following exposure to rosemary essential oil, its components 1,8-cineole and α-pinene, Amp B (1/16 MIC to MIC), and the two components at 1/2 and 1 fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI), compared to control cells. Plates were imaged at 4× with the digital camera mounted on the stereomicroscope.Note: Assessment of biofilm formation and inhibition require experiments in triplicate, including controls, as there can be high variability in biofilm growth. Quantitative assays would require a microplate assay (Crystal violate/MTT/XTT). Many studies suggest 48 h incubation as optimal for biofilm studies (Chandra et al., 2001; Cruz et al., 2018; Ripolles-Avila et al., 2018; Cendra et al., 2019; Galdiero et al., 2020), but 24 h incubation does not require replacement of media as a result of nutrient depletion (Khelissa et al., 2017). FIC estimates the interaction between two or more drugs intended to be used in combination, and the FICI is calculated as the sum of FICs for compounds 1 and 2."
