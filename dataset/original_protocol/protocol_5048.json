    "Preparing the O-ring co-culture systemThe fibroblasts and prostate cancer cells should be maintained as separate cell lines, according to the supplier’s guidelines.Note: We maintained PC3 cells and fibroblasts in DMEM complete medium. The cells were passaged at 80-90% confluence and centrifuged at 300 x g.For the heterotypic co-culture system the fibroblasts and prostate cancer cells are removed from the culture dishes with trypsin/EDTA and centrifuged.The cell pellets are suspended in complete culture medium.A sterile O-ring is placed on top of glass coverslips in 24-well polystyrene culture dishes.Note: No silicone should be used to secure the O-ring to the coverslip since it would after affect the migration of the cells over the cell-free area. The O-ring simply sits on the cover slip; therefore care should be taken while transporting the microplate into the incubator.Fibroblasts (1.5 x 104 in 350 μl) are placed around the O-ring and prostate cancer cells (0.5 x 104 in 100 μl) are placed inside the O-ring, as represented in Figure 1.Note: Steps A1 to A7 must be carried out in a biosafety cabinet to ensure culture sterility and operator’s safety.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170212/20170212171604_1621.jpgFigure 1. O-ring co-culture technique. Fibroblasts are seeded around the O-ring and cancer cells are seeded inside the O-ring.The cells are maintained in culture with the O-rings for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2.The O-rings are then removed with a forceps and the cells are washed twice with complete medium to remove any cells that have not adhered, and then left in culture for a further 48 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Note: Upon the removal of the O-ring the investigator can ascertain the O-ring area is cell-free, which is an indication that there was no cross-contamination between cell lines.",
    "Over the next 24 h the two cell lines readily migrate into the cell-free area forming a zone containing both cell lines in direct contact.For immunocytochemistry the cells are fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde prepared in PBS after 24 or 48 h.Note: The investigators should monitor their cells under a microscope in order to determine the optimal time for fixing their specific cell types. We determined 24 h was optimal for most cells types. Immunofluorescence staining of the ECM moleculesThe cells are washed with PBS and incubated in blocking solution (5% FBS) for 1 h at room temperature.The cells are then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibodies used in our published work were: anti-collagen I (Calbiochem I-8H5 and Sigma COL1), anti-collagen IV (against α1 type IV) and two distinct anti-collagen V (Chemicon AB763P and Abcam Clone V-3 C9), rabbit anti-fibromodulin (Santa Cruz H-50), rabbit anti-biglycan (Santa Cruz H-150), mouse anti-fibronectin, goat anti-perlecan (Santa Cruz L-20), anti-versican (Santa Cruz H-56) and finally, mouse anti-smooth muscle α actin conjugated with Cy3 (clone 1A4).The coverslips are then washed three times for 15 min and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor® 488 or Alexa Fluor® 594.The coverslips are then washed with PBS three times, 15 min for each wash and mounted on glass slides in Fluoromount G (2:1 in PBS).Negative controls must be done for immunostaining experiments. These were done in our set of experiments by omitting the primary antibody. Coverslips are examined using scanning confocal inverted microscope (Zeiss LSM510) and fluorescence quantified using a LSM image browser."
