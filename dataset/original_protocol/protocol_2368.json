    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTissue preparation\nTiming: 1 h\nTissue is collected from the animal, snap frozen in O.C.T. using liquid nitrogen vapor, and stored at −80°C.\nSacrifice the animal by cervical dislocation.\nDissect and embed the tissue in O.C.T..\nCritical: Process the tissue quickly to avoid RNA degradation by the endogenous RNase.\nFloat a PCR tube rack on the surface of liquid nitrogen.\nPlace the O.C.T. embedded tissue block on the tube rack.\nWait until O.C.T. solidifies. The O.C.T. appears white after it solidifies.\nDrop the O.C.T. block into liquid nitrogen until there are no more bubbles.\nCritical: Do not directly drop the tissue into liquid nitrogen when O.C.T. is still in liquid form.\nStore the block at −80°C until use. The frozen sample can be stored up to a year.\nNote: This step is optional. The tissue block can be processed directly to the next step if the user chooses not to store the sample.\nTissue sectioning and fixation\nTiming: 4 h\nFrozen tissue is sectioned into 10 μm sections and mounted on slides. The tissue sections are fixed for long term storage.\nSection the tissue at 10 μm using a cryostat at −25°C.\nNote: The number of sections that can fit onto a single slide depends on the size of the tissue and the skill of the experimenter. For example, for sections 0.5 cm in length and width, 4–8 sections may be processed on one slide.\nDry slides at 100°C for 2 min and proceed directly to fixation.\nNote: To avoid drying of the solution in the following steps, the slides are processed in a humidifying chamber, a small plastic box with added water or wet Kimwipe at the bottom, as indicated in the Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nAdd water into the humidifying chamber.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2002-Fig3.jpg",
    "Figure 3. A schematic illustration of the step-by-step method details\nPlace the slides into the humid chamber. The slides should be elevated above the water at the bottom and leveled.\nFix slides in 4% PFA for 1 h at room temperature (18°C–25°C).\nWash slides 3× with PBS, 5 min each.\nWash slides with freshly prepared 1-methylimidazole buffer for 5 min.\nFix slides in EDC fixative for 1 h.\nWash slides with PBS for 5 min.\nCritical: PFA and EDC are toxic and should be handled and disposed of safely.\nOptional: Permeabilize slides in 100% methanol at room temperature (18°C–25°C) for 1 h. For eye tissue, this step improves probe penetration.\nRemove PBS.\nPause point: The slides can be store at −80°C after removing PBS. If methanol permeabilization is used, the tissue sections can be stored directly in methanol.\nYn-situ hybridization\nTiming: 1–2 days\nThis step is the core procedure for detection of RNA using Yn-situ. The target RNA first hybridizes with targeting probes. The preamplifier then hybridizes with targeting probe pairs that bind close to each other. Fluorescent signals are developed by HCR reaction in situ.\nAir dry the slides and draw a well around the tissue with ImmEdge hydrophobic barrier PAP pen.\nNote: The hydrophobic barrier should be complete dry before the next step to ensure its proper function (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nDigest the tissue with 10 μg/mL proteinase K in IDTE buffer for 10 min at 40°C.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2002-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Example images of  hydrophobic barriers",
    "100 μL of 0.04% trypan blue solution is applied to two slides (A and B). Solution is applied to (B) before the hydrophobic barrier is completely dried. Solid arrow indicates folding at the interface between the barrier and the solution, a sign of bad barrier formation. White arrowhead indicates the area where solution leaks out of the barrier.\nCritical: The optimal proteinase K concentration and digestion time need to be determined for different tissue type and age. High concentration of proteinase K results in the loss of tissue. Low concentration of proteinase K results in weak signals.\nWash slides with PBS for 5 min.\nWash slides with hybridization solution for 5 min.\nPrepare probe mixture (4 pmol per probe) by adding 2 μL of each of the odd and even probes (2 μM stock solution) into 1 mL hybridization buffer.\nHybridize sections with probe mixture at 40°C, overnight (12–18 h). See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: problems 6 and 7.\nRemove probe mixture by flicking the slide to shake the droplet off.\nWash slides in probe wash buffer, 4 × for 30 min each, at 40°C.\nWash slides in 5× SSCT for 5 min, 3 times at room temperature (18°C–25°C).\nWash slides in hybridization buffer for 5 min at room temperature (18°C–25°C).\nAdd 5 μL preamplifier (20 ng/μL) into 500 μL probe hybridization buffer (final concentration 0.2 ng/μL).\nIncubate sections with preamplifier for 5 h, 40°C.\nNote: This step can be shortened if the user wants to check whether a new probe can produce signals. A minimum of 2 h is required to produce visible signals.\nWash slides in probe wash buffer for 30 min at 40°C.\nEquilibrate sections in amplification buffer for 5 min at room temperature (18°C–25°C).",
    "Anneal 2 μL of each HCR Hairpins (3 μM) in separate tubes in a thermocycler, start at 95°C for 90 s, decrease temperature 2°C/min for 35 min until the temperature reaches 25°C.\nCritical: The two HCR hairpins need to be annealed separately.\nAdd both annealed hairpins into 100 μL amplification buffer (1:50 dilution).\nNote: A minimum of 30 μL of diluted hairpin solution is required for one slide. For hairpin annealing, we do not recommend volume below 2 μL to avoid problem caused by evaporation in the thermocycler. The 100 μL diluted working solution prepared here from the 2 μL of stock solution is sufficient for 3 slides. If the user has more than 3 slides, the amount used need to be scaled up accordingly.\nIncubate sections in hairpin solutions overnight (12–18 h), in the dark, at room temperature (18°C–25°C).\nCritical: The incubation should be performed in dark.\nWash slides in 5× SSCT for 5 min, 3 times.\nMount the coverslip with ProLong gold antifade mounting media.\nPause point: the slides can be stored at 4°C for a month before imaging.\nImaging\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step is for imaging the samples prepared in the above steps. We will provide general guidance for this process, not specific parameters because the users likely have different microscopes and the specific optics, lasers, age of the microscopes will influence how the parameters are determined.\nView the signals under an epifluorescence microscope with a low magnification lens (any 10× or 20× lens) and locate the cells of interest to image. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: problems 8–11.\nImage the slides with a confocal microscope using a high magnification lens (Plan-Apochromat 40×/1.4 Oil DIC M27 or Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 Oil DIC M27 for Zeiss microscopes, and HC PL APO 100×/1,40 OIL STED WHITE for Leica microscopes).",
    "Note: Empirically determine the laser power to avoid photobleaching. Take Z-stack images that cover the entire cell of interest. Use a Z step distance that is half of the z resolution. Save both individual z images and the maximal intensity projection image. When multiple areas need to be imaged, use a tile scan to generate a larger image.\nNote: We have used a Leica SP8 confocal microscope with HyVolution (Borlinghaus and Kappel, 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) and a Zeiss 780 confocal microscope when super resolution imaging is not performed. We encourage the users to use super resolution imaging when the density of the puncta within the cell of interest is too high to be resolved by regular confocal microscope.\nCritical: To facilitate quantification of foci, the user should acquire the image with sufficient resolution. This can be achieved by zooming into individual punctum and counting the number of pixels contained by the punctum. Users should avoid using the resolution below 5 pixels/μm as it is hard to distinguish individual puncta under this resolution (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nNote: The intensities of the brightest and weakest puncta should be within the detection range of the sensor. The users should avoid overexposing and underexposing the signals regardless of the microscope being used. In most modern fluorescent microscopes, histograms of the pixel intensities are plotted. One can adjust system gain, background threshold, and laser power to set a dynamic range that has the pixel intensity to be well distributed with few pixels beyond this range. Some software, such as Zeiss Zen, has a “range indicator” to show overexposed and underexposed pixels.\nExport the images as tiff files for analysis.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2002-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.
