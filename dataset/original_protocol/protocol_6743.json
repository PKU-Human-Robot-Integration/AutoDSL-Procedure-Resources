    "Starting MDCK II cell culturePrepare the complete medium for MDCK II cells (see Recipes).Thaw a vial with frozen MDCK II cells.Transfer the cells into a 15 ml Falcon tube containing the complete medium.Centrifuge the cells for 5 min at 1,500 rpm (214 × g).Discard the supernatant.Add 10 ml of complete medium. Pipette up and down.Transfer the cells into a cell culture dish.Culture cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in cell culture incubator.MDCK II cell passagePre-warm complete medium and trypsin.Remove medium from the cells.Wash with 10 ml of DPBS.Add 2 ml of trypsin.Incubate cells for 5 min at 37 °C.Check under the microscope if cells are detached.Note: If cells are not detached, continue incubation for 2-5 min at 37 °C. Add 10 ml of complete medium.Pipette up and down.Transfer the cell suspension into a 15 ml tube.Centrifuge the cells for 5 min at 1,500 rpm (214 × g).Discard the supernatant.Seed the cells in a new cell culture dish. Use split ratio of 1:5.Culture cells at 37 °C.Induction of EMTDay 0 Seed 16,000 cells/well in an 8-well chamber slide.Note: For the induction of EMT in MDCK II cells, the cells were passaged less than 10 times. Incubate cells overnight.Day 1 Prepare HGF stock 100 μg/ml and make aliquots:Spin down the vial with lyophilized HGF.Add 250 μl of sterile BSA 1 mg/ml (in PBS) to the vial with HGF.Mix by pipetting.Spin down.Make aliquots. Use sterile 1.5 ml tubes.Store the aliquots at -80 °C.Dilute the HGF stock with complete medium to final concentration 20 ng/ml. Mix by vortexing.Remove medium from the cells, that were seeded in the 8-well chamber slide.Add 0.5 ml of DPBS per well.Remove DPBS.Add complete medium containing HGF, use 0.5 ml medium per well.Note: For the control, treat cells with complete medium without HGF.",
    "Incubate the cells for 24 h at 37 °C.Immunofluorescent staining and imagingDay 2 Thaw:3% PFA (see Recipes)Goat serum5% saponin (see Recipes)Prepare:Washing Buffer (see Recipes)Blocking Buffer (see Recipes)Remove culture medium.Fix the cultures in 3% PFA for 10-15 min. Use 0.5 ml of PFA/well.Note: All immunostaining steps are performed at room temperature, except where otherwise provided. Wash the cultures with PBS 1× (see Recipes). Use 0.5 ml of PBS 1×/well.Add 0.5 ml of Blocking Buffer/well. Incubate for 1 h at room temperature.Incubate the cultures with primary antibodies (Table 1), overnight, at 4 °C. Cover the cultures with parafilm.Dilute anti-ZO-1 antibody at a ratio 1:200.Dilute anti-vimentin antibody at a ratio 1:500.Use Washing Buffer for dilution of antibodies.Use minimum 200 μl antibody solution/well.Day 3 Remove antibody solution.Wash with PBS 1×. Use 0.5 ml of PBS 1×/well.Incubate the cultures with fluorescent secondary antibodies (Table 2) for 1 h.Dilute secondary antibodies at a ratio 1:500.Use Washing Buffer for dilution of antibodies.Use minimum 200 μl antibody solution/well.Cover the cultures with aluminium foil to protect from the light.Wash with PBS 1×. Use 0.5 ml of PBS 1x/well.Discard PBS 1×.Remove media chamber. Use removing device.MountingPut few drops of mounting medium on a coverslip slide.Put the coverslip slide on the top of the slide containing the cultures. Avoid bubbles.Seal the mounted slide with nail polish.Store the slides in a microscope slide folder at 4 °C. Protect from light.Day 4 Take images of the stained cells with a confocal microscope (Figure 1)."
