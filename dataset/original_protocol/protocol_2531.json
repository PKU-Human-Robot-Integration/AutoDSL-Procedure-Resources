Remove the ethanol and allow the beads to air dry.\nElute the DNA by adding 27 μL of water to the beads, mixing thoroughly. Incubate the sample for 2 min at 25°C.\nPlace the sample back onto the magnetic rack to separate beads for 1 min. Transfer 25 μL of the eluted DNA to a clean 1.5 mL tube.\nRun the final PCRs on 8% non-denaturing TBE polyacrylamide mini gels at 200 V for 50 min in 0.5× TBE.\nRemove the gel from the plate and stain by covering in 15 mL of 0.5× TBE plus 2 μL of SYBR Gold.\nIncubate at 25°C on a rocking platform for 5 min.\nVisualize under blue light.\nNote: An example final PCR gel is shown in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7].\nCritical: The use of blue light illumination is necessary to prevent DNA damage that can result from UV illumination.\nExcise the library products with a razor blade and place gel slices into two 1.5 mL tubes containing 750 μL of DNA elution buffer.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2163-Fig7.jpg",
    "Figure 7. Final library PCRs\nRepresentative 8% TBE polyacrylamide gel of final PCR products. Library bands indicated by the black dashed box were excised and purified to avoid contamination from primers and undesired PCR products above and below these bands.\nIncubate on a rotator for 12–14 h at 25°C.\nTransfer eluted DNA solution to new 1.5 mL tubes.\nAdd 750 μL of isopropanol and 2 μL of Glycoblue to each tube. Vortex the sample and incubate at −20°C for at least 30 min.\nCentrifuge at 21,000 × g at 4°C for 30 min to pellet DNA.\nWash pellets twice with 1 mL of 80% ethanol and centrifuge at 21,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min. Remove supernatant and air-dry pellets at 25°C for 5 min.\nResuspend the DNA library in 10 μL of water.\nRun 1 μL of each sample on an Agilent Bioanalyzer using a High Sensitivity DNA chip to determine the library size distribution.\nNote: A successful library preparation should yield a single dominant peak of the appropriate size. An example size distribution is shown in Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8].\nPool the samples into a single multiplexed library at a final concentration of 1–2 nM each.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2163-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Bioanalyzer quality confirmation of DART libraries\nSize-selected libraries analyzed on a Bioanalyzer using a High Sensitivity DNA chip. A sharp peak corresponding to the desired library size indicates a successful library preparation.\nNote: To obtain sufficient coverage for a 12,000-sequence pool, we used one lane of Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer to obtain 150 million 75 bp paired end reads."
