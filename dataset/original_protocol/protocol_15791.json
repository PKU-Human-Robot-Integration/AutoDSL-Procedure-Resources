    "All experimental procedures in this study were performed in accordance with German and European Union guidelines and were approved by the institutional animal care committee and the government of upper Bavaria (Regierung von Oberbayern). Only male C57Bl6 mice between the ages of 8-10 weeks were used for the experiments.\n1. Preparation of the mouse brain (~ 15 min per mouse)\nPrepare the dissection medium by adding 5 mL of 1 M HEPES (final concentration 10 mM) to 500 mL of 1x Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS).\n\tNOTE: The storage time of the dissection medium (+4 °C) should not exceed 2 weeks.\nSacrifice the mice by cervical dislocation and carefully dissect the brain.\n\tNOTE: When investigating the ECM, the tissue should preferably be unmodified. Cervical dislocation keeps dissection time as short as possible, thereby preventing post-mortal enzymatic autodigestion as much as possible. If removal of blood is critical to the research question, simply perfuse the mouse transcardially with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before removing the brain.\nExtract the brain by manual dissection and place it in a culture dish containing ice-cold dissection medium (Figure 1B - 1).\n\tNOTE: Keep the brains in dissection medium on ice throughout the dissection.\nRemove the olfactory bulb (OB) with a scalpel (Figure 1B - 2) by a straight coronal cut between the OB and the anterior pole of the cortex.\nRemove the anterior pole of the cortex with the scalpel using a coronal cut to make the lateral ventricles visible in the coronal plane (Figure 1B - 3).\n\tNOTE: Make sure the coronal cut is made ~5 mm rostrally from the optic chiasm; otherwise, the rostral part of the SEZ/MEZ will be lost.",
    "Using scissors, open both lateral ventricles from the top, starting with a sagittal section from the cortical surface to the ventricular lumen, and elongate this cut in a c-shaped manner following the ventricular flexion (Figure 1B - 4).\nConnect the caudal ends of the left and right sagittal incision by means of an additional coronal cut with the scissors.\n\tNOTE: The three cuts now form a trapezoid and will facilitate the removal of the cortex and corpus callosum in the next step.\nRemove the cortex and corpus callosum covering the lateral ventricles using forceps (Figure 1B - 5). Then, remove the cortex and corpus callosum that cover the medial ventricular walls. Here, make additional cuts if the tissue is attached to the medial ventricular walls, or simply lift the cortex and corpus callosum with scissors to dislodge the tissue.\nCarefully spread the ventricular walls with forceps (Figure 1B - 6). Remove the choroid plexus with forceps.\n\tNOTE: Complete removal of the choroid plexus is important to avoid interference with the following dissection steps and avoid potential contamination of the SEZ/MEZ samples.\nPut the brain on a glass slide and place the glass slide on top of dry ice to freeze the brain. Maintain the ventricular walls in the open configuration.\n\tNOTE: Ensure enough distance between the lateral and medial walls of the ventricle to facilitate precise and exclusive dissection of SEZ and MEZ. If the tissue contracts back into a closed configuration, use the forceps to fix the walls in the desired position during freezing. Avoid any damage to the SEZ/MEZ. Try applying minimal force, mainly at the top edge of the opened ventricles.\n2. Sectioning of the prepared brain (~ 15 min per mouse)",
    "Cut 50-100 µm thick coronal sections of the brain until the end of the lateral ventricle using a cryostat and mount the sections onto glass slides. Ensure that the brain is attached to the cryostat attachment plate at the hindbrain with OCT medium and that no OCT comes in contact with the forebrain, especially at the ventricles.\n\tNOTE: OCT medium will interfere with MS measurements. However, if the tissue will be used for an antibody assay, it is unnecessary to exclude OCT medium. The use of coated glass slides is not recommended. Coated slides apply too much adhesive force on the tissue, thereby impeding the translocation of the tissue specimen from the slides into the microcentrifuge tube in the following steps.\n3. Free-hand dissection of brain slices (~ 30 min per mouse)\nPlace the glass slides with the brain sections on dry ice under a dissection microscope (Figure 1C - 1).\nPrepare the microcentrifuge tubes on dry ice, and ensure that the tubes stay on dry ice for at least 1 min to be sufficiently cold before specimen transfer.\n\tNOTE: Use microcentrifuge tubes of high quality, as some low-quality tubes may shed plastic in the subsequent tissue digestion steps associated with MS measurements.\nLift the slices from the dry ice for 15-30 s to achieve a brief, incomplete thawing to render the compact myelin of the striatum observable as dense white dots.\n\tNOTE: Locating the border between the SEZ and the striatum becomes feasible (Figure 1C - 2, see Figure 2A for the exclusion of myelin and a comparison with the wholemount method). If thawing takes too long, the process can be accelerated by pressing a glove-covered finger onto the opposite side of the glass slide. However, this maneuver should be practiced as excessive thawing occurs easily.",
    "Separate the SEZ with a precooled scalpel from the adjacent striatum (Figure 1C,D).\nTransfer the SEZ either as a whole piece or sectioned into 2-4 parts into a microcentrifuge tube by using the blunt edge of the cooled scalpel. If the tissue is to be used for another type of analysis other than MS, transfer the tissue specimen into the appropriate container instead (e.g., a 96-well plate).\n\tNOTE: Cutting the completely frozen tissue may lead to tissue rapidly breaking away and falling off the slide. Cutting completely thawed tissue leads to the disintegration of the tissue. Ensure that the tissue is neither completely frozen nor completely thawed."
