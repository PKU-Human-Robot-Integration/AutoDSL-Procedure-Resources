    "1. Construct and Reporter Plasmid Preparation\nPCR amplify the promoter regions / \"fragments\" (preferably ~250 - 500 bp) of the target DNA to be analyzed for further cloning into the entry vector using E. coli (TOP10).\nUpon sequencing confirmation, subclone the positive clone in a compatible pGLacZi expression vector 7 as previously described 8,9,10,11.\nTransform the yeast strain for promoter integration (YM4271) by homologous recombination of pGLacZi to generate yeast reporter strain as described earlier 12,13. The transformation and confirmation steps of the yeast strain with the DNA region along with the recipe of the media is not described here, as the steps are similar to classical Y1H protocol 9,10,11,12,13. The pEXP-AD502 control plasmid can be used for normalization purposes while quantifiying β-galactosidase activity as previously described 8.\nClone the TF or protein of interest and subsequently clone the interacting protein partner into pDEST22 and pDEST32ΔDBD (pDEST32 minus DNA Binding Domain) expression vectors. The transformed yeast promoter fragments and the TF clones are subsequently used further in the protocol.\n2. Modified Y1.5H Protocol\nOn day 1 (afternoon), start with 5 mL of culture in SD-Ura from a Petri dish or glycerol stock and incubate overnight in a 30 °C shaker.\n\tNOTE: This culture can be started from a freshly streaked plate or directly from a 25% or 30% glycerol stock of the yeast clone with the DNA fragment.\nOn day 2 (afternoon), inoculate 10 mL of YPDA media with 500 μL of the overnight culture and incubate overnight in a 30 °C shaker.\nDay 3 (early in the morning and whole afternoon): Prepare competent cells (early in the morning).",
    "Inoculate 100 mL of YPDA media with the 2 mL of the overnight culture and incubate in a 30 °C shaker. Grow this fresh culture until the OD600 reaches 0.4-0.8 (3-5 h).\n\t\tNOTE: Check the OD600 of the overnight culture and make sure that the start point OD600 for this step is 0.1 - 0.2. Use of over- or under-grown culture may prolong the experiment.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 1000 x g and 21 °C. Discard the supernatant.\nReconstitute pellets in 10 mL of sterile water using a vortex or pipetting up and down.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 1000 x g and 21 °C. Discard the supernatant.\nReconstitute pellets in 2 mL of Tris-Ethylenediaminetetraaceticacid (TE)/ Lithium acetate (LiAc) using a vortex or pipetting up and down.\n\t\tNOTE: Please see the recipe for TE/LiAc in Table 1.\nCentrifuge for 5 min 1000 x g and 21°C. Discard the supernatant.\nRe-suspend pellet in 4 mL of TE/LiAc + 400 μL of salmon sperm DNA (10 mg/mL) pipetting up and down and proceed to the next step.\nCo-transformation: Heat shock the cells (late in the afternoon)\nDistribute 20 μL of cells per well in a 96-well mixing plate (U-bottom).\nAdd 150 ng (~1.5 µL) each of the pDEST22: TF plasmid, pDEST32ΔDBD: TF plasmid and pEXP-AD502 plus pDEST32ΔDBD: TF (normalization control) to the wells.\n\t\tNOTE: Optimum results are expected with ~150 ng each of pDEST22: TF and pDEST32ΔDBD: TF plasmid for successful co-transformation. Can vary with construct and plasmid expressions, thus need to be optimized with every experiment. Another control pDEST22-TF plus pDEST32deltaDBD can also be included at user’s discretion.\nAdd 100 µL of TE/ LiAc / polyethylene glycol (PEG) per well (mix three times).\n\t\tNOTE: Please see the recipe for TE/LiAc/PEG in Table 1.",
    "Cover the plate with a breathable seal and incubate for 20 - 30 min (can be longer) at 30 °C (no agitation necessary).\nHeat shock for 20 min (precisely) at 42 °C.\nPlate the cells.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 1000 x g and 21 °C. Remove supernatant using a multichannel pipette. Add 110 μL of TE and mix.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 1000 x g and 21 °C. Remove 100 μL of the supernatant using a multichannel pipette. Re-suspend the pellet with the puncher.\nTransfer cells on SD-Trp-Leu agar plates. Incubate plates at 30 °C until next step.\nDay 5 (afternoon): Transfer the cells on new plates using puncher/microplate replicator.\nFill a sterile 96-well mixing plate (U-bottom) with 50 μL of TE using a multichannel pipette. Pre-wet the puncher in TE.\n\t\tNOTE: The puncher or the microplate replicator should be sterilized before this step and subsequently later in the protocol. The common way of sterilizing puncher such as immersing it in ethanol (100%; not molecular biology grade) and then burning it to the flame can be applied. Wait for 1 min to cool-off the puncher pins.\nCaution: If performing the sterilization on the bench; make sure bench is pre-cleaned with ethanol and free of any combustible material around. Wear proper personal protective equipment (PPE).\nPunch colonies and re-suspend in TE-filled plate.\n\t\tNOTE: If there is a smooth growth on the plate, colonies can be punched directly to the TE-filled plate or alternatively, single colony (in case of multiple colonies) should be picked using a sterilized toothpick to the TE filled plate and subsequently puncher can be used for the next step.\nTransfer them on new SD-Trp-Leu agar plates for optimal surface coverage. Incubate plates at 30 °C until the next step.",
    "Day 7 (afternoon): Start culture to measure β-galactosidase activity.\nFill a sterile 96-well mixing plate (U-bottom) with 50 μL of SD-Trp-Leu media using a multichannel pipette.\nFill a sterile 96-deep well block with 180 μL of SD-Trp-Leu media using a multichannel pipette.\nPre-wet the puncher in media and transfer colonies from plate to the 50 μL of media.\nTransfer 20 μL of yeast to the 180 μL of SD-Trp-Leu media and seal the block with a breathable seal. Incubate for 36 h at 30 °C shaker.\nDay 9 (morning): Start the culture for enzymatic measurement.\nTransfer 100 μL of culture to 500 μL of YPDA media in a sterilized 96 deep well block.\nCover the sterilized deep well plate with a breathable seal and incubate for 3 - 5 h at 30 °C with agitation at 200 rpm (until OD600 0.3-0.6).\nRe-suspend culture and transfer 125 μL using a multichannel pipette on a spectrophotometer plate (measure OD600).\n\t\tNOTE: Caution: Do not dispense the last drop to avoid bubbles, if the OD600 is below 0.3 - 0.6, incubate the remaining cells for 1 - 2 h more based on the reading. The 125 μL culture used at this step can be discarded or transferred back to the original deep well block at user's discretion.\nCentrifuge the remaining cells in the deep well block for 10 min at 3000 x g and 21 °C. Remove supernatant by inverting.\nAdd 200 μL of Z-buffer and vortex.\n\t\tNOTE: Please see the recipe for Z-buffer in Table 1.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 3000 x g and 21 °C. Remove supernatant by inverting.\nAdd 20 μL Z-buffer and vortex.",
    "Cover the plate with sealing foil that can resist freeze thaw cycles. Perform 4 cycles of freeze/thaw using liquid nitrogen in a fume hood and then 42 ºC in a water bath (2 min each).\nAdd 200 μL Z-buffer/beta-mercaptoethanol (β-ME)/Ortho-nitrophenyl-β-galactoside (ONPG) (12 mL, 21 μL, 8.4 mg respectively will yield 20 mL solution; always prepare fresh).\n\t\tNOTE: ONPG will take some time to dissolve properly so prepare the solution an hour before reaching this step. ONPG serves as the substrate for measurement of β-galactosidase activity.\nIncubate up to 17 - 24 h at 30 °C (check in between, if color develops earlier proceed to the next step).\nDay 10 (morning): Stop the reaction and measure.\nAdd 110 μL 1M Na2CO3 to stop the reaction and record time.\nVortex and centrifuge for 10 min at 3000 x g and 21 °C.\nTake 125 μL of supernatant using multichannel and measure OD420.\n\t\tNOTE: Caution, do not dispense the last drop to avoid bubbles.\nCalculate β-gal activity: 1000 x OD420 / (time (min) x volume (mL) x OD600 in a spreadsheet.\nSubscription Required.
