    "1. Microbial cell culture\nRevivify cells from a glycerol stock.\n\tNOTE: C. albicans are stored at -80 °C in glycerol stocks, on marbles.\n\t\nPick a marble in the -80 °C stock and rub it on yeast peptone dextrose (YPD) agar. Grow the cells for 2 days at 30 °C, before liquid cultivation.\nPrepare liquid cultures.\n\t\nFill a culture tube with 5 mL of sterile YPD broth and add a single colony of C. albicans cells, grown on the YPD agar plate.\nGrow the culture in static conditions at 30 °C for 20 h before harvesting by centrifugation (4000 x g, 5 min). Discard the supernatant and eliminate as biohazard waste.\nWash the pellets 2x with 10 mL of acetate buffer (8 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MnCl2, pH 5.2). Centrifuge (4000 x g, 5 min) in between washings.\nResuspend the pellet in 2 mL of acetate buffer and use this solution for cell immobilization on the PDMS stamp.\n\t\tNOTE: This suspension cannot be stored and should be prepared fresh for section 3.\n2. PDMS stamp preparation\nSilicon master mold preparation\n\t\nDraw the desired microstructures using computer assisted design (CAD) software.\n\t\tNOTE: The wells designed should be of similar size to the microbe to trap. The design should provide a large matrix of wells 100 x 100 at list. It is best to make several arrays with slightly different sizes around the average size of the microbe.\nIf a clean room is available, follow steps 2 to 12 of the previously published protocol12. Otherwise, silicon master mold can be acquired from commercial clean room facilities.\nPDMS stamp molding\n\t\nPrepare 55 g of PDMS prepolymer solution containing a mixture of 10 to 1, mass ratio, of PDMS oligomers and curing agent (Table of Materials).",
    "Mix and degas this solution under vacuum (in the range of 10-1-10-2 bars) until all trapped bubbles are removed from the PDMS solution (5−10 min).\nPour 20 g of the degassed solution on the silicon master mold and degas again (in the range of 10-1-10-2 bars).\n\t\tNOTE: The stamp thickness should be around 2−3 mm.\nWhen all bubbles are removed, reticulate the PDMS at 80 °C during 1 h.\nCut the PDMS microstructured stamp with a scalpel (0.5 x 1.5 cm2) in a direction parallel to the visible microstructure arrays.\nPeel the stamp from the silicon master mold.\nReturn the stamp to exhibit the microstructures on its upper side and deposit it on a glass slide. Make sure to have the microstructures facing up away from the glass slide. Align the microstructures that can be seen on the stamp with the side of the glass slide, which will later serve as a reference for the AFM automation procedure.\n\t\tNOTE: At this stage, the PDMS stamp is ready for cell immobilization. The PDMS stamps can be stored on the silicon master mold for several months. When all the PDMS is removed from the master mold, a new PDMS stamp can be casted again on the master mold (to keep the master mold safe, it is possible to replicate it in polyurethane)14.\n3. Sample preparation\nCell immobilization\n\t\nCentrifuge (500 x g, 5 min) 600 µL of the resuspended cell solution to separate the buffer from the cells.\nPipet 200 µL of the supernatant from step 3.1.1 onto the PDMS stamp, and degas under vacuum (in the range of 10-1-10-2 bars) for about 40 min.",
    "NOTE: This step is important to improve the cell immobilization inside the wells. Molecules from the yeast cell wall, present in the supernatant, are probably deposited on the PDMS surface during this pre-wetting step. These molecules, most probably, enhance the adhesion of the cells and contribute to the increase in the stamp filling rate.\nAfter 40 min, with a pipette, remove the buffer from the PDMS surface and deposit, with a pipette, 200 µL of the cell solution from step 1.2.4 for 15 min at room temperature.\nPlace the cells into the microstructures of the stamp by convective/capillary assembly. For that, manually spread 200 µL of cells suspension across the stamp using a glass slide in both directions with an angle between 30 and 50°. It may be necessary to pass the glass slide several times on the stamp to achieve a high filling rate.\n\t\tNOTE: A full description of this method is available13.\nRemove the cell suspension with a pipette. Wash the stamp 3x with 1 mL of acetate buffer, pH 5.2 to remove the cells that were not trapped.\nDry the back of the stamp using nitrogen flow, in order to ensure that the stamp will adhere to the dry Petri dish.\nFinally deposit the PDMS stamp filled with cells in a Petri dish (Table of Materials) and fill it with 2 mL of acetate buffer to maintain the cells in liquid medium.\nSetting the stamp on the AFM stage\n\t\nCenter the stage at 0:0 when starting AFM operations.\nCalibrate sensitivity and spring constant of the cantilever on glass and in water as described in Unsay et al.15\nTake the Petri dish with the stamp and place it in the AFM Petri dish holder.\nAlign the stamp edge perpendicular to the Petri dish holder Y axis.",
    "NOTE: An acceptable tilt angle is under 5° as illustrated in Figure 1.\nPlace the AFM head onto the stage and be careful that the stepper motors are sufficiently extended to avoid the tip to crash on the stamp.\n4. Running the AFM program\nNOTE: The AFM program is provided as a Supplementary Material (AutomatipSoftware2019.pdf). It requires a JPK-Bruker AFM Nanowizard II or III equipped with a motorized stage and JPK desktop software version 4.3. The program has been developed under Jython (version based on python 2.7)\nData acquisition\n\t\nCenter the AFM tip on top of the left corner of the 4.5 x 4.5 µm2 wells (corresponding to the cell size) using the AFM optical microscope. If another well size is needed, center on top left corner of the desired wells.\nPerform a 64 x 64 force map (Z range = 4 µm, tip velocity = 90 µm·s-1, applied force 3 to 5 nN) over a 100 x 100 µm² area. Select Force Mapping mode from the Measurement mode drop-down box. In the force control mapping panel input the following parameters: Rel. Setpoint = 3 to 5 nN; z length 4 µm; Z movement: constant duration; extend time: 0.01s; ext. delay:0; Retr delay: 0, Delay mode: Constant Force, Sample rate 2048 Hz; Z closed loop uncheck; Grid: check Square image, Fast 100 µm, slow: 100µm, X offset: 0 µm; Y offset: 0 µm; grid angle: 0 degree; Pixels: 64x64; pixel ratio: 1:1\n\t\tNOTE: A typical result is shown in Figure 2. This image will help measure and verify the pitch between two wells.",
    "Note the coordinates of the center of the top left well (W1) and of the bottom left well (referred as W2 on Figure 2). To do so, make a square box around the well. The coordinate of the center of the box appears on the left panel of the AFM software in x,y coordinates boxes.\nTo open the automation software (Automatip_scan.py): in the JPK desktop software click on advance in the top bar menu and select open the script. In the window that opens select the path toward the script file provided in Supplementary Data (Automatip_scan.py).\nImplement W1 and W2 coordinate values in the Inputs box section of the Jython script (Figure 3). Input the W1 coordinates in the P1 variable line 239 of the script and the W2 coordinates in the P2 variable line 241.\n\t\tNOTE: The wells selected as initial coordinates (W1 and W2) should not be too close from the scanning area edge. Otherwise the centering algorithm would not execute correctly because it needs to measure the height on the PDMS surface on each side of the well. For an example, see Figure 4.\nAttribute the pitch value to the pitch variable line 245 of the script.\nInput the well dimension in the Ws variable line 248. This is known from the design of the well patterns and can be checked on the same image as the one used to verify the pitch (Figure 2).\nWrite the path to the saving directory in line 251 to save the data at the desired place.",
    "Set the totalArea variable line 254 to the desire multiple \"n\" of 100 µm (that is the maximum scan area of the AFM used). The total number of wells that will be probed can be calculated using this value and the pitch: maximum scan area/pitch*n2.\n\t\tNOTE: In the example of Figure 3, 9 areas of 100 x 100 µm2 will be analyzed.\nSet the force curves matrix, row and column (3, 3 or 4, 4), recorded per well in the numScans variable line 257.\n\t\tNOTE: In the example of Figure 3, a matrix of 3 x 3 = 9 FCs will be recorded for each well.\nRun the program. Click on the Start button.",
    "NOTE: The program first automatically executes a centering algorithm to better determine the center of W1 and W2 wells (step 1). It then automatically acquires the Force Curves (FCs) matrix on each well of the first scanning area (step 2). When all the wells of that area are probed, the script automatically moves the AFM tip to the first well of the next scanning area. The tip is retracted, the microscope stage moves to the next area, the tip is again approached on the stamp and the centering algorithm is executed again to re-center automatically on the first well (1') of that area (step 3). The first area is defined by the user, the second one, is on the right etc. until n is reached. n+1 area is underneath n, n+2 on the left of n+1, etc. until 2n is reached. 2n+1 is underneath 2n, and 2n+2 is on the right on 2n, etc. Globally, the tip serpentines through the total area. Step 2 and 3 are repeated automatically until the total number \"n2\" of scanning areas have been probed. Figure 5 presents the flowchart of the program. It takes ~4 h to complete the program.\nData analysis\n\t\nExecute the \"Copy files\" python script (Copy_files_L.py, provided in Supplementary Data) to organize the FCs files into one folder. This script was developed with Python 2.7 and the SciPy module. Use Visual Studio Code software to open the python script. Input path to the general folder (line 67 of the script provided in supplementary data) and where it will be stored (line 73).\nOpen the AFM manufacturer data processing software to analyze the force curves. In the top menu File, select open ‘batch of spectroscopy curves.",
    "In the batch processing window, select the process provided in Supplementary Data (StiffnessProcess.jpk-proc-force). Select the last step of the process and click on Keep and Apply to All. All force curves will receive the same treatment.\n\t\tNOTE: The process uses the calibration from the FCs files to convert the deflection curves into force curves calibrated in Newton; a data smoothing algorithm is applied (average of 3 consecutives points); the baseline is translated to rest on the zero axis; the contact point is extrapolated and the FC is offset to place the contact point at coordinate (0,0); the bending of the cantilever is subtracted to the FCs, the retract slope is fitted. At the end of the data treatment, the software generates a file that contains a table giving for each FCs: its name, Young Modulus, contact point, adhesion force, slopes, etc.\nRepeat steps 4.2.1 to 4.2.3 for all experiments. Be careful to save the data in different folders (i.e.: “…\\TREATED\\” and “…\\UNTREATED\\”)\nUse the R script provided in Supplementary Data to plot histograms and box plots and perform ANOVA statistical treatments.\n\t\t\nTo open the R script (DataAnalisys.R), use R studio software and load the files containing the information extracted with the data processing software (.tsv).\nOn the environment window use the Import Dataset button, from the list displayed select from text (readr) and in the new window select the Browser button and find the .tsv file.\nOnce the file has loaded, select the columns (stiffness and adhesion) to be included for the analysis. To run all the code, press Ctrl+Alt+R.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The script works with 4 datasets, consider two experiments both having untreated and treated cells. It is possible to execute blocks of the script and see how the variables change according to the functions executed.",
