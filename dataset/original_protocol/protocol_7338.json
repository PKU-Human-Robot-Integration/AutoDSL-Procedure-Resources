    "Gene cloningClone the Sorghum bicolor CPR2c gene (Sobic.006G245400) with a N-terminal 6×His tag and without the native N-terminal hydrophobic membrane–anchoring region (Δ1–50) into vector pET-30a(+) for overexpression.Cell transformationPut E. coli Rosetta 2 (DE3) competent cells on ice.Add 1 μL of plasmid (20 ng/μL) into 20 μL of competent cells.Incubate on ice for 5 min.Heat shock for 30 s.Incubate on ice for 2 min.Add 80 μL of LB medium to competent cells.Shake at 37 °C at 220 rpm for 1 h.Plate all the cells on an LB agar plate with 50 ng/μL of kanamycin and incubate overnight.Protein expressionPick a single colony from the LB agar plate and grow in 5 mL of LB medium supplemented with 50 ng/μL kanamycin overnight at 37 °C.Grow 20 mL of starting culture from the 5 mL culture with 50 ng/μL kanamycin overnight at 37 °C.Transfer 20 mL of starting culture to 3 L of LB medium with 50 ng/μL kanamycin.Shake at 220 rpm and 37 °C until reaching a OD600 of 0.4–0.6.Cool down the medium to 25 °C and add 0.5 mM of IPTG to induce.Induce the cells at 25 °C for 16 h.Harvest the cells at 8,000 × g and 4 °C for 10 min.Protein purificationResuspend the cells with lysis buffer.Set the output control at 9 and duty cycle at 90%. Sonicate the cells for 30 s followed by resting on ice for 5 min until homogenous.Centrifuge at 34,000 × g and 4 °C for 1 h to remove the cell debris.Load the clear lysate on a gravity column containing 20 mL of nickel-NTA resin pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer.Wash with 200 mL of the same buffer.Elute the protein with 100 mL of elution buffer.",
    "Concentrate and buffer exchange against hydroxyapatite column buffer A using an Amicon 8050 ultrafiltration cell with a 30 kDa cutoff membrane.Load the buffer-exchanged protein on the hydroxyapatite column.Wash with 100 mL of 5% hydroxyapatite column buffer B.Elute protein with 10% hydroxyapatite column buffer B.Concentrate and buffer exchange against final buffer using an Amicon 8050 ultrafiltration cell with a 30 kDa cutoff membrane.Initial crystallization setupConcentrate the purified protein to 30 mg/mL, determined by the molar extinction coefficient of CPR (21.4 mm−1 cm−1).Add 1.2 mM of NADP+ prior to crystallization.Run Crystal Phoenix with an MRC 2-well crystallization plate with the index crystal screen kit and set up at room temperature (22 °C). The drop contains 0.2 μL of protein solution and 0.2 μL of screening solution.Small crystals show up in condition F12 (see crystallization buffer in Recipes) in two days (Figure 1A).Reproduce and optimize the crystal by mixing 1.6 μL of crystallization buffer, 2 μL of protein solution, and 0.4 μL of additive screen on a cover glass.Set up the hanging drop vapor diffusion in 24-well plates with 0.5 mL of crystallization buffer in reservoir.Needle-shaped crystals show up with additive screen condition 31 (1,5-diaminopentane dihydrochloride) in 3–5 days (Figure 1B).Crystal seedingMix 2.4 μL of crystallization buffer, 3 μL of protein solution, and 0.6 μL of additive screen.Suck one needle crystal from the previous drop, place into the new 6 μL crystallization drop, and set up the hanging drop.Large crystals show up in one week (Figure 1C).Transfer the cover glass to the reservoir filled with 0.5 mL of 30% (v/w), 40% (v/w), and 50% (v/w) PEG 3350 every third day for sequential dehydration.Fast freeze the dehydrated crystals in liquid nitrogen for X-ray diffraction after equilibrating in 50% (v/w) PEG 3350 for two days.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4546/bioprotoc-12-21-4546-g001.jpgFigure 1.

    "(A) Crystals obtained from the hit [index condition F12 (see crystallization buffer in Recipes)] of screening. (B) Crystals obtained from hanging drop with additive solution optimization. (C) Crystals obtained from seeding technique.Data collection and structure determinationDiffract the crystals at the beamline by using beam size 100 × 100 μm, 10 s, and 1 degree per frame and 180 degrees in total.Index, integrate, and scale the data using HKL2000.Do molecular replacement with the proper model [in our case, SbCPR2b (PDBID: 7SUX)] with PHENIX, run AutoBuild, and refine the structure with PHENIX and Coot.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4546/bioprotoc-12-21-4546-g002.jpgFigure 2. The resolution of the crystal has been improved from 11.7 Å (from non-seeding hanging drop crystals) to 4.5 Å (seeding crystals)"
