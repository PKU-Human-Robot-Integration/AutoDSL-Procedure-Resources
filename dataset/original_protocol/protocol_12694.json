    "1. Cell culture and drug treatment in the human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cell line\nPrepare culture medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% 2 mM L-glutamine, and 100 units/mL penicillin-streptomycin.\nSeed 1 x 106 cells in a 60 mm plate or a 6-well plate per treatment condition plus control.\nThe next day, treat the cells with DPC inducers of choice.\n\t\nTo induce TOP1-DPCs and their ubiquitylation and SUMOylation, add the TOP1 inhibitor camptothecin at 20 µM to the cells and collect the cells at 20, 60, and 180 min.\nTo induce TOP2α and β-DPCs and their ubiquitylation and SUMOylation, expose the cells to add the TOP2 inhibitor etoposide at 200 µM to the cells and collect the cells at 20, 60, and 180 min.\nTo induce non-enzymatic DPCs and their ubiquitylation and SUMOylation, add FA at 1 mM and collect the cells 2 h after the exposure.\nTo induce the PARylation of TOP1-DPCs, pre-treat the cells for 1 h to block dePARylation with poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) inhibitor PDD00017273 at 10 µM, followed by co-treatment with 20 µM camptothecin for 20, 60, and 180 min.\n2. Isolation and normalization of DNA containing crosslinked proteins\nQuickly aspirate the media with a suctioning pipette following treatment and rinse the cells with ice-cold 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Immediately lyse the cells in 600 µL of DNAzol reagent containing 1x protease cocktail inhibitor, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 20 mM N-ethylmaleimide (inhibitor of deSUMOylating and deubiquitylating enzymes).\nSlowly agitate the plate on a vibrating platform for 10 min at 4 °C.",
    "Add 1/2 volume of 100% cold ethanol (0.3 mL) directly to the plate and repeat step 2.2 until opaque nucleic acid aggregate becomes visible. Transfer the cell lysate to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and subject the tube to maximum speed (20,000 x g) centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C to precipitate the nucleic acid and its crosslinked proteins.\nAspirate the supernatant using a suctioning pipette and wash the nucleic acid pellet in 1 mL of 75% ethanol followed by 2 min of 20,000 x g centrifugation at 4 °C.\nAspirate the supernatant, spin down at the same speed, and remove the remaining liquid using a P20 pipette. Air-dry the pellet for 5 min.\nQuickly dissolve the nucleic acid pellet in 0.1 mL of ddH2O. Resuspend the pellet by repeated pipetting then incubate in a 37 °C water bath until the pellet swells to at least three times bigger (approximately 30 min).\nSonicate the samples with an ultrasonic processor probe at 30% amplitude for 10 s to fully dissolve the pellet.\nOptional step: Treat the samples with RNase A/T1 mix (10 µg of RNase A and 25 U of RNase T1) and incubate at 37 °C for 15 min. Add 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate and two volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol to the tube, followed by centrifugation at 20,000 x g for 10 min to retrieve the DNA. Remove the supernatant and dissolve the precipitated DNA in 0.1 mL of ddH2O.\nOptional step: Centrifuge the sample for 5 min at 20,000 x g and transfer the supernatant to a new tube.\nQuantify the DNA concentration using an ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrometer. The typical DNA yield is around 600-800 ng/µL. The A260/A280 ratio should be reduced from 2.0-2.1 to 1.8-1.9 after RNA removal.",
    "Adjust the concentration of the DNA to 400-500 ng/µL in 0.12 mL of ddH2O. Transfer 20 µL of the sample to a new microcentrifuge tube as undigested DNA loading control (refer to step 2.4).\nTo digest the DNA dissolved in the remaining 100 µL of ddH2O, add 2,000 gel units of micrococcal nuclease along with 1/10 volume (~11 µL) of 10x calcium micrococcal nuclease reaction buffer to the sample. Incubate at 37 °C for 30 min.\n3. Western blotting of digested DNA samples\nAdd 4x Laemmli sample buffer, then boil the sample for 5 min.\nLoad 5-6 µg of digested sample (~15 µL) onto 4%-20% polyacrylamide gel, followed by SDS-PAGE42 to resolve unmodified and PTM-conjugated DPCs.\nTo detect FA-induced non-enzymatic DPC species, incubate the gel with Coomassie blue stain overnight at room temperature. Wash the gel with ddH2O for 2 h and acquire an image using an imaging system.\nTransfer the gel and incubate the membranes overnight at 4 °C with appropriate dilutions of primary antibody in blocking buffer.\n\t\nTo detect ubiquitylation, make a 1:100 dilution of anti-ubiquitin antibody.\nTo detect SUMO-1 or SUMO-2/3 modification, make a 1:250 dilution of anti-SUMO-1 or anti-SUMO-2/3 antibody.\nTo detection ADP-ribosylation, make a 1:500 dilution of anti-PAR antibody.\nTo detect total TOP1-, TOP2α-, or TOP2β-DPCs, make a 1:500 dilution of anti-TOP1, anti-TOP2α or anti-TOP2β antibody.\n\t\tNOTE: Refer to the Table of Materials for details on antibody dilution.\nIncubate a 1x PBS-T (0.1% tween 20) washed membrane with a secondary antibody diluted 5,000-fold in blocking buffer for 60 min at room temperature.\nDevelop the membrane with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent and acquire an image using the imaging system.\n4. Slot-blotting of undigested DNA samples\nDilute the 20 µL undigested DNA sample in 180 µL of sodium phosphate buffer (25 mM, pH 6.6).",
    "Cut the nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 µm) and equilibrate for 5 min in the sodium phosphate buffer.\nAssemble the slot-blot apparatus according to the manufacturer's instructions and connect it to a vacuum system.\nWash the wells with sodium phosphate buffer by applying the vacuum. Make sure there is no leaking of the wells.\nStop the vacuum and load 200 µL of DNA per sample (1 µg). Fill the empty wells with 200 µL of sodium phosphate buffer.\nApply the vacuum.\nWhen all the wells are completely empty, stop the vacuum, load 200 µL of sodium phosphate buffer in each well, and repeat step 4.6.\nRetrieve the membrane and block with 5% blocking buffer for 0.5 h at room temperature.\nProbe with anti-double strand DNA (dsDNA) antibody at a 1:5,000 dilution overnight at 4 °C.\nWash 3x with 1x PBS-T and incubate with 1:5,000 diluted horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked anti-mouse secondary antibody.\nDevelop the membrane with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent and acquire an image using the imaging system.\n5. Densitometric analysis\nUsing ImageJ, calculate the ratio of the intensity of each band/smear relative to the intensity of the slot of undigested DNA and normalize the ratio to that of cells without/before drug treatment."
