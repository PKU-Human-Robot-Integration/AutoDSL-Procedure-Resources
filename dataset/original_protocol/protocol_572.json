    "1. Reconstitute Vn96 peptide to 2.5 μg/μl by adding 200 μl ME-buffer. Reconstitute the negative control Vn96-Scr peptide by adding 40 μl ME-buffer. Store at 4°C.\n  2. Transfer 200 µl of serum or plasma into a 1.5 ml microfuge tube.\n  3. Add 800 µl PBS.\n  4. Mix thoroughly.\n  5.  Add 5 μl protease inhibitor cocktail.\n  6. Centrifuge for 7 minutes at 17,000 xg at room temperature to remove debris.\n  7. Transfer supernatant to fresh tube, avoiding any pelleted material.\n  8. Add 20 μl reconstituted Vn96 peptide \\(use same amount of Vn96-Scr as a negative control).\n  9. Invert tube 10 times.\n  10. Incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes on a rotator.\n  11. Centrifuge for 7 minutes at 10,000 xg at room temperature to pellet extracellular vesicles.\n  12. Carefully remove and discard supernatant.\n  13. Wash by adding 1 ml PBS+5 μl protease inhibitor cocktail, inverting 10 times, centrifuging for 7 minutes at 10,000 xg at room temperature, and carefully removing and discarding supernatant.\n  14. Repeat wash.\n  15. Resuspend pellet in 100 μl PBS and continue on to miRNeasy protocol for RNA isolation."
