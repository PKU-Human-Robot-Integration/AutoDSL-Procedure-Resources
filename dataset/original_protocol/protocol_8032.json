  "procedures": [
    "All animal experiments were approved by the Finnish National Board of Animal Experiments and were carried out according to the European legislation on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes.\n1. Preparation \nPrepare dopamine neuron medium (DPM) with 0.46% D-glucose, 1% L-glutamine, 1% N2, 0.2% primocin, completed with DMEM/F12. Filter the DPM after mixing the ingredients. Store DPM at 4 °C and warm each aliquot only once.\n\tNOTE: DPM should not contain GDNF, as it will reduce α-synuclein accumulation in dopamine neurons23.\nPrepare siliconized glass pipettes that are extremely hydrophobic, thereby minimizing the attachment to the surface and loss of cells during the initial handling of embryonic neurons.\n\t\nAdd 10 mL of siliconizing fluid to 1 L of distilled water and mix by stirring in a 2 L vessel. Leave the glass pipettes immersed in the siliconizing solution for 15 min.\nRinse the pipettes 3–5x with distilled water. Dry the pipettes overnight at room temperature (RT) or for 1–2 h at 100-120 °C heated sterile space to speed up the drying.\nSterilize the pipettes by standard autoclaving in a sealed autoclave bag.\nPrepare poly-L-ornithine (PO) coated 96 well plates with transparent bottoms by adding 60 μL of PO solution into the middle wells of the 96 well plate to be used for seeding of the neurons, leaving at least one row/column of wells at the edges of the plate to avoid edge effects. Keep the coated plate overnight at 4 °C or 4 h at RT.\nPrior to plating the cells, aspirate PO completely and wash the cells thrice with 100 μL of 1x PBS. Aspirate 1x PBS from the wells and keep the lid of the plate open for complete drying.",
    "NOTE: It is possible to collect used PO and filter it for reusing. This can be repeated twice for the same PO solution.\nAdd 50 μL of DPM to previously coated wells. Aspirate DPM from the wells with a 100 μL plastic tip and simultaneously scratch the bottom of the well with circular movements to remove the coating at the perimeter of each well. A PO-coated island will remain in the middle of the well.\nUnder a laminar hood, add 10 μL of DPM to the middle of each coated island to create micro islands.\n\tNOTE: A plate with DPM-covered micro islands can be kept under the laminar flow hood for 1–2 h during the isolation of cells.\n2. Isolation of the ventral midbrain floor from E13.5 mouse embryos \nNOTE: Refer to Figure 1 for midbrain floor dissection steps.\nPrior to dissection, fill a 10 cm Petri dish with Dulbecco’s buffer and keep it on ice.\nEuthanize a E13.5 pregnant female mouse according to the institution’s guidelines. Place the mouse flat on its back and spray the anterior body with 70% ethanol. Lift the skin above the womb with forceps and make an incision with surgical scissors to expose the uterus.\nCarefully remove the uterus and place it into the previously prepared Petri dish on ice.\nUsing surgical scissors under the laminar hood at RT, carefully remove the embryos from the uterus. Remove all placental residue from the embryos with forceps and place them into a new 10 cm Petri dish filled with Dulbecco’s buffer.\nUsing dissection forceps or needles, cut off the hindquarter of the head from the places marked with black arrows in Figure 1A. Take the cut piece away from the rest of the embryo (Figure 1B).",
    "Place the posterior of the cut piece towards the observer (Figure 1C) and gently cut it open from caudal to cranial (Figure 1D). From 0.5 mm below the cranial opening, cut a 2 mm2–3 mm2 region, shown in Figure 1E.\nCollect the ventral midbrain floor (see Figure 1F) in an empty 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Keep the microcentrifuge tube on ice until all midbrain floors are collected in it.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, the midbrain floors can be collected with a 1 mL micropipette after dissection of all embryo brains.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61118/61118fig1v2.jpg\nFigure 1: Dissection of midbrain floor from E13.5 mouse embryo. (A) Cutting locations at the hindquarter of the head is marked with black arrows and white dashed lines. (B) The piece was removed from the rest of the embryo. The removed piece is circled. (C) The piece was turned 90° to face the posterior towards the observer. (D) The piece was opened from the black arrows, from caudal to cranial (marked with white dashed line). (E) From 0.5 mm–1 mm below the opening, the 2 mm2–4 mm2 region was cut (marked with black lines). (F) The ventral midbrain floor was isolated (marked with black dashed square). Scale bars = 1 mm.

Establishing primary embryonic midbrain cultures from E13.5 mouse embryos in 96 well plate format\nAfter the collection of midbrain floors from all embryos in the same 1.5 mL tube, remove the residual Dulbecco’s buffer and wash the tissue pieces thrice with 500 μL of Ca2+, Mg2+-free Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS).\nRemove HBSS and add 500 μL of 0.5% trypsin to the tube. Incubate it at 37 °C for 30 min.",
    "During incubation, warm 1.5 mL of fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C, add 30 μL of DNase I to the FBS, and mix. Also, fire-polish the tip of a siliconized glass pipette. Make sure that the hole has no sharp edges and is around the same size as a 1 mL micropipette tip.\n\tNOTE: As an alternative, a low adhesion 1 mL micropipette tip can be used for trituration. However, siliconized glass pipettes seem to give the best results.\nAs soon as the incubation in step 3.2 ends, add 500 μL of the FBS/DNase mix to the partially digested tissue. Use the glass pipette to triturate the tissue in the FBS/trypsin mix. Triturate until tissues dissociate into tiny, barely visible particles. Avoid bubbles during trituration.\nLet the leftover particles precipitate at the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube by gravity. Without pipetting the precipitate at the bottom, collect the supernatant into an empty 15 mL conical polypropylene tube.\nDilute FBS/DNase I from step 3.3 (98:2) with 1,000 μL of HBSS to obtain FBS/DNase-I/HBSS (49:1:50). Mix by pipetting up and down. Add 1,000 μL of the new mix to the leftover particles in the microcentrifuge tube. Triturate again and repeat step 3.5.\nRepeat the previous step once more to use up all FBS/DNase-I/HBSS (49:1:50).\nOnce all the supernatant is collected inside the 15 mL tube (from steps 3.5, 3.7, and 3.8), use a tabletop centrifuge to spin down the supernatant (~3 mL) at 100 x g, for 5 min. Remove the supernatant without touching the pelleted cells at the bottom.\nWash the cell pellet by adding 2 mL of DPM to the tube and spin it down at 100 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and repeat the washing 2x to minimize the debris in the pelleted cells.",
    "NOTE: Always use fresh, warmed DPM for the cultured neurons. For the washing steps, DPM does not have to be fresh, but should be prewarmed to 37 °C.\nDilute the cells with fresh, warm DPM and transfer them to a microcentrifuge tube. The amount of DPM for dilution depends on the number of embryos used for tissue dissection. For example, use 150 μL of DPM to dilute the cells obtained from ten embryos.\nTransfer 10 μL of cells in DPM to a microcentrifuge tube. Mix them with 10 μL of 0.4% Trypan blue stain. Count live (i.e., Trypan blue negative) cells using a hemocytometer or an automated cell counter.\n\tNOTE: Use 30,000 cells for plating per well to obtain ~1,000 dopamine neurons per well. If the cell density is higher than ~30,000 cells per 6 μL, further dilute the cells with DPM before plating so that the seeding volume is no less than 6 μL.\nWithout touching the bottom of the wells, remove the DPM from the micro islands created at step 1.6.\nIn order to obtain reproducible cell density at each well, mix the cells by gentle pipetting prior to plating in the well. With a 1–10 μL micropipette, add 6 μL of cells to the middle of the well, at the location of each former micro island.\nFill the empty wells at the edges of the plate with 150 μL of water or 1x PBS to minimize evaporation from the wells containing neuronal cultures. Incubate the plate in an incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 1 h.\nAfter 1 h, remove the plate from the incubator, add 100 μL of DPM into each well with cells and place it back in the incubator.",
    "Two days after plating (day in vitro 2, or DIV2), remove 25 μL and add 75 μL of fresh DPM to bring the final media volume to 150 μL and avoid evaporation as much as possible.\nExchange half of the medium with fresh DPM (i.e., remove 75 μL and add 75 μL fresh DPM) at DIV5. Do not perform any media changes after DIV5.\n4. Induction of α-synuclein aggregates in primary embryonic dopamine neurons by seeding with preformed fibrils\nProtocols for obtaining and validation of PFFs had been meticulously described and discussed in several recent publications11,28,29,30. Following any work with PFFs, clean the laminar hood or any equipment that might have contacted the PFFs with 1% SDS, then with 70% ethanol31.\nPrior to the experiment, dilute the PFFs with 1x PBS to a final concentration of 100 μg/mL. Sonicate the diluted PFFs in microcentrifuge tubes with a bath sonicator at high power with water bath cooling at 4 °C for 10 cycles, 30 s ON/30 s OFF.\n\tNOTE: It is critical that the fibrils be properly sonicated to generate fragments ~50 nm long. The size of sonicated PFFs can be measured directly from transmission electron microscope images of PFFs stained as described by Patterson et al.30. Sonication can be achieved as described above in a high power bath sonicator. Alternatively, a tip sonicator can be used30. Sonicated PFFs can be stored at -80 °C in small aliquots to avoid multiple freezing/thawing cycles.\nOn DIV8, add 3.75 μL of 100 μg/mL of PFFs per well to the 150 μL of medium in the well to a final concentration of 2.5 μg/mL. Use the same amount of 1x PBS for the control group.",
    "Prepare 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 1x PBS and store the aliquots at -20 °C. To do so, follow the steps below.\n\t​NOTE: PFA is toxic; wear a mask and gloves during preparation, work always under a laminar hood, and dispose of all solid and liquid PFA waste according to the institution’s directions.\n\t\nWarm 500 mL of 1x PBS in a 1 L vessel. Put a stir bar in the vessel and put the vessel on a magnetic stirrer with a heating function. Adjust the temperature between 40–60 °C to prevent boiling while keeping the solution warm.\nMeasure 20 g of PFA powder under the hood in a disposable plastic measuring container. Carefully, add the PFA powder into the vessel filled with 1x PBS. Start stirring the solution.\nAdd 200 μL of 5 M sodium hydroxide into the solution and continue stirring for ~15 min, until the PFA dissolves completely.\nAfter the solution appears homogenous, add 168 μL of 5 M hydrogen chloride to balance the pH to ~7. Check the pH with disposable color-fixed pH indicator strips.\nRemove the vessel from the heater and allow it to cool down to RT. Filter the solution and aliquot for storage at -20 °C. Thaw the aliquots at RT before the use and do not refreeze afterwards.\nOn DIV15, remove all media from the wells by pipetting. Add 50 μL of 4% PFA to each well to fix the cells and incubate for 20 min at RT. After incubation remove the PFA from the wells and add 100 μL of 1x PBS to each well to wash the cells. Remove 1x PBS and wash 2x more.\nLeave 100 μL of 1x PBS in each well to avoid drying. Store the plate at 4 °C until immunochemistry is performed.",
    "5. Immunofluorescent staining and automated imaging of primary embryonic dopamine neurons in 96 well plates\nRemove 1x PBS and permeabilize the cells by adding 100 μL of 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBST) per well and incubating at RT for 15 min.\nRemove PBST and add 50 μL of 5% normal horse serum (NHS) per well to the PBST. To block the unspecific antigen activity, incubate at RT for 1 h.\nDilute the primary antibodies against TH and pS129-αsyn (1:2,000) in 5% NHS in PBST. Add 50 μL of diluted antibodies to each well and incubate overnight at 4 °C.\nRemove antibodies and add 100 μL of 1x PBS to each well to wash the cells. Remove 1x PBS and repeat washing 2x.\nTo prevent the bleaching of fluorescent molecules, start working under minimum light conditions. Dilute the secondary fluorescently labeled antibodies (1:400) in PBST. Add 50 μL of diluted antibodies to each well and incubate at RT for 1 h.\nRemove the antibody solution and add 100 μL of 1x PBS to each well to wash the cells. Remove 1x PBS and repeat washing 2x.\nRemove 1x PBS, add 50 μL of 200 ng/mL 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) per well to stain the nuclei of the cultured cells and incubate at RT for 10 min.\nWash cells 3x with 100 μL of 1x PBS for 5 min each. Keep 100 μL of 1x PBS in each well after the last wash. Cover the plate with aluminum foil and store it at 4 °C until imaging.\nImage primary embryonic dopamine neurons in a 96 well view plate with a high-content plate scanner (see Table of Materials) fitted with a 10x objective.",
    "Adjust the settings based on the specifications of the 96 well plate, such as plate type, manufacturer, size, distance between wells, as well as type and amount of medium.\nSelect the imaging area of the well to cover all the cells in a micro island. Pick an example well to adjust the autofocus. Base the initial focus on DAPI.\nCalibrate the acquisition time for each fluorescent channel, based on the intensity of the staining in control wells. Adjust the parameters so that in PFF-treated control wells one can clearly distinguish dopamine cells harboring pS129-αsyn aggregates in cell soma allowing for unambiguous quantification of pS129-αsyn positive and pS129-αsyn negative cells.\n\tNOTE: Wells that do not contain PFFs should not have any staining for pS129-αsyn; therefore, these wells can be used as negative control for adjusting pS129-αsyn intensity.\nImage all the selected wells with a 10x objective simultaneously for all channels with immunofluorescence staining with exactly the same parameters.\nOptionally, label α-synuclein inclusions in a subset of the wells with antibodies specific for filamentous α-synuclein to confirm that changes in the number of pS129-αsyn-positive inclusions reflect the reduction in protein accumulation rather than inhibition of phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of pS129-αsyn.\nRepeat step 5.3 substituting pS129-αsyn antibody with α-synuclein filament antibody (1:2,000). Image the stained aggregated α-synuclein as in step 5.13.\n6. High-content image analysis \nNOTE: This step is performed with open access software CellProfiler version 3.15 and CellProfiler Analyst version 2.2.1.27,32.
