    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nHarvest and heat intact cell suspensions\nTiming: 1 h\nIn this step, cells treated with indicated drugs are harvested, then the intact cell suspension is heated in a PCR amplifier at the appropriate temperature.\nWash cell culture plates twice with 2 mL ice-cold PBS, add 700 μL ice-cold PBS to each plate.\nScrape adherent cells off the dishes using a cell scraper.\nDivide cell suspensions from different groups into PCR tubes (6 PCR tubes per group) with 100 μL suspension per tube.\nCritical: Divide the cell suspensions equally to make sure there are equal amounts of protein in the loading sample in the next step.\nHeat the cell suspensions individually at 45°C, 48°C, 51°C, 58°C, 65°C, and 69°C for 5 min in a PCR amplifier.\nCritical: The heating temperature and heating time vary between different proteins or drugs. Determine the appropriate heating temperature and heating time through pre-experiments. For the determination of suitable heating temperatures, set a temperature gradient from 40°C to 70°C, with intervals of 2°C–3°C. Keep incubation time (usually 3–6 h), incubate concentration and heating time constant. Then complete the full steps of the thermal shift assay to obtain a melting curve. For later experiments, choose the temperature where the protein is starting to degrade as the initial temperature point, while the temperature at which the protein is completely degraded as the ending temperature point. The temperature interval is usually 5°C–7°C. The optimization steps for the heating time are similar to that of drug concentration. The heating time is usually 3–5 min.\nCritical: This protocol may not be applicable to proteins that are rather unstable.\nPrepare protein extraction from heated cells\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step accomplishes protein extraction from the above-mentioned heated cells and preparation of samples for western blot analysis.",
    "Lyse the heated cell suspensions with three cycles of freeze-thawing with liquid nitrogen and a 37°C water bath.\nCentrifuge the cell lysate mixture at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nIsolate the soluble fractions from the cell debris, transfer them to microcentrifuge tubes (about 80 μL per sample).\nDetermine the protein concentration of each sample using a Bradford assay.\nAdd 20 μL of 5 × loading buffer to the protein extraction, mix completely and boil at 95°C–100°C for 10 min.\nPause point: The samples can be stored at −20°C for about one week. However, it is better to run as fresh as possible.\nAssess protein expression by western blotting\nTiming: 2 days\nThis step accomplishes the separation of proteins by SDS-PAGE, the transfer of proteins onto the PVDF membrane, imaging, and data analysis. Detection of no protein expression change in the mutant group after drug treatment means that the amino acid sites are involved in the drug-target engagement.\nRun SDS-PAGE\nTiming: 1.5–2 h\nPrepare pre-made (12% polyacrylamide) gels.\nCritical: Determine the appropriate polyacrylamide percentage to best resolve the specific protein of interest based on molecular weight.\nAlternatives: Purchased gels are excellent alternatives here.\nLoad the gels into the electrophoresis apparatus, fill it with 1 L Running buffer.\nCritical: The volume of Running buffer varies depending on the gel systems used.\nLoad samples containing equal amounts of protein (10–50 μg/lane) into the lanes of the SDS-PAGE gels.\nCritical: Include a molecular weight marker in one of the lanes to indicate the molecular weight. Set up gels for Coomassie blue, Ponceau S or Revert Total Protein Stan (LICOR) staining as a loading control.\nRun the gels at 120 V for 1–2 h, until the bromophenol blue reaches the bottom of the gels.",
    "Critical: Time and voltage may require optimization for different proteins and polyacrylamide gel percentage.\nTransfer protein from the gel into PVDF membrane\nTiming: 1–2 h\nTake out the gel from the electrophoresis apparatus, put it in a tray with Transfer buffer.\nPrepare PVDF membrane: wet PVDF membrane in methanol for 30 s and then soak it in the tray with Transfer buffer.\nCritical: Handle the membrane carefully, avoid scratching or puncturing the surface.\nAssemble the transfer sandwich:\nSequentially assemble the transfer sandwich in the following order:\nSponge layer.\nFilter paper layer.\nGel layer.\nPVDF membrane layer.\nFilter paper layer.\nSponge layer.\nGently remove any air bubbles with a scraper or roller, make sure no air bubbles are trapped in any layer.\nCritical: Make sure to remove any air bubbles, or the transfer of proteins to the membrane will be inhibited.\nPerform wet transfer:\nFill the transfer apparatus with Transfer buffer.\nPlace the transfer sandwich into it.\nRun at 300 mA for 1 h.\nCritical: Transfer time and voltage may require optimization according to the molecular weight of proteins.\nCritical: Keep the PVDF membrane wet at all time during the western blotting process.\nBlock the membrane and incubate with primary/secondary antibody\nTiming: 16–20 h\nRinse the PVDF membrane in TBST.\nIncubate the membrane in Blocking solution for 2 h at room temperature (20°C–25°C) with gentle shaking.\nRinse the membrane briefly in TBST to remove residual milk.\nIncubate the membrane with the primary antibody against Flag tag overnight (for 10–12 h) at 4°C with gentle rocking.\nCritical: Dilute the primary antibody with Primary antibody dilution buffer at the appropriate concentration. Here we used anti-Flag antibody for Flag-CypA WT or Flag-CypA C2A protein at 1:2000 dilution in Primary antibody dilution buffer.",
    "Aspirate the primary antibody solution and wash the membrane 3 times with TBST (10 min each with gentle rocking).\nIncubate the membrane with HRP conjugated secondary antibody solution for 2 h at room temperature (20°C–25°C) with gentle rocking.\nCritical: Dilute the secondary antibody in TBST at the appropriate concentration. May include 5% milk. Here we used Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) at 1:5000 dilution in TBST.\nCritical: The secondary antibody must recognize the host species of the primary antibody.\nWash the membrane 6 times with TBST (10 min each with gentle rocking).\nAcquire the image and analyze the data\nTiming: 1–2 h\nPrepare the Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate mixture: mix equal amounts of solution A and solution B provided by the manufacturer.\nCritical: About 2–3 mL of the mixture is required for a 12 cm × 6 cm membrane.\nRemove excess buffer from the membrane, incubate the membrane in the Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate mixture at room temperature for 10 s.\nExpose the membrane with the chemiluminescent imaging system Clinx.\nCritical: The incubation time may require optimization. More sensitive substrates require shorter incubation times to achieve optimal signal and avoid overexposure. LI-COR NIR secondary antibodies are better alternatives to avoid overexposure.\nCritical: Use multiple exposure lengths to identify the optimal exposure time.\nMeasure the band intensity using image analysis software such as Image J.\nCalculate the relative band intensity and draw the cellular thermal shift assay curve using GraphPad.\nCritical: We use total Flag-tagged CypA without any heating as the loading controls. A housekeeping protein is a good alternative."
