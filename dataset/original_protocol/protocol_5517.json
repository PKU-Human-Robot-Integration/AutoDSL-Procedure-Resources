    "Isolation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)Collect the blood from an apheresis blood unit by using a 30 ml syringe with an 18-G, 1-inch needle. Note: Dispense all blood products, tubes, and solutions in a biohazard bag.Slowly dispense 10 ml blood on the wall of a 50 ml tube containing 25 ml 1x calcium- and magnesium-free PBS. With steady flow, overlay the diluted blood on the wall of a 50 ml tube containing 15 ml Ficoll.Spin at 400 x g for 15 min without brakes.Collect the interphase, which contains the peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and transfer it to a 50 ml tube.Wash with RPMI 1640 with glutamine and 4% FBS (see Recipes) at 10x the volume and then spin at 400 x g for 5 min.Enrichment of human CD8 T cellsDecant the supernatant from step A6, and resuspend the cell pellet in enrichment buffer for counting (see Recipes).Take 10 µl of the cell suspension, add to 90 µl trypan blue (1:10 dilution), and then use a hemacytometer for counting (expected cell number is 108-109).After counting, prepare cell suspension at a concentration 5 x 107 cells/ml (if > 4.25 x 108 total cells, then use a 50 ml tube; if < 4.25 x 108 total cells, then use a 15-ml tube).Add the enrichment cocktail (included in the EasySep kit) at 50 µl/ml cells, mix well by pipetting up and down, and incubate at room temperature for 10 min.During the 10 min incubation, vortex the EasySep D magnetic particles for 30 sec or until you observe a uniform suspension.Add the particles at 150 µl/ml cells, mix well, and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.",
    "After a 5 min incubation, use enrichment buffer (see Recipes) to bring the cell suspension to a total volume of 10 ml if cell number < 4.25 x 108 total cells or 20 ml if > 4.25 x 108 total cells.Place the tube on the EasySep magnet.After 5 min, use a pipette to collect the negative fraction from the 50 ml tube. If a 15 ml tube was used, pour off the desired fraction, in one continuous motion, into a new 50-ml tube for counting (similar to step B2).

List of human antibody conjugated fluorochromes used for cell sortingimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171115/20171115213118_9801.jpgNote: All antibody dilutions are 1:100 except for anti-CD95 PECy7 antibody that is 1:20. Final volume is 100 µl. Live dead staining is performed prior to surface stains in serum-free pbs.Wash the cells with RPMI 4% FBS, and 0.02% sodium azide (see Recipes and Notes) and then spin at 400 x g for 5 min.Decant and stain for CD8, CD45RO, CD45RA, CD95, and living/dead stain and incubate at room temperature in the dark for 30 min.",
    "Wash the cells with FACS buffer and then spin at 400 x g for 5 min. Decant and pool all of the stained cells into a single tube for sorting.Sort live naïve and memory CD8 T cell subsets based on the following surface markers:Naïve CD8 T cells: CCR7+, CD45RO-, CD45RA+, CD95-Tem CD8 T cells: CCR7-, CD45RO+Tcm CD8 T cells: CCR7+, CD45RO+Tscm CD8 T cells: CCR7+, CD45RO-, CD95+Labeling sorted T cells with the proliferation-tracking dye CFSEWash the sorted cells with prewarmed FACS buffer (see Recipes) and then spin at 400 x g for 5 min.Decant and resuspend 500,000 cells in 1 ml prewarmed FACS buffer.Prepare 4 µM CFSE working solution (see Recipes), then add 1 ml working solution to 1 ml cell suspension, and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min.Wash with 50 ml cold RPMI and 20% FBS (see Recipes) and then place on ice for 5 min.Spin at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Repeat steps D4 and D5.Decant completely, resuspend in 150 µl culture medium (see Recipes), and transfer the cell suspension into a 96-well, round-bottom plate.Prepare IL-7 and IL-15 working solutions at 50 ng/ml each (see Recipes), and then add 150 µl working solution to the 150 µl cell suspension in the 96-well plate.Incubate at 37 °C in 5% CO2.After 7 days of culture, sort undivided and divided cell populations (third division or more) for DNA-methylation analysis as shown in Figure 1A (Abdelsmed et al., 2017).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171115/20171115213507_9392.jpgFigure 1.

    "Bisulfite sequencing analysis: Each horizontal line represents a clone while vertical lines are different CpG sites in the differentially methylated region. Open circles depict unmethylated CpG while filled circles depict methylated CpG. These data and analyses are representative of published data (Abdelsamed et al., 2017; Ghoneim et al., 2017).Loci-specific bisulfite-sequencing analysis (DNA-methylation analysis)Sorted cells are lysed, and DNA undergoes bisulfite treatment using the CpGenome Direct Prep Bisulfite Modification Kit.Bisulfite-treated DNA is used as a template to amplify a specific target sequence using JumpStart ReadyMix 2x. The Methylation-specific PCR program is as follows:95 °C for 5 min95 °C for 30 sec55 °C 1:30 minGo to step b 49 times4 °C indefinitelyPrepare 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (see Recipes).Pour the gel into the gel tray and then wait until it solidifies.Load the PCR product into the gel and then run the gel using 1x TBE (see Recipes).Cut the appropriate band size, digest the gel, and extract the DNA using the Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit.Use the entire PCR product for the ligation reaction using pGEM-T Vector System I kit. Note: Overnight incubation at 4 °C is recommended.Mix the ligation product with 50 µl XL-10–competent bacteria and place on ice for 20 min. Note: It is recommended to use one third of the ligation product for transformation and save the rest in -20 °C.Incubate the tubes containing bacteria/DNA mix at 42 °C for 45 sec.Place the tubes immediately on ice for 2 min.Add 400 µl S.O.C. medium to each tube and then incubate the tubes in a shaker (150 rpm) at 37 °C for 90 min.Spread 150 µl of the bacterial suspension on LB agar plates (see Recipes).Incubate at 37 °C for 18 h.",
    "In a deep 96-well plate, inoculate one white bacterial colony in each well containing 900 µl LB medium with 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin (see Notes). Incubate the cell cultures at 37 °C for 18-22 h with shaking (220 rpm).Spin the 96-deep well plates at 1,600 x g for 15 min.Decant the supernatant and then extract the plasmid from the bacterial pellet by following the instructions in DirectPrep 96 Miniprep Kit.Elute the DNA with 60 µl elution buffer, dry the 96-well plate overnight, and then use 300-600 ng DNA for Sanger sequencing using pUC/M13 reverse primers. Upload the Ab1 sequencing files as zip files to the QUMA website (QUantification tool for Methylation Analysis, http://quma.cdb.riken.jp/[href=http://quma.cdb.riken.jp/]). After analyzing the data by using the QUMA website, its readout is depicted as shown in Figure 1B."
