    "Isolation of conjunctival epithelial cells from the human/rabbit conjunctival tissues  The human/animal tissues used in this study were acquired from certified third-party facilities. Therefore, the procurement of eye tissues is not described in this protocol.Sterilize all forceps and tweezers in the autoclave before tissue processing.Conjunctival tissues from human donor biopsy:Transfer the human corneoscleral tissues from the preservation media to a sterile Petri dish and rinse with chilled PBS three times.Keep the tissues in chilled DMEM/F-12 with pen-strep upon dissection.Collect the conjunctival tissues from bulbar conjunctiva at 2–4 mm away from the limbus and keep the collected tissues in DMEM/F-12 with pen-strep. See Note 1.Conjunctival tissues from New Zealand white rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) eyeballs:Transfer the rabbit eyeballs from the preservation media to a sterile Petri dish and rinse with chilled PBS multiple times.Clean the tissues with forceps and surgical scissors to remove the residual blood clots, eye muscles, and hairs.Immerse the cleaned eyeballs in chilled DMEM/F-12 with pen-strep upon dissection.Gently pull up the conjunctival tissue away from the sclera with a tweezer. Inject chilled DMEM/F-12 with pen-strep into the subconjunctival region of the bulbar conjunctiva that is 3–5 mm away from the limbus for the blunt separation of epithelial tissues (Figure 1). After the injection, let the eyeball stand for a couple minutes on an ice block or in the fridge (maintain moisture), which allows the solution to spread in the subconjunctival region. See Note 2.Cut and collect the conjunctival tissues with surgical scissors and keep the tissues in chilled DMEM/F-12 with pen-strep. See Note 3.Transfer the tissues to a sterile 100 mm Petri dish and add a few drops of medium to maintain the tissue moisture. Mince the dissected tissues with a surgical blade until they are fine enough to be aspirated using a T-1000 pipette.",
    "Transfer the minced tissues to a centrifuge tube (use a 15 mL or 50 mL tube depending on the number of tissues). Resuspend the minced tissues with 0.5% type IV collagenase solution.Incubate the solution at 37 °C with 5% CO2  under agitation at 150 rpm for 30–60 min.Stop the digestion when all sizable conjunctival tissues are digested (some white sclera tissues might be found in the solution; keep them in the solution and continue forward).Dilute the cell-collagenase solution with DMEM/F-12 with pen-strep (at least 1:1) to facilitate the centrifugation.Pellet the cells by centrifuging at 400  × g  for 5 min. The centrifugation in this protocol was all performed at room temperature unless overwise stated.Resuspend the pellet with DMEM/F-12 with pen-strep and repeat the centrifugation (the pellet might be loose depending on the number of undigested tissue residues).Resuspend the pellet with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and incubate the solution at 37 °C for 10 min, then quench the reaction by adding DMEM/F-12 with 10% FBS and pen-strep.Pellet the cells by centrifuging at 200  × g  for 5 min.Proceed to Section B.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20221219/20221219222911_9501.jpg Figure 1.

(A) The conjunctival tissue on the injection site (red arrow) was gently pulled up with a tweezer and the injection was performed using a 30-gauge syringe needle. (B) After one injection, a bulge formed on the injection site (red arrow); the injection would be repeated on multiple sites (blue arrows indicating the potential injection sites). (C) An eyeball received complete injection and the injected solution spread in the subconjunctival region. (D) Isolated conjunctival tissues.",
    "Primary culture  Collagen coating: incubate the plate/dish with a 5 µg/cm2  collagen I solution at room temperature for 1 h (the collagen-coated plate should be prepared freshly).Resuspend the pellet with 5 mL pre-warmed culture media (CjSCM or control media).Filter the cell solution with 70 μm cell strainers and measure the cell concentration with a hemocytometer (the straining can be skipped if the experiment does not require a precise seeding density; this will retain the residual microtissues in culture and allow them to grow as explants and increase the overall cell yield).Seed the cells at a density of 1 × 104  –2 × 104  cells/cm2  on a collagen-coated surface.Mark the cells as Passage 0 (P0).Perform the primary culture in the incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2  for three days (avoid unnecessary movement).Change the culture media after three days and every other day from then on (pipette carefully and try to avoid disrupting the epithelial cell layer). See Note 4.Proceed to the Section C. Note: During the primary culture, CjSCs grow in homogeneous colonies. CjSCM can promote the formation of stem cell colonies and facilitate the outgrowth of CjSCs. The CjSC population can outgrow and dominate the total population during the primary culture phase.   In vitro expansion of CjSCs  Passage the P0 cells at 80%–90% confluence.Aspirate the culture supernatant and rinse three times with PBS.Add 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and incubate at 37 °C with 5% CO2  for 5 min.Stop the digestion by adding an equal amount of culture media with 10% FBS.Pellet the cells by centrifuging at 200  × g  for 5 min.Resuspend the pellet with pre-warmed culture media.Filter the cell solution with 70 μm cell strainers and measure the cell concentration.Seed the cells at a density of 2 × 104  cells/cm2  on a collagen-coated surface.Mark the cells as P1.",
    "Perform medium change every other day and passage the cells at 80%–90% confluence.Mark the cells as P(n+1) after every subculture (n represents the number of passage times before the subculture). Note: The cells expanded with CjSCM are uniform in size and show compacted, cuboidal, and homogeneous morphology. In contrast, the cells cultured with the control medium that contains no dSMADi or ROCKi display an elongated spindle shape (Figure 2).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20221219/20221219222924_6256.jpg Figure 2. CjSCM-expanded cells displayed uniform cell morphology.  Representative bright field images of primary human conjunctival epithelial cells cultured with control medium (left) or CjSCM (right) at P3. Scale bar = 100 μm. Basic characterization of CjSCs  Immunofluorescence staining and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) are performed to evaluate the expanded CjSCs in stemness, lineage, and proliferation by measuring corresponding markers on the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.Immunofluorescence stainingPassage the cells at a density of 1 × 104  –2 × 104  cells/cm2  on a collagen-coated slide chamber and culture for 12–24 h (start the staining at 60%–80% confluence). See Note 5.Wash once with PBS and fix the cells with 100 μL of 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, avoiding light.Wash the samples three times with 100 μL of PBS (10 min incubation each time).Perform permeabilization and blocking by incubating the samples with 100 μL of 5% (w/v) BSA solution containing 0.3% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature.Incubate the samples with the primary antibodies diluted in 100 μL of 5% (w/v) BSA solution at 4 °C overnight (antibodies are listed inTable 1). In this protocol, we adopted an epithelial stem cell marker (∆NP63), an ocular lineage marker (PAX6), and a proliferation marker (KI67) to evaluate the stem cell properties of the CjSCs.Wash the samples three times with 100 μL of PBS (10 min incubation each time).",
    "Incubate the samples with the secondary antibodies (Table 1) diluted in 100 μL of 5% (w/v) BSA solution for 1 h at room temperature, avoiding light.Wash the samples three times with 100 μL of PBS (10 min incubation each time), avoiding light.Incubate the samples with 100 μL of 1 mg/mL DAPI diluted in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, avoiding light. Make sure to wear personal protective equipment when working with DAPI. See Note 6.Remove the DAPI solution and rinse the sample with PBS.Aspirate all the solutions and disassemble the slide chamber.Air-dry the slides for 30–60 s.Mount the samples by adding Fluoromount-GTM  mounting medium and seal the samples with coverslips.Proceed to imaging with the fluorescent microscope or confocal microscope.

    "The immunofluorescence staining confirmed the expression of CjSC markers, highlighting the stemness, lineage, and proliferative activity of the cells cultured with CjSCM (Figure 3A). Real-time qPCR showed that the mRNA expression of epithelial stem cell marker and proliferation marker was upregulated in the cells cultured with CjSCM, while the expression of the mesenchymal marker was significantly downregulated (Figure 3B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20221219/20221219222949_1446.jpg Figure 3.

Scale bar = 50 μm. (B) Real-time qPCR showing the relative mRNA expression of  KI67, P63, PAX6  , and  VIM  in the cells expanded in CjSCM or control medium (mean ± SD, n = 4, *: P < 0.05, ***: P < 0.001). Cell doubling quantification  Cell doubling quantification is an optional experiment to measure the cell doubling time and replicative potential. We performed this experiment to validate the efficacy of the CjSCM in expanding CjSCs. The experiment was performed with fresh P0 cells that had not been subjected to any culture.Resuspend the pre-cultured P0 cells with pre-warmed media and seed the cells on a collagen-coated 12-well plate with 2 × 104  –4 × 104  cells per well (the number should be fixed among different groups for comparison).Perform medium change every other day.Passage the cells at 90% confluence.Aspirate the culture supernatant and rinse three times with PBS.Add 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and incubate at 37 °C with 5% CO2  for 5 min.Stop the digestion by adding an equal amount of culture medium with FBS.Pellet the cells by centrifuging at 200  × g  for 5 min.Resuspend the pellet with a pre-warmed culture medium.Filter the cell solution with 70 μm cell strainers and measure the cell concentration.",
    "Keep the cell count as a record for later calculation.Seed the cells in a density of 1 × 105  cells per well on a collagen-coated 6-well plate.Repeat the culture until desired passage number is met.Draw the cumulative cell expansion curve by plotting cell doubling with time. Calculate the cell doubling time using the formula: DT=∆T∙ln 2/ln(Q2/Q1)(DT  : doubling time;  ∆T  : culture time;  Q1, Q2  : the cell counts of two passages).Quantification of cell doubling in long-term culture showed that the cells cultured with CjSCM exhibited faster dividing and significantly shorter doubling time compared to those cultured with the control medium (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20221219/20221219223007_1615.jpg Figure 4. Cell doubling quantification.  Representative cumulative curve of cell doublings and the average cell doubling time (P1–8) of the human primary conjunctival epithelial cells in culture with CjSCM or control medium (mean ± SD, n = 3; ***: P < 0.001). Potency test: goblet cell differentiation  The potency is an optional experiment to validate the goblet cell differentiation potency of the expanded CjSCs. The test should be performed with cells after P1 to ensure homogeneity.Seed the cells in a density of 2 × 104  cells/cm2  on a collagen-coated surface and culture the cells with CjSCM (the efficiency will be higher if the differentiation is performed on a 3D hydrogel matrix or collagen-coated Transwell membrane).Initiate the goblet cell differentiation when the cell confluence reaches 90%–100% by switching the culture medium to the goblet cell differentiation medium.Perform medium change every other day for 5–10 days (pipette carefully and try to avoid disrupting the epithelial cell layer).Examine the goblet cell differentiation efficiency by immunofluorescence staining of the characteristic mucins expressed in the conjunctival goblet cells. See Note 7.",
    "Note: The goblet-like cells with granules will start to appear after 3–5 days of differentiation; the number of these cells will increase over time. However, because the survival of goblet cells requires the support of surrounding cells, the number of viable goblet cells might drop in an extended differentiation after 10 days. In our test, we detected the expression of mucin proteins (MUC1, MUC5AC, and MUC16) in the cells after a seven-day differentiation, suggesting that the CjSCs expanded with CjSCM retained their differentiation potency (Figure 5).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20221219/20221219223033_0102.jpg Figure 5.
