    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nStep 1: Installing and initializing the OmicsVolcano software tool\nTiming: <3 min\nDownload the OmicsVolcano software from the GitHub repository as zip folder.\nUnzip the folder into a directory of your choice, such as onto the Desktop.\nOpen RStudio.\nOpen the R script OmicsVolcano_App.r through RStudio, by selecting “File,” then select “Open File” and select OmicsVolcano_App.r that will be loaded into the RStudio interface.\nOnce the OmicsVolcano_App.r is loaded on the interface press the “Run App” button to load the OmicsVolcano software. Ensure that the “Run in Window” or \"Run External\" selection is checked when you press “Run App” (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/417-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Initializing the OmicsVolcano software in R studio\nScreen capture indicating how to select the run app in R studio to open the software.\nCritical: Check that RStudio is working correctly. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]\nCritical: Mac OS users are required to install the XQuartz app from https://www.xquartz.org[href=https://www.xquartz.org].\nNote: Once the software is downloaded and functional, steps 1–5 do not need to be repeated for future and continued use of the OmicsVolcano software.\nStep 2: Visualizing omics data\nTiming: 5 min\nThere are three menu options under the Home Page heading that enable the visualization and exploration of the data.\nPress the File – Open… tab to upload a user provided input file in a .txt format, not applicable (NA) or empty fields are allowed.\nNote: A demo file can be used for a test run. The demo file designated demofile.txt can be downloaded by selecting File – Open… - Download demo file to local PC. This demo file will be automatically downloaded in the user-selected folder and then used to visualize the data.",
    "If the file data is not formatted according to the instructions described in the Materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] then an error message will be displayed: “File Loading Error in Data Input File! Please check the number of columns or select the correct field separator character. Alternatively, review the Help Page for the file input format requirements.”\nIf the data has duplicates, for example in proteomic data sets when there are multiple isoforms of proteins, the default option of the software is to add a numerical extension for each duplicate in order of their appearance in the file provided. This is done so that duplicate names of proteins are not lost when they are visualized. However, if there are no duplicates in the data then the “Check for Duplicates” option can be unselected in the File - Open… - Check for Duplicates.\nPress Open…, select input file, and the data will appear in a table with the headings used in the input file. The headings can be toggled to order the data alphabetically, in an ascending or descending order of log2 fold changes, or based on the adjusted p values. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]\nSelect File Separator. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]\nTo visualize the data select Explore tab and then select Plot. This generates a volcano plot where the significantly increased and reduced data points are colored in red and blue, respectively. Non-significant data points are shown in gray (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Any data point can be labeled by clicking on the plotted data points (see 12). Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/417-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. A volcano plot example with specific interactively selected gene labels",
    "Transcriptomic data are visualized where significantly increased transcripts are shown in light red and significantly decreased transcripts in light blue. Non-significant transcripts are shown in gray. Three increased and three decreased transcripts are indicated in the plot as examples, showing the software’s capability to label individual transcripts of interest.\nThe significance and vertical thresholds can be adjusted from the right-side panel named Threshold.\nOptional: The software offers the option to choose statistical significance, which is recommended to be either 0.05 or 0.01. Another option is to adjust the log2 fold change threshold, which is set to +/-1 as the default value.\nSelect a data point on the volcano plot by pressing on it within the plot to provide a label for the identity of the gene or protein. Multiple data points can be labeled by holding Shift in Windows or Command in Mac platforms. The information for the selected data point can be seen in the table below the volcano plot. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]\nThe table below the volcano plot has two tabs, the Input Data tab shows all the data and the Signific tab lists all the significantly changing data. The Search box within the table enables the user to query specific gene or protein names.\nCritical: The data input file has to follow the format shown in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] above. Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11] and 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13]\nNote: The Help tab provides a brief guide to the use of the software. The About tab provides information about the authors, license, used packages and their versions, and how to cite the software.\nStep 3: Exploring omics data\nTiming: 5–30 min\nThe Explore tab has four additional features that enable interactive searches for specific genes or processes linked to specific genes.\nSelect Custom Gene List feature:",
    "Inserting a list of genes enables the user to manually input a user-specified list of genes that will appear on the volcano plot with gene or protein labels and their information in the table below the plot (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/417-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Volcano custom plot example including user-defined searches\nTranscriptomic data are visualized with significantly increased transcripts shown in light red and significantly decreased transcripts shown in light blue. Non-significant transcripts are shown in gray. User-specified transcripts or proteins can be searched in the right-hand box under “Custom Gene list” or uploaded in a user-defined file. The file-based import is useful when a large number of transcripts or proteins are to be searched and visualized in the plot. Dark red color indicates if they are significantly increased, and dark blue if they are significantly reduced within the dataset.\nThe Upload a gene file option enables the user to provide their own gene ontology lists from an enrichment analysis to highlight specific genes in a biological process, molecular function, or cellular compartment or a user-specified list of genes within a file. The file is rather simple, and each line of the file represents a gene name used for a process (see list below). The file does not require a header row.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_417_3.csv\nThe Mitochondrial Processes feature highlights all mitochondria specific genes or proteins in either bright red for the upregulated genes or proteins, or bright blue for the downregulated gene or proteins. Non-mitochondrial genes or proteins are shown as faded red or blue for those that are significantly increased or decreased (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). Limitations[href=https://www.wicell.org#limitations]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/417-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Volcano plot showing mitochondrial processes",
    "Transcriptomic data are visualized and mitochondrial transcripts are highlighted in dark red, dark blue, and dark gray, if they are significantly increased, decreased, or unchanged, respectively. Specific processes can be selected from the dropdown menu and these will be highlighted in either dark red or dark blue depending on their change within the dataset.\nAn additional feature of theMitochondrial Processes dropdown menu enables the exploration of 40 different processes linked to mitochondrial function present in the user-provided data. Selection of a specific process highlights a set of genes or proteins related to that mitochondrial process and shows them in bright red for the upregulated genes or proteins, or bright blue for the downregulated gene or proteins. This feature enables a fast identification of specific processes and genes or proteins that are significantly altered in the entire dataset (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nNote: The Custom Gene List features enables users to expand the scope of cellular and molecular processes that can be added to the software in addition to Mitochondrial Processes. The Mitochondrial Processes feature is an example of curated gene ontologies linked to MitoCarta 2.0 genes. Troubleshooting 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.15]\nThe Multiple Mitochondrial Processes function enables the selection and user-defined color selection of multiple processes to highlight all the changes in the dataset that are of interest to the user (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). The user should check the process of interest and select the color for the process and repeat this until all processes required by the user are selected then press “Apply” to show them on the plot as shown in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]. The right-hand panel shows the figure legend revealing the process linked to each selected color and the table below lists all the genes and their descriptions along with the colors representing them on the plot. Troubleshooting 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.17]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/417-Fig6.jpg",
    "Figure 6. Volcano plot showing specific selection and color coding of multiple mitochondrial processes\nThis dropdown menu allows the user to select specific processes and custom colors for each process and visualizes them on the plot. This feature enables additional multiple processes to be visualized at the same time.\nTheCellular Localization dropdown menu enables the exploration of different cellular compartments related to the changes in the user-provided data. This feature enables a fast identification of genes or proteins that are significantly altered in the entire dataset and related to a specific cellular location (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]). In the example, we identified that the loss of a specific gene with unknown function caused the downregulation of genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum function, providing a valuable and fast insight into the role of our gene of interest (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]). This can be applied to any dataset to quickly identify changes in different cellular compartments. Troubleshooting 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.17]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/417-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Volcano plot showing cellular localizations\nThis feature enables the user to explore changes in specific cellular locations by selecting specific cellular compartments from the dropdown menu. The selected cellular compartments are visualized depending on the changes (increased in dark red and decreased in dark blue) in the input file related to the selected cellular compartment (in this case the endoplasmic reticulum).\nStep 4: Exporting visualized data\nTiming: <1 min",
    "The final features of our software are the download options of the completed volcano plot and associated tables. All interactive plots can be downloaded in a vector format as SVG files directly from the plot by pressing the camera-like icon. The image is saved to the default PC location. Static plots generated by Custom Gene List can be exported in numerous different formats. Tables associated with the generated volcano plot can be downloaded in txt and csv formats depending on the requirements of the end-user.\nSelect the Export function and choose either Plot or Table.\nSelect Plot and in the first dropdown menu Custom Gene List can be exported as png, jpeg, or tiff for an image and SVG or pdf for a vector file.\nSelect Table and in the first dropdown menu and then select the type of table to export. In the second dropdown menu choose to save the tabulated data in csv or txt format.\nNote: Hovering the cursor over the volcano plot reveals a camera icon in the top right corner of the volcano plot. Selecting the camera icon enables a shortcut to download the volcano plot in SVG format to the PC default location. Selecting the camera icon enables downloading of volcano plots from each feature on OmicsVolcano. Users using the Ubuntu operating system can use this feature to download their plots."
