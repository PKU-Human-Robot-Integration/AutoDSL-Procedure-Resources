    "Notes:  To obtain a high yield of functional mitochondria the procedure must be done as fast as possible (preferably in less than 1.5 h) and the samples maintained on ice at all times.    The procedure described here refers to mice but can be used in rats by adapting the volumes. Functional assays should be carried out within 3-4 h of isolation.    Buffers can be made using potassium or sodium salts depending on the use of the mitochondria.    If potassium can affect the subsequent mitochondrial experiments, KCl can be replaced by mannitol.   Animal protocols must meet local ethics standards.   Preparation Starve animals overnight (8-16 h during the dark cycle) Note: Starvation is optional but leads to more reproducible results, especially in the liver.Prepare a container with ice and place:Dounce homogenizer and pestlesThree centrifuge tubes per sample (20-50 ml)One beaker containing extraction buffer per sampleCool centrifuge and rotor to 4 °C. Cool on ice Dounce and pestles (Figure 1).Animal dissection material (Figure 1)Small scissorsTweezersProcedureSacrifice the mouse by cervical dislocation, immediately remove the liver and place it in the ice-cold beaker with extraction buffer.Rinse the liver by adding and removing cold fresh extraction buffer until most of the blood is removed (5-6 washes). Mince the liver in the beaker in ice extensively using small scissors until homogeneus (Figure 3) Transfer the minced liver into a Dounce homogenizer and add approximately 3 ml of cold extraction buffer.With the homogenizer placed in the ice container, gently grind the tissue ten times with the A pestle (looser) and another ten with the B pestle (tighter). Avoiding the formation of bubbles is critical to obtain high quality mitochondria (Figure 4).Transfer the homogenate into a centrifuge tube (Figure 5) and complete to 30-40 ml with fresh cold extraction buffer.",
    "Follow the differential centrifugation steps (Figure 2)Centrifuge 10 min at 700 x g and 4 °C. Pour supernatant to a new ice-cold tube and discard the pellet containing nuclei and intact cells (Figure 6). Repeat the operation centrifuging again at 700 x g for 10 min at 4 °C and subsequently pouring the supernatant to a new ice-cold tube.  Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant and re-suspend the pellet (Figure 7) in ice-cold extraction buffer. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C, discard the supernatant and re-suspend the final pellet in the minimal possible volume (around 0.3 ml) of extraction buffer or the specific experimental buffer (Figure 8).Notes:After isolation, protein concentration is determined by standard methods. Typically, around 30-40 mg of mitochondrial protein are obtained from one liver. The quality of the isolated mitochondria can be determined their respiratory control ratio (RCR) using an oxygen electrode and measuring their oxygen consumption rate in the presence and in the absence of ADP. RCR should range 4-6 with pyruvate plus malate and 1.5-3 with succinate plus rotenone.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160517/20160517011252_9013.jpgFigure 2.
