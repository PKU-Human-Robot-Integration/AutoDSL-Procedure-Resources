    "Day 0 Preparation of inoculumTake the lyophilized E. coli cells and resuspend them in 1 ml of sterile LB broth.Incubate it at 37 °C overnight with constant shaking at 180 rpm in a Incubator-shaker.Microtiter plate functionalizationTake a sterile microtiter plate and coat it with 100 μl of 2.5 mM PBA prepared in filter-sterile carbonate buffer (pH 9.2).Incubate it overnight at 4 °C for the well surface to functionalize with PBA.Naïve aptamer library preparationAdd 10 μl of 100 μM ssDNA library to 190 μl of binding buffer.Incubate it at 95 °C for 10 min and transfer to ice-bath immediately to prevent rehybridization of the single stranded DNA library.Note: Step C2 can be repeated by reheating the DNA sample if user fails to transfer the materials to ice-bath. If heating on a heat-block with cooling assembly, use of cooling assembly to chill the samples should be avoided. Transfer this to 4 °C refrigerator to incubate overnight for the single stranded DNA oligos to take their respective 3D conformations.Day 1Growth and harvesting of cellsMeasure the growth of the inoculum using a spectrophotometer at λ = 600 nm. The optical density (O.D.) should be ≥ 1.Take 250 μl of inoculum and inoculate in 25 ml sterile LB broth.Note: Use 1% of 1 O.D. cells as inoculum for subculturing.  Incubate it at 37 °C at 180 rpm for 1.5 h, till the E. coli cells reach log-phase (0.5-0.6 O.D.). Note: For different cells, the growth curve can be measured prior to cell harvesting for SELEX rounds.  Centrifuge the culture at 3,000 x g for 10 min to form a soft pellet.Wash the cells thrice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (10 mM, pH 7.4) to remove residual media components.",
    "Note: Washing involves resuspending pellet in PBS, mild vortexing and pelleting at 3,000 x g for 10 min. Measure the O.D. using a spectrophotometer at λ = 600 nm. The optical density (O.D.) should be ≥ 1.Note: 1 O.D. E. coli cells correspond to approximately 1 x 108 cells. Further dilution of cells can be made in PBS. SELEX INITIAL ROUND: Exposure and ScreeningWash the PBA coated plate with carbonate buffer twice and resuspend 100 μl of the 1 x 103 cells in well 1.Incubate at 25 °C for 1 h, to allow the cells to coat the surface of the well.Decant the cell suspension by inverting the plate and wash the well with 200 µl of binding buffer thrice to remove any cells not bound to the well surface.Meanwhile, incubate 200 μl of prepared naïve library from Day 0 at 37 °C for 15 min. Gently add 200 μl of the prepared library to the well coated with cells.Incubate at 37 °C for 1 h.Decant the solution from the microtiter well by inverting the plate. Gently wash with 200 µl of binding buffer thrice to separate loosely bound sequences.Add 200 μl of elution buffer to the microtiter well.Incubate for 5 min at room temperature.Remove the solution from the well by using a micropipette carefully without touching the walls of the well and immediately neutralize by adding 10 μl of neutralization buffer to bring the pH to ~7.Quantify the obtained sequences using NanoVue spectrophotometer and label as Round 1.Note: To avoid any bacterial contamination due to detachment, the DNA elutes can be centrifuged at 3,000 x g for 10 min and supernatant taken, prior to quantification. The screened pool can be stored at -20 °C till further use.Note: Discard the contents in Steps B3, B7 and B8.",
    "Contents in Step B11 is to be saved and proceeded with for the next steps. Day 2SELEX INITIAL ROUND: Amplification and PartitioningThe Round 1 pool is further amplified to increase the concentration of the binding sequences. Carry the following steps on ice.To prepare the PCR reaction mixture (50 μl); mix the following components:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181015/20181015232118_2347.jpgRun the reaction on a thermocycler preheated at 95 °C using the following program:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181015/20181015232152_7211.jpgHeat the PCR product at 95 °C for 10 min. Transfer the denatured PCR product to ice immediately and add 5 μl of Streptavidin-Gold bio-probe. Note: The DNA denaturation (see Step C2 of Day 0) can be repeated by reheating the DNA sample if user fails to transfer the materials to ice-bath. If heating on a heat-block with cooling assembly, use of cooling assembly to chill the samples should be avoided. Incubate the mixture at 4 °C for 30 min, allowing the streptavidin on the gold nanoparticles to interact with the biotin on the antisense strand.Transfer the contents to a 1.5 ml MCT chilled at 4 °C and centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C to separate the sense and antisense aptamer pool strands.Harvest the supernatant containing the ssDNA and discard the pellet.Note: The pellet will be red and the supernatant should be clear. Quantify the supernatant on NanoVue spectrophotometer to estimate the amount of ssDNA present.Store the amplified product at -20 °C till further use.Days 2-4SELEX ITERATIVE ROUNDS: Binder exposureDilute the amplified ssDNA binder fraction from Day 2 with binding buffer to a final amount of 1 x 1014 molecules/100 μl (4.44 µg ssDNA/100 µl binding buffer).Add to two cell-coated microtiter wells and incubate the microtiter plate for 1 h at 25 °C, similar to the initial round.",
    "Repeat the steps for screening, amplification and partitioning as previously mentioned in earlier text.Repeat the same procedure (the above steps 1-3) till Round 6 by doubling the number of cell-coated wells with each round. (Round 5 will be performed using 16 wells.) Quantify the DNA obtained in each round and compare the increase in DNA concentration. A typical SELEX progression is shown in Figure 2. An increase in binder fractions can be monitored by measuring the concentration of ssDNA aptamer binder pool screened at each round by taking absorbance using a spectrophotometer at λ = 260 nm. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181015/20181015232004_9896.jpgFigure 2.
