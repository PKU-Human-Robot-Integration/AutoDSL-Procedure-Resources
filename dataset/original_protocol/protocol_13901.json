    "The study presented herein was approved by Bioethics Committee of Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń (KB 628/2015). Remember to always wear a lab coat and any other required personal safety equipment, such as (but not limited to) safety gloves and glasses. Do not touch the extraction phase of the solid phase microextraction (SPME) probes.\n1. Preparation of the SPME devices\nUse probes (fibers) with mixed-mode and C18 coatings for metabolomics and lipidomics, respectively. Collect two sets of samples, one for metabolomics and one for lipidomics.\nAdjust the coating of the probe to an optimum length by trimming the SPME probe. In the current study, the selected coating length was 7 mm. Select the length of the fiber according to the size of the tumor under study, ensuring that the entire sorbent can be immersed in the tumor (Figure 1).\nCondition the coatings of the probes by soaking them in methanol: water 50:50 v/v mixture for a minimum period of 1 h before the extraction procedure. Transport fibers to the site of sampling (e.g., hospital) in a vial containing the conditioning solution.\n2. Sample collection procedure\nDo not wash or pretreat the tumor in any way prior to SPME extraction.\nStart the sampling as soon as possible after the tumor removal (2 min in the presented study).\n\tNOTE: Adjust the time depending on the on-site set-up for a given facility (distance of researcher’s working site from the operating table) and keep it constant for the entire study. Minimizing the elapsed time between tumor removal and start of the extraction is crucial for the capture of unstable metabolites that degrade after blood circulation is cut off from the studied tissue.",
    "Perform sampling at room temperature. Alternatively, place the sample on ice when the extraction is carried out. In either case, maintain the same conditions for the whole set of samples.\nTake the probe out from the vial.\nWash fibers with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) grade water for 5 s by immersing them in LC/MS grade water. Do not let the sorbent dry prior to the fiber insertion to ensure good reproducibility of data.\nInsert the fibers into the brain tumor tissue as far apart as possible, ensuring that the entire extraction phase is located inside the tumor.\n\tNOTE: It is recommended that extractions be carried out in replicate in order to determine the heterogeneous nature of the tumor (Figure 2). Three replicates per sample are recommended.\nLeave the probe for 30 min in the tissue (measured with a timer).\nUse blank controls to eliminate sources of error related to the presence of artefacts stemming from sources other than the sampled tumor. To obtain blank controls, subject fibers to the same analytical workflow, as described above, but without the sampling step (insertion in the tissue or any other sample/matrix). In the data processing step, compile the analytes extracted from these fibers into an “exclusion list” to exclude signals derived from contaminants stemming from solvents or fiber manufacturing. It is recommended that at least 3 replicates of blank are used.\n\tNOTE: To check for the risk of contamination, it is necessary to perform sampling from gloves, tables, apparatus or any other surfaces that may pose a contamination risk. In such cases, fiber preparation, time of extraction, and desorption protocols are the same as that for the samples.\nWhile extraction is being carried out, label the vials to be used for storage of the probes after extraction.",
    "After 30 min, remove fiber(s) from the brain tumor.\nWash fibers with water for 3 s by immersing them in LC/MS grade water to remove residues of blood or cell debris from the probe so the final extract contains only small molecules. A longer washing step is not recommended as it may lead to the loss of polar compounds.\nImmobilize the fibers in the pre-slit septa of the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) vial cap by piercing the septa from the bottom with the non-coated end of the fiber.\nPut the fibers immobilized in the cap in separate HPLC vials and place them in the selected transportation container.\nPerform steps 2.11-2.13 for fibers dedicated to blank controls.\n3. Transport and storage\nNOTE: Several options are available for transporting samples to the laboratory. It is recommended that a liquid nitrogen Dewar or polystyrene box filled with dry ice be used for transportation; alternatively, ice packs can be used for immediate and quick transportation.\nPlace the vials with fibers in the transportation container.\nUpon laboratory arrival, immediately place vials with SPME fibers in a -80 °C or -30 °C freezer. Do not store fibers longer than 3 years at -30 °C or 5 years at -80 °C.\n4. Sample preparation for metabolomics analysis\nNOTE: This step should only be performed once all samples for an experiment have been collected.\nBefore instrumental analysis, prepare desorption solvent mixture: acetonitrile:water 80:20 v/v.\nTake out the vials containing the mixed-mode fibers from the freezer. Use these for metabolomics analysis.\nLabel vials to be used for desorption.\nPipette 300 μL of the desorption solution (prepared in step 4.1) into glass inserts placed in 2 mL vials.",
    "Perform desorption from each fiber placed in a separate insert by fully immersing the coating in the desorption solvent, then agitating it for 120 min at 1,200 rpm using vortex.\nAfter 120 min (once desorption is completed) remove caps with probes.\nPrepare QC sample by mixing 10 μL aliquots of each sample from the sample set. The sample set size depends on the experimental design. It is important to analyze all samples as one batch.\nClose the vials with new caps.\nPlace the vials in the autosampler (4 °C) of the liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometer (LC-HRMS) and move to step 5.\n\tNOTE: Randomize injections order of the samples including control blanks. Inject QC sample after every 8-10 samples to monitor the stability of the instrument.\n5.
