    "1. Preparation of P. aeruginosa PAO1 and Escherichia coli OP50 Culture\nPrepare 500 mL of sterilized Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (Table 1) and inoculate a single colony of P. aeruginosa into the medium. Incubate the culture for 14 to 15 h at 37 °C with a shaking speed of 150 rpm.\nEqually distribute the bacterial culture into two 500 mL centrifuge tubes and centrifuge the tubes at 3,220 x g at 4 °C for 30 min.\nRemove the supernatant until the volume is 50 mL (one-tenth of the initial volume) and resuspend the bacterial pellet.\nStore the concentrated bacterial culture at 4 °C until use. The storage period of P. aeruginosa culture can be up to 1 month, but fresh culture is better for inducing intestinal damage.\nNOTE: The protocol can be paused here. In addition to the whole live bacteria, the supernatant of the bacterial culture can be used to test the effects of the intestinal bacteria19.\nTo prepare E. coli OP50, culture E. coli OP50 in DYT medium (Table 1) and then apply similar steps to those described above but decrease the volume to one-sixth of the original volume. For example, if the initial volume is 500 mL, after removing supernatant, the remaining volume is approximately 83 mL.\nNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\n2. Preparation of Enterococcus faecalis KCTC 3206 Culture\nPrepare 500 mL of sterilized brain heart infusion (BHI) broth (Table 1).\nInoculate one colony into 500 mL of BHI broth and incubate the culture for 14–15 h in a shaking incubator at 37 °C and 150 rpm.\nEqually distribute the bacterial culture into two 500 mL centrifuge tubes and centrifuge the tubes at 3,220 x g at 4 °C for 30 min.",
    "Remove the supernatant until the volume is 50 mL (one-tenth of the initial volume) and resuspend the pellet.\nStore the concentrated bacterial culture at 4 °C until use. The fresh culture is better for testing the effects on the intestinal permeability.\nNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\n3. Preparation of Heat-inactivated E. coli OP50 and Heat-inactivated P. aeruginosa PAO1 Cultures\nCulture and harvest the bacteria as described above (steps 1.1–1.3).\nHeat-inactivate the E. coli OP50 or P. aeruginosa PAO1 culture as described previously20,21,22. For heat inactivation, incubate the resuspended bacteria at 65 °C (water bath) for 30 min.\nCool the concentrated bacterial culture to room temperature and store it at 4 °C until use. The storage period can be up to 1 month.\nNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\n4. Preparation of Nematode Growth Medium (NGM) Plates for Testing the Effects of Different Bacteria on the Intestinal Permeability of C. elegans\nPlace 1.25 g of peptone, 1.5 g of NaCl, 8.5 g of agar, a magnetic stirrer and 487.5 mL of distilled water in a 500 mL glass bottle (Table 1).\nMix the mixture well, autoclave the mixture for 15 min at 121 °C and cool the mixture to 55 °C in a water bath for 30 min.\nRemove the medium from the water bath, add the components (0.5 mL of 1 M CaCl2, 0.5 mL of cholesterol, 0.5 mL of MgSO4, 12.5 mL of KPO4) (Table 1) to the NGM, and mix well.\nNOTE: All the individual components must be autoclaved except for cholesterol (dissolved in absolute ethanol), and every experimental step must be carried out on a clean bench.",
    "Distribute 20 mL of NGM to each 90 x 15 mm Petri dish and allow the agar to solidify on a clean bench at room temperature (approximately 20 °C). The NGM plates can be stored for up to one month at 4 °C.\nNOTE: The protocol can be paused here. The NGM plates used for FITC-dextran staining were prepared by the same procedure (from steps 4.1–4.3). 10 mL of NGM was distributed to each 60 x 15 mm Petri dish and allowed to solidify on a clean bench at room temperature (approximately 20 °C).\nRemove the bacterial culture from the 4 °C refrigerator and vortex the culture thoroughly before spreading the culture onto the NGM plates.\nAdd a total of 800 µL of the bacterial culture to each fresh NGM plate, and allow the plates to dry in a 20 °C incubator overnight.\nNOTE: For the first experiment (Figure 1), two NGM plates with E. coli OP50, one NGM plate with P. aeruginosa PAO1, and one NGM plate with E. faecalis KCTC3206 were prepared. For the second experiment (Figure 2), two NGM plates with live E. coli OP50, one NGM plate with live P. aeruginosa PAO1, and one NGM plate with heat-inactivated P. aeruginosa PAO1 were prepared.\n5. Preparation of NGM Plates for Testing the Effects of a Chemical (DIM) on the Intestinal Permeability of C. elegans Fed with P. aeruginosa\nAdd 0.5 g of peptone, 0.6 g of NaCl, 195 mL of distilled water, a magnetic stirrer, and 6.8 g of agar to a 500 mL glass bottle (NGM agar).\nAdd 0.5 g of peptone, 0.6 g of NaCl, 195 mL of distilled water, and a magnetic stirrer without agar to another 500 mL glass bottle (NGM broth).",
    "Autoclave the two bottles (from steps 5.1–5.2), one empty 100 mL glass bottle, and one empty 500 mL glass bottle for 15 min at 121 °C. Then, allow the medium containing bottles to cool to 55 °C in the water bath for 30 min. Keep the agar medium in the water bath and remove the bottle containing broth (from step 5.2) for the next step.\nAdd the additive chemicals to the NGM broth: 0.4 mL of 1 M CaCl2, 0.4 mL of cholesterol in ethanol (mL), 0.4 mL of 1 M MgSO4 and 10 mL of 1 M KPO4 (all of these components must be sterilized apart from the cholesterol in ethanol). Then, stir the mixture thoroughly with a magnetic stirrer at 55 °C.\nLabel the autoclaved empty 500 mL glass bottle with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and the autoclaved empty 100 mL glass bottle with DIM.\nTransfer 50 mL of NGM broth into the DIM-labeled 100 mL bottle. Add 500 µL of 20 mM DIM stock into the bottle and mix well.\nNOTE: DIM is dissolved in DMSO (20 mM DIM stock).\nQuickly remove the NGM agar medium from the water bath, add 50 mL of the NGM agar medium into the DIM-labeled bottle and mix thoroughly.\nPlace a 20 mL aliquot of DIM-containing NGM medium into each 90 mm x 15 mm Petri dish. Approximately five DIM-containing NGM plates can be made from this step.\nNOTE: The final concentration of DIM in each NGM plate will be 100 µM.\nTo prepare the DMSO-containing NGM plate, transfer 150 mL of NGM broth into the DMSO-labeled 500 mL bottle. Add 1.5 mL of DMSO to the bottle and mix well.\nAdd 150 mL of the NGM agar medium to the DMSO-labeled bottle and mix thoroughly.",
    "Place a 20 mL aliquot of DMSO-containing NGM medium in each 90 mm x 15 mm Petri dish. Approximately fifteen DMSO-containing NGM plates can be made from this step.\nNOTE: The final concentration of DMSO in each NGM plate will be 0.5%.\nSolidify the plates at room temperature for at least 3 h and store them at 4 °C until use.\nNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\nRemove the E. coli OP50 or P. aeruginosa PAO1 culture from the 4 °C refrigerator (from step 1.4) and vortex the culture properly before spreading onto the NGM plates.\nPut 800 µL of the E. coli OP50 or P. aeruginosa PAO1 bacterial culture onto each fresh NGM agar plate and allow the plates to dry in a 20 °C incubator overnight.\nNOTE: The protocol can be paused here. For the third experiment (Figure 3), two DMSO-containing NGM plates coated with live E. coli OP50, one DMSO-containing NGM plate coated with live P. aeruginosa PAO1, and one DIM-containing NGM plate coated with live P. aeruginosa PAO1 were prepared.\n6. Preparation of Age-synchronized C. elegans\nGrow worms on a solid NGM plate and feed them with E. coli OP50 until the desired population is reached.\nSynchronize the eggs by using either the timed egg laying method or the bleaching solution treatment as described previously20,23,24.\n7. Treatment of Bacteria or DIM and FITC-dextran Feeding\nIncubate the age-synchronized eggs at 20 °C for 64 h on NGM plates supplemented with live E. coli OP50 as food.\nWash the age-synchronized L4 larva with S-buffer and transfer them (more than approximately 500 worms) to the treatment NGM plates containing different bacteria and chemicals (described in NOTE following step 4.6 and 5.14,). Incubate them at 20 °C for 48 h.",
    "NOTE: The treatment time can range from 24 to 72 h, according to the bacteria and chemicals used. The therapeutic or preventive effect of DIM can also be evaluated by pretreating the worms with pathogens and then treating the worms with DIM (the therapeutic effect) or by pretreating the worms with DIM and then treating with pathogens (the preventive effect)19.\nTo prepare the FITC-dextran-supplemented plates, mix 2 mL of heat-inactivated E. coli OP50 with 4 mg of FITC-dextran. Then, divide 100 µL of the FITC-dextran and E. coli OP50 mixture into twenty fresh NGM agar plates (60 mm x 15 mm) and allow the plates to dry for 1 h on a clean bench.\nNOTE: The final concentration of FITC-dextran in each NGM plate will be 20 μg/mL.\nPrepare five E. coli OP50-containing NGM plates without FITC-dextran for the vehicle control treatment. For this purpose, divide 100 µL heat-inactivated E. coli OP50 to each fresh NGM agar plates (60 mm x 15 mm) and allow the plates to dry for 1 h on a clean bench.\nNOTE: For each independent experiment, fifteen FITC-dextran-supplemented NGM plates and five NGM plates without FITC-dextran are required.\nAfter 48 h of treatment (from step 7.2), wash the worms with S-buffer, transfer the worms to the FITC-dextran supplemented plates and the NGM plates without FITC-dextran, and incubate the plates overnight (14–15 h).\nNOTE: For each treatment group, 5 replicates of FITC-dextran staining (or vehicle control feeding) are required.\nWash the worms with S-buffer and allow them to crawl in the fresh NGM agar plate for 1 h.\nNOTE: For each independent experiment, a total of 20 fresh NGM plates are needed. In this step, you can use the NGM plate supplemented without or with E. coli OP50.",
    "Add 50 µL of 4% formaldehyde solution to each well of a black 96-well flat-bottom plate. Transfer approximately 50 worms from each NGM plate into each well for fluorescence measurements. After 1 to 2 min, thoroughly remove all the formaldehyde from each well and add 100 µL of mounting medium to coat the wells.\nNOTE: Formaldehyde solution (4%) is used to immobilize and fix the worms. For each treatment group, 5 wells (5 replicates) are used for image analysis.\n8. Imaging C. elegans with the Operetta Imaging System and Determination of Intestinal Permeability by Measuring the FITC-dextran Fluorescence Uptake\nNOTE: Fluorescent stereomicroscopy can be used for image analysis instead of the Operetta system.\nCapture fluorescence images and measure the fluorescence intensity using the Operetta High-Content Imaging System and analyze the images with Harmony software.\nIn the Harmony software, press the icon Open lid to open the lid and to put the plate into the machine.\nSet up the parameters.\nClick Set up, select the plate type (96-well corning flat-bottom) and add the channels (bright-field and EGFP channels).\nAdjust the layout. Go to the Layout selection, and then select Track and adjust the parameters (first picture at 1 µm, number of planes are 10, distance is 1 µm).\nSelect one of the treatment wells and one capture field and press Test to check whether the pictures are satisfactory in the Run experiment section.\nIf the pictures are satisfactory, return to the Set up section and press the Reset icon at the end of the screen. Then, select all the target wells and a suitable number of capture fields.\nGo to Run experiment again and enter the plate name, then press Start to begin processing.",
    "To measure the intensity of the fluorescence, go to the image analysis section and input the image. Find the cell by choosing the EGFP channel and method B. Adjust the common threshold to 0.5, area to >200 µm2, split factor to 3.0, individual threshold to 0.18 and contrast to more than 0.18. Then, calculate the intensity properties and choose the mean as the output. Press the Apply icon to save the setup.\nGo to the Evaluation section to measure the intensity by obtaining a heatmap and data table. Set the Readout parameter to Cells — Intensity Cell EGFP Mean — Mean per Well and start the evaluation.\nNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\nTo extract the data from Operetta, click the Setting button and choose Data management.\nChoose Write archive, and then open the browse and select the file.\nTo select the file, click the small + signal at the left corner, and then click Measurement and choose Plate name.\nSelect the file and click OK.\nSelect the path to save the file by clicking the Browse signal at the active path.\nClick Start to save the data file.\nNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\n9. Statistical Analysis of the FITC-dextran Fluorescence of C. elegans\nImport the data and calculate the mean and standard deviation (SD) using a statistics software.\nAnalyze the significant difference with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test.\nSubscription Required.
