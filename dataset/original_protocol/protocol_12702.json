  "procedures": [
    "1. Primer Design\nDesign gene-specific primers for reverse transcription (RT) using PCR primer design software (Table of Materials) based on the general rules of primer design17.\nNOTE: RT primers are highly specific to the target transcripts, and they are generally anchored on the 5’ part of coding sequences (mature mRNAs and precursor RNAs), or ~500–600 nt downstream of the anticipated 5’ end (18S and 26S rRNAs).\nDesign pairs of divergent primers to amplify the circularized transcripts by cRT-PCR.\n\tNOTE: The paired divergent primers flank the 5’-3’ junction of the circularized transcripts, and their positions vary among the target transcripts analyzed (Figure S1). Some transcripts have long UTRs; for example, nad2-1 5’ UTR and rps4-1 3’ UTR are 1,985 and 1,826/1,834 nt, respectively1. If both primers are anchored on coding region, it will be hard to amplify the target transcripts. By contrast, some UTRs are short; for example, the 3’ UTRs of nad2-1 and nad4-1 are 34/35 and 29–31 nt, respectively1. If the paired primers are located far away from the coding sequences, the PCR will fail. Generally, two pairs of divergent primers are designed for each target transcripts, while multiple pairs may be necessary to map those whose transcript patterns are complicated and/or UTRs are very long.\nDesign pairs of convergent primers to prepare RNA probes for Northern blot.\nNOTE: The paired primers are located on coding region of the target gene, and the size of the PCR product should be in the range of 100 to 1,000 bp. Each forward primer should contain a restriction enzyme site to minimize vector sequences in the resulting probes.\n2. Preparation of Crude Mitochondrion from Maize Developing Kernels\nSterilize pestles, mortars, glass funnels, tubes, and tips by autoclave, and dry them in oven.",
    "Perform all procedures at 4 °C or on ice, and pre-cool all solutions.\nPrepare 100 mL of extraction buffer (EB), composed of 0.3 M sucrose, 5 mM tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 10 mM KH2PO4, 2 mM EDTA, 1% [w/v] polyvinylpyrrolidone 40, 1% [w/v] bovine serum albumin, 5 mM L-cysteine, and 20 mM ascorbic acid. Adjust to pH 7.3 with KOH and sterilize by filtration.\nPrepare 100 mL of wash buffer (WB) consisting of 0.3 M sucrose, 1 mM EGTA, and 10 mM MOPS (3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid). Adjust to pH 7.2 with NaOH and sterilize by filtration.\nNOTE: It is suggested to prepare EB and WB using DEPC-treated deionized H2O.\nCollect 20 g developing kernels at 11–20 days after pollination (DAP) to a 50-mL tube placed on ice, and then transfer the kernels to pre-cooled mortars.\nNOTE: Use a ratio of 100 mL of EB to 20 g of maize kernels.\nAdd 10–20 mL of ice-cold EB to each mortar, and grind the kernels completely.\nAdd more EB, and filter the ground tissues through two layers of filter cloth (Table of Materials).\nCentrifuge the filtrate at 8,000 x g for 10 min, and discard the pellet.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new tube, and centrifuge it at 20,000 x g for 10 min.\nPour off the supernatant, and resuspend the pellet in 6 mL WB.\nAliquot the suspension to five 1.5 mL RNase-free tubes, and centrifuge them at 14,000 x g for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant, freeze the mitochondrial pellet in liquid nitrogen, and store at -80 °C.\n3. Extraction of Mitochondrial RNA\nExtract mitochondrial RNA with a commercial reagent (Table of Materials) according to the manufacture’s instructions.\nCAUTION: This reagent contains phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate. Work with it in a fume hood, and wear lab coat and gloves.",
    "Dissolve the isolated mitochondrial RNA in DEPC-treated deionized H2O, and estimate RNA concentration and purity with a spectrophotometer (Table of Materials).\nNOTE: Generally, ~250 μg mitochondrial RNA is obtained from 20 g of 15-DAP maize kernels.\nPrepare one agarose gel composed of 1x TAE buffer (40 mM Tris, 20 mM acetic acid, 1mM EDTA), 1.5% agarose (Table of Materials), and 1x nuclear staining dye (Table of Materials).\nAdd an appropriate volume of 10x loading buffer (0.5% bromophenol blue, 0.5% xylene cyanol FF, and 50% glycerol), and load mitochondrial RNA/Loading buffer mixture on the 1.5% agarose gel.\nRun the gel in 1x TAE buffer at 5–6 V/cm for 20–25 min, and evaluate mitochondrial RNA integrity by imaging the gel with a gel documentation system (Table of Materials).\nNOTE: The presence of two distinct bands (~3,510 and ~1,970 nt for maize mitochondrial 26S and 18S rRNAs, respectively) is an acceptable standard for intact mitochondrial RNA. To exclude possible degradation, RNA integrity should be investigated during the multiple steps of circularized RNA preparation (Figure 2).\n4. RNA 5’ Polyphosphatase Treatment\nSet up RNA 5’ polyphosphatase (Table and Materials) treatment (Table 1), and incubate at 37 °C for 30–60 min.\nRecover the 5’ polyphosphatase-treated RNA with an RNA purification kit (Table of Materials) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nRepeat steps 3.3 to 3.5.\n5. RNA Circularization\nPrepare two circularization reactions using the same amounts of 5’ polyphosphatase-treated and non-treated mitochondrial RNAs (Table 2), and incubate both reactions at 16 °C for 12–16 h.\nRecover the two sets of self-ligated RNAs using the same kit as in step 4.2.\nNOTE: It should be noted that only a fraction of mitochondrial RNA will be self-ligated, and the recovered RNA will be a mixture of linear and circularized transcripts.\nRepeat steps 3.3 to 3.5.\n6. Reverse Transcription",
    "Synthesize two sets of cDNAs from the same amounts of circularized 5’ polyphosphatase-treated and non-treated RNAs (200 ng).\nPrepare a primer mixture by adding an equal ratio of 26S-CRT and up to 7 other RT primers.\nNOTE: The final concentration of the primer mixture should be 1 μM.\nPrepare two pre-mixtures by combining the reagents listed in Table 3, incubate at 65 °C for 5 min, and then chill on ice for 2 min.\nAssemble two RT reaction systems (Table 4), and incubate them at 42 °C for 50 min.\nHeat both RT reactions at 70 °C for 5 min, and then chill them on ice.\n7. Normalization\nPrepare two PCR reactions by adding the same volume of template cDNAs derived from 5’ polyphosphatase-treated or non-treated RNAs, divergent primers flanking the 5’-3’ junction of circularized 26S rRNA (i.e. 26S-CF1 and -CR1), etc. (Table 5).\nRun the two reactions in a thermal cycler (Table of Materials) under conditions described in Table 6.\nPrepare one agarose gel composed of 1x TAE buffer, 1.0% agarose, and 1x nuclear staining dye.\nAdd 2 μL 10x loading buffer (0.5% bromophenol blue, 0.5% xylene cyanol FF, and 50% glycerol) to each of the two PCR products, and load them on the gel.\nRun the gel in 1x TAE buffer at 5–6 V/cm for 30–40 min, and image it using the same gel documentation system as step 3.5.\nCompare the abundance of the two PCR products using computer software (Table of Materials, Figure 4A), and optimize the normalization by changing the amounts of template cDNAs if necessary.\n8. PCR Amplification\nPrepare pairs of PCR reactions by adding appropriate volume of the normalized cDNAs and a pair of divergent primers flanking 5’-3’ junction of the target transcripts (Table 7).",
    "NOTE: The amount of template cDNAs used for PCR amplification of the target transcripts are determined by the 26S rRNA normalization results.\nPerform the PCR reactions according to the program described in Table 8.\nRepeat steps 7.3 to 7.5.\nChange to nested divergent primers, and verify the first round PCR results by repeating steps 8.1 and 8.2.\nRepeat steps 7.3 to 7.5.\nRecover the prominent bands that could be repeated in two rounds of PCR amplification using a gel DNA recovery kit (Table of Materials).\n9. Determination of Transcript Termini\nClone the gel-purified PCR products into a blunt-end vector (Table of Materials) using standard techniques.\nPerform colony PCR to select positive clones containing the target inserts, and sequence them commercially.\nNOTE: Positive clones containing inserts with variable size are usually detected from a single recovered band because many steady-state transcripts in plant mitochondrial have heterogeneous 5’ and/or 3’ ends1,12.\nAlign the sequencing data with maize mitochondrial genome using basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) of national center for biotechnology information (NCBI). Choose organism “maize (taxid:4577)”, and search database “Nucleotide collection (nr/nt)”.\nFind the 5’-3’ junction of the circularized transcript, and determine the positions of 5’ and 3’ transcript termini.\nCalculate the size of target transcripts.\n10. Verification of the cRT-PCR Mapping Results by RNA Gel Blot Hybridization\nNOTE: RNA gel blot hybridization is performed by using a commercial kit (Table of Materials), which contains the reagents for transcription-labeling of RNA with digoxigenin (DIG) and T7 RNA polymerase, hybridization, and immunological detection. Please refer to the protocols provided in this kit for more details. Make sure that only RNase free equipment is used for the whole procedure.",
    "Amplify the DNA fragment used to prepare RNA probe, and clone it to the same vector as in step 9.1, which contains a T7 promoter 17 bp upstream of the insertion site.\nLinearize the construct using proper restriction enzyme, recover the linearized plasmid by a DNA purification kit (Table of Materials), and dissolve it in DEPC-treated deionized H2O.\nLabel RNA probes with DIG-11-UTP by a commercial kit (Table of Materials) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nPrepare 500 mL of 10x MOPS buffer (0.2 M MOPS, 50 mM sodium acetate, and 10 mM EDTA) using DEPC-treated deionized H2O. Adjust to pH 7.0 by NaOH, and sterilize by filtration.\nAdd 2–3 volumes of loading buffer (50% formamide, 6.2% formaldehyde, 1x MOPS, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% bromophenol blue) to the mitochondrial RNA prepared in steps 3.1­–3.3.\nDenature the RNA sample/Loading buffer mixture at 65 °C for 10 min, and then chill on ice for 1 min.\nPrepare a denatured agarose gel (2% formaldehyde, 1.2% agarose, and 1x MOPS), and load the RNA sample/Loading buffer mixture to the gel (1–2 μg mitochondrial RNA per well).\nRun the gel in 1x MOPS at 3–4 V/cm for ~4 h.\nPrepare 2 L of 20x SSC (3 M NaCl, 0.3 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0). Treat it with 0.1% DEPC overnight, and sterilize by autoclave.\nRinse the gel twice in 20x SSC (15 min each time), and transfer gel RNA to a nylon membrane (Table of Materials) by capillary transfer with 20x SSC for 10–16 h.\nFix the RNA to membrane by baking at 120 °C for 30 min.\nPerform RNA hybridization and immunological detection with a commercial kit (Table of Materials) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.\n11. Discrimination of Primary and Processed 5’ Ends",
    "Discriminate the primary and processed 5’ ends by comparing the cRT-PCR products obtained from the normalized 5’ polyphosphatase-treated and non-treated RNAs.\nNOTE: To primary transcripts, the abundance of PCR products from 5’ polyphosphatase-treated RNA is much higher than that from non-treated counterpart (Figure 1, ‘Gene A,’ and Figure 4A). However, to processed transcripts, a comparable level of PCR products would be amplified from the two sets of mitochondrial RNAs (Figure 1, ‘Gene B’).\nDesign RT-qPCR primers based on the cRT-PCR mapping results.\nVerify the cRT-PCR discrimination results by RT-qPCR.\nNOTE: The two cDNA samples derived from 5’ polyphosphatase-treated and non-treated RNAs are normalized by the RT-qPCR products of 26S mature rRNA.\nSubscription Required.
