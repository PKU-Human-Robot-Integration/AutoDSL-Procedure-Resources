    "This protocol identifies cellular components in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples, as is typical for banked clinical patient samples. Paraffin embedding allows for the best maintenance of cellular and tissue morphology as well as has better longevity of sections. The samples used for this analysis were accessed through the University of Virginia Biorepository and Tissue Research Facility. Patient samples were selected by a neuropathologist based on a definitive diagnosis of glioblastoma (astrocytoma, WHO grade IV) who had completed tumor resections at the University of Virginia between 2010 and 2013, and were de-identified prior to this analysis11.\n1. FFPE Sample Deparaffinization and Rehydration\nNOTE: This portion of the protocol is specific to FFPE samples. While paraffin-embedded samples can be more useful for this analysis because of the preservation of cellular and tissue morphology, this analysis can also be done with frozen sections. If using frozen sections, this portion can be omitted and proceed directly to chromogenic immunohistochemistry.\nPerform the following washes for 5 min each: Xylene, Xylene, 100% Ethanol, 100% Ethanol, 95% Ethanol, 95% Ethanol, 70% Ethanol, Deionized water, Deionized water\n2. Antigen Retrieval\nNOTE: This portion of the protocol is necessary to break methylene bridges formed during formalin fixation of FFPE samples and expose antigen sites for antibodies to bind.\nDilute Tris-based high pH antigen unmasking solution at manufacturer recommendation in distilled water.\nPerform heat-mediated antigen retrieval using a microwave. Other forms of heat-mediated retrieval (such as pressure cooker, vegetable steamer, or boiling water) would also suffice.\n\t\nAdd the diluted unmasking solution into a non-sealed microwaveable vessel. Place slides into vessel. Place slides into microwave.\nBoil for 20 min at high power. Monitor liquid levels for evaporation, and replenish with distilled water as necessary.\nAllow samples to cool in solution for 1 h at room temperature.\n3. Chromogenic Immunohistochemistry",
    "Outline tissue sample with a hydrophobic pen to minimize volume of reagents necessary to cover sample.\n\tNOTE: Be sure to keep tissue samples hydrated and do not let them dry out as this will affect staining efficacy.\nPipet enough permeabilization solution (Tris-buffered saline (TBS) + 0.01% Triton-X) to cover tissue sample (typically about 100 - 200 µL).\nRemove and discard solution and repeat step 3.2.\nIncubate samples at room temperature with blocking solution (2.5% horse serum + permeabilization solution).\nIncubate samples overnight in 4 ºC with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution.\n\tNOTE: All primary antibodies used here are diluted at 1:200, but optimal dilutions can be determined using serial dilutions starting with manufacturer recommendation. Detailed information on antibodies used in this protocol was previously published11.\nDetect primary antibodies using a horseradish peroxidase polymer reagent corresponding with the primary antibody host animal, following manufacturer protocol.\nPipet enough permeabilization solution to cover tissue sample and incubate for 5 min.\nRemove and discard solution and repeat Step 3.7.\nIncubate slides in 0.3% H2O2 in 1x TBS for 15 min.\nDevelop samples with a peroxidase diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate for 2 - 10 min until desired stain intensity is achieved.\nCounterstain samples to identify cell nuclei, such as with hematoxylin, following manufacturer protocol.\nDehydrate samples with 100% ethanol and xylene.\nMount samples permanently with mounting media.\n4. Regions of Interest Identification\nImage slides under brightfield microscopy capable of high resolution images.\n\tNOTE: Use imaging cellular components at a minimum of 20x resolution.\nMove camera to specific regions of interest throughout tissue samples.\nSave images as TIFF files for quantification.\n5. Image Analysis\nOpen images in ImageJ for quantification of percent coverage.\nUse the Threshold Colour plugin to remove purple color from hematoxylin stained nuclei.\nConvert image to 8-bit.\nAdd threshold without dark background.",
    "Process image using one of the 17 pre-loaded ImageJ threshold filters (i.e. MaxEntropy) so only DAB stained portions are included in the threshold.\n\tNOTE: Select the optimal pre-loaded threshold filter that minimizes inclusion of background staining. This can depend on the quality of staining and specificity of antibody. Use the same threshold for all technical replicates within each patient sample.\nApply threshold.\nMeasure percent area of thresholded image.\nAverage percent area coverage for multiple regions within each sample.\nSubscription Required.
