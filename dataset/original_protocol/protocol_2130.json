    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCell transfection\nTiming: ∼2–3 days\nPreparation of PDL-coated 18 mm Ø coverslips.\nCoat 18 mm Ø glass coverslips with 10 mg/mL PDL solution overnight (8–12 h) at 4°C.\nRemove the PDL solution and wash the coverslips three times with PBS or sterilized water.\nStore the coverslips in sterilized PBS or water at 4°C (use within 1 week) for future use.\nCritical: The coverslips coated with PDL work well for HEK293, HeLa, COS1, human fibroblasts, MeWo, and melanocytes, however, alternative coating reagents (collagen, gelatin, Matrigel, etc.) could be used as well if PDL is unable to produce good attachment or if toxic for certain types of cells. In addition, the coating protocol (such as reagent concentration, coating time, etc.) should be optimized accordingly for different cell types. Seed the cells in a 12-well plate. Each well contained a pre-coated coverslip and was filled with 1 mL cell culture medium. The typical seeding cell number per well for MeWo cells is ∼2 × 105. Users should optimize the seeding protocol according to the doubling time of different cell types.\nNote: Transfection approach varies between different cell types. You may use any transfection reagents that work best for your cells.\nCheck cell shape (adherent, fibroblast-like) and confluence (60%–70%). Transfect MeWo cells with 1 μg GZnP3-ML1 (conjugation of GZnP3 onto the N-terminus of ML1) or 1 μg mCherry-ML1 + 1 μg GZnP3 (given the GZnP3-ML1 plasmid is not available) using Lipofectamine 2000.\nFor each well:\nAdd 100 μL Opti-MEM each in two 1.5 mL tubes.\nAdd 4 μL Lipofectamine 2000 to one tube and incubate the mixture at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 5 min.",
    "Add 1 μg GZnP3-ML1 plasmid (or 1 μg mcherry-ML1 + 1 μg GZnP3) to the other tube and incubate the mixture at 20°C–25°C for 5 min.\nMix the contents of the two tubes gently and incubate them at 20°C–25°C for 20 min.\nReplace old culture medium of MeWo cells with 300 μL fresh culture medium.\nGently drop the DNA & Lipofectamine mixture onto the cells.\nIncubate the cells in a 37°C 5% CO2 incubator for 4–6 h.\nDiscard all medium (∼ 500 μL) from the well, wash twice with 1 mL PBS and add 1 mL fresh warmed cell culture medium.\nCells are ready for imaging 48 h post transfection.\nNote: Both GZnP3 (the fluorescent Zn2+ indicator) and ML1 (the lysosomal Zn2+-release channel) are required here for imaging lysosomal Zn2+ release, thus the cells can be either transfected with GZnP3-ML1 or alternatively co-transfected with GZnP3 and ML1.\nCritical: All GZnP3, ML1 and GZnP3-ML1 are constructed on a pcDNA3.1 backbone with a CMV promoter, which can guarantee a robust gene expression. You can also check the availability of GZnP3 indicator within the cells by imaging (please refer to step 7. In situ response of GZnP3 to Zn2+ chelation and saturation for details).\nImage acquisition\nTiming: 20 min per assay/coverslip",
    "The EasyRatioPro imaging system (HORIBA) is used for fluorescence imaging of live cells. As shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], this system consists of an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX71, Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) equipped with a CoolSnap HQ2 camera (pixel resolution 1392 × 1040, Photometrics, Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B), a DeltaRam™ X monochromator (Photon Technology International, Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C), and a LPS220B power supply (Photon Technology International). The DeltaRam™ X compact rapid switching monochromator allows virtually infinite excitation wavelengths from 250 to 650 nm. The system is automatically controlled by the EasyRatioPro software (ver 1.12.121.86). Acquisition rate could be set for continuous imaging (up to 250 frames/s for dual excitation or 1000 frames/s for dual emission measurements) or to specified intervals. The images are acquired using a 20× objective lens (Olympus). The experiment is usually carried out at room temperature, while a temperature control device could be used if needed.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1715-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Hardware setup of the EasyRatio Pro Imaging system\n(A–E) General view of the entire imaging system which consists of a microscope (A), a camera (B), a monochromator (C), a perfusion system (D) and a metal perfusion chamber (E).",
    "A perfusion system (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D) is utilized for the solution application to a metal perfusion chamber (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E), which is customized to hold a Ø 18 mm glass coverslip. Alternatively, a 35 mm imaging dishes (MatTek) can be used without metal chamber. The perfusion system here is manually established by connecting the syringes as fluid reservoirs (10 mL or 60 mL, Corning), PE tubing (Warner Instruments, Cat. No. 64-0756), 3-way Luer locks (Baxter, Cat. No. 2C6241), roller clamps (Merit Medical, Cat. No. 700022001), and a perfusion manifold (Warner Instruments, Cat. No. 64-0211). This perfusion system uses gravity force to drive the solution flux, so the height level of the syringe bottom should be above of the perfusion manifold and the metal chamber. Manifold should be chosen with input ports to match the number of tubes to be connected. Input and output tubing are inserted with a friction fit. Roller clamps can be used to adjust the flow speed if needed. The metal perfusion chamber has two grooves to accommodate both the manifold tip (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E, on the left) and the outlet pipe (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E, on the right) to avoid direct flush onto the cells. The outlet pipe is connected with a liquid collection flask and a vacuum pump to collect waste solutions (also prevent the overflow within the perfusion chamber).\nPreparation of the cells and the recording setup. Warm up the imaging buffer (Tyrode’s solution) to (20°C–25°C). Prepare ML-SA1 working solution (50 μM in Tyrode’s solution). Load all the solutions into the fluid reservoirs.\nPut a coverslip with cells in the metal perfusion chamber, fill the chamber with the Tyrode’s solution (∼0.2 mL) and mount it on the inverted microscope.\nNote: Make sure the coverslip is aligned and the chamber is screwed on securely to prevent any liquid leakage.",
    "Note: The microscope must be capable of exciting and recording mCherry fluorescence (if the cells are transfected with mCherry-ML1; i.e., 561 nm excitation, 605 nm emission) and GZnP3 fluorescence (i.e., 488 nm excitation, 525 nm emission).\nPrepare the perfusion system, adjust the inflow speed to a rate of 50–60 drops/min. Adjust the outflow speed accordingly to avoid overflow or dry out the cells.\nTurn on the imaging system step by step as follows:\nTurn on all the power switches.\nTurn on the DeltaRam-X monochromator.\nTurn on the camera.\nTurn on the computer/workstation, open the EasyRatioPro software (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1715-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. EasyRatio Pro software setup\n(A) General overview of the EasyRatio Pro software.\n(B) “GRAPH” window.\n(C) “CHANNELS” window.\n(D) “IMAGE” window.\n(E) “TRANSPORT CONTROLS” window.\nTurn off the room lights. The experiment should be performed in a dark environment to reduce background noise signals.\nCritical: The perfusion speed should be carefully controlled to avoid the washout of cells (Problem 1).\nNote: It is necessary to clean the perfusion system with ethanol to avoid the contamination of residual drugs from previous experiments.\nNote: Allow the solutions flow through entire perfusion system and ensure no air bubble arises. All the solution reservoirs (10 mL or 60 mL syringes) should be filled with a solution or ddH2O to avoid back-flow or air bubbles.\nNote: ML-SA1 is used to activate ML1 to release Zn2+ from the lysosomal lumen to the cytosol. Pyrithione, a Zn2+ ionophore, or TPEN, a Zn2+ chelator, can serve as the controls to confirm the availability of GZnP3 indicator (please refer to step 7. In situ response of GZnP3 to Zn2+ chelation and saturation for details).\nImage acquisition.",
    "In the EasyRatioPro program (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A), select GFP on the top menu, set up the channel for excitation at 488 nm (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nIn the CHANNELS window, click the “R” and the “GFP” button at the bottom (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nIn the IMAGE window, choose RAINBOW in PALETTE. Adjust gain and exposure time to obtain low but visible basal fluorescent signals. Set the read interval of each frame per 1–20 s, for MeWo cells, we used 3 s interval (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nClick the “RECORD” button in the TRANSPORT CONTROLS window, the monochromator will start working (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nChoose a ROI (Region of Interest) selector in the IMAGE window. Circle out the cell to show the intensity curves in Graph window (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], “E1”).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1715-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Software demonstration of the imaging of GZnP3 signal in MeWo cells expressing GZnP3-ML1\nUpper panel, a representative image recorded from the cell (E1).\nLower panel, time series of fluorescent emission changes in the “GRAPH” window from the circled cell (E1).\nClick PLAY button in the TRANSPORT CONTROL window. The changes of GFP fluorescent signals will be recorded. Record baseline for at least 3 min, then add ML-SA1 (50 μM) to induce the lysosomal Zn2+ release. An example of an experimental setting showing the basal GZnP3 fluorescence and the fluorescence emission intensity trace of one MeWo cell upon ML-SA1 treatment (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], lower panel).\nNote: The fluorescent stability of GZnP3 is great, so it could be used for long-term (hours) recording at different acquiring interval. However, cells under long-term exposure to ambient environment could become unhealthy, so additional temperature-controlled device and 5% CO2 environment may be required.",
    "After the recording is complete, remove the imaging chamber, discard the coverslip, wash the chamber thoroughly (to get rid of any residual chemicals), prepare the next coverslip, and repeat the imaging steps. Datasets are processed and analyzed with ImageJ (please refer to step 6. Quantification and image analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.3] for details).\nCritical: To support the claim that ML-SA1 evoked GZnP3 signal is due to lysosomal Zn2+ release upon ML1 activation (cautiousness given to the cells that are not imaged in Zn2+, Ca2+ free HBSS), additional control experiments are required. Here we are offering two control experiments that can be used, please refer to the details in Du, et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] and Minckley, et al. (2019)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]:\nControl experiments (optional).\nUse FluoZin-3 AM (a cell permeable Zn2+-selective indicator, Kd=15 nM) and LysoTracker (a fluorescent dye broadly used to label lysosomes) to stain the cells, then challenge the cells with ML-SAs. Later, fluorescent images can be obtained and statistical analysis of the FluoZin-3 fluorescent intensity are performed to show ML-SA-induced lysosomal FluoZin-3 signal decrease, supporting lysosomal Zn2+ release into the cytosol upon ML1 activation.\nGlycyl-L-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamide (GPN, a cathepsin C substrate that induces osmotic lysis of lysosomes) can be used to deplete lysosomal Zn2+ storage. GPN pre-treatment (200 μM) of cells largely abolishes or reduces the changes of GZnP3 signals upon ML-SA1 treatment, suggesting ML-SA-evoked GZnP3 signals are attributed to lysosomal Zn2+ release.\nQuantification and image analysis\nTiming: 15–30 min\nFluorescence should be normalized to the baseline fluorescence (F0, the baseline fluorescent intensity of GZnP3 prior to ML-SA1 treatment) indicated as ΔF/F0. This equation is defined below, where F is the fluorescence intensity of GZnP3.\n    Δ F   F 0   =   F −  F 0    F 0",
    "Plot the time on the x-axis and ΔF/F0 on the y-axis to observe changes in GZnP3 fluorescence over time.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1715-Fx4.jpg\nHere we include a detailed image analysis of a MeWo cell as an example:\nUse ImageJ to analyze GZnP3 fluorescence. Export the session data as an Excel file (Table above is an example for one MeWo cell. X is time in second. Y is GZnP3 fluorescence intensity (F)).\nThe dataset contains the F at every recording time-point for the cell. Average the F from the time points before the application of ML-SA1 to get the baseline fluorescent intensity of GZnP3 (F0) for the cell. Use the equation (step 6) to calculate the ΔF/F0 for individual time point. Plot the time points on the x-axis and their corresponding ΔF/F0 on y-axis to reveal the changes of GZnP3 signals over time. Average ΔF/F0 from all recorded cells to generate an average time series of ΔF/F0. In OriginPro, plot the time on the x-axis and the average ΔF/F0 on the y-axis to observe the GZnP3 responses of all the recorded cells over time (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1715-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Representative GZnP3 signals in HeLa cells treated with 100 μM TPEN at 0 s, washed three times with Zn2+, Ca2+ free HBSS, then treated with 100 μM ZnCl2 and 2.5 μM pyrithione at 300 s.\nNote: For most of the cells that are transfected with either GZnP3-ML1 alone or co-transfected with mCherry-ML1 and GZnP3 together, 48 h should be enough for the exogenous protein expression (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). Here, we are providing a step-by-step method to validate the GZnP3 indicator expression in the transfected cells. This section can be also used as a control template to test your microscope system and GZnP3 responses in your cells.\nPreparation of imaging buffer with 100 μM Zn2+\nTiming: 15–30 min\nMake a 1 M intermediate stock solution of ZnCl2 with ddH2O in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nCritical: 1 M ZnCl2 will start to precipitate quickly (∼1 h), so it is important to make this solution fresh and use it immediately.\nAdd 5 μL 1 M ZnCl2 to 50 mL imaging buffer (Zn2+, Ca2+ free HBSS) to get 100 μM Zn2+ HBSS.\nStore long term (1 month) at 4°C and short term (1 week) at room temperature (20°C–25°C).

Image acquisition and drug treatment.\nMount the imaging chamber on the inverted microscope.\nThe microscope must be capable of exciting and recording GZnP3 fluorescence (i.e., 488 nm excitation, 525 nm emission).\nAcquire images using a CCD camera, every 10–20 s.\nRecord baseline GZnP3 fluorescence for 3–5 min to ensure stable sensor fluorescence, then add either ML-SA1 to open lysosomal ML1 channel (cause lysosomal Zn2+ release), or 100 μM TPEN to chelate Zn2+ from the GZnP3 indicator, bringing it to its minimum-fluorescent apo-state (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A–5D).\nAs shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]F, the cells are incubated with TPEN for 5 min, then washed 3 times with Zn2+, Ca2+ free HBSS.\nAdd 100 μM Zn2+ HBSS (with 2.5 μM pyrithione) to influx Zn2+ and saturate the GZnP3 indicator to its fluorescent maximum.\nAfter the recording is complete, use ImageJ to analyze GZnP3 fluorescence (please refer to step 6.
