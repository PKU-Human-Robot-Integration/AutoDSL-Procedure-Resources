Skeletal muscle injury is induced by intramuscular injection of notexin (NTX), a snake venom toxin that causes myotoxic damage.28[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28] If MuSC number and cell morphology in steady state conditions is desired, then the muscle injury can be omitted.\nOptional: Inject notexin (NTX) to Pax7EGFP mice for skeletal muscle injury.\nAnesthetize Pax7EGFP mice with isoflurane in an anesthesia induction chamber.\nAfter the mouse is fully sedated, transfer the mouse to a flat surface and position the nose cone around the snout and mouth of the mouse to keep it anesthetized.\nShave the hair off the hindlimb with an Electric Razor.\nWipe the hindlimbs of the mice with ethanol wipes.\nInject 10 μL (10 μg/mL) of NTX diluted in PBS intramuscularly into the tibialis anterior muscle at one site per muscle (10 μL per muscle). The needle for injection should first poke through the fascia but then stay at the top of the muscle.\nCritical: The needle can be inserted at approximately 45°. The injury should be close to the top of the muscle for easier visualization by two-photon microscopy. Otherwise, the signal intensity of cells within the injury and second harmonics of the fiber start to disappear at about 400 μm.\nAllow the mice to recover post-injury depending on the desired time frame after injury.\nFollowing IACUC guidelines, euthanize Pax7EGFP mice.\nCollect tibialis anterior (TA) muscle from uninjured and injured Pax7EGFP mice.\nPosition the mouse spine on a Styrofoam dissection board, secure limbs with a 21G needle, and spray the mouse with 70% (vol/vol) ethanol.",
    "Use forceps to pinch the center of the mouse belly skin and cut an opening horizontally. Peel off the leg skin by pulling the opening in opposite directions.\nCarefully remove the fascia and use sharp forceps to expose the underneath TA muscle.\nRun the sharp tip of the forceps underneath the TA muscle to detach the muscle from the tibia.\nCut the distal TA tendon, and while holding it, use a dissection scissor to cut the muscle along the longitudinal line of the TA muscle. Carefully remove TA at its proximal attachment.\nPlace the muscle in a 6 cm dish containing 4% paraformaldehyde/1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer on ice.\nWrap the 6 cm dish containing TA muscles with aluminum foil.\nNote: The aluminum foil is used to protect samples containing internal fluorescence from too much light exposure before imaging.\nPlace the 6 cm dish in an orbital shaker in the cold room (4°). Leave the TA samples in their current condition for 2 h to fix the muscle samples.\nNote: Fixation at 4 degree is recommended to better preserve fluorescence intensity and reduce background fluorescence. Too long fixation time (longer than 4 h for TA muscle) will quench the green fluorescent protein signal.\nAfter fixation, aspirate 4% paraformaldehyde from the 6 cm dish and wash the muscles with 3 mL of 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 3 times.\nPreserve the muscles in 3 mL of 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nPause point: The muscles can be preserved in PBS in the cold room for weeks before imaging.\nNote: Too long cold room storage will cause increased autofluorescence. It is recommended to image the tissue as soon as possible and within 1–3 weeks after fixation to minimize the potential differences in fluorescence intensity.\nImaging chamber preparation\nTiming: <1 h",
    "Fixed muscles were mounted on a custom-made polycarbonate chamber and immersed in 1× PBS, and a coverslip was lowered from the top to close the chamber.\nCreate a polycarbonate window with the following dimensions: Length: 25 mm, Width: 25 mm, Height: 3 mm or 3.5 mm, width between inner and outer square: 5 mm (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3190-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. The process of tibias anterior (TA) muscle embedding for two-photon microscopy\n(A) Dimensions of custom-made polycarbonate chamber.\n(B–E) Key steps for creating chamber.\n(F and G) Steps of TA muscle embedding.\nCut a piece of filter paper based on the size of the inner square (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nApply Elmer’s rubber cement to the back of the polycarbonate window (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C) and attach the window to the plus slide of the Superfrost plus microscopy slide to create a polycarbonate chamber (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nPlace the obtained filter paper inside the chamber (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E) to decrease the movement of muscle samples relative to the chamber.\nUse forceps to place one TA muscle inside the chamber carefully (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nApply Elmer’s rubber cement to the top of the polycarbonate window to glue the coverslip to the window.\nUse transfer pipets to fill the polycarbonate chamber with 1× PBS.\nCarefully lower the cover glass on top of the window to close the chamber (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).\nUse the sharp tip of the forceps to push gently on top of the cover glass and use Kim Wipe to remove excess mounting media (1× PBS). The whole setup is finished and ready for two-photon imaging.",
    "Note: The current imaging chamber setup is used for upright microscope. If inverted microscope is used, the imaging chamber setup would be a little different: keep steps 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, and 21, and skip steps 15 and 17. For step 18, place the TA muscle upside down, so that the anterior of the muscle faced down, and use Elmer’s rubber cement to attach the muscle to the Superfrost plus microscope slide to decrease the movement of muscle samples relative to the polycarbonate chamber.\nTwo-photon ex vivo imaging\nTiming: 3–4 h per sample\nPerform two-photon imaging of whole-mount uninjured or injured TA muscle and visualize the structure of interest. This should be specific to each research group. In our case, we image muscle fiber with second harmonics (SHG) and muscle stem cells expressing green fluorescent proteins in Pax7EGFP mice.\nTurn on the microscope controller, confocal unit, Leica software (LAS X), PC, and tunable multiphoton (MP) laser for imaging.\nMove the motorized stage from the preparation area to the imaging area. Place the chamber containing the muscle sample on the motorized stage. Adjust the XY position of the microscope motorized platform so that the muscle sample is directly underneath the lens and secure the chamber by tightening the screw (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3190-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Deposit distilled water on top of the coverslip for the water-immersion lens.\nAdjust the height of the lens to find focus (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nTurn off room lights, turn on wide-field epifluorescence, and use the eyepiece to find focus. troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: To avoid bleaching, keep the epifluorescence at the lowest power.\nTurn off the epifluorescence shutter and cover the microscope with a blackout chamber or blackout cloth (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nNote: Avoid intense light from surrounding to enter the microscope.\nTurn on the MP laser shutter. Set the laser wavelength at 910 nm for green fluorophore and SHG.\nSelect the imaging area and conditions. troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nSet the laser power at 13% for a start.\nSet the detector gain to 100%. If the signal remains low, slowly increase the laser power.\nTurn on tilescan and z-stack and adjust XYZ position to find the field of interest where muscle stem cells are visible and lower than the collagen deposition layer.\nSet scan settings of LAS X (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C–2E).\nFormat 1024 × 1024.\nSpeed: 400 Hz.\nBidirectional: ON Phase X: −33.04.\nZoom factor: 1.5.\nImage size: 369.05 μm × 369.05 μm, Pixel Size 360.75 μm × 360.75 μm.\nLine Average: 2.\nTilescan field size: 3 × 4; merge images by advanced statistical stitching.\nSet the upper limits of a z-stack, ensuring the upper limits are lower than the collagen deposition layer. Set lower limits of a z-stack before the muscle cell signal disappears. Start the z-stack acquisition with the 1 or 1.5 μm step size.\nNote: It usually takes two hours to finish scanning for an image with a z-stack about 100 μm in-depth and tilescan with field size 3 × 4.\nSave the original file (lif format) to a hard drive for further data analysis.",
    "Pause point: Image analysis can be conducted at any time after the imaging.\nImage analysis using Fiji software\nTiming: 5–8 h per image\nAcquired optical sections from two-photon microscopy are analyzed in Fiji software. To define the muscle stem cell (MuSC) number in the TA muscle, acquired optical sections are stacked in Fiji, and MuSCs are counted and normalized to the volume stacked. To quantify the length and number of the protrusions of MuSC, minimum 100 MuSCs per image should be analyzed using the Simple Neurite Tracer (SNT) plugin in Fiji. MuSC circularity/aspect ratio, circularity, and orientation ratio are measured using set measurements and the angle tool in Fiji. Cells are defined as misaligned with myofiber if the angle between the cell body and myofiber is greater than a 15-degree angle, and the ratio is calculated as the number of cells misaligned divided by the total number of cells per cell type.\nLoad the original image into Fiji software (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) using File > Open (choose split channels) and save the image as tiff format using File > Save as > tiff.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3190-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

If the angle is larger than a 15-degree, the cell is considered as misaligned with the fiber. The misaligned ratio is calculated as the number of cells misaligned divided by the total number of cells per cell type.\nDownload the Neuroanatomy plugin to Fiji software for measurement of protrusion length by update function.\nOpen the Neuroanatomy plugin and load the numbered tiff file by:\nPlugins > Neuroanatomy >SNT > select numbered tiff file as the image file\nSelect only XY view in the user interface.\nSelect the path of protrusions and obtain individual protrusion protrusions by:\nMove along the Z direction and click at the beginning and the end of each protrusion to create a protrusion path.\nIn the Path Manager, click on the path and obtain protrusion by Tag > Morphometry > Length.\nExport data to copy into Excel to the corresponding cell number.",
    "Note: In quiescence, MuSCs could have 0–9 protrusions. We have described in detail the morphological and functional properties for each MuSC subtype in Ma et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] Based on the starting position of the protrusions, this imaging protocol allows for further characterization as follows:\nPrimary protrusions: extruding from the cell body.\nSecondary protrusions: branching from Primary protrusions.\nTertiary protrusions: branching from secondary protrusions.\nQuaternary protrusions: branching from tertiary protrusions.\nSecondary, Tertiary, and Quaternary protrusions are called branches. Branches should be marked in the Excel file.\nTo calculate the number of MuSCs per volume, find a cuboid volume of the image that is filled with muscle fibers, calculate the volume and make a maximum projection, and count the total number of MuSCs in the cuboid, and calculate the final number of MuSCs per volume.\nFind an area full of fibers and use the rectangle tool to select and crop the region of interest.\nObtain dimensions by selecting Image > Show info > Width, Height, Z-step size (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3190-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.
