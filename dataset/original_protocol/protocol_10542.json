    "All experiments on animals were handled in accordance with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research, and the guidelines and regulations set forth by the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary Animal Care Committee.\nThe day before the experiment:\n1. Preparation of Tubing for Flow Chamber\nTo prepare the jugular side, connect 1 cm PE10 polyethylene tubing to 6 cm silicon tubing followed by 5 cm polyethylene tubing. For the carotid side, prepare similarly to the jugular side with the addition of a T-tube within the 6 cm silicon tubing about 1.5 cm away from the 1 cm polyethylene tubing (Figure 1A, B). In order to insert the T-tube, widen the silicon tube by using fine forceps if necessary.\nConnect one end of 10 cm of silicone tubing to the pressure transducer then insert the T end of the carotid side T-tube into the other end. Ensure the connection sites are tight and leak free. Apply a small rectangular piece of parafilm over where the tubing fits together, if necessary, to prevent leakage (Figure 1C).\n2. Coating the Chamber\nPrepare the endothelial surface coating protein (e.g., P selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion protein-1 (VCAM-1)) in 0.1% BSA. As a guideline, 1 μg of protein in 200 μl BSA is enough to coat 4-5 chambers. Using a 1 ml syringe connected to a 25 G needle, infuse each chamber (0.04 x 0.4 x 50 mm) with endothelial surface coating protein. Store the coated chambers in a 15 ml tube at 4 °C overnight.\nThe day of the experiment:\n3. Preparing the Chamber",
    "Remove the coated chambers from 4 °C and connect the jugular and carotid tubing to each side. Seal the connections by carefully stretching a small rectangular piece of parafilm over where the tubing meets the chamber. Using a syringe, fill the chamber and tubing with 0.1% BSA (check for leakage). Incubate for 45 min.\nPrepare a 35 mm Petri dish to hold the chamber by cutting notches on each side of the dish. Stabilize the chamber in the notches; then use a small drop of silicone to affix the chamber to the dish at the notched site. Make sure the chamber is level by looking under the microscope. Allow the silicone to dry for at least 15 min.\nFill a 60 ml locking syringe with heparin and connect to the pressure transducer. Connect the pressure transducer to the carotid tubing in the following order: Transducer, silicon tubing, and T-tube.\n\t\nUse a 1 cm PE50 between the silicon tubing connected to the transducer and the T-tube to secure the connection. Pass the carotid artery silicon tubing through the pressure clamp (Figure 1D). Run 100USP heparin through the tubing and chamber until there are no air bubbles.\n4. Setting up the Software\nTo prepare the software, turn on the computer, microscope, and open lab device. Double click on the Leica application suite (LAS) (or equivalent) and prepare a folder to save the video: browse → acquire → movie → define sequence of clips (clips = 15, recording time = 30 sec, and intervals = 15 sec) then click the “+” sign to confirm.\nTo record the flow pressure open the LabChart (or equivalent) file and coordinate the file name to the recording folder in step 4.1, above.\n5. Surgical Procedure",
    "Anesthetize an 8-10 week-old mouse using a combination of ketamine (60 mg/kg) and xylazine (6 mg/kg) injected intra-peritoneally (IP). Confirm that deep sedation is achieved within 5-10 min by loss of pedal withdrawal reflex. If necessary, isoflurane delivered via face mask can be given as needed.\nWhile under anesthesia, place a warming pad under the cage and set to 37 °C to maintain body temperature. Once proper anesthesia is confirmed, place the mouse in a ventral position and coat the eyes with bacitracin ointment to prevent ocular dryness.\nThereafter, shave the hair at the incision site using a razor blade and thoroughly clean the site with alcohol.\nOnce fully anesthetized secure the animal with tape keeping the mouse in a ventral position. Expose the neck area with scissors and remove the thyroid gland to expose the trachea and vessels (Figure 2A).\nClean the carotid artery until it is fully exposed taking care not to damage the vagus nerve (Figure 2B). Fold a piece of suture and pass the bend underneath the carotid artery then cut at the bend so there are now 2 pieces of suture underneath the carotid. Loop each suture into knots (do not tighten the knots).\nRepeat the same procedure to expose the left jugular vein (Figure 2C), preparing the sutures in the same manner (Figure 2D).\nConnect the tubing to the mouse vasculature.\n\t\nHeparinize the mouse by injecting 1 ml of heparin IP.\nTighten the upper suture on the carotid artery. Place the vessel clamp as low as it can go on the carotid artery (Figure 3A). Use forceps to hold the artery by the upper suture and make a small incision, about 1/8 of the circumference of the artery, using the microscissors (Figure 3B).",
    "Pass the carotid artery tubing through the second knot in the upper suture and into the incision made in the artery. Tie off the lower suture so that the artery is sealed around the tubing (several knots should be made to ensure a tight seal; Figure 3C).\nRepeat the same procedure for inserting the jugular vein tubing (the vessel clamp is not needed for the jugular side; Figure 3D).\nTest the flow by releasing the vessel clamp. If there are no leaks move the mouse to the microscope and connect the carotid tubing and jugular vein to the chamber tubing (see attached video for demonstration of surgical procedure).\n6. Recording Rolling Velocity\nOpen the carotid clamp to fill the chamber, making a circuit with the mouse circulatory system. Allow the blood to circulate for 3-5 min so that the flow conditions stabilize. During the waiting period of 3-5 min, adjust the microscope stage so that the chamber is level from one end to the other with the microscope objective and its edge is parallel with the video recording window on the screen.\nFill the modified Petri dish containing the glass chamber with water then lower the 10X water immersion objective into the dish so that the cells flowing through the chamber are visible. The light intensity may have to be adjusted for adequate viewing of the cells. Generally a lower intensity is better.\nAdjust the clamp on the tubing so that the transducer reads a steady 30 mm Hg, correlating to a medium physiological flow pressure, or as desired.\nPress “start” to initiate recording both the video and the pressure with the first time lapse close to the jugular end and moving against the flow toward the carotid end until completed.",
    "NOTE: Several coating conditions using different adhesion molecules can be studied in the same mouse by using multiple chambers. Only one chamber is recorded at a time.\n\t\nWhen recording is finished, close the valve at the input site, stopping the blood flow. Remove the chamber and fit a new chamber (coated with a different adhesion molecule) to the circuit using fine forceps in one hand and grooved forceps in the other hand. Resume recording for the new chamber as outlined in the steps 6.1-6.4.\nEuthanize all mice by CO2 asphyxiation followed by a spinal cord dislocation at the end of the experiment. The procedure is terminal, therefore, the mice are euthanized by a spinal cord dislocation at the end of the experiment.\n7. Interpreting the Results\nTo analyze the recorded data use the “M TrackJ” plugin for ImageJ software23.\nConvert the file to grayscale by Select file → import → AVI → convert to grayscale.\nStandardize the frames by Select → image → property → enter the frame intervals (i) → global. Calculate the frame intervals by dividing the total video duration (usually 30 sec) by the number of frames in one video (shown in the upper corner of the Image J video window).\nMeasure the flow of each leukocyte by Select plugin → M TrackJ → Add tracks → select a leukocyte → Track it with each frame for 15 - 20 sec → Merge.\nRepeat step 7.4 for all the leukocytes in view.\nDetermine the mean rolling velocity of the leukocytes by Select measure → two columns appear → Copy all of the M TrakJ:Tracks into a spreadsheet. The column labeled “mean V” is the leukocyte rolling measured in pixels/second. Convert into μm/sec by dividing by 2/3.",
    "To analyze the pressure data highlight and export into a spreadsheet and perform the following calculation: ΔP (mm Hg) and t (dyne/cm2) for a comparison between each experimental group. Once calculated, copy the data into prism software for graphing."
