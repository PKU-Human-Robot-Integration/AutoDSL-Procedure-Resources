    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nExcision of mouse plantaris muscle\nTiming: 5 min/mouse\nTo overload the plantaris muscle, tenotomy was performed according to the procedure described in our parallel STAR protocol (Kaneshige et al., 2022b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]), and the muscle was removed as described below.\nSacrifice the mouse (in our study, B6.129S4-Pdgfratm11(EGFP)Sor/J mice were used and hereafter referred to as ‘PDGFRαEGFP’) and peel off the skin to expose the lower leg muscles.\nCut the Achilles tendon of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles leaving the Achilles tendon of the plantaris muscle intact (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1867-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Excision and fixation of mouse plantaris muscle\n(A and B) Cutting the Achilles tendon of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles while leaving the Achilles tendon of the plantaris muscle intact.\n(C) Exposure of the plantaris muscle.\n(D) Cutting the Achilles tendon of the plantaris muscle.\n(E) Isolation of the whole plantaris muscle.\n(F) Pinning and fixation of the plantaris muscle.\n(G) The fixed muscle in the tube.\nPinch the Achilles tendon of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles by forceps and pull them away from the tibia to expose the plantaris muscle (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nCut the Achilles tendon of the plantaris muscle.\nPinch the Achilles tendon of the plantaris muscle by forceps and pull them away from the tibia (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nCut the proximal attachment site of the plantaris muscle to the femur and isolate the whole plantaris muscle (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nNote: Use heterozygous PDGFRαEGFP mice because homozygous for this knock-in allele is an embryonic lethal.\nNote: In PDGFRαEGFP mice, the H2B-eGFP fusion gene is expressed from the endogenous Pdgfra locus and mimics the expression pattern of the endogenous gene. Therefore, these mice are useful for the detection of PDGFRα(+) mesenchymal progenitors.\nFixation of mouse plantaris muscle\nTiming: 30 min",
    "Pour 4% PFA solution to silicone rubber plate and keep it on ice.\nImmerse the plantaris muscle in 4% PFA solution and pin both ends of plantaris muscle using intradermal needles as quickly as possible (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F). See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: problems 1 and 2.\nFix the muscle for 30 min on ice.\nAfter fixation, transfer the muscle to a 2.0 mL tube containing PBS (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).\nWash the muscle with PBS for 30 min three times.\nCritical: Pinning is required to preserve shape of muscle because muscles tend to curve if pinning is not performed during PFA fixation. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: problem 1.\nNote: For pinning the end of plantaris muscle, fine-tipped forceps are recommended.\nPause point: The fixed muscle can be stored in PBS at 4°C for up to 1 week.\nBlocking and whole-mount immunofluorescence staining\nTiming: 3 days\nThe main purpose of this step is to stain whole plantaris muscle using antibody specific for PDGFRα to visualize mesenchymal progenitors. PDGFRα is specifically expressed on the surface of mesenchymal progenitors and is a useful marker for the detection of mesenchymal progenitors (Uezumi et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nRemove PBS from the tube, add blocking solution to the tube, and then incubate the muscle in blocking solution (e.g., 500–600 μL) at 4°C for 12 h. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: problem 3.\nNote: Use enough volume of blocking solution to completely soak the muscle.\nRemove blocking solution from the tube, add goat polyclonal anti-mouse PDGFRα (final antibody concentration: 2.5 μg/mL) and rabbit monoclonal anti-YAP (1:100) diluted in blocking solution (e.g., 500–600 μL) to the tube, and incubate the muscle at 4°C for 12 h. A negative control sample that is not stained with the primary antibodies should also be prepared. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: problems 3 and 4.",
    "Critical: For whole-mount immunostaining, it is important to use a buffer containing a surfactant so that the antibody can access the antigen efficiently. We use blocking solution containing 1% Triton X-100 as an antibody diluent buffer. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: problems 2 and 3.\nNote: Use enough volume of primary antibody solution to completely soak the muscle.\nWash the muscle with PBS for 30 min three times.\nRemove PBS from the tube, add Alexa 647-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG and Alexa 594-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG diluted in the blocking solution (1:1000 dilution) to the tube, and incubate the muscle at 4°C for 12 h in the dark. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: problems 3 and 4.\nRemove secondary antibodies from the tube, add DAPI diluted in blocking solution (1:5000 dilution) to the tube, and incubate the muscle at 4°C for 10 min in the dark.\nWash the muscle with PBS for 30 min three times.\nNote: Use enough volume (e.g., 500–600 μL) of secondary antibody and DAPI solution to completely soak the muscle.\nNote: After secondary antibody staining, the sample should be protected from light.\nPause point: The stained muscle can be stored in PBS for up to 1 week at 4°C protecting from light.\nMounting stained muscle for confocal microscopy\nTiming: 10 min/muscle\nPlace the silicone rubber sheet on cover glass (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1867-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Mounting stained muscle for whole-mount imaging\n(A) Cover glass with silicone rubber sheet.\n(B) Muscle placed on the cover glass framed by silicone rubber sheet.\n(C) Muscle sandwiched between cover glass.\n(D) Schematic side cross-sectional view of mounted muscle.\nPlace the stained muscle on a cover glass and put a few drops of mounting medium on the muscle (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: We use SlowFade Diamond Antifade Mountant from Thermo Fisher Scientific but a similar antifade reagent can be used.",
    "Cover the sample with another cover glass (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nNote: Sandwiching the sample between cover glasses from the top and bottom enables microscopic imaging from both sides (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nPause point: The mounted specimen can be stored at 4°C protecting from light for up to 2 weeks.\nConfocal microscopy\nTiming: depending on number of samples\nThe main purpose of this step is to obtain z-stack images of the immunofluorescently stained whole muscle. For this purpose, a confocal laser scanning microscope is required. We only describe a general procedure for confocal microscopy here because detailed settings vary depending on the microscope used. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for detailed settings of each microscope.\nAdjust the laser power and detector gain to obtain the appropriate signal in each channel while using a negative control sample for the background settings.\nSet the start and end positions for z-stack imaging and determine the scan interval in the z-axis direction considering the optical resolution of the objective lens.\nCritical: For whole-mount observation, it is critical to use an objective lens with a working distance that adequately covers the depth of the sample to be observed.\nNote: We use a 40× oil-immersion objective lens but other magnification lenses can be used depending on the imaging purpose.\nNote: When taking z-stack images, first set the laser intensity to a sufficient level at the deepest part of the sample. Next, as you move the focus to the surface of the sample, check that the signal is not saturated at all depths. Some microscopes allow the laser intensity to be set in steps according to the sample depth, so it is useful to use this function.",
    "Note: In z-stack imaging, the sample is repeatedly exposed to excitation lasers and is therefore prone to fading. It is recommended to test the degree of fading of the fluorescent dyes in the sample using test sample.\nNote: The end position should be set at a depth of less than 50 μm from the muscle surface. See limitations[href=https://www.wicell.org#limitations].\nAcquire the z-stack images. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: problem 5.\nUsing an appropriate 3D imaging software, reconstruct the maximum intensity projection image.\nNote: We use the Leica TCS SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope system and the Leica LAS X software, but other confocal microscopes and the supplied 3D imaging software can also be used."
