    "All the procedures involving animals handling and tumor xenografts studies were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) here at the University of Virginia and conform to the relevant regulatory standards\n1. Expression and purification of antibodies\nMaintenance of CHO cells\n\t\nGrow CHO cells in FreeStyle CHO Media supplemented with commercially available 1x glutamine supplement at 37 ˚C shaking at 130 rpm with 5% CO2 using delong Erlenmeyer flasks either glass or disposable.\n\t\tNOTE: It is highly recommended to use a baffled flask with vented cap for increased agitation and to improve gas transfer during shaking condition. Significantly reduced antibody yield has been obtained with regular flasks (non-baffled) due to limited agitation of the suspension culture.\nMaintain the cell number between 1-5 x 106 cells/mL with >95% cell viability. If the cell number increases over 5 x 106 cells/mL, split the cells. Never allows CHO cells to reach below 0.2 x 106 cells/mL.\nTransfection of CHO cells\n\t\nGrow CHO cells in 200 mL of media (2 x 106 cells/mL) in delong Erlenmeyer baffled flasks.\n\t\tNOTE: Suspension cultures grown in baffled flasks have always produced higher protein yields vs when grown in non-baffled flasks.\nIn a 15 mL tube, take 5 mL of CHO FreeStyle media and add 50 μg of VH clone DNA and 75 μg of VL clone DNA. Vortex to mix well.\nIncubate the DNA mixture at room temperature for 5 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Longer incubation reduces the protein yields.\nAdd 750 μL of 1 mg/mL polyethyleneimine (PEI) stock to the DNA solution and aggressively vortex the mixture for 30 s. Incubate at room temperature for additional 5 min.\n\t\tNOTE: PEI must be made fresh. Multiple freeze thaw cycle of PEI reduces overall yield significantly.",
    "Add the entire mixture of DNA and PEI on the cells while manually shaking the flask. Immediately incubate the delong Erlenmeyer baffled flasks with cells at 37 ˚C shaking at 130 rpm.\nExpression\n\tNOTE: The antibody has secretory signal peptide engineered to its N-terminal end, which helps antibodies to be secreted out into the media.\n\t\nGrow the transfected cells at 37 ˚C, with shaking at 130 rpm on the Day 1.\nOn the Day 2, add 2 mL of 100x anti-clumping agent and 2 mL of 100x anti-bacterial-anti-mycotic solution. Shift the flask to lower temperature (32-34 ˚C), with shaking at 130 rpm.\nOn every fifth day, add 10 mL of Tryptone N1 feed, and 2 mL of 100x glutamine supplement.\nKeep counting the cells every third day using hemocytometer after staining an aliquot of cells with trypan blue stain. Ensure that the cell viability stay above 80%.\nOn the Day 10 or 11, harvest the medium for antibody purification. Spin the culture at 3000 x g, 4 ˚C for 40-60 min and then filter the clear media using 0.22 µM bottle filters.\nPurification\n\tNOTE: Antibody purification is performed using commercially available Protein-A column (see Table of Materials), using a peristaltic pump.\n\t\nEquilibrate the column with two column volume of binding buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate at pH 7.4).\nPass the filtered media containing antibody (obtained in step 1.3.5) through the column at the flow rate of 1 mL/min.\nWash the column with two-column volume of binding buffer.\nElute the antibody into 500 μL fractions using 5 mL elution buffer (30 mM sodium acetate at pH 3.4).\nNeutralize the pH of the eluted antibody by adding 10 μL of neutralization buffer (3 M sodium acetate at pH 9) per fraction.",
    "NOTE: Fraction number 3-6 contains most of the antibody. It is advisable to keep all the fractions in case the antibody is eluted in a later fraction than expected.\nMeasure the concentration of purified antibody using a spectrophotometer by selecting the default protocol for IgG. The final concentration of the antibody is obtained in mg/mL by considering the molecular weight and absorption coefficient.\n2. Fluorescent labeling\nNOTE: Antibodies are labeled with the infrared dye that contains an NHS ester reactive group, which couples to proteins and form a stable conjugate. This reaction is pH sensitive and works best at pH 8.5. Fluorescent conjugates labeled with the dye display an absorption maximum of 774 nm, and an emission maximum of 789 nm. pH 8.5 is key for effective conjugation.\nDialyze 0.5 mL of the antibody using a dialysis cassette (0.1-0.5 mL) in 1 L of conjugation buffer (50 mM phosphate buffer at pH 8.5). After 4 h transfer the dialysis cassette to fresh buffer and dialyze overnight.\nSetup a conjugation reaction by adding 0.03 mg of IRDye 800CW per 1 mg of antibody in a reaction volume of 500 μL.\n\tNOTE: IRDye 800CW is dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mg/mL.\nCarry out labeling reactions for 2 h at 20 °C.\n\tNOTE: Increasing time beyond 2 h does not improve the labeling.\nPurify labeled conjugates by extensive dialysis against 1x PBS.\nEstimate the degree of labeling by measuring the absorbance of the dye at 780 nm and absorbance of the protein at 280 nm. The dye contribution to the 280 nm signal is 3%.\nCalculate the dye/protein ratio using this formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60727/60727equ01.jpg",
    "where 0.03 is a correction factor for the absorbance of the dye used at 280 nm (equal to 3.0 % of its absorbance at 780 nm), εDye and εProtein are molar extinction coefficients for the dye and the protein (antibody) respectively.\n\tNOTE: εDye is 270,000 M-1 cm-1 and εProtein is 203,000 M-1 cm-1 (for a typical IgG) in 1:1 mixture of PBS: methanol. Proteins other than IgG may have very different molar extinction coefficients. Use of correct extinction coefficient for the protein of interest is essential for accurate determination of D/P ratio.\nCalculate the final protein concentration using this formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60727/60727equ02.jpg\n\tNOTE: Always confirm the antigen-binding efficacy of labeled and unlabeled antibody using ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay) or flow cytometry before proceeding to in vivo studies.\n3. Mouse xenograft studies\nPreparation of tumor cells for injection\n\t\nGrow OVCAR-3 cells in RPMI-1640 Medium, supplemented with 10% of FBS and 1x penicillin-streptomycin.\nThe day before the injection, subculture cells into new 100 mm culture dishes with 10 mL of complete medium/dish. Use cell number of 0.5-1 x 106 cells/dish.\nIncubate cultures at 37 °C temperature, 95% humidity and 5% CO2 for 20-24 h.\nOn the day of injection, remove the growth medium from culture dishes. Thoroughly rinse the cell layer with Ca2+/Mg2+ free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) to remove dead cells, cellular debris and all traces of serum, which may interfere in trypsin action.\nTrypsinize the cells by adding 1.0-1.5 mL of Trypsin-EDTA solution to each dish and try to spread the solution by tilting the dish all around followed by incubation at 37 °C for 5-10 min.",
    "NOTE: Observe cells under an inverted microscope to check the actual trypsinization status. Under trypsinization results in lower number of cell detachment from the surface of culture dish, over trypsinization induces cellular stress. So, proper trypsinization is important.\nAdd 1.0-1.5 mL of complete growth medium to each dish to stop the trypsin action, after that re-suspend cells by pipetting gently.\n\t\tNOTE: Gentle pipetting is important to maintain cell health.\nCollect the cell suspension into a 15 mL conical tube and spin at 250 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nCollect the cell pellet after removing the supernatant and wash the cells by re-suspending the pellet in 1x DPBS.\nSpin the cell suspension at low speed 250 x g for 5 min.\nAdd 500 µL of DPBS and re-suspend cells by gentle pipetting to get single cell suspension.\nCount cells using hemocytometer or automated cell counter.\n\t\tNOTE: For better accuracy, repeat the counting for three times and take an average.\nAdjust the volume in such a way so that the final cell density will be 1 x 108 cells/mL.\nSubcutaneous injection of cells to develop mouse xenografts\n\tNOTE: All procedures should be done in a BSL2 safety cabinet. Athymic Nude Foxn1nu/Foxn1+ mice have been used in the current study.\n\t\nTake 50 µL of the cell suspension into a 1.5 mL tube and mix with 50 µL of basement membrane matrix medium.\n\t\tNOTE: Basement membrane matrix medium tends to form a gel like state at room temperature, so carefully maintain the cells and the matrix medium mixture on ice. It is advisable to keep tubes, tips and syringes in the fridge and then transfer on ice prior to the animal injection.",
    "Agitate the mixture to avoid any cell clumping. Then, take this 100 µL of the cell suspension-matrix medium mixture that contains 5 x 106 cells, into a 1 cc syringe.\nGently lift the skin of the animal to separate the skin from the underlying muscle layer and slowly inject the cell suspension (100 µL) under the skin (5 x 106 cells), with a 26 G needle. Wait for a few seconds before taking the needle out, so that basement matrix medium can form the semi-solid gel like structure along with cells under the skin, preventing the mixture coming out from the site of injection.\n\t\tNOTE: Cells needs to be tested prior to injection for any contamination which may harm to immunodeficient mice. While injecting do not put the needle too deep into the skin as this may form the tumor deeper than expected.\nKeep the animal in a sterile cage and observe for around 20 min.\nObserve the mice for 2-3 weeks and allow the tumor to grow up to 500 mm3 size.\n4. Antibody localization using an in vivo imaging system\nNOTE: In vivo imaging equipment (see Table of Materials) used in this experiment uses a set of high efficiency filters and spectral un-mixing algorithms for noninvasive visualization and tracking of cellular and genetic activity within a living organism in real time. System provides both fluorescence and bioluminescence monitoring capability.\nInject 25 μg of dye labeled antibody via tail vein.\n\t\nAnesthetize tumor bearing mice using 2% isoflurane. Check for the lack of response to pedal reflexes.\nOnce mice stop moving, dilate the lateral tail vein by applying worm water.\nInject 25 μg (in 100 μL) of labeled antibody using 1 cc insulin syringe with a 26 G needle.",
    "Similarly, as a negative control, label and inject the non-specific IgG1 Isotype antibody which does not target cancer cells.\nPerform in vivo live imaging after 8, 24, 48 h, etc. of antibody injections.\n\t\nIn the associated software, click Initialize located in the control panel and confirm that the stage temperature is 37 °C.\nTurn on the oxygen supply, all the pumps on the anesthesia system, isoflurane gas supply to anesthetic chamber and set the isoflurane vaporizer valve to 2%.\nTransfer the mice to anesthetic chamber and wait till mice are completely anesthetized. Apply the eye lubricating ointment to avoid drying of their eyes.\nGo to the Control panel, set up the fluorescence imaging through the Imaging Wizard option and select the excitation at 773 nm and emission at 792 nm.\n\t\tNOTE: The default auto exposure settings provide a good fluorescent image. However, the auto exposure preferences can be modified as per the needs.\nTransfer the anesthetized mice into the imaging chamber and assemble it on the imaging field using nose cone. The imaging stage provides the option to accommodate 5 mice at a time.\n\t\tNOTE: Have control mice imaged along with the test mice to have a similar amount of exposure and other settings while analysis.\nOnce everything is ready, select Acquire option on the control panel for the image acquisition.\nWith Autoexposure settings the system generates the image within a minute. The generated image is the overlay of fluorescence on photographic image with optical fluorescence intensity displayed in units of counts or photons, or in terms of efficiency.\nAfter acquiring the image, transfer the mice from the imaging chamber back to their cage and observe for their recovery for 1 to 2 min.",
    "Fine tune the image further with the tools and functions provided within the software for image analysis. Image analysis tools are in the menu bar and tool palette.\n\t\nUnder Image Adjust, adjust the brightness, contrast, or opacity and select the color scale.\nUse the ROI Tools to specify a region of interest (ROI) in an optical image and measure the signal intensity within the ROI. If needed, export the quantified signal data to a spreadsheet software and plot the data.\nFor follow-up studies, analyze mice necropsies of various tissues (e.g., liver, lung, heart, kidney, spleen, brain etc.) side-by-side for a detailed non-specific distribution of fluorescently labeled antibody.\n\t\tNOTE: Data can be further supported with tissue specific ELISA by making use of antigen (FOLR1 in this case) in 96 well assays.\nSubscription Required.
