    "A major requirement for this protocol is to experimentally establish the optimum concentration of CFW or CR to be used. This may be influenced by several parameters, including size of the inoculum, genetic background of the strains and composition of the growth medium. The wild type strain used in our laboratory was Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici (strain 4287/FGSC 9935). Appropriate CFW and CR concentration should be sublethal for the wild-type or reference strain used in the experiment. We typically define this parameter by inoculating serial dilutions of conidia in the form of spots on plates containing CFW and CR, with concentrations in the range of 10-200 μg/ml of CFW and 5-600 μg/ml of CR.Production of fresh microconidia (3-4 d)Inoculate 50 µl of a -80 °C stock microconidial suspension (in 30% glycerol) into 50 ml of liquid potato dextrose broth (PDB) (see Recipe 1). Grow cultures for 3-4 d at 28  °C with shaking at 170 rpm (Di Pietro and Roncero, 1998). Filter microconidia through one layer of Miracloth, centrifuge and wash with sterile water. Count conidia using a neubauer chamber and adjust to a final concentration of 1 x 107 conidia/ml.Preparation of stock solutions of CFW (20 mg/ml) and CR (50 mg/ml) (1 h) (see Recipe 2)Preparation of growth medium (1-2 h)Prepare growth agar medium and autoclave (20 min at 120 °C). Cool the medium down to 50-60 °C in a water bath before adding CR and CFW to avoid any potentially harming fumes. Then, add CFW or CR to reach the desired concentrations. This can be done in a laminar flow hood. For F. oxysporum, we suggest to start by testing 4-5 different dye concentrations, in the following range: 10 to 200 μg/ml for CFW and 10 to 600 µg/ml for CR.",
    "Additionally, prepare a control plate without the dyes. The plates can be stored overnight, at room temperature and in the dark, to be used the next day.Preparation of a serial dilution of microconidia (1-2 h)Prepare a 10-fold serial dilution of freshly-obtained microconidia starting with the 1 x 107 conidia/ml stock solution generated in step 1 (1 x 107, 1 x 106, 1 x 105 and 1 x 104 conidial/ml). Inoculate 2 µl drops of this series on plates containing CFW or CR and a control plate (final concentrations: 2 x 104, 2 x 103, 2 x 102 and 2 x 10 conidia/ml). We typically use square (120 x 120 mm) Petri dishes, to allow sufficient space for growth of the fungal colonies.Incubation of plates (2-3 d)Incubate plates at 28 °C in the dark for 2-3 d.Interpreting and monitoring resultsSensitivity to CFW and CR should be determined by comparing the extent of colony formation of parental and mutant strains in control and CFW or CR plates. Colony diameter may be measured for quantification of differences in colony growth of the strains tested. For this, inoculate each single strain (a 5 µl drop of a 1 x 107 microconia/ml suspension) on the control and cell wall stress plates, with 5 replicates each. We use round (90 mm diameter) Petri dishes. Incubate the plates at 28 °C for 5 d before scanning and measuring colony diameter.Data from three independent experiments, each with five replicates, can then be analyzed with a statistic software such as SPSS 15.0 for Windows®. Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Mann-Whitney test are used to assess statistically relevant differences among strains at P ≤ 0.05."
