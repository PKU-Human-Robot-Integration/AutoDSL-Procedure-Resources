    "Intravenous catheterizationIn this self-administration protocol, rats learn to press a lever to receive–through a permanent catheter inserted into the jugular vein–a direct intravenous infusion of a fixed volume of cocaine dissolved in saline. This direct delivery of drug into the vein allows it to rapidly reach the brain and link the operant response to the rewarding effects felt upon drug delivery. For a schematic of the catheters we use, refer to Figure 1B.Perform surgery to implant an intravenous catheter into the right jugular vein of each rat. For a list of parts for this surgery refer to the Equipment section, and for a detailed video of the steps of surgery please refer to Feng et al., 2015.We use short pieces of Tygon tubing that have been sealed off at one end (referred to as I.V . blockers; see Figure 1B: Item 4) to cap the entry port of the catheters. Zinc-coated hex bolts (referred to as bolts; see Figure 1B: Item 5) are also used to protect the threads and the entry port of the catheters. We have found that this combination works better for our catheters than other commercially available catheter blockers. The bolt and I.V. blocker are removed prior to behavioral training, sterilized in 70% ethanol during behavioral sessions, and reattached prior to returning rats to their home cages. Post-surgery care Post-operative care includes daily monitoring of rats, and post-surgical observations are documented on each rat’s cage card for at least three days.Measure and record body weight for each rat. Monitor weight loss and report to your institutional veterinarian if a rat loses > 10% of its body weight in a day. Typically, rats lose ~10 g the day after surgery and will regain this weight during their recovery period.",
    "Give rats subcutaneous injections of the veterinary nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ketoprofen (2.5 mg/kg) once rats have shown complete recovery from anesthesia (approximately 1-2 h after surgery) and also the next day to provide analgesia and decrease inflammation. Discontinue this step after the first day unless rats show signs of distress on the following days.Fill a 1 ml Luer-lock syringe with gentamicin solution (4.25 mg/ml in sterile saline). Connect it to the catheter port using a piece of connecting Tygon tubing attached to a modified needle on the end of the syringe. Slowly inject 0.1 ml gentamicin solution into vein through the catheter. This step helps to minimize microbial infection following surgery and maintain catheter patency.Behavior room setupThe behavior room, sound attenuating chambers, and behavioral testing boxes should all be sanitized prior to starting any behavioral run. Additionally, test all equipment (pumps, lights, levers) and behavioral monitoring programs, assign rats to individual behavior boxes, and set up individual drug syringes for each rat on the day before the first session. In our original study, we used a cocaine dose of 0.75 mg/kg/infusion and an infusion volume of 0.1 ml/infusion during all phases of behavioral training. Please refer to Figure 1A for a detailed schematic showing the setup of the behavioral chambers and the components described during this protocol.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191202/20191202012209_6923.jpgFigure 1.

Refer to Cocaine dose calculations in Notes for an example of cocaine dose calculation. Label each syringe with the rat number, the number of the behavior chamber in which they are trained, and the dose of cocaine they need based on their weight. Each rat’s drug dose should also be checked against their weight periodically to account for changes of dose based on weight increases during the course of training. Counterbalancing cues: As discussed earlier, we used two different light cues as the discriminative stimuli in our task. We used different color caps (red vs. white) and different spatial locations (left vs. right side of the central lever) to help rats discriminate between these two stimuli during training. Although we did not observe any differences in training based on which light cue was used as the DS+ or DS-, it is advisable to counterbalance the two colors across your behavior boxes. For example, if the two light colors are white and red, set up your boxes so that the DS+ light is red in half of the boxes and white in the other half. Lever tightness: When using Med Associates levers, downward deflection of the lever (i.e., a lever press) leads to the temporary closure of a switch that is in turn read as an operant response by the computer. The tension on these levers can be adjusted (by tightening a spring) to precisely control how much force is necessary to trigger the switch. As rats of different weights (e.g., male vs.",
    "female rats of similar ages) might have varying amounts of strength, we tune the lever ‘tightness’ based on the size of the rats but keep it consistent between boxes of rats with similar weights. To optimize lever tightness, we recommend that you observe the rats on the first few days of training and confirm that they are able to depress the lever (such that it reads as a response on the computer) when they lean onto it with both front paws. If a rat is unable to depress the lever (because it is too tight) and receive reinforcement, it will not learn that responses on the lever lead to reward, making it unlikely that it will learn the task.Cocaine self-administration training stage 1: Continuous access (2 x 3 h sessions per day, 3 consecutive days, see Figure 2A) The goal of this stage is to train rats to press the central retractable lever to receive an infusion of cocaine. In this stage, the lever is permanently available throughout the session, and the light on the left of the lever is always on. This is the light that will eventually turn on during DS+ trials in the trial-based task. Responses on the lever result in a single 3.5 s infusion of cocaine (0.75 mg/kg/inf) through the back-mounted intravenous catheter. Additional responses during this 3.5 s period are not reinforced. By the end of this stage, rats should stably administer 25-30 infusions of cocaine in each 3 h session.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191202/20191202012411_2614.jpgFigure 2.

    "Timing of events during a single trial block and distinction between the two trial types.Bring rats out of the vivarium and to the room in which behavioral procedures will be conducted. Measure and record body weight for each rat at the start of the day. Always check to ensure that rats have not lost weight (> 10% decrease in body weight) compared to the previous day. Typically, rats will gain ~2-5 g each day during cocaine self-administration training. Disconnect the bolt and I.V. blocker from the catheter port. Place them in 70% ethanol. Administer 0.1 ml gentamicin intravenously (as described in Procedure B) to each rat and connect its back-mounted catheter to the drug line and swivel-tethered protective spring sleeve in its assigned operant box. Immediately prior to attaching a rat to its drug line, manually activate the pump motor to run the line through with drug and confirm that it is dripping consistently out of the end of the line. This allows you to test the infusion pumps and to ensure that there are no interruptions and/or air bubbles in the fluid line. Close the doors of both the behavioral chamber and the sound-attenuating chamber. Once all rats are in their respective boxes, set up the MedPC program and start the behavioral session. The sequence of steps described above in Steps D1-D5 is hereafter referred to in the protocol as ‘loading rats’.Perform checks on behavior of rats to ensure that they are not becoming tangled in their tethers and/or detached from their drug lines. Also, observe that the timing of infusions is regular and uniformly spaced during the session. Rats typically take 8-12 infusions per hour at the 0.75 mg/kg/inf. dose recommended for this procedure. It is recommended that you check on the rats once every 30-45 min.",
    "Perform checks more frequently if rats are rapidly increasing their levels of cocaine self-administration, as it may become more likely that they will become tangled/detached as a result of increased activity.At this stage of training, not all rats will readily pick up self-administration (i.e., press the lever to complete the operant requirement to receive cocaine reward). Priming may be necessary to facilitate learning for any rats that have not performed a lever press within the first 45 min of the first training session. Follow the Cocaine priming procedure in Notes. If any rats show signs of loss of catheter patency, conduct appropriate tests to confirm patency (see Notes 6-7).Wait 30 min after the end of the first session of each day before starting the second session. Do not remove rats from boxes between the first and second session of the day.At the end of the afternoon session, disconnect each rat from its spring and infusion line, flush with 0.1 ml gentamicin and reattach the bolt and I.V. blocker to its catheter. Place each rat back in its homecage and return to the vivarium. This sequence of steps is hereafter referred to in the protocol as ‘unloading rats’.Log the body weight of each rat, the number of lever responses made per session, and the number of infusions received during each 3-h session. Plot these measures as the mean of all rats in the group each day.Repeat Steps D1-D11 for 3 days. If rats do not achieve stable levels of drug intake, this stage of training can be extended for an additional 2 days (4 more sessions).Give rats a day off from behavior training prior to starting the next stage of training. We typically train rats that have not reached stable responding on two additional remedial sessions during this day off.",
    "Cocaine self-administration training stage 2: Introduction to trial format (2 x 3 h sessions per day, 30 DS+ only trials in the morning, 30 DS- only trials in the afternoon, 2 consecutive days, see Figures 2A and 2C) The goal of this stage is to train rats to continue pressing the central retractable lever when the task format is switched from continuous access to a trial-based design. In this stage, rats get 30 DS+ trials in the morning session and 30 DS- trials in the afternoon session. Each trial begins by the illumination of the respective cue light for 30 s, followed by the extension of the lever. After 60 s of lever access, the trial ends as the cue light turns off and the lever is retracted. The end of each trial is followed by a variable inter-trial interval (ITI-270 s average), after which a new trial begins. During DS+ trials, the light on the left side of the lever is illuminated and responses on the lever result in a single 3.5 s infusion of cocaine (0.75 mk/kg/inf). Additional responses during this 3.5 s period are not reinforced. During DS- trials, the light on the right side of the lever is illuminated and responses on the lever do not result in cocaine infusions. Thus, during this phase, rats learn the trial-based format and also experience both trial types, but in isolation. By the end of this phase, rats should still stably administer 25-30 infusions of cocaine in the DS+ only session but should reduce responding during the DS- only session. Load rats and run them on the appropriate MedPC program by following Steps D1-D5. Perform checks on behavior of rats as described earlier (Step D7).",
    "A sudden change in rates of responding can be an indicator that a rat is not receiving its expected level of drug reward per infusion–this could happen because of pump failure, catheter failure, lever malfunction, depletion of the syringe, or disconnection of the rat’s drug infusion line during the session. If this occurs, first disconnect the rat from its line and then perform necessary checks to determine the source of the problem. Only reconnect the rat once you have corrected the situation. For more details on loss of patency, refer to Checking for Catheter Patency in Notes.At this stage of training, prime any rat who appears to be responding significantly less in the morning sessions because of the switch to the trial format and/or those who are still not responding consistently. Do not prime the rats during DS- only sessions. Follow the Cocaine priming procedure in Notes. If any rat shows signs of loss of catheter patency, conduct appropriate tests to confirm patency (see Notes 6-7).Wait 30 min after the end of the first session of each day before starting the second session. Do not remove rats from boxes between the first and second session of the day.At the end of the afternoon session, disconnect each rat from its spring and infusion line, flush with 0.1 ml gentamicin and reattach the bolt and I.V. blocker to its catheter. Place each animal back in its homecage and return to the vivarium.Record the body weight of each rat, as well as the number of trials of each type in which an animal makes at least one response (“trials”). Also, record the number of lever responses made during each trial type per session (“lever presses”) and the number of infusions received across all DS+ trials in a 3 h session (“infusions”).",
    "Plot these measures as the mean of all rats in the group each day.Repeat Steps E1-E7 for 2 days. If rats do not achieve stable levels of drug intake, this stage of training can be extended for an additional 2 days (4 more sessions).Give rats a day off from behavior training prior to starting the next stage of training. We typically train rats that haven’t reached stable responding on two additional remedial sessions during this day off.Cocaine self-administration training stage 3: Discrimination (2 x 3 h sessions per day with pseudorandomized presentation of 30 DS+ and 30 DS- trials in every session, 5-10 days, see Figures 2A and 2C)The goal of this stage is to train rats to discriminate between DS+ and DS- trials and only respond on the central retractable lever during DS+ trials. In this stage, rats get 30 DS+ and 30 DS- trials in each 3 h session. Trial timing and reward rules for each trial type are the same as in the previous phase, but the inter-trial intervals are reduced to a 90 s average to accommodate for the additional trials in each 3 h session, and DS+ and DS- trials are presented in a pseudorandomized manner so that rats are required to pay attention to the DS in order to determine whether cocaine is available. Thus, during this stage, rats learn to respond discriminatively (i.e., to respond only during DS+ trials) and stably administer 25-30 infusions of cocaine in each 3 h session. We average each rat’s discrimination ratio (DR, total number of lever presses during all DS+ trials/total number of lever presses during all DS- trials) over the last 3 sessions and consider a rat to be trained when its DR ≥ 3.",
    "Load rats and run them on the appropriate MedPC program by following Steps D1-D5.At this stage of training, prime rats who demonstrate low overall levels of responding (i.e., those who do not appear to be responding consistently enough to achieve at least 10 infusions per session-see Expected behavioral response timing in Notes for more details on “consistent” responding). Do not prime during DS- trials. Cease all priming efforts starting at the third-to-last training session before the Day 1 relapse test. Follow the Cocaine priming procedure in Notes. If any rats show signs of loss of catheter patency, conduct appropriate tests to confirm patency (see Notes 6-7).Perform checks on behavior of rats as described earlier (Step D7).Continue to ensure that any apparent sudden behavioral changes are not the result of failures of any of the mechanisms involved in drug delivery (for more details on this, see Step E3).Wait 30 min after the end of the first session of each day before starting the second session. Do not remove rats from boxes between the first and second session of the day. See Step D10 for details on unloading rats after the second session of the day and Step E7 for details on recording data.Repeat Steps F1-F6 until rats show stable discriminated responding for cocaine. Typically, rats achieve stable discrimination over 10-16 sessions (5-8 days). Give rats a day off from behavior after 3-5 consecutive training days and ensure that they have at least 3 consecutive days of training prior to their first relapse test (day 1 relapse test).Abstinence (1- 400 days, see Figure 2B)In this phase, rats are kept in their home cages in the vivarium. They do not receive any additional training, and hence, do not have access to cocaine.",
    "Check on rats twice a week and ensure that they still have their bolts and I.V. blockers on their catheters.Handle rats to keep them socialized during long durations of abstinence. This can help to minimize handling-related stress during testing.Relapse to cocaine seeking test (1 x 3 h session on each test day with pseudorandomized presentation of 30 DS+ and 30 DS- trials, see Figures 2B and 2C)In this phase, we test rats for DS-controlled drug-seeking (i.e., responding on the lever that they previously associated with cocaine access, but while no drug is available during the session). The session format and trial spacing are the same as during discrimination training.Clean behavior boxes and set up the room in the same way as at the start of behavioral training (see Procedure C) but with the exceptions noted below. Turn off the syringe pumps and disconnect all syringes from their infusion lines.Ensure that all lines formerly used for drug delivery are cleared of any traces of drug by flushing first with D.I. water, then 100% ethanol, and finally with air through the line to clear traces of ethanol. Load rats into individual operant boxes after weighing and mock intravenous gentamicin administration (follow the steps described in Post-Surgery Care, but do not infuse any gentamicin through the catheter). Perform only mock intravenous gentamicin administration during loading on relapse test days, as loss of catheter patency over time may cause flushing to become painful and thereby stress rats before the test. Set up the MedPC program and start the behavioral session. At the end of the session, disconnect each rat from its spring and infusion line, perform mock flush with 0.1 ml gentamicin and reattach the bolt and I.V. blocker to its catheter. Place each rat back in its homecage and return to the vivarium.",
    "Record the body weight of each rat, as well as the number of trials of each type in which an animal makes at least one response (“trials”). Also record the number of lever responses made during each trial type per session (“lever presses”). Plot these measures as the mean of all rats in the group each day."
