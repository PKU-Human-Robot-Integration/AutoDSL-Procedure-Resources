    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis method first prepares a single-cell suspension of total brain cells, using the Miltenyi Biotec Adult Brain Dissociation Kit (kits purchased from 2019 onwards). The cell suspension is then further processed to purify adult microglia and astrocytes.\nIsolation of total adult brain cells\nTiming: 4 h\nThis protocol enables the successful dissociation of murine brains into single-cell suspensions. The protocol below can be used for adult (4 weeks or older) and aged mice.\nIsolate the brain from an adult or aged mouse.\nSacrifice the mouse using CO2. Spray the mouse with ethanol, and then decapitate it using sterile scissors.\nNote: Transcardial perfusion is not required for these protocols. Any circulating immune cells will not survive the culturing conditions and so will not affect the purity of the obtained cells (Swamydas et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]; Grosjean et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Ramezani-Rad and Rickert, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nUsing fresh sterile scissors and forceps, remove the skull from the head (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1551-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Adult glial isolation protocol\n(A) Adult murine brain is removed from the skull.\n(B) Miltenyi Biotec OctoDissociator with heaters.\n(C) Adult murine brain after homogenization with OctoDissociator.\n(D) Adult murine brain debris removal step, before and after centrifugation.\n(E) Examples of confluent and non-confluent mixed glial cultures after 12 days in culture. Scale bars, 50 μm.\nOnce the brain is isolated, perform all future protocol steps within a biosafety cabinet.\nObtain a bulk single-cell suspension from the brain, as per the following detailed manufacturer’s instructions for the Miltenyi Biotec Adult Brain Dissociation Kit (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B–1D):\nCritical: All steps of the Miltenyi Biotec Adult Brain Dissociation protocol must be completed using ice-cold buffers and samples kept on ice.\nPlace the brain in a 50 mL Falcon tube containing 1 mL ice-cold PBS-g.",
    "Prepare the enzyme mix by adding 50 μL Enzyme P, 1,900 μL Buffer Z, 20 μL Buffer Y and 10 μL Enzyme A to a C-tube.\nAdd ×1 adult mouse brain to the C-tube and roughly chop with a scalpel.\nPlace the C-tube on the gentleMACS Octo Dissociator machine with heaters and select program 37°C_ABDK_01 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nOnce the program is complete (after 30 min), remove the C-tube and centrifuge it at 500 × g for 5 s to collect all homogenized brain contents at the bottom of the tube (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nResuspend the brain homogenate and filter through a 70 μm cell strainer into a 50 mL Falcon tube.\nWash the C-tube with 10 mL ice-cold PBS-g and pass it through the cell strainer into the Falcon tube to collect any residual brain homogenate (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nCentrifuge the filtered brain homogenate at 300 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nAfter centrifugation, gently remove the supernatant from the brain homogenate pellet and resuspend in 1 mL ice-cold PBS-g (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nTransfer the brain homogenate to a 15 mL Falcon tube.\nTop up the brain homogenate to a final volume of 3,100 μL with PBS-g.",
    "Critical: To ensure efficient debris removal and maximal sample purity using the Miltenyi Biotec Adult Brain Dissociation Kit protocol, resuspend the brain tissue pellet with PBS-g to generate a total volume of 3,100 μL before adding the Debris Removal Solution. To achieve this exact volume, it is recommended to add 1 mL of PBS-g to the brain tissue pellet, resuspend the pellet thoroughly and transfer it to the 15 mL Falcon tube being used in the next step. While transferring the resuspended pellet, take note of the actual volume being transferred (usually around 1,800 μL). From there, add the appropriate amount of additional PBS to the Falcon tube to achieve a total volume of 3,100 μL.\nAdd 900 μL Debris Removal Solution to the brain homogenate and mix well but gently.\nGently overlay the brain homogenate with 4 mL PBS-g (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nOnce overlaid, centrifuge the overlaid brain homogenate at 3,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C with no brake.\nCritical: During the debris removal step, cells must be centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C with NO BRAKE, to maximize clear cell separation (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D). Leaving the brake on disrupts the layers and makes debris removal more difficult.\nAfter centrifugation, remove the top two layers containing the debris layer and buffer (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nFill the 15 mL Falcon tube with PBS-g and centrifuge at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C with brake.\nRemove the supernatant from the Falcon tube and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL 1× Red Blood Cell Removal solution.\nIncubate at 4°C for 10 min.\nAfter incubation, add 10 mL PBS containing 1% FCS to stop the red blood cell lysis, and centrifuge the Falcon tube at 300 × g for 10 min at 4°C.",
    "The cell pellet now contains the total single-cell suspension from the adult brain.\nEither directly isolate microglia using a CD11b magnetic sort (Protocol I), or culture total brain cells in flasks as an adult mixed glial culture from which microglia and astrocytes are purified at day 12 (Protocol II).\nProtocol I: Isolation of adult microglia using magnetic sorting\nTiming: 5 days\nThis protocol enables the successful culture and isolation of pure adult microglia for in vitro characterization using a magnetic sort system to positively select microglia that are CD11bpos (https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/AU-en/products/cd11b-microbeads-human-and-mouse.html#gref[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/AU-en/products/cd11b-microbeads-human-and-mouse.html#gref]).\nResuspend the bulk brain cell suspension obtained in step 2 above, using 90 μL MACS buffer per 1 × 107 cells (an adult brain will usually yield ∼3 × 106 cells in total).\nAdd 10 μL of anti-CD11b magnetic beads per 1 × 107 cells (if cell yield is less than 1 × 107, use 10 μL anti-CD11b magnetic beads as a minimum).\nIncubate at 4°C for 15 min to sufficiently ‘label’ the microglia.\nAdd 2 mL MACS buffer to the tube to wash the cells.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min at 4°C and aspirate the cell supernatant.\nMeanwhile, prepare a MACS MS column as follows (each MS column can process ≤1 × 107 cells).\nPlace the MS column onto an OctoMACS magnetic separator.\nAdd a 70 μm cell strainer to the top of the column and apply 500 μL MACS buffer to the strainer, so that the buffer flows through the column.\nResuspend the cells from step 8 in 500 μL MACS buffer and apply the suspension to the MS column through the 70 μm cell strainer.\nWash the cell strainer and column 3 times with 500 μL MACS buffer.",
    "Add 1 mL MACS buffer to the MS column and remove it from the magnetic strip, then expel the MACS buffer through the column using the supplied plunger into a fresh 15 mL Falcon tube (this constitutes the ‘CD11bpos cells’ fraction, containing microglia).\nPellet the CD11bpos cells by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min at 4°C, and then aspirate the cell supernatant.\nResuspend the CD11bpos cell pellet in 300 μL AGM.\nPerform flow cytometry to determine the microglial purity at day 0 (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1551-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Data were analyzed using an unpaired student t-test (∗ p<0.05, ∗∗ p<0.01, ∗∗∗ p<0.001, ∗∗∗∗ p<0.0001).\nCount live cells using a hemocytometer with Trypan Blue exclusion.\nSeed microglia at 3 × 105 cells per cm2 well size in AGM containing 50 ng/mL GM-CSF and 100 ng/mL M-CSF, and culture the cells in a 37°C/5% CO2 incubator for 5 days.\nChange the culture media the day after seeding, and every subsequent second day.\nAssay microglia for phenotypes of interest on day 5 after seeding.\nProtocol II: Isolation of adult microglia and astrocytes using mechanical and magnetic sorting\nTiming: 11–14 days",
    "This protocol allows for the successful culture and isolation of pure adult microglia and astrocytes for in vitro characterization. It uses mechanical separation to obtain microglia, and a CD11b magnetic sort system to negatively sort astrocytes, which do not express CD11b (https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/AU-en/products/cd11b-microbeads-human-and-mouse.html#gref[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/AU-en/products/cd11b-microbeads-human-and-mouse.html#gref]).\nResuspend the bulk brain cell suspension obtained in step 2 above in 7.5 mL AGM containing 50 ng/mL GM-CSF and 100 ng/mL M-CSF. Add to a T25 cell culture grade flask (day 0).\nCulture adult mixed glial cells in a 37°C/5% CO2 incubator for 11–14 days, as follows:\nOn day 5 of culture, remove half the media and discard. Replace with fresh AGM containing 50 ng/mL GM-CSF and 100 ng/mL of M-CSF.\nOn day 10 in culture, remove all media from the flask and replace with fresh AGM containing 50 ng/mL GM-CSF and 100 ng/mL of M-CSF.\nIsolate pure adult microglia from mixed glial culture, as follows:\nOn days 11–14, top up media to a total of 10 mL and shake the flask at 180 rpm at 37°C without CO2 for 2.5 h.\nNote: Cells are usually confluent by day 11 and suitable to harvest. However, if there is a lower cell yield, or the cells are less confluent, culturing can be extended slightly (until day 14) before harvesting.\nAfter cell shaking, transfer the culture media (containing microglia) from the flask to a 50 mL Falcon tube.\nCollect any remaining cells adhering to the flask with 5 mL ice-cold PBS and add this wash to the Falcon tube containing the microglia from the previous step.\nCentrifuge the Falcon tube containing the shaken media and wash solutions at 300 × g for 10 min at RT to pellet the microglial cells.\nAspirate the cell supernatant and resuspend the microglial cell pellet in 300 μL AGM.",
    "Count live cells using a hemocytometer with Trypan Blue exclusion.\nPerform flow cytometry to determine microglial purity (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] + see section “Characterisation and analysis of adult and aged glial cells by flow cytometry[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4]”).\nSeed microglia at 3 × 105 cells per cm2 well size in AGM containing 50 ng/mL GM-CSF and 100 ng/mL M-CSF.\nCulture the cells in a 37°C/5% CO2 incubator for 2 days and assay microglia for phenotypes of interest on day 2 after seeding.\nNote: Protocol II can achieve high microglial purity on the day of isolation, and unwanted cells do not appear in the culture over time. It is thus recommended to leave the microglia for 2 days in culture after the isolation protocol such that they can attach to the well and fully elongate.\nIsolate adult astrocytes from the mixed glial culture, as follows:\nTo obtain the astrocyte-enriched population still adhering to the flask after step 20c, add 2.5 mL of pre-warmed 37°C trypsin-EDTA to the flask and incubate in a 37°C/5% CO2 incubator for 5 min.\nDisrupt the astrocyte layer by firmly tapping the flask underside and return to the incubator for a further 5 min.\nOnce again disrupt the astrocyte layer by firmly tapping the flask underside. Add 5 mL of AGM to the flask to inactivate the trypsin.\nUsing a cell scraper, gently scrape any cells that remain adherent to the flask.\nTransfer the cell culture media from the flask to a new 50 mL Falcon tube.\nPellet the cells by centrifuging at 300 × g for 10 min at RT and aspirate the cell supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 2 mL PBS and apply to a new 50 mL Falcon tube via a 70 μm cell strainer to remove debris and obtain a single cell suspension.",
    "Wash the cell strainer with 10 mL PBS into the Falcon tube to collect any remaining cells.\nCentrifuge this tube at 300 × g for 10 min to pellet the cells and aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in 90 μL MACS buffer per flask (×1 flask should yield ∼1–2 × 106 cells).\nCount live cells using a hemocytometer with Trypan Blue exclusion.\nPurification of adult astrocytes using magnetic separation:\nAdd 10 μL of anti-CD11b magnetic beads per 1 × 107 cells (if the yield is less than 1 × 107 cells, use a minimum of 10 μL anti-CD11b magnetic beads).\nIncubate at 4°C for 15 min.\nAdd 2 mL MACS buffer to wash the cells.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min at 4°C and aspirate the cell supernatant.\nMeanwhile, prepare a MACS MS column (each MS column can process ≤1 × 107 cells).\nPlace the MS column onto the OctoMACS separator.\nPlace a 70 μm cell strainer on top of the column and apply 1 mL MACS buffer to the strainer so it equilibrates the column.\nPlace a 15 mL Falcon tube underneath the MS column to collect the CD11b-negative flow-through fraction (‘purified astrocytes’ tube).\nResuspend the cell pellet from step 22d in 500 μL MACS buffer, and apply these cells to the MS column via the 70 μm cell strainer.\nWash the cell strainer and column 3 times with 500 μL MACS buffer, and collect all flow-through fractions into the ‘purified astrocytes’ tube.\nPellet the astrocytes by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min at 4°C and aspirate the cell supernatant.\nResuspend the astrocyte pellet in 300 μL AGM.\nCount live cells using a hemocytometer with Trypan Blue exclusion.\nPerform flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry to determine cell purity (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1551-Fig4.jpg",

    "This protocol describes a reliable way to assess microglial and astrocytic cell preparation purity using flow cytometry. CD45 and CD11b are ideal surface markers to both evaluate the microglial culture purity (CD45posCD11bpos) and measure the astrocytic culture purity (CD45negCD11bneg). This protocol also demonstrates how to assess cell aging markers in microglia isolated from young and aged mice by flow cytometry. Well-studied markers of aging were used to establish a baseline of our age-related phenotype (on day 0, immediately after isolation from brain), and then to assess any changes in these markers after the culturing period (day 12) (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). These markers include microglial granularity (as measured by side scatter in flow cytometry) (Ritzel et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]), CD68 expression (O'Neil et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Farso et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]), and MHCII expression (Streit et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1551-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

    "This protocol describes how to prepare adult and aged microglia and astrocytes for analysis by immunocytochemistry with cell-specific markers (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). For this purpose, adult mice are defined as 6–12 weeks old and aged mice as 18–24 months old.\nCoat 12 mm 1.0′ coverslips with 500 μL Poly-L-lysine solution (1:10 dilution in water) by incubating for 1 h at RT in a 24-well plate. Wash coverslips three times with sterile PBS and leave overnight at 4°C to dry.\nPlate cells on coverslips and culture cells for 2–5 days, as follows:\nFollowing shaking in step 20 above, plate adult microglia (100,000 cells/500 μL) on Poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips and culture in a 37°C/5% CO2 incubator for an additional 2 days.\nFollowing CD11b magnetic depletion in step 22 above, plate astrocytes (50,000 cells/500 μL) and culture in a 37°C/5% CO2 incubator for an additional 5 days.\nAspirate the cell culture media and wash cells twice with PBS.\nFix cells with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min at RT. Wash coverslips thrice with PBS.\nBlock unspecific binding site with 0.5% BSA/PBS for 30 min at RT.\nStain cells with cell-specific markers (see Materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] for antibody details) in 0.5% BSA/PBS for 1 h at RT. For example, use anti-Iba1 antibody (1:500 dilution, 1 μg/mL final concentration) and/or anti-GFAP antibody (1:500 dilution, 1 μg/mL final concentration).\nWash the coverslips 5 times (5 min each) with PBS.\nStain cells (see Materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] for antibody details) in 0.5% BSA/PBS for 1 h at RT. For example, use DAPI (1:1,000 dilution, 20 ng/mL final concentration), phalloidin 647 (1:40 dilution), Alexa Fluor 488 anti-goat (1:500 dilution, 4 μg/mL final concentration) and Alexa Fluor 594 anti-rabbit (1:500 dilution, 4 μg/mL final concentration) in 0.5% BSA (1 h, RT).",
    "Wash the coverslips 5 times (5 min each) with PBS.\nMount the coverslips on microscope slides with Prolong gold antifade reagent. Coat the edges of the coverslip with a thin layer of clear nail polish and leave to dry (1 h, RT). Store at 4°C for long term storage.\nNote: Samples were visualized on a Zeiss LSM710 AiryScan NLO with ZEN software. Image analysis was completed using the program FIJI. Background signal was subtracted from images using the Math function on the FIJI software.\nEvaluation of protocol I versus protocol II\nPrevious publications in the field have utilized Percoll gradients and magnetic separation of brain homogenates to isolate and culture microglia for in vitro characterization (Protocol I) (Mela et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Guillot-Sestier et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Grabert and McColl, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Njie et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Bohlen et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). However, such methods of isolation and purification result in low cell yield and low cell viability, making it difficult to perform multiple assays with the same cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). In comparison, our newly developed method (Protocol II) allows for the successful culture of both young and aged murine microglia and astrocytes, while optimising cell preparation workflows to obtain a high yield of pure microglia and astrocytes from adult and aged brains (Figures 2–4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]; ; ).\nWe have described a robust protocol to obtain pure microglia from adult and aged brains, using a method that also enables astrocyte purification using CD11b magnetic depletion. After shaking the microglia from the flask, some CD11b+ microglia remain attached to the flask, and can contaminate the astrocyte population remaining adherent to the flask. To generate pure astrocyte cultures, it is thus critical to deplete CD11b-positive cells from the astrocyte fraction by magnetic separation (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).",
    "While Protocol II employs a longer culturing protocol than Protocol I, it also maintains the age-related phenotypes of the microglia that are observed on day 0 (the day of harvest) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). Protocol II is thus the protocol of choice for ex vivo investigations of microglia aged in vivo. Protocol II evaluates the % microglia in total brain homogenate at day 0 (the day of harvest), while purity of microglia is only assessed at day 11 after culturing the mixed glia culture.\nNote: Upon using either Protocol I or II, the cultured microglia present an activated status and start to upregulate surfaces markers such as MHCII, as expected in the presence of GM-CSF. Importantly however, the Protocol II microglia maintain the age-related phenotype present at day 0."
