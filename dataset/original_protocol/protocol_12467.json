    "All procedures were in accordance with Brown University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines.\n1. Systems Overview\nA video tracking system interacts with a behavioral control system to monitor the rat's progress in a given task, evaluate target behaviors, control stimulus presentation and deliver rewards based on the rat's progress. An vivo electrophysiological recording system collects neural data for event related analyses. (Figure 1A).\nThe Floor Projection Maze\n\t\nThe Floor Projection Maze2 is an open field without walls (147.3 cm x 111.8 cm) with a clear colorless Plexiglas floor (0.6 cm thick). The underside of the floor is a unity gain Dual Vision Fabric screen that is stretched over a second rectangle of Plexiglas pieces (147.3 cm x 111.8 cm x 1.25 cm) for rear projection using a short throw projector.\nConnect the projector to the video card in the behavioral system PC. Hold the Plexiglas, screen fabric, and projector using an anodized aluminum frame.\nInstall an overhead anodized frame to mount an overhead camera and a pulley system to interface the ICS and headstage tethers to the rat.\nNote: Connect the frame holding the Floor Projection Maze and overhead frame to ensure electrical continuity and ground to the preamplifier.\nVideo tracking\n\t\nRecord, track and analyze videos in real time with a single overhead camera described in step 1.2.2.\nMount an overhead camera (standard VGA, 80 fps) onto an overhead anodized aluminum frame to monitor the rat\nUse either light emitting diodes (LEDs) attached to the rat's headstage to monitor the position of the rat, or track the centroid of the contour of the rat with an automated tracking system.\nUse the CinePlex Basic Behavior module to analyze the position data online and also save the data file for further offline analysis.",
    "Note: We use the CinePlex Behavioral Research System 3.4.1 for recording, tracking and analyzing the rat's position. The CinePlex Tracking module is used for tracking the rat. For effective tracking of the animal's progress, use the CinePlex Basic Behavior module to create zones in two-dimensional space at relevant positions of the maze that have significance in the task. Zones can be combined into sequences, and CinePlex logical events (such as entries into zones and fulfillment of the sequences) are assigned such that if the rat satisfies the criteria for the event, that event becomes true. Assign events with digital outputs and interface via a superport input card to the behavioral system.\nA fully automated behavioral control system\n\t\nBehavioral test arena: Use an appropriate shaped test arena for the behavioral task on the Floor Projection Maze. Construct the arena using matte white acrylic and place it directly on the Floor Projection Maze.\nNote: Dimensions can be customized for the behavioral task used. Walls are typically 45-50 cm in height. Here we use double-sided test arenas (bowtie maze12) to maximize the number of trials performed in a session (Figure 1B for dimensions of the bowtie maze). The test arena has four designated areas defined in the tracking software: East Image area, West Image Area, an East Trial Ready Area, and a West Trial Ready Area (Figure 1C).\nBehavioral system: A behavioral interface system controlled by MED-PC IV software runs programs written in-house in MEDstate Notation (see Appendix). Use the events from CinePlex behavioral system to track a rat's progress during the task, control image presentation, deliver audio cues and deliver reward.",
    "Interface the superport output card to Omniplex digital input to acquire time stamped behavioral event occurrences in the PlexControl software environment for offline analyses. Issue auditory cues using a programmable audio generator.\nNote: Behavioral events from the apparatus presented here can operate third party equipment (e.g. laser for optogenetic stimulation) via a data transfer board if required.\nHouse the superport output card, superport input card and programmable audio generator in a tabletop interface cabinet. Interface the cards with a DIG-704PCI-2 PCI card installed in a personal computer (PC) using a DIG-700F Decoder card installed in the tabletop cabinet.\nDeliver bipolar square wave ICS to the rat using a programmable intracranial self stimulation stimulator. Connect the stimulator unit to the PC via a PHM152 COM card. Recommended ICS parameters: Pulse 1 and 2 duration: 500 µsec; Delay between Pulse 1 and 2: 500 µsec; Frequency: 100 Hz.\nNote: ICS delivery is automated during the task but can be manually delivered using a programmable button box interfaced with a SmartCtrl module.\nNeural data acquisition system\n\t\nEnsure the Floor Projection Maze frame and ICS system is grounded to the preamplifier of the Omniplex Neural Data Acquisition System to minimize electrical noise in the neural recordings.\nSimultaneously collect neural data, positional coordinates from CinePlex and behavioral event flags from the behavioral system in the data file for offline analyses.\n2. Animal Preparation\nAnimals\n\t\nObtain naïve 22 day old male Long-Evans rats.\nPair house the rats and allow them to acclimatize to the vivarium for one week.\nHandle rats daily for ~5 min.\nOnce rats reach 250-275 g, begin food schedules maintaining their body weights at 85-90% of their free feeding weight. Target weights are increased by 10 g/month until rats reach 350 g.",
    "Single house the rats and continue the food schedule for at least a week before commencing surgery to implant stimulation and recording electrodes.\nSurgical implantation\n\tCarry out surgical procedures under standard aseptic conditions and according to institutional and regulatory guidelines.\n\t\nAnesthetize rats with isoflurane.\nMake an incision in the scalp to reveal the skull for cleaning and identification of bregma and lambda.\nMake craniotomies at the relevant coordinates.\nAffix skull anchor screws.\nLower the tip of an ICS electrode into the MFB using the following coordinates: antero-posterior, -2.7 mm from bregma; lateral, ±1.8 mm; dorsoventral, -8.5 mm from skull surface. A second ICS electrode can be implanted into the opposite hemisphere as a backup in case of electrode malfunction.\nSecure the ICS electrodes to the skull and anchor screws with bone cement. Do not cement the pedestal (plastic housing on the stimulating electrode) of the electrodes.\nLower the recording electrodes into the site of interest and secure the device with bone cement.\nPosition the ICS pedestal away from the recording device and secure the ICS electrodes and recording devices to the anchor screws with bone cement.\nAllow at least seven days recovery before commencing habituation to the shaping protocol.\n3. Behavioral Shaping: General Shaping Consists of Three Stages: Early, Intermediate, and Late Shaping (Figure 2).\nNote: The aim of Early and Intermediate shaping is to train the rat to maintain a stationary 'ready position' in the Ready Area for each trial, and perform numerous trials in a session. Semi-automate behavioral shaping so training can be adapted to a rat's individual learning rates. Once a rat is maintaining a successful 'ready position', proceed to task specific shaping (Late shaping) with the aim of transferring the rat onto a fully automated protocol for precise and unbiased behavioral control (Figure 2).",
    "Early shaping (Figure 2A)\n\t\nDay 1: Habituate the rat to the behavioral room for 10 min with the equipment switched on then return to the colony.\nDay 2: Repeat step 1, then habituate the animal to the testing arena for 10 min.\nDay 3: Connect the ICS and headstage tethers to the rat, and habituate the rat to the testing arena for 10 min.\nDay 4: Determine the lowest  ICS amplitude to establish a place preference using an informal place preference conditioning protocol. Titrate Pulse 1 and 2 amplitudes. Typical amplitude values are 20-80 µA. \nFrom day 5: Deliver ICS reward to train the rats to associate the Ready Area and east and west image presentations with ICS reward. Continue until the rat is alternating between East and West Image Areas.\nIntermediate shaping (Figure 2B).\nIntroduce white noise (50 dB) to signal the start of a trial. Turn off the white noise when the rat enters the Ready Area.\nAutomate ICS delivery for entry into the Ready Area, and for completing successful 'ready positions'. Adjust the probability of ICS delivery at entry and successful 'ready position' to reinforce behavior.\nNote: Adjust the reward probabilities manually to suit individual rat's performance during shaping. Decrease reward probabilities for entry into the Ready Area and maintaining successful ready positions. Recommended final probability of reward for fulfilling successful 'ready positions is 5-10%. Rats are rewarded for all correct choices.\nStart with short 'ready position' durations (e.g. 200 msec). Gradually increase the 'ready position' durations in 100 msec steps.\nTurn on the white noise if the rat prematurely breaks the 'ready position' so the rat has to restart the trial.\nMove to Late shaping when rat is holding in the 'ready position' for up to 1,200 msec.\nLate shaping (Figure 2C).",
    "Note: Training in Late shaping is specific for the task in which the rat will perform. Automate training in this shaping step for precise and unbiased control of all task parameters but maintain flexibility to manually deliver ICS rewards. Training protocols for two tasks are described.\n\t\nVisual biconditional discrimination (vBCD) task: Use distinct visual stimuli to train the rats on a simple shape and luminance discriminence.\n\t\t\nBegin the trial by turning on the white noise.\nRandomly impose 'ready position' latencies of 700 – 1,200 msec.\nDeliver ICS manually if required to reinforce successful 'ready positions'.\nPresent a pair of images in the image presentation area. Pseudorandomly present the correct image on the left or right side of the Image Area.\nDeliver ICS for a correct response and clear the floor. A correct response is registered when the rat enters the zone in which the correct image is located. On the first day of training only, issue a 75 dB burst of white noise as a deterrent for an incorrect response.\nIssue a correction trial after an incorrect trial. Correction trials have identical parameters (left or right side and 'ready position' latency) as the previous incorrect trial.\nOnce the rats are able to successfully perform the simple discrimination, introduce the different floor patterns to train the biconditional discrimination rule.\nPresent a new pair of images and two distinct floor patterns to serve as the context. The correct image is conditional upon the floor pattern; e.g. the black star is correct when the floor is grey and the white circle is correct when the floor is striped (Figure 3C).\nPseudorandomly assign the floor pattern and the position (left or right) of the correct image for each trial ensuring that trials are counterbalanced.",
    "Implement correction trials after an incorrect trial in which the trial parameters are identical to the preceding trial.\nVisuospatial attention (VSA) task: Present illuminated white circles at defined spatial locations in the arena to train the rats to approach the spatial location of the target circle.\nNote: For this task the arena has grey circles at different spatial locations in the East and West Image Areas. After a successful 'ready position', the target circle will illuminate (turn white), and the rat must approach that target location (Figure 3B).\n\t\t\nRandomly impose 'ready position' latencies of 1,000-1,600 msec on a trial by trial basis.\nDeliver ICS manually if required to reinforce successful 'ready positions'.\nAfter completion of 'ready position', randomly illuminate one of the grey circles.\nDeliver ICS when the rat enters the zone of the illuminated circle.\nTurn off illumination and commence the next trial on the opposite (East or West) side.\nAt the start of Late shaping, illuminate the circle until the rat approaches it or until the trial ends (5 sec after illuminating the circle). Score each trial as either correct or an omission trial.  For omission trials, illuminate the whole floor (white floor presented) and no reward will be available until the next trial.\nWhen the rat's performance reaches 80% correct, decrease the amount of time the circle remains illuminated to 1 sec. The rat has 5 sec to make a choice.\nDo not reward for incorrect trials. Start the next trial.\nIf an omission trial, illuminate the floor and start a new trial.\nAt 80% correct further decrease the time the target circle is illuminated to 500 msec.",
    "Choose target locations randomly before each trial.  The rat will continue to have 5 sec to make a choice before the entire floor illuminates to signal the end of that trial.\nDo not reward for incorrect or omission trials. The rat must initiate a new trial on the opposite side of the arena.\nNote: Additional circles may be added in each Image Area to further increase task difficulty."
