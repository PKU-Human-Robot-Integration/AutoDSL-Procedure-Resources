    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCardiac-directed differentiation of hESCs\nTiming: 14–16 days\nCardiac differentiation of hESCs is conducted with the Wnt signaling modulators, based on previously published protocols (Burridge et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Lian et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) with minor modifications (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). This approach can generate efficiently cTnT+ cardiomyocytes occupying 60%–80% of the total differentiated cells in 10–12 days, via the ISL1+ multipotent cardiac progenitors (MCPs) and cardiac intermediates on day 3 and day 6 of differentiation, respectively. This protocol also generates small subsets of other cardiac derivatives, such as pacemaker, smooth muscle, and endothelial cells (Sahara et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/472-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. hESC cardiac differentiation protocol based on Wnt signaling modulation\nCM, cardiomyocyte; MCP, multipotent cardiac progenitor; ME, medium exchange.\nCritical: For efficient differentiation, it is highly recommended to use hESCs with less than 50–60 passages.\nFour days before differentiation (day −4): Dissociate hESCs cultured on maintenance plates with 80%–90% confluency into single cells, and seed them on differentiation plates:\nAspirate the old mTeSR1 medium on Matrigel-coated 6-well plates and wash the cells with DPBS once.\nAdd 1 mL of Accutase to each well. Put the plate in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator for 5–10 min.\nAdd 1 mL of mTeSR1 or fetal bovine serum (FBS) to each well. Collect all the cells into a 15-mL conical tube by gently pipetting.\nNote: Before use, warm all medium, serum, and solutions at 20°C–25°C for more than 20–30 min.\nCount the total cell number using an automated cell counter or a hemocytometer.\nCentrifuge the pooled cells at 200 × g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in mTeSR1 supplemented with 5 μM Y-27632 (a ROCK inhibitor) at an appropriate cell density (e.g., 0.5–1 million cells per mL).",
    "Seed 250,000–500,000 dissociated cells in a final volume of 1 mL media (mTeSR1 + 5 μM Y-27632) per well of Matrigel-coated 12-well plates.\nCritical: The optimal seeding density on plates for efficient cardiac differentiation is variable and dependent on cell lines and passage numbers. The pilot experiments are required to determine it in each experimental case (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1]).\nDays −3 to −1: The medium is replaced daily with 1 mL of fresh mTeSR1 per well of the 12-well plate.\nAlternatives: This initial cell growing period can be shortened from a total of 4 days to 2 days. If shortened, seed 750,000 to 1.2 million dissociated cells per well of Matrigel-coated 12-well plates in the beginning. The optimal seeding density should be determined empirically in each case.\nDay 0: Aspirate the old mTeSR1 medium and add 2 mL of RPMI medium supplemented with B27 minus insulin (RPMI/B27-ins) and with 12 μM CHIR99021 (a GSK-3β inhibitor) per well of the 12-well plate.\nNote: The optimal concentration of CHIR99021 may vary a little depending on cell lines and other conditions, but it is usually 6–14 μM (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1]).\nAlternatives: 1 μM CHIR98014 can be used as a substitute for CHIR99021. The optimal concentration of CHIR98014 may vary a little depending on cell lines and other conditions but is usually 0.7–1.2 μM.\nDay 1 (24 h after the addition of CHIR99021 on day 0): Aspirate the RPMI/B27-ins medium with CHIR99021 and add 2 mL of fresh RPMI/B27-ins medium per well of the 12-well plate.\nCritical: The RPMI/B27-ins medium with CHIR99021 should be replaced into fresh RPMI/B27-ins medium without CHIR99021 precisely after 24 h.\nDay 3 (72 h after the addition of CHIR99021 on day 0): Prepare and add the semi-conditioned medium supplemented with IWP2 (a Wnt inhibitor):",
    "Collect 1 mL of the old medium per well of the 12-well plate into a 50-mL conical tube.\nAdd 1 mL of fresh RPMI/B27-ins per well into the conical tube (Mix old and fresh RPMI/B27-ins medium at a 1:1 ratio).\nAdd 2 μL of 5 mM IWP2 into 2 mL of the semi-conditioned medium from step 5b (final concentration 5 μM).\nAspirate the remaining 1 mL of the old medium per well and add 2 mL of the semi-conditioned medium supplemented with IWP2.\nAlternatives: 2 μM (working concentration) of Wnt-C59 can be used as a substitute for 5 μM IWP2.\nDay 5 (96 h after the addition of CHIR99021 on day 0): Aspirate the semi-conditioned medium with IWP2 and add 2 mL of fresh RPMI/B27-ins medium per well of the 12-well plate.\nDay 7: Aspirate the old RPMI/B27-ins medium and add 2 mL of fresh RPMI medium supplemented with B27 (RPMI/B27) per well of the 12-well plate.\nThereafter, the medium is replaced into 2 mL of fresh RPMI/B27 per well of the 12-well plate every 2 or 3 days.\nBeating cardiomyocytes start to appear in the culture, typically at day 8–9 of cardiac differentiation. Robust and broad spontaneous contractions are observed from day 10–12 onward.\nIsolation of hESC-derived cardiac subpopulations with FACS\nTiming: 5–6 h",
    "Following the in vitro cardiac differentiation as noted above, a variety of hESC-derived cardiac subpopulations that involve early MCPs to cardiac intermediates and differentiated cardiac cells can be isolated at different time points. During differentiation, ISL1+ cardiac progenitors first appear on day 3 and peak by day 6 when ISL1+ cells occupy 80%–90% of the total differentiated cells. These cells mainly differentiate into beating cardiomyocytes along with generating small subsets of other differentiated cell types, such as pacemaker, smooth muscle, and endothelial cells from day 8–10 onward. The isolation of the hESC-derived cardiac subpopulations is conducted using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and lineage-specific markers’ antibodies for cell staining on days 3 (for MCPs), 6 (for cardiac intermediates), and 10 (for differentiated cardiac cells) of the differentiation, respectively (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/472-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

The plots of cells stained with isotype controls are also shown, respectively. CI, cardiomyocyte intermediate; CM, cardiomyocyte; EC, endothelial cell; EI, endothelial intermediate; MCP, multipotent cardiac progenitor; PI, pacemaker intermediate; PM, pacemaker cell; SMC, smooth muscle cell; SMI, smooth muscle intermediate.\nOn each of the specified days (i.e., days 3, 6, and 10 of cardiac differentiation):\nAspirate the old medium on the differentiation 12-well plates and wash the cells with DPBS once.\nAdd 0.5 mL of Accutase to each well of the 12-well plate. Put the plate in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator for 5–10 min.",
    "Add 0.5 mL of mTeSR1 or FBS to each well. Collect all the cells into a 15-mL conical tube by gently pipetting.\nCentrifuge the pooled cells at 200 × g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 100 μL of DPBS.\nCount the total cell number using an automated cell counter or a hemocytometer.\nCentrifuge the cells at 200 × g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in Blocking/Staining Solution A.\nDivide the cell solution into separate 1.5 mL tubes for unstained and single color-stained controls, and multicolor-stained samples.\nNote: The cell concentration (cell number per volume) of each tube for the single color-stained controls and multicolor-stained samples should be the same (e.g., 1–2 × 106 cells per 100-200 μL of Blocking/Staining Solution A) (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.3]).\nStaining for cell surface markers:\nDo blocking of the cells in Blocking/Staining Solution A on the shaker at 4°C for 15 min.\nCentrifuge the cells at 200 × g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 100–200 μL of the primary antibodies’ solution (Blocking/Staining Solution A + appropriately diluted primary antibodies for cell surface antigens; e.g., anti-platelet derived growth factor receptor-α [PDGFRα]) (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_472_21.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_472_22.csv\nIncubate the cells on the shaker at 4°C for 30–60 min.\nCentrifuge the cells at 200 × g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C and wash the cells with 300 μL of DPBS.\nRepeat step 11e.\nCentrifuge the cells at 200 × g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C and aspirate the supernatant.\nAfter cell surface markers’ staining (step 11), one of the following steps (a, b, or c) should be adopted:",
    "If either staining for inner cell proteins or staining with a secondary antibody is not planned, resuspend the cells in 300 μL of FACS buffer and filter the cell solutions into a 5 mL FACS tube. Keep the FACS tubes on ice until detection. Go to step 18.\nNote: For live cell sorting, the cells should be stained with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; a final concentration: 0.05–0.2 μg/mL) or PI (propidium iodide; a final concentration: 2–5 μg/mL) immediately before the FACS running, so that live intact cells can be gated as DAPI- or PI-negative populations.\nIf the primary antibody used in step 11 is not conjugated with a fluorochrome, cells should be stained with a fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody (e.g., Alexa Fluor 405-, 488-, 555-, and/or 647-conjugated [Molecular Probes]; typically diluted at 1:500–1,000 in 500–1,000 μL of Blocking/Staining Solution A) specific to the appropriate species on the shaker at 4°C for 15 min. Thereafter, return to step 11e–g, and then follow either step 12a or 12c.\nIf staining for inner cell proteins is concurrently planned, go to step 13.\nNote: In the case of the isolation of hESC-derived cardiac subpopulations described here, the step 12c should be adopted because the progenitor marker ISL1 is an inner cell protein and requires cell fixation for staining.\nFix the cells with a 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution on the shaker at 20°C–25°C for 20–25 min. Wrap the cell tubes in aluminum foil.\nNote: After cells are once stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies, protect the cells from the light at all times.",
    "Critical: Prepare all the buffers and solutions at and after fixation (in steps 13–18) to be supplemented with a RNase inhibitor (e.g., RNaseOUT Ribonuclease inhibitor [Thermo Fisher]) at a 1:100 ratio for effective RNA extraction from the fixed and FACS-sorted cells. This is also applied to PBS used for cell washing (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.5]).\nCentrifuge the cells at 400 × g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.

    "Centrifuge the cells at 400 × g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C. Aspirate the supernatant, and resuspend the cells in 300 μL of FACS buffer. Filter the cell solutions into a 5 mL FACS tube. Keep the FACS tubes on ice until detection.\nCritical: For the appropriate gating strategy at FACS, the following stained controls should be prepared in addition to unstained and single color-stained controls. Run and analyze all these controls with samples at the same time (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.3]):\nIsotype primary antibody (derived from the same species and immunoglobulin type)-stained control(s) (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1])\nOnly the secondary antibody-stained control(s)\nPositively and negatively stained cell-type control(s) (For example, undifferentiated hESCs are often used for the latter.)\nAnalyze and sort the stained cells using a flow cytometer and cell sorter (e.g., FACSARIA III [BD Biosciences]) equipped with a 100 μm nozzle at 4°C temperature. Keep the flow rate between 800–1,200 events per second.\nUse the unstained and single color-stained controls to set appropriate PMT voltages and adjust compensation using a cell analyzing software (e.g., FACS Diva [BD Biosciences]).\nGate single cells with the FSC-A versus SSC-A plot, the FSC-W versus FSC-H plot, and the SSC-W versus SSC-H plot to discard cell debris and doublets (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). When performing live cell sorting, gate DAPI- or PI-negative cell populations (see step 12a Note).\nCreate appropriate sorting gates for the samples through concurrently analyzing and referring to the isotype antibody-stained and the marker-positive or negative cell-type controls.",
    "Sort the ISL1+PDGFRα+ MCPs (day 3), the ISL1+Lin (i.e., TNNT2, HCN4, SMMHC, or PECAM1)+ cardiac intermediates (day 6), and the ISL1-Lin+ differentiated cardiac cells such as cardiomyocytes, pacemaker, smooth muscle, and endothelial cells (CM, PM, SMC, and EC; day 10) (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B–2D). Sort more than 10,000 (preferably, ≥20,000) fixed cells of each population into pre-coated 1.5 mL tubes containing 100 μL of PBS (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.5]).\nImmediately after sorting, centrifuge the cells in 1.5 mL tubes at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C and aspirate the supernatant.

Set and keep the thermal cycler at 4°C after the reaction terminated.",
    "Pause Point: The PCR products can be stored in a freezer at −20°C for 1–2 months until the following procedures.\nPCR purification: Purify the PCR products using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter):\nEquilibrate AMPure XP beads at 20°C–25°C for 15 min. Then, vortex well.\nAdd 25 μL of AMPure XP beads (1:1 ratio) to each sample from step 41. Mix the reaction by pipetting and transfer the solutions to a 96-well plate.\nIncubate the mixture for 8 min at 20°C–25°C.\nPlace the 96-well plate on the magnetic stand (e.g., Magnetic Stand-96 [Ambion]) for 5 min.\nDiscard the clear liquid carefully.\nWash the beads with 200 μL of 80% ethanol solution.

Finally, transfer 15 μL of the clear supernatant into a new 1.5-mL polyallomer tube.",
    "Quality check of the final cDNA library: Measure the concentration of each library by a Qubit High-Sensitivity DNA kit and a Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.thermofisher.com/se/en/home/industrial/spectroscopy-elemental-isotope-analysis/molecular-spectroscopy/fluorometers/qubit/qubit-fluorometer.html[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/se/en/home/industrial/spectroscopy-elemental-isotope-analysis/molecular-spectroscopy/fluorometers/qubit/qubit-fluorometer.html]). Check the size distribution of the tagmented library using a High-Sensitivity DNA chip and a Bioanalyzer (Agilent).\nNote: The expected size of the tagmented library is around 300–900 bp (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nLibrary pooling:\nCalculate the molarity of the final library using the concentration obtained with the Qubit system and the average library size obtained with the Bioanalyzer (from step 47).\nDilute each library to a final concentration of 4 nM. Pool equal nanomoles of each sample, confirming that none of them has the same combination of Index 1 (N7xx) and Index 2 (N5xx) adapters.\nMeasure again the concentration and the library size distribution of the pooled libraries by the Qubit and Bioanalyzer systems. Adjust the concentration to 4 nM, if necessary.\nNote: After this step, the constructed cDNA library is ready for sequencing. Perform single-end or paired-end sequencing of the libraries using a next-generation sequencer (e.g., HiSeq 2500 [Illumina]; http://www.illumina.com/[href=http://www.illumina.com/]) according to the manufacturer’s and the sequence core facility’s instructions.\nExpected outcomes",
    "By applying the cardiac differentiation protocol (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) and the multicolor cell separation approach with lineage-specific markers’ antibodies (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]), each of the stage-specific cardiac lineages, such as the ISL1+PDGFRα+ MCPs (day 3), the ISL1+Lin (i.e., TNNT2, HCN4, SMMHC, or PECAM1)+ cardiac intermediates (day 6), and the ISL1−Lin+ differentiated cardiac cells (CM, PM, SMC, and EC) (day 10) can be isolated via FACS (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Under successful cardiac differentiation, while a great number of cells (e.g., approximately 1–2 million cells from one 12-well culture plate) of the cardiomyocyte lineage (ISL1+TNNT2+ [day 6] and ISL1−TNNT2+ [day 10]) can be sorted, around 10,000 cells in each of the other minor populations (i.e., pacemaker, smooth muscle, and endothelial lineages) can be sorted from one 12-well culture plate. Using the RNA extraction protocol described here, we usually observe the good quality of RNA profiles from more than 10,000 (preferably, ≥20,000) fixed and FACS-sorted cells in each population (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). With the heart digestion and isolation approach (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) in this protocol, followed by the cDNA library construction procedure with the Smart-Seq2, the good quality of cDNA library profiles can be obtained from 500–1,000 single cardiac cells derived from one human embryonic/fetal heart (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). At the end of this protocol, the population and single-cell libraries are ready for sequencing. After sequencing and getting raw sequenced FASTQ files, downstream bioinformatics analysis will allow us to uncover developmental cellular hierarchies and a molecular atlas of individually specified cells in more detail through combining both the population and single-cell transcriptomic data (Sahara et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). The approach described here could be applicable to the studies investigating not only cardiogenesis but also other organs’ development in human embryogenesis.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/472-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.
