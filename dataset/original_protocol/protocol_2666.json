Transversal sectioning of the chick NT will lead to a visualization of the centrosomes forming the basal body of the protruding primary cilia localized at the NPCs apical endfeet lining the entire NT lumen.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] Open-book NT will lead to an en-face view of the NPCs apical endfeet with a better visualization of centrosomes duplication in coordination with cell-cycle progression before the entry into mitosis.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]\nNT isolation from chick embryos and tissue fixation.\nEmbryos dissection:\nRemove the eggs form the incubator.\nWith long and thin tip scissors, cut around the vascular area and remove the embryo from the egg using forceps or a small spoon.\nPlace it in 1× PBS in a Petri dish under a dissecting microscope.\nRemove the extraembryonic membranes by gently scraping using fine forceps.\nWhole embryos can be fixed here, by replacing the 1× PBS with ice cold methanol and incubating for 16 h at −20°C.\nCritical: Methanol is highly toxic. Make sure to work under the hood and use appropriate personal protective equipment, particularly nitrile gloves, safety goggles and lab coat. Gloves are changed as soon as they are contaminated.",
    "After 16 h incubation, carefully pour off cold methanol and replace it with 1× PBS.\nPause point: Embryos can be stored at 4°C up to one week after fixation.\nNT transversal sections (Option 1).\nNote: All the following steps should be performed under a dissecting microscope.\nPrepare the agarose/saccharose solution (0.5% low-melt agarose 1% saccharose in H2O) and keep it molten in a warm bath for block preparation.\nPlace the embryos in 1× PBS in a Petri dish and remove the head and the heart by gently scraping with fine forceps.\nWith fine forceps, cut through the NT at the level of the wing bud caudal to the limb bud and transfer the embryo trunk into the plastic sectioning mold.\nNote: In case of electroporation, use fine forceps under a fluorescent dissecting microscope to isolate the electroporated part between the wing and the limb bud.\nPlace molten agarose/saccharose solution into plastic sectioning mold.\nNote: Avoid embedding the tissue in overheated agarose /saccharose solution. This could damage tissue integrity, denaturate endogenous proteins and thus affect the efficiency of the immunostaining.\nNote: The agarose/saccharose solution remains fluid at 37°C and will set rapidly at temperatures below 25°C.\nUse fine forceps to lift and orient all NTs in parallel and flat on their ventral side in the agarose (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C, left panel).\nOnce the agarose is hardened, use a flat surface tool, such as a spatula, to remove the agarose block from the mold.\nCarve with a razor blade the block to remove the excess of agarose and orient it to obtain NTs in the desired transversal section plane.\nAdd a drop of super glue to the vibratome stage, place the agarose block on it and fill the vibratome stage with water (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C, middle panel).",
    "Set the parameters of the vibratome to: speed-6; frequency: 65 Hz (if applicable) thickness-50 μm and section.\nWith a thin paint brush, collect sections carefully trying to not break tissue slices and place into a 1× PBS-filled 24 multiwell plate (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C, right panel).\nPause point: If necessary, tissue slices can be stored in the dark at 4°C in 1× PBS for up to one week until ready for immunostaining.\nNT open-book preparation (option 2).\nEmbryo stabilization:\nRemove the head, the heart and limbs using spring scissors and gently scraping with fine forceps.\nNote: The somites and NT should be visible if all surrounding tissues have been removed completely.\nLay the embryo on its ventral side.\nStabilize it on a petri dish coated with PDMS by pinning at the level of the wing and the limb buds, from one side and another of the NT (using 0.20 mm insect pins), with gentle stretching (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D and 1G).\nNote: Make sure that the pins are inserted at an angle away from the embryo so that they do not interfere with the dissection.\nNT opening and dissection:\nUse a tungsten needle to gently scrap and open the dorsal part of the NT. Gently scrap longitudinally by making caudo-rostral movement along the dorsal NT (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E, 1H, 1I, 1K, and 1L).\nUse a tungsten needle to separate the somites from the NT. Gently scrap longitudinally along this line on each side of the NT (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F and 1J).\nNote: Look for a dark line between the NT and the somites to be able to separate them. Adjust the illumination angle, if necessary.\nNote: The somites should separate from the NT due to the gentle stretching of the pinned embryo.",
    "Cut the NT at the level of the wing bud and caudal to the limb bud (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F and 1J).\nLift the whole NT out of the embryo in one smooth rostral to caudal motion, using forceps.\nWith a glass pipette, transfer the open-book NT to a 200 μL PCR tube containing 1× PBS.\nNote: In case of electroporation, under a fluorescent dissecting microscope, make sure to select the H2B-RFP electroporated region (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]K–1N).\nPause point: If necessary, open-book NT can be stored in the dark at 4°C in 1× PBS for up to one week until ready for immunostaining.\nImmunohistochemistry to label centriole and primary cilia structural components\nTiming: 40 min for permeabilization and saturation (for step 4a to 4b)\nTiming: 16 h for primary antibody incubation (for step 4c)\nTiming: 2 h for secondary antibody incubation (for step 4e)\nTiming: 18 h for permeabilization and saturation (for step 5a to 5b)\nTiming: 16 h for primary antibody incubation (for step 5c)\nTiming: 16 h for secondary antibody incubation (for step 5e)\nIn this section we describe standard immunocytochemistry workflow for labeling structural proteins at the two centrioles that form one centrosome and at primary cilia. Immunohistochemistry has been performed in both, fixed NT transversal sections (option 1) and open-book preparation (option 2).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2321_4.csv\nImmunochemistry on NT transversal sections (option 1).\nNote: All the following steps are performed in a 24 multiwell plate in the dark, with a buffer volume of 300 μL.\nIncubate tissue slices in permeabilization buffer (0.1% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS) for 10 min on an orbital shaker at low speed at 20°C.\nIncubate tissue slices in the saturation buffer (1% BSA/0.1% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS) for 30 min on an orbital shaker at 20°C.",
    "Incubate for 16 h on an orbital shaker at 4°C tissue slices with primary antibodies diluted in the blocking solution (1% BSA/0.1% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS [Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]]).\nAlternatives: Incubation with primary antibody could remain over weekend on an orbital shaker at 4°C in the dark.\nThe next day, wash three times in the permeabilization buffer (0.1% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS) for 15 min each wash.\nIncubate the tissue slices with the secondary antibodies diluted at 1:500 in the blocking solution (1% BSA/0.1% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS) for 2 h on an orbital shaker at 20°C.\nWash three times with the permeabilization buffer (0.1% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS) for 15 min each wash.\nPause point: If necessary, tissue slices can be stored in the dark at 4°C in 1× PBS for up to two weeks before the next steps of the protocol.\nImmunochemistry on NT open-book preparation (option 2).\nNote: NT should be kept in the dark and requires a minimum volume of 250 μL solution for each step.\nIncubate open-book NT in permeabilization buffer (0.5% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS) for 2 h on a rotary shaker at 20°C.\nNote: As open-book preparation is 4 time thicker than a transversal section, it is required to boost permeablization by increasing the percentage of Triton X-100 which in turn will allow a better entry of the antibodies through the cell membrane deep within the tissue.\nIncubate open-book NT in saturation buffer (1% BSA/0.5% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS) for 16 h on an orbital shaker at 4°C.\nThe next day, incubate open-book NT with primary antibodies diluted at the working concentrations in the blocking solution (1% BSA/0.5% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS, Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) and incubate them 16 h, on a rotary shaker, at 4°C.",
    "Note: Incubation with primary antibodies could last to up to one week.\nThe following day, perform three 15 min washes in the permeabilization buffer (0.5% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS).\nIncubate open-book NT with the secondary antibodies in the blocking solution (1% BSA/0.5% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS) and incubate them 16 h on an orbital shaker, at 4°C.\nAfter the 16 h incubation, wash three times with the permeabilization buffer (0.5% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS), 15 min each wash.\nPause point: If necessary, open-book preparation can be stored in the dark at 4°C in 1× PBS for up to two weeks before the next steps of the protocol.\nSample preparation for NT expansion microscopy (NT-ExM)\nTiming: 3 days\nTiming: 20 min setup, 16 h incubation (for step 6)\nTiming: 30 min setup, 2–2,5 h incubation (for step 7)\nTiming: 10 min setup, 4–4,5 h incubation (for step 8)\nTiming: 10 min setup, 1 h incubation (for step 9)",
    "To analyze centrosomes/cilia protein distribution in tissue at the super-resolution level, we took advantage of ExM, a recently developed technique that improves spatial resolution by physically increasing sample size.14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13] The tissue is embedded in a polymer-based gel where polymer is cross-linked with the proteins. The tissue is then digested, leaving only the anchored proteins within the gel, which is then expanded by osmosis in multiple water baths. Several variants of the initial protocol have been published, with optimizations for analyzing centrosomes and cilia structures in cell culture.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16],15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14],16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15],17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17] Recently, ExM has started to be used to visualize centrosomes/cilia structural proteins in various tissues such as sectioned mouse olfactory epithelium and mouse retina.18[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18],19[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19] The present protocol is adapted from the Basic Protocol 2 from Asano and colleagues,6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] with practical twists optimized for NT transversal sections and open-book preparation (summary timetable in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2321-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

In case your region of interest is still located out of working distance, the gel should be cut horizontally and carefully with a scalpel.\nChamber preparation and molecular anchoring.",
    "Prepare the gelation chamber by using a suitable large container with a lid. For up to four 13 mm coverslips, a 100 mm petri dish is adequate (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D). Cover it externally with aluminum foil and the internal bottom with parafilm.\nAdd on top of the parafilm a round coverslip of 13 mm diameter (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nAdd 60 μL of 1× PBS on the coverslip.\nMaintain humidity by applying along the circular periphery of the chamber tissue paper soaked in sterile water (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D and 2E).\nTransfer NT open-book or slices on a petri dish.\nIsolate tissue slices by using tungsten needles to gently separate the tissue from the surrounding gel, under the dissection microscope (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nFor open-book NT expansion, use fine forceps to gently isolate the H2B-RFP electroporated side under a fluorescent dissecting microscope.\nUse spoon micro-spatula or handmade spoon glass micropipette to transfer the tissue to the 60 μL of 1× PBS on top of the coverslip in the gelation chamber (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nNote: Before dissection, it is important to soak the tungsten needles and spoons in horse serum to avoid tissue slices sticking and breaking.\nPrepare the anchoring solution by diluting the anchoring Reagent Stock (10 mg/mL Acryloyl-X in anhydrous DMSO) to 0.1 mg/mL in 1× PBS pH7.4.\nAfter tissue transfer to coverslip, remove the 1× PBS with a 10 μL pipette and add 60 μL of anchoring solution, ensuring that the entire surface coverslip is covered.\nPlace the lid on the humidified chamber and leave the tissue in the AcX solution 16 h in the dark at 20°C.\nNote: Make sure that the tissue is soaked in the Acryloyl-X and localized close to the coverslip.",
    "Critical: Exceeding tissue number could affect gel expansion. Up to 2 electroporated sides of open-book NT cut in 2–3 pieces or 6 transversal tissue slices (50 μm) could be loaded on the same coverslip for gelation.\nCritical: The size of the gelation chamber and the amount of anchoring and gelling solution should be scaled up or down according to the size of the open-book or tissue slice and should be at least 100-fold excess in volume.\nSample gelation.\nStart by thawing the components for the gelling solution (Monomer solution, 4HT, Ammonium Persulfate -APS and TEMED) on ice.\nMeanwhile, remove the Acryloyl-X from the coverslip and wash the tissues with 60 μL of 1× PBS twice, each time for 15 min.\nDuring the last wash, use a tungsten needle to gently reposition tissues in the center and close to the coverslip, reorient open-book NT apically facing the coverslip and drain the excess of 1× PBS.\nPrepare 60 μL of gelling buffer respecting the following order: First, add in the tube the monomer solution, 4HT, TEMED and lastly add the APS in a 47:1:1:1 ratio and vortex for a few seconds. Prepare the gelling solution immediately before use as it solidifies fast (troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec8.1]).\nCritical: To prevent premature polymerization of the gelling solution, TEMED and APS should be added to the solution last before vortexing.\nCritical: The mixed gelling solution should be kept always on ice to prevent premature gelation.\nRemove the 1× PBS from the coverslip and place the 60 μL drop of gelation buffer on the parafilm and carefully flip over the coverslip where the tissues are attached (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nIncubate tissues for 2–2.5 h at 37°C.\nCritical: Be careful not to create bubbles or air-pockets inside the gelling solution drop.\nDigestion.",
    "Prepare the digestion buffer with a final concentration of Proteinase K at 8 U/mL.\nCritical: The volume of the digestion buffer should be adjusted according to the thickness of the gel, the size of the coverslip and the size of the container (troubleshooting, problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec8.9]).\nCritical: We recommend preparing enough digestion buffer to have at least a 10-fold excess in volume compared with that of the gel.\nTake out the gelation chamber from the incubator. The gel has polymerized underneath the coverslip (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nCarefully insert flat tweezers from the side between the parafilm and the gels and gently flip the gel that remain attached to the coverslip.\nTransfer the gel and the remain attached coverslip to a 35 mm diameter well plate to proceed with the digestion step (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G).\nCritical: Since the gel will expand to about 1.5× during digestion, it is important to choose a suitably large container, such as a 35 mm diameter well plate.\nAdd 3 mL of digestion buffer for 60–70 μL gel attached to a 13 mm diameter coverslip placed inside a 35 mm diameter well plate.\nLeave the gel immersed in the digestion buffer for 4–4.5 h at 37°C in the dark (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H).\nAfter digestion, the gel is detached from the coverslip and expanded 1.5× (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I).\nAfter digestion, wash three times the gel with 1× PBS, 10 min each to remove the excess of proteinase K (troubleshooting, problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec8.9]).\nNote: Changing the incident angle of light might help to locate it inside the solution.\nAdd to the gel DAPI at 1:1000 dilution in 1× PBS for 16 h at 4°C.\nNote: Since samples become transparent during expansion, DNA staining facilitates the localization of the tissue after expansion (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]L and 2M).",
    "Pause point: if later expansion is desired, remove the digestion buffer, add enough 1× PBS to avoid dehydration, and store the gel at 4°C 16 h up to one week in the dark.\nExpansion.\nTransfer the gel to a 100 mm petri dish by inversion (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]J).\nTo start the expansion step, remove the 1× PBS with a 15 mL pipette and immerse the gel in milliQ-H2O for 20 min at 20°C.\nRepeat the milliQ-H2O washes 2 more times. The sample should be fully expanded and optically cleared prior to imaging (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]K).\nNote: The speed and extent of the expansion depends on the dish volume, wash time, number, and volume.\nNote: More washes and/or longer incubation with a higher volume of water in a larger dish will result in greater expansion. We found that optimal expansion was reached after 3 × 20 min washes in petri dishes.\nCritical: If the gel is not fully expanded, continue washing the gel with milliQ-H2O at 20°C for several rounds of 20 min, until no further expansion is observed.\nNote: Expansion can be assessed by measuring sample size before digestion and after every bath (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I and 2K). In our hands, we routinely reached a 4–5× expansion.\nFast Airyscan image acquisition and processing\nTiming: Up to 2 h per expanded tissue\nTiming: 10 min setup (for step 10)\nTiming: 30 min setup, 1 h acquisition (for step 11)",
    "Super resolution Fast Airyscan imaging acquisition was performed on fully expanded tissues using an inverted microscope. Fast Airyscan improves the resolution imaging by a factor of 1.5× and a signal to noise ration by 4× compared to standard confocal imaging.20[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20] Alternatively, any ISM capable microscope can produce fast images with high signal to noise ratio.21[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21] In this section, we describe how we prepared and imaged the expanded samples using this technique.\nSample preparation for imaging.\nUnder a dissecting microscope locate the tissue inside the gel with the use of UV light (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]L).\nUse a sharp scalpel blade to cut and select the gel containing the tissue (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]M and 2N).\nNote: Make sure to cut a reasonable size in order to easily handle it. It is important to consider the shrinkage of the gel when it will be stored again back in 1× PBS.\nPlace the gel directly onto a polylysine-coated coverslip and proceed by removing carefully the excess of water with a paper tissue.\nTransfer the gel onto the microscope stage.\nNote: Alternatively, you can place the gel within a glass bottom dish coated with polylysine. This can decrease the gel drift however it is much more challenging to flip the gel in case the tissue is out of working distance for higher magnification lenses (troubleshooting, problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec8.5]).\nNote: To avoid breaking the thin cover glass, you could use a common metal coverslip stage adaptor.\nImages acquisition.\nFirst locate and image the whole NT using a 10× dry lens with a 0.3 NA. With this lens the electroporated side of the NT is detected.\nNote: Be sure to be within the working distance as you move to higher magnification lenses (troubleshooting, problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec8.3], problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec8.5]).",
    "To identify centrosomes and cilia within the cells, switch to a 63× oil-immersion lens with a 1.4 NA and a 190 μm working distance (Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 Oil DIC M27) or a 100× oil- immersion lens with a 1.46 NA and a 110 μm working distance for superresolution imaging.\nDetermine a rectangular cropped region of interest to speed up the imaging at least 1.5× zoom with optimal XY acquisition settings.\nAcquire images with a 40 nm pixel size (Superresolution mode of FastAiryscan).\nAquire Z-slices with a step size of 0.5 μm and with the piezoelectric stage of the microscope to avoid drift during acquisition (troubleshooting, problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec8.7]).\nTake the images with a frame by frame acquisition. In the current experiment, up to 4 channels (405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm and 633 nm) were acquired with the proper filter settings, for each fluorophore (troubleshooting, problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec8.9]).\nReconstruct Raw Fast Airyscan data automatically with the Zen black software.\nNote: Once the gel is on the coverslip, imaging should be performed as soon as possible. The heat from the laser will cause the gel to begin to deposit water and shrink. In our hands, this tended to happen in 1 h.\nUse ImageJ to calculate the distances between local maxima from the intensity plot profiles on the expanded sample images (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]L).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2321-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.
