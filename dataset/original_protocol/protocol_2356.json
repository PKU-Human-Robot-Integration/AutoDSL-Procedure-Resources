    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nOutline of protocol\nHere we provide a table outlining the steps of the protocol (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1991_2.csv\nMount tissue on microscope slides or store unmounted tissue at 4°C.\nDay 1: Rinse tissue\nTiming: 25 min\nPrior to beginning immunohistochemistry (IHC), it is important to rinse tissue in 0.1 M PBS, particularly if the tissue has been previously stored in cryoprotectant.\nRinse tissue for 5 min in fresh 0.1 M PBS on a shaker.\nRepeat 5 times (use a new well plate with fresh 0.1 M PBS for each rinse).\nNote: See Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] for a demonstration of transferring tissue between wells using a paint brush. Using a paint brush for transferring tissue is more affordable than purchasing mesh well inserts (i.e., Netwell). We have also found that fragile tissue (i.e., neonatal brains, poorly perfused brains) gets caught or stuck in mesh well inserts, yet we find little to no tissue damage occurs when using a paint brush to transfer tissue.\nOptional: To better observe tissue, we prefer using dark colored porcelain spot plates, instead of clear plastic culture plates (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Additionally, the concave shape of the porcelain spot plate wells results in the need for less solution to completely cover tissue and is thus cost effective for antibody use.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1991-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Well plate options\nLeft: a coronal rodent brain section in a porcelain spot plate. Right: a coronal rodent brain section in a plastic cell culture plate. We prefer porcelain spot plates for ease of visualizing tissue and the concave shape of the wells reduces the amount of solution needed and results in less tissue damage when transferring tissue from well to well.

    "Methods video S1. Transferring tissue, related to step 1\nThis video demonstrates transferring tissue from one porcelain well plate to another using a paint brush. Mentioned in step ‘Day 1: Rinse tissue,’ but applicable throughout the protocol\nDay 1: Calculations\nTiming: 5 min\nFor this protocol, all calculations will be made for 12 wells of tissue, each well containing 5 tissue sections, each with 40 μm thickness, and 500 μL solution.\nNumber of tissue sections per well:\nDepending on brain size and tissue quality, 3–6 tissue sections can be placed in a single well. If the tissue is poorly perfused and is ‘sticky,’ place fewer sections per well.\nAmount of solution per well:\nThe total amount of solution per well can range from 350–500 μL. Scale the solution based on the number of tissue sections, such that all sections in each well are completely submerged.\nFor this protocol, a 12 well plate needs 6 mL (500 μL ×12) of solution per step (i.e., Primary, Biotin, and Secondary steps).\nDay 1: Block non-specific sites\nTiming: 1 h\nAntibodies may weakly bind nonspecifically to random proteins, thus creating noise in fluorescent signal. To reduce background staining, tissue is incubated in a blocking buffer prior to primary antibody incubation to block non-specific sites that the primary and/or secondary antibodies may bind to. The blocking buffer is made with serum from the species your secondary antibodies were raised in. For example, if you are using a donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody, you will make a blocking buffer with normal donkey serum.\nMake blocking buffer:\nMake a 1× PBS solution with 10% normal donkey serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 in a glass beaker.\nPipet 500 μL blocking buffer into each of 12 wells in a new well plate.",
    "Transfer tissue from the final PBS rinse above into the well plate containing blocking buffer.\nPlace well plate in a humid chamber and incubate at room temperature for 1 h.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1991_3.csv\nCan be made 1 day ahead and stored at 4°C.\nNote: Triton X-100 is very viscous. To avoid the Triton X-100 sticking in a clump to the bottom of a glass beaker when making the blocking buffer, mix the donkey serum in 0.1 M PBS and have a stir bar actively spinning in the solution on a stir plate. Add the Triton X-100 via a pipet directly into the solution and allow it to completely dissolve for at least 2 min. Some bubbling may occur.\nOptional: We preferentially use Normal Donkey Serum, however, Bovine Serum Albumin is commonly used with success.\nDay 1: Make diluent for primary, biotin, and secondary steps\nTiming: 20 min\nWhile the tissue incubates in the blocking buffer, make the diluent that will serve as the base for mixing antibodies in subsequent steps. The diluent helps to stabilize the antibodies, promotes diffusion into the tissue, and minimizes non-specific binding.\nMake enough diluent for each step (i.e., in this example, 6 mL is needed per step). There will always be a primary and secondary step, whereas a third biotinylation step is optional.\nMake diluent:\nMake a 1× PBS solution with 5% normal donkey serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 in a glass beaker.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1991_4.csv\nStore at 4°C for 1 week.\nNote: See note above about Triton X-100.\nDay 1: Primary antibody incubation\nTiming: 24 h",
    "There are two types of immunofluorescence assays – direct and indirect. Direct immunofluorescence uses only one fluorophore-conjugated antibody directed against the antigen of interest. Indirect immunofluorescence uses an unconjugated primary antibody that binds to the target of interest and a secondary antibody containing a fluorescent marker that is directed against the primary antibody. This protocol uses indirect immunofluorescence, and thus there are primary and secondary antibody incubation steps. Specifically, we use a primary anti-oxytocin antibody raised in a mouse, a primary anti-vasopressin antibody raised in a guinea pig, and a primary anti-Fos antibody raised in a rabbit.\nPrimary antibody concentrations:\nMouse anti-oxytocin: 1:250.\nGuinea pig anti-vasopressin: 1:1,000.\nRabbit anti-Fos: 1:500.\nMake primary antibody solution:\nMix primary antibodies into diluent.\nPipet 500 μL primary antibody solution into each of 12 wells in a new well plate.\nTransfer tissue directly from the blocking buffer into the well plate containing the primary antibody solution.\nPlace well plate in a humid chamber and incubate at 4°C for 24 h.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1991_5.csv\nCan be made 1 day ahead and stored at 4°C.\nNote: To determine antibody concentrations for the primary antibody incubation step, one can peruse the literature to identify concentrations used by other labs. If validating a new antibody (or the concentration used by other labs does not work in your tissue), we recommend conducting a pilot with the following concentrations: 1:100, 1:250, 1:500, 1:1,000. Each concentration can be run in a single well of tissue that contains 4–5 tissue sections (i.e., the pilot would use 4 wells of tissue total). Depending on results from the pilot, concentrations can be scaled up or down.",
    "Optional: For the antibodies listed here, we have conducted primary antibody incubations for 24 h and for 48 h and have found no statistical difference in cell labeling. Thus, after testing your specific primary antibodies, a 48 h incubation is potentially an option.\nDay 2: Rinse tissue\nTiming: 1 h\nRinsing the tissue after the primary antibody incubation removes unbound antibody as well as antibody that has partially bound to non-specific sites.\nRinse tissue in fresh 0.1 M PBS on a shaker.\nRinse tissue for 30 min in fresh 0.1 M PBS on a shaker.\nRepeat tissue rinsing, step 16 a.\nDay 2: Biotin incubation\nTiming: 1 h\nAntibodies that do not exhibit strong expression can be enhanced by increasing the number of fluorophores bound to the tissue. Signal amplification can be achieved by applying a biotin step. In this protocol, the guinea pig anti-vasopressin antibody from BMA Biomedicals/Peninsula Laboratories requires biotinylation for sufficient visualization in brain tissue. Thus, we use a donkey anti-guinea pig biotin, which will target and bind to the previously bound guinea pig anti-vasopressin antibody.\nBiotin concentration:\nDonkey anti-guinea pig biotin conjugated to streptavidin: 1:125.\nMake biotin solution:\nMix biotin into diluent.\nPipet 500 μL primary antibody solution into each of 12 wells in a new well plate.\nTransfer rinsed tissues into a new well plate containing the biotin solution.\nPlace well plate in a humid chamber and incubate at room temperature for 1 h.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1991_6.csv\nCan be made 1 day ahead and stored at 4°C.\nDay 2: Rinse tissue\nTiming: 30 min\nRinsing the tissue after the biotin incubation removes unbound biotin.\nRinse tissue in fresh 0.1 M PBS on a shaker.\nRinse tissue for 15 min in fresh 0.1 M PBS on a shaker.\nRepeat tissue rinsing, step 22 a.",
    "Day 2: Secondary antibody incubation\nTiming: 2 h\nBecause primary antibodies and biotin complex do not contain fluorescent markers, a secondary antibody incubation containing fluorophores is necessary to visualize antibody binding. We use a donkey anti-mouse antibody conjugated with the Alexa Fluor 680 dye to bind to and visualize the mouse anti-oxytocin antibody to visualize oxytocin cells in the far red (not visible to the naked eye). A donkey anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with the Alexa Fluor 594 antibody is used to bind to and visualize the rabbit anti-Fos antibody to visualize Fos cells in red. Finally, because there is an extraordinary affinity of avidin for biotin (Chivers et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), a streptavidin with the Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate is used to bind to and visualize the anti-guinea pig biotin, which previously bound to the guinea pig anti-vasopressin primary antibody; vasopressin will thus be visualized in green.\nSecondary antibody concentrations:\nDonkey anti-mouse 680: 1:150.\nDonkey anti-rabbit 594: 1:300.\nStreptavidin 488: 1:300.\nMake secondary antibody solution:\nMix secondary antibodies into diluent at the concentrations suggested in step 23.\nPipet 500 μL primary antibody solution into each of 12 wells in a new well plate.\nTransfer tissue from the rinse into the well plate containing the secondary antibody solution.\nPlace well plate in a humid chamber in the dark (i.e., a cupboard) at room temperature for 2 h.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1991_7.csv\nCan be made 1 day ahead and stored at 4°C (in the dark; wrapped in foil).\nOptional: We have used Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary antibodies in 350, 488, 594, 647, and 680 nano meter (nm) wavelengths for primary antibodies generated in mouse, guinea pig, rabbit, and goat with great success.",
    "Note: Regardless of the primary antibody, we use the same concentrations for Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies based on the fluorophore. For example, here we used a donkey anti-rabbit 594 antibody at a concentration of 1:300 to label Fos. A donkey anti-mouse 594 antibody to label oxytocin would also have a concentration of 1:300.\nCritical: Keep secondary antibody solution covered from light. The beaker of solution can be wrapped in foil. The well plates with solution should be covered with a box lid. Although fluorescent antibodies should be protected from light, we have found that Alexa Fluor antibodies can withstand periods of direct light without affecting signal. Therefore, it is not necessary to conduct immunohistochemistry with the lights off.\nDay 2: Rinse tissue\nTiming: 20 min\nRinsing the tissue after the secondary antibody incubation removes unbound antibody, thus improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).\nRinse tissue in fresh 0.1 M PBS on a shaker. Cover well plate with a box lid to protect from light.\nRinse tissue for 10 min in fresh 0.1 M PBS on a shaker. Cover well plate with a box lid to protect from light.\nRepeat tissue rinsing, step 28a.\nAt this stage, tissues can be directly mounted to microscope slides or stored in 0.1 M PBS solution in a well plate inside a humid chamber at 4°C for up to 1 week.\nMount tissue on microscope slides\nTiming: 30+ min\nWe mount stained tissue onto subbed slides to enhance adhesion of the tissue to the slide. Non-subbed slides can be subbed by applying a gelatin-coating. We use Trubond 380 Adhesion slides that come pre-subbed and are ready for use. Once tissue sections are mounted to slides, slides are then coverslipped and allowed to dry for 24 h. Slides are then sealed and are ready for imaging.",
    "Mount tissue on slides:\nDistribute tissue across 0.1 M PBS-filled well plates such that there is a single tissue section per well.\nUsing a paint brush held parallel to the well plate, gently slide the brush underneath the tissue.\nSlowly lift the paint brush such that the lateral sides of the tissue each fold around the paint brush.\nHolding the paint brush parallel to the slide, press the right side of the paint brush to the slide and slowly roll the brush clockwise.\nNote: The tissue section should roll off the paint brush and onto the slide.\nUse a 0.1 M PBS-saturated paint brush to gently move the tissue so that it lies completely flat on the slide.\nNote: We refer to this as the ‘pancake method’ because the paint brush acts as a spatula to scoop under the tissue, and then the tissue is flipped onto the slide. See Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2] for a demonstration.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2. Mounting tissue onto microscope slides method 1, related to step 30b\nThis video demonstrates the pancake method for mounting brain tissue onto a subbed microscope slide. Mentioned under the step “Mount tissue on microscope slides.”\nAs an alternative to step 30b, a paint brush can be used to push the tissue to the side of a well of 0.1 M PBS.\nScrunch the tissue onto the paint brush using a sweeping motion as the brush sweeps along the side of the well to bring the tissue out.\nUse a second paint brush, saturated in 0.1 M PBS, to scoot the tissue off the first paint brush onto the slide.\nUse the brushes to unfurl the tissue on the slide.",
    "Note: If using this method, ensure the tissue is well perfused so that it can withstand scrunching/folding and gentle tugging with paint brushes when flattening the tissue on the slide. We also recommend using sufficient amounts of 0.1 M PBS for this method. See Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3] for a demonstration.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S3. Mounting tissue onto microscope slides method 2, related to step 30c\nThis video demonstrates an alternative paint brush method for mounting brain tissue onto a subbed microscope slide. Mentioned under the step “Mount tissue on microscope slides.”\nCoverslip slides:\nAllow tissue sections to dry.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1991-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Tissue drying stages prior to coverslipping microscope slides\nLeft: An example of a tissue section on a slide that is too wet and has not yet sufficiently dried for coverslipping. Right: An example of a tissue section that has dried sufficiently to adhere to the slide and appears crystalline; this tissue section is ready for coverslipping. Scale bar represents 1.25 mm.\nNote: All tissue sections on a slide must partially dry in order to fully adhere to the slide. Tissue sections begin to appear crystalline and sparkly when they are partially dried (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nCritical: Ensure that all individual tissue sections reach the crystalline stage once prior to moving to the next step.\nRewet tissue by gently dabbing 0.1 M PBS onto the tissue section with a paint brush.\nNote: This aids in evenly spreading the mounting media across the slide.\nPipet ∼3 drops of the mounting medium (we use Prolong Gold with DAPI) evenly across the slide.\nGently place the left side of a coverslip onto the left side of the slide and use forceps to slowly lower the right side of the coverslip onto the slide. See Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4].",
    "Note: Once the coverslip is on the slide, it should not be removed because the tissue will un-adhere from the slide and likely tear. If tissue sections substantially slide and overlap one another, the entire slide, including the coverslip, can be immediately placed into a dish of 0.1 M PBS. With the slide submerged, gently slide the coverslip off; all tissue will detach and float in the dish. The mounting process can then be started anew.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S4. Coverslipping slides, related to step 31d\nThis video demonstrates the application of a coverslip onto a microscope slide containing mounting-media covered brain tissue. The slide contains one tissue section (top left) that did not sufficiently dry and adhere to the slide, and thus this tissue section can be observed to float on the slide as the coverslip is lowered. Tissue sliding can be avoided by allowing the slide sufficient time to dry prior to coverslipping. Mentioned under the step “Mount tissue on microscope slides.”\nPlace coverslipped slides on a paper towel under a box lid to dry for 24 h.\nSeal coverslipped slides:\nAfter slides have been coverslipped for 24 h, apply clear nail polish around the edges of the coverslip to seal the gap between the coverslip and the slide.\nSlides are ready for imaging and can be stored at room temperature in light-blocking slide boxes. We have successfully stored slides in boxes at room temperature for 15+ years. Note that some antibodies may lose their fluorescence over time.\nNote: For smaller brains (vole, mouse, finch), we prefer using the Princeton flat shader 4 paint brush. For larger brains (i.e., gerbil and rat), we prefer the Princeton flat shader 6 paint brush.",
    "Optional: There are numerous methods for mounting free-floating tissue sections onto slides. An additional alternative is to have a small dish of 0.1 M PBS with tissue sections floating in it. The slide is then held mostly parallel to the water and slightly submerged; the tissue is then scooted onto the slide with a paint brush.\nCritical: We prefer to mount tissue using desktop stereo microscopes (e.g., Labomed 4141000 Model Luxeo 2S Binocular Stereo Microscope, 10×/30× Magnification). It is critical to ensure that no tissue is folded over onto itself or overlaps with other sections of tissue; tissue overlap will result in difficulties with region-specific imaging."
