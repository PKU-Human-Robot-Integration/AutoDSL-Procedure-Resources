    "1. Preparation of Reagents\nMake 18.5% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution. Add 0.925 g of PFA, 4.8 mL of water (use ultrapurified water throughout the protocol) and 35 µL of 1 M KOH in a 50 mL conical plastic tube. Close the cap tightly and heat the tube in a 400-600 mL glass beaker containing approximately 200 mL of water using a microwave. Remove the tube before the water starts boiling and vortex the tube to dissolve PFA. Allow PFA to cool to room temperature and store on ice.\nNOTE: Repeat heating and mixing until PFA dissolves completely. Prepare PFA solution immediately before crosslinking (step 2.1.3).\nMake 1.25 M glycine solution. Dissolve 14.07 g of glycine in 150 mL of water and filter through a 0.22 µm pore-size filter. Store at 4 °C.\nMake ChIP cell lysis buffer. Dissolve 378 mg of PIPES, 10.6 mL of 2 M KCl, and 1.25 g of branched octylphenoxy poly(ethyleneoxy)ethanol in water. Adjust pH to 8.0 with 1 M KOH at 4 °C and make up to 250 mL. Filter through a 0.22 µm pore-size filter and store at 4 °C.\nMake micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion buffer. To make 1 mL, mix 0.1 mL of 10x MNase digestion buffer, 10 µL of 100x BSA solution, 10 µL of 0.1 M dithiothreitol and 0.88 mL of water.\nMake 1 M NaHCO3. Dissolve 4.2 g of NaHCO3 in 50 mL of water and filter through a 0.22 µm pore-size filter. Store at room temperature.\nMake 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Dissolve 5 g of SDS in 50 mL of water. Store at room temperature.\nMake elution buffer. Mix 15 µL of 1 M NaHCO3, 15 µL of 10% SDS, and 120 µL of water to obtain 150 µL of elution buffer for one sample.",
    "NOTE: Increase the volumes proportionally depending on the number of samples.\nMake 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) solution. Dissolve 24.6 g of sodium acetate anhydrous in water. Adjust pH to 5.2 with acetic acid and make up 100 mL. Filter through a 0.22 µm pore-size filter and store at room temperature.\n2. Determination of MNase Digestion Conditions\nNOTE: In the step 2 of protocol, an example using VCaP, human prostate cancer cells is presented. Any mammalian cell lines can be used; see Note at the steps.\nPreparation of crosslinked chromatin\nMaintain VCaP cells in DME-high glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in a carbon dioxide incubator. Seed VCaP cells at 4 x 106 cells in six 6 cm dishes in 4 mL of culture media and culture for 3 days.\nNOTE: Use appropriate culture media for each cell line. Up to 10 x 106 cells can be seeded in a 6 cm or 10 cm dish. For suspended cells, seed cells in T25 flasks. The number of dishes or flasks depends how many doses are tested for MNase digestion. If 4 doses are tested, prepare 6 dishes or flasks. See also step 2.2.\nDetach VCaP cells from one dish using trypsin and count the cell. Calculate cell number in one dish. For suspended cells, remove a small amount of cell suspension from one flask and count cell number.\nAdd 0.229 mL of 18.5% PFA to a 6 cm dish in 4 mL of culture media at a final concentration of 1%. Gently but thoroughly swirl a dish or flask to distribute PFA evenly. Incubate at room temperature for exactly 10 min.",
    "NOTE: In this step, chromatin and proteins are crosslinked. As PFA is toxic, carry out this step in a chemical fume hood and use proper personal protective equipment.\nAfter 10 min, add 0.47 mL of 1.25 M glycine solution at a final concentration of 125 mM. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\nNOTE: Glycine neutralizes excess PFA to stop further crosslinking.\nAspirate formaldehyde/glycine/culture media. Wash the cells by adding 4 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) twice. For suspended cells, transfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Aspirate the supernatant and add one medium volume of PBS and fully suspend. Repeat this step. Dispose liquid wastes properly since they contain formaldehyde.\nPrepare PBS containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (PIC) by adding 1/100 volume of 100x PIC to PBS. Aspirate PBS from a dish and add 1 mL per dish of PBS containing PIC. Scrape the cells and transfer the cell suspension to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. For suspended cells, simply transfer the suspension to a 1.5 mL tube.\nCentrifuge tubes at 3,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature to recover the cell pellet. Remove the PBS completely using a pipette. Record the cell number per tube and store the cell pellet at -80 °C.\nCell lysis and MNase digestion\nNOTE: The reagent volume in the following steps is based on one tube containing 6 x 106 cells. Adjust reagent volume proportionally depending on cell number; when one tube contains 2 x 106 cells, use 100 µL of ChIP cell lysis buffer (step 2.2.1), MNase digestion buffer (step 2.2.3), and ChIP dilution buffer (step 2.2.5), and 10 µL of 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0) (step 2.2.4).",
    "Thaw the stored cell pellet (VCaP cells, containing 6 x 106 cells per tube) prepared in step 2.1.7 on ice. Prepare ChIP cell lysis buffer supplemented with PIC by adding 1/100 volume of 100x PIC to the buffer. Add 300 µL of ChIP cell lysis buffer supplemented with PIC and resuspend the pellet thoroughly. Vortex the tube for 15 s and incubate the suspension on ice for 10 min.\nCentrifuge at 9,000 x g for 3 min at 4 °C and remove the supernatant completely. Resuspend the pellet in 300 µL of MNase digestion buffer.\nDilute MNase (2,000 gel unit/µL) with MNase digestion buffer to give 50 gel units/µL. Add 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 µL of 50 gel units/µL of MNase to the suspension and incubate at 37 °C for exactly 10 min, mixing by inversion every 2.5 min.\nNOTE: Table 1 shows optimal amounts of MNase in several cell lines.\nAdd 30 µL of 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0) to terminate MNase digestion and vortex briefly. Incubate for 5 min on ice. Centrifuge at 9,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and remove the supernatant completely.\nPrepare ChIP dilution buffer supplemented with PIC by adding 1/100 volume of 100x PIC to the buffer. Resuspend the pellet in 300 µL of ChIP dilution buffer supplemented with PIC.\nSonicate the suspension on ice using a sonicator equipped with a microtip probe. Use the following sonication conditions: amplitude 2, processed time 15 s, pulse ON 5 s, pulse OFF 30 s. Take 1 µL of the suspension and spot onto a slide glass and observe them using a microscope. Ensure that the cell structure is almost broken.",
    "NOTE: Figure 1A shows representative microphotographs of the VCaP cell suspension before and after sonication. This step is for releasing digested chromatin into the supernatant by breaking nuclear membranes. A power setting should be adjusted to less than 5% of maximum power and try sonication for 5 s three times with more than a 30 s interval. If wattage control is available, adjust power setting to 5 W and process the samples for total 15 s as mentioned above to give total power of 70-75 J. Check whether the cell structure is broken as mentioned above. If not enough, repeat one more time. The condition described above is practically applied to all cell lines tested.\nCentrifuge at 9,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C, transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, and save 20 µL of the digested chromatin for step 2.3. Store the remainder at -80 °C.\nReverse crosslinking, purification of DNA, and analysis of digested chromatin\nAdd 75 µL of water, 4 µL of 5 M NaCl, and 1 µL of proteinase K to a 1.5 mL screw tube. Add 20 µL of digested chromatin from various MNase digestion conditions prepared in step 2.2.7 to tubes containing water, NaCl, and proteinase K. Close the cap tightly, mix completely, and incubate the tube at 65 °C overnight.\nNOTE: This step is for the removal of crosslinking between protein and DNA.\nPrepare two 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tubes per condition. Add 100 µL of phenol:chloroform:isoamylalcohol (25:24:1) (PCI) to one 1.5 mL tube. Add 10 µL of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 2 µL of glycogen to another tube.\nNOTE: The use of chloroform:isoamylalcohol is not necessary7. Increasing volume may result in low DNA recovery after ethanol precipitation8.",
    "Centrifuge the tube containing digested chromatin from step 2.3.1 briefly and add 100 µL of PCI. Close the cap tightly, and vortex vigorously to form emulsion. Centrifuge the tube at maximum speed (e.g., 20,000 x g) for 30 s at room temperature.\nCarefully take the upper phase containing DNA and add to the tube containing PCI prepared in step 2.3.2. Vortex vigorously and centrifuge the tube as step 2.3.3.\nNOTE: If lower phase is contaminated, centrifuge the tube again, or remove most of the lower phase first, centrifuge the tube, and take the upper phase.\nCarefully take the upper phase as described in step 2.3.4 and add to the tube containing sodium acetate and glycogen prepared in step 2.3.2. Add 250 µL of ethanol. Mix by inversion and incubate for 10 min at room temperature. Centrifuge the tube at maximum speed (e.g., 20,000 x g) for 30 min at 4 °C.\nNOTE: Incubation of the solution at room temperature does not affect DNA recovery8,9.\nConfirm the pellets on the bottom of the tube. Carefully remove the supernatant so as not to disturb the pellet and add 500 µL of 70% ethanol. Centrifuge the tube at maximum speed (e.g., 20,000 x g) for 5 min at 4 °C.\nRemove the supernatant completely and dry the pellet for approximately 5 min at room temperature. Dissolve the pellet in 20 µL of 10 mM Tris·HCl/1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) (TE). Measure DNA concentration using a UV spectrophotometer.\nMix 0.5 µg of DNA with a gel loading dye and apply to 2% agarose gel. Electrophorese the samples at 100 V in tris-acetate-EDTA buffer until purple dye migrated to the two-third of the gel and stain a gel with 0.5 µg/mL ethidium bromide for 10 min. Take a picture of the gel.",
