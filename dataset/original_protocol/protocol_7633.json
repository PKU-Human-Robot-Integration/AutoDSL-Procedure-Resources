    "Preparing cancer cell cultures for reprogramming Note: This protocol is performed in sterile conditions under a class 2 laminar flow hood, using sterile pipettes, materials, and reagents. Procedures A–C from this protocol were performed using B16 and 88MEL murine and human melanoma cell lines but can be extended to other types of cancer cell lines and primary samples, including adherent and non-adherent cells (Zimmermannova et al., 2023). Cancer cell lines and primary samples can be bought from ATCC, Riken, AMSBio, BioIVT, or VitroBiopharma, among other commercial sources. Alternatively, cancer biopsies can be isolated, processed, and expanded for reprogramming experiments.Thaw and culture cancer cells in the recommended culture media for the cell type under standard conditions (37 °C, 5% CO2). It is recommended that cells are passaged at least once before plating for reprogramming. For better reproducibility when using the same cell line, ensure that the passage is similar between reprogramming experiments.Before reprogramming, ensure the cells are dividing normally and display usual morphology by using an inverted light microscope regularly.Using a hemocytometer, count cells and expand them as follows:For adherent cells, plate 1 × 106 live cells per 100 mm tissue culture plate.Note: This step can be adjusted according to the purpose of the experiment. To assess reprogramming efficiency or immunophenotyping during reprogramming, 6-well plates are recommended. For functional assays or in vivo studies, it is recommended to use 100 mm or 150 mm plates. Adjust cell numbers according to the surface area. For non-adherent cells, skip to step B2.Allow cells to adhere by incubating at 37 °C, 5% CO2 overnight (approximately 16 h), and proceed with reprogramming (Procedure B).Tumor-APC reprogramming Before starting this protocol, prepare lentiviruses as previously described (Rosa et al., 2020 and 2022). The lentiviral vectors for expression of PU.",
    "1, IRF8, and BATF3 individually in inducible vectors can be found in Addgene and can be subcloned into any backbone as individual factors or in a polycistronic cassette by adding self-cleaving 2A sequences between sequences.Titer viral concentrates by qRT-PCR to determine their concentration in viral particles/mL using, for example, Lenti-X qRT-PCR titration kit (see Reagents). This will require viral RNA isolation from supernatant before qRT-PCR reaction to quantify viral RNA content. Calculating viral particles per milliliter of viral supernatant does not provide functional titration, but it ensures reproducibility even when using virus lacking a fluorescent protein. Alternatively, functional titration by FACS can be performed based on eGFP expression and calculating transducing units per milliliter.The reprogramming process can be done in multiple cell culture media. Use the appropriate media for culturing the cancer cell type of choice throughout reprogramming. B16 were cultured in complete DMEM and 88MEL in complete RPMI (see Recipes 1 and 2).Pre-warm appropriate volume of cell culture media for 5 min at 37 °C.Cancer cell transduction is performed as described below for adherent (2a) and non-adherent cells (2b):To transduce adherent cells seeded in a 100 mm tissue culture plate (Procedure A, Figure 1):i. Resuspend the volume necessary containing of 4 × 104 viral particles per cell in 10 mL.Note: The range of 4 × 104 viral particles per cell is optimal for B16 and 88MEL cancer cell lines and can be used as a starting point for similar cell types. However, it is recommended to evaluate the optimal multiplicity of infection (MOI) for efficient reprogramming without affecting cell viability for each individual cell cancer cell type.",
    "This is performed by testing increasing viral titers or volumes with known number of particles (determined by qRT-PCR) and assessing transduction efficiency at day 3 and reprogramming efficiency at day 9 (Figure 1). Optimal transduction efficiency with eGFP lentivirus is approximately 70%–80% at day 3. If the lentivirus lacks a fluorescent reporter, reprogramming efficiency can be assessed at day 9 by flow cytometric analysis using CD45 and MHC-II as read-out. ii. Add 10 mL of polybrene solution to 10 mL of transduction media prepared in the previous step (final concentration: 8 mg/mL, see Recipe 5).iii. Scale volume of transduction media, lentivirus particles, and polybrene according to the number of plates and plated cells.iv. Incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h in transduction media. Proceed to step B3.To transduce non-adherent cells:i. Resuspend cells in an adequate volume of media to a final density of 1 × 106 cells/mL.ii. Add optimized MOI of lentiviral particles for the cell type of choice followed by polybrene (final concentration: 8 mg/mL) to the cell suspension.iii. Dispense 2 mL of cell suspension per well in a non-tissue-culture-treated 6-well plate.Note: Non-adherent cells may require higher viral load for efficient reprogramming. It is recommended that viruses are titrated before this step (see note in previous step). iv. Perform spin infection by centrifugation at 800× g for 1 h at room temperature.v. After centrifugation, resuspend the cells and incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h in transduction media.Change media of transduced cells.For adherent cultures, aspirate supernatant and carefully add media on top of the cells.Note: Cautiously dispense media at low speed by adjusting settings in a pipette aid to avoid displacing transduced cells, especially semi-adherent cells. For non-adherent cells, transfer cell suspension to a 50 mL centrifuge tube.",
    "Centrifuge cell suspension for 5 min at 350× g at room temperature, before resuspending cells in adequate media volume for a final density of 1 × 106 cells/mL.At day 3, observe cells under an inverted light microscope.Note: Reprogramming-associated cell death is expected after transduction and during the first days of reprogramming (approximately 10%), which can be variable among different cell lines. If transduced cancer cells in a 100 mm tissue culture plate reach 80% confluency at day 3, aspirate media, wash with room-temperature PBS, and add 1.5 mL of TrypLE Express. Incubate for the minimum amount of time needed until all cells have lifted (minimum 3 min). Resuspend cells in 7 mL of their usual fresh culture media and centrifuge at 350× g for 5 min at room temperature. Aspirate media and resuspend cells in 60 mL to passage 1:6 (i.e., to plate in 6 × 100 mm tissue culture plates). For large experiments, an 80% confluent 100 mm tissue culture plate can be divided into 3 × 150 mm tissue culture plates.Note: Cell dilution can be adjusted according to cancer cell line of choice and experimental setup. Fast replicating cells can be diluted in 1:6 or 1:8 ratios. Slow dividing cells should be diluted in 1:3 or 1:4 ratios to avoid over dilution. If transduced cancer cells are not 80% confluent and flow cytometric analysis will not be performed, just change media as in step B3.For non-adherent cells, transfer cell suspension to a 50 mL centrifuge tube and count cells. Centrifuge at 350× g for 5 min at room temperature followed by resuspension in adequate volume of fresh media for a final density of 1 × 106 cells/mL.Transduction efficiency can be measured at day 3 of reprogramming by flow cytometric analysis of eGFP expression.",
    "Perform step B4a and collect 0.5–1 mL out of 7 mL of cell suspension for flow cytometric analysis in step B4e. Divide the remaining cells evenly on 100 mm or 150 mm plates according to dilution ratio.Flow cytometric analysis at day 3: Divide the cell suspension collected in step B4d evenly in a sufficient number of round-bottom polystyrene tubes to include single color (SC) controls and fluorescence minus one (FMO) control to assess expression of other markers along with eGFP (i.e., CD45, MHC-II, and MHC-I) and establish the optimal fluorochrome panel and compensation settings. See Table 1 for an example of number of tubes and their contents for flow cytometric analysis of eGFP expression combined with surface staining for CD45, MHC-II, and MHC-I. Note that, by using a fluorescent tag protein like eGFP, all single-color staining will include eGFP as well and FMO eGFP cannot be done unless panel establishment is performed using vectors without eGFP. If measurements are done on the same machine, compensation settings are only required to be performed once during reprogramming, generally at day 5 post-transduction when marker expression is more intense (see step B6).Table 1.

    "Change media every 2–3 days, according to the color of the media and cell confluency until the endpoint of reprogramming.Note: For cancer cells with high doubling rates, replace media every 24 h. Do not let cells reach >80% confluency, as high confluency levels result in low pH, altered metabolism, and mechanical stress that may affect the reprogramming process. Whenever 80% confluency is reached, split cells according to step 4a. For non-adherent cells, maintain cell density between 1 × 106 and 2 × 106 cells/mL during the reprogramming process. The emergence of tumor-APCs can be assessed at days 5, 8, and 9 post-transduction by flow cytometric analysis.For adherent cancer cells:i. Aspirate media, wash with 3 mL of room-temperature PBS, and dissociate cells with 1.5 mL TrypLE Express per plate followed by incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 3 min (or until all cells have lifted from the plate).ii. Harvest cells by resuspending them with 3 mL per 100 mm plate of cold MACS buffer (see Recipe 4, keep it at 4 °C) and transferring the resultant cell suspension to a conical 50 mL centrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 350× g for 5 min at 4 °C.iii. Discard supernatant and resuspend a pellet equivalent to a 100 mm tissue culture plate in 3 mL of MACS buffer.For non-adherent cells:i. Resuspend the cells using serological pipettes and transfer culture suspension to a 50 mL centrifuge tube.ii. Count cell number using a hemocytometer before centrifuging at 400× g for 5 min at 4 °C.iii. Resuspend non-adherent cell cultures in an adequate volume of cold MACS buffer for a final concentration of 1 × 106 cells/mL.Cells are now ready for downstream analysis by flow cytometry, FACS-based purification for fluorescence microscopy, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq), or MACS-enrichment.",
    "Divide cell suspension evenly into 3–11 round-bottom tubes to assess stained and unstained samples. Include SC and FMO controls if it is the first time doing flow cytometric analysis (see step B4e and Table 1 for examples). CD45, MHC-II, and MHC-I can be used for FACS purification.Reprogramming of cancer cells can be evaluated by RNA-seq data by quantifying mRNA expression of endogenous PU.1, IRF8, and BATF3, as well as antigen presentation genes and TLR genes (see Data analysis).Purifying tumor-APCs for functional assays by MACS-enrichment The MACS protocol here described was optimized for adherent murine melanoma cells using Miltenyi Biotec LS columns and MidiMACS separators. Further optimizations for different cancer cell types might be needed.For experiments requiring large numbers of reprogrammed cancer cells, it is recommended to perform MACS-enrichment ensuring feasibility of the experiment and viability of the reprogrammed population. For experiments requiring tumor-APCs with >85% purity, it is recommended to perform MACS-enrichment 1–2 days before FACS. This will enrich total reprogrammed cells 10-fold and yield an average of 2 × 106 reprogrammed cells at day 9 per 1 × 106 cancer cells seeded at day -1 (Figure 1), reducing time for FACS purification.At day 9 of reprogramming, detach cells as described in step B6a.Resuspend and dissociate cells gently by pipetting up and down 10 times with 3 mL of cold MACS buffer per pellet from 100 mm tissue culture plate. Count cells using a hemocytometer and calculate total cell number.Note: Adjust starting cell numbers depending on reprogramming efficiency and final application. For cancer cells that have low reprogramming efficiency (<10% of double-positive cells for CD45+ MHC-II+), we recommend starting with a minimum of 1 × 107 cancer cells. To perform quality control by flow cytometric analysis after the procedure is completed, it is recommended that 0.1–0.",
    "3 mL of cell suspension (pre-MACS) is stored on ice in a round-bottom tube.Note: If a high level of cell debris and cell death is noticed, consider using a dead cell or debris removal kit in advance, as dying cells can bind unspecifically to antibodies and result in poor enrichment yields (see Table 6, Troubleshooting). Centrifuge cell suspension from step 2 at 350× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Note: The volumes included in the next steps are for 107 cells. Adjust volumes according to the total cell number obtained in step C2. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend 107 cells in 0.1 mL of MACS buffer.Pipette 2 µL of rat serum per 107 total cells of rat serum into the cell suspension.(Critical) Place cells on ice and incubate for 15 min.Note: It is crucial that incubation steps are always performed on ice to avoid capping of antibodies on the cell surface and non-specific cell labeling. Pipette 0.125 µg of biotin-labeled anti-CD45 and 0.06 µg of biotin-labeled anti-MHC-II per 107 total cells. Resuspend cells by lightly vortexing the sample.Note: the volume of antibodies may require further optimization (see Table 6, Troubleshooting). If the cell line of choice does not express a marker abundantly (CD45 or MHC-II), it is possible to perform MACS with one antibody only targeting the most expressed marker. Place cell suspension on ice and incubate for 5 min. See General note 1 for an alternative to biotin beads.Wash cells with 2 mL per 107 total cells of cold MACS buffer followed by centrifugation at 350× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Aspirate supernatant and resuspend cells in 80 µL of cold MACS buffer per 107 total cells.Add 20 µL of anti-biotin microbeads per 107 total cells and resuspend cell suspension by lightly vortexing the sample.",
    "Place cells on ice and incubate for 15 min.In the meantime, prepare magnetic MACS MultiStand and columns. Place the MACS MultiStand inside the laminar flow hood and attach magnetic MidiMACS separators.Insert LS MACS columns into MidiMACS separators.Equilibrate columns by washing with 3 mL of cold MACS buffer. Discard the liquid and place a 50 mL centrifuge tube under the column.After incubation, wash cells by adding 2 mL of MACS buffer per 107 total cells followed by centrifugation at 350× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Aspirate supernatant and resuspend cells in 1 mL per 107 total cells.(Critical) For optimal enrichment, it is crucial to obtain a single-cell suspension at this step. Pipette up and down to remove cell clumps before introducing magnetic-labeled cells in columns. If necessary, filter cells through a 50 mm nylon mesh.Note: When working with columns, always wait until the column reservoir is empty before proceeding to the next step. (Critical) Transfer 0.5 mL of cell suspension onto the column. It is recommended to only apply 0.5–1 mL of filtered magnetic-labeled, single-cell suspension per column to avoid column clogging.Wash column with 3 mL of MACS buffer. Repeat twice.In this step, cells in flowthrough are untransduced and unsuccessfully reprogrammed cancer cells. It is recommended that 0.1–0.2 mL of flowthrough [post-MACS negative fraction, (-)] is saved for evaluation by flow cytometry after the protocol is completed. Place remaining cells on ice (see Table 6, Troubleshooting).Remove column from the separator and place it on top of a 15 mL centrifuge tube. Wait for 1 min.Pipette 5 mL of MACS buffer into the column reservoir and immediately but carefully plunge the liquid out of the column (see Table 6, Troubleshooting). In this step, the eluted cell suspension contains partial and complete reprogrammed tumor-APCs labeled by CD45 or MHC-II antibodies.",
    "Centrifuge at 350× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Resuspend cell pellet in 5 mL of media. Count cells using a hemocytometer.(Critical) Save 0.1–0.2 mL of the cell suspension in step C23 [post-MACS positive fraction, (+)] for flow cytometric analysis.Prepare enough round-bottom polystyrene tubes for the following samples: pre-MACS, post-MACS(-), post-MACS(+), unstained, viability stain (DAPI or fixable viability dye), and SC and FMO controls. Unstained, viability stain, SC, and FMO controls should be run with pre-MACS cell suspension saved in step 3 of this procedure. For example, for full quality control assessment, pre-MACS, post-MACS(-), and post-MACS(+) should be stained with fluorescently labeled anti-CD45 and anti-MHC-II and viability stain before flow cytometry evaluation (see Data analysis). Optionally, anti-MHC-I can also be used as a marker. See Table 2 for an example of number of tubes and specific contents for each before flow cytometric analysis.Table 2.

    "After quality control of the enriched tumor-APCs population, post-MACS positive fraction should contain >70% of partial and complete reprogrammed cells. Total number of cells expected after MACS enrichment is 2 × 105–6 × 106 cells per 106 cells seeded.Resuspended cells are now ready for downstream application in functional antigen presentation assays, killing assays by activated CD8+ T cells, and in vivo intratumoral injections.Note: Tumor-APCs exit the cell cycle during the reprogramming process and cannot expand as the original cancer cell (Zimmermannova et al., 2023). We did not test whether tumor-APCs can be freeze-thawed before functional assays. We recommend using freshly reprogrammed tumor-APCs for further applications. Evaluate exogenous antigen presentation to Naïve murine CD4+ T cells This part of the protocol is performed using reprogrammed murine B16 melanoma cells as tumor-APCs. eGFP-transduced cancer cells and BM-DCs should be included as negative and positive controls, respectively. See General note 2 for BM-DCs preparation and freezing before experimental setup. A minimum of 3.3 × 105 BM-DCs are necessary. See General note 3 for alternative APCs to BM-DCs.One day before MACS procedure, thaw one vial of BM-DCs (containing 3 × 106 cells) by gently resuspending the frozen cells in 10 mL of pre-warmed complete RPMI for BM-DCs (see Recipe 3).Transfer BM-DCs cell suspension to a 15 mL conical tube. Centrifuge at 350× g for 5 min at room temperature to remove freezing solution.Aspirate supernatant and resuspend BM-DCs in 10 mL of new RPMI for BM-DCs. Plate cell suspension in a non-tissue-culture-treated Petri dish. Incubate cells overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2.After MACS enrichment of tumor-APCs, count enriched cells and prepare a microcentrifuge tube with 1 × 106 resuspended tumor-APCs.Note: 1 × 106 tumor-APCs is ideal to account for pipetting errors.",
    "The minimum number of tumor-APCs that can be used for this protocol is 3 × 105. Centrifuge tumor-APCs at 350× g for 5 min at room temperature.

    "Incubate all 96-well plates at 37 °C, 5% CO2 overnight (12–16 h). Observe cells the day after. All cells should be gathered at the center of the well.On the day after seeding APCs for antigen presentation assays, start by preparing sterile forceps, tweezers, a pair of scissors, and 20 mL of cold MACS buffer. This will be used for spleen isolation.Euthanize OT-II mice according to protocols approved by local ethical committees and the regulations of the animal facility where the procedure is being conducted. For this protocol, mice were sacrificed in a CO2 chamber followed by cervical translocation.Note: To calculate the number of mice needed, estimate how many Naïve T cells are necessary for the whole assay, considering that the number seeded per well is 1 × 105 cells. The number of isolated Naïve CD4+ T cells is expected to be between 1.5 × 106 and 3 × 106 cells per spleen. For the setup exemplified in this protocol, a total of 7 × 106 Naïve T cells will be needed. Place mice on a surface where they can lie on the left side facing upwards (see Data analysis).Spray the torso with 70% ethanol to reduce the chance of contamination.Cut the skin and peritoneum right below the thorax and slightly off center to the left of the mouse’s body to reveal the spleen (see Data analysis).Note: If the spleen looks enlarged (splenomegaly) or black, discard the carcass and the spleen. Pull out and hold the spleen with the help of tweezers with fine tips and cut the connective tissue and fat attached to the spleen.Note: Removing connective tissue and fat as much as possible at this stage will facilitate Naïve T-cell isolation by avoiding cell clumping. Remove the spleen and store it in cold MACS buffer prepared in step D15.",
    "Repeat for the number of mice sacrificed.Discard the carcasses according to local animal facility’s procedures and continue the protocol under sterile conditions.Place a 45 mm cell strainer on top of a 50 mL centrifuge tube.Place a 45 mm cell trainer inside a Petri dish. Pipette 3 mL of cold MACS buffer to prepare the filter.Using forceps or a pipette, place one spleen inside the cell strainer. With the help of a 5 mL syringe pestle, crush the spleen against the cell strainer mesh.Once most of the spleen is crushed, remove filter from plate. With a 10 mL serological pipette, pipette 5 mL of MACS buffer into the plate and wash the plate before transferring the cell suspension through the cell strainer from step D23. Serial filtration will avoid cell clumping with connective tissue and fat in later stages.Repeat steps D24–D26 for every spleen.Note: The filter from step D23 and the plate from step D24 can be reused for up to four spleens. Substitute filter in step 24 for every new spleen that needs to be crushed. The syringe pestle can be reused for all spleens. If needed, use several centrifuge tubes to collect the samples. When splenocytes collection is finished, centrifuge cell suspension at 350× g for 5 min at room temperature.Meanwhile, prepare red blood cell lysis solution. Pipette 0.1 mL of BD Pharm Lyse solution for every 0.9 mL of sterile room temperature Milli-Q water. Keep this solution in the dark. Use 1 mL of this solution per spleen, i.e., for 15 spleens, prepare 15 mL of BD Pharm Lyse solution as described.Note: Alternatively, red blood cells can be lysed using ammonium chloride solution. Aspirate supernatant of splenocytes solution.",
    "Resuspend solution in the appropriate volume of red blood cell lysis solution prepared in step D29 (1 mL per spleen) and incubate splenocytes for 8 min at room temperature in the dark.Stop the reaction by adding 50 mL of cold MACS buffer. If you notice aggregates floating, filter through a 45 mm mesh.Note: It is important that these aggregates are removed at this step to avoid loss of Naïve T cells in clumps. Centrifuge filtered cell suspension at 350× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend cells in 10–30 mL of cold MACS buffer. Count splenocytes using a hemocytometer.Note: If splenocytes were separated into different centrifuge tubes, they can be combined at this point of the procedure. Resuspend all the pellets and combine them in a single cell suspension together in one tube. The cell suspension should look dense and cloudy. Dilute the sample before counting. Centrifuge cell suspension at 350× g for 5 min at 4 °C. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 40 µL of MACS buffer per 1 × 107 total cells.Proceed by following manufacturer’s protocol for Naïve CD4+ T-cell isolation (mouse Miltenyi kit). Naïve cells are unlabeled by the kit and are found in the negative fraction.After isolating Naïve CD4+ T cells, count the number of cells using a hemocytometer.Note: If the number of Naïve CD4+ T cells is higher than 5 × 106 per spleen, it is recommended to repeat the Naïve CD4+ T-cell isolation kit protocol to avoid contamination with activated CD4+ T cells and other cell lineages. For each well containing APCs, prepare 1 × 105 T cells labeled with CellTrace Violet (CTV) as follows:Transfer the volume of cell suspension necessary to contain 5.",
    "5 × 106 Naïve CD4+ T cells for 48 assay wells in addition to five more wells for control staining (see step D47 for flow cytometric analysis). Keep the leftover Naïve CD4+ T cells on ice for later use. Centrifuge cell suspension at 350× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Prepare CTV according to manufacturer’s protocol by resuspending the powder in 20 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (provided in the kit).Aspirate supernatant and resuspend cells in 5.5 mL of cold PBS with no additives for a final density of 1 × 106 cells/mL. Pipette 5.5 µL of CTV reagent into the cell suspension (1 µL per 1 × 106 T cells).Incubate T cells in a water bath at 37 °C for 20 min.After incubation, add five times the initial staining volume of MACS buffer to block staining and incubate for 5 min in the water bath.Centrifuge cells at 350× g for 5 min at 4 °C and aspirate supernatant. Resuspend T cells in RPMI for BM-DCs for a final cell density of 1 × 106 cells/mL.Prepare the different conditions of T cells as follows:Prepare 1.2 × 106 Naïve T cells in RPMI for BM-DCs, corresponding to 1.2 mL from the cell suspension prepared in step D37f, and dispense 0.1 mL (dispensing 1 × 105 T cells per well) on top of the wells for the following conditions: Tumor-APCs NA, eGFP-transduced cancer cells NA, and BM-DCs NA.Prepare 1.2 × 106 Naïve T cells in RPMI for BM-DCs, corresponding to 1.2 mL from the cell suspension prepared in step D37f, add 10 mg/mL poly(I:C), and dispense 0.1 mL (dispensing 1 × 105 T cells per well) on top of the wells for the following conditions: Tumor-APCs NA poly(I:C), eGFP-transduced cancer cells NA poly(I:C), and BM-DCs NA poly(I:C).Prepare 1.",
    "9 × 106 Naïve T cells in RPMI for BM-DCs, corresponding to 1.9 mL from the cell suspension prepared in step D37f, add 10 mg/mL OVA 323–339, and dispense 0.1 mL (dispensing 1 × 105 T cells per well) on top of the wells for the following conditions: Tumor-APCs OVA, eGFP-transduced cancer cells OVA, and BM-DCs OVA. Include five wells of the extra BM-DCs OVA condition seeded on the day prior (for example, on top of wells E1–E5).Prepare 1.2 × 106 Naïve T cells in RPMI for BM-DCs, corresponding to 1.2 mL from the cell suspension prepared in step D37f, add 10 mg/mL OVA 323–339 and 10 mg/mL poly(I:C), and dispense 0.1 mL (dispensing 1 × 105 T cells per well) on top of the wells for the following conditions: Tumor-APCs OVA poly(I:C), eGFP-transduced cancer cells OVA poly(I:C), and BM-DCs OVA poly(I:C).Note: B16 cancer cells do not express MHC-II before reprogramming (see Data analysis). Therefore, it is not needed to wash away the peptide from supernatant in 96-well plates and it is recommended to keep the peptides until the end of co-culture. However, if the cell line of choice expresses MHC-II before reprogramming, it is recommended to centrifuge the 96-well plates at 350× g for 5 min at room temperature, before plating Naïve T cells on top of the APCs. Remove supernatant by flipping the plate downwards in a fast movement, wash the wells with fresh RPMI media, centrifuge for 5 min at room temperature, and remove media again before proceeding with step D38. For the leftover extra wells for BM-DCs OVA, prepare 8 × 105 unlabeled Naïve CD4+ T cells from step D37a by resuspending the cells in 0.8 mL of RPMI for BM-DCs and adding 10 mg/mL of OVA 323–339.Pipette 0.",
    "1 mL of unlabeled T-cell resuspension on top of each of the remaining six wells (for example, wells E6–E11), dispensing 1 × 105 T cells per well. These samples will be used for flow cytometric analysis (see step D47).Incubate plates with co-cultures at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for four full days. Analysis is done at day 5.Antigen presentation is evaluated by OT-II CD4+ T cells proliferation on a flow cytometer. Prepare antibody staining solution by mixing 0.5 µL of rat serum, 0.5 µL of antibody anti-CD4 PE-Cyanine7, anti-TCRbeta allophycocyanin, and anti-CD44 allophycocyanin-Cyanine7 per 0.1 mL of MACS buffer per sample.Add to the antibody staining solution fixable viability dye eFluor 520 (FVD520) at a 1:100 dilution (1 µL per 0.1 mL per sample)Centrifuge 96-well U-shaped bottom plates with T cell tumor-APCs, eGFP-transduced cancer cells, or BM-DCs co-cultures at 350× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Flip the plate in a fast movement to remove media.Add 0.1 mL of antibody-viability dye staining solution per well.Separately, prepare staining controls as follows (see Table 5):Table 5.

    "Single color staining for CD4, CD44, TCR, and FVD and FMO CTV are done using unlabeled T cells from BM-DCs OVA condition.Single color staining for CTV and FMO CD4, CD44, TCR, and FVD are done using CTV-labeled T cells from BM-DCs OVA condition.Reserve the supernatant of one well to use as unstained control.Incubate plates for 30 min at 4 °C, protected from light.Add 0.1 mL of cold MACS buffer to each well and centrifuge plates at 350× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Flip the plates to remove staining solution and resuspend the cell pellets in the 96-well plates in 100 µL of cold MACS buffer before going to a flow cytometer.Flow cytometry analysis can be done directly from the 96-well plate using a high-throughput screening device attached to the flow cytometer. Alternatively, pipette each sample to a polystyrene tube prior to acquisition.OT-II proliferation is measured by gating within live, single CD4+ TCR+ CD44+ CTVlow population of CD4+ T cells, with T-cell division assessed by loss of CTV staining overtime (see Data analysis).Note: This protocol can also be used for assessing antigen presentation through MHC-I to Naïve CD8+ T cells (Zimmermannova et al., 2023). Instead of using OVA 323–339, incubate APCs with OVA 257-264 (SIINFEKL) or OVA protein. Wash peptide before co-culture with Naïve T cells, as some cells naturally express MHC-I that leads to unspecific binding. Instead of using OT-II mouse strain, collect spleens from OT-I mouse strain (C57BL/6-Tg(TcraTcrb)1100Mjb/J) as described in steps D16–35, and isolate Naïve CD8+ T cells using appropriate kits. Co-culture with Naïve CD8+ T cells should be shortened to three days instead of four. In this scenario, anti-CD4 is substituted for anti-CD8 in the same color, PE-Cyanine7.",
    "Human tumor-APCs can also be used for antigen presentation assays by pulsing tumor-APCs with peptides derived from cytomegalovirus (CMV) and melanoma-associated antigen recognized by T cells (MART-1), followed by co-culture with CD8+ T cells isolated from CMV+/MART-1+ donors. Flow cytometric analysis is done at day 8 of co-culture and read-out is obtained from tetramer staining against CMV or MART1 and intracellular staining for IFN-γ and TNF-α to assess activation (Zimmermannova et al., 2023). In addition to antigen presentation assays, tumor-APCs can be employed in killing assays, by co-culturing with activated T cells followed by assessing T cell–mediated cytolysis by flow cytometry or by electric impedance with the xCELLigence Real-time Cell Analysis Assay (Zimmermannova et al., 2023). Finally, tumor-APCs can be used for therapeutic intratumoral vaccination protocols. In all applications described here, tumor-APCs derived from cancer cell lines and primary samples can be used."
