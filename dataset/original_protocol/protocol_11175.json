    "The method described here has been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the MD Anderson Cancer Center and complies with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The schematic workflow, with all steps included, is presented as Figure 1.\n1. Cell preparation\nNOTE: The MDA-IBC3 (ER-/PR-/HER2+) cell line, generated in Dr. Woodward's lab24, was stably transduced with a luciferase-green fluorescent protein (Luc-GFP) plasmid.\nCulture transduced cells in Ham's F-12 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 µg/mL hydrocortisone, 5 µg/mL insulin, and 1% antibiotic-antimitotic.\nPlate MDA-IBC3-Luc-GFP cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a T-75 flask until confluent. Change media every 3 days before cells are confluent enough to passage.\nHarvest cells by removing media, washing each flask with 10 mL of 1x Dulbecco's (i.e., calcium- and magnesium-free) phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), and adding 2 mL of 0.25% trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Incubate for 3-5 min at 37 °C until cells detach.\nAdd 5 mL of complete media to the flask to collect the cells and transfer the entire contents to a 15 mL centrifuge tube (optimized to 50 mL centrifuge tube depending on the total number of cells needed). Centrifuge at 290 x g for 5 min to pellet cells.\n\tNOTE: Complete media is Ham's F-12 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 µg/mL hydrocortisone, 5 µg/mL insulin, and 1% antibiotic-antimitotic.\nDiscard the supernatant. Then wash the cells with 10 mL of 1x DPBS. Centrifuge at 290 x g for 5 min to pellet the cells and discard the supernatant carefully. Resuspend the cells with 1 mL of fresh 1x DPBS and mix well by pipetting up and down.\nTo make single-cell suspensions, filter cells through 40 µm sterile cell strainers.",
    "Calculate cell density by using an automated cell counter.\n\tNOTE: To reduce errors in counting, create different cell dilutions and count them separately, and calculate the average value to determine the concentration of cells (number of cells/mL).\n\t\nCollect 2 µL of cell suspension + 8 µL of 1x DPBS to make a 1:5 dilution sample.\nCollect 1 µL of cell suspension + 9 µL of 1x DPBS to make a 1:10 dilution sample.\nAdd 10 µL of 0.4% trypan blue stain. Mix the sample mixture well by pipetting it up and down a few times.\nGently pipette 10 µL of the sample into the half-moon-shaped sample loading area of the counting chamber slides. Make sure there are no bubbles inside; wait for 30 s to allow the cells to settle in the chamber before counting.\nDilute the cells with 1x DPBS to a density of 5 x 105 or 1 x 106 cells per 100 µL. Transfer cell suspension into 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tubes for tail-vein injection. Place cells on ice until injection to maintain viability.\n2. Tail vein injection\nUse 4- to 6-week-old female athymic SCID/Beige mice.\nPrepare a 30 G syringe to draw 100 µL of cell suspension. Remove all air bubbles.\nPlace mouse in a rodent restrainer (diameter about 1 inch) to facilitate tail-vein injection and prevent injuries from movement during the injection process.\nUse alcohol cotton pads (made with 70% ethanol) to gently wipe the mouse's tail 3-4 times and hold for 5-10 s to make the tail vein more clearly visible.\nInsert the syringe into the tail of the mouse at an angle of 15-30°. Slowly push the cell suspension into the tail vein.\nRemove the syringe gently and use the cotton pad to hold the tail for few seconds to help stop any bleeding.",
    "Return the mice to their cages and check them 2-4 h after injection to ensure that no adverse effects occur.\n3. Evaluation of brain metastasis burden\nPrepare diluted D-luciferin solution.\n\t​NOTE: Stock concentration is 47.6 mM (15.15 mg/mL), and the concentration for use is 1.515 mg/mL.\n\t\nAdd 5 mL of 1x DPBS to the D-luciferin bottle.\nPlace 2.5 mL of the solution into each of two 50 mL conical tubes.\nAdd another 5 mL of 1x DPBS to the D-luciferin bottle again to rinse it. Put 2.5 mL into each 50 mL conical tube.\nPlace another 5 mL of 1x DPBS into the bottle and rinse it again.Repeat the rinsing process twice.\nAdd 1x DPBS to each 50 mL tube to a total of 66 mL (about 33 mL per tube). There should be about 33 mL of the solution in each tube.\nMix the tubes well and then combine both into a sterile filtration unit (150 mL PES filter 0.45 µm).\nFilter the solution and then aliquot the filtered solution into sterile amber 1.7 mL microtubes.\nDetecting brain metastases by luciferase imaging.\n\t\nThaw D-luciferin by keeping on ice, and vortex before injection into the mice.\nClean the area of injection with alcohol cotton pads and inject 100 µL of D-luciferin per mouse intraperitoneally by using a 0.5 mL insulin syringe, one syringe for each cage.\nAfter 10 min, anesthetize the mice with isoflurane (2% O2- 2.5% isoflurane) for 5 min using the veterinary vaporizer connected to the small animal induction chamber.\nTurn on the in vivo imaging system. While the mice from the first cage are under anesthesia, inject the D-luciferin into the mice in the next cage.",
    "Put mice into the in vivo imaging system machine and obtain ventral and dorsal images. Select an exposure time of 2 min, and in the field view choose option E (whole body). Press Acquire. Next, save the image (Figure 2).\n\t\t​NOTE: If the image shows saturation of luminescence, reduce the exposure time.\nDetecting brain metastases by GFP imaging.\n\t\nBrain tissue preparation.\n\t\t\nAbout 8-10 weeks post injection of cells or when the mice are moribund due to brain metastasis burden, euthanize the mice by inhalation of an isoflurane overdose followed by cervical dislocation, in accordance with protocols approved by the IACUC.\nAfter euthanasia with isoflurane followed by cervical dislocation, spray the mice with a 70% ethanol solution and remove the fur from the head area and ears with scissors. Next, make a cut in the cervical area of the neck (being careful to not decapitate the mouse). Cut the skull and pull it out. Next, carefully remove the brain.\nPlace the collected brains into tissue cassettes.\nTransfer the cassettes to a container with cold 1x DPBS.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: Brain samples should not be kept in 1x DPBS for more than 1 h. If several brain samples are to be collected at the same time, euthanize only a few mice at a time (10 per round).\nStereomicroscopic imaging.\n\t\t\nTransfer the whole brain onto a 100 cm tissue dish lid.\nTurn on the stereomicroscope and the UV light, at position 3 with lens 0.5x, to allow visualization of the whole brain as shown in Figure 3A (red square).\nPress Live view (Figure 3A, green square).\nFocus the view while the brain is in the ventral position.",
    "Select GFP (if cells are GFP-labeled) or TXRED (if cells are RFP-labeled) (Figure 3A, yellow square) in the software, select the proper filter on the microscope, and take a picture.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: Keep the SOLA light source setting at about 30%; if the GFP is too bright, reduce until the proper signal is observed.\nWithout moving the sample, turn on the bright light and select BF (Figure 3A, yellow square). Take a picture.\nRepeat the previous steps with the brain in the dorsal position.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: Depending on the size, the same GFP positive brain metastasis lesion can appear in both ventral and dorsal positions. In such a case, avoid duplicate quantification of the same lesion. Save the images with a TIFF extension (which keeps all the information in the picture file).\nSave the images with a TIFF extension (which keeps all the information in the picture file).\nRepeat steps for all samples.\nConvert the TIFF images into JPEG so that the files can be opened with any computer that does not have the associated software installed (File | Import/Export | convert files).\nTo merge the fluorescent image with the bright field image, open both images and go to File | Merge channels. Select the proper components, green for GFP and brightfield for BF, and press Ok. Save the merged image.\nTo quantify brain tumor area, use the fluorescent image. Select Measure | Manual Measurement | Area. Select automatic selection (Figure 3B, green square), and move the arrow to the GFP-positive area and click to automatically create a selection. Click again to confirm the selection and then all measurements will show (Figure 3B, red square). If more than one GFP-positive area is present, repeat the procedure.\nAfter brain images are obtained, proceed to routine tissue fixation protocols using 10% neutral buffered formalin.",
    "Once the brains are fixed, proceed to standard histological sectioning followed by hematoxylin and eosin staining to confirm the presence of brain metastasis and immunohistochemical staining to detect selected markers.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Immunocytochemistry was performed at the Pathology Core Laboratory at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center that has standardized protocol for immunohistochemical staining of known markers.\nSubscription Required.
