    "Larvae collection and insecticide exposure Using the micropipette, load a 48-well Nunc plate with 200 µL of 5% sucrose solution per well.Using a pair of forceps, gently transfer 25 early third-instar larvae per well (Figure 1A, B).For the insecticide exposure, add 50 µL of the 5× spinosad stock solution (see Recipes) to each well containing larvae to be exposed and give the plate a gentle swirl. For unexposed controls, add 50 µL of the 5× DMSO stock solution instead (see Recipes). The final concentration of insecticide used here is 2.5 ppm.Keep the plate at 25°C and covered with aluminum foil to protect it from light for 2 h (or desirable number of hours), until exposure is over.Once exposure time is over, using a pair of forceps gently transfer larvae to a new well containing 250 µL of 1× PBS.Tissue dissection and staining Transfer larvae from the PBS-containing well to a microscopy slide containing a drop of cold (4°C) Schneider's medium 1×.Under the stereo microscope, begin the dissection. Using two pairs of forceps, hold the larval body at the midpoint (Figure 1C) and pull the anterior and posterior regions apart (Figure 1D).Using a pair of forceps, gently transfer the anterior body section (Figure 1E) to a microtube containing 495 µL of cold (4°C) 1× PBS.Add 5 µL of LysoTracker Red working stock solution (see Recipes) to the microtube. Final LysoTracker concentration of 1:10,000 (Figure 1F).Wrap the microtube in aluminum foil to protect it from light and keep it at slow agitation on a nutator mixer for 7 min (Figure 1G).Using a micropipette, slowly and completely remove the staining solution without touching the sample (Figure 1H).",
    "Gently add 500 µL of 1× cold (4°C) PBS back into the microtube (Figure H) and place it back on the nutator mixer for 5 min (Figure I).Under the stereo microscope, add a drop of cold (4°C) Schneider's medium 1× to a new microscopy slide. Using a pair of forceps, gently transfer the stained sample from the microtube onto the slide (Figure 1J).Conclude the dissection by holding the anterior body section sideways with two pairs of forceps and gently pull them apart from each other to tear the cuticle. Once the brain is located, use a pair of forceps to clear the surrounding tissues (Figure 1K).Mounting slides for fluorescence microscopy Add a small drop of Vectashield on top of the brain, only enough to cover it. Using a pair of forceps, if necessary, adjust sample orientation.Cut two small pieces of double-sided tape and place them flanking the sample in Vectashield.Place the coverslip on the top, aligning its border with the double-sided tape (Figure 1L).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4599/bioprotoc-13-02-4599-g001.jpgFigure 1.

For partial dissection start by holding down a larva at midpoint. D. Pull anterior and posterior body regions apart. E. Larva anterior body region. F. Transfer the anterior body region to a microtube containing cold 1× PBS and add LysoTracker Red working stock solution to it. G. Wrap the microtube in aluminum foil and keep it at slow agitation on a nutator mixer for 7 min. H. Perform one washing step by replacing the solution in the microtube with cold 1× PBS. I. Return the microtube wrapped in foil to the nutator mixer at low agitation for 5 min. J.",
    "Transfer the partially dissected sample to a slide containing a drop of cold Schneider’s medium. K. Under the microscope, conclude dissection, and isolate the brain from other tissues. L. Mount the slide for microscopy using double-sided tape, Vectashield, and a cover slip and proceed to image acquisition immediately.Imaging Proceed to image acquisition with a confocal fluorescence microscope immediately. Given that no fixative solution is used here, time from partial dissection to acquisition of last image should be kept within 30 min to avoid tissue degradation.In some cases, LysoTracker staining may not penetrate the more central parts of the brain or may aggregate at the brain’s surface. For that reason, to maintain consistency across samples, it is desirable to acquire images from a zone that excludes the brain’s surface and avoids central areas (Figure 2A).To ensure consistency and accuracy in the measurements, set optimal values of laser power and gain with a control sample and maintain the same settings across all samples.Select the same zones for imaging across all samples. Here, to maintain consistency, images were only acquired from the optic lobes.Once the zone is localized, acquire red signal (excitation/emission 577/590 nm) using a 40× objective (NA 1.1). It is important to find consistency in the signal observed within control samples, as well as exposed samples. Lack of consistency may indicate sample degradation or inappropriate staining.Acquire at least 20 images across the z-stack for every sample with 1 µm distance between them and avoid imaging the sample’s top and bottom. Image at least seven brain samples per group/treatment condition."
