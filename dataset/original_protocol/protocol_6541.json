    "PEG-Ca2+ transfection of rice egg cells with plasmid DNAAn outline of procedures for PEG-Ca2+ transfection of rice egg cells with plasmid DNA is presented in Figure 2A.As shown in Figures 2C and 2D, prepare 0.5-1 µl droplets of mannitol solution, MMG solution, MMG solution containing plasmid DNA (MMG-DNA, 80-320 ng/µl) and PEG-Ca2+ solution (Figures 2C and 2D).Notes:Our study suggested that a MMG-DNA solution containing a higher plasmid concentration (ca. 270-320 ng/µl) generally results in efficient transient expression (Koiso et al., 2017).For preparation of the MMG solution and PEG-Ca2+ solution, use mannitol solution adjusted to 370 mosmol/kg H2O (330 mM) and 450 mosmol/kg H2O (385 mM) by osmometer for rice egg cells and zygotes, respectively.If the concentration of prepared plasmid DNA sample is low, and the fluid volume of plasmid DNA exceeds that of the MMG solution when you prepare the MMG-DNA solution (80-320 ng/µl), using 2x the MMG solution (double concentration) is recommended.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200713/20200713082147_9652.jpgFigure 2.

Rice egg cell in the merged droplet of MMG-DNA and PEG-Ca2+ solution (left panel) or in mannitol solution (right panel). Egg cell shrank upon PEG-Ca2+ treatment, and the size of the egg cell recovered in mannitol solution after the treatment. In A and B, the pink, green and orange circles indicate the egg, sperm and zygotic nuclei, respectively. The yellow lightning bolt and gray rings in A and B indicate the point of electrofusion and plasmid DNAs, respectively. In D, the arrowheads indicate the procedures for transferring cells into each droplet during PEG-Ca2+ transfection. The curved arrows above the on MMG + Macromolecules and PEG droplets indicate the process of merging and mixing the two droplets in Step A6. Scale bars = 1 cm in C and 20 µm in E.Transfer approximately three to six egg cells isolated from rice flowers into a 0.5-1 µl droplet of mannitol solution (370 mosmol/kg H2O) overlaid with mineral oil on a coverslip using a glass capillary (Figure 2D).Wash the cells twice by transferring them into a MMG solution droplet on a coverslip.Note: Because the cells tend to attach to the surface of the coverslip in the MMG solution droplet, the manipulation of sucking and releasing cells in the MMG solution droplet should be performed with the tip of the glass capillary positioned slightly above the bottom of the coverslip. Transfer the cells into a droplet of MMG-DNA (Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1.",
    "Rinse rice egg cells with MMG solution by transferring the cells into a MMG droplet, and subsequently transferring the cells into a droplet of MMG-DNA Merge the MMG-DNA droplet, where the cells are transferred, with a droplet of PEG-Ca2+ solution using a glass capillary (Figure 2D; Video 2). Then immediately and gently mix the merged droplet using a glass capillary for approximately 1 min.Note: Although the cells often float in the mixed solution when the MMG-DNA droplet is merged with PEG-Ca2+ solution, these cells gradually sink in the solution during incubation.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Mixing of the MMG-DNA droplet, where rice egg cells are held, with a droplet of PEG-Ca2+ solution using a glass capillary Incubate for 5 min at room temperature. Herein, cell shrinkage can be observed (Figure 2E).After incubation, replace the mixed solution containing the MMG-DNA and PEG-Ca2+ solution with the mannitol solution by adding the mannitol solution to the merged droplet and gently mix the droplet using a glass capillary.Suck out approximately half the volume of the mixed solution using a glass capillary (Video 3).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 3. Replacement of the mixed MMG-DNA and PEG-Ca2+ solution with mannitol solution. Mannitol solution is added to a droplet of the MMG-DNA and PEG-Ca2+-mixed solution, and then the droplet is gently mixed using a glass capillary. Thereafter, approximately half of the volume of the solution is removed from the droplet.Repeat Steps A9 and A10 five to six times to reduce the concentration of MMG and PEG-Ca2+ in the droplet where PEG-Ca2+ treated cells exist. During this process, the shrunken cell recovers its initial round shape (Figure 2E).Transfer the treated cells to fresh mannitol solution (Figure 2D).Wash the cells three to four times by transferring them into droplets of fresh mannitol solution (450 mosmol/kg H2O) using a glass capillary.",
    "Transfer the cells into a droplet of zygote culture medium with several aggregates of the feeder cells (Figure 3A, Nakajima et al., 2010) or into zygote culture medium in a Millicell insert with a drop (approximately 50 µl) of several aggregates of feeder cells (Figure 3B).Note: Culture of the treated egg cells in the droplet is well suited for short-term observation and analysis (approximately 1-2 days). For long-term culture (more than 2-3 days), a millicell culture is recommended (see Procedure B). Culture the egg cells at 26 °C in the dark without shaking for an appropriate period and conduct analyses of the cells.Note: In our study, the transfected egg cells cultured in droplets expressed GFP and DsRed2 fluorescent signals, which are derived from plasmid DNAs transfected into the cells, at approximately 1 day after transfection. Further, when we transfected the rice egg cells with plasmid DNA harboring OsASGR-BBML1, the treated cells cultured in the millicell initiated nuclear/cell division around 2 days after transfection (Koiso et al., 2017, Rahman et al., 2019).PEG-Ca2+ transfection of rice zygotes with plasmid DNAAn outline of procedures for PEG-Ca2+ transfection of rice zygotes with plasmid DNA is presented in Figure 2B.For PEG-Ca2+ transfection, use IVF-produced rice zygotes within 1 h after electrofusion.Note: As cell wall formation around the plasma membrane of zygotes generally starts after gamete fusion, the early zygotes in which cell walls are thought to be immature should be used for PEG-Ca2+ transfection. The PEG-Ca2+ transfection of rice zygotes is performed as Steps A2-A11, except that the mannitol solution is adjusted to 450 mosmol/kg H2O instead of 370 mosmol/kg H2O.For culture of PEG-Ca2+ transfected zygotes in a Millicell insert, place 0.2 ml zygote culture medium in a Millicell-CM insert and put it into a 3.",
    "5 cm plastic dish containing 2 ml of the medium. Add 40-60 µl of a rice suspension cell culture into the dish as feeder cells (Figure 3B).Wash the transfected zygotes three to four times by transferring them into droplets of fresh mannitol solution (450 mosmol/kg H2O) using a glass capillary.Transfer the transfected zygotes onto the membranes of a Millicell insert preprared in Step B4 (Figure 3B).Culture of PEG-Ca2+ transfected zygotesAfter overnight culture of zygotes at 26 °C in the dark without shaking, continue culture with gentle shaking (40 rpm) (Figures 3C-a and 3C-b).At 5 to 7 days after fusion, remove feeder cells by transferring the Millicell dishes containing the embryos into new 35-mm-diameter dishes filled with 2 ml of fresh zygote culture medium and continue culturing as above (Figure 3C-c).After approximately 18-20 days in culture, subculture cell colonies developed from the transfected zygotes in Millicell inserts onto a regeneration medium in plastic dishes by use of a sterilized forcep. Incubate under a 13/11 h light/dark cycle at 28 °C for approximately 15-30 days (Figure 3C-d).Transfer the calli with regenerated shoots into a rooting medium in plastic dishes and culture them under a 13/11 h light/dark cycle at 28 °C for around 15 days (Figure 3C-e).Transfer the resulting plantlets into soil and grow in environmental chambers. If needed, harvest seeds from the regenerated plants (Figure 3C-f).Note: In our study, approximately 60%-70% of the PEG-Ca2+ transfected zygotes grew and regenerated into plantlets.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200713/20200713082217_1389.jpgFigure 3.

The candidates of gRNA target sequences found by the Focas webtoolPut the selected gRNA sequences with a PAM sequence in “CasOT” of the Focas webtool for off-target searches. Select gRNA sequences that show low off-target scores.Predict the secondary structure of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) containing the selected gRNA sequences using the RNA Folding Form software, available from the mfold web server.",
    "Note: If prediction of the secondary structure of the sgRNAs indicates that a stem-loop structure will be formed through complementary binding in the target-sequence region, avoiding the selected sgRNAs is recommended, as the difference in the targeting efficiency is most likely due to the secondary structure of the guide sequence (Jensen et al., 2017). After selection of the target sequence, prepare a vector harboring a CRISPR-Cas9 expression cassette as below.Note: In our study, the tRNA-based multiplex CRISPR-Cas9 vector (pMgPoef4_129-2A-GFP; accession number LC460477) used for both single and multiplex gRNA expression was employed for genome editing. In brief, the vector harbors an O. sativa codon-optimized Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (OsCas9) sequence, fused to GFP via a self-cleaving 2A peptide under the control of the ubiquitin promoter, and the tRNA-gRNA units under a OsU3 gene promoter. The details of the vector construction are described in Toda et al. (2019). To construct the tRNA-gRNA units for single genome editing, amplify the target sequence by PCR using specific primers to obtain an artificial gene including tRNA and gRNA scaffold sequences.Note: Information on specific primers is described in Toda et al. (2019). To construct the tRNA-gRNA units for multiplex genome editing, amplify the tRNA-gRNA1-tRNA-gRNA2 sequence by PCR using specific primers to obtain an artificial gene including tRNA and gRNA scaffold sequences.Note: Information on specific primers is described in Toda et al. (2019). Insert amplified target sequences or tRNA-gRNA fragments into the BsaI site of the multiplex CRISPR-Cas9 vector using Golden Gate Cloning methods (New England Biolabs).Deliver the produced CRISPR-Cas9 vector into rice zygotes by PEG-Ca2+ transfection according to Procedure B.Culture the transfected zygotes as described in Procedure C.Genome editing in rice by direct delivery of Cas9-gRNA ribonucleoproteins into zygotesSelect target sequences on each target gene according to Steps D1-D5.",
    "Synthesize and purify sgRNA containing the target sequence using the GeneArt Precision gRNA Synthesis Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific).Premix Cas9 protein (1 µl) and in vitro transcribed sgRNA (2-3 µg) in a total volume of 1.5-2.1 µl and incubate the premix solution at room temperature for 10 min.After incubation, gently mix the solution containing the CRISPR RNPs with 10 µl of MMG solution (MMG-RNP).Perform PEG-Ca2+ transfection of rice zygotes as Procedure B except for the use of MMG-RNP instead of MMG-DNA.Culture the transfected zygotes as described in Procedure C.Validation of targeted mutagenesis in the plants regenerated from PEG-Ca2+-transfected zygotes by genomic DNA PCR and sequencing of the target sitesCut small pieces of the leaves (2-3 mm2) of rice plants regenerated from zygotes previously PEG-Ca2+-transfected with a CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid or RNP.Prepare genomic DNAs from the cut leaves using PrepMan Ultra according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Note: In our study, a cut plant leaf is put into a 40 µl solution of PrepMan Ultra and heated at 95 °C for 20 min. Thereafter, the heated sample is diluted with 100 µl sterilized water for subsequent genomic DNA PCR. Amplify PCR fragments containing the target site using PrimeSTAR GXL DNA polymerase with genomic DNAs and a primer set for each target.After genomic DNA PCR, purify the amplified PCR fragments using ExoSAP-IT Express PCR Cleanup Reagents, and determine the nucleotide sequence of the PCR fragment.Confirm targeted mutagenesis of the genome-edited plants by Parallel Editor program in GENETYX software. Sanger sequencing chromatograms at target sites of genes on genomic DNA should also be confirmed using SnapGene Viewer.",
    "When the sequencing results show heterologous target mutations, the amplified PCR fragments in Step F3 are subcloned into the pCR-Blunt vector using the Zero Blunt PCR Cloning Kit, and sequence of plasmid inserts from four or more independent clones of transformed E. coli are determined.Confirm targeted mutagenesis of genome-edited plants as described in Step F5.Note: A flow chart of the present genome editing procedures are presented in Figure 5.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200713/20200713082255_5709.jpgFigure 5.
