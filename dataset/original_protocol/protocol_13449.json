  "procedures": [
    "The protocol follows the guidelines of the Wake Forest School of Medicine Research and Ethics committee, and informed written consent was obtained following IRB approval prior to imaging. Any patient with carpal tunnel syndrome who had abnormal nerve conduction studies of the median nerve was appropriate for ultrasound imaging. Individuals with no symptoms of carpal tunnel and normal nerve conduction studies were excluded from the study. A high-end multi-purpose ultrasound machine, equipped with a 15 MHz linear array transducer (see Table of Materials) was used in the present study.\n1. Visualizing the median nerve at the distal wrist crease (DWC)\nAsk the patient to sit facing the examiner with their palms upward, fingers semi extended, resting on a pillow or flat surface, and forearms semi flexed at 90°. If the patient cannot sit upright for extended periods, place them in the supine position.\nEnsure the ultrasound machine is turned on, apply a generous amount of gel to the transducer, and position it at the DWC. Hold the probe at the base and keep it perpendicular to the nerve's long axis, maintaining the wrist in a neutral position when beginning scanning.\nBefore scanning, check the settings to ensure that there is optimum contrast between the nerve and the surrounding structures by adjusting the gain. Keep the focal point position at the level of the median nerve and the depth to a minimum to allow for better imaging of the median nerve.\n\tNOTE: Continue to adjust these settings while tracing the path of the median nerve.",
    "Begin the scan proximally and distally to find the point of maximal enlargement of the median nerve at the DWC, which approximates the carpal tunnel inlet where the median nerve lies anterior to the flexor tendons and is at the level of the pisiform bone and scaphoid (radial landmark) (Figure 1A) to obtain a cross-sectional view of the median nerve.\nContinue to scan the surrounding structures to evaluate for potential anatomical abnormalities such as bifid nerves, ganglion cysts, lipomas, etc.\n2. Evaluation of the median nerve at the DWC\nObtain a cross-sectional area (CSA) measurement at the site of maximal nerve enlargement in mm2 by using the trace tool as the preferred measuring modality. If not available, then use the elliptical measuring tool on the ultrasound machine and compare this measurement to the local reference values.\n\tNOTE: This may be more accurate than using a specific anatomical landmark to obtain a measurement14. When the transducer is angled perpendicular to the nerve instead of parallel, it minimizes the overestimation of the cross-sectional area and helps avoid anisotropy or changes in echogenicity by changing the angle of the transducer.\nCheck the measurement of the inner epineural hyperechoic rim of the median nerve to avoid over measurement of the median nerve (Figure 2A).\nAssess median nerve mobility by asking the patient to flex and extend their fingers and wrist while holding the transducer in place in the transverse view.\n\tNOTE: Mobility of the nerve is qualitatively graded based on the range of movement of the nerve in relation to the surrounding flexor tendons15. A diseased nerve will demonstrate little to no mobility.\nNote the echotexture of the nerve, as a normal nerve is hypoechoic and surrounded by echogenic connective tissue.",
    "Press the color doppler flow button of the ultrasound machine to evaluate the blood flow in the median nerve at the wrist.\n3. Visualizing the median nerve in the forearm\nContinue to center the median nerve in the ultrasound screen and slowly move the transducer proximally from the wrist to the distal 1/3 of the forearm, keeping the median nerve within sight at approximately halfway up the forearm (Figure 1B).\n\tNOTE: In this location, the median nerve takes on a more triangular appearance and lies deep to the flexor digitorum superficialis muscles and superficial to the flexor digitorum profundus muscle (Figure 2C).\nTurn the transducer 90 degrees and align with the third digit and the thenar crease to obtain a sagittal view of the median nerve (Figure 1C).  Note the appearance of any focal narrowing or enlargement (Figure 2B).\n4. Evaluation of the median nerve in the forearm\nObtain a cross-sectional area measurement at the forearm in mm2 by using the ultrasound machine's trace or elliptical measuring tool and compare this measurement to local reference values.  Ensure measurement of the inner epineural hyperechoic rim of the median nerve.\n\tNOTE: This measurement is gathered to calculate a wrist/forearm ratio which can be useful if the CSA is normal or borderline in the wrist.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63982/63982fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Visualizing the median nerve.
