    "Heme removal by methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) extractionThis protocol works best for relatively concentrated protein samples (~0.1-1 mM on a heme basis) and when the sample volume is at least 1 ml. The latter requirement enables facile separation of the organic and aqueous solution phases that are generated during the extraction procedure. The flow chart in Figure 1 describes the removal of heme from hemoproteins by methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) extraction. Purified protein is extracted with MEK, leading to phase separation of the organic, heme-containing layer and the aqueous, protein-containing layer. The aqueous layer is collected and the protein is rescued into recovery buffer.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4156/bioprotoc-11-18-4156-g001.jpgFigure 1. Methyl ethyl ketone extraction. Hemoprotein is buffer-exchanged and transferred to a separatory funnel or 50-ml conical. The sample is extracted with MEK, which forms a heme-containing (red squares) organic layer above the aqueous layer (purple) containing apo-protein (grey spheres) after a short incubation period. The aqueous layer is collected, by opening the separatory funnel or by using a pipet to transfer the lower layer from the 50-mL conical, and rescued into recovery buffer. Residual MEK is removed by buffer-exchanging the sample. The figure was created using BioRender.com.Exchange the hemoprotein solution into MEK extraction buffer and adjust the concentration to 1-10 mg/ml by either diluting the sample in MEK extraction buffer or buffer-exchanging the sample via centrifugal concentration (Amicon® Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit) or dialysis (SnakeSkinTM dialysis tubing). A practical final volume is 5-10 ml.Pre-chill 15 ml MEK per 2 L expression culture (or approximately 1 ml MEK per 2 mg protein) and a ~3-fold sample volume of recovery buffer separately on ice.Dilute 12 N HCl to a final concentration of 2 M HCl in nanopure water.Adjust the pH of the chilled hemoprotein solution to 2.25-2.45 with 2 M HCl.",
    "Monitor the change in pH using a pH meter.Combine ice-cold MEK and hemoprotein solution at a 1:1 ratio in a glass separatory funnel or 15–50 ml Falcon tube. Mix gently and thoroughly to maximize the heme extraction efficiency.Allow approximately 15 min for the resulting emulsion to fully undergo phase separation. The upper MEK layer should have a red-pink color due to the presence of solvated heme.If using a separatory funnel, collect the lower aqueous layer containing the apo-protein by careful elution. If using a Falcon tube, insert a glass Pasteur pipet to the bottom of the tube and carefully pipet the aqueous layer into a fresh tube. Additional extraction and wash steps may be required for certain samples.Transfer the aqueous protein solution to ice-cold recovery buffer at a 1:1 ratio by volume, and incubate the sample on ice for approximately 10 min to allow the protein of interest to refold.Buffer-exchange the protein by dialysis (SnakeSkinTM dialysis tubing) against fresh recovery buffer to remove the excess dissolved MEK.Concentrate and buffer-exchange the protein in its final storage/assay buffer or an appropriate buffer for additional chromatography steps.Analyze the efficacy of heme extraction as described in the Data Analysis section. Example absorbance spectra and UV/Visible HPLC chromatograms of the Staphylococcus aureus hemoprotein IsdH (iron surface determinant H, residues 326–660) extracted by MEK are shown in Figure 5.Acid-acetone precipitationThis extraction method gives the best apo-protein recovery when working with a high concentration (~1 mM on a heme basis) of protein and low volumes. This protocol is specifically designed for volumes ≤ 1.5 ml. The flow chart in Figure 2 depicts the workflow of heme extraction by acid-acetone precipitation. The hemoprotein is precipitated in cold acid-acetone and the resulting apo-protein is pelleted, washed with additional acid-acetone, lyophilized to completely remove the solvent, and re-dissolved.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4156/bioprotoc-11-18-4156-g002.jpgFigure 2.",
    "Acid-acetone precipitation. The protein of interest is incubated with cold acid-acetone to precipitate the protein. The resulting apo-protein-containing solid is pelleted, and the heme-containing supernatant is removed. The pellet is lyophilized and re-dissolved in a buffer of choice. The sample is buffer-exchanged to remove any residual acetone. Figure created using BioRender.com.Pre-chill the acid-acetone solution to -20°C and the microcentrifuge rotor to -10°C.Aliquot 100-µl fractions of purified hemoprotein into 1.5-ml FisherbrandTM Premium microcentrifuge tubes and incubate on ice. Save 15 µl holo-protein for comparison of the heme content before and after acid-acetone precipitation.Add 1 ml acid-acetone to each 100-µl aliquot of hemoprotein and incubate at -20°C for 20 min. Protein precipitate should be visible after incubation.Centrifuge the hemoprotein/acid-acetone mixture in a microcentrifuge at 21,000 × g (rcf) for 20 min to pellet the precipitated protein, and then decant or pipet off the supernatant (see Note 8).Resuspend the pellet in an additional 1 ml acid-acetone and repeat Steps B3 and B4.Air-dry the protein pellets at room temperature for 30 min.Re-dissolve the protein in 100 µl buffer of choice. If the protein does not re-dissolve into solution, proceed with Steps B8-B9. If the protein readily dissolves, proceed to Step B10.Titrate denaturing buffer into the protein pellet suspension until the precipitate is no longer visible.Dialyze the denatured apo-protein against the buffer of choice at 4°C for a minimum of 4 h using a Slide-A-LyzerTM MINI dialysis device, 3.5 K MWCO, 0.5 ml.Buffer-exchange the sample into the buffer of choice by centrifugal filtration using an Amicon® Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit or dialyze against the buffer of choice for a minimum of 4 h to remove excess acetone using a Slide-A-LyzerTM MINI dialysis device, 3.5 K MWCO, 2.0 ml.",
    "Analyze the heme content of the hemoprotein before and after extraction, as described in the Data Analysis section. Example absorbance spectra and HPLC chromatograms of IsdH extracted by acid-acetone precipitation are shown in Figure 5.On-column heme removal for histidine-tagged hemoproteinsThis protocol is highly versatile since it can be performed on purified histidine-tagged hemoproteins or integrated into the IMAC purification of crude, recombinantly expressed histidine-tagged hemoproteins in clarified Esherichia coli BL21 (DE3) lysate. In favorable cases where full protein unfolding is achieved using chaotropic reagents, this method is the easiest to perform, requiring the fewest discrete steps for heme removal with the highest yields of refolded apo-protein (Table 1). Figure 3 depicts a scheme of the steps necessary to remove heme from histidine-tagged hemoproteins concomitant with purification by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). The column is equilibrated, and hexahistidine-tagged proteins adhere to the resin, allowing proteins lacking a histidine tag to be separated from the protein of interest. The hemoprotein is denatured while still bound to the column, disrupting the secondary and tertiary structural features that form the heme-protein interface, thus freeing heme molecules to be stripped from the protein of interest by a binary mixture of chaotrope and ethanol. Finally, the apo-protein is re-folded on the column and eluted.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4156/bioprotoc-11-18-4156-g003.jpgFigure 3. Immobilized metal affinity chromatography and heme removal. Separation of His-tagged hemoproteins (red spheres) from a heterogenous protein sample (brown, yellow, and green spheres) is depicted. Upon heme (red squares) removal, a light brown solution elutes from the column, and the apo-proteins (grey spheres) are re-folded and eluted to obtain a homogenous sample. The figure was created using BioRender.com.Filter all buffers through a Thermo ScientificTM NalgeneTM Rapid-FlowTM sterile single-use vacuum filter unit with a pore size of 0.2 µm; chill to 4°C.Transfer 2.",
    "5 ml HisPurTM cobalt resin or HisPurTM nickel resin per liter cell culture to a DWK Life Sciences KimbleTM KontesTM FlexColumnTM economy column or, if the target protein concentration is known, transfer the minimum amount of resin necessary to fully bind the protein.Equilibrate the resin with a minimum of 10 column volumes (CV) equilibration buffer.Transfer the clarified cell lysate containing the protein of interest to the gravity column.Cap the column and seal it with Parafilm® M to ensure that no leaks occur. Equilibrate the resin and cell lysate at 4°C on a Clay Adams nutator mixer 1105 for a minimum of 15 min to maximize binding of the histidine-tagged hemoprotein to the resin.Bring the column back to a standing position and collect the lysate that flows through the column in a beaker or test tubes.Wash the resin with 10 CV equilibration buffer.To prepare a no-extraction negative control (holo-protein) for determination of the efficacy of heme extraction, divert a portion (1-2 ml) of the resin-bound hemoprotein and skip to Step C12.Suspend the resin in 10 CV denaturing buffer to denature the protein, and allow a 5-min incubation time to ensure re-binding of any protein dislodged through the introduction of denaturing buffer (see Note 9).Elute the denaturing buffer. This should be slightly brown in color due to the presence of solvated heme. Record the absorbance of the heme Soret peak using a spectrophotometer. An example absorbance spectrum of the eluate from a 5-ml Ni-NTA column preparation of IsdH is shown (“initial denaturation,” Figure 4).Wash the resin with 4 × 10 CV heme wash buffer and monitor the eluate of these steps for heme content by recording the absorbance of the heme Soret peak using a spectrophotometer. Repeat the wash steps until the heme content of the eluate is minimized (see Note 10).",

Example UV/Vis spectroscopic analysis of eluted heme fractions. His-tagged IsdH from a 2-L expression culture was bound to 5 ml Ni-NTA resin and on-column heme removal was performed. Initial denaturation was performed with 50 ml denaturing buffer, and heme washes were performed with 4 × 50 ml heme wash buffer. The UV/Vis spectrum for each heme removal elution is shown, with progressively less heme (λSoret = 385-405 nm).Re-fold the bound protein by resuspending the resin in 10 CV equilibration buffer and incubating the slurry for 5 min.Elute the equilibration buffer and wash the resin with an additional 10 CV equilibration buffer.Elute any protein still bound to the resin by washing with 2 × 5 CV high imidazole buffer and check the eluate for protein content by recording the A280. Transfer ≥ 50 µl sample into an Eppendorf® UVette® within a UVette® adapter and record the absorbance at 280 nm using a spectrophotometer.Combine the desired eluted protein fractions and check the heme content of the eluted protein using the methods described in the Data Analysis section.
