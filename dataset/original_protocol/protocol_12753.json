    "1. Integration of a human GOI into the BW25141 E. coli strain\nCloning of the GOI\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplify a 500 bp length of a human GOI containing various candidate target sites via standard PCR methods with primers containing NotI and XhoI restriction enzyme sites.\n\t\tNOTE: In this experiment, the GOI was the human EMX1 gene.\nDigest both the PCR product and the pgrg3613 vector with NotI and XhoI restriction enzymes.\nGel purify the desired fragments (500 bp and 12 kb).\nLigate the fragments together using T4 ligase. To do this, mix 50 ng of digested pgrg36 and 6 ng of PCR insert in a reaction volume of 20 μL containing 1x ligase buffer and 0.5 U ligase enzyme. Incubate at room temperature (RT) overnight.\nTransform the ligated plasmid into DH5-α competent cells. Grow the resulting transformants on Luria broth (LB) agar plates containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL) at 32 °C and incubate overnight. Pick up a colony and grow it in LB media containing ampicillin overnight. Isolate the plasmid DNA from the E. coli, using a commercially available miniprep Kit. Confirm the insertion of the GOI fragment by Sanger sequencing the plasmid obtained from the mini-plasmid preparation (mini-prep)13.\nPreparation of the BW25141-GOI\nTransform the obtained pgrg36-GOI plasmid into the BW25141 E. coli strain. It is essential to use a BW25141 strain in order to minimize the number of false positive colonies.",
    "Grow the transformed cells in the LB buffer at 32 °C overnight. GOI is inserted into the genomic DNA of the BW25141 strain (BW25141-GOI). Remove the pgrg36-GOI plasmid from the BW25141-GOI strain using the standard pgrg36 protocol13. Briefly, dilute a colony (approximately 107-fold) and grow it on an LB plate at 42 °C overnight. Streak the colonies on the LB plate and grow them at 42 °C overnight.\nConfirm the correct GOI insertion by colony PCR, using the primers suggested in the pgrg36 protocol: 5'-GATGCTGGTGGCGAAGCTGT-3' and 5'-GATGACGGTTTGTCACATGGA-3'. The primer amplifies the genomic DNA insertion site, and the size of the resulting PCR product will be 904 bp plus the size of the insert (500 bp in this case).\nPrepare electrocompetent BW25141-GOI cells (a detailed protocol is described in steps 3.2.6–3.2.10).\n2. Preparation of the Cas9 variant library\nLibrary preparation\nTransform the Cas9 vector7 into a commercial E. coli mutator strain (Table of Materials) and follow the manufacturer’s instructions to obtain a variant library (the Mutator library).\nPerform error-prone PCR on the whole WT Cas9 sequence in the Cas9 vector, using an error-prone PCR kit (Table of Materials).\n\t\tNOTE: The low-error rate protocol was adopted in the Sniper-Cas9 case to avoid disrupting the original function of the protein.\nDigest the Cas9 vector with appropriate restriction enzymes. Gel purify the PCR product (from step 2.1.2) and the digested backbone.\n\t\tNOTE: The size of the SpCas9 gene is about 4.3 kb. XhoI and KpnI were chosen to digest pBLC-SpCas9 vector which was used in the Sniper-Cas9 case.\nAssemble the backbone fragment (from step 2.1.3) and the insert amplified using error-prone PCR (from step 2.1.3) via isothermal in vitro recombination.",
    "NOTE: More than 500 ng of backbone is needed to obtain a high concentration of library (error-prone PCR [EP] library). Two different error-prone PCR kits were used to prepare EP libraries in the Sniper-Cas9 case (EP library I and II).\nPurify the products from the assembly (from step 2.1.4) using a DNA purification kit that enables low-volume elution (Table of Materials). Elute with 6 μL of nuclease-free water (NFW) and measure the concentration of DNA.\nTransform more than 500 ng of Cas9 library vector (for each of three libraries) into 50 μL of electrocompetent E. coli cells (Table of Materials). See the electroporation protocol in steps 3.2.1-3.2.4. For this library preparation, use 1 mL of SOC medium instead of 250 μL per 50 μL of competent cells.\nMake 1:100, 1:1,000, and 1:10,000 dilutions of the mixture containing the recovered cells with SOC medium. Plate the diluted cells on 100 mm LB agar plates supplemented with chloramphenicol (12.5 μg/mL). Plate the remaining cells on a 245 mm2 plate. Incubate at 37 °C overnight.\nCalculation of library complexity\nPhotograph the dilution plates via a gel documentation system or an ordinary digital camera. Run OpenCFU software14 and upload the photographs of the dilution plates. Set the counting area inside a plate and remove false colonies.\nManually multiply the number of colonies by the dilution factor to obtain the original number of transformants. Convert these numbers into logarithmic form (base 10). Calculate the average to determine the complexity of the library.\nWhen the desired complexity value is obtained, gather all the colonies on the 245 mm square plate (from step 2.1.7) using a spreader and 20 mL of LB supplemented with chloramphenicol. Do not grow the gathered colonies and purify the plasmid library using a commercial midiprep kit.",
    "NOTE: The higher the library complexity, the better. When Sniper-Cas9 was identified, a diversity of 3 x 106 was achieved for each library.\n3. Positive and negative screening for evolving Cas9\nTarget selection and plasmid construction\nSelect a target sgRNA spacer sequence in the GOI. Substitute one or two residues in the random nucleotide to produce a mismatched sequence.\n\t\tNOTE: Human EMX1 target site 3 (GAGTCCGAGCAGAAGAAGAA with GGG PAM) was used in the Sniper-Cas9 case. Followings are the mismatched sequences used: GAGTCCGAGCAGAAagAGAA, GAacCCGAGCAGAAGAAGAA, GAGTCCGAGCAGAgGAAGAA, and GAGcCCGAGCAGAAGAAGAA.\nInsert the mismatched sequence (see step 3.1.1) into the sgRNA plasmid using standard oligonucleotide (oligo) cloning procedures7.\nInsert the mismatched sequence with a PAM at the 3' end into p11-lacY-wtx1 (Table of Materials) to construct the ccdB plasmid using standard oligo cloning procedures15.\nPreparation of Sniper-screening E. coli competent cells\nThaw BW25141-GOI electrocompetent cells on ice.\nAdd 1 ng each of the ccdB plasmid and the sgRNA plasmid with double mismatches into 50 μL of thawed BW25141-GOI cells. Gently mix the cells by pipetting and move them into a prechilled 0.1 cm electroporation cuvette.\nTransform the E. coli with the two plasmids via electroporation. Add 250 μL of SOC medium immediately after electroporation. Gently pipette the solution to mix the cells and the medium. Transfer the mixture to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\n\t\tNOTE: For maximum efficiency, set the voltage at 1.80 kV, and the runtime should be between 4.8 ms and 5.0 ms.\nRecover the transformed cells and incubate them at 32 °C for 1 h with gentle shaking.\nPlate 125 μL of the recovered cells on an ampicillin (50 μg/mL)/kanamycin (25 μg/mL) LB agar plate (culture condition). Plate the remaining cells on an ampicillin/kanamycin/arabinose (1.5 mg/mL) LB agar plate (ccdB-expressing condition). Incubate at 32 °C overnight.",
    "Check for the absence of surviving colonies on the ccdB-expressing condition plate. Gather colonies from the culture condition plate using a spreader and culture them in 250 mL of super optimal broth (SOB) medium supplemented with 50 μg/mL of ampicillin and 25 μg/mL of kanamycin at 32 °C, with gentle shaking.\nWhen the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) reaches 0.4, chill the flask on ice. Prepare prechilled deionized water and a prechilled 10% glycerol solution (sterilize before use).\nCentrifuge (at 4,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C) the cells and discard the supernatant. Add 200 mL of prechilled deionized water. Resuspend the cells using a 10 mL serological pipette. Repeat this step 3x.\nWash the cells with 50 mL of prechilled 10% glycerol solution. Centrifuge them as before (at 4,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C).\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 300 μL of 10% glycerol solution. Make 50 μL aliquots and freeze them in liquid nitrogen. Store the cells (Sniper-screening cells) at -80 °C.\nSniper-screening\nTransform the Sniper-screening cells (from step 3.2.10) with 100 ng of the Cas9 variant plasmids from each library (from step 2.2.3.See steps 2.1.1 and 2.1.4). Follow the electroporation steps described in steps 3.2.1–3.2.3.\nTransfer 250 μL of the cells to a fresh 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Add 250 pg of ATC to make a final concentration of 10 ng/mL. Recover both ATC-containing and ATC-free cells (see step 3.2.4 for the recovery step).\nPlate 25 μL of recovered ATC-free cells on a chloramphenicol/kanamycin LB agar plate (nonselective condition). Add ATC to the recovered ATC-containing cells to make a final concentration of 100 ng/mL on a 245 mm LB plate. Immediately plate the cells on a chloramphenicol/kanamycin/arabinose LB agar plate (selective condition). Incubate overnight at 32 °C.",
    "NOTE: The size and the number of the LB plate are determined by the size of diversity of the screening covers. In the case of a 100 mm Petri dish with 20 mL of LB, add 2 μg of ATC.\nPhotograph the plates. Count the number of viable colonies using OpenCFU software14. (See step 2.2.1) Make sure that the number of colonies on the nonselective plate is at least 10x larger than the diversity of the library to cover all variants.\nCalculate the survival frequency as follows.\n\t\tSurvival frequency = the number of colonies on a selective plate / (the number of colonies on a nonselective plate x 10)\nPool the colonies that survived on the selective plates from all three libraries. Incubate the surviving colonies in 250 mL of LB medium supplemented with 12.5 μg/mL chloramphenicol at 42 °C overnight. Isolate the screened Cas9 library DNA using a midiprep kit.\n\t\tNOTE: This step clears the sgRNA plasmid.\nRepeat the screening process from steps 3.3.1–3.3.6 until the survival frequency reaches a plateau. Use 10 ng of the selected Cas9 plasmid for transformation and 10 ng/mL of ATC during recovery. Maintain the ATC concentration at 100 ng/mL for the selective condition.\nShuffling and the second screening\nShuffle the selected pooled variants using the following DNA-shuffling protocol. PCR amplify the Cas9 insert in the Cas9 plasmid using flanking primers, 150 nucleotides from the insert boundaries. Digest 2 μg of amplified PCR product with DNase I for 1 min at 37 °C.\nPurify fragments 70–200 bp in length using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR amplify the purified fragments. Use the product as a template to PCR amplify the Cas9 insert with appropriate primers flanking Cas9. Use the final PCR product to construct a Cas9 library as described in step 2.1.4.",
    "Prepare new Sniper-screening cells (see section 3.2) with another mismatched sgRNA plasmid (see step 3.1.1). Redo the screening process (sections 3.2–3.3) until the survival rate reaches a plateau. Use 10 ng of the selected Cas9 plasmid for transformation and 10 ng/mL ATC during recovery. Maintain the ATC concentration at 10 ng/mL for the selective condition.\nSelection of evolved Cas9 mutant plasmids\nAfter the last screening step, randomly pick one hundred colonies from the selective plate and culture them in chloramphenicol-containing LB medium at 42 °C overnight.\nIsolate the plasmids using a miniprep procedure and Sanger-sequence the inserts using sequencing primers within Cas9.\nSelect the top three most frequent variants to test them in human cell lines.\n4. Delivery of Cas9 as an RNP with truncated sgRNA\nTarget gene selection using Cas-OFFinder\nPick target sites with Cas-OFFinder (http://www.rgenome.net/cas-offinder/). Select the PAM type appropriate for the specific type of Cas9 and the target genome (human, mouse, zebrafish, etc.). Fill in the Query sequences tab, choose the Mismatch number, and click the Submit button.\nAfter a few seconds, the on-target (with a mismatch number of ‘0’) and off-target sites will appear. In general, choose the off-target sites with one to three mismatches.\nPreparation of the sgRNA template\nOrder crRNA and tracrRNA oligos with the following template sequences, namely crRNA sequence: 5'-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGTTTTAGAGCTAGAA-3'; tracrRNA sequence: 5'-AGCACCGACTCGGTGCCACTTTTTCAAGTTGATAACGGACTAGCCTTATTTTAACTTGCTATTTCTAGCTCTAAAAC-3'. Fill N20 in the crRNA sequence with the target sequence obtained in step 4.1.2. To design truncated sgRNAs, remove bases from the 5' end to obtain N19, N18, or N17 sgRNA sequences.",
    "Prepare the PCR mixture for amplification of the sgRNA-encoding sequence as follows: combine 10 μL of 5x buffer, 0.5 μL of crRNA oligo (100 pmol/μL), 0.5 μL of tracrRNA oligo (100 pmol/μL), 2.5 μL of dNTPs (10 mM each), 0.5 μL of DNA polymerase, and 36 μL of NFW (Table of Materials).\nAmplify the template using the following conditions, namely, for the initial denaturation: 1 min at 98 °C; for the denaturation, annealing, and extension: 10 s at 98 °C, 15 s at 54 °C, 20 s at 72 °C, for 25 cycles; for the final extension: 5 min at 72 °C.\nAnalyze 2 μL of the amplified template DNA (from step 4.2.3) on a 2% agarose gel.

Add 0.5 μL of DNase (2 U/μL) to the reaction mixture and incubate at 37 °C for 15–30 min. Purify the sgRNA using an RNA purification kit.",
    "To reduce the toxicity caused by an innate immune response triggered by the 5'-triphosphate on the sgRNA16, remove the 5'-triphosphate from the guide RNAs with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP) as follows: treat 10 µg of in vitro-transcribed RNA with 250 U of CIP for 3 h at 37 °C in the presence of 100 U of RNase inhibitor. Purify the CIP-treated sgRNA using an RNA purification kit.\n5.
