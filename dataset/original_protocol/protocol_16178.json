    "Essential 8 (E8) medium was originally developed by the laboratory of James Thomson (Chen et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.866#cpz1866-bib-0003]) based on the mTeSR1 medium, one of the first chemically defined media for the feeder-free culture of hiPSCs. The medium contains eight essential components required to support the growth and expansion of hiPSCs and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), providing a simpler medium for pluripotent stem cell propagation.\nThe propagation and culture of hiPSCs and hESCs with E8 medium requires the use of Matrigel matrix to aid cell attachment and expansion. The Matrigel matrix is a mixture of extracellular matrix proteins derived from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) mouse sarcoma, which includes laminin, collagen IV, heparin sulfate proteoglycans, entactin/nidogen, and several growth factors. Alternative coating matrices that have been reported to effectively support the culture of iPSCs include Geltrex, Vitronectin XF™, and CellAdhere™ Laminin-521.\nHuman iPSCs are more sensitive to enzymatic dissociation and prone to apoptosis and death, which often leads to poor survival during hiPSC propagation. The use of an EDTA-based enzyme-free dissociation method significantly improves cell survival and replating efficiency during hiPSC culture and propagation (Beers et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.866#cpz1866-bib-0001]). With standard seeding density, the majority of hiPSC lines reached 70%-80% confluence within 4-5 days and can be continually passaged or frozen down (Cheng et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.866#cpz1866-bib-0004]; Long et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.866#cpz1866-bib-0009]). Any spontaneously differentiated cells observed under the microscope should be removed from the culture before passaging.",
    "Cryopreservation is important to safeguard the valuable hiPSC lines. It is recommended that hiPSCs should be cryopreserved at early passages during cell propagation. A large batch of hiPSC frozen stock should be made and stored at −150°C (or liquid nitrogen) once the hiPSCs have been fully characterized. Cryopreserved hiPSCs with intermediate passage numbers are useful back-up resources for future expansion in case of unexpected cell death or contamination; in addition, cryopreserved hiPSCs in frozen in a deep freezer vials can also be immediately used in downstream applications such as RNA-seq analysis and mass-spectrum-based proteomic profiling.\nThis protocol describes the steps for routine culture and cryopreservation of hiPSCs that have been successfully used in our laboratory for over 100 hiPSC lines in the last 3 years. The hiPSCs are cultured and maintained in a feeder-free condition with chemically defined medium. The cells exhibit characteristics of high-quality hiPSCs based on growth rate, genetic stability, morphology, and phenotypes. They also maintain the ability to differentiate into three germ layer tissues in vivo (Chen et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.866#cpz1866-bib-0003]).\nMaterials\nMatrigel, hESC-Qualified Matrix, LDEV-free (Corning, cat. no. 354277), stored at −80°C\nDMEM-F12 (Gibco, cat. no. 11320033)\nConfluent hiPSCs (at 70%-80% confluence; if iPSCs are from stock vials stored in liquid nitrogen or a −150°C deep freezer, go to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.866#cpz1866-prot-0002])\nComplete E8 medium (see recipe)\nVersene solution (ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. no. 15040066), stored at 4°C\n10 mM Y-27632 dihydrochloride (see recipe)\nCryoStor CS10 (StemCell Technologies, cat. no. 7930), stored at 4°C\n1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, 4°C\n50-ml conical tube (Falcon, cat. no. 352098), 4°C\nCostar 6-well clear TC-treated multiple-well plate (Corning, 3506)\nLaminar flow hood\nPhase-contrast microscope\n2-ml Costar aspirating pipets (Corning, cat. no. 9186)\n15-ml conical tubes\nHumidified 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator\nCryogenic tubes (Corning, cat. no. 430488)\nCorning CoolCell Containers (cat. no. 432000)",
    "Liquid nitrogen cell storage container or −150°C deep freezer\nPreparation of Matrigel coating\n1. Matrigel arrives in 10-ml bottles with varying concentrations across lots. Check the protein concentration of Matrigel on the label before working with it. Matrigel coating of 6-well plates for hiPSC culture uses 8.7 µg/cm2 of Matrigel (0.1 mg/ml, 1 ml/well to coat 6-well plates). Aliquot the desired volume of Matrigel stock solution (depending on the number of plates used in a typical experiment) into microcentrifuge tubes (e.g., 250 μl/vial) and store them at −20°C.\nTips: The day before aliquoting the Matrigel stock, prechill all materials, including microcentrifuge tubes, racks, and pipet tips, to 4°C in a refrigerator. In addition, remove the Matrigel stock bottle from the freezer, immediately submerge it in ice, and let it thaw at 4°C overnight. Aliquoting of Matrigel should always be performed on ice.\n2. On the day of coating, thaw an aliquot of Matrigel on ice. Add a small volume (300-500 μl) of ice-cold (0°C-4°C) sterile DMEM-F12 medium to dilute the Matrigel aliquots.\nThe Matrigel matrix will gel rapidly at 22°C-35°C, and diluting it with a small amount of ice-cold sterile DMEM-F12 medium to avoid direct handling of highly concentrated Matrigel will prevent this.\n3. Transfer the diluted Matrigel aliquot to a prechilled 50-ml conical tube containing a volume of ice-cold DMEM-F12 to obtain a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml as the Matrigel coating solution. The dilution volume is calculated for each lot of Matrigel based on the protein concentration.\nThe detailed information is listed in the Certificate of Analysis for Matrigel on the Corning website.\n4. Pipet the Matrigel coating solution into the wells of 6-well plates at 1 ml/well. To coat 96-well plates, add 0.1 ml/well Matrigel coating solution.",
    "5. Incubate the 6-well plates with Matrigel coating solution at room temperature for at least 1 h. After incubation, Matrigel-coated plates can be used immediately or stored at 4°C for up to 1 week before use. For storage, seal the plate (containing the Matrigel coating solution) with Parafilm to prevent dehydration. The stored Matrigel-coated plates should be placed in the tissue culture hood prior to use to pre-equilibrate to room temperature.\nDissociation of hiPSCs for passaging\n6. Once the hiPSCs reach 70%-80% confluence, examine them under a tissue culture microscope to identify any spontaneously differentiated cells (shown on Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.866#cpz1866-fig-0002]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ad64252d-a76f-493c-994e-06fbd497859f/cpz1866-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nMorphology of iPSC colonies observed via microscopy. (A) A normal hiPSC colony with a distinct border and a well-defined edge consisting of cells with a large nucleus (a high ratio of nucleus to cytoplasm). (B) Spontaneously differentiating cells inside a hiPSC colony (arrow).\n7. Remove differentiated cells by marking them under microscope and scratching them off by using a P20 pipet with pipet tips. This is especially crucial when there is an excessive number of differentiated cells.\n8. Remove medium from the wells containing hiPSCs with an aspirating pipet and rinse the wells once quickly with Versene solution (1 ml/well in a 6-well plate).\nVersene solution is an EDTA solution that gently dissociates cells without the use of enzymes.\n9. Add Versene solution to the wells (1 ml/well in a 6-well plate). Gently swirl the plate to cover the entire well surface.\n10. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 3-4 min. When cells start to separate and round up (forming cell colonies and holes when observed under the microscope), they are ready to be removed from the wells.\nThis process can take longer than 5 min for certain cell lines or in larger culture vessels.",
    "11. Carefully aspirate the Versene solution with an aspirating pipet.\nProceed to cryopreservation (step 18b), or continue passaging the cells in 6 well plates as described below.\n12. Prepare an appropriate amount of complete E8 medium containing 10 µM Y-27632 hydrocholoride by adding 10 µl of 10 mM Y-27632 dihydrochloride stock per 10 ml of prewarmed (room-temperature) complete E8 medium. Gently squirt 500 μl to 1 ml/well of this into each well of the 6-well plates. Collect cell aggregates from the plates in a 15-ml conical tube as follows.\n         \nCell aggregates should be appropriately sized for plating (10-30 cells per aggregate). Little or no extra pipetting is required to break up cell clumps after Versene solution treatment.\nWork with multiple wells at a time, and work quickly to collect cells after adding E8 medium to the well(s).\nY-27632 is an inhibitor of Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK). It should be added to the medium immediately before use.\n13. Aspirate the Matrigel coating solution from the Matrigel-coated 6-well plates from step 5 (if removing from 4°C storage, first equilibrate the plates to room temperature for 1 hr). Immediately add 1 ml room-temperature pre-warmed complete E8 medium with 10 µM Y-27632 dihydrochloride to each 6-well plate.\n14. Determine the numbers of wells and the split ratio needed to seed the cell aggregates (from step 12) at the desired density into the wells of these plates. The final volume of complete E8 medium should be 2 ml/well in 6-well plates.\nIf the hiPSCs are younger than passage 10, the culture can be split every 4-5 days at a 1:2-1:4 ratio. If the hiPSCs are older than 10 passages, the colonies can be split at 1:6-1:10 every 4-5 days.",
    "15. Move the plate in several figure-eight motions (with slow and gentle movements) to evenly distribute cells across the surface of the wells.\n16. Gently place the culture plate in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator and incubate the cells overnight.\n17. The next day, replace the old medium with 2 ml/well fresh complete E8 medium without Y-27632. Continue to culture the cells, replacing the medium daily with 2 ml/well fresh complete E8 medium without Y-27632, until they reach 70%-80% confluence (usually 4-5 days).\nIt is normal to see cell debris and small colonies under the microscope the day after passaging. It is important to carefully monitor cell morphology using a microscope every day before medium changes and to remove any differentiated cells.\n18. The hiPSC colonies are generally ready for passaging, or for use in experiments, after 4-5 days in culture. If cryopreservation is necessary, the hiPSCs should be denser than 80% confluent for this purpose.\n         \nFor hiPSC passage: When the cells reach 70%-80% confluence, repeat steps 6-17.\nFor hiPSC cryopreservation: When the cells reach ∼80% confluence, dissociate them with Versene solution as in steps 6-11. Aspirate the spent medium and then gently add CryoStor™ CS10 cell cryopreservation medium (700 µl/well per 6-well plate). Dislodge cells by gently pipetting the medium up and down. Aliquot 350 µl/vial into separate cryogenic vials (hiPSCs from one well of a 6-well plate are stored in two vials). Place the vials in a Corning CoolCell freezing container and store at −80°C at least overnight (or 1-3 days). Then, transfer the vials from the freezing container to a liquid nitrogen tank or −150°C deep freezer for long-term storage.",
    "For further experiments: hiPSCs at 70%-80% confluence can be used for experiments such as hiPSC characterization (Basic Protocols 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.866#cpz1866-prot-0003], 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.866#cpz1866-prot-0005], and 5) and other downstream hiPSC applications (e.g., differentiation to neurons, hepatocytes, and cardiomyocytes, and various organoids).",
    "This protocol describes a centrifugation-free method to recover cryopreserved hiPSCs, which greatly improves hiPSC survival and recovery rate upon thawing. After a vial of frozen hiPSCs is thawed (from a liquid nitrogen tank or −150°C deep freezer) in a 37°C water bath, all the contents in the vial are transferred into one well of a precoated 6-well plate and incubated for 60 min in the presence of 10 μM Y-27632 dihydrochloride. After attachment of hiPSC colonies to the plate is confirmed, the medium is removed and replaced with a fresh complete E8 medium containing 10 µM Y-27632 dihydrochloride.\nMaterials\nFrozen hiPSC stock\n70% (v/v) ethanol\nDry ice\nMatrigel-coated 6-well plate (prepared as described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.866#cpz1866-prot-0001], steps 1-5), pre-equilibrated to room temperature for 1 hr in the hood\nWater bath\nDMEM-F12 (Gibco, cat. no. 11320033)\nHEPES (Gibco, cat. no. 11330-032)\nComplete E8 medium (see recipe)\nVersene solution (ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. no. 15040066), stored at 4°C\n10 mM Y-27632 dihydrochloride (see recipe)\nCryoStor CS10 (StemCell Technologies, cat. no. 7930), stored at 4°C\n1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, 4°C\n50-ml conical tube (Falcon, cat. no. 352098)\nCostar 6-well clear TC-treated multiple well plate (Corning, 3506)\nLaminar-flow hood\nPhase-contrast microscope\n2-ml Costar aspirating pipets (Corning, cat. no. 9186)\n15-ml conical tubes\nHumidified 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator\nCryogenic tubes (Corning, cat. no. 430488)\nCorning CoolCell Containers (cat. no. 432000)\nLiquid nitrogen cell storage container or −150°C deep freezer\n1.

    "2. Thaw the cells by gently swirling the vial in the 37°C water bath until only a small piece of ice remains in the vial (just before it thaws completely).\n3. Transfer the vial to a laminar flow hood and wipe its surface with 70% (v/v) ethanol before opening. If the vial is labeled with a marker, record the information listed on the label before wiping because 70% ethanol may completely erase the written information.\n4. Aspirate the Matrigel-containing solution from a Matrigel-coated 6-well plate (pre-equilibrated to room temperature), and immediately add 5 ml/well of room-temperature prewarmed complete E8 medium with 10 μM Y-27632 dihydrochloride (prepared immediately before use by adding 10 µl of 10 mM Y-27632 dihydrochloride stock to 10 ml complete E8 medium).\n5. Transfer the thawed hiPSCs from the vial to the prepared 6-well plate dropwise, evenly distributing them into the complete E8 medium in the well.\n6. Move the plate in several figure-eight motions (with slow and gentle movements) to distribute cells evenly across the surface of the bottom of 6-well plates.\n7. Gently place the 6-well plate into a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator and incubate the cells for 1 hr.\n8. Examine cell attachment under a microscope to make sure most cells have attached to the well. If not, extend the incubation time for an additional 30 min (hiPSCs may have variations in attachment rates).\n9. Carefully remove the supernatant (containing freezing medium) from the plate and add 5 ml/well of room-temperature prewarmed fresh complete E8 medium with 10 µM Y-27632 dihydrochloride.\n10.

    "11. The next day, remove the medium (containing Y-27632 dihydrochloride) and replace with 2 ml/well complete E8 medium without Y-27632 dihydrochloride. Return the plate to the 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator.\n12. After the second day post thawing, remove the old medium and feed the hiPSCs with 2 ml/well fresh complete E8 medium daily. Monitor cells and assess growth until they reach 70%-80% confluence (∼2-5 days after thawing), when they are ready for splitting and passaging.\nIt is normal to see cell debris and small colonies after thawing. The cells are now ready to use for characterization (Basic Protocols 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.866#cpz1866-prot-0003]-5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.866#cpz1866-prot-0006]), cryopreservation, or other experiments of interest.\n13.

    "Human iPSCs possess unique properties of self-renewal and differentiation into all of the cell types in the human body. However, spontaneous differentiation occurs frequently during hiPSC propagation and, if left unchecked, can reduce hiPSC self-renewal and/or differentiation into the intended cell types. Phenotypic characterization of hiPSCs using a panel of pluripotency markers is a standard method to efficiently qualify hiPSCs. This protocol describes how to evaluate the expression of pluripotency markers in hiPSCs using immunocytochemistry. The hiPSCs are plated, stained, and analyzed using a microscope in 96-well-plate format. Immunocytochemistry provides visualization of pluripotency markers in individual cells within a colony, allowing the subcellular localization of each marker to be assessed. This analysis should be performed after the removal of transgenes (usually after 10 passages) and before downstream applications such as differentiation into neurons or liver organoids.\nMaterials\nMatrigel, hESC-Qualified Matrix, LDEV-free (Corning, cat. no. 354277), stored at −80°C\nDMEM-F12 (Gibco, cat. no. 11320033)\nConfluent hiPSCs in 6-well plates (from Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.866#cpz1866-prot-0001], step 18c)\nComplete E8 medium (see recipe)\nVersene solution (ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. no. 15040066), stored at 4°C\n10 mM Y-27632 dihydrochloride (see recipe)\n32% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 15714-S)\nDPBS with calcium and magnesium (ThermoFisher Scientific, 14040141)\nTriton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, T8787)\nBlocking solution (Cell Staining Buffer, BioLegend, 420201)\nAppropriate primary and secondary antibodies\nHoechst 33342 (Invitrogen, cat. no.

    "1. Prepare a Matrigel-coated 96-well plate by adapting Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.866#cpz1866-prot-0001], steps 1-5, adjusting the volumes by adding 100 μl/well of a diluted Matrigel coating solution consisting of 0.1 mg/ml Matrigel in DMEM-F12 medium. Incubate at room temperature for 1 hr in the hood.\n2. Dissociate hiPSC colonies using Versene solution following Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.866#cpz1866-prot-0001], steps 6-12. Combine the cells from one well of a 6-well plate with 5.5 ml complete E8 medium supplemented with 10 µM Y-27632 dihydrochloride (prepared immediately before use by adding 10 µl of 10 mM Y-27632 dihydrochloride stock to 10 ml complete E8 medium) to obtain a total volume of 6 ml of dissociated hiPSCs.\n3. Remove the Matrigel coating solution from the 96-well plate (from step 1) and seed 100 µl/well of the diluted hiPSC suspension into the Matrigel-coated 96-well plate. The number of wells to be seeded with hiPSCs is dependent on the experimental needs.\n4. Examine under the microscope to confirm the hiPSC seeding and incubate in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator overnight.\nDay 2\n5. Change the medium by removing the old medium and adding 100 µl/well of room-temperature prewarmed complete E8 medium without Y27632.\nDay 3\n6. Check the cells under the microscope to ensure that they are 30%-50% confluent. If that is the case, remove medium and fix the cells by adding 100 µl/well of 4% paraformaldehyde diluted in DPBS with calcium and magnesium. Incubate the 96-well plate for 15 min at room temperature.\n7. After hiPSC fixation, wash the cells three times with 100 µl/well of DPBS with calcium and magnesium (leave the DPBS in the wells for 5 min each time), and remove all the solution from each well after cell wash.",

    "Flow cytometry is an alternative way to quantitatively examine the expression of pluripotency markers in hiPSCs. This method can quantitate pluripotency marker expression in cell populations, and it provides more quantitative data analysis compared than immunocytochemistry, whereas the immunocytochemistry analysis using fluorescence microscopy provides qualitative information such as subcellular localizations of the markers.

    "By definition, pluripotency refers to a cell's ability to differentiate into all cell types of the body. Cell morphology, growth property, karyotype, and epigenetic markers may provide some clues to whether the cells are likely to be pluripotent, but they are indirect and unreliable. Random differentiation through embryoid body formation or directed differentiation into specific lineages can in theory address this question, but such in vitro culture methods are prone to false conclusions due to artificial effects caused by inconsistent reagents or poor technical skills. Conversely, injecting hiPSCs into immunocompromised mice to test their ability to form teratomas is a simple and reliable method to find out whether a particular hiPSC line is capable of differentiating into a variety of tissues, including cell types that originate from all three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) during normal embryonic development.\nIn addition to confirming whether a particular cell line is truly pluripotent in a qualitative manner, teratoma formation assay can also provide semiquantitative insights into a cell line's differentiation propensity. Not all hiPSC lines have equal differentiation tendency toward all three germ layers, as the original source of the hiPSCs and the reprogramming method can significantly influence differentiation propensity. An abundance of tissues from one particular germ layer formed in teratomas may hint at whether the hiPSC line is a suitable choice for in vitro differentiation into the intended cell type for further studies or disease modeling.\nBecause teratoma assays involve the use of laboratory animals, these experiments need to be approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IAUCU).\nMaterials\nhiPSCs (∼80% confluence) in 6-well plates (see Strategic Planning)\nComplete E8 medium (see recipe) supplemented with 25 mM HEPES (Gibco, cat. no. 11330-032), pH 7.4\nMatrigel, hESC-Qualified Matrix, LDEV-free (Corning, cat. no. 354277), stored at −80°C",

Count cells and transfer 8 × 106 cells into a sterile microcentrifuge tube. Adjust the total volume to 400 μl by adding additional E8 medium with 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.4). Cool the cell suspension on ice.\n4. Thaw an aliquot of Matrigel on ice. Mix 200 μl of Matrigel with the cold cell suspension so that the final Matrigel concentration is 33% (v/v). Store the tube on ice.\n5. Turn on the gas tank regulator to supply pure oxygen to the isoflurane vaporizer. Set the isoflurane concentration to 4%-5%.\nIt is important to minimize leakage of isoflurane into the procedure room during the entire process. An approved gas scavenging system should be used to collect used isoflurane vapor, and the entire anesthetic station should be certified annually.\n6. Place two NSG mice into the induction chamber of the vaporizer.",
    "7. Attach a 25-G needle to a 1-ml sterile syringe and draw the entire 600 μl of cell suspension from step 4 into the syringe.\n8. Take one anesthetized mouse out of the isoflurane chamber. Lay the mouse on its back and place its muzzle inside the nose cone of the isoflurane vaporizer.\n9. Quickly inject 0.1 ml of cells subcutaneously into the groin area of one of the mouse's hind legs and then inject 0.1 ml of cells into the groin area of the other hind leg. Place the injected mouse back into its cage.\n10. Take the second mouse out of the chamber and repeat the injection procedures described in steps 8 and 9.\nIt is important to inject both mice quickly to avoid warming of the cell suspension inside the syringe, which may lead to gelling of the Matrigel.\n11. Turn off the isoflurane vaporizer and oxygen tank gas regulator.\n12. Mark the cage card with cell line information and injection date. Injected mice should wake up in a few minutes. Return the cage to the animal room.\n13. Check the injected mice on the next day and then on a weekly basis. When the tumors reach ∼1 cm in diameter, monitor the mice every other day to make sure that the tumors do not exceed the size limit (usually 2 cm diameter) specified by the Animal Care and Use Committee and the specific animal facility.\nThe rate of tumor growth varies widely depending on the cell lines, but for most hiPSC lines, teratomas are ready to be harvested 6-12 weeks post injection.\n14. When one or both tumors nearly reach the size limit, euthanize the mouse by CO2 asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation.",
    "Protocols for euthanizing mice can be found in many books and protocols, such as the laboratory manual published by the Cold Spring Harbor Lab Press, Manipulating the Mouse Embryos, 4th edition (Behringer et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.866#cpz1866-bib-0002]).\n15. Lay the euthanized mouse on its back and spray 70% ethanol on the ventral side to wet the fur. Use a pair of sharp scissors to make a large cut (∼2 cm long) in the skin of the abdomen area. Use gloved fingers to grasp each side of the cut and tear the skin apart to expose the teratomas, which should sit between the skin and muscle body wall (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.866#cpz1866-fig-0004]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1f3fdbf7-679c-47aa-8001-f75f685ab6fc/cpz1866-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nGross morphology of a teratoma.

Use a pair of iris forceps and a pair of scissors to carefully remove the teratomas and fix them in 10% Neutral Buffered Formalin in 50-ml conical tubes.\n17. Embed the fixed teratomas in paraffin, section them to make 5-μm-thick slides, and then stain with H&E (hematoxylin and eosin) following standard procedures; or send them to a contract histology lab to perform these procedures.\n18. Examine the stained slides under a light microscope. Alternatively, the entire slide can be scanned using a digital slide scanner, such as the NanoZoomer scanner made by Hamamatsu, Inc. The goal is to look for tissues derived from various germ layers.",
    "19. Truly pluripotent hiPSCs should give rise to tissues derived from all three germ layers. As shown in Fig 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.866#cpz1866-fig-0005], the tissue most often used to represent ectoderm is the neural epithelium, the most reliable and obvious tissue for mesoderm is cartilage or bone, and the most typical endodermal tissue is the gut, such as intestine. Most properly derived hiPSC lines can give rise to all three germ layer tissues, but their differentiation propensities are often biased toward one or two layers, resulting in large differences in tissue abundances between germ layers. This may be caused by epigenetic memories retained from the donor cell type used for hiPSC reprogramming, partial differentiation due to improper culturing conditions, or mishandling before or during the hiPSC injection process. When a particular cell line fails to yield tissues from all three germ layers, it is recommended that the teratoma assay be repeated with a different hiPSC clone from the same reprograming event. If no other clones are available, subcloning the original hiPSCs may yield good subclones through the elimination of partially differentiated cells or cells that have accumulated deleterious mutations (such as abnormal karyotypes) during the culture process.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/bad3ba76-8ad2-4883-8864-8e89f506e3db/cpz1866-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nTypical images representing tissues from the three germ layers in the teratomas formed by hiPSCs. (A) Black arrows point to neural epithelium, often referred to as neural rosettes, which are the most typical ectodermal tissue in teratoma assays. Some of the tissues contain pigmented cells (white arrow), resembling retina. (B) Arrows point to cartilage, which is the most easily recognizable tissue derived from the mesoderm. (C) Arrows point to gut tissues, resembling intestine, which is a typical representative endoderm tissue.",
    "The reprogramming of somatic cells via the Sendai virus delivery system has become a common approach to efficiently generate hiPSCs. The advantages of the Sendai virus reprogramming system include safety for humans, as no human diseases are linked to this virus; broad cellular tropism, as it binds to ubiquitous sialic acid as the cellular receptor to enter human cells; and a non-integrating viral replication mechanism that does not alter the host genome. Sendai-virus-mediated hiPSC induction has been shown to maintain genomic integrity with minimal level of genetic aberration. However, it still takes a few months for transgenes to be cleared from the reprogrammed cells. Validation of the clearance of reprogramming materials from hiPSCs is an important quality control for establishing hiPSC lines. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) with primers binding to the reprogramming factors is considered one of the best methods for detecting the transgenes. In this protocol, an RT-PCR analysis is used to confirm that no residual transgenes of viral origin remain in the hiPSCs when the non-integrative Sendai virus delivery system was used to generate hiPSCs. The original human somatic cells that were freshly transduced with the Sendai virus system are used as a positive control for this experiment. It is important to use hiPSCs that have cleared genetic materials from iPSC induction for other downstream applications such as differentiation into neurons or organoids.\nMaterials\nSomatic cells (e.g., fibroblasts)\nComplete somatic cell culture medium (e.g., DMEM/10% FBS for fibroblasts)\nCytoTune™-iPS 2.0 Sendai Reprogramming Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, A16517)\nTrypLE Express Enzyme (ThermoFisher Scientific, 12605010)\nDPBS without calcium and magnesium (ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. no. 14190144)\nConfluent hiPSCs in 6-well plates (from Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.866#cpz1866-prot-0001], step 18c)\nQiagen RNeasy Plus Mini Kits (Qiagen, 74034) or other RNA isolation protocols",
