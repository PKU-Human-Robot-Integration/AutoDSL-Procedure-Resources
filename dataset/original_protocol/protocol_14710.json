Dissection Buffer\nPrepare 15 mM HEPES (1 M), 6.5mg/ ml glucose, 1.3 mM MgSO4 (1 M), 20 mM KCl (2 M) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in 1x HBSS.\nAdjust pH to 7.4 with NaOH.\nFilter and store at -20 °C.\n2. Slice Culture Media\nPrepare 2% B-27, 1% N2 supplement, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% Glutamax, and 1.5 mg/ml Glucose in Neurobasal-A Medium minus phenol Red.\nFilter and store at -20 °C. Thaw as needed, and discard after 1 week at 4 °C.\n\tNote: The following procedure can be done up to one day before starting the dissection.\n3% low melting point agarose\n\tNote: The following procedure can be done up to one day before starting the dissection.",
    "Mix 0.9 g low melting point agarose into ~31 ml of dissection buffer, microwave for 25 sec with cap loose. Microwave until melted and make sure the mixture doesn’t overflow.\nKeep at 55-65 °C until needed.\n\tNote: The following procedure can be done up to one day before starting the dissection.\n4. Coat the Slice Culture Inserts with Laminin\nNote: The following procedure can be done up to one day before starting the dissection.\nIn a tissue culture hood, using sterile forceps, place one slice culture insert in each well of a 6-well plate (match the number of slices you intend to obtain, around 12 can be collected from one procedure. The following procedure is written for six slices). Fill a 15 ml conical tube with 1x PBS (800 µl/insert) and add laminin (10 µg/ml).\nAdd 800 µl of the laminin mixture to the top of each slice culture insert. Incubate at 37 °C until needed.\n5. Preparation for Dissection\nFill each well of a 6-well plate with 1,200 µl of slice culture media. Fill any unused wells with 1,200 µl PBS and fill the center space of the plate with 5 ml 1x PBS. Store this plate at 37 °C.\nSterilize dissection tools in 70% ethanol. Wipe vibratome blade with acetone to remove oil and sterilize before use.\nPlace three 35 mm2 dishes and five 10 cm2 tissue culture dishes in the hood. Fill one 10 cm2 dish with dissection buffer and place on ice.\n\tNote: Process pups one at a time.\n6.

    "Figure 2. Dissection Cuts. These images show the necessary dissection cuts to remove the skull from the brain of a P6 mouse. Cuts are shown as dotted lines. (A) Cut 1 is shown. Cuts 1 and 2 are made from the brainstem/posterior bilaterally connecting to the eye socket on each side.. (B) Cuts 3 and 4 are shown. Cut 3 is made from one eye socket to the other connecting Cuts 1 and 2. Cut 4 begins at the midline of cut 3 and continues towards the tip of the nose dividing the skull between the olfactory bulbs (Scale bar = 4.4 mm). Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53304/53304fig2large.jpg]\nAnesthetize the P6 mouse using isoflurane exposure (100% isoflurane). After approximately 5 min when breathing is slowed or there is no sign of respiration, quickly decapitate the mouse with sharp scissors. Spray the head with 70% ethanol and place in a tissue culture dish.\nUsing large blunt forceps hold head steady by grabbing the nose. Using medium sized dissection scissors, remove excess skin to reveal skull.\nMake cuts 1 and 2 by cutting the skull bilaterally, from posterior of the skull towards the front on each side, connecting the cut to the eye socket. Keep the tip of the scissors as close to the skull as possible to avoid tissue damage.\nFor cut 3, use small spring scissors to connect cuts 1 and 2. Then use the small blunt forceps to gently peel off the skull.\nUsing the small spring scissors, gently cut the remaining skull along the midline on top, such that the remaining skull becomes 2 halves (Figure 2, cut #4). Using forceps peel off the skull to reveal the two olfactory bulbs.",
    "Insert a flat-faced spatula (moistened with dissection buffer, so tissue won’t stick to it) in between bottom of the brain and base of skull, gently remove the brain and place into the dish containing dissection buffer on ice.\nRepeat step 6 to obtain a second brain for slicing\n7. Embedding the Brains in Agarose\nPlace two of the 35 mm2 dishes open on the ice and wipe down a pair of large blunt forceps with 70% ethanol.\nPour 3% low-melting point agarose (prepared in step 3) into the two dishes until a dome forms on top. Set timer for 3 min. At 3 mins (test by touching the rim of the agarose-filled dome, if polymerization of agarose can be observed, it’s ready) pick up one brain with blunt forceps and place into the side of an agarose-filled 35 mm dish, then move it to the center of the dish (this removes excess dissection buffer around the brain so it mounts better).\nRepeat for the 2nd brain. Start a timer for 10 min.\nAfter 10 min, insert a flat spatula into the space between agarose and dish to pop out the polymerized agarose containing the P6 brains.\nUse a flat razor blade to trim the agarose into a cube around the brain, making sure that the edges are as straight as possible.\nPlace superglue on the vibratome plate in two strips. Then, pick up the agarose mounted brain and gently drop it down over the glue, positioned for sagittal slices. Do the same for the other brain. Make sure both brains are lined up with one another.\nLet the glue dry at RT for 5-8 min. During this time, fill the ice holder area of the vibratome with crushed ice and water.\n8. Slicing with the Vibratome",
    "Place the cutting reservoir into the ice holder area, moving the tab to the right to lock it into place.\nUsing the circular head screw driver, pick up the circular vibratome plate with the brains glued on it, and fit it into the reservoir. Remove the screw driver and secure the plate in place with the hexagonal head screw driver. Make sure the plate and the cutting reservoir are firmly in place.\nUsing forceps, pickup the vibratome blade, fit it into the cutting head, lock in place with hexagonal screw driver. Then, secure the cutting head with the attached blade onto the vibratome using the round screw.\nBring up the position of the razor to as close to the agarose-embedded brains as possible, while making sure the razor is at the same height (or just above) the brains. Fill chamber with enough cold dissecting buffer to cover the blade.\nPress ↕ button once (you should see it blink, this button defines the boundaries when the blade will go back and forth), then press and hold “Forward” to manually cut the embedded brain, release until the razor clears the agarose block. Immediately press ↕ button again, this will define the end of the range for automatic cutting.\nPress the “SINGLE/CONT” button once and the light by CONT should go on. Set the cutting thickness to 400-450 µm, vibrating frequency to 5.5-6, and speed to 4. This will be the trimming setting.",
    "Press the “start/stop” button once, and automatic cutting should begin. Press “pause” to collect tissue using the spoon with holes, as needed. It should take about 5-10 min, to reach closer to midline. At this point, press “pause” and change the speed to 3 and change the thickness to 200 µm. Do not collect the first slice produced after making this change.\nThe desired slices of 200 µm thickness will have the olfactory bulb through the cerebellum nicely defined. Transfer each desired slice as they are cut into 6-well plates filled with dissection buffer on ice. Do this by moving the buffer in the slicing chamber around the tissue to float the slice, touching it as little as possible, lift it out of the buffer when it is squarely over the slotted spoon. Typically around 12 slices with the desired structures can be collected. The slices can be left in dissecting buffer on ice for up to 20 min.\nWhile slices are on ice, take out 6-well plate with inserts being coated with laminin from 37 °C incubator. In the dissection hood discard the laminin taking care not to damage the inserts. Add 3.5 ml of slice culture media to the top of each insert. The top of the media will form a dome-shape without spilling out into the wells.\n9. Plating the Slices onto the Inserts\nUsing the slotted spoon tool, place a brain slice into the media on the insert, gently pushing the slice to be fully submerged. Repeat for all slices.",
    "Use a p1000 to draw out 1 ml of slice culture media from the top of the insert and dispense it into the bottom of the well. Remove and discard the excess media until the edges of the agarose around the brain slicebecome visible. Do this for the remaining slices.\nPick up the insert by the rim with forceps, tilt and remove excess media. Then, quickly transfer the insert into 35 mm2 dish containing 1 ml of slice culture media. Use 2 pairs of sharp forceps to remove the agarose around the tissue, taking care not to stretch/damage slice or poke a hole in the membrane (easiest if you make a tear at the very edge of the agarose, then pull apart the agarose from either side). Then move the insert back to the 6-well plate and repeat for the remaining slices.\nIn a tissue culture hood with the blower off (to prevent slices from drying out) remove agarose fragments from each membrane.\nTransfer the slices to the 6-well plate prepared in step 5.1 and store the plate at 37 °C. Incubate slices for 24-48 hr.\n10. Changing the Slice Culture Media\nRepeat step 5.1 with a fresh 6-well plate.\nIn a tissue culture hood with the blower off, transfer the inserts to new 6-well plates containing fresh slice media.\n11. Plating Tumor Cells on the Slice\nSonicate the Cm-DiI dye and spin on medium speed for 2 min.\nSpin down tumor cells being used for the overlay at 201 x g for 5 min. Then resuspend in 2 ml of slice culture media.\nAdd 7 µl of Cm-DiI into the 2 ml of cells and media and incubate at 37 °C for 20 min.",
    "Spin down cells at 201 x g for 5min and resuspend in 200 µl of slicing media. Triturate gently to dissociate the cells (10-20 times or until pellet is gone) and then add 800 µl slicing media to make 1,000 µl total volume.\nCount viable tumor cells using Trypan blue. Add green fluorescent microspheres to tumor cells, at the same concentration as cells. These inert microspheres will serve as a control. Spin down the cell/microsphere mixture at 201 x g for 5 min and resuspend in desired amount of slice culture media. Plate cells at a density of 6,000 cells/slice in 65 µl volume. The number of cells plated per slice can be increased depending on preference and availability.\nIn the tissue culture hood dispense cells in 65 µl of media/slice onto the center of the slice.\n12. Imaging and Fixing\nNote: a Nikon Eclipse Ni C2si upright confocal was used to take a large image scan of the whole sagittal slice at 4X with red and green fluorescent channels. If scanning feature is not available, take multiple images sequentially across the slice and later stitch the images together in Photoshop (using the location of microspheres and the edge of the slice to navigate).\nThe next day (Day 1 imaging), transfer slices into six 35 mm2 dishes with 1 ml slice culture media. Image each slice one at a time on the fluorescent upright microscope. Take a large image scan of the whole sagittal slice at 4X with red and green fluorescent channels. Keep laser and gain settings the same for each slice. At the end of imaging, transfer all slices back to a 6-well plate containing fresh slice media.",
    "If addition of EDU, other proliferation marker or drug condition is desired, create a stock of slice media with the drug that will be used for the media changes daily for the treatment condition. The treatment condition should be introduced at step 12.1 (directly after Day 1 imaging). Any EDU or proliferation marker should be added to the media also beginning at 12.1 and refreshed daily (use EDU at 10 µM).\nImage again on Day 7 using the same settings as the Day 1 images.\nAfter Day 7 imaging is complete, move each slice into a 6-well plate with each well containing 1.2 ml of 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA). Carefully and slowly drop an additional 1 ml of PFA on top of each slice. Leave at RT for 1 hr.\nRemove PFA from each well and from the top of each slice. Wash each well 3x with PBS. Store the slices in PBS at 4 °C for staining or mounting on slides.\n\tNote: ImageJ settings may need to be adjusted and optimized to account for image and microscope quality as well as tumor cell size.\n13. Quantification of Images (Using ImageJ)\nNote: ImageJ settings may need to be adjusted and optimized to account for image and microscope quality as well as tumor cell size.\nIn ImageJ, use the polygon tool to outline the whole slice or the region that you want to quantify. Add this selection to the ROI manager where you can rename it and save it.\nRight click on the selected area and choose duplicate. Name this duplicate image with the region, slice, day. Press Ctl+Shift+E to show the outline, then select Process – subtract background – Rolling ball Radius = 4.",
    "After background subtraction, select “adjust threshold” in the “Image” dropdown menu. Check dark background – look at image zoomed in and set the threshold. As you set the threshold by moving the threshold bar, ensure all cells are included/highlighted but extremely small dots that are debris (or smaller than a cell) are not included. Use the same threshold for all images. Move the threshold window to the side.\nSelect “Process” – “Find Maxima” and set the noise tolerance between 5 and 10 and check the following: Preview point selection, output type as segmented particles, exclude edge maxima, above lower threshold. Then reselect the region of interest by pressing Ctl+Shift+E.\nSelect “Analyze Particles” from the Analyze drop down menu. Set the pixel size to 4-40 and the circularity to 0.00-1.00. Also click “show overlay outlines” “display results” and “summarize”, then press OK.\nRecord all raw data and the summary in a Microsoft office document. The “Count” for each region is needed to calculate fold change over the week in culture.\nRepeat this process for all images and areas of interest, making sure that the threshold and other settings remain consistent.\nCalculate the fold change in cell number on the slice during the week in culture by dividing the number of tumor cells on the slice on Day 7 by the number of cells on the slice on Day 1. Similarly, fold change in cell number within each region is calculated by dividing the number of cells in that region on Day 7 by the number of cells in that region on Day 1.",
    "Perform step 13.8 for microspheres as well. The microsphere number on the slice should be the same on Day 7 as on Day 1 (Fold change = 1). Similarly, microsphere number within each region should be the same on Day 7 as on Day 1 (Fold change =1). If Fold change differs from 1, this indicates changes in slice topography over time.\n14. Staining\nTape a piece of parafilm on the lab bench and draw six circles with a liquid blocker pap pen (one for each slice, just larger than the size of a slice). Place about 400 µl of PBS in a dot in the middle of each circle. Number or label the circles to identify each slice.\nIn 1 ml of PBS, use a razor blade to cut a square around the slice, leaving some space of membrane around the slice. Using forceps move the cut out slice into the first circle and carefully lay the slice on top of the bubble of PBS. It is essential to make sure that the slice does not fold over on itself or get flipped upside down during this process. Then, remove the PBS from underneath the slice and put it on top of the slice and add more PBS if needed to make sure it remains submerged. Repeat this step for each slice.\nMake 10 ml of 3% BSA in PBS. Take out 2 ml, and add 100 µl of digitonin to it. Mix and add to slices to block and permeabilize, 30 min at RT.\n\tNote: Use of other permeabilization agents such as Triton X-100 will result in loss of CM-DiI labeling.\nRemove permeabilization/blocking solution and rinse 3x with PBS for 10 min.",
    "If staining for EDU, follow the directions provided by the kit to assemble the mixture. Apply the mixture for 45 min. If staining with other antibodies, the protocol must be optimized for the concentration of primary and secondary antibodies (~1 hr RT for primary and secondary). Rinse 3x with PBS for 10 min.\nStain with DAPI 1:1,000 in PBS for 5 min RT. Rinse 2x with PBS.\n15. Mounting the Slices\nTransfer the slice to a microscope slide. Make sure the side of the membrane with the slice remains facing up, and does not fold over on itself. Draw a border around the slice with a liquid blocker pap pen.\nPlace a small glass coverslip (5 mm) on each side of the slice (to keep the slice from being damaged). Drop two or three drops of Fluoromount-G (for immunofluorescence) on top of the slice to just barely cover it. Then cover the slice long coverslip (24 x 50 mm).\nRepeat for each slice. Seal the edges of the slides with nail polish and store at 4 °C. Do confocal imaging of staining.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
