    "MT polymerizationDefrost one taxol aliquot at room temperature (RT) (10 µl of 10 mM taxol in DMSO) and mix it with 990 µl of BRB80 (BRB80-T) (final taxol concentration = 100 µM). Keep at RT.Defrost one tubulin aliquot (10 µl of 4 mg/ml tubulin) in an RT water bath until thawed. Immediately transfer aliquot to ice. Add 1 µl of BRB80 Cushion buffer to the tubulin aliquot and incubate for 20 min at 37 °C in a water bath to polymerize MTs. We advise to use a water bath for uniform heating of the sample.After incubation add 100 µl of BRB80-T to the MTs to stabilize them (final tubulin concentration = approx. 4 µM). Keep at RT from now on.MT binding assayNote: The assay relies on the fact that MTs, because of their large molecular weight, pellet when spun at 100,000 x g. If a protein of interest binds to MTs, it will thus also be found in the pellet. For the assay to provide reliable results, it is necessary that the test protein is stable under the conditions used during centrifugation (check various buffers if that is not the case). We recommend testing the stability of your protein by running a centrifugation of your protein in buffer solution without adding MTs. This test ascertains that the protein is not (or only negligibly) found in the pellet in absence of MTs (please also refer to Figure 1). In general, the salt concentration in the assay should be kept minimal as high salt concentrations interfere with MT binding. In our hands, the interaction between the MTs and the CC proteins was affected at NaCl concentrations above approx. 60 mM.Prepare 7 reactions as described in Table 1. BSA is used as a negative control as it does not bind to MTs.",
    "A mixture of different MT binding proteins (MAPF) serves as positive control. The concentration of the test protein should be high enough to add a minimum of 5 µg of protein to the assay. Fill up to a volume of 50 µl using BRB80-T. For practical guidelines on protein expression in E. coli, please refer to Sivashanmugam et al. (2009) and Rosano and Ceccarelli (2014).Table 1.

Mix gently by pipetting up and down without introducing air bubbles. If air bubbles are introduced, spin the buffer 30 sec at 10,000 x g.Prepare 7 ultracentrifuge tubes and add 100 µl of BRB80-CT to each tube. Again, avoid introducing air bubbles to the buffer.Place the reactions as outlined in Table 1 gently on top of the BRB80-CT without mixing the 2 solutions. By spinning the reactions through the cushion buffer, the separation of unbound MAPs from the microtubules is enhanced.Centrifuge for 30 min at 100,000 x g, 23 °C.After centrifuging, label the side of the tube facing away from the rotor centre with a pen. This is where the pellet should be found (the pellet may not be visible).Note that after centrifugation the phase separation between cushion and reaction is not visible anymore. Carefully remove 30 µl from the topmost part of the solution. This is the soluble fraction of unbound protein (see Figure 1). Do not discard it!Carefully remove and discard the rest of the solution using a pipette. Avoid touching the area marked previously to not disturb the MT pellet. Try not to leave any solution inside of the tube as this will dilute the pellet fraction.",
    "The pellet will be located at the tube side and not at the actual bottom of the tube.Add 60 µl 1x Laemmli buffer (Laemmli, 1970) directly to the pellet. Mix and resuspend by vortexing.Add 6 µl of 5x Laemmli buffer to the supernatant fraction. Mix by vortexing.Separate 10 µl of each fraction by SDS PAGE and stain the gels with colloidal Coomassie stain (Dyballa and Metzger, 2009) and image the gels. See Figure 1 for representative results.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160420/20160420072930_6422.jpgFigure 1. Representative data showing a MT binding assay. The test protein is the His-tagged, cytosolic domain of CC1 (CC1∆C223). A MAP fraction (MAPF) was used as the positive and BSA was used as the negative control, respectively. In comparison to the control without MTs (second last lane), CC1∆C223 was significantly enriched in the pellet fraction when MTs were present (last lane). The figure was taken from Endler et al. (2015).Dissociation constant (Kd) estimation of an MT binding protein by gel densitometryNote: For this assay one assumes that the underlying binding mechanism of the protein to MTs follows a one-to-one stoichiometry, i.e. one molecule of protein binds to one α-/β-tubulin subunit. If this is not the case for the protein of interest, the calculated ratio of protein bound to tubulin will eventually exceed 1:1 and the presented method is, in this case, not valid. Furthermore, the reliability of the assay depends on the MTs being stable throughout the whole experiment. If your protein shows depolymerizing or severing activity on MTs, this assay is also not appropriate (the more protein one adds, the more MTs will depolymerize or be severed, respectively).Polymerize MTs (as described in part A).Prepare 6 different dilutions of the test protein with the same buffer conditions, not exceeding a volume of 30 µl.",
    "For example, for dilutions with a total volume of V = 10 µl, use x µl of test protein and add 10-x µl of buffer to maintain a stable salt concentration over all dilutions. Note: If a volume of 20 µl is exceeded taxol may be added to a concentration of 100 µM to prevent MT depolymerisation.Replicate the sample with the highest protein concentration as a control.Prepare 8 reactions as described in Table 2. It is essential that the final assays have the same conditions (see step C2).Note: To estimate the Kd accurately, the reaction has to reach saturation, i.e., an increase in protein concentration does not lead to an increase in MT binding. Firstly, we recommend performing several spin down assays with variable concentrations of the test protein to find the point of saturation. After determination of the saturation point, it is important to collect enough data points below the saturation point to accurately fit the curve and calculate the Kd. It is good practice, to repeat the experiment (at least) 3 times to acquire enough data points for robust analysis.Table 2.
