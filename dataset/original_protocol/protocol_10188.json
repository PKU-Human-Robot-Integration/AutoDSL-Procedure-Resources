    "1. Preparing the Sample for Permeability Studies\nNOTE: In order to verify permeation measurements and simulations, a sample consisting of agarose gel or a cell matrix model based on cultivation of the skin model was used.\nAgarose gel\nDissolve 0.2 g of agarose high resolution powder in 10 mL of H2O (double-distilled water).\nMix the solution and heat it up to 80 °C. Maintain the temperature for 8 min.\nApply 28.6 µL agarose gel on the membrane of the 96-well membrane insert system (4.26 mm in diameter) or use 226 µL for the 12 well membrane insert system (12 mm in diameter) (e.g., Transwell system).\nWait 10 min until the gel is solidified.\nCollagen gel\n\tNOTE: All steps are performed under sterile conditions and the solutions are kept on ice to slow down the polymerization of the collagen gel.\n\t\nMix 125 µL of Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) with 1 mL of 0.4% collagen R solution (rat tail collagen).\nTitrate the solution with 1 M NaOH (sodium hydroxide) (~6 µL) until the color of phenol red changes from yellow to red.\nAdd 125 µL of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) + 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) to the collagen gel and mix carefully with a pipette tip.\nApply 28.6 µL of collagen gel to the membrane of the 96-well membrane insert system or 226 µL for the 12-well membrane insert system.\nLeave the gel in an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 30 min.\nCollagen cell model with fibroblast\n\tNOTE: All steps are executed under sterile conditions.\n\t\nPrepare primary fibroblasts 5-7 days before the experiment. Cultivate the fibroblasts with DMEM + 10% FCS in cell culture flasks (75 cm2) and change the medium every 2-3 days.\n\t\tNOTE: Depending on the experimental setup, a larger number of cells can be used.",
    "Remove the medium from the cell culture flask (80% confluent) and wash twice with 10 mL (culture flask 75 cm2) of phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Add 3 mL of 0.05% Trypsin/ ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and incubate for 3 min at 37 °C.\nTap gently on the culture flask to detach the cells from the surface. Stop the reaction by adding 3 mL of DMEM + 10% FCS. Transfer the solution into a centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 120 x g, remove the supernatant, and resuspend the cells with 0.5 mL of DMEM + 10% FCS.\nCount the cells and adjust to a concentration of 0.5 x 106 cells/mL.\n\t\tNOTE: The following steps are executed on ice to slow down the polymerization of the collagen gel.\nMix 125 µL of HBSS with 1 mL of 0.4% collagen R solution.\nTitrate the solution with 1 M NaOH (~ 6 µL) until the color of phenol red changes from yellow to red.\nAdd 125 µL of cell suspension (DMEM + 10% FCS + 0.5 x 106 cells/mL) into the collagen gel and mix carefully with a pipette.\nApply 28.6 µL of collagen gel on the membrane of the 96-well membrane insert system or 226 µL for the 12-well membrane insert system.\nLeave the gel in an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 30 min.\nApply 75 µL of DMEM + 10% FCS on the gel surface and 300 µL to the receiver plate of the 96-well membrane insert system. For the 12-well membrane insert system, use a volume of 590 µL for the surface and 1,846 µL for the receiver plate.",
    "Remove the medium from the surface of the cell matrix model (air lift) and incubate the cell matrix model further for 7 days. Use 100 μl medium on the bottom and change the medium every day.\nCollagen cell model with HaCaT\n\tNOTE: All steps are executed under sterile conditions.\n\t\nPrepare the HaCaT 5-7 days before the following steps. Cultivate the HaCaT with DMEM + 5% FCS in a cell culture flask (75 mm2) and change the medium every 2-3 days.\n\t\tNOTE: Depending on the experimental setup, a larger number of cells can be used.\nRemove the medium from the flask and wash twice with 10 mL (culture flask 75 cm2) of PBS. Add 3 mL of 0.05% Trypsin/EDTA and incubate for 10 min at 37 °C. Stop the reaction with 3 mL of DMEM + 10% FCS. Transfer the solution into a centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 120 x g, remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells with 0.5 mL of DMEM + 10% FCS.\nCount the cells and adjust to a concentration of 0.5 x 106 cells/mL.\n\t\tNOTE: The following steps are executed on ice to slow down the polymerization of the collagen gel.\nMix 125 µL of HBSS with 1 mL of 0.4% collagen R solution.\nTitrate the solution with 1 M NaOH (~ 6 µL) until the color of phenol red changes from yellow to red.\nAdd 125 µL of DMEM + 10% FCS to the collagen gel and mix it carefully with a pipette.\nApply 28.6 µL of cell suspension on the membrane of the 96-well membrane insert system or 226 µL for the 12-well membrane insert system.\nLeave the gel in an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 30 min.",
    "Apply 75 µL of cell suspension to the gel surface and add 300 µL of DMEM + 10% FCS to the receiver plate of the 96-well membrane insert system. For the 12-well membrane insert system, use a volume of 590 µL cell suspension for the surface and 1,846 µL of DMEM + 10% FCS for the receiver plate.\nIncubate the cell matrix model for 3 days; exchange the medium after 2 days.\nRemove the medium from the surface of the cell matrix model and incubate the cell matrix model for further 7 day. Use 100 µl medium on the bottom and change the medium every day.\nCollagen cell model with fibroblasts and HaCaT\n\tNOTE: All steps are executed under sterile conditions on ice to slow down the polymerization of the collagen gel. Prepare the fibroblasts as described in step 1.3 until step 1.3.5, and prepare a day later HaCaT as described in step 1.4 until step 1.4.4.\n\t\nMix 125 µL of HBSS in 1 mL of 0.4% collagen R solution.\nNeutralize the solution with 1 M NaOH (~6 µL) until the color of phenol red changes from yellow to a red violet.\nAdd 125 µL of primary fibroblast cell suspension consisting of DMEM + 10% FCS + 0.5 x 106 cells/mL to the collagen gel and mix carefully.\nApply 28.6 µL of cell suspension to the membrane of the 96-well membrane insert system or 226 µL for the 12-well membrane insert system.\nLeave the gel in an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 30 min.",
    "Next, apply 75 µL of DMEM + 10% FCS on the gel surface and 300 µL on to the receiver plate of the 96-well membrane insert system. For the 12-well membrane insert system, a volume of 590 µL is used for the surface and 1,846 µL for the receiver plate.\nIncubate for 1 day at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nRemove the medium from the surface and add a HaCaT cell suspension with 0.5 x 106 cells/mL. The volume is the same as described before under step 1.5.6.\nIncubate the cell matrix model for 3 days; exchange the medium after 2 days.\nRemove the medium from the surface of the cell matrix model and incubate the cell matrix model for further 7 day. Use 100 µl medium on the bottom and change the medium every day.\n\t\tNOTE: For this investigation, 3 gel/cell-model samples were prepared for the 12-well membrane insert system. For the 96-well membrane insert system, we used 6 samples for the gel/cell model. For statistical means, 3 samples are common. But for the experiments in the 96-well membrane insert system with collagen matrix model we expected failures and deviations for the cell culture. Therefore, we chose a larger number of samples.\n2. Permeability Studies in the Membrane Insert System\nDonor substance\n\tNOTE: Two fluorescein sodium salts (NaFl) are produced.\n\t\nDissolve NaFl in H2O at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL and 0.01 mg/mL. The different fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextranes (FD) with a molecular weight of 4,000, 10,000, 20,000, and 40,000 g/mol are dissolved in H2O at a concentration of 2 mg/mL. Use these solutions as donor substance for the permeability experiments (see Figure 1) with agarose gel.\nFor the setup with the collagen cell model, prepare all solutions with DMEM + 10% FCS instead of water.",
    "NOTE: Prepare stock solutions (10x higher concentration) of the donor substance. Small variations of the donor concentration can influence the results of the permeability experiment.\nExperimental method\n\tNOTE: The permeability experiment is executed at 37 °C and a humidity of > 90%. This parameter ensures the viability of the cells. Temperature influences the diffusion process so the same parameters are used for the experiments with the agarose gel, collagen gel, and collagen cell model. The volume information in the bracket refers to the 12-well membrane insert system.\n\t\nPrepare a 96- (or 12-) well membrane insert system with a barrier consisting of agarose gel (see Protocol 1.1) or cell model (see Protocol 1.2-1.5) and the fluorescence donor substance.\nPrepare dilutions of 1:10, 1:20, 1:40, 1:80, 1:160, and 1:320 of the donor substance for establishing a standard curve. Pipette 300 µL (1,846 µL) of every dilution in three wells of the receiver plate. For the 12-well membrane insert system use a separate receiver plate. The serial dilutions are used to convert the measured fluorescence [RFU] into the equivalent concentration [mg/mL].\nAdd 75 µL (590 µL) of donor substance on top of the sample (agarose gel or cell model) and 300 µL (1,846 µL) of acceptor substance (H2O or DMEM + 10% FCS) in the receiver plate (see Figure 1).\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure that the surfaces of the liquid in the membrane insert system and in the receiver plate have the same level to avoid hydrostatic pressure.\nTransfer the entire system onto a shaker in the incubator. Adjust the shaking to achieve homogenous mixing (total stroke orbit is 1.5 mm, speed is adjusted at level 3.5, which is related to a rotation of ~ 480 1/min) to avoid a concentration gradient, which influences the diffusion process.",
    "Determine fluorescence periodically every hour. To measure the fluorescence, transfer the membrane insert system into an empty plate and measure the fluorescence within the receiver using a plate reader. Use an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and emission of 535 nm for fluorescein.\nRun the experiment for 5 h.\n\t\tNOTE: During the experiments, the liquid evaporates from the entire system. The evaporation changes the concentration in the donor and acceptor and influences the results. This effect is neglected in the case of a running time of 5 h, but for longer running times it should be considered.\nCalculating the permeability coefficient\nTo establish the standard curve, plot the fluorescence of the serial dilutions versus concentration and perform a linear regression over the data.\nUse the slope of the linear regression to convert the fluorescence data of the permeation experiment into concentration. For the purpose of the simulation, convert units into mol/m3.\nPlot the concentration as a function over time and establish the linear segment of the data (see Figure 2).\nDetermine the slope of this linear part and calculate the permeability coefficient according to the following equation (see the example in Figure 2):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56412/56412eq1.jpg\n\t\twhere dcA/ dt is the change of the concentration of the substance within the acceptor side over time (the slope); CD is the concentration on the donor side; P is the permeability coefficient; A is the permeation surface, and VA is the volume of the acceptor. This equation is derived from Fick's First Law and can only be applied when CD » CA6,22.\nNOTE: The concentrations in the donor have to be much higher than the concentration detected in the acceptor. This was verified in the experimental setup.\n3. Simulation",
    "NOTE: The simulation was done with COMSOL Multiphysics 5.1. A basic knowledge of this is assumed. For the diffusion simulation, the following assumptions are made: (a) the diffusion coefficient of the substances in H2O is much higher in comparison to that in the gel. To compensate for this difference, the simulation uses a value of 1 x 10-9 m2/s which is higher by a factor of 10 to 100 compared to the diffusion coefficient of NaFl through 2% agarose gel. (b) in the experiment, the substance diffuses through the barrier and then through the membrane of the membrane insert system. In contrast to the experimental setup, the virtual agarose gel or cell matrix and membrane are considered to be one homogenous phase. (c) boundary effects on walls are set to \"no slip\", all slipping effect on walls (not between liquid and gel or liquid and cell model) of the membrane insert system are neglected and are not significant for the diffusion process.\nSetup of the diffusion simulation\n\tNOTE: These steps demonstrate the setup of the simulation of the permeability experiment. The simulations for the 96- and 12-well membrane insert systems were set up separately. The \"Chemical Species Transport\" module uses an equation based on Fick's second law of diffusion:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56412/56412eq9.jpg\n\twhere c is the concentration of the substance, t is the time, u is the velocity, D is the diffusion coefficient, and R is the reaction rate. The reaction rate was neglected because no chemical reaction occurred in the diffusion process.\n\t\nOpen the program and start a new model. Chose the \"Model Wizard\", select the 3D model, add \"Transport of Diluted Species\" to physics interface in the pull-down menu, click on \"Study\", select the \"Time Dependent\" study, and click on \"Done\".",
    "Go to the \"Global Definitions\" and add \"Parameters\" with right click.

In Step 3.2, an example is shown of how to build the geometry of the 96-well membrane insert system. The unit of length is set to meter.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not build the whole geometry to save calculation time.

    "NOTE: \"Initial Values 1\" is used for barrier and acceptor domain. In the next step, the donor domain will be overwritten.\nAdd a second \"Initial Values 2\" with right click on \"Transport of Diluted Species\" and select the donor (3) as the domain. Set the concentration as the initial concentration of the donor substance (e.g., C_fl from Table 2).\nAdd \"Symmetry 1\" with right click on \"Transport of Diluted Species\", add and choose all surfaces of the \"Boundary Selection,\" which mirror the whole geometry (for the geometry example in step 3.2, it is the boundary number 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8).\n\t\tNOTE: This point can be neglected if the whole geometry was set up.\nWith a right click on \"Mesh\" add two \"Free Tetrahedral\". Select the barrier (2) as the domain (change the Geometric entity level into \"Domain\"). Add \"Size\" with right click on \"Free Tetrahedral 1\" and for the predefined mesh \"Finer\" for the 12-well membrane insert system or \"extra Fine\" for a 96-well membrane insert system.\nIn the second \"Free Tetrahedral\" select the acceptor and donor as domain and the predefined mesh \"Normal\" for a 12-well membrane insert system or \"Finer\" for a 96-well membrane insert system (see Figure 3c and Figure 3d).\n\t\tNOTE: It is also possible to choose a coarser mesh to save computation time. This might reduce the accuracy of the results.
