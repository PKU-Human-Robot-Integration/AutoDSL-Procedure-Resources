Multiple mice can be combined for large preparation.\nTransfer glands to a petri dish and mince them into ∼1 mm3 pieces using sterile blade.\nTransfer the minced glands to a new 15 mL tube by resuspending them with 5 mL of Gland Digestion Buffer I (see section ‘materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]’) per mouse.\nPlace the digestion mixture on a nutator in a 37°C incubator for 1.5 - 2 h.\nFor Tumor digestion\nHarvest the tumor (∼1 cm in diameter) and wash with 10 mL ice-cold PBS in a 15 mL tube.\nMince the tumor into ∼ 1 mm3 pieces using a sterile blade.\nTransfer the minced tumor fragments to a new 15 mL tube by resuspending them with 5 mL Tumor Digestion Buffer I (see section ‘materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]’).\nPlace the digestion mixture on a nutator in a 37°C incubator for 2 h.\nAfter digestion is complete, add 5 mL PBS to each 15 mL tube with digested tissue to reduce the viscosity of the digested tissue mixture.\nPipette the tissue mixture up and down for 20 times.\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C–8°C.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant (fatty top layer and liquid layer). Do not disturb the cell pellet.\nRed blood cell (RBC) lysis.",
    "For mammary epithelial cell isolation: this step is optional. If yield is important, perform red blood cell lysis. For each mouse, add 1 mL RBC lysis, resuspend cell pellet, and place tube on ice for 1 min. After 1 min, pipet the cell mixture up and down gently for 5–6 times, add 10 mL PBS to the tube and spin down at 500 × g for 5 min. If yield is not an issue (like in large preps), resuspend the pellet with 10 mL PBS by pipetting, pulse spin at 1,000 × g for 1 min. remove the supernatant containing red blood cells.\nFor tumor organoid cell isolation: perform RBC lysis as above.\nResuspend cell pellets in 1 mL 0.05% trypsin-EDTA, place the tube at 37°C for 5 min, mixing occasionally by shaking.\nAfter 5 min, pipet the cell mixture to dissociate clumps.\nAdd 10 mL basic medium II (see section ‘materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]’) to stop the digestion and centrifuge at 700 × g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant.\nResuspend cell pellets with 1 mL Digestion Buffer II (see section ‘materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]’) by pipetting and incubate for 5 min at 37°C with occasional mixing by shaking.\nAfter 5 min, pipet the cell mixture to dissociate clumps.\nTo stop the digestion, add 10 mL PBS and centrifuge at 700 × g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant.\nResuspend with 3 mL Suspension Buffer (see section ‘materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]’).\nNote: EDTA helps quench dispase and prevent aggregation.\nFilter through 40 μm cell strainers to get single cells (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/689-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Isolation of mouse mammary epithelial cells from normal mammary glands or tumors\nCell counting:\nMix 0.1 mL cell suspension with 0.1 mL 0.4% trypan blue. The volume of cell suspension can be reduced to 20 μl if needed.",
    "Count the live cell number by Hemocytometer. Live cells will not take up trypan blue.\nCritical: All spins should be done in the refrigerated centrifuge at 4°C–8°C.\nEstablishing MaSC/tumor organoids from freshly isolated cells\nTiming: 1 week\nBefore proceeding with the plating, wash cells with organoid culture medium.\nPellet down the cell suspension by centrifuging the tube at 700 × g for 5 min.\nResuspend the pellet\nFreshly prepare the ice-cold organoid culture medium with 5% Matrigel (see section ‘materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]’; For tumor organoid and normal basal stem cell organoid culture, use MaSC/tumor organoid culture medium I; For luminal progenitor organoid culture, use MaSC organoid culture medium II)\nResuspend the cell pellet in ice-cold organoid culture medium (containing 5% Matrigel, see section ‘Materials and Equipment’) at a final concentration of 150,000 cells per 1 mL of organoid culture medium. For one well of poly-HEMA coated 6-well plates (see section ‘before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]’), seed 300,000 cells with 2 mL culture medium.\nPut the plate in the humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2 for organoid culture.\nReplace the medium every 3 days.\nCheck the organoid growth under a light microscope. After 4–6 days, organoids (> 100 μm in diameter) should form.\nCritical: All spins should be done in the refrigerated centrifuge at 4°C–8°C.\nPassaging MaSC/tumor organoid culture\nTiming: 1 week or experiment dependent\nOrganoids can be passaged once reaching 100–200 μm in diameter (∼ 7-day culture from freshly isolated cells). Prepare all the solutions and equipment before the experiment. Thaw Matrigel on ice.\nCollect organoids into 15 mL tube containing 10 mL ice-cold PBS by pipetting the Matrigel layer containing organoids.\nMix and centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min.",
    "Digest the organoids with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (1 mL per well) for 5–10 min at 37°C. Gently pipette up and down in between.\nAdd 10 mL Basic medium II (see section ‘materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]’) to stop digestion.\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min.\nRemove supernatant without disturbing the pellet and resuspend the cell pellet in 3 mL Basic medium II (see section ‘materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]’) and do cell counting.\nDepending on the different aims of the experiment, seed the cells using organoid culture medium (see section ‘materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]’) at different cell densities. For passage the cells, seed 300,000 cells with 2 mL organoid medium per well for 6-well plates. For quantifying organoid-forming efficiency, seed 200–500 cells per well in 96-well plates.\nCritical: All spins should be done in the refrigerated centrifuge at 4°C–8°C. Refresh the medium every 3–4 days.\nNote: Organoid cultures from freshly isolated cells are usually ready for passage after 1 week. They can then be passaged every 4–6 days at a 1:4 ratio for expansion. The exact timing for passaging organoid cultures is determined by the growth rate of the organoids. We usually passage the culture when the majority of organoids are between 100–200 μm in diameter.\nNote: Pipetting organoids after Trypsin treatment will result in a single-cell suspension. However, some cell clumps might still remain, which can be filtered out with a 40 μm cell strainer.\nMaking frozen stocks of MaSC/tumor organoids\nTiming: 30 min\nPrepare Freezing medium (see section ‘materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]’) and cryovials before the experiment.\nDissociate the organoids into single cells based on steps 11–15.\nResuspend the cell pellet with 3 mL of Freezing medium (for the cell pellet from one well of 6-well plate).",

Cool down the agarose at 22°C–25°C for 5 min.\nGently mix the organoids from step 30 with 100 μL of 2% agarose solution.\nCritical: Cut off the end of a P200 pipette tip and use it to pipette the agarose. Bubbles need to be avoided during pipetting.\nGently place the organoids/agarose mixture into the agarose-coated cryomold using a cut P200 tip. Make sure to put the mixture in the middle of the cryomold.\nReturn the cryomold to the ice for 10–20 min until the gel is completely solidified.\nGently and carefully remove the solidified agarose containing the embedded organoids from the mold and transfer it into a tissue cassette for further processing.\nProceed with the paraffin embedding process following the standard FFPE embedding protocol.\nCut the section at 4–6 μm thickness using a microtome.\nFor OCT-embedding sample preparation\nAfter step 30, add 1 mL 30% sucrose solution to the organoid pellet and place at 4°C overnight (12–16 h) to allow organoids to sink into sucrose solution.\nRemove the sucrose as much as possible.\nPlace a few drops of OCT onto the center of the bottom of cryomold.\nAdd ∼300 μl (around 3 drops) of OCT to the organoid pellet. Gently mix and transfer the OCT/organoid mixture into the OCT drop in the cryomold using a cut 200 μL pipette tip.\nCritical: Bubbles need to be avoided. If air bubbles occur in the tissue mold, remove them with a pipette tip.\nCarefully drop more OCT onto the specimen until it is completely covered. Avoid any bubbles inside the OCT.",
