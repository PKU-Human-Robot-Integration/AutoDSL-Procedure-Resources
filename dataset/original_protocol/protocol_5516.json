    "As shown in Figure 4A, stand up the platform for instillation on the bench.   Anesthetize mice with 50 to 75 μl of ketamine/xylazine mixture by s.c. injection into the back.   As shown in Figure 4B, hang anesthetized mice on the platform by their incisors.   Take 50 μl of prepared alum suspension into an injector for instillation. In general, 50 μl of suspension (containing 50-100 μg of alum or 50-500 μg other particulates you want to inject, such as silica or nickel oxide) is the maximum volume for injection into the lungs.   As shown in Figure 4C, use a spatula as a tongue depressor and insert injector into the throat, check the trachea (in order to find the trachea easily, put out mouse’s tongue using spatula and injector, first). It is difficult to check the trachea when young mice are used for the experiment. Because aged male mice are bigger, they are easier to find the trachea especially for training. Then, slowly drop suspensions of alum toward trachea. Dropped suspensions are aspirated into the lungs by breathing (aspiration method).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171115/20171115193745_6384.jpg Figure 4. Administration into the lungs    Intranasal administration (i.n.) is also effective for administration into the lung. As shown in Figure 5, hold anesthetized mice and drop 30 μl (15 μl in each nostril) of suspensions of particulates into the nose. Dropped suspensions are also aspirated by breathing. In general, it is known that i.n. administration of 30 μl of solution reaches the lung.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171115/20171115193850_2800.jpg Figure 5.
