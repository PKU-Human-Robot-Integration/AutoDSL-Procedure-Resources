Immerse the straw for 1 minute in 30-35°C water.\n6C. Release the contents on a dry dish and immediately locate the embryo under a dissection microscope.",
    "7C. Transfer the embryo to pre-warmed 0.5 M Sucrose Thawing Medium at 37°C and incubate for 5 min. \n8C. Transfer the embryo to pre-warmed 0.2 M Sucrose Thawing Medium at 37°C and incubate for 10 min. \n9C. Wash the embryo carefully through 7 drops of pre-warmed Freeze/Thaw Diluent Solution at 37 °C.\n10C. Transfer the embryo to a drop of pre-equilibrated complete human embryo culture medium under mineral oil. \n11C. Culture the embryo in a drop of pre-equilibrated complete human embryo culture medium for a minimum of two hours before removing the _zona pellucida_. This allows the embryo to recover from the thawing procedure. \n**Culture of human embryos through pre- to post-implantation _in vitro_**\nNOTE: This protocol starts when the human embryos reach the blastocyst stage \\(day 6 of development).\n12. A day before plating human embryos for pre- to post-implantation culture, place complete human embryo culture medium in a 21% O<sub>2</sub> / 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37°C to equilibrate over night. \n  13. On the day of the experiment \\(_in vitro_ culture day 0), prepare IVC1 and equilibrate it in 21% O<sub>2</sub> / 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37°C for a minimum of 1 hr.\n  Then, pipette 300 μL of the pre-equilibrated IVC1 per well of an ibiTreat 8-well μ-plate. Add 300 μL of sterile PBS in each well that will not be used for embryo culture. \n14. Place Acidic Tyrode’s solution at 37°C for a minimum of 15 min. Next, prepare a dish with a few 40 μL drops of pre-warmed Acidic Tyrode’s solution and a few 40 μL drops of pre-equilibrated complete human embryo culture medium \\(to wash out the Acidic Tyrode’s solution after removal of _zona pellucida_).",
    "15. Use an EZ Squeeze pipette to place an embryo in the first Acidic Tyrode’s solution drop. To aid in the dissolution of the _zona pellucida_ move the embryo to the next drop of Acidic Tyrode’s solution until the _zona pellucida_ has dissolved. Immediately after, transfer the embryo to the human embryo culture medium drop and wash off the Acidic Tyrode’s solution by moving the embryo through a few culture medium drops. \n  CRITICAL STEP: Minimize the culture medium content while embryos are transferred into the Acidic Tyrode’s drops, as the buffers present in the culture medium neutralize the Acidic Tyrode’s solution. Observe the embryo under the dissection microscope at all times, to minimise the exposure time to Acidic Tyrode’s solution. Keep the Acidic Tyrode’s solution warm \\(ideally at 37°C), as the efficiency of this reagent decreases at lower temperatures. \n16. Transfer the _zona pellucida_-free embryo into a well of the ibiTreat 8-well μ-plate containing the pre-equilibrated IVC1 and immediately place the slide in a 21% O<sub>2</sub> / 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37°C. \n  17. On the _in vitro_ culture day 2 \\(about 48h after plating), prepare IVC2 and place it in a 21% O<sub>2</sub> / 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37°C to equilibrate for a minimum of 1 hour.\n  18. Carefully remove 150 μL of medium from the well using a sterile pipette tip and add 200 μL of pre-equilibrated IVC2. Immediately place the slide in 21% O<sub>2</sub> / 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37°C.\n  CRITICAL STEP: Embryos typically adhere on ibiTreat 8-well μ-plate during _in vitro_ culture day 2 or 3. Therefore, it is important to observe the embryo during the first medium change.\n19. From _in vitro_ culture day 3 until the culture is terminated, change medium every day by removing 150 μL and adding 200 μL of pre-equilibrated IVC2 medium.",
    "CAUTION: Following internationally recognised guidelines, cultures must be stopped on day 14 of development or prior to any signs of primitive streak<sup>7</sup>. \n**Human embryo immunofluorescence**\n20. Wash the embryos once with PBS. \n  21. Fix the embryos by incubating them in fixative solution at room temperature for 20 min. \n  22. Wash the embryos three times with washing solution at room temperature for 10 min. \n  23. Permeabilise the embryos by incubating them in permeabilisation solution at room temperature for 20 min. \n  24. Wash the embryos three times in washing solution at room temperature, for 10 min each. \n  25. Incubate the embryos in blocking solution at room temperature for 4 to 6 hrs or at 4°C over night.\n  26. Incubate the embryos with primary antibodies diluted 1:200 in blocking solution at 4°C over night.\n  NOTE: Different antibodies may require alternative fixation method, dilutions and/or incubation times. \n27. Wash the embryos three times in washing solution at room temperature for 10 min. \n  28. Incubate the embryos with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies and DAPI diluted 1:500 in blocking solution at room temperature for 2-4 hours or at 4°C over night. \n  29. Wash the embryos two times in washing solution at room temperature for 10 min.\n  \n**Part 2: hPSC 3D organoid culture**\nNOTE: Culture hPSCs following standard conditions as previously described<sup>8,9</sup>. E8 or mTESR1 medium may be used to generate 3D hPSC cultures, as applicable. \n1. Prior to starting the experiment, place filter tips and ibiTreat 8-well μ-plates in the refrigerator and thaw matrigel slowly on ice.\n  2. Detach hPSCs using StemPro Accutase by incubating at 37°C for 3 min.\n  3. Add E8 or mTESR1 and pipette the cell suspension in a 15 ml conical tube. Centrifuge for 3 minutes at 1000 rpm.",
    "4. Wash once with PBS and centrifuge the cell suspension for 3 minutes at 1000 rpm. Re-suspend the cells in either E8 or mTESR1.\n  NOTE: At this point, ROCK inhibitor may be added to prevent dissociation-induced cell death \\(optional).\n5. Count the cells using a hemacytometer. 2.5 ×10<sup>4</sup> cells are needed per well. \n  6. Coat the entire surface of the pre-chilled ibiTreat 8-well μ-plate with 40 μL of ice-cold matrigel. \n  CRITICAL STEP: Use pre-chilled tips and keep the matrigel on ice at all times. Increasing temperatures lead to premature polymerisation. Make sure the matrigel covers the entire surface of the well. \n7. Place on a 37 °C incubator for 2 minutes or until the matrigel has solidified. Immediately after, add 2.5 ×10<sup>4</sup> cells in a final volume of 250 μL per well \\(cell suspension prepared in 5). \n  8. Incubate the cell suspension for 5 minutes at 37°C or until most of the cells have attached to the matrigel. \n  9. Gently remove the supernatant and add fresh E8 or mTESR1 medium, supplemented with 5% matrigel. \n  NOTE: At this point, ROCK inhibitor may be added to prevent dissociation-induced cell death \\(optional) for 24 hours. \n10. Analyse lumen formation 24 or 48 hours after plating."
