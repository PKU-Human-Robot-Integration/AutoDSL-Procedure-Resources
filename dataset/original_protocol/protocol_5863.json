A typical TevCas9 target site is illustrated in Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180814/20180814194255_5983.jpgFigure 2. Illustration of TevCas9 target site with predicted deletion size Select four target sites from the list of predicted sites for the P. trincornutum urease gene. Order an oligonucleotide corresponding to the predicted gRNA binding site (underlined sequence in Table 1), and the complementary oligonucleotide. Design the oligonucleotides with top strand 5’-TCGA-3’ and bottom strand 3’-CAAA-5’ BsaI restriction cut site overhangs to facilitate cloning into the Cas9 and TevCas9 vectors (Table 1). Table 1.

Prepare a 50 μl gRNA phosphorylation reaction (Table 2) in a 0.2 ml PCR tube. Place the reaction in a thermocycler and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min and then denature at 95 °C for 5 min. Next, slowly cool to 50 °C at a rate of -1 °C min-1 to allow annealing of gRNA top and bottom strands. Table 2.

Overview of screening procedure for P. tricornutum urease knockouts. pKSconj diaCas9 or pKSconj diaTevCas9 plasmid is delivered to P. tricornutum by E. coli. Screen the exconjugants with T7EI assay. Isolate sub-clones from exconjugants and perform phenotypic screen by plating sub-clones onto urea and nitrate plates. Verify the deletion length by Sanger Sequencing.After 14 days, randomly select ten P. tricornutum exconjugants and streak them onto an L1 + ZeocinTM plate and grow for 7 days.Scrape 50% of the cells from one streak and place it into 3 ml of L1 media with 50 μg ml-1 ZeocinTM. Suspend the other 50% of cells in 100 μl TE (pH 8.0) buffer, flash freeze at -80 °C for 15 min, and heat lyse at 95 °C for 5 min. Use the lysed P. tricornutum exconjugant cells as the template for PCR amplification of the gRNA target site using AmpliTaq DNA polymerase. Design the PCR so the product will be ~500 bp using primers located ~250 bp upstream and downstream of the gRNA target site. Analyze the PCR products on a 1% agarose gel to confirm the size and presence of the PCR product. Denature the PCR product at 95 °C for 5 min and slowly cool to 50 °C and then freeze the sample at -20 °C for 2 min to generate heteroduplexes of edited and unedited target sites.Use the PCR product as the substrate for a T7EI assay (Table 5). Incubate the reaction at 37 °C for 15 min and analyze the digested product on a 1% agarose gel.",

P. tricornutum colonies were resuspended in TE (pH 8.0) buffer followed by flash freezing at -80 °C for 15 min followed by cell lysis at 95 °C for 12 min. The urease gene target site was PCR amplified. PCR product was denatured at 95 °C and cooled down to 50 °C to allow random reannealing. T7E1 assay was performed using the randomly annealed PCR product as template and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with T7EI and NEB 2 buffer. Products were loaded onto a 1% agarose gel at 100 V for 40 min. Asterisks (*) denote colonies positive for editing.
