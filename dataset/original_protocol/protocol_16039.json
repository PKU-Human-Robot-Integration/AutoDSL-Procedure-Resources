    "This protocol describes the methodology used to capture chromosome conformation before proximity ligation. Cells grown in appropriate medium are cross-linked sequentially with formaldehyde and disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG). Formaldehyde reacts with amino and imino groups of both protein and DNA, and can efficiently produce cross-links within a 2-Å radius, making it suitable for capturing proximal interactions (reviewed in Hoffman, Frey, Smith, & Auble, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.198#cpz1198-bib-0009]). On the other hand, the NHS-esters in DSG react with the primary amines on proteins and can capture amine-amine interactions within 8 Å (Strang, Cushman, DeRubeis, Peterson, & Pfaffinger, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.198#cpz1198-bib-0020]). Using the combination of DSG and formaldehyde has been demonstrated to better preserve chromatin contacts and increase data quality at various resolutions when compared to the use of formaldehyde alone (Akgol Oksuz et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.198#cpz1198-bib-0001]; Hsieh et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.198#cpz1198-bib-0010]). After cross-linking, cells are typically snap-frozen for storage at −80°C. However, we have noticed that using freshly fixed cells may enhance data quality. This is likely due to the freezing and thawing of samples.\nMaterials\nCells growing in appropriate growth medium\nHBSS (Gibco, cat. no. 14025-092)\nDPBS (Gibco, cat. no. 14190-144)\n37% formaldehyde (Fisher, cat. no.

    "1a. The day before the experiment, seed cells in 150-mm plates in appropriate medium to have 5 × 106 cells per plate for harvest the next day, and incubate overnight.\n2a. Aspirate medium from the plate and wash twice with ∼10 ml HBSS.\n3a. Immediately before cross-linking, prepare a 1% formaldehyde cross-linking solution in a 50-ml tube by combining 22.5 ml HBSS and 625 µl of 37% formaldehyde. Mix well.\n4a. Pour the 1% formaldehyde solution (∼23.125 ml) into each 150-mm plate.\n5a. Incubate exactly 10 min at room temperature, gently rocking the plates by hand every 2 min.\n6a. To quench the cross-linking reaction, add 1.25 ml of 2.5 M glycine (to 128 mM final) and mix well by gently swirling the plate.\n7a. Incubate the plates 5 min at room temperature, and then place on ice for at least 15 min to stop the cross-linking completely.\n8a. Scrape the cells from the plates with a cell scraper.\nCell clumps will be observed.\n9a. Using a pipet, transfer the cell suspension to a 50-ml conical tube and centrifuge 10 min at 1000 × g, room temperature.\n10a. Wash the cell pellet once with 10 ml DPBS, pipetting to resuspend, and centrifuge 10 min at 1000 × g, room temperature. Aspirate and discard the supernatant. Proceed immediately to DSG cross-linking (step 11).\nBe careful when aspirating the supernatant, as the cell pellet may be loose.\nStarting from cells in suspension\nCross-linking with formaldehyde\n1b. The day before the experiment, seed enough cells in a 175-cm2 flask in appropriate medium to have 5 × 106 cells per flask at harvest, and incubate overnight.\nCells can be grown in different size flask or plates, but users should ensure that cells are actively growing.",
    "2b. Immediately before harvest, count cells with a hemocytometer and transfer 5 × 106 cells to a 50-ml conical tube.\n3b. Gently pellet the cells by centrifuging 10 min at 300 × g, room temperature.\n4b. Prepare a 1% formaldehyde cross-linking solution by quickly adding 1.25 ml of 37% formaldehyde to 45 ml HBSS, and immediately mix by inverting the tube several times.\n5b. Resuspend the cell pellet completely using the 1% formaldehyde cross-linking solution prepared in step 4b (∼46.25 ml) by pipetting up and down.\n6b. Incubate exactly 10 min at room temperature on a rotator.\nAlternatively, gentle manual inversion of the tube every 1-2 min or a rocking platform can be used instead of a rotator.\n7b. Quench the cross-linking reaction by adding 2.5 ml of 2.5 M glycine (final concentration of 128 mM) in one shot. Mix well by inverting the tube.\n8b. Incubate 5 min at room temperature and then incubate at least 15 min on ice to stop the cross-linking completely.\n9b. Centrifuge the cross-linked cells 10 min at 1000 × g, room temperature.

    "14. Centrifuge cells 15 min at 2000 × g, room temperature, and remove supernatant.\nBe careful when removing the supernatant at this point, as cells are loosely pelleted\n15. Resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of 0.05% BSA-DPBS and transfer to a 1.7-ml tube.\nThe addition of BSA helps reduce cell clumping.\n16. Centrifuge cells 15 min at 2000 × g, 4°C, and then remove supernatant completely.\nRemove supernatant completely and quickly to avoid loosening the pellet.\n17. Snap-freeze in liquid nitrogen, and either store the pellet at −80°C or continue immediately to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.198#cpz1198-prot-0002].",
    "This protocol describes the steps that follow cross-linking of cells up until DNA purification of proximity-ligated chromatin fragments. Cross-linked cells obtained in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.198#cpz1198-prot-0001] are first lysed and mechanically disrupted before being subjected to restriction enzyme digestion. The use of both DpnII and DdeI restriction enzymes yields a fragment length distribution that allows high-quality data analysis of genomic structures, ranging from loops to chromosome domains. The filled-in overhangs are then ligated to fragments that are in close 3D proximity. After reversal of cross-linking, DNA is purified using a protocol adapted from Moore & Dowhan (2002[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.198#cpz1198-bib-0016]) and the resulting sample is treated with RNase. Quality control of the conformation capture process marks the final step of this protocol. Here, the quality of the input chromatin is assessed, as well as the extent to which chromatin is restriction-digested and ligated. Using gel electrophoresis, both controls are compared to the proximity-ligated material (Hi-C sample). Purified proximity-ligated samples can then be stored at −20°C before continuing with Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.198#cpz1198-prot-0003].\nMaterials\nCell pellets (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.198#cpz1198-prot-0001])\nLysis buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.198#cpz1198-rec-0003])\n10× NEBuffer 3.1 (New England Biolabs, cat. no.

Dounce homogenize the cells on ice with pestle A (the large-clearance pestle). Slowly move the pestle up and down 30 times, incubate on ice 1 min to allow cells to cool down, and then continue with another 30 strokes.\n3. Transfer the lysate to a 1.7-ml microcentrifuge tube.\nSome cell types tend to stick in the pipet tip, so keep the suspension moving.\n4. Centrifuge the lysed suspension 5 min at 2500 × g, room temperature.\n5. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the wet pellet by vortexing.",
    "Make sure the supernatant is removed as much as possible. Flicking or vortexing a wet pellet should create a yogurt-like substance with minimal clumps.\n6. Resuspended the pellet in 500 µl ice-cold 1× NEBuffer 3.1 and centrifuge 5 min at 2500 × g, room temperature.\n7. Repeat step 6 for a second wash.\n8. Resuspend pellet in 1× NEBuffer 3.1 to a final volume of 360 µl by pipetting.\nNote that a certain volume of buffer will be carried over along with the pellet. Make sure to add the correct amount of buffer (∼340 µl) to attain a final volume of 360 µl.\n9. Save 18 µl of each lysate for “CHROMATIN INTEGRITY CONTROL” (CI) and store these at 4°C.\n10. Add 38 µl of 1% SDS to each Hi-C sample (380 µl total sample volume) and mix carefully by pipetting to avoid making bubbles.\n11. Incubate samples in Thermomixer for exactly 10 min at 65°C without shaking, to open up chromatin.\n12. Immediately place tubes on ice and add 43 µl of 10% Triton X-100 to each Hi-C sample (423 µl total sample volume) to quench the SDS. Gently mix by pipetting, avoiding making bubbles.\n13. Add 40 µl of 10 U/µl DdeI, 8 µl of 50 U/µl DpnII, and 4 µl of 1× NEBuffer 3.1 (475 µl total sample volume) and carefully mix by pipetting.\n14. Digest the chromatin overnight (∼16 hr) at 37°C in a Thermomixer with interval shaking (900 rpm, 30 s on, 4 min off).\nBiotinylation of DNA ends\n15. After the overnight restriction enzyme digestion is complete, incubate the Hi-C samples 20 min at 65°C to deactivate the endonuclease enzymes.\n16.

After incubation (step 15), place the Hi-C samples immediately on ice.\n18. Transfer 10 µl from each Hi-C sample to a 1.7-ml microcentrifuge tube, label it as the “DIGESTION CONTROL” (DC) for that sample, and store at 4°C.\n19. Briefly spin down the tubes to remove condensation from the lid. Add 70 µl of the biotin fill-in mix (step 16) to each Hi-C sample (535 µl total sample volume), and mix gently by pipetting without making bubbles.\n20.

Incubate the Hi-C samples 4 hr at 16°C in a Thermomixer with interval shaking (900 rpm, 30 s on, 4 min off).\nChromatin has now been covalently captured, and the Hi-C samples can be stored at 4°C for a few days.\nReversal of cross-linking\n24. Bring the volumes of both the CI and DC samples (stored at 4°C in steps 9 and 18, respectively) to 50 µl each with TLE.",
    "25. To each CI and DC sample, add 10 µl of 10 mg/ml proteinase K and incubate overnight at 65°C with interval shaking (900 rpm, 30 s on, 4 min off). Then keep at room temperature.\nAlternatively, as it is only necessary to reverse-cross-link control samples for 30 min, this step can be executed between incubations at the DNA purification step (see next section).\n26. To each Hi-C sample (from step 23), add 50 µl of 10 mg/ml proteinase K and incubate 2 hr at 65°C with interval shaking (900 rpm, 30 s on, 4 min off).\n27. Add another 50 µl of 10 mg/ml proteinase K to each Hi-C sample and continue incubating overnight at 65°C.\nDNA purification\n28. Remove the Hi-C samples from 65°C and allow tubes to reach room temperature.\n29. Transfer each sample to an individual 15-ml conical tube and add 2 vol (2.6 ml) phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol to each.\n30. Vortex each Hi-C sample for 1 min and then slowly pour contents into a 15-ml phase-lock tube.\n31. Centrifuge the Hi-C samples in 15-ml tubes for 5 min at 1500-3500 × g in a benchtop centrifuge.\nUnless otherwise indicated, all centrifugation steps are performed at room temperature.\n32. Carefully pour the aqueous phase from each Hi-C sample into a 35-ml Beckman round-bottom ultracentrifuge tube and bring to a total volume of 1250 µl with Milli-Q water.\n33. Add 1/10 vol (125 µl) 3 M sodium acetate to each sample and mix well by inversion.\n34. Add 2.5 vol (3.4 ml) ice-cold 100% ethanol and mix well by inversion.\n35. Incubate the Hi-C samples ∼15 min on dry ice (to avoid sample solidification).\n36. Centrifuge 30 min at 18,000 × g, 4°C.",
    "Mark the bottom of the tubes to indicate where the pellet should be. This will facilitate visualization of the pellet and elution of DNA.\n37. Remove supernatant completely and discard.\n38. Air-dry the Hi-C samples for ∼10 min or until visibly dry.\n39. Solubilize each pellet in 450 µl TLE and transfer to an Amicon Ultra-0.5 Centrifugal Filter Unit.\n40. Centrifuge Amicon columns 10 min at 14,000 × g (maximum speed) in a microcentrifuge and discard flowthrough.\n41. Flush each Beckman tube with another 450 µl TLE and transfer to its respective Amicon column for washing.\nWashing the Amicon columns with the flushed TLE will increase DNA yield.\n42. Centrifuge Amicon columns 10 min at 14,000 × g (maximum speed) in a microcentrifuge and discard flowthrough.\n43. Wash each column with 450 µl TLE, centrifuging at 14,000 × g (maximum speed) and discarding the flowthrough.\n44. Add 80 µl TLE to the column, flip column into a fresh collection tube, and centrifuge 2 min at 14,000 × g (maximum speed) in a microcentrifuge.\nTaking the dead volume into account, the final volume of the sample should be ∼100 µl.\n45. Add 1 µl of 1 mg/ml RNase A (a 10-fold dilution of 10 mg/ml stock) to each Hi-C sample and incubate at least 20 min at 37°C on a heat block, water bath, or Thermomixer.\n46. Remove the samples from 37°C and store at 4°C until needed for quality control step.\nQuality control of chromatin integrity, digestion, and proximity ligation\n47.

For gel quantification, a standard curve can be generated using markers at a range of known concentrations (five lanes at left) that are loaded alongside the chromatin integrity (CI), digestion control (DC), and proximity-ligated (Hi-C) samples. A successful proximity ligation reaction is observed by the increase in overall molecular weight in the proximity-ligated samples from its corresponding DC.\n53. Quantify DNA by densitometry from the gel directly or by using other methods such as Qubit or Nanodrop.",

    "This protocol describes how to transform the ligation products generated in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.198#cpz1198-prot-0002] into a format suitable for Illumina sequencing. Before ligation junctions can be selected, biotin must be removed from unligated ends (see discussion of partial digests in Background Information). Because Illumina sequencing platforms require libraries to have a specific fragment size range for optimal cluster formation, Hi-C samples must be fragmented by sonication and further size-selected using AMPure XP beads. DNA damage induced by sonication is then repaired, and sequencing adapters are ligated to freshly A-tailed ends. We provide here methodology for the generation and ligation of indexed Illumina TruSeq adapters. We have also successfully generated Hi-C libraries through ligation of Illumina PE adapters, and should note that other methods could potentially be used to ligate adapters compatible with Illumina sequencing. Once adapters are ligated, a PCR titration is performed to assess the optimal number of cycles needed to attain enough material for sequencing while minimizing PCR duplicates. Final library amplification is performed using this optimized number of PCR cycles. Samples are then purified, and primer dimers are removed using AMPure XP beads, yielding a library that is ready for sequencing.\nMaterials\nHi-C DNA samples from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.198#cpz1198-prot-0002] (step 46)\n10× NEBuffer 2.1 (New England Biolabs, cat. no.

Proceed immediately to sonication, or store samples at 4°C (days to weeks) or −20°C (long term).\nSonication\n5. Pool the split samples from step 4 (130 µl total sample volume) and transfer to a Covaris sonication tube.\n6. Sonicate samples on either on a Covaris E220 evolution or a Covaris M220 using the following parameters, to achieve a fragment size distribution <500 bp:\n         \ntable:\n﻿Parameter,Covaris M220,Covaris E220 evolution\nPeak incident power (W),50 W,175 W\nDuty cycle/duty factor,20%,10%\nIntensity,–,5\nCycles per burst,200,200\nTreatment time (s),180,180\nNote that different types of sonicators can be used, but parameters will need to be optimized to obtain a narrow fragment distribution <500 bp.\nSize selection\n7. Transfer sonicated samples from the Covaris tubes into a 1.7-ml LoBind microcentrifuge tube and label them UF (“Upper Fraction”).\n8. Bring each sample to a total volume of 500 µl with TLE.\nMake sure that the volume is exactly 500 µl, as the ratio of sample-to-AMPure XP bead mix is essential for size selection.\n9. Add 400 µl of AMPure XP mixture to each tube to attain a 0.8× ratio of AMPure volume to sample volume.\nUnder these conditions, the beads will bind fragments >300 bp and the supernatant will contain the remaining fragments <300 bp.\n10. Mix tubes by vortexing and incubate 10 min at room temperature on the rotator.\nThe second mode on the Argos rotator “erratically” rotates samples to vigorously mix, and this mode is applied throughout all size-selection incubations.\n11. Place the tubes on a magnetic particle separator (MPS) for 5 min at room temperature.",
    "12. During this incubation, prepare fresh 1.7-µl tubes for each sample. Add 500 µl AMPure beads to each one and label them LF (“Lower Fraction”).\nThese tubes will be used to restrict the lower boundary of the fragments to >100 bp, using a ratio of AMPure XP beads to sample of 1.1×.\n13. Incubate tubes from step 12 on MPS for 5 min.\n14. Discard the supernatant from the tubes in step 13 and resuspend the captured beads in 150 µl AMPure XP beads.\nThis step increases the number of beads within a small volume (i.e., 150 µl) of AMPure XP mixture, which prevents saturation of the beads with DNA.\n15. Collect the supernatant from step 11 (<300 bp) and transfer to the corresponding tube prepared to select the Lower Fraction (step 14).\n150 µl AMPure XP beads + 400 µl AMPure bead buffer from the 0.8 × selection)/500 µl of initial sample = 1.1×.\n16. Vortex the Lower Fraction tubes to mix and incubate 10 min at room temperature on the rotator.\nUnder these conditions, beads bind DNA fragments >100 bp, resulting in a library with a fragment size range of 100-300 bp within the Lower Fraction tube.\n17. After incubation, place the Lower Fraction tubes on the MPS for 5 min at room temperature.\n18. Discard the supernatant from the Lower Fraction tubes and spin tubes down briefly using a microcentrifuge.\n19. Wash the beads from both Upper and Lower Fractions twice with 200 µl of 70% ethanol, capturing beads against the MPS for 5 min each time.\nThere is no need to resuspend beads here.\n20. Completely remove ethanol and air dry the beads on the MPS.\nDry until alcohol is completely evaporated and the pellet looks less shiny. This usually takes up to 10 min.",
    "21. Resuspend both fractions in 50 µl TLE buffer and incubate 10 min at room temperature on the bench, flicking to mix every 2 min to elute the DNA.\n22. Capture beads from both fractions on the MPS for 5 min.\n23. Transfer supernatant from each sample to a fresh 1.7-ml LoBind tube.\nSamples can be stored for a few days at 4°C or long term at −20°C.\n24. Run samples on a 2% agarose/TBE gel as described below to assess the quality and to quantify size-selected samples. A typical gel can be found in Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.198#cpz1198-fig-0003].\n         \ntable:\n﻿Sample,Contents\n1-kb ladder (50 ng/µl),500 ng (10 µl)\n,250 ng (5 µl)\n,100 ng (2 µl)\n,50 ng (1 µl)\nUpper Fraction,7 µl sample + 3 µl water + 2 µl 6× Orange G dye\nLower Fraction,3 µl sample + 7 µl water + 2 µl 6× Orange G dye\nLower Fraction,1 µl Hi-C library + 9 µl water + 2 µl 6× Orange G dye.\nBecause Covaris sonicators generate highly reproducible fragment size distributions, experienced Hi-C users can skip running this gel and proceed immediately to end repair. Also note that although the Lower Fraction is the only sample carried over in downstream steps, we advise users to retain the Upper Fractions until after titration PCR of the final library. If there is not enough library to produce a detectable PCR product after PCR titration (step 72), libraries can be constructed from material in the Upper Fraction to increase library concentration and rescue the sample.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9c13459b-c27e-4fd3-a58d-0fde6eb06fee/cpz1198-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nAgarose gel showing typical post-size-selection results with Upper and Lower Fractions for four different Hi-C samples.\n25.

Because ClaI does not digest DpnII-DdeI junctions, this step is less informative when digesting with both DpnII and DdeI than it was in previous Hi-C protocols that employ only DpnII.
