    "1. Prepare the Alginate Solution, the CaCO3 Suspension and the Acidified Oil\nPrepare the process buffer and medium.\nPrepare the typical process buffer used to generate high-concentration alginate beads using 10 mM HEPES, 170 mM NaCl. Adjust the pH to 7.4.\nPrepare the typical culture medium using Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 6 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin.\nPrepare the alginate stock solution at 1.17 fold the final desired concentration in the beads.\nFirst, weigh the appropriate amount of alginate powder. For example, to obtain a final concentration of 5% alginate with 50:50 LVM and MVG alginate, weigh out a total of 1.17 g sodium alginate by combining 0.583 g LVM alginate powder and 0.583 g MVG alginate powder.\nPlace 20 mL process buffer into an autoclavable glass jar on a magnetic stir plate and agitate at ~200 rpm. Progressively add the sodium alginate powder to the solution.\nLeave the solution stirring overnight at a low speed. If necessary, fasten the flask to the stir plate.\nIf the solution is incompletely dissolved, fasten the bottle onto a rotary mixer and continue mixing at 37 °C for an additional 24 h.\nSterilize the alginate solution by autoclaving the solution for 30 min in a vessel that is less than half full. Allow the temperature to decrease below 60 °C before retrieving the solution.\nIf necessary, remove particles by filtering the alginate solution shortly after autoclaving before it reaches room temperature, while the viscosity remains sufficiently low.\nPrepare the calcium carbonate suspension at 21-fold the final desired concentration for internal gelation.\nWeigh out the CaCO3 powder. For example, add 1 g CaCO3 to 20 mL process buffer to obtain 24 mM CaCO3 as the final gelling agent concentration.",
    "Autoclave the CaCO3 suspension for 30 min.\n\t\tNOTE: The CaCO3 concentration will change over time due to the bicarbonate - CO2 equilibrium. Avoid using the same stock CaCO3 suspension for more than 10 encapsulation procedures.\nAutoclave the stirred vessel used for the emulsification process. Prior to use, remove any traces of condensed water remaining in the spinner flask.\nImmediately before the emulsification process, prepare the acidified oil. Dissolve 44 µL acetic acid per 11 mL mineral oil placed in a 50 mL conical tube.\n\tNOTE: A common mistake is incomplete dissolution of the acetic acid. Avoid pipetting small amounts of acetic acid and ensure that the acetic acid is completely dissolved in oil by repeated vortexing.\n\tCAUTION: acetic acid is a toxic and volatile acid. Handle this reagent under a fume hood and keep the acetic acid/oil solution in a closed container until the emulsification step. Refer to the MSDS information on this reagent for further information.\nAllow all the solutions to reach room temperature before proceeding to cell encapsulation.\n2. Alginate Bead Generation by Emulsification and Internal Gelation\nPlace 10 mL light mineral oil in the spinner flask and start agitation at a low rotation speed (e.g. 250 rpm for the spinner flask used in this video).\nIf the cells used for the process are from adherent cultures, apply trypsin to suspend the cells. End the reaction by adding FBS-containing medium or trypsin inhibitor and collect a sample for cell enumeration.\nDetermine the cell concentration and viability after Trypan blue staining using a hemocytometer or an automated cell counter, as previously described32.",
    "Centrifuge the cells for 7 min at 300 x g and wash them once in the desired medium for cell immobilization. Ensure that this medium contains emulsifiers such as either FBS or bovine serum albumin (BSA). For example, use DMEM containing 10% FBS.\nRe-suspend the cell pellet in the same medium to obtain 10.5-fold the desired final concentration in the beads.\nAdd 1.1 mL of the 10.5-fold concentrated cell stock to 9.9 mL of the alginate solution. Then, add 550 µL of CaCO3 suspension and mix by stirring with a sterile spatula to ensure an even distribution of the CaCO3.\nImmediately transfer 10.5 mL of the alginate, cell and CaCO3 mixture into the agitating oil using a syringe.\n\tNOTE: For highly viscous solutions, aspirate and eject the mixture very slowly to avoid air bubbles. In some cases, it is preferable to stop the agitation while adding the mixture to the flask to avoid alginate entrainment onto the impeller shaft.\nImmediately after adding the alginate, cell and CaCO3 mixture to the oil, increase the agitation rate.\n\tNOTE: For the 5% LVM:MVG alginate used here, a rotation speed of 1025 rpm was applied to generate beads of approximately 900 µm diameter suitable for in vitro culture35. Higher rotation speeds and lower alginate concentrations will lead to lower average bead diameters, as described in previous publications25,32. Slight changes in impeller and vessel geometry, as well as alginate properties can greatly affect the average bead diameter. For each change in vessel configuration or alginate lot, a standard curve relating the surface area moment average bead diameter to the rotation speed should be generated32.\nStart the timer and emulsify the alginate for 12 min.",
    "Add 10 mL of the oil and acetic acid solution to acidify the emulsion, dissolve the CaCO3 and hence physically cross-link the alginate into gelled beads. Allow 8 min for this acidification step.\n3. Bead Recovery\nReduce the agitation rate to 400 rpm. Add 40 mL of process buffer mixed with 10% medium to increase the pH and to cause phase inversion.\nStop the agitation 1 min later and transfer the mixture to 50 mL centrifuge tubes. Rinse the spinner flask with an additional 20 mL medium and add this to the tube. Aspirate as much aqueous phase as possible from the spinner flask before aspirating the oil phase to minimize bead contact with the oil phase.\n\tNOTE: Use a large-bore pipette (e.g. 25 mL pipette) at this step and from this point on to avoid damaging the beads. For smaller volumes, the bead suspension can also be manipulated with cut pipette tips. To obtain such tips, cut the end of the pipette tip with scissors while wearing eye protection.\nCentrifuge the tubes for 3 min at 630 x g to accelerate bead settling and phase separation.\nRemove the oil and excess aqueous solution by aspirating with a Pasteur pipette.\nWash the beads at least once with medium. Filter the bead suspension on 40 µm nylon cell strainers, and aspirate excess liquid associated with the beads from below the strainer. Transfer the beads into a known volume of medium using a sterile spatula.\n\tNOTE: Smaller or larger pore size filters can be used at this step, depending on the target minimum bead diameter. However, gravity filtration is recommended rather than pressure-driven filtration through sub-micron pore size filters to avoid damaging the beads.",
    "Measure the bead volume by volume displacement (volume after adding the beads, minus the volume prior to adding the beads) and top up the medium to obtain the desired bead:total volume ratio, which is typically 1:5, or 1 mL beads in 4 mL medium. From this point on, always use large bore pipettes to avoid damaging the beads.\nTransfer the encapsulated cells into T-flasks for in vitro culture or transplantation experiments.\n4. Quality Control and Applications\nNOTE: In order to ensure encapsulated cell and bead quality, the bead size distribution and cell survival after the process should be quantified. Reversing the gel to recover the cells from within the beads for further analysis is commonly performed.\nTo assess the bead size distribution, stain the beads with toluidine blue-O.\nPlace 0.5 mL beads into 4 mL process buffer containing 10% complete medium.\nAdd 500 µL of a 1 g/L toluidine blue solution prepared in process buffer.\nIncubate for 60 min in a conical tube on a rotary shaker at 50 rpm.\nAdd 5 mL process buffer containing 10% complete medium and immediately transfer the beads and solution into a Petri dish and acquire images on a low-magnification microscope or using a hand-held digital camera. If needed, place the Petri dish on a light box before acquiring images with a hand-held camera to enhance the contrast and avoid shadows.\nPerform image analysis to quantify the bead size distribution as previously described32, for example using image analysis freeware36.\nTo assess cell survival qualitatively, stain the cells using ethidium homodimer to identify dead cells and calcein AM to identify live cells.\nAdd 1 volume of beads to 4 volumes of process buffer containing 10% complete medium.",
    "Add the appropriate amount of calcein AM and ethidium homodimer stock solutions to obtain 4 µM and 2 µM concentrations, respectively. Generate single stain controls by adding only one of the reagents to some bead samples.\nIncubate the beads on ice for 20 min.\nPlace the solution between a slide and coverslip using a spacer such as an o-ring to avoid compressing the beads.\nProceed to fluorescence microscopy. Use the single stain controls to assess fluorescence bleed-through. Select appropriate fluorescence filters based on the excitation/emission wavelengths associated with calcein AM (494/517 nm) and ethidium homodimer bound to DNA (528/617 nm).\nTo recover the cells from the beads for further analysis, degel the alginate using citrate or another chelating solution.\nPrepare a degelling solution containing 55 mM citrate, 10 mM HEPES and 95 mM NaCl at pH 7.4.\nMix this solution with 10% medium, and then add 1 mL alginate beads to 9 mL of the mixture.\nDegel the beads on ice with 75 rpm agitation for 20 min.\n\t\tNOTE: The cells can now be used for analysis or removed from the degelled alginate solution by centrifugation. For example, cell viability after degelling can be quantified by Trypan Blue staining. Alternatively, the cells can be centrifuged and washed, followed by mRNA, DNA and/or protein sampling and analysis.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
