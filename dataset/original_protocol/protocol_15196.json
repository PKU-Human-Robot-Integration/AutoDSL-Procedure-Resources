    "1. Preparing Mice for Imaging\nPrior to the imaging study, anesthetize the dam (2-3% isoflurane) in the induction chamber. Remove the animal from the induction chamber and immediately place the snout within a nose cone connected to the anesthesia system. Remove fur from the mid chest level to lower limbs (See Figure 1) with hair clippers. Remove the remaining body hair with depilatory cream. Depilatory cream may also be used without hair clippers, and should be thoroughly rinsed off of the skin after use to prevent irritation.\nPlace the anesthetized mouse in a supine position on a heating pad with embedded ECG leads in order to maintain body temperature (Figure 1). Apply electrode gel to the four paws and tape them to the ECG electrodes.\nObtain a steady-state sedation level throughout the procedure (1.0% to 1.5% isoflurane mixed with 100% O2). The level of anesthesia can be adjusted to maintain a target heart rate of 450 ± 50 beats per min (bpm). Careful attention should be paid to minimize dosage of isoflurane and duration of sedation to less than one hour.\nGently insert a rectal probe (after lubricating) to monitor body temperature via the heating pad. It is important to maintain the body temperature within a narrow range (37.0 °C ± 0.5 °C). Controlled anesthetic and constant body temperature is essential for hemodynamic stability of the mother and fetuses.\nTechnical Considerations",
    "The acquisition of fetal echocardiograms can be challenging. Data obtained from these studies can confounded due to the response to stress from both the dam and the fetus. Ideally, the animal temperature should be maintained using a heated imaging platform, circulating warming pad, heating lamps, or autoregulated heating blankets. In addition, routine use of a warmed acoustic gel is recommended. Although the predominant concern regarding body temperature control is to avoid hypothermia, development of hyperthermia should be of equal concern. An unmonitored heating apparatus such as a simple heating pad or the presence of close proximity to halogen illumination can result in fast and dangerous elevation of body temperature. Since substantial body temperature fluctuations in either direction places the animal at risk, every attempt should be made to maintain normal body temperatures.\nThe sonographer acquiring the images needs to avoid placing excessive pressure on the cavity with the transducer, since the weight of the transducer alone may result in altered cardiac function. The duration of image acquisition must also be kept to a minimum (ideally less than one hour) in order to reduce the physiologic and hemodynamic changes resulting from prolonged sedation. Additionally, length of time and exposure to isoflurane for each study must be kept to a minimum due to potential teratogenic effects of isoflurane 12.\n2. Identification of Embryos\nImaging is started using the mother's bladder as a landmark, with fetuses on the left and right uterine horns labeled as L1, 2,3, et cetera (left side) and R1, 2,3, et cetera (right side) (see Figure 1C). Notation of fetus location is useful for retrieval of specimens after imaging.",
    "Specimens situated too deep in the abdomen are scanned to document their presence but are excluded from data analysis because of poor resolution. The ability to scan adjacent embryos may help in tracking fetuses (Figure 2A).\nScan planes are modified by changing the orientation of the mouse with respect to the scan plane. Images are obtained in 2 orthogonal planes for each fetus (Figure 2). An effort is made to obtain views approximating the transverse, frontal, or sagittal planes but sometimes is limited to oblique planes by the position of the uterus in the abdomen. Rotation of the scanning head will also allow for modification of orientation without moving the dam.\nTechnical Considerations\nWhile handheld operation of the probe is feasible in adult mouse echocardiography, handheld operation in fetal imaging in not recommended. Identification of fetuses is complicated by the variable nature of uterine location, tortuosity, and movement. To minimize difficulties with fetus localization, stationary transducer use (Figure 1) with minimal movement beyond the horizontal plane of the dam is essential.\n3. Evaluation of Structure and Function\nScanning b-mode images are used to identify basic cardiac structures such as the atria, interventricular septum, ventricular chambers, and left and right outflow tracts (Figure 2).\nM-mode images are obtained from the short axis view and are used to measure ventricular wall thickness and chamber dimensions (Figure 3). If correct alignment is not obtainable due to fetal lie, measurements from b-mode images can be used to quantify % fractional shortening (FS). Temporal changes between LV end-systolic dimension (LVESD) and LV end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD) throughout the cardiac cycle are used for the calculation of shortening fraction (FS), as follows:\n\t%FS = [(LVEDD - LVESD) / LVEDD] x 100",
    "The left and right ventricles are identified by scanning from head to tail. Left and right sides should be annotated. Visible flow streams generated by echogenic fetal blood facilitates accurate placement of the Doppler sample volume within the mitral orifice. Left ventricular inflow velocity is obtained from the mitral valves in apical four-chamber and LV long axis views (Figure 4,C). Aortic outflow measurements can be used to measure systolic ejection time (Figure 4,D). Heart rate may be calculated from the measurement of one flow cycle to the following flow cycle (Figure 4, C and D). Care should be taken to align blood flow and the Doppler beam to minimize the Doppler angle. Values taken beyond an angle of 60 degrees are inaccurate and should be avoided.\nScanning b-mode images are used to identify common structural congenital abnormalities such as ventricular septal defects (Figure 5). Doppler sample volume within the ventricles may be used to identify flow across the ventricular septum. Additional parameters that are easily monitored include fetal size, heart rates, flow velocities, pericardial effusions, and fetal hydrops. The definitive diagnosis of specific cardiac defects requires additional evaluation by necropsy and histopathology.\nTechnical Considerations",
    "Identification of left and right chambers can be difficult in fetal cardiac imaging due to the similar dimensions of ventricular chambers during development. One strategy is to establish right and left fetal orientation in real time by moving the imaging platform in the horizontal plane. Identification of snout, limb buds, and spine will help identify the let/right orientation of the fetus. If possible, tracking of the outflow track to the arch or the visualization of the main bifurcation of the pulmonary artery will allow for identification of the left ventricular outflow tract or right outflow tract respectively. For each fetus studied, it is important to note the determined left-right orientation on saved images.\n \nPost-imaging Animal Monitoring and Care\n \nFollowing the completion of imaging, the dam is returned to the appropriate housing and monitored according to standard institutional post-procedure protocol. Analgesia following this imaging procedure is not required. Full resumption of normal activity can be anticipated within five minutes.\n4. Representative Results of Fetal Echocardiography",
    "The development of high frequency probes (above 8 MHz), have allowed commercial echocardiographic equipment to have an axial resolution of approximately 0.2 mm with a lateral resolution of 0.3 mm when the image is zoomed and acquired at a depth of 1 cm. Most of the recently developed transducers are linear which have the advantage of avoiding near field artifacts. High frequency (30-50 MHz) mechanical probes have been recently developed which are adequate for the murine chest and heart rate, allowing an axial resolution of approximately 50 μm at a depth of 5-12 mm. Most recently, these high frequency mechanical probes have added color Doppler capabilities enabling a complete evaluation of ventricular and valvular function and identification of shunt lesions in the fetal heart. The methods described here are performed on a VisualSonics Vevo 770 system and can be applied to nearly all equivalent systems. Current commercially available ultra-high frequency ultrasound system can operate at 40 Hz with maximal imaging depth of 7 to 14 mm, with up to 60 mm lateral and 50 to 100 mm axial resolution (Vevo770, VisualSonics, Inc.). This compares with 60 Hz and 20 mm imaging depth, with 50 to 100 mm axial and 200 to 500 mm lateral resolution with the clinical Acuson Sequoia ultrasound system.\nGiven the small size of the fetal mouse heart, fetal echocardiography studies in mice are technically challenging. Unlike echocardiography in adult mice, the sonographer must use nonconventional ultrasound imaging planes defined by the fetus' body axes. Tortuosity of the uterus also affects the orientation of the fetus and must be taken into consideration. Additionally, the inherent limitation in penetration depth of ultra-high frequency ultrasound can make it difficult to image all specimens in pregnancies with a large number of fetuses.",
    "An ultrasound imaging strategy allows for high throughput screening for congenital cardiovascular and extracardiac defects 7. Beyond the study of genetic alterations, this technique may be used to screen for defects in pharmacologic and toxicology studies. This methodology can also be used as a guidance tool for interventional procedures such as injections or measurement of ventricular pressures 13.\nThe noninvasive nature of the fetal ultrasound is advantageous, not only because it allows cardiovascular function to be assessed under physiological conditions, but also because this provides critical phenotypic information in real time. Longitudinal examination of embryonic hearts, though technically possible, remains challenging for several reasons. Serial examination of the same fetus and identification of the same fetus at each exam is challenging in the absence of an evident structural defect. Movement of the uterus and the fetus may completely change the orientation of the specimen and thus make longitudinal tracking and follow-up measurements difficult 14.\nThough echocardiography is a powerful technique for identification of cardiac abnormalities, the specific diagnosis of structural heart defects requires further detailed phenotyping by necropsy and histopathology 15. Correlation of genotype and a specific fetus requires harvesting fetuses by hysterotomy, preferably immediately after an echo study and while the dam is still anesthetized to minimize changes in orientation and embryo location.\nNormal values for chamber dimensions and function have been reported for embryonic mice and users of this technique are advised to review the references cited for these values 6-10. Assessment of valvular morphology is limited by image resolution; however, annular dimension measurements and velocity measurements through the major vessels is feasible even as early as ED 9.5. Care must be taken to obtain adequate alignment with blood flow and the transducer 10, 16.",
    "It should be emphasized that cardiac dimensions vary according to mice strains, gender and age, and rapidly change at different embryonic time points and heart rates. It is important to verify that groups of mice are matched for these parameters. Fetal imaging varies by mouse strain as well. For example, the pregnant CD-1 dam routinely contains more embryos compared to the C57/BL6 strain and thus may be more difficult to visualize all specimens. For these reasons, use of age and strain matched controls for each experiment should be used instead of reference values. In addition, measurements of individual parameters such as left ventricular end-diastolic dimension and posterior wall thickness may vary in normal mice up to 25% 8.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4416/4416fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.
