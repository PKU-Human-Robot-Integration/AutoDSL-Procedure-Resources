    "Cell labelingPlate 1 x 104-2 x 104 log-phase growing cells in 300 µl growth medium for each well of an eight-chamber glass microscope slide on the day before the experiment, such that the cells are 50-60% confluent the day of cell labeling. We typically use adherent cells, for e.g. HAP-1 cells that grow in IMDM medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Note: We have not used this procedure with suspension cells. However, in principle it should be possible to use suspension cells as they can be treated with EdU in solution, deposited on microscopic slides using a cytospin, and then fixed to proceed with the assay.  The next day, gently aspirate growth medium from wells and add 200 μl pre-warmed growth medium containing EdU (125 μM). Incubate the slide at 37 °C in a tissue culture incubator for 8 min before fixation. This condition allows to detect proteins at unperturbed newly replicated DNA, ‘E only’.Note: Equilibrate growth media to 37 °C prior to treating cells to ensure uninterrupted replication of cells during treatments. Be quick with washes and treatments, so as to limit exposure to room temperature that may disturb replication.  (Optional) For replication stalling conditions, aspirate the EdU-media after 8 min, wash wells swiftly but gently twice with PBS, aspirate and add growth medium containing hydroxyurea (HU) or any replication stalling agent of choice for a desired amount of time, typically 1-5 h at 37 °C. This condition allows detection of proteins at stalled forks, ‘E-HU’. Note: We typically use 200 μM or 4 mM HU for replication stalling conditions. Lower concentrations of HU represent a transient fork stalling condition while high concentrations can cause DNA breakage (Roy et al, 2018b).",
    "One hour HU treatment would enable visualization of early replication stalling events, while 4 h HU (or longer) treatment enables visualization of later events.  (Optional) The EdU treatment (Step A2) is chased with thymidine. This allows to differentiate proteins bound to newly synthesized DNA from proteins associated with ongoing DNA replication forks; Proteins that travel with the DNA replication fork will have moved on during incubations with thymidine and will no longer be in proximity to the original EdU label, which makes the PLA reaction unproductive. For a thymidine chase, aspirate the EdU-containing media after 8 min, wash wells twice with PBS and add back growth medium containing thymidine (100 μM). Incubate slides at 37 °C for 4 h. This condition allows detection of proteins that are bound to replicated DNA and not progressing with the active replication fork, ‘E-Thy’. Similarly, the absence of a signal under this condition combined with the presence of a signal under the “E only” condition defines proteins traveling with ongoing DNA replication forks. Always include a well with no EdU treatments as a negative control, ‘No EdU’. The EdU-EdU SIRF (see notes) serves as a positive control. Note: It is advisable to perform all the conditions including the optional ones, to distinguish between proteins at a regular unperturbed replication fork (E only), versus at stalled replication forks (E-HU) or a chromatin bound protein that is in close proximity to a replication fork (E-Thy). The E-Thy condition distinguishes between proteins bound DNA itself from proteins bound to active replication forks.Cell fixationGently aspirate growth medium, and carefully add 200 μl of fixation solution to each well (2% PFA diluted in PBS [pH 7.4]). Incubate at room temperature (RT) for 15 min without disturbing the slide. Fixation time may vary depending on cell type.",
    "Note: Handle PFA with caution inside a biochemical safety cabinet. Discard PFA waste according to institutional biosafety guidelines. After fixation, discard of PFA and wash wells with PBS (pH 7.4) twice for 5 min. Dis-assemble chambers from chamber slide (Figure 2), ensuring that the wells do not dry out during disassembly and carefully place slides in Coplin jar containing 60 ml PBS. Note: Fixed slides can be stored at 4 °C for up to one week. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190916/20190916232918_4453.jpgFigure 2. Slide chamber dis-assembly. A.

Cell permeabilizationPermeabilize cells by placing slides in Coplin jar containing 60 ml permeabilization solution (0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 15 min at RT.Wash slides in Coplin jar with PBS (pH 7.4) twice for 5 min each. Click-iT reactionPrepare humid slide chamber by placing wet kimwipes inside a slide box at RT and equilibrate for 5 min (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190916/20190916232939_4153.jpgFigure 3. Humid slide chamber. Preparation of humid slide chamber by placing folded paper wipes (Kimwipes) wetted with distilled water at the bottom of a slide box. Slides are laid flat, facing up during antibody and PLA solution incubations and are covered with plastic cover slips during respective incubations.Prepare fresh click-iT reaction cocktail by combining 2 mM copper sulfate, 10 μM biotin-azide and 100 mM sodium ascorbate in PBS in said order and mix well by vortexing. Notes:Make 1 M sodium ascorbate fresh, prior to use. Limit light exposure to biotin azide aliquots. A mixture of Alexa 488 azide and biotin azide (1:10, total 10 μM) can be used instead of biotin azide alone, during click reaction.",
    "This enables normalization of PLA signal to the EdU signal and determination of the cell-cycle phase, such as early, mid and late S-phase (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190916/20190916233035_7270.jpgFigure 4. Representative image to distinguish SIRF signals at various stages of the cell cycle. The above panel shows an example of RAD51 SIRF (red channel) in HAP-1 cells treated with 125 μM EdU for 8 min and 200 μM HU for 4 h. The arrows indicate cells in late S-phase based on EdU patterning. Note that the green signal for Alexa 488 azide co-click enables distinction of late S-phase versus early S-phase cells. Scale bars = 20 μm.Place slides in the slide box facing up (Figure 3), and add 30 μl/well click-iT reaction cocktail. Cover slides with new plastic cover slips, taking care to avoid air bubbles. Close lid of slide box, which allows for humid chamber conditions, and incubate at RT for 1 h.Blocking and primary antibody incubationRemove plastic cover slips and wash slides in Coplin jar containing PBS (pH 7.4) for 5 min at RT. Place slides back in humid chamber and add 30 μl/well blocking buffer (10% goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS). Cover slides with new plastic cover slips, taking care to avoid and discourage air bubbles. Close slide box and incubate at RT for 1 h. Dilute primary antibodies of interest in blocking buffer. Different dilutions may need to be tested for optimal signals. Use a complementary anti-biotin antibody in conjunction with an antibody against the protein of interest. For example, shown in Figure 5, is the use of a mouse anti-biotin (1:100, Sigma) and rabbit anti-RPA antibody pair (see Notes). When using a mouse anti-protein of interest antibody, chose a rabbit anti-biotin (1:200, Cell Signaling).",
    "Take off plastic cover slips from slides and gently tap off the blocking buffer.Add 30-40 μl primary antibody mixture per well and apply new plastic cover slips, avoiding and discouraging air bubbles. Place slides inside the humid chamber and incubate at 4 °C overnight. Proximity ligation assay (PLA)Wash slides in Coplin jar containing 60 ml Duolink wash buffer A (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20) three times for 5 min each. Prepare Duolink In Situ PLA probes anti-plus and anti-minus against the respective primary antibodies by diluting them 1:5 in blocking buffer. For example, prepare anti-mouse plus and anti-rabbit minus in the example given in Figure 5 when using rabbit anti-RPA and mouse anti-biotin. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190916/20190916233058_2209.jpgFigure 5. Representative RPA-SIRF image in HAP-1 cells. A. Representative images of an RPA-SIRF assay in HAP-1 cells that have been treated with 125 μM EdU for 8 min. The cells were co-clicked with biotin-azide and Alexa 488-azide (10:1, total 10 μM). The GFP channel shows the EdU-Alexa 488 signal of S-phase cells. PLA signals are visualized in TXRED channel. The PLA signal can be normalized to the Alexa 488 signal to account for PLA signal differences depending on EdU content of the cells. B. Representative images of RPA-SIRF with no EdU condition (negative control). Scale bars = 20 μm.Tap off excess wash buffer and place slides in pre-warmed (37 °C) humid chamber.
