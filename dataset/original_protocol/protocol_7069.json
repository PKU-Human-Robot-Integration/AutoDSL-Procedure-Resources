    "Anopheles dirus rearingFeed blood to female mosquitoes every 4 days with a Hemotek device placed on top of the cage. Provide females with constant access to 10% sucrose solution. Two-days post-feed, insert a Petri dish containing a humid layer of cotton covered by a disc of Whatman paper into the cage. The next morning, recover the eggs laid on the Whatman paper (Figure 2C). Place the Whatman paper with eggs in a laboratory tray with water.Upon hatching, feed the larvae every day with ground Koi fish food ad libitium. Change larval water every two days and clean the remaining food every other day. Count larvae at the first transfer to have a density of 150 larvae in the small laboratory trays and 300 larvae in the large laboratory trays.Collect pupae every morning, using a transfer pipet with the bottom 0.5 cm cut off; this is to ensure a sufficiently large bore opening to avoid damaging the pupae (Figure 2D). Transfer the pupae to transparent plastic cups (maximum 100 pupae/cup). Add water to until 2 cm below the top of the cup. Place the cup in a cage.For 3 days post-emergence, feed the mosquitoes with 20% sucrose and multivitamins solution. On day 4, change this to 5% sucrose solution. Remove the sugar in the evening of day 4. On day 5, use a vacuum aspirator to transfer females to paper cups covered with nets held by an elastic band (Figure 2D). Keep the cups in the dark. Females are available for an infectious bloodmeal until day 7. On days 5 and 6, if the females have not been used for an infectious bloodmeal, provide 5% sugar solution on a cotton pad for 1 h in the evening.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4253/bioprotoc-11-23-4253-g002.jpgFigure 2.

Keep blood at 37°C during all manipulations.Centrifuge the blood at 1,300 × g for 5 min at 37°C.Remove the patient plasma and replace it by heat-inactivated (56°C for 30 min) naïve human AB serum to avoid transmission-blocking immunity (Bousema et al., 2012). Mix red blood cells and serum. Pipette 450 µl of this mixture into the water-jacketed mini-feeders maintained at 37°C using a pump and water bath (Figure 2A and 2B).Allow females to engorge for 1 h.Transfer the females from the cups to the cages. Once in the cage, fed and unfed females can be visually sorted out (using an insect aspirator) by the enlarged darkened abdomen of the blood-fed females. Remove all unfed females. Keep fed females in standard insectary conditions at 26°C and 80% humidity, with 10% sucrose + 0.05% PABA solution until dissection.",
    "On day 6 post-infectious blood meal, dissect the midgut of 10 females and collect midguts in 1% mercurochrome solution under a stereomicroscope (Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Occular view of a An. dirus midgut dissection to count oocysts. Mount the midguts under cover slips and count the number of oocysts at 10-20× magnification (Figure 2F).For positive feeds (i.e., females with oocysts on day 6), perform a test salivary gland dissection on 10 females between day 14 and 16 post-feed. Dissect the midguts to assess oocyst opening as well as salivary glands, to determine the sporozoite load (see Procedure E, Figure 2G, and Video 2, Figure 3).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Occular view of a An. dirus salivary gland dissection to obtain sporozoites. Dose response drug plate preparationThe following instructions are for generating a source drug plate containing 14 test compounds in a 12-point dilution series (1:3) from a 50 mM highest dose with duplicate wells per concentration. Map all compounds by row of a 384-well plate, include a DMSO vehicle (negative) control and nigericin (positive) control diluted from 200 μM. Label drug plates as needed (Table S1[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20210923/Table S1.xlsx]).Compound providers may send drugs as powder or liquid, either individually vialed or in a microtiter plate. If powder, prepare stock solutions at 10 mM or 50 mM in sterile DMSO; 50 mM stock is ideal to limit the total amount of DMSO in the final working solution and provide enough drug to detect activity, despite the possibility of the compound being inactivated by hepatic metabolism.Formula weight (FW) is the base and salt (if any) molecular weights together. If the compound has a salt component use FW, not molecular weight of base.10 mM stock: 100,000× (mg/FW) = μl DMSO to add to make a 10 mM solution.",
    "50 mM stock: 20,000× (mg/FW) = μl DMSO to add to make a 50 mM solution.For example, primaquine is commercially available as primaquine bisphosphate with a formula weight of 455.34 g/mol. Starting with a vial containing 10 mg of primaquine bisphosphate powder, a 10 mM stock could be made by adding 2,196 µl of DMSO to the vial, or a 50 mM stock could be made by adding 439 µl of DMSO to the vial.Add 15 µl of 50 mM stock solution to the appropriate row of columns 1 and 13.Move plates into the hood of the Biomek 4000. Add 10 ml of sterile DMSO to an autoclaved quarter reservoir in the reservoir stand. Using the MP200 head and the dilution series function, mix 5 µl of the source column 5× at 10 µl/s without any air gap or blowout (to reduce bubble formation). Then draw and aspirate 5 µl to the second column and mix 8× as above. Repeat the dilution series until column 12, then stop and replace tips. Apply this pattern to the replicate wells of the dilution series (columns 13-24), and for the alternative rows of compounds that have not yet been diluted by the 8-channel head (Video 3).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 3. Making a dilution series in a 384-well microtiter plate with a Biomek 4000. Cover diluted plates with a sterile foil seal and spin at 100 × g for 1 min to remove air bubbles (Figure 3A). Plates are stored at -80°C and shipped on dry ice.Hepatocyte seeding and cultureHepatocyte seeding is performed 2 days before salivary glands are dissected from infected mosquitoes for sporozoite infection.",
    "Prepare for the seed by making 250 ml of complete hepatocyte media (CM, see Recipes below, scale up volume if more media is needed), labeling 384-well assay plates, heating a water bath to 37°C, obtaining a hemocytometer, and transferring necessary reagents to tubes. Speed is important during seeding, so all materials must be ready before thawing.Using the 16-channel pipettor and media reservoir, add 20 µl of CP medium to each well to pre-wet the assay plate. Ensure liquid is in the bottom of each well (not on the sides); gently tap the assay plate on a hard surface to ensure all liquid rests on the bottom of wells, if needed.Before proceeding, determine how many cryovials of hepatocytes to thaw. Primary human hepatocytes from BioIVT typically include 6 × 106-10 × 106 live cells per vial and each plate requires 6.25 × 106-8.5 × 106 cells (see section Hepatocyte lot selection above for more information). Then, add (# vials) × 4 ml of CM to a 50 ml conical centrifuge tube.Add 50 µl of Trypan Blue to an Eppendorf tube.Following appropriate safety precautions, obtain the cryovials from liquid nitrogen storage. Slightly twist open the cap of each tube to vent possible nitrogen gas inside, thereby preventing possible cryovial explosion. Immediately thaw in the water bath for exactly 120 s, without the vial opening being immersed in the water and without swirling. After 120 s, there will momentarily be an ice sliver inside the vial. Close the caps and quickly rinse vials with 70% ethanol for sterility, then dry the vial with a clean wipe. Move vials into a sterile field (i.e., Class II Biosafety Cabinet-BSC) and remove the vial caps.",
    "Using specifically a 1 ml pipette with a 1 ml tip, slowly remove the thawed vial contents and transfer to the 50 ml conical tube with CM. Do not mix the cryovial contents. Once thawed, cryovial contents are collected from all vials, take 1 ml of CM from the 50 ml collection conical and use to rinse and collect all remaining material from the vials (which should now be completely thawed). The 50 ml tube should now have a volume of (# vials) × 5 ml.Swirl the 50 ml conical tube to mix and transfer 50 µl of hepatocytes in CM to the Eppendorf tube with Trypan Blue. Mix slowly thrice, then transfer 10 µl of the mixture to a hemocytometer. Count live cells in all four 4 × 4 quadrants and calculate cell concentration using:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20211202/20211202020853_9239.jpg and live cell quantity by using:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20211202/20211202020908_8851.jpg Viability should be above 75%. Using CM, adjust concentration to:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20211202/20211202020922_2135.jpg For example, assuming a target seed density of 18,000 live cells per well and a thaw with 7.5 × 106 live cells from a single cryovial, adjust concentration to 900 cells per µl using:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20211202/20211202021001_1279.jpg Mix well using a 10 or 25 ml serological pipette and transfer to a reagent reservoir. Use the 16-channel pipette to transfer 20 µl of cell mixture per well.Notes:  Critical note 1: Do not use the blowout function on the 16-channel pipette. This will cause bubbles and decrease seed accuracy Critical note 2: Hepatocytes settle quickly in media. Seed only 1 plate before stopping and re-mixing the hepatocyte suspension using a 10 ml serological pipette and continue with the next plate; mix more often if needed. To prevent edge-effect due to evaporation, prepare a Bioassay Dish with 4 small Petri dishes with 10 ml water each, as shown in Figure 3B.",
    "Place plates in a cell culture incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2. Do not change media before infection with sporozoites.On the day of infection, place all assay plates to be infected inverted into an aluminum spin holder in the BSC (Figure 3C), then place them in a centrifuge with microtiter plate holders and spin at 40 × g for 1 min with minimum acceleration to remove all media. Transfer the plate and aluminum spin holder to the BSC and clean the top of the plate using a sterile lint-free cloth. Using a media reservoir and 16-channel pipette, add back 20 µl of CM per well. (The additional 20 µl of CM will be added as part of the infection procedure).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4253/bioprotoc-11-23-4253-g003.jpgFigure 3.

    "Make up the dissection buffer by adding 10 ml of PBS into a 15 ml conical tube.Make up the collection buffer by adding 100 µl of RPMI (without NaHCO3) to an Eppendorf tube.Place the 6-well plate, dissection buffer, and collection buffer on ice.Obtain the Petri dish and place next to the ice bucket.Place several puddles of 20 µl dissection buffer on autoclaved glass slides; one puddle will be needed for each mosquito to be dissected. Make only one glass slide at a time.Immobilize mosquitoes by spraying 70% ethanol through the mesh lid, ensure all mosquitoes are immobilized, and remove the lid. Using the forceps, quickly but carefully move all mosquitoes to the Petri dish, and then move all mosquitoes into the PSN-PBS well on ice. Do not let mosquitoes rest in ethanol for more than 2 min as this will dehydrate the mosquitoes and reduce sporozoite viability.Notes:  Safety note: Make sure all mosquitoes are immobilized with ethanol. Ethanol will not kill the mosquitoes immediately. Regard mosquitoes as infectious vectors until after dissection. Never open a cup outside of an ACL2 room. Safety note: Obtain all mosquitoes from the cup and account for all mosquitoes before, during, and after dissection. Safety note: Persons should not enter or exit the ACL2 room when mosquitoes are out of cups. Safety note: Use lids on the Petri dish and 6-well plate to enclose mosquitoes to further ensure none can escape. Technical note: Keep mosquitoes on the PSN-PBS buffer on ice to maintain sporozoite viability. Technical note: Once mosquitoes are sprayed with ethanol, complete dissection steps in less than 60 min; set a timer. Sporozoite viability can be reduced with excessive dissection time.",
    "Using forceps, pick individual mosquitoes by their proboscis and drag each through the middle (70% ethanol) and right (PBS) top wells of the 6 well plate, making sure to let them soak for 1-2 s in each well. Pulling the mosquito through liquid by holding to the proboscis will help dissection greatly, as the legs and wings will be swept back by the forward motion through the liquid. The ethanol step is the most important as an ethanol coating will help discharge static and surface tension on the mosquito surface. Completely dunk the mosquito in the ethanol part of the wash. Be sure to pull the mosquito through the washes in the same direction (i.e., left to right only) to ensure that wings and legs are away from the head. Place each washed mosquito into a separate PBS puddle on the glass slide (Figure 4A-4E and Video 4).(Dissectors may be right or left-handed, the following is for holding the forceps in the right hand and the dissection needle in the left hand). With the proboscis facing right, hold the forceps in the right hand and the needle in the left hand. Bracket the head with the forceps while simultaneously holding the thorax with the needle almost horizontally parallel to the glass slide. Then, simultaneously pull the head to the right while depressing the thorax with the needle. With practice, glands will fall out of the thorax with proper depression and pull pressure – the amount of pressure used for depressing the thorax is key: excess pressure results in a pierced thorax, insufficient pressure results in glands remaining in the thorax when the head is pulled away.",
    "While continuing to immobilize the head using the forceps, gather the glands by hooking them with the needles and place them in the collection buffer on ice using a spinning motion, as glands may stick to the needle. Repeat for each mosquito (Video 2).Notes:  Technical note: Do not rummage around the dissection buffer for missing glands; this increases time per mosquito and increases the chance of microbial contamination downstream. Technical note: 6 to 10 mosquitoes can be set up per dissection slide. The total number of mosquitoes processed depends on the number of dissectors and the dissection speed. Once the cleanliness of each dissector has been ascertained, salivary glands can be pooled between dissectors. <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 4. Mosquito wash and placement on slide prior to salivary gland dissection. Centrifuge the collection tube at 1,000 × g for 2 min. Glands will stick to the side of the Eppendorf, and centrifugation is needed to pellet the glands.Keep the collection buffer with glands on ice and move to a BSC. Use the matching pestle (sterilized by autoclave) to crush the glands by spinning the pestle against the bottom of the Eppendorf tube 10×. Add 100 µl of RPMI (without NaHCO3) to the collection tube to rinse the pestle during removal. Further crush and mix glands and sporozoites by pipetting up and down 100 times using the 100 µl tip.Obtain a new Eppendorf tube and fill with 18 µl of PBS. In this tube, mix 2 µl of crushed glands and sporozoites, making a 1:10 dilution. Transfer 10 µl of the dilution to a hemocytometer and count sporozoites in two 4 × 4 quadrants. Calculate net sporozoites using:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20211202/20211202021845_2588.jpg and sporozoite quantity by using:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20211202/20211202021859_5553.jpg Typically between 15,000 to 20,000 sporozoites are inoculated into each assay well; thus, between 6.4 × 106-8.",
    "5 × 106 sporozoites are required per plate. One dissection of 300 mosquitoes typically results in 15 × 106-35 × 106 sporozoites, thus between 2 to 6 plates can be inoculated from a single dissection. Determine how many assay plates can be infected and place:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20211202/20211202021914_6275.jpg into a reservoir. Add all sporozoites in the collection buffer, using 200 µl of CM to wash the collection tube. Mix the entire volume at least 10× with a serological pipette to ensure an even sporozoite suspension. Using the 16-channel pipette, add 20 µl of inoculum to each well.Spin each inoculated assay plate at 200 × g for 5 min and then place the assay plate back into the Bioassay Dish in the incubator. Do not change media later on infection day.Perform a media change the day after infection, before addition of compounds on each treatment day, and on the days indicated for a specific assay version (Figure 1A). To change media, place a plate inverted into an aluminum spin holder in the BSC (Figure 3C), then place in a centrifuge with microtiter plate holders and spin at 40 × g for 1 min with minimum acceleration to remove all media. Transfer the plate and aluminum spin holder to the BSC and clean the top of the plate using a sterile lint-free cloth. Using a media reservoir and 16-channel pipette, add back 40 µl of CM per well.Compound treatmentThaw drug plates by centrifugation (200 × g for 10 min) to ensure the compound solution is in the bottom of the wells and will not cross-contaminate adjacent wells upon thaw.All assay versions include a media change prior to treatment.",

Fill the fifth tray with 45 ml of 70% ethanol (Figure 5).Perform the morning pintool wash by dipping pins thrice in the first tray (V&P clean solution), followed by a blot. Repeat the dip and blot. Perform and repeat once the three dip-and-blot wash in the second tray (water) and third tray (methanol). However, after the last methanol dip, place the pin tool in its holder instead of blotting, as this will sterilize the pins (Figure 4 and Video 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4253/bioprotoc-11-23-4253-g004.jpgFigure 4.

For a Lionheart FX, a 4× objective is used to capture an entire well with 4 fields of view per well. Images are stitched prior to analysis using the standard stitch algorithm available as an image processing module in Gen5 using DAPI as the registration channel.Quantifying High Content Imaging DataNote: This step is demonstrated using a Lionheart FX with Gen5 analysis software. Similar workflows can be developed on other HCI systems. Intensity values will vary from run to run; modify the values before performing an analysis.Pick a well with parasites (i.e., not an effective dose of an active compound) to modify an analysis. Open the analysis setup window.Looking at the blue channel, use the cursor to estimate the average nuclei signal intensity. Also hover over the background to understand background intensity. Take the difference between the nuclei and background intensities and use this number for your primary mask value. For example, if the nuclei intensity is 26,000, and the background is 6,000, use a value of 20,000 for the primary mask.

    "Hypnozoites are 28-100 µm2, but a small number of very large hypnozoites (or, possibly reactivating schizonts) are found between 100-150 µm2.Once the analysis is performed, perform an export to obtain the number of nuclei per well, number of hypnozoites per well, number of schizonts for each well, and the net schizont growth (in µm2) per well (see Table S2[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20210923/Table S2.xlsx] as an example). Proceed to data normalization and curve fitting."
