A schematic outline of the fluorescence-based heme quantitation in Toxoplasma gondii. Please refer to the text for more details.In this protocol, wildtype (RH∆ku80∆hxg), ∆cpox (a heme-deficient strain), and ∆cpoxCPOX (a TgCPOX complementation strain) strains are included as examples. If parasite strains are stored at -80°C, they must be thawed at 37°C and immediately passed to a T25 tissue culture flask containing fully confluent human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells. After the parasites lyse the host cells, ~300 µl fully lysed wildtype and ∆cpoxCPOX parasites were passed to one T25 tissue culture flask coated with HFF cells for a 2-day passage. For the ∆cpox strain, the inoculum was increased to 2 ml to compensate for its severe growth defects. 1-2 T25 flasks of parasites per strain are needed depending on their growth phenotype. Since the ∆cpox showed severe growth defects, two flasks of ∆cpox parasites were used in this assay. The wildtype and ∆cpoxCPOX strains were passed into one T25 flask.Pre-cool DPBS on ice and keep the infected cells on ice. Scrape the infected HFFs and syringe them three times using a 20 G needle, followed by three times using a 25 G needle. The lysates were passed through a 3.0-µm filter to remove intact host cells and large host cell debris. Rinse the flasks with 5 ml ice-cold DPBS and pass through the filter to wash.Fill a 1,000-ml glass beaker with water and keep it boiling on a hot plate for sample heating. The boiling water will be used in Step 16 to heat the samples.Centrifuge parasites at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. After centrifugation, a parasite pellet is expected to be seen at the bottom of the centrifuge tube.",
    "Carefully aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the parasite pellet in 10 ml ice-cold DPBS. Repeat Step 4. Check for the pellet before proceeding.Aspirate the supernatant carefully and resuspend the pellet in 10 ml ice-cold DPBS.Quantitate the yield of purified parasites using a hemocytometer following the vendor’s instructions.Pellet the parasites at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the parasites in 1 ml ice-cold DPBS and transfer to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube.Spin down the parasites at 5,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min.Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the remaining pellet in 400 µl ice-cold DPBS.Sonicate each purified parasite strain inside a biosafety cabinet using a Branson Analog Sonifier ultrasonic cell disrupter S-250A with a tapered 1/8-inch microtip, using the following settings: output intensity = 3 and Duty% = 20%. Sonicate each purified parasite strain for 10 s and repeat 4 times. Wait for 30 s between each repeat and keep samples on ice to avoid overheating.A hemin standard curve is needed for the measurement of absolute heme abundance per parasite. The hemin stock is initially diluted in DPBS to 1,200 nM, followed by a 3-fold serial dilution to generate 5 additional concentrations at 400, 133.3, 44.4, 14.8, and 4.9 nM. DPBS alone is also included as a blank for 0 nM hemin.Add 100 µl each sample or hemin standard to black 1.5-ml centrifuge tubes. Two sets for each strain or hemin standard are prepared; one will be boiled and another one will remain at room temperature.Add 900 µl 2 M oxalic acid to each sample and vortex for complete mixing.Keep one set of samples and hemin dilutions in a rack at room temperature and place another set in a tube holder to boil for 30 min.",
    "Place the boiled samples on ice for 5 min and then leave them at room temperature for 10 min. Mix all samples by vortexing.Pipette 200 µl each parasite stain or hemin standard into each well of a black 96-well plate in triplicate.Read the samples using a BioTek Synergy H1 Hybrid Multi-Mode Microplate Reader with the following settings: Excitation: 400 nm, Emission: 608 nm, Optics: Top, Gain: 135, Read Speed: Normal, Delay: 100 msec, Measurements/Data Point: 10, and Read Height: 7 mm. Export the acquired data to an Excel spreadsheet.Repeat the assay in at least three biological replicates for statistical significance comparison."
