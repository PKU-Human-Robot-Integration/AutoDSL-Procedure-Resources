    "Cell culture (all steps in laminar flow cabinet) Culture cells by following established protocols for adherent cell lines (for more details see Note 1).Split cells 2–3 times per week or as needed (for more details see Note 2).Seeding cells for immunostaining (all steps in laminar flow cabinet) Fill appropriate cell culture dish (6-well) with ddH2O (2 mL).Sterilize glass coverslips by dipping multiple times into 70% ethanol using sterilized tweezers.Transfer glass coverslips to a ddH2O-filled dish. Make sure to submerge coverslips.Aspirate ddH2O.Cover glass coverslips with 100 μL of 0.1% gelatine each and incubate for at least 15 min (preferably overnight) at 37 °C.Aspirate remaining gelatine solution.Split cells as usual and seed 0.25 × 106 cells in a glass coverslip–containing dish.Incubate for at least 18 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.Immunostaining for DNA base modifications Remove medium from cells that were seeded the day before at a density of 0.25 × 106 per p35 dish.Carefully wash cells with 1 mL of 1× PBS and discard PBS.Fix cells with 1 mL of 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature.Remove formaldehyde solution.Wash three times with 2 mL of PBS-T (for more details see Note 3).Permeabilize cells with 1 mL of 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min.Remove Triton X-100.Add ice-cold 88% methanol and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.Remove methanol.Wash as before three times with PBS-T.Prepare a wet chamber with moist gel-blotting paper and Parafilm on top (for more details see Note 4 and Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4716/bioprotoc-13-14-4716-g002.jpgFigure 2. Diagram of a wet chamber for immunostaining Prepare a 100 μg/mL RNase A in 1× PBS solution.Place coverslips cell side down in 20 μL droplets of RNase A solution on Parafilm and incubate for 1 h at 37 °C.",
    "Wash three times with PBS-T, by carefully adding 100 μL of PBS-T droplets under the coverslips (for more details see Note 5).Block for 30 min at 37 °C by placing coverslips in 20 μL of 1% BSA in 1× PBS cell side down.Prepare primary antibody solution (detection solution) per coverslip. For one coverslip use:10 μL of 2% BSA in PBS.10 μL of DNase buffer (2×).0.25 μL of DNase I (2,000 U/mL).Antibody against 5mC (1:250).Antibody against 5-hmC, 5-fC, or 5-caC (1:250, 1:100, or 1:100, respectively).Place coverslips cell side down in detection solution.Incubate at 37 °C for 70 min.Wash three times with 100 μL droplets of PBS-TE (0, 5, and 10 min).Dilute secondary antibodies.Prepare 20 μL of secondary antibody solution (detection solution) per coverslip. For one coverslip use:20 μL of 2% BSA in PBS.Secondary antibody goat α-mouse IgG (H+L) Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated (1:500).Secondary antibody goat α-rabbit IgG (H+L) Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated (1:500).Incubate with secondary antibodies at room temperature for 45 min.Wash three times with 100 μL droplets of PBS-T (0, 5, and 10 min).Counterstain with 20 μL of 1 μg/mL DAPI for 10 min.Meanwhile, take out a glass slide and put a 20 μL drop of Mowiol mounting medium on top.After DAPI staining, briefly wash coverslip by dipping in ddH2O.Dry excess water by carefully tipping the edge of the coverslip on a paper tissue.Place on top of the mounting medium with the cells side facing down.Microscopy Set up the image acquisition settings for each channel and use the same settings for all images, avoiding oversaturation.Acquire images from higher to lower wavelength, starting with red, green, and blue at the end. See Note 6 for setting details.Acquire Z-stack images with a fixed Z-step length, preferably 0.5 μm. Acquire enough Z-stack to image the whole nuclei from “top” to “bottom.",
    "” For the majority of the cells, 10–12 Z-stacks are enough.For further image processing in Fiji, data should be exported as .tiff files as Multicolor Z-stack.Image analysis (manual procedure using Fiji) The purpose of this image analysis pipeline is to use DAPI intensities to segment the cell nuclei, creating a nuclear mask, and then segment heterochromatic regions (HCmask). Euchromatic regions are defined by heterochromatin subtraction from the nucleus mask. Once these subnuclear compartments are defined, the final aim of the analysis is to measure cytosine modification levels within these different regions. Minor optimizations to the following procedure can be applied for different cell types or imaging systems.Pre-processingAnalyze → Set Measurements → select the desired properties to be measured (see Note 7).Edit → Options → Colors… → Foreground: black; Background: black; Selection: white.

Image processing and in situ quantitative analysis pipeline for cytosine modifications levels. After immunofluorescence detection of DNA base modifications and image acquisition by confocal microscopy, the preprocessing of the multicolor Z-stack is performed in Fiji. Afterwards, the nucleus, heterochromatin, and the euchromatic nucleoplasm are segmented into regions of interest (ROIs) based on their respective DAPI signals, and binary masks are generated. Signals of all channels in the respective ROIs are then measured based on the binary masks and results exported as .csv files.Image analysis (semi-automated procedure) In addition to the step-by-step analysis procedure described in section E, in this section we describe a semi-automated analysis pipeline using a macro in Fiji. The semi-automated procedure speeds up the analysis process along with a higher standardization for different samples.",
    "Start the semi-automated image analysis pipeline macro by opening it in Fiji (see File S1).Open a Multicolor Z-stack image of interest.Click “Run” in the Macro UI.You will be prompted to select the DAPI channel. Use the channel slider to move to the DAPI channel and click “OK” in the dialogue box.You will be prompted to choose a nucleus of interest. After clicking on the nucleus of interest, confirm by clicking “OK” in the dialogue box.You will be prompted to set a threshold for the heterochromatin regions. Use the sliders in the threshold menu to adjust and confirm by clicking “OK” in the dialogue box.Based on the DAPI signal, the macro generates ROIs for (I) the nucleus, (II) the heterochromatin, (III) the euchromatic nucleoplasm. Based on these ROIs, the macro quantifies the fluorescence intensities in channel 1 for ROI I, II, and III, in channel 2 for ROI I, II, and III, and in channel 3 for ROI I, II, and III.You are prompted to save the measurements as a .csv file. Save with “Ctrl + S” and confirm by clicking “OK” in the dialogue box.All windows will be closed, and you can continue with the next image, starting from step 2."
