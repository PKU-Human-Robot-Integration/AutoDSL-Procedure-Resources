    "1. Microtomy for Unstained Sections\nSet up water bath and microtome as for standard paraffin microtomy. Use positively charged slides and pre-label with case number, pancreas region (sample) and slide number. Place paraffin block in the microtome chuck with the cassette label on the left side.  \nFollow normal microtomy procedures, section into block until tissue is uniformly encountered. Produce a ribbon of serial sections (4 μm thick, 3-6 depending on number of initial required stains (See Case Submission Form, Appendix 1)). Separate sections in the ribbon, pick up each in order, and place on slides with order numbered with pencil. Denote if a section is unused by numbering sections in exact order. Maintain the same orientation on the slide as found in the cassette with the slide label oriented to the left. Dry overnight at room temperature then proceed with staining or distribution to investigators.\nReseal surface of paraffin block with thin layer of paraffin to preserve tissue and archive at room temperature or -20 °C.\nFor subsequent microtomy, maintain numbering for serial sections at each level as above. Obtain 1 additional slide and stain by H&E slide for each ~100 μM level within each block.\n2. H&E Staining\nPlace the first serial sectioned slide from each block in a slide rack then in the first tray on the autostainer. \nSelect the standard H&E stain program and proceed as usual. \nWhen finished staining, remove the slides from autostainer and place in hood for coverslipping. \nCoverslip using standard technique. Dry thoroughly and label with a printed label (see section 12). \n3. IHC Set-up",
    "Select the Dako program for double stains and input numbers of slides. Prepare TBST and citrate buffers, antibodies, and other reagents according to specified volumes (Table 1). Load the reagent tray and slides. Rotation of clean and waste lines are programmed according to manufacturer's recommendations. \nIf performing these assays manually, prepare estimated volumes.  Incubate slides in a humidified chamber to avoid slides drying out at any step. Follow the same procedure for each reagents as when used for the autostainer. \n4. IHC Deparaffinization and Antigen Retrieval\nPut slides in xylene for 5 minutes. Repeat once. Do not allow the slides to dry out at any subsequent point until indicated as this will result in excessive background and poor staining.\nTransfer slides to 100% ethanol for 2 minutes. Repeat once.\nPut slides in freshly prepared 3% H2O2 in methanol for 10 minutes. \nDip slides in 90% Ethanol and then place in 90% Ethanol for 3 minutes.\nTransfer slides to 70% Ethanol for 1 minute.\nRinse slides in de-ionized water.\nPreheat steamer and citrate buffer in steamer for 5 minutes. \nAdd slides to citrate buffer in the steamer and steam for 30 minutes.\nImmediately transfer slides to water and hold until slides cool to room temperature (~20 minutes).\nTransfer slides to the Dako autostainer racks according to stain sequence (Figure 1) and run the double staining program. The major steps of the autostainer program are listed so that manual runs can duplicate.  \n5. First Primary Antibodies (Ki-67, CD3, Pancreatic Polypeptide)\nBlock slides with Sniper solution for 15 minutes. Wash twice with TBST.\nIncubate slides in primary antibody for 30 minutes. Wash twice with TBST.\nIncubate with Mach2 goat anti-mouse (Ki-67) or anti-rabbit (CD3, pancreatic polypeptide) horse radish peroxidase (HRP) polymer for 30 minutes. Wash twice with TBST.",
    "Apply 3,3 -diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) to slides for 4 minutes. Wash twice with water.\nSlides incubated with pancreatic polypeptide are held on the Dako when being assayed concurrently and TBST used for all subsequent steps while the remaining slides are incubated with the second set of primary antibodies. Alternatively, for manual assays, proceed to section 6.\n6. Second Primary Antibodies (Insulin, Glucagon)\nIncubate slides in DEEB for 20 minutes. Wash twice with TBST.\nBlock with 10% normal goat serum in 20% avidin blocker in TBST (insulin) or Sniper (glucagon) in TBST for 20 minutes. Wash twice with TBST.\nIncubate with insulin or glucagon primary antibody for 15 minutes. Wash twice with TBST.\nInsulin: Incubate slides in biotinylated goat anti-guinea pig at 1:300 dilution for 30 minutes. Wash twice with TBST. Incubate with standard vector ABC-AP reagent for 30 minutes. Wash twice with TBST.\nGlucagon: Incubate slides in buffer during for 30 minutes followed by goat anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase (AP) polymer for 30 minutes. Wash twice with TBST.\n While slides are incubated in conjugates, warm the LPR buffer to room temperature. Add 1 drop of liquid permanent red (LPR) per 3 mL buffer immediate before use and place in Dako reagent rack. Incubate slides in LPC for 4 minutes. Wash twice with water.\nIncubate slides in hematoxylin for 1 minute. Rinse twice with water.\nIncubate slides in TBS pH 7.6 for 1 minute. Rinse twice with water.\nUnload slides from DAKO Autostainer.\nImmediately dehydrate slides stained for pancreatic polypeptide. For all double stained slides, dry for at least 1 hour then dehydrate.\n7. Dehydration\nPlace slides in 80% ethanol for 1 minute.\nDip slides in 95% ethanol.\nHold slides in 95% ethanol for 30 seconds.\nTransfer slides to 100% ethanol and hold 1 minute. Repeat.\nDip slides in xylene.",
    "Hold slides in xylene for 1 minute. Repeat.\nImmediately mount coverslips on slides using cytoseal.\n8. Slide Labeling\nEnter the case identification information including organ and block number, stain, and date and print. Serial section number is optional for the first slide stains of each block. Subsequent levels are denoted by numbering.\nPlace labels on slides.\n9. Slide Scanning\nPlace stained slides in scanner tray and scan according to instrumentation. \nOrganize slides by donor and tissue  type (pancreas head, body, tail, spleen).\nArchive stained slides at room temperature and any remaining unstained slides at -20 °C until used. \n10. Representative Results",
    "These staining procedures were developed for the JDRF Network for  Pancreatic Organ donors with Diabetes (nPOD) to provide baseline  characterization of paraffin and fresh frozen blocks. Each donor has a baseline  characterization performed comprised of staining 2 blocks from each pancreas  region (head, body, and tail) and the spleen (Figure 1, see also case submission form, Appendix 1). The H&E  staining is conducted using an autostainer programmed as for a clinical  facility with clinical-grade solutions used throughout. As additional donor  blocks are sectioned, each has a slide taken for H&E to show tissue  morphology. When blocks are sectioned again, as for distribution to  investigators, deeper levels will also have slides taken for representative H&E  slides to document the entire block's tissue morphology as well as numbering  serial sections at each level. Stained slides are labeled with case  identification, pancreas region, block number, stain and date (Figure 2) and scanned into the online  pathology information management system. Representative images from a control  donor are shown in Figure 3 at both  low and high magnifications to show expected results following this procedure.  The slide stained with pancreatic polypeptide (D,H) was assayed on a different  day with the assay performed manually and shows reduced staining intensity of  the hematoxylin counterstain. Differences in staining intensity of primary  antibodies or counterstain between assays is to be avoided particularly if  using image analysis otherwise slides with require individual color correction  to achieve the same cell areas or counts.",
    "Each laboratory should expect to optimize antibody concentrations as  lot-to-lot variation and other reagents and conditions can impact staining  intensity and specificity. With acquisition of new reagents, staining procedures  are validated with known positive and negative control samples to achieve the  same degree of stain intensity as with former reagents. Additional antibodies  optimized in the nPOD pathology core are provided in Table 2 as a reference source and have been used for multilabeling immunofluorescence  assays for confocal microscopy.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4068/4068fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Dako staining grid.  This schematic depicts a routine analysis from a nPOD donor pancreas performed on a Dako autostainer. The nPOD donors are coded with a 4-digit identification number. Two slide trays are shown with slides organized by stain. Alternate slide configurations are expected depending on numbers of donor slides. Positive controls include inclusion of a known positive donor for the two double stains and donor spleen for Ki-67 and CD3. Negative controls are twofold and include two slides from one donor pancreas block incubated with immunoglobulin (Ig) from the host species of the primary antibodies and two slides from donor spleen for insulin and glucagon. \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4068/4068fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Figure 3. Representative H&E and IHC stains in pancreatic sections. Sections from the pancreas of an adult female organ donor (6096-04 PanHead) were stained and digital scans performed as described in the protocol. Images were obtained using the ImageScope viewing program of the entire section (A-D) and from one islet (E-H). The expected islet stain intensities for insulin, glucagon, and pancreatic polypeptide are observed for sections B-D as section D delineates that this pancreas head block contains a small portion of the uncinate region or ventral pancreatic lobe as all islets contain mainly pancreatic polypeptide-positive cells. Note that the hematoxylin counterstain in panel D is too light while the hematoxylin counterstain intensities in B and C are optimal. Panels E-H show an islet from the dorsal lobe with the expected distribution of β-cells and α-cells. A few pancreatic polypeptide cells are found in the lower left portion of the islet (H). A, E- H&E; B, F- Ki67+Insulin; C, G- CD3+Glucagon; D, H- Pancreatic polypeptide.  A-D, 0.2x, E-H- 12.8x.  Subscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
