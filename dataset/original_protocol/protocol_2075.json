    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDigitonin treatment\nTiming: 45 min\nWe used TCC-S cells to pull down native RNAs with G quadruplex sequences and we transfected DU145 cells with a plasmid that contains AGAP2 5′ UTR – the sequence we expected to form G quadruplexes in vivo – as mentioned above.\nUse 10–15 × 106 cells for each condition to achieve around 10 μg of total RNA/condition.\nTCC-S: cell suspension is centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min and the cells are resuspended in 3 mL of fresh medium and counted using an automatic cell counter (Fischer Scientific).\nDU145: 48 h post-transfection, cells are trypsinized by adding 5 mL of trypsin-EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 5 min. After incubation, 10 mL of complete medium is added to neutralize the trypsin-EDTA followed by the collection of the detached cells. The cells are centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min and resuspended in fresh medium.\nCentrifuge cells at 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nResuspend and wash the pellet with ice-cold PBS followed by centrifugation, repeat PBS wash.\nResuspend the pellet in 400 μL of ice-cold rG4IP lysis buffer (see troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).\nIncubate cells with lysis buffer in an end over end rotator at 4°C for 10 min.\nAfter incubation, centrifuge the cells at 2,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C to pellet the nuclei.\nPipette out and save the supernatant: this is the cytosolic fraction (lysate).\nCritical: Save 10% of the lysate (40 μL) as an Input control which will be used for normalization.\nPre-clearing\nTiming: 90 min\nA pre-clearing step helps reducing unspecific binding to the beads and contributes to lower background signal.",
    "Prepare Protein G magnetic beads for pre-clearing by thoroughly resuspending the magnetic beads in their solution and transferring 100 μL (1 mg, as stock 10 mg/mL) to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nMagnetize beads and remove the supernatant.\nWash the beads thrice with PBS-T, resuspend the beads thoroughly, magnetize and discard the supernatant.\nAdd the lysate to the washed beads and incubate for 1 h at 4°C in an end over end rotator.\nAfter incubation, briefly centrifuge and magnetize the beads and pipette out the lysate for incubation with the bound antibody in step 19.\nIncubation of pre-cleared lysate with beads bound to antibody\nTiming: 10 h\nThis section includes all necessary steps to bind the BG4 antibody to the magnetic beads and collect RNAs containing G quadruplex structures.\nPrepare Protein G magnetic beads for antibody binding by thoroughly resuspending the magnetic beads in their solution and transferring 100 μL (1 mg as 10 mg/mL) to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nMagnetize beads and remove the supernatant.\nWash the beads thrice with PBS-T, resuspend the beads thoroughly, magnetize and discard the supernatant.\nIncubate the beads with 3 μg of BG4 antibody or equivalent isotype-matched negative antibody control.\nIncubate in an end over end rotator for 1 h at 4°C.\nFollowing incubation, briefly centrifuge the beads and wash by resuspending in PBS followed by magnetizing the beads and discarding the supernatant. Repeat three times.\nAdd the pre-cleared lysate to the beads with antibody and incubate between 6 to 10 h at 4°C in a rotator.\nCritical: Do not incubate for more than 12 h as it would increase background signal (see troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]).\nWashing and elution\nTiming: 30 min\nNecessary steps to remove unspecific binding and to collect bounds RNAs.\nAfter overnight incubation, magnetize the beads and save the flow-through lysate.",
    "Note: If there are issues with antibody binding efficiency, the flow-through can be reused.\nWash the beads by resuspending in the lysis buffer and incubate in an end over end rotator for 5 min at 4°C. Repeat the washes three times.\nNote: The magnetic rack should be placed on ice during washing. The number of washes could be increased to five times to reduce background signals (see troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]).\nAfter the washes, resuspend the beads in 100 μL of nuclease-free water.\nIncubate at 65°C for 15 min to unfold and release the nucleic acid bound to the antibody.\nCritical: Do not incubate at 65°C for more than 15 min.\nMagnetize the beads and transfer the supernatant containing eluted nucleic acids into a new Eppendorf tube.\nDNase treatment\nTiming: 15 min\nAdd 10 μL of 10× DNase I Buffer and 1 μL of DNase I (2 U/μL) to the eluted sample and incubate for 15 min at 37°C.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1666-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Genomic DNA contamination in the G quadruplex enriched rG4IP sample\nIn the absence of DNase treatment, AGAP2 promoter region was detected in the eluant after immunoprecipitation with the BG4 antibody. The samples were processed identically except that in the [- DNase] sample the DNase treatment was omitted. The expression levels were normalized by the input control and presented relative to the [- DNase] condition. Data shown are the mean ± SD of two independent experiments performed at least in duplicate. ∗∗p < 0.01.\nNote: Incubation time could be increased to 30 min to enhance the degradation of genomic DNA [see troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]].",
    "Critical: The DNase treatment step is essential to prevent contamination and detection of DNA with G quadruplex structures (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). To ensure this step is effective we highly recommend using Ambion DNase I (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] for catalog number).\nRNA extraction\nTiming: 2 h\nCritical: Perform all procedures under RNase-free conditions using RNase-free buffer and consumables.\nAdd 1 mL TRIzol reagent to the DNase treated sample and 500 μL TRIzol to the input controls which were saved after digitonin treatment.\nInvert the tubes 5 times and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\nAdd 200 μL of chloroform per 1 mL of TRIzol used and shake the tube vigorously for 15 s and leave at room temperature for 5 min.\nCentrifuge the tube at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C to separate the solution into 3 layers: clear aqueous layer containing RNA, middle interphase layer containing mostly DNA and lower pink organic phase containing protein.\nCarefully remove the top aqueous phase (60% of the volume of TRIzol Reagent used) without disturbing the interphase and transfer to a fresh tube.\nRNA precipitation and washing\nAdd 20 μg glycogen and vortex briefly.\nAdd 500 μL of 100% room temperature isopropanol per 1 mL TRIzol reagent used.\nInvert the tubes 5 times and incubate at room temperature for 10–15 min.\nNote: It is not recommended to incubate with isopropanol for more than 15 min or overnight at −20°C.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C to precipitate the RNA.\nRemove the supernatant carefully and wash the pellet in 1 mL 75% ice-cold ethanol per 1 mL TRIzol reagent, briefly vortex to get the pellet off the side of the tube.\nCentrifuge at no more than 7,500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.",
    "Repeat the washing step with 75% ice-cold ethanol followed by centrifugation.\nNote the position of the pellet and carefully remove the ethanol using a pipette. Then centrifuge again to collect the remaining ethanol.\nRNA solubilization\nCarefully remove the remaining ethanol and air dry the pellet for 2–3 min at room temperature.\nCritical: Do not over-dry the pellet as it may be difficult to redissolve.\nResuspend the pellet in 15 μL of nuclease-free water (we expect between 100-150 ng RNA/μL after rG4IP) and use this whole volume in the reverse transcription, using random primers.\nUse 1 μL of cDNA to perform quantitative real-time PCR to analyze enrichment relative to the negative control antibody. Validate findings using other relevant positive and negative controls."
