    "Note: All procedures conducted in mice must first have institutional ACUC approval.    Culture and preparation of Myc-CaP cells for injection   Propagate Myc-CaP cells in tissue culture flasks with Myc-CaP growth media and passage as per ATCC guidelines. Engraft 1 x 106 Myc-CaP cells per mouse. Due to ‘dead space’ within the needle, overestimate the number of allografts needed by 20% or a minimum of two extra allografts. Note: Injecting more than 1 x 106 Myc-CaP cells per mouse is not recommended as it will accelerate primary tumor growth and shorten the time between engraftment and euthanasia due to morbidity. This may decrease the likelihood of observing metastatic disease.   Prior to harvesting Myc-CaP cells for injection, thaw Matrigel on ice.   Remove media from flasks containing 80-90% confluent monolayers of Myc-CaP cells, wash cells with 1x PBS, and detach cells by incubating in 0.05% trypsin-EDTA for 3-6 min in 37 °C incubator. Neutralize trypsin by adding growth media.   Transfer cells to a 50 ml conical tube and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min. Remove trypsin/media and then resuspend the cell pellet in fresh growth media.   Count cells to isolate 1 x 106 cells per allograft. Centrifuge isolated cell suspension at 300 x g for 5 min.   Perform the following step on ice. Remove media and resuspend cell pellet in Matrigel to a volume of 10 μl per 1 x 106 cells. Keep cell:Matrigel mixture on ice until engraftment.  Note: Thoroughly mix cell:Matrigel prior to engraftment.      Engraftment of Myc-CaP cells into anterior prostate of > 10 weeks male FVB/N mice   Perform engraftment in a laminar flow hood using aseptic techniques, as per your institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) guidelines. Wear a mask, cap, clean lab coat, arm covers, and sterile gloves throughout the procedure.",
    "Sterilize instruments using a glass bead sterilizer, and disinfect with 70% ethanol between animals.    Induce general anesthesia using a 2 L induction chamber by inhalation of 2% isoflurane in oxygen. Following complete anesthesia induction, maintain anesthesia by nose cone at approximately 1.5% isoflurane, adjusted as needed to maintain a deep plane of anesthesia (Figure 1). The level of anesthesia is sufficient for surgery when pinching of the skin between the digits does not stimulate pedal withdrawal.    Provide preemptive analgesia according to your institutional guidelines.  Note: As per our institutionally approved animal protocol, we inject mice subcutaneously with 5 mg/kg Carprofen diluted in sterile saline to a total volume of 0.5 ml.   Place the anesthetized mouse in dorsal recumbency, shave hair over the surgical site, and swab the surgical site with Betadine followed by 70% alcohol wipes (Figure 1).   Using sterile scissors and fine forceps, make a horizontal incision 1 cm in length at 2 mm above the preputial gland (Figure 1, and Bertrand et al., 2016). Once the abdominal wall is exposed, make a similar incision to open the abdomen (Figure 1).    Use fine forceps to manipulate the bladder gently out of the abdomen and caudally toward the prepuce. This exposes the seminal vesicles and attached anterior prostate lobes (Figure 1, and Oliveira et al., 2016). Gently coax one seminal vesicle and anterior prostate out of the abdomen with fine forceps, cotton swabs, or gentle pressure on the abdomen (Figure 1). Take special care to prevent damage to the seminal vesicles, as leakage of seminal fluid into the abdomen will incite an intense inflammatory reaction.",
    "After exposing and exteriorizing the seminal vesicle, insert a 25 µl Hamilton syringe preloaded with the Myc-CaP cell:Matrigel mixture and fitted with a 30 G ½” needle longitudinally into the anterior prostate (parallel to the length of the seminal vesicle). Slowly inject 10 μl of the mixture (equal to 1 x 106 Myc-CaP cells) into the prostate (Figure 1). Take care to avoid spillage of the injected contents when removing the needle from the anterior prostate as spillage may result in the seeding of multiple tumors in the abdomen. To avoid spillage, keep the needle in place for 1-2 sec after injection (giving the Matrigel time to solidify within the lobe) and apply gentle pressure to the injection site with a cotton swab after removing the needle.  Note: Injecting more than 10 μl into the anterior lobe increases the likelihood of spillage. Other lobes of the mouse prostate can be used for injection, however, the anterior lobe offers ease of location and a reduced likelihood of urethra constriction upon growth. Lobe choice for engraftment site should remain consistent throughout the experiment.    Gently return the seminal vesicle and bladder to the abdomen and then close the abdominal wall with 3-0 continuous, absorbable sutures. Close skin with 9 mm steel wound clips (Figure 1).  Note: For blinded studies, mark animals with toe tattoo or ear punch as per institutional guidelines. Give each animal a unique number for identification.   imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170212/20170212195856_0973.jpg Figure 1.

Following induction of general anesthesia (step B2), the surgical site is shaved and cleaned with Betadine followed by alcohol wipes (step B4).

    "Myc-CaP cells are injected into the anterior prostate (step B7), and then the incision is closed with sutures and surgical clips (step B8); B. Anatomic approximation of preputial glands (P.G., dotted lines) and incision site (solid horizontal black line). Scrotum (S) and prepuce (P) are labeled for reference; C. Organ anatomy of mouse at the incision site. Bladder (B, shown emptied of urine) and seminal vesicles (S.V., left-sided exposed only) are easily identified at the incision site for their midline location and white horn-shaped structure, respectively. The anterior prostate (A.P.) lobes run parallel to the seminal vesicles attached along their lesser curvature. D. Enlarged view of Myc-CaP cell injection into the anterior prostate.      Post-operative care   After surgical site closure, place animal in a clean cage on a disinfected heating pad to maintain body temperature during recovery.   Mice should be active and alert within 2 h of surgery. Monitor mice intermittently until they are alert.   Monitor mice daily for signs of distress or infection such as failure to groom, weight loss, reluctance to move, labored breathing.    If animals show signs of pain or distress, administer 5 mg/kg Carprofen subcutaneously every 12 h up to 72 h postoperatively.      Necropsy, processing and staining   Length of engraftment depends upon experimental design and endpoints.  Note: In our experience, engraftment of 1 x 106 Myc-CaP cells into the anterior prostate yields allografts approximately 60 mm3 in size and micro-metastatic disease at 21 days post engraftment (Hurley et al., 2015). Micro-metastatic disease is often difficult to appreciate grossly.  Following engraftment, euthanize mice according to your institutional guidelines for necropsy. Dissect the primary tumor away from the seminal vesicle and weigh it. If the engrafted tumor cannot be dissected from the adjacent seminal vesicle, remove the tumor along with the seminal vesicle and weigh en bloc.",
    "Inspect mice for gross evidence of metastatic disease and, if present, quantify the number and location of visible macro-metastatic lesions. Photograph both the engrafted lesion and any macro-metastatic lesions.   Remove the abdominal organs for formalin-fixation and paraffin embedding. Section organs for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining (Slaoui and Fiette, 2011). Additionally, remove the lungs and inflate with formalin for optimal pathological examination prior to formalin fixation. To inflate the lungs, a 21 G needle attached to a 3 ml syringe filled with fixative is introduced into the trachea at its open end, forceps are used to clamp gently around the needle, and fixative is introduced until excess refluxes up the trachea (Fiette and Slaoui, 2011). A certified pathologist should analyze H&E stained slides for micro-metastatic disease.    The presence of Myc-CaP cells in metastases can be confirmed via immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue for androgen receptor (AR) and Myc positivity (Figure 2). IHC staining protocol was adapted from a previously published study (Simons et al., 2015).   imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170212/20170212200123_7671.jpg Figure 2.
