    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis section describes the specific steps for conducting MRI-PDFF to measure intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) content in adults with NAFLD. The protocol can be repeated sequentially and used in weight loss trials.\nMRI-PDFF scanning procedure\nTiming: Approximately 30 min for 1 participant\nPre-scan - Participant safety and monitoring.\nThe MRI protocol should be conducted by a trained technician or radiologist.\nUse universal MRI safety precautions. Make sure that the participant does not have any large ferrous metal objects on or inside of them such as shrapnel, a metal fragment in the eye, aneurysm clips, ear implants, spinal nerve stimulators, permanent makeup, or a pacemaker.\nEnsure the participant has removed their dentures as well as any hair clips, earrings, necklaces, etc.\nProvide the participant with hearing protection.\nUse standard local practice for monitoring the participant during the scan. These may include MRI safety devices to monitor pulse and oxygen levels.\nRemove all upper body clothing with metallic trim, such as zippers, buttons or embroideries that may cause artifacts in the MRI images.\nParticipant positioning in the MRI scanner.\nCritical: Proper participant positioning is crucial for successful reproduction of serial MRI exams during long-term intervention trials. Therefore, it is important that each participant is positioned in the same manner for each MRI exam.\nEnsure each participant is wearing ear protection.\nAdd supports under the back and/or legs to help decrease strain on the knees and back as well as assisting in the stabilization of motion in the lower body.\nOffer each participant a panic button in case of emergencies or claustrophobia, if common local practice at your facility.\nPlace a phased array, flexible torso coil on the abdomen, directly over the liver.",
    "Remind participant to hold as still as possible and advance the participant to the isocenter of the scanning bore.\nMRI-PDFF data acquisition.\nRegister the participant in the MRI scanning control system.\nCheck that the body and coil are in the right position.\nInstruct younger healthier participant to suspend respiration for approximately 20 s at the end of inspiration during the MRI sequence acquisition.\nNote: If younger participants are having difficulties holding their breath for the full 20 s, please refer to troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: Problem 1.\nInstruct older (and/or less healthy) individuals to suspend respiration for approximately 10 s at the end of inspiration during the MRI sequence acquisition, as 20 s may be too difficult for these individuals.\nAcquire fat-water separation images of the liver using a T1 volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination (VIBE) Dixon sequence. Use these parameter settings:\nEcho time 1 (TE1) = 2.5 ms.\nEcho time 2 (TE2) = 3.7 ms.\nRepetition time = 5.47 ms.\nFlip angle = 5°.\nSlice thickness = 3.0 mm.\nSlice number = 2–3.\nMRI-PDFF data analysis.\nCalculate the fat content of the liver. Use region of interests (ROIs) covering the entire liver in 2–3 consecutive slices for each participant.\nGenerate MRI-PDFF maps for all segments by placing circular ROIs with diameter of 20 mm centrally in each of the liver segments.\nCalculate the intrahepatic triglyceride content values for 2–3 representative slices using vendor’s built-in software. The fat fraction map will be available directly from the scanner.\nRecord and save all the data acquired."
