    "This procedure is in accordance with the UK Home Office Regulations (Animal Scientific Procedures Act, 1986). Scientists should follow the guidelines established and approved by their institutional and national animal regulatory organizations.\n1. Dissection and Dissociation of Rat RMS Neuroblasts\nPrepare the solutions required for RMS dissection and dissociation:\nDissection medium (100 ml)\nHank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) - 98.5 ml\n5 M HEPES pH 7.4 - 0.5 ml\nPenicillin-streptomycin (10,000 units/ml and 10,000 µg/ml) - 1 ml\nDissociation medium (2 ml)\nHBSS - 1.760 ml\n10x Trypsin (2.5%) - 200 µl\nDNAse1 (1 mg/ml) - 40 µl\nDulbecco Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) + 10% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS) (40 ml)\nDMEM - 36 ml\nFCS - 4 ml\nComplete medium (12 ml)\nNeurobasal medium - 11.46 ml\nB27 Supplement - 250 µl\nL-Glutamine (200 mM) - 125 µl\nGlucose (45%) - 165 µl\n2. Filter-sterilize the DMEM + 10% FCS and the complete medium and preequilibrate them in a 37 °C /5% CO2 incubator.\nDissection\n\t\nSacrifice a P6-P7 rat litter (about 12 pups) by cervical dislocation and decapitate with scissors.\nMake an anteroposterior incision in the skin along the mid-sagittal suture from the nose to the cerebellum with a scalpel blade. Peel the skin off and repeat the same incision along the skull.\nGently remove the cranial flaps with forceps and carefully remove the brain with a spatula, taking care to include the olfactory bulbs.\nCut the most caudal third of the brain and discard it.\nChop the brain tissue into 1.4 mm thick coronal slices using a tissue chopper.\nPlace slices in dishes containing cold dissection medium and carefully separate them using a needle.",
    "The RMS appears as a triangular, translucent area in the centre of OB sections and as a small, circular area in more caudal brain slices. Cut the RMS out of each slice with a microsurgical knife, taking care to avoid including surrounding tissue. In P7 rat pups, usually the ~8 most rostral slices (including OB) contain the RMS.\nCollect the RMS fragments with a plastic Pasteur pipette and place them in a small dish containing cold dissection medium on ice.\nWhen the dissection is complete, transfer the RMS fragments into a 15 ml tube with a plastic pipette. Leave fragments to settle at the bottom of the tube.\nDissociation\n\t\nReplace the dissection medium with 2 ml of dissociation medium.\nTriturate the RMS fragments by gently pipetting the fragment suspension up and down about 10x using a P1000 pipette.\nLeave the tube with the tissue fragments in a 37 °C water bath for 2 min.\nPipette the solution again 10x and ensure that fragments have dissociated (the suspension should become cloudy).\nInactivate the trypsin by adding 5 ml of prewarmed DMEM + 10% FCS.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 433 x g for 5 min.\nIn the meantime aliquot the required amount of siRNA/DNA into Eppendorf tubes (usually 3-5 µg DNA/shRNA or 5-9 µg siRNA oligo per nucleofection, however the amount of DNA/siRNA may require optimization).\nRemove excess medium and resuspend the cell pellet by gentle pipetting in 5 ml of prewarmed DMEM + 10% FCS.\nPerform a cell count. Expect ~1 x 106 cells per rat pup brain. A minimum of 2.5 x 106 cells are required for each nucleofection, while optimal results are achieved using 3-4 x 106 cells per nucleofection.",
    "Centrifuge the cell suspension at 433 x g for 5 min. Make sure to remove as much medium as possible.\n2. Nucleofection\nImmediately resuspend the cell pellet in rat (or mouse if using mouse cells) neuron nucleofection solution previously incubated at room temperature. Use 100 µl per nucleofection. Note: typically a rat litter of 12 pups is sufficient to perform 4 nucleofections and a mouse litter (12 pups) is sufficient to perform 2 nucleofections.\nTransfer 100 µl of the cell suspension to each Eppendorf tube containing siRNA/DNA and mix gently 2-3x by pipetting with a P200 pipette.\nAdd the sample (cell-DNA/siRNA suspension) to the bottom of the nucleofectioncuvette, taking care to avoid bubbles.\nNucleofect using program G-013 (for rat cells) or O-005 (for mouse cells). One nucleofection takes approximately 5 sec.\nQuickly add 1 ml of prewarmed DMEM + 10% FCS to the nucleofected sample.\nRepeat steps 2.4 and 2.5 for all other samples. Note: for optimal results, the entire nucleofection procedure should last no longer than 5 min.\nTransfer each sample to a 15 ml tube containing 5 ml of prewarmed DMEM + 10% FCS using the plastic pipette provided by the nucleofection kit. Avoid transferring any cellular debris to the tube.\nCentrifuge samples at 433 x g for 5 min.\nCarefully remove all excess medium and resuspend the pellet in 25-30 µl of prewarmed DMEM + 10% FCS using a P20 pipette. Do not use more than 30 µl of medium.\nPipette the suspension as a drop onto the inner side of a p35 dish lid.\nInvert the lid over the p35 dish containing 2 ml of complete medium (see also Figure 1).",
    "Leave in the incubator (37 °C/5% CO2) for at least 5 hr and up to 7 hr. Longer incubation time allows better reaggregation of cell clusters.\nTransfer the hanging drops from the lid into the complete medium in the dish using a P1000 pipette with a cut tip.\nIncubate at 37 °C/5% CO2 for 24 hr for DNA nucleofections and 48 hr for siRNA/ shRNA nucleofections.\n3. Embedding\nPrepare complete medium (25 ml) and preequilibrate it at 37 °C/5% CO2 for a few hours.\nTake out the frozen aliquots of basement membrane matrix from -80 °C freezer and thaw on ice in the cold room.\nFor each nucleofection prepare a 6 cm dish containing up to eight 13 mm sterile coverlips.\nPlace the dishes on an ice box covered with cling film. It is important to keep the coverslips cool to prevent matrix solidification during the embedding procedure.\nTo maintain humidity, place a strip of damp tissue inside a 15 cm dish that will be used to hold up to three 6 cm dishes containing the embedded neuroblasts.\nAdd complete medium to the thawed matrix in a 1:3 ratio. For example, mix 40 µl of complete medium with 120 µl of matrix by pipetting. This amount of matrix is sufficient for embedding aggregates on eight 12 mm coverslips.\nTransfer the reaggregated cell clusters to a 15 ml tube and centrifuge at 433 x g for 5 min.\nRemove excess medium and resuspend the pellet in 10 µl of complete medium.\nPlace 2 µl of cell aggregate suspension onto each sterile coverslip and add 18 µl of matrix/complete medium mixture. Use the pipette tip to spread the matrix over the entire coverslip.",
    "Immediately place the 6 cm dish containing the coverslips in the 15 cm dish and leave in the incubator (37°C /5% CO2) for 15-20 min. When the matrix has solidified, gently add 5 ml complete medium to each 6 cm dish taking care to push down any floating coverslip with a pipette tip.\nIncubate for 24 hr at 37 °C /5% CO2 to let neuroblasts migrate out of the cell aggregates.\n4. 3D Migration Assay\nPrepare the solutions required for immunostaining.\n\t\nPrepare the block solution:\nGoat block solution (50 ml)\n\t\tPhosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) - 5 ml\n\t\tGoat serum - 7.5 ml\n\t\t10% Triton X-100 - 1.5 ml\n\t\tBSA - 50 mg\n\t\tH2O - 36 ml\nFilter and store at 4 °C.\nPrepare the fixing solution:\nFixing solution (100 ml)\n\t\tParaformaldehyde (PFA) - 4 g CAUTION: always handle PFA under a hood\n\t\tSucrose - 20 g (optional)\n\t\tPBS up to 100 ml\nOn a hot plate and under constant stirring dissolve the PFA in 80 ml PBS maintained at 65 °C.\nOnce the PFA has dissolved, add 20 g of sucrose.\nAdjust pH to 7.4 (usually by adding ~60 µl 1 M NaOH per 100 ml of solution).\nBring up to a total volume of 100 ml with PBS.\nImmunostaining\n\t\nPlace coverslips in a 24-well plate.\nRinse coverslips with PBS 2x.\nFix the RMS neuroblast aggregates with fixing solution for 45 min at room temperature.\nRinse coverslips with PBS 3x (5 min/wash - on a rocking platform).\nBlock for 30-60 min with goat block solution.\nDilute primary antibodies in goat block solution and incubate overnight at 4 °C. (If desired, fluorescent phalloidin (1:400) and Hoechst dye (1:10,000) can also be added to the primary antibody solution to visualize filamentous actin and nuclei).\nRinse coverslips with PBS 3x (5 min/wash).",
    "Dilute secondary antibodies in goat block solution and incubate for 2 hr at room temperature.\nRinse coverslips with PBS 3x (5 min/wash)\nMount coverslips with fluorescent mounting medium and leave to dry overnight at room temperature.\nMigration Analysis\n\t\nCapture images of fixed RMS neuroblast aggregates with a fluorescent microscope using a 10X objective. Include a scale bar in a sample image.\nTo set up the scale for quantification, measure the scale bar in the image by selecting the 'Straight line' tool on the ImageJ tool bar.\nChoose the 'Analyze' option and click on 'set the scale'.\nIn the scale window set the 'known distance' and tick the 'global' box to keep the same settings for all measurements.\nUse the 'Segmented line' tool on the ImageJ tool bar to measure the distance from the edge of the aggregate to the furthest migrated neuroblast in 6 different sectors around the entire aggregate (Figure 3B). Consider only isolated aggregates for analysis.\nCalculate an average migration distance from the 6 values obtained for each aggregate.\nMeasure 10-20 aggregates for each condition in every independent experiment and pool results from a minimum of three independent experiments. Always include a nucleofection control (e.g. GFP or a control sh/siRNA)."
