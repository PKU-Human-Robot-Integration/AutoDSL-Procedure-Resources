    "1. Preparation of Stock Solutions Under a Culture Hood\nPrepare 400 mL of 1x Schneider Active Medium (SAM) optimized for ex vivo culture of larval brains (modified from reference24,25) (Table 1). Aliquot to 5 mL and flash freeze in liquid nitrogen (LN2), store at - 80 °C.\nPrepare 1x Dissecting Saline Solution (DSS) by diluting 10x stock solution (modified from reference26) (Table 2).\nAliquot fibrinogen to 10 mg and store at 4 °C for a single use.\n\tCaution: Weigh fibrinogen under laminar flow, wearing gloves, as it is harmful.\nPrepare thrombin stock solution in SAM (1500 NIH unit/mg) and aliquot to 10 µL, flash freeze in LN2 and keep at -80 °C.\n\tCaution: Wear gloves when handling thrombin as it is harmful.\nAliquot stock solution of 100x Penicillin-Streptomycin. Keep at -20 °C.\nCut circles of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane (see Materials Table) to the size that fits the inside of a glass bottom dish. Rinse them in 70% EtOH and then in autoclaved dH2O. Sterilize and dry under laminar flow with UV. Keep in a sterile Petri dish. Single use.\n\tNOTE: PTFE is a porous flexible membrane that allows gas exchange and prevents medium from evaporating during long-term recording.\n2. Time-lapse Microscopy Setup\nNOTE: The following setup is for a tandem scanner inverted confocal microscope (see Materials Table) equipped with a resonant scanner (8,000 Hz). The system includes a highly sensitive photo-multiplier detector, which together with the resonant scanner prevents phototoxicity and photobleaching. Temperature and humidity are controlled within a microscope environmental chamber (see Materials Table) that covers most of the microscope.\nPlace a stage-top humidity chamber.\nTurn on the temperature and humidity controllers to equilibrate the microscope chamber to 25 °C and 80% humidity.",
    "To perform experiments in constant darkness (DD), cover the microscope environmental chamber with an opaque cloth (unless the microscope chamber is made of an opaque material).\nIf using a water-immersion objective, position a Water Immersion Micro Dispenser on top of the objective and program a protocol with the Autoimmersion Objective Controller software to dispense water at a constant rate during time-lapse imaging.\n\tNOTE: Water-immersion objectives together with a water dispenser or dry objective lens are recommended for long-term live imaging, as other type of immersion medium would dry out.\nPlace a Petri dish holder on the stage, inside of the humidity chamber.\nLaunch the microscope software and select the resonant scanner mode from the first dialogue box. Select OK to initialize the stage when prompted. Go to Configuration tab and to Hardware configuration to switch on the relevant laser lines.\nGo to Acquire tab and to XY panel to select bidirectional mode and set image acquisition parameters.\n\tNOTE: The described imaging setup presented here (Figure 2, Figure 3 and Movie 1) is optimized to observe circadian expression of specific fluorescent reporters. The following parameters were chosen to best fit our specifications: 40X water immersion objective, 8X line average with 512 × 512 image resolution. For multicolor imaging, sequential image acquisition is required when the emission wavelength of one fluorophore and the excitation wavelength of another overlap (here, wavelengths of Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP) emission and Tomato excitation overlap). Choose the sequential mode \"in between stack\" as it is the fastest and the movement of clock neurons is negligible during the acquisition of a Z-stack. Microscopy settings should be adapted to suit the aim of each experiment.\n3. Setup of Larval Brain Explant Culture\nNOTE: The whole procedure from dissection to embedding of brain explants takes ~30 min.",
    "Preparation of reagents under a culture hood.\nThaw an aliquot of thrombin and keep at room temperature until the embedding step (step 3.3). Single use.\nThaw quickly an aliquot of SAM at 37 °C and keep on ice for a single use.\nAdd SAM to a 10 mg aliquot of fibrinogen to 10 mg/mL, flick gently and incubate at 37 °C for at least 30 min and during the embedding step (step 3.3). Single use.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not incubate the fibrinogen solution more than 2 h as it starts to polymerize.\nThaw an aliquot of 100x stock Penicillin-Streptomycin. Prepare 2.5 mL of SAM containing 1x Penicillin-Streptomycin (SAM/antibiotics). Keep at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: Store the remaining 100x stock Penicillin-Streptomycin at 4 °C up to 1 month.\nPrepare an aliquot of 500 µL from the remaining SAM. Keep on ice.\nFor long-term imaging, apply autoclaved vacuum grease to the plastic part of the bottom of the glass bottom dish (Figure 1A) and sterilize under laminar flow with UV.\nDissection of the central nervous system and ventral nerve cord.\nClean the forceps and 2 x three-well glass dissection dishes with 70% EtOH. Pour 400 µL of DSS into 4 wells and 400 µL of SAM in one well. Keep on ice.\nScoop out fly medium containing larvae and pick non-wandering 3rd instar larvae (L3) with forceps. Rinse them successively in 2 DSS-filled wells. Keep them in the 3rd DSS-filled well on ice that anesthetizes the larvae.",
    "NOTE: L3 lasts approximately 2 days at 25 °C. To observe the brain in physiologically relevant timeframe we chose to use non-wandering L3 larvae. Other subgroups of clock neurons, such as l-LNvs and DN3s, start to be formed at wandering L3 stage but they are not necessarily cycling yet (data not shown). Therefore, although it is possible to image cycling clock neurons at this stage (data not shown), it is important to carefully distinguish the already functional larval clock neurons from developing ones for data analysis. Non-wandering L3 appear approximately 4 to 4.5 days after egg laying at 25 °C. To use this protocol for studying circadian rhythms, synchronize (entrain) the developing larvae in 12 h/12 h LD cycles at 25 °C for 3 days before collecting L3 larvae.\nDissect larval brains with fine forceps in the 4th DSS-filled well, which has not been used for rinsing larvae, using the inside-out method27.\n\t\t\nBriefly, cut the larva in two, gently pinch the mouth hooks with a pair of forceps and roll up inside-out the body wall using the other pair of forceps, thus exposing the brain. Free the brain by cutting out all the trachea and nerves that attach it to the rest of the body.\nAspirate the brain in about 3 µL of DSS with a 20 µL pipette (pre-rinsed with DSS) and dispense in the SAM-filled well. Repeat the procedure for up to 7 brains.",
    "NOTE: Dissection should be performed on a cold surface to keep the larvae anesthetized and the brain chilled. For example, place the dissection dish on a cooling block connected to a pump to circulate ice-chilled water. The dissection procedure takes ~30 s per brain. It is important to keep the eye/antennal imaginal discs attached to the brains and the ventral nerve cord intact. Tearing off these parts will damage the brain and reduce the quality of the culture. Also, avoid exposing the brains to the air. Before aspirating the first brain, pipette up and down the DSS containing parts of the dissected larvae, as it prevents the brains from sticking to the wall of the tip.\nEmbedding of brain explants in a 3D matrix and mounting (~20 min).\nSubmerge a dissected brain in fibrinogen working solution (fibrinogen final concentration ~3.3 mg/mL, 10.5 µL per brain) as follows:\nAspirate 3.5 µL of SAM/antibiotics (with the same tip used in section 3.2.3). Aspirate a dissected brain from the dissection well into the same pipette tip without dispensing the SAM/antibiotics medium in the tip.\nDispense the brain and the medium on the lid of a sterile Petri dish. Add another 3.5 µL of SAM/antibiotics and 3.5 µL of warm fibrinogen/SAM 10 mg/mL solution on the drop containing the brain. Mix the solution around the brain gently by pipetting with a 20 µL pipette tip.\n\t\tNOTE: Using a pipette rather than forceps in this step avoids stressing the brain.\nTake 2 µL of the fibrinogen working solution from the drop and apply it on the coverslip of the glass bottom dish as a small circle. Add 0.8 µL of thrombin and mix very quickly with a pipette tip. The fibrinogen is converted to fibrin and starts to polymerize.",
    "Take the brain that sits in the fibrinogen working solution (step 3.3.1) between a pair of forceps and position it on the matrix once a white matrix of fibrin is visible. Orient the brain anterior side down (for imaging clock neurons). Push it down as close as possible to the cover glass. Fibrin clot is composed of layers of fibrin. Pick one layer and fold it on top of the brain with small and gentle movements without detaching the matrix.\n\t\t\nRepeat 2 to 3 times from different parts of the clot to stabilize the brain.\n\t\t\tNOTE: When handling the brain with forceps, be careful not to dry it or impose it a physical stress.\nAdd 20 µL of SAM/antibiotics on top of the embedded brain to stop the action of thrombin.\nRepeat the procedure to mount the remaining brains. It is possible to embed up to 5 to 6 brains on a glass bottom dish.\nFor long-term live imaging, add 600 µL of SAM/antibiotics in the inner well (the glass part). Position a pre-cut PTFE membrane on top of the medium and stick it to the vacuum grease applied on the plastic part of the bottom (3.1.5) (Figure 1A).\nFor pharmacological assays, fill the dish with 2 mL of SAM/antibiotics (Figure 1B).\n\t\tNOTE: It is very important to avoid evaporation of the medium, as the osmolality of the medium is critical to the viability of neurons. Therefore, for long-term imaging experiments, it is necessary to seal the culture dish with PTFE membrane. Whereas for short-term experiments, sealing membrane is not required as long as the dish is filled with 2 mL of medium and monitored in a humidified chamber.\n4. Time-lapse Image Acquisition\nPlace the glass bottom dish on the Petri dish holder inside the stage-top humidity chamber.",
    "Go to z-stack panel in the Acquire tab and set the z-section steps from the microscope software (2 µm × ~40 in the experiments shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3, and Movie 1). Set the beginning of a z-stack at the plane farthest from the coverslip and the end at the surface of the brain explant, close to the coverslip. Though brain movements are negligible, add extra z-sections at the beginning and end of the z-stack.\nGo to Mark & Find panel and set-up multi-position image acquisition. With a 40X objective, 1 brain hemisphere can be captured within a field of view\nGo to Acquisition mode panel and select xyzt (z-stack time-lapse). Go to Time Acquisition panel and set the preferred time interval and frequency parameters.\n\tNOTE: Acquire time-lapse images with desired frequency. Note that long-term live imaging (24-72 h) with time lapse interval shorter than 2 h tends to results in fewer cycling neurons, probably because it reduces the viability of neurons. The data volume expands as the rate of image acquisition increases, which makes data analysis and storage more challenging.\n5. Pharmacological Treatment of brain Explants with Short-term Live Imaging\nNOTE: The following procedure is essentially the same as that for long-term imaging but does not require a PTFE membrane. To avoid exposing the brains to blue light when the chemical is added to the culture, the microscope should be placed in the dark room with red light.\nGo to Time Acquisition panel and set the desired time interval and number of scan to obtain the baseline data before drug application. Start Scan.",
    "After the baseline scan is completed, lift the scan head of the microscope system. Remove the lid of the stage-top humidity controller and very carefully remove the lid of the glass bottom dish without moving it.\nRemove the appropriate amount of culture medium if necessary. Add the experimental solution in the medium and, carefully and very gently, mix with a sterile Pasteur pipette without touching the brain explants.\n\tNOTE: For bath application of PDF, use 2 µM PDF stock solution (in 10% DMSO).\nReplace the lids of the glass bottom dish and the humid chamber, and the scan head. If using, reposition the black opaque cloth around the microscope chamber.\nCheck if the brains are at their original positions in live scan mode. Adjust if necessary.\nGo to Time Acquisition panel and set the desired time interval and number of scan. Start Scan.\n\tNOTE: Here we tested time-lapse images acquired every hour for up to 10 h.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
