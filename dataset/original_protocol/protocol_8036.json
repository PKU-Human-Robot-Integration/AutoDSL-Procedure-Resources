Use a spectrophotometer to verify that the concentration of mRNA is more than 100 ng/µL and the ratio of absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm is about 2.0.\nPreparation of demembranated Xenopus laevis sperm DNA\n\tNOTE: Adapted from Murray 19911.",
    "Euthanize adult male Xenopus laevis25 and dissect testes from four male frogs26,27.\nPlace testes from four frogs in the same 100 mL Petri dish. Rinse the testes three times in 50 mL of cold 1x MMR solution (0.1 M NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM of MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, 5 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM EDTA).\nRemove excess blood and fat from the testes in a 100 mL petri dish and then wash twice in cold nuclear preparation buffer (NPB) (250 mM sucrose, 15 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.5 mM spermidine trihydrochloride, 0.2 mM spermine tetrahydrochloride).\nRemove the nuclear preparation buffer (NPB) and cut testes into pieces with lengths smaller than 0.2 cm using sharp dissecting scissors in a 100 mL Petri dish. Add 8 mL of cold NPB to the testes for further breakdown.\nUse nylon mesh fabrics with a pore size of 70 µm to filter the testes and collect sperm sample into a 15 mL conical tube. Spin down the collected sperms at 1,730 x g for 10 minutes at 4 °C and remove supernatant.\nSupply the sperm cells with 1 mL of NPB and 50 µL of 10 mg/mL lysolecithin and incubate at room temperature for 5 min to demembranate sperm cells.\nWash the demembranated sperm DNA with 10 mL of cold NPB with 3% BSA solution three times.\nMeasure the density of sperm DNA with a hemocytometer.\nFreeze the sperm DNA in 5 µL aliquots in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C. The optimal concentration of sperm DNA is approximately 105 nuclei/µL.\nProtein purification of GFP-Nuclear Localization Signal (GFP-NLS)\nTransform the GST-tagged GFP-NLS plasmid into BL21 (DE3) competent E. coli cells5.",
    "Incubate the cells without antibiotics at 37 °C for 1 h and then spread on a LB agarose plate with 100 µg/mL ampicillin.\nIncubate the plate at 37 °C for 14 to 18 hours to grow the cells into single colonies. Pick and inoculate single colonies into 4 mL of LB media with 100 µg/mL ampicillin. Shake the cells at 37 °C for 12 hours.\nPrepare the autoclaved YT media (16 g of Bacto-tryptone, 10 g of Bacto-yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl) and heat the YT media to 37 °C.\nInoculate 1 mL of the overnight incubated cells in LB media into 250 mL of preheated YT media with 100 µg/mL ampicillin and shake for 2 hours to increase cell density.\nMeasure cell optical density (OD) every 30 minutes, using a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 600 nm. Add 0.1 mM IPTG into cells to induce GFP-NLS protein expression once the OD value reaches 0.1.\nShake the cells at 18 °C overnight to reduce cell growth rate and allow better protein expression and synthesis.\nSpin down the cells at 34,524 x g at 4 °C for 5 minutes and remove supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellets in 40 mL of PBS buffer (supplied with 800 µL of 50 mg/mL lysozyme, 100 µL of 0.2 M PMSF, 13.2 µL of a 10 mg/mL mix of leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymostatin, and 8 µL of 0.5 M EDTA) and incubate at 4 °C for 20 minutes.\nBreak down cells using a sonicator at a frequency of 20 kHz for 4 x 30 s, with 30 s intervals between each sonication, to release expressed GFP-NLS protein.\nSpin at 20,000 x g for 35 minutes to remove the broken cells.\nUse affinity chromatography to extract and purify GFP-NLS protein.",
    "Wash the 1.5 mL bead slurry three times with 15 mL of PBS buffer and incubate 250 mL of lysate with beads for 4 hours at 4 °C with inversion.\nSpin down the beads at 2000 x g for 5 min and add 10 mL of wash solution (25 mM Tris base, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, and 5 mM DTT) to beads. Incubate beads in 700 µL of elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 20 mM reduced glutathione, and 5 mM DTT) with rotation at 4 °C. Collect an aliquot of the elution with a volume of 50 µL.\nMeasure the concentration of collected protein by running a Coomassie blue gel28.\nElute the proteins using PD-10 columns with 3 mL of storage buffer (20 mM HEPES, 150 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.7) through buffer exchange.\n2. Preparation of Cycling Xenopus Extracts\nNOTE: The overall procedure of preparing the extracts is illustrated in Figure 1A. Adapted from Murray 19911.\nInject three mature female Xenopus laevis with 66 IU pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) 10 days before laying eggs.\nInject these Xenopus frogs with 500 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) to induce egg laying 18 hours before the preparation of cycling extracts.\nDiscard laid eggs overnight. Based on experiments (data not shown), extracts prepared from the freshly squeezed eggs generate longer-lasting activities than extracts prepared from laid eggs from the same female frog. Squeeze the eggs of each female frog into 100 mm Petri dishes containing 10 mL of 0.2x MMR buffer and inspect under a stereo microscope.\nDiscard the batches of eggs that have unclear boundaries between animal and vegetal poles or have irregular white spots on top of animal poles.",
    "Choose the batch of eggs from one female frog presenting a homogeneous population of eggs with clearly differentiated animal and vegetal poles and transfer the eggs into a 600 mL beaker.\nPour out excess 0.2x MMR buffer and gently add 250 mL of 2 g per 100 mL cysteine (pH 7.7) in 1x extract buffer (100 mM KCl, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 50 mM sucrose, pH 7.7) to eggs.\nShake the eggs vigorously by hand and remove the jelly coats of eggs over three washes with a total volume of 800 mL of cysteine buffer for 3 minutes or until eggs aggregate and settle at the bottom of the beaker, indicating that jelly coat removal is successful.\nWash eggs with 1 L of 0.2x MMR solution over four times.\nPick and discard eggs that turn white using a glass transfer pipette.\nPour out the MMR buffer and supply eggs with 200 mL of 0.1 µg/mL calcium ionophore A23187 solution in 0.2x MMR buffer for activation.\nUse the wide opening side of a glass pipette to stir the eggs gently until the eggs are activated and remove calcium ionophore solution.\nCheck the activation efficiency after eggs settle down at the bottom of the beaker. Well-activated eggs have approximately 25% of the animal pole and 75% of the vegetal pole.\nWash the activated eggs twice with 50 mL of 1x extract buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (10 µg/mL each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymostatin).\nCarefully transfer eggs to a 0.4 mL snap-cap microtube and then pack eggs through centrifugation at 200 x g for 60 seconds, and then 600 x g for 30 seconds.\nRemove extra buffer on the top of eggs using a glass Pasteur pipette to reduce the dilution of extracts.",
    "Crush eggs at 15,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4 °C.\nCut the tubes with a razor blade to separate three layers of crushed eggs and keep the crude cytoplasm in the middle layer.\nTransfer the crude cytoplasm into new ultracentrifuge tubes, and supplement with protease inhibitors and cytochalasin B at 10 µg/mL each.\nCentrifuge the crude cytoplasm again at 15,000 x g at 4° C for 5 minutes to further purify cytoplasm by removing excess lipid and yolk.\nKeep freshly prepared extracts on ice.\n3. Droplet Generation\n2D glass chamber preparation\n\tNOTE: The rectangle glass tubes serve as chambers that confine the droplets in a single 2-dimensional plane, allowing for easier observation and data collection.\n\t\nCut rectangle glass tubes with an inner dimension of 2 mm x 100 µm into 4 mm long pieces. Use the sharp edge of a whetstone, mark the desired boundaries on the outer surface of the glass tube with light etchings, then gently apply pressure on both sides of the etchings to break off pieces of glass tubes.\nPre-heat a dry bath incubator to 95 °C. Take out the heating block and place it into a polycarbonate vacuum desiccator.\nPlace a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing 30 µL of trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane in the heating block. Lay the cut glass tubes inside the vacuum desiccator at approximately 5 cm to the heating block.\nConnect the desiccator to a vacuum pump. Turn on the pump for 1 minute to reach the desired vacuum level, then close the 3-way valve to seal the desiccator and let the trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane vapor coat the inner wall of the glass tubes. This will create a hydrophobic environment for stabilizing the droplets.\nLeave the glass tubes inside the desiccator for overnight coating. The tubes will be ready for use the next day.",
    "Droplet generation and imaging\n\tNOTE: The procedures of generating droplets and imaging are illustrated in Figures 1B and 1C.\n\t\nSupply extracts prepared in step 2 with 10 ng/µL securin-mCherry mRNA for the simple cytoplasmic-only cell cycle experiments. Alternatively, supply extracts with demembranated sperm chromatin (250 per µL of extract), 10 µM GFP-NLS protein, and 10 ng/µL securin-mCherry mRNA to create droplets exhibiting periodic nuclei morphology changes.\nIn a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, mix 20 µL of extract supplied with recombinant protein or mRNA with 200 µL of 2% perfluoropolyether-polyethylene glycol (PFPE-PEG) fluorosurfactant in HFE7500 fluorinated oil.\nGenerate droplets using a vortex mixer. The range of droplet sizes can be modulated by vortex speed and duration. To create droplets with radii ranging from 50 to 200 µm, set the vortex speed at 56 x g (3,200 rpm with a radius of 4.9 mm) and gently press the microcentrifuge tube containing the extract and surfactant mixture on the mixer for 3.5 seconds. Visually inspect if the droplets are uniform in size.\nUse a 20 µL pipette to transfer the droplets floating on top and an equal volume of PFPE-PEG surfactant into a PCR tube. Dip the glass tube prepared from step into the droplet layer in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and wait until droplets have filled approximately 75% of the tube, then push the tube down into the surfactant layer until the tube is completely filled. This will lower the droplet density and allow the droplets to form one single layer inside the chamber without overlapping or shape distortion caused by overcrowding.\nFill a glass bottom dish with a diameter of 40 mm with mineral oil. Immerse the droplet-filled tubes in oil by gently pushing them down using a fine tweezer.",
    "After loading all samples, use a glass pipette to remove any visible debris or leaked droplets. Add more mineral oil if the tubes are not or will not be completely immersed in the imaging process.\nConduct imaging of droplets on an epifluorescence microscope equipped with a motorized x-y stage (see Table of Materials). Use a 4X air objective for all imaging. For fluorescence imaging, use a 130 W mercury vapor short arc lamp as fluorescence light source for illumination, and a GFP filter set (excitation 482/35 nm and emission 514/LP nm) and an mCherry filter set (excitation 562/40 nm and emission 641/75 nm) for imaging GFP-NLS and securin-mCherry signals.\nRecord time-lapse videos in the bright field and multiple fluorescence channels every 6 to 9 minutes until the droplets lose their activity.\n4. Image Processing and Data Analysis\nSegmentation and tracking of droplets\nImport recorded data in the format of \".tif\" or \".oif\" into image analysis software (see Table of Materials).\nSegment single droplets using the bright field channel. The bright field image will show droplets as bright circles with dark boundaries. Apply thresholding to the image. Add a tracking surface to each droplet by tuning the threshold between dark and bright pixels so that each surface covers the whole area of the corresponding droplet.\nAutomatically track the segments between adjacent frames using the autoregressive motion algorithm. Tune the acceptable maximum traveling distance of a droplet between two adjacent frames to be smaller than the radius of most droplets to accurately track small droplets.\nVisually check all tracks across the entire video to detect incorrect segmentations that segment the empty space between droplets instead of actual droplets. Manually delete incorrect tracks.",
    "Segment and track background area without any droplets to obtain the background fluorescence intensity. To improve signal to noise, subtract background intensity from the fluorescence intensity of droplets at each time frame.\nExport measured parameters for each track over time, including the mean and standard deviation of the fluorescence intensity and the droplet area into \".csv\" files.\nData analysis of droplet size and oscillation period\nLoad the \".csv\" files into R to create plots of fluorescence intensity over time for each droplet. Record droplet ID into a \".csv\" file.\nImport the \".csv\" files exported from the analysis software and the \".csv\" file with a list of droplet ID into Matlab and save as \".mat\" files for further data analysis.\nCalculate the volume of a compressed droplet based on the exported droplet area information after segmentation and the height of glass chamber19. Use the volume to calculate the radius of droplet as a sphere.\nExtract the time points of peaks and troughs using peak/trough detection algorithm. Perform manual corrections on the position of peaks and troughs to ensure they are accurately detected.\nTo calculate the cell-cycle period, calculate the interval time between two adjacent peaks. Take the average of all intervals for each droplet as its cell-cycle period.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
