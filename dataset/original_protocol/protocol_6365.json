    "Preparation of Kinase-Glo® reagentMix the 10 ml Kinase Glo® Buffer with the lyophilized Kinase Glo® Substrate.Make sure that the dilution of the substrate powder is complete and the solution is clear.Aliquot the Kinase-Glo® reagent and store it at -20 °C until usage.Preparation of kinase assay solution 10xPrepare the kinase assay solution 10x as described in the Recipes, aliquot and store it at -20 °C until usage.Determination of the TbGSK-3s fraction with the highest enzymatic activityPerform the kinase assay for the different isolated fractions of the kinase (TbGSK-3s). The isolated fractions have been purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate (Ni-NTA) agarose according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen) with elutions of different imidazole concentrations (Fractions A, B, C and D using 50, 150, 250 and 400 nM imidazole respectively) as previously described (Efstathiou et al., 2019).Note: Isolated fractions of the TbGSK-3s were subsequently concentrated using Amicon® Ultra-4 Centrifugal Filters and rediluted in kinase assay solution 1x in order to remove excess imidazole from the samples. Imidazole in high concentrations could interfere during the kinase assay providing false results.Adjust the temperature of the water bath to 30 °C.Defreeze the Kinase-Glo® reagent from -20 °C to 4 °C.Defreeze the kinase assay solution 10x from -20 °C to 4 °C.Prepare master mix solution (containing a final concentration of 1x kinase assay solution, 10 μΜ ATP, 10 μΜ GSK-3 peptide substrate) as described below (final volume 40 μl per sample):4 μl x [number of samples] of 10x kinase assay solution1 μl x [number of samples] of 400 μΜ ATP1.2 μl x [number of samples] of 333 μΜ GSK-3 peptide substrate23.8 μl x [number of samples] of ddH2OMix well the master mix by pipetting up and down.Add 30 μl of the master mix in each Eppendorf.",
    "Add 10 μl of each TbGSK-3s isolated fraction (A, B, C and D fractions) in each tube.Make duplicates or triplicates for each fraction.Mix well the samples by pipetting up and down.Spin down the samples.Incubate the samples for 30 min in the water bath at 30 °C.Stop the reaction by adding 40 μl of cold Kinase-Glo® reagent (4 °C).Spin down the samples.Measure the luminescence in the GloMax® 20/20 Luminometer for 1 s.Note: Read the luminescence with the ‘ready to use’ Promega protocol named ‘Kinase-Glo’. Determine the elution fraction of TbGSK-3s with the optimal enzymatic activity (see Data analysis A).Use the kinase immediately for the kinases assays or store it in a 50% (v/v) glycerol stock at -80 °C.Notes:Purified elution fraction C of TbGSK-3s (initially eluted with 250 mM imidazole) was determined in our analysis as the one with higher enzymatic activity (see Data analysis A). It is recommended to use the kinase TbGSK-3s fractions immediately after the elution to ensure maximum activity. The 50% (v/v) glycerol stock of the kinase has diminished activity depending on the time period that it is stored at -80 °C and they should be used up to 3-5 days upon isolation to avoid complete loss of the kinase activity.Determination of the optimal protein kinase (TbGSK-3s) concentrationPerform the kinase assay with the appropriate elution fraction (elution fraction C) of TbGSK-3s which was identified above as the one with higher enzymatic activity.Follow Steps C2-C4.Prepare master mix solution (containing a final concentration of 1x kinase assay solution, 10 μΜ ATP, 10 μΜ GSK-3 peptide substrate) as described below (final volume 40 μl per sample):4 μl x [number of samples] of 10x kinase assay solution1 μl x [number of samples] of 400 μΜ ATP1.2 μl x [number of samples] of 333 μΜ GSK-3 peptide substrate23.",
    "8 μl x [number of samples] of ddH2OFollow Steps C6-C7.Add 10 μl of TbGSK-3s isolated fraction C in different concentrations (containing 0, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, 100 and 200 ng TbGSK-3s, diluted with ddH2O).Note: Different concentrations of kinase can be used if needed, depending on the parameters of the experiment. Follow Steps C9-C15.Determine the optimal concentration of TbGSK-3s for the kinase assays (see Data analysis B).Note: 40 ng of TbGSK-3s (Fraction C) was determined in our analysis as the optimal concentration of TbGSK-3s for the kinase assays (see Data analysis B). Fraction C contains 20 ng/μl of TbGSK-3s (see Data analysis B).Determination of the ATP concentrationPerform the kinase assay with the TbGSK-3s isolated fraction C.Follow Steps C2-C4.Prepare master mix solution (containing a final concentration of 1x kinase assay solution, 40 ng of TbGSK-3s isolated fraction C, 10 μΜ GSK-3 peptide substrate) as described below (final volume 40 μl per sample):4 μl x [number of samples] of 10x kinase assay solution2 μl x [number of samples] of TbGSK-3s isolated fraction C1.2 μl x [number of samples] of 333 μΜ GSK-3 peptide substrate23.8 μl x [number of samples] of ddH2OFollow Steps C6-C7.Add 10 μl of ATP in different concentrations of (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 7.5, 10 and 50 μΜ).Note: Different concentrations of ATP can be used if needed, depending on the parameters of the experiment. However, for concentrations of ATP up to 10 μΜ, you can use the Kinase-Glo® Assay (Promega), for 0-100 µM of ATP, you can use the Kinase-Glo® Plus Assay (Promega) and for 0-500 µM, you can use the Kinase-Glo® Max Assay (Promega). Follow Steps C9-C15.Plot the diagram of the rate of reaction DY/DX versus the ATP concentration and determine the Vmax and Km of ATP (see Data analysis C).",
    "Notes:DY = [(RLU x 106 upon 30 min of reaction) – (RLU x 106 upon 0 min of reaction)] DX = time of reaction = 30 min Vmax is the maximum rate of reaction and represents the rate of reaction when the enzyme is saturated with substrate. The value of the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) is numerically equal to the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of Vmax.Km of ATP was determined equal to 6.3 μΜ using 40 ng of TbGSK-3s fraction C (see Data analysis C).A standard ATP concentration, identical in all kinase assays performed with TbGSK-3s, was used and it was equal to the Km for the ATP (6.3 μΜ). Determination of the GSK-3 peptide substrate concentrationPerform the kinase assay with the TbGSK-3s isolated fraction C.Follow Steps C2-C4.Prepare master mix solution (containing a final concentration of 1x kinase assay solution, 40 ng of TbGSK-3s isolated fraction C, 10 μΜ ATP) as described below (final volume 40 μl per sample):4 μl x [number of samples] of 10x kinase assay 2 μl x [number of samples] of TbGSK-3s isolated fraction C1.2 μl x [number of samples] of 400 μΜ ATP23.8 μl x [number of samples] of ddH2OFollow Steps C6-C7.Add 10 μl of GSK-3 substrate in different concentrations of (0, 1, 2, 5, 10 and 50 μΜ).Note: Different concentrations of substrate can be used if needed, depending on the parameters of the experiment. Follow Steps C9-C15.Plot the diagram of the rate of reaction DY/DX versus the GSK-3 concentration and determine the Vmax and Km of GSK-3 substrate (see Data analysis C).Notes:Km of GSK-3 substrate was determined equal to 5.8 μΜ using 40 ng of TbGSK-3s (Fraction C) (see Data analysis C).",
    "A standard GSK-3 substrate concentration, identical in all kinase assays performed with TbGSK-3s, was used and it was equal to the Km for the GSK-3 substrate (5.8 μΜ).Identification of TbGSK-3s inhibitorsPerform the kinase assay with the TbGSK-3s isolated fraction C.Follow Steps C2-C4.Prepare master mix solution (containing a final concentration of 1x kinase assay solution, 40 ng of TbGSK-3s isolated fraction C) as described below (final volume 40 μl per sample):4 μl x [number of samples] of 10x kinase assay solution 2 μl x [number of samples] of TbGSK-3s isolated fraction C22.7 μl x [number of samples] of ddH2OFollow Steps C6-C7.Add 10 μl of inhibitor in different concentrations (0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.33, 1 and 3.33 μΜ).Note: Different concentrations of inhibitors can be used if needed, depending on the parameters of the experiment. Add 5.8 μΜ GSK-3 peptide substrate in each sample (0.7 μl of 333 μΜ GSK-3 peptide substrate).Add 6.3 μΜ ATP in each sample (0.6 μl of 400 μΜ ATP).Follow Steps C9-C15.Plot the diagram of the % inhibition of TbGSK-3s activity versus the inhibitor’s concentration and determine the IC50 of the inhibitor (see Data analysis D).Note: The sample with no inhibitor serves as a positive control. Moreover, use a sample that contains no ATP as a negative control (4 μl kinase assay solution 10x, 2 μl TbGSK-3s isolated fraction C containing 40 ng of kinase, 0.7 μl GSK-3 peptide substrate 333 μΜ in order to obtain 5.8 μΜ final concentration, and 33.3 μl ddH2O)."
