This includes the processing of the tumor tissue after reception from the hospital, organoid culture and biobanking. The processes described below must be performed under Biosafety level 2 (BSL2) and sterile conditions.\nNote: Prior to tissue manipulation, pre-warm organoid medium to 37°C in the water bath. Prepare sterile BSC II with required material and transfer agar flasks to BSC II prior tumor tissue collection.\nTumor tissue processing\nTiming: 1 h\nThe resected viable tumor tissue (from male and female) remaining after neuropathology sample is collected is placed in 10 mL ice-cold DMEM in the operating theater and stored at 4°C in the hospital until collection. Short time between surgery and collection is advised (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). We regularly collect the tumor tissue within 30 min after end of the surgery.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/657-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Derivation of organoids from tumor tissue\n(A) Tumor tissue processing: (1) Tumor reception in DMEM, (2) Tissue transfer to a glass petri dish before cutting, (3–4) Mechanical mincing with scalpels, (5–6) Transfer of tissue fragments to culture flasks coated with agar.\n(B) Examples of good quality organoids derived from brain tumor tissue.\n(C) Examples of fused organoids after prolonged culture.\n(D) Brain tumor tissue fragments that did not form organoids.\nTransfer tumor tissue to a glass petri dish under BSC II sterile conditions. Remove excess medium.",
    "Note: We find most comfortable to cut tissue in glass petri dishes of 100 mm in diameter with 2 mm high glass borders. Cutting in plastic petri dishes leads to production of small plastic pieces floating in the culture. If 5-Aminolevulinic Acid (5-ALA) is used during surgery, we recommend working in the dark to limit a potential fluorescence-associated toxicity.\nAdd 0.5 - 1 mL of fresh organoid medium to ensure sufficient moisture of the tissue during processing.\nIf desired cut small tissue fragments and snap freeze for downstream molecular analysis.\nMince tumor tissue for approximately 10 - 20 min at 20°C–22°C with sterile scalpels until obtaining small tumor fragments invisible by eye (approximately 0.5 mm × 0.5 mm). Add more medium if needed. See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] for problems during mincing.\nNote: Visible bone fragments, fixed tissue or blood clots should be removed prior mincing. Certain tumor types can be difficult to cut and longer time may be required for larger samples.\nTransfer tissue fragments into a 50 mL falcon tube. Rinse the petri dish with organoid medium to collect all fragments.\nAllow tissue fragments to sediment at 20°C–22°C for approximately 5 min at the bottom of the falcon tube. Do not centrifuge!\nAspirate the medium and resuspend tissue fragments in fresh organoid medium. Transfer cultures to agar flasks. Volume needs to be adjusted to reach high culture density. On average 1–2 T75 flasks are sufficient (15–20 mL per flask). More than one flask may be needed for larger tumors. For smaller tumor tissue use one T25 flask (4–5 mL per flask).\nIncubate the culture flasks in a standard cell culture incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2 and 21% O2. Keep the vent/close cap open or replace with a filter cap.",
    "Discard remaining material according to internal rules for the BSL2 waste.\nAfter 1 - 2 days, verify cultures under the microscope for contamination and tissue fragments size. If tissue fragments appear too large see troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nA high amount of blood in the tissue may also cause a change in pH. Proceed with medium change after 1 day in culture if pH change is observed. We do not recommend performing red blood cell lysis as we have noticed that glioma cells are particularly sensitive to the classical erythrocyte lysis buffers based on ammonium chloride.\nOrganoid culture\nTiming: 7–14 days\nOrganoid cultures should be monitored on a regular basis. Change medium after 5 - 7 days of culture. If cultures appear too dense (e.g., change in pH indicated by yellow Phenol red) or high number of debris is observed proceed with medium change earlier.\nGently collect the tissue fragments and organoids in a 50 mL falcon tube.\nSediment organoids for approximately 5 min. Do not centrifuge.\nAspirate medium and resuspend organoids in an appropriate volume of pre-warmed organoid medium. Transfer cultures to fresh agar flasks. Culture for 10–14 days before freezing.\nNote: If well-structured organoids are already formed after one week of culture (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B), freeze cultures following protocol described below. If organoids start to fuse, proceed with freezing (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). Fused organoids can be re-minced with scalpels prior cryopreservation.\nCritical: Quality and quantity of organoids rely on size and quality of tumor tissue obtained. This step allows preselecting tissue with high tumor content, organoid derivation is limited from necrotic areas and normal brain with low tumor content. See troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] for organoid cultures with high amount of debris.\nOrganoid biobanking\nTiming: 1 h",
    "Organoids should be used directly for implantation or frozen after maximum 10 - 14 days in culture. Organoids will start to fuse after prolonged culture.\nFreezing protocol\nGently collect the organoids in a 50 mL falcon tube. In case of cultures containing high amount of debris and dead tissue pieces (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D), collect good quality organoids under a binocular microscope. If possible, place the binocular under the BSCII and collect manually the healthy organoids.\nSediment organoids at the bottom of the falcon tube for approximately 5 min. Do not centrifuge.\nAspirate medium and resuspend organoids in an appropriate volume of ice-cold freezing medium.\nTransfer 1 mL of organoids into cryogenic vials. Aim to freeze 35–40 organoids per 1 mL freezing medium in one cryogenic vial.\nPlace cryogenic vials in a Mr. Frosty freezing container (or equivalent) and transfer to −80°C for 12 - 24 h.\nAfter 12–24 h, transfer cryogenic vials to a liquid nitrogen tank for long-term storage.\nNote: The organoids derived from patient material correspond to the generation 0 (G0). Organoids obtained at later stages upon serial transplantation of PDOXs must be denoted with appropriate generation number (generation of organoids = generation of PDOX they were derived from).\nDefrosting protocol\nTo defrost organoids for implantation or functional assays, thaw cryogenic vials with organoids rapidly at 37°C.\nGently transfer the defrosted solution with organoids to 15 mL tube. Add slowly drops of pre-warmed organoid medium up to 3 mL (1 mL per minute).\nShake gently up and down and incubate 5 min.\nAdd organoid medium up to 10 mL.\nSediment organoids for approximately 5 min, aspirate the medium containing DMSO.",
    "Resuspend organoids in fresh organoid medium, transfer to agar flask and culture at 37°C in the incubator for 24 h to 72 h before surgery/experiment. For IDH mutated models showing compromised survival of organoids during cryopreservation see Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: Organoid culture can be obtained from brain tumors of different types and grades, including gliomas, meningiomas and brain metastases. We have successfully obtained high quality organoids from 79% of GBMs and 68% of grade II-III gliomas. The growth of organoids depends on patient tumor and is generally limited after 7 days in culture. Viable organoids with a diameter between 400 μm and 1000 μm are selected for intracerebral implantation in mice. Our cultures can be adapted to the serum-free media supplemented with the growth factors (Christensen et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). However, we have not compared systematically organoids cultured in the two different media and we have not used organoids cultured in serum-free conditions for the implantation. For more discussion on organoid media composition see (Klein et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nEstablishment of patient-derived orthotopic xenografts (PDOXs)\nTiming: up to 16 months\nThis part describes implantation of tumor organoids and mouse monitoring during development of PDOX models.\nCerebral implantation of organoids\nTiming: 3 h\nIntracortical implantation of organoids in immunodeficient mice is performed to induce tumor growth in vivo and to establish PDOX models. Animals must be housed in individually ventilated cages in a Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) facility, under controlled environment (temperature 22 ± 2°C, humidity between 45% and 65% and 12 h light / 12 h dark cycle) with free access to autoclaved and acidified water and irradiated food ad libitum.\nPreparation of glioma organoids for implantation\nCollect viable organoids of 400 - 1000 μm under binocular microscope or equivalent.\nCritical: This step requires gentle handling to avoid mechanical breaking of organoids.",
    "Gently transfer selected organoids to a 50 mL falcon tube using 2 mL to 10 mL pipette.\nSediment organoids at the bottom of the falcon tube for approximately 5 min.\nAspirate the medium and wash organoids in 10 mL of DMEM w/o supplements. Repeat 2 times.\nResuspend organoids in 15 mL of DMEM and incubate on ice until surgery.\nOptional: Cryopreserved organoids can be used for implantation. Defrost organoids as described above and culture in organoid medium for 24 - 72 h before surgery.\nIntracortical implantation\nNote: We routinely use NSG mice (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ, males and females, between 8 and 16 weeks) for PDOXs development due to their strong immunodeficiency and long survival. In initial experiments, we used NOD SCID mice (NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/NCrCrl, male and female) or eGFP+ NOD SCID (Niclou et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). However, the NOD SCID strain have high incidence of thymic lymphoma, which limits mice survival and experimental time frame. Nude mice can also be used for implantation of organoids obtained from well-established PDOX models for large-scale experiments. In general, we do not observe tumor growth differences between these strains.\nInject buprenorphine subcutaneously (volume of injection 10 mL/kg, dose 0.1 mg/kg) to NSG mice to ensure analgesia for 4 - 6 h time period.\nPre-warm the recovery chamber and the cover to 37°C.\nPrepare the sterile field with all surgical instruments and reagents needed (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/657-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Fill the Hamilton syringe with organoids. Transfer organoids to the petri dish and manually aspirate 6 organoids in maximum volume of 2 μl. For problems during aspiration procedure, see Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nFix the syringe in the syringe holder of the stereotactic frame.\nPerform a short incision (~ 0.7 cm) and open the skin in order to expose the bregma, the sagittal and coronal sutures (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nKeep the needle at an angle of 90° to the skull and place it directly on the bregma to set the 0 position for the X and Y axis on the frame’s ruler (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nPlace the needle on the surface of the brain to set the 0 position for Z axis.\nUsing the stereotaxic ruler, move the needle to the X (2 mm right) and Y (1 mm front) coordinates to locate the drill site (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D). See Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] for possible injection to the lateral ventricle.\nDrill a small hole of 0.7 mm diameter.\nUsing the micro-scalpel, remove the remaining piece of bone and perform cross incision of the dura mater.\nPlace the needle on the surface of the brain to set the 0 position for Z axis on the frame’s ruler and slowly lower the needle 0.5 mm deeper than the Z depth (2 mm).\nWait for 2 min, slightly retract (0.5 mm) the needle and inject slowly the organoids (1 min for 1 μl) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nKeep the needle in place for 2 min and slowly withdraw the needle.\nWash the skull with 0.9% NaCl, verify if all organoids were implanted. For incomplete injection of organoids see Troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]. Close the hole with the bone wax (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F) and close the skin with separated knots (Ethilon 3-0) (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G and 2H).",
    "Place animal in a recovery chamber until it recovers from anesthesia.\nCarefully monitor the scar for at least 5 - 7 days until loss of knots.\nAnimal supervision and verification of tumor growth in vivo\nTiming: up to 16 months\nDevelopment of glioma tumors in immunodeficient mice is expected to take between several weeks to several months after implantation. The growth depends on the neuropathological features of tumors (proliferation index, level of angiogenesis and invasion) (Bougnaud et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Golebiewska et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). Animals are supervised daily for common behavioral patterns and specific symptoms indicating tumor growth. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is applied to detect and quantify tumor growth.\nMRI\nTiming: 15–30 min\nAnesthetize the mouse with 2.5% isoflurane / oxygen mix in the induction chamber.\nTransfer the mouse to a pre-warmed Minerve bed adapted for mouse head imaging. The bed allows for constant body temperature at 37°C, and breath monitoring using a motion sensor pillow placed under the abdomen. Anesthesia is maintained through a nose mask with 2.5% isoflurane / oxygen mix.\nPlace the Minerve bed in the mouse head coil and insert the imaging cell (half pipe that contains the animal bed and the coil) in the magnet tunnel so that the head of the animal reaches the isocenter of the magnet.\nCheck the breathing rate before the start of the acquisition (PC-SAM software). Breathing rate must be between 50 and 100 per min. The anesthesia mix is adjusted during the scan session to maintain breathing in this range.\nAcquire a multislices brain scout (Preclinical software MR solutions). This short scan allows verifying that the head of the animal is correctly positioned in the isocenter using 3 different plans (sagittal, coronal and transverse) and serves to correctly position slices packages for the next imaging protocols.",
    "Note: Multi-slices brain scout (Gradient echo - GRE) is defined by an echo time (TE)/repetition time (TR) = 8/190 ms, 30 × 30 mm field of view, 9 slices, 1 mm slice thickness, and 256 × 192 matrix (spatial resolution = 0.1171 × 0.1563 mm), number of averages = 1, receiver bandwidth (BW) = 40 kHz, duration: 36 seconds.\nCritical: The parameters of the sequences described in this section are adapted for the 3T MRI system with a 3T horizontal bore 3017 magnet from MR Solutions, equipped with head and body quadrature coils for mouse and rats imaging. Parameters need to be adapted to the magnet with a different field strength.\nPerform tuning and matching of the coil and magnetic field shimming to ensure high quality of the scans.\nSelect the Axial Fast Spin Echo T2-weighted MRI sequence (FSE T2w Scan).\nProperly position the slices packages of the scan. Anatomical landmarks can be used to reproducibly position slices and facilitate comparisons in time series. The top of the frame should be aligned with the top of the brain in the coronal plan. The frame is then rotated in the Axial plane to correct for animal head side tilting by aligning symmetrical landmarks visible in the scout images parallel to the slices. In the sagittal plane, the left side of the frame must be aligned with the olfactory bulb and the cerebellum. The first 3 slices are placed to cover the olfactory bulbs.\nStart the acquisition of the FSE T2w scan.",
    "Note: Axial FSE-T2w scan is defined by echo time (TE)/repetition time (TR) = 68/3000 ms, 25 × 25 mm field of view, 15 Slices, 1 mm slice thickness, and 256 × 248 matrix (spatial resolution = 0.0977 × 0.1008 mm), echo train length = 8, number of averages = 4, receiver bandwidth (BW) = 20 kHz, duration: 6 min 12 seconds.\nIf Tumor contrast enhancement is desired, T1w scan with contrast is applied. Copy the slice position of the pervious FSE T2w scan, select the Axial Fast Spin Echo T1-weighted MRI sequence (FSE T1w scan) and paste the slices position.\nStart the acquisition.\nAfter the first acquisition, take out the imaging cell from the MRI. Avoid displacing the bed or the coil to keep the animal in the exactly the same position.\nInject subcutaneously 100 μl of Dotarem (Gadoterate 0.5 mmol/mL), put back the imaging cell in the machine and wait for 5 min.\nStart the acquisition of the FSE T1w scan.\nNote: Axial FSE-T1w scan is defined by echo time (TE)/repetition time (TR) = 17/1400 ms, 25 × 25mm field of view, 15 Slices, 1 mm slice thickness, and 256 × 256 matrix (spatial resolution = 100 × 100 μm), echo train length = 4, number of averages = 4, receiver bandwidth (BW) = 20 kHz, duration: 5 min 42 seconds.\nRemove the imaging cell from the machine after the acquisition, then remove the mouse from the bed, place directly in the cage and supervise until awoken.\nNote: Frequency of the MRI scans should be adapted according to the PDOX model. MRI can be performed once a week for PDOX with fast tumor growth. For PDOXs with slow tumor growth MRI once every 2 months is sufficient. For new PDOX models, MRI scan is advised upon first neurological symptoms.",
    "Critical: Highly invasive tumors are not detectable by MRI, close and strict supervision of each mouse is mandatory to recognize first neurological symptoms and avoid pain.\nTumor quantification based on MRI images (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/657-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. MRI Imaging of GBM tumor in PDOX brain\nMRI slices of mouse head from the anterior part to the posterior part. Tumor visible as brighter area is delineated on each slice (red line). The area of each slice (mm2) is summed to obtain the tumor volume in mm3.\nOpen MRI-obtained DICOM files in the ImageJ software.\nAdjust the brightness of the images.\nDelineate the tumor to define the area of the tumor on each slice.\nTumor volume in mm3 is defined by the sum of the tumor area on each slice (slice thickness is 1 mm).\nNote: Similarly to patient tumors, the invasive part of PDOX tumors is undetectable by MRI, thus immunohistochemistry is essential to confirm the size and the histopathological phenotype of the tumor. See (Bougnaud et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) for detailed analysis of histopathological phenotypes.\nMouse supervision and PDOX tumor tissue processing\nVerify the mouse every day and fill in the score sheet. The score sheet (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) should contain observation regarding common behavior of each mouse and specific symptoms linked to brain tumor. Scoring criteria:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_657_4.csv\n0 = No symptoms , normal behavior, no body weight loss ; 1 (starting) = Starting symptoms and body weight loss ≤5% ; 2 (established) = Established symptoms, abnormal behavior and body weight loss between 5 and 15% ; 3 (strong)= Strong symptoms , body weight loss ≥15% and tumor size (if quantifiable ≥100% mm3). Perform euthanasia if: 3 criteria = 2 or 1 criteria = 3\nScore 0 = no symptoms, normal behavior",
    "Score 1 = mild symptoms, start & body weight loss ≤ 5%,\nScore 2 = established symptoms & body weight loss >5% and <15%,\nScore 3 = severe symptoms, body weight ≥ 15% and tumor size bigger than 100 mm3.\nThe mouse is euthanized when three symptoms reach a score of 2 or one symptom reaches a score of 3.\nEuthanize the mouse by cervical dislocation.\nGently extract the brain.\nFresh mouse brain can be used to obtain organoids with the same protocol as described for patient tumor tissue. Remove the midbrain. Mechanically mince brain hemispheres with scalpels.\nNote: If desired, two hemispheres can be processed separately to measure efficiency of organoid derivation from the tumor core (right hemisphere) and invasive zone (left hemisphere). For well-established PDOX models with known histopathological phenotype, select only part of the hemisphere(s) where tumor cells are expected.\nGenerated PDOX-derived organoids (G1) can be implanted directly for derivation of Generation 2 PDOXs or cryopreserved using the protocols described above.\nNote: Serial transplantation involves subsequent intracranial implantations and derivation of organoids from PDOXs. We consider generation 3 (G3) PDOXs as stable models, which can be used for preclinical application. We have observed that genetically heterogeneous tumors may undergo clonal selection in the first two passages in vivo (Stieber et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). Although PDOXs at generation 1 can directly be used for experiments (see e.g., (Golebiewska et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8])), this compromises significantly the number of organoids available for further implantation and maintenance of the PDOX models long term.",
    "Critical: 6 mice are commonly used per implantation series. This allows for detailed characterization of the PDOX model and biobanking of sufficient organoids for further use. Use of several mice per implantation series increases the success rate of the first generation, particularly in case of slowly growing tumors, as mice can be lost due to independent health problem and/or aging. In certain PDOX models, delay in tumor growth was observed if organoids were cultured for more than 15 days or due to sensitivity upon freezing-thawing process. Histological verification of tumor features is advised at each PDOX generation.\nPDOX tissue processing and derivation of standardized organoids for ex vivo functional assays and drug testing\nTiming: 3–5 h\nMechanical dissociation of PDOX tumor tissue and subsequent organoid culture limits the usage of the PDOX models for functional assays and preclinical drug testing requiring single cells and/or standardized organoids. In this part, we describe a protocol allowing for dissociation of brain tissue into single cells followed by purification of human tumor cells and xenograft-based murine cells constituting tumor microenvironment (TME) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). Isolated cells can be applied for varying functional assays and reconstitution of standardized organoids.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/657-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Magnetic sorting allows for efficient removal of myelin (recognized as FSClow/SSChigh events), but not small cell debris (FSSlowSSClow).",
    "(C) Flow cytometry-based analysis of single cell suspension prior and after depletion of mouse TME cells. Analysis was performed on PDOX P8 implanted in eGFP+ NOD/SCID mice (Golebiewska et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). Tumor cells are recognized as EGFR+GFP- (black events). Mouse TME cells are EGFR-GFP+ (green events). Erythrocytes appear as EGFR-GFP- (red events). Human cell fraction contains mouse erythrocytes. Mouse cell fraction is significantly contaminated by the tumor cells, due to non-specific capture at LS columns. Percentages of single viable cells are displayed for each fraction.\nEnzymatic dissociation of PDOX-derived tumor tissue\nTiming: 1 h\nTo dissociate glioma PDOX-derived tumors, enzymatic digestion based on papain and DNAse I is recommended. Here we describe the protocol based on the Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi), however, other equivalent protocols are also available.\nPreheat a water bath to 37°C.\nPrepare enzyme mix 1 (EM1) by adding components specified in the Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit product leaflet and pre-warm to 37oC to ensure optimal enzymatic activity.\nRemove olfactory bulbs (myelin-rich) and midbrain. Collect part of the brain hemisphere(s) containing tumor cells.\nMoist tissue with ice-cold HBSS w/o Ca2+/Mg2+.\nCut tumor tissue with scalpels for several min and transfer tissue fragments into a 50 mL falcon tube, wash by adding ice-cold HBSS up to 20 mL.\nCentrifuge at 300 g for 3 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend tissue pellet in EM1 and incubate for 15 min at 37°C in water bath, mix tube gently every 5 min.\nPrepare enzyme mix 2 (EM2) by adding components specified in the product leaflet, add EM2 to the tissue.\nDissociate tissue mechanically using a glass pipette with cotton plug. Pipet up and down 10 times, avoid air bubbles.\nIncubate for 10 min at 37°C. Mix tube gently every 5 min during the incubation period.",
    "Repeat mechanical dissociation with a glass pipette.\nOptional: If tissue fragments are still visible, incubate another 10 min at 37°C.\nAdd 10 mL HBSS to the dissociated tissue and filter cells through a 50 μm sterile filter. Collect single cell suspension into a 15 mL falcon tube.\nCentrifuge single cell suspension at 300 g for 3 min at 4°C.\nNote: Single cells can be incubated on ice for a short period before next steps.\nCritical: For experiments requiring subsequent cell culture perform tissue dissociation under sterile conditions. For experiments requiring molecular analysis of isolated cells, except for tissue dissociation at 37°C, perform remaining steps at 4°C.\nOptional: Myelin removal\nTiming: 1 h\nAmount of myelin depends on the tissue collected and histopathological features of each PDOX model. E.g., dissociation of angiogenic tumors leads to low amount of myelin fibers, invasive tumors may still show relatively high amount of myelin fibers after tissue dissociation. Removal of myelin prior to depletion of mouse cells is only needed if the experiment requires isolation of mouse TME cells. Myelin can be removed with magnetic sorting using MACS® Myelin Removal Beads II.\nResuspend tissue pellet in 1800 μl ice-cold MACS buffer per PDOX tumor. Add 200 μl of Myelin Removal Beads II.\nNote: Indicated volumes are sufficient for up to 500 mg tissue.\nMix gently, do not vortex. Incubate for 15 min in the refrigerator (4°C, do not incubate on ice).\nWash cells by adding 13 mL ice-cold MACS buffer and centrifuge at 300 g for 10 min. Aspirate supernatant completely.\nAdd 3 mL of MACS buffer per 200 μl of Myelin Removal Beads II.",
    "Use 3 LS columns per PDOX tumor. Place 50 μm sterile filter on top of each column (if not filtered before). Place LS columns in the magnetic field of a suitable MACS® magnetic cell separator.\nPrepare LS columns by rinsing with 3 × 1 mL ice-cold MACS buffer per column. Collect buffer in 15 mL falcon tubes. . Discard tubes and collected buffer.\nPlace new 15 mL collection flacon tubes under the columns on ice.\nTransfer 1 mL of single cell suspension through each filter and LS column. Collect flow-through fraction containing single cells.\nWash columns with 3 × 1 mL of ice-cold MACS buffer, collect to the same falcon tubes.\nPool collected cells from 3 falcon tubes. Adjust volume to 20 mL with ice-cold MACS buffer. Count the cells.\nNote: Myelin fibers will be retained in the LS columns. The flow-through fraction should contain pure single cell suspension. Small debris will still be visible (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nPurification of human tumor cells\nTiming: 1 h\nHuman tumor cells can be purified by depleting mouse cells constituting TME with magnetic sorting using Miltenyi’s Mouse Cell Depletion kit.\nContinue with single cell suspension obtained directly after tissue dissociation (collection of tumor cells only) or after myelin removal (for experiments requiring collection of mouse cells).\nDetermine total cell number or tumor cell number with a hemocytometer. Centrifuge at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate buffer and resuspend cell pellet: 80 μl ice-cold MACS buffer per 2 × 10⁶ tumor cells or 10⁷ total cells including red blood cells.\nNote: Visual discrimination between human tumor and mouse TME cells during counting is not always possible. Tumor cells often present similar size as certain mouse cells within TME.",
    "Add 20 μl cell depletion cocktail per cell suspension in 80 μl ice-cold MACS buffer. Incubate for 15 min at 4°C in the fridge (do not incubate on ice).\nNote: Cell number obtained from one mouse brain vary across PDOX models. 3 - 5 × 10⁶ tumor cells per brain can be expected from small or highly invasive tumors, whereas larger and highly proliferative tumors contain > 30 × 10⁶ tumor cells. Volume of the cell depletion cocktail and the number of LS columns needs to be adjusted accordingly.\nUse one LS column per cell suspension in 80 μl ice-cold MACS buffer. If filtering was not performed before, place a 50 μm filter on top of each column. Place LS columns in the magnetic field of a suitable MACS® magnetic cell separator.\nPrepare LS column(s) by rinsing with 3 × 1 mL MACS buffer per column. Collect buffer in 15 mL falcon tubes. Place new 15 mL collection flacon tubes under the columns on ice.\nAdjust volume to 500 μl using ice-cold MACS buffer for up to 2 × 10⁶ tumor cells or up to 10⁷ total cells. Apply cell suspension to the LS column(s). Collect flow through fraction containing human tumor cells.\nWash LS column(s) with 5 × 1 mL of ice-cold MACS buffer and collect flow through fraction. This fraction represents human tumor cells.\nIf desired, collect mouse cells from the LS columns by washing the column with 3 mL ice-cold MACS buffer. Remove the column from the magnetic cell separator and push buffer with the plunger.",
    "Note: Purification is not 100% efficient. Human fraction is contaminated with mouse erythrocytes, which lost mouse-specific membrane epitopes during tissue dissociation. Mouse cell fraction still contains human cells captured physically in the column (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). If higher purification is required for functional assays, replace magnetic sorting with fluorescent-activated cell sorting (Bougnaud et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Golebiewska et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nCritical: If the mouse is sacrificed too early due to other health problems, the number of tumor cells obtained from the brain of not fully developed PDOX can be limited.\nIf applicable, pool human tumor and mouse cell fractions from separate LS columns, respectively. Count cells with hemocytometer.\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 300 g for 3 min at 4°C. Resuspend cell pellet in the buffer or medium adequate for the downstream application.\nSingle tumor and mouse cells can also be cryopreserved. Follow the protocol described for organoids.\nCritical: To ensure specific antibody binding, this procedure should be performed at 4°C. It is key to apply ice-cold MACS buffer to LS columns and collect cells on ice.\nFormation of standardized organoids\nTiming: 2 days\nStandardized tumor organoids can be reformed from isolated single tumor cells. This allows also for co-cultures of tumor cells with subpopulations of TME cells in a standardized ratio (Bougnaud et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nTo reform standardized organoids use either freshly isolated or cryopreserved single tumor cells from above described workflow.\nAfter defrosting, incubate tumor cells in 50 mL falcon tube in organoid medium for 20–30 min. Count cells to determine number of viable cells.\nNote: Single tumor cells show variable viability after cryopreservation depending on the PDOX model. Dead cell staining should be used for cell counting (e.g., Trypan Blue). Adapted freezing media may be need to increase viability of single cells after cryopreservation.",
    "Seed 1000 cells per well in 25 μl organoid medium in a 384-well u-shaped, low adherence plate. If using 96-well plates, adapt volume to 50 μl.\nNote: Cell number can be adapted to the experimental needs. 1000 cells will allow for creation of small organoids of size between 100 - 300 μl (depending on the size of the tumor cells), applicable for preclinical drug testing protocols. Larger organoids, of size equivalent to organoids obtained by mechanical dissociation, can be grown from 10 - 50 ∗ 104 cells.\nFill unused wells with 90 μl HBSS (or equivalent) according to the plate layout.\nCritical: Avoid seeding of cells in outer wells and edge well regions due to potential edge effect phenomenon on organoids during longer experimental protocols.\nCentrifuge 384-well plates to pellet cells softly at maximum 300 g for 3–5 min at 4°C. If cells do not assemble at the bottom of the plate, repeat centrifugation.\nPlace plates on a 3D shaker in a standard incubator and shake at high speed (approximately 30 – 40 rpm) for 48 h to allow for organoid formation.\nProceed to the experimental protocol. Add 25 μl of organoid medium containing desired compound(s) to reach total volume of 50 μl."
