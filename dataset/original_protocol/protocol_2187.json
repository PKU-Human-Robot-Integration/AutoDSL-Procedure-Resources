    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCalculation of shear stress\nCalculation of shear stress is described for the μ-channel VI 0.4 system. Formula for μ-channel VI 0.4 (differs for other channel types, see application note at Ibidi https://ibidi.com/img/cms/support/AN/AN11_Shear_stress.pdf[href=https://ibidi.com/img/cms/support/AN/AN11_Shear_stress.pdf]):   τ  =  η ⋅  176.1 ⋅  Φ  .\n(Φ = flow rate mL/min; τ = shear stress dyn cm-2; η = dynamical viscosity of the flow medium dyn⋅s cm-2, see also Ibidi application note).\nDynamical viscosity (η) for μ-channel VI 0.4,   η  =  0.0072  d y n · s  c  m  − 2     (for aqueous solutions).\nSolve for Φ:    τ  η∗ 176.1   =  Φ  . When 1 dyne cm-2 is to be applied to the channel set a flow rate of:     1   dyne cm  − 2     0.0072  dyn ·  s cm  − 2   ∗  176.1   = ∼ 0.8   ml min  − 1    .\nYou can now set a flow rate of 0.8 mL on the pump to achieve 1 dyne cm-2 of shear stress in the μ-channels. Physiological shear stress in venous cells ranges between 0.5 to 5 dyne cm-2 or more (Malek et al., 1999[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). We use 0.7 dyne cm-2 for CTL and other leukocytes as well.\nNote: The flow rate setting on the pump depends on the diameter of the used syringe. Ensure to set the correct diameter for syringe-based pump systems to apply the correct flow rate.\nPreparation of the flow system\nTiming: 1 h before start of the experiment",
    "The inflamed monolayer containing μ-channels are connected to the pump system and are flown with HEPES buffer for equilibration. Setting up the flow system is very straightforward, yet there are some points to note, especially the connection of the flow tubing to the channel inlets. Avoid inclusion of air bubbles at the inlet connected to the liquid container (opposite to the pump) as they will flow through the channel causing damage to the monolayer near instantaneously. This can be achieved by filling inlets to be connected until a meniscus forms at the top (1–2 mm high, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). The flow system (filled with HEPES+ buffer) Luer connector can be filled up with buffer while holding it upside down to remove excess air. This greatly decreases occasions of air inclusion.\nPlace the μ-channel containing inflamed endothelial monolayers (check for consistent monolayer under cell culture microscope) to a microscope with phase contrast imaging and fix to a sample holder.\nEnsure the slide is fixed and remove the lid, cover all but the channel to be used with the lid by shifting it to the side (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: Avoids evaporation of medium from and contamination of the unused channels while imaging another.\nConnect the flow tubing (pump to channel and liquid container (HEPES+) to channel slide, includes clamps (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, ∗) to block liquid flow when disconnecting tubes for attachment to channel inlets) via a small piece of tubing (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, #).\nUnlock the clamps and connect the pump to one side (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, #) and the liquid container to the other (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, Methods videos S6[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc6] and S7[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc7]).",
    "Flush the tubing (stored in 70% ethanol) with 50 mL water followed by 50 mL PBS and 50 mL HEPES+ (A high flow rate of 10 mL min-1 can be used as no cells are present) (Methods video S8[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc8]).\nClamp the tubing (Methods video S9[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc9]) on both sides and apply excess volume to the μ-channel inlet chambers of the channel to be imaged (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nRemove the connective tubing (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, green #).\nConnect the Luer connectors from the pump and container side to the channel (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nFlush excess air out of the Luer connector using a 200 μL pipette tip and placing the opening facing up before connecting.\nFlush the endothelial cells with HEPES+ buffer at ∼ 0.7 dyne cm2 for at least 10 min.\nCritical: Avoid air bubble inclusion during connection of the liquid container side Luer connector. Once connected removal of the Luer connectors will flush the channel with air bubbles and the channel cannot be recovered. Prepare excess channels in case this happens. Bubbles trapped at the pump side will flow away (unless the bubble is very large) towards the pump without passing the channel, thus can do no damage to the monolayer. For optimal flow conditions it is recommended to connect both Luer connectors without air inclusions. Fill Luer outlets with a 200 μL pipette tip and HEPES+ buffer to remove excess air before connecting. Also ensure during injection of CTL not to introduce air into the system as this can reach the monolayer and have destructive effects on the monolayer. Tap air out of the syringe carefully before injecting.\nImaging transmigration under flow\nTiming: min to 1 h",
    "In this step image series of CTL flown over the inflamed monolayer of endothelial cells are recorded microscopically. For quantitative analysis 10× or 20× objectives are optimal using phase contrast (not DIC or brightfield) as the phase contrast change of transmigrated CTL can easily be identified. For imaging in higher detail many overlapping positions in the channel need to be recorded to record enough events with the lower field of view (63× or 100× objectives). At this higher magnification we recommend using fluorescent labels for CTL and HUVEC.\nPrepare 1 mL of CTL at 1 × 106 mL-1 in RPMI or HEPES+.\nUse the microscope software position system and save several positions randomly on the channel connected to the flow system. Focus and use an auto-focus function if available.\nAvoid areas too close to the channel walls.\nTest the positions, lighting and focus settings by running the series for 2 or 3 rounds.\nInject the CTL from the syringe slowly into the injection port (located within the liquid container side tubing, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, ∗).\nCritical: Inject very slowly as fast injection will cause cells to flow back potentially into the liquid container,\nNote: Try to match the pump speed (for our pump and the used 60 mL syringes it holds (diameter 26.7 mm) a flow rate of 0.5 mL per min creates shear forces of around 1 dyne cm-2 which is close to the physiological flow rate in veins (Malek et al., 1999[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nStart a live image and follow a position near the inlet from the liquid container.\nOnce CTL begin “raining” into the live frame (top to bottom or bottom to top depending on the pump orientation) start recording (15–30 min at 5–10 s intervals). Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1], 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7], 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9], and 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11].",
    "Critical: Remaining focus is crucial for proper analysis especially at higher magnifications so ideally use an auto-focus solution. For CTL 15–25 min recording usually are enough for cells to transmigrate, this reduces the file size. Other cells like neutrophils and monocytes transmigrate even faster. We recommend 20 min as a sufficient time frame for CTL. If cell adhesion but no transmigration can be observed after 15 min, troubleshoot CTL activity and HUVEC inflammatory response.\nImage analysis and quantification of transmigration parameters\nOpen the saved image series in ImageJ. ImageJ can be freely downloaded from https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html[href=https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html] (Schindelin et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nOpen the counting tool and prepare and prepare an excel file.\nNote: CTL adapt different morphologies when adhering to inflamed HUVEC, ranging from round (non-migratory) to spreading and protruding migratory phenotypes (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nNote: Transmigrated CTL can be identified by a phase contrast change from bright to dark and consistent dark contrast when underneath the endothelium (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1797-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Flow channel setup\n(A) In (A) the complete tubing is shown as required for setting up the flow system.\n(B) Placement of the lid when using several channels for flow experiments. Black outline indicates shifted lid position. This avoids evaporation of the medium from the channels during recordings. The use of a humidifier in the microscope chamber is still recommended.\n(C) to properly attach the Luer locks from the flow tubing to the channel without trapping air bubbles in the inlets, apply medium to one inlet until a meniscus forms on both inlets (water was used for demonstrative purposes and colored blue for visibility).\n(D) Successful connected Luer connectors without air inclusion.",
    "(E–G) Coating solutions and cell suspension loading is performed by tilting the pipet tip towards the channel inlet at the bottom of the loading chamber (E). Add coating solution or cell suspension in one quick eject (F). Successful loading or seeding with homogenous distribution of the liquid and no air inclusions (G) (related to: Preparation of the flow system).\nMove the time slider to the end of the series and count the number of CTL in the image.\nThis is the number of adherent cells.\nUse the ImageJ counting tool using different groups to count adherent, transmigrated and so on.\nSave the counts in an excel file.\nFollow each cell individually CTL from adhesion through the timeline and visually identify transmigrated cells by change in phase contrast (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nMark the cells transmigration spot using the counting tool.\nThis gives the number of all transmigration events (local and distant).\nNote: Ensure cells are transmigrated and not just flattened (CTL also turn dark but turn bright again later in their path).\nNote: Follow each transmigrated CTL individually to ensure it is properly transmigrated. This (flattening with increased phase contrast) is very rare in controls but can occur for certain experimental conditions, e.g., inhibiting adhesion factors (Schoppmeyer et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3])) Example in Methods video S9[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc10] (see also Critical below).\nDetermine for each transmigrated cell how many EC:EC junctions they passed from their point of adhesion before transmigration (if they cross more than one junction, or equally pass several cell bodies, before transmigrating they are scored as distant diapedesis events).\nThis gives the number of distantly transmigrated CTL.",
    "Note: This is important as we could show that transcellular diapedesis relies on the sequential local activation of adhering CTL via the diapedesis synapse (Schoppmeyer et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) and when synapse formation is inhibited CTL begin apical migration and show more distant events which are mostly paracellular.\nLocal transmigration events:   #  o f  a l l  d i a p e d e s i s  e v e n t s  – #  o f  d i s t a n t l y  t r a n s m i g r a t e d  C T L = #  l o c a l  d i a p e d e s i s  e v e n t s  .\nFrequency of distant diapedesis events:   #  o f  d i s t a n t  d i a p e d e s i s  e v e n t s  /  #  o f  a l l  d i a p e d e s i s  e v e n t s  ∗  100  =  %  o f  d i s t a n t  d i a p e d e s i s  e v e n t s  .\nFor local transmigration events determine the route of transmigration.\nNote: Transcellular migration is preceded by a rounded phenotype and does not include apical migration of the CTL after monolayer contact (Schoppmeyer et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nNote: Paracellular events occur at EC:EC junctions and are preceded by a polarized phenotype.\nThese allow calculation of the percentage of each route of all local transmigration events.\nCount the number of adherent rounded but not transmigrated nor apically migrating CTL (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).",

    "Note: ImageJ also provides automated and manual tracking plugins. TrackMate, ManualTracking, MTrackJ are examples of plugins which are part of the ImageJ/Fiji suite, but may require separate software to analyze the generated data. Depending on the plugin these may require fluorescent or binary images for segmentation and detection. Automated tracking in phase contrast images is not viable even with proprietary software (e.g., Imaris). We recommend these for tracking experiments to analyze migratory parameters like velocity and persistence using fluorescent labels. For scoring of behavior and morphology in phase contrast images manual analysis is still superior.\nCritical: It is important to follow cells over the whole time-course especially if they change contrast (dark contrast, sign of transmigration). Although this does not occur often in control conditions certain treatments can induce the following behavior (see Methods video S10[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc10] as example). In those cases, adhering CTL flatten and adapt a darker contrast but usually spread over a larger area than after actual transmigration. You can identify these flattened but not actually transmigrated cells by: 1. carefully observing the contrast as flat untransmigrated CTL show inhomogeneous contrast while transmigrated CTL show homogeneously dark contrast; and 2. Follow the CTL over the whole time course as when showing the described behavior CTL can change the contrast back to brighter values for a part of its migration path also changing its morphology to a migratory phenotype, even if briefly. Actually, transmigrated CTL will not resurface in this system despite its 2D limitations and tend to stay compact, without many protrusions or spreading, when underneath the endothelium!"
