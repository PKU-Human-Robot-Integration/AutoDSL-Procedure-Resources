    "Coupling of dye to aptamersDuring this step a thiol-maleimide cross-linking reaction is performed to conjugate the fluorophore to aptamers. Alternatively, aptamers with a 3’-amino group can be used for further conjugation with NHS esters (e.g., Atto647N NHS-ester). Some fluorescently labeled aptamers are also commercially available.Add 10 nmoles of the thiolated aptamer with 10 mM Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine solution (TCEP; see Recipe 1) in 100 μl of 0.1 M TEAA. Heat the tube at 70 °C for 3 min and incubate the mixture at room temperature for 1 h.Desalt this reaction by size exclusion chromatography on a Biospin 6 column according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Add to the reduced aptamer (from step A2) 4 µl of 10 µg/µl maleimide-functionalized Atto647N (previously dissolved in DMSO) and mix the contents well by pipetting or vortexing. Incubate overnight at 4 °C. Recover the fluorophore-labelled aptamer by ethanol precipitation: add 100 µl of 300 mM NaCl and 450 µl cold ethanol, mix carefully by inverting the closed sample several times and freeze the sample in dry ice for 20 min (or at -20 °C for several hours), centrifuge at 15,000 x g (rcf) at 4 °C for 30 min, discard the supernatant and wash the pellet in 50 µl of 70% ethanol. Resuspend in 50 µl 1x DPBS and desalt on a Biospin 6 column into 1x DPBS.Measure the absorbance ratio at 260 nm and 650 nm.Confirm the labeling efficiency and absence of free dye by reversed phase HLPC (e.g., on a Nucleosil 100-5 C18 4 x 250 mm column using a gradient of 0-40% acetonitrile in TEAA buffer in 30 min with a flow rate of 1 ml/min at 30 °C) or by anion exchange HPLC (e.g.",
    ", Dionex DNAPac PA200 4 x 250 mm column using a gradient of 0-75% buffer B (see Recipe 12) in buffer A (see Recipe 11) in 40 min with a flow rate of 1 ml/min at 60 °C. Store the labeled aptamer sample at -20 °C until use.Cell culture preparation prior to stainingCell lines containing the receptor of interest (and cell lines lacking it, used as negative controls) should be seeded into 12-well plates containing coated coverslips with poly-L-lysine (PLL) one day before the aptamer staining. Depending on the cell line, choose adequate cell numbers (use the hemocytometer to count the cells) to reach approximately 70-80% confluence after 12-16 h incubation. The entire procedure described below must be performed under sterile conditions under a cell culture hood.HeLa (Epha2a positive) cells are grown in plates with complete DMEM medium (see Recipe 2) and A-431 (EGFR positive) and SKBR3 (ErbB2R positive) cells are cultured in complete RPMI medium (see Recipe 3). All cell lines are maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2.To split cells, first wash cells with sterile 1x DPBS, add 2-3 ml of trypsin-EDTA to cover the surface of the plate and incubate the plate for 1-5 min at 37 °C or until cells are completely detached. Add 10 ml of complete DMEM medium or RPMI medium to inactivate trypsin. Gently pipette up and down the medium containing the inactivated trypsin to detach all cells from the plate and transfer them into a sterile 15 ml tube. Centrifuge the cells at 1,000 rpm (~250 x g) for 4 min at RT.Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 10 ml of complete DMEM medium/RPMI medium.",
    "Dilute the resuspended cells to the desired concentration in fresh complete DMEM or RPMI medium and add 1 ml to every well of the 12-well plates containing PLL treated coverslips (for PLL stock solution preparation and dilution, see Recipe 4). Incubate the plates at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until staining.Preparation of functional aptamer: folding reactionDuring this step, aptamers are exposed to a high temperature at an appropriate magnesium concentration which allows them to attain a proper folding prior to the staining procedure. For better results, the folding reaction should be freshly performed each time before staining. Before starting the folding reaction, prepare a stock solution diluting aptamers in 1x DPBS to a final concentration of 30 µM and store it protected from light at 4 °C.Prepare 10 µl of 10 µM functional aptamer by mixing 3.3 µl of fluorescently labelled aptamer (30 µM aptamer stock solution), 2 µl of 5x PBS (see Recipe 5), 2 µl of 5x MgCl2 (see Recipe 6) and 2.7 µl of ultrapure DNase- and RNase-free distilled water. Please note that this reaction should be carried out in PCR tubes that fit the thermal cycler.Heat up the aptamer solution to 75 °C for 3 min and then cool down to 20 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min using a thermal cycler.Aptamer live cells stainingAspirate the medium from the cells prepared during Procedure B, rinse briefly once with complete DMEM or RPMI depending on the cell line and incubate for 10 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2 (in the cell culture incubator) with 500 µl/well of freshly prepared blocking solution containing sheared salmon sperm DNA and dextran sulfate (see Recipe 7).In the meantime, prepare the metal plate used for staining/incubation at 37 °C.",
    "Fix with tape a piece of Parafilm® M (large enough to fit all coverslips to be stained) on the surface (see Video 1) and pre-heat the metal plate containing the Parafilm® M in the cell culture incubator. <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Aptamers live staining part I. This video shows the metal plate preparation for aptamer live staining. Please note that this video is for demonstration only and that this step should be performed inside a cell culture hood.After blocking (step D1), carefully remove the coverslips from the 12-well plate using half-curved-forceps, remove the excess blocking solution by gently tapping the edges of the coverslips with a soft paper tissue and place the coverslips upside down on 60 µl of staining solution (complete DMEM supplemented with 100 μg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA and 250 nM folded aptamer) spotted onto the Parafilm® M fixed to the metal plate (made in step D2) (see Video 2). Incubate the cells for 60 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Aptamers live staining part II. This video shows removal of coverslips containing cells from the 12-well plates using half-curved-forceps and incubation of cells (on coverslips) with staining solution. Please note that this video is for demonstration only and that this step should be performed inside the cell culture hood. To avoid contamination, gloves should be sprayed with 70% ethanol.After incubation, carefully take the coverslips off the metal plate using half-curved-forceps, remove the excess staining solution by gently tapping the edges of the coverslips with a soft paper tissue, and then submerge it several times in large volumes (e.g., 20-40 ml in a small beaker) of ice-cold 1x DPBS.",
    "Briefly remove the excess 1x DPBS from the coverslips by tapping them on a tissue paper and place each one (cell-side-up) into a well of a new 12-well plate filled with 1 ml/well ice-cold 4% PFA (see Recipe 8) for fixation (see Video 3).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 3. Aptamers live staining part III. This video shows the washing step after staining procedure. Please note that video is in open air for demonstration only and that 4% PFA should only be handled in the fume hood.Fix the cells for 20 min on ice and subsequently at room temperature for another 25 min. During fixation, keep the plate protected from light to avoid fluorophore bleaching.Aspirate the PFA solution and add 1 ml of quenching solution (see Recipe 9) to each well. Incubate for 15 min at room temperature protected from light.Wash twice for 5 min with 1x DPBS (1 ml/well) and mount the coverslips with Mowiol® (see Recipe 10; e.g., 8-9 µl for an 18 mm coverslip) on microscopy glass slides.Dry the mounted coverslips in an oven at 37 °C for 20-30 min or overnight at RT and store at 4 °C protected from light until imaging."
