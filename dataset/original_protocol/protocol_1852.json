    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAnesthesia\nTiming: 5 min\nThis step ensures deep anesthesia of the mouse, which is required for the surgical procedure.\nAnesthetize the adult mouse (2–3 months old; male or female) using an anesthetic vaporizer to administer an inhalation agent (e.g., isoflurane), preferably in a ventilated fume hood. Alternatively, use a small induction chamber/container for induction in accordance with institution guidelines, and minimize human exposure.\nConfirm surgical level of anesthesia by gently pinching the tail or paw with unserrated forceps. Do not proceed until the mouse is unresponsive to the pinch.\nUsing a cotton-tipped applicator, generously apply ophthalmic ointment onto both eyes.\nALTERNATIVE TO ISOFLURANE ANESTHESIA: Injectable regimens, e.g., 75 mg/kg ketamine plus 1 mg/kg medetomidine can also be used as outlined previously (Stoica et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]). Consult the anesthesia dosage according to veterinary guidelines for species, size and age. In comparison with the inhalation agents, the injectable regimens are associated with much longer duration of anesthesia, hence sufficient ophthalmic ointment and postoperative care are required, i.e., subcutaneous fluid administration, heating pad under the cage.\nPreparation of surgical area on upper hindlimb\nTiming: 2 min\nThis step prepares the surgical area on the upper hindlimb of the mouse for surgery. Initially, the fur is removed using either a scalpel or an electrical rodent shaver, based on the user’s preference. If using an electrical rodent shaver, the user can skip step 4 below.\nSpray the fur along both hindlimbs with 70% ethanol to control the fur.\nUsing a scalpel or an electrical rodent shaver, remove the fur on the hindlimb in an area extending from slightly below the knee up to the hip region, as illustrated in the Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1445-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "Graphical illustration of AAV delivery using direct immersion of sciatic nerve in mice (SciNDi):\n(A) Area on the hindlimb prepared for surgery. The skin incision site is marked (red dashed line with pointing arrow) and also knee area is indicated (arrow),\n(B and C) Sciatic nerve trifurcation site marked by dashed circle (arrows indicate: sciatic nerve as well as the nerve branches common peroneal nerve, tibial nerve and sural nerve in the left hindlimb, visible upon separation of skin and muscle layers, and (C) application of AAV particles on the sciatic trifurcation site (marked by dashed circle) using a 10 μL filtered pipette tip. For simplicity, the procedure is depicted only on the left hindlimb. Structures are not drawn to scale.\nDisinfect the surgical area with an iodine containing solution (e.g., betadine). Wait for 15 s so that the applied betadine is dried on the skin.\nALTERNATIVE TO BETADINE: If betadine is not accessible, 70% ethanol can alternatively be used in a similar fashion.\nExposure of the trifurcation site of sciatic nerve\nTiming: 5 min\nThis step is performed to surgically expose the sciatic nerve such that the sciatic nerve trifurcation site lies in the center of the surgical field (highlighted with the dashed circle in Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C), ensuring a consistent anatomical reference point (spot) for the application of AAV particles (Richner et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]; Bala et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Savastano et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]).\nOrient the hindlimb in a slightly elevated position and secure with surgical tape onto underlying surface for optimal nerve exposure (Richner et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]). OPTIONAL: Readers may consider the injection of a local anesthetic (e.g., lidocaine) into the biceps femoris muscle according to the dosage advised by the local veterinarian.",
    "Having located the knee joint and thigh bone (femur), make a small (approx. 3–5 mm) longitudinal incision in the dermal layer proximal to the knee joint with a scalpel.\nFurther open the skin by blunt dissection using the tip of a pair of scissors.\nNow, carefully separate the muscle layer close to femur by blunt dissection with a pair of scissors, revealing the trifurcation site of the sciatic nerve, exposing approx. 5 mm of the nerve structure above and approx. 5 mm below the trifurcation site (Richner et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]).\nSee troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3] and problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\nAAV application\nTiming: 30 s\nWith this step, AAV particles are applied directly onto the sciatic nerve trifurcation site exposed in step 10.\nBriefly vortex (approx 3–5 s) the freshly thawed aliquot of AAV particles and avoid repetitive pipetting.\nKeep the thawed AAV suspension on ice throughout the procedure.\nAspirate desired volume ((in the range of 2–10 μL; (Jan et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]; Towne et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25])) with a filtered pipette tip.\nUsing an unserrated forceps, gently open the separated muscles (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B), then drop-wise (e.g., 1 drop every 2 s) apply the AAV suspension onto the sciatic nerve trifurcation site without touching the nerve (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nA co-worker may facilitate the rapid application of AAV, i.e., by loading the pipette with AAV suspension while the surgeon performs nerve exposure (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C), and immediate muscle closure post-application, so that the risk of the exposed nerve becoming dry is minimized. In this manner, the step 14 of the procedure usually takes 5–10 s.\nAvoid repetitive touching of the nerve and do not insert any foreign material into the incision, e.g., under the nerve to restrict the diffusion of AAV solution as it may damage the delicate nerve tissue. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7].",
    "Closing of the surgical wound\nTiming: 5 min\nThis step describes closing of the surgical wound.\nGently appose the muscle layers for approximately 10 s with the tip of an unserrated forceps. This allows for smooth diffusion of AAV particles around the nerve trunk.\nClose the skin wound using a veterinarian approved tissue adhesive (alternatively sutures).\nPost-operative analgesic treatment and monitoring\nTiming: 30 s\nThis step describes post-operative care and monitoring.\nInject an analgesic solution subcutaneously (e.g., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, NSAID), and apply a local analgesic (e.g., lidocaine) according to national and institutional guidelines.\nAfter returning the mouse into its home cage, monitor for approximately 2 h for any signs of unexpected discomfort and pain (restricted mobility, shivering, and vocalizations, biting the closed wound). See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\nPause point: House the mice in your animal facility for 3–6 weeks post-procedure, and then proceed to assess the AAV delivery and transgene expression in the tissue(s) of interest (see below).\nTissue isolation for AAV delivery and gene expression analyses\nTiming: 10–20 min\nThis step describes isolation of tissues for further analyses. Duration of the isolation process varies according to the desired tissues, including sciatic nerve, DRG, lumbar spinal cord and local muscle tissue (Jan et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]; Richner et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]).\nEuthanize the mouse according to institutional guidelines.\nCreate a similar intramuscular space by blunt dissection (step 10 above) and collect the trunk of sciatic nerve (extending from its emergence at the sciatic notch to the trifurcation in the popliteal fossa behind the knee joint (Jan et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]; Bala et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Richner et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]; Savastano et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]).",
    "Dissect and collect a piece of biceps femoris muscle (50–100 mg), using a forceps and a small scissor. A small piece (50–100 mg) of liver may be dissected and collected (using a forceps and small scissor) as a control tissue for gene and/or and protein expression studies.\nIsolate DRG and spinal cord tissue as illustrated previously (see accompanied video demonstration in (Richner et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]).\nProcess the collected tissue(s) for gene and/or protein expression, microscopy and desired assays relevant to interest (Benkhelifa-Ziyyat et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Chen et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Dane et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Jan et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15])."
