    "1. Detergent and buffer preparation for FSEC\nPrepare a detergent stock solution.\n\t\nTo prepare a 20 mL stock solution, weigh 4 g of dodecyl maltoside (DDM) powder and 0.4 g of cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS) powder, and make it to 20 mL with laboratory-grade distilled H2O.\nAfter adding all the components, mix with end-over-end inversion at 4 °C until the components are completely solubilized. Overnight end-over-end mixing at 4 °C is recommended.\nAliquot and store the detergent stocks at −20 °C until use. If the stock needs to be used immediately, store the detergent stock on ice.\n\t\tNOTE: The standard detergent stock used in this work was a 20% (w/v) DDM and 2% (w/v) CHS mixture (see Table of Materials). Different detergents can be used (e.g., lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol; LMNG), or the use of detergent-free extraction with polymers such as styrene-maleic acid (SMA) can be tested. This needs to be decided when designing the experimental conditions to be tested.\nPrepare a solubilization buffer.\n\t\nPrepare a solubilization buffer by combining the correct weight or volume of the components to achieve a final concentration of 100 mM HEPES, 200 mM NaCl, 20 % (v/v) glycerol, and 1x protease inhibitor cocktail (see Table of Materials) in a beaker.\n\t\tNOTE: In the present study, the preparation of 50 mL of solubilization buffer was sufficient for processing five samples.\nAdd a 0.7 volume (e.g., 35 mL if making 50 mL of buffer) of laboratory-grade distilled H2O to the beaker.\nMix on a magnetic stirrer, and using a pH meter, adjust the buffer pH to 7.5 by the dropwise addition of concentrated NaOH.\nUsing a measuring cylinder, top up the buffer to the final required volume with laboratory-grade distilled H2O.\nPrepare the SEC running buffer.",
    "Prepare the SEC running buffer by combining the correct weight or volume of the components to achieve a final concentration of 100 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol in a beaker.\n\t\tNOTE: In the present study, preparing 600 mL of SEC buffer was sufficient for running five samples.\nAdd a 0.7 volume (e.g., 420 mL if making 600 mL of buffer) of laboratory-grade distilled H2O to the beaker.\nMix on a magnetic stirrer, and using a pH meter, adjust the buffer pH to 7.5 by the dropwise addition of concentrated NaOH.\nUsing a measuring cylinder, top up the buffer to the final required volume with laboratory-grade distilled H2O.\nFilter the SEC buffer through a bottle-top 0.45 µm pore filter under a vacuum (see Table of Materials).\nOnce the buffer has passed through the filter, degas it by leaving it under the vacuum until no more bubbles appear when shaken.\nAdd a final concentration of 0.03% (w/v) DDM and 0.003% (w/v) CHS to the SEC buffer by adding the required volume of the detergent stock prepared in step 1 (e.g., 0.9 mL if making 600 mL of SEC buffer).\nPre-chill the buffer before use.\n\t\t​NOTE: Different buffers can be used depending on the conditions tested. For example, if testing the effect of different detergents on the protein of interest, a buffer with the same detergent as the one used to solubilize the protein would ideally need to be made. If testing detergent-free conditions with SMA, detergent should be omitted from the SEC buffer completely. However, see the discussion section for more details about protocol modifications for detergent screening.\n2. Sample preparation for FSEC\nPrepare the cell pellets.",
    "NOTE: The starting point for the assay is harvesting the cell pellet from a suspension cell expression culture of the GFP-tagged (or other fluorescently labeled) protein of interest. The exact timings and conditions for harvest will depend on the protein being expressed, the cell line being used, the conditions that the cells that have been grown in, and the method by which protein expression has been induced. These details are beyond the scope of this protocol. In this study, 0.5-1 g of Sf21 cell pellet was used per condition to be tested, corresponding to 25-50 mL of culture 2-3 days after infection with approximately 4 x 106 viable cells/mL of a 1:20 dilution of P2 baculovirus. Please note that the protocol described here has been tested and found to work equally well with similar wet weights of cell pellets from other eukaryoticcell lines (e.g., HEK293E).\n\t\nWhen the cells from the suspension cultures are ready to harvest, transfer 25-50 mL culture aliquots to 50 mL conical tubes.\nCounterbalance the tubes, and use a benchtop centrifuge in a swing-out bucket (see Table of Materials) at 2,000 x g for 15 min at room temperature to pellet the cells.\nRemove and discard the culture supernatant by gently tipping it away, or use a 50 mL pipet with a pipet filler if the cell pellet is particularly loose.\nIf the cells will be used immediately for analysis, place the cell pellet on ice, and proceed directly to step 5. If the cells are to be saved for use at a later stage, freeze the cells by placing them at -80 °C.",
    "If the cell pellet has been stored at -80 °C, rapidly thaw it by incubating it at room temperature for 15 min or until the sample is no longer frozen. Move the sample immediately to ice following this step.\nResuspend and solubilize the sample.\n\t\nAdd 2 mL of the solubilization buffer (step 1.2) to the cell pellet.\nIncubate with end-over-end inversion at 4 °C for 15-30 min until homogenous.\nAdd premixed detergent stock (step 1.1) (e.g., 100 µL of 20% DDM/2% CHS stock) for a final concentration of 1% DDM/0.1% CHS.\nSolubilize for 30 min with end-over-end inversion at 4 °C.\n\t\t​NOTE: If desirable, multiple conditions can be tested in parallel. The number of parallel samples that can be processed at once will depend on the available system for running the SEC experiment. In the setup described here, it was possible to process up to five samples at a time.\nPerform a low-speed centrifugation step.\n\t\nCentrifuge the sample in a pre-chilled (4 °C) benchtop centrifuge in a swing-out bucket at 2,000 x g for 15 min.\nPerform a high-speed centrifugation step.\n\t\nCarefully transfer the supernatant from the low-speed centrifugation to ultra-centrifugation tubes (e.g., 0.5-2 mL tubes) by using a blunt-ended needle attached to a 5 mL syringe, being careful not to disturb the pellet from the low-speed spin.\nBalance pairs of tubes to within 0.05 g, and place them in a fixed-angle ultracentrifugation rotor (see Table of Materials).\nCentrifuge at 4 °C for 30 min at 250,000 x g.\n3. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC)\nPrepare the fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system, and equilibrate the column.\n\t\nPrepare the system following the manufacturer's instructions (see Table of Materials), for example, by filling the system with SEC buffer and purging the pumps of air.",
    "Connect the SEC column to the FPLC, ensuring no air enters the column. This is accomplished by applying back pressure to the SEC column with a syringe filled with water (attached to the bottom of the column) in order to perform a drop-to-drop connection with the flow path of the FPLC system.\nPre-equilibrate the SEC column by washing it first in 1.5 column volumes (36 mL for a 24 mL column) of laboratory-grade distilled and filtered H2O, followed by 1.5 column volumes of SEC buffer at the recommended flow rate and pressure for the column (see Table of Materials).\n\t\tNOTE: The FPLC system used in this study to perform FSEC was in a cold environment and had a five-position loop valve and a six-position plate fraction collector fitted. This setup allows five samples to be loaded and run sequentially down the same column in an automated fashion without requiring manual intervention between the runs. For running the SEC experiments, a commercially available pre-packed 24 mL column was used (see Table of Materials), which contained a resin that allowed proteins in the molecular weight range of 10-600 kDa to be resolved. If the protein of interest is particularly large, an alternative column matrix could be used instead, allowing the separation of proteins up to 5,000 kDa in molecular weight. Please note the presence of detergent/lipid micelle will increase the overall size of the membrane protein by >150 kDa, depending on the protein and detergent used.\nApply the sample to the column, and run the SEC experiment.\n\t\nTransfer the supernatant from the high-speed centrifugation step to a 1 mL syringe using a blunt-ended needle attached to the syringe. This allows for sample recovery from the centrifuge tube without disturbing the pellet.",
    "Set the sample loop to load. Overfill a 500 µL sample loop by injecting 600-700 µL of the sample from the syringe into the loading port. Depending on the system used, this loading step can be programmed into the method to ensure no mistakes are made.\nDuring the method, inject the sample from the loop into the column by emptying it with 4 mL of SEC buffer at the recommended flow rate and pressure for the column (see Table of Materials).\nRun the column at the same flow rate until 1.5 column volumes (36 mL for a 24 mL column) of the buffer have passed down.\nAt 0.25 of the column volume (6 mL for a 24 mL column), start collecting 0.2 mL fractions in order to collect 90 fractions.\n\t\t​NOTE: As the void volume of the column is expected to be 0.3 column volumes, beginning the collection of fractions immediately prior to this ensures that the elution of all the protein is monitored, including any protein present in the void volume.\n4. Fluorescent trace collection and analysis\nTransfer the samples from the fraction collector (step 3.2.5) to a 96-well plate, and read the fluorescent signal.\n\t\nBefore taking a fluorescence reading, dilute the collected samples. Using a multi-channel pipette, transfer 90 µL of laboratory-grade distilled H2O from a reservoir to each well of an opaque flat bottom 96-well plate (see Table of Materials).",
    "If fractions were collected into a 96-well block during step 3.2.5, use a multi-channel pipette to transfer 10 µL of the SEC fractions from the block to the opaque flat bottom 96-well plate, and mix by pipetting up and down. Otherwise, if SEC fractions were collected into individual tubes during step 3.2.5, transfer 10 µL of each fraction to the opaque flat bottom 96-well plate one by one, pipetting up and down each time to mix the samples.\nPlace the opaque flat bottom 96-well plate into the plate reader, and measure the fluorescence. If GFP is the fluorescent label (used here), set the excitation as close as possible to 488 nm, and detect the fluorescent emission as close as possible to 507 nm.\n\t\tNOTE: The dilution required before taking the fluorescence reading will depend on the total amount of protein of interest present in the expression culture and the sensitivity of the plate reader being used. In the examples shown in this study, the samples were diluted 10-fold in water. As a suggestion for a starting point, the fractions should be diluted 5-10-fold in water or buffer before detection. If the recorded FSEC trace signal is particularly low, smaller dilutions or even an undiluted sample can be used instead. The device used for detection in this study was a plate reader capable of excitation at 488 nm and detecting fluorescent emission at 507 nm (see Table of Materials).\nPlot the FSEC traces.\n\t\nExport the data from the plate reader in a raw format (raw text or a comma-separated values file). These raw data will be plotted on the Y-axis of the FSEC trace.",
    "For the X-axis, calculate the volume at which each fraction was collected. The first well needs to be the elution volume at which the first fraction was collected to account for the fractionation delay (6 mL in this example). The fractions after this must sequentially increase by the collected fraction volume (0.2 mL in this example).\nOnce the X-axis and Y-axis data have been calculated, copy and paste the data into the graphing software (see Table of Materials) in order to plot the fluorescent signal in each well against the volume at which it eluted from the column.\n\t\tNOTE: Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of the steps required to run an FSEC experiment.\nAnalyze the FSEC traces.\n\t\nAssess the amount of protein elution at the void volume (approximately 8 mL for a 24 mL column), which indicates that the protein is very large in size and is likely unfolded/aggregated.\nAssess the amount of protein eluting in any later peaks, which indicate folded protein. This is expected to be between 10 mL and 16 mL for a 24 mL column depending on the protein size (when associated with a detergent/lipid micelle). Pay close attention to the peak shape, particularly if it is a broad or split peak spanning greater than 3-4 mL (for a 24 mL column), as this indicates a polydisperse sample.\nCalculate the ratio between the monomeric peak height and the void peak height by dividing the maximum signal recorded in the monomer peak by the maximum signal in the void peak.\n\t\tNOTE: This value represents the monodispersity index and allows a quantitative measure of protein quality; larger values indicate the best possible quality, whereas values below 1 indicate problematic samples, as they have more aggregated protein than folded protein.",
    "If multiple FSEC runs are to be compared and the most important feature is the amount of monomer in each case, plot the traces as the raw signal recorded by the plate reader (e.g., RFU).\n\t\tNOTE: If a comparison of the amount of monomer compared to the unfolded protein is more important, the signal must be normalized to a percentage of the total signal using the minimum and maximum readings in the trace, which will accentuate differences in the ratio between aggregated and monomeric protein between the traces.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64322/64322fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Schematic representation of the steps required to run an FSEC experiment.
