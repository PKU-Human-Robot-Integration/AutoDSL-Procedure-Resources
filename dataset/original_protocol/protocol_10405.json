    "Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the Animal Care Committee guidelines of the Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute.\n1. Scaffold Preparation\nDecellularization of lungs\n\t\nEuthanize adult Wistar rats using CO2 chamber. Place animal in the chamber and start 100% CO2 exposure at a fill rate of 10-30% of chamber volume per minute.\n\t\t\nObserve animal for unconsciousness; this will occur after approximately 2-3 min. If unconsciousness does not occur in this time period, check fill rate and chamber seal. Following unconsciousness, observe animal for faded eye color and lack of respiration. If both are observed, maintain CO2 filling for 1-2 min and then remove animal from chamber for procedure.\nSecure animal to dissecting surface by fixing forepaws and hind legs, and spray down the chest and abdomen area with 70% ethanol. Access the heart and lungs by opening the thoracic cavity using a vertical incision along the sternum.\nMake small incisions through diaphragm first to cause the lungs to retract, reducing the chance of puncturing the lungs. Ligate the inferior vena cava with a suture and place a small incision in the left atrium with small dissecting scissors.\nUsing a prepared 10 ml syringe with a 25 G needle filled with heparinized Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS) (10 U/ml heparin in HBSS), start lung perfusion by inserting the needle into the right ventricle to push the buffer through the pulmonary circulation (rate of 2 ml/min). Continue this procedure until the lungs turn white and the fluid flowing from the left atrium runs clear.\nFollowing perfusion, expose the trachea and cannulate with a plastic catheter near the thyroid cartilage and secure in place with a suture.",
    "Setup a gravity perfusion system by fixing a 10 ml syringe to a retort stand and clamp. Remove and discard syringe plunger. Secure the maximum filling point on syringe barrel at 20 cm above the lungs. Attach a two-way stopcock to the end of the syringe, and a long plastic tubing to the other end of the stopcock for delivering decellularization solution to the cannulated trachea. Pour solution into syringe and allow solution to fill attached plastic tubing and catheter.\n\t\t\nLavage the lungs by filling to total lung capacity (approximately 12 ml) for 1 min and remove the plastic catheter from the trachea to allow the fluid to flow out of the lungs. Do not fill syringe more than 10 ml when lavaging lungs to keep pressure below 20 cm of H2O.\nRepeat lavage of lungs eight times with decellularization solution, followed by 10 rinses with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nDissect the trachea and lungs free from the neck and chest cavity and remove from the animal. Keep tissue in cold PBS at 4 °C until preparation for vibratome sectioning.\nThick section generation\n\t\nPrepare approximately 15 ml of 2% and 4% (w/v) agarose, and enough 6% (w/v) agarose for embedding all lobes into small rectangular blocks. Dissolve low melting point agarose powder in PBS by microwaving. Transfer the agarose to 50 ml tubes on a heat block and maintain temperature above 40 °C to avoid gelling.\nDissect decellularized lung at the end of each lobar bronchus to detach each lobe (cranial, middle, accessory, and caudal right lobes and the left lobe) using small scissors. Pat dry each lobe using absorbent sheets to remove excess PBS and place inside 2% (w/v) agarose while on the heating block.",
    "Remove each lobe after 5 min of coating in agarose, place in a Petri dish and allow the surface to gel for 1 min on a cold plate.\nGently place lobes back into 4% (w/v) agarose, cool after 5 min, and repeat coating once more with the 6% (w/v) agarose.\nAfter sequential coating of each lobe, embed each lobe separately in 6% (w/v) agarose using metal base molds with at least 3 mm of agarose surrounding the tissue from the edges. Orient each lobe using forceps by positioning the lobe's largest flat edge at the surface of metal mold facing the experimenter. This edge will be the side fixed to the specimen plate for vibratome sectioning.\nAllow blocks to gel on cold plate for at least 30 min prior to sectioning with vibratome. Store blocks in a humidified chamber for up to 12 hr at 4 °C prior to vibratome sectioning.\nSetup the vibratome by filling the sectioning chamber with cold PBS12. Maintain cold temperature throughout sectioning with the surrounding ice bath. Remove blocks from metal molds and use a razor blade to trim down excess agarose surrounding lobes, while keeping approximately 3 mm from the edge of the tissue.\nFix tissue to the center of specimen plate using adhesive, and submerge plate into the PBS-filled sectioning chamber. Setup sectioning boundaries on vibratome by selecting the following speed, amplitude, and thickness values respectively: 0.2 mm/sec, 1.85 mm, and 350 µm.\n\t\tNote: Both longitudinal and transverse sections of the lobe orientation are acceptable.\nSection each lobe completely. Manually cut sections free using small scissors if a section is not fully separated by blade at the end of the section sequence. Collect scaffold sections gently and keep in PBS on ice until the next step.",
    "Note: Sections generated will include both the proximal and distal lung areas and both sources can be used for recellularization; however, most of the surface will encompass distal lung.\nDecontamination of scaffold sections\n\t\nTransfer the 350 micron thick scaffold sections from PBS to microcentrifuge tubes (up to 30 sections/tube) and treat with nuclease (90 U/ml in PBS) (see List of Materials) for 12 - 24 hr at RT, on a rotator.\nFollowing nuclease treatment, transfer sections using forceps to new microcentrifuge tubes and treat with antimicrobial solution (200 U/ml penicillin streptomycin and 25 µg/ml amphotericin B in PBS) under sterile conditions for 6 hr at RT, on a rotator.\n\t\tNote: Scaffolds can be stored in antimicrobial solution for up to one week at 4 °C before use.\nFollowing the decontamination step with antimicrobial solution, rinse scaffolds twice with PBS under sterile conditions and transfer to serum free differentiation media (SFDM) prior to seeding with cells.\n2. Endodermal Cell Preparation\nDefinitive Endoderm Induction\n\t\nMaintain mouse ESC lines under feeder-free, serum free culture using 2i conditions13. Start endoderm induction by removing cells from adherent pluripotent culture by trypsinization.\nResuspend cells in SFDM and seed at a density of 20,000 cells/ml in low adherent plates for three days without media change to allow for EB formation.\nAfter three days gently transfer the EBs into 50 ml conical tubes using a 10 ml pipette and allow them to collect at the bottom for 3 min at RT.\nCarefully aspirate media and add fresh SFDM media supplemented with 50 ng/ml activin A.\nSeed cells back onto the low adherent plates at a 1:2 density and culture for three additional days to achieve definitive endoderm differentiation.\nDefinitive endoderm enrichment",
    "Collect day 6 EBs, dissociate with trypsin and label for c-KIT and CXCR4 expression using conjugated fluorescent antibodies14.\nSort labeled cells using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for expression of both markers to obtain an enriched definitive endoderm population15.\n3. Recellularization Setup\nAir-liquid interface culture setup\n\t\nTransfer each decellularized scaffold section (step 1.2.9) from SFDM onto a hydrophobic floating membrane (8 µm pore size) using sterile forceps. Ensure scaffold sections are spread evenly on membrane.\nPrepare 6- or 12-well plates by filling wells with 1 or 0.5 ml of SFDM, respectively. Gently place membranes into wells, allowing the membrane to float on top of media, creating an air-liquid culture setup.\nSeeding of 3D scaffolds\n\t\nFollowing FACS for definitive endoderm markers (step 2.2.2) count sorted cells using a hemocytometer, spin down at 400 x g for 5 min and resuspend in SFDM. Resuspend cells to obtain a volume containing approximately 100,000 cells/10 µl/scaffold.\nTo recellularize scaffolds, pipette 10 µl of cells directly onto each prepared section from step 3.1.2.\nReplace SFDM media in cultures every 48 hr. Aspirate the old media by holding the plate at a slight incline to avoid disrupting the culture. Slowly add fresh SFDM to culture along the side of the well to prevent sinking of floating membrane.\nMaintain air-liquid cultures for up to 21 days to achieve differentiation of seeded cells in to mature airway epithelia.\n\t\tNote: Recellularized sections can be processed for tissue staining and immunofluorescent (IF) microscopy at any time point during cell culture16.\nSubscription Required.
