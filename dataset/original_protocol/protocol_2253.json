Keep VTN coated 6-well/T-75 or T150 flasks ready.\nSet up differentiation:\nThe day of seeding is termed as Day-2 (day minus 2).\nUse iPSC culture with 60%–70% confluency. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nAspirate E8 media, wash cells with 3 mL of DPBS.\nAdd 1 mL of TrypLE to each well of 6-well plate.\nIncubate the plate in 37°C incubator for 5–6 min.\nCheck the plate after 2–3 min, and as soon as the cells in the iPSC colonies start rounding off (become brighter), start collecting cells in TrypLE using a 5 mL serological pipette.\nWash the plate with E8 plating media, and collect the cell suspension in a 50 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge at 400 g for 5 min.\nCritical: Avoid using 1 mL pipette (always use 5 mL serological pipette) to collect the cell suspension as it affects the viability and hence negatively affects the differentiation.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 5 mL (do not use I mL pipette) of E8 plating media.\nCount cells using ViCell automated cell counter at proper cell counting settings. Use the viable cell count for seeding cells for differentiation.\nCritical: This protocol is optimized on cell count from ViCell instrument specifically. There could be variation in cell counts when compared to other cell counters. However, this protocol works well on a range of cell densities.",
    "Start with 200K/well seeding density but the protocol is optimized for a range of 200–400K cells/well of a 6 well plate.\nAdd 3 mL of E8 plating media with cell suspension and bring the plates to the incubator.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1860_17.csv\nMake sure to rock the plate in orthogonal directions to ensure even distribution of cells in every well.\nCritical: Homogenous distribution of cells is a necessary event to have a good efficiency in differentiation process.\nThe health of iPSC culture - dead cells, spontaneously differentiating cells, homogenous size of colonies, all affect the efficiency of differentiation. Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1860-Fig1.jpg\nFigure1. Morphology of iPSC colonies for setting up RPE differentiation\n(A and B) iPSC colonies ready to be used for differentiation. The culture should be more homogeneous with minimum dead cell floating and compact colonies.\n(C and D) iPSC colonies that should not be used for RPE differentiation. Heterogenous colony size (blue arrowheads), high cell death, and spiky cells (white arrowheads) lead to poor differentiation.\nScale bar, 200 μm.\nCritical: When working with a new iPSC line, set up three different seeding densities (200 K, 300 K and 400 K cells/well of a 6 well plate) for the first round of differentiation.\nDay -1: Change the media with E8 complete media.\nNote: Make sure to aspirate the media from the corner of the well to avoid damaging cells or aspirating them off. Dispense media slowly from the edge of the well.\nDay 0 and Day 1: Prepare RIM media. Change E8 media with 3 mL of RIM media/well of 6-well plate for two days. Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1860-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Morphology of iPSC cells transition to RIM phase: Day 2 to day 1",
    "(A and B) Differentiating cells at day-1 (A) and day 0 (B). The cells at day-1 are spiky because of the blebbistatin in culture media. The images represent good density and morphology of differentiating cells.\n(C and D) Differentiating cells at day 0. The arrowheads represent the abnormal morphology that should be avoided in day 0 cells. The probable reason for such morphologies is the excessive use of TrypLE and mechanical force during passaging.\nScale bar, 200 μm.\nDay 2–10 RDM: From day 2 to day 10, feed RDM media every day. Add 3 mL of RDM medium to each well. Be careful while changing the media, make sure you are not aspirating off or damaging the cells. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCritical: Sometimes cells start to peel from the corners of the 6 well, keep the speed of aspiration of media and dispense speed low and if the whole well is peeling it indicates the issues with health of iPSC culture used to set up differentiation.\nNote: The last couple of days of RDM may show some cell death in culture plates. This is part of the differentiation process, and it indicates an enrichment process towards RPE cells. Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1860-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Morphology of differentiating cells in RDM phase: Day 2 to day 10\n(A and B) Differentiating cells at day 5 (A) and day 10 (B). At day 10, expect lot of cell death indicating the priming to RPE fate. The differentiation runs lacking the cell death at the end of RDM phase often brings poor efficiency.\nScale bar, 200 μm.",
    "Day 11–20 RMNA: From day 11 to day 20, feed RMNA media every day. Add 3 mL of RMNA medium to each well. Be careful while changing the media, make sure you are not aspirating off or damaging the cells. At the end of RMNA, neuronal clusters will start to appear in wells which is a positive sign indicating that cells differentiated into RPE. Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1860-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Morphology of differentiating cells in RMNA phase: Day 11 to day 20\n(A and B) Differentiating cells at day 16 (A) and day 20 (B). At day 20, appearance of little bumps of neuronal clusters (arrowhead marked) indicates successful run. The flat land around bumps RPE progenitor cells.\n(C and D) Images of bad cultures at day 16 (A) and day 20 (B). The opaque cultures lacking any islands of neuronal islands end up dying at the end of day 20, i.e., RMNA phase.\nScale bar, 20 μm.\nCritical: From day 13–18, there is high cell death rate in the culture because of the enrichment of differentiating RPE cells. Don’t panic when seeing cell death at this stage.",
    "Day 21–25 5% RPE: From day 21, feed the media every other day. Add 3 mL of 5% RPE medium to each well. At this stage you will start to see flat areas with RPE progenitor cells with islands of neuronal clusters. Pigment also starts to appear in these 4 days of media change. The non-RPE cells will die off in this phase. In extreme cases of failed differentiation, the whole well peels off as a layer. In case of mixed cultures of RPE and non-RPE cells, there will be some signs of peeling; if that happens its recommended to collect cells at day 23 or day 24. At this stage cells can be either frozen down or plated for MACS purification and enrichment. Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] and Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1860-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Scale bar, 200 μm.\n(D) RPE progenitor cells at day 25.\n(E) Reseeded cells at day 27.\n(F) Immature RPE cells before MACS purification. The images in this panel represent the bad differentiation run with no appearance of neuronal clusters at day 25 (D) and only neurons at day 27.\nScale bar, 200 μm.\nCritical: Make sure to bring all different media to room temperature before using them.",
    "Peeling off cells during RIM and RDM stage could happen because of several reasons: Nunc plates were not used; vitronectin coating was not done correctly; iPSC cells were not maintained well or medium change was not done carefully. Be careful to set the dispense speed on pipetman at 2 or 3 before adding the medium to the wells. Always add or aspirate the medium from the edge of the well.\nPeeling off cells could also happen during the last phase of 5% RPE, be careful while changing media.\nSome morphological signs about the differentiation: noticeable cell death at the end of RDM and the beginning of the RMNA phase. That is a good sign. It tells that non-RPE primed cells are dying off.\nBig holes in the differentiation plate during the 5% RPE medium step and complete peeling off signal that the culture was full of neurons. Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1860-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Morphology of differentiating cells at day 25\n(A) Differentiating cells at day 25, the big holes in the. monolayer of differentiating cells indicates the failed run and that the culture is full of neurons. Scale bar, 200 μm.\nThe color of the day 25 pellet will give an indication of the efficiency of differentiation. Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]. Off-white pellet suggests cultures cull of neurons (BAD differentiation), brown to black pellet suggests differentiating RPE cells (GOOD differentiation).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1860-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

The steps will cover preparing LD columns and cells for staining.",
    "The quality of the differentiation run is critical to ensure the successful Day25 (RPE progenitors) replating. The replating process gets rid of neuronal clusters. Prepare MACS Buffer, RPE plating media, permeabilization buffer, fixation buffer and FACS buffer.\nDay 25 replating for MACS purification.\nPrepare RPE plating media and vitronectin coated flasks.\nAspirate the 5% RPE medium and wash the well twice with DPBS - 2 mL/well of a 6-well plate.\nAspirate DPBS and add 1 mL of TrypLE to each well of 6-well plate and incubate at 37°C for 5 min. This will remove neuronal clusters. Take the plate out from incubator and start tapping gently to get rid of neuronal clusters. Aspirate TrypLE and perform two DPBS washes.\nAdd 1 mL of TrypLE and leave in incubator for 15 more minutes. Collect the cells with 5 mL serological pipette and pool cells in a 50 mL conical tube. Wash the wells with RPE plating media, pool all media and centrifuge the conical tube at 400 g for 5 min.\nNote: If the quality of differentiation run is poor, all cells start to detach as a monolayer, and the process will not need the second step of TrypLE. On the other hand, in case of good quality differentiation runs, the RPE progenitors come off after the 15 min TrypLE incubation.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend cells in 5–10 mL of plating media.\nPass the cell suspension through 20 μm steriflip cell strainer. Count the cells using ViCell counter (expect 5–6 million cells/mL). Seed cells at 24–30 million in T75 flask in 20 mL of RPE plating media. The yield of RPE progenitors varies from 100–120 million cells/75cm2. Keep the flask in incubator.\nFor replated cultures, 48 h after seeding, change medium using room temperature equilibrated 5% RPE media.",
    "Flasks are fed every other day.\nFreezing Day 25/RPE progenitors:\nAspirate the media and wash cells twice with DPBS (without calcium and magnesium) with 2 mL/well of 6-well plate.\nAspirate DPBS and add TrypLE (1 mL/well of a 6 well-plate).\nIncubate at 37°C for ∼5 min.

    "Incubate at 37°C for 40–50 min.\nNote: Check the flask under the microscope after 30 min, cells derived from some iPSC lines come off easier than others. Longer TrypLE incubation reduces the viability and hence will negatively affect the yield.\nAfter incubation, collect cells using a 5 mL serological pipet. Collect the cell suspension in a 50 mL conical tube. Wash each well with enough room temperature equilibrated 5% RPE Plating Medium. Centrifuge the cells at 400 g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 10 mL of room temperature 5% RPE Plating Medium.\nFilter the cell suspension using a 20 μm steriflip cell strainer.\nCount number of cells using ViCell.

TER across the iRPE monolayers is measured using commercially available Epithelial Volt/Ohm Meter (EVOM2, WPI).\nEVOM2: The electrodes in the form of chopsticks (STX2, WPI) were applied on the apical and basal sides of iRPE, the current was passed, and resistance values (Ohms) were noted down for each condition. Actual resistance (Ohms.cm2) is calculated by multiplying TER by area of measurement (12 mm diameter transwell in this case)."
