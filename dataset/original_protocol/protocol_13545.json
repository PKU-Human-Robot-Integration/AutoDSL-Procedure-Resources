  "procedures": [
    "The protocol was carried out in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration and all the methods described here have been approved by the ethics committee of Daping Hospital and written consent was obtained from the patients.\n1. Instruments for operation\nConduct all the procedures under an operating microscope with 5-10x magnification to achieve precise anastomoses and anatomic reconstruction.\n2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria\nUse the following inclusion criteria: patients who experience penile glans amputation during circumcision; the injury of penile glans mainly contains glans and/or distal urethra.\nUse the following exclusion criteria: penile amputation; injured not during circumcision or by disposable stapler; secondary stage repair.\n3. Preparation for operation\nTie a rubber band at the root of the penis to stop bleeding in advance.\nKeep the amputated glans in the sterile ice-cold saline during the transfer and before replantation.\n\t\nOnce the glans is amputated, do not discard it.\nImmerse the amputated glans in about 10-20 mL of sterile normal saline (preferably sterile ice-cold saline), and wrap it with two layers of sterile gloves.\nPlace it in an ice bucket or vacuum cup with ice and transfer it to a hospital where microsurgery can be performed as soon as possible.\nRinse and disinfect the amputated glans with iodophor three times before replantation.\nGive antibiotics intravenously 30 mins before surgery. Use cefuroxime sodium 0.50-0.75 g with 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution according to patient's weight.\n4. Procedure\nRepairment of the amputated penile glans and frenulum if applicable.\n\t\nRemove the amputated glans from the preserved ice bag and disinfect. Observe the morphology and integrity of the glans under the microscope. If there is fragmentation, repair it first (Figure 1A).",
    "Apply 8-0 non-absorbable thread to suture the inner cavernous incision of the glans (Figure 1B). Meanwhile, use 6-0 absorbable thread to suture the tears on the surface of the glans (Figure 1C).\nTrim the alongside frenulum if applicable.\nEnd-to-end urethral anastomosis\n\t\nPut the patient in a supine position.\nObserve and evaluate the damage of the stump of glans under the microscope (Figure 1D), and align the amputated glans and frenulum with the stump of glans. Insert an 8 Fr. Foley catheter via the urethral orifice for the drainage of urine (Figure 1E).\nPerform end-to-end urethral anastomosis using 6-0 absorbable thread through the intermittent suture method with precise positioning. Usually, suture one stitch at 12:00 and 6:00 o'clock of the urethra, respectively at first, and then on the base of two positioning points; suture about four stitches tightly on the left and right sides, respectively in a counterclockwise or clockwise direction (Figure 1F).\nAnastomosis of amputated glans surface and reconstruction of the frenulum\n\t\nSuture the edge of amputated glans to the edge of the penile stump using 6-0 absorbable thread. Suture a few fixed points at 6, 12, 9, and 3 o'clock at first, and then suture the space between the fixed points with a space of 1 mm for each to achieve a precise anastomosis (Figure 1G).\nTrim the excess inner plate of prepuce on the ventral side of the penile glans if applicable.\nReconstruct the frenulum by intermittent suture to achieve a satisfactory shape if applicable (Figure 1H,I).\n5. Postoperative care\nEvaluate the recovery of local blood circulation by closely observing the color of the replanted penile glans.",
    "NOTE: A dark red glans is expected (cherry pulp-like) and it should be observed dynamically. There are some blackish crusts on the surface after days and make sure not to remove them. Blackish crust does not mean necrosis of the amputated glans.\nMaintain postoperative intravenous antibiotic treatment for 2-3 days and change to oral treatment for 5-7 days.\nKeep the drainage of indwelling catheter unobstructed and remove it 1-2 weeks after the operation.\nSubscription Required.
