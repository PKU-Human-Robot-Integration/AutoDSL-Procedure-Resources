    "All animal procedures demonstrated in this protocol have been reviewed and approved by the Dongguk University Ilsan Hospital Animal Care and Use Committee and conducted in accordance with the principles and procedures outlined in the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Animals.\n1. Preparation of Exogenously Formed Clot Labeled with Fluorescence Marker (Figure 1)\nAnesthetize a mouse in an induction chamber using 3% isoflurane mixed with 30% oxygen (1.5 L/min 100% oxygen). Ensure adequate depth of anesthesia by observing muscle tone and confirming the absence of the toe pinch reflex.\nPlace the animal on a sterile drape in prone position, and keep it under anesthesia using an inhalation mask and 2% isoflurane mixed with 30% oxygen. Perform the following procedures using aseptic techniques and sterile gowns / masks / gloves / instruments. Maintain sterile conditions by cleaning and sanitizing the experimental area with 70% alcohol before and after the procedures.\nCollect about 300 ~ 1,000 µl arterial blood after cardiac puncture6. Mix 70 µl whole blood with 30 µl C15 probe5 (20 µmol/L concentration), a Cy5.5 fluorescent probe sensitive to the fibrin-crosslinking activity of activated factor XIII (FXIIIa) coagulation enzyme, to fluorescently mark the clot (Figure 1A). Inject the mixed blood using a 3 ml syringe (23 gauge needle) into a 20 cm long polyethylene tube (PE-50, I.D. 0.58 mm). PE tubing must be sterilized (or certified sterile by manufacturer) and the clots must be prepared aseptically in a tissue culture hood.\nVerify the animal's death by observing the lack of respiration and cardiac pulse.\nLeave the blood-loaded tube at room temperature for 2 hr, then at 4 °C for 22 hr, and perform the following procedures, as previously reported7.",
    "Cut the thrombus-containing tube into 1.5 cm-long pieces. Using a 3 ml syringe filled with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), expel thrombus onto a PBS-containing 6-well plate by gently injecting PBS into each piece of tube. Wash the thrombi three times with PBS (Figure 1B).\nLoad the distal end portion of a 15 cm-long PE-10 tube (I.D. 0.28 mm) with a 1.5 cm-long thrombus by carefully drawing the washed thrombus, while avoiding air bubbles, using a saline-filled 1 ml syringe with a 30 gauge needle that is inserted into the proximal end of the tube.\nConnect the thrombus-loaded PE-10 tube with a 3 cm long PE-50 tube (I.D. 0.58 mm) modified to have a tapered end (I.D. 200 µm), which will be placed on the middle cerebral artery (MCA) – anterior cerebral artery (ACA) bifurcation area of the internal carotid artery (ICA) in a mouse model of embolic stroke (Figure 1C).\n2. Modeling a Mouse Model of Thromboembolic Stroke (Figure 2)\nAnesthetize a different mouse to be stroked as previously reported7 in an induction chamber using 3% isoflurane mixed with 30% oxygen (1.5 L/min). Inject meloxicam (5 mg/kg) subcutaneously to relieve post-surgical pain. Ensure adequate depth of anesthesia by observing muscle tone and confirming the absence of the toe pinch reflex.\nApply a small amount of veterinary ointment to each eye to prevent dryness during anesthesia. Perform the following surgical procedures using aseptic techniques and sterile gowns / masks / gloves / instruments. Maintain sterile conditions by cleaning and sanitizing the surgical area with 70% alcohol before, during, and after the surgery.",
    "Move the mouse to an operating table. Place the animal on a sterile drape in prone position, and keep it under anesthesia using an inhalation mask and 2% isoflurane. Then, clamp the body temperature at 36.5 °C using a homeothermic blanket with feedback from a rectal thermometer.\nAfter surgical prep with betadine and 70% alcohol, make a 1 cm vertical incision by using a scalpel on the scalp between the left ear and eye. Glue the distal end of the optical fiber of a laser Doppler flowmeter onto the exposed left temporal bone surface (1 mm left and 4 mm below from the bregma). Then, start Doppler flow monitoring (Figure 2A).\nLay down the animal. Straighten the neck by pulling on the upper front tooth with a string attached to a pin and shave the neck area. Then, make a 3 cm vertical midline incision, spread it open, and expose the left carotid bulb area by dissecting peri-vascular soft tissues. Be careful not to injure the vagus nerve.\nLigate the left proximal common carotid artery (CCA) using a sterile 6-0 black silk suture, and ligate the left ICA and the left pterygopalatine artery (PPA) using sterile 7-0 black silk sutures.\nCauterize the left superior thyroid artery, which is a branch of the left external carotid artery using a monopolar electrical cautery, and ligate the left proximal external carotid artery (ECA) loosely and the more distal site tightly using sterile 7-0 black silk sutures.\nUsing a micro-scissor, make a small hole (about 0.2 ~ 0.25 µm diameter) between the ligated sites of the ECA.\nInsert the thrombus-containing catheter into the hole in the ECA while loosening the proximal ECA ligation. Tighten the proximal ECA ligation again after advancing the catheter into the CCA in order to cinch the catheter in place.",
    "Cauterize to cut the ECA distal part, which is distal to the distal ligation site, and rotate the free proximal ECA clockwise to align it to the direction of the ICA while withdrawing the catheter from the CCA. Then, advance the catheter about 9 mm into the MCA − ACA bifurcation area of the distal ICA immediately after loosening the ICA ligation. Then, tighten the ICA ligation.\nPlace the thrombus into the bifurcation area by gently pressing the syringe 1 ml to inject the thrombus. Check the decrease of Doppler cerebral blood flow (CBF), which should be lowered by 30% or lower compared to baseline, if the thrombus successfully occluded the vessel (Figure 2B).\nRemove the catheter, and ligate the ECA proximal site immediately and tightly. In addition, unligate the CCA and the PPA.\nClose the incision site using 6-0 silk sutures. Stop anesthesia after continuing the Doppler monitoring over a required time span (here, for 30 min after thrombus injection). Return the mouse in an empty cage, and keep it warm with a heating lamp. Do not leave the mouse unattended until it has gained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\n3. In Vivo MicroCT Imaging of Cerebral Thrombus (Figure 3)\nRe-anesthetize the mouse with 2% isoflurane as described in the step 2.1 at a pre-specified time-point (here, 1 hr) following the onset of embolic stroke due to the placement of thrombus in the cerebral artery. Ensure adequate depth of anesthesia by confirming the absence of the toe pinch reflex. Apply a small amount of veterinary ointment to each eye to prevent dryness during anesthesia.",
    "Resuspend fibrin-targeted gold nanoparticles (fib-GC-AuNP4) at a concentration of 10 mg Au/ml in 10 mM PBS, and sonicate the thrombus imaging agent for 30 min to ensure dissolution and dispersion of the nanoparticles. Inject 300 µl fib-GC-AuNP (10 mg/ml) into the penile vein.\nPlace the animal on the bed of a microCT machine, and straighten the neck by pulling the upper front tooth with a string attached to a pin to reduce motion artifacts.\nAt 5 min after the injection of fib-GC-AuNP, begin to obtain microCT images of the brain. For the experiments described here, use the following imaging parameters: 65 kVp, 60 µA, 26.7 x 26.7 x 27.9 mm3 field of view, 0.053 x 0.053 x 0.054 mm3 voxel size, 100 milliseconds per frame, 1 averaging, 360 views, 512 x 512 reconstruction matrix, 600 slices, 64 sec scan time.\nReturn the mouse in an empty cage, and keep it warm with a heating lamp. Do not leave the mouse unattended until it has gained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\nTransform the raw image data into Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format using the 'Start' command of the 'Reconstruction' panel in a software package installed on the microCT scanner.\nFor quantitative analyses of the images (in step 6), transform the DICOM data into TIFF format by using a commercially available software package according to manufacturer's instructions.\nFor qualitative analyses as well as quantitative analyses in a simpler and more rapid way, use the software package and the original 0.054 mm thick images in DICOM format for generating a new set of axial and coronal images rendered to have 1 or 2 mm (here, 2 mm) thickness, as follows.",
    "Select the DICOM folder on the 'Data Source' tree, click the right mouse button, and import the folder to 'MasterDB' or 'PrivateDB'.\nClick the 'MasterDB' or 'PrivateDB' in the 'Data Source' tree, and select the imported folder. After clicking the '3D' tab on the leftmost panel, when the 'Loading Options' window pops up, press 'OK' to import a sequence of images in the folder as a stack.\nChange the image representation to maximum intensity projection (MIP) format by clicking the word 'MRP' in the axial and coronal image windows and choosing 'MIP' on the pop-up menu. Then, change the image thickness to 2 mm after clicking 'TH : 0 [mm]' in the same windows.\nUsing the 2 mm width 3D navigator bar that allows for exploring an image stack and slicing it at an appropriate angle and location, prepare a 2 mm thick axial section image with full coverage of the circle of Willis (COW), which harbors thrombi. Click the capture button (camera icon) on the 'Output' panel. Save the image in TIFF format.\nThen, prepare five 2 mm thick coronal section images that cover contiguously from the frontal lobe to the cerebellum.\n\t\nFirst, prepare the second slice by carefully aligning the navigator bar on the axial image so that the coronal image can best visualize the MCA − ACA thrombi.\nNext, prepare the other four slices in a contiguous way. Click the capture button (camera icon) on the 'Output' panel. Save the images in TIFF format.\n4. Thrombolysis and In Vivo MicroCT Imaging of Cerebral Thrombus (Figure 3)",
    "Prepare a 100 cm long PE-10 tube with a 30 gauge needle on one end and a 1 ml syringe on the other end. Fill the tube with either saline (600 µl) or tPA (here, 24 mg/kg, 600 µl) while avoiding air bubbles.\nRe-anesthetize the mouse as described in the step 2.1. Insert the needle tip within the penile vein of the animal. Place the animal carefully onto the bed of the microCT machine. Then, immobilize and stabilize the intravenously injected part of the catheter system by taping it to the bed.\nPerform a follow-up imaging session as pre-treatment baseline. Then, inject either 60 µl normal saline or tPA by depressing the syringe plunger into the catheter system. After the bolus injection, begin to infuse the remaining solution (540 µl) over a period of time (here, 30 min).\nObtain microCT images using the same parameters as in the step 3.4 at pre-specified time-points: here, at 3 and 24 hr after the bolus injection. To perform the following ex vivo NIRF thrombus imaging of the brain, euthanize the animal under anesthesia by cervical dislocation.\n5. Ex Vivo NIRF Thrombus Imaging and Triphenyl Tetrazolium Chloride (TTC) Staining of the Brain Tissue (Figure 4)\nAfter decapitation, remove the scalp and cut through the skull with scissors from the foramen magnum up toward the sagittal suture. Remove the cranial vault by carefully elevating the edges of the incised skull using scissors while avoiding injury to the underlying brain, thus laying bare the hemispheres.",
    "Cut out the optic nerves in the brain base as close as possible to the brain surface, because they could overlap with the circle of Willis arteries that should be visualized on NIRF imaging. Then, in order to clearly visualize the Y-shape 'MCA / ACA / distal ICA' for the NIRF thrombus imaging, cut out the distal ICAs as far as possible to the brain surface after gently compressing the cerebellar base to expose the cutting points (Figure 4A).\nPerform NIRF imaging (excitation / emission, 675 / 690 nm; 1 sec exposure) of the removed brain tissue with its base pointing up (Figure 4B, C), which visualizes the fluorescently labeled thromboemboli in the arteries of the COW (Figure 4D). Then, perform additional imaging with the vertex of the brain pointing up, which visualizes cortical thromboemboli. Avoid drying of the brain by putting a few drops of saline on the tissue.\nUsing a brain matrix device according to the manufacturer's instructions, quickly prepare 2 mm thick brain slices coronally: 6 pieces of 2 mm thick slices (2.3, 0.3, -1.7, -3.7, -5.7 mm from the bregma). Avoid drying of the brain slices by using saline drops, and perform NIRF imaging of both the front and back surface of the sections.\nPut the brain slices in 2% triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) solution for 20 min, while avoiding exposure to light. Then, move the slices into 4% formaldehyde solution at 4 °C, while avoiding exposure to light.\n6. Quantification of Thrombus Area Using MicroCT Images and ImageJ (1.49d) Software (Figure 5)\nOpen Images (Figure 5A).\n\t\nOpen image sequence files to create a stack file by choosing 'File > Import > Image Sequence' or 'File > Open'. Convert the images to 8-bit grayscale by using 'Image > Type > 8-bit'.",
    "Convert the Unit from Inch to Millimeter (Figure 5A).\n\t\nWhen one pixel of CT image files corresponds to 0.053 mm, use 'Analyze > Set Scale' to enter '1', '0.053', and 'mm' for 'Distance in pixels', 'Known distance', and 'Unit of length', respectively.\nWhen (only) a scale bar is available, using the 'Straight Line' tool draw a line with its length equal to that of the scale bar. Then, use 'Analyze > Set Scale' to enter the length of the scale bar in millimeter.\nBackground Subtraction (Figure 5B)\n\t\nBy using 'Edit> Selection> Specify' place a circular or rectangular region of interest (ROI) on an area of the brain parenchyma without thrombus or bone-related hyperdense regions. Because the specified ROI applies to every slice of the stack, check to be sure if it is not overlapped with hyperdense regions in each slice.\nChoose 'Plugin > ROI > BG subtraction from ROI' and enter 2.0 for the 'Number of stdev from mean'.\nSegmentation of Thromboemboli-related Hyperdense Lesions (Figure 5C)\n\t\nChoose 'Image > Adjust > Threshold', and enter the values of 'Lower Threshold Level' and 'Upper Threshold Level' as 22 and 255, respectively. Select 'Over/Under' to display pixels below the lower threshold value in blue, thresholded pixels in grayscale, and pixels above the upper threshold value in green.\nUse the 'Freehand Selection Tool' to draw ROIs that surround thromboemboli-related hyperdense lesions without including bony areas. During the drawing, keep pressing either [shift] or [alt] to add or remove a region, respectively.\n\t\tNote: If hyperdense thromboembolic lesions are distant from bony structures, instead of the 'Freehand Selection Tool', 'Wand Tool' can safely be used without changing its 'Tolerance' level.\nQuantification of the Segmented Lesions (Figure 5D)",
    "Use 'Analyze > Set Measurements' to choose 'Area', 'Mean Gray Value', and 'Integrated Density (Area X Mean)'. Check the following options: 'Limit to Threshold' and 'Display Label'. Use 'Analyze > Measure' to get the quantified data. Then, save the results as a \".xls\" file.\nSave the stack file in TIFF format. In addition, use 'Analyze > Tools > ROI manager' to save the ROIs.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
