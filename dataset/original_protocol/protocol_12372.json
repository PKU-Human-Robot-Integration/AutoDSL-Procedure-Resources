    "The animal experiments were approved by the appropriate state committees for animal welfare (Landesamt für Gesundheit und Soziales, Berlin) and were performed in accordance with current guidelines and regulations (animal experiment license G0194/11).\n1. Generation of Fluorescent Bone Marrow Chimeric Mice\nNOTE: The generation of fluorescent bone marrow chimeric mice to visualize bone marrow stromal cells is performed as described before9.\nStart treating Del-Cre x ROSA-tdRFP mice (mice expressing tandem red fluorescent protein (tdRFP) ubiquitously11-13) to prepare them for irradiation. Alternatively, use any other strain with ubiquitous expression of fluorescent protein. Administer 1 mg/ml of Neomycin and 1 mg/ml of vitamins (A, D3, E, C) via the drinking water two days before irradiation.\nIrradiate mice twice with 3.8 Gray with a Cesium-137 gamma-irradiator within an interval of 3 hr. For this, place mice in an irradiation pie cage suitable for the respective irradiator.\n\tNOTE:  For irradiation of mice, our Institute does not require anesthesia.  Follow local Institutional policies regarding anesthesia for irradiation. Treat animals with 5 mg/kg of carprofen subcutaneously (s.c.) per day after the irradiation if there are signs of pain.\nThe next day, reconstitute mice by an intravenous injection of 3 x 106 bone marrow cells prepared from long bones of C57BL/6 donor mice in transfer buffer9. Keep the mice on Neomycin and vitamins for up to 2 weeks and monitor their well-being and weight during this time. Wait at least 4 weeks to allow for reconstitution of the immune system before starting the specific experimental treatments (e.g., immunization)9.\nSacrifice mice and place them on a dissection board, sterilize the legs with 70% ethanol. Euthanize mice in accordance with local Institutional policies.  Our Institute performs cervical dislocation.",
    "Use forceps and scissors to remove the skin from the thighs. Remove muscle tissue to expose the femoral bone. Luxate the femoral bone from the hip and knee joint using forceps and scissors. Be careful not to break or cut the bone.\nCarefully remove remaining large pieces of muscle tissue and cartilage from the bone using scissors. Remove remaining muscle tissue by rubbing the bone with laboratory tissue paper. Collect the cleaned bones in a petri dish with phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\nFix whole femoral bones in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, electron microscopy-grade) for 4 - 6 hr.\nDiscard PFA and incubate bones in 10% sucrose in PBS O/N. The next day, incubate the bones in 20% sucrose O/N. The day after, incubate the bones in 30% sucrose O/N.\n2. Cryosectioning of Bones\nNOTE: After 16 - 24 hr in 30% sucrose, freeze bones and cryosection them according to Kawamoto’s tape method14,15.\nPrepare a large beaker (2,000 ml volume) with dry ice and acetone (approximately 2:1 volume ratio, e.g., 400 ml of dry ice and 200 ml of acetone) under a fume hood. Place a small beaker (150 - 250 ml volume) with hexane inside (30 - 50 ml approximately). Wait for the mix to cool down (approximately 10 min, until frost appears on the outside of the large beaker).\nFill ¾ of the labeled cryomold with Super Cryoembedding Medium (SCEM); carefully place the bones inside until they are fully immersed, taking care that they do not touch the edges of the mold. With large forceps hold the cryomold into the beaker with the bottom of the mold just touching the surface of the hexane.",
    "Let the outer edges of the SCEM freeze (indicated by opacity, this takes approximately 15 sec). Then fully drop the mold into the hexane and let it freeze for 1 - 2 min. Take out the frozen sample and wrap in cellophane and then aluminum foil (to protect the sample from drying out and to avoid exposure to light). Store at -80 °C until cryosectioning.\nFor cryosectioning of femoral bones use a standard microtome and microtome blades for hard tissues.\nSet the sample and blade temperature of the microtome to -24 °C. Let the sample sit inside the microtome for about 15 min before cutting.\n\t\nFix the sample block to the metal sample holder with SCEM or optimal cutting temperature (OCT) medium. Adjust the orientation of the block if necessary. Trim the sample until the bone is fully opened and the marrow is visible. Adjust the section thickness to 7 µm (discard the first section).\nFix a piece of Kawamoto tape with the sticky side on the top of the sample block using a deer leather-covered wooden spatula. Subsequently, cut the sample and turn the tape so that the section is positioned on the top side. Transfer the tape to a slide glass using forceps. Fix the tape to the slide glass with Scotch tape.\nLet sections dry for at least 30 min and store them at -80 °C until usage. Store unstained and unmounted slides in plastic slide boxes with spacers between single slides in order to avoid that they stick together. Stained and mounted slides can be stored for up to a week in cardboard slide folders at 4 °C.\n3. Image Collection\nThaw and stain cryosections according to common immunofluorescence protocols9. Include a nuclear stain, e.g., 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) to visualize tissue integrity.",
    "NOTE: Stain, for example, for RFP to visualize stromal cells (anti-RFP-biotin antibody and streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 555), stain eosinophils with rat anti-major basic protein (MBP) antibody and anti-rat-Alexa Fluor 647 antibody, B cells with rat anti-B220-Alexa Fluor 594 antibody and PCs with anti-κ light chain-fluorescein-iso-thiocyanate (FITC) and anti-λ1 light chain-FITC antibodies (details of the staining procedure are described in9).\nMount stained sections: put one drop of fluoromount on the section and then cover with a #1 glass cover slip, whilst carefully avoiding the formation of air bubbles. Subsequently, perform laser scanning confocal microscopy with an instrument equipped with laser lines suitable for the staining.\nIn order to record images for automated co-localization analysis of bone marrow hematopoietic cells with stromal cells using the Wimasis tool, apply the following settings:\n\t\nUse a 20X objective lens and a field of view of 708.15 x 708.15 µm. For automated analysis, keep the size of all images consistent at 2,048 x 2,048 pixel (px) in order to keep the results comparable.\nRecord one channel for stromal structures (e.g., 561 nm laser line), one channel for nuclei (e.g., DAPI, 405 nm) and additional channels for the hematopoietic cells of interest (e.g., 3 channels, 488/594/633 nm for eosinophils, B cells and PCs).\nRecord images using line averaging 4 16. Ideally, cover the whole femoral section by taking single adjacent images. Alternatively, take non-adjacent pictures from various regions of the bone marrow (diaphyseal as well as epiphyseal).\n\t\tNOTE: Be careful not to produce overlaps between adjacent images (to avoid repeated analysis of cells in the overlapping areas).\nSave the images in a microscopy image file format. Check and, if necessary, adjust contrast for all channels in the image viewer/analysis software.",
    "Export 3 .jpg files per image file: one .jpg file for the DAPI channel (red/green/blue (RGB) format, false color coded in yellow), one .jpg file for the stroma channel (greyscale) and one .jpg file containing the channels for hematopoietic cells (3 channels maximum, RGB format, e.g., FITC (PCs, false color: green)/ Alexa Fluor 594 (B cells, false color: blue) / Alexa Fluor 647 (eosinophils, false color: red)).\n4. Automated Image Analysis\nUse an image analysis tool to perform image segmentation, quantification of co-localization and neighborhood analysis (see Discussion).\nIf using the Wimasis tools, proceed as follows:\n\t\nUpload the sets of 3 .jpg files per image with the same file name followed by an underline and a number indicating the type of the image.\nUse _1 for the .jpg file with hematopoietic cells, _2 for the .jpg file for the DAPI channel, _3 for the .jpg file for the stroma channel. For example: Image1_1.jpg (hematopoietic cells), Image1_2.jpg (DAPI channel), and Image1_3.jpg (stroma channel). Upload the images via the customer account.\nFor cell contact quantification choose the cell contact tool by clicking on the respective field. For cell vicinity quantification, choose the cell vicinity tool and enter the preferred vicinity radius in µm (which is measured from the cells’ edges).\nDownload the results.\n\t\tNOTE: The results are provided as .jpg files showing the hematopoietic cells and the stroma channel with the boundaries of the detected objects highlighted, as well as single .csv files containing the measurements for every image, in addition to a summary .csv file that contains the data for all uploaded images.",
    "From the contact measurements determine the frequency of hematopoietic cells (red, green, or blue cells) in contact with stromal cells, or the frequencies of red, green, or blue cells contacting the other hematopoietic cell types (an example is shown in Representative Results, Figure 4). In order to determine the frequencies, divide the given contact counts per image by the total cell counts per image.\n\t\nFor experiments with individual mice, sum up the total contact counts of all images for the single mice and divide them by the sum of total cell counts of all images.\nFrom the vicinity measurements, determine the frequency of red, green or blue cells within the selected distance from stromal cells and/or the frequencies of red, green or blue cells in the preferred proximity to the other hematopoietic cell types as described in step 4.3 (see also Representative Results, Figure 4).\n5. Simulation of Random Bone Marrow Positioning\nBefore executing the simulations of random cell positioning on the analyzed bone marrow histological images, prepare the following files in advance: the single .csv files provided by the cell contact tool, the original .jpg files for the DAPI channel and the original .jpg files for the stromal channel.\nIn order to perform batch simulations on a series of images (e.g., all images from one femoral section), collect all original .jpg files (_1, _2 and _3) and the corresponding single .csv files in one folder.\n\tNOTE: The simulation tool for random bone marrow cell positioning is available upon request.\nStart the simulation tool, check the box “Auto-load image data”.\n\tNOTE: The program will read the cell counts and average cell size from the .csv file automatically. These values are displayed in the boxes for “Cell number” and “Cell size AVG” (Figure 5A).",
    "Enter the common tag for the .csv files, i.e., the common factor in their names. Enter the number of image sets that should be used for batch-mode simulation.\nLoad the .jpg file generated from the stroma channel (with filename ending _3).\nEnter the settings for generating the mask from the DAPI channel:\n\t\nCheck the box “Apply mask?” Set the threshold for converting the DAPI image into a binary mask to 10 (range 0 - 255).\nCheck the box “8-bit?” Check the box “Dilate?” and set the grade of dilation to 5 px. Check the box “w/ erosion?”.\nEnter the desired value for the vicinity radius (neighborhood radius) used for the analysis of the simulated images. For an image of 708.15 x 708.15 µm with a size of 2,048 x 2,048 px (pixel scaling xy: 0.346 µm), 29 px correspond to 10 µm.\nCheck box “Use Otsu?” to use Otsu’s algorithm17 for automatic detection of stromal structures.\n\tNOTE: This is the same algorithm that is used by the contact and vicinity tool. Using the same image segmentation algorithm in the automated analysis of the recorded image and the simulated image is crucial in order to keep the data comparable.\nEnter the settings for hematopoietic cells, which are simulated as circular shapes.\n\tNOTE: The cell numbers for red, green, and blue cells are directly loaded from the .csv file (see also step 5.6).\n\t\nUse the simulation tool to calculate the average diameter in px of red, green and blue cells. Determine the average area of a single cell as the total area of each cell type in the image in px divided by the total cell count per image. Use the average area to calculate the radius of a disc using the formula. Double the radius to determine the average diameter.",
    "Measure the cell size distribution of the analyzed cell types with any image analysis software that includes object segmentation functions. Determine σ for all hematopoietic cell types (18 and Figure 5B).\n\tNOTE: Since the cell size distributions of the recorded cells are not determined by the automated image analysis, use a Gaussian distribution as an approximation of the real distributions. The width of the distribution curve is described by σ and can be quite different for various cell types. (For details, see Figure 5B).\n\t\nFrom these measurements, determine the “cell size cutoff”: the diameter in px that describes the smallest object still recognized as a complete cell by the image analysis tool.\nEnter parameters in the respective boxes on the graphical user interface (Figure 5A).\n\t\nEnter the cell size cut off, i.e., the minimum cell size allowed in the simulation, as a diameter in px.\nEnter σ in px for the simulation of the cell size distribution for red, green, and blue cells (from step 5.9).\nCheck the “Delete” box in the subsection “Cells in Mask”. With this setting, the program will chose a new position for a cell if it overlaps with at least one pixel with a no-go area of the mask. Check the box “Avoid cell overlap?” in the subsection “Cell exclusion”.\nEnter the allowed minimum distance between the centers of two cells in px.\n\t\tNOTE: The minimum distance needs to be determined from the recorded images. Wrongly measured minimum distances will lead to biased/artificial results for the comparison of recorded and simulated images.\nSet the maximum area of overlap to 100% if the overlap is defined by the minimum distance from center to center.\nSet the simulation tool to 1,000 repetitions.",
    "Check the box “Autosave cells?” to save the coordinates of the simulated objects for all repetitions of each image of the batch as .rect files (text format). Check the box “Autosave images?” to save a .tiff file for each simulated image. Enter a common tag for the saved files.\n\t\tNOTE: The “Autosave cells?” option reduces simulation running time and overall data size, compared to when saving the actual simulated images. The .rect files save the coordinates of the simulated cells as rectangles and can thus be converted into simulated images if needed.\nStart the simulation by clicking on “Run simulation”.\n\tNOTE: The simulation tool automatically generates a .csv file for the 1,000 simulations of every image, including the average contact counts and vicinity counts for red, green and blue cells with red, green, blue, and stromal cells for every set of repeated simulations. Additionally, for all these values, averages of the 1,000 simulations with standard deviation (STD) and standard error of mean (SEM) are provided.\nDetermine the average contact frequencies and vicinity frequencies of one set of 1,000 simulated images. For this, divide the average contact and vicinity counts by the recorded cell count per image. Compare the frequencies to the results of the automated co-localization analysis of the recorded image.\nApply appropriate statistical methods depending on the analysis19 (for Figure 7, we used a two-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test).\nSubscription Required.
