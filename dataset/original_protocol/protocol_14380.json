  "procedures": [
    "Female adult Fischer rats (180 - 200 g body weight) are housed according to NIH and USDA guidelines. The institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Miami approved all animal procedures.\n1. Pre-Transplantation Preparation\nConduit preparation.\nCut the conduit to 5 mm in length using a #10 blade under a dissecting microscope.\n\t\tNOTE: The inner diameter of the conduit is between 2.4-2.7 mm; the outer diameter is between 2.5-2.8 mm.\nFold the conduit gently along the longitudinal side (Figure 1A). Cut four small incisions about 0.4 mm long and at least 1 mm from the openings of the conduit and about 1 mm apart using straight edge Vannas scissors (Figure 1B).\n\t\t\nUnfold the conduit (Figure 1C) and cut between two incisions along the same side creating two windows side by side (Figure 1D). Ensure that the windows can be opened and closed properly along the uncut side.\nSterilize the conduits in 75% ethanol for 25 min in a 10-cm Petri dish. Rinse the conduits once for 4 min with 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and transfer the conduits with sterile forceps to a new 10-cm Petri dish. Rinse the conduits twice with 1x PBS for 25 min each.\nStore the conduits in 1x PBS until surgery.\n\t\tNOTE: Many conduits can be sterilized at once. Store the conduits in separate sterile 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes to keep them sterile.\nGreen fluorescent protein (GFP)-Schwann cell (SC) preparation\nPrepare purified SC cultures from the tibial nerves of adult female Fischer rats as previously described43. At the completion of this step, plate the SCs on poly-L-lysine (PLL)-coated 10-cm Petri dishes and maintain in D10/3M medium; these SCs are defined as passage 0.",
    "NOTE: D10/3M medium is composed of the following: 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (pen/strep), 20 µg/mL pituitary extract, 2 µM forskolin, 2.5 nM heregulin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM).\nReplenish with fresh D10/3M medium (7 mL/10-cm Petri dish) every 3 to 4 days.\nSplit SC culture once it reaches 70-80% confluence.\n\t\t\nRemove medium and rinse twice with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) without calcium or magnesium.\nAdd 5 mL of 0.25% trypsin/EDTA to each 10-cm Petri dish and incubate for 5 min at room temperature (RT).\nAdd 5 mL of D10 medium (10% FBS and 1% pen/strep in DMEM) into a 50-mL centrifuge tube to neutralize trypsin.\nGently pipet the trypsin/EDTA solution into the Petri dish several times to detach SCs. Remove the cell suspension from the dish and place it into the centrifuge tube prepared in the previous step. Rinse the dish with 5 mL of D10 medium and place it into the centrifuge tube to maximize cell harvest.\nCentrifuge the cells at 370 x g for 5 min at 4 oC. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 4 mL D10/3M medium for each Petri dish split.\nDispense 1 mL of SC suspension and 6 mL of D10/3M medium into a 10-cm Petri dish; each Petri dish split will result in 4 Petri dishes. These SCs are defined as passage 1.\nReplenish with fresh D10/3M medium the day after plating and every 3-4 days after plating.\nOnce the SCs reach 70-80% confluence, repeat steps 1.2.3.1 to 1.2.3.6. The SCs are now at passage 2.\nTransduce the SCs once reaching 50% confluence, with a lentiviral vector encoding GFP in D10/3M medium overnight at a multiplicity of infection of 30 as previously described 44,45.",
    "Replenish with fresh D10/3M medium the next day and every 3-4 days after plating.\nOnce the GFP-SCs reach 70-80% confluence, repeat steps 1.2.3.1 to 1.2.3.5 but resuspend the GFP-SCs in 6 mL of D10 medium instead. Dispense 15 µL of GFP-SC suspension into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and add 15 µL of 0.4% trypan blue solution. Flick the centrifuge tube gently and dispense 10 µL of the mixture into a chamber of the cell-counting slide.\n\t\t\nPlace the slide into an automated cell counter and determine the cell density.\nCentrifuge the cells at 370 x g for 5 min at 4 oC. Remove the supernatant, resuspend with 1.5 mL of freezing medium for every 3x106 GFP-SCs. Dispense 1.5 mL of GFP-SC suspension into a cryogenic vial, and freeze at -80oC for at least 24 h before moving to liquid nitrogen for storage.\n\t\tNOTE: Freezing medium: 25% FBS and 8% dimethyl sulfoxide in DMEM.\nThaw GFP-SCs one week before surgery.\n\t\t\nAdd 10 mL D10 medium into a 50 mL centrifuge tube.\nThaw vials of frozen GFP-SCs in water bath at 37 oC until partially thawed.\nRemove the GFP-SC suspension from the cryogenic vial and place it into the 50 mL centrifuge tube prepared in 1.2.8.1. Gently pipet the solution up and down repeatedly.\nCentrifuge the cells at 370 x g for 5 min at 4 oC. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 4 mL D10/3M medium for each vial thawed.\nDispense 2 mL of GFP-SC suspension and 5 mL of D10/3M medium into a 10-cm Petri dish; each vial should result in 2 Petri dishes. The GFP-SCs are defined as passage 3.\n\t\t\tNOTE: A 10-cm Petri dish usually yields around 8x106 GFP-SCs after one week.",
    "On the day of the surgery, repeat step 1.2.6. Use the cell density calculated in step 1.2.10.\nDispense aliquots of 3x106 GFP-SCs into sterile 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes based on the cell density calculated from step 1.2.9. Centrifuge the GFP-SC aliquots at 370 x g for 5 min at 4 oC and remove the supernatant. Add 1 mL of DMEM/F12 medium to each aliquot and centrifuge at 370 x g.\n\t\tNOTE: Each animal receives 3x106 GFP-SCs. Medium with serum is used with GFP-SCs until this step.\nKeep GFP-SCs on ice until the time of transplantation.\n2. Complete Transection at Thoracic Level 8 (T8)\nAnimal preparation for surgery\nAnesthetize a female Fischer rat (180-200 g) with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (60 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (5 mg/kg body weight). Monitor the depth of anesthesia before proceeding to the next step by checking toe pinching and eye blinking responses.\nShave the back of the rat with an electric clipper and wipe the skin with 70% ethanol. Apply ophthalmic lubricant to both eyes. Transfer the animal to the surgery table on a heating pad to maintain body temperature at about 37 oC. Place the animal on a roll so the vertebrae are easy to access.\n\t\tNOTE: The roll can be made from paper towel or 2 in x2 in gauze that can be sterilized. Larger rolls are recommended when T7-T9 needs to be laid flat on top of the roll.\nT7 to T9 laminectomy\nLocate the landmark for the T9-T11 spinous processes.\n\t\tNOTE: The gaps between T9, T10, and T11 are small compared to other segments in the region. After placing the rat on the roll, T9-T11 spinous processes will feel like a small triangular bump through the skin.",
    "Make a 4 to 5 cm midline incision of the skin using a #10 blade from T4 to T11. Make a small incision in the superficial fat layer with curved scissors with blunt ends to dissect the fat.\n\t\tNOTE: Other types of instruments can be used to separate the fat but curved scissors with blunt ends enable the most effective and least invasive method for fat separation.\nLocate the T7 to T9 spinous processes by using the back of the #10 blade. Hold the muscle at about T4 with blunt forceps and make an incision in the muscle along each side of the vertebrae from T6-T10. Make the cut as close to the vertebrae as possible to make a clean opening and cause minimal injury to the animal.\nIsolate each individual spinous process from T7 to T9 by cutting the muscles and ligaments between T6 and T7, T7 and T8, T8 and T9, and T9 and T10 with a #10 blade.\nUse a rongeur to remove any muscle and ligaments on the laminae from T7 to T9. Remove the muscles and ligaments as laterally as possible until the gaps between the transverse processes from T7 to T9 are visible.\nRemove the T9 spinous process with a rongeur. Hold the T8 spinous process with blunt forceps and lift gently to elevate the T9 lamina at the small opening between the T9 and T10 processes.\nRemove the lamina starting from the opening and moving rostrally with a rongeur at T9. Remove the lamina laterally as much as possible; the dorsal roots should be visible after the laminectomy.\nOnce the lamina is removed, repeat the process for T8 and T7.",
    "NOTE: During the laminectomy, use absorption spears to remove blood while continuing with the laminectomy. If excess bleeding occurs, place a compressed sponge at the bleeding site and add saline to help with blood clotting.\nTransection at T8\nPlace the retractor around T7 to T9. Once all the laminae are removed, make sure that the gaps between the transverse processes are visible, especially at T8. Also examine the bones along the length on both sides between T7 to T9 to ensure there are no bone fragments protruding outward.\n\t\tNOTE: This gap at T8 is important for performing the complete transection. The vertebrae along the length should be removed for easier conduit insertion.\nCut the dorsal and ventral roots above and below T8 using angled spring scissors. Add saline to the spinal cord and wait for the blood to clot. \n\t\tNOTE: This step is important for proper conduit insertion.\nPlace the angled spring scissors above the spinal cord in the gaps between the transverse processes at T8 and make one cut to completely sever the spinal cord. Place a small piece of compressed foam into the resulting 2-2.5 mm gap and add saline to the area immediately.\n3. Conduit insertion\nWhile waiting for the severed cord stumps to reach hemostasis, take out a conduit from 1x PBS. Cut the absorption triangles into thin long pieces and place them into the conduit to remove excess PBS. Check that the pre-cut windows are open.",
    "Remove saline and blood using thin long pieces of absorption triangles. Lift the two stumps of spinal cord using a microspatula to ensure good separation. Gently lift the rostral stump with the microspatula and slip the conduit over the stump with the windows facing oneself. Ensure that the entire stump is inserted and there is no excess bleeding into the conduit.\nGently lift the caudal stump and slip the other end of the conduit over the stump. Make sure that the entire stump is inserted and the windows are on the dorsal surface (Figure 2A).\n4. Schwann Cell/ Injectable Matrix (see Table of Materials) Preparation and Injection\nWhile waiting for the severed cord to reach hemostasis, remove the medium above the GFP-SC pellet (prepared in step 1.2). Resuspend the GFP-SCs in 10 µl of cold DMEM/F12. Add 10 µl of cold injectable gel to the cell suspension and mix well by repeated pipetting. Keep the GFP-SC/DMEM/F12/injectable matrix mixture on ice until conduit insertion is completed.\nAfter ensuring that the windows on the dorsal surface are open (Figure 2A), inject 20 µl of the GFP-SC/DMEM/F12/injectable matrix mixture into the conduit through one of the pre-cut windows46 using a western blot loading tip and a micropipette. If the SC/DMEM/F12/injectable matrix mixture should overfill the conduit, remove the excess with absorption triangles. Close the windows after injection; suturing is not needed (Figure 2B).\n5. Wound Closure and Postoperative Care\nSuture the muscle layers and the superficial fat layers. Clean the skin with 70% ethanol and then staple (e.g., using wound clips) the skin shut. Keep the animals in a thermally regulated incubator until they regain consciousness. Transfer the animals back into the cages. Provide water with a long feeding tube and place food pellets on the bedding for easy access.",
    "Administer Buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg body weight) twice a day for 3 days subcutaneously starting immediately after surgery to reduce pain. Inject gentamycin (5 mg/kg body weight) subcutaneously once a day for 7 days immediately after surgery to prevent and reduce infection. Inject 10 mL of lactated Ringers solution subcutaneously twice a day for 7 days for hydration.\nEmpty bladders manually twice a day until bladder function returns. If bladder infection occurs, then administer 10 mL saline subcutaneously until urine becomes clear. If there is no improvement in two days, inject gentamycin (5 mg/kg body weight, once daily) subcutaneously until the urine becomes clear.\nSubscription Required.
