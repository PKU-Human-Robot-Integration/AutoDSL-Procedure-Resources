    "Induction of reno-cardiac syndrome in mice and collection of tissue samplesAllow at least 8 week old C57BL/6 strain mice to acclimatize for 7 days in animal facility with free access to food and water, in a room with 12 h light/dark cycle.On day 8 weigh mice and change cages/diets giving half mice normal chow and the other half chow containing 0.15% adenine.Continue with diets administration to mice for 20 weeks weighing them every week.At week 20: Prepare anaesthetic Ketamine:Xylazine as 2:1 ratio. Dilute 1:10 with PBS. Weigh mouse and administer at 1.5 ml/kg, intraperitoneally.After 3 min when mouse is anaesthetized (check pinch reflex i.e., pinch foot, there should be no response).Administer buprenorphine (0.03 ml/Kg), intraperitoneally. Wait 3 min.Remove blood by cardiac puncture, performed by inserting heparinized 25 gauge needle attached to 1 ml syringe into left ventricle (see video link, Stewart and Schroeder, 2020), heparinize needle by briefly drawing up and expelling heparin from a tube, heparin may be reused for multiple needles.Approximately 0.5 ml of blood should be collected. Perform laparotomy, followed by thoracotomy. Remove heart and weigh. Blood should be centrifuged at 17,000 x g/3 min for separation of plasma and stored in refrigerator.Remove left and right kidneys. Wash in cold PBS briefly, then cut longitudinally and place into formalin for fixation.After 24 h make up a solution of 70% ethanol and transfer kidneys from formalin into 70% ethanol.After 24 h rinse tissue in PBS.Send blood to a service laboratory (IDEXX, Bioresearch, Ludwigsberg, Germany), for biochemistry measurements (plasma creatinine and urea) to determine degree of renal failure.Paraffinisation of tissueDehydrate tissueIncubate in 50% ethanol for 10 min, room temperature (RTP).Then 70% ethanol for 10 min (RTP).Then 80% ethanol for 10 min (RTP).Then 95% ethanol for 10 min (RTP).Then 100% ethanol for 10 min (RTP).",
    "Repeat this step 2 more times.Then 2:1 ratio ethanol:xylene for 10 min (RTP).Then 1:1 ratio ethanol:xylene for 10 min (RTP).Then 1:2 ratio ethanol:xylene for 10 min (RTP).Then 100% xylene for 10 min (RTP). Repeat this step 2 more times.Transfer samples to a vacuum oven set at 56 °C.Then 2:1 ratio xylene:paraffin for 30 min, 56 °C.Then 1:1 ratio xylene:paraffin for 30 min, 56 °C.Then 1:2 ratio xylene:paraffin for 30 min, 56 °C.Then 100% paraffin for 2 h, 56 °C.Then 100% paraffin overnight, 56 °C.Embed longitudinally cut kidney in fresh paraffin orientated so internal side faces upwards in wax in embedding cassette.SectioningPlace embedding cassettes with samples on ice for approximately 2 h or preferably in refrigerator overnight to cool down and facilitate cutting.Cut 5 μm sections of kidney using microtome.Place into water bath set at 42 °C.Collect individual sections onto slides.Place into slide rack and leave to dry in oven at 37 °C overnight.Deparaffinize and rehydrate slidesTake slides in rack and incubate in xylene for 3 min, room temperature (RTP). Repeat this step 2 more times.Then xylene:100% ethanol 1:1 ratio for 3 min (RTP).Then 100% ethanol for 3 min (RTP). Repeat this step.Then 95% ethanol for 3 min (RTP).Then 70% ethanol for 3 min (RTP).Then 50% ethanol for 3 min (RTP).Finally rinse off excess ethanol by rinsing under cold tap water. Leave slides rinsing under tap water until ready for antigen retrieval protocol (to prevent drying out).Antigen retrievalPour enough of the sodium citrate pH 6.0 buffer in to the slide container to cover the slides and place into the pressure cooker.With the pressure cooker on the hotplate turn on to full power. Leave the pressure cooker lid resting on top (unfastened).Once the cooker is boiling, carefully transfer the slides from the tap water into it using forceps.",
    "Fasten the lid according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Allow the cooker to reach full pressure, and then time 3 min.After 3 min have elapsed, switch off the hot plate, carefully remove the cooker off the hotplate and place the pressure cooker in a sink.Activate the pressure release valve and run cold tap water over the cooker. Once de-pressurized, remove the lid and run cold tap water into the cooker for 10 min.Slides are now ready for staining.StainingAdd Triton X-100 to TBS buffer at 0.025% final concentration.Wash slides 2 x 5 mins in TBS Triton X-100 buffer on gently rotating orbital shaker.Prepare blocking buffer (TBS + 1% BSA + 10% normal serum).Block slides in blocking buffer for 2 h on shaker, RTP.Remove slides and wipe with tissue paper (around sections).Use hydrophobic barrier pen to draw around sections.Prepare primary antibody:anti SMA antibody ( ab5694  diluted 1:250 in TBS buffer/1% BSA)oranti collagen I ( ab21286  diluted 1:200 in TBS buffer/1% BSA)oranti collagen III ( ab7778  diluted 1:400 in TBS buffer/1% BSA).Prepare humidified chamber (plastic box with tray lined with wet tissue paper, under a raised platform formed of taped together Pasteur pipettes, see Figure 1 below). Place slides flat on top with sections facing up. Apply antibody onto sections on slides. Close lid.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200917/20200917003032_3220.jpgFigure 1.

Lid closed tightly.Incubate at 4 °C overnight.Wash slides 5 min in TBS/0.025% Triton X-100, gently shaking, RTP.Repeat wash.Prepare 0.3% H2O2 in TBSApply onto sections, incubate 15 min, gently shaking, RTP.Detection stepPrepare secondary antibody, Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG H&L (HRP) ( ab205718  ) 1:1,000 dilution in TBS/1% BSA.Apply onto slides and incubate for 1 h, gentle shaking, RTP.Add DAB chromagen onto slide, 10 min with gentle shaking, RTP.",
    "Rinse slides under running tap water for 5 min.Counter stain with hematoxylin. Add Vector Hematoxylin onto slide, 5 min with gentle shaking, RTP.Rinse slides under running tap water until water is colourless.Dip slides into acid rinse 10 times.Dip slides into tap water 10 times.Add Bluing solution onto slide, 1 min with gentle shaking, RTP.Dip slides into tap water 10 times.Dehydrate tissue, clear and mountIncubate slides in 95% ethanol for 10 min, room temperature (RTP).Then 100% ethanol for 10 min (RTP). Repeat this step 2 more times.Then 100% xylene for 10 min (RTP). Repeat this step 2 more times.Mount by draining slidesApply a drop of mounting medium onto section.Cover with coverslip ensuring there are no air bubbles.Imaging acquisitionImages were recorded using a Panoramic Scanning 250 microscope (3D Histech Ltd, Budapest, Hungary) at 20x magnification (Figure 2)."
