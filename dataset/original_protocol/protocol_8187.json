    "All methods described were approved by the Wadsworth Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n1. Preparation\nDon PPE, at minimum eye protection (glasses or face shield), surgical or N-95 mask, and non-latex gloves.\nPrepare work area, ideally a bio-safety cabinet (BSC), with a disposable work surface covering (e.g., kraft paper or absorbent pads) and clean necropsy instruments (Figure 1).\nPlace the specimen on the work surface and use instruments to manipulate it to assess condition of the sample including evidence of decomposition, damage to skull, potential hazards (e.g., porcupine quills, scalpel blades), and the quality of the decapitation.\n2. Ventral method\nNOTE: When the specimen is properly decapitated at the jaw-line, the foramen magnum and the occipital condyle will be exposed. The ventral method is less complicated for retrieving the cerebellum and brain stem.\nPosition the specimen with ventral side up and nose directing distally toward the back of BSC.\nHold an orthopedic hammer/mallet in right hand (if right-handed) and at same time hold a councilmen chisel in left hand.\nPosition the chisel at a 45° angle with the corner point of the chisel directing between the right side of temporal bone and occipital bone making a “V” opening.\nStrike the top of the chisel with the hammer until the two bones separate. Make the cut to adjacent to the basisphenoid bone.\nRepeat on the left side of temporal bone/occipital bone (Figure 2A).\nBend the “V” area of skull downward with the chisel. Expose the entire rhombencephalon area of the brain (cerebellum and brain stem) (Figure 2B).\nScoop out the brain stem and cerebellum with scissors and forceps. Remove any remaining pieces from the skull if the brain stem and cerebellum did not come out in a single piece.\n3. Dorsal method",
    "NOTE: If the specimen has a poor decapitation (foramen magnum not visible) and the neck cannot be easily removed during necropsy or if damage to the cerebellum is suspected, the dorsal method should be utilized.\nPosition the specimen dorsally with the nose directing distally toward the back of BSC.\nUsing tumor tenacula, grasp the left temporal muscle with teeth of tenacula and lock by squeezing the handle.\nCut the temporal muscle down to bone with sharp carving knife.\nRotate the specimen 180° with tenacula and knife (not hand) and repeat the process on the opposite temporal muscle. Expose the skull.\nPosition a chisel at a 45° angle with the corner point of the chisel on the center of the skull at the juncture of the parietal and intraparietal bone.\nStrike the top of the chisel with a hammer until a horizontal opening is made on the top half of the skull at parietal bone.\nRotate the specimen 180° and repeat the process on the opposite side.\nInsert the point of the chisel into the end of cut 1 (Figure 3A) and at 90° of horizontal opening. Strike with the hammer until the opening reaches occipital bone (approximately 10 cm depending upon size of the specimen).\nRoll the specimen and repeat on the opposite side at the end of cut 2.\n\tNOTE: With specimen dorsal and nose positioned toward the back of BSC, the openings in the skull resemble an upside-down “U”.\nInsert the teeth of the tenacula into the skull at the bottom of the “U” and pry towards oneself. Expose the caudal end of the cerebrum and the cerebellum (Figure 3B).\nUse scissors as a scoop and pry out entire cerebellum from within the cavity.\nUse tissue forceps to tease out the brain stem from the foramen.",
    "4. Large animal method\nPosition the specimen so that the dorsal part of the skull is in contact with the necropsy surface with the caudal portion of the skull and foramen magnum facing the technician.\nInsert the modified stiletto knife into the foramen magnum in between the spinal cord and spinal meninges as far as possible.\nScore around the spinal cord to separate the cerebellum and brain stem from the spinal meninges. After the knife is inserted through the foramen magnum, gently angle the knife to follow along the skull as much as possible.\nInsert a chemistry spatula or thin, long handled spoon into the space between the neural tissue and spinal meninges.\nProbe around the spinal cord and cerebellum to ensure the connection to the spinal meninges have been severed.\nHold the brain stem with forceps. With the other hand, advance the spoon rostrally then dorsally to scoop up the cerebellum. Simultaneously pull back on the brain stem with the forceps and scoop out the cerebellum using the spoon.\n\tNOTE: It may take more than one attempt to recover adequate cerebellum for rabies testing.\n5. Post necropsy\nDispose of all disposable materials (gloves, pads, work area coverings) and unused tissues in biohazardous waste.\nClean and disinfect all instruments with method available (e.g., industrial dishwasher, autoclave, chemical disinfectant, boiling).\nClean and disinfect all work surfaces with 20% bleach and/or 70% ethanol.\nSubscription Required.
