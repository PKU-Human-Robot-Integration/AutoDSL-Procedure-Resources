    "This protocol is in accordance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines and was approved by the Dalhousie University Committee on Laboratory Animals.\n1. Construct Reflective Markers:\nUsing a hand-held hole punch, punch the desired number of small circles from a sheet of reflective paper. Each animal requires 5 markers for a single recording; two large and three small markers.\nUsing fine scissors, make a straight cut extending from the perimeter to the center of the circle.\nRemove the paper backing of the marker to reveal the adhesive surface. Using fine forceps, grip the marker firmly and curl it in on itself using your finger to form a cone shape. To make a small marker, curl the cone tightly. To make a large marker, curl the cone loosely.\nUsing a hand-held glue gun, fill the inside of the cone-shaped marker with glue while gripping the tip of the cone with forceps and adhere the marker to a flat piece of cardboard. The glue will prevent the marker from collapsing and bending during recording to ensure optimal reflection of light. When the glue is dry (approximately 10 min), remove the marker from the cardboard with a scalpel (Figure 1A).\n2. Prepare the Animal for Recording\nAnesthetize the mouse with isoflurane gas (2.5%; 2 liters/min O2) by placing the mouse into an induction chamber. Once the mouse is unconscious, place it into a nose cone positioned on top of a recirculating water heating blanket. The purpose of anesthetization is to immobilize the mouse for marker placement; the procedure is not painful. Therefore, depth of anesthesia does not need to be assessed.\nApply a topical eye lubricant to both eyes.",
    "Shave the desired hindlimb using electric clippers. Begin at the ankle and extend to the spine and bottom of the ribs; ensure no fur is left as this will impair marker adhesion.\n\tNote: Here, the right hindlimb was recorded; however, either hindlimb can be used.\nUsing a permanent marker, indicate the location of the iliac crest and the hip joint. The iliac crest is just below the bottom of the ribs and is easily palpable by bringing the knees together under the mouse's body.\n\tNote: The hip joint can be found by flexing and extending the leg to find the articulation point between the pelvis and femur.\nUsing fine forceps, grasp the pointed end of a small marker and dip the base in fast-acting adhesive glue, or an equivalent alternative. Place the marker on the tip of the fourth digit and hold in place for 2-3 s to allow the glue to dry. Place the other two small markers on the metatarsophalangeal joint and ankle in the same manner (Figure 1B).\nPlace large markers on the iliac crest and hip joint (Figure 1B) in the same manner as the small markers.\nRemove the mouse from the nose cone and immediately transfer to the recording room using a transfer cage. Place the mouse on the stationary treadmill and allow for full recovery from anesthesia.\n3. Gait Recording\nPrior to recording the mouse's gait, take a picture of a calibration block with known dimensions on the treadmill.\n\tNote: This will allow the pixels in the video to be converted to real measurements. The camera should be placed approximately 120 cm from the treadmill.\n\t\nPosition the camera at the same height and level as the treadmill. Maintain the same camera position for the recordings following the calibration image.",
    "Once the mouse has fully recovered from anesthesia, turn the treadmill to a low speed (5 cm/s) to let the mouse begin walking. Ensure that the treadmill belt direction is such that the markers on the mouse are facing towards the camera.\nIncrease the treadmill speed gradually up to 20 cm/s; this is the ideal speed for a consistent gait in most healthy mice.\n\tNote: Although it is ideal to have all mice walking at the same speed, some may be unable to consistently reach this speed.\n\t\nIf the mouse is unable to walk at 20 cm/s, reduce the speed as necessary and be sure to make a note of this. Reduce the speed of the treadmill until consistent step cycles are achieved.\n\t\tNote: Later data analysis can adjust for differences in speeds.\nBegin recording the video once the mouse is walking steadily (i.e., walking at a consistent pace, not rearing or weaving side to side). Continue recording until 8 to 12 consecutive step cycles have been recorded. For every video, record the speed of the treadmill and the side of the mouse recorded.\nOnce recording is complete, turn off the treadmill and return the mouse to its cage. Clean the treadmill thoroughly between recordings as scents left behind by other mice may alter the behavior of incoming mice. To reduce stress and skin damage, do not remove the markers; allow the mice to remove them on their own.\n4. Analysis\nProcess the videos using motion analysis software.\n\tNote: In our experiments, we used custom scripts designed for imaging and statistical software (see Table of Materials) that were written by Dr. Nicolas Stifani. The following steps are performed using the selected motion analysis software.",
    "Extract the pixel coordinates of the markers from the videos, and using the calibration video, transform the pixel values to centimeters and calculate the joint angles at each frame.\nIdentify the beginning and end of each step cycle, thereby obtaining information about step duration and length.\nNormalize the step cycle duration to 200 normalized frames, such that swing and stance are represented by 100 frames, respectively.\nUsing the normalized frames, calculate kinematic parameters for data analysis using spreadsheet software (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nTo establish the average angle of a particular joint, take the mean of all angles within a normalized frame as:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56032/56032eq1v4.jpg\n\t\tNote: Here x represents the angle value at a given normalized frame, and n represents the normalized frame number.\nTo establish the range of motion of a particular joint for a given mouse, subtract the smallest angle from the largest angle in a set of normalized frames as follows:\nRange of motion = Anglemaximum - Angleminimum.\n\t\tNote: Here Anglemaximum and Angleminimum are the greatest and smallest angles achieved within the normalized step cycle, respectively.\nTo establish RMS difference, first subtract the average angle of each experimental time-point from the baseline recording. Next, square each difference, take the mean of all squared values and square root the mean. The equation is as follows:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56032/56032eq3v4.jpg\n\t\tNote: Here imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56032/56032eq4.jpg represents the average angle from the baseline recording; y represents the average angle from each experimental time-point; n and represents the number of normalized frames. Root mean squared (RMS) difference is a measurement used to assess deviation in gait from baseline recordings.\nUse scientific graphing and statistics software to analyze and present the data (see Table of Materials).\nSubscription Required.
