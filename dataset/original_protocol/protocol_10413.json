    "NOTE: Perform the experimental protocols in the order described below. The bacterial culture protocol is discussed in Section 1 (Also see Figure 1). Section 2 describes the protocol for enriching the culture medium using external additives. Section 3 describes the protocols for multi-mode microscopy. Weights of all the individual components may be measured using an analytical balance. Volume of each solution may be measured using a volumetric cylinder.\nNOTE: Proper biosafety protocols must be followed for Sections 1 - 2. Consult the institutional safety office for details.\n1. Bacterial Culture\nCulture Bacteria - Agar Plate Medium Preparation\nAssemble equipment and ingredients such as Petri dishes, flask, Tris-base, HCl, agar, Millipore water, pH-meter etc.Sterilize all containers by autoclaving at 121 °C before use.\nPrepare 1 L of 0.13 M aqueous solution of Tris-buffer by mixing 15.75 g Tris-base with 1 L of Millipore water. To lower the pH level of the original solution (pH 10.4) add 2,800 µl of HCl (50% concentration). Check continuously using a pH-meter to set pH = 9.\nDivide the 1 L buffer solution into two parts as follows:\n\t\t\nTake 800 ml of this solution. Divide it equally into two parts of 400 ml each. Dissolve 8 g (NH4)2SO4 to one solution and 16 g yeast extract to the other solution.\nTake the remaining (200 ml of) solution and divide it again into two parts of 100 ml each. Mix 2 g (NH4)2SO4 to one. Add 4 g yeast extract and 4 g agar to the other.\nAutoclave the 4 solutions separately after wrapping the respective flasks in Al foil and sticking autoclave tapes.\n\t\tNOTE: If a benchtop autoclave unit is used, the volume should be set to 500 ml (temperature and pressure automatically specified as a function of volume).",
    "After taking them out from the autoclave, set the two 400 ml solutions aside for step 1.3.1 (below). Mix the two 100 ml solutions to have a 200 ml solution. Pour the mixture into 10 - 12 Petri dishes.\nCulture Bacteria - Agar Plate Sample Preparation\nRemove the bacterial stock from freezer (-80 °C) and allow it to thaw. After thawing properly, place the bacterial stock and the agar plate inside a biosafety hood.\nSelect the micropipette of smallest available dimension (0.5 - 10 µl is a good choice) to infest the tip with the Sporosarcina pasteurii stock. Streak an agar plate with the micropipette tip. Place the streaked agar plate inside a non-shaking incubator at 31 °C for 48 hr.\nAfter 48 hr, remove the plate from the incubator and visually examine for the existence of single colonies. If there are no single colonies, then place it in the incubator for another 24 hr.\nRepeat the process until single colonies are detected. Do not exceed 7 days of trial.\n\t\tNOTE: If single colonies do not appear even after a week, then it is concluded that the steps have not been followed properly and the entire process must be repeated from step 1.\nCulture Bacteria - Final Sample Preparation\nMix the two 400 ml solutions (Tris buffer + (NH4)2SO4 and Tris buffer + yeast extract (1.5.1) together to obtain an 800 ml solution. Transfer 125 ml of this solution into a flask.\nPerform a visual examination of the surface of the agar plate to identify regions with high concentration of single colonies. Gently nudge and break one of the colonies with a micropipette tip.",
    "Dip the same micropipette tip into the 125 ml flask and stir it thoroughly to ensure that sufficient number of cells for robust multiplication get transferred. Place the flask in a shaking incubator at 150 rpm, 30 °C for 2 - 3 days. After 2 - 3 days, remove the flask from the incubator.\nCulture Bacteria - Final Cell Count\nPerform serial dilution of the non-diluted culture solution using PBS to attain a dilution of at least ten million (10-7) to ensure countable single colonies appear. Draw seven parallel equidistant lines on one of the agar-plates.\n\t\t\nDo this by drawing bold lines on the bottom surface of the Petri dish, prominent enough to be visible from top. Drop 3 little drops of non-diluted solution into one segment. Add 1 ml of non-diluted solution to 9 ml of Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) to obtain a 1:10 dilution.\nTake a small aliquot (~ 0.1 ml) of this newly diluted solution with a pipette and drop 3 more small drops on the next segment. Transfer the newly diluted solution to a new flask and further diluted ten times (10x) by adding PBS. This brings down the dilution to 10-2 or 1:100.\n\t\t\nUse this 1:100 solution in the next segment. Repeat this he process with small volumes of the freshly diluted solutions by successively transferring them to new flasks and continuously diluting ten-fold (10x) in tandem with PBS to obtain more and more dilute samples from 10-3 or 1:1,000 all the way down to 10-7 or 1:10 million into the last segment.\nPerform Colony-Forming Unit (CFU) plate count to count the number of cells present in the agar plate after incubating the plate for 1 - 2 days at 31 °C. This gives a quantitative measure of the bacterial count in the undiluted sample.",
    "NOTE: The CFU value is measured based on the ability of the system to give rise to colonies under the specific conditions of nutrient medium, temperature and time assuming that every colony is separate and founded by a single viable microbial cell.\nSeal the Petri dishes with self-sealing film and store remaining items in a refrigerator for future use.\n2. Protocol for Enrichment of Nutrient to Accelerate Precipitation\nTransfer 9 ml of the prepared culture liquid (cells + medium) into several sterilized centrifuge tubes, each of 10 ml volume.\nPrepare a 100 ml stock solution of the external enrichment consisting of four components in the following concentrations in fresh medium: Urea: 2 g/L, Ammonium chloride: 1 g/L, Sodium bicarbonate: 212 mg/L, Calcium chloride: 280 mg/L. Carefully measure all the ingredients using an analytical balance and mix all but urea with fresh medium in a beaker and place in the autoclave (121 °C, 15 psi, 15 min).\n\t\nFollowing autoclave, mix the requisite amount of urea (2 mg) with 1 ml of fresh medium and pass through a syringe fitted with 0.22 µm syringe filter to complete the process of enrichment.\nAdd 1 ml of this enrichment medium with additives to the sterilized centrifuge tubes containing 9 ml of the prepared culture liquid (cells + medium) (see step 2.1).\n\t\tNOTE: Of all these components, urea being degradable at elevated temperatures, cannot be sterilized in an autoclave. Hence, after the other components have been autoclaved (121 °C, 15 psi, 15 min), urea is added last through a 0.22 µm syringe filter.",
    "Vortex each tube thoroughly using a mechanical vortexer. Place the enriched liquids (cells + medium + additives) in a non-shaking incubator at 30 °C. Monitor all the units regularly for initiation of precipitation. Using a light microscope, begin microscopic observations once onset of precipitation is detected with the naked eye. This is usually between 30 - 36 hr after start of experiments.\n3. Protocol for Multi-mode Microscopy\nTransfer a small volume (~ 1 ml) of fluid to a high-magnification microscopy-chambered coverglass system to perform initial observations with bright field mode. To begin with, start all observations with the lowest magnification (4X). which provides a wide area of coverage and hence global information about the distribution of precipitates.\nSelect particular areas with significant volumes of precipitations and zoom in (20X, 40X, 60X) by progressively increasing the magnification.\n\tNOTE: Since it's impossible to properly resolve the cells from the Extracellular Polymeric Substance (EPS) under bright-field (due to very close refractive indices), switch on phase-contrast mode whenever necessary. In this mode, just the outlines of the cell membranes (being a different phase than the bulk cell) are visible, thus enabling visual differentiation.\nFinally, stain some chambers with Live/ Dead stain that selectively dyes the live components as green while coloring the dead components in red. Refer to standard protocols28.\nSwitch on fluorescent mode to properly distinguish between the red and green regions. Red (Red filter cube with Excitation wavelength of 540 - 580 nm, Dichroic mirror of 595 nm and Barrier filter of 600 - 660 nm) and Green (GFP Long-pass Green filter cube with Excitation wavelength of 440 - 480 nm, Dichroic mirror of 505 nm and Barrier filter of 510 nm) filter cubes are used to facilitate fluorescent micrographs.",
    "Once all multi-mode data have been gathered, select the best images and manually overlay (individual brightfield, phase-contrast and fluorescent images) to obtain the best possible contrast and clarity.\nPerform SEM on the dried solid samples to understand crystal structures. This is a well-established and standard procedure.22 Perform XPS to identify chemical signatures of functional groups (carbonates). This is a well-established and standard procedure as well.23\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
