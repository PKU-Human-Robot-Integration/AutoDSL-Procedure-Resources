    "The schematic representation of the method workflow is shown in Figure 1.\n1. Co-transformation of E. coli\nPrepare expression vectors for target proteins using standard cloning methods.\n\tNOTE: Typically, a good starting point is to use conventional pGEX/pMAL vectors bearing an ampicillin resistance gene and ColE1 origin for the expression of GST/MBP-tagged proteins and a compatible vector with p15A or RSF origin and kanamycin resistance to express 6xHis-tagged proteins, in some cases combined with either Thioredoxin or SUMO-tag to increase solubility. Usually, several combinations of tags need to be tested prior to the experiment. The described method itself is convenient for batch testing the expression conditions of target proteins. It is important to note that most Rosetta strains already contain the plasmid with p15A origin for expressing the tRNAs for rare codon;, thus if using such strains is a possible option, the p15A plasmids should be avoided. See the Table of Materials for details.\n\t\nGrow bacteria of an appropriate strain in Luria-Bertani (LB) media at 37 °C to an optical density (OD) of 0.1-0.2. BL21(DE3) strain was used for examples in this study.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to use freshly prepared competent cells to achieve efficient co-transformation with two vectors. If more than two vectors need to be co-transformed, it is better to transform them sequentially to achieve good transformation efficiency. Electroporation is a good alternative.\nCentrifuge 1.0 mL of the bacterial suspension for 1 min at 9,000 x g at 4 °C, and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 0.5 mL of ice-cold buffer transformation buffer (TB) (10 mM MOPS [pH 6.7], 250 mM KCl, 55 mM MnCl2, and 15 mM CaCl2) and incubate for 10 min on ice.\nCentrifuge for 30 s at 8,000 x g at 4 °C, and discard the supernatant.",
    "Add 100 µL of TB buffer, add 100 ng of each vector, and incubate for 30 min on ice. Separately transform single vectors to study protein behavior without co-expression. Additionally, co-transform expression vectors in pairs with empty co-expression vectors for non-specific binding controls.\n\t\t​NOTE: In the examples provided in this study, pGEX/pMAL vectors with corresponding cDNAs fused to GST/MBP cDNAs were used in combination with compatible pACYC-derived vectors bearing cDNA encoding partner protein domains fused to Thioredoxin cDNA.\nHeat at 42 °C for 150 s, then chill for 1 min on ice.\nAdd 1 mL of liquid LB media without antibiotics and incubate at 37 °C for 90 min. Plate on LB-agar plates containing 0.5% glucose and corresponding antibiotics (common concentrations are: 50 mg/L ampicillin; 20 mg/L kanamycin; 50 mg/L streptomycin; 35 mg/L chloramphenicol). Incubate the plates overnight at 37 °C.\n2. Expression\nFlush the cells from the plate with 2 mL of liquid LB media into 50 mL of LB media with corresponding antibiotics (common concentrations are: 50mg/L ampicillin; 20 mg/L kanamycin; 50 mg/L streptomycin; 35 mg/L chloramphenicol). Add metal ions or other known co-factors (in the examples provided in this study, 0.2 mM ZnCl2 was added to the media). Store an aliquot with 20% glycerol at -70 °C for a subsequent repeat of the experiment.\n\tNOTE: It is recommended to flush several colonies directly from the plate to exclude the possibility of bad expression in a single isolated clone due to occasional recombination events between two plasmids.\nGrow the cells with a constant rotation of 220 rpm at 37 °C to an OD of 0.5-0.7, cool to room temperature (RT), and add isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to 1 mM. Store a 20 µL aliquot of cell suspension as a control of the un-induced sample.",
    "Incubate the cells with a constant rotation of 220 rpm at 18 °C overnight.\n\tNOTE: The optimal time and temperature of incubation may vary; 18 °C overnight works best for most proteins and is advised to be tried by default. Reduce the incubation time to 2-3 h if a strong non-specific binding is observed.\nDivide the bacterial suspension into two parts (or more if more than two different tags were used) and store a 20 µL aliquot of the cell suspension to confirm protein expression. Centrifuge at 4,000 x g for 15 min.\n\tNOTE: Pause point: bacterial pellets can be stored at -70 °C for at least 6 months.\n3. Pulldown assay\nNOTE: The detailed procedures are described for proteins tagged with either 6xHis or MBP/GST. All procedures are performed at 4°C.\nResuspend the bacterial pellets in 1 mL of ice-cold lysis buffer with protease inhibitors and reducing agents (see below) added immediately prior to the experiment. Avoid dithiotreitol (DTT) when using metal-chelating resins since it strips out metal ions. Adjust the buffer composition for the tested proteins. The common recipes of lysis buffers found suitable for most proteins are:\n\t\n6xHis-pulldown: Mix 30 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 400 mM NaCl, 10 mM Imidazole, 0.1% NP40, 10% [w/w] glycerol, 5 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM phenylmethylsfulfonylfluoride (PMSF), and a 1:1,000 dilution of the protease inhibitor cocktail (see Table of Materials).\nGST- or MBP-pulldown: Mix 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5 at 25 °C), 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM ZnCl2, 0.1% NP40, 10% [w/w] glycerol, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, and a 1:1,000 dilution of the protease inhibitor cocktail (see Table of Materials).\nDisrupt the cells by sonication on ice. Store a 20 µl aliquot for electrophoresis.",
    "NOTE: Typically, 20-25 pulses of 5 s with 15 s intervals with 20 W output power are required per sample. The appropriate sonication power should be adjusted for each instrument to avoid overheating and ensure total cell disruption. To achieve better performance, it is strongly recommended to use high-throughput multi-tip sonicator probes.\nCentrifuge at 20,000 x g for 30 min. Collect 20 µL of the clarified lysate for subsequent SDS-PAGE analysis.\nEquilibrate the resin (50 µL for each sample) with 1 mL of ice-cold lysis buffer for 10 min, centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 30 s, and discard the supernatant.\nAdd cell lysates (total protein concentration: 20-50 mg/mL) to the resin, incubate for 10 min at a constant rotation of 15 rpm, centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 30 s, and discard the supernatant. Collect 20 µL of the unbound fraction for subsequent SDS-PAGE analysis.\nAdd 1 mL of ice-cold wash buffer and incubate for 1 min. Centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 30 s, and discard the supernatant. The common recipes for wash buffers are:\n\t\n6xHis-pulldown: Mix 30 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 400 mM NaCl, 30 mM Imidazole, 0.1% NP40, 10% [w/w] glycerol, and 5 mM beta-mercaptoethanol.\nGST- or MBP-pulldown: Mix 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5 at 25 °C), 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM ZnCl2, 0.1% NP40, 10% [w/w] glycerol, and 5 mM DTT.\nPerform two long washes: add 1 mL of ice-cold wash buffer, incubate for 10-30 min with a constant rotation of 15 rpm, centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 30 s, and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 1 mL of ice-cold wash buffer, incubate for 1 min, centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 30 s, and discard the supernatant.",
    "Elute the bound proteins with 50 μL of the elution buffer in a shaker at 1,200 rpm for 10 min. The common recipes of elution buffers are:\n\t\n6xHis-pulldown: Mix 30 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 400 mM NaCl, 300 mM Imidazole, and 5 mM beta-mercaptoethanol.\nGST-pulldown: 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5 at 25 °C), 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Glutathione (adjusted to pH 7.5 with basic Tris), and 5 mM DTT.\nMBP-pulldown: Mix 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5 at 25 °C), 150 mM NaCl, 40 mM maltose, and 5 mM DTT.\nAnalyze the eluted proteins with SDS-PAGE.\n\tNOTE: The percentage of acrylamide should be adjusted to the size of the proteins. In the examples provided in this study, 12% acrylamide gels were used, running in tris-glycine-SDS buffer (2 mM Tris, 250 mM Glycine, 0.1% SDS) at constant voltage of 180 V. Gels were stained by boiling in 0.2% Coomassie blue R250, 10% acetic acid, and 30% isopropanol, and de-stained by boiling in 10% acetic acid. The amount of loaded protein should not be equal, since various amounts of interacting proteins can be pulled down in different experiments.\nSubscription Required.
