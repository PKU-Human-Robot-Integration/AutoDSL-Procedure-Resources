    "All animal procedures were performed in accordance with institutional regulations and the Guide to the Care and Use of Experimental Animals from the Canadian Council for Animal Care and has been approved by local authorities (“the Bannatyne Campus Animal Care Committee”). All efforts were made to minimize the number and suffering of animals used. Adequate depth of anesthesia was confirmed by observing that there was no change in respiratory rate associated with manipulation and toe pinch or corneal reflex.\n1. Preparation\nNOTE: Schedule the provision of timed pregnant mice, based on the research plan, for post-conception E12–E18. Choice of the timing depends on the desired cell characteristics (see below). Prepare the cover slips and plates at least 2 days before the experiment. Poly-L-ornithine is used as a coating material to enhance cell attachment to the cover slips.\nCoat the cover slips 2 days before cell isolation.\nPlace the round cover slips in a 24 well plate, under sterile conditions in a biosafety cabinet. Leave a gap between each cover slip to avoid any contamination.\nAdd 90 µL of poly-L-ornithine (PLO, 500 µg/mL) to the center of each cover slip. Close the cap and gently place the plate in a 37 °C/5% CO2 incubator for 2 days.NOTE: A greater volume may spill off the cover slips during incubation. The cover slip does not need to be completely covered with PLO after placing a drop. During overnight incubation, PLO distributes equally to the edge of the cover slips.",
    "One day before cell isolation, prepare the culture medium I (DMEM/F-12 containing putrescine 100 µM, sodium selenite 30 nM, L-glutamine 3.9 mM, gentamicin 3.5 µg/mL, tri-iodothyronine (T3) 0.5 ng/mL, and N3 supplements [progesterone 4 µM, insulin 20 μg/mL, transferrin 20 mg/mL]) and seeding medium (culture medium I [without N3 and T3] containing 10% fetal bovine serum [FBS]) and store them in 4 °C. Prepare the trypsin working solution (0.25%) in DMEM/F12 and keep it at 4 °C.NOTE: The medium compositions are provided in Table 1.\nOn the day of cell isolation, place culture medium I and seeding medium in the incubator at 37 °C.NOTE: Before starting the cerebellum isolation, make sure that all the tools and working surfaces are sterile.\nWash cover slips.\nTake the 24 well plate out of the incubator.\nWash the cover slips in the 24 well plate 3x with double distilled water (DDW) in a biosafety cabinet under sterile conditions. Each time let the cover slips soak in DDW for 5 min before starting aspiration.\nLeave the cover slips in a biosafety cabinet for at least 2 h to completely dry.\n2. Cerebellum collection\nPrepare three 10 cm sterile plastic Petri dishes filled with ice-cold 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 3 Petri dishes filled with ice-cold 1x Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS), and approximately 5 Petri dishes filled with ice-cold dissection medium (1x HBSS containing gentamicin 10 μg/mL). Keep them on ice.\nAnesthetize the E18 CD1 pregnant mouse with 40% isoflurane. Perform cervical dislocation on the mouse. Sterilize the abdomen with 70% ethanol solution.\nUse a pair of scissors to make a skin incision from the pubic symphysis to the xiphoid process. Then hold the skin with forceps and open the abdominal cavity.",
    "Excise the uterine horns with forceps and wash them 3x in the ice-cold 1x PBS on ice.NOTE: The following steps should all be conducted on ice to minimize the metabolic rate and prevent tissue and cell damage.\n3. Dissecting the cerebellum\nAfter the last washing step, using a pair of fine forceps separate the embryos from the uterus in 1x HBSS and transfer them to the ice-cold dissection medium. In the dissection medium, decapitate the embryos with scissors. Place the tissue in a clean dissection medium.NOTE: Using a stereomicroscope for microdissection is optional.\nHold the skull with fine forceps and cut through the calvarium with a pair of small scissors from the lateral aspect of the skull in a line from the foramen magnum to the external acoustic meatus and inferior border of the orbital cavity.NOTE: Taking this step exposes the cranial cavity at the level of the skull base and makes it easier to remove the brain.\nUsing a pair of fine forceps, remove the skull base and peel the skull away from the brain.\nCarefully remove the meninges on the cerebellum, starting from the lateral surface of the middle cerebellar peduncle and pons.\nCut both cerebellar peduncles and separate the cerebellum from the rest of the brain (Figure 1).\nImmediately place the collected cerebella in a sterile 15 mL conical tube filled with 14 mL of DMEM/F12 on ice.\nCentrifuge the tube at 1,000 x g, 4 °C for 1 min, 3x. Each time gently remove the supernatant with a pipette and resuspend the pellet in fresh, ice-cold DMEM/F12.NOTE: To avoid losing the samples, use the cabinet suction as little as possible.\n4. Cerebellum dissociation\nAdd 2 mL of prewarmed (37 °C) trypsin to the pellet from step 3.7 and gently pipet for adequate mixing.",
    "Place the tube in a 37 °C water bath for 12 min.\nAfter incubation, bring the tube to a biosafety cabinet and add 10 mL of DMEM/F12 to inactivate the trypsin.\nCentrifuge the mixture at 1,200 x g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in fresh DMEM/F12. Repeat 3x.\nPrewet a sterile plastic transfer pipet with DMEM/F12.\nAfter washing and the final centrifugation, add 3.5 mL of DNase working solution (1 mL of DNase I stock solution [0.05% DNase + 12 mM MgSO4 + 1x HBSS] in 500 µL of heat-inactivated FBS and 2 mL of DMEM/F12) to the pellet in the same tube.\nTriturate the tissue with a pipet at least 30x until the mixture attains a homogenous milky color.\n5. Cell collection\nAdd 10 mL of ice-cold DMEM/F12 to the mixture.\nCentrifuge the sample at 1,200 x g, 4 °C for 5 min.\nCarefully remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.\nRemove the seeding medium from the incubator.\nAdd 500 µL of prewarmed seeding medium to the pellet and mix it very well using a pipet to resuspend the cells.\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer.\nDilute the cell suspension with the seeding medium to a density of 5 x 105 cells/mL.\nUnder a biosafety cabinet, add 90 µL of the diluted mixture to each well at the center of the cover slip.NOTE: Do not load the particles that did not suspend in the DNase.\nPlace the plate in the incubator at 37 °C for 3−4 h.\nAfter incubation, add 500 µL of prewarmed culture medium I to each well and place the plate back into the incubator (37 °C).\n6. Treatment of the recovered cells",
    "After 7 days, replace the old medium with fresh culture medium II (culture medium I supplemented with cytosine arabinoside [Ara-C, 4 μM] and 100 μg/mL bovine serum albumin [BSA]; see Table 1).NOTE: This step is critical to avoid growth of nonneuronal cells.\nMonitor the culture medium once a day. If the pH changes (indicated by a marked change in color, usually yellower), remove half (almost 250 µL) of the old medium from all wells and add 300 µL of prewarmed culture medium I to each of them to avoid nutrient loss.NOTE: Phenol red in culture medium is a good indicator of the pH of the medium and activity of the cells. Try to minimize the exposure time of the cells to out of incubator conditions. This prevents any stress that might affect their viability.\n7. Cell collection and fixation\nNOTE: Depending on the experimental design, the cells can be collected at any day, at any timepoint.\nPrepare a separate 24 well plate with the corresponding numeric organization and add 100 µL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) to each well.\nTo harvest cells on the desired days (depending on the experimental protocol), gently remove the cover slips from the wells of the original culture plate and place them in the corresponding wells of the PFA-filled plate.\nAdd PFA to the wells to completely immerse the cover slips.NOTE: To avoid cell detachment from the cover slip, do not add the PFA directly on the cover slip.\nKeep the PFA plate at 4 °C for 30−120 min.\nAfter incubation, restore the plate to room temperature.\nGently wash the cover slips 3x for 5 min with 1x PBS.",
    "Proceed to the immunostaining process.NOTE: In this study, a fluorescence microscope equipped with a camera was used to capture the images and assembled into montages using an image editing software application.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
