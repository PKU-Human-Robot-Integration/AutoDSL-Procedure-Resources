    "The work adheres to the Declaration of Helsinski and the ARVO Animal Statement. Animals were used for tissue collection and all relevant methods were followed according to the instructions of the animal facility at the University of Dresden. Animals were handled and housed according to the German Federal guidelines for the use and care of laboratory animals, and the study was approved by the Landesdirektion Dresden. Please consult with your institution’s veterinary policy (IACUC or other board) regarding appropriate euthanasia methodology.\nSpecific stock and working concentrations of reagents can be found in the Reagent Tables accompanying this protocol.\n1. Culture Dish Preparation\nCoat dishes with a sufficient volume of 75 μg/ml poly-L-ornithine (i.e. 2 ml/well of a 6-well plate) overnight in the cell culture incubator 2 days prior to the scheduled dissection date.\nAspirate the poly-L-ornithine the following day and wash each well 2x with 3 ml of PBS for 5 min.\nRemove the final wash, then add fibronectin (diluted 1:250, 4 μg/ml in PBS) to the plate and place the dishes in the incubator overnight.\nAspirate the fibronectin on the day of dissection and wash the dishes 2x with PBS. Return the plates still containing the final PBS wash to the incubator until the dissociated tissue is ready for culturing. At that time, remove the PBS prior to plating the tissue.\nStore plates coated with poly-L-ornithinein the incubator for up to 3 weeks. Plates coated with fibronectin can be stored for up to 1 week. Fibronectin coating can be done in as little as 2 hr if urgent. Fibronectin is susceptible to denaturation; do not agitate the solution or let dishes dry.\n2. Dissection/Plating\nThis protocol applies to the use of 3 adult rats (3-6 months of age).",
    "Chill the brain sectioning block on ice prior to euthanizing the rat.\nPlace a 15 ml Falcon tube that contains 5 ml of N2 medium with added bFGF on ice.\nEuthanize the rats according to your institution’s veterinary policy.\nRemove the brain from the skull by making an incision down the midline of the head. Use forceps to peel away the bone allowing for the brain to be carefully extracted.\nPlace the brain into a 10 cm Petri dish containing ice cold PBS. This will remove any residual hair and blood. (Figure 1A)\nPlace the brain into the chilled sectioning block. (Figure 1B)\nInsert one new clean razor blade into the block as pictured in Figure 1C.\nInsert a second clean razor blade 3 mm caudal to the first as illustrated in Figure 1D.\nCarefully lift the blades from the block, taking with them the section of interest.\nFloat the section off the blade by immersing it in PBS. (Figure 1E)\nHarvest tissue from the area of interest (in this example we used the anterior commissure, (anterior) ACA, Figure 1F) using #5 forceps and collect into a 15 ml conical tube containing 1 ml N2 medium containing bFGF.\nMove the tube into a laminar flow cell culture hood, continuing the remainder of the protocol under sterile conditions.\nMechanically dissociate the tissue using a 1 ml pipette tip attached to a P1000 pipettor. Pipette up and down several times (approximately 20x at a rate of 1 pipetting cycle per second) while pressing the opening of the pipette tip against the bottom of the conical tube (Figures 1G 1-3). Stop trituration when the solution becomes homogeneous.\nAllow the solution to sit for 2 min to allow any larger nondissociated tissue to settle to the bottom. (Figure 1G 4)",
    "Collect the homogeneous supernatant and place into a conical tube containing 8.5 ml of N2 media plus 20 ng/ml bFGF, 500 ng/ml Dll4, 500 ng/ml Ang2, and 200 nMJAK Inhibitor.\nPlate them into 3 wells of a 6-well plate using 3 ml of diluted cell solution/well.\nPlace the plate into a humidified cell incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 5% O2.\n3. Daily Care\nReplace the medium on the culture dishes with N2 Medium containing bFGF, Ang2, Dll4, and JAK inhibitor 24 hr after plating.\nAdd a bolus of bFGF, Dll4, Ang2, and JAK inhibitor on the next day.\nContinue this alternating process of media changes and factor additions for a total of 10-14 days.\n4. Induction of Differentiation\nWithdraw bFGF, Dll4, Ang2, and JAK inhibitor containing medium and replace it with N2 medium that does not contain any additional factors.\nChange the medium every second day.\nFix the cells after 10 days and perform immunocytochemistry.\n5. Immunocytochemical Detection\nAspirate the medium and fix cell culture plates with 2 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min.\nWash 2x with 3 ml of PBS for 5 min each.\nAspirate PBS, then permeabilize and block the cells by adding 2 ml of PBS containing 5% normal donkey serum (NDS) and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min.\nPrepare the primary antibody mix in PBS containing 5% NDS. Anti-nestin antibody can be used for identifying SCs, while TuJ1 (class III β-tubulin), GFAP, and CNPase antibodies can be used together for a triple staining of differentiation markers.\nAspirate the blocking solution and add 1.5 ml of the primary antibody mixture to each well. Incubate at room temperature for 90 min.",
    "Remove the primary antibodies and wash 2x with 3 ml of PBS, and 1x with 3 ml of PBS containing 5% NDS for 5 min each.\nPrepare the secondary antibodies in PBS containing 5% NDS.\nAspirate the final wash and add 1.5 ml of secondary antibody solution to each well. Incubate in the dark for 40 min at room temperature.\nRemove the secondary antibody solution and add 2 ml of a freshly prepared DAPI stain (500 ng/ml in PBS). Incubate for 3 min.\nAspirate the DAPI solution then wash 3x with 3 ml of PBS for 5 min each. The cells can now be visualized with a fluorescence microscope.\nSubscription Required.
