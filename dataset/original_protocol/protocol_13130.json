    "NOTE: The protocol described here requires (i) a high-pressure pump and cell with a 2.5 kbar rated aluminum-toughened zirconia tube18, (ii) the software SPARKY19 for analysis of the NMR spectra, and (iii) a curve fitting software.\n1. Sample preparation, assembly of the high-pressure cell, and setting up the experiments.\nChoice of buffer: Use equal mixture of anionic and cationic buffers, such as phosphate and Tris20,21.\n\tNOTE: The pKa of anionic buffers such as phosphate and MES is associated with a substantial reaction volume (i.e., the difference in the partial molal volumes of the acid and the ionized products). The pH of such buffers can therefore be significantly affected by a change of pressure (~0.25-0.5 pH unit/kbar).\nEnsure that the required sample volume is similar to that of a standard 3 mm diameter NMR tube (~300μL).\nIntroduce the 15N-labeled sample with a glass pipette into the zirconia tube. Make sure the sample seats at the bottom of the tube. Complete with 200 μL of mineral oil to prevent the sample from mixing with the transmission liquid (e.g., water). Fill the rest of the tube with transmission liquid.\nPut a single-use O-ring on top of the zirconia tube and slide the tube into the base (Figure 1A,B). Then, connect the tube to the high-pressure tether line and tighten the base to the cell first by hand. Then, apply 14.7 Nm of torque to prevent leaks at lower pressure (Figure 1C,D).\nTo check the integrity of the pressure cell assembly, pressurize the tube up to 300 bar outside the spectrometer using cell support and containment vessel. Wait for 15 min, reset the pressure to 1 bar and check for leaks with a clean lint-free wipe.",
    "Insert the unpressurized tube into the spectrometer by carefully guiding the tether line. Slide the tube in the spectrometer until reaching the sample sitting position (Figure 1E).\nLock, shim, match, and tune the 1H and 15N channels as usual.\n\tNOTE: Shims for high-pressure rated zirconia tubes are very different from standard NMR tubes. It is recommended to save the optimized shims for future use.\nSet up a 1H-15N-HSQC or TROSY-HSQC and record a reference experiment at atmospheric conditions (1bar).\n2. Recording high-pressure NMR experiments\nGradually increase the pressure from 1 bar to 2.5 kbar with 500 bar increments to test the overall stability of the protein. Set the speed of the pressure pump by default at ~18 bar/s. If the precise folding/unfolding rates are not known, let the sample equilibrate 15-20 min after each 500-bar increment. Record a spectrum at 2.5 kbar.\nGradually decrease the pressure back to 1 bar with 500 bar steps to test the reversibility of the pressure perturbation. Record another spectrum at atmospheric conditions and compare the chemical shifts and peak intensities with that of the reference spectrum previously recorded in the same conditions.\n\tNOTE: If the native crosspeaks are more intense after the pressure run, it may indicate that small aggregates present in solution at atmospheric pressure may have dissociated and properly refolded. On the other hand, a loss in the intensity or significant chemical shift changes suggest that the protein may experience a non-reversible misfolding in high-pressure conditions.\nRecord a series of 2D experiments from 1 bar to 2.5 kbar every 500 bar. It is recommended to record additional experiments near the inflection point of the folding/unfolding transition to improve the precision of the fit.\n3. Analyzing peak intensity changes",
    "Process all the spectra and transfer the backbone assignment from the reference spectrum at 1 bar to the spectrum recorded at 500 bar, and then transfer the assignment from 500 bar to 1 kbar and so forth.\n\tNOTE: Because pressure induces a non-uniform shift of 1H and 15N chemical shifts, do not simply copy the backbone assignment from one spectrum to the next. Adjust it manually.\nIn Sparky menu, click on Peak > Peak List (lt). In the Peak List window, click on Options and select the option to display both Frequencies (ppm) and Data Height. Save the list obtained for each spectrum.\nIn a curve fitting software, copy the crosspeak identity and peak intensity values to have the pressure values (in bar) as the X-axis variable and the intensity as the Y-axis variable.\nIf a complete or near complete (>80%) unfolding is observed, fit the individual peak intensity profiles to extract the free energy and volume change upon unfolding, respectively, using a simple two-state model:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62701/62701eq01.jpg                                     Eq. 1",
    "Where, \"I\" is the observed intensity of a crosspeak at a given pressure p and IF is the intensity of the same crosspeak in a fully folded state. R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, ΔGU0 the standard Gibbs free energy difference between the unfolded and folded states at atmospheric pressure p0 (1 bar), and ΔVu the volume change upon unfolding. With the pressure p in bar and temperature T in kelvin, R = 1.987 cal/K, ΔGU0 is in cal/mol, and ΔVU is in cal/mol/bar. Multiply the ΔVU values obtained from the fit by 41.84 to convert into mL/mol. ΔVU values are typically in the range of -50 to -150 mL/mol for globular proteins22. Here, all the parameters are expressed with regard to the unfolding reaction but can easily be converted into folding reaction parameters (ΔGU0 = -ΔGF0 and ΔVU = -ΔVF).\n4. Analyzing chemical shift changes\nArrange the columns in the software in order to have pressure points as variable and the 1H chemical shifts extracted from Sparky lists as the Y-axis.\nFit the pressure dependence of the 1H chemical shifts to a simple quadratic equation:\n\tδ(p) = δ0(p0) + B1(p-p0) + B2 (p-p0)2                    Eq. 2\n\tWhere, δ(p) is the measured 1H chemical shift of a crosspeak at a given pressure p and δ0(p0) the 1H chemical shifts of the same crosspeak in the reference spectrum recorded at 1 bar. B1 and B2 represent the first and second-order parameters expressed in ppm/bar and ppm/bar2, respectively.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
