    "Please read Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) of all materials prior to use and use safety precautions at all times.\n1. Synthesis of Zinc Oxide Needles\nPrepare 250 mL of a 0.04 M Zn(NO3)2*6H2O solution by adding 2.9749 g of zinc nitrate to 250 mL of water.\nPrepare 150 mL of 1 M NaOH by adding 6 g of NaOH to 150 mL of water.\nSet up a mineral oil bath on a hot plate with stirrer, and submerge a 500-mL round bottom flask into the oil bath at room temperature.\nAdd 250 mL of Zn(NO3)2*6H2O to the flask and begin stirring the reaction.\nAdd 150 mL NaOH solution (a white precipitate will form briefly and then disappear as the two solutions continue to mix). Stir for 2 h uncovered.\nHeat the flask to 55 - 60 °C and continue stirring for 24 h.\nTurn off the heat and allow solution to cool to room temperature while stirring.\nFilter the solution on a Büchner funnel with an 11 µm pore size and allow to dry overnight, uncovered. When the filter paper is no longer wet from the poured solution and a white powder has formed over the funnel holes, the particles are fully dried.\nCollect ZnO needles and prepare for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to confirm the needle-like morphology. Briefly, mount carbon tape onto a pin stub and use a metal spatula to smear the ZnO needles onto the carbon tape. Sputter coat with 8 mm iridium at a density of 22.4 g/cm3 and acquire images at 10 kV.\n2. Addition of Sacrificial Zinc Layer on Microscope Slides for HCl Induced Release of PEG\nPrepare zinc acetate solution by dissolving 1.756 g of zinc acetate in 200 mL of methanol.",
    "Clean 3\" x 1\" plain microscope slides with 70% ethanol and a disposable wipe. Allow to air dry for 10 min.\nPlace a 150-mm glass Petri dish onto a hot plate and preheat to 150 - 160 °C.\nUsing a glass pipet with a pipet bulb, hold the glass slides with tweezers and coat slides by applying 5 drops of zinc acetate, forming a thin layer dispersed on the slide. Allow excess solution to drip back into stock solution.\nPlace the slide in the pre-heated Petri dish (150 - 160 °C) with the zinc acetate coated side facing up. Leave on the hotplate for 15 min.\nRemove the slide with tweezers and allow it to cool to room temperature. The slide will appear to be coated with white streaks.\nRemove any excess zinc that is remaining on the slides using a disposable wipe to remove prominent white streaks. The surface should be uniform.\nExpose the the prepared slides to UV light in a biosafety hood for at least 1 h to ensure sterility.\n\tCaution: UV light is harmful to eyes and exposed skin. Avoid direct exposure to eyes or skin and turn off electrical supply when not using.\n3. Preparation of Silicone Isolators\nCut silicone sheet into squares less than 1\" x 1\" (isolators must be able to fit in a 6-well dish).\nPunch 8 - 12 mm holes in the center of the squares with a biopsy punch.\nAutoclave silicone isolators for 20 min at 121.0 °C and 1.12 kg/cm.\n4. Preparation of PEG solution and PEG Gel Synthesis\nNote: Functionalization and polymerization of PEG has been extensively explored and detailed previously by our lab and others.8,10,11,13,14,15,16,17",
    "Combine the RGD cell adhesive peptide with acryloyl-PEG-NHS in 50 mM sodium bicarbonate (pH 8.5) at a 1:1 molar ratio to enable functionalization of the amine terminus of the peptide with the acrylate moiety, a biochemical reaction that has been previously characterized to yield greater than 85% efficiency.17\nPrepare photo-initiator by mixing 2,2-Dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone with 1-Vinyl-2-pyrrolidone at a concentration of 300 mg/mL.\nIn separate 1.5 mL tubes, weigh out the following: 20 mg of ZnO needles, 12.5 mg of PEG-DA, and 2.5 mg of PEG-RGD.\nSuspend 20 mg of ZnO needles in 270 µL of 10% FBS/PBS solution; vortex to mix (approximately 15 s).\nBriefly (<1 s) spin the solution in a benchtop mini centrifuge to bring any ZnO aggregates to the base of the tube.\nCollect 250 µL from the top of the ZnO solution, to ensure that aggregates remain at the bottom of the tube. Combine with PEG-DA and PEG-RGD to create a PEG solution with approximately 2.5 mM RGD. Vortex to mix (approximately 15 s).\nAdd 2 µL of acetophenone/n-vinyl pyrrolidone photo-initiator and vortex briefly to mix (approximately 5 s).\nAdd 20 µL of the polymer solution along the center of the ZnO coated slides.\nSlowly lower a second slide on top, with the ZnO coating face down (the PEG solution should be between two ZnO coated layers). Try to prevent the formation of any air bubbles. Move the slides laterally along the major axis to allow any bubbles to escape and to spread the solution to a thin layer. Cover the majority of the slide with the polymer solution. Create a slight overhang with the top slide to ensure that the slides can be pulled apart in later steps.\nCrosslink the slides under a 365 nm UV lamp (approximately 10 mW/cm2) for 15 min.",
    "5. Release of PEG Gels from Glass Slides\nApply pressure to the overhanging slide and manually pull the two slides apart at a slow pace in order avoid cracking the slides. Allow the gels to dry for at least 5 min, or overnight.\nPlace the slide in a sterile 25 mm glass Petri dish and gently pour the 1 M HCl solution onto the slide, using only enough to cover the slide (approximately 10 - 20 mL). Gently rock the Petri dish; the gel should begin to lift off the slide as the HCl dissolves the sacrificial zinc coating and needles. Once the gel is free from the slide, pour the HCl back into the stock solution.\nRinse the gel by gently pouring approximately 25 mL of 1x PBS into the Petri dish until the slide and gel are submerged. Carefully pour off PBS into a waste container.\nGently pour approximately 25 mL of 1x PBS into the Petri dish until the gel is floating in the solution.\nUsing tweezers, carefully slide the silicone isolator under the gel and lift the gel onto it.\nTransfer the isolator and the gel into a 6-well dish filled with sterile 1x PBS.\nRepeat this process until all of the gels have been removed from the slides and are soaking in PBS. Expose the prepared gels to UV light in a biosafety hood for at least 1 h to ensure sterility.\n6. Seeding Cell Bilayers\nPrepare A549 cells for seeding. Briefly, rinse a 75 cm2 flask with 5 mL of 1x PBS, add 3 mL of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA and let sit for 2 - 3 min at 37 °C.",
    "Mechanically agitate the flask, quench the reaction with 3 mL Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and collect into a 15-mL conical flask. Rinse with an additional 4 mL of complete Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media and collect into the same conical. Spin cells at 475 x g for 6 min.\nWhile cells are spinning down, add a small drop of complete Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium to each well of a 6-well plate. Use tweezers to transfer the silicone isolators with the gels into the new 6-well plate, such that the gel is resting on the drop of media. Now that gels are spread into a thin layer, check to ensure that there are no large holes visible to the eye. This should be done immediately prior to cell seeding to avoid drying and cracking of the gels.\nResuspend cells in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at a concentration of 6 x 105 cells/mL. Add the cell suspension drop wise to the center of the gel, trying to maintain a meniscus in the punched out area of the silicone membrane. Allow cells to adhere for 4 h.\nAfter 4 h, add 0.5 mL of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Complete Medium to the well and incubate overnight at 37 °C to allow for complete adhesion.\nThe following day, prepare HUVECs for cell seeding.\n\t\nRinse a 75 cm2 flask with 5 mL of 1X PBS, add 3 mL of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA and let sit for 2 - 3 min at 37 °C.\nMechanically agitate the flask, quench the reaction with 3 mL M199 media with 20% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1% growth supplement, and collect into a 15-mL conical.",
    "Rinse with 4 mL of M199 complete media and collect into the same conical. Spin cells at 475 x g for 6 min.\nWhile cells are spinning down, add a small drop of complete medium 199 to each well in a new 6-well plate. Place a new silicone isolator in the well with the drop of media in the center of the silicone.\nUsing tweezers, carefully flip the silicone isolator supporting the PEG gel with A549 cells onto the isolator in the new 6-well plate.\nResuspend HUVECs at a concentration of 6 x 105 cells/mL and add the cell suspension to the center of the flipped gel drop wise, trying to maintain a meniscus on the gel within the punched out area of the silicone membrane. Allow cells to adhere for 2 h.\nAfter 2 h, gently add 2 mL of M199 complete media to each well.\n7. Immunofluorescence\nCarefully remove media from gels with a manual pipette and add approximately 500 µL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) to the center of the gel where the cells are seeded. Let sit for 30 min at room temperature.\n\t​Caution: PFA is a toxic chemical; wear protection and ensure handling is done in a biological safety cabinet.\nCarefully remove the PFA and add approximately 500 µL of 2% BSA in PBS to each gel. Let sit for 1 h at room temperature.\nCarefully remove BSA. Prepare primary antibodies at a dilution of 1:100 in 2% BSA in PBS, and add 500 µL to each gel. Let sit for 1 h at room temperature. Rinse gently with 500 µL of 1x PBS.",
    "Repeat the same process with the secondary antibodies. Use following antibodies: 1) anti-human CD144 (VE-Cadherin) clone 16B1; 2) anti-human CD324 (E-Cadherin) clone 6714; 3) anti-human CD31 (PECAM-1) clone C-20; 4) anti-A549; 5) anti-mouse FITC; 6) anti-goat Alexa Fluor 647. To visualize F-actin, add 500 µL of Phalloidin (10 µg/mL in PBS) for 20 min.\nCarefully remove secondary antibodies or phalloidin and add 500 µL of DAPI (0.1 µg/mL) for 20 min. Carefully remove DAPI solution and gently add 1.5 mL of 1x PBS to each well so that gels are in suspension.\n\t\nUsing tweezers and silicone isolators, transfer one gel to a glass slide. Do this for each gel immediately before imaging, and replace gels into PBS solution after imaging.\nAlternatively, mount gels using a DAPI mounting medium. Seal well the samples with nail polish, acquire images within 2 days to prevent drying and cracking of the gel. Refer to Table 1 for troubleshooting.\nSubscription Required.
