    "Diadenylate cyclase assay with radiolabeled ATP coupled with TLCUntil Step A6, work on ice.Exchange the buffer of purified proteins to DisA cyclase buffer (e.g., via dialysis, see Notes).Determine the molar concentration of proteins (see Notes).Setup of the reaction:Calculate the volume of DisA required to achieve a concentration of 5 µM in 20 µl.Pipette the required volume of DisA into a 1.5 ml reaction tube (i.e., if the DisA stock has a concentration of 50 µM, you will need to take 2 µl).Fill up to a total volume of 19.5 µl with DisA cyclase buffer.From now on, work behind a radiation shield and use filter tips (see Notes).Add 0.5 µl [32P]-ATP to the reaction (final concentration: ~83 nM in 20 µl).Use 19.5 µl DisA cyclase buffer with 0.5 µl [32P]-ATP as a control for ATP migration.Incubate reactions for 60 min at 30 °C in the heat block.Pipette 5 µl 0.5 M EDTA, pH 8 into 1.5 ml reaction tubes (one tube per reaction).Add 5 µl of each reaction to a tube containing EDTA to stop diadenylate cyclase reaction.Spot the mixture from Step A10 on the cellulose side of a thin-layer (TL) plate (each spot should be ~1.5 cm from the bottom and lateral edges of the TL plate as well as other spots; also see Notes).Let the spots dry completely at room temperature (RT).Fill TLC chamber with TLC running buffer (buffer should be ~1 cm deep).Place the TL plate in the TLC chamber with spotted samples close to the buffer without touching it.Incubate TLC until the liquid front is ~1 cm from the upper edge of the TL plate (this can take up to ~2.5 h).Remove TL plate from the chamber and let dry at RT (overnight or at least 45 min in fume hood).",
    "Place an erased imaging plate (IP) into an exposure cassette.Wrap TL plate completely into plastic wrap (see Notes) and place with the cellulose side down on top of the IP for exposure.The exposure time may vary depending on the optimal signal-to-noise ratio, but ~30 min exposure will suffice in most cases.Remove the TL plate from the cassette and check cassette and IP for radioactive contamination using the contamination monitor (see Notes).If no contamination is present, scan the IP in the  Typhoon FLA 7000  using the laser at 650 nm and IP filter.Phosphodiesterase assay with radiolabeled c-di-AMP coupled with TLCUntil Step B7, work on ice.Exchange the buffer of purified AtaC to PDE reaction buffer (e.g., via dialysis, see Notes).Determine the molar concentration of AtaC (see Notes).If you want to perform competition with unlabeled nucleotides, proceed with Step B5, without competition proceed with Step B6.Setup of the reaction with competition:Calculate the volume of AtaC required to achieve a concentration of 100 nM in 20 µl.Pipette the required volume of AtaC into a 1.5 ml reaction tube (i.e., if the AtaC stock has a concentration of 1 µM, you will need to take 2 µl).Fill up to a total volume of 17.5 µl with PDE reaction buffer.Set up 1 mM solutions of each unlabeled nucleotide (c-di-AMP, c-di-GMP, cAMP) in ddH2O.Add 2 µl of each nucleotide per reaction in Step B5c.Set up a reaction with 2 µl ddH2O as negative control for competition.Proceed with Step B7.Setup of the reaction without competition:Calculate the volume of AtaC required to achieve a concentration of 100 nM in 20 µl.Pipette the required volume of AtaC into a 1.5 ml reaction tube (i.e., if the AtaC stock has a concentration of 1 µM, you will need to take 2 µl).Fill up to a total volume of 19.",
    "5 µl with PDE reaction buffer.Proceed with Step B7.From now on, work behind a radiation shield and use filter tips (see Notes).Dilute [32P]-c-di-AMP 1:20 in PDE reaction buffer and add 0.5 µl to the reaction (final concentration: ~2 nM in 20 µl).Use 19.5 µl PDE reaction buffer with 0.5 µl of 1:20 diluted [32P]-c-di-AMP as a control for c-di-AMP migration.Incubate reactions for 60 min at 30 °C in the heat block.To stop enzymatic reaction, incubate at 95 °C for 5 min.Centrifuge reactions at maximal speed for 3 min.Spot 5 µl supernatant of each reaction on the cellulose side of a thin-layer (TL) plate (each spot should be ~1.5 cm from the bottom and lateral edges of the TL plate and other spots).Let the spots dry completely at room temperature (RT).Fill TLC chamber with TLC running buffer (buffer should be ~1 cm high).Place the TL plate in the TLC chamber with spotted samples close to the buffer without touching it.Incubate TLC until the liquid front is ~1 cm from the upper edge of the TL plate (this can take up to ~2.5 h).Remove TL plate from the chamber and let dry at RT (overnight or at least 45 min in fume hood).Place an erased imaging plate (IP) into an exposure cassette.Wrap TL plate completely into plastic wrap (see Notes) and place with the cellulose side down on top of the IP for exposure.The exposure time may vary depending on the optimal signal-to-noise ratio, but ~60 min exposure will suffice in most cases.Remove the TL plate from the cassette and check cassette and IP for radioactive contamination using the contamination monitor.If no contamination is present, scan the IP in the  Typhoon FLA 7000  using the laser at 650 nm and IP filter.",
    "IEX AtaC activity assaySet up 100 µl reactions containing 100 nM protein, 62.5 µM-2,000 µM substrate (e.g., c-di-AMP) and 1x reaction buffer. Control reactions containing protein or substrate only are necessary to exclude nonspecific results.Incubate the reaction at 37 °C for 1 h.Stop the reaction by transferring the complete reaction mix into a Microcon-30kDa Centrifugal Filter Unit and spinning for 10 min at 14,000 x g. This ultrafiltration step separates the protein from its reaction products, which are obtained in the filtrate.Repeat Step C3 if there is still liquid in the filter.Wash the filter by adding 100 µl running buffer A and repeating Step C3.Fill up the filtrate with running buffer A to 500 µl.Equilibrate an ion exchange column (1 ml Resource-Q or Mono-Q) in running buffer A.Inject the sample from step 6 and use a linear gradient from running buffer A to B (i.e., 0-40% B, 20 CV). Set the detection wavelength on 260 nm or 280 nm, if 260 nm is not possible."
