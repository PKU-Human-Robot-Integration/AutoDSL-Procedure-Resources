To examine structural and functional changes in synapses after peripheral nerve injury, we perform transection of the infraorbital nerve, which is the second branch of the trigeminal nerve and conveys tactile information from the whiskers.\nMouse anesthesia\nAnesthetize a mouse (older than 3 weeks) by 2–3% isoflurane in an anesthesia induction chamber for 5 min (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/933-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Development of mouse model for the infraorbital nerve (ION) cut\n(A) A setup for mouse surgery.\n(B) Exposed ION. Scale bar, 5 mm.\n(C) No running ION after ION cut (IONC). Scale bar, 5 mm.\nAnesthesia is maintained by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of medetomidine (0.3 mg/kg), midazolam (4 mg/kg), and butorphanol (5 mg/kg) in saline (0.9% NaCl).\nNote: We use C57 BL/6 wild type mice or transgenic mice produced from C57 BL/6 genetic background of both sexes for this study. Synaptic remodeling in the thalamus is observed both in male and female mice. Mice in the age range of 3–8 weeks old, which corresponds to the period after the developmental synapse remodeling and maturation in the whisker thalamus (Takeuchi et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]), are used.\nUnilateral digestion of the infraorbital nerve\nPlace a mouse on a heating pad (40°C) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) and make a vertical incision between the whisker pad and the eye (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nExpose the infraorbital nerve under a microscope using two forceps (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). The nerve should be freed from the connective tissue without bleeding. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]",
    "Locally anesthetize the nerve by applying 2% xylocaine with 1:80,000 adrenaline on the surface of the nerve using a 1-mL syringe with a 26- or 27-gauge needle.\nLift the nerve up and cut the nerve at a central site first and then a peripheral site at a distance of 1–2 mm from the central site to prevent axonal regeneration (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nPostoperative care\nAfter suturing the skin, inject atipamezole (0.1 mg/kg) intraperitoneally to reverse the sedative effect of medetomidine.\nReturn the mouse to the home cage and house until the electrophysiological or histological experiment is performed.\nNote: Synaptic remodeling in the thalamus is induced 5–6 days from the nerve cut (Takeuchi et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]).\nCritical: Operation should be terminated within 30 min because sedative effect of medetomidine usually continues only 30 min from the intraperitoneal injection. We recommend continuous administration of 0.5–1% isoflurane (or sevoflurane) in addition to medetomidine injection.\nStereotaxic injection\nTiming: 25–60 min\nRefer to ‘‘materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]’’ for information about reagents used. The timing and workflow are depicted in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/933-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. The timing and workflow of stereotaxic injection\nMouse anesthesia\nAnesthetize a mouse by 2–3% isoflurane in an anesthesia induction chamber for 5–10 min (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nAnesthesia is maintained by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of medetomidine (0.3 mg/kg), midazolam (4 mg/kg), and butorphanol (5 mg/kg) in saline (0.9% NaCl).\nNote: When the operation is expected to be prolonged (more than 25 min), apply 0.5–1% isoflurane continuously to maintain anesthesia. Body temperature should be monitored and maintained during the operation.\nCraniotomy\nPlace the anesthetized mouse in a stereotaxic apparatus using an auxiliary ear bar (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Apply 2% xylocaine jelly to the outer ear for local anesthesia using a swab before the auxiliary ear bar is attached.",
    "Apply 0.3% ofloxacin gel to both eyes using a swab to protect eyes during the operation.\nMake a skin incision to expose a skull after local anesthesia with 2% xylocaine jelly application.\nAdjust the nose position using an incisor bar until z coordinates of bregma and lambda become the same.\nDrill the skull above the marked sited using a micromotor system with a steel bur. To reduce heat damage of the brain, the drilling should be paused by cooling with saline of 20°C–25°C. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nNote: Diameter of the drilled hole is typically around 0.5 mm.\nInjection using a Hamilton syringe (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2])\nAttach a 10 μL Hamilton syringe with a stainless-steel needle to a syringe holder connected with a microprocessor-controlled injector.\nCritical: We recommend the use of a 35-gauge beveled needle to reduce brain damage. After the injection, the Hamilton syringe with a needle should be washed 2–3 times with water and then with 70% ethanol.\nFill the injection solution into the needle from the tip.\nMove the syringe to the surface of the drilled site.\nInsert the needle into the target depth of the brain and inject the solution continuously.\nRemove the needle.\nNote: After the injection, we recommend the needle remained in place for at least 5 min before being withdrawn. Volume of the injection solution typically ranges between 100 and 500 nL. Injection is completed within 5 min. The speed of the injection is adjusted to 40–100 nL/min.\nFill the drilled hole with hemostatic gelatin sponge (e.g., Spongel, see ‘‘key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]’’) and close the scalp wound.\nInject atipamezole (0.1 mg/kg) intraperitoneally to reverse the sedative effect of medetomidine.\nReturn the mouse to the home cage and house until the electrophysiological or histological experiment is performed.",
    "Note: Injection by air pressure can be performed using Picospritzer as described in the recent protocol (Okamoto et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). When you need to inject into more restricted site or you need to reduce neuronal damages, iontophoretic delivery is available as described below (step 7).\nIontophoretic delivery using a glass pipette (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2])\nPull borosilicate glass capillaries (1 or 1.5 mm O.D.) using a single pull with a micropipette puller (P1000 or P97, Sutter Instrument).\nNote: We use a single cycle for pulling an injection pipette using the micropipette puller (P-1000 or P-97, Sutter Instrument) to obtain pipettes with long tapers (e.g., step 1: heat, ramp; pull, 50; velocity, 200; delay, 250; pressure, 500).\nCut off the tip of a pulled-pipette using scissors (tip diameter, 20–50 μm).\nDraw the injection solution into the pipette tip by capillary action and backfill saline slowly using the 1-mL syringe with a flexible needle. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nInsert an Ag/AgCl wire into the pipette and attach the pipette to the pipette holder.\nMove the pipette to the surface of the drilled site.\nInsert the pipette into the target depth of the brain and apply current with 7-s on/off cycles for 20–30 min using an iontophoresis pump. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nCritical: Current polarity (positive or negative) depends on the reagent and the solvent used (e.g. ddH2O, saline, or 0.1 M PBS). Current intensity depends on the tip diameter or the target region and usually ranges between 0.3–5 μA. To make focal injection, lower current intensity is suitable for injection into the neocortex (Ueta et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]), while larger one is necessary for injection into dense structures such as the thalamus and brainstem (Ueta and Miyata, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]).",
    "Remove the pipette. Leaving the pipette before withdrawn is not necessary when the diameter of the pipette is 20 μm, because the injection solution does not leak out from such narrow tip (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/933-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Focal injection using iontophoresis\n(A) A retrograde tracer, Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated cholera toxin subunit B (CTB647, 0.2% in ddH2O), is iontophoretically delivered to the dorsal part of the thalamic ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM). VPM is identified by VGLUT2 immunohistochemistry using a guinea pig anti-VGluT2 antibody and an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody. Gray-scale images are acquired using an epifluorescence microscope (Axio Scope.A1, Carl Zeiss) equipped with a cooled CCD camera (QSI RS 6.1, Quantum Scientific Imaging) and pseudocolored using Adobe Photoshop software. D, dorsal; L, lateral; VPL, ventral posterolateral nucleus. Scale bar, 0.5 mm.\n(B) Retrogradely labeled cells in the ventral part of the principal trigeminal nucleus of the brainstem (Pr5) in the contralateral hemisphere. M, medial. Scale bar, 0.5 mm.\nCarry out postoperative care as described above.\nNote: For local depletion of microglia, PLX3397, which inhibits microglial proliferation, or clodronate liposomes, which induces microglial apoptosis, is available (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). For local activation of microglia, lipopolysaccharides is available (refer to ‘‘key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]’’) (Ueta and Miyata, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]). Genetic regulation of local microglia by such as the diphtheria toxin receptor expression system using transgenic mouse lines (Willis and Vukovic, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]), or virally-introduced DREADD system are also useful (Grace et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). These transgenic mouse lines or DREADD expressing viral vectors under microglial promoter are commercially available from the Jackson Laboratory or Addgene.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/933-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Local and brain-wide depletion of microglia",
    "(A) Clodronate liposomes, which induce apoptosis of microglia, are locally injected to the brainstem using a Hamilton syringe. No immunoreactivity against a myeloid cell marker Iba1 is found in the injection site. Immunohistochemistry is performed using a rabbit anti-Iba1 antibody and an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody. Gray-scale images are acquired using the epifluorescence microscope same as in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] and inverted using Adobe Photoshop software. Scale bar, 0.5 mm (left) or 0.2 mm (right).\n(B) Brain-wide microglia are depleted by systemic administration of PLX3397, which inhibits microglial proliferation. An arrow indicates a remaining Iba1-positive cell in the brainstem. Scale bar, 0.2 mm.\nFocal injection using iontophoresis is also useful for neuronal tracing from a restricted area (Ueta et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]). For example, we can successfully obtain retrogradely labeled cells in the whisker region in the brainstem, which corresponds to the ventral part of the principal trigeminal nucleus (Pr5), by a small injection (100–200 μm of the diameter) restricted in the whisker thalamus, which corresponds to the dorsal part of the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). In this protocol, Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated cholera toxin subunit B is used as a retrograde tracer (0.2%, dissolved in 0.1 or 0.05 M PBS) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). We have previously utilized Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated cholera toxin subunit B (0.2%) and obtained successful retrograde labeling from the restricted cortical layers (Ueta et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]).\nWhole-cell patch-clamp recording using acute brain slices\nTiming: ≥2 h\nThe timing and workflow are depicted in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/933-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. The timing and workflow of preparation of acute brain slices\nPreparation of solutions (refer to ‘‘materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]’’)\n10× aCSF stock solution\n1M CaCl2 solution\n1M MgCl2 solution\nCutting solution\nIntracellular pipette solution for voltage-clamp or current-clamp recording\nPreparation of acute brain slices",
    "Dilute the 10× aCSF stock solution to 1 L with ddH2O, add 3.6 g glucose (20 mM), and bubble with a mixture of 95% O2 and 5% CO2.\nAdd 2 mL of 1M CaCl2 solution (2 mM) and 1 mL of 1M MgCl2 solution (1 mM).\nTransfer 100–150 mL of aCSF to a glass beaker and place it in the water bath adjusted to 32°C. Bubble this aCSF solution continuously.\nBubble the cutting solution on ice.\nNote: To improve recovery of neurons, add Na-ascorbate (5 mM), Na-pyruvate (3 mM), and thiourea (2 mM) to both aCSF and the cutting solution. All of Na-ascorbate, Na-pyruvate, and thiourea should be removed from aCSF during recording. Alternatively, add lactic acid (4 mM) instead of Na-ascorbate, Na-pyruvate, and thiourea (Ueta et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]). Lactic acid is also removed from aCSF during recording.\nAfter a deep anesthesia of a mouse with isoflurane, perfuse 5 mL of the cooled cutting solution transcardially using a 10 mL syringe with a 21-gause syringe needle within 1 min.\nNote: More details about transcardial perfusion are described in the step 13.\nDecapitate, remove the brain, and soak it into the cutting solution on ice for 1–3 min.\nCritical: Removing the brain and soaking it in the air-bubbled cutting solution after decapitation should be done quickly to avoid neuronal damages or death.\nTrim the brain on a filter paper using a razor blade or a surgical blade.\nGlue the brain block onto the electrical-taped specimen disk using cyanoacrylate (Aron alpha). Glue a block of gelatin (2–3%) behind the brain block. Place the disk onto the buffer tray with the cutting solution continuously bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2.",
    "Cut sagittal slices of 250- or 300-μm thickness including the whisker thalamus (VPM) using a vibratome with a razor blade and collect on the holding chamber in the water bath. Cutting speed is basically 0.04 mm/s (VT1200S, Leica Microsystems). Frequency amplitude normally ranges between 0.4 and 0.5 mm (VT1200S). Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nNote: A double edge razor blade is cut in half using tinner’s snips and is attached to blade holder of the vibratome. We can cool the buffer tray with ice or icepacks and apply the sherbet-like chilled cutting solution in the buffer tray. Temperature during slice cutting may affect various physiological properties probably depending on the cell type or the age of animals (e.g., Eguchi et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). It is important to select appropriate methods depending on the application or the purpose of experiments.\nAfter cutting, incubate brain slices in the aCSF solution for 30 min at 32°C using a water bath and then for at least 30 min at 20°C–25°C until use.\nNote: Electrophysiological recording is normally finished within 6–8 h from the slice cutting. To obtain synaptic responses, we recommend to finish recordings within 4–6 h from the decapitation.\nAssessment of number of innervated axons by recording of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in individual neurons of the whisker thalamus (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/933-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. A setup for whole-cell patch clamp recording and example experiments\n(A) A setup for patch-clamp experiments.\n(B) Estimation of innervated axon numbers by excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) recording from a thalamic VPM neuron under voltage-clamp.\nTo block inhibitory postsynaptic currents, add GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline methochloride (10 μM) and GABAB receptor antagonist CGP55845 hydrochloride (1 μM) to the perfusing aCSF continuously bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Temperature of aCSF is maintained at 31°C–32°C using a line heater (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).",
    "Establish a whole-cell patch on a thalamic neuron which is identified using a near-infrared camera (C3077-79, Hamamatsu Photonics)-equipped microscope (BX51WI, Olympus Corp.) with a 60× water-immersion objective (numerical aperture = 0.9, Olympus Corp.).\nNote: VPM is visually identifiable in the bright-field images (Takeuchi et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]; 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]). VPM in mice consists of glutamatergic thalamocortical neurons and is mostly devoid of local interneurons.\nEPSC is evoked by an electrical stimulation using a concentric electrode placed on the lemniscal fiber bundle.\nThe number of EPSC steps corresponds to the number of axons innervating a recorded neuron. For example, a single neuron which receives three axonal inputs expresses three EPSC steps when a stimulus intensity is gradually increased, but a neuron receiving a single axonal input expresses a single EPSC step in an all-or-none fashion (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nNote: We use 5 or 6 cycles for pulling a whole-cell patch pipette (4–8 MΩ) using the micropipette puller to obtain pipettes with short tapers (e.g., step 1: heat, ramp; pull, 0; velocity, 19, delay, 1; pressure, 500; step 2: ramp – 5; pull, 0; velocity, 19; delay, 1; steps 3 and 4: heat, ramp – 15; pull, 0; velocity, 19; delay, 1; steps 5 and 6: ramp – 25; pull, 0; velocity, 20; delay, 1). We usually increase or decrease velocity in the last step to correct the tip diameter. The internal solution is kept on ice during recording. A recent detailed protocol for patch-clamp techniques would help your experiments (Manz et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).",
    "Critical: Neurons in the mouse whisker thalamus receive glutamatergic excitatory inputs from lemniscal fibers, which originate from the brainstem, and/or from corticothalamic axons. EPSCs evoked by these two different pathways have different EPSC kinetics and short-term plasticity: lemniscal fiber-evoked EPSCs, fast EPSC decay and paired-pulse depression; corticothalamic EPSCs, slower decay of EPSCs and paired-pulse facilitation (Miyata and Imoto, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nPost hoc visualization of dendritic and axonal morphologies of a recorded neuron.\nAfter recording, the slices of 250- or 300-μm thickness are collected in a glass vial or a 24-well plate, soaked into the fixative solution, and stored for 12–16 h at 4°C. The fixative solution of 2 mL is enough for a single slice.\nNote: The slices can be stored in the fixative solution at 4°C for few weeks. It can be possible to store for longer time (e.g., 2–3 months).\nWash the slices three times with 0.1 M PBS for 10–20 min on a shaker.\nIncubate the slices with fluorescent streptavidin (e.g., Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated streptavidin, 1:500) in 0.1 M PBS with 0.05% Triton X-100 for 2–3 h at 20°C–25°C or 12–16 h at 4°C.\nWash the slices two times with 0.1 M PBS for 5–10 min and then with 0.1 M PB for 5–10 min to remove NaCl.\nMount the slices on a gelatin-coated glass slide (refer to ‘‘materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]’’).\nNote: Use spacers (two sheets of electrical tape, 200 μm thickness for one sheet) when sections are coverslipped not to flatten the slices.\nSeal the sections with antifade mountant and apply a coverslip.\nNote: After fixation, the sections can be resectioned at a thickness of 40 or 50 μm. Such thinner sections are useful for simultaneous immunohistochemical staining (Nagumo et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]) (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/933-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

Troubleshooting 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nNote: Use spacers (Vinyl repair patch, 70 μm thickness) when sections are coverslipped for confocal microscopic observation.\nWhen we need to visualize myeloid cells including microglia, we use anti-Iba1 antibody for immunohistochemistry (refer to “key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]”) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Because anti-Iba1 antibody detects diverse type of myeloid cells, we recommend to use anti-TMEM119 antibody for detecting microglia specifically (refer to “key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]”) (Ueta and Miyata, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]).\nAlternatives: When we only need to acquire lower magnification images (e.g., 2×, 4×, or 5×), we use an aqueous mountant without antifade reagents (e.g., Fluoromount-G)."
