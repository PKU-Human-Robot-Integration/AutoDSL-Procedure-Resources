Isolation of mouse cerebellum\n(A) Anesthetized mouse placed in the rodent induction chamber provided with controlled flow of oxygen and isoflurane vapors. Blue arrow at the inlet indicates the inflow of isofluorane-oxygen vapors and red arrow at the outlet indicates the outflow of waste gases from the induction chamber to the Charcoal Filters.\n(B) Dissection Instruments used for the isolation and preparation of cerebellar slices (a) Spoon, (b) Surgical mayo scissors, (c) surgical blade, (d) fine scissors, (e) fine forceps, (f) spring forceps scissors, (g) spoon micro spatula, (h) spatula and (i) glass Pasteur pipette.",
    "(C) Mouse skull showing the position of Bregma. Dashed white lines indicate the regions for incisions to cut open the skull and expose the whole brain. The white arrows near the dashed lines show the direction of surgical incisions to be made to cut open the mouse skull to expose of the whole mouse brain. Numbers present next to white arrows indicate the order to incisions to be made to expose intact mouse brain. Vertical incisions starting from bregma along the sagittal suture are made till the junction between the cortex and the cerebellum (step 1). The skull is further cut laterally towards both sides as indicated with white horizontal dash lines (step 2 and 3). Make two small incisions below the lateral most side of cerebellum (step 4 and 5) and use forceps to grasp the back of skull flap and slowly lift outward and upward (marked with red curled arrow) to remove the skull that covers the cerebellum (step 6).\n(D) Isolated mouse brain showing different regions. Dashed red lines indicate the region for dissection of the cerebellum from the whole mouse brain.\n(E) Dissected mouse cerebellum in ice cold cutting ACSF solution. Scale bar in panels D, E indicates 4 mm.\nNote: The level of anesthesia was monitored throughout the pedal withdrawal reflex to toe pinch. If any pedal reflex is observed while toe pinching the mouse, it indicates that the animal is not fully anesthetized and should remain in the chamber for longer.\nAlternatives: Mice can be anesthetized using 1 mL of isoflurane applied onto a paper towel kept inside a chamber (Camiré and Topolnik, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). Place a grid above the paper towel so as to avoid direct contact of isoflurane onto the skin of mice as Isoflurane can be a skin irritant.",
    "Expose the skull by cutting the skin using a pair of scissors from the back of the skull to the top. A small pair of mini bone rongeurs or fine scissors (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) can be used to make a hole at the bregma level (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). A small pair of scissors can be used to make rostral-to-caudal cut along the sagittal suture starting from bregma level as marked with white vertical dash lines in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C. After making the incision till the junction between the cortex and the cerebellum, continue cutting the skull laterally towards both sides as indicated with white horizontal dash lines in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C. Make two small incisions below the lateral most side of cerebellum taking care not to damage the tissue. Use the forceps to grasp the back of skull flap and slowly lift outward and upward (marked with red curled arrow) to remove the skull that covers the cerebellum.\nNote: It is always advisable to place the severed head directly onto the ice-cold ACSF sucrose solution immediately after decapitation. This will cool the brain, slow down metabolism and thereby reduces action potential in neurons and thus increases the neuron viability.\nOnce the brain is fully exposed, use a small pair of scissors (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) to cut the optic nerves and then remove the brain from the skull and place it onto a Petri dish containing oxygenated, cold ACSF-Sucrose that is constantly bubbled with carbogen.\nPrepare cerebellar slices from the extracted brain.\nCritical: Steps from 4b to 4d should be completed within a minute to avoid stress to the neurons.\nAllow the brain to chill for approximately 2 min in cold ACSF-Sucrose. Transfer the brain onto the petri dish containing ice cold ACSF-Sucrose that is bubbled with carbogen continuously (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).",
    "Note: Use a spoon (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) to carefully transfer the whole brain to the petri dish containing oxygenated ice cold ACSF-Sucrose.\nNote: Use a piece of filter paper at the bottom of the petri dish containing ice cold ACSF-Sucrose and place the brain on top of the filter paper. Using a filter paper will help the brain to stay in position while dissecting out the cerebellum from the whole brain.\nDissect out the cerebellum from the extracted brain using Scalpel blade No.13 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nGlue the dissected cerebellum onto the agar block that is stuck to the vibratome table (Vibratome -Leica, VT1200) using cyanoacrylate Instant Adhesive (Evobond Super Glue – SG0312). To obtain sagittal sections of the cerebellum, the orientation of the cerebellum adhered to the agar block is such that the flocculonodular lobe is stuck parallel to the agar block and one of the lateral sides of cerebellum touches the vibratome table as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A.\nCritical: Glue is added at the bottom of the cerebellum that touches the vibratome table and a small portion of flocculo-nodular lobe so as to ensure that cerebellum remains adhered to the agar block during the vibratome sectioning. Use a flat spatula (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) to transfer the cerebellum onto the agar block. Take extra precaution while transferring the cerebellum onto the agar block to avoid the whole tissue falling directly onto the glue. In addition, care should be taken to lightly dry the cerebellum onto a piece of paper to ensure correct gluing as wet brain may tend to detach easily from the agar block and vibratome table.\nImmerse vibratome table containing the cerebellum into the vibratome tray filled with ice-cold ACSF-Sucrose bubbled continuously with carbogen (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).",
    "Set the speed and amplitude of the vibratome as 0.16 mm/s and 1.0 mm respectively. Adjust the angle of the blade (Feather Razor Blades, Platinum Coated) such that the cutting edge of blade (white asterisks) is aligned parallel to the top of the mounted cerebellum (red arrow head, Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). Obtain parasagittal cerebellar slices of ∼ 250 μm thickness at a temperature of about ∼ 1°C.\nCritical: Use the vibratome cooler or place ice around the vibratome tray to maintain temperature at ∼ 1°C during sectioning. The cutting edge of the vibratome blades should be aligned parallel to the cerebellum that has been glued to the vibratome table (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nUse a glass Pasteur pipette (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) to transfer the cerebellar slices onto a bath containing oxygenated ACSF-Recovery solution maintained at 34°C (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1370-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Preparation of cerebellar slices and two photon calcium imaging\n(A) The dissected cerebellum is glued to the agar block which is stuck to the vibratome table. Red arrow head indicates the region to glue the cerebellum onto the agar block.\n(B) vibratome showing the cerebellum (red arrow head) in the vibratome tray filled with ice-cold ACSF-Sucrose and blade placed parallel (white asterisks) to the sagittal region of cerebellum. ACSF is continuously bubbled with carbogen (red asterisks) and ice is placed around the vibratome tray (black asterisks) to maintain temperature at ∼1°C during sectioning.\n(C) Cerebellar slices (red arrow head) kept in oxygenated ACSF-Recovery solution in water bath maintained at 34°C.

    "Note: Cerebellar sections will be placed on a nylon mesh fitted to the beaker for adequate oxygenation of the slices (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nLeave the cerebellar slices in oxygenated ACSF-Recovery bath at 34°C for 45 min (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nCritical: Rate of flow of carbogen gas used to bubble ACSF should be maintained carefully so as to avoid cerebellar slices from floating away in the incubation chamber.\nPause point: The experimenter can take a break of 45 min while the slices are kept for recovery.\nAfter 45 min of incubation for recovery, the slices are transferred onto a brain slice holding chamber containing oxygenated ACSF-Normal solution maintained at room temperature (∼22°C) till imaging.\nNote: Brain slice holding chamber consists of a 250 mL beaker fitted with nylon netting and a tube attached for the provision of carbogen gas to flow for the adequate oxygenation of the slices. Rate of flow of carbogen gas should be properly controlled to avoid floating of brain slices in the holding chamber (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nTwo photon calcium imaging\nTiming: 4–6 h per animal\nTwo-photon calcium imaging is performed to measure Ca2+ transients in acute cerebellar slices from Purkinje neurons expressing the genetically encoded calcium sensor, GCaMP6f. This protocol is for measuring excitability and ligand-mediated Ca2+ signals in neurons present with in the tissue slices (ex-vivo preparation).\nAcute cerebellar slices are transferred one at a time to the recording chamber (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D). which is kept under a custom built two-photon laser scanning microscope equipped with a Ti-Sapphire laser (Coherent Chameleon Ultra II).The microscope is equipped with a 20× water-immersion objective (Olympus XLUMPLFLN20XW, 1.0 NA).\nUse a glass Pasteur pipette (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) to transfer the cerebellar slices onto a recording chamber containing oxygenated ACSF-Normal solution maintained at room temperature.",
    "Note: Always use a glass Pasteur pipette to transfer the slices to avoid damage to the tissue slices. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]\nCritical: Continuously perfuse the bath in recording chamber with oxygenated ACSF-normal at room temperature (Hartmann et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nNote: Check the flow of carbogen gas in holding chamber frequently to prevent slices from floating and also to avoid air bubbles from getting accumulated near the slices. Oxygenation to the neurons and its viability in the slices gets affected if air bubble forms near the slices. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]\nPlace a slice anchor gently onto the cerebellar slices in the recording chamber (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nNote: Care should be taken to avoid damage to the tissue while placing the slice anchor onto the slice. Slide anchors help prevent excessive motion artifacts while imaging. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]\nUsing the image acquisition software Scan Image 3.8, click the “focus” button to locate the cells of interest. Locate Purkinje neurons in the cerebellar sections using the basal green fluorescence signal of GCaMP6 and define a region that includes the PN soma and dendrites for scanning.\nNote: It is better to avoid neurons from superficial layers as there could be damage caused to the neurons located at the periphery during dissection. Scanning from neurons located deeper than 50 μm is better.\nCritical: Using the laser intensity controllers in the acquisition software, always set the two photon laser (wavelength ∼930 nm) at a minimal power level so that the baseline green fluorescence is visible minimally. This is in order to avoid phototoxicity during imaging. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]\nClick the “Grab” button in image acquisition software to acquire the fluorescence of each cell in time lapse mode setting time of acquisition per frame as 1 s and images are acquired with frame size of 512 x 512 pixels.",
    "To measure PN excitability and membrane depolarization, 75 mM KCl is added at the10th frame of image acquisition and images are captured for 120 s. This experiment is performed for both control and STIM1PKO Purkinje neurons to compare depolarization evoked Ca2+ kinetics (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], Methods videos S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] and S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nTo assess mGluR1 activation in Purkinje neurons, stimulate the neurons with the mGluR1 agonist Di-Hydroxy Phenyl Glycine (DHPG) (Hartmann et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). About 200 μM DHPG can be applied to the cerebellar slices in ACSF solution at the 10th frame of the image acquisition and images are captured for 600 s (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5], Methods videos S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3] and S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\nNote: Variation in the time taken to respond upon DHPG stimulation is usually seen among PNs of the same slice. One explanation for this is possibly due to the time delay for the DHPG to reach the various PNs present in the area focused under the microscope (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nTo test for the specificity of mGluR1 activation, an mGluR1 antagonist, CPCCOEt can be applied to the neurons in ACSF solution before stimulating it with DHPG. CPCCOEt of 200 μM can be applied (Hartmann et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]) in the bath solution in recording chamber before the image acquisition followed by addition of 200 μM DHPG at the 10th frame of the image acquisition (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]F).\nNote: The length of scan can be varied depending on the evoked Ca2+ kinetics. Care should be taken to minimize scan length to prevent photodamage. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]\nNote: Always make sure to select healthy neurons that are 50 um below the superficial surface as injury during sectioning can affect the viability of neurons and no response will be observed on application of stimulus to the neurons during calcium imaging. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]",
    "Critical: Continuously perfuse the bath in recording chamber with oxygenated ACSF-normal at room temperature (Hartmann et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). Image acquisition should be stopped when the neurons show signs of deteriorating health such as enlarged soma, increase in the basal GCaMP6f fluorescence suggesting enhanced Ca2+ levels, blebbing and fragmentation of dendrites. Signs of deterioration might be observed if the cells are imaged for longer durations (i.e. after 20 minutes in recording chamber) and also if the slices are kept in the incubation chamber for prolonged periods.
