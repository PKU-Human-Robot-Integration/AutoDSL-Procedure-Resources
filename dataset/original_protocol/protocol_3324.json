Fission yeast strains are stocked in 20% glycerol (v/v) at ‒80°C.\nInoculate fission yeast cells from YES plates into 5 mL EMM2. Cultivate for 16–24 h at 27°C in test tubes, which are rotated at around 40 rpm.\nCultivate fission yeast cells in a larger scale.\nMeasure the OD595 value of the yeast culture of step 2.\nAdd a certain amount of the culture to 100 mL EMM2 in 300 mL flasks and cultivate for 24–48 h to reach 0.5 OD595.\nShake the flasks at 125 rpm, at 27°C.\nNote: The doubling time is around 4 h and over, depending on the strains.\nNote: When you want to cultivate cells in a media containing an amino acid as a sole nitrogen source, use the amino-acid supplemented media at steps 2 and 3.\nCritical: We strongly recommend starting the lysis process using the cell culture with OD595 values of over 0.5 to ensure that the wet weight of collected cells is over 150 mg.\nNext yeast cells are harvested and lysed.\nTurn on the multi beads shocker. Set the temperature at 4°C to cool down the rotor.\nHarvest yeast cells.\nWeigh the 1.5 mL microtubes that will be used to collect yeast cells.\nPour half of the culture into a 50 mL centrifuge tube, and centrifuge for 2 min at 4°C, 900 × g.\nRemove the supernatant by decantation. Pour the rest of the culture into the same centrifuge tube, and centrifuge for 2 min at 4°C, 900 × g.",
    "Remove the supernatant by decantation.\nSuspend the yeast pellet in 5 mL ice-cold sterilized RO water and centrifuge for 2 min at 4°C, 900 × g.\nRemove the supernatant by decantation.\nSuspend the yeast pellet in 1 mL ice-cold sterilized RO water. Transfer the suspension into a 1.5 mL microtube that was weighed in advance (step a), and centrifuge for 1 min at 4°C, 2,400 × g.\nRemove the supernatant by aspiration. Weigh the tube to calculate the wet weight of the collected cells using a laboratory scale. You can store the yeast pellets: put the microtube in liquid nitrogen for a few seconds and store them in a ‒80°C deep freezer. Thaw before use.\nIf the wet weight of cells is under 100 mg, add 100 μL lysis buffer to the microtube, and resuspend the cells. If the wet weight is over 100 mg and less than 160 mg, add 200 μL lysis buffer.\nCritical: Loading too many cells in one lysing tube prevents the cells from being completely crushed, resulting in low efficiency of protein extraction; do not dispense more than 160 mg wet cells in one lysing tube.\nPut 0.5 g glass beads into a 2 mL lysing tube and add all the cell suspension prepared at step 6.\nHomogenize cells 10 to 15 times for 30 s at 30 s interval using multi-beads shocker, depending on the amount of cell suspension.\nNote: Observe the cell suspension under a light microscope to confirm that almost all cells are disrupted. After homogenization, be sure to always keep the lysates on ice.",
    "Add 100 μL lysis buffer to the lysing tube after homogenization and make a hole at the bottom of the lysing tube by using a push pin (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Wipe off the homogenized solution from the push pin every time.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3090-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. How to transfer cell lysates from lysing tubes\n(A) Make a hole at the bottom of the lysing tube by using a push pin.\n(B) Set the 2 mL lysing tube on a new 1.5 mL microtube. After centrifugation, the cell lysates can be collected in the bottom tube.\nSet the 2 mL lysing tube on a new 1.5 mL microtube (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]), and centrifuge together for 2 min at 4°C, 20 × g.\nPlace the tubes on ice. Put your finger on the lysing tube to squeeze the extract out of the tube completely.\nAdd lysis buffer to the 1.5 mL microtube so that the total volume will be 900 μL and centrifuge for 10 min at 4°C, 21,500 × g.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 mL microtube as a crude lysate.\nMeasure the protein concentration of the crude lysate using Bradford method.\nTo draw a standard curve, dilute 0.1% BSA using 0.084 M potassium phosphate buffer in 1.5 mL microtubes as shown below. The diluents can be prepared one at a time, or a stepwise dilution can be performed.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3090_9.csv\nDilute 2 μL crude lysate with 18 μL 0.084 M potassium phosphate buffer in 1.5 mL microtubes as the samples for quantification.\nAdd 1 mL Protein Assay Dye Reagent to the standard curve samples and lysate samples.\nVortex for 5–10 s and allow to stand at 20°C–25°C for at least 5 min.\nTake 200 μL from the tubes and dispense them into a 96-well plate.",
    "Measure the OD620 using a Multiskan FC plate reader. Be sure to measure the absorbance of the reacted protein solutions as soon as the process; otherwise, the products aggregate, and the experimenter will not be able to know the correct protein concentration of the cell lysates.\nCalculate the protein concentrations in samples using the standard curve. If the measured value of the lysate sample is larger than that of the standard samples, dilute 1 μL of crude lysate in 19 μL of 0.084 M potassium phosphate buffer, and repeat the procedure starting from step b.\nThreonine deaminase assay\nTiming: 1–1.5 h\nThis step shows the way to measure the activity of threonine deaminase.\nPrepare standard solutions.\nDissolve α-ketobutyrate or pyruvate in RO water to obtain 1.0 mM solution and dilute it first with 0.17 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) to half the concentration.\nDilute the sample prepared at step a to half the concentration with 0.084 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) five more times.\nNote: When you use threonine as a substrate, use α-ketobutyrate; for serine, use pyruvate.\nAdd 10 μL of 30% TCA to each well in 96-well plates.\nAdd 100 μL of standard samples or 0.084 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and 10 μL of 0.2% DNPH in 2 N HCl to wells with 30% TCA, which were prepared at step 16.\nPrepare a substrate solution by dissolving threonine or serine in RO water. Mix the amino acid solution and pyridoxal phosphate solution. The final concentration of the pyridoxal phosphate is 20 μM, and the substrate concentration can be 5–40 mM (threonine) or 10–80 mM (serine).",
    "Critical: We found out that if amino acids are stored with pyridoxal phosphate for a long time, the product amount in the enzymatic assay decreased. It is better to prepare and store the solution independently and mix them just before the test.\nDilute lysate by 0.084 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) in 1.5 mL tubes so that protein concentration will be 1 or 7 μg per 90 μL. Use the lysate with the protein concentration of 1 or 7 μg protein per 90 μL for testing threonine or serine as a substrate, respectively.\nNote: The volume of the mixture that should be prepared depends on the number of experiments.\nDispense 90 μL of the lysate to a 96-well plate containing 10 μL of 30% TCA, then dispense 10 μL solution containing amino acid and pyridoxal phosphate. This well will serve as a sample at t = 0.\nMix substrate and pyridoxal phosphate solution (10 μL) and the lysate (90 μL) in a microtube and incubate at 30°C. If you want to measure the activity at five time points, mix 60 μL of the substrate and pyridoxal phosphate solution and 540 μL of the lysate.\nAfter the specified time of experimenter’s choice, in which the minimum time is 1 min, take 100 μL of the mixture from the microtube to a 96-well plate containing 10 μL of 30% TCA per well (prepared at step 16).\nCritical: Because enzyme reactions undergo every moment, make sure to stop the reaction using 30% TCA just at the moment when the reaction interval reaches the specified time.\nAfter the reaction is stopped, add 10 μL of 0.2% DNPH in 2 N HCl in each well. Incubate the plate at 30°C for 10 min.",
    "Add 100 μL of 2.5 N NaOH to all the wells including standard samples and your cell lysate samples, and allow to stand at 20°C–25°C for 10 min.\nMeasure the OD540 values using a Multiskan FC plate reader.\nCalculate the amount of the reaction product in samples using the standard curve.\nNote: If the measured value of the digested product is larger than the standard samples, reprepare the standard curve using higher concentrations of standard solution.\nOptional: If you want to test enzyme inhibition or activation by amino acids, add isoleucine (around 0.1 mM) or valine (0.1–10 mM) to the substrate solution.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]"
