This procedure details how to extract the brain and prepare slices (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].1–3 and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2991-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Workflow from brain extraction to recordings\nStep 1–3: Brain extraction and slices preparation. Step 4–6: Slices observation. Step 7–10: Paired whole-cell patch-clamp of a tanycyte and a neuron.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2991-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Representative image of the different steps of brain extraction and slices preparation\n1. Cutting the skin along midline of the brain using fine scissors. 2. Upper skull cut off and removed using scissors. 3. The olfactory bulbs and optic nerves are sectioned using micro-scissors and the brain is gently flipped over. 4. The trigeminal nerves are sectioned using micro-scissors and the brain is harvested in aCSF solution. 5. The brain is placed on a damp disk of Whatman paper. 6. The cerebellum and rostral end of the brain are cut out and removed with a razor blade. 7. The rostral surface of the delimited brain block is glued on the vibratome sample holder. 8. The vibratome sample holder with the glued brain is placed in the tank of the vibratome containing ice-cold aCSF. 9. Brain slices are obtained using the vibratome. 10. The collected slices are placed in the incubation chamber.\nDissection.\nFill the dissection tank and the buffer tank of the vibratome with aCSF that has been saturated with oxygen and kept at 4°C.\nAnesthetize the mouse with Isoflurane.\nPlace the mouse in the induction box of a gas anesthesia table for rodents.\nNote: The induction is realized with a concentration of isoflurane of 3%.",
    "Check mouse reflexes (i.e., by pinching its paw) to check if the anesthesia has worked.\nCritical: Isoflurane is dangerous, it is mandatory to use specific equipment to protect the experimenter of Isoflurane vapor.\nEuthanize the mouse by decapitation and quickly immerse its head in ice-cold aCSF.\nExtract the brain into the ice-cold aCSF using microdissection tools.\nCut the skin along the midline of the brain from the neck to the nose with fine scissor and stretch it on each side (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].1).\nHold the head with one hand by the skin flaps, cut around the cranial cavity with fine scissor and remove the top of the skull with forceps (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].2).\nCut the olfactory bulbs perpendicularly and slide micro-scissors at the ventral part of the skull to cut the optic nerves (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].3).\nCritical: If the optic nerves are not cut, the median eminence will be torn during brain harvesting.\nCarefully turn the brain over and drop it into the aCSF by cutting the trigeminal nerves with micro-scissor (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].4).\nMoisten the disk of Whatman paper with aCSF, retrieve the brain with a spatula and place it on top Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].5.\nUsing a razor blade, cut off the cerebellum and the rostral end of the brain to make a block (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].6).\nOptional: For more precision, this step can be done using a brain cutting matrix.\nGlue the rostral surface of the blocked brain on to the vibratome sample holder. To do this, use the bent tip forceps (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].7).\nNote: These steps should be done as quickly as possible to optimize slice survival.\nPreparation of coronal slices of the hypothalamus.\nPlace the vibratome sample holder with the attached brain in the tank containing ice-cold aCSF (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].8).",
    "Note: To optimize median eminence slices, rotate the brain so that cutting begins with the left hemisphere and ends with the right hemisphere.\nDefine the cutting window, carry out rough cutting and then cut the slices to a thickness of 250 μm (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].9).\nWith the dropper, collect slices containing the median eminence and arcuate nucleus and place them in the incubation chamber.\nCritical: Do not stack slices on top of each other and check that they do not move to optimize slice survival (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].10).\nPause point: Allow at the slices to recover at 34°C for 1 h, then leave them at room temperature (about 20°C) until use.\nObservation of slices by video microscopy\nTiming: 20–30 min\nAfter a stabilization period, slices have recovered their physiological properties. The procedure details how to observe slices and identify neurons of interest (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].4–6 and 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2991-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

ARH: arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. ME: median eminence. 3V: third ventricle.\nTurn on all equipment needed for slices observation and patch-clamp recordings.\nPerfusion system to bring newly oxygenated aCSF into the recording chamber,\nComputer with pClamp acquisition software and MetaMorph imaging software,\nMicroscope,\nCamera,\nFluorescent lamp,\nDigidata,\nAmplifier,\nTemperature controller at 32.8°C,\nMicromanipulators.\nUsing a cut dropper, transfer a slice into the recording chamber and immobilize it at the bottom of the chamber with a nylon grid to prevent movement.\nObservation of slices.\nPlace the region of interest under the microscope’s field of observation.",
    "Critical: Check that the cells are healthy. They should have a three-dimensional appearance with a smooth appearing cell membrane and no visible nucleus (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nObserve slices under fluorescence with a 40× objective to locate spontaneously fluorescent POMC neurons expressing the tdTomato protein.\nCircle them with the “drawing” tool of the imaging software.\nLocate the same neurons under IR-DIC.\nNote: At this step, do not move the field of observation.\nPaired whole-cell patch-clamp of a tanycyte and a POMC neuron\nTiming: 1 h\nThe following steps detail how to patch a tanycyte to fill it with a specific compound, then how to patch a neuron to record its electrical activity (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].7–10 and 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2991-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Cell observation under IR-DIC and membrane test recording during pipette approach to obtain a whole-cell configuration\n(A) A pipette filled with intrapipette medium is placed in the bath and a positive pressure is applied to its tip. Visualization of the membrane test of a current in response to the application of a voltage pulse.\n(B) Pipette stuck to the membrane is represented by the dimple (arrow) formed around the pipette tip. At this stage, there is no change in current.\n(C) Positive pressure removal results in a decrease of the current, which corresponds to an increase in resistance between the pipette and the cell up to a gigaohm.\n(D) The rupture of the membrane under the pipette results in a brief suction and an increase of the capacitive transients.\nPosition the electrode pipettes under the microscope.\nThaw an aliquot of the intrapipette medium for tanycytes.\nPut the intrapipette medium in 1 mL syringe with a 22Gx1½\" needle.\nNote: It is a good idea to add a sterile syringe filter between the syringe and the needle.",
    "Place the syringe filled with intrapipette medium on ice.\nFill the tanycyte pipette with its intrapipette medium.\nNote: Do not overfill the pipette. Fill about 1/3 of its length.\nRemove any air bubbles that are visible to the naked eye with a few gentle taps.\nMount the patch pipette on the electrode holder.\nNote: When inserting the patch pipette into the amplifier headstage, avoid scratching the AgCl-coating of the electrode, as a freshly scratched surface will cause an unstable offset potential.\nLocate the pipette under the 40× objective immersed in aCSF and center the tip in the field of view.\nNote: The pipette can be placed directly under the 40× objective or, for greater ease, be placed under a lower magnification first.\nCheck that the pipette tip is not broken.\nApply airflow to verify that the pipette is not clogged and to push any remaining air bubbles out of the pipette.\nApply a small amount of constant positive pressure (between 0.3–0.5 mL) to prevent debris from sticking to the pipette tip.\nNote: The positive pressure depends on the cell type and age of the mice.\nApproach the pipette to just above the surface of the slice without touching it, using the \"coarse\" setting of the micromanipulator.\nNote: To approach the pipette, first lower the objective a little and then follow with the pipette until its tip is focus again. Repeat this operation and stop just above the slice.\nRepeat steps 6a to 6k for the neuron pipette, mounting it on the second headstage of the amplifier. At this step, you need to use the intrapipette solution for neurons.\nWhole cell patch clamp of a tanycyte.",
    "Run the \"membrane test\" protocol of pClamp software in \"bath\" mode to visualize a current in response to the application of a 10 mV voltage pulse during 100 ms (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A).\nDepending on the configuration of the amplifier and digidata, choose the analog output that corresponds to the headstage chosen to patch the tanycyte.\nAdjust the offset potential to 0 and check that it remains stable.\nCheck the resistance of the pipette. It should be between 4 and 6 MΩ.\nUsing the \"fine\" setting of the micromanipulator, lower the pipette onto the center of the cell membrane surface of a tanycyte until a \"dimple\" is created around the pipette tip by the positive pressure (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B).\nNote: Too much positive air pressure or physical pressure by pushing the cell with the pipette tip might cause the cell to move within the slice. The integrity of such a cell may be compromised, and it should not be recorded.\nQuickly relieve the positive pressure and apply gentle suction to draw a part of the membrane into the pipette.\nNote: This suction should be maintained until a tight contact between the pipette wall and the cell membrane, called a gigaseal, is achieved. The quality of the gigaseal formed can be evaluated by the increase in resistance, up to a gigaohm, which corresponds to a decrease in the membrane test current response (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]C). Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\nSwitch the holding potential to −80 mV on the amplifier.\nSwitch to \"patch\" mode.\nOptional: At this step, the capacitance of the pipette can be cancelled. However, since the pipette capacitance depends mainly on the length of the pipette in contact with the extracellular solution, which depends on the liquid level in the recording chamber, the liquid level must remain very stable after pipette capacitance compensation.",
    "Rupture the membrane by applying a brief but strong suction to obtain whole-cell configuration and to deliver the chemical or pharmacological substance of interest.\nNote: The rupture is successful if large capacitive transients in response to a voltage pulse are seen on the scope obtained with “membrane test” protocol (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]D). Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7].\nSwitch to cell mode and check the stability of the whole-cell configuration over 2–3 min.\nNote the access resistance (Ra) value given directly by the cell mode of the “membrane test”.\nOptional: Perform an episodic stimulation protocol, pulse test, corresponding to the application of a voltage pulse of −10 mV for 100 ms. This allows you to calculate the value of the Ra to confirm the value given by the \"membrane test\".\nNote: The access resistance value must be taken at the beginning and end of the recording. If the access resistance changes by more than 20% during the recording, the recording must be excluded. The access resistance provides information on the membrane opening. If it changes by more 20% during recording, this can lead to changes in activity independent of the substance tested. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9].\nPerform the recordings necessary for measurement of the electrical properties of the membrane and allowing functional confirmation that the patched cell is indeed a tanycyte.\nPlot a current-voltage (I-V) curve in voltage-clamp mode by applying a series of 300 ms voltage pulses ranging from −100 mV to +100 mV at 10 mV increments.\nPerform a “gap-free” protocol of pClamp Software to record spontaneous tanycyte activity in current-clamp mode.\nNote: Tanycytes exhibit membrane properties typical of glial cells, including a highly polarized membrane potential (−80 mV), a linear I-V relationship and low membrane resistance (30 MΩ).",
    "Note: It is necessary to consider that unlike other cells, tanycytes of the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus form a network of cells interconnected by gap junctions made up of connexin 43.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] These gap junctions allow the intercellular diffusion of small molecules with a molecular weight of less than 1.5 KDa. Thus, the use of drugs below this molecular weight will result in the diffusion of the substance from one tanycyte to another and the modulation of the targeted cellular pathway in all cells of the network. If the goal of the experiment is to investigate the effect of a substance on a single tanycyte, it is possible to pre-incubate the slices for 20 min with a gap junction inhibitor such as carbenoxolone (50 μM).6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6],7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]\nWhole-cell patch clamp of a POMC neuron.\nIn the \"membrane test\", choose the analog output that corresponds to the headstage chosen to patch the neuron.\nCarry out the steps from 7c to 7k previously described. For step 7g, clamp the cell at −60 mV instead of −80 mV.\nUsing a gap-free protocol, co-record the spontaneous activity of the tanycyte and the neuron in current-clamp mode.\nDo not inject any current.\nAfter a period of stabilization and baseline recording, apply the different conditions foreseen in the experimental protocol to answer the scientific question. Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.11].\nNote: As tanycytes, like all other glial cells, are non-excitable cells that do not generate action potentials, the current-clamp plot helps to ensure that the tanycyte is not lost during recording from the neuron."
