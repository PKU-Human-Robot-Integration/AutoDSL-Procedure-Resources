    "At the benchEuthanize the mouse by CO2 asphyxiation, following guidelines approved by your Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Sterilize the skin of the abdomen with 70% ethanol and open it.Remove the colon and/or 7-8 cm of the small intestine (from the cecum to the stomach) and place separately in Petri dishes filled with ice-cold HBSS/antibiotics (Figure 1). Note: It is better to avoid cell isolation from the colon and small intestine together as they need different incubation times in the digestion solution.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160912/20160912000149_5503.jpgFigure 1. Dissection of the mouse intestine. A. The skin is removed and the abdomen is exposed. B. The peritoneum is carefully opened to expose the intestine. C. The intestine is removed from the cavity to expose the stomach and the anus (indicated by arrows). D. The intestine is carefully removed from the anus to the stomach. The colon and small intestine are removed and placed in separate Petri dishes. Intestinal parts are indicated.Wash the intestinal parts repeatedly by flushing with HBSS/antibiotics using a 10 ml syringe equipped with a 21-gauge needle (Figure 2A). Place the tissue on a pre-wet paper and remove fat and adherent connective tissue (Figure 2B). Cut the intestinal tissue longitudinally and place in 10 ml ice-cold HBSS/antibiotics in a falcon tube per mouse on ice (Figure 2C).Notes: Intestinal tissue is sensitive and the duration of this step should be as short as possible. Each mouse tissue should be prepared separately and the tissue should then be placed on ice. If you need to pause the protocol in this step, although not recommended, place all tissues on ice. For the small intestine, it is better to also remove Peyer’s patches (Figure 2B).Using blunt ended needles in this step might be more convenient for less experienced users.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160912/20160912000328_5949.jpgFigure 2.",
    "Representative images of the steps for the preparation of the intestine. A. Flushing of the intestine. B. Removal of fat and connective tissue with the help of forceps. Peyer’s Patches are indicated with arrows. C. Longitudinal opening of the intestinal tissue.In the cell culture hoodWash colon or small intestine with ice-cold HBSS/antibiotics (~10 ml) at least 3 times by vigorously shaking the tube, removing the supernatant and adding new HBSS/antibiotics each time.Notes: The supernatant should be clear before you move to the next step.Removal of the supernatant can be easier if you use the sterile transfer pipettes. Place the tissue in a Petri dish and cut the tissue at 0.5-1 cm pieces with the help of scissors and forceps.Note: Scissors and forceps can be sterilized before inserting in the cell culture hood. Alternatively, scissors and forceps can be sprayed with 70% ethanol before use. They can be kept in 70% ethanol and emerged in sterile water before manipulation of the intestine, or in-between samples.Wash the pieces once with ice-cold HBSS/antibiotics (~10 ml) with vigorous shaking and remove the supernatant.Add 10 ml pre-warmed HBSS/EDTA/DTT solution and incubate for 20 min, at 37 °C, in a shaking water-bath (~200 rpm) to remove intestinal epithelial cells (both for the colon and small intestine).Wash the intestinal pieces at least 3 times with HBSS/antibiotics (it can be at room temperature now) by vigorously shaking the tubes for ~15 sec, removing the supernatant and adding new HBSS/antibiotics each time. After the last wash the supernatant should no longer be cloudy. Decant through a cell strainer (70 μm) to remove all liquid and place in a new Falcon tube. Note: EDTA can inhibit collagenase, so it has to be removed completely.",
    "Add 10 ml digestion solution and incubate for 1 h (colon) or 30-40 min (small intestine), at 37 °C, in a shaking water-bath (~200 rpm).Note: You should see the supernatant become cloudy and the tissue more transparent but not completely dissolved (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160912/20160912000555_0791.jpgFigure 3. Intestinal tissue before and after enzymatic digestion. The arrow indicates the presence of some intact tissue after enzymatic digestion.Shake vigorously and place supernatant in a new Falcon tube. Optional: You can pass the supernatant through a cell strainer (70 μm).Centrifuge at 280 x g for 10 min at room temperature.Resuspend the cell pellet in 5-6 ml DMEM medium + amphotericin B (2.5 μg/ml) and place in a 25 cm2 flask per mouse. Important: After 2-3 h you can notice cells adhering to the bottom of the flasks (Figure 4A). Change the medium at this point or the next day by removing the supernatant and adding new medium to reduce chances of contamination.Watch out daily for signs of bacterial contamination and feed every 2-3 days. Usually, at 4-5 days cells are confluent and can be passaged to a 75 cm2 flask (Figure 4B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160912/20160912000842_2490.jpgFigure 4. Representative images from IMCs in cell culture after plating (A) and at passage 2 (P2) (B). In (A) selected cells that have attached to the flask are indicated by arrows (Magnification lens 10x).Passaging of cells can be done by washing the cells twice with 10 ml of 1x PBS (diluted 10x PBS to 1x with H2O) each time and adding trypsin/EDTA (1 ml for a 25 cm2 flask). Incubation with trypsin/EDTA for 5 min, at room temperature should be enough for cells to detach. DMEM medium is then added to inactivate trypsin and cells are split at a 1:2 ratio.",
    "After the first passage, cells are usually passaged every 3-6 days in a split ratio 1:2 (always split when the cells are almost 100% confluent). Feed every 2-3 days. At passages 1 and 2, amphotericin B is added at 0.25 μg/ml and at passage 3 it is omitted. At passage 3, check cells with FACS analysis for their purity. At this stage, cultures are normally CD45 (< 3-4%), therefore negative for hematopoietic cells, and can be used in subsequent experiments. Vimentin, an intracellular cytoskeleton protein, can be used as a positive marker and should stain > 90% of the cells (See example of flow cytometry analysis in Figure 5 and FACS staining details under “Notes” section). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160912/20160912001003_2288.jpgFigure 5. Representative FACS analysis of isolated IMCs at passage 3 (P3)Try to use isolated IMCs between passages 3-5 and don’t keep them more than one month or if you notice changes in their morphology. One 175 cm2 flask usually yields 3-6 x 106 cells.Cells can be used for several functional and biochemical assays. Plating cell concentration to reach ~80% confluence the next day is as follows:96-well plate: 2 x 104 per well24-well plate: 8 x 104 per well6-well plate: 2.5 x 104 per well100 mm plate: 1.6 x 106 per plate"
