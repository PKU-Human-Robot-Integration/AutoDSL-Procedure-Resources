    "The experimental protocols and animal husbandry were conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines.\n1. Materials\nFind a complete list of the materials used to implement the method in the Table of Materials. Use Figure 1 and seek expert advice to construct an inverted T-shaped table, observation cages, and cage dividers. Follow the safety indications for the use of sharp tools and potentially dangerous materials.\nMake an inverted T-shaped table by gluing two rail-like wooden bars (45 cm length, separated 0.6 cm from each other) onto the top and in the middle of a piece of wood (100 cm x 45 cm x 1.5 cm). Then, place a second piece of wood (50 cm x 45 cm x 0.6 cm) vertically between the rail-like bars. Ensure that this second piece of wood prevents the pair of rats on one side from seeing the other pair on the opposite side (Figure 1).\nUse glass and acrylic to create eight observation cages. Ensure that each cage (19 cm wide, 19 cm long, 10 cm high, 3 mm thick) has 24 equidistant holes (5 mm diameter) arranged in three rows in the middle of one of its sides. Make this side of acrylic (3 mm thick) and shorten the height of the opposite side by 0.7 cm to allow the rat to breathe.\n\t\nMake sure each observation cage has a sliding lid made of acrylic to prevent the rat from rearing and distracting itself during the 60 min observation period.\nMake four dividers out of acrylic (19 cm wide, 30 cm high, 3 mm thick). Drill 24 holes (5 mm diameter) that match those in the observation cages, each in one clear divider and one opaque divider.",
    "Prepare data sheets in advance to record the occurrence of yawns. Include, in the heading of each data sheet, the name of the observer, experimental condition (i.e., familiar or unfamiliar rats), relevant test situation (OC, VC, VOC, NVOC), the date, and initial and final times of the observation. Divide the rest of the data sheet into two columns, each with the number of the rat written in the upper part, to record the yawning behavior of the rats.\n2. Procedure\nHouse 144 male rats in groups of four in plastic cages (home cages) from weaning until they reach 2.5 months in age. Do not use female rats, because they tend to show greater variation in behavior due to hormonal cycles, which may be confused with the effects of the test situation. Make sure that the rats in each cage are not siblings.\n\tNOTE: It might be difficult to obtain all the rats together. In that case, create blocks of at least 8 familiar rats and 8 unfamiliar rats so that every test situation is represented once in each experimental condition30.\nTo identify the rats, mark them with symbolic numbers on the tails using a commercial marker. For example, represent the numbers 1 to 4 by combining dots and lines (e.g. ,one dot for number 1 and one line for number 4). Identify familiar and unfamiliar rats using different colors.\n\tNOTE: Handle the rats following safety directions provided by animal facility staff, and comply with recommendations concerning the correct use of laboratory animals at the institution where experiments will be performed.",
    "Randomly choose which home cages will house the group of familiar rats and which will house the unfamiliar group. For example, suppose there are 16 available rats living in four home cages: number the home cages 1 to 4, then use R (download it at http://cran.r-project.org/) as follows [after the prompt (>)]:\n\t> sample(4,4)\n\t[1] 4 3 2 1\n\t\nGroup the familiar (or unfamiliar) rats in home cages 4 and 3, and group the unfamiliar (or familiar) rats in home cages 2 and 1. Make sure the animal facility staff maintains the identity of each cage and handles the rats in the same manner as all other rats in the animal facility.\nUse the R program again and randomly choose rats to form each pair in each experimental condition. Ensure that the rats in each pair of familiar rats originate from the same home cage, and ensure that the opposite is true for the pairs in the unfamiliar group. Randomly choose pairs of rats for each test situation in each experimental condition.\nPerform two test sessions per day with two of the eight possible test situations (four for each familiar and unfamiliar rats) per test session (i.e., 60 min observation period). Conduct the two test sessions consecutively within 3 h.\n\tNOTE: Make sure to conduct all test sessions (four pairs of rats per day) either in the morning or afternoon to avoid any confounding factors. Run a complete replicate (eight test situations) of the experiment over two consecutive days.\n\t\nMake sure to use the test situations in a random sequence for each replicate of the experiment. For example, use numbers 1 to 8 to identify each test situation, then use R as follows:\n\t\t>sample(8,8)\n\t\t[1] ​8 7 4 6 5 1 2 3",
    "Allocate test situations 8 and 7 to test session 1, test situations 4 and 6 to test session 2, and so on. Then, randomly choose the side of the inverted T-shaped table where each pair of rats (test situation) will be placed.\nRepeat the same procedure (steps 2.3 to 2.4.2) for a second replicate (i.e., block) of the experiment.\n\tNOTE: If the aim of the study is to test the effects of a social condition (i.e., two interacting rats) on yawning frequency, use one rat placed in an observation cage next to an empty observation cage as a control for each of the four test situations. Perform this experiment 2x for each test situation for a control group of eight rats.\nSet up the test session by transferring the first four rats from the animal facility to the observation room, where they will remain for 15 min to acclimate to the novel environment. Transport the rats in individual cages and keep them separated from each other during transportation and in the observation room.\n\tNOTE: Follow the safety directions for transporting animals provided by the animal facility staff and use the indicated clothes to work with animals in the laboratory. The rats will not have access to food and water while they are in the observation room.\nAfter the acclimatization period has passed, place the inverted T-shaped table on a larger rectangular table. Make sure there is a ceiling lamp that sufficiently lights the room when making observations.\nPut filter paper on the bottom of each observation cage and place the cages in pairs on each side of the inverted T-shaped table. Position the corresponding divider in between each pair of cages.",
    "NOTE: The filter paper makes it easier to clean the cages and provides a rough surface on which the rats can move without slipping.\nStrategically place two digital camcorders such that each records the yawning behavior of each pair of rats. Make sure the camcorders are safely fixed to tripods and correctly orientated to the observation cages. Connect the camcorders to a desktop computer to simultaneously monitor the behavior of the rats.\n\tNOTE: Store the digital information on flash drives to permanently archive the experimental sessions. Use flash drives with a high storage capacity.\nFollowing the acclimatization period, place the rats in the observation cages according to the allocation previously determined. Set the automatic focus of the camcorder and start the video recording simultaneously with a stopwatch. Stop the video recording at the end of the 60 min observation period.\n\tNOTE: While the experimenters may be outside of the room during the test session and observing remotely, it is recommended that one person is in the observation room (as far away as possible from the experimental setting) while monitoring the behavior of the rats to ensure that the test session proceeds without interruption.\nWhen the observation is over, return the rats to their home cages in the animal facility. Ask the animal facility staff to ensure that the rats have access to food and water again. Thoroughly clean the observation cages using a nontoxic detergent and prepare the experimental set-up to perform the second and final test sessions of the day.\n\tNOTE: Clean the wood to remove any scents left by the rats when placed in the observation cages, which could affect the behavior of the next pair of rats tested.",
    "Train one to two volunteers partially blind to the assigned treatments to identify and record yawning using an all-occurrence sampling method. Make sure the observers use the definition of yawning described in the introduction section.\nPlay back and project each video on a computer screen using any standard playback system. Ask the observer to view each video and observe and record yawning behavior using the previously prepared data sheets, then allow him/her to review the videos at slower speeds to enhance the ability to observe and measure yawning.\n\t\nAsk the observers to score yawning using a notation system similar to the following: use vertical lines with the minute written as a superscript to represent the occurrence of a yawn (e.g., |3 ||6 |9, indicating one yawn at minute 3, two yawns at minute 6, and one yawn at minute 9). Score yawning as a sequence (e.g.,1.2, 2.2, 3.2, 5.0, 5.8) to record it with greater precision (minutes rounded to one decimal place).\nAlternatively, directly input data from the videos into a computer using standard data collection programs. Make sure the observer is acquainted with such programs.\n\t\tNOTE: If necessary, allow the observer to view each video in more than one session. Ensure that one observer views all the videos corresponding to one block of experiments. If two different observers viewed these videos, there may be a risk that differences in their abilities to observe and record yawning will confound the effects of the test situations. It is important to score the intra-observer reliability between different observers on 10%-20% of the videos to ensure that yawning is annotated in the same way.\n3. Data processing",
    "Transcribe the temporal sequence of yawns in each rat from the data sheets to a spreadsheet. Ensure there is one column for each rat with a short heading (e.g., fr1.l and fr1.r to indicate the first pair of familiar rats on the left and right sides, respectively). Ensure that all columns are the same length by filling the empty cells with either 0 or NA (see below).\n\tNOTE: Use the general guide provided as a supplementary document[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59289/Supplemental_Material.zip] to fully understand the following steps to process the data, measure contagious yawning, and obtain contagious yawning curves.\n\t\nIf yawning was recorded to the nearest minute, type in the number of yawns at each relevant minute and use 0 (no yawn) to fill in the cells when no yawn occurred in a given minute. Save the worksheet as a text file (.txt).\nIf yawning was recorded to the nearest decimal of a minute, type in the sequence top down and use \"NA\" to fill in the empty spaces of columns (rats) in which the numbers of yawns (rows) is lower than that of the column with the maximum number (rows) of yawns recorded for a rat. Save the worksheet as a text file (.txt).\n\t\tNOTE: As R has the ability to work with empty cells, the worksheet can be saved with columns of different lengths. Use the help options provided by R to handle missing data.\nInitiate R. Import the data from the file in which they were previously located.\nSave the program codes with the extension \".R\" (provided as supplementary material[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59289/Supplemental_Material.zip]), then download the specific program code (see general guide) depending on whether yawns were recorded as integers or fractional numbers. Run the program for each pair of rats and desired number of time frames.",
    "Run the program again, now using a random distribution of the number of yawns from each rat (see general guide). Follow the same steps (steps 3.3 to 3.3.1) for all experimental conditions (i.e., familiar and unfamiliar rats) and/or all the test situations. Proceed as indicated in the general guide and export the results to Excel.\n\t\tNOTE: Instead of importing a previously saved program, as suggested above using a text editor, copy and directly paste the program into R's workspace.\nTo create yawn contagion curves, use the data previously saved in an spreadsheet. Subtract the non-contagion rates from the contagion rates for each pair of rats, time window, and test situation. Separate the analyses of the observed data and artificial (randomly distributed) data.\n\t\nNext, calculate confidence intervals (CI) for each time window and test situation using a bootstrap procedure (see the general guide). Separate the analyses for familiar and unfamiliar rats. Then, combine the artificial data from the four test situations for each experimental condition and calculate the CI for each time window using a bootstrap procedure.\nNext, create plots for each test situation and experimental condition (see Figure 2 and Figure 3). Finally, perform a multiple regression analysis to compare the intensity of yawn contagion between test situations (see below).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
