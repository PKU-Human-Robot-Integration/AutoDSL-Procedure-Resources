    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe Schematic diagram of the animal model is shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2313-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. The schematic diagram for the mouse model\nFirst, the mice were pretreated with the antibiotic cocktail for 5 days to eliminate the autochthonous microbiota and then given daily bacterial strains gavage for 5 days. The mice were treated with DSS for 7 days on day 0. During this period, the mice were given daily bacterial strains gavage and LPS challenge.\nPreparation of male mice for gavage\nTiming: 6 days\nCritical: 1. 6–8 weeks old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) male mice must be kept in cages for three days to adapt to the new environment. 2. Mice need to be pre-treated with an oral mixture of antibiotics for five days before bacterial gavage. 3. Gavage procedures for antibiotics and bacteria cultures are identical (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nThis section describes the process of clearing bacteria from the gut and how to measure the effect of clearing bacteria.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2313-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Oral gavage with antibiotics and bacteria\n(A) The gavage needle.\n(B) The diagram of oral gavage. Hold the skin on back, head and neck of the mouse to stabilize the body and keep the angle between the lower jaw and neck of the mouse at 180°to ensure that the esophagus is unobstructed. First, inject the needle from the corner of the mouse’s mouth. When it passes through the throat, the resistance disappears obviously. Keep the gavage needle moving in parallel with the esophagus, and gently adjust the direction to pass in case of obstruction.\nFrom day -11 to day -7.\nOn the first day of the model, in the animal facility, weigh male mice to be included in the model and randomly assign the animals into two groups: the control and treatment group.",
    "Critical: The two groups of mice are ensured to have similar activity and body weight.\nCollect at least 150 mg of feces into 1.5 mL sterile microtubes to evaluate the effect of antibiotic treatment and store them in a −80°C refrigerator.\nNote: These stool samples can be processed with samples collected later.\nCritical: 1. When collecting samples, drain mouse urine to avoid contamination of feces by urine. 2. Place the microtubes with the collected feces on ice in time.\nAdd ampicillin (1 g/L), vancomycin (500 mg/L), neomycin (1 g/L) and metronidazole (1 g/L) (ABX) to sterile drinking water.\nNote: ABX is used to clear most the intestinal bacteria (Kirkland et al.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nNote: Metronidazole is difficult to dissolve in sterile water and should be shaken vigorously for about 5 min to help dissolve.\nNote: The ABX is stable for two weeks at 20°C–24°C.\nOrally gavage the mice with ABX.\nNote: Normally, mice drink very little ABX, so they need to be gavaged to ensure adequate ABX into the intestine.\nGrab and fix the mouse to straighten its head and neck.\nInsert the gavage needle (8#) parallel to the lower jaw until the throat (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nVerticalize the needle and insert it along the esophagus without any obstruction, until almost the whole needle is inserted (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nNote: If there a is blockage, adjust the needle direction until smooth insertion.\nInject 500 μL of the ABX solution slowly into the esophagus without liquid overflowing from the mouth and causing choking.\nNote: Gavage needles need to be immersed in 75% ethanol for sterilization after daily use.\nOn day -6.\nCollect at least 150 mg of feces into 1.5 mL sterile microtubes.\nReplace the ABX solution with sterile water.",
    "Note: This step aims to reduce the concentration of ABX in the intestinal so that facultative anaerobe bacteria can colonize.\nUse the Stool DNA Kit to extract microbial genomic DNA from two batches of feces samples according to the manufacturer’s protocols[href=https://www.omegabiotek.com/product/e-z-n-a-stool-dna-kit/], and then determine the amount of DNA.\nCalculate the fecal DNA concentration of mice treated with ABX for five days or without (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2313-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Fecal DNA concentration of mice before and after treatment with ABX for five days\nData are represented as mean ± SEM, Mann-Whitney test.\nPretreated with a single bacterial strain\nTiming: 5 days\nThis section describes the process of pretreatment with a single strain.\nFrom day -5 to day -1.\nOrally gavage the mice with 1 × 109 CFU of bacteria in 200 μL PBS. Gavage procedure for bacteria is identical to that described in step 1.\nNote: Mice in the control group are gavaged with 200 μL PBS containing 0.1% L-cysteine.\nInject 200 mL of bacteria Slowly into the esophagus without liquid overflowed from the mouth and choking.\nInduction of colitis by DSS (dextran sulfate sodium) and LPS\nTiming: 7 days\nThis section describes how to treat mice with a single strain during colitis caused by DSS and LPS.\nOn day 0.\nRecord the weight of mice.\nAdd 3% DSS to the drinking water of the mice to cause a mouse experimental model of acute colitis.\nNote: 3% DSS solution can be stored at 20°C–24°C for 3–4 days.\nOrally gavage the mice with 1 × 109 CFU of bacterial strain and LPS (8 mg/kg body weight).",
    "Note: Administration of DSS solutions to mice induced colitis which resembled mucosal pathology of human ulcerative colitis.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] Colitis induced experimentally by DSS is a common model system to study etiology of inflammatory bowel disease. High concentrations of DSS can induce acute colitis.\nFrom day 1 to day 6 troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1], 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3], 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nRecord the weight of mice every day, analyze the body weight change according to the weight at day 0. Body weight loss was scored as follows: 0 (<2%), 1 (2%–5%), 2(5%–10%), 3 (10%–15%), 4 (>15%).5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nObserve the stool consistency and scored as follows: 0, normal; 1, mild soft stools; 2, very soft stools; 3, watery stools. Stool bleeding was scored as follows: 0, normal; 1, brown color; 2, reddish color; 3, bloody stool.\nCalculate disease activity index (DAI).\nNote: DAI is the sum of stool consistence score, stool bleeding score and body weight loss score. DAI is a measure of the severity of colitis.\nOrally gavage the mice with bacteria and LPS every day.\nSupplement 3% DSS solution promptly to ensure that mice get it from day 1 to day 6.\nNote: Broad-spectrum antibiotics (ABX) relieve colitis by reducing bacterial burden.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] After ABX pretreatment, DSS-induced colitis was mild in this model. So LPS is used to aggravate colitis in the absence of commensal bacteria.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]\nMouse dissection and harvesting colons\nTiming: 1 day\nThis section describes how to harvest colons and perform tissue fixation.\nOn day 7.\nRecord the weight and the stool score and calculate DAI (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2313-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Mice treated with DSS, LPS, and single bacterial strain\n(A) The body weight change during mice treated with DSS plus daily single bacterial strain gavage and LPS challenge.",
    "(B) The disease activity index change during mice treated with DSS plus daily single bacterial strain gavage and LPS challenge. Data are represented as mean ± SEM, two-way ANOVA.\nPerform cervical dislocation to euthanize and prepare for dissection.\nSoak the surface of the body in 70% vol/vol ethanol and wipe it off with paper.\nUse dissection scissors to open the abdominal cavity and remove the colon intact (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2313-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Sacrifice of mice\n(A) Cut the abdominal skin of the mice to expose the peritoneum.\n(B) Open the abdominal cavity and separate the small intestine and ileocecum at their junction. Isolate the ileocecum and colon and cut them at the anus.\nNote: The intact colon includes the cecum to the distal colon.\nPhotographed all colons against a blue background and measured for length (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2313-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. Comparison of colon length between treatment group and control group after DSS treatment\n(A) The appearance of the colon and spleen.\n(B) Colon length analysis. Data are represented as mean ± SEM, Mann-Whitney test.\nUsing a scissor, cut no less than 4 mm segments from a distal part of colon and then the segments of the distal part of colon is flushed with PBS using a gavage needle, doused in 4% paraformaldehyde at 20°C–24°C for fixation.\nPause point: Colon tissue should be fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1–2 days.\nCritical: 1. After around day 5–7 oral DSS, the feces may be difficult to observe because of the severe colitis. 2. Replenish DSS solution in time. 3. Dissection should be gentle and precise so as not to damage the colon. 4. Take a picture as quickly as possible to keep the tissue fresh.\nPreparation of colons for cross-sectional hematoxylin-eosin staining\nTiming: 1 day",
    "This section describes the dewaxing, embedding, and sectioning of intestinal tissue.\nOn day 8 troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nPreheat a dry oven to 70°C.\nAfter 24 h at 20°C–24°C, discard the PFA and transfer the tissue to the embedding box. Mark with a pencil.\nDehydrate specimens in graded ethanol solutions at 20°C–24°C.\nPlace rack of specimens in 70% ethanol for 60 min.\nTransfer rack of specimens to 85% ethanol for 40 min.\nTransfer rack of specimens to 95% ethanol for 60 min.\nTransfer rack of specimens to fresh 95% ethanol for 40 min.\nIncubate rack of specimens for 60 min in 100% ethanol.\nTransfer rack of specimens to fresh 100% ethanol for 40 min.\nPlace rack of specimens in xylene for 50 min and then flesh xylene for 50 min.\nCompletely immerse the colon tissue in liquid wax in a regulated oven at 60°C for 30 min and then fresh wax for 60 min.\nNote: Fresh xylenes, graded ethanol solutions and liquid wax should be replaced every two months to ensure the effect of wax immersion.\nNote: The liquid wax should remain clear. If there is a solidified wax, it should be timely dissolved by heating.\nCarefully embedded the intestinal specimens in paraffin. Cut tissue sections on a microtome at 5-μm thickness.\nPause point: The tissue in the wax block can be preserved for years.\nNote: The hardness of the wax is selected based on the tissue type. The higher the tissue hardness, the higher the melting point of the wax should be. For general purposes (Such as embedding colon tissue), paraffin wax with a melting point of about 54°C–57°C is recommended.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]\nUse tweezers to pick up the sections and transfer to the 45°C water bath, and then take the floating sections using slides.",
    "Melt paraffin to drive off any residual water trapped behind sections.\nPlace slides in a xylene compatible, non-metal slide rack.\nBake the rack of slides in a 60°C oven for at least 1 h.\nCritical: 1. Markers whose writing is dissolved in organic solvents cannot be used for marking the embedding box. Pencil is recommended. 2. Deparaffinization and subsequent staining procedures should be carried out in the fume hood. 3. Make sure graded ethanol solutions and xylene completely submerges the tissue when dehydration.\nHematoxylin-eosin staining of intestinal tissue\nTiming: 2–4 h\nThis section describes the process of hematoxylin-eosin staining, mounting and how to assess histopathological scores.\nOn day 9 troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nDissolve surrounding and infiltrating paraffin from the sections. Perform all steps at 20°C–24°C.\nPlace rack of slides in xylene for 10 min.\nTransfer rack of slides to fresh xylene for 8 min.\nClear the xylene from slides at 20°C–24°C.\nPlace rack of slides in 100% ethanol for 2 min.\nTransfer rack of slides to fresh 100% ethanol, and incubate for 1 min.\nDehydrate slides in three changes of ethanol at 20°C–24°C.\nTransfer slide rack to 95% ethanol and incubate 1 min.\nTransfer slide rack to 85% ethanol and incubate 1 min.\nTransfer slide rack to 70% ethanol and incubate 1 min.\nRinse slides in running tap water for 30 s.\nNote: Xylene and ethanol used for staining can be reused. In order to take a clear image, we recommend replacing these solutions after processing every 100 slides.\nTransfer the slides to a staining jar with hematoxylin to completely cover tissue section and incubate for 6 min to stain nuclei.\nRinse slides in running tap water to remove excess stain.\nTransfer the slides to a staining jar with Eosin solution and incubate for 30 s.",
    "Note: Replace fresh hematoxylin and Eosin solution after every batch of 100 slides.\nRinse the slides in running tap water till the water is clear.\nSuccessively transfer the slides into staining jars.\n70% ethanol for 2 s.\n85% ethanol for 4 s.\n95% ethanol for 20 s.\n100% ethanol, two changes of 1 min each.\nXylene for 2 min twice.\nMount coverslips to the slides with a resinous mounting medium.\nObserve (and photograph if necessary) H&E staining slides with an optical microscope to assess histopathological scores (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2313-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10. The severity of tissue inflammation assessment by H&E staining\n(A and B) Representative images of H&E staining of colon tissue in the control group and treatment group.\n(C) Histopathological scores are compared between the two groups. Data are represented as mean ± SEM, Mann-Whitney test.\nNote: The severity of inflammation was assessed in seven parameters: (A) extent of inflammation (score of 0–4), (B) extent of crypt damage (score of 0–4), (C) infiltration of neutrophils and lymphocytes (score of 0–3), (D) submucosal edema (score of 0–3), (E) loss of goblet cells (score of 0–3), (F) reactive epithelial hyperplasia (score of 0–3), (G) crypt abscesses (score of 0–2).5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5],9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]"
