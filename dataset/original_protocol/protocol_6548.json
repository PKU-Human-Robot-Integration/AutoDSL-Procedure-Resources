    "The design and construction of a target gene tagged according to the FENIX system could be divided into the following 4 steps (A to D), summarized in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200715/20200715123156_7783.jpgFigure 1. Rationale and construction of the FENIX system for one-step cloning and tagging of individual target proteins. The gene encoding the target polypeptide (gene of interest, goi) is amplified by PCR with specific oligonucleotides that include NheI and BsrGI restriction sites. The resulting amplicon can be directly cloned into plasmid pFENIX·gfp* (which contains a nia/ssrA tagged version of the green fluorescent protein, see Table 1 and Supplementary file[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20200706/3688 Supplementary pFENIX gfp sequence.docx]) upon digestion with these two restriction enzymes. The NheI restriction site is located between the RBS and the ATG of gfp gene so the N-terminal region of goi will keep without any modification, and the C-terminal region will contain eight extra bp (in red) between goi and nia sequences, translated as XYK amino acids (X could be L, M or V amino acid depending on the last bp of the goi). After ligation, the new plasmid pFENIX·goi is transformed into competent E. coli DH10B cells. In all pFENIX plasmids, the expression of the nia/ssrA-tagged variant of the goi depends on the constitutive PtetA promoter.Table 1. Bacterial strains and plasmidsimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200715/20200715123230_8164.png Construction of pFENIX plasmids for one-step cloning and tagging of individual target proteinsSelect the gene encoding the target polypeptide (gene of interest, goi).Design specific oligonucleotides to amplify the goi, including NheI (5'-GCTAGC-3') and BsrGI (5'-TGTACA-3') restriction sites in the 5' and 3' termini, respectively.Set up a 100-μl PCR reaction using proof-reading Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega). Standard reaction conditions can be used as described in the provider manual’s for Pfu DNA polymerase.",
    "In most cases, thermal cycling conditions are as follows: after heating at 98 °C for 5 min, set 30 cycles of 98 °C for 30 s (denaturation), 57 °C for 30 s (annealing, temperature varies depending on the actual Tm of the oligonucleotides used), and 72 °C for 1 min (elongation, time varies depending on the size of the goi to be amplified, typically 2 min/kb).Purify the PCR product by using the Gene-Clean Turbo kit (Q-BIOgene).Note: When the PCR amplification yields non-specific bands, the target product is cut from an agarose gel after electrophoresis by loading the total volume of PCR and the amplicon is gel-purified by means of the Gene-Clean Turbo kit. Digest plasmid pFENIX and the PCR product of the goi with the restriction enzymes NheI and BsrGI, and then purify both DNA fragments using the Gene-Clean Turbo kit.Clone the goi in the pFENIX backbone by the T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs), adding a goi concentration 5-10 times higher than the plasmid pFENIX in a final volume of 20 μl.Cell transformation with the pFENIX-goi plasmidKeep competent E. coli DH10B cells on ice. This protocol has been carried out with strain DH10B taking into account its high competence skills, but any E. coli strain routinely used for cloning (e.g., DH5α) could be likewise used.Take the 20-μl ligation mixture from the step before and add it into 0.1 ml of the cell suspension of competent E. coli DH10B (see Recipes), and then incubate the mixture on ice for 30 min.Heat-shock the cells at 42 °C for 45 s, and immediately add 0.9 ml of LB broth to the mixture.Incubate 1 ml of the suspension of E. coli DH10B transformants at 37 °C for 60 min.Spread 0.1 ml and/or the rest of the suspension of E.",
    "coli DH10B transformants onto LB agar plates with 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and then incubate the plates at 37 °C overnight.Isolate a transformant of E. coli DH10B harboring the cloned candidates on the LB agar with 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol.Inoculate a single colony into 10 ml of LB broth containing 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol in a 50-ml conical tube, and incubate the culture in an orbital shaker at 37 °C with shaking (180 rpm) overnight.Isolate the plasmid from the transformant cells of 10 ml overnight culture by means of the High-Pure plasmid isolation kit (Roche).Check the DNA sequence of the tagged goi cloned into the pFENIX plasmid with an ABI Prism 377 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.), using the universal primers R24 (5'-AGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGA-3') and F24 (5'-CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3').Compare the sequence of the clones with that of the reference sequence to ensure the absence of mutations. An alignment software such as Bioedit or ApE-A could be used.Long-term storage of bacterial strains transformed with these plasmids is routinely done as 15% glycerol stocks according to well-established procedures (Sambrook and Russell, 2001).Electroporation of pFENIX recombinants with the plasmid encoding the NIa proteaseIncubate a 20-ml culture of E. coli DH10B harboring plasmid pFENIX·goi in LB medium overnight at 37 °C with shaking (180 rpm) in an orbital shaker.Distribute the whole culture in a 50-ml sterile conical tube and centrifuge at 2,300 x g and 4°C for 10 min.Remove supernatant, resuspend the pellet gently in 10-ml of cold sterile water (4 °C) and centrifuge at 2,300 x g and 4 °C for 10 min.Discard supernatant, add 1 ml of sterile cold water, resuspend the pellet and transfer the suspension to a 2-ml microcentrifuge tube.Centrifuge at 3,800 x g and 4 °C for 5 min. Repeat this step 2 times.",
    "Note: The cells are ready to be electroporated when they form a very soft and loose pellet after the centrifugation with cold water. Dispose of the supernatant and add 300 μl of cold sterile water, resuspend and distribute 100 μl of the resulting suspension into 2-mm gap width electroporation cuvettes.Add 200 ng of the plasmid pS238·NIa to the electroporation cuvette containing 100 μl of the suspension of E. coli DH10B cells harboring the plasmid pFENIX·goi, mix gently and proceed to electroporate in an electroporator (Gene Pulser, Bio-Rad).Note: The parameters of electroporation are resistance, 200 Ω; capacitance, 25 µF; and voltage, 2.5 kV. Add 0.9 ml of LB medium to the cell suspension and incubate for 1 h at 37 °C with shaking (180 rpm) in an orbital shaker.Plate the whole culture onto LB medium plates added with 30 µg/ml chloramphenicol and 50 μg/ml kanamycin.Streak a few colonies and check for the presence of both plasmid pFENIX·goi and pS238·NIa in the transformant bacteria by plasmid extraction (High-Pure plasmid isolation kit, Roche).Digest the mixture of both plasmids extracted with SpeI (5'-ACTAGT-3') and run an agarose gel electrophoresis to check the relevant sizes. Expect a band of approximately 3.6 kb plus the size of the corresponding goi with pFENIX·goi, and a band of approximately 5.8 kb of the empty pS238·NIa vector.Protocol for activation of the protease NIa in the FENIX native system with GFP* (Figure 2)Select a single colony of the E.",
    "coli transformants harbouring the plasmids listed below (Table 1):pS238·NIa (negative control)pS341T·gfp (positive control)pSEVA238 and pFENIX·gfp* (control strain without the protease NIa)pS238·NIa and pFENIX·gfp* Individually inoculate the four recombinant strains in 50-ml conical tubes with 10 ml of LB medium containing 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol (for the positive control), 50 μg/ml kanamycin (for the negative control), or both antibiotics (for strains containing both plasmids).Incubate the pre-culture overnight at 37 °C with shaking (180 rpm).Inoculate 4 μl of each overnight pre-culture in a 96-well microtiter plate containing 200 μl of fresh LB medium per well, including 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol and/or 50 μg/ml kanamycin, and in presence or absence of 1 mM 3-methylbenzoate as the inducer of nia expression (in the case of strains harbouring the pFENIX·gfp* plasmid). Each experiment should be carried out in three independent wells as technical replicates.Incubate the 96-well microtiter plate at 37 °C with shaking in a plate reader during 24 h, till the stationary phase.Measure the OD600 and the GFP fluorescence in the plate reader at the endpoint of the growth curve (Figure 2). GFP is excited at 488 nm, the fluorescence signal is recovered at 511 nm, and it was used the bottom reading mode.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200715/20200715123317_9303.jpgFigure 2. Performance of the FENIX system with GFP fluorescence as the readout. A. Scheme of NIa and SsrA-dependent post-translational control of GFP with the FENIX system. The gene encoding the green fluorescence protein (GFP) is added with a synthetic, hybrid nia/ssrA tag, resulting in a tagged GFP variant in which the C-terminus displays the GESNVVVHQADER·AANDENYALAA amino acid sequence. The SsrA tag is directly recognized by the ClpXP and ClpAP proteases of the bacterial proteasome in vivo, thus degrading the protein.",
    "Upon action of the specific potyvirus NIa protease (the recognition site in the synthetic nia/ssrA tag is indicated with an inverted red triangle in the diagram), the SsrA tag is released and GFP can be accumulated, resulting in the appearance of GFP+ cells. B. Evaluation of the FENIX system in recombinant E. coli using GFP protein. Plasmid pFENIX·gfp*, which contain the nia/ssrA-tagged version of GFP (indicated with blue and orange strips in the first row of the table), were transformed into E. coli DH10B carrying either plasmid pS238·NIa or the empty pSEVA238 vector (indicated as + and −, respectively, in the second row of the table). The first two columns represent a negative and positive control, respectively, carried out with E. coli DH10B transformed either with the empty pFENIX vector (i.e., no GFP protein) or with a plasmid constitutively expressing the gene encoding gfp* (pS341T·gfp*, Table 1). Strains indicated in the next four columns contain the nia/ssrA-tagged GFP. These experiments were done in 96-well microtiter plates containing LB medium with the necessary antibiotics and additives (1 mM 3-methylbenzoate as the inducer of nia expression, as indicated in the third row of the table), and were inoculated with a culture of the corresponding strain previously grown in LB medium with the necessary antibiotics overnight. Cells were incubated at 37 °C with rotary agitation, and fluorescence and bacterial growth (expressed as the optical density measured at 600 nm, OD600) were recorded after 24 h. The specific (Sp) activity of the fluorescent proteins under study was calculated as the arbitrary fluorescence units (a.f.u.) normalized to the OD600. Each bar represents the mean value of the Sp activity ± standard deviation calculated from at least three independent experiments.",
