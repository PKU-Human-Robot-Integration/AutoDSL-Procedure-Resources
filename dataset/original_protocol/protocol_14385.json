    "The investigation is conducted according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institute of Health (NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996). In general, male wistar rats aged 3 to 4 months and with an average weight of 250 - 350 g are used for this protocol. One rat heart is sufficient for 20 culture dishes (1 mL per dish; inner diameter: 35 mm) with an approximate cell density of 1.5 x 104 cells/1000 mm2.\n1. Preparation of Media and Reagents\nCreatine-carnitine-taurine medium (CCT medium)\n\tNOTE: CCT medium is a complex medium based on medium 199 with the addition of creatine, carnitine, and taurine.\n\t\nPrepare 1 L of medium 199: add 3.6 g Hepes and mix for 1 h. Then add 655.5 mg creatine (5 mM), 395.4 mg carnitine (2 mM), and 625.5 mg taurine (5 mM). Carnitine and taurine change pH to <7. In order to inhibit the growth of any contaminating cells, e.g. endothelial cells or fibroblasts, add 10 µM cytosine β-D-arabinofuranoside to the medium. Adjust the pH with NaOH (2 mM) to 7.4 and sterile filter the medium. Store the CCT medium at 4 °C.\nPowell medium\nFor 1 L Powell medium, dissolve 6.43 g NaCl (110 mM) with 0.19 g KCl (2.5 mM), 0.16 g KH2PO4 (1.2 mM), 0.3 g MgSO4 7H2O (1.2 mM), 5.96 g Hepes (25 mM), and 1.98 g D(+)-Glucose monohydrate (10 mM) in Aqua sterile. Adjust pH with NaOH (2 M) to 7.4 and sterile filter the medium. Store Powell medium at 4 °C.\nCalcium chloride (CaCl2)\nPrepare a 100 mM CaCl2 solution (50 mL) and prepare aliquots containing 500 µL CaCl2. Freeze aliquots at -20 °C.\nPreparation of culture medium",
    "Prepare three cell culture mediums: pre-plating medium, plating medium, and washing medium. Use CCT medium as the basis for all three mediums (Table 1). Calculate CCT medium with 1 mL per culture dish. Therefore, prepare 20 mL CCT medium for 20 culture dishes (inner diameter: 35 mm).\nCell culture plates: Coat each cell culture plate (inner diameter: 35 mm) with 1 mL pre-plating medium. Store the coated plates at 37 °C overnight or for at least 2 h before using.\n2. Isolation of Adult Cardiomyocytes\nPreparation of Langendorff perfusion system\nHeat plating medium and washing medium to 37 °C. Defreeze a tube of 500 µL CaCl2 and weigh in 25 mg of collagenase.\nFlush the Langendorff perfusion system with aqua sterile, afterwards let Powell medium circulate the system for 5 min.\nFill the Langendorff perfusion system with 80 mL Powell medium without any air bubbles and gas the medium with 95% oxygen.\nPrepare a tube (50 mL) with 40 mL Powell medium, heat it to 37 °C, and gas it with 95% oxygen.\nPrepare a thread of about 25 cm in length for attaching the removed heart to the cannula.\nDegrease a razor blade with alcohol (70% by volume) and fasten it to the chopper. Clamp a plastic disc into the chopper.\nExtraction of heart\nAnesthetize a male wistar rat with 4% to 5% isoflurane and sacrifice it with cervical dislocation. Open the abdomen behind the costal arch with an abdominal shear and, with the same pair of scissors, cut through the diaphragm to open the thoracic cavity.\nRemove the heart, together with the lung and thymus, by cutting above the thymus highly cranial in the thoracic cavity. Transfer the material to ice-cold saline solution immediately.",
    "Remove the lung and thymus from the heart with a dissecting scissor (large) and by fixating the material with capsule forceps, transfer the latter to a new saline solution.\nIsolation\nRemove excess tissue, like residues of thymus, trachea, fat, and connective tissue from the heart using capsule forceps and a dissecting scissor (large or small). Uncover the aorta and sever it with a dissecting scissor (large or small) between the first and second branchial arch.\nStart the dripping of the Langendorff perfusion system. Place the heart on the cannula of the Langendorff perfusion system and fixate it first with a crocodile clamp and later with the prepared thread. Rinse the heart until it is free of blood.\nDissolve 25 mg Collagenase in 5 - 6 mL warm Powell medium and add 12.5 µL CaCl2 (30 µM).\nClose circulation by moving a glass funnel, which is connected with the Langendorff perfusion system, over the dripping heart and add the solved collagenase to the perfusion system. Start the perfusion for 25 min with a drop velocity of 1 drop per second.\n\t\tNOTE: During perfusion, the heart will swell and get a waxy appearance.\nStop the perfusion after 25 min and remove the heart from the Langendorff perfusion system. Remove the aorta, atria, and connective tissue from the heart and open the right and left ventricles.\nChop the heart two times at an angle of 90° (cutting width: 0.7 mm; velocity: 0.15 cm/s). Repeat this process manually with two scalpels for 10 s each side.\nTransfer 12 mL of the perfusion medium into a new tube (50 mL). Pour the cell slurry into this medium and digest cells for another five minutes at 37 °C. Mix the solution every minute.",
    "Filter the solution with the digested heart through a nylon mesh (200 µm) into a new tube (50 mL).\nCentrifuge the filtered solution at 29 x g for 3 min. Discard the supernatant and add 6 mL warm Powell medium including 12.5 µL CaCl2 (250 µM) to the cell pellet. Resuspend the pellet through smooth shaking movements. Centrifuge again at 29 x g for 2 min. Discard the supernatant and add 6 mL warm Powell medium substituted with 25 µL CaCl2 (500 µM). Dissolve the cell pellet through gentle shaking movements and add 12 mL warm Powell medium including 120 µL CaCl2 (1 mM). Centrifuge for a third time at 16 x g for 1 min. Again, remove the supernatant.\nMix the cell pellet with the pre-warmed plating medium.\nRemove pre-plating medium from culture plates. Transfer 1 mL plating medium, including the isolated cardiomyocytes, to each culture plate. Incubate fresh isolated cardiomyocytes at 37 °C for 1 h.\nRemove the plating medium from culture plates. Add 1 mL washing medium to each culture plate and store the plates at 37 °C up to six days without changing the medium.\nFor investigating the influence of different chemicals and treatments on ARVC, first refresh plating medium by washing medium and thereafter adding different chemicals.\n\t\tNOTE: Evaluation with light microscopy: With each cell preparation, 150 to 300 cardiomyocytes should be monitored per day by light microscopy. Subdivide all counted cardiomyocytes into groups according to their appearance (e.g., \"rod-shaped\", \"round down\", \"spreading\", and \"unusual appearance\"). The category \"spreading\" includes all cardiomyocytes with pseudopodia-like structures. \"Unusual appearance\" includes all ARVC with an irregular surface and no detectable intact cell membrane.\n3. Example Experiments\nFluorescence/Immunofluorescence staining of adult cardiomyocytes",
    "Analyze morphological and structural conversions of ARVC during cultivation by confocal laser microscopy. Use Phalloidin-TRITC to investigate F-actin structures in \"rod-shaped\", \"round down\", and \"spreading\" ARVC. Perform staining according to the manufacturer's protocol. An example for Phalloidin-TRITC staining is given in reference Nippert et al.11. With fluorescence/immunofluorescence staining, differences in the de- and re-differentiation of the contractile apparatus in cultivated adult cardiomyocytes between experimental treatments (e.g., with Swiprosin-1, ionomycin) can be investigated.\nReal-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)\nPerform qRT-PCR to investigate changes in the mRNA expression of different genes (e.g., OSM, Swiprosin-1, β-MHC) during cultivation of ARVC. For sufficient sample size, use larger culture dishes (inner diameter: 60 mm) with 2 mL volume. ARVC of five culture dishes yields one sample. Perform isolation of mRNA and transformation of cDNA according to the manufacturer's protocol.\nImmunoblot techniques\nPerform Western Blots to investigate changes in protein expression (e.g., for Swiprosin-1) during cultivation of ARVC. Use one culture dish (1 mL) per sample.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
