  "procedures": [
    "Colostrum samples were collected for 6 days after calving in the noon over the period July-August, from 28 Holstein dairy cows from Uluova Milk Trading Company in Çanakkale, Turkey, and deep-frozen. The samples collected on the same day were pooled according to the day of each sample and analyzed for their total protein, lactoferrin, and IgG concentrations. All samples were assayed in duplicate.\n1. Sample preparation\nMix 200 µL of bovine colostrum with 400 µL of dH2O to obtain a diluted sample for the analysis. Dilute all the samples accordingly.\nCentrifuge diluted and undiluted samples at 4 °C, 1000 x g for 30 min.\nSeparate the middle phase to an appropriately labeled new tube. Repeat step 1.2. to obtain clear middle phase. Store the whole middle phase and diluted samples at -20 °C, if not used immediately.\nUse the middle phase obtained from diluted samples for BCA, SDS-PAGE, and Lactoferrin assays. Collect the middle phase from undiluted samples for IgG assay.\nPrepare sample dilutions for each sample to ensure that the readings are within the standard curve range. Dilute each middle phase obtained from the diluted samples to 1:300 for BCA assay, and 1:30,000 for Lactoferrin assay, and dilute each middle phase obtained from undiluted samples to 1:400,000 for IgG assay.\n\tNOTE: Dilution factors are determined based on the absorbance value and standard curve.\n2. Determine the protein concentration using BCA protein assay kit\nPreparation of standards and reagents\nUse the reagents provided in the commercially available kit (see Table of Materials) to be used for the assay: BCA reagent A, containing sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, bicinchoninic acid, and sodium tartrate in 0.1 M sodium hydroxide. BCA reagent B contains 4% cupric sulfate. Albumin (BSA) standards, contains bovine serum albumin at 2.0 mg/mL in 0.9% saline and 0.05% sodium azide.",
    "Equilibrate all samples and protein standards to room temperature (RT).\nPrepare sufficient volumes of working reagent (WR) by mixing 50:1 ratio of reagent A:B. 200 µL of WR is required for each sample and standard.\nPrepare diluted albumin (BSA) standards according to the following dilution scheme (Table 1), that presents a working range between 20-2,000 µg/mL final BSA concentration.

Add 200 µL of the WR to each well-containing standard or sample. Mix the plate thoroughly on a plate shaker for 30 s.\nCover the plate with a plate sealer and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min. After incubation, allow the reactions to equilibrate to RT for around 10 min. Read each plate at 562 nm using a microplate reader with its associated software.\nGenerating standard curve and determining results\nRecord the absorbance values for the standards and samples. Please see Table 1 for the dilution series. Subtract absorbance values of the standard blank from each absorbance value of standards and sample. Average the duplicate readings for each standard and sample to estimate total protein concentration.\nConstruct a standard curve by plotting the corrected mean absorbance for each standard on the x-axis and concentration on the y-axis. Draw a linear curve with appropriate software capable of the four-parameter curve fit.",
    "Use the standard curve to determine the concentration of each sample by interpolating its response to the concentration.
