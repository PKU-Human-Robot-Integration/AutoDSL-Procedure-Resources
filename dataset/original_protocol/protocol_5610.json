    "Prepare genomic DNA from the donor E. coli strains (MG1655 wild-type or the ΔhslO deletion) from 5 ml overnight culture (in LB medium) using the GenElute Bacterial Genomic DNA kit following the manufacturer’s instruction.   Partially digest the genomic DNA (2 μg) with 0.05-0.2 units of BfuCI in a total volume of 50 μl for 10 min at 37 °C. Then heat inactive the enzyme.    Analyze digested products on 1% agarose gels (in TAE buffer) and make sure that fragment sizes ranging between 1 and 8 kb.   Gel purify fragmented genomic DNA with Gel Extraction Kit (some researchers prefer to separate DNA fragments into bins, for example 1-3 kb, 3-5 kb and 5-8 kb).   Ligate the DNA fragments (approximately 50-80 ng/μl) into linearized pBR322/BamH1 or pET11a/BamH1 plasmid vectors (approximately 80-100 ng/μl) using T4 DNA ligase overnight at 15 °C following the manufacturer’s instruction.   To propagate overexpressing plasmids library, transform 1-5 μl of ligation results into ultracompetent XL10-Gold cells following the manufacturer's protocol.   Count colony forming units (CFU) of transformants the next day and calculate the size of the libraries (1 x 105 CFU/ml of cell or more is good library size).   Combine the transformants by scraping off all colonies from the library and purify the total plasmids using Wizard Plus SV Minipreps kit.   Transform 1-3 μl of the E. coli genomic library plasmids into recipient Vibrio cholerae ΔhslO deletion.    Plate the transformants on MacConkey agar and incubate for 24 h at 43 °C to select for clones that rescue the temperature sensitive phenotype of the V. cholerae ΔhslO mutant strain (this mutant cannot grow on MacConkey plate at 43 °C).   To ensure the growth phenotype, re-streak transformants that formed healthy looking colonies on MacConkey plates and grew for 24 h at 43 °C.",
    "To eliminate the possibility of mutations in the strain background, purify and re-transform plasmids (that rescured phenotype) of transformants into V. cholerae ΔhslO mutant.   To identify inserted E. coli gene(s), purify the plasmid and send for DNA sequencing."
