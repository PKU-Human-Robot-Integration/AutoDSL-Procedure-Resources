    "All animal procedures demonstrated in this protocol have been reviewed and approved by the West Virginia University Animal Care and Use Committee under protocols 11-0412 and 14-0514 and conducted in accordance with the principles and procedures outlined in the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Animals.\n1. Animal Preparation\nAnesthetize a single mouse in an induction chamber using 3% isofluorane mixed with 1.5 L/min 100% oxygen. Remove the animal from the induction chamber and place in a supine position on the imaging platform preheated to 40 °C and maintained between 37-42 °C (Figure 2A). Confirm anesthesia by the lack of response to a toe pinch.\nPosition the mouse snout within the nosecone connected to the anesthesia system. Apply anesthesia to maintain steady state sedation (1.5% isofluorane mixed with 1.5 L/min 100% oxygen).\nApply eye lubricant the each eye to prevent drying. Apply electrode gel to the electrodes and use tape to secure each of the four paws to the corresponding electrode. The electrode pads will transmit the animal’s ECG to the imaging system to allow monitoring of heart rate and respiration rate. Lubricate and insert the rectal temperature probe for continuous monitoring of body temperature. Normal mouse body temperature is 36.9 °C. 1-2 °C variation is normal while under anesthesia.\nUse depilatory cream to remove the fur from the neck of the mouse. Rinse the neck region with water-soaked gauze to remove hair and excess depilatory cream. Optionally, use additional application of depilatory cream to remove any remaining body hair (Figure 2B).\n2. Identification and Image Acquisition of Mouse Cervical Lymph Nodes Using HFUS",
    "To begin, apply a layer of warmed ultrasound gel to the neck area devoid of fur. Use liberal application of gel for optimal image quality (Figure 2C). Avoid introducing air bubbles in the gel during application, which can interfere with ultrasonic imaging.\nAdjust the imaging platform 20-30° so the mouse is positioned with the head slightly elevated. This position helps to ensure the optimal respiration rate for the mouse. Place the 40 MHz transducer transversely in the mounting system and carefully lower it until the front of the transducer scanhead is immersed in the ultrasound gel (Figure 2C).\n\tNOTE: Be sure to not put excessive pressure onto the mouse neck, as it could cause undue respiratory distress. In addition, it is helpful for imaging to have a buffer of gel between the transducer and the mouse.\nB-Mode Imaging and Detection of Lymph Nodes:\nUsing the computer controlling the HFUS acquisition software, adjust the brightness (B-) mode settings to the following parameters: Gain 22 dB, depth 10.00 mm, width 14.08 mm.\n\tNOTE: These settings are a suggested starting point, and may require slight adjusting for optimal image acquisition between different applications. Observe normal cervical lymph nodes as oval hypoechoic structures near the skin surface within a surrounding hyperechoic field. The appearance of diseased lymph nodes can vary between models. To systematically image all lymph nodes within the neck region use the following steps:\n\t\nUse the Y-axis to scan the neck in a cranial to caudal manner towards the thoracic region. Use X-axis to center the image.",
    "Identify major landmarks: buccal cavity, tongue, and thyroid gland (Figures 3A, B and C; respectively); tilt the imaging platform to horizontally adjust the ventral surface of the mouse neck, making both sides of the neck appear even in the B-mode image. The amount of tilting depends upon the physiology of each individual mouse.\nConduct a 3D scan of the entire neck region from the buccal cavity/tongue region to the thyroid gland, in order to map lymph nodes and associated landmarks throughout the neck.\n\t\nLocate the tongue/buccal cavity region (Figure 3A) and note the numerical location on the Y scale.\nLocate thyroid gland (Figure 3C) and note the numerical location on the Y scale.\nCalculate the difference between the obtained values in (2.4.1) and (2.4.2) to determine the total length in mm for the imaged neck region.\nUse the Y knob to center the transducer on the midpoint of the determined total length.\nPress “3D”. Enter the total length. For 3D step size, use 0.076 mm to acquire the image series stack for the entire neck region.\nOnce scanning is complete, select the right or left side of the neck and center the transducer on an individual lymph node of interest, then raise the 40 MHz transducer off the mouse. Remove the 40 MHz transducer and replace with a 50 MHz microscan transducer (also in a transverse position) to obtain higher-resolution images. Replenish the ultrasound gel on the mouse neck and lower the 50 MHz transducer into the ultrasound gel.\n3D Power Doppler Imaging\nConduct 3D scans with power Doppler to asses volume and vascularity of individual cervical lymph nodes as follows:",
    "Press the Power button on the system keyboard to acquire power Dopper and adjust the following power-mode settings: PRF 4 KHz, Doppler gain 34 dB, 2D gain 30 dB, depth 5.00 mm, width 4.73 mm. NOTE: As before, these settings are a suggested starting point and may be modified as needed for optimal image acquisition in various models.\nLocate the cranial-most point of the lymph node of interest and note the location on the Y scale.\nLocate the most caudal point of the same node and note the location on the Y scale.\nCalculate the distance difference to determine the total length of the lymph node (see step 2.4.3).\nCenter the transducer on the midpoint of the determined total length, using the Y-scale location.\nPress “3D” and enter total lymph node length. Use 0.051 mm for the step size.\n\t\tNOTE: Due to the proximity of the transducer to the chest region, the 50 MHz transducer may result in an unstable Doppler image due to detection of normal respiratory motion. This can be eliminated by using the “Respiration Gating” option available under the “Physiological” tab.\nSurround the selected lymph node with the yellow box that designates the region to be analyzed by power Doppler and select “3D scan” to acquire images. Raise the transducer off of the mouse and move it to the opposite side of the neck. Lower the transducer onto the mouse and repeat the steps described above to image lymph nodes on this side of the neck.\nSave image sets for subsequent analysis.\n3. Cervical Lymph Node Biopsy",
    "Select the desired lymph node for biopsy and maintain HFUS imaging with the 50 MHz transducer. Chose the largest visible cervical lymph node in each side of the mouse neck. Lymph node enlargement typically indicates an inflammatory response, and therefore such nodes are ideal candidates for biopsy.\n\tNOTE: We have found it is very difficult to conduct biopsies on cervical nodes smaller than 10 mm3.\nPrepare the needle and syringe for biopsy by placing a 1 ml syringe with an attached 27 G, 0.5 inch needle into the syringe holder. Adjust the needle holder to orient the needle 90° to the mouse neck (Figure 4A).\nPrepare by elevating the entire mouse platform to the level of the needle. Achieve this by removing the 3D motor and switching to a taller platform, or by placing a solid object of suitable height under the provided short platform. Use a plastic microfuge tube rack for this purpose. If necessary, rotate the platform 180° in order to biopsy nodes located on the side of the neck opposite to the needle apparatus.\nAdjust the acquisition settings by selecting “Preferences”, then by choosing “Max & Extended buffer”. Enlarge the field of view to a depth of 8.00 mm and width of 9.73 mm. Turn on the needle guide using the Screen Keys dial. The needle guide will predict the path of the needle on the screen and allows the user to line up the lymph node of interest in the correct location for biopsy.\nEnsure that the lymph node remains constantly in view by centering the lymph node in the middle or slightly to the left of center in the screen (Figure 4B). To obtain the entire cine loop of the procedure, press Pre-trigger on the system keyboard before beginning the biopsy.",
    "Adjust the needle holder until the needle tip comes into view and contacts the skin (Figure 4B). Advance the needle with a firm, fast push to puncture the skin. Continue to advance the needle until the tip also punctures the capsule (Figure 4C) and is visible within the medulla (Figure 4D).\nOnce the needle is properly located within the node, gently pull the syringe plunger back between the 200-300 µl demarcations to conduct the biopsy (Figure 4D and 4E). Note that biopsy material is typically not visible within the syringe.\nGently remove the needle from the mouse neck. Expel the syringe contents into a 1.5 ml microfuge tube. Remove the needle from the syringe, leaving the needle in the tube. Collect 1 ml of biopsy media (from an aliquot, separate from the stock source) with the same syringe, and then reattach the needle to the syringe while keeping the needle in the tube.\n\t\nRinse the syringe and needle with the biopsy media by expelling the biopsy media into the tube.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not pull back on the plunger while the needle is attached at any point after the biopsy. This reduces the risk of losing the biopsy material due to the small sample size.\nConfirm lymph node content by histological means (Figure 4F) and analyze by additional methods (histochemistry, flow cytometry, etc.) as appropriate.\nOnce biopsy is complete, turn off the anesthesia and remove the rectal temperature probe. Remove excess ultrasound gel from mouse with gauze and remove the tape from each paw.\nRemove the mouse from the imaging platform and return to a cage. Minimal bleeding from biopsy site may occur, but this stops without intervention. Monitor the mouse during recovery until full activity is resumed.\n4. Image Analysis of Cervical Lymph Nodes",
    "In the ultrasound software, select the image for analysis and navigate to the “Image Processing” tab. Choose “Load into 3D”.\nSelect “3D Reconstructed Image” in top left corner, clicking on the “Display Single Pane” button. Use the zoom function to enlarge the image if desired. Toggle “Display Layout” to view the image only in B-mode, which removes the power Doppler overlay from view. This makes it easier to see the edges of the lymph node during subsequent 3-D analysis. Scroll through the image series to locate the beginning of the lymph node.\nTo circumscribe the lymph node, navigate to the “3D Settings” tab. Select “volume”, then the “Start” button next to “Parallel”.\nDraw contours around the area of interest within individual images by scrolling. Continue until images that encompass the entire lymph node are marked. Choose “Finish” to complete the analysis.\nAt the bottom of the image, 3D volume and % vascularity will be automatically displayed.\n\tNOTE: 3D volume corresponds to the lymph node volume, and percent vascularity represents the percentage of the lymph node positive for blood flow by power Doppler.\nToggle “Display Layout” to view the power Doppler imaging as an overlay on the B- mode image. On the surface view observe a net view of the volume area of interest. Export the images in tagged image file (TIF) format or 3D scans as movies (.avi) for further use."
