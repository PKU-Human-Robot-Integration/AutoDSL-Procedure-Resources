    "The first step in the isolation of single chromosomes is the induction of metaphase arrest. This is usually accomplished by a chemical block with Colcemid or colchicine. During mitosis, these chemicals block the formation of spindles and allow the condensed chromosomes to freely float within the cell. The following protocol outlines the arresting of cells in metaphase and the collection of these cells from monolayer cultures of primary cells/cell lines.\nMaterials\nCells growing exponentially in sub-confluent culture in flasks\n10 µg/ml Colcemid solution [in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); Thermo Fisher, cat. no. 15212012]\n50-ml centrifuge tubes\nStandard tabletop centrifuge\nAdditional reagents and equipment for cell culture under normal growth conditions\n1. Ensure cells growing exponentially in sub-confluent culture in flasks are truly sub-confluent and contain an exponentially growing monolayer of cells. Minimize the number of floating (non-viable) cells.\nGenerally, two T-150 flasks that are 50% to 60% confluent yield a good preparation. Each should contain 25 ml medium.\n2. Add 10 µg/ml Colcemid solution to the flasks to a final concentration between 0.01 µg/ml and 0.1 µg/ml.\nThe concentration depends on cell type. For example, for a 75% confluent T-75 flask of Chinese hamster fibroblasts, addition of 0.1 µg/ml Colcemid yields optimum results.\n3. Incubate cells with Colcemid under normal growth conditions for 3 to 15 hr.\nThe time will be dependent on the growth rate and cell cycle duration of the cells, with faster-growing cells requiring less time. For example, human fibroblasts are blocked for 10 to 12 hr, whereas Chinese hamster fibroblasts are blocked only for 3 hr.\n4. Shake off mitotic cells 2 to 3 times.",
    "This is most easily accomplished by holding the flask horizontally and “slapping” the side against your other hand, causing the medium in the flask to rapidly slosh across the monolayer. Repeat 2 to 3 times, as shaking too much can cause a loss of membrane integrity.\n5. Recover mitotic cells by pouring off medium into a 50-ml centrifuge tube on ice.\nOptional: Before centrifugation (step 6), remove a small amount of medium, stain with 10 µM Hoechst 33342, and determine the total number and percentage of mitotic cells.\n6. Centrifuge for a normal duration at a normal speed for the cell type.\nCentrifugation for 5 to 7 min at 400 × g is typical.\n7. Completely discard the supernatant.\n8. Proceed with the chosen method of chromosome isolation (see Basic Protocols 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.785#cpz1785-prot-0002] to 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.785#cpz1785-prot-0005]).",
    "This single-color method yields chromosomes that maintain the typically illustrated X shape. Use of the intercalating dye PI stabilizes the chromosome structure, so additional chemicals do not need to be used. Because this is a single-color (univariate) method, mammalian species with large numbers of chromosomes will have overlapping peaks that may not be fully resolvable. This protocol is therefore recommended for use in species with small numbers of chromosomes and/or chromosomes with highly variable DNA content or where not all chromosomes need to be resolved. For example, because cloned Chinese hamster cells have 11 pairs of chromosomes (10 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes), their karyotype can be resolved using the single-color method (as observed in Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.785#cpz1785-fig-0001]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/defaeabb-22f4-4a5e-abb7-a0028c08baf4/cpz1785-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nUnivariate display of a single set of homologous chromosomes isolated from cloned Chinese hamster cells and stained using the PI procedure.\nMaterials\nCell pellets from Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.785#cpz1785-prot-0001]\nPI solutions A and B (see recipes)\nGlass microscope slides\nWax pencil or crayon\nCoverslips\nFluorescence microscope\n3-ml syringe with 22-gauge needle (1 1/2’’)\n37°C water bath\n35- to 60-µm mesh\nCell swelling\n1.

Allow cells to swell for 10 min at room temperature in the dark.\n3. Place 10 µl cell suspension on a glass microscope slide marked with a wax pencil or crayon and cover it with a coverslip. Observe under a fluorescence microscope.\nThe wax holds the coverslip high enough to prevent damaging the cells.",
    "Ideal conditions will result in swollen cells that are visibly larger than cells in an isotonic solution. These cells should have mostly intact membranes and are therefore non-fluorescent.\nIsolation of chromosomes\n4. Add 0.25 ml PI solution B to the current suspension of 0.5 ml.\n5. Incubate at room temperature in the dark for 3 min.\nThe solution will partially dissolve the cell membrane. Under the microscope, the cells will now appear fluorescent.\n6. Rapidly draw up and expel the suspension 4 to 5 times using a 3-ml syringe with a 22-gauge needle, with the point of the needle against the side of the tube. Monitor under a microscope to ensure chromosomes have been released from the cell membranes.\n7. Incubate the chromosome suspension at 37°C in a water bath for 30 min.\n8. Filter the suspension through 35- to 60-µm mesh.\n9. Store the isolated chromosomes for ≤3 weeks at 4°C until further analysis (see Basic Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.785#cpz1785-prot-0007]).",
    "It is essential to conduct the swelling test during the standardization of Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.785#cpz1785-prot-0002] for your sample to ensure good sample preparation. This is done to establish appropriate hypotonic solution [for example, potassium chloride (KCl)] concentrations for the selected cell type. If the concentration is not optimal, the cells may swell too quickly and rupture before the chromosomes have time to increase their dispersion within the cell, or they may not swell enough, leading to incomplete lysis and cell clumping.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.785#cpz1785-prot-0002])\nHoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher, cat. no. 62249)\nDulbecco's PBS (DPBS; Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no.

Make 0.5 mg/ml Hoechst 33342 stock solution in DPBS and add 12.3 μl to 1 ml of the PI solution A containing cells to be processed (final concentration 10 μM).\n2. Using a wax pencil or crayon, draw parallel lines on a glass microscope slide under where the coverslip will be placed.\nThis holds the coverslip high enough to prevent damaging the cells.\n3. Gently add a drop or two of the cells in the solution onto the slide and carefully place a coverslip.\n4. Observe under a fluorescence microscope using ultraviolet excitation.",
    "Initially, all cells in the suspension should stain with Hoechst 33342 and appear blue (under ultraviolet excitation) and larger than cells that are not in a hypotonic solution. As time passes, the cell membranes begin to break, thereby allowing the PI to enter, changing the appearance of the chromosomes to red. If the cells are red immediately and the chromosomes appear bunched inside the cells, the solution may be too hypotonic, and optimal swelling will not be reached. In this case, try again with a higher concentration of KCl in both the PI solutions in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.785#cpz1785-prot-0002].",
    "The magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) low-molecular-weight chromosome isolation procedure was developed using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells based on the ability of MgSO4 to stabilize the chromosome (Gray et al., 1975[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.785#cpz1785-bib-0017]). This procedure has also proven to be suitable for human cells (van den Engh et al., 1984[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.785#cpz1785-bib-0034]).\nThe isolation buffer consists of KCl at a hypotonic concentration, MgSO4 as a stabilizer, HEPES buffer to maintain pH, and dithiothreitol as a reducing agent. The buffer also contains RNase, which allows for better DNA-specific staining of the isolated chromosomal preparations (Bartholdi et al., 1983[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.785#cpz1785-bib-0002]). This relatively high magnesium concentration in the isolation buffer stabilizes the DNA of the isolated chromosomes, thereby allowing the Chromomycin A3 (CA3) dye to bind (Gray & Cram, 1990[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.785#cpz1785-bib-0018]). The presence of MgSO4 at an optimum pH of 8.0 along with dithiothreitol reduces the number of chromosomal clumps.\nThe chromosomes isolated using this protocol are of low molecular weight and are appropriate for bivariate flow karyotyping. This method allows the use of DNA-binding dyes that are dependent on base composition, such as Hoechst 33258 and Chromomycin A3.\nThe protocol is advantageous when a small number of mitotic cells are available (Gray & Cram, 1990[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.785#cpz1785-bib-0018]). However, it has been reported that high magnesium concentrations can cause chromosome contraction, resulting in decreased resolution of flow cytometric measurements. This can be overcome by the addition of sodium citrate and sodium sulfite 15 min before the analysis (Trask & van den Engh, 1990[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.785#cpz1785-bib-0032]).\nMaterials\nIB01 (LMW) isolation buffer (see recipe; make fresh)\n2.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 (make fresh)\nDNA stain: PI (Thermo Fisher, cat. no.

    "High-molecular-weight DNA can be isolated using a basic buffer with high pH, ranging from 9.6 to 10.5 (Blumenthal et al., 1979[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.785#cpz1785-bib-0004]; Wray, 1973[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.785#cpz1785-bib-0039]). However, high pH affects the recovery of acidic proteins and can result in various unwanted effects on the quality of chromosomal DNA (Trask & van den Engh, 1990[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.785#cpz1785-bib-0032]). Blumenthal et al. (1979[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.785#cpz1785-bib-0004]) developed the method described here to preserve the native structure of chromosomes during isolation.\nThis protocol utilizes a neutral buffer containing polyamines (Wallace et al., 1971[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.785#cpz1785-bib-0038]). Use of polyamines such as spermidine and spermine replaces the need for divalent cations or heavy-metal chelators to stabilize the chromosomal structure and prevent nuclease activity (Wray et al., 1972)[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.785#cpz1785-bib-0040].\nThe ability to recover high-molecular-weight DNA from chromosomes has played a huge role in developing the field of flow cytogenetics and its application in cloning (Gray et al., 1987[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.785#cpz1785-bib-0019]) as well as the construction of chromosome-specific gene libraries (Van Dilla & Deaven, 1990[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.785#cpz1785-bib-0036]).

    "To ensure that all samples have high molecular weight before sorting, each sample is checked as a precaution before long-term sorting experiments.\nMaterials\nChromosomal preparation from Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.785#cpz1785-prot-0004] (after step 11) or Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.785#cpz1785-prot-0005] (after step 10)\nNuclear lysis buffer (see recipe)\n20% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS; make fresh)\n1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes\n1.

Add 25 µl nuclear lysis buffer.\n3. Add 2.5 µl of 20% SDS.\n4. Wait several seconds and then check the viscosity of the sample by stirring the preparation and by drawing a small quantity into a pipet tip and then withdrawing the tip from the preparation.\nIf the sample contains high-molecular-weight DNA (>50 kb), there will be a “string” of DNA between the pipet tip and the sample surface as the tip is withdrawn from the solution. If a string of DNA does not form, then the sample probably should not be used for chromosome sorting if the goal is to construct genomic libraries containing large DNA inserts.\nThe rate of DNA molecular-weight degradation is dependent on the cell line from which the chromosomes were isolated. Human and mouse chromosomes retain their molecular weight longer than hamster chromosomes.\nWhen sorting chromosomes from a human/hamster hybrid cell for a partial enzymatic digest and large insert library, the analysis and sorting should occur within 1 week of isolation.",
    "After the single-chromosomal suspension is prepared, it is subjected to flow cytometric analysis. This allows us to identify the individual chromosomes, apply appropriate gating strategies, and sort the chromosomal population of interest. This processing is depicted in the schematic presented in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.785#cpz1785-fig-0002].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/95d4854f-4b80-4ec4-9e1e-22dab633ccd9/cpz1785-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nOverview of the methodology for chromosome sorting, where the instrumentation shows a dual-laser system for sorting chromosomes in suspension. The flow karyogram of sorted chromosomes could be displayed by both univariate and bivariate plots when DNA dyes such as Hoechst 33258 and Chromomycin A3 have been used to label the chromosomes.\nCritical Requirements for Chromosome Sorting\nUnivariate data acquisition\nAnalysis of single-labeled (univariate) chromosomes stained with PI requires a cytometer equipped with a blue-green 488-nm laser, found virtually on all instruments. Laser power should be relatively high, typically 50 mW or more, up to 200 mW. Although cytometers used for chromosome analysis have historically been jet-in-air systems, cytometers equipped with enclosed quartz cuvettes are now almost universal and may require less laser power than older systems. However, laser power should still be maximized and considered when designing a system. Univariate analysis is done with a detector equipped with a PI filter, usually ranging from ∼575 to 630 nm (orange). Typical bandpass filters including 575/26 nm, 585/42 nm, and 630/32 nm are commonly used.\nBivariate data acquisition",
    "Analysis of Hoechst 33258 and Chromomycin A3 requires ultraviolet (320 to 365 nm) and blue (440 to 460 nm) lasers, respectively. These lasers are distinct from the usual 488-nm lasers used for PI analysis and are only available on specialized instruments. Hoechst 33258 fluorescence has historically been collected by a 420-nm long-pass filter; however, success has been reported using a blue bandpass filter (460/50 nm), and similarly, Chromomycin A3 fluorescence can be collected by a 480-nm long-pass filter or a green-to-orange bandpass filter, such as 550/50 nm (Langlois et al., 1982[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.785#cpz1785-bib-0022], Yang et al. 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.785#cpz1785-bib-0042]).\nInstrument optimization and quality control\nInstrument performance should be verified prior to analysis using uniform fluorescent microspheres excited by the lasers on the instrument. Many are available, including Spherotech Ultra microspheres, which are excited at many laser wavelengths, including ultraviolet, and are commonly used for this purpose. Not all quality-control microspheres excite using ultraviolet lasers; if using Hoechst 33258, make sure alignment particles are appropriate for this wavelength. Because chromosomes are small objects, optimization of alignment using submicron microspheres is highly recommended. Instrument alignment can be different for large objects and small ones. Optimization of a flow cytometer for chromosome analysis may require the services of a trained field service engineer informed in the specialized nature of this work.\nInstrument triggering",
    "Light scatter is the most commonly used event trigger in flow cytometry; however, because of the small size of chromosomes and the large amount of debris present in chromosome preps, this is not a reliable parameter. Instead, fluorescence should be used to trigger the instrument. As with all aspects of chromosome analysis, they should be treated as submicron objects and analyzed and sorted as all submicron objects are. Care should be taken to ensure all chromosomes are seen on the plot and are not below the threshold value.\nChromosome sorting\nPhysical separation of chromosomes on a cell sorter (as opposed to analysis only on a benchtop flow cytometer) has additional technical considerations. The smallest nozzle size with high sheath pressure and drop drive frequency is recommended for chromosome sorting. Nozzle sizes typically range from 70 to 130 μm; use the smallest size available.\nSheath buffer is used to hydrodynamically focus the sample stream through the instrument nozzle and laser beam. This buffer is normally PBS or similar for normal cell sorting. For cell sorting, the sheath buffer should match the final chromosome sample buffer. Sheath and sample buffers will mix during the sorting process; it is therefore critical that they be of the same composition. This maintains the chromosomes at a uniform pH and is ideal for high-pressure sorting. The refraction of light between different materials, or even two liquids with different refractive indices, lowers the resolution of chromosomes. By matching the sheath fluid to the liquid that the chromosomes are suspended in, one point of variation can be eliminated. This will require a large quantity of this buffer for a typical cell sort.",
    "The chromosomes must be sorted into a buffer and tube compatible with subsequent methods. Polypropylene collection tubes are recommended due to their lower electrical charge accumulation, reducing the chance of droplet spatter and dispersion during the sorting process. Because physical damage is not an issue, chromosomes can be sorted into a tube with no collection buffer. However, if a specialized collection medium is needed for post-sort processing, chromosomes can be sorted directly into tubes containing a small quantity of this material. When sorting for a long period of time, the sample and the collection tubes should be maintained at 4°C. A small number of sorted chromosomes should also be collected for post-sort purity analysis. Typical sort purities should exceed 95%."
