Flow diagram of the procedure for the estimation of glutathione in mouse microglial cell line, N9 Media preparation and cell cultureFor 1 L medium, 12 g DMEM/F12, 2.44 g sodium bicarbonate is dissolved in 890 ml of double distilled water and then 100 ml FBS along with 10 ml Pen-Strep is added. Finally media is filtered through 0.22 μm filter. N9 cells are seeded at a density of 1 x 106/2 ml in a 6-well culture plate and grown for 16-18 h in complete culture medium (DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Pen-Strep).N9 cells are passaged after every 48 h and used till 6-7 passage after thawing.Note: If any treatment is given, please ensure that dose and duration of treatment is not toxic for cells.  Cell harvesting and lysisRemove culture medium and wash the cells with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Add ice cold 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer with EDTA (KPE buffer, 1 ml) to the each well and cells are dislodged from the surface of culture flask with the help of cell scraper and collected in a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube. Centrifuge the cell suspension at 350 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Resulting cell pellet is resuspended in 200 µl KPE buffer with 1% protease inhibitor cocktail (PIC) and lysed by sonication for 5 sec pulse at 25 W two times on ice.Note: Cell scrapper is preferred instead of enzymatic dissociation to minimize the handling time. Besides, for enzymatic dissociation cells needs incubation in 37 °C whereas ice cold buffer can be used while using scrapper which is desirable during preparing cell lysate to keep structure and function of the protein unaltered.",
    "Protein sample preparation and estimationAfter sonication, lysed samples are centrifuged at 18,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C and the resulting supernatants are collected in separate pre-cooled 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes. Keep 10 µl samples in 0.5 ml tubes for protein estimation by Bradford reagent. Protein precipitationAfter protein estimation, 10 µg protein sample is precipitated. Initially 80 µl protein sample is mixed with 20 µl trichloroacetic acid (TCA) (50% stock concentration), vortexed and kept in ice for 10 min. Protein sample with TCA is centrifuged at 9,100 x g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant is transferred into a fresh 1.5 ml centrifuge tube. GSH and GSSG estimationGSH estimationMix 10 µl supernatant with equal volume of OPT (1 mg/ml) and 180 µl KPE buffer (pH-8) in a black 96 well plate. GSSG estimationTransfer 50 µl of the supernatant into a new centrifuge tube, add 0.5 µl N-ethylmaleimide (stock concentration: 4 M) and mix thoroughly.Incubate for 30 min at room temperature to inhibit GSH. Add 10 µl of this sample, 10 µl OPT and 180 µl 0.1 N NaOH (pH-12) in a black 96 well plate. Note: Use multichannel pipette to add OPT and KPE buffer mixture in the 96 well plate to minimize the time lapse.Incubate for 10 min in the dark at room temperature.Measure the fluorescence at λex: 355 nm and λem: 420 nm in a microplate reader."
