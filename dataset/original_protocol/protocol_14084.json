    "1. Enzyme and substrate preparation\nPurification of enzyme\nProduce and purify Lnt enzyme from detergent solubilized membranes as described previously4,8. Briefly, induce expression of the lnt-strep gene, encoding Lnt with a C-terminal Strep tag, at OD600 of 0.6 with anhydrous tetracycline (200 ng/mL) at 37 °C for 16 h.\nHarvest cells by centrifugation at 4,000 x g for 10 min and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in buffer WA (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA) to 100 OD600 units per mL.\nBreak the cells by two passages through a French pressure cell press at 10,000 psi.\nRemove unbroken cells and debris by centrifugation at 13,000 x g for 20 min. Keep the supernatant and discard the pellet.\nCentrifuge the supernatant at 120,000 x g for 60 min and collect the membrane vesicles (translucent brown colored pellet). Discard the supernatant.\nSolubilize the integral membrane proteins from the membrane pellet with 1% (w/v) n-Dodecyl β-D-maltoside (DDM) in buffer WA for 30 min at room temperature (RT). Centrifuge and remove insolubilized material at 120,000 x g for 30 min. Use the supernatant fraction for purification.\nPurify Lnt-strep on an affinity chromatography column (see Table of Materials) and an S400 gel filtration column (see Table of Materials) as described by Nozeret et al.8.\nStore the purified enzyme in buffer WA containing 0.05% DDM and 10% glycerol at -80 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The enzyme is stable for over 5 years.\nPreparation of alkyne-phospholipid and biotinylated Fibroblast Stimulating Ligand (FSL-1-biotin) substrates\nAliquot 100 µL of custom-synthesized alkyne-POPE (1-hexadec-15-ynoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, see Table of Materials) solubilized in chloroform into 1.5 mL tubes.\nPierce the tubes with a syringe and evaporate the chloroform in a speed-vac at RT for 2 h. Store the dry phospholipid samples at -20 °C.",
    "Dissolve alkyne-POPE in 0.1% Triton X-100 at 500 µM prior to use. Add a 3 min sonication step in an ultrasonic water bath at RT to solubilize alkyne-POPE if necessary.\nResuspend FSL-1-biotin in water at 445 µM.\n\t\tNOTE: Both solutions can be stored at -20 °C for at least 2 months.\n2. Tube assay\nNOTE: On Day 1, set up the Lnt reaction in 1.5 mL tubes (step 2.1) and coat 96 well plates with streptavidin (step 2.2).\nPreparation of reagent mixture and enzymatic reaction\nFor a standard Lnt assay, mix alkyne-POPE (final 50 µM from 500 µM stock) and FSL-1-biotin (final concentration of 50 µM from a 445 µM stock) in Lnt reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 containing 1% BSA) at a final volume of 18 µL in 1.5 mL tubes. Perform all conditions in triplicate.\nSonicate the substrate mixture (prepared in step 2.1.1) for 3 min in an ultrasonic water bath and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min prior to the addition of Lnt enzyme (step 2.1.3).\n\t\tNOTE: MTSES (sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate), a thiol-specific reagent, inhibits Lnt8. Add 10 mM MTSES (100 mM stock solution in 100% DMSO) to the reaction tubes (step 2.1.1) to be used as negative control samples. Adjust the volume of the Lnt reaction buffer so the total volume is 18 µL.\nAdd active (1 ng/µL, corresponding to 17.2 nM) or inactive Lnt (C387S) (2 µL of 10 ng/μL stock in buffer WA containing 0.05% DDM) and mix with the substrates (step 2.1.2) by pipetting up and down.\nIncubate the reaction at 37 °C for 16 h in a thermomixer with heated lid.\nStreptavidin coating of 96 well plates\nPrepare a stock solution of streptavidin at 2 mg/mL in H2O.",
    "NOTE: This solution can be stored at -20 °C for up to 6 months.\nFrom the stock solution prepare 10 µg/mL streptavidin in water as a working solution. Add 100 µL of the solution to each well of the 96 well plate. Bind streptavidin to the plate by incubating at 37 °C overnight without a lid to air-dry the wells.\nNOTE: On Day 2 perform click-chemistry (step 2.3), bind Lnt reaction mixture to streptavidin-coated plates (step 2.4), and detect fluorescence and analyze results (step 2.5).\nClick-chemistry reaction\nPrepare stock solutions of Azido-FAM (5 mM in DMSO), TCEP (Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride; 50 mM prepared in water), TBTA (Tris[(1-benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl]amine; 2 mM in tert-butanol:DMSO (4:1)), and CuSO4∙5H2O (50 mM freshly prepared in H2O).\nIn the 1.5 mL tubes containing the Lnt reaction mixture prepared in step 2.1.4, perform click-chemistry by adding the reagents in the following order: 0.2 µL of stock Azido-FAM (final concentration 50 µM), 0.4 µL of stock TCEP (final concentration 1 mM), 0.2 µL of stock TBTA (final concentration 0.02 mM).\nVortex the solution for 5 s. Then add 0.4 µL of stock CuSO4 (final concentration 1 mM). Vortex again for 5 s. Incubate the samples in the dark at RT for 1 h.\nBinding of Lnt reaction mixture to streptavidin-coated plates\nWash the wells of the streptavidin-coated plates after the overnight incubation from step 2.2.2 3x with 200 µL of PBS-T1 (PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20).\n\t\tNOTE: Streptavidin plates can be used immediately or stored dry at 4 °C.\nTransfer 18 µL from the click-chemistry mixture from step 2.3.3 to a well in a 96 well streptavidin-coated plate and add 100 µL of PBS-T1 to bind N-acyl-FSL-1-biotin-FAM product to streptavidin plates.\nUse biotin-fluorescein (0.26 µM from a 3.1 mM stock in DMSO) as positive control for streptavidin binding and fluorescence readout.",
    "Incubate the plates at RT for 1 h in the dark in a thermomixer, shaking at 300 rpm.\nPerform manual wash steps of the 96 well plates with a multichannel electronic pipette as follows: six washes with 200 µL of PBS-T2 (PBS containing 1% Tween-20), three flushes with a pipette, three washes with 200 µL of PBS, three flushes with a pipette.\nFluorescence detection and analysis\nAdd 200 µL of PBS and record the fluorescence at 520 nm in a fluorescence microplate reader. Save results in spreadsheet software.\n\t\tNOTE: Biotin-fluorescein is used as a positive control for streptavidin binding and fluorescence detection at 520 nm. A reproducible readout of 30,000–40,000 A.U. with 0.26 µM biotin-fluorescein is expected. All samples are analyzed in triplicate, including controls.\nCalculate the standard deviation for each reaction and the calculate P-values for negative controls and positive samples using unpaired t-test using a statistical software.\n3. Multiwell plate assay\nNOTE: On Day 1 set up the Lnt reaction in 384 well plates (step 3.1) and coat 384 well plates with streptavidin (step 3.2).\nPreparation of reagent mixture and enzymatic reaction\n\tNOTE: The quantity of the reagents and enzyme is reduced compared to the tube assay and the Lnt reaction is performed directly in 384 well plates. This allows the use of less material and a reduction of steps that can be further automated.",
    "Mix the substrates as follows: alkyne-POPE (final concentration 50 µM from 500 µM stock) and FSL-1-biotin (final 50 µM from 500 µM stock) in Lnt reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 containing 1% BSA) at a volume of 13.5 µL per reaction per well in a 384 well plate format.

Adjust the volume of Lnt buffer (step 3.1.1) to reach a final reaction volume of 13.5 µL.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 5 min prior to the addition of Lnt enzyme (step 3.1.5).\nAdd 0.5 ng/µL (corresponding to 8.6 nM) active Lnt enzyme, or inactive variant (C387S) (1.5 µL from 5 ng/µL stock in buffer WA containing 0.05% DDM) in Lnt reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% BSA) to each well containing the reaction mixture from step 3.1.3. Mix reagents by pipetting up and down. The total reaction volume is 15 µL.\nSeal the plate with plastic foil for multiwell plates.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 16 h in a thermomixer with heated lid.\nStreptavidin coating 384 well plates\n\t\nUse 75 µL of streptavidin (10 µg/mL in H2O) from step 2.2.2 to coat wells of a 384 well plate. Let streptavidin bind to the plate by incubating at 37 °C overnight without a lid to air-dry the wells.",
    "NOTE: On Day 2 perform click-chemistry (step 3.3), bind Lnt reaction mixture to streptavidin-coated plates (step 3.4), detect fluorescence, and analyze results (step 3.5).\nClick-chemistry reaction\n\t\nPrepare stock solutions of Azido-FAM (1.2 mM in DMSO), TCEP (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride; 24 mM prepared in H2O), TBTA (Tris[(1-benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl]amine; 0.48 mM in tert-butanol:DMSO (4:1)) and CuSO4∙5H2O (24 mM freshly prepared in H2O).\nCombine the three click-chemistry reagents: a mixture of Azido-FAM (final concentration 50 µM), TCEP (1 mM final), and TBTA (0.02 mM final), each at 0.75 µL in final volume of 2.25 µL per well. Calculate the required volume per 384 well plate (i.e., use 864 µL when all wells of the 384 well plate are used). Mix vigorously.\nAdd 2.25 µL of the reagent solution per well directly to the completed Lnt reaction in the 384 well plate from step 3.1.7.\nMix by pipetting up and down with a multichannel electronic pipette.\nAdd CuSO4 (0.75 µL from 24 mM stock for a 1 mM final concentration) and mix by pipetting up and down with a multichannel electronic pipette.\nIncubate at RT for 1 h in the dark.\nBinding of Lnt reaction mixture to streptavidin-coated 384 well plates\nWash the wells of the streptavidin-coated plates after the overnight incubation from step 3.2.1 1x with 85 µL PBS-T1.\nTransfer 11 µL of the click-chemistry reaction from each well of the incubation plate from step 3.3.6 to the streptavidin-coated plate from step 3.4.1 to bind the N-acyl-FSL-1-biotin-FAM product to the streptavidin plates.\nAdd 64 µL of buffer PBS-T1.\nInclude biotin-fluorescein (0.19 µM from a 3.1 mM stock in DMSO) as a control for binding to streptavidin-coated wells.\nIncubate the 384 well plates at RT for 1 h in the dark in a thermomixer, shaking at 300 rpm.",
