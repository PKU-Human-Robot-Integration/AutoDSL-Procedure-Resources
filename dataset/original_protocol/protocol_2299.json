    "Step-by-step method and details\nStep-by-step method and details\nTiming: 2 h\nDissociation of embryonic brain tissue and primary culture.\nThis section describes the derivation of viable hNSCs from embryonic brain tissue.\nNote: This protocol should be performed under sterile conditions.\nAdd 200 μL Liberase Blendzyme to 15 mL of warmed PBS. It is recommended to use a 50 mL conical tube.\nNote: If immediate dissociation is not possible, sample can be dissected into smaller portions and frozen down in fetal bovine serum supplemented with 10% DMSO.\nNote: The amount of Liberase Blendzyme used will vary depending on the size of the tissue; 200 μL is suitable for a roughly 1cm by 1cm tissue sample. For smaller tissue samples, decrease the volume of Liberase Blendzyme used. For larger tissue samples, dissect the tissue into dime-sized portions and process separately until step 8. Liberase Blendzyme can be aliquoted and stored in -20°C and thawed prior to each use.\nWash embryonic brain tissue with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to remove excess blood. Any pieces of hard tissue should be removed with sterile forceps and discarded.\nUsing scissors or a razor blade, disaggregate tissue into a slurry consistency ensuring sufficient solution volume to prevent tissues from drying out.\nTransfer fragmented slurry into the pre-warmed PBS prepared in step 1.\nPlace the sample in a pre-warmed shaking incubator for 15 min.\nFilter the sample into a new sterile 50 mL conical tube through a 70μm cell strainer. The neural stem cells (NSCs) will be transferred into the fresh tube.\nCentrifuge the NSCs for 5 min at 290g at room temperature.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 4–12 mL of RBC lysis buffer.",
    "Note: The volume of RBC lysis buffer added will depend on the pellet size and number of red blood cells (i.e., if the pellet is white, 4 mL should suffice. If the pellet is a dark red colour, 12 mL should be used). The RBC lysis step can be repeated 1–2 more times if pellet is still pink or red in color (should be white).\nIncubate the cells for 5 min at room temperature.\nAdd an equal volume of PBS and centrifuge the sample for 5 min at 290 g.\nIf the pellet is still red in color, repeat steps 8–10. Otherwise, proceed to step 12.\nRemove the supernatant and wash the cells with 5 mL of sterile PBS. Centrifuge the sample for 5 min at 290 g.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 10 mL NCC supplemented with Mycozap and transfer to 10 cm ultra-low plate (or 60mm plate if the pellet is smaller). Cells are expected to form neurospheres in 3–7 days (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1907-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. hNSC197 P11 neurospheres 10X grown in suspension in ultra-low binding plates\nNote: As samples are collected from the hospital before being transferred for processing in sterile biosafety cabinets, there are risks of mycoplasma contamination during the handover. We recommend culturing the hNSCs in Mycozap media for 2 weeks prior to use for experiments. Mycozap can be aliquoted and stored at −20°C and thawed prior to each use.\nIf the color of the media begins to turn orange or yellow in color within the first week of culture, add fresh media to the existing media (i.e., do not change the media for the first week of culture).",
    "Note: It is recommended that media changes remain minimal in the initial stages when cell density is low as the hNSCs produce endogenous EGF and FGF that are beneficial in promoting cell proliferation and viability. Media should initially be supplemented only based on changes in acidity and as cell density increases with gradual increases in removing and replacing fresh media.\nAfter 1–2 weeks in culture, NSCs can be cryopreserved and/or kept in culture and expanded on polyornithine-laminin PoL plates (see below for plate preparation details) for downstream applications.\nNote: It is recommended to save multiple copies of early passage hNSCs (P1-P6) as long-term culture and multiple enzymatic passaging will eventually lead the hNSCs into senescence and/or differentiation. We do not recommend using hNSCs beyond 8–10 enzymatic passages, or after their growth is observed to be significantly slowed.\nCryopreservation of primary hNSC culture\nTiming: <1 h\nThis section describes the cryopreservation of hNSCs.\nNote: For cryopreservation of hNSCs in suspension follow steps 16–24, for cryopreservation of adherent hNSCs on PoL plates first follow steps 42–45 then return to step 18.\nPre-warm media in the 37°C water bath.\nCollect hNSCs in suspension into 50 mL conical tube.\nRinse plate an additional 1–2 times with PBS collecting the additional rinses.\nCentrifuge the sample for 5 min at 290 g at room temperature.\nResuspend cells in 1 mL of warm NCC media.\nAssess cell viability using a dye exlusion test such as Trypan Blue solution.\nNote: It is recommended to cryopreserve a minimum of 1 × 106 hNSCs per vial (ideally 2–5 × 106 per vial) to account for cell loss during the cell freezing and thawing process.",
    "Transfer desired number of cells to cryovial(s) and supplement with 100 μL of DMSO ensuring that the final volume is 1 mL of 10% DMSO in NCC per vial.\nTransfer vials to a freezing container and move the container into a −80°C freezer.\nTransfer vials to liquid nitrogen after 24 h for long term storage.\nPolyornithine-laminin (PoL) plate preparation\nTiming: 24h\nThis section describes the preparation of PoL plates for efficient hNSC primary culture expansion.\nNote: Prepare PoL plate 24 h prior to cell culture, it is highly recommended to grow hNSCs on PoL plates as the rate of expansion is the significantly faster when grown adherently as compared to hNSCs grown in suspension.\nDilute 0.01% poly-L-ornithine solution 1:5 in PBS without calcium and magnesium.\nCoat entire surface of cell culture plate with diluted poly-L-ornithine solution and leave in the incubator for 1–3 h (suggested volumes are as follows: 7 mL for 100mm dish, 5 mL for T25, 2 mL for 60 mm dish).\nNote: Laminin should be thawed on ice to avoid laminin solidifying, if laminin forms gel it is no longer viable.\nDilute laminin (stock is 1mg/mL) in PBS for final concentration of 5μg/mL.\nRinse plate gently with PBS then coat entire plate with diluted laminin solution (7 mL for 100 mm dish, 5 mL for T25, 2 mL for 60 mm dish).\nIncubate plate overnight (16–24 h) at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nNote: Plate can be used right away or stored in 4°C with parafilm seal for up to 2 weeks.\nIn vitro hNSC primary culture propagation\nTiming: 2 weeks for ∼ 2 × 107 cells from a freshly thawed early passage vial (less than P15) of hNSCs\nThis section describes the expansion of hNSCs for downstream applications.\nPre-warm media in 37°C water bath.",
    "Retrieve hNSCs vial from liquid nitrogen and immediately transfer to a 37°C water bath.\nAs soon as vial is thawed, acclimate it with 1 mL of warm media in a drop wise manner and transfer to a 15 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge the cells for 5 min at 290 g at room temperature and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend cells in 1 mL of warm media, pipetting up and down gently 3–4 times.\nAssess the cell viability with Trypan Blue on clean countess slides.\nPlate hNSCs on PoL coated plates at approximately 5 × 104 cells per cm2 (3 × 106 cells on a 100 mm dish) with appropriate media volume (approximately 8 mL total volume for a 100 mm dish).\nEnsure even coating of cells across plate.\nIncubate plate at 37°C, 5% CO2 allowing cells to adhere for 24 h.\nReplace half the media with warm fresh media the next day.\nAs cells propagate, increase the total volume of media in the culture plate ensuring daily media changes and avoiding full replacement of media at once unless passaging.\nCells can be passaged once they reach greater than 85% confluency (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1907-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. hNSC197 P11 10X adherently grown on PoL plate at 85% confluency\nNote: hNSCs should be ideally passaged at confluency (90–95%) to ensure higher seeding density and lower passage numbers.\nTo passage cells, remove media and rinse plate gently with PBS rocking back and forth 2–3 times.\nRemove PBS and add TrypLE until solution is covering entirety of the plate (approximately 1 mL for 100 mm dish, 0.5 mL for 6 well dish).\nIncubate plate for 2–5 min at 37°C, 5% CO2.",
    "Once cell detachment is complete, add 1–2 mL of PBS to collect cells gently pipetting up and down to break up clumps and collect into a 15 mL conical tube.\nRinse plate an additional 1–2 times with PBS collecting the additional rinses.\nCentrifuge the cells for 5 min at 290 g at room temperature.\nResuspend cells in 1 mL of warm media.\nAssess the cell viability with Trypan Blue on clean countess slides.\nFollow plating and upkeep instructions in steps 36–40.\nNote: It is recommended hNSCs be plated onto tissue culture plates 24–48 h prior to functional/stem cell assays to form neural spheres as suspension culture."
