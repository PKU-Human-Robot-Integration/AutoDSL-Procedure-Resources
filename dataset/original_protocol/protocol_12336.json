    "Massachusetts General Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved all procedures under protocol number #2010N000106. This is in compliance with the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) guidelines.\n1. Reagents and Materials Preparation\nPrepare 1 L of 50X E3 embryo medium (See Table 1) and prepare 1 L of 1X E3 embryo medium (See Table 2).\nPrepare E3 embryo medium with N-Phenylthiourea (PTU) by adding 30 mg of PTU to 1 L of 1X E3. Stir O/N to ensure that the PTU has completely dissolved. Store at RT.\nTo prepare pronase solution, dilute 150 µl of pronase (0.5 mg/ml) with 15 ml of 1X E3. This amount is sufficient for 1 petri dish. Use immediately.\nPrepare Methylcellulose solution.\n\t\nPrepare E3-tricaine solution by mixing 75 ml of 0.2% tricaine with 25 ml of 1X E3. Boil 3 g of methylcellulose in the 75 ml of E3-tricaine solution.\nMake up the final volume to 100 ml with E3-tricaine solution. The final methylcellulose solution is viscous and opaque with a yellowish tint. Storage: RT protected from the light.\nTamoxifen stock and induction solution\n\t\nPrepare 5 mM tamoxifen stock solution by dissolving 4-hydroxytamoxifen in 100% ethanol. Store stock at -80 °C.\nPrepare fresh dilution of tamoxifen at the desire concentration in 1X E3 to obtain the induction solution. CAUTION! Please consult MSDS before use.\nPrepare 1 L of 0.2% tricaine as per Table 3.\nObtain confocal slides. Glue four coverglass (18 x 18) together to form a block then place 2 blocks on a 24 x 60 coverglass 2 cm apart to allow mounting of the embryo in the middle.\n2. Embryo Preparation\nTransgenic lines.\n\tNOTE: Zebrabow-M was a generous gift from Alex Schier’s laboratory.\nsox10: ERT2-Cre",
    "NOTE: Generate the targeting vector pDestTol2-sox10:ERT2-Cre using standard molecular cloning methods and commercially obtained recombination cloning technology.\n\t\nCombine 5’ entry clone (pENTR5’-sox10p) containing 7.2Kb of the sox10 promoter, a Gateway middle clone (pME-ERT2-Cre), and a 3’ entry clone (pENTR3’-polyA) in an LR reaction with lens destination vector pDestTol2-α-crystallin:YFP.\nPurify construct pDestTol2-sox10:ERT2-Cre. Co-inject the purified construct (100 ng/µl) with Tol2 transposase mRNA (50 ng/µl) into WT embryos (F0) at the one cell stage.\nScreen F0 adult founders for germ-line transmission based on strong yellow fluorescence in F1 embryos.\nsox10: ERT2-Cre;Zebrabow-M\n\t\nOutcross the Zebrabow-M line (2.1.1) with the sox10:ERT2-Cre transgenic line.\nSelect embryos exhibiting a strong ubiquitous RFP expression and YFP lens marker and grow them till adults.\n3. Embryo Collection\nSet up several pairs of sox10:ERT2-Cre;Zebrabow-M transgenic zebrafish between 5 pm and 6 pm on Day 1.\nThe following day, pull the dividers in the morning and collect the eggs around noon.\nTransfer them to petri dishes and add 15 ml of the pronase solution to dechorionate the embryos.\nIncubate the embryos for 1 to 5 min until approximately 60% of the embryos have been dechorionated. Stop the reaction by decanting the pronase solution and wash the embryos 3-4 times with fresh E3 medium.\nIncubate the dechorionated embryos in E3 at RT O/N and let them develop to reach the 10 somites stage. Incubate 50-60 embryos per clutch to avoid different developmental growth.\n4. Treatment\nCheck the embryos’ developmental stage under a light field microscope to ensure they are at the 10 somites stage.\nUsing a fluorescent microscope with a red fluorescent protein (RFP) filter, isolate the bright red embryos.\nProceed to the induction of the Cre-recombination by adding 10 µM of hydroxytamoxifen solution to the petri dish and incubating the isolated embryos at 28.5 °C for 3 hr.",
    "Decant the tamoxifen solution and wash the embryos several times with E3.\n\tCAUTION! discard the tamoxifen solution in a special biological waste container.\nIncubate the embryos at 28.5 °C O/N.\nWhen the embryos are approximately the 28-29 somites stage (around 24 hr post fertilization), incubate the embryos at 28.5 °C in E3-PTU solution hereafter.\n\tNOTE: PTU is here used to inhibit formation of melanophores in the developing embryos. This treatment is necessary to avoid the signal distortion of fluorescence by auto-fluorescent melanophores.\nIncubate the embryos at 28.5 °C\n5. Embryo Selection\nTo visualize the fully developed craniofacial structures, select the embryos at 4 days post fertilization for the intensity of the Red signal and Cre expression marker positivity (yellow in the retina).\nAnesthetize the embryos with E3/0.015% tricaine solution. Anesthesia is confirmed when no active movements or fin activity is observed when gently prodding the embryo.\n6. Mounting the Embryo in Methycellulose\nTransfer the selected embryo for imaging into a petri dish containing a drop of methylcellulose and gently embalm the embryo with methylcellulose.\nOn a clean confocal slide, place a drop of fresh methylcellulose and mount your embryo within the drop using a microloader tip. Position embryo dorsally taking caution not to touch the embryo directly.\nCover the mounted embryo with a 25 x 25 coverslip and adjust the position of the embryo if necessary by manipulating the coverslip.\nThe embryo is now ready to image.\n7. Analysis by Fluorescence Microscopy\nUse the 20x dry lens objective (numerical aperture 0.75; pinhole size 2.0 µm) for focusing the embryo.\nPress the L100 button on the microscope and select the channels in the software.\nSelect the confocal setup button and click ‘auto’ and select the following channels before closing the window: Ch1: CFP, Ch2: GFP, Ch3: RFP or mCherry",
    "Turn on Ch2 and Ch3 before clicking the ‘remove interlock’ button. Click ‘play’ to begin scanning.\nFocus on structure of interest, which is best done by starting with ½ frame/sec and high voltage (HV) 150 and then adjusting the settings accordingly until the desired image quality is achieved. The RFP would be brighter than other colors, therefore adjust the HV. Change the Z position to find both YFP and RFP positive cells.\nOnce set with the settings, capture the image of your embryo. Save your picture in the confocal imaging software format and TIFF format for image processing in each split channel.\nNext, for CFP imaging, turn off Ch2 and Ch3 and turn on Ch1. Re-adjust the settings as in step 5 without changing the focus area.\n\tNOTE: CFP can be really hard to detect due to background signal in blue channel that can be circumvented by adjusting the pinhole size. A larger pinhole size permits better detection of the fluorescence by reducing signal/background noise ratio. However, a larger pinhole will reduce confocal effect, compromising image quality. Therefore, careful adjustment of the settings is required to achieve the desired image quality and intensity.\nCapture the image and save it in the both format (confocal software and TIFF) for image processing. Images can then be processed using common image processing software to merge layers and improve color settings as described by Pan and colleagues 8.\nSubscription Required.
