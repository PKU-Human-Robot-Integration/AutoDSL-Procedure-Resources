  "procedures": [
    "The use of mice was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Johns Hopkins University. Experiments were performed on juvenile (20 - 26 days post-partum, dpp) C57BL/6J mice, taking advantage of the semi-synchronous first wave of spermatogenesis. However, this technique can also be performed using adult mice.\n1. Dissection and isolation of mouse seminiferous tubules\nPrepare the fix/lysis solution and antibody dilution buffer (ADB) described in Table 1 and Table 2.\nPrepare one 35-mm Petri dish with 3 mL of 1x phosphate buffered saline (1x PBS, pH 7.4), and another 35-mm dish with 2 mL of fix/lysis solution per mouse.\nSacrifice the mouse via cervical dislocation or CO2 asphyxiation and spray the ventral abdomen with 70% ethanol. Open the abdominopelvic cavity using sterile scissors, making a V-shaped opening. Then remove the testes by pulling on the epididymal fat pad using forceps, and avoid disturbing the tunica albuginea. Place the testes in a 35-mm Petri dish containing 1x PBS.\nNOTE: Utilize the first wave of spermatogenesis in order to observe an enriched cell population of interest14. Specific stages of spermatogenesis are enriched at different mouse ages (Table 3).\nRemove the testicular tunica albuginea by puncturing the tissue with sharp tipped forceps and collect the loose seminiferous tubules. Transfer the tubules to a new 35-mm Petri dish containing 2 mL of fix/lysis solution.\nIncubate the tubules in the fix/lysis solution for 5 min at room temperature.\n2. Preparation of seminiferous tubules\nPrepare a poly-L-lysine coated glass slide by outlining the edges of the slide with a liquid blocker pen.\nApply 100 µL of fix/lysis solution to the center of the glass slide.\nUsing sterile forceps and scissors gently tease apart the seminiferous tubules. Cutting out long individual tubule segments approximately 20 mm in length.",
    "NOTE: To visualize structures that are sensitive to prolonged fixative exposure, such as the centrosomes, Separate the tubules first in the 1x PBS, then directly mince the tubules on the surface of the poly-lysine slides coated in 100 µL of fix-lysis solution.\nTransfer five 20 mm long seminiferous tubule segments to the prepared poly-L-lysine coated glass slide containing fix/lysis solution.\nUsing sterile scissors mince seminiferous tubules into 1.5 to 3.0 mm segments.\nUsing sterile forceps arrange the tubule segments on the glass slide so that no tissue overlaps, and the tubules are distributed evenly.\nNOTE: The optimal number of tubule segments on a glass slide is between 20 and 40.\n3. Squashing of the seminiferous tubules\nTransfer the glass slide containing dispersed seminiferous tubule segments onto a benchtop. Remove excess liquid using a laboratory wipe to avoid losing tissue during the squash step.\nApply a coverslip (22 x 60 - 1.5 mm) on top of the glass slide and apply pressure with the heel of the palm for 10 - 20 seconds. It is important to apply enough force to disperse spermatocytes from the seminiferous tubules.\nNOTE: Observe the tubules using a dissection microscope in order to optimize the squashing step so that all tubule segments are disrupted.\nUsing slide forceps, immediately flash freeze the glass slide in a small dewar of liquid N2 for 15 seconds, or until the liquid ceases to bubble. If immunolabeling immediately, remove the coverslip with a straight edge razor blade, fine tip forceps or 21-gauge needle.",
    "NOTE: For optimal results, immunolabel the slides immediately (see step 4). However, at this point slides can be preserved at -80 °C for up to two weeks. To maximize the lifetime of proteins and cellular structures, immediately store the slides on dry ice or transfer to a -80 °C freezer, and keep the coverslip on the slide. When immunolabeling stored slides, remove the coverslip by immersing the slides in liquid N2 for 15 seconds, as described in step 3.3.\n4. Immunolabeling of mounted seminiferous tubules\nImmerse the slide in 1x PBS, and wash three times for 5 min in a 50-mL Coplin jar containing 1x PBS.\nNOTE: Never allow the slides to completely dry during immunolabeling.\nApply 1 mL of antibody dilution buffer onto the glass slide to block for 1 - 2 h in a humidified chamber.\nRemove the antibody dilution buffer and apply 100 µL of primary antibody diluted in antibody dilution buffer in a humidified chamber.\nNOTE: For best results, incubate primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Use smaller volumes of antibody (e.g. 50 µL) by covering the slide with a coverslip or parafilm. Validate and optimize primary antibodies15.\nRinse slides three times for 5 min in a 50 mL Coplin jar containing 1x PBS.\nNOTE: To enhance washes, agitate Coplin jars by using a small magnetic stir bar and place on a magnetic stir plate at low speed, or place the Coplin jar on a tabletop mixer at low speed.\nApply 100 µL of secondary antibody diluted in antibody dilution buffer for 1 to 1.5 h in a humidified chamber at room temperature. Incubate the slides in a dark box to avoid photo bleaching of fluorophore conjugated antibodies.\nNOTE: Use smaller volumes of antibody (e.g. 50 µL) by covering the slide with a coverslip or parafilm.",
    "Rinse slides two times for 5 min in a 50-mL Coplin jar containing 1x PBS.\nMount the slides in mounting medium containing 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1.5 µg/mL) and apply coverslips (22 x 60 - 1.5 mm).\nSeal the coverslips to the slides with clear nail polish to preserve the slides and prevent the coverslips from moving.\n5. Analysis and imaging tubule squash preparations\nUse an epifluorescence microscope with automated stage that enables precise Z-axis movement and a high-resolution camera for image capturing. Alternatively, use a laser confocal microscope.\nNOTE: Use any available hardware and software for this step. For example, images displayed in Figure 1 and Figure 2 were captured using a Zeiss Cell Observer Z1 linked to an ORCA-Flash 4.0 CMOS camera and analyzed with the Zeiss ZEN 2012 blue edition image software.\nAssess the slides using a 20X objective to determine the quality of the squash preparation. Good quality slides have a monolayer of nuclei that are evenly distributed.\nNOTE: Some sections of the slide may be better than others, it is useful to note the coordinates of where the best regions of the slide can be found for further analysis using higher magnification.\nUsing higher magnification objective (e.g. 63X or 100X), capture regions of the slide that have a consistent monolayer of nuclei. Once a region is selected, set the upper and lower Z-stacks to ensure that all in-focus light is captured.\nNOTE: The optimal number of Z-stacks captured between the upper and lower limit is generally designated by the image acquisition software and is different for each objective.\nUse the image processing software to compile an extended depth focus image. The software combines the in-focus light from each Z-stack, and is essential for optimal imaging of tubule squash preparations.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
