    "This study and the use of human blood samples were approved by the Ethics Committee of The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University (GYYY-2016-73). All participants have given their written consent independently or through their parents (in the case of children).\n1. Basic information of the study group\nNOTE: Venous blood was collected from patients who visited the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University (Hospital 1) and the Fifth Affiliated (Zhuhai) Hospital of Zunyi Medical University (Hospital 2). The instrument used for blood routine examination in Hospital 1 is Reference system 1, while Hospital 2 uses Reference system 2.\nA total of 1066 blood samples were collected from patients who visited Hospital 1 (532) and Hospital 2 (534) and underwent blood routine examinations during January 2021.\n\t​NOTE: Patients were randomly selected, came from multiple departments and suffer from various diseases.\nExclude patients with incomplete medical records, and those who were not cooperative or refused to give informed consent. Exclude those patients whose blood samples exhibited hemolysis, chyle blood, or cloudiness, or if the blood was inadequate in volume or stored for more than 24 h.\n2. Study flow and measurements of interest\nNOTE: The evaluated system needs 5 µL of the blood sample for determining WBC and the three classification parameters. After collecting blood, the evaluated system and the reference system were used for blood routine examination.\nDetect WBC and the three classification parameters of 532 and 534 blood samples using the reference system and the evaluated system, respectively.\n\t\nLet a highly trained technician randomly renumber the selected blood samples after completing the clinical test with the reference system. Then, hand over the samples to another highly trained technician for detection of the WBC and classification parameters using the evaluated system.\nReveal the results of the two systems.",
    "Ask a third technician to analyze the five indicators (namely WBC count, Gran#, Gran%, Lym#, Lym%) shared by both evaluated and reference systems only.\n3. Procedure for using the evaluated system\nNOTE: The evaluated system uses the electrical impedance principle (Coulter principle) to count WBC in the detection element. The testing protocol is divided into six parts: start the analyzer, test preparation, blood collection, reagent mixing, sample analysis, and turn off the analyzer.\nStart the analyzer\nTurn the [O/I] power switch on the back of the analyzer to [I]. Check that the indicator light of the analyzer is on.\nEnter the correct username and password in the login dialog box and click on Login. Ensure that the system performs self-check and start-up initialization automatically and then displays the Sample Analysis home page.\nTest preparation\n\tNOTE: A complete blood sample test requires four consumables: blood lancet, hemolytic reagent, quantitative pipette with a capillary tube inside, and blood cell detection module (Figure 1).\n\t\nClick on Next Sample, correctly enter the gender, name, and other clinical information (as required), and select an appropriate reference group. Click on OK to save the information.\n\t\tNOTE: Different age groups have their own reference interval, so choosing the right reference group can get a more suitable alarm prompt. Newborn: 1-28 days old; Children: 29 days to 14 years old; Adult Male/Female/General: more than or equal to 15 years old.\nTear the thin film of the blood cell detection module, press the Entry/Exit warehouse button, and place the blood cell detection module into the machine warehouse correctly, with its orifice facing outward.\nPuncture the hemolytic reagent sealing film with the tip of a quantitative pipette.\nBlood collection",
    "Capillary blood collection: Disinfect the left ring finger with a cotton swab dipped in alcohol one way and once. After the alcohol naturally dries out, use a blood lancet to puncture the skin of the left ring finger.\n\t\t\nGently squeeze out the first drop of blood and wipe it with a cotton swab. Squeeze out enough blood to form a full \"waterdrop\" and collect 5 µL of the blood sample using the capillary tube inside the quantitative pipette.\nVenous blood collection: Collect 5 µL of the pre-obtained venous blood sample using the capillary tube inside the quantitative pipette. All tests in this study used venous blood which was collected from each patient (5 mL) using a vacuum vessel containing EDTA-K2 anticoagulant. Complete all tests within 30 min to 24 h.\nReagent mixing\nInsert the quantitative pipette into the hemolytic reagent (2.5 mL) and press it tightly to release the blood sample from the capillary tube.\nMix the blood in the capillary tube and hemolytic reagent by turning it upside down 15-20 times at a constant speed, until no obvious red blood remains in the capillary tube. In this study, the blood sample is mixed with hemolytic reagent at a ratio of 1:500.\nSample analysis\nOpen the lid and squeeze the solution into the blood cell detection module.\nPress the Entry/Exit warehouse button. After the blood cell detection module enters the warehouse, press the Counting button.\n\t\tNOTE: A flashing green indicator light indicates that the analyzer is counting. The blood cell detection module will automatically exit the warehouse after counting, and it should be removed and disposed of properly. Each test takes only 30 s.\nOn the analyzer interface, click on the OK button twice to confirm that the blood cell detection module has been taken out.",
    "On the analyzer interface, click on the Print button to print the test results.\nTurn off the analyzer\nOn the analyzer interface, click on the shutdown button, and select Yes in the dialog box that pops up on the interface. Check that the system starts to execute the shutdown sequence.\nSet the [O/I] switch on the back of the mainframe to [O] after the shutdown sequence is completed.\n4. Statistical analysis\nDetect the outliers using the generalized extreme studentized deviate (ESD) method and eliminate these outliers for follow-up statistical analysis according to the requirements of the American Association for Clinical Laboratory Standardization (CLSI) EP9-A3 document8.\nCalculate the descriptive parameters such as means and standard deviations (SDs) for normally distributed continuous data; medians and 25%-75% interquartile ranges for nonnormally distributed data; and frequencies and percentages for categorical data.\nUse Pearson χ2 test or Fisher's exact test to determine the degree of relationship between categorical variables. Use the Paired-Sample T-test or Mann-Whitney U test to compare numerical data between groups.\nShow the distribution and linear association of the detected results of the two systems by scatter plots. Apply Spearman's nonparametric correlation test to access the degree of relationship between the quantitative variables. Use Bland-Altman plots and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to verify the agreement between quantitative values detected by the two systems.\nAnalyze the data by statistical software of choice. P-value < 0.05 is considered statistically significant.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
