    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nEmbryo Preparation\nTiming: 2–3 h\nThe following sample preparation steps were optimized for early C. elegans embryos, but may also be applicable to other tissue samples of similar thickness (20–30 μm). The initial simultaneous fixation and sample clearing step is key to obtain low non-specific and cytoplasmic staining. Embryos are isolated from C. elegans adults, fixed using paraformaldehyde, permeabilized, and cleared before FISH probe hybridization:\nCoat a 40 mm round coverslip with poly-L-lysine.\nPre-clean the coverslip with >95% ethanol and dry well with a dust-free wipe.\nPipet a small amount (2–3 μL) of poly-L-lysine onto the center of the cleaned coverslip.\nTurn the pipet tip parallel to the coverslip and rub the solution evenly across the glass until it has dried.\nAllow the coverslip to dry for at least 2 h at 20°C–23°C before use, protected from light and dust. Use within 2 days.\nNote: It is important that the film dries evenly on the coverslip surface to create a uniform layer for the embryos. Alternative coating procedures can be followed, such as using diluted poly-L-lysine and drying the coverslip in an oven (see Sigma-Aldrich product technical bulletin).\nDissect embryos and adhere to coverslip.\nTransfer ∼50 adult C. elegans into a watchglass with 200 μL MQ-H2O.\nUsing a needle, dissect embryos from adult animals under a dissecting microscope.\nRemove adult bodies and as much MQ-H2O as possible from the watchglass.\nRinse the embryos with fresh MQ-H2O twice.\nPipet dissected embryos to the coated coverslip. Let them settle and adhere for 5 min.\nNote: Embryos may also be isolated by standard C. elegans bleaching protocols (Stiernagle, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nRemove as much MQ-H2O as possible, but do not allow the embryos to dry out.\nSimultaneous fixation and first permeabilization.",
    "Critical: The presence of detergent at the fixation step improves cytoplasmic clearance in the embryo. Prepare the fixation solution immediately prior to this step.\nPipet 50 μL of fixation solution onto embryos.\nPlace a 20 × 20 mm square coverslip over this drop to create a sandwich. See Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/180-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Sample Preparation\n(A) Schematic of initial sample preparation. Embryos are adhered to a coverslip suitable for the flow chamber and sandwiched with a second coverslip.\n(B) Image of a round coverslip with embryos in a drop near the center.\n(C) Image of the coverslip-embryo-coverslip sandwich.\nWick away fixation solution with a dust-free wipe until the square coverslip touches the embryo shell. Monitor the embryos during this step using a dissection microscope. Do not over-compress the embryos.\nIncubate at 20°C–23°C for 5 min.\nPlace sandwich on a metal block pre-cooled with dry ice for 30 min minimum, with the square coverslip facing up.\nPause Point: Sandwiches can be stored at least a few months at −80°C at this point in a frost-free container.\nWith a razor blade, quickly flick off the square coverslip from the frozen sandwich while it is still on the metal block. This step removes the top layer of the embryo shell.\nCritical: Keep the sandwich on the dry ice-cooled block and do not allow the sample to thaw.\nImmediately submerge the round coverslip with embryos in ice-cold methanol for 5 min.\nWash in 1× PBS for 5 min. A volume of 10 mL is sufficient for each washing step.\nWash 3× in PBST (PBS/0.5% Triton) for 15 min each.\nCritical: Use freshly prepared PBST.\nWash in 1× PBS for 5 min.\nWipe away excess liquid.",
    "RNase A treatment. Prepare 2 μL 10 mg/mL RNase A in 400 μL 2× SSC. Apply 100 μL per coverslip and incubate at 37°C for 30 min in a humid chamber.\nWipe away excess liquid.\nBlock the sample for 1 h at 37°C with 100 μL Hybridization buffer/50% formamide in a humid chamber.\nCritical: Ensure the blocking and hybridization buffers are well mixed.\nNote: This temperature is used for probes with 30 nt homology to genomic sequence. For probes with 42 nt homology to genome target, increase all 37°C temp steps beginning with blocking to 47°C. Optimal temperatures for other probe lengths should be empirically determined.\nPrimary Probe Hybridization\nTiming: 2–3 days\nPrimary FISH probes are hybridized to their genomic targets.\nPrepare the primary probe at ∼1 μM final concentration in Hybridization buffer/50% formamide. Mix well.\nNote: Optimal probe concentrations should be empirically determined for each newly prepared library amplification product.\nRemove as much blocking solution as possible from the coverslip with the sample by wiping carefully around the sample with a dust-free wipe.\nApply 30 μL probe solution to a cleaned glass slide and invert sample coverslip onto the slide to create another sandwich (embryos facing the middle). Avoid creating bubbles. See Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/180-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Primary Probe Hybridization\n(A) Schematic of primary probe hybridization sandwich. Embryos on the round coverslip are inverted onto a droplet of probe in hybridization buffer.\n(B) Image of inverted coverslip on glass slide.\n(C) Image of humid heat block with slide-embryo-coverslip sandwich.\n(D and E) Image of sample coverslip assembled in the Bioptechs chamber and mounted on the microscope for imaging.\nIncubate at 20°C–23°C for 10 min in a light-protected humid chamber.",
    "Transfer sandwich onto the surface of an 80°C humid heat block, on top of a water droplet, and cover with a light-protected box for 10 min.\nNote: A simple humid heat block can be created using a dry bath that holds two removable heating blocks. Invert one block to create a smooth surface to place the sample, and fill the tube holes of the second block with water to humidify the environment when the entire two-block area is covered with a light-protected box.\nTransfer the sample to a light-protected humid chamber and incubate at 37°C for 16 h.\nNote: This hybridization time can be extended to at least 48 h to improve signal strength.\nDislodge the coverslip from the slide carefully by submerging the sandwich in 2× SSC and allowing the coverslip to float off.\nWash for 1 h in pre-warmed 2× SSC/50% formamide at 37°C.\nWash 2 × 30 min in pre-warmed 2× SSC at 37°C.\nWash 2 × 30 min in pre-warmed 0.5× SSC at 37°C.\nOptional: Post-fix the sample in 1% PFA/PBS/0.05% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 20°C–23°C. This additional fixation step could be helpful if the primary probes have shorter homology lengths, or to preserve the sample if you observe some degradation after numerous secondary hybridization rounds. We have not observed any degradation of C. elegans embryos with up to 20 rounds.\nStore the sample coverslip in 2× SSC at 4°C for as little time as possible before imaging. Fluorescent signal is strongest if the washes are performed the same day as imaging.\nSequential FISH\nPrimary FISH probes are imaged followed by secondary probe hybridizations and imaging. See Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/180-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Overview of Chromosome Tracing",
    "(A) Schematic of sequential FISH protocol. First, primary probes are imaged to define the volume occupied by the entire genomic stretch (e.g., chromosome territory, magenta). Second, primary probe fluorescent signal is removed by photo-bleaching or other means. Third, secondary hybridization and imaging commences. Secondary rounds are separated with signal removal steps.\n(B) Image of a microfluidics system (green arrow) coupled to the sample chamber (magenta arrow) mounted on a wide-field inverted microscope (Nikon Ti2).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/180-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. UREA PAGE Verification of Primary Probe Pool\nATTO565-labeled primary probe pools were run on gel to confirm their size and purity after amplification and purification. Samples in lanes 1–6 were amplified from the same 102 nt oligo pool template in independent reactions.\nNote: Use multiple spectrally distinct fluorophores in a single secondary hybridization round to detect more than one target in a round. This will increase the multiplexing and decrease the total experiment time, but requires correction for chromatic aberration.\nIncubate sample with nuclear stain.\nDilute the DAPI Stock Solution 1:1000 in 2× SSC.\nFilter the stain to remove dye aggregates using a 0.2 μm syringe filter.\nAdd stain to completely cover the sample. Protect the sample from light and incubate at 20°C–23°C for 2–10 min.\nWash 2 × 1 min with 2× SSC.\nAssemble the Bioptechs sample chamber according to the manufacturer’s instructions and add 100 μL fiducial beads solution to the flow channel.\nNote: Since the beads will begin to stick to the plastic tube surface, prepare the fiducial bead dilution at this point, not earlier. The optimal dilution should be determined empirically to result in 5–10 beads adhered to the coverslip per field of view. Vortex the bead stock and dilution thoroughly immediately prior to pipetting.",
    "Invert the sample onto the channel (embryos facing beads solution in the channel) and seal the chamber as tightly as possible. Ensure there are no leaks in the chamber and clean the coverslip surface with isopropanol.\nPrepare a glass microscope slide with well-separated 100 nm TetraSpeck beads to calibrate the microscope and computationally register the channels if more than one channel is used for imaging secondary probes.\nCapture a ∼10 μm z-stack of the TetraSpeck beads in the channels used for FISH probes. A field of view containing ∼20 beads is suitable.\nPrepare ∼2.5 mL of each secondary hybridization solution with the appropriate fluorescent probe(s) at 8 nM final concentration. Multiple targets can be visualized in a single hybridization round if unique fluorophores are combined.\nFlush all tubes of the flow system with freshly prepared 2× SSC. Ensure there are no bubbles in the fluid-handling tubing and that the flow rate is constant (0.6 mL/min).\nReplace the storage buffers for each flow system position with the appropriate secondary hybridization solution, imaging buffer, or washing buffer.\nAttach the sample chamber to the flow system and wash with imaging buffer for 2 min.\nChoose multiple fields of view (FOVs) containing embryos of interest with strong primary probe signal and 5–10 well-separated fiducial beads.\nIn the first round of imaging the FOVs, capture z-stacks of the entire embryo in the DAPI, bead, and primary probe channels.\nOptional: If the fluorescent signal is weak, and/or fewer than ∼100 probes are used per target, consider alternative imaging buffers to boost the probe signal (Moffitt et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nPhoto-bleach each FOV in the probe channel until FISH signal is undetectable.",
    "Note: The time of bleaching is dependent on the strength of the illumination source. This parameter should be empirically determined on each microscopy system. For example, photo-bleaching with a 1 W laser at full power is typically complete in 30–40 s, while an LED may take 2–3 times longer.\nExchange the imaging chamber buffer for the first secondary hybridization solution by flowing this solution through the chamber for 3 min. Let the sample incubate for 10–30 min to allow the secondary probes to anneal to their targets.\nWash the sample in the chamber by flowing washing buffer for 3 min.\nExchange the wash buffer for imaging buffer for 2 min.\nCapture z-stacks of all FOVs in the bead and probe channels.\nPhoto-bleach each FOV in the probe channels until FISH signal is undetectable.\nOptional: The secondary bleaching steps may be replaced with alternative chemical cleavage (Moffitt et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) or strand-displacement methods (Mateo et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) to remove probe signal.\nRepeat steps 35–39 for all remaining secondary hybridization rounds."
