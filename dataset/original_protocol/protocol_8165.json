    "All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California San Francisco and were conducted in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n1. Collect lumbar DRG from experimental mice\nBefore starting the experiment, prepare the working solution of the density gradient medium (e.g., Percoll) by mixing 9 volumes of the medium with 1 volume of Ca++/Mg++-free 10x HBSS. Keep it on ice.\nAnesthetize the mouse with 2.5% Avertin. Confirm that the animal is fully anesthetized by the lack of response to the hind paw pinch.\nNOTE: Both male and female mice aged 6-8 weeks were used.\nPerfuse the mouse transcardially with 10 mL of pre-chilled 1x PBS.\n\t\nPlace the mouse in the supine position with four paws secured with the tape inside a chemical fume hood. Lift the skin below the rib cage by the forceps, and make a small incision with surgical scissors to expose the liver and diaphragm.\nContinue to use scissors to cut the diaphragm and the rib cage, open the pleural cavity to expose the beating heart.\nQuickly cut the right atrial appendage with iris scissors. Once the bleeding is noted, insert a 30 G needle into the posterior end of the left ventricle, and slowly inject 10 mL of pre-chilled 1x PBS to perfuse the animal.\nPerform dorsal laminectomy15 on the mouse placed at the prone position.\n\tNOTE: If cell culture is planned, spray the mouse with 70% ethanol before incision and use pre-sterilized surgical instruments for dissection.\n\t\nUse a size 11 scalpel to make one longitudinal lateral deep incisions starting from the thoracic region down to the sacral region. Remove the skin by the scissors to expose the dorsal muscle layer.",
    "Use Friedman-Pearson Rongeur to peel off the connective tissues and muscles until the lumbosacral spine processes and bilateral transverse processes are exposed.\nUse a Noyes Spring Scissor to carefully open the dorsal spinal column, then switch to a Friedman-Pearson Rongeur to remove the vertebral bones to expose the spinal cord with intact spinal nerves attached.\nCarefully dissect ipsilateral and contralateral lumbar DRG (L4/L5 DRG in our study) and place it into 1 mL of ice-cold Ca++/Mg++-free 1x HBSS in a Dounce tissue homogenizer. Now the tissues are ready for step 2.\n\tNOTE: Trim the spinal nerve attached to the DRG if possible.\n2. Isolate single cells from mouse lumbar DRG\nHomogenize the DRG tissue with a loose pestle in the Dounce homogenizer 20-25 times.\nPlace a sterile 70 μm nylon cell strainer in a sterile 50 mL conical tube. Wet the cell strainer with 800 μL of ice-cold 1x HBSS, and the flow-through is collected in the conical tube.\nCollect the homogenized tissue suspension from the homogenizer using a pipette and pass through the wet 70 μm nylon cell strainer into the 50 mL conical tube.\nRinse the homogenizer twice with 800 μL of ice-cold 1x HBSS and then decant into the same 50 mL conical tube with cell strainer to increase the yield.\nAdd 1.5 mL of equilibrated ice-cold isotonic density gradient medium (prepared in step 1.1) into a sterile 5-mL polystyrene FACS tube.\nTransfer the cell homogenate from the 50 mL conical tube (in step 2.4) into the FACS tube, mix well with the density gradient medium by pipetting up and down. Add an additional 500 μL of 1x HBSS to seal the top.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 800 x g for 20 min at 4 °C.",
    "Carefully aspirate the supernatant containing myelin in the medium without disturbing the cell pellet at the bottom of the FACS tube.\nResuspend the cells in PBS or FACS buffer containing 5% Fetal bovine serum (FBS) for FACS analysis.\n\tNOTE: At least 50,000 to 100,000 cells are expected from L4 /L5 DRG of one mouse.\n\t\nResuspend the mechanically isolated DRG cells (L4/L5) in 100 μL of PBS containing 5% Fetal Bovine Serum and then incubate with α-mouse CX3CR1-APC antibody (1:2,000) in the dark at 4 °C for 1 h.\nWash the cells with 5 mL of PBS once; centrifuge the cells 360 x g for 8 min at 4 °C.\nAspirate the supernatant, then resuspend the cell pellet in 300 μL of PBS for FCAS analysis. If cell sorting is planned, resuspend the cells in the FACS buffer instead.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
