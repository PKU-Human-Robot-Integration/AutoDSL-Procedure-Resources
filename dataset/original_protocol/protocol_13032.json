    "1. Incubation with debranching enzymes\nMix 200 µL of purified glycogen at 0.5-2 mg/mL with 200 µL of 100 mM of acetate buffer (pH 4.8). Add 2 µL of isoamylase (180 U/mg of protein) and 1.5 µL of pullulanase (30 U/mg of protein) (see Table of Materials), mix gently by pipetting up and down, and incubate at 42 °C for 16 h in a 1.5 mL tube.\n\tNOTE: Degradation or amylase contamination might occur during the glycogen purification process. To appreciate the presence of free malto-oligosaccharides, samples can be incubated without the debranching enzyme cocktail in parallel. A standard (e.g., maltoheptaose) is included in the analysis to determine the relationship between the elution time and the degree of polymerization.\nStop the reactions by incubating at 95 °C for 5 min.\nCentrifuge at 16,100 x g for 5 min at room temperature to pellet and remove any insoluble material.\nRemove the supernatants using a pipette and transfer them to new annotated tubes. Desalt the supernatants by adding the equivalent of 100 µL of anion/cation exchange resin beads (AG-501-X8, see Table of Materials) and agitate.\n\t\nRegularly agitate the beads for 5 min. Collect the samples by pipetting and place them in new annotated tubes.\nFreeze-dry or use a vacuum evaporator set up (see Table of Materials) at 30 °C to dry the samples.\nStore dried samples at room temperature or at -20 °C.\n\t​NOTE: The samples can be stored for 1 month.\n2. Reductive amination\nMix the dried samples with 2 µL of 1 M sodium cyanoborohydride in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 2 µL of APTS (5 mg of APTS resuspended in 48 µL of 15% acetic acid) (see Table of Materials).\nIncubate at 42 °C for 16 h in the dark.",
    "​CAUTION: Sodium cyanoborohydride is handled with adapted personal protection equipment and under a chemical hood. Inhalation and contact with skin are highly toxic and can be fatal, causing severe skin burns and eye damage. Highly toxic gases can be generated when mixing sodium cyanoborohydride with acetic acid. In contact with water, sodium cyanoborohydride releases flammable gases, which may ignite spontaneously. Concentrated samples are handled under a chemical hood and using adapted personal protection equipment starting from this step.\n3. FACE analysis\nAdd 46 µL of ultrapure water to each sample.\nDilute the samples directly to 1/50 in micro vials of 100 µL by adding 1 µL of the sample to 49 µL of ultrapure water. Keep the samples in the dark while setting the FACE (5-10 min).\nPerform reverse polarity electrophoresis with a capillary electrophoresis instrument with a laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detector (see Table of Materials). Set the polarity to \"reverse mode\" for separation, set the LIF at 488 nm emission wavelength and the detector at 512 nm.\nSet the Injection time for 10 s and the injection pressure at 0.5 psi.\nCarry out the APTS-labelled-glucans separation at 30 kV in a bare fused silica capillary of 60.2 cm in length with an inner diameter of 50 µm (375 µm outer diameter) in the N-linked carbohydrate separation buffer diluted to 1/3 in ultrapure water (see Table of Materials).\n\t​NOTE: The N-linked carbohydrate separation buffer is replaced every 20 runs.\n4. DATA processing\nExport the \".ASC \"and \".CDF \"files containing the electropherogram profile and integration data, respectively.\nOpen the .ASC file and draw the relative fluorescence unit according to the time chart.\nOpen the .CDF file, proceed with a first automatic integration and adjust the following parameters: width; valley to valley integration; minimum area.",
