    "Artificial cerebro-spinal fluid (aCSF) For the preparation, see explanation in the Recipes section below. Once prepared, place a beaker containing aCSF in an ice bucket throughout experience. Dissection and isolation of the brainstem-spinal cordPlace a neonatal rat (0-2 days old) in an induction chamber for inhalational anesthesia. Animal is anesthetized with 4% isoflurane until the loss of reflex responsiveness to tail pinching (during 7 to 10 min). Using a scalpel, swiftly euthanize the animal by decapitation (incision must be performed in front of the ears) (Figure 1b). This allows decerebration just rostrally to the fifth cranial nerves.Remove the skin and muscles covering the back with forceps and scissors (Figure 1c).Transfer the preparation into a dissection chamber filled with aCSF at 4 Â°C and insert needle in each fore- and hind-limb to hold the preparation (slightly stretched) with the dorsal surface upwards (Figure 1d). Under binocular microscope, hold and lift up the skull bones with fine forceps. Using small scissors, cut the skull bones on both sides in order to expose the brainstem (Figure 1e).Using the same procedure along vertebral column, cut each vertebra on both sides to expose the spinal cord (dorsal laminectomy) (Figure 1f). Turn the preparation over in order to maintain its ventral surface upwards (Figure 1g).Hold and lift up the skull bones with fine forceps (Figure 1h) and cut all ventral and dorsal spinal roots leaving as much length as possible. The inset in Figure 1h shows how the skin, muscles and bones are removed to allow laminectomy to be performed. To avoid damage of brainstem and/or spinal cord, it is crucial to never hold nervous tissue with forceps.",
    "Using a spoon, carefully transfer the brainstem-spinal cord with its ventral and dorsal spinal roots still attached in a 10 ml recording chamber containing circulating aCSF (flow rate, 3-5 ml/min adjusted with the peristaltic pump) (Figure 1i).In order to ensure mechanical stability, the preparation is pinned down with its ventral surface upward by several pins inserted through the meninges surrounding the brainstem and the spinal cord. To assess the quality of the procedure, motor output activity in spinal ventral roots is recorded with glass suction electrodes filled with aCSF solution (Figure 2a). Signals (burst of action potentials) are amplified (10,000 times) by differential AC amplifiers (low cutoff, 100 Hz; high cutoff, 1 kHz), digitized and acquired via an analogical/digital interface, and finally stored on a computer. The dissection is successful when motor activities are spontaneously generated by the isolated preparation (Figures 2b-2c).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161109/20161109013605_3781.jpgFigure 1.

When required, the recording chamber is partitioned either 2 or 3 compartments with barriers of syringe-ejected Vaseline to permit differential exposure of selected spinal cord regions to pharmacological treatment. b. Simultaneous recordings are made from the 4th cervical (C4) and the 1st lumbar (L1) ventral roots.",
    "Respiratory-like rhythm is spontaneously generated, showing clear inspiratory (Insp) C4 and pre-inspiratory/expiratory (pre-I; Exp) L1 alternated phases. c. Blind techniques (with sharp or patch electrodes) were used to record rhythmic activity of brainstem and spinal respiratory neurons. Here, the firing of the impaled neuron is in synchrony with L1 ventral root discharge and therefore is identified as an expiratory motoneuron (MN)."
