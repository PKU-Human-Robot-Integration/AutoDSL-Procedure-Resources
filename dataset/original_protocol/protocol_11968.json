    "The animal procedures described in this article were approved by the National Cancer Institute at Bethesda Animal Care and Use Committee, and conform to the policies contained within The Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, The Animal Welfare Act, and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n1. Cell Preparation\nHarvesting bone marrow nucleated cell (BMNC)\n\t\nUse only sterile materials. Sterilize re-usable instruments using a steam autoclave. Purchase needles, syringes, and plastic ware in single use sterile containers. Perform all animal and cell manipulations in a Class II, Type A2 Biological Safety Cabinet.\nPrepare BMNCs in a 14 mL round bottom tube containing 3 mL of HF2 (Hank's balanced salt solution supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum).\nEuthanize C57Bl6 donor mice (positive for CD45 allele CD45.2), age typically 2-6 months, using a CO2 chamber.\nSterilize the mouse carcass by spraying 70% ethanol over the entire body with a spray bottle. Peel the skin from the legs, from the pelvis down to the ankle.\nRemove the femora and tibiae from the carcass using sterile scissors (straight, sharp/sharp, 11.5 cm) and forceps (Graefe, serrated, 0.8-mm tip width). Trim attached muscles clearly.\nCut the proximal and distal ends of the tibia with the scissors. Holding the tibia with forceps, insert a 27-gauge 3 mL syringe containing 2.5 mL of HF2 into the tibial marrow cavity at the distal end of the tibia (ankle). Flush the bone marrow cells from the tibia using gentle pressure into the 14 mL round bottom tube.\n\t\t\nRepeat for the other tibia.",
    "Cut the proximal and distal ends of the femur with scissors. Flush the femur marrow cavity by inserting a 20-gauge needle attached to a 3 mL syringe containing 2.5 mL of HF2 into the distal end of the femur marrow cavity and applying gentle pressure to the syringe.\n\t\t\nRepeat for the other femur, collecting all bone marrow from both tibiae and femora in the same 14 mL round bottom tube.\nDisperse the marrow mass by aspirating up and down several times with the same 20-gauge needle attached to the 3 mL syringe.\nAntibody staining of BMNC\n\t\nCount BMNC. Add 20 µL of a 3% acetic acid solution to 20 µL of the BMNC suspension generated in step 1.1.8. Then, count using a hemocytometer and an inverted microscope.\nPellet the BMNC by gentle centrifugation at 450 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Resuspend the pellet with HF2 using 90 µL per 107 cells and add 10 µL of biotinylated anti-lineage antibody cocktail to the cell suspension.\nAfter incubating for 20 min at 4 °C, wash the stained cells with 3 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nResuspend the BMNC with 100 µL of HF2 per 107 cells. Add 2 µL of allophycocyanin (APC) conjugated anti-biotin antibody to the cell suspension, followed by incubation at 4 °C for 20 min.\nRinse the stained BMNC with 3 mL of PBS and resuspend the BMNC with HF2 supplemented with 0.2 µg/mL of propidium iodide (PI) for flow cytometry cell sorting.\nFlow cytometry cell sorting of BMNC\n\t\nCalibrate flow cytometry cell sorter. Optimize all photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), scatter, and fluorescence parameters using unstained cells and set within the linear range of each detector.\nPrepare unstained, PI-stained, and APC labeled lineage cocktail cells in parallel from step 1.2. Analyze for spectral compensation.",
    "Discriminate doublet cells by sequential gating of FSC-H vs. SSC-H, 640-SSC-A vs. 640-SSC-H, and 640-SSC-S vs. 640-SSC-W.\nExclude nonviable cells using PI excited at 561 nm and emission collected with a 614/20 band pass filter. Excite lineage APC labeled cells at 640 nm and collect emission with a 671/30 band pass filter.\nRecord fluorescence values as voltage height and collect at least 100,000 events in list mode data files to visualize the populations to be sorted.\nCalculate spectral compensation after acquiring three samples of 10,000 cells for the following: unlabeled cells, PI labeled cells, and anti-lineage antibody cocktail conjugated with APC labeled cells.\nSet three regions to sort Lineage negative (LN), Lineage positive (LP) with dim fluorescence intensity (LP1), and LP population with bright fluorescence (LP2) into 5 mL tubes containing 0.5 mL of 10% FBS media.\nSort cells using a one drop envelop and purify abort mode.\nPerform post sort analysis with 1,000 total cells on each sorted sample to confirm the purity and viability of the sorted cells.\nCollect sorted cells by centrifugation at 450 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspend cell pellet with 0.5 mL of HF2.\nConfirm sorted cell number with hemocytometer and Trypan blue. Adjust cell number with HF2 for transplantation.\n\t\tNOTE: A wide spectrum of BMNC populations can be isolated for transplantation using additional combinations of fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies in step 1.2.2 above.\n2. Recipient Mice Preparation and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)\nPreparation of transplant recipients\n\t\nMaintain veterinary and husbandry care of congenic recipient mice (B6-LY5.1/Cr, CD45.1) in a specific pathogen free (SPF) animal facility.\nFor prophylactic decontamination of the gastrointestinal track, provide sterile water containing 100 mg/L of ciprofloxacin to the recipients for 7 days prior to lethal dose (9 Gy) irradiation, and maintain for 14 days following irradiation.",
    "Provide a lethal dose (9 Gy) irradiation from a Cs source as follows. Use a trained, certified Cs operator. Set the Cs source instrument to deliver 70 cGy/min total body gamma irradiation. Place 10 mice in a custom-designed holder and insert the holder into the irradiator chamber. Deliver 9 Gy total body irradiation in 13 min and return the mice to their cages.\nHematopoietic stem cell transplantation\n\t\nMix wild type (WT) BMNC from a congenic recipient mouse (B6-LY5.1/Cr, CD45.1) at a cell dose of 2 x 105 cells per mouse with 2 to 5 x 104 cells of the purified test BMNC prepared with flow cytometry sorting as described in 1.3 above. Mix cells in the same syringe.\n\t\tNOTE: The WT BMNC provide a radiation sparing-effect to the recipient mouse and allow for the survival of the recipient mouse if the test cells do not support hematopoiesis. The WT BMNC used in this type of experiment express the CD45.1 allele, and thus can be distinguished from the test cells using antibodies which discriminate between CD45.1 and CD45.2. The WT BM cells are referred to as \"helper cells\", \"radiation-sparing cells\", or \"competitor cells\".\nAdjust the cell mixture volume to 200 µL per recipient using sterile HF2 for facilitating the injection.\nTransplant the cell mixtures to the lethally irradiated recipient mice via intravenous tail vein injection using a 1 mL syringe and 28-gauge needle, within 24 h of irradiation. Place the mouse tail under a heat lamp, as heat leads to tail vein dilation.\n\t\tNOTE: Euthanize all the recipient mice at the end of the study and evaluate the disease progression by necropsy, histology, and flow cytometry.\n3. Engraftment Assay using Flow Cytometry",
    "To evaluate donor cell engraftment, collect peripheral blood (PB) from the recipient mice at 6th week, 12th week, and 16th week after transplantation.\nWarm the recipients in the cage with heat lamp for about 1 min and place mouse into a restrainer.\nCut the tail vein with a scalpel (blade 10, #3 scalpel handle) and collect 100 µL of PB per recipient using a microcapillary tube containing EDTA as an anticoagulant.\nDivide the collected PB into two equal aliquots by placing 50 µL in a sterile microcentrifuge tube. Use one aliquot for an automated complete blood count (CBC) (performed at the NCI Histopathology Core) and use the second aliquot for antibody staining and flow cytometry.\nTo detect donor engraftment by flow cytometry, lyse the red blood cells (RBC) by adding 1 mL of hypotonic RBC lysis buffer (8.29 g/L of NH4Cl, 1 g/L of KHCO3, 0.037 g/L of Na2EDTA, pH 7.2) to 50 µL of the collected PB. Vortex the sample to mix and incubate 10 min at room temperature.\nCentrifuge the lysed PB at 4,600 x g for 1.5 min. Carefully aspirate the supernatant and discard.\nPartially disrupt the cell pellet by gently tapping or \"flicking\" the bottom of the tube. Add 1.3 mL of PBS into the pellet located in tube and centrifuge at 4,600 x g for 1.5 min. Carefully aspirate and discard the supernatant.\nDisrupt the cell pellet by tapping or flicking, and add 200 µL of HF2 supplemented with 5% rat serum to the cell pellet.\nAdd anti-CD45.2 antibody (1 µL) conjugated with allophycocyanin (APC) to the cell suspension. Incubate at 4 °C for at least 30 min, and briefly vortex the mixture.",
    "After the staining, wash the cells twice as described above, and resuspend with 400 µL of HF2 supplemented with 1 µg/mL of PI.\nDetect engraftment using a 4-color flow cytometer. Obtain additional information on cell types within the peripheral blood by adding additional antibodies to detect specific cell types, such as B or T lymphocytes.\nRecord serial engraftment data using a spread sheet to allow for further analysis of data.\nSubscription Required.
