    "All of the experimental procedures in animal studies were approved by the Research Ethics Committee at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and adhered to the ARVO statement for use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research.\n1. Ex vivo wound healing model of the mouse corneal epithelium\nPreparation of the mice\n\t\nAdminister general anesthesia to C57BL/6 mice by intraperitoneal delivery of ketamine hydrochloride (80-100 mg/kg of body weight) and xylazine (5-10 mg/kg of body weight). \nEnsure that general anesthesia is working by confirming loss of movement to a noxious stimulus and loss of righting reflex in mice.\nFix the mice head by hand and apply topical anesthesia on both eyes with one drop of 0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (Figure 1A). Disinfect the ocular surface and lids three times with 5% betadine. \nCreation of murine corneal epithelial wound model\n\tNOTE: Perform the below procedures under a stereomicroscope. The corneal wound was created in vivo, not ex vivo, to manipulate the eyeball better and close to the real-world situation. This is a terminal procedure; therefore, only clean instruments (not sterile technique) are required. \n\t\nMark the central cornea of the mouse using a skin biopsy punch (2 mm in diameter) to confirm a well-circumscribed and well-measurable area of the wound.\nGently indent the punch over the central cornea to leave a circular mark (Figure 1B). Utilizing a hand-held corneal rust ring remover with a 0.5 mm burr, debride the corneal epithelium down to the Bowman's layer ensuring not to damage the latter (Figure 1C). Remove the residual, loose tissues inner to the wound margin with corneal forceps.",
    "Confirm the area of debridement with fluorescein staining (Figure 1D). To perform fluorescein staining, put a drop of normal saline onto a fluorescein paper to dissolve fluorescein, and then place the fluorescein-containing drop onto murine epithelial defect for visualizing it under Cobalt blue light.\nEx vivo culture of the murine corneal abrasion wound model.\n\t\nFor harvesting the murine eyeballs, proceed as follows.\nSacrifice the mice by cervical dislocation after inducing anesthesia with 5% isoflurane in an induction chamber. Ensure that anesthesia is working by confirming the loss of movement to a noxious stimulus and loss of righting reflex in mice.\nGently press with the tip of forceps at the superior and inferior orbital rims to push the eyeball out. Introduce the tip of the closed corneal scissors into the retrobulbar space along the inferior orbital wall, ensuring not to penetrate the eyeball.\nHold the eyeball steady with 0.3 mm corneal forceps, and then cut off the optic nerve and periorbital soft tissue with corneal scissors to isolate the eyeball.\nFor ex vivo culturing of murine eyeballs, proceed as follows.\nPrepare a 48-well plate with melted wax inside the well and wait for solidification. With the tip of conjunctiva forceps, create a round hole on the surface of solidified wax for accommodating the eyeballs.\nPlace the harvested eyeballs directly onto the 48-well plate (Figure 1E) with wax-covered bottoms and sidewalls to establish stabilization (Figure 1F).\nCulture the eyeballs with Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) containing 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C with or without antibiotics, depending on the purpose of the study.",
    "NOTE: If the model is used for studying corneal epithelial wound healing, antibiotics would be required to prevent infection. However, if this model is used to evaluate the efficacy of antibiotics or mixed agents, prophylactic antibiotics would not be necessary.\nImmerse the ocular surface with the culture medium without causing the eyeball to float.\nDocument the course of wound healing by fluorescein staining (step 1.2.3) and collecting photographs with a digital camera under Cobalt blue light.\n\t\t​NOTE: In prospective experiments with mice models of mechanical corneal injury, those receiving corneal abrasion and tested further for the efficacy of therapeutic agents are viewed as an experimental group, and those receiving corneal abrasion without further treatment are regarded as a negative control group.\n2. In vivo rabbit model of corneal alkali injury\nNOTE: In this model, an alkali burn injury is induced followed by mechanical debridement of the corneal epithelium to generate a well-defined and even wound area for subsequent quantification. Sterilize all instruments before use.\nPreparation of the rabbit with pre-operative analgesia, including intramuscular injection of systemic analgesics and topical eye drops.\n\t\nAdminister general anesthesia to New Zealand white rabbits by intramuscular injection of ketamine hydrochloride (35-44 mg/kg of body weight), mixed with xylazine (5-10 mg/kg of body weight) at the hind leg.\nAfter positioning the rabbit and covering it with a towel, apply topical anesthesia over the right eye with a drop of 0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (Figure 2A) under a stereomicroscope. Disinfect the ocular surface and lids three times with 5% betadine.\nInducing alkali burn injury over the cornea",
    "Place circular filter papers with a diameter of 8 mm (cut using an 8 mm punch) in a Petri dish. Using a dropper, add 0.5 N sodium hydroxide (NaOH) into the Petri dish to soak the filter papers. Drain excess NaOH solution from the filter papers before placing them onto the rabbit cornea.\n\t\tCAUTION: 0.5 N NaOH may cause severe erosive injury to human tissues. Wear gloves when handling. If the skin or the eyes come in contact with NaOH droplets, irrigation with copious amounts of normal saline and medical help are required to reduce further damage.\nAfter opening the eyelids with a lid speculum and confirming that the rabbit nictitating membrane is not interfering with the insertion of filter paper (Figure 2B), place the circular filter paper soaked in 0.5 N NaOH onto the central cornea for 30 s, and then remove it with forceps (Figure 2C).\nAfter removing the filter paper, rinse the ocular surface with 10 mL of normal saline to wash out alkali material.\nCompleting corneal epithelial defect\n\t\nDebride the corneal epithelium within the opacified area down to the Bowman's membrane using a corneal rust ring remover with a 0.5 mm burr (Figure 2D).\nConfirm the area of debridement with fluorescein staining under the Cobalt blue light and remove residual corneal epithelium using corneal forceps (Figure 2E).\nSecure wound condition with tarsorrhaphy\n\t\nConfirm that the nictitating membrane smoothly covers the ocular surface and corneal epithelial defect at the nasal side. Ensure that the nictitating membrane is not folded or distorted too much to interfere with the process of wound healing and the experiment.",
    "Perform a temporary tarsorrhaphy with or without topical agents using a 6-0 suture to protect the ocular surface and prevent the rabbit from scratching it (Figure 2F). Ensure that the suture for tarsorrhaphy is at 3-4 mm from upper and lower lid margins with 4-5 ties and longer knots to prevent the rabbit from breaking the sutures.\n\t\tNOTE: If the experiment is not involved in an antibiotics study, topical agents with antibiotics could be considered.\nIn this rabbit model, those receiving alkali burn and removal of corneal epithelium were regarded as the control group.\n\t\tNOTE: In prospective experiments, the rabbits receiving alkali burn corneal injury and further treated with therapeutic agents is viewed as an experimental group. The rabbits receiving alkali burn treatment only, without further treatment, are regarded as a negative control group.\nPost-operative analgesia and pain control\n\t\nAssess the physiological condition and USDA pain levels for 7 days after the procedure, by monitoring pain and distress in the animals. Consider the use of tobramycin ointment and one drop of 0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution according to the result of the assessment. Administer Buprenorphine HCl (0.03 mg/kg) every 6-8 hours for 3 days.\n\t\tNOTE: For daily measurement of defect area and observation after surgery, the procedure belongs to USDA category D.\nSubscription Required.
