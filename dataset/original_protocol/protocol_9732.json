    "1. High throughput generation of spheroids with incorporated O2-sensitive probe\nPreparing micro-patterned agarose coated tissue culture plate\n\tNOTE: Micro-patterned agarose coated tissue culture plates are used for simultaneous generation of a high number of spheroids (1585 per PDMS stamp, see Table of Materials) for bioprinting and other applications, where multiple experimental replicates or large spheroid numbers are needed.\n\t\nPrepare all sterile materials and instruments (spatulas and tweezers) by autoclaving where possible or by filter sterilization. Clean the recyclable PDMS stamps33 from agarose and store them aseptically in 70% ethanol. Do this at least 1 day prior to spheroid generation.\nTransfer micro-patterned PDMS stamps from a storage vial to a sterile Petri dish and air-dry with the smooth surface up under the sterile laminar airflow conditions for 10 min.\nPut each stamp with a micro-patterned surface up (and smooth surface down) in the middle of the well of a 12-well sterile tissue culture plate. Air dry for 1-2 min with an open lid.\n\t\tNOTE: It is highly important to evaporate the excess liquid as only dry stamps perfectly stick to the plastic surface and remain attached during the procedure.\nWeigh 1.5 g of agarose into a clean 200 mL glass bottle, add 50 mL of sterile distilled water, cover with a lid and melt in a microwave to make 50 mL of 3% homogeneous agarose solution.\n\t\tCAUTION: The agarose solution is extremely hot and has to be handled with caution. If shaken immediately after the melting procedure, the hot agarose solution can start bubbling and burst out of the vessel. To avoid occasional traumas, use sufficiently large vessels filled with maximum 50% of the volume with the agarose solution.",
    "Using a sterile serological pipette immediately add ~2 mL of hot agarose solution to each well of the 12-well cell culture plates to completely cover the inserted PDMS stamp. Leave the agarose to solidify for 20 min by incubating under the sterile air-flow with the plate lid opened.\n\t\tNOTE: The agarose layer should be at least two times thicker than the PDMS stamp to ensure the integrity of the agarose microwells after the PDMS stamp removal (Figure 1C).\nUsing a sterile small spatula, accurately turn the agarose with the embedded PDMS stamp upside down in each well to have the smooth stamp surface up. Add ~200 µL of sterile water on the smooth topside of the stamp, gently detach it from the agarose with a spatula, and remove it from the well. Avoid damaging the microwells.\nAdd 1 mL of corresponding sterile cell culture media to the agarose stamps for direct use. Cover the plate with the lid and incubate overnight at 4 °C. Use PBS solution (instead of medium) for long-term storage (up to 2 weeks at 4 °C). Do not let the agarose dry. Before use, warm the agarose micro-patterned plates for 1 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator.\n\t\tNOTE: Incubation is needed to equilibrate and remove air bubbles from agarose microwells. Proceed with protocol step 1.2.\nPreparing O2 probe-loaded spheroids\n\t\nUse α-minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and growth factors supplemented endothelial cell growth medium 2 for the cultivation of hDPSC and HUVEC cell lines, respectively. Prepare hDPSC / HUVEC heterocellular spheroid growth medium by adding HUVEC and hDPSC growth media in a 1:1 ratio.\nPrepare 70%-90% confluent cell culture (~3-4 days of preparation). For generation of heterocellular spheroids, prepare hDPSC and HUVEC cultures respectively.",
    "NOTE: The passage number of HUVEC and hDPSC must not exceed 8. To ensure rapid growth of cell cultures always split at 1/3 of the total cell culture (at 70%-80% confluency) using a new flask every 3 to 4 days.\nRinse 70%-90% confluent cell culture with prewarmed (37 °C) PBS (10 mL per 75 cm2 flask). Add dissociating enzyme solution (0.05% trypsin and 1 mM EDTA; 1 mL per 75 cm2 flask) and incubate for 3-5 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% humidity for cell detachment and check cell detachment under the microscope. Once done, neutralize trypsin with complete cell culture media containing 10% FBS (5 mL of media per 1 mL of dissociation solution).\n\t\tNOTE: Prevent overexposure of cells to the dissociating enzyme solution as this can affect their viability.\nFor HUVEC cultured in a low FBS medium, perform trypsin neutralization by adding 0.5 mL of 100% FBS to the trypsin-treated cell culture, followed by centrifugation to transfer cells to their growth medium.\n\t\tNOTE: The obtained cell suspension(s) should contain ~1 million cells per 1 mL. If needed, an additional centrifugation step can be added to the protocol to concentrate cell suspension.\nDissociate cell aggregates by pipetting using a 1000 µL pipette tip on the top of a 10 mL serological pipette to obtain single-cell suspension. Use a counting chamber (Neubauer-type hemocytometer or alternatives) to count the number of cells per 1 mL of the cell suspension34. Dilute the cell suspension to 500,000 cells per mL. For heterocellular hDPSC / HUVEC in 1:1 spheroid ratio, add equal volumes of corresponding cell suspensions to have a final cell concentration of 500,000 cells per mL.",
    "NOTE: Variation of cell concentration in suspension added to a micro-patterned agarose stamp allows changing the average size of produced spheroids, which depends on a cell number per microwell of an agarose stamp. In the described set-up, spheroids of ~300 cells are generated from 1 mL containing 500,000 cells on an agarose stamp with 1585 microwells.\nAdd concentrated O2 probe (nanoparticles, 1 mg/mL stock) solution to the prepared cell suspension to a final concentration of 5 µg/mL.\n\t\tNOTE: Spheroid formation in the presence of O2-sensing nanoparticles provides efficient staining, which is preserved for a minimum of 5 days (Figure 1D). In contrast, staining of preformed multicellular spheroids with nanoparticles will be less efficient15.\nExchange 1 mL of old media in a micropatterned well of 12-well agarose-coated cell culture plates (see step 1.1.7) for 1 mL of the prepared cell suspension (500,000 cells per 1 mL, with 5 µg/mL O2 probe). Culture the spheroids in CO2 incubator for 2-5 days in the continuous presence of the O2 probe to ensure its loading during spheroid formation and compaction.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid excessive medium evaporation in spheroid culture. If required, carefully (do not disturb the spheroids in microwells) add 0.2-0.5 mL of culture media with the additional O2 probe dilution.\nAfter the spheroid formation, exchange the growth media with a fresh one without the probe. The probe staining will be preserved in generated spheroids for 7-14 days or longer, allowing for long-term monitoring of its signals in spheroids.\n2. Spheroids bioprinting\nNOTE: Spheroids are bioprinted in a methacrylamide-modified gelatin (GelMA) based bioink. Below is a description of the bioink ingredients, the procedure of bioink preparation, and bioprinting.\nBioink preparation",
    "Prepare a 10% (w/v) GelMA solution (2 mL) in medium under a laminar air-flow35 as follows: weigh 0.2 g of sterile GelMA with a degree of substitution of 78 in a 15 mL tube, add 1.9 mL of α-MEM and let it dissolve by mixing on a rotary shaker at 37 °C (~2 h).\n\t\tNOTE: Do not add the full amount of medium, because other compounds such as spheroids and photo-initiator Li-TPO-L will be added later.\nResuspend spheroids in the micropatterned wells by pipetting and collect them in a 15 mL tube. Perform an additional rinse with PBS to ensure that all spheroids are collected from the agarose microwells. Avoid touching/damaging the agarose microwells as flakes of agarose can block the needle during bioprinting.\nCollect spheroids by centrifugation in a 15 mL tube at 300 x g for 5 min at 20 °C. Aspirate the supernatant with a pipette, add 50 µL of medium to the spheroids and resuspend them by gentle pipetting.\nAdd the spheroid mixture to the warm GelMA solution and mix by gentle pipetting. Maintain the spheroid concentration to 6340-12860 spheroids (from 4-8 micropatterns) per mL of bioink for bioprinting. Avoid higher concentrations of spheroids as it easily causes blocking of the printing needle.\nAdd filter-sterilized photo-initiator Li-TPO-L stock solution (32 mg/mL) in a final concentration of 2 mol% with respect to the number of double bonds and mix by gentle pipetting36,37.\n\t\tNOTE: The amount of Li-TPO-L can be calculated according to the equation:\n\t\tVolume of photoinitiator (PI) = (0.000385 mol NH2- groups / g of GelMA x 294.10 g Li-TPO-L / mol x 0.78 x 0.02) / 0.032 g Li-TPO-L / mL x 0.2 g GelMA = 0.0107 mL Li-TPO-L stock\nBioprinting procedure",
    "See the steps in Supplementary Protocol 1 for design of scaffold in CAD. To bioprint the design, follow the steps below.\nClose the end of a sterile 3 cc cartridge with a tip cap (luer lock) and fill with bioink by pipetting. Insert a plunger in the cartridge. Hold the cartridge upside down and remove the tip cap, push the plunger toward the bioink until all air from the cartridge is removed.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid the contact between GelMA bioink and the sides of the cartridge, as this may inhibit the movement of the plunger due to gelation of the bioink.\nLet the bioink to cool down in the heating mantle of the bioprinter at 23 °C (20-30 min). Screw in a pressure adapter on the top of the cartridge. Close the clip on the inlet tube to prevent the bioink from leaking, mount a 22 G conical PE needle on the cartridge. Adapt the needle size and diameter to the scaffold design and spheroid diameter and concentration.\n\t\tNOTE: Wear a mouth mask and sprayed gloves to prevent contamination.\nSpray the bioprinter with 70% ethanol and wipe it dry with absorbing paper. Install the cartridge in the heating mantle on the extrusion based printhead. Plug the pressure inlet and open the clip on the inlet. Load the G-code file of your design into the printing software.\nStart needle length measurement. Regulate the printing pressure by dispensing a little bioink in a sterile Petri dish. A printing pressure of 0.025-0.045 MPa is typical for printing GelMA based bioinks38.",
    "Install a 6-well plate, open the well plate, close the hood, and start printing. After printing, let the scaffolds be physically crosslinked for 10 min at 5 °C and irradiate the printed scaffolds for 60 s with a UV LED lamp (365 nm; 500 mW according to the manufacturer).\n\t\tNOTE: UV crosslinking time depends on the properties of the UV light, photo-initiator type and concentration, the desired scaffold crosslinking degree, swelling, and elasticity modulus.\nImmediately add the corresponding growth media containing 100 U/mL of penicillin and 100 µg/mL of streptomycin (P/S) to all wells with bioprinted grids (2 mL per well of a 6-well cell culture plate).\nCulture in a 37 °C CO2 incubator until you start the microscopy. For bioprinted construct microscopy, transfer a printed waffle grid into a microscopy dish, cover with imaging media, and proceed with steps 3.2 and 3.3.\n\t\tNOTE: In the case of floating bioprinted constructs, they have to be fixed in the microscopy dish without an effect on cell viability, e.g., with cytocompatible glue. For inverted microscope transfer, the bioprint into a microscopy glass-bottom dish and cover with an imaging media (~200-500 µL, see the Note to step 3.1 for imaging media composition) to avoid undesired floating of the sample. Staining with additional fluorescent probes can be done in the cell culture dish prior to the transfer of bioprinted constructs to microscopy dishes (see step 3.1.6).\n3. Ratiometric fluorescence live microscopy of spheroid oxygenation in the biofabricated tissue\nNOTE: For converting the ratiometric intensity response (R) of the O2 probe into the actual hypoxia levels, the probe response has to be calibrated using procedures described in24. However, as the ratiometric calibration is instrument-specific and requires the installation of a T/O2/CO2-controlled incubator (not always available), the use of semi-quantitative ratio detection is the preferred option.",
    "Preparation of spheroids for live imaging analysis\n\t\nFor spheroid attachment during this step, pre-coat the sterile microscopy dishes with collagen IV and/or poly-D-lysine or use commercially available ones39. Check the compatibility of microscopy dishes with the working distance and other characteristics of the objective of your microscope.\n\t\tNOTE: In the case of multi-parameter imaging, all additional staining procedures have to be done in the culture plate dishes with sufficient amount of media protecting cells from evaporation, osmotic shock or other stress. Prepare and prewarm imaging medium prior to use: DMEM supplemented with sodium bicarbonate (1.2 g/L), HEPES-Na, pH 7.2 (10 mM), sodium pyruvate (1 mM), L-glutamine (2 mM), and glucose (5 mM), without phenol red.\nUsing a 1 mL pipette, gently wash out the O2-probe pre-stained spheroids from the agarose microwells. While the spheroids still float in the media, transfer them into a 15 mL conical bottom tube.\nTo ensure the collection of all spheroids from a micropatterned well, rinse the well 1 to 3 times with the additional 1 mL of culture media, combining all spheroid suspensions in one vial. Leave the vial in a vertical position for up to 10 min to let the spheroids settle down on the bottom of the vial forming a visible pellet.\nCarefully remove the media from the tube leaving the spheroids undisturbed. Gently resuspend them in the amount of fresh culture medium that will be sufficient for at least 20 spheroids per microscopy sample dish. This will minimize the usage of the culture media and simplify locating spheroids during imaging.",
    "NOTE: Use the autoclavable silicon part of µ-chamber 12-well plate (see Table of Materials) attached to the cover glass as a microscopy sample dish (24 x 60 mm, thickness #1) with a maximal media volume of 300 µL per well. The silicon part of this culture chamber can be sterilized and reused with any other plastic and glass surfaces when adhered to the dish.\nImmediately add equal volume of spheroid suspension to each microscopy dish/well. Leave the spheroids for 1 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator to attach to the surface of the microscopy dish. For oxygenation analysis coupled with the use of other dyes proceed with step 3.1.6. For simple oxygenation analysis proceed with step 3.1.7.\n\t\tNOTE: Insufficient incubation time (<1 h) can lead to occasional spheroid removal and loss during the media exchange, aborting your experiment. At the same time, over-incubation (>3 h) can lead to the partial or complete loss of their 3D organization due to migration of cells from spheroids to the microscopy dish surface and affecting their real-time oxygenation.\n(optional) Carefully exchange the medium with one containing fluorescent probe(s) diluted to staining concentration and continue incubation for an additional 1 h to reach optimal intensity. To avoid the removal of spheroids during media exchange, carefully aspirate the medium with a 200 µL pipette from the edges of the microscopy dishes and perform medium addition sidewise in the microscopy dish. Proceed with step 3.1.7.\n\t\tNOTE: For efficient staining with probes having poor diffusion in multicellular aggregates, prolong the loading concentration and/or time. Prior to use, determine the optional probe loading parameters in preliminary experiments.",
    "Remove the medium from the microscopy dish and rinse once with imaging media. Add the exact amount of imaging media to the sample (e.g., 300 µL per microwell of µ-chamber of a 12-well culture plate). Proceed with step 3.2.\nImage acquisition\n\t\nTurn on the microscope and connected devices (i.e., excitation light source, camera, computer, incubator, and other operating electronic blocks) 30 min before imaging to warm up and become equilibrated to the measurement conditions (temperature, different values of O2, 5% CO2, humidity if required). Start the microscopy operating software provided with the exact microscope set-up.\n\t\tNOTE: The described protocol is adapted for CellSens Dimension software v.3.\nSelect the appropriate excitation (source, power) and emission filters and the exposure time for chosen fluorescent (or phosphorescent) probes. For multi-parameter, 3D, and time-lapse microscopy analyses, write the automated measurement sequence protocol(s) in the operating microscope software.\nEmpirically determine the optimal imaging settings for each probe, experimental model, and cell line in preliminary experiments. Ensure that the settings have minimal photobleaching in reference (Iref) and O2 sensing (Isens) channels and minimal effect on the intensity ratio (R = Iref / Isens), especially in 3D and time-lapse measurement experiments.\nSet up the microscopy dish with stained spheroids on the microscopy stage. Using the low magnification objective, preview the sample in transmission light, do preliminary focusing on spheroids and locate them in the center of the image.\n\t\tNOTE: Standard 4x to 10x magnification air objectives will suffice for pre-focusing, while for the actual measurement we recommend 20x to 40x with numerical aperture (NA) of 0.6 or higher (air or water immersion) objectives having sufficient working distance for spheroids attached to the dish.",
    "Bring the objective with the required high magnification to the working position. Focus on transmission light mode in the middle (equatorial) cross-section of the spheroid. Oxygenation in 3D objects directly depends on the depth of the imaging section. To ensure this, analyze similar cross-sections in and between groups, e.g., middle, and top/bottom cross-sections of spheroids.\n\t\tNOTE: For detailed and precise analysis and reconstruction of O2 gradients, we recommend scanning and producing Z-stacks using confocal, light sheet, or two-photon (best option) microscopes. For conventional widefield microscopy, where the signal from all cross-sections will be collected simultaneously, an average estimation by the middle cross-section rather than an exact analysis of O2 gradients can be done. In this case, the middle cross-section is defined as a focal section, where the spheroids have maximal diameter with a sharp focus on their borders.\nAdjust settings for the collection of fluorescence/phosphorescence signals of reference and sensitive spectral channels of the O2 probe and other fluorescence probes applied for multiparametric imaging.\nFor the quantitative intensity-based comparison, apply the same chosen imaging settings of the exposure time, excitation light source power, resolution, scan speed, and pinhole size for all measured objects in groups.\n\t\tNOTE: Many vendor-provided microscopy software versions enable for automatic calculations of the intensity ratio. Apply function merge to intensity measurements of reference and sensitive channels of O2 probe, when writing the imaging acquisition program in the experimental manager in the imaging software used here.\nCollect images from the same optical section for reference and sensitive spectral channels of the O2 probe and, if needed, additional fluorescence channels. For this protocol, use MMIR1 probe with the red reference (exc. = 580 nm, em. = 650 nm) and near infrared O2-sensitive (exc. =635 nm, em. = 760 nm) spectra.",
    "Repeat steps 3.2.5-3.2.8 to collect a sufficient number of data points for statistical analysis. For the dynamic analysis of the rapidly evolving cellular responses upon treatment with different drugs, mitochondrial uncouplers or inhibitors of electron-transport chain and other fast-acting compounds, use the time-lapse measurement mode (step 3.2.10).\nPerform the measurements in imaging media, at 37 °C with periodic illumination of the sample and collect signals of the fluorophores of interest (e.g., O2 probe reference and sensing channels), e.g., every 10 s for over 2 min.\nPerform a focus check for every spheroid once the periodic measurement is done to ensure that there was no focus drift during the imaging. Repeat if required. Proceed with step 3.3 for data analysis.\n\t\tNOTE: Without cell stimulation and drug addition, time-lapse measurement can be performed to assess the photostability, in comparison to the reference dye, e.g., fluorescein, calcein green AM or tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester.\nImage presentation\n\tNOTE: Here we describe how to automatically calculate O2 probe intensity ratio (R) in spheroids using ratio analysis function in the imaging software and apply pixel by pixel R calculation to generate false-color R distribution images of spheroid microscopy section. R can also be calculated manually from the intensity data of reference and sensitive spectral channels collected from the same region of interest (ROI) of the spheroid image by application of the simple formula R = Iref/Isens24,34. If it is not possible to extract the intensity data from the raw image in the corresponding microscopy software, the intensity data can be obtained by using such programs as ImageJ or Fiji (see Discussion).",
    "Open the .vsi file with O2-probe intensity data from reference and sensitive spectral channels made in merged mode. Open the ratio analysis function window from the measure menu. Choose the intensity of the reference channel as the numerator and the intensity of the sensitive channel as the denominator for R calculation.\n\t\tNOTE: The reversed ratio of reference and sensitive signals for calculating R is also possible, but in this case, R will decrease with the increase in O2.\nApply corresponding intensity threshold settings to each spectral channel to subtract the background from the merged intensity image. Keep increasing the threshold values until the image background is uniformly black. Apply the threshold parameter equally to all spheroid images in the data set used in comparative analysis.\n\t\tNOTE: Use the preview window to optimize threshold settings by observing the preliminary calculated false color R image of spheroids. All pixels with intensity lower than the current value in the threshold field will be removed from the R analysis and presented as black spots. After the threshold application, only the area corresponding to spheroid fluorescence should be visualized. The preliminary estimation of the average background intensity (areas without spheroids) of the independent spectral channels simplifies the choice of an appropriate threshold to the image. Additionally, application of spheroid ROI borders, identified from the corresponding transmission light spheroid image to the merged fluorescence image helps accurate determination of the threshold parameters to prevent excessive subtraction of the non-background signal intensities.\nKeep the background settings for the numerator and denominator intensities at 0, as the background was already subtracted with threshold application.",
    "Adjust the scaling factor (Scale) to the ratio image until the preview image provides the desired resolution of the R gradient. Apply the scaling parameter equally to all spheroid images in the data set used in comparative analysis.\n\t\tNOTE: The scaling parameter should be big enough (at least 1,000) to ensure that the R image contains as much information as possible and can be viewed as a resolution factor for R numerical data.\nApply adjusted parameters to the spheroid image, by pressing Apply. Adjust the brightness and contrast of the image in the adjust display window from the tool windows menu.\nManually determine the linking and unlinking limits of a ratio distribution histogram by using the fixed scaling option in the Adjust Display window. This will determine the range of the false-color bar for the R parameter presentation.\n\t\tNOTE: To compare spheroid images between different groups, it is important to keep a similar color bar range for all analytical samples. As a range of changes of R parameter can be different between groups, the chosen false color bar range should be universal for distribution histograms in all analytical groups.\nSpheroids are not often ideally spherical, assume that the spheroid diameter is the longest line drawn through the center (often a hypoxic core) of the spheroid. Using the linear ruler function from the measure menu, determine the spheroid diameter. Export data as a spreadsheet table file.\nChoose the ROI of a required size (as small as possible) and shape (e.g., round) and apply it to the periphery and the hypoxic core of the spheroid. Transform the ROI to the measurement object to analyze the average R (peripheral R-Rp and core R-Rc) inside the chosen ROI. Export data in a spreadsheet-compatible table format.",
    "NOTE: Spheroids do not have identical O2 distribution among the group and the hypoxic cores do not perfectly co-localize with the spheroid centers. To simplify and standardize the analysis we assume that the most hypoxic areas correspond to the ideal core in the center of the spheroid. Rc measured in these zones is applied for calculations of O2 gradient range (Rp-Rc) and steepness (Rp-Rc) /r, where r (ideally, a distance between periphery and hypoxic core ROIs) is an approximate radius of the spheroid in µm calculated from the diameter measurements. Optionally, spheroid O2 gradients can be presented as linear line profiles of R parameter alteration (line profile window in measure menu) made along the spheroid diameter. This data can be also exported as a spreadsheet table file.\nApply measurements to each microscopy section of spheroids to obtain the data set of spheroid diameters, Rc and Rp to perform further calculations and statistical comparison. Combine all data in one spreadsheet file.\nFor time-lapse analysis of photobleaching or dynamic responses to different stimuli, apply the chosen ROI to the same coordinates on each image in a set. To compare R parameters, present them as a percentage from the R of the first cycle in a time-lapse image set.\nFor photobleaching analysis use R from several ROIs to calculate the average R in percentages for each time-lapse cycle and track the changes.\nAssume that the photobleaching effect is not critical if there was less than a 5% decrease in the initial intensity after 12 cycles of continuous illumination. Always compare dynamic changes with a photobleaching curve as a control to ensure the significance of ratiometric time-lapse response (see Figure 2A,B).",
    "From the obtained parameters calculate r, (Rp-Rc) and (Rp-Rc) / r for individual spheroids in a data set. Analyze the normality of the data distribution by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov or relevant tests. Choose the appropriate statistical method for data analysis and proceed with data presentation figures.\n\t\tNOTE: The data presented here was normally distributed and an independent t-test at p = 0.05 was implemented for statistical comparison between spheroid groups."
