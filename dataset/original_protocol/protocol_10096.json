    "All work involving live animals and animal tissue samples have been approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n1. Production of Harvesting Needles\nSetup of the production stage\n\t\nSecure a female luer lock connector onto a post, and mount the post onto a rotation stage so that the luer lock is at the center of the stage (Figure 1A).\nPosition this first rotation stage vertically, and mount it perpendicularly onto a second, horizontal rotation stage (Figure 1B).\nMount the horizontal rotation stage onto a two-axis translation stage (Figure 1B).\nFasten the combination onto a stable surface, such as an optical breadboard.\nSeparately mount a rotary tool onto the same breadboard, with the tool positioned in parallel with the breadboard and at approximately the same height as the luer lock connector on the rotation/translation combination stage (Figure 1C).\nInstall two cut-off wheels concentrically onto the rotary tool (a smaller, lower grit diamond cut-off wheel over a larger, higher grit stone cut-off wheel) (Figure 1D).\n\t\tNOTE: About a 9 mm difference between the diameters of the two wheels is generally sufficient.\nPosition an overhead light source with an adjustable arm over the rotary tool, with the light aimed at the cutting wheels.\nTo enhance visualization, position a dissecting microscope over the production setup so that the eyepiece is focused on the cutting discs (Figure 1C).\n\t\t​NOTE: Alternatively, users can wear magnifying eyewear.\nReshaping the needle tip\n\t\nWear protective eyewear and a surgical mask to prevent fine metal particles from entering the eyes or airways.\nChoose hypodermic needles of the appropriate gauge size, based on experimental requirements.\nMark off the intended length on each harvesting needle.",
    "NOTE: For harvesting from swine skin, 8 mm needles are typically sufficient; although, the length may vary based on experimental needs (e.g., thickness of target skin tissue, needle gauge size). Generally, a 19-gauge needle works well for swine skin.\nLower the needle perpendicularly to the rotary tool with the power on, using the edge of the outer cutting disc to cut off the excess length of the needle, at the point marked in step 1.2.3.\nConnect the shortened, blunt needle to the female luer lock connector on the production stage.\nAdjust the horizontal rotation stage so that the needle is at a 12° angle parallel to the cutting discs on the rotary tool (changing the angle will impact the force required for needle insertion).\nTurn on the overhead light and adjust its position while observing the needle under magnification, until the light is reflected off the midline (lengthwise) of the needle.\nPower on the rotary tool, then use the translation stage to advance the needle towards the inner (diamond) cutting disc (Figure 2A).\nKeep advancing the needle slowly against the cutting disc until the cutting disc reaches approximately the midline of the needle (as visualized by the overhead light's reflection along the midline).\nSlowly move the cut needle surface from the inner diamond wheel onto the outer stone wheel to finish the cut needle surface with a finer polish (Figure 2B).\nRetract the needle away from the cutting disc.\nUsing the vertical rotation stage, rotate the needle 180°.\nRepeat steps 1.2.9-1.2.10 to reshape the other side of the needle.\n\t\tNOTE: The needle should now have two cutting tips of approximately equal length (Figure 2C and 2D).\nRemove the needle from the production stage.\nClean the inside bore with a metal wire that is slightly smaller than the needle's inner diameter.",
    "Using a sharp wooden stick (e.g., by snapping off the end of the small wooden stick on a cotton tip applicator), remove any burrs that may be still attached to the edges of the newly-formed needle.\n\t\tNOTE: Harvesting needles can be electropolished and sterilized by autoclave if necessary.\n2. Skin Tissue Harvesting\nUse the harvesting needles to collect skin microcolumns from ex vivo tissue or live animals.\nFor ex vivo skin tissue that is thin (especially from samples where the subcutaneous fat is missing or was trimmed away), hold the target tissue over the opening of a 50 mL centrifuge tube, or stack two pieces of tissue on top of each other, to avoid damaging the needle tips by hitting them against hard surfaces.\n\t​NOTE: For in vivo harvesting from live animals, it is recommended that local lidocaine and epinephrine be administered by intradermal injection for analgesia and to reduce bleeding.\nAssemble the harvesting apparatus according to the amount of microcolumns needed, as described below.\nLow-medium volume option:\n\t\nTo harvest small to medium amounts of microcolumns, simply fill a standard syringe (10-20 mL syringes usually work well) with normal saline and connect it to a harvesting needle.\nCompletely insert the harvesting needle into the donor skin, then retract it.\nPush on the piston of the syringe to flush saline through the harvesting needle and expel the microcolumn that is lodged in the needle bore.\nTo speed up the harvesting process, repeat step 2.4.2 3 to 5 times before expelling the microcolumns in step 2.4.3.\n\t\tNOTE: It is usually convenient to expel the microcolumns into a standard cell strainer to ease the subsequent collection of microcolumns.",
    "If needles become clogged, increase the pressure on the piston to expel the stuck tissue and remove the clog. If simply increasing pressure is insufficient, insert a metal wire through the needle tip opening to clear the clog in the needle bore.\nKeep the microcolumns submerged in saline or medium until use to prevent desiccation .\n\t\t​NOTE: With an experienced operator, the method described above can be used to harvest microcolumns at a rate of approximately 1 microcolumn per second.\nHigh volume option:\n\t\nCreate a simple suction-assisted device that can be constructed to facilitate collection of large amounts of microcolumns.\n\t\tNOTE: The device consists of a harvesting needle, 20 mL syringe with luer lock nozzle, suction adapter typically used for liposuction (Figure 3A), and sterile suction canister.\nRemove the plunger from the 20 mL syringe.\nAttach the syringe to a suction adapter.\nComplete the assembly by attaching a harvesting needle to the syringe (Figure 3B).\nUse a piece of sterile suction tubing to connect the suction adapter to a sterile suction canister. Make sure the harvesting apparatus is connected to a canister input that allows fluid to flow into the canister unimpeded (which may require connection to a canister port that is marked for outflow rather than inflow).\nConnect the apparatus to a negative pressure source.\n\t\tNOTE: The pressure required depends on needle diameter and length, as previously described8. For the apparatus described in this manuscript, the suction system found in typical operating rooms is generally sufficient.\nConnect a harvesting needle to the syringe.\nHarvest the microcolumns by inserting the harvesting needle into the skin.\n\t\tNOTE: The microcolumns will be drawn into the syringe by suction, then flushed into the suction canister.",
    "Intermittently dip the harvesting needle into a container of sterile saline during the harvesting procedure to flush the system.\n\t\tNOTE: This saline flush facilitates transport of the microcolumn and ensures they stay hydrated. Alternatively, an MFF luer adaptor can be connected to the luer lock of the syringe, and through a connection tubing, also to a hanging saline drip bag.\nKeep on hand a metal wire, or smaller gauge needle, that is slightly smaller than the harvesting needle's inner diameter. If the needle becomes clogged, it can be cleared by inserting the metal wire into the needle bore.\nWhen the desired amount of microcolumns have accumulated in the canister, disconnect the device from suction, then pour the contents of the suction canister out through a filter to collect the microcolumns.\nAfter harvesting, apply a topical antibiotic ointment over the donor sites.\n\tNOTE: Additional dressings are generally not required for donor sites.\nSubscription Required.
