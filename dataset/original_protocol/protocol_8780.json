    "All experimental protocols were in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the institutional Animal Studies Committee at Washington University.\n1. Setting Up Perfusion and Specimen Holder\nPrepare solution for retina perfusion fresh on the day of the experiment. Use distilled and deionized water. Use one of the following three solutions.\n\t\nPrepare Bicarbonate-containing Ames’ solution (1 L): 1 bottle of Ames’ media and 1.9 g of NaHCO3,\nPrepare Locke’s solution (in mM): 112.5 NaCl, 3.6 KCl, 2.4 MgCl2, 1.2 CaCl2, 10.0 HEPES, 20.0 NaHCO3, 3.0 Na succinate, 0.5 Na glutamate, 0.02 EDTA, and 10.0 glucose, 0.1% MEM vitamins and amino acids\nPrepare HEPES-buffered Ringer solution (in mM): 133.3 NaCl, 3.3 KCl, 2.0 MgCl2, 1.0 CaCl2, 10.0 glucose, 0.01 EDTA, 12.0 HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.5 with ~5.8 ml of 1 M NaOH, add 0.72 g/L Leibovitz culture medium L-15. Use 20 - 50 μM DL-AP4 and 50 – 100 μM BaCl2 to isolate the photoreceptor response with any perfusion media.\nPrepare solution for electrodes28 (in mM): 140.0 NaCl, 3.6 KCl, 2.4 MgCl2, 1.2 CaCl2, 3 HEPES, 0.01 EDTA and adjust pH to 7.4 – 7.5 with NaOH. Electrode solution can be stored at RT for several months.\nPrepare and test the specimen holder.\n\t\nGlue black/grey filter paper on top of the domes of the specimen holder’s bottom part (see Figure 1A). Spread two-component 5 min epoxy glue carefully around the edges of the flat tops of the domes. If necessary, do it under dissection microscope.",
    "Wait until the glue is almost dry (about 4 min) and press the filter paper on the domes by using a flat item. Glue filter paper at least one day before the experiment. The filter paper can be used multiple times but should be replaced after a month of recordings. Use 70% ethanol to clean domes carefully from any glue residue before installing the replacement paper.\nFill the electrode channels with electrode solution trying to avoid any air bubbles and screw pellet electrodes enclosed with a threaded adapter into the electrode channels (see Figures 1A and B). Connect the top and bottom pieces of the specimen holder with four screws and fill the perfusion lines with electrode solution.\nMeasure the resistance and voltage between the leads of each electrode pair using a multimeter (Figure 1B). Resistance should be below 100 Ωk and the voltage below 10 mV if the channels are bubble-free and the electrodes are in good conditions.\nPour 400 - 700 ml of perfusion media in the glass bottle. Separate another 300 ml to be used in the dissection of the retinas and store it in a fridge. Set the perfusion tubing in the heat exchanger block and place the preheated block on the heating plate (see Figure 1D).\nEnclose the bottle with a cap that has connections to CO2/O2 gas (if Ames’ or Locke’s is used) and for perfusion tubing (see Figure 1D). Preheat the bottle with the media to 37 oC and place it on the heating plate or on the top of the light stimulation unit in water bath set to 37 – 39 oC17.\n\t\nPrime the perfusion lines by filling them with perfusion media to initiate the gravity-driven flow.",
    "In LKC system, place the bottle on the top of the stimulator unit17 to provide a significant gravitational flow that is then adjusted by flow-rate regulators without being affected by the lowering level of the perfusion solution in the bottle during the experiment.\nIn Ocuscience system, place the perfusion bottle inside the Faraday cage in order to minimize noise and place long perfusion output lines from the specimen holder (see step 2.8) well below the level of the specimen holder (and perfusion bottle) to increase gravitational drive of the solution. Shield these output lines and connect the shield to the amplifier’s ground to prevent coupling of the electromagnetic noise to the ERG signal.\nAdjust the perfusion to 3 – 5 ml/min by using flow-rate regulators. Connect 5% CO2 / 95% O2 gas from a cylinder with proper regulator and adjust the flow rate to ensure steady bubbling of the media in the bottle through an air stone.\n2. Sample Preparation\nAssemble clean and sharp dissection instruments including straight-bladed microscissors, one or two 45o tweezers, razor blade and a rectangular piece of filter paper.\nPour about 200 ml of cold perfusion solution in a large Petri dish so that the whole bottom part of the specimen holder (including the domes) can be immersed into the solution. This step becomes important when mounting the retinas on the domes (see step 2.6). Although some solutions are designed to be saturated with carbogen (5% CO2 / 95% O2), this is not essential for the dissection purposes and was not done in the experiments described here.",
    "For a typical experiment, keep animals in 12/12 hrs dark/light cycle and dark-adapt them for 6 – 12 hrs before the recordings. Euthanize the animal by CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation under dim red light and do all the following procedures under dim red or IR light (use e.g., red filter in front of the microscope light source).\n\t\nPull the eyes out by using tweezers and put them in the media. Place one eye at a time on a small piece of paper (e.g., some regular filter paper) and make a slit approximately on the level of ora serrata while holding the eye with tweezers (this is done outside of the solution here).\nCut along the ora serrata (or closer to the equator of the eye) with microscissors and remove the cornea and the lens. Place the eye cup in the cold media in the large Petri dish and repeat the same procedure with the other eye.\nCut a small incision from the top of the eye cup towards the optic nerve by keeping the scissors between the retina and sclera in order to keep the retina as intact as possible. Grip the sclera from both sides of the incision by using two tweezers and pull the tweezers away from each other to detach the retina.\n\t\nCut the optic nerve and try to isolate the retina with a minimum amount of physical contact to the distal surface. RPE will mostly detach automatically from the retina during the dissection process. It is more important to avoid mechanical disturbance of the retina than to perform the dissection quickly, generally retinas can be incubated at least 30 min in the solution without significant effects on the response properties.",
    "Mount the retinas on the domes of the specimen holder (Figure 1C). Immerse the bottom part of the specimen holder in the Petri dish with the dissected retinas. Slide the retina, photoreceptor side (the convex surface of the isolated retina) upwards, above the dome and lift the specimen holder so that the retina attaches on the filter paper. Repeat the procedure for the other retina.\nDry the holder plate carefully to prevent electrical crosstalk between the retinas as well as noise and signal shunting. Specimen holder has O-rings around the bottom part domes to prevent solution spill between the bottom and top parts of the holder as well as to help electrical isolation of the photoreceptor and ganglion cell sides of the individual retinas. Attach the top part of the holder with the four screws (see Figure 1B) and fill the perfusion channels with perfusion solution by using a syringe and a needle.\nTransfer the specimen holder next to the heat exchanger block and connect the input and output perfusion lines to the specimen holder (Figure 1D). Connect the electrodes to the ERG amplifier (top electrodes connect to the ground/minus pin in the amplifier) and attach the stimulator/control unit on the specimen holder by using an adaptor or slide the heating pad into the stimulator unit depending on which in vivo ERG system is used.\n3. Recordings\nConfigure the amplifier and stimulus settings by using the in vivo system’s software. Set the acquisition frequency to a value between 1 and 10 kHz and low-pass filtering to 300 Hz. Do not use high-pass filtering. Use 60 Hz (or 50 Hz in Europe) notch filter if necessary.",
    "Record baseline without light stimulation and with dim stimulation (e.g., green light of -35 dB or 0.3 mCd sm-2) to test for good electrical connection between the electrodes and retina sample. Wait 10 – 20 min before starting the data collection so that retinal temperature and function reach a stable state.\n\t\nChoose stimulus parameters according to any specific experiment and start data collection. E.g., use green light from -40 up to 0 dB or from 0.1 up to 1,000 mCd sm-2 for a scotopic response family. Use about 2 to 3 log-units brighter flashes in photopic recordings where rods have to be suppressed by background light (3 – 30 Cdm-2) or a probe flash (about 1.3 Cd sm-2 = 1 dB, see Figure 3).\nHowever, remember that the exact light intensity values might be somewhat dependent on your system calibration and experimental conditions. As a rule of thumb, scale intensities down by 5 – 10-fold as compared to in vivo recordings when using green light17. A black cover with apertures above the retinas (included in the commercial adapter system) can be used to reduce light scattering in the specimen holder and facilitate homogenous and equal stimulation of both retinas by the Ganzfeld sphere of the commercial in vivo systems.\n\t\tNOTE: For recordings from dark-adapted retina, the intensities of test flashes used in a typical experiment bleach only a negligible fraction of the pigment so that the lack of RPE-driven regeneration is not an issue. In addition, it has been previously shown that cone pigment regeneration can still take place in the isolated retina via the Müller cell visual cycle20.\nAs experiments last typically from 30 min up to several hours, monitor baseline drift, noise level and response stability during the experiment as changes in these might indicate technical problems.",
    "​NOTE: Increased noise or decreased response amplitudes may indicate air bubbles in the perfusion or electrode channels, too low or high temperature, solution leak/spill or displacement of the retina.\n4. Cleaning\nDetach the specimen holder from the perfusion lines, open it and flush the retinas from the filter paper. Remove the electrodes and rinse them with distilled water (do not use ethanol). Clean the specimen holder (including the perfusion channels) with ethanol and/or distilled water. Flush perfusion tubing carefully with >70% ethanol.\nRinse the perfusion bottle with distilled water (do not use detergents). Ethanol can be also used to clean the bottle.\nSubscription Required.
