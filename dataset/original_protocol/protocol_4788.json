    "Streak a MA plate with the cryopreserved V. campbellii strain of interest. Incubate for single colonies at 30 °C for 24-36 h. If required, supplement the plates with suitable antibiotics (e.g., kanamycin, see flow chart in Figure 4 for more details).Note: We generally prepare two bacterial stocks: the first in commercial cryovials with beads for storage in our strain repository, and the second in 25-30% glycerol to be used as a working stock. Both are preserved at -80 °C. Even if we have not experienced any issue, we use this copy of the stock since repeated freezing and thawing can damage the cells, particularly if they are used routinely. For one streak we just use a 1-μl inoculating loop or any other sterile material. We start the assays from single colonies after 24-36 h incubation. This agar plate can be preserved at 4-5 °C for at least 1 week without loss of reproducibility. Alternatively, cultures can be prepared directly from the stocks; in that case, we recommend using 10 μl for inoculating 3 ml of AB medium (see next step).Prepare a culture of the V. campbellii strain of interest by inoculating 3 ml of AB medium in a 15-ml tube with a fresh colony. Incubate overnight in a tube rotator (40 rpm) at 30 °C to an OD600 of around 0.5 (1 mm path length).Distribute 100 µl of a 2x dilution of the test compounds in AB medium into the wells of a white, clear-bottom 96-well plate. Serial dilutions, if required, can be prepared in the plate.Note: We usually prepare 80 mM stocks of the test products in DMSO. Using a cut-off dose of 200 µM yields a maximum solvent concentration of 0.25% v/v that has not significant effect on bacterial growth and luminescence.",
    "No-treatment controls and solvent controls are included in each plate, as well as 100 μM cinnamaldehyde (positive control) and water (negative control) (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160713/20160713184110_1446.jpgFigure 1. Plate distribution showing sample wells (x80), No-Treatment Control wells (NTC, x3), Solvent Control wells (SC, x3), Positive Control wells (PC, x3), Negative Control wells (NC, x3) and Blank wells (x4). Serial two-fold dilutions of the test compounds, if required, are proposed from rows A to H.Dilute the overnight V. campbellii culture 1:50 in fresh AB medium. This gives an inoculum of approximately 1-2 x 107 CFU ml-1 that will be further diluted 1:2 (see next step).Note: When establishing this protocol in the laboratory, we recommend verifying the cell density of the inoculum as described by Harrison et al., 2010. Briefly, 180 µl of AB medium are distributed into four columns of a sterile 96-well plate, from row A to H. Twenty µl of inoculum are pipetted into the A-row wells and serially diluted (-1 to -8 dilutions). Using a multichannel pipette, 10 µl of the dilutions are spotted onto the surface of a MA plate. Up to four replicates of each dilution can be easily spotted onto a standard 90-100 mm agar plate. The spots are dried inside a biosafety cabinet and the plates incubated for 24 h at 30 °C for CFU count. For an accurate determination of the cell density, take into consideration the lowest concentration in which individual colonies can be counted. The CFU per ml will be = imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160713/20160713190803_6554.jpg x 10 (d+2), where n represents the colony count in each of the 4 replicates, and d the corresponding dilution. The actual cell density in the assay will be half of this calculation.  Distribute 100 µl of the diluted bacterial culture into the wells.",
    "Seal the plate with a sterile, breathable and transparent sealing film (Figure 2).Note: Use a brayer for carefully sealing the plate. Do not remove the external protective cover until the plate is properly sealed in order to avoid contamination.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160713/20160713184535_2358.jpgFigure 2. Aspect of a sealed, white, clear-bottom 96-well plate Incubate the plate for 18 h at 30 °C and internal orbital shaking (150 rpm). Take OD600 and luminescence readings every 15 min.Note: Plate dimension, measurement height and Z’ optimizations are advised when using EnSpire® Multimode Plate Reader. Similarly, flatfield and crosstalk corrections optimize the readings. We do not recommend using a distance between plate and detector lower than 0.6 mm (otherwise, contaminations might occur due to damage of the sealing film). Activate the condensation prevention option for sealed plates (upper heater temperature 2 °C warmer than lower heater temperature)."
