    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIsolation of cancer cells from primary tumor tissue\nTiming: 2 h\nHere we are describing the method employed to isolate and enrich primary CSCs from freshly resected human colorectal tumor tissues (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Patient-derived samples are obtained with informed consent and are mechanically dissociated into smaller fragments, followed by enzymatic dissociation. The resulting cell suspension is strained to eliminate debris and aggregates. Upon lysis of red blood cells and exclusion of dead cells, a sorting procedure is applied to isolate the CD133+ fraction. Cell sorting increases chances of successfully initiate spheroid formation over a subsequent culture period in non-adherent conditions. This section is an adaptation of a method described by Kreso et O’Brien. (Kreso and O'Brien, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1473-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic description of the method used to establish CSC-enriched cultures from human primary colorectal tumor tissues\nNote: Fresh primary colorectal tumor tissues obtained from surgical procedures in the clinic must be preserved on ice, in a 15 mL conical tube (or equivalent) containing a physiological saline solution such as PBS and must not be frozen. Case-specific information may be provided be the clinical team, such as the age and the biological sex of the patient, as well as the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, the localization, the mutational status, and other pathological parameters of the neoplasm depending on Research Ethics Board approvals.\nObtain a freshly resected primary CRC sample in a 50 mL collection tube on ice, and immediately proceed to tissue dissociation in a biological safety cabinet.\nTransfer the CRC tumor fragment to a 35 mm petri dish containing 5 mL of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution. Use the PBS to wash blood and/or debris.",
    "Aspirate the PBS and perform a second wash of the tumor fragment using 3 mL of cold CSC media. Aspirate and replace the media with 3 mL of fresh CSC media.\nOptional: If biobanking is advised, dissect the tissue into multiple fractions, for either protein/RNA/DNA extracts or histology embedding. Make sure to preserve a tissue section of ≥1cm3 for CSC isolation.\nUtilizing forceps to immobilize the tumor fragment, use a razor blade to mince the tumor fragment into ∼2 mm pieces in CSC media.\nCritical: Mincing the tissue into smaller pieces maximizes the number of cells obtained through the isolation process.\nUse scissors to cut the aspirating end of a p1000 tip to make it wider and use it to transfer the minced tumor fragment suspension to a 50 mL conical tube containing 5 mL of the Tumor Dissociation Solution.\nTransfer tube containing the suspension to a 37°C incubator or water bath for 1 h.\nEvery 15 min, vigorously flick the tube 10–15 times to aid the enzymatic dissociation of the tumor sample. Alternatively, 10–15 up and down pipetting with a sterile 5 mL serological pipette can be performed.\nPass the digested tumor suspension through a sterile 70 μm cell strainer and collect the filtrate into a new sterile 50 mL conical tube. Wash the strainer with 1–2 mL of CSC media.\nCentrifuge the filtrate at 450×g for 5 min at 4°C. Extend the centrifugation time if no substantial cell pellet can be observed. Aspirate and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 5 mL of a solution of 0.8% (w/v) Ammonium Chloride 0.8% + 0.1 mM EDTA to lyse red blood cells. Incubate on ice for 10 min to allow red blood cells lysis.",
    "Critical: If red blood cell lysis is incomplete and marked by residual red coloration, increase the volume of Ammonium Chloride solution, and let the cells to deposit for an extra 10 min.\nAdd an equal volume of CSC media to the cell suspension and centrifuge at 450×g for 5 min at 4°C. Aspirate and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 10 mL of fresh CSC media and remove dead cells from the tumor cell suspension using either Ficoll or a Dead Cell Removal kit following the manufacturer’s guidelines[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/upload/assets/IM0001218.PDF].\nResuspend the resulting live cell fraction into desired volume of CSC media and perform cell viability counts using trypan blue and a hemocytometer, or an automated cell counter (e.g., Countess™ 3 Automated Cell Counter or equivalent). See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]\nNote: If cell sorting methods are not available, it is possible to proceed to step-15 and initiate spheroid growth without enriching for CD133+ cells. However, based on our experience, the success rate of spheroid formation is much lower without cell sorting.\nProceed to Magnetic-Activated Cell Sorting (MACS) of the primary CRC cell suspension to obtain a fraction enriched in CD133+ tumor-initiating cells (O'Brien et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]). Use the MiniMACS Starting Kit (or equivalent) with the CD133 MicroBead Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/upload/assets/IM0007587.PDF].\nNote: Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) can be used instead of MACS to enrich CD133+ colorectal tumor cells prior to establish spheroid cultures. However, we recommend the use of MACS for manipulators relying on core facility based FACS infrastructures with schedule restrictions. Since the access to primary tumor tissues can sometimes be difficult to plan, MACS represents a more flexible option for spontaneous tissue processing.",
    "Optional: An initial MACS sorting step using EpCAM/CD326-conjugated MicroBeads, prior to CD133+ cell enrichment can help excluding stromal, endothelial and hematopoietic cells from the CRC tumor cell mixture (Kreso and O'Brien, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]).\nResuspend the CD133+ tumor cell fraction in 10 mL of CSC media and perform a cell count using Trypan blue and a hemocytometer, or an automated cell counter. See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]\nTransfer 5 × 104 cells/mL into non-adherent flasks and culture the cells at 37°C, 5% CO2 for ∼2 weeks or until visible multicellular aggregates emerge from the cultures (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1473-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Macroscopic assessment of CSC-enriched spheroid growth and integrity\n(A) Image of colorectal CSC-enriched spheroids growing in suspension.\n(B–E) The high magnification inset is indicating how users should see spheroids by eye. Representative images of typical (B) spherical and (C) ruffled shaped spheroids suitable to use for organoid plating. Representative images of (D) disrupted and (E) overgrown spheroids, which should not be used for organoid plating. Scale bar = 100 μm.\nNote: Since independent patient samples differ in terms of CSC frequency, the success rate for spheroid formation cannot be 100%. Moreover, some CRC primary samples will yield faster and more robust spheroid growth. Lastly, the spheroids shape often differ from a patient to another, forming either spherical or ruffled/irregular structures (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C).\nMaintenance of colorectal CSC spheroids\nTiming: 1 week",
    "This step describes the timing and culture needs to maintain robust CSC-enriched spheroids in suspension. Our previous work demonstrated that 90%–95% of the cells constituting such spheroids are simultaneously expressing the surface markers CD44 and CD133, which are related to colorectal CSCs (Bergin et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Du et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; O'Brien et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]). Spheroids can be passaged using either a mechanical or chemical/enzymatic dissociation method. It is noteworthy that CSC-enriched spheroid cultures can be established from patient-derived tumor tissues, as detailed in the previous section, or from commercial sources of colorectal CSCs (e.g., Celprogen Inc., Torrance, CA). Specific CRC cell lines such as HCT116 can also efficiently form spheroid suspensions when cultured in CSC media (serum-free) in non-adherent flasks. These provide additional options for users to execute this serial organoid plating protocol.\nOnce established, spheroid cultures must be monitored daily, and CSC media changed at least once every 3 days.\nTo proceed to media change, place the flasks containing the spheroid cultures in a sterile biological safety cabinet and transfer the entire volume to a 15 mL conical tube.\nAllow spheres to deposit at the bottom of the tube or proceed to a brief, gentle centrifugation (450×g, 30 s).\nAspirate the culture media without disturbing the pellet and carefully resuspend spheroids in 8–10 mL of fresh CSC media.\nCritical: When changing the media of spheroid cultures, proceed gently and avoid harsh or repetitive pipetting to preserve the integrity of the structures.\nCSC-enriched spheroid passaging must be performed once a week, or earlier if the user notices a fast growth rate. We recommend mechanical disruption of spheroids as a rapid and efficient method for passaging.\nCritical: Under-passaging CSC-enriched spheroids increases cell death and impact the integrity of CSCs for subsequent organoid formation.",
    "Note: Fast spheroid growth can be monitored by the acidification rate of the CSC media (shift in DMEM/F12 pH indicator) and by microscopic observations revealing deteriorated and overgrown spheroids (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D and 2E).\nWhen a spheroid culture is ready to be split, transfer the spheroids suspension to a 15 mL conical tube using a sterile 10 mL serological pipette.\nNote: Larger cultures with high spheroid density should be separated into two tubes to ensure ease with disruption.\nMechanically disrupt the spheroids by executing vigorously up and down pipetting for 5 min using a sterile 5 mL serological pipette.\nAssess by eye the presence of residual spheroids and continue up and down pipetting for an additional 5 min if needed.\nOnce no spheroids are visible, filter the cell suspension through a 70 μm cell strainer to eliminate cell aggregates. Resuspend the cell suspension in the desired volume of CSC media. Perform cell counts and transfer 5 × 104 cells/mL into 8 mL of CSC media in a new series of non-adherent culture flasks.\nCritical: Since patient-derived spheroid are valuable samples, we recommend freezing stocks at early passages. Whole CSC-enriched spheroids are cryopreserved in a freezing media, which consists in a 10% DMSO, 30% KnockOut Serum Replacement, and 60% CSC media mixture. On thawing, it is critical to immediately wash off the freezing media and resuspend the spheroids in fresh CSC media. Gentle pipetting must be observed to minimize the disruption of spheroid structures. Moreover, it is critical to track the number of passaging to avoid bringing the cultures beyond 10–12 passages. Such a practice mitigates artifactual tissue culture adaptation of CSCs and preserves molecular characteristics of the tumor of origin (Ray et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]).",
    "Optional: Enzymatic dissociation of CSC-enriched spheroids can also represent a suitable method for passaging. However, it can affect surface protein markers and may alter specific experimental readouts upon dissociation, such as flow cytometry. For enzymatic dissociation of CSC-enriched spheroid cultures, refer to Kreso et al. (Kreso and O'Brien, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]).\nPause point: The protocol can be paused at this point if the user opt for freezing the spheroid cultures.\nPrimary organoid formation in BME domes\nTiming: 2 h\nThe following steps describe the procedure to embed colorectal CSCs into 3D BME structures and grow tumor organoids, as illustrated in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A. Single cells with tumor-initiating functions have the capacity to form organoid structures once embedded in BME (Bergin et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Masibag et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]). Such patient-derived tumor organoids can be subjected to therapeutic interventions to further evaluate their impact on different functions ex vivo (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1473-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Organoid plating procedure from colorectal CSC-enriched spheroid cultures\n(A) Schematic description of the method used to embed primary colorectal CSCs in 3D BME domes and generate a miniaturized tumor ex vivo system to test therapeutic interventions.\n(B) Image sequence (left to right) demonstrating how to properly plate the 1:1 BME/cell mixture to form domes in a 6-well plate. The bottom panels represent a high-magnification view of the well.\n(C) Schematics illustrating the appropriate positioning of the p1000 pipettor when plating BME/cell mixture to form 3D domes. Wells in which the BME/cell mixture disperses across the plastic surface should not be considered for subsequent steps.\nTransfer CSC-enriched spheroids from culture flasks to 15 mL conical tubes and mechanically dissociate the spheres as above-described to generate single-cell suspensions.\nTypically, 1 mL of spheroid suspension is sufficient to seed a full 6-well plate with primary organoids.",
    "Make sure to pass the dissociated spheroid suspension through a 70 μm cell strainer to eliminate multicellular aggregates.\nCritical: If the experiment requires viral vector-based transduction (e.g., lentiviral particles), it is essential to perform the transduction on the single cell suspension, prior to BME embedding. BME-embedded epithelial structures were documented as refractory to viral-based gene delivery (Maru et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]). Moreover, genome engineering interventions, such as CRISPR-Cas9 based knockout or knockin systems must also be performed at that stage (Hendriks et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]; Michels et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]).\nNote: At this point, take an aliquot of BME from −80°C and let it thaw on ice.\nPerform a live cell count using trypan blue and a hemocytometer, or an automated cell counter. See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]\nIn a sterile 15 mL conical tube, prepare a 2 cells/μL dilution in CSC media.\nFor a 6-well plate, we recommend plating 300 cells per dome. Thus, 1,800 cells should be diluted in a final volume of 900 μL of CSC media.\nOnce the BME aliquot has completely thawed, quickly add BME to the cell suspension according to a 1:1 ratio (BME:cell suspension) to obtain a final 1 cell/μL dilution.\nFor an entire 6 well-plate, transfer 900 μL of BME to 900 μL of cell suspension.\nCritical: The BME solution will immediately start polymerizing at temperatures above 9°C. Immediately proceed to the next step once BME is added to the cell suspension to avoid uneven or premature polymerization before dome plating. We recommend plating no more than 6 wells at the time to avoid BME polymerization issues.\nUsing a p1000 pipettor, gently homogenize the BME/cell mixture and carefully deposit 300 μL at the center of each well of a 6-well culture plate to form dome structures, as illustrated in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B.",
    "It is important to proceed quickly to ensure BME does not polymerize before dome formation\nPlace the tip of the p1000 at the center of the well, carefully dispense a small volume of the solution that will serve as a starting point for dome formation (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B, Methods videos S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] and S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Appropriate plate procedure to form BME domes in a 6-well culture plate, related to step 25\nBME volume is dispensed in the center of the well using a p1000 pipettor. BME should not disperse across the well. Avoid any disturbances such as shocks or excessive vibrations during and after plating.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2: Close-up view of the BME dome plating procedure in a 6-well culture plate, related to step 25\nCarefully dispense the remainder of the 300 μL at the same position and ensure it forms a tridimensional dome and does not spread out along the plate (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nRepeat these steps for each well into which organoids must be seeded.\nWithout disrupting the domes, place lid on the culture plate and gently transfer it to the incubator for a 10-min incubation at 37°C, 5% CO2. See troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]\nEnsure to transfer the plate very steadily without tipping or using swift movements.\nCritical: At this step, dome disruption results in a failed experiment since it will hinder proper 3D growth of the organoids.\nOnce the polymerization period is over, transfer the dome-containing plate back to the biological safety cabinet. Ensure BME domes have preserved their integrity and have not dispersed across the well (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).",
    "Note: After 10 min at 37°C, we recommend to visually inspect each well under a light microscope to ensure an even vertical distribution of the cells across the dome structures. If all cells are found at the bottom of the dome(s), it may indicate BME polymerization issues, and such domes should not be used. Contacts between the cells and the culture-treated plastic induce different cell behaviors vs. BME embedding and may alter the experimental outcomes.\nFill the dome-containing wells with 3 mL of CSC media.\nDrug treatments (vs. controls) can be initiated ≥24 h post-seeding by adding the appropriate concentration of each compound in a fresh batch of CSC media (plan 3 mL per well).\nCarefully aspirate the media from dome-containing wells without disrupting the structures and add 3 mL of drug or control/vehicle supplemented CSC media.\nTerminate the drug treatments by replacing the media with fresh, drug-free CSC media at the desired period.\nTumor organoid growth period can be extended beyond the drug treatments, as desired.\nNote: For drug treatments, it is expected that certain compounds will exert cytotoxic effects on primary organoid growth. We recommend testing each drug at escalating concentrations vs. control(s) to identify a dose range yielding sufficient residual primary organoids for subsequent evaluation of tumor-initiating activity in secondary passages.\nNote: Typically, it will take 1–2 weeks to notice visible organoids, depending on the patient sample(s) used. Each patient sample gives rise to organoids presenting unique growth rate, morphological aspects, and metabolic activity. We recommend performing pilot experiments to establish patient-specific timelines and determine whether CSC media needs to be replenished over the primary organoid growth period. See troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]",
    "Use a high content imaging system (e.g., ImageXpress Pico Automated Cell Imaging System, or equivalent) to quantify changes in organoid counts and other morphological characteristics, such as size and form factor (Huang et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]) in response to drug treatments. Perform brightfield scans of each well with Z-stack acquisition, ideally using 4× or 10× objective to generate merged composite images of all acquired optical sections (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). Using a high content imaging analysis software (e.g., CellReporterXpress, Molecular Devices) it is possible to identify and count CRC tumor organoids based on a size exclusion threshold approach, as illustrated in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B. The size exclusion cut-off must be pre-determined by the user. See troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1473-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Examples of organoid detection methods using high content imaging\n(A) 3D-embedded organoids can be detected, counted, and scored by high content imaging using ImageXpress Automated Cell Imaging Systems, or equivalent platforms.\n(B) Example of organoid detection based on a size exclusion threshold, where cellular structures below a definite size are not counted from brightfield images. A color mask is applied by the analysis software over each structure considered as an organoid. Scale bar = 70 μm.\n(C) Example for the use of a fluorescent (GFP) reporter system outlining a specific population of HCT116 organoids to be counted in an experiment. A color mask is applied by the analysis software over each structure presenting a fluorescence signal above a definite background threshold (FLUOR Mask). Scale bar = 70 μm.\n(D) Identification of live organoid structures using the cell permeable, fluorescent dye Calcein AM (green). While several live organoids are detectable in DMSO-treated wells, only residual live cells are observed upon treatments with the anticancer small molecule YB-0158. Scale bar = 70 μm.",
    "Optional: For experiments based on fluorescence reporter systems to detect specific tumor organoids, a fluorescence z-stack acquisition scan of each well must be performed in addition to brightfield, enabling reporter-positive organoid counts (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C) (Benoit et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nOptional: Fluorescence probes such as Calcein AM can be used to visualize live and metabolically active tumor organoids upon conversion of the non-fluorescent probe into acetoxymethyl ester hydrolyzed fluorescent Calcein (green) by intracellular esterases (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D). Only use permanent labeling reagents such as Calcein AM if these are known not to interfere with critical biological parameters of the experiment (Vilgelm et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib31]).\nPrimary organoid harvest and secondary organoid plating\nTiming: 2 h\nThe following steps describe the harvest of BME-embedded primary organoids and subsequent plating of secondary organoid series (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). To assess the impact of a drug treatment (or gene-specific silencing) on CSCs tumor-initiating capacity within CRC tumor organoids, it is essential to conduct serial/secondary plating from dissociated primary organoids. Such a rationale was initially proposed in hematopoietic stem/progenitor systems (Rizo et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]) and further adapted by us for CRC (Bergin et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Masibag et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]). Upon the initial growth of primary organoid incubation, resulting control and drug-treated organoids will be dissociated into single-cell suspensions and embedded in a secondary series of BME domes, as detailed in steps 21–28 (starting with organoids instead of spheroids). Importantly, this secondary series of tumor organoids will not be further exposed to any drug treatments or other therapeutic interventions (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). If the tumor-initiating cell populations are altered by the treatment(s) of primary organoids, lower secondary organoid formation frequency values should be observed compared to control groups upon high content imaging of the experimental plates (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1473-Fig5.jpg",
    "Figure 5. Schematic description of the method used to determine the impact of ex vivo therapeutic interventions on CSC activity based on secondary organoid formation frequency\nNote: Before starting this part, take an aliquot of BME out from −80°C and let it thaw on ice.\nGently aspirate the media surrounding the primary organoid-containing domes, and gently wash each well with 4 mL of sterile PBS. Repeat the aspiration step to discard the PBS.\nAdd 1 mL of Gentle Cell Dissociation reagent to chemically dissociate the BME domes and organoids.\nTransfer the plate(s) containing the organoids to harvest to the incubator, at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 10 min.\nAfter the first 5 min of incubation, pipette up and down using a sterile 5 mL serological pipette to help dissociate the BME, and put the plate back to the incubator for another 5 min.\nOnce the 10-min incubation is over, execute up and down pipetting until no organoids are visible, and filter the cell suspension through a 70 μm strainer to eliminate multicellular aggregates. Collect the filtrate in a new sterile 50 mL conical tube.\nComplete the filtrate volume to 10 mL with CSC media and preform cell counts using trypan blue and a hemocytometer, or an automated cell counter. See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]\nFor each secondary dome, plate a total of 15 × 104 cells in a volume of 300 μL of BME:cell suspension mixture (or 50 cells/μL).\nNote: Since secondary organoid plating is executed using cell harvests from primary organoids, which present an heterogeneous composition with significantly lower CSC populations than spheroids (Bergin et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]), larger number of cells must be plated to enhance the frequency of secondary tumor organoids.",
    "Proceed to BME re-embedding of primary organoid cells by executing steps 23 to 28 but using the appropriate cell number per well. See troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]\nOptional: Secondary organoid plating can be performed following a limiting dilution assay (LDA) format, by seeding decreasing number of cells (e.g., 3 × 104, 1.5 × 104, 7.5 × 103, 3.75 × 103, etc.) in series of independent domes. While this approach represents a considerable investment in material and reagents, LDA plating followed by Poisson Distribution analysis can help users estimating the number of CSCs present in each experimental condition for every patient sample involved in the assay (Dorrell et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10])."
