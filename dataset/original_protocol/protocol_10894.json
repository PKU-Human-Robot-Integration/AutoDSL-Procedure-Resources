    "The experiments were approved by the Bioethical Committee of the Institute of Cellular Physiology of UNAM (No. CECB_08) and carried out under the guidelines of The Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association.\n1. Experimental Set-up\nMaterial and stimuli set-up for performing an aperiodic interval discrimination (AID) task\nPerform this experiment on a computer with a minimum of 8 GB RAM, 2.5 GHz processor, and a 60 Hz refreshing rate monitor to create and run the task.\nObtain a set of noise-canceling headphones to avoid environmental sounds distracting the participants while performing the task.\nUse a decibel meter to set the volume of the headphones to ~65 dB SPL.\nCreate the V, A, and AV stimuli for the task by running a graphical user interface (GUI) included in this protocol (Figure 1), or by using programs such as PsychToolbox or PsychoPy.\n\t\t\nDownload the Stimuli_GUI.zip file from http://www.ifc.unam.mx/investigadores/Luis-lemus. Then, open MATLAB (2016a or higher for this GUI).\n\t\t\t\nClick on the SetPath option at the MATLAB’s menu tab to add the Stimuli_GUI folder to the workspace. First, select the Add Folder button, select the Stimuli_GUI folder, and press the Save button. Finally, close the window by clicking on the Close button.\nOpen the Stimuli_GUI.m file using the Open option under the Main menu tab. Then, press F5 on the keyboard to display the GUI (Figure 1).\nClick on the Condition popup menu to select the preferred distribution of pulses (i.e., Periodic for creating a stimulus of equidistant pulses, or Aperiodic for a random distribution). Then, select the desired number of pulses (i.e., 2 - 6) in the Number of Pulses popup menu. Finally, enter the desired duration of the stimulus in the Duration dialog box.",
    "CAUTION: To avoid V flicker fusion (i.e., two or more pulses are perceived as only one), it is essential to create interpulse intervals (IPI) of a minimum of 30 ms. Therefore, given that each of the pulses is predefined to last 50 ms, the maximum number of pulses in a stimulus is constrained by the IPIs. Pulses exceeding the minimum IPI produce an error.\n\t\t\tNote: The program generates images in an Audio Video Interleave (AVI) format at a rate of 60 frames per second. However, they can be created online at each trial using PsychToolbox or PsychoPy. Consider creating 50-ms pulses by concatenating at least three frames of 4° gray circles on black backgrounds. Here, the method generates AVI and WAV files for implementing in LabVIEW, thus suggesting the possibility of using more complex video or audio clips.\nClick on the Generate IPI button to display the IPIs’ values at the IPI values box and to see a plot of the resultant distribution of the pulses.\n\t\t\tNote: The IPI values update automatically at every click of the Generate IPI button. These values can be copied and saved for further analysis.\nGenerate and store a V stimulus by typing a descriptive filename (e.g., PeriodicVisual500ms.avi) in the Enter Video Filename dialog box. Click on the Generate Video button and wait for the popup window displaying gray ~4° circles to close. Then, click on the Play button to see the created V stimulus.\n\t\t\tCAUTION: While the program generates the images, do not click on other figures, as this may cause the program to lose the figure’s handle and produce a faulty video.\n\t\t\tNote: The angular amplitude of a V object is obtained by the following equation (2).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58408/58408eq2.jpg(2)",
    "​Here, a is the amplitude of V expressed in degrees, S is the visual’s size in centimeters, measured at the screen, and D is the distance in centimeters from the observer to the screen.\nGenerate and store an A stimulus using the same V IPI values by typing a descriptive filename (e.g., AperiodicAcoustic500ms.wav) in the Enter Audio Filename dialog box. Click on the Generate Audio button to observe a plot of the created audio and click on the Play button to listen to the new audio.\n\t\t\tNote: The predefined A pulse frequency is 1 kHz; however, it is possible to change it in the Sound Frequency (Hz) dialog box.\nRepeat steps 1.1.4.2 through 1.1.4.5 to create 10 aperiodic (AP) stimuli for each of the comparison intervals of the AID task (i.e., V and A intervals from 500 ms to 1,100 ms in steps of 100 ms). Create only one periodic (P) stimulus for each of the intervals of the control sets.\nGenerate an extended white-noise clip (e.g., 30 min) to use as background during the experiment, or download it from an internet library.\nCreate a 3° white cross and save it in a JPEG file to use as a cue for the participants to initiate a trial.\n\t\tNote: AV stimuli result from superimposing V and A congruent clips during the execution of the task. Shift the A stimuli up to 90 ms after the V onset for producing perceptual simultaneity32.\nTask design and implementation",
    "Create sets of P and AP V, A, and AV trials by listing the names of the created stimuli in an Excel sheet. Use different columns to include all the information required during the task, such as the modality of the reference and comparison stimuli, the number of repetitions per trial, the stimuli durations, and the expected response (see an exemplary CSV file included in Stimuli_GUI.zip file). Save each of the sets in a comma-separated values (CSV) format.\n\t\tNote: The experiment aims to obtain psychometric functions of the probability of perceiving the test stimuli (i.e., the comparison stimuli) longer than the reference as a function of the variations of the comparison stimuli. Therefore, trials to generate psychometric functions must employ a reference stimulus fixed at half of the range of intervals (i.e., 800 ms). However, to guarantee that the participants’ criteria rely on the reference stimulus, they must always attend to both the reference and the comparison. Therefore, trials of varying references should be included to counterbalance the number of varying comparisons. Finally, consider presenting blocks of V, A, and AV trials to avoid attentional effects. However, always present P and AP trials randomly intercalated.\nCreate a program for automatically running the task using PsychToolbox or PsychoPy, or download and run the automatized 2IFC_Task available at http://www.ifc.unam.mx/investigadores/Luis-lemus (for running in LabVIEW 2014 or higher).\n\t\t\nOpen the 2IFC_Task by double-clicking on the task’s file.\nLoad the created stimuli by selecting the stimulus folder from the Control Panel. First, use the up and down buttons on the dialog box to display a 0. Then, press the folder icon to select the stimulus folder.",
    "Repeat step 1.2.2.2 to set the File Path to 1, 2, 3, or 4 to load the CSV set of trials file, a TXT output file, a WAV background audio, and a cue of a white cross in JPEG format, respectively.\n\t\t\tNote: When programming a task, store data in a convenient format for offline analysis (e.g., in TXT or CSV format). Include information about the trial: the order of appearance and the behavioral outcomes, such as hits, errors, reaction times, and response times.\nPress the White Noise button located on the Control Panel to activate the background noise. Then, place the decibel meter as near as possible to the headphones and set the OS volume control to ~65 dB SPL. Finally, adjust the Background Volume control located on the Control Panel to ~55 dB SPL.\nUse the dialog boxes Pre_S1 and Inter_Stim to specify time-lapses of the first stimulus delivery and of the interstimulus separation, respectively.\n\t\t\tNote: The default times are 1,000 ms. Other graphical indicators are for the examiner to observe results in real-time (e.g., a bar plot of the performance per condition and displays of the number of hits, errors, false alarms, and a current number of trials).\nTest the task by clicking on the Run right arrow icon under the Tools tab and perform some test trials.\n\t\t\tNote: We recommend to use two monitors, one for delivering the task and the other for monitoring the task online.\n\t\t\t\nInitiate each trial by holding the spacebar down after the appearance of the visual cue at the center of the screen. Release the spacebar after the delivery of a pair of stimuli and press the upward or the downward arrow key to finalize the trial.",
    "Repeat step 1.2.2.6.1 until the set is completed. The task stops automatically. Alternatively, abort the task by clicking on the Stop button in the Control Panel menu.\n2. Participants\nRecruit 10 to 30 male and female right-handed participants, with no more than ten years of difference in age between them, with normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and no auditory deficits.\nAsk the participants to fill out a questionnaire regarding their age, gender, handedness, and physical or psychological conditions (e.g., having visual or auditory deficits, musical training, and drug intake).\nTell the participants about the aim, procedures, and duration of the experiment. Be careful no bias is induced (e.g., telling them about the occurrence of P or AP conditions). Then, ask the participants to give written consent to participate in the experiments.\n3. Experimental Procedure\nPerform the experiments in a quiet room with constant lighting.\nRun the task.\nCalibrate the decibel meter and repeat the procedure as described in step 1.2.2.4.\n\tCAUTION: Throughout the experiment, acoustic stimuli should be delivered binaurally at ~65 dB SPL. It is essential to use a decibel meter to test the acoustic amplitudes before the experiment to avoid injuries.\nAsk the participant to sit comfortably in front of the monitor, situated at a distance of 60 cm. Then, place the keyboard at a reachable distance, and adjust the headphones to the participant’s head (Figure 2C).",
    "Instruct the participant to start a trial after the appearance of the visual cue by pressing and holding down the spacebar for the entire trial. Indicate to the participant to release the spacebar after the presentation of two sequential stimuli and to press the upward arrow key if the second stimulus lasted longer than the first, or to press the downward arrow key if it lasted for a shorter period of time (Figure 2B).\nFinally, instruct the participant to use only the right index finger to complete the task, and comment on the possibility of taking a 5-min break in case the participant feels tired or distracted during the experiment.\nTurn on the noise-blocking feature of the headphones and let the participant practice 10 - 15 trials.\n\tNote: During this phase, providing a visual input for correct answers is recommended. Also, it is possible to provide feedback during the experiment; however, be aware of possible biases.\nRun the task.\n4. Data Analysis\nCalculate the mean and the standard error of the mean of the performance of each of the blocks of P and AP, V, A, and AV trials.\nGenerate scatter plots of the probability of perceiving the comparison stimulus longer than the reference as a function of the comparison’s intervals. Then, fit a logistic function to the data.\n\tNote: As noted in the Introduction, selecting a convenient model depends on the experiment and the data. An example of a model is the tanh as reported for the AID task. Such a model delivers four parameters (inset in Figure 3A) defined by:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58408/58408eq3.jpg",
    "The parameter a corresponds to the performance’s magnitude measured from the inflection point to the plateau. The β parameter corresponds to the first derivative at the inflection point. The higher the value, the easier to perceive a transition between longer and shorter, when compared to the reference categories. The parameter θ or X0 is the abscissa value of the projection of the inflection point (i.e., the point of subjective equality). The shifting of such a parameter represents overall temporal biases. Finally, c or Y0 represents the inflection point at the ordinate and reveals biases toward a particular response. Alternative routines for fitting and analyzing psychometric functions are the Palamedes toolbox6 and quickpsy33.\nRepeat the procedure from step 4.1 for analyzing the reaction times and response times.\nPerform statistical analyses to compare the P and AP accuracy distributions within each of the sensory modalities.\nPerform additional analyses, such as Pearson correlations, to find the relationship between periodicity indices and accuracy and between periodicity indices and reaction times.\nSubscription Required.
