    "All animal experiments were approved by the animal welfare committee of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Four-week-old male BALB/c athymic mice were acclimated for a week before the surgery for orthotopic injection of osteosarcoma cells. Mice were housed in individually ventilated mice cages with five mice per cage in a 12-hour light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to SPF feed and sterile water.\n1. Preparation of cells\nOn the day of osteosarcoma cell (143B-Luciferase) injection, wash 80%-90% confluent cells cultured in a 10 cm cell culture dish twice with PBS (pH 7.4) and trypsinize with 1.5 mL of 0.25% trypsin for 3 min. Then, add 6 mL of 10% serum-containing MEM media to quench the trypsin, and collect the cells in a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\n\tNOTE: 143B-Luciferase cell line is obtained from 143B cell line transfect with pLV-luciferase vector23.\nAspirate 20 µL of cell suspension into the chamber of cell counting plate and calculate cell concentration using an automatic cell counter (see Table of Materials).\nCentrifuge the cells at 800 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nAspirate the supernatant with a pipette and resuspend the cell pellet in an 8.5 mg/mL basement membrane matrix (see Table of Materials) to a final concentration of 2 x 107 cells/mL.\nKeeping the cells on ice, bring them to the surgery room. The cells are to be used within 2 h.\n\tNOTE: To avoid inaccurate injection doses (for example, due to the dead space in syringes), an extra cell suspension is prepared (usually two times the required volume of cell suspension). The basement membrane matrix is kept on ice all the time since it has coagulation property above room temperature24.\n2. Surgery for orthotopic injection of the osteosarcoma cells\nNOTE: The surgery tools are shown in Figure 1.",
    "Mice were raised in specific pathogen-free conditions. All procedures were done in an aseptic cabinet with sterile tools.\nAnesthetize the mice by exposing them to 2% isoflurane and 98% oxygen (oxygen flow rate, 2 L/min).\nApply a small amount of ophthalmic ointment on the eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\n\tNOTE: Perform the entire procedure in a well-ventilated area. Before osteosarcoma cell injection, ensure that each mouse is under deep anesthesia by a toe pinch; if the mouse still has responses, such as twitch or jerk, wait for a long time until the above responses disappear.\nKeep each mouse in a supine position. Hold the ankle of the mouse using the thumb and index finger and disinfect the injection site of the tibia with a 70% ethanol swab.\n\tNOTE: To tightly hold the mouse ankle, both the thumb and index fingertips are of great importance for the subsequent procedures.\nRotate the ankle joint of each mouse outward to move the tibia and fibula, and bend the knee joint to a suitable position until the proximal tibia plateau (the top of the tibia) is clearly visible through the skin (Figure 2A).\nAttach the needle to a 1 mL syringe and point the needle tip toward the injection site. Ensure that the syringe needle is parallel to the long axis of the tibia.\n\t\nPercutaneously insert the needle through or adjacent to the patellar ligament as it goes through the skin/joint capsule; th0en, rotate the syringe (1/2 to 3/4-circle) to drill a hole through the tibia platform toward the distal end of the tibia (medullary cavity) for osteosarcoma cell injection with a micro-volume syringe (Figure 2B,C).",
    "NOTE: Simultaneous rotation of the tibia can be felt while drilling if the needle tip is accurate. Ensure the needling moves forward with the syringe rotation rather than being directly pushed forward until about half of the needle is in the tibia.\nCheck whether the syringe needle made a prominent movement into the medullary canal to ensure successful drilling.\n\tNOTE: Perform an X-ray examination (see Table of Materials) to confirm the proper position of the needle and collect the images.\nLoad 143B osteosarcoma cell suspension (from step 1.5) into a micro-volume syringe and replace the 1 mL syringe in the tibia with the 143B cell-loaded micro-volume syringe (Figure 2D). Slowly inject ~10 µL (ignore pre-existing solution in the needle) of 143B cell suspension into each athymic mouse's tibia (about 2 x 105 cells) without applying high pressure.\nPress the injection site with a cotton swab for 20-30 s when the micro-volume syringe is removed.\nPut each mouse back into a clean cage and closely monitor until the mouse is completely recovered from anesthesia (about 10 min).\nMonitor the tumor growth in vivo using an X-ray imaging system. Measure the longer diameter (a) and the short diameter (b) of the cancer mass every week with a caliper for tumor volume (V) calculation: V = 1/2 x a x b2.\n\t​NOTE: Anesthetize the mice by exposing them to 2% isoflurane and 98% oxygen. The mice were anesthetized for x-ray imaging. Intratibia injection of luciferase or fluorescent protein labeled osteosarcoma cells enables tracking of primary and metastatic osteosarcoma lesions.",
    "NOTE: Humane endpoints of the mice with osteosarcoma due to tumor growth of the knee and lung metastasis were based on the following criteria: (1) Body Condition Score, (2) weight loss threshold of 20%, (3) average maximum diameter of tumors of 2 cm, or (4) severely limited animal behavior.\n3. Pathologic examination (collecting primary and pulmonary metastatic osteosarcoma specimen for analysis)\nSix weeks after osteosarcoma cell injection, sacrifice the mice by cervical dislocation after exposing them for CO2 inhalation.\nKeep the mouse in a supine position and stretch both the hind limbs.\nSeparate the whole legs bearing osteosarcoma from the inguinal area.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that all legs are separated from the same anatomical site.\nPrepare the histological specimen of legs bearing osteosarcoma by removing the skin, muscles, and feet, and then fix the specimen of each mouse in a 50 mL tube with 20 mL formalin solution (10%) for 24 h, followed by decalcification in 10% EDTA solution for 14 days with occasional buffer change.\nEmbed the specimen in paraffin and prepare sections for histological examination following previously published work25.\nGently separate the lungs and put them into a 50 mL tube filled with 20 mL formalin solution (10%). After 24 h, transfer the lungs of each mouse into a 15 mL tube with 70% ethanol. Embed the lungs in paraffin for Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemistry assay25.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
