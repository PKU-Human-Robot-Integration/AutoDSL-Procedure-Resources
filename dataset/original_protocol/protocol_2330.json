We have modified the manufacturer’s protocol https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/upload/assets/IM0001320.PDF[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/upload/assets/IM0001320.PDF] in two major ways. First, the original protocol is for brain tissues from mice ≤ 7 days of age, and we have optimized for up to 18 days of age. Secondly, we have expanded the protocol to include dissociation of spinal cord. We tested different dissociation protocols and found that the one detailed below gave the best cell yields (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1939-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Optimization of enzymatic dissociation of neonatal spinal cords\nOne P10 spinal cord was dissociated using each condition.\nTissue harvest.\nRapidly decapitate mouse. For mice P10 and older, administer chemical anesthetics prior to decapitation.\nDissect brain.\nPlace carcass dorsal side up.\nSeparate and cut away skin going from base of neck to nose.\nCut skull from brainstem to olfactory bulb. Remove skull by pulling away to the sides.\nScoop out brain and place in petri dish with cold PBS.\nDissect spinal cord.\nCut and peel back skin to access spinal column.\nDissect out spinal column by cutting through ribs and freeing entire length of the column.\nStarting at the caudal (tail) end of the cord, pinch with blunt ended forceps with wide, serrated tips, and squeeze the cord out by progressively moving the forceps (2 pairs) one over the other until the entire cord comes out of the top of the spinal column.\nPlace in petri dish with cold PBS.\nWhen all dissections are complete, transfer tissues to empty petri dishes. Pool and work with 3 brains or 3 spinal cords at a time.",
    "Chop up tissues to a paste-like consistency using razor blade (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1939-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Dissociation of brain and spinal cord\n(A) Tissues chopped to a paste-like consistency using razor blade.

Left shows brain samples, right shows spinal cord samples.\nNote: To avoid small differences in developmental stage, we exclusively used littermates within experiments.\nDissociation using Miltenyi’s Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit (P).\nAdd 1,950 μL preheated Enzyme mix 1 (50 μL Enzyme P + 1,900 μL Buffer X) to 3 pooled P10 spinal cords. Double the volume for 3 pooled brain samples. Transfer to 15 mL conical tubes.\nIncubate 15 min at 37°C. Mix every 2–3 min by inverting tubes.\nAdd 30 μL Enzyme mix 2 (20 μL Buffer Y + 10 μL Enzyme A) to spinal cord samples. Double the volume for brain samples.\nMix by inverting tubes.\nPipette up and down 10× with 5 mL pipette.\nIncubate 10 min at 37°C. Mix every 2–3 min by inverting tubes.\nPipette up and down 10× with 1 mL tip.\nPlace tubes on ice and let tissues settle for 2 min (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Transfer supernatant (with cells) to fresh 15 mL conical tube. While transferring, pass through pre-wet 70 μm filter.\nBreak up remaining tissue pellet by pipetting up and down 10× with 200 μL tip. Transfer (through filter) to conical tube with cells from step 2h.\nBring up to 10 mL with BSA buffer.\nCount cells with Trypan blue exclusion. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nSpin down cells at 400 × g for 5 min and aspirate supernatant to remove enzyme (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nProceed to O4+ cell isolation.",
    "Critical: Working quickly during dissection and dissociation will yield higher numbers of viable cells.\nO4+ cell isolation\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section of the protocol describes isolating cells expressing the O4 antigen. We begin with diverse cell types dissociated from mouse brains and spinal cords and end with an enriched population of oligodendroglia that express the O4 cell surface sulfatide. O4 is expressed on late stage oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) after the early markers platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα) and neural/glial antigen 2 (NG2) are mostly downregulated and continues to be present on pre-myelinating as well as actively myelinating oligodendrocytes (Ornelas et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Sommer and Schachner, 1981[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Warrington and Pfeiffer, 1992[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). Isolation efficiency using this protocol is 80%–90% (Khandker et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). We have modified the manufacturer’s protocol https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/upload/assets/IM0002007.PDF[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/upload/assets/IM0002007.PDF] for isolation from spinal cords.\nAdd 80 μL of BSA buffer/ 5 × 106 cells. If a sample has more than 5 × 106 cells, split into multiple 1.5 mL tubes. This prevents clogging of columns.\nAdd 10 μL mouse FcR Blocking Reagent to each sample/tube.\nMix well by flicking. Do not vortex. Incubate for 10 min at 4°C.\nAdd 10 μL of Anti-O4 microbeads to each tube.\nMix well by flicking. Do not vortex. Incubate for 15 min at 4°C.\nAdd 1 mL of BSA buffer to each tube.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Aspirate supernatant completely.\nResuspend cells in 1 mL BSA buffer.\nDuring above centrifugation steps, prepare columns.\nSeparate plungers from MS columns. Put aside plungers for future steps.\nPlace columns in the magnetic field of OctoMACS Separator. Verify that column is facing the correct way. If incorrect, the column will not be vertically straight.\nPrepare columns by rinsing with 500 μL BSA buffer.",
    "Add a pre-wet 30 μm filter to each column.\nApply cell suspension onto column filter. Allow entire cell suspension to enter column before proceeding to wash steps. Discard flow-through containing unlabeled cells.\nWash column 3× with 500 μL BSA buffer. Allow entire wash volume to enter column before proceeding to next wash. Discard unlabeled cells that pass through. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nRemove each column from separator and place on collection tube.\nPipette 1 mL BSA buffer into the column.\nImmediately flush out O4+ enriched cells by firmly pushing plunger into the column. Keep cells onice.\nCount cells with trypan blue exclusion and proceed to downstream analyses.\nNote: If greater than 80%–90% isolation efficiency is desired, steps 4–18 may be repeated. This will achieve higher purity of O4+ cells but will yield lower cell numbers.\nNote: Isolation efficiency can be determined by flow cytometry to measure the percentage of O4+ cells (Khandker et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nNote: If isolated cells are used for different downstream analysis, verify that presence of BSA and EDTA will not interfere. When using O4+ cells for single-cell RNA sequencing, we centrifuged isolated O4+ cells and resuspended in 0.04% BSA in PBS, with no EDTA. When extracting RNA or protein, we resuspended in appropriate lysis buffer. When performing the Agilent Seahorse Cell Mito Stress Test, we resuspended in Assay buffer as described below.\nAgilent Seahorse Cell Mito Stress Test\nTiming: 4–5 h",
    "In this step, we will plate the O4+ oligodendroglia isolated above and perform live cell metabolic measurements. The Seahorse Mitochondrial Stress Test evaluates mitochondrial function by measuring oxygen consumption rate (OCR), an indicator of mitochondrial respiration. During the assay, modulators of respiration are added to cells through injection ports, which provides a detailed understanding of cell energetics. Extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), an indicator of glycolysis, is also measured. However, for a complete analysis of energy production through glycolysis, the Seahorse Glycolytic Rate Assay Kit should be used.\nWe have optimized the manufacturer’s protocol https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/XF_Cell_Mito_Stress_Test_Kit_User_Guide.pdf[href=https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/XF_Cell_Mito_Stress_Test_Kit_User_Guide.pdf] specifically for isolated primary oligodendroglia. This included optimization of cell number (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B) and FCCP concentration (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nPrepare cartridge by removing water from wells and adding pre-warmed calibrant. Do this 45–60 min before running assay.\nPrepare Seahorse plate.\nRemove PDL from plate.\nWash 1× with sterile water.\nRemove water completely and allow to dry before plating cells.\nPlate cells.\nIsolate and count O4+ cells as described above.\nCentrifuge cells at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Aspirate supernatant completely.\nResuspend in 540 μL pre-warmed assay media such that there are 40,000 cells/180 μL.\nAdd 180 μL of assay medium only (no cells) to wells A and H. These are background correction wells.\nAdd 180 μL of cell suspension (40,000 cells) to remaining wells B-G.\nCentrifuge plate for 1 min at 400 × g. This will ensure that cells quickly settle to the bottom of the wells.\nPlace cell plate in non-CO2 37°C incubator while completing steps 3–7 below.\nPrepare stock compounds.\nOligomycin: Add 252 μL assay medium to make 50 μM solution.\nFCCP: Add 288 μL assay medium to make 50 μM solution.\nRotenone / Antimycin A: Add 216 μL assay medium to make 25 μM solution.",
    "Pipette each compound up and down 20× to solubilize.\nPrepare working solutions of compounds for loading in sensor cartridge by following Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. For example, add 60 μL of 50 μM oligomycin stock solution to 240 μL of assay media. After addition to cell plate, this will result in a final concentration of 1 μM.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1939_3.csv\nLoad Sensor Cartridge with compounds by following Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. When dispensing compounds into ports, orient the pipette tips at a very slight angle and dispense towards the side wall or corner of the port. Do not push tips completely into the port holes.\nPort A: Oligomycin.\nPort B: FCCP.\nPort C: Rotenone/antimycin A.\nPort D: 20 μL of assay medium or PBS. This port can also be used to test the metabolic effects of an additional drug. If the port is not used for an experimental compound, it cannot be left empty and must be filled with media or buffer in order for all compounds to be dispensed.\nOn the Seahorse XF Mini Analyzer, select XF Cell Mito Stress Test on the Templates window. You can add information about each experimental group on the Plate map tab.\nFor the protocol described here we kept the default parameters for Cell Mito Stress Test (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). To verify, check that the parameters on the Protocol tab are as follows:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1939-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Parameters for Cell Mito Stress Test\nFor each stage (Baseline, Oligomycin, FCCP, Rotenone/Antimycin A), there are 3 cycles, 3 mixes, 0 Wait, and 3 Measurements.\nFor each stage (Baseline, Oligomycin, FCCP, Rotenone/Antimycin A), there are 3 cycles, 3 mixes, 0 Wait, and 3 Measurements.",
    "Start equilibration of Seahorse XF Mini Analyzer by touching “Start Run”. Load the cartridge (hydrated and loaded with compounds) onto the tray when prompted. Ensure the cartridge fits properly, the lid is removed from the cartridge, and the direction of the cartridge matches the image on the screen. Analyzer will complete equilibration in 20 min, then pause until cell plate is loaded.\nNote: We allow the Seahorse XF Mini Analyzer to always remain powered on. If not, switch on Analyzer before beginning animal dissections. Before beginning assay, ensure that the temperature reading is at 37°C.\nRun the Seahorse XF Cell Mito Stress Test.\nTouch “Continue” when you are ready to load your plate.\nThe XF Mini Analyzer tray will open and present the utility plate.\nRemove the utility plate and load the cell plate. Ensure the lid is removed from the cell plate before loading onto the Analyzer tray.\nThe assay takes about 1.5 h to run. Once the assay is complete, touch Eject to retrieve the sensor cartridge and cell plate. The cell plate can then be used for normalization. This step is critical when working with experimental oligodendroglia which may have different cell viabilities. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5], 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7], 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9].\nGently remove media without disturbing cells.\nAdd 50 μL of RIPA lysis buffer with Halt protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail into each well.\nPipette up and down 5× to lyse and mix.\nMeasure total protein/well using standard protein measurement protocols.\nUse total protein measurement to normalize results in Wave as described below.\nPause point: Protein measurement in step 9 can be performed immediately, or the plate can be stored at −80°C after addition of RIPA lysis buffer and analyzed on a later day."
