    "Notes: All procedures can be performed at room temperature unless specified otherwise. In order to avoid contaminations of the sequencing libraries, filter tips and gloves should be used. Surfaces should be cleaned for DNA removal with commercial products at regular intervals. Lab space and instruments for handling samples pre- and post-PCR must be separated physically. Although the protocol worked well (> 40 independent experiments), the authors take no liability for the success of the experiments conducted by the reader.Plant growth and harvestingAbout 100 barley seeds are planted in two pots (16 cm diameter) filled with compost soil. Water thoroughly, and grow the plants for 7 days in a greenhouse (sodium halogen lamps, light period of 16 h, night: 18 °C and day: 21 °C). As an example, growth conditions for barley are given in (Zimmermann et al., 2006). Other plant species may require different conditions. Adapt the plant cultivation accordingly. Use young tissues (unexpanded cells) with a favorable content of nuclei.Grow sufficient plants to obtain about 2.4 g of leaves.Harvest the leaves with scissors. Wrap the leaves in aluminum foil and store on ice for the transport to the lab until ready for next step.Chemical crosslinkingTrim the leaves to 0.5-1.0 cm long segments and transfer about 0.8 g tissue into a 50 ml tube. Prepare 3 tubes and store on ice.Add inside the fume hood 15 ml cold NIBF to each tube. Push a polystyrene plug down to the liquid level for keeping the leaves submersed in the buffer during vacuum infiltration (Hövel et al., 2012) (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180731/20180731193613_8817.jpgFigure 2. Tube setup during vacuum infiltration. A polystyrene plug fitting snugly to the tube is pushed down to the liquid surface area in order to ensure submersion of the leaf segments during the infiltration.",
    "Place tubes in a desiccator and infiltrate the NIBF (150 mbar). Cut the vacuum abruptly after 5, 10 and 15 min to help the entering of the NIBF into the leaf segments. Continue with the infiltration for a total time of 1 h. The green color of segments will be darker after the infiltration (Figure 3) due to the penetration of the fixative into the intercellular space (Hövel et al., 2012) (see Note 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180731/20180731193647_4011.jpgFigure 3. Leaf color change. The image is taken from a typical leaf segment before (A) and after (B) vacuum infiltration with NIBF buffer (fixative). Cut the vacuum, remove the polystyrene plugs and add 2.0 ml of 2 M glycine to stop crosslinking (Hövel et al., 2012). Mix the sample thoroughly by pipetting up and down using a disposable 25 ml plastic pipette. Insert the plugs and apply vacuum (150 mbar) for 5 min.Dispose the plugs and decant the liquid into a waste container. Use a sieve to keep the leaf segments in the 50 ml tube (Figure 4). Wash the leaves three times by adding 40 ml purified water per tube.Dry the segments of each tube well with paper towel and store them on ice until grinding (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180731/20180731193727_8862.jpgFigure 4. Washing and drying of leaf segments after chemical crosslinking. A. Segments are washed with purified water. A sieve is used to withhold the segments in the tube during decantation. B. Leaf segments from each tube (about 0.8 g) are dried thoroughly on a paper towel to facilitate subsequent grinding in liquid nitrogen.Cell disruption and nuclei isolationPrecool mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen (see Note 3). Grind about 0.8 g leaves to a fine powder. Use a metal spoon (precooled in liquid nitrogen) to transfer the powder into a pre-cooled 50 ml plastic tube (Figure 5A).",
    "Close the tube with a lid, which is punctured several times to ensure pressure balance. Store the material immediately at -80 °C. Prepare the remaining 2 tubes accordingly. Process the samples for nuclei isolation within 1 week.Place the 3 tubes containing the powder on ice after removing the tubes from the -80° freezer and add 10 ml NIBP (Hövel et al., 2012) to each tube using a 25 ml plastic pipette. Mix carefully with a pipette to resuspend frozen clumps completely.In order to prevent filters from clogging, distribute the suspension evenly into four funnels prepared in advance (as described below).Filter the suspension at 4 °C through Miracloth and Sefar Nitex placed in a funnel as described (Hövel et al., 2012). Miracloth should face the plant material and Sefar Nitex the funnel surface. Use gravity flow only to avoid contamination with cell debris. Collect the filtrate in a 50 ml plastic tube (Figure 5B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180731/20180731193756_9929.jpgFigure 5. Cell disruption and filtering of nuclei. A. Leaf segments are ground in liquid nitrogen to a fine powder. The material is transferred into a 50 ml tube using a metal spoon and immediately stored at -80 °C. B. For the isolation of nuclei, the powder is resuspended in 10 ml NIBP and filtered through Miracloth and Sefar Nitex. The extract is collected in a clean 50 ml tube for subsequent centrifugation.Spin the four filtrates in a pre-cooled swing-out centrifuge (3,000 x g, 15 min, 4 °C). Discard the supernatant using a 10 ml plastic pipette and resuspend each pale green pellet in 1 ml ice-cold NIBS (Hövel et al., 2012).Transfer the suspension to four 1.5 ml tubes and spin in a pre-cooled centrifuge (1,900 x g, 5 min, 4 °C). Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellets in 300 µl ice-cold NIBS.Prepare four 2.",
    "0 ml tubes each containing 1.5 ml ice-cold sucrose cushion and carefully layer 300 µl of the suspension on top essentially as described (Abdalla et al., 2009) (Figure 6). Spin the four tubes in a pre-cooled centrifuge (16,000 x g, 1 h, 4 °C). Remove the supernatant completely and avoid contaminating the colorless nuclei pellet with the pale green top layer.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180731/20180731193838_4384.jpgFigure 6. Sucrose cushion. The pale green nuclei extract (e) is layered on top of a sucrose cushion (c) and centrifuged in a 2.0 ml tube for further purification.Resuspend each of the four nuclei pellets in 100 µl ice-cold NIBS. Pool two nuclei suspensions (200 µl) in a 1.5 ml tube. Place the two pools on ice and perform a microscopic quality check.Microscopic quality and quantity check of the nuclei (optional)Note: The microscopic check might be skipped, if nuclei are purified in a routine manner, or if an epifluorescence microscope is not available. Stain 7 µl nuclei suspension with 7 µl VECTASHIELD mounting medium with DAPI for the integrity examination (Hövel et al., 2012). Apply the stained sample to a microscopic slide and add the coverslip. Analyze the nuclei using the epifluorescence microscope (100x objective, 1,000-fold magnification, DAPI-filter, absorption 358 nm, emission 461 nm). Intact nuclei appear round or oval and show sharp contours (Figure 7).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180731/20180731193910_5981.jpgFigure 7. Purified barley nuclei. The integrity of barley nuclei following sucrose cushion centrifugation is examined using epifluorescence microscopy (1,000-fold magnification) and staining with DAPI. The scale bar corresponds to 5 µm.Stain another aliquot of the nuclei suspension with VECTASHIELD mounting medium with DAPI for quantification. Count the nuclei using a cell counting chamber (Neubauer chamber) and the epifluorescence microscope (20x objective, 200-fold magnification, DAPI-filter, absorption 358 nm, emission 461 nm).",
    "Determine the concentration of the nuclei and continue the TCC library construction with approximately 107 nuclei.Chromatin biotinylationSpin the two tubes with the nuclei suspension in a pre-cooled centrifuge (1,900 x g, 5 min, 4 °C) and discard the supernatant. Resuspend each pellet in 900 µl ice-cold wash buffer 1 (Kalhor et al., 2011). Spin the sample in a pre-cooled centrifuge (1,900 x g, 5 min, 4 °C) and discard the supernatant.Repeat the washing step with wash buffer 1.Resuspend each pellet with wash buffer 1.

    "Inject slowly to avoid shearing of the DNA (Figure 8). Aspirate most of the remaining air in the cassette, fill 1 L dialysis buffer into a beaker glass, add a magnetic stir bar and dialyze the cassette inserted into a float buoy with slow agitation for 3 h, thereby removing excess IPB from the biotinylation reaction (Kalhor et al., 2011).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180731/20180731193934_8978.jpgFigure 8.

Typical results are shown in Figure 10.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180731/20180731194032_6912.jpgFigure 10. Typical control for marking and ligation of ends. Two close genomic barley HindIII fragments are PCR-amplified across their ligation junction. HindIII-digestion of the amplified 3C junctions, in which HindIII sticky-ends are ligated, yields two fragments of a different size. In contrast, TCC junctions are created from the blunt-end ligation of filled-in and marked HindIII ends. As a result, novel NheI sites are formed and the original HindIII sites are lost (Belton et al., 2012). Typically, approximately 50-80% of the PCR-products are cleaved by NheI. The size of the products is indicated (bp). The gel images are taken from Mascher et al.

Perform PCR using the optimal number of cycles.Reaction clean-up and size selectionPool all PCR-products in one 1.5 ml tube and place the tube in an MPC.Wait for 1 min and transfer the supernatant containing the library into a new 1.5 ml tube for clean-up and size selection (Belton et al., 2012).Determine the volume exactly.Add 1.8 volumes AMPure XP beads (room temperature), mix, incubate (5 min) and reclaim the beads using an MPC (2 min).Wash beads for 30 sec with 190 µl 70% ethanol while the tube is placed in the MPC.Discard the supernatant.Repeat the wash step (Steps N5-N6) once.Air dry beads completely.Remove the tube from the MPC and add 27 µl EBT for elution.Resuspend the beads and incubate (10 min). Tap the tube every 2 min to resuspend the beads.Place the tube in an MPC (1 min) and transfer 25 µl to a new tube.Determine the DNA concentration using the Qubit 2.0 (or Qubit 4) fluorometer and the dsDNA BR Assay. The concentration should be 10-30 ng/µl.",
    "Use a gel-purification to make sure that appropriately sized DNA fragments are used for sequencing (Himmelbach et al., 2014) (see Note 13). Weigh 1 g UltraPure Agarose in a 500 ml Erlenmeyer flask. Add 50 ml 1x TAE buffer and melt the agarose using a microwave until dissolved completely. Cool the liquid to 60 °C, add 5 µl SYBR-Gold (see Note 14), mix gently without forming bubbles and cast the gel using standard electrophoresis equipment. Cover the gel with aluminum foil and let the gel solidify (light-sensitive dye).Transfer 250 ng GeneRuler 50 bp DNA ladder into a tube, add 4 µl 6x loading dye and adjust the volume to 24 µl using EBT. Prepare the TCC sample (25 µl) by adding 5 µl 6x loading dye.Remove the comb and place the gel in an electrophoresis chamber filled with 1x TAE buffer. Load the TCC library in two adjacent slots. Apply the standard to one lane and perform electrophoresis for 1 h with 5 V/cm (distance between anode and cathode). Protect the gel from light during separation. Visualize the DNA using a ‘Dark reader’ transilluminator (see Note 15) and take a photograph. Use a clean scalpel and excise the region between 300 and 550 bp (Figure 12).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180731/20180731194138_7857.jpgFigure 12. Gel-purification of a typical TCC library. Following size-separation (standard 2% agarose gel electrophoresis) and staining with SYBR Gold, the library is revealed using a visible blue light emitting ‘Dark reader transilluminator’. The DNA from the framed area between approximately 300 and 550 bp is extracted for sequencing. The size of the GeneRuler 50 bp DNA ladder (L) is indicated (bp).Place the gel block in a 2.0 ml tube and determine the volume using a balance (e.g., block of 234 mg corresponds to 234 µl).",
    "Purify the DNA using the ‘MinElute Gel Extraction Kit’ essentially as described by the manufacturer. Add 6 volumes QG buffer and dissolve the gel completely under gentle agitation.Add one gel volume isopropanol and mix by inversion.Apply 700 μl of the dissolved gel to a MinElute column. Place the column in a collection tube and spin (16,000 x g, 1 min). Discard the flow-through.Stepwise add the residual liquid to the column (repeat Step N19).Add 740 μl PE to wash the column, incubate for 3 min, spin the column (16,000 x g, 1 min) and discard the flow-through (see Note 16).Turn the column (180°) in the rotor and spin (16,000 x g, 1 min).Discard the collection tube, place the MinElute column into a clean 1.5 ml tube and for elution add 50 μl EB to the resin.Incubate for 1 min and spin the column (16,000 x g, 1 min).Store the eluted TCC library at -20 °C.Quality controls, quantification and sequencingMeasure the DNA concentration using the Qubit 2.0 (or Qubit 4) fluorometer (ds DNA HS Assay). The concentration should be 10-20 ng/µl.Digest 80 ng TCC library with NheI to estimate the fraction derived from ligation of biotinylated junctions (Belton et al., 2012). Set up the reaction by adding to a 1.5 ml tube:80 ng TCC library2 µl 10x Tango buffer1 µl NheI (10 U/µl)Water to a final volume of 20 µlPrepare an uncut control (without NheI digestion). Incubate overnight at 37 °C. Analyse the products with a 2% agarose gel using 2 µl GeneRuler 50 bp DNA ladder as a standard. The smaller size distribution of the digested TCC library provides an estimate for the fraction containing true TCC ligation products (Figure 13).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180731/20180731194158_3808.jpgFigure 13. Quality control of a final TCC library.",
    "After digestion with NheI the TCC library (80 ng) is size-separated (standard 2% agarose gel), stained with ethidium bromide and compared to the uncut control (80 ng). The shift to a smaller size distribution is indicative of the presence of NheI sites, which originate from genuine TCC ligation events (Belton et al., 2012; Mascher et al., 2017). In general, we found that the shift is a secure quality indicator. Libraries without a clear shift should not be sequenced, because they will yield only a very small fraction of useful TCC reads. The size of the GeneRuler 50 bp DNA ladder (L) is indicated (bp).Record the size profile of the library and determine the average size of the TCC library using the Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Figure 14).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180731/20180731194219_4370.jpgFigure 14. Size profile of a typical TCC library. The TCC library is size-fractionated using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The average library size (Region 1: 434 bp; including 121 bp Illumina P5 and P7 adapter) corresponds to an average insert size of about 313 bp. LM: lower marker peak. UM: upper marker peak. FU: fluorescence unit. bp: base pairs.Quantify and sequence the library (paired-end, 2x 100 cycles) using an Illumina system as described (Mascher et al., 2013)."
