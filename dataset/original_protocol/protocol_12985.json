    "1. Prepare metabolomics datasets for analysis\nNOTE: In this demonstration, we use metabolomics datasets without QC sample. Data for case and control groups are needed. For demonstration, we use a public dataset in GNPS database27.\nGo to the webpage https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/gnps-splash.jsp. Click Browse Datasets.\nSearch the keyword \"msv000084112\" in the Title column. Click the dataset ID number for details and download the dataset using FTP.\nPut the raw data in the folder /msv000084112.\n\t​NOTE: This dataset was acquired using C18 RP-UHPLC on Q Exactive platform in positive mode. It represents a cohort with an uncharacterized disease of the metabolism of urine samples data, including 33 samples of healthy people, 12 blank samples, two mixing samples, and 82 samples of patients28 (Supplementary Material 8). To demonstrate the workflow, we randomly chose six samples of healthy people (NH) as a control group and six samples with the disease (NT) as a case group to perform the workflow.\n2. Data format conversion\nNOTE: If the dataset is the raw data generated directly from the mass spectrometer, it is usually in .raw, .wiff or .cdf format. They should be converted to mzXML and mgf formats. Here, we use the msconvert tool in ProteoWizard29 package to do the format conversion.\nDownload the ProteoWizard from https://proteowizard.sourceforge.io/download.html and install it.\nConvert data format using msconvert.exe under the ProteoWizard installation path.\n\t\nConvert the raw data to mzXML format and store them in /mzXML folder:/msconvert.exe /raw/*.raw -o /raw/mzXML/ --filter \"peakPicking true [1,2]\" --filter \"zeroSamples removeExtra\" --mzML --zlib --mz64 --filter \"msLevel 1-2\" --filter \"titleMaker <RunId>.<ScanNumber>.<ScanNumber>. <ChargeState>\".\nConvert the raw/mzXML data to mgf format and store them in /mgf folder:/msconvert.exe /msv000084112/*.raw -o /msv000084112/mgf/ --filter \"peakPicking true [1,2]\" --filter \"zeroSamples removeExtra\" --mgf --mz64 --filter \"msLevel 1-2\" --filter \"titleMaker <RunId>.<ScanNumber>.<ScanNumber>. <ChargeState>\".\n3. Prepare the reference spectral library for the metabolites",
    "NOTE: XY-meta supports the reference spectral libraries only in mgf format.\nGo to the webpage https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/libraries.jsp. Search the keyword “NIST” to find the item. Click View for the details and download the library.\n\tNOTE: GNPS Public Spectral Libraries collected many metabolites libraries, arranged in type, origin, species, and collection modes. Although only a small fraction of these libraries are generated using standard materials, they are usually sufficient for most fundamental research.\nPut the downloaded library GNPS-NIST14-MATCHES.mgf into the /database folder.\n4. Metabolites identification and FDR control\nDownload the XY-meta (Windows version). Find the parameter configuration file parameter.default under the /XY-Meta-Win/config/ folder. Change its content according to Supplementary Material 1.\n\tNOTE: In solution, metabolites often form adducts with anions or cations, which leads to a mass shift of parent ions. Therefore, it is necessary to set the types of adducts. We provided adduct lists for ion exchange column and reverse analytical columns under positive charge mode and negative charge mode in the /adduct folder. Users may also edit their own adduct list according to their research project. The adduct list should be in the same format as the provided list.\nPerform the metabolite identification and FDR control using XY-Meta:XY-Meta.exe -S /XY-Meta-Win/config/parameter.default -D /msv000084112/ pos_wt-1_a.mgf -R /database/GNPS-NIST14-MATCHES.mgf.\n\t​NOTE: XY-Meta does not support wildcards in parameters. Therefore, a single command should be used to process each mgf file. For a large number of files, a batch file is recommended.\n5. Differential analysis\nNOTE: metaX is an open-source R package. Please install it according to the guide at https://github.com/wenbostar/metaX. 8GB RAM is required for this analysis.\nEdit a sampleList.txt file to specify the sample and its corresponding MS data. Please refer to Supplementary Material 2.",
    "NOTE: metaX supports quantitative analysis for the datasets with QC samples. When using QC samples, please modify the class property to NA for QC samples.\nCreate /output folder to store the results of quantitative analysis. Use R to run the script in Supplementary Material 3 to use metaX to quantify the MOCK and WT groups.\n\t​NOTE: Before running the script in Supplementary Material 3, modify the paths in the script to the actual local paths.\n6. Integration of qualitative and quantitative results\nRun the R script in Supplementary Material 4 to annotate the peaks in qualitative and quantitative analysis using metabolite identifications.\n\tNOTE: Before running the script in Supplementary Material 4, please modify the paths in the script to your actual local paths.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
