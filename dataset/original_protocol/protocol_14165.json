    "All procedures involving animals were approved by the ethics committee of Pusan National University (approval number, PNU-2016-1087). A graphical overview of this study is shown in Figure 1.\n1. Preparation and Administration of GRex\nNOTE: The GR used in this study was purchased from a commercial pharmaceutical company.\nPlace 200 g of GR in 2,000 mL of methanol and incubate at room temperature (25 °C) for 5 days.\nFilter the mixture using filter paper with 0.26 mm thickness and 5 µm pore size, and then remove the supernatant. Add 1,000 mL of methanol to the GR residue and filter again.\nCombine the two supernatants, filter through filter paper, concentrate under vacuum, and then freeze-dry the residue to produce GRex.\nDissolve the GRex in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dilute with 0.9% physiological saline, and filter through a 0.45 µm syringe filter. Then, adjust the final concentration of DMSO to < 5%.\nAdminister GRex (300 mg/kg body weight) 1 h after the reperfusion of MCAO via oral gavage. Administer DMSO diluted in physiological saline (10 mL/kg body weight) only to the normal group and control groups, respectively.\n\tNOTE: The concentration of GRex used in this experiment was determined according to the concentration that was active through our previous study8.\n2. Mouse Model of MCAO\nUse male C57BL/6 mice aged 6 weeks and weighing 22-25 g. Provide all animals with free access to standard chow and water, and house them in an environment with controlled temperature (22 ± 1 °C) and a 12 h light/dark cycle.\n\t\nDivide the mice into groups of six mice each, which should consist of sham-operated normal, control, and GRex treatment groups.\nPerform MCAO surgery (modification of the method of Koizumi et al.9) on the control and GRex treatment groups using a stereo-microscope.",
    "Induce inhalation anesthesia in the mice using 2% isoflurane in 70% N2O and 30% O2. Anesthesia is considered sufficient when the mouse becomes unresponsive to mechanical stimulus applied to its tail. Maintain the body temperature of the mice at 36.5 ± 0.5 °C using a body temperature-holding blanket connected to a thermometer.\nRemove all the hair on the chests and necks of the mice by shaving followed by use of hair removal cream, disinfect the surgical site of skin with betadine scrub alternating with alcohol for two times, and then make an incision of approximately 2 cm long with surgical blade in the center of the neck. Carefully isolate the left common carotid artery (LCCA), external carotid artery, and the branch of the internal carotid artery from surrounding connective tissues.\nLigate the external carotid artery and the common carotid artery with a surgical suture (4-0 silk suture, half hitch knot) to temporarily block the blood flow into the internal carotid artery during the operation.\nInsert a silicon-coated nylon suture (8-0 monofilament, 11 mm long) through the internal carotid artery to the origin of the left MCA. Adjust the thickness of the silicon-coated part of the filament to a range of 0.10-0.12 mm.\nMeasure the decrease in relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the MCA using a laser Doppler flowmeter. MCAO will be confirmed when the rCBF is maintained at < 20% of the resting condition values during the entire ischemic period.\nFix the inserted filament to the blood vessel for 2 h while the cerebral artery is occluded, and then carefully withdraw the filament to restore the blood flow for 22 h of reperfusion. Suture the skin by sewing at 5 places (3-0 silk suture, two half hitches knot) and allow each mouse to awaken from the anesthesia.",
    "In the normal group, perform a sham operation following the same procedure above (until 2.4), with the following exception. Ligate the common carotid artery and suture the incised muscle and skin.\n3. Measurement of Volume of Damaged Brain Tissue\nAfter euthanasia of the mice for brain damage measurement with CO2 inhalation, excise the mouse brains 24 h after the onset of MCAO using iris surgical scissors and angled forceps.\n\t\nAfter removing the head using scissors, make an incision in the midline skin of the head to flip over the skin from the skull.\nBreak the parietal bones with angled forceps, peeling off dura matter at the same time, and then isolate the brain carefully from the skull.\nCut the excised tissue into sections (1 mm thick) using a mouse brain matrix, and then stain the sections for 17 min in a solution of 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC).\nFix the sections in 10% formalin for at least 2 h and then photograph them using a digital camera. TTC will be observed to stain viable tissue red while the necrotic areas will be white.\nAnalyze and quantify the cerebral infarct area of each section using ImageJ.\n4. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and Cresyl Violet Staining of Histological Sections\nEuthanize the mice for histological study by CO2 inhalation and perfuse them transcardially with 10 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by 10 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Isolate the brain using the same procedure as above (3.1) and immerse the brain in 10 mL of 30% sucrose overnight.\nEmbed the brain tissue in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound and slice it coronally into 15-µm-thick sections using a cryostat. Mount the sections on glass slides, followed by staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or cresyl violet.",
    "Immerse the glass slides in 80% ethanol for 1 min followed by staining in hematoxylin solution for 5 min.\n\t\nDip the slides in 1% acid alcohol twice, immerse in saturated lithium carbonate solution for 30 s, wash with tap water for 30 s, and then counterstain in eosin solution for 30 s.\nRinse the slides in tap water, soak in 95% and absolute ethanol consecutively.\nAir-dry the slides, clear them in xylene for at least 10 min, and then mount the coverslips using mounting medium.\nPlace the glass slides on a slide warmer for at least 1 h, followed by immersion in 50% ethanol diluted with chloroform overnight.\n\t\nStain the slides with 0.1% cresyl violet for 10 min in a 40 °C dry oven.\nImmerse in 95% ethanol for 30 min, then dehydrate in absolute ethanol for 2 times.\nClear 2 times in xylene for 5 min, then mount with mounting medium after air drying.\nUsing a microscope, observe the histological changes that occurred after MCAO-induced brain injury.\n5. Statistical Analysis\nExpress the experimental results as means ± standard deviation and determine the statistical significance between the groups using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's post hoc analysis using a data analysis software.\nSet the statistical significance at a p-value < 0.05.\nSubscription Required.
