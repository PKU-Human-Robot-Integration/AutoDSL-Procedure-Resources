    "1. Spheroid construction\nAnti-adhesion treatment of the culture plate\n\t\nPipette 100 µL of anti-adhesion reagent into each well of a 48-well plate with a U-shape well bottom, and keep for 10 min. After 10 min, aspirate the coating reagent, and wash twice with sterilized PBS.\nPut the culture plate in an incubator (37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2) until use.\nCell preparation, collection, and counting\n\t\nUse the culture medium specific to the cells to culture the cells in cell-culture flasks (Supplementary Table 2). For example, NCI-H23, CT-26 cells are cultured in RPMI 1640, and HT-29 cells are cultured in McCoy's 5A medium. These two media are supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1% P/S, respectively.\nMaintain all the cells in standard culture conditions (37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2) during proliferation. Here, the NCI-H23 cell line is used as an example in the following steps.\nWash cells cultured in a T25 flask twice with 1x PBS to remove the culture medium (it is better to choose cells in the logarithmic phase and passage the cells at a confluency of 80%-90%).\nTreat the expanded cells with 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin/EDTA for 1- 2 min in an incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Confirm the cell shape (normally circular in this case) under the microscope, and then stop the trypsin treatment. To do this, aspirate the used trypsin/EDTA suspension in the T25 flask, and wash the cells with 4 mL of fresh medium.\nTransfer all of the suspension (5 mL) to a 15 mL tube. Use 1 mL of fresh medium to wash down the residual cells and add it to the tube. Centrifuge the cells at 186.48 x g for 5 min at room temperature.",
    "Remove the supernatant and add 10 mL fresh medium to the cell pellet, followed by gentle pipetting until the cells are in a homogenous suspension.\nAspirate 0.1 mL of cell suspension into a new centrifuge tube, add 0.9 mL of fresh medium, and then pipette the suspension well.\nExtract 10 µL of the cell suspension for cell counting. Carry out this process two or three times and take an average value.\nDilute the suspension to reach a final seeding density of 50,000 cells/mL, according to the concentration obtained from the cell counting process in step 1.2.7.\nCell culture and spheroid formation\n\t\nAdd 200 µL of the cell suspension to each well of a 48-well U-bottom plate.\nWrap the sealing film around the plate and centrifuge it at 119.35 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nCarefully take the plate out of the centrifuge and pull off the protective film. Then, add 5-8 mL of sterilized water into the water channel surrounding the wells (to prevent evaporation) and incubate at 37 °C for 5 days. Do not change/supplement any water to the water channel during the period.\nObserve the cell aggregation during the following 5 days.",
    "NOTE: In general, the cells start to clump as colonies within 5 days. However, the process of spheroid construction may be quicker or slower with different cell types and cell densities. Due to this, the cells must be observed every day using one of three possible methods. First, the cells can be observed through the bottom of the well plate. When the cells have yet not formed a spheroid, a single layer of cells can be seen at the bottom. When the cells form a spheroid, a dense 3D construct can be observed at the U-bottom of each well. Another method involves checking the cells under a microscope. When the cells become a tumor spheroid, the construction involves three layers (a proliferating layer, an inactive layer, and a necrotic core, from the outside to the inside of the spheroid), which have a transparency gradient. Finally, the color of the culture medium can also be used for observational purposes. This can be helpful when the three-layer structure cannot be clearly seen, even using a digital microscope. When the medium turns from purple-red to yellow, the process of embedding the spheroids in the gel can begin. The medium should not be replaced during the cell aggregation period.\nGel embedding\n\tNOTE: The gels need to be stored at a temperature below −20 °C. In particular, gels should be placed far away from the fridge door to avoid temperature fluctuations. Note that the gels are in a frozen state at this stage of the process.\n\t\nTake the frozen gel from the −20 °C fridge and place it on an ice box for the whole time during the experiment.\nObserve the cell spheroids under the microscope. Before the gel embedding begins, the status of the spheroids should again be checked with a digital microscope.",
    "Carefully remove 150 µL of the medium. The plate should also be placed on the ice box.\nEmbed each spheroid in the gel by adding the liquid gel slowly from the wall side of the well while moving the pre-cooled pipette tip around and inside the well. Wait for 5 min and if the gel does not spread evenly, gently pipette the gel with a 10 µL pipette tip. Each well contains a tumor spheroid, 25 µL of 3.5 mg/mL gel, and 50 µL of complete culture medium. Add 75 µL of medium to the controls as well.\n\t\tNOTE: Each well contains one spheroid.\nIncubate the plate at 37 °C for 30 min until hydrogelation is fully completed. Confirm the gelation status under the microscope.\nOverlay 125 µL of the fresh medium on each sample.\nCulture the spheroids for another 7-10 days. Prepare groups of spheroids with four to six wells each and choose at least three of them for analysis.\n\t\t​NOTE: If performing a drug test, prepare two groups for one sample. One group is used for viability testing, while the other is used for image capturing and analysis.\n2. Drug treatment\nDissolve the drug according to the manufacturer's instructions. Prepare 100x working solutions with DMSO. Prepare at least five doses of the drug in serial dilution. Here, the lung cancer therapeutical drug, AMG 510, is used as an example. The composition is shown in Supplementary Table 1.\nUse 0.1% DMSO as a positive control.\nAdd 125 µL of drug-treated medium to each well and place the plate back into the incubator (37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2). At this stage, each well contains a tumor spheroid, 25 µL of 3.5 mg/mL gel, and 175 µL of the medium. The controls contain 200 µL of the medium.",
    "3. Spheroid viability\nMeasure the spheroid viability using an Alamar Blue assay kit according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Measure the viability using a microplate photometer (absorbance at 570 nm and 600 nm) after Alamar Blue treatment is carried out.\nMeasure the viability at day 1, day 4, day 7, and day 10 after embedding the spheroids in the gel, respectively, or as indicated.\n\tNOTE: When using an Alamar Blue assay, at least 16 h of reacting time is required. Therefore, add 20 µL of Alamar Blue in the afternoons of day 0, day 3, day 6, and day 9.\nAspirate 100 µL of the supernatant medium from each well to a new test plate and add 80 µL of fresh medium to each well of the culture plate. Then, replace another 100 µL of the drug-treated medium. Ensure there are no remains of Alamar Blue in the well.\n\t​NOTE: Medium replacement is carried out on each occasion that the viability is tested, and the drug-treated medium of the imaging-analysis groups needs to be replaced on the same day.\n4. Spheroid observation and deep learning analysis through images in the drug test\nImaging\n\t\nAspirate 100 µL of the medium out before imaging.\nPlace the plate on the stage. Obtain digital images of the spheroids using an automated microscope with a 10x objective (2x objective first). The microscope can focus and centralize these spheroids automatically.\n\t\tNOTE: The autofocus function and the algorithm used have been previously reported by Yazdanfar et al.17.\nWait for the automatic imaging. Four images are acquired for each spheroid. An integrated image is formed and processed with the software connected to the high-content imaging system.\nClick on the \"Image patch process\" button and choose the integrated images in the software.",
    "Choose \"U-NET model\", and type in the conversion rate (10x objective images have a conversion rate of 3.966). Click at the bottom of the screen below, to start the image processing. Then, save the diameter, perimeter, and roughness data in spreadsheet software.\nCalculate the excess perimeter index (EPI). The EPI is the ratio between the spheroid perimeter (P0) and the equivalent perimeter (Pe), as calculated by Eq. 1. Measure the area of the spheroid at the focal plane (S) using Image J. Then, calculate the equivalent perimeter of the spheroid using Eq. 2.\n\t\tEPI = (Po− Pe)/Pe       (Eq. 1)\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65125/65125eq01.jpg      (Eq. 2)\n\t\tNOTE: The spheroid perimeter is generated by the software with deep-learning algorithms based on the developed U-NET model.\nAdd 100 µL of fresh medium with the drug and place the plate back into the incubator (37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2).\nSpheroid inhibition\n\t\nCalculate the tumor growth inhibition (TGI) using Eq. 3. The relative spheroid volume (RTV) is the terminal volume over the original volume (Eq. 4). The spheroid volume (V) is calculated automatically by the software using Eq. 5 according to the spheroid diameter output.\n\t\tTGI = (RTVcontrol− RTVtreatment)/RTVcontrol × 100%      (Eq. 3)\n\t\tRTV = Vterminal/Voriginal       (Eq. 4)\n\t\tV = 4/3π(d/2)3      (Eq. 5)\n\t\tNOTE: The TGI is obtained with reference to in vivo growth inhibition, and the tumor weights are replaced with RTV. RTVcontrol is the relative spheroid volume of the control group, RTVtreatment is the relative spheroid volume of the drug tested group, Vterminal is the volume of the spheroid on the last day, Voriginal is the volume of the spheroid on the first culture day, and d represents the spheroid diameter.\nSubscription Required.
