    "1. Preparation of reagents for aniline tagging\nPrepare a 6 M aniline solution at pH 4.5. Working in a hood, combine 550 µL of aniline with 337.5 µL of LCMS grade water and 112.5 µL of 12 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) in a centrifuge tube. Vortex well and store at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: Aniline can be stored at 4 °C for 2 months.\n\tCAUTION: Aniline is highly toxic and should be worked with in a fume hood. Hydrochloric acid is highly corrosive\nPrepare a 6 M 13C aniline solution at pH 4.5. Combine 250 mg of 13C6-aniline with 132 µL of water and 44 µL of 12 M HCl. Vortex well and store at 4 °C.\nPrepare 200 mg/mL N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) solution. Dissolve 2 mg of EDC in 10 µL of water for every sample to be tagged and vortex well.\n\tNOTE: EDC solution should be prepared the same day as the reaction. EDC acts as a catalyst for the derivatization of compounds with aniline12.\n2. Preparation of standards\nMake separate stock solutions of all compounds dissolved in LC/MS grade water (Table 1).\nPreparation of internal standard stock solution\nCombine all compounds except for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), acetyl coenzyme A (ACA), and glycerol 3-phosphate (Gly3P), with the appropriate volumes to create a 2 mM stock solution of all compounds.\nCombine NAD, NADP, FAD, ACA, and Gly3P with the appropriate volumes to create a 2 mM stock solution.\n3. Preparation of sample (Figure 1)\nQuench and precipitate the proteins in a cell-free protein synthesis reaction by adding an equal volume of ice-cold 100% ethanol to the reaction. Centrifuge the sample at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. Transfer the supernatant to a new centrifuge tube.",
    "NOTE: Samples can be stored at -80 °C at this point and analyzed at a later time\n4. Labeling reaction  \nLabeling sample with 12C-aniline solution\nTransfer 6 µL of sample into a new centrifuge tube and bring the volume to 50 µL with water.\n\t\tNOTE: Volume sample size may depend on the specific CFPS reaction.\nAdd 5 µL of 200 mg/mL EDC solution.\nAdd 5 µL of 12C-aniline solution.\n\t\tNOTE: The aniline solution separates into two phases. Mix well before adding to the reaction.\nVortex the reaction with gentle shaking for 2 h at room temperature.\nAfter 2 h, remove the tubes from the shaker and add 1.5 µL of triethylamine (TEA) to the reaction in a fume hood.\n\t\tNOTE: Triethylamine raises the pH of the solution which stops the aniline tagging reaction and stabilizes the compounds.\n\t\tCAUTION: Triethylamine is toxic and causes irritation of the eyes and respiratory tract.\nCentrifuge at 13,500 x g for 3 min.\nLabeling internal standards with 13C-aniline solution\nDilute internal stock solution to 80 µM with a final volume of 50 µL.\n\t\tNOTE: Concentration of internal standards can be adjusted to levels close to the experimental sample.\nAdd 5 µL of 200 mg/mL EDC solution.\nAdd 5 µL of 13C-aniline solution.\nVortex the reaction with gentle shaking for 2 h at room temperature.\nAfter 2 h, remove the tubes from the shaker and add 1.5 µL of TEA to the reaction in a fume hood.\nCentrifuge at 13,500 x g for 3 min.\nCombining tagged internal standard and tagged sample\nMix 25 µL of 12C-aniline labeled sample with 25 µL of 13C-aniline labeled standard.\nTransfer to an auto-sampler vial and analyze by the LC/MS procedure.\nCreating a standard curve for untagged metabolites",
    "Dilute stock solution of untagged metabolites (NAD, NADP, FAD, ACA, and Gly3P) to final concentrations of 320 µM, 80 µM, 20 µM and 5 µM with a volume of 50 µL.\nAdd 5 µL of 200 mg/mL EDC solution.\nAdd 5 µL of 12C-aniline solution.\nVortex the reaction with gentle shaking for 2 h at room temperature.\nAfter 2 h, remove the tubes from the shaker and add 1.5 µL of TEA to the reaction in a fume hood.\nCentrifuge at 13,500 x g for 3 min.\nTransfer supernatant to an auto-sampler vial and analyze by the LC/MS procedure.\n\t\tNOTE: The untagged metabolites follow the same procedure as the sample to replicate the sample matrix in order to maintain similar ionization efficiency.\n5. Setup of LC/MS procedure\nPreparation of solvents\nPrepare 5 mM tri-butylamine (TBA) aqueous solution adjusted to pH 4.75 with acetic acid.\n\t\tNOTE: TBA in the mobile phase helps the analytes achieve good resolution and separation14.\nPrepare 5 mM TBA in acetonitrile (ACN).\nPrepare wash solvent with 5% water and 95% ACN.\nPrepare purge solvent with 95% water and 5% ACN.\nSetup of MS conditions\n\t\nSet the mass spectrometer to negative ion mode with a probe temperature of 520 °C, negative capillary voltage of -0.8 kV, positive capillary voltage of 0.8 kV, and set the software to acquire data at 5 points/s.\nSet selected ion recordings (SIR) for each metabolite with specified cone voltages and mass over charge (m/z) values. See Table 1.\nInitializing LC/MS according to manufacturer’s instructions\nPrime solvent lines in the solvent manager for 3 min.\nPrime wash solvent (5% water, 95% ACN) and purge solvent (95% water, 5% ACN) for 15 s for 5 cycles.\nSet the sample manager to 10 °C.",
    "Install a C18 (1.7µm, 2.1mm x 150mm) column and initialize column with 100% ACN at 0.3 mL/min for 10 min.\nCondition the column at 95% water and 5% ACN at 0.3 mL/min for 10 min prior to introducing solvents with buffers.\nCondition the column at 95% solvent A (5mM TBA aqueous, pH 4.75) and 5% solvent B (5 mM TBA in ACN) at 0.3 mL/min for 10 min.\nSet up a gradient protocol with the elution starting at 95% solvent A and 5% solvent B, raised to 70% solvent B in 10 min, raised to 100% solvent B in 2 min and held at 100% solvent B for 3 min. Return to initial conditions (95% solvent A, 5% solvent B) over 1 min and hold for 9 min to re-equilibrate the column.\nCondition the column with the gradient protocol 3 times prior to any injections onto the column.\nInjecting sample and standards\nInject 5 µL of the sample into the column and acquire the appropriate m/z ion intensities for the 12C-aniline tagged sample.\nInject 5 µL of the same sample again, but this time acquire the m/z ion intensities for the 13C-aniline tagged standards.\n\t\tNOTE: Our LC/MS system is unable to acquire both 12C and 13C m/z intensities at the specified SIR time windows, since it is too much data to acquire in the specified time window. Therefore, we inject the same sample twice.\nInject untagged metabolite standards from lowest concentration to highest and record the appropriate m/z ion intensities.\n6.
