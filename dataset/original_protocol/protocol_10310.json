    "1. Preparation of Paper-based Microfluidic Device Layers\nPrepare patterns for layers of paper, nylon, and adhesive using a graphic design software program.6 Each layer may have a different pattern.\n\tNOTE: The pattern may include alignment holes that are not required for a functional paper-based immunoassay, but assist with the reproducible manufacture of three-dimensional devices. Placement of these holes will differ if devices are assembled individually, in strips, or as full sheets. The software program used to design patterns may vary based on the choice of patterning technique (e.g., photolithography, wax printing, or cutting).6\nSpray the work area with a solution of 70% (v/v) ethanol and water. Wipe the work area with a clean paper towel.\n2. Preparation of Paper Layers: Sample Addition, Conjugate Storage, Incubation, and Wash Layers\nPrepare layers of qualitative filter paper using a large tabletop paper cutter. Cut a stock sheet of paper into a standard paper size to facilitate patterning using a solid ink (wax) printer. For example, a single 460 x 570 mm2 sheet can make 4 sheets of US Letter paper (8.5 x 11 inches2). Handle paper with clean gloves at all times to minimize contamination.\nLoad a cut sheet of chromatography paper into the printer tray. Print previously designed layers (see Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: A pattern can be printed directly onto this sheet using the automatic feed. Only one sheet of paper should be printed at a time to avoid paper jams. For all layers, use the \"Enhanced\" print settings.\n3. Preparation of Nylon Membrane Layer: Capture Layer",
    "Cut the stock roll of nylon membrane into sheets (7.5 x 10 inches2) using a tabletop paper cutter. Take great care in handling the nylon membrane to maintain its integrity and protect against ripping. Store any unused material in a desiccator cabinet, as nylon membranes are moisture sensitive.\n\tNOTE: Cut sheets are narrower than US Letter paper. Because nylon membranes are thin and fragile, they cannot be processed by the printer directly and require support. Details are discussed below.\nUsing a wax printer, print a capture layer pattern onto a piece of copy paper and tape it to a light box to serve as a guide for the positioning of the nylon membrane. The light box aids the alignment of multiple layers.\nPlace a clean sheet of copy paper onto the previously printed sheet of copy paper. Tape the clean sheet of paper to the light box, but do not tape the two sheets together.\nPlace a cut sheet of nylon membrane onto the clean piece of copy paper. Make sure that membrane covers the printed area of the bottom layer of copy paper. Tape all four sides of the nylon membrane to the clean sheet of copy paper.\n\tNOTE: Make sure that the nylon membrane is flat and smooth so that there are no problems with printing (e.g., paper jams or uneven printing of wax). Wax may be printed on the tape where the nylon membrane is attached to the copy paper. If this occurs, areas where nylon is incompletely patterned due to tape coverage should be discarded. For future preparations, larger pieces of nylon membrane can be used to avoid this printing error.",
    "Load a sheet of nylon membrane (supported by the copy paper affixed to it) into the manual feed printer tray. Print only one sheet of nylon membrane at a time.\n\tNOTE: There are no preparation steps required for the blot layer, as it is not patterned.\n4. Creating Hydrophobic Barriers in the Printed Layer\nTape the printed layers onto an acrylic frame for even heating above and below the layer when placed in a gravity convection oven. Keep the nylon membrane taped to the support sheet of copy paper until after the wax is melted and hydrophobic barriers are formed.\n\tNOTE: The acrylic frame is a custom-made, laser cut piece of 1/2\" thick acrylic plastic. Two frame sizes depending on the number of devices being fabricated were used. The outer border of the smaller frame measures 11 5/8\" x 2 3/4\", and the inner hole of the frame measures 10 3/8\" x 1 3/4\". The outer border of the larger frame measures 11 5/8\" x 8 7/8\", and the inner hole of the frame measures 10 1/4\" x 7 7/8\". The open, inner space allows for even melting of wax through the entire thickness of the paper.\nPlace the layers in the oven at 150 °C for 30 sec until the wax melts into the thickness of the paper. Confirm that the wax has permeated the thickness of the paper by turning it over and checking for imperfections in the design.\n\tNOTE: Forced air ovens or hot plates may also be used to melt the solid wax ink. Melting times or temperatures may vary depending on the heating method.\nRemove the paper and nylon membrane from the acrylic frame. Also, remove nylon membrane from support sheet of copy paper.\n5. Preparation of Adhesive Layers",
    "Pattern double-sided sheets of adhesive films using a robotic knife plotter, using design files previously prepared (step 1.1). Protect any exposed adhesive surface using a sheet of wax liner.\n\tNOTE: The double-sided adhesive should be patterned with holes that allow the sample to flow through layers as a continuous fluidic pathway. The wax liner is easily removed from the adhesive, and serves to protect it from contamination and tearing during cutting. A laser cutter or die press may also be used to pattern layers of adhesive films.\n6. Backing of Device Layers with Adhesive\nSpray the light box with a solution of 70% (v/v) ethanol and water. Wipe with a clean paper towel.\nTape a patterned layer of paper or nylon membrane that needs to be backed with adhesive onto the light box with the printed side down.\nPeel one side of protective liner from the patterned sheet of adhesive and affix it to the layer of paper or nylon membrane. Use the light box to ensure proper alignment of patterns. Press together. Place the partially assembled device into a protective slip.\n\tNOTE: The protective slip is a folded piece of lamination film backing that protects the devices from contamination or damage by ensuring that they do not contact the laminator rollers.\nPass the resulting two-layer assembly through an automated laminator to completely press the adhesive and paper together, removing any pockets of air from the adjoined layers.\n\tNOTE: Air pockets between the layers of the device can interfere with device integrity and wicking reproducibility by causing leaks.\n7. Treatment of Conjugate Layer with Reagents for Immunoassays Prior to Device Assembly\nTape conjugate layer onto an acrylic frame such that the hydrophilic zone to be treated is suspended and not in contact with the frame.",
    "Add 2.5 µl of 100 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to the hydrophilic zone on the conjugate layer. Allow it to dry at room temperature for 2 min and then at 65 °C for 5 min.\n\tNOTE: This volume is just enough to wet the zone of the paper. The BSA solution helps to prevent aggregation of the colloidal nanoparticles during the drying process, which will facilitate the release of the nanoparticles when the paper and reagents are rehydrated by the sample.\nAdd 5 µl of 5 O.D. colloidal gold nanoparticle conjugated to anti-β-hCG antibody, and repeat the drying process.\n\tNOTE: The units of concentration of colloidal gold nanoparticles are often expressed as optical density (O.D.) as measured by absorbance at λ = 540 nm. No treatment is required for the wick pad before device assembly in Section 10.\n8. Treatment of Lateral Channel with Reagent for Immunoassays Prior to Device Assembly\nTape lateral channel layer onto an acrylic frame such that the hydrophilic zone to be treated is suspended and not in contact with the frame.\nAdd 10 µl of blocking agent (5 mg/ml non-fat milk and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 in 1x PBS) to treat the lateral channel. Repeat the same drying process (2 min at room temperature and then at 65 °C for 5 min) as the conjugate layer.\n9. Treatment of Capture Layer with Reagents for Immunoassays Prior to Device Assembly\nTape capture layer onto an acrylic frame such that the hydrophilic zone to be treated is suspended and not in contact with the frame.\nTreat the capture layer with 5 µL of 1 mg/ml anti-α-hCG antibody and then allow the sample to dry at room temperature for 2 min followed by 8 min at 65 °C.",
    "Add 2 µL of blocking agent (5 mg/ml non-fat milk and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 in 1x PBS). Repeat the drying process for the capture layer.\n\tNOTE: This amount is appropriate to coat the papers without occluding the pores of the nylon membrane, which can happen when too much blocking agent is used.\n10. Assembly of Three-dimensional Paper-based Microfluidic Devices\nTape the wash layer to the light box (printed side facing upwards). If alignment holes are used, remove them from subsequent layers using a handheld hole-punch tool.\nRemove the protective film on the back of the capture layer to expose the adhesive. Align the capture layer above the wash layer using the alignment holes as a guide. Press the two layers together. Avoid touching hydrophilic zones to minimize contamination or damage to the device. Tweezers may be used to assist assembly.\nRemove the protective film on the back of the incubation layer to expose the adhesive. Align the incubation layer above the capture layer and press them together. Continue adding layers in this manner until all active layers are assembled.\nPlace the partially assembled device into a protective slip and firmly affix the layers together using a laminator.\nRemove the protective film on the back of the wash layer and affix the blot layer to the bottom of the device. Repeat lamination step 10.4 to complete the assembly of the three-dimensional paper-based microfluidic device. Cut desired number of devices from strips or sheets of fully-assembled devices using scissors.\n\tNOTE: Full sheets of devices, strips of devices, or single devices may be prepared using a similar approach.\n11. Performing a Paper-based Immunoassay\nAdd 20 µl of a sample to the hydrophilic zone on top of the device (i.e., the sample layer).",
    "Wait for the sample to wick completely into the device, then add 15 µl of wash buffer (0.05% v/v Tween 20 in 1x phosphate buffered saline). After the first aliquot of wash buffer has wicked completely into the device, add a second 15 µl aliquot of wash buffer.\n\tNOTE: The wash buffer has completely wicked into the device when the liquid droplet has disappeared, showing no meniscus on the surface of the paper. The assay is complete when the second aliquot of wash buffer has completely entered the device.\nTo reveal the results of the assay, peel away the three top layers of the device using tweezers to expose the capture layer.\nInterpret the results of the assay qualitatively by observing the presence or absence of color. Alternatively, image the readout layer using a desktop scanner and use image processing software or algorithms to quantify results and characterize the distributions of intensity within a detection zone.20\nSubscription Required.
