    "Agrobacterium culture and transformationTransformation of competent Agrobacterium cells (EHA101 or EHA105) with binary vector pSMAH638OX/Ubilp (13.8 Kb) constructs (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4143/bioprotoc-11-18-4143-g003.jpgFigure 3. Binary vector pSMAH638OX/Ubilp (13.8 Kb) construct carrying the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (hpt), firefly luciferase reporter gene (luc), spectinomycin (Sp), an attR1 site, the chloramphenicol resistance gene (CmR), the ccdB gene, the attR2 site, and the ZmUbi1 promoter. Thaw 50 μl Agrobacterium competent cells (EHA101 or EH105) on ice (Figure 4A).In 1.5 ml tube, mix 2 µl plasmid DNA (100 picogram/µl) with competent cells.Incubate the cell mixture on ice for 10 min.Perform transformation using the MicroPluserTM (Bio-Rad) electroporation method with the “Agr” mode (Figure 4B).After 10 min, move the cell mixture to the cuvette tube and then the cuvette to chamber slide.Press the Pluse button until a tone sounds indicating that the pulse has been given.Immediately add 250 µl YEP medium to cells.Transfer cells to 25 ml tube containing 3.75 ml YEP medium (Figure 4C).Warp the tube with foil and incubate for 2 h in the dark at 28°C.Centrifuge the mixture at 1,500-3,000 × g for 5 min at RT.Discard around 3.5 ml of the supernatant.Mix the remaining cells gently.Plate 20-100 µl of cells on LB agar amended with 50 mg/L hygromycin and 50 mg/L kanamycin.Make sure that cells are completely dry, then wrap the Petri dish with parafilm and incubate 28°C for 2-3 days.Pick four single colonies and verify the transformation by PCR (Figure 4D).Streak out the positive colonies of Agrobacterium strain EHA101 that harbor the gene of interest in a 1 × 4 grid pattern on a single LB agar containing 50 mg/L hygromycin and 50 mg/L kanamycin (Figure 4E).Incubate the culture for 2-3 days at 28°C.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4143/bioprotoc-11-18-4143-g004.jpgFigure 4.

    "(D-F) Positive transformed Agrobacterium verified by PCR. (G) Mature embryos of Taichung 65. (H) Callus induction after 23 days on N6D medium. (I) Callus infection. (J) Drying calli on sterilized filter paper. (K) Co-cultivated calli on 2N6AS solid medium.Preparing mature embryosSeed surface disinfectionDehusk healthy mature seeds, then hand-cut with a razor. Save the embryo seed halves and discard the endosperm seed halves (Figure 4G).Disinfect the surface of embryogenic seed parts after soaking and stirring once in 70% ethanol for 10 s in a 50 ml tube (up to 150 seeds).Rinse the embryo seeds halves in distilled water for 30 s.Shake the tube vigorously (45 rpm) for 15-20 min in bleach Solution A and then rinse 3-5 times using distilled water.Wash the seed parts with Solution B under vigorous shaking for 15-20 min, followed by five rinses in distilled water up to 30 s each time.Place the sterilized embryo seed halves on sterile filter paper over Petri dish (see Note 3).Callus induction (3-4 weeks)Partially submerge 8-12 disinfected embryo seed halves per dish within N6D callus induction medium.Seal the dishes with surgical tape, then wrap every five dishes with aluminum foil and incubate at 28°C in the dark for 3-4 weeks (see Note 4).Preparation of calli, Agrobacterium suspension, and infection (48 to 72 h)Mix a small portion of four colonies of Agrobacterium strain EH101 on a micro-spatula and resuspend in 40 ml 2N6D-AS liquid medium containing 16 μl acetosyringone (100 mg/ml stock solution) and mix gently (Agrobacterium colonies must be analyzed by PCR using specific primers to verify the integration of the construct with the bacterial gDNA) (Figure 4F).Discard brown calli and seed coleoptile from the N6D medium (at the beginning of week 4). Collect the active embryogenic calli (yellowish-white, relatively dry, 1-3 mm in diameter (Nishimura et al.",
    ", 2006) and globular (Hiei and Komari, 2008) into a 50-ml tube. At this stage, the calli can be used directly for Agrobacterium infection (Figure 4H).Pour the bacterial suspension prepared in Step B3a into the 50-ml tube.Soak the calli in the Agrobacterium suspension and gently mix for 90 s (Figure 4I).Decant the bacterial suspension into a sterilized stainless-steel sieve (12 mesh) and hold in 500-ml sterile beaker.Blot the sieve on sterilized filter paper placed in a 90 mm × 20 mm Petri dish to remove excess Agrobacterium suspension (Figure 4J).Place a sterilized filter paper on solid 2N6D-AS medium. Saturate the filter paper by dripping 0.5 ml 2N6D-AS liquid medium and then co-cultivate an appropriate amount of calli (20-25 calli) on the filter paper (Figure 4K).Seal plates with parafilm tape and wrap with aluminum foil and incubate at 25°C in the dark for 3 days (see Note 5).Wash calli and select transformed cells (3-4 weeks)Collect infected calli in a 50 ml sterile tube and wash with sterile water 3-5 times to remove Agrobacterium (until water is clear). Gently shake the tube and pour out the water.Rinse calli with 40-ml sterile water containing 40 μl carbenicillin 500 mg/ml stock solution to kill Agrobacterium cells.Pour the water suspension and blot the calli on sterile filter paper held over Petri dish. Dry the calli well (see Note 6).Transfer calli onto N6D-HC selection medium; 15 to 20 calli can be placed on a single plate.Seal the plate with surgical tape, and incubate the calli at 28°C in the dark [according to the Toki method; 33°C (light for 10 h)/30°C (dark for 14 h); Saika and Toki (2010)].Check the culture regularly for contamination. In case of contamination, transfer uncontaminated calli to fresh medium immediately.",
    "Subculture the yellowish-white calli to new fresh N2D-HC medium after 10 to 12 days, seal plates with surgical tape, and incubate at 28°C in the dark. Resistant calli (yellowish-white) can be observed after 20-25 days (Figure 5A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4143/bioprotoc-11-18-4143-g005.jpgFigure 5.

(B) Proliferated calli with greening spots. (C) Subculture green pots on the same fresh medium. (D) Rooting. (E) Regenerated plantlets on MS HF medium. (F) Transgenic plants transplanted to soil in the growth chamber. (G-E) Transgenic plants transferred to locking system greenhouse until harvesting. Scale bars: 5 cm in (E), 30 cm in (F), 30 cm in (G), 30 cm in (H).Regeneration of rice transgenic plants (3-4 weeks)Transfer resistant calli to REIII regeneration medium containing suitable antibiotics. Using sterilized forceps, subculture a single callus to each well of 24-multi-well plate. Seal the plate with surgical tape and incubate at 30°C under continuous illumination (Figure 5B). Re-transfer transgenic calli to fresh REIII medium every 10 days with the same conditions. The transformed shoot begins to differentiate after 3-4 weeks (Figure 5C).Transfer 3-4 cm shoots to plantlet pots containing HF medium with appropriate antibiotics at 28°C under 10 h days light (Figure 5D). Several days later, remove the surgical tape from the top of the pots and then remove the pot cover (Figure 5E) (see Note 7).Transplant transformant rice plants to 6.5 cm pots containing rice seedling raising soil, with one plantlet per pot, in a growth chamber at 28°C (Figure 5F).When the transformants are 15 cm tall, transplant them to 23-cm pots containing paddy field soil, with one plantlet per pot, in a greenhouse at 28°C until harvest (Figure 5G-5H).",
