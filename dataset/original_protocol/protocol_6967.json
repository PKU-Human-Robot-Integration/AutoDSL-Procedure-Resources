    "Selecting a cytoduction strategyBefore attempting cytoduction, it is important to consider the genotypes and phenotypes of your donor and recipient strains, and subsequent cells in the procedure (see Figure 1), to determine which cytoduction strategy will work best. The objective is to select for the cytoductants, and against as many other cell types as possible because mating is never 100%, and all cell types depicted in Figure 1 will co-exist after the 10-16 h mating period. The cycloheximide resistant/rho0 strategy, in which the recipient strain is made cycloheximide resistant and rho0, is the most common strategy used for cytoduction of prions. However, if recipient strains have slow growth phenotypes or are respiratory deficient, making these strains cycloheximide resistant or rho0, respectively, can be difficult. Therefore, we provide two alternative strategies that can be used: a rho0 only approach or use of a plasmid for selection (plasmiduction). It should also be acknowledged that the process of plasmiduction can be used to simultaneously introduce prions and a plasmid into a recipient strain, avoiding the need for a separate mating step to introduce the plasmid necessary for verifying prion status. Table 2 summarizes cytoduction strategies and the benefits and drawbacks of each approach.Table 2. Three cytoduction strategies imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210831/20210831230123_4474.pngSelecting cytoductants using the Cycloheximide/rho0 strategyStrain selectionThe donor strain or the recipient strain must contain the kar1 mutation, but this protocol works best when the donor is kar1.For the cytoduction of prions, the donor strain must contain the prion (such as high [PIN+] or weak [PSI+]).Map out the full genotypic information for donor and recipient (Figure 1).Example Donor: MATa, kar1-1, his3, leu2, ura2, URA3, LYS9, TRP1, high [PIN+]Example Recipient: MATα, KAR1, his3-1, LEU2, URA2, ura3-14, lys9Δ, trp1-1, no prionsRecipient must be able to withstand selection for spontaneous cycloheximide resistance and loss of mitochondrial DNA (rho0).",
    "Note: It may not be feasible to use this strategy with slow growing or temperature sensitive strains. Preparing the recipient strainGenerating cycloheximide resistant recessive strains.Grow the desired recipient strain on several YPD plates to generate a thick lawn of actively dividing cells. Incubate plates at 30°C overnight.Note: This thick lawn is best achieved by plating ~150 μl of a 107 suspension of cells on each of several YPD plates using sterile glass beads. Replica plate (see Figure 2 for diagram of replica plating) each independent lawn of cells onto a fresh YPD plate containing 10 μg/ml cycloheximide, and incubate at room temperature (RT) for up to two weeks until rare colonies appear.Note: To avoid desiccation, make sure plates are approximately 6-7 mm thick, and incubation is done in a ‘humidity chamber’ containing several soaked paper towels in a plastic container with a breathable or unsealed lid. Use of replica plating from a thick lawn of actively dividing cells substantially increases the likelihood of obtaining cycloheximide resistant cells relative to directly plating even a dense quantity of log-phase cell culture onto the YPD+cycloheximide plates. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4146/bioprotoc-11-17-4146-g002.jpgFigure 2. Diagram of replica plating. A. Replica plating requires sterile velvets, a replica plater, and sterile plates. Use of replica plating elsewhere in this protocol is analogous to the process shown here, with key differences indicated in those locations. B. Grow cells as a thick lawn (a red-colored yeast strain is shown as an example). A thickly poured fresh YPD+Cycloheximide (abbreviated YPD+Cyh within the figure) plate will also be needed. C. The thick lawn of cells will be placed onto the sterile velvet and lightly transferred with gentle pressure on the top of the plate (D). E.",
    "The fresh YPD+Cyh plate will be placed onto the velvet, and gentle pressure on top of the plate will transfer the cells (F).Colonies that grow on cycloheximide plates should represent rare mutations.Verify cycloheximide resistance by re-streaking colonies on a new YPD+cycloheximide plate. Incubate plates at 30°C for 2-3 days. Time required for colony development at this verification step should be comparable to that normally observed for your recipient strain.To verify that the cycloheximide resistant mutation is recessive, the mutation must be scored in the diploid state. To generate diploids, your strain of interest and tester strain (see Materials and Reagents, 4.e.) must be freshly grown. On separate YPD plates, use a sterile toothpick to spread a thin film of each strain into a 2 × 2 cm “patch.” Incubate plates at 30°C overnight. To mate the strains, use a sterile toothpick to pick a small amount of each strain and mix in one patch on a fresh YPD plate. Incubate plates at 30°C overnight. To select for diploids, streak mated cells for single colonies onto plates that will select against each of the haploids, but maintain the diploid. Using the example recipient strain as defined above, and BY4741 (Mata, his3, leu2, ura3, met15) as the tester, diploids could be selected on SD-Leu. Incubate plates at 30°C for 2-3 days until individual colonies develop. To score for cycloheximide resistance, patch a few colonies onto YPD+cycloheximide vs. YPD. Diploids should grow on YPD, but not on YPD+cycloheximide, because recessive mutations will not confer resistance to the diploid.Generating rho0 recipient cellsGrow recipient strains, preferably after making strains cycloheximide resistant, by streaking for a single colony on YPD plates containing 25 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Ethidium bromide is a mutagen and potential carcinogen, so handle plates with gloves. Incubate plates at 30°C for 3-5 days.",
    "Note: Ethidium bromide treatment will induce mitochondrial DNA loss, and colonies will be small. Verify strains are rho0 by streaking on YPD and YPGlycerol. Colonies will be small or “petite” on YPD and will not grow on YPGlycerol.Mating and selection of cytoductantsUsing a sterile toothpick, spread the cycloheximide resistant rho0 recipient strain in one or more long horizontal lines on a YPD plate, as shown in Figure 3. Incubate at 30°C 1-2 days.Note: The recipient strain will grow very slowly; it is best to make thick patches or grow for two days. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4146/bioprotoc-11-17-4146-g003.jpgFigure 3. Schematic of mating strategy using a rho0, cycloheximide resistant recipient strain. Donor strains are spread on plates in one or more vertical lines, and recipient strains are spread on a separate plate in one or more horizontal lines. After growth, use a sterile velveteen to replica plate donor strains onto a fresh YPD plate. Use a second sterile velveteen to replica plate the recipient strain in a crisscross pattern over the donor. Allow strains to mate, and then replica plate onto a YPGlycerol+cycloheximide plate. Only cytoductants are able to grow and will appear at the intersections where donor and recipient mating occurred. Colonies usually appear after 7 days of growth.Spread a thin film of the donor strain in one or more long vertical lines on another YPD plate, as shown in Figure 3. Incubate at 30°C overnight.Using a replica plater and a sterile velveteen, velvet the donor strain onto a fresh YPD plate.Using a fresh sterile velveteen, velvet the recipient strain in a crisscross pattern over donor strain as shown in Figure 3.Incubate plates at 30°C for approximately 10-16 h.",
    "Optional: Microscopically monitoring for “shmoos” or directional projection morphology can be performed at approximately 6 h to provide a positive indicator that the strains will mate successfully; for more detail on shmoo morphology, see Merlini et al. (2013). Replica plate the mated cells onto a YPGlycerol 10 μg/ml cycloheximide plate, and incubate at 30°C.Note: Because of selection pressures, colony appearance often takes up to seven days, as described above in Step B2a ii. Verify colonies are cytoductants by replica plating or streaking on selective media to confirm the presence of recipient specific auxotrophic markers, and the ability to grow on YPGlycerol plates. Using the example provided above and depicted in Figure 1, cytoductants will grow on YPGlycerol, YPD+cycloheximide, and SD-Leu, but not on SD-Lys, SD-Ura, or SD-Trp.Confirming the presence of the prionThe presence of a prion should be confirmed in two different ways: the presence of fluorescent aggregates and prion loss by growth on guanidine hydrochloride. These confirmations can be pursued simultaneously.Determining the presence of a prion through fluorescent aggregates.Transform your tester strain (Materials and Reagents, 4.e., meeting all conditions i.-iv.) using standard transformation protocols (Gietz, 2014) with a plasmid that encodes the prion domain or full-length prion protein, fused to a fluorescent tag (GFP, RFP, etc.), under a conditional promoter.1)Several plasmids are available through addgene.org, such as pCup1-Sup35-GFP and pCUP1-Rnq1-YFP; see Materials and Reagents 5 for plasmid numbers.2)For the purposes of this example, we will use a prion-free version of BY4741 (Mata, his3, leu2, ura3, met15) as the tester strain and a plasmid containing a URA3 selectable marker. Additionally, BY4741 has been shown to carry a [PIN+] variant (Manogaran et al., 2010), so for use as a tester, it was cured of all prions on YPD containing guanidine hydrochloride.",
    "Prepare cytoductants and the transformed tester strain for mating by generating fresh plates of actively growing cells. Use a sterile toothpick to spread a thin film of plasmid containing tester cells into a 2 × 2 cm “patch” on a fresh plasmid selective plate (such as SD-Ura). Do the same with the recipient strain on a YPD plate. Incubate plates at 30°C overnight.On a fresh YPD plate, use a sterile toothpick to mix both the recipient and tester strain in one patch. Incubate plates at 30°C overnight.After mating, streak cells for a single colony on media that selects for the diploid and the plasmid. Using the example recipient strain, as well as a BY4741 tester carrying a URA3 selectable plasmid, cells can be streaked on SD-Leu-Ura to select for diploids retaining the plasmid. Incubate at 30°C for 2-3 days until single colonies appear.Pick single colonies from selective plates and grow at 30°C overnight in liquid culture that will maintain the plasmid (e.g., SD-Ura in the example given). As a control, grow a liquid culture of haploid tester containing the plasmid (from Step B4a i above). This will repeat confirmation that the tester strain does not carry the prion and provide cells grown in parallel as a visual control when scoring cytoductants for fluorescent aggregates in Step B4a vii. below.To induce expression of the fluorescently tagged prion protein via the CUP1 promoter, add copper sulfate to a final concentration of 50 μM, and grow at 30°C for an additional 4-6 h.Use a fluorescent microscope to observe cells for fluorescent aggregates (Figure 4).Note: Cells expressing the plasmid but that do not contain the prion, such as your haploid tester strain control, will have diffuse fluorescence (Figure 4). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4146/bioprotoc-11-17-4146-g004.jpgFigure 4.",
    "Fluorescent microscope images of cells with diffuse fluorescence versus aggregates indicating presence of the prion. Transient expression of Sup35-GFP or Rnq1-GFP in cured strains exhibit diffuse fluorescence, similar to the image on the left. In the presence of a prion, fluorescent puncta are observed. The right panel shows transient expression of Rnq1-GFP in a BY4741 strain with high [PIN+] [from Dorweiler et al. (2020)].Curing of Hsp104-dependent prions by guanidine hydrochloride.Note: If you are working with prions that require an alternative method for curing, such as [GAR+] or [SMAUG+], that curing method must be used instead of the method described here. Consult literature describing your prion of interest to determine the appropriate curing method to use. Patch haploid cytoductants (rather than diploids generated in Step B4a) on YPD media containing 5 mM guanidine hydrochloride. Incubate for 1-2 days at 30°C.Repeat by taking patched cells and making another patch on a fresh YPD 5 mM guanidine hydrochloride plate. Incubate for 1-2 days at 30°C.Note: While two successive patches often results in curing most cells, it is recommended to repeat the patching for a total of three times. Using a fresh toothpick, streak cells on a YPD plate and incubate at 30°C until single colonies appear.To verify loss of the prion, score for the presence of fluorescent aggregates (as described in Step B4a).Selecting cytoductants using the rho0 strategyStrain selectionThe donor strain or the recipient strain must contain the kar1 mutation.For the cytoduction of prions, the donor strain must contain the prion (such as high [PIN+] or weak [PSI+]).Map out the full genotypic information for the donor, recipient, and all subsequent cells in the cytoduction scheme / diagram (see Figure 1).Example Donor: MATa, kar1-1, his3, leu2, ura2, URA3, LYS9, TRP1, high [PIN+].Example Recipient: MATα, KAR1, his3-1, LEU2, URA2, ura3-14, lys9Δ, trp1-1, no prions.",
    "Donor should differ from the recipient by 1 or more auxotrophic or antibiotic markers (leu2 in the example given) to successfully distinguish cytoductants from other cells in the scheme.Recipient strain must not be respiration deficient (unless already rho0).Generate rho0 recipient cells as described in Step B2bMating and selection of cytoductantsNote: Because this strategy offers no direct selection against the heterokaryon, it is advised not to use the crisscross method described in Figure 3. Instead, mated cells will be streaked for single colonies in Step C3d. Prepare cells for mating by generating fresh plates of actively growing cells. Use a sterile toothpick to spread a thin film of donor cells into a 2 × 2 cm “patch” on a fresh YPD plate. Do the same with the recipient strain on another YPD plate. Incubate plates at 30°C overnight.Note: The recipient strain will grow slowly, and it is best if more cells are patched for growth. On a fresh YPD plate, use a sterile toothpick to mix both the recipient and donor strain in one patch.Incubate plates at 30°C for approximately 10-16 h.Notes: The presence of shmoos can be verified as described in Step B3e. Mating of strains beyond 16 h generates an excessive amount of heterokaryons that take over the culture, which may reduce the frequency of cytoductants obtained in Step C3e below. Streak mated cells on synthetic glycerol (SGlycerol) plates that select against the donor strain (Using the example -leu donor strain, SGlycerol-Leu), and incubate at 30°C for 3-5 days until single colonies appear.Pick single colonies and patch onto fresh selective SGlycerol plates (SGlycerol-Leu for example donor). Incubate at 30°C.Note: It is advisable to pick at least 20 colonies, given that both heterokaryons and cytoductants will be present on the selective SGlycerol plates.",
    "When selecting colonies, avoid large colonies; these large colonies tend to be heterokaryons. To screen for cytoductant specific markers, replica plate patches from Step C3e to the appropriate media. This process is analogous to that shown in Figure 2, with the exception that the plate used in Figure 2D would contain individual patches of several cytoductants (prepared in Step C3e), and several selective plates would be sequentially printed from that velveteen (Figure 2F). Importantly, mark the orientation of all replicate plates to ensure consistent scoring of each independent cytoductant. The cytoductants will be rho+. Therefore, using the example above, cytoductants will grow on YPGlycerol and SD-Leu, but not on SD-Lys, SD-Ura, or SD-Trp. If strains grow on SD-Ura, these are heterokaryons.Confirming the presence of the prionTo confirm the presence of the prion, follow Step B4.Selecting cytoductants using the plasmiduction strategyStrain selectionThe donor strain or the recipient strain must contain the kar1 mutation.For the cytoduction of prions, the donor strain must contain the prion (such as high [PIN+] or weak [PSI+]).Map out the full genotypic information for donor, recipient, and all subsequent cells in the cytoduction scheme/diagram (see Figure 1).Example Donor: MATa, kar1-1, his3, leu2, ura2, URA3, LYS9, TRP1, high [PIN+].Example Recipient: MATα, KAR1, his3-1, LEU2, URA2, ura3-14, lys9Δ, trp1-1, no prions.Note: Donor and recipient must share at least one auxotrophic marker such that both strains can maintain selection for a plasmid encoding that specific marker (e.g., his3 in this example). While neither of the above strains can grow on media lacking uracil, a URA3 plasmid can only complement this deficiency in the recipient strain. Preparing the donor strainTransform the donor strain with a plasmid that can also be maintained with selection in the recipient (in the example above, it would be a HIS3 plasmid), using standard transformation protocols (Gietz, 2014).",
    "Mating and selection of plasmiductantsNote: Because this strategy offers no direct selection against the heterokaryon, it is advised not to use the crisscross method described in Figure 3. Instead, mated cells will be streaked for single colonies in Step D3d. Prepare cells for mating by generating fresh plates of actively growing cells. Use a sterile toothpick to spread a thin film of plasmid containing donor cells into a 2 × 2 cm “patch” on a fresh plasmid selective plate (such as SD-His). Do the same with the recipient strain on a YPD plate. Incubate plates at 30°C overnight.On a fresh YPD plate, use a sterile toothpick to mix both the recipient and donor strain in one patch.Incubate plates at 30°C for approximately 10-16 h.Note: The presence of shmoos can be verified as described in Step B3e. Mating of strains beyond 16 h can result in plasmid loss due to the absence of selective pressure, and can generate excessive proportions of heterokaryons that take over the culture, both of which may reduce the frequency of cytoductants obtained in Step D3e below. After mating, streak cells for a single colony on a media that selects against the recipient strain and the donor strain. In the case above, because all but the recipient strain will now contain a HIS3 plasmid, and the donor strain is leu-, matings can be streaked on SD-Leu-His. Incubate at 30°C for 2-3 days until single colonies appear.Pick single colonies and patch onto fresh media that again selects against the donor and recipient strain. Incubate at 30°C.Note: It is advisable to pick at least 20 colonies, given that both heterokaryons and cytoductants will be present on the selective plates. When selecting colonies, avoid large colonies; these large colonies tend to be heterokaryons.",
    "To screen for cytoductant specific markers, replica plate patches to media providing both positive and negative selection. This process is analogous to that shown in Figure 2, with the exception that the plate used in Figure 2D would contain individual patches of several cytoductants (prepared in Step D3e), and several selective plates would be sequentially printed from that velveteen (Figure 2F). Importantly, mark the orientation of all replicate plates to ensure consistent scoring of each independent cytoductant. Using the example provided above, along with a HIS3 plasmid, cytoductants will be His+ and Leu+, whereas any strains that grow on SD-Ura are heterokaryons. Therefore, cytoductants will grow on SD-Leu and SD-His, but not on SD-Lys, SD-Ura, or SD-Trp.Confirming the presence of the prionTo confirm the presence of the prion, follow Step B4.If the plasmid used for plasmiduction carries the fluorescently tagged prion, it is not necessary to mate cytoductants with a tester strain (as described in Steps B4a i-iv), but immediately proceed with screening cytoductants for the presence of fluorescent aggregates (as described in Steps B4a v-vii). Cuing the prion can be performed on YPD+GuHCl (as described in Step B4b). However, it is important to recognize that curing can also lead to plasmid loss. Therefore, screening afterwards via fluorescent aggregates may require subsequent selection for rare cells still carrying the plasmid, transformation, or mating with the tester strain carrying the plasmid to verify loss of prion aggregates (as described in Step B4b iv). An alternative option involves curing the prion on synthetic media that will maintain the plasmid, but note that this requires using a lower concentration of GuHCl (3 mM instead of 5) and thus requires additional passes for successful curing."
