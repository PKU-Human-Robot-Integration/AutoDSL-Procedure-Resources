Cover the BC solution with foil.\nPrepare 300 µL of 0.4 mg/mL IR-783 in filtered deionized water in a 1.5 mL microtube. Place this microtube on a vortex mixer at 1,500 rpm.\nAdd 20 µL of the BC solution in DMSO to the IR-783 solution over 10 s at a constant rate using a 20 µL pipette. The end of the pipette tip should touch the inner wall of the microtube (Figure 1B).\nKeep the microtube on the vortex mixer for an additional 30 s to obtain the IR783/BC NP solution. Then, place the nanoparticle solution on a rack fully covered with foil.\nCentrifuge the resulting IR783/BC NP solution for 10 min at 2,000 x g and 4 °C to remove aggregates. Collect the supernatant, leaving ~20 µL in the tube to avoid disturbing the pellet. Discard the pellet.\nCentrifuge the supernatant twice for 30 min at 30,000 x g and 4 °C and collect the nanoparticle precipitate from both the centrifugations. Resuspend the nanoparticles in 300 µL of 1x PBS.",
    "NOTE: When the hydrophobic BC prodrug in DMSO is dispersed in water with vortexing, the DMSO is dissolved by water, and the prodrug molecules tend to form nanoscale assemblies to keep themselves stable under the local supersaturation situation24.\nQuantify the content of IR-783 and BC by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), using the elution method shown in Table 1.\n\tNOTE: The HPLC sample is prepared by mixing equal volumes of nanoparticle solution and acetonitrile.

The HPLC column is an analytical 4.6 mm (inner diameter) x 100 mm (length) C18 column, with a 2.7 µm particle size and 120 Å pore size.\nCalculate the prodrug encapsulation efficiency (EE%) and loading capacity (LC%) according to the following equations:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64677/64677eq01v4.jpg\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\nTime (min),Acetonitrile (%),Water (%)\n0,20,80\n5,20,80\n30,95,5\n35,95,5\nTable 1: HPLC method for qualitative and quantitative analysis of BC prodrug and its photocleavage. Reproduced with permission25. Copyright 2022, Wiley.\n3. Characterization of IR783/BC NPs\nMeasure the average size of the IR783/BC NPs with a dynamic light scattering (DLS) instrument (see Table of Materials). Add 200 µL of IR783/BC NP solution in a cuvette and insert the cuvette in the holder for measurement. Set the measurement type as 'size' and measurement temperature as 25 °C. Perform three measurements with a duration of 20 s for each measurement.\nMeasure the surface charge of the IR783/BC NPs with the DLS instrument using a zeta-potential test cuvette.\n\t\nDilute 25 µL of IR783/BC NP solution with 725 µL of deionized water in a 1.5 mL microtube and add the solution into a zeta-potential test cuvette. Place the cuvette in the sample groove. Cap the sample groove.",
    "Set the measurement type as 'zeta-potential' and measurement temperature as 25 °C. Perform 10 measurements.\nPrepare the samples for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging. Add 10 µL of IR783/BC NP solution on a piece of holey carbon film on a copper grid (300 mesh) and remove 7 µL. Leave 3 µL of solution on the film overnight for auto-evaporation.\n\tNOTE: Adding 10 µL of the NP solution followed by the removal of 7 µL allows the droplet to cover a broader area on the film.\n4. Photoactivation of IR783/BC NPs\nSet up an LED lamp (530 nm; see Table of Materials) with an iron stand so that the light directly faces the operating floor. Place an integrating sphere photodiode photometer (see Table of Materials) directly under the LED lamp.\n\tNOTE: To prevent the influence of environmental light, all light irradiation experiments are conducted in a darkroom.\nTurn on the LED lamp and open the cap of the photometer. Record the irradiance and set the lamp parameters using the associated software (see Table of Materials). Adjust the input current (mA) to set the irradiance as 50 mW/cm2.\n\tNOTE: The irradiance is also affected by the distance between the LED lamp and photometer. In the setup used here (Figure 3A,B), the distance is fixed at 5 cm.\nDilute the IR783/BC NP solution with deionized water to 50 µM based on BC concentration. Add 200 µL of the IR783/BC NP solution into a 1.5 mL microtube. Place the tube on a foam block with a groove fitting size of the microtube and the same height as the photometer in step 4.1 (Figure 3C,D).\nOpen the cap of the tube. Turn on the LED lamp and irradiate the nanoparticle solution for 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 min.",
    "Quantify BC consumption and Cb release by HPLC after light irradiation.

Testing cytotoxicity of IR783/BC NPs with and without light irradiation\nCulture HCT116 cells (human colorectal tumor cell line) in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (complete medium) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C (~2 x 106 cells per dish in a 90 mm cell culture dish). Routinely subculture the cells every 2-3 days.\n\tNOTE: HCT116 is a human colon cell line. Compared to other cancer cells such as HeLa, MCF7, and A549 cells, HCT-116 cells express a higher level of caveolin-125, which can be targeted by IR783 and enhance the cellular uptake of IR783/BC NPs.\nPlate the HCT116 cells in 96-well plates with RPMI 1640 complete medium at a density of 104 cells per well.\n\t\nAspirate the medium from the culture dish when the cell confluency exceeds 50%. Wash the cells with 1x PBS and remove the PBS. Add 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin solution and incubate at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nAfter 3 min, add 2 mL of complete medium to quench trypsin digestion. Resuspend the cells, transfer the cell suspension into a 15 mL centrifugation tube, and centrifuge at 300 x g for 3 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of complete medium.\nDilute 10 µL of the cell suspension to 200 µL with complete medium. Place 10 µL on a hemocytometer and cap it with a coverslip.\nObserve the hemocytometer under a microscope (eyepiece: 10x; objective lens: 4x). Count and record the cell numbers at the four corner squares and the center. Calculate the cell concentration using the formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64677/64677eq05.jpg",
    "Where n = the average of the cell numbers of the five squares.\nDilute the cell suspension to 1 x 105 cells/mL. Add 100 µL of the cell suspension per well in a 96-well plate to seed the cells. Add 100 µL of PBS per well in the unseeded wells.\nTreat the cells with (1) 0.1-150 µM free BC, (2) 0.1-150 µM IR783/BC NPs (based on BC concentration), (3) 0.1-150 µM free BC with light irradiation, or (4) 0.1-150 µM IR783/BC NPs (based on BC concentration) with light irradiation. Incubate the cells at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 6 h.\n\tNOTE: The free BC and IR783/BC NP solutions are diluted from their respective stock solutions with complete medium.\nAfter 6 h of incubation, replace the prodrug/nanoparticles-containing medium with fresh complete medium. Incubate the non-irradiation Groups 1 and 2 in the dark for 24 h. For Groups 3 and 4, irradiate the cells with a 530 nm LED lamp (50 mW/cm2) for 5 min, and incubate for 24 h.\n\tNOTE: Cell plates are placed on a foam block to ensure the same height as the photometer in step 4.1.\nDetermine the cell viability with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay.\n\t\nAfter the BC or nanoparticle treatment, add 10 µL of MTT (10 mg/mL in PBS) to each well and incubate the plates at 37 °C for 3 h. Then, remove the medium and add 100 µL of DMSO to each well. Read the absorbance with a microplate reader at 490 nm, 570 nm, and 630 nm.\nCalculate the cell viability using the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64677/64677eq06v2.jpg\n\t\tNOTE: Four independent experiments (n = 4) of each group are conducted for analysis. OD490 can be replaced by OD570-OD630 in calculation of cell viability.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
