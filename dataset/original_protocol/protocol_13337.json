    "This procedure was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee of the National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi. The serial reference number of the approval is IAEC#480/18. The experiments were performed in accordance with the regulation guidelines of the Committee for Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Government of India, under the supervision of a professional Veterinarian at the SAF, NII.\n1. Preparation\nDilate the rodent eyes using a drop of 0.8% tropicamide and 5% phenylephrine ophthalmic solutions in each eye. Place the animal in a dark area for 30 min before the procedure.\n\tNOTE: An analgesic is not required as the animal is euthanized immediately after completing the 30 min. The dark adaptation and dilating the animal's eyes allow the observer to check for ocular tears and damage before the procedure. Additionally, dilation is advantageous while working with the pigmented eyeball tissue.\nEuthanize the animal by intraperitoneally administering a 5x dose of anesthesia. A typical dose is 200 µL of PBS containing 10 mg of ketamine and 1 mg of xylazine.\n\tNOTE: The dose for euthanizing the animal is ketamine at 400-500 mg/kg body weight and xylazine at 50 mg/kg body weight given intraperitoneally. For a typical mouse weighing 20 g, the dose would be 200 µL of PBS containing 10 mg of ketamine (100 µL of a stock solution of 100 mg/mL ketamine) and 1 mg of xylazine (100 µL of a stock solution of 10 mg/mL xylazine).\nConfirm the complete lack of response to a stimulus by examining the pedal reflex. The absence of a heartbeat and respiration are also important indicators.\nPlace the mouse in lateral recumbency to allow complete access to the eye.",
    "Prepare Colibri suturing forceps, curved forceps, a micro-blade (15°, 3 mm in size), spring micro-scissors, and angled spring micro-scissors ready for the procedure.\n2. Enucleation of the mouse eye along with the third eyelid\nPlace the mouse in lateral recumbency to allow for complete access to the eye. Open the outer eyelids with the forceps to optimally visualize the third eyelid.\n\tNOTE: The third eyelid, also known as the nictitating membrane, is located toward the upper corner of the nasal tangent (Figure 1A).\nIdentify the third eyelid as a minor translucent protuberance with a pigmented boundary (Figure 1B).\nPlace curved forceps around the eyeball, and pinch to free the eye from extraneous attachments. This will minimize bleeding into the eye from the surrounding tissue.\nReplace the curved forceps with spring micro-scissors, and cut around the eyeball with the third eyelid attached to it. Use small continuous cuts to release the eyeball from the surrounding tissue attachments.\nPlace curved spring micro-scissors under the eyeball to free the eye by cutting the optic nerve. Ensure that the eyeball is completely released from the eye socket.\n3. Clearing the extraneous tissue\nPlace the enucleated eye from the euthanized mouse in a Petri dish with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer at pH 7.4, with the Petri dish filled such that the eyeball is submerged in PBS.\nImmobilize the enucleated eyeball of the mouse with the attached third eyelid with one hand using forceps.\nSuspend the eyeball in liquid medium to permit more efficient handling. Some extraocular muscles or tissues will begin to float away from the eyeball. Remove them by cutting them off the eyeball using spring micro-scissors.\nCut and remove the optic nerve from the base of the eyeball using micro-scissors to allow the better separation of the retina for whole-mount preparations.",
    "NOTE: It is not necessary to remove the optic nerve for tissue sectioning.\nWash the eyeball with PBS, and transfer it into a 1.5 mL tube containing 1 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for a minimum of 2 h at 4 °C for tissue fixation.\n\tNOTE: The procedure can be paused at this step by leaving the tissue in PFA for up to 12 h at 4 °C. However, for the isolation of live cells, the fixation steps should not be performed, and the entire procedure needs to be performed without pauses.\n4. Dissection of the enucleated eye to obtain the anterior and posterior eyecups\nAfter the PFA fixation (if collecting live cells, proceed without the fixation of the eyeball), transfer the eyeball into a Petri dish containing PBS, and place it under a dissecting microscope to perform the subsequent procedure.\nImmobilize the eyeball by holding down the third eyelid firmly with Colibri suturing forceps.\nMake a small incision at the limbus by piercing it using a micro-blade. The limbus is the corneal-scleral junction. Make the incision preferably opposite the third eyelid, thereby making an access point for the spring micro-scissors.\n\tNOTE: Using a microblade of 15° and 3 mm in size may provide better control over the depth of this incision.\nNext, using this incision as a starting point, with a pair of micro-scissors, make small and continuous cuts along the circumference of the corneal-scleral limbus. First, complete a semicircle of cuts starting from the incision point to the third eyelid. Then, complete the remaining semicircle of cuts on the other side. Finally, make a cut around the third eyelid to separate the posterior cup and the anterior cup.",
    "NOTE: Depending on the eyecup of interest, the nictitating membrane can be left attached to either the anterior or posterior eyecup.\nRemove the lens from the posterior cup using forceps to obtain the posterior cup comprising the neural retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) layers. The lens, posterior cup, and anterior cup of the eye are, thus, separated.\n\tNOTE: If working with unfixed tissues, the anterior and posterior cups can now be enzymatically digested to obtain a corneal or retinal single-cell suspension.\nFor fixing the tissues, transfer these cups into a 1.5 mL tube containing 1 mL of 4% PFA for 12 h at 4 °C.\n\t​NOTE: Post-fixation, the tissue can be embedded in an appropriate medium, and cryo-sectioning or paraffin sectioning can be done to obtain corneal or retinal sections.\n5. Isolation of the neural retina and RPE layers\nReintroduce the posterior cup into the Petri dish containing PBS buffer to submerge the tissue.\nCheck for the presence of the neural retina. This can be visualized as an opaque layer on the pigmented RPE layer, which is attached at the peripheral circumference of the cup.\nHold the third eyelid with forceps to immobilize the posterior cup, and peel off the neural retina starting from the periphery using a second pair of forceps.\n\tNOTE: Very gentle and slight movements of the hand are highly recommended in order to not damage the tissue. At the optic nerve exit, the curved spring scissors can be inserted under the neural retina, and a cut can be made to completely free the layers if the neural retina remains attached as depicted in Figure 3. Optionally, free or detach the retina with gentle strokes using a soft brush. However, it would not be appropriate to do so if collecting the retina for histology.",
    "​NOTE: The neural retina and pigmented RPE layer with the third eyelid are, thus, obtained.\n6. Segmentation of retinal and RPE layers for wholemounts\nReintroduce the anterior and posterior cups into the Petri dish containing PBS buffer, and place the dish under the dissecting microscope.\nImmobilize the anterior cup by holding down the third eyelid.\nUse angled spring micro-scissors to make a cut of around 3/4 of the diameter of the eyecup next to the third eyelid, cutting from the periphery perpendicularly toward the optic center.\nMaintain a grip on the third eyelid, and make a cut next to the first cut.\nMake a similar cut between the second cut and the third eyelid.\n\tNOTE: Three or four such equidistant cuts open the hemispherical cups into a flower shape, which falls flat and can be easily mounted.\nImmobilize the posterior cup by holding down the third eyelid.\nFollow the same steps as given for making the cuts (steps 6.3-6.5) on the anterior cup to make three or four equidistant cuts on the posterior cup.\n\tNOTE: For the histology of the neural retina isolated in step 5, make similar cuts to ensure it falls flat on a surface. Do not make very deep cuts to the center of the cup, as this may make the leaf sections fall apart or separate easily.\nPerform the staining, and whole-mount the tissues for effective visualization7,8.\n\tNOTE: The presence of the nictitating membrane acts as a constant physical indicator of the nasal side of the eyecup in wholemounts. It helps to demarcate the dorsal/ventral side of the eyecup, as the third eyelid of the eyecup indicates the nasal/ventral orientation.\nSubscription Required.
