    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCell seeding – 1st day\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step is very important to equalize the number of cells in every sample. This will improve the reproducibility of the experiments. The following steps must be done under sterile conditions.\nResuspend the cells in the culture flask for equal distribution (due to gravity, these cells fall to the bottom of the cell culture flask but remain in suspension) and transfer them into a 50 mL Falcon tube.\nPipette a volume of 50 μL cell suspension into a 1.5 mL centrifugation tube.\nCount the cells with a Neubauer counting chamber. Calculate the number of cells per mL.\nNote: Certain leukemic cells fall to the bottom of the flask and must be resuspended more vigorously (for example, we see this with erythroleukemic HEL cells). Solid tumor-derived cells usually attach to the bottoms of flasks and must be detached by trypsinization.\nNote: Prepare a dilution of the cell suspension with PBS for more reliable cell counting results. For MV4-11 cells, a dilution of 1:2 works best (this step can be done under non-sterile conditions because the counted cells shall not go back to the main culture). Add 50 μL PBS to the cell suspension and make sure that the cells are resuspended thoroughly.\nSeed 0.75 × 106 cells per mL in a final volume of 4 mL in a 6 well plate (final number of cells per sample: 3 × 106 cells in 4 mL medium). This will yield material for about two immunoblot analyses and one flow cytometry analysis.\nCalculate for 3 samples: siRNA control, siRNA against FLT3, and one additional sample to facilitate accurate pipetting. In total, 9 × 106 cells are necessary.",
    "Centrifuge the 9 × 106 cells in a 50 mL Falcon tube for 5 min at 200 × g and room temperature (15°C up to 25°C).\nDuring the centrifugation step, prepare a 6 well plate with 3 mL fresh complete growth medium for the samples that will be electroporated and place it in the incubator to prewarm the media.\nAfter centrifugation, aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 3 mL fresh complete growth medium thoroughly (1 mL for every sample) by pipetting.\nAdd 1 mL cell suspension to every well of the prewarmed media in the 6 well plate. Thus, you will have two wells with 3 × 106 cells each.\nLet the cells adapt overnight (approximately 16 h), incubate them at 37°C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere.\nNote: The cell line MV4-11 should be cultured at a density between 0.3 × 10ˆ6 and 0.5 × 10ˆ6 cells per mL to achieve the best growth. This gives a volume of 18–30 mL of cell suspension, i.e., a volume that fits in a 50 mL Falcon tube.\nNote: The optimal cell numbers for electroporation must be adjusted for every cell line. For different leukemia cell lines, cell numbers between 2 × 106 to 3 × 106 cells per sample usually gives good results.\nCritical: Make sure that the medium that is used for electroporation does not contain antibiotics. All buffers and media should have room temperature (15°C up to 25°C) to not stress the cells.\nTransfection of cells – 2nd day\nTiming: 1 h\nThe following part is the key step. The siRNA is transferred into the cells. All steps are done under sterile conditions.\nPrepare a NeonTM Electroporation tube with 3 mL Electrolytic Buffer E2 and place it in the transfection unit as shown in Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A–3C.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1801-Fig3.jpg",
    "Figure 3. Correct placement of NeonTM Electroporation tube\nIt is very important to place the electroporation tube correctly in the pipette unit.\n(A) Prepare the electroporation tube with 3 mL Electrolytic Buffer E2.\n(B) Place the tube in the pipette unit. Make sure that it is placed correctly. You can feel it click into place.\n(C) The tube is correctly placed when there is no large gap under the tube in the unit.\nNote: The NeonTM Electroporation tube can be used several times. It is highly advisable to renew the Electrolytic Buffer E2 between different siRNAs and when using different cell lines.\nPrepare the cells for electroporation. Transfer the cells from the 6 well plate into 15 mL conical centrifugation tubes.\nResuspend the cells in the well thoroughly and transfer them with a 1 mL pipette into the centrifugation tube.\nWash each well with 1 mL PBS and transfer it into the tube as well.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 200 × g at room temperature (15°C up to 25°C).\nAspirate the supernatant with a vacuum pump and resuspend the cells in 2 mL PBS.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 200 × g at room temperature (15°C up to 25°C).\nDuring centrifugation, prepare a 6 well plate with 2 mL complete media per sample and place it in the incubator to warm the media.\nAspirate the supernatant to remove remaining FBS and resuspend the cells in 100 μL resuspension buffer R from the Thermo Fisher transfection kit.",
    "Note: It is very important to aspirate the supernatant very thoroughly. This can be done with a 1 mL pipette if there is no vacuum pump available. A significant excess of PBS leads to strong dilution of the resuspension buffer R. The NeonTM Electroporation Pipette is adjusted for exactly 100 μL; excess of PBS leads to a loss of cells that can be electroporated.\nTransfer the cells in the electroporation buffer into a 1.5 mL conical centrifugation tube.\nAdd 100 pmol siRNA to the cells. A stock concentration of 10 μM is used for siRNAs (recommended by the manufacturer), so add 10 μL to the cells.\nNote: This concentration of siRNA is useful to decrease several proteins in our hands. To transfect cells by electroporation, higher amounts of siRNA are necessary than for liquid-/polymer-based transfection protocols. It is necessary to adjust the concentration for every siRNA of interest and for each cell type.\nUse the Neon Electroporation Pipette and place the cells in the electroporation unit as shown in Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B (see also troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]). Use the following settings for electroporation of MV4-11 cells.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1801-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Correct placement of the NeonTM Pipette\nThe correct placement of the electroporation tip is required for the proper working of the electroporation device.\n(A) There should be no gap between the electroporation tube and the pipette.\n(B) If the pipette is placed correctly, you can feel it click into place.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1801_5.csv",
    "Note: The Neon™ Tips can be used several times. Change the tips between different cell lines and different siRNAs. It is possible to use the same tip for siRNA control first and siRNA of interest second. It is necessary to adjust the correct settings for every cell line. Thermo Fisher provides a database with protocols of selected cell lines (https://www.thermofisher.com/de/de/home/life-science/cell-culture/transfection/neon-transfection-system/neon-transfection-system-cell-line-data.html[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/de/de/home/life-science/cell-culture/transfection/neon-transfection-system/neon-transfection-system-cell-line-data.html]). Even if the cell line of interest is not listed, the database can help to establish the correct settings.\nCritical: Other settings can be more useful for other leukemic cell types. We effectively decrease proteins by electroporation and RNAi in MOLM-13 acute myeloid leukemia cells (voltage: 1,600 V, width: 10 ms, 3 pulses), in RS4-11 B cell precursor leukemia cells (voltage: 1,750 V, width: 20 ms, 1 pulse), and in HEL erythroleukemia cells (voltage: 1,400 V, width: 20 ms, 2 pulses). For K562 chronic myeloid leukemia cells and NB4 promyelocytic leukemia cells, see our recent publications (Pons et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7], 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nTransfer the cells into the 6 well plate (as shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]) with the prewarmed medium. Let the cells adapt overnight (approximately 16 h).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1801-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Transfer of electroporated cells into 6 well plate\nStimulation/incubation of cells – 3rd day\nTiming: 1 h\nAfter adaption time, count and reseed the cells as necessary for the experiment of interest. In this protocol, the cells are analyzed using immunoblot. The following steps are done under sterile conditions in a clean bench.\nCount the cells using a Neubauer counting chamber as described in step 1.",
    "Seed 0.2 × 106 cells per mL in a final volume of 5 mL in complete medium (final number of cells per sample: 1 × 106 cells in 5 mL medium). Pipette the volume of 1 × 106 cells in a 6 well plate and adjust a final volume of 5 mL with complete medium in every well.\nCritical: It is advisable not to stress the cells. Avoid any centrifugation steps because the cells are very sensitive after electroporation. It is recommended to test the viability of the cells after electroporation; for example, by flow cytometry using annexin V/propidium iodide staining for early and late apoptotic events (Beyer et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). The samples can be divided in the experiment and a small amount of 1 mL cell suspension can be used to evaluate apoptosis or cell cycle distribution. The control transfected samples typically show viability of over 80%. If the cells show a high apoptosis rate see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nLet the cells adapt for at least 1 h before stimulation (e.g., with drugs if necessary) or let the cells incubate overnight (approximately 16 h) at 37°C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere before harvesting.\nNote: For MV4-11 cells, incubation of 48 h after electroporation gives the best results regarding knock-down efficiency. Using another cell line, the ideal time for gene silencing must be identified.\nNote: This protocol is not only working for siRNA. It can also be used for plasmids and the CRISPR-Cas9 technology. It can likewise be used to decrease RNAs of interest, e.g., miRNAs or long non-coding RNAs with known or to be identified biological functions.\nHarvesting and lysis of cells – 4th day\nTiming: 2 h",
    "In this protocol, the cells are analyzed by immunoblot. The following steps can be done under non-sterile conditions and must be performed on ice if indicated.\nCell harvest.\nTransfer the cells from the 6 well plate into conical 15 mL centrifugation tubes.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 800 × g at room temperature (15°C up to 25°C).\nAspirate the supernatants with a vacuum pump and a Pasteur pipette or with a 1 mL pipette. Resuspend the cells in 1 mL PBS and transfer the cells into 1.5 mL centrifugation tubes.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 800 × g at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatants thoroughly.\nNote: Make sure that there is as little PBS left as possible after aspiration. A high excess of PBS will dilute the lysis buffer and lead to incomplete cell lysis.\nCell lysis.\nAdd an appropriate amount of complete NET-N lysis buffer (i.e., containing protease/phosphatase inhibitors and DTT) to the cells. As rule of thumb add around 100 μL of complete NET-N lysis buffer to 1 × 106 cells.\nLyse the cells for 30 min on ice.\nSonicate the samples for 10 s and an amplitude of 40%. This shears DNA and thereby facilitates the loading of protein samples into the SDS-PAGE gel. Benzonase might alternatively be used to shear DNA.\nCentrifuge the tubes for 25 min at 17,000 × g at 4°C.\nDetermination of protein concentration and final sample preparation.\nTransfer the supernatants into new 1.5 mL centrifugation tubes and determine protein concentrations (e.g., Bradford or BCA assays).\nEqualize the amount of protein in every sample and add 6× sample buffer to a final concentration of 1× buffer.\nDenature the proteins by boiling for 5 min at 95°C.",
    "Note: Certain proteins do not tolerate boiling for 5 min at 95°C. If necessary, reduce boiling time and/or temperature.\nNote: If cytosolic fractions are collected, shearing/degradation of genomic DNA is not necessary. Together with nuclear proteins, it will remain in the centrifuged nuclear fraction; see (Göder et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) for further details.\nPause point: After preparing the lysates and boiling, it is possible to continue the next day. You can freeze the samples at – 20°C for several weeks, until running the immunoblot.\nRun immunoblot and analyze the proteins of interest. For complete details on the use and execution of performing an immunoblot, please refer to (Beyer et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nNote: Primary antibodies are prepared in TBS-T buffer with 2% skim milk powder; dilutions of antibodies are listed in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]. Secondary antibodies are prepared in TBS-T buffer.\nAlternatives: The high starting numbers of cells for this experiment provide the ability to perform other experiments of interest after gene silencing."
