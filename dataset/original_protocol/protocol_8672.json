    "Ethics Statement: All protocols were approved by the Dartmouth Institutional Biosafety and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee review boards.\n1. Protocol for Designing a Guide Strand (sgRNA) for CRISPR/Cas9 Retrovirus\nNOTE: There are many non-profit websites that can be used to generate sgRNAs to target a gene of interest (https://benchling.com/ and http://crispr.mit.edu/).  The goal of this protocol is to design and order single stranded oligos from a commercial vendor that are annealed to each other. This annealed oligo will be ligated into the PXL transfer vector. See supplemental video 1 for an example of designing sgRNAs using Benchling.\nUse a website dedicated to designing sgRNAs.\n\tNOTE: For example, inputting a coding/exonic sequence from near the start of the gene of interest into the website will generate a 20 nucleotide sgRNA. Use the 20 nucleotide sgRNA sequence to design the sense and anti-sense oligos that will be ordered to create the sgRNA.\nAfter generating the sgRNA, copy this sequence into a word processor. Add a G (guanine) to the beginning of the 20 nucleotide sgRNA sequence in the document if it does not already begin with one (i.e., G-20 nucleotide sgRNA sequence). This is necessary to ensure good transcription off the U6 promoter.\nDocument the reverse complement of this now 20-21 nucleotide sequence. For the sense oligo, add \"CACC\" to the 5' end of the sequence in the document (i.e., CACC-G-20 nucleotide sgRNA sequence). This overhang will be used to ligate the sequence into the PXL vector.\nFor the antisense oligo, add AAAC to the 5' end. Use this overhang to ligate the sequence into the PXL vector.",
    "Obtain the sense and antisense oligos. After receiving the oligos, make 100 μM stocks using DNAse free water. Mix together 10 µl each of the 100 μM sense and antisense oligos with 4 µl of 10x NEB Buffer 2, and 16 µl of water.\n\tNOTE: They do not need page purification or 5'phosphorylation (as the BbsI overhangs are non-compatible cohesive ends).\n\t\nBring 200 ml of water to a boil in a 500 ml beaker, then float the tube containing this mixture in a foam \"floater\" holder. Allow the water to slowly cool from 95 °C for 2 hr at room temperature.\nDilute the now annealed-oligo mix 1:1,000 in sterile water and use immediately in the following ligation or store the remaining reaction at -20 °C.\nDigest pXL, a PX330 vector derivative, with the BbsI restriction enzyme at 37 °C for 2 hr. Use a 40 µl reaction containing 2 µg of pXL, 4 µl of 10x NEB Buffer 2, 1 µl of Bbs1 and balance water. Subject the digested-pXL to routine gel purification using a commercial kit. Ensure that the yield is ~8.5 kB product.\nUsing a commercial ligation kit, ligate 1 µl of the 1:1,000 annealed-oligos with 50 ng of digested and gel purified-pXL. Transform the ligation product into competent recombination deficient E. coli (NEB 5-alpha, subcloning efficiency). Screen the transformants for the presence of the correct guide by plasmid DNA sequencing.\nDigest the U6, guide strand, and RNA scaffold elements (sgRNA) out of pXL using BstB1 and Pac1 restriction enzymes and ligate into the fluorescent protein-T2A-Cas9 viral backbone digested with the same restriction enzymes. Transform the ligation product (NEB 5-alpha maximum efficiency). The fluorescent protein-T2A-Cas9 viral backbone plasmids are low copy plasmids and thus low copy protocols must be used.",
    "NOTE: A second sgRNA can be similarly introduced by PacI digestion of another pXL guide strand plasmid and ligated into the Pac1 digested and calf-intestinal phosphatase treated viral backbone already containing the first guide strand. Phosphatase treatment of the viral transfer plasmid will help reduce the number of transformants from the self-ligation of plasmids not containing the second guide.\nSequence verify the final plasmid and maxi prep using the Nucleobond Xtra maxi prep kit and package it into a virus using the following \"Protocol for Retro/Lentiviral Production — CaPO4 Method\".\n2. Prepare 293FT/293GP Cells for Transfection (Retro/Lentiviral Production — CaPO4 Method)\n(Day 1) Rapidly thaw 1 vial of cells per 10 cm cell culture plate in a 37 °C water bath. For lentiviral packaging, use 293FT cells. For retroviral packaging, use 293GP (gag/pol) cells.\nPipette all of the thawed-cells from the cryo tube into a 15 ml conical tube and add 2 ml of pre-warmed CO2 equilibrated-complete Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium.\nCentrifuge cells for 5 min at 500 x g to pellet. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 10 ml of complete Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium. Plate the cells onto a 10 cm cell culture dish. Incubate the cells overnight at 37 °C in a 5% carbon dioxide incubator.\n(Day 2) 24 hr after plating, change media on the plate by aspirating the existing media and adding 10 ml of pre-warmed Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium to the plate.\n\t\n(Day 3-4) 24-48 hr after the media change and once the cells become confluent, split the cells to a confluency of 2.5-3.0 x 106 cells/plate (10 cm plate).",
    "To split the cells, aspirate the media and wash the plate with 5 ml of PBS. Add 1 ml of 0.25% trypsin to the plate and incubate at 37 °C until the cells lift off the plate. Add 0.5 ml of Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium to neutralize the 0.25% trypsin reaction and pipette the cells into a 1.5 ml tube.\nSpin the cells at 500 x g for 5 min. Resuspend the cells in 1 ml of Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium. Dilute 10 µl of cells in 90 µl of PBS. Count the cells using either a hemocytometer or automated cell counter. Re-plate 2.5-3.0 x 106 cells/plate with complete Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium.\n\t\tNOTE: Cells will be ~50% confluent 24-34 hr after plating. Transfect the cells when they are ~50% confluent.\n3. (Day 5) CaPO4 Transfection and Viral Particle Collection\nChange the media 2 hr prior to transfection by aspirating the existing media and adding 10 ml of pre-warmed Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium. Ensure that there is exactly 10 ml of media in the 10 cm plate.\nPrepare the transfection reagents for 2 dishes using 2, 5 ml round bottom polystyrene tubes. Label the first tube \"DNA\" and the second tube \"2X HBS\". Adjust the concentration of DNA to 1μg/μl in Tris-EDTA at pH 7.4.\n\t\nFor lentiviruses, slowly add 20 μl of transfer vector (the viral construct of interest), 13 μl of CMVdelta8.9, 9 μl of VSV-g , 860 μl of molecular biology grade H2O, and 100 μl of 2.5 M CaCl2 to the first tube (\"DNA\") while continuously tapping on the tube to mix.\nFor retroviruses, omit the CMVdelta8.9 plasmid. Add 20 µl Transfer Vector, 15 μl VSV-g, 860 μl Molecular Biology Grade H2O, and 100 μl 2.5 M CaCl2 to the tube labeled \"DNA\".",
    "Add 1 ml of 2x HEPES-buffered saline (pH 7.0; this pH is absolutely critical) to the tube labeled \"2X HBS\".\nSlowly add the 1 ml contents of the \"DNA\" tube to the \"2X HBS\" tube, one drop at a time. Continuously tap the \"2X HBS\" tube with the index or middle finger while adding the contents of the \"DNA\" tube. Observe apparent CaPO4 vesicles after each drop. Incubate the tube in the dark for 30 min at room temperature.\nAdd 1 ml of the transfection in slow droplets to each 10 cm cell plate, then incubate overnight at 37 °C.\n(Day 6) Replace media with 8 ml of Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium + 0.5% FBS and 40 mg Caffeine/100 ml media. If the transfer vector contains a fluorescent marker, then fluorophore expression indicates a successful transfection.\n(Day 7) Collect the media containing the viral particles by using a 10 ml serological pipette and dispense into a 50 ml conical tube. Store the 50 ml conical tube at 4 °C. Add 8 ml of 0.5% FBS media to each plate.\n\t\n(Day 8) Again, collect the media containing the viral particles and combine with the previous day's harvest in the 50 ml conical tube.\n4. Concentration and Purification of the Virus\nMake a 5x polyethylene glycol 6000 solution by adding 40% polyethylene glycol 6000 and 1.5 M NaCl to ddH2O. Autoclave the solution on the liquid cycle for 45 min at 121 °C. Slowly mix the solution when cooling.\n\tNOTE: The solution will start cloudy and then become clear as it cools.",
    "Centrifuge the 50 ml conical tube containing both collections of viral supernatant at 2,000 x g for 10 min in order to pellet insoluble material. Purify the viral media by filtering through a 0.45 µm low protein binding syringe filter (PES or PVDF).\nAdd 5x polyethylene glycol 6000 solution to media (The final concentration should be 8% polyethylene glycol 6000 and 0.3 M NaCl). Mix by inverting the tube several times (do not vortex). Incubate the viral containing polyethylene glycol solution at 4 °C for 12 or more hr, remixing occasionally.\n(Day 9) Centrifuge the viral containing polyethylene glycol solution at 2,500 x g for 45 min. Remove and discard the supernatant and spin again for 2 min. Again, remove and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet by adding 320 µl of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (the 320 µl is 1/100th of the original volume of viral containing media collected) and incubate overnight at 4 °C. Optionally, resuspend the pellet at room temperature on a rocker for 30 min.\nAfter re-suspending the pellet, aliquot the virus (5-10 µl per 0.5 ml tube) and freeze aliquots at -80 °C (freeze thawing or storage at 4 °C will dramatically reduce the titer).\nTiter the viruses using standard protocols, i.e., perform a dilution series on a 6-well plate of HEK293T cells and manually count fluorescent colonies 48 hr later.\n5. Testing Efficacy of the CRISPR Virus\nNOTE: Sequence clones using the following steps to test for production of double-strand breaks repaired by NHEJ using the mouse Neuro2A cells. This has the advantage over surveyor assays in that it can be used to determine the percentage of cells that have been modified and the nature of the indels resulting from NHEJ.",
    "Coat a 3.5 cm cell culture dish with a gelatinous protein mixture such as matrigel diluted 1:50 in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C. Aspirate the gelatinous protein mixture and plate the Neuro2A cells.\nAfter the Neuro2A cells reach 50% confluence, add the CRISPR Lentivirus or Retrovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 10 (i.e., 10 viral particles per cell).\n\tNOTE: Neuro2A cells are not as amiable to infection as are HEK293 cells, thus, a single infection will not result in 100% of the cells being infected with the lentivirus. Further, the retrovirus only infects dividing cells and therefore will also not result in 100% infection. In order to achieve a near 100% rate of infection, addition of virus can be repeated on multiple days, splitting the cells as needed. Alternatively, fluorescent positive cells can be isolated using fluorescence-activated cell-sorting. The most effective way to achieve a 100% infection rate with a lentiviruses is to perform a single infection followed by FACS isolation. For a retrovirus, perform 4-rounds of infection 24 hr apart and follow by FACS isolation to ensure 100% infection.\nAfter infecting the cells for 1 week, expand the cells to near confluence on a 10 cm plate, aspirate the media, and wash the plate with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Add 1 ml of 0.25% trypsin and incubate at 37 °C until the cells lift off the plate. Add 0.5 ml of Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium to neutralize the 0.25% trypsin reaction and pipette the cells into a 1.5 ml tube and pellet the cells at 500 x g for 5 min.",
    "To isolate DNA, add 100 µl of 50 mM potassium hydroxide, re-suspend the cells, and incubate at 95 °C for 5 min. Neutralize the solution using 10 µl of 1 M Tris, pH = 8.0.\nPCR amplify the region flanking the genomic region targeted by the CRISPR sgRNA using ~300 ng of the DNA isolated in step 5.5 using a high fidelity PCR master mix4.\nRun the PCR reaction on a 2.5% agarose gel and gel purify the appropriately sized fragment using a gel purification kit such as a gel DNA recovery kit. Ligate into a PCR cloning vector such as pGem-t-easy and transform into competent cells9.\n24 hr later, add 2 ml of LB broth into a 15 ml round-bottomed tubes as well as the appropriate antibiotic (ampicillin, neomycin, etc.). Inoculate the tube with an individual colony by using a sterile pipette tip or loop to select a single colony from the LB-plate. Expand and grow the colony by shaking the tube at 250 RPM and 37 °C for 24 hr. Repeat for as many colonies as desired.\n\t\nUsing a mini-prep kit, isolate DNA from the E. coli and sequence with primers designed to amplify the area of the gene targeted by the sgRNA in order to analyze the Cas9 targeted region of the mouse genome.\n6. Stereotaxic Injection Protocol for the Adult Mouse\nPrepare for Surgery\n\tNOTE: It is important to maintain sterile conditions during survival surgeries. This is accomplished in this protocol by heat sterilizing the surgery tools, using betadine to sterilize the injection site, and adding antibiotic ointment to the incision site after it is closed. It is also important to use sterile gloves as well as a thoroughly sterilized, dedicated surgery area.",
    "Heat sterilize surgery tools prior to use by either autoclaving or a using hot bead sterilizer. Prepare recovery chamber and surgery area by turning on heating pads to maintain body temperature during surgery and recovery. Assemble the drill used to create holes in the skull for injection.\nLoad 4 µl of virus into injection needle by withdrawing the virus directly from the sterile PCR tube. Briefly remove the viral aliquot from ice. Maintain the virus in the syringe at room temperature for no more than 1 hr prior to injection.\n7. Stereotaxic Injection\nConfirm that the ventilation to the surgery suite is open to ensure proper air flow. Prepare the mouse for surgery by anesthetizing with 4% isoflurane in an induction chamber. Following anesthesia, shave the head to prepare the injection site.\n\t\nPlace the mouse in the stereotaxic instrument by using tweezers to move tongue down and to the side. Insert the bite bar into mouth until teeth drop into the slot, then secure the ear bars. Ensure that the body of the mouse is on the heating pad and the nose is situated in the nose cone. Direct 4% isoflurane into the nose cone. Confirm anesthesia by pinching the foot with tweezers and ensuring that there is no startle reflex.\nApply artificial tears to lubricate the eyes. Finish preparing the injection site by swabbing the shaved head with alternating rounds of povidone-iodine and lidocaine.\nUsing a scalpel, cut small incision along center of scalp. Dry the skull with a swab and hydrogen peroxide if necessary to help visualize bregma.\n\t\nUsing a dissecting scope, locate bregma on the skull and place the drill tip on bregma. Zero (or record) the digital stereotactic coordinates on the x, y, and z planes.",
    "In order to ensure that the head is level on the rostral to caudal y-axis, place the drill bit on lambda and level the head so that the z-coordinate is roughly equal at both bregma and lambda.\nIn order to ensure that the head is level on the x-axis, place the drill bit to y = 1/2 lambda. Ensure that the z-coordinate is equal at 1 mm on each side (x = +/-1 mm) of the sagittal suture. Adjust the skull if there is a difference in the z-coordinate at 1mm to the left and right of lambda.\nPlace the drill over the desired coordinates. For the dentate gyrus, use the coordinates y = -1.9 from bregma and x = +/- 1.1. Before drilling, lower the isoflurane to 2%, then slowly and carefully, drill through the skull.\n\t\nAfter drilling all the holes, affix the filled-syringe onto the stereotaxic instrument. Visually center the syringe over the hole and zero the z coordinate at the skull.\nSlowly lower the syringe to deepest z-depth. For the dentate gyrus, the z depths are -2.5, -2.4, and -2.3. Begin injection at a rate of 0.25 µl/min using a stereotaxic injector.\n\t\t\nAfter the injection is complete at lowest Z-depth, wait 1 min, then raise to the next coordinate and begin injection again. Continue this pattern until all z-injection coordinates are injected. Wait 2 min before removing the syringe after the last injection.\n\t\t\tNOTE: No adverse effects have been noted on the tissue by injecting up to 2 µl of virus per hemisphere in the mouse brain.\nRepeat injection for other bore holes.\nAfter injection, remove the mouse from the stereotaxic instrument and suture the scalp with 6-0 silk sutures. Apply Lidocaine and an anti-bacterial cream to the wound.",
    "Inject 0.8-1.0 ml saline + Ketoprofen (3-5 mg/kg) via I.P. route to manage pain. Then place mouse into heated recovery chamber. Do not leave the animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Do not return the animal to the company of other animals until it has fully recovered.\nIn the days following the surgery, weigh the mouse daily and provide soft food and treats. Check wound and note the general condition/demeanor.\nFollowing stereotaxic injection, the mice can be euthanized for slice prep electrophysiology1 or perfused and their brains removed, sliced, and stained via immunohistochemistry for analysis10."
