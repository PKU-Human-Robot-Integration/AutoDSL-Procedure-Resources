  "procedures": [
    "In this protocol, we collect samples of whole blood from a cohort of patients with prostate cancer. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are isolated from this whole blood via differential centrifugation, and DCs are subsequently isolated from that population using a magnetic bead isolation kit.\nMaterials\nCAS 9005-64-5 (P1379) Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE17-1440-03; Sigma-Aldrich)\nBlood Dendritic Cell Isolation Kit II, human (130-091-379; Miltenyi Biotec)\nHBSS (Gibco)\nRPMI medium: RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen)/10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) with penicillin/streptomycin\nVacutainer blood collection tubes (366643; BD)\n15-ml conical tubes\nSerological pipettor\nSerological pipets\nCentrifuge: e.g., Thermo Sorvall ST16\nPipettor\nPipet tips\n1. Draw ∼8 ml of whole blood per patient into BD Vacutainer collection tubes containing 3.2% sodium citrate (BD 366643).\n2. Isolate PBMCs via gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque. Pipet 4 ml Ficoll-Paque into each of two separate 15-ml conical tubes.\nGently pipet against the side wall of the tube, being careful not to directly mix the two liquids.\nCentrifuge 20 min at 2000 × g (at 6 acceleration and 2 deceleration in Thermo Sorvall ST16 centrifuge), room temperature.\nCarefully pipet the buffy coat (cloudy layer) out of the tube and into a new tube.\nAdd HBSS to the buffy coat and centrifuge 5 min at 300 × g, room temperature, with standard acceleration and deceleration.\nRemove the supernatant and proceed to step 3 with the cell pellet.\n3. Separate the DCs from the PBMCs isolated in the previous step using the manufacturer's directions for magnetic bead isolation (Miltenyi Biotec's Blood Dendritic Cell Isolation Kit II).\n         \nCount cells and resuspend the pellet based on the desired concentration of cells.\nPerform first isolation, negatively selecting for non-DC populations.\nCount cells after this step.\nPerform second isolation, positively selecting for DCs.\nCount cells after this step.\nResuspend DCs in RPMI medium at 1 × 105 cells/ml.",
    "Cells are immediately processed.",
    "In this protocol, we stimulate previously isolated human DCs with fluid shear stress (FSS). The protocol includes appropriate controls to account for any activation that could potentially be a result of the instrument setup as opposed to the applied FSS. This protocol is straightforward, with no anticipated difficulties.\nMaterials\n70% (v/v) ethanol\n5.0% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich)\nDC suspension in RPMI (Basic Protocol 1, step 3d)\nRPMI medium: RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) and penicillin/streptomycin\nCone-and-Plate Viscometers (Brookfield)\nCone spindles (CPA-41Z; Brookfield)\n15-ml conical tubes\nSerological pipettor\nSerological pipets\nPipettor\nPipet tips\n12-well plates (optional)\nActivation of DCs using shear stress\n1. Clean cone-and-plate flow devices and spindles using 70% ethanol. Use two cone-and-plate devices per patient (one will be turned on for stimulation and one will remain stationary for an unstimulated control condition).\n2. Calibrate the cone-and-plate flow device according to the manufacturer's directions using CPA-41Z cone spindles.\nBrookfield cone (part no. CPA-41Z) spindles are used in combination with the flow devices to accommodate a total of 2 ml of each sample.\n3. Block all cone-and-plate flow devices with 2 ml of 5.0% BSA for 1 hr in order to prevent nonspecific binding.\n4. Pipet 2 ml of DC suspension in RPMI into the plate of each corresponding cone-and-plate flow device. Secure the cone and plate.\n5. Stimulate cells with 5 dyn/cm2 FSS by turning on the flow device at 100 rpm.\nUnstimulated cells will remain in the flow device for the entirety of the stimulation, assumed to be at 0 dyn/cm2 FSS, as the machine will be left turned off. This group allows controls to experience the same experimental environment as the stimulated group.\nCalculation of fluid shear stress: Once the shear rate is set, the shear stress determined by formula:",
    "$\\tau = \\mu G,$\n where τ is the FSS and μ is the viscosity (cP). Note that μ is approximated as 2.5 cP for the cell suspensions.\nThe protocol for applying FSS to cells has been previously described (Hope et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.933#cpz1933-bib-0014]; Hope et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.933#cpz1933-bib-0015]; Mitchell & King, 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.933#cpz1933-bib-0021]; Wayne et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.933#cpz1933-bib-0037]). It is important to note that the cells in the flow device receive the same shear rate at all locations within the fluid, the fluid is assumed to be Newtonian, and flow is assumed to be laminar. As such, the equation used to determine the local shear rate is G = ω/tan(θ), where G is shear rate, ω is angular velocity (rad/s), and θ is the cone angle (rad).\nPreviously, when using this protocol, we have been able to activate immune cells such as T cells and dendritic cells. (Hope et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.933#cpz1933-bib-0014]; Dombrowski et al., 2023[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.933#cpz1933-bib-0050])\n6. Cells may now be immediately processed by transferring them using a pipet to correspondingly labeled 1.5-µl microcentrifuge tubes (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.933#cpz1933-prot-0003] for following steps). For experiments being performed after 4 or more hours, cells should be plated into a 12-well plate and incubated at 37°C (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.933#cpz1933-prot-0003] for following steps).\n7. For representative data to confirm the correct execution of these procedures, see the final step of Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.933#cpz1933-prot-0003], below.",
    "In this protocol, DCs stimulated immediately after being collected from the cone-and-plate flow device, or after being lifted and washed following an overnight incubation, are analyzed (along with unstimulated control DCs) via flow cytometry. This procedure is used to assess their expression of costimultory molecules required for effective DC priming of T cells for attack of cancer cells. This protocol is performed following Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.933#cpz1933-prot-0002], step 7. For cells plated for 24 h, first follow steps 1a-c to lift the cells. To immediately begin working with the cells, proceed to step 2a or 2b.\nMaterials\nFSS-simulated cells (from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.933#cpz1933-prot-0002]) in 1.5-µl microcentrifuge tubes (from any preferred plastics supplier; preferably easy-open tubes to facilitate working with many tubes at a time)\nRPMI medium: RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen) with fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) and penicillin/streptomycin\n0.25% trypsin (Gibco)\nHank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) without calcium and magnesium (Gibco)\n32% paraformaldehyde aqueous solution (PFA; Electron Microscopy Sciences)\n100% methanol, 4°C\nBovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich)\nPE-phospho-NF-κB p65 (Ser529; Thermo Fisher) or PE-phospho-c-Fos (AP-1; Ser32; cFosS32-BA9; Thermo Fisher)\nAnti-human PE-CD40 (5C3; Biolegend), anti-human PE-CD80 (305207; Biolegend), or PE-anti-CD86 human monoclonal (305438; BioLegend)\nAppropriate sample tubes\n96-well U-bottom plate\nFlow cytometer\n1. Prepare the FSS-simulated cells for staining by one of two methods: if you are evaluating an intracellular target, proceed to step 2a; if evaluating an extracellular target, proceed to step 2b. This step is performed either immediately after FSS application or after 24 hr. In the latter case, to analyze cell response after 24 hr, perform the following actions before proceeding to step 2a or 2b.",
    "Pipet cell suspensions into correspondingly labeled tubes, add 200 µl of 0.25% trypsin per tube to lift the cells, and let sit for 5 min. Neutralize the reaction with 200 µl RPMI and then pipet the cells into labeled tubes.\nCentrifuge the cells for 5 min at 300 × g, room temperature.\nWash cells in 1 ml HBSS and centrifuge for 5 min at 300 × g, room temperature.\n2a. For intracellular staining of proteins such as phospho-NF-κB and phospho-c-Fos, use the following protocol:\n         \nFix cells for 10 min with 4% PFA in HBSS.\nCentrifuge 5 min at 300 × g, room temperature.\nWash cells with 1 ml HBSS.\nCentrifuge 5 min at 300 × g, room temperature.\nPermeabilize cells with 1 ml of 100% methanol (4°C).\nWash cells with 1 ml HBSS.\nPrepare the following antibody cocktail (per sample): 3:100 phospho-NF-κB or 2:100 phospho-c-Fos in 100 µl of 1% BSA. Add to the cells and allow cells to stain for 15 min in the absence of light.\nWash cells with 1 ml HBSS.\nResuspend pellet in 250 µl HBSS. Pipet into a 96-well U-bottom plate for flow cytometry analysis.\n2b. For extracellular staining (after 24 hr) of proteins such as CD40, CD80, or CD86, use the following:\n         \nWash cells with 1 ml HBSS.\nPrepare the following antibody cocktail: 1:100 CD40, CD80, or CD86 in 100 µl of 1% BSA. Add to cells and allow cells to stain for 15 min in the absence of light.\nWash cells with 1 ml HBSS.\nResuspend pellet in 250 µl HBSS. Pipet into a 96-well U-bottom plate for flow cytometry analysis.",
    "3. Load 96-well plate with 250 µl cell suspensions into the flow cytometer, detecting at 575-nm wavelength corresponding to each of the PE-conjugated antibodies. Collect cells at 10,000 events and gate for DCs.\n4. After loading cells into the flow cytometer, gate in forward scatter and side scatter, and then gate for specific populations such as NF-κB or specific DC populations of interest. An example of results obtained using this gating strategy for a typical data set derived from healthy donors can be seen in Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.933#cpz1933-fig-0001].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e424e6dd-8c59-490a-abed-0e57117a9520/cpz1933-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nGating example.
