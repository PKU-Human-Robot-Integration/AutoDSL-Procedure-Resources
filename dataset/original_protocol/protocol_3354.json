    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nMicroinjection of Zebrafish Embryos\nTiming: 2 days\nDay 1: Separate female and male zebrafish in 1 L breeding tanks (Tecniplast), using a separating barrier, in a ratio of 3:2 (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). Use at least 2 breeding tanks for each injection condition. We recommend separating the fish in the afternoon.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/312-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Example of a 1-L Breeding Tank Containing a Separating Barrier between Three Female and Two Male Adult Zebrafish\nDay 2: Prepare the mixture of Cas9 mRNA (150 ng/μL, final concentration) and sgRNAs (80 ng/μL, final concentration). For each μL of mixture add 0.2 μL of Phenol Red 0.5% (Sigma-Aldrich #P0290). Always keep tubes on ice.\nNote: You can fine-tune the final concentration for each sgRNA.\nNote: Phenol Red is used to color the mix solution, allowing to distinguish injected and non-injected eggs.\nRemove the separating barriers, within the first 2 h after the lights of the fish facility are turned on, let the fish cross and monitor when they start to lay eggs. Then, collect fertilized eggs by using a strainer, within 20 min.\nInject 1–2 nL of the prepared mixtures of Cas9 and sgRNAs into one-cell stage embryos, using a microinjector (Narishige IM-300) and a stereomicroscope (Leica KL300). Ideally, Cas9+sgRNAs mix should be injected in the cell; however, we recommend to keep all injected embryos (injected in the cell, in the yolk, or in their interface).\nNote: After crossing each fish tank and performing the injection, go back to the fish facility, collect the remaining embryos and carry on with the injection.\nNote: 1 μL of mixture should be enough to inject 200 embryos. We recommend to inject 200–400 embryos per condition. If in a single day is not possible to reach this range, we recommend to repeat the injections.",
    "Note: For each injected condition, grow non-injected embryos as control to determine the viability of embryo batches. You can also add a negative control for the experiment by injecting only Cas9, to test potential toxicity arising from the Cas9 microinjection.\nGrow the embryos for 24 h in E3 medium (see Materials and Equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) in an incubator at 28°C.\nDNA Extraction and PCR Amplification\nTiming: 5–7 h\nCollect 3 batches of 8 embryos with 24 hpf using Pasteur pipette and transfer to 1.5 mL or 0.2 mL tubes.\nNote: Before proceeding with the protocol, inspect the health of the injected embryos and remove dead and abnormally developing embryos. Also, compare the lethality of injected embryos with the non-injected controls.\nPerform DNA Extraction as described below (DNA extraction from zebrafish embryos (24 hpf)):\nNote: Alternative methods for DNA extraction can also be used (e.g., hot-shot NaOH-based method)\nStart by anesthetizing embryos using a tricaine methanesulfonate solution (Sigma-Aldrich #E10521; final concentration of 160 μg/mL).\nAdd 70 μL of Chelex 100 resin (Sigma-Aldrich #95577).\nCritical: Homogenize the Chelex solution before use by swirling it. Cut the micropipette tip in order to pipette the chelex beads.\nAdd 5 μL of proteinase K (NzyTech #MB019) (from 10 mg/mL stock).\nIncubate for 3 h at 56°C (in a thermomixer or thermocycler).\nIncubate 10 min at 100°C to inactivate proteinase K.\nTransfer the liquid upper phase containing the DNA to a new tube and store at −20°C. Do not take the chelex beads.\nNote: There is no need to remove the embryos from the chorion to perform the DNA extraction.\nPause Point: You can keep extracted DNA at −20 °C for several months.\nUse the resulting DNA as template for PCR amplification, with primers flanking the region targeted by the sgRNAs (see Genotyping PCR design[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.5]; Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).",
    "Mix the following reagents for genotyping PCR;\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_312_11.csv\nRun the genotyping PCR using the amplification protocol:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_312_12.csv\n∗ Annealing temperature should be optimized for each pair of primers, based on specific Tm; typically, it should be Tm-5°C.\nRun 5 μL of the PCR product plus 1 μL of Loading Dye in a 1%–2% agarose gel. In the presence of a deletion, the PCR product will contain molecules of lower size than in controls (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nCritical: If lower size bands are not visible in the gel, this might be due to the lack of activity of one or more sgRNAs. In this case, you should test individual sgRNAs for functionality by performing the heteroduplex mobility assay (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nGrow the remaining injected fish to adulthood (F0 – parental strains) to be screened for germline transmission (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/312-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Pipeline from Microinjection to Establishing a Zebrafish Mutant Line\nNote: The detection of the deletion in the PCR means that it is present in a mosaic fashion in at least 1 of 8 embryos.\nEstablishing a Stable Mutant Line\nTiming: 5–7 months",
    "Mutagenesis is induced in zebrafish individuals, having a likelihood of affecting somatic and germline cells in a mosaic way. These initial individuals are termed Founders (F0). F0s might harbor different somatic and germline cells with different mutations, since different cells will go through independent mutagenesis events. To isolate mutations, F0s are crossed with wild type adults and the progeny is termed F1. F1 fish need to be genotyped, sequenced, and treated independently, since the recovered mutations might differ at the sequence level. In the case of CRISPR-Cas9, the system generates double-strand breaks (DSBs) at the designed targeted cleavage sites, being repaired by non-homologous end-joining pathway (NHEJ) (Cong et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). NHEJ is an error-prone system that may result in deletion or insertion of few base pairs, a phenomenon known as “indels” formation, conferring a certain degree of randomness for each independent mutagenesis event. When using a pair of sgRNA for targeted deletion of a genomic sequence, as in the current protocol, indels can occur at both sgRNA cleavage sites. For this reason, when establishing a stable mutant line, it is essential to sequence the genotyping PCR bands to determine the exact sequence of the deletion of each F1 fish.\nTest germline transmission by crossing F0 adults with WT animals and perform PCR amplification (as described before), in DNA extracted from 3 batches of 8 embryos.\nNote: From a tank carrying 25 adult fish, we estimate that 3 are able to transmit the deletion to the progeny (approximately 10%).\nSelect F0 adults that are able to transmit the deletion to the progeny. Cross with WT animals and grow F1 (offspring of F0 generation).\nGenotype F1 adult fish, by performing fin clipping, followed by DNA extraction and genotyping PCR (as described in the previous session). For Fin Clipping:",
    "Anesthetize fish using a tricaine methanesulfonate solution (Sigma-Aldrich #E10521). Dissolve in, at least, 100 mL of water from the zebrafish housing system, in a final concentration of 160 μg/mL.\nMove anesthetized fish to a 10 cm dish, without water.\nCut a small portion of the fish tail (without reaching the tail bifurcation) with a sterile blade and put it in a clean 1.5 mL tube, on ice.\nTransfer the fish to water and let it recover from anesthesia.\nKeep fish separated from others and monitor its health over a period of 1 week.\nUse the collected fish tail to perform the genomic DNA extraction protocol.\nCut the deletion band of each positive sample from the agarose gel and extract them individually, using a gel extraction Kit (NZY GelPure; NzyTech #MB011). Sequence the PCR products by Sanger sequencing (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/312-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

    "The rational of this assay consists in identifying, from the same PCR reaction, amplicons that differ in few base pairs (Zhu et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). After a brief denaturation of DNA strands by heat, followed by slowly re-annealing, PCR products containing distinct amplicons will form mismatched heteroduplexes as well as perfectly matched homoduplexes of DNA. The WT genomic DNA will contain only WT alleles, thus forming homoduplex DNA. In the case of DNA from batches of embryos injected with a functional sgRNA, the PCR will amplify a mixture of “indel” (genomic insertions or deletions) mutations and WT alleles, generating both heteroduplexes and homoduplexes of DNA in the HMA assay. Usually, heteroduplexes of DNA migrate slower than homoduplex, allowing the visualization in a polyacrylamide (PAGE) gel (example shown in Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/312-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Representation of a PAGE Gel for Testing a Single sgRNA\nGenomic DNA from a batch of 8 WT embryos will only contain WT alleles, forming homoduplex DNA (lane 2). DNA from 3 batches of 8 injected embryos, a mixture of “indel” mutations and WT alleles will be present, leading to the formation of heteroduplex DNA, indicating that the injected sgRNA is actively targeting the zebrafish genome. If more than one band is seen on the WT lane, this might be due to the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the targeted genomic sequence. You should only extract and sequence heteroduplex bands that differ from those seen in the WT case.\nDay 1: Separate WT fish in 1 L breeding tanks, as described before.\nDay 2: Cross the fish and collect one-cell stage embryos.\nInject one-cell-stage embryos with a mixture of Cas9 (150–200 ng/μL final concentration) and single sgRNAs (50–150 ng/μL final concentration).",
    "Collect 3 batches of 8 injected embryos and 1 batch of 8 non-injected embryos, as control for WT genomic DNA.\nPerform DNA extraction using batches of embryos as samples (as described above).\nPause Point: Extracted DNA can be kept at −20 °C for several months.\nPerform a PCR amplification using primers flanking the targeted regions (as described above for the genotyping PCR). You can use the primers designed in step 24 of Before You Begin or design new ones.\nNote: The PCR product of this reaction will be sequenced. For this reason, you can opt to use a proofreading polymerase, such as iMaxII DNA Polymerase (Boca Scientific #25261). Be aware of the specific guidelines of different DNA polymerases, for performing the reaction.\nNote: The size of the PCR product will influence the percentage of polyacrylamide to be used in the PAGE gel. We recommend short PCR products (150–500 bp). For a 200 bp PCR product, a 15% PAGE Gel is adequate.\nHeat PCR products at 95°C for 5 min and perform re-annealing by slowly cooling down at 22°C–25°C, for another 5 min.\nRun 3 μL the PCR product plus 0.6 μL of Loading Dye on a 2% agarose gel to confirm amplification.\nPause Point: PCR products can be kept at 4°C for several weeks.\nDay 3: Load 2–10 μL of the PCR product plus 0.4–2 μL of Loading Dye (depending on the intensity of the band observed in the agarose gel) into a PAGE gel. For PAGE gel preparation (12 mL, 15%), mix the reagents as shown in the table below:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_312_13.csv\nNote: The last reagents to be added should be TEMED and APS (as they catalyze polymerization). Then, quickly assemble the gel caster.\nRun Gel in TBE running buffer (1×,) for 3 h, at 150 V.",
    "Carefully disassemble the PAGE chamber and transfer the gel to a tray with 50 mL TBE 1×, supplemented with 2 μL Green Safe (NzyTech # MB13201). Incubate by swirling for 10 min to dye the gel for following DNA visualization.\nNote: As Green Safe is light sensitive, protect the tray from light during incubations.\nRemove the TBE and wash the gel in distilled water (2 times, 5 min each).\nVisualize DNA under UV light, in a transilluminator. Cut the WT band (smaller – see Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]) and heteroduplex bands (bigger) and dissolve the extracted bands in Tris-EDTA or Tris 10 mM (use enough volume to cover the gel fragments). Incubate for 12–18 h at 37°C, shaking in a thermomixer (500 rpm).\nPerform a PCR amplification with the extracted products as template (same protocol and primers as described in step 8 of Step-by-Step Method Details).\nSequence the amplicons by Sanger sequencing. If the tested sgRNA efficiently targets genomic DNA in vivo, overlapping signals will be observed in the sequencing chromatogram after the PAM sequence, due to a mixture of multiple PCR fragments.\nNote: Sequencing the PCR products from all heteroduplex bands and comparing to the WT homoduplex band will confirm the targeting of the tested sgRNA."
