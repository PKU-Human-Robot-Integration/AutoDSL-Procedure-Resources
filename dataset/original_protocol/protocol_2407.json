    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDIG-label DNA and label efficiency detection\nTiming: 4 h\nThis step describes how to label DNA probe with DIG and perform the label efficiency detection. During this step, the DIG-ddUTP solution and Terminal Transferase were utilized for labeling the 3′ end of DNA. Oligonucleotides, including either RNA and single- or double-stranded DNA can be labeled with high efficiency (Green and Sambrook, 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Hocquellet et al., 1997[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). Depending on the probe labeling efficiency, this step can be repeated as needed and probes can be pooled together for further utilization. The DIG-labeled probe with a high detection efficiency is paramount to obtaining optimal and reproducible results.\nDIG-labeling of the target DNA fragment.\nAliquot 200 ng of the ler promoter DNA fragments in a 0.2 mL PCR tube and add PCR-grade water to the reaction to a total volume of 10 μL.\nPrepare the following reaction buffer (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]) on ice and gently mix the buffer with a pipette.\nAdd 10 μL of the above reaction buffer to step (a) tube with target DNA fragment, mix gently by pipetting.\nIncubate the reaction tube in a PCR machine as indicated in the below program (Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]). Set the lid temperature at 95°C.\nNote: The temperature and incubation time is critical for the reaction. To ensure accuracy, pre-set the PCR machine to 37°C before starting the DIG label reaction program.\nOptional: After the DIG label reaction is complete, it is optimal to set the denaturation step to 95°C for 5 min, followed by slow cooling at 25°C for DNA annealing. This step can ensure the thorough dissociation of the left Terminal Transferase with the DIG-labeled DNA inside the reaction, thus eliminating the non-specific binding band of Terminal Transferase in the following step (Tokunaga and Stegeman, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]).",
    "Add 2 μL 0.2 M EDTA (pH 8.0) to above reaction tube to stop the labeling reaction.\nAdd 3 μL of PCR-graded water to the reaction to a total volume of 25 μL. The final concentration for DIG-labeled DNA is 8 ng/μL.\nRepeat the DNA labeling reaction and process as described in steps a-f for the negative control gene rpoS.\nNote: Different negative control genes can be selected according to the type of target protein. Herein, the conserved housekeeping gene rpoS coding for a subunit of RNA polymerase was selected (Dong and Schellhorn, 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nLabel efficiency detection for DIG-labeled DNA.\nMake ten-fold serial dilutions of the above-labeled DNA using PCR-graded water in 0.2 mL PCR tubes.\nMark the tubes with DNA concentrations from high to low as No. 1–4.\nMark the control tube without DNA probe as No. 5 according to Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5].\nCut a small piece of nylon membrane (1 cm × 5 cm) and orderly spot 1 μL of samples from tubes No. 1–5 onto the membrane.\nPut the nylon membrane into a 120°C oven for 15 min with an Extra Thick Blot Paper at the bottom to perform the crosslinking step, during which step the nucleic acid can be fixed to the membrane.\nNote: Nylon membrane is a positively charged membrane with a pore diameter of 0.45 μm, which is widely applicable in Southern, Northern, and spotting blot. A strong detection but low background signal can be achieved through color or chemiluminescence detection in DIG-labeled probe hybridization process. Therefore, the nylon membrane is pivotal in signal capture for obtaining optimal results during the protocol processing.",
    "Note: It is better to prepare and spot probes with serial dilutions of DNA with concentrations ranging from high to low, and cut a triangle mark at the upward right side of the nylon membrane to mark the side of the membrane. Make sure the membrane with probes is always right-side up and take care not to invert or rotate the membrane.\nNote: Turn on the oven to 120°C in advance; be equipped with proper gloves to prevent accidental injury during the experimental procedure.\nOptimal: UV crosslinking can also be performed for nucleic acid fixing to the membrane with a following-up air-dry step for approximately 30 min.\nPause point: It is possible to pause at this point, and the baked membrane can be stored at 4°C for 1 week between two pieces of Blot paper (3 mm).\nWash the membrane.\nTake the membrane out from the oven carefully and put it in an appropriate plastic container (2 cm × 8 cm).\nSoak the membrane properly in 10 mL Washing buffer and incubate it at 25°C with horizontal shaking for 2 min at 60 rpm.\nBlock the membrane.\nPour out the Washing buffer carefully, take care not to disturb the membrane inside.\nAdd 10 mL 1× Blocking buffer and incubate it at 25°C with horizontal shaking for 30 min at 60 rpm.\nOptimal: As an alternative, several other commercial Blocking solutions are also available. Alternatively, a manually prepared Blocking buffer containing 1× Maleic acid buffer with 100 μg/mL herring sperm DNA and 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) can also be used.\nEquilibrate the membrane with Anti-DIG antibody.\nPour out the Blocking buffer, take care not to disturb the membrane inside.",
    "Add 10 mL Anti-DIG antibody solution (Dilute Anti-DIG-AP antibody 1:10,000 in 1× Blocking buffer) and incubate it at 25°C with horizontal shaking for 30 min at 60 rpm.\nPour out the Anti-DIG antibody solution, take care not to disturb the membrane inside. Add 10 mL Washing buffer and incubate it at 25°C with horizontal shaking for 15 min at 60 rpm.\nRepeat the above washing step (g) once.\nEquilibrate the membrane with Detection buffer.\nPour out the Washing buffer, take care not to disturb the membrane inside.\nAdd 10 mL Detection buffer and equilibrate the membrane at 25°C with horizontal shaking for 2–5 min at 60 rpm.\nIncubate the right-side membrane with DNA probe with 0.5 mL CSPD for 5 min at 25°C. Take caution that the membrane should not be exposed to light during this step.\nChemiluminescent exposure of the membrane in Amersham Imager 600 with elongated times from 10 s till 5 min for both the ler promoter and rpoS probes.\nOptional: The tray of Amersham Imager 600 is optional to cover with a proper sized plastic wrap for membrane incubation with CSPD, which can save the amount of CSPD and hence maximize its work efficiency before performing immunochemistry exposure.\nSave each scanning image and compare the labeling efficiency of target and control DNA probes.\nNote: Make sure the nylon membrane with probes is maintained right-side up during washing, equilibrating, and detection.\nNote: The labeled DNA probes can be stored at 4°C for short time (within 1 month). The probes can be stored at −20°C long-term.",
    "Critical: Probe labeling success is achieved if clear signals can be detected for the 0.008 ng DIG-labeled DNA dot within 5 min of exposure. The labeled probe with the lowest detection signal in 0.08 ng DNA dot can also be utilized albeit with lower efficiency, but higher amounts of probes should be used in the following steps. However, other situations indicated the labeling DNA was not sufficient, and it was necessary to check the experimental steps and re-conduct the DIG labeling process (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nPause point: It is possible to pause at this point.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2044_14.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2044_15.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2044_16.csv\nCoincubation and reaction of the DNA and target protein mixture\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step describes how to perform the DNA and target protein mixture reaction. If the detected protein has binding affinity to the tested nucleic acid, protein-nucleic acid complexes are expected to occur after coincubation under appropriate time and conditions. The larger of the molecular weight of the complex, the slower the migration on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis compared with the probes without bounded protein. Based on this theory, a retarded phenomenon on the gel displaying a “shifted” band at the front of the membrane in comparison to the mobility of the free probe indicates that there is a binding interaction activity between the target protein and the DNA probe (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) (Holden and Tacon, 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2044-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. A figure illustrated the schematic diagram of the EMSA method\nTarget protein and DIG-labeled DNA probe are co-incubated under appropriate conditions for protein-DNA reaction (left panel). The reaction mixtures without (1) or with (2) target proteins are loaded into a native PAGE gel, and immunoblotted to detect protein-DNA interactions (middle and right panel). A retarded gel shifting band is expected if the target protein has binding activity to the tested DNA probe.",
    "Prepare the reaction mixture for AirA protein and ler promoter or rpoS DNA fragment.\nPrepare the AirA protein and ler promoter DNA fragment mixture reactions in 0.2 mL tubes on ice as indicated in Table 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6].\nMix well gently with a pipette and quickly spin down the reagents in each tube.\nRepeat the steps a-b for the rpoS DNA fragment.\nNote: The concentration of the AirA protein should be no less than 100 nM. Low protein concentration can result in a lower detection signal after immunoblotting, and simply increasing the amounts of protein may cause samples to spill from the PAGE gel wells.\nCritical: The ingredient of the Binding buffer in this part is not fixed, since different target proteins may require different components for proper binding reactions, which need to be determined or validated by certain other experiments. Cofactors, such as magnesium ions, iron ions, calcium ions and biotin, are often components needed for the binding reactions (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nCritical: pH is another critical part of the Binding buffer, and care should be taken to match the conductivity of the samples and electrophoresis buffer (Altschuler et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Hellman and Fried, 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). Here, pH 7.6 was used for detecting AirA. However, the pH of Binding buffer should be adjusted and optimized accordingly according to the properties of the target proteins (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nPerform the reaction program in a PCR machine set with the below program (Table 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl7]).",
    "Note: Here, the incubation program is set at 30°C for 20 min for protein-DNA reaction. However, the reaction program can be variable based on the chemical properties of different proteins. A wide range of binding temperatures have been described (Hellman and Fried, 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). For example, the optimal reaction temperature for the catabolite activator protein (CAP) from E. coli is typically 37°C (Garner and Revzin, 1981[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]), while the reaction temperature for the CtrA protein from Ehrlichia chaffeensis cells is low (e.g., 2°C–25°C) (Cheng et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Therefore, the reaction temperature and time need to be adjusted and optimized based on the characteristics of target proteins accordingly (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nTake out the tubes and put them on ice immediately after the reaction program was finished.\nAdd 5 μL of 5× Loading buffer to each reaction tube, mix well by pipetting and briefly spin down the tubes.\nNote: Any denaturing agent contamination in the Loading buffer should be avoided, otherwise the protein-DNA complex may be disturbed and result in uncertain experimental conclusions.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2044_17.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2044_18.csv\nSet the lid temperature at 95°C.\nNative-PAGE gel electrophoresis\nTiming: 1.5 h\nThis step describes the native-PAGE gel electrophoresis process.\nNative-PAGE gel electrophoresis.\nNote: Normally the acrylamide concentration within 6%–8% for PAGE gel is appropriate for the majority of experimental procedures. The acrylamide concentration can be optimized accordingly if the detected protein-DNA complex size is special.\nPre-run the 6% native PAGE gel with 0.5× TBE running buffer at 80 V for 30 min using a constant voltage power supply.",
    "Note: 0.5× TBE buffer is normally utilized for native PAGE gel electrophoresis. However, for some proteins like GSK-3β (Chen et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]), the ion concentrations in 0.5× TBE buffer is too high to maintain the stability of formed protein-DNA complexes. In such cases, lower ion concentration (e.g., 0.25× TBE) is needed to meet the requirement of specific proteins.\nCritical: It is conventional (and desirable) to conduct the pre-running step for polyacrylamide gels to clear the ions that would increase conductivity, which will hence, generate too much heat for the gel during running.\nOptional: To make the sample well easier for visualization, 2 μL 5× Loading buffer can be pre-loaded in each well before loading samples.\nLoad 20 μL of reaction samples in each well in order according to the protein concentration from low to high (i.e., from left to right is 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 75 nM) with a pipette.\nRun the native PAGE gel in above pre-run buffer at 120 V for 60 min using a constant voltage power supply at 4°C cold room or on ice.\nNote: The gel running process can be normally performed at 25°C. However, to maximize the stability of the protein-DNA complex, it is better to be performed at a low temperature (i.e., 4°C).\nNote: The gel running time can be variable according to the experimental DNA size, and the bromophenol blue inside the Loading buffer can be used as an indicator of gel running time (i.e., until the dye reaches the bottom of the gel) (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nMembrane transfer and crosslinking\nTiming: 2 h",
    "This step describes the membrane transfer and crosslinking process. Herein, the wet transfer method with a “sandwich” structure was selected for membrane transfer. Based on our experience, high protein and nucleotide transfer efficiency can be achieved using wet transfer method, since both the PAGE gel with DNA and protein, and the membrane can be thoroughly soaked with the transfer buffer during the process. However, for the semi-dry transfer method, the transfer occurred between the two electrode plates, and a high operational experience was required. Therefore, the membrane transfer efficiency of proteins and DNA, and their retention on the membrane are often difficult to control during semi-dry transfer, leading to a fluctuant result and difficulty for experimental results interpretation. As a result, the wet transfer method is recommended and utilized here.\nMembrane transfer.\nPry open the glass plate carefully and remove these excess gels from the sample wells after the PAGE gel electrophoresis.\nNote: Make sure the target protein did not run off the gel during the procedure.\nAssemble a “sandwich” structure for the wet transfer procedure.\nPre-wet the nylon membrane with proper size (i.e., same as the glass plate) into transfer buffer for 5 min.\nPut two pieces of filter paper (Blot paper, 3 mm) and sponges into a proper plastic box containing enough transfer buffers.\nAssemble the membrane transfer clip as below order: negative charged transfer clip side > sponge > filter paper > PAGE gel > nylon membrane > filter paper > sponge > positive charged transfer clip side.\nPut the membrane transfer clip inside the membrane transfer tank with the orientation that the gel surface is connected to the negative electrode, and the nylon membrane side is connected to the positive electrode (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).",
    "Note: Air bubbles can cause incomplete transfer. Avoid bubbles generation during the “sandwich” assembly operation process, a glass rod is often used to dislodge the bubbles.\nNote: Make sure the operator is wearing gloves, and try not to touch the membrane since either protein or oil on one’s hands can affect the membrane transfer efficiency and contaminate the membrane.\nPerform the membrane transfer at 4°C cold room with an ice bag on one side of the transfer tank, setting the transfer program at 80 V, 200 mA for 60 min.\nNote: Prevention of too much heat generation during the membrane transfer process. The transfer program is optional according to experimental times, and a program with 200 mA–400 mA at 30–60 min is normally selected. The membrane transfer time depends on the DNA fragment size; the longer the DNA lengths, the longer transfer duration is often needed (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nPut the transferred membrane on the center of a Thick Blot Paper with proper size (14 × 16 cm) flatly.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2044-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. A representative figure displaying the wet-transfer procedure\nTransfer the whole paper with membrane into a 120°C oven, baking for 15 min to fix the nucleic acid on the membrane.\nNote: Take care about the direction of the transferred membrane, the side in contact with the PAGE gel contains the exposed DNA. The direction of the membrane would directly affect the signal strength after immunochemistry exposure, since the right-side of the membrane with exposed DNA is conducive to the reaction of DIG-labeled fragments with antibodies.\nPause point: It is possible to pause at this point. The transferred membrane can be carefully stored at 4°C for 1 week between two sheets of Blot paper (3 mm).\nImmunoblotting and chemiluminescent detection\nTiming: 2.5 h",
    "This step describes how to perform immunoblotting and chemiluminescent detection.\nImmunoblotting.\nPut the membrane into a suitable sized plastic container (10 cm × 15 cm), add 30 mL of Washing buffer and soak the membrane thoroughly, incubating at 25°C with horizontal shaking for 2 min at 60 rpm.\nPour out the Washing buffer carefully, take care not to disturb the membrane inside. Add 50 mL 1× Blocking buffer and incubate it at 25°C with horizontal shaking for 30 min at 60 rpm (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9] and 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.6]).\nPour out the Blocking buffer carefully, take care not to disturb the membrane inside. Add 20 mL Anti-DIG antibody solution (Dilute Anti-DIG-AP antibody 1:10,000 in 1× Blocking buffer) and incubate it at 25°C with horizontal shaking for 30 min at 60 rpm (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9] and 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11]).\nPour out the Anti-DIG antibody solution carefully, take care not to disturb the membrane inside. Add 50 mL Washing buffer and incubate it at 25°C with horizontal shaking for 15 min at 60 rpm.\nRepeat the above washing step (d) once.\nEquilibrate the membrane in 30 mL detection buffer at 25°C with horizontal shaking for 2–5 min at 60 rpm.\nChemiluminescent detection.\nCover the tray of Amersham Imager 600 with a proper sized plastic wrap. Put the right-side of the membrane onto the tray and incubate it with 1 mL CSPD for 5 min at 25°C.\nNote: Take caution that this process should be protected from light and the membrane should be maintained damp.\nPerform chemiluminescent detection by auto-exposure using Amersham Imager 600. Further adjust the exposure program manually according to the autoexposure time till to 5 min (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).\nNote: Pay attention to the direction of the membrane. The right-side membrane with DIG-DNA fragment should be always upward during the immunoblotting and chemiluminescent detection process.",
    "Note: If the signal is too weak, it can be resolved by extending the CSPD incubation time or chemiluminescent exposure time to 10 min.\nCritical: With the protein amount increasing, a gradually increased detection signal for DNA and protein binding would be detected (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). According to the results, we can see that when 60 nM (i.e., 8 μL) of the target protein is added, DNA and protein are completely combined to form a protein-DNA complex. Therefore, this protein concentration will be selected for further competitive gel electrophoresis migration experiment, which is carried out to address the specificity of the protein-DNA binding in the settled experimental conditions.\nOptimal: The detected binding signal of target protein to DNA may be due to non-specific binding. Therefore, to rule out this possibility, poly [d(I-C)] or poly [d(A-T)] are often used as non-specific competitors for EMSA (Buratowski and Chodosh, 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Ferraz et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). Herein, we also performed the exact same procedure as steps 3–9 above, except that 1 μg poly [d(I-C)] (Roche, Cat# 10108812001) was added to the above protein-DNA reaction mixtures listed in Table 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6].\nCompetitive EMSA process\nTiming: 7 h",
    "This section describes the competitive EMSA process. A competitive EMSA can be used to evaluate the specificity of protein binding activity to DNA, using the same sequence but unlabeled DNA fragment. Excessive unlabeled DNA fragments could compete with the labeled probes for protein binding. With the concentration increase of the unlabeled DNA fragments, the binding of DIG-labeled DNA probes to proteins would decrease. Therefore, in the competition experiment design, the utilized concentration of the unlabeled DNA in experiment can reach to 50–100 times more than the labeled probe. Those unlabeled DNA fragments effectively compete for the binding of the target protein to the DIG-labeled DNA fragments, and the retarded band is expected to weaken or even disappear if the target protein has specific binding activity to the tested DNA probe. (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2044-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. A figure illustrated the schematic diagram of the competitive EMSA assay\nTarget protein, DIG-labeled DNA probe and 50–100 fold more unlabeled DNA probe are co-incubated at specific conditions for reaction (left panel). The reaction mixtures without (1) or with (2) unlabeled DNA probe are loaded into a native PAGE gel, and immunoblotted to detect competitive protein-DNA interaction (middle and right panel). Those unlabeled DNA probe effectively compete for the binding of the target protein to the DIG-labeled DNA probe, and the retarded band is expected to disappear if the target protein has specific binding activity to the tested DNA probe.\nPrepare the competitive EMSA reaction buffers on ice as indicated in Table 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl8]. Mix well gently by pipette and spin down with a short time.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2044_19.csv",
    "Note: The reaction system and conditions of the competitive EMSA process should be exactly same as the reactions in the previous EMSA process, except for the changes in DNA composition and content, so as to eliminate the interference factors of the experiment and ensure the accuracy of experimental results interpretation.\nNote: The reaction performed for the ler promoter and negative control rpoS should be same.\nPerform the protein-DNA reaction program as indicated in above step 3d and Table 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl7].\nPerform the steps 3e–9 for protein-DNA binding signal detection."
