    "Habituation sessionThis step is performed to familiarize mice with the maze. The habituation session lasts for 9 min.Turn on the video recording system and set the parameters for data acquisition: Make sure that there is constant uniform lightning conditions in the maze (areas of interest, contrast for mouse detection, etc.) and in the room throughout the session (habituation, training and test sessions).Place the animal in the maze without objects at the starting point (crossing-point between both arms, Figure 1).At the end of the session, remove the animal from the maze and return it to its home-cage.Then, clean maze and the objects with 70% ethanol and move to the next animal (back to Step A2).Note: In order to avoid that odor cues from previous mice alter mouse exploration, it is crucial to carefully clean the surface of the maze and objects between each session with a 70% ethanol solution.Training sessionThe training session is performed 24 h after the habituation session. The training session lasts for 9 min.Turn on the video recording and data acquisition system.Place two identical objects in the extremities of the maze in direct contact with the wall (see Figures 1 and 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200615/20200615100523_3655.jpgFigure 2. Scheme of the object recognition protocol. There are three different sessions (habituation, training and test) and each session lasts 9 min. Short- or long-term memory can be assessed depending on the inter-session interval between the training and the test session.Place the animal at the starting point facing towards the edge of the two arms (crossing-point between the two arms).Use the stopwatches, to record the time that the mouse spends exploring each object (see below). During this session, rodents usually spend around 50% of the total exploratory time for each one of the objects.",
    "At the end of the training session, remove the mouse from the maze and leave it undisturbed in its home-cage.After cleaning the maze as explained in the “habituation session” of the maze, start the training session for the following animal.Pharmacological treatmentsPharmacological treatments can be used to study cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in different memory phases of NOR. For instance, in order to test the effect of a particular pharmacological treatment on memory acquisition (Figure 2), the drug must be administered before the training session. The administration time must be adjusted by taking in consideration the pharmacokinetics of the substance. Moreover, it is important to verify that the drug has no locomotor effects as it may influence the task outcome independently of the memory performance (e.g., impaired locomotor activity may affect exploration and consequently the capacity of the animal to move towards the objects to explore them). To study the effect of a pharmacological treatment on memory consolidation, the drug should be administered after the training session. Finally, to assess memory re-consolidation, mice are re-exposed to the same training conditions (same combination of objects during a 9 min session) 24 h after the first training session and the drug can be administered before or after the second training session. Testing phaseThe test session could be performed 3 h after training to evaluate short-term memory, or 24 h after training to evaluate long-term memory. The training session lasts for 9 min.Turn on the video recording and data acquisition system.Clean the maze.Place one of the familiar objects at the end of one arm and the novel object at the end of the other arm. The position of the novel object (i.e., right vs.",
    "left arm) must be counterbalanced in between mice to avoid any possible confounding cue in the room that results in a preference for one of the arms of the maze.Place the animal at the starting point, as previously mentioned above.As in the previous sessions (habituation and training sessions), the observation is accomplished by a closed-circuit camera attached to a recording system to avoid unnecessary stress or uncontrolled cues to the animal (see Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Representative video showing object exploration in both arms of the maze Use two stopwatches and assign each stopwatch to record the exploration time for each object. The experimenter, blind to the experimental conditions, measures the exploration time for each object analyzing the image obtained by the closed-circuit camera. Simultaneously, the video is recorded for documentation purposes together with video-tracking of general activity (time spent in each arm, number of entries in each arm and distance travelled).At the end of the test session, remove the animal from the maze and return it to the home-cage. After cleaning the maze with water, start with another animal (back to Step C3).After the session, export the experimental data and analyze the results (see Data analysis).Note: If the total exploration time is very low (< 5-10 s) in the training and/or test sessions the results of these mice are not considered for the experiment. This may happen due to:The object is not adequate for the task (i.e., it may induce stress or anxiety to the animals). Verify that the object was properly cleaned as it could contain the odors of a previous animal and re-evaluate the objects to understand if there is intrinsic preference or aversion.",
    "The animal does not explore the maze because of a locomotor deficit or it does not explore the maze due to a pharmacological treatment and/or a genetic manipulation. If there is a clear locomotor alteration during the performance of the task, exclude the animal from the analysis."
