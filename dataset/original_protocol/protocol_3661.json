Thus [3H]myo-inositol is used to analyze the biosynthesis of IPC and other inositol-containing lipids. This section describes how to label yeast cells with [3H]myo-inositol and analyze radiolabeled IPC by thin-layer chromatography (TLC).\n[3H]myo-inositol is a radiolabeled compound that contains the radioisotope tritium (3H). Thus, be sure to comply with the laws and regulations regarding the use, storage, disposal, and other handlings of radioactive isotopes established by the national, state, and agency. The work described in this protocol must be performed as follow the CRITICAL Notes below.\nCritical: Experimental operation must be performed in a laboratory space that is appropriately designated for radiolabeled work.\nCritical: Experimental operation must be performed by authorized staffs that have formal institutional training in the handling, use, disposal, cleanup, and decontamination of radiolabeled substances.\nCritical: Depending on federal, state, local, and institutional policies, handling with the level of radiation (250 μCi) present in the commercial [3H]myo-inositol stock solution used for this work may require special environmental testing requirements (i.e., wipe testing of the benchtop); consultation with the institutional radiation safety officer before beginning work is highly recommended.",
    "Critical: All vials, tubes, pipette tips, discarded medium, discarded water washes, cell debris, TLC plates, solvent systems that contain [3H]myo-inositol is considered radioactive and should be discarded appropriately.

Scoop with something like a small spoon and add to the tube #1.\nNote: Do not allow glass beads to get into the gap between the tube and the cap, because they may cause leakage of organic solvent during vortex mixing.\nAdd 400 μL of chloroform-methanol (CM; 1/1, v/v) to the cell lysate and vortex well at RT.\nCritical: The use of chloroform solvent is a health hazard. When handling this solvent, we recommend using the appropriate PPE.\nNote: To avoid the loss of the sample attached to the pipette tip, use the same tip repeatedly for each sample.\nIn order to extract completely the remaining radiolabeled lipids in the protein pellet in the tube #1, add a 200 μL volume of chloroform-methanol-water (CMW, 10/10/3, v/v/v) to the tube #1 and sonicate for 10–15 min in bath-type ultrasonic cleaner until the pellet is completely resuspended.\nCentrifuge the tube #1 at 20,600 g for 3 min at RT and transfer the supernatant to the tube #2.\nAdd a 100 μL volume of CMW to the tube #1, vortex vigorously, centrifuge at 20,600 g for 3 min at RT, and transfer the supernatant to the tube #2.",
    "Dry the combined supernatants in the tube #2 completely with N2 gas using pressure gas blowing concentrator at 30°C.\nCritical: Drying the CMW in the samples with N2 gas must be done in a draft chamber, to prevent the radioactive-labeled lipid contained in the organic solvents from being aerosolized and contaminating the laboratory space.\nCritical: Confirm with facility staff that maintains the building infrastructure that the draft chamber is equipped with an appropriate engineering control (i.e., trap) that limits radioactivity exposure to ensure that radioactive contamination of N2 or potential exhaust lines for the building does not occur.\nPause Point: Samples can be stored at –20°C (for about 1 month).\nNaOH treatment (Optional) To differentiate complex sphingolipids from glycerophospholipids, lipid extracts can be subjected to mild base hydrolysis with NaOH, which selectively deacylates glycerophospholipids (Puoti et al., 1991[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nAdd 100 μL of CMW to the tube #2, vortex well and centrifuge at 20,600 g for 1 min at RT.\nAdd 16 μL of 0.6 N NaOH (in methanol), vortex well and incubate for 2 h at 30°C.\nCentrifuge at 20,600 g for 1 min at RT.\nAdd 16 μL of 0.6 N AcOH (in methanol), vortex well and centrifuge at 20,600 g for 1 min at RT.\nDry the samples in the tube #2 completely with N2 gas using pressure gas blowing concentrator at 30°C.\nCritical: Drying the CMW in the samples with N2 gas must be done in a draft chamber.\nPause Point: Samples can be stored at –20°C (for about 1 month).\nButanol purification (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1])\nTo desalt, add 100 μL of water to the tube #2, vortex well and spin down at 20,600 g for 1 min at RT.",

When handling this solvent, we recommend using the appropriate PPE such as goggles, gloves (low breakthrough), a mask, a lab coat, and a draft chamber.\nIn order to collect completely the remaining radiolabeled lipids in the water phase in the tube #2, add 100 μL of water-saturated 1-butanol to the tube #2, vortex well, centrifuge at 20,600 g for 3 min at RT and transfer the butanol phase to the tube #3.

For this purpose, a short-chain ceramide, C2-ceramide (N-acetoyl-D-erythro-sphingosine) that reaches the Golgi through a diffusion-mediated or an endocytic route from the plasma membranes when added exogenously to cells can be used (Kajiwara et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). As exogenous C2-ceramide is incorporated into C2-IPC by IPC synthase, C2-IPC synthesis depends on IPC synthase activity and synthesis of phosphatidylinositol precursor. Thus, IPC synthase activity can be assayed using non-radiolabeled C2-ceramide and [3H] myo-inositol.\n[3H]myo-inositol is a radiolabeled compound that contains the radioisotope tritium (3H).
