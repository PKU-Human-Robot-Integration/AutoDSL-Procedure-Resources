    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe protocol below is the main part of this publication. It describes the aminoacylation reaction, the sample preparation, and the mass spectrometric analysis.\nAminoacylation reaction\nTiming: 3.5 h\nThe aminoacylation reaction is performed according to3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] with minor modifications.\nPrepare a fresh ATP solution (c = 100 mM). For this purpose, dissolve 6.0519 mg ATP in 100 μL DEPC-treated water.\nMix the reagents from Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] in the listed order to obtain a reaction mix.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2926_9.csv\nThe table lists the reagents and their amounts to obtain the given, final concentrations.\nAs a reference, prepare a second reaction mix without ArgRS (use DEPC-treated water as a substitute).\nIncubate at 37°C for 3 h. During this time, arginine is attached to the 2′ OH-group of the 3′-terminal adenosine of tRNAArg.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nSample preparation\nTiming: 1 day\nAt this stage the other ingredients in the reaction mix besides the tRNAArg of interest preclude mass spectrometric detection. Detection of aminoacylated tRNAArg in the presence of remaining free tRNAArg is a challenge. Accordingly, the following steps describes purification and digestion of the (aminoacylated) tRNAArg. Treat each reaction mix similarly.\nFor purification of tRNAArg (non-aminoacylated or aminoacylated with arginine), use a RNA purification kit (PureLink miRNA Isolation Kit; Invitrogen) and follow the supplied manual (https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Fpurelink_microRNA_man.pdf[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Fpurelink_microRNA_man.pdf]; last accessed on April 20th, 2023).\nNote: Use one column per reaction mix, start from step 5 in the section “Prepare bacterial lysates” of the manual mentioned above. Use a final elution volume of 50 μL.\nBiotinylate aminoacylated tRNAArg according to7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] with minor modifications. Treat the reference as well.\nDissolve 6.6 mg EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin in 100 μL HEPES buffer (120 mM HEPES, pH 8.0).\nAdd 50 μL of the EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin solution to each purified tRNAArg sample.\nIncubate at 4°C for 12–14 h.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2926-Fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2. Biotinylation of arginyl-tRNAArg\nThe figure shows the reaction of arginyl-tRNAArg with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin. EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin reacts with primary amines7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7],9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] while the guanidine group will be unaffected.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] The resulting molecule is biotinylated arginyl-tRNAArg.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2926-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. SDS-PAGE of tRNAArg and biotinylated arginyl-tRNAArg with streptavidin attached\nThe gel was stained with GelRed to visualize nucleic acids (tRNAArg, A) and Coomassie Blue G250 to visualize protein (streptavidin, B). The two lanes represent an aminoacylation reaction mix where ArgRS was absent (-) or present (+). Without ArgRS, tRNAArg is not aminoacylated so that no biotinylation will occur and streptavidin cannot bind. In the presence of ArgRS arginyl-tRNAArg will be biotinylated. Streptavidin can then bind and increase the mass of the construct substantially. Nucleic acid staining shows a strong band of tRNAArg (see lane A-). This band is also present in lane A+, but with much lower intensity (remaining free tRNAArg). In lane A+, an additional band is present. Using protein stain only, this band is still observed (see lane B+) while the bands of tRNAArg are not (see lane B- and B+). Double staining reveals the presence of nucleic acids (tRNAArg) as well as proteins (streptavidin). This shows the presence of streptavidin-bound biotinylated arginyl-tRNAArg.\nNote: Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] shows the reaction for arginyl-tRNAArg. In solution the NHS esters do not target the guanidine group which remains non-biotinylated.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]\nNote: Biotinylation stabilizes the acyl bond between the tRNA and the amino acid and prevents deacylation that might occur at physiological pH.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] The free tRNAArg in the sample for reference remains non-biotinylated. In addition, biotin acts as a label for mass spectrometry.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9],10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]",
    "Note: At this stage, aminoacylation can be checked for. The method uses toxic/harmful chemicals. How to detect biotinylated aminoacylated tRNA using streptavidin and SDS-PAGE is presented in.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] This method can be modified by first staining the gel for nucleic acid (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A), and subsequently for protein (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). Taken together this shows the presence of biotinylated, aminoacylated tRNA attached to streptavidin, corresponding to a successful aminoacylation reaction. However, it is not possible to determine which amino acids were attached to the tRNA. In addition, Moreover, it is hard to make any statements about the amounts.\nDigest tRNAArg.\nAdd 25 μL RNase A stock solution (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 50% Glycerol, 4 U/100 μL RNase A) and 5 μL of ammonium acetate solution (c = 220 mM) to each sample.\nIncubate at 37°C for 2 h.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2926-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Molecule of interest obtained from RNA digestion of biotinylated arginyl-tRNAArg\nRNase A will cleave the tRNAArg after each C and U resulting in Cp or Up at the 3′ end of the fragment.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] During the aminoacylation of tRNAArg, the amino acid links to the CCA sequence at the 3′ end of the tRNAArg.13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13] Accordingly, the last cleavage site in front of the attached amino acid will be after the last C. The resulting molecule is biotinylated arginyl-adenosine. This is the molecule of interest since it will show which amino acid was attached to the tRNAArg during aminoacylation.\nNote: Mass spectrometric assessments of heterogenous samples with complex ingredients in small quantities is challenging.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] Here, the digestion of tRNA enables direct detection of tRNAArg fragments12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] (with and without attached biotinylated amino acid). No further processing of the data (e.g., deconvolution) is required so that peaks can be directly interpreted. .",
    "Note: The molecule of interest resulting from the digestion of biotinylated aminoacylated tRNAArg is the tRNAArg fragment with attached biotinylated amino acid, biotinylated arginyl-adenosine (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). In the sample for reference, this molecule is missing.\nUse protein concentrators (Pierce Concentrator, PES, 3k MWCO, 0.5 mL; Thermo Fisher Scientific) to separate digested tRNAArg and RNase A.\nNote: Use one concentrator per sample.\nAdd 500 μL ultrapure water to pre-rinse the concentrator.\nCentrifuge at 15,000 × g for 5 min.\nRemove ultrapure water from both chambers.\nAdd the sample to the concentrator.\nCentrifuge at 15,000 × g for 3 h. 3 h are required because of the glycerol in the RNase stock solution.\nTransfer filtrated fraction to a new vial and store at 4°C.\nNote: The concentrators retain RNase A. The filtrated fraction contains molecules smaller than 3 kDa and therefore the tRNAArg fragments (with and without attached biotinylated amino acid) as obtained from digestion.\nMass spectrometry\nTiming: 2 h\nThe final step describes the mass spectrometric method identifying the amino acid of the aminoacylated tRNAArg. Detection of the tRNAArg fragment with attached biotinylated amino acid requires a LC-MS system. Here we use a HPLC system (Prominence UFLC XR System, Shimadzu) coupled with a FT-ICR-MS (7T solariX, Bruker) with ESI. Both instruments communicate via a plug-in (Compass HyStar, Bruker). The HPLC system uses a HPLC column suitable for separation of the different tRNAArg fragments (Aeris 3.6 μm WIDEPORE XB-C8 200 Å, LC Column 150 × 2.1 mm, Phenomenex).\nUse two eluents (A and B).\nEluent A (HPLC grade water with 0.1% HPLC grade FA).\nEluent B (HPLC grade ACN with 0.1% HPLC grade FA).\nDefine a separation method for the HPLC system (Prominence UFLC XR System, Shimadzu).\nSet the column oven temperature to 60°C.\nSet the autosampler temperature to 7°C.",
    "Equilibrate the column with 10% of eluent B at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min until start of the measurement.\nNote: In this step and the following, only the percentage of eluent B is mentioned. The lacking percentage corresponds to eluent A.\nNote: The equilibration takes 10 min. It should be performed prior to calibration of the mass spectrometer.\nUse 20 μL of the sample for the measurement.\nUse a linear gradient program with a constant flow rate of 0.5 mL/min for separation of the molecules in the sample.\nIncrease the percentage of eluent B from 10% to 30% over 10 min.\nIncrease the percentage of eluent B from 30% to 65% over 10 min.\nHold 65% of eluent B for 3 min.\nDecrease the percentage of eluent B from 65% to 10% over 2 min.\nHold 10% of eluent B for 10 min.\nNote: The last step will equilibrate the column for the next measurement.\nNote: HPLC parameters may vary for other columns.\nDefine a method for the mass spectrometer (7T solariX, Bruker).\nUse the following parameters.\nUse positive mode.\nNote: m/z-values represent [M + H]+.\nUse a mass range from 100 to 1000 Da.\nSet the capillary voltage of the ESI to 4500 V with an End Plate Offset of −500 V.\nSet the Nebulizer Gas pressure to 3.0 bar.\nFor the Dry Gas, use a flow rate of 8 L/min and a temperature of 250°C.\nAcquire single scans with a scan time of 50 ms.\nNote: Parameters regarding ESI and the mass spectrometer may vary for other types of mass spectrometers.\nTo prevent mass drift over longer measurement periods and to maintain a high accuracy use two lock masses during measurement.",
    "Use methyl stearate (299.294457 m/z). For the 7T solariX, apply 50 μL of a methyl stearate solution (c = 5 mg/mL) to the ceramic slides of the lock mass reservoir.\nUse hexakis(2,2-difluoroethoxy)phosphazene (622.028960 m/z). For the 7T solariX, apply 50 μL of a hexakis(2,2-difluoroethoxy)phosphazene solution (c = 1 mg/mL) to the ceramic slides of the lock mass reservoir.\nNote: The masses of the analytes should always be in between the two lock masses.\nCalibrate the mass spectrometer.\nUse a NaTFA solution (c = 0.1 mg/mL) for calibration.\nInject the solution with the syringe pump of the mass spectrometer setting a flow rate of 2 μL/min.\nAcquire 64 scans with the parameters listed in 11 a.\nNote: The scans must be accumulated (single scans are insufficient!).\nCalibrate the mass spectrometer with the obtained spectrum.\nNote: Calibration should achieve an accuracy of 1 ppm. If the error is higher, repeat the steps 12 b–12 d.\nSave the calibration.\nChange the 6-port diverter valve of the 7T solariX back to HPLC.\nSet the number of scans to 1.\nSelect serial mode.\nPrepare the 2 samples (digested tRNAArg; free and aminoacylated with arginine).\nUse 90 μL of the filtrated fraction from step 8 f and add 10 μL of HPLC grade ACN to obtain a final ACN concentration of 10% in the sample. Add 0.1 μL of HPLC grade FA.\nVortex the sample for 10 s.\nBriefly centrifuge for 10 s.\nTransfer the sample to 100 μL inserts placed in HPLC vials.\nPut the HPLC vials into the autosampler (pre-chilled at 7°C).\nCreate a sample list in Compass HyStar and select the written separation and measurement method as well as the saved calibration.\nPerform a measurement on the 2 samples.\nUse a suitable program (Compass DataAnalysis, Bruker) for the evaluation of the obtained data.",
    "Recalibrate the data using the lock masses.\nExtract the ion chromatogram of the analyte. The selected m/z depends on the amino acid that was attached to the tRNAArg via the aminoacylation reaction.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2926-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Molecule detected by mass spectrometry\nThe molecule of interest (biotinylated arginyl-adenosine) could only be detected with low intensity, however, mass spectrometry revealed the presence of biotinylated arginine exhibiting a much stronger peak. This molecule is missing in the sample for reference, showing that it originates from the purified aminoacylated tRNAArg – and not from the aminoacylation reaction mix (containing free amino acids).\nNote: In the mass spectrum the expected analyte, biotinylated arginyl-adenosine (650.28274 m/z), is identified as well as biotinylated arginine (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). Since biotinylated arginine was absent from the sample for reference, it must originate from biotinylated arginyl-adenosine, that is, from the aminoacylated tRNAArg. The removal of adenosine is likely due to acidic hydrolysis caused by FA in the solvent.\nNote: A standard is required to confirm the m/z value of the analyte. Since a standard of biotinylated arginine is easily obtained (see step 24), we decided to focus on this analyte. However, for quantitative analysis the presence of both compounds must be considered. Here, for qualitative analysis, the analyte of interest is biotinylated arginine. Extract the ion chromatogram of biotinylated arginine (401.19655 m/z).\nNote: Theoretical m/z used for ion chromatogram extraction are calculated with the IsotopePattern tool in Compass DataAnalysis (Bruker). The deviation of the measured m/z from the theoretical m/z is determined by the SmartFormula tool in Compass DataAnalysis (Bruker). It must not exceed the error of the calibration of the instrument (here 1 ppm).\nAnalyze the extracted peaks.\nExamine the compound spectrum (The m/z deviation must not be higher than 1 ppm).",
    "Verify that the analyzed molecule is biotinylated arginine by measurement with a suitable standard.\nDissolve 3.3 mg EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin in 50 μL HEPES buffer (120 mM HEPES, pH 8.0).\nAdd 50 μL of arginine working solution.\nIncubate at 4°C for 12–14 h.\nMeasure the sample without further purification with the mass spectrometer as described in this section.\nNote: The retention time and the m/z of the analyzed molecule must not significantly deviate from the standard."
