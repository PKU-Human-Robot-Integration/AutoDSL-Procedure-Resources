    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSample collection\nTiming: 30 min\nSkin 6 mm punch biopsies are obtained by qualified clinicians under local anesthesia. Collected tissue samples are placed in a 15 mL Falcon tube containing 2 mL of RPMI 1640, kept on ice and transferred immediately to the laboratory for further processing.\nCritical: The tissue should be kept on ice and processed right after collection, in any case within 15–30 min.\nPrepare tissue for digestion\nTiming: 15 min\nThe purpose of this step is to dissect the biopsy into smaller pieces to allow optimal enzymatic digestion. Dissection and subsequent steps are performed at 20°C–24°C) unless otherwise stated. All steps have to be performed under sterile conditions.\nPrepare digestion mix in a gentleMACS C tube according to instructions in Miltenyi Whole Skin Dissociation Kit (https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/upload/assets/IM0007590.PDF[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/upload/assets/IM0007590.PDF]).\nThaw one aliquot of each Enzyme (P, A, D).\nTransfer 435 μL of Buffer L into the gentleMACS C tube.\nAdd 12.5 μL of Enzyme P and resuspend carefully.\nAdd 50 μL of Enzyme D and resuspend carefully.\nAdd 2.5 μL of Enzyme A and resuspend carefully.\nNote: As suggested by the manufacturer, adding Enzyme P to the digestion mix will increase the yield, but not preserve surface epitopes like CD4 or CD8. Therefore, be sure to skip the use of this enzyme in case of downstream assays that rely on surface markers, like CITE-Seq for example.\nRinse tissue with PBS to remove remaining blood.\nRemove skin biopsy from the tube, place on a 60 mm petri dish (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) and add 1–2 mL of sterile PBS.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1734-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Key steps of skin processing\n(A) Representative skin biopsy on a saline-soaked compress immediately after excision.\n(B) Biopsy in petri dish during dissection.\n(C) Collection of minced tissue using a scalpel.",
    "(D) Minced biopsy in gentleMACS C tube before attachment to dissociator.\nGently shake the petri dish, then aspirate the PBS. Repeat 2–3 time, if necessary, until clear.\nCompletely aspirate PBS and discard.\nDissect the skin biopsy:\nRemove subcutaneous fat from the biopsy by carefully scraping it using a curved cutting-edge scalpel.\nDissect tissue by fixating the biopsy with forceps and gently cutting it with a curved scalpel (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). Continue until obtaining pieces of 1 mm2 dimension (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nCritical: Wet the scalpel with digestion mix in between to prevent drying of tissue pieces. All dissected pieces have to be maintained moist all the time. Troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Rinsing the cell strainer, related to step 10\nCollect the tissue pieces by scraping them off the petri dish with the scalpel (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nTransfer dissected tissue into the gentleMACS C tube with the prepared digestion mix (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D) and tightly close the lid.\nNote: The procedure is the same also in case of smaller size biopsies, see “expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]”.\nEnzymatic and mechanical tissue dissociation\nTiming: 195 min (with 15 min for step 5)\nThe purpose of this step is to digest the tissue first enzymatically in a water bath and then mechanically using the gentleMACS dissociator.\nPerform the enzymatic digestion:\nTransfer the gentleMACS C tube with the minced biopsy to a pre-heated water bath with shaker at 37°C at 220 RPM for 3 h.\nTake out the gentleMACS C tube from the water bath, add 500 μL of cold tissue culture media (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) to the tube containing the digestion mix with the biopsy and close the lid tightly beyond the first resistance.",
    "Note: We use cold RPMI with 5% FCS, but also other culture media are appropriate, for instance also RPMI 10% FCS. This step is important to increase the volume of liquid for the dissociation step. It stops the digestions and also starts cooling down the cells. After dissociation, all further steps will be performed at 4°C.\nNote: The digestion time is optimized for healthy normal skin, independently of biopsy size. Digestion time can be reduced in case of biopsy taken from lesional skin of patient suffering from inflammatory skin diseases (like psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, active cutaneous lupus and others) or cutaneous skin lymphomas. In some cases, the digestion time can be even reduced to 30 min, but the protocol has to be optimized according to the expected cellular density and the inflammatory stage of the disease, as well as the cell types of interest.\nOptional: The incubation time in the water bath, especially when omitting Enzyme P, can be prolonged to 12–18 h to increase the cell yield. We strongly discourage prolonging the digestion time for single-cell RNA sequencing experiments.\nPerform the mechanical digestion in the gentle MACS dissociator:\nPlace the tube upside down into the slot of the dissociator and check that the tube is correctly attached.\nSelect the program h_skin_01 and run it one time. Troubleshooting problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nCarefully detach the gentleMACS C tube from the dissociator, the content should look opaque.\nPlace the gentleMACS C tube in the pre-cooled centrifuge and spin down the tissue for 1–2 min, 300 g).\nCritical: This quick final centrifugation step is important to make sure that all tissue pieces and liquid droplets on the walls of the tube and on the lid are collected to the bottom of the tube. It is specially needed in case of smaller biopsies.",
    "Note: The wide surface of the bottom part of the gentleMACS tubes allows a good exposure of all tissue to the digestion media. If the tubes and the dissociator are not available, then consider using a 50 mL Falcon tube with 1 ml digestion media for the enzymatic digestion in the water bath.\nPrepare single-cell suspension\nTiming: 20 min\nThe purpose of this step is to finalize the tissue preparation and obtain the skin-derived single cell suspension.\nPlace a sterile 70 μM cell strainer on a fresh 50 mL Falcon tube.\nTake the gentleMACS C tube from the centrifuge, the content will look opaquer and more homogeneous (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A compared to Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D). Briefly vortex it to loosen the tissue (5 s.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1734-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Key steps of single-cell suspension preparation\n(A) GentleMACS tube containing digested pieces of tissue after 3 h digestion processing through the dissociator and short spinning.\n(B) White material remaining in the cell strainer after rinsing.\nTransfer the content of the gentleMACS C tube to the prepared cell strainer by quickly pouring the tube and tapping the tube over the cell strainer to transfer remaining tissue pieces.\nTransfer 10 mL of ice-cold wash buffer (PBS with 10% FCS) into the empty gentleMACS C tube to collect remaining cells.\nRinse the cell strainer ten times with 1 mL of PBS 10% FCS wash buffer from the gentleMACS C tube. Apply rotatory movements to the strainer and the tube in order to make sure to wash the strainer throughout (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1], Rinsing the cell strainer) Troubleshooting problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\nCritical: While rinsing the cell strainer, pay attention to rinse thoroughly in the edges as well.\nAfter all liquid has passed through, discard the cell strainer and close the Falcon tube.",
    "Note: Connective tissue will remain inside the cell strainer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). This can be discarded. Further washing does not improve the cell yield.\nSpin down the cells in the pre-cooled centrifuge for 10 min at 300 g.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant with a suction pump Troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7].\nCritical: In our experience, the pellet is always hard to see at the bottom of the 50 mL Falcon tube. Therefore, when aspirating with the suction pump one has to be extra careful to aspirate only on the side of the tube and leave 10–20 μL of buffer.\nNote: This protocol does not require a red blood cell lysis step, as in our experience the pellet (if visible) never looks red. Furthermore, the use of subcutaneous lidocaine and epinephrine as local anesthetic before taking the biopsy, minimizes the presence of red-blood cells in the tissue. Finally, small cells are excluded during the sorting in the lymphocytes gating.\nStaining of the cells and isolation of live cells\nTiming: 45 min\nThe purpose of this step is to stain the single cell suspension with fluorochrome-labeled antibodies for downstream FACS-purification before 10× Genomics sequencing. The identification and sorting of viable cells are crucial to the protocol, whereas the quantification of the structural cells versus immune cells is facultative. We provide an example in which we used two different TotalSeq hashtag antibodies for skin cells and for PBMCs in order to isolate both cell types from the same individual in a single 10× Genomics reaction. Moreover, we provide an example of a FACS panel that can be applied to the skin cells during the sorting, to make sure that the cells of interest are present in the sorted population.\nDislodge the pellet and resuspend cells in 50 μL of FACS-Sort Buffer.",
    "Add 1 μL of Fc-Block (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) to the 50 μL pellet and live 5 min at 20°C–24°C.\nAdd 50 μL of the antibody mix prepared in FACS buffer.\nNote: Considering that there was already 10–20 μL of liquid left before adding the 50 μL of Fc-block and the 50 μL of antibody mix, the final volume of the staining mix will be slightly more than 100 μL. This is not an issue, as the panel is designed to have an excess of antibodies and the staining is therefore not compromised.\nOptional: The antibody mix does not necessarily have to be prepared before, as the antibodies can also be added freshly to the cells. In this case, the cells can be resuspended directly in 100 μL of FACS staining buffer and the Fc-Block can be added for first (2 μL instead of 1 μL to maintain the dilution). After 5 min (in case of using CITE-seq antibodies, we recommend to extend this incubation time to 15 min), all the rest of the antibodies can be added separately. Quickly vortex the cells after each antibody is added.\nTransfer the whole content into a new FACS-Sort tube and stain for 30 min at 4°C in the dark.\nAdd 1 mL of FACS buffer, and centrifuge at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nResuspend in 200 μL of FACS buffer and keep the tube on wet ice until sorting.",
    "Optional: We recommend to hashtag the skin or PBMCs cells simultaneously with the antibody staining to reduce the time until sample collection. We use 2 μL of Total-Seq Antibody (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) per 100 μL of skin single-cell suspension. If blood from the same donor is processed side by side, we recommend to isolate PBMCs on a Ficoll gradient, stain 1 million PBMCs for CD45+, add a different hashtag (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) and leave for 30 min at 4°C in the dark simultaneously to skin cells. For blood we use 1 μL of a different Total-Seq antibody in 100 μL of FACS-Sort buffer. Before sorting we exclude non-viable PBMCs with 7-AAD as for skin cells.\nNote: If the PBMCs are processed together with the skin, we suggest to perform the PBMCs isolation at 20°C–24°C. We avoid red blood cell lysis for PBMCs, as we usually have a clear pellet after the Ficoll gradient. Moreover, due to the lymphocyte gate during FACS-purification, the small red blood cells are excluded from the sorting.\nNote: We reduced the washing steps after antibody stain to a minimum of one. We prioritize cell yield to antibody specificity for single-cell analysis.\nShortly before sorting the cells add 2 μL of 7-AAD dye directly to the cell suspension and briefly vortex the tube (5 s) Troubleshooting problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1734-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Expected outcome of FACS-Sort and single-cell analysis of CD45+ skin and PBMCs",
    "(A) FACS plot showing the gating of skin cells applied for sorting viable CD45+ or CD45– cells. The figure also shows how we assure that all main cell population of interest are included in the respective gates. For CD45+ cells we check the presence of T cells and non-T cells with CD3. For CD45– cells we check the presence of fibroblasts (CD90+) and other structural cells (like keratinocytes and endothelial cells) which are CD90+HLA-ABC+. In the sample shown, we also checked for CD34 expression to make sure to have follicular keratinocytes).\n(B) Example of the number of single cell population sorted and sequenced after quality control upon a 10× Genomics run. The initial cell input according to the sorter was 10,000 CD45+, 10,000 CD45– and 10,000 PBMC.\n(C) Left: UMAP visualization of CD45+ cells sequenced from the skin (light blue) and PBMCs (light red) after demultiplexing with the hashtags. Middle: single cells expressing αβ-TCR were mapped on the UMAP plot. Right: example of cell identity assignments for skin and blood cells. Figure reprinted with permission from Saluzzo et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6].\nCritical: The cells should be sorted as soon as possible.\nNote: Before sorting the skin cells it is recommended to strain them again through a 40 μL cell-strainer. We skip this step, as we already strained the cells in point 9.-12. and in our experience, we do not need a second straining step.",
    "Note: The manufacturers protocol recommends to wash cells 2 times after the hashtag. In our experience, a single wash-step is sufficient to obtain an almost perfect separation of skin and blood cells (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C) and we therefore prefer to avoid a second centrifugation step as we prioritize timing and yield to antibody specificity. Moreover, further washing of the antibody happens while sorting itself, so once the different hashtag-labeled cells enter the same tube, there should not be free hashtag label antibodies in the mix and no further cell labeling should occur.\nFlow cytometry and cell sorting for 10× Genomics\nTiming: 30 min\nThe purpose of this step is to quantify and sort viable cells into a small collection tube that can be directly subjected to further volume reduction to optimize the viability of the single cells. We perform our FACS-Sort purification with FACSAria III cytometer (BD Biosciences, Vienna, Austria). We sort 30,000 cells in total. Here we provide an example in which we sorted 15,000 CD45+ skin cells and 15,000 CD45+ PBMCs. Note that it is crucial that your sorting machine is running already before initiation of this step. We recommend to sort cells only once you have experience with flow cytometry of the skin biopsies. It is also crucial to perform the compensation setting for the FACS-Sort with multicolor labeled antibodies separately, to avoid further waiting time for the cells and immediately sort after antibody labeling. This protocol assumes a good knowledge of flow cytometry and cell sorting.\nSet the speed of cell/min as low as possible. Acquire 1000 cells and plot the cells on a forward scatter (FSC) versus side scatter (SSC) plot (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nSet the gate on all lymphocytes and exclude doublets with FSC-height vs FSC-width.",
    "Optional: further exclude duplets with the SSC-height vs SSC-area gate.\nFurther plot the cells for viability using the 7AAD marker. Viable cells are 7-AAD negative (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). Troubleshooting problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.11].\nSet a sorting gate for CD45+ cells and a second for CD45- cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nIncrease sorting speed at roughly 1000 cells/s. Collect sorted cells directly into PCR-tubes containing 20 μL sterile PBS with 0.08% BSA.\nNote: Sorting into a PCR tube increases cells yield by avoiding a further centrifugation step. The combination of this protocol with sorting into the tube guarantees a very high yield and we highly recommend it.\nOptional: To compare skin and circulating cells, hashtag-labeled CD45+ PBMCs from the same patient, can be sorted into the same tube as CD45+ cells from skin. Sorting of CD45+ PBMCs is critical to allow selection of viable cells and exclude erythrocytes and duplets via the lymphocytic gate. We provide an example in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B in which we sorted 10,000 CD45+ PBMCs, 10,000 CD45+ skin cells and 10,000 CD45- skin cells and in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C in which we sorted 15,000 CD45+ PBMCs and 15,000 CD45+ skin cells.\nSpin down the cells and resuspend them at a concentration between 700 to 1200 cells/μL to efficiently load the cells onto the chromium chip (10× Genomics) Troubleshooting problem 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.13].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1734_7.csv\nTotal Volume of 50 μL Store at 4°C until use\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1734_8.csv",
    "Critical: Run the cells through the chromium chip (10× Genomics) as soon as possible, as timing is crucial to guarantee cell viability at this point. We recommend to rather invest additional chromium chips for immediate runs and not wait for more samples to be sort-purified. Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] provides an example of how fast the number of captured cells after quality control is reduced if the samples are not immediately processed through the chromium chip after sorting.\nOptional: After FACS-purification the buffer volume can reliably be reduced using the volume reduction device VR-NxT (Silicon Biosystems, Cat #: DA0650). Cells sorted into the appropriate PCR tube (Applied Biosystems MicroAmp Reaction tube, Cat #: N8010612) can be centrifuged for 10 min at 500 g in a centrifuge with swing out rotor. The tube can then be transferred into the VR-Nxt adaptor, closed with the cap (Silicon Biosystems VR-NxT Cap V1.0.0 Cat #: DA0665) following manufacturer’s instructions and volume reduction can be performed using the high-volume setup resulting in a final total volume of 15 μL supernatant, in which the cell pellet is resuspended before loading onto the chromium chip.",
    "Note: If you wish to additionally sort stromal skin cells, consider that the ratio of CD45+ to CD45– cells in the healthy skin of the inner upper arm is roughly 1:3. In other regions of the body, or in lesional skin, this ratio will change. It is fundamental to perform flow cytometry and get familiar with the composition of the skin tissue of interest before proceeding with cell sorting and single cell sequencing. In the healthy skin we sort CD45+ and CD45– cells separately in order to achieve 15,000 CD45+ cells in a tube and 15,000 in a second tube, then we pool volumes together in order to maintain the desired proportion of cells. However, such calculations will of course depend on the aims of each specific experiment. An example of percentage of viable and sorted cells can be found in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A. An example of cellular yield with initial input of 10,000 CD45+, 10,000 CD45– and 10,000 PBMCs viable sorted cells can be found in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B.\nNote: Our protocol is optimized for high quality cellular yield also thanks to the sorting step. In fact, this step allows to get rid of non-viable cells, which are still quite a high percentage (around 20%), exclude doublets, debris and erythrocytes. We therefore strongly recommend sorting before single cell sequencing. The sorting on CD45+ cells we suggest when studying inflammatory skin diseases or in general tissue resident memory T cells. However, of course, a “natural” CD45+/CD45– ratio is also important to maintain, for instance to study cell-cell interactions."
