    "All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care Committee of University Health Network at the Ontario Cancer Institute and conducted in accordance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care Guidelines.\n1. Biological Sample Preparation\nCollect the whole blood, major organs, and breast tumor at predetermined time-points after intravenous (i.v.) administration of drug-containing formulations (e.g., DMPLN, liposomal DOX)\nInject a breast tumor-bearing mouse i.v. with a prepared drug-containing formulation.\nAnesthetize the mouse at designated time-points (e.g., 15 min) by giving inhalable 2% isoflurane in a sealed chamber.\nLay the anesthetized mouse on its back and put its nose through a nosepiece that constantly supplies 2% isoflurane.\n\t\tNOTE: To ensure the mouse undergoes deep anesthesia, gently pinch fore limbs of the mouse and look for any twitching movement.\nThoroughly clean the chest and abdomen regions using 70% ethanol and then perform a terminal procedure of cardiac puncture on the deep anesthetized mice using a heparinized 1 mL syringe and a 23 G needle.\nCollect the whole blood into a labeled sodium heparin sprayed plastic tube and gently swirl the tube to ensure collected whole blood comes into contact with the coated heparin of the tube wall. Collect a minimum of 50 µL of whole blood. Always keep the samples on ice.\nTape all four limbs of the mouse to secure it and open the abdominal cavity and ribcage of the mouse using a pair of scissors and forceps. Shift the intestines to the side and push the liver upward to sufficiently expose the portal vein. Cut the portal vein for the blood drainage.\nPerfuse the whole mouse body with 50 mL of ice-cold 0.9% saline through the heart using a 10 mL syringe with a 25 G needle.",
    "NOTE: Bend the needle at 90° for guiding the syringe into the portal vein.\nExcise organs in the following order: heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidneys. Then, separate the breast tumor from the surrounding connective tissues using a pair of incision scissors at the right mammary fat pad of the mouse. Collect all organs individually into 1.5 mL polypropylene tubes and quickly freeze them in liquid nitrogen.\n\t\t​NOTE: Separate the gallbladder from the liver.\nStore the whole blood at 4 °C and excised tissues in the -80 °C freezer until later HPLC analysis.\nExtract DOX, MMC and DOXol from biological matrices.\nWeigh all frozen dissected tissues quickly and transfer them into a 13 mL rounded-bottom conical tube. To avoid possible drug metabolism or degradation, keep the samples on ice.\nAdd 1-5 mL of ice-cold cell lysis buffer into the tube.\n\t\tNOTE: The volume of buffer to use depends on the tissue weight based on the tissue-buffer ratio of 1 g: 5 mL (w/v); for small organs, such as heart and spleen, the ratio is 1 g: 2 mL.\nUse an up-down stroke motion to homogenize the tissue samples on ice at a speed of 18,000 rpm using an electric hand homogenizer.\n\t\tNOTE: Completed homogenization requires approximately 3 to 5 iterations of a short homogenization process of less than 15 s, followed by tissue cooling over ice between each short homogenization.\nWash the 10 mm saw-tooth generator probe of the homogenizer with distilled deionized (DDI) H2O, 70% ethanol, and then DDI H2O between each tissue sample to avoid cross-contamination.\nTransfer 50 µL of tissue homogenate or whole blood into a 1.5 mL polypropylene micro-centrifuge tube and spike with 5 µL of an internal standard (I.S.) 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) (2000 ng/mL) into the tube.\n\t\tNOTE: 4-MU solution was prepared in methanol here.",
    "Add 250 µL of an ice-cold extraction solvent into the tube containing whole blood or tissue homogenate.\n\t\tNOTE: The extraction solvent consists of 60% acetonitrile (ACN) and 40% ammonium acetate (5 mM) with pH adjusted to pH = 3.5 using 0.05% formic acid. Use a 1:5 (v/v) sample: extraction solvent to volume ratio.\nVigorously vortex the mixture for 2 min, centrifuge at 3,000 x g force at 4 oC for 10 min and pipet 200 µL supernatant into another pre-chilled fresh micro-centrifuge tube.\nEvaporate supernatant at 60 °C under a slow stream of nitrogen gas with protection from light.\nReconstitute the dried residue with 100 µL of ice-cold methanol, vigorously vortex for 30 s and centrifuge at 3000 x g at 4 °C for another 5 min.\nTransfer the supernatant into a HPLC vial insert and place sample vials into an autosampler tray for injection.\n2. HPLC Instrumentation and Operation Parameters\nPrepare HPLC mobile-phase with consistent reproducibility\nMeasure 500 mL of HPLC-grade H2O using a graduated cylinder.\nMeasure 500 mL of HPLC-grade acetonitrile (ACN) using a separate graduated cylinder.\nCarefully add 0.5 mL of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (CAUTION) into each of 500 mL of H2O and ACN to obtain the mobile phase of H2O and ACN containing 0.1% TFA, respectively.\n\t\tNOTE: TFA is corrosive and toxic and should be handled under a laboratory fume hood. All solvent mixtures are prepared at room temperature.\nFilter mobile phases through a nylon membrane filter with a 0.45 µm pore size and transfer it into clean HPLC reservoir bottles.\nSet-up HPLC instrumentation for simultaneous detection of DOX, MMC, and DOXol and I.S. 4-MU.\nSwitch on the gradient pump, de-gasser, auto-sampler, photodiode array detector, and multi λ fluorescence detector.",
    "Input the initial conditions of mobile-phase composition to 16.5% H2O (0.1% TFA) and 83.5% ACN (0.1% TFA) (v/v).\nSet the UV detector on two channels, one at 310 nm for 4-MU (I.S.) and the other at 360 nm for MMC.\nSet the fluorescence detector on two channels, one at λex/λem =365/445 nm for 4-MU and the other at λex/ λem=480 nm/560 nm for DOX and DOXol, respectively.\nSet an isocratic flow rate of 1.0 mL/min.\nEquilibrate a preinstalled reverse phase C18 column (4.6 mm x 250 mm, 5 µm) at room temperature for 10 min for baseline establishment.\nSeparate drugs (DOX, MMC, DOXol and 4-MU) using gradient mobile-phase condition.\nInject 15 µL of extracted and re-concentrated samples using the auto-sampler.\nGradually change the initial mobile-phase condition (refer to protocol step 2.2.2) to 100% ACN (0.1% TFA) over 18 min using the automated gradient pump.\n\t\tNOTE: During the separation process, four channels (two UV absorbent and two fluorescent) appear simultaneously with each channel displaying one drug compound (refer to Protocol step 2.2.3 and 2.2.4).\nMaintain 100% of ACN (0.1% TFA) for 1 min and then return to the initial mobile phase condition within 1 min.\nRe-condition the column with the initial mobile phase at flow rate of 1.5 mL/min for 4 min for the next sample injection.\n3. HPLC Validation\nPrepare working standards of DOX, MMC and DOXol, and 4-MU (I.S.).\nWeigh separately 1 mg of DOX and MMC drug powder (CAUTION) and 4-MU on a fresh small weighing paper (3 x 3 inches2).\n\t\tNote All anticancer drugs are considered a health hazard that can cause acute toxicity and germ cell mutagenicity on inhalation or ingestion. They should be handled carefully with gloves and masks.\nTransfer the weighed DOX, MMC and 4-MU into a new individual 1.5 mL polypropylene micro-centrifuge tube.",
    "Add 1 mL of methanol and vortex briefly to obtain 1 mg/mL concentration of DOX and MMC.\nAdd 1 mL of methanol into a vial containing pre-weighed 1 mg of DOXol (CAUTION) and vortex briefly to obtain 1 mg/mL concentration of DOXol.\n\t\tNOTE: DOXol is a cardio-toxic metabolite and should be handled carefully.\nPipette 20 µL of prepared stock solutions of DOX, MMC, DOXol and 4-MU into a new separate 1.5 mL polypropylene micro-centrifuge tube and add 980 µL of methanol to obtain a working standard of 20 µg/mL of each drug.\nDilute 20 µg/mL of DOX, MMC and DOXol using methanol to obtain the working standards of 50 ng - 20 µg /mL for DOX, MMC, and DOXol and 2000 ng/mL for I.S. 4-MU.\nSeal the cap of the tube of working solutions with a narrow piece of paraffin film covering to prevent methanol evaporation, wrap the entire tube with aluminum foil to avoid exposure to direct light and store at -20 °C.\nDetermine the linearity, precision, and accuracy of DOX, MMC and DOXol in biological matrices (i.e., whole blood and tumor homogenate).\nSimultaneously spike 5 µL of working standards of DOX and DOXol (50 ng/mL - 20 µg/mL), MMC (1,000 ng/mL - 16 µg/mL), and 4-MU (2 µg/mL) into 50 µL of blank whole blood or tissue homogenate in polypropylene micro-centrifuge tubes to obtain the standard concentration curve ranging from 5 - 2000 ng/mL for drug compounds and 200 ng/mL for 4-MU (I.S.).\nPerform the drug extraction assay described in Protocol 1.2.\nUse low, median and high concentrations of DOX and DOXol (50, 500, and 2,000 ng/mL) and MMC (100, 1000, 2,000 ng/mL) for intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy.\n\t\tNOTE: Prepare fresh standard concentrations on the day of analysis.\nAnalysis of samples",
    "Inject 15 µL of the sample using the auto-sampler.\nGradually change the mobile phase over 0 to 18 min, increasing the composition of ACN over the interval.\nAfter 18 min, hold the mobile phase condition for 1 min.\nReturn to the initial condition over the next 2 min, then re-equilibrate for 4 min before the next injection.\nAfter each sample run, note that the peaks of drug compounds with their retention time are shown as follow: MMC, DOXol, 4-MU (I.S.) and DOX.\nIntegrate the peak area under curve (AUC) of drug compounds using HPLC software.\nCalculate the AUC ratio between individual drug compound and I.S. (Equation 1) and use the standard curves prepared under the same extraction procedures to determine the drug concentrations of DOX, MMC and DOXol in DMPLN formulation.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56159/56159eq1.jpg\nCalculate the drug recovery percentage (Equation 2) by comparing the drug concentrations reconstituted using methanol from the extracts of spiked biological samples to that of the standard (\"neat\") drug solution in methanol.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56159/56159eq2.jpg\nSubscription Required.
