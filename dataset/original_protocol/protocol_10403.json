    "1. Master Fabrication\nUse deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) of a silicon on insulator (SOI) wafer to fabricate a master silicon wafer as described in former works32, 33.\n\tNOTE: DRIE is preferred to standard SU-8 micromachining due to the high aspect ratio features (40 µm wide and 90 µm deep trenches).\n2. Casting and Sealing of the Microfluidic Device\nMix PDMS and curing agent at a 10:1 weight ratio inside a clean small container such as a plastic weighing dish.\nDegas the mixture in a desiccator under vacuum until all air bubbles are removed.\n\tNOTE: Prepare enough PDMS for all subsequent steps. Here below, the acronym \"PDMS\" refers always to the degassed 10:1 PDMS:curing-agent mixture that was prepared in steps 2.1 and 2.2.\nPour the degassed-mixture to a height of approximately 1 mm above the master wafer. Degas once again for at least 40 min to remove all the air bubbles above the wafer and minimize the bubbles below the wafer.\n\tNOTE: Make sure that the wafer is as close as possible to the bottom of the plate. If necessary press the wafer gently to the bottom using 2 stirring sticks and degas once again.\nBake at 65 °C for 20 min in a natural convection oven.\n\tNOTE: After 20 min the PDMS is hardened and almost fully cured. While a longer baking time is possible baking for 20 min saves time and improves the adherence of the second PDMS layer (see below) to the first one.",
    "File the barrel section of a plastic 2 ml syringe using a fine grit sand paper to improve adherence to PDMS. In addition, use the sand paper to flatten the base of the syringe barrel by placing the sand paper on a flat surface and sliding the base of the syringe barrel on top of it. Clean the syringe using pressurized air.\nPlace the barrel section of the syringe on top of the first PDMS layer with the large opening facing the surface of the PDMS, and pour a second layer of PDMS on top of the first one to a height of ~5 mm, and degas the PDMS once again in a desiccator.\n\tNOTE: The second PDMS layer should be poured from the small container around the barrel, and should not enter within it. \nBake the entire setup at 65° C for at least 2 hr in a natural convection oven.\n\tNOTE: There is no need to hold the barrel in place during the curing processes since the weight of the PDMS pressing against the wide base of the barrel holds the barrel firmly in place.\nCut through the PDMS mold around the patterned region of the master wafer using a scalpel. While cutting, the scalpel should weakly touch the surface of the wafer. Then, gently insert a thin tool such as wafer forceps in the notch created by the scalpel, and peel off the PDMS cast from the master wafer.\nPlace the cast on a soft surface covered with aluminum foil with the patterned side facing up (i.e., the barrel should hang from the edge of the table), and punch a hole in the PDMS at the chamber inlet and channel inlet using a 1 mm biopsy punch.",
    "Coat a clean glass slide with a (degassed) 10:1 PDMS:curing-agent mixture using a spin coater programmed at 3,000 rpm for 30 sec, and bake for >1 hr at 65 °C. Then, clean the slide and PDMS cast using clear tape.\nTreat the surface of the PDMS mold and PDMS coated glass slide with O2 plasma (e.g., using a hand-held corona treater) for 1 min, and then gently press the surfaces together and bake at 65 °C overnight (O/N).\n3. Device Filling and Actuation\nMix water suspended fluorescent polystyrene particles with water and glycerol in a glass vial to obtain a 64/36 (v/v) glycerol/water mixture with 0.25% (w/w) particles..\nPlace a drop of the glycerol solution on top of the channel inlet and a drop of DI water on the chamber inlet, then place the apparatus inside a desiccator and vacuum for ~5 min.\n\tNOTE: Before releasing the vacuum wait for the bubbles that form in the drops of glycerol solution and DI water to pop. Upon vacuum release the liquids are sucked into the voids inside the device. If residual air remains inside the channels, eliminate it by applying external pressure on the fluids (e.g., using a syringe) and allowing the air to diffuse into the PDMS.\nInject ~2 ml of DI water into the top chamber (i.e., the syringe barrel, Fig. 2b) until it is fully filled with water. Then cover the top chamber with a 19 gauge blunt syringe tip, cut the tip of another blunt 19 gauge syringe tip and insert this tip to the side chamber inlet. Connect both syringe tips to a 1 ml syringe via thin Teflon tubing and a T-shaped connector.",
    "NOTE: Make sure that the 1 ml syringe, Teflon tubing, T-shaped connector and top chamber (2 ml syringe barrel) are all filled with water without bubbles. This may be achieved by opening connection points, pushing water through empty sections of tubing and reconnecting the connection points.\nConnect the 1 ml syringe to a syringe pump pre-programmed to mimic for example a quiet tidal breathing cycle (with a period of T = 4 sec) constructed of linear ramps, i.e., from zero to 1.8 ml/min in 1 sec, from 1.8 ml/min to -1.8 ml/min in 2 sec and from -1.8 ml/min back to zero in 1 sec.\n4. Flow Visualization Experiments: Micro-particle Image Velocimetry (µPIV)\nWhile the device is being actuated, obtain a series of 9 - 12 phase-locked, double-frame images of the particle-seeded flow using a micro-particle image velocimetry (µPIV) system consisting for example of a dual frame-multiple exposure CCD camera (e.g., 1,600 × 1,200 pixels to achieve sufficient resolution), a double pulsed Nd-YAG laser (wavelength: 532 nm, output energy: 400 mJ, pulse duration: 4 nsec), and an inverted microscope.\n\tNOTE: Such a system is capable of obtaining frame pairs with a time lag of down to a few microseconds between the first and second frames. To achieve phase-locked double frame images, it is useful to acquire a double frame series at e.g., 10 Hz (frame pairs are separated by 0.1 sec from one another). Then, the data may be reorganized so that all frame pairs that are separated by a full cycle time (here T = 4 sec) form a new time series. Image acquisition should be repeated several times while modifying the lag time between the first and second frames in each frame pair (i.e., 100 µsec to 0.1 sec) for resolving different flow regions inside the alveolar cavity.",
    "Note: alternative setups with regards to best combinations of image acquisition systems (i.e., camera) and illumination sources (i.e., lasers) to image such microflows are also available34, 35.\nUse a sum-of-correlation algorithm to compute phase-locked velocity vector maps of the resulting flow field from the image series for each time lag used. Repeat this process several times with varying lag times between the first and second frames in each frame pair for resolving different flow regions inside the alveolar cavity. Next, use a data analysis program to stitch together the individual flow maps into a complete and high-detailed map of flow patterns by averaging overlapping data points33.\nSubscription Required.
