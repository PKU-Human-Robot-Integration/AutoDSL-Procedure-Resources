    "Growth and synchronization of transgenic C. elegans populationWhen working with a transgenic strain with integrated genetic array (Table 1), use a sterile pipette tip (200 µl) to cut a small chunk (0.5 x 0.5 cm) of agar containing animals from an older plate and transfer it to a freshly Escherichia coli (OP50) seeded NGM plate (see Recipes). When working with a transgenic line with a non-integrated extrachromosomal array, pick ~25 L4 larvae or adult transgenic animals based on the selection-marker to a freshly OP50 seeded NGM plate.Incubate the nematodes at the standard temperature of 20 °C.3.5 days later the plates contain a mixed population of larval stages.Synchronize nematodes by picking ~30 transgenic animals in L4 stage under a dissecting stereomicroscope and transfer them onto separate OP50 seeded plates. The L4 stage can be identified based on the presence of a half-moon shaped light structure in the area of the vulva and the relative size of the animal (Figure 1).Grow the animals for 24 h at 20 °C into day 1 adults and proceed with mounting the sample (Procedure B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170115/20170115215523_1092.jpgFigure 1. Identification of C. elegans larval stages in a mixed population. The image depicts all 4 larval stages, young adult and day 1 adult as seen under a dissecting stereomicroscope. The arrow indicates the half-moon shaped structure in the area of the vulva, which is indicative for the L4 larval stage.Mounting animals for imagingPrepare fresh 5% agarose pads (see Recipes).Pipette 3 µl polystyrene beads suspension in the center of the agarose pad.Use a platinum wire to pick ~30 transgenics from the OP50 seeded plates into the polystyrene bead suspension.Gently place a coverslip on top of the agarose/worm suspension and proceed with the imaging procedure.",
    "Optionally, the agarose pads can be sealed with nail polish, which will retain humidity for long-term (> 3 h) imaging.Animals can be recovered from unsealed plates by gently lifting one edge of the coverslip with the help of a scalpel and adding 10 µl of M9 buffer to suspend the worms. Subsequently, worms can be transferred with an eyelash to OP50-seeded NGM plates.Imaging P body/SG number with an epifluorescence light microscopeStart up the light microscope and imaging software (ZEN, Zeiss).Place the agarose pad on the imaging stage of the fluorescent light microscope and locate the animals. Use a 10x objective to image the whole animal.Use the DIC channel to focus on an anatomical landmark. Most appropriate are the grinder and the lumen of the pharynx, which are located in the most central transverse (horizontal) position within the animal (Figure 2A).Change to the fluorescent channel to visualize P body or SG-specific fluorescence and define exposure time and fluorescent light intensity. These parameters depend on the transgene and have to be defined empirically. Saturation of the fluorescent signal has to be avoided by lowering exposure time and/or fluorescent light intensity. However, too short exposure might result in lowered sensitivity of detecting RNP granules (Figure 2B). For transgenes that co-express various reporters for P bodies/SGs repeat this step in the corresponding fluorescent channel.Once the best imaging conditions are determined, take a snapshot of all fluorescent channels and the DIC channel. Take images of at least 25 animals to obtain enough data for statistical analysis.Save the data as an image stack. Zeiss microscopes produce *.czi file formats, which can be processed by ImageJ/Fiji freeware (see Data analysis). However, images can also be stored/exported and further processed in any other common format including *.jpg, *.png, *.tiff, etc., and then proceed with the data analysis.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170115/20170115215725_6942.",

(Full genotype of transgenic animal: N2;Ex[pdcap-1DCAP-1::dsRED; pRF4] published in Rieckher et al., 2015.)Imaging P body/SG number, dynamics and colocalization with a confocal microscopeStart up the confocal microscope and corresponding imaging software.Activate the appropriate laser(s) for fluorescent detection of P body/SG reporters.Locate the animal through the eyepiece with a 10x objective using transmission light and center the field of view on the area of interest (e.g., the pharynx).Upon localization, switch to the 40x objective and readjust the focus.In the confocal operating software (acquisition) design a protocol for a z-stack scan.Different RNP granules significantly vary in size and intensity across different transgenes and within samples (Teixeira et al., 2005). Hence, a balance has to be established empirically between laser power and gain (voltage of photomultiplier tubes [PMTs]/detectors) to set the highest and lowest detection limit. If available, use the Smart Setup as a starting point. Try to avoid overexposure but test the lower detection limit by stepwise increasing laser power and/or gain. The final settings have to be reproducibly applied to all samples. For the example in Figure 2 we use the tunable laser at 570 nm (excitation dsRED), laser power 3%, and Master gain 580.",
    "Keep the pinhole size for an optimal section thickness at 1 AU.The distance between z-stacks (slices) should be maximum 1.5 µm. Decreasing z-stack distance might enhance the capability to detect smaller RNP granules but increases photobleaching. Cover a similar volume in each scanned sample. We perform 30 z-stacks at 1.5 µm across the pharyngeal region (Figures 2 and 3).Assign the frame size (resolution). We use 1024 x 1024 (Figures 2 and 3).Use the transmitted light detector (T-PMT) to produce a DIC/Brightfield image in parallel (optional).Once the best imaging conditions are determined, perform a scan of the fluorescent channel. When imaging different P bodies/SGs co-expressed in the same transgene use sequential scan for additional fluorescent channels. Take datasets of at least 15 animals to obtain enough data for statistical analysis.Upon completion of the scan use the processing mode of the ZEN software to produce a maximum intensity projection (MIP), summarizing the fluorescence intensity of all stacks in one image (Figures 3A and 3B). Consistently save as *.czi file or other image file format. Proceed with data analysis. Alternatively, single stacks or subsets of stacks can be processed and analyzed.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170115/20170115215934_2852.jpgFigure 3 Representative images of the pharyngeal region of an adult transgenic animal expressing the P body reporter DCAP-1::dsRED and the SG reporter IFE-2::GFP.
