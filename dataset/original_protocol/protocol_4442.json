    "Measuring lux reporter expression in culturePlate bacterial strain from -80 °C frozen stock in a petri plate containing solid rich B medium, with TTC and selecting antibiotics (in this case gentamicin) overnight at 30 °C.Next day, get one colony from the plate, and grow bacterial strain overnight in a culture tube with 5 ml of rich B liquid medium (do not add TTC) in a shaker at 30 °C.The next day, make a ¼ dilution of the bacterial culture and measure its concentration using a UV visible spectrophotometer.Prepare minimal medium (MM) (20 ml per sample) into 150 ml flasks. Dilute overnight bacterial cultures in fresh MM adjusting bacterial concentration to a final OD600 of 0.1 in MM (approximately 108 cells/ml).Grow bacterial cultures at 30 °C with shaking at 200 rpm.Take 1 ml samples of the bacterial cultures every hour during 8 h starting at 0 h (control) for a total of 9 samples.For each sample, measure bacterial OD600 using the UV visible spectrophotometer and luminescence using a luminometer (express as Relative Luminescence Units or RLU). We have not used different luminometers; however, using different machines should not have an effect, because what matters are the relative measurements. Each machine should be calibrated with the control (not inoculated tissue) and all subsequent measurements are made with respect to the control for that machine. Establish background levels of luminescence. Create a correlation between bacterial concentration OD600 and RLU units (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150429/20150429191411_3959.jpgFigure 3. Correlation between cell number and luminescence in in vitro cultures of UY031 Pps-lux. Overnight cultures of the bacterial strain carrying the PpsbA::luxCDABE gene fusion were diluted in Minimal Medium and bacterial growth and reporter output were measured, respectively through OD600 and luminescence emission of 1 ml aliquots taken over an eight hour time-course.",
    "RLU= Relative luminescence unitsPlant inoculation and disease ratingPlate bacterial strain carrying the pRCG-Pps-lux plasmid, from -80 °C frozen stock in a petri plate containing solid rich B medium, with TTC and selecting antibiotics (in this case gentamicin) overnight at 30 °C.Next day, get one colony from the plate and grow bacterial strain overnight in a 20 ml culture tube with 5 ml of rich B liquid medium (do not add TTC) in a shaker at 200 rpm at 30 °C.Pellet bacterial cells by centrifugation on a tabletop centrifuge at 5,914 x g for 2 min.Re-suspend the bacterial cells in 2 ml of water and spectrophotometrically adjust the concentration to 100 CFU/ml (corresponding to 0.01 OD600).Slightly damage the roots of four-week-old plants (S. commesonii and S. tuberosum in our case) by making three holes in the soil of each pot with a 1-ml pipette tip (2 cm deep) around the plant stem prior to inoculation. See Video 1 for more detail.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Drench inoculation of potato with Ralstonia solanacearum Drench-inoculate plants with 40 ml of a bacterial suspension at a concentration of 100 CFU/ml (corresponding to 0.01 OD600) per 12 cm 3 pots.After inoculation, keep plants in a growth chamber at 27 to 28 °C (65% relative humidity) with a 12 h photoperiod.Record disease development daily using an ordinal disease index scale ranging from 0 (no wilting symptoms) to 4 (all leaves wilted) (Winstead and Kelman, 1952) (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150429/20150429191428_2595.jpgFigure 4.

    "Visualize bacterial colonization of the whole plants using a Fujifilm LAS4000 light imager system with the following settings: Chemiluminescence method, incremental exposure time of 2 min, sensitivity/resolution set to high binning (Figure 5). Evaluate plants daily to assess for pathogen colonization.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150429/20150429191450_4271.jpgFigure 5. Bacterial colonization of whole plants using the non-disruptive method with the LAS4000 light imager system (Zuluaga et al., 2014). Days after inoculation= daiExample of the applicability of the protocol: Using bacterial visualization in planta as a tool to select for resistant potato genotypes against R. solanacearum.Visualization of pathogen colonization in planta using LAS4000: Correlation between disease symptoms and bacterial colonization of the plant tissue is not always direct, due to potential latent growth. The pictures below illustrate that some plants with symptoms ratings of zero (no disease) are colonized by bacteria (Figure 6). Using a bacterial strain transformed with the pRCG-Pps-lux plasmid could be especially useful in plant breeding to detect latency in symptomless parental lines before their inclusion in long-term disease resistance breeding programs. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150429/20150429191514_5292.jpgFigure 6. High-throughput non-disruptive evaluation of potato germplasm using R. solanacearum Lux::CDABE strain to assist selection of resistant genotypesBacterial quantification: Disruptive method using a luminometer (Berthold FB 12).To quantify bacteria present in plants in a high-throughput manner, and avoid bacterial dilution plating and colony counting, collect one-cm sections of the root system or the stem from 1 cm above or below ground depending on the tissue to evaluate (1 cm below ground in this case, since we are evaluating root colonization).Introduce cut section (1 cm root tissue) in a 2 ml Eppendorf tube.Measure luminescence directly from the cut sections with a luminometer (Berthold FB 12).Weight each sample. Correct luminescence readings for the amount of tissue present in each sample to express the final values in RLU per milligram of tissue (Figure 7).",
    "Use the RLU/OD600 curve generated (Figure 3) to estimate bacterial concentration.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150429/20150429191536_9620.jpgFigure 7. Pathogen colonization is presented for four different potato genotypes with contrasting resistance to R. solanacearum. Tissue colonization is measured as Relative Luminescence Units (RLU) divided by the wet weight of the roots in milligrams (mg). Non-inoculated (N. I.) plant was used as a negative control."
