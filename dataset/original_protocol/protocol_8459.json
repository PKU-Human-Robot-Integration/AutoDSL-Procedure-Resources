    "Wild-type C57BL/6 mice (Males; 10-12 weeks) were kept in standard 12 h light/dark cycle and were provided free access to standard chow diet and water. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance to the relevant guidelines by the local Animal Care and Use Committee and approved by the local Animal Care and Use Committee at the regional authority in Karlsruhe, Germany (G216/10).\n1. Perfusion of the Mouse\nSacrifice the mouse (C57BL/6; Males; 10-12weeks) using CO2 or in accordance with local regulations.\n\tNOTE: Retro-orbital bleeding can be performed to obtain control leukocytes, using EDTA-coated 1.5 mL tubes. This method of bleeding is only efficient immediately after the sacrifice. Further, peritoneal cavity lavage (PCL) can be performed to obtain control macrophages, using pre-heated PBS at 37 °C to avoid cold agglutination of the blood, which may hamper perfusion.\nDisinfect the mouse by spraying the fur on the abdomen liberally with 70% v/v ethanol and repeatedly wiping with a tissue with cotton gauze. Using blunt scissors, cut open the abdominal skin by a longitudinal incision.\nExpose the pleural cavity by first making an incision into the diaphragm using curved, blunt scissors and then extending the incision along the entire length of the rib cage. Make a similar cut on the contralateral side until the sternum can be carefully lifted away.\nWith a clear view of the heart and the major vessels, insert a butterfly 23¾ gauge needle, connected to a 50 mL syringe filled with ice-cold PBS, into the left chamber of the heart.",
    "Make an incision to the right atrium of the heart using iris scissors to create as large of an outlet as possible without damaging the descending aorta, and then gently depress the syringe to push through approximately 30 mL of PBS. The exudate should be running clear. The clearing of the liver and/or kidneys can be used as an indicator of a good perfusion.\n2. Dissection of Sciatic Nerve and DRG\nNOTE: For the dissection of the sciatic nerves, the skin above the gluteus maximus is removed and the mouse is positioned ventral side down whilst stretching out the lower limbs.\nBilaterally dissect the whole sciatic nerves by separating the muscle tissue from the upper dorsal thigh, and follow the nerve up along the spinal column. Cut the nerve where it exits from the spinal column and immediately above the knee at the other end.\n\tNOTE: Avoid excessive handling of the nerve such as crushing or pulling with forceps.\nUsing forceps, transfer the excised nerve(s), approximately 2 cm per nerve, to a 1.5 mL tube containing 1 mL of ice-cold PBS and store on ice.\n\tNOTE: The nerve can be stored overnight on ice.\n\tNOTE: For the DRG dissection, using forceps and a scalpel, detach the skin from the underlying soft tissue by gently peeling off the remaining back skin to expose the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal regions. Remove the head by cutting at the base of the skull using a blunt pair of scissors.",
    "Cut the ribs parallel with and close to the spinal column on both sides, before detaching the viscera connected to the anterior side of the spinal column. Cut the femurs and remove the spinal column by a transverse cut at the level of the femurs. Using iris scissors, cut away any muscle, fat, and other soft tissues from the spine.\nPlace the spinal column with the dorsal side facing up and open it, starting at the caudal end, by sliding one tip of the scissors into the vertebral canal at the three o'clock position and the bone snipped. Repeat the procedure at the nine o'clock position.\n\tNOTE: It is important to cut exactly in the center to avoid damaging the DRG.\nRepeat the cutting from side-to-side until the rostral end is reached and the spinal cord is fully exposed. Using a dissection microscope, remove the spinal cord to expose the spinal nerves, which can be used to locate the DRGs within the spine.\nRemove the lumbar DRGs by gently tugging on the dorsal root to pull the DRG into the vertebral canals, then clipping the nerves and connective tissue with iris scissors to remove the DRGs.\n\tNOTE: It is possible to restrict the collection to the L4-L6 DRG, which are contributing to the sciatic nerve.\nUsing forceps, transfer the DRGs to a 1.5 mL tube containing approximately 1 mL of ice-cold PBS, and store on ice.\n\tNOTE: The nerve can be stored overnight on ice.\n3. Digestion of Sciatic Nerve and DRG\nPrepare the digestion media (DMEM, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mg/mL BSA, 1.6 mg/mL collagenase Type 4) supplemented with 100 µg/mL of deoxyribonuclease, and store on ice.",
    "NOTE: The amount of digestion medium required per mouse (sciatic nerves + DRGs) is 1 mL. Once prepared, aliquots of the digestion media can be stored at -20 °C.\nTransfer the sciatic nerves and DRGs from one mouse into separate 1.5 mL tubes containing 500 µL of digestion media. For the sciatic nerves, chop the material into 15-20 pieces using spring scissors and then incubate the tissue suspensions in a shaking incubator at 37 °C for 20 min with gentle agitation (≤ 450 rpm).\nRepeatedly triturate the cell suspension through 1,000 µL pipette tip to mechanically dissociate any incompletely digested tissue.\n\tNOTE: If the suspension is difficult to titrate, then cut the pipette tip with scissors to create a blunt end. Incubate the tissue suspension at 37 °C for 20 min with gentle agitation (≤ 450 rpm).\nRepeat the trituration through a 1,000 µL pipette tip and incubate for a further 10 min at 37 °C with gentle agitation (≤ 450 rpm).\nPrepare the FACS buffer (PBS supplemented with 10% FCS and 1 mM EDTA) and store on ice. Rinse and soak a stainless-steel screen with a mesh size of 140 µm with FACS buffer in 60 x 15 mm Petri dish on ice.\n\tNOTE: Nylon screen filters should be avoided as it leads to a significant loss in the yield of nucleated cells.\nRepeatedly pass the tissue suspensions through the 140 µm screen filter, as it is held over the Petri dish, with blunt forceps, on ice. Collect the cell suspension from the Petri dish and transfer it to a new 1.5 mL tube stored on ice.",
    "Push any incompletely digested tissue that remains on the filter through by repeated trituration with a 1,000 µL pipette tip. Rinse the screen filter twice with 500 µL of FACS buffer and collect the resulting cell suspension in the Petri dish to combine with the cell suspension from step 3.6.\n\tNOTE: If the flow cytometer used is sensitive to debris, the cell suspension from step 3.7 can be passed through a 70 µm screen filter; however, this may lead to a loss in the yield of nucleated cells.\nCentrifuge the cell suspensions at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of FACS buffer. Repeat this washing step once.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 150-350 µL of FACS buffer, depending upon the number of staining that are required (150 µL FACS buffer per staining panel).\n4. Staining of Sciatic Nerve and DRG with Fluorescently Labeled Antibodies for Flow Cytometry\nTransfer 100 µL of the sciatic nerve or DRG cell suspension into a V-shaped well in a 96-well plate on ice.\n\tNOTE: Single-stained cells are necessary for all antibodies used as they will provide the necessary controls for setting up the flow cytometry with respect to photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltage gains and compensation, as well as to help distinguish specific from non-specific binding. Due to the limited material available from the sciatic nerve and DRGs, blood leukocytes and macrophages from the PCL (steps 1.1-1.2) can be used as the single-stained controls, the staining for which should be performed in parallel with the staining of the sciatic nerve and DRGs.\nPool the remaining cells suspensions (approximately 50 µL per sample) from either the sciatic nerves or DRG samples, to serve as an unstained control.",
    "Centrifuge the plate at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant by inverting the plate over a bin and applying a sharp flick of the wrist, and gently tap dry on paper towels.\nFor surface staining, resuspend each of the cell pellets in 20 µL of FACS buffer containing the antibodies of interest (CD45-A647, CD11b-PerCP/Cy5.5, and MHC Class II-Biotin) and incubate, protected from light, on ice for 30 min.\n\tNOTE: (1) The optimal antibody dilution should be determined prior to use by performing a dilution series according to the manufacturer's product information; (2) Non-specific stainings can be reduced by incubation with Fc-block at this step, according to the manufacturer's instructions; and (3) Isotype control stainings are generally not required when using primary antibodies directly conjugated with a fluorophore and/or when the antigen(s) of interest produce distinct populations.\nAdd 130 µL of FACS buffer to each well and centrifuge the plate at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant as previously described (step 4.3) and wash the cell pellets twice with 150 µL of FACS buffer.\n\tNOTE: If using an unconjugated primary antibody or a primary antibody conjugated to biotin, then an appropriate secondary reagent, conjugated to a fluorophore, can be added at this point and steps 4.4-4.5 are repeated. In the case of this protocol, streptavidin-PE/Cy7 or Streptavidin-PerCP was used to detect MHC Class II in combination with CD45-A647/CD11b-PerCP/Cy5.5, or in combination with CD68-APC and F4/80-PE/Cy7, respectively.",
    "For fixation, after the last washing step, resuspend the cell pellets in 100 µL of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4). Incubate the plate on ice for 10 min and then centrifuge at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant as previously described (step 4.3) and wash the cell pellets once with 150 µL of FACS buffer.\n\tCaution: Paraformaldehyde is toxic; wear appropriate protection such as gloves and eyeglasses, etc.\n\tNOTE: Resuspend the cell pellets in 150 µL of FACS buffer and store protected from the light, at 4° C for up to two days. If no intracellular staining is required, then proceed to step 4.11 after centrifuging the plate at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nFor intracellular staining, resuspend the cell pellets in 150 µL of FACS buffer+0.5% detergent, and incubate at room temperature, protected from the light for 15 min. Centrifuge the plate at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant as previously described (step 4.3) and wash the cell pellet once with 150 µL of FACS buffer+0.5 % detergent. Resuspend the cell pellet in 20 µL of FACS buffer+0.5% detergent containing the antibodies of interest (CD68-APC, CD206-PE) and incubate, protected from light, at room temperature for 30 min.\nAdd 130 µL of FACS buffer+0.5% detergent to each well and centrifuge the plate at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant as previously described (step 4.3) and wash the cell pellets twice with 150 µL of FACS buffer+0.5 % detergent.\n\tNOTE: If using an unconjugated primary antibody or a primary antibody conjugated to biotin, then an appropriate secondary reagent, conjugated to a fluorophore, can be added at this point and steps 4.9-4.10 repeated.",
    "Resuspend the cell pellets in 150 µL of FACS buffer+0.5 % detergent and store, protected from the light, at 4 °C for up to two days.\nResuspend the cell pellets with 150 µL FACS buffer+0.5 % detergent supplemented with 5 µg/mL DAPI and incubate for 5 min at room temperature, protected from the light. Centrifuge the plate at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant as previously described (step 4.3).\nResuspend the cell pellets in 150 µL of PBS and transfer to an appropriately labeled FACs tube. Store at room temperature, protected from the light, until ready for analysis.\n\tNOTE: After resuspension in PBS, the cells should be analyzed within hours, since the DAPI will slowly dissociate from the DNA, leading to a loss in signal.\n5. Setup of Flow Cytometry and Running of Samples\nEnsure that the flow cytometer is equipped with the appropriate lasers and/or filter sets to measure the fluorophores used to stain the cells. This can be determined under the default cytometer configuration on the system. In the case of this protocol, cells were analyzed using a flow cytometer equipped with three lasers (405 nm, 488 nm, and 633 nm) allowing for the detection of ≤ 5 fluorophores.\nSelect the appropriate channels for detection of the fluorophores of interest. All fluorescent signals are best detected with logarithmic amplification.\nSelect an appropriate flow rate for the samples. This parameter can vary depending upon the system used and should be determined empirically. In the case of this protocol, a flow rate of MED-to-HI (35-60 µL/min) was used to prevent clogging of the needle.\nSelect the total number of events/cells to be collected per sample. The minimum number of events should be 1,000,000.",
    "Create scatter plots under a global worksheet of the SSC-A versus FSC-A, as well for each fluorophore of interest versus FCS-A. Create a statistical view that will display the number of events and the mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) for the selected fluorophores.\nSet the voltage of the FSC-A and SSC-A channels, such that the smallest cells fit into the lower left 10% of the scatter plot. Determine the background fluorescence and minimum sample fluorescence from the unstained controls from either the sciatic nerves or DRGs. Determine the parent (P1) gate based upon the scatter plot from DAPI-only staining controls.\n\tNOTE: This is not a collection gate, due in part, to the heterogeneous nature of the DAPI+ population in the PNS.\nUsing the FSC scatter plots for each of the fluorophores of interest, adjust the voltages so that the cells of the unstained control fall within the lower quarter of their respective scatter plots. Gates are then created above this region to define those cells that are positive for each of the respective markers/fluorophores. The placement of a gate is confirmed by running of the single-stained control (step 4.1).\n\tNOTE: Compensation for overlapping emission spectra can be performed at this point or applied retrospectively with the appropriate analysis software.\nOnce the flow cytometer has been set up, as described, the samples can be run.\nAfter the run, the remaining sample material can be discarded and the FCS files can be exported for further analysis.\nSubscription Required.
