  "procedures": [
    "Ethics Statement: All procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines set forth by the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\nNote: Mice used during filming are C57BL/6 mice from Jackson, although other rodent strains or species may also be used. When using other strains or species, be aware that anesthesia dosages and injury timeline may vary. It is important to adapt I/R conditions to accommodate strain, species, and experimental variations.\n1. Prepare the Anesthesia Cocktail\nCombine 1.25 ml Ketamine, 0.625 ml Xylazine, 0.375 ml Acepromazine, and 22.75 ml phosphate buffered saline in a 50 ml centrifuge tube.\n\tNOTE: For the remainder of the manuscript, this solution will be referred to as the cocktail.\nFilter the cocktail into a new sterile 50 ml centrifuge tube using a 60 ml syringe and a 0.20 µm filter. Label and date this new tube.\nFully wrap the cocktail tube in aluminum foil to prevent light-induced degradation of the anesthetic. \n\tNOTE: The cocktail may be stored at room temperature and reused until the expiration date of its earliest-expiring ingredient.\n2. Prepare the Anesthesia Booster\nIn a 50 ml centrifuge tube, combine 4 ml Ketamine and 16 ml phosphate buffered saline.\n\tNOTE: This solution will henceforth be referred to as the booster.\nFilter the booster into a new sterile 50 ml centrifuge tube using a 60 ml syringe and a 0.20 µm filter. Label and date this new tube. \n\tNOTE: The booster may be stored at room temperature and reused until the expiration date of its earliest-expiring ingredient.\n3. Prepare the Surgical Suite\nSet the room temperature between 18 °C and 21 °C.\nTurn on the surgery table, and adjust its surface heat to the highest temperature.\nCover all work surfaces with surgical underpads.",
    "Arrange an empty cage or other container on the surgical table to warm.\nArrange a scale and an ear tagger on the worktop.\n4. Prepare the Balanced Salt Solution with Heparin Sodium\nAdd 0.5 ml of heparin sodium to a 500 ml IV bottle of balanced salt solution (HBSS).\nInsert the sharp end of the primary set prepierced Y-site tubing into the bottle of 0.1% heparin sodium.\n5. Set up the IV Pole\nHang the bottle of 0.1% heparin sodium from the IV pole extension, and snap open the air filter cap on the primary set prepierced Y-site tubing.\nElevate the 0.1% heparin sodium bottle to 163 cm (120 mm Hg). Measure the height from the tabletop to the peak of the sodium heparin drip.\nRemove any air bubbles in the IV tubing by manually flicking the primary set prepierced Y-site tubing.\n6. Set up the Sodium Heparin Drip\nConnect the primary set prepierced Y-site tubing to the five-valve manifold.\nConnect 30-gauge ½ inch needles to the five-port manifold using Luer male to Luer male tube fittings.\nInsert each of the 30-gauge ½ inch needles into its own 10-inch segment of 30-gauge tubing.\nUsing hemostats, break the needle tips from new 30-gauge ½ inch needles and insert their blunt ends into the 30-gauge tubing. Sterility or disinfection of the needle tips will be necessary for Step 8.3.\nUsing tape, arrange the 30-gauge tubes with needles such that the tubes connected to the inner ports are positioned on top of the tubes connected to the outer ports. This arrangement will prevent tangling of tubing during anterior chamber cannulation.\nTurn on the 0.1% heparin sodium flow to the five-valve manifold and to each individual port.",
    "Ensure that the 0.1% heparin sodium is flowing strongly for each port. If a port is flowing weakly, replace the port or clear it with air from a sterile syringe.\nAllow the 0.1% heparin sodium to flow for 2 - 3 min to remove air bubbles from the 30-gauge tubes and 5-valve manifold.\nTurn off all the ports on the 5-valve manifold.\n7. Prepare the Mice for Surgery\nBring the mice to the surgical suite. Supply water bottles for each cage in order to prevent animal dehydration during surgery.\nRecord the weight of each mouse.\nInject each mouse intraperitoneally with 0.02 ml cocktail per gram bodyweight.\nTag and record the number of each mouse.\nPlace all the mice into the empty container on the surgery table. Allow 5-10 min for all the mice to achieve deep anesthetization as confirmed by absence of the pedal withdrawal response to toe pinch.\nFor each mouse, administer one drop of Tropicamide into each eye for pupil dilation and short-term lubrication.\nFor each mouse, administer one drop of Proparacaine into each eye for local anesthesia and short-term lubrication.\nArrange the mice in the order of anesthetization so that the first mouse to be anesthetized will be the first mouse to be cannulated.\nAllow approximately 2 min for the eye drops to take effect.\nPrepare straight 4-inch pieces of tape by pulling tightly on the tape. Set aside one piece of tape for each mouse.    \n\tNOTE: Failing to pull tightly on the tape will result in curling of the tape.\n8. Cannulate the Anterior Chamber\nArrange the first mouse under the surgical microscope, and focus the microscope on the preferred cornea.",
    "NOTE: Cannulation may be performed on either eye. Right-hand dominant surgeons may find it easiest to cannulate the left eye, while left-hand dominant surgeons may prefer the right.\nTurn on the first 0.1% heparin sodium port on the five-valve manifold.\nUnder the surgical microscope, use a pair of forceps to gently proptose the eye. Insert the 30-gauge cannula needle into the anterior chamber approximately halfway between the zonule fibers and the apex of the cornea.\n\t\nTake care to avoid scratching or puncturing the iris, lens, or inner corneal surface.\nAvoid penetrating the cornea a second time.\nUsing a gentle twisting motion to overcome friction between the cannula and the cornea, insert the cannula deeply in the anterior chamber.\nUse a strip of tape to secure the 30-gauge tubing to the table. To minimize movement of the inserted cannula, press the 30-gauge tubing against the tabletop while reaching for the tape.\nRecord the start time of the surgery.\nUsing the microscope, verify that no leakage is apparent. If leakage is present, the movement of fluid will be visible near the eye.\nVisually confirm ocular distention by observing that the I/R eye is larger than the contralateral eye. Together, the absence of leakage and the presence of ocular distention demonstrate a successful elevation of intraocular pressure.\nApply hypromellose to both eyes. Hypromellose serves to lubricate the cornea and seal microleaks. Reapply hypromellose as needed (approximately every 30 min) for sustained lubrication.\nRepeat Step 8 until all animals have been cannulated.\n9. Monitor Anesthesia\nUse the toe pinch, visual observation of the whiskers, or visual observation of the tail to verify that each mouse remains anesthetized. Should a mouse demonstrate a pedal withdrawal response, whisker twitching, or tail movement, proceed immediately to Step 9.2.",
    "If a mouse begins to awaken during surgery, lift the tail to inject 0.05 ml booster intraperitoneally into the lower abdomen from behind the mouse. Allow 1 - 2 min for the booster to take effect.\nShould a mouse require additional sedation, repeat Step 9 as necessary.\n10. Remove the Cannula from the Anterior Chamber\nFor each animal, after 90 min have elapsed, gently pull the cannula from the anterior chamber.\nUntape the mouse from the surgical table, taking care not to disturb the cannula tubing of adjacent animals.\nLubricate both eyes with lubricating jelly.\nAs subsequent cannulae are removed, arrange the mice in the empty container on the surgical table to recover from surgery. Do not turn off the heat of the surgical table.\nAllow, at minimum, 2 - 3 hr for recovery on the heated surgical table. Observe the mice frequently until they have fully recovered from the anesthesia.\n11. Clean the Equipment\nDisinfect the cannulae using alcohol wipes. \n\tNOTE: Other methods for disinfection or sterilization, such as autoclaving, may be substituted.\nExpel 0.1% heparin sodium from the 5-valve manifold, 30-gauge needles, 30-gauge tubing, and cannulae using a 60 ml syringe filled with air.\nRinse the 5-valve manifold, 30-gauge needles, 30-gauge tubing, and cannulae using a 60 ml syringe filled with distilled water.\nExpel distilled water from the 5-port manifold, 30-gauge needles, 30-gauge tubing, and cannulae using a 60 ml syringe filled with air.\nAfter disinfecting the cannulae and rinsing the tubing apparatus, store this equipment for reuse.\nStore, discard, or turn off all other equipment. Leave the heat of the surgical table on.\n12. Return All Mice to Their Home Cages",
    "After the mice awaken from surgery (after 2 - 3 hr), return each animal to its home cage. Provide gel food for each cage. Return all cages to their designated rooms.\nTurn off the heat of the surgical table. Discard all waste, and wipe down the surgical suite.\n13. Perform Retinal Assessment\nAs appropriate, collect retinas for histological analysis or dark adapt mice for electroretinogram recording.\nSubscription Required.
