    "1.  Acclimation to Handling for Intranasal Dosing to Awake Mice\nIntroduction\nMice must be acclimated to handling for a period  of two-four weeks before the onset of intranasal dosing. Acclimation to handling is important, as it  helps ensure a correct body position for maximum effectiveness of awake  intranasal drug delivery. In addition, mice  that have not been properly accustomed to this process can have a severe  anxiety reaction after dosing. Mice  should spend about 2-3 days on each of nine steps before progressing to the  next step, depending upon the animal's comfort to handling. The mouse's stress level should be used as a  measure of progress. This means  monitoring the mouse's movements, the amount/frequency of urination,  defecation, trembling, and biting. If a  mouse has a high stress response, stay on that step before progressing to the  next until the response is reduced. A  sample acclimation schedule can be seen in Table 1. Acclimation of the mice should progress  through the following once-a-day steps. Performing these steps more than once  per day, in an attempt to accelerate the acclimation, is not recommended.\nPlace the mouse in the palm of the hand for a  period of two to three minutes, no more than one foot above the cage top, as  animals frequently jump during this introductory step. If the mouse attempts to crawl out of the hand  and up one's arm, simply lift the mouse by the base of the tail and place it  back in one's hand.\nPlace the mouse in the palm of the hand for  three minutes and pet the animal gently. Pet the mouse directionally from the head to  the tail, while allowing the animal to move about freely.",
    "Place the mouse in the palm of the hand for  three minutes while massaging behind the ears (lightly pinching together the  skin on the back of the neck using the thumb and pointer finger).\nHold/lift the mouse by the scruff of its neck  for 30 sec, letting the mouse rest on the cage top for 30 sec before repeating  the hold again.\nHold the mouse using the intranasal grip, which  is described in section 2, but do not invert the animal (complete up to step  2.4). Hold the animal like this for a  period of 30 sec and release back to the cage top. Repeat a second time after a one-minute rest period.\nHold the mouse with the intranasal grip as  described in section 2, including inverting the animal so its ventral side is  facing up towards the ceiling. Make sure  that the animal's neck is parallel to the floor. Hold this position for 30 sec. Repeat this  a second time after a one-minute rest period. Some mice will resist the  intranasal grip more than others, especially when used for the first time with  inversion at this step in the acclimation.  If the mouse frees itself from the grip, put the mouse back on the cage  top and re-grip. Repeat the re-grip if  needed, but monitor the stress level of the mouse and return it to the cage if  necessary. Another factor that can play  a role in losing the grip at this point in the acclimation process is  inexperience of the animal handlers with the intranasal delivery technique.\nHold the mouse with the intranasal grip, invert,  briefly place a pipettor with an empty tip over each nostril, and hold the  animals position for 30 sec. Repeat  this after a one-minute rest period.",
    "Hold the mouse  with the intranasal grip,  invert it, and intranasally administer 6  μl of saline into the left and right  nare as described in section 3 (through step 3.7).\nHold the mouse with the intranasal grip, invert  it, and intranasally administer 6  μl of saline into the left and right nare  twice placing the animal back on the cage top in between, as described in  section 3.\n2.  The Intranasal Grip to Immobilize Awake Mice\nPlace the mouse on the cage top. \nWith the thumb and index finger of your dominant  hand, hold the mouse by the tail. Using  your middle, ring, and pinky fingers, lightly pin the lower portion of the body  to the cage top (Figure 1A). Let the mouse grab onto the bars as you lightly stretch  the mouse out and better grab the scruff.\nUsing the thumb and middle finger on your  non-dominant hand, pinch the mouse firmly at the scruff (excess skin) behind  the neck and shoulders. Pull up on the  loose skin to make a tent of skin across the shoulder blades (Figure 1B). Take as much skin as possible, but be careful  not to pull up muscle as this will cause discomfort to the mouse. Exercise caution so as not to apply too much  pressure to the animal's ribcage or spine. Excessive pressure or pulling of the skin may  lead to inhibition of respiration in some cases.\nQuickly place the index finger of your  non-dominant hand on the mouse's head as close to the nose as possible and pull  back on the skin (Figure 1C, 1D). At the  same time, slide the thumb and middle fingers toward the head for optimal  position. Ideally, the mouse should not  be able to move its head vertically or horizontally.",
    "While maintaining the grip on the scruff, turn  the mouse onto his back. The mouse's  back should be in the palm of your hand.  Firmly hold the mouse's tail (near the base) against your palm with your  last two fingers (ring and pinky) to stabilize the mouse, or you may wrap your  fingers across the lower body (Figure 1E, 1F).\nAt this point make sure that the mouse's neck  and chin are flat and parallel to the floor. The chin should be close to a 180 degree angle  with the neck as much as possible to assist with intranasal delivery. Slight changes in angle can cause the drug to  end up in the wrong site. Make sure the  mouse is able to breathe by watching the abdomen. The mouse should not be able to move, but  should be comfortable and not in any pain.  If you see the mouse's neck and chin making a \"V\", then you need to  re-grip. \n3.  Intranasal Delivery of Drug to Awake Mice\nIntroduction",
    "Using the intranasal grip, each mouse is  restrained twice and held with their neck parallel to the floor while a volume  of 20-30  μl of liquid is administered. This  volume is safe and efficacious for small-large mice; we typically use 24  μl,  and that is described in this protocol. The  awake intranasal method can be used in mice of any age, for example in newborn  mice for developmental neuroscience research.  In newborn mice, a smaller total volume (8  μl) and droplet size (1  μl)  should be used to accommodate the smaller volume of the nasal cavity. Drug is typically delivered to two mice at a  time, alternating rest periods to make the most efficient use of time and keep  on schedule. Set-up will be a little  different depending on if you are dosing group housed mice or individually  housed mice. With the individually  housed mice, it is helpful to place all of your materials in between the cages  to prevent mice from crossing over to the other cage top. With the group-housed mice, dose from that  cage only. It is important that each  mouse in a group-housed cage receives the same intranasal treatment, as  potential for cross contamination of two different treatments exists due to  drug expelling into the air or with skin contact. It is highly  recommended that a dosing sheet be printed in advance, to remind technicians of  treatment assignments, to record any notes of missed drops, to note general  health of each animal, etc.\nSteps\nSet up cages where they should be for dosing,  and set up a dosing station (Figure 2).\nRemove mouse from cage and keep on cage top  during dosing.\nPick up the mouse using the intranasal grip  described in section 2.",
    "Using your dominant hand, load the pipettor with  6  μl of drug or vehicle. Place the tip  of the filled pipettor near the mouse's left nostril, usually at a 45 degree  angle (Figure 1G, 1H). If you have a  viscous solution you may need to increase your angle to 90 degrees because the  drug may run up the side of the pipette tip instead of making a drop. If very viscous, wiping the pipette tip with  a tissue before expelling liquid may help.  Slowly eject the drug to form a small droplet with about half of the  volume (3 μl).\nThe droplet should be placed close enough to the  mouse's nostril so that the mouse can inhale the droplet. Immediately after the mouse inhales this  small drop, eject the rest of the drug in the pipette tip to form another small  droplet for the mouse to inhale through the same nostril about 2-3 sec  later. Be sure to watch the mouth. If there is any liquid in the mouth, the drop  did not make it fully into the nose and this should be noted.\nHold the mouse in this position for 15 sec. It is highly recommended that a timer be used  to standardize this 15 sec hold.\nRepeat steps 3.3 - 3.6 for the right  nostril. If any drops are snorted out,  that drop should be replaced and noted.\nPlace the mouse back on top of his cage for 2 min. Repeat the entire process starting  2 min. after delivery of the first drop.  This gives the mouse four drops of 6  μl each totaling 24  μl of solution. A sample schedule for dosing one or two mice  at once can be seen in Table 2.\nAfter the mouse has received all drops, return  the mouse to its cage.",
    "4.  General Animal Handling Techniques for Acclimation and Intranasal Delivery of Drug to Awake Mice\nAfter each acclimation or intranasal dosing session,  mice should be given a treat, such as a Cheerio or peeled sunflower seed as  positive reinforcement. Treats are given  as a reward and to distract them from scratching their noses, potentially  causing injury to themselves. When working with group housed mice, enough treats  should be dropped for each mouse. Before  returning animals to their cages be sure to restore nests to their original  states in order to reduce stress. When  dosing group housed animals, gloves must be changed between dosing of cages so  as not to transfer scent from cage colony to cage colony, as they will become  aggressive towards one another.Subscription Required.
