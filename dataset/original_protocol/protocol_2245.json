Keep the mixture on ice. Different concentrations of fibrinogen form matrices with different stiffness (Liu et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Tan et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). The formula of some frequently-used and stiffness calibrated fibrin gels is shown in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1852_8.csv\nCell seeding in 3D fibrin gels.\nAdd 5 μL thrombin (0.1 U/μL) to the center of each well (24-well plate).\n250 μL mixture of the fibrinogen and cell solution is seeded immediately into each well.\nPut the 24-well cell culture plate for 30 min in a 37°C incubator with 5% CO2 until fibrin gel polymerization. The visual workflow of fibrin gels generation is shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1852-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. The operation flow of fibrin gels generation in a 24-well plate\nAdd 1mL medium to each well, and put it back into the 5% CO2 incubator.\nCarefully remove the old culture medium every two days, and add 1 mL of fresh medium into each well. Tilt the plate slightly during the liquid change to prevent the pipette from disturbing the gels.\nNote: Do not allow the gel to wrinkle when mixing fibrinogen and cell solution mixture with thrombin. It is recommended to place the culture plates on ice throughout the process on the premise of ensuring an aseptic operation. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nNote: HCT116 cells form smooth and proliferating colonies in 90-Pa 3D fibrin gels (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). With the increase of gel stiffness, the colony shape becomes smoother, but the growth rate decreases gradually. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].",
    "Live 3D colony growth monitoring\nTiming: 6 days\nColony size and circularity analysis.\nSeed 5000 cells into 3D fibrin gels per well in a 24-well plate. Two repeats for each condition.\nCapture at least 15 colony images for each condition every two days with a regular widefield microscope.\nAnalyze Colony size or circularity quantitatively by image J software. Draw the growth curve of colonies based on the measured size or circularity across time.\nColony numbers analysis.\nCulture 500 cells into 3D fibrin gels per well in a 96-well plate for each condition. Three repeats for each condition. Count the numbers of round colonies in the wells under the microscope every two days.\nDraw the growth curve based on the colony numbers across time.\nNote: Culture plates of 3D fibrin gels should be selected according to the specific needs of experiments. The cell numbers seeded in 3D fibrin gels are variable. Make sure that there is still space between colonies after 6 days of culturing without touching each other. The formula of reagents and cell concentrations in different plates is shown in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\nNote: For the experiments that need to detect the colony growth after cell transfection, direct transfection in a 3D fibrin gel system is not recommended, as it is difficult for Lipofectamine to reach cells or colonies through fibrin gel pores. It is recommended to transfect cells before 3D fibrin gels generation.\nNote: Capture colony images randomly rather than selectively, and note that the completely spreading tumor cells tend to be differentiated which may not have tumorigenic potential.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1852_9.csv\n3D cultured cell isolation\nTiming: 1h",
    "3D cultured colonies or single cells need to be extracted from fibrin gels for subsequent mechanotransductive study. 3D cultured colonies can be used for qPCR and western blotting, while 3D cultured singles cells can be used for immunofluorescence staining(IF), atomic force microscope (AFM) measurement, and flow cytometry.\nFibrin gel degradation.\nTake out a Dispase II stock (100 mg/mL) and melt it on the ice. Dilute it to 2mg/mL with PBS.\nTake a 24-well plate with fibrin gels and colonies out from the incubator. Remove culture medium and wash with PBS once.\nDiscard PBS and add 200 μL of Dispase II solution into each well.\nIncubate the matrix at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 5–15 min.\nAfter gel degradation, collect the solution to a 15 mL centrifugal tube and centrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min to obtain the colonies, which could be used for qPCR, western blotting, and other experiments that do not require single cells.\nColony dissociation.\nDisperse the colony pellet in step 5.d with 1 mL of TrypLE. Place the tube in a 37°C water bath.\nDisperse the cell mass every 5 min and observe the degree of colony dissociation under the microscope.\nWhen it is observed that the colonies are completely dissociated into single cells, add the culture medium to terminate the digestion. Harvest single cells after centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min. Troubleshooting 4.[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]\nSingle cells can be counted for injection of mice experiments or flow cytometry, or replated onto dishes for high-resolution analysis including single-cell imaging or AFM measurement.",
    "Note: It usually takes 15–20 min to dissociate colorectal colonies into single cells. The whole colonies or single cells harvest process should be controlled within 1 hour, as the physical environment has been altered once fibrin gels degrade. The properties of 3D fibrin gels selected colonies or cells may change due to their plasticity when placed in a tube or rigid plastic well for a long time.\n3D cultured cell fixation for fluorescence imaging\nTiming: 3 days\nParaformaldehyde fixation.\nSeed 5000 cells into 3D fibrin gels on a glass-bottom dish according to the reagent amounts shown in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\nAfter 2–6 days of culturing, carefully aspirate the culture medium and wash with PBS once.\nAdd 1 mL 4% Paraformaldehyde to each dish and shake at 25°C–27°C for 10 min.\nWash with PBST (0.05% Triton-X in PBS) on a shaker for 20 min three times.\nPause point: After fixation, the glass bottom dishes with gels and colonies covered with PBS can be stored at 4°C for two weeks.\nImmunofluorescence.\nRemove PBST and add 500 μL Normal Donkey Serum (blocking serum) to each dish. Block for at least 5 h at 4°C.\nPrepare 100–200 μL of primary antibody solution diluted with blocking serum for each glass-bottom dish, and the dilution ratio of primary antibody is about 1:50 to 1:100.\nAfter blocking, remove the blocking buffer and add 100–200 μL primary antibody solution to the center of the glass-bottom dish. Incubate the antibody at 4°C for 5–12 h.\nRemove primary antibody and wash with PBST on a shaker for 20 min three times.\nRepeat step 8. a and prepare 500 μL of second antibody solution diluted with blocking serum for each glass-bottom dish, and the dilution ratio of the second antibody is 1:1000.",
    "After blocking, remove the blocking buffer and add 500 μL s antibody solution to the center of the glass-bottom dish. Incubate at 25–27°C and protect from light for 2 h.\nRemove the second antibody and wash with PBST on a shaker for 20 min three times. The dishes are ready for imaging.\nAlternatives: When using dyes such as fluorescent labeled phalloidin or DAPI for fluorescent staining, dye solution can be directly added for staining (skip 8a to g). After 30 min staining, imaging can be carried out after PBST washing for 20 min three times.\nNote: During fluorescence imaging, try to focus on the colonies in the middle of the gels instead of those on the bottom. Because colonies on the bottom of gels directly contact the rigid glass of the dish, its properties are different from the tumorigenic cells.\nPreparation of PA gels and cell seeding\nTiming: 3 days\nPreparation of activated glass-bottom dishes.\nAdd 200 μL 0.1 N NaOH with a pipette to the glass bottom dishes (35 mm with 20 mm glass-bottom well) and air-dry for 10–16 h.\nSmear 100–200 μL of 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane evenly on the glass bottom dishes with a sterile q-tip for 6 min.\nRinse with ddH2O on a shaker for 15 min twice with gentle agitation.\nCover the glass with 0.5% glutaraldehyde and incubate at 25°C–27°C for 1h.\nRemove the glutaraldehyde, rinse with ddH2O for 15 min twice and remove the ddH2O by aspiration and UV treated Kimwipe paper. The activation steps of glass-bottom dishes have been completed (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1852-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Glass-bottom dishes activation\nCritical: NaOH, 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, and glutaraldehyde are harmful to health. Wear protective gear and operate safely.\nPause point: Activated glass bottom dishes can be stored for 48 h at 25°C–27°C or 2 weeks at 4°C.\nPreparation of polyacrylamide Solution.",
    "The gel precursor solution is mixed from 40% acrylamide solution and 2% bis-acrylamide solution in ddH2O, and gels can be polymerized by adding 1/200 volume of 10% APS and 1/2000 volume of TEMED to the precursor solution. PA gels stiffness is controlled by varying amounts of 40% acrylamide and 2% bis-acrylamide solutions (Engler et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Yeung et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Wang and Pelham, 1998[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] shows the formula of PA gels with different stiffness.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1852_10.csv\nImmediately add 40 μL of the precursor solution onto the preactivated glass-bottom dishes and cover with an 18 mm coverslip.\nPut inverted dishes 30–40min in a 37°C incubator for acrylamide polymerizing. The time can be adjusted according to the gel stiffness to make sure the polymerization is complete.\nAdd 2 mL 100 mM HEPES to dishes and remove the coverslip gently using forceps.\nWash the gel with 100 mM HEPES on a shaker for 15 min twice.\nCritical: Acrylamide, bis-acrylamide, and APS are harmful to health. Wear protective gear and operate safely.\nNote: When preparing the PA gel precursor solution, it is recommended to add reagents in this order: ddH2O → 40% acrylamide solution → 2% bis-acrylamide solution → 10% APS → TEMED. The process of PA gels preparation is shown schematically in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9].\nPause point: The gels submerged in HEPES could be stored for 2 weeks at 4°C.\nNote: HCT116 cells show a tendency of spheroidization on the softer PA gels (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]), which is consistent with our previous finding that soft matrix contributes to the stemness of colorectal cancer cells (Chang et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nCollagen type I coating on PA gel surface.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1852-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. PA gels generation",
    "Prepare 700 μL Sulfo-SANPAH working solution for each dish by diluting 1 part of 5 mg/mL stock solution with 99 parts of HEPES.\nRemove HEPES from the dishes containing gels and add 350 μL Sulfo-SANPAH working solution. Place gels under UV light for 6 min. Ensure that the distance between UV light and PA gels does not exceed 6 cm.\nRemove the darkened Sulfo-SANPAH solution and wash with 100 mM HEPES on a shaker for 10 min twice in dark.\nRepeat step 11. b and c.\nPrepare 350 μL of collagen type I (200 μg/mL) for each dish by diluting the appropriate amount of collagen type I in PBS.\nRemove HEPES and incubate with 200 μL 200 μg/mL of collagen type I or fibrinogen at 4°C for 10–16 h.\nWash the gels with PBS carefully. The PA gels coated with Collagen type I are ready for cell seeding and can be stored for 2–3 weeks at 4°C submerged in PBS. The process of gel coating is shown schematically in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1852-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Collagen type I coating and cell seeding on PA gel\nNote: Prepare fresh Sulfo-SANPAH working solution before use. Make sure the gels are fully covered with Sulfo-SANPAH. Remove liquids carefully and avoid touching the gels. The gels submerged in PBS can be stored at 4°C for 2 weeks.\nCell seeding.\nSterilize the gels under UV light for at least 30 min. Remove PBS and add cell culture medium to gels. Place gels in a 37°C incubator with 5% CO2 for 35–45 min.\nSeed cancer cells onto the PA gels with an appropriate density. Generally, the cells should reach 70% confluence within 2 days. Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.11].\nPA gels cultured cell harvesting\nTiming: 1h\nCell digestion.",
    "Culture cells on PA gels for 24–72 h. Remove the culture medium. Troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.13].\nWash the dishes with PBS and digest the cells from PA gels with 500 μL TrypLE for each dish.\nCollect PA gels cultured cells by centrifugation at 200 × g for 3 min.\nNote: The cells digested from PA gels can be used for most molecular biology experiments. For the single-cell experiment of measuring cell rigidity by atomic force microscope (AFM), it is recommended to replant the single cell on the surface of the glass bottom dish without gels. And the AFM measurement should be finished within 30 min for each dish in case of changes of cells seeded on glass."
