    "1. Removable PDMS-based Interconnector for Low-pressure Microfluidic Applications15-16\nPreparation\n\tThis section describes different steps to prepare the glass and PDMS in order to produce the interconnector.\n\t\nPrepare the PDMS: Mix the PDMS and curing agent with (10:1) ratio.\nEnsure that the oven temperature is stabilized at a constant temperature of 80 °C. Depending on the oven, use a measurement device to sense the temperature of the oven and then manually monitor it.\nThoroughly clean the Petri dish with ethanol.\nClean the surface of the microfluidic access holes where the PDMS interconnector will be placed.\nFabrication\n\tThe interconnector described in this paper is essentially a compliant gasket. This gasket is formed from PDMS and contains holes into which microtubes may be inserted. It self-adheres to the surface of a microfluidic chip, to form a leak-proof seal between the microtube and access holes to microchannels in the chip.\n\tUse the following steps to fabricate the interconnector.\n\t\nPour a thin layer (approximately 2 mm) of the PDMS (liquid) into a Petri dish.\nLet the PDMS slightly polymerize at a temperature of 80 °C in the oven for 12-15 min. Place the microfluidic chip to which the connection will be made in the oven at the same time, so that it will be at the same temperature.\nWhen the PDMS starts to polymerize, remove it from the curing oven.\nUse a biopsy punch to form holes of the desired diameter in the microfluidic chip surface.\nUsing the blade, cut the required piece of PDMS.",
    "Note: It is recommended to initially cut out a larger piece of material than that will eventually be required. To avoid using multiple connectors, it is desirable that any given PDMS interconnector be cut to a square shape, and holes punched, so as to conform to the maximum possible number of holes on the user's chip.\nKeep the holes slightly smaller than the outside diameter of the microtube.\nQuickly remove the PDMS from the Petri dishes and place it onto the microfluidic chip.\nEnsure that there is no dust on either the PDMS or chip and ensure that the access holes on the microfluidic chip are aligned with those of PDMS.\nUsing a micropositioner, insert tubes (e.g. Teflon tubes) through the PDMS interconnector. The tubes should be 110% of microfluidic access hole diameter to prevent liquid leakage. The same tubes can be connected to the liquid injection system depending on the user's application.\nNote: Always place the tubes using a micropositioner, the PDMS layer is not very thick and can be detached if the tubes are twisted.\nIf necessary, add epoxy between the tube and the PDMS for better adherence.\n\t\tAn example of the completed interconnector is shown in the figures and in Ghallab and Badawy2.\n2. Interconnecting Microtubes in Microfluidic Applications with Epoxy17 \nWhen fabricating an interconnector, ensure the edge of the microtube is correctly cut. Use a new sharp blade to cut the edge of the microtube straight and to ensure that the contact between microtubes and access hole is uniform.\nUsing the micropositioner, carefully place the microtube in the access hole of the microfluidic chip.\nApply a small pressure on the epoxy dispenser to deposit epoxy on the access holes or manually place it.\nAllow the epoxy to cure using the following steps:",
    "UV curable Epoxy: Expose the UV epoxy to a UV source for 3-10 min, depending on the quantity of the epoxy used. For more details, refer to the epoxy specifications.\nStandard epoxy: If the microfluidic substrate is to be used only at RT, keep epoxy curing during 24 hr at RT. If the substrate is required to withstand high temperatures, rapidly solidify the epoxy by exposing it to 100 °C using an oven or a heater, depending on the application. For more details, refer to the epoxy specifications.\n3. Assembly Technique for Reusable Microfluidic Chips with Electrical Interface17\nAssembling the Components\nFigure 2 shows the links between the electrical connectors on the PCB and the electrical pads on the microfluidic chip. To assemble the PCB/microfluidic chip/Plexiglas components, follow these steps:\nCAUTION: Avoid excessive compression pressure, which can break the microfluidic chip.\n\t\nSolder the surface-mount multipin electrical connectors to the PCB.\nIf there is surface contamination on the microfluidic chip's electrical pads, clean with plasma oxygen; otherwise clean the pads with ethanol.\nUse a sharp blade to cut the conductive tape into small pieces with the same dimensions as the microfluidic chip's electrical pads, as shown in Figures 1 and 2.\nUsing forceps, place the conductive tape on the PCB electrical pads.\nAlign and then place the microfluidic chip onto the PCB.\nNote: For placement precision, use an alignment machine.\nPlace an insulation layer (such as paper) on the PCB to avoid short circuits before installing the metal brackets, depending on the location of the PCB traces.\nAttach the metal bracket using machine screws and nuts.\nDisassembling\nRemove the machine screws, nuts and the metal brackets.\nGently separate the microfluidic chip and the PCB.",
