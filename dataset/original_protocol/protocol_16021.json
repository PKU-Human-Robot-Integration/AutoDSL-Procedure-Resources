    "The protocol describes the QIAseq single cell procedure for WGA from single cells, or very small quantities of purified genomic DNA using MDA. The reaction is facilitated by an optimized phi29 polymerase together with an optimized buffer composition. All reagents used in the MDA reaction are provided with the QIAseq single cell DNA library kit and are specially treated to eliminate contaminating DNA, which is critical to achieve reliable results in single cell or ultra-low input applications.\nThis protocol is optimized for single cells without a cell wall from eukaryotic species, for example, mammalian sorted cells or plant protoplasts, micro dissected cells from frozen sections, and tissue cultured cells, as well as for nuclei and gram-positive bacteria. Cells that are treated with formalin or other cross-linking agents cannot be amplified by this method.\nAn input of 1 to 1,000 intact cells (e.g., human or bacterial cells) or purified DNA >6 pg is optimal for WGA reactions. Caution is required when working with purified eukaryotic DNA; in order to achieve complete genome coverage input, >1 ng is required to compensate DNA losses during the purification. Before starting with the WGA, carefully decontaminate the workbench with nucleic acid and nuclease eliminating agents. To avoid any DNA contamination of reagents, use separate laboratory equipment (e.g., pipets, filter pipet tips, reaction vials). It is recommended that the WGA reaction be set up in a location that minimizes the possibility of exogenous DNA contamination. Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.753#cpz1753-fig-0001] illustrates the workflow of the whole genome amplification. This starts with the cell lysis and DNA denaturation under mild alkaline conditions, followed by neutralization and by isothermal multiple displacement amplification using Phi29 polymerase. All these steps take place in one single tube by sequential addition of the corresponding reagents.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/bbd68d4a-8a7e-4548-9a78-8121804d4bf4/cpz1753-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1",

    "Reconstituted Buffer DLB can be stored at –20°C for up to 6 months. Longer storage than 6 months is not recommended because buffer DLB is pH labile.\n5. Prepare sufficient Buffer D2 (denaturation buffer; Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.753#cpz1753-tbl-0002]) and DTT dilution (Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.753#cpz1753-tbl-0003]) for the total number of whole genome amplification reactions.\nThe tables represent the volumes needed for twelve reactions with 10% overfill to avoid any loss of material due to pipetting errors. If more samples will be processed in parallel, scale up accordingly. If performing fewer reactions, store residual Buffer D2 at –20°C.\nBuffer D2 should not be stored for longer than 3 months.\nDTT dilutions should be freshly prepared and directly used.\nTable 2.\n                Preparation of D2 Buffer\ntable:\n﻿Component,Volume for 12 reactions (plus 10%)\n\"DTT, 1M\",3.3 µl\nBuffer DLB,36.3 µl\nTable 3.\n                Preparation of DTT 1/10 Dilution\ntable:\n﻿Component,Volume for 12 reactions (plus 10%)\n\"DTT, 1M\",3.3 µl\nH2O,29.7 µl\n6.

If using <4 µl of cell material or DNA, add PBS sc to bring the volume to 4 µl.\nSort the cells directly in the PCR tubes or plates, which will be used for the MDA reaction. If cell-dispensing volume is <4 µl, prefill tubes with the appropriate volume of PBS sc to obtain the final volume of 4 µl. Do not sort the cells in D2 buffer because excessive incubation of cells and DNA in this buffer will decrease the integrity of DNA. Avoid any pipetting steps of single cells after sorting and before MDA. Mix reactions containing single cells by gently flicking the tube, to avoid losing the cell on a pipet tip.\n7. Add 3 µl Buffer D2. Mix carefully by gently flicking the tube and centrifuge briefly.",
    "Avoid any contact of cell material and the reaction tube or pipet tips and ensure that the cell material does not stick to the tube wall above the buffer line because this will lead to material loss. Also, ensure mixing of D2 buffer with cell material is complete. Insufficient mixing will lead to insufficient lysis of the cells and loss of material that can be amplified.\n8. Place tube in the thermal cycler and run protocol “cell lysis & DNA denaturation” or “denaturation of purified DNA” (Table 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.753#cpz1753-tbl-0004]) depending on the starting material.\nTable 4.\n                Cell Lysis and DNA Denaturation Protocol\ntable:\n﻿Cell lysis and DNA denaturation,Cell lysis and DNA denaturation,Denaturation of purified DNA,Denaturation of purified DNA\nTime,Temperature,Time,Temperature\n10 min,65°C,3 min,25°C\n1 min,4°C,1 min,4°C\n9.

Thaw REPLI-g sc DNA Polymerase on ice. Thaw all other components at room temperature, vortex, and then centrifuge briefly. The REPLI-g sc Dilution Buffer may form a precipitate after thawing. The precipitate will dissolve by vortexing for ∼10 s.\n11. Prepare a master mix by adding components in the order listed in Table 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.753#cpz1753-tbl-0005]. Then mix and centrifuge briefly. Briefly vortex and centrifuge the mixture of buffer, H2O sc, DTT, and oligos before adding REPLI-g sc DNA polymerase. The master mix should be kept on ice and used immediately upon addition of REPLI-g sc DNA polymerase.\nTable 5.\n                Preparation of REPLI-g Master Mix\ntable:\n﻿Component,Volume per reaction,Volume for 12 reactions (plus 10%)\nH2O sc,6.5 µl,85.8 µl\nREPLI-g sc Dilution Buffer,14.5 µl,191.4 µl\nREPLI-g sc universal oligo or REPLI-g sc advanced oligo,14.5 µl,191.4 µl\nDTT (1:10),2.5 µl,33 µl\nREPLI-g sc DNA polymerase,2 µl,26.4 µl",
    "12. For each reaction, add 40 µl master mix to 10 µl denatured DNA (from step 10).\n13. Place tube in the thermal cycler and run the protocol “Cycling conditions of MDA” listed in Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.753#cpz1753-tbl-0001].\nIf not directly used, store amplified DNA at 4°C for short-term storage (2-4 weeks) or –20°C for long-term storage (>4 weeks). WGA-DNA should be treated as genomic DNA with minimal freeze-thaw cycles. We recommend storage of nucleic acids at a concentration of at least 100 ng/µl.\nTypical DNA yields are 20-40 µg per 50 µl reaction, depending on the starting material, and need to be diluted before quantification by adding 1× volume of H2O sc. Optical density (OD) measurements overestimate REPLI-g amplified DNA. Therefore PicoGreen™ quantification, as described in Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.753#cpz1753-prot-0002], is recommended.\nDNA yields of 3-20 µg may be present in negative (no-template) controls if incubating for a longer time than 3 hr because DNA is generated during the REPLI-g single cell reaction by random extension of primer-dimers. This does not contain genetic information and will not affect the quality of downstream applications. These products are outcompeted by high integrity DNA present during WGA. DNA yields may contain amplification products from contaminating environmental DNA. It is important to maintain a nucleic acid free working environment.",
    "This protocol is designed for quantification of double stranded REPLI-g amplified DNA using PicoGreen reagent. PicoGreen quantification is recommended if a high number of samples must be quantified at once. For single probes, use the Qubit dsDNA BR assay kits.\nNOTE: Alternatively, Qubit quantification can also be performed according to manufacturer's protocol using Qubit dsDNA HS and BR assay kits depending on the expected concentration range (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. Q33230, Q32850, or Q33265).\nCAUTION: Always wear a suitable lab coat, disposable gloves, and protective goggles when working with hazardous chemicals, and consult the appropriate material SDSs, available from the product supplier, before starting with the protocol.\nMaterials\nQuant-iT™ PicoGreen™ dsDNA reagent (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no.

Make a 1/150 dilution of PicoGreen stock solution in TE buffer, in a 2-ml microcentrifuge tube. Each quantification reaction requires 20 µl. Cover the microcentrifuge tube in aluminum foil or place it in the dark to avoid photodegradation of the PicoGreen reagent. Prepare the PicoGreen/TE solution in a plastic container as the PicoGreen reagent may adsorb onto glass surfaces.\nExample: To prepare enough PicoGreen working solution for 100 samples, add 13.3 µl PicoGreen to 1,986.7 µl TE buffer.\n2.

Place 2 µl of each MDA amplified DNA sample (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.753#cpz1753-prot-0001], step 14) for quantification into a new 96-well plate and add 198 µl TE buffer to make a 1/100 dilution. Store the remaining MDA amplified DNA at –20°C. The 1/100 dilutions can also be stored at –20°C and used for future downstream sample analysis.\n6. Place 2 µl diluted MDA DNA (from step 5) into an unused well of 96-well plate A and add 18 µl TE to make a 1/1000 dilution.\n7. Add 20 µl PicoGreen working solution (from step 1) to each sample (amplified DNA and DNA standards) in 96-well plate A. Gently shake the plate on the bench top to mix the samples and reagent.\n8. Centrifuge the 96-well plate 10 s to collect residual liquid from the walls of the wells.\n9. Measure sample fluorescence using a fluorescence microplate reader and standard fluorescence filters (excitation 480 nm; emission ∼520 nm).\nTo ensure that the sample readings remain in the detection range of the microplate reader, adjust the instrument's gain so that the sample with the highest DNA concentration yields fluorescence intensity near, but not exceeding, the fluorometer's maximum.\n10. To calculate DNA concentration, generate a standard curve by plotting the concentration of DNA standards (µg/ml; x axis) against the fluorescence reading generated by the microplate reader (y axis). Plot an average of the fluorescence recorded for each DNA standard of the same concentration.",
    "11. Use the standard curve to determine the concentration (µg/ml) of the diluted REPLI-g amplified DNA sample. This is achieved by plotting the fluorescence reading of the sample against the standard curve and reading the DNA concentration on the x axis.\n12. The calculation of DNA concentration depends on the standard curve and the determination of the slope. For accurate results, the standard curve should be a straight line. Any deviation from this may cause inaccuracies in the measurement of REPLI-g amplified DNA concentrations.\n13. Multiply the value determined in step 11 by 1,000 to show the concentration of undiluted sample DNA (because the sample DNA measured by PicoGreen fluorescence had been diluted 1 in 1000).\n14. To determine the total amount of DNA in the sample, multiply the concentration of undiluted sample DNA (µg/ml; determined in step 13) by the reaction volume in milliliters (i.e., for a 50-µl reaction, multiply by 0.05).",

Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.753#cpz1753-fig-0003] illustrates the steps involved in the whole transcriptome amplification. These are cell lysis, RNA denaturation, genomic DNA removal, followed by reverse transcription of mRNA or total RNA, cDNA ligation, and finally isothermal multiple displacement amplification of the ligated cDNA. The procedure results in sufficient yields of amplified cDNA and is suited for multiple applications, such as next-generation sequencing (RNA-Seq), real-time PCR, and microarray analysis. In a single reaction it can process 1 to 1,000 cells from all vertebrate species (e.g., human, mouse, rat, micromanipulated and sorted cells, or tissue culture cells). The protocol cannot be used for any cells with a cell wall, e.g., bacterial cells or plant cells. The protocol cannot process fixed cells that are treated with formalin or other cross-linking agents.

    "This protocol is for enrichment of complete small genomes, e.g., mitochondrial genome or viral DNA in a high genomic DNA background. The protocol replaces the random oligonucleotides by a few target-specific primers in the MDA amplification to specifically enrich viral DNA and other small genomes in the presence of a high host DNA background. This protocol allows enrichment of mitochondrial genome or viral DNA starting from 105 copies out of 500 pg to 10 ng of purified genomic eukaryotic DNA template.\nSpecific primers for the enrichment of small genomes can be designed using open-source online primer design tools, e.g., Primer3 (https://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/[href=https://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/]) or Primer-BLAST (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/[href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/]). Primer-Blast includes the additional feature of specificity checking. With this option enabled, the program will align the primers against a selected database. Based on their matches to putative non-specific targets and their orientations, it will determine whether a primer pair can generate an amplification product on any unwanted targets in this database. The program will return a collection of primers that do not generate a valid PCR product on unintended sequences and are therefore specific to the intended template.\nFor design parameters, it is recommended that Tm of primers is set to 34°C to 40°C and length to between 17 and 21 bp. Amplicon length should be 300 to 4,000 bp.

    "This protocol is for the normalization of NGS libraries compatible with Illumina platforms using the QIAseq Library Normalizer Kit and is optional. The protocol eliminates the need of quantifying libraries individually. When processing multiple libraries in parallel, it accelerates the procedure of pooling the libraries, without the need of a reagent and time consuming quantification. The used magnetic beads bind and release a specific amount of library in a highly controlled manner. After elution, all normalized libraries have a concentration of 4 nM and can be easily pooled together for sequencing. The workflow is described in Figure 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.753#cpz1753-fig-0007].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/820865cb-4ce4-4fe0-a9a9-39692665534e/cpz1753-fig-0007-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 7\nWorkflow of library normalization.\nMaterials\nQIAseq Library Normalizer Kit (QIAGEN, cat. no. 180703, 180705):\n               \nNormalizer primer mix\nNormalizer reagent\nNormalizer wash buffer\nNormalizer elution buffer\nQIAseq Single Cell DNA Library Kit UDI (QIAGEN, cat. no. 181703, 181705, or 181707), or QIAseq Single Cell RNA Library Kit UDI (QIAGEN, cat. no. 180703, 1801705, or 180707):\n               \nHiFi PCR MMix\nQIAseq beads\n80% ethanol\nH2O sc\nTris·HCl, 10 mM, pH 8.0\nThermal cycler\nMagnetic stand\nLibrary amplification prior to normalization\n1.

Preheat normalizer wash buffer in a heat block or water bath to 55°C. If needed, thoroughly mix wash buffer and prepare aliquots for preheating. Prepare 450 μl of wash buffer per normalization reaction.",
    "If a water bath is available, preheat the whole wash buffer reagent bottle. If heating blocks for 1.5- to 2.0-ml tubes or 15-ml Falcon tubes are available, fill a sufficient amount of homogenized wash buffer into appropriate receptacles to preheat; 400 µl of wash buffer are required per normalization reaction. We recommend preheating 450 µl per reaction to account for any volume loss.\n15. Pipet 15 μl of each modified library into a 1.5-ml tube or well of a PCR plate. Leave the tube/plate at room temperature.\n16. Vortex normalizer reagent at least 60 s to achieve optimal homogenization.\nMake sure the pellet of beads is completely dissolved and the solution is well homogenized before use. If time has passed since initial homogenization, quickly homogenize again to prevent beads from settling directly before use.\n17. Add 5 μl of the homogenized normalization reagent to each 15 μl of prepared library and mix well.\n18. Incubate 10 min at room temperature.\n19. Add 200 μl pre-warmed normalizer wash buffer (55°C) to each tube.\n20.
