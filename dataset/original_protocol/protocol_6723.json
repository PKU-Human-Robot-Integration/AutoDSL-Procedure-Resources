    "Generation of GFP-LUHMES cells GFP-LUHMES cells are generated by the transduction of proliferative LUHMES cells with GFP-expressing lentiviral particles under the control of a PGK promoter (Ratcliffe et al., 2018).Seed proliferative LUHMES cells (p3-p5) at 1.5 x 106 per T75 flask.Transduce with GFP-expressing lentiviral particles for 24 h. MOI of 8; for transduction, a 1:100 dilution was used. Transduction efficiency was previously assessed by FACS sorting to be 98.5%.

The PBS should be left in the flask until immediately before the cells are seeded in the flask to prevent the coating from drying out. The flasks can be prepared up to 1 hour before use.Defrost and seed GFP-LUHMES cells into LUHMES Proliferation Media.",
    "Remove prepared LUHMES Proliferation Media from the fridge and allow to warm to room temperature.Take one frozen vial of GFP-LUHMES cells from freezer storage. Generally, we recommend to revive a vial of passage 1-10 so that revived cells can undergo numerous splits before retiring at passage 15.Add 10 ml room temperature LUHMES Proliferation Media to a 15 ml Falcon using a 10 ml serological pipette.Transfer ~500 μl of room temperature LUHMES Proliferation Media to the GFP-LUHMES cell vial using a P1000 mechanical pipette and slowly mix by aspirating and expelling the liquid in the tip repeatedly.When the solution in the GFP-LUHMES cell vial is fully defrosted, transfer to the solution to the room temperature LUHMES Proliferation Media in the 15 ml Falcon.Remove all 1x PBS from the coated T75 flask and add all of the cell solution from the 15 ml Falcon to the T75 flask using a 10 ml serological pipette.Tilt the flask back and forward and then side to side 2-3 times to distribute the GFP-LUHMES cells evenly over the coated surface.Incubate the flask in a 37 °C/5% CO2 incubator.On the following day, change the GFP-LUHMES cell media to remove any cells not fully attached.Remove all media from the T75 flask using a 10 ml serological pipette.Add 10 ml room temperature LUHMES Proliferation Media to the T75 flask using a 10 ml serological pipette.Incubate the flask in a 37 °C/5% CO2 incubator.Split the GFP-LUHMES cells every 3-4 days or when confluency is 80-90% in a sterile culture hoodPrepare two Fibronectin Poly-L-Ornithine coated T75 flasks according to the procedure described above (Step A2).Prepare LUHMES Proliferation Media and 1x Trypsin according to the recipes below.

Therefore, rotenone-treated media must be prepared at four times the desired final concentration (4 μM).Transfer 4 ml of LUHMES Differentiation Media to a 15 ml Falcon and label “Rotenone”. Transfer 4 ml of LUHMES Differentiation Media to another 15 ml Falcon and label “Vehicle”.Prepare 10 mM rotenone in ethanol. Rotenone powder should be weighed in a fume hood.Add 6.4 μl 10 mM rotenone to the media in the 15 ml Falcon labeled “Rotenone” using a P20 mechanical pipette. The final rotenone concentration in the well will be 4 μM.Add an equal volume of ethanol (6.",
    "4 μl) to the 15 ml Falcon labeled “Vehicle” using a P20 mechanical pipette.Mix both 15 ml Falcons by slowly inverting 3-4 times.Transfer treated media to the differentiated GFP-LUHMES 384-well plate. We suggest a plate map as shown in Figure 2A (i.e., “DMSO vehicle” wells are treated with vehicle-treated media, and all other wells treated with rotenone-treated media).Transfer the contents of “Rotenone” media Falcon and “Vehicle” media Falcon into separate reservoirs for multichannel pipetting. Label the reservoirs accordingly.Transfer 10 μl of rotenone-treated media to each well of the 384-well plate using a P10 multichannel mechanical pipette, ensuring the pipette tips are placed deep enough in the well to ensure ejected liquid mixes with the contents of the well. Leave some wells untreated for addition of vehicle-treated media to measure rotenone effect later. We suggest including vehicle-treating some wells in each DMSO only control column as explained in Step B3 below. Transfer 10 μl of vehicle-treated media to each untreated well of the 384-well plate using a P10 multichannel mechanical pipette.Incubate the 384-well plate in a 37 °C/5% CO2 incubator.Prepare compounds in DMSO and write protocols for using the  Echo 550  Liquid Handler and Opera Phenix High-Content Screening SystemPrepare compound library in 100% anhydrous DMSO on 384-well source plates (catalog number:  LP-0200  ) with plate seal. Store in the StoragePod Enclosure and maintain a dry nitrogen atmosphere using the MultiPod Controller.Write a compound transfer protocol using the Echo Liquid Handler software. The source plate should be set to “384LDV-DMSO”, the destination plate to “Griener_384PS_781096” and custom mapping should be selected.Set the protocol to transfer an appropriate volume from each well of the source plate to the corresponding well on the destination plate to give the desired final drug concentration.",
    "We suggest splitting the destination plate into quarters and using the first column of each quarter for DMSO only treatment to act as a negative control (Figure 2). Parameter values for each compound-treated well in each quarter can then be normalised to the respective DMSO control well values in that quarter. For a full dose response curve, we recommend testing 8 concentrations for each compound at every half-log, i.e., 3 nM, 10 nM, 30 nM, 100 nM, 300 nM, 1,000 nM, 3,000 nM, 10,000 nM. We also recommend including at least one positive control compound on each plate; we used a compound previously identified in house that showed beneficial effects on mitochondrial and morphological parameters.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3881/bioprotoc-11-01-3881-g002.jpgFigure 2. Plate map and example images following assaying of a GFP-LUHMES 384-well plate drug screen. A. Plate map showing the suggested arrangement of control wells and test compound wells. All wells are treated with rotenone except for “DMSO vehicle” wells. The colours represent the concentration in nM for each compound. B-D. Blue = DAPI, orange = TMRM, green = GFP, scale bars = 20 μm. Z stack maximum projection confocal images captured using the Opera Phenix High-Content Screening System from (B) a vehicle-treated DMSO control well, (C) a rotenone-treated DMSO control well and (D) a rotenone-treated positive control well (1,000 nM).Write an imaging protocol (details below) for imaging the LUHMES cells on the Harmony High-Content Imaging and Analysis Software. Use the DAPI, Alexa 488 and Cy3 channels to capture the Hoechst signal, GFP signal and TMRM signal respectively. Use test images to ensure appropriate exposure time for each laser; this needs to be set by the user as it depends on the signal strength of laser power of each imaging system.",
    "Use a 40x water confocal objective, set the number of fields to 10 and set the number of stacks to 6. Select the wells to be imaged (note the outermost two columns and rows cannot be imaged by the Opera Phenix) and select the location of the fields in each well.Treat differentiated GFP-LUHMES 384-well plate with compounds (Day 6)Depressurise the StoragePod Enclosure using the Multipod Enclosure and remove the 384-well source plate.Centrifuge the 384-well source plate at 2,500 x g for 2 min to remove any gas bubbles from the plate contents.Calibrate and focus on the  Echo 550  liquid handler before each independent plate shoot.Survey the 384-well ldv source plate using the  Echo 550  liquid handler. Ensure the volume in each well is high enough for transfer of the desired volume to the destination plate according to the compound transfer protocol. Note that the volume of each well in the 384-well source pate should not exceed 12 μl. Ensure that the water content of the contents of each well does not exceed 30% (this is inferred from the measurement of DMSO content which should not be lower than 70%; if this is the case then the contents of that well must be refreshed).Remove the seal from the 384-well source plate and initiate the compound transfer protocol. Transfer the 384-well source plate and the destination plate into the machine when prompted.When the protocol is complete, remove the destination plate and incubate immediately in a 37 °C/5% CO2 incubator.Replace the seal on the 384-well source plate and depressurise the StoragePod Enclosure using the Multipod Controller. Replace the 384-well source plate in the StoragePod Enclosure. Lock and repressurise the StoragePod Enclosure using the MultiPod Controller.Assay and image the GFP-LUHMES 384-well plate (Day 7)Prepare LUHMES Differentiation Media according to the recipe below.",

Open the connected CO2 gas cylinder when prompted. Allow the system to reach the desired temperature and gas level.Open the prepared imaging protocol.Load the GFP-LUHMES 384-well plate.Flush the water objective lens.Run a test and adjust the exposure time of each channel so that the intensity is significant over background levels. Adjust the height of the stacks if needed so that images are well focused across the height of the cell.Run the imaging protocol (Figure 2)."
