    "Patient samples were obtained in accordance with the protocols approved by the University of Pittsburgh's IRB (PRO17080326). Animal experimental methods were conducted under the protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pittsburgh.\n1. Isolation and validation of patient-derived carcinoma-associated mesenchymal stem cells (CA-MSCs)\nNOTE: CA-MSCs are derived from surgically resected human ovarian cancer tissue (this study uses high grade serous carcinoma), including the fallopian tube, ovary and/or omental metastatic deposits. CA-MSC medium is prepared from MEBM (mammary epithelial cell basal medium) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1x B27, 20 ng/mL EGF, 1 ng/mL hydrocortisone, 5 µg/mL insulin, 100 µM β-mercaptoethanol, 10 ng/mL β-FGF, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 20 µg/mL gentamicin7,13.\nCA-MSC isolation\n\t\nUsing a sterile scalpel and forceps, divide the tissue sample into pieces approximately 1 mm3 in size. Place three pieces of the tissue in each well of a 6-well cell culture plate.\n\t\tNOTE: 0.2 g of the tumor tissue can be cut into 12 pieces and can be distributed into four wells of a 6-well cell culture plate.\nAdd a thin layer of CA-MSC media, approximately 1 mL for each well. Place the cell culture plate in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in 5% CO2.\nAfter 24 h, remove the media carefully without disturbing the tissue pieces. Add approximately 1 mL of fresh media to each well. Pipette the media slowly without disturbing the tissue attachments. Place the cell culture plate back in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in 5% CO2.\n\t\tNOTE: Examine the tissue with an inverted microscope every day and change the media as described in step 1.1.3 whenever dead cells are visualized in the culture media.",
    "After 7 days, remove the tissue pieces by picking up the tissue using sterile forceps and wash the adherent cells once with PBS (PBS without Ca2+/Mg2+, 1 mL per well). Then, add fresh CA-MSC medium (2 mL per well) and place the cell culture plate in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in 5% CO2.\nExpansion of CA-MSCs\n\t\nWhen CA-MSCs start to grow from the tissue within the 6-well plate, examine the cells with an inverted microscope every other day to ensure cellular growth. Once the cells reach 90% confluency, proceed with the following steps.\nAspirate the media from the cell culture plate, then wash the cells once with 1-2 mL of PBS per well (PBS without Ca2+/Mg2+).\nAdd 300 µL per well of 0.05% trypsin/0.02% EDTA solution (trypsin/EDTA). Rotate the cell culture plate to cover the cells with trypsin/EDTA and return the cell culture plate to the incubator for 2-3 min or until the cells are detached.\nAdd fresh CA-MSC medium to inactivate the trypsin (1 mL per well) and re-suspend the cells. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and re-suspend the cells with growth medium. Transfer the re-suspended cells to a 25 cm2 flask with a total volume of 5 mL of culture media.\n\t\tNOTE: Cells collected from three wells of 6-well cell culture plate can be transferred into a 25 cm2 flask. Cells should be tested for the presence of mycoplasma (following an established mycoplasma detection protocol such as PCR) since they are derived from surgically resected human tissue14,15.",
    "Once the cells reach 70%-80 % confluency, transfer the cells from a 25 cm2 flask to a 75 cm2 flask following the previously described steps 1.2.2-1.2.4. Expand the cells every 5-7 days to obtain the cell number needed for CA-MSC validation and for the orthotopic inoculation procedure.\n\t\tNOTE: Since CA-MSCs are patient-derived cells, the cellular doubling time differs between cell lines. Most CA-MSCs require 3-4 days to double in number. However, some CA-MSCs require 5-7 days to double in number. CA-MSCs can be passaged 8-10 times. After passage 10, CA-MSCs may senesce or differentiate.\nCA-MSC validation\n\t\nValidation of CA-MSC surface expression: Use 0.5 x 106 CA-MSCs (approximately 70% confluency in a 75 cm2 flask) for flow cytometric analysis to ensure that CA-MSCs express appropriate surface markers as defined by the International Society for Cellular Therapy guidelines, as previously described (CD73/CD90/CD105 positive; CD45/CD34/CD14 or CD11b/CD79a or CD19/HLA-DR negative)7,16. Confirm the cell number after trypsinization and count using a hemocytometer with trypan-blue exclusion of dead cells.\n\t\tNOTE: If the flow cytometry analysis demonstrates that the cells are <90% pure, then sort the cells for the CA-MSC population.\nValidation of CA-MSC differentiation: To validate lineage differentiation, seed CA-MSCs into one well of a 6-well plate at a cell density of 5 x 104 cells/well in 2 mL of MSC media (one well per differentiation condition). After 24 h, change the media to the appropriate differentiation media to induce adipocyte vs chondrocyte vs osteocyte differentiation as previously described7,16.\n\t\tNOTE: As per ISCT guidelines, MSCs must demonstrate in vitro differentiation into at least two lines (adipocyte, chondrocyte, or osteocyte).",
    "On the day of the planned mouse injection procedure, collect the cells by following steps 1.2.2 and 1.2.4. Then, count the cells using a hemocytometer with trypan-blue exclusion for viability and re-suspend the cells in CA-MSC medium at a density of 1 x 108 cell/mL (0.5 x 106 CA-MSCs per injection). Place the suspended cells over ice.\n\tNOTE: Generally, at least 1 x 107 CA-MSCs can be derived from one tumor sample (0.2 g of tissue). This allows a single patient-derived CA-MSC line to be used for most mouse experiments. It is possible to combine CA-MSCs from different patients, but we recommend they are derived from the same ovarian cancer histologic subtype. Most CA-MSCs lines take 2 months and/or 6-7 passages to reach 1 x 107 cells. CA-MSCs can be frozen using standard cell freezing media and stored in liquid nitrogen indefinitely for later use.\n2. Preparation of the ovarian cancer cells\nMaintain OVCAR3-Luc cells in DMEM medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin (penicillin: 100 units/mL, streptomycin: 0.1 mg/mL). Culture cells at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator.\nOn the injection day, collect OVCAR3-Luc cells using the following steps.\n\t\nFirst, aspirate the media from the cell culture flask and wash the cells once with 5-7 mL of PBS per 75 cm2 flask (PBS without Ca2+/Mg2+). Aspirate the PBS and add trypsin/EDTA solution (2 mL per 75 cm2 flask). Then, return the cell culture flask to the incubator for 3-5 min or until the cells are detached.",
    "Using microscopy, ensure complete trypsinization of the cells (ensure that all the cells are detached from the culture flask). To halt trypsinization, add fresh serum-containing DMEM to the flask (2-3 mL per 75 cm2 flask) and re-suspend the cells. Using a pipette, transfer the cells to a 15 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and re-suspend the cells with growth medium. Then, count the cells and re-suspend in growth medium at a density of 1 x 108 cell/mL (0.5 x 106 OVCAR3-Luc cells per injection). Place the suspended cells over ice.\n3. Orthotopic inoculation\nPreparation of cell suspension\n\t\nMix CA-MSCs and OVCAR-Luc cells in a 1:1 ratio.\nThaw the frozen basement membrane matrix in an ice bath. Then, add the cell suspension prepared in step 3.1.1 to the basement membrane matrix at a ratio of 1:1 (final cell concentration: 1 x 106/ 20 µL of medium-basement membrane matrix) and blend thoroughly. The prepared cell suspensions should be kept in an ice bath until use.\n\t\tNOTE: Described here is a 1:1 CA-MSC to OVCAR-Luc ratio based on previous experience with the mentioned model. Previous work demonstrates that CA-MSCs are generally in a 1:10 ratio to tumor cells when quantified directly from patient tissue. As discussed below, starting with a 1:1 CA-MSC to tumor cell ratio yields an approximate 1:10 ratio of CA-MSC to tumor cells at both the primary and metastatic sites at experimental end points using this model.\nSurgery\n\tNOTE: Surgery should be performed in sterile conditions and sterile surgical instruments must be used. It is recommended that female NSG mice at 8 weeks of age are used for this orthotopic model.",
    "Anesthetize the mouse using inhalation with isoflurane (4% for induction, 2% for maintenance) and oxygen (100%, flow meter 0.5-1 L/min). Place the mouse on the pre-surgical nose cone system. To deliver anesthesia throughout the surgery (see detailed instructions below), insert the mouse's head into the isoflurane vaporizer nose cone system.\nSubcutaneously inject the mouse with 5 mg/kg of carprofen, a pre-surgical analgesic, with an insulin syringe.\nUsing clippers, shave the left caudal portion of the mouse between the costal margin and the femur. Sterilize the shaved area with povidone-iodine solution and alcohol swabs. Then, transfer the mouse to the surgical nose cone system and adjust the isoflurane to 1.5% for maintenance anesthesia.\nMake a 1-2 cm horizontal skin incision approximately 2-3 cm below the costal margin. Grasp the parietal peritoneum with forceps and elevate (the peritoneum will appear glossy and be characterized by deposits of adipose tissue). Make a 1 cm incision in the parietal peritoneum to open the abdominal cavity.\nObserve the collection of adipose tissue surrounding the mouse ovary (the ovarian bursa) upon peritoneal entry. Use curved forceps to grasp and expose the ovarian bursa. While firmly grasping the ovary with the forceps, inject 20 µL of the cell suspension prepared in step 3.1.2 into the bursa.\nCarefully return the ovary to the abdominal cavity. Using an absorbable polyglycolic acid 6-0 suture attached to a needle, reapproximate the edges of the parietal peritoneal incision. Close the skin incision with wound clips.\nRemove the mouse from the nose cone and place the mouse in a separate clean cage under warming light until it gains consciousness and maintains sternal recumbence. Then, return the mouse to its cage.",
    "Monitor the mice daily for 3-7 days following surgery. Place a cup of carprofen gel in the mouse cages for pain control. Remove the wound clips 7-10 days post-operatively.\n4. Monitoring tumor growth and mouse body weight weekly\nIn Vivo Imaging System (IVIS): Starting from week one after the orthotopic inoculation, perform in vivo imaging every week for the next 3-4 weeks.\n\t\nPrepare the solution of D-luciferin (substrate of firefly luciferase) by dissolving 15 mg in 1 mL PBS and filtering through a 0.22 µm membrane for sterilization.\nOperate the IVIS following the manufacturer's instructions. Click on the Living Image Software desktop icon. Then, on the IVIS Acquisition Control Panel, select Initialize. This step can take up to 10-15 min. During this time, prepare the mice for imaging.\nAnesthetize each mouse using the isoflurane chamber connected to IVIS (2%-4% isoflurane and oxygen flow meter to 0.5-1 L/min). Inject the D-luciferin (100 µL/10 g body weight) via intraperitoneal injection using an insulin syringe.\nPlace the luciferin-injected animal back into the isoflurane chamber.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important to record the injection time in order to keep the time consistent between luciferin injection and imaging performance throughout the study.\nTransfer the anesthetized mouse to the imaging chamber and set the imaging system to the appropriate settings. Then, acquire the image at the appropriate time.\nAfter saving the images, remove the mice from the imaging chamber and place them back into their respective cages.\n\t\t​NOTE: CA-MSCs can also be labeled with a fluorescent tag and migration/co-metastasis of CA-MSCs and OVCAR3-Luc cells monitored in vivo using a fluorescent channel on the IVIS.\n5. Assessing CA-MSC: tumor cell metastatic deposits",
    "On reaching their pre-defined endpoint (weight gain >20% with presence of ascites, weight loss <10%, tumor ulceration, body conditioning score of 2 or less17), euthanize the mice in accordance with institutional animal welfare standards.\nPerform necropsy on each mouse individually. Place an 18 G sterile needle intra-peritoneally to aspirate any ascites. Next, expose the thoracic and the abdominal cavity. Quantify the gross metastatic disease via visual inspection of tumor involvement of murine organs18.\nRemove the tumor tissue using a sterile scalpel and either i) fix in paraformaldehyde for eventual paraffin embedding, ii) flash freeze and embed into OTC cryostat embedding media, iii) flash freeze for downstream DNA, RNA or protein analysis, or iv) dissociate into single cells for flow cytometry or FACS isolation.\n\tNOTE: CA-MSCs remain viable in this model and can be re-isolated for downstream applications. Depending on the goal of the study, the CA-MSC to tumor cell interactions can be investigated via immunohistochemical approaches, flow cytometric approaches, or maintaining re-isolated cells in culture.\nSubscription Required.
