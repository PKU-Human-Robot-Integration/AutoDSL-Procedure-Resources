    "Cultivation and akinete inductionIn order to obtained sufficient biomass for akinete induction, cultivate  A. ovalisporum in Erlenmeyer flasks using 0.5-1.0 liters BG11 medium. Incubate cultures at 28 ℃ under continuous light (PAR) at intensity of 30 µmol photon m-2 s-1. Culture can be aerated at 0.5 liter/min using aquarium air pump. Toward the end of the exponential growth phase (after 7-10 days, OD750 should be around 1.0. In case this OD has not reach consider restart this step with a new inoculum), remove the culture to a lower temperature incubator (20-24 ℃). Allow 3-4 days of acclimation under continuous light (PAR) at intensity of 30 µmol photon m-2 s-1 and aeration. Then harvest the culture by centrifugation.Centrifuge the culture at 5,000 x g for 5-10 min at room temperature, discard the supernatant. If available, use a centrifuge with the rotor fitting 500 ml tubes or distribute the culture into 50 ml Falcon tubes and perform several rounds of centrifugation. At the end of centrifugation collect the biomass in one 50 ml falcon tube and discard as much of growth medium as possible.Wash the pellet in BG/-K medium 3 times by re-suspending the pellet in the potassium depleted medium by gently vortexing, followed by centrifugation at 5,000 x g at room temperature. Finally re-suspend the pellet in 0.5 liters BG/-K medium using a 1-liter Erlenmeyer flask. Incubate the K deprived culture at a controlled temperature between 20 and 24 ℃ under continuous light (PAR) at intensity of 70-80 µmol photon m-2 s-1.Sample 3-5 ml from the induced culture to follow the progress of the akinete differentiation process. Collect samples at days 4, 7, 10, 14, 21 and 28-post induction. Young akinetes attached to filaments can be observed since day 5 or 7.",
    "Later on, more attached akinetes can be observed together with free akinetes whose diameter is larger than the young attached akinetes (Figure 1).Note: Akinete differentiation is a non-synchronized process. Isolation of akinete [modified from Razquin et al. (1996)]Centrifuge a 21 (or 28) days old akinete-induced culture at 5,000 x g at room temperature for 5-10 min, discard the supernatant. Re-suspend the pellet and wash few times in Tris-EDTA-Mg buffer. Finally re-suspend the washed pellet in 20-50 ml Tris-Mg buffer and add lysozyme to a final concentration of 1 mg ml-1. Use freshly prepared lysozyme stock solution.Incubate the suspension for 2 h at 37 ℃ to allow the disruption of vegetative cells, followed by low speed (3,000 x g) centrifugation for 3 min. During the incubation period, sample the suspension for microscopic observation of cell disruption. If necessary, extend the incubation with lysozyme for an additional hour.Re-suspend the akinete-enriched pellet in TE buffer and wash several times in the same buffer to remove cellular residues and the soluble lysozyme. Finally re-suspend the akinete enriched pellet in Tris buffer keep on ice, and briefly sonicate it using 30% of the full intensity at 20 sec intervals (Sonifier 450). Repeat the sonication steps 3-5 times but monitor the akinete integrity under microscope. The aim of this sonication step is to disrupt intact vegetative cells that remained in the suspension. Be sure that the sonication is not too aggressive and akinetes survive this step. Centrifuge the akinete suspension at low speed (3,000 x g), wash it a few more times in sterile distilled water and finally re-suspend the pellet in a small volume of sterile distilled water. Keep the suspension at 15 ℃ and dark conditions. An akinetes’ suspension can be kept under those conditions for at least 6 months.",
    "At this stage, sample an aliquot from the akinete suspension for microscopic observation and enumeration.Counting akinetesCollect aliquots (1-3 ml) from cultures at various stages of akinete differentiation or during the akinete isolation process. Collect samples after vigorous shaking of the culture to ensure homogeneous suspension of filaments and akinetes. Preserve the samples in Lugol’s solution (add 1 drop-50 µl to 3 ml sample). Lugol-preserved samples can be stored at room temperature under dark until counting. Preserved samples can be stored for 4-6 months.Filaments, vegetative cells and akinetes are counted in an Utermohl sedimentation chamber using an inverted microscope (Utermohl, 1958). Two categories of akinetes can be defined; filament-attached akinetes (Figure 1. D7 and D14) and mature free akinetes (Figure 1. D21 and IA). The size of filament-attached akinetes increased as their differentiation proceeded and they exceeded a biomass of 0.4 ng (Sukenik et al., 2013). During their differentiation, akinetes are characterized by a thickened the cell wall and the accumulation of apparent cyanophycin granules (Figure 1). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160517/20160517010221_3186.jpgFigure 1.

D0, A filament with vegetative cells prior the induction (transfer to a BG/-K medium); D7, A filament 7 days post induction. Note the presence of young akinetes (arrowhead); D14, A filament 14 days post induction. A well-developed attached akinetes is marked with an arrowhead; D21, A short filament with attached akinetes and free akinetes 21 days post induction; IA, Isolated akinetes. Gray arrowheads in D7 and D14 indicate cyanophycine granule. Scale bar = 10 µmQuality control of isolated akinetesResidual lysozyme on isolated akinetesAlthough the isolated akinetes suspension is vigorously washed to remove excess lysozyme, we found residual lysozyme in the akinete fraction, presumably associated with cell walls. These residues may interfere later on with akinete germination.",
    "The removal of the enzyme from the isolated akinetes is carried out by several washes with TE Buffer containing 100 mM NaCl as assessed by SDS-12% PAGE (Figure 2). Note: Three washes with TE + 100 mM NaCl are sufficient to remove residual lysozyme from lysozyme treated isolated akinetes.Assessment of akinete vitalityIn order to assess the percentage of vital akinetes use SYTOX solution at final concentration of 1 µM. SYTOX is a high affinity nucleic acid stain that can enter the cell only through damaged plasma membranes, such as those of dead cells. Thus it is possible to discriminate between dead and live akinetes. As a confirmation of vital akinetes, it is recommended to use SYTOX staining in addition to auto-fluorescence of the phycobilisome antenna and Chlorophyll a in viable akinetes (Figure 3). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160517/20160517010307_8691.jpgFigure 2. The effect of salt titration on lysozyme dissociation from akinetes. Proteins were separated on Laemmmli SDS-PAGE system (12% acrylamide) and stained by Coomassie blue. M, Molecular Weight Markers (All Blue pre-stained protein standards, M. W. 10-250 kD); AK, crude soluble protein extracted from isolated akinetes; Lanes 0 to 420 are soluble proteins after isolated akinete were washed with TE Buffer + NaCl at different concentrations (0-420 mM NaCl, respectively). Lyzozyme peptide (MW 14.4 kD) released by that treatment is indicated by an arrow. Notice the higher the salt concentration more lysozyme dissociated from isolated akinetes.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160518/20160518000017_5950.pngFigure 3.
