    "1. Setting up the Endoscopy System\nSet up the endoscopy system before anesthetizing the mice, following the manufacturer's instructions. Use a video ureteroscope designed for humans for this protocol (Figure 1). The outer diameter of the insertion tube is 9.9 Fr (3.3 mm), its distal end is 8.5 Fr (2.8 mm), and the inner diameter of the instrumentation channel is 6 Fr (1.2 mm).\nAlthough the use of endoscopes have not been linked to disease transmission [9], sterilize the endoscope and lens with 70% ethanol10 or with appropriate techniques when working with spore-forming microorganisms. Prepare bacteriostatic sterile lubricant and non-scratching wipe tissues to saturate the endoscope tip.\nAttach a 3 ml syringe full of air (or a suitable CO2 gas mixture) to the top of the instrumentation channel.\nTurn on the power, and set up the white balance in normal white light, as well as narrow band imaging (NBI) mode, when applicable. Since 2001, NBI has provided diagnostic imaging benefits as it emphasizes fine blood vessel structures on mucous membranes, including ulcerative and tumorous lesions, which have characteristic abnormal vascularization11. NBI-filter mode restricts the wavelength of captured light to 390-445 nm and 530-550 nm, which highlights structures with hemoglobin.\nPrint the assessment scoring form (Figure 2) to record your findings. Become familiar with expected normal and NBI images (Figure 3A) and the definition and grades of each criterion before the exam (see Section 6.1).",
    "Prepare a colorant-based solution on phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for chromoendoscopy, if desired. In chromoendoscopy, the exam is performed using a dye as contrast medium to highlight mucosal changes. Use methylene blue (0.1-1%) and indigo carmine (0.1%) solutions (Figure 3B). Note that methylene blue is an oxidation-reduction agent that can produce oxidizing radicals, indirect cross-linking of amino acid residues, and DNA degradation12, which could interfere with sample analysis.\n2. General Anesthesia of the Mouse\nChoose the anesthetic agent and administration route. Consult a veterinarian from an animal resource facility or Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) regarding potential interference of medications with the immune system and research goals. Some medications may influence cytokine profile expression in animals, including rodents13. Use injectable tribromoethanol for terminal procedures or isoflurane for survival endoscopies, along with appropriate controls.\nFor induction, administer 4-5% of isoflurane in 100% oxygen at a rate of 0.2-0.5 L/min; use 0.5-2% for maintenance. This protocol is not appropriate for all animals. Consult your facility veterinarian for proper instructions and training. Abide by relevant IACUC recommendations to achieve the highest standards for animal welfare. Make sure that the mouse if fully anesthetized.\n‘Strap’ the anesthetized mouse to a supporting surface table in a dorsal or ventral position using laboratory adhesive tape. Beware of the anatomical orientation on your endoscope screen. Secure its lower extremities and tail. A band of tape can also be placed over the chest to prevent movement away from the respirator, but avoid restricting thoracic ventilatory movements.\n3. Detailed Endoscopic Examination\nLook for perianal lesions before inserting the endoscope into the rectum, then advance the scope through the anus.\nCoat the endoscope with sterile surgical lubricant. Be sure not to coat the surface of the CCD (charge coupled device) sensor.",
    "Insert the endoscope and start recording. Recorded videos are useful for meticulous evaluation of endoscopy if needed after the examination. Try to perform the endoscopy in the least possible length of time to minimize intestinal/mucosal irritation.\nApply air by using a syringe to slowly set apart the intestinal walls. Depending on the size of the mouse, use 1-2 ml of air. Avoid excessive air insufflation; it may cause respiratory distress and death of the anesthetized mouse.\nAdvance the endoscope forward as you clear the way with air or gentle rotation of the scope. Do not advance the endoscope if you do not see the intestinal lumen. Perforations or rectal/colonic tears can occur at this stage, especially in young mice (<8-10 weeks old). Take pictures as necessary.\nAs the scope advances, assess if there is spontaneous bleeding (defined as naturally occurring mucosal hemorrhaging not associated with traumatic endoscopy). Spontaneous bleeding can be observed as the endoscope enters the rectum and colon.\nAssess the transparency of the colonic wall. Transparency is defined as the ability to visualize the intramural blood vessels in the colon and that of the other surrounding viscera (Figure 4). Gentle motion of the scope (back-forward, clockwise, counterclockwise) will help determining if blood vessels can be seen in the context of other viscera. Mesenteric adipose tissue can also be seen. Note if the rectum inside the pelvic cavity appears less transparent than the colonic wall in the abdominal cavity.\nInspect to determine the type and number of focal lesions (edematous areas, erosions, ulcers, tumorous masses). This will be recorded in the scoring form using the colonic inflammation score and the decimal identifiers that have been developed.",
    "Once the area where the colon flexes caudally into the proximal colon is reached, withdraw the endoscope slowly and look for the presence of contact bleeding (which occurs due to mucosal friability after the endoscope is advanced or removed). It is not necessary to scrape the colon surface intentionally. Healthy colorectal mucosa does not bleed after proper endoscopic examination.\n4. Biopsy\nWhen biopsies are needed, insert the biopsy forceps through the endoscope channel dedicated for instrumentation. Monitor the advancement of the forceps on the endoscope screen to prevent intestinal perforation.\nOpen the biopsy cups of the forceps to about a 60-80° cup-to-cup angle, and direct them to the area of interest. Excessively opened forceps or pressure may grasp extra layers of intestinal tissue, which results in a biopsy-induced perforation of healthy transparent intestinal walls. If perforation occurs, euthanize the animal during anesthesia following your IACUC recommendations. Perforations result in endotoxemia and peritonitis.\nClose the biopsy cups, and pull them out while keeping the forceps closed.\nRemove the specimen from the forceps by flushing the tissue with a solution that is gentle to the tissue and the forceps. RNA later and PBS are common working solutions; if needed, use the needle to dislodge the sample. Avoid eroding the forcep cups or cutting edges.\n5. Recovery from Anesthesia\nUpon completion of the examination, provide a warm environment to the mouse until it recovers. Use either an electric light, or a warm pad set at 37 °C. Avoid overheating; peripheral vasodilation compromises animal recovery. Monitor the mouse closely until full recovery.\n6. Integrated Endoscopic Scoring System of Colorectal Health with Decimal Identifiers\nUse the scoring form (Figure 2) and the parameter definitions below (Endoscopic Assessment of Murine Colorectal",
    "Inflammation and Tumors Using a Decimal-weighted Scoring System: Parameter Definitions, and Protocol) for examples and the optional 'Distal-Proximal Endoscopic Colitis scoring system' (D-PECS) as guidelines for nonbiased assessment and detailed record keeping.\nScore the four parameters of colorectal inflammation described on the scoring system form (Figure 2). Meticulously evaluate the perianal region, intestinal transparency, type of intestinal bleeding (if present), and presence and quantity of focal lesions (erosive, ulcerative, and/or tumorous). \nWhen assessing tumors for research purposes, examine the quantity, location, and size, and describe them using the colonic map and bar graph on the scoring form. The numerical sum of the scores obtained and number of lesions (when applicable) will determine the background colonic inflammation, the most predominant type of lesion, and the number of lesions.\nSubscription Required.
