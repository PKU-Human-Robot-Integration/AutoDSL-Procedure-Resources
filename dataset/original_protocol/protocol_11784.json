    "All research and animal care procedures were approved by the Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and housed in the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care-approved animal facility at Baylor College of Medicine. All strains were maintained on C57BL6 background.\n1. Embryo dissection (E7.5-E9.5)\nRemove uterine horns from a pregnant female mouse, sterilizing the abdomen with 70% ethanol where the incision is to be made.\nClean off the uterus by rinsing with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Place the uterus into a sterile plastic 10 cm dish.\nUsing microdissection scissors, separate each decidua containing region from one another. Peel off the uterine muscle and expose all deciduae. One by one, remove the decidua from each embryo.\nRemove the yolk sac from each embryo and save for genotyping.\nMove all embryos into a new dish of fresh PBS for imaging.\nTake an image of the entire litter. Image each embryo individually and count the number of somites of each embryo. Keep the magnification and exposure (for fluorescence) the same between experiments.\n\tNOTE: We find that 50-200 ms exposure is adequate for fluorescence and that 20 ms is adequate for bright field setting.\n2. Embryo dissociation and cell sorting\nFor each embryo to be sorted from, do the following.\n\t\nDecapitate just above the otic placode for embryos older than E8.0 (if only labeled cells of the cranial region are desired). For E7.5 embryos, remove extraembryonic structures (if only the embryo proper is desired).\nMove the head in a minimal volume of PBS over to a clean well of a 48-well plate. Add 250 µL of papain (27 U/mL). Pipette up and down gently using a p200.\nCheck under the microscope and look for clumps and single cells.",
    "Repeat gentle pipetting up and down until a single cell suspension is achieved (usually three rounds of pipetting up and down which should equate to between 30 s to 1 min for E7.5-E9.5).\nQuench with 250 µL of fetal bovine serum (FBS).\nRepeat steps 2.1.1-2.1.5 for each embryo to be sorted.\nFilter 500 µL of cell suspension through a 35 µm nylon mesh filter cap tube to remove clumps.\nTake the filtrate and move to new 1.5 mL tube and spin at 200 x g for 5 min. Remove supernatant carefully and transfer to new tube (save until live cells are known to be in the pellet).\nResuspend cell pellet in 300 µL of PBS containing 0.5-1% bovine serum albumin and keep on ice until sorting (minimize the time between now and the end of sorting).\n\t\nIf desired, take 10 µL of cell suspension and combine with 10 µL of Trypan blue (0.4%) and count using a hemocytometer to identify approximate cell quantification and viability as Trypan blue only stains dead cells.\nJust before sorting, filter each sample again through a filter cap tube and add DAPI stain for live cells.\nSort each sample into 500 µL of RNA extraction lysis solution (see Table of Materials) on cell sorter with 70 µm nozzle.\nMix and store at -80 °C until all samples are harvested. Proceed from this point only when all samples needed for an experiment are harvested to reduce technical variation between rounds of library preparation.\n3. RNA extraction\nNOTE: The protocol is adapted from the RNA isolation kit; see Table of Materials.\nAdd 500 µL of RNA extraction lysis solution (see Table of Materials) to each sample to make the total volume 1000 µL.\nThaw each sample at room temperature.",
    "Vortex each sample for 1.5 min, making sure that the cap is securely on each tube before starting homogenization. Incubate the homogenate at room temperature (15–25 °C) for 5 min.\nAdd 140 µL of chloroform, cap tube securely and shake vigorously for 15 s. Incubate at room temperature for 3 min.\nCentrifuge for 15 min at 12,000 x g at 4 °C. Transfer the upper aqueous phase to a new collection tube on ice. Do not transfer any interphase or any organic phase. When approaching the pink organic phase, tip the tube to side and remove small aliquots until no clear aqueous phase can be collected.\nMeasure the volume of RNA containing aqueous phase collected from each sample for the correct calculation in the next step.\nAdd 1.5 volumes (usually 525 µL but may be slightly more or less) of 100% ethanol and mix thoroughly by pipetting.\nPipette up to 700 µL sample, including any precipitate, into column in a 2 mL collection tube. Close the lid and centrifuge at ≥8,000 x g for 15 s at room temperature. Discard the flow-through.\nRepeat step 3.8 using the remainder of the sample.\nWash the column as per manufacturer instructions. Dry the column by spinning at full speed for 1 min. Transfer the column to a new 1.5 mL collection tube.\nPipette 11 µL of nuclease free water onto the center of the membrane. Let sit at room temperature for 1 min. Spin max speed for 1 min to elute off the column.\nMeasure RNA concentration using a spectrophotometer and a parallel capillary electrophoresis instrument (Table of Materials).\n4. Library preparation\nNOTE: The protocol is adapted from small RNA library preparation kit handbook; see Table of Materials.",
    "Complete the denaturation and 3’ adapter ligation as stated in the small RNA library preparation kit handbook using ¼ dilution of 3’ adapter.\nContinue to excess 3' adapter removal.\nComplete the adapter depletion as stated in the small RNA library preparation kit handbook. Be sure to use freshly prepared 80% ethanol for the bead cleanup and that all excess ethanol is completely removed just prior to the resuspension in nuclease-free water without over-drying the beads (cracking of the bead pellet is observed upon over-drying).\nProceed directly to excess adapter inactivation.\nComplete the excess adapter inactivation as stated in the small RNA library preparation kit handbook assembling all reagents on ice.\nContinue to 5' 4N adapter ligation.\nComplete 5' adapter ligation as stated in the small RNA library preparation kit handbook being sure to use a ¼ dilution of the 5’ adapter and assembling all reagents on ice.\nProceed to reverse transcription.\nComplete reverse transcription-first strand synthesis as stated in the small RNA library preparation kit handbook and taking care to assemble all reagents on ice and not keeping the enzyme out of the freezer for extended periods of time.\n\tNOTE: At this point, the protocol may be stopped, with samples stored overnight at 4 °C. Alternatively continue to PCR amplification.\nComplete PCR amplification by assembling the reagents as stated in the small RNA library preparation kit handbook and minimizing the number of PCR cycles. The number of PCR cycles should be experimentally determined for each application and the minimum number of cycles should be used. Here we used 16 cycles to successfully amplify our small RNA libraries.\nProceed directly to size selection.\n5. Size selection\nTo each sample, add 5 µL of 6x gel loading dye and pipette to mix.",
    "Load 10 µL of ladder to the first well of the gel, leaving the well immediately to the right empty. Load all of product from step 5.1 onto a 6% Tris/borate/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid – polyacrylamide gel (TBE-PAGE) and leave 1 lane in between each sample.\n\tNOTE: Keep the container that the gel came in for subsequent steps.\nRun the gel at 150 V for approximately 30-40 min in 0.5x TBE running buffer (until the lower dye band is near the bottom of the gel, 0.5-1 cm).\nMake 1 L of staining solution while the gel is running: SYBR Gold diluted 1:10,000 in 0.5x TBE.\nWhen the gel has finished running (i.e., lower dye band is near the bottom of the gel), carefully remove the gel from the glass plates, noting the orientation of the gel.\nPlace gel in the tray of its original packaging. Remove the 0.5x TBE and replace with the staining solution from step 5.5. Stain gel for 15 min. Staining time may need to be increased.\nPlace the gel on a UV transilluminator, taking care to not rip the gel and maintaining the orientation noted above (re-stain for additional time if bands of ladder cannot be clearly seen).\nImage the gel once staining is complete on UV transilluminator with a camera.\n\t\nIf a better image is required, first use an imaging apparatus other than the UV transilluminator to capture an image of the gel before cutting out the bands on a UV transilluminator as imaging directly on the UV transilluminator causes the variable coloring of the background as shown in Figure 3A-B. Do not move the gel too many times as it is delicate and may tear.",
    "Identify and remove the ~150 bp band using a clean razor blade and place into clean 1.5 mL tube. Do not cut out the ~130 bp band (adapter dimer product).\n\t\nImage the gel again after removing the slices containing the library product for documentation purposes.\nSpin the microcentrifuge tubes containing the gel slice at max speed for 30 s to collect the slices at the bottom of each tube.\nUse a p200 tip for each sample to crush the slice of gel into the smallest bits possible. Eject each tip into each tube.\nTo each tube, add 300 µL of elution buffer, taking care to wash gel bits from side of tube and reattach the p200 tip and wash off the tip for each sample.\nPlace the eluting samples in a shaking incubator set to 25 °C. Incubate overnight with 1000 rpm shaking. Remove tubes from incubator and spin at max speed for 10 min at room temperature.\nTransfer the supernatant containing the library product to a 2 mL RNase free 96 well plate. Take care to not transfer any gel.\nAdd 50 µL cleanup beads to each sample and mix by pipetting. Immediately, add 350 µL of isopropanol and mix by pipetting. Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes with rocking.\nPulse spin plate to pellet beads and then magnetize for 2 min. Carefully remove and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 950 µL of 80% ethanol. Incubate for 30 s. Remove all of the supernatant. Repeat for a total of two ethanol washes.\nDry the sample for 3 min. At this step take care to remove any residual ethanol that collects at the bottom of each well (not more than once) and to not over-dry the beads (over-drying will result in cracking of the bead pellet).",
    "Remove all residual liquid at the bottom of the well. Remove the plate from the magnetic stand.\nResuspend the pellet in 13 µL of resuspension buffer. Mix by pipette until homogeneous. Incubate for 2 min and then magnetize for 3 min.\nTransfer 12 µL of supernatant to a clean tube or well of clean plate for subsequent storage. Store all samples at 4 °C overnight or -20 °C long term.\nCheck the size and concentration of fragments present in each library using the capillary electrophoresis high sensitivity DNA assay. Confirm the concentration with more than one method.\n\tNOTE: We have occasionally used the standard sensitivity kit to avoid overloading the capillary electrophoresis."
