    "The experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Research Committee of National Defense Medical College (no. 16058). The animals were maintained on standard laboratory chow (CLEA Japan Inc, Tokyo, Japan). The laboratory animals were treated in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines.\n1. Collection and separation of lymphocytes\nNOTE: Since lymphocytes must be fresh and cannot be stored, they must be collected from rats for each experiment. In addition, gut-tropic lymphocytes must be collected directly from the thoracic duct where they circulate. All procedures are expected to be completed within 6 hours, and all instruments, gloves, and surfaces are clean. In order to keep the animals in a physiologically stable state, all saline and other fluids used in the experiment should be kept warm.\nForm a cannulation tube (1 mm diameter) like a heparin curve (a radius of about 5 mm) after dipping it in hot water (about 80–90 °C) and fix it to a plastic board using adhesive tape for a few hours in advance.\nAnesthetize a male Wistar rat (8–12 weeks) with intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of Midazolam (2mg/kg), Domitor (0.15mg/kg), and Betulphar (2.5mg/kg) and cut the body hair of the abdomen using a hair clipper. Remove the hair firmly after shaving so that the hair does not enter the abdominal cavity.\nAfter confirming that the stable depth of anesthesia required for the procedure is obtained by toe pinch, make an incision with surgical scissors horizontally from midline to the left subcostal area. Be careful not to damage the blood vessels in the parietal peritoneum by watching the vessels under light.",
    "Wrap the stomach with wet gauze and move the stomach gently to the right outside of the body to reveal the retroperitoneal organs. Insert a notch between the erector muscles of the spine and the adipose tissue using surgical scissors and bluntly separate them with fingers.\nCarefully strip off the connective tissue around the thoracic duct. The excess connective tissue increases with age. Expose the thoracic duct from just beneath the left crus of the diaphragm caudally until a 20 mm length of the thoracic duct was visible. Gently separate adhesions between the thoracic duct and aorta using precision tweezers or wet cotton swabs.\n\t\nPerform this process carefully because some rats have arterioles branching from the abdominal artery crossing over the thoracic duct or a short thoracic duct due to a higher position of the lymph plexus (small thoracic ducts spreading like spider webs). Avoid unnecessary contact to the thoracic duct to avoid inducing edema.\nApply a ligature by a string (3-0 silk) on the thoracic duct just beneath the left crus of the diaphragm. The caudal thoracic duct becomes distended.\nMake a hole (5 mm diameter) in the abdominal wall by stabbing the cutting edge of surgical scissors, pass the hairpin-curved cannulation tube, and ligate the tube on the iliopsoas muscle at one point. Fill the cannulation tube with normal saline containing 10 U/mL heparin.\nAfter placing a string (3-0 silk) beneath the distended thoracic duct, stab the thoracic duct with the sharply cut edge of a cannulation tube, cannulate it toward the tail about 5 mm, and ligate the thoracic duct with cannulation tube for fixation.",
    "To supply saline to prevent dehydration, create a hole (3 mm diameter) on the anterior wall of the antrum of the stomach using precision tweezers and pass the silicon tube (2 mm in diameter) to the duodenum through the pyloric ring. After stitching up a wound and maintaining the animals in Bollman’s cages, start to infuse sugar-laden saline into each rat’s duodenum from the silicon tube at a flow rate of 3 mL/h. Cover the entire cage with a paper towel to keep it warm.\nFix the cannulation tube to the hole in the center of the lid of a 50-mL conical tube on ice containing 6 U/mL heparin, 10% fetal bovine serum, and RPMI 1640 medium (pH 7.4; see the table of materials), and collect thoracic duct lymphocytes (TDLs) on ice. Be careful not to contact the tip of the tube to the wall of the conical tube to prevent cannulated-tube occlusion due to fibrin clot formation inside the tube. Lymph fluid (about 20 mL) including about 1.0 x 108～109 lymphocytes can be obtained in 6 hours. To obtain the lymphocytes  under complete anesthesia, plane of anesthesia is monitored and lymph flow is observed appropriately. The same anesthetics are added at the same dose about 3 hours after rats are put into Ballman's cage to obtain deep anesthesia continuously for 6 hours.\n2. Lymphocyte labeling with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFDSE)\nDissolve CFDSE (Table of Materials) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to 15.6 mM (500 µg of CFDSE dissolved in 60 µL of DMSO).\nIncubate lymphocytes (1 x 108～109) in 50 mL of RPMI 1640 with 50 µL of CFDSE solution for 30 min at 37 °C as described previously10.\n3. Experimental setup for microvascular studies",
    "Anesthetize recipient rats (8–12 weeks) with intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of Midazolam (2mg/kg), Domitor (0.15mg/kg), and Betulphar (2.5mg/kg) and confirm the depth of anesthesia by toe pinch. Wet the abdomen before grooming the fur to minimize hair contamination. Then open the abdomen of the recipient Wister rat via a midline incision.\nPut a rat on a portable stainless-steel plate (about 120 x 300 mm) with a rectangle hole around the center covered with a glass slide (24 x 50 mm). Choose about 10 cm of the ileal segment including PPs for observation.\nKeep the intestine as warm as possible and moist with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) warmed to 37 °C. Soak gauze that is used to cover the small intestine with PBS.\n While giving continuous anesthesia with 2 % isoflurane (see table of materials), put the slide on the stage of the microscope and choose suitable areas for observation of the microcirculation in PPs where some HEVs are running through the serosa. PPs range in size; larger ones are suitable for observation of the microcirculation using CLSM. The small intestine is not straight in places; a straight segment at least 2 cm long without any tension is suitable for observation.\nCover the adjacent intestinal segment and mesentery with absorbent cotton soaked with PBS. Place the intestine segment between two rolled cotton balls and position it as far as possible from the rat’s body to prevent it from being vibrated by the rat’s heartbeat and breathing.\nUsing a 1 mL syringe, slowly inject (over 1 min) CFSE-labeled TDLs (1 x 108 cells) into the jugular vein of the recipient rats. A rapid intravenous injection may influence the systemic circulation.\n4. Microcirculation of lymphocytes",
    "Continuously monitor TDLs in the microvasculature of PPs using CLSM and record on a computer for 3 hours using time-lapse photography at 30 s intervals. The depth from the serosa to the HEV of PPs is about 25 μm, enabling the observation of the stroma and capillary lymph vessels to a depth of 30 μm.\nInject Texas Red–dextran (25 mg/kg) into the jugular vein of each recipient rat to stain the bloodstream and Hoechest 33342 (5 mg/kg) to stain the cell nuclei.\n(Optional) To quantify lymphocyte dynamics, define lymphocytes adhering to HEVs more than 30 seconds as “adhesive lymphocytes” and lymphocytes emigrating from HEVs to stroma as ‘‘migrating lymphocytes”. Then calculate the average percentage of migration (migrating lymphocytes / adhesive lymphocytes + migrating lymphocytes) per field of vision (approximately 0.3 mm2).\nSubscription Required.
