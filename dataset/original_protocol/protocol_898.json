Do not use more than 400 mg agarose per column, do not heat gel slice in lysis buffer to 50ºC, 25ºC should suffice under constant agitation for 10-15 min \\(ensure that gel slice is completely dissolved)\n• Elute in 50 µl EB, repeat elution with eluate\n• Pool the elution fractions of five columns and purify again \\(QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen, Cat No.28104)\n• Elute in 50 µl EB, repeat elution with eluate\n• Determine DNA concentration \\(you need 1 µg of fragmented and purified BAC/gDNA per adapter ligation reaction) \n**2.

    "The following part of the protocol is based on the manual of NEBNext Ultra™ II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina \\(E7645S). Use 1 µg DNA starting material per reaction, perform 1 adapter ligation reaction for focused libraries and 5 for genome-wide libraries, use NEBNext hairpin-adapters from NEB, USER enzyme \\(both contained in NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina \\(E7335L)) and follow the manufacturer's instructions.\n**2.2 Cleanup of adaptor-ligated DNA library with Agencourt AMPure XP beads**\nSince the NEBNext Ultra II Ligation Master Mix is very viscous clean up 2x with Agencourt AMPure XP \\(Beckman Coulter; Cat No. A63881). \n**AMPure XP bead clean-up:**\nNote: Keep the supernatant until confirmation that the clean-up worked, keep strip on magnet at all time \\(except elution), pipette always onto the magnet opposing tube wall.\n• Bring beads to room temperature and mix thoroughly by vortexing before use\n• Add 90 µl of adaptor ligation reaction to PCR strip\n• Add 1.8 vol. beads \\(162 µl) to 1 vol.
