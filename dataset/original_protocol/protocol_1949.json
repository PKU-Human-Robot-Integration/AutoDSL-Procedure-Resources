    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSpleen collection and preparation of erythrocyte-lysed single cell suspension\nTiming: 30 min\nThe following steps describe the isolation of murine spleens with subsequent preparation of erythrocyte lysed single cell suspensions.\nNote: Prepare all steps on ice or with appropriate cooling. The temperature for centrifugation should be 10°C as we noticed that centrifugation at the typically stated 4°C can lead to lower temperatures during the centrifugation process and thus freezing of the samples (especially when working with small volumes).\nSpleen Collection.\nEuthanize mice using an institutionally approved method (e.g., CO2 asphyxiation).\nPlace the mouse right side down on a dissection mat and spray fur with 70% ethanol to disinfect.\nUsing blunt forceps and scissors, make an incision in the skin on the left thorax just below the ribcage until the spleen is visible.\nCarefully lift the spleen out of the abdomen with an additional pair of forceps and remove any non-splenic tissue as good as possible.\nNote: remaining non-splenic tissue can lead to increased clump formation and thus reduced cell counts.\nPreparation of single cell suspension.\nPlace the spleen in a 70 μm cell strainer on top of a 50 mL conical tube.\nSmash the spleen using a sterile plunger of a 5 mL syringe while rinsing the cell strainer with appropriate amount of ice cold 1× PBS.\nMake sure to flush through all remaining cells in the cell strainer and attached to the plunger.\nDiscard the cell strainer, close the tube and keep on ice until further procedure.\nHypotonic erythrocyte lysis.\nNote: This is a protocol for performing hypotonic erythrocyte lysis. Of course, other established protocols for red blood cell lysis can be used.\nCentrifuge the sample at 400 × g for 5 min at 10°C.",
    "Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL ice-cold 1× PBS.\nAdd 9 mL of distilled water and incubate for 20 s.\nStop lysis by adding 1 mL 10× PBS.\nPour cell suspension through 40 μm cell strainer to remove clumps that may have formed inter alia due to remaining non-splenic tissue.\nCentrifuge the sample at 400 × g for 5 min at 10°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend in 10 mL ice-cold 1× PBS.\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer or an automated cell counter.\nTake out no more than 1 × 107 cells and transfer to a new tube. Remaining cells can be discarded or used for other applications.\nNote: For the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit from Qiagen the maximum number of cells is 1 × 107 cells. Here we used between 0.5 – 1 × 107 cells. When using other kits for RNA isolation cell numbers might need to be adapted according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nCentrifuge cells at 400 × g for 5 min at 10°C.\nCarefully discard the supernatant completely.\nNote: Incomplete removal of the supernatant will inhibit lysis and dilute the lysate. These factors may reduce the RNA yield.\nPause point: Proceed with RNA extraction following manufacturer’s protocol or snap freeze the cell pellet in liquid nitrogen before storage at −80°C.\nNote: We would recommend to immediately proceed with RNA isolation to yield high RNA amounts.\nRNA extraction\nTiming: 40 min\nRNA extraction is performed using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit from Qiagen (#74134) according to manufacturer’s instruction. However, other methods suitable for efficient RNA extraction can be used. Please refer to Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] for a rapid overview of this step.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1547-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Workflow for RNA extraction",
    "Critical: Properly clean all surfaces with RNase AWAY or another alternative (this includes for example bench, centrifuge, pipettors, pipette tip boxes or tube holder).\nNote: Freshly prepare Buffer RLT + beta-Mercaptoethanol (for example: Sigma-Aldrich; #M6250-100ML) according to manufacturer’s instruction for all samples processed on the same day. Thus, add 10 μL beta-Mercaptoethanol per 1 mL Buffer RLT.\nFlick the tube to thoroughly loosen the cell pellet, add 600 μL Buffer RLT + beta-Mercaptoethanol (10 μL beta-Mercaptoethanol per 1 mL Buffer RLT) and carefully pipette up and down to properly lyse the cells.\nTransfer the lysate into a QIAshredder spin column (Qiagen, #79656; not included in the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit from Qiagen) placed in a 2 mL collection tube and centrifuge for 2 min at 14,000 × g at room temperature (around 19°C–23°C).\nTransfer the homogenized lysate to a gDNA Eliminator spin column placed in a 2 mL collection tube. Centrifuge for 30 s at 14,000 × g at room temperature (around 19°C–23°C). Discard the column and save the flow-through.\nAdd 600 μL of 70% ethanol to the flow-through and mix well by pipetting.\nTransfer up to 700 μL of the sample, including any precipitate that may have formed, to a RNeasy spin column placed in a 2 mL collection tube. Close the lid gently, and centrifuge for 15 s at 14,000 × g at room temperature (around 19°C–23°C). Discard the flow-through and repeat this step with the remaining flow-through (approximately 500 μL).\nAdd 700 μL Buffer RW1 to the column and centrifuge for 15 s at 14,000 × g at room temperature (around 19°C–23°C) to wash the column. Discard the flow-through.\nAdd 500 μL Buffer RPE working solution to the column and centrifuge for 14,000 × g at room temperature (around 19°C–23°C). Discard the flow-through.",
    "Note: Buffer RPE is supplied as a concentrate. Ensure that 4 volumes of ethanol have been added before use, as indicated on the bottle. For example, for the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (50) add 44 mL of ethanol to 11 mL of RPE stock solution.\nAdd 500 μL Buffer RPE working solution to the column and centrifuge for 2 min at 14,000 × g at room temperature (around 19°C–23°C) to wash the column.\nOptional: Place the column into a new 2 mL collection tube and centrifuge at 8,000 × g for 1 min at room temperature (around 19°C–23°C) to completely remove Buffer RPE.\nPlace the RNeasy spin column into a new 1.5 mL collection tube. Add 30 μL RNase-free water directly to the middle of the spin column membrane without touching the surface and centrifuge for 1 min at 14,000 × g at room temperature (around 19°C–23°C) to elute the RNA.\nDetermine the RNA concentration and check purity of each sample by NanoDrop™ 2000 spectrophotometer at 260 nm and 280 nm.\nNote: NanoDrop can only give information on for example RNA quantity and salt or protein contamination. However, it does not tell anything on RNA integrity. Thus, if available, you could use an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer to get information on RNA quality. See troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1] for examples of degraded and intact RNA analyzed by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.\nPause point: RNA can be stored at −80°C until cDNA preparation. However, it is always recommended to process RNA as soon as possible to avoid degradation.\nLibrary preparation and synthesis\nTiming: 6 days\nNote: In contrast to Khan et al. (2016)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3], who used MiSeq Illumina Primer, we adapted the protocol to the Nextera XT Index Kit v2 Set D from Illumina (#FC-131-2004).",
    "An overview of the different steps of library preparation and overlaps of the different primer sequences can be found in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1547-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Overview of library preparation\nShown are (A) the different steps of library preparation with color coding of the individual parts of the primers as well as (B) exemplary sequences of primer compositions for index read 1 and 2.\nFirst-strand cDNA synthesis (day 1; Timing: 2 h). cDNA synthesis was performed using the SCRIPTUM FIRST cDNA synthesis kit from Bio&Sell (#BS 48.100) using immunoglobulin specific primers (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] and Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1547-Mmc1.xlsx]) according to manufacturer’s instructions. By including IgM and IgA specific primer additionally to the primers used by Khan et al. (2016)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] discrimination of IgG1/2, IgG3, IgM and IgA VDJ recombination is possible.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1547-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Primers used for cDNA Synthesis (Stock concentration: 100 μM)\nPartial Illumina Adapter (blue), reverse unique molecular identifier (red), spacer (yellow) and Ig-specific sequences (black) are highlighted. Nucleotides according to IUPAC nomenclature (1985), where “H” stands for everything except guanine and “N” for any base (not a gap). See also Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1547-Mmc1.xlsx].\nCritical: Perform all steps on ice.\nMix appropriate amounts of the four cDNA primers TAK_402, TAK_403, TAK_IgM and TAK_IgA (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] and Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1547-Mmc1.xlsx]) and dilute 1:5 with nuclease-free water. Each Primer has a final concentration of 5 μM which taken together results in a final concentration of 20 μM for the primer mix. For example, for 100 μL of cDNA primer mix take 5 μL of each primer (TAK_402, TAK_403, TAK_IgM and TAK_IgA; stock concentration: 100 μM) and add 80 μL of nuclease-free water to receive a 20 μM stock concentration of cDNA primer mix.\nNote: cDNA primer mix can be stored at −20°C.",
    "Prepare reverse transcription reaction mix as in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for each sample in a nuclease-free microcentrifuge tube, mix properly and keep on ice before use.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1547_1.csv\naAccording to the manufacturer’s protocol, the amount of starting material can vary from 1 pg - 5 μg of total RNA. Therefore, also lower RNA amounts are sufficient. For example, we have successfully used about 0.1–0.3 μg of RNA.\nNote: It is recommended to mix RNase-free water, total RNA and primers first before adding the other components.\nIncubate mixture at 42°C for 10 min first and then at 50°C for 60 min.\nShort-spin reaction tubes.\nPause point: cDNA can be stored at −20°C until further use.\nPCR purification (day 1; Timing: 30 min). SPRI paramagnetic bead cleanup was performed using Agencourt AMPure XP from Beckman and Coulter (#A63881) using manufacturer’s instruction with minor adaptions. Please refer to Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] for a rapid overview of this step.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1547-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Workflow for PCR purification\nNote: Purification steps are recommended to remove contaminants like dNTPs, salts, primers, or primer dimers that might interfere with further procedure.\nIf cDNA has been stored at −20°C thaw samples.\nCarefully resuspend AMPure XP by shaking the bottle to obtain a homogeneous suspension.\nAdd 20 μL of AMPure XP per 20 μL of sample and mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down (do not vortex).\nIncubate 5 min at room temperature (around 19°C–23°C).\nPlace 1.5 mL tube in a magnetic bead separator and incubate for 2 min at room temperature (around 19°C–23°C) until solution turns clear and beads are stuck to the side close to the magnet.\nCarefully remove the supernatant. See Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] for exemplary pictures of the former steps.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1547-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

    "(A–C) (A) PCR product is (B) mixed thoroughly with AMPure XP beads and incubated for 5 min at room temperature (around 19°C–23°C) until (C) solution turns clear and beads are stuck to the side close to the magnet.\n(D) Afterwards supernatant is carefully removed without disturbing the beads.\nCritical: Do not remove the supernatant completely but maintain ∼5 μL of fluid in the tube as the beads can easily slide down at this time point (see troubleshooting problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.3]).\nAdd 200 μL freshly prepared 70% ethanol on the beads in the tube and incubate for 30 s at room temperature (around 19°C–23°C).\nRemove the supernatant completely and repeat ethanol-washing step to remove remaining contaminants.\nNote: A dry time of a couple of minutes under the fume hood is optional to ensure that all traces of ethanol are removed. For example, we dried the samples between 5–10 min until ethanol was completely evaporated. Since drying times may vary between experiments samples should be monitored closely to avoid overdrying of the beads.\nRemove the tube from the magnetic bead separator and add 40 μL elution buffer (Buffer EB from Qiagen, #19086).\nResuspend by pipetting up and down 10 times.\nIncubate 2 min at room temperature (around 19°C–23°C).\nPlace 1.5 mL tube in a magnetic bead separator and incubate for 1 min at room temperature (around 19°C–23°C) until beads are separated from the solution.\nTransfer the eluate to a new tube.\nPause point: cDNA can be stored at −20°C until further use.\nMultiplex PCR (day 2; Timing: 1 h). This step was performed using the KAPA HIFI HotStart Uracil+ ReadyMix from KAPA Biosystems (#KK2801) with minor adaptions to manufacturer`s instructions.",
    "Critical: KAPA HiFi HotStart Uracil+ reactions must be set up on ice since the high proofreading activity of the enzyme will result in rapid primer degradation at room temperature (around 19°C–23°C).\nCritical: KAPA HiFi HotStart Uracil+ ReadyMix contains isostabilizers and may not freeze solidly, even when stored at −15°C to −25°C. This will not affect the shelf life of the product. Nevertheless, always ensure that the product has been fully thawed and mixed before use.\nPrepare appropriate amount of Multiplex Primer Mix containing the 15 primers TAK_562, TAK_564, TAK_568, TAK_575, TAK_582 - TAK_591, TAK_612 (see Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6] and Table S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1547-Mmc2.xlsx]), dilute 1:8 with nuclease-free water and keep on ice before use. Each Primer has a final concentration of 0.833 μM which taken together results in a final concentration of 12.5 μM for the primer mix. For example, for 120 μL of Multiplex Primer Mix take 1 μL of each primer (TAK_562, TAK_564, TAK_568, TAK_575, TAK_582 - TAK_591, TAK_612; stock concentration: 100 μM) and add 105 μL of nuclease-free water to receive a 12.5 μM stock concentration of Multiplex Primer Mix.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1547-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

For a high-resolution repertoire analysis aim for 0.5–1 Mio raw reads per sample. Use the MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 (MS-102-3003 600-cycle) according to the Illumina protocol for Miseq.\nNote: 20% PhiX was used according to Illumina recommendations to prevent sequencing error due to low sample complexity in antibody constant regions. In an additional step we used PhiX content after sequencing for a sample independent quality control for the Illumina workflow (see data processing[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.4] step 24).",

Time-consuming steps are paired-end merging (takes some min/sample) the IMGT HighV-QUEST web analysis (takes some hours/days for all samples depending on server workload) and the ARGalaxy pipeline (takes some min/sample).\nThe following steps include the analysis from the Illumina output after demultiplexing (FASTQ) to the result visualizations as well as necessary quality control steps to ensure a successful workflow. Additionally to Khan et al.

This is required for UMI (unique molecular identifier) error correction and IMGT HighV-QUEST compatibility.\nInput:    M1_quality-pass.fastq\nOutput:  M1_quality-pass.fasta\n>sed -n '1∼4s/ˆ@/>/p;2∼4p' M1_quality-pass.fastq > M1_quality-pass.fasta",
    "Note: The same results can be achieved by forcing presto to output FASTA files with the flag --fasta. This is not recommended as it will prevent QC after merging.\nUMI (unique molecular identifier) error correction and isotype filtering.\nCritical: The script only works with the primer design described in this protocol.\nUMI correction is achieved with a perl script available at GitHub (Schaefer, 2022a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) and Zenodo (Schaefer, 2022b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nPCR and sequencing errors are corrected by UMI pattern matching and selecting reads containing valid UMIs. Reads with matching UMIs are corrected to the most abundant read per UMI. To exclude quantitative bias introduced during Multiplex PCR reads are normalized to unique mRNA sequences. Reads shorter than 50 nucleotides are filtered for additional quality control. For problems during this step see troubleshooting problem 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.13].\nInput: M1_quality-pass.fasta\nOutput: The script creates a folder containing a log file with primer and UMI information as well as new FASTA files with corrected sequences for all reads and primer defined isotypes.\n>perl umify_normalized_iso.pl M1_quality-pass.fasta\nNote: Depending on the workflow all reads or specific isotypes can be selected for further analysis.\nIMGT analysis/annotation.\nUMI corrected FASTA files are uploaded to the IMGT HighV-QUEST web service for further analysis. The service takes a FASTA file and provides an archive file (.txz) containing immune receptor annotation and mutational analysis for the immune repertoire as tabular files.\nUpload: http://www.imgt.org/HighV-QUEST/home.action[href=http://www.imgt.org/HighV-QUEST/home.action]\nInput:Sample.fasta (repertoire or isotype specific)\nOutput:Archive file Sample.txz containing the following tabular files:\nSummary (always provided in a spreadsheet and in a zip archive)\nIMGT-gapped-nt-sequences\nnt-sequences\nIMGT-gapped-AA-sequences\nAA-sequences\nJunction\nV-REGION-mutation-and-AA-change-table\nV-REGION-nt-mutation-statistics\nV-REGION-AA-change-statistics\nV-REGION-mutation-hotspots\nParameters (always provided in a spreadsheet and in a zip archive)\nscFv (for advanced functionalities, analysis of single chain fragment variable (scFv), only)",
    "Note: IMGT HighV-QUEST has no batch mode. For huge collections of samples, we recommend the immcantation framework (see Alternatives).\nARGalaxy analysis.\nIMGT archives are further processed with the ARGalaxy pipeline or as docker image for local use.\nAntigen Receptor Galaxy (ARGalaxy) is an online tool for the analysis and visualization of immune receptor sequencing data. The tool contains among basic utilities to load and concatenate IMGT archive files pipelines to create summary statistics and publication-ready graphics. The tool includes a pipeline to analyze immune repertoires (immune repertoire pipeline) and an additional pipeline to analyze class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation data (CSR and SHM pipeline).\nCritical: ARGalaxy depends on the output format of IMGT HighV-QUEST for full functionality. If the annotation was conducted with the immcantation framework or other tools, we recommend continuing with alternative workflows (see Alternatives).\nNote: Docker download page: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/[href=https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/]\nInput: Sample.txz archive obtained from IMGT HighV-QUEST\nUpload Data:      Get Data\n                  +Upload File from your computer\nAnalysis:          ARGalaxy Pipelines\n                  +Immune Repertoire pipeline\n                  +SHM & CSR pipeline\nOutput:           The data is available inside the Galaxy GUI or can be downloaded as archive           containing HTML summaries, summary tables and picture files.\n>docker pull quay.io/erasmusmc_bioinformatics/argalaxy\n>docker run -p 8080:80\nquay.io/erasmusmc_bioinformatics/argalaxy\n#Visit localhost:8080 in a webbrowser to start using\n#ARGalaxy.\n#If you don't want to lose your data when restarting the\n#Docker image, add the -v flag to create a local mountpoint:\n>docker run -p 8080:80 -v /path/to/local/dir/:/export/\nargalaxy:latest\nThe graphical interface of locally deployed ARGalaxy servers can be accessed via any browser at: localhost:8080.\nCritical: The ID field in the Immune Repertoire pipeline is used as description in output graphics and should be named accordingly.\nAlternatives: An alternative analysis method to the IMGT/ARGalaxy workflow is the immcantation framework (Gupta et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), which we recommend using as docker image."
