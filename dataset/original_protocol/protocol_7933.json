  "procedures": [
    "The experiments were performed following the recommendations of the Declarations of Helsinki and Tokyo and the Guidelines for the Use of Experimental Animals of the European Community. The experiments were approved by the Animal Care Committee of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. A protocol timeline is illustrated in Figure 1.\n1. Surgical procedures and fluid percussion TBI\nSelect male and female adult Sprague-Dawley rats, housed at a room temperature of 22 ± 1 °C, and humidity of 40%-60%, with 12-12 h light-dark cycles.\nProvide food as chow and water ad libitum. Perform experiments between morning hours, i.e., 6:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m.\nPerform a baseline neurological assessment for both the control and TBI groups prior to the start of the experiment (see section 2 below).\nAnesthetize the rats with inhaled 4% isoflurane for induction and 1.5% for maintenance of anesthesia. Ensure that rat is immobilized by testing pedal reflex or movement in response to an irritant.\n\t​NOTE: Use a continuous isoflurane administration system for anesthesia. Perform all procedures in aseptic conditions.\nPerform parasagittal fluid-percussion injury as previously described21,22.\nSubcutaneously inject 0.2 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine along the prospective incision site, prior to incision. ransfer the rat to the recovery room and continue monitoring the neurological (e.g., paralysis), respiratory (e.g., respiratory arrest) and cardiovascular state (e.g., decreases in soft tissue perfusion, changes in color of pupils, and bradycardia) for 24 h. Prior to emergence from anesthesia, administer 0.01 - 0.05 mg/kg intramuscular buprenorphine as postoperative analgesia. Repeat doses every 6 - 12 h for at least 48 h.\n2. Evaluation of Neurological Severity Score (NSS)",
    "NOTE: Assessment of neurological deficit was performed and graded using an NSS, as previously described23,24. The maximum score of alteration in motor function and behavior is 24 points. A score of 0 indicates an intact neurological status and 24 indicates severe neurological dysfunction, as previously described24.\nTest the rat's inability to leave a circle (50 cm in diameter) when placed in its center. Perform this task three times, with each session lasting 30 min, 60 min, and more than 60 min each.\n\tNOTE: If picking up rats by the tail, hold the base of the tail.\nTest the rat for a loss of righting reflex.\n\t\nPlace the animal on its back in the palm of the researcher's hand. Give a score of 1 if the animal is able to right itself25 (standing on all four paws).\nTest the rat for hemiplegia, the inability of the rat to resist forced positioning.\nRaise the rat by its tail to test the reflexive bending of the hindlimb.\nPut the rat on the floor to test its ability to walk straight.\nPerform testing for three reflexive behaviors: the pinna reflex, the corneal reflex, and the startle reflex.\n\t\nFor the pinna reflex, perform light tactile stimulation to test ear retraction as previously described25.\nTo test the corneal reflex, monitor blink response when applying a soft stick lightly to the eye and measure on a scale of 0 (no response) to triple eye blink (3), as previously described25.\nFor the startle reflex, drag a pen across the top of the wire cage and record response with a scale from 0 (no response) to 3 (1 cm jump or more), as previously described25.",
    "Grade the rat based on loss of seeking behavior and prostration (not moving their whiskers, sniffing, or running after being transferred to a new environment)24.\nTest limb reflexes for the placement on the left and right forelimbs, and then the left and right hindlimbs.\nAnalyze functionality via the beam balancing task with a beam that is 1.5 cm wide. Perform the test for sessions lasting 20 seconds, 40 seconds, and more than 60 seconds.\nRun the beam walking test with three different beams: 8.5 cm wide, 5 cm wide, and 2.5 cm wide.\n3. Preparing for the metric task\nEquipment\n\t\nPlace a black circular platform 200 cm in diameter and 1 cm thick on a table. The height of the table should be 80 cm above the floor.\nEstablish two different objects in the center of circular platform 68 cm away from each other.\n\t\tNOTE: In this experiment, two glass bottles were used for objects, one round bottle with a height of 13.5 cm and another faceted bottle with a height of 20 cm. Fill bottles with water to ensure stability.\nPrepare a camera and install the required computer software for capturing, saving, and processing data. Install the camera at a height of 290 cm from the floor.\n\t\tNOTE: The distance between the platform and camera depends on the camera specifications. The camera frame should cover the entire area of the arena in which the test is being conducted. The distance for our experiment between the platform and the camera was 210 cm.\nHabituation\n\t\nOn the day before the task, habituate the rat to the new environment for 10 min by placing on the arena without video recording.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not perform the neurological tasks and the metric task on the same day.",
    "NOTE: Perform metric tests in a red light area.\n4. Performing the metric task\nNOTE: Performing the metric task consists of two periods: 1) habituation (15 min) and 2) test (5 min) period.\nHabituation period\n\t\nEstablish two different objects in the center of the circular platform 68 cm away from each other.\nPlace the rat on the end of the platform equidistant from the objects for a 15 min period, and record the video.\nRemove the rat from the platform and place in an individual cage for 5 min.\nClean the platform with 5%-10% alcohol.\n\t\t​NOTE: Up to 70% alcohol may be used to clean the platform in well-ventilated areas.\nTest period\n\t\nReduce the distance between objects to 34 cm.\nPlace the rat on the platform for 5 min and record the rat's exploration activity on video.\nClean the platform with 5%-10% alcohol.\n5. Data analysis\nNOTE: Data analysis is performed by video tracking software specifically designed for animal behavior studies that automatically records animal activity and movement (see Table of Materials). This software automates a range of behavioral variables, including mobility, activity, and explorative behavior.\nPrior to analyzing the video files, insert the software hardware key. Start the video tracking software and open preset Template.\nIn the Setup section, verify settings as follows: Arena, Trial Control, and Detecting Settings (see Figure 2a) .\n\tNOTE: For this experiment, parameters for the exploration area are defined as 6 cm around the object of interest. The time the rat entered into this area was measured.\nAfter verifying the settings, duplicate and rename them.\nOn the general screen of the program, Grab Background by right clicking on the mouse.\nSelect a video file for the background image. In the Browse menu, select the location of the video file.",
    "Capture the image and mark the investigated areas and zones, calibrating the image for analysis. Perform the same steps for Trial Control and Detecting Settings.\nIn the general menu, select Trial List and download the list of video files for analysis.\nAdd the videos and indicate the location with the required settings.\nSelect acquisition and Start Trial (see Figure 2b,c). Export all data as Excel files (see Figure 2d).\n\tNOTE: Perform all calculations for the habituation and test periods. Metric task assessment is prepared with an advanced template.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
