    "The protocol described here was approved by the institutional review boards of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n1. Subject Selection\nPatient selection for research protocol.\n\t\nIdentify patients with active epilepsy (seizures within the past year) or a history of remote epilepsy (prior seizures, but with no seizures in the past five years either on or off medication) and periventricular nodular heterotopia on structural brain imaging.\nExclude patients without any history of seizures. Also exclude patients with alternative possible etiologies for seizures (e.g., a history of traumatic brain injury, stroke, meningoencephalitis) or with EEG findings consistent with an alternative diagnosis (e.g., idiopathic generalized epilepsy, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy).\nExclude patients with additional neurologic or psychiatric disease, or with any other unstable medical condition. Also exclude patients with a history of prior brain surgery, inability to tolerate MRI, recent illicit substance or heavy alcohol use, or a specific MRI46 or TMS47 contraindication.\nHealthy control subject selection.\n\t\nFor each PNH patient (in our prior published study37, 8 patients, ages 20 - 43 years mean 30.25; 3 male, 5 female), identify an age- and gender-matched healthy control.\nExclude subjects with any ongoing neurologic or psychiatric disease or on psychoactive medications, any other unstable medical condition, a history of prior brain surgery, inability to tolerate MRI, illicit substance or heavy alcohol use, or any other specific MRI or TMS contraindication.\n2. Generating the Stimulation Targets",
    "Using a 3T MRI system, acquire high-resolution structural whole-brain slices using a T1-weighted sequence. Use the following acquisition parameters: 128 slices per slab, a 256 x 256 matrix, field of view (FOV) 256 mm, slice thickness 1.33 mm with 0.63 mm interslice gap, voxel size 1 x 1 x 1.33 mm3, repetition time (TR) 2,530 msec, inversion time 1,100 msec, echo time (TE) 3.39 msec, flip angle 7°.\nUsing a 3T MRI system, acquire resting-state functional images using an echo-planar sequence sensitive to blood-oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast. While performing this scan instruct the patients to rest quietly with eyes open without performing any specific task. Use the following acquisition parameters: FOV 256 mm, voxel size 2.0 x 2.0 x 2.0 mm, TR 6,000 msec, TE 30 msec, flip angle 90°, acquisition time 6.4 min.\nUsing MRICroN software44, identify each discrete region of nodular heterotopia (either each individual nodule or an inseparable contiguous cluster of nodules) 46. Use the Pen tool to manually outline heterotopia regions of interest (ROIs), slice by slice in the axial plane on T1-weighted structural images.\nUse the CONN functional connectivity software toolbox48,49 to perform four sequential steps in resting-state functional data processing: Setup, Preprocessing, Analysis, and Results.\n\t\nFor Setup, use menu choices to start a new project and enter basic experiment information. Load the functional images, realigned and co-registered to the anatomic images for each subject.\nLoad the structural images. Load heterotopia ROI files created in step 2.3. Enter details of the experimental condition; since this is resting-state, enter a single condition with onset 0 seconds and duration equal to the complete duration of each session. The toolbox will extract the heterotopia ROI BOLD time-series. Inspect for possible inconsistencies.",
    "For Preprocessing, confounding sources of BOLD variation include respiratory-induced modulations of the main magnetic field and cardiac pulsations, as well as subject motion. Remove confounders via the integrated principal component-based method that analyzes time-series data from regions unlikely to be associated with neural activity, such as ventricles and large vessels, to identify physiological noise processes50. Preview the total variance explained by each of the possible confounding sources. Apply a band-pass frequency filter (0.01 Hz < f < 0.1 Hz) and Gaussian smoothing (6 mm full width at half-maximum).\n\t\tNOTE: The toolbox will by default identify sources of possible confounders, including BOLD signal from the white matter and cerebrospinal fluid and realignment parameters (subject motion).\nFor Analysis and Results, identify the sources of interest as the heterotopia ROIs. Preview the connectivity measure of correlation (rather than regression), and display using threshold values for correlation coefficients.\n\t\t\nFor each subject, create seed-to-voxel connectivity maps utilizing each discrete region of heterotopic gray matter as a seed ROI, demonstrating the correlation between the average BOLD signal time series of the ROI and every other brain voxel.\nPerform second-level analyses for between-subject or between-source contrasts (optional). Display the results using height (voxel-level) and extent (cluster-level) thresholds; uncorrected and false discovery rate-corrected p-values are shown.\nUse MRICroN software to manually outline two targets of interest, a connected target and a non-connected target, for TMS, using the Pen tool43. Using the \"Overlay\" function superimpose the functional connectivity maps created above onto the structural images for each subject.",
    "Ensure that the target region is a region of cortex that has significant functional connectivity to the gray matter heterotopia as described above. Ensure that the non-connected target is a similar size region that does not demonstrate significant functional connectivity to any heterotopia ROI, and is located at least 2.5 cm away from the connected target on the cortical surface to minimize the risk of neighborhood stimulation effects during TMS.\nChoose targets such that the likelihood of large TMS-induced artifacts is small51. Specifically, avoid selecting targets in the lateral temporal or frontopolar regions, as these are likely to produce large muscle contraction and/or eye movement artifacts that can obscure the early TMS-EEG signal51. Save the outlined targets as new target ROIs.\nDetermine the MNI coordinates for each target ROI in each subject. Then use these coordinates to identify the equivalent two target sites in each subject's matched healthy control subject.\n3. TMS-EEG Experimental Setup\nUpload structural scans (typically high-resolution T1-weighted 3D volumetric images) into the neuronavigation system.\nUsing the neuronavigation software, mark the desired targets on the images. Also mark external anatomic markers (the nasion, bilateral tragus) that will be used for coregistration and neuronavigation during the stimulation session. If using an EEG cap with rotatable electrodes and electrode wires, orient wires perpendicular to the long axis of the TMS coil52.\nContact the subject prior to the experimental session to remind him or her not to use conditioners or other hair products (shampoo is acceptable) on the day of the TMS-EEG session, to avoid alcoholic drinks the evening prior to the TMS-EEG session, and to drink his or her usual daily caffeine consumption prior to the TMS session.\n4. Experimental Session",
    "Confirm that the subject passes TMS safety criteria, ideally via a structured questionnaire53. Confirm that the subject did not consume alcoholic beverages the prior night, did not drink significantly more or less than his or her usual daily caffeine consumption, did not consume over-the-counter sleep aids that alter cortical excitability (such as diphenhydramine) the prior night, and received a typical night's sleep (as sleep deprivation can increase cortical excitability54).\nAsk the subject to sit in a comfortable chair.\nMount the EEG cap on the subject and prepare the electrodes.\n\t\nMeasure the subject's head and select an EEG cap of appropriate size to help enable low electrode impedances.\nThoroughly clean the skin underneath each electrode using a cotton-tip applicator and alcohol.\nAdd conductive gel to each electrode. Do not add too much gel that it leaks between electrodes, as that may create a bridge and lead to common signal between different electrodes.\nIf necessary, to ensure good contact between the scalp, the gel and the electrode, try pressing down on each electrode after adding the gel. To minimize charging artifacts, ensure that the gel does not spread outside the electrode holder. Homogeneously reduced the conductance levels to minimize recording artifacts.\nPlace the reference and ground electrodes as far from the stimulation coil as possible to minimize the possibility of TMS-induced electrode artifact contaminating the entire recording. It is preferable to place these electrodes above bony structures, in presumably \"inactive\" zones with minimal cortical activity.",
    "NOTE: Even in studies for which the target locations are variable, frontopolar regions are unlikely to be selected as targets because TMS to these regions can result in large eye movements, contraction of the frontalis and facial muscles51, and, frequently, scalp pain and headache; consequently, the TMS-EEG signal during stimulation of these regions is often obscured by large artifacts.\nSince these regions are thus unlikely to be chosen as targets for stimulation, use the forehead for placement of the reference and ground electrodes. Place them within a few centimeters of each other to minimize common mode noise.\n\t\tNOTE: In situations where all the stimulation targets are in one hemisphere, the contralateral mastoid would be another option.\nCheck electrode impedances as follows; plug the EEG output cables into the \"impedance\" jack of the EEG recording system, then press the \"measure impedances\" button on the EEG system. Ensure that the electrode impedance is not greater than 5 kΩ.\nPrepare the EMG electrodes on the contralateral hand (use first dorsal interosseous or abductor pollicis brevis muscles; utilize the same muscle across subjects in a single study).\nGive the subject earplugs to minimize risk of hearing loss and tinnitus.\n\tNOTE: Another option would be to utilize earphones playing white noise or colored noise (with spectral features matching those of the TMS click) throughout the recording process, at a volume sufficient to mask the auditory click produced by TMS; this would have the added benefit of minimizing the potential confound of TMS-induced auditory evoked potentials10,55. Of note, a thin layer of foam between the coil and scalp is also necessary to minimizing the auditory evoked potential.\nPlace the infrared detectors on the subject's head, ensuring that the detectors are placed in a way to minimize risk of movement during the experimental session.",
    "Coregister the subject's head with the MRI images by identifying the location of the pre-selected external anatomic fiducial markers (section 3.2) on the subject using the pointer that is included with the neuronavigation equipment.\nFamiliarize the subject with stimulation by applying a pulse elsewhere (e.g., the subject's arm), or by applying a low-intensity stimulation pulse (e.g., 5% max stimulator output) to the scalp.\nDetermine the resting motor threshold (the minimum intensity that produces a motor-evoked potential at least 50 µV in size on 5/10 trials). One such method, the relative frequency method56, is as follows.\n\t\nDetermine the location of the subject's motor cortex on the hemisphere ipsilateral to the fMRI connectivity-based targets. When using neuronavigation, this is generally in the region of the \"Omega\" in the precentral gyrus. Angle the coil perpendicular to the gyrus, with the handle pointing occipitally.\nBegin stimulation at an intensity that is expected to be subthreshold (e.g., 35% maximum stimulator output).\nIncrease stimulation intensity in steps of 5% max stimulator output until TMS consistently evokes MEPs with amplitudes > 50 µV in each trial.\nThen decrease stimulation intensity in steps of 1% maximum stimulator output until less than 5 positive responses out of 10 are recorded.\n\t\tNOTE: This stimulation intensity plus 1 is defined as motor threshold. Alternatively, use adaptive threshold techniques57 to identify motor threshold with fewer stimuli.\nFor stimulation of the target areas, set the TMS intensity to the desired value (e.g., 120% resting motor threshold).",
    "NOTE: However, in cases where there are significant regional variations in scalp-cortex distance (e.g., in patients with frontal lobe atrophy), such a technique may result in subthreshold stimulation. Alternatively, with appropriate neuronavigation systems capable of performing online estimations of the induced electric field, the intensity of the stimulation can also be set at a specific amplitude of the calculated induced electric field (in V/m) on the cortical surface58.\nApply single pulses of TMS to each of the target regions using the neuronavigation software, with a variable interval between pulses to minimize cortical plasticity and subject expectancy effects (e.g., every 4 - 6 sec, with an interval of at least 3 sec to avoid cumulative effects59). To maximize consistency, angle the coil perpendicularly to the long axis of the underlying gyrus, with the handle pointed posterolaterally.\n5. EEG Data Pre-processing and Analysis\nNOTE: TMS-EEG data usually contains large stimulation-related artifacts, particularly when stimulating away from the midline/vertex or with high stimulation intensities, and significant preprocessing may be necessary to obtain clean analyzable data. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is one method that has been utilized for removal of TMS artifacts, and can be applied using publicly available toolboxes (e.g., EEGLAB45) on the MATLAB platform. One validated approach60 is as follows, describing the analysis of data collected using the Eximia EEG system:\nImport the data into EEGLAB\n\t\nClick on \"File\", \"Import data\", \"Using EEGLAB functions and plugins\", \"From EDF / EDF+ / GDF files (BIOSIG toolbox)\".\nExtract event times\n\t\nClick \"File\", \"Import event info\", \"From data channel\". Fill in \"Event channel\" 1, \"Preprocessing transform (data = 'X')\" X > 0.1, \"Transition length (1 = perfect edges) 0. Make sure \"Delete event channel(s)?\" and \"Delete old events, if any?\" checkboxes are checked.",
    "Segment the data into epochs centered around the TMS pulse, from 1 sec before the pulse to 2 sec after. To do this, select \"Tools\", \"Extract Epochs\". If the TMS pulse is the only event type, \"Time-locking event type(s)\" field can be left blank. For \"Epoch limits [start, end] in seconds\" enter [-1 2].\nReview EEG data visually (select \"Plot\", \"Channel data (scroll)\".) Remove bad channels (e.g., channels with no signal, or with continuous excessive artifact). To do this, click \"Edit\", \"Select data\". In the \"Channel range\" field, enter the number(s) of the channel to be deleted (or click on the toggle box to the right and select the channels by name, then press \"OK\"), make sure the \"on->remove these\" checkbox is checked, and then press \"Ok\".\nSet the potentials in all electrodes to zero from the time of the pulse until the EEG signal has returned to approximately one order of magnitude of the neural signal (e.g., by cutting out data larger than 150 µV), or any later fixed time point (e.g., 40 msec) to ensure that the large TMS artifacts do not distort the ICA separation.61 This step will need to scripted in Matlab.\nPerform an initial round of ICA, and remove the 1 - 2 components representing the large TMS-induced initial muscle activation.\n\t\nRun ICA using the FastICA method with the \"symmetric approach\" and the \"tanh\" contrast function using the following command line: \"EEG = pop_runica(EEG,'icatype','fastica', 'approach', 'symm', 'g', 'tanh');\".\n\t\tNOTE: Run ICA separately for each site, as the artifact produced by stimulation will vary as a function of stimulation site.",
    "Identify components consistent with TMS artifact by selecting \"Tools\", \"Reject data using ICA\", \"Remove components by map\". The topographic maps of all the ICA components will then be plotted. Click on the number for each component to plot component details (a larger map of the topographic distribution, the activity profile across trials, and the frequency spectrum).\n\t\tNOTE: The TMS pulse artifact components (typically 1 - 2) can be recognized by the dipolar topographic plot localized to the site of stimulation, the extremely large amplitude of the component activation immediately after the pulse, and the subsequent smooth exponential decay.\nDelete the artifactual components by selecting \"Tools\", \"Remove components\", and entering the relevant component numbers in the field for \"Component(s) to remove from data\". In the \"Confirmation\" box that pops up, press \"Accept\" after reviewing the ERPs that result after deletion of the selected component (press \"Plot ERPs\") and after reviewing single-trial effects (press \"Plot single trials\"). NOTE: This step should be completed prior to filtering to minimize any filter artifacts from the TMS-induced muscle artifact, which can often be several millivolts.\nInterpolate the missing data (during the zero-padded time period). This step will need to be done using a Matlab script.\nBandpass and/or notch filter the data (optional; or could be done at a later time point, e.g., after second round of ICA artifact removal).\n\tNOTE: If the high-amplitude TMS-artifact has not been adequately removed, the temporal smoothing effect of a high-pass filter can lead to temporal dispersion of artifact. Furthermore, the passband rippling produced by low-pass filters can lead to prominent ringing artifact in the \"clean\" portion of the resulting filtered EEG signal.\nRe-reference to Average reference (optional, or could be done at a later time point, e.g., after interpolation of missing channels).",
    "Remove individual epochs with large-amplitude artifacts, significant muscle activity, or other major artifacts.\n\t\nFor semi-automated artifact rejection, select \"Tools\", \"Reject data epochs\", \"Reject data (all methods)\".\nUnder \"Find improbable data\" enter 3.5 in the field for \"Single-channel limit (std. dev.) and 3 in the field for \"All channels limit (std. dev.)\", then press the \"Calculate\" button immediately below. This identifies epochs that contain improbable data based on the distribution of values across data epochs.\nUnder \"Find abnormal distributions\", enter 5 in the field for \"Single-channel limit (std. dev.)\" and 3 in the field for \"All channels limit (std. dev.)\", then press the \"Calculate\" button immediately below. This identifies epochs as containing artifacts based on the kurtosis of the data.\nTo reject epochs with abnormally high or low values, under \"Find abnormal values\", enter 100 in the field for \"Upper limit(s) (uV)\" and -100 in the field for \"Lower limit(s) (uV)\" (although different limits may be needed in children, in whom EEG amplitudes are usually higher). Enter electrode numbers to apply voltage thresholding in the field marked \"Electrode(s)\"; to avoid rejecting all epochs with eye blinks, do not include frontopolar (and/or EOG) channels. Then press \"Calc / Plot.\".\nScroll through marked epochs, and unmark epochs that do NOT contain artifacts by right-clicking on the epoch. Mark additional epochs that contain significant artifacts by left-clicking on the epoch. After confirming that all epochs containing artifacts are marked, click \"UPDATE MARKS\" button.\nTo save which epochs are marked for deletion, click \"Close (keep marks)\" and then save dataset (\"File\", \"Save current dataset as\").\n\t\t\nTo then delete the relevant epochs, select \"Tools\", \"Reject data epochs\", \"Reject marked epochs\". Click \"Yes\" on subsequent confirmation dialogue box. Save resulting dataset.",
    "Perform a second round of ICA, and remove components corresponding to decay artifacts, blink artifacts, muscle artifacts, and electrode noise artifacts.\n\tNOTE: Removal of components consistent with auditory-evoked potentials may be considered, although these components may also contain neural evoked components directly related to the stimulation pulse (which also have peaks at similar time points). A better option that would minimize TMS-evoked potentials induced by the TMS \"click\", and thus eliminate the need for ICA-based removal, would be to perform noise masking as described in section 4.5 above, if tolerable by the subjects.\n\t\nRun ICA using the FastICA method with the \"symmetric approach\" and the \"tanh\" contrast function, as described in 5.6.1 above.\nEvaluate component properties as described in 5.6.2 above.\nMark components consistent with residual TMS decay artifacts62.\n\t\tNOTE: Identify this based on timing (maximal immediately after the pulse), morphology (a slow decay with overshoot, then slow recovery over tens to hundreds of milliseconds) and location (near the stimulation site). Also, ICA components can be organized in descending order of explained variance; as the TMS artifact is quite large, it is typically represented in the first components, and typically represent no more than 1 - 5 components.\nUsing the ADJUST plugin62 for EEGLAB, mark components consistent with blink artifacts.\n\t\tNOTE: Identify this based on location (maximal frontopolar), timecourse (long periods with relatively minimal activity, followed by short periods of intense activation), spectra (high power at low frequencies) and morphology (triphasic).\nMark components consistent with muscle artifact62.\n\t\tNOTE: Identify this based on spectral features (significant power at beta frequencies and above), temporal distribution (very irregular / jagged), spatial distribution (maximal along the scalp periphery) and time-domain activity (spiky).",
    "Mark components consistent with channel noise based on spatial distribution (isolated to 1 or 2 channels) and temporal distribution (often very peaky, high activity on few trials, or very slow large amplitude fluctuations) using the ADJUST plugin62 for EEGLAB.\nRemove marked components as in 5.6.4 above. Interpolate missing channels and perform subsequent analyses upon this data.\n\t\tNOTE: Caution is required when interpolating channels. In particular, if a substantial proportion (e.g., 10%) of channels or if adjacent channels are interpolated, the resulting dataset may be unreliable, particularly if the underlying brain activity has a high spatial frequency.\nLoad another dataset with all desired channels into EEGLAB. Then bring the dataset that you wish to perform the interpolation on to the foreground by selecting \"Datasets\", and then clicking on the relevant dataset.\nSelect \"Tools\", \"Interpolate electrodes\". In the resulting dataset, select \"Use all channels from other dataset\". For \"Interpolation method\", select \"Spherical\" and then press \"Ok\".\n6. Assess for Evidence of Cortical Hyperexcitability\nCalculate the global mean field potential (GMFP)63 for each subject and stimulation site as a function of time, using the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53727/53727eq1.jpg\n\twhere K is the number of electrodes, Vi(t) is the voltage measured at electrode i at time t, and Vmean(t) is the mean voltage across electrodes at time t.\nSegment the data into \"early\" time periods when TMS-evoked activity is normally present in healthy individuals (e.g., 100 - 225 msec), and late time periods, when abnormal delayed activity may be seen in patients with epilepsy (e.g., 225 - 700 msec). Calculate the area under the curve (AUC) of the GMFP (AUC-GMFP) during each time period.",
    "NOTE: Since the absolute magnitude of the evoked response can vary widely between individuals because of factors independent of cortical physiology (e.g., skull thickness, scalp-cortex distance, individual brain anatomy) that may nonetheless vary between groups (e.g., because patients with epilepsy may be on antiepileptic medications), raw amplitudes are of limited utility in evaluating the TMS-evoked potentials. To isolate whether patients with epilepsy have abnormally increased TMS-evoked activity, normalize the magnitude of the AUC-GMFP during later time periods by the magnitude of the AUC-GMFP during the \"early\" time periods.\nCompare the normalized AUC-GMFP for each epilepsy patient to that obtained by stimulation of the same region in that patient's matched healthy control. A larger value (ratio > 1) in the epilepsy patient indicates that the epilepsy patient has increased excitability.\n7. Source Estimation of Evoked Electrical Activity\nReconstruct the cortical surface for the subject using the Freesurfer64 package.\n\t\nRun command \"Generate FreeSurfer Output\". Run command \"Generate Surfaces\". Run command \"Create Source Space\". Import digitized electrode locations from the neuronavigation software and align electrodes using MNE Analyze software (MNE Version 2.7.0)65,66; if individual electrode locations are not available, data from a subject with a similar approximate head size may suffice.\nRun command \"mne_analyze\".
