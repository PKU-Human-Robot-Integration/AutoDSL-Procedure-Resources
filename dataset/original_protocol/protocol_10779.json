    "1. High-throughput Carbohydrate Synthesis\nPrior to the automated synthesis of dimannoside, a suitably protected sugar donor, typically trichloroacetimidate, and acceptor, mainly an alkenyl fluorous alcohol, are synthesized on the bench-top.\nA program is written for the automated synthesis of dimannoside. A schematic representation of the basic automated procedure is presented in Figure 2. In the program, it is ensured that before the addition of the promoter, the mixture of donor and acceptor is stirred for at least 30 min.\nSolutions of the synthetic donor, acceptor and trimethylsilyltrifluoromethanesulfonate are made in dichloromethane. Toluene and dichloromethane are used most frequently for glycosylation reactions.\nAlso, prepare solutions of reagents for the deprotection of temporary protecting groups in 80% methanol and 100% methanol.\nPrior to the start of the program, ensure that the relative humidity in the room is 30% or lower in the automation chamber. High humidity is detrimental for glycosylation reactions.\nOnce the program is started, the robotic arm transfers the solutions of donor and acceptor into the reaction vial sequentially. Then the mixture is stirred for 30 min.\nNext the robotic arm transfers 0.2 to 0.3 equivalents of trimethylsilyltrifluoromethanesulfonate into the mixture, typically at room temperature although lower temperatures like -20 °C can be attained. The reaction mixture is stirred for 30 min.\nAfter 30 min, the reaction is stopped and a small aliquot removed to monitor the reaction progress. If not complete, the reaction can be continued and ultimately the time required can be modified.\nOnce the reaction is complete, the reaction mixture is transferred to the fluorous solid phase extraction (FSPE) cartridges containing C8F17-modified silica gel for purification.\nThe cartridges are first washed with an 80% methanol-water mixture (8 mL) to get rid of the non-fluorous fraction.",
    "Then the cartridges are washed with 100% methanol to obtain the desired fluorous-tagged product. If additional purification is desired, the machine can be stopped and the reaction product(s) removed for purification by additional means.\nAfter the purification cycle, the robotic arm dispenses sodium methoxide into the reaction vial. The reaction is stirred for 2 hr. If not complete, the reaction can again be continued for a longer period and ultimately the programmed time required can be modified.\nAfter the completion of the reaction, the product is purified by FSPE and then subjected to dissolution in anhydrous toluene followed by evaporation to remove residual water.\nThen the cycle (from step 6 to 13) is repeated till the desired chain length is obtained for the target molecule.\nThe protected product obtained from automation is then further purified and fully characterized by techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Complete deprotection (removal of all remaining protecting groups) of the final target molecule is then completed outside the automation platform as a rule because it usually involves explosive hydrogen gas and palladium. The final deprotection step was carried out on bench-top outside the automation platform. The first step was ozonolysis of the double bond in fluorous tag followed by oxidation of the produced aldehyde to a carboxylic acid. The product was purified by column chromatography. The final step was deprotection of benzyl ether groups by palladium-catalyzed hydrogenation. The product was passed through celite pad to get rid of palladium to get pure final product.\n2. High-throughput Nanoparticle Surface Functionalization",
    "High-throughput polymer synthesis and nanoparticle fabrication is carried out following the same protocol and robotic set up described by Petersen et al19. The copolymer systems used for particle fabrication are based on sebacic acid (SA) and 1,6-bis(para-carboxyphenoxy)hexane (CPH), and 1,8-bis(para-carboxyphenoxy)-3,6-dioxaoctane (CPTEG) and CPH. A schematic representation of the robotic deposition apparatus utilized is presented in Figure 1b.\nFollowing nanoparticle fabrication, the holder containing tubes with the nanoparticle library is reattached to the linear actuator stage.\nFor attachment of carbohydrates to the surface of polyanhydride particles, an amine-carboxylic acid coupling reaction 20 consisting of two consecutive reactions is performed.\nFor the first reaction, the syringe in the first programmable syringe pump is filled with 10 equivalents (eq.) (equivalents of average molar carboxylic acid concentration on particle surface) of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and 10 eq. of ethylenediamine in an aqueous solution, while the syringe in the second programmable syringe pump is loaded with 12 eq. of N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) in aqueous solution.\nUsing the LabVIEW program, reagent suspensions are deposited into the nanoparticle library*.\nNext, each sample is sonicated (30 s at 40 Hz) and the tube holder is detached from the robotic platform.\nNanoparticle suspensions are incubated for 9 h** with constant rotation at 4 °C.\nAfter reaction time is completed, tubes are centrifuged (12000 x g for 5 min) and returned to the robotic station to perform two washing steps.\nFor washing, a syringe remains empty and loaded in the first programmable syringe pump while the syringe in the second syringe pump is filled with cold water. The supernatant in each tube is withdrawn into the empty syringe and the second pump deposits cold water.",
    "Homogenization of nanoparticle suspension is performed as described on step 2.6. Tubes are then centrifuged (12000 x g for 5 min) and a second wash step is performed as described on step 2.9.\nFor the second reaction, two deposition steps are used. In the first deposition step, 12 eq. of EDC are loaded with one pump and 12 eq. of NHS are loaded with the second pump.\nThe second deposition step includes 10 eq. of an specific saccharide on the first and second pumps (i.e., galactose, lactose or di-mannose)*** and a third pump with 10 eq. of glycolic acid (used as control****).\nNanoparticle suspensions is homogenized as described on step 2.6 and incubated for 9 h with constant rotation at 4 °C.\nAfter the time of reaction is completed, a wash step is performed as described in steps 2.8, 2.9 and 2.10.\nThe functionalized nanoparticle library is then placed in a vacuum chamber to dry for at least 2 hr.\nThe functionalized nanoparticles are then characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and a high throughput phenol-sulfuric acid assay to determine the surface composition and concentration of the saccharide respectively. Scanning electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering are utilized to determine particle size, size distribution, and surface charge.\nNotes: *Deposition volumes vary with the mass of nanoparticles contained in each tube.\n**Reaction times for first and second reactions can be changed to adjust the final saccharide concentration.\n***Each saccharide is deposited into test tubes depending on the desired group.\n****For the specific reaction employed in this study for the attachment of carbohydrates, glycolic acid is used as a linker control since deprotected saccharides already have this molecule covalently linked, which allows for further attachment to nanoparticle surface.\n3. Representative Results",
    "The fully protected dimannoside shown in Figure 2 was synthesized using the automation platform. The synthesized compound was characterized by 1H NMR in a VXR 400 MHz spectrometer using CDCl3 as solvent. The NMR spectrum is shown in Figure 3.\nUtilizing the high-throughput nanoparticle fabrication and functionalization of polyanhydride nanoparticles described herein, attachment of dimannose, lactose and galactose has been carried out successfully 10, 11. Using this set up, optimal reaction conditions (i.e., reaction temperature and time) were identified to achieve desired nanoparticle functionalization and morphology. When the reaction was carried out at 4 °C instead of room temperature, a reduction in nanoparticle aggregation was observed by SEM (data not shown). Table 1 shows representative results of the characterization of functionalized 50:50 CPTEG:CPH nanoparticles with either di-mannose or lactose, synthesized at 4 °C. The data indicate a small increase in the average nanoparticle diameter due to the functionalization. While the non-functionalized nanoparticles had a negative zeta potential of approx. -20 mV, the functionalized particles showed a positive zeta potential value, demonstrating successful functionalization of the nanoparticle surface. Lactose and di-mannose are both neutral sugars; however, free amine groups from the ethylene diamine linker utilized to attach the saccharides may be responsible of the positive zeta potential.",
    "Reaction time is another variable that could affect both the final morphology of the nanoparticles and the degree of sugar attachment achieved. By adjusting the reaction time, the final sugar concentration attached to the nanoparticles surface can be controlled as shown in Figure 4A. As expected, the concentration of dimannose on the surface of 50:50 CPTEG:CPH nanoparticles increased with the total time of reaction and reached a maximum after 18 hr. Nanoparticles functionalized with the 24 hr total reaction time were used to evaluate their ability to target CLRs on mouse bone-marrow derived dendritic cells (DCs). Flow cytometry was used to evaluate the expression of two CL receptors (i.e., CIRE (CD209, DC-SIGN) and mannose receptor (CD206)) after stimulation with non-functionalized, and lactose and di-mannose functionalized nanoparticles (Figure 4B). A higher expression of both receptors, which is an indicative of effective targeting, was obtained when cells were stimulated with both lactose and di-mannose functionalized nanoparticles. However, di-mannose-functionalized particles showed a higher level of expression indicating a specificity of this ligand for the receptors that were studied.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\nNanoparticle type,Average Particle Diameter (nm),Average Particle ζ-Potential (mV)\nNon-functionalized,162 ± 43,-20 ± 0.6\nLactose,235 ± 34,26 ± 2.4\nDi-mannose,243 ± 32,30 ± 4.2\nTable 1. Nanoparticle characterization. Non-functionalized and functionalized were characterized by quasi-elastic light scattering and zeta potential measurements. Particle size data represent the mean value ± standard deviation (SD) of dynamic light scattering data collected in three independent experiments. Zeta potential data represent the mean value ± SD of three independent readings. Change in the sign of the zeta potential demonstrates that sugar was efficiently conjugated to the 50:50 CPTEG:CPH nanoparticle surface.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3967/3967fig1.jpg",
