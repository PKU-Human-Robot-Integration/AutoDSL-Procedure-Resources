    "Cell-free CRISPR/Cas9 cutting assayDesign sgRNAsIdentify essential genes (e.g., UL29, UL30, UL54, a4 for HSV-1) or DNA regions within the viral genome.Design appropriate sgRNA target sequences within ~1 kbp downstream of the start codon. The requirement for SaCas9 cleavage is the presence of a PAM sequence (5’-NNGRRT-3’) immediately downstream of the ~21 base pair target. Select multiple independent CRISPR sgRNAs for each viral gene target for efficiency testing. Assess off-target activity of sgRNAs: The sgRNA sequences should be unique to the viral genome to prevent off-target cleavage of human DNA. Useful web sites for sgRNA identification and ranking of off-target activity are http://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/[href=http://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/] [CHOP CHOPv2 (Labun et al., 2016) and crispr.mit.edu (Zhang lab, MIT) (Hsu et al., 2013)].In vitro sgRNA synthesisGenerate templates for T7 In vitro transcription of sgRNAsDesign and order oligos for sgRNA synthesis: For each sgRNA design a 60 nt forward oligo (target specific oligo), containing the T7 promoter (5’-TAATACGACTCACTATA) followed by 21 nt of the specific SaCas9 sgRNA DNA binding sequence with the first 2 nucleotides replaced by GG (GGNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN) for T7 initiation and a constant 23 nt tail of sgRNA scaffold sequence for annealing (GTTTTAGTACTCTGGAAACAGAA-3’). These forward oligos are used in combination with a constant 82 nt reverse oligo (5’- AAAAAATCTCGCCAACAAGTTGACGAGATAAAC ACGGCATTTTGCCTTGTTTTAGTAGATTCTGTTTCCAGAGTACTAAAAC-3’) encoding the reverse-complement of the tracrRNA tail to add the sgRNA invariable 3’ end (SaCas9 scaffold oligo, Figure 1).Anneal sgRNA primers with the tail primer: For each sgRNA assemble the following reaction in PCR tubes:Reagent                                                             [μl]Oligo 1 (variable sgRNA oligo), 100 μM           1Oligo 2 (constant tail oligo), 100 μM                 1H2O                                                                        8Total                                                                       10Anneal protocol:Hold at 95 °C for 5 min.Ramp from 95 °C -> 85 °C at 2 °C/sRamp from 85 °C -> 25 °C at 0.1 °C/sHold at 4 °C.",

T7 in vitro transcription of sgRNAs. The 60 nt target-specific oligo contains the T7 promoter sequence followed by 21 nt of the specific S. aureus Cas9 sgRNA DNA binding sequence with the first 2 nucleotides replaced by GG and a 23 nucleotide overlap sequence of the SaCas9 scaffold. The overlap sequence is complementary to the first 23 nt of the (constant) SaCas9 scaffold oligo. The two oligos are annealed and both oligos extended from their 3′ ends by DNA polymerase resulting in a double-stranded DNA template for T7 transcription. RNA polymerase recognizes the double-stranded DNA of the T7 promoter and initiates transcription at the ‘GG’. The resulting sgRNA contains the target-specific CRISPR sequence as well as the RNA scaffold. Purify the dsDNA using the Promega Wizard Clean up kit and elute in 20 μl H2O. (Optional) Run dsDNA templates on an agarose gel to check the size.sgRNA in vitro transcription (IVT):For each sgRNA assemble the following reaction using the MAXIscriptTM T7 Transcription Kit and approximately 150 ng of dsDNA template and incubate overnight at 37 °C:Reagent                                             [μl]ATP solution                                         2CTP solution                                         2GTP solution                                         2UTP solution                                         210X Reaction Buffer                             2Template DNA (150 ng)                       ~4T7 Enzyme Mix                                       2H2O                                                          4Total                                                         20Note: Assemble transcription reaction at room temp (The spermidine in the 10x Reaction Buffer can coprecipitate the template DNA if the reaction is assembled on ice).",
    "Add the 10x Reaction Buffer after the water and the ribonucleotides are already in the tube. Remove template DNA: Add 56 μl H2O and 4μl DNAse turbo to each IVT reaction and incubate at 37 °C for 15 min.sgRNA purification: Purify the sgRNAs using the Omega EZNA PF kit and measure the concentration of the purified sgRNAs using a NanoDrop 2000. Elute in H2O or assay buffer). After purification, dilute the sgRNAs to 200 ng/µl each and store at -80 °C.(Optional) Confirm the expected size (~97bp) of the sgRNA on an RNA gel.Generate dsDNA substrate for the In vitro cutting assayFor each sgRNA amplify a 500-2,000 bp segment around the sgRNA sequence to be tested from HSV-1 genomic DNA using PCR. If the amplification is difficult, dsDNA for the cleavage assay can also be obtained as g-blocks (IDT).Purify the PCR product using the Promega Wizard Clean up kit.In vitro cutting assay with CRISPR sgRNA and SaCas9 proteinReagent setup:Dilute Cas9 protein in assay buffer to 500 nM. Dilute purified PCR product to 50-100 ng/μl in H2O.Confirm each sgRNA is at 200 ng/μl or higher.Assembly of cleavage assay: Each guide requires four wells of a PCR strip. Cleavage assays are performed in a reaction volume of 10 μl with final SaCas9 concentrations of 300 nM, 100 nM, 33 nM, and 0 nM, 400ng sgRNA, 200 ng dsDNA substrate in 1x SaCas9 nuclease reaction buffer.Add 6 μl of assay buffer to wells 2-4 of a PCR strip and 6 μl of 500 nM SaCas9 protein to well 1. Then add 2 μl of 500 nM SaCas9 protein to well 2, mix, transfer 2 μl of this to well 3, mix and remove and discard 2 μl of this mix.",
    "Since the final volume of the reaction is 10 μl, the final Cas9 concentrations are 300 nM, 100 nM, 33 nM, and 0 nM.Add 2 μl of sgRNA to each of the 4 wells. Incubate for 10 min at 37 °C to allow SaCas9-sgRNA complexes to form.Add 2 μl purified PCR product to each of the 4 wells.Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C.Add 4 μl of reaction stop buffer to each well and incubate at 80 °C for 10 min.Run all 10 μl of all reactions on a 2% agarose gel and image.  Analysis: Because the assay provides sgRNA in excess, SaCas9 protein is the limiting factor. Cutting efficiency is constrained by the total amount of template provided, but in general, sgRNAs that work well show robust cutting (larger band at 0-50% intensity of no SaCas9 control) and there will be evidence of graded activity at lower SaCas9 concentrations. Figure 2 shows the results of the in vitro cleavage assay for three sgRNA targeting the essential HSV UL30 gene (encoding the viral polymerase). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200904/20200904001914_8400.jpgFigure 2.

Following this, each of the products is run on an agarose gel to determine the relative amount of each amplicon. Based on the brightness of the amplicon band on the gel, the PCR products of a particular loci are pooled such that each amplicon is ~equally represented in the final pool. The pooled product is then run on an agarose gel and gel-purified before being submitted for sequencing. With a set of 24 unique barcoding primer pairs a total of 24 sgRNAs can be analyzed in parallel with one deep sequencing sample.Adapter (first round) PCR with target gene-specific primersDesign a primer set generating a ~200 bp product around the CRISPR site and add the adapter sequences to forward and reverse primer (see Figure 3). The CRISPR site should be in the center 1/3 of the amplicon to obtain good sequencing across the targeted site. The adapter sequences are used in the second round (barcoding) PCR for primer annealing.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200904/20200904002421_1555.jpgFigure 3. Deep sequencing (MiSeq) process. A diagram of the two step PCR (adapter PCR, barcode PCR). The first step (adapter PCR) uses gene specific primers (black) with extensions (orange) for the second step (barcode PCR).",
    "The following sequences are the adaptors that should be added to the gene-specific primers: Adapter sequence for forward primer: 5’-TCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT-target specific sequence-3’, Adapter sequence for reverse primer: 5’-TGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCT-target specific sequence-3’. The barcode PCR primers anneal to the adapter sequences and contain a barcode (blue) as well as P5/P7 sequences for binding to the flow cell. The three sequencing reads cover the amplicon/target sequence and read the barcode.Perform a Phusion touch-down PCR, which increases the specificity of the reaction, according to the following protocol. Use the NEB calculator to determine the annealing temperature (http://tmcalculator.neb.com/#!/[href=http://tmcalculator.neb.com/#!/]).Reagent                                                            [μl]5x GC buffer                                                       2dNTPs (10 mM)                                                  0.2Forward primer (25 μM)                                    0.05Reverse primer (25 μM)                                     0.05Template (~1-10 ng gDNA from B4b-iii)           1Phusion polymerase                                            0.1DMSO                                                                     0.3H2O                                                                         6.3Total                                                                        10Cycle protocol:Initial denaturation 98 °C 30 s 15xDenaturation 98 °C 10 sAnnealing 72 °C (-0.5 °C/cycle) 30 sElongation 72 °C 2 min15x Denaturation 98 °C 10 sAnnealing Tm 30 sElongation 72 °C 2 minFinal elongation 72 °C 5 minHold at 4 °CRun a small amount (2 μl) on a 1.5% agarose gel to ensure that the PCR worked. If so, move on to the second round (barcoding) PCR.Barcode (second round) PCR with barcoding primers: This PCR uses universal primers (not gene-specific, see Table 1) to attach the sequencing adaptors and barcode to the amplicon. The forward primer is the same, but there are 24 reverse primers containing different barcodes (for testing of up to 24 different sgRNAs in parallel).Set up a standard 10 μl PCR mix using 1 μl of the first round PCR product as the template as follows:PCR Rx                                          [μl]5x GC buffer                                   2dNTPs (10 mM)                              0.2Forward primer (10 μM)                0.5Reverse primer (5 μM)                    1Adapter PCR (template)                 1.0Phusion                                             0.1DMSO                                                0.3H2O                                                     4.",

This allows you to ensure that the PCR worked and to normalize the amount of each amplicon when PCR products are pooled together for MiSeq. Of note, in some cases, one may see a large primer dimer amplicon around 175 bp in addition to the correct band.Pool amplicons and perform gel extraction:1)Pool (up to 24) amplicons for different sgRNAs–do not pool across amplicons from different targeted viral genes as this will make the gel extraction more difficult. From the previous gel, estimate equal molarities when pooling (i.e., compensate for weaker looking amplicons by adding more to the pool). This will even out the read counts across different amplicons during MiSeq.2)Run pooled amplicons on a 1.5% agarose gel and gel extract the DNA using the Promega Gel Extraction Kit.Submit purified/pooled amplicons for IlluminaMiSeq using the 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation kit (Illumina).

Use Cas-OFFinder (http://www.rgenome.net/cas-offinder/[href=http://www.rgenome.net/cas-offinder/]) in offline mode to look for all predicted off-target sites with 6 or fewer mismatches within hg38 for each sgRNA and determine the overlap between predicted variants and off-target sites.To detect off-target effects in the viral (HSV) genome: Align the unmapped reads to the HSV-1 KOS genomic sequence (GenBank: KT899744) and call variants using mutect2's tumor-normal calling.

    "Harvest cells at 24 hpi and follow the protocol for titration of viral yield in Step C2c above using FO6 and V27 cells.To count the number of green plaques, fix the cells with 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min.To calculate reactivated d109, count green plaques and subtract the number of GFP-positive plaques on V27 cells from the number of GFP-positive plaques on FO6 cells.Reactivation analysis: For the reactivation assay, it is important to include a control for recombination between WT HSV-1 and d109 which could transfer the GFP sequence to WT HSV-1 and result in production of false GFP-positive plaques. We quantify d109 viral reactivation using plaque assays by counting GFP-positive plaques on complementing FO6 cells. FO6 is a Vero-derived cell line expressing ICP4, ICP27, and ICP0 upon HSV-1 infection, thereby complementing replication of d109 virus (Samaniego et al., 1998). To measure these recombinant viruses, we count GFP-positive plaques formed on V27 cells, which express ICP27 (but not ICP4 and ICP0) upon infection with HSV. Because ICP27 is replaced with GFP in HSV-1 d109, any recombinant GFP-positive but ICP27-negative HSV mutants that arise (but not HSV-1 d109), can replicate in V27 cells. To calculate the number of plaques originating from reactivated d109 genomes, we subtract the number of GFP-positive plaques on V27 cells from the number of GFP-positive plaques on FO6 cells (see Figures 6B and 6C)."
