    "Both the Matrix and the Search pages provide an intuitive method to perform metadata-based searches for ENCODE datasets in the form of facet filters, which are categorized lists of commonly used experimental metadata.\nNecessary Resources\nHardware\nComputer with internet access\nSoftware\nUp-to-date web browser (Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, Safari)\nUse the matrix to navigate to a search page\n1. Navigate to the ENCODE portal home page at https://www.encodeproject.org[href=https://www.encodeproject.org]. A clickable widget labeled “Help” automatically loads in the lower right corner of the browser window, which contains links to interactive tutorials, frequently asked questions, and other documentation on topics not addressed in this article. Users are encouraged to explore the widget for additional help with the portal.\n2. In the toolbar along the top of the page, click “Data.” This opens a drop-down menu with multiple options (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.89#cpbi89-fig-0001]).\nThe menu options in the toolbar provide access to key resources on the portal, including the Experiment matrix page and a link back to the home page. For example, the Data drop-down menu also has links to Search and Summary pages, which represent the same data as the Experiment matrix page but in different layouts. The Encyclopedia menu contains information about and links to integrative-level annotations generated using ENCODE data. The Materials & Methods menu links to information about experimental components used, data-processing methods, and portal-organization methodology. The Help menu contains links to information about ENCODE, portal usage, past ENCODE workshops, and contact information. A cart menu will also appear here if there are experiments added to the cart, which is discussed in Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.89#cpbi89-prot-0003].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d791bbf7-c167-49b1-9def-66805e5a2d85/cpbi89-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nThe ENCODE home page. This image shows the Data drop-down menu in the toolbar opened. The first item in the menu is a link to the Experiment Matrix page.",
    "3. In the drop-down menu, click “Experiment Matrix” to navigate to the Experiment matrix page (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.89#cpbi89-fig-0002]).\n         \nThe Experiment matrix page lists biosample types, which refer to the biological material used such as a cell culture or tissue sample along the y axis, and various assays along the x axis, with each cell indicating the number of experiments of that combination of assay and biosample type.\nOnly a subsection of the matrix is visible upon loading the page. To view more, click the arrows along the left side of the biosample category headers to expand the categories and reveal an extended list of available biosample types. With the mouse cursor hovering on top of the matrix, scroll horizontally to view more available assays.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5b0a9607-d06d-459b-b8a1-53b718a68216/cpbi89-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nThe Experiment Matrix page displays available ENCODE data in a matrix with biosample types and assays as the axes. Each cell of the matrix is clickable and leads to a list of experiments matching the given combination of biosample type and assay.\n4. Click on the cell for transcription factor ChIP-seq (abbreviated as TF ChIP-seq) experiments on K562. As of September 2019, the ENCODE portal had 530 experiments in this group. This link leads to a search page with a list of the 530 experiments, shown in Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.89#cpbi89-fig-0003].\nBy default, only experiments with the status “released” are included in a search. Explanations of the meaning of different experimental statuses are available in Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.89#cpbi89-tbl-0001].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/314bd88e-5026-42bd-baaa-9f97b8583b19/cpbi89-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3",
    "The Experiment search page displays ENCODE data as a list of search results. Each experiment is shown with a brief summary of the biological material and assay name, and a link to its individual experiment summary page with more metadata details (see Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.89#cpbi89-fig-0005]). On the left is the facet sidebar, which can be used to modify and refine the search results. The “Add all items to cart” button is a Cart function, explained further in Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.89#cpbi89-prot-0004].\nTable 1.\n                Dataset Statusesa[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.89#cpbi89-tbl1-note-0001_27]\ntable:\n﻿Status,Meaning\nReleased,\"Publicly available datasets are marked with the “released” status. Datasets become publicly available after automatic and manual review to make sure they meet the standards and do not have data or metadata issues and inconsistencies. This status is selected by default when visiting all search views, including the Matrix page (refer to Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.89#cpbi89-prot-0001], step 2).\"\nRevoked,\"An error was found with the experiment after it became publicly available, so the status was changed to “revoked” to indicate that caution should be exercised before using the data. Some examples of errors are:  1.The data was not compliant with the ENCODE quality requirements 2.Issue discovered with experimental elements (antibody, biosample, etc.)\"\nArchived,\"The dataset was superseded by another dataset that has higher quality, was collected and/or processed with newer technology, etc. The ENCODE DCC encourages use of the superseding experiment instead of the archived one.\"\na Additional information is available at https://www.encodeproject.org/help/getting-started/status-terms/[href=https://www.encodeproject.org/help/getting-started/status-terms/].\nFilter search results using facets\n5. The sidebar on the left side of the search page is populated with facets, which allow users to filter search results by different properties. Locate the “Assay title” facet and observe that the facet term “TF ChIP-seq” is highlighted in blue, indicating that the search results have been filtered for experiments with an assay title of TF ChIP-seq.",
    "Clicking a cell in the “TF ChIP-seq” column on the Experiment matrix page (see step 4) automatically selects the “TF ChIP-seq” facet term.\nIn general, selecting a facet term applies that term as a filter, and automatically updates the displayed search results.\n6. Scroll further down on the page and locate the “Biosample term name” facet. Observe that “K562” is already selected, indicating that the search results have been filtered for experiments with a biosample term name of K562.\n         \nClicking a cell in the “K562” row on the Experiment matrix page (see step 4) automatically selects the “K562” facet term.\nSelections can be made in more than one facet at a time. When such a selection is made, the combined filters possess an AND relationship. For example, the selection of TF ChIP-seq in the “Assay title” facet and K562 in the “Biosample term name” facet returns only experiments that are TF ChIP-seq assays AND use K562 cells as the biosample.\n7. In the type-ahead search box below the “Biosample term name” label, type DND-41. The list of terms below the search box will be dynamically filtered.\nBecause there are many biosample types to choose from, a type-ahead search is available for this facet to help speed up the search process. This also applies to other facets with many terms, such as “Target of assay.”\n8. Click “DND-41” in the “Biosample term name” facet.\n         \nMore than one facet term can be selected in a single facet simultaneously. Multiple selections in one facet represent an OR relationship between the selected facet terms. In this example, the selection of “K562” and “DND-41” terms means the returned experiments may be on K562 or DND-41 cells.\nThe URL for the current search is https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=Experiment&status=released&assay_title=TF+ChIP-seq&biosample_ontology.term_name=K562&biosample_ontology.term_name=DND-41[href=https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=Experiment&status=released&assay_title=TF+ChIP-seq&biosample_ontology.term_name=K562&biosample_ontology.term_name=DND-41].",
    "9. Click “DND-41” in the facet term list a second time to remove the filter for DND-41 biosamples.\n         \nUsers can also click the “DND-41” link at the top of the facet after the words “Selected filters” to remove the filter. Both methods have the same result.\nThe URL for the current search is https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=Experiment&status=released&assay_title=TF+ChIP-seq&biosample_ontology.term_name=K562[href=https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=Experiment&status=released&assay_title=TF+ChIP-seq&biosample_ontology.term_name=K562].\n10. Locate the “Target category” facet. Scroll through the list of terms and click on “cohesin.”\n         \nTargets have been categorized based on their Gene Ontology annotations in accordance with the methods described at https://www.encodeproject.org/target-categorization/[href=https://www.encodeproject.org/target-categorization/].\nThe URL for the current search is https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=Experiment&status=released&assay_title=TF+ChIP-seq&biosample_ontology.term_name=K562&target.investigated_as=cohesin[href=https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=Experiment&status=released&assay_title=TF+ChIP-seq&biosample_ontology.term_name=K562&target.investigated_as=cohesin].\n11. Locate the “Target of assay” facet. Hover the cursor over the “RAD21” facet term so that a red icon appears to the right. Click on the red icon to exclude experiments targeting RAD21.\n         \nThe “Target of assay” most commonly applies to assays that utilize immunoprecipitation in their protocol, such as ChIP-seq. In this context, the “target” refers to the DNA-binding molecule targeted by the antibody for precipitation. However, the target property is sometimes also used for knockdown experiments or assays on genetically modified biosamples, such as shRNA RNA-seq, in which case it refers to the gene target of the knockdown or modification.\nThe URL for the current search is https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=Experiment&status=released&assay_title=TF+ChIP-seq&biosample_ontology.term_name=K562&target.investigated_as=cohesin&target.label%21=RAD21[href=https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=Experiment&status=released&assay_title=TF+ChIP-seq&biosample_ontology.term_name=K562&target.investigated_as=cohesin&target.label%21=RAD21].\n12. Scroll to the top of the page. At the top of the facet sidebar below the words “Experiment search,” click “Clear filters” to remove all selected filters.\n13. Click the back button of the browser to undo the previous action. This will return to the previous query state for TF ChIP-seq on K562 targeting cohesin-related targets except for RAD21. The facet terms which should be selected at this stage are shown in Figure 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.89#cpbi89-fig-0004]. As of September 2019, this search returned three experiments.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6d306185-2233-4e62-aa5f-3a5777f72de5/cpbi89-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4",

Review the list of search results, which displays the summaries of the experiments satisfying the selected filters.\n         \nEach result is labeled with a short title based on the assay performed and biosample used. Because this example search has filtered for both a specific assay and a biosample type, all the results are titled with “TF ChIP-seq of K562.”\nBelow the short title there is a more descriptive biosample summary, followed by the target if applicable, the lab that performed the experiment, and the project the experiment belongs to, such as ENCODE or Roadmap.\nAdditional details about each experiment are located on the right side of each summary:\nObject type: In this case, all results are Experiment objects. However, there are many object types modeled in the ENCODE database, which represent different experimental components. The data model is briefly discussed in the Commentary section of this article.\nThe accession: Each experiment on the ENCODE portal is given a unique and persistent identifier known as an accession, which can be used for citing ENCODE datasets. An example of an accession is ENCSR670JDQ. Users can directly access the record page for any accessioned object by appending its accession to https://www.encodeproject.org/[href=https://www.encodeproject.org/].\nStatus of the object: Brief explanations of the different statuses are shown in Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.89#cpbi89-tbl-0001], and further information is available at https://www.encodeproject.org/help/getting-started/status-terms/[href=https://www.encodeproject.org/help/getting-started/status-terms/]. Other object types aside from Experiments also have statuses.",
    "Audit flags: The ENCODE DCC uses automated checks known as “audits” to flag objects in the database for potential data or metadata issues, some of which are outlined in Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.89#cpbi89-tbl-0002]. Once flagged, the DCC is able to work with production labs to address the issues and ensure that all data and metadata are up to quality standards. Audits are divided into different severity levels, represented as red, orange, or yellow icons, which serve as an indication to users of potential concerns to be aware of if they use the data in their own research. If flagged, the icon(s) will appear below the Status and can be clicked to show further details about the audits.\nCart button: This button allows users to add experiments to their cart.

One example is using BEDTools to find overlapping peaks in two of the files (see Current Protocols article: Quinlan, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.89#cpbi89-bib-0013]).",
    "The ENCODE portal supports visualization of analysis results such as signal or peak data from one or multiple experiments at once using Ensembl (Aken et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.89#cpbi89-bib-0001]) or UCSC browsers (Kent et al., 2002[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.89#cpbi89-bib-0010]). Visualization of supported HiC data is available through Juicebox browser (Durand et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.89#cpbi89-bib-0005]). The ENCODE portal has also recently introduced embedded visualization of tracks directly on individual experiment pages using Valis genome browser (https://valis.bio/[href=https://valis.bio/]).\nNecessary Resources\nHardware\nComputer with internet access\nSoftware\nUp-to-date web browser\nVisualize results from multiple experiments from a search page\n1. To visualize files from multiple experiments at once, first navigate to a search result page according to the Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.89#cpbi89-prot-0001], steps 1 to 14.\nDue to limitations of the genome browsers, there must be fewer than 100 results for the search in order to visualize them. If more than 100 results are returned, the “Visualize” button will be disabled and will instead read “Filter to 100 to visualize.”\n2. Click the “Visualize” button at the top of the page. A pop-up appears with different options grouped by the available reference genome assemblies.\n3. In the “GRCh38” category, click “UCSC” to visualize the data from the experiments using the UCSC Genome Browser. Close the new window when done visualizing the tracks.\nVisualize results from a single experiment\n4. To visualize results from a single experiment, navigate to an experiment summary page (Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.89#cpbi89-prot-0001], step 15). Then, scroll down to the Files section.\n5. Click on the “Genome browser” tab to visualize tracks using the embedded Valis genome browser.\nBy default, all visualizable tracks will be shown. If available for the given reference genome assembly, gene and/or genome tracks are also displayed.",
    "6. While hovering the mouse cursor over the tracks, click and drag or scroll to the left or right to move along the genome. Scroll up or down to change the zoom level of the tracks.\n7. The sidebar in the Files section contains filters to switch reference genome assemblies or select specific tracks. Below the “Output type” header, select “signal p-value” to view three signal tracks. This produces the view shown in Figure 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.89#cpbi89-fig-0007].\nClick the left-facing arrow near the top of the sidebar to expand or collapse it. Click “Clear all filters” to remove all selected filters.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e98d915e-2853-4ebd-b276-87e892f4e13f/cpbi89-fig-0007-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 7\nGenome browser tab in the Files section of an Experiment summary page. This tab contains the embedded Valis genome browser, which can be used to visualize signal and peaks tracks directly on the ENCODE portal. Filters to the left of the browser are used to select which tracks to visualize. Here, only the “signal p-value” tracks are selected for visualization. The small arrow above the words “Choose an assembly” can be used to collapse and expand the filter sidebar.\n8. A search box for genes, labeled “Search for a gene,” is located above the tracks. Enter RBFOX1 and select the option that comes up, then click “Submit.” The genome browser will automatically refresh and load the location of the requested gene.\nThe chromosome and coordinates are displayed below the search box. To directly edit the values, click the pencil icon to the right of the coordinates.",
    "9. The ENCODE portal also supports visualization of tracks using external browsers. Click on the File details tab of the Files section. In the upper right corner of the table are two drop-down menus, one for the assembly and the other for the genome browser, which can be UCSC, Ensembl, or Juicebox depending on the file formats of the available files.\n10. Click the “Visualize” button to the right of the two menus to open the external genome browser in a new window.",
    "The ENCODE portal is a user-friendly interface for querying the ENCODE database. Queries can also be sent directly to the database using the Representational State Transfer (REST) API, bypassing the portal's user interface. The REST API accepts URLs in a typical HTTP format and returns metadata records as JSON objects. Search methods described in the Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.89#cpbi89-prot-0001] also make use of the REST API, but are “wrapped” in the portal's user interface for users who prefer to interact visually.\nFacets (see Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.89#cpbi89-prot-0001], step 5) represent a subset of commonly used query parameters. However, any property of any object type can potentially be used as a query parameter. These properties and object types are listed comprehensively on the ENCODE portal at https://www.encodeproject.org/profiles/?[href=https://www.encodeproject.org/profiles/?].\nNecessary Resources\nHardware\nComputer with internet access\nSoftware\nUp-to-date web browser\nCommand line terminal\nCommand line utilities:\n               \ncurl: https://curl.haxx.se/[href=https://curl.haxx.se/]\nA text editor\n1. Open any text editor and write down the first part of a query, which begins with https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?[href=https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?].\nAt the end of this protocol, the completed query will be entered into a web browser or a terminal command.\n2. Add the parameter type=Biosample to the query. All parameters take the format property=value. This example uses the “type” property with a value of “Biosample.” All objects share the “type” property, which indicates what category the object belongs to. The full query is now: https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=Biosample[href=https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=Biosample].\n         \nThis query would return a list of all biosample objects on the portal.\nThe list of all object types is available on the Schemas page, which can be accessed by clicking the Materials & Methods drop-down menu in the top toolbar and then clicking Schemas.",
    "3. Add another parameter to the query by first appending “&” to the end of the query. Then, add the life_stage=adult parameter to the end. Add another parameter, biosample_ontology.organ_slims=eye, to filter by organ. All parameters will take the same format as the first one. The full query is now: https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=Biosample&life_stage=adult&biosample_ontology.organ_slims=eye[href=https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=Biosample&life_stage=adult&biosample_ontology.organ_slims=eye].\n         \nDifferent object types have different properties. From the Schemas page (see step 2), click on any of the objects to view a list of their properties.\nOther syntax tips and special parameters, as listed in Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.89#cpbi89-tbl-0003], exist which can also be utilized for querying.\nTable 3.\n                Syntax for Query Building\ntable:\n﻿Syntax,Parameter example,Description\n=,assay_title=TF ChIP-seq,The equal symbol (=) connects a property to its value\n&,assay_title=DNase-seq&assembly=mm10,The ampersand (&) symbol joins multiple parameters together\n!=,assembly!=hg19,\"!= represents “not equals” and acts as a negation. In the example shown, the parameter would filter for objects with reference genome assemblies which are not hg19. This is equivalent to clicking the red exclusion icon in step 11 of the Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.89#cpbi89-prot-0001].\"\n*,treatment=*,The wildcard (*) means the parameter can have any value\n.,biosample_ontology.term_name=HepG2,\"The data model of the ENCODE portal allows for certain objects to be embedded in others. Objects are able to access the properties of the objects embedded in them. The period joins properties and sub-properties to form the “path” to an embedded property, akin to how the forward slash (/) is used in file directory paths. In this example, the biosample_ontology object is embedded in experiment objects, and this parameter accesses the term_name property of biosample_ontology.\"\nformat,format=json,format is a special property. Appending this to the query returns the page as a raw JSON object. The default value is HTML.",
    "frame,frame=embedded,\"frame is a special property indicating how the ENCODE database should return a requested object. Some examples of values include:  Object: No objects are embedded Embedded: All objects are embedded Raw: Object links are in UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) format, rather than the default @id format\"\n4. Request the query by entering the following command, which uses curl to fetch a URL, into the command line terminal: curl -H “Accept: application/json” https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=Biosample&life_stage=adult&biosample_ontology.organ_slims=eye\nAfter entering the command, the record for the biosample search should print directly to the terminal window. Like all objects on the portal, this record is a JSON object. Examples of terminal outputs are available at https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/encodeproject/api/basic_search#/[href=https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/encodeproject/api/basic_search#/].\nOther command-line utilities can also be used here. Some programming languages also have suitable libraries for this purpose.\n5. Alternatively, enter the query URL into a web browser to display the output as a list resembling the search page shown in Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.89#cpbi89-prot-0001], step 4."
