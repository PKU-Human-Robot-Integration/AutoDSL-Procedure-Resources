  "procedures": [
    "All procedures involving animal subjects were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and Ethical Committee at Nova University Medical School, Lisbon, Portugal (08/2012/CEFCM).\n1. Median nerve surgery\nNOTE: Follow aseptic technique during the surgery. Use personal protective instruments (PPE) and wear a sterile surgical gown17. Autoclave all the required surgical instruments prior to the surgery (see the Table of Materials).\nUse 12-week-old Wistar rats. Provide them with ad libitum food and water with 12 h light-dark cycles 7 days prior to surgery. Prior to anesthesia, weigh the rat to determine the amount of anesthetic required.\nAnesthetize the rat with an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine (40–80 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (5–10 mg/kg of body weight). Check for the depth of anesthesia by the lack of response to a toe pinch and by observing of respiration rate throughout the entire procedure18,19. Provide additional analgesia if a respiratory rate over 110 cycles/min or motor response to toe pinching is observed18,20.\nInject 1 mg/kg of meloxicam subcutaneously to provide preemptive analgesia20,21.\nTo avoid corneal abrasion during the surgery, apply ophthalmic gel to both the eyes.\nUse a depilatory cream to remove the hair over the medial aspect on the right. Once done, wash with warm saline to remove the cream17.\nLay the rat in supine position on a heating pad. Apply an iodine or chlorhexidine-based surgical scrub over the operative site. Leave it for at least 15 s and then wipe with ethanol. Repeat the application 3x. Ensure that the scrub is in contact with the skin for at least 2 min prior to proceeding with the surgery.\n\tNOTE: Contact the infection control authority at your research unit for alternative protocols to prevent surgical site infection19.\nDrape the surgical area17.",
    "NOTE: Perform all procedures under strict aseptic conditions19.\nIncise the skin in the medial aspect of the right arm and pectoral region to the deep fascial plane, using a number 15 scalpel blade. Carefully cauterize any bleeding vessels using an electric cautery.\nCarefully divide the brachial fascia, which presents as a whitish sheath covering the muscles, using a thermocautery or a pair of blunt scissors, taking care not to damage the vascular and nerve structures in the medial aspect of the arm.\nOpen a pair of scissors bluntly beneath the terminal insertion of the pectoralis major muscle, in order to tease this muscle away from the underlying axillary artery and vein, as well as from the terminal branches of the brachial plexus.\nDivide the insertion of the pectoralis major muscle with an electric cautery. Expose and section the pectoralis minor muscle.\nBluntly dissect the MN from the brachial vessels and from the ulnar nerve starting from the axillary region up to the elbow. This allows exposure of the different terminal branches of the brachial plexus, namely the median, the ulnar, the radial, the axillary and the musculocutaneous nerves (Figure 2).\nSeparate different experimental groups as described below.\n\t\nCreate the Sham group by only dissecting the MN.\nCreate the Crush group by compressing the MN in the middle portion of the arm for 15 s using a number 5 microsurgery forceps, or a similar instrument22,23.\nCreate the Excision group using a pair of microsurgery scissors to excise a 10 mm-long segment from the central part of the MN in the arm. Ligate the proximal stump of the nerve with an 8/0 Nylon suture to prevent axonal growth.",
    "Create the Graft group using the 10 mm-long-segment of the MN described in the latter step and rotating it 180°. Suture the proximal and distal stumps of the sectioned MN to the nerve graft using interrupted 10/0 Nylon stitches.\nClose the skin wound using interrupted 5/0 Nylon stitches10,24.\nProvide postoperative analgesia with 7 mL of cherry-flavored acetaminophen mixed with 43 mL of tap water25 to obtain a concentration of 4.48 mg/mL in 50 mL plastic water bottles made available to the rats ad libitum for 3 days25.\n2. Housing and physiotherapy\nAllow rats to have contact with the physiotherapy apparatuses 2–4 weeks before surgery, in order to ensure an easier and faster adaptation to the exercise settings. Perform the exercises by following the procedures detailed below.\nOnce a day, place each rat inside an individual physiotherapy sphere, and subsequently place the sphere in a room with few obstacles. Let the rat ambulate and explore the room freely for half an hour.\nHouse the rats individually in solitary cages with incorporated running wheels to help them exercise.\nForm groups of 4–5 animals and house these groups in personalized cages. Personalize the cages by including ladders, ropes, running wheels, and other environmental enriching elements.\nReturn individual rats to personalized cages the day after surgery.\nResume physiotherapy exercises 3 days after surgery.\n3. Functional tests\nOne week before starting to perform the functional tests, familiarize the rats with the food treats to be used as positive reinforcement. Provide this reinforcement after the successful completion of each test, before and after surgery. After the initial training period of 3 weeks, resume all tests 1 week after surgery.\nConduct the tests in the evening, when the rats are naturally more active. Resume tests 1 week after surgery.",
    "Perform the Grasping Test by placing the rat on a grid and lift it by its tail, letting it grab the grid with its forepaws11,26. Assign a “Positive” score if the rat can grab the grid with both forepaws. Assign a “Negative” score if the rat cannot grab the grid with the injured paw.\n\tNOTE: A positive Grasping Test indicates that the motor component of the MN is functioning16,27.\nPerform a Pin Prick Test28,29.\n\t\nMake a plastic platform with a 4 mm x 4 mm square grid pattern. Provide support to this grid with a 21 cm long metallic frame.\nPlace the rat on the platform and cover the grid with a 15.5 cm x 15.5 cm x 11 cm transparent plastic box. Wait for few minutes until normal activities (e.g., exploratory and major grooming) subside.\nStart the test when the rat is stationary and standing on its four paws.\nWith the help of a mirror, insert an aesthesiometer (e.g., number 4 Von Frey hair with a bending force of 25 g) through the mesh and poke the palmar aspect of the forepaw in the skin territory of the MN (Figure 1). Repeat the assessment 5x on each forepaw alternatively, waiting a few seconds after each evaluation.\nCheck for the bending of the Von Frey filament30 for the correct evaluation. Score the withdrawal responses as follows: “0” for no withdrawal response, “1” if the rat slowly removes the paw from the filament, “2” if the rat quickly responds to the stimulus and removes the paw or licks the paw.\n\t\tNOTE: If ambulation and biting of the filament are observed repeat the stimulus, because these are considered ambiguous responses.\nTraining sessions",
    "NOTE: Train the rats daily for 3 weeks before performing the surgery in the evening in a low-light environment. The training sessions are recommended specially for the rope climbing, ladder rung, and walking tracks tests. These can be done in the order presented before, starting with the rope climbing test, ladder rung, and finally walking tracks test. Allow the same animal a few minutes of rest before a new test.\n\t\nDuring the first week, place the rat on the last third of the ladder/rope/corridor, close to the box’s entrance. Condition the animal to move towards the box opening by gently touching and/or pulling the tip of its tail. Provide the rat a food treat once it enters the box, allowing it some seconds of rest before repeating the test. Repeat it 5x each day for 5 days.\nDuring the second week, place the animal on the second third of the ladder/rope/corridor Repeat the steps in 3.5.1.\nDuring the third week, place the rat on the bottom of the ladder/rope/corridor, on the opposite side of box’s entrance. Repeat the steps in 3.5.1, but only reward the animal when it completes the test correctly.\nPerform the Ladder Rung Test.\n\tNOTE: This test is used for assessing forelimb strength, stepping, placing, and coordination31.\n\t\nPlace the rat at the bottom of the ladder (120 cm x 9 cm x 2 cm with 18 steps 1.5 cm-thick, spaced 4 cm apart) and gently touch the rat's tail. Ensure that the ladder is placed at an inclination of 10˚ and leads to a 13.20 cm x 11 cm opening on a dark wooden 31.5 cm x 35 cm x 35 cm box.\nStart the timer once the rat starts climbing the ladder and stop the timer once the rat’s snout crosses the box’s entrance.",
    "Record the time and repeat the test 3x, each separated at least by a 1 min interval.\nRope Climbing\n\tNOTE: This test is used for assessing grasping strength, which is dependent on MN recovery32.\n\t\nPut the rat at the bottom of the rope and persuade it to climb by gently touching its tail. Start the timer once the animal starts climbing and stop it the moment the rats’ snout crosses the platform’s entrance.\nFor each test, record the time taken to climb to the platform and the number of slips of the injured paw while the rat climbs up the rope. Consider the test valid if the animal does not hesitate during the task or does not stop climbing. Provide the rat with a snack after performing the task correctly.\nRecord the time and repeat the test 3x, each separated at least by a 1 minute interval.\nWalking Tracks\n\tNOTE: This test is used for the evaluation of forelimb motor recovery33,34.\n\t\nSet up an apparatus consisting of a confined walkway 16.5 cm in height x 8.7 cm in width x 43 cm in length. Ensure that this leads to a rectangular 8.8 cm x 8.2 cm opening in one of the walls of a black wooden 23 cm x 36 cm x 28 cm box. Include a vertical sliding door to close the box’s entrance rapidly. Include a removable top to be used for retrieving the rat33,34.",
    "Place a piece of graph paper on the corridor’s floor. Grab the rat by its tail and let it hold a painting brush soaked in methylene blue. Position the rat at the entrance of the corridor to make it walk inside the box. Remove the graph paper from the corridor’s floor and repeat the test until a good representative impression of both forepaws is obtained.\nFrom the obtained prints, select one with clear successive forepaw prints, photograph them in a tiff or jpeg format, and measure the following parameters using the open access software FIJI35.\n\t\tNOTE: First, calibrate each image using the markings in the graph paper (Analyze | Set scale) Second, convert each image to an 8-bit format (Image | Type | 8-bit). Subsequently, use the Rectangular Selection Tool to select the paw print. Crop this portion of the image (Image | Crop). In each image, highlight the pawprints and remove the background by thresholding the image (Image | Adjust | Threshold).\n\t\t\nMeasure the stance factor by measuring the paw impression area. Use the Rectangular Selection Tool to select the paw print and press Control + M.\nMeasure the print length factor by measuring the longest length of the paw impression (for steps 3.8.3.2–3.8.3.6, use the Straight-Line Selection Tool for selecting the two most distant points and press Control + M).\nMeasure the finger spread factor by measuring the widest width of the paw impression.\nMeasure the intermediate finger spread factor by measuring the widest width between the second and third fingers.\nMeasure the stride length by measuring the distance between homologous points of successive paw impressions on a given side.\nMeasure the base of the support by measuring the perpendicular distance between the central portion of the paw impression and the direction of movement29,33,36.",
    "NOTE: Perform the last two measurements in two pairs of representative consecutive bilateral paw impressions33.\n4. Physiological measurements\nInfrared Thermography (IRT)37,38,39.\n\t\nEnsure that the temperature of the room where the measurements will be performed is between 18 °C–25 °C using a normal digital hydrothermometer with a thermal resolution of 0.1 °C. Ensure that no significant heat sources (e.g., computers or refrigerators) are present.\nAcclimate the rats by bringing them to the evaluation room 2 h prior to the evaluation. Before starting the experiment, anesthetize the rat as described above (steps 1.3–1.6) or following the institution's protocol. Check for the lack of the response to a toe pinch before starting the experiment.\nSwitch on the infrared thermographic camera 15 min prior to the acquisition and do not turn it off during the evaluations. Set the emissivity parameter of the camera to match that of the rat’s skin (ε = 0.98)37,40,41.\nPlace the rat on its dorsum on a clean and stable surface with a polyethylene sponge. Ensure that there are no reflective materials and other possible sources of artefacts. Fix its forepaws carefully in supination with double face glue tape. Insert a digital thermometer 2 cm inside the rectum to monitor the rat’s central temperature during all evaluations.\nHold the thermographic camera at a 90° angle and 30 cm distance from the rat. Focus the camera on the whole animal’s body. Obtain three infrared thermography images spaced 30 s apart.",
    "Transfer the acquired thermograms to a computer and analyze them using analysis software. Define the temperature of the plantar surface of both forepaws using a fixed rectangular region of interest (e.g., 9 x 11 pixels) in the plantar territory of the MN, for example in the center of the first metacarpal foot pad (Figure 1). Using the free FLIR Tools software, select the thermography by double clicking on it. On the left tools bar select the button “Add box measurement tool” and draw a rectangle of 9*11 pixels over the plantar area of both forepaws. While adjusting the rectangle its dimension in pixels can be confirmed. Perform it on both forepaws. On the right side of the image find the maximum, minimum, and average temperatures.\nOver the previously drawn ROI, right click and select export. The mean, maximum, and minimal temperatures, as well as a matrix of temperatures of the ROI are then exported to a .csv document. These data can later be explored using data analysis software.\nElectroneuromyographic (ENMG) Evaluation\n\t\nSet up an electrical stimulator. Tape a pair of disposable acupuncture needles (0.25 mm x 25 mm) with a negligible impedance [<1 Ω]) and 25 mm between them to create electrodes for stimulation. Now connect the stimulator and the electrode to a data acquisition unit to take the incoming signals and convert them into digital signals that can be processed with the computer software.\nPerform the evaluations in the same room, and always under the same controlled environmental conditions42,43,44. Pinch the forepaw to ensure that the rats are deeply anesthetized before starting data acquisition.\n\t\tNOTE: Deep anesthesia is of paramount importance to minimize variability associated with spontaneous voluntary and/or involuntary movements by the rats43.",
    "Expose the MN on both sides under the surgical microscope as described in steps 1.8–1.13. Use a number 15 scalpel blade to prolong the brachial incisions into the forearms with a ventral midline incision.\nExpose the superficial aspect of the flexor digitorum sublimis muscles by bluntly separating the overlying antebrachial fascia using iris scissors. Insert the ground needle in the quadriceps femoris muscle of the left hindlimb to connect the signal ground plug.\nStart with the right forepaw and place the recording electrodes into the flexor digitorum sublimis muscle belly of the forepaw and the stimulation electrode proximal to the lesion site in the MN. Moisten these electrodes with saline.\nEnsure that the software is set as follows: channel input port 1 (CH1) – stimulator to 0–10 V; and channel input port 2 (CH2) - EMG to 30–1,000 Hz. Start by choosing a stimulation amplitude of 10 mV and record the compound muscle action potentials CMAPs sample rate of 50 kHz for a duration of 40,000 ms. Gradually increase the stimulation amplitude in 10 mV steps until reaching 2,000 mV. Repeat the same for the left paw42,43,44.\n\t\tNOTE: The signal is amplified to 1,000x and filtered using a 30–1,000 Hz band. The stimulation output is set for a single pulse with a duration of 1 ms42,43,44.\nOpen the recorded file in the recording apparatus software.",
    "NOTE: By default, the screen will show tow windows on top in red, the stimulator pulses, and below in blue the recorder ENMGs. Sliding the horizontal scroll bar underneath the time scale allows visualization of the full record. The two main tools, Zoom tool and I-Beam tool, are on the bottom right side of the panel. Using the Zoom tool, it is possible to optimize the visualization of the CMAPs and explore the graphics. To guarantee a good fitting on the visualization screen, it may be necessary to adjust the display after zooming. To do so, select Display|Autoscale Waveforms. The I-beam tool allows the selection of specific areas of the graphs and performance of the desired measurements. On top of the graphs, there are three small windows where the measurements are displayed. P-P shows the average amplitude value of the selected area in volts (both in the stimulator record and in ENMGs), whereas Delta-T shows the time interval of that selection.\nMeasure the parameters from the compound muscle action potential (CMPAs, described in Table 1) using the homonymous measurement tools from the software plug in “Toolbox for unsupervised classification of MUAPs and action potentials in EMG”45.\nFor each rat, determine a minimal value of stimulation voltage after which the CMAPs amplitude does not increase further. Start from a 0.05 mV stimulus, and give successive increasing stimuli in incremental voltages of 0.05 mV.\nApply a stimulus 20% above this voltage in order to obtain a supramaximal stimulation value.\nAfter the latter value is determined and the corresponding stimulus applied, record the next CMAPs parameters.\nFlexion strength evaluation",
    "Use the same stimulator and stimulation electrodes to electrically stimulate the MN as in step 4.2. Set the input channel CH1 as the stimulator (0–10 V) and the output settings for stimuli duration of 30 s with pulses of 1 ms duration and 1 Hz frequency. Link a dynamometer, with a resolution of d = 0.001 N to a computer.\n\t\tNOTE: Real time visualization of data can be obtained by building a plot of force per time (N/s) using the software previously installed on the computer and linked to a dynamometer46.\nPlace the rat as described in step 4.1.4. Place a 5/0 silk suture loop through the second interosseous space of both forepaws. Attach the suture loop to the dynamometer’s hook and the forepaw aligned with the dynamometer without putting excessive strain on the suture line.\nFix the contralateral paw with tape to avoid spurious movement interferences in the dynamometer readings.\nSet the dynamometer to zero by clicking on the ZERO button.\nAdjust the stimulator to a supramaximal amplitude stimulation of 1.5 V by adjusting the voltage knot.\nOn the PC, open the software AFH-01. Open the separator “Device” and select the device FH5. Create a new file (“Measurements1” is the name given by default) and rename the file.\nPlace the electrode on the proximal part of the MN, click on play at the bottom of the program, record the pull on the dynamometer for 30 s.\nImport the values obtained to a data analysis software. Calculate the maximum and average force values and the area under the curve (AUC) for the strength x time graph for each evaluation.\nRepeat for the left forepaw.\nMuscle weight\n\t\nEuthanize the rats under general anesthesia by exsanguination47,48.",
    "Harvest the flexor carpi radialis muscle from both forearms, dissecting the muscle from its origin until its distal tendon insertion, using a number 15 scalpel blade.\nWeigh the muscles with a precision scale9,49."
