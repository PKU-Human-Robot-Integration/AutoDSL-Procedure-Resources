    "NOTE: Throughout the entire protocol, the micro-dosage system used for addition of water will be referred to as Pump0 while the micro-dosage system used for addition of precipitant will be called Pump1. The results of this experiment will be further discussed and referred to as THM2_micro-crystals.\n1. Parameters and Solution Setup\nFilter 16 mL of Na-Tartrate solution (1.2 M) and 16 mL of distilled water using a 0.2 µm sterile syringe filter.\n\tNOTE: The Na-tartrate solution represents the precipitant solution for the crystallization experiment. \nFill the precipitant and water bottles with 5 mL of the filtered solutions.\n\tNOTE: The bottles have a maximum capacity of 5 mL.\nMount the bottles in the pump holders of the experimental chamber.\nSet the experimental parameters in the software window to the following values: temperature at 20 °C, relative humidity at 20, and solvent as water.\n\tNOTE: Figure 2 shows the display window where the user can insert the correct values for each parameter such as temperature, relative humidity, and solvent. The software window shows also some additional parameters such as additives. This is only important for experiments where additives are present in the precipitant solution.\nOpen the front door of the experimental chamber and remove the coverslip carrier.\nPlace a clean and siliconized coverslip on the carrier and place it back in the device.\n\tNOTE: The coverslip has a size of 2.2 cm.\nClose the experimental chamber to secure the environmental conditions from step 1.4.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\n2. Micro-dosage Systems Adjustment\nSwitch ON Pump0 using the main pump characteristics in Figure 3 and create a water stream.",
    "NOTE: The water stream trajectory is created based on some pump characteristics that can be adjusted. Figure 3 shows the main pump characteristics and the optimal values that should be used for this experiment.\nAdjust the water stream aiming position towards the center of the coverslip by manually operating its designated adjustment screw. Switch OFF Pump0.\nSwitch ON Pump1 and create a liquid stream as previously done in step 2.1. Adjust the stream position of Pump1 towards the position fixed for Pump0. Switch OFF Pump1.\nReplace the used coverslip with a new and clean one for the crystallization experiment.\n\tNOTE: Soft wipes are usually recommended for cleaning the new coverslip from residual dust, prior to being used in the crystallization experiment.\n3. Setting a Thaumatin Drop in the Experimental Chamber\nCreate a new experimental file using the software package. Enter the following information in the experimental file: protein (thaumatin from Thaumatococcus daniellii), protein concentration (14 mg/mL), precipitant (Na-Tartrate), and precipitant concentration (1.2 M).\n\tNOTE: This information will serve for automated calculations of precipitant and protein concentration during the crystallization experiment.\nLoad the new experiment file to activate all information from step 3.1.\nMark the position of the protein droplet by adding a small water drop using Pump0.\n\tNOTE: The aim is to create a small water drop that will serve as a landmark on which the protein sample will be placed.\nPress the button Tare to set the weight given by the microbalance to zero.\n\tNOTE: This will remove the weight of the coverslip and the extra weight added by the small water landmark created in step 3.3.\nOpen the top lid of the experimental chamber and pipette 8 µL of thaumatin solution on the water landmark.\nRegister the new thaumatin drop by following the next commands.",
    "Press the button New drop to attribute the initial conditions from the experimental file.\nPress the button Const to compensate the natural evaporation of water from the droplet.\nCheck with the CCD camera if Pump0 is aiming in the protein drop. Readjust the position of Pump0 if the water stream is aiming outside the drop.\n\tNOTE: From this moment onwards, the protein droplet will remain at a constant weight, by automated water addition which compensates for natural water evaporation from the protein droplet. The weight of the protein droplet, as well as the other parameters such as temperature and relative humidity can be monitored in real-time using the display window. The experiment can be paused here.\n4. In Situ DLS Measurements\nSwitch ON the DLS laser and place the laser beam in the protein drop by manually using the adjustment screws.\nEnter the following DLS parameters: measurement duration (60 s), waiting time between two measurements (10 s), and number of measurements (300).\n\tNOTE: The first 30 measurements will serve as reference measurements for protein stability-check. The rest of the measurements will serve as a full investigation of the protein droplet during the total length of the crystallization process.\nPress the button Start to initiate the DLS measurements. Check the quality of the sample by selecting one of the DLS graphic representations.\n\tNOTE: The sample should show a high degree of mono-dispersity, without any aggregates in the solution. The DLS results can be shown and read as: radius distribution, radius histogram, radius plot, measurements summary, or as an overview of the count rate intensity.\n5. Sample Evaporation Step\nEnter the conditions for the evaporation step in the schedule table using the data shown in Table 1.",
    "NOTE: The sign \"-\" introduced in the column \"Molarity/Percentage\" in the second row represents a loss of water from the protein droplet, while the value \"25\" means that the droplet volume will suffer a reduction of 25%. This means that the protein concentration of the droplet will increase with 25%.\nActivate the sample evaporation step by pressing the button Autom. Press the button Stop when the sample evaporation step has finished.\nActivate the button Const to keep the drop constant after stopping the sample evaporation.\n6. Precipitant Addition Step\nEnter the conditions for the precipitant addition step in the schedule table shown in Figure 4 using the data provided in Table 2.\n\tNOTE: The first row of the table represents a calibration step, during which the software calculates the natural evaporation rate of the protein droplet based on the amount of precipitant that has to be added to the protein droplet. The software extrapolates this value and automatically adjusts the shooting frequency for Pump0 in order to automatically compensate the water evaporation for the next precipitant addition step.\nActivate the precipitant addition step by pressing the button Autom.\n\tNOTE: The addition of precipitant is an automated process, following the input from the schedule table.\n7. Tracking the Evolution of the Crystallization Droplet Over Time\nCheck the appearance of the thaumatin crystals by using the CCD camera.\nCheck the particle size distribution by using the DLS graphic representations.\nCheck the evolution of weight and experimental parameters by using the display window.\n\tNOTE: When the Na-tartrate solution reaches a concentration of 0.74 M in the protein drop, the droplet becomes rich in thaumatin micro-crystals as seen in Figure 7.\n8. Recovery of Crystallization Droplet\nCoat a clean standard Terasaki plate with paraffin oil.\n\t\nAdd 3 mL of paraffin oil to the plate.",
    "Disperse the paraffin oil on the plate wells by gently moving the plate at different angles so that the oil covers all the 72 wells of the plate.\nRemove the excess of paraffin oil by pouring out the oil that floats on the plate.\nPress the button Stop to finish the crystallization experiment. Carefully take out the sample carrier containing the crystallization droplet.\nWith the use of a pipette, place a volume of 2 µL aliquots of the crystallization drop in the wells of the Terasaki plate.\n\tNOTE: By recovering the crystallization droplet in a plate under oil, the sample can be periodically checked for stability and crystal growth with the use of a microscope or other DLS techniques that work with standard Terasaki plates."
