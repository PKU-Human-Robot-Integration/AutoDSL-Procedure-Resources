    "1. System Preparation\nClear the capture volume of any reflective material that may be observed by the cameras. This decreases the chances of actual skin-based markers being confused with stationary background markers during the movement testing and improves the overall accuracy of the session.\nCalibrate the cameras by aiming all cameras on stationary markers at fixed positions within the laboratory. Extend the static calibration to dynamic movements using moving markers placed at known distances. Be sure to cover as much of the capture volume as possible to optimize the calibration.\nOrganize all materials (reflective markers, measurement devices, etc.) to be used for patient preparation. This improves efficiency during testing and reduces patient burden.\n2. Patient Preparation\nExpose as much skin as possible over the joints and body segments intended to be measured. Minimize the amount of loose fitting clothing and ensure that any pieces of clothing that may interfere with the ability of the cameras to visualize the reflective markers are constrained. This can be done using tape or clips. Whenever possible, ensure that markers are affixed directly to the skin.\nPrepare the skin for marker fixation. Shaving or abrading the area may be necessary in instances where hair is present or when the skin surface is excessively sweaty or oily. Wiping the area clear using rubbing alcohol or a similar liquid can be useful. These steps are important to maximize adherence between the marker and the skin, and to prevent markers from falling off.\nPalpate for key anatomical landmarks based on the marker set to be used. Marking the skin at the actual landmark will improve accuracy for marker placement and provide information necessary in cases of markers falling off during assessment.",
    "Affix reflective markers over the anatomical landmarks according to the specifications of the marker set. Most marker sets will include a minimum of 12-15 markers placed bilaterally over the lower limbs and various anatomical landmarks of the upper body. It is important to note that the ability to re-create actual skeletal movement will depend on the positioning of skin-based markers. As such, careful consideration must be made when determining the biomechanical model to be used.\nTake measurements for important anthropometric data, if required. Depending on the biomechanical model, these data may be needed to calculate segment lengths, positions of joint centers of rotation, and overall inertial properties of the moving segments and limbs during offline processing of biomechanics data.\n3. Motion Analysis and Delivery of Real-time Feedback\nHave the subject stand in the middle of the capture volume for an initial static trial lasting approximately 3 sec. This trial is necessary to ensure that all relevant markers are visible and to calculate segment orientations.\nUsing the data collection software, label all markers as appropriate and create a template specific to the anthropometric characteristics of the individual. Matching marker placement to the individual body size will improve the real-time tracking and analysis of data. It is especially important to create a model of movement that can incorporate redundancies of marker positioning. In instances where marker occlusion or drop-off occurs, the ability to utilize additional marker positions where appropriate to produce the appropriate kinematic characteristic and maintain real-time display without breaks in the data.",
    "Perform an initial motion analysis trial lasting from 10-30 sec. This is required to obtain baseline data and can also be used as the first mechanism of providing feedback of results to the patient. Consultation with the patient regarding relevant findings is important to assist in the motor learning required when producing new movement patterns.\nHave the therapist explain the purpose of the intended movement modification. This should include both biomechanical and clinical rationales for the modification and how it is unique to the given pathology. Demonstration of the movement modification by the therapist will enhance motor learning by the patient. The movement modification will typically be determined based on the biomechanical and clinical presentation of the patient during treatment, or the research question to be examined if solely for research purposes.\nBegin the movement retraining session. If using a treadmill, allow the subject to choose their own preferred speed and provide a couple of minutes to reach a steady-state. This also allows the patient to become familiar and comfortable with the equipment, experimental set-up, and protocol.\nProvide feedback to the patient during performance of the movement. This can take the form of many different approaches, and combination of these is beneficial during early training. Start with less technical methods such as verbal feedback and progress to real-time biofeedback. Utilization of real-time biofeedback should always include clear display of a maximum of one outcome variable at a time.\nProvide sufficient time for the patient to practice the new movement. Effective motor learning is not achieved instantaneously. Instead, constant practice of the new movement characteristics will assist in ensuring re-formulation of the motor program responsible for that movement. A typical retraining intervention may require 8-10 focused training sessions, each lasting between 30 and 60 min.",
    "4. Patient De-briefing and Subsequent Training Sessions\nDiscuss the important findings and outcomes of the session with the patient. Important factors to focus on should include variability in performance, adherence to the prescribed movement modification and further description of the rationale and importance of the modification.\nObtain input regarding the session from the patient. Given that each patient's preferences will likely differ, it may be necessary to modify the delivery of the intervention for a given individual. These should be identified early to optimize effectiveness.\nDetermine the plan for subsequent training sessions, if necessary. If a multi-session intervention is chosen, subsequent training sessions should use a faded feedback approach to enhance motor learning. Provide less overall feedback and alternate between time blocks of feedback and no feedback in future sessions.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
