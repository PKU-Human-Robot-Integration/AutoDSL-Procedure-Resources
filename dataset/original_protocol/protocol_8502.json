Define the basic medium as serum medium.\nPipette 50 µL of stock solution of PD0325901 (1.0 mM) and Vc (100 mM), respectively, into 50 mL of the serum medium (final concentration: 1.0 µM PD0325901 and 100 µM Vc), and define the medium as Vc/PD0325901 medium.",
    "NOTE: Prepare the Vc/PD0325901 medium fresh before use due to the instability of Vc.\nUsing a pipette, transfer 50 µL of stock solution of PD0325901 (1.0 mM) and CHIR99021 (3.0 mM), respectively, into 50 mL of the serum medium (final concentration: PD0325901 1.0 µM and CHIR99021 3.0 µM), and define the medium as 2i medium.\nPrepare the gelatin-coated dishes.\nPrepare the 0.1% gelatin solution: dissolve 0.3 g of gelatin into 300 mL of ultrapure water in a glass reagent bottle with a cap and sterilize in an autoclave at 121 °C for 20 min.

Dry the dishes in air and use them within 12 h.\nPrepare 10 mL of mouse ES cell freezing medium in a 15 mL centrifuge tube: 90% FBS (9 mL) and 10% DMSO (1 mL). Use the medium within 1 day.\nPrepare a freezing container: add 100% isopropyl alcohol to the fill line of the freezing container, and discard the old isopropyl alcohol. Add new isopropyl alcohol directly after every fifth use.\nMake the enzymatic digestion buffer: weigh 1.2114 g of Tris powder into 100 mL of ultrapure water to prepare 100 mM Tris solution and add concentrated HCl solution (about 12 M) into the Tris solution to adjust the pH to 7.6 (about 0.6 mL of concentrated HCl solution).",
    "Prepare 50 mL of radio immunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA buffer): 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.5% NP40, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA. Supplement with 1 mM DTT, 1X protease inhibitor cocktail, and 1 mM PMSF prior to use. Once the PMSF is added, use the buffer within 30 min.\n2. Grow Mouse ES Cells on Gelatin-coated Dishes\nPre-warm mouse ES cells (wild type, 129 SvEv) culture medium, trypsin, and phosphate buffered solution (PBS) in a water bath at 37 °C.\nPassage the cells. Aspirate the medium completely from the dish and pipette 2 mL of PBS to the dishes to rinse the cells.\nRemove the PBS with a pipette and wash the cells again with 2 mL of PBS.\nRemove the PBS and add 0.3 mL of trypsin-EDTA (0.25%) to each dish.\nCover the whole dish with the trypsin quickly and then remove it immediately.\nPut the dish in an incubator at 37 °C for 1 min to detach the cells from the dish. Take out the dishes from the incubator and add 2 mL of pre-warmed serum medium to terminate the action of trypsin.\nDissociate the cell colonies into a single cell suspension by resuspending with a pipette (5 mL pipette tip) 10 times.\nTransfer 150 µL of 2 mL of the cell solution (about 190,000 cells by counting with a hemocytometer) into a new gelatin-coated dish, and supplement with 3 mL of freshly made Vc/PD0325901 medium per 6 cm culture dish. Culture the cells in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2.\nEvery 24 h while incubating, remove the old culture medium and add 3 mL of fresh Vc/PD0325901-medium into the culture dish due to the instability of Vc. Expect 70–80% confluency after 2–3 days.",
    "After reaching 70-80% confluency, passage the cells and continue to culture them as described in steps 2.2–2.4.\n3. Freeze and Thaw Mouse ES Cells\nFreeze mouse ES cells.\nDetach the cells from the dishes with trypsin by following step 2.2.\nTransfer the cells into a 15 mL plastic tube and centrifuge at 800 x g and room temperature for 3 min.\nDump the supernatant gently into a beaker and resuspend the cell pellet with 1 mL of freshly made freezing medium. Prepare the freezing medium 30 min prior to this step to ensure that it is room temperature before use.\nTransfer the cells in freezing medium to a 1.8 mL microcentrifuge tube with a 1 mL pipette and place the microcentrifuge tube into a freezing container. Add isopropyl alcohol to the fill line of the freezing container and keep it at room temperature before using.\nLeave the freezing containers overnight in a -80 °C freezer.\nTransfer the microcentrifuge tubes to a liquid nitrogen container for up to 2–3 years.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not keep cells in the freezing medium for a long time and quickly transfer the cells to a -80 °C freezer due to the toxicity of DMSO.\nThaw mouse ES cells.\nPre-warm 50 mL of serum medium in a 37 °C water bath.\nTake out a cell-containing vial from the liquid nitrogen container and immerse the capped vial in a 37 °C water bath. Shake it quickly in the water bath to thaw. Transfer the cells into a 15 mL tube with a 1 mL pipette. Add 2 mL of pre-warmed serum culture medium into the tube to dilute the freezing medium and then centrifuge at 800 x g and room temperature for 3 min.",
    "Remove the supernatant and gently resuspend the cell pellets with 3 mL of fresh Vc/PD0325901 medium using a 5 mL pipette.\nTransfer the cells from the 15 mL tube to a gelatin-coated dish and culture the cells for 24 h. Culture the cells again as described in Step 2.\n4. Extract Total Protein from Cells\nRinse the collected cells with 1 mL of PBS and then centrifuge at 800 x g and room temperature for 3 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet thoroughly with RIPA buffer supplemented with DTT, protease inhibitor cocktail, and PMSF by pipetting gently. The volume of RIPA buffer is about 5x that of the cell pellet.\n\tNOTE: Carry out the cell resuspension on ice.\nKeep the cells in RIPA buffer for 30 min on ice and centrifuge at 13,000 x g and 4 °C for 5 min.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new tube and store aliquots at -80 °C.\nDetermine the concentration of the protein with a Bradford protein assay kit.\n5.

Add 100 µL of ultrapure water into the centrifuge tube, and dissolve the DNA by pipetting approximately 15 times. Determine the concentration and evaluate the quality of DNA by the measurement of the absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm15. The DNA concentration is about 500 ng/µL.",
    "Digest 5 µg of DNA in a 50 µL solution system: add 5 µL of 100 mM Tris-HCl solution, pH 7.6 (final concentration: 10 mM), 2 U calf intestinal phosphatase, 1 U DNase I, 0.005 U snake venom phosphodiesterase I, and 5 µg of DNA (calculate the added volume according to the measured DNA concentration, ~10 µL) into a centrifuge tube and increase the volume of solution to 50 µL with ultrapure water. Incubate the mixture at 37 °C overnight. Centrifuge the digested DNA solution at 1,000 g and room temperature for 1 min to collect the solution to the bottom of tubes.\nTransfer the digested DNA solution from the centrifuge tubes into ultra-filtration tubes (a molecule weight cutoff: 3 kDa) and centrifuge at 13,000 g and 4 °C for 30 min to remove the digestion enzymes.\nPrepare the samples for 5mC and 5hmC analysis.\nFor 5hmC analysis: pipet 36 µL of filter solution to a new centrifuge tube (1 mL) and add 4 µL of 5'-(hydroxymethyl-d3)-2'-deoxycytidine ([D3]-5hmC) with the final concentration of 3 nM.\nFor 5mC analysis: add 196 µL of ultrapure water into a new centrifuge tube and pipet 4 µL of filter solution to the tube (50-fold dilution), due to the high density of 5mC in genomic DNA. Transfer 36 µL of the diluted solution to a new centrifuge tube and add 4 µL of (5'-(methyl-d3)-2'-deoxycytidine ([D3]-5mC) with the final concentration of 50 nM.
