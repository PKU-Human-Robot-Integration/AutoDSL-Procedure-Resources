    "A schematic summary is also provided underneath (Figure 2).Culture preparationUse 50 μl of each saturated T. thermophilus liquid growth culture to inoculate 10 ml TB medium containing the appropriate antibiotics (KmR [30 μg/ml] or HygR [100 μg/ml]) or inoculate the culture from the glycerol stock or from a frozen pellet.Incubate overnight the culture at 65 °C in a shaker incubator at 150 rpm.Note: If cultures have not grown optimally overnight, it is highly recommended to delay the assay.Mating mixTake 100 μl of each saturated overnight grown cells (OD600 ~1.5-2), place them on sterile microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged them separately for 4 min at 1,500 x g at room temperature (~24 °C).Note: In general, 1:1 cells ratio (both saturated cultures; OD600 ~1.5-2) is employed unless specific tests are accomplished or one of the mates has grown in lesser amount.Discard the supernatant and resuspend each pellet in 6 μl of warm TB medium (pre-heated at 60 °C) and supplement each of them with 0.6 units of DNase I (~0.8 μl; Roche Diagnostics) and its buffer (~1.5 μl of buffer 10x).Note: Room temperature TB medium can also be employed for resuspension.Mix both mates and gently vortex for 5 sec.Note: The purpose for vortexing is just to enhance the mixing. It should not be vigorous nor prolonged to avoid harnessing the cells.Lay the cell mix on a sterile nitrocellulose filter which had been placed on a non-selective pre-warmed TB agar plate.Note: A pre-warmed plate facilitates the attachment of the cells to the filter.Mating transferPlace the TB agar plate with the cell-containing nitrocellulose filter on a heater at 60 °C for 4 h.Note: The plate does not need to be incubated inside a humid chamber.Mating interruptionTake the agar plate out from the heater and pick the filter containing the mating strains with tweezers.",
    "Soak the filter in 1 ml of sterile TB medium in a microcentrifuge tube at room temperature.Note: Pre-heated medium (~60 °C) is recommended as it fastens the detachment of the cells from the filters.Vortex vigorously each tube to detach the cells from the filter.Note: It is preferable to perform several vortex times (e.g., 4 times, max 30-40 sec) than one prolonged one (larger than 1.5 min) to minimize the disturbance upon the cells.PlatingPrepare serial dilutions of the cell mix in TB medium in sterile microcentrifuge tubes.Plate 100 μl onto selective TB agar plates using glass beads or a spreader, one with both antibiotics (KmR and HygR) and also plate 100 μl of the mix on its appropriate dilution and selective marker (KmR or HygR).Note: Appropriate dilutions should be plated, for instance, 10-6 for each parental strain. Despite differences among mating efficiencies and thus, transconjugants arousal, in general, transconjugants should be plated 10-1 and 10-3 dilutions, which are common in standard matings.Incubate the TB agar plates at 60 °C for 48 h inside humid chambers.Note: Humidity preservation inside the humid chambers is essential for proper growth of colonies.Transfer frequencies’ calculationCount the CFUs on each selective plates.Express the frequency of transfer as the CFUs grown in both markers (KmR and HygR) divided by the CFUs of the recipient mate (for instance, HygR).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161109/20161109021321_7356.jpgFigure 2. Schematic representation of the Thermus transjugation procedure. Thermus derivatives PH1, a hygromycin resistant strain (in green, H-termed) harbouring the hyg cassette at the megaplasmid (P-termed) is mated to CK1, a kanamycin resistant strain (in blue, K-termed) harbouring the kat cassette in the chromosome (C-termed). Saturated cultures of each of these strains are mixed in equal proportion (100 μl each) and incubated together in the presence of DNase I and then diluted for plating in different selective plates.",
    "This transjugation protocol was optimized for Thermus thermophilus HB27, which shows the highest rates of cell-to-cell transfer. Less efficient strains should be incubated for longer periods or larger culture volumes employed in order to achieve reproducible data and maximize the transjugants yields.Qualitative assay of transjugation can be also assayed by laying 107 Thermus cells (for instance, 10 μl of saturated culture of CK1) on top of a pre-dried double selective agar plate (KmR and HygR) and topped with 107 cells of the counterpart strain (for instance, 10 μl of saturated culture of PH1). One unit of DNase I is added to the spot so as to prevent transformation (Figure 3). The plate is incubated in humid chambers, like aforementioned.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161109/20161109021522_2146.jpgFigure 3. Schematic representation of the qualitative assay of Thermus transjugation procedure. A double selective Thermus agar plate (KmR and HygR) is amended with a 10 μl drop of saturated cultures of Thermus derivatives PH1, a hygromycin resistant strain (in green, H-termed) harbouring the hyg cassette at the megaplasmid (P-termed) which is then topped with an equal volume of a saturated culture of CK1, a kanamycin resistant strain (in blue, K-termed) harbouring the kat cassette in the chromosome (C-termed). Both cultures are incubated together in the presence of DNase I and incubated at 60 °C in humid chambers."
