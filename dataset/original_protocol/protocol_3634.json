Freshly prepare all solutions and media on the day of the experiment. The required volumes for one mouse brain are described.\nIce-cold slicing solution with crushed ice: 500 mL/brain\nFreeze about one-third of the slicing solution in a freezer for 2 h.\nCrush the frozen slicing solution with an ice blender.\nMix the ice-cold slicing solution with the crushed frozen slicing solution and keep at 4°C until use.\nSlice culture media with lysolecithin/LPS: 1.5 mL/brain\nNote: ∼6 CC slices are obtained from one brain. Since each group to measure circadian oscillations is tested at least in quadruplicate, two mice are needed to prepare two groups, control and demyelinated CC.\nPrepare the following media to induce demyelination in CC slices.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_559_5.csv\nKeep at 37°C with 5% CO2 until use.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_559_6.csv\nKeep at 37°C with 5% CO2 until use.\nCold dissection media: 10 mL/brain; keep at 4°C until use.\nDay 1- inducing demyelination in acute corpus callosum slices: Dissect CC slices from acute whole-brain slices of wild-type mice\nTiming: 35 min\nThis part includes cardiac perfusion to deliver ice-cold slicing solution to the brain to minimize metabolic activities of the brain during the procedure, as well as cutting whole-brain slices and dissecting CC from them.\nSetup of Vibratome for slicing: Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] (Timing: 10 min)\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/559-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Setup of the Vibratome for slicing\n(A) Assembled Vibratome apparatus.\n(B) Blade in the blade holder.\n(C) Adjusted angle of the blade arm.\n(D) Setting of the thickness and the sectioning speed.",
    "Assemble the Vibratome apparatus by placing the buffer tray and blade holder (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nBreak a razor blade into two halves. Gently wipe one half of the blade with 70% alcohol or acetone to remove grease cover or other adhesives.\nPlace a blade to the blade holder (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nAdjust the angle of the blade arm until only the left and middle white lines are visible (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nSet the thickness to 300 μm with 1.25 mm amplitude and the sectioning speed to 0.2 mm/sec (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nTest the Vibratome setting by starting it without a sample. A gentle humming sound indicates the proper setting of the Vibratome.\nCritical: Be careful not to touch sharp sides of the blade at any moment for safety. Also, the sharpness of the blade is critical to reduce extra damages to brain slices.\nCardiac perfusion with ice-cold slicing solution: Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] (Timing: 15 min)\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/559-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Preparation of the brain for acute cutting with a vibratome\nCardiac perfusion (A) and the harvested brain in ice-cold slicing solution with crushed ice (B).\nCritical: The whole procedure from perfusion to harvest of the brain should take no longer than 15 mi to minimize neural cell damages.\nAnesthetize 8 to 12 week-old wild-type mouse with 50 mg pentobarbital per 1 kg body weight by intraperitoneal injection.\nNote: Confirm deep anesthesia of mouse by loss of toe pinch reflex.\nPlace the anesthetized mouse on a tray and stably fix its legs with tapes.\nSpray the mouse with 70% ethanol. Incise the skin from its abdomen to the ribcage using scissors to expose the liver and the chest cavity.\nIncise the diaphragm and the ribcage to fully expose the heart.\nTrim any tissue connected to the heart.\nCritical: Be careful not to damage any organs.",
    "Load 20 mL of ice-cold slicing solution in a 30 mL syringe with a 27 gauge ½\" needle.\nAlternatives: A 25 gauge ½\" needle can be used, but pay attention to flow speeds—too fast flow speed damages the circulatory system and organs resulting in unsuccessful perfusion.\nPierce the left ventricle of the mouse, followed by cutting the right atrium with fine scissors to expel blood from the heart (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nPress the syringe piston steadily to perfuse ice-cold slicing solution into the heart to circulate it through blood vessels.\nCritical: Keep the needle in the left ventricle during perfusion.\nNote: Successful perfusion is indicated by changed liver color from dark red to pale yellow.\nHarvest the brain from the skull and immerse in ice-cold slicing solution with crushed ice for ∼1 min to fully cool down (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nCritical: Gently harvest the brain from the skull. Any compressive force on the brain will damage neural cells.\nRemove the olfactory bulbs and cerebellum using a single-sided blade.\nCut acute whole-brain slices and dissect the CC: Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] (Timing: 10 min).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/559-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "Remove extra slicing solution from the brain surface with a sterile 3M paper and place the brain on the top of adhesive glue.\nNote: Orient its anterior-posterior axis perpendicular to the specimen holder (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nPlace the specimen holder in the buffer tray and fill the ice bath with ice (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nFill the buffer tray with ice-cold slicing solution with crushed ice.\nTurn on the oxygen valve for oxygenation of ice-cold slicing solution (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nRaise the platform of the Vibratome until the brain reaches the blade.\nSet the cutting window covering the whole specimen, from the start to the end point of the brain.\nStart the Vibratome to slice the brain. This takes ∼5 min.\nCollect desired brain slices and transfer to cold dissecting media: ∼ 6 brain slices contain the CC.\nTip: A sterilized disposable plastic spoid is convenient to transfer brain slices. Cut the tip of a spoid and aspirate an individual brain slice to transfer.\nDissect the CC from whole-brain slices under a dissecting microscope in a biosafety cabinet (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nTake a similar size of CC slices for the next step.\nNote: A similar size of CC slices should be used to prevent any variations between multiplicates in a group or between comparison groups (e.g., between vehicle- and lysolecithin/LPS-treated group). Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nDay 1- inducing demyelination in acute corpus callosum slices: Induce demyelination in CC slices\nTiming: ∼17 h\nTransfer dissected 4–5 CC slices into 1.5 mL of slice culture media with lysolecithin/LPS in a 35 mm dish to induce demyelination.\nTransfer another 4–5 CC slices into 1.5 mL of slice culture media with the vehicle in a 35 mm dish as a control.\nIncubate at 37˚C with 5% CO2 for 17 h.",
    "Note: Demyelination in CC slices treated with lysolecithin/LPS should be confirmed by immunostaining with antibodies against myelin markers, such as myelin basic protein (1:500, 808401, BioLegend) and CNPase (1:400, 836404, BioLegend) (Huang et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nDay 2- examination of demyelinated CC effects on SVZ circadian clocks: Dissect SVZ slices from acute whole-brain slices of Per2::Luc mice\nTiming: ∼4 h\nThis step includes the same procedure of Day 1, from step 1–6i, to obtain whole-brain slices from adult Per2::Luc mice. Minor modifications are: 1) SVZ areas in whole-brain slices are dissected from Per2::Luc mice instead of wild-type mice; 2) SVZ slices are co-cultured with demyelinated CC or control CC (from Day 1). During a co-culture period, bioluminescence signals are monitored in SVZ slices, representing the expression patterns of a core clock protein PER2.\nNote: Demyelination is induced in CC slices for 17 h on Day 1. To initiate co-culture of CC and SVZ slices on time, start Day 2 experiments ∼13 h after the beginning of step 9.\nNote: ∼ 6 slices from one brain contain the SVZ: 2 SVZ slices from one whole-brain slice. Since the size of SVZ slices is small, 4 SVZ slices are co-cultured with 1 CC slice. Thus, process three Per2::Luc mice together to obtain enough numbers of SVZ slices.\nAfter 13 h from the beginning of step 9, repeat step 1–6i of Day 1 (except step 2) with 8 to 12 week-old Per2::Luc mice.\nAdditional preparation steps on Day 2: prepare the followings before start of experiments.\nLumicycle media with dexamethasone and D-luciferin: 3 mL/brain\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_559_7.csv\nKeep at 37°C with 5% CO2 until use; protect from light.\nGlass coverslips with vacuum grease: this takes ∼ 30 min.\nApply a thick and even layer of high vacuum grease on the edge of glass coverslips.",
    "Dissect the SVZ from whole-brain slices under a dissecting microscope in a biosafety cabinet (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). Refer to (Guo et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nDay 2- examination of demyelinated CC effects on SVZ circadian clocks: Monitor circadian oscillations in SVZ slices\nTiming: 3 h to set bioluminescence assays and 5–6 days to record signals\nYoo et al. showed that isolated peripheral tissues from Per2::Luc mice emit bioluminescence signals for more than 20 days (Yoo et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). Although circadian oscillations in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN; the circadian pacemaker) of the brain have been monitored in previous studies, those in non-SCN brain areas are relatively less studied (Chang and Kim, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) because of difficulties in preparing brain slices from the adult mouse brain. Since neural cells in the adult brain are fully differentiated, acute slicing damages some differentiated neural cells. In this protocol, circadian oscillations are monitored in the SVZ but not in the CC. There is a structural difference between the CC and the SVZ. The CC consists of differentiated axons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia. However, structurally less differentiated adult neural stem cells and progenies reside in the SVZ. Thus, SVZ cells have higher viabilities in slices than other neural cell types. The SVZ cell structures benefit from monitoring real-time circadian oscillations for longer times in SVZ slices than in other brain areas. Although the SVZ is one of the best brain areas for this protocol, we tested this protocol in the hippocampus and the corpus callosum. We observed circadian oscillations for longer than 3 days in these brain slices (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). This supports that this protocol can be applied to other brain areas.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/559-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

(2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3].\nPlace 4 SVZ slices on a cell culture insert in 1 mL of Lumicycle media with dexamethasone and D-luciferin in a 35 mm dish (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\nNote: Dexamethasone synchronizes circadian clocks in SVZ slices, and D-luciferin is a substrate of LUCIFERASE.\nNote: Small tissues like SVZ slices should be placed on a cell culture insert to prevent signal noise from tissue movement (Yamazaki and Takahashi, 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nNote: A similar size and the same number of SVZ slices should be used to prevent any variations between multiplicates in a group or between comparison groups (between control CC and demyelinated CC co-cultured group). Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nIncubate at 37˚C with 5% CO2 for 2 h to synchronize circadian clocks in SVZ slices.\nAfter 2 h, take demyelinated CC and control CC from step 9 of Day 1 and wash with 1 mL of 1× PBS two times to remove lysolecithin/LPS.\nUsing a 1 mL pipette with a blunt tip, transfer one CC slice to the top of 4 SVZ slices in a 35 mm dish from step 14 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nNote: At least four 35 mm dishes are needed for one experimental condition.\nSeal each 35 mm dish with a glass coverslip with vacuum grease.\nPlace sealed-35 mm dishes in the LumiCycle machine (Actimetrics) placed in 37˚C with 5% CO2 incubator.",
    "Note: Although 35 mm dishes are sealed with glass coverslips with vacuum grease, supplying 5% CO2 during the monitoring is recommended for stable monitoring.\nUsing the program LumiCycle provided by Actimetrics to run the LumiCycle machine, start recording bioluminescence signals for 5–6 days. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7].\nAfter recording, open raw data with the software LumiCycle Analysis (Actimetrics), and analyze data from the second day of recording.\nNote: Bioluminescence signals are not stable on the first day of recording. Align signals on the second day and analyze.\nSubtract baseline from raw data and export to Excel for further analyses with other programs, such as CircaCompare (Parsons et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) and CircWave (Oster et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5])."
