    "This study was approved by the local ethical committee (Ethical Committee Human Movement Sciences) at the University Medical Center Groningen. All participants signed written informed consent.\n1. Study design and setup\nInstruct the participant and obtain informed consent in line with the Ethical Committee of the institution.\nDetermine the readiness for physical activity of the participants by performing a baseline assessment with the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire42,43.\nPerform in-patient screening with a medical doctor.\nDecide on a fixed power output for all participants (e.g., 10−20 W at 1.11 m/s), a relative power output (e.g., 0.25 W/kg bodyweight at 1.11 m/s), or a \"realistic\" individual power output based on a surface of interest (based on a coast-down test).\nAllow the participant to become familiar with the overground, treadmill, and ergometer conditions before testing.\nCheck the tire pressure and overall wheelchair mechanics before each measurement and inflate the tires to 600 kPa if needed.\n\tNOTE: To obtain valid steady-state outcomes for cardiopulmonary upper body work and gross mechanical efficiency (ME), one should adhere to a minimum duration of 3 min per submaximal (up to 70% peak exercise capacity) exercise block to achieve steady-state exercise with a respiratory exchange ratio below 144,45. Especially in handrim propulsion, the wheelchair speed must remain within a comfortable or feasible range (0.56−2.0 m/s) to exclude motor control issues46,47,48, which means that power increments are preferably controlled by increments in resistance.\n2. External power output during overground testing\nPerform the coast-down test on the surface of interest. Position the participant in an active position and as standardized as possible: feet on the footrest, hands on the lap, and looking straight ahead (the position should be reflective of the position during propulsion).\n\tNOTE: Every movement changes the center of mass, which changes the rolling resistance.",
    "Accelerate the wheelchair to a high velocity.\n\tNOTE: This can also be done by the participant.\nLet the wheelchair decelerate to a complete standstill without interference.\nRecord the time and velocity data during the deceleration (e.g., with measurement wheels or inertial measurement units). See sections 2.4.1 and 2.4.2.\n\t\nRecord data using measurement wheels.\n\t\t\nReplace the wheels of the wheelchair with a measurement wheel and the inertial dummy (Table of Materials), preferably while the participant is not in the wheelchair.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This example is for the OptiPush wheel. Other wheels might have different calibration requirements.\nTurn on the measurement wheel using the on/off switch.\nTurn on the laptop with the USB Bluetooth receiver and associated software.\nOpen the software on the computer.\nConnect the wheel with the software by selecting the correct communication port (COM). If the correct COM port does not appear in the list, press refresh to update the list and try again. Press Next.\nFill in the required fields on the Client Setup screen. Press Next.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Pay special attention to the Wheel Size and Wheel Side settings.\nGather offset data by pressing Start in the wheel setup and slowly spinning the wheel without touching the handrim until the red circle turns to green. Alternatively, press Skip to skip this step if the procedure has already been performed since the last wheel installation. Press Next.\nTo collect data press Record in the Data Collection screen. Resume the regular coast-down protocol from here on.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Scripts for the analysis of measurement wheel data are available in the Supplementary Material 1.\nRecord the data using inertial measurement units (IMUs).",
    "Attach the IMUs (Table of Materials) to the wheelchair: one on each wheel hub and one in the center underneath the seat. Write down which IMU is attached where and in what orientation for later reference.\nTurn on the IMUs and connect the IMUs to the computer using the NGIMU Synchronized Network Manager executable.\nTo collect data, go to Tools, then select Data Logger, and press Start. Resume the regular coast-down protocol from here on.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Scripts for the analysis of IMU data are available in the Supplementary Material 2.\nRepeat the coast-down procedure (2.1-2.4) and collect back-and-forth data to reduce the influence of uneven surfaces.\nOpen the coast_down_test software on a computer. Press Import data to import the coast-down data file (measurement wheel or IMU). Select coast-down sections in the data by using the slider in the graph on the right and pressing Grab selection.\nSet participant and wheelchair weight in the Settings section. Press Calculate outcomes. Write down the mean rolling friction (N) and rolling friction coefficient. Press Export to save all (meta)data for later reference.\n\tNOTE: When constant friction cannot be assumed due to air drag (i.e., in most sports environments) the analysis becomes a little more complex. The protocol is identical, but the initial speed should probably be higher. In this case, a non-linear differential equation needs to be solved and that equation needs to be fit with a curve fitter (e.g., Levenberg-Marquardt)49.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60492/60492eq1.jpg",
    "In this equation is the instantaneous velocity and is the initial velocity at the start of deceleration. reflects the velocity dependent friction and reflects the velocity independent friction (). Scripts for the analysis of coast-down tests are available in the Supplementary Material 3 and the graphical user interface (GUI) for the analysis of coast-down tests used in step 2.7 is available in the Supplementary Material 4.\n3. External power output during treadmill testing\nTreadmill characterization\n\t\nMeasure the belt velocity of the loaded treadmill with a calibrated tachometer to determine what treadmill setting needs to be used (e.g., for 1.11 m/s the treadmill needs to be set to 4.1 km/h on the display instead of 4.0 km/h).\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, determine the belt velocity by measuring the belt length and counting ten rotations while recording the time with a stopwatch/video camera.\nMeasure the treadmill angles using an angle sensor. Check for consistency by repeating the measurements and check for hysteresis by repeating the measurements in descending order.\n\t\tNOTE: Check treadmill velocity with a tachometer and angles with an angle sensor during every measurement if their reliability is low.\nDrag test: calibration\n\t\nTurn on the power supply of the drag test force sensor at least 30 min before calibration.\nSuspend the force transducer vertically and align with a self-levelling laser or angle sensor.\nSet up the drag test computer and connect the force sensor with the computer. Open the ADA3 software on the drag test computer and press Calibrate force sensor.\nAttach known (calibrated) weights (1-10 kg with 1 kg increments) to the sensor and register the digital values.\nFit a linear regression equation to determine the relation between applied load and measured voltage by continuing in the ADA3 software.\nRepeat (3.2.1-3.2.5) if the root-mean-square error (RMSE) exceeds 0.13 N37.",
    "Performing a drag test\n\t\nTurn on the power supply at least 30 min before measuring.\nSet up the drag test computer and connect the force sensor with the computer. Open the ADA3 software on the drag test computer and press Power table measurements.\nPlace the wheelchair-user combination on the treadmill. Position the participant in an active position and as standardized as possible: feet on the footrest, hands on the lap, and looking straight ahead (the position should be reflective of the position during propulsion). Instruct the participant to maintain the same position throughout the test.\nMeasure the offset of the load cell by recording force with no rope attached using the ADA3 software. Press OK.\nConnect the wheelchair to the force transducer with a lightweight rope. Ensure the load cell and rope are horizontally aligned with the rear wheel axle of the wheelchair.\nAccelerate the belt to the desired speed, in this case 1.11 m/s (4.1 km/h on display).\nIncrease the inclination of the treadmill, wait until the position of the treadmill and wheelchair-user combination is stable, and record the force and angle. Repeat for 10 increasingly steep angles (1.5-6% in 0.5% increments).\nFit a linear regression using the angle and force using the ADA3 software by clicking Next. Calculate the force at the zero-angle of the treadmill.\n\t\tNOTE: The intercept of the regression equation cannot be used if the treadmill angle has an offset.\nRepeat the drag test (3.3.3-3.3.8) if the RMSE of the linear regression line exceeds 0.5 N37.\nSetting power output on a treadmill\n\t\nCalculate the desired power output and determine the testing speed.\n\t\tNOTE: For the current protocol, this is equal to the results obtained in step 2.7.",
    "Calculate the required pulley weight by subtracting the drag test friction (from step 3.3.8) from the target friction (from step 2.7).\nPosition the pulley in front or behind the treadmill and make sure it is centered. Attach the pulley to the wheelchair and make sure the rope is level. Instruct the participant that the weight in the pulley might move the wheelchair.\nAttach the weight (usually between 0-1 kg) to the pulley system using a basket of known low mass and a carabiner. Slowly increase the weight if necessary, until the desired power output is achieved.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively change the power output by changing the angle of the treadmill based on the power table from a drag test.\n4. External power output during ergometer-based testing\nTurn on the ergometer at least 30 min before measuring. Start the associated software on the computer.\nPress the Participant widget, then press Add…. Give the participant an ID and enter the body weight of the participant. Press OK.\nPress the wheelchair icon on the Device menu. Fill in the wheelchair specifications in the form. Press OK.\n\tNOTE: The body weight variable is important, because it will influence the simulation provided by the ergometer.\nPress the protocol widget. Create a custom protocol by selecting Add…. Select Custom Protocol and press Next. Give the protocol an appropriate name and press Create.\nSelect Stages and click Add Stage and Resistance. Set the resistance to the friction coefficient obtained with the coast-down test in section 2. Set the target speed at 4 km/h and press OK (Figure 3).\nSet up the participant screen. Remove all widgets from the screen. Click Add widget and select the Wheelchair direction widget and drag it into the screen (Figure 4).",
    "Align the wheelchair on the rollers using the alignment system. Fasten the wheelchair using the four-belt system. Check that the wheels are not touching the ergometer and are properly aligned.\nPosition the participant in an active position and as standardized as possible: feet on the footrest, hands on the lap, and looking straight ahead (the position should be reflective of the position during propulsion). Instruct the participant to maintain the same position throughout the test.\nCalibrate the ergometer with the associated software by pressing the Crosshair button in the Device menu, and press Start calibration.\n\tNOTE: Scripts for the analysis of ergometer data are available in the Supplementary Material 5.\n5. Internal estimates of power output during hand rim wheelchair propulsion\nTurn on the spirometer for at least 45 min before any calibrations or testing.\nCalibrate the spirometer according to the factory guidelines using the associated software, including calibrations for turbine, reference gas, room air, and delay.\n\tNOTE: Room air and reference gas calibrations should be performed before each test.\n\t\nPerform a turbine calibration.\n\t\t\nPress Turbine in the calibration menu. Connect the turbine with an optoelectronic reader to the spirometer. Connect the calibration syringe with a known volume to the turbine.\nWhen the unit is ready, perform six controlled and complete strokes with the piston. Press the Exit icon.\nPerform a reference gas calibration.\n\t\t\nPress Reference gas in the calibration menu. Connect the pressure regulator to the calibration cylinder with a known concentration of mixed gas.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The cylinder must be open, but the pressure regulator must be closed.\nConnect the sampling line to the sampling connector of the spirometer and leave the other end disconnected. Let the spirometer flush the analyzers. Make sure that the sampling line is far from any exhaled gas.",
    "When prompted by the spirometer, connect the free end of the sampling line to the pressure regulator on the calibration cylinder and open the regulator. Exit with the Exit icon after the calibration ends.\nPerform a room air calibration.\n\t\t\nConnect the sampling line to the sampling connector on the spirometer and leave the other end free. Exit with the Exit icon after the calibration ends.\nPerform a delay calibration.\n\t\t\nConnect the turbine to the optoelectronic reader and connect the sampling tube. Ensure that both are connected to the spirometer.\nSynchronize breathing with the acoustic signal. This can be performed by the operator.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This procedure needs to be repeated every time a sampling tube is changed. Clean or switch the mask used for this procedure before giving it to the participant.\nExit with the Exit icon after the calibration ends.\nPut the spirometer mask on the participant. Adjust the elastic bands on the head cap to create a tight seal around the face of the subject.\n\tNOTE: Optionally connect a heart-rate monitor to the spirometer and let the participant wear the heart-rate belt.\nFixate the hose of the spirometer so it does not interfere with movement.\nPress Test, then enter a New subject on the display of the spirometer.\nFor submaximal exercise testing choose the breath-by-breath mode. To start recording press the Record key on the spirometer.\n\tNOTE: Scripts for the analysis of spirometer data are available in the Supplementary Material 6.\n6. Testing procedure\nInstruct the participant to perform 4 min of steady-state exercise at the desired speed (1.11 m/s).\n\t\nInstruct the participant to use velocity feedback to stay (on average) at the desired speed.",
    "NOTE: Speed can be shown from the measurement wheel or the IMUs from their respective laptops in the overground condition. The laptops have hook-and-loop straps that allow for fixation on the legs.\nInstruct the participant to stay (on average) in the center of the treadmill for the treadmill condition.\nInstruct the participant to look at the velocity and heading feedback on the ergometer screen in the ergometer condition and keep it (on average) within the target range.\nStart a stopwatch and the spirometer (step 5.6) at the same time.\n\tNOTE: This can be done without an external trigger as the timing difference from pressing start is negligible while using breath-by-breath spirometry.\nAfter 30 s, start the wheelchair propulsion.\n\tNOTE: For the treadmill and ergometer conditions this implies starting the treadmill or ergometer. When using a measurement wheel (step 2.4.1.8) or IMUs (step 2.4.2.3) start those as well.\n\t\nUse the lap button in the overground condition to mark the corners of the track.\nAfter another 4 min during the test, without prior notice, instruct the participant to stop pushing the wheelchair.\n\tNOTE: In the treadmill condition a few additional pushes are needed before the belt stops."
