    "1. Generating AML Cell Line Clones with High Expression of Stable and Active Cas9\nProduction of Cas9 lentivirus\nDay 0: Plate 4 x 106 293T cells in 10 mL of DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin and L-glutamine in a 10 cm tissue culture dish in a biosafety Level 2 (BSL2) certified cell culture hood. Place the dish in a 37 °C incubator.\nDay 1: The plated 293T cells should be 70–80% confluent on day 1. Perform the transfection using the following protocol in the afternoon.\nWarm the transfection medium, culture media and transfection reagent to room temperature. Thaw all the required plasmids for transfection.\nMix 9 µg of psPAX2, 0.9 µg of pMD2.G and 9 µg of pLenti-Cas9 plasmids with 500 µL of transfection medium in a 5 mL tube.\nAdd 1.7 mL of transfection medium to a 14 mL round bottom tube. Add 57 µL of transfection reagent directly into the transfection medium in the tube to avoid touching the wall of the tube.\nGently add the entire plasmid mix to transfection reagent solution and mix by gently tapping the tube on the side. Incubate the mixture at room temperature for 20–30 min. Meanwhile, change the medium from the seeded 293T plate.\nAdd the transfection mix dropwise to the plate and gently rock the plate sideways for efficient mixing. Place the plate in a 37 °C incubator.\nDay 2: Aspirate the supernatant from the transfection plate gently such that the cells are not disturbed or dislodged from the plate. Discard the supernatant. Add 10 mL of fresh 10% DMEM medium by sliding down gently from the sides of the plate to avoid dislodging the cells.",
    "Day 3: Collect the virus containing supernatant from the transfection plate slowly by drawing it into a 10 cm sterile syringe. After the supernatant is collected into the syringe, attach a sterile 0.45 µM filter to the syringe and hold the syringe and filter over a fresh, sterile 15 mL polypropylene conical tube. Gently plunge the syringe to filter the virus containing supernatant through the 0.45 µM filter into the 15 mL polypropylene conical tube.\nStore the viral conditioned medium in aliquots of 2 mL each in 2 mL cryovials at -80 °C.\nTransduction of AML cell lines\nDay -1: Dilute 1 mg/mL recombinant human fibronectin fragment stock to 10 µg/mL with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Coat a non-tissue culture treated 6 well plate with 2 mL of the 10 µg/mL recombinant human fibronectin fragment working solution in a BSL2 approved cell culture hood. Wrap the plate in cling wrap to avoid loss on evaporation and store at room temperature overnight.\nDay 0: Thaw the viral supernatant containing Cas9. Aspirate the recombinant human fibronectin fragment solution completely from the coated plate just before spinfection. Add 2 mL of viral conditioned medium with Cas9 to the plate and spin it at 1,300 x g for 90 min at 35 °C. This helps the viral particles attach to the spinfected well.\nMeanwhile, count the cells to be transduced and spin down 2 x 106 cells in a 15 mL polypropylene conical tube. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 2 mL of fresh culture media.\nAfter spinfection, remove all the viral supernatant from the spinfected well and discard. Retroviral particles from the supernatant are attached to the bottom of the spinfected well. To this well, add the 2 x 106 cells resuspended in 2 mL of medium from the step above.",
    "Spin the plate again at 1,300 x g very briefly (1–2 min) sufficient to allow the cells to settle down at the bottom. Place the plate back into the incubator and leave overnight for transduction with the spinfected viral particles attached to the well.\nDay 1: Depending on cell density, add more medium to the transduced cells to avoid overgrowth.\nDay 2: Since the pLenti-Cas9 plasmid has a Blasticidin resistance marker, add Blasticidin at a 10 µg/mL dose to transduced and untransduced (control) MOLM13 or mouse MLL-AF9 leukemia cells for the selection of Cas9 expressing cells.\nNOTE: Blasticidin selection of the Cas9-transduced MOLM13 or MLL-AF9 leukemia cells is considered complete when all the untransduced control cells have been eliminated. For cell lines other than MOLM13 and MLL-AF9 leukemia, a dose response curve must be performed prior to this experiment so that an optimal dose can be employed. Titration of the viral supernatant can also be performed in case of low-transduction rates.\nClone selection of high-Cas9 expressing cells.\nNOTE: We have noticed that in some AML cell lines, clone selection might not be necessary: the bulk Cas9-Blasticidin selected population already has high genome-editing efficiency. In this case, it is possible to skip Step 1.3 and move on to Step 1.4 to assess Cas9 expression in the bulk Cas9-blasticidin AML cells by western blotting. It would still be important to evaluate gene-editing efficiency in those bulk Cas9-AML cells (Step 1.5) before proceeding to the competition assays. We surmise that the selection of single high-Cas9 clones reduces the genome-editing variability, which is especially important when testing a number of different single guide RNAs (sgRNAs).",
    "Perform a single-cell sort of the Cas9-Blasticidin selected MOLM13 and MLL-AF9 leukemia cells henceforth called MOLM13-Cas9 and MLL-AF9-Cas9 cells, respectively, using a FACS sorter contained in a BSL2 approved hood. Sorting can be performed into 5–10 round bottom non-tissue culture treated 96 well plates.\nOnce single MOLM13-Cas9 and MLL-AF9-Cas9 clones have been picked and individually named, expand 10–20 clones with 10 µg/mL of Blasticidin in culture media to ensure the maintenance of Cas9 expression.\nExpression check of stable Cas9 protein by immunoblotting.\nMake nuclear extracts of all the Blasticidin selected clones of MOLM13 and MLL-AF9 leukemia using Nuclear Extraction Kit as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Check Cas9 protein expression using anti-Flag M2 antibody since the Cas9 in the pLenti-Cas9 plasmid is linked to an N-terminal Flag epitope.\nLoad 50 µg of total protein from each nuclear extract onto 10% Bis-Tris gel and run the gel at 120 V till upper bands are well separated.\nBlock the membrane with 5% milk solution in TBST buffer for 1 h.\nIncubate the membrane with 1:1,000 dilution of anti-Flag M2 antibody at a final concentration of 1 µg/mL at 4 °C overnight.\nNext day, wash the membrane with TBST buffer and incubate with HRP conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:5,000 (final concentration of 0.16 µg/mL) at room temperature for 1 h.\nWash the membrane thoroughly with TBST and develop the blot using ECL substrate.\nPick 3–4 clones with the highest protein expression of Cas9 as seen by Western blotting for further functional analysis (Figure 1).\nEnsuring high Cas9 activity in selected clones\nPrepare lentiviral supernatant from an sgRNA encoding vector with sgRNAs targeting the human or mouse AAVS1 safe-harbor locus as described in the Step 1.1.",
    "Transduce the top Cas9-expressing MOLM13 or MLL-AF9 leukemia clones with the anti-AAVS1 sgRNA lentiviral supernatant using the spinfection method described above. Select with 2.5 µg/mL Puromycin for 4 days.\nPurify genomic DNA from the MOLM13-Cas9 or MLL-AF9-Cas9 leukemia clones after Puromycin selection together with respective wild-type controls using the Genomic DNA extraction kit as per manufacturer’s instructions. Use 50 ng of DNA as a template to perform a PCR with the AAVS1_test_primers using 2x master mix of Taq Polymerase and the PCR program listed in Table 1.\nRun the PCR product on a 2% agarose gel and gel-purify the 268 base pair band using a gel extraction kit as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Sanger sequence the gel purified PCR product using the AAVS1_target-frag_F primer.\nAssess editing efficiency by the comparison of the AAVS1 edited and wildtype sequences using online web-based tools (Figure 2).\n2. Cloning and Transduction of sgRNAs in AML-Cas9 Cells\nMedium-throughput cloning of sgRNAs\nDesign 4–6 sgRNAs for the gene of interest using a web-based CRISPR design software. There are a number of CRISPR design tools available online such as http://crispr.mit.edu/ which generate sgRNA sequences based on an input DNA sequence.\n\t\t\nFill in an appropriate information in fields with asterisks. Click on the target genome for sgRNA design. Paste the target sequence in the Sequence box and click on Submit button.\nFor cloning in the pKLV2-U6gRNA5(BbsI)-PGKpuro2ABFP-W sgRNA expression plasmid, prepend the nucleotides “CACC” to the sense oligo and “AAAC” to the reverse complemented antisense oligo before ordering. Order premixed sense and anti-sense oligos in a 96-well plate labelled Oligo-Mix from an oligonucleotide synthesis company.",
    "NOTE: We have made use of the pKLV2-U6gRNA5(BbsI)-PGKpuro2ABFP-W plasmid, which has the BbsI restriction site for sgRNA cloning. In case other sgRNA expression plasmids are used, the overhangs used for the sgRNA oligonucleotides need to be changed accordingly.\nTake a separate U bottom 96-well plate labelled Annealing Plate. Make a master mix of 1 µL T4 PNK, 1 µL of 10x T4 DNA ligation buffer and 6 µL of water per annealing reaction.\nAdd 8 µL of the master mix to each well of the annealing plate. Add 1 µL of 100 µM each, sense and antisense oligo (or 2 µL of mixed sense-anti-sense oligos) to the master mix. Pipette 2–3 times gently to mix well, spin the plate briefly to get the mixes to the bottom of wells.\nUse the following annealing program on a PCR machine: 30 min at 37 °C, 2 min 30 s at 95 °C followed by slow cooling to 22 °C at the rate of 0.1 °C/s. After annealing, take a fresh 96-well plate labelled Diluted OligoMix. In this plate, dilute the phosphorylated and annealed oligos from the above reaction with water (1:200) using a multichannel pipette.\nDigest 5 µg of pKLV2-U6gRNA5(BbsI)-PGKpuro2ABFP-W vector with 1.5 µL of BbsI restriction enzyme (10,000 units/mL) using an appropriate buffer at 37 °C for 2 h to linearize it for ligation later.\nTake a fresh 96 well plate labelled Ligation Plate and add 20 ng of the BbsI digested pKLV2-U6gRNA5(BbsI)-PGKpuro2ABFP-W vector to one well per desired sgRNA ligation. To this, add 2 µL of phosphorylated, annealed oligos from the Diluted OligoMix plate.\nAdd 1 µL of 10x T4 ligase buffer and 1 µL of the T4 DNA Ligase enzyme. Gently pipette with a multichannel pipette and incubate the ligation mix at room temperature for 2 h.",
    "NOTE: Ligation mixes can be stored at -20 °C for the transformation step later.\nMeanwhile, thaw 90 µL of chemically competent E. coli cells on ice 10 min before the end of the ligation step.\nUsing a multichannel pipette, make 10 µL aliquots of the competent cells into each well of a separate 96 well plate.\nAdd the ligation mixture from Step 2.1.8 into the well containing the competent cells, pipette up and down gently and incubate for 10 min at room temperature.\nPipette 5 µL of the bacteria-DNA mix directly from the above reaction into a 6 well plate containing LB-agar with 100 µg/mL Ampicillin. Repeat for each of the transformation reactions.\nPlate each transformation reaction into a separately labelled well of a 6-well plate. Add approximately 5–8 glass beads to each well and shake the whole 6-well plate 8–10 times in a circular motion.\nPick 1–2 single colonies from each well with a sterile 20 µL pipette tip and streak it into a carefully labelled spot on a sterile 10 cm Petri-dish with LB agar and 100 μg/mL Ampicillin. After streaking into the LB plate, simply eject the tip used for clone streaking into 3 mL of LB-Ampicillin containing medium in a 14 mL round bottom tube marked with the corresponding bacterial clone number.\nSend the bacterial plate directly for Sanger sequencing with the Human U6 promoter forward primer.\nAfter sequence confirmation of cloned sgRNAs, purify the DNA from the corresponding 14 mL tube using a mini-prep kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nMeasure the concentration and quality of each of the mini-preps with a Spectrophotometer. Normalize each mini-prep to a concentration of 15 ng/µL and pipette into a 96 well plate labelled sgRNA Clones Plate.",
    "NOTE: This plate can be stored at -20 °C or used directly for virus preparation.\nViral production of sgRNA constructs and transduction\nFor the production of sgRNA lentiviral particles in the 96-well format, follow the “shRNA/sgRNA/ORF High Throughput Viral Production (96 well)” protocol from the Genetic Perturbation Platform (GPP web Portal) of the Broad Institute (URL: https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gpp/public/resources/protocols).\nTransfer 200 µL of viral supernatant to sterile tubes and freeze at -80 °C immediately.\nDay -1: Coat a flat bottom Non-tissue culture treated 96 well plate with 100 µL of recombinant human fibronectin fragment at a concentration of 10 µg/mL in a BSL2 cell culture hood. Wrap the plate using cling wrap to avoid evaporation loss and leave it at bench overnight.\nDay 0: Remove the recombinant human fibronectin fragment from each well. Thaw the viral supernatant of each sgRNA at room temperature. Add 50 µL of viral supernatant from each tube to each coated well of the transduction plate. Spin the transduction plate at 1,300 x g for 90 min at 35 °C.\nTowards the end of spinfection, count MOLM13-Cas9 (clone B3) cells from the culture flask. Use 10,000 cells per well in 100 µL volume. Count the cells for all the transduction wells, taking dead volume into consideration.\nAfter the 90 min spinfection, remove the supernatant from all the wells using a multichannel pipette adjusted to 50 µL slowly by tilting the plate. Add 100 µL of the culture of MOLM13-Cas9 clone B3 cells to each well slowly sliding down from the rim.\nSpin the plate at 1,300 x g for 2 min at 35 °C to let the cells settle onto the bottom. Transfer the plate to the 37 °C tissue culture grade incubator.",
    "Day 1: Add 100 µL of fresh medium to each well containing sgRNA transduced Cas9-MOLM13 or Cas9-MLL-AF9 leukemia cells such that the final medium volume is 200 µL.\n3. Competitive Growth Assay\nDay 3: 72 h (day 3) post transduction, check the percentage of sgRNA containing BFP positive cells in each well by flow cytometry (FACS). Use a cell viability dye to mark and exclude dead cells from the analysis.\nContinue re-plating a proportion of the cells into new wells with fresh medium after every FACS analysis to avoid overgrowth during the assay.\nRepeat the FACS analysis every 2–3 days to check the relative proportion of BFP positive (BFP+ve) cells compared to the BFP negative (BFP-ve) counterparts (Figure 3). Analyze the percentage of BFP positive cells for each time point (using the FlowJo or similar FACS analysis software).\nDrag Fcs files for each sample to FlowJo software. Double click on any one sample file and plot a dot blot of forward scatter (FSC) vs. Side scatter (SSC) with FSC on X axis and SSC on Y axis. Gate all the cells.\nDouble click on the gated cells and plot them on Viability stain (on Y axis) vs. FSC height (H) or Area (A) dot blot. Gate the viability stain negative (live) cells.\nDouble click on gated live cells and plot BFP (on Y axis) vs. FSC (A) on X axis. Gate BFP+ve cells. Apply all these gates to all the samples by dragging the selected sample to All Samples under Group tab.",
    "Click on Table Editor to make an analysis table of all the samples. Drag BFP+ve count from one sample to the table and click on the Display button in the Table Editor to create a batch report of all the samples with a table displaying the percentage of BFP+ve cells. Save the table as an xls.\nCalculate the proportional increase or decrease in % BFP positive cells within the live cell population over time and compare this ratio to the ratio of BFP positive cells in the control sgRNAs (such as luciferase, scrambled or GFP sgRNA).\nPlot the ratio of BFP positive cells for the different sgRNAs including the gene(s) of interest as well as controls using day 3 as the baseline.\nSubscription Required.
