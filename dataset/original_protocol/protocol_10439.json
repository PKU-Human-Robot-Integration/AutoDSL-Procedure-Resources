  "procedures": [
    "All methods described were reviewed and approved by the local human research ethics committee at Melbourne Health. Informed consent was obtained from the participant prior to the study.\n1. Equipment setup\nPrepare the electromagnetic motion tracker with 3 miniature motion sensors as per the manufacturer's guidelines. Prior to data collection, ensure each sensor is sampled at a minimum 250 Hz, displacement is measured in millimeter units and rotations (pitch, roll, and yaw) are in degrees. Ensure that all internal filterings are disabled, and the position of the sensors set to reference a static origin (usually the electromagnetic transmitter).\nAffix a load cell (minimum tension range 100 N, S-type recommended) to the patient harness at shoulder-level using a rope with a minimum diameter of 10 mm.\n\tNOTE: The harness system and rope are suitable for use in participants weighing up to 120 kg.\nConnect the load cell to data acquisition unit (A/D Converter).\nConnect the trigger output from the data acquisition unit into a trigger input of the motion tracker to ensure synchronized recording. Set data acquisition unit sampling rate to match the motion tracker and disable all filtering.\nConduct the experiment in a quiet room to minimize distractions during the assessment. Allow enough space for participants to take several corrective steps to regain balance.\n\tNOTE: Patients with Parkinson's disease and retropulsion are known to take 5-6 steps backward during the pull test.\nPlace falls mat on the floor as a precautionary measure.\nClean the harness, sensors, and wires with a hospital grade disinfectant wipe before testing each participant.\n\tNOTE: Video recording (e.g., using a portable camera on a tripod) of the instrumented pull test procedure is recommended so that any irregularities during data processing can be referenced against the video data of a trial.\n2. Participant selection and preparation",
    "Identify appropriate participants for study: participants can comprise a range of ages, disease conditions and severity where postural responses are of interest and balance assessment typically employs the clinical pull test. Ensure that participants can stand independently and generate a corrective balance response not requiring assistance to recover (i.e., up to Grade 1 postural instability according to the UPDRS).\nExclude any persons with cardiovascular, vestibular, vision and musculoskeletal conditions (including persons requiring foot orthotics or splints), that may impair balance performance unless this is the subject of the investigation, those on contact precautions, and those on medication known to affect balance or attention (e.g., antidepressants, neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, antiepileptics, antiarrhythmics, and diuretics).\nHave the participant wear comfortable loose clothing on the day of the experiment and remove shoes prior to the pull test procedure.\nAssist the participant in putting on the customized trunk harness with the load cell. Click the buckles around the chest and waist. Ensure adjustment straps on the harness are tight but comfortable. Do not allow more than 50 mm of slack in the harness when pulling on the rope. In participants with known postural instability, ensure that an assistant is present when the harness is applied while the participant is standing.\nAttach motion sensors using medical tape to the sternal notch (at the level of the second and third thoracic vertebra), and on the feet at the right and left ankle malleolus.\n\tNOTE: Apply the sensors on participants with known postural instability in sitting. All cables must be routed carefully to avoid trip hazards.",
    "Ask the participant to stand bare feet, in a comfortable stance (according to the participant's preferred base of support) along vertical and horizontal line markings on the floor. Note the participant's feet position. Ask the participant to also note their own feet position in order to revert to the same position after every pull. Monitor the participant's feet placement after every trial and ask the participant to return to the original feet position if any deviations are observed.\nInstruct the participant to focus on artwork 1.5 m ahead at the eye level with hands by their side to minimize distractions between pulls.\n3. Instrumented pull test procedure\nPerform the instrumented pull test in accordance with the clinical pull test guidelines described by the UPDRS5.\nExplain the test procedure, and let the participant know that stepping is allowed to regain balance following the backward pull. Discourage anticipatory responses such as forward trunk flexion, stiffening in posture or knee flexion prior to the pull. Note these responses if they occur during the experiment.\nPrior to each pull, ensure the participant is attentive by asking the participant to focus on a picture hanging on the wall. Ensure the participant is standing upright, with eyes open, hands by their side, and their feet placed on the designated markers in a comfortable stance.\nStand behind the participant. Apply a brisk pull of sufficient force to generate a trunk and step response via the rope and load cell held perpendicular to the shoulder level of the participant.\nAfter each pull ensure the participant returns to the original feet positioning. Reset the position back to designated markers on the floor and repeat 35 times.\n\tNOTE: The number of trials can be varied according to the experimental design and clinical population.",
    "Allow participants a short rest of 2 min after every 10 trials or as required to reduce the effects of fatigue and ensure attention is focused on the task. Participants can choose to sit or stand. Request that participants refrain from talking in between pulls unless requesting a break or expressing discomfort during the procedure.\nAs an additional safety precaution, ensure that the assessor and assistant are standing with their backs close to a wall while allowing enough room for the participant to take several steps backward.\n\tNOTE: The assessor must always be prepared to catch the patient. An assistant is required for safety when participants with known postural instability are assessed.\nDetach sensors and assist the participant out of the harness following completion of the instrumented pull test procedure.\n4. Signal processing\nNOTE: Use a suitable data science platform such as MATLAB, R, or Python. Commands shown here are for MATLAB and example code is available as Supplementary File.\nImport data recorded during step 3.4 into a suitable data science platform: csvread().\nAlign the motion tracker and load cell data using trigger signals and resample to a higher sampling rate: 1 kHz resample() function if required.\nHigh-pass filter all motion tracking and load cell data with a 0.05 Hz cut-off frequency to remove base-line drift: butter() and filtfilt().\nDouble differentiate the trunk motion tracking displacement data to obtain trunk velocity and acceleration: diff().\nUsing either the trigger signal or a peak-detection algorithm applied to the load cell data, slice recordings to obtain epochs of each individual pull test trial: findpeaks() function.",
    "Detect and reject trials with the anticipatory truncal movement. A forward trunk displacement immediately prior to the pull administration usually presents as a peak at least three standard deviations above the baseline mean of the trunk sensor: std() and mean().\nDetermine postural reaction time as the difference between the onset of trunk displacement (3 standard deviations above baseline mean) following the pull and the turning point of the trunk velocity curve (indicating the beginning of trunk deceleration): differentiate, diff(), and use zero crossing detector, zcd().\nDetermine the magnitude of the postural response as the peak deceleration of the trunk: min() or max().\nCalculate the step reaction time as the difference between the onset of truncal displacement (as per 4.7) to the initial movement of the stepping limb: 3 standard deviations above the baseline mean.\nDetermine the step response magnitude by calculating the total displacement of the foot in millimeters (mm), from initial foot lift-off to contact of the stepping limb arresting backward retropulsion. Exclude steps less than 50 mm, as the change in the base of support is considered negligible24: min() or max().\nCalculate the peak pull force and rate of force development from the load cell: max() for pull; max() and diff() for rate of force.\n\tNOTE: The peak pull force indicates the instantaneous maximum force delivered, whereas the force rate is the slope of the force versus time curve indicating how rapidly the force was generated.\nSubscription Required.
