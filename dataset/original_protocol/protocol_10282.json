    "The research described here was approved by the research ethics community at Sheffield Hallam University.\n1. Setup\nNOTE: Please refer to the attached R script provided as Supplementary File 1.\nLoad required packages (Rfacebook9, dplyr10, igraph11, and openxlsx12) in R. Packages refer to functions, datasets, or compiled code that allow users to analyze, transform, or extract data.\nLoad (external) retention and user data into R as a data frame from a CSV file.\n\tNOTE: Retention data refers to the number of days in which a client participates in the offline (traditional) addiction recovery program. It was provided by the administrator of the (offline) recovery program as recorded onto a CSV file with the participant name and number of days they have been involved in the program. The participant name was replaced by the anonymous ID number prior to being imported into R.\n2. Data extraction from the online community (the social page of an addiction recovery community)\nNOTE: This protocol applies to a social media page, but it can be adapted to different types of online communities. In the case of the Rfacebook package, it allows the user to extract data from the social media page into R.\nCreate a social media (Facebook) access token by following the guide on the referenced website13.\nCreate access token in R.\nUsing the “getGroup” function from Rfacebook, extract data from the social media page of the community of interest (e.g., content of post, number of comments and likes for each post, a unique ID number for each post, etc.). This data is then saved as a data frame.\n\tNOTE: A data frame is essentially a table within R used to store data.",
    "Using the “getPosts” function from Rfacebook, along with the Post IDs extracted in step 2.3, extract data about posts likes made on the page.\nUsing the “getPosts” function from Rfacebook, along with the Post IDs extracted in step 2.3, extract data on the comments made on each post (e.g., user IDs of people commenting the post, when the comment was made, how many likes the post received). This data is then saved as a data frame.\nUsing the comment IDs extracted in step 2.5, extract data on the “comment likes” made on each post (e.g., user IDs of people liking the comment). This data is then saved as a data frame.\nCombine the posts, post likes, comments, and comment likes data into one data frame.\nAdd a monthly breakdown (i.e., month 1 to 8).\n3. Calculation of social media activity made and received by each client\nCalculate the number of posts, comments, post likes and comment likes made by each client.\nCalculate the number of posts, comments, post likes and comment likes received by each client.\nJoin the data frame of social media activity made and received by each client to the retention data frame.\nCalculate the difference between posts and comments with likes and no likes.\nCalculate the difference between posts with comments and no comments.\nJoin the likes difference data to the retention data.\nJoin the comments difference data to the retention data.\nCalculate all the likes made by each client.\nCalculate all the likes received by each client.\nIdentify which users did not participate in social media group (i.e., no activity).\n4. Conducting social network analysis",
    "Create an edge list. An edge list is a list of relationships within the social network, which in this case is based on 1) liking posts and comments and 2) commenting on posts. This is done by looking at two columns within the dataset. The first column contains the anonymous ID of the person making the post, while the second contains the anonymous ID of the person liking or commenting on the post.\nCreate a vertex list. A vertex list is a list of all individuals in the group. This is done by converting the two columns in the list of relationships into one column, and removing duplicate anonymous IDs so only the unique anonymous ID is left.\nUsing the “graph.data.frame” and “get.adjacency” functions in the igraph package, create graph and graph matrix objects from the edge and vertex lists.\nUsing the “degree” and “betweenness” functions from the igraph package, obtain the network statistics (degree and betweenness) of the online group.\n5. Conducting computerized linguistic analysis in LIWC\nExport textual social media data (i.e., posts and comments) and post/comment ID column into CSV files.\nImport the CSV files of textual social media data into the Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) software.\nGenerate LIWC categories and save to new CSV files. Do this by clicking on “Analyze Text”, then on “Excel/CSV file”, and clicking on the column containing the posts and comments to select the text to be analyzed. After LIWC has completed analyzing the textual data, save the output as a new CSV file.\nImport the LIWC results CSV file into R, and merge with existing data. The data is matched by the post/comment ID column, which exists in both LIWC and existing data frames.",
    "Calculate total LIWC scores for each user in posts and comments, then join to the retention data.\nCalculate total LIWC scores for each user in all textual data (post and comments combined), then join to the retention data.\nRemove NAs from the retention data data frame.\n6. Conducting regression analysis (to determine if indicators of engagement with the online community predict retention in the offline recovery program)\nDefine the independent variables.\nUsing the “lm” function in base R, conduct linear regression analysis using the retention data as the dependent variable, and LIWC categories, comments, post likes, and comment likes as independent variables.\nCombine regression analysis results into one data frame.\n7. Creating monthly SNA maps\nPrepare data frames for SNA Maps.\nCreate an edge list based on monthly cumulative social media activity.\nCreate a vertex list based on monthly cumulative social media activity.\nCreate graphs and graph matrices based on monthly cumulative social media activity.\nSet the layout of SNA maps based on cumulative social media activity.\nAdd colors based on user roles.\nCreate SNA maps and save them to a file.\n8. Calculating monthly cumulative social media activity of the social media group\nCalculate monthly cumulative social media activity by staff, clients, and other members of the social media group.\nCalculate monthly cumulative social media activity by all members of the social media group.\nJoin the monthly cumulative social media activity data frames together."
