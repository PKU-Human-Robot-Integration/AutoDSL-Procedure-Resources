    "NOTE: All the surgical procedures performed on animals should be carried out in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (www.nap.edu/catalog/5140.html) or other appropriate ethical guidelines. Protocols should be approved by the animal welfare committee at the appropriate institution before proceeding.\n1. Preparation of animals\nPurchase male Japanese white rabbits (or rabbits with equivalent body size) weighing 2.7–3.0 kg.\nAcclimate the rabbits for 1 week in a 12 hour light–dark cycle and feed a regular rabbit chow diet before the procedure.\n2. Anesthesia and animal setting\nNOTE: All the subsequent procedures must be performed under aseptic conditions. The surgical field and devices should be disinfected with 10% povidone-iodine solution, 70% alcohol, or a quaternary ammonium compound before use.\nAnesthetize a rabbit with intravenous administration of pentobarbital sodium (25 mg/kg) via the auricular vein.\nAfter ensuring that the rabbit has lost its strength, transfer it to an operating table, and set it in the supine position. Cover the nose and mouth with an anesthetic mask. Start the administration of general anesthesia with the inhalation of 0.7–1.0% isoflurane-oxygen mix.\n\tNOTE: If the rabbit starts to move, a temporal surge in isoflurane up to 2% will be effective.\nTrim the fur on the neck and shoulder using an electric hair clipper. After disinfecting the surface by spraying 70% ethanol or another antiseptic solution, shave the rest of the hair in the cervical region with a razor. Disinfect the surgical field with 10% povidone-iodine and administer lidocaine hydrochloride (3 mg/kg) subcutaneously as local anesthesia.\n\tNOTE: Examine the repetitive movement of the trachea. Observe the pulsation of the jugular vein and the carotid artery. When the respiratory and pulsatile rates decrease, consider a temporary reduction in anesthesia administration. Monitoring the percutaneous oxygen saturation and pulse rate is also helpful.",
    "NOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\n3. Harvest of the jugular vein\nNOTE: Local anesthetics (such as lidocaine) should be used before making the skin incision.\nBefore skin incision, administer prophylactic enrofloxacin (5 mg/kg) subcutaneously. For analgesia, administer 0.05 mg/kg of buprenorphine subcutaneously twice a day for 3 days.\n\tNOTE: To avoid a drop in body temperature, a surgical scrub of the incision site can be used instead of spraying the animal's body with 70% ethanol.\nIncise 50–60 mm of the cervical region with surgical scalpel longitudinally. Bluntly dissect the subcutaneous tissues and fascia to expose a 20–30 mm segment of the jugular vein. Ligate all the branches of the exposed vein with 4-0 silk sutures.\nPlace a 2-0 silk suture around the internal and external jugular veins to perform ligation immediately after incising the jugular vein in the next step.\nIncise the venous wall (approximately 1 mm) of the distal side of the vein. Insert a 2-French balloon catheter from the cut toward the proximal side of the vein. Ligate the 2-0 silk suture at the distal sites of the jugular veins.\nInflate the balloon with 0.2 mL of air. Denude the intima of the vein using three passages of the catheter for endothelial exfoliation.\n\tNOTE: This procedure is considered equivalent to the distension of a saphenous vein graft in human revascularization surgeries, which causes endothelial exfoliation.\nLigate the proximal end of the vein. Cut the vein to harvest.\n\tNOTE: Carefully distinguish the distal and proximal end of the harvested vein, because the anastomosis to the artery should be performed in an inverted manner (i.e., the distal end of the vein should be anastomosed to the proximal end of the artery). For example, insertion of an intravenous catheter from a certain side would work as a marker.",
    "For therapeutic manipulations for the harvested jugular vein, treat the harvested vein with methods designed for each research question (e.g., electroporation26 or direct immersion with solutions27 for transducing microRNAs into the veins).\n\tNOTE: For this protocol, the vein grafts were soaked in phosphate-buffered saline, control microRNA, and microRNA-145. The protocol can be paused here.\n4. Interposing the carotid artery by the harvested jugular vein\nExpose a 20–30 mm segment of the ipsilateral carotid artery. Separate the artery carefully from the vein and nerve nearby. Ligate all the branches of the exposed vein with 4-0 silk suture.\nAdminister heparin sodium intravenously (200 IU/kg). Wait for 3–4 min.\nClamp the proximal and distal ends of the artery with surgical clamps. Cut the artery in the middle, between the clamps. Inject normal saline into the incised carotid artery proximally and distally to distend the artery.\n\tNOTE: A rabbit carotid artery tends to shrink. Choose a well-distended site as an anastomosis site.\nAnastomose the harvested vein to the artery in a reversed end-to-end fashion.\n\t\nInsert a 20 G intravenous catheter into the harvested vein from the distal to the proximal direction to keep the venous lumen open during the distal anastomosis.\nAnastomose the proximal end of the vein to the distal end of the artery using 8-0 polypropylene interrupted sutures. Place two anchor stiches at the site and the opposite site. Add stiches the upper side of the anastomosis line between the anchor stiches.\nFlip the artery and the vein graft upside down. Add stiches on the remaining part of the anastomosis line.\nRemove the intravenous catheter from the vein. Clamp the vein graft proximally and declamp the carotid artery distally. Ascertain that the vein graft is expanding gradually.",
    "Anastomose the distal end of the vein to the proximal end of artery using 8-0 polypropylene interrupted sutures. Declamp the artery to check the bleeding from the anastomosis sites. Add sutures for hemostasis, if required.\n\t\tNOTE: A gentle compression of the bleeding site with gauze and waiting may be enough for hemostasis. Check the immediate expansion and strong pulsation of the vein graft after the proximal declamping. If that is not observed, consider repeating steps 4.4.2–4.4.3\nLigate the internal carotid artery with a 4-0 silk suture to simulate a poor runoff condition and to facilitate intimal hyperplasia.\nClean the wound with saline. Close the wound using 3-0 polyglactin 910, layer by layer.\n5. Postoperative procedures\nEnd the anesthesia and remove the anesthesia mask after checking the spontaneous breathing of the animal. Check the conditions of the animal frequently until it recovers from anesthesia.\nKeep the animal separated from other animals until respiratory function is fully restored. Support breathing manually, if necessary. Do not return the animal to a larger group until full recovery.\nCheck the food and water intake after recovery from anesthesia and provide appropriate nutritional support. Administer analgesics (e.g., buprenorphine 0.05–0.2 mg/kg subcutaneously 2x a day for 3 days) and check for signs of discomfort or pain.\nSubscription Required.
