    "Note: All procedures here are described for a Bruker Multimode AFM, for different models and brands of AFM the protocol will need to be adapted according to the manufactures instructions. Loading the sample and setting up the AFMModern AFM instruments have a multitude of different imaging modes to choose from including contact mode, non-contact mode and tapping mode. For delicate soft materials or biomaterials such as this, it is important to minimize the force exerted on the substrate by the AFM tip to prevent the surface being damaged. Tapping mode AFM (TM-AFM) achieves this by intermediately tapping the substrate, and not dragging the hard, sharp tip of the AFM cantilever across the substrate as in contact mode AFM. For this reason, all imaging on these amyloid fibril networks should be performed in TM-AFM.Amyloid fibril networks are fabricated by exposing globular proteins (typically β-lactoglobulin or hen egg white lysozyme) to high temperatures and low pH which causes the proteins to be hydrolyzed into peptide fragments.Over time the fragments self-assemble into amyloid fibrils (see Charnley et al. [2018] for a detailed protocol on fabricating these networks). The freshly prepared amyloid fibril networks can be deposited on mica via a simple drop-casting protocol (see Charnley et al. [2018]) and can now be attached to the magnetic AFM stub using one of the double-sided sticky dots. Carefully mount the sample onto the AFM (Figure 1a) ensuring not to damage the mirror in the top left of the sample loading area.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180210/20180210210733_2416.jpgFigure 1.

Now load the AFM cantilever holder into the AFM, ensuring that the sample is not too high, which would cause the cantilever to crash into the sample. Ensure that the AFM is in AFM mode (not STM or TM-AFM).     <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p>   Video 1. Loading AFM cantilever into the cantilever holder  Focus the optical microscope on the AFM to the cantilever and ensure that it is mounted straight and not at an angle (Figures 2b and 2c). Refocus the camera on the surface of the mica sheet.Note: Take care that you are focussed on the uppermost surface, to prevent crashing the cantilever into the substrate. Move the sample upwards (or AFM tip downwards depending on the AFM model) so that it is close to the mica substrate, the distance from the substrate can be judged by looking at the separation between the AFM tip and its reflection (Figure 2d).",
    "Focus the AFM laser spot on the cantilever (Figure 1c), maximizing the obtained Sum (it should be around 7 for an RTESPA300 tip), but also ensuring that the laser spot is close to the tip of the cantilever and not significantly over one edge (Figure 2e). Note: To maximize the Sum both the laser position (Figure 1c) and the angle of the mirror (Figure 1f) that focusses the laser onto the 4 quadrant photodiode within the AFM may need to be adjusted.After correctly positioning the laser spot onto the AFM cantilever, the 4 quadrant photodiode should be adjusted so that both the vertical and horizontal deflection reads as zero (Figure 1dvert and 1dhor). Once correctly adjusted the AFM should be switched to TM-AFM mode (using the switch on the base of the instrument) and the horizontal deflection reset to zero if required. Note: Upon switching to TM-AFM the vertical deflection will have disappeared and have been replaced with the RMS value. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180210/20180210211017_4017.jpgFigure 2.

    "This can be done in the setup menu of the AFM software (within the soft tapping mode experimental pre-set). As this imaging is being performed in air, the autotune software (Figure 3) works well however, the user should ensure that autotune is set up to scan across the correct frequency range (200-400 kHz works well for the RTESPA300 cantilevers) and that the target amplitude is sufficient (500 mV is a good place to start) (see Figure 3). Note: When tuning the cantilever to find the precise resonant frequency ensure that the cantilever is sufficiently far away from the surface so that the resonant frequency is not influenced by sample-tip interactions. Upon clicking execute in the autotune menu, the software should correctly identify the resonant frequency of the cantilever (likely to be somewhere between 270-330 kHz for RTESPA300 cantilevers) and fix the amplitude to the chosen target amplitude (see Figure 3). If the software cannot identify a resonant frequency or it looks suspicious (i.e., > ± 50 kHz from the quoted resonant frequency, and/or not obviously the most intense peak) then Steps A2-A5 may need to be repeated or the cantilever may be damaged.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180210/20180210211151_7095.jpgFigure 3. Cantilever tuning. The resonant frequency and phase shift should look approximately like the examples given above with one major peak around (± 50 kHz) the quoted resonant frequency of the cantilever (in this case 300 kHz). Particular attention should be given to the highlighted parameters, the start and end frequency should include the expected resonant frequency (300 kHz) and the desired target amplitude should be selected (for amyloid fibrils 500-1,000 mV works well).Imaging the amyloid fibril networks Maximum available resolution in the AFM will depend on a large variety of factors (tip quality, instrument noise, external noise, the piezo scanner used etc.).",
    "This protocol described uses a relatively high resolution ‘e’ scanner, which sacrifices available scan size for increased lateral resolution, thus maximum scan sizes are around 10 μm. Other piezo scanners and other models of AFM will allow for bigger scan sizes (up to hundreds of microns in some cases).Ensure that the AFM cantilever is close to the substrate interface (Figure 2e), select a scan rate (~1 Hz), scan size (1-10 μm) and an image resolution (512 x 512 pixels for publication quality images) and engage the cantilever from the scan menu in the software. The sample will now automatically be moved (initially via a stepper motor, and later by a piezo motor), until the cantilever and substrate come into contact. Occasionally a false engage occurs when the cantilever fails to come into contact with the surface, if this happens multiple times then Steps A2-A5 above may need to be repeated or the tip may be damaged. The most important parameter to be optimised once the cantilever in contact with the substrate is the amplitude setpoint. The amplitude setpoint approximates to the force exerted by the tip on the sample (lower voltage = higher force exerted), and is automatically set to an initial value of 50% of the target amplitude. Once scanning has commenced the amplitude setpoint can be adjusted so that the tip closely tracks overall features on the surface. This can be assessed by looking at the trace and retrace line scans in the topography channel (Figure 4b). These should be exactly overlapping, if they are not then the amplitude setpoint should be reduced. An optimum amplitude setpoint is achieved when the AFM is just tracking the surface (in trace and retrace directions), but the force exerted on the sample is minimized (Figure 4).",
    "At this stage, if required, the drive amplitude and drive frequency can also be optimized to further improve the quality of the image. Finally adjust the integral (IG) and proportional gain (PG) so that the noise in all of the channels is minimised. The amplitude error channel (channel 2 by default) most clearly shows noise therefore this channel should be used to fine tune the IG and PG. Typically as the gains are increased a reduction in noise is observed until an upper limit is reached, beyond which additional electrical noise is introduced into the image. As a rule of thumb, the PG should always be 2-3 greater than the IG (Figure 4c). Once satisfied with the image quality, restart the scan, set the file name and directory and turn on capture to record the image. Examples of both good and bad scanning parameters are shown in Figure 4.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180210/20180210211429_8629.jpgFigure 4.
