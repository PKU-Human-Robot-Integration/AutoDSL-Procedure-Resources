    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nL1 larvae treatment and fixation\nTiming: 15–20 min\nThe following procedure is optimized for investigating the early time window of PGC development with or without DNA damaging agents (e.g., UVB irradiation, 25 mJ/cm2). In response to UV treatment, for instance, the growth of L1 worms may be retarded when nucleotide excision repair machinery is compromised as in the case of xpc-1 mutant strain. In general, the more advanced the worm develop, the easier the fixative step.\nSynchronize worms with genetic background of interest at the L1 larval stage before subjected to treatment, e.g., UVB irradiation.\nPlate fixed number of L1 worms (suspended in M9 buffer) in NGM plates corresponding to the area of plates. For example, a 3.5-cm NGM plate can reside 6000 L1 worms.\nOnce the buffer dries and worms settled, initiate treating process as required and incubate worms at 20°C after feeding worms with concentrated OP 50.\nNote: Nutritional cues are essential for initiating the development of PGCs (Fukuyama et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Sulston et al., 1983[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nHarvest worms at the desired time point by rinsing plates with M9 buffer and collect in a sealed 15-mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 800–1000 × g for 2–3 min to spin down worms.\nCritical: Centrifuge at lower speed/shorter time may lead to lower harvest of worms/samples while centrifuge at higher speed/longer time may retain too much bacteria that interferes with further procedure and causes strong background after staining.\nRemove supernatant as much as possible without disturbing settled worms.\nPrepare Fixing buffer according to volume required and aliquot 5 μl in a 0.2-mL tube.\nCritical: Prepare the fixing buffer fresh at 20°C–22°C and use within one day.\nAlternatives: 10× Egg buffer can be replaced with aforementioned M9 buffer.",
    "Transfer 5 μl of worms to the 0.2-mL tube containing Fixing buffer and mix gently with pipetting 5 times.\nTransfer 5 μl of mixture to a HistoBond®+ Adhesion Microscope slide (with 1 ring white) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, left panel).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/570-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Demonstration of critical steps in immunostaining of L1 larva\n(A) Fixation of L1 larva. Once applying the coverslip, press gently around the edge as indicated by the green arrows.\n(B) Permeabilization of specimen with freeze-cracking. The slide should be frozen for performing freeze-cracking. Flip off the coverslip in the direction indicated using fingers.\nNote: We recommend using slides with printed rings or wells in order to avoid crashing worms when applying pressure on specimens in the following step.\nAlternatives: This protocol also works with hydrophobic PTFE printed microscope slides with 3 × 14 mm wells (Fisher Scientific) that are pretreated with 0.3% poly-L-lysine.\nAttach a 24 × 24-mm coverslip to the drop, preferably unparallel to the slide (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, middle panel), and press around the edge (white ring) while incubating 2 min at 20°C–22°C (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, right panel).\nCritical: Apply the coverslip carefully to avoid air bubbles, which will reduce the contact between slide surface and worms, decreasing the worm attachment as well as the efficiency of permeabilization via freeze-cracking.\nCritical: Gently press the coverslip around the ring during the 2-min incubation. This help L1 worms to attach better to the slide, hence reducing potential loss during further steps. Do not let the coverslip-slide slip over one another, which twists the worms (Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nMove slides carefully into the box with dry ice and leave for at least 10 min or until thoroughly frozen and proceed to the next step.",
    "Note: Do not replace dry ice with liquid nitrogen as bubbles generated in the latter might disturb the slides, resulting in cracking of the coverslips.\nNote: Despite being a “Pause point” in the general practice of immunostaining worms in later developmental stages, we recommend strongly to proceed directly to the following steps, avoiding storing samples at −80°C, which might potentially compromise the sample.\nFreeze-cracking and penetration\nTiming: 40 min\nImmunostaining relies on antibody recognizing and binding to specific antigens. The cuticle of nematodes, however, becomes a barrier for efficient antibody penetration to the tissue. Combining methanol treatment and freeze-cracking facilitates permeabilization while minimizing morphological disruptions when performing staining in L1 larva. For more detailed discussion and application of freeze-cracking in immunostaining, please refer to a comprehensive review for freeze-cracking (Duerr, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nPrechill 100% methanol in a coplin jar (50–100 mL depending on the jar size) at −20°C.\nTake out frozen slide (one each time), and flip the coverslip using fingertip (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nCritical: Freeze-crack the slide when it is still frozen; defrosted slide is not optimal for this step (Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nImmediately immerse the slide in the ice cold methanol and incubate for 10 min.\nNote: Methanol is toxic. Please handle under a fume hood with gloves.\nNote: Carefully place following slides to prevent them from overlapping with one another.\nRemove slides from the methanol and wash them in a staining container with PBST buffer for 10 min.\nRepeat washing with refreshed PBST two more times to remove any residual methanol.\nBlocking, antibody incubation, and mounting\nTiming: 2 days",
    "As soon as the fixation and permeabilization is completed, the slides are now ready for antibody incubation. To eliminate unspecific binding and thereby unfavorable background, a blocking step with normal serum depending on the host species of secondary antibodies, e.g., donkey serum in this protocol, is strongly recommended prior to incubation with primary antibodies (Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nWipe slides with kimwipes around the white ring without disturbing the attached worms.\nNote: This prevents the solution from dispersing all over the slide during the blocking procedure.\nPrepare a humid chamber, ideally a light-protective chamber, with damped paper towels.\nPlace wiped slides in the chamber with specimen side facing up and block with 50 μl PBST containing 10% donkey serum for 30 min at 20°C–22°C.\nBinding of primary antibodies:\nDilute primary antibody in PBST with 10% donkey serum. In this case, CEP-1 antibody (Schumacher et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) is used for the detection of p53 homolog in worms with the dilution of 1:300 while PGL-3 is used as markers of PGCs with the dilution of 1:10000.\nAlternatively, RAD-51, a pivotal factor involved in homologous recombination (Baumann and West, 1998[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), can be used for detecting the presence of double-stranded breaks with the dilution of 1:350.\nUse 50 μl per slide for incubation in a humid chamber at 4°C for at least 16 h.\nWash slides in a staining container with PBST buffer for 10 min.\nRepeat the washing with refreshed PBST two more times for 3 washes in total.\nWipe slides with kimwipes around the white ring to remove excessive solution.\nBinding of secondary antibodies:\nDilute secondary antibodies in PBST with 10% donkey serum according to the corresponding primary antibodies and detecting channels desired. For example, we use anti-goat IgG DyLight 594 and anti-rat IgG Alexa 488 for detecting CEP-1 and PGL-3, respectively.",
    "All secondary antibodies are used with the dilution of 1:350.\nUse 50 μl per slide for incubation in a humid and light-protective chamber at 20°C–22°C for 2 h.\nWash slides in a staining container with PBST buffer for 10 min × 3 times.\nWipe slides with kimwipes around the white ring to remove excessive solution.\nPlace a coverslip with thickness compatible for confocal microscopy [#1.5 (0.17 mm)] on a flat surface.\nTransfer around 15 μl of DAPI Fluoromount-G® mounting medium on top of the coverslip laying on a steady rack.\nAlternatives: Histone H3 (1:100 dilution) can be used for replacing DAPI as a co-staining control for intensity normalization.\nApply the slide with specimen side gently on the mounting medium until the medium disperse over the whole area.\nPlace the mounted slide with specimen facing-up in a light-protective chamber or drawer. Leave for 24 h or until the mounting medium is dry.\nSeal the slides with durable sealing reagent such as coverslip sealant or nail polish. The slides are then ready for microscopy imaging.\nNote: To preserve the signals of immunostaining, store slides light-protected at 4°C if imaged in few days, or store slides at −20°C for extended storage."
