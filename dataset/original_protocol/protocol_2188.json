    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nFictive cold rearing in the OptoBox\nTiming: 1–10 days (depending on desired life stage and ambient temperature)\nNote: The flies you use will depend upon your experimental design, as this setup can be adapted for chronic optogenetic activation of any number or type of neurons. In our study (Himmel et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]), we made use of flies expressing UAS-ChETA::YFP under the control of GAL419-12, which targets Class III (CIII) neurons. CIII neurons are a segmentally-repeated class of peripheral noxious cold-sensing neurons (cold nociceptors). Here, we compared animals of the same genotype (GAL4-19-12 > UAS-ChETA::YFP), where the control group did not receive all-trans-retinol, a necessary cofactor for ChETA function. The goal of this experiment was to determine whether chronic activation of CIII nociceptors, in the absence of cold, had any effect on the ability of animals to survive subsequent cold shocks. This protocol is inspired by a similar approach employed by Kaneko et al. (2017)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] for studying (de)sensitization of mechanical/high temperature nociceptors and can be feasibly adapted to study any number of systems.\nPrepare housing for Drosophila.\nPrepare Drosophila food (according to your laboratory/experimental needs); while the food is still liquid (approximately 45°C–50°C), use a pipette to transfer 2.5 mL of food to a 60 × 15 mm Petri dish.\nThe food must be spread thin to be sure animals receive full doses of optogenetic light during their stay in the OptoBox (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nFor experimental animals, before pouring food use a micropipette to add all-trans-retinol (ATR). Bring the final concentration of ATR in the food to 1.5 mM.",
    "Note: This protocol assumes two groups of the same genotype, where the presence of ATR (and thus active ChETA) is the independent variable. It may be desirable to also control for the presence of ATR, and thus to also use a wild-type or genetic-background control strain which is fed ATR.\nOnce the food has cooled and solidified, introduce ∼15 adult Drosophila to the Petri dish. Anesthetize adult flies with carbon dioxide, then place the adults on the lid of the plastic dish, closing the dish with the base/food on top. Once adults are mobile, flip the dish and keep it food-side down.\nHouse the dish in a dark, temperature-controlled area.\nAfter allowing for egg-lay (no longer than 24 h), remove adults from the dish (by aspiration or by simply releasing them in a controlled area). Leaving adults in the dish may lead to too much food being eaten before larvae mature.\nMonitor the plates until your life-stage of interest is present. Closely monitor the quality of the food over time (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nNote: Alternatively to steps 2–5, eggs, larvae, or adults can be transferred to the dish, and subsequently to the OptoBox, at the desired life stage.\nTransfer each of the plates, in the dark, to an OptoBox compartment. Close the OptoBox compartment and start the Arduino microcontroller.\nAfter a length of time determined by your experimental design, remove each Petri dish and continue at either step 8 (larval dissection and single unit electrophysiological recordings[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2]) or step 13 (cold-tolerance assay by cold plate[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3]).\nNote: Following fictive cold acclimation, one might also perform behavioral analyses by either the cold-plate (Himmel et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Patel and Cox, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) or cold-probe assays (Turner et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]), as previously described.\nLarval dissection and single unit electrophysiological recordings\nTiming: 2 h (to recording)",
    "Using the protocol below, one can record cold-evoked electrophysiological activity in larval CIII neurons (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Ideally, one will be able to visualize neurons of interest using fluorescence microscopy; in the linked study, CIII neurons were visualized by GAL419-12>UAS-mCD8::GFP.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1798-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Electrophysiology prep\n(A) The dish is constantly superfused with gravity-dripped physiological saline. The tube carrying the saline splits into two paths via a three-way stopcock (circled arrow), one (In) leading directly to the experimental chamber and the other via the cooler. The saline solution is aspirated and drained from the opposite edge by an outlet tube (Out) connected to a vacuum. After pinning the specimen at the center of the chamber, two flow guides made of Sylgard resin are installed to ensure that the fluid will pass straight through. The temperature of the cooler is directly controlled by the temperature controller, which is operated manually by operator or by an command waveform produced by the computer (PC) via an A/D converter.",
    "(B) For the experiment, the fillet preparation is pinned in the center of the oval chamber. The inlet (In) and outlet (Out) tubes are placed at both ends of the chamber, and the tube that comes out of the cooler (Cold) is placed closer to the specimen. The grounding Ag-AgCl wire (Ground) is placed in the corner of the chamber and the thermometer probe (Thermo.) is placed near the outlet of the cooler.\n(C) Photo of the chamber.\nPrepare HL-3 saline for use throughout. Prepare 4 L of solution.\nSelect and fillet the larva:\nArrange larva ventral-side up on the bottom of the experimental chamber (dish) by pinning the anterior and posterior ends of the body with 1–2 mm tungsten micropins (previously made).\nUsing dissection scissors, cut open the ventral body wall of the final posterior segment horizontally, then cut longitudinally in a straight line toward the anterior.\nFill the experimental chamber with approximately 0.5 mL of HL-3 saline (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nSpread the body wall and pin it onto the Sylgard floor of the experimental chamber.\nLoosen the internal organs (brain, intestine, salivary glands, tracheae, and fat tissues) by gently pipetting, then remove them with micro-scissors and forceps.\nUsing a tungsten needle and dissection scissors, remove the dorsal longitudinal muscles to expose the dorsal cluster of sensory neurons. Insert a micro pin (glued to the top of a toothpick) under the dorsal longitudinal (DL) and dorsal oblique (DO) muscle to lift them (Zarin et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]), and then sever with fine scissors (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D). The severed muscles will contract by themselves, exposing the underlying sensory neurons (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 3C).\nPlace the experimental chamber housing the fillet prep in the electrophysiology rig.\nPlace the flow guides (previously made) on either side of the fillet preparation (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).",
    "Place the saline inlet and aspiration/outlet tubes at both ends of the experimental chamber. Connect the outlet tube to a vacuum.\nPlace the cooler outlet tube upstream of the fillet prep; the length of the outlet tube should be approximately 2 cm.\nPrepare for electrophysiological recordings.\nMake a patch pipette with a tip diameter of 5–10 micrometers by pulling borosilicate glass (1.0 mm out diameter, 0.75 mm inner diameter) using a programmable electrode puller (Brown et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). The program for P-97 consists of 3 lines, and each line setting is Heat 285, Pull 0, Velocity 45, Time 150, Pressure 500.\nFill the pipette with saline filtered through a 0.45 micron syringe filter.\nMount the pipette on an electrode holder containing an Ag-AgCl wire and a suction tube attachment and connect to an amplifier head-stage fixed on a micromanipulator.\nConnect the electrode holder to a 5 mL syringe with a polyethylene tube.\nNote: Although we used GAL419-12 in the linked study, CIII neurons can be visualized by fluorescence microscopy in larvae expressing UAS-mCD8::GFP under the control of GAL419-12, GAL4nompC, or any other GAL4 driver targeting neurons of interest (e.g., Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nWhile applying positive pressure with a syringe, bring the electrode close to the target cell body on the body wall (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nWhen the tip touches the target cell body, slowly apply negative pressure to draw the cell body into the pipette (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nRecord spiking activity. Here, we used a Multiclamp 700A amplifier under voltage-clamp mode held at 0 mV, filtering out high frequency noise of the current signal with a 3 kHz low-pass filter. The output signals of the amplifier were digitized at a sample frequency of 10 kHz using an A/D converter (Micro1401-4). The data were acquired to a PC running Spike2 software.",
    "Record spiking under chilling. Two different methods can be used to apply cold stimulus while recording spiking activity from a CIII neuron. One approach (a) is to switch perfusates from the saline held at room temperature (approximately 22°C–25°C) to one pre-chilled to the desired temperature (fast-stimulation protocol). The other method (b) is to directly control the perfusate by sending a command voltage waveform to the temperature control device (slow-stimulation protocol).\nFor the room-temperature condition, the preparation should be continuously superfused with saline at room temperature.\nFor Fast-Stimulation Protocol:\nSet the Warner Instrument CL-100 temperature controller to the target temperature in advance to chill saline to desired stimulus temperature.\nTurn the valve of the three-way stopcock within 0.2 s the saline temperature in the test chamber will sharply drop.\nFor Slow-Stimulation Protocol:\nSet the CL-100 temperature controller to the desired stimulus temperature.\nNote: The graphical sequence editor function of Spike2 software allows the user to input the amplitude potential of the rectangular output waveform and the speed of potential change (V/sec) to create a commanded direct waveform of temperature change. The command output can be directly fed to the temperature controller (CL-100) as a voltage signal from DAC output of the data acquisition interface (A/D converter).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1.

    "By modifying the previously described cold-plate behavior assay (Himmel et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Patel and Cox, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]), one can deliver cold-shocks to large batches of larvae as part of a cold-tolerance assay (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]), a method which assesses the ability of larvae to survive cold shocks. In the linked experimental paper, we studied the ability of wandering 3rd instar larvae to survive 1-h cold shocks at 0°C, following real and fictive cold acclimation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1798-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Wiring diagram and cold shock setup\nThe cold shock apparatus for use in the cold-tolerance assay is made up of a TE Technology thermoelectric cooling device (TC-48-20), a TE Technology Peltier plate (cold plate; CP-031), and a TE Technology power source plugged into a standard wall outlet. Larvae are placed on a thin aluminum shim, which is set on top of the Peltier plate for the length of the cold shock.\n(A) Schematic with wiring instructions.\n(B) Photo of complete apparatus.\nPrechill the Peltier device by setting the temperature controller to the target temperature (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nCollect living larvae of your desired life stage and wash them.\nUsing a paint brush, gently collect larvae from the dish and place them in the well of a 9-well glass plate. Use tap water and a glass pipette to gently wash residual food off of the larvae.\nTransfer the larvae to a dry Kimwipe (or other equivalent paper wipe) to dry off excess water. Leave them on the now moistened wipe as you prepare the aluminum shim arena.",
    "Note: Some of the sensory neurons which control cold sensing are also touch sensors (Turner et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). Use single, deliberate motions with each brush movement to transport larvae from one position to another. It is currently unknown if and how repeated touches may affect cold acclimation. We therefore advise you to discard larvae which you drop or deliver additional, accidental touches to.\nQuickly transfer larvae to the aluminum shim arena. Larvae can be placed in the center of the plate and allowed to locomote out to roughly equal distances from one another. Approximately 30 larvae can fit on the plate, but the final number of larvae and biological replicates (individual test populations from different dishes) will depend upon your experimental design.\nNote: At cold temperatures larval locomotion will cease and will not resume until after chilling has ceased and larvae begin to warm.\nTransfer the aluminum shim arena to the prechilled cold plate (Peltier device).\nSet a timer for the length of time desired for the cold shock (e.g., 1 h).\nWhile the larvae are being cold shocked, prepare fresh fly vials to house larvae post cold shock. Each vial should contain equal amounts of food from the same food batch (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nAfter the cold shock, move larvae one by one into their new fly vial, gently depositing them on the wall of the vial. Maintain the vials at room temperature and monitor them (Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).\nIf you began with wandering 3rd instar larvae, approximately 4 days later adults should emerge from pupal casings. Count the number of adults which emerge and compare to the initial number of larvae.\nThe survival rate is calculated by # survivor adults/# larvae initially shocked."
