    "**A) CVS Treatment:**\nCVS are treated with nitric acid o/n, briefly washed with H<sub>2</sub>O \\(5x + 4x 30 min) and spread separately on Whatmann paper to dry. Dry CVS are baked in the oven \\(165 <sup>o</sup>C; o/n)\n**B) Coating:**\n1. Place CVS into 24-well plates \\(sterile)\n  2. Coat CVS with 400&#x3BC;l/well poly-D-lysine in Borate-Buffer \\(1mg/ml; sterile filtered) for &gt; 5 hrs into the incubator.\n  3. wash CVS 3x with H<sub>2</sub>O and let them dry in the hood\n  4. coat with 5&#x3BC;g/ml laminin in PBS for &gt; 2 hrs into the incubator \\(400&#x3BC;l/well) \n  5. wash 3x with PBS, replace it with NB medium \\(400&#x3BC;l/well) and put it into the incubator\n  \n**C) Isolation of Hippocampal Neurons \\(adapted from Jenny Lauterbach - ref 1):**\n1. put 4ml of SM and 4ml of NB medium each in a dish to pre-warm it in the incubator\n  2. pre-warm trypsin at 37 <sup>o</sup>C in the water bath\n  3. take E18-19 embryos from rat, cut off the heads and collect them in a dish with chilled dissection medium \\(DM)\n  4. carefully open the skull, remove the brains and transfer them into a new dish with chilled DM\n  5. separate the 2 cortices from the rest of the brain, remove their meninges and cut out each hippocampus; collect hippocampi in a 15ml tube filled with 10ml DM on ice\n  6. remove DM, replace it with 1-2ml warmed trypsin and incubate 20 min at 37 <sup>o</sup>C in the water bath\n  7. flame Pasteur pipette to decrease the diameter of the tip, take off the trypsin and wash hippocampi 2x with 1ml warm SM\n  8. add 1.5ml SM and homogenize tissue with the fire-polished Pasteur pipette  by pipetting up and down 20-30x\n  9. centrifuge 5 min at 80g \\(650rpm)",
    "10.  remove supernatant, resuspend neurons in 1-3ml pre-warmed NB medium using the fire-polished Pasteur pipette\n  11. count cells, and plate them at designated cell density \\(e.g. high density 25,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> ) on prepared CVS\n  \n**D) Calcium Phosphate Transfection \\(general protocol)** \nMix for 4 wells \\(24-well plate): \n900&#x3BC;l fresh NB medium \n100&#x3BC;l Transfection Mix containing: \\(37.5 &#x3BC;l H<sub>2</sub>O &#x2013; DNA \\(4-7&#x3BC;g) + 12.5 &#x3BC;l 1M CaCl<sub>2</sub> + 50 &#x3BC;l BBS)\n1. mix H<sub>2</sub>O with CaCl<sub>2</sub> \n  2. add DNA, mix by slowly pipetting \n  3. add BBS to DNA-H<sub>2</sub>O-CaCl<sub>2</sub>-mix\n  4. mix with 900 &#x3BC;l warm NB medium by vortexing\n  5. take away the old medium from the cells and quickly apply 250&#x3BC;l of the transfection-medium mix to each of the 4 wells.\n  6. incubate for 1.5-2.5 hrs\n  7. warm up HBSS for washing\n  8. wash cells with pre-warmed HBSS until most of the precipitate is removed\n  9. add 300 &#x3BC;l of NB medium per well to the cells\n  10. stimulate 2 days later\n  \n**E) Stimulation/Fixation:**\n1.  cluster EphB- Fc, ephrinb-Fc or Fc one hour prior stimulation at RT: Mix EphB/ephrin 4 &#x3BC;g/ml + 1/20 anti-hFc \\(0.2 &#x3BC;g/ml) \n  e.g.: 300&#x3BC;l medium/well: take 6 &#x3BC;l EphB2/ephrinB2 + 0.325 &#x3BC;l anti-hFc \\(1/10)\n2. stimulate the cells with clustered EphB2, ephrinB2 or Fc by adding the appropriate amount \\(4&#x3BC;g/ml) into the wells for 8 hrs in the incubator\n  3. put cells on ice to stop reaction\n  4. remove the medium and fix the cells by adding 200 &#x3BC;l/well 4% PFA \\(4% sucrose) for 12 min on ice\n  5. wash 2x with cold PBS\n  6. remove PBS and add 200&#x3BC;l/well cold NH4Cl for 10 min on ice\n  7. wash 2x with cold PBS\n  8. wash 1x with RT PBS for 5 min\n  9. wash with H<sub>2</sub>O",
    "10.  drop of H<sub>2</sub>O and mount CVS using Gel/Mount anti-fading medium \\(Biomeda) onto a glass slide\n  11. Take pictures using an epifluorescence microscope \n  12. Analyze changes in spine length and spine head size using MetaMorph software"
