    "NOTE: The protocol described here, follows the animal care guidelines of the Illinois Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Specimen Procurement\nCollect freshly harvested bovine femurs from a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)-certified slaughterhouse and transport them in plastic air tight bags in a cooler.\n\tNOTE: For the study conducted here, femurs were collected from animals that were 24 - 30 months old, corn-fed, and weighed about 1,000 - 1,100 pounds.\nFreeze the femurs at -20 °C until the start of the specimen preparation procedure. This temperature keeps the femurs fresh12,13,14.\n2. Cutting, Cleaning, and Embedding the Specimens\nThaw the frozen femurs in a container with water for about 2 h at room temperature.\nCut multiple discs about 10 - 15 mm thick from the mid-diaphysis region using a table top diamond band saw to produce specimens with uniform cross-sectional area of the cortical bone.\nUse a dissection kit to remove any soft tissue or flesh attached to the cortical bone.\nCut the cross sections of the femurs obtained in step 2.2 using a diamond-wafering blade on a low speed saw under wet conditions along the longitudinal axis of the bone to obtain multiple roughly cuboidal sections.\n\tNOTE: Here, only specimen preparation and scratch tests performed on the short – longitudinal specimens are discussed. However, except for the direction of cutting, the preparation procedure remains the same for the transverse orientation.\nClean the specimens in a solution prepared using 1.5% anionic cleaner and 5% bleach for a duration of 20 min in an ultrasonic cleaner.\nEmbed the cortical bone specimens in acrylic resin (herein polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)) for ease of handling and stability.",
    "To embed the specimens, first coat the walls of the mold with a release agent. Then mix the acrylic resin and hardener in a beaker, as per instructions given by the PMMA manufacturer.\nPlace one of the cut cortical bone specimens into each mold with the surface to be scratched facing downwards. Pour the acrylic resin mix into these prepared specimen holders. Let the specimens cure for a duration of up to 4 - 5 h.\nCut the embedded specimens into 5-mm thick discs, exposing the surface to be scratched, using the low speed saw and mount the specimens on to metal (aluminum) discs of diameter 34 mm and height 5 mm using cyanoacrylate adhesive.\nWrap the specimens in a gauge soaked in Hanks Balanced Saline Solution (HBSS) and refrigerate at 4 °C until further use15,16.\n3. Grinding and Polishing Protocols\nNOTE: A pre-requisite to high-precision testing at small-length scales is a smooth and levelled surface of specimens. Previous polishing protocols13,17 result in a large surface roughness, leading to substantial inaccuracy in measurement. The challenge lies in achieving low average surface roughness, less than 100 nm, over a large area 3 x 8 mm2 surface.\nGrind the bovine cortical bone specimens at room temperature using 400 grit and 600 grit Silicon Carbide papers for 1 min and 5 min, respectively. Maintain the grinder-polisher at base speeds of 100 rpm and 150 rpm, respectively.\nMachine grind the bovine cortical bone specimens at room temperature on the 800 and 1,200 grit papers for a duration of 15 min for each step. Maintain the grinder-polisher at a base speed of 150 rpm, head speed of 60 rpm, and operating load of 1 lb.",
    "Polish the specimens using 3 µm, 1 µm, and 0.25 µm diamond suspension solutions in the same order on a hard, perforated, non-woven cloth for a duration of 90 min each at room temperature. Maintain the operating load for each step at 1 lb with the base and head speeds of the polisher at 300 rpm and 60 rpm, respectively.\nPolish the specimen using 0.05 µm alumina suspension solution on a soft, synthetic rayon cloth for a duration of 90 min at 1 lb with base and head speed of 100 rpm and 60 rpm, respectively, also at room temperature.\nPut the specimens in a beaker with de-ionized water and put the beaker in an ultrasonic bath for 2 min in between each consecutive step of grinding and polishing to clean the residue and avoid cross contamination.\nView the surface features using optical microscopy and SEM imaging.\n\tNOTE: As shown in Figure 1, osteons, Haversian canals, cement lines, interstitial regions, and lacunae were observed on the bovine cortical bone specimens. These imaging methods reveal the porous, heterogeneous, and anisotropic nature of cortical bone specimens. Additionally, advanced surface examination of the specimens was performed to assess the quality of the polished surface. A representative polished surface is shown in Figure 2.\n4. Micro Scratch Test\nNOTE: Micro scratch tests are performed on the polished bovine cortical bone specimens using a micro scratch tester (Figure 3). A diamond Rockwell indenter with a tip radius of 200 µm and apex angle of 120° is used for the study. The instrument allows the application of a linear progressive load up to 30 N. Furthermore, the instrument is equipped with high-accuracy sensors to measure the horizontal load, penetration depth, and acoustic emissions generated due to scratching. The instrument can capture the panoramas of scratch grooves.",
    "Prior to the testing of cortical bone specimens, calibrate the Rockwell indenter tip using polycarbonate as reference material3.\nPlace the cortical bone specimen on the stage and choose the site of scratch test using the optical microscope set up integrated to the micro scratch tester module.\nApply a linear progressive load with a start load of 30 mN and end load of 30 N. The loading rate should be set to 60 N/min and the scratch length to 3 mm.\nPerform series of scratch tests on the short longitudinal (Figure 3b) bovine cortical bone specimens as illustrated in Figure 3.\nWet the specimen surface with HBSS after a set of every three to four scratch tests to keep them hydrated.\nAnalyze the scratch test data based on non-linear fracture mechanics modelling2.\nSubscription Required.
