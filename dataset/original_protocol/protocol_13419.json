    "The protocol follows the guidelines of the Buenos Aires British Hospital's human research ethics committee.\n1. Patient evaluation\nClinical evaluation\n\t\nEvaluate patients clinically to rule out symptoms propagating from other anatomical regions or other associated pathology in the shoulder that may be the source of symptoms.\nInclude shoulder inspection and palpation, evaluate the active and passive range of motion, and perform pain provocative maneuvers and integrity tests. In addition, evaluate the cervical spine and the elbow joint.\nRadiological evaluation\n\t\nUse radiographic anteroposterior (AP) projections, a lateral scapular view, and an axillary view of the shoulder.\nClassify the calcifications by their evolutionary stage according to Gärtner6. Request an MRI to rule out any associated pathology in the shoulder.\nInclusion criteria\n\t\nInclude patients classified as having Gärtner type I and II calcifications who have undergone at least 3 months of previous conservative treatment without result.\nNever inject corticosteroids into the subacromial space when treating rotator cuff tendinopathy, as they have a deleterious effect on the elastic fibers of the tendons40,41.\nExclusion criteria: Do not include patients with Gärtner type III calcifications or other associated pathology in the affected shoulder.\n2. Application technique\nPatient positioning: Position the patient comfortably and in a way that allows exposure to the area to be treated.\n\t\nSupraspinatus or infraspinatus tendon location: Treat by placing the patient in the supine or sitting position.\nSubscapularis: Treat by placing the patient in the supine position.\nTeres minor: Treat by placing the patient in the sitting, lateral decubitus, or oblique decubitus position for better access to the posterior aspect of the shoulder.\nCoupling pads\n\tNOTE: Three pad sizes are available, each determining a specific depth of treatment focus (Figure 1).",
    "Select a coupling pad size depending on the required penetration depth of the focused point (Table 1). The selection of the coupling pad varies in shoulder calcification cases according to patient's build and location. The most frequently used sizes are large and medium.\nLocation of the area to be treated: Locate the area to be treated, considering anatomical landmarks and, if necessary, with the help of ultrasound images (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: It is very important to locate the exact area of the calcification and to focus the treatment on it4,42. The use of anatomical references and the help of ultrasound localization allows identifying the correct location. The need for a diagnostic ultrasound to locate the area is disputed, as there are studies that have not found significant differences with its use43. The application of focused waves is risky if done on large vessels and nerves or in areas close to the pleura44. Anatomical approaches that avoid these structures should be used.\nOperator positioning: The use of this type of device implies the support of an applicator by the operator. Work in an ergonomic position.\n\tNOTE: The operator must always be aware of the condition of the patient, as exceptional cases of fainting during treatment have been reported44.\nAnesthesia: Do not use anesthesia. The use of local anesthesia is contraindicated because the presence of fluids alters the acoustic impedance of the tissue. In general, tolerance to treatment with this type of device is good, even when working with high energy levels.\nContact gel: Apply adequate contact gel to the skin in the area to be treated.",
    "Navigation controls: Turn on the computer and access the touch screen. Select the Manual option at the top of the screen. The controls of the various treatment parameters are displayed. Use the rotary selection knob to set the parameters, including the intensity, frequency, and number of shocks.\nIntensity: Set the initial intensity of the treatment. The energy flux density (EFD) is graduated in the device used in millijoules per square millimeter of tissue (mJ/mm2).\n\t\nIncrease the intensity progressively as tolerated by the patient. Start with low intensity. Reach at least an energy level above 0.40 mJ/mm2 to obtain reproducible results19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26. The mean maximum intensity used is 0.50 mJ/mm2.\nFrequency: Select the frequency to be used. The equipment has a frequency between 1-25 Hz. Use 4-6 Hz.\nNumber of shocks: Select the number of shocks to be applied using the rotary selection knob. Apply at least 4,000 shocks per session.\nModification of parameters during treatment: Modify the frequency and especially the intensity during the application. Use the display located on the applicator head to easily modify the application parameters during the treatment without having to interrupt it.\nThe interval between sessions: Carry out three sessions at weekly intervals.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64426/64426fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Applicator and coupling pad variations. Three different sizes of coupling pads are available. Each one allows the focus to be taken to a different depth in the tissues.

Post-treatment protocol",
    "After the first session, alert the patients that in approximately 5% of cases, they may suffer an acute resorption process with intense pain. If discomfort occurs, recommend the patient to apply ice to the areas of pain in short sessions of no more than 10 min.\n\tNOTE: Paracetamol is preferred over non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Shock waves modulate the inflammatory process, and it is better not to alter it by other means while the treatment lasts.\nImmobilization: It is not necessary to immobilize the treated limb. Advise the patient to avoid extreme efforts and range of motions that may cause pain.\nRehabilitation program\n\t\nAs the sessions progress, if tolerance is good, increase the range of movement and incorporate exercises to strengthen the depressors of the humeral head.\nIf symptomatic relapses do not occur, include recovery exercises for the extreme ranges of movement. The strengthening of the three portions of the deltoid and the scapular stabilizers are also indicated.\nRadiological follow-up:\n\t\nPerform the first radiographic examination at 6 weeks after the sessions and the second one at 12 weeks. In the case of observing a partial resorption process that has not been completed after 12 weeks, continue the radiological follow-up.\nIf there have been no changes, opt for a new treatment module or move on to invasive procedures.\n\t\tNOTE: In many patients, very important changes can be seen in the first control x-ray. In other cases, variable changes can be seen from baseline studies, and there may be no change even on long-term radiographs in other cases.\nSubscription Required.
