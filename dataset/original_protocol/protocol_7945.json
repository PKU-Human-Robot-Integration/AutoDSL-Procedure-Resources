    "NOTE: The Program for the Protection of Human Subjects at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) and its Institutional Review Board (IRB) assures the ethical conduct of research and compliance with federal, state, and institutional regulations. In this study, all postmortem specimens used were de-identified, obtained under appropriate consent through the biorepository, and were exempt from \"human research\" designation by ISMMS's IRB (HS#14-01007). \n1. Buffer preparation\nNOTE: If performing downstream RNA sequencing, thoroughly treat all workspaces and tools with RNase Decontamination Solution to prevent mRNA degradation.\nPrepare lysis buffer.\n\t\nDissolve the following in distilled H2O up to 50 mL: 5.47 g of sucrose (0.32 M final), 250 µL of 1 M CaCl2 (5 mM final), 150 µL of 1 M Mg(CH3COO)2 (3 mM final), 10 µL of 500 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (0.1 mM final), 500 µL of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8) (10 mM final), 50 µL of Triton X-100 (0.1% final), and 17 µL of 3 M dithiothreitol (DTT, 1 mM final, add fresh) (see the Table of Materials).\nPrepare sucrose buffer\n\t\nDissolve the following in distilled H2O up to 50 mL: 30.78 g of sucrose (1.8 M final), 150 µL of 1 M Mg(CH3COO)2 (3 mM final), 500 µL of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8) (10 mM final), 17 µL of 3 M DTT (1 mM final, add fresh).\n2. Frozen tissue dissociation into single-nucleus suspension\nAdd 4 mL of ice-cold lysis buffer to a 7 mL glass tissue douncer (grinder), and keep on ice. Dissect approximately 200-400 mg of fresh-frozen human adult cortex, dounce approximately 50x, and transfer the tissue homogenate to a 12 mL ultracentrifuge polypropylene tube.",
    "Using a 5 mL pipette, add 6.5 mL of ice-cold sucrose buffer to the bottom of the ultracentrifuge tube, taking care not to disturb the layer between sucrose and the tissue homogenate.\n\t​NOTE: If processing additional samples, carefully balance the tubes by weight by adding additional lysis buffer to the lighter sample. Precise balancing of the ultracentrifuge tubes is essential to prevent damage to the rotor and ensure rotation at the proper speed.\n3. Ultracentrifugation\nUltracentrifuge the lysate at 24,400 rpm (101,814 × g) for 1 h at 4 °C. Carefully aspirate the supernatant and debris without disturbing the pellet.\n\tNOTE: A pellet may not be visible if starting with less than 200 mg of tissue.\nAdd 600 µL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Ca2+, Mg2+ free) to the nuclei pellet and incubate on ice for 10 min before resuspending.\nPipette up and down 50 times to resuspend the nuclei pellet on ice.\nUse a hemocytometer to visualize the intact nuclei under a microscope and to ensure the concentration of the resuspension is above 105 nuclei/mL before proceeding to the next step (combine 10 µL of the resuspended nuclei with 10 µL of trypan blue).\n4. Antibody incubation\nTo immunotag the sample for FANS, add 500 µL of the resuspended sample pellet, 490 µL of 1x PBS (Ca2+, Mg2+ free), 10 µL of 10% BSA (0.1% final), 1 µL of mouse anti-NeuN antibody conjugated to AF555 (NeuN-AF555, 1:1000 final concentration), and 1 µL of mouse anti-PAX6 antibody conjugated to allophycocyanin (PAX6-APC, 1:1000 final concentration).\n\tNOTE: Alternative antibodies conjugated to other fluorophores may be added (see discussion). Here, mouse anti-OLIG2 conjugated to AF488 (1:1000 concentration) was used with favorable results.\nPerform 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-only and single-color controls to set up gating parameters, using a small amount of the sample as necessary.",
    "To perform AF555 single color control, add 20 µL of the resuspended sample pellet, 970 µL of 1x PBS (Ca2+, Mg2+ free), 10 µL of 10% BSA (0.1% final), and 1 µL of NeuN-AF555 antibody (1:1000 concentration).\nTo perform APC single color control, add 20 µL of the resuspended sample pellet, 970 µL of 1X PBS (Ca2+, Mg2+ free), 10 µL of 10% BSA (0.1% final), and 1 µL of PAX6-APC antibody (1:1000 concentration).\nTo perform DAPI-only control, add 20 µL of the resuspended sample pellet, 970 µL of 1X PBS (Ca2+, Mg2+ free), and 10 µL of 10% BSA (0.1% final) (DAPI will be added later, see 4.4).\n\t\tNOTE: If more than two antibodies are used, performing fluorescence-minus-one (FMO) control is recommended in addition to the single-color controls.\nIncubate the samples and the controls with rotation in the dark for 1 h at 4 °C.\nAdd DAPI at 1:1000 to all the samples and controls, and proceed with sorting.\n5. Fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting (FANS)\nNOTE: It is recommended to use an institutional flow cytometry facility with assistance from trained personnel unless already proficient in flow cytometry/sorting techniques.\nGate as shown below.\n\t\nFirst, and for each sample, gate by forward scatter (FSC-A) vs. side scatter (SSC-A) to include particles in the appropriate size range for nuclei, thus excluding red blood cells and debris (Figure 1A).\n\t\tNOTE: A very clean nuclei preparation can distinguish between a smaller debris cluster and a nuclei cluster.\nNext, and for each sample, gate by FSC-A vs. FSC-W (or FSC-A vs. FSC-H) and SSC-A vs. SSC-W (or SSC-A vs. SSC-H) to include only singlet nuclei (Figure 1B).",
    "Next, and for each sample, gate by DAPI to include intact nuclei singlets (DAPI-high gated population), excluding debris (DAPI-low, on left of gated population) and doublets (on right of gated population) (Figure 1C).\nSet further gating based on fluorescence controls, determined visually as distinct clusters on FACS plots.\n\t\t\nRun DAPI-only control to determine background staining of populations, in the absence of antibody (Figure 1D and Figure 2A).\nRun NeuN-AF555-only control to determine the cutoff for NeuN+ staining in the channel for AF555 (Figure 2B).\nRun PAX6-APC-only control to determine the cutoff for PAX6+ staining in the APC channel (Figure 2C).\nRun additional single-color controls if using more antibodies (Figure 2D,E).\n\t\t\tNOTE: If using more than two antibodies, an FMO control is recommended to visualize any shifts in populations.\nOnce all controls have been run, draw the gates for NeuN+ and PAX6+ collections above the established thresholds.\n\t\t\nGate the NeuN+ population to collect neurons (Figure 1E and Figure 2F).\nGate the PAX6+ population from the NeuN- population to collect astrocytes (Figure 1E,F and Figure 2F).\nGate and collect additional glial populations (such as oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, as shown here by OLIG2+) from the NeuN-PAX6- population (Figure 1F).\n\t\t\tNOTE: In case determining appropriate gating cutoffs is difficult with the flow cytometry software due to indistinct populations, it may be helpful to modify the number of events being visualized (either increasing or reducing the number of events on the FANS plot).\nCollect samples appropriately based on the intended downstream analysis.\n6. Collection of FANS populations for downstream molecular analyses\nFor bulk RNA sequencing, collect 50,000-500,000 nuclei in PBS (see also section 7.1).\n\t\nAdd 2 mL of sucrose solution, 50 µL of 1 M CaCl2, and 30 µL of 1 M Mg(CH3COO)2, and fill with PBS up to 10 mL.",
    "Invert and incubate on ice for 15 min, then centrifuge at 900 × g for 10-15 min at 4 °C.\nAspirate the supernatant, resuspend in 1 mL of RNA-extracting reagent, vortex, freeze on dry ice, and store at -80 °C.\nAlternatively, collect the samples directly into 200 µL of the RNA-extracting reagent. Add the RNA-extracting reagent up to 1 mL after sorting, maintaining a 1:1 ratio of the reagent to sorted sample. Vortex, freeze on dry ice, and store at -80 °C.\nFor bulk assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq), collect 50,000-75,000 nuclei in PBS in a microcentrifuge tube coated with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Freeze nuclei on dry ice/-80 °C or immediately use them for ATAC preparation.\nFor sn RNA-seq or ATAC-seq, collect nuclei in 0.04% BSA in PBS (see also section 7.2).\n7. Pre-library preparation tips\nBulk nuclear RNA sequencing library preparation\n\t\nAfter collecting in RNA extraction reagent, perform standard phenol/chloroform RNA extraction by adding phenol/chloroform and precipitating RNA from the upper aqueous layer with ethanol, followed by DNase digestion on tube (15 min).\nPerform RNA cleanup and concentrate in a final volume of 15 µL of water.\n\t\tNOTE: Using this method, representative recovery from 300 mg of adult cortex sample is ~300,000 NeuN+ nuclei (15-20 ng/µL total RNA after cleanup and concentration) and ~250,000 PAX6+ nuclei (10-12 ng/µL total RNA after cleanup and concentration). This representative yield can vary greatly based on sample quality, gating stringency, and RNA recovery.\nPerform quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) prior to sequencing to confirm enrichment of astrocytes based on high differential expression of canonical astrocyte markers (GFAP, SOX9), 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (ALDH1L1)) and depletion of neuronal and other cell lineage markers (Figure 1G).",
    "NOTE: Collection of the double-negative population (NeuN-PAX6-) allows for a more accurate, multitiered qPCR quality control analysis for the relative enrichment of astrocytes (Figure 2H).\nGenerate RNA-seq libraries using a kit recommended for low RNA integrity number values, as expected from postmortem samples.\nSingle-nucleus sequencing library preparation\n\t\nPerform sn sequencing through an institutional sequencing core.\nFor nanofluidics-based processing and sequencing, use the recommended concentration of 1 × 106 cells/mL in at least 60 µL of 1x PBS + 0.04% BSA for single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) and 3 × 106 cells/mL in at least 20 µL of 1x PBS + 0.04% BSA for single-nucleus Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (snATAC-seq).\nSubscription Required.
