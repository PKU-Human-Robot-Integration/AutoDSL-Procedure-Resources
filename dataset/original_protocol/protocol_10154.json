    "1. Preparation of 1 wt% 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (TEMPO)-mediated Oxidized Cellulose Nanofiber (TOCN) Sol\nNOTE: The sol is defined as a colloidal suspension of very small solid particles in a continuous liquid medium.\nSuspend 66.7 g of Nadelholz Bleached Kraft Pulp (NBKP, containing 12 g of cellulose) in 700 mL of deionized (DI) water with a mechanical agitator at 300 rpm for 20 min.\nAdd 20 mL of aqueous TEMPO solution (containing 0.15 g of TEMPO) and 20 mL of aqueous NaBr solution (containing 1.5 g of NaBr) slowly to the above NBKP suspension14,15.\nAdjust the pH of the above suspension to approximately 10.5 (measured with a pH meter) with slowly adding 3.0 M NaOH solution.\nSlowly add approximately 63.8 g of aqueous NaClO solution (with 6-14 wt% active chlorine) with a pipette to the above mixture to start TEMPO-mediated oxidation.\nWhile adding NaClO, continue adding the NaOH solution to keep the pH of the system within the range of 10.0 to ~10.5. This process takes about 2.5 h.\nRinse the TEMPO-mediated oxidized cellulose fibers with DI water 3 times (1,200 mL of DI water each time) to remove the residual NaClO, NaOH and other chemicals.\nTreat the paste with a powerful mechanical blender to disintegrate the oxidized cellulose fibers into nanofibers. Carry out the mechanical treatment carefully several times accompanied with an addition of equal amount of water. Finally, a 1 wt% TEMPO-mediated oxidized cellulose nanofiber (TOCN) sol is obtained. The TOCNs have a diameter of 4 to ~6 nm, and a length of 0.5 to ~2 μm.\nStore the 1 wt% TOCN sol at 4 °C (cellulose nanofibers tend to rot at an ambient temperature).\n2. Preparation of TOCN-styrene Butadiene Rubber (SBR) Mixed Sol",
    "Add 0.21 g of SBR colloid (48.5 wt%) into 10 g of 1 wt% TOCN sol (step 11.7.) in a 20 mL glass vessel.\nAgitate the above mixture for 3 min with a vortex mixer at the power level of 6 to achieve an evenly dispersed sol. Store the above mixture sol at 4 °C before use.\n3. Preparation of TOCN-TiO2 Mixed Sol\nAdd 0.1 g of TiO2 nanoparticles (with an average particle size of 20 nm) into 10 g of 1 wt% TOCN sol in a 20 mL glass vessel.\nAgitate the above mixture with a homogenizer for 10 min to achieve an evenly mixed sol. Perform this 10 min-process intermittently, since a significant amount of heat is generated in the process and results in the rise of temperature, which may degrade TOCNs. Store the mixture sol at 4 °C before use.\n4. Preparation of TOCN-surface Oxidized Carbon Fiber (SOCF) Mixed Sols\nReflux 1.7 g of carbon fiber (300 mesh, with a diameter of 5.5 to ~6.0 μm and a length of approximately 50 μm) in 150 mL of concentrated nitric acid at 60 °C for 6 h to achieve SOCF16. Add 0.01 g of the above SOCF into 10 g of 1 wt% TOCN sol inside a 20 mL glass vessel.\nShake-mix the above mixture, and ultra-sonicate the mixture for 5 min to achieve an evenly mixed sol. Store the mixture sol at 4 °C before use.\n5. Preparation of Microhoneycomb Monolith from the 1 wt% TOCN Sol (Denoted MHM-TOCN)\nLoad a polypropylene (PP) tube (with an inner diameter of 13 mm, an outer diameter of 15 mm, and a length of 150 mm) with glass beads and fill the bottom 5 cm part of the tube13.",
    "Load a certain amount (the amount is not controlled for each time, but it is normally larger than 2.7 mL to ensure the subsequent cutting process) of the 1 wt% TOCN sol into the above PP tube containing glass beads.\n\tNOTE: TOCN sol was directly filled into the PP tube without pouring in glass beads for the study of the distance effect that has been involved in the unidirectional freezing process. In this case, the amount of TOCN sol was 11 mL.\nCarefully remove the bubbles that may have been generated during the sol loading. Keep the PP tube containing the TOCN sol at 4 °C overnight before use.\nAttach the above PP tube containing the TOCN sol to the dipping machine that is used for unidirectional freezing. Set the relevant parameters and start dipping the PP tube into a thermo jug containing liquid nitrogen (-196 °C) at a constant speed of 50 cm h-1 (Figure 1).\nCut the PP tube part with a saw, and crack the frozen TOCN sol part into several sections. Freeze dry these sections with a freeze-drying machine at -10 °C for 1 day, then at -5 °C for 1 day, and finally at 0 °C for 1 day. The MHM-TOCN was obtained as white-colored monoliths (Figure 1).\n6. Preparation of Microhoneycomb Monolith from the TOCN-SBR Mixed Sol (Denoted MHM-TOCN/SBR) and TOCN-TiO2 Mixed Sol (Denoted MHM-TOCN/TiO2 )\nLoad polypropylene (PP) tubes (with an inner diameter of 13 mm, an outer diameter of 15 mm, and a length of 150 mm) with glass beads, filling the bottom 5 cm part of the tubes.",
    "NOTE: The glass beads are used to cover the area where unsteady ice crystal growth occurs, to achieve uniform morphology of the resulting sample. Both the size and surface property of the glass beads do not affect the morphology of the resulting sample.\nLoad certain amount (the amount is not controlled for each time, but it is normally larger than 2.7 mL to ensure the subsequent cutting process) of the TOCN-SBR mixed sol or TOCN-TiO2 mixed sol into the PP tubes containing glass beads.\nCarefully remove the bubbles that may have been generated during the sol loading. Keep the PP tubes containing the above mixed sol at 4 °C overnight before use.\nAttach the PP tubes containing the above mixed sols to the dipping machine that is used for unidirectional freezing. Set the relevant parameters and start dipping the PP tube into a tank containing liquid nitrogen (-196 °C) at a constant speed of 20 cm h-1.\nCut the PP tube part with a saw, and crack the frozen TOCN-SBR mixed sol part into several sections.\nFreeze dry these sections with a freeze-drying machine at -10 °C for 1 day, then at -5 °C for 1 day, and finally at 0 °C for 1 day. The MHM-TOCN/SBR and MHM-TOCN/TiO2 were obtained as white monoliths.\n7. Preparation of Microhoneycomb Monolith from the TOCN-SOCF Mixed Sol (Denoted MHM-TOCN/SOCF)\nLoad a polypropylene (PP) tube (with an inner diameter of 13 mm and an outer diameter of 15 mm, and a length of 150 mm) with glass beads, filling the bottom 5 cm part of the tube.",

The MHM-TOCN/SOCF was obtained as a white-grey monolith.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
