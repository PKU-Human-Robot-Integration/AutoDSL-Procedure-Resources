    "All research conducted with human participants must have human ethics approval by the appropriate institutional ethics committee and the study must be conducted in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki.\n1. Patient Screening\nScreen all patients for PREP2 suitability within 72 h of stroke onset.\n\tNOTE: Patients are suitable if they have had a unilateral ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke within the last 72 h, have new UL weakness, and are 18 years or older.\n2. SAFE Score\nNOTE: Ensure that patients with inattention or fatigue are focused on the arm to enable an accurate assessment of strength.\nPosition the patient with their back fully supported and upright either in bed or in a chair and their paretic arm by their side with the elbow in extension.\nDemonstrate shoulder abduction. Ask the patient to lift their arm sideways and up towards their ear. Use the Medical Research Council (MRC) grades to score shoulder abduction strength.\n\tNOTE: MRC grades are described as follows: 0 = no palpable muscle activity; 1 = palpable muscle activity but no movement; 2 = limited range of movement without gravity; 3 = full range of motion against gravity but no resistance; 4 = full range of motion against gravity and resistance but weaker than the other side; 5 = normal power.\nTo score shoulder abduction grades 4 or 5, place your hand over the patient's arm, proximal to the elbow and apply resistance.\n\tNOTE: The patient must be able to achieve full range of motion against resistance to be awarded a score of 4 or higher.\nPlace the paretic forearm in pronation with the fingers fully flexed and provide support under the wrist.\nDemonstrate finger extension. Ask the patient to straighten their fingers and use the Medical Research Council grades to score finger extension strength.",
    "To score finger extension grades 4 or 5, apply resistance over the dorsum of the fingers, distal to the metacarpophalangeal joints, throughout the movement.\n\tNOTE: The patient must be able to achieve full extension against resistance to be awarded a score of 4 or higher.\nTo score fingers with unequal strength, use the majority rule. If three fingers have the same score, use this score. If two fingers have a lower score than the other two fingers, use the lower score.\nAdd the MRC grades for shoulder abduction and finger extension together for a SAFE score out of 10. If the patient has a SAFE score of 5 or more on day 3 poststroke they can be assumed to have a functional corticospinal tract and TMS is not required. If the patient has a SAFE score less than 5 on day 3 poststroke, TMS is required to determine their MEP status.\n3. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)\nEvaluate patient suitability for TMS.\n\t\nComplete a TMS safety checklist with the patient to identify absolute and relative contraindications to TMS24.\n\t\tNOTE: This information should be gathered through patient and family interview and from the medical records. See representative results section for more detail.\nAsk the patient's physician to review the TMS checklist and approve it if appropriate.\nOn the day of the TMS test, review the patient's medical status with the clinical team and the patient to ensure there have been no changes since the checklist was signed.\n\t\tNOTE: Events to consider include fall with head injury, seizure, if the patient has become medically unwell, is hypoglycemic, or has unstable blood pressure. Ensure the patient has taken all prescribed medication prior to the test.\nPrepare the environment.",
    "Remove furniture from around the bed. Move the bed away from the wall to allow space for the TMS unit.\nPlace the TMS unit at the head of the bed towards the side opposite the paretic limb. Angle the TMS unit so that the person delivering TMS can easily see the screen.\nTest the TMS setup to check it is working appropriately.\n\t\tNOTE: This protocol uses a single-pulse TMS unit. The electromyography (EMG) signal can be sampled at 2 kHz and filtered with 10 Hz high-pass and 1,000 Hz low-pass filters. The EMG equipment needs to be triggered by the TMS unit such that the EMG trace begins at least 50 ms prior to the TMS stimulus and ends at least 50 ms after the TMS stimulus.\nEnsure familiarity with the protocol for summoning emergency assistance in the TMS assessment room in case this is required.\nPrepare the patient.\n\tNOTE: Patients with intravenous (IV) lines, nasogastric feeding, or low concentrations of supplementary oxygen via a nasal cannula can be tested with TMS provided that they are considered medically stable by the treating physician. Supplemental oxygen should continue throughout the TMS session. Suspending and disconnecting nasogastric feeding and non-essential fluids through IV lines will make it easier to conduct the TMS assessment.\n\t\nRemove any clothing covering the forearms. Remove any items covering the paretic wrist such as a watch or identification bracelet to enable the EMG electrode placement.\nPosition the paretic arm on a pillow with the forearm pronated and fully supported from the elbow to the hand.\nPalpate the paretic forearm to locate the muscle belly for the extensor carpi radialis (ECR) muscle. Identify positions for two surface EMG electrodes over the muscle belly, allowing for factors such as the position of IV cannula or dressings.",
    "NOTE: It is essential that at least one electrode is positioned over the muscle belly. This may require discussion with the nursing staff about repositioning dressings before the test if possible.\nClean the skin at each electrode site with an alcohol skin-cleansing wipe. Shave each electrode site to remove any hair. Lightly abrade the electrode sites with an abrasive cream or tape. Take care with patients who have fragile skin and avoid any areas of broken skin.\nSecurely apply self-adhesive disposable recording electrodes to each site.\nLocate the electrode sites for the first dorsal interosseus muscle (FDI). One electrode will be placed on the FDI muscle belly and one on the dorsum of the hand.\n\t\tNOTE: Electrode placement may vary depending on patient factors such as the position of an IV cannula or dressings.\nPrepare the skin and apply the self-adhesive recording electrodes as previously described.\nPlace the reference electrode strap around the arm just proximal to the elbow. Alternatively, prepare the skin and place a self-adhesive reference electrode over the lateral epicondyle of the humerus.\nPosition the patient in bed for the test.\n\t\nLower the bed rails. Move the patient as high up the bed as possible and towards the edge of the bed on the non-paretic side.\n\t\tNOTE: The patient should only be moved by trained staff.\nPut the bed rail back up on the paretic side for safety. Remove the headboard of the bed if possible and remove any unused IV poles attached to the bed that may obstruct the coil position.",
    "Raise the head of the bed as high as possible. Position pillows behind the patient's back to bring them into an upright sitting position without their head contacting the bed. Do not put a pillow behind the head. If possible, raise the knees to prevent the patient from slipping down the bed during testing.\nEnsure the paretic forearm is in pronation and fully supported by a pillow from the elbow to the wrist. Check for adequate TMS coil access by holding the TMS coil against the patient's head. Make adjustments to the patient's position as required.\nPosition the patient in a chair or wheelchair for the test (alternative option).\n\t\nEnsure the patient is sitting upright and comfortably in the chair. Place a pillow under each arm. Ensure the paretic forearm is pronated and fully supported by the pillow.\nCheck the EMG trace: Connect the cables between the patient and the EMG unit. Check to make sure the EMG signal is free from any electrical noise.\nDeliver TMS.\n\t\nTwo trained staff should be present for the TMS test. Instruct the patient to look straight ahead, keeping their head still and eyes open.\nThe person holding the coil should stand next to the patient's head on their non-paretic side and position the center of the coil over the location of the primary motor cortex of the stroke-affected hemisphere. This is approximately 4 cm lateral from the vertex on the interaural line.\n\t\tNOTE: Another way to identify the starting coil position is to measure approximately a third of the distance from the vertex to the front of the ear.\nOrient the coil with the handle pointing backwards, at an approximately 45° angle in the midsagittal plane to produce a posterior-to-anterior current in the underlying tissue.",
    "NOTE: The coil used in this protocol is a flat figure-eight coil, but a branding coil or circular coil can also be used.\nAdjust the bed height for the coil holder's comfort. Use a step if necessary. The second person (not the coil holder) is responsible for monitoring patient comfort throughout the TMS session. They may stand at the foot of the bed to monitor the patient and ensure the patient maintains a neutral head position or monitor the patient from the bedside while adjusting the TMS unit controls as necessary.\n\t\tNOTE: This will depend on the individual TMS setup used. The patient should be monitored for comfort levels, alertness, and any adverse effects such as vasovagal responses to the TMS.\nBegin with a stimulus intensity of 30% maximum stimulator output (MSO). Increase intensity in 10% MSO steps with three to five stimuli at each intensity and scalp location.\nMove the coil systematically in 1 cm steps in each direction (anterior, posterior, medial, lateral) to find the optimal location for producing MEPs in the recorded muscles. Small adjustments to the coil rotation may also be necessary.\nContinue increasing the stimulus intensity and moving the coil until the MEPs are consistently observed in one or both muscles or until 100% MSO is reached.\nIf 100% MSO is reached with no MEPs observed, use active facilitation to increase corticomotor excitability and the likelihood of eliciting a MEP. Ask the patient to hug a pillow to their chest with both arms, attempting to activate their paretic UL as much as possible. For patients with no distal UL activity, ask them to elevate and retract at the shoulder girdle.\nClassify the MEP status of the patient.",
    "Classify the patient as MEP+ if MEPs of any amplitude are observed with a consistent latency in response to at least five stimuli. This can be either at rest or during voluntary facilitation. FDI latencies are typically 20–30 ms while ECR latencies are typically 15–25 ms. MEPs do not have to exceed a peak-to-peak amplitude of 50 µV.\nClassify the patient as MEP- if a MEP cannot be elicited at 100% MSO either at rest or while attempting voluntary facilitation.\nRemove electrodes and wipe the skin with an alcohol wipe. The skin may be slightly red but this usually resolves without any treatment.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
