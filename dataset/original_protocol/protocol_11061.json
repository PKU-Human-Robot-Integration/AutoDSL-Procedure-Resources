    "The present study was conducted with prior approval from and following the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Ethical Committee, Institute of Life Sciences, Bhubaneswar. All zebrafish maintenance and breeding were conducted at an ambient fish culture facility at 28.5 °C, and the embryos were maintained in a biological oxygen demand (BOD) incubator at a temperature of 28.5 °C. Here, the zebrafish AB strain was used, and the staging was carried out according to Kimmel et al.54. X-ray radiation was given at 6 hpf (shield stage), and different phenotypes were observed until 120 hpf.\n1. Breeding setup and embryo collection\nSet the breeding tanks (made up of polycarbonate, capacity 1 L, see Table of Materials). Pour system water (pH, 6.8-7.5; conductivity, 500 µS; and temperature, 28.5 °C) into the breeding tanks covering nearly 40% of its volume. Place the divider in the tank to create two chambers, one for females and the other for males.\nFrom the parent tanks, carefully collect two healthy females and one healthy male with the help of a net, put them in their respective halves, and keep them in the dark overnight (minimum 10 h) at 28.5 °C.\nThe next morning, remove the divider and allow the fishes to mate without disturbing the breeding tanks.\n\tNOTE: The females will start spawning, and the eggs will be seen lying on the bottom of the tank within 10-15 min after the fishes are allowed to mate56,57,58.\nReturn the fishes to their tanks after spawning, collect the embryos from the breeding tank using a strainer, wash them properly with the system water, and keep the collected eggs in a Petri plate with E-3 media (4.94 mM of NaCl, 0.17 mM of KCl, 0.43 mM CaCl2, 0.85 mM of MgCl2 salts, 1% w/v of methylene blue, see Table of Materials).",
    "Observe the eggs under a dissecting microscope, remove the unfertilized or dead embryos using a Pasteur pipette, and keep the Petri plates containing fertilized eggs in the E-3 medium at 28.5 °C in an incubator for their proper growth and maintenance.\n\tNOTE: Unfertilized eggs can be identified with a milky white appearance with a coagulated chorion or with ruptured cells inside the chorion. Along with unfertilized eggs, eggs not undergoing cleavage and eggs with deformities like irregularities during cleavage, e.g., asymmetry, vesicle formation, or injuries of the chorion, or not actively developing, must be discarded to keep the collected embryos healthy and to keep the media clean7,56.\n2. Monitoring embryos and selection for radiation experiments\nMonitor the growing embryos under the dissecting microscope, identify the proper stage7,54, and remove any dead or unhealthy embryos. Ensure adequate embryo staging as the radiation and drug doses will be given at a particular gastrulation stage.\n\tNOTE: Every day, check for the level and quality of media in the culture dishes. Change the media every 24 h, along with removing dead embryos. Pasteur pipettes are preferred to be used for picking embryos or changing media.\nBefore starting the experiment, carefully distribute the healthy embryos in the experimental plates with the help of a Pasteur pipette. For each experimental group, take 15-20 embryos.\n\t​NOTE: Place only healthy embryos of the desired developmental stages in the experimental plate. Suppose the drug treatment has to be done with embryos at 6 hpf, then start seeding them in experimental plates at least 30-60 min earlier.\n3. Drug treatment\nAdd drugs of desired concentration to the zebrafish embryos. Prepare the drug-containing E-3 media well in advance. Ensure the stock solution of the drug has no undissolved drug before preparing the working media for treating zebrafish embryos.",
    "Before adding any drug to a medium for radiation screening, check the cytotoxic effect of the drug with the grades of concentrations of the drug. Follow the OECD guidelines to evaluate the LC 50 of the drugs under evaluation59,60,61.\n\t​NOTE: Be careful while moving the plates and dishes during the irradiation or observation time. There are many chances that the plates will be disturbed during this handling, causing the media to leak out of the wells or the embryos to spill out of their respective wells, potentially contaminating nearby wells and ruining the experiment.\n4. X-ray irradiation\nWhile setting up a radiation experiment, include a control/non-irradiated and a radiation-only group. Similarly, while performing a drug screening, include another group where the drugs will be given with the same concentration as those administered in the screening experiment along with radiation.\n\tNOTE: Label both the lid and base of well plates or culture dishes so that the lids do not get misplaced.\nDistribute the embryos in a well plate if the radiation shields can cover and protect the extra wells from radiation while the other wells are exposed to a particular radiation dose; otherwise, use individual plates or discs to seed the embryos per radiation dose.\nTurn on the X-ray irradiator machine (see Table of Materials), and initiate the machine initialization and warm-up.\n\tNOTE: The source to subject distance (SSD) value must be 50 cm; one can use different SSDs yet again, which requires standardization.\nPlace the experimental plate under the irradiator inside the machine in the center, ensuring that the plate is directly below the X-ray source, and then set the dose (e.g., 5 GY) and start the X-ray.",
    "NOTE: Seal the plates with paraffin film to avoid any unwanted spillage or contamination during the transportation of the plates from the incubator to the irradiator and back.\nAfter the completion of irradiation, take out the plates, shut down the machine program, switch off the machine, and check the plates under the microscope immediately after radiation. Remove the dead embryos and return the plates to the incubator at 28.5 °C. Record the number of dead embryos after evaluating them under the dissecting microscope.\n\tNOTE: Irradiate the different groups of embryos with designated radiation doses without much delay between individual groups as the effect of radiation may be significantly affected by the difference in the developmental stage.\n\t​CAUTION: While operating the X-ray machine, take proper protective measures.\n5. Data collection, imaging, and analysis\nCollect data at predetermined time intervals, such as every 24 h after the radiation is given. Record all possible observations such as survival, hatching efficiency, stage of development, heartbeat count, body and tail curvature, pericardial edema, the extension of the yolk sac, microcephaly, swim bladder development, general motility or activity, etc.62,63,64.\nTo capture images, choose representative embryos on a clean slide, check the embryos under the microscope, orient them in a particular direction, and click on images. Rename the image files according to the group and time.\n\tNOTE: The same magnification and illumination must be used while capturing pictures at different time intervals.\nSubscription Required.
