    "Cell preparation and cell cultureDilute 500 ml blood with 500 ml HBSS, carefully layer 35 ml of diluted blood over 15 ml of Ficoll in a 50 ml conical tube.Centrifuge at 350 x g for 40 min at 25 °C in a swinging-bucket rotor without brake. Aspirate the upper layer leaving the mononuclear cell layer undisturbed.Carefully transfer the mononuclear cell layer to a new 50 ml conical tube. Fill the tube with HBSS, mix, and centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min at 25 °C. Carefully remove supernatant. Resuspend the cell pellet in 50 ml HBSS and centrifuge at 200 x g for 15 min at 25 °C. Carefully remove supernatant. Resuspend cell pellet in 10 ml PBS containing 2 mM EDTA and 0.5% BSA. Determine cell number. Centrifuge cell suspension at 300 x g for 10 min at 25 °C. Aspirate supernatant completely. Resuspend cell pellet in 80 µl of PBS containing 2 mM EDTA and 0.5% BSA per 107 cells, add 20 µl of CD4 microbeads per 107 cells. Mix and incubate for 15 min in the refrigerator at 4 °C. Wash cells by adding 2 ml of PBS containing 2 mM EDTA and 0.5% BSA per 107 cells and centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min at 25 °C. Remove the supernatant and resuspend up to 108 cells in 500 µl of PBS containing 2 mM EDTA and 0.5% BSA. Then do the magnetic separation according to the CD4 microbeads data sheet to enrich the CD4+ T cells, and save the flow through CD4- fraction of the mononuclear cells as primary antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which is contaminated with very low percentage of CD8+ T cells but not affecting the following stimulation.",
    "Culture the CD4+ T cells or Jurkat T cells, primary APCs or Raji B cells, in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution.Cell stimulationSuperantigen (SEE) stimulationIncubate primary APCs (1 x 107) or Raji B cells (1 x 107) with or without 500 ng/ml (primary APCs) or 100 ng/ml (Raji B) SEE in 200 μl final volume of RPMI-1640 medium (10% FBS) in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube for 30 min at 37 °C. Then centrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 3 min at 25 °C and wash the pellet with ice cold PBS to obtain SEE-loaded APC-SEE or Raji B-SEE cells. Wash primary CD4+ or Jurkat T cells (1 x 107) with 1 ml ice cold PBS once and resuspend in 200 μl final volume of RPMI-1640 medium, and incubate on ice for 15 min.Mix APC-SEE or Raji-B-SEE with T cells at a 1 to 1 ratio (in 400 µl final volume), spin down at 4 °C, 300 x g, 1 min. Keep the cell pellet in the medium and immediately incubate the cell pellet for 1, 5, 15, 30 min at 37 °C.Antibody stimulationResuspend Jurkat T (1 x 107) or human primary CD4+ cells (1 x 107) in 200 μl of serum free RPMI. Incubate on ice for 10 min. Then add 10 μg/ml anti-CD3 and/or 2 μg/ml anti-CD28 mAbs, place the mixture on ice for 5 min, followed by crosslinking with goat-anti-mouse IgG (10 μg/ml) and immediately incubate the cells at 37 °C for 1, 5, 15, 30 min .Centrifuge the cells at 350 x g for 3 min, carefully remove the supernatant and lyse stimulated cells in 120 μl lysis buffer (Xie et al., 2013) containing 20 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) on ice for 10 min.",
    "Clear the lysate by centrifugation (8,500 x g, 10 min, 4 °C), then add 1% SDS (v/v) to the supernatants and dissociate the immunoprecipitated proteins by heating at 90 °C for 10 min. Dilute lysate obtained in step 4 ten-folds with lysis buffer, and immunoprecipitate Flag-tagged PKC-θ or endogenous PKC-θ with anti-Flag M2 or goat-anti-PKC-θ Abs, respectively, at 4 °C overnight with rotation. Anti-IgG immunoprecipitation and IPs from lysates of unstimulated cells are done in parallel as negative controls. Then add 30 µl protein G beads (50% [v/v] in PBS) and incubate for 2-4 h at 4 °C with rotation.Centrifuge at 8,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C, remove the supernatant carefully and wash the immunoprecipitates extensively by adding 1 ml lysis buffer containing 20 mM NEM and vortexing for 3-5 min. Repeat the wash step for another 4 times. Then subject the samples to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblot with anti-SUMO1 (1:1,000) or mouse-anti-PKC-θ (1:1,000) Abs. A representative immunoblotting is shown in the Representative data section (Figure 5)."
