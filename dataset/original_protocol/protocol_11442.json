    "All the methods described here have been approved by the Boston Children's Hospital Institutional Biosafety Committee.\n1. Cell Preparation\nThawing KHOS-A and -N cells\nWarm up culture medium, i.e., Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal calf serum (FBS) and 1% (vol/vol) penicillin/streptomycin.\nTake the cryogenic vials of cells from the liquid nitrogen tank, immerse the bottom of the vials into warm water in a 37 °C water bath, and gently shake the cryogenic vials to accelerate the thawing process. Keep the lid of cryogenic vials from contacting water in order to avoid contamination. As soon as cells are thawed, sterilize the cryogenic vial by spraying 70% ethanol solution and wiping the vial.\nIn a laminar flow hood, immediately aspirate the cell suspension from the cryogenic vial, and gently suspend in 10 mL warmed culture medium (described in 1.1.1). Centrifuge cell suspensions at approximately 200 x g for 5 - 7 min.\nResuspend the cell pellet with 10 mL warmed culture medium, and transfer into a T75 flask. Gently pipette several times to suspend cells evenly using a 10-mL pipet.\nPlace the flask into a 37 °C incubator with 5% (vol/vol) CO2 and humidified atmosphere. Allow cells to attach for at least 12 h.\nIncubate cells for approximately 3 - 7 days until 80 - 100% confluent. Change the culture medium every 2 - 3 days.\nSplitting KHOS-A and -N cells\nRemove the culture media from the flask.\nWash the cells with 5 mL sterile PBS (1x) without calcium and magnesium, to remove non adherent cells or fraction.\nAdd 1 mL 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA solution into the flask, and briefly swirl the flask to ensure that the trypsin-EDTA is dispersed evenly.",
    "Incubate the flask for 2 - 3 min in a 37 °C incubator or 3 - 5 min at room temperature. Check the cells under a microscope at approximately 400x magnification to make sure that the cells are rounded up and detached.\nOnce the cells are detached, add 10 mL culture medium and gently pipette the medium up and down several times to break up cell aggregates into a single cell suspension using a 10 mL pipet.\nCount cells using a cell counter. Seed the cell suspension into new T75 flasks at a density of 2 × 106 cells or a ratio of 1:4.\nAllow cells to grow to 80 - 100% confluence before seeding for the QPI experiment.\nSeeding KHOS-A and -N cells for QPI\nSeed KHOS-A and -N cells in 6-well plates at the density of 50,000 - 300,000 cells/well with 5 mL culture medium after counting with a cell counter.\n\t\tNOTE: The seeding density is dependent on the cell proliferation rate, and the imaging time period in order to have <100% confluence during imaging acquisition.\nIncubate cells for at least 12 h to allow attachment.\nChange the medium with fresh media before conducting QPI.\n2. QPI Acquisition\nCover slip set up\nClean the cover slip by rinsing several times with running deionized water and sterilize with 75% ethanol solution by immersion for 15 min. Put the cover slip into a sterile laminar flow hood to dry.\nCarefully place the cover slip onto a 6-well plate to avoid obvious bubbles. Ensure that the bottom of the cover slip is immersed in the culture media (minimum 5 mL/well).",
    "Place the plate into the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, and humidified atmosphere) to equilibrate for at least 15 min. If fog forms on the cover slip, use a sterile cotton swab to wipe it clean.\nImaging cells with a microscope\nOpen the software to initialize the system, including self calibration of exposure time, pattern contrast, and hologram noise. Make sure the values are acceptable (shown in green or yellow range).\nPlace the 6-well plate onto the stage of the QPI microscope.\nClick \"Live Capture,\" and select \"Manual\" in \"Software focus.\" Coarsely focus the phase images of cells by adjusting the work distance in \"Microscope setting\" to obtain outlines for cells in phase images. Change to \"Automatic\" in \"Software focus.\"\nClick \"New experiment\" to create a new experiment. Start with the selection of image acquisition positions using the mouse or the arrow keys on the numerical pad. Click \"Remember\" after each selection. Normally 3 - 5 locations for each sample are selected.\nSet up the imaging intervals and time period in the \"Timelapse\" section.\n\t\tNOTE: To track cancer cells clearly, the intervals should be shorter than 5 min. 48 hours is set as the time period for the combination QPI analysis.\nStart the experiment by clicking \"Capture,\" which will automatically focus and acquire the images at the setting time points.\n3. Data Analysis\nCell morphology analysis\nClick \"Identify cells.\" Adjust the numeric setting for \"Background threshold\" so that cell areas are separated well from background noise. Adjust the setting number for \"Object size\" to make sure that each cell has one nucleus. Maintain consistent parameters for samples that need to be compared, as these may affect the final area and volume measurements. Manually modify cell segments by using \"Manual changes,\" if needed.",
    "Use the \"Analyze data\" function in the software to analyze cells. Start a new data analysis by clicking \"New analysis.\" Drag selected images into the \"Source frames\" tab and cell morphology parameters including cell area (µm2), optical thickness (µm), and volume (µm3) for every individual cell. Choose scatter plot or histogram mode and export data as tables or figures.\nCell proliferation analysis\nSelect at least 5 images for the different time points of interest (e.g., initial, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, and 48 h). Record cell numbers that are provided by the software.\nTo estimate the doubling time, plot cell numbers after normalizing with the initial numbers and fit with exponential growth curves.\nCell motion analysis\nUse the \"Track cells\" function in the software. Click \"New analysis\" to start a new data analysis. Drag series of images for a selected time period (e.g., 4 h after 24 h incubation) into the \"Source frames\" tab. Randomly choose 10 - 30 cells by clicking cells under the \"Add cells\" selection mode. Exclude the cells at the edges and those moving out of the field of view.\nCarefully check the tracking in the series of images. In the event that the system loses track of a cell or tracks the wrong cell, manually adjust the tracking cell by clicking \"Identify\" to identify cells or clicking \"Modify location\" under the \"Select\" mode to modify the cell location.\nChoose rose plot of cell trajectories in \"Plot movement\" or plot for the other motion-related parameters in \"Plot features,\" such as motility speed (µm/h), motility (µm), migration (µm), and migration directness. Export Data as tables or figures.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
