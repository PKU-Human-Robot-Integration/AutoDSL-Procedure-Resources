    "Note: Dissociate an extra piece of tissue that does not contain your region of interest but is from a comparable location in cortex. This will serve as a negative fluorescent control for FACS. For our experiment, we dissected out primary motor cortex from a wildtype mouse that did not receive any viral labeling.\nTissue digestion and manual dissociation\nTiming: Variable depending on age of mouse, up to 70 min\nTransfer dissected tissue to 5 mL microfuge tubes containing 3 mL enzyme solution (dissociation buffer + Papain).\nNote: This is the only solution to contain Papain.\nPlace 5 mL tubes on a tube rack and secure the rack onto an orbital shaker in an incubation oven set to 34°C.\nTo calculate incubation time, add 15 min to the animal’s age in days to a max of 70 min). E.g., postnatal day 28 incubate for 43 min, postnatal day 56 incubate for 70 min.\nRemove papain solution with a P1000 pipette, allowing the tissue chunks to remain at the bottom of the tube. Add 2 mL of Stop solution and place on ice and incubate for 5 min. Do not shake or mix the solution at this step.\nRemove stop solution with a P1000 pipette and replace with 800μL of cold dissociation buffer.\nCritical: for this step, ensure that the dissociation buffer is cold and does not contain any papain.\nTriturate sample with fire-polished pipettes (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nStart with pipette with a diameter of 600 μm. Triturate 10 times.\nTriturate 10 times with the pipette of 300 μm diameter.\nTriturate 6 times with the pipette of 150 μm diameter.\nCritical: Triturate very carefully to avoid air bubbles.\nCritical: Tips should be thoroughly flushed with water and then dissociation buffer between samples.\nPlace samples on ice until ready for FACS.",

Sample trituration, related to step 7\nPreparation of sony cell sorter for FACS\nBased on morphological analyses, pyramidal neurons have a soma diameter of 10–20 μm (Oswald et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]), while astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia have an average diameter of 6–8μms (Chai et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Karasek et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Davis et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). One of the key methods for neuronal enrichment is to set the initial size gate such that anything smaller than 10 μm is gated out.\nTiming: 30 min\nTurn on Sony cell sorter and insert a 130 μm Microfluidic sorting Chip.\nAdd a drop of 8μm–12.9 μm polystyrene particle standard beads and 13μm–17.9 μm polystyrene particle standard beads into 1× PBS.\nSort the bead solution with forward scatter area and back scatter area to establish the first gate (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1196-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Example FACS gating strategy for collecting Rbp4+ neurons from Rbp4 cre mice crossed with tdTomato reporter mice (ai14)\n1) Polystyrene beads allow for gating on known size. 2) Based on beads size, size gate of sample is set. 3) Backscatter height and width are used to remove cellular doublets or intact cells plus debris. 4) Non-fluorescent control sample is used to set fluorescence gate (tdTomato from reporter mouse). 5) Collection shows intact cells expressing tdTomato and enriched in cytoplasmic dye.\nNote: Cortical neurons have a soma size of approximately 10μm–20μm. Anything <10μm is likely debris.\nNote: This can be done while waiting for the enzymatic dissociation.\nSample preparation for FACS",
    "Incubation in cytoplasmic dye will allow for selection of intact neurons based on visualization of the cytoplasm using FACS. As this protocol dissociates long-distance projection neurons, the dissociation itself results in removal of the primary axon of the neuron. This leads to inevitable membrane disruption/ permeability which allows for uptake of the cytoplasmic dye and binding to intracellular amines primarily in neurons (as other cell-types remain intact). Our experiments culturing these dissociated neurons after FACS confirm that while they do take up the dye, they remain viable during and after dissociation.\nTiming: 15 min\nAdd cytoplasmic dye directly to the sample at a concentration of 1:1000.\nGently flick tube to mix into solution.\nNote: The cytoplasmic labeling dye used here is marketed as a live/dead stain as it is used to differentiate between cells that have an intact or disrupted plasma membrane. It doesn’t identify any cellular biochemical processes that suggest the cell is overtly dying per se. Removal of the primary axon from projection neurons during our dissociation protocol will transiently disrupt the plasma membrane allowing entry of the dye and thus identification of intact neuronal somata as evidenced from our robust single cell sequencing data.\nIncubate on ice for 5 min.\nNote: such dyes can exhibit toxicity to cells, and therefore incubation should not exceed 20 min.\nSpin cells at 300 g for 10 min at 4°C.\nCarefully remove supernatant with a P1000 pipette, being careful to not disturb the loose pellet.\nResuspend in 500μL dissociation buffer and triturate very carefully with a P1000 pipette to resuspend the cells.\nRun the final cell solution through a 35 μm nylon mesh cap of a round bottom polystyrene test tube to ensure no large debris is present in the sample.\nSorting the sample\nTiming: 45 min",
    "Load the nonfluorescent sample that has been incubated in cytoplasmic dye into the sorter to set the remaining gates (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nBackscatter width and backscatter height are set to exclude doublets.\nSorting based on far-red (the spectrum of the cytoplasmic dye) and tdTomato (fluorophore expressed by the neurons of interest) will allow for drawing of the gate to select for intact fluorescent neurons: tdTomato high, far-red (cytoplasmic dye) high.\nNote: For our experiments, we did not need to perform compensation using this sorter. This may differ if using different fluorophores or an alternate sorter.\nNote: When we sorted our retrogradely traced cells, the cells of interest were quite rare (0.88% of cells sorted) and the division between fluorescent and non-fluorescent cells could only be set by first sorting a negative control.\nUsing the gates drawn with the negative control, sort the samples.\nIf doing 10X sequencing or other droplet-based sequencing methods, sort the samples directly into a microfuge tube containing 500 μL of cold dissociation buffer. Immediately proceed to sequencing step.\nNote: Use the cell count obtained through sorting for estimation of the number of cells for 10X sequencing rather than using a cell counter- especially if collecting a rare or fragile population of neurons.\nNote: For our experiments, we collected between 2,000 and 10,000 cells and collected them into 500μl of cold dissociation buffer. As the chromium chip allows for a maximum loading volume of 34μl, we first spun down the collected cells at 500g for 5 min, and very carefully removed much of the supernatant. We then load all of the cells in 34μl of cold dissociation buffer into the chromium chip.\nIf using plate-based sequencing, sort directly into the plate.\nIf using cells for qPCR, sort up to 5 × 105 cells into 350μL of lysis buffer.",
    "If using cells for immunocytochemistry, sort directly into a 96-well plate into fix.\nIf using cells for long-term tissue culture, sort into 20μL of warm media per 10,000 cells sorted. Add 100μL of warm media along with the sorted cells into each well of a 0.01% poly-D-lysine- and 10 μg/mL laminin-coated 24-well plate. For best results, plate 30,000 cells per well. Allow to adhere for 30 min. Remove media to remove debris and replace with 500μL of warm media. Maintain with 50% media replacement every other day."
