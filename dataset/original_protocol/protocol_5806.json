    "Cell cultureThe PS1/PS2-deleted HTL cells are routinely grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS at 37 °C under a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.Treat the cells with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA at 37 °C for about 2 min. Dilute the cells to 0.4 x 106/ml with DMEM medium (supplemented with 10% [v/v] fetal bovine serum) and split at 50,000 per well into a 24-well plate one day prior to transfection.TransfectionPrepare a master mix for one sample:To a sterile 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, add:10 µl Opti-MEM medium0.195 µl X-tremeGENE 9 Transfection Reagent. Notes: Avoid touching the side of the tube while adding reagent.Make a master mix for larger sample numbers: for example, for 10 samples, multiply by 11 to prepare some extra mix. (10 x 11 = 110 µl medium; 0.195 x 11 = 2.145 µl X-tremeGENE 9 Transfection Reagent).Add 10 µl Opti-MEM medium per well in a 96-well plate and then add 65 ng total DNA into each well.Note: We usually dilute the DNA plasmids to a concentration of 100 ng/µl and store them at 4 °C. Add 10 µl master mix to DNA mix in each well of the 96-well plate and mix gently by pipetting. Incubate at room temperature for about 30 min.Carefully transfer 20 µl mix by pipetting into each well of cells cultured in a 24-well plate. Note: In this assay, 10 ng C99 (or its variants)-TEV site-rTA expression construct, 10 ng C99 (or its variants)-TEV protease construct and 5 ng of phRG-tk Renilla normalization luciferase expression vector were transfected together with 40 ng pBSK plasmid control into PS1/PS2-deleted HTL cells.Culture the cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.",
    "Luciferase measurementOne day post transfection, remove the medium from the cultured cells by vacuum pump attached by tubing to a liquid trap and a gel loading pipette tip, and gently apply a sufficient volume (i.e., 500 µl/well) of PBS (see Recipes) to rinse the bottom of each well. Dispense 100 µl of 1x PLB (see Recipes) into each well and gently shake the culture plate for 15 min at room temperature (e.g., 70 rpm).Note: We use Eppendorf® Research® Pro electronic single channel pipette (20-1,000 µl) to dispense the PLB buffer. However, any laboratory pipette that can be set to 100 µl can be used.Transfer 20 µl PLB lysate without cell debris to each well of a 96-well OptiPlate.Note: Generally, it is unnecessary to clear lysates of residual cell debris prior to performing the assay.Program the EnVision Multilabel Plate Reader to perform a 2-sec premeasurement delay, followed by a 10-sec measurement period using the Envision 96 Plate US Luminescence (700 nm emission filter) aperture for each reporter assay.Dispense 50 µl LAR2 substrate (see Recipes) into each well of the 96-well OptiPlate, mix by pipetting 2 or 3 times and measure Firefly luciferase activity using EnVision Multilabel Plate Reader. The Luminescence reads represent the Firefly luciferase activity.Dispense 50 µl Stop & Glo® Reagent (see Recipes) into the same plate, mix by pipetting 2 or 3 times and measure the Renilla luciferase activity by EnVision Multilabel Plate Reader. The Luminescence reads represent the Renilla luciferase activity.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171116/20171116004417_4220.jpg"
