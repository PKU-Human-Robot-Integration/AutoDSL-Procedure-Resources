    "1. Microfluidic device fabrication\nSU-8 master fabrication\n\t\nDesign the negative mask for the microfluidic channels for Device A and B (Supplemental File 1 and 2) using computer-assisted design software and have them printed on circuit board film with at least 10 µm resolution.\nPlace a clean 75 mm silicon wafer on a spin coater and pour about 1 mL of SU-8 onto its center. Turn on the vacuum to secure the wafer to the chuck.\nFor Device A, spin coat SU-8 2150 at 500 rpm for 30 s, followed by 30 s at 2,750 rpm. For Device B, spin-coat SU-8 2100 at 500 rpm for 30 s, followed by 30 s at 2,500 rpm. This will yield SU-8 layers of thickness 200 µm and 120 µm, respectively.\nRemove the wafer from the spin-coater and place on a hotplate at 95 °C for 60 min to soft bake.\nRemove the wafer from the hotplate and let it cool down to room temperature. Place the mask on top of the wafer, and expose under a collimator 190 mW, 365 nm UV LED for 2 min.\nPlace the wafer on a hotplate set at 95 °C for 5 min for postexposure baking.\nRemove the wafer and let it cool down to room temperature. Place the wafer in a bath of propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PGMEA) for 20 min.\nRinse the wafer with PGMEA followed by isopropanol. If any opaque residue is visible during this process, repeat the rinsing with PGMEA and isopropanol. Air dry the wafer.\nPlace the wafer on a hotplate at 95 °C for 3 min.\nRemove and place the wafer in a 90 mm diameter Petri dish.\nPolydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) casting on SU-8 master",
    "Mix together a 10:1 mass ratio of silicone base to curing agent. Degas the PDMS after mixing for about 30 min.\nPour degassed PDMS on top of the SU-8 master until at least a 5 mm thick layer is formed on top of the wafer.\nDegas the PDMS on top of the wafer for about 30 min.\nPlace the wafer in a 65 °C oven for at least 80 min to cure the PDMS.\nCut out the cured PDMS slab from the wafer.\nPlace the PDMS slab with the microfluidic features facing upwards, and punch inlet and outlet holes with a 0.75 mm biopsy punch.\nClean a 50 mm x 75 mm glass slide with isopropanol and remove all dust from the microfluidic features side of the PDMS slab with tape.\nExpose the cleaned glass slide and the PDMS slab with the microfluidic features face up to 100 Pa (1 mbar O2) plasma for 1 min.\nPlace the PDMS slab with the features face down onto the glass slide to allow for bonding. Place the slide in a 65 °C oven for at least 30 min to complete bonding.\nTreat all microfluidic channels by flushing with a fluorinated surface treatment fluid. Bake the device in a 65 °C oven for at least 10 min to evaporate the fluid.\n2. Yeast encapsulation in hydrogels using Device A\nTake yeast growing in a suspension culture and count on a hemocytometer.\nResuspend the cells in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to a concentration of about 750 k/mL. This ensures that 30% of hydrogels will have one yeast cell in them. Only about half of yeast cells grow into colonies, leading to ~15% of hydrogels containing yeast colonies.",
    "Mix ultralow melting point agarose at 2% w/v in PBS and heat at 90 °C until melted. This takes ~10 min.\nLoad the agarose mix into a syringe with an attached 0.22 µm filter into a syringe pump in front of the space heater set to 80 °C.\nLoad a syringe filled with the yeast suspension and a syringe containing fluorinated oil with 2% w/v ionic fluorosurfactant18 into syringe pumps.\nTake the coflow drop splitter device made in section 1 and connect the tubing from the syringes into the device. Guide the tubing from the outlet into a 15 mL conical tube in an ice bucket for drop collection.\nFlow in the three solutions into the device with the following flow rates:\n\t\nFlow the yeast suspension with the flow rate of 3 mL/h.\nFlow the agarose mixture at the flow rate of 3 mL/h.\nFlow the fluorinated oil at the flow rate of 15 mL/h.\nCollect about 1 mL of emulsion. Wait an additional 5 min to allow the agarose to fully set.\n3. Breaking and washing gel for culture\nAdd an equal volume of 20% perfluorooctanol (PFO) in fluorinated oil to the emulsion. Invert the conical tube a few times to allow for the mixing.\nSpin down the broken emulsion at 2,000 x g for 2 min. The gels will pellet above the oil and PFO phases.\nRemove the oil phase and add 2 mL of TE-TW buffer (10 mM Tris pH = 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.01% Tween-20) to resuspend the gels. Transfer the suspension into a new 15 mL conical tube.\nPellet down the gels as in step 3.2 and wash one more time in TE-TW for a total of two washes.",
    "Remove supernatant and resuspend gels in 2 mL of media. Transfer to a 5 mL culture tube.\nIncubate at 30 °C overnight under shaking.\n\tNOTE: After the overnight incubation, yeast hydrogels can be kept at 4 °C for several days.\n4. Yeast colony lysis\nTransfer gels to a 15 mL conical tube and pellet hydrogels at 2,000 x g for 2 min.\nWash hydrogels in PBS 2x.\nWash in 1x spheroplasting buffer 1x.\nPerform a 2–50x dilution of spheroplasting enzyme in spheroplasting buffer and add 1 mL to the hydrogels.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 1 h. The treated yeast will look more transparent (Figure 3A).\nTake the bottom 0.8 mL of hydrogel suspension and transfer into a 1 mL uncapped syringe.\nPlace the syringe in the 3D printed syringe holder (Supplemental file 3) and spin at 2,000 x g for 2 min. This will cause the hydrogels to close pack in the syringe head.\n5. mRNA capture from lysed yeast colonies using Device B\nTake 240,000 Drop-Seq beads and transfer into a 15 mL conical tube.\nPellet Drop-Seq beads by spinning down at 1,000 x g for 1 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend beads in 2 mL of 0.9x yeast lysis buffer with 500 mM sodium chloride for a bead suspension concentration of 120,000 beads/mL.\nTransfer the bead suspension to a 3 mL syringe with a stir bar inserted.\nPrepare a syringe containing several milliliters of 2% w/v perfluoropolyether-polyethylene glycol (PFPE-PEG) surfactant in fluorinated oil.\nEvacuate all the aqueous head of the syringe containing close-packed hydrogels and cap the syringe.\nInsert the hydrogel, bead suspension, and oil syringes into syringe pumps and connect via tubing into the encapsulation device made in section 1.\nConnect from the outlet tubing into a 50 mL conical tube on ice.",
    "Flow in the three solutions into the device with the following flow rates:\n\t\nFlow the hydrogels at 0.4 mL/h.\nFlow the bead suspension at 0.4 mL/h.\nFlow the fluorinated oil at 1.6 mL/h.\nCollect ~1 mL of emulsion or run the device until there are no more hydrogels left.\n6. cDNA generation, sequencing library preparation, and sequencing\nAdd 30 mL of 6x SSC buffer and 1 mL of PFO to the collected emulsion as stated in the Drop-Seq protocol14.\nContinue to follow the Drop-Seq protocol to generate cDNA from mRNA captured on beads, sequencing library preparation, and sequencing data analysis."
