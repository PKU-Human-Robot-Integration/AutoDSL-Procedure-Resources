    "The procedure for immunoblotting (Western blotting) was developed in the early 1980s. Subsequent advances in monoclonal antibody production, secondary antibody fluorophore conjugation, transfer methods, visualization strategies, and methods for quantification have made immunoblotting a workhorse method for quantifying biochemical changes in cells (Janes, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-bib-0026]). In this protocol denatured cell lysates are resolved by size via reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE); other protein separation methods such native, nonreducing, and 2D methods may be substituted. Proteins are loaded onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes via wet electrophoretic transfer, and cellular components are then quantified via antibody recognition of epitopes and subsequent coupling to a luminescent readout. This protocol contains instructions for quantification of total protein and phosphoprotein content with near-infrared imaging of fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies. Near-infrared imaging (LI-COR Odyssey or equivalent) has a broad dynamic range amenable to densitometry quantification in LI-COR Image Studio Lite or other software package (e.g., NIH ImageJ; see Internet Resources). The Alternate Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-prot-0002] describes visualization of blots by chemiluminescence imaging.",
    "We describe a method for stimulating adherent BMDMs with depleted zymosan, a β-glucan preparation that binds the hemi-ITAM-containing receptor Dectin-1 (Underhill, 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-bib-0059]). This representative cell-activating stimulus can be coupled with pharmacological, transcriptional, or genetic disruption of tyrosine kinase function to test the contribution of these kinases to cell signaling. Alternative receptor ligation or inhibition of analog-sensitive Csk (CskAS) by the small molecule 3-IB-PP1 can be used as an alternative to Dectin-1 clustering. In the latter approach, 3-IB-PP1 inhibits a sensitized form of Csk, the tyrosine kinase that negatively regulates the Src family tyrosine kinases (SFKs). When CskAS is inhibited, SFKs become activated and initiate signaling through many pathways (see Background Information; Brian et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-bib-0004]; Freedman et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-bib-0017]; Schoenborn, Tan, Zhang, Shokat, & Weiss, 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-bib-0053]; Tan et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-bib-0057]). Dectin-1 ligation is a useful positive control for myeloid cell activation via tyrosine kinase–dependent signaling (Freedman et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-bib-0017]; Goodridge et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-bib-0020]), but the choice of controls for a given experiment should reflect the cell and pathway of interest.

Grow BMDMs according to published protocols (Freedman et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-bib-0017]; Zhu, Brdicka, Katsumoto, Lin, & Weiss, 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-bib-0061]). Seed BMDMs on 150-mm2 plates.\nThe type of plate or flask and the preparation procedure depends on the model system.\n2. On day 6 or 7, detach adherent BMDMs: Aspirate medium and wash once with PBS. Dispense 8 ml cell dissociation buffer. Return cells to incubator for ≤15 min, tapping to see if cells separate from the plastic. Remove cells by repeatedly pipetting cell dissociation buffer over the plate surface and rinsing once with fresh PBS. Centrifuge cells 5 min at 400 × g, 4°C. Resuspend cells in DMEM-10 and count.\n3. Transfer cells to 6-well plate (106 cells per 2 ml DMEM-10 with or without polarization agents).",
    "Each well within a single plate can contain a separate genotype, polarization condition, or treatment condition within a single time point.\nThe number of cells required for analysis will depend on the quality of the primary antibody and the expression level and modification stoichiometry of the target protein. If more lysate is needed, multiple identical wells can be prepared, or a larger plate can be used. Duplicate wells are preferable if a centrifugation step is part of subsequent cell treatment (e.g., depleted zymosan).\n4. Rest BMDMs overnight at 37°C in a 10% CO2 incubator.\nAdherent cells such as BMDMs should be seeded onto plates and rested overnight prior to stimulation. Cells cultured in suspension (e.g., Jurkat T cells or mast cells) can be stimulated in sterile 1.5-ml polypropylene tubes and require less resting—on the order of minutes (T cells) to hours (mast cells), optimized to minimize basal signaling.\n5. Prewarm a midspeed centrifuge to 37°C by spinning at 6000 × g.\nWarming time will vary depending on the centrifuge.\n6. Prepare 0.5 ml depleted zymosan in DMEM-10 with or without kinase inhibitor (e.g., 20 µM PP2, a SFK inhibitor) for each stimulation and time point.\nOwing to poor aqueous solubility, most inhibitors will need to be diluted from a concentrated stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide or other solvent. Appropriate controls, including vehicle-only treatments, are therefore important. For some inhibitors, efficacy may be increased if cells are pretreated prior to stimulation; this must be optimized for the particular cell or condition. Most kinase inhibitors, including PP2, inhibit multiple kinases (see Background Information). For each inhibitor it is important to be familiar with these potential side effects and to use a minimum effective dose to avoid inhibiting secondary pathways (Knight & Shokat, 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-bib-0029]).",
    "7. Gently remove 1.5 ml DMEM-10 supernatant from each well, and return plates to incubators for at least 10 min to re-equilibrate the temperature.\n8. Gently apply 0.5 ml sonicated and washed depleted zymosan or 3-IB-PP1 with or without kinase inhibitor (or alternative stimulation/perturbation). Quickly but gently place plates in the prewarmed centrifuge, and pulse spin 30 s at 5000 × g to synchronize deposition of depleted zymosan particles onto cells.\nFor short incubation times plates may remain in the stationary, warmed centrifuge. For longer time points plates should be gently returned to the incubator to ensure temperature stability.\n9. Stop signaling at the desired time point by placing the plate on ice. Quickly aspirate supernatant.\nTime points will likely need to be optimized. Many receptors will induce phosphorylation cascades within a few seconds and peak by 5 to 30 min. To analyze longer-term changes in signaling or transcription or feedback-induced changes in cell activation, time scales on the order of hours or days may be appropriate. To determine the immediate roles of a particular tyrosine kinase, it is best to start with a shorter time window to evaluate direct or immediate downstream effects.\n10. Lyse cells by adding 200 to 400 µl SDS sample buffer and DTT to 50 mM. Scrape cells off plate, and incubate at 37°C for 5 min. Pipette cell lysates into labeled 1.5-ml snap-lock tubes.\nThe snap-lock feature prevents tubes from popping open during later boiling steps.\n11. Lyse cells and shear DNA by sonication with chilling (e.g., three times for 1 min at 50% duty cycle with a chilled Diagenode Bioruptor Pico).\n12. Incubate samples 15 min at ≥99°C. Microcentrifuge samples 30 s at 10,000 × g, room temperature.",
    "Samples can be refrigerated or frozen until further analysis: 4°C for short-term, −20°C for medium-term, or −80°C for long-term storage.\nIf samples are refrigerated or frozen before blotting, warm them to ≥37°C, pulse centrifuge, and remix before running SDS-PAGE. If sample quality deteriorates, fresh DTT may be added and samples reboiled. Samples can usually undergo freeze-thaw cycles several times before their quality deteriorates.\nGel electrophoresis and wet transfer\n13. Prepare running buffer and transfer buffer.\nThis protocol has been optimized for Tris-acetate gels. See manufacturer instructions for running conditions for other types of gels.\n14. Prepare gels by removing the comb from the gel and rinsing each lane with running buffer to remove gel fragments.\n15. Load ∼2.5 × 104 cell equivalents into each lane, taking care not to puncture the gel. For best results load the same volume in each well. Load the left-most lane with molecular weight marker. Include positive and negative controls on each gel to facilitate quantification across blots. Load unused wells with SDS sample buffer.\nThe loading strategy is appropriate for immunoblots from whole-cell lysates for moderately expressed proteins using near-infrared imaging. Optimization may be needed if probing extremely abundant or rare proteins, events, or immunoprecipitates.\nIf blots will later be cut horizontally, straight cutting may be facilitated by loading two- to three-times diluted (to indicate left to right directionality) molecular weight marker in the right-most lane. If blots will be cut vertically, it is advisable to use marker lanes between segments (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-fig-0001]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1a3b4edb-663c-480f-ac19-3cec0956dc83/cpim104-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1",
    "Suggested cutting/notching technique for blots. (A) Using molecular weight (MW) ladders as a guide, membranes can be cut to increase antibody multiplexing. Notches are shown to ensure correct membrane orientation. (B) Theoretical staining of a membrane using different antibodies on different membrane sections. (C) Using MW markers as a guide, membranes can be cut vertically to increase sample processing. Notches are shown to ensure correct membrane orientation.\n16. Fill electrophoresis module with running buffer, and apply constant voltage (150 V) until the dye front has migrated out of the gel or the desired separation has occurred (∼80 min).\nThe time and voltage will depend on the size of the target protein(s) and the gel and buffer system being used.\n17. While the gel is running, prepare transfer apparatus. Cut Immobilon-FL PVDF membrane to size, and rinse membrane in methanol to activate. Rinse three times with distilled water. Place membrane in transfer buffer.\nMany types of PVDF and nitrocellulose membranes are available commercially. Ensure that the membrane is suitable for use with fluorescent secondary antibodies (e.g., “FL” designation) to minimize background. If chemiluminescence detection is more accessible, refer to the Alternate Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-prot-0002] for the appropriate membrane.\nThis protocol uses wet transfer methodology, which generally produces the highest-quality results across a wide range of molecular weights. See manufacturer's instructions for semi-dry transfer buffers and setup.\n18. Assemble transfer apparatus according to the manufacturer's instructions. Place one corner of the membrane on top of the gel. Slowly place the opposite corner of the membrane onto gel, and lower the rest of the membrane onto the gel, taking care to avoid trapping bubbles. Orient transfer with the membrane on the positive (anode) side and gel on the negative (cathode) side.",
    "19. Fill inner and outer chambers of the apparatus with cold transfer buffer. Place on ice or in a cold room.\nChilling is critical for minimizing heat deformation of the gel during transfer.\n20. Transfer 1.75 hr at low voltage (30 V) on ice.\nThe timing and voltage may need to be optimized.\n21. Remove membrane from the apparatus, and dry in between two sheets of clean filter paper to fix proteins onto the membrane.\nHandle the membrane minimally, wearing clean gloves and using clean tweezers to touch only the edges. We recommend notching the blot in the upper corner with a clean razor blade to delineate front versus back and left versus right directionality.\nTotal protein staining\n22. Place membrane in an incubation box, and activate by soaking 1 min in methanol. Discard methanol and rinse three times for 30 s each with water.\n23. Add 5 ml total protein stain. Rock 5 min in the dark at room temperature.\nTotal protein stain is a more robust method for quantification than a single protein reference such as GAPDH, β-actin, or Erk1/2, although these typical loading controls are still useful in figures as visual aids. For quantification of phosphoproteins, it may be more appropriate to use an antibody specific to the protein of interest (modified vs unmodified) rather than a pan-total protein stain.\n24. Discard total protein stain, and wash two times for 30 s each with total protein wash.\n25. Rinse membrane three times with water, and image gel with a near-infrared imaging system.\n26. Rinse membrane briefly in water. Replace solution with total protein removal solution. Rock 5 min in the dark at room temperature.\nImmunoblotting\n27. Discard solution and place membrane in methanol.",
    "28. If cutting membrane into segments of different molecular weights, place membrane on clean filter paper, and cut with clean scissors or razor blade. Return to methanol.\n29. Discard methanol and rinse three times for 30 s each with water.\n30. Discard water. Rock 2 min in 5 to 10 ml TBS at room temperature.\n31. Discard TBS and add 5 to 10 ml blocking buffer. Rock 1 hr at room temperature in the dark.\nBlocking buffer may be purchased from commercial vendors (e.g., LI-COR) or made in-house with bovine serum albumin (BSA) or powdered milk. In our experience buffer purchased from LI-COR works very well.\nPowdered milk is generally a more effective blocking agent than BSA but may affect detection of phosphoproteins due to high background from the phosphoprotein casein.\nA blot may be left at 4°C in blocking solution overnight or even over a few days. For consistent results, however, blocking time should be kept relatively consistent.\n32. Dilute primary antibody in 4 to 6 ml (depending on the size of the container) of 1:1 blocking buffer:primary diluent.\nOptimal dilution will vary by antibody. Antibodies of different species can be combined in the same solution if multiple emission wavelength channels are available (e.g., rabbit-derived anti-phospho-Erk1/2 combined with mouse-derived anti-Erk1/2 imaged in separate channels).\nIf an antibody on an uncut gel is sufficiently specific as to produce a single band in a particular experimental condition, multiple antibodies of the same color and/or species may be pooled when detecting proteins separated by molecular weight. If there is any doubt about specificity, cut blots instead of combining antibodies.",
    "An optimal dilution of primary antibody should be evaluated by titration for each cell type and stimulation condition, but a good starting range is 1:1000 to 1:5000. With near-infrared imaging, primary antibodies can typically be diluted 2 to 20 times more than recommended by the manufacturer.\nMost primary antibody solutions can be used multiple times if stored at 4°C in sodium azide (NaN3).\n33. Discard blocking buffer, and add diluted primary antibody. Mix overnight at 4°C.\nIn some cases primary antibodies specific for abundant proteins or moieties can be applied for 1 hr at room temperature. For best reproducibility, keep a consistent incubation time.\n34. Remove and store diluted primary antibody. Wash membrane three times for 5 min each with TBST.\n35. Dilute secondary antibody in 1:1 blocking buffer:secondary diluent.\nDilution of the secondary antibody should be optimized for each condition. For near-infrared detection, secondary antibodies are typically used at 1:10,000 to 1:20,000. When combining secondary antibodies to image two proteins on a near-infrared imager, use the brighter, 800-nm channel for lower-abundance or phosphorylated proteins and the dimmer, 700-nm channel for higher-abundance proteins.\n36. Incubate 1 hr at room temperature.\n37. Wash three times for 5 min each with TBST.\n38. Wash 2 min with TBS to remove residual Tween-20.\n39. Dry membrane between two sheets of clean filter paper.\n40. Image membrane protein-side down using a near-infrared imager.\nIn rare cases total protein stain can decrease the signal in subsequent blots. If troubleshooting is necessary, consider skipping steps 22 to 26.\nQuantification of total protein by densitometry\n41. Select appropriate fluorescence channel in the right-hand Display tab of Image Studio Lite.",
    "42. In the Analysis tab, select Draw Rectangle. Draw a rectangle around the entire lane of interest (test darkest lane first). Rotate or resize box using the graph in the right-hand Profile tab. Move box to the left-most lane, duplicate, and drag boxes to the other lanes. Adjust each box, if necessary, using the Profile tab.\nThe software will take box size into account, but it is best to keep the boxes uniform. Some lysates may have a very dark cluster of bands overlaid on a lighter lane background. It may be useful to exclude these major bands from the quantification to avoid signal skewing by a few undefined proteins. Boxes in this case can be drawn from the top of the lane and end before these bands. If the blot has imperfections, boxes may be redrawn to exclude them.\nIf bands for total protein or specific stains are round or bleed between lanes, less lysate should be loaded into future blots, if possible.\nBoxes may be rotated to account for lane slanting, but the gel image itself should not be rotated prior to densitometry analysis.\n43. In the Background pane, select User Defined for background quantification.\n44. Draw a small box in between two lanes with representative background fluorescence. In the Background tab, select Assign Shape to apply this box for background subtraction.\n45. Export data from the Shapes tab into Microsoft Excel or other spreadsheet manager. Use the background-corrected “Signal” column for data normalization and graphing.\nQuantification of immunoblots (repeat for each protein of interest)\n46. Select appropriate fluorescence channel in the right-hand Display tab of Image Studio Lite.",
    "47. In the Analysis tab, select Add Rectangle. Place a box on the image by clicking near the darkest band of interest. Rotate or resize the box using the graph in the right-hand Profile tab. Move box to the left-most lane, duplicate, and drag boxes to the other lanes. Adjust each box, if necessary, using the Profile tab.\nBoxes may be rotated to account for lane slanting, but the gel image itself should not be rotated prior to densitometry analysis.\n48. In the Background pane, select Median for background quantification. Adjust borders to top/bottom or right/left, and choose the background box size.\nThe directionality and size of background boxes will depend on the shape of the band being quantified, how well separated the lanes are, whether there are nonspecific or unidentified bands above or below the band of interest, and whether the lanes are generally higher in the background than the space in between lanes.\n49. Export data from the Shapes tab into Microsoft Excel or other spreadsheet manager. Use the background-corrected “Signal” column for data normalization and graphing.\nReport the abundance of a protein or modification relative to the total protein stain within the same lane. It may be appropriate to report post-translational modifications relative to a total protein immunoblot for the protein of interest. These two analytical approaches will reflect an overall dose in the cell population versus a more stoichiometry-like assessment of the degree of modification within the existing protein.\nIt may also be useful to perform a second normalization step relative to a reference (e.g., time = 0, wild-type, or unpolarized) value. This will obscure basal differences between treatment groups but clarify differences in kinetic response to the cell treatment or perturbation.",
    "Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies in conjunction with chemiluminescence imaging is another common approach to visualizing immunoblots. In contrast to direct dye conjugation in near-infrared imaging, HRP-adsorbed blots are developed by addition of an HRP substrate (a luminol/enhancer mixture) that generates a chemiluminescent signal from HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Although this method can in some cases be quantitative, the dynamic range is typically narrower than in near-infrared imaging, and it is easy to over- or under-produce signal in this indirect method. To achieve the best signal, gel loading, antibody dose, and substrate choice should be optimized. An advantage of this approach is that the HRP enzyme can be efficiently inactivated and the blot reprobed with a different set of antibodies.\nAdditional materials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-prot-0001])\nHRP-conjugated secondary antibody (e.g., Southern Biotech)\nSuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (e.g., Thermo Scientific, 34096)\nPlastic wrap\nLuminescence imager\n1. Complete steps 1 to 22 and steps 28 to 38 of Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-prot-0001] using HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for step 35.\nAs in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-prot-0001], the dilution of each antibody must be optimized. For chemiluminescence imaging, the primary antibody (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-prot-0001] step 32) will typically be diluted according to manufacturer's instructions. HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies are typically diluted 1:100,000.\nThe HRP enzyme is sensitive to azide (N3), so it is important to wash blots thoroughly after incubation with primary antibody.\nAs described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-prot-0001], with proper controls, antibodies can be combined if their output is highly specific and/or clearly identifiable by molecular weight.",
    "Unlike near-infrared fluorescence imaging, HRP antibody–bound membranes can be treated with NaN3 and frozen to inactivate the HRP enzyme. Blots can then be reprobed with different antibodies (Freedman et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-bib-0017]). This is especially useful if the second set of antibodies is derived from a different species to prevent fresh HRP secondary antibody binding to the previously adsorbed primary antibody.\nBuffers are marketed for stripping blotting antibodies from membranes. In our experience this can work but often not uniformly across the membrane surface, which can limit the fidelity of quantification. We recommend performing multiple blots rather than stripping if HRP activation is not sufficient to resolve different sets of proteins.\n2. Prepare substrate working solution by combining equal amounts of peroxide and enhancer solutions (from SuperSignal kit). Place membrane on a piece of plastic wrap, and pipet a minimum volume of substrate working solution onto the surface of the blot. Tilt membrane to thoroughly coat, and watch for bands to develop, following manufacturer's instructions.\nHRP working solution is stable for ∼8 hr and can be reused.\n3. Cover membrane in clear plastic, and smooth to remove bubbles. Image using a luminescence imaging system.\nThe linear range for chemiluminescence detection is much narrower than that of near-infrared imaging, so quantification should be approached with more caution. Check linearity using serial dilution of lysates or samples. If bands appear black on the edges and white in the middle (or the reverse, depending on the image display mode) or football- rather than bar-shaped, the image is likely overexposed. A range of substrate solutions with differential sensitivity (Femto, Pico, Atto) is available, so the substrate can be optimized for the abundance of the blotting target. The incubation time and lane loading can also be optimized.",
    "First described in the 1970s (Kessler, 1975[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-bib-0028]), immunoprecipitation is a common method for separating proteins from cell lysates in denaturing or nondenaturing conditions. It has been further refined for protein purification, enrichment of low-abundance species, and identification of protein complexes (co-immunoprecipitation). As a tool for studying cell signaling, immunoprecipitation typically starts with preparation of an antibody–bead complex (noncovalent in this protocol, covalent in the Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-prot-0004]). These antibody-coated beads are then mixed with cell lysates and gently tumbled under conditions that maximize protein capture but minimize protein degradation and further post-translational modification. The protein–antibody–bead complex is then collected, and the (co-)immunoprecipitated proteins are eluted for analysis (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-fig-0002]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3b88d8ce-e9d4-4771-97ee-4b4f4dc39683/cpim104-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nKey steps in co-immunoprecipitation. Cells are lysed with a nondenaturing detergent in the presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Protein quantification ensures comparability across different samples. Antibodies and beads are added to the lysate to enrich specific proteins or protein complexes. Noninteracting or weakly interacting proteins are removed by washing. The enriched proteins and complexes are then eluted for further analysis.\nThis protocol describes immunoprecipitation of a target protein from cell lysate. In the absence of the usual loading controls available in whole-cell lysate (described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-prot-0001]), a protein content normalization step is essential for quantitative analysis. The immunoprecipitation time, detergent, and salt content will determine the extent of interacting protein co-immunoprecipitation. The composition of the immunoprecipitate can then be probed by blotting for pan-phosphotyrosine, specific phosphorylation sites, total protein, or other epitopes to reveal protein–protein interactions and post-translational modifications that follow cell perturbation (as in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-prot-0001]). The immunoprecipitates can also be subjected to phosphoproteomics to identify unknown proteins or targeted mass spectrometry to quantify specific peptides and post-translational modifications. A targeted approach is described in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-prot-0005].\nMaterials",

    "2. Prebind immunoprecipitation antibody to beads by incubating 1 to 2 µg antibody per 40 × 106 cells with beads. Rotate beads at least 2 hr at room temperature prior to use.\nIn this protocol the immunoprecipitation antibody will co-elute with the target protein, possibly yielding dark bands caused by the antibody heavy chain at ∼50 to 70 kDa and the light chain at 25 kDa (Harlow & Lane, 1988[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-bib-0022]). Secondary antibodies may even react across species owing to the sheer abundance of the antibody bands. For optimal visualization and quantification of proteins close to either molecular weight, it is advisable to use covalent conjugation to prevent antibody elution from the beads. One such method is described in the Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-prot-0004].\n3. Add protease and phosphatase inhibitors to an aliquot of chilled lauryl maltoside lysis buffer. Protect from light and keep on ice until use.\nWe have had the most success using lauryl maltoside detergent for cell lysis and immunoprecipitation. Other detergents, such as NP-40 alternative, can decrease the number of loosely interacting proteins that co-immunoprecipitate with the target.\nDetergent choice should be tailored to experimental needs (Firestein, Gabriel, McInnes, & O'Dell, 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-bib-0016]; Johnson, 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-bib-0027]).\nNP-40 alternative is less expensive than lauryl maltoside and can be substituted in wash steps.\n4.

    "8. Sonicate cells (5 min total, 50% duty cycle in a Diagenode Bioruptor Pico) to disrupt membranes, break up protein aggregates, and shear DNA.\n9. Centrifuge lysate 15 min at 15,000 × g in a chilled microcentrifuge to remove insoluble material.\nMicro-ultracentrifugation at 90,000 × g for 15 min may be used in place of sonication and benchtop microcentrifugation.\nImmunoprecipitation\n10. Preclear samples by adding 50 µl protein G Sepharose beads and 10 µl normal serum per 1 ml lysate. Rotate 30 min at 4°C.\nThe normal serum should be species matched to the immunoprecipitation antibody. Also, tailor the preclearance mode to the bead/functionalization.\n11. Collect beads by centrifuging 2 min at 500 × g in a chilled microcentrifuge, and transfer precleared supernatant to new tube. Keep all tubes on ice.\n12. Mix 50 µl whole-cell lysate with 50 µl immunoprecipitation elution buffer for later immunoblot.\n13. Remove 50 µl lysate for BCA assay (see manufacturer's instructions). Calculate protein concentration in each sample, and aliquot corrected volumes of lysate into LoBind tubes.\nThis BCA step is important for quantitative analysis because immunoprecipitates lack the usual loading controls, namely housekeeping proteins and/or a true total protein stain. Users can expect to recover 50 µg protein per 106 cells. However, this will vary based on cell type and lysis.\n14. Wash antibody–beads two times with PBS, discarding supernatant. Resuspend antibody–beads in lauryl maltoside lysis buffer, and portion evenly among lysate samples.\n15. Tumble lysates and beads 2 hr at 4°C to immunoprecipitate protein of interest.\nImmunoprecipitation time can be optimized. Longer incubation times (e.g., overnight) may allow protein complexes to dissociate or increase the efficiency of pulldown, depending on the sample. Longer incubation times can also lead to protease-mediated sample degradation.",
    "16. Apply samples to spin columns. Centrifuge 2 min at 450 × g, 4°C. Mix 50 µl flow-through with 50 µl immunoprecipitation elution buffer for immunodepleted blotting samples.\nIf spin columns are unavailable, collect beads by centrifugation, and remove supernatant via pipetting. With this approach, bead loss and less-efficient washing may decrease the reproducibility of later quantification steps, but these issues can be minimized with conservative removal of supernatant and increased number or volume of wash steps.\nFor enzyme assays or other applications, do not apply samples to spin columns or elute with denaturing (SDS-containing) immunoprecipitation elution buffer.\n17. Wash beads and column five times with 1 ml NP-40 alternative wash buffer, centrifuging 2 min at 450 × g, 4°C, and discarding flow-through between washes.\nTo avoid disrupting protein complexes, it may be desirable to continue using lauryl maltoside or other detergent instead of NP-40 alternative.\n18. Elute immunoprecipitated protein by applying enough immunoprecipitation elution buffer to cover the beads in the spin column. Incubate 15 min at room temperature. Elute 5 min at 10,000 × g, 4°C, in a microcentrifuge.\n19. Incubate lysate and immunoprecipitate samples 5 min at ≥99°C. Centrifuge samples 1 min at 10,000 × g, 4°C.

To assess the efficiency of immunoprecipitation and the general stoichiometry of co-immunoprecipitated protein binding, run immunoblots with whole-cell and immunodepleted lysates, as described in steps 13 to 46 of Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-prot-0001]. Assess immunoprecipitates by immunoblot, skipping the total protein stain in steps 22 to 26 of Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-prot-0001].\nImmunoprecipitates can be further probed by immunoblotting as described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-prot-0001] or by targeted mass spectrometry as described in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-prot-0005]. These samples can also be analyzed using unbiased mass spectrometry.",
    "In some cases, it is best to conjugate immunoprecipitation antibodies covalently to immunoprecipitation beads rather than co-eluting antibodies with the immunoprecipitate samples. For immunoblotting analysis (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-prot-0001]), covalently conjugated antibody–beads complexes produce cleaner images, facilitating visualization and quantification of proteins comigrating with the heavy and light chains. Covalent conjugation is also ideal for subsequent mass spectrometry analysis (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-prot-0005]) in that resulting immunoprecipitates can be desalted and run directly without further purification of proteins or detergents that would otherwise harm the mass spectrometer.

    "Commercial antibodies are not available for every protein epitope and post-translational modification. Antibodies may be raised against custom sequences, but this process is costly and at times problematic. Mass spectrometry is a valuable tool for detecting changes in protein homeostasis and identifying novel sites of modification prior to investing in antibody generation. We present a protocol for quantifying phosphorylation on an immunoprecipitated protein via targeted liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) on a high-resolution mass spectrometer. Traditional, data-dependent acquisition triggers fragmentation of the top N ions in a MS1 scan (the first component of MS/MS), effectively surveying the most abundant populations of ions. PRM instead uses precursor ion selection to trigger fragmentation of modified peptides of interest and creating full-scan MS2 spectra, improving selectivity, sensitivity, and signal-to-noise ratios (Rauniyar, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-bib-0048]). This protocol may be adapted for other epitopes or modifications and for kinase (or other) activity assays for probing modification of a target site in cells, lysates, or recombinant proteins.\nWe describe steps to ensure accurate peptide identification and quantification using a heavy isotope–labeled internal standard. Prior to beginning proteolytic in-gel digestion, a BCA assay is used to quantify the total protein concentration in cell lysates, a critical step for normalizing phosphopeptide levels across samples. Subsequently, protein concentrations are determined using a standard curve of titrated BSA, quantified by densitometry after SDS-PAGE. This ensures that phosphopeptide quantification can be expressed as a concentration ratio relative to the amount of protein subjected to tryptic digest. Finally, a stable isotope–labeled reference peptide is spiked into the immunoprecipitate prior to proteolytic digestion. Peptide concentrations can then be definitively identified and placed on an absolute scale via a peptide standard curve (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-fig-0003]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/72364bdb-8142-4f7f-b2ec-c36940ebd58a/cpim104-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3",
    "Key steps for in-gel digestion and targeted LC-MS/MS. Immunoprecipitated samples are resolved via gel electrophoresis and excised based on molecular weight. Protein standards (e.g., bovine serum albumin [BSA]) of known concentration are used to quantify gel loading to standardize loading of immunoprecipitate samples onto the LC-MS/MS and normalizing later peptide or phosphopeptide analysis. A reference quantity of isotope-labeled reference peptide, to be used as an internal standard, is added to the gel fragments. The gel sample/peptide mixture is subjected to protease digest and targeted LC-MS/MS analysis. By comparing the endogenous and isotope-labeled phosphopeptide peaks and peptide standard curves, molar and relative quantities of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides can be calculated.\nMaterials\nImmunoprecipitated samples (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-prot-0003])\nSDS sample buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-rec-0014])\nBCA protein assay kit (e.g., Thermo Scientific, 23225)\nTris-acetate protein gel (e.g., Fisher Scientific, EA03585BOX)\nSimplyBlue SafeStain (e.g., Invitrogen, LC6065)\n100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (e.g., JT Baker, 300301)\nAcetonitrile, HPLC grade (e.g., Fisher Scientific, A955-4)\nDTT (e.g., Fisher Scientific, BP172)\nIodoacetamide (e.g., Sigma-Aldrich, I1149)\nTrypsin digest solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-rec-0021])\nReference peptides (e.g., Sigma-Aldrich)\nCustom-synthesized 13C,15N-heavy isotope amino acid–labeled reference peptide corresponding to digested phosphopeptide of interest\nCustom-synthesized unlabeled phosphorylated peptide standard corresponding to digested phosphopeptide of interest\nCaCl2 (e.g., Honeywell-Fluka, C1016100G)\nFormic acid (e.g., Fisher Scientific, A117-50)\nWater, HPLC grade (e.g., Fisher Scientific, W6-4)\nDesalting wash solvent (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-rec-0004])\nTrifluoroacetic acid\nDesalting wetting solvent (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-rec-0005])\nDesalting elution solvent (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-rec-0003])\nCalibration curve buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-rec-0002])\nHPLC buffer A (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-rec-0007])\nHPLC buffer B (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-rec-0008])\nCentrifugal filter column (e.g., Millipore, UFC500324)\nElectrophoresis system (e.g., Invitrogen, EI0002)\nNear-infrared imaging system (e.g., LI-COR Odyssey)\nRazor blade\n1.5-ml LoBind microcentrifuge tubes (e.g., Eppendorf, 022431081)\nVortex\nMicrocentrifuge\nVariable temperature incubator\nVacuum concentrator (e.g., SpeedVac; Thermo Scientific, SPD140DDA)\nC18 reverse-phase extraction disk (e.g., 3M, 2240/2340)\n18-G needle",

    "The precise concentration of heavy-labeled reference peptide spiked in during in-gel digest will depend on the final yield of protein extracted from the gel. This can be estimated by densitometry from the BSA curve generated after SDS-PAGE. However, we suggest doing a trial run to ensure the spiked-in reference peptide is not orders of magnitude higher or lower in concentration than the peptides of interest. Trypsin, which cuts at lysine and arginine residues (Ma, Tang, & Lai, 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-bib-0038]), is often the protease of choice. If the distribution of lysine and arginine around the sequence of interest is suboptimal for LC-MS/MS detection, another protease such as chymotrypsin, LysC, or LysN (Giansanti, Tsiatsiani, Low, & Heck, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-bib-0019]) may be used to optimize digested peptide m/z and facilitate detection.\n18.

Remove solvent by vacuum concentration (e.g., SpeedVac), and store at −80°C indefinitely.\nPeptide desalting",
    "25. Assemble desalting tips by punching two holes from C18 reverse-phase extraction material with an 18-G needle and expelling into a 200-μl pipet tip using a clean capillary tube (Rappsilber, Ishihama, & Mann, 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-bib-0046]; Rappsilber, Mann, & Ishihama, 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-bib-0047]).\n26. Add 60 µl desalting wash solvent to vacuum-dried peptide samples. Vortex 45 s and centrifuge 1 min at 3000 × g, room temperature. Add more trifluoroacetic acid if necessary to adjust pH ≤3.\n27.

Dilute 1000 fmol heavy isotope–labeled phosphorylated peptide standard in calibration curve buffer into several LoBind tubes.\n33. To create a calibration curve to quantify the amount phosphorylated peptide, add increasing concentrations of unlabeled phosphorylated peptide standard so that the molar ratio of unlabeled phosphorylated peptide standard:heavy-labeled phosphorylated peptide standard spans 0.1 to 1.5.\nThe precise molar ratios will depend on the assay and the amount of phosphorylated peptide in each sample.\n34. Dilute 1000 fmol phosphorylated peptide standard in calibration curve buffer into several LoBind tubes.\n35. To create a calibration curve to quantify the ratio of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptide in each sample, add increasing amounts of unphosphorylated peptide standard such that the molar ratio ranges from 0.05 to 1.5.",
    "The peptide ratios used in this calibration curve will depend on the stoichiometry of tyrosine phosphorylation and may need to be adjusted depending on the rarity of phosphorylation for a given phosphorylation site.\n36. Submit calibration curve samples and in-gel digested samples for LC-MS/MS (steps 37 to 42).\nLC-MS/MS\n37. Load a 75-cm × 100-µm silica PicoTip Emitter column for nanospray with ReproSil-Pur 1.9-mm C18 AQ.\n38. Mount loaded PicoTip Emitter column in a nanospray source in line with an Orbitrap Fusion with 2.1 kV spray voltage in the positive mode and heated capillary maintained at 275°C.\n39. Set up a tripartite peptide elution program decreasing the fraction of HPLC buffer A and increasing the fraction of HPLC buffer B with a 300 nl/min flow rate:\n         \n5% to 10% HPLC buffer B over 5 min\n10% to 16% HPLC buffer B over 40 min\n16% to 26% HPLC buffer B over 5 min.\nThe elution program should be optimized depending on the m/z and hydrophobicity of the target peptide and desired resolution. This step presents a general starting point in three gradient stages.\n40. Define an acquisition method comprising a full scan and PRM to detect singly, doubly, and triply charged precursor ions without scheduling. Set the full scan event to employ a 380 to 1500 m/z selection, an Orbitrap resolution of 60,000 (at m/z 200), a target automatic gain control (AGC) value of 4 × 105, and maximum ion injection time of 50 ms. Set the PRM scan to employ an Orbitrap resolution of 30,000 (at m/z 200) and a target AGC value of 5 × 104 and/or maximum ion injection time of 54 ms to ensure that enough fragment ions are captured for MS/MS detection.",
    "The acquisition method and scan events will vary depending on the chemical composition of the targets and the number of peptides analyzed in a given experiment. When there are few peptides, method development can be simplified by monitoring selected precursor ions for the duration of the chromatography gradient. For quantitative experiments, a selected peptide must be surveyed and an MS2 acquired at least 10 times across the extracted ion chromatogram (EIC). Scheduling may be used when the number of possible peptide precursors is >20 in order to capture 10 MS2 scans across a peptide chromatogram.\nQuantification can be performed using MS1 or MS2 (the two components of MS/MS) EICs in the Skyline software package (see Internet Resources). A full spectrum scan facilitates assessment of dynamic range issues, co-eluting peptides, and complexity of the sample and acts as an additional validation of accurate mass for the peptide of interest. The m/z range defined above surveys all ions with a charge >1. At the above resolution EICs can be used to uniquely identify co-eluting peptides with small m/z differences so they can be fragmented individually for identification by MS2. Fill time is simply the time we allow the ions to fill the chamber.\n41. Set the MS2 quadrupole isolation window to 1.6 m/z. Perform fragmentation with a higher-energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) of 30%, and collect an MS2 scan from 100 to 1000 m/z.\nHCD will depend on peptide chemistry and phosphorylation site sequence context, so it will have to be optimized (Diedrich, Pinto, & Yates, 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-bib-0012]).\n42. Collect PRM data in centroid mode, and export for quantification.\nCentroid data acquisition decreases file size.\nData analysis using Skyline\nConfiguration",
    "43. Analyze data in the Skyline Targeted Mass Spec program (see Internet Resources; MacLean et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-bib-0039]; Pino et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.104#cpim104-bib-0045]). Open the Skyline Start Page, and select Blank Document and Save As.\n44. Select the Settings tab, and locate Peptide Settings. Input parameters to reflect the experimental settings.\nPeptide Settings parameters can vary depending on a variety of factors, including digestion enzyme, peptide length, peptide modifications, cleavage sites, and type of internal standard.\n45. In the Settings tab locate Transition Settings.\nTransition Settings parameters vary according to a variety of factors—y and b ion series, precursor ions, charge states, mass accuracy, and method (targeted or untargeted) of LC-MS/MS acquisition.\n46. Navigate to the Edit tab, then Insert and Peptides. Enter the phosphorylated peptide sequences and select Insert.\nThe Targets list on the left Skyline panel will be populated.\nImporting and inspecting standard raw data\n47. Import raw mass spectrometer files into Skyline by navigating to File, Import, and Results. Choose Add single injection replicates in files and select OK, which will prompt the Import Results Files to show raw standard curve data files. Upload the selected files by choosing Open, followed by Do Not Remove when the option to remove the naming prefix appears. Confirm and close the window by selecting OK.\n48. Using raw files generated from standards (e.g., heavy isotope and light isotope phosphopeptides), inspect the chromatographic traces for quality control.",
    "If chromatographic peaks have a non-Gaussian peak shape, the samples and standards should be rerun for quality assurance. Inconsistent LC retention times could reflect inadequate chromatographic resolution. Phosphopeptide transition ions should be chosen based on relative signal intensity of their EIC and selected for ions that are representative of larger y or b ions in the peptide fragmentation series. For example, a 10-mer peptide may fragment to yield a y9 ion, but the y8 ion may exhibit an EIC that is higher intensity and should thus be selected for quantification. Peptide sequence and length also affect selection of transitions for peptide validation and quantification.\n49. Manually inspect each peptide-extracted product ion chromatogram.\nIsotope labeling should not affect the retention time of otherwise identical peptides. Selected transitions should exhibit proportional distributions.\nAnalyzing PRM data from samples\n50. Import raw sample files into Skyline as described in step 47.\n51. Inspect chromatographic traces, retention times, and fragmentation patterns of heavy and light phosphorylated peptides in each sample.\nGenerating a calibration curve\n52. Define concentrations of external standards. To do so, go to the View tab, and select Document Grid.\n53. Go to the top-left Reports dropdown menu, and select Replicates from the Reports list.\n54. Define the standard raw files as Sample Type Standard, and specify their Analyte Concentrations. Select Unknown for sample raw files.\n55. To view the calibration curve, go to the View menu, and select Calibration Curve.\n56. Access Reports from the Document Grid, and select Peptide Quantification. Prepare a report in the Export tab, enter the file name, and click OK.\n57. Normalize raw quantifications for each sample using the total protein amount used for in-gel digestion."
