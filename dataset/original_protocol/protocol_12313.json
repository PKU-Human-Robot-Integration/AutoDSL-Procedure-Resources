    "All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with UK Home Office Regulations as specified in the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act (1986) under Project Licence number 60/4435. To collect embryos at specific developmental stages, timed matings were set up O/N. Noon on the day of finding a vaginal plug was designated embryonic day (E) 0.5.\n1. Dissecting the E7.5 or E8.5 Postimplantation Embryos for Ex Vivo Culture\nSacrifice the pregnant female mice by cervical dislocation.\nIsolate the uterus using scissors, holding it with forceps, and place in a 30 mm dish filled with M2 medium.\nCarefully tear apart the myometrium using two pairs of fine forceps.\nPeel away the decidua, being careful not to puncture the extraembryonic cavities.\nRemove the Reichert’s membrane by pinching it with forceps and slowly separating it from the embryo.\nCheck the embryos under a dissecting stereomicroscope to ensure that the yolk sac, amnion and ectoplacental cone are intact.\nTransfer the embryos to a clean dish of M2 using a pipette and place on a 30 mm plastic Petri dish lid on ice (the ‘ice platform’) to partially chill embryos.\nIf required, store embryos in M2 on an ice platform for up to 1.5 hr, e.g., during media preparation or manipulation of small batches of ~3-4 embryos at RT.\n\tNote: Recovery and dissection of rodent embryos has been described in detail previously7,8,16.\n2. Prepare the Embryo Culture Medium\nFreshly thaw either commercially-available rat serum (see Glanville-Jones et al.13 for specifications), or rat serum prepared in-house according to Copp and Cockroft16 that was heat inactivated for 30 min at 56 ˚C and frozen in 1 ml aliquots at -80 ˚C",
    "Note: Commercially-available rat serum is acceptable for culture periods of 24-36 hr, although serum prepared in-house is, in our experience, superior for culture periods up to 48 hr.\nFreshly prepare an excess (e.g., 10 ml) of defined supplements consisting of Glasgow Minimum Essential Medium (GMEM), 1% Non-Essential Amino Acids (NEAA), 2 mM L-glutamine and 1 mM sodium pyruvate.\nCalculate the volume of culture medium that is needed according to the number of embryos of each stage that are going to be cultured (see section 3). Mix the rat serum with the defined supplements to make up 50% culture medium (1:1 (v/v) rat serum:defined supplements) and/or 75% culture medium (3:1 (v/v) rat serum: defined supplements).\nPass the embryo culture medium through a 0.45 µm filter and add 10,000 I.U/ml penicillin and 10 µg/ml streptomycin.\n\tNote: Freshly thawed L-glutamine and sodium pyruvate solution is crucial for embryo development during ex vivo culture.\n3. Ex Vivo Culture Conditions for Different Embryonic Stages\nFor E7.5 embryos: static culture using 4-well plates in an incubator supplied with 5% CO2 in air at 37 ˚C for 24 hr. Culture up to two embryos per well in 1 ml of 50% culture medium.\nFor E8.5 embryos: use a roller culture apparatus8 rotating at 35 revs/min incorporating continuous gassing with 5% CO2 in air at 37 ˚C for 24 hr (1 ml of 50% culture medium per embryo).\nFor E9.5 embryos: use a roller culture apparatus rotating at 35 revs/min incorporating gases supplied with 5% CO2, 40% O2 55% N2 at 37 ˚C for 24 hr (1 ml of 75% culture medium per embryo).\n\tNote: Culture embryos within 3 hr after euthanizing the mice as prolonged periods in M2 adversely affect development. See Copp and Cockroft16 for the method of ex vivo embryo culture.",
    "4. Grafting Cultured Cells into E7.5 or E8.5 Mouse Embryos\nPhysically scrape EpiSCs, which ubiquitously express GFP, from a 6-well culture plate using a 20-200 µl pipette tip and place them in a 30 mm dish containing the embryos\n\tNote: To insert cell clumps in the embryos, cells should be physically scrapped rather than trypsinized.\nAttach a hand-pulled grafting capillary to the aspirator tube to make a mouth pipette.\nGently suck the mouth pipette to draw one or more cell clumps of size >20 cells into the grafting capillary.\nGently blow out the cells, to partially disperse large clumps.\nSelect one cell clump containing ~10-20 cells and suck into the grafting capillary again, keeping it close to the opening of the capillary. Be careful not to move the cell clump in and out of the capillary repeatedly, to avoid break-up into smaller pieces.\nHold the embryo loosely in place with a pair of forceps and insert the grafting capillary into the region of interest to create an opening.\nGently expel the clump out of the grafting capillary, leaving the short string of 10-20 cells lodged in the embryo.\nRepeat the grafting procedure for the desired number of embryos. Use batch sizes of 3-4 embryos for convenience.\nLeaving embryos in the same dish of M2 medium, image the grafted embryos using a fluorescence compound dissecting microscope with camera, keeping imaging time to a minimum to avoid exposure of the embryos to excessive light and heat.\n\tNote: Determine imaging times empirically as these will depend on the specifications of the camera and microscope, as well as the nature and fluorescence intensity of the fluorophore.\nTransfer the embryo in a pastette with a minimal volume of M2 medium to pre-equilibrated culture medium (see section 3) immediately after imaging.",
    "Note: Carefully examine the morphology of the embryos after grafting. Only culture the intact embryos.\n5. Handmade Electroporation Materials and Apparatus Setup (Prepare the Following in Advance of Electroporation Experiments):\nFor DNA injection pipettes: pull DNA injection pipettes using a horizontal micropipette puller. Injection pipettes should have a fine tip with an opening less than 10 µm to avoid tissue damage when injecting DNA into the embryonic cavities.\nFor glass capillary electroporation: use a microforge to cut the opening of DNA injection pipettes to an internal diameter of either 20 or 30 µm. To avoid cellular damage when the capillary is in contact with the embryo for electroporation, the tip of the glass capillary must be cut cleanly and not contain sharp, broken edges.\nFor handmade capillary electrode (anode) (Figure 1): insert a 0.2 mm diameter platinum wire into an electroporation glass capillary with a fixed opening of 20 or 30 µm diameter to focus the electric current and deliver the plasmid DNA to a small region of interest in the embryo.\nFor handmade L-shaped electrode (cathode) (Figure 1): bend a 0.2 mm diameter platinum wire creating an “L” shape, with the horizontal part of the “L” around 1 mm in length.\nAttach each platinum electrode to a thin insulated wire and insert it into a microinjection needle holder covered by insulation tape.\nMount the needle holders on standard micromanipulation instrument holders.\nConnect the circuit as shown in Figure 1: connect the capillary electrode to the anode of the power supply; connect the L-shaped electrode to the anode of the multimeter; connect the cathode of the mulimeter to the cathode of the power supply.\n6. Electroporation E7.5 or E8.5 Mouse Embryos",
    "Fill the electroporation glass capillary with PBS to within 1-2 mm of the top and insert the straight platinum electrode (anode) into the glass capillary until it reaches the bottom of the capillary.\nAnchor the L-shaped electrode (cathode) on the surface of a 30 mm petri dish filled with PBS.\nTransfer the embryo from M2 medium into the PBS-filled electroporation dish.\nInsert the injection needle from lateral epiblast into the amniotic cavity of the embryo. Using a pneumatic pico pump, inject DNA solution (pCAG-Cre:GFP or pCAG-GFP 1-1.5 µg/ml with 0.01% green food coloring dye) into the cavity until it is completely full. For E7.5-E8.5 embryos, less than 5 µl DNA solution is required for one embryo. Using the green dye as an indicator, be careful not to burst the embryo.\nCarefully position the embryo between the electrodes and move the capillary electrode to the precise location where the DNA is to be delivered.\n\tNote: The orientation of the embryo depends on the region where the DNA is to be electroporated.\nElectroporate the embryo using 200 volts (V) in 6 pulses, each of 50 ms duration with a 1 sec interval between each pulse.\nTransfer the embryo to pre-equilibrated culture medium immediately after electroporation. If desired, repeat the process for the next embryo.\n\tNote: Add the culture medium into a sterile container and put it in the culture incubator to pre-equilibrate the medium.\nTo detect electroporated cells 2 hr after culture, transfer the embryos to a clean 30 mm Petri dish of M2 medium using a pastette. Image the embryos as in step 5.9 using a fluorescence compound dissecting microscope.\nTransfer the embryos back to culture using a pastette immediately after imaging.",
    "To detect dead cells caused by electroporation, stain the embryos with a far-red cell membrane-impermeable nuclear dye (1:200 in embryo culture medium) at 37 ˚C for 10 min 2 hr after electroporation (Optional)\nTo count the electroporated cells, fix the embryos in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 2-4 hr at 4 ˚C, stain the nucleus with an ultraviolet or far-red fluorescent nuclear counterstain and image the embryos using a confocal microscope (Optional).\n\tNote: Embryonic growth is adversely affected if left too long in PBS. Therefore, ensure that the time taken to electroporate each embryo is minimized (<5 min per embryo)."
