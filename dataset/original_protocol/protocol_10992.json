    "See the Table of Materials for details of all materials, reagents, and instruments used in this protocol. Figure 1 shows the overall protocol for RNA FISH; Table 1 contains the composition of all solutions and Table 2 contains the primer sequences used in this protocol.\n1. Probe preparation\nIdentify and acquire the FASTA sequence of a target lncRNA of interest, for example, from GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/). Following the indications on the website, design the ISH probes online19, and review the design algorithm's suggestions to list the probes to be ordered with Cy3 label.\nIncubate the hybridization buffer at 37 °C for 2 h in advance.\nDissolve 4 optical density (OD) probe in 160 µL of diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated ddH2O at the concentration of 1 mg/mL away from light.\n\tNOTE: Optical density (OD) represents the measurement unit of DNA and RNA. Usually, 1 OD unit = 33 µg/mL DNA.\nPrepare 200 µL of the probe mixture for each well (1.2 µL-10 µL of probe, 70 µL of hybridization buffer, make up the volume with DEPC-treated ddH2O to 200 µL), and set up a series of 50 µg/mL, 25 µg/mL, 12.5 µg/mL, and 6 µg/mL.\n\tNOTE: The probe concentration needs to be explored experimentally in advance. A high probe concentration will lead to non-specific binding of lncRNAs, while a low probe concentration will lead to insensitive or failed detection of lncRNAs.\nDenature the probe mix at 73 °C for 5 min.\n\tNOTE: If the Cy3-labeled DNA probe is double-stranded, denature the probe to single-stranded DNA at 95 °C for 5 min, then quickly cool for 2 min on ice.\n2. Cell preparation\nSeed 50,000 143B cells per well on sterile glass coverslips in a 12-well cell culture plate and incubate them for 24 h (37 °C, 5% CO2) in DMEM.",
    "NOTE: The specific cell number seeded here varies with cell size, which is appropriate for the seeded cells to reach a confluence of 50% after being incubated for 24 h. The sterile glass coverslips are round to be suitable for the 12-well plate.\nRemove the medium and wash for 2 x 5 min with 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\n\tNOTE: Prepare 1x PBS with DEPC-treated ddH2O. PBS without DEPC-treatment cannot be used because it contains RNase. Perform all the following steps in RNase-free conditions.\nRemove 1x PBS and add 200 µL of 100% ethanol in each well to fix for 15 min at room temperature.\nRemove the ethanol, add 200 µL of 0.1% Triton X-100 (in 1x PBS) in each well, and incubate for 15 min at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: The time needs to be strictly controlled with Triton X-100 permeabilization and cannot be too long.\nRemove 0.1% Triton X-100 and wash 2 x 5 min with 1x PBS.\n\tNOTE: If the protocol has to be paused here, replace the PBS with 70% ethanol (dilution of 100% ethanol with RNase-free ddH2O) and store the sample at 4 °C for up to 3 months.\nRemove 1x PBS, add 200 µL of 2x sodium saline citrate (SSC) buffer (dilution of 20x SSC with RNase-free ddH2O) into each well, and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C.\nRemove 2x SSC buffer, add 200 µL of 70% ethanol into each well, and incubate for 3 min at room temperature.\nDiscard the 70% ethanol, add 200 µL of 85% ethanol (dilution of 100% ethanol with RNase-free ddH2O) into each well, and incubate for 3 min at room temperature.\nDiscard the 85% ethanol, add 200 µL of 100% ethanol into each well, and incubate for 3 min at room temperature.",
    "Absorb and discard 100% ethanol; let the wells dry.\n3. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)\nAdd 200 µL of probe mixture (denatured as in step 1.5) to each well and incubate at 37 °C overnight (16-18 h).\n\tNOTE: There is a strong positive correlation between hybridization temperature and probe concentration; therefore, to optimize the background, both the hybridization temperature and the probe concentration should be reduced.\nThe next day, take out samples from 37 °C and discard the probe mixture. Add 200 µL of 0.4x SSC/0.3% Tween-20 buffer to each well (preheated at 65 °C) and wash for 2 min at room temperature.\nRemove the 0.4x SSC/0.3% Tween-20 buffer, add 200 µL of 2x SSC/0.1% Tween-20 buffer to each well, and wash for 2 min at room temperature.\nRemove 2x SSC/0.1% Tween-20 buffer, add 200 µL of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining solution (1 µg/mL), and stain for 20 min away from light.\nDiscard the DAPI dye solution and wash with 1x PBS for 2 min at room temperature.\nAdd 50 µL of mounting medium containing gum onto the slide and place the glass coverslip on the slide to fix.\n\tNOTE: Be sure to place the coverslip on the slide with the cell side down.\nObserve under a fluorescence microscope.\n\tNOTE: Use a fluorescence microscope or a laser confocal microscope; the latter produces a higher sensitivity and clarity imaging.\nSubscription Required.
