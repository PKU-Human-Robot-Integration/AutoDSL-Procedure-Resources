    "A.  Construct mold (Pattern silicon wafer)Design mask: Our mask, (2D) negative of the mold shown in Figure 1A), is a simple array of straight channels, approximately 17 mm long and 1.5 mm wide with slightly larger circles at each end where the holes used for media/cell injection are punched.Center silicon wafer on spin coater and pour photoresist over center of wafer until approximately 2/3rds of the wafer is coated. The wafer may be exposed to oxygen plasma first to aid adhesion of the photoresist if desired. Spin two cycles, first at 500 rpm for 7 s with an acceleration of 100 rpm/s, and again at 2,000 rpm for 30 s with an acceleration of 300 rpm/s. This yields a post-exposure height of approximately 15 μm when using SU8-3000 photoresist and manufacturers’ recommendations.Bake (soft bake) on hotplate for approximately 40 min at 80 °C.Place mask on top of wafer and expose wafer to UV light (duration will depend on intensity of the light source).Wash wafer in developer, rinse (in IPA for SU8-3000), and dry.Note: With use, the features of the mold degrade. We store our molds in a cool, dry place but do not restrict exposure to air. Additional steps may be taken to slow feature degradation; however, regardless of the steps taken to protect the features of the mold, it is very likely the height will change over time. For this reason we suggest that beyond measuring the height of the mold initially after fabrication (via profilometer etc.), the height of the final PDMS channel itself is measured using confocal microscopy as described below. Additionally, it should be noted that the mold is likely to stick to PDMS during the first few uses and extra care should be taken with a new mold to maintain pattern integrity. B.",
    "Construct microfluidic chipThoroughly mix (stir manually for approximately 1 minute) a 10:1 ratio of PDMS (Sylgard 184) silicone elastomer:curing agent, vacuum degas, pour onto a mold, and cure in an oven at 80 °C for 45 min.Peel PDMS from the mold and cut devices into the desired dimensions. We typically arranged the channels so 2-4 independent channels could be bonded to a single substrate and imaged simultaneously.Create inlet and outlet ports for injecting cells/media.Note: This may be accomplished by simply punching holes using a blunt-tipped 21-gauge needle, McMaster Carr. Wash devices. We sonicate in 100% IPA for 15 min, rinse with water, and dry using a compressed air gun. We found the IPA wash to be particularly useful in clearing the channel of debris when compared to washing with water alone (Figure 1A).C.  Prepare substrateRinse glass substrate with water and dry. We use 50-mm glass-bottom Petri dishes (FlouroDish Cell Culture Dish; World Precision Instruments) which work well for coating with PDMS. If a PDMS coating is desired, to modify the stiffness of the substrate, place the glass dish on a spin-coater.For a 12.6 kPa coating, mix a 0.9:1 weight ratio of CY52-276A and CY52-276B.For a 3 kPa coating mix a 1:1 weight ratio of CY52-276A and CY52-276B. For a 0.4 kPa coating, mix a 1:1 weight ratio of QGel 920A and QGel 920B.Cover approximately 2/3rds of the glass with PDMS and spin. Duration and velocity of the spin coater will vary depending on the PDMS and glass substrate used. The goal of spin coating is to obtain an even, flat, and optically transparent layer.",
    "The final thickness of the coating needs only to be thin enough that it does not exceed the working distance of the objective used and thick enough that the bulk properties of the underlying glass do not impact the cell (i.e., the cell’s mechanical environment is equivalent to what it would be if placed on a bulk quantity of the coating).Expose the PDMS chip to oxygen plasma for approximately 1 min (time will vary by plasma source). This is done to change the surface of the PDMS from hydrophobic to hydrophilic and enables bonding with glass/PDMS. We find plasma treatment wrinkles the PDMS coating on the substrate and do not expose coated substrates to plasma prior to bonding. Uncoated, glass substrates, however, may be exposed to plasma in addition to the PDMS chips to aid bonding. Bake bonded devices in an oven at 80 °C for 45 min to ensure bonding (Figure 1B).D.  Seed devices with cells and imageExpose devices to oxygen plasma for 30 s. This is done to aid collagen/matrix protein deposition; however, as noted above, it can wrinkle PDMS coated substrates.Inject matrix protein solution and incubate. We use 50 μg/ml of type I rat-tail collagen (Corning) incubated for 1 h at 37 °C.Inject PBS to rinse.Prepare cell media. The cells may be seeded in either standard cell culture media (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic solution, 10,000 units/ml penicillin and 10,000 μg/ml streptomycin [P/S]) or media prepared for imaging which includes the dye, 0.1 μg/ml of Alexa Fluor 488 Dextran molecular weight 2,000 kD. If the dye is not included during the initial seeding, it must be introduced later which risks perturbing and potentially removing cells adhered to the channel.",
    "This may be required if long-duration, pre-imaging treatment is conducted after the cells have adhered which would otherwise remain incomplete by the time significant endocytosis occurs. Additionally, it may be noted that while increasing dye concentration increases the signal-to-noise ratio, high dye concentrations tend to photobleach rapidly. Lack of uniformity of this photobleaching may impact the volume calculation.Count cells and inject approximately 50 k cells per channel. This estimate requires knowing both the cell concentration in the injected media as well as the approximate volume of the channel.Immerse devices in cell culture media to prevent evaporation and incubate (at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 90% relative humidity) until cells are adhered. Imaging should be conducted as quickly as possible to avoid complications due to endocytosis. We usually completed imaging within 5h of seeding.For each region of interest (ROI), two images are taken–one DIC image and one epifluorescence image. Care must be taken in selection of the objective used. Objectives which focus light from a narrow vertical region (distance from the substrate) may not accurately report the total fluorescence emitted from the dye contained in the column of the channel specified by the ROI. Stated another way, the desired total fluorescence signal includes “out of focus” light. This tends to be problematic for higher magnification objectives and when this happens, the below calculation for channel and cell height will be inaccurate. We tested three Zeiss objectives with three different magnifications (63x oil, 0.8 NA; 20x air, 0.45 NA; and 10x air, 0.25 NA) and found that using a 20x air objective, our volume calculations were relatively insensitive to variability in focal plane indicating we are capturing the light emitted from the entire column specified by the ROI.",
    "We additionally find this magnification and numerical aperture (NA) to be sufficient for robust shape reconstruction (Figure 1C).Set up timelapse experiment if desired. Note that the imaging frequency may be limited by photobleaching or phototoxicity.At the completion of the experiment, we recommend capturing a quick-scan (a short pixel-dwell time is sufficient) confocal image at 1 μm interval z-stacks covering the entire depth of the channel at a few extreme ROIs. We typically select 4 ROI’s at the four “corners” of the channel. These stacks may be used to better measure the channel height of the PDMS channel itself which may differ from the original height of mold."
