    "Preparation of crude E. coli extracts containing YaiAE. coli BL21(DE) containing plasmid pCA31 (Mancini et al., 2015) was grown aerobically in 300 ml of LB broth containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin at 37 °C to an OD at 600 nm of 0.4. Then, 0.1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside was added, and growth was continued for 8 h at room temperature. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and pellets suspended in 20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), containing 1 mM 4-hydroxybenzoate to stabilize protein as described elsewhere (Moonen et al., 2008), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μg/ml of DNaseI. Cells were then broken by three passages through a French Press at 40 MPa, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 20 min at 90,000 x g. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 μm nitrocellulose filter and stored frozen at -20 °C until used. YaiA Activity assay by spectrophotometryMix 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10% (v/v) glycerol with 1 mg of crude extract in a total volume of 990 µl and warm to 30 °C in the spectrophotometer. This temperature was chosen since the origin of YaiA is L. lactis, which grows best at 30 °C.Zero the spectrophotometer and record the baseline spectrum from 300 to 400 nm. Start the reaction by adding 10 µl of 100 mM hydroquinone (final concentration 1 mM) and record spectra every 5 to 15 min, depending on the rate of the reaction. Calculate the specific activity from the increase in absorption at 320 nm, using an extinction coefficient for 4-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde of 11,000 M-1 cm-1 (Moonen et al., 2008; Spain and Gibson, 1991). Running spectra rather than measuring absorption at 320 nm is important to assured that the desired reaction is measured in the crude extracts.",
    "This should be further validated by calculating difference spectra (see Figure 1 and Note 1).Enzyme kineticsTo determine the Km for hydroquinone, run enzyme reactions with 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300 and 1,000 µM hydroquinone. Determine the initial reaction rate, v0, for each reaction. If the reaction is linear, v0 is the slope of the linear regression of the data (e.g. calculated with the corresponding function built into Excel). If the reaction curve is sigmoidal, only the initial (highest) slope should be considered. Plot v0 versus the substrate concentrations, S.  Fit the curve to obtain the affinity for the substrate, Km, and the maximal velocity, vmax. Alternatively, plot v0 versus 1/S to obtain a Lineweaver-Burk plot. The regression line intercepts the ordinate at 1/vmax and the abscissa at -1/Km.YaiA activity assay by measuring oxygen consumptionIn a 1 ml chamber fitted with a Clark oxygen electrode or in any commercial oxygraph chamber, thermostated to 30 °C, mix 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10% (v/v) glycerol, with 1 mg of crude extract.When a constant rate of oxygen consumption is attained (basal oxygen consumption due to other enzyme activities), inject 10 µl of 100 mM hydroquinone into the chamber and continue to record the oxygen consumption.Subtract the basal oxygen consumption from the rate observed with hydroquinone. Calculate the specific activity by calculating the oxygen consumption, based on the chamber volume and the oxygen content of the buffer, which can be taken from Estabrook (1967) or, if high precision is required calculated as described by Rasmussen and Rasmussen (2003). Under our conditions, buffer at 30 °C contains 222 µM O2.Enzyme kineticsTo determine the Km for hydroquinone, run enzyme reactions with 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300 and 1,000 µM quinone.",
