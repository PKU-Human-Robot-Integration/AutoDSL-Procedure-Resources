    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nFluro-Jade C staining of degenerated neurons\nTiming: 2–3 h\nRationale: Fluro-Jade C staining is able to stain all degenerating neurons, regardless of specific insult or mechanism of cell death. It is ideal for localizing not only degenerating nerve cell bodies, but also distal dendrites, axons and terminals, due to greatest signal to background ratio, as well as the highest resolution. Sections labeled with FJC can also be immuno-stained to achieve multiplexed labeling.\nPre-treating free-floating brain sections\nWash free-floating brain sections with 1× PBS 5 times, 5 min for each time, to remove anti-freezing solution completely.\nPre-treat sections as indicated below:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1129_7.csv\nNote: Pre-treating should be performed in the wells of a 24- or 12-well cell culture plate for free-floating brain sections. Brain sections will shrink in 0.06% potassium permanganate solution and expand in ddH2O, but will recover to normal shape in PBS. Keep staining regardless of shape change of the brain sections.\nPerforming FJC staining\nDilute DAPI stock solution (0.1 mg/mL) in 0.0001% FJC working solution at a ratio of 1:1000.\nStain brain sections with 0.0001% FJC working solution containing DAPI dye for 20 min.\nWash brain sections with ddH2O for 3 times to remove extra FJC solution.\nRecover brain sections in 1× PBS.\nPause point: Sections can be stored in 1× PBS for 0.5–1 h before mounting.\nMount brain sections on slides with Fluorescence Mounting Medium.\nPut cover glass on the slides and push off bubbles and remove extra mounting medium.\nDry the mounted slides in the dark overnight (12–14 h) at room temperature.\nNote: This protocol refers to a wet mount media, and nail polish should be used to seal coverslips. The mounted slides can be stored at 4°C for 1 month before imaging.\nQuantification of degenerated neurons",
    "Take pictures of degenerated neurons in cortex and hippocampus using an Olympus BX51 microscope with 20× objective lens (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Use filter cube WU-#1 (dichroic mirror DM400, excitation filter BP330-385, barrier filter BA420) to visualize DAPI, and use filter cube WB - #2 (dichroic mirror DM500, excitation filter BP450-480, barrier filter BA515) to visualize FJC. For each mouse brain sample, three to five serial sections should be stained, and entire brain region should be pictured for quantification.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1129-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Degenerated neurons detected by FJC staining in aged 5XFAD mice\nRepresentative pictures of degenerated neurons labeled by FJC in cortex and hippocampus of 9-month-old WT and 5XFAD mice. Scale bar, 200 μm.\nOpen pictures with Fiji-ImageJ software, and use modules of “Measure” and “Analyze Particles” to calculate the density of degenerated neurons by measuring the brain area and counting the number of degenerated neurons respectively.\nStatistically analyze the density (the number of FJC-positive neurons in given brain area (mm2) ) of degenerated neurons among several groups using GraphPad Prism 6 software.\nImmunofluorescent staining of apoptotic neurons\nTiming: 2 days\nRationale: Apoptotic cells have the feature of enhanced activation of caspase-3, which is a specific executioner caspase in apoptosis. Anti-NeuN and anti-cleaved caspase-3 double staining is able to detect apoptosis specifically in neurons.\nWash brain sections with 1× PBS for 3 times, 10 min for each time, to thoroughly remove anti-freezing solution.\nPermeabilize sections in 0.3% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS for 30 min.\nIncubate sections in blocking buffer (5% normal donkey serum and 1% BSA in 1× PBS) for 1 h at room temperature.\nPrepare primary antibody dilutions of anti-cleaved caspase-3 (1:100) and anti-NeuN (1:500) with blocking buffer.\nIncubate sections in primary antibodies overnight (12–14 h) on an orbital shaker at a speed of 50 rpm at 4°C.",
    "Next day, wash sections with PBST washing buffer for 3 times, 10 min for each time.\nPrepare secondary antibody solutions of donkey anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor® 594 (1:1000) and donkey anti-guinea pig Alexa Fluor® 488 (1:1000), or fluorophores of your choice, with blocking buffer.\nIncubate sections with secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature to visualize primary antibodies.\nWash sections with PBST for 3 times, 10 min for each time.\nIncubate sections with 100 ng/mL DAPI solution to stain cell nuclei.\nMount brain sections on slides with Fluorescence Mounting Medium.\nPut cover glass on the slides and push off bubbles and remove extra mounting medium.\nDry the mounted slides in the dark overnight (12–14 h) at room temperature.\nNote: This protocol refers to a wet mount media, and nail polish should be used to seal coverslips. The mounted slides can be stored at 4°C for 1 month before imaging.\nImage cleaved caspase-3 positive neurons using a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Typically, three to five serial sections per mice, and four to six fields per section need to be randomly pictured for quantification. 40X or 63X objective lens is recommended for imaging. Excitation and emission filters are used based on the fluorophores of your choice.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1129-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Neuronal apoptosis in aged 5XFAD mice\nRepresentative pictures of apoptotic neurons detected by cleaved caspase-3 and NeuN double staining in the cortex of 9-month-old WT and 5XFAD mice. Scale bar, 50 μm.\nStatistically analyze the ratio of apoptotic neurons (number of apoptotic neurons/number of total neurons) among several groups using GraphPad Prism 6 software.",
    "Critical: The species of normal serum used for blocking buffer should be consistent with the species of your secondary antibodies. If you use goat anti-rabbit IgG and goat anti-guinea pig IgG secondary antibodies, you should use goat normal serum for blocking.\nNissl staining for neuronal density analysis\nTiming: 4–5 h\nRationale: Cresyl violet acetate solution is able to stain Nissl substance in the cytoplasm of neurons. Nissl granules are purple, nuclei of glial cells and endothelial cells are slightly bluer than Nissl granules. Thus, the neuronal density in brain section can be measured by Nissl staining using Cresyl violet acetate.\nWash brain sections with 1× PBS for 3 times, 10 min for each time, to thoroughly remove anti-freezing solution.\nMount sections on gelatin-coated slides and allow them to dry at least for 1 h at room temperature.\nPerform Nissl staining as shown below:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1129_8.csv\nMount brain sections on slides with neutral balsam.\nPut cover glass on the slides and push off bubbles and remove extra neutral balsam.\nTake pictures of brain sections using Olympus BX51 microscope under bright-field with 20X objective lens (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). For each mouse brain sample, three to five serial sections should be stained, and entire brain region should be pictured for quantification.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1129-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Neuronal loss in cortical layer 5 and subiculum of aged 5XFAD mice\nRepresentative pictures of Nissl staining in the cortex and subiculum of 9-month-old WT and 5XFAD mice. Scale bar, 200 μm.\nOpen pictures with Fiji-ImageJ software, and use modules of “Measure” and “Analyze Particles” to calculate the neuronal density by measuring the brain area and counting the number of total neurons respectively.\nStatistically analyze the neuronal density in given brain area (cells/mm2) among several groups using GraphPad Prism 6 software.",
    "Critical: Aged 5XFAD mice display significant neuronal loss in cortical layer 5 and subiculum of hippocampus according to literature (Oakley et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). However, significant neuronal loss can also be detected in the dentate gyrus of hippocampus in 9-month-old 5XFAD mice (Zhang et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). But the neuronal loss in dentate gyrus is hard to be analyzed via Nissl staining method due to compact localization of hippocampal neurons in dentate gyrus. Thus, we recommend to measure neuronal density in dentate gyrus using immunofluorescent staining with anti-NeuN antibody, combining with confocal imaging (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1129-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.
