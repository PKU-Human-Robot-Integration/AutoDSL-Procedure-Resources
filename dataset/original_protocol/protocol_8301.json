Similar results can be observed when by Aβ1-42 treatment for 1 h after 3 days of neuronal culture31.\nRemove the culture medium and immediately fix the neurons with 4% paraformaldehyde containing 4% sucrose in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C on a hot plate.\nAfter fixation, wash the neurons 3 times with PBS and mount them with an aqueous mounting medium. Dry the mounting medium at 4 °C for 2–4 days.\nCapture the entire area (7.8 x 9 mm2) of each well with a 20X dry objective lens on an inverted microscope.\nClassify the longest neurites of each neuron in stage 3 or 4 as axons, as previously described32,33.",
    "Classify growth cones according to the following criteria: 1) axonal growth cones lacking lamellipodia or 2) possessing fewer than three filopodia are considered collapsed growth cones, as described previously17.\n\t\tNOTE: Healthy growth cones are scored as 0 point; collapsed growth cones are scored as 1 point. Mean collapse scores are calculated for each treatment.\n2. Amyloid β Immunostaining\nCulture mouse cortical neurons for 3 days, as described in step 1.2.\nTreat with aggregated Aβ1-42 (5 μM) or vehicle for 4 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator.\nWithout removing the medium, add an equal volume of 4% paraformaldehyde containing 4% sucrose in PBS to each well, and maintain the culture at 37 °C on a hot plate for 5 min.\nReplace the solution with 400 μL of 4% paraformaldehyde containing 4% sucrose in PBS, and maintain at 37 °C on the hot plate for 1 h. This fixation protocol was modified from a previous report34.\nWash the neurons 3 times with PBS.\nBlock with 5% normal goat serum in PBS.\nIncubate the neurons with mouse anti-amyloid β immunoglobulin G (IgG) (1:50) and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS at 4 °C overnight.\nWash the neurons 3 times with PBS.\nIncubate the neurons with a fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody (1:400) and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS at room temperature for 2 h.\nWash the neurons 3 times with PBS and mount them with an aqueous mounting medium.\nCapture fluorescence images and bright field images with oblique illumination by using a 40X dry objective lens on inverted microscope B.\n3.

Commercially available glass-based dishes can also be used for live imaging. Homemade glass-based dishes were prepared as follows: 1) make a hole approximately 1.4 mm in diameter in the center of a 35-mm dish with a hand punch, and 2) attach a glass coverslip (diameter of 22 mm) to the back of the dish with silicone.\nWash the plates with distilled water, as described in step 1.1.2, and culture the cortical neurons in the glass-based dish at 3 x 104 cells/dish with medium A, as described in step 1.2.\nAfter 4 days of cell culture, replace the medium with 2 mL of new medium B, and transfer the dish to inverted microscope A.
