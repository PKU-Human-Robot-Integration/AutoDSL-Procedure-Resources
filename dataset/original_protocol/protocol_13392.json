    "All the animal procedures conformed to the Association for Research on Vision and Ophthalmology's statement on the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Wenzhou Medical University (WMU). The rats and mice were given free access to water and food with an environmental light intensity of 18 lux on a 12 h dark/light cycle.\n1. Preparation of the ocular animal models\nMouse laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) model11,12\nAnesthetize 4-week-old female mice (C57BL/6J background) with ketamine and xylazine, and dilate the pupils with tropicamide phenylephrine eye drops following step 3.2. Consider the mouse properly anesthetized when no movement is detected after pinching the toe.\nEngage the light-source box, the software, and the laser box (wavelength: 532 nm), with the output energy adjusted to 100 mW and the duration to 100 ms.\nPlace the mouse on the experimental platform and adjust the position of the mouse and the platform until the view of the mouse fundus is clear.\nPress the Laser ON button on the screen of the laser box and adjust the focus of the red laser reference spot. Move the laser reference spot and adjust it to one to two papillary diameters away from the optic disc. Operate the foot pedal to cause laser damage.\nConduct an immediate check to determine whether a vaporizing bubble occurred immediately after the hit, which is a sign of successful laser damage. Generate three to five laser spots for each eye.\nMouse optic nerve crush (ONC) model13,14,15,16\nAnesthetize female mice (C57BL/6J background) at postnatal day (P) 21 to P35 following step 3.2. Consider the mouse properly anesthetized when no movement is detected after pinching the toe.",
    "Place the mouse under a surgical microscope, and incise the conjunctiva of one eye using spring scissors, ensuring the size of the conjunctiva incision is approximately 1 mm.\nExpose the intraorbital optic nerve, and crush with fine forceps for 5 s at 0.5 mm away from the optic disc. While doing this, gently deflect the orbital muscles and the other tissues, and place them aside. Avoid damage to any blood vessels in the surgical eye.\n\t\tNOTE: Be careful, as the eyeball will swing when touching or plucking the white bunchy optic nerve.\nApply ophthalmic ointment postoperatively to avoid corneal dryness.\nMouse light-induced retinal degeneration (LIRD) model17,18,19,20,21\nPreparations before the experiment: Enclose the mouse cages (30 cm x 18 cm x 13 cm) with aluminum foil and an iron mesh cover. Place each cage in a paper box (52 cm x 35 cm x 30 cm) with a white light on the top.\nDark-adapt 6-week-old male mice (BALB/c) overnight in the dark room, and then dilate the eyes using tropicamide phenylephrine eye drops in each eye. Fully dilate the pupil until 3/4 of the cornea area is not covered by the iris; this often takes no more than 3 min.\nIlluminate the mice with 10,000 lux white light for 2 h. Keep the mice in the dark overnight postoperatively, and then return to normal dark-light environments. To ensure an effective light stimulus, keep one mouse in the cage at all times.\nRat experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) model\n\t\nPreparations before the experiment: Emulsify 2.5 mg of hIRBP161-180 in complete Freund's adjuvant (1:1 weight/volume) with 2.5 mg/mL Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra22,23.\nInject 100 µL of emulsion subcutaneously into the left footpad of each Lewis male rat (about 180 g).\n2. OCT module setup",
    "Connect the optical fiber and the OCT control cable between the OCT scan head and the OCT engine (Figure 1A). Align the notch on the fiber with a slot on the connector, and gently insert the tip until it is seated (Figure 1B).\n\tNOTE: Before connecting the control cable, turn the power switch of the OCT engine OFF. The optical fiber is very fragile, so avoid both ends of the fiber tip (Figure 1C). Assembling and disassembling the OCT scan head and the fiber/cable should be avoided if this module is under frequent use.\nThread the mouse or rat OCT objective lens to the front of the machine body (Figure 1A). Place the OCT scan head onto the OCT lens, with the M-R focus indicator facing away from the machine body (Figure 1A).\nSecure the OCT scan head with two thumbscrews: one on the lens and one on the camera body. Fix the scan head tightly.\nTurn on the main power switch, followed by the camera light, and then the OCT software.\n\t​NOTE: The camera needs some time to boot up for the computer to find it.\n3. Animal preparation for OCT experiments\nAt 10 min before the OCT experiments, instill tropicamide phenylephrine eye drops in the animal's eyes, and wipe away excess eye drops using a clean towel.\nAt 5 min before the experiment, inject 200 µL of the anesthetic solution into the mouse, and inject 2.0 mL into the rat intraperitoneally. Consider the mouse/rat properly anesthetized when no movement is detected after pinching the toe.",
    "NOTE: The anesthetic solutions were composed of ketamine (12 mg/mL) and xylazine (1 mg/mL for the mouse and 2 mg/mL for the rat) in saline; typically, 10 µL of anesthetic solution per 1 g of animal body mass is applied. The solutions were stored at 4 °C for a maximum of 2 weeks.\nOnce anesthesia is administered, lubricate the cornea with gel ointment to avoid ocular surface dryness.\n4. Image-guided OCT Imaging\nNOTE: The software interface was divided into three parts: brightfield image, OCT control tabs, and OCT display (Figure 2).\nWhen looking at the brightfield image, type the annotation of the animal information if needed.\nToggle the Beam Position Controls ON or OFF using the check box to capture a brightfield image with or without the line overlay on the image.\nTo place the scanning beam more precisely, use the Position Nudge arrows for fine control to direct it up, down, left, or right. Choose the thickness values and color, and choose an angle for the beam targeting the location of interest (e.g., thick, black, and 0). Drag the gain value to 14 db.\nGo to the OCT control tabs. From the menu, select File/File_Settings, and then create a path to where the OCT and fundus images will be saved.\nSpecify the scan type, size, and animal (rat or mouse); choose Eye, left or right, and Imaging Retina.\n\tNOTE: OCT can capture line, circle, and 3D volume scan types at full, half, quarter, and eighth sizes.\nSet the image controls. Adjust the values: 60 for the contrast, 100 for the gamma , and 0 for the brightness.",
    "Place the mouse on the experimental platform and adjust the position of the mouse and platform until the view of the mouse fundus is clear. Finely adjust the position to localize the optic disc in the center.\nAdjust the reference arm to 850 for mice and 830 for rats at the beginning, and then finely adjust the position by clicking the <-1 or +1> buttons. Adjust the OCT image horizontally, and then move the OCT image to the top 1/3 of the full view.\nMove the polarization slider to adjust the brightness of the signal through the retina, if needed.\nAfter observing a clear and stable OCT image as well as the fundus image, set the number of frames (usually 20, 50, 80, or 100), and then press Average.\n\tNOTE: It takes several seconds to capture the OCT images. A larger number of frames means the image capture takes longer to finish but produces a higher-quality captured image.\nPress Save to save the OCT and fundus images, and then click Restart to capture another sample.\n\t​NOTE: The animals were allowed to recover on a 37 °C heating plate before awakening. The animals were not left unattended until they had regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. The animals that had undergone treatment were not returned to the raising system of other animals until fully recovered.\n5. Thickness measurement and quantitative analysis\nNOTE: This OCT has built-in analysis software. OCT images can be segmented and analyzed using this software (Figure 3).\nOpen the analysis software and open an OCT image that needs to be analyzed.\nChoose the number of layers, and then press Get Initial Layers (Figure 3A). The software will draw the layers automatically.",
    "Click the Pencil icon, and then move the dots on the target layer to finely adjust the layer (Figure 3A, B). Modify all the layers carefully one by one.\n\tNOTE: Adding more layers is doable. Click on the Plus icon, draw several dots over the OCT image, and then press the Tick icon. A new layer will be created.\nOnce fine adjustments of the layers are completed, export the detailed values (CSV format) and different image types of the segmented OCT (Figure 3A).\n\tNOTE: It is possible to export different image types, including layers, thickness, thickness map, layers without OCT, and screen grabs. The value in the middle that overlaps with the optic nerve of every image needs to be abandoned and set as zero since there is no retinal layer there.\nSubscription Required.
