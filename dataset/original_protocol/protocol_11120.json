    "This study was approved by the Medical Institutional Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University (No. XJTUIAF2018LSK-139). Informed consent was obtained from all enrolled patients.\n1. Criteria for entering the cancer group and the control group\nFor the cancer group, enroll patients who are primarily diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and after laparotomy, they are proven to have serous ovarian cancer by pathological findings.\nFor the control group, enroll patients that are primarily diagnosed with uterine myoma or uterine adenomyosis, without presenting any ovarian condition, and who have undergone hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy.\n\tNOTE: This standard is not definite. Patients with diseases not affecting the ovaries who undergo hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy can also be enrolled.\nExclude patients with one or more of the following criteria:\n\tPregnant or breast-feeding women.\n\tTaking antibiotics 2 months prior to the surgery.\n\tHaving fever or elevated inflammatory markers.\n\tHaving inflammation of any kind.\n\tHaving undergone neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\n2. Gather samples\nDuring the surgery, place the resected ovaries into a sterile tube and place the tube in liquid nitrogen for transport. Avoid touching anything else throughout the whole procedure.\nSeparate the ovaries into approximately 1-cm thick tissue samples with a pair of new sterile tweezers under a laminar flow cabinet. After separation, preserve samples at -80 °C.\n\t​NOTE: All the procedures for gathering samples are aseptic, including separating the ovaries.\n3. Sequence the 16S rRNA gene\nExtract DNA.\n\t\nAdd 1.2 mL of inhibit EX buffer into a 2 mL centrifuge tube. Then, add 180-220 mg of samples into the tube. Let the sample fully mix (70 °C water bath for 5 min and then vortex for 15 s).\nCentrifuge the tube for 1 min at 600 x g.",
    "Place 550 µL of the supernatant into a new 1.5 mL tube, and centrifuge for 1 min at 600 x g.\nTransfer 400 µL of the supernatant with 30 µL of proteinase K into another 1.5 mL tube.\nAdd 400 µL of buffer AL and use a vortex mixer for 15 s.\nIncubate at 70 °C for 10 min.\nAdd 400 µL of 96-100% alcohol. Use a vortex mixer for 15 s.\nTransfer 600 µL of mixture into an absorption column and centrifuge for 1 min at 13700 g. Exchange the lower tube. Repeat this step 11 times.\nAdd 500 µL of buffer AW1, centrifuge for 1 min at 13,700 x g, and change the lower tube.\nAdd 500 µL of buffer AW2, centrifuge for 3 min at 13,700 x g, and change the lower tube.\nCentrifuge for 3 min at 13,700 x g.\nTransfer the mixture into a new 1.5 mL tube, add 200 µL of buffer ATE, incubate at room temperature for 5 min and centrifuge for 1 min at 13,700 x g.\nQuality testing. Use 1% Sepharose gel electrophoresis to test the quality. Add 400 ng of sample, 120 V, 30 mins. Ideal result: DNA concentration: ≥ 10 ng/µL, DNA purity: A260/A280 = 1.8-2.0, gross DNA: ≥ 300 ng.\nPrepare the libraries using a 16S metagenomic sequencing kit according to the manufacturer's protocol.\n\t\nPerform PCR. Briefly, each 25 µL PCR reaction contains 12.5 ng of sample DNA as input, 12.5 µL of 2x KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix and 5 µL of each primer at 1 µM.",
    "Carry out PCR using the following protocol: an initial denaturation step performed at 95°C for 3 min followed by 25 cycles of denaturation (95°C, 30 s), annealing (55°C, 30 s) and extension (72°C, 30 s), and a final elongation of 5 min at 72°C.\nClean up the PCR product from the reaction mix with magnetic beads using the manufacturer's instructions.\nRepeat steps 3.3.1 and 3.3.2.\nQuality testing. Please refer to step 3.2.\nRepeat step 3.3.3.\nQuality testing. Use 1% Sepharose gel electrophoresis to test impurity, a spectrophotometer to test purity, a fluorometer to test the concentration, and an RNA assay kit to test integrity. Follow the manufacturer's protocol. Normalize and pool the libraries; then sequence (2 x 300 bp paired-end read setting) using 600 cycle V3 standard flow cells, producing approximately 100,000 paired-end 2 x 300 base reads.\n\t\t​NOTE: The full-length primer sequences: 16S Amplicon polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Forward primer: 5' TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGA GACAG-[CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG] and 16S Amplicon PCR Reverse primer: 5' GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG-[GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC].\n4.
