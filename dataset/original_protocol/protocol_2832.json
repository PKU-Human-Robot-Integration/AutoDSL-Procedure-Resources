    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTumor generation in genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of glioma\nTiming: 2 h (30 min for plasmids mix and 1.5 h for a cage of 5 mice)\nThe Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system was used to generate a GEMM of glioma by inducing genetic modifications into the neural precursor cells of the subventricular zone in neonatal pups. This method was used as previously described.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3],4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nAnesthetize one-day-old C57BL/6 mouse pups via hypothermia for 2 min.\nPlace them in a stereotaxic apparatus to orthotopically inject the plasmid combination encoding the desired genetic modifications into the subventricular zone to induce tumorigenesis.\nDelivery of plasmids is achieved with in vivo DNA transfection agent jetPEI®.\nNote: The genetic alterations include: RTK/RAS/PI3K overactivation (NRAS-G12V), p53 knockdown, and ATRX knockdown for the NPA model, and RTK/RAS/PI3K overactivation (NRAS-G12V), p53 knockdown, and PDGFβ ligand overexpression for NPD model. The chosen genetic models include the use of the following plasmids: (1) pT2C-LucPGK-SB100×, (2) pT2-NRAS-G12V; (3) pT2-shP53-GFP4; (4) pT2-shAtrx-GFP4; (5) pT2-shP53-Pdgfβ-GFP4.\nTo evaluate the evolution of the tumor in vivo, each week, use IVIS® Spectrum imaging system to measure bioluminescence.\nNote: Tumors generated with the SB system can be initially detected 30–40 days post injection, for NPA model, and 20–30 days post injection, for NPD model.\nBefore an animal’s tumor burden reaches the humane endpoint, as defined by the IACUC, or when obtaining an IVIS signal of 106 to 107 photon/seconds, the animal should be euthanized and its brain removed.\nCritical: Tumor burden is assessed with behavioral monitoring (hunched posture, scruffy fur, lack of ambulation, and/or periocular porphyrin staining). For time lapse scanning imaging, GEMM tumors should reach the moribund stage. Consistent weekly imaging using IVIS is crucial.",
    "Critical: Explants obtained from mice in the latest stage will exhibit tumor necrosis and will not display cell migration and proliferation.\nFor brain acquisition proceed to step (15).\nUse an epifluorescent stereomicroscope to confirm the presence of a tumor before proceeding to the next step.\nNote: Tumors generated with the SB system can be dissected using an inflorescent stereomicroscope and dissociated to generate glioma neurospheres which are maintained through culture and used for further orthotopic implantation.\nTumor initiation via orthotopic implantation of glioma neurospheres\nTiming: 30 min per animal implanted\nIntracranial orthotopic implantation of glioma neurospheres obtained from the above mentioned GEMM was performed as previously described.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nDissociate the cultured neurospheres with StemPro Accutase and resuspend them in DMEM F-12 without FBS or supplements, to a final concentration of 50,000 cells/μL.\nUse 6–8 –week-old C57BL/6 mice or ROSAmT/mG mice for orthotopic intracranial stereotactic implantation.\nNote: ROSAmT/mG mice express TdTomato protein in all cells. This characteristic enables the visualization of GFP+ tumor cells migrating into the normal brain parenchyma.\nAfter anesthetizing the mice with a 100 μL intraperitoneal injection of ketamine at 120 mg/kg and dexmedetomidine at 0.5 mg/kg, give them preemptive analgesia by a 100 μL subcutaneous injection of carprofen at 5 mg/kg and shave their heads before securing them in a stereotaxic apparatus.\nRetract the scalp and drill a burr hole 1 mm anterior and 1.5 mm lateral relative to bregma.\nInject 50,000 NPA or NPD cells suspended in 1 μL of DMEM F-12 without FBS or supplements into a pocket spanning 3 mm–3.5 mm deep in the striatum.",
    "Use bone wax and sutures to seal the skull and scalp, respectively, before reversing the anesthesia with a 100 μL intraperitoneal injection of atipamezole at 1.0 mg/kg and additional analgesia with a 100 μL subcutaneous injection of buprenorphine at 0.1 mg/kg.\nObserve the mice until they are bright, alert, and responsive before returning them to normal housing. Usual recovery time is 30 min.\nBefore animal tumor burden reaches the humane endpoint, as defined by the IACUC, or when obtaining an IVIS signal of 106 to 107 photon/second, the animal should be to be euthanized and its brain removed.\nCritical: Tumor burden is assessed with behavioral monitoring (hunched posture, scruffy fur, lack of ambulation, and/or periocular porphyrin staining). For time lapse-imaging, mice should nearly reach the moribund stage. Consistent weekly imaging using IVIS is crucial. Explants from mice euthanized too late will exhibit tumors with necrosis and will not display cell migration and proliferation.\nPreparation prior to sample acquisition\nTiming: 1 h\nPreparation of cell culture inserts, media for tissue collection and agarose for tissue embedding.\nHuman: At least 1 h before procuring the patient-derived tumor samples, pipet 100 μL of the Matrigel® solution (1 volume of Matrigel® mixed with 2 volumes of cell culture media) onto cell culture inserts and incubate for 1 h. After that, add 1 mL of Secondary mouse culture medium to avoid desiccation of the Matrigel®.\nNote: To use the patient-derived tumor explants as a high-throughput platform for drug screening, tissue can be placed on 24- to 96-well-plate inserts.\nMouse: At least 1 h before procuring the mouse samples, pipet 1,000 μL of the laminin coating solution onto cell culture inserts in a six well plate and incubate for 1 h.",
    "Melt the 4% (m/v) agarose in the microwave until it has begun to boil and becomes a transparent liquid, approximately 30 s.\nCritical: If using a container with a cap or lid, make sure to loosen it so the container does not build up pressure while heating to prevent container breakage and injury.\nCritical: The lid cannot be removed, only loosened, to maintain the sterility achieved by boiling the agarose.\nPlace the melted 4% (m/v) agarose in the 40°C water bath to prevent solidification.\nPipet 50 mL of human culture medium into a 50 mL conical tube and warm it to 37°C.\nIn the laminar flow hood, place the container of sectioning medium in the ice bucket. Using plastic tubing and a sterile 10 mL pipette, oxygenate the medium with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 gas for at least 20 min.\nPrepare 30 mL of the cold, oxygenated human culture medium into a 50 mL conical tube for sample collection. Place tube in an ice bucket until collection.\nDissection and acquisition of mouse brain\nTiming: 20 min per mouse\nThe following steps describe how to perform the dissection and acquisition of a mouse brain post tumor intracranial orthotopic surgery or a GEMM.\nAs indicated previously, select a mouse post intracranial orthotopic surgical implantation or a GEMM of glioma mouse with an IVIS signal between 106 to 107 photon/sec.\nPut the mouse under anesthesia via inhalation using Fluriso™.\nPlace the mouse in the gas anesthesia system anesthesia chamber and turn the 100% oxygen tank on to between 345 and 448 kPa.\nAdjust the airflow to the anesthesia chamber to 1.5 L per minute.\nSet the anesthesia vaporizer to 0.25%.\nWait 1–2 min for the mouse to lose consciousness.\nTurn off the oxygen, airflow, and vaporizer before removing the mouse.",
    "Mouse brain resection.\nPlace the mouse on a sterile surface in the biological safety cabinet.\nSpray the head and neck of the mouse with 70% ethanol to wet the fur.\nEuthanize the mouse via decapitation with the large surgical scissors.\nCritical: Minimize time between euthanasia and vibrosectioning to prevent cell death. Place the head in a 10 cm Petri dish, covered, and transport it on ice to the laminar flow hood.\nWith the large surgical scissors, open the scalp, moving rostral to caudal.\nDissect the brain using rongeurs.\nCritical: Only squeeze until separation of the frontal bones is observed upon breaking the interfrontal suture. Squeezing too much will damage the brain.\nWith the rongeurs, remove any muscle and cervical vertebrae from the caudal side of the head. Begin removing the bones of the skull from rostral to caudal.\nOnce the dorsal surface of the brain is fully exposed, remove it from the skull by cutting the cranial nerves on the ventral side with the small surgical scissors and gently dislodging the olfactory bulbs with forceps.\nHuman high grade glioma sample acquisition\nTiming: 30 min of transportation between operating room and laboratory\nPatient-derived brain tumor samples obtained at the operation room.\nPatient-derived glioma tumor samples are acquired at the moment of the surgery by specialized neurosurgeons.\nAvoid necrotic regions of the sample.\nImmediately place the samples in cold, oxygenated human culture medium on ice for transportation to the laboratory for processing; limiting the time spent at 20°C–25°C increases tissue viability.\nCritical: Limiting the time between tissue resection and culturing increases model viability.\nEmbedding the mouse or human tumor specimen in 4% agarose\nTiming: 30 min\nMouse brain tumor tissue or patient-derived tumor samples are embedded in agarose to generate a semi rigid block to facilitate sectioning.",
    "Place a 10 cm Petri dish on ice and add cold, oxygenated sectioning medium to submerge the sample. Transfer the sample to the 10 cm Petri dish.\nTransfer the 4% (m/v) agarose to the laminar flow hood and pipette enough into a truncated 12 × 12 mm embedding mold to fill it, approximately 10 mL, avoiding bubbles, and leaving enough room to submerge the sample without causing the agarose to overflow.\nCritical: With the thermometer, ensure the agarose is less than or equal to 37°C before embedding to prevent damaging the tissue sample.\nWith the forceps, submerge the sample in the agarose. Hold it in place with a 10 μL pipet tip until the agarose has cooled and become viscous enough to hold the tissue in place but has not yet solidified so the pipet tip can be removed.\nMouse.\nFor coronal sectioning of a mouse brain, the rostral-caudal axis should be perpendicular to the blade on the vibratome and the specimen dish.\nNote: In the 12 × 12 mm truncated mold, it must therefore be oriented vertically with the olfactory bulbs facing down.\nHuman.\nFor sectioning patient-derived tumor tissue, orient the sample so that the area of each vibrosection is maximized by ensuring the longest axis is parallel to the blade on the vibratome.\nPlace the truncated 12 × 12 mm embedding mold on ice until that agarose is fully solidified, about 5 min.\nCut the corners of the truncated 12 × 12 mm embedding mold with the single sided razorblade and remove the agarose block.",
    "Glue the agarose block to the specimen disc with cyanoacrylate adhesive and allow it to set for 5–8 min on ice. To make coronal sections of a mouse brain, the olfactory bulbs must be face up with the ventral side of the brain towards the blade.\nCritical: if the tissue fell out of the desired orientation during agarose solidification, trim the bottom of the agarose block at an angle with a single sided razor blade to account for the tissue misalignment. The agarose block, depending on how much agarose was added to the truncated 12 × 12 mm embedding mold, may need to be trimmed regardless of tissue orientation so the blade fixture on the vibratome can advance.\nPlace a 10 cm Petri dish on ice in the laminar flow hood and fill it with cold, oxygenated sectioning medium. This is where freshly taken sections will be placed.\nCritical: No more than 90 min should elapse between tissue resection and culturing to limit excessive cell death.\nSectioning with vibratome\nTiming: 30–60 min depending on tissue type\nMouse brain tumors and patient-derived samples are sectioned using an automatic vibratome.\nFasten the buffer tray to the vibratome and fill the cooling bath outside of the buffer tray with ice.\nClean the double-sided razorblade first with acetone and then with 70% (v/v) ethanol. Carefully break the razorblade in half and clamp half of the blade to the knife holder. Fasten the knife holder to the vibratome.\nCritical: If sectioning multiple samples, change the razorblade between them.",
    "Fill the buffer tray with enough cold, oxygenated sectioning medium to submerge the agarose block. Run surgical tubing into the laminar flow hood from the tank of 95% O2 and 5% CO2 gas and oxygenate the cold sectioning medium in the buffer tray using a 1000 μL pipet tip on the end of the surgical tubing.\nFasten the specimen disc with the attached agarose block to the buffer tray.\nSet the section thickness to 250–300 μm on the vibratome.\nAdjust the start and stop points of blade advancement according to the position of agarose block. Set the knife feed speed and knife sectioning frequency. Utilize continuous, automatic blade advancement.\nBegin sectioning, transferring the tissue sections to the 10 cm Petri dish on ice containing the sectioning medium using the mini perforated spoon. Separate the agarose from the tissue with forceps.\nRepeat steps 38–39 until all the desired tissue is sectioned. For mouse tissue, continue. For patient-derived tumor tissue, jump to step 49 under ‘Staining of patient-derived tumor samples.’\nFor mouse tissue, use an epifluorescent stereomicroscope to select only the vibrosections that contain GFP+ tumor. Use the microscope to determine which sections bear tumor and mark them by annotating the lid of the 10 cm Petri dish with a marker.\nRemove the six well plate containing the cell culture inserts and the 50 mL conical tube containing the primary mouse culture medium from the cell culture incubator and place them in the laminar flow hood.\nPipette off the laminin solution and wash the laminin-coated cell culture inserts once with DPBS supplemented with magnesium and calcium then twice with the warmed primary mouse culture medium.\nTransfer the explants to the laminin-coated cell culture inserts.\nPipet enough primary mouse culture medium into the insert to barely cover the explants.",
    "Pipet 2 mL of medium into the bottom of the well outside of the cell culture insert.\nCritical: adding too much medium will cause the explants to float, not adhere to the laminin coating, and make time-lapse imaging impossible. Ensure that tissue is covered by medium.\nPlace the six well plate containing the vibrosections plated on the laminin-coated cell culture inserts back in the cell culture incubator at 37°C.\nAfter 6–18 h, transfer the cell culture insert to be imaged to a glass bottom dish using sterile forceps in a laminar flow hood and change the media to secondary mouse culture medium. Add 2 mL per dish and keep it in the incubator for 20 min to stabilize.\nTransfer the cell culture inserts to the confocal microscope for time-lapse imaging.\nStaining of patient-derived tumor samples for tumor viability and visualization analysis\nTiming: 1.5 h\nPatient-derived brain tumor samples are stained with Hoechst and Calcein for tumor viability analysis and fluorescence microscope migration studies.\nStart the staining of the explants with Hoechst 33342 and Calcein AM in a six well plate without the inserts.\nIncubate the explants for 1.5 h in Hoechst (1:4000) and 2 μM Calcein then wash with warm human culture medium three times.\nWash Matrigel®-coated cell culture inserts with warm human culture medium three times.\nIn the laminar flow hood, transfer the explants to the Matrigel®-coated cell culture inserts and pipet enough secondary mouse culture medium to barely cover the explants. Pipet 2 mL of medium into the bottom of the well outside of the cell culture insert.\nCritical: adding too much media will cause the explants to float, not adhere to the Matrigel® coating, and make time-lapse imaging impossible. Conversely, too little media will lead to tissue death.",
    "Time-lapse single photon laser scanning confocal imaging of tumor cell migration\nTiming: 45 min (The time for setting the microscope could vary depending on the tissue; bigger tissue size and better quality requires more imaging sites. Time lapse confocal imaging can be performed from 24 to 72 h)\nExplants slices are incubated in a humidified, temperature and CO2 controlled incubation chamber included as part of a laser scanning confocal microscope for time lapse imaging.\nThis methodology is detailed for an inverted Zeiss LSM880 laser scanning confocal microscope with AiryScan (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Another similar confocal microscope could be used.\nStart the microscope and set the temperature of the humidified incubation chamber to 37°C. Turn on the CO2 and set it to 5%. Let temperature and CO2 levels to equilibrate for 20 min.\nCritical: Utilize an extra container with sterile water placed into the big incubator chamber to maintain the humidity and prevent excessive media evaporation (especially important for longer imaging experiments).\nTransfer the glass bottom dish with the tissue sections into the microscope incubator chamber. Allow media to equilibrate at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 15 min.\nSecure the glass bottom plate to avoid movement of the explant section during imaging.\nAfter sections were maintained in the incubator for 15 min, you can start the microscope settings for time lapse confocal imaging.\nSelect the objective to use. For confocal imaging, explants are placed into a 27 mm Nunc glass base dish and on top of an insert.\nNote: Under these conditions it is recommended to use an air 10×/0.3 EC Plan-Neofluar with a working distance of 5.2 mm or air 20×/0.4 LD Plan-Neofluar with a 7.9 mm working distance objective or similar.",
    "Turn on the Argon 488 nm and the DPSS 561 nm excitation lasers, set the laser power for each laser equally for all positions.\nCritical: To avoid damage in the tissue and photobleaching, set laser power to the minimum level possible.\nFor GFP+ tumors and Tdtomato+ parenchyma, perform simultaneous excitation at 488 nm and 561 nm using scan mode: frame; frame size 1024 × 1024 or higher and averaging mode: line.\nUse ocular observation and the locate function to select a position (x,y,z) of interest. Save each position. Different positions and different slice can be imaged at the same time.\nTo address the analysis of the explant in 3D, set the Z stack positions. Select the first (bottom) and the last (top) positions on focus for the explant. To do 2D image scanning, select an intermediate position between the extreme positions of the explants. This will avoid imaging the explant on the top or the bottom surface of the slices and will validate the depth of imaging.\nUse the Time Series function to set the time intervals. Usually, >300 cycles at an interval of 10 min.\nSet number of tile scan per location. Using a 10× objective, do not use tile scan but use 2 × 2 tile scan for a 20× objective.\nSelect Focus strategy to Autofocus Mode “Fluorescence” for every time and every position.\nUse AutoSave imagining or Streaming function.\nStart running the time lapse scanning imaging. Imaging can be performed for between 24 and 72 h.\nTreatment response using glioma explants slices\nTiming: 24–72 h (time will vary depending on the treatment)\nExplant slices could be cultured in different plate size or multiwell plates for treatment analysis.\nExplants can be used to study the response to drug or standard of care treatment.",
    "Place explant on top of inserts in different wells as required depending on the experimental conditions and number of repetitions.\nNote: For high-throughput screening of different compounds or treatments, the use of 96 well plates or higher is recommended.\nApply media with the corresponding treatment into each well.\nNote: Explants under treatment can be used for the analysis of cell viability, apoptosis or even cell migration and invasion using confocal imaging.\nAfter treatment, remove media and fix the tissue in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 24–48 h.\nTissue fixation\nTiming: 24 h (tissue fixation could be performed between 24 and 48 h)\nAfter the tissue has been used for time lapse confocal imaging or for drug screening and treatment response, explants can be fixed, cryopreserved and cryosectioned or paraffin embedded and micro-sectioned for further experimental approaches such as histopathological analysis using H&E staining, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, spatial transcriptomic (RNA-Scope) and other desirable spatial and molecular methods (See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nAfter completion of image acquisition, remove the sample dish from the microscope platform.\nRemove the secondary mouse culture medium from the cell culture inserts and dish and fill them with 4% PFA.\nCritical: PFA and its vapors are hazardous, always utilize proper personal protective equipment and perform actions under a chemical hood to avoid exposure of the eyes and skin.\nSecure the lid of the 10 cm Petri dish with parafilm and leave the tissue at 4°C for 24–48 h.\nIn a chemical hood, use a pipette to remove as much of the 4% PFA as possible, discarding it properly. Wash the tissue sections with DPBS without Ca2+ or Mg2+ two times.\nPause point: If you cannot proceed to tissue embedding, you can leave the slices in DPBS at 4°C for 2–4 days.",
    "Continue to either Tissue Processing for Cryosections or Agarose Embedding for Tissue Processing in Paraffin.\nTissue processing for cryosections\nTiming: 24 h (tissue is incubated overnight)\nTissue could be embedded in OCT media to generate cryosections. Cryosections will maintain the staining with dyes such as Hoechst and Calcein AM for further analysis.\nAfter PFA fixation, transfer tissue to 30% sucrose (m/v) solution overnight at 4°C.\nPrepare a plastic container filled with cold isopentane/2-methylbutane and place into a metal container filled with liquid nitrogen.\nWith a micropipette, spread a thin layer of OCT media in the bottom of a disposable plastic base mold.\nUsing a flat micro-spatula remove the brain from the 30% sucrose solution and transfer an explant from the culture insert onto the OCT coating. Fill the plastic mold with OCT assuring that the tissue slices are submerged.\nUsing forceps, quickly place the cryomold with OCT and the explants into the isopentane/2-methylbutane.\nUpon solidification of the OCT, remove the cryomold with the explants in dry ice. Store it at −80°C.\nAgarose embedding for tissue processing in paraffin\nTiming: 30 min\nExplant slices are embedded in agarose to facilitate tissue processing and paraffin embedding.\nMelt the 2% (m/v) agarose by swirling and heating in the microwave until light boiling is observed and the solution is transparent.\nCritical: If using a container with a cap or lid, make sure to loosen it so the container does not build up pressure while heating to prevent container breakage and injury. Place the agarose in a 40°C water bath to maintain its liquid state.\nWith a micropipette, spread 500 μL of 2% agarose into a thin, even coat in the bottom of a disposable plastic base mold.",
    "With a flat micro-spatula, transfer an explant from a cell culture insert onto the agarose bed. Fill the plastic mold the rest of the way, fully submerging the tissue slices.\nAllow the agarose to solidify at 20°C–25°C. Carefully remove the agarose block with a microspatula.\nPlace the agarose block in a labeled tissue MACROSETTE™, sandwiched between two rectangular foam biopsy pads.\nRepeat steps 81–84 for all vibrosections to be embedded in paraffin. Multiple sections can be placed in the sabe mold.\nStore the MACROSETTES™ in 70% ethanol for up to 24 h before embedding in paraffin. If it will be longer than 24 h, store in DPBS without Ca2+ or Mg2+ before transferring to 70% ethanol.\nTissue processing and paraffin embedding\nTiming: 14 h (program runs overnight)\nExplant slices are processed in an alcohol series and subsequently embedded in paraffin for further analysis in tissue sections.\nNote: Alternative tissue processing procedures shorter than the one utilized in this protocol can be performed. The following steps were performed in an automated Leica ASP 300S however other devices can be used or the process can be done by hand. Following tissue fixation, the tissue must be dehydrated (usually with ethanol), cleared (usually with xylene), then infiltrated with paraffin.\nImmerse MACROSETTES™ in 70% ethanol at 20°C–22°C under a vacuum for 1 h, let drain for 30 s.\nImmerse MACROSETTES™ in 80% ethanol at 20°C–22°C under a vacuum for 1 h, let drain for 1 min.\nImmerse MACROSETTES™ in 95% ethanol at 20°C–22°C under a vacuum for 1 h, let drain for 1 min.\nImmerse MACROSETTES™ in 95% ethanol at 20°C–22°C under a vacuum for 1 h, let drain for 1 min.\nImmerse MACROSETTES™ in 100% ethanol at 20°C–22°C under a vacuum for 1 h, let drain for 1 min.",

Take care to go slowly as the agarose can fracture during trimming.\nPlace the trimmed agarose block in a heated metal mold and transfer the mold to the cold plate. Press down on the agarose block to adhere it to the metal mold. Apply enough pressure to remove any air bubbles trapped between the agarose block and the metal mold however do not fracture the agarose.\nFill the metal mold with liquid paraffin, place the corresponding microcassette on top of the mold, and add enough additional liquid paraffin to fill the microcassette.",
    "Gently transfer the metal mold and microcassette to the cold plate and allow the paraffin to solidify.\nOnce the paraffin is cool to the touch, carefully remove the paraffin block and microcassette.\nThe explants are now ready to be sectioned on a microtome at 5 μm, mounted on slides, and stained as needed for further experiments including H&E, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and multiplex assays such as RNAScope.\nPost-imaging statistical analysis of tumor cell migration\nTiming: 1.5 h per movie\nTo determine the movement of cells at various locations of the tumor and analyze patterns of migration, perform a localized statistical analysis. Select localized areas based on the organization of cells in clusters migrating together with a similar distribution.\nExperimental dataset (time-lapse imaging)\nThe raw dataset consists of time-lapse videos acquired with a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM 880, Axio Observer, Zeiss, Germany) using Zen (Blue edition) version 2.5 at the time interval of Δt = 10 min per frame using 10× objective covering approx. 850.19 × 850.19 μm (size in pixels: 1024 × 1024). Statistical analysis involves the TrackMate plugin, Image J Software, Julia, RStudio, and scripts that are available on GitHub and Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7587235[href=https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7587235]). Step-by-step information to analyze the glioma dynamics is provided below:\nTracking using TrackMate.\nTo track the migration of cells, use the software Fiji (https://imagej.net/software/fiji/[href=https://imagej.net/software/fiji/]) with the plugin TrackMate (https://imagej.net/plugins/trackmate[href=https://imagej.net/plugins/trackmate]).\nThe start panel will launch, showing information about the image dimensions.\nTo capture cells to track click “Next”, a new panel will pop up to select cell size which is called “blob”. Select 20 μm and a threshold of 1 together with the DoG method (Difference of Gaussian detectors).\nWhen the progress bar has reached the end, click “Next.”\nA tracking panel opens, we use the “Simple LAP” tracker and click “Next.”",
    "A “Track filter” panel opens. Remove tracks according to their properties and select at least 10 tracks for each spot and remove the ones that are below 10 tracks, click “Next.”\nFor each time-lapse video, several trajectories of cells are developed in the analysis panel. Click the “Analysis” tab and three windows pop up with “Spots”, “Tracks Statistics” and “Link in Track Statistics.” Use the two CSV files named ”Spots” and “Tracks Statistics” for further analysis.\nStep B: Trajectories graph using spots.csv and tracks.csv files employing Julia scripts.\nAs a result of TrackMate analysis, we obtain two CSV files.\nAs an example, and illustration, one can find these files on GitHub (https://github.com/smotsch/analysis_glioma[href=https://github.com/smotsch/analysis_glioma]) in the folder data tracking step1_data_trackMate/NPA_stich_3.\nThe positions (X, Y) of the cells (see the file ∗spots.csv) along with the trajectories (∗tracks.csv) are also provided there.\nOn running the script, individual cell trajectories graph of the time-lapse datasets is generated as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nStep C: Filtering.\nTo reduce this erratic behavior, we need to filter the trajectories.\nFrom the data obtained with TrackMate, we then smooth trajectories which allows for estimating the velocity of each cell at any given time.\nUse a Gaussian kernel as a filter (with standard deviation σ = 2 and a stencil of 9 points).\nRun the script in Julia to perform this step, the script is in the folder src at GitHub (https://github.com/smotsch/analysis_glioma/tree/main/src[href=https://github.com/smotsch/analysis_glioma/tree/main/src]) naming as step2_filter_data.jl.\nOn running the script, individual cell trajectories graph of the time-lapse datasets will be filtered.\nThis filtering step also estimates the positions Xi(t) and velocities Vi(t) of the cells i.",
    "From the velocity Vi(t), we also deduce the velocity direction θi(t). We can now apply several statistics to investigate cell behavior. A path obtained with ImageJ (dashed line) and the filtered path (red) obtained after filtering should be applied. The smooth path allows estimating the velocity of the cell at each time step.\nAll the trajectories are saved in jld2 file in the folder data_tracking at GitHub (https://github.com/smotsch/analysis_glioma/tree/main/data_tracking[href=https://github.com/smotsch/analysis_glioma/tree/main/data_tracking]) naming as step2_data_filtered.\nStep D: Localized Statistics: velocity or correlation distribution.\nNote: Each cell is characterized by a position xi ∈ R2 and a velocity vi ∈ R2. The velocity vector v can be split into magnitude; speed (scalar) c = |v| and angle direction θ such that v = c(cos θ, sin θ). To investigate the distribution of velocity angle θ, speed c and velocity vector v, three statistics will be performed as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F.\nDistribution of velocity angle gives an indication of the overall direction of the cells.\nOverall, statistics analysis in specific zones is assigned manually on the basis of the organization/pattern in glioma explants once the movie is complete.\nThe coordinates of each zone are determined by using Fiji coordinate function. Fiji will display the coordinates of the cursor position x, and y position in μm.\nCoordinates allow us to perform the statistics in specific zones and the files of x and y coordinates save in a JSON file format called “coordinates.json” (the representative template file is provided at GitHub: https://github.com/smotsch/analysis_glioma/tree/main/data_tracking/step3_data_zone/NPA_stich_3[href=https://github.com/smotsch/analysis_glioma/tree/main/data_tracking/step3_data_zone/NPA_stich_3]).\n“Coordinate.json” will be used in Julia to assign different zones: script to run and generate zone is available as “step3_zone_create_df.jl” at GitHub (https://github.com/smotsch/analysis_glioma/blob/main/src/step3_zone_create_df.jl[href=https://github.com/smotsch/analysis_glioma/blob/main/src/step3_zone_create_df.jl]).\nExecution of script will generate data frames containing the analysis of each zone. Repeat run twice to execute velocity or correlation analysis using Julia script provided at GitHub (https://github.com/smotsch/analysis_glioma/blob/main/src/step3_zone_create_df.jl[href=https://github.com/smotsch/analysis_glioma/blob/main/src/step3_zone_create_df.jl]).",
    "Line 13 of the script needs to change for velocity and correlation as shown below:\nvelocity_or_correlation = “velocity” # “velocity” or “correlation”\nvelocity_or_correlation = “correlation” # “velocity” or “correlation”\nThe final graph of the velocity or correlation analysis can be generated using Julia scripts provided at GitHub (https://github.com/smotsch/analysis_glioma/tree/main/src[href=https://github.com/smotsch/analysis_glioma/tree/main/src]).\n“step3_zone_velocity_plot.jl.”\n“step3_zone_correlation_plot.jl.”\nResults pertaining to angle velocity, speed distribution and velocity heatmap of each zone can be easily accessed as a pdf in df velocity folder while correlation, nematic correlation, and relative position can be accessed in df_correlation folder [The illustration of the datasets result is represented on GitHub (https://github.com/smotsch/analysis_glioma/tree/main/data_tracking/step3_data_zone/NPA_stich_3[href=https://github.com/smotsch/analysis_glioma/tree/main/data_tracking/step3_data_zone/NPA_stich_3]).\nStep E: Likelihood Analysis using RStudio scripts to classify collective patterns of migration.\nTo classify a pattern of migration or invasion in each zone (flock, stream or swarm), utilize the collection of angles θi inside a specific zone and assess three distributions, which are (wrapped) Gaussian for a flock, a symmetric Gaussian for a stream and the constant function for a swarm (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H and 2I).\nAkaike weight distribution analysis matches the best distribution of θi.\nTo determine the likelihood analysis and specify whether the zone is flock, stream or swarm, run the R script provided on GitHub (https://github.com/smotsch/analysis_glioma/blob/main/src/step4_zone_testing_distribution.r[href=https://github.com/smotsch/analysis_glioma/blob/main/src/step4_zone_testing_distribution.r]).\nThe zone distribution graph will be generated in R Studio (https://www.r-project.org/[href=https://www.r-project.org/]) along with the Akaike weight results.\nAW close to 1 will be considered as the highest likelihood and disregards the other ones that are not close to AW = 1."
