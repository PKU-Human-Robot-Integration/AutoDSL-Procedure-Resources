    "This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Shandong Provincial ENT Hospital (approval No. XYK20211201). Informed consent was obtained from all study participants.\n1. Instrumentation\nUse a standard sound booth (≤30 dB [A]), including a calibrated audiometer, a computer, and two loudspeakers. 'A' means the human hearing response to sound through a weighted filtering. The unit of measurement is dB SPL (sound pressure level). Perform all tests using the loudspeaker.\nUse mapping software to fit the participants. Assess the speech performance of monosyllable recognition in quiet conditions, spondee (disyllable) speech recognition in quiet conditions, sentence recognition in quiet conditions, and sentence recognition in noisy conditions. For this experiment, 20 monosyllables (i.e., cai, chu, fei, fen, feng, ge, mi, pi, qi, qiao, qing, sha, shen, shi, tao, tui, xiang, xie, xuan, and zhe), combined with four lexical tones spoken by a male native Mandarin Chinese speaker were selected.\nAssess tone recognition using tone test software. For this experiment, four tones in each monosyllable that retained the natural variation in durations were selected. Normalize the tokens to the same root mean square level to eliminate natural variation in amplitude.\n\t\nChoose one correct answer from four tones in the Mandarin lexical tone task. For this experiment, 25 monosyllabic words were spoken with the four Mandarin lexical tones, 80 tone tokens were created for each test, and words were written in simplified Chinese.\nAssess music pitch perception using music software. For the protocol here, use a test battery consisting of six objective subtests assessing several areas of music perception. The battery contains approximately 2,800 sound files.\n\t\nFor the pitch-ranking procedure, use different instruments in the range of 27-4,186 Hz. The pitch ranking test used a two-interval, two-alternative, forced-choice adaptive procedure to determine the threshold for discriminating variation of pitch.",
    "For this experiment, set the target tone to the sine note of F4 (349 Hz) and start 32 quartertones above the target tone. Set the interval size of the two tones between one and 26 quartertones. The quartertone interval was produced from the nearest semitone.\n2. Participant preparation\nNOTE: A total of 10 participants (seven males, three females) volunteered for this study, two of whom volunteered to film the protocol. The participants were unilateral CI users with a mean age of 10.4 ± 1.2 years (range: 9-14 years), who were implanted at a mean age of 2.8 ± 1.2 years (range: 1-4 years) and had at least 5 years of experience using the CIS+ coding strategy (Table 1). All the participants were fluent in Mandarin and were willing to comply with all planned study procedures.\nTo be included, ensure the potential participants have at least 5 years of experience using the CIS+ coding strategy with a TEMPO+ audio processor, speak Mandarin, and are willing to comply with the planned study procedures.\nUse the exclusion criteria as unwillingness or inability to cooperate with the test procedures.\nScreen the participants in accordance with the inclusion/exclusion criteria mentioned above. Obtain verbal and written informed consent from all participants.\nPosition the participants 1 m from the loudspeaker, at a 45° angle to the CI side in the sound booth when testing.\nRemove any hearing aids, if present, from the contralateral ear and make sure the masking (earplug and earmuffs) is effective for participants with residual hearing.\nInform the participants that practice test sessions will be conducted until they understand the task. When the task is understood, formal testing can begin. Inform the participants that they can take breaks when needed.\n3. Experimental protocol",
    "Complete a battery of tests at each of the following four intervals: (i) pre-upgrade (the old processor and coding strategy), (ii) immediately post-upgrade (i.e., same day as the upgrade to the new processor and coding strategy), (iii) 6 weeks post-upgrade, and (iv) 3 months post-upgrade.\nImmediately at the post-upgrade interval, test each participant with both coding strategies. Randomize the order in which they are tested, either CIS first or FS4. Blind the participants to which coding strategy they are being tested with.\nPerform mapping, as described below.\n\tNOTE: Mapping refers to programming the stimulation levels of each of the 12 channels on the array. In the present study, this was done according to the responses of each CI user and resulted in each participant receiving a customized fitting map.\n\t\nTake the participants and guardians to the mapping room (sound booth). Seat the participants in the mapping room.\nClick the mapping software and enter the password. Take off the speech processor and connect it to the MAX box via the programming cable.\nSelect the participant's name on the software and choose the impedance option. Test the electrode impedance and make sure the electrode impedance is normal (2.2-12 kOhm; typical value). Abnormal electrode impedance is automatically shown with open circuits or short circuits.\nEnsure that the coding strategy is FS4 and a standard pulse rate of 1,224 pps/channel is used. Set single electrode stimulation to three sweeps and let the participants distinguish the loudness of each electrode by pointing to the appropriate image on a loud/comfort pictorial scale. Use up and down methods for testing and take the same results that are repeated twice as the final electrical stimulation result. Make sure the participants understand and can accomplish this task.",
    "Set the maximum comfortable level (MCL) of all the electrodes using the method mentioned above (step 3.3.4). The MCL is considered the highest (i.e., loudest) level that is not uncomfortable. In the present study, participants indicate this on a loud/comfort pictorial scale.\n\t\t\nTo test the real-life application of the MCL levels, activate the map by pressing the Live button. This allows the participants to hear ambient noises. Return the participants to the fitting mode. Based on their subjective feedback from listening in live mode, adjust the MCLs if needed.\nSet other parameters with the default settings: the stimulation rate is 1,288 pps; the channel-specific sampling sequences (CSSSs) channel is four; the pulse is biphasic pulse; the phase gap (IPG) is 2.1 µs; the input and output signals are logarithmic compression with the default MCL value set to 500; the compression ratio is 3:1; the sensitivity is 75%; the threshold (THR), which is the maximum sound level that the participant cannot hear, is generally 10% of the MCL. Verify the THR for each channel by retesting, as in the MCL; the frequency range is 70-8,500 Hz.\nPerform speech tests, as described below.\n\t\nTest speech perception in the following order: spondee (disyllable) speech recognition in quiet conditions, monosyllable recognition in quiet conditions, sentence recognition in quiet conditions, and sentence recognition in noisy conditions.\nSeat the participants 1 m beside the computer from the loudspeaker at a 45° angle to the CI side in another sound booth.\nEnsure the processors are switched on and the program is correct. Click the speech software and carefully interpret the answer methods. Tell the participants to clearly repeat the content they have heard. Be careful to ensure that the practice test procedure is correct.",
    "Open the audiometry and select the hearing test options. Set the sound loudness to 30 dB HL (hearing level) above the average pure-tone threshold of 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 4,000 Hz through the audiometry.\nPresent the practice lists at the time of the formal tests23. For each test, ask the participants to repeat the words/sentences they heard. Keep the order of contents random for each test and play the words/sentences once.\nSet a +10 dB signal to noise ratio (SNR) for the sentence recognition in noisy conditions test and use four-talker babble as the noise signal.\nPerform the tone test, as described below.\n\t\nClick the tone software and set the SPL to 65 dB in the same sound booth. Carefully interpret the answer methods.\nConfirm that the participants are familiar with all of the vocabulary tested. Present the practice lists at the same time as the formal test21.\nDirect the participants to say what they have heard once. Choose the tone in which the participants repeat the content and keep the order of contents random for each test.\nPerform the music test, as described below.\n\t\nClick the music software and choose the pitch selection in the same booth. Present the practice lists at the same time as the formal test24.\nInstruct the participant to listen to the two stimuli presented sequentially with 1 s of silence in between. Ask them to determine which of the two intervals has a falling or rising pitch contour.\nInput the answers of the participant and repeat. Keep the order of contents random for both practice and normal tests. Choose the answers the participants selected.\n4. Data analysis\nFor speech and tone tests, record the percentage of correct answers provided and compare for each test. For the musical pitch test, record the quartertones and compare.",
    "Depending on the data distribution, apply repeated measures (RM) ANOVA with time as a factor, or the Friedman test to examine a change over time. Use pairwise comparisons to compare the performance after upgrading compared to pre-upgrading, with either paired samples t-testing or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.\nUse the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test together with the Shapiro-Wilk test to check the data distribution. If both tests confirm that the data were normally distributed, then apply parametric statistical methods. Otherwise, apply non-parametric statistical methods. Set the statistical significance at p ≤ 0.05.\nBecause of multiple comparisons (three pairwise comparisons: pre-upgrade vs. immediately post-upgrade, pre-upgrade vs. 6 weeks post-upgrade, and pre-upgrade vs. 3 months post-upgrade), use the Bonferroni correction method when interpreting the obtained p values. Hence, use p ≤ 0.017 instead of p ≤ 0.05 as significant."
