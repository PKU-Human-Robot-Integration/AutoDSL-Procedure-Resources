    "**MEF depletion on Matrigel \\(d-1)**\n1. Thaw Matrigel on ice and leave the ice bucket with the Matrigel at 4<sup>o</sup>C overnight. \n  2. Dilute Matrigel in cold IMDM \\(1:30).\n  3. Add 6 ml of diluted Matrigel solution to each 10 cm<sup>2</sup> tissue culture-treated dishes and let them sit for at least 3 hours at room temperature or overnight at 4<sup>o</sup>C.\n  4. To make one 6-well plate embryoid bodies \\(EBs), dissociate two confluent wells \\(from a 6-well plate) of human pluripotent stem cells \\(hPSCs) using 1ml/well Accutase and incubate in a normoxic incubator for 2-3 minutes.\n  5. Aspirate the Accutase.\n  6. Neutralize the enzyme by stop media. \n  7. Pellet the dissociated cells by centrifugation at 1,400 r.p.m. for 4 minutes.\n  8. Aspirate enzyme and stop media as much as possible.\n  9. Re-suspend the cells with 10-12 ml hPSC maintenance media.\n  10. Plate the cells in a Matrigel-coated dish \\(see step 3) after aspiration of the supernatant from the dish.\n  11. Incubate the cells in a normoxic incubator overnight.\n  \n**Endoderm induction \\(d0-d4)**\n1. On d0, remove the hPSC maintenance media from the Matrigel-coated dish and add 3 ml trypsin. Incubate the dish for 1-1.5 minutes in a normoxic incubator.\n  2. Aspirate trypsin solution and stop the remaining enzyme by adding 10 ml stop media.\n  3. Collect the detached cells and pellet by centrifugation at 1,400 r.p.m. for 4 minutes.\n  4. Aspirate the enzyme and stop media.\n  5. Re-suspend the cells with 12 ml Embryoid bodies/primitive streak formation media and distribute to a 6-well low-attachment plate \\(2 ml/well).\n  6. Place the low-attachment plate in a low oxygen incubator to allow embryoid body \\(EB) formation.\n  7. After 12-16 hours , collect all EBs in a 15-ml tube and centrifuge at 800 r.p.m. for 1 minute.\n  8. Aspirate the Embryoid bodies/primitive streak formation media.",
    "9. Gently re-suspend the EBs with 12 ml Endoderm induction media and distribute them equally back to the low-attachment plate \\(2 ml/well). \n  10. Return the plate back to a low oxygen incubator.\n  11. On d2, add 1 ml fresh Endoderm induction media to each well.\n  12. On d3, add 2 ml fresh Endoderm induction media to each well. \n  13. On d4.1-d4.3, check endoderm yield by flow cytometric analysis of CXCR4 and c-kit expression. If the endoderm yield is >90%, continue the differentiation **\\(Fig. 1) \\(Please see trouble shooting point 1)**.\n  \n**Anteriorization \\(d5-d6)**\n1. Prepare fibronectin-coated 6-well plates by diluting fibronectin to 0.2% \\(vol/vol, 1:500, 4 μg/ml) in DPBS. Add 2ml fibronectin/DPBS solution to each well and incubate the plates in a normoxic incubator for at least 30 minutes or 4<sup>o</sup>C overnight.\n  2. Dissociate the EBs into single cells with trypsin \\(3ml of trypsin per 6-well plate of EBs for a maximum 4-minute digestion) **\\(Please see trouble shooting point 2)**.\n  3. Neutralize the enzyme by stop media. \n  4. Count the cells using a hemocytometer.\n  5. Pellet the dissociated cells by centrifugation at 1,400 r.p.m. for 4 minutes.\n  6. Aspirate the stop media.\n  7. Re-suspend the cells with Anteriorization media-1 at 7.5 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/2 ml **\\(Please see trouble shooting point 3)**.\n  8. Add 2 ml of cell mixture to each well \\(6-well plate, fibronectin-coated, see step 1). \n  9. Incubate the plates in a normoxic incubator.\n  10. After 24 hours \\(± 1 hour), replace the Anteriorization media-1 with Anteriorization media-2 \\(2ml/well).\n  11. Return the plates back to a normoxic incubator.\n  \n**Ventralization and Lung Bud Organoid \\(LBO) formation \\(d6-d25)**\n1. After 24 hours \\(± 1 hour), replace the Anteriorization media-2 with Ventralization media/Branching media \\(2ml/well). \n  2. Return the plates back to a normoxic incubator.",
    "3. Forty-eight hours later, aspirate all the Ventralization media/Branching media and add 2 ml fresh Ventralization media/Branching media to each well. \n  4. Suspend the organoids by gently pipetting up and down throughout the well with P1000 tips. \n  5. Transfer the suspended organoids to non-tissue culture-treated plates **\\(Please see trouble shooting point 4)**.\n  6. Return the plates back to a normoxic incubator.\n  7. Feed the organoids every other day by tilting the plate and allowing the organoids to sink to the bottom edge. Remove the old media while avoiding touching the organoids. Add 2 ml fresh Ventralization media/Branching media to each well **\\(Please see trouble shooting point 5)**.\n  \n**Branching organoid \\(d20-end of experiment)**\n1. Between d20-d25, select the organoids with folding structures under picking hood **\\(Fig. 2)**. \n  2. Put the desired number of organoids per insert into each well \\(96-well U-bottom plate containing 100 μl of fresh Ventralization media/Branching media per well). Typically, one to four organoids are plated per insert \\(24-well insert).\n  3. Place 24-well inserts into non-tissue culture treated plates. \n  4. Lay 50 μl of 100% cold Matrigel into the bottom of each insert. \n  5. Wait 5 minutes or until the Matrigel has solidified.\n  6. Remove the Ventralization media/Branching media one well at a time **\\(Please see trouble shooting point 6)**.\n  7. Mix the organoids with 30 μl of 100% cold Matrigel gently to avoid creating bubbles. \n  8. Immediately put the organoid-Matrigel mixture in the center of an insert. \n  9. Wait for 5 minutes for the Matrigel to solidify to secure the organoids in the center of the insert.\n  10. Add another 50 μl of 100% cold Matrigel to the insert to create a Matrigel sandwich. \n  11. Put the plates in a normoxic incubator for 10 minutes to make sure all Matrigel has solidified.",
    "12. Add 500 μl of Ventralization media/Branching media to the insert and another 500 μl of Ventralization media/Branching media into the wells.\n  13. Incubate the cultures in a normoxic incubator and replace the media every 2-3 days **\\(Please see trouble shooting point 7)**."
