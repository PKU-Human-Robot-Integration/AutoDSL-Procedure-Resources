  "procedures": [
    "All the procedures described here were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines for the care and use of animals in research, and the protocol was approved by the Duke Institute of Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). C57BL/6 male and female mice aged 8-10 weeks old were used for the present study.\n1. Surgical preparation\nWeigh a mouse on a digital scale, and place it into a 4 in x 4 in x 7 in plexiglass anesthesia induction box.\nAdjust the anesthesia vaporizer to 5% isoflurane, the oxygen flow meter to 30, and the nitrogen flow meter to 70 (see Table of Materials).\nTake the animal out of the induction box, and lay it in a supine position on the surgical bench when its respiratory rate has decreased to 30-40 breaths per minute.\nPull out the tongue with blunt forceps, and hold it using the non-dominant hand. Use the dominant hand to insert a laryngoscope (see Table of Materials) into the mouse's mouth and visualize the vocal cord.\nUse the non-dominant hand to insert a guide wire and 20 G intravenous catheter into the mouth. Gently insert the guide wire into the trachea.\nPush the catheter into the trachea until the wing part of the catheter is even with the nose tip.\n\tNOTE: Do not intubate a mouse that is not fully anesthetized since this may injure the trachea and cause airway bleeding.\nConnect the intubated mouse to a small animal ventilator (see Table of Materials), and reduce the isoflurane to 1.5%.\nInput the mouse's body weight into the control panel of the ventilator to determine the tidal volume and respiratory rate.\nKeep the mouse in a supine position under a heat lamp, and maintain the rectal temperature at 37 °C with a temperature controller.",
    "Shave the inguinal areas, disinfect the surgical area at least three times with iodine and alcohol (see Table of Materials), and cover the area with a sterile surgical drape.\nApply eye ointment to both eyes and administer 5 mg/kg carprofen subcutaneously before surgery.\nOpen the sterile instrument package for surgery. Make a 1 cm skin incision with surgical scissors to access the femoral arteries on both sides. Dissect and ligate the distal femoral artery with a single strand of 4-0 silk suture (see Table of Materials), and apply one drop of lidocaine.\nApply an aneurysm clip at the proximal femoral artery and make a small cut on the artery distal to the clip. Insert a polyethylene 10 (PE-10, see Table of Materials) catheter into the left and the right femoral arteries.\n\tNOTE: The left arterial line is used for blood pressure monitoring, while the right one is used for blood withdrawal and resuscitation mixture infusion.\nInject 50 µL of 1:10 heparinized saline into each arterial line to prevent clotting in the line.\nTurn the mouse to the prone position, and mount it on a stereotaxic head frame.\nConnect three needle electrodes (red, green, and black) to the left arm, left leg, and right arm for electrocardiogram (ECG, see Table of Materials) monitoring.\nGlue a flexible plastic fiber probe onto the intact temporal skull through a 0.5 cm skin incision for cerebral blood flow monitoring. This step is optional.\nShave the top of the head, disinfect the surgical area at least three times with iodine and alcohol, and cover the area with a sterile surgical drapel.\nCut a 2.5 cm midline skin incision, and use four small retractors to expose the entire skull surface for brain imaging.",
    "Place a monitoring imager (e.g., a laser speckle contrast imager, see Table of Materials) above the head.\n\tNOTE: A few drops of saline can be added to the skull surface to facilitate laser speckle contrast imaging.\n2. Induction of cardiac arrest\nFill a 1 mL plastic syringe with 26 µL of the resuscitation cocktail stock solution.\n\tNOTE: Each milliliter of this solution contains 400 µL of 1 mg/mL epinephrine, 500 µL of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate, 50 µL of 1,000 U/mL heparin, and 50 µL of 0.9% sodium chloride (see Table of Materials).\nWait until the body temperature reaches 37 °C. Adjust the oxygen meter to 100% to oxygenate the blood for 2 min.\nWithdraw the oxygenated arterial blood up to 200 µL via the right femoral artery into the prepared plastic syringe containing 26 µL of resuscitation cocktail stock solution.\nSwitch off the oxygen, and increase the nitrogen to 100% to induce anoxia.\n\tNOTE: After approximately 45 s, the heart will fail to function, and the heart rate will rapidly decrease, indicating the onset of CA. After about 2 min of oxygen deprivation, the ECG monitoring will indicate an asystole, and there will be no measurable systemic blood pressure and negligible cerebral blood flow.\nTurn off the ventilator, isoflurane vaporizer, temperature controller, and nitrogen flowmeter. Adjust the oxygen to 100% in preparation for resuscitation.\n3. Resuscitation procedure\nTurn the ventilator on at 8 min after CA onset.\nImmediately start to infuse the withdrawn oxygenated blood mixed with the resuscitation cocktail into the blood circulation via the right femoral artery in 1 min.\n\tNOTE: The infusion leads to a gradual increase in the heart rate and the restoration of blood perfusion; eventually, the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is achieved.\n4. Post-CA recovery",
    "Place the mouse in the supine position after removing it from the stereotaxic frame, and remove the PE-10 catheters from the femoral arteries.\nApply 0.25% bupivacaine to the skin incision, and suture the skin incisions using a 6-0 nylon suture (see Table of Materials). Apply antibiotic ointment to the surface of the skin incision.\nDisconnect the mouse ventilator when spontaneous respiration is restored.\nTransfer the mouse to a recovery chamber with a controlled temperature of 32 °C.\nAfter 2 h of recovery, extubate the mouse, and return to the home cage. Inject 0.5 mL of normal saline subcutaneously to prevent dehydration.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
