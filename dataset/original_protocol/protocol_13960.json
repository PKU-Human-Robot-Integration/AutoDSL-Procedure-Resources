    "All protocol regarding animal experiment follows the standard operating procedures for laboratory animal breeding in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8th Edition, 2011) and is approved by the institutional animal care and use committee.\n1. SPIO nanoparticle synthesis\nPrepare dextran-coated iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles by vigorously stirring a mixture of dextran T-40 (5 mL; 50% w/w) and aqueous FeCl3×6H2O (0.45 g; 2.77 mmol) and FeCl2×4H2O (0.32 g; 2.52 mmol) solutions at room temperature.\nAdd NH4OH (10 mL; 7.5% v/v) rapidly.\nFurther stir the black suspension for 1 h; subsequently, centrifuge at 17,300 x g for 10 min and then remove the aggregates.\nSeparate the final SPIO products from unbound dextran T-40 by gel filtration chromatography20.\nLoad the reaction mixture (total volume = 5 mL) into a 2.5 cm × 33 cm column and elute with a buffer solution containing 0.1 M Na acetate and 0.15 M NaCl at pH 7.0.\nCollect the purified dextran-coated iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles in the void volume and assay the column eluates for iron and dextran at 330 and 490 nm by using hydrochloric acid and the phenol/sulfuric acid methods20, respectively.\n2. SPIO-MtbsAb synthesis\nSynthesize SPIO-conjugated EDBE using previously reported methods21,22.\nSynthesize SPIO-EDBE-succinic anhydride (SA).\n\t\nStir an alkaline solution (5 M NaOH; 10 mL)) of SPIO-EDBE and SA (1 g; 10 µmol) at room temperature for 24 h.\nDialyze the solution with 20 changes of 2 L of distilled water using molecular porous membrane tubing (12,000-14,000 MW cutoff). 6 h for each change.\nFinally, add 100 μL of SPIO-EDBE-SA (4 mg/mL of Fe) to 400 μL of 4.5 mg/mL MtbsAb to synthesize SPIO-MtbsAb by using 1-hydroxybenzotriazole and (benzotriazol-1-yloxy) tripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate as catalysts and stir the solution at room temperature for 24 h.",
    "Finally, separate the solutions from the unbound antibody through gel filtration chromatography.\nLoad the reaction mixture (5 mL) on 2.5 cm × 33 cm column and elute using a PBS buffer. Confirm Ab–nanoparticle complex (i.e., nanoprobe) using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit23.\n3. Particle morphology observation and relaxation tier measurement\nExamine average particle size, morphology, and size distribution using transmission electron microscope at a voltage of 100 kV.\n\t\nDrop-cast the composite dispersion onto a 200-mesh copper grid and air dry at room temperature before loading it onto the microscope.\nMeasure the relaxation time values (T1 and T2) of the nanoprobes using the NMR relaxometer at 20 MHz and 37.0 °C ± 0.1 °C.\n\t\nCalibrate the relaxometer before each measurement.\nRecord the r1 and r2 values from the eight data points generated through inversion-recovery and the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill pulse sequence, respectively, to determine r1 and r2 relaxivities20.\n4. Cell imaging\nCultivate human monocytes THP-1 in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 µg/mL gentamycin sulfate, 100 units/mL penicillin G sodium, 100 µg of streptomycin sulfate, and 0.25 µg/mL fungizone in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C.\nIncubate SPIO-MtbsAb nanoprobes (2 mM) with 106 colony forming units (CFU) of Mycobacterium bovis BCG preincubated with 1 × 107 activated monocytes in microcentrifuge tubes (1 mL) in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 1 h.\nCentrifuge tubes at 200 x g and discard the supernatant. Redissolve pellets in the medium (200 µL).\nScan the samples using a fast gradient echo pulse sequence (Repetition time (TR) = 500; Echo time(TE) = 20; Flip angle = 10°) through 3.0-T MRI to determine the nanoprobe's specificity and sensitivity21,22.\n5. BCG (Bacillus Calmette–Guérin) inoculation",
    "Reconstitute the lyophilized vaccine or bacterial stock in Sauton's medium and then dilute the stock with saline until properly dispersed as previously described24.\nInoculate a live attenuated strain of M. bovis BCG, obtained from ADIMMUNE (Taipei, Taiwan) (Connaught strain; ImmuCyst Aventis, Pasteur Mérieux) at a volume of 0.1 mL/mouse (i.e., 107 CFU) intradermally into the left or right dorsal scapular skin of mice, as described previously23. Inject saline into mice as negative control. Monitor animals daily after BCG inoculation.\nSacrifice animals 1 month after bacteria inoculation using carbon dioxide euthanasia. Harvest the tissue from the intradermal inoculation site. Fix the tissue in 10% formalin and embed in paraffin for serial sections at 5-10 µm. Stain tissue sections with the hematoxylin/eosin and Ziehl-Neelsen stains for acid-fast bacteria24 and with Berlin blue for ferric iron25.\n6. In vivo MRI\nInject ketamine (80 mg/kg of body weight) and xylazine (12 mg/kg body weight) subcutaneously into mice for animal anesthesia.\nInject SPIO-TbsAb probes (2 nmol/200 µL) into tail veins of mice. MR image mice before and immediately after probe injection and then every 5 min for 30 min to acquire T2-weighted fast spin-echo images (TR = 3000; TE = 90; field of view = 8).\nQuantitatively analyze all MR images using signal intensity (SI), a measurement of defined regions of interest in comparable locations of an Mtb granuloma center and the back muscle adjacent to a granulomatous area.\nCalculate relative signal enhancements using the SI measurement before (SIpre; control) and 0-3 h after (SIpost) injection of the contrast agents using the formula\n\t[(SIpost - SIpre)/SIpre] × 100\n\twhere SIpre is the SI of the lesion on the pre-enhanced scan and SIpost is the SI of the lesion on the post-enhanced scan21,22.\nSubscription Required.
