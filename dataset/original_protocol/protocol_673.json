Wash cells with PBS \\(-/-)\n  3. Detach cells using trypsin \\(e.g. HeLa/U2OS) or accutase \\(e.g. NHEKs)\n  4. Add an equal amount of complete growth medium to the detached cells\n  5. Transfer cells to a Falcon tube and centrifuge at 1300 rpm for 5 min at room temperature to pellet the cells\n  6. Remove the supernatant, re-suspend cells in complete medium and count\n  7. Make a single cell suspension \\(by pipetting up and down 10 times) of 1 million cells/1.5 mL in DMEM 10 % FBS \\(maximum of 25 million cells / 50 mL Falcon tube)\n  8.

Centrifuge cells at 1200 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C with the break switched off\n  14. Remove the supernatant, tap tube against hand to loosen the pellet and add ice cold PBS \\(same volume as was removed)\n  Note: we suggest loosening pellet by tapping, rather than re-suspending using pipettes, to avoid loss of material.\n15. Invert tube 5 times",
    "16. Centrifuge the cells at 1200 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C with the break switched off\n  17. Remove the supernatant, tap tube against hand to loosen the pellet and add ice cold PBS \\(same volume as was removed)\n  18.

Add chilled 1 × NEBuffer 2 \\(see reagents) + 0.1 % Triton X-100 \\(freshly added) so that the final volume in the tube is equivalent to 10 million cells/mL",
    "32. Re-suspend by pipetting up and down and transfer nuclei to 2 ml Eppendorf tubes \\(10 million nuclei/tube i.e. 1 mL/tube)\n  Note: familiarise yourself with steps 33-35 before proceeding.\n33. Place samples on ice and add Proteinase K \\(20 mg/ml) to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml \n  34. Vortex samples briefly at minimum power and then incubate for 8 minutes at 37 °C in a water bath\n  35. Work quickly: Place samples on ice and immediately add an equal volume of NEBuffer 2 + 0.1 % Triton X-100 \\(freshly added) + 1:50 PMSF \\(freshly added; filter buffer through 0.2 μm filter before adding)\n  36. Invert tubes to mix \n  Note: now that cells are in 2 ml Eppendorf tubes centrifuge samples in a bench top microcentrifuge \\(e.g. Eppendorf 5415R).",
    "Critical steps applying to all centrifugation steps until the nuclei are lysed: the pellet may not be visible in the tube by eye. Centrifuge with the hinge of the Eppendorf tube facing outwards so that the pellet will accumulate against the wall of the tube at the side with the hinge. Knowing the position of the pellet carefully remove as much of the supernatant as possible \\(approximately 50 μL can be left behind). If the pellet is accidentally removed it may be visible in the pipette tip. Do not discard the supernatant, but transfer it to another Eppendorf tube. Check the supernatant for nuclei \\(see below) – if the supernatant contains nuclei, centrifuge the supernatant again with a spin speed 1000 g greater than the indicated spin speed. Remove the supernatant and add the recovered nuclei back to the original tube \\(this is most easily done by adding the wash buffer or reaction buffer for the subsequent step to the pelleted nuclei and then transferring the nuclei/buffer solution back the original tube. Also make sure that the supernatant from this repeated centrifugation step is free from nuclei. Different cell types behave differently during the centrifugation steps and thus require slightly different spin-speeds. It is important not to loose material during the wash steps so we recommend checking the supernatant for nuclei after each centrifugation step and to re-centrifuge if necessary. Checking for nuclei: mix 10 μL of supernatant with 10 μL trypan blue and visualise nuclei using a light microscope. We use Ibidi slides to aid this process.  \n37.

Perform PCR: each 25 μl sample will make up 5 reactions\n  Note: Multiple PCR R \\(reverse) primers are available \\(see end of protocol).

If multiple samples will be sequenced together in one sequencing reaction ensure that each sample is amplified with a different PCR R primer. Ensure to record the AD number of the primer used to amplify each sample.
