  "procedures": [
    "1. Design of crRNA\nDesign two crRNAs, one 5' and the other 3' of the target CRE using a web-based CRISPR design tool28,29,30,31. Ensure that a PAM of NGG is located immediately downstream of the target sequence for Cas9 recognition. The design of the two crRNAs (crRNA-1 and crRNA-2) for the deletion of the RUNX1 silencer18 is shown in Figure 1.\nNOTE: A crRNA typically contains a 20-mer protospacer that is complementary to the target sequence.\nCheck the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)/indels in the target and adjacent PAM sequences by entering the genomic locations of the sequences into the search box of an online genome browser (e.g., NCBI 1000 Genomes or UCSC Genome Browser).\nNOTE: Common SNPs/indels have a minor allele frequency of at least 1% in the general population.\nSubmit the selected crRNA sequences for synthesis with a commercial vendor. Also, purchase the tracrRNA for gRNA duplex formation.\n2. Design of Deletion Screening Primers\nDesign a pair of primers that flank the intended deletion region. Ensure that the primers are at least 50 bp from the Cas9 cleavage sites so that PCR amplification is minimally affected by indels formed at the cleavage sites.\nEnsure that the amplicon is smaller than 1,200 bp (preferably smaller than 600 bp for better size resolution). Also, label one of the primers with a fluorescent dye (e.g., 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM)) at the 5'-end for the detection. The primers used for screening of the RUNX1 silencer deletion18 are shown in Figure 1.\n3. Preparation of Cas9/gRNA RNP Complexes\nResuspend the crRNAs and tracrRNA in 1x TE buffer (10 mM Tris, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) to a final concentration of 200 µM.",
    "For each crRNA, mix 2.2 µL of 200 µM crRNA, 2.2 µL of 200 µM tracrRNA and 5.6 µL of 1x TE buffer (total 10 µL) in a 0.2 mL tube to obtain a final duplex concentration of 44 µM.\nIncubate at 95 °C for 5 min in a thermocycler. Allow the tubes to cool to room temperature for gRNA complex formation.\nDilute 10.4 µL of 62 µM recombinant Cas9 nuclease with 7.6 µL of 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to obtain a final nuclease concentration of 36 µM.\nNOTE: This amount is sufficient for the preparation of two Cas9/gRNA complexes.\nMix equal volumes (8.5 µL) of the diluted nuclease with each of the gRNA duplexes obtained from step 3.3.\nIncubate at room temperature for 20 min to allow RNP complex formation. Keep the mixtures on ice until electroporation.\n4. Electroporation of the RNP Complexes into OCI-AML3 Cells\nCulture OCI-AML3 cells in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1x GlutaMAX, 100 units/mL of penicillin and 100 µg/mL of streptomycin (hereafter referred to as complete RPMI 1640 medium) at 37 °C with 5 % CO2.\nCount cells using trypan blue staining. Ensure that the cell viability at the time of electroporation is over 90%.\nCentrifuge 2.5 x 106 cells in a 1.5 mL tube at 500 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Remove the supernatant and wash the cells with 1 mL of 1x PBS. Spin down the cells again and remove all residual supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in 163 µL of RPMI 1640 medium without phenol red.  Add 16.7 µL of each RNP complex (from step 3.6) and 3.6 µL of 100 µM Electroporation Enhancer to the cells (total volume = 200 µL). Mix gently by pipetting.",
    "NOTE: The Electroporation Enhancer is a carrier DNA for enhancing the editing efficiency.\nTransfer the mixture to a 0.2 cm-gap electroporation cuvette without any bubbles. Perform electroporation with an electroporation system (Mode: exponential; Voltage =: 150 V; Capacitance = 700 µF; Resistance = 50 Ω).\nTransfer the cells to a T-25 tissue culture flask containing 6 mL of complete RPMI 1640 medium and incubate at 37 °C with 5 % CO2.\n5. Screening and Selection of Cell Clones with Biallelic Deletions\nDilute the cells to 5 x 103/mL in complete RPMI 1640 medium one day after electroporation. Add 100 µL of the diluted cell suspension into each well of 96-well tissue culture plates and allow the cells to grow for 7-14 days.\nExtract genomic DNA from the cells using a high-throughput purification system.\nAdd 100 µL of plate binding and lysis buffer to each well of a 96-well extraction plate. Add 5 x 104 cells resuspended in 10 µL of 1x PBS to the buffer and mix them by pipetting.\nIncubate at room temperature for 30 min to allow binding of genomic DNA to the wells.\nAspirate the solution from the wells without scraping the well surfaces. Wash the wells with 120 µL of wash buffer.\nAir dry the wells containing the bound DNA.\nPrepare 20 µL of PCR mix (2 µL of 10x High Fidelity buffer, 0.8 µL of 50 mM MgSO4, 0.4 µL of 10 mM dNTPs, 0.4 µL of 10 µM FAM-labeled forward primer (step 2.2), 0.4 µL of 10 µM unlabeled reverse primer and 0.4 U of Taq DNA polymerase for each sample).\nNOTE: Prepare a master mix to ensure the addition of standardized amounts of reagents in each sample.",
    "Add the PCR mix to each well of the extraction plate and run the reactions in a thermocycler (Conditions: initial 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 56 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 1 min).\nEstimate the amount of the products by measuring their concentrations in a selected number of samples using a fluorometer. Dilute all samples with nuclease-free H2O to 0.5 ng/µL.\nMix 1 µL of the diluted PCR products with 8.5 µL of deionized formamide and 0.5 µL of fluorescent dye-labeled size standard in a 96-well plate compatible with the genetic analyzer.\nNOTE: Prepare a master mix containing deionized formamide and the size standard.\nCover the plate with a plate septa and denature the samples at 95 °C for 3 min in a thermocycler. Do not close the lid of the machine.\nPerform capillary gel electrophoresis to separate the labeled PCR products as previously described32.\nAfter electrophoresis, open the analysis software to analyze the results.\nClick New Project and select Microsatellite. Then click OK.\nClick Add Samples to Project and select the result files (contain the .fsa extension). Then click Add to list to import the files.\nIn the table showing the selected result files, choose Microsatellite Default in the Analysis Method column. Also, select the size standard used in the Size Standard column. Then click the Analyze icon, enter the experiment name and save the experiment.\nClick Display Plots to view the results and choose Fragment Analysis in the plot setting.\nChoose the appropriate colored channels for analysis. Check the orange icon to view the labeled fragments in the size standard to assess the quality of size calling.",
    "Check the blue icon to view the labeled PCR products. Identify the peaks that correspond to the wild-type and mutant (i.e., bearing the expected deletions) products. Estimate the mutant level in each sample by dividing the area under the mutant peak by the sum of the area under the wild-type and mutant peaks.\nSelect multiple cell pools with high levels of the expected deletions for further serial dilutions.\nRepeat the DNA extraction, fluorescent PCR and capillary electrophoresis steps. Select cell clones with mutant levels >95% representing biallelic deletions for subsequent analyses.\nVerify the identity of the deletions in the selected clones by Sanger sequencing.\n6. Functional Analyses of the Silencer Deletion by Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis\nExtract total RNA from the selected clones and perform complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis.\nMix 1 µg of RNA with 1 µL of 50 µM oligo(dT)20 primer and 1 µL of 10 mM dNTP mix in a total volume of 10 µL. Incubate at 65 °C for 5 min and then place on ice for at least 1 min.\nAdd 10 µL of cDNA synthesis mix containing 2 µL of 10x RT buffer, 4 µL of 25 mM MgCl2, 2 µL of 0.1 M DTT, 1 µL of RNase inhibitor (40 U/µL) and 1 µL of reverse transcriptase (200 U/µL). Incubate at 50 °C for 50 min and then 85 °C for 5 min in a thermocycler.\nNOTE: Prepare a master mix for the reverse transcription.\nChill the samples on ice. Add 1 µL of RNase H and incubate at 37 °C for 20 min. Store the cDNA at -20 °C.\nDesign primers and TaqMan probes that specifically recognize individual transcript variants generated from alternative promoters.\nNOTE: Pre-designed transcript-specific primer/probe sets are commercially available.",
    "Clone DNA fragments containing the specific transcript sequences into plasmid DNA. Prepare a 10-fold dilution series (106 to 10 copies) of the recombinant plasmids as standard curves for transcript quantification.\nPrepare 20 µL of PCR mix (0.5 µL of DNA template, 1 µL of 20x pre-designed TaqMan probe/primer assay and 10 µL of 2x TaqMan PCR Master Mix) for each sample (both cDNA and plasmid standards). Measure each sample in triplicate.\nNOTE: Prepare a master mix for the real-time PCR.\nRun the reactions in a real-time PCR machine (Conditions: initial 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min).\nAfter the amplification, click the Analyze icon in the software to analyze the data. Check the slope and the correlation coefficient of the standard curves to evaluate the efficiency and linearity of the reactions. Ensure that the slopes are between -3.1 and -3.6 and correlation coefficients are greater than 0.99.\nNormalize the copy number of the target transcripts in each sample with a housekeeping gene (e.g., GAPDH)."
