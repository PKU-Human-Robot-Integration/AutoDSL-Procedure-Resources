    "1. Preparation of Agar Injection Plates (Time: 45 min)\nBoil 2% to 3% agarose in E3 media and allow solution to cool slightly on bench. Note: The number of injection plates being prepared dictates the amount of agarose required. Each injection plate needs approximately 35 ml of the agarose solution.\nAfter boiling, allow the agarose to cool until desired temperature is reached (e.g., 45 °C) as per the injection mold manufacturer’s instructions.\nPour approximately 35 ml of the cooled agarose into a 100 mm dish.\nPlace one end of preferred injection mold into solution, then lay remainder of mold onto agarose solution (this will help reduce the occurrence of air bubbles).\nAllow the agarose solution to solidify either at RT or 4 °C for approximately 30 min.\nUse a spatula to separate one end of the mold from the solid agarose. Slowly remove the remainder of the mold.\n2. Preparation of Evans Blue Dye (EBD) Injection Mix (Time: 30 min)\nMake a 1% stock of EBD in 1X Ringer’s solution (155 mM NaCl; 5 mM KCl; 2 mM CaCl2; 1 mM MgCl2; 2 mM Na2HPO4; 10 mM HEPES; 10 mM glucose; pH to 7.2), which can be stored at RT.\nMake a stock solution of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran MW 10,000 kDa at 25 mg/mL in 1X Ringer’s solution and store at -20 °C.\nPrepare injection mix by diluting EBD to 0.1% directly in stock solution of FITC-dextran stock (i.e., for a final working volume of 100 µl: Mix 10 µl of 1% EBD in 90 µl of FITC dextran stock).\nThoroughly vortex injection mix (it should turn green) and keep out of direct light by wrapping injection mix tube in aluminum foil.\n3. EBD Injection Preparation (Time: Approximately 30 min)",
    "Note: Protocol works best with larvae from 3-7 days post fertilization (dpf).\nPre-warm injection plate to RT.\nSet up injection apparatus by arranging micromanipulator on metal plate and stand next to the microscope being used for injection. Turn on air driven microinjection controller. Note: The preferred injection system will vary by lab and should not change outcome of analysis.\nBack fill injection needle with approximately 2-4 µl of EBD mix.\nCalibrate injection volume to approximately 5 nl of EBD mix. Note: Injection volume calibration will depend on calibration method. A piston driven injection can be directly set to a given injection volume whereas gas pressure injectors will need the injection volume calibrated via volume bolus with the use of a micrometer.\nWet injection plate with 1X Ringer’s solution and remove excess from wells.\nPre-treat larvae with 0.04% ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate salt (tricaine) diluted in 1X Ringer’s solution to immobilize larvae prior to the start of injection. Note: Ensuring larvae are completely immotile is important as proper injection is difficult with any residual movement.\nPlace anaesthetized larvae into wells of the agar injection plates using a glass pipette. Ensure that the larvae are completely within the well and lying on their side. Note: The number of larvae per well is up to the experimenter.\nAfter larvae are put in the wells, remove excess Ringer’s solution to minimize larvae movement within the well. Leave a residual amount of solution so that larvae do not dehydrate.\n4. Pericardial Injection of Zebrafish Larvae with EBD (Time: Dependent on number of larvae injecting, estimated 1-3 hr)\nPlace the injection plate containing the larvae on a dissecting scope where the injections will be performed.\nPosition the injection pipette needle containing the EBD mix over a zebrafish larvae.",
    "Re-position the injection plate by rotating it so the injection needle is near the larvae’s heart and approximately 45° ventrally from the anterior-posterior axis.\nInsert the injection needle into the common cardinal vein (CCV) in the region of the vein at the anterior portion of the yolk where the vein is initially turning in the dorsal direction (Figure 1). Note: A magnification of up to 40x may be useful to clearly see the CCV.\nInject 5 nl of EBD mix and keep injection needle in position for 5-8 sec to minimize immediate leakage of EBD mix. Note: A good injection will have dye coloration seen in the heart chambers (Figure 1). If EBD mix is not observed in the heart, then injecting an additional 5 nl of EBD mix may be sufficient to induce dye uptake. Alternatively, the embryo can be discarded.\n\tNote: In some situations, the heart may stop beating. If this occurs, continue to monitor the larvae for 20-40 sec. Typically, the heart resumes beating as the dye moves through the circulatory system.\nMove onto the next larvae and repeat.\nIdentify successfully injected embryos by observing the presence of FITC-dextran in the vasculature immediately after injection (Figure 2).\n5. Incubation and EBD Uptake (Time: 4-6 hr)\nAfter the desired number of larvae are injected, return injected larvae to 1X Ringer’s solution without tricaine in 100 mm dishes.\nKeep dishes wrapped in aluminum foil. Note: Keeping injected larvae in the dark significantly increases survival rates and ensures the greatest consistency in signal strength. Wrapping in aluminum foil is especially important for the period of time that the larvae are outside of the incubator.\nAllow larvae to incubate at 28.5 °C for 4-6 hr to ensure sufficient EBD uptake.",
    "6. Visualization of EBD in the Muscle (Time: Dependent on number of larvae injecting and type of microscopy, estimated 0.5-3 hr)\nPrior to imaging, anesthetize the larvae with 0.04% tricaine to prevent movement.\nView larvae under red fluorescence to determine if EBD uptake is occurring in the skeletal muscle (Figure 3)."
