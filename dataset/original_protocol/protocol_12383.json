    "NOTE: All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the German law and were approved by the government offices in Tübingen.\n1. Preparation of Micropipettes, Solutions and Membranes\nPreparation of Micropipettes\n\t\nPull glass micropipettes using a micropipette puller with the following program: Heat: 540, Pull: 125, Velocity: 20 and Delay: 140. The needle length amounts to 5.5 cm.\nBevel needles using a microgrinder to obtain a suitable tip size of 4 mm. Store the needles in a box or 15 cm Petri dish to prevent damaging of the tips.\nPreparation of Solutions\n\t\nPlasmid DNA Solution\n\t\t\nPrepare plasmid DNA containing the desired cDNA construct using an Endotoxin free Maxi-prep kit according to manufacturer’s protocol.\nAdjust plasmid DNA solution to a final concentration of 3 µg/µl (without GFP spike vector) or 4 µg/µl (with 1 µg of GFP spike vector) in endotoxin free Tris-EDTA buffer containing Fast Green (final concentration 0.05%).\nLaminin Stock solution\n\t\t\nDissolve 1 mg of laminin in sterile water to a final volume of 1 ml. Prepare 100 µl aliquots and store at -80 °C.\nPoly-L-Lysine Stock Solution\n\t\t\nDissolve 50 mg of poly-L-lysine in 50 ml of sterile water to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Prepare 1 ml aliquots and store in -20 °C.\nComplete Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (Complete HBSS)\n\t\t\nPrepare Complete HBSS by combining 100 ml of 10x HBSS, 2.5 ml of 1 M HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), 30 ml of 1 M D-glucose, 10 ml of 100 mM CaCl2, 10 ml of 100 mM MgSO4, and 4 ml of 1 M NaHCO3. Add sterile water up to 1 L and store at 4 °C.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Autoclave all solutions expect 1 M HEPES buffer and 1 M D-glucose, which are filter sterilized.\nSlice Culture Medium",
    "Prepare slice culture medium by adding 35 ml of Basal Medium Eagle, 12.9 ml of complete HBSS (1.2.4), 1.35 ml of 1 M D-glucose, 250 µl of 200 mM L-glutamine, and 500 µl of penicillin-streptomycin to obtain a final volume of 50 ml. Add horse serum to a final concentration of 5% and store at 4 °C.\nLow-Melting Point (LMP) Agarose\n\t\t\nPrepare a 4% LMP agarose solution by adding 2 g of LMP agarose to 50 ml of complete HBSS (1.2.4) followed by heating in a microwave for 1-2 min at high power. Keep this solution in a water bath at 37 – 39 °C. Store the solution at 4 °C and reuse.\nParaformaldehyde Solution\n\t\t\nIn a fume hood prepare a 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution by adding 4 g of paraformaldehyde to 100 ml of 1x PBS. Heat the solution to 60 °C and add a few drops of 1 N NaOH until the solution becomes clear.\nPermeabilization Solution\n\t\t\nDissolve 9 g of BSA in 300 ml of 1x PBS containing 0.3% Trition X-100 and store at 4 °C. Add 10% sodium azide for long term storage.\nCoating of Membrane Inserts\n\t\nDilute one aliquot of laminin stock solution (1.2.2) and one aliquot of poly-L-lysine stock solution (1.2.3) in sterile water to a final volume of 12 ml.\nPlace membrane inserts into 6 well plates with each well containing 2 ml of sterile water. Add 1 ml of coating solution on top of the membrane and incubate O/N at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nAfter incubation wash the membrane inserts three times with 1 ml of sterile water and dry. Use coated membrane inserts on the same day or store at 4 °C for up to four weeks in a dry 6 well plate.",
    "2. DNA Injection and Electroporation of E15.5 and E18.5 Embryos\nAnesthetize a time mated female mouse by placing it into an anesthetizing chamber saturated with 5% isoflurane and connected to a vaporizer. Circulate isoflurane and oxygen at a rate of 1 L/min. Keep the animal in the box for 2-4 min or until unconscious which is tested by pinching between the paws of the mouse.\nEuthanize the unconscious mouse by cervical dislocation on embryonic day (E) 15.5 or 18.5. Dissect the uterus containing the embryos13 and place it into a Petri dish containing 15-20 ml of cold complete HBSS.\n\tNOTE: From this point onwards, keep the embryos and tissues on ice.\nUse a pair of scissors to separate each embryo from the uterine horn and place into a second Petri dish containing cold complete HBSS.\nUnder a dissecting microscope, sever the uterine muscle wall and the placenta using a pair of fine forceps (#55) and scissors. Carefully release the embryo from the yolk sac.\nUse a pair of Bonn scissors to decapitate the embryos just above the forelimbs at a 60° angle. If the experiment requires genotyping of the embryos, collect a tissue sample for genomic DNA isolation (a small piece of tail).\nTransfer the head to a clean and dry Petri dish. Because the head had been decapitated in a 60° angle, the head should tilt to one side when placed dorsal side up.",
    "Place a needle carefully into the middle of the hemisphere close to the bregma (Figure 1A, B). Inject approximately 2-3 µl (at 3 or 4 µg/µl) of DNA solution by stepping on the pedal of the picospritzer III using 30 pounds of pressure for the duration of 10-15 msec per pulse, applying 5-8 pulses. The duration and number of the pulses depends on the diameter of the needle opening with smaller openings requiring more time. The interval between each pulse amounts to 1 sec.\nBefore placing the electrodes, apply a few drops of complete HBSS on the head of the embryo. Place the electrodes in such a way that the ‘negative’ terminal is on the same side as the injected ventricle and the ‘positive’ electrode on the opposite side of the injected ventricle below the ear of the embryo’s head (Figure 1C, D). Apply 5 pulses of 50 V.\n\t\nUse 3 mm electrodes for E 15.5 and 5 mm electrodes for E 18.5.\n3. Dissection of the Brain\nAfter the electroporation, peel off the skin from the head with the help of a pair of fine forceps. Using a pair of spring scissors make a small incision in the middle of the cerebellum at the midline of the skull.\nInsert the spring scissors into the incision and cut longitudinally along the sagittal suture. Peel off the skull and detach the brain from the skull by using fine forceps. Transfer the whole brain into 15-20 ml cold complete HBSS solution.\nMeanwhile, pour 4% LMP agarose, kept at 37-39 °C in a water bath, into a peel-away mold.\nTake the brain out of the complete HBSS by a small scoop spatula and drain excess of HBSS by using fine tissue paper or Kimwipes.",
    "Place the whole brain gently into the agarose and adjust its position with a fine needle. Keep the mold on ice until the agarose is solidified and the block is sectioned (for coronal sections the olfactory bulbs point up).\n4. Vibratome Sectioning and Slice Culture\nTrim the LMP agarose blocks and glue them to the specimen stage using ‘super glue’. After the glue is dry transfer the specimen stage to the buffer tray of the vibratome and fill with ice cold complete HBSS until the block is immersed in the solution.\n\tNOTE: Sterilize all instrument and equipment surfaces with 70% ethanol before sectioning.\nPrepare 250 µm thick vibratome sections using a new blade as followed.\n\t\nTrim the block with the following settings; frequency – 60 Hz, amplitude – 0.7 µm, speed 16-18 mm/sec. Cut the sections containing the desired tissue with the above settings at slow speed (9 mm/sec). Starting the sectioning from the hindbrain, collect 5-7 sections from the cerebrum.\nTransfer the sections to a clean 6 well culture dish containing 5 ml of ice cold complete HBSS with the help of a bent spatula and keep on ice till all the sections are collected (Figure 1E).\nMoisten the membrane in a cross fashion with 100 µl of complete HBSS before placing the sections on the membrane, to facilitate the orientation of the sections.\nTransfer the sections using a bent spatula onto the membrane (pick up a corner of the section with forceps and pull onto the spatula and then use the forceps to push the section onto the membrane). Place up to five sections on one membrane and arrange by using forceps (Figure 1F). Do not overlap the sections with each other.",
    "Take the excess of HBSS off the membrane using a pipette. The specific membranes used here are attached to a frame and inserted into the tissue culture plate, which allows the tissue to be in contact but not covered by the medium.\nPlace the membrane inserts into a 6 well plate containing 1.8 ml of slice culture medium (1.2.5) (Figure 1G, H). Incubate the culture dish at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 11 DIV or 14 DIV. Change half the medium (0.9 ml) every second day.\n\tNOTE: At this stage, add reagents like Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU; 10 µM final concentration) for labeling proliferating cells to the media for the first 20 hr of the culture time.\n5. Fixation of the Sections Followed by Immunofluorescence Staining\nUse a clean and sharp scalpel blade to cut and trim the membranes depending on the orientation of the sections.\nTransfer the sections along with the membrane to a 24 well plate containing 1 ml of 4% PFA (1.2.7). Incubate the sections for 1 hr at RT followed by 3 washes with 1x PBS for 15 min each. Incubate the sections O/N with permeabilization solution at 4 °C with gentle agitation.\nThe following day, incubate the sections with appropriate primary antibodies, diluted in permeabilization solution, O/N or for 48 hr at 4 °C with gentle agitation.\nWash the sections 3 times for 15 min with 1x PBS and incubate O/N at 4 °C with the appropriate secondary antibodies diluted in permeabilization solution.\nAfter the incubation with secondary antibodies, wash the sections once with 1x PBS for 15 min followed by DAPI staining for 10 min.",
    "Wash the sections 3 times with 1x PBS for 15 min each and transfer to microscope slides. Add ImmunoMount and gently place a coverslip on top of the sections. Dry the slides O/N at 4 °C and seal with nail polish.\n\tNOTE: Keep the slides always at 4 °C.\n\t\nAnalyze the slice cultures by confocal microscopy (Figure 1I).\nSubscription Required.
