    "Animal studies were performed in accordance with the University of Campinas Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (protocol CEUA #5810-1/2021).\n1. Molecular cloning\nDesign of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs)\n\t\nDesign sgRNAs for CRISPR activation using CHOPCHOP, available at https://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/, or any other suitable tool. Use the following parameters to design sgRNA targeting the Prdm16 gene: Target: Prdm16; In: Mus musculus; Using: Crispr/Cas9; For: Activation.\n\t\tNOTE: Design sgRNAs for each region of interest spread over a 200 bp upstream transcription start site (TSS) region. For instance, the sgRNA targeting Prdm16 used in this study binds 154 bp upstream of TSS.\nAdd overhangs to the sgRNA to match the SacI restriction site in the vector backbone pAAV-U6-gRNA-CBh-mCherry (see Table of Materials). Include: 5'- (N20)AGCT-3' (N = nucleotides). For example, the sequence targeting the Prdm16 gene is 5'- CGAGCTGCGCTGAAAAGGGG-3', and with overhangs is 5'- CGAGCTGCGCTGAAAAGGGGAGCT-3'.\nObtain the 3' sgRNA reverse complement sequence using the tool available at https://arep.med.harvard.edu/labgc/adnan/projects/Utilities/revcomp.html. For example, the 3’ sgRNA sequence targeting the Prdm16 gene is 3’- TCGAGCTCGACGCGACTTTTCCCC-5’.\nAnnealing of single-stranded complementary oligonucleotides\n\t\nAdd 1 µL of each 5' and 3' single-stranded oligonucleotide (stock concentration: 100 µM), 1 µL of T4 ligase buffer, 0.5 µL of T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK) (1 × 104 units/mL), and 6.5 µL of H2O to a final reaction volume of 10 µL. Anneal the complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides using a thermocycler under the following conditions: 37 °C for 30 min and 95 °C for 5 min, followed by a ramp-down rate of 5 °C/min.",
    "​NOTE: The PNK enzyme is supplied with PNK buffer and does not contain enough ATP required for the phosphorylation reaction (see Table of Materials). To simplify the reaction, use the T4 ligase buffer (instead of PNK buffer). T4 ligase buffer provides the appropriate amount (1 mM ATP) of phosphate for the phosphorylation reaction. The PNK enzyme provides 5' end phosphorylation of oligonucleotides for the subsequent ligation reaction.\nLigation of annealed sgRNA oligonucleotides\n\t\nAdd 25 ng of plasmid pAAV-U6-gRNA-CBh-mCherry to 2 µL of annealed sgRNA oligonucleotides, 1 µL of SacI enzyme, 2 µL of 10x T4 DNA ligase buffer, 1 µL of T4 DNA ligase (1-3 u/µL) (see Table of Materials), and H2O to a final reaction volume of 10 µL.\nPerform ligation by incubating the reaction mixture using a thermocycler under the following conditions: 15 cycles of 37 °C for 5 min and 25 °C for 5 min, followed by holding at 4 °C.\nTransformation followed by colony polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\n\t\nTransform the competent E. coli DH10B cells (see Table of Materials) with 4 µL of the ligation product using heat shock (42 °C for 45 s) and spread on an agar plate containing 100 µg/mL ampicillin.",
    "Confirm transformed colonies by colony PCR using the PCR master mix (see Table of Materials). Pick the colony and mix with 5 µL of master mix, 0.1 µL of universal primer (stock concentration: 100 µM), 0.1 µL of sgRNA reverse primer (stock concentration: 100 µM) (Table 1), and 5 µL of H2O. Run the PCR using a thermocycler under the following conditions: initial denaturation (94 °C for 2 min), followed by 35 cycles of denaturation (94 °C for 20 s), annealing (60 °C for 30 s), extension (72 °C for 30 s), and a final elongation step (72 °C for 5 min). Resolve the DNA using agarose (1.5%) gel electrophoresis in 0.5x TAE buffer at 90 V for 30 min.\n\t\t​NOTE: Positive clones give a band of ~280 bp.\nSubmit positive samples for Sanger sequencing using universal primer (Table 1, Supplemental File 1).\nPlasmid purification\n\t\nPurify the plasmid from a positive clone using a plasmid purification kit (see Table of Materials), following the manufacturer's instructions.\n\t\tNOTE: Purify the plasmid using anion-exchange resin or another kit suitable for use in cell transfection.\nIncubate the positive clone (12 h at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm) using a standard bacterial growth medium containing 100 µg/mL ampicillin.\nCentrifuge the bacterial cells at 6,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Follow the next steps according to the manufacturer's kit instructions.\n2. AAV packaging\nNOTE: AAV packaging was performed according to previous publications15,16 with minor modifications.\nPlate 293T cells (see Table of Materials) in a 175 cm2 flask (seeding 5 × 106 cells per flask) using 25 mL of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S). Incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity until the cells reach 50%-70% confluence.",
    "Mix 14 µL of polyethylenimine (1 µg/µL) with 1 mL of 150 mM NaCl. Mix the three plasmids required for AAV production in a 1:1:1 molar ratio (i.e., 17.7 µg of pAdDeltaF6, 7.9 µg of AAV2/8 (see Table of Materials), and 5.9 µg of cloned sgRNA from step 1 in 1 mL of 150 mM NaCl. Transfer the polyethylenimine:NaCl mixture drop by drop to the tube containing the DNA (mixture of plasmids) and incubate for 20 min at 25 °C.\n\t​NOTE: pAdDeltaF6 is a Helper plasmid and pCapsid pAAV2/8 is a packaging plasmid expressing Replication (Rep) and Capsid (cap) genes. Both plasmids are necessary to produce AAV.\nBefore transfection, replace the cell growth medium with 18 mL of DMEM containing 1% FBS and L-alanyl-L-glutamine (0.5 g/L). Add 2 mL of the polyethylenimine:DNA mixture to each culture flask and incubate the cells in a CO2 incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity).\nAfter 5 h, add 5 mL of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and L-alanyl-L-glutamine (0.5g/L).\nAfter 3 days of incubation, detach the cells from the culture flask using a cell scraper. Collect the 293T cells from 10 (175 cm2) cell culture flasks into 50 mL conical tubes and add DMEM (see Table of Materials) up to 30 mL.\nAdd 3 mL of chloroform to each 50 mL conical tube containing the 293T cells and mix using a vortex mixer at high speed for 5 min. Resuspend the cells by adding 7.6 mL of 5 M NaCl and vortex briefly. Centrifuge at 3,000 × g and 4 °C for 5 min.",
    "Transfer the aqueous phase into a new conical tube and add 9.4 mL of 50% (v/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000. Mix with a vortex mixer at high speed for 10 s and put the samples on ice for 1 h.\nCentrifuge at 3,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. Remove the supernatant and allow the pellet to dry for 10 min.\nAdd 1.4 mL of HEPES (50 mM, pH 8) and mix for 5 min using a vortex mixer at high speed. Add 3.5 µL of 1 M MgCl2, 14 µL of DNase I (20 units/µL), and 1.4 µL of RNase A (10 µg/µL). Incubate in a 37 °C water bath for 20 min, and then transfer the samples into new 1.5 mL tubes (700 µL in each tube).\nAdd 700 µL of chloroform to each 1.5 mL tube and mix using a vortex mixer at high speed for 10 s. Centrifuge at 3,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min and transfer the aqueous phase to a new tube. Repeat this step 3x.\nEvaporate the chloroform for 30 min in a biosafety cabinet. Then, transfer 300 µL of the aqueous phase into a 0.5 mL ultra-centrifugation tube (see Table of Materials). Spin the filter at 14,000 × g at 25 °C for 5 min.Remove the flow-through and spin the filter again until the entire volume has passed through the filter.\nWash the filter by adding 300 µL of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) and mix the solutions by pipetting. Centrifuge the filter for 5 min at 14,000 × g at 25 °C. Repeat this washing step 4x.",
    "Centrifuge the filter for 8 min at 14,000 × g at 25 °C. Place the filter upside down into a new tube, and spin for 2 min at 1,000 × g at 25 °C.\n3. Titration of the AAV by qPCR\nPrepare a standard curve for AAV titration and determine the AAV titer according to the original study by Fripont et al.15.\n4. In vivo injection of AAV into the inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT)\nSeparate the surgical tools and supplies needed for surgery and sterilize them as recommended for each specific material.\nAnesthetize the mouse with 100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine by intraperitoneal injection. Confirm anesthesia by applying vigorous pressure on the paw and tail and checking for a reflex. Apply ointment to the mouse's eyes to avoid eye dryness during the surgery.\nPlace the anesthetized mouse in the supine position and shave a small area on the flanks, proximal to the hip joints for iWAT injections, with a shaver. Apply depilatory cream for 5 min. Remove residual cream with water to avoid skin burn.\nDisinfect the skin using three alternating rounds of applying antiseptic solution (povidone-iodine) on the skin with a clean gauze and 70% alcohol. Discard the gauze after each use.\nPerform a final application of an antiseptic solution on the skin. Then, make a 1-2 cm incision with sterilized scissors in the proximal area of the joints, and hold the skin open using forceps to expose the fat depot. The WAT can be found attached to the skin on both sides, extending from the beginning on the back and down toward the testis.\n\tNOTE: Use drapes to avoid contamination during surgery or suture procedures.",
    "Using forceps, through the incision, gently pull the fat depot upward to ensure the injection is at the correct location and depth.\n\tNOTE: Be careful not to remove the tissue from its original location.\nFill the microliter syringe (gauge: 33; point style: 4; angle: 12; length: 10) (see Table of Materials) with 2.5 µL (5.6 × 1010 viral genomes [VG]/µL) of the AAV (containing the sgRNA targeting the endogenous Prdm16 gene). Carefully insert the needle at a 30°-45° angle into the iWAT. Repeat the injection 5x into different locations of the tissue to homogeneously infect the whole iWAT fat pad. A total volume of 15 µL is recommended to infect the iWAT.\n\tNOTE: The depth of insertion of the syringe depends on the thickness of the fat pad deposit. Use the no-touch technique to draw up the injection.\nClose the shaved skin incision using 4/0 monofilament sutures. Place the mouse on a heat pad until consciousness is regained. Monitor the animal every 10-15 min until it fully recovers. After the animal regains consciousness, observe the locomotor profiling, which should be linear and have no signs of distress, or pain.\nPerform postoperative pain control within 48 h after surgery by administering tramadol hydrochloride (5 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 3 days (2x/day).\n\tNOTE: Watch for signs of distress and discomfort and monitor water and food intake. Give an effective dose of analgesic in a preemptive manner, preferably before or at the beginning of the surgery.\nKeep the mouse in a cage with free access to food and water during the healing period. After the healing period, proceed to euthanize the mouse. In this study, euthanasia was performed by an overdose of injectable anesthetics (intraperitoneal) from 3x the inducing dose (300-360 mg/kg ketamine hydrochloride + 30-40 mg/kg xylazine hydrochloride) followed by decapitation.",
    "​NOTE: It is strongly recommended to keep the animals housed in individual cages until fully recovered from anesthesia.\n5. In vitro differentiation of stromal vascular cells (SVFs) into beige adipocytes\nPerform isolation and plating of primary SVFs from the iWAT of AdipoSPH mice according to Aune et al.17. Seed SVFs derived from AdipoSPH mice iWAT into a 6-well plate containing complete medium (DMEM containing 3.1 g/L glucose, 0.5 g/L L-alanyl-L-glutamine, 10% FBS, and 2.5% P/S) for 1-2 h.\n\tNOTE: The SVF fraction contains a mixture of different cell types. At this step, it is not possible to define the number of seeded progenitor cells that give rise to adipocytes.\nAspirate the medium, wash the well 2x using phosphate-buffered saline (1x PBS), and replace with fresh complete medium. Incubate the cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity until the cells reach 70%-80% confluency.\nInduce differentiation (day 0) by treating the cells with the induction medium (Table 2).\n\tNOTE: The drug cocktail of the induction medium is necessary to enhance beige adipocyte differentiation and for expression of the thermogenic gene program17.\nAfter 2 days (day 2), replace the induction medium with the maintenance medium (Table 2).\nAfter 2 days (day 4), replace the maintenance medium with fresh maintenance medium (Table 2) for 2 to 3 days.\nChange the maintenance medium every 48 h until the preadipocytes are fully differentiated into adipocytes (typically 6 days after the addition of induction medium). Mature adipocytes can be observed using light microscopy, as the differentiated cells appear to be loaded with lipid droplets.\n6. In vitro AAV infection of SVFs\nNOTE: SVFs derived from AdipoSPH mice iWAT were infected with AAV-carrying sgRNA-Prdm16 as previously described by Wang et al.18 with a few modifications.",
    "Grow the cells on a 6-well culture plate with complete medium until the cells reach 70%-80% confluence, as previously described in steps 5.1-5.3.\nMix 5.6 × 1010 VG/µL of AAV-carrying sgRNA-Prdm16 with 2 mL of complete medium and hexadimethrine bromide (8 µg/mL) (see Table of Materials). Transduce the cells by replacing the complete medium and adding the complete medium containing AAV. Incubate the transduced cells for 12 h at 37 °C, 95% humidity, and 5% CO2.\nSplit and seed the cells as described in step 5 for cell proliferation and differentiation into beige adipocytes.\n\tNOTE: For the oxygen consumption assay, seed 4.0 × 104 cells (from step 6.2) per well with induction medium in a 24-well cell culture plate. The subsequent steps of cell proliferation and differentiation are performed as described in step 5. The oxygen consumption assay is performed when the cells reach 80%-100% confluence and are fully differentiated, as previously reported19.\nSubscription Required.
