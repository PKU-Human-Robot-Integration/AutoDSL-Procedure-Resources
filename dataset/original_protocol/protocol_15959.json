    "Intragastric inoculation of streptomycin-treated mice with S. Typhimurium should induce severe inflammation of the cecum and colon beginning 24 hr post-infection (Barthel et al., 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-bib-0005]). In susceptible mice (e.g., C57BL/6 mice; Simon et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-bib-0070]), significant S. Typhimurium dissemination from the gut to systemic sites can be observed during infection over time, resulting in mortality after 4-5 days (Barthel et al., 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-bib-0005]), depending on the S. Typhimurium strain, the vivarium, and the gut microbiota. In the absence of streptomycin pretreatment, susceptible mice will usually develop few intestinal signs of gastroenteritis and are considered a model for typhoid disease, given the substantial dissemination of Salmonella from the gut to systemic tissues including blood, liver, and spleen. However, in some mouse lines that display greater immunological control of systemic S. Typhimurium infection (“resistant” lines; e.g., CBA/J; Simon et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-bib-0070]), S. Typhimurium infection without antibiotic pretreatment can generate significant intestinal inflammation by around 7-10 days of infection (Faber et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-bib-0021]; Rivera-Chávez et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-bib-0062]). For a more detailed classification of mouse lines displaying resistance and susceptibility to S. Typhimurium, refer to Simon et al. (2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-bib-0070]).\nPretreatment of mice with streptomycin inhibits microbiota-associated intestinal colonization resistance against S. Typhimurium, prompting a neutrophilic inflammatory response to the pathogen in the cecum and colon (the murine colitis model) (Barthel et al., 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-bib-0005]; Bohnhoff & Miller, 1962[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-bib-0010]). In this model, antibiotic administration is performed by gavage 24 hr prior to S. Typhimurium inoculation to allow for both reduced colonization resistance and clearance of most of the antibiotic from the gastrointestinal tract prior to infection. Uninfected mice treated with streptomycin restore the microbiota by day 4 post-infection (Barthel et al., 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-bib-0005]; Stecher et al., 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-bib-0077]).

Prepare a fresh 200 mg/ml solution of streptomycin sulfate in sterile water.\nFor 8-week-old mice of ∼18-25 g body weight, prepare enough to administer 0.1 ml (20 mg) per mouse.\n2. Filter sterilize into a sterile 1.5-ml tube (e.g., autoclaved microcentrifuge tube) and keep on ice until ready to administer.\n3. Immediately before administration, flush a gavage needle with 70% ethanol and then enough sterile water to remove any residual ethanol.\nResidual ethanol in the needle can yield difficult or inaccurate gavages.\n4. Change the syringe on the gavage needle, agitate the streptomycin solution to mix evenly, and draw up an adequate volume for treatment.\n5. With the gavage needle pointing upwards, tap the syringe and depress the plunger to remove any air bubbles.\n6. Wipe the outside of the gavage needle with 70% ethanol and a Kimwipe to remove any external droplets.\n7. Scruff the first mouse firmly, hold it in an upright position, and gently insert the gavage needle down the esophagus into the stomach (i.e., intragastrically).\nCAUTION: If any resistance is felt, do not continue to push the needle in, as you may be erroneously inserting the needle down the trachea. Instead, withdraw the needle and try inserting it again.\n8. Dispense 0.1 ml streptomycin solution and gently withdraw the needle.",
    "9. Return mouse to its cage and monitor for signs of respiratory distress or abnormal behavior.\nIf irregular breathing or respiratory distress is evident, the solution may have been aspirated or the needle may have perforated the trachea, in which case the animal should be euthanized immediately.\n10. Wipe the gavage needle with 70% ethanol and a Kimwipe before repeating with the remaining mice.\n11. After the last mouse, clean and disinfect the gavage needle and work surfaces with 70% ethanol.\nThe following day, mice can be infected with S. Typhimurium.\nPerform infection\n12. Optional: Remove mouse chow from the cages 3-4 hr before inoculation.\nFasting can help limit the discomfort associated with gavage into a full stomach and may normalize differences in colonization resulting from acute variation in feeding behavior between mice.\n13. Record the weight of each mouse and identify using marker lines on the tail or ear tags.\nS. Typhimurium infection can result in rapid morbidity and mortality, so regular assessment of weight and behavior is important to limit animal suffering. IACUC protocols commonly require euthanization after a maximum 20% reduction in body weight from the start of the experiment.\n14. Prepare the inoculum (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-prot-0003] or 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-prot-0004]) at a concentration of 2.5 × 108 to 1 × 1010 CFU/ml.\nOral S. Typhimurium infection models typically use a dose of 5 × 107 to 1 × 109 total CFU per mouse in a volume of 0.1 or 0.2 ml. A high inoculum helps ensure more consistent infection dynamics between animals and experiments. Dose consistency (same CFU, same vehicle, same volume) between experiments is important.\n15. Perform gavage as in steps 3-11.\n16. If animals were fasted prior to infection, return food to their cages.",
    "17. Monitor and weigh animals at least once or twice daily to assess the course of infection.\nIntragastric S. Typhimurium infection experiments in susceptible mouse lines pretreated with streptomycin typically display peak pathology and need to be ended by 3-4 days post-infection. Resistant lines may take longer to develop significant signs of morbidity, with some animals even apparently clearing the infection.",
    "For some research questions, it is desirable to determine whether an observed phenotype depends on the intestinal or extraintestinal stage of infection (e.g., whether higher systemic levels of Salmonella are due to increased extraintestinal growth/survival or are downstream of gut-associated factors). A simple model to investigate this question is performing an infection by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, allowing Salmonella to colonize systemic tissues while bypassing the selective pressures present in the gut. If the phenotype is absent following i.p. infection, it can be concluded that the mechanism driving the phenotype involves the intestinal stage of infection.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-prot-0001])\nMice, typically 6-8 weeks old (sex-matched) and acclimated to their housing for ≥1 week\n26-G PrecisionGlide needles (Becton Dickinson)\n1. Weigh mice prior to inoculation.\nA starting weight of 18-20 g is generally optimal for the i.p. infection model and for obtaining consistent, reproducible results. This is the typical weight of mice that are 6-8 weeks old.\nS. Typhimurium infection can result in rapid morbidity and mortality, so regular assessment of behavior and weight loss is important to limit animal suffering. Most IACUC protocols recommend euthanization at 20% reduction in body weight from the start of the experiment. Endpoints often occur 2-3 days following intraperitoneal S. Typhimurium inoculation.\n2. Prepare the inoculum (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-prot-0003] or 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-prot-0004]) at a concentration of 1 × 103 to 1 × 105 CFU/ml.\nIntraperitoneal S. Typhimurium infection models typically use a dose of 1 × 103 to 1 × 104 CFU per mouse in a volume of 0.1 or 0.2 ml PBS or saline. This lower dose compared to oral models is sufficient to consistently infect systemic tissues without causing mice to succumb rapidly to septic shock. Dose consistency (same CFU, same vehicle, same volume) between experiments is important.",
    "3. Agitate the inoculum to mix evenly, then draw it up into a 1-ml syringe (at least 0.1 ml per mouse) and attach the needle.\n4. With the needle pointing upwards, tap the syringe and depress the plunger to remove any air bubbles.\n5. Wipe the outside of the needle with 70% ethanol and a Kimwipe to remove any external inoculum droplets.\n6. Scruff the mouse firmly and maneuver it underside-up, angling it away from you, with the head pointed downward at an ∼30° angle.\n7. Insert the needle ∼0.5 cm deep at an angle almost parallel to the body into the peritoneal cavity, aiming for either side between the nipples.\n8. Inject the inoculum (0.1-0.2 ml) into the peritoneal cavity and then gently withdraw the needle. Confirm that the inoculum is not expelled out of the hole left by the needle, which would indicate it was not properly inserted into the peritoneal cavity.\n9. Repeat for additional mice.\n10. Clean and disinfect the area with 70% ethanol and dispose of the syringe and needle in a biohazardous sharps disposal container.\n11. Monitor and weigh the animals at least daily to assess the course of infection.",
    "This protocol provides directions for preparing a S. Typhimurium inoculum from a frozen glycerol stock. This protocol requires 3 days.\nMaterials\n70% (v/v) ethanol, 10% bleach, or other disinfectant\nGlycerol stock (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-rec-0007]) of wild-type S. Typhimurium (e.g., strain ATCC 14028s, SL1344, or antibiotic-resistant derivative such as IR715)\nLB or MacConkey lactose agar plates (see recipes[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-rec-0004]) with appropriate selective antibiotic (50 µg/ml nalidixic acid for IR715; 100 µg/ml streptomycin for SL1344)\nLB broth (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-rec-0004])\nSterile PBS (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-rec-0006])\nInsulated culture transport vessel containing dry ice or chilled to and capable of maintaining approximately −80°C\nSterile inoculation loops (disposable plastic or reusable metal)\n37°C incubator with shaker or tube roller\n15-ml sterile test tubes with loose-fitting caps\nSpectrophotometer\nPlate cells from frozen stock\n1. Clean work surfaces with 70% ethanol, fresh 10% bleach, or another approved/compatible disinfectant.\n2. To minimize contamination, light an active flame and perform all steps within 2 feet of the flame to maintain a sterile field and limit the chance of contaminating cultures with environmental microbes.\n3. Remove a glycerol stock of S. Typhimurium from the −80°C freezer and place in an insulated cold transport vessel.\nFreeze-thaw cycles of frozen stocks kill a portion of the bacteria, so it is important to handle vials as briefly as possible to limit thawing and to keep on dry ice when not actively in use.\n4. Gently scrape the top layer of the stock with a sterile inoculation loop and run it across the top of a room-temperature LB agar plate containing selective antibiotics using the quadrant or T-streak technique to generate isolated colonies.\nFor detailed instructions on streaking techniques, refer to the recent protocol by Bouladoux et al. (2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-bib-0011]).",
    "If the S. Typhimurium strain lacks a common antibiotic resistance, it can be semi-selectively grown on MacConkey lactose agar, where it forms white (non-lactose-fermenting) colonies.\nCAUTION: Frozen stock vials are extremely cold. Consider double-gloving if you are unable to comfortably handle the frozen vial.\n5. Incubate plate upside-down in a 37°C incubator overnight (14-18 hr).\nIncubating the plates upside-down prevents condensation buildup on the lid.\nAfter overnight incubation, plates can be stored for ∼1 week at 4°C, but they are best used fresh the next day.\nPrepare overnight culture\n6. Use a sterile inoculation loop to collect a few colonies or confluent growth from the plate and transfer to a 15-ml sterile test tube containing ∼5 ml fresh LB broth. Gently rub the loop against the side of the tube in the broth, then remove the loop and cap the tube loosely.\nUsing a culture derived from a few colonies or confluent growth minimizes the chance that the entire inoculum is comprised of a stochastic mutant that exhibits attenuation. Multiple cultures derived from separate, isolated colonies is also acceptable, keeping in mind that a stochastic mutation could result in an altered phenotype.\nIf antibiotic resistance is stably maintained by the strain and if good aseptic technique is used, there is no need to prepare the liquid culture with selective antibiotics. Even if a strain is resistant to an antibiotic, growth with antibiotics can induce stress responses in the bacteria that could confound interpretation of results. That said, antibiotics should be used if a strain harbors a selectable plasmid or unstable genetic element to ensure that the element is stably maintained in the population.",
    "Different liquid growth media (e.g., low-salt LB) and/or static incubation (i.e., not aerated) are used in some protocols, depending on the growth conditions required for the experiment (e.g., favoring the expression of capsules or adhesins).\n7. Prepare a second tube with 5-ml LB broth alone as a control for contamination of the broth stock and supplies used.\n8. Incubate 12-16 hr at 37°C with aeration (shaking at ∼200 rpm or rotating).\n9. Optional: Dilute the overnight culture 1:50 (v/v) in fresh LB broth (5-50 ml total volume, depending on the amount of inoculum required) and incubate an additional 3-4 hr at 37°C with shaking.\nSubculturing helps restart logarithmic bacterial growth, which may be necessary to produce some infection results consistently, such as invasion phenotypes early in the infection model (Ibarra et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-bib-0036]; Lee & Falkow, 1990[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-bib-0045]).\n10. Measure the OD600 and calculate the required volume needed for the desired inoculum concentration (see Critical Parameters for more information on typical S. Typhimurium quantities used for inocula).\nIn general, for wild-type S. Typhimurium, an OD600 of 1.0 corresponds to an estimated bacterial concentration of ∼5 × 108 to 1 × 109 CFU/ml. It is useful to determine this empirically for a given wild-type or mutant strain by performing a growth assay and correlating OD600 values with plated CFU.\nSpectrophotometer manufacturers specify a range in which the instrument is most accurate (e.g., 0.1-1.5 absorbance units; AU). Overnight S. Typhimurium cultures are often in the range of 3-5 AU. For optimal results, cultures should be diluted in fresh growth medium as necessary to reach the instrument's prescribed measurement range (e.g., 1:2 or 1:10), and the dilutions should be factored into the calculations.\n11. Harvest bacteria by centrifuging at least 5 min at 3200 × g, 4°C, to pellet the cells. Discard the supernatant.",
    "12. Wash cells at least once by resuspending (e.g., vortex) in 5-10 ml sterile PBS. Pellet again by centrifugation and discard the supernatant.\nFor intragastric infection, the inoculum may alternately be prepared in LB broth or sodium bicarbonate solution, which may help buffer the acidic environments of the stomach and upper intestine and promote Salmonella implantation in the gut. Any of these vehicles are acceptable, but consistency across experiments is crucial.\n13. Resuspend pellet in the volume of PBS calculated to produce an inoculum at the desired concentration and use immediately (i.e., within 10 min) for infection (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-prot-0001]).\nIf the inoculum cannot be used immediately, it should be stored at 4°C or on ice and used as soon as possible (within 2 hr).\n14. Plate serial dilutions of the inoculum (typically 10–6, 10–7, 10–8, and 10–9 for an inoculum of 1 × 1010 CFU/ml) and incubate plates upside-down in a 37°C incubator overnight (14-18 hr). Count CFUs to confirm that the actual dose was close to the concentration estimated by OD600 approximation.",
    "This protocol is used to create an inoculum consisting of two different S. Typhimurium strains (typically, a wild-type and an isogenic mutant strain) that can be used for competitive fitness infection assays in vivo or in vitro. In a competitive infection experiment, the input ratio of the inoculum (i.e., strain A CFU/strain B CFU) is compared to the output ratio at the end of the infection to determine the competitive index (CI), a measure of the relative fitness advantage of one strain over another in a given environment (Beuzón & Holden, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-bib-0008]). The average CI will be equal to 1 if there is no difference in fitness between strains, >1 if strain A is more fit than strain B, and <1 if strain B is more fit than strain A.\nThis technique requires that the two strains of interest be discernible when plated, typically by using different encoded antibiotic resistances. Below, two examples are provided. Example 1 uses one strain that is nalidixic acid–resistant and streptomycin sensitive (NalR StrepS) and one that is the opposite (NalS StrepR). Example 2 uses two strains that are NalR, but one is KanS and the other is KanR. Example 2 is a common setup for comparison of wild-type and mutant strains.",
    "IMPORTANT: Be wary when using plasmids to mark strains with an antibiotic resistance for the purpose of quantification ex vivo from a host. Many commonly employed plasmids are not stably maintained within a population of cells without constant selective pressure for a bacterium to possess the plasmid (e.g., growth in an antibiotic-containing medium). As a result, the plasmid can begin to titrate out of the bacterial population (i.e., following cell division, daughter cells that do not receive a copy of an antibiotic resistance plasmid will still be able to replicate in the environment). Thus, plating on antibiotic-containing agar media selecting for the plasmid's presence would undercount the strain of interest, as some percentage of the population will have lost the plasmid. As such, an observed infection phenotype could simply be measuring loss of a marker plasmid rather than the impact of a mutation of interest, and this will be further magnified the longer the experiment runs.\nAdditional Materials (also see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-prot-0003])\nGlycerol stocks (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-rec-0007]) of two S. Typhimurium strains:\nExample 1: IR715 (NalR StrepS) and SL1344 (NalS StrepR)\nExample 2: IR715 ΔiroN::KSAC (NalR KanR) and IR715 (NalR KanS)\n1. Prepare separate inocula of both strains as described (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-prot-0003], steps 1-13). Resuspend the strains to the same concentration.\nBoth strain cultures should be prepared in liquid growth medium without antibiotics, as exposure to different antibiotics immediately prior to infection can influence the downstream competitive index.\n2. Mix the inocula 1:1 (v/v) and use immediately (i.e., within 10 min) for infection (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-prot-0001]).\nIf the inoculum is cannot be used immediately, it should be stored at 4°C or on ice and used as soon as possible (within 2 hr).",
    "3. To more accurately quantify the concentration of each strain in the inoculum (the input ratio), serially dilute and plate a sample of the mixed inoculum on separate LB agar plates supplemented with the appropriate selective antibiotics.\n         \nExample 1: If strain A is NalR and strain B is StrepR, plate the mixed inoculum on both LB/Nal and LB/Strep plates. The abundance of each strain is directly quantifiable from the colonies counted on the respective plates.\nExample 2: If strain A is NalR KanR and strain B is NalR KanS, plate the mixed inoculum on both LB/Nal and LB/Kan plates. Strain A is directly quantifiable on LB/Kan. Strain B is quantified by subtracting the LB/Kan count from the LB/Nal count.\nThe approach for example 2 is valid only in the following scenarios: (1) strain A (a mutant of strain B) is less abundant than strain B; (2) strains A and B are roughly equal in abundance; (3) strain A is at most a few-fold more abundant than strain B (i.e., one loses the ability to easily quantify strain B amidst strain A as strain A becomes relatively more abundant). In scenarios where strain A is more abundant than strain B, one may “pick and patch” several hundred colonies from each LB/Nal plate and transfer them to LB/Kan (test condition) and LB alone (positive control) in order to quantify strain B. Genetics permitting, in such a scenario, one should consider reconstructing the strains for easier quantification.\nAs the relationship between OD600 absorbance units and actual live bacterial cells can vary between strains and growth state, quantifying inoculum concentration by CFU levels of each strain provides a more accurate input ratio to assess the competitive index.",
    "4. Measure infection outcomes. Use the methods for quantifying S. Typhimurium burden in intestinal content and tissues (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-prot-0005]), while plating each sample's dilutions on both selective agars to assess the output ratio in that sample. Finally, calculate CI by dividing the output ratio by the input ratio.\nTo statistically compare the CI between groups, logarithmically transform the values to properly weight for samples with inverted competitive outcomes (CI < 1).",
    "This protocol describes methods for assessing the course of S. Typhimurium infection of mice, including the intestinal and systemic arms of infection. After orogastric infection, S. Typhimurium rapidly colonizes the mouse gut (terminal ileum, cecum, and colon). The increased levels of S. Typhimurium in the distal gut (especially in colitis models) are most readily measured over time in live mice by plating fecal samples. Feces are collected, processed and then spread on selective agar plates to assess the number of S. Typhimurium CFUs. Colonization levels are more variable in mice that are not treated with antibiotics and more consistent when mice are pretreated with streptomycin. Part 1 of this protocol provides instructions for collecting and preparing murine fecal samples and quantifying Salmonella abundance by counting CFUs. For tracking S. Typhimurium intestinal burden in live mice, fecal pellets can be collected daily.\nAt the end of infection, various terminal analyses can be performed at necropsy. Intestinal tissue from different sections (terminal ileum, colon, cecum) may be collected and homogenized to quantify S. Typhimurium levels in the gut. S. Typhimurium also colonizes Peyer's patches, intestinal lymphoid tissues that are found mostly throughout the small intestine (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-fig-0001]). Because wild-type mice are incapable of stopping S. Typhimurium from spreading beyond the intestine, measuring the S. Typhimurium burden in extraintestinal sites can help assess the relative severity of the infection in a mouse. Commonly collected tissues that display substantial S. Typhimurium extraintestinal colonization following infection by oral gavage include the mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and blood. For intraperitoneal infection, blood, spleen, and liver are typically collected. Part 2 describes each of these sample collection methods.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/bf6c811f-7fea-4a8e-8def-3058c8aff571/cpz1824-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1",

    "1. Prepare a labeled microcentrifuge tube for each infected mouse. Weigh each tube on a milligram scale and record the weight.\n2. Place a mouse on a clean paper towel and cover it with an inverted sterile glass beaker.\nMice typically produce fecal pellets within 10 min. To increase collection efficiency, additional mice may be placed under separate beakers. Collection usually takes less time in the early light cycle. Late in the infection, mice may start to eat less and the time to produce a fecal pellet can go up considerably (30 min or more). Additionally, very morbid mice may not defecate.\nA glass beaker with a pouring lip is an ideal container. A pouring lip allows air exchange and can be positioned over the mouse tail when setting down the beaker, allowing the mouse to be covered while holding the tail but not pinching it. The weight of glass will lessen the chance that the beaker moves or is tipped over. Depending on the size of the mouse, however, an additional weight may be needed on top of the beaker.\n3. Use sterile forceps to collect one to three pellets from each mouse (∼25-100 mg fecal content) into the empty tubes. Close firmly and place immediately on ice.\n4. Weigh feces-containing tubes and record the weight. Determine the weight of each sample by subtracting the empty tube weight.\n5. Add sterile PBS to each sample at a 9:1 ratio (e.g., 900 µl PBS to 100 mg feces).\nFor faster dilution, all samples can be suspended in the same volume of PBS (e.g., 1 ml) and then weight-corrected mathematically. This method has the drawback of producing a variable limit of detection for each animal when correcting for fecal weight.",
    "6. Homogenize samples into a fecal slurry by vortexing at top speed for 5-10 min.\nIf any pellets remain after homogenization, they can be broken up manually by using a sterile micropipette tip to mash them against the tube and then vortexing for an additional 5 min.\n7. Perform 10-fold serial dilutions of the fecal slurry in PBS (e.g., 100 µl slurry in 900 µl PBS), vortexing each dilution before proceeding to the next.\nThe first two serial dilutions require the use of wide-bore micropipette tips to prevent clogging. The remaining dilutions can be done with standard micropipette tips.\nThe number of 10-fold dilutions is based on the predicted CFU at a given timepoint. Typically, early infection feces (e.g., 24 hr) will have a countable number of wild-type S. Typhimurium CFUs at the 10–1, 10–2, or 10–3 dilutions, while later timepoints (e.g., 96 hr) and throughout the streptomycin-colitis model will likely require plating dilutions out to 10–6 or further.\n8. Plate the dilutions on LB agar with selective antibiotics, using wide-bore micropipette tips for the first two dilutions. Incubate the plates inverted overnight (14-16 hr) at 37°C.\nDilutions can be spread-plated as 100-200 µl samples on individual plates. Alternatively, to save plates, up to six dilutions can be plated on a single plate as multiple discrete 25-50 µl drops. Note that drop-plating may require shorter incubation times (e.g., 12-14 hr) to ensure that discrete colonies are obtained.\nStore undiluted fecal slurries at 4°C to limit growth in case additional dilutions or replating are needed.\n9. Record the number of colonies (CFUs) that form from each dilution that exhibits separate, distinct, countable colonies.",
    "For accurate counts, spread-plated samples should be counted from plates that have 30-300 discrete colonies. For drop or line plating, it will be difficult to discern more than 200 colonies per dilution due to the reduced surface area.\n10. Calculate the fecal load of S. Typhimurium in each sample as:\nFecal load (CFU/mg) = # CFUs on least-diluted countable sample / (concentration of fecal slurry × dilution × volume plated)\nFor example, if 108 CFUs were counted after plating 0.1 ml of a 10–3 dilution of a 54 mg/ml slurry, the fecal load = 108 CFU / (54 mg/ml × 10–3 × 0.1 ml) = 2 × 104 CFU/mg.\nPart 2: Quantification of S. Typhimurium loads at necropsy\nIMPORTANT: Use disinfected scissors and forceps to open the mouse and collect relevant tissues in preweighed/labeled sterile tubes. Store tissue-containing tubes on ice until they can be processed. Disinfect tools with 70% ethanol between collecting different tissues to minimize the potential of cross-contamination between samples.\n11. Prepare tubes needed for sample collection.\n         \nFor blood: Prepare a 26-G needle and 1-ml syringe for each mouse by drawing up and expelling 1 ml of sterile 0.5 M EDTA, leaving behind a residual amount as an anticoagulant. Also prepare one 1.5-ml sterile microcentrifuge tube for each mouse by adding 50 µl of 0.5 M EDTA and then weighing.\nFor intestinal content from small intestine, cecum, and colon: Label and weigh three microcentrifuge tubes for each mouse.\nFor intestinal and extraintestinal tissues: Label and weigh a sterile 15- or 50-ml polypropylene tube containing 1-5 ml sterile PBS for each tissue from each mouse.\n12. Humanely euthanize the mouse by CO2 asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation (or similar method approved in your IACUC protocol).",
    "13. Disinfect the fur and outer skin by wetting with 70% ethanol. Open the mouse using disinfected scissors and forceps.\n14. Collect tissues:\n         \nBlood: Locate the heart in the thoracic cavity and perform a cardiac puncture in either ventricle with the EDTA-treated needle. Pull the plunger back slowly to draw up blood and gently relocate the needle (without withdrawing it from the heart) to relieve pressure. Once an adequate volume has been collected (200-600 µl), remove the needle and expel the blood into the preweighed 1.5-ml tube containing EDTA.\nSpleen: Excise the spleen by blunt dissection from the left side of the body cavity. Transfer part or all of the spleen in a prepared tube.\nMesenteric lymph nodes: Locate the mesenteric lymph nodes, which look like a white translucent tube in the fatty mass adjacent to the intestines (they will often be larger/more prominent in infected animals). Dissect out the nodes and collect them in a prepared tube.\nIntestinal content/tissues: Gently move the intestines to locate the distal end of the colon. Cut the colon as distally as possible and use forceps to pull and straighten out the intestines onto a clean paper towel, being careful not to tear the organs. Separate the colon, cecum, and small intestine by cutting where they join at the cecum. Make sure to orient the tissue before cutting it, as the colon and small intestine can be hard to distinguish once cut. If the mice are pretreated with streptomycin before infection with wild-type S. Typhimurium, observe that the cecum is small, thick, whitish in color, and devoid of content (Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-fig-0001]). If luminal content is present, squeeze it out from each section and collect in prepared tubes. Collect samples of the terminal ileum, cecum, and colon tissue into separate tubes prepared with PBS.",
    "The cecum can be sectioned with scissors during necropsy for different downstream analyses (e.g., CFU counts, RNA analysis, histopathology). If performing histopathological analysis of the cecum, be sure to handle it only minimally while collecting the cecal tip (distal third to half of the cecum) for this analysis.\nPeyer's patches: The Peyer's patches can be located at various points along the small intestine, appearing as white, raised, oval spots (they will often be larger/more prominent in infected animals) (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-fig-0001]). They can be identified more easily if the intestinal content is present. Peyer's patches can be cut off the small intestine most readily using fine-tip curved dissecting scissors. For CFU assessment, the three to four most-distal Peyer's patches in the ileum from each animal may be pooled in a single prepared tube.\nDue to their small size, it is often easier to collect a consistent number of Peyer's patches (e.g., three) from each subject and then normalize CFU counts as an average per Peyer's patch rather than per milligram tissue.\nLiver: Mice have four liver lobes, which may be found immediately below the lungs, attached to the diaphragm. Cut a section of liver tissue (e.g., third to half of a lobe) and collect it in a prepared tube.\nAvoid rupturing the gallbladder (the small, yellow-to-black sack in the middle of the median liver lobe), which may contain high loads of Salmonella and can contaminate liver tissue samples if damaged.\n15. Dispose of infected mouse carcasses as biohazardous waste.\n16. Process samples:\n         \nBlood: Weigh tubes and determine the total volume of blood collected by (a) subtracting the weight of the empty tube and (b) using a blood density of ∼1 g/ml.",
    "Intestinal content: Weigh tubes and determine the weight of the collected material by subtracting the weight of the empty tubes. Homogenize intestinal content by vortexing at top speed for 5-10 min (similar to processing of fecal pellets in step 6).\nIntestinal and extraintestinal tissues: Weigh tubes and determine the tissue weight by subtracting the weight of the empty tubes. Use a homogenizer to thoroughly disrupt the tissues in their tubes with the PBS. This typically takes 3-10 s per sample tube.\nClean and disinfect the homogenizer's dispersing element between samples by running it through two washes of 70% ethanol (two separate 50-ml conical tubes containing enough ethanol to sufficiently cover the disperser) and one wash of sterile PBS. Use tweezers (disinfected with 70% ethanol) to remove any residual tissue that remains stuck in the homogenizer. Process one type of tissue at a time and change the washing media between tissues and additionally as needed.\n17. For all processed samples, perform 10-fold serial dilutions in sterile PBS and plate on appropriate selective agar as described for quantifying S. Typhimurium CFUs in feces.",
    "Non-typhoidal Salmonella colitis is characterized by the influx of inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils into the lamina propria and lumen of the gut, primarily in the cecum and colon (Barthel et al., 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-bib-0005]; Faber et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-bib-0021]; Rivera-Chávez et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-bib-0062]). In the absence of streptomycin treatment, a slowly developing mononuclear infiltrate can be observed, primarily in the small intestine (Santos et al., 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-bib-0068]). Here, we describe procedures for preservation of S. Typhimurium–infected intestinal tissues for histopathology and provide a sample rubric for quantifying inflammation in the intestine based on scoring tissues stained with hematoxylin & eosin (H&E). This scoring is most effectively performed by a trained professional (medical or veterinary pathologist), and samples should be blinded to limit potential bias in the analysis.\nMaterials\nS. Typhimurium–infected mice (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-prot-0001] or 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-prot-0002])\n70% (v/v) ethanol\n10% (v/v) neutral-buffered formalin (NBF; Fisher Scientific)\nSterile PBS (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-rec-0006])\nTissue-processing histology cassettes (Sakura Finetek)\nHistology pencil (VWR International or lead pencil)\nSterile dissecting instruments (scissors, forceps)\nDissection cutting board\nSterile Petri dishes\n20-ml syringe and 21-G needle (Becton Dickinson)\nBiopsy foam pad (Simport)\nAdditional reagents and equipment for euthanasia, paraffin embedding, sectioning, and H&E staining\n1. Assign each sample a unique ID and label histology cassettes using a histology pencil.\n2. At critical time points after infection or upon reaching a preset criterion to terminate the experiment (e.g., weight loss or morbidity), humanely euthanize mice using an approved method such as CO2 asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation.\nRecommended time points are 3-4 days post-inoculation for streptomycin-treated C57BL/6 mice, 4-8 days post-inoculation without streptomycin in susceptible mice, or 7-10 days post-inoculation in resistant mice.",
    "3. Thoroughly wet the fur with 70% ethanol and open the abdomen to dissect out the entire large intestine (cecum and colon). Separate the cecum from the colon using scissors and place immediately in a Petri dish containing 10% NBF.\nBecause tissue such as the intestine undergoes autolysis immediately post-mortem, rapid transfer of tissue into fixative is critical for optimal morphological preservation.\nWhile tissue is fixing, organs that are needed for other purposes (e.g., CFU enumeration) can be collected and handled accordingly.\nCAUTION: Formalin is a carcinogen and irritates the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract. Work under a fume hood and wear disposable gloves and eye protection.\n4. If parts of the cecum are needed for RNA or protein analysis, the cecal tip is usually sufficient for histological scoring. If the entire organ is available for histological preservation, cut open the cecum and gently flush the tissue with PBS using a syringe to remove fecal content/pus, and then carefully pat dry on a clean paper towel. Place the cecum lumen-side up onto a biopsy foam pad and transfer to a labeled histology cassette placed in the Petri dish with NBF.\n5. Cut 1-cm portions of the proximal, middle, and distal part of the colon and gently push out the luminal content using forceps. Transfer tissue pieces to a single histology cassette or to separate ones, depending the experimental design.\nDistinct anatomy of the colon and cecum can be distinguished by a trained pathologist.\n6. Fix samples in 10% NBF for at least 24-48 hr to allow for proper morphological preservation.\nFormalin fixation for at least 24 hr is sufficient to kill Salmonella. Over-fixation (>48 hr) should be avoided, as it can negatively impact tissue sectioning and analysis.",
    "7. After fixation, transfer cassettes to a container with 70% ethanol. Collect used fixative in a waste container for appropriate disposal.\nHistology cassettes may be stored long-term submerged in 70% ethanol, but must be kept in a non-flammable storage cabinet.\n8. Perform paraffin-embedding, sectioning, and H&E staining according to standard histological procedures or submit to a histology lab.\n9. Analyze H&E-stained sections on a light microscope or digital pathology scanner (e.g., Nanozoomer by Hamamatsu) to determine the extent of intestinal inflammation according to the semi-quantitative scoring scheme described in Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-tbl-0001].\nOf note, slightly different scoring systems have been reported in the literature (Barthel et al., 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-bib-0005]).\nTable 1.\n                Histopathological Parameters for Assessment of Cecal or Colonic Inflammationa[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-tbl1-note-0001_86]\ntable:\n﻿Score,Description,Area affected (extent)a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-tbl1-note-0001_87],Max total score\nMononuclear inflammation,Mononuclear inflammation,Mononuclear inflammation,Mononuclear inflammation\n0 1 2 3,Absent (normal sparse lymphocytic infiltrate) Mild (diffuse increase in LP) Moderate (LP with increased basal immune aggregates displacing crypts) Severe (LP with submucosal infiltrate),0-4,12\nNeutrophilic inflammation,Neutrophilic inflammation,Neutrophilic inflammation,Neutrophilic inflammation\n0 1 2 3,None Mild (LP only) Moderate (LP and cryptitis/crypt abscesses) Sheet-like or submucosal infiltration,0-4,12\nSubmucosal edema/width,Submucosal edema/width,Submucosal edema/width,Submucosal edema/width\n0 1 2 3,No pathological changes Mild (<50% of the diameter of the intestinal wall) Moderate (SM accounts for 50-80% of the intestinal wall diameter) Severe (SM accounts for >80% of the intestinal wall diameter),0-4,12\nEpithelial injury,Epithelial injury,Epithelial injury,Epithelial injury\n0 1 2 3,\"None Mild (crypt dropout, epithelial desquamation) Moderate (focal ulceration) Severe (multifocal or extensive ulceration)\",0-4,12\n,Total,,48",

    "1. At necropsy (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-prot-0005]), carefully remove cecal content, collect a portion of cecal tissue (∼1 cm2) into an empty cryotube, and immediately snap-freeze the tissue in liquid nitrogen.\nFor consistency, the same portion of the cecum should be collected from all mice. Frozen tissues may be stored indefinitely in a −80°C freezer for mRNA extraction.\n2. Prepare the benchtop by disinfecting with 70% ethanol and then treating with RNaseZAP to eliminate environmental RNase contamination.\n3. In a fume hood, aliquot 1 ml TRI Reagent into one 50-ml conical tube for each sample.\n4. Clean a mortar and pestle set for each sample with RNaseZAP and dry thoroughly with a Kimwipe. Cool each mortar and pestle set with liquid nitrogen until the liquid no longer evaporates.\nCAUTION: Always handle liquid nitrogen using appropriate PPE, including a face shield and cryoprotective gloves.\n5. Add tissue sample to the mortar and make a very fine powder using the pestle, adding liquid nitrogen as needed to keep everything as cold as possible.\nBe careful not to lose the tissue sample. It can be helpful to cover the mortar with a clean paper towel and a gloved hand while working it with the pestle.\n6. Condense the powdered tissue by adding liquid nitrogen and tilting the mortar as it evaporates. Gently transfer the powder to a 50-ml conical tube containing TRI Reagent (step 3) and vortex to mix.\nConical tubes with powdered tissue can be kept on ice until all of the samples have been processed to this step.\n7.

Homogenize intestinal content by vortexing (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-prot-0005], step 16b).\n4. Centrifuge 5-10 min at 10,000 × g and transfer supernatant (containing soluble inflammatory markers) to new labeled microcentrifuge tubes.\na. Samples may be stored at −80°C for later quantification.\n5. Perform ELISA according to manufacturer's instructions, diluting samples as necessary to be in the linear range of the provided standard.\n6. Correct concentration measurements to the weight of content collected for comparisons between samples.",
    "S. Typhimurium colitis is associated with the influx and activation of several cell types at the intestinal mucosa, including lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). This protocol provides directions for isolating intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs) along with associated myeloid cells and ILCs from Salmonella-infected intestinal tissues for downstream analyses including immunophenotyping by flow cytometry and ex vivo activation assays. All steps should be completed on the same day the tissues are collected.\nMaterials\nS. Typhimurium–inoculated mice (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-prot-0001] or 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-prot-0002])\nSterile PBS (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-rec-0006])\nShaking medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-rec-0009])\n1 M DTT\n0.5 M EDTA\nHarvest medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-rec-0002])\nDigest medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-rec-0001])\nIscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM, Gibco, cat. no. 21980)\nTrypan blue\nSterile Petri dishes\nWide-bore needles (18-G or larger)\n3- or 10-ml syringes (Becton Dickinson)\nSterile 50-ml conical tubes (Corning)\nTabletop shaker\nSterile 5-, 10-, and 25-ml serological pipettes\n40-, 70-, and 100-µm strainers (Corning)\n37°C incubator\nHemocytometer or automated cell counter\nAdditional reagents and equipment for collecting intestinal tissue (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-prot-0005], step 14d)\nCollect intestinal tissue\n1. Collect desired intestinal tissue (small intestine, cecum, and/or colon) and place in ice-cold sterile PBS in a sterile Petri dish.\n2. Using a wide-bore needle, flush the luminal content out of the intestine with ice-cold sterile PBS.\nOnce flushed, individual tissues can be kept in PBS on ice until all tissues are collected.\n3. Carefully remove fatty tissue adherent to the intestine.\nThis fatty tissue may contain portions of mesenteric lymph nodes, which are effectively a contaminant that will skew results.\n4. Optional: Remove Peyer's patches from small intestine.\n5. Use scissors to open the intestine longitudinally, then dice it into fragments ∼5 mm in length. Transfer to a 50-ml conical tube containing 10 ml shaking medium at room temperature.",
    "All media should contain an antibiotic/antimycotic cocktail when processing tissues from Salmonella-infected mice.\nIsolate immune cells\n6. Add 5 µl of 1 M DTT and 40 µl of 0.5 M EDTA to each tube and shake vertically on a tabletop shaker (250-300 rpm) for 10 min at room temperature.\n7. Add another 5 µl of 1 M DTT and shake for another 10 min.\n8. Vortex 4 min at maximum speed (e.g., setting 10 on Vortex Genie II) to dislodge intraepithelial cells, then allow tissue fragments to settle.\n9. Use a serological pipette to collect the supernatant containing intraepithelial cells (including IELs) and dispense it through a 100-µm cell strainer into a new 50-ml tube (“IEL fraction”). Keep on ice.\n10. To increase the yield of intraepithelial cells, add 10 ml fresh harvest medium to the tube containing the remaining tissue fragments and vortex for 2 min to release additional cells. Collect supernatant and strain through the 100-µm cell strainer into the same IEL fraction tube.\nThis can be repeated one or two more times to maximize collection of intraepithelial cells.\nIf cells in the intraepithelial cell fraction will be analyzed separately from the lamina propria cells, strain the pooled cells once through a 70-µm strainer, centrifuge for 5 min at 350 × g, 4°C, and resuspend in the desired medium for analysis.\n11. To isolate lamina propria cells (including LPLs, neutrophils, and other immune cells of potential interest), add 5 ml prewarmed (37°C) digest medium to the tissue fragments and shake for 60 min in a 37°C incubator.",
    "12. Decant the digest and strain sequentially through 100-, 70-, and 40-µm cell strainers. At each filtration step, mash the digested tissue fragments on the filter with the plunger of a 1-ml syringe (changing the plunger between samples) and flush the strainers with 5 ml IMDM.\nTo obtain a general sample of intestinal immune cells without discriminating between intraepithelial and lamina propria–associated populations, strained intraepithelial cell preparations can be mixed back into the lamina propria cell digests at this stage.\nOptional: For a cleaner cell preparation, intraepithelial and lamina propria cells can be centrifuged through a Percoll gradient.\n13. Centrifuge filtered cells 5 min at 350 × g, 4°C. Decant supernatant.\n14. Resuspend cell pellet in sterile PBS or harvest medium. Dilute an aliquot of cells 1:1 with trypan blue and count viable cells using a hemocytometer or automated cell counter.\n15. Centrifuge cells 5 min at 350 × g, 4°C. Decant supernatant.\n16. Resuspend cell pellet in sterile PBS or desired medium at an appropriate concentration (cells/ml) for analysis. Store on ice and use as soon as possible (within a few hours).\nFor general immunophenotyping by flow cytometry, intestinal immune cells can be processed and stained using the same markers described by Bouladoux et al. (2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.824#cpz1824-bib-0011]) for Citrobacter rodentium infection models."
