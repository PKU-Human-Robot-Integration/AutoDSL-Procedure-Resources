    "All procedures described were approved by the University of Aix-Marseille institutional animal care and use committee and the French research ministry and performed in the conventional animal house of Marseille Medical Faculty (France).\n1. Define Functional Specifications of the External Fixator Based on the Following Guidelines\nOptimize bone anchorage.\nImplant half-threaded pins with a diameter (of the threaded section) of 1 mm.\nChoose a design to reduce discomfort for the animal.\nChoose an external fixator of a small size that fits into a volume of 7,723 mm3 (32 mm x 19 mm x 12.7 mm).\nChoose an external fixator with low weight, less than 13 g without the pins, to avoid disturbing the animals' gait. Choose aluminum as the material for the two blocks due to its low density.\n\t\tNOTE: The chamfers of the blocks considerably decrease the weight of the two parts.\nControl the motion of the fixator such that the direction of tensile force is maintained parallel to the direction of the bone and ensure pure tensile forces.\nUse a sliding bar that goes through the two blocks . Groove and open the blocks so each can bear two pins.\nUse an elongation screw with one smooth side that turns freely in the block and can be gripped by fingers and with a threaded side that displaces the second block by rotation. Anchor two pins to the bone, on each side of the fracture, to keep the direction of tensile force parallel to the direction of the bone. Maintain the tensile forces in the longitudinal axis to allow good distribution of stress on the pins. Secure the four pins with locking screws.\nChoose materials like aluminum, titanium, and steel that can withstand sterilization temperatures.\nEnsure that pin placement corresponds to external fixator geometry (Figure 1-B).",
    "Use a drilling guide that contains a clamp tightened on the bone to maintain the drilling position.\nShorten the lever arm of the clamp for low clamping force. Position the clamp in the middle of the device, above the future fracture, to clear the sides.\nMake the distraction easy to manual adjust by adding a knurled screw to tighten and release the mobile block.\nUse a screw wide enough to manipulate with fingers alone.\nAdd a drilled square nut in the middle of the elongation screw between the two blocks, to allow easy distraction.\nMake this square nut (8 mm on each side) larger than the two blocks to allow manual use with a thin pin or any kind of object. Turn the screw ¼ turn to allow a 0.125 mm lengthening.\n2. Surgery\nNOTE: An assistant is required for all surgical procedures. Four 12 week-old male Sprague Dawley rats were fed a standard laboratory diet ad libitum.\nPrepare surgical tools.\nSterilize all the following surgical instruments: 1 rugine, 2 Senn's retractors, 1 micro Olsen-Hegar Needle-holder, 1 Mayo-Hegar needle holder, 1 mayo scissor, and 1 scalpel.\nSterilize the external fixator, the drilling guide, 4 half-threaded pins, 4 screws, the tip and the string of the drill, and the tip and the string of the piezotome. Sterilize these instruments by autoclaving at 135 °C for 18 min.\nInstall a heating pad below the sterile field, on the surgical table. Place all instruments or tools on another sterile field.\nAnesthetize and prepare the animal.\nWeigh the rat to prepare the anesthetic and the analgesic mixture\nDetermine and calculate the amount of Bupremorphine and Carprofen to prepare the analgesic mixture extemporaneously. Use Buprenorphine (0.03 mg/mL) and Carprofen (5 mg/mL) respectively at 0.05 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg.",
    "Restrain the rat and subcutaneously inject the analgesic mixture.  Wait a few seconds, then inject intraperitoneally the anesthetic mixture.\nShave the right hind limb with an electric razor and disinfect the limb with povidone-iodine solution.\nLay the animal laterally (right side upward) on the sterile field to allow the correct positioning of the external fixator along the mediolateral axis.\nPut a sterile compress on its head to protect its eyes during surgery.\nImplant the external fixator in the femur.\nLandmark the skin incision. With a marker, draw a point from the distal part (knee) and a second point in the proximal part (hip) following the median line in the sagittal plane. Then draw a line between these 2 points.\nIncise the stretched skin along the drawing line using a scalpel.\nCut in between the biceps femoris and vastus lateralis until the femur is fully exposed, with the help of a scalpel. Use the 2 Senn's retractors (may require an assistant) to facilitate the muscle incision.\nLift the periosteum and disconnect the soft tissue from the bone with the help of a rugine.\nCheck that the exposed femur is long enough.\n\t\t\nInsert pins in the most proximal and distal holes of the external fixator.\nPosition the external fixator and check that both pins can be anchored into the femur.\nImplant 4 parallel 1 mm half-threaded pins in the femur.\n\t\t\nTake the drilling guide and move apart the muscles with 2 Senn's retractors. Tighten the clamp of the drilling guide in the middle of the femur.\nDrill 4 pre-holes in the femur. Using an electric drill, drill holes at a speed of 2,000 rpm by passing a metal drill bit of 0.6 mm diameter through the 4 guide holes.",
    "Start with the most proximal and distal holes and finish with the two middle ones of the guide. Be careful to go through both cortices but not to damage the soft tissues just beneath the femur.\nTake off the drilling guide.\nEnlarge the 4 pre-holes with 0.8 mm half-threaded pin.\n\t\t\t\nWork the pin back and forth through the 0.6 mm holes. Be careful to stay perpendicular to the femur and sink through both cortices.\nImplant 1 mm half-threaded pins.\n\t\t\t\nGrip the head of the 1 mm half-threaded pin with a needle-holder.\nSink the pin to enlarge the pre-hole. Check that the pins penetrate both cortices and do not protrude more than 1 mm, with a Senn's retractor.\nConnect the external fixator to the 4 half-threaded pins. Make sure that the offset (distance between the fixator's two blocks and the bone surface) is about 6 mm to allow easy stitches and good rigidity of the system18.\nSecure the 4 locking screws so that the external fixator is locked to the pins.\nOsteotomize the femur.\nPerform an osteotomy between the 2 central pins with a piezotome.\nClose the wound using a continuous stitch with a resorbable suture thread (5.0) and Mayo-Hegar needle holder. Make sure only the skin is stitched, and not the muscles.\nVerify the surgery and monitor animals.\nPerform an X-ray just after surgery, while the animal is still anesthetized. Check the depth of all the pins and that osteotomized extremities are aligned following the long axis.\nEnsure analgesia and antibioprophylaxy by subcutaneous injection of Buprenorphine (0.03 mg/mL) and Enrofloxacine (50 mg/mL) respectively at 0.05 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg.",
    "Determine and calculate the amount of antipamezole to reverse the anesthesia. Use antipamezole at 1mg/kg and do a subcutaneous injection to administer the product.  Allow the animal to regain consciousness and return it to its cage.\nSix hours after the surgery, inject a second dose of the analgesia mixture (Buprenorphine and Carprofen) respectively at 0.05mg/kg and 5 mg/kg subcutaneously. \n\t\tFor the next 3 days at least, give these injections twice a day for the analgesia mixture and once a day for the antibioprophylaxy. Regular clinical examinations must be performed to assess the effectiveness of analgesia and must be modified according to the behavior signs of each animal.  \nCheck that the animals can walk using their operated hind limb normally on the day following surgery.\n3. Distraction\nLeave the external fixator in neutral fixation for 1 week. X-ray the limb at the end of this phase. Check the positioning of the pins and the alignment of the bone segments.\nManually turn the square nut one half turn (0.25 mm) clockwise every 12 h to perform the distraction. Distract for 10 days, which should lead to a 5mm bone lengthening, representing a 12% lengthening relative to the initial length of the operated bone segment.\nDo not anesthetize the animal during this step. X-ray the limb half-way through and at the end of this period to check the positioning of the pins and alignment of the bone segments.\nMaintain the external fixator for 47 days. X-ray the limb weekly to check the progress of distracted gap calcification. On Day 64, remove the external fixator and let the animal walk freely for 2 more days (Day 66). The total consolidation period lasts 7 weeks.\nEuthanize all rats after 7 weeks of consolidation with an overdose of inhaled sevoflurane.",
    "Resect distracted and contralateral femurs without the surrounding tissues.\nMake a skin incision on the scar located on the median line following the sagittal plane with the help of a scalpel. Run the incision from the top of the hip to the front of the knee.\nCut in between the biceps femoris and vastus lateralis with a scalpel until the femur is fully exposed. As much as possible, disconnect the muscle attached to the bone.\nCut all the ligaments of the knee and dismantle the articulation.\nCut the joint capsule of the hip.\nClean the bone thoroughly without removing the half-threaded pins. Remove all the soft tissue with a scalpel.\nRepeat the steps from 3.5.1 to 3.5.5 for the contralateral femur.\nX-ray distracted and contralateral femurs. Remove the 4 half-threaded pins and store all femurs at -20 °C for micro-CT scan analysis (10 µm resolution).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
