    "NOTE: Procedures using zebrafish were approved by UCSF's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Preparation of Tools\nInsert minutia pin into a pin holder and clamp the pin.\nUsing fine tip forceps, carefully bend the tip of the pin to create a slight hook.\nFor manipulation and stabilization of the embryo during injury, bend the end of a 28 guage ½ inch needle mounted on an insulin syringe using needle-nose pliers.\n2. Preparation of Zebrafish Embryos for Injury\nSet up zebrafish breeding pairs and collect eggs in egg water (60ug/mL aquarium salts) as shown previously22.\nAdd 0.003% N-Phenylthiourea (PTU) to the egg water when the embryos are approximately 8 hr post fertilization (hpf) to prevent melanization.\nDechorionate two day post fertilization (dpf) embryos prior to the experiment using fine tip forceps.\n\tNOTE: Embryos can be injured anytime after circulation begins. The data presented here is for 2 dpf embryos, but the technique has been successfully applied in embryos up to 5 dpf.\nAnesthetize the embryos with 0.02% buffered 3-aminobenzoic acid (Tricaine) approximately 10 min prior to manipulations.\n3. Mechanical Vessel Injury of Embryos\nTransfer anesthetized embryos to a depression slide on a dissecting stereomicroscope using a transfer pipet.\nUsing the short flat side of the syringe needle to manipulate the embryo with the dominant hand, position the embryo on its side with the ventral surface facing away from the needle.\nPosition the minutia pin with the tip pointed directly against the ventral surface of the fish posterior to the urogenital opening. Position the minutia pin at a slight angle such that the curved tip is able to pierce through the periderm directly into the caudal vein (Figure 1).",
    "Using the syringe needle to manipulate the embryo, pierce the caudal vein with the minutia pin by tapping the embryo into the pin to slightly hook the pin into the vein.\nUsing the syringe needle, pull the embryo away from the minutia pin to create a small tear in the vessel.\n\tNOTE: A successful injury will result in immediate bleeding from the vein.\n4. Analysis of Hemostasis\nChoose only embryos with visibly circulating blood cells for this procedure.\nPrepare to begin the timer as soon as the minutia pin is pulled from the vessel.\nStart the timer as soon as blood loss can be visualized from the wound. When blood loss from the wound ceases, stop the timer and record total time as Bleeding Time. If coagulation is inhibited, record the time to when there are no longer visibly circulating blood cells.\n5. Analysis of Wound Healing\nTransfer post-injury animals onto glass-bottom imaging dishes for microscopy.\nRemove the majority of the egg water.\nCover the embryos in 0.3-1.2% low melting agarose dissolved in egg water, heated to between 42 and 45 ºC and supplemented with 0.02% Tricaine.\nPosition embryos on their sides using forceps.\nAfter the agarose cools, fill the dish with 0.02% Tricaine in egg water.\nAcquire images using brightfield, epifluorescence, or confocal microscopy.\nRemove embryo from the agarose using forceps and transfer back to egg water.\nSubscription Required.
