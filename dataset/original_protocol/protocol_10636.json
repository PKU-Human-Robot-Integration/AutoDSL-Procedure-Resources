    "1. Implant Design, Fabrication, and Surface Treatment\nManufacture rectangular implants (dimensions 4 mm x 2.5 mm x 1.3 mm; length x width x height) from commercially pure titanium (cpTi). Drill a hole centrally down the long axis of the implant (diameter = 0.7 mm) to facilitate early implant stability within the surgical site and subsequent mechanical testing (Figure 1).\nTreat the upper and lower surfaces of the implant.\n\t\nTo create two distinct surfaces, use a standard grit-blasting (GB) treatment to create a microtopographically complex surface. Further modify half of the implants by superimposing calcium phosphate (CaP) nanoparticles to create a nanotopographically complex surface.\nNote: Various chemical or mechanical treatments can be applied to create a desired surface topography and/or chemistry, and these will depend upon the nature of the experimental question to be addressed. In the example provided herein, one group of commercially pure titanium (cpTi) implants was subjected to grit-blasting (GB) - a subtractive process - to create a complex microtopography. Half of the implants were then further modified by the addition of calcium phosphate (CaP) nanocrystals to create a super imposed nanotopography (GB-DCD).\nNote: When viewing the grit-blasted micro-surface, compared to the modified nano-surface, at 10,000X magnification, there is no obvious difference in surface characteristics. However, when viewed at 100,000X magnification, differences become quite obvious (Figure 2). It has been previously shown that such surface changes have profound effects on osteoconduction14.\n2. Animal Model and Surgical Procedure\nUse young male Wistar rats (200-250 g) for this model. All procedures must be approved by local animal care committees. Allow animals free access to water and rat chow.",
    "Note: Wistar rats were selected for this procedure due to prior experience with this strain of rat, although other strains of rat could be employed. Access to food and water can be altered, depending on the nature of the experimental question being addressed.\nSedate rats using inhalation anesthesia administered through a nose cone: 4% isoflurane in 1 L O2/min for induction; 2% isoflurane in 1 L nitrous oxide and 0.6 L O2/min for maintenance. Conduct a standard toe-pinch test to ensure effective sedation before continuing with the procedure.\nAdminister analgesic pre- and post-operatively through a subcutaneous injection of 0.01-0.05 mg/kg buprenorphine.\nAssign implants by partial randomization and place bilaterally in the distal metaphyses of rat femora. This allows a different implant, one each from a selection of different surface topographies to be compared, in contralateral femora, to optimize statistical analysis.\nPrepare the animals by shaving and cleaning the antero-lateral aspect of each hind leg with 10% Betadine. To prevent hypothermia, place a warm water circulation pad underneath the anesthetized rat.\nUsing a #15 surgical scalpel, make an incision through the skin along the lateral aspect of the thigh to expose the muscle. Expose the distal femur using blunt dissection to deflect the muscle bodies in a minimally invasive manner.\nScrape away the thin layer of periosteum overlying the femur, using a periosteal elevator, to fully expose the cortical bone for drilling. Care must be taken not to damage the growth plate or articular cartilage of the knee joint during blunt dissection and removal of periosteum.\nOnce cleaned and inspected, rotate the femur laterally to expose the anterior aspect of the distal femur (Figure 3A).",
    "To prepare the surgical site, drill a bicortical rectangular slot down the middle of the bone through both cortices. To avoid overheating the tissue, saline irrigation must be maintained throughout drilling by a surgical assistant. Conduct the drilling in three stages:\n\t\nFirst, drill through the anterior cortex, exposed by dissection, using a 1.3 mm dental burr attached to a dental hand piece to create two holes 2.5 mm apart along the mid line of the femur.\nNext, use a second drill bit (twist 1.3 mm dental burr) to extend these holes through the opposing cortex, resulting in bicortical parallel holes.\nFinally, join the holes using a third custom side-cutting burr in a proximal-distal direction, forming the site for the implant (Figure 3B).\nPass a biodegradable suture through the bone defect using the attached needle and return around the outer femoral cortex.\nThread the implant over the free end of the suture and guide it into the defect, where it should be pressure-fitted. In this manner, the long axis of the implant should be oriented perpendicular to the long axis of the femur (Figure 3C).\nTie the suture around the lateral aspect of the femur to provide implant stability during post-operative recovery and early stages of healing. Use the remaining suture to close the muscle tissue, and reoppose the cutaneous tissue using surgical staples (9 mm wound clips).\nInspect surgical sites for signs of infection, and monitor animals daily for compromised ambulatory ability. Exclude the animals that do not fully recover ambulation, or those that have femoral fractures at sacrifice, from analysis.\n3. Sample Harvesting\nSacrifice animals at 9 days post-operative by cervical dislocation after CO2 exposure.",
    "Upon sacrifice, detach femora and clean of soft tissue. Store immediately in 15% sucrose buffer solution to maintain tissue hydration in preparation for mechanical testing (Figure 4A).\n\tNote: Specimens are stored in the sucrose buffer solution to maintain tissue hydration during transport between facilities. Specimens will spend approximately 2-3 hr in solution during preparation for mechanical testing.\nTo prepare specimens for mechanical testing, trim the bone to the width of the implants using a cylindrical diamond burr attached to a high speed system. The final test specimens consist of two arches of bone attached to each face of the implant (Figure 4B). For arches that fall off during preparation or transportation, assign a mechanical testing value of 0 N.\n\tNote: It is important to be very gentle and accurate when trimming the specimens, in order to avoid damaging or prestressing the interface. Bony reparative callus can grow around the long axis of the implant and even into the longitudinal hole. Such excess bone must be removed by trimming specimens to the exact dimensions of the rectangular implant, as it can skew mechanical testing results.\n4. Mechanical Testing\nA custom breakaway mold was designed to pot each specimen, creating a repeatable and accurate method of preparing samples for mechanical testing. The design allows for isolation of a 0.5 mm region of peri-implant bone for a consistent testing zone, while holding the specimen centered and completely horizontal during the potting process, allowing for the application of a force directly perpendicular to the implant surface. See Figure 5 for complete engineering drawings and Figure 6 for the final components.\nNote: Conduct all testing using a mechanical testing apparatus, operating at a crosshead speed of 30 mm/min. For a qualitative assessment of residual bone following testing, a dissecting microscope can be used.",
    "Potting of the Specimens and Mechanical Testing\n\t\nRemove specimens from the sucrose buffer solution and gently blot dry.\nPosition specimen in the custom mold. Slide the pin horizontally through holes in the walls of the mold and through the hole in the middle of the implant. Place the stabilizing plate on the posterior side of the mold to stabilize the implant (Figure 7).\nFill the base of the mold with flowable dental composite and cure for 60 sec using a high intensity curing light.\n\t\tNote: It is important to choose a composite that does not set with an exothermic reaction, as such heat generated may influence the tissue properties.\nAfter curing, open the mold and remove the hardened specimen block. Draw a thin black line in permanent marker on the lateral arch for identification purposes.\nFix a prefabricated replica of the test specimen in a vice, and center the unit on the base of the mechanical testing instrument.\nSecure the specimen into vice and pass a nylon line through the hole in the implant (Figure 8). Attach the loose ends to the center of the moving crosshead. For consistency, always label and test the lateral side first. Repeat the process with the medial arch.\nSubscription Required.
