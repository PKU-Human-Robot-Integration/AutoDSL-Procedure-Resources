    "1. Recombinant Protein Production and Purification of rBC1531\nPreparation of a recombinant BC1531 protein (rBC1531)-expression plasmid\nPrepare genomic DNA of B. cereus10.\nAmplify the bc1531 gene from a template of B. cereus genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using forward and reverse primers (see the Materials List) to create BamHI and SalI restriction enzyme sites, respectively10.\nDigest the PCR product and a modified pET49b vector (pET49bm) using BamHI and SalI, as described11.\nMix the digested PCR product and vector (3:1 ratio) from step 1.1.3 using T4 DNA ligase in a 10 µL reaction, as described11. Incubate at 18 °C for 30 min.\nPipette 3 µL of the ligation reaction into 50 µL of chemically competent E. coli DH5α cells in a tube. Mix gently by pipetting up and down and place on ice for 30 min. Heat shock for 45 s at 42 °C. Add 1 mL of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium and grow the cells while vigorously shaking (250 rpm, 37 °C, 45 min).\nTake 100 µL of the transformed cells from step 1.1.6 and spread them onto the LB-agar plates with 100 µg/mL kanamycin (Kan). Incubate for ~18 h at 37 °C.\nPick colonies using a sterile tip and grow the cells in 3 mL of LB medium with 100 µg/mL Kan; shake vigorously (250 rpm, 37 °C, 18 h).\nPrepare plasmid DNA using an alkaline-SDS lysis method, as described10.\nConfirm the nucleotide sequence of the rBC1531-expression construct using DNA sequencing12.\nOverexpression of the rBC1531 protein\nRe-transform the E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain with rBC1531-expression plasmid, as described in steps 1.1.5-1.1.6, for overexpression.\nSelect a colony and grow it in 10 mL of LB medium containing 50 µg/mL Kan (LB+Kan); shake vigorously for 18 h at 37 °C.",
    "Inoculate 10 mL of overnight culture in 1 L of LB+Kan medium and grow at 37 °C until the OD600 (optical density at 600 nm) reaches ~0.7.\nSubmerge the culture in ice-cold water for ~15 min to cool down the temperature to 18 °C and add isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to the culture at a final concentration of 1 mM for recombinant protein expression. Grow the culture at 18 °C for an additional ~16-18 h.\nPurification of rBC1531\nHarvest the cells by centrifugation (5,000 x g, 4 °C, 30 min). Discard the supernatant carefully so as to not disturb the cells. Re-suspend the cells in 50 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution containing 10 mM imidazole.\nLyse the cells twice by sonication on ice to prevent the over-heating of the cell lysates (time: 2 min 30 s; cycle on: 5 s; cycle off: 10 s; amplitude: 38%).\nClear the cell lysate by centrifugation (~25,000 x g, 4 °C, 30 min).\nMix 3 mL of nickel beads and 60 mL of PBS containing 10 mM imidazole and gravity-flow the extra buffer to settle the equilibrated nickel beads in a 2.5 x 10 cm glass chromatography column.\nPipette to transfer the supernatant from step 1.3.3 to the column with pre-equilibrated nickel beads and incubate at 4 °C for 2 h on a spinning wheel at a low speed (~20 rpm).\nAllow the supernatant to drain by gravity and wash the nickel beads in the column three times with 100 mL of PBS containing 10 mM imidazole.\nElute rBC1531 protein by applying 4 x 5 mL of PBS containing 250 mM imidazole.\nTake 15 µL of the elution from step 1.3.7 and run it on 15% SDS-PAGE. Visualize the protein bands on the gel using Coomassie blue staining10.",
    "Removal of the affinity tags of the rBC1531 protein by thrombin proteolysis\nPipette the fractions into dialysis tube (molecular weight cut off: 3 kDa) and place the tube in a beaker containing 4 L of thrombin cleavage-compatible buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 1.5 mM β-mercaptoethanol) at 4 °C overnight.\nPipette the fractions and transfer them to a conical tube.\nMeasure the absorbance at 280 nm and estimate the rBC1531 protein concentration, as described13.\nTake 50 µg of rBC1531 in a 0.5 mL tube and add various amounts of thrombin (i.e., 2, 1, 0.6, and 0.3 units). Incubate the rBC1531 and thrombin reactions at 20 °C for ~3 h to determine the least amount of thrombin required to cleave the N-terminal affinity tag.\nRun the rBC1531 and thrombin reactions on a 15% SDS-PAGE and determine the lowest amount of thrombin (e.g., 0.3 units of thrombin per 50 µg of rBC1531) that completely digests the N-terminal affinity tag and produce a tag-free rBC1531.\nAdd 10 mg of rBC1531 protein and 60 units of thrombin to a 15 mL tube and incubate at 20 °C for ~3 h for the thrombin-proteolysis reaction.\nApply gel-filtration standards to a size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) column to prepare a standard curve of molecular weights and elution volumes, as described13.\nPlace the thrombin-digested rBC1531 protein from step 1.4.6 in a centrifugal filter tube (molecular weight cut off: 3 kDa) and centrifuge at 3,000 g at 4 °C to reduce to a volume of less than 5 mL.\nApply the concentrated rBC1531 protein to the SEC column and collect 60 eluted fractions in 0.5 mL per tube13.",
    "Take 15 µL of each fraction, run them on a 15% SDS-PAGE, and stain the gel using Coomassie staining solution (0.15% (w/v) Coomassie brilliant blue, 40% (v/v) methanol, and 10% (v/v) glacial acetic acid) as described10.\nPipette the fractions that contain rBC1531 and collect them in one tube.\n2. Crystallization Screening and Optimization of rBC1531\nScreening conditions for rBC1531 protein crystallization\nConcentrate the rBC1531 from step 1.4.11 up to ~18.5 mg/mL using a centrifugal filter tube, as described in step 1.4.8.\nAdd 50 µL of each crystallization screening solution (see section 2.2)14 to the wells of 96-well sitting-drop crystallization plates. Place 0.5 µL of the 18.5 mg/mL rBC1531 protein solution on a sitting bed. Mix the protein solution with 0.5 µL of the well solution, repeating the process for the entire plate.\nCover the plate with clear adhesive film. Place the 96-well plates at 18 °C and allow for vapor diffusion.\nScan the drops at 20-40X magnification using a light microscope to monitor crystal formation daily for 2-3 weeks.\nCollect X-ray diffraction data12 using the obtained rBC1531 protein crystals.\nOptimization of rBC1531 crystallization conditions\nPrepare 500 µL of the selected initial crystallization condition solution (e.g., 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5 and 1.0 M sodium citrate) and fill a 24-well crystallization plate for the sitting drop.\nAdd 0.5 µL of the 18.5 mg/mL rBC1531 protein solution to a sitting bed, mix with 0.5 µL of the well solution, and cover the plate immediately with clear adhesive film. Place the plate at 18 °C.\nObserve crystal growth under a light microscope for a week.",
    "Optimize various crystallization conditions by varying the pH (i.e., pH 5.5-6.8) of 0.1 M cacodylate and by altering the salt concentration (i.e., 0.9-1.2 M) of sodium citrate to obtain singular crystals. Monitor crystal growth for ~1 week and collect X-ray diffraction data12.\n3. Characterization of the Nucleoside Triphosphatase (NTPase) Activity of rBC1531\nValidation of the inorganic phosphate-dependent colorimetric study\nPrepare a stock of pyrophosphate (100 mM) and dilute it to final concentrations of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10, 50, 100, and 250 µM in 200 µL of reaction buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl; and 2 mM MgCl2) in duplicate 96-well plates. Use the first plate as a control (this does not contain pyrophosphatase). Ensure that the second plate contains pyrophosphatase as a working plate, as directed in step 3.1.2.\nAdd 0.01 unit of Saccharomyces cerevisiae inorganic pyrophosphatase (1 µL) to the wells of the working plate and incubate at 20 °C for 30-60 min.\nPrepare molybdate acid solution by mixing ammonium molybdate (0.86% v/v) and ascorbic acid (14% v/v) solutions in a 7:3 ratio. Add 16 µL of molybdate acid solution to both the working and control wells and wait for 15 min.\nRead the optical density at 690 nm (OD690nm).\nColorimetric NTPase assay\nPrepare a stock of 100 mM nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) substrate and dilute to the desired concentration (e.g., 0, 0.2, 4.4, 11, 22, 44, 88, or 132 µM) in 180 µL of assay buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl; and 2 mM MgCl2).",
    "Add 20 µg of rBC1531 (1.5 mM) and the NTP substrates from step 3.2.1 up to 200 µL per reaction in a 96-well plate and pipette up and down to mix well. Cover the plate with its lid and place it in a 37 °C incubator for 30 min to perform the substrate hydrolysis reaction.\nTransfer the plate to a 70 °C water bath and allow to stand for 15 min to stop rBC1531-mediated catalytic reactions.\nAdd 0.01 unit of S. cerevisiae inorganic pyrophosphatase (1 µL) to each well of the reaction plate (from step 3.2.3) and incubate at 20 °C for 30 min. Add 16 µL of molybdate acid solution to the reaction plate to develop the color (~15 min). Read at OD690nm.\nAnalyze using the Michaelis-Menten equation, as described12.\nSubscription Required.
