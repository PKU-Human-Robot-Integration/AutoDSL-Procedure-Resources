    "PreparationCoat plates/coverglasses using poly-L-lysine (PLL) for 12 h at 4 °C or for 2-4 h at 37 °C. The coverglasses are immersed in PLL in a 10 cm cell culture plate. For coating 12-well culture plates, 0.5 ml of PLL is added to each well to cover the whole surface. Wash 3-4 x with 1 ml cold PBS followed by a quick rinse with 1 ml sterile water, and air dry the plate or coverglasses in the sterile cell culture hood.Disinfect all dissection tools in 70% ethanol.Embryo dissections (all procedures have been approved by UCSD IACUC)One Sprague Dawley female pregnant rat (E17.5)Anesthetize the rat in an approved CO2 chamber.Perform cervical dislocation.Disinfect the rat’s abdomen with 70% ethanol.Cut the skin with scissors in a T fashion, posterior to anterior direction followed by an intersecting cut right above the genital area.Cut the muscle tissue in a similar pattern.Locate the horns of the uterus and sever with scissors, remove the uterus.Place uterus in a 10 cm TC dish and cut along the uterus freeing each embryo in its amniotic sac and placenta.Remove each embryo from its amniotic sac and transfer to a 10 cm TC dish with 10-15 ml 1x HBSS to cover all embryos. Place this dish on ice.Note: For steps B3-B8, Please see an excellent video presentation in Pacifici and Peruzzi (2012).BFCNs dissectionsPlace an embryo into a 10 cm TC dish on ice. And the following dissection procedures are performed either at room temperature or on ice.Remove the head with a razor blade.Use #5 biologie forceps to cut the skin and soft bones to expose the whole brain.Gently extract the brain and put it on a 10 cm TC dish.Cut and remove the olfactory tubercles, cerebellum and brain stem.",
    "Carefully remove the meninges membrane (meninges will become separate from the brain and become more visible when the tissue is immersed in 1x HBSS, starting from the edge of the tissue, use forceps to carefully peel the reddish membrane off the brain, as complete as possible). The basal forebrain is just located close to the medial and ventral surfaces of the cerebral hemispheres. Gently open the cerebral hemispheres along the sagittal suture to expose the diencephalon and the basal forebrain.  Make a transversal cut to separate the posterior side of the basal forebrain from the anterior pole of the diencephalon.Note: For steps C1-C9, please refer to excellent photo and video presentations in Schnitzler et al., 2008. Place the basal forebrain tissues in a 15 ml tube with 1x HBSS and place the tube in ice.Repeat steps C1-C9 and collect all the BFCN tissues.Mechanical/enzymatic dissociation of BFCNsWash the BFCN tissues with 5 ml cold 1x HBSS, repeat for 4 times. Remove the buffer by pipette.Add 1.8 ml 1x HBSS, 0.2 ml 10x trypsin (2.5%).Incubate for 15 min in a 37 °C water bath.Add 0.2 ml 10x DNase (10 mg/ml) and gently pipette up and down 10-15 times with a fire-polished glass Pasteur pipette until the mixture becomes homogenous suspension with no visible undigested tissues. Pre-warm plating media at 37 °C before use.Add 5 ml pre-warmed plating media and spin for 5 min at 500 x g (or 1,000 rpm) at room temperature.Remove supernatant.Add plating media (volume determined by desired plating density/method).Note: 500 µl per well for 12-well plate or 150 µl for coverglass.After 30 min, add 1 ml plating media and put into a 37 °C CO2 incubator.Change to maintenance media the next day.",
    "The cultures can be maintained for 10-14 days with half the media changed to fresh media every other day."
