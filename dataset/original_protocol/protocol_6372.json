    "Construction of pLUX reporter plasmidsDetermine promoter region around a target gene. Typically, we take a region of DNA from 500 base-pairs (bp) upstream to 150 bp downstream of distal transcription start site (see for instance, the determined promoters of 18 target genes Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200110/20200110011618_0767.jpgFigure 1. Eighteen E. coli promoter regions into pLuxDesign primers which including 15 overlapping nucleotides (nt) with the pLUX vector for amplification of the determined promoter region (see Figure 2 and Table 1).Amplify target promoter regions by PCR using Ex Taq polymerase (Takara Bio). Standard reaction condition is used as described in the manual for Ex Taq polymerase (Takara Bio). In most of the cases, thermal cycle conditions are as follows: after heating at 98 °C for 5 min, process 30 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s (denature), 50 °C for 30 s (annealing), and 72 °C for 1 min (elongation) (Figure 2).Purify the PCR product by NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up (Macherey-Nagel).Note: When PCR product includes non-specific bands, the target product is cut from agarose gel after electrophoresis with total volume of PCR product and then purified by NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up (Macherey-Nagel). Digest pLUX vector using restriction enzymes Xho I and Bam HI, and then purify the liner pLUX by NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up (Macherey-Nagel).Note: For cloning into pLUX, we recommend the double-digestion of pLUX by both Xho I and Bam HI (Figure 2). Clone a target promoter as the purified PCR product into the liner pLUX using In-Fusion HD Cloning Plus (Takara Bio).Note: We recommend in vivo E. coli cloning (iVEC) as an alternative DNA cloning method (Nozaki et al., 2019), which is provided from National BioResource Project (NBRP) of Japan. Add a part (~10 μl) of the In-Fusion reaction mixture into 0.1 ml of the suspension of competent E.",
    "coli DH5α (see Recipes), and then incubate the mixture on ice for 30 min.Heat the mixture at 42 °C for 45 s, and immediately add 0.9 ml of LB broth to the mixture.Incubate 1 ml of the suspension of E. coli DH5α transformants at 37 °C for 60 min.Spread 0.1-0.2 ml of the suspension of E. coli DH5α transformants onto the LB agar with 50 μg/ml kanamycin, and then incubate the agar plate at 37 °C overnight.Isolate a transformant of E. coli DH5α harboring the cloned candidates as a single colony on the LB agar with 50 μg/ml kanamycin.Inoculate a single colony into 5 ml of LB broth containing 0.05 ml of 50 mg/ml kanamycin in a glass tube (Iwaki), and incubate the culture in water bath (Taitec) at 37 °C with shaking (120 rpm) overnight.Isolate the plasmid from the transformant cells of 5 ml overnight culture by Plasmid DNA Extraction Mini Kit (Favorgen).Sanger reaction is performed with the isolated plasmid as a template, LUX-R primer (Table 1), and BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Ready Reaction Mix (Applied Biosystems) according to the recommended procedure by Supplier.Transfer 20 μl of sanger product into a sterile 1.5 ml plastic tube and then add 2 μl of 125 mM EDTA, 2 μl of 3 M sodium acetate, and 50 μl of ethanol (Nacalai Tesque).Mix the solution by vortex mixer for 15 s.Collect DNA pellet by centrifugation (17,800 x g, 4 °C, 15 min).Add 70 μl of 70% ethanol and collect DNA pellet by centrifugation (17,800 x g, 4 °C, 15 min).Dissolve DNA pellet by 15 μl of Hi-DiTM Formamide (Applied Biosystems).Determine DNA sequence of the promoter region cloned into the isolated plasmid with DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200110/20200110011655_3040.jpgFigure 2. Strategy for construction of pLUX reporter plasmid. The promoter region was amplified by PCR using the E.",
    "coli K-12 genome as the template and a pair of specific primers (Table 1). The amplified DNA fragment was inserted into a pLUX vector using the In-Fusion HD cloning kit (Takara Bio). After transformation of DH5α, the plasmid was purified from a culture of transformant cells. The DNA sequence of insertion on the resulting plasmids was confirmed by DNA sequencing.Table 1. The used primers and pLUX derivativesimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200110/20200110013653_0704.jpgThe plasmids constructed in this study could be provided from National BioResource Project (NBRP) E. coli of Japan.Measurement of luciferase activity in E. coli Transform E. coli strains by the cloned luciferase reporter plasmids.Note: The ∆hns∆hha∆ydgT strain, isolated from E. coli K-12 W3110 strain, deleted three genes, hns, hha, and ydgT, in its genome (Ueda et al., 2013). H-NS plays a role in transcriptional silencing of genes, which is modulated by Hha and YdgT proteins in E. coli. The ∆hns∆hha∆ydgT strain was transformed with pQE80L, pQE80Lhns which carries hns gene in pQE80L, pQE80Lhns-I70A which carries hns gene with substitutions of Ile70Ala, or pQE80Lhns-L75A which carries hns gene with substitutions of Leu75Ala. These transformants were used as hosts for luciferase measurements. Inoculate at least three single colonies of E. coli transformant in glass tubes separately under M9-glucose medium including 50 μg/ml kanamycin.Note: In addition of kanamycin, ampicillin should be added in medium at the final concentration of 100 μg/ml for the ∆hns∆hha∆ydgT strain harboring a pQE80L derivative and a pLux derivative. Incubate the pre-cultures at 37 °C with shaking for overnight.Inoculate 100 μl of overnight pre-culture in 10 ml of fresh M9-glucose medium including 50 μg/ ml kanamycin.Incubate the 10 ml cultures at 37 °C in water bath (Taitec) with shaking (120 rpm) until luciferase activity is measured.",
    "Transfer 100 μl of culture to a well of a Black/Clear BD Falcon 96-well plate (Becton Dickinson) in triplicate for each culture.Note: We tested 96-well plates for measuring luminescence in E. coli with the plate reader (Corona), indicating that the 96-well white plate showed the leakage of 1.5% to an adjacent empty well whereas the 96-well black plate reduced leakage by 0.95% (see the row data in both 96 plates in Figure 3). Although a white plate is usually used for luminescent measurements, a black plate was used to prevent leakage of high luminescence from one culture to other well in this study. Additionally, during measurement we arranged cultures with a single well gap between them to minimize leakage to adjacent wells. However, we recommend that a white plate be used first as standard procedure.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200110/20200110013810_9859.jpgFigure 3. The measured intensity of luciferase activity in E. coli in 96-well plates. E. coli K-12 W3110 (parent strain) harbouring pLUXappYp, containing appY-lux operon (data not shown) was grown in M9-glucose medium at 37 °C, and culture was applied into three wells (A1, A2, and A3) of both the 96-well black plate (Becton Dickinson, catalog number: 353948) (upper) and the 96-well white plate (Becton Dickinson, catalog number: 353377) (lower). M9-glucose medium (H5, H6, and H7) and distilled water (H9, H10, and H11) were also applied into three wells of both the 96-well plates. Each intensity is shown as a raw data measured with the plate reader (Corona). The fluorescent intensity was detected in the empty wells adjacent to wells filled by culture (A4 and B1 to B4).Transfer 100 μl of fresh M9-glucose medium to another well of the Black/Clear BD Falcon 96-well plate (Becton Dickinson) used in Step B6 in triplicate for background.",
    "Set the Black/Clear BD Falcon 96-well plate (Becton Dickinson) containing the samples and the background with plate reader (Corona).Measure OD600 according to the procedure for the plate reader (Corona).Measure luminescence as a total intensity. Therefore, no filter is set according to the procedure for the plate reader (Corona)."
