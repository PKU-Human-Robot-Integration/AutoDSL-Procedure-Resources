    "All animal procedures were approved by the local committee for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, Kyung Hee University (license number: KHUASP(SE)-18-108) and conformed to the US National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n1. Experimental animals\nKeep all mice (39 mice, Balb/c, male, 7‒9 weeks old) in a pathogen-free facility as per the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals.\nMaintain the mice on a 12 h light/dark cycle at constant temperature with free access to food and water.\n2. Preparation of anesthetics\nNOTE: Tribromoethanol is used over ketamine combinations and isoflurane, based on the stability of heart rate and the reproducibility of echocardiography in tribromoethanol-anesthetized mice1,5,6\nMake a stock solution of 2,2,2-tribromoethanol at a concentration of 1 g per 1 mL tertiary amyl alcohol. Warm at 40‒45 °C for 24 h. Store at 4 °C for 12 months.\nFor working solution, dilute 0.5 mL of stock solution in 19.5 mL of saline (0.9% NaCl) to 25 mg/mL. Warm at 40‒45 °C for 1 h. Store at 4 °C for 1 month.\n3. ECG system setup\nMake sure to set up the system such that there is no noise or vibration within 2 m since ECG signals in a mouse are sensitive to the environmental noise and movement.\nPrepare the hardware setup: a data acquisition system, a bio amplifier, and a computer that is installed with an ECG data analysis software.\n\t\nConnect the data acquisition system to the mains (AC) using the power cable.\nConnect the data acquisition system to the computer using a USB cable.\nConnect the signal output on the rear panel of the bio amplifier to an analog input on the front panel of the data acquisition system using a cable.",
    "Connect the I2C output of the data acquisition system to the I2C input of the bio amplifier using the I2C cable.\nConnect the 3-lead bio amplifier cable to the 6-pin input socket on the front panel of the bio amplifier.\nTurn on the data acquisition system using the switch on the back panel.\n\t\tNOTE: In brief, the signals are amplified through a bio amplifier and recorded using a computerized data acquisition and analysis system with the following channel settings: sampling rate of 2 k/s, range of 20 mV, and low-pass filter setting of 200 Hz.\nOpen the analysis software program and set it up for ECG data acquisition.\n\t\nGo to Setup | Channel Settings. Set the Sample Rate to 2 k/s. Set the Range to 20 mV. Set the Input Amplifier to 200 Hz of Low Pass.\nGo to ECG Analysis | ECG Settings. Choose “Mouse” in the Preset of Detection and Analysis settings.\nIn the Averaging panel, choose to concatenate N (e.g., 4 beats or 60 s) consecutive cardiac cycles into a single average signal for Averaging View and Table View.\nIn the QTc panel, select “Bazett” method, which is defined as the heart rate-corrected value of QT interval: QTc = QT / (RR/100)0.5, RR interval = 60 / heart rate7.\n4. ECG measurement\nPlace a mouse on a precision scale and record its weight.\nInduce anesthesia in the mouse by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a working solution of tribromoethanol (18 mL of working solution per kg body weight (b.w.)).\nPlace an anesthetized mouse in supine position. Ensure that the mouse is completely anesthetized (less than 2 min).",
    "Insert the electrodes with acupuncture needles subcutaneously into the right and left forelimbs and the left hindlimb according to the lead II ECG scheme and fix them with tape (Figure 1). Ensure that the depth and position of inserted electrodes are consistent throughout the experiments.\nConnect the other ends of the electrodes by clicking them into the three snap connectors at the other end of the lead wires of the 3-lead bio amplifier cable.\nInject drugs (i.p.) 3 min after the anesthetics have been delivered (Figure 2).\nBegin recording the ECG 10 min after injecting anesthetics. Once the recording is completed, use the ECG data from 12 to 17 min after injection of anesthetics for analysis.\nAt the end of the ECG recording session, carefully remove the electrodes.\n5. ECG data analysis\nGo to ECG Analysis | Averaging View and ensure that the software correctly identifies the start and end of the P wave, QRS complex, and T wave in individual beats. If necessary, manual correction of these waves and intervals is possible by moving misplaced cursors to the appropriate positions.\n\tNOTE: As depicted in Figure 3A, the PR interval spans the onset of the P wave to that of the QRS complex (mostly missing Q wave in a mouse ECG). The QRS duration extends from the onset of the Q wave (primarily an R wave in a mouse ECG) to the end of the S wave. The QT interval comprises the onset of the Q wave (mostly the R wave in a mouse ECG) to the end of the T wave. Note the shorter duration and absence of a Q wave and ST segment in the mouse ECG relative to the human ECG8.",
    "Go to ECG Analysis | Table View and select the correctly identified ECG data by checking individual beats in the Averaging View window.\n\tNOTE: Figure 3 shows several examples of actual mouse ECG signals. Figure 3A represents a normal wild-type signal that has been correctly identified with regard to P wave, QRS complex, and T wave. Computerized selection of PQRS waves can incur erroneous misplacements, such as in Figure 3B a normal wild-type signal that misplaces the onset of the P wave. In Figure 3C an ECG signal that misplaces the end of the QRS complex, resulting in an overestimation of QRS duration. In Figure 3D an ECG signal that misplaces the end of the QRS complex, resulting in underestimation of the QRS complex due to the ambiguous T wave and Figure 3E an ECG signal with an unidentifiable T wave. Without exclusion or manual corrections, PQRS intervals can be over or underestimated. Be sure to select the ECG signals that have been correctly identified and the signals that do not miss the target peaks. Consequently, such cases, including B, C, D, and E (Figure 3), are excluded in accurately estimating ECG parameters in general.\nSelect the ECG data of interest in Table View, and copy/paste them to a spreadsheet file.\n6. Statistical analysis\nPerform the statistical analysis using a statistics program. Analyze the data with the experimental conditions blinded. Perform Student’s t-test and Mann-Whitney U-test for 2-group comparisons. The numbers in each figure indicate the number of mice that is used for each group. Report the results as mean ± SEM.\nConsider differences with p < 0.05 by U-test to be statistically significant: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; and ***, p < 0.005 versus respective controls.\nSubscription Required.
