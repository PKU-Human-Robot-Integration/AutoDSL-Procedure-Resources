    "1. PDMS MyoTACTIC plate fabrication\nNOTE: PDMS MyoTACTIC plate fabrication requires a PU negative mold, which can be manufactured as previously described30. The computer-aided design (CAD) SolidWorks file for the MyoTACTIC plate design has been made available on GitHub (https://github.com/gilbertlabcode/MyoTACTIC-SolidWork-CAD-file).\nPrepare ~ 110 g of PDMS polymer solution in a disposable plastic cup at a 1:15 ratio of monomer to curing agent using the components in the silicone elastomer kit. Stir the polymer solution for 2-3 min using a 5 mL disposable serological pipette until completely mixed and homogenous.\n\tCAUTION: Avoid PDMS polymer solution contact with skin and eyes; and avoid inhalation. Always wear a lab coat and disposable gloves when handling the liquid PDMS mixture and refer to Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for specific safety protocols.\n\tNOTE: Protect equipment surfaces (e.g., scale, bench top, etc.) with a disposable covering in case of PDMS polymer solution spill.\nDegas the mixture at room temperature by placing the cup within a benchtop vacuum chamber connected to a standard duty dry vacuum pump for ~30 min, or until all bubbles are removed. Break the vacuum every 5-10 min to aid in degassing. Use an empty 50 mL syringe barrel to plunge air and blow out any remaining bubbles on the surface of the polymer mixture as needed.\n\tNOTE : A piece of 6.35 mm ID tubing can be used for connecting a P1250 pipette tip to the barrel to improve the velocity and accuracy of the air stream.\nWhile the PDMS polymer solution is degassing, remove any leftover pieces of PDMS adhered to the PU negative mold by gently wiping down the edges and surface with a dry paper towel. Use facility compressed air, set to 70-100 kPag to remove remaining fine particles.",
    "NOTE: Protect the PU negative mold from damage and from particulate accumulation by placing it in a sealable plastic bag and storing it within a drawer that is protected from laboratory traffic.\nPlace the PU mold in a chemical hood that has been protected with a disposable covering. Stand the mold horizontally at ~75° and spray the active surface with an even layer of release agent. Spray the mold from top to bottom, then left to right, while holding the can 15-20 cm from the mold and using a fluid back and forth sweeping motion. Rotate the mold 180° and repeat sprays, then let the PU mold sit in the chemical hood for 10-15 min to dry.\n\tCAUTION: Ensure release agent is used within a chemical fume hood, avoid contact with skin and eyes, and refer to Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for specific safety protocols\n\tNOTE: A thin film needs to fully cover the active surface, but excessive coating can be transferred to the PDMS in the next step, which can in turn negatively impact hMMT seeding. The surface should feel slick to the touch but not wet.\nPour 100 g of PDMS evenly into the PU mold and place within a vacuum chamber connected to a rotary vane vacuum pump. Degas the PDMS-filled mold for ~45 min, breaking the vacuum seal every 5-10 min for the first 20 min to accelerate the process. Leave within the vacuum chamber until the PDMS mixture is completely void of all bubbles.",
    "NOTE: A rotary vane vacuum pump is used to achieve a lower vacuum and reduce the time required for this step. Degassing of the PDMS-filled mold can be performed using the benchtop vacuum chamber and the standard duty dry vacuum pump, however, the time to void the mixture of all bubbles will be longer. What is essential is the removal of all bubbles from the PDMS polymer solution, especially in those regions destined to become hMMT anchoring posts. Bubbles in this region will result in anchor post breakage, the loss of culture wells, and in turn result in a small piece of PDMS remaining wedged in the mold.\nTransfer the degassed PDMS-filled PU mold to a 65 °C oven, incubating overnight to cure the liquid rubber.\nRemove the cured PDMS positive plate from the oven and cool the plate at room temperature for at least 30 min.\nWith a bladeless scalpel, gently detach cured PDMS from the PU mold by running the back of the handle between the PDMS and walls of the mold. Start along the upper edge and separate all 4 sides, before pushing down to the base of the mold and detaching this portion. This step is complete when the back of the handle runs smoothly between the PDMS and all 4 walls of the PU mold.\n\tNOTE: Work slowly and carefully with the bladeless scalpel to prevent cracking the PU mold or tearing the PDMS. This step should take 15-20 min.\nStarting from one end, use the bladeless scalpel to lift-up the edge of the PDMS and work fingers between the cured PDMS culture plate and PU mold. Then, using both hands, push fingers further underneath the plate, slowly peeling up and out of the PU mold.",
    "NOTE: Work slowly and use both hands to evenly peel the plate. Minimize bending to reduce the likelihood of anchor post breakage. This step should take 5-10 min.\nUse a single edge razor blade to cut the plate into groups of 6 ± 2 MyoTACTIC wells (Figure 1) for tissue seeding purposes. Place full MyoTACTIC plates, or plate portions, into an instrument sterilization bag and autoclave for a 25 min dry cycle (20 min of sterilization time, and 5 min of dry time) at 120 °C and 100-140 kPag.\n2. Culture of immortalized human myoblast progenitor cells\nNOTE: The immortalized myoblasts used in this protocol were obtained from the Institut de Myologie (Paris, France)31.\nObtain one vial of frozen cells from the liquid nitrogen dewar and quick thaw the vial in a 37 °C water bath (in less than 1 min). Cells are frozen at a density of 7.5 x 105 cells per 1 mL of freezing media consisting of 90% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).\nGently transfer the contents of the vial to a 15 mL conical tube containing 9 mL of pre-warmed wash medium consisting of 89% DMEM 1x, 10% FBS and 1% Pen/Strep to dilute out the DMSO. Spin the 15 mL conical tube at 400 x g for 10 min and then aspirate away the media taking care to avoid the cell pellet.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL of growth media consisting of 84% Skeletal Muscle Cell Basal Medium with Skeletal Muscle Cell Growth Medium Supplement Mix, 15% FBS and 1% Pen/Strep and then transfer to a 50 mL conical tube with 29 mL of growth media.",
    "Transfer 10 mL of media containing approximately 2.5 x 105 cells into a 100 mm x 20 mm cell culture dish. Repeat this step with the remaining 20 mL of the cell solution. Then transfer cell culture dishes to a humidified cell culture incubator set to 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nRefresh the culture media every other day. Culture the cells until they achieve ~ 70%-80% confluency (typically 4-5 days), at which point the cells are prepared for seeding. 1.5 x 105 cells are required to generate each hMMT. Therefore, passage the cells as needed to achieve the requisite number of cells.\n\t​NOTE: The immortalized myoblast progenitor cell lines should never exceed 80% confluency before seeding cells into MyoTACTIC wells, passaging the cells, or preparing freezer stocks. hMMTs fabricated from cells that have exceeded 80% confluency often fail to reach contractile maturity. Passaging procedures are identical to methods described below in step 3.\n3. Seeding engineered hMMTs with MyoTACTIC\nPreparation of MyoTACTIC culture wells and reagents for hMMT seeding.\n\tNOTE: This protocol provides specific details to produce 6 hMMTs.\n\t\n2-3 h before cell seeding, place a 6 well MyoTACTIC plate portion into a 10 cm cell culture dish. Prepare each individual MyoTACTIC culture well by adding 100 µL of a 5% Pluronic F-127 solution into each well. Put the lid on the 10 cm culture dish, apply paraffin to seal the space between the 10 cm dish and lid, and then place the 10 cm plate containing the MyoTACTIC portion into a centrifuge outfitted with a plate spinner adaptor.\n\t\t​NOTE: If a centrifuge plate spinner adaptor is not available, a p20 pipette tip can be used to carefully remove bubbles from behind the posts, thereby ensuring that the entire culture surface is evenly coated.",
    "Centrifuge at 1,550 x g for 1 min to remove all bubbles within culture wells, especially behind the posts. Store the 10 cm cell culture dish containing the MyoTACTIC plate portion containing Pluronic F-127 solution at 4 °C until the cells are prepared for seeding.\n\t\t​NOTE: Pluronic F-127 coating can be applied for as little as 2 h to as long as 24 h. For example, wells can be filled with Pluronic F-127 solution at the end of the day for use the next day. Do not exceed 24 h as this will negatively impact hMMT remodeling and fail to form healthy tissues that reach contractile maturity.\nSlowly thaw one 50 µL basement membrane extract aliquot and one 10 µL thrombin aliquot (100 U/mL stock solution) on ice within the culture hood.\n\t\t​NOTE: Do not refreeze basement membrane extract aliquots. They are single use. Thrombin aliquots are reusable, therefore, re-freeze up to 5 times after use.\nWeigh ~7 mg of powdered fibrinogen in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and then transfer to the cell culture hood. Add 700 µL of 0.9% (wt/vol) NaCl solution in water (or saline solution) to arrive at a 10 mg/mL final concentration solution. Do not vortex fibrinogen to dissolve, instead place the tube in a 37 °C cell culture incubator for 3-5 min.\nRemove and flick the tube gently, then pulse spin the dissolved solution in a benchtop mini centrifuge (microfuge) and return to culture hood. Filter the fibrinogen solution using a 1 mL syringe outfitted with a 0.22 µm syringe filter. Transfer the dissolved fibrinogen solution to ice alongside the basement membrane extract and thrombin aliquots.",
    "Lastly, prepare the hMMT seeding media that will be introduced to the culture wells after seeding of the tissues. This media contains Skeletal Muscle Cell Basal Medium supplemented with 20% FBS, 1% P/S and 3% 6-aminocaproic acid (ACA; 1.5 mg/mL final concentration is achieved by diluting from a 50 mg/mL stock solution; % is expressed as v/v). Pre-warm the media at 37 °C before use.\nPreparation of cells for hMMT seeding.\n\t\nCollect the cell culture plates from the culture incubator. Aspirate the media from each plate, then wash cells once with D-PBS by adding 5 mL of D-PBS into each culture plate. Next aspirate the D-PBS and detach the cells by adding 1 mL of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA into each culture dish. Place in the cell culture incubator for 3 min.\nHalt the trypsin by adding 3 mL wash medium (89% of 1x DMEM + 10% FBS + 1% Pen/Strep) to the culture dish. Transfer the cell solution to an appropriately sized conical tube, and then pellet the cells by centrifuging at 400 x g for 10 min. Aspirate the media taking care to avoid the cell pellet. Then resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of the wash medium.\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer and trypan blue dye under brightfield microscopy.\n\t\t​If using multiple plates of cells, this cell suspension will be very concentrated. Dilute cell suspensions prior to counting as needed.",
    "Since each tissue requires 150,000 cells resuspended in 15 µL of the extracellular matrix (ECM) mixture, 900,000 cells in 90 µL of ECM mixture is required for 6 tissues. To account for cell-ECM solution loss that occurs during the preparation process due to bubble formation or pipette loss, prepare extra cell-ECM mixture (i.e., 8 tissues, or 1,200,000 cells in 120 µL of ECM). Transfer the volume of cell suspension containing 1,200,000 cells into a new conical tube. Increase the volume to 10 mL with wash medium and spin at 400 x g for 10 min.\nWhile cells are spinning down, prepare 150 µL ECM mixture in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube using the following recipe. First add 60 µL of DMEM (40% volume), then add 60 µL of Fibrinogen 10 mg/mL solution (40% volume) and lastly add 30 µL of basement membrane extract (20% volume). Store the ECM mixture on ice until use.\n\t\t​NOTE: Always use tips pre-chilled at -20 °C when working with solutions containing basement membrane extract. ECM mixture contains 4 mg/mL of fibrinogen.\nSeeding hMMTs\n\t\nCollect the conical tube containing the spun down cells and aspirate the media taking care to avoid the cell pellet. Vigorously flick the end of the tube with a gloved finger to dislodge the pellet and continue flicking until the pellet appears as a cell slurry.\n\t\t​NOTE: It is important to aspirate as much wash media as possible to ensure the cell-ECM suspension is at the desired dilution. Use a pipette to remove remaining wash media if needed.",
    "Transfer 120 µL of the ECM solution to the tube containing the cell pellet. Pipette up and down to thoroughly resuspend the cells within the ECM to generate a single cell suspension. Pipette slowly and carefully to avoid introducing bubbles, which would reduce the working volume. Then, place the cell-ECM solution on ice until use.\nRetrieve MyoTACTIC plate portions containing Pluronic F-127 coated MyoTACTIC wells from the 4 °C refrigerator and place the 10 cm dish containing the MyoTACTIC wells on top of an ice pack inside of the cell culture hood.\nAspirate the Pluronic F-127 solution from each well. The PDMS is porous and will soak up the Pluronic F-127 solution, especially if plates were spun down with a centrifuge. Allow residual Pluronic F-127 solution to release and settle to the bottom of the well by letting wells sit for 5 min, then aspirate again.\n\t\t​NOTE: Use a Pasteur pipette with a p1250 tip attached at the end, and a p200 tip over the p1250 tip when aspirating the Pluronic F-127 solution. This will improve precision to prevent accidental aspiration of the post structures. Avoid scraping the oval pool shaped cell seeding area at the bottom of the well with the pipette as this disrupts the Pluronic F-127 coating and interferes with the hMMT self-organization process. The proper technique is to hover the pipette tip just over the oval pool while aspirating the Pluronic F-127 solution.\nPipette the cell-ECM suspension carefully to resuspend any cells that may have sunk to the bottom of the tube. Then transfer 105 µL of cell-ECM suspension into a fresh, pre-chilled 1.5 mL tube. Take care to grasp the tube close to the top to prevent the solution from warming.",
    "Add 0.84 µL of the 100 U/mL thrombin stock solution to the 105 µL cell-ECM suspension to arrive at a final concentration of 0.2 U/mg of fibrinogen. Pipette rapidly, carefully, and thoroughly to mix, while avoiding introduction of bubbles.\n\t\t​NOTE: Thrombin initiates the rapid conversion of fibrinogen into a fibrin clot. As such, there is limited time to seed the tissues upon thrombin addition. To avoid premature clotting before cell-ECM mixture is transferred into the culture wells, set a p20 pipette to 15 µL before adding the thrombin. Use pre-chilled tips or dip the pipette tip into ice cold DMEM for a few seconds before collecting and transferring 15 µL of the cell-ECM mixture into each well. It is a best practice to prepare cell-ECM mixture aliquots such that no more than 6 hMMTs are seeded at a time.\nTo seed the tissues, add 15 µL of cell-ECM mixture (i.e., 150,000 cells) to each individual well. Carefully add cell-ECM mixture to the center of the oval pool and avoid pressing the pipette tip into the bottom of the well. Then, with two light motions, spread the cell suspension behind each post in the well. Once the surface is evenly coated in the cell-ECM suspension, move on to the next well.\n\t\t​NOTE: Work efficiently to avoid premature gelation of the cell-ECM mixture in the tube before all tissues are seeded. When seeding the wells, it is extremely important to avoid transferring bubbles as the bubble will interfere with the remodeling of the hMMT, rendering the hMMT unusable.\nPlace the lid on the 10 cm culture plate containing the seeded wells and transfer to a 37 °C tissue culture incubator for approximately 5 min.",
    "​NOTE: Place the microcentrifuge tube with residual cell-ECM mixture into the incubator as a confirmation of the gel polymerization process.\nAfter the cell-ECM mixture has polymerized, add 200 µL of prewarmed hMMT seeding media to each MyoTACTIC well. Replace the lid on the 10 cm dish and return MyoTACTIC plate portions within the 10 cm dish to the incubator. This time point is referred to as Day -2. Do not disturb tissues until the next step.\nDifferentiating hMMTs\n\t\nAfter 2 days of incubation, remove the hMMT seeding media carefully using a pipette and replace with 200 µL of prewarmed differentiation media containing 2% horse serum, 1% Pen/Strep, 4% ACA (i.e., 2 mg/mL final concentration from a stock concentration of 50 mg/mL; % is expressed as v/v) and 10 µg/mL human recombinant insulin in DMEM. This time point is referred to as Day 0 of differentiation.\nEvery other day thereafter, exchange half of the media with fresh differentiation media until day 12 of differentiation, the last day of culture (Figure 2a).\n\t\tNOTE: Protocol details to fabricate hMMTs using primary human myoblasts have been published elsewhere30. If there are concerns for cell viability post seeding, incubate hMMTs with calcein and propidium iodide to quantify viability.\n4. Electrical stimulation and analysis of hMMT-induced post deflection\nSet up a clear bottom glass or plastic stage mount on an inverted microscope and attach a smartphone camera to the microscope eyepiece using a microscope-camera mount. Phase contrast microscopy at 10x magnification will be used (Figure 3a).",
    "NOTE: Any inverted phase contrast microscope outfitted with a 10x magnification objective will be appropriate. The PDMS well constructs will be removed from the 10 cm dish and placed directly onto the clear bottom stage mount, and hence, open to the air. Sterilize all surfaces and equipment with 70% ethanol and minimize traffic in the area during experimentation.\nTo prepare the electrical stimulation electrodes, cut ~30 cm of tin-coated copper wire. Then, starting at the hub of a 25 G regular bevel needle, wrap ~10 cm of the wire tightly around ﻿the top half, leaving ~20 cm of excess wire. Repeat for a second needle and then cut the hub off each needle.\n\tNOTE: The wire must be tight around needle to ensure it does not move and the wire wrapped portion of the electrode must not touch the PDMS as this can impede electric field generation.\nAttach BNC to alligator clip connector cable to an output channel on the waveform generator and set the channel for square pulses with 20% duty cycle, 5 V amplitude (electrical field strength of 10 V/cm). The frequency will alter between 0.5 Hz and 20 Hz for twitch and tetanus contractions, respectively.\n\tNOTE: Waveform generator settings may require experiment-specific optimization\nPlace a MyoTACTIC plate portion containing hMMTs on the microscope stage and gently insert each electrode bevel end into the PDMS directly behind each post in the oval pool. Carefully tape down the 20 cm sections of excess wire to the microscope stage so that the needles remain vertical and ~10 cm of each wire remains free for connection (Figure 3a).",
    "CAUTION: Never place a bare finger over either end of the electrode. Ensure that a thimble is worn on the index finger to apply light pressure to the electrode on insertion into the PDMS.\nFocus the microscope field of view on one of two posts, such that focus is sharp on the post edge closest to the electrode. Then, lock the smartphone camera focus to the clearest area of the post. This is important for the downstream analysis as a change in focus while recording will interfere with analysis.\nConnect the free ends of the taped wires to the waveform generator via alligator clamps (Figure 3a).\nStart video recording on the smartphone camera, and then turn on the channel output to initiate stimulation. Induce the hMMT to undergo 3 twitch and 3 tetanus contractions, with 2 min of rest between the twitch and tetanus stimulation series.\nTurn off channel output, detach alligator clips from the tin-coated copper wires, remove the tape from the wires, and wipe each electrode with 70% ethanol before inserting into subsequent hMMT wells. Repeat procedure from step 4.5 for all hMMTs.\n\tNOTE: Limit the time that hMMTs spend outside of incubator by stimulating no more than 3 tissues at a time. If additional hMMTs within the MyoTACTIC plate portion remain to be analyzed, return the plate to the incubator for 10 min to allow hMMTs to return to 37 °C.\nTo analyze post deflection so as to calculate hMMT force generation, use the custom script, which has been made available on GitHub (https://github.com/gilbertlabcode/myoTACTIC). Follow the instructions in README.md to set up and launch the script, then open each post tracking video to conduct the force analysis.",
    "Select a region of interest (ROI) along the post edge to be tracked for post displacement. Press Enter to confirm the ROI and press Enter again to run the script (Supplemental Video 1).\n\tNOTE: Large deflections cause the tracker to fail. If the tracker fails during contraction, the ROI size can be increased to make the tracking less sensitive but permit tracking of large deflections. Three sizes are provided in the code and can be tuned by adjusting the script comments.\nThe script ends with two input requirements. First, enter y to confirm the video contained multiple contractions. Second, enter y (yes) or n (no) for exporting results to a .CSV file (Supplemental Video 1).\nEnsure post deflection results are reported as displacement in pixels for each contraction. Convert pixels to µm values for the microscope 10x magnification setting. Then, convert post displacement numbers to absolute contractile forces (µN) by multiplying values (µm) by the force-displacement conversion factor of 2.36 µN / µm, which corresponds to the 1:15 curing agent to monomer ratio of the PDMS used in MyoTACTIC fabrication30.\n5. Calcium transient analysis using electrical stimulation\nNOTE: For calcium handling experiments, immortalized myoblasts were stably transduced with the MHCK7-GCAMP6 reporter as previously described11,12. Transduced cells were FACS sorted for GFP to obtain the positive population, and then used to fabricate hMMTs. Alternative methods for calcium imaging such as using ratio-metric dyes like Fura-2 AM and Indo-1 or fluorescence lifetime imaging of calcium indicators (e.g., Fluo-4 or Oregon Green BAPTA1) may be amenable to our system.\nSet up the microscope stage and stimulation equipment (electrodes, waveform generator, etc.) as previously described in step 4. For this experiment, use a 4x magnification.\n\tNOTE: A dark room and an epifluorescence microscope equipped with a CCD camera will be needed.",
    "Launch microscope imaging software, select the FITC filter channel (blue light), and select movie recording function. Set at an exposure of 500 ms and a resolution of 680 x 510 (Binning 2x2).\n\tNOTE: Imaging software may vary and exposure is manually set by the user. Take care to avoid hMMT over exposure prior to stimulation. At rest, a dark tissue outline/shadow with spontaneous fluorescence is normal while a clear tissue image is over exposure (Supplemental Video 2). Ensure the exposure is consistent for all hMMTs within an experiment.\nClose the microscope shutter and keep the FITC channel off until ready to record calcium handling.\nWhen all equipment and software is set up, retrieve the MyoTACTIC plate portion containing the hMMTs to be analyzed and set it directly on the microscope stage. Then, insert and connect electrodes as previously described in step 4.\nUse brightfield to focus the field of view on the center of the selected hMMT. Then, turn off the lamp.\nOpen the microscope FITC channel shutter, confirm blue light is on, and then select Movie Record in the software.\nTurn on the output on the waveform generator to initiate the electrical stimulation. Induce the hMMT to undergo 8 twitch and 8 tetanus contractions. Allow for 2 min of rest between the twitch and tetanus stimulation series, during which time the FITC shutter is in the closed position.\n\tNOTE: Allow for 10 s of spontaneous activity before and after electrical stimulation to record minimum fluorescence for calculation and data analysis purposes.\nTurn off the channel output, detach alligator clips from the tin-coated copper wires, remove the tape from the wires, and wipe each electrode with 70% ethanol before inserting into subsequent hMMT wells. Repeat stimulation and recording procedure for all hMMTs.",
    "Save movies in TIFF file format for analysis in ImageJ, or alternative imaging software.\n\tNOTE: Limit the time that hMMTs spend outside of incubator by stimulating no more than 3 tissues at a time. If additional hMMT within the MyoTACTIC plate portion remain to be analyzed, return the device to the incubator for 10 min to allow hMMTs to return to 37 °C.\nTo analyze calcium transient data, first open ImageJ. Select Analyze, then Set Measurements, then select the Mean Grey Value and deselect all other options. When completed, open a calcium (.tiff) video (Supplemental Video 2).\nOutline the border of the microtissue using a polygon selection tool and save this area as the ROI (Supplemental Video 2). Under More in the ROI Manager window, select Multi Measure and measure fluorescent intensity for all file slices at one row per slice (Supplemental Video 2).\nCopy all measurements, including slice number (frame), to a spreadsheet and compare the fluorescent intensity of each slice to the minimum spontaneous fluorescent intensity from the file using ΔF/F0 = (Fimmediate - Fminimum)/Fminimum (Supplemental Video 2).\nCalculate the time for each frame by multiplying the movie recording frame speed by slice number (frame), and plot ΔF/F0 against time for the hMMT calcium transient response to stimulation (Supplemental Video 2).\nSelect the peak calcium transient signal for each of 6 consecutive contractions and average values to calculate the relative mean peak fluorescent intensity change of each hMMT (Supplemental Video 2).",
    "NOTE: Always exclude data arising from the first twitch contraction from the overall analysis. A spreadsheet entitled \"Calcium Handling Template.xlsx\" has been provided on GitHub (https://github.com/gilbertlabcode/Calcium-Handling-Template-) to facilitate the hMMT calcium transient analysis. Fillable cells where values and inputs are to be entered are highlighted in grey. Make sure to adjust peak selection numbers as this is only a guide to aid in peak selection (Supplemental Video 2).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
