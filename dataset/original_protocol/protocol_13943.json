    "All animal procedures were in accordance with the institutional guidelines of the University of Louisville and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Preparation for Slicing (One Day Before Slicing)\nPreparation of the vibrating microtome\nPlace the ceramic blade into its holder by following these steps: after carefully unwrapping the blade, place the sharp edge first into the slot of the blade tool. Then, fit the blade into the holder by loosening the two screws on the arms of the holder and slide the blade under each washer and push it firmly back against the rear stops. Tighten the screws to secure the blade.\nNOTE: The screws should not be overtightened.\nCalibrate the blade using the calibration protocol and tools according to the manufacturer's protocol.\nNOTE: Briefly, in order to facilitate alignment of the blade with the axis of travel and to minimize the Z axis deflections, the vibrating microtome uses a demountable calibration device. When the calibration device is plugged into the instrument its presence will automatically be detected, and the vibrating microtome will take control of adjusting the amplitude and frequency settings of the blade to a magnitude which best allows the adjustment of the blade alignment error.\n\t\t\nPress the Slice button to start the alignment process which will automatically move the blade so that the cutting edge is in optimal position relative to the calibration device for best alignment evaluation. Follow the on-screen instructions to make adjustments to the blade using the provided screwdriver to ensure that the Z-alignment is within 1 µm.\nAutoclave the inner bath and all the metal parts of the vibrating microtome.",
    "Autoclave the large metal trays (for collecting the slices and soaking the electrical stimulation plate covers), any glass containers, regular rectangle blades, forceps, scissors, printer timing belt (cut them into 6 mm wide pieces), metal washers and 5 L of double distilled water (ddH2O).\nSterilize one 1 L jar, one 500 mL jar and one plastic tray for the heart in situ and in vitro perfusion with the cardioplegic solution.\nPrepare 2 L of the slicing Tyrode's solution in a 2 L beaker.\nFor 1 L of the slicing Tyrode's solution, mix 3 g/L 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM), 140 mM NaCl (8.18 g), 6 mM KCl (0.447 g), 10 mM D-glucose (1.86 g), 10 mM HEPES (2.38 g), 1 mM MgCl2 (1 mL of 1 M solution), 1.8 mM CaCl2 (1.8 mL of 1 M solution), up to 1 L of ddH2O. Adjust the pH to 7.40 using NaOH. Then, filter the solution using a 1,000 mL, 0.22 µm, vacuum filter/storage system and store at 4 °C overnight.\nPrepare 4 L of the cardioplegic solution.\nFor 1 L of the cardioplegic solution, mix 110 mM NaCl (6.43 g), 1.2 mM CaCl2 (1.2 mL of 1 M solution), 16 mM KCl (1.19 g), 16 mM MgCl2 (3.25 g), 10 mM NaHCO3 (0.84 g), 1 U/mL heparin, up to 1 L of ddH2O. Adjust the pH to 7.40 using NaOH. Then, filter the solution using a 1,000 mL, 0.22 µm, vacuum filter/storage system and store at 4 °C overnight.\nNOTE: Add 1,000 U/L heparin in cardioplegia solution the day of slicing (see step 2.1).",
    "Freshly prepare 500 mL of culture medium in the original bottle in a biosafety cabinet: mix medium 199, 1x insulin-transferrin-selenium (ITS) supplement, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 5 ng/mL vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), 10 ng/mL FGF-basic, and 2x antibiotic-antimycotic. Filter sterilize through the 0.22 µm, vacuum filter/storage system and store at 4 °C overnight.\nNOTE: Do not adjust pH, add VEGF and FGF freshly before use.\nPrepare 4% agar gel plates.\nAdd 200 mL of sterilized ddH2O in a 500 mL sterilized flask. Weigh 8 g of agarose, and gently pour into the flask. Boil for 2 min in a microwave, then cool for 5 min at room temperature.\nPour 25 mL in each 100 mm Petri dish in a biosafety cabinet (prepare 6 dishes) and wait for 1 h to solidify. Then, seal the plates with paraffin film, wrap with clean wrap, and store at 4 °C.\nPrepare 4 L of 70% ethanol by diluting the 200-proof absolute ethanol in autoclaved ddH2O.\nPrepare 2x antibiotic-antimycotic in sterilized ddH2O: mix 980 mL of sterilized ddH2O with 20 mL of antibiotic-antimycotic under the biosafety cabinet.\n2. Pig Heart Perfusion\nAdd 1 mL of 1,000 U/mL heparin to each 1 L of cardioplegic solution. Keep the solution on ice.\nNOTE: At least 3 L are needed for the perfusion and preservation of the heart during the transfer to the tissue culture room.\nTake the following items to the pig surgery room: one large ice bucket full of ice, one sterilized metal tray (keep on ice bucket for heart perfusion), one sterilized 500 mL jar, one 1 L jar (to transfer the heart in cardioplegia solution back to the tissue culture room, on ice), and one sterilized plastic tray full of ice (to keep cardioplegic solution on ice).",
    "Prepare an in-situ heart perfusion system containing a 3-way stopcock, a 60 mL syringe, an 18 G butterfly needle catheter, and extension tubing to the cardioplegic solution reservoir.\nAnesthetize the Yorkshire male pig (2−3 month-old, 20−25 kg) first with an intramuscular injection of a ketamine (20 mg/kg)/xylazine (2 mg/kg) cocktail. Confirm proper anesthesia by the loss of jaw tension. Then, transfer the pig to the surgery room, intubate and mechanically ventilate the lungs as previously described14.\nMaintain anesthesia with (1.5−2%) isoflurane.\nPlace the animal on the right lateral position and shave the fur from the chest area. Clean the skin with alcohol scrub, then sterilize the surgical site with 10% (w/v) povidone-iodine solution.\nOpen the chest by left thoracotomy incision using a scalpel at the 4th intercostal space, and use a chest retractor between ribs to hold the chest open and expose the heart.\nNOTE: Use all sterilized instruments for this procedure.\nInsert the butterfly needle catheter into the left atrium and fix the needle with a purse string closure. After intravenous injection of a bolus dose of heparin (100 U/kg), start to perfuse the heart in situ with 500 mL of ice-cold cardioplegic solution (to slow down the heart rate) via the left atrial catheter.\nDeeply anesthetize the pig with 5% isoflurane. Quickly excise the heart out of the chest with surgical scissors. Cannulate the aorta with an aortic cannula and perfuse the heart in vitro with another 1 L of ice-cold cardioplegic solution (100 mL/min) to flush out vasculature blood.\nFollowing heart perfusion, keep the heart in a 1 L jar filled with ice-cold cardioplegia solution and keep on ice during the transfer to the tissue culture room.\n3. Pig Heart Tissue Slicing",
    "Set up the tissue bath on the vibratome, add ice to the tissue bath cooling jacket, then add Tyrode's solution into the tissue bath. Set up 1 L plastic jar to collect the disposal of melted ice from the tissue bath cooling jacket.\nUnder the biosafety cabinet, transfer the pig heart to a tray containing 1 L of fresh cold cardioplegic solution.\nDissect the heart to isolate the left ventricle using retractable sterile scalpels. Then, cut the left ventricle into blocks of 1−2 cm3 each using razor rectangle blades. Use one piece for slicing and keep the remaining pieces in a 50 mL tube in cold Tyrode's solution on ice for cutting later, if needed.\nNOTE: Massage the tissue before slicing with hands, especially if this is the second block. Massaging helps to restore the correct muscle fiber configuration and prevents any stiffness within the heart block.\nAdd 1−2 drops of tissue glue (Table of Materials) to the metal sample holder and stick a piece of the 4% agar block with a surface area of approximately 1 cm2.\nAdd 1−2 drops of tissue glue on the agar.\nStick the heart block to the agar with the cardiac epicardium side facing down on the tissue glue and make sure it is as flat as possible. Then, transfer the tissue holder with the heart block to its position in the slicing bath of the vibratome.\nAttach the oxygen tube to the slicing bath and the metal tray filled with Tyrode's solution for collecting the slices (oxygenated Tyrode's bath). Then, add 40 µm cell strainers in the metal tray to collect the slices after cutting.\nAdjusting the slicing position",
    "Using the vibratome operating software and the dashboard, adjust the height of the blade/sample. Select the height button and follow the on-screen instructions for adjusting the height. Ideally, have the blade close to the top of the tissue but below the papillary muscles and make sure there is liquid covering the tissue and the blade before slicing.\nAdjust where to begin slicing the tissue by selecting the advance button. Press the slice button and increase the speed using the knob to move the blade towards the edge of the tissue. Then, press slice again to stop, and press the advance button to inactivate the process.\nAdjust the cutting parameters: advance speed = 0.03 mm/s, vibration frequency = 80 Hz, and horizontal vibration amplitude = 2 mm. Then, start slicing by selecting the slice button.\nLet the vibratome slice until it reaches the end of the tissue but before it hits the back end of the specimen holder. At this point, press slice again to stop. Hit the Return button to go back to the start position.\nSelect auto repeat (clicking it twice) which will allow the vibrating microtome to auto repeat the slicing process for up to 99 times.\nCollecting slices\nWait until slices are full length and appear good (after getting past the papillary muscle layers), then start collecting the slices.\nCollect the slices using a plastic Pasteur pipette filled with cold Tyrode's solution to gently grab the tissue from the bath. If necessary, use forceps and spring scissors to dissociate the slice from the heart block if the tissue is still attached.",
    "Transfer the slice to one cell strainer in the oxygenated Tyrode's bath (see step 3.7) and use the liquid in the plastic Pasteur pipette to get the tissue to lie flat on one of the cell strainers, then add a metal washer on the top to hold the tissue down.\nNOTE: The slices need to be incubated at least for 1 h in the Tyrode's solution before processing (this is for the BDM to relax the tissue).\n4. Culturing Heart Slices\nPreparing the slices for culture\nTrim the slice from the edges to avoid any uneven edges. Then, glue it from both ends to sterilized polyurethane 6 mm wide printer timing belt with metal wires embedded using tissue glue.\nTransfer the supported heart slices to 6 well plates that contain 6 mL of culture medium in each well.\nPlace the stimulation plate cover (Table of Materials) on the top of the 6 well plate and connect the cover to the cell culture electrical stimulator (Table of Materials). Adjust the stimulator to electrically stimulate the heart slices at 10 V, 1.2 Hz continuously all the time.\n\t\tNOTE: After plugging in the stimulation, the heart slices will start to beat, and this movement will be visually obvious.\nTransfer the plates to an incubator and maintain at 37 °C with humidified air and 5% CO2.\nChange culture medium 3x per day and add 6 mL of culture medium per well during each media change.\nNOTE: Culture medium is oxygenated for 5 min prior to each media change. Medium must be changed at least 1x per day; this is okay on weekends if necessary. Two days of only 1 media change per day is the maximum that is tested.",
    "Change the stimulation plate cover every day to prevent release of toxic graphite particles in the culture medium (usually during the mid-day media change).\nRemove the stimulation plate cover from the culture dish and insert the white foam plug where the cover connects to the cable for the cell culture electrical stimulator, to prevent water damage to the electric circuit.\nPlace the plate cover in a bath of autoclaved water with 2x antibiotic-antimycotic. Keep it in this bath (i.e., rinsing bath) overnight.\nThe next day, move the plate cover into a 70% ethanol bath for 5−15 min to decontaminate. Shake off as much liquid from the device before switching baths.\nThen, transfer the plate cover to the third and final bath (i.e., clean bath), which consists of autoclaved water and 2x antibacterial-antimycotic, to rinse any remaining ethanol traces.\nAfter rinsing the plate cover in the clean bath, use a clean lint-free wipe (sprayed down with ethanol) to dry off any residual water on the plastic parts, then remove the white foam piece and carefully place the plate cover back on the culture plate.\nNOTE: Do not touch the black graphite electrodes that go into the well, as the device will no longer be sterile.\nUsing sterile forceps, make sure the tissue is in the center of the well so the plate cover does not touch the tissue. Ensure that the curved side of the plate cover matches up with the angled side of the plate and that the square corners line up.\n\t\tNOTE: To minimize contamination of the stimulation plate covers, keep them in clean and empty 6 well plates after finishing the experiment.",
