    "Hepatic portal vein cannulationDetermine mouse lean mass by ECHO-MRI according to the manufacturer’s instructions 24-48 h prior to procedure. Remove food at least 2 h prior to starting experiment, depending on study requirements.Prepare a 96-well plate containing 75 μl 2.75% ZnSO4 per well for blood collection during the procedure. Prepare enough wells for collection of blood at 6 time points per mouse. Keep plate on ice throughout the procedure. Inject mice with 80 mg/kg lean mass (determined by ECHO-MRI) pentobarbitone intraperitoneally. Mice with increased adiposity may require more pentobarbitone, up to 80 mg/kg body weight. See Videos 1 and 2.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbitone (This video was made at The University of Sydney.

Intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbitone (close up) (This video was made at The University of Sydney. Procedures were approved by The University of Sydney Animal Ethics Committee under project # 2017/1274)Assess the quality of anesthesia using the toe-pinch reflex once the animal appears to be fully unconscious. When the mouse does not respond (approximately 15-20 min after injection), place animal on back (dorsal recumbency) on a heat pad (~30 °C) and secure the limbs to the surface using tape. Note: In the event that a mouse still has a toe-pinch reflex 20 min post-anesthetic, administer up to 20% more pentobarbitone and test for toe-pinch reflex again after 10 min. Euthanize mouse if still responsive. Cut the tip (1 mm) off the tail with a scalpel blade. Take a baseline blood glucose measurement from a drop of blood taken from the tail using a glucometer. Take 5 μl blood from the tail for scintillation counting to act as a background sample.",
    "Add this 5 μl blood to one well of a 96-well plate containing 75 μl 2.75% ZnSO4. Make a 3 cm incision through the skin and peritoneum using a scalpel or surgical scissors across the midline and perpendicular up towards the rib cage to open the abdominal cavity. Avoid puncturing the diaphragm. See Video 3. Using a blunt sterile implement (e.g., cotton bud moistened with saline), carefully move the intestines to the right and the liver right and left medial lobes upward toward the ribcage to expose the hepatic portal vein and inferior vena cava (Figure 1A). See Video 3.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 3. Surgery to access the hepatic portal vein (This video was made at The University of Sydney. Procedures were approved by The University of Sydney Animal Ethics Committee under project # 2017/1274)Using a 25-29 G insulin syringe, inject a bolus of saline (for non-insulin-stimulated glucose uptake) or insulin (for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake; 1 U/kg lean body mass) containing 5-10 μCi [3H]2-DOG tracer into the hepatic portal vein (Figures 1A and 1B) or inferior vena cava if preferred. See Video 4 and Figure 1.Note: Ensure that use of radioactive material is performed following local guidelines and regulations, including appropriate use of protective equipment, safe work practices, cleaning of workspaces after experiments and waste disposal. <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 4. Administration of saline to the hepatic portal vein. (This video was made at The University of Sydney.

    "Picture of a Balb/c mouse during experiment where saline/insulin and tracer was injected via the hepatic portal vein and needle left in for the duration of the study.Measure blood glucose (from tail) and collect 5 μl blood (and add to ZnSO4 as in Step A6) per mouse to determine blood radioactivity after 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 min.After 30 min, terminate the mouse by cervical dislocation and excise tissues of interest (e.g., quadriceps muscle, tibialis anterior muscle, gastrocnemius muscle, epididymal adipose tissue, inguinal adipose tissue, heart). Tissues should be snapped frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until further analysis. Tissues can be weighed before or after freezing.Note: Mice should be culled at a time where blood tracer counts are still decreasing and have not plateaued. We typically perform 30 min ITTs.  Western blot preparationWeigh out 50 mg epididymal white adipose tissue or muscle on dry ice, keeping the tissue frozen. Add 250 μl of Western Blot Lysis Buffer to frozen tissue and immediately homogenize by sonication (90% power, 3 x 10 s, allowing sample to cool between pulses).Centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 10 min at 12 °C. Remove the supernatant for muscle tissue, or carefully remove the infranatant for adipose tissue, being careful not to disturb the lipid layer. Determine protein concentration using BCA or similar protein assay and prepare samples for Western blot as per standard protocol using phospho-specific antibodies to signaling intermediates of interest (e.g., phospho-and total Akt) (Figure 2).Note: Care should be taken to ensure that waste from SDS-PAGE is disposed of according to local regulations since samples contain radioactivity.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190114/20190114223931_9042.jpgFigure 2. Assessment of insulin signaling in adipose tissue. Adipose tissue was excised from mice administered with saline or insulin.",
    "Phosphorylation of Akt at activating sites (Thr308 and Ser473) was assessed by Western blotting with phospho-specific antibodies. Insulin increased Akt phosphorylation at both sites.Tracer disappearance and uptakeTo measure tracer disappearance from the blood, add 25 μl of a saturated Ba(OH)2 solution (in ddH2O) to wells containing blood samples in ZnSO4 (Step A5 above, final volume 105 μl). This deproteinizes the samples. Centrifuge the 96-well plate at 1,000 x g for 5 min to pellet precipitated protein and transfer 50 μl of the cleared sample to a scintillation vial and add 3 ml of scintillant. Count 3H DPM in each sample using a liquid scintillation counter. To measure tracer uptake into a tissue of interest, powder tissue in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle and then weigh an aliquot of powder for analysis. Smaller tissues such as the soleus muscle can be homogenized according to Step C3 and do not require powdering. Homogenize ~40 mg tissue (as little as 10 mg soleus and EDL muscle can be used) in 1 ml ddH2O in a 1.5 ml tube by sonication (90% power, 3 x 10 s, allowing sample to cool between pulses) and centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 15 min. Collect supernatant (~800 μl) and transfer to a new 2.0 ml tube. Bring up volume to 2 ml with ddH2O.Prepare the phospho-2-DOG affinity elution columns by adding 1 ml AG1-X8 resin diluted in ddH2O (70% volume resin) to a 0.8 x 4 cm chromatography column using a wide-bore pipette tip (e.g., P1000 tip cut 5 mm from the tip using a scalpel blade to increase the aperture). Place 5 ml tubes below the columns and add 1 ml of the supernatant to the columns followed by three 1 ml washes with ddH2O.",
    "Place new scintillation vials below the columns and add 1 ml of the elution buffer (see Recipes below) to columns followed by another 1 ml of elution buffer. Add 3 ml scintillation fluid (PerkinElmer) to the scintillation vials, vortex thoroughly, and measure 3H DPM in each sample using a liquid scintillation counter to quantify [3H]2-DOG-6-P."
