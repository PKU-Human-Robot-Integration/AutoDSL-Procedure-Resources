    "1. Molecular cloning\nNOTE: Ligase Independent Cloning (LIC) was used to make an RSV bi-cistronic coexpression construct plasmid. LIC is a method developed in the early 1990s, which uses the 3’-5’ Exo activity of the T4 DNA  polymerase to create overhangs with complementarity between the vector and the DNA insert21,22. The constructs were made using the 2BT-10 vector DNA, which consists of a 10x His tag at the N-terminal of the Open Reading Frame (ORF) (Figure 1).\nPerform linearization of LIC vectors using SSPI digestion.\n\t\nCombine 10 μL of SSPI 10X buffer, 4 μL of SSPI enzyme at a concentration of 5 U/μL, the equivalent volume of 5 μg of vector miniprep DNA, and sterile ddH2O to 100 μL.\nIncubate the digest for 3 hours at 37 °C.\nRun the digest on a 1.0% agarose gel for the extraction of vector DNA.\nUse a gel extraction kit to perform extraction and purification. Suspend the final volume of vector DNA in 30 μL of ddH2O and store it at -20 °C.\nPrepare the DNA inserts for N1-391 and P1-126 using the N1-391 Forward Primer, N1-391 Reverse Primer, P1-126 Forward Primer, and P1-126 Reverse Primer (Table 1).\n\tNOTE: There is sufficient overlap with the linearized vector to ensure a melting temperature of between 55 °C and 60 °C. For the reverse primer, there is sufficient overlap with the reverse complementary strand of the linearized vector for the same reason.\n\t\nPerform PCR amplification of the DNA insert using the conditions in Table 2 and Table 3.\nExtract the amplified DNA insert. Run the PCR products from the previous step on a 1.0% agarose gel, then extract and purify the bands by gel extraction. Suspend the final volume of extracted DNA in 15 μL of ddH2O.",
    "T4 DNA polymerase treatment of vector and insert DNA (Table 4).\n\tNOTE: Treatment must be performed separately for the vector DNA and the insert DNA.\n\t\nIncubate the mixture for 40 minutes at room temperature. Then, heat-inactivate the polymerase at 75 °C for 20 minutes. Store the reaction mixture at -20 °C.\nAnneal the LIC vector and the insert vector.\n\t\nSet up a negative control with 2 μL of LIC vector DNA and 2 μL of sterile ddH2O.\nCombine  2 μL of insert DNA and 2 μL of LIC vector DNA from the previous T4 DNA polymerase reactions in a 0.2 mL tube.\nPerform the annealing reaction at room temperature for 10 minutes.\nQuench the reaction with 1.3 μL of EDTA at a concentration of 25 mM.\nTransform the reaction into 100 μL of E. coli Top10 competent cells and plate them on an ampicillin selection plate23,24.\nIdentify the positive constructs.\n\t\nPrepare the plasmid miniprep solution. This can be done through colony picking and inoculation in LB media. Usually, 3 colonies are sufficient.\nIncubate the mixture overnight at 37 °C.\nCentrifuge the mixture at 4,560 x g for 10 minutes and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellets in 250 μL of P1 buffer and prepare plasmid minipreps using a spin miniprep kit.\nConduct a digestion analysis of the miniprep product using AseI or other restriction enzymes.\nLoad samples on 0.8% agarose gel and run the digested plasmid. Analyze the gel under a UV lamp.\nUse a sequencing service to validate the sequence of the positive product.\nObtain the coexpression DNA insert.\n\t\nPerform PCR to obtain N1-391 and P1-126 using the previously constructed 2BT-10 N1-391 and 2BT-10 P1-126 as templates.",
    "Perform the 1st PCR to obtain N1-391 from the 2BT-10 N1-391 construct using the PCR conditions in Table 2 and Table 3 with the N1-391 Forward primer and Reverse Primer  5 ́-GTGAAGATCCTGGCTGATGCAATGCGGCGGCG\n\t\tCGCCGCGATCGCGGATCC-3 ́.\nPerform the 2nd PCR to obtain P1-126 from the 2BT-10 P1-126 construct using the Forward primer: 5’-CCGCCGCATTGCATCAGCCAGGATCTTCACTGC\n\t\tAGGACTCGAGTTCTAGA-3 ́and the P1-126 Reverse primer (use the PCR conditions in Table 2 and Table 3).\nFinally, perform overlap PCR on the mixed products of the previous 2 PCR reactions to merge N1-391 and P1-126. Use the  N1-391 Forward primer and P1-126 Reverse primer. Use the PCR conditions in Table 5 and Table 6.\nJoin the vector and the DNA insert.\n\t\nTreat the overlap PCR product with T4 DNA polymerase following the protocol in step 1.3.\nAnneal the LIC vector and PCR product following the protocol in step 1.4.\nIdentify the positive constructs following the protocol in step 1.5.\n2. Protein expression and purification\nNOTE: Use E. coli for the bi-cistronic construct of the coexpression of both N and P. Culture the cells at 37 °C, but carry out the expression at a reduced temperature (16 °C) overnight. Purify the protein complexes through a combination of cobalt column, ion exchange, and size exclusion chromatography (Figure 2).\nUse the E. coli BL21(DE3) strain for protein production. Grow 4 L cell cultures at 37 °C in LB (Luria Broth) medium until OD600 reaches 0.6.\nLower the temperature to 16 °C. An hour later, induce the expression with 0.5 mM isopropyl 1-thio--D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) overnight.\nCentrifuge the cells at 4,104 x g for 25 min and then discard the supernatant.",
    "Resuspend the cell pellets in 200 mL of lysis buffer A (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, and 0.2% NP40). Use 50 mL of lysis buffer to resuspend the cell pellets from 1 L of cell culture.\nLyse the cells by sonication for 15 min, 3 seconds on, and 3 seconds off. Then centrifuge cells at 37,888 x g for 40 min.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused by freezing the cells before sonication in a -80 °C freezer.\nLoad the supernatant into a cobalt gravity column (diameter x length: 2.5 cm x 10 cm) with ~10mL of beads pre-equilibrated with 5-10 column volumes (CV) of lysis buffer.\nWash the column with 5 CV of buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1 M NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 5 mM imidazole) and 5 CV of buffer C (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 5 mM imidazole).\nElute the protein from the beads using 2 CV of buffer D (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, and 250 mM imidazole).\nDilute the eluted protein 5x with QA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 5% Glycerol) for the Q column.\nWash the 5 mL of Q column with QA buffer to equilibrate the column, then load the diluted sample into the Q column using the peristaltic pump (e.g., Rabbit).\nLoad the Q column into the HPLC machine along with QA buffer and QB buffer(50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.4, 1.5 M NaCl, 5% glycerol). Set up the flow rate as 1 mL/min.\nRun the “pump wash” program to wash the machine with QB buffer followed by QA buffer (1-2 CVs/each). Set the system flow to 3 mL/min.",
    "Set the UV1 to 280 nm and UV2 to 260 nm. Use a 96 deep-well plate to collect the fractions.\nElute proteins using a stepwise gradient of elution agent (QB Buffer) applying 3-4 CV of each concentration, increasing the percentage by 5% each time starting at 0% QB. N0P  protein complex will come out at 15% QB Buffer.\nOnce all of the protein is eluted, wash the column with 100% QB Buffer (2 CV).\nIsolate the protein by gel filtration Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (diameter x length: 1.0 cm x 30 cm) and equilibrate with buffer E (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4 and 200 mM NaCl).\nAnalyze protein-containing fractions by SDS-PAGE.\n3. In vitro assembly of the virus-specific NC \nNOTE: The in vitro assembly of the RSV-specific NC (N:RNA) was performed by incubating the prepared N0P complex with RNA oligos. Then, SEC chromatography was used to separate the assembly complex from the N0P and excess RNA (Figure 2).\nMix and incubate the purified N0P complex with RNA oligo with the molecular ratio of 1:1.5 at room temperature for 1 hour, usually 1 mL of the protein N0P with a concentration of 1 mg/mL is enough for the next step. Set up the control sample, which only contains the same amount of N0P protein.\nPre-equilibrate the gel filtration Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column with the buffer E (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl).\nCentrifuge the sample with 21,130 x g for 15 min, remove any precipitation and load the supernatant to the SEC column.\nCompare the SEC chromatography images of N:RNA assembly sample and N0P control sample, combine the A260/A280 ratio to identify which peaks are the assembled N-RNA, N0P, and free RNA.\nCollect the peak fractions, run the SDS-PAGE gel, or make grids.",
    "For the assembly N-RNA complex, collect all the fractions of N-RNA peak, do the RNA extraction and run the Urea-PAGE gel to double-check the length of specific RNA, which is the same as mixed and incubated at the first step.\n4. Making negative stain grids\nNOTE: Negative stain electron microscopy (EM) is a method in which the molecules are adsorbed to a carbon film and then embedded in a layer of heavy metal atoms. Negative stain EM produces a high image contrast, making it easy to see and computationally align the particles. Another advantage is that the adsorption of the particles to a carbon film usually induces the molecules to adhere to the grid with few preferred orientations. When the molecules are in a similar orientation, it is easy to separate them into structurally distinct classes. Negative stain EM is thus the appropriate technique to guide sample preparation25,26 (Figure 3).\nMicrowave or heat 5 mL of ddH2O in a small glass beaker using a Tungsten heater until it is boiling. \nWeigh 37.5 mg of uranyl formate and add to 5 mL of heated ddH2O to make a 0.75% uranyl formate staining solution. Stir under an aluminum foil covered beaker to protect from light.\nAdd 4 μL of 10 M NaOH to the staining solution and continue to stir for 15 min, protected from the light.\nFilter the solution through a 0.22 mm filter into a test tube.\nUse glow discharge to make the continuous carbon-coated EM grids hydrophilic27.\n\tNOTE: The grids are placed inside a chamber connected to a power supply. When high voltage is applied, the gas within the chamber ionizes, and the negatively charged ions deposit on the carbon grids to make them hydrophilic.",
    "Cut and fold a parafilm strip. Pipet 2 drops of 40 μL of the buffer on one side of the parafilm, and pipet another 2 drops of 40 μL of staining solution to the other side.\nTo make the EM carbon grids, apply 3 μL of protein sample for 1 minute.\nBlot the grids against a blotting paper.\n\tNOTE: The grids are washed 2x with buffer, and 1x with the 0.75% uranyl formate staining solution blotted after each step.\nHold the grid surface in the second drop of 0.75% uranyl formate staining solution for 30 seconds.\nBlot the grid against a blotting paper to remove excess stain solution and allow the grid to air-dry.\nStore the grids in the grid box before imaging.\nSubscription Required.
