    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nsgRNA selection and primer design for transposable element deletion\nTiming: 45 min\nSelect two sgRNAs and order primers for cloning them into the pCFD5 plasmid (Addgene: 73914). This plasmid allows the expression of multiple sgRNAs under the control of the strong ubiquitous RNA pol III promoter U6:3.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] sgRNAs should be designed to target the 5′ and 3′ most proximal regions flanking the TE to be deleted. We will exemplify the procedure using the FBti0019985 TE insertion of D. melanogaster (423 bp), which has been successfully deleted using this two-step protocol in Merenciano and Gonzalez, 2023.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nGet the nucleotide sequence of the TE insertion that you want to delete including 500 bp of each flanking region. For D. melanogaster, it can be found in FlyBase (http://flybase.org/[href=http://flybase.org/]).5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nCopy and paste the nucleotide sequence into a CRISPR target finder tool such as http://targetfinder.flycrispr.neuro.brown.edu/[href=http://targetfinder.flycrispr.neuro.brown.edu/].\nSelect the reference genome of the species of interest. Following the example, select “Drosophila melanogaster.” Select a guide length of 20 nucleotides and find “all CRISPR targets”. Click on “Find CRISPR targets”.\nOn the next page, select “High Stringency” and “NGG only” for PAM.\nChoose a pair of sgRNAs with no predicted off-target sites and located in the closest upstream and downstream flanking regions of the TE insertion, respectively. For FBti0019985 deletion, we chose the following sgRNA pair: sgRNA1 5′-tatctcaaataagtctagct-3′ and sgRNA2 5′-cagagaaacgtcgagctgcg-3’.\nCritical: if the closest sgRNAs to the TE insertion have predicted off-target sites, choose other sgRNAs. If off-target sites are unavoidable, choose sgRNAs with off-targets in a different chromosome from the genomic region of interest.",
    "Note: to ensure that no SNPs that could prevent an effective Cas9 cleavage are present in the chosen target regions, we strongly recommend to sequence the genomic region including the selected sgRNAs of the strain to be injected.\nDesign and order desalted primers for cloning the sgRNAs into the pCFD5 plasmid following the pCFD5 cloning protocol found in http://www.crisprflydesign.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pCFD5cloningprotocol.pdf[href=http://www.crisprflydesign.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pCFD5cloningprotocol.pdf].\nNote: primers should always include the same homology arms to the pCFD5 plasmid for their assembly and the sgRNA sequence in the middle. For FBti0019985 deletion, the forward primer for cloning sgRNA1 is 5′-gcggcccgggttcgattcccggccgatgcatatctcaaataagtctagctgttttagagctagaaatagcaag-3′ and the reverse primer for cloning the sgRNA2 is 5′-attttaacttgctatttctagctctaaaaccagagaaacgtcgagctgcgtgcaccagccgggaatcgaaccc-3’. These primers contain the sgRNA1 and sgRNA2 sequences (underlined), respectively.\nRepair plasmid and primer design for transposable element deletion\nTiming: 1 h",
    "To generate a precise deletion of the TE insertion, and to facilitate the screening of positive CRISPR/Cas9 deletion events, a repair plasmid for homology-directed repair must be designed and microinjected together with the pCFD5 plasmid containing the sgRNAs. The repair plasmid will be derived from the pHD-ScarlessDsRed plasmid (Addgene: 64703). This plasmid contains a 3xP3-DsRed marker cassette flanked by piggy-PBac transposon ends and is usually used to generate targeted modifications with a minimal locus disruption due to the marker cassette removal through a single cross with a strain containing a piggy-PBac transposase. In this protocol, the introduction of this plasmid thus allows the substitution of the TE by a visual marker that facilitates the screening of positive CRISPR events. The DsRed marker allows the selection based on the DsRed fluorescent signal in the adult eye and in the ocelli. Two homology arms are needed to produce recombination between the repair plasmid and the genome. Each homology arm must be ∼1000 bp. The boundaries of the right (5′) and left (3′) homology arms must be the right and left boundaries of the TE insertion, respectively. Crucially, the PAM sequence (NGG) corresponding to the two targeted regions must be modified in the homology arms to avoid Cas9 cutting the repair plasmid.\nDesign and order primers for the cloning of the 5′ and 3′ homology arms in the flanking regions of the 3xP3-DsRed marker cassette.\nIdentify ∼1000 bp of the nucleotide sequence of each flanking region of the TE insertion in the strain to be injected, which will correspond to the 5′ and 3′ homology arms, respectively. For FBti0019985 deletion, 5′ homology arm contained the sequence in 2R:9870299-9871095 (FlyBase Release 6) while the 3′ homology arm contained the sequence in 2R:9871529-9872365 (FlyBase Release 6).",
    "Note: DNA sequences can be visualized using the software SnapGene viewer or any other sequence viewer.\nDownload the sequence of the pHD-ScarlessDsRed plasmid (https://flycrispr.org/scarless-gene-editing/[href=https://flycrispr.org/scarless-gene-editing/]) and identify the sequence of the 3xP3-DsRed marker cassette and the sequence of the pHD-ScarlessDsRed backbone.\nUse the NEBuilder Assembly Tool (https://nebuilder.neb.com/#!/[href=https://nebuilder.neb.com/]) to design the primers for the assembly of the homology arms into the pHD-ScarlessDsRed plasmid (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2924-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic representation of the repair plasmids\n(A) Schematic representation of the pHD-ScarlessDsRed repair plasmid for TE deletion (FBti0019985).\n(B) Schematic representation of the pHD-Scarless repair plasmid for visual marker DsRed deletion. Primers are represented by arrows not in scale.\nIntroduce the nucleotide sequence of all the different fragments to be assembled (5′ homology arm, 3xP3-DsRed marker cassette, 3′ homology arm and pHD-ScarlessDsRed plasmid backbone obtained in steps 4a-b).\nNote: be sure that the fragments are in the correct order, being the 3xP3-DsRed marker cassette between the two homology arms.\nFollow the NEBuilder Assembly Tool instructions to obtain the primer sequences that will allow the introduction of both homology arms into the repair plasmid. For FBti0019985 deletion, primer sequences can be found in the “key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]” (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).",
    "Critical: use the designed primers to modify the two PAM sequences in the homology arms (corresponding to the two target regions) in order to avoid Cas9 cutting the repair plasmid. We recommend changing the second nucleotide of the PAM region (NGG) since Cas9 can sometimes recognize other PAMs like NGA. If the PAM to be mutated is in a genic region, try not to create a non-synonymous mutation that could in turn affect the coding capacity of the gene. To modify the PAM sequences, two strategies can be followed depending on the position of the PAM in the homology arms. The first is to extend one primer sequence until the closest PAM region and modify it to not contain the NGG sequence (the total primer sequence should not exceed 75 bp). In the example, we modified the PAM region of the 3′ homology arm (G > T) following this strategy. However, if the PAM region is not close enough to the primer sequence, we recommend splitting the homology arm in two fragments. In that case, go back to step 4c and introduce the sequences of all fragments to be assembled. After that, modify the sequence of the desired primers to not contain the NGG sequence of the PAM. In the example, we modified the PAM region of the 5′ homology arm (G > C) following this strategy, thus having two fragments for this homology arm: 5′HAa and 5′HAb (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).",
    "Optional: a single sgRNA can be design and cloned into pCFD5 if the nearby region of the insertion does not contain any gene that could be disrupted by the introduction of the marker. In this case, the visual marker will be introduced by homology directed repair nearby the TE insertion. This has the advantage of performing a single cut, rather than two in the TE flanking regions. Both the TE and the visual marker can be removed later in the second step of the protocol.\nOptional: some extra nucleotides can be added to the DsRed_fwd1 and DsRed_rev1 primers to artificially generate both a PAM region (NGG) and a sgRNA target site in the flanking regions of the 3xP3-DsRed marker cassette. This will allow the removal of the 3xP3-DsRed marker cassette in the second CRISPR/Cas9 homology-directed repair step without introducing SNPs in the PAM regions needed to prevent an effective Cas9 cleavage of the repair plasmid.\nsgRNA cloning for transposable element deletion\nTiming: 3–4 days\nIn this step, sgRNAs for TE deletion are cloned into the pCFD5 plasmid following the protocol described in http://www.crisprflydesign.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pCFD5cloningprotocol.pdf[href=http://www.crisprflydesign.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pCFD5cloningprotocol.pdf].\nDigest the pCFD5 plasmid with BbsI-HF restriction enzyme at 37°C for 2–16 h.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2924_4.csv\nRun a PCR with the primer pair obtained in step 3 (sgRNA1 forward and sgRNA2 reverse primers) using the pCFD5 circularized plasmid as a template.

    "(B) Schematic representation of the PCR validation to check for the absence of the TE in the genomic DNA of the transformant flies.\nValidate by PCR that the TE substitution by the visual marker has been produced, and in the genomic region desired, performing two PCR reactions. One with the forward TE_verif_fwd and reverse TE_verif_rev primer pair spanning the whole substituted region (PCR 1, Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A); and another PCR reaction with the forward TE_verif_fwd and the pHD-SV40-F primer (inside DsRed sequence) to verify that the previous PCR 1 result is due to the TE substitution by the DsRed fluorescent marker and not due to other undesired rearrangement events (PCR 2, Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nNote: PCR 1 of selected transformants is expected to give two bands, as F1 transformants should be heterozygous for the mutation. One band corresponds to the substituted allele TE-, and the other band to the TE+ allele from the maternal natural population. However, PCR 2 is expected to give a single band, meaning that the TE insertion has been substituted by the DsRed fluorescent marker. For PCR reaction mixture and PCR conditions, refer to step 11. Verify the TE substitution by Sanger sequencing the PCR products.\nGenerate a homozygous strain absent for the TE insertion (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nF2 flies can be TE+/TE+, TE+/TE-, or TE-/TE-. TE+/TE+ F2 flies do not display red fluorescence and thus, they can be discarded.\nSelf-cross flies from F2 that display red fluorescence (TE+/TE- or TE-/TE-) individually. We recommend performing at least 10 crosses to maximize the chances to obtain TE-/TE- x TE-/TE- crosses.\nNote: sometimes TE+/TE+ homozygous flies can be carefully selected based on the brightness on the eyes.\nRepeat step 27 to extract the genomic DNA from the F2 flies (both males and females).",
    "Note: TE+/TE- flies will produce two bands in PCR 1, and a single band in PCR 2 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). However, TE-/TE- flies will produce a single band in PCR 1, and also a single band in PCR 2 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nRepeat step 30 to validate by PCR the TE deletion in both alleles.\nKeep the cross in which both F2 parents are homozygous for the TE deletion.\nPause point: the homozygous CRISPR-mutant without the TE insertion can be kept in vials with fresh food as many generations as needed until the next injection (step 38). However, if you are going to proceed with the protocol, you can start to expand it (step 37).\nNote: steps 32–36 can be done simultaneously with step 31.\nsgRNA selection and primer design for visual marker deletion\nTiming: 45 min\nSelect two sgRNAs for DsRed deletion and order primers for cloning them into the pCFD5 plasmid. This time, sgRNAs should be designed to target the 3xP3-DsRed marker cassette flanking regions.\nGet the nucleotide sequence of the 3xP3-DsRed marker cassette (1691 bp) from the previously generated pHD-ScarlessDsRed repair plasmid (obtained in step 30) including 500 bp of each flanking region (corresponding to the homology arms).\nFollow the steps 2 and 3 to design and order primers for cloning the sgRNAs into the pCFD5 plasmid. For DsRed deletion, we chose the following sgRNA pair: sgRNA3 5′-ttgaacactaatgacaattt-3′ and sgRNA4 5′-gagctgcgcagttgtgagct-3’. The forward primer for cloning sgRNA3 is 5′-gcggcccgggttcgattcccggccgatgcttgaacactaatgacaatttgttttagagctagaaatagcaag-3′ and the reverse primer for cloning the sgRNA4 is 5′-attttaacttgctatttctagctctaaaacagctcacaactgcgcagctctgcaccagccgggaatcgaaccc-3’. These primers contain the sgRNA3 and sgRNA4 sequences (underlined), respectively.\nRepair plasmid and primer design for visual marker deletion\nTiming: 1 h",
    "Again, the new repair plasmid for homology-directed repair will be derived from the pHD-ScarlessDsRed plasmid. This time, the 3xP3-DsRed marker cassette is deleted and only two homology arms for homology-directed repair are inserted. Both homology arms must be ∼1000 bp each. The boundaries of the right (5′) and left (3′) homology arms must be the right and left boundaries of the 3xP3-DsRed marker cassette in the previously generated CRISPR/Cas9-mutated strain without the TE insertion, respectively. Crucially, the PAM sequence (NGG) corresponding to the designed sgRNAs must be modified in the new homology arms to avoid Cas9 cutting the repair plasmid. The introduction of this plasmid thus allows the removal of the DsRed fluorescent marker producing, at the end of the protocol, a precise deletion of the desired TE insertion in D. melanogaster natural populations.\nDesign and order primers for the removal of the 3xP3-DsRed marker cassette and the insertion of the 5′ and 3′ homology arms into the pHD-ScarlessDsRed plasmid (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nIdentify ∼1000 bp of the nucleotide sequence of both flanking regions of the 3xP3-DsRed marker cassette in the previously generated CRISPR-mutant strain without the TE insertion. These sequences have been obtained in step 30.\nUse the NEBuilder Assembly Tool (https://nebuilder.neb.com/#!/[href=https://nebuilder.neb.com/]) to design the primers for the assembly of the homology arms into the pHD-ScarlessDsRed plasmid (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nIntroduce the nucleotide sequence of all the different fragments to be assembled (5′ homology arm, 3′ homology arm and pHD-ScarlessDsRed plasmid backbone without the 3xP3-DsRed marker cassette).\nNote: be sure that the fragments are in the correct order (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nFollow the NEBuilder Assembly Tool instructions to obtain the primer sequences that will allow the introduction of both homology arms into the repair plasmid. For DsRed deletion, primer sequences can be found in the “key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]” (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).",
    "Critical: use the designed primers to modify the two PAM sequences in the homology arms (corresponding to the two target regions) in order to avoid Cas9 cutting the repair plasmid. We recommend changing the second nucleotide of the PAM region (NGG) since Cas9 can sometimes recognize other PAMs like NGA. If the PAM to be mutated is in a genic region, try not to create a non-synonymous mutation that could in turn affect the coding capacity of the gene. To modify the PAM sequences, two strategies can be followed depending on the position of the PAM in the homology arms. The first is to extend one primer sequence until the closest PAM region and modify it to not contain the NGG sequence (the total primer sequence should not exceed 75 bp). In the example, we modified the PAM region of the 3′ homology arm (G > A) following this strategy. However, if the PAM region is not close enough to the primer sequence, we recommend splitting the homology arm in two fragments. In that case, go back to step 34b and introduce the sequences of all fragments to be assembled. After that, modify the sequence of the desired primer to not contain the NGG sequence of the PAM. In the example, we modified the PAM region of the 5′ homology arm (G > A) following this strategy, thus having two fragments for this homology arm: 5′HAa and 5′HAb (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nsgRNA cloning for visual marker deletion\nTiming: 3–4 days\nIn this step, sgRNAs for DsRed deletion are cloned into the pCFD5 plasmid following the protocol described in http://www.crisprflydesign.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pCFD5cloningprotocol.pdf[href=http://www.crisprflydesign.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pCFD5cloningprotocol.pdf].",

    "Microinject a minimum of 500 embryos with the injection mix containing the new pCFD5 plasmid (100 ng/μL), the new pHD-Scarless repair plasmid (500 ng/μL) and the pnos-Cas9-nos plasmid (250 ng/μL) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). For DsRed deletion, a total of 550 embryos were microinjected, and of those, 168 hatched. A detailed protocol for embryo microinjection can be found in http://gonzalezlab.eu/two-step-crispr-cas9-protocol[href=http://gonzalezlab.eu/two-step-crispr-cas9-protocol]\nNote: recommended concentrations are 100–500 ng/μL for pCFD5, 500 ng/μL for pHD-Scarless repair plasmid, and 250–500 ng/μL for pnos-Cas9-nos plasmid. Prepare a final volume of 20 μL of injection mix. This injection mix can be stored at −20°C until further use.\nNote: several batches of embryos can be microinjected to increase the probability to find transformants.\nInjected embryos are grown to adulthood in vials with fresh fly food medium and individually crossed to flies of the opposite sex from the natural population (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). For DsRed deletion, a total of 94 flies emerged and 67 fertile crosses were established.\nScreen for no DsRed fluorescent signal in the next generation (F1) adult eyes/ocelli (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).

    "Design a pair of primers for the PCR verification, such that one of each primer binds just outside the regions that correspond to the 5′ and 3′ homology arms. For DsRed deletion validation, we used the TE_verif_fwd and TE_verif2_rev primers (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). Primer sequences can be found in the “key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]”.\nValidate by PCR the visual marker deletion in F1 with the primers from the previous step.\nNote: this PCR reaction of non-fluorescent selected transformants is expected to give two bands, as F1 transformants should be heterozygous for the mutation. One band corresponds to the TE- and DsRed deleted allele, while the other corresponds to the TE + allele from the maternal natural population (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). For PCR reaction mixture and PCR conditions, refer to step 11. Verify the marker deletion and the subsequent homology-directed repair by Sanger sequencing the PCR product.\nBackcross the selected flies for a minimum of 5 generations with the natural population to remove possible off-targets.\nNote: in each generation, set up crosses with only the flies that present no fluorescence and keep vials only after the TE heterozygosity has been validated by PCR (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nNote: it is necessary to validate by PCR that the flies are heterozygous for the presence of the TE insertion in every generation. The number of backcrossed generations can be reduced, reducing the time of generation of a homozygous strain, although the probability to keep off-target mutations will increase.\nGenerate a homozygous strain absent for the TE insertion (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nSelf-cross flies from F6 (TE+/TE-) individually. Their offspring (F7) can be TE+/TE+, TE+/TE-, or TE-/TE-.\nSelf-cross flies from F7 individually. We recommend performing at least 10 crosses to maximize the chances to obtain TE-/TE- x TE-/TE- crosses.",
    "Repeat step 42 to extract the genomic DNA from the F7 flies (both males and females). TE+/TE- flies will produce two bands, while TE-/TE- flies will produce a single band (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nRepeat step 44 to validate by PCR the absence of the TE in both alleles.\nKeep the cross in which both F7 parents are homozygous for the absence of the TE."
