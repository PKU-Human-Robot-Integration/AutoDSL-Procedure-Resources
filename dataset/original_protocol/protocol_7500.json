    "Passaging of mouse embryonic stem cells In a Falcon tube, prepare 4.5 mL of mESC maintenance medium (without CHIR99021, PD0325901, and LIF) to collect cells in. In a separate tube, prepare 3 mL of s2iL medium (see Recipe 1).Check mESCs under microscope. The colonies should be round and not touching each other (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4722/bioprotoc-13-14-4722-g001.jpgFigure 1. Representative immunofluorescence image of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) grown in s2iL medium stained for SOX2 (green) and F-Actin (red) (left panel), and KLF4 (green) and TFCP2L1 (red) (right panel). Scale bars = 200 µm.Remove medium from the mESCs and wash with 2 mL of PBS (without calcium and magnesium).Add 550 μL of room-temperature accutase for dissociation. Incubate for 2–3 min at room temperature. Gently tap the plate to lift up colonies.Pipette up and down 10–15 times to dissociate colonies into single cells. Make sure cells are single by checking under the microscope.Place the cell suspension in previously prepared 4.5 mL of mESC maintenance medium.Spin down at 200× g (1,000 rpm) for 5 min.Remove supernatant and resuspend in 1 mL of s2iL medium.Count cells with hemocytometer or automated cell counter.Seed 50,000–60,000 cells per well of 6-well plate in s2iL medium. Distribute cells equally by shaking the plate back and forth and left and right.Place the plate back in the incubator and culture for two or three days at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 21% O2.Preparing EPI aggregates on PEG microwells Carefully remove PBS from PEG microwells (400 μm well diameter, 121 wells per array) without touching the hydrogel.Add 50 μL of EPI differentiation medium on top of the array and place the microwells in the incubator for at least 30 min to equilibrate.Meanwhile, remove medium from the mESCs and wash with 2 mL of PBS (without calcium and magnesium).",
    "Add 550 μL of room-temperature accutase. Incubate for 2–3 min at room temperature. Gently tap the plate to lift up colonies.Pipette up and down 10–15 times to dissociate colonies into single cells.Place the cell suspension in previously prepared 4.5 mL of mESC maintenance medium.Spin down at 200× g (1,000 rpm) for 5 min.Remove supernatant and resuspend in 10 mL of PBS.Spin down at 200× g (1,000 rpm) for 5 min.Remove supernatant and resuspend in 10 mL of PBS.Spin down at 200× g (1,000 rpm) for 5 min.Resuspend in appropriate volume of EPI differentiation medium to obtain a cell suspension of 484,000 cells/mL.Carefully remove the 50 μL of EPI differentiation medium from the microwell arrays and add 35 μL of cell suspension, to have 100–150 cells per each well of the microwell array.Do not shake or swirl the plate as it will disturb the equal segregation of cells. Incubate at 37 °C for 30 min for cells to sediment.Slowly add 1 mL of EPI differentiation medium or EPI+XAV differentiation medium (see Recipe 2) from the notch. Do not dispense liquid directly on the microwell array, as it will cause cells to lift up.Place the plate back in the incubator and culture for at least 72 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 21% O2. Cells should sediment at the bottom of microwells and form clumps within an hour of seeding (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4722/bioprotoc-13-14-4722-g002.jpgFigure 2. Representative images showing mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) seeded at indicated numbers at 0 h and resulting in EPI or EPI+XAV aggregates at 72 h. Scale bar = 200 μm.Transferring EPI aggregates into 96-well plates At approximately 75 h of culture, carefully remove the EPI differentiation medium from the microwells.",
    "Dispense 1 mL of fresh N2B27 directly on the microwell array at different locations to lift EPI aggregates up.Collect EPI aggregates in non-tissue culture–treated 10 cm dishes. Repeat the collection with 1 mL of N2B27 five times. Add 5 mL of N2B27 directly to the 10 cm dish to add up to 10 mL.Observe EPI aggregates under the microscope. It is advised to do the picking under sterile conditions, under the cell culture hood.Pick EPI aggregates under the microscope in 10 μL and dispense directly in a well of ultra-low attachment 96-well plate filled with 180 μL of N2B27. Make sure that transferred EPI aggregates are not damaged and maintain smooth edges.Repeat this step until the 96-well plate is completely filled. It usually takes 30 min to 1 h to fill a full plate.Place the plate in the incubator.Every 24 h until 168 h, change 150 μL of medium with fresh N2B27 using a multichannel pipette (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4722/bioprotoc-13-14-4722-g003.jpgFigure 3. Montage of EPI or EPI+XAV aggregates formed from 100 cells/well shown at 144 h and 168 h after segmentation. T/Bra expression is shown in red. Sox1 expression is shown in green. Note the Sox1-positive domain localized on the opposite end of T/Bra-positive domain in EPI+XAV aggregates.Preparing gastruloids Follow steps B1–B11.Resuspend in appropriate volume of N2B27 medium to obtain a cell suspension of 7,500 cells/mL. For example, 37,500 cells should be added in 5 mL of N2B27 to prepare a full 96-well plate of gastruloids.Add 40 μL of the cell suspension per well of a 96-well plate using a multichannel pipette to target 300 cells/well. Place the plate in the incubator for 48 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 21% O2.At 48 h, prepare 15 mL of N2B27 with 3 μM of CHIR99021. Add 150 μL per well.",
    "Note that the final CHIR99021 concentration is 2.36 μM. Place the plate back in the incubator.At 72 h, gently flush gastruloids to lift up shed cells. Wait 1 min for the main aggregate to sediment. Carefully remove 150 μL of medium and add exact volume of fresh N2B27 medium.Repeat step D5 every 24 h until 168 h (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4722/bioprotoc-13-14-4722-g004.jpgFigure 4. Montage of a full 96-well plate of gastruloids at 168 h after segmentation. T/Bra expression is shown in red. Note the autofluorescent signal over the darker, anterior regions. Scale bars = 200 μm.Immunostaining and imaging Collect EPI aggregates and gastruloids from 96-well plates with a cut 1,000 μL pipette tip and transfer to low attachment 6-well plates in 3 mL of PBS/well. Incubate for 10 min at room temperature.Transfer into a new well containing 3 mL of 4% PFA and fix for 2 h at 4 °C.After fixation, transfer into new wells to do three serial PBS washes (3 mL) of 20 min at room temperature. It is very important to coat the pipette tips with coating solution (PBS + 10% FBS) before transferring fixed aggregates, to prevent sticking on the walls of the tip.Transfer into a new well containing 3 mL of blocking solution (PBS + 10% FBS + 0.3% Triton X-100) and incubate for 1 h at room temperature.Transfer to low attachment 24-well plates in 300 μL of blocking solution containing primary antibodies and DAPI. List of primary antibodies used can be found in Table 1. Incubate for at least 24 h at 4 °C on a shaker. Cover the plate with aluminum foil to preserve fluorescence intensity of the reporters.Next day, transfer back to low attachment 6-well plate and wash away primary antibodies by three serial PBS washes (3 mL) of 20 min at room temperature.",
    "Transfer to low attachment 24-well plates in 300 μL of blocking solution containing secondary antibodies (Table 1) and DAPI. Incubate for at least 24 h at 4 °C on a shaker. Cover the plate with aluminum foil to preserve fluorescence intensity of the reporters.Next day, transfer back to low attachment 6-well plate and wash away secondary antibodies by three serial PBS washes (3 mL) of 20 min at room temperature.Carefully aspirate aggregates in 100 μL and place them on glass slide. Remove excess PBS around without touching the aggregates. Add 20–30 μL of mounting medium dropwise. Place the coverslip on top and seal with nail polish. Keep the mounted samples in the dark until imaging.Image with Zeiss LSM700 inverted confocal microscope with EC Plan-Neofluar 10×/0.30 or Plan-Apochromat 20×/0.80 air objectives (Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4722/bioprotoc-13-14-4722-g005.jpgFigure 5. Representative immunofluorescence images of gastruloids, EPI, and EPI+XAV aggregates at 168h stained for SOX1 (top) or SOX17 (bottom). Scale bars: 200 μm.Preparation of EPI aggregates for bulk RNA sequencing EPI aggregates were lysed with 200 µL TRIzol, followed by addition of 70 µL of chloroform to trigger phase separation. Then, the aqueous phase was collected.The extraction process was repeated a second time, and an equal volume of isopropanol was added to precipitate the RNA, which was collected by centrifugation at 20,000× g for 30 min.The pellet was washed with 15 mM sodium acetate in aqueous 70% ethanol, followed by salt-free 70% ethanol, before picking up in RNase-free water."
