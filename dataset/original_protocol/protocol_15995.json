  "procedures": [
    "This protocol describes an in vitro microneutralization assay to assess the inhibitory capacity of antibodies contained in polyclonal sera or purified monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The assay is performed in a 96-well plate format, allowing high-throughput sample processing. It uses live seasonal influenza viruses and viruses produced through reverse genetics that express the HA and NA of seasonal, avian, or pandemic strains in a safe and attenuated A/Puerto Rico/8/34 backbone. It involves addition of sera or mAbs both during the virus incubation period and after inoculum removal to mimic physiological conditions in which detectable antibodies in serum are continuously present.\nFirst, the virus needs to be titered using a 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay, which will take 2-5 days. This is important to determine optimal infection conditions. The microneutralization assay itself is outlined in Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.465#cpz1465-fig-0001]. Serum or mAb samples are serially diluted in 96-well plates. Virus is added to the serum/mAb samples and incubated for 1 hr to allow neutralization of the virus inoculum. The neutralized virus/serum/mAb mix is then added to MDCK cells. After a period of 1 hr, the infection procedure is stopped, additional serum/mAb is added to the cells, and the cells are grown for 48-72 hr to allow time for several rounds of the full viral life cycle in the presence of antibodies. Finally, the supernatant is used in a hemagglutination assay with red blood cells to determine the presence of virus and the degree of neutralization.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9a283b2c-d963-4769-b542-24b85e9b7769/cpz1465-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1",
    "Overview of microneutralization assay for influenza virus serology. Antibodies in polyclonal serum samples of different origin, or monoclonal antibodies (mAb) in distinct configurations including chimeric antibodies, Fab fragments, and others, can be assessed for their neutralization capacity against different strains and subtypes of influenza virus. After dilution of samples, the virus to be tested is added at 100 TCID50/50 µl and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature (RT). The serum/mAb–virus mix is transferred to confluent MDCK cells and incubated for 1 hr at 33° or 37°C, depending on the virus strain used. After inoculum removal, serum samples diluted in infection medium are added to the plates and incubated for 48-72 hr at 33° or 37°C. A hemagglutination assay is performed to detect the presence of virus in cell supernatants and to calculate neutralization titers. Reciprocal titers (1:x serum dilution) are displayed as absolute values.\nSerum samples are known to contain nonspecific virus inhibitors that may interfere with interpreting the activity of specific virus-neutralizing antibodies. Thus, these nonspecific inhibitors must first be inactivated. This is described in Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.465#cpz1465-prot-0004].",
    "Control samples may vary depending on the experimental setup and from laboratory to laboratory. A polyclonal serum or pool of several serum samples from individuals with high neutralization titers against influenza viruses is preferred. This pooled serum can be aliquoted and stored at −80°C for extended periods of time (>5 years) without significant decrease in titer. The initial dilution of this serum can vary depending on the titer, but a 1:100 initial dilution is typically used. Ideally, for each virus, three different control samples would be used covering a range of low, medium, and high neutralization. If these are not available, a control with medium to high reactivity should be used. If a neutralizing mAb is preferred, the initial concentration is set to 30 μg/ml. Ideally the control should display a high neutralization titer of >320.\nMaterials\nMadin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC, cat. no.

Record the cell passage number and date of the most recent split of MDCK cells in culture.\nIt is important to keep consistency between assay runs, as infectivity varies depending on cell passage number (typically p5-p40). When seeding cells, only combine flasks that contain cells of the same passage number and were propagated in parallel.\n2. Aspirate medium from confluent MDCK monolayers grown in T175 cell culture flasks.\nA confluent flask can be expected to yield enough cells for four to six 96-well plates. Each plate can accommodate up to twelve serum/mAb samples at the appropriate dilutions. One plate must be reserved for controls.\n3. Add 10 ml PBS to flasks and wash monolayers by rocking back and forth.\n4. Aspirate PBS and add 5 ml of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA to detach and disaggregate monolayers. Tilt flasks to ensure that all cells are covered and incubate at 37°C until cells detach (10-20 min).\nThe incubation time must not exceed 30 min.",
    "5. Tap flasks until all cells are in suspension, then add cDMEM to a total volume of 10 ml/flask and transfer cells to a 50-ml conical tube. If multiple flasks were used, pool cells at this step.\n6. To count cells, mix the cell suspension up and down with a serological pipette and transfer a small aliquot (∼300 µl) to a microcentrifuge tube, then take 20 µl from this tube to a fresh microcentrifuge tube and add 20 µl of 0.4% trypan blue. Pipette 10 µl to side A and side B of the same cell counting slide and count the number of live cells per ml in both sides using an automated cell counter.\n7. Calculate the mean number of live cells per ml by averaging the values from sides A and B.\n8. Dilute cells to ∼1.5–3 × 105 cells/ml in cDMEM. Make sure the cells are evenly distributed.\nEach plate requires 10 ml cells, including the plate for controls. It is best to prepare a slightly larger volume than needed (∼5 ml excess) to account for pipetting losses.\n9. Label the required number of clear, flat-bottom 96-well tissue culture plates with initials, date, and plate number.\n10. Transfer cell suspension to a sterile reservoir, then transfer 100 µl suspension (∼1.5–3 × 104 cells) to each well of the 96-well plates using a multichannel pipette.\n11. Rock gently and then incubate overnight in a 37°C incubator. Record time of incubation.\n12. Before proceeding with the assay, verify visually that cells have reached 80%-95% confluency and record the estimated confluency.\nDo not proceed if the cells are not 80%-95% confluent.\n13. Thaw the virus stock(s) and control samples at 4°C.\nPrepare infection medium",
    "14. Add 2 ml Normocin to a freshly opened 1-L bottle of UltraMDCK medium (0.2% v/v) and shake to mix.\n15. Thaw the number of aliquots of TPCK-treated trypsin needed to give 30 μl/plate.\n16. Prepare at least 30 ml infection medium per plate by adding 30 μl/plate TPCK-treated trypsin to 30 ml/plate UltraMDCK with Normocin. Mix well.\nInfection medium should be prepared on the day of use and kept at 4°C.\nDetermine TCID50\nThe TCID50 to titer the virus stock should be determined before starting the microneutralization assay and will take 2-5 days, depending on the virus.\n17. Dilute virus stock 1:10 by adding 100 μl to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube containing 900 μl infection medium. Mix and then transfer 100 μl to another tube containing 900 μl infection medium to make a 1:100 dilution.\nMake sure to change tips at every dilution step. Virus dilution steps are illustrated in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.465#cpz1465-fig-0002].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1b22185d-32b7-4a86-8d76-c9ea6697e2fa/cpz1465-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nConfiguration for dilution of virus stock to measure the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50).\n18. Transfer 250 μl of 1:100 virus to triplicate wells (A1-C1) of a 96-well U-bottom plate (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.465#cpz1465-fig-0002]).\n19. Add 200 μl infection medium to columns 2-12 of rows A-C.\n20. Serially dilute virus 5-fold for ten dilutions (up to column 11) by transferring 50 μl for each dilution (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.465#cpz1465-fig-0002]). Remove 50 μl from column 11.\nMake sure to change tips at every dilution step. The last column is left with infection medium only to serve as a no virus control.\n21. Take a plate of MDCK cells (step 12) and verify that they are at the right confluency (80%-95%).\nThe assay should not be started with subconfluent or overconfluent cells. If cells are subconfluent, the assay can be delayed until the desired confluency is reached.",
    "22. Aspirate medium and wash cells with 200 μl PBS. Add 60 μl infection medium to the top three rows.\nOnly the top three rows of cells are required to accommodate the virus dilutions.\n23. Transfer 60 μl of each virus dilution (including the no virus controls) to the corresponding wells in the plate of cells. Incubate 1 hr at 33° or 37°C, depending on the viral strain used, to allow virus absorption.\nPipette tips should be changed for transferring every virus dilution. Virus should be added carefully to the side of the wells to prevent damage to the cell monolayer.\nTypically, influenza B viruses are grown at 33°C and influenza A viruses at 37°C.\n24. Remove medium from all wells using a multichannel aspirator.\n25. Wash with 200 µl PBS and remove by aspiration.\n26. Add 100 μl infection medium to all wells and incubate 48 and 72 hr at 37°C.\nThe timepoint that yields a higher TCID50 is selected for the microneutralization assay.\n27. Analyze cells under a microscope for CPE.\nWells with less diluted virus should display CPE (characterized by a change in cell morphology, with cells becoming rounded and detaching from the plate) and wells with more diluted virus should display less or no CPE. Controls without virus are used as a reference for the lack of CPE.\n28. As a final readout, perform the HA assay as described in the last section of this protocol.\n29. Determine which wells in the dilution series are positive for virus. Calculate the TCID50/ml of the virus stock using the Reed & Muench.\nVarious calculation spreadsheets for this can be found online. Alternatively, a single formula can be used as described in Ramakrishnan (2016).\nPrepare plates of serially diluted serum/mAb samples",
    "Once the TCID50 has been determined, the neutralization assay can be performed. The required number of 96-well plates with MDCK cells must be prepared again according to steps 1-12 one day ahead of time. Once the plates are ready, the serum dilutions can be started. Serial dilutions can be performed in two different configurations (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.465#cpz1465-fig-0003]). Left-right dilutions (panel A) are preferred if high endpoint titers are expected because they allow more dilutions. Top-down dilutions (panel B) allow more samples to be run per plate, but should be used only if neutralization titers are not expected to exceed an 8-well dilution.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c60375ee-e183-49af-8bee-e09addbba92c/cpz1465-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nTwo configurations for serial dilutions of serum and mAb samples. Left-right dilutions (A) are best for samples with expected higher antibody titers. Top-down dilutions (B) are best for processing more samples with lower expected antibody titers. S1-S12 denote samples 1-12. Regardless of configuration, serum samples are diluted two-fold by transferring 120 μl to 120 μl infection medium, and mAb samples are diluted three-fold by transferring 80 μl to 160 μl infection medium. An equal volume (120 or 80 μl) is removed from the last column or row.\n30. Prepare the required number of empty 96-well plates needed for the serum/mAb samples to be serially diluted. Number plates and label as serum or mAb dilutions (or similar).\n31. On the lid, label each row (for left-right dilutions) or column (for top-down dilutions) with the sample ID or other information that correctly identifies the samples.\nIf multiple (e.g., longitudinal) samples from the same individual are being tested, all samples should be run on the same plate. If this is not possible, they should be run on consecutive plates.",
    "32. Using a multichannel pipette, add infection medium (see steps 14-16) to columns 2-12 (for left-right dilutions) or rows B-H (for top-down dilutions) on each dilution plate. Use 120 µl/well if testing serum samples or 160 µl/well if testing mAb samples.\n33. Add 240 µl inactivated serum (diluted 1:10) or mAb (30 µg/ml initial concentration) to the first column (for left-right dilutions) or first row (for top-down dilutions).\n34. Mix samples by pipetting with a multichannel pipette six to eight times, then make either a two-fold dilution of serum samples by transferring 120 µl to the second column (left-right dilutions) or second row (top-down dilutions) or a three-fold dilution of mAb samples by transferring 80 µl.\n35. Change tips, mix the second row/column by pipetting six to eight times, and repeat the transfer from the second row/column to the third.\n36. Continue until the last column/row is reached, then discard 120 μl (for serum samples) or 80 μl (for antibody samples) from the last column/row to make the volumes equal.\n37. Prepare an empty 96-well plate for controls and label as control dilutions (or similar).\n38. Add 120 µl infection medium to all wells except column 1.\n39. Add 240 µl infection medium to wells D1-H1 for no virus and virus only controls. Add 240 µl of control sample to wells A1-C1.\nWe typically assign only two wells for no virus controls, since no HA is expected and the phenotype is clear. This allows the controls to be kept to a single plate.\n40. Mix column 1 by pipetting six to eight times with a multichannel pipette and transfer 120 µl to the second column.",
    "41. Change tips, mix the second column by pipetting, and transfer to the next column. Continue to the last column and discard 120 µl from the last column. As above, change tips at every step.\nPrepare virus for assay\n42. Record the concentration of the virus stock in TCID50/50 μl along with all other information associated with stock (name, date, batch number, etc.).\n43. Calculate the required virus dilution factor (DF) according to the formula:\n         formula:\n\\begin{equation*} {\\rm{DF}} = {\\rm{virus \\; stock \\; concentration}} \\div {\\rm{desired \\; concentration}} \\end{equation*}\nThe desired final concentration is 100 × TCID50/50 µl. If the virus stock is 200,000 × TCID50/50 µl, the dilution factor is 2000.\n44. Calculate the total volume of virus needed (Vv) to give 7 ml per plate.\n45. Determine the dilution steps needed to reach the desired volume (Vv) at a concentration of 100 × TCID50/50 µl. Record the dilution steps in the following format (shown for a 200,000 × TCID50/50 µl stock and three plates requiring a Vv of 21 ml):\n         \n1:2 dilution (100 µl virus stock + 100 µl infection medium) → 100,000 TCID50/50 µl\n1:10 dilution (100 µl previous dilution + 900 µl infection medium) → 10,000 TCID50/50 µl\n1:10 dilution (300 µl previous dilution + 2.7 ml infection medium) → 1000 TCID50/50 µl\n1:10 dilution (2.1 ml previous dilution + 18.9 ml infection medium) → 100 TCID50/50 µl\nNo single dilution step should be higher than 1:10, and no pipetted virus volume should be smaller than 50 µl. All dilution steps should be documented. Pipette tips need to be changed at every step.\n46. Perform serial dilutions according to the documented steps. Use the smallest appropriate tube/flask for each dilution (e.g., microcentrifuge tube for volumes < 1.5 ml). Store diluted virus on ice until use.",
    "Mix virus with serum/mAb\n47. Prepare a new 96-well plate for each serum/mAb dilution plate (step 36) and control dilution plate (step 41). Label the new plates as virus/serum or virus/mAb (or similar) and include the number of the corresponding dilution plate.\nThese new plates will be used for incubating virus with serum/mAb. For this purpose, half the volume of diluted samples will be transferred to the new plates. The remainder will be used later to replace serum/mAb after removal of inoculum.\n48. Transfer 60 µl from each dilution plate to the corresponding new plate. Change tips after each transfer.\n49. Add 60 µl virus to each well of the virus/serum or virus/mAb plates.\n50. For the control plate, add 60 µl virus to rows A-F and 60 µl infection medium to rows G-H.\n51. Incubate virus/serum plates 1 hr (50-90 min) at room temperature (18°-25°C) on a rocking platform at 625 rpm.\n52. Keep the virus/serum/mAb plates on the shaker until use for infecting cells (step 56). Store the original dilution plates at 4°C until use for replacing serum/mAb (step 60).\nInfect cells\n53. Remove plates containing MDCK cells (step 12) from the incubator.\n54. Aspirate medium and add 200 µl PBS per well using a reservoir and a multichannel pipette.\nTo keep cells from drying out, aspirate medium from a maximum of two plates at a time.\n55. Label the top of each plate to correspond with serum/mAb and control dilution plates. Document which samples are run in each position for each plate.",
    "56. Remove virus/serum (or mAb) plates and the control plate from the shaker. Working row by row, aspirate PBS from the first cell plate and replace with 100 µl from the corresponding virus/serum plate. Change tips between transfers to avoid cross-contamination. When the last row is done, transfer the plate to the 33° or 37°C incubator.\nThe empty virus/serum plates can be discarded.\n57. Document the temperature and time when the first plate was incubated.\n58. Repeat infection for each plate, working one plate at a time and recording each time of infection.\nStop virus infection and replace serum\n59. When the first plate has incubated for 1 hr, stop infection by removing the supernatant from all wells and adding 200 μl PBS. Change tips between rows/columns to prevent cross-contamination. Document the time when infection was stopped.\n60. Transfer 50 µl serum or Ab from the corresponding dilution plates (step 52) to the correct rows. Change tips after each transfer to avoid cross-contamination.\nThe resulting serum/mAb dilution will be the same as during infection.\n61. Return plate to the incubator. Document the incubation time and temperature (33° or 37°C).\n62. Repeat steps 59-61 for all plates, handling one plate at a time at 1 hr after infection.\n63. Incubate plates for 48-72 hr, depending on the virus. Document the incubation time.\nThe optimal incubation time is determined initially when the TCID50 is calculated and is detected by visible CPE in infected cells, indicative of productive viral replication, which allows a robust hemagglutination (HA) assay to be performed as the final readout.\nPrepare RBCs for HA assay\n64. Document the species and date of the RBC bleed.",
    "The appropriate species of RBCs depends on the virus. Typically, chicken or turkey RBCs work well with most influenza virus strains. Contemporary seasonal influenza viruses may require the use of guinea pig RBCs.\n65. Calculate the required volume of diluted blood (Vdb) as 7 ml times the number of plates.\n66. If the stock concentration of RBCs is at least 13%, calculate the required volume of RBC stock (Vsb in ml) as:\n         formula:\n\\begin{equation*} {V_{{\\rm{sb}}}} = {V_{{\\rm{db}}}} \\times {\\rm{desired \\; concentration}} \\div {\\rm{stock \\; concentration}} = {V_{{\\rm{db}}}} \\times 0.5 \\div 13. \\end{equation*}\nBlood is diluted to 0.5% RBCs for the HA assay.\n67. To wash and pellet RBCs, agitate the blood container to ensure assure even distribution of RBCs, then transfer the calculated volume (Vsb) to a 50-ml conical tube containing 45 ml PBS and mix by inverting. Centrifuge 5 min at 300 × g, 4°C, and remove the supernatant.\nThe pellet is considered to contain 100% RBCs.\n68. Calculate the volume of PBS (VPBS) needed to dilute the RBCs as:\n         formula:\n\\begin{equation*} {V_{{\\rm{PBS}}}} = {V_{{\\rm{db}}}}-({V_{{\\rm{db}}}} \\times 0.005) \\end{equation*}\n69. Add VPBS to the pellet of RBCs and keep at 4°C until use (discard after the day of preparation).\nPerform HA assay\n70. Add 50 µl neat supernatant (step 63) to the corresponding wells of a 96-well conical bottom plate in a mirror fashion.\n71. Resuspend the 0.5% RBCs by inverting the tube several times and pour into a sterile reservoir. Pipette 50 µl to each well, being careful not to touch the wells.\n72. Incubate 30-60 min on ice or in a 2°-8°C refrigerator to develop.\n73. Read the HA assay and scan the plate for documentation.",
    "Complete hemagglutination is considered to have occurred when the RBCs are still in suspension after the no virus controls have settled completely, which is seen as a visible pellet in the bottom of the plate (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.465#cpz1465-fig-0004]) that slides down if the plate is tilted at a 45° angle. When a portion of the RBCs is partially agglutinated (or partially settled), the absence of hemagglutination can be confirmed by tilting the plates at a 45° angle for 20-30 s. If the settled RBC pellet slides down, that particular well is considered negative for agglutination (see last step of Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.465#cpz1465-fig-0001] and Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.465#cpz1465-fig-0004]).\nThe last agglutination-negative well for each sample is considered the endpoint dilution and is calculated assuming a 1:10 starting concentration in the first well (e.g., four agglutination-negative wells would result in an endpoint titer of 1:80).

    "Here, we describe the procedure for preparing and aliquoting a working solution of commercially available TPCK-treated trypsin. Treatment of trypsin protease with TPCK (L-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone) inhibits chymotrypsin without affecting trypsin activity, providing higher cleavage specificity. Trypsin added to infection medium is able to catalytically cleave influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA0 into HA1/HA2), rendering the virus infectious. Influenza virus hemagglutinin activation is necessary for multicycle growth of the virus in cell culture. It should be noted that TPCK-treated trypsin is inhibited by the presence of FBS in cell culture medium.\nMaterials\nTPCK-treated trypsin, lyophilized (Sigma, cat. no. T8802-100MG)\nDNase/RNase-free distilled water (Invitrogen, cat. no. 10977-015)\n1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf, cat. no. 022363204)\n15-ml polypropylene sterile conical tube (Thermo Scientific, cat. no. 339650)\n1000-µl barrier pipette tips (Thermo Scientific, cat. no. 2079PK)\nNOTE: To maintain sterility, all steps should be performed in a class II biological safety cabinet (Thermo Scientific, cat. no. 1323TS).\nPrepare 10,000× stock (10 mg/ml)\n1.

    "This protocol can be implemented to inactivate nonspecific virus inhibitors in human or animal serum samples using receptor-destroying enzyme II (RDE II). The commercial enzyme used here is a filter-sterilized, lyophilized culture supernatant of Vibrio cholerae Ogawa type 558.\nSerum samples should be collected according to the specific laboratory's standard protocols. They are not highly sensitive to temperature changes, but should be stored at 4°C for short periods of time (up to 4 weeks) and at −20° or −80°C for extended periods of time (up to 5-10 years or even longer at −80°C).
