    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCulture of astrocytes\nTiming: 7–10 days\nThis protocol describes how to obtain a pure culture of neonatal astrocytes from brains from mouse pups 1–3 days old. Older mice could be use but the yield of the process is reduced significantly. We recommend using 6–8 brain cortices per T75 flask to be cultured. Numbers and surface area can be adjusted if the researcher choses to use whole brains or older mice.\nNote: Culture of astrocytes from adult mouse brain has been reviewed elsewhere (Sun et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). Please refer to this same publication for micrographs of postnatal astrocyte cultures similar to the ones described here.\nAlternatives: Whole brains instead of cortices could be used. However, Astrocytes from different brain regions are heterogeneous, which may lead to increased variability in the results across experiments.\nNote: Always work under sterile conditions.\nPrepare sterile dissection tools and place them into 70% Ethanol.\nPrepare one 50 mL tube with 10–15 mL of 4°C HBSS per Flask to be cultured, place them on ice.\nPrepare 10 cm petri dishes with 5–8 mL of 4°C HBSS and place them on ice.\nAnesthetize pups.\nEuthanize each pup by decapitation. Gently extract the brain by performing two lateral incisions at the back of the head. Avoid touching the brains and gently drop them facing up into the petri dishes.\nNote: Always follow your institution’s IACUC guidelines for anesthesia and euthanasia procedures\nUsing magnification system if needed, gently separate the cortices from the rest of the brain. Add cortices to the 50 mL tubes with HBSS previously prepared\nRepeat steps 5 and 6 until done with all the pups\nOnce Cortices have been pooled in the 50 mL tubes (5–8/tube) spin them down 400 or 300 × g (RCF) for 5 min at 4°C",
    "Remove the supernatant carefully to avoid moving the cortices.\nAdd 5 mL of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA, pipette up and down at least 6 times with a 5 or 10 mL pipet to gently disaggregate the tissue.\nIncubate for 15 min at 37°C in a cell culture incubator.\nAdd 10 mL of Complete DMEM/F12 to stop the reaction. Invert the tube\nPlace a 70 micron cell strainer on top of a new 50 mL tube and filter the suspension by gravity flow. Help the flow through with a syringe plunger if necessary.\nCentrifuge the flow-through at 400 × g for 5 min\nRemove supernatant\nResuspend pellet in 12–15 mL of Complete DMEM/F12.\nAdd to the precoated T75 flask\nIncubate at 37°C 5% CO2 and 85%–95% humidity.\nChange media the next day or the latest 48 h later\nReplace media every 2–3 days\nAstrocytes will be confluent and rid of debris by day 7–10.\nNote: Media can be replaced every 2–3 days for around a month and the cells will still be fine. Old cultures will just have more microglia growing on them (see next steps).\nAlternatives: Instead of using Complete DMEM, one can use N1-DMEM to avoid presence of FBS which could impact astrocyte biology. Astrocytes typically grow twice as slow in N1-DMEM and we recommend starting with more cell density (Like 10–12 cortices per T75 flask). Expect to have a confluent culture after about 2 or 3 weeks of culture. Change media as described above.\nSeeding of astrocytes\nTiming: 3 h hands on, 24–48 h total\nOnce cells are confluent and uniform, healthy and without major debris, they can be seeded in multi well plates for downstream analyses. Please refer to Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] for cell numbers to be used in each type of multi well plate.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1292_5.csv",
    "Continue to step 34 for astrocyte silencing or directly to step 40 for astrocyte stimulation.\nShake T75 flask for 30 min 180–200 rpm at 37°C\nNote: If the shaker doesn’t have CO2 influx, it is convenient to seal the lid of flasks so they can keep the CO2 levels inside.\nRemove media and add 10 mL of fresh medium\nShake for 1.5–2 h more at 200 rpm at 37°C. Check under the microscope for the detachment of microglia.\nRemove media\nRinse astrocytes once with HBSS\nAdd 4 mL of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA and shake them at 37°C checking them every 2 min until monolayer has detached.\nAdd 10 mL of complete DMEM/F12 to stop the reaction\nPipet thoughtfully and transfer to a 50 mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min\nResuspend the pellet in 10 mL of Complete DMEM/F12 and count the cells\nSeed the cells according to numbers of Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]\nIncubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 and 85%–95% humidity for 24 or 48 h until the cells look flat again.\nNote: For problems with cell attachment refer to troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nNote: For problems with culture contamination refer to troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nNote: Media from steps 23 and 25 will contain microglia; if you want to use them for downstream analyses, we recommend you purify them using positive selection for CD11b+ cells or any other marker of your choice. You could do that by FACS or magnetic beads-based separation.\nSilencing of astrocytes\nTiming: 30 min hands on, total from 8 h to 3 days.\nIn this section we describe how to silence primary murine astrocytes with siRNAs.",
    "Note: Always use the microscope to confirm that cells are healthy and attached before starting the protocol. User should determine the best siRNA sequence for their target molecule of interest. As a general guidance, we used DHARMACON smart pools.\nMix INTERFERin reagent with the desired siRNAs in Opti-MEM following Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1292_6.csv\nIncubate the mix 10 min at room temperature.\nChange the media of the astrocytes to fresh new media (Complete DMEM or N1-DMEM) following volumes on Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3].\nAdd the mix of INTERFERin, siRNAs and Opti-MEM dropwise to the astrocyte’s wells and incubate at 37°C.\nIf viability of astrocytes is critically reduced, go to troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nAfter 48 h incubation, downstream analysis can be performed (see following sections)\nKnockdown efficiency can be confirmed by qPCR or western blot, it should be detected from 24 to 96 h after transfection.\nNote: If target molecule expression is not reduced, go to troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nNote: In our experience, astrocytes are quite hard to transfect or transduce. Researchers could explore the possibility of transducing with lentiviruses or electroporating or nucleofecting the astrocytes if the above transfection with siRNAs does not end in the expected results.\nProceed to the following section or oxygen consumption analysis section as desired.\nCytokine stimulation and Astrocyte Conditioned Media collection\nTiming: 30 min hands on, total from 8 h to 3 days.\nIn this section we describe how to stimulate primary murine astrocytes with cytokines in vitro and how to proceed with gene expression analysis and/or Astrocyte Conditioned Media (ACM) collection.\nResearchers can choose to do the following steps after seeding the astrocytes (step 33) or after silencing (step 39).",
    "When cells are ready, change the media to fresh media (Complete DMEM or N1-DMEM) with the desired final concentration of the required cytokines. See Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4] as a guidance for concentrations (Chao et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Rothhammer et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Sanmarco et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6])\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1292_7.csv\nNote: This is general guidance, but researchers must set up the optimal condition for specific cytokines and combinations. Proceed to step 41 or 43\nNote: On use of small molecules or chemical inhibitors: If the researcher needs to treat astrocytes with some sort of drug, we recommend doing that 30 min prior the cytokine stimulation (Chao et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Clark et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) and keep the drug in the media after cytokine addition if the drug effects are reversible or if the incubation time is going to be long.\nIncubate at 37°C for 6–48 h for gene expression analysis.\nWash the cells gently once with HBSS, aspirate HBSS and lysate the cells with Buffer RLT (Qiagen), store at −20 or −80°C for later RNA extraction (Qiagen RNeasy kit) or proceed directly with RNA extraction and desired gene expression analysis (RT-qPCR…).\nFor ACM collection, incubate the cells at 37°C with media with cytokines for 8 h to ON.\nWash the cells gently at least twice with HBSS to get rid of any trace of cytokines.\nReplace with fresh media without cytokines and incubate at 37°C for 2 days.\nCollect the ACM to be used from downstream studies like Neurotoxicity assay or measurement of cytokine production by ELISA.\nNote: ACM media can be aliquoted and frozen at −80°C, however for certain downstream procedures it is better to use it fresh.\nOxygen consumption analysis\nTiming: 3 h and 1 more hour on a following day hands on. Total 24–48 h",
    "In this part of the protocol, we describe oxygen consumption analysis performed on primary murine astrocytes with a XFe96 Seahorse analyzer (Agilent Technologies).\nCritical: Change astrocyte media to Low Glucose-DMEM\nIncubate at 37°C for 24 or 48 h (this a starvation step)\nStimulate the astrocytes, if needed, following steps 40 and 41.\nCritical: Make sure you still use Low Glucose DMEM\nThe day before performing the assay make sure you hydrate the sensor cartridge in Seahorse XF Calibrant.\nStart Mito Stress assay with Seahorse XF Cell Mito Stress Test Kit (#103015-100, Agilent Technologies). Strictly follow the manufacturers’ manual (Mito_Stress_Test_Kit_Guide). With this system, oxygen consumption rate (OCR) is quantified real-time after sequential addition of 2 mM Oligomycin, 1 mM FCCP and 5 mM Rotenone/Antimycin A.\nNote: Preparation and performance of Seahorse analysis is very well explained in the Seahorse XF Cell Mito Stress Test Kit User Guide. Please refer to it and strictly follow the protocol.\nOnce Seahorse run is done carefully remove the plate from the machine\nAspirate media, wash cells once with HBSS and make sure under the microscope that the cells are still attached to the wells and looking healthy.\nNote: If cells are no longer attached or look severely distressed, refer to troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nAspirate all the liquid and freeze the plate immediately at −80°C for at least over night before proceeding. Plates can be store for up to 4 weeks.\nThaw the cell plates at room temperature.\nQuantify the cells using CyQUANT cell proliferation assay kit (#C7026, Invitrogen) following the protocol for Cell Number Determination (CyQUANT_manual). We recommend using a cell number standard curve with previously frozen aliquots of known astrocyte numbers. This is an easy and reliable method.\nCritical: Normalize OCR rate to cell number. This is crucial step to get reliable and reproducible results.",
    "Critical: A confluent and healthy monolayer is crucial for the good performance of the Seahorse OCR assay. We do not recommend performing the assay with patchy monolayers or unhealthy cells.\nAlternatives: Likewise, we describe here for the XF Cell Mito Stress Test, other Agilent seahorse tests can be run following the same pre- and post-Seahorse analysis steps described here.\nAlternatives: Normalization can be performed with other techniques like direct number of cells quantification by DAPI staining and imaging. However, normalization to protein amount (with BCA or Bradford assays for example) is extremely discouraged as the poly-L-lysine in the plate would interfere with measurements."
