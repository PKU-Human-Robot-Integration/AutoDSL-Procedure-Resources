    "1. Chip design and micromachining parameters\nDesign the microfluidic chip layers with FreeCAD open-source design software; refer to Table 1 for the dimensions of the channels. Include four 2.54 mm diameter holes in the design to use a custom-made aligner for a correct layer superposition.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\n,Length (μm),Width (μm)\nLower chamber,28400,800\nUpper chamber,31000,800\nTable 1: Dimensions of the upper and lower channels of the device.\nCut 95 µm-thick, adhesive, transparent vinyl sheets into 30 cm x 30 cm squares to fit in the plotter properly.\nUse Brother CanvasWorkspace software to create a 30 cm x 30 cm workspace, and fill it with the designed patterns for the different layers of the chip (Figure 1A). Store it in a .svg file.\nCut the 30 cm x 30 cm vinyl sheets with the edge plotter (Figure 1B-D).\n\t\nStick the vinyl sheet to a low tack adhesive mat, and eliminate all the air bubbles if necessary.\nUpload the .svg file to the plotter, and set the cutting parameters: cutting blade: level 3; cutting pressure: level 0; cutting speed: level 1. Place the adhesive mat with the vinyl into the plotter, and start the cutting process.\nCut the top channel pattern on 12 µm-thick double-sided tape vinyl by following the previous steps.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62353/62353fig1v2.jpg\nFigure 1: Chip design and micromachining process.

    "Mix the PDMS and curing agent in a ratio of 10:1 (v/v), and place the mixture under vacuum for 15 min to remove air bubbles. Pour 55 mL of the mixture into a 55 cm2 square culture dish to obtain a 2 mm-thick layer. Remove bubbles with a needle.\nCure the mixture (step 2.1) in an oven for 1 h at 80 °C. Unmold the PDMS and cut it into rectangles with the chip dimensions. Make holes for the tubing with an 18 G syringe needle.\n3. Chip assembly\nNOTE: For better understanding, see Figure 2.\nAssemble the whole device using an aligner to adjust channels, inlets, and outlets properly. Pile up four vinyl layers (with the corresponding bottom micropattern) for assembling the lower channel, keeping the cover tape of the bottom layer to avoid sticking to the aligner.\nCut and place the polycarbonate (PC) porous membrane on top of the lower channel to separate it from the upper one. Be careful not to cover the inlets of the lower channel.\nAdd ten vinyl layers with the upper chamber design. Stick a double-sided tape vinyl layer with the top-channel pattern on top. Remove the chip from the aligner and stick it on the glass slide.\nPlace a 2-mm-thick PDMS sheet on top of the double-sided tape vinyl layer to provide appropriate anchoring for the tubing and to avoid leakage. Leave a weight on top of the chip overnight to ensure the chip is completely watertight. Sterilize the chip by flushing 70% v/v ethanol for 5 min, and then wash with distilled H2O.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62353/62353fig02.jpg",

Human primary fibroblasts come from healthy donors and were obtained from the collection of biological samples of human origin registered in \"Registro Nacional de Biobancos para Investigación Biomédica del Instituto de Salud Carlos III\".\nWork in a cell culture hood, previously sterilized under ultraviolet light and wiped with ethanol.",

GFP-hFBs are human primary fibroblasts transformed with the vector pLZRS-IRES-EGFP to express cytoplasmic green fluorescence. These cells were modified following previously published protocols30,31\nCulture both hKCs and hFBs in 1x DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% of antibiotic/antimycotic solution.

Cell viability assay\nNOTE: Live/Dead kit stains cells with green or red fluorescence depending on their live or dead state. For proper viability differentiation, non-fluorescent hKCs and hFBs must be used in this step. All the steps in the procedure are carried out through UCi2 with pump 2.\nWash the top channel with 1x PBS for 5 min at 50 µL/min to remove culture medium.",
