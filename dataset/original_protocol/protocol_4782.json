    "Remove 3 adult mouse hearts from freshly euthanized mice and place them on a Petri dish containing ice cold PBS.Place the hearts under a sterile cell culture hood and perform the following steps under sterile conditions.Pump the blood out of the hearts by the use of forceps.Mince the 3 hearts on a Petri dish on ice. By the use of scissors cut the heart into 10 pieces and by the use of a scalpel reduce them into a size of 1 mm.Transfer the minced tissue (using the scalpel as a spatula) in an autoclaved glass beaker with a magnetic stirrer and cover the beaker with aluminum foil. Add 25 ml digestion buffer and digest tissue under constant stirring at 37 °C for 5 min. Note: The stirring speed should be adjusted so that all the pieces of tissue just flow and do not sit at the bottom but should not be too strong to destroy the cells.Leave the mixture for 1 min for the tissue to sit down and discard the first supernatant that contains debris and blood cells.Add 25 ml digestion buffer and digest tissue under constant stirring at 37 °C for 10 min.Leave the mixture 1 min for the tissue to sit down and collect the supernatant with a 25 ml pipette (around 22 ml). Do not collect the tissue pieces that tend to float.Place the supernatants in plastic 50 ml falcon tubes on ice containing 2 ml fibroblast medium. If possible supernatants can be combined in one falcon but for each supernatant 2 ml of fibroblast medium is required.Repeat steps 6-10 until all the tissue is dissolved (typically 7-10 times). Spin the cells down for 5 min at 300 x g at 4 °C.Resuspend cells in 20 ml fibroblast medium.",
    "Plate the cell suspension into two 100 mm cell culture dishes (10 ml cell suspension/dish) and incubate them at 37 °C in a cell culture incubator with 5% CO2 for 2 h (“Pre-plating”). 2 h upon plating alive and healthy fibroblasts should have adhered to the dish. Check the cell confluence under the microscope (it should be around 50%). At this point fibroblasts resemble little round dots.Collect and discard supernatant. Wash 3x with 2.5 ml warm PBS and replenish with 10 ml fresh fibroblast medium. Cultivate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a cell culture incubator.Primary adult mouse fibroblasts divide less than embryonic ones and under our culture conditions have a doubling time of 36-48 h. Typically, 2-3 days upon plating the fibroblasts reach 90% confluence. Note: Caution! Do not split the fibroblasts until they reached a minimum confluence of 80% because the fibroblasts growth rate will decrease and they will differentiate.Once confluence is reached fibroblasts are trypsinized as follows. Wash two times with 2 ml pre-warmed PBS and then add 2 ml warm trypsin. Incubate for 5 min at 37 °C, in a cell culture incubator. Control if fibroblasts detached from plate. If not prolong incubation until the cells detach. Neutralize trypsin by adding 7 ml pre-warmed fibroblast medium. To achieve a re-plating confluence of 30%, split 1:3 into 3 new 100 mm plates. Add 3 ml of fibroblast suspension in a plate containing 7 ml fresh and warm fibroblast medium (final volume/plate 10 ml)"
