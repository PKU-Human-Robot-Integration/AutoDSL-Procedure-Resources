    "All animal procedures in this study were approved by either the Washington University in St. Louis Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol 20160187) or University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol 14103918). Human fetal small intestine at less than 24-week gestation was obtained in accordance with the University of Pittsburgh anatomical tissue procurement guidelines after Institutional Review Board approval (protocol PRO14100537) from the University of Pittsburgh Health Sciences Tissue Bank through an honest broker system. De-identified human breast milk or pasteurized donor breast milk was obtained with a waiver of consent from the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board.\n1. Crypt Isolation and Establishment of Enteroids from Neonatal Mice or Premature Human Small Intestine\nMedia preparation\n\tNOTE: Media should be prepared in the hood the day before crypt isolation.\n\t\nPrepare 1.11 L Culture Media. Begin with 1 L Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 4.5 g/L glucose and L-glutamine and add 110 mL Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (final concentration 10%), 11 mL Penicillin-Streptomycin (final concentration 1%), and 1.1 mL sterile insulin (final concentration 0.1%).\nPrepare 500 mL PBS-Antibiotic Mixture. Begin with 500 mL 1x Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) with 10% FBS and add 5 mL Gentamicin (final concentration 1%), 1 mL Amphotericin B (final concentration 0.2%), and 5 mL Penicillin-Streptomycin (final concentration 1%).\nPrepare 30 mL Cell Disruption Media #1. First prepare 30 mL Culture Media. Add 600 µL 0.5 M Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (final concentration 10 mM), 300 µL Gentamicin (final concentration 1%), and 60 µL Amphotericin B (final concentration 0.2%).\nPrepare 30 mL Cell Disruption Media #2. First prepare 30 mL Culture Media. Add 300 µL 0.5 M EDTA (final concentration 5 mM), 300 µL Gentamicin (final concentration 1%), and 60 µL Amphotericin B (final concentration 0.2%).",
    "Prepare 50 mL Crypt Culture Media Without Growth Factors. Measure 33.4 mL 1x Advanced DMEM/F-12 and add 10 mL FBS (final concentration 20%).\n\t\t\nAdd 500 µL Penicillin-Streptomycin (final concentration 1%), 500 µL L-glutamine (final concentration 1%), 500 µL Gentamicin (final concentration 1%), 100 µL Amphotericin B (final concentration 0.2%), 2.5 µL 1 M N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N-2-ethane sulfonic acid (HEPES) (final concentration 0.05 mM), 500 µL 100 mM N-Acetylcysteine (final concentration 1 mM), 500 µL 100x N-2 supplement, 1 mL 50x serum-free supplement (e.g., B-27) minus Vitamin A, and 500 µL 1 mM 100x Y-27632.\nPrepare 1 mL Crypt Culture Media With Growth Factors. First prepare 1 mL of Crypt Culture Media Without Growth Factors. Add 2.5 µL 40 µg/mL Wnt3a (final concentration 100 ng/mL), 1 µL 100 µg/mL Noggin (final concentration 100 ng/mL), 2 µL 250 µg/mL R-Spondin (final concentration 500 ng/mL), and 0.5 µL 100 µg/mL EGF (final concentration 50 ng/mL).\nCrypt isolation\nPlace solubilized basement membrane extract (see Table of Materials) on ice to thaw before beginning.\n\t\tNOTE: Keep basement membrane on ice or it will polymerize.\nIn compliance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol for mice greater than 14 days of age, euthanize mice with two methods of euthanasia with the second being a physical procedure to ensure death.\n\t\tNOTE: For mice under 14 days of age, decapitation is the standard procedure using scissors.\nUsing scissors and forceps, make a vertical incision down the midline of the abdomen, through the skin and peritoneum, for the entire length of the abdomen. Excise the small intestine from the stomach to the cecum with scissors and remove the mesentery with forceps.",
    "NOTE: Two-week-old male and female C57BL/6J mouse pups, each weighing 5.5 - 7 g, were used for crypt isolation. Any age or size mouse can be used for crypt isolation.\nTo prepare freshly harvested small intestine for crypt isolation, position intestine straight, and cut the intestine longitudinally along its entire length using scissors.\n\t\tNOTE: Mouse and human intestine can be prepared similarly.\nClean stool out of intestine by gently shaking the intestine back and forth in a PBS-Antibiotic Mixture-filled Petri dish using forceps.\nAdd 30 mL of Cell Disruption Media #1 to a 50 mL conical tube. Cut the intestine into 0.5 cm length pieces directly into the tube. Set the tube in an ice bucket and gently agitate on shaker at lowest speed for 15 min.\nWhile the tissues are on the shaker, obtain 24- or 48-well plates to grow crypts if the enteroids are to be used for RNA, DNA, or protein isolation. Use 8-well chamber slides to grow crypts if the enteroids are to be used for whole mount confocal imaging.\nIn the hood, add 15 µL of basement membrane to the bottom of each well of the 24- or 48-well plate. If using chamber slides, add 9 µL of basement membrane to the bottom of each chamber.\n\t\tNOTE: Adjust volume of basement membrane according to the size of plate if needed.\nQuickly spread the basement membrane with the pipette tip so that the basement membrane forms a thin layer on the bottom of the well. Place the plate at 37 °C in incubator for 30 min to allow the basement membrane to polymerize.\n\t\tNOTE: The crypts will not attach if basement membrane is not a thin layer or if basement membrane contains air bubbles.",
    "After 15 min on a shaker, filter the tissue through a 100 µm strainer. Discard the flow through.\nAdd 30 mL Cell Disruption Media #2 to a new 50 mL conical tube. Remove tissue from strainer and add to the tube.\nSet the tube in an ice bucket and gently agitate on shaker at lowest speed for 15 min.\nAfter 15 min on the shaker, filter tissue through a 100 µm strainer. Keep flow through at this step, in case yield is low in later steps.\n\t\tNOTE: All flow through tubes must be kept on ice.\nAdd 15 mL DMEM with 4.5 g/L glucose and L-glutamine to a new 50 mL conical tube. Remove tissue from strainer and add to the tube. Vigorously shake the tube by hand for 10 s. Filter through a 100 µm strainer and collect flow through. Repeat until flow through contains no particulates.\nIn the hood, filter the flow through from previous step into a new 50 mL conical tube using 70 µm strainers for mouse tissue or 100 µm strainers for human tissue.\n\t\tNOTE: Have extra strainers on standby, and pour slowly as strainers will clog with debris.\nCentrifuge the tube at 200 x g for 8 min at 4 °C and place directly in an ice bucket in the hood. Remove the supernatant by pipette without disturbing the pellet. Resuspend pellet with total desired amount of Crypt Culture Media Without Growth Factors.\n\t\tNOTE: The enriched crypts are the 'sandy' layer of the pellet. Each well requires 250 µL of Crypt Culture Media Without Growth Factors.\nEstablishment of enteroids\nPlate the crypt media mixture directly on the basement membrane.\nCheck crypts with a microscope to ensure isolation process was successful.",
    "NOTE: Cells and balls of cells are desired. Approximately 100 individual crypts are plated per well.\nIncubate the plate at 37 °C for 3 h to allow crypts to adhere to the basement membrane.\n\t\tNOTE: This incubation is with Crypt Culture Media Without Growth Factors.\nSlowly remove the media and excess crypts that failed to attach using a P-200 pipette.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not disturb the basement membrane as the attached crypts can become dislodged.\nSlowly add 250 µL of Crypt Culture Media With Growth Factors to each well.\n\t\tNOTE: For 24-, 48-well plates, or chamber slides, 250 µL of Crypt Culture Media With Growth Factors is sufficient.\nReplace the media every 2 days with fresh Crypt Culture Media With Growth Factors for 5 days prior to treatments to allow for optimal attachment and growth.\n2. Mouse Breast Milk Collection\nSeparate a C57BL/6J lactating dam at postpartum 7 - 12 days from its pups for 6 h prior to milking.\nAnesthetize the lactating dam with isoflurane via a nose cone and administer a subcutaneous injection of oxytocin at 0.15 IU/kg body weight. Wait 3 min before attempting milking procedure.\nClean teats with 70% ethanol prior to milking procedure and let dry.\nExtract milk from teats one at a time using an electric human breast pump with silicone tubing sized to fit mouse teats into a 5 mL collection tube.\n\tNOTE: Optimal breast pumps have two settings, one for speed and one for suction. It is best to start with the lowest settings of each and increase both slowly until milk is extracted. Ideally, total yield will be ~ 500 µL - 1 mL of mouse breast milk per lactating dam.\nImmediately aliquot breast milk and store at -80 °C.\n\tNOTE: Avoid freeze/thaw cycles.",
    "Treat enteroids on day 5 with 50 µL/mL of mouse breast milk per mL of Crypt Culture Media with Growth Factors for 24 h at 37 °C.\n3. Whole Mount Staining of Enteroids\nPreparation of reagents\nPrepare 16 mL 1x PBS per 8 wells.\nPrepare 2 mL 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 1x PBS per 8 wells.\nPrepare 2 mL 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1x PBS per 8 wells.\nPrepare 24 mL PBS Tween (PBST is 0.1% Tween 20 in 1x PBS) per 8 wells.\nPrepare 2 mL 10% normal donkey serum (NDS) in 0.1% PBST (10% NDS/PBST) per 8 wells.\nPrepare 4 mL 1% NDS in 0.1% PBST (1% NDS/PBST) per 8 wells.\nStaining Day 1\nAspirate off treatments and wash enteroids with PBS. Add 250 µL 4% PFA per well. Place on rotator for 1 - 2 h at 4 °C. Remove 4% PFA with pipette.\nWash 4 times with 250 µL/well 1x PBS. Place on rotator for 10 min at room temperature (RT).\n\t\tNOTE: It is possible to store plate for 1 - 2 days at 4 °C if needed.\nAdd 250 µL/well 0.1% Triton X-100. Incubate for 1 h at RT. Remove 0.1% Triton X-100 with pipette.\nWash 4 times with 250 µL/well 1x PBS. Place on rotator for 15 min at RT.\nAdd 250 µL/well 10% NDS/PBST. Incubate for 45 min at RT. Remove 10% NDS/PBST with pipette.\nAdd 250 µL/well primary antibody, diluted 1/250 in 1% NDS/PBST, and incubate overnight at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The optimal antibody dilution varies according to the manufacturer.\nStaining Day 2\nWash at least 5 times for 4 - 5 h with 250 µL/well PBST. Place on rotator at 4 °C between each wash.",
    "Add 250 µL/well secondary antibody, diluted 1/1,000 in 1% NDS/PBST. Wrap the plate in foil and incubate overnight at 4 °C.\nStaining Day 3\nAdd 250 µL/well nuclear stain 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 15 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Keep the plate in the dark.\nWash 6 times with 250 µL/well PBST.
