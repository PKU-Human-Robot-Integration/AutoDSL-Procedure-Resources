    "1. Derivation of Mouse Embryonic CPCs from Mouse ESCs\nPrepare mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) feeder layer.\n\t\nWarm MEF medium (10% FBS in DMEM) to 37 °C.\nPrepare gelatin coated plates.\n\t\t\nAdd 1 ml of 0.1% Gelatin in water into a well of 6-well plate or 5 ml into a 10 cm dish.\nLeave plates or dishes at 37 °C or room temperature for at least 30 min. Aspire the gelatin prior to use.\nThaw irradiated MEFs quickly in a 37 °C water bath, with gentle shaking.\nTransfer the cells gently to a 15 ml or 50 ml conical tube. Add 5 ml of pre-warmed MEF medium. Swirl the cells slowly and centrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min.\nResuspend cells in MEF medium and count viable cells. Use the following volumes of MEF medium: 2 ml for cells per well from a 6-well plate and 10 ml for cells from a 10 cm dish.\nPlate cells into 6-well plates or 10 cm dishes at 1-2 x 106 per plate/dish.\nIncubate the MEF plates/dishes at 37 °C, 5% CO2 at least 24 hr prior to use.\n\t\tNOTE: Discard MEF plates/dishes older than a week.\nPrepare mouse ESCs\n\t\nCulture the Isl1-cre; Rosa26YFP/ Mef2c-cre; Rosa26YFP mouse ESCs on MEFs till 90% confluent. Use ES cell medium comprised of 410 ml DMEM, 75 ml FBS, 0.1 mM MEM NEAA, 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM Pyruvate, 100 U Pen/Strep, and 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol.\nPrepare gelatin coated 6-well plates as described in 1.1.2.\nAspirate medium from plates and rinse cells with DPBS.\n\t\t\nAspirate DPBS and add 0.4 ml 0.25% Trypsin into one well of 6-well plate. Incubate cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 5 min. Add 1 ml pre-warmed ES medium to cease Trypsin reaction.",
    "Harvest cells and centrifuge cells at 200 x g and aspirate medium. Resuspend cells in 1 ml ES cell medium and count the cells.\nPlate ESCs on gelatin-coated plates at density of 3 x 104/cm2. Incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for about 2 days when ESCs reach about 90% confluent. Change the medium everyday.\nWhen ESCs are 90% confluent, repeat Steps 1.2.2-1.2.5 to completely remove the MEF feeders.\nInduce CPC differentiation by EB formation\n\t\nPrepare differentiation medium as followed: 36 ml IMDM, 12 ml Ham’s F12, 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.34 ml BSA (7.5%), 0.25 ml N2, 0.5 ml B27, 50 µg/ml AA, and 0.45 mM 1-thioglycerol.\nAspirate medium from cells and rinse with DPBS. Aspirate DPBS and add 0.4 ml 0.25% Trypsin into one well of 6-well plate. Incubate at 37 °C for 5 min.\nAdd 1 ml differentiation medium to cease the reaction and pipette up and down to disperse cell clusters into single cells.\nCentrifuge ESCs at 200 x g for 5 min and discard the medium.\n\t\t\nResuspend 1 x 106 ESCs in 1 ml differentiation medium. Count the cells, and culture the cells in low detachment Petri dish at concentration of 1 x 105 cells/ml in differentiation medium at 37 °C for first EB aggregation.\nTwo days after EB formation, transfer EBs from dishes to 50 ml tubes. Spin at 200 x g for 1 min. Remove medium and rinse EBs with 10 ml DPBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+.\nAspirate DPBS and add 1 ml 0.25% Trypsin. Incubate at 37 °C for 5 min. Add 4.5 ml differentiation medium to stop the reaction. Pipet up and down to dissociate EBs into single cells.\nCentrifuge the cells at 200 x g for 5 min. Aspirate medium and resuspend cells in 1 ml differentiation medium.",
    "Count the cells, and dilute 2 x 106 cells to 1 x 105 cells/ml in differentiation medium. Add VEGF, Bmp4 and Activin A to the medium at final concentration of 5 ng/ml, 0.8 ng/ml, and 5 ng/ml, respectively. Culture the cells in Petri dish for second EB formation at 37 °C.\n40 hr after second EB formation, transfer EBs to 50 ml tubes. Rinse with DPBS once, dissociate EBs with 1 ml 0.25% Trypsin at 37 °C for 5 min. Pipet up and down to dissociate EBs into single cells.\nResuspend the cells in Stempro-34 medium with 5 ng/ml VEGF, 10 ng/ml bFGF and 12.5 ng/ml FGF10. Plate the cells at 2 x 105/cm2 in gelatin-coated plates. Culture in 37 °C incubator for about 32 hr before CPC isolation.\nIsolate mCPCs\n\t\nAspirate medium and rinse with DPBS. Add 0.5 ml 0.25% Trypsin to culture plates at 37 °C for 5 min. Add 4.5 ml differentiation medium to stop the reaction. Pipet up and down to dissociate EBs into single cells. Collect the cells by centrifuge and resuspend cells in 2% FBS/PBS for FACS-purification.\nRun undifferentiated ESCs on sorter as the negative control. Change voltage to adjust forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) to select desired population. Use forward scatter versus side scatter and forward scatter height versus width to exclude debris and doublet. In the selected sub-population, according to the distribution of ESC controls, draw a gate of YFP positive on histogram to eliminate cell autofluorescence. Collect YFP+ CPCs from YFP+ gating.\nPlate the purified CPCs (YFP+ cells) in 6-well plates with differentiation medium (1.3.1). Culture additional 3-5 days at 37 °C for differentiation of CPCs into cardiomyocytes and SMCs.\n2. Derivation of Human Embryonic CPCs from Human ESCs\nPrepare Feeders",
