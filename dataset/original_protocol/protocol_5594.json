    "Caution: N. meningitidis is classified as a class II pathogen. Therefore, all work with bacterial solutions must be done in a Class II biosafety cabinet and according to a national regulation of biosafety. In addition, all bacterial waste should be discarded as Infectious/Biohazardous.  Note: Before performing the experiment the OD600 value corresponding to viable count 108 cfu/ml has to be determined. For the bacterial stock used in this experiment, the OD600: 0.36 is 108 cfu/ml. This can be done by performing serial dilutions of cultures containing bacteria that have been grown on a GC plate for 16-18 h. The dilutions should then be plated on GC plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2 atmosphere.  Day 1 Preparation of overnight bacterial cultures. Work in a Class II biosafety cabinet.    N. meningitidis is streaked from a glycerol stock on a GC agar plate (see Recipes) supplemented with 10% Kellogg’s supplement (see Recipes) and incubated overnight for 16-18 h at 37 °C in an incubator with a 5% CO2 environment.    Day 2   Induction assay: Preparation and incubation of bacterial liquid cultures. Work in a Class II biosafety cabinet.   The Axio Observer microscope should be turned on and pre-warmed to 37 °C at least 30 min prior to your experiment. The CO2 should be set to 5% before inserting the multiwell plate to the microscope.   Prepare 30 ml pre-warmed DMEM (see Recipes) containing 1% FBS (DMEM/1% FBS, see Recipes). Fill 900 µl of the medium to the wells of 24-well glass bottom plate (MaTek) that will be used in the experiment (Figure 1). The multiwell plate should be warmed in a 37 °C incubator until needed in Step 1f. Note: Cultivation of N. meningitidis should always be performed with pre-warmed medium.",
    "In addition, the bacterial cultures should never be vortexed prior to experiments as this might induce shedding of bacterial pili, involved in microcolony formation.   Half fill a 10 µl loop with bacteria from the overnight culture and resuspend in 2 ml of DMEM/1% FBS. Mix the bacterial solution 4 times with a 1 ml pipette. Wait for 3 min and let the largest bacterial aggregates settle down to the bottom of the tube.   Transfer 1 ml of the uppermost bacterial solution, leaving the large aggregates behind, to a 50 ml Falcon tube containing 5 ml DMEM/1% FBS. Use a syringe to take up the bacterial solution and filter through a 5 µm-pore filter to a 15 ml Falcon tube. Note: In order to prevent variations in microcolony size that can occur due to differences in bacterial re-suspension, we filter the bacterial solution through 5 µm filter to break all pre-existing aggregates (Eriksson et al., 2012; Engman et al., 2016; Sigurlásdóttir et al., 2017).   Use a spectrophotometer to measure the absorbance of the bacteria solution. Adjust the absorbance to OD600 = 0.36 (equivalent to 108 cfu/ml) by diluting with DMEM/1%FBS.   Take the pre-warmed glass bottom plate from the incubator. Add 100 µl of bacterial solution to the wells containing 900 µl of DMEM/1%FBS (Figure 1). Mix 4 times with a 1 ml pipette. Start timing your 3 h incubation exactly when bacterial cultures are added to the multi-well plate. Write down the exact time when the cultures are added to the wells. Keep the 15 ml Falcon tube containing the bacterial solution for viable count (see Step 2a).   Immediately transfer the multi-well plate to the pre-warmed microscope. Incubate for 3 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 to allow bacteria to form microcolonies.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180116/20180116002154_5362.jpg Figure 1.",
    "Schematic drawing of experimental setup in the multiwell plate. Initially, bacterial culture is added to all relevant wells and incubated for 3 h under a microscope. After the incubation, lactate solutions are added to wells according to the scheme and the time-lapse started.      Preparation during the 3 h incubation   Perform serial dilutions and plating of the bacterial culture. Note: Immediately after the 3 h incubation starts, the viable count (108 cfu/ml) of the bacterial culture has to be confirmed by performing serial dilutions and plating.     Dilute the bacterial solution (OD600 = 0.36) by 105 (five 10x dilutions, 50 µl:450 µl) in duplicates and plate 100 µl (10x dilution) of the last dilution to GC plates.    Incubate the GC plates in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C overnight.    Count colonies and calculate the viable count (cfu/ml).    Prepare the microscope.    In AxioVision software, open multidimensional acquisition from the acquisition on the main tab. In the multidimensional window, click the experiment tab and choose time-lapse and position-list (Figure 2A). Choose a name for your experiment. Settings for experiment should be set to brightfield (BF). The Colibri, which is used for fluorescent microscopy only, should always be turned off and the halogen lamp (HAL), which is used for BF, should be turned off after the experiment.    In the C tab (channel) choose brightfield in the Dye section and make sure that BF is turned on during acquisition and HAL off after acquisition. Set focus to current (Figure 2B).   imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180116/20180116002838_2667.jpg Figure 2. Settings in the AxioVision multidimensional acquisition experiment (A) and channel (B) tabs    In the T tab (time) choose time-lapse and interval (Figure 3A). To follow the effect on microcolony dispersal, set the multidimensional acquisition to capture image every 5 or 10 min for 5 h total (8 h total incubation).",
    "In the XY tab, choose both position-list and apply settings before/after timepoint per position (Figure 3B). Click Mark Find and a new window will open. Choose a 24-well plate from the slide/dish collection. Choose the first well containing bacterial solution, well B2 according to the scheme in Figure 1. Click on the live button on the main tab or through acquisition on the main tab. By using bright field illumination and a 40x lens, adjust the focus and set three random positions per well. Place the positions not too close to each other and not too close to the edge of the well, see graphic selected well in Figure 4. Save your positions.    Start preparing and pre-warming lactate solutions (see Recipes) at different concentrations in DMEM 1 h before addition to microcolonies. The prepared lactate solutions can be kept either in 37 °C incubator or a heating block until addition to microcolonies. For a control, pre-warm DMEM as well.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180116/20180116002921_3750.jpg Figure 3. Settings in the AxioVision multidimensional acquisition time (A) and xy (B) tabs  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180116/20180116003000_8187.jpg Figure 4. Mark Find window in AxioVision. The image shows how three random positions within a well should be located.      Induction assay: addition of lactate to microcolonies and time-lapse imaging    After 3 h incubation, open the incubator unit and add 1 ml of each lactate solutions and DMEM control to relevant wells (see scheme in Figure 1). Note that the solutions have to be added quickly but also carefully, so the microcolonies will not be flushed away from the position chosen. Close the incubator unit.   After all the solutions have been added to relevant wells, quickly examine the positions chosen in the microscope and make sure that the microcolonies chosen have not moved out of position upon addition of lactate solutions.",
    "If they do not contain microcolonies, quickly relocate the position. The exposure time needs to be adjusted before starting time lapse. All the adjustments have to be done within 10 min so the time-lapse can be started exactly at 10 min after addition of lactate.   Start image acquisition, at every 5 or 10 min for 5 h. To avoid differences in timing, capture images in the same order as lactate was added to the wells. Analyze the time-lapse with either the AxioVision software or the Fiji software (see Data analysis)."
