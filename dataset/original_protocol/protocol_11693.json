    "All the procedures involving animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and performed in compliance with institutional guidelines and regulations. Female 129S4 mice at 1.5-6 months of age and housed at a sub-thermoneutral temperature of 21-23 °C were used for embryo harvests. A schematic workflow of the protocol is represented in Figure 1. See the Table of Materials for details regarding all materials, equipment, software, reagents, and animals used in this protocol.\n1. Harvesting E11.5 mouse embryos\nEuthanize pregnant female mouse 11.5 days after detection of vaginal plug during timed mating in a CO2 chamber using IACUC-approved CO2 flow rate required for approximately 50% displacement (2.95 L/min in a 360 in3 chamber) and duration of exposure (see Table of Materials). Perform cervical dislocation as a secondary method of euthanasia. Proceed immediately to dissection.\nLay the mouse body on a dissecting board with the ventral side facing up. Spray the mouse abdomen with 70% ethanol.\nOpen the abdominal cavity by pinching and lifting the skin anterior to the vaginal opening with straight Semken forceps and cutting the lifted skin and underlying layers with straight blade surgical scissors at a 45° angle on either side to generate a \"V\" shape that extends to each lateral surface roughly half-way between the forelimbs and hindlimbs.\nUsing the Semken forceps, grip one of the uterine horns and cut below the oviduct and above the cervix with the surgical scissors. Cut away the mesometrium to allow for complete removal of the uterine horn.\nTransfer the dissected uterine horn to 10 mL of histology phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) [0.137 M NaCl, 2.68 mM KCl, 1.76 mM KH2PO4 monobasic, 10.14 mM Na2HPO4 dibasic, pH 7.4] in a 10 cm Petri dish.",
    "Remove the second uterine horn on the opposing side of the abdominal cavity using the same procedure described in steps 1.4-1.5.\nPlace the 10 cm Petri dish containing both uterine horns on ice if not proceeding immediately to the dissection of individual embryos (i.e., if a second female mouse will be dissected).\nUnder a dissecting stereo microscope, carefully dissect out each embryo from the uterine horns with Dumont #5 fine forceps. Slowly pull away the myometrium, decidua, and chorion. Tear and remove the relatively transparent amnion surrounding the embryo, and sever the umbilical cord connecting the embryo to the placenta.\nTransfer each dissected embryo to 2.5 mL of histology PBS in an individual well of a 12-well cell culture plate on ice using a cut plastic transfer pipet or an embryo spoon.\n\t​NOTE: If working with a litter that may contain embryos of more than one genotype, save the amnion surrounding each embryo for genotyping by placing each in its own prelabeled 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tube on ice.\n2. Dissecting maxillary processes from E11.5 mouse embryos\nPrepare three 10 cm Petri dishes containing 10 mL of histology PBS and keep them on ice to be used in rotation between embryos.\nTransfer one embryo from an individual well of the 12-well cell culture plate to one of the 10 cm Petri dishes with histology PBS on ice using a cut plastic transfer pipet or an embryo spoon.\nUnder the dissecting microscope, separate each maxillary process from the face using the fine forceps. First, cut the anterior side of one maxillary process along the natural indentation separating the lateral nasal process and the maxillary process (Figure 2A).\nSecond, cut the posterior side of the maxillary process along the natural indentation separating the maxillary process and the mandibular process (Figure 2A).",
    "Third, to completely separate the maxillary process, make a vertical cut from the anterior to posterior sides of the maxillary process on the eye side of the maxillary process where the natural indentations referenced above end (Figure 2A-C).\nRepeat these three cuts for the maxillary process on the opposing side of the face.\nUsing a 9\" Pasteur pipet with a 2 mL small latex bulb, transfer the dissected pair of maxillary processes and a small droplet of approximately 30 µL of histology PBS to a labeled 35 mm Petri dish on ice (Figure 2D).\nFollow steps 2.3-2.7 for each embryo, rotating the three 10 cm Petri dishes containing histology PBS on ice between embryos. Place individual pairs of dissected maxillary processes in separate 35 mm Petri dishes on ice.\n\tNOTE: Separation of the maxillary process ectoderm and mesenchyme (steps 2.9-2.17) can be performed after dissecting the maxillary processes of all embryos in the litter. If intact maxillary processes containing both the ectoderm and mesenchyme are desired, proceed to step 2.18 below.\nPrepare 250 µL of fresh 2% trypsin in tissue culture PBS and 250 µL of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in tissue culture PBS and store on ice.\nPlace a second, small droplet of approximately 30 µL of 2% trypsin in the 35 mm Petri dish separate from the first, small droplet of histology PBS containing the maxillary processes. Transfer the pair of maxillary processes to the small droplet of 2% trypsin using the Pasteur pipet (Figure 2D).\nIncubate the dish on ice for 15 min.\nRemove the 35 mm Petri dish from the ice and place under the dissecting microscope.\nUsing the fine forceps, slowly and carefully pull off the layer of ectoderm from each maxillary process (Figure 2E).",
    "NOTE: If the ectoderm is not separating from the mesenchyme in an intact sheet, incubate in 2% trypsin at room temperature (RT) for up to 5 additional min before continuing with separation. If the tissue starts to disintegrate in the 2% trypsin, move the maxillary processes to the 10% FBS as described below to neutralize the trypsin and finish the separation of the ectoderm and mesenchyme.\nOnce the maxillary process ectoderm and mesenchyme are separated (Figure 2F), transfer the desired tissues from the pair of maxillary processes to a third, small droplet of approximately 30 µL of 10% FBS - separate from the two previous small droplets - using the Pasteur pipet (Figure 2D).\nPlace the 35 mm Petri dish on ice to stop the trypsinization.\nIncubate the maxillary process tissues on ice in 10% FBS for 1-2 min, and then transfer the tissues from both maxillary processes to a fourth, small droplet of approximately 30 µL of prechilled histology PBS on ice - separate from the three previous small droplets - using the Pasteur pipet (Figure 2D).\nIncubate the maxillary process tissues in histology PBS for 1 min while gently swirling the histology PBS around the maxillary process tissues with the tip of the Pasteur pipet to ensure that all FBS is rinsed off the tissue.\nTransfer the pair of maxillary process tissues to a labeled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube on ice using the Pasteur pipet, minimizing the transfer of histology PBS. Remove any excess histology PBS in the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube with the Pasteur pipet.\nFollow the above steps to dissect the maxillary processes from each embryo in the litter.",
    "Process the samples immediately to isolate whole cell protein lysates (below) or store at -80 °C long-term. Prior to long-term storage, snap-freeze the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube in a bath of 100% EtOH on dry ice for 5 min.\n3. Isolating whole cell protein lysates from mouse maxillary processes\nIf maxillary processes were previously frozen at -80 °C, thaw them on ice.\nAdd 0.1 mL of ice-cold NP-40 lysis buffer (20 mM Tris HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM EDTA; stored at 4 °C) with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1x complete mini protease inhibitor cocktail [dissolved in water; stored at -20 °C], 1 mM PMSF [dissolved in isopropanol; stored at 4 °C], 10 mM NaF [stored at -20 °C; avoid freeze/thaw], 1 mM Na3VO4 [stored at -20 °C], 25 mM β-glycerophosphate [stored at 4 °C]) added immediately before use on ice.\n\tNOTE: Cell fractionation can alternatively be performed to isolate cytoplasmic, nuclear, membrane, or mitochondrial protein fractions.\nPipet up and down 10 times with a 200 µL pipetman.\nVortex for 10 s, and then pipet up and down 10 times with a 200 µL pipetman. Avoid generating bubbles.\nIncubate at 4 °C for 2 h while rotating end over end using a 1.5 mL/2 mL paddle with a tube revolver.\nCentrifuge the samples at 13,500 × g for 20 min at 4 °C.\nCollect the supernatant to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube on ice with a 200 mL pipetman.\nQuantify the protein concentration with the protein assay kit, using 10 μL of protein lysate + 10 μL of NP-40 lysis buffer for experimental samples and 3-5 dilutions of bovine serum albumin (fraction V) (BSA) in NP-40 lysis buffer at a range of 0.25-2.0 mg/mL as protein standards.",
    "Proceed with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (step 5) or quickly freeze the remaining lysates on dry ice and store at -80 °C long-term.\n4. Isolating whole cell protein lysates from primary and/or immortalized mouse embryonic palatal mesenchyme (MEPM) cells\nNOTE: Isolation and culture of primary MEPM cells from E13.5 mouse embryos and immortalized MEPM cells have been previously described32,33,34. Stimulation of cells with growth factor (steps 4.1-4.7) can be performed prior to cell lysis. If non-stimulated cells are desired, proceed to step 4.8 below.\nAspirate the growth medium [Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 50 U/mL of penicillin, 50 µg/mL of streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 10% FBS] from the MEPM cells at ~70% confluence in a 6 cm cell culture dish using a 5.75\" Pasteur pipet attached to a vacuum system.\nWash the cells with 1 mL of tissue culture PBS.\nAdd 3 mL of serum starvation medium [DMEM with 50 U/mL of penicillin, 50 µg/mL of streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.1% FBS] prewarmed in a 37 °C water bath.\nIncubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 23 h.\nReplace the serum starvation medium with 3 mL of fresh, prewarmed serum starvation medium.\nIncubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 1 h.\nStimulate the cells with the growth factor of choice at an empirically-determined concentration for the desired length of time.\nAspirate the medium from the MEPM cells at 80%-100% confluence using a 5.75\" Pasteur pipet attached to a vacuum system.\nWash the cells twice with ice-cold tissue culture PBS (1 mL for a 6 cm cell culture dish); tilt the plate to the side during the last wash to ensure all the tissue culture PBS is aspirated.",
    "Lyse the cells by adding ice-cold NP-40 lysis buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors added immediately before use (0.1 mL for a 6 cm cell culture dish) on ice.\nIncubate the plate on ice for 5 min with rotation approximately every min to ensure complete coverage of the plate.\nScrape the cells off the plate using a precooled cell lifter and transfer the cell suspension to a precooled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube on ice.\nIncubate the cell suspension at 4 °C for 30 min while rotating end over end using a 1.5 mL/2 mL paddle with a tube revolver.\nProceed with steps 3.6-3.9 described above.\n5. Western blotting of whole cell protein lysates from mouse facial processes and/or MEPM cells for phosphoproteins\nPrepare whole cell protein lysate samples for SDS-PAGE.\n\t\nDetermine the amount of protein to be loaded, depending on protein abundance in the tissue/cell; 12.5 μg is usually sufficient for robustly-expressed proteins in whole cell protein lysates.\nAdd an equal volume of 2x Laemmli buffer [20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 0.004% bromophenol blue, 0.125 M Tris HCl pH 6.8] with 10% β-mercaptoethanol added immediately before use.\n\t\tCAUTION: β-mercaptoethanol is skin or eye corrosive, toxic, hazardous if swallowed, and has aquatic toxicity. Handle wearing gloves, a laboratory coat, face shield, and safety glasses in a chemical fume hood. Dispose of according to Environmental Health and Safety guidelines.\nMix by vortexing.\nHeat the samples at 100 °C for 5 min in a mini dry bath.\nMix by vortexing and place the samples on ice.\nCentrifuge at 9,400 × g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nPlace the samples briefly on ice before loading into SDS-PAGE gel, or store at -20 °C long-term.\nPerform SDS-PAGE using an electrophoresis cell with a 4%-15% precast protein gel and electrophoresis buffer35.",
    "Electrotransfer the proteins to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane using transfer buffer with 0%-20% methanol (0%-10% for proteins greater than 100 kDa; 20% for proteins less than 100 kDa) added immediately before use35.\nBlock the membrane and probe for phosphoprotein of interest.\n\t\nFollowing transfer, wash the membrane in 1x tris-buffered saline (TBS) [20 mM Tris, 0.137 M NaCl, pH 7.6] for 5 min in a western blot box.\nIncubate the membrane in 5 mL of blocking buffer [1x TBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% w/v BSA; mixed well and filtered through a 25 mm syringe filter with 0.2 μm pores using a 10 mL syringe with luer tip] for 1 h in a western blot box with agitation on an orbital shaker.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not use milk as a blocking agent when characterizing phosphoproteins as it contains the phosphoprotein casein, which can cause a high, non-specific background signal.\nWash the membrane three times for 5 min each in TBS-T [1x TBS, 0.1% Tween 20] in a western blot box with agitation on an orbital shaker.\nIncubate the membrane in 5 mL of primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer at 4 °C overnight in a 50 mL conical tube using a 50 mL paddle with a tube revolver.\n\t\tNOTE: Consult the antibody datasheet for the appropriate concentration for western blotting.\nWash the membrane three times at RT for 5 min each in TBS-T in a western blot box with agitation on an orbital shaker.\nIncubate the membrane in 5 mL of appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h in a western blot box with agitation on an orbital shaker.\nWash the membrane three times for 5 min each in TBS-T in a western blot box with agitation on an orbital shaker.",
    "Incubate the membrane in enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) western blotting substrate [mixing equal volumes from bottles 1 and 2; 0.5 mL of each for large (8.6 cm x 6.7 cm) membranes] for 1 min, ensuring that the entire membrane is continually exposed to the ECL western blotting substrate.\nDrain the membrane of excess ECL western blotting substrate and immediately develop using a chemiluminescence imager.\nStrip the membrane and reprobe for total protein of interest.\n\t\nPlace the PVDF membrane in a transparent pouch with polyethylene lining containing 5 mL of stripping buffer [2% SDS, 62.5 mM Tris HCl pH 6.8] with 8 μL/mL of β-mercaptoethanol added immediately before use.\nIncubate at 50 °C for 30 min with rocking in a hybridization oven at 11 revolutions per minute.\nWash the membrane three times at RT for 5 min each in TBS-T in a western blot box with agitation on an orbital shaker.\nProceed with steps 5.4.2-5.4.9 described above.\nQuantitate western blot band densities using ImageJ software, normalizing the levels of the phosphorylated protein of interest to the levels of the total protein of interest36.\nSubscription Required.
