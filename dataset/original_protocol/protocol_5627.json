    "Dissection and staining of wing imaginal discs Note: For a more detailed protocol, see Klein (2008). Under the dissection microscope: In chilled Ringer’s solution (see Recipes), dissect 3rd instar larvae, turning them inside out while leaving wing imaginal discs attached to the carcass. Remove as much unwanted tissue as possible (fat body, intestine, salivary glands)Fix in Solution A (made fresh; see Recipes) on ice for 20 min.Wash 3 x with PBT (see Recipes) each for 10 min.Block in Solution B (see Recipes) for 1 h at room temperature.Perform immunostaining following the standard protocol (Klein, 2008).Post-fix in Solution A for 1 h at room temperature.Wash 3 x with PBT each for 10 min.Embedding in gelatinIn a glass 9-well plate, add 300 µl of 50 °C of Solution D (gelatin, see Recipes) to each well. Ensure that the surface of the solution is level and free of bubblesPlace on ice for 30 min to allow the gel to solidify. Note: Try to prevent condensation from forming on glass 9-well plate, as falling droplets might dilute the gelatin solution and interfere with gelation.Under the dissection microscope: Gently remove the wing discs from carcasses in PBT.Using a pipette, transfer the wing discs into a well of Solution C (sucrose, see Recipes) and incubate for about 60 min at room temperature.Transfer a single wing disc by pipette (in about 20 µl of liquid) from the sucrose solution onto the solidified gelatin (Figure 2A).Note: The disc should be placed directly into the middle of the well.Remove as much excess liquid as possible, ensuring that the disc is lying flat on the gel (Figure 2B).Apply an additional 300 µl of 50 °C Solution D (gelatin) on top of the wing disc (Figure 2C).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180201/20180201192558_7905.jpgFigure 2.

    "Transfer a wing disc to the gelatin by pipette. B. Remove excess sucrose solution from around the disc. C. Add an addition 300 µl of gelatin on top of the disc.Place on ice and allow the gel to solidify about 30 min.Under a dissecting microscope, use a razor blade to cut the gelatin into a block around the sample.Note: This should be done with regard to the desired orientation of the cryosection. For example, if cross-sections are desired across the wing pouch dorso-ventrally, one face of the gel block should be perpendicular to the dorsoventral boundary (Figures 3A and 3C).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180201/20180201192630_9846.jpgFigure 3.

Top-down view of a wing disc in gelatin cube. The red line indicates the face of the cube which should be placed face-down into the embedding capsule to acquire a dorsoventrally aligned section. B. ‘edge-on’ view of the wing disc from the direction indicated by the arrow in A. C. An alternatively angled cube which would allow for sections aligned 45° to the dorsoventral boundary. The red line indicates face of the cube which should be placed downward.Prepare a plastic embedding capsule by cutting off the conical tip with a razor (Figures 4A-4B). Place the gel cube with the desired face down onto the lid of a plastic embedding capsule (Figures 3B and 4C).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180201/20180201192707_8043.jpgFigure 4. Preparation of plastic embedding capsule. A. Plastic embedding capsule (Step B8 above). B. Cut the conical tip off from the capsule using a razor blade (the arrow indicates movement of the blade). Discard the conical tip. C. Place the sample with the desired cutting face downward onto the lid of the capsule (red cube, indicated by arrow).",
    "D. Close the capsule and fill from the top with tissue freezing medium (arrow indicates where to add medium).Gently fill the capsule with tissue freezing medium, allowing large air bubbles to escape (Figure 4D).Place capsule immediately into dry ice or a -80 °C freezer.CryosectioningRemove the frozen sample from the plastic embedding capsule. This is achieved by first removing the lid, then cutting away the remainder of the plastic capsule with a razor blade. Affix the sample to a cold (-80 °C) microtome sample holder using tissue freezing medium (Figures 5A-5B).With the cryostat chamber set to -24 °C, place the holder in the microtome (Figure 5C).Cut sections of 10-20 µm thickness. The anti-roll plate ensures a flat section comes off the knife (Video 1).Pick up tissue sections by gently touching a glass microscope slide to them. Create a row of sections (Video 1).Check under a fluorescence microscope for the presence of disc tissue in gelatin slices, and mark their location on the back of the slide.Add Fluoromount-G® atop the samples.Place a coverslip over the slide, seal with nail polish.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180201/20180201192810_6896.jpgFigure 5.

The anti-roll plate, which is lowered at the beginning of the video, ensures the section remains flat. Note tissue sections will adhere to the microscope slide after gently coming in contact."
