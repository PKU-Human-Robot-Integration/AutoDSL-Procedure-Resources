    "All applicable international, national, and/or institutional guidelines for the care and use of animals were followed. All efforts were made to reduce the number of animals for the project and to minimize their suffering.\n1. Preparation of the developing solution, the etching solutions, the organic semiconductor solution, and the photolithographic masks\nPrepare the developing solution by diluting NaOH pellets in deionized water at a concentration of 175 mM.\n\tNOTE: This is an exothermic reaction. If a plastic container is used, keep agitating the container until all pellets are completely dissolved.\nPrepare the titanium etching solution by diluting hydrofluoric acid (HF) in deionized water (1 part of concentrated 48% HF, 49 parts deionized water).\n\tCAUTION: Hydrofluoric acid can easily penetrate the skin, causing severe damage to deep tissue layers. Rapid neutralization of HF is necessary to prevent tissue destruction, which may continue for days and result in severe injury or even death. The risks associated with HF are dependent on the concentration and the duration of contact with the acid. Use only under a fume hood using a face shield. Double gloving is also strongly recommended.\nPrepare the gold etching solution by mixing iodine, potassium iodide, and deionized water (for 250 g of solution, use 200 mL of deionized water, 20 g of KI, 5 g of I2). Stir the solution at room temperature for 1 h and leave it resting overnight before use.\nPrepare the semiconductor solution by dissolving 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) pentacene (TIPS Pentacene) in anisole (1% in weight) and gently stirring for 2 h on a hot plate at 80 °C.\n\tNOTE: Keep agitating this solution. Use amber glass vials and/or store them in low light conditions.",
    "Prepare the desired photolithographic mask set with a vector graphics software. Prepare 5 masks for the entire process: the mask for the patterning of the floating gates (FGs); the mask for the opening of the vias and the sensing areas for the electrophysiological recordings; the mask for the self-alignment process; the mask for the patterning of the source, drain and control gate top contact; and the mask for the plasma activation of the pH channels.\n\t​NOTE: Depending on the necessary resolution and the specific photolithographic setup, different kinds of masks could be used. In the case of the proposed devices (which have a maximum lateral resolution of 40 µm), simple plastic flexible masks have been bought at a local photocopy shop.\n2. Substrate selection and preparation\nCut a 6 x 6 cm2 square of 250 µm polyethylene terephthalate (PET) from a pristine PET sheet.\n\tNOTE: Start with a slightly bigger substrate than the final device to have wide enough margins to allow for manipulation with standard lab tweezers without damaging it.\nInspect the substrate with an optical microscope to exclude the presence of deep grooves and scratches. Carefully select the less scratched substrates as bigger imperfections may lead to the failure of the final device.\nRinse the PET substrates with acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and deionized water (in this order) and dry them using streams of nitrogen. Store the substrates in clean plastic Petri dishes/containers.\n3. FG: titanium deposition\nPre-clean the substrates with plasma oxygen (30 s at 100 W) and place them on the substrate holder inside the vacuum chamber of the thermal evaporator.",
    "Place 60 mg of titanium in the crucible, close the shutter, and pump down the evaporation chamber until it reaches a vacuum level lower than 10-6 Torr. Increase the power of the evaporator until the crucible glows red and wait for 30 s. Open the shutter, increase the power to 60% (or until the crucible glows bright white), and wait for 60 s. Close the shutter and turn down the power.\nRemove the substrates from the evaporator; clean them using acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and deionized water; and dry them using streams of nitrogen. Perform a second oxygen plasma treatment (60 s at 200 W) to slightly oxidize the titanium surface.\n4. FG patterning\nPlace one substrate at a time on the spin coater placed inside a fume hood. Deposit 4 mL of photoresist on the substrate using a disposable plastic pipette. Use the following spin coating parameters to obtain a 2 µm-thick photoresist layer: spin speed: 3000 rpm; spin time: 45 s; acceleration time: 0.5 s; deceleration time: 0.5 s.\nSoft bake the photoresist by placing the substrate on a hot plate (70 °C for 5 min). Store the substrate inside an aluminum foil-wrapped Petri dish/plastic container to avoid direct light exposure.\n\tNOTE: Avoid the suggested bake temperature (100 °C for 50 s) to prevent substrate deformation. However, baking at a lower temperature for a longer time ensures good results.\nPlace the device in a bromograph and position the plastic photolithographic mask with the desired FG layout onto the substrate. Expose to ultraviolet (UV) light from the top for 1 min, and carefully remove the mask, taking care to minimize the lateral movements of the mask over the substrate to avoid scratching it.",
    "Plunge the substrate for 5 s in a glass container filled with the developing solution (step 1.1). Quickly rinse it in deionized water and dry it under nitrogen. Use an optical microscope to look for underdeveloped/overdeveloped spots in the substrate. Repeat the immersion of the substrate in developing solution in case of underdevelopment.\nEtch the exposed titanium by submerging it in the titanium etching solution (step 1.2) for 15 s, rinse it with deionized water, and dry it using nitrogen. Optically inspect the substrate and remove the photoresist using acetone. Rinse the substrate with isopropyl alcohol and deionized water, and dry it with nitrogen.\n5. Gate dielectric deposition\nPrepare the deposition chamber of the Parylene coater by distributing 2 mL of the adhesion promoter (silane - 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate) on the deposition chamber walls using a laboratory wipe. Place 300 mg of Parylene C dimer (corresponding to a final thickness of 150 nm) onto the Parylene coater. Set the lower pressure value to 7 mbar and the higher pressure value to 10 mbar. After the deposition, clean the substrates with acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and deionized water, and dry them with nitrogen.\n6. Opening of the sensing areas of the OCMFET for electrical activity recording and formation of the vias to access the back of the FGs\nDeposit the photoresist on the substrates using the same parameters of steps 4.1 and 4.2.",
    "Place the device in a bromograph and position the plastic photolithographic mask onto the substrate for the vias (circular openings with a diameter of 50 µm over the sensing areas and 100 x 100 µm2 openings over the FGs away from the sensing areas (referred to as back contact of the FGs in Figure 1 and Figure 2)) under a stereoscopic microscope to improve the alignment precision. Expose to UV light from the top for 1 min, and carefully remove the mask, taking care to minimize the lateral movements of the mask over the substrate to avoid scratching it.\n\tNOTE: The vias on the side of the FGs away from the sensing area (shown as back contact of FGs in Figure 1 and Figure 2) are necessary for contact during the characterization of the transistor. Moreover, having electrical access to the FGs may be very useful for different types of functionalization (e.g., electrodeposition).\nDevelop the photoresist as previously described in step 4.4. Expose the substrate with the patterned photoresist (which acts as a mask here) to oxygen plasma (180 s at 200 W) to remove the Parylene C from the sensing areas.\n\tNOTE: The etching rate of Parylene C in an isotropic plasma cleaner at 200 W is approximately 90 nm/min. A slight over-etch is performed to further clean the sensing areas. The photoresist is also etched during the process. However, its thickness (2 µm) is much higher than that of the Parylene C.\nPlace the substrates into a glass container filled with acetone inside the ultrasonic bath for 10 s to remove the photoresist completely. Rinse the substrates with acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and water and dry them with nitrogen.",
    "​NOTE: Using sonication instead of simply rinsing the substrates with acetone is crucial to prevent undesired folding and re-deposition of Parylene C fragments onto the surface of the sensing areas.\n7. Self-alignment of source and drain with the FG\nDeposit the photoresist on the substrates using the same parameters of steps 4.1 and 4.2. Place the device in a bromograph and position onto the substrate a plastic photolithographic mask with simple black rectangles that completely cover the transistor's areas. Expose to UV light for 1 min from both the top and the bottom, and carefully remove the mask, taking care to minimize the lateral movements of the mask over the substrate to avoid scratching it.\n\t​NOTE: With the double-sided exposure, the FGs act as photolithographic masks with respect to the bottom exposure, while the presence of the top mask ensures that only the photoresist present on the transistors' channel remains unexposed.\nDevelop the photoresist as previously described in step 4.4.\n8. Gold deposition, channel formation, and patterning of the sources, drains, and control gates\nClean the substrates with a gentle plasma treatment (30 s at 30 W) to promote the adhesion of the metal on the Parylene C and place them on the substrate holder inside the vacuum chamber of the thermal evaporator.\nPlace 30 mg of gold in the crucible, close the shutter, and pump down the evaporation chamber until it reaches 10-5 Torr. Increase the power of the evaporator until the crucible glows red and wait for 30 s. Open the shutter, increase the power to 40% (or until the crucible glows bright white), wait for 60 s, close the shutter, and turn down the power.",
    "Place the substrates into an acetone container inside the ultrasonic bath for 10 s to lift off the photoresist, thus removing the gold from the transistors' channel. Rinse the substrates with acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and water and dry them with nitrogen. Deposit the photoresist on the substrates using the same parameters of steps 4.1 and 4.2.\nPlace the device in a bromograph and position onto the substrate a plastic photolithographic mask with the desired sources, drains, and control gate layout. Expose to UV light for 1 min from the top, and carefully remove the mask, taking care to minimize the lateral movements of the mask over the substrate to avoid scratching it.\nDevelop the photoresist as described in step 4.4. Etch the exposed gold by submerging it in the gold etching solution (step 1.3) for 10 s, rinse it with deionized water, and dry it out using nitrogen. Optically inspect the substrate and remove the photoresist using acetone. Rinse with isopropyl alcohol and deionized water and dry it with nitrogen.\n9. Deposition and activation of the Parylene C for pH sensing\nDeposit the photoresist on the substrates using the same parameters of steps 4.1 and 4.2.\nPlace the device in a bromograph and position onto the substrate a plastic photolithographic mask with openings corresponding to the pH-sensing areas of the OCMFETs. Expose to UV light for 1 min from the top, and carefully remove the mask, taking care to minimize the lateral movements of the mask over the substrate to avoid scratching it.",
    "Develop the photoresist as described in step 4.4. Protect the whole device, except for the pH-sensing areas, with polyimide insulation tape (see the Table of Materials). Deposit a layer of 500 nm of Parylene C (corresponding to 1 g of Parylene C dimer) on the substrate using the same parameters described in step 5.1.\n\tNOTE: The total Parylene C thickness on the pH-sensing areas is 650 nm. No silane is required for this deposition.\nCarefully remove the polyimide insulation tape. Expose the substrate to oxygen plasma (5 min and 30 s at 200 W) to activate the Parylene C on the pH-sensing areas of the OCMFETs.\n\tNOTE: The polyimide insulation tape is necessary here to limit the Parylene C deposition. In fact, a simple lift-off using the photoresist does not give positive results due to the almost pinhole-free nature of the conformal coating obtained with Parylene C.\nPlace the substrates into an acetone container inside the ultrasonic bath for 10 s to completely remove the photoresist. Rinse the substrates with acetone and isopropyl alcohol (no water) and dry them with nitrogen.\n10. Semiconductor deposition, culturing chamber placing, and final cut-out of the device from the PET\nPlace the substrates onto a hot plate at 50 °C. Cast a droplet (1 µL) of semiconductor solution (step 1.4) onto each channel area, cover the whole substrate with a lid, and let it dry out under a chemical hood for 30 min.",
    "Prepare the culturing chamber by printing an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ring with an internal radius of 15 mm, a thickness of 1 mm, and a height of 7 mm with a 3D printer. Glue the culturing chamber onto the central part of the substrate using polydimethylsiloxane (ratio of the curing agent: 15% by weight). Cut out the device from the PET either manually or using a laser cutter.\n11. Electrical characterization of transistors\nCharacterize each transistor using a sourcemeter18,19,20,21 (see the Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Both the output and the input characteristics should be measured to extrapolate the transistors' parameters (mainly the carriers' mobility, threshold voltage, ION/IOFF ratio, and subthreshold slope)."
