    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDiscovery proteomics study for swab samples\nTiming: 2 days—Day 2 and Day 3\nTiming: 21 h for step 1\nTiming: 4–6 h for step 2\nTiming: 3–4 h, per sample, for step 3\nTiming: 4–6 h for step 4\nTiming: 2–4 h for step 5\nTiming: 2 h for step 6\nIn the discovery proteomics study, label-free quantification (LFQ) is performed for the swab samples with an aim to identify the total number of proteins present in the swab samples. In LFQ experimental design, the proteins are trypsinized to generate peptides. These peptides are then analyzed using LC-MS/MS to generate raw data consisting of peptide sequences. These peptide sequences are then mapped to FASTA with suitable search engines such as Maxquant or Proteome Discoverer to identify the proteins. Further statistical and pathway analysis helped us to understand the significant and differential proteins expressed in each disease type contributing to their respective pathway and biology.\nDay 2: Sample preparation for Label-Free-Quantification (LFQ) based mass spectrometry analysis\nDissolving the protein pellets in a suitable buffer\nAdd 75 μL of freshly prepared lysis buffer (8 M urea, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 75 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2) to the protein pellet obtained from each solvent (acetone, ethanol and isopropanol).\nDissolve the protein pellets in freshly prepared lysis buffer by vortexing.\nPool the proteins extracted from solvents (i.e., Ethanol, Acetone and Isopropanol). Further, it can be stored at −80°C or processed immediately by in-solution digestion.",
    "Note: Urea buffer with Tris is used for lysis as Urea is a denaturant that helps to open the three-dimensional structure of proteins, which helps in digestion. This lysis buffer should be freshly prepared each time you begin your experiment. The pool of protein from Ethanol, Acetone and Isopropanol solvent extraction was made because the combination of these three yielded more SARS-CoV-2 unique peptides after in-solution digestion followed by mass spectrometry analysis (Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1442-Mmc1.pdf] and Figure S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1442-Mmc1.pdf]).\nReduction and alkylation\nQuantify the swab lysate mix by Bradford assay using Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) protein to plot the standard curve (B. P. A. I. M. BIORAD, no date[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Blagoev and Mann, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). The swab sample used in the study can have a concentration of ∼12μg/μL (total amount of protein ranges from 10–15 mg).\nRun the samples in 12% SDS-PAGE (P. G. E. BIORAD, no date[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; SDS-PAGE Gel, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]) to check for the protein profile. One should obtain a clear protein profile in the gel before proceeding with in-solution digestion and mass spectrometry analysis (Figure S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1442-Mmc1.pdf]).\nNote: SDS PAGE is run only for Quality Control purpose. The gel profile indicates whether the sample is good enough to take for digestion followed by Mass Spectrometric analysis, otherwise it will be detrimental for both columns and instrument.\nOptional: Samples should be loaded in duplicate. Use 10–15 μg of protein for Q.C. check.\nPlace 30 μg of swab lysate in a fresh 1.5 mL Axygen tube for enzymatic digestion (make the final volume to 20 μL).\nAdd 0.8 μL of 0.5 M TCEP (tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine solution, pH 7.0 for every 20 μL of swab lysate, to make final concentration of 20 mM.\nIncubate swab lysate with TCEP at 37°C for 60 min for reduction of proteins.",
    "Note: i. Use Axygen 1.5 mL tubes (MCT-150-C), ii. Preferably use 1–10 μL high precision pipettes, iii. keep on non-shaking incubator at 37°C for 1 h.\nAdd 1.6 μL of 0.5 M Iodoacetamide (IAA) solution for every 20 μL of swab lysate to make a final concentration of 40 mM and incubate at 37°C for 15 min in the dark.\nIn-solution digestion for generation of peptide\nDilute the alkylated sample by adding 4–5 volumes (60–80 μL) of dilution buffer (25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM CaCl2) so that the final concentration of Urea is less than 1 M. This is required for optimal activity of trypsin.\nCritical: Adjust pH of the solution to 8.0 with Sodium Hydroxide solution or HCl as per the supplier details. Check the pH using pH paper strip; use a drop of the sample on the paper and check the color as per the indicator.\nDigest the proteins by adding Pierce™ Trypsin Protease, MS Grade in 1:30 ratio (enzyme: protein) for 16 h at 37°C (Thermo Fisher, Digital Shaking Drybath - 500 rpm).\nNote: Preferably use 1–10 μL high precision pipettes for adding trypsin. Vortex briefly and give a short spin. Tap gently to remove air bubbles, if any.\nDay 3: Quenching, peptide desalting, and peptide quantification\nQuenching of trypsinization reaction\nStop trypsin activity reaction by completely drying the samples in a Savant Speed Vac. Concentrator (ISS 110) set at medium heat (∼ 43°C).\nPreparation of in-house C18 desalting tips\nTake a 20–200 μL (Tarson) tip and cut it below the mark.",
    "To prepare desalting tips, use the backside of a 10 μL tip to measure the amount of material (PK20 Empore Octadecyl C18 47 mm) required. DO NOT use material lower than this as it may not be sufficient to sit inside the tip well, resulting in loose packing and leakage.\nPack the tip with the material properly by making the surface even from all sides. If this is not done, the material might not get activated evenly.\nInsert this tip into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nNote: For further details of this protocol, one can refer these (Kumar et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]; Ghantasala et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; Verma et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]) and Figure S3[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1442-Mmc1.pdf].\nCritical: Please DO NOT use sharp objects like a needle to make the C18 desalting tips. Insert the material heads-up into the tip. Peptide binding capacity of these in-house C18 tip depends upon the amount of C18 material used, the average loading volume can be 20–30 μL (∼30 μg), recovery volume is around 15–20 μL (∼15 μg) of peptide.\nAlternatives: Commercially available Millipore® Ziptips C18, pack of 96, Pierce™ C18 Tips, 10 μL bed can be used as an alternative to these tips\nIn-house C18 tips desalting protocol: Activation\nPass 40 μL of 50% acetonitrile (ACN) with 0.1% formic acid (F.A.) three times from the in-house C18 tip (tip containing C18 material which is freshly prepared for peptide desalting from step (2.b). Centrifuge at 1500×g for 1 min (i.e., 40 μL, 1 min, 1500×g) to pass the solution through the tips.\nPass 99.9% ACN in 0.1% FA; 40 μL, 1 min, 1500×g. Repeat this step 3 times.\nNote: Pass 99.9% ACN in 0.1% F.A.; 40 μL, 3 times simultaneously for activating the C18 material present in the in-house C18 tip and the eluent is discarded each time.",
    "In-house C18 tips desalting protocol: Equilibration\nPass 0.1% F.A. in Milli-Q water; 40 μL, 1 min, 1500×g. Repeat this step 3 times.\nDiscard the remaining solvent with a syringe and insert the tip into a 1.5 mL sample tube.\nNote: As the peptide sample is reconstituted in the 0.1% F.A. in Milli-Q, C18 material in the in-house C18 tip is washed with 0.1% F.A. in Milli-Q water to equilibrate the in-house C18 tip with the sample buffer.\nIn-house C18 tips desalting protocol: Sample passing\nReconstitute the peptide sample in an appropriate volume (preferably 40 μL) of Milli Q water with 0.1% F.A. and add to the activated tip, which is passed through the tip by centrifugation for 1 min at 1000×g. The eluted peptide solution is again passed through the same in-house C18 tip (by centrifugation) at least 6 times (Figure S3[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1442-Mmc1.pdf]).\nNote: Here, the eluted peptide was reapplied and repeatedly passed through C18 material of the in-house C18 tip to maximize the binding of peptides with the C18 material\nIn-house C18 tips desalting protocol: Sample cleaning\nPass Milli Q water with 0.1% F.A.; 40 μL, 1 min, 1500×g. Repeat this step 3 times.\nDiscard the remaining solvent with a syringe and insert the tip into a fresh 1.5 mL tube.\nNote: Here, 0.1% F.A. was passed with the C18 material of the in-house C18 tip to remove and wash the unwanted salts present in the peptide solution.\nIn-house C18 tips desalting protocol: Sample elution\nPass 50% ACN in 0.1% FA; 60 μL, 1 min, 1000×g. Repeat this step 3 times. Fresh ACN aliquot is used each time and the elute was collectively pooled.\nPass 70% ACN in 0.1% F.A.; 60 μL, 3 min, 4000×g and pool the eluent with the eluent obtained from step (2. g.i).",
    "After pooled eluent is obtained from passing 50% ACN and 70% ACN elution, dry the eluent with Savant speed-vac (ISS 110) at low-temperature mode.\nNote: Once you have passed the peptide solution 6 times and washed the in-house C18 tip with 0.1% F.A. to remove the debris, pass 50% and 70% ACN in 0.1% F.A., sequentially to elute the peptides binding to the C18 material of the in-house C18 tip (Figure S3[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1442-Mmc1.pdf]).(Kumar et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]; Ghantasala et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; Verma et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]).\nQuantification of peptides\nReconstitute cleaned peptides in 15 μL of 0.1 % (v/v) formic acid (FA) in MQ water. Take the absorbance at 205 and 280 nm (e.g., using MultiSkan GO, Thermo Fisher Scientific).\nEstimate the peptide concentration using the Scopes method (Scopes, 1974[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]; Anthis and Clore, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nTake 1 μg of peptide forward for the mass spectrometry analysis.\nNote: Final peptide concentration is made to 0.25 μg/μL and 4 μL of peptide solution is injected into the nLC\nDay 3: Sample analysis with Mass Spectrometry (Discovery Proteomics Study)\nInstrumental Quality Assessment and Quality check\nUse a high resolution mass spectrometer to perform the deep proteomic analysis of thus prepared peptide samples.\nNote: We have used Orbitrap Fusion™ coupled to EASY-nLC™ 1200 System for the discovery proteomic analysis of COVID-19 swab samples.\nCalibrate the instrument, as per requirement.\nNote: Both MS and MS/MS calibration should be carried out at the regular intervals (monthly and at the beginning of a new batch of an experiment). For Orbitrap Fusion calibration was done with Pierce™ LTQ Velos ESI Positive Ion Calibration Solution - which includes caffeine (2 μg/mL), MRFA (1 μg/mL), Ultramark 1621 (0.001%) and n-butylamine (0.0005%) in an aqueous solution of acetonitrile (50%), methanol (25%) and acetic acid (1%) - as per manufacturer's instructions (Catalog, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nNanospray columns",
    "Note: The column outline from the L.C. is connected to the precolumn/trap column using Viper union, the trap column is connected to the Analytical column using Mixing / Venting Tee (Fisher Scientific Inc, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). The analytical column is then placed near to sweep cone and Ion transfer capillary with the EASY-Spray NG source (Figure S4[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1442-Mmc1.pdf]).\nFor the above mentioned setup, use precolumn Acclaim PepMap TM 100, 100 μm∗2 cm, nanoviper C18, 5 μm,100 Å.\nNote: Precolumn is mainly involved in conditioning the mobile phase before it reaches to the analytical column of nanoLC.\nFor the Analytical column, use PepMap TM RSLC C18 2 μm,100 Å, 75 μm∗50 cm.\nNote: Analytical column is generally involved in qualitative analysis and results in fractionation of peptide samples according to their hydrophobicity.\nLiquid Chromatography System used for Discovery Proteomics Study\nThermo EASY-nLC™ 1200 System has been used for the discovery phase proteomics, operated at a flow rate of 300 nL/min.\nSolvent A is composed of 0.1% F.A. in M.S. grade water, and solvent B comprises 80% ACN with 0.1% F.A. in M.S. grade water.\nUse an L.C. gradient of 120 min to separate peptides on the nLC column.\nSolvent B increased from 5 to 30% from the 5th min to the 80th min of the run, followed by an increase to 60% and then to 90% till 115th min. Solvent B is maintained at 90% for the last 5 min (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]; Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nM.S. parameters and data acquisition\nKeep the peptide samples obtained from the in-solution digestion of the swab protein pool (i.e., Ethanol, Acetone, and Isopropanol) in the nano-LC autosampler maintained at 8°C and analyze the sample by using LC-MS setup as per parameters mentioned in Table S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1442-Mmc1.pdf].",

However, the individual samples in each cohort were considered as biological replicates. Samples were randomly run for discovery analysis and for targeted verification study. Blanks were run after each sample to ensure that there was no carryover from one sample to another.\nDay 3: MaxQuant analysis of swab samples Save the mass spectrometric raw files (.raw) generated after mass spectrometry in a folder named DD-MM-YY format for the protein identification by MaxQuant coupled with the Andromeda search engine.\nMaxQuant analysis\nAnalyze the raw datasets by using MaxQuant (v1.6.6.0) (Tyanova et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]) with the Human SwissProt and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) SwissProt database and perform the downstream analysis as described in the quantification and statistical analysis section. Readers are also encouraged to follow the latest software guidelines from MaxQuant (https://maxquant.org/[href=https://maxquant.org/]) (Tyanova et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]).\nNote: Reader can go through the given link for detailed workflow for MaxQuant analysis (http://coxdocs.org/doku.php?id=maxquant:manual:beginner[href=http://coxdocs.org/doku.php?id=maxquant:manual:beginner]) and for training purposes, user can visit YouTube Videos available from MaxQuant (https://maxquant.org/summer_school/[href=https://maxquant.org/summer_school/]).\nCritical: For this study, we used the Human and SARS-CoV-2 SwissProt database, which contains more than 20,300 and 13 proteins, respectively (Bankar et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). Users can parallelly use other search engines like MASCOT, Sequest HT, MS Amanda (Dorfer et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]) integrated into Proteome Discoverer (Orsburn, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]), Sequest, Mascot and Comet integrated into Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP) (Deutsch et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) etc.",
    "In MaxQuant, use Label-Free-Quantification (LFQ) parameters and set the label-type setting as \"standard\" with a multiplicity of 1. Keep maximum missing cleavage of 2 for both human and COVID-19 analysis, Carbamido-methylation at Cysteine (+57.021464 Da) as the fixed modification and oxidation at Methionine (+15.994915 Da) as the variable modification (Table S3[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1442-Mmc1.pdf]).\nSet the False-Discovery-Rate (FDR) to 1% to ensure high protein and peptide detection reliability.\nSet the decoy mode to \"revert\" and the type of identified peptide to \"unique+razor\".\nCritical: All the parameters/settings used for the MaxQuant analysis (v1.6.6.0) are described in the mqpar.xml file in the given link \"PRIDE: PXD020580’’and \"PRIDE: PXD023016\" Link: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD023016[href=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD023016] https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD020580[href=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD020580].\nDay 3: Label-free quantification and statistical analysis In this step, downstream analysis is done on the MaxQuant output data by using Microsoft Excel, R (Version 4.0.2), Python (Version 3.7.6), Metaboanalyst (Xia et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]) and Hierarchical Clustering Explorer (Version 3.0) (Seo and Shneiderman, 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]). For visualization and generation of different figures, Metaboanalyst and R are used. The detailed workflow of analysis is mentioned in the following section.\nQuantification and statistical analysis\nIn this step, use the MaxQuant analyzed proteins output file for statistical analysis. MaxQuant output files are in the txt folder, present inside the combined folder and the output file is in .txt format. Open the proteingroups.txt file in an excel sheet and remove the contaminants, Rev_proteins (Revere Decoy database) and proteins with a q-value greater than 0.05.\nTo understand the quality of the datasets, investigate the chromatogram of the samples and correlation coefficient (Spearman Rank Correlation) between the samples by using Metaboanalyst software (Xia et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]). Reader can go through the given link for detailed tutorials and guidelines (https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/docs/Tutorials.xhtml[href=https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/docs/Tutorials.xhtml]).",
    "Critical: This step is very crucial before going for the statistical analysis. Few samples having poor chromatograms and quality issues can be excluded for downstream analysis. For day-to-day variability and reproducibility of the instrument, user can run all human sample pools and BSA for quality control and observe the correlation coefficient between the sample pools and individual pools as described in Bankar et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2].\nNow transform the data into Log2 value and calculate the fold change by comparing the median intensities of the two sample groups and perform the Welch's t-test using Microsoft excel.\nNote: In this study, no missing value imputation is done to avoid any discrepancy in the data. Also, the datasets do not require normalization because a Gaussian distribution of features across the samples was observed, as represented in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]. All human sample pools, used to observe the sample-to-sample variation, also show very minimal difference (as shown in Bankar et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nCritical: In each sample dataset, different parameters are needed to be examined, such as the correlation coefficient across the samples, number of features identified in each sample, distribution pattern, etc., to understand the dataset more thoroughly. Also, normalization of the dataset is required if the dataset is not showing the Gaussian distribution and the user can choose a suitable strategy for data normalization. Reader can find all detected peptides in Table S4[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1442-Mmc2.xlsx] (Mendeley DOI: https://doi.org/10.17632/ykx6jrpsm3.1[href=https://doi.org/10.17632/ykx6jrpsm3.1]), that contains the details of peptides.\nPerform the principal component analysis, partial least square-discriminant analysis and select the proteins based on the variable importance in projection (VIP) score using Metaboanalyst software (https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/docs/Tutorials.xhtml[href=https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/docs/Tutorials.xhtml]).\nCalculate the significance level of the proteins based on the t-test independent samples with Bonferroni correction and use the Log2 transformed data for the violin plot.",
    "Note: In this study (Bankar et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]), proteins passing the t-test and having the p-value less than 0.05 were considered as significant (p-value annotation legend: ns: 5.00e-02 < p <= 1.00e+00; ∗: 1.00e-02 < p <= 5.00e-02; ∗∗: 1.00e-03 < p <= 1.00e-02; ∗∗∗: 1.00e-04 < p <= 1.00e-03; ∗∗∗∗: p <= 1.00e-04).\nPlot the heatmap by using Metaboanalyst. Set the Distance Measure parameter to Euclidean and clustering algorithm to Ward clustering.\nNote: In this study, all the statistical data analyses are completed using Microsoft Excel, R (Version 4.0.2), Python (Version 3.7.6), Metaboanalyst (Xia et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]), and Hierarchical Clustering Explorer (Version 3.0). Metaboanalyst is an easily accessible software and it provides different statistical analysis features for different types of data apart from metabolomics.\nDay 3: Pathway and Network Analysis In this step, all the significant proteins are used for the pathway and network analysis.\nTake the protein list, including those which are passing the fold change criteria and having a p-value less than 0.05.\nFor G.O. enrichment analysis (Zhou et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26])\nGo to the Metascape (https://metascape.org[href=https://metascape.org]) site\nUpload the proteins list\nSelect the input and analysis species\nClick on Express Analysis and it will generate the analysis report.

The study's verification phase tries to corroborate the differential abundances of selected proteins between experimental conditions, such as disease and control groups or severe versus non severe conditions.\nDay 4: Selection of MRM targets and instrument optimization\nSelection of MRM targets\nChoose targets for the MRM experiment based on some hypothesis from your discovery dataset or already available datasets from literature (MacLean et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]) (MacLean et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]).\nNote: The first step in verification investigations is selecting and prioritizing candidate proteins because validating every differentially expressed protein is difficult. There are no hard and fast rules for the initial selection of candidates. However, these candidates are often selected based on fold change and statistical significance. Other strategies can also be employed for target selection, such as top hits obtained based on functional enrichment analysis, machine learning approach or comparative analysis with published literature.",
    "Check for the initial response of the selected peptides in pooled samples to ensure if the target can be detected or not.\nAlways take replicate measurements in any quantitative study.\nNote: Replicates help to determine the precision with which a particular analyte can be quantified. These replicate measurements can be used to determine an estimate of the coefficient of variation (CV), which further define the repeatability and reproducibility of the experiment.\nSpike-in any SIL peptide (sequence-unique from the targets already present) into the samples in equal concentrations.\nNote: This works really well when there are limitations to the sample amount present, as in the current study. Such an exogenously spiked analyte/peptide can be used to determine the coefficient of variation. The CV can be calculated with the peak area values of these spiked-in peptides in all the samples of a set, using the formula below:\nCV= Standard deviation in Peak areas of SIL peptide/mean of the peak areas",
    "Critical: There can be two aims to use the MRM technique. Firstly is qualitative verification of the shotgun data to estimate the extent of dysregulation of proteins of interest. Secondly, to develop a robust assay that has been rigorously tested and satisfies specific regulations so that it can be used in routine clinical applications. In the current study, we have used the MRM technique for a qualitative verification of the shotgun results only. MRM assay that can be used for clinical applications needs to be first rigorously optimized in terms of response, selectivity, accuracy, precision and stability of the selected targets for the assay. Once basic parameters like repeatability and reproducibility are established, further parameters can be assessed. The response of this target peptide should not be affected by interference from the sample matrix. For this, an SIL peptide with the same sequence (as that of the peptide in question) should be spiked into the sample and response to be compared with the endogenous peptide. For absolute quantification, the LOD and LOQ of this peptide should be determined. It is also advised to check the stability of this peptide in different storage conditions and several biological replicates.\nViral targets- Select peptides unique to the SARS-CoV-2 proteome\nMake a list of SARS-CoV-2 peptides based on the discovery phase of your experiments from RT-PCR positive samples. Check their uniqueness to SARS-CoV-2 by using BLASTp.\nDownload the full SARS-CoV-2 proteome in FASTA format and keep it ready.\nHost Targets\nMake a list of the Uniprot IDs of all relevant proteins.\nNote: Interesting proteins that show dysregulation between COVID-19 positive vs negative samples or COVID-19 severe vs non-severe samples should be chosen.

Next, add the FASTA files (from step 7 b. and c.) and click OK. (The .protdb file will be created in the selected folder and automatically added to the current Skyline document).\nNote: This process takes some time, depending on the number of proteins present in your FASTA file.\nDay 4: Inserting targets and preparation of a transition list A transition list contains all the information about the targets that is understandable by the instrument. A transition is usually a pair of the m/z filters in Q1 and Q3 of a triple quadrupole required to detect a specific fragment properly.\nOpen a new Skyline document and go to Settings→ Peptide settings→ Digestion.

    "Note: The heavy transitions are added by clicking on Peptide settings→ Modifications tab. Isotope label type should be \"heavy\" and appropriate C-term heavy label modifications need to be selected here. It is better to refine transitions for the heavy labeled peptide in a separate experiment and add those transitions in the current document.\nExport the transition list by clicking on File→ Export→ Transition list. In the dialogue box, fill in as given below and click OK (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nNote: There is a limitation to the number of transitions that can be monitored in a single method or list depending on the instrument capabilities. For a TSQ Altis, usually, 450–500 transitions can be taken in an unscheduled method. If the total number of transitions in your Skyline document is more than this limit, ensure that you export them as \"Multiple methods\".\nAnother dialog box pops up as shown.

This file will be used to view and analyze the acquired results.\nNote: If the sample amount is limited and the number of transitions for selected targets are too high so pools can be used. Equal parts of samples belonging to a specific subgroup are pooled together and run as representatives for that group. Pools can be run to optimize unrefined transition lists.",
    "In this study, we monitored few viral peptides belonging to Replicase 1ab (ELLQNGMNGR), Nucleocapsid (DGIIWVATEGALNTPK) and Spike proteins (NTQEVFAQVK), respectively (Bankar et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). Since one could detect both viral and human proteins from swab samples, the transition list might have human proteins too. In such a case, SRMAtlas (http://www.srmatlas.org/[href=http://www.srmatlas.org/]) can also be helpful in this situation (for Human targets). Many human proteins are huge and have a large number of unique peptides. They can be narrowed down using SRMAtlas that gives the most frequently and consistently observed unique peptides for a protein in SRM experiments all around the world. In this study,in addition to viral peptides, the abundance change of a few host proteins was also verified using the MRM approach. If one aims to monitor and quantify a low-concentration analyte (peptide) in a sample targeted proteomics, stable isotope labeled (SIL) spike-in peptides (of the same sequence as that of target analyte) can be utilized for achieving the quantification. Firstly, serial dilutions of heavy SIL spike-in peptide samples can be run to determine a concentration at which a sufficient signal is obtained for the SIL spike-in peptide. This is followed by a spike-in of an equal amount of both heavy and light SIL peptides into the sample. The signal intensity of heavy and light peptides should give the same intensity if there is no endogenous peptide in the sample. In this way, the amount of endogenous peptide can then be quantified by monitoring the difference between the intensity of heavy and light peptide.\nDay 4: Preparation of the method file using transition list on QQQ mass spectrometer\nUnder Scan parameters of QQQ, go to import option.\nBrowse to the folder where the transition list was saved and select the list (e.g., SRM_final.csv).",
    "The selected list should have several columns, as shown in the table below.\nAfter importing the list, go to file→save as option to save the prepared method (e.g., SRM_final.method). Refer Table S7[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1442-Mmc1.pdf] for a representative illustration of transition list.\nDay 4: Setting up the acquisition queue on the QQQ mass spectrometer\nSetting up the acquisition queue on the QQQ mass spectrometer\nSample type: Select the sample type as unknown, blank or Q.C.\nCritical: Q.C. samples are standard samples. Often peptides from a pure protein (e.g., BSA in this case) are used as a measure for the day-wise instrument reproducibility. Q.C. samples are injected at least once a day. The concentration to be injected and transitions to be monitored are standardized by each lab and reproducibility is measured in teams of the uniformness in peak areas of the response.\nFilename: Customized file name can be given to annotate the data file.\nPath: It is the location of the drive or folder where the acquired data has to be saved.\nInstrument Method: Here, the method is browsed and selected from the folder where it was saved (This is the same method file that had been created using the transition list, e.g., SRM_final.method)\nPosition: It represents the position of the sample in the autosampler (e.g., G: A1 is the A1 position in the Green tray).\nInjection Volume: It tells the volume of injection specified for a run.\nFor all the samples, the same is repeated.\nOnce the acquisition queue is complete, save it in a particular folder and start the run by clicking on the run sample icon (if only a single sample has to be run) or run sequence icon (for multiple samples run).\nNote: While the acquisition queue is running, the row for the running sample cannot be edited.",
    "Import and overview of acquired data in Skyline\nOpen the same Skyline document which was used for exporting the transition list.\nGo to File → Import → Results\nBrowse to the folder where acquired data is saved. Select the raw files and open them.\nObserve the peaks in which the x-axis represents the retention time and the y-axis represents the intensity.\nAnnotate the peak area considering the coelution of all peptide transitions (library can be used to identify the correct peak).\nNote: Check if all the peaks are properly annotated by the software; else, annotate each peak manually by dragging the cursor and selecting the peak.\nTo view the spectra for all the samples at once for a particular peptide, go to View → Arrange graphs → Tiled.\nFor getting the stacked bar plot for the peak area of all the samples (replicates), go to View → Peak area → Replicate comparison.\nRefine the unrefined data by selecting the peptides which show consistent results across the samples. Delete the peptides or transitions which are not up to the mark.\nPerform statistical analysis as in the following steps.",
    "Note: Before moving to the next step, it should be ensured that the obtained results have sufficient data points for each spectral peak. An optimal number of data points is required for quantitative analysis, which is usually preferred as 10–15. If there are very few data points, such as only 3, the peak shape will be sharp and distorted, while the peak would be noisy with too many data points. This can be optimized by taking care of cycle time and dwell time. Dwell time is the amount of time for monitoring one transition and cycle time represents the total time for monitoring all the transitions once (one cycle). So, for getting 10 data points, the same cycle should repeat 10 times in the given window (peak width). The cycle time or dwell time can be finalized during optimization based on the peak width and number of data points required. Suppose there are 300 transitions to be monitored and we set the dwell time as 5 ms (milliseconds), then cycle time would be 1.5 s (300∗5). With these settings, if the peak width is 20 s, we may get 13 data points (20/1.5). In this study, the cycle time was set as 2 s.\nDay 5: Statistical analysis in Skyline This section shows the steps for comparing the data obtained across the groups.\nDocument settings options\nGo to Settings → Document settings → Annotations → Add.
