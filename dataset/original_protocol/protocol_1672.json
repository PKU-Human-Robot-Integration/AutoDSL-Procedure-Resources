    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nDissection\nTiming: 2 h\nPick the newly emerged long- and short-winged brown planthoppers, nymph undergoing the last molting and emerged. Make sure the brown planthoper is emerged in less than 5 min.\nPlace the insects in a Petri dish containing cold PBS. Under the stereoscope, use one tweezer to press against the abdomen of the brown planthopper, and the other removes wings and places them in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube containing 200 μL PBS (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], Method Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/123-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Remove Wings from Newly Emerged Brown Planthopper\nNote: A pair of wings from one brown planthopper was put into a tube as one sample.\nCritical: keep the samples on ice. The processing time of this step should not be too long to prevent cell necrosis.\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nMethod Video S1 Removing of Wings from a Brown Planthopper Using Tweezers (Refers to Step 2 in Dissection)\nPre-treatment\nTiming: 4 h\nTissue/cell separation: grind the prepared sample with a grinding pestle.\nCritical: Use a new grinding pestle for each sample. Do not reuse the pestle to grind the sample to prevent contamination. Samples should be ground sufficiently. The sample should be ground for at least 10 s. Insufficient grinding affects the collection of cells when the sample is loaded onto the machine.\nCell sedimentation: place the ground sample in a refrigerated centrifuge for centrifugation (10,000 × g, 4°C, 3 min).\nCell fixation:\nDiscard the supernatant.\nAdd 200 μL, 70% ethanol drop by drop (stored at −20°C).\nPlace the sample on ice and fix for 1 h to ensure that the basic morphology of the cells does not change.\nCell sedimentation: Put the fixed sample into a refrigerated centrifuge and centrifuge for 3 min (10,000 × g, 4°C).",
    "Permeabilization step:\nDiscard the supernatant.\nAdd 200 μL of PBS and 100 μL of 0.25% TritonX-100 respectively and mix well.\nLeave it at 4°C for 10 min.\nNote: A channel is formed in the surface of the cell to facilitate the subsequent entry of DAPI.\nCell sedimentation: put the sample into a refrigerated centrifuge and centrifuge for 3 min (10,000 × g, 4°C).\nNucleic acid staining:\nDiscard the supernatant.\nAdd 400 μL PBS and 2 μL DAPI fluorescent dye (excitation wavelength: 405 nm). (Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting])\nNote: DAPI binds strongly to DNA and emits fluorescence.\nObserve under a fluorescence microscope after 30 min in the dark. Then load the samples, the liquid ratio can be adjusted according to the number of samples.\nCell Cycle Detection\nTiming: 3 h\nBefore loading the samples, filter the sample with a 40 μm cell strainer.\nNote: Prevent the sample from blocking the lines of the instrument. (Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting])\nReady to use:\nCheck the sheath liquid barrel and waste liquid barrel to ensure that the liquid in both reservoirs is within the safe range.\nTurn on the flow cytometer and open the software.\nStart the flow cytometry process, use 2 mL of pure water to clean and preheat.\nName the sample, double-click the left button to set the channel used for the sample to PB450 (detection filter: 450 ± 45 nm), and select the appropriate channel according to the dyes used.\nSet two dot plots (FSC-A, SSC-A), (PB450-A, PB450-H) and one bar graph (PB450-A, COUNT). Change the format of the graph to linear.\nSet the first scatter plot FSC-A/SSC-A to circle the cell population;",
    "Doublet discrimination should be performed. Set up a second scatter plot of PB450 height signal and area signal to remove doublets, and the cell population with the same area signal and height signal is a single cell population;\nFinally, the PB450 histogram is used to analyze the cycle status of the single cell population.\nSample loading, the number of collected particles is uniformly set at 3,000, which can be adjusted according to the number of effective particles. Save the data after the sample loading, and finally perform cleaning to end the program. (Troubleshooting 3, 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/123-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Representative Dot Plots Image of Cells from the Long and Short Wings and Flow Cytometry Analysis Histograms of Cell Cycle Phases\nUpper: dot plots image of cells from the long and short wings and single cells were framed out; Lower: histograms shows the percentage each cell cycle phase of cells from the long and short wings.\nCell Cycle Analysis\nTiming: 2 h\nOpen the third-party software FlowJo and open the sample data in fcs format.\nIdentify valid cells:\nSet the first gate: (FSC-H, SSC-H) to delineate the cell population.\nNote: This step is to remove excessive cell debris.\nSet a second gate: (PB450-A, FSC-W) to delineate the single cell population.\nUsing “cell cycle” in “Tools” to quantify the percentage of G1, S, G2/M, and a histogram was added in FlowJo."
