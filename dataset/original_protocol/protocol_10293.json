    "The protocol outlined below is in line with the current ethics regulations of the authors’ institutions. In order to ensure this, important aspects of the design are: voluntary participation, the use of ordinary shopping tasks as experimental stimuli or instructions, and no collection of personal data. However, as ethics regulations can differ between institutions, please consult the local institution’s human research ethics committee before conducting any research.\n1. Experimental design and stimuli\nDefine the research question.\nSelect stimuli and task instructions based on the specific S studied in the 3S Model and the type of research question addressed.\n\t\nField studies: Consider relying on the shopping list procedure8,22,23, which ensures that customers will take approximately the same in-store path, since this increases the experimental control.\nConsider incentivizing participation (e.g., through lottery tickets) to facilitate a more rapid recruitment of subjects.\n2. Choice of eye-tracking equipment\nUse binocular, video-based, combined pupil/corneal reflection systems for the eye-tracking recordings.\n\t\nLab studies: Use a stationary system with a high sampling frequency (preferably 120 Hz or more).\nField studies: Use a head-mounted mobile system with a sampling frequency of at least 30 Hz.\n3. Data collection procedure\nRecruit participants with normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and preferably those not wearing heavy makeup around the eyes.\nUse cover stories or broad statements of the study objective so that participants remain naïve about the explicit scientific purpose until after the experiment has taken place.",
    "Ensure that participants have sufficient time for the task completion. As this can vary a lot between study designs (in general, field studies are more time consuming than lab studies), please time the procedure so that a good estimate during recruitment can be provided. Here, the video recording will take approximately 15 minutes per participant: 5 minutes for the calibration procedure and 10 minutes for data collection.\nGive participants the study-specific task instruction(s).\n\t\nLab studies: Ask participants to follow the on-screen instructions and expose them to the experimental stimuli on a projector screen.\nField studies: Ask participants to complete a predefined shopping task (e.g., the shopping list procedure), which naturally exposes them to a certain set of in-store stimuli.\nPlace the eye-tracking system around the participant’s head.\nStart the experimental session with a calibration procedure of the eye-tracking system. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for the calibration procedure.\nDistribute a predefined shopping list that is different between subjects. Here, olive oil and coffee are used as example products on the list.\n\t\nOlive oil is used as the first example product on the list. Instruct consumers to choose either an expensive or a cheap version of olive oil. This task corresponds to the Shelf level of the model.\nCoffee is used as the second and last example product on the list. Have consumers move to the coffee section of the store. Manipulate where the coffee products are located on the shelf to investigate whether a specific coffee package is more likely than another coffee package to be chosen when located at the same place in the shelf. This corresponds to the Stock level of the model.",
    "NOTE: Given that consumers will have to move and navigate throughout the store before reaching the first product and when walking between the first and the second product stated on the list, this corresponds to the Store level of our model.\nStart the eye-tracking recordings according to the manufacturer’s instruction.\nSend participants to complete their task.\nStop the eye-tracking recordings and debrief participants about the study purpose after completion of the experimental task(s).\n4. Data processing\nDefine areas of interest (AOIs) based on the study-specific research question.\nSelect the eye-tracking metric(s) that will constitute the unit of analysis.\n\t\nLab studies: Create AOIs by outlining areas of the stimuli that will be the basis for automatic categorization of the eye-tracking data.\nField studies: Manually categorize eye-tracking data into appropriate AOIs.\nExport the data containing AOIs and the corresponding eye-tracking metric(s) into a suitable statistical program.\nAnalyze the eye-tracking data with a statistical method that corresponds to the specific study purpose or hypothesis tested."
