This protocol utilizes a fluorophore for selection purposes. Any reference to antibiotics refers to the antibiotics typically included in cell culture media (i.e., Penicillin/Streptomycin) and not antibiotics used for selection. This protocol was optimized for the Kasumi-1 cell line; spin times and speeds should be adjusted for your cell line. We used the Neon electroporation system, and the Thermo Fisher website contains useful hints for optimization (https://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/neon_device_man.pdf[href=https://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/neon_device_man.pdf])\nOptimization 1\nWarm E2 buffer, R buffer, and culture medium without antibiotics to 37°C.\nPrepare a 24-well plate with 1 mL of culture medium without antibiotics per well to transfer electroporated cells to. Place plate in incubator to allow media to equilibrate.\nCount cells and aliquot 30 million cells to a 50 mL conical tube.\nSpin down for 5 min at 100 × g ∼20°C.\nWash cells twice with 50 mL ∼20°C PBS.\nLoad a Neon tube with 3 mL of 37°C E2 buffer into the Neon Pipette Station.\nResuspend cells in 3 mL of 37°C R buffer.\nCritical: Do not store the cell suspension in R buffer for more than 30 mins, because this can reduce cell viability and transfection efficiency.\nAdd 60 μg of plasmid expressing a fluorescent protein marker (e.g., GFP) and mix well.\nSelect the optimization option on the Neon and load the optimization protocols. See the Neon website for a chart of the optimization parameters.\nSlowly load the 100 μL Neon tip with the resuspended cell/plasmid mixture. Make sure there are no air bubbles in the tip before proceeding.\nInsert the Neon Pipette into the Neon Pipette Station.",
    "Select the first protocol in the optimization window and press start to electroporate cells.\nAfter electroporation, immediately transfer cells to the 24-well plate with pre-warmed (37°C) culture medium.\nRepeat steps 9–12 for the remaining optimization protocols.\nGently shake plate to evenly distribute cells.\nIncubate plate in a humidified CO2 incubator at 37°C for 24–48 h.\nAssess cell viability:\nMix 10 μL Trypan Blue with 10 μL well mixed cell culture.\nLoad 10 μL of the mixture onto a hemocytometer.\nCount the number of cells.\nCalculate the percentage of viability (Live Cells/ Total Cells)\nAssess transfection efficiency:\nSpin down remaining cells in a micro centrifuge tube.\nWash once in 500 μL TC-PBS.\nResuspend in 400 μL 0.5% BSA in PBS.\nFlow for fluorescent marker.\nOptimization 2 (optional)\nBased on the best electroporation conditions from Optimization 1, perform optimization with narrower parameters.\nCRISPR/Cas9 electroporation\nTiming: [1.5 h]\nThis step will deliver the CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes and template DNA to the cells via electroporation. This protocol utilizes fluorophores for selection purposes. Any reference to antibiotics refers to the antibiotics typically included in cell culture media (i.e., Penicillin/Streptomycin) and not antibiotics used for selection.\nIn a micro centrifuge tube mix:\n3 μL crRNA (100 μM)\n3 μL tracrRNA (100 μM)\n4 μL of R buffer\nHeat at 95°C for 5 min and let cool to ∼25°C (10–15 min at bench).\nPrepare RNP Complex by adding 1.5 μL of Cas9 nuclease (10 mg/mL) to cooled gRNA complex.\nIncubate at ∼20°C for 25–30 min to form the RNP complex.\nUse this incubation time to warm Buffer E2 and Buffer R to 37°C, set up the Neon Transfection System, and begin preparing cells for electroporation.\nAliquot 1.25 ×106 cells per reaction to 15 mL conical tube.\nSpin down at 100 × g at ∼20°C.",
    "Wash twice with ∼20°C PBS.\nAdd 3 mL of 37°C E2 buffer to the Neon tube.\nSet the electroporation parameters:\nKasumi-1: 1300 V, 30 ms, 1 pulse\nResuspend cells in 105 μL 37°C R buffer per 1.25 ×106 cells (avoid making air bubbles when pipetting up and down.)\nCritical: Do not store the cell suspension in R buffer for more than 30 min because this can reduce cell viability and transfection efficiency.\nAdd 3 mL of 37°C media without antibiotics per reaction to a 6 well plate.\nAdd 12 μg of the HDR plasmid to tube.\nNote: If multiple plasmids are being used to introduce different fluorophores an equal amount of each plasmid should be added to total 12 μg.\nAliquot 105 μL of cells to each of the tubes and gently pipette up and down to mix.\nUsing 100 μL Neon tip, draw up the cell/plasmid/RNP mixture\nInsert the pipette tip directly into the E2 buffer in the plastic cuvette. Do not touch the walls.\nPress start.\nAfter the protocol is complete, remove the pipette and dispense contents into a well with pre-warmed (37°C), equilibrated media without antibiotics.\nIncubate in a humidified CO2 incubator at 37°C for 24 h, then check viability and replace the media with culture media + penicillin and streptomycin.\nExpand cells for FACS.\nFluorescence-activated cell sorting\nTiming: [1–2 weeks]",
    "The incorporation of fluorescent proteins into the cassette for homology directed repair allows for selection of positive cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Fluorophore positive cells are readily detectable 4 days post-electroporation, with maximal positivity observed by 7 days post-electroporation. If possible, it is recommended to assess editing efficiency by flow cytometry in advance to determine how many cells will need to be sorted. Electroporation can damage cells which may result in increased auto fluorescence while the cells are recovering. Using a viability dye, such as Zombie-NIR, may be beneficial to reduce auto-fluorescence associated with dying cells. Depending on the efficiency of the editing, it may take a few weeks for cells to recover and expand to the point where they can be used for subsequent experiments.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/648-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting of edited cells\nRepresentative flow cytometry plots of mCherry and BFP expression from endogenous AML1-ETO locus after integration of donor DNA. Note: AML1-ETO is monoallelic and the remaining ETO allele is not expressed, the double positive population is a result of auto fluorescence after electroporation.\nCount cells.\nSpin down cells at 100 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nOptional: Zombie Viability Stain\nResuspend cells in 100 μL 1:2000 Zombie NIR in PBS per million cells\nIncubate for 15 min at 4°C in the dark.\nSpin at 100 × g for 5 min at 4°C\nResuspend in 1 mL of 0.5% BSA in PBS per 10 million cells\nTransfer to strainer capped flow tube.\nSwap strainer cap for standard cap.\nSort.\nNote: Cells positive for only one fluorophore can also be sorted and saved for use as compensation controls for later flow cytometry experiments.\nSpin down cells at 100 × g for 5 min @ 4°C.\nDilute sorted cells to 0.5×106 cells/mL in culture media.",
    "Incubate in a humidified CO2 incubator at 37°C. Expand sorted cells until you have enough to freeze down.\nCritical: Following expansion of the cells post-sort, cells should be reanalyzed for fluorophore expression. If the sorted cell population is less than 95% positive for fluorophore expression (95% of the cells should be positive for both fluorophores if targeting both alleles), a second sort is recommended. In these cases, it is important to be very conservative with gating. For example, sorting only the brightest 30% of fluorophore positive cells.\nWestern blot to establish the degradation time course\nTiming: [2–3 days]\nThe PROTAC, dTAG-47, is a heterobifunctional molecule consisting of a thalidomide derivative and a FKBP12F36V selective ligand that is connected by a linker. Thus, treatment with dTAG-47 results in the selective recruitment of the FKBP12F36V degron tagged protein to CRBN to facilitate proteasome-mediated degradation (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A) (Nabet et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; Weintraub et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]). dTAG-47 is not yet commercially available; however, the structure and synthesis protocol have been published elsewhere (Weintraub et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]). The related, but less potent, dTAG-13 small molecule is chemically similar to dTAG-47 (Nabet et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]) and is commercially available.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/648-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Establishing the degradation time course\n(A) Schematic of the dTAG system showing how the FKBP12F36V tag directs the chimeric protein to the proteosome.\n(B) Western blot analysis of whole-cell lysates from Kasumi-1 AML1-ETO-FKBP12F36V-2xHA cells treated with dTAG-47 for 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 6, and 24 h. AML1-ETO- FKBP12F36V-2xHA was rapidly degraded after addition of dTAG-47. GAPDH served as a loading control. A titration of the untreated (0 h) lysate was included for comparison.",
    "The kinetics of protein degradation are highly dependent on the protein target and cell line. Some proteins are completely degraded within 30 min of dTAG-47 addition, while other proteins take up to 6 h for full degradation. This protocol uses dTAG-47 at a final concentration of 500 nM. However, the optimal concentration of dTAG-47 should be determined for each cell line and protein target, as too little dTAG molecule may result in incomplete degradation, while too much can be associated with the “hook effect” and also limit optimal degradation (Pettersson and Crews, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nOnce sorted, western blot analysis is used to confirm that the correct alleles were tagged, the protein produced is tagged, and to determine if tag incorporation compromised protein stability. Incorporation of the FKBP12F36V-2xHA-P2A-mCherry cassette adds ∼13 kD to your protein resulting in slower migration on a gel than the untagged protein. A time course of 0, 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h is recommended to identify 2–3 time points for nascent RNA transcription analysis. A serial dilution (e.g., 10%, 20%, 50%) of the 0 h lysate should be included to determine the lower detection limit of the antibody and approximate protein levels after dTAG-47 treatment (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nHarvest 14 ×106 tagged cells (2 ×106 per time point).\nDilute to 4×105 cells per mL in culture media.\nAliquot 5 mL of diluted cells to 7 T25 flasks.\nAdd 5 μL of 500 μM dTAG-47 (final concentration 500 nm) to the flasks 24 h, 8 h, 4 h, 2 h, 1 h and 30 min before harvesting the protein for western blot analysis (do not treat the 0 h control).",
    "Note: We recommend blotting for both HA (Abcam, 1:1000) and the endogenous protein to ensure that the majority of the protein is tagged as well as to compare expression levels of the endogenous and tagged proteins.\nTemporal analysis of transcriptional changes\nTiming: [1–7 days]\nMechanistic studies of transcriptional regulators have been complicated by a lack of experimental approaches and reagents that can assay changes in transcription before compensatory or secondary changes in gene expression take effect. Incorporation of the FKBP12F36V tag removes several barriers to defining the direct effects resulting from the loss of a transcriptional regulator. Rapid degradation of endogenous proteins allows for transcriptional analysis immediately after loss of the protein, which circumvents issues with traditional methodologies such as compensation or changes in cell phenotype (e.g., differentiation, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis). Furthermore, the inclusion of the HA epitope tag eliminates the need for a high-quality antibody to the endogenous protein for genome-wide localization analysis such as ChIP-seq or CUT&RUN. Below we describe the ideal set of experiments to define transcriptional targets and interrogate mechanisms of transcriptional control. Detailed protocols for the techniques used have been published elsewhere, and any adjustments made to publicly available protocols are described here.\nNote: All sequencing experiments should be performed in biological duplicate.\nCritical: For all time courses discussed here, the endpoint is considered to be when the cells are first harvested. Therefore, it is very important to process samples as quickly as possible.",
    "Critical: Method of normalization should be considered while planning an experiment. Spike-in controls are essential for experiments in which you expect global changes in the factor you are measuring. We use nuclei (prepared in house) from the Drosophila melanogaster cell line, Schneider 2 (S2), as spike-in controls for PRO-seq and ChIP-seq experiments and fragmented DNA from Escherichia coli (available from EpiCypher) for CUT&RUN experiments. If you are expecting a small number of changes, normalization may be calculated by using algorithms such as DESeq2 or possibly based on read counts for each experimental condition (e.g., reads per million).\nPRO-seq\nPrecision nuclear run-on transcription coupled with deep sequencing (PRO-seq) (Mahat et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]) was selected to measure changes in nascent transcription over the first 6 h of the degradation time course. PRO-seq was selected because it generates strand-specific maps of transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerases, which can be analyzed to identify changes in gene body transcription as well as changes in promoter-proximal pausing, elongation rates, and eRNA production. Therefore, PRO-seq provides a deep understanding of the mechanisms by which a given protein contributes to transcriptional control. In our initial experiment, PRO-seq was performed at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 6 h after addition of dTAG-47. These time points were selected based on western blot analysis of AML1-ETO degradation (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). We recommend choosing at least two to three of the earliest time points at which the protein is maximally degraded. We do not recommend performing longer PRO-seq time courses for the purpose of identifying direct transcriptional targets, as indirect transcriptional effects will occur if your factor regulates other transcription factors or epigenomic modifiers.\nRNA-seq",
    "While PRO-seq measures changes in nascent transcription rates, RNA-seq measures changes in the cytoplasmic pools of mRNA. There are a number of mechanisms that regulate the processing of nascent transcripts into translatable mRNA. We recommend performing an RNA-seq time course after degradation of your protein target to ensure that transcriptional targets identified by changes in nascent transcription contribute to biologically meaningful changes in mRNA levels. It takes longer for changes in transcription to affect the cytoplasmic pools of mRNA, so a longer time course is needed (e.g., 0, 4, 8, and 24 h after dTAG-47 addition). A degradation time course paired with RNA-seq will still identify waves of gene expression changes but will lack the resolution to make meaningful mechanistic conclusions or separate direct and indirect targets.\nCUT&RUN/ChIP-seq",
    "Identification of DNA binding sites by ChIP-seq or CUT&RUN (Skene et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]) can further increase the confidence that identified targets are indeed directly regulated by the protein of interest. Most importantly, these datasets can be overlaid with genomic localization of histone marks, histone modifying proteins, or other transcriptional regulators to begin to dissect the mechanism by which the transcription factor of interest controls transcription. We suggest using CUT&RUN for most genomic localization experiments, because it requires fewer cells and less sequencing depth than ChIP-seq and can be performed without formaldehyde crosslinking. However, currently ChIP-seq remains the best technique for assessing H3K27ac levels throughout the genome. The time points selected for these experiments will depend on the purpose of the experiment. Experiments focused on identifying binding sites for your protein of interest do not require a thorough time course. For this type of experiment, we compare untreated samples to those treated at a time point where your protein is maximally degraded (i.e., 8 or 24 h after addition of dTAG-47). This system is ideal, because it allows the uses the same antibody in the experimental and control samples instead of IgG to identify non-specific binding of the antibody. Experiments focused on identifying mechanisms of transcriptional regulation (e.g., histone marks, histone modifying enzymes, or other transcriptional regulators) should be performed as an extensive time course with early time points matching your PRO-seq time points and extended to 24 h. Experiments using antibodies to targets other than the dTAGged protein should include an IgG control. The purpose of both the dTAG treated and IgG controls is to identify peaks that are not specific to the antibody used. These peaks can correspond to non-specific binding sites or areas of open chromatin that are hyperaccessible to the MNase.",
    "We recommend using the EpiCypher protocol (https://www.epicypher.com/content/documents/protocols/cutana-cut&run-protocol.pdf[href=https://www.epicypher.com/content/documents/protocols/cutana-cut%26run-protocol.pdf]), which is publicly available and routinely updated. This protocol is based off of the protocol published by Skene, Henikoff, and Henikoff in 2018, but it has been further optimized for reproducibility and is performed in PCR tubes which enables a more rapid workflow. We recommend including a secondary antibody incubation in all CUT&RUN experiments. After the primary antibody incubation (step 15 in EpiCypher CUT&RUN Protocol v1.6):\nPlace the tube on a magnet until slurry clears and pipet to remove supernatant.\nWhile beads are on the magnet, add 250 μL cold Digitonin Buffer directly onto beads of each sample, and then pipet to remove supernatant.\nRepeat previous step for total of two washes.\nAdd 50 μL cold Antibody Buffer to each tube\nAdd 1:200 secondary antibody and incubate for 1 h at 4°C.\nProceed with step 16 of EpiCypher CUT&RUN Protocol v1.6.\nAntibodies and incubation times that we have successfully used for CUT&RUN and ChIP-seq are listed in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1](supplier and catalog information can be found in the Key resources table).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_648_1.csv\nNote: For CUT&RUN time courses, we recommend including a light crosslinking (0.1% formaldehyde for 5 min.) to prevent additional changes during the overnight primary antibody incubation.\nData analysis\nA general workflow for analyzing genomic datasets is depicted in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]. There are a number of publicly available software packages available for each step. We have summarized the software packages we commonly use in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/648-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Analyzing genomic data\nA general workflow for processing the genomic data sets generated by this protocol. The software programs required to complete each step are listed in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_648_2.csv",
    "The table describes the software packages we use for each step of analyzing the genomic data sets generated by this protocol, the coding language required to run the software, the techniques each software package can be applied to, and citations for the manuals that describe these packages. (PRO-seq = PS, RNA-seq = RS, CUT&RUN = C&R, and ChIP-seq = ChIP)\nData interpretation: identifying direct transcriptional targets\nTo identify direct transcriptional targets, we intersect our PRO-seq and CUT&RUN data to identify genes that have changes in nascent transcription, that translate into similar changes in mRNA levels, and that are bound by the transcription factor of interest. This section describes how we identify direct transcriptional targets and can be applied to both genes and enhancers.\nPRO-seq: The 0 h control files should be compared to the files from each experimental time point individually when using NRSA. The pause_PROseq.pl command from NRSA performs a number of functions including calculating the differential expression of all expressed genes. The eRNA.pl command performs a similar function to identify intergenic eRNA. These commands generate tables containing differential expression data that are saved to files called gb_change.txt and Enhancer_change.txt, respectively, in the specified output directory (Wang et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]). These files can be loaded into R, Python, and Microsoft Excel for further analysis. We use the gb_change.txt and Enhancer_change.txt files for the following analysis:\nNote: The eRNA.pl command also generates an Enhancer_info.txt file which contains annotations to the closest gene as well as intersection with the FANTOM5 and 4DGenome datasets.\nIdentify significantly changed genes or eRNA (fold change > 1.5, padj <0.05, calculated by NRSA) for each time point.\nOverlap the significantly changed genes or eRNA from each time point (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/648-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Temporal analysis of transcriptional changes",
    "Genes identified as differentially expressed (fold change > 1.5, padj < 0.05, calculated by NRSA) in each PRO-seq time point were overlapped (A). Genes that are differentially expressed in at least 2 PRO-seq time points were compiled into a candidate gene set. The heat map (B) shows the log2(Fold Change) of the candidate gene set in each time point. Log2(Fold Change) was calculated by NRSA and the heat map was produced in R. The fragment depth around AML1-ETO CUT&RUN binding sites that are identified as differentially bound (fold change > 1.5, padj < 0.05, calculated by DiffBind) are shown in heat maps made with deepTools (C). Differentially bound sites were annotated with HOMER and overlapped with the 59 gene AML1-ETO repression signature to identify binding sites that correspond to transcriptional changes (D). This identified 270 peaks that correlated with transcriptional changes. The binding sites that were annotated to the AML1-ETO repression signature were overlapped with ChIP-seq/CUT&RUN data (+/- dTAG-47) for histone modifications associated with transcriptional activation, H3K27ac and H3K4me3 (E), and transcription factors RUNX1 and PU.1 (F) to identify mechanisms of transcriptional activation after degradation of AML1-ETO. Fragment depth was calculated using HOMER and graphs were produced in PRISM. We have determined that although multiple peaks may annotate to the same gene, many of these peaks are non-regulatory. For example four peaks are annotated to CBFA2T3 (G) but only the peaks at the promoter and at the intronic enhancer (blue arrows) show recruitment of RUNX1 and corresponding accumulation of H3K27ac following AML1-ETO degradation. Similarly multiple peaks were annotated to CEBPA (H) but only the distal enhancer (blue arrow) shows increased occupancy of RUNX1 and PU. 1 and subsequent accumulation of H3K27ac.

    "Gene body changes: Overlaps in gene body changes can be identified using R or Python to intersect the transcript IDs or gene names of the significantly changed genes identified in step 49.

Although multiple binding sites may annotate to the same gene, not all of these peaks are regulatory. Studying changes in histone modifications and the occupancy of other transcriptional regulators can help separate regulatory (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]G and 6H, marked by blue arrows) from non-regulatory peaks."
