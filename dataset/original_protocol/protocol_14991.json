    "NOTE: All animal procedures were approved by the Nationwide Children's Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Graft Manufacturing\nMake the ε-caprolactone and L-lactide copolymer P(LA/CL) solution by adding 100mg P(LA/CL) in 2 ml dioxane under a fume hood. Place the solution on a vortex and mix continuously for 1-1.5 hr to dissolve completely. \nIn the meantime, remove a sheet of polyglycolic acid (PGA) felt from the freezer and cut out several 5 x 8 mm sections. Also cut off the tip of a 0.1-10 µl pipette just above the filter.\nInsert a 19 G needle (1.5 length) into the distal end of a pipet tip and wrap the PGA felt around the needle using micro forceps.\nCarefully push the felt to the distal end of the pipet tip, where the lumen is straighter than the proximal part, using a blunt 18 G needle, while the 19 G needle is inserted into it.\nPipette 40 µl P(CL/LA) solution into the pipette tip from the top. Saturate the PGA felt with the solution. Then push air bubbles out using a pipette dispenser. Repeat this process if needed.\nPlace grafts in a 50 ml tube and place it in a -80 °C freezer for 20 min. Make sure the head of the needles face downward.\nTransfer the tube into a lyophilizer and vacuum for 24 hr. Make sure to open the lid of the tube to have airflow.\nTake out the grafts and remove them from the needles. Cut both ends of the graft leaving a ~5 mm section and put them back onto the needles to maintain their shape. Keep the grafts in a desiccator.\nPlace the scaffold under UV light in a biosafety hood O/N before cell seeding.\n2. Bone Marrow Mononuclear Cell Harvesting and Isolation",
    "Euthanize the mice with ketamine/xylazine overdose (ketamine, 200 mg/kg and xylazine, 20 mg/kg).\nRemove bones (femurs and tibias) from 3 mice for 10 graft implantations and place in a Petri dish with 10 cc RPMI. Cut both ends of the bones and flush bone marrow using a syringe with a 25 G needle into a new Petri dish with 3 cc RPMI. Collect bone marrow and RPMI solution in a 15 cc tube and wash the petri dish with additional 2 cc RPMI to collect the remainder of BM.\nTake sample (5-10 µl) and count cell using an automated cell counter or hemocytometer. Record the result.\nPut 5 cc Ficoll in a 15 cc centrifuge tube and add bone marrow and RPMI solution. Add the solution very gently to prevent it from mixing with Ficoll.\nCentrifuge at 528 x g for 30 min with \"NO BRAKE\" at 24 °C.\nRemove the upper pink layer. Collect the middle clear layer Figure 1, which is the MNC layer, and dilute it with PBS 1:1.\nCentrifuge the dilute MNC solution at 528 x g for 10 min at 24 °C.\nRemove the supernatant and dilute the pellet with 5 ml PBS.\nCentrifuge the pellet solution at 528 x g for 10 min at 24 °C.\nRemove the supernatant. Dilute the pellet with the appropriate volume of RPMI (~200 µl).\nTake a 5-10 µl sample and count cells using an automated cell counter or hemocytometer. Record the result. Repeat the cell counting one more time and calculate the average cell number.\nDilute cell concentration to 1,000,000 cells/10 µl using RPMI.\n3. Cell Seeding\nPrewet scaffold by adding 5 µl RPMI luminally for 5 min, then remove RPMI.",
    "Add 10 µl bone marrow derived mono nuclear cells in RPMI from Step 2.12 to scaffold lumen and wait for 10 min to allow cells to attach onto the scaffold.\nCut a 19 G needle to 1 cm length and put the needle into the lumen of the scaffold to keep the shape of the scaffold. Place the sample in a 24-well plate.\nAdd 1,000 µl RPMI to each well and incubate O/N in an incubator.\n4. Graft Implantation\nAutoclave all the surgical tools before the surgery: 1x fine scissors, 3x micro forceps, 2x micro vascular clamps, 1x clamp applying forceps, 1x micro needle holder, 1x spring scissors, 1x retractor.\n6-8 weeks old female C57BL/6 are used as tissue engineered vascular graft recipients. Remove the mouse from its cage and weigh it, then anesthetize through an intraperitoneal injection into the lower right quadrant of the abdomen with a ketamine/xylazine cocktail (ketamine, 100 mg/kg and xylazine, 10 mg/kg). Ketoprofen (5 mg/kg, IP) is used as a pre-anesthesia analgesic.\nCheck the level of sedation by tale pinching, then clip the abdominal hair. Lubricate the eyes with sterile ophthalmic ointment, and place the mouse in a dorsal recumbence position on a pad. Disinfect the abdomen with betadine and alcohol pads. Cover the mouse with a sterile drape and expose the incision area only.\nMake a midline laparotomy incision from below the xyphoid to the suprapubic region, and insert a self-retaining retractor. Wrap the intestines in saline moistened gauze. Bluntly define the infrarenal aorta and vena cava.\nPlace two micro vascular clamps on both proximal and distal sides of the aorta and vena cava then bluntly separate the aorta from the vena cava Transect the vena cava. If necessary, ligate the abdominal aortic branches with a 10-0 monofilament sutures on tapered needles.",
    "Implant an inferior vena cava interposition graft with proximal and distal end to end anastomoses using a sterile 10-0 suture. Trim the graft, usually 1-2 mm, dependent on the anatomy of the mouse. Secure the graft with one stitch on both proximal and distal ends and start to suture continuously with 4-5 stiches from the other side of the graft. After finishing the front side, flip the clamps and grafts to the other side and suture the back side of the graft. During implantation, flush the graft with heparin solution frequently to prevent acute thrombosis.\nRemove the proximal clamp and control the hemorrhage by applying a topical absorbable sterile hemostat agent. When the hemorrhage stops completely, remove the distal clamp and control the hemorrhage the same way. Make sure blood flows through the graft.\nClose the abdominal musculature and skin in two layers using a 6-0 black polyamide monofilament suture with included threaded needle.\nInject 0.5 ml saline subcutaneously and place the mouse in a recovery cage on a warming pad until the mouse is fully mobile. Upon recovery, return the mouse to a new cage with paper bedding. Give pain medication (Ibuprofen, 30 mg/kg, drinking water) for 48 hr.\nSubscription Required.
