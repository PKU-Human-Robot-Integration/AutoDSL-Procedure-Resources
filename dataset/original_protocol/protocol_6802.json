    "Design sgRNA primersDesign sgRNA spacers using any online tools, such as CRISPR-P (http://crispr.hzau.edu.cn/cgi-bin/CRISPR2/CRISPR[href=http://crispr.hzau.edu.cn/cgi-bin/CRISPR2/CRISPR]).Note: The transcription of sgRNAs is derived by OsU3 or OsU6 promoters, which have different transcription initiation sites (the first nucleotide of spacer). The transcription initiation site of OsU3 promoter is nucleotide A, while that of OsU6 promoter is nucleotide G. To construct binary vectors harboring one spacer starting with an ‘A’, add the following nucleotides to 3′ downstream of the sense (SS) and antisense (AS) sgRNA spacers to obtain sgRNA primers:SS: 5′-gttttagagctatgctgaaa-3′AS: 5′-tgccacggatcatctgcac-3′To construct binary vectors harboring one target starting with a ‘G’, add the following nucleotides to 3′ downstream of the sense (SS) and antisense (AS) sgRNA spacers to obtain sgRNA primers:SS: 5′-gttttagagctagaaatag-3′AS: 5′-ggcagccaagccagcaccc-3′To construct binary vectors harboring two targets, starting with an ‘A’ and a ‘G’, respectively:Add the following nucleotides to 5′ upstream of the sense of ‘A’-started sgRNAs (A-sgRNA-SS) and antisense of ‘G’-started sgRNAs (G-sgRNA-AS) to obtain sgRNA primers:A-sgRNA-SS: 5′-agGGTCTCAggca-3′G-sgRNA-AS: 5′-agGGTCTCAaaac-3′Add the following nucleotides to 3′ downstream of the sense of ‘A’-started sgRNAs (A-sgRNA-SS) and antisense of ‘G’-started sgRNAs (G-sgRNA-AS) oligonucleotides:A-sgRNA-SS: 5′-gttttagagctatgc-3′G-sgRNA-AS: 5′-ggcagccaagccagc-3′Order the primers from any qualified company.To construct binary vectors harboring one target, dilute the primers to a work concentration of 1 μM with sterilized double distilled H2O.To construct binary vectors harboring two targets, dilute the primers to a work concentration of 10 μM with sterilized double distilled H2O.Notes: When you are designing sgRNAs to binary vectors harboring two targets, it is important but unnecessary to exclude sgRNA sequences containing BsaI restriction sites. The concatenate function in WPS Excel is very useful in obtaining the correct sequences of sgRNA primers. For example, in order to obtain sgRNA forward primer in Excel, add spacer sequence in cell A1 and SS sequence in cell B1.",
