    "Fabrication of PDMS biochipsThe microfluidic biochips can be fabricated with PDMS (Sylgard 184 kit) casted from a master mould on a silicon wafer by photolithography (Qin et al., 2010). Most universities and institutes have photolithography and clean room facilities for the fabrication of the master mould. In this protocol, the photolithography is conducted at the Research and Prototype Foundry at University of Sydney Nano Institute[href=https://sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/research-and-prototype-foundry.html]. It is possible to perform photolithography without a foundry. The equipment required would include: 1. Air plasma system, 2. Oven for PDMS curing, 3. Desiccator for PDMS degassing, 4. Programmable spin coater, 5. UV lamp–LED exposure, 6. Programmable hot plate. We refer interested readers to: Microfluidic device design, fabrication, and testing protocols[href=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282622160_Microfluidic_device_design_fabrication_and_testing_protocols] or Elveflow[href=https://www.elveflow.com/softlithobox-pdms-and-su-8-full-soft-lithography-station/].Dehydrate a 4 in. silicon wafer at 200 °C for 20 min, then apply an adhesion promoter for 30 s at 120 °C.Spin coat the wafer with SU-8 2050 (high contrast, epoxy-based) photoresist using a spread cycle of 70 and 22 x g for 30 s and a development cycle of 1,000 and 0.5 x g for 30 s in order to achieve a desired film thickness in the z-axis (e.g., 50 μm in this protocol).Conduct a cycle of edge bead removal for 30 s using edge bead removal solvent.Directly write the pattern to the SU-8 film using a dose of 365 nm UV light at 100 mJ/cm2.Crosslink the film pattern by baking on a hotplate and ramping the temperature at 5 °C/min, starting at 23 °C and holding at 90 °C to dry out the solvents. The ramping profile is achieved by proximity, plus vacuum contact bake steps, for a total duration of 805 s.Allow the film to cool on the hotplate to room temperature. Note: Keep the film on the hotplate to avoid thermal stress.",
    "Develop unexposed SU-8 photoresist using fresh developer solution for 3.5 min in a rocker.Rinse the wafer with IPA. Dry the wafer using pressurized nitrogen. Hard-bake the wafer at 150 °C for 30 min. Note: Alternatively, follow the Permanent Epoxy Negative Photoresist Processing Guidline[href=http://microchem.com/pdf/SU-82000DataSheet2025thru2075Ver4.pdf.] from MicroChem.Note: The following Steps (A11-A17) can be performed in the research lab (these steps do not require a clean room). (Figure 1) Transfer the silicon wafer into a 150 mm Petri dish, SU-8 side facing upwards, and secure with scotch tape.Mix the Sylgard 184 kit PDMS base with the kit curing agent at a ratio of 10:1 by weight. For example, to prepare 198 g of PDMS, mix 180 g of the PDMS base with 18 g of the curing agent.Notes: Due to the viscosity of the base and curing agent, it is easier to prepare the kit by weight. It is important that the base and curing agent are mixed completely to prevent inconsistencies in the curing of the final product. Mix thoroughly until no visible streaks can be seen. This process will create a large amount of small bubbles that need to be removed by degassing. Once the curing agent is added to the PDMS base, the PDMS will slowly begin to cure and harden at room temperature. This will be noticeable after 4 h. After 16 h, the PDMS will become too viscous to practically work with. Pour the PDMS mixture over the pre-made mold, creating a 4-5 mm thick film.Place the PDMS and mold in a Nalgene® vacuum desiccator and degas for 30 min.Note: The amount of time required to degas the mixture is dependent on the volume and surface area of PDMS.",
    "The mixture must be degassed completely, otherwise bubbles will form during the curing process which will change the morphology of the device. For 200 g of PDMS placed in a 100 mm diameter Petri dish, 2 h is sufficient to completely degas the mixture. Bake (cure) the PDMS mixture and mold in the oven at 80 °C for 4 h.Cut out the cured PDMS chips from the mold gently and carefully.Notes: For the design used in this protocol, the biochip can be cut from the mold and the remaining PDMS can be left on the mold to reduce the amount of PDMS required for fabrication in the future. The typical PDMS cut-out block has a length of 4 cm, width of 2 cm and height of 5 mm. Avoid larger PDMS cut-outs as these can bend the coverslip and obscure the plane of focus during image acquisition. Take care not to damage or crack the mold whilst cutting out the biochip. Gradually cut out the PDMS by making consecutive, linear cuts into the PDMS and gently lift the PDMS off from the silicon wafer. With the channel side facing upward, use a 6 mm diameter biopsy punch to cut out a hole at one end of the channel. Punch another hole at the opposite end of the channel using a 1 mm diameter biopsy punch.Note: The 6 mm hole is used as a well to hold the sample for the microfluidics experiment once the biochip is placed on a coverslip. The 1 mm hole is used to connect the channel to the syringe pump.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190314/20190314010444_6689.jpgFigure 1. Fabrication of PDMS biochips.",
    "The PDMS biochip produced in this protocol features a 6 mm diameter inlet (well) which can hold up to 100 μl of sample, and a 1 mm diameter outlet which connects the channel to the pump. The channel has a length of 12 mm, width of 0.4 mm and a height of 0.05 mm (A, B, and C). The manufactured silicon wafer mask contains indentations which form the shape of the channel (D).Cleaning the biochipDust and other impurities can affect the coating of coverslips with fibrinogen and obstruct the field of view under the microscope. Dust may also interfere with the adhesion of PDMS to the coverslip and the adhesion of platelets to the coated coverslip. The following is a gentle cleaning procedure to remove dust and impurities from the surface of PDMS and coverslips.Place the biochip in 400 ml of 10% extran and sonicate for 15 min.Blow dry the biochip completely using compressed air.Note: Make sure the biochip is completely dry before proceeding. Remnants from small droplets can compromise the contact between the biochip and the coverslip leading to leakage during a microfluidics experiment. Place the biochip in 100% Butan-1-ol and sonicate for 30 min.Note: The PDMS will swell slightly and show indentations after the Butan-1-ol treatment. This is normal and the PDMS will return to its original shape and size once sonicated in dH2O. Blow dry the biochip completely using compressed air. Place the biochip in 10% extran and sonicate for 10 min.Blow dry the device using compressed air. Place the biochip in dH2O and sonicate for 10 min.Blow dry the device using compressed air.With the channel side facing down, place the biochip on a #1 coverslip. Press the PDMS down on the coverslip with the palm of your hand and smooth out any bubbles with your finger.",
    "Notes: A good seal needs to be made between the PDMS and the coverslip to prevent leakage of cells from the sides of the channel. The coverslip should be cleaned to remove any dust and smudges that may interfere with contact between the PDMS and the coverslip. The coverslip can be cleaned using Steps B1 and B5. The PDMS can be reused after the microfluidics experiment. Clean the PDMS again by following Procedure B. Store the PDMS in a sealed container away from light. The PDMS can be reused until it is permanently bent and does not stick properly to a coverslip. In our experience, the PDMS can be reused at least 10 times. The size of the coverslip used depends on the size of the biochip. Choose a coverslip size that is closest to the area of the biochip.Coating the channel of the biochip The steps involved in the coating of the biochip (Section C) can be found in Video 1.Place 100 μl of fibrinogen (40 μg/ml final fibrinogen concentration in PBS, pH 7.4) in the 6 mm inlet of the biochip.Using a 1.5 ml transfer pipette, draw the fibrinogen through the channel and into the pipette.Notes: A good seal between the transfer pipette and the 1 mm outlet must be made, otherwise the fibrinogen will not transverse the channel properly. Bubbles in the pipette indicate that good suction was not achieved. Do not drain the inlet or the channel completely. Draw up enough of the fibrinogen solution until you are certain that the channel has been filled with the fibrinogen solution. To remove the pipette from the outlet, apply positive pressure on the transfer pipette until the fluid stops drawing into the pipette, then remove the pipette.",
    "To check that the channel has been filled with the coating substrate (fibrinogen), rotate the biochip back and forth under light. Due to the refractive index mismatch between air and PDMS, an empty channel will be slightly less transparent than a channel filled with fluid, leading to a shimmering of the channel under light. Incubate the biochip for 2 h at 25 °C.Note: The incubation period and temperature will depend on the coating substrate used to coat the channel. However, the longer the channel is left incubating, the greater the risk of the channel leaking. Remove the fibrinogen in the inlet well, replace with 100 μl of Tyrode’s buffer or PBS and repeat Step D2 to wash the channel.Remove the Tyrode’s buffer or PBS from the inlet well and replace with 100 μl of blocking buffer. Repeat Step D2 to block the channel with blocking buffer. Incubate for 30 min at 25 °C.Remove the blocking buffer from the inlet well, replace with 100 μl of Tyrode’s buffer or PBS and repeat Step D2 to wash the channel.Note: Once washed, keep the Tyrode’s buffer or PBS in the channel until image acquisition. This will prevent the formation of air bubbles in the channel while flowing cells through the biochip.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Coating of the in-house PDMS biochip Isolation of platelets from whole bloodHuman platelets The procedure of drawing human blood by venipuncture is determined by the Institution’s Ethics and Protocols for human blood sampling.Draw 8 ml venous blood by venipuncture into an ACD tube. Centrifuge at 200 x g for 20 min, no brake, and separate the platelet-rich plasma (supernatant). Allow platelet-rich plasma to rest in the water bath at 37 °C for 30 min.Add PGE1 to the platelet rich plasma (1 µM final concentration) immediately prior to centrifugation.",
    "Centrifuge at 800 x g for 20 min, no brake, and discard the platelet-poor plasma (supernatant).Resuspend the platelet pellet in HEPES-Tyrodes’ buffer with glucose. Perform a platelet count on the hematology analyzer and adjust the platelet concentration to 3 x 105/µl (Nesbitt et al., 2009). Five minutes before perfusing through the microfluidic channel, add calcein to a final concentration of 1 µg/ml and keep the platelets in the dark until use. Use the labeled platelets within an hour as the calcein is effluxed out of the cell and cell fluorescence will be lost.Mouse plateletsThe procedure of drawing mouse blood by venipuncture is determined by the Institution’s Animal Ethics and local protocols.Draw 1 ml of blood by cardiac puncture after CO2 euthanization or by venipuncture of the inferior vena cava under anesthesia.Centrifuge the blood on a tabletop centrifuge at 400 x g for 5 min.Collect the platelet-rich plasma (supernatant) and 1/8 of the upper red blood cell layer.Add 200 µl of HEPES-Tyrodes’ buffer with glucose to the red blood cell layer and gently mix.

Centrifuge the red blood cell layer at 200 x g for 6 min.Collect the supernatant without disturbing the red blood cell layer and pool with the platelet-rich plasma from Step 7.Allow the platelet-rich plasma to rest for 10 min at room temperature. At the end of the incubation, add PGE1 (0.",
    "5 µM final concentration) and centrifuge the plasma at 500 x g for 10 min.Discard the platelet-poor plasma (supernatant) and resuspend the pellet in HEPES-Tyrode’s buffer with glucose. Perform a platelet count on the hematology analyzer and adjust the platelet concentration to 300 x 103/µl.Prior to performing a microfluidics assay, incubate the platelets with anti-GPIb 488 antibody (3 µg/ml final concentration) for 10 min at room temperature, in the dark.Notes:  For both human and mouse platelets: All centrifugation steps are at room temperature. Platelet suspensions cannot be stored at 4 °C at any step.  Platelets should be used within 4 h of collection by venipuncture. Perfusion assays are performed in the dark. Image acquisitionAssemble the syringe pump as shown below (Figure 2). Connect the 2 ml Luer lock glass syringe to the horizontal facing female Luer lock on the 3-way connector.

    "After the video camera preview has been initiated the channel will be displayed on the screen (Figure 9B).Notes: For steps “washout pump” and “washout cable”, the outlet pin is removed. The pump flows the connected pump solution (water or PBS) into the cable whose free end should be placed into a waste collector. For step “wash/connect biochip”, the outlet pin is connected to the cable but not to the outlet channel of the biochip. The needle of the outlet pin is held above the outlet position of the channel. When you right-click “wash/connect biochip”, the pump will deliver a squirt of 100 μl pump solution into the outlet well to avoid air entering into the channel when the needle is inserted into the outlet. This step can be omitted if you have already included some fluid in the well by pipetting. For the step “washout chip”, the outlet pin has to be inserted into the outlet of the channel. The default setting is to deliver 40 μl of pump fluid at 1 μl/sec to wash out the channel. For the step “cell assay”, enter the parameters for flow by adjusting the shear units, the acquisition time and capture delay (if required).
