Upon heating up to 400K, the experimental    χ M  T   product increases until 9 cm3 mol-1·K, consistent with a complete spin transition of the central FeII ion, resulting in a 100% HS-HS-HS FeII trimer in the sample, see Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8].\nCritical: In some SCO compounds, the spin transition is accompanied by a crystallographic phase transition. This phase transition can be followed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and by variable temperature PXRD. In our case, we performed DSC (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]) analysis and collected PXRD patterns under vacuum at different temperatures (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]) to rule out the participation of a crystallographic phase transition.\nNote: All PXRD plots are well fitted with the crystallographic data from the Fe3 and Zn3 single-crystal solution, obtaining similar refined cell parameters in all the samples.\nNote: First DSC cycle (left) shows the dehydration occurring during the first heating branch, and the absence of any feature during the first cooling branch.

This cryostat is placed inside a sample compartment of Agilent 8453 diode array spectrophotometer (l = 190–1,100 nm), see Figure 15[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig15].",
    "Set the kinetic mode in the spectrometer software (1 spectra·min-1) and manually set the temperature in the cryostat during heating and cooling processes (0.5 K min-1 – 0.1 K min-1 range scan rate).\nThe exact temperature in the solution was monitored by thermocouple Pt100 controller.\nCritical: . It is important to monitor the exact sample temperature that correspond to each spectrum to mitigate the difference between the set and sample temperature (up to 8 degrees at low temperature 240 K) and the different thermalization during cooling and warming processes, Figure 16[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig16].\nUV-Vis absorption data\nThe evolution of the absorption band around 320 nm is analyzed upon warming and cooling processes in 293-240 K range, Figure 17[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig17].\nFrom these spectra, we plot the evolution of absorbance at 320 nm as a function of temperature in the warming and cooling branches obtaining hysteresis cycle describing the spin transition, Figure 18[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig18]."
