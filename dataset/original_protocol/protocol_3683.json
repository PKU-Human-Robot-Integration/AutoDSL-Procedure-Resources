    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nThe main procedure is divided into seven steps (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/61-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Formaldehyde Cross-Link\nEdU Labeling\nTiming: 1 day\nThis step describes EdU incorporation into the genome of the cells.\nPrepare an intermediate dilution of EdU at 100 μM in ESC media from the EdU stock solution. This is a 1000× EdU solution for ESCs.\nCaution: Prepare the solution in the sterile tissue culture hood and use gloves.\nChange media from exponentially growing ESCs cultures that have been split one day in advance (2 x 105 cells/mL at initial concentration), by adding 25 mL (or the corresponding volume of media) of fresh media with or without 0.1-μM EdU. Incubate the cells for 20 h.\nCell Fixation and Permeabilization\nTiming: 1–1.5 h\nThis step describes the chemical crosslinking of chromatin interacting molecules and permeabilization of cellular membrane.\nAdd 1.5-mL formaldehyde fixation solution 16% (wt/vol) to the growing cells, by adding it directly to the media. Mix gently and then incubate for 10 min at 25°C. Note that the ESC media will turn slightly yellow (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nCaution: Add the solution under a fume hood and use gloves.\nAdd 2.5-mL glycine solution (1.25 M) directly to the fixed cells to quench the formaldehyde. Mix gently and then incubate for 5 min at 25°C. Note that the ESC media will turn even more yellow (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nDiscard the media from the dishes.\nCaution: Fixation solution is harmful for both researchers and the environment. Dispense the fixation solution in an appropriated recipient.\nWash the attached cells three times with PBS 1× (pH 7.4).",
