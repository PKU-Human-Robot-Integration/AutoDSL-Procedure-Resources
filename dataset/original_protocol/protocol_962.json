    "**Step A: Pathway Tools based reconstruction to find auxotrophies**\nThe input to Step A is a high-confidence EC set for the parasitic worms. \n1. Run Pathway Tools pipeline for each species using Biocyc database. It uses a set of rules to assign evidence scores for pathway predictions based on: presence of most of the ECs for a pathway, presence of unique ECs, presence of the first two steps \\(for a degradation pathway), presence of the last two steps \\(for a biosynthetic pathway), presence of >50% enzymes \\(for energy metabolism pathways). It also uses taxonomic pruning, wherever information is available, to reduce false-positives\n  2. Analyze biosynthesis pathways for vitamins and amino acids. These can then be compared to identify species or species-group specific auxotrophies.\n  The output from Step A is a table showing each species’ biosynthetic capability of vitamins and amino acids.\n**Step B: Reconstructed KEGG pathways and chokepoints comparison**\nThe input to Step B is a high-confidence EC set for the parasitic worms. \n1. From the reference pathways in KEGG database, remove those that aren’t relevant to helminths. This is done by including only the KEGG pathways that have at least one reference pathway for a nematode/platyhelminth species in the KEGG database. This meant excluding pathways such as ‘Carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms’, even if some of the enzymes implicated in these pathways are found in helminths. In addition, some manual curation may be needed. E.g. excluding caffeine metabolism, which does have a reference pathway for some nematodes \\(<sup>C. elegans</sup> and <sup>C. briggsae</sup> KEGG v70) but is deemed unlikely to be of relevance to most helminths studied by us. For KEGG v70, this leaves 65 KEGG pathways deemed to be ‘helminth-relevant’.",
    "2. Coverage is defined as the fraction of all reference pathway ECs that are annotated in a given species. Calculate coverage for every helminth-relevant KEGG metabolic pathway.\n  3. Coverage is compared separately among different groups of worms. These groups are either phylum level \\(platyhelminths and nematodes) or subsets thereof \\(cestodes and trematodes for platyhelminths and parasites from different clades of nematodes). Some comparisons are done among only the parasites. This means defining groups like ‘Clade IVa-’ \\(all Clade IVa worms except the free living e.g. <sup>Rhabditophanes</sup>) and ‘Clade V-’ \\(all Clade V worms except the free living e.g. <sup>C. elegans</sup> and <sup>P. pacificus</sup>). The comparisons are performed using Wilcoxon tests, and FDR corrected P-values \\(corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure) are used to assign significance \\(P<0.05).\n  4. Coverage diversity is compared between different worm groups. The coefficient of variation of pathway coverage is used to measure the variation in coverage of these pathways among these groups. Comparisons are also performed across all worms between different ‘superpathways’ \\(e.g. combining all ‘amino acid metabolism’ pathways together). Wilcoxon test over the distribution of coefficient of variation is performed for these comparisons.\n  5. The chokepoint enzymes are identified according to Taylor et al<sup>5</sup>, with the following modification: the metabolic networks analyzed are not the entire reference reaction sets in KEGG, but only the subnetworks formed by the reactions annotated in the species of interest \\(including ECs from hole-filling), resulting in more organism-specific metabolic networks.  Chokepoints are reported in context of these species-specific networks. \n  6. Clustering of species based on detected chokepoint enzymes is performed. This is just a presence-absence based clustering using the Jaccard similarity index and Ward-linkage method. \n  7. Generate a phylogenetic tree to see whether closely related species share chokepoints in general.",
    "The output from Step B is statistical metrics \\(P-values) for comparison between worm groups for pathway coverage extent and coverage diversity. It also yields a set of species-specific chokepoints and a phylogenetic tree based on presence-absence of those chokepoints. \n**Step C: KEGG metabolic module completion analysis.**\nThe input to Step C is a high-confidence EC set for the parasitic worms. \n1. Presence/absence of KEGG metabolic ‘modules’ are ascertained using the modDFS algorithm<sup>4</sup>. The algorithm starts from the final product of the module and systematically traverses all those nodes which can produce this product by a chain of substrate-product relations. \n  2. Species clustering based on presence/absence of modules is performed using Ward-linkage based on the Jaccard similarity index. Generate a phylogenetic tree to see whether closely related species share metabolic modules in general.\n  3. For applications that are sensitive to false negatives, a “lenient completion” is also ascertained<sup>4</sup>.\n  4. Species clustering based on lenient presence/absence of modules is performed using Ward-linkage based on the Jaccard similarity index. Generate a phylogenetic tree to see whether closely related species share metabolic modules in general.\n  The output from Step C is a table showing which KEGG metabolic modules are either strictly or leniently complete in which worm species. When interpreting these results it must be remembered to only use the lenient completion results to remove potential false negatives.\n**Step D: Species and group comparison based on EC content.**\nThe input to Step D is a high-confidence EC set for the parasitic worms.\n1. Species clustering based on presence/absence of ECs is performed using Ward-linkage based on the Jaccard similarity index. Generate a phylogenetic tree to see whether closely related species share metabolic potential defined simply by presence of individual ECs.",
    "The output from Step D is a phylogenetic tree which can be used to find potential peculiarities in metabolic potential evolution."
