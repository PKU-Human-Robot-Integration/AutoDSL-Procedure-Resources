    "Ethical approval for use of breast tissue material in this study was obtained from the University Research Ethics Committee (UREC) of the University of Malta (Ref: 22/2012).\n1. Tissue Preparation\nUsing appropriate H&E procedures14, prepare stained reference tissue sections and digitally scan the slides for reference during microdissection.\nUsing a microtome, cut 20 µm tissues sections onto an RNAse-free water bath at 40 °C. Collect the sections on membrane slides for laser microdissection using clean, RNase-decontaminated equipment and materials.\nDry the membrane slides at 37 °C in a drying incubator overnight. Stain using the appropriate H&E procedure15 with molecular biology grade solutions and increasing the staining time of Hematoxylin to 6 min. If required, stain the membrane slides with the appropriate immunohistochemical protocols16.\n2. Laser Microdissection\nSet the slide limits and calibrate the stage movement.\n\t\nMove the laser view onto an empty area of a membrane slide. Calibrate the laser focus by firing a laser shot at increasing focus intervals (5%) until the laser starts to pierce through the membrane. Draw and microdissect any shape and finetune the laser focus to maximize the laser efficiency during the laser dissection.\nIncrease the stage movement speed to a point where the laser dissection efficiency is not compromised. Calibrate the laser at the selected objective lens and re-calibrate if changing objectives (laser speed at 1–15%, focus at 70–75%, and power at 90–100% when using the 4X objective).\nScan the stained membrane slides using the 4X objective.\nSelect and encircle the target areas for microdissection on the membrane slide. Laser dissect a minimum area of 42 mm2. Record the area dissected to determine the volume of sample homogenizing buffer to be used.",
    "Use the cap lift mechanism to retrieve the dissected section onto the diffuser caps of labeled tubes attached to the appropriate appendage. If the dissected section is not retrieved onto the cap, repeat the laser dissection of the area.\n3. Tissue Lysis\nNote: Several solutions and materials are supplied along with kits mentioned in the Table of Materials.\nPrepare the required homogenizing mixture volume for sample lysis using homogenizing solution and proteinase K at a 60:1 ratio.\nPipette 2.4 µL of homogenizing solution into each tube for each 1 mm2 of tissue area, vortex for 10 s at the maximum speed, and centrifuge at room temperature for 5 s at 2,500 x g.\nIncubate in a heating block at 65 °C for 12–18 h with shaking at 600 rpm.\nCentrifuge the lysates at 21,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nUsing a pipette, carefully aspirate the clear supernatant and dispense into a labeled fresh tube. Avoid aspirating the tissue/membrane fragments as this may reduce the quality of results.\nStore the clear supernatant in a -80 °C freezer.\n4. Hybridization-based Assay\nPerform the following preparations.\n\t\nPre-warm the lysis mixture by placing the reagent bottle in an incubator at 37 °C for 30 min and mix gently by inversion.\nIf the tissue homogenates are frozen, thaw at room temperature and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min. Vortex the samples at the maximum speed following the incubation.\nSet the shaking incubator at 54 °C and place the probe of the temperature validation kit in an empty well of a 96-well plate. After 2 h check the temperature on the digital thermometer and set the delta temperature of shaking incubator to correct for any temperature difference.",
    "Thaw and vortex the probe set and blocking reagent for 10 s, centrifuge at room temperature for 5 s at 2,500 x g, and keep on ice.\nKeep the Proteinase K vial on ice during use.\nSonicate the capture beads at 46 KHz for 3 min, then vortex at the maximum speed for another 3 min.\nPrepare a 25 µL working bead mix per well by scaling up the following reagents accordingly: 4.25 µL of Nuclease-free water, 16.65 µL of lysis mixture, 1.00 µL of blocking reagent, 0.10 µL of Proteinase K, 0.50 µL of capture beads, 2.50 µL of probe set.\nVortex the working bead mix for 10 s at maximum speed, then pipette 25 µL/well into the magnetic separation plate.\nPipette 25 µL tissue homogenate to a magnetic separation 96-well plate and 25 µL homogenizing solution to 3 wells as the blanks.\nSeal the magnetic separation plate using a clear plastic pressure seal and place the plate in the incubator at 54 ± 1 °C for 18–22 h while shaking at 600 rpm.\nPrepare a 1X wash buffer solution for 24 wells by mixing 31.5 mL of RNase-free water with 0.1 mL of wash buffer component 1 and 1.67 mL of wash buffer component 2.\nRemove the plate from incubator. Set the temperature of the shaking incubator to 50 ± 1 °C.\nMount the magnetic separation plate on the hand-held magnetic plate washer and lock in place. Remove the pressure seal and wait 1 min for the magnetic beads to settle.",
    "Washing Step: Invert the magnetic separation plate mounted onto the plate over the sink and blot gently on a tissue paper to remove residual solution. Using a multichannel pipette add 100 µL of 1X wash buffer solution into each well and wait 15 s. Repeat this step to wash the plate 3 times.\nPipette 50 µL of the pre-amplifier reagent to each well. Seal the plate with an aluminum plate seal and shake the plate at 800 rpm for 1 min at room temperature. Incubate for 1 h at 50 ± 1 °C while shaking at 600 rpm.\nRepeat step 4.9 (Washing step).\nPipette 50 µL of the amplifier reagent to each well. Seal the plate with an aluminum plate seal and shake the plate as in step 4.10.\nRepeat step 4.9 (Washing step).\nVortex the label probe for 10 s at maximum speed. Add 50 µL of the label probe to each well. Seal and shake the plate (step 4.10).\nRepeat Step 4.9 (Washing step).\nVortex the Streptavidin phycoerythrin (SAPE) for 10 s at maximum speed. Add 50 µL of SAPE to each well. Seal and shake the plate (step 4.10).\nRepeat Step 4.9 (Washing step) except use the SAPE wash buffer instead of the wash buffer solution.\nAdd 130 µL of SAPE wash buffer to each well and seal plate with an aluminum plate seal. Shake the plate at 800 rpm at room temperature for 3 min.\nStart-up the magnetic bead analyzer. Perform the calibration and verification routine by following the manufacturer’s instructions.",
    "Set up a protocol on the magnetic bead analyzer using the following parameters: Sample Size: 100 µL; DD Gate: 5,000–25,000; Timeout: 90 s; Bead Event/Bead Region: 100; and click next. Select the respective bead numbers in the panel and define the bead regions with the respective target genes as indicated by the manufacturer.\nAdd a new analysis by selecting “Create Batch using an existing protocol” from the Batches tab. In the plate layout designate the wells as unknown or blank, respectively and provide a label for each sample in the Samples Panel.\nRemove the aluminum plate seal from the 96-well reaction plate. Eject the plate tray by clicking on the Eject button, load the plate into the magnetic bead analyzer. Click Retract| Run Batch to initiate the analyzer. After reading, eject and remove the 96-well plate. Clean and shut down the magnetic bead analyzer as recommended by the manufacturer.\n5. Data Analysis\nIn the Batch| Results tab, select the respective analysis file and click the export to.csv button. Open the.csv file using a spreadsheet software.\nObserve the bead counts and omit any results with < 40 beads/region.\nAverage out the values of the blank wells and work out the standard deviation (SD) and Limit of Detection (LOD) (blank average + (3xSD)) per target gene. Set the values lower than the LOD as undetected.\n\tNote: If any of the normalizing expression values are undetected, regard the sample data as inadequate. Consider expression values over 20,000 as over the upper sensitivity limit. The lysates of these samples should be diluted and re-analyzed.\nSubtract the blank average from the raw data per gene.\nCompute the geometric mean of the selected normalizing genes per sample. Normalize individual sample data to the respective geometric mean.",
    "Analyze the data on data science platforms or using defined algorithms.\n\t\nImport the data into the data science platform by clicking Add Data. Drag the data file into the Process Workspace and connect to a [Select Attributes] operator, then to a Principal component analysis (PCA) operator, and then to the result port.\nIn the Select Attribute operator select the subset of normalized gene data and a nominal variable such as breast cancer subtype. Run the process by clicking Play. In the Charts Tab select the “Scatter 3D Color” in the Chart style and the nominal variable in the Color field. Assess the PCA data variability on a 3-dimensional plot."
