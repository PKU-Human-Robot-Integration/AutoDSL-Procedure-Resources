    "All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Veterinary Office of the Canton Zurich, Switzerland.\n1. Animal Handling and Habituation\nAnimal Handling\n\tNote: 5 days prior to the start of the experiment, perform step 1.1.1 daily.\n\t\nFor behavioral experiments, accustom the animals to the experimenter. Have daily handling sessions lasting 10-15 min per animal. Clean the box after each animal’s session.\n\t\t\nInitially, place the experimenter’s hand into a cage allowing the animal to explore and smell to become familiarized with the experimenter.\nNext, gently lift the animal with the experimenter’s hand in a safe manner by grasping the rat’s body between the front- and hind paws allowing further familiarization.\nWeigh each animal daily to obtain a baseline bodyweight before food deprivation.\nApparatus Habituation and Food Familiarization\n\t\nWeigh each animal daily to obtain a baseline bodyweight before food deprivation.\nStart food depriving rats 3 days prior to the beginning of pre-training on a standard laboratory diet. Give rats 0.05 g of food per 1 g bodyweight per day (e.g., a rat weighing 200 g, start with 10 g of food). Ensure bodyweight to not decrease more than 10% per day by monitoring bodyweight daily.\n\t\t\nIf several animals are held in one cage, dominant rats may eat more than less dominant ones. In case the bodyweight of an animal decreases, feed the animal separately instead of group feeding. Give water ad libitum.\nTo acquaint the rat with the grasping apparatus, place the animal into the training box (Figure 1). Have sugar pellets placed in the training box in proximity to the slit opening to familiarize the animal with the food pellets. Perform this step 10-15 min daily for 3 days.\n2. Pre-training and Motor Skill Learning\nPre-training",
    "One day after familiarization, place the animal into the training box and place the pellet closely to the slit opening so it can be reached by the animal’s tongue. Exclude animals that retrieve pellets with their forelimb during pre-training\n\t\tNote: At this stage, pellet retrieval with the tongue is crucial and usually the animal’s method of choice. Pellets should be in no case grasped with the forelimb until the first day of motor skill learning to allow adequate monitoring of the learned reaching task. Pellet retrieval with the forelimb during pre-training is an exclusion criterion and is in most cases not observed.\nTeach the rat to either run to the rear of the cage and return to the slit opening or step back and turn around its own axis in order to receive the next food pellet with the tongue. Allow time for the animal to explore the cage, run to the rear and return to the slit opening. If the animal does not correctly execute the task, use a forceps to gently tap at the end rear of the cage and catch the animal’s attention. Once the animal is at the rear, gently tap at the cage front to guide the animal to the slit opening.\n\t\tNote: Once the animal reaches a defined standard value (e.g., 50 successful pellet retrievals with the tongue in less than 15 min), the animal qualifies for the motor skill learning stage. On day 1 and 2 of pre-training, learners can already be distinguished from non-learners. Non-learners can be excluded from the study at this step. This decreases the probability of having a high number of non-learners during the motor learning step (2.2).",
    "During pre-training, food deprive rats on a standard laboratory diet. Give water ad libitum. Monitor body weight daily throughout the study. Do not use same room to train male and female rats. Ensure a calm and noise-free environment for the animal.\nDetermination of Paw Preference and Motor Skill Learning\n\t\nDuring the first session of motor skill learning, replace the slide in front of the window with a post. Place the sugar pellet about 1.5 cm away from the window on the post so that the animal cannot reach the pellet with its tongue but only retrieve it by a precise forelimb reaching and grasping movement.\n\t\t\nTo enforce pellet retrieval by the forelimb, use a forceps to gently bring the pellet close to the animal’s mouth and retract the pellet while the animal attempts consumption with the tongue. Carry out this task repetitively until the animal stretches out the forelimb and grasps a pellet.\nPlace the post central to the window opening. To determine paw preference, carefully observe the first 10 trials on training day 1. More than 70% of the reaching attempts (i.e., 7 out of 10) have to be executed with the same forelimb. If this is not achieved, continue with another round of 10 trials until the 70% threshold is reached.\nAfter paw preference determination, shift the post towards the preferred forelimb and align central to the border of the window opening. Preferred paw alignment means the post is shifted contrary to the respective paw to allow an optimal angle for reaching (Figure 1B, C).",
    "Classify a trial, defined as a new pellet presented to the animal, as successful (reach, grasp, retrieve and eat the pellet), drop (reach, grasp and lose pellet during retrieval) or fail (knock pellet off the post). Note down every trial in your sheet and analyse the data after the experiment.\nPerform one daily session consisting of a defined number of trials (e.g., 150) or a maximum time (e.g., 1 hr) for each animal.\nInvestigate precision and fine-tuning of the movement using first attempt analysis. A first attempt is defined by grasping of the pellet in a single monolithic movement without disruption, hesitation or repetition of individual movement components. Carefully observe each grasp by the rat.\n\t\t\nIf the rat hesitates or retracts during a reach or attempts several trials to correctly grasp the pellet, note the respective trial as success but not first attempt. If the animal successfully grasps the pellet in a single monolithic reach, note down the respective trial as successful first attempt in a separate column in your sheet.\nDuring motor skill learning, food deprive rats on a standard laboratory diet. Give water ad libitum. Monitor body weight daily throughout the study.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
