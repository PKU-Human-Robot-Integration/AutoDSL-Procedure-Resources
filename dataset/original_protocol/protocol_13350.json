    "A schematic overview of the methods below is depicted in Figure 1 and a detailed list of materials and reagents is available in the Table of Materials.\n1. Preparation of assay buffers.\nPreparation of stock buffers.\n\tNOTE: As the assay is sensitive to the detection of phosphates, which can be commonplace, rinse glassware three times with ultrapure or double-distilled water to avoid contamination. All buffers can be stored at room temperature (RT).\n\t\nPrepare 1 L of SAMHD1 reaction buffer (RB) stock solution (25 mM Tris-Acetate pH 8, 40 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2) by dissolving 4.5 g Tris Acetate, 2.3 g NaCl, and 0.2 g MgCl2, in approximately 800 mL of water before adjusting to pH 8 and final volume.\nPrepare 5 mL of 0.1 M TCEP stock solution by diluting 1 mL of 0.5 M TCEP into 4 mL of water.\nPrepare 50 mL of 11% Tween-20 stock solution by diluting 5 mL of 100% Tween-20 into 44.5 mL of water.\n\t\tNOTE: Tween-20 is light sensitive.\nPrepare 50 mL of 0.5 M EDTA stop solution by dissolving 9.3 g EDTA in approximately 40 mL of water before adjusting to pH 8 and final volume.\nPrepare Malachite Green (MG) stock solution (3.2 mM malachite green in H2SO4) by slowly adding 60 mL concentrated sulfuric acid to 300 mL water in a brown glass bottle. Cool the solution to RT and dissolve 0.44 g malachite green.\nCAUTION: The reaction of sulfuric acid with water is exothermic and so the bottle may heat up causing a build-up of pressure; ensure this pressure is released frequently.\n\t\tNOTE: The resulting orange solution is light sensitive (hence brown bottle) and stable for at least 1 year at RT. Precipitate may form over time, ensure only the supernatant is used.",
    "Prepare 50 mL of 7% ammonium molybdate stock solution by dissolving 3.75 g ammonium molybdate in 50 mL of water.\n\t\t​NOTE: Precipitate may form over time, ensure only the supernatant is used.\nPreparation of complete assay buffers\n\tNOTE: This should be done on the day of the experiment\n\t\nPrepare complete SAMHD1 RB (25 mM Tris-Acetate pH 8, 40 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM TCEP, 0.005% Tween-20). Use previously prepared 11% Tween-20 and 0.1 M TCEP stocks to add these components at a final concentration of 0.005% for Tween-20 and 0.3 mM for TCEP to the SAMHD1 RB stock.\nPrepare EDTA stop solution (25 mM Tris-Acetate pH 8, 40 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM TCEP, 0.005% Tween-20, 7.9 mM EDTA). To complete SAMHD1 RB, use 0.5 M EDTA stock solution to add EDTA to a final concentration of 7.9 mM.\nPrepare MG working solution (2.5 mM malachite green, 1.4% ammonium molybdate, 0.18% Tween-20) by mixing 10 parts of MG stock solution with 2.5 parts of 7% ammonium molybdate and 0.2 parts of 11% Tween-20.\n2. SAMHD1 inhibition assay and determination of compound IC50\nNOTE: Final assay conditions are shown in Table 1.\nPreparation of compounds in assay plate\n\tNOTE: Small molecular weight compounds are typically dissolved in 100% DMSO and nucleotide analogues in water. Stock concentration ranges from 10 to 100 mM and is influenced by the potency and solubility of the compounds, together with the DMSO tolerance of the assay. Check that the final DMSO concentration in the reaction does not exceed 1% to ensure enzyme activities are not affected by this solvent. It is good practice to test the tolerance of the assay to the solvent prior to the experiment.",
    "Prepare serially diluted test compounds at 100x final concentration in the relevant solvent (e.g., 100% DMSO for small molecules or water for nucleotide analogues) in a clear round-bottomed polypropylene 96-well plate using either a multichannel pipette or automated liquid handling equipment.\n\t\tNOTE: Depending upon compound stability, dilution plates can be prepared in advance, sealed, and stored at -20 °C. Allow plates to equilibrate to RT before continuing the protocol.\nUsing complete SAMHD1 RB, dilute compounds to 25x final concentration (to maintain the final solvent concentration below 1%) and transfer 5 µL to the appropriate wells of a clear 384-well flat-bottomed assay plate. Repeat the procedure with solvent-only control samples.\nPreparation of reaction components\n\tNOTE: This should be done on the day of the assay. Recombinant human SAMHD1 and E. coli pyrophosphatase (PPase) aliquots are stored long term at -80 °C diluted at 9.1 mg/mL and 23.0 mg/mL, respectively, in storage buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mM TCEP). Once thawed, aliquots are stored short-term at -20 °C.\n\t\nPrepare enzyme (SAMHD1/PPase) master mix by diluting recombinant human SAMHD1 protein and recombinant PPase in complete SAMHD1 RB to 4x desired final concentration, thus 1.4 µM SAMHD1 and 50 U/mL PPase.\nPrepare activator/substrate dGTP by diluting dGTP stock (typically 10 or 100 mM in water) in complete SAMHD1 RB to 2x final concentration, thus 50 µM dGTP.\nPerform the assay\n\tNOTE: All assay components should be equilibrated to RT. Liquid additions can be performed with either a multichannel pipette or a bulk reagent liquid dispenser.\n\t\nTo 384-well assay plate containing compound dilutions and solvent only controls, dispense 5 µL of SAMHD1/PPase master mix. To no enzyme control wells, dispense 5 µL of complete SAMHD1 RB. Pre-incubate enzyme and compounds for 10 min at RT.",
    "To all wells, dispense 10 µL of 2x dGTP solution to start the reaction.\nIncubate the reaction for 20 min at RT.\nStop the reaction by dispensing 20 µL EDTA stop solution to all wells.\n\t\tNOTE: The experiment can be paused here if desired.\nAdd 10 µL MG working solution to all wells.\nCAUTION: MG working solution contains sulfuric acid.\nEnsure mixing of well contents using an orbital microwell plate shaker and centrifugation at 1,000 x g for 1 min.\nIncubate the plate for 20 min at RT.\nRead the absorption at 630 nm wavelength in a microwell plate reader.\nData visualization and analysis\nCalculate the average and standard deviation of the positive and negative control wells (positive, complete reaction with solvent; negative, dGTP alone with solvent). Calculate Z-factor37 as an indicator of assay quality.\nNormalize each absorbance value to the mean values of the positive and negative controls, setting the positive control as 100% SAMHD1 activity and the negative control as 0% SAMHD1 activity.\nPlot SAMHD1 activity (%) as a function of compound concentration and fit a four-parameter variable slope dose-response curve, allowing determination of compound IC50.\n3. SAMHD1 activator and substrate screen\nNOTE: Final assay conditions are shown in Table 2. Recombinant SAMHD1 and PPase aliquots are stored long term at -80 °C diluted at 9.1 mg/mL and 23.0 mg/mL, respectively, in storage buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mM TCEP) at -80 °C. Once thawed, aliquots are stored short term at -20 °C.\nPreparation of nucleotide analogues in assay plate\nDilute nucleotide analogue stocks (typically 10 or 100 mM in water) to 4x final concentration in complete SAMHD1 RB, in our case 800 µM nucleotide analogue, and transfer 5 µL to the appropriate wells of a 384-well assay plate.",
    "Preparation of reaction components\n\tNOTE: This should be done on the day of the assay\n\t\nPrepare enzyme (SAMHD1/PPase) master mix by diluting recombinant human SAMHD1 protein and recombinant E. coli PPase in complete SAMHD1 RB to 2x desired final concentration, thus 0.7 µM SAMHD1 and 25 U/mL PPase.\nPrepare PPase alone solution by diluting recombinant E. coli PPase in complete SAMHD1 RB to 2x desired final concentration, thus 25 U/mL PPase.\nPrepare activators GTP (AS1) and dGTPαS (AS1 and AS2) diluting stock (typically 10 or 100 mM in water) in complete SAMHD1 RB to 4x final concentration, thus 50 µM GTP or dGTPαS.\nPerform the assay\n\tNOTE: All assay components should be equilibrated to RT. Liquid additions can be performed with either a multichannel pipette or a bulk reagent liquid dispenser.\n\t\nTo 384-well assay plate containing nucleotide analogues, dispense 5 µL of the activator (either GTP or dGTPαS) or complete SAMHD1 RB to the appropriate wells.\nStart the reaction by dispensing 10 µL of SAMHD1/PPase master mix, PPase alone, or complete SAMHD1 RB to the appropriate wells.\nIncubate the reaction for 20 min at RT.\nStop the reaction by dispensing 20 µL EDTA stop solution to all the wells.\n\t\tNOTE: The experiment can be paused here if desired.\nAdd 10 µL MG working solution to all the wells.\nCAUTION: MG working solution contains sulfuric acid.\nEnsure mixing of well contents using an orbital microwell plate shaker and centrifugation at 1,000 x g for 1 min.\nIncubate the plate for 20 min at RT.\nRead the absorption at 630 nm wavelength in a microwell plate reader.\nData visualization and analysis\nCalculate the average absorbance values for the PPase only reaction wells (negative control or background signal).",
    "NOTE: As a positive control of a SAMHD1 allosteric activator and substrate, dGTP can be included in the plate. In this case, you may use this condition to calculate Z-factor as an indicator of assay quality.\nSubtract the background value from the corresponding wells in the SAMHD1/PPase reactions.\nPlot corrected absorbance values for each nucleotide analogue with buffer, GTP, and dGTPαS conditions."
