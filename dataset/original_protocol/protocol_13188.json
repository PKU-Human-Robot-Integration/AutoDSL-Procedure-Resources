    "This investigation was conducted according to the National Institutes of Health's guidelines on animal care and use and was approved by the Boston Children's Hospital's Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol 20-08-4247R). All the animals received humane care in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n1. Animal species, anesthetic, and analgesic agents\nAnimal species: Use New Zealand White rabbits (wild type strain; female sex; sexually mature 15-20 weeks old; 3-4 kg body weight) for experimental studies.\nAnesthetic and analgesic agents:\n\t\nUse atropine at a dose of 0.01 mg/kg intramuscular (IM)\nUse acepromazine at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg IM for initial sedation and 0.5 mg/kg intravenous (IV) for full anesthetization.\nUse butorphanol at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg IM.\nUse isoflurane via a precision vaporized system face mask at 3% for induction, followed by intubation at 1%-2%, oxygen (O2) at 100% at 2 L/min, and general anesthesia at 1% for maintenance.\nUse medetomidine at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg IM.\nUse ketamine at a dose of 10 mg/kg IV.\nUse a bupivacaine intercostal block at the thoracotomy site at a dose not exceeding 3 mg/kg IM.\nUse 1% lidocaine at a dose of 1-1.5 mL/kg IV.\nUse a 1-4 µg/kg fentanyl transdermal patch for 72 h.\n2. Procedural steps (Figure 1)\nSedate New Zealand White adult rabbits with a single combined IM injection of atropine, acepromazine, and butorphanol. Induce the animal with 3% isoflurane via a precision vaporized system face mask.\nPreparation prior to blinded endotracheal intubation (i.e., without visualization of the glottis)\n\t\nSpray the larynx with 1% lidocaine to prevent laryngospasm.\nPre-measure the endotracheal tube (ETT) length on the outside of the rabbit from the teeth to the predicted carina, and place the rabbit in a sternal recumbency position with the neck extended.",
    "Intubate the animal with a cuffed pediatric size (3-0 or 3-5 inner diameter) ETT under continuous inhaled anesthetic at 1%-2% and O2 at 100% at 2 L/min.\n\t\nInsert the ETT into the mouth, and direct it past the torus into the pharynx.\nAdvance the ETT until either the tip of the tube contacts the glottis or the breath sounds are lost, indicating the tube tip has passed through the glottic opening.\nSlightly withdraw the tube until the breath sounds are regained, and then re-advance again, and secure the tube in place.\nVentilate the animal with mechanical support (tidal volume: 10 mL/kg, fraction of inspired O2: 40%, respiratory rate: 30-40 breaths/min, positive end-expiratory pressure: 5-10 cmH2O).\n\t\nAdjust the FiO2 as tolerated to achieve an O2 saturation greater than 92% as measured by pulse oximetry to prevent hyperoxia, which can provoke a systemic inflammatory response.\nVerify the proper placement of the ETT by a physical exam (i.e., auscultation), clinical signs (i.e., observation of condensation at the end of the endotracheal tube), and with objective measures (i.e., end-tidal carbon dioxide).\nAfter approximately 10 min, deliver an IM injection of medetomidine to the rabbit to provide simultaneous anesthetic and analgesic effects.\nMaintain the general anesthesia with 1% isoflurane for the duration of the surgical procedure.\nInsert a 22 G IV catheter into the marginal ear vein, and secure it with tape to obtain peripheral IV access.\n\tNOTE: The femoral vein can be used as an alternative site of venous access.\n\t\nFully anesthetize the animal with acepromazine IV and ketamine IV.\nPrior to incision, inject 1,000 U/mL heparin at a dose of 3 mg/kg IV.",
    "Administer 1,000 U/mL heparin at a dose of 3 mg/kg initially, and re-dose hourly until the end of the experiment to maintain an activated clotting time of >400 s, in keeping with the current surgical protocol.\nAdminister 1% lidocaine IV and/or epicardial asynchronized defibrillation as needed if ventricular fibrillation occurs during the surgery. Ventricular fibrillation usually stops with one or two doses of lidocaine.\nPerfuse lactate Ringer's solution continuously at 10 mL/kg/h.\n\t\tNOTE: Given the small volume of fluids administered and the short operative times, the animals in survival studies in this work did not require diuresis prior to extubation or during the recovery period. If the animal develops a worsening pulmonary status (i.e., increasing the ventilator settings, evidence of pulmonary edema on auscultation, etc.), diuresis is advised.\nPerform a carotid cut down, and place a 4 or 5 French arterial line to facilitate the intra-operative monitoring of the arterial blood pressure (BP).\n\tNOTE: The femoral artery can be used as an alternative site of arterial access.\nMonitor and record all the physiologic and mechanical variables by continuous real-time analysis.\n\t\nMonitor the arterial BP with the carotid arterial line, and record the O2 saturation using pulse oximetry via a sensor placed on a shaved paw.\nMonitor with an electrocardiogram (ECG) with three limb leads: I, II, and III, and three computed augmented leads: aVL, aVR, and aVF.\n\t\t\nRecord the ECG tracings at the pre-ischemic baseline, during ischemia, during reperfusion, and serially during days 7-28 of recovery (if performing a survival study).\nMonitor the level of sedation by continuous monitoring of the BP and heart rate (HR).\nMonitor the temperature with a rectal probe.\nUse 2D ECHO from the left parasternal and apical views to assess the myocardial function at desired time points in both the survival and non-survival cases.",
    "Assess the myocardial function using the fractional shortening (FS) by measuring the left ventricle end-diastolic distance (LVEDD) and the left ventricle end-systolic distance (LVESD) and using the following formula:\n\t\t\tFS = (LVEDD − LVESD)/LVEDD × 100\nDuring surgery, place the animal on a circulating hot water blanket to maintain a stable core body temperature.\nPrepare and drape the animal in a sterile fashion:\n\t\nShave the surgical site, and prep with betadine and 70% isopropyl alcohol, each applied in triplicate. Pat the area dry with sterile gauze pads, and drape the entire animal with sterile towels.\nLeft mini-thoracotomy (survival studies)\n\t\nPerform an intercostal block at the predetermined thoracotomy site with bupivacaine IM.\nAdminister 1% lidocaine IV via the auricular vein prior to incision.\nPerform a left mini-thoracotomy through the fourth intercostal space along the upper portion of the fifth rib to avoid the neuromuscular bundle, which is located parallel to the undersurface of each rib.\n\t\t\nPerform an anterolateral thoracotomy for the best visualization of the anterolateral surface of the heart (i.e., the anatomic location of the LAD diagonal branches).\nPosition the rabbit with the left side elevated approximately 30° using a pillow or bean bag.\nSecure the rabbit's ipsilateral leg above its head to create room for both the operative field and between the rib spaces.\nPalpate and outline the bony landmarks, including the ribs, sternum, and scapula, with a felt-tipped marking pen. Incise the skin overlying the fifth rib using a #10 blade. Ensure that the incision remains parallel to the rib.\nUse electrocautery to divide the pectoralis major muscle and serratus anterior muscle. Divide the intercoastal muscles right above the fifth rib with electrocautery to preserve the neurovascular bundle.",
    "Cautiously enter the pleural space through the fourth intercostal space with sharp or blunt dissection. Extend the initial pleural incision parallel to the rib in both directions with sharp or blunt dissection until a rib spreader or sternal retractor can be inserted.\nPlace a rib spreader or sternal retractor within the rib space, and widen to provide adequate visualization of the heart and pericardial sac. Lift the pericardium with DeBakey forceps, and open the pericardium with Metzenbaum scissors.\nLAD artery isolation\n\t\t\nEncircle the second or third diagonal branch of the LAD artery with a polypropylene suture (3-0) on a taper needle. Remove the needle, and thread both ends of the polypropylene filament through a small vinyl tube to form a snare.\nPlace a pledget between the snare and the coronary artery to avoid damaging the coronary and/or causing vasospasm with ligation.\n\t\t\t\nUsing DeBakey forceps, pick up a rectangular PTFE felt pledget (approximately 7 mm x 3 mm). Place the pledget between the two polypropylene filaments so that it is sandwiched between the isolated LAD artery and the vinyl tube when the snare is tightened.\nMidline sternotomy (non-survival studies)\n\tNOTE: The midline sternotomy approach is ideal for non-survival cases, for which more invasive monitoring with LVDP and sonomicrometry can be utilized.\n\t\nPerform a midline sternotomy using curved Mayo scissors. Place a sternal retractor, and widen it to provide adequate visualization of the heart and pericardial sac.\nLift the pericardium with DeBakey forceps, and open the pericardium with Metzenbaum scissors.\nPlacing the three piezoelectric sonomicrometry crystals:\n\t\t\nMake three small 1 mm cuts on the epicardium of the LV, forming the corners of a triangle. Place the piezoelectric sonomicrometry crystals inside the epicardium cuts.",
    "Secure the wires to the cardiac surface with a 5-0 polypropylene U-stitch. When recording using sonomicrometry, pause the mechanical ventilation to allow for an accurate recording over two to three heartbeats.\n\t\t\tNOTE: If the heart fibrillates, 1% lidocaine is not effective, and epicardial defibrillation is needed, turn off the sonomicrometer, and disconnect it from the data acquisition system to protect both from electrical input.\nLAD artery isolation:\n\t\t\nEncircle the second or third diagonal branch of the LAD artery with a polypropylene suture (3-0) on a taper needle.\nRemove the needle, and thread both ends of the polypropylene filament through a small vinyl tube to form a snare.\nPlace a pledget between the snare and the coronary artery to avoid damaging the coronary artery and/or causing vasospasm with ligation.\nUsing DeBakey forceps, pick up a rectangular PTFE felt pledget (approximately 7 mm x 3 mm). Place the pledget between the two polypropylene filaments so that it is sandwiched between the isolated LAD artery and the vinyl tube when the snare is tightened.\nMeasurement of the LVDP:\n\t\t\nPlace a 5-0 polypropylene U-stitch in the apex of the LV. Make a small 1 mm incision with an 11 blade into the LV apex.\nInsert a 3 French balloon catheter into the LV lumen. Secure the catheter to the LV by tying it to the 5-0 polypropylene U-stitch suture.\nConnect the catheter to the transducer connected to the monitor to record the LVDP. Record the LVDP using the data acquisition system (described below). Zero the catheter to record the hemodynamic variables by opening the three-way stopcock to the air and zeroing on the monitor.\nData acquisition system\n\t\t\nInitiate the data acquisition system (see the Table of Materials) on the computer/laptop being used. Connect the wire from the monitor to the computer/laptop.",
    "Select Channel 1 on the data acquisition system, and name it LVDP. Zero the transducer using the monitor.\n\t\t\tNOTE: If connecting the BP and HR to the data acquisition system, follow the same process: connect the wire to the laptop, select Channel, and zero if measuring the BP.\nOcclude the coronary artery by tightening the snare by pressing down on the vinyl tube while pulling up on the polypropylene suture filaments. Maintain the desired tightness with a mosquito clamp by directly clamping the tube and fixing it in place.\nConfirm myocardial ischemia visually by the regional cyanosis of the epicardium. Regional ischemia can also be confirmed on ECG with the presence of an ST segment and T wave changes.\nAfter visual confirmation, induce regional ischemia for 30 min under anesthesia.\n\t\nAt 0 min, 10 min, 20 min, and 30 min during the regional ischemia, assess the FS by 2D ECHO for both the survival and non-survival cases.\nAssess the LVDP and sonomicrometry continuously during the pre-ischemia time, myocardial ischemia time, and post-ischemic time for the non-survival cases.\nIf needed, delineate the area at risk by ligating the artery again with the polypropylene suture stitch left in place. Cross-clamp the aorta, and inject Monastral Blue pigment 98% (diluted 1:5 in PBS) through the aorta using a cardioplegia needle. The perfused areas of the myocardium will stain blue, and the area at risk will remain unstained.\nContinuously monitor and record the HR, BP, and O2 saturation.\nAllow the animal to recover for 2 h (non-survival) or 28 days (survival).\n\t\tNOTE: ECG can be used to confirm reperfusion. Although not seen in the experiment conducted in this study, hypokalemia can often occur during reperfusion and can be corrected with potassium control or an appropriate infusion.\nConclusion of the procedure\n\t\nSurvival cases",
    "In survival cases, trim the 3-0 polypropylene thread used for the snare, loosely tie the ends together, and leave it in place. Identify the area at risk and the infarct zone by the 3-0 polypropylene thread.\nAfter the procedure is completed, close the incision in three layers.\n\t\t\t\nClose the first layer by tying two 2-0 polyglactin 910 figure-of-eight stitches around the ribs.\nClose the muscular and subcutaneous layers with a 3-0 polydioxanone suture in a running fashion.\nClose the skin in a subcuticular fashion using a 5-0 monofilament suture. Use a buried running suture to minimize the irritation felt by the animal.\nEvacuate the pleural air by performing a needle thoracentesis.\nApply a fentanyl transdermal patch for 72 h to facilitate the postoperative pain management.\nPerform transthoracic echocardiography at the 1 week and 2 week time points postoperatively to assess the trends in the FS.\nFollowing the predetermined recovery period, sedate, intubate, and anesthetize the animal as above. Perform a median sternotomy. Expose and open the pericardial sac. Euthanize the rabbit under deep anesthesia by removing the heart en bloc, allowing the animal to expire by exsanguination.\nNon-survival cases\n\t\t\nAfter the experiment and having assured deep anesthesia, completely expose the heart, and remove it en bloc for biochemical and tissue analysis. The animal expires by exsanguination.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
