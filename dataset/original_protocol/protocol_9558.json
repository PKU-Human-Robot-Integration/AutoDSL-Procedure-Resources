    "The protocol outlined below adheres to the guidelines and standards established by the University of Missouri Human Research Ethics Committee, ensuring the ethical conduct of the study and the protection of participants' rights, safety, and well-being.\nNOTE: To ensure the reliability and accuracy of hyperpolarized xenon MRI studies, it is crucial to perform rigorous characterization of acquired images, follow a comprehensive protocol, and employ effective troubleshooting strategies. The imaging session involves several steps: gas hyperpolarization, 129Xe coil/scanner communication, 129Xe spectroscopy, acquiring data, data reconstruction, and image analysis.The protocol begins by discussing these steps in detail and highlights the necessary precautions and troubleshooting strategies to optimize the imaging process. By following these procedures and incorporating expert troubleshooting strategies, researchers can optimize the imaging process and overcome challenges that may arise during hyperpolarized xenon MRI studies. Then we will address common troubleshooting practices that may arise in several cases of sub-optimal data.\n1. Key steps for a comprehensive HPG MRI study\nHere we presented a brief overview of processes involved in a typical hyperpolarized 129Xe imaging session. Detailed protocol recommendations from the 129Xe Clinical Trials Consortium are given in Niedbalski et al.11.\n129Xe Hyperpolarization\n\t\nEnsure the 129Xe hyperpolarizer is set up and operational according to the manufacturer's guidelines or lab-specific protocols for custom-made polarizers.\nConduct T1 relaxation measurements using the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique on a representative sample of the HP 129Xe gas at the HP measurement station. In a stable field of 30 mT, xenon in a 1 L gas dose bag should have a T1 of > 45 min.",
    "NOTE: After completing the polarization measurement, the HP 129Xe dose bag should be kept within the magnetic field of the HP measurement station to maintain its polarization until it is ready for transportation to the MR scanner. The polarization will decay according to12,\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65972/65972eq01.jpg     (1.1)\n\t\twhere P(t) is polarization at time t, P0 is initial polarization, and T1 is the magnetization decay rate (not considering polarization losses due to excitation).\nMeasuring polarization loss due to gas transport\n\t\nEnsure a direct and efficient route from the xenon collection point to the magnet room where the imaging will take place.\nMinimize any delays during HP xenon transportation to maintain polarization, as polarization will decay rapidly once the dose is outside the T1-preserving magnetic field.If the polarization decreases by 20% or more during transportation, use a magnetic-shielded suitcase.\nAvoid extraneous RF signals along the transportation route (e.g., card reader, laser, stainless steel board etc.), as they can contribute to polarization loss.\nMeasure the initial dose equivalent (DE) of the HP 129Xe gas before transportation. DE is given by 11,\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65972/65972eq02.jpg     (1.2)\n\t\twhere f129 is the isotropic fraction of 129Xe, P129 is 129Xe nuclear spin polarization, and VXe is the total volume of xenon gas.\nTransport the gas from the measurement station into the magnet bore, then back along the same route to the polarimetry station. Measure DE again after the round trip to quantify the anticipated signal loss during gas transport. If no additional RF signals interfere along the transportation route, the estimated polarization will closely follow the T1 decay curve outlined in equation 1.1.\nMultinuclear (129Xe MRI) coil",
    "Place the 129Xe coil correctly in the magnet to ensure proper orientation. If a quadrature coil is used, avoid anti-quadrature excitation, as it can cause a significant signal drop-off in the center of the imaging volume.\n\t\tNOTE: Xenon coil should accommodate a wide range of chest sizes to accommodate variations in coil tuning/loading between subjects and during different respiration phases, leading to variable delivered flip angles across scans.\nEstablish a secure physical connection between the coil plug and the MR system through the designated socket and configure the coil software to specify the permissible nuclei (129Xe in our case).\nDivide the well-characterized proton resonance frequency on the MR scanner by 3.61529 to obtain the xenon frequency11.\nCharacterize the coil parameters (maximum transmit amplitude, transmitter reference amplitude, specific absorption rate- SAR).\nMeasuring 129Xe spectroscopy\n\t\nCreate a thermally polarized 129-xenon phantom.\n\t\t\nConnect a glass pressure vessel to a xenon gas-filled bag, ensuring an appropriate bag size and xenon volume to align with the vessel's capacity.\nSubmerge the pressure vessel in a small amount of liquid nitrogen (LN2) to allow xenon diffusion and freezing (see Figure 1).\nSeal the vessel after the xenon has formed frozen snow inside, then allow it to thaw, pressurizing the vessel. Calculate the pressure in the vessel: P = (Vvessel + Vbag)/Vvessel where Vvessel is the volume of the vessel and Vbag is the volume of the xenon in the bag.",
    "NOTE: Unlike hyperpolarized gas (HPG) bags, the thermally polarized 129Xe vessel does not need to be purged of oxygen or vacuum evacuated as the additional oxygen will reduce the xenon T1- a favorable effect in the thermally-polarized phantom. Also, it is important to ensure that the gas pressure in the vessel will not exceed the manufacturer's stated pressure limit. With a phantom of 129Xe gas, the xenon frequency can be measured on the MRI console. Commercial xenon phantoms for quality assurance are also available13.\nDetect the peak frequency with a thermally polarized xenon phantom.\n\t\t\nPut the xenon phantom inside the 129Xe coil and place it similar to that of a loaded patient, as differences in coil geometry can substantially alter the delivered B1 to the phantom (Figure 2).\n\t\t\tNOTE: It is recommended that a suitable water phantom be loaded as well to properly load the coil.\nPerform a scan with proton frequency, as some scanners may disallow multinuclear scans without an initial proton frequency localizer.\nUse a broadband transmit pulse (if available), high-bandwidth, and high-resolution readout experiment to accurately detect the xenon frequency peak. A broadband pulse will excite a high range of frequencies, ensuring the xenon NMR can be detected.\nOnce a well-defined peak is detected, record the frequency to full precision and repeat the experiment at the new frequency with low bandwidth (~1000 Hz) to maximize signal-to-noise ratio(SNR) and peak frequency precision (Figure 3).\nOnce a satisfactory, high-signal peak is detected, save the protocol for future QC tests.",
    "NOTE: The precise geometric placement of the coil in the scanner provides a baseline spectroscopy scan, which can be replicated in the future to identify emergent issues if SNR is seen to worsen. The phantom itself can be directly imaged, though it may require multiple acquisitions to build enough signal for image reconstruction and may not provide a fair estimate of achievable SNR as higher flip angles are generally required. A prepared bag of hyperpolarized xenon is the best option for testing the desired imaging protocol with in vivo imaging parameters.\nHP 129Xe imaging with a test bag\n\t\nUse a small amount of HP 129Xe (>300 mL) for imaging, which is well-concentrated and free of oxygen.\nMeasure the 129Xe DE accurately immediately prior to imaging.\nSet the test imaging protocol to reflect desired in vivo parameters as closely as possible11.\nAcquire and save the image of the xenon bag as a baseline measure of scanner performance.\nMeasure and record the SNR of the acquired images alongside all scan parameters and xenon DE. The acceptable SNR for a 2D GRE scan may vary by site, but it should typically be around 30 or higher, with a minimum threshold of 15 for subsequent image analysis11.\nFor measuring flip angle (FA), α, perform a full-volume spoiled gradient-echo scan in which the FOV is imaged twice in succession (with FA ≈ 8-10°), using identical sequence parameters and with no gap between the end of the first image and the start of the second. Measure the SNR at the DC offset of the two images, S0 and S1, count the number of phase encode steps, n, and calculate the flip angle map as follows 14:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65972/65972eq03.jpg      (1.3)",
    "NOTES: Common parameters for in vivo HP 129Xe MRI, as well as a more complicated but highly accurate flip-angle calibration method (multi-shot pulse/acquire experiment), are given in Niedbalski et al.11.\nIn vivo HP 129Xe imaging\n\t\nProvide proper coaching to the subject regarding breath-holding techniques and allow the subject to practice the inhalation procedure using a bag of air before introducing the HP 129Xe bag.\nInstruct the subject to perform a series of breaths in and out with room air, followed by a deep inhalation of HP 129Xe gas, breath-holding, and initiation of the scan (a commonly used method). Closely monitor the subject's chest movement to ensure that breathing remains synchronized with provided instructions.\n\t\tNOTE: Various coaching methods are currently employed for breath-hold procedures, and a future consortium paper will likely establish a consensus statement on this.\nUse nose clips to prevent nasal inhalation of the gas during breath-holding.\nAfter breath-hold imaging, coach subjects to take deep breaths to remove xenon from the lungs and resolve any temporary side effects11.\nFor those pursuing dissolved-phase xenon imaging, be aware that subject inhalation volume likely impacts the acquired dissolved-phase data substantially15.\nData reconstruction and analysis\n\t\nExport 'raw' data from the scanner, typically in the form of a list of complex data in order of readout acquisition.\nFor rectilinearly acquired k-space trajectories, each complex data point corresponds to an integer frequency in two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) k-space. Reconstruct the image using a simple, fast Fourier transform (FFT) for rectilinear trajectories.\nFor non-rectilinear trajectories (e.g., radial or spiral data), perform data 'gridding' to interpolate or convolve complex data into integer bins before the subsequent FFT. Examine the data before performing gridding, if necessary, to ensure accuracy and avoid potential artifacts.",
    "​NOTE: FFT of raw k-space data may yield images similar but not identical to scanner-reconstructed DICOM images since the scanner further corrects reconstructed images based on known non-linearities in gradient behavior. These effects are generally small, but they can be more pronounced at the edges of the scanner imaging volume, especially when large organs like lungs are imaged. It is recommended to use the scanner-reconstructed image (if available) for post-processing.\n2. Troubleshooting steps\nNOTE: While the protocol outlined some quality control (QC) procedures in hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI, troubleshooting may be necessary due to emergent issues, anomalies, and challenges. Any errors or missteps in the process can have a ripple effect, impacting subsequent steps and leading to issues such as missing or low-quality images with low signal intensity, high noise levels, or complete signal loss. To address these challenges, strategic approaches should be employed to identify and investigate the problems in detail.\nHP 129Xe dose bag preparation for QC\n\t\nCarefully brew a precise amount of xenon gas for the control xenon bag, taking note of any nitrogen mixed with it.\nImage the xenon bag in the MRI scanner and conduct accurate polarization measurements before and after the imaging session for reliable comparisons.\nUse the same imaging sequence for all QC scans to facilitate reliable comparisons.\nNote xenon DE values before and after conducting all QC scans to enable future comparisons.\nSystemic noise characterization",
    "Create a control noise profile for QC purposes. Use a specific customized 2D GRE sequence that includes a high field of view (FOV; 400-500 mm) to capture the maximum signal from the area, a high Bandwidth per pixel (the maximum available or at least >50 kHz) to identify nearby noise resonances, and the lowest possible repetition time (TR) and echo time (TE)11,13. Acquire the QC for noise profile using a xenon vest or a loop coil.\nObtain an image with no sample (HP 129Xe) in the coil. This image will characterize the noise profile.\nExamine the acquired noise data, particularly the k-space, for non-Gaussian elements such as spikes, patterns, or discretized/binned values.\nCreate a QQ plot by plotting the acquired real/imaginary data against a synthesized Gaussian dataset (with appropriate random number generation function) with identical mean, standard deviation, and vector length, both ordered from smallest to largest. Deviations from the line y = x in the QQ plot indicate the presence of non-Gaussian components within the acquired data, requiring further investigation. (Figure 4).\n\t\tNOTE: A quantile-quantile plot (QQ plot) can provide insights into whether two datasets exhibit similar distributions. Comparing the data with a normally distributed dataset enables assessment of whether the distribution is Gaussian or not. The protocol assumes that the real and imaginary part of k-space approximates a Gaussian distribution in the absence of a sample.\nIdentify the noise distribution pattern and potential outliers with a suitable plot of choice (use Chauvenet's criterion if necessary16).\nCategorize noise into regular and irregular types based on its characteristics (see steps 2.3 and 2.4).",
    "NOTE: Regular noise involves regularly appearing patterns in the readout or k-space data. Irregular noise appears relatively random and often has high intensity with no discernible timing pattern but does not demonstrate a Gaussian profile like unavoidable thermal noise.\nRegular noise detection\n\t\nTo rule out the scanner as a noise source,acquire images using the standard site protocol with various pulse sequence parameters disabled and electronic components powered off. For example, if a particular gradient coil is emitting noise, the gradients should be powered down prior to running the scan to examine whether the noise resolves.\n\t\tNOTE: Powering down the gradient generally requires elevated access to the scanner console and may require a service engineer to be present. Ultimately, a sequence in which the multinuclear spectrometer is active, but no gradients are powered, and no RF delivered should be sufficient to determine whether a noise issue originates within these components.\nEliminate noise sources from the room and subsequently identify potential origins of regular noise.\n\t\tNOTE: Noise sources may include electronic components like contrast injectors, code buttons, sensors, vital-sign monitors, scanner components (e.g., positioning laser, bed mechanoelectronics, fans, lights), or waveguides between console/magnet walls.\nUse a simple surface loop coil tuned to the 129Xe frequency to 'sniff' around the magnet room for noise sources. Physically place the xenon coil element near potential problematic devices and run a test sequence (see step 2.2.1) to detect amplified noise.\nExamine k-space and image data to pinpoint the exact source of coherence noise.\nIf a specific source is identified, attempt to disable it or cover it with aluminum foil/flashing or a copper mesh to reduce noise.",
    "Rerun the scan after disabling or covering noise sources to see if the noise resolves.Continue this process until all noise sources are eliminated, leaving only low root mean square (RMS) Gaussian noise.\nIrregular noise detection\n\t\nIdentify irregular noise as high signal 'spikes' in individual k-space pixels with abnormally high or low signals in the real or imaginary channels.\n\t\tNOTE: K-space spikes often result in images with stripe or 'corduroy' patterns (Figure 5). The presence of high values or spikes in the k-space data can often lead to the occurrence of a striped pattern in the image space. This phenomenon is frequently associated with gradient-related issues.\nEliminate potential issues with X, Y, or Z gradients by identifying the direction responsible for the striped pattern (Figure 5). Perform imaging in different phase encoding orientations, including anterior to posterior, head to foot, and left to right.\nSystematically examine the resulting images in each orientation to identify which specific gradient direction is contributing to the striped pattern. If needed, contact the site's clinical engineer to selectively enable and disable individual gradients, allowing for the identification of the source of any noise spikes.\nNo signal\n\tNOTE: When encountering a situation where no signal is observed after the acquisition in HPG MRI studies, a systematic troubleshooting approach can be undertaken. Here are some recommendations to address this issue,\n\t\nVerify the xenon coil and connection.\n\t\t\nEnsure that the xenon coil is selected in the MRI scanner and properly connected.\nMovement of the patient during the scan may cause disconnection of the coil, so carefully inspect the coil connection.\nCheck if the door of the MRI scanner is securely closed, as an open door can allow outside RF into the magnet room.",
    "Perform spectroscopy on the xenon phantom (see section 1.4.2) and verify the Xenon peak height and noise floor from the spectroscopy. Use a 90° flip angle to ensure the presence of a xenon peak. Calculate the maximum signal associated with 90° excitation and compare the voltage/power with the QC scan results.\nEvaluate the xenon coil.\n\t\t\nPrepare a small bag of xenon and measure the polarization at the measurement station.\nImage the bag with a simple 2D GRE scan on an HP 129Xe bag with the following parameters: higher flip angle of 90° (adjust the pulse duration if necessary as pulse duration dictates the transmit bandwidth [BW]), use reference voltage based on the previous QC of a phantom, a high FOV and low BW, while keeping the base resolution low.\nMeasure the polarization again at the measurement station. If the polarization does not decrease significantly, it suggests a potential issue with the xenon coil transmitter or amplifier.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The polarization level experiences a gradual decline due to T1 decay throughout this process, irrespective of the success of excitation pulses from the xenon vest coil. Therefore, a high 90° FA is suggested to observe a sufficient polarization decay caused by the excitation pulse to rule out xenon coil transmitter functionality issue. If the polarization decreases significantly, but no signal is detected in the image, a xenon coil receiver issue is indicated.\nComprehensive analysis\n\t\t\nAnalyze both the k-space and image space data to examine any abnormalities or inconsistencies.\nCompare the acquired data with previous scans or reference data to identify potential differences or deviations.\nDiscretization of the data\n\t\nCheck for data discretization (Figure 6).",
    "NOTE: When coil voltages are recorded by the scanner spectrometer, they are amplified to appropriate levels to ensure the full dynamic range of the spectrometer is employed and the highest fidelity is achieved. The signal is discretized temporally according to the readout bandwidth, which is inversely proportional to datapoint dwell time, and the recorded analog voltage values are digitized into discrete signal 'bins' determined by the spectrometer bit depth. Proper amplification of the incoming signal to span the full bit depth requires the user to have provided correct coil voltage/amplification/scaling values. On some scanners, an imaging scan will be disallowed until preparation pulses are performed at the target frequency - a process that must be avoided for hyperpolarized studies as the additional rf will reduce polarization and increase breath hold time. If the spectrometer is improperly calibrated or fails to adequately amplify the signal, the recorded data may be coarsely discretized - only a small percentage of the amplitude bins are populated with digitized data points. Data discretization can also affect the information content by introducing quantization errors and loss of fine detail. Data discretization can also introduce artifacts, compromise SNR, and limit the ability to accurately analyze physiological changes. Importantly, coarse discretization of k-space data may not prohibit the production of a seemingly satisfactory image (Figure 6).\nOptimize the acquisition parameters and employ appropriate reconstruction algorithms to reduce data discretization.\nImprove hardware and utilize techniques like higher sampling rates, advanced interpolation methods, and noise reduction strategies to mitigate the negative effects of data discretization.\nSubscription Required.
