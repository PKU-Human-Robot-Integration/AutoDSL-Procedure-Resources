    "Ethics Statement:\nMouse husbandry and handling are in accordance with UK Home Office regulations and UCL ethics committee guidelines, complying with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 of the United Kingdom and its Amendment Regulations 2012.\nNOTE: All solutions should be made with diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)- treated water to destroy any residual RNase. For DEPC treatment, add DEPC (1 ml per litre), shake vigorously until all the DEPC globules have disappeared then autoclave to degrade the DEPC.\n1. RNA Probe Synthesis\nCAUTION: When handling formamide, wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and use a safety cabinet. Prepare hybridization buffer: DEPC-treated deionized water with 50% (v/v) deionized formamide, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM NaH2PO4, 5 mM Na2HPO4, 0.01 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 1× Denhardt's solution, and 10% w/v dextran sulfate.\nChoose a DNA clone that contains the cDNA sequence of the gene of interest in a plasmid with RNA polymerase promoters. For this example, use a pCMV-SPORT6 clone, IRAVp968C0654D (Genbank accessionBC024934), with T7 and Sp6 RNA polymerase promoters for Aspa (Supplementary Figure 1).\nPrepare linearized plasmid DNA as template.\n\t\nGrow the DNA clone, extract the plasmid with a small-scale plasmid purification kit according to the manufacturer's protocol and sequence with the T7 and Sp6 universal primers.\nDigest 1,020 µg plasmid DNA with a restriction enzyme that cuts at the 5' end of the sense strand of the cDNA. For this example, use 100 unit SalI to digest the pCMV-SPORT6-Aspa plasmid. Incubate for 1.5 hr at 37 oC.\nRun a small aliquot on an agarose gel to check that the plasmid is fully linearized.\nPurify the linearized plasmid using phenol-chloroform.",
    "Add 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate, one volume of 10 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.0) - equilibrated phenol and one volume of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (IAA) (24:1).\nCentrifuge at 16,000 x g for 1 min at RT (20 - 25 °C, RT) and extract upper aqueous phase.\nAdd one volume of chloroform/IAA, centrifuge at 16,000 x g for 1 min and extract upper aqueous phase.\nRepeat step 1.4.3.\nAdd 2 volumes of ethanol and leave at -20oC for 1 hr or O/N.\nCentrifuge at 16,000 x g at 4 °C for 10 min. Discard the supernatant.\nWash the pellet with 70% cold ethanol and re-suspend at approximatively 1 µg cDNA per 2.5 µl in TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 7.5).\nSynthesize the two probes, one labelled with Digoxigenin (DIG) and the other with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC ).\n\t\nSelect the appropriate RNA polymerase to make the anti-sense probe (complementary to the target mRNA). For this example, use T7 RNA polymerase to make Aspa probe.\nPrepare in vitro transcription reaction: add 1 µg of the linearized DNA, 4.0 µl 5 x transcription buffer, 6.0 µl of 100 mM DTT, 2.0 µl of 10x DIG or FITC RNA labelling mix containing dNTPs, 1 µl RNase inhibitor, and 20 - 40 units of RNA polymerase; make the final volume up to 20 µl with DEPC-treated water.\nIncubate at 37 oC for 1.5 hr.\nRun1 µl of the transcription reaction on a 1.0% agarose gel to check that the reaction has worked. The gel should show the linear template and a bright band of the probe.\nMake the volume up to 100 µl with hybridization buffer and store 10 µl aliquots at -80 °C.\n2. Perfusion, Fixation and Tissue Collection",
    "CAUTION: When handling paraformaldehyde (PFA), both solid and aqueous, wear PPE and use a safety cabinet. Prepare formaldehyde solution by dissolving 4% (w/v) PFA into 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution using heat (55 °C). Filter the formaldehyde solution with filter paper.\nPrepare sucrose solution by dissolving 20% (w/v) sucrose in distilled water and add 0.1% (v/v) DEPC solution. Leave O/N at RT with a loose lid and then autoclave.\nTerminally anaesthetize a mouse by intra-peritoneal injection of pentobarbitone (50 mg/kg). Assess the depth of anaesthesia by toe pinch and the absence of withdrawal reflex indicates deep anaesthesia.\nOnce the mouse is under deep anaesthesia, make an incision beneath the rib cage and cut through the rib cage on both sides, lift it to expose the heart.\nInsert a 25-G needle into the left ventricle of the heart. Make a small incision in the right atrium of the heart.\nPerfuse the animal with 20 ml PBS and then 40 ml formaldehyde solution. For P30 and older mice, use a perfusion rate of 12 ml/ min but for younger animals use a lower rate (7 - 10 ml/min).\nDissect the brain.\n\t\nSever the mouse head with surgical scissors by making a cut posterior from the ears. Make a caudal midline incision in the skin and work rostrally to remove the skin from skull.\nStarting from the caudal part, cut through the top of the skull along midline and between the eyes with Iris scissors. Remove the parietal and frontal bone plates by tilting one side of a bone plate each time and snapping it off with tweezers.\nGently tilt the brain upward from the anterior part with tweezers and cut the optic nerves and other cranial nerves. Gently lift the brain out of the skull.",
    "Place the brain into a mouse coronal brain matrix. Slice the brain into 3 approximately 4 mm pieces with a feather razor blade.\nTransfer the slices into 4% PFA solution and incubate O/N at 4 °C.\nTransfer brain slices to DEPC-treated 20% sucrose solution and incubate O/N at 4 °C\nPlace each brain slice into a dry cryomould, surround with optimum cutting temperature (OCT) medium and freeze on dry ice. Store at -80 °C.\n3. Cryosectioning\nCut 15 µm sections of frozen tissue in a cryostat and collect the sections onto microscope slides. If required, wet the sections with DEPC-treated PBS and flatten them with a fine paintbrush.\nLeave the slides to dry for approximately 1 hr to ensure that the tissue adheres to the slide.\n4. Hybridization\nPrepare 65 °C wash buffer: 150 mM NaCl, 15 mM Na3C3H5O(COO)3 (= 1x saline sodium citrate), 50% (v/v) formamide and 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20.\nPrepare MABT buffer: 100 mM maleic acid, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20, pH 7.5.\nDilute the two probes (DIG-labelled and FITC-labelled) 1/1,000 in hybridization buffer pre-warmed to 65 °C and mix well.\nApply around 300 µl of hybridization mixture onto each slide, coverslipwith oven-baked (200 oC) coverslips and incubate O/N at 65 °C in a humidified chamber.\nTransfer the slides into a Coplin jar containing pre-warmed wash buffer. Wash the slides for 30 min twice at 65 °C with wash buffer.\nWash the slides for 10 min three times with MABT at RT.\n5. Visualization of the FITC Probe\nPrepare ISH blocking buffer: MABT with 2% blocking reagent and 10% heat-inactivated sheep serum.\nOptional: use a hydrophobic pen to draw circles around the tissue sections on the slide to reduce the volume of antibody solutions required.",
    "Incubate the slides for 1 hr at RT with ISH blocking buffer in a humidified chamber.\nIncubate the slides O/N at 4 °C with a horseradish peroxidase (POD)- conjugated anti-FITC antibody diluted 1/500 (v/v) in ISH blocking buffer.\nPlace the slides into a Coplin jar containing PBS with 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 (PBST). Wash 3 times for 10 min in PBST and replace with fresh PBST each time.\nImmediately before use, prepare the fluorescent tyramide by diluting 100 times into the Amplification diluent. For this example, use FITC-tyramide.\nAdd this to the slides and leave for 10 min at RT.\nPlace the slides into a Coplin jar and wash 3 times in PBST for 10 min.\n6. Visualization of the DIG Probe\nPrepare 0.1 M Tris- HCl pH 8.2.\nIncubate the slides with ISH blocking buffer for 1 hr at RT.\nIncubate the slides O/N at 4 °C with an alkaline phosphatase (AP) -conjugated anti-DIG antibody diluted 1/1,500 (v/v) in ISH blocking buffer.\nWash with MABT for 10 min three times.\nWash twice with 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.2 for 5 min at RT.\nImmediately before use, prepare Fast Red solution by dissolving the tablets in 0.1 M Tris pH 8.2. Filter the solution through a 0.22 µM filter.\nIncubate the slides at 37 °C with Fast Red solution in a humidified chamber. As the time for optimal development varies, check the slides regularly with a fluorescent microscope to monitor the formation of precipitate. For this example, stop the reaction after 2 - 3 hr.\nWash with PBST for 10 min three times.\n7. Immunohistochemistry\nPrepare IHC blocking buffer: 10% (v/v) serum (of a different species to primary antibody host) in PBST.\nIncubate slides with IHC blocking buffer for 1 hr at RT in a humidified chamber.",
    "Prepare primary antibody: dilute the primary antibody at an appropriate dilution in PBST with 5% serum (of a different species to primary antibody host). For this example, use a rabbit anti-Olig2 antibody at 1/400 (v/v) dilution.\nIncubate in the primary antibody solution at 4 °C O/N.\nWash with PBST for 10 min three times.\nPrepare secondary antibody: dilute a fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody at an appropriate dilution in PBST with 5% (v/v) serum (of a different species to primary antibody host) and 0.1% (v/v) Hoechst 33258. For this example, use a donkey anti-rabbit Alexa647 secondary antibody at 1/1,000 (v/v) dilution.\nIncubate in the secondary antibody solution at RT for 1 hr.\nWash with PBST for 10 min three times.\n8. Mounting\nPartially dry the slides at RT, and mount with a fluorescence mounting medium. Leave the slides to dry and then image in a confocal microscope under 10X, 20X and 63X objectives using 4 different channels with the following excitation wavelengths: 570 nm for Fast Red, 488 nm for FITC, 647 nm for Olig2 immunolabelling and 350 nm for Hoechst.\nSubscription Required.
