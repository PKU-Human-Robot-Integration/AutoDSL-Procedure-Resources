    "pMXs-based retroviral 4-factor system\nDay 1\nPlate Plat-E cells in Plat-E medium at 8×10<sup>6</sup> cells per 10-cm dish. Distribute the cells evenly over the dish.\nDay 2\nIn the evening, transfect Plat-E cells from day 1 \\(cells should be 70-80% confluent and evenly distributed) using the modified calcium phosphate transfection method<sup>1</sup> as follows: \nReplace the medium of the 10-cm dish with 5 ml fresh Plat-E medium.\nFor each factor use one 15 ml tube, add: \n1.  24 μg plasmid\n  2.  1043 μl ddH2O\n  3.  156.25 μl 2M CaCl2\n  4.  1.25 ml 2×HBS\n  Mix vigorously immediately after adding 2×HBS, incubate at room temperature for 3-5 minutes. \n5.  add 2.5 ml Plat-E medium\n  Mix gently and transfer the 5 ml transfection mixture into the dish with 5 ml fresh Plat-E medium.\nRevive OG2 MEFs in MEF medium.\nNote: The condition of the MEFs and passage number are critical factors for successful reprogramming. For this reason, they are plated just before the start of the reprogramming experiment to keep the passage number as low as possible and the proliferation rate high.\nDay 3\nIn the early morning, 8-12 hours after transfection, replace the medium of the transfected Plat-E cells with 10 ml Plat-E medium/10 cm dish.\nDay 4\nIn the morning, split OG2 MEFs at 16,000-20,000 cells/well of P12 plate. Distribute the cells evenly over the well.\nIn the evening, start the first infection as follow:\nHarvest the supernatant of the transfected Plat-E plates using a syringe and filter through a 0.45 μm filter. This is the first viral supernatant. Add fresh Plat-E medium \\(10 ml/10-cm dish) to the transfected Plat-E cells for a second harvest of viral supernatant 24 hours later.",
    "Mix the 4 supernatants of each factor with equal volume, add one volume of fresh Plat-E medium \\(at 1/4 of the total supernatant volume, for example: add 2.5 ml fresh medium for 10 ml supernatant), add polybrene to a final concentration of 4-8 μg/ml. \nReplace the medium of OG2 MEFs with the infection mixture. Use 3 ml infection mixture per well. \nDay 5\nRepeat the infection a second time as in day 4 using the second round of viral supernatant. \nDiscard the Plat-E cell dishes.\nDay 6\nChange the medium of the infected OG2 MEFs to FBS-based ESC medium. Change new ESC medium every other day in the first 3-5 days before cells get confluent and every day afterwards.\nDay 22\n18 days post infection count iPSC colonies that are GFP positive.\nPolycistronic lentiviral 4-factor system\nThe following protocol is based on the publication<sup>2</sup>, with minor modifications.\nDay 1\nPlate HEK293T cells in HEK293T medium \\(the same with Plat-E medium) at 8×10<sup>6</sup> cells/10-cm dish. Distribute the cells evenly over the dish.\nDay 2\nIn the evening, transfect HEK293T cells from day 1 \\(cells should be 80-90% confluent and evenly distributed) as follows:\nReplace the medium of the 10-cm dish with 5 ml fresh HEK293T medium.\nIn a 15 ml tube, add:\n1.  20 μg 4F-IRES-dTomato + 15 μg psPAX2 + 6 μg pMD2.G\n  2.  1043 μl ddH2O\n  3.  156.25 μl 2 M CaCl2\n  4.  1.25 ml 2×HBS\n  Mix vigorously immediately after adding 2×HBS, incubate at room temperature for 3-5 minutes. \n5.  2.5 ml HEK293T medium\n  Transfer the 5-ml transfection mixture into the dish.\nRevive passage 0 MEFs in MEF medium.\nDay 3\nIn the morning, 8-12 hours after transfection, change the medium of the transfected HEK293T cells with 10 ml fresh HEK293T medium.\nDay 4",
    "In the evening, split MEFs at 16,000-20,000 cells/well of P12 plate. Distribute the MEFs evenly over the well.\nHarvest the supernatant of the transfected HEK293T plates using a syringe and filter through a 0.45 μm filter. The virus supernatant can be stored at 4℃ for 3-5 days or in -80℃ for longer time. \nDiscard the HEK293T dishes. \nDay 5\nIn the morning, start the first infection as follow:\nAdd a volume of fresh HEK293T medium at 1:1 ratio of the supernatant volume \\(such as: 10 ml fresh medium for 10 ml supernatant), add the polybrene to a final concentration of 4-8 μg/ml. \nReplace the medium of MEFs with the virus mixture. Use 1 ml infection mixture per P12 well. \n8 hours after infection, change the medium of the infected MEFs to ESC medium. Change new ESC medium every other day in the first 3-5 days before cells get confluent and every day afterwards.\nDay 17\n12 days post infection, wash the cells twice using DPBS, fix the cells using 4% paraformaldehyde in room temperature for 15 minutes, stain the colonies using SSEA1 primary antibody \\(ab#16825, Abcam, 1/100 dilution) and green fluorescence secondary antibody Alexa Fluor® 488 Goat Anti-Mouse IgG \\(#A-11029, Invitrogen, 1/200 dilution), then count the SSEA1+/dTomato- colonies using a fluorescence microscope. \nDoxycycline inducible secondary 4-factor system\nDay 1\nRevive the OG2 secondary MEFs \\(with the doxycycline \\(DOX)-inducible 4F transgenes inserted into Col1a locus<sup>3</sup>) in MEF medium.\nDay 2\nIn the evening, split OG2 secondary MEFs at 16,000-20,000 cells/well of P12 plate. \nDay 3\nIn the early morning, the medium was changed into mouse ESC medium containing 2 μg/ml doxycycline and 50 μg/ml vitamin C. Change new ESC medium every other day in the first 3-5 days before cells get confluent and every day afterwards.\nDay 15",
    "12 days post infection count GFP positive iPSC colonies.\niCD1 medium based Sox2+Oct4 2-factor system\nDay 1 to 5, the same with pMXs-based 4-factor reprogramming system above. Transfect Sox2 and Oct4 only.\nDay 6\nChange the medium of the infected OG2 MEFs to iCD1+BMP4 medium<sup>4</sup>. Change new iCD1+BMP4 medium every other day in the first 3-5 days before cells get confluent and every day afterwards.\nDay 16\n12 days post infection count GFP positive iPSC colonies."
