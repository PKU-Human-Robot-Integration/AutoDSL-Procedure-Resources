ABA-dependent tethering of PML-IV to telomeres induces telomere clustering, enrichment of DDR factors at telomeres and telomere synthesis\n(A) Schematic showing the ABA-induced tethering of PML-IV to telomeres (up). U2OS cells expressing TRF1RFP and PML-IVGFP were treated with DMSO or ABA for 18 h. Fluorescence of PML-IVGFP and TRF1GFP was directly analyzed (down). Scale bar, 5 μm.\n(B) U2OS cells expressing TRF1RFP and PML-IVGFP were exposed to ABA as indicated. Telomeres were detected by FISH, and the numbers of telomere foci (left) in individual cells (n=100) and FISH intensity (right) of individual telomeres (n=2,000) were quantified. Red lines: mean numbers of telomere foci per cell. ∗∗p<0.001, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001, determined by unpaired Student’s t test.\n(C) U2OS cells expressing TRF1RFP and PML-IVGFP were exposed to DMSO or ABA for 14 h. BLM was analyzed by IF, and telomeres were detected by FISH. Representative images showing the enrichment of BLM at telomeres after ABA treatment (left). Scale bar: 5 μm. The numbers of BLM+ telomeres in individual cells (n>100) were quantified (right). Red lines represent the mean number of BLM+ telomeres per cell. ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001, determined by unpaired Student’s t test.",
    "(D) U2OS cells expressing TRF1RFP and PML-IVGFP were treated with DMSO or ABA for 18 h, and then labeled with EdU for 1 h. The EdU and telomeres in non-S phase cells were analyzed by IF and FISH. Representative images showing the induction of telomere synthesis after ABA treatment (left). Scale bar: 5 μm. The numbers of EdU+ telomeres in individual cells (n=61) were quantified (right). Red lines represent the mean number of EdU+ telomeres per cell. ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001, determined by unpaired Student’s t test.\nU2OS cells expressing PYL1-TagRFP-TRF1 and ABI-EGFP-PML-IV are seeded with 1 mL culture medium in coverslips-containing 12-well plates at a confluency of 30%–50% (0.6 × 10ˆ5–1 × 10ˆ5 cells), and cultured for 24 h.\nNote: To monitor the dynamics of telomere clustering, 4 wells of U2OS (0, 4, 8, 12 h) are required. To visualize the proteins or EdU signal at telomeres, 2 wells of U2OS are required.\nNote: If larger culture vessels are desired, scale reagent volumes relative to the vessel surface area (see: https://www.thermofisher.com/au/en/home/references/gibco-cell-culture-basics/cell-culture-protocols/cell-culture-useful-numbers.html[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/au/en/home/references/gibco-cell-culture-basics/cell-culture-protocols/cell-culture-useful-numbers.html] for surface areas of various culture vessels).\nTo monitor the dynamics of telomere clustering, visualize the enrichment of various proteins at telomeres, and telomeric DNA synthesis, treat the cells with 200 μM ABA or DMSO as following.\nTo monitor the dynamics of telomere clustering, treat the cells with 200 μM ABA by adding 1 μL of 200 mM ABA stock solution to 1 mL of cell media, and incubate at 37°C for 4, 8, and 12 h. DMSO is used for ABA no-treated control.\nTo visualize the enrichment of various proteins at telomeres, treat the cells with 1 μL of 200 mM ABA or DMSO for 14 h.",
    "To visualize telomeric DNA synthesis, treat the cells with 1 μL of 200 mM ABA or DMSO for 18 h, and then incubate the cells with 20 μM 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) at 37°C for 1 h by adding 2 μL 10 mM EdU stock solution to 1 mL of cell media.\nDetection of proteins and DNA synthesis in APBs by immunofluorescence (IF)\nTiming: 6 h–1 day\nAPBs enrich numerous DNA repair and replication proteins. BLM is one of the well-known DNA repair factor localized at APBs, and it is critical for ALT telomere DNA synthesis at APBs (Zhang et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). So we use BLM as an example for IF, and we monitor ALT telomeric DNA synthesis by detecting the incorporation of EdU at APBs by IF. The cells on coverslips are subjected to pre-extraction, fixation, permeabilization, and then stained with primary and secondary antibodies for Immunofluorescence (IF).\nCool the plate with cells on ice, rinse once with 1 mL ice-cold 1× phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nTreat cells with 1 mL ice-cold pre-extraction buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.9, 50 mM NaCl, 300 mM sucrose) for 5 min on ice, and then rinse once with 1 mL ice-cold 1× PBS.\nNote: The pre-extraction step helps to remove proteins that are not chromatin-bound.\nCritical: The incubation time of pre-extraction buffer is important. Longer time incubation may lead to weaker IF signal.\nRemove the plate from ice, and fix cells with 0.5 mL 3% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min at 20°C–22°C, and rinse the cells once with 1 mL 1× PBS. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCritical: Freshly prepared or thawed PFA of good quality is important for the experiment.\nNote: PFA is toxic. PFA should always be handled under a fume hood.",
    "Pause point: The fixed cells can be kept in 1× PBS at 4°C up to one week.\nPermeabilize cells in 0.5 mL permeabilization buffer (1×PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100) for 5 min. Rinse cells once with 1 mL 1×PBS. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nIf EdU staining is not detected, go to step 9. For monitoring telomeric DNA synthesis by EdU staining, rinse cells with 0.5 mL PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Prepare click-iT reaction reagents as following. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1871_9.csv\nCritical: The Click-iT reaction mixture should always be prepared freshly and used immediately.\nImmediately incubate coverslips with 25 μL reaction mixture on parafilm, with the cell-carrying side facing down. The incubation is done at 20°C–22°C in the dark for 0.5 h.\nNote: Steps 7 and 8 is only required for detecting EdU signal in cells. Through the click-iT reaction, biotin is covalently conjugated to EdU. Thus, in the following steps, the signal of EdU can be detected with anti-biotin antibody.\nNote: To keep coverslips moisturized, it is recommended to put the coverslips on parafilm in a covered container with wet filter paper or a humidified black box.\nCritical: Make sure to remove the residual buffer on coverslips before incubation. Keep the incubation time same for each coverslip.\nCritical: It is important to keep the samples protected from light during incubations.\nIncubate cells in freshly prepared 0.5 mL blocking solution (1× PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 and 3% BSA) at 20°C–22°C for 1 h. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nIncubation with primary antibody against target proteins. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nDilute the primary anti-BLM antibody (for detecting BLM, 1:1000) or anti-biotin antibody (for detecting EdU click it-reacted with Azide-biotin, 1:1000) in blocking solution (the dilution factor for different antibodies should be optimized by titration, 25 μL for each sample).",
    "Place parafilm in a flat container and put 25 μL diluted antibody solution on parafilm for each coverslip.\nPick up the coverslips from 12-well plates, and remove the remanent buffer on the coverslips by tapping them on filter paper.\nOverlay the coverslips on the antibody solution with the cell-carrying side facing down.\nIncubate at 20°C–22°C for 2 h or at 4°C for 12 h–24 h.\nNote: Place wet filter paper in the container to prevent drying.\nNote: BLM is a protein that accumulates at telomeres in ALT+ cells. Anti-biotin antibody is used to detect the EdU conjugated with biotin by click-iT reaction. An anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to 594 will be used to visualize BLM and biotin.\nPause point: The coverslips can be incubated with primary antibody for 24 h.\nMove coverslips back into 12-well plates containing 1 mL PBST (1× PBS containing 0.05% Tween- 20) in each well.\nNote: Make sure that the cell-carrying side of coverslips faces up.\nWash coverslips three times (5 min each) with 1 mL PBST (1× PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20) under gentle agitation.\nIncubate coverslips with anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to 594 fluorophores (Alexa Fluor® 594 AffiniPure Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L), 1:500) in the blocking solution for 1 h in dark at 20°C–22°C. For the incubation with secondary antibody, repeat steps 10b–d.\nMove the coverslips back into 12-well plates, and wash the coverslips three times (5 min each) with 1 mL PBST (1× PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20).\nCritical: For all the steps after the incubation with secondary antibody, it is important to shield the samples from light.\nDetection of telomeres by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)\nTiming: 6 h–1 day\nThe cells on coverslips are fixed again, dehydrated and hybridized with a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probe of telomeres.",
    "Fix cells again with 0.5 mL 3% PFA at 20°C–22°C for 15 min. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCritical: This fixation step is important for maintaining the IF signal.\nDehydrate cells in 0.5 mL 70%, 85%, and 100% ethanol for 2 min each. Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nTake coverslips out of 12-well plates and put them on the covers of 12-well plates to air dry completely.\nNote: Use the inner side of covers, and don’t let coverslips to lie completely flat (otherwise it will be difficult to separate coverslips from the cover after drying). Keep the 12-well plates for subsequent washing steps.\nPrepare the hybridizing solution (70% formamide, 2× SSC, 2 mg/mL BSA, 10% dextran sulfate) freshly as following. 10 μL hybridizing solution is required for each sample. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1871_10.csv\nNote: Formamide is toxic, should always be handled under a fume hood.\nFor each sample, mix 0.2 μL of 5 μM PNA telomere probe (TelC-FITC, F1009, PNA BIO) in 10 μL hybridization buffer to a final concentration of 100 nM. Vortex and centrifuge at 1000 g for 30 s.\nNote: TelG probe can also be used as alternative.\nCritical: It’s important to prepare a master mix for the same batch of samples.\nHeat up the hybridizing solution containing PNA probe at 85°C for 2 min. Meanwhile, prewarm the coverslips and slides (75 × 25 mm) at 85°C on a metal heat block for 2 min. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCritical: Preheating the coverslip and PNA probe is critical for minimizing the background.\nAdd 10 μL the hybridization solution with PNA probe to each coverslip. Cover the coverslip with a prewarmed slide quickly, and make sure the hybridization solution is evenly distributed between coverslip and slide.\nHeat the slide with the coverslip for 10 min at 85°C on a metal heat block. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] and 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].",
    "Note: To heat the slide with even temperature, it will be better to invert the cube of heat block, and let the flat surface up.\nCritical: make sure to heat the slides that need to be compared for exactly the same time.\nPlace the slide in a closed container at 20°C–22°C for 2 h–24 h for hybridization. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: Put wet filter paper in the container to prevent drying. keep the container in dark.\nCritical: Longer incubation time gives brighter FISH signal.\nPause point: The coverslips can be incubated with hybridization solution with PNA probe for 24 h.\nImmerse coverslips in wash solution 1 (2× SSC, 70% formamide), and then put coverslip back to the 12-well plate.\nWash coverslips with 1 mL wash solution 1 (2× SSC, 70% formamide) three times for 5 min each. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nWash coverslips with 1 mL wash solution 2 (2× SSC, 0.1% Tween-20) three times for 5 min each. During the second wash, cells were stained with 1 μg/mL DAPI for 5 min.\nPrepare the slides for microscope with 6 μL VECTASHIELD Antifade mounting medium, and seal the slides with nail polish.\nThe images were captured with a Nikon 90i microscope (objective:60×; channels: DAPI, 488, 594; No z-stack). Adjust the exposure time of each channel to make sure the signal not saturated. Same imaging parameters must be used for the samples to be compared.\nNote: Other widefield or confocal fluorescence microscope can be used as alternatives.\nNote: Z-stack analysis of 3D images is a more accurate method to analyze colocalization, and it can be used to obtain additional information of the spatial organization of proteins in APBs.",
    "Note: Since the fluorescence of PYL1-TagRFP-TRF1 and ABI-EGFP-PML-IV is largely abolished during the dehydration and hybridization steps, the fluorescence signals of 594 and FITC can be detected without interference from GFP and RFP. Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCritical: The samples need to be compared should be imaged together with the same imaging parameters, to make sure all the conditions are the same."
