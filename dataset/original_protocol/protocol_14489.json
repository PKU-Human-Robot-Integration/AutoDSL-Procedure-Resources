  "procedures": [
    "This study has been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Massachusetts General Hospital. Obtain appropriate institutional approval for this animal study before beginning. Some techniques might have to be adjusted according to local IACUC requirements.\n1. GFP-PTX Mice\nObtain PTHcre+ mice and Rosa-mTmG mice at 8 - 10 weeks old for further mating.\nBackcross the PTHcre+ mice (mixed 129;FVB background) with C57BL/6 mice for 6 generations to obtain mice with C57BL/6 background.\nInbreed PTHcre+ mice to obtain PTHcre+/+ mice17.\n\tNOTE: To perform genotyping, extract the DNA from the tip of the tail and use it for PCR. The PCR primers to check for heterozygosity and homozygosity of the PTHcre transgene are as follows: forward primer A, CCTGTCAAGGATGTGGAAGA, reverse primer A', TCAGATCACACCACACAGCA, forward primer B, CAGTTGTCTTTAGTTTACTCAGCATCAG, reverse primer B', GATAATCGCGAACATCTTCAGGTT17.\nCross PTHcre+/+ mice16 with Rosa-mTmG mice18. Wean PTHcre;mTmG pups when 4 weeks old.\nAnesthetize 8 - 10 weeks old PTHcre;mTmG mice by i.p. injection of tribromoethanol (Avertin) at 0.6 mg/g body weight, or other agents such as ketamine/xylazine. Use buprenorphine 0.1 mg/kg s.c. every 12 h as an analgesic for 48 h after surgery according to an approved protocol.  Ensure appropriate depth of anesthesia by the toe pinch withdrawal reflex or other means. Place the animal in the supine position.\nExtend and prepare the ventral neck region by shaving the skin using single edge blades. Disinfect the shaved skin with a povidone iodine antiseptic pad.\nCover the animal with sterile surgical drapes to reduce contamination of the surgical site and use autoclaved microsurgical instruments for the surgical procedure.\nCut a 2 cm longitudinal incision in the skin with a surgical scalpel. Dissect fascia and push the salivary glands to the side by blunt dissection with curved serrated forceps.",
    "Under the dissection microscope using halogen light and a 4 - 5X magnification, cut and separate the paratracheal muscles using sharp forceps tips and expose the trachea.\nIdentify the thyroid gland with the right and left lobe located next to the trachea.\nSwitch the light source to fluorescent light and visualize the two green-fluorescing parathyroid glands.\n\tNOTE: Typically, the two parathyroid glands are located at or near the surface of the thyroid glands, but occasionally, they are located further away.\nCarefully remove the green parathyroid glands using surgical forceps and scissor. Use sterile gauze for hemostasis and carefully check along the trachea to ensure that all green tissue has been removed.\nClose the paratracheal muscles by interrupted suture using 6-0 polyglactin 910 sutures. Close the skin incision by Halsted suture using 6-0 polyglactin 910 sutures.\nOptional: Inject 10 µL/g body weight sterile normal 0.9% sodium chloride solution to the mice for fluid replacement.\nPlace postsurgical animals to a separate cage on a warm incubator (37 °C) for body temperature recovery. Once the mice are awake and in the recumbent position, put pellet chow and water with some gelatin food on the cage floor.\nAfter a postsurgical observation period of 2 h, return mouse to the animal facility and follow local requirements for postsurgical care.\n3 days after parathyroidectomy, obtain 10 µL tail blood and measure blood ionized Ca++ using an analyzer such as the blood gas system Ca++/pH analyzer. Successful parathyroidectomy results in blood ionized Ca++ equal or lower than -2SD of sham-operated control mice (1.20 mmol/L in our experiments of n = 30).\n2. PTH-cre-iDTR Mice\nObtain PTHcre+ and DTRfl/fl mice at 8 - 10 weeks old for mating.\nBackcross the PTHcre mice (mixed 129;FVB background) with C57BL/6 mice for 6 generations to obtain mice with C57BL/6 background.",
    "Inbreed the PTHcre+ (C57BL/6 background) mice to obtain PTHcre+/+ mice17.\n\tNOTE: To perform genotyping, DNA from mice tail tips was extracted and used for PCR. Genotyping Primers: forward primer A, CCTGTCAAGGATGTGGAAGA, reverse primer A', TCAGATCACACCACACAGCA, forward primer B, CAGTTGTCTTTAGTTTACTCAGCATCAG, reverse primer B', GATAATCGCGAACATCTTCAGGTT17.\nMate PTHcre+/+ mice16 with DTRfl/fl mice19 to obtain PTHcre-iDTR mice.\nPrepare DT solution by diluting diphtheria toxin powder with sterile saline to a concentration of 0.5 µg/mL. Sterile filter, and store aliquots at -80 °C.\nChoose 8 - 10 weeks old PTHcre-iDTR mice for injection experiment. Thaw DT aliquot to room temperature, administer DT intraperitoneally at 5 µg/kg (10 µL/g) bodyweight of the animal. For maximal efficiency and least toxicity, DT administration is repeated for a total of 2 injections in a 3-day interval17.\n3 days after the second injection, take 10 µL tail blood from each PTHcre-iDTR/PTHcre-iDTR-mTmG mouse and measure blood Ca++ using a Blood Gas System Ca++/pH analyzer.\n\tNOTE: We define mice with blood ionized Ca++ lower than 1.18 mmol/L as hypoparathyroid mice, which equals 2SD below the mean of vehicle-injected control mice (n = 22)."
