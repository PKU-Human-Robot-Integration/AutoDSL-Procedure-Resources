    "Preparation of matrigel-coated plates for 2D smNPC cell cultureNote: Before the final coating step, all plasticware and solutions containing matrigel must be kept on ice to prevent premature gelation during handling. Dilute matrigel 1:100 in cold (4°C) KnockOut DMEM/F-12Note: We recommend keeping a frozen stock of 1:4 diluted matrigel in KnockOut DMEM/F-12 and further diluting this 1:25 in KnockOut DMEM/F-12 immediately before use. Quickly add 1 ml 1:100 matrigel solution per well of a 6-well plate to cover the entire bottom of the well. Distribute the solution evenly across the surface of the well by gently rocking the plate. If you imagine a coordinate system with the XY plane parallel to the ground, first tilt the plate along the Y-axis about ten degrees in either direction 5 times, then tilt the plate along the X-axis about ten degrees in either direction 5 times or until the entire plate bottom is covered by matrigel solution. Seal the plate with Parafilm to prevent evaporation.Incubate at room temperature overnight. It is possible to store the plates at 4°C for approximately 2 weeks.Note: If plates are needed on the same day, it is also possible to incubate them at 37°C for 3 h and use them immediately. smNPC cultureNote: Generally, smNPCs are seeded and cultured in 2 ml medium per well in 6-well plates. As the cells become more confluent, carefully monitor the cell culture medium. If the pH indicator shows acidification (i.e., the commonly used phenol red will turn yellow), refresh medium every day and / or increase media volume by 50-100% up to 4 ml per well. Figure 1 includes examples of smNPC cultures at different stages as a reference.",
    "Prepare smNPC medium (see Recipes, Table 2) from basal medium (see Recipes, Table 1) and prewarm it to 37°C in a water bath. Small molecules should be added to the medium immediately before use. Avoid heat-cycling the medium once reconstituted.Aspirate old medium.Add 1 ml accutase per well of a 6-well plate and incubate at 37°C for 10-15 min (check after 7-8 min whether cells are detached). Cells should detach without mechanical agitation.Resuspend the cells 2-3 times as gently as possible using a 1,000 μl manual pipette to maximize cell harvest and to disperse small remaining aggregates. Transfer suspension into a tube with 6 ml split medium (see Recipes, Table 6) to dilute and inactivate accutase.Centrifuge for 2 min at 220 × g.Aspirate the supernatant. Take care not to aspirate the pellet.Resuspend the pellet in smNPC medium and seed the cells at a ratio of approximately 1:10-1:20 (depending on cell line and experience).Note: Aspirate the supernatant from the matrigel-coated wells before adding the cell solution. Distribute cells evenly across the surface of the well by gently rocking the plate in an XY-motion (see Step A2). Avoid swirling/circular motions as these tend to concentrate the cells in the center of the well. Place plate into a 37°C CO2 incubator.Exchange medium every other day and maintain cells until they reach approximately 90-100% confluence before splitting them again/using them for organoid generation.

    "Partially differentiated cultures may be rescued by maintaining high splitting ratios (at least 1:20) over several passages, as smNPCs usually proliferate faster than differentiated cells. These types of culture should not be used for generating organoids. (d) smNPCs at the optimal confluence for organoid generation or splitting.Organoid generation and maintenanceNote: See Figure 2 for representative brightfield images of organoids at different ages. Day 0 Detach smNPCs from the matrigel-coated cell culture plate using accutase as described in Steps B3 and B4.Collect cells in split medium (see Recipes, Table 6), count them, and transfer the appropriate number of cells (see note below) to a new Falcon tube. Then spin them down at 220 × g for 2 min.Note on cell numbers and volumes: Seeding requires 9,000 cells in 150 μl medium per well of a 96-well plate. This is equivalent to: 9,000 cells/0.15 ml = 60,000 cells/ml. Thus, prepare the cell suspension at a concentration of 60,000 cells/ml. Make sure to prepare 10-20% surplus volume of the cell suspension to account for pipetting inaccuracies/dead volume. Resuspend the pellet in the appropriate amount of aggregation medium (see Recipes, Table 3).Note: Step 4 and all following feeding steps can be done either by hand or using the automated liquid handling system (ALHS)/pipetting robot. Seed 9,000 cells in 150 μl aggregation medium per well of a 96-well V-bottomed plate and incubate at 37°C 5% CO2 for 48 h.Day 2 Note: All media changes involving organoids should be performed carefully to avoid damaging the samples or accidentally removing them from the wells. To facilitate manual media aspiration, we recommend slightly tilting the plate and performing all liquid handling by pipetting (not by vacuum pumps or similar devices).",
    "Leave a small amount of old medium (≤ 10 μl) in the well so as to not damage the organoids by extensive direct contact with a pipet tip. A small number of organoids (< ca. 50) can be handled with standard single channel mechanical pipets. For larger numbers of samples (more than half a 96-well plate), we recommend using multichannel pipets (in our experience, a standard mechanical pipet with 200-μl capacity works well). Finally, further scale-up for high-throughput applications makes it feasible to use a pipetting robot / automated liquid handler. The same precautions as for manual handling apply – it is advisable to leave a small amount of old medium (≤ 10 μl) per well rather than damage organoids by more ambitious removal of liquids. While dependent on the exact setup, here, dead volumes are generally higher than for manual pipetting, and we advise preparing 5-10 ml surplus of all liquids. Replace medium with 150 μl patterning medium per well (see Recipes, Table 4).Day 4 Replace medium with 150 μl patterning medium per well.Day 6 Replace medium with 150 μl maturation medium plus activin A per well (see Recipes, Table 5).Day 8 + X Replace medium with 150 μl maturation medium (same as day 6 without activin A) per well.Feed aggregates every 2 days with the same medium until they reach the desired age for analysis/follow-up experiments.Note: Maturation dynamics vary from cell line to cell line and need to be tested empirically by immunostaining or qPCR. Generally, organoids contain a large number of MAP2+ neurons by day 30. Glial cells including GFAP+ astrocytes arise later, around day 40 onward. For more details, please refer to the detailed analyses in our previous publication (Renner et al., 2020). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4049/bioprotoc-11-11-4049-g002.jpgFigure 2.

    "Seeded on day 0 as a single cell smNPC suspension, cells aggregate to a spherical shape within one day. Over time, they maintain their homogeneous round shape and grow in size.Note: Sometimes a few dead cells can be found at the bottom of the well (especially at earlier stages. Here, see day 15). As long as the aggregates themselves maintain their structure, this is not an issue. The dead cells will be washed away during the next feeding procedure."
