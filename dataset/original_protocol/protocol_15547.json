    "All experimental procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Bundang Hospital. For the experiments in this study, 34 participants with stroke were recruited. Signed informed consent was obtained from all participants. A signed informed consent was obtained from a legal representative if a participant met the criteria but could not sign the consent form because of disability.\n1. Experimental setup\nPatient recruitment\n\t\nPerform the screening process using the following inclusion criteria:\n\t\tAged 18 to 85 years with the presence of impaired upper limb functions;\n\t\tFirst-ever ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke confirmed by brain computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging;\n\t\tParticipant's ability to follow the instructions for clinical assessment and the EEG study;\n\t\tAbsence of a history of any other psychiatric or neurological diseases except stroke.\nExclude patients based on the following:\n\t\tPrevious disease involving the central nervous system (e.g., traumatic brain injury, brain tumor, Parkinson's disease);\n\t\tInability to wear the EEG cap; and\n\t\tInability to follow the instructions for the clinical assessment and the EEG study.\n\t\tNOTE: The inclusion and exclusion criteria were chosen to select the participants capable of participating in the experiment and to regulate the demographic factors that could influence the results.\nProvide all recruited participants with information about the details of the experimental procedure.\nExperimental system: EEG\n\t\nUse an EEG system consisting of 32 Ag/AgCl scalp electrodes, a textile EEG cap, and EEG recording software for data recording.\nUse a personal computer (PC) with EEG recording software installed and connect the PC to the EEG device via Bluetooth.\nUse another PC with a numerical analysis and programming software application for engineering (see Table of Materials).\nFor stimuli presentation, connect the PC to a dedicated trigger box (Figure 1).",
    "NOTE: The detailed specifications of the two PCs are provided in Table of Materials.\nExperimental paradigm based on programming software\n\t​NOTE: The participants performed a hand extension task using the affected and unaffected hands, during which EEG data were measured. Figure 2 shows the experimental paradigm of this study.\n\t\nPresent two visual stimuli, CLOSE and OPEN, for 30 s each, on the center of a monitor to measure baseline resting-state EEG data, during which the participant closes and opens the eyes.\n\t\tNOTE: Because resting-state EEG data are relatively less contaminated by unwanted physiological artifacts, they are useful for verifying the quality of EEG data and identifying individual EEG characteristics with respect to the resting state.\nPresent a hand motion image for 3 s to instruct the participant to make a hand extension movement, followed by a fixation mark for 5 s for resting.\n\t\t​NOTE: This procedure was regarded as a trial and was repeated 10 times in a single session. Each participant underwent 4 sessions for each hand. The participant had a break whenever he/she wanted after performing each session to prevent excessive fatigue.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64753/64753fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Schematic of the equipment setup. A PC (PC1) presenting experimental stimuli was connected to a trigger box, and another PC (PC2) was connected to an EEG amplifier. Stimulation events generated in PC1 were delivered to the EEG amplifier via the trigger box connected to PC1.

    "Figure 2: Experimental paradigm used in this study. A single trial consisted of a hand extension movement of 3 s followed by a relaxation of 5 s. This pattern was repeated 10 times in a single session. A total of eight sessions were performed; four sessions involved affected hand movement, while the other four involved unaffected hand movement.This figure was adapted from Shim et al.17 with permission from Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

Recording movement-related EEG data\nEEG setup\n\t\nSeat the participant in a comfortable armchair in front of a monitor.\n\t\tNOTE: The distance between the participant and the monitor should be at least 60 cm to prevent eye fatigue. However, an excessive distance should be avoided (e.g., >150 cm) because it could distract the participant's concentration.\nTo accurately wear the cap for EEG measurement, define the Cz location based on the international 10-20 system using the intersection of the longitudinal line connecting the nasion and inion and the transverse line connecting the upper part of both auricles.\n\t\tNOTE: An EEG cap may not be required depending on the EEG measurement equipment. In such case, EEG electrodes are directly attached to the scalp according to the international 10-20 system15.\nFor an accurate EEG measurement, use an appropriately sized EEG cap according to the head size of the participant and place it so that the Cz electrode position is placed on the individual Cz location.",
    "Fix the chin strap with appropriate tightness; this will prevent the participant from being uncomfortable during swallowing and blinking in the experiment. After that, confirm that the T9 and T10 electrode positions of the EEG cap are in the temporal region above both auricles, and the Fpz electrode position of the EEG cap is located in the middle of the forehead.\n\t\tNOTE: If those electrodes are out of the designated location, consider changing the cap. Three EEG cap sizes were used in our study (54 cm: small, 56 cm: medium, 58 cm: large).\nAfter correctly placing the EEG cap, attach 32 Ag/AgCl scalp electrodes on the scalp according to the extended international 10-10 system, with the ground and reference electrodes at Fpz and FCz, respectively16.\n\t\tNOTE: The location of the reference electrode (FCz) is relatively less influenced by various physiological artifacts, such as those from electrooculography, electromyography, and electrocardiography, because it is located around the central area (Cz) of the scalp.\nAdjust the impedance level between the EEG electrodes and the scalp using conductive gel, and fix the hair with the gel to prevent any obstruction between the EEG electrodes and the scalp.\n\t\t​NOTE: It is important to confirm whether any bridge between adjacent EEG electrodes is created due to gel leakage.\nUse the software for EEG recording.\nTurn on the EEG system and execute Configuration > Select Amplifier. Choose Liveamp > > amplifier > connect. Search for Liveamp function for the wireless connection (Figure 3).\nExecute the Impedance check function to monitor the impedance level for each electrode.\n\t\tNOTE: Conducting the experiment with an impedance level of <20 KΩ is recommended (Figure 4).\nExecute the monitoring function to confirm whether the EEGs of all electrodes have similar amplitude levels through real-time EEG signal monitoring (Figure 5).",
    "NOTE: The amplitude of the EEG signal is generally between 10 µV and 100 µV, and the alpha (8-12 Hz) power increases around the occipital area when the eyes are closed. Therefore, the quality of EEG data can be qualitatively confirmed by monitoring the amplitude level and alpha oscillations on the channels around the occipital area while the eyes are closed.\nParadigm setup\n\t\nFor stable EEG data acquisition, use two separate PCs for presenting external stimuli and recording EEG data (see Figure 1).\nTo present experimental stimuli to the participants, create a stimulation program based on the experimental paradigm using programming software (introduced in step 1.3).\n\t\tNOTE: A software-based stimulation program was created in this study, but other software can be used depending on their compatibility with the EEG equipment used for the experiment as well as user convenience. The programming software-based stimulus script is provided in Supplementary File 1 (Experimental_stimulus.m). The event information, indicating the onset point of stimuli, is generated by the in-house programming software, transmitted to the EEG amplifier via the trigger box, and ultimately to the EEG recording software (Figure 1).\nExecute the program presenting the experimental stimuli in monitoring mode (refer to sub step 2.1.10). Subsequently, confirm that the event information is correctly marked in a timely manner at the bottom of the EEG recording software each time a stimulus is presented, as shown in Figure 6.\n\t\tNOTE: Information on the time point is recorded whenever a new stimulus is presented and is subsequently used for data segmentation. Therefore, it is important to obtain the exact time points of experimental events as much as possible to prevent inaccurate data segmentation, which would lead to unreliable results in the analysis.",
    "Initiate the EEG recording software, then independently run the stimulus presentation program developed based on the experimental paradigm using programming software to prevent the data omission.\n\t\t​NOTE: For convenience of data analysis, creating file names with a consistent rule for data storage (e.g., Sub1_Session1) is recommended.\nEEG recording\n\t\nMeasure EEG at a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz following the experimental paradigm introduced in step 1.3.\n\t\tNOTE: The sampling rate can be changed depending on the range of EEG frequencies the researcher wants to investigate. It is generally recommended to use a sampling rate of >200 Hz where EEG information can be investigated at ≤100 Hz based on the Nyquist theorem. This is because most EEG information exists below 100 Hz.\nMaintain the same experimental environments (e.g., experimental place, equipment, room temperature, etc.) as much as possible between the participants and instruct them to minimize unnecessary movements during the EEG measurement.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64753/64753fig03.jpg\nFigure 3: Wireless connection procedure between an EEG amplifier and PC with the EEG recording software.

EEG data analysis\nNOTE: This study provides precise guidelines for replicating the research concept. Therefore, it provides a brief outline of the analysis process and representative results. The detailed processes and the associated results can be found in a previous study17. This serves as an indication that Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. has granted permission for the use of copyrighted material.\nPreprocessing\n\t\nRemove eye-related artifacts from the raw EEG data using mathematical procedures based on principal component analysis implemented in EEG data preprocessing software18,19 (see Table of Materials).\n\t\tNOTE: If any epoch displayed prominent artifacts (± 100 µV), even after preprocessing in any of the electrodes, it was excluded from further analysis. The average number of rejected epochs, including their standard deviation, was 3.69 ± 7.15 for the affected hand-movement task and 1.62 ± 3.95 for the unaffected hand-movement task.\nApply a bandpass filter between 0.1 Hz and 55 Hz. Segment the preprocessed EEG data from -1 s to 3.5 s for each trial based on the task onset to contain the baseline period used for event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) and functional network analyses.\nERSP analysis\n\t​NOTE: The measured EEG data were validated via ERSP analysis for a low-beta frequency band (12-20 Hz) associated with voluntary movements.\n\t\nConduct a short-time Fourier transform for each trial to calculate EEG spectral powers, for which the newtimef function of the EEGLAB toolbox in the programming software was used20 (a non-overlapping Hanning window, 250 ms window size).",
    "Normalize the power spectrum of each trial by subtracting the average power of the baseline period (-1 to 0 s) to investigate the changes in spectral powers between the hand movement task and the baseline period.\nEstimate baseline-normalized ERSP maps for each patient by averaging the normalized power spectra across trials.\nFunctional network analysis\n\t​NOTE: A functional network analysis was conducted to investigate EEG changes from a brain network perspective. To compute weighted whole-brain network indices based on graph theory, brain connectivity between different regions was computed first using the phase locking value (PLV). A functional connectivity matrix was then computed using the results of the PLV-based connectivity analysis, which was subsequently used to compute whole-brain network indices17. All functional network analyses were performed using the programming software.\n\t\nCalculate the Hilbert transform-based phase locking value (PLV) for a low-beta frequency band (12-20 Hz) using an in-house function21,22. The in-house function for computing the Hilbert Transform-based PLV is provided in Supplementary File 2 (myPLV.m).\nAssess the PLVs between all possible pairs of the 32 EEG electrodes at each time point during the task periods (0-3.5 s) and create a symmetric adjacency matrix (32 x 32, number of electrodes = 32) by averaging the PLVs over the task period. Use the PLV matrix as input data for network analysis17,23.\nEvaluate four weighted global-level network indices based on graph theory using the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet): (1) strength, (2) clustering coefficient, (3) path length, and (4) small-worldness17,24,25.\nSubscription Required.
