    "Platelet Lysate (PL) is obtained as previously described in compliance with institutional guidelines3 using fresh buffy coats provided by the IdISBa Biobank as starting material. Their use for the current project was approved by its Ethics Committee (IB 1995/12 BIO).\n1. EVs isolation from PL\nLarger bodies removal\n\t\nThaw PL at room temperature.\nCentrifuge PL at 1,500 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. Discard the pellet as it contains cell debris.\nCollect the supernatant and perform two consecutive centrifugations at 10,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The pellet corresponds to larger EVs such as microvesicles, and in this case, it is discarded.\nFilter the supernatant first through 0.8 µm porous membrane, and then through 0.2 µm porous membrane.\n\t\tNOTE: These steps remove all non-desired EVs.\nPool the filtered PL and store at -20 °C until use.\nSize exclusion chromatography\n\t\nEquilibrate the column coupled to chromatography equipment at the desired flow rate with filtered PBS.\n\t\tNOTE: The flow rate used depends on the column characteristics; in this case, it is set to 0.5 mL/min.\nLoad the processed PL (5 mL) with a syringe to the equipment.\nInject the PL into the column and start collecting 5 mL fractions in 15 mL tubes.\nCollect the EVs enriched fractions and store them at -80 °C until use.\n\t\t​NOTE: When performing the experiment for the first time, characterize all fractions by protein quantification and immunodetection to determine the one enriched with EVs3,11. In this experiment, the 9th fraction is collected.\nWash the chromatographic column with 30 mL of 0.2% NaOH solution and store it in 20% ethanol solution once it reaches equilibrium.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62781/62781fig01.jpg",
    "Figure 1: Schematic diagram of Platelet Lysate (PL) extracellular vesicle (EVs) isolation. PL is centrifuged first at 1,500 x g, and then at 10,000 x g to remove larger bodies. The supernatant is filtered through 0.8 and 0.2 µm filters. Processed PL is loaded onto the column, and EVs are separated by size exclusion chromatography.

EVs characterization\nNOTE: EVs characterization is necessary to perform functional studies12. Electron microscopy or western blot characterization have previously been reported13. This report will focus on the essential characterization techniques for Ti surface functionalization.\nNanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA)\n\t\nDilute the EVs (1:1000) in 0.2 µm filtered PBS.\n\t\tNOTE: Too concentrated samples or too diluted samples will be out of range for NTA determination, and adjustment will be required.\nLoad 1 mL of the diluted EVs with a syringe to the NTA equipment and inject them into the NTA equipment.\nFollow the manufacturer's protocol for particle concentration and size distribution determination.\nProtein concentration\n\t\nDetermine the concentration using 1 µL of the EVs solution. Measure the absorbance with a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 280 nm.\n\t\tNOTE: EVs should present low levels of proteins compared to the number of particles.\nFollow the manufacturer's instructions to obtain the absorbance reading using the spectrophotometer.\n3. Titanium surface functionalization\nNOTE: In this method, machined titanium discs, c.p. grade IV, 6.2 mm diameter, and 2 mm height, are used. The discs may be manipulated with Ti tweezers, but it is important not to scratch the surface. Moreover, the machined side must face upwards during the entire process.\nTi discs wash",
    "NOTE: The volume of solutions used for Ti washing should be enough to cover Ti discs. Place Ti discs in a glass beaker and pour solutions onto them. Then, remove the solution by decanting.\n\t\nWash Ti implants with deionized (DI) water, and then discard the water.\nWash Ti implants with ethanol 70%, and then decant to remove the solution.\nPlace the implants in DI water and sonicate at 50 °C for 5 min. Discard the water.\nIncubate Ti implants in a 40% NaOH solution at 50 °C for 10 min with agitation. Discard the solution.\n\t\tCAUTION: NaOH solution warms during preparation. The solution is corrosive and should be used inside a fume hood.\nSonicate the implants in DI water at 50 °C for 5 min, and then remove the water.\nPerform several washes with DI water (at least 5) until it reaches to neutral pH. Check pH with pH indicators.\nSonicate the implants in DI water at 50 °C for 5 min and remove the water.\nIncubate Ti implants in a 50% HNO3 solution at 50 °C for 10 min with agitation. Remove the solution.\n\t\tCAUTION: HNO3 is a corrosive and oxidizer substance, and it should be used inside a fume hood.\nSonicate the implants in DI water at 50 °C for 5 min. Remove the water.\nPerform several washes with DI water (at least 5) until neutral pH is obtained. Check the pH with pH indicators.\nSonicate the implants in DI water at 50 °C for 5 min. Remove the water.\n\t\tNOTE: At this point, the experiment can be stopped by storing Ti implants in a 70% ethanol solution.\nTi passivation",
    "NOTE: Ti passivation steps are performed by completely covering Ti discs with the different solutions in the order listed below. Ti discs are placed in a glass beaker and solutions are gently poured on them. Volumes used in all wash steps must completely cover the implants and are removed via decanting.\n\t\nIncubate the Ti implants in a 30% HNO3 solution for 30 min at room temperature under gentle agitation. Remove the solution.\nPerform several washes with DI water (at least 5) until it reaches to neutral pH. Check the pH with pH indicators.\nIncubate Ti implants overnight at room temperature in DI water.\nDry off the implants under vacuum conditions at 40 °C for 10 min.\nEVs drop casting\n\tNOTE: For cell functional studies, it is important to work in a cell culture cabinet.\n\t\nPlace the Ti implants in a 96-well plate, with the machined side facing up.\n\t\tNOTE: If the implants are turned upside-down, a needle can be used to set them back.\nThaw the EVs solution and mix them with agitation. Use a vortex to pulse for 3 s.\nDeposit the EVs on the Ti surface. In this study, drops of 40 µL of EVs solution are placed onto the Ti to immobilize a maximum of 4 x 1011 EVs per implant according to the concentration determined by NTA.\nPlace the plates containing the Ti under vacuum conditions at 37 °C until drops are completely dry (~2 h).\n\t\t​NOTE: Adjust the time depending on the number of implants and the water present in the vacuum chamber.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62781/62781fig02.jpg",
    "Figure 2: Schematic diagram of Ti passivation and EVs functionalization by drop casting. Ti implants are passivated first by incubation for 30 min in a 30% HNO3 solution at room temperature. After several washes with DI water, pH reaches neutral. Then, Ti implants are incubated overnight at room temperature in DI water. After that, the implants are dried off under vacuum conditions at 40 °C. For EVs immobilization, 40 µL of EVs solution are deposited onto Ti implants. Next, implants are incubated at vacuum for 2 h until EVs are physically bound to the surface.

Ti surface characterization\nRelease study\n\t\nIncubate Ti surface with 200 µL of filtered PBS at 37 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: PBS is filtered to avoid interferences with the NTA measurement.\nReplace the PBS at different time points and store at -80 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: In this study, 2-, 6-, 10-, and 14-days' time points were analyzed.\nAnalyze stored PBS for particle studies by NTA according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\t\tNOTE: Particle concentration in PBS at different times is a representation of EVs release profile over time.\nBiocompatibility studies\n\tNOTE: Human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSC) are obtained from the IdISBa Biobank in compliance with institutional guidelines.\n\t\nMaintain hUC-MSC in DMEM low glucose supplemented with 20% FBS until use. Change the medium twice per week.\nFor cell seeding, wash the cells in flasks with 5 mL of PBS twice.\nTrypsinize hUC-MSC by adding 1 mL of trypsin solution. Ensure that it completely covers the monolayer of cells. Remove the trypsin solution and place the cell culture flask at 37 °C for 2 min approximately. View cell detachment under the microscope. Detached cells will appear round in shape and will be in suspension.",
    "Resuspend cells in DMEM low glucose with 1% EVs depleted FBS.\n\t\tNOTE: Prepare media supplemented with 1% FBS, and then ultracentrifuge at 120,000 x g for 18 h to remove FBS-EVs. It is important to remove EVs to avoid interferences with platelet EVs.\nDetermine cell concentration by counting the number of cells with a Neubauer chamber14.\nBring hUC-MSC to a concentration of 50,000 cells/mL.\nSeed 200 µL of the cell solution onto the Ti implants.\nAfter 48 h, collect 50 µL of media and perform the cytotoxic determination using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity kit, according to the manufacturer's protocol.\nSubscription Required.
