    "1. Preparation of Bacterial Nanocellulose (BNC)\nNote: All of the steps are performed under aseptic conditions, unless otherwise indicated.\nPrepare culture medium.\n\t\nPrepare 500 ml of liquid culture medium by combining 25 g of yeast extract, 15 g of peptone, 125.0 g of mannitol, and 500 ml of high purity water. Autoclave this mixture at 120 °C for 20 min and store at 4 °C.\nPrepare 100 ml of semisolid media by adding 15 g of agar to 5.0 g of yeast extract, 3.0 g of peptone, 25.0 g of mannitol, and 100 ml of high purity water. Autoclave this mixture at 120 °C for 20 min. Once autoclaved, deposit 5 ml of the mixture in a 90 mm x 16 mm plastic Petri dish. Allow the solution to gel at 4 °C and store at this temperature until further use.\nRehydrate G. xylinus strain preserved in freeze-dried vials by adding 1 ml of liquid culture medium and pipetting up and down, as indicated by the manufacturer's instructions.\nInoculate the Petri dishes containing semisolid media with small droplets of bacterial suspension using an inoculating loop. Make sure that the inoculum covers the entire Petri dish by moving the loop in a zig zag direction from the edge to the center of the dish.\nIncubate the Petri dishes at 26 °C for 72 hr in an incubator without CO2. Once the incubation period is complete, small white colonies are visible. If the colonies are not immediately used, store the Petri dishes at 4 °C by sealing the lid with Parafilm and placing the dishes upside down. The colonies can be stored in that way for up to 6 months.",
    "Transfer 2 ml of the liquid culture medium prepared in step (1.1.1) into each well of a 24-well tissue culture plate. Take two colonies with an inoculating needle from the inoculated Petri dishes in step (1.3) and place them into the first well of the tissue culture plate. Repeat the same procedure for the remaining 23 wells.\nIncubate the tissue culture plate at 30 °C for 7 days. This will yield a total of 24 BNC pellicles with diameter of 16 mm and a thickness of approximately 2-3 mm diameter as depicted in Figure 1.\n\tNote: Do not disturb the bacterial culture at any point during incubation period, for example by shaking the plates. During the incubation period, G. xylinus extrudes glucopyranose sugar molecules to form a polymeric crystalline mesh in the air-liquid interface, which adopts the shape and size of the flask under static cultivation conditions. This polymeric matrix, known as bacterial nanocellulose (BNC), is conspicuous at end of the incubation period.\nCollect the BNC pellicles from the growth media and sterilize them in 200 ml of 1% NaOH solution for 1 hr at 50 °C, in order to remove all traces of G. xylinus. Optionally, stir this solution at 300 rpm using a magnetic bar and a stirring plate. Discard the NaOH solution and add 200 ml of freshly prepared 1% NaOH solution. Repeat the same process once more or until the BNC pellicles in solution acquires a translucent appearance.\nRinse the BNC pellicles with water three times and store them in high purity water at RT. Make sure the BNC pellicles are completely submerged in the water and are not allowed to dry at any time.\nAutoclave the BNC pellicles at 121 °C for 20 min.",
    "Note: An in vivo subcutaneous study in the rat performed by Märtson and coworkers showed non-degradation signs of the BNC after 60 weeks implantation. Indeed, BNC is degradable in nature by microbial and fungal enzymes, which are absent in mammals. On the other hand, the biodegradability of the BNC can be the result of mechanical, chemical, and biological processes that weaken the microfibril network in vivo4.\n2. Synthesis of Polymer-coated Iron Oxide Nanoparticles and Its Deposition in a Bacterial Nanocellulose Membrane\nBubble 1,000 ml of high purity water with nitrogen gas in order to remove any dissolved oxygen in the water and replace it with nitrogen.\nUse a three-neck round bottom flask to prepare a solution in a 2:1 molar ratio of iron(III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O) and iron(II) chloride tetrahydrate (FeCl2·4H2O) diluted with the deoxygenated high purity water. For example, use 5.4 g of FeCl3·6H2O and 1.98 g of FeCl2·4H2O in 10 ml of deoxygenated high purity water. If this preparation turns too viscous and difficult to stir, use 0.54 g of FeCl3·6H2O and 0.198 g of FeCl2·4H2O in 20 ml of deoxygenated high purity water.\n\tNote: Reduce the exposure time of the FeCl2·4H2O to air by weighing this chemical compound as fast as possible. Once introduced in the three-neck round bottom flask, close the three-neck round bottom flask with septum stoppers until it is connected to the nitrogen gas supply and the condenser tube.\nUse two necks of the vessel to provide a constant entrance and output of nitrogen gas by connecting the nitrogen gas supply to a needle punched in a septum stopper and fixed to the vessel's necks.",
    "Place 1 BNC pellicle which was prepared previously in step 1.5 (15.6 mm of diameter and 2-3 mm of thickness) in the vessel with the reactants. Make sure the sample is completely submerged in the liquid.\nConnect the remaining neck of the vessel to a condenser tube. Additionally, use a drying tube filled with anhydrous calcium sulfate on top of the condenser tube. Run water through the condenser tube.\nSeal all of the glass joints with vacuum grease.\nHeat the solution in a silicone oil bath to 80 °C using a stirring hotplate and hold this temperature until step 2.10. Use a small magnetic stir bar to mix the reactants at 350 rpm for 5 min. Make sure the BNC is appropriately impregnated with the ferrous solution and the reactants are completely dissolved. Keep stirring the mixture until the end of the experiment.\n\tNote: Utilize a thermometer to verify the temperature of the silicone oil. It should be stable to 80 °C.\nIncrease the stirring velocity to 700 rpm and add (by dropping), in a time interval of 5 min, 5 ml of ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH, 14%) to the 10 ml of ferrous solution using a pipetting needle, which has been also punched in a septum stopper. After addition of the ammonium hydroxide, the color of the solution changes from yellow/orange to black.\nContinue stirring the solution at 80 °C for another 5 min. Avoid high-speed stirrings in order to maintain the integrity of the sample. High speeds, i.e., higher than 1,000 rpm, can destroy the sample.\nLower the temperature of the solution to 30 °C using the temperature control bottom of the stirring hotplate and keep stirring for another 5 min. Then, turn off the hot plate. At this point, the IONP have been incorporated into the BNC mesh.",
    "Cool the mixture down to RT and separate the magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) and BNC using a strong permanent magnet (e.g., 1 Tesla). To do this, transfer the mixture to a vessel flask and then, while keeping the magnet close to the vessel, hold the MNPs and the BNC in place while decanting the supernatant.\n\tNote: Be careful when handling strong magnets since they can be harmful when used incorrectly. For steps (2.12)-(2.14) and (2.16) use the deoxygenated high purity water prepared previously in (2.1) to prevent particles from oxidation.\nResuspend the MNPs and BNC in 100 ml water. Gently shake the solution to remove all the MNPs that are not strongly incorporated into the BNC. Decant the supernatant again by holding the MNPs and the BNC in place using the magnet.\nWash the MNPs and the BNC several times with water until the supernatant reaches neutral pH (pH~7), as measured using a colorimetric strip.\nSeparate the magnetic-functionalized BNC or magnetic bacterial nanocellulose (MBNC) from the MNPs using tweezers and rinse the MBNC several times with water until the water runs clear.\nSterilize the MBNC by exposing the MBNC O/N to UV (110-280 nm).\nAutoclave 500 ml of deoxygenated high purity water at 120 °C for 20 min and store the MBNC in 20 ml of this water.\nAseptically, immerse the sample in 1% of PEG and stir for 2 hr at RT (37 °C). This procedure improves the biocompatibility and stability of the iron oxide nanoparticles deposited in the BNC, specifically those exposed at the surface5-7. The PEG coating will be distributed over the MBNC 3D network.",
    "Note: Naked IONP are easily oxidized in air because of their high chemical activity8. Even though PEG is considered a non-biodegradable material, its chemical stability depends on the applied biological conditions such as water content, pH, temperature, presence of enzymes, reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species, and others9.\n3. Characterization of the BNC and MBNC Pellicles\nMechanical properties\nPerform normal loading and unloading nanoindentation test using a Berkovich indenter. The radius of Berkovich diamond indenter is 20 nm.\nUse fused silica and tungsten to calibrate contact area as a function of indentation depth at RT. During the test, mount the samples on the indentation using glue. The indenter approached the samples in its thickness direction.\nRandomly select indentation locations on samples surfaces. Keep the spacing between 2 indents between 200-300 mm.\nApply the load to the samples in steps and record the corresponding displacement of the indenter. Analyze the plot of load vs depth to find the Young's modulus.\nCarry out the nanoindentation test of the samples in the presence of deionized water (DI water), and test by applying load rates between 0.0001 mN/sec and 0.005 mN/sec, with peak load between 0.01 mN and 0.60 mN.\nUse a liquid cell and keep samples under the liquids environment. This unique setup for nanomechanical characterization immersed in a fluid environment is ideal to effectively simulate the reach biomechanical functionality of BNC and MBNC membranes.\nStructural Characterization by SEM\nCharacterize the nanocellulose fiber structure by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).\nLyophilize the samples for 24 hr at -80 °C. Then mount on SEM studs, sputter with Au-Pd film for 10 sec and analyze using SEM.\nTakes images at a magnification of 22,000X and 60,000X, with an acceleration voltage of 5 kV.\nMagnetic domains",
    "Allow the MBNC pellicles to completely dry at RT, and subsequently expose for 5 min to a permanent magnet (1 Tesla).\nImmediately, carry out the magnetic force measurements using a bio-AFM according to manufacturer's protocol.\nFor each measurement, capture first the topography features and acquire the magnetic domains during a second pass. Obtain both measurements with the bio-AFM in non-contact mode.\nMagnetic characterization of the nanoparticles is conducted using vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) in the physical property measurements system (PPMS) of Quantum Design, at RT (300 K), with a magnetic field in the range of -10,000 to 10,000 Oe.\nCytocompatibility\nSeed human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) in a 6-well tissue culture plate at a density of 1.0x103 cells/cm2 and incubate for 24 hr in the presence of the test samples: BNC and MBNC pellicles (each with a 15.6 mm of diameter).\nUse populations of untreated and hydrogen peroxide treated cells as negative and positive controls, respectively.\nPerform the Comet assay according to manufacturer's protocols and the guidelines suggested by A. Azqueta & A.R. Collins10.\nUse the nucleic acid dye SYBR Gold in this assay to intercalate and fluorescently label the DNA contained in the electrophoresed samples according to manufacturer's protocol.\n\t\tNote: Cells that do not undergo any DNA damage in the presence of BNC and MBNC samples, will show a fluorescent round green nucleoid, whereas DNA damaged cells will have long comets - positive samples will have nucleoids (the head of the comet) followed by tails which contain fragmented DNA material (percentage of DNA in the tail).\nSubscription Required.
