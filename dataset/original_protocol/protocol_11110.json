  "procedures": [
    "All procedures described here are approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n1. Animals and housing\nHouse 10-week-old male C57BL/6J mice 4-to-a-cage in standard housing conditions (standard microisolator cage, 70 °F room temperature (RT), food and water ad libitum, 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle).\n2. PTSD-induction\nTrauma session\n\t\nPrepare the fear conditioning equipment and chamber.\n\t\t\nProgram the trauma protocol in the fear conditioning software. Set a total time to 5100 s (85 min). Add white light from Time 0 s - Time 5,100 s. Add fourteen 1 s currents at a random inter-trial interval (ITI). Adjust the current to 1.0 mA.\nWipe down all interior surfaces of each fear conditioning chamber with 1% acetic acid solution.\nTurn the light of the procedure room out and turn on a lamp equipped with a red-light bulb to light the room.\nTransport the animals to be assayed directly to the procedure room under an opaque covering.\nAllow the animals to acclimate to the procedure room for 30 min in the dark with 65 db(A) white noise.\nPlace each animal into a fear conditioning chamber, make sure the chamber is latched, and start the protocol using the fear conditioning software.\nWhen the protocol has finished, remove the animals from the fear conditioning chambers and return them to their cage. If additional cages of animals are to be assayed on the same day, transport the trauma-exposed animals to a recovery room separate from the home cage room to prevent traumatized animals from communicating information to the trauma-naïve animals.\nClean the interior of the fear conditioning chambers with 70% ethanol. If additional animals are to be assayed, clean the interior of the chamber with 1% acetic acid and repeat the protocol until all animals have been assayed.\nTrigger session",
    "Program the trigger protocol. Set the total time to 300 s (5 min). Add 1 s currents at times 60 s, 120 s, 180 s, 240 s, and 300 s. Adjust the current to 0.7 mA.\nInstall A-frame plexiglass inserts into the fear conditioning chamber and wipe down all the interior surfaces with 10% ethanol. Place a white noise machine into each sound-attenuating cubicle and adjust sound output to 70 dB(A).\nTransport the animals uncovered to the fear conditioning procedure room via an indirect route, which takes longer than the direct route taken for the trauma session.\nAllow animals to acclimate to the fear conditioning room for 30 min.\nPlace each animal into a fear conditioning chamber, turn on the white noise machine, and start the protocol.\nWhen the protocol has finished, remove the animals from the fear conditioning chambers and return them to their cage.\nClean the interior of the fear conditioning chambers with 70% ethanol. If additional animals are to be assayed, clean the chamber interior with 10% ethanol. If no additional animals are to be assayed, clean the chamber interior with 70% ethanol.\n3. Behavioral assessment\nDark/light transfer\n\t\nArrange the light/dark transfer box under the ceiling-mounted camera. Zoom in the camera until the light/dark box fills the field of view and adjust the focus such that the image is clear. Place a piece of opaque plastic over the doorway connecting the light and dark arenas.\n\t\t\nDefine the light arena and risk assessment area (a 1-inch x 3-inch area directly outside the door in the light arena) in the movement tracking software.\nAdjust the lighting in the bright arena to 1,000-1,100 lux.\nTransport the animals to the procedure room and allow the animals to acclimate for 30 min.",
    "Place each animal into the dark arena and replace the lid. Remove the doorway separating the light and dark chambers and record the animal's movement for 5 min.\nRemove the animal from the apparatus and clean all surfaces with 70% ethanol.\nCalculate the % risk assessment for each animal by dividing the time spent in the Risk Assessment Area by the total time spent in Light Arena.\nReturn all the animals to their home cages. Clean the light/dark box thoroughly with 70% ethanol.\nMarble burying test\n\t\nPerform the marble-burying test in a standard rat microisolator cage or similar enclosure. Fill each cage with 5 cm fresh bedding. Arrange the cages on the bench of the procedure room and adjust the lights to <10 lux.\nArrange 20 clean black glass marbles in an evenly spaced 5 x 4 grid across the bottom of each cage.\nTransfer the animals to the marble-burying procedure room to allow the animals to acclimate for 30 min.\nPlace each animal into a marble-burying arena for 25 min. After 25 min, remove each mouse from its arena and return it to its cage.\nCalculate the % of marbles buried by dividing the number of buried marbles by 20.\nAcoustic startle response\n\t\nDefine the startle, no stimulus, and prepulse startle trials in the startle response software.\n\t\t\nDefine the 120 dB(A) startle stimulus to emit a 40 ms tone of 120 dB(A) while measuring startle amplitude.\nDefine the 75 dB(A), 80 dB(A), and 85 dB(A) prepulse stimuli to emit either a 40 ms tone of 75 dB(A), 80 dB(A), or 85 dB(A), respectively, followed by a 40 ms tone of 120 dB(A) while measuring the startle amplitude.\nDefine the no startle stimulus to emit a 40 ms tone of 65 dB(A) (background) while measuring startle amplitude.",
    "Define the acoustic startle response session.\n\t\t\nSet the background to the analog level correlating to 65 db(A).\nAdd seven 120 db(A) startle trials at the beginning of the session, followed by an additional ten 120 db(A) startle trials randomly interspersed with twelve no stimulus trials, twelve 75 db(A) prepulse trials, twelve 80 db(A) prepulse trials, and twelve 85 db(A) prepulse trials, followed by a final seven 120 db(A) startle stimuli.\nTransfer the animals to a room adjacent to the acoustic startle response procedure room and allow the animals to acclimate for 30 min.\nFollowing the 30 min acclimation, transfer the animals to be assessed to the procedure room in the dark.\nPlace each animal into the restrainer in the acoustic startle unit, replace the inserts to restrain each animal, and close the door of the sound-attenuating cubicle. Ensure that the inserts are positioned such that the animal is centered over the vibration sensor but is still able to turn around freely.\nStart the protocol using the startle response software.\nWhen the protocol concludes, remove all the animals from the acoustic startle apparatus to the transfer cage.\nClean the animal restrainer by thoroughly wiping down the interior surfaces with 70% ethanol.\nCalculate latency to peak startle the amplitude by averaging the time to max velocity values for all 120 dB(A) startle stimuli for each animal.",
    "Calculate the % prepulse inhibition. Calculate the average Vmax value for 120 dB(A) startle stimuli, no startle, 75 dB(A) startle stimuli, 80 db(A) startle stimuli, and 85 dB(A) startle stimuli. Calculate the net average startle amplitude by subtracting the average Vmax for no startle stimuli from the average Vmax for 120 dB(A). Calculate the % prepulse inhibition for the 75 db(A), 80 dB(A), and 85 dB(A) prepulse startles by dividing each average prepulse Vmax by the average 120 dB(A) Vmax, subtracting that ratio from 1 and multiplying by 100. Calculate the average % pre-pulse inhibition by averaging the 75 dB(A), 80 dB(A), and 85 db(A) % pre-pulse inhibitions.\nHome cage activity\n\t\nPerform the home cage activity in microisolator cages with modified lids fitted with passive infrared sensors which detect animal movement. Replace the standard water bottles with 50 mL conical tubes fitted with a stopper sipper to reduce the area of the cage bottom obstructed from the view of the motion sensor. Place a limited amount of food (50-75 g) into the wire cage insert to reduce obstruction of the motion sensor.\nTransport the animals to the home cage activity room following the acoustic startle response test.\nPlace each animal into a modified microisolator cage and ensure that the IR sensor is reading movement. Replace the wire cage top and lid.\nCheck the animals daily over the course of the assay to ensure each animal has sufficient access to both food and water.\nHouse the animals in the home cage activity cages for 3 light/dark cycles (72 h).\nFollowing the 72 h period, stop the recording and remove all the animals from their home cages.",
    "Calculate the % light phase activity by dividing the total number of activity bouts during the second and third light phases by the total number of activity bouts of the last 48 h of monitoring.\nScoring and inclusion\n\t\nCalculate the Z value for % risk assessment, % marbles buried, average % prepulse inhibition, latency to peak startle amplitude, and % light phase activity readout for each animal by subtracting the mean value for that behavioral test in that cohort and then dividing by the standard deviation of that behavioral test in that cohort.\nAward points to the top 20% most PTSD-like animals for each behavioral readout. The top 20% of animals displaying the lowest % risk assessment, highest % marbles buried, lowest average % prepulse inhibition, lowest latency to peak startle amplitude, and highest % light phase activity, receive 3, 1, 2, 3, and 1 points respectively (Table 1).\nAdd all of the points received by each animal in the behavioral tests. Designate the animals receiving 5 points or more as PTSD-like, and designate the animals receiving 0 points as resilient.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
