    "9. Select the format of the output file. Available options for download are JSON, OWL, and OBO formats. OBO and OWL formats correspond to the Biomedical Ontology and Web Ontology Language, respectively.\nThe downloadable output files described here are the same obtainable with the DisProt REST API, described in detail in the Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.484#cpz1484-prot-0003].",
    "DisProt can be accessed programmatically via REST API to retrieve a single entry (or region) and to perform large-scale database searches. DisProt API documentation (https://disprot.org/api[href=https://disprot.org/api]) is available as a Swagger representation that follows OpenAPI specifications.\nAll API endpoints are available from https://disprot.org/api/[href=https://disprot.org/api/]{endpoint_name}. In this support protocol we introduce three different endpoints—the first one can be used to retrieve a single entry, the other two to search entries in the database.\nNecessary Resources\nHardware\nLaptop or desktop computer. An active and stable internet connection is required.\nSoftware\nPython 3.5+, Requests Python library 2.23+\nInput data\nNo input data are required\n1. Get a single entity.\nUsers can retrieve a single entity, i.e., a protein entry or one of its manually curated regions, by using its corresponding identifier. The following syntax must be used to retrieve a single entity from DisProt disprot.org/api/{identifier}, where the “identifier” must be a valid DisProt ID, DisProt region ID, or UniProt accession. The query is customizable with various parameters, e.g., file format and release. Here we provide two pieces of code to retrieve a single entry in JSON format written on the standard output (Sample code 1) and write a file in FASTA format (Sample code 2). In Sample code 2 the API version of DisProt is also specified.\nSample code 1\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport requests\ndisprot_id = \"DP00086\"\nurl = \"https://disprot.org/api/\" + disprot_id\nresp_json = requests.get(url).json()\nprint(resp_json)\nSample code 2\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport requests\ndisprot_id = \"DP00086\"\nparams = {\n'format':'fasta',\n}\nurl = \"https://disprot.org/api/\" + disprot_id\nresp_fasta = requests.get(url, params=params).text\nf = open(\"DP00086.fasta\", \"w\")\nf.write(resp_fasta)\nf.close()\n2. Results.",
    "DisProt currently provides three output formats: JSON (default), FASTA, and TSV. Due to the inherent limitations of the FASTA and TSV file formats, the JSON format renders the most comprehensive description of intrinsic disorder. The TSV and FASTA files provide details about regions or different types of consensus.\nSearching entries in DisProt database\n3. Performing a text search.\nDisProt provides an extensively customizable search engine. It is possible to perform a free text search or formulate complex queries against combined fields, e.g., organism and UniRef50. The search query is sent to https://disprot.org/api/search[href=https://disprot.org/api/search] with URL parameters. Note that whitespace and other special characters must be converted into a valid ASCII format; the space is usually replaced with %20. Multiple search fields can be combined in the same query by joining them with an AND operator (& symbol), e.g., disprot.org/api/search?organism=homo%20sapiens&name=kinase returns all the human proteins with “kinase” in the protein name. Given that some fields are interpreted as regular expressions, it is also possible to use the OR operator (| symbol). This is the case with the following query, e.g., https://disprot.org/api/search?organism=homo%20sapiens|mus%20musculus, which returns both human and mouse entries. The user can choose to customize the output format. Currently available output formats are JSON, FASTA, and TSV. By default, the endpoint returns the results in JSON; however, users can select another format using the “format” field in the parameters or headers. It is possible to use an older version of the API for legacy reasons by specifying accept-version in the URL header of a request. By default, the server responds with the latest version of the API.\nSample code\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport requests\nparameters= {\n'ncbi_taxon_id':'9606',\n'format':'tsv'\n}\nurl = \"https://disprot.org/api/search\"\nresp_tsv = requests.get(url, params=parameters).text\nprint(resp_tsv)\n4. Results.",
    "DisProt returns an object with “data” and “size” fields. “Data” contains a list of entries, and these entry objects are the same described in the previous section. “Size” corresponds to the number of matched entries. Note that when the pagination parameters are provided, only the data field is affected, whereas the size field always refers to the full query result.\nSequence Similarity Searches in DisProt Database\n5. Performing a sequence similarity search.\nThe users can also perform a BLAST sequence similarity search against the database with a POST request to https://disprot.org/api/blast[href=https://disprot.org/api/blast].\nSample code\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport requests\ndata = {\n'seq':'KKPLDGEYFTLQIRGRERFEMFRELNEALELKDAQAGKEPGGSRAHSSHLKSKKGQSTSR',\n}\nurl = \"https://disprot.org/api/blast\"\nresp_json = requests.post(url, data=data).json()\nprint(resp_json)\n6. Results.\nThe output provided is the same as that available for the text search described above, i.e., JSON (by default), TSV, or FASTA. In addition, DisProt returns the corresponding “Bit-score”, “E-value”, “Identity”, and “Coverage”, as provided by BLAST.",
    "The ontologies adopted in DisProt are available at https://disprot.org/ontology[href=https://disprot.org/ontology]. DisProt relies on three ontologies to provide structured annotations of IDRs: (i) the IDPontology (IDPO) to describe structural states, transitions, and disorder-associated functions, (ii) the Gene Ontology (GO) to describe functional aspects of an IDP/IDR, (iii) the Evidence and Conclusion Ontology (ECO) to describe the methods used to assess the presence of disorder or one of its associated aspects. From the Ontology page (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.484#cpz1484-fig-0005]), users can explore the available ontology terms used in DisProt.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/98a82ac8-1719-4196-843a-49658fa11bb3/cpz1484-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nOntology page.

The Intrinsically Disordered Proteins Ontology (IDPO) features three disorder-related branches, i.e., structural state, structural transitions, and disorder function.\n4. Users can explore the IDPO terms by using the filter option or, alternatively, by opening the ontology branch of interest and looking for the available child terms.\n5. By typing in the “Filter” box an IDPO term, such as flexible linker/spacer and hitting the “Search” button, users will visualize the definition of the term and its parent term entropic chain.\n6. Clicking on the IDPO identifier in brackets, users will be redirected to the dedicated IDPontology page of that term (https://disprot.org/idpo/IDPO:00502[href=https://disprot.org/idpo/IDPO:00502]). Each IDPontology page is divided in two sections (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.484#cpz1484-fig-0006]):",
    "The first section describes the information about that specific term, i.e., Identifier (IDPO:00502), Name (flexible linker/spacer), Definition (unstructured region connecting, providing separation, and permitting movement between adjacent functional regions, e.g., structured domains or disordered motifs), and its parent term, Is a (entropic chain, IDPO:00501).\nThe second section lists all the available DisProt entries with at least one piece of evidence annotated using that term, e.g., DP00018.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/24b7206c-a0bf-47d8-a402-7ea799f5c1df/cpz1484-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\nIDPontology term page: the “flexible linker/spacer” example.\nExploring the Gene Ontology (GO) terms\n7.

    "Here, we present a use case, the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleoprotein (DisProt entry: DP03212), to explain how to visualize and interpret a DisProt entry page and its annotations. The SARS-CoV-2 Nucleoprotein entry, also shown among the SARS-CoV-2 home page examples, has been recently released (DisProt release 2021_12) and currently includes more than 30 pieces of evidence annotated from nine scientific articles. The SARS-CoV-2 Nucleoprotein is characterized by the presence of three intrinsically disordered regions, i.e., the N- and C-termini (Cubuk et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.484#cpz1484-bib-0006]; Schiavina, Pontoriero, Uversky, Felli, & Pierattelli, 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.484#cpz1484-bib-0024]) and a flexible linker that connects the RNA-binding domain (RBD) with the dimerization domain (Cubuk et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.484#cpz1484-bib-0006]; Schiavina et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.484#cpz1484-bib-0024]). The N-terminal IDR plays a role in phase separation (Perdikari et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.484#cpz1484-bib-0019]), and a deletion of the flexible linker has been associated with a reduction of turbidity and of LLPS-associated droplet formation (Perdikari et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.484#cpz1484-bib-0019]), while the C-terminus appears to be involved in droplet formation and in contributing to the protein RNA-binding activity (Wu et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.484#cpz1484-bib-0032]). Overall, up to 50% of the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleoprotein consists of disordered regions. Interestingly, Nucleoprotein mutation hotspots cluster in disordered regions: 89% of mutations occurring in the 12 major variants of SARS-CoV-2 map to these IDRs, while in the Omicron variant and its lineages (BA.1 and BA.2), all the mutated positions localize in unstructured regions (Quaglia et al., 2022b[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.484#cpz1484-bib-0023]).",
    "DisProt entries are annotated by biocurators that collect all experimental evidence related to disorder available from a publication. In DisProt, an entry corresponds to a protein isoform, and each IDR annotation is an evidence about its flexible nature or function. The minimal information required to annotate a region in DisProt include reference to the publication (PMID or a DOI); the boundaries of the region (start and end position on the amino acid sequence); the Evidence and Conclusion Ontology (ECO) term that defines the experimental technique and the type of information, i.e., an IDPontology term (structural state, structural transition, disorder-derived functions); or a Gene Ontology term defining a molecular function, biological process, or cellular component associated with the annotated IDRs. To support annotations, curators report authors’ statements as snippets of text from the corresponding publication. Finally, a selected team of reviewers carefully check all annotations, to ensure a high-quality standard. Each entry page consists of two main sections. The first provides information about the protein and includes a feature viewer to visualize DisProt region annotations on the sequence. The second section lists all annotations in a tabular format.\nNecessary Resources\nHardware\nWhile DisProt works best on laptop or desktop computers, it is also easily accessible from smartphones and tablets.

The feature viewer, which can be expanded and collapsed, allows users to visualize regions’ annotations on the sequence (Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.484#cpz1484-fig-0007]). By default, two tracks are shown, the first showing DisProt annotations and the other including domain data as defined by Pfam (El-Gebali et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.484#cpz1484-bib-0012]), which provides conserved domain families, and Gene3D (Lewis et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.484#cpz1484-bib-0016]), which provides globular domains. It is possible to expand the feature viewer to visualize the sub-tracks and each disorder evidence annotated for a specific structural or functional aspect. By hovering each region on the sequence viewer, a tooltip provides additional information such as annotated terms, identifiers, cross-references, the name of the curator who annotated the region, the experimental method, and the reference supporting that annotation.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4bdcb641-b4a8-4e10-8974-b708c20643aa/cpz1484-fig-0007-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 7\nSARS-CoV-2 Nucleoprotein entry page in DisProt. Entry information, feature viewer, sequence viewer, and all the features described in steps 1-6 of Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.484#cpz1484-prot-0005] are shown.\n5. Users can open (“toggle”) the sequence viewer, which dynamically highlights amino acids of the selected IDR directly on the protein sequence.\n6. It is also possible to select a subset of annotations using the “Filter” box under the sequence viewer.",
    "The bottom section of the entry page lists all the DisProt annotations. Among them, the N-terminal disordered tail of Nucleoprotein is described in evidence DP03212r009, while the C-terminal IDR is represented in evidence DP03212r011. The Nucleoprotein entry includes pieces of evidence annotated both with disorder-related functions (IDPontology) and with Gene Ontology terms. The unstructured linker–evidence DP03212r019 (Fig. 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.484#cpz1484-fig-0008])–has also associated the corresponding disorder-related function from the IDPontology, flexible linker/spacer (pieces of evidence DP03212r008 and DP03212r017). The functions of the disordered C-terminus, instead, are described with specific Gene Ontology terms, e.g., protein homodimerization activity (evidence DP03212r030), RNA stem-loop binding (DP03212r034), and molecular condensate scaffold activity (evidence DP03212r035).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/663246dc-014f-4824-b54c-ec5ef700d48b/cpz1484-fig-0008-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 8\nStructural state evidence, DP03212r019, describing the flexible linker of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleoprotein."
