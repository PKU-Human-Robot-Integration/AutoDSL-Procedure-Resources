    "All experimental procedures were approved by the University of Virginia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\nNote: Figure 1 shows a schematic overview of the experimental procedures.\n1. Preparation of Oocytes\nPre-prime X. laevis females with 150 U of Pregnant Mare Serum Gonadotropin (PMSG) approximately one week in advance of oocyte isolation. Inject 1 ml 150 U/ml PMSG into dorsal lymph sac with 1 cc sterile syringe with 29 G needle.\nPrepare solutions for oocyte injection and oocyte-animal cap assay.\n\t\nPrepare Ca++/Mg++-free OR2 (OR2-): 82 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.5 mM Na2HPO4, 50 mM HEPES pH 7.2.\nPrepare OR2: OR2- plus 1 mM CaCl2 and 1 mM MgCl2.\nPrepare OCM: 60% Leibovitz L15, 0.4 mg/ml BSA, 100 μg/ml Gentamycin, pH 7.8.\nPrepare 1x MBS: 88 mM NaCl, 1 mM KCl, 0.7 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.8), 2.5 mM NaHCO3.\nPrepare 3% Ficoll in 1x MBS.\nPrepare 1x NAM: 110 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM Ca(NO3)2, 1 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM NaHCO3, 2 mM Na3PO4, pH 7.4.\nAnesthetize the female in a 0.03% solution of Ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate salt (MS222) in 0.1x MBS (first dissolve 0.3 g MS222 in 10 ml 95% ethanol, then dilute in 1 L 0.1x MBS) by placing frog in solution for 10 - 15 min or until unresponsive.\n\t\nCheck that anesthesia is complete by turning anesthetized frog onto its back to ensure it does not respond (incompletely anesthetized frogs move limbs or turn body over).",
    "Surgically isolate ovarian fragments by making an abdominal incision through skin and body wall with scalpel blade, isolating ovarian tissue with forceps and scissors. Place ovarian fragments into OR2-. Close the body wall with a 3-0 silk suture on a 24 mm curved needle and close the skin separately with the same sutures. Allow recovery of female in 1 g/L aquarium salt in water.\nUsing fine forceps, tear ovarian tissue into small (10 - 20 oocytes) pieces and transfer to fresh OR2-.\nDefolliculate ovarian fragments in 2.0 mg/ml collagenase A in OR2- by agitating gently on shaker for 1 hr, transferring to fresh collagenase and agitating for one additional hour.\nWash oocytes 10 times in OR2 [containing Ca++/Mg++], discarding smaller oocytes.\nWash oocytes in OCM two times and transfer to fresh OCM. Isolate Stage VI oocytes by size upon visual inspection and discard immature (smaller) oocytes: Stage VI oocytes are larger than immature oocytes with even pigmentation in the animal hemisphere and are approximately 1.2-1.4 mm in diameter.\nMaintain oocytes at 18 - 20 °C in OCM prior to injection. Note: Agarose-coated petri dishes may be used to minimize sticking of oocytes to dish.\n2. Injection of Library Transcripts\nPrepare a directional cDNA library15 using RNA extracted at an appropriate stage of development (for example, neural plate stage 1410). Purchase a cDNA library or construct one using a commercial kit per the overview in the four steps below.\n\t\nIsolate approximately 5 μg mRNA by using a product to enrich for poly(A)+ RNA (See Table of Materials) and following manufacturer's instructions. Note: The transcripts to be used to produce the cDNA library may be restricted to an inducing tissue (such as the neural plate, following microdissection of the desired tissue), or may be from whole embryos at a particular stage.",
    "Produce cDNA with a commercial kit, following manufacturer's directions.\nLigate approximately 20 ng cDNA into a vector included with the commercial kit or another suitable vector. An appropriate plasmid vector includes sequences for mRNA stability such as 5' β-globin and 3 poly(A) sequences (pCS2+, pTnT, pCS105).\nTransform ligation into competent bacterial cells using supplier's recommended protocol for heat shock transformation.\n\t\tNote: Alternatively, a collection of open reading frame (ORFeome) clones is available commercially and may be used to generate transcripts for injection.\nPrepare 10 pools of plasmids of 103 to 104 complexity (104 to 105 total complexity). This represents 10 plates with 1,000 - 10,000 colonies each.\n\t\nPlate library culture onto 10 15-cm LB-ampicillin plates, grow 12 - 18 hr at 37 ˚C, and collect colonies from each by gentle pressure with a glass spreader in 7 ml LB.\nPrepare a glycerol stock from 0.5 ml (add to 0.2 ml sterile glycerol and store at -20 ˚C), and use the remaining 6.5 ml to prepare DNA with a standard commercially available DNA miniprep kit following manufacturer's directions.\nLinearize pooled plasmid DNA (1.0 - 2.0 μg) with appropriate restriction enzyme digest16 at 37 ˚C for 1 - 1.5 hr. Isolate the linearized DNA with phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation and resuspension in water per the specifications of the RNA polymerase kit used. Synthesize sense RNA with a commercial RNA polymerase kit following manufacturer's directions.\nPrepare needles for microinjection (using a needle puller with glass capillary tubing) of approximately 20 μm diameter; measure needle tips on a compound microscope with a calibrated ocular micrometer. Note: Needle puller settings must be empirically determined to produce a needle with a fine tip such that when broken with fine forceps yields the desired tip size.",
    "Prepare (push clay into uniform layer on bottom of dish) clay-lined 35 x 10 mm petri dishes with parallel grooves to hold oocytes in place during microinjection; produce grooves with a mall probe or Pasteur pipette fused at the tip in flame. As an alternative to clay, prepare agarose dishes making indentations with an elastomer mold17. Transfer oocytes with a wide-bore pipette to 3% Ficoll in 1X MBS (approximately 2 ml) in rows in the clay-lined dishes.\nUsing microinjector, fill needle with 1 ng/nl RNA and adjust balance to produce slight positive pressure (to prevent drawing up of oocyte cytoplasm).\nInject oocytes with approximately 20 nl RNA in the equatorial region. Allow 1 hr for injected oocytes to remain in Ficoll-MBS, then transfer gently to 1x MBS. Incubate for 8 - 24 hr at 20 °C prior to animal cap assay.\n3. Animal Cap Assay\nPrepare 3/4x NAM and obtain fine forceps, hair loop, curved coverslip fragments, clay-lined dishes with cup-shaped indentations to hold oocytes. Make curved coverslip fragments by breaking apart glass coverslips into small fragments (approximately 1 - 2 mm x 2 - 4 mm) and passing through flame until edges polish and droop, producing a curved piece.\nFertilize X. laevis eggs18 through in vitro or natural mating and culture to gastrula stages (10 - 11 hr post-fertilization at RT) in 0.1x MBS prior to sorting by stage; collect mid-gastrula (stage 11 - 11.5)10 embryos.\nTransfer embryos to a petri dish approximately half-full with 3/4x NAM. Using two pairs of fine forceps, remove fertilization (vitelline) membrane from gastrulae.\nTransfer oocytes to 3/4x NAM (approximately 2 ml) in clay-lined dishes and immobilize in individual impressions in the clay, producing impressions to accommodate individual embryos as grooves were described above.",
    "Transfer embryos to the clay-lined dishes and cut animal caps off gastrulae using two pairs of fine forceps. Take care to isolate animal cap ectoderm only and not equatorial tissue18.\nPlace an animal cap on the animal hemisphere of each oocyte with the inner surface of the animal cap contacting the oocyte. Hold recombinants together by applying curved glass coverslip fragment and applying downward pressure to the glass, flattening the ectoderm as the coverslip contacts the clay (animal caps can remain open with the inner layer exposed to the surface of the oocyte for 6 - 8 hr or longer).\n\tNote: Alternatively, place the animal cap into a clay indentation with its inner surface facing upward and place an oocyte on the cap; secure the recombinant with small extensions of clay.\nCulture at 20 °C until control embryos reach desired stage for assay.\nSeparate recombinant by removing coverslip/clay and isolating ectoderm with forceps and a hair loop.\nFix ectodermal fragments for 1 hr in MEMFA (3.8% formaldehyde in MEM [0.1 M MOPS pH 7.4, 2 mM EGTA, and 1 mM MgSO4]).\nTransfer fragments (and control embryos) from MEMFA into ethanol and store at -20 ˚C.\n4. Analysis of Response in Ectoderm by In situ Hybridization (ISH)\nPrepare solutions for ISH.\n\t\nPrepare 1x PBS: 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline, NaCl 0.138 M, pH 7.4\nPrepare PBS-Tween (PTw): 1x PBS, 0.1% Tween-20\nPrepare 100x Denhart's solution: 2% BSA, 2% Polyvinylpyrrolidone, 2% Ficoll\nPrepare Hybridization Buffer: 50% Formamide, 5x SSC, 1 mg/ml torula yeast RNA, 1 μg/mL Heparin, 1x Denhart's solution, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mM EDTA, DEPC-H2O\nPrepare Maleic Acid Buffer (MAB): 100 mM maleic acid, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5\nPrepare MAB + block: MAB, 2% blocking reagent (heat to 60 ˚C to dissolve)",
    "Prepare Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) Buffer: 100 mM Tris pH 9.5, 50 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween, dH2O\nPrepare the RNA Probe.\n\t\nUsing a commercial RNA polymerase kit and dig-NTP mix, add to a 1.5 ml tube (50 μl reaction): 25.5 μl DEPC-H2O, 10 μl 5X Transcription Buffer, 2.5 μl 10x dig-NTP mix, 5 μl 100 mM DTT, 2 μl RNAsin, 2 μl linearized DNA template (~1 μg/μl), 3 μl RNA Polymerase and incubate 37 ˚C for 90 min.\nAdd 2 μl RNA Polymerase and incubate 37 ˚C for 60 min.\nCheck 2 μl of reaction on 1% agarose gel.\nAdd 1 μl RQ1 RNase-Free DNase and incubate 37 ˚C for 20 min.\nPrecipitate the probe by adding 50 μl DEPC-H2O, 25 μl 10 M Ammonium Acetate and 313 μl ethanol.

Add 50 μl DEPC-H2O.\nAdd Hybridization Buffer to a final concentration of ~0.5 μg/μl.\nPrepare Tissue for Hybridization. Unless otherwise noted, fill vials to the top with each solution change described (approximately 4 ml).\n\t\nRemove ethanol from vials and transfer embryos into 75% ethanol/PTw, then 50% ethanol/PTw for 10 min each, horizontally on rocker.\nWash three times in PTw for 5 min each on rocker.\nTransfer to 10 μg/μl Proteinase K treatment in PTw; rock tubes vertically 15 min.\nRinse twice 10 min each in 0.1 M Triethanolamine pH 7.8 - rock tubes vertically.\nAdd 12.5 μl acetic anhydride to tubes and rock vertically 5 min. Repeat with additional 12.5 μl acetic anhydride for 5 min.\nWash in PTw 5 min vertically on rocker.",
    "Refix in 4% paraformaldehyde 20 min on rocker. Heat Hybridization Buffer to 60 ˚C.\nWash three times in PTw for 5 min each on rocker.\nRemove all but ~1 ml of PTw from each tube and add 250 μl Hyb Buffer; gently swirl tubes to mix.
