    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIncorporate Drosophila S2 cell chromatin in ChIP samples of human prostate cancer PC-3 cells\nTiming: about 2 days\nThe information of pan-chromatin changes would be lost in the PCR-based amplification of DNA library. To retrieve the lost information, it is necessary to use the constant amount of Drosophila chromatin to precipitate alongside with the PC-3 cell chromatin.\n(Prepare the block solution) Pre-block and binding of antibody to magnetic beads.\nAdd 100 μL Dynal magnetic beads to microfuge tube. Add 1 mL block solution. Set up 1 tube per IP.\nCollect the beads using magnetic stand. Remove supernatant.\nWash beads in 1.5 mL block solution two more times.\nResuspend beads in 250 μL block solution and add 10 μg of antibody.\nIncubate for 16 h on a rotating platform at 4°C.\nNext day, wash beads as described above (3 times in 1 mL block solution).\nResuspend in 100 μL block solution.\nCombine Drosophila S2 cell and human PC-3 cell chromatin from Preparation 2.\nFor each spike-in H3K27-ac ChIP experiment (in either DMSO or SAHA treated cells), a 20:1 ratio of PC-3 versus Drosophila S2 cell chromatin was used (according to the DNA quantification results). Typically, we got ∼300 μg DNA in sonicated chromatin from 5×107 PC3 cells (in a volume of ∼1.5 mL). Therefore, the S2 cell chromatin containing 15 μg Drosophila DNA would be added.\nNote: Once Drosophila S2 and human cells were combined, the sample was treated as a single ChIP-seq sample throughout the experiment until completion of DNA sequencing.\nAdd 100 μL antibody/magnetic bead mix to 1.5 mL chromatin mixture produced above.\nGently mix for 16 h on rotator or rocker at 4°C.\n(Prepare Wash Buffer, TE Buffer and Elution Buffer, set thermoshaker to 65°C) Wash, elution, and cross-link reversal after ChIP.",
    "Pre-chill one 1.5-mL microfuge tube for each ChIP.\nTransfer half the volume of the ChIP material (steps 2b and 2c) to a pre-chilled tube.\nLet tubes sit in magnetic stand to collect the beads. Remove supernatant and add remaining IP. Let tubes sit again in magnetic stand to collect the beads.\nAdd 1 mL Wash Buffer to each tube. Remove tubes from magnetic stand and shake or agitate tube gently to resuspend beads. Replace tubes in magnetic stand to collect beads. Remove supernatant. Wash 7 more times.\nNote: Exact number of washes depends on quality of antibody and may need to be optimized for each antibody. For most antibody we used, washing 6 times or more is applicable.\nWash once with 1 mL TE buffer that contains 50 mM NaCl.\nSpin at 1,000 × g for 3 min at 4°C and remove any residual TE buffer.\nAdd 210 μL of elution buffer.\nElute at 65°C for 15 min. Resuspend beads every 2 min with brief vortex.\nSpin down beads at 11,000 × g for 1 min at 21°C.\nRemove 200 μL of supernatant and transfer to new tube. Reverse crosslink of this IP DNA by incubating at 65°C for 16 h.\nCritical: Steps 3a through 3e should be carried out in a 4°C cold room.\n(set thermoshaker to 55°C) Digestion of cellular protein/RNA and extraction of ChIP-DNA.\nAdd 200 μL of TE buffer to each tube of IP to dilute SDS in elution buffer.\nAdd 8 μL of 10 mg/mL RNaseA (0.2 μg/mL final concentration).\nMix and incubate at 37°C for 2 h.\nAdd 4 μL of 20 mg/mL proteinase K (0.2 μg/mL final concentration).\nMix and incubate at 55°C for 2 h.",
    "Add 400 μL phenol: chloroform: isoamyl alcohol (P:C: IA) and transfer the mixture to a new 2-mL tube. Then centrifuge the sample at 12,000 × g for 10 min to separate phases.\nTransfer 400 μL aqueous layer to new centrifuge tube containing 16 μL of 5M NaCl (200 mM final concentration) and 1.5 μL of 20 μg/μL glycogen (30 μg total).\nAdd 800 μL EtOH. Incubate for 30 min at −80°C.\nSpin at 11,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to pellet DNA. Wash pellets with 500 μL of 80% EtOH.\nDry pellets and resuspend each in 70 μL of 10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0.\nSave 15 μL of ChIP product for future checkpoints or verification.\nMeasure DNA concentration of ChIP products with Qubit dsDNA quantification system. (Here is a Safe Stopping Point, DNA samples can be stored at −80°C for one month.)\nAnalyzing PC-3 cell ChIP-DNA with spike-in Drosophila DNA\nTiming: 7–14 days\nThe ChIP-sequencing generally takes 4–55 h, but the exact time can vary greatly depending on the workload of the sequencing core, the model of the sequencers (NextSeq, NovaSeq) used, the flow cells used, and the availability of the computational resources. The analysis time also varies significantly commensurate to personal experiences and different type of tertiary analyses (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). A walkthrough example to analyze spike-in ChIP-seq data are provided in our online documentation (https://spiker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html[href=https://spiker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/829-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Workflow of spike-in ChIP-DNA sequencing and analysis",
    "Sequencing. We use The NEB Next Ultra II DNA Library Preparation Kit to convert our ChIP DNA (containing spike-in Drosophila DNA) into libraries for next-generation sequencing on the Illumina platform. To be general, the dsDNA from step 4 is end repaired, 5′ phosphorylated and added with a dA tail at the 3′ ends. Then the processed DNA is ligated with NEBNext Adaptors (adaptor is 1:10 diluted) and U excision is performed. We do clean up of the products without size selection, following the kit instruction. We amplify these DNA to a library yield of ∼1000 ng using PCR (We use unique dual index E6440S that has both forward and reverse primers, PCR cycles is 15). Libraries were sequenced at 30 million fragment reads per sample following Illumina’s standard protocol using the Illumina cBot and HiSeq 3000/4000 PE Cluster Kit. Base-calling is performed using Illumina’s RTA version 2.7.7. Raw reads in FASTQ format are usually delivered from the sequencing core. If pre-aligned BAM files are delivered, we convert them back into FASTQ files using Samtools (e.g., samtools fastq -1 read_1.fq -2 read_2.fq -0 /dev/null -s /dev/null -n input.bam).\nPreprocessing and mapping. After QC, reads are mapped to the composite reference genome comprised of human and Drosophila chromosomes (human/hg38 + Drosophila/dm6).\nDownload the human reference genome sequences (the current version is GRCh38 or hg38) and Drosophila reference genome sequences (the current version is “BDGP Release 6 + ISO1 MT” or dm6) reference genome sequences and saved as “hg38.fa.gz” and “dm6.fa.gz”, respectively.\nUncompress “hg38.fa.gz” and “dm6.fa.gz”.",
    "Because both human and Drosophila genomes have the chromosome X (named “chrX”) and chromosome Y (named “chrY”), we need to modify the Drosophila chromosome IDs to make them different from humans. In this case, we add “dm6_” to each chromosome ID of the Drosophila. For example, we change Drosophila’s “chrX” into “dm6_chrX”, “chr2L” into “dm6_chr2L”, and so forth. Although changing the human chromosome IDs is technically equivalent at this step (for example, changing human “chr1” into “hg38_chr1”), doing this brings inconvenience even problems present in downstream analyses.\nConcatenate the human reference genome sequences (hg38) and Drosophila reference genome sequences (dm6) into a single FASTA file – the composite reference genome named “hg38_dm6.fa”.\nIndex the “hg38_dm6.fa” using the “bowtie2-build” command: bowtie2-build hg38_dm6.fa hg38_dm6\nMap reads to the composite reference genome using Bowtie2. Using Samtools, convert the output alignments into BAM format, sort the BAM files by position, and then index them. Using other short reads aligners such as BWA is fine, as long as the composite reference genome is indexed accordingly.\nRepeat this step for all biological replicates of ChIP and control samples.\nA step-by-step implementation is given below. Assuming ‘wget’, ‘gunzip’, ‘sed’, ‘bowtie2’, ‘bowtie2-build’ and ‘samtools’ commands are already available in a Linux/Unix environment.\nQuantify Drosophila chromatin. The amount of Drosophila chromatin in the sequencing library can be measured by the number of reads that are aligned to the Drosophila genome. Reads in each BAM file can be classified into four categories including:\n“Human reads”: reads can only map to the human reference genome. These reads are used for peak calling.\n“Drosophila reads”: reads can only map to the Drosophila genome. These reads are used to calculate the scaling factors.\n“Both”: reads can be mapped to both human and the Drosophila genomes. These reads are tossed out.",
    "“Neither (or unmapped)”: reads cannot reliably map to the composite reference genome. Reads with mapping quality (MAPQ) < 30 are also included in this category.\n# Step (a): Download reference genome sequences.\n$ wget http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/hg38.fa.gz[href=http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/hg38.fa.gz]\n$ wget http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/dm6/bigZips/dm6.fa.gz[href=http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/dm6/bigZips/dm6.fa.gz]\n# Step (b): Uncompress the reference genome files.\n$ gunzip hg38.fa.gz\n$ gunzip dm6.fa.gz\n# Step (c): Change Drosophila chromosome IDs.\n$ sed 's/chr/dm6_chr/g' dm6.fa > dm6_renameID.fa\n# Step (d): Concatenate the human and Drosophila genome files.\n$ cat hg38.fa dm6_renameID.fa > hg38_dm6.fa\n# Step (e): Run \"bowtie2-build\" command to build index files.\n# \"hg38_dm6\" is the prefix of index files, which is needed in the next step.\n$ bowtie2-build hg38_dm6.fa hg38_dm6\n# Step (f): Use \"bowtie2\" to map reads to the composite reference genome (i.e., hg38_dm6.fa); save the alignments in BAM format; sort and index the BAM file using samtools.\n# For paired-end reads\n$ bowtie2 --threads 4 -x GRCh38_dm6 -1 read_1.fastq.gz -2 read_2. fastq.gz | samtools view -Sbh - > output.bam\n# For single-end reads\n$ bowtie2 --threads 4 -x GRCh38_dm6 -U read.fastq.gz | samtools view -Sbh - > output.bam\n# sort the BAM file using samtools\n$ samtools sort -@ 4 output.bam > output.sorted.bam\n# index the BAM file using samtools\n$ samtools index -@ 4 output.sorted.bam\n# Step (g) : Repeat steps (a-f) for other samples.\nRun “split_bam.py” in the SPIKER package (https://spiker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html[href=https://spiker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html]) to classify reads and split the “composite” BAM files into Human and Drosophila BAM files.",
    "Calculate scaling factors. For both peak calling (i.e., comparing ChIP to control samples) and quantitative analysis (i.e., comparing different ChIP samples), the number of “Drosophila reads” calculated from different samples need to normalize to the same level. For example, if we want to normalize the number of “Drosophila reads” to 1 million, the scaling factor for a particular sample with 800,000 Drosophila reads is 1000000/800000 = 1.25.\nPeak calling. The peak calling procedure is described in https://spiker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html[href=https://spiker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html]. Depending on the histone marker, ENCODE narrowPeak or gappedPeak are generated. bedGraph and bigwig files are also generated for visualization on UCSC genome browser.
