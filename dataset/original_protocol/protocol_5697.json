    "Incorporation of BrdU:C and metaphase chromosome spread preparationCells are seeded into a 6 or 10 cm dish at least two days before harvesting, to be about 70% confluent at the time of harvesting. In a 10 cm dish, seed ~1 million cells.Cells are then labeled for 16-20 h by incubating with 5’-Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and 5’-Bromodeoxycytidine (BrdC). Thaw a 1,000x aliquot of BrdU and BrdC and mix 3:1 to obtain 7.5 mM BrdU + 2.5 mM BrdC. Add to the cells medium at a 1:1,000 dilution and incubate the cells overnight. Note: Adjust the time of BrdU:C labeling according to whether your cells grow slower/faster to avoid double labeling or incompletely labeled cells. You are aiming for cells to incorporate BrdU and BrdC throughout S-phase and to prevent them to exit from mitosis after replication. Typically, HeLa cells are incubated with BrdU:C for 14-16 h before adding colcemid; to validate the time of BrdU:C incubation one can synchronize cells with thymidine at G1/S, release and monitor exit from mitosis by flow cytometry. Cells that exit mitosis 15 h post-thymidine release should be treated with BrdU:C for 16-17 h before addition of colcemid to ensure only cells that started labeling before S-phase are trapped by the colcemid block.Add colcemid to a final concentration of 0.1 µg/ml (1:100 dilution of 10 µg/ml stock) to accumulate mitotic cells for about 2 h before harvesting. Note: Avoid leaving cells into colcemid for over 3 h, because long exposure to colcemid will lead to very compacted chromosome morphology.Harvest floating cells by saving the supernatant in a 15 ml Falcon tube, wash the dish once with PBS and collect the PBS wash as well into the same tube.",
    "Trypsinize for 5 min, block with medium containing fetal bovine serum, and collect the rest of the cells in the same tube.Pellet cells for 5 min at 175 x g. Remove supernatant and resuspend cells in 10 ml of pre-warmed 75 mM KCl solution. Gently pipette up and down to resuspend the pellet. Incubate the cells in the KCl hypotonic solution at 37 °C for 30 min (slowly invert the tube every 10 min to keep the cells suspended). Before pelleting the cells, adding 200 µl of fixative solution and mixing by slowly inverting the tubes twice helps the metaphases to remain intact during centrifugation, because cells are extremely fragile after the hypotonic treatment. Pellet the cells for 5 min at 175 x g. Aspirate most supernatant, leaving about 200 µl of KCl to resuspend cells by tapping the tube or slowly pipetting up and down with a P1000. Fix the resuspended pellet by adding 10 ml of freshly made ice-cold MeOH-acetic acid (3:1) fixative solution dropwise (prepare it 30 min before use, keep at -20 °C) while continuously vortexing the tube on a Vortex mixer at the lowest speed setting (#1). Note: It is important to resuspend the pellet before addition of the fixative, and to add the fixative one drop at a time while continuously vortexing the cells at low speed for at least the first 2 ml. The remaining 8 ml can be added all at once. Mix by inverting the tube a few times. Cells can now be kept at 4 °C for several months, stored away from light.Once you are ready to drop the cells, spin the tube down at 380 x g for 5 min. Aspirate the fixative leaving about 0.5-2 ml depending on how many cells are in each tube.",
    "Thoroughly resuspend cells in the remaining fixative.If you are dropping onto Superfrost Plus slides, go directly to Step A13. If using regular slides, wash in soapy water and rinse 3 times with Milli-Q water before use. Keep slides in Milli-Q water in the fridge for an hour and dry well right before use. Humidify the slide you are about to ‘drop’ on by hovering it over a hot wet towel placed on a heating block, until it steams up. You can also achieve this by ‘breathing’ onto the slide. Note: Creating conditions of humidity, for instance by having wet paper towels onto an adjacent 90 °C block that continues to release vapor, and humidifying the air immediately adjacent to where slides are dropped, or using a hybridization hood with set humidity and temperature, helps with the quality of the spreads. Using a glass Pasteur pipette, pipette up and down and aspirate the cell suspension. Drop several drops of cell suspension onto different places on the slide from about 20 cm away. You should aim to cover all parts of the slide with each drop.Note on safety: Gloves and lab coat should be used to protect from possible splashes. The entire metaphase spread procedure can be performed in a laboratory chemical fume hood for additional protection.Immediately after dropping, rest the slide for about 2-3 min onto a 42 °C block with a wet paper towel covering the block, cells side up. Note: Factors that influence the spreading are: humidity, temperature, distance of dropping cells onto the slide and drying time. Air-dry slides overnight at room temperature away from light. You can keep any cells left into the falcon tube stored in fresh fixative at 4 °C for up to one year.",
    "Enzymatic digestion of BrdU:C labeled, newly synthesized strandDropped slides are inserted in a Coplin jar and rehydrated in PBS (pH 7.0-7.5) for 5 min (about 35 ml of solution is needed for each jar).Treat slides with 0.5 mg/ml RNase A (in PBS, DNase free) for 10 min in a 37 °C water bath.Stain slides with 1 µg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted into 2x SSC for 15 min at room temperature with slight agitation.Place slides in a shallow plastic tray and add just enough 2x SSC buffer to cover the slides. Expose the slides to 365 nm UV light at room temperature for 1,800 sec (30 min; equivalent to 5,400 J/m2) in a Stratalinker 1800.Digest the BrdU:C labeled UV nicked DNA strand with 80 µl of 10 U/µl Exonuclease III (Promega) into buffer supplied by the manufacturer diluted to 1x (50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, pH 8.0). Add the 80 µl solution onto a 24 x 60 coverslip that will make contact with the entire surface of the cells on the slide. Let it adhere to the slide, then place the slide cells side up for 10 min, away from light. Avoid air bubbles.Remove the coverslips and repeat the Exonuclease III digestion step with fresh solution for another 10 min.Wash slides in PBS for 5 min and dehydrate successively in 70%, 90%, 100% ethanol series for 2 min each. Air dry slides and store at room temperature in the dark (can be left overnight).Fluorescent in situ hybridizationPlace 80 µl of hybridization mix onto coverslips and pick up the coverslip with the slide, then put the slide into the hybridization chamber (see Figures 1G-1I for instructions on how to make a hybridization chamber and for a visual illustration of these steps). Avoid air bubbles.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180329/20180329225650_6887.jpgFigure 1.",
    "Representative images of the Cen-CO-FISH procedure at different stages of the protocol. A. Cells are harvested, hypotonically swollen and fixed overnight. Samples can be stored at 4 °C at this stage. Cells are then dropped onto glass slides to let the metaphases spread. Slides can be stored in the dark at room temperature (RT) before proceeding to Step B. B. Rehydrate the slides into PBS in a Coplin jar for 5 min. C. Remove PBS and add RNase A solution into the jar, incubate in a 37 °C water bath for 10 min. Remove RNase solution and incubate with Hoechst in 2x SSC for 15 min at RT. D. Place slides into plastic try and cover with just enough 2x SSC. E. Place tray into Stratalinker oven with 365 nm UV bulbs and expose for 30 min (1,800 sec). F. Prepare 80 μl of Exonuclease III solution for each slide and add the solution to a 24 x 60 coverslip that will make contact with the entire surface of the slide. G. Immediately after UV exposure, pick up the coverslip with Exonuclease III solution as shown. Invert the slide, adjust the coverslip to make sure it is central, the liquid is well distributed and there are no air bubbles. Incubate cells side up for 10 min at RT and then repeat Steps F-G one more time for an additional Exonuclease incubation. Wash in PBS and dehydrate in ethanol series. Store slides at RT in the dark (overnight). H. Prepare one of the probes (1:1,000-1:5,000) into hybridization solution, heat for 10 min at 60 °C before adding 80 μl onto the coverslips. Proceed as in Steps F-G shown. I. Place slides into a Hybridization chamber and incubate for 2 h at RT.",
    "To make a chamber, take a box, fill it with paper towels and wet throughout until all towels are humid. Do not put the slides directly on top of the wet paper. Use pipettes or other forms of support to raise the coverslips over the wet paper. Place slides cells side up and close the box away from light. Upon opening the box after 2 h, you should see a small amount of condensation on the lid. Wash with Hybridization buffer #1 and repeat Step H with the second, reverse complement probe (you can invert the order of the hybridization between forward and reverse complement probes, it should yield identical results). Wash in Hybridization buffer #1 and #2, including the DAPI step, dehydrate and air dry for at least one hour. Mount and seal before imaging.Hybridize with the Forward PNA probe at a 1:1,000 dilution (heated at 60 °C for 10 min right before use) in the dark for 2 h in the hybridization chamber.Rinse in Wash #1 for 30 sec. Leave slides draining vertically for 10 sec.Hybridize with the Reverse Complement PNA probe at a 1:1,000 dilution (heated at 60 °C for 10 min right before use) in the dark for 2 h. Note: Inverting the order of the probes will not affect the hybridization or quality of the signal.Wash slides in Wash #1 for 15 min 2 times on an orbital shaker.Wash slides in Wash #2 for 5 min 3 times. To the second wash, add 1:500 DAPI from 0.5 mg/ml stock.Dehydrate in 70%, 90%, 100% ethanol series for 3 min each.Air dry slides for about 1 h.Mount slides using Prolong Gold embedding medium (avoid bubbles) and seal using nail varnish. Slides are ready for imaging.",
    "Slides can be stored up to 1 week at 4 °C or at -20 °C for longer storage."
