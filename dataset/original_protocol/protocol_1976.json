The total yield of AzCas12a is about 10 mg/L after purification. The protein can be used for further applications.\nE. coli transformation and culture.\nDay 1. Transform E. coli BL21(DE3) cells with pET22B-Cas12a-mutant and pUltra-CNF plasmids and cultivate the cells on a LB plate containing antibiotics (50 μg/mL spectinomycin and 100 μg/mL ampicillin) for 12–16 h.

    "Day 3. Take 10 mL of overnight culture and dilute it with 1 L of 2YT expression medium containing antibiotics (50 μg/mL spectinomycin and 100 μg/mL ampicillin), and incubate at 37°C and 220 rpm until OD600 reaches 0.3.\nAdd unnatural amino acid AeF to the culture at a final concentration of 1 mM. Grow the culture at 37°C until OD600 reaches 0.6–0.8, then cool at 4°C for 15 min, and add isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.2 mM.\nMaintain the culture at 18°C and 220 rpm in a shaker incubator for 16 h to express Cas12a protein.\nCas12a protein purification.\nDay 4. Harvest cells by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.\nCritical: All the buffer for purification should be filtered with 0.22 μM filter before use. Otherwise, the protein may be degraded seriously during purification.\nDiscard supernatant, and resuspend cells in 100 mL of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 1 M KCl, 10 mM imidazole) containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to prevent protein degradation and then sonicate the suspension (30% power 5 s on and 5 s off) on ice for 20 min.\nCentrifuge the lysate at 18,000 × g for 20–30 min at 4°C to pellet the cellular debris.\nBalance a Ni-NTA resin gravity column with lysis buffer, load the supernatant on the column, and allow it to flow under the influence of gravity. Repeat this loading step two additional times.\nWash the resin with 5–10 column volumes of wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 1 M KCl, 20 mM imidazole).\nElute the protein from the column with 10–20 mL of elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 1 M KCl, 250 mM imidazole).",
