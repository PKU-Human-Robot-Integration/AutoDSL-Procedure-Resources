    "For animal experiments, all methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Medical College of Wisconsin.\n1. Prepare reagents\nPrepare lysis buffer to concentrations of 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT, 100 µg/mL cycloheximide, protease inhibitors, and recombinant RNase inhibitors to concentrations as described below.\n\t\nAdd following reagents to 500 mL of RNase-free deionized water: 1.19 g of HEPES, 5.59 g of KCl, 0.24 g of MgCl2, 35 mg of DTT, 0.5 mL of cycloheximide, and NaOH as needed until pH 7.4, EDTA-free protease inhibitors (one mini tablet per 10 mL) and RNase inhibitor (10 µL/mL).\nStore in a 4 °C fridge for up to 1 month.\nPrepare a high-salt polysome wash buffer to concentrations of 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 350 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1% vol/vol CA-630, 0.5 mM DTT, and 100 µg/mL cycloheximide.\n\t\nAdd following reagents to 500 mL of RNase-free deionized water: 1.19 g of HEPES, 13.05 g of KCl, 0.24 g of MgCl2, 5 mL of nonionic, non-denaturing detergent, 5 of 7.7 mg tubes of DTT, and 0.5 mL of cycloheximide, and NaOH as needed until pH 7.4.\nStore in 4 °C fridge for up to 1 month.\nBind anti-GFP antibody to Protein G magnetic beads prior to starting experiment.\n\t\nAdd 10 µg of anti-GFP antibody diluted in 200 µL of PBS to Protein G beads.\nIncubate with end over end rotation for 10 minutes at room temperature.\nPlace the beads on a magnetic rack and remove the supernatant.\nSuspend the beads in 200 µL of PBS and store in 4 °C fridge for up to 1 week.\nPrepare ice-cold PBS with 100 µg/mL cycloheximide.",
    "Add 1 volume of cycloheximide solution (100 mg/mL) to 999 volumes of ice-cold PBS.\n2. Isolate and lyse desired tissues\nEuthanize mice by IP injection of ketamine (500 mg/kg/body weight) and xylazine (10 mg/kg/body weight) and isolate desired tissues (i.e., heart, lung). Immediately proceed to next step.\nPlace desired tissues into 500 µL of ice-cold PBS with 100 µg/mL cycloheximide.\nMince tissue into a cell suspension with a motor-driven homogenizer or a small-clearance glass homogenizer. If using a motor-driven homogenizer, limit homogenization to less than 1 minute at low frequency (<15,000 Hz) to avoid RNA denaturation.\nSuspend cell pellet in 200 µL of lysis buffer by pipetting and redrawing up buffer several times. Further homogenize cell suspension with 10 strokes in a small-clearance glass homogenizer or for 15 seconds at low frequency (<15,000 Hz) in a motor driven homogenizer.\nCentrifuge homogenates for 10 min at 2,000 x g at 4 °C to pellet nuclei and large cell debris, and keep the supernatant.\nAdd nonionic, non-denaturing detergent to 1% vol/vol and DHPC to 30 mM to the supernatant. Incubate on ice for 5 min.\nCentrifuge lysate for 10 min at 16,000 x g to pellet insoluble material. Transfer and keep 15% of clear lysate as input for future steps.\n3. Isolate ribosome/mRNA complexes\nAdd 50 µL of antibody-bound beads to cell-lysate supernatant and incubate mixture at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation for 30 min. This is where the anti-GFP antibodies will bind the GFP-tagged ribosomes, allowing us to further isolate the RNA from these ribosomes.\nCollect beads on a magnetic rack and wash 5 times with high-salt polysome wash buffer.",
    "Draw up and discard liquid once beads have collected on the side of the tube. Then pipette and redraw up 200 µL of high-salt polysome wash buffer several times. Repeat this step 5 times and discard all buffer following final repetition. Immediately proceed to next step.\n4. Isolate mRNA\nPlace beads in RLT buffer. The following steps are taken directly from the RNeasy mini kit protocol and were not expanded on in any way.\n\tCAUTION: RLT buffer contains guanidine salts; do NOT mix with bleach.\nCentrifuge lysate for 3 min at full speed 13,000 rpm or 16,000 g at 4 °C. Carefully remove supernatant of 350 µL by pipetting and transfer it to a new microfuge tube. Use only this supernatant (lysate) in subsequent steps.\nAdd an equal volume of 70% ethanol into the microfuge tube.\nTransfer up to 700 µL of the sample, including any precipitate that may have formed, to a spin column placed in a 2 mL collection tube. Close the lid gently and centrifuge for 15 s at ≥8,000 x g to wash the spin column membrane. Discard the flow-through.\nAdd 350 µL of buffer RW1 to the spin column. Close the lid gently and centrifuge for 15 s at ≥8,000 x g to wash the spin column membrane. Discard the flow-through and reuse the collection tube in next step.\n\tCAUTION: Buffer RW1 contains guanidine salts; do NOT mix with bleach.\nAdd 350 µL of buffer RW1 to the spin column. Close the lid gently and centrifuge for 15 s at ≥8,000 x g. Discard the flow-through.\nAdd 500 µL of buffer RPE to the spin column. Close the lid gently and centrifuge for 15 s at ≥8,000 x g to wash the spin column membrane. Discard the flow-through.",
    "Add 500 µL of buffer RPE to the spin column. Close the lid gently and centrifuge for 2 min at ≥8,000 x g to wash the spin column membrane. Then carefully remove the spin column from the collection tube, ensuring that the column does not contact the flow-through.\nPlace the spin column in a new 2 mL collection tube and discard the old tube with the flow-through. Close the lid gently and centrifuge at full speed for 1 min to remove residual buffer.\nPlace the spin column in a new 1.5 mL collection tube. Add 30-50 µL of RNase-free water directly to the spin column membrane. Close the lid gently and centrifuge for 1 min at ≥8,000 x g to elute the RNA.\nIf expected RNA yield is >30 µg, repeat step 4.10 with another 30-50 µL of RNase-free water, or using elute from Step 4.10 (if high [RNA] is required). Reuse collection tube from Step 4.10.\nUse purified RNA for downstream analysis including RNA-sequencing or real time quantitative PCR or store RNA dissolved in RNase-free H2O at -80 °C for up to 1 year.\nSubscription Required.
