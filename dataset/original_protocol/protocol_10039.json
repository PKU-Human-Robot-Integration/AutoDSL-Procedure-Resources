    "1. Preparation of keratinocyte culture medium\nNOTE: Perform all procedures under aseptic conditions.\nAdd 5 mL of penicillin-streptomycin and 10 mL of additive supplement K-1 to 500 mL of K110 Type-II medium (K110) using a pipette.\n2. Preparation of the fibril form of type I collagen\nNOTE: Perform procedures until step 2.6 under aseptic conditions.\nKeep 10x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS (-)), deionized water, collagen, a 96-well culture plate, and an empty 2-mL tube on ice.\n\tNOTE: Do not use the same plate to prepare the fibril and non-fibrous forms.\nAdd 1.12 mL of deionized water to an empty 2 mL tube using a pipette. Add 200 µL of 10x PBS (-) to the deionized water in the 2 mL tube using a pipette. Gently shake the tube several times.\nAdd 0.66 mL of collagen to the 2 mL tube using a pipette. Gently and quickly shake the tube several times.\n\tNOTE: Avoid bubble formation in the solution as much as possible. Prepare collagen solution immediately prior to use.\nPour 100 µL of the collagen solution from step 2.3 into each well of the 96-well culture plate. Gently shake the culture plate in a left to right motion.\n\tNOTE: Cover the entire surface of the wells with the collagen solution. If the solution does not cover the entire surface, spread the solution using a pipette tip. Avoid bubble formation in the solution as much as possible.\nPlace the culture plate in a CO2 incubator and incubate at 37 °C for 1 h. Check the gelation of collagen and move the culture plate to a clean bench.\n\tNOTE: Confirm gelation by tilting the culture plate.",
    "Gently pour 150 µL of K110 on the gels using a pipette along the wall of the well, place the culture plate in a CO2 incubator and incubate at 37 °C for 1 h. Move the culture plate to a clean bench. Prior to cell culture, gently discard the K110 using a pipette.\n\tNOTE: To protect the gels, the tip of the pipette should touch the wall of the well.\n3. Preparation of the non-fibrous form of type I collagen\nNOTE: Perform all procedures under aseptic conditions.\nAdd 4 µL of collagen to 1.2 mL of 1 mM hydrochloric acid (HCl) in a 1.5 mL tube and gently mix using a pipette.\n\tNOTE: Prepare collagen immediately prior to use. Keep collagen and HCl chilled until the time of use.\nPour 100 µL of collagen into each well of a 96-well culture plate using a pipette. Gently shake the culture plate in a left to right motion and incubate at room temperature for 1 h.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that the entire surface of the wells is covered with solution.\nAfter the incubation, discard the collagen solution and wash the wells with PBS (-) twice using a pipette.\nPour 150 µL of 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS (-) (1% BSA) to a well of the 96-well culture plate and incubate at room temperature for 1 h. Prior to cell culture, discard the 1% BSA.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that the entire surface of the wells is covered with solution.\n4. Culture of FEPE1L-8 cells\nNOTE: Perform all procedures under aseptic conditions.\nMaintain FEPE1L-8 cells in K110 in a 100 mm culture dish in a CO2 incubator and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2, to semi-confluency.\nPrepare K110, trypsin, and trypsin inhibitor in a water bath at 37 °C.",
    "Carefully remove the medium from the culture dish, add 3 mL of 0.05% trypsin using a pipette, place the dish in a CO2 incubator and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min. After incubation, check cell detachment from the surface of the culture dish using phase-contrast microscopy at 10x magnification.\n\tNOTE: The morphology of the detached cells becomes round. If the cells spread, incubate for an additional period of 5 min.\nAdd 3 mL of trypsin inhibitor and collect the detached cells in a 15 mL centrifuge tube using a pipette. Centrifuge the cells in a 15 mL centrifuge tube at 200 x g for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and re-suspend the pellet in 10 mL of K110 using a pipette. Count the cells using phase-contrast microscopy at 10x magnification and prepare cell concentration at 5.0 x 104 cells/mL by appropriate dilution with K110.\nGently seed 0.1 mL of K110 with cells in each well of the culture plate using a pipette along the wall of the well. Place the culture plate in a CO2 incubator and incubate at 37 °C for the indicated time (2 h, 1 day, 3 days).\n\tNOTE: To protect the gels, the tip of the pipette should touch the wall of the well.\n5. Estimation of the number of viable cells\nIncubate K110 in a water bath at 37 °C. Mix 130 µL of tetrazolium salt, 2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H tetrazolium, monosodium salt (WST-8), and 1.3 mL of K110 in a 2-mL tube using a pipette.\nMove the culture plate to a clean bench and gently discard the K110 using a pipette. Gently wash away non-adherent cells with K110 by using a pipette",
    "Add 110 µL of K110 mixed with WST-8 in each well using a pipette, place the culture plate in a CO2 incubator and incubate at 37 °C for 2 h.\nMove the culture plate to a clean bench, collect 100 µL of the conditioned medium from each well, and move it into a well of another 96-well culture plate. Measure absorbance at a wavelength of 450 nm (OD450) using a microplate reader and estimate the number of viable cells."
