    "Centrifuge the CFU at maximum speed for 10 min and discard the flowthrough. Wash each ultracentrifuge tube with an additional 450 µL of 1x TLE and transfer to its CFU for another wash.\n\t\tNOTE: Washing the CFU this way limits DNA loss while reducing salt concentration.\nCentrifuge the CFU at maximum speed for 10 min and discard the flowthrough.\nAdd 80 µL of 1x TLE to the column and turn the column around into a new collection tube before centrifuging for 2 min at maximum speed to obtain a final volume of ~100 µL.\nAdd 1 µL of RnaseA (1 mg/mL; 10-fold dilution of 10 mg/mL stock) to each sample and incubate at 37 °C on a heat block, in a water bath, or a thermomixer for at least 30 min.\nAfter the Rnase treatment, remove the samples from 37 °C and store at 4 °C until the quality control step.\nChecking chromatin quality, enzyme digestion, and sample ligation\n\t\nCool the CI and DC samples to room temperature after reversing the crosslinks in step 2.4.5.

Hi-C sequencing library preparation\nRemoval of biotin from unligated ends\n\t\nPrepare biotin removal reactions as shown in Table 5.\n\t\tNOTE: Typically, 10 µg of DNA is sufficient, but up to 30 µg can be used.\nDistribute 2 x 65 µL aliquots from each 130 µL reaction into two PCR tubes.\nTransfer to a thermocycler or PCR machine and incubate as described in Table 5.\n\t\tNOTE: Samples can be stored here at 4 °C (days to weeks), -20 °C (long term), or immediately carried over to sonication.\nSonication",
    "Pool the sample duplicates from the biotin removal step (130 µL total sample volume) into a 130 µL sonicator tube for sonication.\nSonicate the samples using the parameters given in Table 6 to achieve a tight narrow distribution below 500 bp.\n\t\tNOTE: Different sonicator types can be used, but for a narrow fragment distribution (100-500 bp), sonicator settings may require optimization.\nSize selection with magnetic beads\n\t\nPipet the sonicated DNA from the sonicator tube(s) into a 1.7 mL low binding tube.\nBring each sample to a total volume of 500 µL with 1x TLE. Try to get the volume as close as possible to 500 µL, since the ratio of sample to magnetic beads mixture is essential for size selection.\nAdd 400 µL of magnetic beads mixture to each tube to attain a ratio of magnetic beads mixture to the sample volume of 0.8.\n\t\tNOTE: Under these conditions, beads capture DNA fragments >300 bp, which will be the Upper Fraction. The supernatant will contain fragments <300 bp, which will be the Lower Fraction.\nMix the tubes by vortexing and incubate for 10 min at room temperature on a rotator. For this and other size selection ratios, make sure that the full volume of the sample mixes well. Look for the \"erratic mode\" that some rotors have, which works well for smaller volumes.\nIncubate for 5 min at room temperature on a magnetic particle separator (MPS).\nWhile incubating, add 500 µL of the magnetic beads mixture to a fresh 1.7 µL low binding tube for each sample.\n\t\tNOTE: These tubes will be used for the next size selection of the lower fraction by generating a magnetic beads mixture to sample ratio of 1.1:1.\nLeave the tubes on the MPS for 5 min.",
    "Remove the supernatant from the beads and resuspend with 150 µL of the magnetic beads mixture.\n\t\tNOTE: This step avoids saturation of the beads with DNA by increasing the number of beads without increasing the volume.\nTransfer the supernatant from step 3.3.5 to the labeled tube prepared to select the Lower Fraction (step 3.3.8).\n\t\tNOTE: 150 µL of magnetic beads mixture + 400 µL of 0.8x magnetic beads mixture (550 µL total) divided by 500 µL of initial sample = 1.1x magnetic beads mixture to sample ratio.\nMix the Lower Fraction tubes by vortexing and incubate for 10 min at room temperature on a rotator.\n\t\tNOTE: The beads will bind DNA fragments >100 bp, resulting in a final bead-bound fraction of 100-300 bp.\nPut the Lower Fraction tubes on the MPS for 5 min (room temperature).\nRemove the supernatant and centrifuge the tubes briefly to further remove the supernatant as much as possible.\nWash the beads from both Fractions twice using 200 µL of 70% ethanol and reclaim the beads for 5 min on the MPS each time.\nAfter a quick spin in a centrifuge, remove the ethanol completely and further dry the beads on the MPS.\n\t\tNOTE: Dry until the alcohol is completely evaporated. The pellet should look like dark chocolate without cracking (can take ~10 min).\nResuspend both fractions in 50 µL of 1x TLE buffer. Incubate at room temperature for 10 min and tap or flick the tubes every other minute to stimulate mixing and elution.\nSeparate the beads from the supernatant on the MPS for 5 min for both fractions.\nKeep the supernatant from each sample. Pipet the supernatant into a 1.7 mL low binding tube.\n\t\tNOTE: The samples can be kept at 4 °C for a few days or at -20 °C for long term.",
    "Run a 2% agarose gel as in Table 4 to determine the sample quality and quantity. See Figure 3 for an example of such a gel.\n\t\tNOTE: If from experience, sonication is highly reproducible, one can skip this gel and proceed to end repair immediately. It is recommended that users hold on to the Upper Fractions until after titration PCR. Suboptimal DNA quantities that would require a lot of PCR amplification can be rescued from material in the Upper Fraction.\nQuantify the amount of DNA from the gel directly after generating a standard curve from the known DNA ladder input or by using a Qubit or Nanodrop.\nEnd repair\n\t\nPrepare the end repair mix as in Table 7 (amount per reaction given).\nTransfer the remaining 46 µL of eluted DNA from the Lower Fraction to PCR tubes and add 24 µL of the prepared end repair mix.

Use 2 µL for each 1 µg of Hi-C DNA but no less than 10 µL.\nMix the streptavidin-coated beads and pipet the volume of beads needed for each library (calculated in the previous step) into individual 1.7 mL low binding tubes.\nResuspend the beads in 400 µL of Tween wash buffer (TWB; see recipe in Supplemental Table S1) and incubate for ~3 min at room temperature on a rotator (see instructions in step 3.3.4).",

After cleaning and size-selection, PCR products (Hi-C) were loaded next to a ClaI-digested fraction of the same library (ClaI). ClaI-digested fragments indicate the presence of sought-after DpnII-DpnII ligations. Note that ClaI does not digest DpnII-DdeI junctions and, therefore, not all ligations will contribute to a size reduction from this restriction.
