    "Harvest leaves from of 3-4 weeks old Arabidopsis or tobacco seedlings (better if seedlings were kept in dark for 12 h before, to minimize the starch) and collect them in chilled water. Let them in cold room for at least 30 min.Grind leaves 3 times in 100 to 400 ml HB buffer, using a Waring blender homogeniser (1 time high, 5 sec; 3 times low, 3 sec).Filter the homogenate immediately through two cheese cloth and one miracloth.Centrifuge the filtrate 2 min at 2,200 rpm at 4 °C in JA-14 rotor.Resuspend the pellet in the 3 ml of HB buffer and quantify the chlorophyll. Adjust the volume to 50 ml with HB buffer and centrifuge at 4 °C at 3,600 rpm for 2 min.Resuspend the chloroplast pellet from the chloroplast prep in 0.6 M sucrose in TE buffer to a concentration of 1-2 mg/ml chlorophyll.Note: Chlorophyll content is measured by diluting 5-10 μl of resuspended chloroplasts into 1 ml of 80% acetone. Mix well and spin for 2 min in the microfuge. Remove the supernatant and measure against a blank of 80% acetone in a quartz cuvette at 652 nm.  Chlorophyll concentration in mg/ml = OD652 x dilution factor/36Freeze the chloroplast suspension at -80 °C for 1-2 h.Thaw the suspension and dilute with at least 3 volumes of TE buffer.Homogenize for 20 strokes in a Potter homogenizer with a pestle.Spin the lysed chloroplasts at 39,000 rpm for 1 hour at 4 °C. Remove the brownish supernatant (stroma) by pipetting and store it in frozen at -20 °C for 30 min.Resuspend the pellet in 45% sucrose in TE buffer to a concentration of 2-3 mg chlorophyll/ml. Homogenize the pellet in a Potter homogenizer for 20 strokes as given above.",
    "The membranes may be stored at -20 °C at this point for later fractionation.Pipette the resuspended membranes into a polycarbonate UltraClear SW28 tube. Membranes were overlaid with a linear sucrose gradient created using 15 ml 5% sucrose and 15 ml of 45% sucrose in TE buffer and centrifuged for 17 h at 100,000 x g and 4 °C (SW41Ti rotor).Collect 1 ml of fractions from the gradient. The fractions can be stored at -20 °C. Starting from the top of the gradient (fraction 1) and ending at the bottom (approximately 32 fractions) plastoglobules are present in the fractions 1-6; envelopes are in fractions 14-18, and thylakoid membranes in fractions 25-32. Nevertheless, the exact chloroplast membrane distribution could be checked by immunoblotting with anti-PGL35 (plastoglobules), anti-TOC75 (envelopes) and anti-LHCB2 (thylakoid membranes).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140901/20140901001951_1327.jpgFigure 1. Purification of plastoglobules by flotation centrifugation. Total membranes from isolated chloroplasts were separated by flotation on a continuous sucrose gradient. Plastoglobules are visible as a yellowish green layer at the top of the gradient. THY, thylakoid membranes; PG, plastoglobules."
