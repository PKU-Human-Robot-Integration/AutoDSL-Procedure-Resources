    "The study protocol complied with the Declaration of Helsinki, and all patients provided written informed consent before participating in the study. Skin samples are obtained from healthy women undergoing abdominoplasty in the Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery Department at Geneva University Hospitals (Geneva, Switzerland). The procedure conforms to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local institutional ethics committee (protocol #3126).\n1. Preparation of PRP\nNOTE: The CuteCell-PRP tubes (Table of Materials) are designed for the rapid preparation of PRP from a small volume of the patient’s blood in a closed circuit system.\nCollection of whole blood\n\tNOTE: Harvest autologous blood from a peripheral vein of the arm using a butterfly needle directly connected to the PRP tube, according to the collection protocol of the medical institute. Blood can be directly withdrawn through the venous cannula if the patient is under anesthesia.\n\t\nOpen the tube blister pack. Perform the venous puncture and fill the desired number of PRP tubes with whole blood. The vacuum within the tubes will enable automatic collection of the necessary volume of blood (~10 mL).\nCarefully turn the tubes upside down several times to mix the blood with anticoagulant.\nInside a biosafety cabinet (class 2), remove 100 µL of total whole blood using a 1 mL syringe for further blood cell number counts.\nCentrifugation\n\tNOTE: Ensure that the centrifuge is correctly balanced before starting it.\n\t\nOnce the blood is collected in the PRP tubes, if necessary, prepare a counterbalance tube (supplied separately) with water to the same level as the blood in the PRP tube. Place the filled tubes in the centrifuge opposite each other, ensuring that the machine is balanced.\nCentrifuge samples at 1,500 x g for 5 min.",
    "NOTE: Set the corresponding rpm speed according to the centrifuge manufacturer’s instructions. After centrifugation, the blood will become fractionated. The red and white blood cells are trapped under the gel, and platelets settle on the surface of the gel (Figure 1).\nGently invert the PRP tube 20x to resuspend the platelet deposit in the plasma supernatant.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that the platelets are fully detached from the gel. The plasma should change from clear and transparent to turbid. If platelet aggregates are present, they should be collected with the plasma.\nTo collect PRP, take the plasma solution from the tube using a syringe transfer device connected to a 10 mL syringe.\n\tNOTE: About 5 mL of PRP will be obtained from each tube. The PRP solution is now ready to mix in the final medium preparation. The solution can be kept at room temperature (RT) under the safety cabinet until the future steps involving hematology analyzer and use.\nBefore using the PRP, determine the platelet concentration, mean platelet volume, and number of red and white blood cells using an automated hematology analyzer (Table of material). To do so, carefully withdraw 100 µL of the solution and transfer into a 1.5 mL tube.\n\tNOTE: PRP is used as an autologous culture supplement at a concentration between 5–20% v/v. The optimal concentration of PRP needs to be determined for each cell line. To prevent fibrin clot formation, the final culture media should be supplemented with 2 U/mL heparin.\n2. Isolation of autologous fibroblasts and culture in FBS- or PRP-supplemented media\nWash skin samples in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) by gently shaking in a 50 mL polypropylene tube.",
    "If the skin sample is relatively large (>10 cm2), place the sample on the lid of a 150 cm2 tissue culture dish (epidermal side down). Remove the subcutaneous fat tissue using a pair of forceps and scissors. To prevent the tissue from drying out, rinse the tissue every few minutes in PBS.\n\tNOTE: Use smaller tissue culture dish for smaller samples.\nWhen fat trimming is complete, cut the tissue into approximately 0.5 cm x 1.5 cm strips using a sterile scalpel.\nAdd 5 mL of collagenase-dispase mix (Table of Materials; 14 Wünsch units/mL) to a sterile 15 mL tube.\nTransfer the cut tissue to the tube, ensuring that the tissue pieces are submerged in the solution. Cap the tube securely.\nPlace the tubes in an incubator at 37 °C with orbital shaking for 150 min. After incubation, place the tube containing the tissue in the biosafety cabinet.\nPlace the lid of a sterile 100 mm culture dish upside down in the biosafety cabinet. Transfer the digested tissue solution to the bottom of the 100 mm culture dish, without splashing. If any pieces of tissue remain in the tube, use a sterile 1 mL pipette or sterile forceps to transfer the tissue pieces to the bottom of the 100 mm culture dish.\nWith the epidermis strip facing up, separate the intact epidermis sheet from the dermis by using two pairs of forceps. Hold the dermis of the tissue strip with a pair of forceps and the edge of the epidermis with another pair of forceps. Peel the dermis and epidermis apart in two pieces, keeping the separated pieces on the same lid. Try to perform this step quickly and repeat the manipulation for each piece of tissue.\nTransfer the dermal pieces to a new 100 mm culture dish containing PBS.",
    "Using laboratory forceps, place the dermal pieces in a 15 mL polypropylene tube with 3 mL of 0.3% trypsin/PBS. Incubate for 10-20 min in a 37 °C water bath and invert the tube several times every 2−3 min.\nTo stop the enzymatic reaction, add 3−5 mL of ice-cold complete growth medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium [DMEM] or RPMI containing 10% FBS). Vortex the tube vigorously several times. Filter the fibroblast suspension through an 85 μm nylon mesh (placed over the top of a 50 mL tube) to remove dermal debris.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 150 x g, at 4 °C. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 100−1,000 μL of complete growth medium.\nUsing trypan blue (dilution factor of x2) mixed with the cell suspension, count the number of total and viable cells by filling the chamber of the haemocytometer.\n\tNOTE: Cell viability depends on the conditions used for enzymatic digestion. To increase cell recovery and cell viability, the skin sample may be cut into smaller pieces.\nPlate 3−10 x 104 cells in 5 mL of complete FBS growth medium (DMEM, 10% FBS heat-inactivated for 60 min at 56 °C, 1% 1 M HEPES buffer solution, 1% 100x nonessential amino acid mixture, 1% 100x L-glutamine, 1% 100x penicillin/streptomycin, 1% 100x sodium pyruvate) in a 25 cm2 tissue culture flask. Incubate at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: Viable fibroblasts will attach to the flask within 24 h and begin to exhibit the spindle-shape in 2−3 days.\nOn day 2, aspirate the medium containing nonadherent cells and add fresh medium.\n\tNOTE: As dead cells in the culture medium affect the growth of viable fibroblasts, nonadherent, dead cells must be removed from the culture.\nChange the medium every 3−4 days until the culture reaches 70−80% confluency.",
    "To harvest fibroblasts, wash with PBS and incubate with trypsin/EDTA solution for 3 min at 37 °C in the incubator.\nTo stop the reaction, add 3−5 mL of warm complete growth medium (DMEM or RPMI containing 10% FBS). Take an aliquot of the cell suspension to count the cells with the haemocytometer. Centrifuge the suspension for 5 min at 200 x g and remove the medium by aspiration.\nCulture the fibroblast in PRP medium (DMEM, 20% PRP, 1% 1 M HEPES buffer solution, 1% 100x nonessential amino acid mixture, 1% 100x L-glutamine, 1% 100x penicillin/streptomycin, 1% 100x sodium pyruvate, 2 U/mL heparin) in the incubator at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: The minimum cell density recommended is 4,000 viable cells/cm2.\nTo assess PRP effects on fibroblast proliferation, seed fibroblasts (passage 2) in 24 well plates at a density of 8 x 103 cells per well in PRP medium with different PRP concentrations (1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50%) and with 2 U/mL heparin or under classical culture medium conditions (10% FBS). After 7 days of culture, add a vital dye (cell proliferation violet) to cells and assess the proliferation by flow cytometry.\nTo study cytoskeletal rearrangements, seed cells in 96 well black/clear flat bottom plates at a concentration of 1 x 105 cells/mL in complete FBS growth DMEM (see step 2.14) supplemented with 0.5% FBS for 24 h. Treat cells with 10% FBS or different PRP concentrations (1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50%) for 7 days.",
    "Fix the fibroblasts with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilize with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min at RT. Stain the fibroblasts with 50 mL of 5 U/mL phalloidin, wash 2x with PBS, and mark with 50 mL of 1 mg/mL 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 5 min. Cytation 3 cell imaging multimode reader (BioTek) was used to visualize phalloidin staining.\nSubscription Required.
