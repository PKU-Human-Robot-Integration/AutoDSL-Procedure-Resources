    "The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principle and was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tsinghua University. Figure 1 shows the process of evaluating the keyboard design of smartphones.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61796/61796fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: General process of conducting a keyboard experiment and evaluating the keyboard design.

Preparation\nExperiment design\nDefine the research issue and propose the hypothesis.\nDesign the experiment according to the hypothesis and define the independent variables (e.g., keyboard layout, typing posture). Use the within-subject design in order to reduce confounding factors and variance caused by the difference among participants.\nDependent variables\nUse physical data, including the hand length, the length of input finger, and the circumference of input finger, which were measured by a tape measure, as shown in Figure 2.\nUse physiological data, including galvanic skin response (measured by the portable wireless physiological detector), heart rate (measured by the portable wireless physiological detector), electromyographic activity (measured by surface electromyography), etc.\nUse input performance: word per minute, word error rate, and transition time between two keys.\n\t\t\nWord per minute refers to the input speed of participants (i.e., the number of correct-inputted words per minute).\nWord error rate refers to the input accuracy of participants (i.e., the number of incorrect-inputted words divided by the total number of words under one condition). Corrected error rate, uncorrected error rate, and total error rate have also been used in previous studies36.\nTransition time between two keys refers to the reaction time of participants between two touchpoints of a correct-inputted word22 (i.e., the start time of the second touchpoint minus the departure time of the first character).\nUse body-movement data such as hand gesture and body (finger) movement. They could be collected by the motion capture system35.",
    "Use subjective data such as perceived usability, intent to use, perceived accuracy and speed, perceived exertion and pain, and subjective workload, etc. Subjective data can be obtained through existing scales and questionnaires, which are highly reliable as well as valid to better evaluate the subjective feedback of participants about the keyboard design.\n\t\t\nUse NASA-TLX, a 21-point scale that is used to measure subjective workload through mental, physical, time, performance, effort, and frustration dimensions. A high score indicates a high subjective workload26.\nUse the System Usability Scale, a 5-point questionnaire with 10 items, and the responses of one participant will be calculated as a single score from 0 to 100. A high score indicates a high perceived usability24.\nUse the Borg CR10 Scale, which is ranged from 0 to 10 to measure perceived pain and exertion. A high score indicates a high-level perceived pain and exertion25.\nUse the Intent to Use Scale: a 10-point questionnaire that is used to measure the likelihood that participants would use the technology or products. A high score indicates a high-level likelihood28.\nPerceived speed and perceived accuracy are all measured by 50-point scales, and a high score indicates a good perceived performance28.\nCollect the coordinate data of each touchpoint and change it into the fitted ellipse (95% CI) of touchpoints on each button30,31. Adopt the area of each fitted ellipse and the offset from the center of the fitted ellipse to the target center of each button as dependent variables.\n\t\tNOTE: The coordinate data can be precisely collected by the self-developed application on the smartphone. If it is hard to obtain the coordinate data, objective and subjective data are sufficient to roughly evaluate the keyboard design.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61796/61796fig2v4.jpg\nFigure 2: The measurement of the hand.

    "Choose the experiment smartphone. Take weight, resolution, and screen size into consideration.\nDesign and develop the experiment software on smartphones (optional step).\n\t\tNOTE: Transition time between two keys can be recorded automatically by this software or motion capture sensors (i.e., the accelerometer sensor). It may be difficult to collect it manually (e.g., a clock or stopwatch).\nSelect the input task from the following suggestions based on the hypothesis and revise it to match the research purpose.\n\t\t\nFor the character pair input task, randomly pair 26 English letters into 676 pairs and averagely divide them into several groups based on the experiment design.\nFor the phrase (sentence) input task, use phrases that are moderate in length, easy to remember, and representative of the target language. If the target language is English, extract 15–20 (or based on research purpose) phrases or words from a 500 phrases set37.\nParticipant recruitment\nUse the G*Power software to calculate the sample size.\nPost questionnaires to recruit potential participants.\nFilter potential participants with wanted characteristics, e.g., age, health, vision, handedness, and input experience. Ensure that the input experience of participants is balanced.\n2. Procedure\nRead out the informed consent form of the experiment to participants, including the experiment procedure, task, and whether they will encounter any mental or physical injuries. If participants agree to participate, they need to sign the informed consent form. If not, they can immediately withdraw. According to the informed consent form, participants can also withdraw at any stage of the experiment.\nCollect physical as well as demographic data. Use a tape measure to measure the hand of every single participant (Figure 2) in order to eliminate the effect of the hand size difference and also provide repeatable data for future research. Collect demographic data such as age, gender, precise input experience, and occupation.",
    "Disinfect all devices and clean the body parts of the participant that will touch the devices.\n\t\nAsk participants to wash their hands and clean the screen of smartphones so that sensors of smartphones can be more sensitive.\nAsk participants to wear portable wireless physiological detectors or a motion capture system. Ask participants to wear the portable wireless physiological detection wristband on the non-dominant hand to record galvanic skin response and heart rate with the noise interference avoided.\n\t\t\nPlace passive markers of the motion capture system on the fingernails, the proximal phalanx of the finger, cervical vertebrae (C3–C5), and arm, to collect the precise body and finger movement. Stick wireless electrodes to the skin of two arms and two forearms to detect the electromyographic activity (optional step).\nCalibrate all the devices used in the experiment.\nPractice part\n\t\nLet participants complete the training task. The training task is used to improve participants' familiarity with input tasks and keyboards to reduce the effect of practice or the unfamiliarity on the experiment result. It is composed of 50 pairs or 20 words randomly selected from the 676 English pairs set or 500 phrases set. Only when their input accuracy reaches 80% or more in 150 seconds can they enter the formal trials. The exemplar research adopted inputting 50 pairs as the training task.\nMain task\n\t\nLet participants complete formal trials under all experimental conditions. They need to ensure their accuracy as quickly as possible during the time of the input task. Formal trials are real input tasks that will be evaluated and analyzed in the research. Each pair, word, or sentence represents a trial, and different experimental designs produce different experimental conditions.",
    "Have participants complete the input task in random order or a balanced order. Methods of the division of input materials are as follows. First, 676 pairs can be randomly divided into each experimental condition (i.e., participants have entered all pairs when they complete all experimental conditions). Second, under each experimental condition, 676 pairs can be divided into several blocks randomly, and participants need to complete these blocks randomly. Third, for inputting words, participants need to complete around 20 trials under each condition. Fourth, for inputting sentences, participants need to complete about 10–15 trials under each condition. Researchers should ensure no significant difference between the number of characters and the number of words entered by the participant under each condition. The exemplar research adopted the first method and had four experimental conditions.\nAfter each condition, ask participants to complete all the questionnaires (scales assessing their subjective experience) at random and give them 1 min or more to rest.\nAt the end of the experiment, let each participant finish the comprehensive questionnaire (Q & A) to obtain subjective feedback.\nExpress appreciation to participants with monetary or material rewards.\n3. Data analysis\nHypothesis testing by appropriate parametric or non-parametric tests\nAnalyze the physical, physiological, and body-movement data to test whether the difference between participants would significantly influence the results and inexpressive input experience of users (optional step).\nAnalyze the input performance of participants to test the input efficiency on the keyboard.\nAnalyze subjective data to test the perceived usability and subjective feedback of the keyboard.",
    "Figure out whether the practice effect and fatigue effect significantly influence the result. For each condition, trials are divided into two parts according to the timestamp (i.e., the first half part and the second half part). Specifically, under each condition, examine the difference of input performance between the first half part and the second half part to test whether the practice effect or fatigue effect exist.\nAnalyze the area of the fitted ellipse of touchpoints on each button as well as the offset from its center to the target center of each button (optional step).\n\t\t\nCollect all the touchpoints of each button with the software, and they roughly accord with the bivariate Gaussian distribution. The 95% confidence interval of each button in both x- and y-directions is derived through the coordinate data of each touchpoint in pixel, and the 95% confidence ellipses over a 1:1 outline of the button for each keyboard is fitted through Python scripts on pixel coordinate (see Coding File 2).\nUse fitted ellipses (95% CI) and their areas to demonstrate the dispersion of touchpoints on each button. In each button, the offset of fitted ellipse calculated by Python scripts is defined as the center point of the fitted ellipse to the target point of the button, and it could be represented from x- and y-directions (i.e., in X-axis and Y-axis, see Coding File 3).\nModeling and simulation",
    "Use the data-driven model as a function of keyboard location and orientation to predict the finger movement by Python scripts. All movements of fingers are divided into eight directions38 (the top to the bottom, the bottom to the top, the left to the right, the right to the left, the left-top to the right-bottom, the right-bottom to the left-top, the left-bottom to the right-top, the right-top to the left-bottom). For each direction, the average transition time between two keys is calculated to represent the effectiveness of finger movement, which is used to evaluate the keyboard design (optional step).\nUse linear regression analysis to build an enhanced Fitts' Law (or its extended version, FFitts’ Law) model to predict the transition time between two keys using an integrated cognitive architecture39 by Python scripts. The enhanced Fitts' Law model could provide a better prediction and evaluation on keyboard design based on its analyses on the location and effective width of keys, as well as the distance of two keys (optional step).\nSubscription Required.
