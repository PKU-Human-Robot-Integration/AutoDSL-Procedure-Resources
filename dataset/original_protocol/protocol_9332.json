  "procedures": [
    "Part 1: Preparing for slicing and culturing.\nPrepare 10-cm tissue culture plates with slicing medium (DMEM, 25% 1x HBSS, 25% fetal bovine serum, 0.5% glucose, 1 mM glutamine, 2.5 mM HEPES, pH 7.3) and 3-cm Millicell-CM 0.4-μm culture membrane inserts and keep in incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nHeat up 4% low melting point agarose in PBS in the microwave and keep it on heating plate so that it stays at approximately 37°C.\nFill 10-cm bacteriological Petri dishes with PBS (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8mM KH2PO4) and place on ice.\nSet up microtome cooling device or ensure that buffer tray and cooling elements are stored in the freezer to pre-cool it.\nPart 2: Embryo embedding.\nDissect embryos from the uterus and examine them with an inverted fluorescent microscope to check for GFP expression.\nPlace embryos on an inverted 10-cm Petri dish and orient them using Whatman paper strips to remove excessive PBS.\nApply agarose on embryo to fix it in this position. Let agarose solidify.\nLimit the area surrounding the embryo by cutting with a razor blade.\nRotate the embedded embryo onto its other side.\nApply additional agarose on embryonic tissue to ensure that the embryo is completely embedded.\nPrepare agarose block with clean edges and mount on vibratome chuck using Loctite 406, a special glue similar to \"Krazy Glue\".\nPart 3: Slicing procedure.\nSet up the precooled buffer tray and the cooling element.\nInsert the chuck with the glued tissue and add 1x HBSS (Ca2+-Mg2+-free HBSS, 10 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.3, 500 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin) until covered.\nInsert and fix a precleaned (70% Ethanol) microtome blade.\nPrepare 350 - 450 μm slices and transfer them using shortened glass pasteur pipettes into tissue culture plates kept on ice.",
    "Using a pair of forceps, carefully remove agarose from each slice and transfer to Millicell culture membranes. About 4 slices can be cultured on one membrane in a 10-cm tissue culture plate filled with 6 mL of culture medium.\nIncubate slices at 37°C and 5% CO2 (Culture medium: DMEM, 25% 1x HBSS, 25% fetal bovine serum, 0.5% glucose, 1mM glutamine, 2.5 mM HEPES, pH 7.3). If one performs time-lapse imaging series one should keep the volume of medium constant. In the case of timed imaging series for a short time frame it is sufficient to leave the medium as it is. For longer culture periods changes after 12-20 hours are recommended.\nPart 4: Imaging spinal nerve outgrowth at the microscope.\nImage spinal nerves placing a 10-cm tissue culture plate, containing Millicell culture membranes with slices, under an upright fluorescent microscope.\nLabel the orientation of Millicell culture membranes on microscope stage to position correctly during the next imaging time point.\nImage spinal nerve outgrowth using 4x (numerical aperture [NA] 0.1), 10x (NA 0.3), or 20x (NA 0.5) objectives.\nFigure 1 shows an imaging series depicting the spinal nerve outgrowth during 20 hours of culture with 4x and 10x objectives.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2309/2309fig1.jpgFigure 1 Imaging series of spinal nerve outgrowth in a transverse slice of a homozygous tauGPF embryo. * = motor neurons of the ventral spinal cord, arrow = DRG. The dorsal (D)-ventral (V) axis of the slice is indicated. Scalebars: 200 μm.Subscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
