    "NOTE: This protocol is developed for reducing the spatial heterogeneity of maltotriose and bradykinin fragment (1-7) prepared with the dried-droplet method. The protocol consists of three main steps, including preparation and preconditioning, sample deposition and drying, and mass spectrometry data analysis. The procedures are outlined and described in more detail below:\n1. Preparation and Preconditioning\nCleaning the Sample Plate\n\t\nWear nitrile gloves and hand-wash the sample plate gently with detergent and distilled-deionized water (DDW).\nRinse the sample plate with methanol (MeOH) and DDW.\nInsert the sample plate in a 600 ml beaker and fill with DDW.\nSonicate the sample plate in DDW for 15 min in an ultrasonic bath (200 W, 40 kHz).\nRemove DDW from the beaker and fill the beaker with MeOH.\nSonicate the sample plate in MeOH for 15 min in the ultrasonic bath (200 W, 40 kHz).\nBlow off the solvent drops on the plate with nitrogen gas and keep the sample plate dry before sample deposition.\nRegulating Drying Chamber Temperature\n\tNOTE: The drying chamber is a 35 x 20 x 45 cm3 (W x D x H) acrylic chamber. Figure 1 shows the picture of this drying system. The chamber is purged with room temperature nitrogen gas through a gas flowmeter at a constant flow rate to maintain a low relative humidity condition monitored by a calibrated hygrometer installed inside the drying chamber. A copper base block in the drying chamber equipped with a programmed constant temperature water circulator is used to accommodate stainless steel sample plates. The copper base block is able to regulate the sample plate temperature from 5 to 25 °C. The temperatures of air, copper base block, and the sample plate are monitored by K-type thermocouples.",
    "Open the door and rapidly put the sample plate on the copper base block then close the door.\nManually adjust the gas flowmeter to set the nitrogen flow rate to 10 standard cubic feet per hour (SCFH).\nMonitor the relative humidity in the drying chamber by the hygrometer and fine tune the gas flowmeter to ensure the relative humidity is always below 25%.\nMonitor the temperature of the sample plate by K-type thermocouples and adjust the water circulator temperature manually until the sample plate reaches 5 °C for experiment or room temperature (25 °C) for control.\n\t\tNOTE: In order to stabilize the sample plate at a designed temperature, the water circulator temperature is typically set 0 to 5 °C lower than the designed sample. For example, to maintain 5 °C at the sample plate, the temperature setting of the water circulator is in the range of 0 to 2 °C; to maintain the sample plate at 25 °C, the temperature setting of the water circulator is in the range of 23 to 25 °C.\nEnsure the required temperatures and the relative humidity are reached (Table 1) before sample deposition.\n\t\tNOTE: All parameters as well as their setting values for the drying processes with different sample plate temperatures are shown in Table 1.\n\t\tNOTE: At a low sample plate temperature, water condensation on the sample plate may occur if the chamber door is open for a long time. If water condensation occurs, close the door and DO NOT deposit any sample on it until water condensation is dried out.\nPreparation of Matrix and Analyte Solutions\n\t\nPreparation of matrix solutions\n\t\t\nPrepare 0.1 M THAP solution with 50% acetonitrile (ACN): 50% DDW aqueous solution.\nPreparation of analytes\n\t\t\nPrepare 10-4 M maltotriose solution with DDW.",
    "Prepare 10-5 M bradykinin fragment (1-7) solution in 50% acetonitrile (ACN) : 50% DDW aqueous solution.\n2. Sample Deposition and Drying\nPremix 0.25 µl of 0.1 M THAP solution and 0.25 µl of 10-4 M maltotriose or 10-5 M bradykinin fragment (1-7) solutions in a microcentrifuge tube.\nVortex the mixed solution for 3 sec.\nCentrifuge the mixed solution for 2 sec (2,000 x g) to collect the solution at the bottom of the centrifuge tube.\nOpen the door of the drying chamber, carefully deposit 0.1 µl of the solution on the sample plate with pipette and close the door immediately.\nWait for the sample droplet to dry out.\n\tNOTE: The typically observed drying times with different sample plate temperatures are listed in Table 1. For sample plate temperature of 5 °C, the average drying time is 800 to 1,000 sec; for sample plate temperature of 25 °C, the average drying time is 100 to 150 sec.\nAfter drying, open the door of the drying chamber.\nSet the water circulator temperature to room temperature (25 °C).\n\tNOTE: Skip this step if the sample plate is kept constantly at room temperature (25 °C) during the drying process.\nAfter the sample plate temperature returns to room temperature (25 °C), remove the sample plate from the drying chamber.\nExamine the sample morphology under a 5X stereomicroscope and take a snapshot bright-field image.\n\tNOTE: If the crystal morphologies are not as expected, it is necessary to prepare a new sample with the same procedure. Typical crystal morphologies are shown in the upper panels of Figure 2.",
    "NOTE: In the cases with low sample plate temperatures, such as 5 °C, it is important to warm up the sample plate to room temperature before taking it out of the drying chamber. When depositing the samples, DO NOT keep the premixed solution in the tip of the pipette over 10 sec. DO NOT use the premixed solution again after depositing the samples. The upper panels of Figure 2 show bright-field images of samples prepared with different sample plate temperatures.\n3. Mass Spectrometry Data Analysis\nMass Spectrometry Data Acquisition\n\tNOTE: After preparation, the sample can be analyzed using imaging mass spectrometry. In the current study, the imaging MS experiments are conducted using a laboratory-built synchronized dual-polarity TOF (DP-TOF) imaging mass spectrometer.15 Commercial MALDI-TOF mass spectrometers with imaging capability are also suitable for such experiments. The mass spectrometer is operated in linear extraction and positive ion modes with optimized extraction delays. The kinetic energy of ions is 20 kV. The laser beam size is 35 µm in diameter on the sample surface, and the spectrum of every spot is the average of 5 laser shots.\n\t\nInsert the sample plate into the MALDI mass spectrometer.\nPerform imaging mass spectrometry analysis to the sample prepared in steps 2.1-2.9.\nSelect a characteristic mass peak from the mass list shown in the result window and click \"2D\" to plot a two-dimensional ion image.\n\t\tNOTE: For maltotriose mixed with THAP, the characteristic peaks are sodiated maltotriose, protonated THAP, and sodiated THAP. For bradykinin fragment (1-7) mixed with THAP, the characteristic peaks include protonated bradykinin fragment (1-7), protonated THAP, and sodiated THAP.\nClick the adjustment buttons in the popup window to determine the upper and lower limits of the signal intensity and click \"save a picture\". This setting defines the contrast of ion images.",
    "NOTE: In every individual set of data, the cracked regions and the null spots showing low brightness are eliminated.\nObserve and compare the ion image with the bright-field image that was taken at step 2.9.\n\t\tNOTE: Imaging mass spectrometry and construction of images of particular ions can be achieved with commercial instruments. Due to the variety of data acquisition and analysis software, the users should follow software instructions provided by the instrument vendor to get high quality images.\nData Analysis\n\tNOTE: The heterogeneity of samples is analyzed quantitatively. In this demonstration, every sample is divided into multiple concentric areas by software developed in-house to analyze the spatial distribution of the ions. The analysis can also be performed using stand-alone data analysis software.\n\t\nClick the null spots and the cracked regions in the ion image shown in the result window to remove unimportant areas.\n\t\tNOTE: This procedure defines the essential area of ion image.\nClick \"find edge\" button to find the outmost layer of the ion image.\nClick \"deduct\" to save the ion abundance information of the outmost layer in a database and remove this layer from the ion image simultaneously. A check box representing this outmost layer will appear in the \"output data\" list of the result window.\nRepeat steps 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 until the center of the ion image is defined.\nClick and select all the check boxes in the \"output data\" list and click \"export\" to export the data.\nOpen the exported data using spreadsheet software to calculate the average ion abundance of every layer to obtain the spatial distribution information of ions.\nSubscription Required.
