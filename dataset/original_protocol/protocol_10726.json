    "1. Passivation of Glass Coverslips with PLL-PEG-biotin\nThis step is designed to passivate the surface so that cells adhere and migrate onto specific regions on the glass coverslip that are created with microcontract printing (Step 2-3a) or dip pen lithography (Step 3b). For the passivation, a co-polymer of poly-L-lysine (PLL) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) is used in which 20% of PEG molecules are grafted to biotin (PLL-PEG-biotin).\nTo clean glass coverslips (18 mm x 18 mm), submerge them in a rack in 100% ethanol and place the rack in a sonicating bath for 30 min. Dry the glass coverslips in air or under a stream of nitrogen.\nNext, sonicate the glass coverslips for 30 min in 1 M NaOH. Afterwards rinse the glass surfaces by carefully dipping the rack in a beaker filled with 1.5 L Milli-Q H2O. Repeat the rinsing process three times using fresh Milli-Q H2O each time. Dry the glass coverslips in an oven at 60 °C.\nPlace half of the clean glass coverslips individually in a humid chamber, which is made of a 24-well plate partially filled with H2O. Drop 15 μl of PLL-PEG-biotin (1 mg/ml) in PBS on each glass coverslip. Take the other half of the remaining clean glass coverslips and carefully sandwich the PEG solution. Leave the coverslips for 1 hr in the humid chamber. Slide the sandwiched coverslips gently away from each other without scraping the PEG-coated surface and rinse them with Milli-Q H2O. The water should slide off easily on the PEG-treated side. If necessary, air-dry the glass coverslips on paper towel with the treated surface facing upward. Store the glass coverslips in a vacuum desiccator until further use.\n2. Fabrication of Stamps for Microcontact Printing",
    "We describe two processes to pattern streptavidin tracks onto the passivated glass coverslips. The first one, microcontact printing, typically requires the fabrication of a silicon master from which a PDMS stamp is cast. In our case, the pattern on the PDMS stamp are 100 μm-wide lines that are spaced 290 μm center-to-center with a feature height of 25 μm. Below, we describe briefly how to fabricate a suitable silicon master (Step 2.1-2.3) and PDMS stamp (Step 2.4). However, there are multiple protocols for microcontact printing described in the literature19-23, which are suitable for printing protein patterns onto glass coverslips. Masters can also be custom made and purchased from commercial sources.\nFirst, clean the silicon wafer (4\" in diameter) by incubating it in piranha solution (3:1 v:v of sulphuric acid and 30% hydrogen peroxide) for 20 min. Rinse the wafer thoroughly 10 times with MilliQ H2O. Dry the wafer in an oven at 150 °C O/N.\nRinse the clean and dried silicon wafer with 100% acetone, followed by 100% isopropyl alcohol. Next spin-coat 2 ml of GM1070 SU-8 photoresist (Gersteltec Sarl) onto the wafer at 3,100 rpm for 40 sec to create a 25 μm thick layer. The sample is then baked on a hot plate at 65 °C for 5 min followed by a further 5 min at 95 °C.",
    "Expose the SU-8 photoresist to UV light for 60 sec under a photomask with the desired pattern (for example using a Quintel Q6000 mask aligner) and repeat the baking process describe in 2.2. Then the sample is developed by immersing the wafer in SU-8 developer (Gersteltec Sarl) for 4 min, rinsed in 100% isopropyl alcohol and dried under nitrogen flow. The area of the SU-8 photoresist that was not exposed to UV light is thus removed, creating the inverse pattern of the PDMS stamp.\nThe next step is to cast a PDMS stamp from the silicon master. First, thoroughly mix 1 part (w/w) of the curing agent with 10 parts of elastomer prepolymer (Sylgard 184). To remove any air bubbles, degas the mixture in a desiccator attached to a vacuum line for 1 hr. Next, pour the PDMS elastomer onto the silicon master inside a Petri dish to about 1 cm in height and cure the master and PDMS mixture in an oven at 70 °C for 1 hr. Finally, the PDMS stamp is removed from the silicon master and cut to size.\n3. Patterning Streptavidin or Adhesive Cues onto Passivated Glass Coverslips\nAfter passivating glass coverslips, protein patterns are printed with microcontact printing (Step 3a) or dip-pen lithography (Step 3b). In our case, streptavidin is printed as lines, which form the basis for RGD gradients (Step 4). The same procedure can also be used for printing matrix proteins to create adhesive patterns.",
    "An alternative method to microcontact printing for the patterning of biomolecules onto surfaces is dip pen lithography. In dip pen lithography, a cantilever is used to transfer a small volume of solution onto the surface. The size of the cantilevers, viscosity of the solution, contact time of the cantilever on the surface, hydrophobicity of the surface and humidity in the printing chamber determine the size of the printed features. The advantage of this method is that different patterns can be printed for each experiment, as there is no need to fabricate masters and stamps. The disadvantage is that it takes longer to print a given pattern and that dip pen lithography requires a specialist instrument that may not be available in many laboratories. The dip pen lithography instrument that we used was the NanoeNabler from Bioforce Nanoscience. Here, we printed small dots that were <10 μm in diameter, for which we used SPT10 cantilevers.\n3a. Microcontact Printing (μCP) Technique\nTo clean and make the PDMS stamp more hydrophilic, treat the patterned side of the PDMS stamps in an UV and ozone (for example, UV Ozone Procleaner from Bioforce Nanoscience) for 1.5 hr. Alternatively, use a plasma cleaner for a shorter time for the same purpose. This process creates an oxidized PDMS surface24, which improves the printing process.\nImmediately after the ozone or plasma treatment, place and spread 10 μl streptavidin (1 mg/ml in PBS) onto the PDMS stamps and leave for 1 hr in a humid chamber (such as a partially filled 6-well plate, see Step 1.3). If tracks should be visible under the fluorescent microscope, use streptavidin that is conjugated to a fluorophore such as streptavidin-AlexaFluor350.",
    "Remove excess streptavidin from the stamp with tissue paper and air dry the stamp for approximately 1 min. Lightly press the stamp onto the PLL-PEG-biotin-coated glass coverslip.\nIf fluorescent streptavidin was used in Step 3.a2, examine the pattern using under an epifluorescence microscope. Store printed surfaces in a desiccator.\n3b. Dip Pen Lithography\nFirst, mix 1 part of 1 mg/ml streptavidin or streptavidin-AlexaFluor350 with 10 parts of glycerol (v/v) and load 5 μl of the mixture onto the cantilever. Then begin the printing process as described in the operation manual of the dip pen lithography instrument. To reduce the spot size to approximately 5 μm, adjust printing speed, contact time of the cantilever on the surface or vertical distance of the cantilever to the surface. In the example shown in Figure 2c, dots were printed in a line with row and column separation set to 10-15 μm. This distance is sufficient to prevent dots from merging into each other but allows the viewing of multiple dots in a single field of view with most microscope settings.\nStore printed surfaces in a desiccator.\n4. Creating Adhesive Gradients onto Streptavidin-pattern Surfaces\nWe create adhesive gradients of biotin-RGD onto glass coverslips that are coated with streptavidin (Figure 3) or contain streptavidin patterns on passivated glass coverslips (Figure 5). To create a surface gradient, we used a commercially available microfluidic device (called sticky-Slide Chemotaxis 3D from Ibidi) that creates a stable solution gradient by passive diffusion. To compete for streptavidin binding sites, we employed two opposing gradients of biotin-RGD and biotin that was not conjugated to RGD (see Figure 1).",
    "Adhere the streptavidin-coated or -patterned glass coverslips onto the sticky side of the sticky-Slide Chemotaxis 3D device. To ensure that there is no leakage for several hours, the edges of the device are sealed with a thin layer of warmed Vaseline and with a second layer of a mixture of 1 part of Vaseline to 1 part of paraffin wax (w/w).\nFill the channel of the device with 6 μl PBS in the channel. Then fill the two reservoirs with 70 μl of 0.03 μg/μl biotin-4-fluorescein in PBS and 70 μl of 0.03 μg/μl biotin-RGD in PBS, respectively. Incubate the samples at RT in the dark for 1 hr.\nRemove the biotin solutions and carefully rinse the surface while still attached to the microfluidic device twice with PBS. Mark the direction of the adhesive gradient and if needed, store the device filled with PBS at 4 °C for but ensure that the device does not dry out. If required, analyze the adhesive gradient with a fluorescent microscope.\n5. Labelling of Cells with Fluorophores for Live Cell Imaging\nCells are labelled with fluorescent dyes that assist cell tracking under the fluorescent microscope. Common probes are fluorescent organelle markers, such Syto 64 Red, which labels the cell nucleus. To do so, cells are first washed three times with PBS, then incubated with 1 μM Syto 64 Red in culture media for 45 min and finally washed a further three times with PBS. Please note that cells should not be kept in PBS for long periods of time.",
    "Alternative dyes for cell tracking are CellTracker series that stain the cytoplasm and are retained during cell migration and division. Transfection of cells with fluorescent fusion protein is particularly useful to record the subcellular distributions of a protein of interest during migration. However, fluorescent proteins typically photo-bleach faster than organic dyes so that long-term observations may not be possible.\n6. Loading of Cells with a Soluble Gradient into the Microfluidics Device\nCount fluorescently labelled cells and split into two tubes of equal cell numbers. Wash and resuspend one tube of cells with media containing the chemoattractant, such as low glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Wash and resuspend the other tube of cells in media without the chemoattractant, i.e. DMEM with 0% FBS. The final concentration of cells in each tube should be 5 x 105 cells/ml.\nRemove all the solutions from the microfluidic device (from Step 4.3) and place it on the microscope stage (see Step 7). Load 70 μl of cells (5 x 105 cells/ml in 0% FBS DMEM) into one reservoir and 70 μl of HeLa cells (5 x 105 cells/ml in 10% FBS DMEM) into another. Loosely place a tape over the reservoirs to avoid evaporation. If cells on the surface are pre-incubated prior to imaging, it is advisable that the cells are loaded into the device in growth media without the gradient. The device is then placed on the microscope stage and the media replaced with gradient media i.e. DMEM without FBS in one reservoir and DMEM with 10% FBS in the other.\n7. Live Cell Imaging and Data Analysis\nSwitch on the microscope (Nikon Ti-E) and warm up the stage at least 1 hr before starting the experiment.",
    "Ensure that the channel of the microfluidic device is in the field of view and cells are in focus. Select image acquisition parameter such as exposure times and fluorescent filters, image sequence of bright field and fluorescence that captures cells and tracks as well as time points and recording length (e.g. every 15 min for 16 hr).\nAnalyze data with appropriate softwares such as ImageJ Manual Tracking or Ibidi Chemotaxis and Migration Tool.\nSubscription Required.
