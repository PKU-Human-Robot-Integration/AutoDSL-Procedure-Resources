    "All human tissue specimens collected for research were obtained according to the Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved protocol. The protocols outlined below were performed in a sterile human tissue culture environment. Informed written consent was obtained from human subjects. Eligible patients had to have a diagnosis or presumed diagnosis of ovarian cancer, be willing and able to sign informed consent, and be at least 18 years of age. Tumor tissue (malignant primary tumor or metastatic sites), ascites, and pleural fluid were obtained from consenting patients at the time of their procedure. These specimens were immediately transported to the laboratory and processed for organoid generation using the methods outlined below.\n1. Media preparation\nComplete organoid media preparation\n\t\nPrepare R-spondin 1/Noggin conditioned medium following a previously published report7.\n\t\tNOTE: R-spondin-1/Noggin conditioned medium is a more affordable alternative to commercially available recombinant proteins. HEK293T cells stably secreting R-spondin-1 and Noggin via lentivirus-mediated transduction were a generous gift from Ron Bose, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and Anil Rustgi, New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center8,9,10. Commercial conditioned medium could be used as a substitute (see Table of Materials).\nTo make the complete organoid medium, combine 10% R-spondin 1/Noggin conditioned medium, 50 ng/mL EGF, 10 ng/mL FGF-10, 10 ng/mL FGF2, 1x B27, 10 mmol/L nicotinamide, 1.25 mmol/L N-acetylcysteine, 1 µmol/L prostaglandin E2, 10 µmol/L SB202190, 500 nmol/L A83-01, and 10 µM ROCK inhibitor (see Table of Materials).\n\t​NOTE: The medium may be stored at 4 °C for up to 3 months. This medium was adapted from Hill et al.11. The concentrations and ingredients of the medium are the same, with the addition of a ROCK inhibitor.",
    "Prepare organoid base medium by combining 500 mL of an advanced formulation of DMEM/F12 with 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1x dipeptide, L-alanyl-L-glutamine, and 1x HEPES (10 mM) (see Table of Materials).\n2. Harvesting organoids from ascites and pleural fluid\nNOTE: Ascites and pleural fluid must be processed as soon as possible for the best yield of organoids. Thaw previously aliquoted BME, DNase I, and DNase I reaction buffer (see Table of Materials) by placing it on ice until the contents are liquefied.\nObtain ascites and pleural fluid from consenting patients at the time of standard care surgeries or procedures, and transport at room temperature in a travel container to the laboratory.\n\tNOTE: All ascites or pleural fluid processing should be performed in a sterile environment.\nTransfer 50 mL of ascites or pleural fluid to 50 mL conical tubes (the number of tubes depends on the volume of ascites obtained). Centrifuge at 1,650 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, use a glass Pasteur pipette to carefully aspirate the supernatant.\nContinue by adding 50 mL of ascites or pleural fluid to the previously centrifuged pellet, and centrifuge again at 1,650 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Carefully aspirate the supernatant using a glass Pasteur pipette. Repeat this step until all the ascites or pleural fluid have been processed.\nPrepare a 100 µg/mL DNase I solution by combining 1,000 µL of nuclease-free water, 100 µL of DNase I reaction buffer, and 10 µL of DNase I.\n\tNOTE: The DNase I treatment applied is sufficient to make a single-cell suspension regardless of the presence of cell aggregates in some patient samples12.",
    "Resuspend each cell pellet in 1 mL of 100 µg/mL DNase I solution. Gently add the DNase I solution dropwise, and allow the tube to incubate for 15 min at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: Add a minimum of 1 mL of DNase I solution. If 1 mL is not enough to disturb the pellet, add an additional 1 mL.\nAfter incubation, add 25 mL of organoid base medium (step 1.3) to the cells, and gently invert to mix. Then, centrifuge at 1,650 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, carefully aspirate the supernatant using a glass Pasteur pipette.\nResuspend the newly formed cell pellets in pre-warmed 5 mL of 1x red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer (see Table of Materials). Set the vortex to 458 x g, and vortex the solutions in each conical tube. Once the solutions are homogenous, use a serological pipet to combine the contents of all the conical tubes into a single 50 mL conical tube.\nIncubate the conical tube containing the vortexed solution at room temperature for 5 min. Once incubation is complete, centrifuge at 1,650 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: Examine the pellet. A pink/red pellet indicates the presence of RBCs, which would require the RBC lysis buffer step to be repeated until the pellet is no longer red.\nAfter centrifugation, carefully aspirate the supernatant using a glass Pasteur pipette. Then, wash the pellet with 10 mL of PBS, vortex the solution at 458 x g, and centrifuge at 1,650 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.",
    "If a large cell pellet is formed, aspirate the PBS using a glass Pasteur pipette, and add 1 mL of organoid base medium (step 1.3) on top of the pellet. Vortex the solution at 458 x g, and transfer 300-400 µL to a microcentrifuge tube. Centrifuge the microcentrifuge tube at 1,650 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: The portion of the cell pellet not placed in the microcentrifuge tube can be frozen down for future use (500 µL of cells to 1 mL of 10% DMSO in FBS). The frozen cell pellet can be stored for weeks at −80 °C and for years if placed in liquid nitrogen13.\nCarefully aspirate the organoid base medium (step 1.3) using a glass Pasteur pipette, and resuspend in BME (see Table of Materials) using cold tips.\n\tNOTE: The amount of BME is based on the size of the pellet. It is recommended to use 25% organoid base medium (step 1.3) with resuspended cells to 75% BME.\nPlate 40 µL aliquots of the resuspended cell solution onto a 6-well plate. Plate up to five aliquots per well (Figure 1).\nImmediately place the plate in a 37 °C incubator for 20 min to allow the BME to solidify. After incubation, gently add 2 mL of complete organoid medium (step 1.2) into each well.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64878/64878fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Plating of patient-derived ovarian cancer organoids.

Harvesting organoids from tissue\nNOTE: Tissue must be processed as soon as possible for the best yield of organoids.\nCollect and transport the tumor on ice in a travel container containing PBS.",
    "Place the sample on a 10 cm tissue culture dish (Figure 2). Using a disposable scalpel, mince the tissue. Next, using the dull end of a disposable syringe, crush the tissue until a homogenous mixture has been created.\nUsing forceps, place the homogenous tissue mixture into a dissociation tube. For every 1-2 mL of homogenized tissue, add 7-8 mL of 1 mg/mL type II collagenase solution (see Table of Materials) in organoid base medium (step 1.3) and 1 mL of DNase I solution. Vortex the solution at 458 x g.\n\tNOTE: The amount of tissue will determine the amount of collagenase solution and the number of tubes needed.\nUse the dissociation machine (see Table of Materials) to liquefy the tissue while it is in the collagenase solution. Run the program 37C_h_TDK3 (1 h) until it is a single-cell suspension.\n\tNOTE: The program will need to be rerun if the resulting mixture is not homogenous (i.e., if tissue pieces are still present in the mixture). If the tissue is digested but the solution is viscous, dilute using organoid base medium (step 1.3).\nTransfer the homogenized mixture to a new 50 mL conical tube, and add 20-40 mL of organoid base medium (step 1.3). Then, filter the solution through a 100 µm cell strainer into a newly labeled 50 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge the filtered mixture at 1,650 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Then, carefully aspirate the supernatant using a glass Pasteur pipette.\nPrepare a 100 µg/mL DNase I solution by combining 1,000 µL of nuclease-free water, 100 µL of DNase I reaction buffer, and 10 µL of DNase I.\n\tNOTE: The DNase I treatment applied is sufficient to make a single-cell suspension regardless of the presence of cell aggregates in some patient samples12.",
    "Resuspend the cells in 1 mL of 100 ug/mL DNase I solution. Gently add the DNase I solution dropwise, and allow the tube to incubate for 15 min at room temperature.\nAfter incubation, add 25 mL of organoid base medium (step 1.3) to the cells, and gently invert to mix. Then, centrifuge at 1,650 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, carefully aspirate the supernatant using a glass Pasteur pipette.\nResuspend the newly formed cell pellet in 5 mL of pre-warmed 1x RBC lysis buffer. Vortex the solutions in each conical tube at 458 x g.\nIncubate the conical tube containing the cell pellet resuspended in the RBC lysis buffer for 5 min. Once the incubation is complete, centrifuge at 1,650 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: Examine the pellet. A pink/red pellet indicates the presence of RBCs, which would require the RBC lysis buffer step to be repeated until the pellet appears white.\nAfter centrifugation, carefully aspirate the supernatant using a glass Pasteur pipette. Then, wash the pellet with 10 mL of PBS, vortex the solution at 458 x g, and centrifuge at 1,650 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nIf a large cell pellet is formed, aspirate the PBS using a glass Pasteur pipette, and add 1 mL of organoid base medium (step 1.3) on top of the pellet. Vortex the solution at 458 x g, and transfer 300-400 µL to a microcentrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 1,650 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.",
    "NOTE: The portion of the cell pellet not placed in the microcentrifuge tube can be frozen down for future use (500 µL of cells to 1 mL of 10% DMSO in FBS) (step 5.1). The frozen cell pellet can be stored for weeks at −80 °C and for years if placed in liquid nitrogen13.\nCarefully aspirate the organoid base medium using a glass Pasteur pipette, and resuspend in BME using cold tips.\n\tNOTE: The amount of BME is based on the size of the pellet. Adding 25% organoid base medium (step 1.3) with resuspended cells to 75% BME is recommended.\nPlate the resuspended cell solution onto a 6-well plate in 40 µL aliquots. Plate up to five aliquots per well.\nImmediately place the well plate in the incubator for 20 min. After incubation, gently add 2 mL of complete organoid medium (step 1.2) into each well.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64878/64878fig02v2.jpg\nFigure 2: Tumor tissue prior to dissection.

Passaging of organoids\nNOTE: If the sample is confluent, each organoid well can be passaged weekly to two new wells.\nUtilizing a 1 mL pipette, add 1 mL of organoid base medium (step 1.3) to each well, and pipette the media up and down directly onto the organoid tabs to dissociate it. Collect all the medium containing the resuspended pellets in a 15 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge the 15 mL conical tube containing the mixture at 1,650 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Then, carefully aspirate the supernatant using a glass Pasteur pipette.",
    "Add 1 mL of animal origin-free, recombinant enzyme (see Table of Materials) to the cell pellet, vortex the solution at 458 x g, and transfer to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Allow the tube to incubate for 15 min in a 37 °C water bath.\nAfter incubation, centrifuge at 1,650 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Then, carefully aspirate the supernatant using a glass Pasteur pipette.\nResuspend the pellet in BME.\n\tNOTE: The amount of BME is based on the size of the pellet. Adding 25% organoid base media (step 1.3) with resuspended cells to 75% BME is recommended.\nPlate the resuspended cell solution into a 6-well plate in 40 µL aliquots. Plate up to five aliquots per well. Once all the aliquots have been plated, immediately place the well plate in the incubator for 20 min. After incubation, gently add 2 mL of complete organoid medium (step 1.2) into each well.\n5. Freezing and thawing of organoids\nFreezing of organoids\n\t\nBegin with steps 4.1-4.4.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 0.5-1 mL of recovery cell culture freezing medium (see Table of Materials), and transfer 1 mL to each cryovial.\nThen, place the cryovials in an isopropanol-filled container at −80 °C for up to 2 weeks before transferring them to a liquid nitrogen tank for long-term storage13.\nThawing of organoids\n\t\nRemove the samples from the liquid nitrogen tank, and thaw at 37 °C water bath.\nOnce thawed, transfer to a 15 mL conical tube, and centrifuge at 1,650 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, carefully aspirate the supernatant using a glass Pasteur pipette.\nResuspend the pellet in BME.",
    "NOTE: The amount of BME is based on the size of the pellet. Adding 25% organoid base media (step 1.3) with resuspended cells to 75% BME is recommended.\nPlate the resuspended cell solution onto a 6-well plate in 40 µL aliquots. Place up to five aliquots per well.\nImmediately place the plate in the incubator for 20 min. After incubation, gently add 2 mL of complete organoid medium (step 1.2) to the wells.\n6. Embedding and generating formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) slides to evaluate the organoid composition\nAfter culturing organoids for at least 10 days to ensure adequate size, remove the complete organoid medium from the wells, and add 1 mL of 2% paraformaldehyde fixative (PFA). Incubate at room temperature for 5-10 min.\nAfter incubation, wash the cultured organoid aliquots 3x for 5 min each time with 1 mL of PBS.\nRemove the PBS from each well, and add 1 mL of warm 2% agar in deionized H2O to each well. When adding the agar, lift the cultured organoid aliquots from the plate using a spatula.\n\tNOTE: It is important not to let the agar harden before lifting the cultured organoid aliquots.\n\t\nAllow the agar to solidify in the well at room temperature.\nUsing a small spatula, free the solidified agar from the well, and store it in a cassette for up to 48 h (see Table of Materials) at 4 °C in 70% ethanol until processing14.\nEmbed the samples in paraffin15, cut the slides to a thickness of 5 µm, and stain the slides with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E, see Table of Materials) staining using a standard protocol15.\nSubscription Required.
