    "Sterilize surgical area with ethanol and sterilize tools in bead bath of at least 325 °C for 30 s. Rest sterile tools, sutures, and blade on sterile gauze.Warm Heat Therapy Pump pad to 41 °C and warm the Isothermal pad in microwave for 1 min. Place a new, clean home cage on the Heat Therapy Pump pad. Place a laboratory paper towel over the warm Isothermal pad and cover with sterile Press’n Seal and surgery board.To induce anesthesia, put the mouse in the beaker chamber with paper towel on lid containing 1 ml of isoflurane (Figure 1) and wait for approximately 30 s or until the mouse can no longer right itself. Alternatively, an isoflurane induction chamber that is included with the isoflurane dispenser can be used to induce anesthesia.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190113/20190113192421_9909.jpgFigure 1. Brief inhalational anesthesia. The mouse was briefly anesthetized by inhalation in chamber with 1 ml isoflurane.Quickly remove the mouse from the isoflurane chamber and apply eye lube using a cotton swab to each eye. Further anesthetize the mouse with 1.5%-2% inhaled isoflurane by placing the head of the mouse into the nose cone attached to the isoflurane dispenser and cover the mouse (except the hindpaw designated for operation) with sterile Press’n Seal (Figure 2). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190113/20190113192439_1460.jpgFigure 2. Continuous inhalational anesthesia. The mouse was continuously anesthetized through a nose cone with 1.5%-2% isoflurane.For Steps 5-13 also see Video 1.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Plantar incision surgery. This video shows how the model of postoperative pain is made by making an incision through the plantar skin and flexor digitorum brevis muscle (This video was made at the Medical College of Wisconsin and was performed according to guidelines on Animal Care and approved by the Animal Research Ethics Board of the Medical College of Wisconsin under protocol #0383).",
    "Adhere the hindpaw to the surface by taping the toes down with surgical tape (Figure 3). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190113/20190113192501_5707.jpgFigure 3. Securing the hindpaw to surgical surface. The hindpaw was secured to the surface using surgical tape.Once the hindpaw is secured, apply a cotton swab of 75% ethanol followed by a new cotton swab of betadine. Repeat for a total of 3 applications each. Measure 2 mm from the proximal edge of heel using a digital caliper and place a dot with a permanent marker at this location in the middle of the hindpaw. From the first dot, measure 5 mm towards the toes down the center of the hindpaw and place a second dot (Figure 4). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190113/20190113192519_8890.jpgFigure 4. Measurement of incision. Two dots were placed in the middle of the hindpaw, one 2 mm from the heel and the second 5 mm from the first dot.Check that the mouse is fully anesthetized by lightly pinching the most medial toe (most likely this toe could not be secured by the surgical tape) with the forceps. If the mouse flinches, wait until the mouse no longer reacts to the toe pinch before proceeding to Step 9. Stabilize the hindpaw by placing the forceps on each side of the heel and make a longitudinal incision through the skin and fascia from the first dot to the second dot (Figure 5). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190113/20190113192622_4572.jpgFigure 5. Cutaneous incision. A 5 mm longitudinal incision was made with a No. 11 scalpel. Spread the skin away from the flexor digitorum brevis muscle with the forceps. Elevate the flexor digitorum brevis muscle by inserting one end of the curved forceps underneath the lateral edge of the flexor digitorum brevis muscle and pushing the forceps through to the medial side of the muscle (Figure 6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190113/20190113192640_7015.jpgFigure 6. Elevation of flexor digitorum brevis muscle.",
    "Curved forceps were inserted under the flexor digitorum brevis muscle to elevate the muscle. Make a longitudinal incision with the scalpel through the entire belly of the muscle from the origin and insertion taking care not to sever the muscle completely from the origin and insertion, making sure to cut the belly of the muscle into two halves (Figure 7). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190113/20190113192657_8384.jpgFigure 7. Muscle incision. A longitudinal incision was made through the muscle belly of the elevated flexor digitorum brevis muscle from proximal to distal ends of the cutaneous incision. To suture the wound, remove the curved forceps from underneath the muscle and elevate the edges of the skin surrounding the wound with forceps. Close the wound by putting two sutures in the skin (but not muscle) approximately 2 mm apart using 5-0 nylon sutures and a hemostat (Figure 8).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190113/20190113192717_3590.jpgFigure 8. Cutaneous suturing. The skin was closed with two 5-0 nylon sutures.Apply a generous amount of bacitracin ointment to the wound using a cotton swab and place the mouse in the new cage located on the Heat Therapy Pump pad from Step 2."
