    "1. System Preparation\nDesign of binding-site plasmids \nDesign the binding site cassette as depicted in Figure 1. Each minigene contains the following parts (5' to 3'): Eagl restriction site, ∼40 bases of the 5' end of the kanamycin (Kan) resistance gene, pLac-Ara promoter, ribosome binding site (RBS), AUG of the mCherry gene, a spacer (δ), an RBP binding site, 80 bases of the 5' end of the mCherry gene, and an ApaLI restriction site.\nNOTE: To increase the success rate of the assay, design three binding-site cassettes for each binding site, with spacers consisting of at least one, two, and three bases. See Representative Results section for further guidelines.\nCloning of binding site plasmids\nOrder the binding-site cassettes as double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) minigenes. Each minigene is ∼500 bp long and contains an Eagl restriction site and an ApaLI restriction site at the 5' and 3' ends, respectively (see step 1.1.1).\nNOTE: In this experiment, mini-genes with half of the kanamycin gene were ordered to facilitate screening for positive colonies. However, Gibson assembly17 is also suitable here, in which case the binding site can be ordered as two shorter complementary single-stranded DNA oligos.\nDouble-digest both the mini-genes and the target vector with Eagl-HF and ApaLI by the restriction protocol18, and column purify19.\nLigate the digested minigenes to the binding-site backbone containing the rest of the mCherry reporter gene, terminator, and a kanamycin resistance gene20.\nTransform the ligation solution into Escherichia coli TOP10 cells21.\nIdentify positive transformants via Sanger sequencing.\n\t\t\nDesign a primer 100 bases upstream to the region of interest (see Table 1 for primer sequences).\nMiniprep a few bacterial colonies22.\nPrepare 5 µL of a 5 mM solution of the primer and 10 µL of the DNA at 80 ng/µL concentration.",
    "Send the two solution to a convenient facility for Sanger sequencing23.\nStore purified plasmids at -20 °C, and bacterial strains as glycerol stocks24, both in the 96-well format. DNA will then be used for transformation into E. coli TOP10 cells containing one of four fusion-RBP plasmids (see step 1.3.5).\nDesign and construction of the RBP plasmid\nNOTE: Amino acid and nucleotide sequences of the coat proteins used in this study are listed in Table 2.\n\t\nOrder the required RBP sequence lacking a stop codon as a custom-ordered dsDNA minigene lacking a stop codon with restriction sites at the ends (Figure 1).\nClone the tested RBP lacking a stop codon immediately downstream of an inducible promoter and upstream of a fluorescent protein lacking a start codon (Figure 1), similar to steps 1.2.2-1.2.4. Make sure that the RBP plasmid contains a different antibiotic resistance gene than the binding-site plasmid.\nIdentify positive transformants via Sanger sequencing, similar to step 1.2.5 (see Table 1 for primer sequences).\nChoose one positive transformant and make it chemically-competent25. Store as glycerol purified plasmids at -20 °C and glycerol stocks of bacterial strains24 at -80 °C in 96-well plates.\nTransform the binding-site plasmids (from step 1.2.6) stored in 96-well plates into chemically-competent bacterial cells already containing an RBP-mCerulean plasmid21. To save time, instead of plating the cells on Petri dishes, plate them using an 8-channel pipettor on 8-lane plates containing Luria-Bertani (LB)26 agar with relevant antibiotics (Kan and Amp). Colonies should appear in 16 h.\nSelect a single colony for each double transformant and grow overnight in LB medium with the relevant antibiotics (Kan and Amp) and store as glycerol stocks24 at -80 °C in 96-well plates.\n2. Experiment Setup",
    "NOTE: The protocol presented here was performed using a liquid-handling robotic system in combination with an incubator and a plate reader. Each measurement was carried out for 24 inducer concentrations, with two duplicates for each strain + inducer combination. Using this robotic system, data for 16 strains per day with 24 inducer concentrations was collected. However, if such a device is unavailable, or if fewer experiments are necessary, these can easily be done by hand using an 8-channel multi-pipette and adapting the protocol accordingly. For example, preliminary results for four strains per day with 12 inducer concentrations and four time-points were acquired in this manner.\nPrepare, in advance, 1 L of bioassay buffer (BA) by mixing 0.5 g of tryptone, 0.3 mL of glycerol, 5.8 g of NaCl, 50 mL of 1 M MgSO4, 1 mL of 10x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer pH 7.4, and 950 mL of double distilled water (DDW). Autoclave or sterile filter the BA buffer.\nGrow the double-transformant strains at 37 °C and 250 rpm shaking in 1.5 mL LB with appropriate antibiotics (kanamycin at a final concentration of 25 μg/mL and ampicillin at a final concentration of 100 μg/mL), in 48-well plates, over a period of 18 h (overnight).\nIn the morning, make the following preparations.\nInducer plate. In a clean 96-well plate, prepare wells with semi-poor medium (SPM) consisting of 95% BA and 5% LB26 in the incubator at 37 °C. The number of wells corresponds to the desired number of inducer concentrations. Add C4-HSL to the wells in the inducer plate that will contain the highest inducer concentration (218 nM).",
    "Program the robot to serially dilute medium from each of the highest-concentration wells into 23 lower concentrations ranging from 0 to 218 nM. The volume of each inducer dilution should be sufficient for all strains (including duplicates).\nWhile the inducer dilutions are being prepared, warm 180 μL of SPM in the incubator at 37 °C, in 96-well plates.\nDilute the overnight strains from step 2.2 by a factor of 100 by serial dilutions: first dilute by a factor of 10 by mixing 100 μL of bacteria with 900 μL of SPM in 48-well plates, and then dilute again by a factor of 10 by taking 20 μL from the diluted solution into 180 μL of pre-warmed SPM, in 96-well plates suitable for fluorescent measurements.\nAdd the diluted inducer from the inducer plate to the 96-well plates with the diluted strains according to the final concentrations.\nShake the 96-well plates at 37 °C for 6 h, while taking measurements of optical density at 595 nm (OD595), mCherry (560 nm/612 nm) and mCerulean (460 nm/510 nm) fluorescence via a plate reader every 30 min. For normalization purposes, measure growth of SMP with no cells added.\n3. Preliminary Results Analysis\nFor each day of experiment, choose a time interval of logarithmic growth according to the measured growth curves, between the linear growth phase and the stationary (T­0, Tfinal). Take approximately 6−8 time points, while discarding the first and last measurements to avoid error derived from inaccuracy of exponential growth detection (see Figure 2A, top panel).\nNOTE: Discard strains that show abnormal growth curves or strains where logarithmic growth phase could not be detected and repeat the experiment.",
    "Calculate the average normalized fluorescence of mCerulean and rate of production of mCherry, from the raw data of both mCerulean and mCherry fluorescence for each inducer concentration (Figure 2A).\nCalculate normalized mCerulean as follows:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59611/59611eq1.jpg\n\t\t​where blank(mCerulean) is the mCerulean level [a.u.] for medium only, blank(OD) is the optical density for medium only, and mCerulean and OD are the mCerulean fluorescence and optical density values, respectively.\nAverage mCerulean over the different time points (Figure 2B, top two panels) as follows:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59611/59611eq2.jpg\n\t\t​where #Time points is the number of data timepoints taken into account, T0 is the time at which the exponential growth phase begins, and Tfinal is the time at which the exponential growth phase ends.\nCalculate mCherry rate of production (Figure 2B, bottom two panels) as follows:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59611/59611eq3.jpg\n\t\twhere mCherry(t) is the mCherry level [a.u.] at time t, OD is the optical density value, T0 is the time at which the exponential growth phase begins, and Tfinal is the time at which the exponential growth phase ends.\nFinally, plot the mCherry rate of production as a function of mCerulean, creating dose response curves as a function of RBP-mCerulean fusion fluorescence (Figure 2C). Such plots represent production of the reporter gene as a function of RBP presence in the cell.\n4. Dose Response Function Fitting Routine and KRBP Extraction\nUnder the assumption that the ribosome rate of translation with the RBP bound is constant, model the mCherry production rate as follows (see Figure 2D, green line):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59611/59611eq4.jpg",
    "where [x] is the normalized average mCerulean fluorescence calculated according to Eq. 2, mCherry production rate is the value calculated according to Eq. 3, KRBP is the relative binding affinity [a.u.], Kunbound is the ribosome rate of translation with the RBP unbound, n is the cooperativity factor, and C is the base fluorescence [a.u.]. C, n, Kunbound, and KRBP are found by fitting the mCherry production rate data to the model (Eq. 4).\nUsing data analysis software, conduct a fitting procedure on plots depicting mCherry production rate as a function of averaged mCerulean (step 3.3), and extract the fit parameters according to the formula in Eq. 4.\nNOTE: Only fitting results with R2 > 0.6 are taken into account. For those fits, KRBP error is mostly in the range of 0.5% to 20% of KRBP values, for a 0.67 confidence interval, while those with higher KRBP error can be also verified by eye.\nNormalize KRBP values by the respective maximal value of averaged mCerulean for each dose-response function.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59611/59611eq5.jpg\n\twhere KRBP in [a.u.] is the value extracted from the fitting procedure in Eq. 4, and max (averaged mCerulean) is the maximal averaged mCerulean signal [a.u] observed for the current strain.\nNOTE: The normalization facilitates correct comparison of the regulatory effect across strains by eliminating the dependence on the particular maximal RBP expression levels.\nSubscription Required.
