    "The study has been approved by the appropriate institutional research ethics committee and performed following the ethical standards as laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of HMC (no. 16260/16) and QBRI (no. 2016-003). This work is also optimized for hESCs such as H1 and H9. Blood samples were obtained from healthy individuals with full informed consent. The iPSCs are generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy individuals.\n1. Culturing and maintaining iPSCs\nPrepare basement membrane matrix-coated plates by reconstituting coating matrix in knockout-DMEM at a ratio of 1:80 and store at 4 °C.\nPrepare iPSCs culture media by adding 50 mL of 10x stem cell supplement media to 500 mL of stem cell basal media, along with 5 mL of 100x penicillin-streptomycin (P/S) and store at 4 °C for short term or at -20 °C for long term use.\nLine the plates with coating matrix-1 mL for a 6-well plate, 500 µL for a 12-well plate, 250 µL for a 24-well plate-and incubate the plate at 37 °C for 1-2 h.\nRemove an aliquot of iPSCs culture media and pre-warm at room temperature before use.\nThaw a vial of iPSCs (ESCs or iPSCs) in a 37 °C water bath and transfer to a 15 mL conical tube containing 2-3 mL of culture media.\nCentrifuge the tube at 120 x g for 4 min at room temperature (RT-23 °C).\nRemove the supernatant and add 2 mL of fresh culture media supplemented with 10 µM ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632). Plate the cells in one well of a matrix-coated 6-well plate and place the plate at 37 °C.\nAfter 24 h, remove the media and replace it with fresh culture media.",
    "Change the media every day until the cells reach 80%-90% confluency.\nUpon reaching confluency, passage cells by following the steps outlined below.\n\t\nRemove the media and wash the cells with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS).\nAdd iPSCs dissociation reagent (see Table of Materials)-500 µL for a well of a 6-well plate, 250 µL for a well of a 24-well plate-and incubate for 1 min at 37 °C.\nRemove the dissociation reagent and incubate the cells dry for 1 min at 37 °C.\nCollect the cells using culture media-1 mL for a well of a 6-well plate and 250 µL for a well of a 24-well plate-in a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 120 x g for 4 min.\nResuspend cells in culture media-2 mL for a well of a 6-well plate and 500 µL for a well of a 24-well plate-supplemented with 10 µM ROCK inhibitor and plate them on fresh matrix coated plates at 40% confluency.\n2. Differentiation of iPSC into MSCs\nPrepare MSC differentiation media by adding 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% P/S to low glucose DMEM + pyruvate and store at 4 °C.\nUpon reaching 80% confluency, use iPSCs for embryoid body (EB) formation following the steps outlined below.\n\t\nWash the cells with DPBS and incubate them with dissociation medium/EDTA-500 µL for a well of a 6-well plate, 250 µL for a well of a 24-well plate.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 1 min, aspirate the dissociation reagent and keep the cells at 37 °C for an additional 1 min. To start MSC differentiation, ~10-12 x 106 cells are required.",
    "Collect the cells in a 15 mL conical tube using culture media. Make sure to be very gentle while collecting to prevent cells from getting single and allow EB formation. Centrifuge the cells at 120 x g for 4 min.\nResuspend the cells in 3 mL of MSC differentiation media containing 10 µM ROCK inhibitor.\nMix and distribute 0.5 mL/well in a 24-well ultra-low attachment plate.\n\t\tNOTE: Usage of ultra-low attachment plate would encourage cell aggregation into EBs rather than their attachment on the surface.\nPlace the plate in the incubator at 37 °C.\nAfter 24 h, induce the attained EBs with high retinoic acid (RA) treatment by following the steps outlined below.\n\t\nAdd 10 µM RA to 3 mL of MSC differentiation media. Collect EBs in a 15 mL tube and allow them to settle down for 15 min.\nRemove the supernatant from EBs and add MSC differentiation media supplemented with 10 µM RA.\nResuspend gently and distribute 0.5 mL/well in the same 24-well ultra-low attachment plate.\nPlace the plate in the incubator at 37 °C. Do not disturb EBs for the next 48 h.\nAfter 48 h, collect EBs in a 15 mL tube and allow them to settle down for 15 min.\nRemove the supernatant from EBs and add MSC differentiation media supplemented with 0.1 µM RA.\nResuspend gently and distribute 0.5 mL/well in the same 24-well ultra-low attachment plate.\nPlace the plate in the incubator at 37 °C. Do not disturb EBs for the next 48 h.\nRemove the RA added to the cells by following the steps outlined below.\n\t\nAfter 48 h of the last RA treatment, collect the EBs and allow them to settle down for 15 min.\nRemove the supernatant and add DMEM low glucose media without cytokines.",
    "Resuspend gently and distribute 0.5 mL/well in a 24-well ultra-low attachment plate. Place the plate in the incubator at 37 °C.\nPlate the iPSCs-derived EBs by following the steps outlined below.\n\t\nAfter 48 h from the previous step (step 2.4), collect the EBs in a 15 mL tube and allow them to settle down for 15 min.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend in 2 mL of fresh MSC differentiation media.\nTransfer to two wells of a basement membrane matrix-coated 6-well plate.\nChange the media every other day for additional 5 days.\nAfter 5 days, remove the spent media and replace it with fresh MSC differentiation media containing 2.5 ng/mL of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF).\nPassage the plated EBs when they reach 80%-90% confluency, by following the steps outlined below.\n\t\nWash the cells with DPBS, add trypsin-EDTA-500 µL for a well of a 6-well plate-and incubate the cells at 37 °C for 3 min.\nCollect the cells using MSC differentiation media in a 15 mL conical tube and spin at 750 x g for 4 min.\nResuspend in MSC differentiation media with 2.5 ng/mL of bFGF and plate the cells on basement membrane matrix-coated plates at a ratio of 1:3.\nRepeat the passage when the cells reach 70%-80% confluency. It is expected to gain 3-6 million cells by 2-3 passages.\n3. Flow cytometry analysis of iPSCs-derived MSCs\nNOTE: Upon undergoing 2-3 passages, the cells should be accessed for the efficiency of MSC differentiation. Differentiation will be considered successful if the cells express MSC differentiation markers-CD44, CD73, CD90, and CD105 at more than 90% efficiency, and do not express high levels of hematopoietic markers-CD14, CD19, CD34, and CD45. The efficiency of these markers can be accessed by following the steps below.",
    "Passage the cells using the steps outlined above (step 2.6) and attain 1 x 105 cells in one well of a v-bottom 96-well plate.\nCentrifuge the plate at 375 x g for 4 min at 4 °C.\nResuspend 1 x 105 cells in 100 µL of cold DPBS with 1 µL of conjugated antibody (Ab) (see Table of Materials) and incubate at 4 °C for 30-40 min preventing exposure to light.\nResuspend another 1 x 105 cells in 100 µL of cold DPBS with the respective isotype control of the conjugated Ab at a concentration of 1:100 ) and incubate at 4 °C for 30-40 min preventing exposure to light.\nFollowing incubation, centrifuge the plate at 375 x g for 4 min at 4 °C.

Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in 200 µL of cold DPBS and collect in dark, cold 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and keep them on ice until analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).\nFor FACS analysis, distribute the cells using side scattered (SSC-A) versus forward scattered (FSC-A) to exclude the debris. Further, distribute the gated cells using forward scattered height (FSC-H) versus forward scattered area (FSC-A) to distinguish singlets from doublets from the live cell population.\n\tNOTE: Cells were gated relative to the shift of isotype control for every marker, and a minimum of 10,000 gated events from every stained sample was used for analysis.\n4. Differentiation of MSCs into adipocytes\nPrepare adipocyte differentiation basal media by adding 10% knockout serum replacement (KOSR), 1% Glutamine, 1% P/S, 4.5 ng/µL of glucose to minimum essential media (MEM)-alpha and store at 4 °C.",
    "Allow MSCs to reach above 90% confluency. Continue culturing them for another 48 h to allow them to undergo a period of growth arrest.\nPrepare complete adipocyte differentiation media by adding 100 µg/mL of 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), 1 µM of dexamethasone, 0.2 U/mL of insulin, 100 µM of indomethacin, and 10 µM of rosiglitazone to the basal media.\nRemove MSC differentiation media and wash the cells using DPBS.\nAdd complete adipocyte differentiation media-2 mL for a well of a 6-well plate and 1 mL for a well of a 12-well plate-and incubate the cells at 37 °C.

    "Dilute the primary antibodies against FABP4, adiponectin in 2%-3% BSA, at a concentration of 1:500 (see Table of Materials). Add these antibodies together only if raised in different animals and place the plate on the shaker at 4 °C, overnight.\nRemove the primary antibodies and wash the cells three times with TBST (15 min each) and place it on a shaker at room temperature.\nPrepare Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies in PBST (1:500). Incubate the cells in the secondary antibody combinations (as per the species in which the primary antibody is raised ) for 60 min at room temperature and cover the plate with aluminum foil to protect it from light.\nDiscard the secondary antibodies, wash with TBST three times, and place the plate on the shaker.\nTo stain the nuclei, add 1 µg/mL of Hoechst 33342-200 µL for a well of a 24-well plate-diluted in PBS and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.\nDiscard the Hoechst solution and add PBS-500 µL for a well of a 24-well plate-to the cells. Keep the plates covered from light until visualized using an inverted fluorescence microscope.\n6.
