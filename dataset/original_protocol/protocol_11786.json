    "Maintenance of laboratory mice and all animal experiments were done in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations for the care and use of laboratory animals in University of Turku.\n1. Preparation of seminiferous tubules for microdissection\nSacrifice an adult male mouse (≥8 weeks old, testis 80–120 mg depending on the strain and age) via CO2 asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation.\n\tNOTE: The mouse should be sexually mature, and preferably at least 8 weeks old. Transillumination pattern of juvenile mice differs from adult because the wave of the seminiferous epithelium has not yet been fully established, and the timing of the first wave of spermatogenesis is distinct21,22. Lack of elongating spermatids in <4-week-old male mice precludes their use for transillumination-assisted microdissection. All mouse strains that have normal spermatogenesis can be used.\nSpray the ventral abdomen with 70% ethanol. Open the abdominopelvic cavity using sterile scissors, making a V-shaped opening.\nPulling on the epididymal fat pad with sterile forceps, locate the testes, dissect them using scissors and place them on a sterile 100-mm Petri dish containing PBS.\n\tNOTE: To maintain sterility, make sure all labware and surgical tools are sterile.\nUsing fine-tipped scissors decapsulate the testes by cutting a slit in the tunica albuginea, the thick fibrous sheet encapsulating the testis. Then tear the tunica open using a pair of forceps. Force the tubules out by pressing with forceps and discard the tunica.\n\tNOTE: While discarding the tunica, it might be beneficial for some downstream applications that arteria testicularis is removed together with the tunica. Avoid damaging the seminiferous tubules.\nMove the seminiferous tubules to a new Petri dish and pour enough sterile PBS to cover the bottom of the Petri dish. Next, gently pull the tubules apart but avoid damaging the tubules.",
    "NOTE: Too much mechanical stress will impinge on the transillumination pattern and affect the viability of the tissue and its cellular architecture. The tubules can also be processed for whole-mount immunostainings from this point without staging (3B). Sometimes it is sufficient to define the stage retrospectively by including antibodies against proteins expressed in differentiating spermatogonia, such as SALL4, c-KIT and DNMT3A18,23. The density of spermatogonia is a relatively reliable stage indicator (Figure 2).\n2. Transillumination-assisted microdissection\nPlace the Petri dish under a dissection microscope firmly by taping it to the stage.\n\tNOTE: It is important to tape the Petri dish well to prevent its movement which could cause mixing of the collected staged seminiferous tubule segments.\nTo reveal the light absorption pattern of seminiferous tubules under focus, make sure that the sample is illuminated from below and the light passes through the sample, i.e., it is transilluminated.\n\tNOTE: The amount of light absorbed/scattered is relative to the level of chromatin condensation in elongating spermatids and their bundling inside the seminiferous tubule: the more condensed, the more light is absorbed, i.e., appears darker.\nGet acquainted with the light absorption pattern of different stages as described in Figure 2, Figure 5A and Figure S1 by carefully moving bundles of tubules using fine forceps.\n\tNOTE: The stages always follow each other in a logical order, forming the wave of seminiferous epithelium. However, it is important to know that the direction of the spermatogenic wave occasionally reverses and then reverts back again (also known as modulations4,9), sometimes complicating the procedure. Also, the length of each stage, in terms of how many mm of tubule, varies considerably.",
    "Carefully lift the tubule of interest using forceps with a hooked tip, and then cut a segment of appropriate length using microdissection scissors (see Supplementary Video 1). A hook at the tip of the forceps makes lifting and holding a tubule easier and helps to avoid squeezing it.\n\tNOTE: The length of the segments to be cut depends on downstream applications. For the collection of pooled tubule pieces of a specific stage for protein or RNA analysis12,13 (II–V, VII–VIII and IX–XI, Figure 5B) the length is typically 2–5 mm. When standard phenol-chloroform extraction is used, around 200 ng of RNA can be derived from 1 mm of tubule. For whole-mount staining of staged tubule segments, the length of the segments should be >5 mm. For squash preparations the length of segments should not exceed 1–2 mm because the cells in the middle of the segment may fail to exit if too long. Use a mm scale under the Petri dish for an accurate measurement of the tubule length.\n3. Immunostaining of different preparations\nSquash preparation: stage verification and immunostaining\n\tNOTE: Stage-specific tubule pieces can be squashed on a microscope slide with a cover glass to perform morphological analysis of living cells by phase-contrast microscopy and subsequent immunostaining. A beginner is recommended to use this approach to verify the stages when getting acquainted with the transillumination-assisted microdissection method.\n\t\nCollect the segment in a volume of 10 μL using a pipette and move it onto a microscope slide.",
    "Squash the tubule by placing a cover glass (20 mm x 20 mm) carefully on the tubule. As a result, cells will flow out the tubule and form a live-cell monolayer. Place a filter paper on the edge of the cover glass to facilitate the spreading of cells. Avoid squashing the cells too much to keep them alive.\nMonitor cell spreading under a microscope. Use a phase-contrast microscope at 40x objective to verify stage recognition by examining the cell types present (Figure 2, Figure S2).\nOnce the cells have spread to form a round monolayer from both ends of the tubule, dip the slide into a container containing liquid nitrogen while holding it with forceps. Keep it submerged for 10 s. Alternatively place the slide on a dry ice plate for freezing.\nRemove the cover glass by flipping it off using a scalpel.\nWithout a delay, proceed with the fixation and quickly place the slide in a container with 90% ethanol for 2–5 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure the squash preparation does not thaw before placing it to 90% ethanol. Other fixatives can also be used, such as acetone, for 10 min.\nAir-dry and store at room temperature (RT) (up to some days) or at -80 °C (long-term).\nFor immunostaining, post-fix the samples in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min at RT.\nRinse in PBS and permeabilize with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min.\nRinse in PBS and draw a grease ring around each squash sample.\nAdd 50–100 μL of 10% BSA (bovine serum albumin) in 0.1% Tween in PBS (PBST) inside the grease ring and block samples for 30 min at RT.\nRemove the BSA solution and incubate with a primary antibody diluted in 10% BSA in PBST for 1 h at RT.",
    "Wash 3x for 5 min with PBST.\nIncubate with a secondary antibody diluted in 10% BSA in PBST.\n\t\tNOTE: To stain the acrosomes, the samples can be incubated with Rhodamine-labeled Peanut agglutinin antibody (PNA, 1:1000) in 10% BSA in PBST for 1 h at RT (Figure S3) instead of specific primary and secondary antibodies.\nWash 3x for 5 min each with PBST, rinse with PBS and mount with a mountant containing DAPI.\nWhole-mount immunostaining of seminiferous tubules\n\tNOTE: The protocol below describes whole-mount staining for staged (from step 2.4) tubule segments. If a researcher wants to perform whole-mount staining without staging (from step 1.5), pay attention to notes in 3.2.1 and 3.2.7.\n\t\nUsing a pipette, transfer the tubule segments (from step 2.4) in ice-cold PBS into a 15 mL conical tube and allow them to sediment on ice.\n\t\tNOTE: If using unstaged tubules from 1.5., separate the tubules in a Petri dish by pipetting up and back onto a tilted dish several times. Use a 1-mL pipette with a cut tip. This step is intended to open up the structure of the tissue. However, avoid too much pipetting as it might damage the tubules. Sedimentation of tubules will take some tens of seconds. Small tubule fragments, interstitial cells and cell debris stay in the supernatant.\nCarefully remove the supernatant (SN) by pipetting or with an aspirator. Add 10 mL of ice-cold PBS and mix by inversion.\nAllow to sediment and then remove SN as before.\nAdd 5 mL of 4% PFA and fix for 5 h on a rotating table (20–30 rpm) at +4 °C.",
    "NOTE: Fixation time depends on the proteins of interest and their subcellular localization. For nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, a 2 h fixation is typically sufficient, however, membrane markers, such as GFRα1 (GDNF family receptor alpha 1; Figure 6A,B), benefit from a longer fixation, up to 6 h.\nAllow to sediment, remove SN (PFA) as before, and rinse briefly by adding 10 mL of PBS and inverting the tube.\nAllow to sediment, remove SN as before, and repeat the PBS washing step three times for at least 10 min each on a rotating table at +4 °C and proceed with staining or store at +4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: If the working conditions are sterile and clean the samples can be stored and used for at least some weeks. Alternatively, add Sodium Azide to a final concentration of 0.02% (w/v) from a 2% stock solution to help preserve the tubules prior to storing at +4 °C.\nUsing a 1-mL pipette, move 10–20 fixed tubule segments to a 2-mL round-bottom tube. Allow to sediment and remove SN.\n\t\tNOTE: If working with long tubules that have not been staged, pour the tubules onto a Petri dish and using microdissection scissors and forceps cut segments of around 5–20 mm. Too long segments will tangle during the staining procedure, whereas too short segments are easily lost.\nAdd 1 mL of 2% BSA + 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum) in 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBSX). Block for at least 1 h on a rotating table (20–30 rpm) at RT.\nRinse with 1 mL of PBSX, remove SN by pipetting and add 250 μL of primary antibody diluted in 1% BSA in PBSX (1:100–1:2000 dilution). Incubate for 2 h at RT or overnight at +4 °C on a rotating table (20–30 rpm).",
    "Remove the antibody solution by pipetting and rinse the tubules with 1 mL of PBSX as above. Wash three times for 1 h in PBSX on a rotating table (20–30 rpm) at RT.\n\t\tNOTE: After this first wash the sample can be left overnight at +4 °C if necessary.\nRemove SN and add 250 μL of secondary antibody diluted in 1% BSA in PBSX (typically 1:500 dilution of a fluorescent-labeled antibody). Cover in foil and incubate on a rotating table (20–30 rpm) at RT for 1 h.\nRepeat 3.2.10.\nFinally remove SN and pour the tubules to a microscope slide. Gently separate and arrange tubules in linear strips using gel-loading tips. Drain off excess buffer and add mounting medium and a coverslip.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid drying of the tubules while arranging them. Counter-staining of the nuclei with DAPI is not necessary in most cases. Seal off the edge of the coverslip with nail polish to prevent sample drying and deterioration. Slides can be stored for 1–2 weeks at +4 °C before imaging."
