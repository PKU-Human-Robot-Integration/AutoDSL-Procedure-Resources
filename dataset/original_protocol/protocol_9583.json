    "All experiments were performed in compliance with the guidelines of the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care (NIH Publication No. 80-23, revised 1996) and under the approval and supervision of the Academy of Experimental Animal Centre of the Institute of Medicinal Plant Development (China).\n1. Animal husbandry\nHouse female and male mice at 25 °C for 12 h light/12 h dark cycles.\nProvide free access to water and a standard pelleted diet.\nAllow mice to acclimate to their environment for 7 days prior to the operation if transported from a different facility.\n2. Ovariectomy in female mice\nAnesthetize the female (8 weeks postnatal, not less than 6-weeks-old) with isoflurane (~4−5% for induction, ~1−2% for maintenance) in 100% oxygen via a face cone mask.\nCheck that the appropriate depth of aesthesia has been achieved by making sure that there are no voluntary movements for over 30 s, in combination with an appropriate respiratory rate (e.g., 1 breath per 2 s or longer). Alternatively, test the mouse's response to gentle pressure on the toes of the hind paws.\n\tNOTE: The normal respiratory rate is ~180/min. A rate drop of 50% is acceptable during anesthesia17.\n\t\nUse ophthalmic ointment to prevent corneal drying and eye trauma while under anesthesia.\nKeep the body temperature of the mouse at or above 36 °C. Provide supplemental heat support during the period of anesthesia when necessary.\nSterilize and disinfect all surgical instruments and hard surfaces of the operating table with 75% ethanol prior to use.\nPlace animal on a sterile drape.\nShave fur bilaterally over the lumbar spine on the back of the mouse to expose the skin.\nSterilize the exposed skin with 75% ethanol.",
    "Make a single midline incision (about 0.5 cm in length) on the back from the center of the two thigh roots toward the head of ~1 cm distance (position is shown in Figure 1).\nUse small scissors to penetrate the skin to gently free subcutaneous tissue from the underlying muscle in order to expose the muscle layer.\nLocate the ovary under the thin muscle layer and make a small incision (about 5 mm in length) to gain entry to the peritoneal cavity.\n\t\nUse small tweezers to pull the tissue slightly on the left side of the abdominal cavity to show the left-hand ovary wrapping around the white adipose tissue (a translucent, irregular mass as seen by the naked eye, see Figure 1).\nRetract the ovarian fat pad surrounding the ovary with blunt forceps to expose the oviduct.\nPerform a single ligature around the oviduct to prevent bleeding.\nUse small scissors to sever the oviduct gently and remove the ovary.\nCheck the oviduct carefully to confirm that all ovarian tissues are removed. The ovary is about 5 mm × 4 mm × 3 mm with irregular nodules on the surface.\nPlace the remaining part of the oviduct back into the abdominal cavity.\nSuture the muscle layer with absorbable sutures.\nPull the skin to the right side to expose the muscle layer on the right-hand side and remove the right ovary by repeating steps 2.9–2.16.\nClose the skin incision by using absorbable sutures.\n\t\nInject each mouse intraperitoneally with penicillin sodium (10,000 units/10 g per mouse) to prevent infection.",
    "Inject lidocaine (4 mg/kg, 0.4 mL/kg of a 1% solution) beneath the skin along the site of the incision. Also provide ibuprofen (50–60 mg/kg/day; 10 mL of Children's Motrin in 500 mL of water) continuously in the drinking water for 3 days for pain treatment.\nPlace each mouse into a sterilized cage individually.\nKeep under close observation for approximately 1–2 h until fully recovered from anesthesia.\n\t\nRecover animals on paper towels in a clean cage without bedding. This step minimizes the risk of tracheal obstruction or pneumonia. Provide supplemental heat support during anesthetic recovery. Monitor the surgical site to prevent the rupture of the wound.\nFollowing the recovery period (approximately 24 h after surgery), place mice back to their home cage.\nDo not perform the experiment for at least 2 weeks after surgery.\n3. Hormone-induced estrus in females\nDetermine the estrous stage of the females by performing a vaginal smear as described in McLean et al.18. No estrus cycle change indicates that the ovariectomy of the female was successful.\nInject estradiol benzoate (20 μg per mouse, dissolved in 0.1 mL of sterilized olive oil, intraperitoneally) 48 h prior to the sexual behavior test.\nInject progesterone (500 μg per mouse, dissolved in 0.1 mL of oil, intraperitoneally) 4 h prior to the sexual behavior test.\n\tNOTE: The eligibility of an estrus female is determined by the female accepting genital insertion of a male mouse 3 or more times, when they cohabit with a sexually active and experienced male in one cage.\n4. Preparation for the sexual behavior test\nConduct the sexual behavior test of male mice in a rectangular and open field box (40 cm x 40 cm x 40 cm) with black Plexiglass walls, except for a transparent front wall that allows for the observation of mouse movement.",
    "Set the general room lighting to 650 lux.\n\tNOTE: The mice should not be illuminated directly to avoid abnormal behavior patterns.\nUse a digital camera linked to a computer to videotape the movement and behavior of the mice.\nPerform the behavioral test on the male mice during the first hours of the dark cycle.\n5. Habituation\nKeep the experiment room quiet.\nPlace the mice to be tested in the center of the open field box, allowing them to explore the environment freely for 30 min.\nHabituate mice for 2 consecutive days prior to the testing day in the apparatus to prevent stress from the new environment.\n\tNOTE: Mice should move and explore freely without feeling stress. Both male and female mice need to be habituated to the testing environment.\n6. Behavioral assays\nTurn on the camera prior to the beginning of the test.\nPlace the mouse to be tested in the center of the open field in the test box, allowing free exploration for 5 min to acclimate to the environment.\nPlace a female in estrus into the test box.\nRecord the social and mating behaviors and the interactions between the male and female mice for 30 min.\nTurn off the camera and confirm that the video is saved.\nTake the female out of the test box and record the formation of a vaginal plug.\n\tNOTE: A female mouse that accepted mating cannot be employed in another sexual behavior test in one day.\nPlace the female back to its home cage.\nReturn the male to its home cage.\nClean the urine, feces, and padding within the apparatus.\nRemove the smell of the tested mice with 75% ethanol.\nStart the test of the next male mouse by repeating steps 6.1–6.10.\n7. Behavioral data extraction",
    "Play back the video recording and extract the behavioral parameters (see Figure 2).\n\t\nRecord the number of mounts in 30 min.\nRecord the number of intromissions in 30 min. Count a pelvic thrust as an intromission.\nRecord the time from the introduction of the female to the first mounting as mounting latency.\nRecord the time from the introduction of the female to the first intromission as intromission latency.\nRecord the time from first intromission to the first ejaculation as ejaculation latency.\nRecord the time from ejaculation to the next mounting as post-ejaculatory mount latency.\nRecord number of copulatory series in 30 min. A copulatory series is each sequence from mounting to ejaculation.\nRecord the time of all copulatory series in 30 min as the duration of the copulatory series.\nSubscription Required.
