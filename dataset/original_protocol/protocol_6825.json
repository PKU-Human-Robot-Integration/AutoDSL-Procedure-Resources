    "Saccharomyces cerevisiae cultureStreak S. cerevisiae from glycerol stocks onto fresh YPD agar plates (2% agar) and incubate the plates at 30°C for 2–3 days. Plates usually last ~2 weeks.Prepare 2 × 200 ml YPD media in 500 ml baffled flasks and 12 × 1.5 L YPD media in 2.8 L baffled flasks.Pick a single colony from the plate and inoculate 2 ml YPD media in a culture tube. Incubate cultures with 200 rpm shaking at 30°C for ~8 h. This is usually performed early in the morning of the day before the large-scale culture.At the end of the day, inoculate 2 × 200 ml YPD media in 500 ml baffled flasks with 1 ml pre-culture started in the morning, and incubate with 200 rpm shaking overnight at 30°C. Cultures should reach OD600 of 10–12.The next morning, add an aliquot (30 ml) of the overnight pre-culture to each of 12 flasks containing 1.5 L YPD media, resulting in an initial OD600 of 0.2–0.3. Incubate the cultures with 200 rpm shaking at 30°C until the OD600 reaches 0.8–1.2; typically, this takes ~6 h from inoculation.Harvest cells by centrifugation at 5,000 × g, 8°C for 25 min.Wash the pellets once with 10 mM EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) (~30 ml per 20 g cell paste).Determine the wet cell weight and store pellets in a -80°C freezer until use. Typically, 50–60 g wet cell paste is obtained.GS preparationMembrane fraction preparationThaw the frozen cell pellets on ice.Resuspend the cell pellets in 150 ml ice-cold breaking buffer.Transfer the suspension to the bead beater chamber with ~150 ml ice-cold, clean 0.5 mm glass beads. Top up the chamber with buffer to minimize the available air space once the chamber is assembled, and ensure that the chamber is well covered by the ice-water.",
    "Lyse cells by bead beating with 5 × 1 min pulses, with a 10-min rest between each pulse.Centrifuge at 1,500 × g for 15 min at 4°C to clear the lysate; separate the clarified lysate.Resuspend the insoluble material in breaking buffer (100 ml) and repeat Steps B1c and B1d to ensure breaking > 95% of cells.Combine the clarified lysates from the two bead beating cycles and transfer to 70-ml ultracentrifuge tubes.Centrifuge the lysate at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. A brown pellet should be visible at the bottom of the tubes. This pellet consists mostly of membrane proteins, lipids, and any other molecules such as glycans tightly associated with them.Resuspend the pellets in ~80 ml membrane buffer using a 7-ml Dounce homogenizer and the loose pestle (labeled by the manufacturer as “A”) for ~10 strokes, or until no more large pellet chunks remain, and then the tight pestle (labeled by the manufacturer as “B”) for an additional ~10 strokes to ensure thorough resuspension of the membrane pellet.Determine the protein concentration using the 660 nm Assay Kit and BSA standards according to the manufacturer’s protocol. To ensure appropriate reading, the resuspended membrane fraction is typically diluted 50–200-fold.Adjust the final volume of the resuspended membrane fractions with membrane buffer to a final concentration of ~5 mg/ml protein. Typically, an 18 L culture yields ~100 ml resuspended membrane fraction.Flash-freeze 20 ml aliquots in 50 ml Falcon tubes in liquid nitrogen, and store in a -80°C freezer until ready to proceed to the next step (Figure 2, lane 1).Note: We call this resuspension a “membrane fraction,” which can be stored with minimal loss of activity if freeze–thawing is minimized.",
    "Detergent solubilizationThaw aliquots of the membrane fraction on ice and transfer to an appropriately sized, chilled Erlenmeyer flask containing a stir bar and place in an ice-water bath. Due to the ability to store the purified GS, we suggest using the entire prepared membrane fraction to obtain a 2.5-ml batch of purified GS.While stirring the thawed membrane fractions, add GTPγS (27.5 μM final concentration), DTT (6.88 mM), and NaCl (192 mM).Add a 10% (w/v) CHAPS/2% (w/v) CHS solution dropwise to achieve final concentrations of 0.688% CHAPS and 0.138% CHS.Allow the suspension to stir for 30 min in an ice-water bath using a stir bar and stir plate. It is important to mix the solution gently to prevent inactivation of GS; thus, set the stirring such that the surface of the solution forms a small vortex without any bubbles. This step can also be performed using a rotator.Transfer the solution to 70-ml centrifuge tubes and balance.Centrifuge at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C.Retain the supernatant as the “detergent-solubilized fraction” (Figure 2, lane 2). If this solution is not immediately used for the product entrapment purification, it can be flash-frozen and stored at -80°C with minimal loss of activity.Product entrapment purification (see Figure 1 for a flow chart of the procedure)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3995/bioprotoc-11-08-3995-g001.jpgFigure 1. Flow chart of the product entrapment purification of GS. Steps in the protocol and the corresponding SDS-PAGE lanes in Figure 2 are described in parentheses. Key fractions containing GS are bolded.Add a 0.125× volume of KF mix and UDP-Glc (4 mM final concentration) to the detergent-solubilized fraction. Incubate at 30°C for 20–30 min. Periodically invert the tube to ensure sufficient mixing.Chill the reaction on ice for 15 min. Insoluble glucan should become visible in the solution.",
    "Collect the insoluble glucan and bound proteins by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C (see Figure 3 for an image of the pellet). Save an aliquot of the supernatant (product entrapment unbound fraction; Figure 2, lane 3) for protein concentration determination (Step B3o) and SDS-PAGE analysis (Step B3p).Wash the resulting glucan/protein pellet by resuspension in 1.5 ml wash buffer and homogenization using the 7-ml homogenizer and the tight pestle “B”.Collect the glucan/protein pellet by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Save the supernatant for later characterization.Repeat Steps B3d and B3e three more times.Resuspend the pellet in 1.5 ml wash buffer as described in Step B3d, transfer the resuspension to a 3.5-ml ultracentrifuge tube, and collect the pellet by ultracentrifugation at 400,000 × g, 4°C for 10 min. Combine the supernatant from Steps B3e and B3g and store as the “product entrapment pellet wash fraction” (Figure 2, lane 4) for later characterization.Release GS from the insoluble glucan by resuspending the pellet in 0.5 ml extraction buffer, followed by homogenization for ~10 s using the hand-held electronic homogenizer (BioVortexer).Incubate the resuspension overnight at 4°C.Centrifuge the resuspension at 400,000 × g, 4 °C for 10 min and separate the supernatant and pellet.Resuspend the pellet from Step B3j in 0.5 ml extraction buffer, followed by homogenization for ~10 s using the hand-held electronic homogenizer.Incubate the suspension for 10 min on ice, centrifuge the resuspension at 400,000 × g (100,000 rpm using the TLA100.3 rotor), 4°C for 10 min, and separate the supernatant and pellet.Repeat Steps B3k and B3l three more times.Combine the supernatants from Steps B3j and B3l to obtain ~2.5 ml “product entrapment purified GS” (Figure 2, lane 6).Resuspend the pellet in 0.",
    "5 ml extraction buffer as described in Step B3k, and adjust the volume to 1.0 ml with extraction buffer to obtain the “product entrapment residual glucan bound fraction” (Figure 2, lane 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3995/bioprotoc-11-08-3995-g002.jpgFigure 2.

Image of a glucan pellet formed after product entrapment Step B3c. The pellet was prepared from 30–40 ml product entrapment reaction (Step B3a) in a 50-ml centrifuge tube.Determine the protein concentration at each step of the purification using the EZQ Assay Kit and BSA as the standard. Typically, this protocol yields 0.73 ± 0.12 mg GS from 18 L yeast culture. Knowledge of the protein concentration is critical to performing the GS activity assay and determining the specific activity of GS.Analyze 1–10 µg protein from each purification step using SDS-PAGE with a 4–20% stain-free gel (Bio-Rad). Determine the purity of GS according to densitometry of the Fks1p band relative to the other bands (see Figure 2A). We typically obtain GS at 20–30% purity. Western blotting can also be used to ensure the copurification of Fks1p and Rho1p, two known components of GS.Flash-freeze and store aliquots of the purified GS at -80°C.",
    "Typical enzyme activity assaysPrepare stock and working solutions of UDP-[14C]GlcTo prepare a stock solution of radioactive UDP-Glc, dilute 500 µl UDP-[14C]Glc in 70% EtOH to a total volume of 3.5 ml with diH2O by washing the vial with at least 3 × 500 µl volumes of diH2O. Divide the solution into 4 tubes and freeze at -20°C. Once frozen, lyophilize the tubes overnight to dryness. Prepare a 50 mM solution of non-radioactive UDP-Glc and add 3 µmol (60 µl) to each tube, resulting in UDP-Glc solutions of ~10,000 cpm/nmol. Typically, we prepare a stock solution with high radioactivity and dilute based on the purpose of the experiment.Dilute 1 µl resulting solutions 1,000× with water.Determine the concentration of the diluted UDP-[14C]Glc prepared in Step C1b using the absorbance at 261 nm and the molar extinction coefficient (ϵ) of uridine at 261 nm (10.1 mM/cm).To determine the radioactivity of the diluted UDP-[14C]Glc used in Step C1b, transfer 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 200 µl diluted sample to scintillation vials, add 3 ml scintillation fluid, and count the radioactivity on a liquid scintillation counter (LSC).Plot the amount (nmol) of UDP-[14C]Glc according to the radioactivity (cpm) of each sample. The specific radioactivity can be calculated by the slope of a linear fit (cpm/nmol).To prepare a working solution of UDP-[14C]Glc, dilute the stock solution with non-radioactive UDP-Glc and determine the specific radioactivity by following the Steps C1b–C1e. In our experience, UDP-[14C]Glc with ~800 cpm/nmol specific radioactivity allows detection of glucan formation from 5 µl reaction solution with as short as a 30-s incubation.Thaw aliquots of stored GS on ice. We typically perform activity assays with a 30–50 µg/ml final concentration of protein in a 30-µl scale.Prepare a 2× assay buffer as described in the Recipe section.",
    "Incubate the 2× assay buffer and GS in a 30°C water bath for 15 min.Prepare filter plates for quenching and filtering the insoluble glucan. Add 200 µl 10% w/v TCA to each filter plate well. Each well will be used to quench each timepoint.Initiate reactions by adding 1 volume of GS to 1 volume of 2× assay buffer. Mix the solution by pipetting up and down as well as closing the caps of the tubes and gently flicking and briefly vortexing before returning to the water bath. Note that this is important for reproducible results as the GS is stored in 30% glycerol, which requires thorough mixing to yield a homogeneous solution.Incubate the reaction at 30°C.At each time point, transfer a 5–20 µl aliquot of the reaction to the filter plate wells containing 200 µl 10% w/v TCA (prepared in Step C5). Mix the solution by pipetting up and down.After quenching all the time points, apply a vacuum using the vacuum manifold to filter the quenched solution. Wash the filter with 3 × 200 µl 10% TCA, followed by 2 × 200 µl EtOH to remove unincorporated UDP-[14C]Glc.The filters can be allowed to dry overnight or can be analyzed immediately. Remove the plastic support from the bottom of the plate and position the well over an empty scintillation vial. Using a cotton swab, push the filter through the PVDF membrane into the scintillation vial. Break the swab handle so that the vial cap can be closed. If the PVDF membrane remains attached to the plate, transfer to the scintillation vial using a pair of tweezers.Add 3 ml scintillation fluid, tightly close the vial, and vortex and shake to ensure that the filter is submerged.Determine the radioactivity of each vial.",
    "We set the scintillation counter to a preset time of 3 min, or a % error of 5.0, whichever was shorter.Quantitative detection of GS product by SEC-PAD analysisThaw the frozen GS solution on ice.Prepare a 2× assay buffer.Preincubate both the GS and the 2× assay buffer for 15 min in a 30°C water bath.Prepare the filter plates for quenching and filtering the insoluble glucan. Add 100 µl or an appropriate volume of 10% w/v TCA to each well of the plate. See Step D7.Initiate the reaction by mixing equal volumes of GS and 2× assay buffer, and mix well by pipetting, flicking, and brief vortexing before returning to the water bath. Note that this is important for reproducible results as the GS is stored in 30% glycerol, which can result in poor mixing and irreproducible results. See Step C6.Incubate the reaction at 30°C.At defined time points, remove two aliquots and quench separately.Quench the first aliquot by mixing 5 µl reaction mixture with 100 µl 10% TCA in one of the filter plate wells. This quenched solution will be used to determine the total amount of glucan.Quench the second aliquot of reaction mixture (25–200 µl) with 5–10 equivalents of 2% (w/v) SDS solution in a separate well. This quenched solution will be used for length determination by SEC. Do not use acid quenching for length determination since acid-denatured membrane proteins are difficult to remove and interfere with the SEC analysis.Note: As the filter plate wells only fit ~250 µl volume, for larger aliquots, reactions need to be quenched in larger tubes and transferred to a single well for workup. Wash the well(s) from Step D7a with 3 × 200 µl 10% TCA, followed by 3 × 200 µl EtOH.",
    "Wash the well(s) from Step D7b with 5 × 200 µl 2% SDS, 5 × 200 µl H2O, and 5 × 200 µl EtOH. The wash with SDS is critical for removing proteins that interact with glucan since they interfere with the SEC analysis.Dry the filters in the wells overnight under a vacuum.Transfer the filters from Step D8 to liquid scintillation vials for LSC to determine the total amount of glucose incorporated in the reaction at each timepoint. See Step C10.Transfer the filters form Step D9 to a 1.5-ml screw top vial and add 200 µl 1 M NaOH.Note: Use freshly diluted NaOH from a 50% w/w solution. Briefly centrifuge to ensure that the filter is well submerged in the solution, and then sonicate in an ice-water bath for 10 min.Note: Longer sonication or sonication at higher temperatures can result in more significant degradation of the glucan polymers and affect the final length calculation and elution profile of the glucan product. Briefly centrifuge the mixture again and transfer 100 µl to a freash 1.5-ml vial.Using a wide-bore pipet tip (or regular pipet tip with the extremity cut off to increase the diameter), break apart the filter and resuspend in the solution.Briefly centrifuge the mixture, remove an additional ~80 µl from the tube, and combine with the solution in Step D14.Centrifuge the combined solution from Step D16 at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to remove any particulates.Transfer 150 µl supernatant to an HPLC vial insert for SEC analysis.Transfer a 5-µl aliquot of the supernatant to a scintillation vial and analyze by LSC to determine the glucan recovery yield. We typically recover 60–90% of the radioactivity.Analyze 25 µl each sample by SEC-PAD-RC using the ICS-5000+ DC Chromatography/Detector System equipped with an Acclaim SEC-1000 column at 30°C.",
    "Chromatography is performed by isocratic elution with 10 mM NaOH at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min and monitored by PAD (Gold, Carbo, Quad waveform).Using a fraction collector, fractionate the elution every 0.5 min during 5–15 min of the chromatography, transfer 120 µl fraction to scintillation vials, and analyze by LSC to determine the radioactive glucose in each fraction.To determine a standard curve for calibration of the SEC, inject pullulan standards P-82 (Showa Denko K.K.) and analyze under the same conditions as described in Step D20.Export the chromatography data from the Chameleon software into Excel to calculate the properties of the samples, as detailed in section Data analysis B."
