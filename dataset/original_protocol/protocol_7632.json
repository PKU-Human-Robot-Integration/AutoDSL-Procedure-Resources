    "A schematic of the workflow for the analysis of DolPs is shown in Figure 2. The different procedures involved in this workflow are mentioned below.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20231120/20231120185024_9485.pngFigure 2. Overview of the developed workflow, including sample preparation, methylation, and reverse phase liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (RPLC-MS) analysis of dolichyl phosphates (DolPs) Note: Below mentioned steps should take place in a cold room or on ice where possible. Thaw the biological samples, such as HeLa/fibroblast cells (~1 M cells) or S. cerevisiae cells (~0.8 OD), on ice for 20 min.If performing Hela cells extraction, skip this step. Suspend S. cerevisiae cell pellets in 200 μL of 155 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer. Add 0.5 mm glass beads to samples and vortex for 1 min. Then, centrifuge samples at 3,500× g for 1 min at room temperature (RT). Transfer the aqueous (top) layer to a clean microcentrifuge tube.Add 20 pmol of internal standard (IS) PolP C60 to cell pellets/lysates.Add 1 mL of methanol and vortex for 1 min at normal speed, followed by sonication for 1 min in an ultrasonic water bath sonicator.Add 1 mL of water and vortex for 1 min at normal speed, followed by sonication for 1 min with an ultrasonic water bath sonicator.Centrifuge at 3,500× g for 5 min at RT.Note: If you wish to normalize DolP amounts to total lipid/total phosphatidylcholine (PC) (as bulk membrane lipid), measure the total lipid/PC levels of samples at this point. See Özbalci et al. (2013) for the procedure to determine the total lipid/PC levels of samples (Özbalci et al., 2013). Procedure for alkaline hydrolysis and extraction Note: Use round bottom screw-top glass tubes with Teflon-lined caps for DolP sample preparation. Dichloromethane (which is added in subsequent steps) can dissolve plastic materials. Therefore, always use glass bottles, pipettes, and syringes while working with dichloromethane.",
    "Fill the water bath with distilled water to the upper level of 2.5 mL of solvent in a glass tube immersed in the water bath. Heat the water bath to 85 °C.Add 0.5 mL of 15 M KOH to samples to initialize alkaline hydrolysis.Vortex for 1 min, followed by centrifugation at 3,500× g for 5 min at RT.Then, immerse glass tubes in a preheated linear shaking water bath at 85 °C for 1 h, under constant shaking at 40 rpm.Note: This strong alkaline treatment releases DolP from DolP-linked monosaccharides, dolichyl diphosphate (DolPP)-linked mono- and oligosaccharides, and DolPP (Keller et al., 1985; Lee Adair and Kennedy Keller, 1985; Fernandez et al., 2001; Schenk et al., 2001). Cool samples to RT. Vortex for 1 min, followed by centrifugation at ~3,500× g for 5 min at RT.Increase the level of water in the water bath with distilled water to the upper level of 7.5 mL of solvent in a glass tube immersed in the water bath. Heat the water bath to 40 °C.To the cooled samples, carefully add 1 mL of methanol and 4 mL of dichloromethane to induce phase partitioning.Then, immerse glass tubes in a preheated linear shaking water bath at 40 °C for 1 h, under constant shaking at 40 rpm.Cool the samples at RT; then, vortex and centrifuge at 3,500× g for 5 min at RT.Following centrifugation, remove the upper aqueous phase using a Pasteur pipette and wash the lower organic phase four times with wash solvent (see Recipes).Carefully transfer the bottom layer to a new glass tube using a Pasteur pipette.Dry samples under a gentle stream of nitrogen at RT in a Turbovap evaporator.Methylation of DolPs Note: Inhaling TMSD may cause lung injury or central nervous system depression. TMSD must be handled with caution and following proper safety standards.",
    "Before starting the reaction, ensure that the hood is working properly. When working with TMSD, personal safety equipment such as lab aprons, latex gloves, goggles, and respirators should be worn at all times. Screw cap glass tubes immediately after the addition of the reagents. QC standard: methylate DolP standard and IS mixture along with samples. In a screw-top glass tube, take 20 pmol of DolP standard and 20 pmol of IS and dry under a gentle stream of nitrogen.Add 200 μL of dichloromethane:methanol mixture (6.5:5.2, v:v, see Recipes) to dried samples.Vortex for 1 min followed by centrifugation at 3,500× g for 5 min at RT.To these tubes, carefully add 10 μL of TMSD using a gas-tight Hamilton syringe.Vortex for 1 min, followed by centrifugation at 3,500× g for 5 min at RT.Incubate for 40 min at RT.Note: The chemical reaction of TMSD (yellow) with the acetic acid produces (colorless) methyl acetate. After adding TMSD to the lipid extracts, the solution should have a faint yellow color. If the yellow color associated with TMSD disappears in the solution, add TMSD in 5 μL increments until a yellow color appears. It is recommended to dry the lipid extracts completely before methylation to avoid neutralization of TMSD. When the reaction is complete, neutralize excess TMSD by slowly adding 10 μL of acetic acid.Note: The color of the solution should change from yellow to colorless after the addition of acetic acid. Add acetic acid in 5 μL increments until the yellow color disappears. Dry samples under a gentle stream of nitrogen at RT in a Turbovap evaporator.For LC–HRMS analysis, reconstitute dried samples in 120 μL of methanol. Vortex for 1 min and transfer lipid films to micro inserts placed in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes.",
    "Centrifuge the samples in Eppendorf tubes in a microcentrifuge at 1,500× g for 5 min at 4 °C. Transfer micro inserts to LC vials for analysis.LC system preparation Prepare Solvents A and B according to Recipes.Mix each solvent thoroughly by shaking and degas both solvents in the water bath sonicator with loose caps for at least 10 min.Put up both solvents on the LC system and purge all lines for 5 min.Set the flow rate to 0.1 mL/min with both solvents in the ratio 60:40 (solvent A:B).Maintain the column at 55 °C.Equilibrate the column for at least 15 min after the column pressure is stable.Set the LC gradient as follows: 40% B at 0 min, 40%–50% B (0–3 min), 50%–54% B (3–9 min), 54%–70% B (9–9.1 min), 70%–90% B (9.1–17 min), 90% B (17–27.5 min), 90%–40% B (27.5–27.6 min), and 40% B (27.6–30 min).MS system preparation Note: Perform mass calibration for the mass spectrometer with XCalibur software. Set the tune MS parameters to the ESI positive mode, as shown in Table 2.Table 2. MS parameters used for Q-Exactive Plus high-resolution mass spectrometer table:",
