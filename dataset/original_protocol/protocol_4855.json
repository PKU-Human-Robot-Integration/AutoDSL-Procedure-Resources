    "The following procedure describes the steps to collect the contents from the large intestine of one mouse. The protocol can be adapted to the collection of small intestine contents as well.    Euthanize mouse according to institutional guidelines using a CO2 euthanasia chamber.   Cut the skin of the abdomen without disrupting the peritoneum (Figure 1A).   Cut the peritoneum to expose the small and large intestines (Figure 1B).   Carefully push the intestines out of the abdomen and isolate the complete small and large intestines by cutting just after the stomach and as low as possible of the colon (Figure 1C).    Remove large intestine from the beginning of the cecum to the end of the colon. Transfer intestine to a 100 mm culture dish placed on ice (Figure 1D).    Flush out intestinal contents with up to 10 ml of ice-cold PBS using a 12 ml syringe + 23 G x 1” needle (Figure 1E, F).    Disperse intestinal contents in the PBS by applying pressure with a 3 ml syringe plunger (Figure 1G). Transfer contents to a 50 ml tube (Figure 1H).   Pellet the contents by centrifugation at 2,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C (Figure 1I).   Pour off and discard the supernatant by gentle inversion of the tube.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160911/20160911221846_6510.jpg Figure 1. Intestinal contents collection.

Flushing out cecum (E) and colon (F) contents with PBS. G. Dispersing intestinal contents by using a plunger. H. Transfer contents into a 50 ml tube. I. Pellet contents after centrifugation.    Tare analytical balance with empty 50 ml tube and adjust to zero. Weigh the tube with pelleted intestinal contents.",
    "Resuspend the pellet in freshly prepared protease inhibitor cocktail (see Recipes) at a concentration of 2 g/ml.   Freeze pellet in -80 °C freezer for 20 min, then thaw for 20 min and vortex at maximum speed for 5 sec to disrupt bacterial cells. Repeat the freeze/thaw/vortex cycle two additional times.    To complete cell lysis, sonicate the contents for 30 sec on ice, followed by 30 sec rest on ice. Sonicate 5 times in total (use power setting #2 for up to 2 ml of sample with fixed vibration frequency at 20 KHz) (Figure 2).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160911/20160911222127_5341.jpg Figure 2. Cell lysis of the intestinal contents by sonication. Following three freeze/thaw/vortex cycles, contents are sonicated on ice. The sonicator apparatus (A) and the procedure (B).    Transfer the contents to 1.5 ml microtubes and centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C.   The protein-rich supernatant is aspirated (typically 1 to 2 ml) without disturbing the pellet and collected into a 15 ml tube placed on ice.   Sterilize the extract using a 1 ml syringe and a 0.22 μm syringe filter (Figure 3).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160911/20160911222327_5763.jpg Figure 3. Sterilization of the extract. After centrifugation, bacteria-rich protein supernatant/extract is collected and passed through a 0.22 μm syringe filter.    Determine protein concentration of extract using Bradford protein assay kit or equivalent, following manufacturer’s protocol. We suggest a neat, 1:10, 1:100, and 1:1,000 dilution of the extract for the assay to ensure that the result falls on the standard curve.   The amount of extract to be used to stimulate cells in vitro may vary according to the experimental design. In the original article (Horai et al., 2015), 10-500 μg/ml of extract was used to stimulate retina-specific autoreactive T cells in vitro."
