    "Cell propagationPropagate a 1:50 dilution of an overnight culture of B. subtilis strains in 25 ml of PAB medium (supplemented with 0.1 mM IPTG, if necessary, see Recipes). Incubate at 37 °C with vigorous shaking (250 rpm), monitor growth by taking periodical readings on a spectrophotometer set at 600 nm. Plot OD600 nm versus time in a semi-log sheet and identify time zero (T0), defined as the time point in the culture when the slopes of the logarithmic and stationary phases of growth intercept (see Supplemental Figure S1[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20171120/Supplemental Figure S1.docx]). 90 min after T0, transfer 10 ml of the culture to a sterile 15-ml Falcon tube and centrifuge (4, 800 x g; 10 min, 23 °C); wash cell pellets 3 times each with 10 ml of 1x SS (see Recipes) and resuspend in an equal volume of the same solution.Viable countsDetermine the initial number of bacteria for each strain by preparing serial ten-fold dilutions in 1x SS, plating dilutions 10-5 to 10-7 on SMM supplemented with histidine, methionine and leucine, incubating for 48 h at 37 °C and scoring the number of CFU per ml.Selective pressureTake aliquots of 1 ml of the cell suspension and, independently, transfer to three 50-ml Falcon tubes containing 49 ml of soft agar SA (one tube with SA1 and two for SA2) pre-warmed at 42 °C. Decant 4 ml of the final suspension onto each of 12 plates of SMM-His-Leu- and 24 plates of SMM-Met-Leu-, allow to solidify and incubate the plates at 37 °C for 10 days. Of note, supplement plates with 1 mM IPTG to activate nrdEF expression in strain B. subtilis PERM1017.",
    "Note: The combination (His-, Met-) in addition to the absence of three amino acids (His-, Leu-, Met-) is not used to avoid favor suppressor mutations that have been suggested revert His and Met auxotrophies simultaneously (Sung and Yasbin, 2002). Note: Soft agar for inoculation (SA) helps to maintain cells immobilized; thus, avoiding the spread of colonies during Procedure D (colony growth). Colony growthDuring days 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, pick two plates of His- Leu- medium and four plates of Met- Leu-, proceed to prepare soft agar to obtain His- (SA3), Met- (SA4) or Leu- (SA5) media (see Recipes). Over these SMM plates pour a first overlay with the cells and a second overlay with the selective medium (Figure 1 and Supplemental Figure S2[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20171120/Supplemental Figure S2.docx]). This results in single amino acid dropout media that selects for His+, Met+ or Leu+ revertants. Incubate the plates at 37 °C and record the number of revertants His+, Met+, and Leu+ colonies that arise after 48 h of incubation. Determine the average number of revertants from the two plates used for each selective media at the respective day of incubation; calculate the mutation frequency using the accumulated number of revertants and the number of CFU plated.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171129/20171129174926_7451.jpgFigure 1. Procedure for Stationary-phase mutagenesis soft-agar overlay assays. A. Cell propagation. Cultivate Bacillus subtilis strains PERM1017, YB955 and PERM1202 in PAB medium until 90 min after the end of exponential growth; wash with 1x SS. B. Viable counts, colony forming units are determined by serial ten-fold dilutions. C. Selective pressure. Cells are plated on selective medium using the corresponding soft agar overlay (SA1 or SA2) and incubated for 10 days at 37 °C. D. Colony growth.",
    "A second soft agar overlay (SA3, SA4 or SA5) is added to a set of plates of each selective medium to restore one of the missing amino acids, revertant His+, Met+ and Leu+ colonies are scored after 48 h of incubation. E. Cell survival is monitored during days 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 from selection SMM-His-Leu- and SMM-Met-Leu- plates as described in Procedure E. In case of strain PERM1017, media must be supplemented with 1 mM IPTG, as indicated in the procedure (perform this procedure on days 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10) (Pybus et al., 2010).Cell survivalDetermine the abilities of strains with different genotypes to survive in SMM-His-Leu- or SMM-Met-Leu- plates during the ten days of the experiment. Employing sterile Pasteur pipettes, during days, 2, 4, 6, and 8, remove three-agar plugs from areas free of colonies of media plates employed for ‘selective pressure’ (Procedure C). This procedure allows quantifying the initially plated fraction of non-revertant cells that have survived the incubation period. Suspend the plugs in 400 µl of 1x SS, vortex thoroughly, plate serial ten-dilutions on SMM containing all the essential amino acids (50 μg/ml). Score the number of colonies after 48 h of incubation at 37 °C.Note: A representative example is presented in Table S1[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20171120/Supplemental Table S1.docx]. The data are from an experiment of SPM using soft agar overlay for the hisC allele in strain B. subtilis YB955."
