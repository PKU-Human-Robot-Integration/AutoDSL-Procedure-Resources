    "All methods described here using zebrafish are covered under Dr. Kristen Kwan's animal protocol, \"Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms of Visual System Development in Zebrafish\", and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Utah.\n1. Capped RNA Synthesis\nGenerate the DNA template for in vitro transcription.\n\t\nLinearize the DNA template by digesting 10 µg of DNA in 100 µL volume of the reaction mixture. A typical reaction is assembled as follows: digest 10 µg DNA using 3 µL of enzyme and 10 µL of buffer, bring the reaction volume to 100 µL with water.\n\t\t​NOTE: A typical template for digest is a pCS2 vector, for example, pCS2-EGFP-CAAX or pCS2FA-H2A.F/Z-mCherry for the membrane and chromatin labeling described here. In this case, the plasmid DNAs are each digested using the enzyme NotI. Users should be cautious of star activity; in this case, a high-fidelity enzyme is recommended and commercially available.\nIncubate the reaction at 37 °C overnight to ensure that the DNA is digested to completion.\nClean up the restriction digest using a PCR purification kit following the manufacturer's protocol. Elute the DNA with 30 µL ddH2O. Store the linearized DNA at -20 °C and use as needed.\n\t\t​NOTE: The amount of DNA digested and the elution volume yield approximately 0.3 µg/µL; this is sufficient for ~5 rounds of in vitro transcription, each round using ~2 µg of DNA as template.\nIn vitro transcribe capped RNA using an in vitro transcription kit. For pCS2 templates (as described here), use an SP6 kit.\n\t\nAssemble the in vitro transcription reaction, as follows: Digest 2 µg of DNA template or up to 6 µL with 2 µL of 10x Reaction Buffer, 10 µL of 2x Ribonucleotide Mix, and 2 µL of 10x Enzyme Mix.",
    "Incubate at 37 °C for 2-4 h or longer (longer times will lead to greater yield). If desired, 1 µL of Enzyme Mix can be supplemented halfway through the incubation period.\nDigest the DNA template by adding 1 µL of RNase-free DNase and incubating for 15 min at 37 °C.\nPurify the capped RNA using an RNA purification kit following manufacturer's protocol (see Table of Materials). Elute with 100 µL of RNase-free H2O.\n\tNOTE: The addition of β-mercaptoethanol is not necessary for this application. While the method described in this protocol is straightforward, alternative reagents can also be used to purify RNA.\nPrecipitate the RNA.\n\t\nAdd 10 µL of 3 M RNase-free NaOAc and 2.5 volumes (~275 µL) of ice-cold RNase-free 100% EtOH to the eluted RNA.\nIncubate the reaction at -20 °C for 15-30 min. Spin for 15 min at high speed at 4 °C to pellet the RNA.\n\t\t​NOTE: The pellet should be visible against the wall of the tube. It is helpful to note how the tube is aligned in the centrifuge at this step, in order to predict where the pellet should be at the end of the spin.\nRemove EtOH carefully with a syringe, being careful to avoid heating, over-drying, or dislodging the pellet. Resuspend the pellet in 20 µL of RNase-free H2O.\nCheck the RNA to ensure that the synthesis is successful. Use 1 µL to assay concentration on a spectrophotometer and run 0.5 µL on a 1% agarose gel to check for one or two discrete bands, rather than a low molecular weight smear. The yield of the in vitro transcription reaction should be ~1 µg/µL.\nAliquot and store RNA at -20 °C or -80 °C. The RNA is not diluted until immediately prior to injections.\n2. Microinjection of 1-cell zebrafish embryos",
    "NOTE: Inject 200-300 pg per RNA to obtain ubiquitous expression of chromatin and cell membranes throughout optic cup morphogenesis. Prepare 5-10 µL of the RNA dilution, and load 2.5-5 µL/needle; plan for extra in the event the needle breaks.\nAdvance preparations for injections.\n\t\nPrepare an injection mold dish to facilitate alignment and orientation of 1-cell embryos for microinjection. Melt 2% agarose in E3 (standard embryo medium) and pour into a Petri dish. Carefully float the injection mold (see Table of Materials) on the top of the hot agarose to generate the imprint of the troughs in the agarose as it solidifies. Once the agarose solidifies, remove the injection mold.\n\t\tNOTE: Injection mold dishes can be used for several months; cover in E3 and store at 4 °C when not in use.\nPull microinjection needles. Pull glass capillaries to a long taper to make microinjection needles using a needle puller machine. Program the machine specific to the type of capillaries used. For 1.0 x 0.78 mm borosilicate capillaries use the following program: heat = 546 °C, pull = 130, velocity = 70, time = 90 (Figure 2F). Store the needles in a Petri dish and secure it with modeling clay.\n\t\tNOTE: The pulling recipe will vary, depending on the machine and filament, and new filaments should always be calibrated. Each round of pulling produces two needles (Figure 2G); do this several times to produce enough needles in case of accidental breaks and future experiments.",
    "Dilute the capped RNA for injection. Dilute both EGFP-CAAX and H2A-mCherry RNAs to 200-300 ng/µL concentration using RNase-free H2O and 1 µL of phenol red in a total volume of 5 µL (final concentration of phenol red is 0.1%). Flick the mixture and briefly spin down to collect the total volume. Keep the diluted RNA on ice prior to injecting.\nInjection of 1-cell embryos\n\t\nOnce the fish begin to breed, allow ~15-20 min to ensure that the eggs become fertilized. During this time, backload the needle with 2.5-5 µL of the RNA dilution using a P10 and P10 micro-loader tips.\nUsing a picoinjector, calibrate the needle using an eyepiece reticle (a micrometer calibration slide is also sufficient) to measure the volume of the droplet (volume of a sphere = (4/3) * pi * radius^3). Adjust the injection time and pressure such that the injection volume is 1 nL (Figure 2I).\nWith a roller/transfer pipette, carefully load eggs into the injection mold (Figure 2J). If helpful, use forceps to roll embryos such that the single cell is visible, either prior to or during injection. It is the user's preference to use a micromanipulator.\nInject embryos at the 1-cell stage, targeting the cell and not the yolk (Figure 2M). This will ensure uniform labeling of the developing embryo.\nRaise embryos to the desired stage (prior to 12 hpf, according to standard staging34). Injected embryos will have a delayed development, so raise them at a slightly higher temperature (29.0-29.5 °C) to make up time. During the afternoon, check the embryos and remove those that are dead to preserve the health of the clutch.\n3. Mounting optic vesicle stage zebrafish embryos for timelapse imaging",
    "Before mounting, prepare 1.6% low-melt agarose in E3. If planning multiple imaging experiments, prepare ~20 mL of low-melt agarose and store at room temperature. On the day of embryo mounting, melt this to generate a fresh aliquot (1-5 mL) in a tube that can be placed in a 42 °C heat block prior to mounting.\nScreen embryos for successful injection and overall brightness of fluorescence using a fluorescence microscope prior to mounting. An ideal sample will have strong EGFP and mCherry fluorescence and be at the correct developmental stage (Figure 3B - B'').\n\t\nScreen embryos using a fluorescence microscope. Select embryos that strongly express both EGFP and mCherry fluorescence for mounting.\nSelect embryos that are 11 hpf. Count somites to properly stage the embryos34; at 11 hpf there should be 3 somites, and by 12 hpf there are 6 somites.\n\t\t​NOTE: By mounting embryos prior to 12 hpf (at 11 hpf), the samples will be appropriately staged at 12 hpf when the timelapse begins.\nDechorionate embryos prior to mounting. Do this either manually with fine forceps or chemically using pronase (2 mg/mL). With embryos this young, it is essential that dechorionation is performed within an agar-coated dish and that embryos do not contact the air-water interface.\nUsing a glass roller pipette, suck up an embryo and eject as much E3 as possible such that the embryo sits at the tip of the glass Pasteur pipette.\nDrop the embryo into the tube of agarose from the heat block. Let it sink into the agarose for a few seconds, then suck up some agarose first and then the embryo, making sure that the embryo remains at the tip of the pipette (Figure 3C - C').",
    "Place a glass-bottom dish for imaging under a dissecting scope. Eject the embryo and agarose into an agarose droplet in the glass-bottom dish. Use forceps to very quickly orient, such that the embryo is dorsal-down (top of head on the glass bottom). Allow the agarose droplet to harden (Figure 3D - D'). This step must be done quickly but carefully, as embryos at this stage are fragile. Damaged embryos will not survive the timelapse imaging process.\n\tNOTE: It is important to orient all embryos consistently for this experiment. When performing the timelapse, the embryos must fit within the assigned field of view while maintaining additional space for the optic vesicle to grow into. An optimal orientation is to align the anterior-posterior axis of all embryos \"vertically\" or along 12 and 6 o'clock on a clock face (Figure 3G).\nMount between 10-12 embryos, which is more than twice as many that will be imaged, so that the best samples can be selected once evaluated on the confocal (Figure 3E - E'). Samples will be evaluated for age, uniformity of fluorescent labeling, and precision of mounting orientation.\nAfter mounting the embryos, pipette more agarose to completely cover the bottom of the dish, thereby encasing all of the separate agarose droplets in a single large agarose disc (Figure 3F - F'). A sufficient amount of agarose will ensure that the individual embryo droplets or the entire disc does not lift up from the bottom of the dish and float out of view.\nOnce hardened, overlay the agarose with E3 to keep the samples hydrated for the duration of the timelapse imaging experiment (a concern depending on the humidity of the building and in the environment).",
    "NOTE: Tricaine is not necessary for these specific timelapse imaging experiments, as these embryos are sufficiently young; however, if desired, and if working with older stages of embryos, tricaine can be added into the agarose itself and overlaid in the media.\nOn paper, draw a map of the embryos for easy reference during timelapse set up. This is crucial to later associate the position with the genotype of each sample.\n4. Multiple position confocal timelapse with a laser scanning confocal microscope\nNOTE: This timelapse imaging protocol was designed to be used with a laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with manufacturer's software (see Table of Materials). This system is equipped with a piezo Z-stage device that allows rapid acquisition of Z-stacks. The laser lines used in this protocol are a 488 nm Argon ion laser and a DPSS 561 nm laser. The 561 nm laser is well-suited for imaging the mCherry fluorophore: it is close enough to the peak of mCherry excitation (587 nm) and well-powered.\nSet up the confocal.\n\t\nPower on the confocal and log into the desktop computer.\nInstall the piezo Z-stage insert (Figure 4B), then start the acquisition software.\nIn the software within Acquisition mode, turn on the 488 and 561 lasers using the drop-down menu (Figure 4F). The lasers take several minutes to warm up, so this step is performed early to save time.",
    "NOTE: The acquisition parameters are as follows: Check the Z-stack, Time Series, and Position boxes. Set Frame Size to 512 (X) x 384 (Y), Scan Speed to 9, Scan Mode to bidirectional, Zoom to 0.7, Pinhole to 60.2 (1.63 Airy Units ~= 1.6 µm section), and Z-interval to 2.1 µm. This will yield an image size of 303.6 µm x 227.7 µm, and pixel size of 0.59 µm. The 488 and 561 lasers should be checked and assigned to the same track; the EGFP detection range is 494-545 nm and the mCherry detection range is 598-679 (Figure 4F).\nLiberally coat the bottom of the glass dish with immersion medium matching the refractive index of water, being careful to avoid air bubbles (Figure 4C). Select the 40x water objective and apply a small drop of immersion medium to the objective (Figure 4D). Secure the glass-bottomed dish in the stage insert, apply E3 to keep the embryos moist overnight, then use modeling clay to seal the plastic lid over the dish (Figure 4E). Raise the objective to make contact with the dish.\nScreen samples and prepare for timelapse.\n\t\nSwitch from the Acquisition tab to the Locate tab and click on the lightbulb symbol to turn on transmitted light. With the transmitted light, locate the first sample with the joystick: by eye, first move the sample into the beam of light, then use the eyepieces to the center and focus on an optic vesicle.\nReturn to the Acquisition tab. Ensure that the Z-stack, Time Series, and Positions boxes are checked, and the lasers are warmed up for use.\nSet the Frame Size to 512 (X) x 384 (Y), Scan Speed to 9, Scan Mode to bidirectional, and set Zoom to 0.7.",
    "Under the Channels heading, begin by assigning the 488 and 561 lasers to Power 2.0 and Gain 550 (this can be adjusted later). Set the pinhole to 60.2 (1.63 Airy Units ~= 1.6 µm section).\nBegin scanning using the Continuous button. With the fine focus knob, locate the sample in the Z-axis and position the X-Y axis in frame. Stop scanning.\nUnder the Positions heading, click on Add to save the XYZ information on the first sample (Figure 4F). Do this only for samples to be timelapsed. Select samples for their strong fluorescence and optimal mounting.\nSwitch to the Locate tab, move to the next sample, and repeat steps 4.2.5-4.2.6, being selective about choosing samples.\nFinalize sample positions, assign z-range, and then start timelapse. Once all the samples are selected (it is possible to image 4-5 samples within the 2.5-minute total time interval) and positions are saved, go through each sample and adjust the XYZ position within the viewing frame.\n\t\nHighlight the first position and click on Move To. While continuously scanning, line up the optic vesicle within the frame. Leave ample space in the anterior and distal regions relative to the optic vesicle and the brain.\nNext, assign the first and last Z-slices by selecting Set First and Set Last while moving through the Z-direction with the fine focus knob. Maintain a total slice number of ~63, as this will accommodate the growth of the optic cup. Provide extra room on the ventral side of the optic vesicle to allow room for growth.",
    "Once first and last Z-slices have been set, click on the C button to move to the center of the Z-stack. Adjust laser power and gain for both lasers; if possible, keep the laser power below 5 and use a higher gain, if necessary. Stop Scanning. Update the position information by clicking on Update.\nMove to the next position by clicking on Position 2. Repeat steps 4.3.1-4.3.3 for each assigned position. The laser power and gain should be set such that all samples are sufficiently illuminated.\nOnce both position information and laser settings are finalized, assign Time Series settings. Under the Time Series heading, assign Time Interval to 2.5 min, and Cycles to 300 (Figure 4F). The number of cycles is calculated such that the timelapse proceeds past the 24 hpf stage, when optic cup development is complete.\nTo begin the timelapse, click on Start. Monitor the first complete cycle: use a timer to ensure one complete cycle (imaging all positions) is less than 2.5 min and verify that each position looks correct. The microscope runs independently overnight and does not need to be monitored.\n\t\t​NOTE: Although the confocal room is temperature controlled, the room temperature is 20-25 °C. With the equipment running and the lasers scanning, the temperature on the stage appears to be closer to 28.5 °C, since embryonic development proceeds at this expected rate, as assayed visually with morphological landmarks.\nWith these settings, the timelapse will last 12.5 h. Save the file once the timelapse is complete. It will be large (~40 GB) and can be separated into individual positions after it is saved using the acquisition software."
