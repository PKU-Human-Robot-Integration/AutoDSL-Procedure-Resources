    "All experiments were conducted in conformity with the European Community Directive 2010/63/EU and were approved by the Italian Ministry of Health.\n1. Animal Care, Housing and Treatment\nPerform all experimental protocols using mice in accordance with the guidelines of the respective institutional animal care.\nMaintain animals in a 12 hr light/dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum.\nHouse the mice in groups of 2-4, in standard-sized polycarbonate mouse cages with sawdust and bedding material changed weekly.\nUse age and sex-matched mice, because susceptibility to disease can vary with age and gender in different mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders.\nChoose an appropriate number of animals to reach statistical significance (a minimum of 10 mice per genotype for the behavioral study and 4 mice per genotype for the immunohistochemistry experiment).\n2. Morris Water Maze (MWM)\nUse a Circular Tank (diameter 100 cm, height 50 cm).\n\t\nPlace some visual cues on the room dividers around the tank.\nPlace a 10 cm diameter platform into the tank at a fixed location in the center of one of four imaginary quadrants. Keep the hidden platform in the same quadrant for all trials across all training sessions.\nFill the pool with tap water until the platform is 1 cm above the water surface. Equilibrate water temperature should be close to 22 °C; this step may take several hours. Add hot water to shorten the time required to equilibrate water temperature.\nAdd approximately 1.5-2 L of white, non-toxic paint to make the water opaque.\nTrack Acquisition Procedure\n\t\nSet up MWM’s tracking system with standard CCD cameras and video boards. Choose a video-tracking system to monitor and analyze several variables such as path length, escape latency, and time spent in each quadrant.",
    "Divide the arena in four quadrants and adjust detection settings to ensure optimal contrast between animals and background for live tracking.\nSpecify the platform region.\nSet the maximum trial time as 60 sec.\nMWM Testing\n\t\nPrior to behavior testing, allow mice an adaptation period of 20-25 min in an area where they cannot see the pool or spatial cues.\nTrain each mouse for 9 days (two consecutive trials a day, with 20-30 min interval between them).\nSwitch on the computer and the camera and start the video-tracking system software.\nTake the mouse by its tail and place it into water, with its head pointed towards the side of pool, starting from one of the four start positions (north, south, east, west). For each mouse, the start position should be different and pseudorandomized across trials.\nLet the mouse swim and search for the platform for a maximum of 60 sec. Once the animal reaches the platform, allow it to stay on the platform for 20 sec.\nIf mouse failed to locate the platform within that time, gently guide the mouse to the platform, holding it by its tail and let it to stay there for 20 sec. Once the animal has completed all two trials, dry it off with a towel and put it back into cage.\nEach day of the training period, repeat the same procedure (steps 2.3.4-2.3.6).\nPerform the probe test on day 9 after the last training trail.\nRemove the platform from the pool.\nLet the mouse swim and search for the platform for a maximum of 60 sec.\nPeriodically, check the water temperature so that it should be the same (22 °C) and clean out the pool.\n3. Preparation of Sections from Perfused Animals",
    "Sacrifice the mice at the end of MWM. Four mice per genotype must be anesthetized prior to euthanization according to local and international guidelines.\nPerfuse the animal transcardially (cut the right auriclewith a scissor to allow bleeding and introduce a butterfly cannula into the left ventricle to perfuse) with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 4-5 min, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10-15 min22.\nDissect and post-fix the brains in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for at least 12 hr.\nPlace the brains in 50 ml polystyrene conical tubes containing 15 ml of 0.02% Sodium Azide in 0.1 M PBS and store at 4 °C until required for slicing.\nCut and remove the cerebellum before vibratome cutting.\nGlue the brain upright with the cutting site, using superglue, onto the holder plate of the vibratome.\nCut the brain into 20-40 µm thick coronal sections, in serial order throughout the dorsal hippocampus, on appropriate vibratome.\nCollect vibratome slices with a paint brush and transfer to a 24 multi-well plate containing 1 ml of 0.1 M PBS for each well.\nStore sections for short term in PBS or long term in 0.02% Sodium Azide in PBS at 4 ºC (tissue might be used for up to one year).\n4. Immunohistochemistry\nTransfer 3-5 dorsal hippocampal sections for each mouse, into 24 multi-well plate containing 500 µl of 0.1 M PBS for each well.\nWash the sections contained in each well with 500 µl of 0.1 M PBS (5 min,  3 times with gentle shaking).\nQuench endogenous peroxidase activity, by incubating sections in 1% H2O2 in PBS for 20 min with gentle agitation.\nWash sections in 0.1 M PBS with gentle agitation (3 x 5 min).\nPermeabilization of tissue: incubate sections for 5 min in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS.",
    "During the above steps (4.4; 4.5), make enough blocking buffer (10% Goat Serum and 0.1% Triton-X100 in PBS) for the entire experiment (number of sections x 100 µl x 3 steps).\nNote: Use serum from the same species in which the secondary Ab (conjugated to biotin) was made.\nPrevent non-specific binding of the antibody, by incubating sections in blocking buffer (100 µl/section) for 1 hr at room temperature (RT) with gentle agitation.\nIncubate sections in primary Ab (pERK) diluted in blocking buffer, overnight at 4 °C, with gentle agitation.\nWash sections in 0.1 M PBS with gentle agitation (3 x 5 min).\nIncubate with the secondary Ab conjugated with biotin (1:250) diluted in blocking buffer (same as used in step 4.6) for 1 hr at RT with gentle agitation.\nPrepare ABC reagent at the same time, because Avidin and biotin require at least 30 min at room temperature to complex.\nPrepare the required volume of ABC reagent according to manufacturers’ protocol.\nWash sections in 0.1 M PBS with gentle agitation (3 x 5 min).\nIncubate sections for 45 min at RT with ABC Reagent.\nWash sections in 0.1 M PBS with gentle agitation (3 x 5 min).\nPrepare DAB working solution, every step involving DAB must be done in the fume hood as DAB is carcinogenic and teratogenic.\nTransfer DAB solution to a new plate by plastic transfer pipette.\nPlace sections in the plate containing DAB working solution and slowly swirl plate by hand, to allow maximum exposure to sections.\nMonitor DAB reaction on microscope until adequate signal develops (2-5 min).\nStop the reaction at the desired color intensity by washing the tissue in 0.1 M PBS (3 x 5 min).",
    "Use bleach to deactivate any remaining DAB substrate solution in the fume hood overnight and dispose of it according to laboratory guidelines.\nMount sections on gelatin coated slides by floating in PBS. Then dry them at room temperature at least 3-4 hr.\nDehydrate the sections sequentially in 50%, 70%, 95% and 100% ethanol for 2 min each, and clear in 100% xylene for 5 min.\nCoverslip using mounting medium and leave in fume hood to dry overnight.\n5. Cell Count\nCount pERK-positive cells, three to five sections at the level of the dorsal hippocampus should be analyzed per animal.\nAcquire multiple bright-field images from each section at 200X magnification using an appropriate microscope, and then assemble them using an image processing software.\nPerform cell counts on tiff-converted mosaic images using the ImageJ free software.\nCount pERK-stained cells in the hilus and granule cell layer over two to three counting boxes of 100 × 100 µm each.\nCell densities will be expressed as the number of labeled cells per counting window (100 × 100 µm).\nPerform statistical analysis to assess significant difference between genotypes. This can be accomplished with Student's t test or ANOVA followed by appropriate post hoc test using commercial softwares. Set statistical significance level at p <0.05.\nSubscription Required.
