    "1. Preparation of Materials for Hydrogel Formation\nSynthesize pendant (Pep1Alloc, AF488Pep1Alloc) and crosslinking peptides (Pep2Alloc) by standard solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) techniques and thiol-functionalized polymer by three-step procedure for end group modification (PEG4SH).14,16 Alternatively, purchase PEG4SH (Mn ~ 20 kDa), Pep1Alloc, and Pep2Alloc commercially.\nSynthesize the photoinitiator (LAP) by the two-step reaction described below.14,17 Perform synthesis steps (1.2.1-1.2.11) in a fume hood and use caution when handling chemicals (wear protective gloves, clothing, and eyewear). LAP also may be purchased commercially.\n\t\nDry all glassware in oven (>2 hr, 80 °C).\nAdd a stir bar to an empty single-neck round-bottom flask (100 ml) and cover with a septum.\nSecure the flask on top of a magnetic stirring hot plate with a ring stand and clamp.\nInsert a needle (18 G) through the septum and leave the outer end open to the atmosphere. Insert a second needle attached to an inert gas line. Open the inert gas line (e.g., argon or nitrogen) and purge the flask for 10-15 min.\n\t\tNOTE: The system will be continuously purged with inert gas, argon or nitrogen, throughout the reaction.\nTransfer 1.5 g (~1.4 ml) dimethyl phenylphosphonite (CAUTION) to the flask, using a syringe with needle to pierce through the septum. Turn on the stir plate (medium speed) and be careful that the contents do not splash onto the sides of the flask.\nAdd 1.6 g (~1.46 ml) 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl chloride (CAUTION) dropwise to the flask containing dimethyl phenylphosphonite, using a syringe with a needle to pierce the septum.\nCover the reaction vessel with foil to protect from light and stir for 18 hr under argon or nitrogen.",
    "The next day, raise the height of the flask, place an oil bath on the stirrer, and carefully lower the flask into the oil bath. Heat the bath and the flask to 50 °C while maintaining magnetic stirring.\nDissolve 3.05 g lithium bromide in 50 ml of 2-butanone. Raise the flask out of the oil bath and add the lithium bromide solution to the round-bottom flask, briefly removing the septum to pour into the flask.\n\t\t\nSeal the flask again with the septum (CAUTION: Septum will still have a needle leading to the argon lines and a needle to vent), lower the flask back into heated oil bath, and allow the reaction to proceed for 10 min. A solid precipitate will form.\nAfter 10 min, turn off argon, remove the flask from heat, and allow the mixture to rest for 4 hr (covered with foil to protect from light as a light-sensitive initiator has been produced. Keep the vent needle place.\nPour product into a glass frit funnel or funnel lined with appropriate filter paper. Rinse filtrate 3 times with 50 ml of 2-butanone to remove any unreacted lithium bromide.\nDry (first on benchtop and then in vacuum desiccator) and analyze product by 1H NMR in D2O. Characteristic peaks at 1.8-1.9 (6H, s), 2.1-2.2 (3H, s), 6.7-6.8 (2H, s), 7.3-7.4 (2H, m), 7.4-7.5 (1H, m), and 7.5-7.7 (2H, m).14,17",
    "Use a spreadsheet to calculate the volume and concentration of each stock solution (PEG4SH, Pep1Alloc, Pep2Alloc, LAP) that must be prepared to make hydrogels (Table 1). To make non-patterned gels, ensure that [SH] = [Alloc] so that all reactive groups are consumed during polymerization. If photopatterning of gels is planned, include an excess amount of thiol functional groups during gel formation based on stoichiometry (e.g., 0.2-5 mM, [SH] >[Alloc]) for later reaction with Pep1Alloc.\n\tNOTE: Gels should contain greater than 5 weight percent (wt%) PEG4SH to ensure rapid polymerization (within 5 min). However, lower wt% ranges may be explored if the application calls for hydrogels with lower moduli (e.g., <0.5 kPa); polymerization should be checked and adjusted accordingly for these low wt% compositions. Similarly, Pep1Alloc concentration may be adjusted for different applications (e.g., 0.2-5 mM) as reported in literature for thiol-functionalized peptides.18-21 LAP concentration is recommended around 0.067 wt% (2.2 mM) or less, as described, as higher concentrations can decrease cell viability.\nPrepare stock solutions of Pep1Alloc, Pep2Alloc, PEG4SH, and LAP under sterile conditions for cell culture based on calculations in Table 1.\n\t\nFor Pep1Alloc and Pep2Alloc, individually weigh the total mass of Pep1Alloc and Pep2Alloc from the peptide synthesis and dissolve in sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin (PS) and 0.5 µg/ml fungizone (FZ). Typical concentrations of prepared stock solutions range from 20-100 mg/ml of peptide. Mix these stocks to achieve gels with final moduli relevant for soft tissue applications (Young's modulus ~ 0.5-5 kPa).22,23 Aliquot and store at -20 °C until use.\nFor PEG4SH, weigh PEG4SH into a sterile microcentrifuge tube and dissolve in PBS+PS+FZ. Typical concentrations of this stock solution range from 250-430 mg/ml (20-30% PEG4SH by weight).",
    "For LAP, weigh LAP into a sterile microcentrifuge tube and dissolve in PBS+PS+FZ to a final concentration of 7.5 mg/ml.\n\t\tNOTE: Preparing fresh solutions of PEG4SH and LAP is recommended for every encapsulation or gel experiment to ensure consistent polymerization times.\nPrepare Sterile Syringe Tip Molds for Forming Hydrogels.\n\t\nCarefully cut the tips off of 1 ml syringes using a razor blade and subsequently remove the plungers from the syringe shafts.\nSubmerge the syringe shafts and plungers in 70% ethanol for 15 min and place in a sterile cell culture hood to dry (30 min). If excess drops of ethanol remain inside syringe shaft, use the plunger to push them out.\nPrepare Sterile Glass Slide Molds for Forming Hydrogels.\n\t\nSoak glass slides (multiples of 2) and rubber gaskets (0.254 mm thick; 2 small pieces used as shims, a rectangle with discs punched out, or square frame shape) in 70% ethanol for 15 min, and place in sterile cell culture hood to dry.\nCoat half of the sterilized slides with anti-adhesive coating per manufacturer's directions to prevent adhesion of the top of the gel to the slide surface (e.g., if there are 4 slides, 2 slides will be coated with anti-adhesive). These will serve as the top of the glass slide mold.\nCalibrate the lamp for syringe or glass slide molds.\n\tNOTE: For these experiments, a mercury arc lamp with an external filter adaptor assembly and 365 nm external filter was used. Other lamps that produce appropriate intensities of long wavelength UV light may be used as reported by others.24-27",
    "Attach a collimating lens to the end of the liquid-filled light guide to ensure relatively even light intensity across all samples. As needed, adjust the distance of the light guide from the sample(s) to achieve a spot size that will cover samples of interest.\nPlace a cut syringe mold in a microcentrifuge tube holder (to hold syringe mold in vertical position). Hold the radiometer at the height of the syringe tip where the samples will be held and adjust shutter (% open) to achieve a light intensity of 10 mW/cm2 at 365 nm. Record the adjusted settings for later use.\nPlace a glass slide mold onto the top of a sterile surface (e.g., the top of a pipette tip box within a biosafety cabinet). Hold the radiometer detector at the height of the glass slide mold and adjust shutter (% open) to achieve a light intensity of 10 mW/cm2 at 365 nm. Record the adjusted settings for later use.\n2. Hydrogel Formation and Photopatterning\nPreparation of Non-patterned Hydrogels.\n\tNOTE: At this point in the protocol, if hydrogels are to be used in cell culture applications, all subsequent steps should be performed under sterile conditions in a sterile cabinet or hood.\n\t\nMix stock solutions of PEG4SH, Pep2Alloc, Pep1Alloc, LAP, and PBS+PS+FZ according to the spreadsheet calculation (see Table 1 example). Pipette the resulting gel precursor solution vigorously to ensure even mixing of the solution.\nPrepare thick hydrogels molded in syringe tips by pipetting 10-20 µl of the gel precursor solution (PEG/Pep/LAP/PBS) into the tip of a sterile, cut syringe. Make a single gel per syringe, approximately 0.5-1.5 mm thick based on volume and syringe diameter.",
    "NOTE: Larger volumes may be explored based on the desired gel size where upper limits may exist based on diffusional limitations for Pep1Alloc during photopatterning and/or nutrients/wastes to/from encapsulated cells during cell culture.\nPrepare thin hydrogels in glass slide molds by placing the rubber gasket (0.254-mm thick) around the edges of the non-coated glass slide. Pipette 5-10 µl gel precursor solution (single or multiple 5-10 µl gels may be made by pipetting one or more dots of solution onto a single slide) onto the non-coated glass slide and place the glass slide coated with anti-adhesive on top of the gel solution (larger gels, up to the size of the glass slide, may be made depending on the final application). Secure the glass slides with small binder clips to stabilize.\nPlace molds under the lamp and set the lamp intensity (e.g., % shutter open) to achieve 10 mW/cm2 at the gel surface for syringe tip molds or glass slide molds based on measurements in step 1.7.2 and 1.7.3, respectively.\nApply light for 1 to 5 min to allow complete polymerization of gels. Use a shorter polymerization time for gels with higher PEG4SH content (8 wt% or greater, 1 min) and longer for gels with lower PEG4SH content (5-8 wt%, 3-5 min) to produce fully-polymerized hydrogels with moduli within the range of soft tissues (0.5-5 kPa).\nPlace gels from syringe tip molds into a sterile non-treated 48-well plate, and place glass slides into a sterile dish.\nRinse 3 x 15 min with cell culture medium or appropriate buffer (e.g., PBS+PS+FZ, Ellman's reaction buffer) based on planned experiments, as detailed below.\nPreparation of Patterned Hydrogels.",
    "Mix stock solutions of PEG4SH, Pep2Alloc, LAP, and PBS+PS+FZ according to the spreadsheet calculation, leaving free thiols (0.2-5 mM) for later reaction with Pep1Alloc. Pipette the precursor solution vigorously to ensure even mixing of the solution.\nPrepare thick and thin hydrogels as laid out in steps 2.1.2 to 2.1.6.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not place gels in growth medium prior to photopatterning. Free thiols may be consumed by species in the growth medium (e.g., disulfide formation with thiol-containing proteins) and will not allow patterning of the gel without additional processing steps (e.g., reduction of disulfide bonds).\nPrepare solutions of Pep1Alloc (final concentration ~3-20 mg/ml) and 2.2 mM LAP.\nCover pre-formed gels with Pep1Alloc/LAP solution and incubate for 1 hr at 37 °C.\nRemove excess Pep1Alloc/LAP solution. If gels were molded in a syringe tip, use a spatula to carefully transfer the gels from the 48-well plate in which they are incubating to a sterile glass slide for patterning.\nPlace a photomask with the desired pattern directly on top of syringe- and glass slide-molded gels. Ensure that the printed part of the mask touches the gel for optimal pattern fidelity (i.e., mask should read right and be emulsion side down). Place samples under the lamp and irradiate for 1 min with the lamp settings used for glass slides (step 1.7.3).\nAfter patterning, place syringe-molded gels into a sterile, 48-well non-tissue culture treated plate, and place glass slide-molded gels that are adhered to the glass slides into a sterile dish.\nRinse 3 x 15 min with cell culture medium or appropriate buffer (e.g., PBS+PS+FZ, Ellman's reaction buffer) based on planned experiments.\n3. Visualizing and Quantification of Photopatterning\nEllman's Assay to Detect and Quantify Free Thiols in Photopatterned Hydrogels.\n\t\nPrepare Ellman's reaction buffer, cysteine working solution, standards, and Ellman's reagent as described below.",
    "For Ellman's Reaction Buffer, dissolve 2.4 g sodium phosphate dibasic (Na2HPO4) and 74.4 mg ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in 200 ml dIH2O (0.1 M Na2HPO4, 1 mM EDTA). Adjust the pH to 7.5-8 with solutions of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or phosphoric acid (H3PO4).\nFor Cysteine Working Solution, dissolve 5.27 mg cysteine in 15 ml reaction buffer (2 mM cysteine).\nFor Cysteine Standards, dilute cysteine working solution in reaction buffer to a final concentration of 2, 1.5, 1.25, 1, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25, and 0 mM cysteine.\nFor Ellman's Reagent, dissolve 4 mg Ellman's reagent in 1 ml reaction buffer. Sonicate to completely dissolve the Ellman's reagent.\nQuantify the concentration of free thiols in gels with Ellman's assay (Figure 2).\n\t\tNOTE: 'Thin' 5 µl hydrogels, molded between glass slides, are described in the procedure below and recommended to allow rapid diffusion of Ellman's reagent through the gel (i.e., it takes the reagent a longer time to diffuse through thick gels).\n\t\t\nDetermine the swollen gel volume of 'thin' 5 µl gels (VS) based on the volumetric swelling ratio, Q.\n\t\t\t\nMake three 20 µl 'thick' gels using syringe molds. Place gels in Ellman's reaction buffer for 24 hr and subsequently weigh (equilibrium swollen mass, MS). Lyophilize the gels and subsequently weigh (dry mass, MD).\nUsing the measured masses for thick gels, calculate the volumetric swelling ratio28 by Q = 1 + ρpolymer/ρsolvent(MS/MD-1) where ρpolymer = 1.07 g/cm3 for PEG,29 ρsolvent = 1.0 g/cm3 for PBS/H2O.",
    "Calculate the theoretical dry mass of the gel to be used for Ellman's Assay (here, 5 µl 'thin' gels are typically used), by summing the masses of individual components PEG4SH, Pep1Alloc, and Pep2Alloc (MD = MPEG4SH + MPep1Alloc + MPep2Alloc). For example, a 5 µl gel containing 10 wt% PEG4SH contains approximately 0.000535 g PEG as calculated by MPEG4SH = 0.005 cm3 x 1.07 g/cm3 x 0.10. Pep1Alloc and Pep2Alloc masses can be calculated in a similar manner based on wt% in solution (see the spreadsheet for values), assuming ρ ≈ 1.0 g/cm3 for these aqueous solutions.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: Gels also may be dried and weighed instead of calculating the theoretical dry mass. However, it may be challenging to consistently measure the dry mass of the thin, 5 µl gels.\nBased on the predicted dry mass and the Q value determined from 'thick' gels, calculate the predicted swollen mass MS for the 'thin' gel (equation in step 3.1.2.1.1). Assume that ρ ≈ 1.0 g/cm3, then MS ≈ VS. Use this calculated VS to perform quantitative Ellman's assay.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: The above method is recommended to determine Vs for swollen gels as the 'thin' 5 µl gels are difficult to transfer for weighing.\nForm thin hydrogels for patterning as described in section 2.2 (5 µl volume). Specifically, make gels with excess free thiols and 'pattern' half of these samples with Pep1Alloc using a clear coverslip to flood expose the entire gel with light (e.g., 6 total gels with excess thiol: 3 unmodified non-'patterned' and 3 'patterned').",
    "NOTE: For this assay, 'patterned' gels are flood exposed to light without a photomask. This method is used to determine the total number of free thiols consumed in the entire gel sample and to demonstrate how efficiently free thiols may be modified with peptide. From this information, the number of free thiols consumed during patterning with a photomask may be predicted based on the gel thickness and pattern area (regions exposed to light).\nPlace 'patterned' and non-'patterned' gels in wells of a 48-well plate and rinse 3 x 15 min with Ellman's reaction buffer to allow diffusion of unreacted species out of the gel and equilibrium swelling to occur.\nAdd extra Ellman's reaction buffer to the rinsed gels so that Vs with reaction buffer is a multiple of 20 µl. For example, if the predicted VS is 15 µl, add 5 µl reaction buffer (20 µl), and if the predicted VS is 30 µl, add 10 µl reaction buffer (40 µl).\nPipette the cysteine standards into individual wells (not containing gels) of a 96-well plate in multiples of 20 µl depending on the volume used in the previous step (i.e., if the previous step had VS + extra reaction buffer = 40 µl, add 40 µl of each standard to individual empty wells).\nDilute Ellman's reagent in reaction buffer (multiples of 180 µl reaction buffer + 3.6 µl Ellman's reagent; e.g., 183.6 for 20 µl or 367.2 µl for 40 µl in step 3.1.2.5).\nAdd diluted Ellman's reagent to wells containing standards and samples. For 20 µl samples, add 183.6 µl solution to each well. Double this amount of diluted Ellman's reagent for 40 µl samples (or scale accordingly based on the size of the sample).",
    "Incubate or place on a shaker for 1 hr and 30 min (at room temperature) or until the color of the solution matches the color of the gels by visual inspection to ensure sufficient diffusion of the yellow 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate dianion (TNB2-), which is generated upon reaction of Ellman's reagent with free thiols, from the gel.\nTake 100 µl of solution from samples and standards and place into wells of a 96-well plate.\nRead absorbance at 405 nm on a plate reader.\nTo process the data, plot the standard curve (samples from step 3.1.1.3) (absorbance versus concentration) and fit a linear function. Using the linear function, the concentration of free thiols in the 'diluted gel' solution (gel + reaction buffer) may be calculated based on absorbance readings. Finally, taking into account the 'dilution' with reaction buffer, determine the free thiol concentration in the gels without reaction buffer. (e.g., if 15 µl gel was diluted with 5 µl reaction buffer, multiply by 20/15).\nVisualization of photopatterns with Ellman's reagent (Figure 3A).\n\t\t\nSoak thin hydrogels patterned with Pep1Alloc in Ellman's reaction buffer for 1 hr.\nRemove excess reaction buffer by gently wiping around the edges of the hydrogel with a tissue.\nPipette Ellman's reagent directly on the surface of the gel. Immediately image on a light microscope at 10X or stereomicroscope with a color camera.\n\t\t\tNote: Gels must be imaged immediately because visualization patterns will dissipate within 5 min as the yellow TNB2- ion produced by cleavage of Ellman's reagent upon reaction with thiols in non-patterned region diffuses throughout the gel. Non-patterned regions appear faintly yellow to the naked eye; for better resolution and smaller patterns, magnification (e.g., use of a microscope) is required.\nVisualization of Photopatterns with Fluorescent Peptides (Figure 3B).",
    "For visualizing patterns with higher resolution or in three-dimensions, photopattern an AF488-modified Pep1Alloc (or similar fluorescent peptide) to the gels in step 2.2.\nImage on a fluorescent microscope. A confocal microscope may be used here to take z-stack images of the gel so that the pattern may be observed in the x-, y-, and z-planes.\n\t\tNOTE: With fluorescence, gels must be protected from light to ensure the stability of the AF488 fluorophore and maximum fluorescence. Gels do not need to be immediately imaged since the fluorescent peptide is fairly stable if protected from light (store in a container wrapped in foil at 4 °C).\n4. Cell Encapsulation in Hydrogels and Photopatterning\nCollecting and Preparing Cells for Encapsulation.\n\t\nFollowing standard sterile mammalian cell culture procedures, trypsinize and collect cells of interest from plates. Quench the trypsin with growth medium after detachment occurs (e.g., for a T-75 flask, 5 ml trypsin, quench with 5 ml medium, rinse plate with 5 ml medium for total 15 ml).\n\t\tNOTE: Trypsinization times can vary between cell types but typically occur between 5 and 15 min. Alternate cell detachment agents (e.g., Versene) may be used to collect cells if desired.\nCount cells (a minimum of 100 or per manufacturer's protocol) from aliquots of the trypsinized cell suspension using a hemocytometer or other cell counting device while centrifuging the bulk cell suspension (90-110 x g, 5 min). Re-suspend cell pellet after centrifugation in a minimal volume of PBS or growth medium and re-count if the initial trypsinized cell suspension is too dilute.\nRe-suspend cells in a minimal volume of PBS and aliquot portions for each gel condition into microcentrifuge tubes so that there will be 5,000 cells/µl when mixed with the gel solution (prior to polymerization).",
    "NOTE: Typical cell aliquots contain 300,000-500,000 cells and are enough to make 60-100 µl of gel/cell suspension which can be used for 3-5 x 20 µl gels with 5,000 cells/µl. Higher or lower cell densities may be used for encapsulation, depending on the amount of cell-cell vs. cell-matrix contact desired, respectively, and should be determined for each application.\nCentrifuge cell/PBS aliquots (90-110 x g, 5 min).\nCarefully aspirate PBS from cell pellet in microcentrifuge tube right before encapsulation.\n\t\tNOTE: If cells are sensitive to shear forces, the second centrifugation step may be eliminated by counting (e.g., hemocytometer) and subsequently aliquotting the trypsinized cell suspension (trypsin + media + cells) into portions needed for each gel condition. These aliquots are centrifuged once (90-110 x g, 5 min) and the trypsin + media is aspirated off, leaving a cell pellet for encapsulation.\nEncapsulating Cells in Non-patterned Hydrogels.\n\t\nImmediately after aspirating PBS, suspend pelleted cells in PEG4SH, Pep2Alloc, Pep1Alloc, LAP, and PBS+PS+FZ as calculated in the spreadsheet to a final concentration of 5,000 cells/µl.\nMold and polymerize hydrogels as described in steps 2.1.2 to 2.1.6.\n\t\tNOTE: When encapsulating cells in glass slide molds, care must be taken when removing the top slide post-polymerization to prevent shearing the gel, which can result in cell death. To help with removal of the gel from the mold, slide molds may be placed in sterile PBS or growth medium after polymerization to wet the gasket and hydrogel, making it easier to remove the top slide. A method to prevent this shear altogether is through the use of syringe molds.\nRinse gels 3 x 10 min in growth medium to remove unreacted species and excess LAP.",
    "Incubate gels in growth medium at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until the desired time point for further analysis. Replenish medium every 48 hr or as determined for the application (e.g., typical feeding interval for specific cell type and medium).\nEncapsulating Cells and Photopatterning in the Presence of Cells.\n\t\nImmediately after aspirating PBS, suspend pelleted cells in PEG4SH, Pep2Alloc, LAP, and PBS+PS+FZ as calculated in the spreadsheet to a final concentration of 5,000 cells/µl. Leave an appropriate concentration of free thiols (e.g., 2 mM) for later reaction with Pep1Alloc.\nMold, polymerize, and pattern hydrogels as described in steps 2.2.2 to 2.2.8.\nRinse gels 3 x 10 min in growth medium after patterning to remove unreacted species and excess LAP.\nIncubate gels in growth medium at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until the desired time point for further analysis. Replenish medium every 48 hr or as determined for the application.\n5. Determining the Viability and Metabolic Activity of Encapsulated Cells\nPerform Live/Dead Cytotoxicity Assay to Determine Encapsulated Cell Viability (Figure 4A).\n\t\nRemove growth medium from gels and rinse 3 x 15 min with PBS to allow diffusion of medium from gels.\nThaw live/dead cytotoxicity assay solutions (ethidium homodimer-1 and calcein AM).\nAdd 2 µl of the 2 mM ethidium homodimer-1 and 0.5 µl of the 4 mM calcein AM solutions to 1 ml sterile PBS. Vortex to ensure complete mixing.\nAdd 300 µl staining solution to each syringe mold gel in 48-well plates, or enough to cover the surface of gel on a glass slide in a sterile dish, and incubate for 45 min.\nRemove excess staining solution and rinse to remove excess dye from the gels (3 x 15 min with PBS).",
    "Image on a confocal microscope (z-stack images) or on an epi-fluorescence microscope with z-stack capability at 10X and 488/525 nm Ex/Em. Quantify the number of viable cells by projecting the z-stacks and counting the number of live (green throughout cell body) and dead (red nuclei) cells with imaging software.\nPerform metabolic activity assay to determine cell activity post-encapsulation (Figure 4B).\n\t\n24 hr prior to assay, feed encapsulated cells with fresh growth medium.\n\t\tNOTE: Add medium to a few extra wells (containing no gels or gels with no cells) as control (background readings).\nAt the time point of interest, thaw MTS reagent solution.\n\t\tNOTE: In order to determine metabolic activity over time, an initial time point (12-24 hr post-encapsulation) is recommended as a reference for comparison to later time points.\nAdd MTS reagent to each well (20 µl per 100 µl growth medium).\nIncubate samples for 1-4 hr at 37 °C and 5% CO2, per manufacturer's instructions.\n\t\tNOTE: Incubation times should be sufficient for cells to reduce MTS and allow diffusion of the formazan product out of the gel. Consequently, thicker gels such as syringe tip gels may require longer incubation times (~4 hr) for sufficient MTS reduction and diffusion.\nPipette 100 µl reduced MTS/Medium into clean wells of a 96-well plate and record absorbance at 490 nm on a plate reader.\nSubtract the background absorbance for wells without cells from sample absorbance values to generate baselined absorbance values."
