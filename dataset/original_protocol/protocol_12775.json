    "1. Design of STAgR Cloning Strategy\nDecide on how many gRNA cassettes will be included in one expression vector and in which order. Determine which promoters and gRNA scaffolds should be used for each of the gRNAs. Design the gRNAs by using any online tool (e.g., www.benchling.com).\n2. Design of STAgR Cloning Primers with Overhangs\nNOTE: The sense protospacer sequence of the last gRNA and the antisense of the first gRNA respectively are added to the PCR primers used for amplification of the vector backbone (Figure 1). The remaining sequences are amplified from the strings, thereby attaching the sense and antisense gRNAs in the desired order. The first string piece is amplified with a forward primer containing the first gRNA N20 sequence as an overhang and a reverse primer with the second gRNA N20 sequence (reverse complement) as an overhang. All the following pieces are generated accordingly.\nAdd N20 gRNA sequences to the forward amplification primers for STAgR DNA string as overhangs (Table 1). Add sense gRNA sequences 5' to the forward primer \"scf-FP\" (for a conventional scaffold) or \"sam-FP\" (for a MS2 containing scaffold). FP primers anneal to the scaffold/MS2 part of the respective STAgR string (Figure 1).\nAdd the reverse complement N20 gRNA sequence to the reverse primer sequences. Choose RP primers depending on the specific promoters and strings used (hU6-RP, mU6-RP, 7sK-RP, H1-RP).\n3. Generation of STAgR Cloning Fragments\nTo generate the individual cloning fragments for Gibson assembly, perform PCRs by setting up 10 µL of high fidelity (HF) buffer, 1 µL of 10 mM dNTPs, 0.25 µL of overhang-primer (100 µM), 10 ng of the DNA template (string or vector), 0.5 µL HF polymerase, 1.5 µL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and add H2O to make a final volume of 50 µL.",
    "NOTE: Use the plasmid \"STAgR_Neo\" as a template for the backbone PCR to incorporate the gRNA scaffold to the last gRNA, if the SAM Scaffold is chosen, use \"STAgR_SAM\". For a STAgR plasmid with six gRNA cassettes for example, six PCRs are necessary, five with DNA strings as templates and one with the vector backbone as the template.\nIncubate reactions on a thermocycler using the following conditions: 1 cycle of 98 °C for 1 min 30 s; 38 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 59 °C (for gRNA scaffold)/ 68 °C (for SAM loop) for 10 s, 72 °C for 30 s (for inserts) / 1 min 30 s (for vectors); 1 cycle of 72 °C for 10 min.\nRemove 5.5 µL from the PCR reaction, add loading dye and analyze the amplified fragments on a 1% agarose gel. Load an appropriate DNA ladder for sizing (100 bp DNA ladder/1 kb DNA ladder) and run the gel in an appropriate gel running buffer (e.g., TLE buffer) at 120 V for 30 min.\nWhile the gel is running, add 5 µL of the buffer provided with the restriction enzyme and 0.5 µL DpnI (10 units) to the remaining 44.5 µL PCR reaction and incubate for 30 min to 1 h at 37 °C.\nPerform DNA purification using magnetic beads.\n\t\nAdd 1.8 µL magnetic beads per 1 µL of PCR product and mix by pipetting up and down.Incubate for 2 min at room temperature (RT).\nSeparate beads and DNA fragments from residual liquid with a magnet. Wash beads twice with 70% ethanol by rinsing the pellet without resuspending completely.\nRemove all ethanol with a pipette and let the pellet air dry.",
    "Dissolve the pellet in 15–20 µL H2O by pipetting up and down and separate the beads from the liquid by using a magnet. Transfer the clear supernatant to a new tube.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, column-based reaction clean-up kits can be used.\nDetermine DNA concentrations using a spectrophotometer as described elsewhere29.\n4. Gibson Assembly Reaction and Bacterial Transformation\nNOTE: The following steps are adapted from Gibson et al.30.\nPrepare a homemade Gibson reaction mix or use a commercial Gibson cloning kit.\n\t\nCombine 3 mL of 1 M Tris (Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane)-HCl at pH 7.5, 300 µL of 1 M MgCl, 60 µL of 100 mM dGTP (deoxyguanosine triphosphate), 60 µL of 100 mM dATP (deoxyadenosine triphosphate), 60 µL of 100 mM dTTP (deoxythymidine triphosphate), 60 µL of 100 mM dCTP (deoxycytidine triphosphate), 300 µL of 1 M DTT (dithiothreitol), 1.5 g of PEG-8000 (polyethylene glycol), 300 µL of 100 mM NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and add H2O to obtain 6 mL of 5× isothermal reaction buffer.\n\t\tNOTE: Aliquoted buffer can be stored at -20 °C for at least 12 months.\nFor the Gibson assembly master mix, combine 320 µL of 5x isothermal reaction buffer with 697 µL of H2O and add 3 µL of 10 U/µL T5 exonuclease, 20 µL of 2 U/µL DNA polymerase and 160 µL of 40 U/µL Taq DNA ligase.\n\t\tNOTE: This mix can be aliquoted and stored at -20 °C for at least 12 months.\nUse 7.5 µL of assembly master mix with 2.5 µL of insert and vector. For a 2x STAgR reaction use a molar vector to insert ratio of 1:1 but not more than 0.2 pmol of DNA in total. For more than 2 gRNA expression cassettes, use a vector to insert ratio of 1:3 but do not exceed a total DNA amount of 0.5 pmol.",
    "NOTE: All amplified gRNA expression cassettes should be used in equimolar amounts. Include a plasmid control with the identical amount of vector but no inserts to control for undigested template vector (and/or self-ligation).\nIncubate samples at 50 °C for 45 to 60 min. Store samples on ice or at -20 °C for subsequent transformation.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\nDirectly transform half of the mix into chemically competent bacteria.\n\t\nThaw chemically competent TOP10 E. coli bacteria on ice.\nAdd 5 µL of the Gibson mix to 50 µL of competent bacteria. Gently mix by flicking the bottom of the tube. Incubate on ice for 30 min.\nPerform a heat shock by placing the tube in a 42 °C water bath or a heat block for 45 s.\nPut the tubes back on ice. Add 250 µL of SOC medium to the bacteria and let them recover at 37 °C in a shaking incubator for 30–45 min.\nAfter recovery, plate the transformed bacteria onto 1.5% lysogeny broth (LB) agar plates containing ampicillin (100 µg/ mL) and incubate overnight at 37 °C.\n5. Selecting STAgR Clones by Bacterial Colony PCR\nPrepare at least two sets of 200 µL PCR reaction tubes (between 3 and 24) for each construct, which are labeled identically.\nFill one set with 100 µL LB medium containing 100 µg/ mL ampicillin.\nUse a sterile pipette tip to scratch off the biological material of one bacterial colony and spread it at the bottom of the empty 100 µL PCR reaction tube. Immediately transfer the tip to the second corresponding reaction tube containing the LB medium.\nSwirl the tip around gently to ensure some of the bacteria are transferred to the LB media and incubate at 37 °C for later use.",
    "Set up a PCR master mix (10 µL per reaction).\n\t\nFor 10 reactions, combine 10 µL Taq buffer, 2 µL 10 mM dNTPs, 0.5 µL of primer (100 µM), 0.5 µL of Taq polymerase and add H2O to a volume of 100 µL.\nUse the following primers: StAgR_seq_fwd2: ACTGGATCCGGTACCAAGG, StAgR_seq_rev: TTACGGTTCCTGGCCTTTTG.\nAdd 10 µL of the PCR master mix to the labeled PCR reaction tubes without the LB media.\nIncubate reactions on a thermocycler using the following conditions: 1 cycle of 94 °C for 5 min, 38 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 2 min; 1 cycle of 72 °C for 10 min.\n\tNOTE: Elongation time (72 °C step) should be increased with the number of gRNA expression cassettes. Calculate theoretical size of inserts using Table 2 and use 1 min per 1 kb at 72 °C.\nAdd loading dye and analyze the amplified fragments on a 1% agarose gel. Load an appropriate DNA ladder for sizing (1kb DNA Ladder) and run the in appropriate gel running buffer (e.g., TLE Buffer) at 120 V for 30 min.\nCalculate the theoretical size of the amplicon with the help of Table 2 by adding up the individual sizes of used promoters, gRNA scaffolds and number of N20 sequences. From the results of the colony PCR, identify the bacterial clones based on the correct band size and whether they are likely to harbor correct vectors.\nInoculate a 2.5 mL overnight LB culture (with 100 µg/mL ampicillin) with the corresponding 100 µL culture, set up earlier. Incubate at 37 °C for 12 h.\nExtract plasmid DNA using a commercial plasmid mini kit and manufacturer's instructions31.\nSequence the plasmids using the following primers: StAgR_seq_fwd1 (GAGTTAGGGGCGGGACTATG), StAgR_seq_fwd2 (ACTGGATCCGGTACCAAGG) and StAgR_seq_rev (TTACGGTTCCTGGCCTTTTG) by Sanger Sequencing."
