We recommend observing cells under a microscope regularly to ensure that cells are not over-digested. A gentle tap on one side of the plate helps to agitate cells and improve the dissociation efficiency. Prolonged incubation of cells with enzymes may reduce cell viability.\nAfter incubation for 6 min, gently shake the plate and pipette the solution using a 1 mL pipette several times to fully dissociate the monolayer into single cells.\nCritical: hiPSC-CMs should be dissociated into single cells to ensure accurate cell count.\nTransfer the dissociated cell suspension into a 15 mL Falcon tube containing 8 mL of seeding medium.\nAdd 1 mL of seeding medium to the well and wash off the remaining cells from the well; then transfer the cell suspension to the Falcon tube to give a final volume of 10 mL.\nNote: If a large number of cells are required, multiple wells of hiPSC-CMs can be dissociated together and the cell suspension can be collected in a 50 mL Falcon tube.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 300 × g for 3 min at room temperature (22°C).\nAspirate the supernatant and re-suspend cells in 1 mL of 37°C pre-warmed seeding medium.",
    "Note: If multiple wells of hiPSC-CMs are dissociated, we recommend re-suspending the cell pellet according to the rule of 1 mL of seeding medium per well of 6-well plate.\nMix 20 μL of cell suspension with 1:1 Trypan blue in a 0.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nTransfer 15 μL of stained cell suspension in a Countess® Cell Counting Chamber Slide (each slide has a duplicate) and count cell number by the Luna-FL automated fluorescence cell counter. The cell suspension is ready for re-plating.\nSeeding cells for imaging\nTiming: 30 min (15 min every other day)\nRemove the coating Matrigel from each well/dish/customized chamber.\nAdjust the cell suspension to the density of 500,000 cells/mL in the seeding medium, transfer the cell suspension into a 10 mL reservoir, and add 100 μL of the cell suspension to each well of the 96-well plate.\nCritical: To re-plate cells in a 96-well plate, a multi-channel pipette should be used. To avoid cells from settling down at the bottom of the reservoir, we recommend pipetting up and down the cell suspension several times before re-plating.\nAdd 50 μL of cell suspension and 50 μL of seeding medium to each customized cell chamber on the coverslip for Ca2+ imaging.\nAdd 200 μL of cell suspension and 300 μL of seeding medium to each 35 mm glass-bottom dish for action potential measurement.\nAfter 24 h, aspirate the seeding medium.\nNote: We recommend putting a 1 mL non-filtered tip over the 2 mL aspiration pipette and ensure that the tip does not touch cells.\nAdd 100 μL of hiPSC-CM culture medium to each well in a 96-well plate or customized cell chamber. Replace the medium every other day until recording.",
    "Add 500 μL of the hiPSC-CM culture medium to 35 mm glass-bottom dishes. Replace the medium every other day until recording.\nAutomated recording of hiPSC-CM contraction motion\nTiming: 1 h/96-well plate\nTurn on the microscope, camera, CO2 supply, and heating unit 10 min before use and set the heating unit temperature to 37°C.\nAdd the desired amount of water to the water jacket of the plate holder (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1064-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Adjust the camera frame rate to 75 frames per second (fps) and the video/image format to 1024 × 1024 pixels (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). The total recording time is 10 s. Live-cell imaging is performed by an inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope (USA) equipped with a 10× objective (NA: 0.3).\nNote: To avoid the biased selection of a region of interest (ROI), the center of each well is imaged. During recording, ensure the vibration of the microscope table is minimal.\nOpen the Sony SI8000 cardiac analysis software; the motion detection and analyses are conducted automatically (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nNote: It is essential to detect contraction start, contraction peak, contraction end, relaxation peak, and relaxation end for each beating cycle to complete analyses.\nSingle-cell Ca2+ imaging\nTiming: 2–3 h\nPrepare Tyrode’s solution as described in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section.\nPrepare the Fura-2 AM loading solution as described in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section.",

    "Put the temperature sensor in the bath chamber.\nNote: Secure the sensor in place during the recording.\nSet the temperature controller at 37°C.\nConnect the field stimulation electrodes with a stimulator.\nSet the field stimulation at 0.5 Hz with a pulse duration of 20 ms.\nFura-2 AM loaded cells are excited with Lambda DG 4 ultra-high-speed wavelength switching light source (Sutter Instrument, USA) at both 340 and 380 nm at fast-switching mode and the emission fluorescence signals are collected at 510 nm with the iXon Ultra 897 EMCCD camera (Andor Technology, UK). Find a region of interest (ROI) under the eye pieces first and then switch to the live view by camera.\nNote: The light source switching mode can be set as indicated in the operation manual of Lambda DG 4. Ensure cells are focused under the live view by camera.\nClick “Run now” to start recording under the ND Acquisition mode in NIS Elements AR software (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). Exposure time for each wavelength is 20 ms and the total recording time is 20 s.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1064-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Changes in fluorescence intensity of individual hiPSC-CMs over time are recorded by the NIS Elements AR software, which permits the recording of multiple cells.",
    "After recording, using the ROI selection tool to select individual hiPSC-CM in ROI as well as an area without any cells for background subtraction (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nMeasure the fluorescence intensity using the time measurement function (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nExport the data to Excel for further analyses.\nAnalyze the data using an open-source Excel-based program as previously published (Greensmith, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nFluorescence-based single-cell action potential imaging\nTiming: 2–3 h\nThree days before imaging, prepare the lentivirus infection medium as described in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] and add 300 μL to each dish with the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of three.\nNote: Use the minimum required volume for infection to improve efficiency.\nAfter 24 h, aspirate the infection medium.\nAdd 500 μL of hiPSC-CM culture medium to each dish until imaging.\nOn the day of imaging, turn on the confocal microscope and incubation system.\nCritical: The incubation system is essential for live-cell imaging. The temperature of the imaging chamber is kept at 37°C and is humidified to avoid evaporation of solution during imaging.\nRemove the medium and wash cells twice with 1 mL of Tyrode’s solution.\nRemove the washing solution, add 1 mL of Tyrode’s solution to the dish, and place the dish onto a holding adapter to allow cells to stabilize for 5 min before imaging. Live-cell imaging is performed by an inverted Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope equipped with a 20× objective (NA: 0.8). The line-scan mode is used for measuring the action potential of single cells (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 5B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1064-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

    "(D) Example of single action potential trace (shown in the box in panel C) showing the measurement of amplitude and action potential duration (APD).\nCritical: It is essential to allow cells to adapt to Tyrode’s solution before imaging. Cells usually start to show changes in fluorescence (changes in membrane potential) within 1 min after switching to Tyrode’s solution based on our experience.\nLive cell imaging of single cells is conducted in a line scan mode with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and the emission is filtered with a band-pass filter (493–630 nm). The scanning line is selected across the cell membrane with the maximal scanning speed. The image size is 512 × 1 pixels with the total recording time of 8 s. The recording is conducted using the Zen software (USA) and images are saved as LSM files.\nFor analyses, line-scan images are opened in Image J (USA). The fluorescence intensity of images is inverted using the Invert function under the Edit in ImageJ. The entire image is selected (Ctrl+A) to plot the profile of images (Ctrl+Alt+K). The amplitude, action potential duration (APD) 30, 50, 70, and 90 can be determined accordingly (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C and 5D).\nNote: The cycle of scanning can be adjusted according to the experimental condition. If hiPSC-CMs beat slow, more recording time is required to allow recording multiple cycles of action potential."
