    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCritical: Use nuclease-free H2O (DEPC H2O, 1‰ diethyl pyrocarbonate in ddH2O, sterile) at all steps whenever H2O is needed in biochemical experiments.\nMetabolic labeling and isolation of cellular mRNA\nTiming: 17 h for step 1\nTiming: 2 h for step 2\nTiming: 1 h for step 3\nWe start from the metabolic labeling process by feeding human HeLa, HEK293T and mouse H2.35 cells with a methionine analog, Se-allyl-L-selenohomocysteine, which substitutes the methyl group on the enzyme cofactor S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) with allyl group. Accordingly, cellular RNAs are expected to be metabolically modified with a6A at the supposed m6A-forming sites which are manipulated by cellular methyltransferase. Then, we isolate mRNA from these metabolic labeled cells, which is prepared for further isolation by selective immunoprecipitation.\nHeLa, HEK293T, and mouse H2.35 cells have been used. HeLa and HEK293T cells are first cultured in DMEM/high-glucose medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% 100 × Penicillin/Streptomycin Solution at 37°C with 5% CO2 with a confluency of 80%.\nCell culture and metabolic labeling for HeLa, HEK293T, and mouse H2.35 cells\nDissolve Se-allyl-L-selenohomocysteine in sterile water to a final concentration of 50 mM.\nDissolve L-cysteine in sterile water to a final concentration of 100 mM.\nPrepare pretreating medium. The methionine-deficient medium (RPMI 1640, methionine-deficient) is supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% 100 × Penicillin/Streptomycin Solution, and L-cysteine at a final concentration of 1 mM.\nPrepare feeding medium. Add Se-allyl-L-selenohomocysteine prepared above into the pretreating medium to a final concentration of 1 mM.\nRemove the regular culture medium (complete DMEM medium) from cells, wash once with PBS, remove the PBS, and then add equal volume of pretreating medium for 30 min of incubation at 37°C. The purpose of this step is to deplete cellular and intracellular methionine.",
    "Remove the pretreating medium and add equal volume of feeding medium. The cells are further cultured at 37°C for another 16 h.\nNote: The plate size is determined by the mRNA needed. If 150 mm plate size is used, 20 mL pretreating medium and feeding medium will be added.\nIsolation of total RNA\nAfter metabolic labeling for 16 h, remove the feeding medium, wash once with cold PBS, remove the PBS, and then add 5 mL TRIzolTM Reagent to 150 mm culture dish to lyse the cells.\nIncubate the homogenized cell lysate of TRIzol at 20°C–30°C for 5 min, and transfer it to a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nAdd 1 mL of chloroform (1:5 of TRIzol) to the tube, shake the tube vigorously for 15 s, and incubate the mixture for 3 min at 20°C–30°C.\nCentrifuge at 12,000×g for 15 min at 4°C. The mixture is separated into three phases: a colorless upper aqueous, a white interphase, and a lower red phenol-chloroform phase.\nCarefully transfer the upper aqueous phase containing RNA to a new tube by angling the tube at 45° and pipetting the solution out.\nCritical: Avoid transferring any of the interphase or organic layer into the pipette when removing the aqueous phase.\nAdd an equal volume of isopropanol (about 3 mL) to the above aqueous solution, and mix thoroughly and incubate them on ice for 15 min. Centrifuge the mixture at 15,000×g for 15 min at 4°C to obtain total RNA precipitate, a white gel-like pellet, at the bottom of the tube.\nDiscard the supernatant but not disturb the pellet, wash once with 6 mL ice-cold 75% ethanol, and centrifuge at 15,000×g for 15 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant, and air dry the RNA pellet at 20°C–30°C for 5 min.",
    "Dissolve total RNA pellet in 260 μL RNase-free water, incubate at 60°C for 10 min, and 1 μL could be used to analyze with 1.5% agarose gel to confirm the RNA product.\nPause point: Total RNA can be stored at −80°C for one month at this point.\nIsolation of a6A-labeled mRNA\nUse GenElute™ mRNA Miniprep Kit to isolate mRNA from total RNA.\nNote: Preheat the Elution Solution at 70°C in a heating block.\nPipette 250 μL total RNA (200–300 μg) into RNase-free 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, add 250 μL of 2× Binding Solution, and vortex briefly to mix.\nAdd 20 μL of oligo(dT) beads and vortex thoroughly to mix the contents.\nNote: Increase volume to 25 μL of oligo(dT) when more than 300 μg total RNA is started.\nIncubate the mixture at 70°C for 3 min in a heating block to denature the RNA.\nRemove the sample from the heating block and allow it to stand at 20°C–30°C for 10 min.\nSpin at 16,000×g for 2 min at 20°C–30°C, carefully remove the supernatant, leaving approximately 50 μL to avoid disturbing the white pellet containing oligo(dT) beads/mRNA complex.\nResuspend the pellet in 500 μL Wash Solution, and use pipette to mix.\nPipet all of the suspension into a GenElute spin filter/collection tube assembly.\nSpin at 16,000×g for 2 min at 20°C–30°C, and discard the flow-through.\nPipet 500 μL Wash Solution onto the spin filter, and spin at 16,000×g for 2 min at 20°C–30°C.\nDiscard the flow-through and the original collection tube.\nTransfer the spin filter into a fresh collection tube, add 50 μL Elution Solution (70°C) into the center of the spin filter, and incubate for 5 min at 70°C.",
    "Spin at 16,000×g for 2 min at 20°C–30°C, and transfer the flow-through into a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube to collect polyadenylated RNA.\nAdd another 30 μL Elution Solution (70°C) into the center of the spin filter, incubate for 5 min at 70°C, and then spin at 16,000×g for 2 min at 20°C–30°C. Afterwards, transfer the flow-through into the same 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nPause point: The purified polyadenylated RNAs can be stored at −80°C for two weeks at this point.\nEnrichment of a6A-containing mRNA\nTiming: 14 h for step 4\nTiming: 10 min for step 5\nTiming: 14 h for step 6\nTiming: 10 h for step 7\nTiming: 14 h for step 8\nTo increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the result, a specific antibody is selected to enrich the metabolically labeled a6A-containing mRNAs. Isolated mRNA is fragmented into around 100–300 nt pieces, and an antibody which recognizes a6A instead of m6A and A, is applied to enrich a6A-containing fragments. Afterwards, a6A-containing mRNAs are eluted by competitive elution with a6ATP, and purified for the next step.\nCritical: We use a commercial antibody which targets N6-isopentenyladenosine (Cytokinin, Rabbit, IgG). Due to the geometrical similarity between isopentenyl and allyl, this antibody is also able to recognize a6A but not m6A or A (Shu et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nConcentrating a6A-labeled mRNA\nTransfer 200 μL mRNA (about 25 μg) products obtained from the above mRNA preparation kit into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, add 20 μL of 3 M sodium acetate solution (pH = 5.2), 220 μL of isopropanol, and no more than 2 μL glycogen. Then pipet to mix and incubate at −20°C about 12–16 h for precipitation.\nCentrifuge at 16,000×g for 45 min at 4°C.",
    "Discard the supernatant but not disturb the mRNA pellet, wash once with 440 μL 80% ethanol, and centrifuge at 16,000×g for 15 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant again, and air dry the mRNA pellet for 5 min at 20°C–30°C.\nDissolve mRNA with 36 μL RNase-free water to recover mRNA at a concentration of around 550 ng/μL.\nNote: The recovery yield from isopropanol precipitation is about 80%. Add RNase-free water if needed to adjust the concentration of mRNA to be around 500–600 ng/μL, which is the best RNA concentration for our fragmentation by ZnCl2. If the concentration is too high, there will be some larger size RNA remnants. If the concentration is too low, the size of fragments will be less than 150 bp.\nFragmentation of a6A-labeled mRNA\nAdd 4 μL 10 × fragmentation buffer to the above mRNA solution, pipet to mix, and incubate at 70°C for 7 min.\nAdd 8 μL 0.5 M EDTA solution (pH = 8.0) to stop the reaction, and adjust the volume of mixture into 100 uL by RNase-free water.\nPurification of mRNA fragments\nAdd 1/10 volume (10 μL) of 3 M sodium acetate solution (pH = 5.2), equal volume (110 μL) of isopropanol, and no more than 1 μL glycogen. Then pipet to mix and incubate for precipitation about 12–16 h at −20°C.\nCentrifuge at 16,000×g for 45 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant but not disturb the mRNA pellet, wash once with 220 μL 80% ethanol, and centrifuge at 16,000×g for 15 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant again, and air dry mRNA pellet for 5 min at 20°C–30°C.\nDissolve mRNA pellet with 100 μL RNase-free water, and 1 μL could be used to analyze with 1.5% agarose gel to confirm the size of RNA fragment.",
    "Pause point: Take out about 100 ng mRNA fragments to save as input for library construction at −80°C for one week. The rest are used for immunoprecipitation immediately or stored at −80°C for no longer than one week.\nNote: The following steps are performed for antibody-immunoprecipitation from 5 μg mRNA fragments. If a larger quantity is used, amplify the system proportionally. The procedures are performed according to the protocol of m6A-seq (Dominissini et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nAntibody enrichment of a6A-labeled mRNA fragments\nPrepare 1.5 mL low-binding microcentrifuge tube, and transfer 5 μg mRNA fragments into it.\nPrepare 5× IP buffer freshly before experiment and keep it on ice.\nMix the listed reagents as indicated below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1352_13.csv\nIncubate with head-over-tail rotation (10 rpm, crystalindustries TR-02U model) for 4 h at 4°C.\nPrepare another 1.5 mL low-binding microcentrifuge tube for ProteinA beads incubation.\nPrepare 1× IP buffer just before use.\nCritical: Keep it on ice.\nTransfer 40 μL ProteinA beads (Dynabeads™ Protein A for Immunoprecipitation) into the tube, and place the tube on a magnetic rack to separate beads from the supernatant.

    "In our previous work, we found that the iodination of N6-allyl group of a6A under alkaline conditions spontaneously induces the formation of 1, N6-cyclized adenosine (cycA), which generates base misincorporation at its opposite site during complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis via reverse transcription (Shu et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).

For the sample of IP-RNA, RevertAid RT enzyme is used in order to improve the overall read-through rate and thus enhance the a6A-IP peak calling.
