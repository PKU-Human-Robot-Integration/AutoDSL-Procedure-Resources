    "Extraction of mononuclear cells from donor Buffy CoatsSingle donor leukocyte buffy coats are obtained from the Blood Transfusion Centre in Belfast (NIBTS) or from volunteers following ethical approval (approx. 50 ml/blood bag/volunteer).Pre-warm all media (HBSS, 1% FBS RPMI and 10% FBS RPMI) in a water bath 1-2 h prior to isolation and pre-warm the centrifuge to 20 °C prior to isolation. Under a laminar flow cabinet decant the donor blood into a T75 flask and dilute (1:2) using sterile HBSS and mix by inversion.Pipette 15 ml of Ficoll-Paque into 4 x 50 ml Falcons.Very gently layer the diluted blood at a 45° angle onto the Ficoll, taking care not to mix the layers. Top up the remaining tube with HBSS to make a final volume of 50 ml.Centrifuge all tubes at 480 x g, 20 °C for 20 min without brake.After the spin, locate the pearlescent white layer (buffy layer, shown as lymphocytes, monocytes and platelets layer in Figure 1), which is sedimented through the plasma-density gradient interface. Extract into a new sterile 50 ml Falcon using a Pasteur pipette.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170426/20170426024431_5596.jpgFigure 1. Schematic diagram to illustrate monocyte isolation from peripheral blood. After blood has been layered onto the Ficoll and centrifuged as described above without brake, blood components are separated into layers. A Pasteur pipette is used to carefully remove the lymphocyte, monocyte and platelet layer to use in downstream processing.To wash the cells, add 40 ml of HBSS to the mononuclear cells and mix by inversion.Centrifuge again at 290 x g, 4 °C for 5 min with brake. Aspirate off supernatant slowly (take care as the pellet may become loose and add another 40 ml HBSS). Repeat this wash step 3 times.",
    "After the last wash, resuspend the pellet in 10 ml of complete 1% FBS RPMI and mix thoroughly by either vortexing or inversion.Place a cover slip on a haemocytometer and load 10 μl of the cell mixture via capillary action through the loading channel. Incubate in the 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for at least 5 min (see Note 1).After this time, view the cells under a microscope at 20x magnification. Count all mononuclear cells (see Note 1). Cells are then seeded at density of 1 x 106 cells/well of a 6 well plate using 3 ml complete 1% FBS RPMI (see Table 1 for other seeding densities). Incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for at least 2 h to ensure mononuclear cells have adhered to the plastic of the well. Table 1. MSC and MDM (1:20 ratio) seeding densitiestable:",

    "After this time non-adherent cells (lymphocytes) are washed off twice with HBSS (by adding 1 ml HBSS, slight agitation and then aspiration of waste). To promote monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM) maturation, replace complete 1% FBS RPMI with 3 ml complete RPMIGM-CSF (see Recipes).Leave cells to rest for 5-7 days at 37 °C, 5% CO2. After 5-7 days, wash cells twice with HBSS and replace with 3 ml complete 1% FBS RPMI. Leave cells to rest for 1 h prior to stimulation experiments. Human mesenchymal stromal cell cultureMSC expansion and storageMSC are shipped from Texas, US in liquid nitrogen in 1 ml cryovials at passage number 1 or 2 (P1-P2) meaning they have undergone at least one or two stages of cell splitting in culture. For experimental use (see section Preparing P3 MSC for Experimental Use) cells are only used from P3-P5.Shortly after arrival, defrost 1 vial and culture in pre-warmed 15 ml complete 16% FBS α-MEM in a T175 flask for less than 24 h. Retain the passage number by splitting cells less than 24 h later and expanding them using a density of 21,000 cells per flask. A P2 vial can undergo an additional expansion to be stored at P3. Store cells (1 million cells/vial) at either P2 or P3 in liquid nitrogen storage. Preparing P3 MSC for experimental use Once ready to use, defrost 1x P3 cryovial of MSC in the water bath (37 °C) and place entire 1 ml into 15-20 ml of complete 16% FBS α-MEM, making sure to feed every other day. Cells are maintained in culture until P5-P6.Direct co-culture of Human Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC and Monocyte-derived  Macrophages (MDM)Pre-warm DPBS, HBSS, complete 10% FBS RPMI, 1% FBS RPMI, 16.",
    "5% FBS α-MEM and 1% FBS α-MEM in the water bath at 37 °C for at least half an hour before the start of the experiment.Following work has to be completed in a biosafety cabinet with cabinet light switched off. At 70-80% confluency, to pre-stain MSC mitochondria, aspirate older 16% FBS α-MEM from the T175 flask and add 20 ml of staining solution (1% FBS α-MEMMITO [see Recipes and Note 2]), incubate for approximately 30 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2.For MSC being pre-treated with cytochalasin B, 20 ml of 1% FBS α-MEMCYTO is added to cells for 1-2 h at least prior to staining solution (1% FBS α-MEMMITO). As Cyto B is soluble in DMSO, make sure to have a control flask of cells for DMSO vehicle control.Aspirate 1% FBS α-MEMCYTO from the flask and replace with 1% FBS α-MEMMITO, and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2.After this time, the staining solution is aspirated from MSC and the cells are washed at least three times in 5 ml DPBS.Aspirate waste DPBS and add 7 ml 1x trypsin (diluted in DPBS) and leave in the incubator for approximately 2-5 min.Once the cells are suitably detached, add 7 ml of complete α-MEM to counteract trypsin action and pipette the cells into a 50 ml Falcon.Centrifuge the cells at 290 x g for 5 min.During this time, prepare the MDMs by aspirating older culture medium and washing twice with 1-2 ml of HBSS. Aspirate the remaining HBSS and leave the MDMs to rest in the incubator in 200 μl (chamber slide), 1 ml (24 well plate) or 3 ml (6 well plate) of 1% FBS RPMI.After MSC centrifugation, aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 ml 1% FBS RPMI (see Note 3).",
    "Count cells using a haemocytometer, using trypan blue exclusion and depending on well size needed for experiment, seed corresponding cell densities and co-culture with MDMs for 24 h (see Table 1).Proceed to either confocal microscopy or flow cytometry procedures.Confocal microscopy staining procedureAfter co-culture on a chamber slide, carefully aspirate off culture medium, and wash cells twice using 200 μl of ice cold PBS. Aspirate the PBS and fix the cells using 100 μl of 4% PFA solution. Incubate at room temperature with gentle agitation for approximately 15 min. After washing twice again with PBS, proceed to blocking the cells with 100 μl strong block for at least 1 h.Wash twice with PBS and add 50 μl of primary antibody mouse anti-human CD45 primary antibody or isotype control Mouse IgG1 (diluted 1:200) in weak block. Seal slide with Parafilm and incubate slide at 4 °C overnight with agitation.The next day, repeat the PBS wash step as before and then add 50 μl of secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit Alexafluor 405 secondary antibody (diluted 1:1,000 in weak block) for one hour. Incubate in the dark at room temperature for one hour.Immediately after, repeat the PBS wash step, taking care not to expose slide to light for longer than 10 min. Gently tap the chamber slide onto a paper towel to remove any excess PBS wash and then carefully dislodge the plastic chamber portion to separate the underlying microscope slide. Add approximately 2-3 drops of mounting medium and place a coverslip over the area of stained cells ensuring all air bubbles are removed. Allow to air dry for 30-45 min in the dark.When dry, use commercial nail varnish around the edges to act as glue and fix the coverslip in place. Leave nail varnish to dry in the dark at room temperature.",
    "The slide may also be stored at 4 °C long-term sealed with Parafilm in the dark for future analysis.Proceed to viewing using a confocal microscope (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170426/20170426030629_5128.jpgFigure 2. Visualization of transfer of MSC mitochondria to MDM by confocal microscopy. A. MDM express surface CD45 marker (blue); B. MSC mitochondria are stained with MitoTracker probe (red); C. After 24 h of co-culture mitochondrial positive TNT are observed, protruding from the MSC (arrows) ranging up to 200 µm in length. Mitochondrial transfer from MSC to MDM is evidenced by co-localisation of blue and red staining (pink). (Images were taken at magnification 10 x 63, scale bar = 75 µm). (Adapted from Jackson et al., Stem Cells[href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27059413]. 2016 Aug; 34(8): 2210-23)Flow cytometry staining procedureImmediately after co-culture place the 6 well plate on ice and aspirate off culture medium.Add 1 ml of ice cold 1% FBS PBS to the cell co-culture and lightly scrape using a cell scraper all over the well, so as to gently detach cells from the plastic surface.Once detached, place the cells into 5 ml polystyrene round bottomed flow tubes and centrifuge the cells at 800 x g for 5 min.In order to test viability of the cells after culture and detachment, it is necessary to include a live/dead control. This requires a separate tube of unstained cells and the addition of a live/dead marker stain Zombie Aqua (use according to manufacturer’s protocol).Decant off the supernatant, leaving the pellet submerged in approximately 100 µl of 1% FBS PBS. Vortex vigorously and add 2.5 μg/1 x 106 cells of FcR binding inhibitor to the cells and vortex this again.Leave in the dark and on ice for 30 min.",
    "After this time directly add 5 μl/1 x 106 cells of anti-human CD45 (PE) or Isotype control (IgG1 kappa) to the cell suspension and vortex again to mix thoroughly. Leave in the dark and on ice for 20 min. Following this, add an additional 1 ml of 1% FBS PBS to wash the cells and dispose of any unbound antibody. Vortex thoroughly.Centrifuge the suspension as before at 800 x g for 5 min.Decant the supernatant and repeat this wash step a final time. Resuspend the pellet in 200 μl of 1% FBS PBS and place the cells on ice in preparation for flow cytometry.Use FACS DIVA software to perform analysis. To rule out MSC-macrophage aggregates, single cells were gated as W-FSC vs. A-FSC and from this we defined CD45-PE+MitoRed-APC- population as MDM and also MitoRed-APC+CD45-PE- population as MSC (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170426/20170426030953_0809.jpgFigure 3. Quantification of mitochondrial transfer from MSC to MDM by flow cytometry. A-B. Live single cells were gated as W-FSC vs. A-FSC and from this we defined C. C. CD45-PE+ MDM population without co-culture with MSC is MitoRed-APC negative. D. APC+ MSC population alone is positive for mitochondria but negative for macrophage marker, CD45-PE-. E. After 4 h in co-culture MDM had acquired 92% of MSC mitochondria shown by the MitoRed fluorescence marker APC. F. Histogram illustrates a reduction in MitoRed fluorescence in the MSC population indicating robust donation of mitochondria to the MDM population.

    "coli, a total viable count of 1 x 108 colony forming units (CFU/ml) equates to an optical density (OD) of approximately 0.25-0.3 at 600 nm.Spin bacteria at 15,000 x g, for 5 min and resuspend the pellet using sterile 1 ml HBSS.After 24 h of MDM and MSC co-culture infect cells using a Multiplicity of Infection of 10 (MOI 10, see Note 4 for MOI calculation), using HBSS as a vehicle control.Incubate for 4 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.After this time, retrieve the supernatant from the cells for quantification of extracellular bacteria and make a dilution series of 10-1 to 10-6 in sterile PBS.Pipette 3 x 20 μl spots of each dilution out onto LB agar and incubate overnight at 37 °C.For intracellular bacteria wash the cells in 1 ml sterile PBS 3 times, aspirate wash and then add 300 μg/ml of gentamycin (diluted in 1% FBS RPMI), 100 μl/well and incubate at 37 °C for 1 h to kill adherent bacteria.After this time wash the cells in 1 ml sterile PBS 3 times, aspirate wash and add 100 μl of 0.5% saponin to lyse the cells and leave the bacteria intact.After 5 min, add an additional 900 μl of sterile PBS to each well to dilute saponin, and repeat the dilution series again, plating out each dilution. Incubate plates at 37 °C.Count CFU/ml within 24 h (Figures 4D-4G).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170426/20170426031600_0040.jpgFigure 4. Cytochalasin B blocks TNT-mediated mitochondrial transfer thereby preventing MSC functional effects on MDM. A. Confocal microscopy shows distinctive spindle MSC shape (red) with MDM (blue) in co-culture. TNT is shown to be present with robust mitochondrial transfer to MDM. B. Cytochalasin B pre-treatment of MSC inhibited actin filament elongation, causing them to appear rounded with loss of TNT structures.",
    "Mitochondrial transfer is still however evident due to probable microvesicle secretion from MSC to MDM (magnification 10 x 63, scale bar = 50 µm). C. Cytochalasin B treatment of MSC showed that MitoRed mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) decreased by 50% in MDMs in co-culture (*P < 0.05 Mann Whitney U test). D. After 4 h of live E.coli infection of the co-culture untreated MSC significantly reduced extracellular CFU, whilst simultaneously elevated intracellular CFU in macrophages, an effect recapitulated by stimulation with isolated MSC mitochondria (F + G). H. This effect was completely abrogated with cytochalasin B-treated MSC as even in their presence MDM phagocytosis remained unaffected.
