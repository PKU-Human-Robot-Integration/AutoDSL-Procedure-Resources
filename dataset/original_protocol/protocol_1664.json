    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDelivery of CRISPR genome editing reagents by Neon electroporation\nTiming: 4 h\nIn this step, the targeting vector for homology-mediated repair and sgRNA-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes are delivered into cells by electroporation. When comparing different sgRNAs, each sgRNA should be tested separately to determine the most efficient targeting sequence. To increase the yield of transfected cells, we transfect in triplicate and pool the three rounds of transfected cells.\nPrepare mTagBFP2 and mCherry targeting plasmid mixture.\nThaw plasmid prep (1:1 mixture of mTagBFP2:mCherry at 2.5 mg/mL concentration) purified in step 5 above. 5 μL of this mixture will be 6.25 μg of each plasmid and will provide sufficient DNA for a triplicate of transfections.\nPrepare ribonucleoprotein complexes using a 3:1 molar ratio of sgRNA:Cas9-NLS.\nResuspend Synthego chemically modified sgRNAs in TE, following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Using the extinction coefficient and molecular weight of the sgRNA provided by Synthego, measure sgRNA concentration by Nanodrop, and dilute sgRNA to 15 μM in TE.\nFor each sgRNA sequence, assemble a triple scale of RNP complexes in Neon Buffer R in a microcentrifuge tube. Assemble one tube for each triple reaction: Three reactions of CRISPR RNP complexes (triple scale)\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1222_17.csv\nStore at 18°C–22°C for one hour or less.\nIncubate Cas9 and sgRNA mixture at 18°C–22°C for 10 min. Place on ice.\nNote: According to Synthego, assembled CRISPR ribonucleoprotein complexes are stable at 18°C–22°C for 1 hour, at 4°C for up to a week, and at −20°C for up to one month.\nSet up Neon Transfection System apparatus\nUsing 10 μL Neon tips, set up a Neon Tube with 3 mL Buffer E in the Neon apparatus.",
    "Program the desired conditions for electroporation transfection, as determined by optimization with GFP transfection, above. The setting we use for U2OS cells is: 1230 V, 10 ms pulse width, and 4 pulses.\nPrepare cells for electroporation.\nWarm PBS, trypsin, and recovery media in a 37°C heat bath.\nBased on the number of transfections you plan to perform, calculate how many cells you need: In our case we use 300,000 U2OS cells per reaction, with 3 reactions per sgRNA (i.e., 900,000 cells for each sgRNA being used). Factor in one or two extra reactions to account for pipetting errors etc.\nSet up a 6-well plate with the appropriate antibiotic-free complete media and pre-incubate the plate in a humidified 37°C/5% CO2 incubator.\nTrypsinize cells (if adherent) and collect cells in media. Count cells and aliquot the number of cells determined above in step b. Pellet cells by centrifugation at 100×g for 5 min at 18°C–22°C . Remove liquid.\nRinse the cell pellet in warm PBS. Pellet cells by centrifugation at 100×g for 5 min at 18°C–22°C . Remove liquid.\nResuspend the cell pellet in Neon Buffer R (Invitrogen), using 5 μL Neon Buffer R per 300,000 cells.\nCritical: Buffer R reduces viability and time in this buffer should be minimized. Proceed directly to the next step. Do not let cells stay in Buffer R for more than 30 min.\nAssemble triplicate reactions for Neon Transfection.\nRemove the tubes containing 12.5 μL assembled triplicate of ribonucleoprotein complexes from ice (step 2.c.) and add 5 μL of the mTagBFP2 and mCherry plasmid mixture (from step 1.a.) to each of the tubes.\nAdd 15μL cell suspension (∼900,000 cells) to the mixture of RNP complexes and DNA (above). Pipette to mix. The total volume should now be 32.5 μL.",
    "Using the Neon 10 μL pipette, aspirate 10 μL of cell/RNP/DNA mixture into a 10μL Neon tip (avoid bubbles). Place pipette in Neon apparatus and apply electrical pulse by pressing ‘Start’ on the touchscreen.\nWhen electroporation has completed, immediately transfer cells from the Neon tip into the prepared, pre-warmed 6-well dish of antibiotic-free media.\nRepeat steps 5.c. and 5.d. twice more for a total of three transfections with the same tip and the same reaction mixture.\nNote: To conserve disposable items, a single Neon tip is used for each of the three triplicate reactions described above. After three reactions the tip is changed.\nChange to a new tip.\nAdd 15μL cell suspension to the next mixture of RNP complexes and DNA. Pipette to mix.\nPerform steps 5.c.–5.e. for this second reaction.\nRepeat this process—mixing cells with CRISPR reagents, electroporating, and plating cells—for all sgRNA mixtures being tested.\nAfter all transfections are complete, incubate cells in a humidified 37°C/5% CO2 incubator. It is important that cells are not disturbed and remain in antibiotic-free media for at least two days before analyzing, expanding, or adding antibiotics to the media.\nMonitor cells over the next four to seven days as they recover. Split and expand as needed.\nFreeze down a sample of the population of transfected cells as a backup.\nCritical: Avoid air bubbles in the Neon tip, which will lower transfection efficiency.\nNote: At this stage, it is useful to freeze down a population of transfected cells as a backup (step l.), lest anything happens to the main culture of transfected cells.",
    "Note: In our experience, different cell types can display differential sensitivity to the amount of DNA transfected. We use ∼4 μg per 10 μL electroporation with ∼300,000 U2OS cells, but for other cell types the total amount of DNA used may need to be adjusted to maximize recovery.\nAnalyze transfected cells for incorporation of fluorescent markers\nTiming: 3 h\nThe next step is to confirm that cassette integration at the target locus has occurred. As the mTagBFP2 and mCherry cassettes can only be expressed after successful genomic tagging, we use mTagBFP2 and mCherry expression—detected by flow cytometry—as a first indicator of proper integration. Double-positive cells indicate that two alleles are tagged, which for diploid cells corresponds to complete tagging. Untransfected cells are required at this step as a gating control, and a far-red viability dye is included to gate for live cells.\nCollect cells and stain with viability dye.\nTrypsinize (if adherent) transfected cells and collect in media. Be sure to replate some of the transfected cells to keep them growing. Count cells and collect ∼1 × 106 cells from each sample.\nTrypsinize (if adherent) untransfected cells and collect in media. Count cells and collect two samples of untransfected cells, one to stain with viability dye and one to remain unstained, ∼1 × 106 cells per sample.\nPellet cells by centrifugation at 100×g for 5 min at 18°C–22°C . Remove liquid.\nRinse cell pellets in warm PBS. Pellet cells by centrifugation at 100×g for 5 min at 18°C–22°C . Remove liquid.\nDilute Zombie NIR™ dye (BioLegend) at 1:2000 on PBS.\nResuspend cells in diluted 100 μL Zombie NIR™ solution (100 μL is sufficient for 1–10 × 106 cells). For the unstained untransfected sample, simply resuspend it in PBS.\nIncubate the cells at 18°C–22°C , in the dark, for 15–30 min.",
    "Wash one time with PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA).\nResuspend cells in PBS with 0.5% BSA to a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/mL. Pipet through strainer caps into 5 mL polystyrene tubes with 35 μm nylon mesh cell strainer caps. Place tubes on ice.\nNote: We use a far-red viability dye (Zombie NIR from BioLegend) since the mTagBFP2 signal overlaps with that of common DNA-based stains such as DAPI and Hoechst. If performing this process with different fluorescent markers in the tagging vectors, be sure to select a compatible viability dye.\nAnalyze cells by flow cytometry using a 4-laser Fortessa (BD Biosciences), or equivalent instrument equipped with 405 nM and 561 nM lasers to detect mTagBFP2 and mCherry markers respectively and a 633 nm laser to detect the Zombie NIR viability stain.\nUse the untransfected, unstained, cell sample to gate for single cells using forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC).\nSwitch to the untransfected, viability dye-stained, sample and gate for live cells by excluding cells that are positive for the viability dye, based on the unstained sample.\nSwitch to the transfected cell sample and, with reference to the untransfected samples, gate for cells that are positive for the fluorescent markers. If locus-specific integration of the targeting vectors occurred, you should see mTagBFP2-positive, mCherry-positive cells, and double positive cells. See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for examples of flow cytometry data of untransfected and transfected cells. Troubleshooting 2 (No fluorescently positive cells are apparent by flow cytometry analysis) and Troubleshooting 3 (mCherry positive cells are present, but not mTagBFP2 positive cells).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1222-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Flow cytometry analysis of genomic integration of fluorescent markers",
    "(A and B) Untransfected and (B) CRISPR-transfected U2OS cells were counterstained with Zombie-NIR viability dye (BioLegend) and then analyzed by flow cytometry to detect mTagBFP2 and mCherry expression. Forward scatter and side scatter are used to gate for single cells. Next, dead cells are excluded by gating against the Zombie NIR viability dye signal. Viable single cells are then analyzed for mCherry and mTagBFP2 signals using appropriate laser lines. In (B), distinct populations of mTagBFP2-positive, mCherry-positive, and double-positive cells are observed. The mTagBFP2-positive cells are gated in blue. The mCherry-positive cells are gated in red. The population of double positive cells are gated in black and purple. The purple box indicates the more stringent gating strategy which is used to select a population of double-tagged cells more confidently. Troubleshooting 4 (Sorted population of cells is not pure).\nNote: As shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], double positive cells can be fairly rare at this stage (0.1%–2%). In addition to doubly positive cells, there should be clear populations of singly-positive cells for mTagBFP2 and for mCherry.\nSort transfected cells to isolate doubly-positive cells\nAfter confirming that the pool of transfected cells contains cells that express mCherry and mTagBFP2, the next step is to enrich for fluorescent-positive cells by fluorescence activated cells sorting (FACS). We prefer to work with populations of modified cells, rather than clones, as this process is more rapid and avoids potential artifacts associated with cell cloning. But as a backup, we also sort for single cell cloning. Both processes are described here.\nTiming: 7–10 days\nFor population sorting, place 2 mL of appropriate complete media (including antibiotics) in each well of a 6-well dish. For single cell sorting, place 150 μL media into each well of a 96-well dish.",
    "Note: Some cell types require conditioned media for survival after single cell sorting.\nCollect transfected and untransfected populations and counterstain with a viability dye for flow cytometry as described in step 6.a.–6.i. For sorting cells, at step 6.i., reconstitute the cells to 10 × 106 cells/mL.\nSort double positive cells by FACS using a 4-laser FACSAria lll, or equivalent instrument, housed inside a biosafety cabinet. The instrument should be equipped with lasers to detect the fluorescent markers you are using, for example 405 nM and 561 nM lasers to detect mTagBFP2 and mCherry markers respectively, and 566 nm for the Zombie NIR viability dye.\nUse the untransfected, unstained, cell sample to gate for single cells using forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC).\nSwitch to the untransfected, viability dye-stained, sample and gate for live cells by excluding cells that are positive for the viability dye, based on the unstained sample.\nSwitch to the transfected cell samples and carefully gate for cells that are doubly positive for mTagBFP2 and mCherry. Be sure to gate in a way that will largely avoid collecting background, untagged cells (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nSort cells that meet the set gating criteria into the prepared plates with media and antibiotics. Collect populations in the 6-well dishes and single cells in the 96-well plates. In collecting populations, we typically collect 5,000–10,000 cells per transfected sample at this stage.\nAfter sorting, immediately place cells in a humidified 37°C/5% CO2 incubator.\nCritical: The gating for FACS should be stringent enough to minimize non-positive cells being erroneously collected. We gate towards the top fraction of cells that give signal for the fluorescent markers (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). In our experience, more stringent gating yields a purer population of efficiently tagged cells.",
    "Note: The number of cells collected in this process is typically limited by instrument time access. With a 90-min window of sorting, we typically recover one 96-well plate sorted for single cell clones and a 6-well dish with a total of 5,000–10,000 sorted doubly positive cells into a single well of a 6-well dish.\nFor single cell clones, incubate 96-well plates in a humidified 37°C/5% CO2 incubator, refreshing media as necessary, until clonal populations have formed visible colonies and are ready to move into larger dishes.\nFor the sorted population, one day after sorting, carefully change the media on cells to refresh antibiotics and to remove residual sheath fluid from sorting. Incubate cells in a humidified 37°C/5% CO2 incubator, refreshing media as necessary, until cells reach confluency.\nExpand the population of sorted cells for validation and analysis by Western blotting.\nFreeze down a subset of the population of sorted cells and any clonal populations as desired.\nValidate tagging by Western blotting\nNext, validate tagging of the target protein by Western blotting. At this step, also verify degradation of the protein of interest by analyzing a time course of cells treated with a degrader molecule. We have observed efficient target protein degradation with 500 nM dTAG-47 without need for optimization in multiple cell types. The concentration of degrader may, however, need to be optimized for other cell types or degrader molecules.\nTiming: 2–4 days\nPrepare lysates of enriched cells using your preferred method and analyze by Western blotting with target-specific antibody and a loading control antibody. Troubleshooting 4 (Sorted population of cells is not pure).",
    "Note: Efficient tagging and sorting will cause an increase in the apparent molecular weight of the target protein of ∼15 kDa; little if any untagged protein should remain. See Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A for an example of Western blot analysis of targeted populations of cells (tagging PDPK1) before and after sorting.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1222-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Western blot analyses of C-terminal tagging with FKBP(F36V)-2xHA.\n(A) PDPK1 was targeted for C-terminal FKBP(F36V)-2xHA tagging in U2OS cells. Two sgRNA sequences were analyzed (sg1 and sg2). Both sgRNAs result in a shifted band for PDPK1, even prior to flow cytometry sorting, indicative of efficient tagging. The sgRNA1 resulted in a more efficiently tagged population and this pool was taken forward for downstream analysis.\n(B) WDR5 was targeted for C-terminal tagging with FKBP(F36V)-2xHA in U2OS cells. A sorted population of cells was treated with 500 nM dTAG-47 degrader molecule or DMSO control for the indicated times and analyzed by Western blotting with comparison to an untargeted (untagged) population of cells.\nValidate small molecule-mediated degradation of the tagged protein using dTAG-47 (Guarnaccia et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Huang et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Popay et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Weissmiller et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]; Woodley et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]) or dTAG-13 (Nabet et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7], and available from Tocris Bioscience).\nPlate 1–2 million cells in 60 mm dishes, one plate for each treatment or time point (for example DMSO, 2 h dTAG, 6 h dTAG, and 24 h dTAG). In our experience, depletion of the target protein is noticeable within 1 h, and completes around 6 h of treatment with dTAG-47 molecule.\nThe next day, change media to media containing DMSO or 500 nM dTAG degrader molecule.\nAt the appropriate time points, collect cells, wash in PBS, and make lysates according to the preferred method for your cell line.",
    "Measure protein concentrations with Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye Reagent and resuspend lysates with SDS sample buffer supplemented with reducing agent.\nRun protein lysates on SDS-PAGE and transfer to a membrane for Western blotting with target-specific antibody, HA-specific antibody, and a loading control antibody.\nNote: Treatment with the degrader molecule, but not DMSO, should induce rapid depletion of the target protein. Most proteins we have targeted using this method show a considerable reduction at two hours and are >90% depleted by six hours. See Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B for an example of a time course Western blot analysis of a tagged protein (WDR5).\nNote: The dTAG-47 molecule is not currently commercially available and is only available by custom chemical synthesis. We had dTAG-47 synthesized by the Vanderbilt Chemical Synthesis Core. dTAG-13 is commercially available, but we have no experience with this degrader. Recently, Nabet et al., (Nabet et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) described a degrader, dTAGV-1, which is commercially available. dTAGV-1 connects FKBP(F36V) to the VHL ubiquitin protein ligase and may be advantageous under specific circumstances; dTAGV-1 may also be used in combination with CRBN-linked degraders to accelerate target protein destruction.\nNuclear run-on RT-qPCR\nTiming: 3 days\nOnce the required cells are obtained and validated, you can now assess the early transcriptional consequences of target protein depletion. This is done by treating cells with degrader molecules to induce protein depletion, performing a nuclear run-on (NRO), and purifying and quantifying the nascent transcripts (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). The appropriate timing of dTAG treatment in this experiment is determined from the Western blot validation in step 16 above, but note that earlier time points increase confidence that direct transcriptional changes are being monitored. Total RNA is also harvested in parallel to allow comparison of nascent transcripts. Total protein also can be harvested in parallel to confirm target degradation.",
    "imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1222-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Nuclear run-on assay following by RT-qPCR\n(A) Steps for analyzing nascent transcription and total transcript levels are outlined. CRISPR-engineered cells are cultured and the degradation of the target protein is induced by dTAG treatment. Eighty percent of the cells are used for the NRO; the remaining 20% are used for total RNA isolation and analysis. After purification, NRO-RNA and total RNA is reverse transcribed (with random primers) into cDNA that can then be detected by qPCR. Data for NRO RNA and total RNA are then compared, allowing an examination of transcription that may precede, or at least coincide, with changes in total transcript levels that are due to loss of the protein that was degraded.\n(B) Example data from NRO RNA isolated from cells treated with DMSO control or 500 nM dTAG-47 for 6 h. Signal is normalized to nascent ACTB transcripts. Data are represented as mean ± SEM; n = 3 independent biological replicates. ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗p < 0.05 by unpaired two-tailed t test.

    "Day 1:\nOne day prior to performing the NRO, plate FKBP(F36V)-tagged cells. Plate one 10 cm plate per sample with ∼5 × 106 cells. You will need a DMSO-treated control sample, and at least one sample treated with dTAG degrader molecule for the appropriate time (as determined by the time-course Western blot in step 16). We suggest testing two different time points for the first experiment to optimize for a timepoint.\nPlace cells in a humidified 37°C/5% CO2 incubator.\nNote: In our experience, the NRO-RT-qPCR assay can be performed with as few as 2 million cells per sample, but this number may need to be increased depending on the cells and rates of target gene transcription. Four million cells have worked well in our hands in multiple cell lines without need for further optimization.\nDay 2:\nTreat cells with dTAG degrader molecules to induce target protein depletion.\nRemove media from cells and replace with media containing DMSO or 500 nM dTAG degrader molecules.\nIncubate cells in a humidified 37°C/5% CO2 incubator for the selected time point(s).\nNote: The final DMSO concentration we use is 0.1% as some cells can be sensitive to higher DMSO levels.\nExtract nuclei from cells.\nTrypsinize cells (if adherent) and collect cells in their normal media. Collect cells by centrifugation at 400×g for 4 min at 4°C.\nResuspend cells in 1 mL ice-cold PBS.\nCount viable cells using trypan blue exclusion. Aliquot 4 × 106 viable cells per treatment sample into labeled 1.5 mL tubes and place on ice (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nFrom remaining cells, collect approximately 1 × 106 cells from each sample for total RNA extraction.\nPellet cells by centrifugation at 400×g for 4 min at 4°C and remove PBS.",
    "For mRNA analysis, if you are using the Zymo Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Kit, lyse cell pellets in 600 μL of TRIzol for at least 20 min on a rotator at 18°C–22°C . For protein analysis, prepare cell pellets for protein lysates according to your standard protocol.\nFor the NRO samples, pellet all cells by centrifugation at 400×g for 4 min at 4°C and remove PBS.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of ice-cold Nuclei Extraction Buffer supplemented with RNAse inhibitor and protease inhibitors as described in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section.\nIncubate samples on ice for 5 min.\nPellet nuclei at 300×g for 4 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant carefully by pipetting.\nGently wash the nuclei with 1 mL of Nuclei Extraction Buffer.\nImmediately pellet again at 300×g for 4 min at 4°C.\nResuspend the nuclei in 40 μL of Nuclei Storage Buffer.

Each reaction requires 60 μL of the 2× mix and you should have this buffer made fresh immediately prior to starting nuclear extraction.\nAdd 60 μL of 2× Transcription Buffer to each nuclei sample. Mix gently by pipetting (200 μL tip) until the nuclei are homogeneously dispersed.\nIncubate the samples for 30 min in a 30°C water bath to allow transcription to occur and nascent transcripts to be labeled by the incorporation of biotin-CTP.\nStop nuclear run-on reaction and purify RNA.",
    "Remove samples from the water bath and add 300 μL of TRIzol LS to each sample. Pipette up and down to mix until homogeneous. Typically, this mixture will be viscous and it can be helpful to cut the end of the pipette tip off with a sterile razor blade in order to increase its diameter to facilitate mixing.\nVortex each sample for 10 s and then rotate samples at 18°C–22°C for 5 min to complete lysis.\nPerform an RNA cleanup using a Zymo Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Kit, ensuring that you incorporate the on-column DNase-treatment step. At this time, you should also prepare the samples you collected for mRNA analysis (step 20.f.).\nAlternatives: We routinely use the Zymo Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Kit and find it produces reliable and consistent results, however, other RNA preparation protocols that include a DNase I-treatment step will likely work as an alternative.\nCritical: Because NRO-RT-qPCR primers are directed against introns or intron-exon boundaries, they have the potential to detect contaminating genomic DNA. As a result, efficient DNase I treatment of samples is crucial to minimize carry-over of genomic DNA.\nElute each sample (NRO and total RNA) in 25 μL of nuclease-free water into a fresh microcentrifuge tube.\nQuantify samples by Nanodrop, and record yield.\nPause point: At this point you can store the NRO RNA samples at −80°C for up to a week, but we recommend proceeding forward with the biotin enrichment as soon as possible, ideally within 24 hours. Total RNA can be stored at −80°C for at least a year.\nDay 3:\nPurify biotinylated NRO-RNA.\nFor each reaction, place 30 μL of Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1 bead slurry in a single 1.5 mL microfuge tube (e.g., if six NRO reactions are being processed, dispense 180 μL of bead slurry at this step).",

Troubleshooting 5 (No RNA pellet or altered appearance of RNA pellet following extraction).\nCarefully remove the liquid from around the small blue RNA/GlycoBlue pellet using a pipette. These pellets do not usually adhere to the side of the tube, making aspiration of the liquid difficult. If this happens, gently move the RNA containing pellet to the side of the tube with your pipette so that you can efficiently remove remaining liquid from the bottom of the tube.\nWash the RNA pellets by adding 500 μL of ice-cold 75% ethanol directly over the pellet.

Incubate samples for 5 min at 18°C–22°C to dissolve RNA. Mix by pipetting gently if necessary.\nNote: We do not quantify the yield at this step, as purified RNA levels are usually too low to measure accurately. The entire purified RNA sample is used in the next step.\nPause point: At this point, the purified NRO RNA can be stored at −80°C, but we recommend proceeding to the reverse transcription reaction as soon as possible.\nReverse-transcribe the purified NRO-RNA and purified total RNA.\nAssemble a 20 μL reverse transcription reaction by combining one half of the purified NRO-RNA (12 μL) with 4 μL NEB Luna LunaScript RT SuperMix and 4 μL of nuclease-free water.\nUse the other half of the purified NRO-RNA to prepare a -RT control reaction by combining 12 μL of purified RNA with 4 μL NEB Luna LunaScript No-RT Control Mix and 4 μL of nuclease-free water.\nAt this time, also reverse-transcribe 1 μg of each total mRNA sample using LunaScript RT and LunaScript No-RT mixes. Be sure to include a -RT control for these reactions as well.\nIncubate reactions in a thermocycler with the following steps:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1222_18.csv\nBring all cDNA samples to 80 μL by adding 60 μL of nuclease-free water.\nAlternatives: Any other preferred reverse transcription protocol can be used here at this step. Note, however, that for the NRO-RNA samples, random primers (as opposed to oligo-dT primers) must be used for the RT reaction.",
    "Critical: No-RT controls for both the NRO and total RNA samples are critical to ensure that signal in the qPCR assay is not coming from genomic DNA contamination. Assuming the DNase I digestion in step 22.c. was successful, there should be little if any signal from the -RT reactions in the qPCR analysis. Monitor at least one primer pair by qPCR of the No-RT cDNA samples to assess for any background signal from DNA. We routinely assess our control primers (GAPDH and ACTB) in No-RT qPCR.\nNote: cDNA reactions can be stored for up to a month at −20°C or a year at −80°C.\nPerform qPCR for the target genes of interest from the NRO cDNA samples.\nDilute NRO qPCR primers to a 10 μM working stock using nuclease-free water.\nPrepare a master mix for each primer. Each master mix should be sufficient for triplicate reactions for the RT samples, triplicate reactions for the No-RT samples, plus one extra reaction to account for loss. For example, for two NRO samples analyzed with the same primer sets (such as DMSO- and dTAG-treated), including both RT and No-RT reactions, prepare a master mix sufficient for 13 reactions. The table below outlines the recipe for a single reaction of this master mix. Scale up according to your sample number.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1222_19.csv\nNote: The final concentrations listed in this table refer to the final concentration after addition of the 1 μL cDNA, not to the final concentration of the master mix alone.\nPipette 14 μL of the appropriate master mix into each well of a qPCR plate.\nAdd 1 μL of cDNA reaction (prepared in step 25) to each well, as appropriate. Each well will now have a 15 μL volume.\nSeal qPCR plate with qPCR Plate Seals.",
    "Spin plate at 300×g for 1 min to collect liquid at the bottom of the wells.\nPlace the plate in a real-time PCR analyzer, such as the BioRad CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System, and perform the following cycling conditions. Note that a melting curve step can be performed as a final step to ensure that the primer pair produces a single product.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1222_20.csv\nPerform qPCR for the target genes of interest from the total RNA cDNA samples.\nDilute total RNA qPCR primers to a 10 μM working stock using nuclease-free water.\nPrepare a master mix for each primer, as in 26.b above. Each master mix should be sufficient for triplicate reactions for the RT samples, triplicate reactions for the No-RT samples, plus one extra reaction to account for loss.\nPipette 14 μL of the appropriate master mix into each well of a qPCR plate.\nAdd 1 μL of cDNA prepared from the total RNA (step 25) to each well, as appropriate.

Note that a melting curve step can be performed as a final step to ensure that the primer pair produces a single product.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1222_21.csv\nAnalyze qPCR data by the ΔΔCq method (for both NRO qPCR data and total RNA qPCR data).\nCalculate the average of the technical triplicates for each primer-sample reaction.\nCalculate ΔCq by subtracting the average Cq of the reference gene from the average Cq of the target gene: e.g., ΔCq = (Cqtarget – Cqreference)",
    "Calculate ΔΔCq of by subtracting the ΔCq of the control (DMSO) from the ΔCq of the treatment (dTAG): e.g., ΔΔCq = (ΔCqdTAG – ΔCqDMSO)\nCalculate the fold change between conditions by exponentially transforming the ΔΔCq values: calculate two raised to the power of negative ΔΔCq (e.g., Fold Change = 2−ΔΔCq)\nGraph the Fold Change results. See example graph of results in Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B and 5C.\nNote: Suitable normalization genes are transcripts that do not change upon depletion of the tagged target. In our experience, both ACTB and GAPDH are suitable normalization controls across assays and cell lines.\nCritical: The ΔΔCq method reports relative gene expression. Identifying and using an appropriate reference gene(s) that is not affected by degradation of the target protein is thus crucial. If a suitable normalization gene cannot be determined, an alternative quantification method should be used, for example using spike-in biotinylated RNA (see Alternatives below).\nAlternatives: As an alternative to the ΔΔCq method, a biotinylated spike-in control can be used. A protocol for producing BrdU-labeled luciferase transcript spike-in controls is described by Roberts et al. (Roberts et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]), and this protocol could be adapted to produce biotinylated luciferase spike in controls. Such spike in controls should be introduced during the nuclear run-on (at step 21.b.) and prior to RNA purification. For quantification, gene expression can be normalized to qPCR detection of the spike-in RNA(s).\nCompare the output NRO data to that from the total RNA samples. Changes that are evident in the NRO sample indicate a change in transcription. These changes are not always evident at the total RNA level, depending on the timing of the assay and processing of the transcript. See Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B and 5C for an example comparison of NRO and total RNA levels from the same sample."
