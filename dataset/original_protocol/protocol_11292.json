    "Animal studies were performed in accordance with institutional guidelines and protocols approved by the Vanderbilt University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Preparation and ex vivo irradiation of MFPs\nSacrifice athymic Nu/Nu mice (8–10 weeks) using CO­2 asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation.\nClean the skin using 70% ethanol.\nCollect mammary fat pads (MFPs) from sacrificed mice using pre-sterilized scissors and forceps in a 15 mL conical tube containing complete RPMI media (RPMI supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum) (see the Table of Materials).\nIrradiate samples to 20 Gy using a cesium source.\nBring the irradiated MFPs and complete RPMI media into a biosafety cabinet. The media will be dependent on the cell line to be grown in the final hydrogel. Fill 6 cm or 10 cm dishes with enough media to submerge the MFPs. For 6 cm dishes, use 8 mL of media, and for 10 cm dishes, use 20 mL of media.\nIncubate in a 37 °C/5% CO2 incubator for two days. The length of time in the incubator may be adjusted.\nRinse tissues in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), blot excess moisture, and place MFPs into 15 mL conical tubes for storage at -80 °C until decellularization. This freezing step aids the decellularization step and the sample should be frozen even if the next steps are otherwise ready.\n2. Decellularization (adapted from references12,16,17)\nNOTE: This procedure was adapted from previously published methods focused on adipose decellularization, which included the sodium deoxycholate ionic detergent rather than sodium dodecyl sulfate to remove DNA efficiently12,16,17.\nOn day 1, remove frozen MFPs from -80 °C and thaw at room temperature.\nOnce thawed, dry MFPs briefly on a delicate task wipe. Weigh the MFPs using an analytical scale.",
    "Using a pair of forceps with scissors or a scalpel, divide tissue up into 3 mm x 3 mm x 3 mm samples for study of the intact ECM and the remaining tissue for hydrogel production.\n\tNOTE: The number of samples is dependent on the number of testing methods, e.g. the collection of two samples is described below: one for paraffin embedding (step 2.5) and one for freezing in cryostat embedding medium, if desired (see the Table of Materials and step 2.6).\nWeigh the tissues. If embedding in paraffin for sectioning, continue to step 2.5. If freezing in cryostat embedding medium for sectioning, continue to step 2.6.\nIn a chemical hood, submerge the tissue in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) (see the Table of Materials) for 24 h at 4 °C. Wash 3 times in PBS for 5 min each. Submerge the tissue in 30% sucrose for 48 h at 4 °C.\n\t\nWeigh the tissue now that this piece has been removed. Continue to step 2.6.\nIn a chemical hood, place MFP pieces in a labeled cassette prepped with cryostat embedding medium. Add more cryostat embedding medium to cover the tissue.\n\t\nPlace the cassette into a beaker of 2-methylbutane (see the Table of Materials) that is pre-cooled with liquid nitrogen. The beaker should have enough 2-methylbutane to cover the bottom but not enough to submerge the cassette because the cryostat embedding medium should not touch the 2-methylbutane. Let the cassette sit in the 2-methylbutane until the cryostat embedding medium freezes and becomes opaque.\nWrap the cassette(s) in foil, label, and leave at -80 °C until used for sectioning.\n\t\tNOTE: Tissues placed immediately in cryostat embedding medium were sectioned at 5 μm while tissues incubated in sucrose were sectioned at 30 μm to retain adipocyte morphology.",
    "Use forceps to manually massage the remaining tissue.\n\tNOTE: Tissue pieces may also be placed in 10% NBF for 24–48 h, rinsed in PBS, and left in 70% ethanol until embedding in paraffin. Following embedding, 5 μm sections can be used for hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining (see section 7 below).\nPlace the MFPs in 6 cm dishes with 5 mL 0.02% trypsin/0.05% EDTA solution. Incubate at 37 °C for 1 h. Spray and wipe the dishes with 70% ethanol before placing in the incubator.\nUse 0.7 mm strainers to wash the MFPs with deionized (DI) water by pouring water over the tissue three times. Use forceps to manually massage the tissue in between washes.\nBriefly dry tissue on a delicate task wipe and weigh. Place tissues in a pre-autoclaved beaker containing an appropriately sized stir bar. Cover tissues with 60 mL of 3% t-octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol (see the Table of Materials) per 1 g of tissue and stir for 1 h at room temperature. Use a minimum of 20 mL.\nDump tissue and contents into a strainer. Rinse the beaker with DI water and pour onto tissues. Repeat two more times. Use forceps to manually massage the tissue in between rinses.\nBriefly dry tissue on a delicate task wipe and weigh. Place tissues and stir bars back in the same beakers, and cover with 60 mL of 4% deoxycholic acid per 1 g of tissue. Stir for 1 h at room temperature. Use a minimum of 20 mL.\nDump tissue and contents into a mesh strainer. Rinse the beaker with DI water and pour onto tissues. Repeat two more times. Use forceps to manually massage the tissue in between rinses.\nBriefly dry tissue on a delicate task wipe and weigh.",
    "Place tissues in the same beaker with fresh DI water supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Cover tightly with paraffin film. Leave overnight at 4 °C.\nWash strainers and beakers for use the following day.\nOn day 2, drain beaker contents into a strainer. Briefly dry tissue on a delicate task wipe and weigh.\nPlace MFPs in the same beaker with an appropriately sized stir bar. Cover with 60 mL 4% ethanol/0.1% peracetic acid solution per 1 g of tissue. Use a minimum of 20 mL. Stir for 2 h at room temperature.\nDump tissue and contents into a 0.7 mm strainer. Use forceps to manually massage the tissue. Place contents back into the beaker. Wash tissue by covering it with 60 mL of 1x PBS per 1 g of tissue. Use a minimum of 20 mL. Stir for 15 min at room temperature. Repeat once.\nDump tissue and contents into a 0.7 mm strainer. Use forceps to manually massage the tissue. Place contents back into beaker. Wash tissue by covering it with 60 mL DI water per 1 g of tissue. Use a minimum of 20 mL. Stir for 15 min at room temperature. Repeat once.\nBriefly dry tissue on a delicate task wipe and weigh. Dump tissue and contents into a strainer. Use forceps to manually massage the tissue.\nPlace contents back into beaker. Cover tissues with 60 mL of 100% n-propanol per 1 g of tissue. Use a minimum of 20 mL. Stir for 1 h at room temperature.\nBriefly dry tissue on a delicate task wipe and weigh. Dump tissue and contents into a 0.7 mm strainer. Use forceps to manually massage the tissue.",
    "Place contents back into beaker. Wash tissue by covering it with 60 mL of DI water per 1 g of tissue. Use a minimum of 20 mL. Stir for 15 min at room temperature. Repeat three times.\nDump tissue and contents into a strainer. Repeat steps 2.3–2.6 to collect pieces of tissue for sucrose incubation and freezing in cryostat embedding medium.\nBriefly dry tissue on a delicate task wipe and weigh. Place in a labeled 15 mL tube. Freeze at -80 °C overnight.\n3. Lyophilization\nRemove the 15 mL tubes from -80 °C and place on dry ice. Keep samples frozen on dry ice until on the lyophilizer.\nRemove caps. Use a rubber band to attach a delicate task wipe to the top to cover the opening. Put samples on the lyophilizer for at least 2 days.\nRemove samples from the lyophilizer and place tubes on dry ice. Remove delicate task wipes weigh each sample on an analytical scale. Attach caps and place at -80 °C overnight.\n4. Milling\nFill a shallow container with liquid nitrogen. Remove samples from the -80 °C freezer. Weigh each lyophilized MFP.\nPlace one sample in the mortar. Use a cryogenic glove to hold the mortar in the liquid nitrogen.\nUse a pestle attached to a handheld drill to mill the sample. Mill in 1 min intervals to check progress and remove gloved hand from liquid nitrogen. Mill for a minimum of 5 min.\nRepeat for all samples. Spray and wipe the mortar and pestle with ethanol between each sample.\nStore powdered samples in 15 mL tubes at -80 °C until ready for use.\n\tNOTE: Samples may be used immediately or stored overnight.\n5. Hydrogel formation",
    "If stored at -80 °C overnight, remove and thaw at room temperature. While thawing, calculate the necessary weight of pepsin (see Table of Materials) and volume of hydrochloric acid (HCl) needed for each sample that results in a solution with 1% w/v sample powder and 0.1% w/v pepsin in 0.01 M HCl. Add the pepsin to the HCl to form a pepsin-HCl solution.\nAdd sample powder and pepsin-HCl solution to a 15 mL tube. Add a small stir bar, and stir for 48 h.\nPlace the tubes on ice for 5 min. Calculate the necessary volume of 10x PBS needed for each sample that results in a solution with a 1x PBS concentration. Add the appropriate volume of 10x PBS to each tube.\nAdd 10% v/v 0.1 M NaOH to each solution to reach pH 7.4. Use a pH paper to test individually.\n\tNOTE: Gel solution may be stored at 4 °C for one week.\n6. Encapsulating cells in hydrogels\nUsing GFP- and luciferase-labeled cells\n\t\nUsing the pH 7.4 gel solution, resuspend pelleted GFP- and luciferase-labeled 4T1 cells to a concentration of 500,000 or 1,000,000 cells/mL of gel solution. Add 16 µL of gel-cell solution to each well of a 16-well chamber slide. Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C.\nAdd 100 µL of complete RPMI media to each well. Continue incubation for 48 h at 37 °C. The GFP- and luciferase-labeled cells can be visualized using fluorescence microscopy at 0 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after gelation.",
    "NOTE: Cell proliferation can be measured for the GFP- and luciferase-labeled 4T1 cells used here by adding (S)-4,5-Dihydro-2-(6-hydroxy-2-benzothiazolyl)-4-thiazolecarboxylic acid potassium salt (see the Table of Materials) to the wells for 10 min and performing bioluminescence imaging using a bioluminescence imaging system (see Table of Materials). Following bioluminescence imaging, the cytoskeleton can be visualized (see section 10).\nUsing unlabeled cells\n\t\nUsing the pH 7.4 gel solution, resuspend pelleted unlabeled 4T1 cells to a concentration of 500,000 or 1,000,000 cells/mL of gel solution. Add 16 µL of gel-cell solution to each well of a 16-well chamber slide and a 96-well plate. Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C.\nAdd 100 µL of media to each well. Continue incubation for 48 h at 37 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Cell viability can be measured (see section 11). The 16-well chamber slide can be used for imaging, and the 96-well plate can be used for quantification.\n7. H & E staining\nFor formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue, submerge slides containing 5 μm sections twice in 100% xylene (5–10 min) for de-paraffinization. Rehydrate by submerging in 100%, 95%, 85%, and 70% ethanol for 5 min each followed by DI water for 5 min. Continue to step 7.6.\nFor frozen tissue sections, take sections immediately from freezer and submerge them in 10% NBF for 10 min. Wash in 1x PBS three times for 5 min each. Rinse in water for 5 min.\nStain nuclei with hematoxylin for 3 min. Rinse in running tap water.\nDifferentiate by dipping 1–2 times in 0.3% acid alcohol (0.3% HCl in 70% ethanol). Rinse in running tap water for 5 min.\nAdd bluing agent for 30 s. Rinse in running tap water for 5 min. Submerge in 95% ethanol for 30 s.",
    "Incubate with eosin for 90 s at room temperature. Dehydrate in 3 changes of 100% ethanol for 5 min each.\nSubmerge twice in 100% xylene for 5 min each. Add distyrene-plasticiser-xylene (DPX0 mounting media to the slide and add a coverslip. Let it cure overnight before imaging.\n8. 1-([4-(Xylylazo)xylyl]azo)-2-naphthol staining\nPrepare 1-([4-(Xylylazo)xylyl]azo)-2-naphthol solution.\n\t\nAdd 0.5 g of 1-([4-(Xylylazo)xylyl]azo)-2-naphthol powder to a beaker with 100 mL propylene glycol. Heat to 95–100 °C while stirring for at least 30 min. Prevent the temperature from exceeding 100 °C.\nRemove beaker from heat and allow to cool slightly. Pour solution through grade 4 qualitative filter paper to remove any residual particulates.\n\t\tNOTE: The solution can be stored at room temperature and should be filtered through a 0.45 µm syringe filter immediately before staining.\nStain frozen tissue sections.\n\t\nRemove slides from the -80 °C freezer and air dry for 30 min. Pre-cool 10% NBF at -20 °C for 30 min in a Coplin jar. Fix the slides at room temperature for 10 min. Wash in DI water 3 times for 5 min each.\nRemove excess water using a delicate task wipe before immersing in propylene glycol 2 times for 5 min each. Remove slides from propylene glycol. Do not rinse.\nPlace slides into syringe filtered Oil Red O staining solution for 3 h at room temperature.\nDifferentiate by placing slides in 85% propylene glycol for 5 min. Rinse samples in PBS twice for 5 min each.\nStain samples with hematoxylin for 30 s. Wash in running tap water for 5 min and then place the slides in DI water.\nMount samples using aqueous based mounting medium and allow media to dry overnight before imaging.\n9. Rheology\nBring pre-gel solutions from step 5.4 to the rheometer on ice.",
    "Attach a 25 mm arm and plate to the rheometer. Open the rheology software on the computer connected to the rheometer.\nPerform rotational mapping and determine the zero gap. Raise the arm when complete.\nPipette 500 μL of pre-gel on the plate. Lower the arm until the pre-gel solution completely occupies the gap between the plate and the arm. Be conservative because lowering the arm past this point will result in pre-gel solution spilling out of the side.\nPerform a frequency sweep on the pre-gel solution from 0.1–100 Hz after it has remained at 37 °C for 30 min.\nRaise the rheometer arm when complete. Wipe liquid with a delicate task wipe. Rinse with DI water and wipe with a delicate task wipe. Repeat steps 9.4–9.6 with additional samples.\n10. Phalloidin conjugate staining of F-actin\nBring phalloidin conjugate solution to room temperature. Briefly centrifuge at a low speed prior to opening. Aliquot enough solution for the assay, and store the rest at -20 °C.\nDilute 1000x phalloidin conjugate stock solution to a 1x working solution by adding 1 μL stock solution to 1 mL 1x PBS + 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). This makes enough for 10 wells (100 μL/well).\n\tNOTE: One may use plain 1x PBS, but 1x PBS + BSA is preferred to prevent phalloidin conjugate from sticking to the tube. Do not store this solution after the assay. 1 μL of blue fluorescent dye (see the Table of Materials) working solution may be added to stain for nuclei. Working solution may be made by mixing 1 μL of 20 mM blue fluorescent dye with 11.3 μL 1x PBS.\nAspirate media from wells (step 6.1). Rinse wells with 1x PBS.",

Aspirate and wash 3 times with PBS for 5 min each time. Leave in PBS at 4 °C.\nAspirate and remove wells from the gasket on the chamber slide. Use needle nose tweezers to remove the gasket from the slide. Mount and coverslip samples using aqueous based mounting medium. Allow to cure (5 min).\nObserve cells under a fluorescence microscope at excitation/emission of 590/618 nm.\n11. Viability assay\nRinse the cells with Dulbecco’s PBS (DPBS). Add 100 µL of DPBS containing 1 µM calcein AM and 2 µM ethidium homodimer to each well. Incubate for 30 min at room temperature.\nImage the 16-well chamber slide by fluorescence microscopy. Calcein acetoxymethyl (calcein AM) can be observed at excitation/emission = 494/517 nm. Ethidium homodimer can be observed at excitation/emission = 528/645 nm.\nRead the 96-well plate on a plate reader using the same wavelengths in step 11.2.\nSubscription Required.
