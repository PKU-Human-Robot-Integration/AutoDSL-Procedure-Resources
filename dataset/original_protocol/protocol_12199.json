  "procedures": [
    "The procedures described below have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Ohio State University.\n1. Preparation of Enriched Environment Prior to Housing Mice\nCleaning and maintaining instruments.\n\t\nRun the large enrichment bin (120 cm x 90 cm x 76 cm) through a cage wash. A typical Animal Facility cage wash protocol includes 5 to 6 washing cycles, with the last cycle reaching 82 ºC. The whole washing should take approximately 40 min. Air-dry the bin.\n\t\t\nIf the large enrichment bin, and any other housing instruments, cannot be sent through cage wash, then spray and wipe down the inside of the bin with sporicidal disinfectants following the manufacturer’s instructions. Wipe off the bin with a tap water soaked paper towel or 30% ethanol and dry with a paper towel to get rid of any scent from the previous disinfectant.\nUse plastic tubing, igloos with saucer type wheels, and other various plastic hutch-like toys in the EE. Wash these toys through a cage wash. If you do not have access to a cage wash follow step 1.1.1.1.\nUse metal running wheels in the EE. Wash wheels through a cage wash. If the paint on the wheels starts to fade so that the wheel becomes noisy when the animals run on it, apply a small amount petroleum jelly to where the wheel and axel connect.\nUse wooden logs in the EE. Clean the logs by removing any bedding or other debris by hand. Then sterilize the logs by autoclaving them on a dry cycle or textile cycle, which reaches a temperature of 121 ºC for 15 min.",
    "Use cages between dimensions of 29 cm x 18 cm x 12.5 cm and 30.5 cm x 19 cm x 14 cm to hold a feeding and drinking wire rack.Cut a hole at least 5 cm in diameter out of the front-bottom of the cage for mice to go in and out of from the EE. Clean these feeding cages through cage wash.\nSetting up the environment\n\t\nPour ¼-inch corn cob laboratory animal bedding into the large enrichment bin. Cover the entire floor surface of the bin to a depth of 2-2.5 cm with bedding.\nPlace two or three logs in one corner of the bin. Place logs in the corner to sequester an area of about 1,225 cm2. In the area sequestered by the logs, place three igloos with saucer wheels on top. Make sure the wheels are not touching the walls of the bin, the logs, or each other, so that there is enough room for the wheels to spin freely.\nPiece together the plastic tubing so that multiple arms branch out from the centeral connecting piece. Place this tubing in the middle of the bin.\nAt two corners of the bin, place one feeding cage each filled with the same bedding as the bin, and the hole in the front of the feeding cage should be facing towards the center of the bin. On top of these feeding cages a clean food and water wire should be placed to hold food and water. Do not place any lid on the cage. Put food and water in the cage wires.",
    "Place three metal wheels in the bin, though not all next to each other. The three different types of wheels are one 11.5 cm wheel, one 20.5 cm wheel, and one 28 cm wheel. Then place 4-5 more plastic hutch-like toys or tunnels throughout the enrichment bin.\nCover the bin with micro-isolator filter paper. Use binder clips to clip the filter paper to the bin.\nNovelty is important to EE. Use this setup as the framework of the EE and vary the placement of aforementioned cages, objects, and toys to create a novel environment for the animals.\n2. Housing the Animals\nBreed animals for experiments in regular laboratory housing and not EE. Optionally, place the animals in EE as early as 21 days of age upon weaning. Genotype and ear punch/tag animals prior to EE housing.\nWhen placing animals into the enrichment bin from a standard cage, place the cage in the bin on its side so that the animals can move freely from the standard cage to the enrichment bin. Do not allow the nesting materials to be transferred into the enrichment bin.\nHouse 10-20 animals of the same age, gender, and genetic strain in the EE.\n3. Maintaining the Environment and Observing the Mice During Studies\nDaily\n\t\nQuietly observe the animals for signs of illness or distress. If necessary, gently handle the animals to further inspect health conditions. Record abnormal observations and consult a health technician or veterinarian staff if the animal displays conditions that require removal from the experiment.",
    "Provide topical treatment with triple anti-biotic ointment for small wounds or scabs. If an animal needs to be removed due to a chronic illness or injury, remove the animal from the experiment for euthanasia. If animals meet early removal criteria for the overseeing animal research care committee or veterinarian, do not return animals back to EE.\nTwice a Week\n\t\nCheck the feed and water levels. Ensure that feed and water will last for the next 3-4 days. Straighten up running wheels and enrichment toys so that they are spread out and can be used by mice. Replace any that are too dirty.\nWeekly\n\t\nReplace water bottles with clean water bottles. Rearrange enrichment devices in a manner that follows the setup in Section 1.2. yet is different from the setup of the previous week. \n\t\t​NOTE: If an experiment requires the animals to be removed from the enriched environment for an activity (recording body weight, blood draw, behavior test, etc.) it is best to rearrange the environment while the animals are away from the enrichment bin.\nClean the feeding cages in the EE by hand or send it through cage wash as detailed in Section 1.1.5. Replace the wire racks that hold the food and water with clean wire racks as well.\nFollow the instruction in Section 2.2. when placing the animals back in enrichment. Spot check the rest of the large enrichment bin and clean, if necessary, by scooping out dirty litter and spreading down new clean bedding.\nBi-weekly\n\t\nWhile performing the weekly husbandry, clean the toys by hand or send through cage wash as detailed in Section 1.1.2. If needed, place the mice in a standard micro-isolator cage for the time required to clean.\nMonthly",
    "Clean the majority of the litter out by moving enrichment toys and feeding cages and scooping out the litter. Replace with fresh litter. Ensure that there is one inch of bedding in all areas of the cage. If needed, place the mice in a standard micro-isolator cage for the time required to clean.\nEvery Three Months (or At End of Experiment)\n\t\nRemove all bedding and toys and clean and disinfect the enrichment bin as described in Section 1.1.1. If the experiment is ongoing, replace with new bedding, feeding cages, assortment of toys and then return the mice to the bin.\nDisinfect the entire enrichment bin more frequently than every three months if required by the research institution in which the EE is housed. If this is necessary and another large enrichment container is available, set up the additional enrichment container as detailed in Section 1.2. and transfer the animals to the new container, while the previous one is being cleaned.\n4. Control Housing Conditions\nHouse animals in the control group in micro-isolator cages of dimensions 30.5 cm x 19 cm x 14 cm. Include a wire rack in the cage for holding food and a water bottle, if the cage is not hooked up to a automatic watering system.\nProvide the same corn cob bedding in the control cage as is in the EE. Provide a 4 cm x 4 cm nestlet for the mice to make a nest out of.\nReplace and/or clean the cages, feeding wires, food and water once a week. Clean cages and wire racks through cage wash or as detailed in Section 1.1.1.1. Clean the cages more often if animals urinates more frequently or if the drinking water leaks onto the bedding.",
    "Monitor the health of the animals in control housing daily. Assure the animals have plenty of food and water.\nHouse 3~5 mice of the same gender in regular mouse cage. Do not provide any toy, tube, or hutch in the cage.\nInstitutional laboratory animal care facility health and laboratory technicians may provide husbandry for these control mice.\nKeep animals on a 12 hr light/dark cycle as is for the mice in EE."
