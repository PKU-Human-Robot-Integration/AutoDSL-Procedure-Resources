    "Habituation and procedural learningBefore starting the training sessions, animals must be familiarized with the reinforcers, the experimenter, and the testing arena. Before learning any reward contingency rule, mice have to learn how to control events taking place in the arena.Habituation to the reward: Three days before starting the testing (Day -3), place 200 μl condensed milk in the vials (lids of 15-ml Falcon tubes, without any liner) and set two of these vials overnight in each cage housing the mice to be tested. Undiluted condensed milk is sticky, and empty vials witness that tasting has occurred.Habituation to the setup: The following day (Day -2), bring the mice to the testing room and release them in the waiting zone of the testing arena, in the same groups as they are housed. When introduced to a novel environment, rodents feel safer in the presence of their cage-mates, because companionship provides protection from potential environmental threats (Kikusui et al., 2006). On the floor of the reward zone, scatter four vials baited with 100 μl condensed milk diluted 1:1 with water. Allow the mice to roam freely and toggle between the waiting and the reward zone, occasionally activating the door and the sliding lids that will cover the testing vials. Monitor mice behavior via the camera. The session lasts at least 5 min but continues until all the mice have tasted the reward. Recollect the mice and identify them individually with marks on the tails using a non-toxic felt-tip pen. Bring the mice back to their usual cage and, in the evening, re-set the two vials with 200 μl condensed milk in each cage. Weigh the mice and reduce chow food to 1 g per mouse for the night.",
    "Procedural learning: The following day (Day -1), release the mice individually into the waiting zone with the door closed. The pedestal should already be in place in the reward zone, covered with black adhesive tape and carrying two neutral vials (no liner), both baited with 15 μl diluted condensed milk. Open the door and confine the mouse to the reward zone until it consumes the milk in one of the two vials. Monitor mouse behavior via the camera and close the other vial with the sliding lid when the mouse starts licking the milk in the chosen vial. Once the milk is consumed, cover the empty vial, and re-open the gate between the reward and waiting zone. If the mouse does not re-enter the waiting zone spontaneously, gently push it back using a “shovel” identical to the one used as a sliding lid: mice will readily learn to respond to the presentation of this object by retiring to the waiting zone. Close the gate, withdraw the pedestal from the arena, and re-bait the visited vial using a Gilson pipetman; then, re-place the pedestal in the arena and open the gate again. Mice have to learn to toggle between the waiting and reward zone to seek and consume the reward. When a mouse has retrieved at least 4 rewards, and after at least 5 min have passed, withdraw the mouse using a cardboard tunnel (avoid tail handling), refresh the tail mark, and move the mouse back to the home cage. If the mouse has not retrieved 4 rewards after 5 min, allow it to stay longer until 4 rewards have been retrieved, but abort the training after 20 min if the mouse still has not consumed the rewards.",
    "When all mice in a batch have been trained, transfer to the vivarium, weigh each mouse, and give food ad libitum. Again, if the animals have not lost more than 10% of their initial body weight, restrict food to 1 g chow/mouse overnight. A second procedural training day (Day 0) may be necessary if more than 2 mice per group did not consume four baits within 20 min.Learning of the first rule-reward contingency: Day 1 to the day of criterion attainmentTable 1. Example of the daily spreadsheetimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210730/20210730174528_0233.png Bring the mice to the test room one hour before starting the training session. Switch on the indirect lights and camera. For reward contingency rule learning, the vials containing the baits and the pedestal should now be lined with patterns: one with white tape and the other with brown sandpaper. Balance the reward contingency among mice, such that an equal number of animals per test group associates the reward with each liner. For example, to compare learning ability in group A vs. group B, the reward must be associated with the white or brown liner in an equal number of mice in group A as that in group B. This is important to compensate for possible biases in the preference for one of the two patterns. Prepare a daily spreadsheet as shown in Table 1, with one line for each mouse. The experimenter will record independent and dependent variables in the columns, such as: Column 1: cage ID; Column 2: treatment (coded); Column 3: genotype (coded); Column 4: mouse ID; Column 5: reward pattern; Columns 6-22: correct/incorrect response; Columns 23 and 24: start and end time (Table 1). The sequence of the side of the rewarded vial changes every day by progressing one step, as described in Table 2.Table 2.",
    "Example of sequence for reward presentationimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210730/20210730174547_1909.png Start training: Transfer the first mouse to the waiting zone, bait the vial with the pattern attributed to that animal, and open the door. The mouse should readily enter the reward zone and visit one of the vials. Check mouse behavior from the monitor without leaning over the arena when the mouse is in the reward zone. A choice is made when the mouse touches the vial with its snout or paws. If a correct choice is made, allow the mouse to consume the reward and cover the other vial with the sliding lid. If a wrong choice is made, quickly cover both vials with the sliding lids. If the mouse does not run back to the waiting zone, gently push it back with a plastic shovel identical to the sliding lids. Usually, mice learn to toggle between the zones during this first training day. Once the mouse is back in the waiting zone, close the door, remove the pedestal and, if necessary, re-bait and re-place in the arena according to the scheduled side sequence; then, re-open the door. Proceed until 16 trials have been completed or 30 min has elapsed, whichever comes first. Usually, mice take 15-20 min to complete 16 trials during the first few training days, and only 5 min after 4-6 days. Mice not completing 16 trials after the first two training days suggest reduced motivation or excessive anxiety. If the source of the failure is not detected, these mice should be excluded from further testing. When all mice in one batch have completed the training session, bring them back to the vivarium, weigh them, and give them food.",
    "Overnight food restriction of 1 g/mouse only applies if animals have not lost more than 10% of their original, pre-training body weight. After three days of training, food restriction is no longer necessary as mice will usually keep working for the pleasure; however, it can be re-introduced if animals fail to complete the 16-trial session over 30 min. For example, in our experience, food restriction can be stopped on day 4 without a subsequent reduction in performance of C57BL/6J mice (Hörnberg et al., 2020). Follow the same procedure for the subsequent days until a pre-defined learning criterion is attained. A reliable criterion consists of attaining 8 consecutive correct responses for two days, which usually occurs after 5 days of training.Rule reversal learningThe day following attainment of the first learning criterion, mice will start a contingency reversal training, i.e., the previously rewarded pattern will now be associated with a rejection response (sliding lid), while the previously non-rewarded pattern is now baited. The first 2 trials of the reversal section are discovery trials: the mouse is allowed to explore both vials and consume the newly rewarded one. Discovery trials are meant to maintain the reward-seeking behavior even upon a first choice being made on the now empty vial that results in rejection. In addition, discovery trials prime the learning of the reversed contingency. These two trials are not counted during this first reversal training session, which continues with 16 trials as usual. As before, the learning criterion is 8 consecutive correct responses for two days in a row. Reversal learning is usually attained after 7-10 days; however, it is useful to continue training all animals until all have attained criteria in order to compare the consistency of responses over time.",
    "If some mice have not learned after 12 days, the trial can be stopped. The entire procedure, with its timeline, is graphically summarized in Figure 4.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210801/20210801174930_2836.jpgFigure 4. Schematic overview of the experimental timeline"
