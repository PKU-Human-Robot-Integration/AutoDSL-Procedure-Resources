    "Harvest lymph nodes (LNs) and place in 2 ml of PLP or 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 4 °C for fixation.Notes: This step is optional but crucial for preserving cellular morphology, but may compromise certain antibody staining. One example we have tested is anti-XCR1 (clone: ZET) where fixation abrogates staining. PLP is preferable for preserving fine cellular morphology, such as cell dendrites.All procedures involving animals must be performed according to approved institutional, regional or national protocols (as applicable) by appropriately trained and certified personnel. After fixation (4-6 h for small LNs, and up to 12 h for larger tissues, such as swollen LN after inflammation), transfer tissues into 2 ml of cold PBS and keep on ice.Embed tissues into agarose gel:Pour warm 2% agarose in PBS (boiled then cooled under running tap water until warm to touch) into wells in 24-well plates;Embed tissues into wells loaded with warm agarose and in desired orientation, Figure 1 (Each LN should touch the bottom of the well and will later be sliced parallel to this plane);Make sure the plate is level and leave on ice to allow agarose to set.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160911/20160911231600_7631.jpgFigure 1. Embedding LN in agarose gel. Pour warm agarose into wells, embed LN into agarose and adjust to desired orientation (left). Allow agarose to set (right).Meanwhile, start up the vibratome and calibrate the cutting blade as per manufacturer’s instructions. Prepare an ice bath and fill the buffer tray with cold PBS, Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160911/20160911231651_2604.jpgFigure 2. Setting up vibratome. Insert blade and calibrate, prepare ice bath, and fill buffer tray with cold saline buffer.Remove the agarose block containing the LN with a pair of forceps and carefully trim into cuboid shape with a razor blade, Figure 3.Apply 1-2 strips of 3M Durapore tape to the specimen holder.",
    "Attach the trimmed LN/agarose block on the specimen holder (with the LN near the top of the block) using a drop of Vetbond adhesive (Figure 3, right).Note: Cyanoacrylate glue as recommended by the manufacturer is preferred. However, if Vetbond is used, wait ~1 min after tissue block is attached for the glue to dry.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160911/20160911231841_2718.jpgFigure 3. Mounting LN/agarose block. Remove set agarose gel from well (left), trim with a razor blade into cuboid shape (middle) and mount the block on to the specimen holder with a small amount of glue (right).Mount the specimen holder onto vibratome for cutting. The LN should be aligned such that it is sectioned longitudinally as we find that tissue quality is better preserved (Figure 4).Set up the vibratome to ensure appropriate cutting speed and thickness. Typically, we use ~0.03 mm/s blade speed with ~1.6 mm amplitude, and ~200-250 μm thickness for best preservation of LN structural integrity.Begin with the vibratome blade just above the agarose surface, using brush as guide, and begin cutting via automated single or continuous sectioning. Discard the first slice.Transfer cut slices (with a No.5 forcep and soft bristled brush) into wells in a 96-well round-bottom plate filled with cold PBS, Figure 4. Take particular care to grip only the agarose part of the slice so as not to disrupt the LN tissue.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160911/20160911232008_5383.jpgFigure 4. Handling vibratome slices. Once an LN/agarose slice has been cut (left), use a pair of fine forceps and a brush to retrieve the slice from the buffer tray (middle) and leave it in cold PBS. For reference, the slice should appear relatively intact with minimal disruption to the tissue (right).",
    "Prepare a 96-well round-bottom plate for antibody staining by filling each row with reagents to be used in sequential steps for antibody staining (Figure 5): Row 1: Cold PBS (where LN slices are initially placed) Row 2: Protein blockRow 3: Primary antibodies (~70 μl per well)Row 4: PBS (Wash #1)Row 5: PBS (Wash #2)Row 6: Secondary antibodies (~70 μl per well)Row 7: PBS (Wash #1)Row 8: PBS (Wash #2)Transfer the LN slices down each column after each incubation step.Incubate in protein block for 1-2 h.Transfer into the well containing the primary antibodies (diluted in 2.5% NDS) and incubate at 4 °C for 8 h or overnight.Note: We have tested Pacific Blue-conjugated anti-B220 (dilution 1:200) and unconjugated anti-CD69 (dilution 1:50). It should be noted that each antibody batch should be individually titrated for optimal results.Transfer to the first wash buffer (PBS) well for 20-30 min, followed by the second well containing wash buffer (PBS).Transfer into the well containing the secondary antibodies (diluted in 2.5% NDS) and incubate at 4 °C for 8 h or overnight.Transfer to the first wash buffer (PBS) well for 20 min, followed by the second well containing wash buffer (PBS).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160911/20160911232132_9345.jpgFigure 5. Plate setup for antibody staining. Each well contains a LN slice that is transferred down each column for antibody labeling and washing steps.Place LN slices on glass microscope slides (up to 4 LN slices per slide). Arrange them in desired orientation.Use 5% gelatin/glycerol in PBS as mounting media and carefully place a coverslip over the tissues such that the edges are sealed.Slides are now ready for two-photon imaging:Acquisition parameters differ and are dependent upon the desired quality and fluorophore configuration (see Notes). In our experiments, we use: Zeiss LSM710 NLO with tunable Coherent Chameleon Ti:Sa laser Zeiss 20x/1.0 NA water immersion lens.",
    "Resolution: 512 x 512Slice interval: 2.5 μmZoom: ~1.5xDepth-adjusted correction for laser power and gain settings to reduce excessive laser excitation of the tissue, which can lead to photobleaching and phototoxicity.Whole LN cross-sections are acquired using the tile-scanning function of the Zeiss Zen software. An example is shown in Figure 6. Post-acquisition processing can be performed on dedicated image processing software (e.g., Bitplane Imaris) to allow quantitation of cells (Spots function) and export of statistics. Additionally, Imaris XTension functions or customized MATLAB script can be used for further analysis."
