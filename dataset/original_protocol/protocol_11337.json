    "Our IRB does not require review of this protocol. We receive discarded fresh glioblastoma tumor samples from the City of Hope Pathology Department that are coded, and our laboratory cannot gain access to the key. We receive the specimens with data only on prior treatment and disease state at the time of biopsy/resection, with no identifying data.\n1. Media Preparation\nPrepare neural stem cell media for culturing primary GBM cell lines: DMEM:F12, 1:50 B27, 5 µg/mL heparin, and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine; supplemented with 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF) and 20 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) twice a week (see Table of Materials).\nPrepare T cell media: X-VIVO 15 containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS); supplemented with 70 IU/mL rhIL-2 and 0.5 ng/mL rhIL-15 every 48 h (see Table of Materials).\nPrepare co-culture media: take neural stem cell media without EGF and FGF supplement, and add 10% FCS.\nPrepare FACS staining solution (FSS): HBSS, 2% FCS, NaN3 (0.5 g/500 mL).\n2. Preparation of GBM Tumor Cells\nHarvest low-passage GBM tumor spheres (TSs) by centrifugation at 300 x g for 4 min and discard supernatant.\nNOTE: GBM tumor spheres (TSs) are generated from resected tumors as described previously22,23,24, and maintained in neural stem cell media, in incubators with 5% CO2 at 37 °C.\nPre-warm co-culture media in a 37 °C water bath.\nAdd 1 mL of cold accutase to GBM TSs, dissociate TSs by pipetting for 30-60 s, and stop dissociation by adding 5 mL of warm co-culture media.\nNOTE: GBM TSs should not be kept on accutase for more than 5 min.\nHarvest GBM cells by centrifugation at 300 x g for 4 min, discard supernatant, and resuspend cells in 2 mL of co-culture media.\nDetermine cell concentration using a cell viability counter.\nNOTE: Cell viability must be >70%.",
    "3. Preparation of CAR T Cells\nLess than 24 h before the assay, take 100 µL of cultured CAR T cells into a flow cytometry tube and add 2 mL of FSS.\nNOTE: CAR T cells were generated as described previously11,21 and cultured in T cell media.\nCentrifugation at 300 x g for 4 min and discard supernatant.\nAdd 2 mL of FSS to wash the cells, centrifuge at 300 x g for 4 min, and discard supernatant.\nStain the cells with appropriate antibody to indicate CAR expression at 4 °C for 30 min.\nNOTE: For example, if an IL13Rα2-targeted CAR described previously25 is used, then stain with anti-IL13 antibody.\nWash twice with 2 mL of FSS and analyze CAR exn using a flow cytometer.\nDetermine the CAR% on T cells using the gating strategy shown in Figure 1B.\nAt the day of co-culture, harvest all CAR T cells by centrifugation at 300 x g for 4 min, discard supernatant, and resuspend cells in 2 mL of co-culture media.\nDetermine cell concentration using a cell viability counter.\nNOTE: Cell viability must be >70%.\n4. Set up tumor — T Cell Co-culture\nDilute tumor cells to a concentration of 0.16 million/mL with co-culture media.\nBased on CAR%, dilute CAR T cells to a concentration of 0.04 million CAR+ cells/mL with co-culture media.\nNOTE: For example, if the CAR is 50% and T cell concentration is 0.4 million/mL, then make a 1:5 dilution to get the final concentration of 0.04 million CAR+ cells/mL.\nPipette 100 µL of diluted tumor cells into each well of a 96-well flat-bottom tissue culture plate.\nPipette 100 µL of diluted CAR T cells into each well that contains tumor cells and mix well.",
    "NOTE: Each tumor-T cell co-culture will be analyzed at 4 time points. 4-6 replicates might be required at every time point based on different analysis, but <3 replicates per time point is not recommended; see Table 1 for a representative platemap.\nMaintain the plate in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator.\n5. Tumor Cell Rechallenge\nNOTE: Rechallenge takes place at 2, 4 and 6 days post the initial co-culture setup (Figure 1A).\nHarvest and dissociate GBM TSs as described above (Steps 2.1-2.6).\nResuspend GBM cells at a concentration of 0.64 million/mL.\nDetermine the co-culture wells that need rechallenge (see Table 1) and carefully remove 50 µL media from the top of each well.\nAdd 50 µL of GBM cell suspension into each well and mix well, then put the plate back into a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator.\n6. Harvest Samples and Flow Cytometric Analysis\nNOTE: Samples will be harvested at 1, 3, 5 and 7 days post the initial co-culture setup, with 1, 2, 3 and 4 rounds of tumor challenge, respectively.\nPre-warm 0.05% trypsin-EDTA solution in 37 °C waterbath.\nDetermine the wells that need harvesting and transfer the media into a new round-bottom 96-well plate.\nPipette 50 µL of trypsin-EDTA into the wells to digest remaining tumor cells at 37 °C for 5 min.\nUnder a microscope, confirm the cells have detached from the bottom.\nPipette around the well bottom to resuspend detached cells, then transfer trypsin-EDTA containing detached cells to the corresponding wells of the round-bottom 96-well plate.\nCentrifuge the round-bottom 96-well plate at 300 x g, 4 °C for 4 min, then discard supernatant.\nAdd 200 µL/well of FSS to wash the cells, centrifuge at 300 x g, 4 °C for 4 min, then discard supernatant.",
    "Resuspend cells in 100 µL/well FSS containing antibodies (see Table of Materials), and stain cells at 4 °C for 30 min.\nAdd 100 µL/well FSS to cells, centrifuge at 300 x g, 4 °C for 4 min, then discard supernatant.\nAdd 200 µL/well of FSS to wash the cells, centrifuge at 300 x g, 4 °C for 4 min, then discard supernatant.\nResuspend cells with 100-200 µL/well of FSS with 500 ng/mL DAPI, then analyze samples by flow cytometry.\n7. Functional and Phen Otypic Analysis of CAR T Cells\nRetrieve the data files from flow cytometer, and gate all live (DAPI-) cells (Figure 1C).\nQuantify tumor cells by gating the CD45- population and CAR T cells by gating the CD45+, CAR+ population (Figure 1C).\nNOTE: If the tumor cells express CD45 (e.g. Raji lymphoma cells), anti-CD3 staining can be used to differentiate T cells from tumor cells.\nPlot tumor cell and CAR T cell number through the time course.\nIdentify T cell activation by the co-expression of 4-1BB and CD69.\nNOTE: These surface markers can be used to analyze T cell activation 6-24 h post initial co-culture.\nIdentify T cell exhaustion by the expression of PD-1, LAG-3 and TIM-3.\nIdentify T cell memory status by the expression of CD45RO and CD62L."
