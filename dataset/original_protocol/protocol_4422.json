A glass capillary drawn by hand. Tip region was boxed. B. Tip opening of the glass capillary in panel A. C and D. A photo (C) and an image (D) of mannitol droplets inside the mineral oil over the siliconized coverslip. Bars = 1 cm in A and C, 200 μm in B.Sperm cell isolation and microscopic observation of sperm nuclear membraneOverlay the siliconized coverslip with 0.3 ml mineral oil and make several 1-2 μl mannitol droplets (370 mosmol/kg H2O) inside the mineral oil on the coverslip (Figure 1C) using a glass capillary connected to a handling injector. Take care that the droplets have no access to the air (Figure 1D).Dissect an unopened flower from the transgenic rice plants expressing SUN2-GFP to obtain anthers under a dissecting microscope (Figure 2A and B).Transfer anthers into a 3.5 cm plastic dishe filled with 3 ml of mannitol solution (370 mosmol/kg H2O). Break anthers in mannitol solution with forceps to free pollen grains (Figure 2C). Pollen grains burst due to the osmotic shock and release sperm cells. Identify the sperm cells under an inverted microscope (Figure 3A). By using a glass capillary connected to a handling injector, collect sperm cells and transfer into mannitol droplets prepared in step A1.SUN2-GFP localizing in nuclear membrane is visualized with an inverted fluorescence microscope with 460-490 nm excitation and 510-550 nm emission wavelengths (Figure 3B and C). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150402/20150402032006_2849.jpgFigure 2.

    "Arrows in panels B and C and arrowheads in panels C indicate anthers and pollen grains, respectively. Bars = 5 mm in A and B, 500 µm in C.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150402/20150402032034_3493.jpgFigure 3. Rice gametes expressing the SUN2-GFP or histone H2B-GFP fusion protein. A. A pollen grain expressing SUN2-GFP released its content in mannitol solution. B and C. Two sperm cells enclosed within the square in panel A were visualized under fluorescence microscopy. Panel C contains the merged bright-field and fluorescent images. D and E. An egg cell isolated from transgenic rice expressing histone H2B-RFP was visualized under bright-field (D) and fluorescence (E) microscopy. Arrow indicates a pollen grain releasing its content. Arrowheads in panels C and E indicate sperm nucleus and egg nucleus, respectively. Bars = 20 μmIn vitro fertilization with rice gametes and LSM observation of gamete nuclear membrane and nucleus in the fused gametes/zygotesOverlay the glass base dish with 0.2 ml mineral oil, and make a 1-2 μl mannitol droplet (450 mosmol/kg H2O) using a glass capillary connected with handling injector. Isolate egg cells from transgenic rice plants expressing H2B-RFP according to the previous protocol (Okamoto, 2011). By using a glass capillary connected to a handling injector, transfer an egg cell in a mannitol droplet on a coverslip prepared in step A1 (Figure 3D and E). Collect sperm cells expressing SUN2-GFP as described in step A, and transfer a sperm cell into a mannitol droplet with an egg cell from step B2.Electro-fuse the sperm cell and the egg cell in the droplet according the previous protocol (Okamoto, 2011). Briefly, an egg cell was fixed at one electrode under an alternating current field, and a sperm cell was aligned with the egg cell.",
    "Cell fusion is induced by applying a single negative direct current pulse, resulting in production of a fused gamete (zygote). Transfer the resultant zygote to a mannitol droplet on the glass base dish prepared in step B1. Observe the zygote under the LMS 710 CLS microscope using an oil immersion objective lens with 488-nm excitation and 505-530-nm emission wavelengths for SUN2-GFP and with 543-nm excitation and >560-nm emission wavelengths for H2B-RFP. Obtaining Z-stack serial images of sperm nuclei by LSM observations are described below.Image size: 1,024 pixel (X-axis) X 1,024 pixel (Y-axis), Digital zoom: 3.8 fold, Pinhole: 90 μm, Laser power (488-nm): 0.3%, Laser power (543-nm): 0.3%, Number of serial image (Z-axis): 12-16, Z-stack thickness: 0.6 μmimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150402/20150402032104_7850.jpgFigure 4.

    "Adjust the size of the 3D image for image manipulation (software operation: Edit-Crop 3D) (Figure 4B). Filter out noise signal from the 3D image created in step C2 (software operation: Image processing-Image smoothing).In the manual 3D construction mode (software operation: Surpass-Surface-Manual), generate an outline of sperm nucleus by spotting points on the SUN2-GFP labeled nuclear membrane for each Z-stack image (software operation: Draw-Contour-Mode- Click) (Figure 4C-E). Reconstruct the 3D image using the manually outlined sperm nucleus from step C4 (software operation: Create surface) (Figure 4E-F), and measure the volume of sperm cell nucleus (software operation: Imaris Maesurement Pro-Volume) (Figure 4F-G)."
