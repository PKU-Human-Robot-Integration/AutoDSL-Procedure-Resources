    "All steps within this protocol are according to the principles of the declaration of Helsinki.\n1. System Setup\nUsing a USB cable, connect the amplifier to the computer running the software and turn on the amplifier.\nConnect the hardware dongle to a free USB slot in the computer.\n\tNOTE: This is necessary to run the software.\nPut the antistatic wrist band onto the subject's wrist and connect it to a free power plug.\n\tNOTE: This band is designed to help ground the subject to the earth to reduce the noise that can influence the EEG quality.\nConnect the driver box with the USB cable to a free slot of the computer.\nConnect the trigger cable to the driver box as follows:\n\t\nConnect the \"g.STIMbox OUT 5\"-labeled connector to \"OUT 5\" of the driver box.\nConnect the \"g.STIMbox OUT 6\"-labeled connector to \"OUT 6\" of the driver box.\nConnect the \"g.STIMbox OUT 7\"-labeled connector to \"OUT 7\" of the driver box.\nConnect the \"g.USBamp DIO 1\"-labeled connector to the \"DIG I/O 1\" socket of the g.USBamp.\nConnect the three tactors to OUT 1, OUT 2, and OUT 3 of the driver box.\nConnect the \"TRIG OUT\"-labeled connector to the \"TRIG OUT\" socket of the audio trigger adapter box.\nTake adhesive tape and fix one tactor on the left wrist, another one on the right wrist, and a third one on the right ankle.\nConnect a male/male audio connector cable to the audio output of the computer and to the socket of the audio trigger adapter box that is labeled \"AUDIO IN.\" Turn on the audio trigger adapter box and check if the battery status LED is green.",
    "Start the software, observe a window called \"Add physician.\" Type the title, name, institution, and department into the empty fields. Click on \"Add\" to open another window.\nEnter the patient's name, city, country, birthdate, and check-in date into the window.\nClick the green \"+\" button below the blue arrow in the bottom-right section of the program. Enter the text \"First test\" into the \"Name\" field and \"Getting familiar with the software\" into the empty \"Details\" field.\n\tNOTE: It is necessary to enter information into all empty fields in order to proceed with the program.\nFinally, click on the \"Select this patient\" button.\nAttach 16 EEG channels to the subject's head using an electrode cap. Use the positions: FC3, FCz, FC4, C5, C3, C1, Cz, C2, C4, C6, CP3, CP1, CPz, CP2, CP4, and Pz according to the extended international 10-20 system14. Place a reference electrode on the right earlobe and a ground electrode on the forehead.\nTo properly position the cap on the subject's head, use a tape measure to measure the distance between the nasion and inion, as well as the distance between the left and right preauricular points. Ensure that the electrode in the vertex position, Cz, is at the midpoint of these two distances. Put on the electrode cap and align this measured position with the Cz position of the electrode cap. The electrode cap is now in the correct position.\nConnect the electrodes to the electrode connection box, following the setup described in step 1.12. Connect the electrode connection box to the biosignal amplifier and ensure that the amplifier and connection box are switched on.\nInject enough electrode gel into the electrodes to create a connection between the skin and the electrodes.\n2. Auditory P300 Assessment",
    "After entering the patient's information, click the \"Auditory P300\" button on the left side of the screen. Click the \"Assessment\" button on the bottom right to start the assessment run.\nCheck the signal quality of the EEG. The image with the brain on the right side of the screen provides a color-coded guide to the signal quality of each electrode, with red for bad signal quality, yellow for acceptable signal quality, and green for good signal quality.\nOpen the settings menu via the settings button and confirm that auditory beeps can be heard. Present these beeps with two different frequencies to the subject and explain the task, which is to count each of the high-frequency beeps.\nPut the earphones into the user's ears and click the start button.\nAfter the assessment run finishes, check the results page and the accuracy plot (Figures 1 & 2). If the accuracy level is below 40%, repeat the run.\n\tNOTE: If the subject's accuracy is below 40%, then reliable communication is unlikely, at least with that paradigm and recording session. Nevertheless, assessments with other approaches and/or at different times could yield different results.\n3. Vibrotactile P300 Assessment with 2 Stimulators\nClick the \"Vibrotactile 2 Tactor\" button on the left side of the screen; then, click the \"Assessment\" button on the bottom right to start the assessment run. Repeat step 2.2.\nOpen the settings menu via the settings button to confirm that the vibrations of the tactors can be felt. Instruct the subject that he/she will feel vibrations on the left and right wrists. The task is to count the number of vibration stimuli on the left wrist. After the instructions, click the start button.",
    "When the assessment run has finished, check the results page and the accuracy plot. If the accuracy level is below 40%, repeat the run.\n\tNOTE: If the subject's accuracy is below 40%, then reliable communication is unlikely, at least with that paradigm and recording session. Nevertheless, assessments with other approaches and/or at different times could yield different results.\n4. Vibrotactile P300 Assessment with 3 Stimulators\nClick the button \"Vibrotactile 3 Tactor\" button on the left side of the screen and then click the \"Assessment\" button on the bottom right to start the assessment run.\nRepeat step 2.2. Open the settings menu via the settings button to confirm that the vibrations of the tactors can be felt.\nInstruct the subject that he/she will feel vibrations on the left and right wrists and on the right ankle and will hear the command \"LEFT\" or \"RIGHT\" via the headphones. Ask the subject to count the stimuli on the selected hand until the next command appears or the run is over.\n\tNOTE: \"LEFT\" means that the subject should count the vibration stimuli on the left side, while the \"RIGHT\" instructs the subject to count the stimuli on the right wrist.\nPlug the earphones into the subject's ears and click the start button.\nAfter finishing the assessment run, check the results page and the accuracy plot. If the accuracy level is below 40%, repeat the run.\n\tNOTE: If the subject's accuracy is below 40%, then reliable communication is unlikely, at least with that paradigm and recording session. Nevertheless, assessments with other approaches and/or at different times could yield different results.\n5. Vibrotactile P300 Communication with 3 Stimulators\nClick the \"Vibrotactile 3 Tactor\" button on the left side of the screen. Click the \"Communication\" button on the bottom to start the communication run.",
    "Repeat step 2.2. Open the settings menu via the settings button and confirm that the vibrations of the tactors can be felt. In the settings menu, select the classifier with the highest accuracy level. This is usually the classifier with the highest accuracy level as determined by the system.\nInstruct the subject that he/she will feel vibrations on the left and right wrists and on the right ankle. Instruct the subject that he/she will hear a question and is supposed to answer either \"YES\" or \"NO.\" To answer \"YES,\" ask the subject to count the stimuli on the left hand; to answer \"NO,\" ask the subject to count the stimuli on the right hand.\nAsk the patient a question that could be answered with either \"YES\" or \"NO.\" After that, click the \"Start new question\" button.\n\tNOTE: When the sequence has finished, the software presents the answer. It could be \"YES,\" \"NO,\" or no answer (if the software was unable to accurately detect the brain patterns).\n6. MI assessment\nClick the \"Motor Imagery\" button on the left side of the screen. Click the \"Assessment\" button on the bottom right to start the assessment run.\nRepeat step 2.2. Open the settings menu via the settings button and confirm that the audio commands can be heard via the earphones.\nInstruct the subject that he/she will hear a beep, followed by a command saying either \"LEFT\" or \"RIGHT.\" Instruct the subject to try squeezing a ball with the left hand after the command \"LEFT\" and squeezing a ball with the right hand after the command \"RIGHT.\" Ask the subject to stop imagining the squeezing as soon as the subject hears the command \"RELAX.\"\n\tNOTE: In total, 60 commands in randomized order will be played.",
    "Have the run last for 8 min. Click the pause button after about 4 min, wait for about 1 min, and continue the run.\n\tNOTE: The pause is designed to help the subject maintain concentration throughout the run.\nAfter the assessment, check the results page and the accuracy plot ( Figures 3 and 4).\n\tNOTE: If the accuracy level is below the significance level, repeat the run. If the accuracy remains below this significance level, then reliable communication is unlikely, at least with that paradigm and recording session. Nevertheless, assessments with other approaches and/or at different times could yield different results.\n7. MI Communication\nClick the \"Motor Imagery\" button on the left side of the screen. Click the \"Communication\" button on the bottom left to start the communication run. Repeat step 2.2.\nOpen the settings menu with the setting button and select the classifier with the highest classification accuracy.\nInstruct the subject my saying that after the beep he/she can provide an answer to the question that was asked previously. To say \"YES,\" ask the patient to imagine squeezing a ball with the left hand. To say \"NO,\" the patient should imagine squeezing a ball with the right hand.\nAsk the patient a question that could be answered with either \"YES\" or \"NO.\" After that, click the \"Start new question\" button.\n\tNOTE: When the sequence has finished, the software presents the answer (Figure 5). It could be either \"YES\" or \"NO.\""
