    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe protocol was established in HEK293T and HeLa cells overexpressing H2B-mCherry and GFP-cGAS fluorescent proteins. These cell lines should be used for best results. If other parental cell lines are used (either another parental cell line or other fluorescent proteins), the protocol should be adapted at each step, as indicated below.\nCell culture\nTiming: 3–4 days\nIn the next steps, the cell culture steps necessary for the preparation of the samples are described in detail.\nSeed the cells overexpressing H2B-mCherry and GFP-cGAS fluorescent proteins 24 h before drug treatment at desired density on an appropriate container (i.e., 3–10 of 245 × 245 × 25 mm dishes; 2.5 × 107 cells per dish).\nFor control samples, seed 2 dishes of parental cells, as well as cells overexpressing only H2B-mCherry (1 dish per cell line), 24 h before drug treatment at desired density on an appropriate container (1–2 × 2.5 × 107 cells per sample in a 245 × 245 × 25 mm dish).\nNote: The final volume of media contained in the 245 × 245 × 25 mm dishes should be 80 mL per dish for ideal cell growth.\nCritical: 2–6 × 108 cells are typically necessary to isolate sufficient micronuclei for most downstream applications. However, culturing more than 10 × 245 × 245 × 25 mm dishes of cells at once is not advised, as it will significantly increase the time for sample preparation and sorting.\nDrug treatment\nTiming: 1–2 days\nIn the next steps, drug treatment with an Mps1 inhibitor is described in detail.\nTreat all cultured cells (except one dish of parental cells) with the Mps1 inhibitor Reversine at the final concentration of 0.5 μM (1:10,000 dilution of the stock solution).",
    "Note: Other chemical inhibitors of Mps1, such as AZ3146 or BAY-1217389, or spindle poisons, such as nocodazole or taxol, can also be used to perturb chromosome segregation during mitosis and induce micronuclei formation.\nCulture cells at 37°C for 24–48 h.\nNote: The duration of the drug treatment with Reversine has been adapted for high levels of micronuclei accumulation in HEK293T (48 h culture post-treatment) or HeLa cells (24 h culture post-treatment). If different parental cells are used, or if a milder induction of micronuclei is desired, the appropriate duration of the treatment should be established in advance by microscopy of DAPI stained cells.\nNote: The drug treatment induces the formation of a high number of micronuclei (1–6 micronuclei per cell), which is necessary to increase the yield of the experiment. If no drug treatment is used, the yield of the experiment will be significantly reduced.\nCritical: Drug treatment will partially affect cell growth and can lead to cell death. Use a higher seeding density to avoid major cell loss. If parental cells other that HEK293T or HeLa cells are used, cell viability after drug treatment and seeding density should be established in advance.\nCell samples collection\nTiming: 1–3 h\nIn the next steps, the collection of samples from cultured cells is described in detail.\nHarvest the cultured cells (cell lines expressing the fluorescent proteins H2B-mCherry and GFP-cGAS ± drug treatment; control cells ± drug treatment) in 50 mL conical tubes.\nWash cells with 30 mL PBS 1× per cell culture dish.\nAdd 20 mL of pre-warmed (37°C) Trypsin per cell culture dish.\nNote: The cells will not detach easily and form more aggregates if the volume of Trypsin used in the 245 × 245 × 25 mm dishes is lower than 20 mL.",
    "Incubate the dishes at 37°C for 10 min to enhance Trypsin activity.\nAfter 10 min, verify that the cells are detached from the dish using a microscope. If the cells are not detached and/or form aggregates, place the dish back at 37°C and incubate for 2–5 min more.\nAdd 10 mL of pre-warmed (37°C) fresh culture medium and collect the cells in a 50 mL conical tube. Use one 50 mL conical tube per culture dish.\nWash the dish with an additional 10 mL of fresh culture medium and add this volume to the conical tube.\nNote: If working with more than 5 culture dishes, process in batches of 1–5 dishes at a time, to avoid prolonged incubation in Trypsin.\nCollect a sample of trypsinized cells (one for each cell line ± drug treatment) for cell counting.\nNote: We use the Beckman Z1 Coulter Particle Counter to count the cells.\nCritical: Accurate estimates of the cell number in each sample is essential. See Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] (quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis]) to determine how to process the samples in the next steps of the experiment.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_516_7.csv\nCentrifuge the harvested cells at 300 × g for 5 min (at 20°C–25°C).\nDiscard the supernatant and keep the pelleted cells in the 50 mL conical tube.\nWash the pellet in fresh culture medium without FBS (first wash).\nResuspend the cell pellet in 2 mL of fresh culture medium using a 1000 μL pipette tip.\nAdd fresh culture medium without serum to reach the washing buffer volume indicated in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] (quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis]).\nNote: If one cell sample has been collected in several conical tubes, the cell pellets can be pooled before resuspension in the final volume of culture medium without serum.\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 × g for 5 min (at 20°C–25°C).",
    "Discard the first wash and keep the pellet in the conical tube.\nWash the pellet in fresh culture medium without FBS (second wash).\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 × g for 5 min (at 20°C–25°C).\nDiscard the second wash and keep the pellet in the conical tube.\nResuspend the cell pellet in pre-warmed (37°C) culture medium without FBS supplemented with cytochalasin B (final concentration of 10 μg/mL). Cytochalasin B is used to help facilitate separation of micronuclei from nuclei.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of fresh culture medium supplemented with Cytochalasin B using a 1000 μL pipette tip before adding the rest of the medium to reach the final desired volume (See Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]; quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis]).\nIncubate the cells in the medium supplemented with Cytochalasin B for 30 min at 37°C.\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 × g for 5 min (at 4°C).\nNote: Cytochalasin B is an actin polymerization inhibitor which helps efficiently dissociate the micronuclei from their primary nuclei prior and during cell lysis (Shimizu et al., 1996[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nCell lysis\nTiming: 30–60 min\nIn the next steps, lysis of the collected cell samples is described in detail.\nCritical: From step 18 onward all work should be performed on ice.\nPlace the conical tubes containing the pelleted samples on ice.\nDiscard the culture medium supplemented with Cytochalasin B and keep the cell pellet on ice.\nResuspend the cell pellet in ice-cold lysis buffer.\nResuspend the cell pellet using a 5 mL pipette with lysis buffer by gently pipetting up and down 5 times.\nAdd additional volume of lysis buffer to reach the final volume of solution (See Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]; quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis]).\nTransfer the cell lysate into a Dounce-homogenizer.\nGently Dounce-homogenize the sample by using a loose-fitting pestle (10 strokes).",
    "Transfer the cell lysate back into the 50 mL conical tube.\nOptional verification step: Homogenize the lysate. Collect 50 μL of the lysate and mix with an equal volume of PBS 1× + 0.5 μg/mL of DAPI. Examine the sample under a fluorescence microscope. The primary nuclei and micronuclei should be released from other cellular compartments and the micronuclei and primary nuclei should be separated from each other (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A; troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/516-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Verification steps of the micronuclei purification protocol\n(A) Immunofluorescence for GFP (cGAS) and DAPI staining of the lysate obtained after the lysis and Dounce homogenization of cells. Scale bar, 25 μm.\n(B) Immunofluorescence for GFP (cGAS) and DAPI staining of the different fractions obtained after the centrifugation of the cell lysate on the sucrose gradient. Fraction 1, cell debris; fraction 2, micronuclei; fraction 3, primary nuclei. Scale bar, 25 μm. Red arrows indicate intact micronuclei (GFP-cGAS-negative). Green arrows indicate ruptured micronuclei (GFP-cGAS-positive).\nMix the cell lysate with an equal volume of Sucrose 1.8 M Buffer: [Lysate 1:1 Sucrose].\nSucrose density gradient\nTiming: 30–45 min\nIn the next steps, the processing of the cell lysates through the sucrose density gradient is described in detail.\nPrepare the sucrose density gradient (Sucrose Density Gradient Preparation) in a 50 mL conical tube.\nNote: One sucrose density gradient (in a 50 mL conical tube) is sufficient to process 10 mL of the mixture [Lysate 1:1 Sucrose] prepared in step 24. Prepare as many sucrose density gradient tubes as necessary to process all of the sample.\nCritical: Never invert the conical tube containing the sucrose density gradient to avoid disturbing the gradient.\nSlowly pipette 10 mL of the mixture [Lysate 1:1 Sucrose 1.8 M Buffer] on top of the 2-layered Sucrose Density Gradient.",
    "Centrifuge the samples in a JS-5.3 swinging bucket rotor at 944 × g for 20 min at 4°C.\nCollect the following fractions (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B): - Fraction 1 = upper 2 mL (cell debris) - Fraction 2 = following 5 mL (micronuclei) - Fraction 3 = following 38 mL (primary nuclei)\nDiscard fractions 1 and 3.\nTransfer Fraction 2, containing the micronuclei, to a new 50 mL conical tube.\nKeep the new conical tube on ice.\nOptional verification step: Before discarding any fraction, collect 50 μL of each fraction and mix it to an equal volume of PBS 1× + 0.5 μg/mL of DAPI. Examine the samples under a fluorescence microscope. Fraction 1 should contain very small particles and some micronuclei. Fraction 2 should contain micronuclei and some small primary nuclei (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B; troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]). Micronuclei should be separate from primary nuclei. Fraction 3 should contain primary nuclei, as well as aggregates of nuclei and large cell debris.\nNote: The fraction volumes described above are optimal for samples made using a sucrose density gradient of 35 mL (15 mL Sucrose 1.6 M Buffer + 20 mL Sucrose 1.8 M Buffer) and 10 mL of mixture [Lysate 1:1 Sucrose]. If one of the sucrose density gradients used in the experiment has different proportions, the volumes of the fractions should be adapted accordingly.\nMicronuclei sample preparation\nTiming: 30–45 min\nIn the next steps, the preparation of micronuclei before flow cytometry sorting is described in detail.\nDilute fraction 2 1:5 with ice-cold supplemented PBS 1×.\nCentrifuge the samples in a JS-5.3 swinging bucket rotor at 944 × g for 20 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant carefully but leave around 500 μL of buffer with the pellet.\nNote: The pellet should be visible.",
    "Critical: Do not invert the conical tube when discarding the supernatant to avoid losing the micronuclei pellet. Similarly, strong aspiration should be avoided. We prefer using a 10 mL pipette and a pipette controller to discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the micronuclei pellet in ice-cold supplemented PBS 1× containing 2 μg/mL DAPI. (See Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nResuspend the pellet using a 1000 μL pipette tip by gently pipetting up and down 5 times.\nFilter the samples through a 40 μm ministrainer into FACS tubes.\nDo not force the passage of the sample through the filter. Forcing sample through the filter can damage micronuclei or result in delays during flow sorting.\nAlternatives: Filters with a size range between 20 μm and 40 μm can be used with similar results. However, filters classically used for flow cytometry cell sorting (which are larger than 40 μm) should be avoided.\nKeep filtered samples on ice in the dark.\nCritical: Micronuclei samples should be sorted by flow cytometry (see following steps) as soon as possible. Delays may result in a need for samples to be re-filtered.\nFlow cytometry sorting\nTiming: 2–6 h\nIn the next steps, the sorting of the different sub-populations of micronuclei is described in detail.\nSort the desired samples with a BD FACSAria III Cell Sorter (Flow Cytometry Sorting Setup).\nUse the control samples to draw the gates of total, intact, and ruptured micronuclei. Draw an additional gate for primary nuclei if desired (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nWash the system by running water between each sample for 1 min.\nAdd ice-cold supplemented PBS 1× in the collection tubes before collecting the samples and invert the tubes as many times as necessary to coat the interior of the tubes with the buffer.",
    "Note: We typically use 1.5 mL conical tubes for downstream immunofluorescence applications and 15 mL conical tubes for downstream immunoblotting applications.\nInvert the sample FACS tubes 5 times to homogenize the sample.\nCritical: Never vortex the tubes containing nuclei and/or micronuclei samples to prevent irreversible damage to the samples.\nSort the desired gates at a flow rate 1,500–3,000 events/s, mode 4-way purity.\nNote: A flow rate faster than 3,000 events/s can lead to increased risk of error during sorting.\nNote: The 4-way purity mode is slower than the other sorting modes available, but it will sort samples with the lowest error rate.\nPut the collection tubes on ice after sorting until further processing.\nNote: The sorting of ruptured micronuclei can take up to several hours if the number of micronuclei desired is high and/or if the samples contain low levels of micronuclei.\nProcessing of sorted samples\nTiming: 30–90 min\nIn the next steps, the processing of the sorted micronuclei is described in detail.\nSorted samples can be processed differently according to further applications:\nImmunofluorescence:\nCollect 300,000 micronuclei (or 100,000 primary nuclei) in 1.5 mL low-binding collection tubes.\nNote: 300,000 micronuclei are the ideal number of micronuclei to sort in order to have a concentrated sample to image by microscopy. However, the immunofluorescence can be performed on less micronuclei (150,000 minimum).\nFix the samples with PFA: add the appropriate volume of PFA 16% to the sample tube to reach a final concentration of 2%–4%.\nInvert the tubes 5 times and incubate at 20°C–25°C for 15 min.\nTransfer the tubes into cytospin funnels (1 funnel can contain up to 500 μL).\nCytospin the samples onto microscopy slides at 1000 rpm for 10 min at 20°C–25°C (see manufacturer’s instruction for using the Cytospin).",
    "Let the slides air-dry at 20°C–25°C for at least 15 h and then perform immunofluorescence.\nWestern blotting, mass spectrometry, DNA extraction:\nCollect the samples in 15 mL conical tubes: collect 500,000 micronuclei per protein sample for western blotting; 2–3,000,000 micronuclei per protein sample for proteomic analysis; 500,000–2,000,000 micronuclei per DNA sample.\nAdd BSA (final concentration 0.03%) and NP-40 (final concentration 0.1%) to the samples.\nCentrifuge in a JS-5.3 swinging bucket rotor at max speed for 20 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant carefully and keep the pellet which should be visible.\nCritical: Do not invert the tubes or use aspiration to discard the supernatant after centrifugation. Use pipettes only and avoid disturbing the pellet.\nResuspend the pellet in 500 μL ice-cold supplemented PBS 1× buffer and transfer into a 1.5 mL low-binding tube.\nCentrifuge at max speed for 20 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant carefully and keep the pellet.\nCritical: If the pellet is not visible, do not discard the supernatant and add BSA. Then, Centrifuge the sample again for 20 min (troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nStore the pellets at −80°C until performing the functional assay.\nPause Point: Functional assays can be performed 1 day to several months after storing the samples at −80°C, or cytospining on a microscopy slide.\nFunctional assay example: immunoblotting\nTiming: 2 days\nIn the next steps, the quantitative immunoblotting of the sorted micronuclei is described in detail.\nThaw micronuclei samples on ice.\nLyse samples in 1× Laemmli buffer at 2.5 × 106 micronuclei/μL.\nDenature the lysates at 95°C for 5 min.\nSonicate the samples using a Bioruptor 300 on the high intensity setting for 8 cycles 30 s ON/30 s OFF.\nAlternatives: If sonication is not available the DNA can be sheared using a 1 mL syringe until the lysate is no longer viscous.",
    "Lysate from 0.5 × 106 micronuclei can be loaded in each lane of a polyacrylamide gel, resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes.\nNote: We omit protein quantification after lysis and sonication to avoid loss of sample.\nAlternatives: Protein extraction followed by BCA (bicinchoninic acid) assay can be performed to quantify the protein concentration. However, the BCA assay is not very sensitive and requires high volumes of micronuclei samples to detect proteins.\nNote: We recommend using a pre-cast gradient 8%–16% gel to maximize the separation of proteins in order to detect the highest number of immunoblotting targets on the membrane.\nBlock the membranes in Odyssey blocking buffer in TBS (for Li-COR immunoblotting).\nDilute primary antibodies in blocking buffer supplemented with 0.2% Tween and incubated with membranes for at least 15 h at 4°C.\nWash the membranes in TBS supplemented with Tween 0.5% (TBS-T) 3 × 5 min.\nUse secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 680 and 800) at 1:10,000 dilutions in blocking buffer supplemented with 0.2% Tween and incubated with membranes for 1 h at 20°C–25°C.\nWash the membranes in TBS supplemented with Tween 0.5% (TBS-T) 3 × 5 min.\nWash the membranes one additional time in TBS buffer without Tween for 5 min.\nDry the membranes before imaging.\nMeasure fluorescence using an infrared imaging scanner (Odyssey; LI-COR) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nAlternatives: Non-quantitative immunoblotting can be performed. Membranes are blocked in TBS-T and milk 5% solution. The primary antibodies and the horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies are diluted in TBS-T. Imaging of the membranes is performed using enhanced chemiluminescence."
