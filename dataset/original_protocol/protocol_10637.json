    "1. PEDOT:PSS Solution Preparation\nTo 50 ml of PEDOT:PSS, add ethylene glycol (increases conductivity) in a volume ratio of 1:4 (ethylene glycol to PEDOT:PSS), 0.5 μl/ml of Dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA) as a surfactant, and 10 mg/ml 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GOPS) as a cross-linker to promote adhesion of the conducting polymer to the glass slide.\n2. OECT Fabrication (Figure 3)\nDefine thermally evaporated gold source and drain contacts via lift-off lithography:\n\t\nSpin coat photoresist on a normal clean glass slide at 3,000 rpm for 30 sec. Glass dimensions are 3 in x 1 in.\nDefine patterns by photolithography. Dimensions may be altered, however the dimensions listed here were shown to lead to the optimal sensitivity. Then use a developer.\nEvaporate 5 nm and 100 nm of chromium and gold, respectively.\nLift-off the photoresist in an acetone bath for 1 hr, leaving the substrate with the source and drain Au contacts area only.\nThe desired length of the PEDOT:PSS channel is 1 mm. This is achieved by patterning using a parylene-C (Pa-C) peel-off technique:\n\t\nLoad 3.5 g of Pa-C in the coating setup. Uniformly evaporate 2 µm of parylene-C on top of the substrate with Au contacts.\nPattern the channel by photolithography:\n\t\t\nSpin coat photoresist at 3,000 rpm for 30 sec.\nUse a mask to illuminate channel and gold contact 20 sec to UV, the exposed photoresist will become soluble in the developer.\nUse developer to open the channel area on the photoresist.\nEtch the Pa-C in the channel area by a 15 min plasma step (O2 (50 sccm) and CHF4 (3 sccm) plasma at 160 W) in order to open the channel and the gold contact.\nDeposit the PEDOT:PSS mixture solution by spin coating at 500 rpm for 45 sec. Bake for 30 sec at 110 °C.",
    "Peel-off the Pa-C to reveal the PEDOT:PSS channel of the substrate underneath. This channel should slightly overlap with the Au contacts made in Protocol 1.\nBake samples for 1 hr at 140 °C under atmospheric conditions.\n3. Device Assembly\nMake PDMS by mixing two solutions (usually supplied together in a kit) at a ratio 1:10 of curing solution in base solution. Bake it for 1 hr at 120 °C.\nDesign well by using a hole punch and cut a square around the desired area.\nGlue a PDMS well on top of the channel, to result in a channel area of approximately 6 mm2. Ensure that the source and drain contacts are not covered.\nMake a plastic support with a hole in it (can use the holder for the cell culture insert) and then glue it on top of the PDMS. Let it dry overnight.\nTest the well for leaking by prefilling with water.\nSolder electric wires on the source and drain contact with tin.\n4. Cell Culture\nPrepare cell culture media as follows:\n\t\nIn DMEM, add 1% Glutamine, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 0.5% Penicillin-streptomycin, and 0.1% Gentamicin.\nSterilize the cell culture media using a sterile filter device.\nMaintain Caco-2 cells between passage 49 and 68 at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, in cell culture media.\nDivide cells once a week using trypsin and seed at 1.5 x 104 cells/insert.\nChange cell culture media twice a week over 3 weeks.\n5. Measurements with OECT\nConnect an Ag/AgCl wire to a sourcemeter for use as the gate electrode. Immerse the tip in cell culture media, which is used as the electrolyte, as illustrated in Figure 1a.\nConnect wires from source and drain to the sourcemeter (dual channel setup).",
    "Apply a square pulse positive voltage (VGS) between the gate and the source (used as reference electrode: ground). A negative constant voltage between drain and source (VDS) is applied and corresponding current (IDS) is measured.\nUse a PC running program data collection. OECT parameters entered in a customized acquisition program should be as follows: VDS = -0.2 V, VGS = 0.3 V, VGS on time = 2 sec, off time = 28 sec.\nRead out source-drain current (IDS) and gate current (IGS). Carry out the measurement for several minutes to ensure a stable baseline signal.\n6. Integrating Cells with OECT for Measurement\nNote: Prior to the experiment, the integrity of the cell layer may be verified by measuring TER with an Impedance spectroscopy device. TER of each 3-week old Caco-2 cell insert should be above 400 Ω.cm2.\nDuring off time of OECT measurement: Remove the gate electrode from the electrolyte, incorporate the cell culture insert, and replace the gate electrode inside the cell culture insert.\nCarry out a baseline measurement with the cells for several minutes to ensure a stable signal. This baseline will be used as for calculation of the normalized value corresponding to an intact monolayer (0).\n7. Preparation and Introduction of Toxic Compound\nPrepare a 1 M solution of EGTA in DI water, first adjusting the pH of the solution to 7.4 with Tris base.\nAdd EGTA solution in the appropriate volume to obtain the desired concentration (e.g. between 5 mM and 100 mM) taking into account the volume. The EGTA should be added in the basal chamber during the off time.\nMeasure continuously for 90 min as in Protocol 5. If the measurement is being carried out at room temperature, the stability of the cells will not remain constant after 90 min.",
    "At the end of the run, scratch the cell layer to result in a complete destruction of the barrier layer and measure for 15 min, this point could be done by removing the filter and immersing the gate electrode in the media. This baseline will be used as for calculation of the normalized value corresponding to a destroyed monolayer.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
