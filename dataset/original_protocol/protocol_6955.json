    "Growing tomato plantsGerminate tomato seeds (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Moneymaker) in a 1:2 mixture of standard potting soil and vermiculite. Grow seedlings for one week in a growth chamber (25°C, 16 h light/8 h dark photoperiod, 130 mE m-2 s-1, 65% humidity) (Figure 1A).Soak Jiffy pots thoroughly with tap water without fertilizer (an excess of fertilizer may cause stress to the tomato seedlings) (see Note 1). Transfer tomato seedlings to individual water-soaked jiffy pots containing a pre-packed soil mixture (Figure 1B) (see Note 1). Grow tomato plants in the same growth chamber for another three weeks (Figure 1C) (see Note 2). Approximately 6-8 plants per treatment are recommended to obtain robust results.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4134/bioprotoc-11-16-4134-g001.jpgFigure 1. Growth of tomato seedlings in Jiffy pots. A. Germination of tomato seeds (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Moneymaker) in a 1:2 mixture of standard potting soil and vermiculite. B. Transferring tomato seedlings to individual water-soaked jiffy pots containing a pre-packed soil mixture. C. Four-week-old tomato plants ready for Ralstonia inoculation.Preparation of R. solanacearum inoculumPrepare solid and liquid phi medium (see Recipes) following standard procedures (Yu and Macho, 2021).Streak out R. solanacearum strains on solid phi medium plates containing TTC and glucose (see Recipes; Yu and Macho, 2021) and prepare a bacterial suspension as previously described (Yu and Macho, 2021).Dilute the final bacterial suspension in distilled water to an OD600 = 0.1, which corresponds to approximately 108 CFU/ml (Morel et al., 2018). Perform serial dilutions of the bacterial suspension using distilled water to reach 106 CFU/ml in a volume of 1 ml in a sterile 2-ml microcentrifuge tube (see Note 3) (Figure 2). Consider the possibility of testing the virulence of different doses of your specific strains under your specific experimental conditions.",
    "Under our conditions, we selected 106 CFU/ml as a suitable concentration to allow gradual but reproducible bacterial replication inside tomato stems during the first 3 days post-inoculation (dpi) without causing the development of necrotic symptoms during the experiment (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4134/bioprotoc-11-16-4134-g002.jpgFigure 2. Preparation of R. solanacearum inoculum Inoculation (stem injection) and sampling of xylem sapUsing a 10-μl microsyringe, inject 5 μl bacterial suspension into the stems of 4-week-old tomato plants (see Note 4). The inoculation site should be approximately 2 cm below the cotyledon emergence site (Figure 3A and 3B). When performing stem injection, use an angle of approximately 30° between the syringe and the stem to facilitate injection of the bacterial suspension.Place the inoculated tomato plants in a growth chamber (28°C, 12 h light/12 h dark, 130 mE m-2 s-1, 75% humidity) for 36-72 h until subsequent sampling at the appropriate time points.Transect the stem with a sterile scalpel just below the cotyledon emergence site (Figure 3C).Using two fingers, gently squeeze the lower part of the tomato stem to allow the xylem sap to emerge and then collect 2.5 μl xylem sap using a 2.5-μl pipette (see Note 5) (Figure 3D).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4134/bioprotoc-11-16-4134-g003.jpgFigure 3. Stem injection and sampling of xylem sap. A. Four-week-old tomato plants in Jiffy pots. B. Using a 10-μl microsyringe, inject 5 μl bacterial suspension into the stems of 4-week-old tomato plants. C. Transect the tomato stems with a sterile scalpel just below the cotyledon emergence site. D. Collect 2.5 μl xylem sap at the cutting site using a micropipette.Bacterial quantitationDissolve the xylem sap in 1 ml sterile water in a sterile 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube (Figure 4A).Dilute and spread bacteria (50 μl) on phi medium plates using standard procedures, as previously described (Yu and Macho, 2021).",
    "Spreading can be performed manually using a sterile spreader, plastic beads, or the bottom of a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, or using a spiral plater (Yu and Macho, 2021).Incubate the plates upright at 28°C for 2 days. Count the colonies and process the data (Figure 4B) (see Note 6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4134/bioprotoc-11-16-4134-g004.jpgFigure 4. Preparation of serial dilutions and bacterial spreading. A. Dissolve the xylem sap containing Ralstonia in 1 ml sterile water in a sterile 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube; dilute the suspensions by 10 to 104 times. B. Spread the diluted bacterial suspensions (we tried to spread 10-1 or 10-3) on phi medium plates using standard procedures, as previously described (Yu and Macho, 2021). Incubate the plates upright at 28°C for 2 days and count the colonies on solid phi medium plates. Photos in B show the usual colony pattern after plating using a spiral plater (Yu and Macho, 2021)."
