  "procedures": [
    "All animal procedures were performed according to Directive 2010/63/EU. The procedures were approved by the institutional Animal Welfare Body, licensed by DGAV, the Portuguese competent authority for animal protection (license number 0421/000/000/2021). Male Wistar Han IGS (Crl:WI(Han) rats (400-500 g) at 12-14 weeks of age were used for the present study. The animals were obtained from a commercial source (see Table of Materials).\n1. Preparation of solutions\nAnesthetic solution\n\t\nFill a 3 mL syringe with 2.3 mL of medetomidine (1 mg/mL; 0.715 mg/kg body weight) and transfer to a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nFill a 3 mL syringe with 1.55 mL of fentanyl (0.05 mg/mL; 0.02 mg/kg body weight) and transfer to the same 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nFill a 10 mL syringe with 6.15 mL of midazolam (5 mg/mL; 9.5 mg/kg body weight) and transfer to the same 15 mL centrifuge tube, thus making a 10 mL anesthetic solution.\nLabel the tube and store it at 4 °C in the dark.\n\t\tNOTE: This anesthetic combination (medetomidine, fentanyl, and midazolam) provides an up to 3 h anesthetic surgical window. The administration of atipamezole and flumazenil may revert the effect.\nAnti-sedative solution\n\t\nFill a 1 mL syringe with 0.7 mL of atipamezole (5 mg/mL; 3.72 mg/kg body weight) and transfer to a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nFill a 10 mL syringe with 9.3 mL of flumazenil (0.1 mg/mL; 1.56 mg/kg body weight) and transfer to the same 15 mL centrifuge tube, thus making a 10 mL anti-sedative solution.\nLabel the tube and store it at 4 °C in the dark.\nPostoperative analgesia solutions\n\t\nFill a 1 mL syringe with 0.5 mL of carprofen (50 mg/mL; 5 mg/kg body weight) and transfer to a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nAdd 9.5 mL of NaCl solution (0.9%), obtaining a 10 mL carprofen solution.",
    "Fill a 1 mL syringe with 1 mL of buprenorphine (0.3 mg/mL; 0.01-0.05 mg/kg body weight) and transfer to a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nAdd 9 mL of NaCl solution (0.9%), obtaining a 10 mL buprenorphine solution.\nLabel the tubes and store them at 4 °C in the dark.\nPerioperative antibiotic\n\t\nFill a 2.5 mL syringe with 2.5 mL of enrofloxacin (25 mg/mL; 10 mg/kg body weight) and transfer to a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nAdd 7.5 mL of NaCl solution (0.9%), obtaining a 10 mL enrofloxacin solution.\nLabel the tube and store it at 4 °C in the dark.\n\t\t​NOTE: The details of all the reagents to prepare the above solutions are listed in the Table of Materials.\n2. Surgical induction of urethral stricture\nNOTE: The surgical procedures were performed using a stereo microscope (10x) (see Table of Materials).\nSterilize all surgical tools before use: scalpel blade (number 11), pointed forceps, spring scissors, surgical forceps, ophthalmic needle holder, surgical scissors, and a needle holder. Use sterile cotton balls to clean the surgical field.\nLoad the syringe with the anesthetic solution before holding the rat.\nRestrain the animal using a tube or a towel and elevate the tail to expose the abdomen.\nKeep the animal restrained and perform an intraperitoneal injection of the anesthetic solution (prepared in step 1.1).\nTest the rat's pedal withdrawal reflexes to assess anesthesia.\nApply protective eye gel in both eyes of the animal. Perform a subcutaneous injection of the antibiotic solution (prepared in step 1.1), at 10 mg/kg of body weight.\nPlace the rat in the dorsal decubitus position on a heated pad and use a dissection microscope at 10x or 20x magnification to perform the surgical procedure.\nClean the penis and surrounding abdominal skin with povidone-iodine (100 mg/mL).",
    "Manually retract the foreskin and place a superficial stay suture (7.0 suture; see Table of Materials) in the dorsal aspect of the penile glans to apply traction to the penis, leaving the needle holder in place to keep the penis retracted.\nPlace a 22 G venous catheter into the urethra for catheterization using a lubricant gel.\nUsing a surgical scalpel blade (number 11), perform a 1 cm longitudinal ventral incision in the penile skin.\nUsing the pointed forceps and the spring scissors, dissect the penile tissue layers until exposing the urethra at the mid-shaft level.\nWith an electrocautery device (see Table of Materials), apply a current with 10 W, for 1 s, in the lateral aspects of the urethra (in one location on each side), ventrally at the level of the midshaft of the penis.\nClose the incision with a 6.0 absorbable running suture (see Table of Materials).\nRemove the urethral catheter. Remove the penile traction suture.\nPerform the subcutaneous injection of analgesia: Carprofen at 5 mg/kg of body weight, and buprenorphine at 0.03 mg/kg of body weight.\nLoad the syringe with the anti-sedative solution (prepared in step 1.2) and, with the animal in ventral decubitus, tent the loose skin to administer a subcutaneous injection of the anti-sedative solution.\n3. Surgical procedure of urethroplasty with a buccal mucosa graft\nNOTE: The surgical procedures were performed using a stereo microscope (10x) (see Table of Materials).\nSterilize all surgical tools needed for this intervention: pointed forceps, spring scissors, ophthalmic needle holder, surgical scissors, needle holder, three mosquito forceps, and a scalpel blade (number 11). Use small sponges to clean the surgical field.\nAdminister the anesthetic, the antibiotic, the restrain and place the animal as described previously (steps 2.2-2.8).",
    "Clean the buccal mucosa of the lower lip, the penis, and the surrounding abdominal skin with povidone-iodine (100 mg/mL).\nPlace three stay sutures (7.0 sutures) in the lower lip, at both sides and in the middle, and leave a mosquito in each one to retract the lower lip and expose the inner mucosa.\nUsing spring scissors and pointed forceps, harvest a 4 mm diameter graft of the lower lip inner buccal mucosa, and place it in a small recipient with sterile saline (0.9% NaCl).\nApply compression in the donor area with a sponge for hemostasis.\nRemove the previously placed stay sutures of the lower lip.\nExpose the penis as described previously (step 2.9).\nPlace a 22 G venous catheter into the urethra for catheterization using a lubricant gel.\nUsing spring scissors, perform a circumferential, sub-coronal incision and deglove the penis to the base.\nUsing the pointed forceps and the spring scissors, dissect the remaining layers and expose the urethra.\nUsing a surgical scalpel blade (number 11) and spring scissors, perform a longitudinal ventral incision, starting 3 mm distal to the coronal sulcus in an extension of 4 mm, spatulating the urethra at the level of the previously inducted stricture (step 2).\nPlace two stay sutures of 7.0 material, one at each side of the spatulation, and leave a mosquito in each one to retract the urethra.\nPlace two 7.0 non-absorbable sutures, one at each end of the spatulation.\nPlace the buccal mucosa graft in a ventral onlay fashion with the mucosa side facing the urethral lumen.\nPass one of the sutures through the graft end and perform a half ellipse with a running suture.\nRepeat step 3.15 and step 3.16 with the other suture on the other side of the graft.\nRemove the urethral catheter. Reposition the penile skin.",
    "Close the circumferential, sub-coronal incision with a 6.0 absorbable interrupted suture.\nRemove the penile traction suture.\nAdminister the analgesia followed by the anti-sedative solution, as described in steps 2.16-2.17.\n4. Postoperative monitoring\nObserve the rats three to four times every hour, confirming their recovery from anesthesia. Monitor respiration and assess pedal and eye reflexes.\nSubcutaneously inject analgesia every 12 h for 48 h.\n\tNOTE: Carprofen was administered at 1 mL/500 mg of body weight, and buprenorphine was administered at 0.5 mL/500 mg of body weight (see Table of Materials).\nProvide soft food for 48 h after each procedure and water ad libitum.\nMonitor the rats daily following surgery and register their health status and surgery site appearance. Evaluated signs include facial expression, vocalization, activity state, any sign of pain, food, and drink ingestion, voiding, and bleeding.\n5. Blood perfusion evaluation\nNOTE: Blood flow is measured immediately before stricture induction, immediately before urethroplasty, and immediately after urethroplasty.\nPerform laser Doppler perfusion imaging.\n\t\nAnesthetize the rats using the anesthetic solution (step 1.1).\nPut the rat supine on a 37 °C heating pad with penile traction, as described in step 2.9.\nStart the laser Doppler perfusion imager (see Table of Materials) to obtain data. Pre-set the area of interest to be read by the laser beam.\nApply the anti-sedative solution (step 1.2) to revert the anesthesia.\nUsing the image analysis software, draw the region of interest (ROI) around the area of the penis and register the flux values over time.\n6. Radiographic evaluation\nNOTE: Stricture induction confirmation and stricture resolution after urethroplasty are confirmed with a retrograde urethrogram. This evaluation is performed 1 week after stricture induction (before urethroplasty) and 2 weeks after urethroplasty.\nPerform a retrograde urethrogram using a monoplan angiography system (see Table of Materials).",
    "Anesthetize the rats using the anesthetic solution.\nPlace the animal on the angiography mattress in a right oblique decubitus, with penile traction, as described in step 2.9.\nFocus the cone beam on the animal's pelvic area, including the penis.\nPlace a 22 G venous catheter advanced 2 mm into the distal urethra.\nStart instillating 1 mL of iodine radiographic contrast material (1:1 ratio of 623 mg/mL iopromide solution and 0.9% NaCl) into the urethra.\nSimultaneously, perform plain radiography to identify the radiographic contrast fulfilling the urethral lumen and assess the urethral diameter.\nOn completion of imaging, revert the anesthesia with the anti-sedative solution.\n7. Euthanasia\nNOTE: Euthanasia is performed 3 weeks after urethroplasty (4 weeks after stricture induction), immediately after the last perfusion evaluation.\nFill a 2.5 mL syringe with 2 mL/kg pentobarbital sodium (400 mg/mL).\nPerform an intraperitoneal injection of the solution to euthanize the animal.\nSubscription Required.
