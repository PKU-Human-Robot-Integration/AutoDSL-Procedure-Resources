The protocol provides two options to proceed with the tissue samples for optional RNA in-situ hybridization (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1634-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic overview of the two processing options provided in the protocol\nAfter the general preprocessing (steps 1 and 2), the tissues can either be prepared for combined staining of mRNA and proteins (steps 3–5) or for proteins only (steps 6 and 7).\nDeparaffinization and rehydration of tissue sections:\nCut 4–5 μm tissue sections of your tissues of interest and place them on 24 mm coated coverslips (included in the Zellkraftwerk Chip Kit).\nLet the sections dry for at least 12 h at 21°C–24°C (RT) after cutting.\nTransfer the coverslip into a coverslip staining rack for the subsequent procedures.\nIncubate dry sections 12–16 h (overnight) at 60°C in a dried oven and increase the temperature to 70°C for 30 min the next day in order to completely melt the paraffin.\nIncubate 3 × 10 min in Xylene (Roticlear®) at 21°C–24°C (RT).\nIncubate 2 × 10 min in absolute Ethanol (EtOH) at 21°C–24°C (RT).\nIncubate 5 min in 90% EtOH at 21°C–24°C (RT).\nIncubate 5 min in 70% EtOH at 21°C–24°C (RT).\nIncubate 5 min in 50% EtOH at 21°C–24°C (RT).",
    "Note: Keep the coverslips in the 50% EtOH until the antigen retrieval solution is heated up to 90°C (set the temperature for the water bath slightly higher in order to achieve this temperature within the retrieval solution). Depending on the heating speed of the water bath, it might be appropriate to switch on the water bath when the coverslips are transferred from the oven to Xylene.\nNote: A station for deparaffinization and rehydration allows smooth processing of the samples. Especially the transfer from the oven to the first basin of Xylene needs to be as short as possible to avoid paraffin leftovers.\nAntigen retrieval:\nRinse the coverslips in tap water.\nCarefully transfer the coverslips from tap water into the pre-heated retrieval solution.\nIncubate for 20 min at 90°C.\nRemove the coverslips from the antigen retrieval solution and slowly transfer them to a jar filled with PBS at 21°C–24°C (RT).\nNote: From here on it is essential to prevent the tissue from drying out, since this would affect tissue integrity and stainability.\nProceed to step 6 if FISH is not performed.\nNote: In general, RNA in-situ hybridization (Wang et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) is performed as described in the RNAScope protocol. Protease treatment was shown to destroy epitopes for subsequent antibody staining and has been skipped in order to ensure high antibody staining quality for ChipCytometry.\nProbe hybridization for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH):\nRemove the coverslips from the rack and place them horizontally on a piece of paper.\nCreate a hydrophobic barrier around the tissue using a hydrophobic barrier pen.",
    "Note: For all incubation steps performed on the coverslips, make sure that the whole tissue is covered with reagent. Usually 150–200 μl are an adequate volume depending on the tissue size. Washing steps are performed by rinsing the coverslips in 1 mL steps.\nIncubate in H2O2 (included in the RNAScope Kit) for 10 min at 21°C–24°C (RT).\nWash (carefully rinse the coverslip) with 10 mL H2O.\nIncubate with Sudan Black B for 10 min at 21°C–24°C (RT).\nCarefully rinse coverslip with 1 mL 70% EtOH [10 times].\nCritical: Washing of Sudan Black B is important to preserve high signal intensities. Excessive Sudan Black B leftover on the tissue may lead to reduced staining intensities.\nWash with 10 mL PBS.\nHybridize probes for 2 h at 40°C according to instructions of the RNAScope multiplex fluorescence kit.\nWash with RNAScope wash buffer.\nNote: To prevent the tissues from drying out during the incubation, place a wet tissue paper in the incubator underneath the sample slides and cover it with a lid to create a humidified chamber.\nChip loading for FISH:\nWipe off any liquid from the coverslip that is not covering the tissue itself.\nRemove the adhesive film from the ZellSafeTM tissue chip.\nTransfer the coverslip to the chip and make sure that the whole tissue is located within the visible window of the chip.\nGently press together the chip and the coverslip to assure that the system is leakproof.\nRinse the chip with 5 mL 5× Sodium saline citrate (SSC) buffer and remove any air bubbles.\nNote: Air bubbles should be strictly avoided and removed immediately in case of appearance.\nFISH signal amplification, acquisition and quenching:",
    "Scan background of the tissue with the ChipCytometry microscope while it is in 5× SSC buffer (chip can be stored in 5× SSC up to 16 h at 4°C).\nRinse the chip with 10 mL wash buffer.\nFollow the instructions of the RNAScope in situ hybridization kit for signal development.\nNote: Opal dyes compatible with the fluorescent channels of the Zellscanner instrument are listed in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\nRinse the chip with 5 mL PBS.\nAcquire signals in the corresponding channels with the ChipCytometry microscope.\nRinse the chip with 5 mL quenching buffer.\nIncubate 30 min under white light at 21°C–24°C (RT), exchange buffer every 5 min to avoid formation of air bubbles in the chip.\nRinse with 20 mL PBST.\nProceed with cyclic immunofluorescence via ChipCytometry (step 8). Steps 6 and 7 represent the preprocessing for the option without FISH staining.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1634_6.csv\nBV = Brilliant Violet, BUV = Brilliant Ultraviolet, eF = eFluor, PB = Pacific Blue, DAPI = 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole, FITC = Fluorescein isothiocyanate, AF = Alexa Fluor, GFP = Green Fluorescent Protein, PE = Phycoerythrin, PerCP = Peridinin-Chlorophyll-Protein.\nChip loading for antibody staining only:\nWipe off any liquid from the coverslip that is not covering the tissue itself.\nTransfer the coverslip on the ChipCytometry chip according to manufactureŕs instructions making sure that the whole tissue is located within the visible window of the chip.\nRinse the chip with 5 mL PBS and remove any air bubbles.\nNote: Air bubbles should be strictly avoided and removed immediately in case of appearance.\nPre-treatments enhancing specificity and quality of antibody staining.\nBlocking:\nAdd 500 μL of 5% goat serum in PBST into the chip.\nIncubate for 1–2 h at 21°C–24°C (RT).\nRinse with 1 mL PBS [5 times].\nAutofluorescence quenching:",
    "Add 500 μL 0.1% Sudan Black B solution into the chip, incubate 10 min at 21°C–24°C (RT).\nRinse with 1 mL of 70% ethanol, incubate 1 min at 21°C–24°C (RT).\nWash (gently push) with 1 mL of 70% ethanol, wait 1 min [2 times].\nWash (push faster) with 1 mL of 70% ethanol, wait 1 min [2 times].\nNote: The washing of Sudan Black B within the chip is more difficult than on the coverslip (compare steps 3e and f). Repeat the washing procedure if there are visible components of the Sudan Black B solution still inside the chip.\nRinse with 1 mL PBST [3 times]. Force liquid flow by pushing PBST through the channel.\nRinse with 1 mL PBST, wait 1 min [3 times].\nCritical: Washing of Sudan Black B is important to keep signal intensities high. If too much Sudan Black B is still on the tissue, this may lead to reduced staining intensities.\nCyclic immunofluorescence via ChipCytometry\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nThis step describes the general procedure of ChipCytometry as cyclic immunofluorescence method. The specifications for individual channels can be found in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\nOptional: Photobleaching before the first background acquisition can further reduce autofluorescence of the sample and might be considered if the tissue is prone to high autofluorescence.\nAcquire a background image in all required channels using the ChipCytometry microscope.\nRinse the chip with 5 mL PBST in order to establish a liquid flow through the chip.\nStaining:\nPrepare 300 μL antibody master mix per chip containing all antibodies in titrated concentration, mix by pipetting [10 times].\nCentrifuge master mix for 10 min 16.000 × g (or max speed) at 4°C to remove dye or antibody aggregates.\nTransfer 290 μL of the mix into the chip without touching the bottom of the tube.",
    "Incubate 8–14 h at 4°C (shorter incubation times are possible depending on the epitope).\nRinse the chip with 20 mL PBST.\nAcquire the signal in the dedicated channels using the ChipCytometry microscope.\nPhoto bleach each position for 20 s using the ChipCytometry microscope.\nNote: All photobleaching steps are performed with the built-in HBO lamb (Zeiss HBO 100 Microscope Illuminator with a 364 nm long pass filter to protect epitope damage from UV light).\nWash the chip with 5 mL PBST.\nNote: Repeat steps 8–14 until all markers (see Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] for a list of validated markers) have been stained on a chip.\nPause point: After bleaching and washing, the chip can be kept at 4°C for several months. However, for some markers the staining intensity may decrease over time. If the chip is kept for more than seven days, rinse with 2 mL Zellkraftwerk Storage buffer (included in the ZellSafe Chip Kit).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1634_7.csv\neF = eFluor, FITC = Fluorescein isothiocyanate, AF = Alexa Fluor, PE = Phycoerythrin, PerCP = Peridinin-Chlorophyll-Protein, o.n. = overnight (8–14 h)."
