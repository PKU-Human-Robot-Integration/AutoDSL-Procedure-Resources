    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Review Board of Washington University in St. Louis (Human Resource Protection Office Number: 201208010).\n1. Obtaining the vrRSB\nTo obtain a copy of the vrRSB, send an email request to the senior author, John Constantino (constantino@wustl.edu).\nSpecify a preference for the online version of the vrRSB or the hard-copy format.\n\t\nPlease note that the online version (\"Online_vrRSB\") is formatted for implementation in REDCap, a widely used, secure, online data collection tool (www.projectredcap.org) available to individuals at institutions which are members of the REDCap Consortium.\nPlease note that the hard-copy version includes PDF's of the questionnaire, a copy of the password-protected online link to the video clip, and scoring instructions. Interested parties may also request paper copies of these files, as well as a DVD with the video.\n2. Uploading and Enabling the Online vrRSB in REDCap\nSave the online file for the vrRSB (Online_vrRSB) in a known computer location.\nBefore uploading the Online_vrRSB into REDCap, create a new project to house the questionnaire in REDCap. First, log in to REDCap and click New Project in the ribbon at the top of the page. This step will launch a Create a New REDCap Project page.\nEnter study-specific text into the fields Project title and Purpose of the project. These fields are required to proceed.\nFor the prompt Start project from scratch or begin with a template? select the radio button Upload a REDCap project xml file. A window providing access to computer files should then appear; choose the Online_vrRSB file from step 2.1 and click Open.\nScroll to the bottom of the page and click Create Project. This step will open a Project setup page, which provides a workflow for incorporating surveys into a REDCap project.",
    "In the box labeled Main Project Settings, click Enable next to the option Use surveys in this project. This step allows the vrRSB to be accessible within the project.\nProceed to the next box, labelled Design your data collection instruments & enable your surveys. Select Online designer. This will open a screen with a table of instruments within the project.\nIn the row which contains the vrRSB, click on Enable a survey. A Set up my survey tab should then appear.\nScroll to the bottom of the page and click Save changes to complete the enabling of the vrRSB in a REDCap project.\n3. Customizing the Presentation of the Online vrRSB in REDCap\nClick Project Home in the sidebar menu and locate the Quick Tasks box.\nIn the Quick Tasks box, select Online designer and upload data dictionary to open a Data collection instruments table listing the vrRSB as part of the REDCap project.\nTo modify instructions within the vrRSB text, click the vrRSB listing. Click on the pencil in the upper left of specific text boxes to edit existing text and hit Save after each modification.\n\t\nIn the box labeled Welcome page, provide study-specific background information as appropriate (for suggestions, see step 4.2).\nClick Add fields to allow entry of additional participant characteristics if needed. The current template includes age of the rated child in months, sex, and the relationship of the rater to the child.\nEdit the instructions preceding the video-referenced items by inserting a study contact person in the event of technical difficulties with the video.\nTo customize survey format (e.g. background color, font), click Survey settings in the row for the vrRSB within the data collection instruments table.",
    "To obtain an online link for the survey, return to Project Home and click on Manage survey participants in the Quick Tasks box. A Public survey link page will open, which provides a URL for the survey. Click the button next to the URL to copy the survey link.\n\t\nTo email a link to study participants, select the Participant list tab. Click Add participants to insert emails and compose survey invitations button to generate an introductory email.\n4. Administering the vrRSB\nSelect respondents who understand written English and who have spent at least 6 hours observing the target child (18 - 30 months of age) in the past month. Successful completion of the vrRSB does not require or assume specialized training, only that respondents have routinely observed the behavior of a young child in his or her natural interactions with other people. Respondents may include caregivers, clinicians, other professionals who have worked closely with a child, or researchers who wish to use the video scoring anchor to generate calibrated ratings to compare multiple children.\n\tNOTE: A 30-minute observation of a child engaged in a semi-structured interactive play session has been shown to be sufficient for raters to provide scores distinguishing children with and without ASD12. The 6-hour benchmark is intended to account for greater expected variability in real-world social situations.\nWhen presenting the survey to respondents, provide background information for clarification, e.g., the purpose for administering the vrRSB, the use of video-referenced items, and the expected time for completion (10 - 15 minutes).\n\t\nFor cases in which respondents participate remotely, include such information in a cover letter accompanying the vrRSB.\nFor cases in which participants complete the vrRSB online, provide the web address to access the vrRSB.",
    "Explain whether the video of the scoring anchor is to be accessed online or from a DVD. For online access, include the web address and password.\nInform respondents whom to contact for help should they have difficulty accessing the full video, seeing the images, or hearing sound. In the online version, this notification is included in the instructions preceding the video-referenced items (step 3.3).\nRemind respondents to attend to the entire 3-minute video clip, which they may watch more than once.\n\tNOTE: Respondents next complete questions 1 - 13, the video-referenced items, in which they are to compare the subject child's current social abilities to that of the child in the video - the scoring anchor. Following completion of the video-referenced items, respondents are to complete the remaining non-video-referenced items, which describe characteristic aspects of social behavior. Both video-and non-video-referenced items use a four-point Likert rating scale, and written instructions precede both sets of items in the body of the questionnaire (Appendix 1).\n5. Automated Scoring of the Online vrRSB\nTo view an individual's scores (which may be useful in clinical settings), click Add/edit records under Data Collection in the sidebar menu.\n\t\nIn the following screen, under Choose an Existing Participation Identification #, select the participant from the dropdown menu. The Record Home Page for that participant will appear, which contains a table listing instruments collected for that participant.\nTo access total and subscale scores for that participant, click Status in the row for vrRSB scores.\nTo view vrRSB scores for all participants in a given study, return to the project home page and click Create report.\n\t\nEnter a name for the report in the text box and proceed to step 2, which allows the selection of data fields to include in the report.",
    "Next to the option Add all fields from selected instruments, select vrRSB scores from the dropdown menu to obtain total and subscale scores. For item-level data, select vrRSB. To keep only a subset of available fields in the report, click the red x to the right of unwanted fields so they are excluded.\nScroll to the bottom of the page and click Save report. Accept the option to Return to my reports and exports, which will display a table including a row with the newly created report.\nClick View report to see scores (Table 1) for all participants. To return to the table of viewing options, click the ‘My Reports and Exports’ tab.\nClick Export data and select the format of choice (e.g., csv format). Then click the export data button at the lower right. In the follow-up screen, click on the icon confirming the data format to continue.\nClick the \"Stats and charts\" button to view descriptive statistics (e.g., means for total scores, standard deviations) and scatterplots of vrRSB scores in REDCap.\n6. Manual Scoring of the vrRSB\nIdentify items as forward-scored or reverse-scored (Table 1, Classification of Forward- and Reverse-Scored Items).\n\tNOTE: Because the scale is designed to quantify deficits in RSB, an indicator of the level of core autistic symptoms, higher point values indicate lower levels of RSB. Forward-scored items are those for which a more affirmative answer indicates less appropriate reciprocal social behavior. Reverse-scored items are those for which a more affirmative answer indicates more appropriate reciprocal social behavior.\nAssign each response a value, as indicated in Table 1 (Point Values for Item Ratings).\nAssign a value of zero for missing item responses. Surveys with more than four missing responses are considered invalid.",
    "Once items have been assigned the proper point values, add the appropriate items together for the main score(s) or subscale score(s) of choice (Table 1).\n\tNOTE: Main scoring options include the RSB Total Score (video-referenced plus non-video-referenced RSB items) and the Video-referenced Score; subscale item totals are also noted for the 2 core symptom domains for ASD (i.e., social communication and restricted, repetitive behavior). Scores ≥2 standard deviations below the mean, in the bottom 5% of the scores obtained in a general population sample12, are suggestive of deficiencies in RSB (Table 1).\nNote that some items are not included in scoring for the vrRSB. These supplemental items provide general information on aspects of development other than RSB, which may be of interest to developmental researchers. See the caption of Table 1 for further details."
