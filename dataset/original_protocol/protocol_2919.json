The shRNA pools are purchased from Cellecta. A scheme of the synthetic lethal screen is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2665-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic of the pooled lentiviral shRNA library screen (Created with BioRender.com[href=https://biorender.com/])\nGenerated pooled lentiviral library was transduced into both Huh7-parental and Sorafenib-resistant cells. With 3 μg/mL puromycin treatment for at least 4 days to confirm the library to be transduced into the cells successfully. Either DMSO or Sorafenib was added into DMEM, culture Huh7-parental for another 2 weeks, culture Huh7-IR and Huh7-CR cells for another 4 weeks; Following with the genomic DNA extraction, shRNA barcodes amplification and the NGS sequencing with Data analysis.\nCritical: The library contains 50467 pooled lentiviral shRNAs targeting 6317 genes. To generate a sufficient virus titer, a batch of 100 μg plasmid is recommended for the production.\nSeed 1 × 107 HEK-293T cells into seven T175 flasks each, culture cells with high glucose DMEM contains 10% FBS and 2 mM L-Glutamine at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nNote: Don’t add antibiotics (Penicillin/streptomycin) to DMEM when producing lentivirus.\nTransfection of pooled lentiviral shRNA library.\nOnce the cell confluence reaches approximately 50%, replace medium with 30 mL fresh medium.\nPrepare two sterile 50 mL Falcon tubes and prepare the transfection system as follows: Tube A: 12 mL Opti-MEM, 37.5 μg pMD2.G, 75 μg pMDLg/pRRE, 25 μg pRSV-Rev, 100 μg library plasmid, mix well with pipette; Tube B: 12 mL Opti-MEM, 720 μL FuGENE, mix well with pipette.\nTransfer tube B into tube A, mix well with pipette or vortex, then incubate for 15 min at around 23°C.",
    "Transfer 3 mL mixture to each T175 flask and crossly rock the flasks to mix well with medium, then, put the cells to the incubator.\n18 h post transfection, change medium with 30 mL fresh high glucose DMEM.\nHarvest the shRNA library virus.\n48 h post-transfection, collect all the culture medium in 50 mL falcon tubes.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 500 g for 5 min, pass the supernatant through a 0.45 μm syringe filter.\nFreeze the viral supernatant in aliquots of 5 mL in 15 mL Falcon tubes at −80°C for further use.\nLentiviral virus titration\nTiming: ∼ 1 week\nTo determinate the virus titer, thaw one aliquot of the frozen viral supernatant and dilute it at different dilution factors and measure the transfection efficiency.\nSeed cells and infect cells with diluted virus supernatant:\nSeed 1 × 105 Huh7 cells per well in two 12-well plates.\nOnce the cell confluence reaches 50%, thaw one frozen viral supernatant on ice.\nDilute the virus supernatant with complete high glucose DMEM at a ratio of 1:100, 1:400, 1:1000, 1:4000, 1:10000, 1:40000 to a final volume of 10 mL virus solution (100 μL, 25 μL, 10 μL, 2.5 μL, 1 μL, 0.25 μL of virus respectively).\nTake 3 mL diluted virus solution and add polybrene to 5 μg/mL.\nTransfer 1 mL diluted solution to each well (each ratio with duplicate wells).\nKeep four wells without virus infection as control.\nNote: Polybrene is used to enhance the infection efficiency.\n12 h later, change medium with 1 mL fresh complete high glucose DMEM.\n24 h post the infection, change with 1 mL fresh complete high glucose DMEM contains 3 μg/mL puromycin (for the four control wells, two with puromycin, two without puromycin to confirm the efficacy of puromycin).",
    "Culture cells for another 72 h, stain the cells with 0.5% Crystal Violet and calculate the transduction efficiency of different dilution factors.\nRepeat the virus transduction two more times, plot the crystal violet staining ratio versus dilution factors into a chart, as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2665-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Estimation of the virus titer\nA plot of the infected cells (%) versus dilution factors: when the virus is diluted with 1:1000, around 50% cells are infected, the estimated MOI is around 0.7. With the estimated MOI, the virus titer is with the formula: Virus titer = Cell numbers × MO / Dilution factor.\nCalculate the viral concentration as the formula: Titer equals cell numbers × estimated MOI/dilution factor, then calculate the virus volume required for the transduction to obtain a transduction efficiency of around 40%, which is considered a MOI of 0.5 for the next steps.\nTransduction of library\nTiming: ∼ 4 weeks\nThe pooled lentiviral shRNA library will be transduced into Huh7-parental, Huh7-IR and Huh7-CR cell lines, a MOI of 0.5 will be used. After the transduction, cells will be treated with 3 μg/mL puromycin for at least 4 days, afterward, DMSO or Sorafenib will be added to the cells until harvest.\nSet up four experimental groups as Huh7-parental + DMSO, Huh7-parental + 5 μM Sorafenib, Huh7-IR + 7 μM Sorafenib, Huh7-CR + 7 μM Sorafenib: take eight T175 flasks for each group, seed 1 × 107 cells per flask.\nInfect cells and puromycin selection:\nTake seven T175 flasks of cells per group when the cell confluence reaches 50%.\nThaw the frozen viral aliquots, dilute virus with complete high glucose DMEM at a MOI of 0.5.\nAdd polybrene to a final concentration of 5 μg/mL to the diluted virus and then infect the cells.",
    "24 h later, change medium with fresh complete high glucose DMEM containing 3 μg/mL puromycin.\nTake the residual one T175 flask from each group (four flasks in total) as the control.\nTreat the control cells with 3 μg/mL puromycin for at least 4 days to confirm the successful transduction of the pooled lentiviral shRNA library.\nDMSO or Sorafenib treatment and cell harvest:\nTreat the cells with either DMSO or Sorafenib as mentioned in step 9, culture Huh7-parental + DMSO / 5 μM Sorafenib for around 2 weeks.\nCulture Huh7-IR/CR cells for over 10 passages to generate sufficient cell numbers.\nTrypsinize the cells and combine all the cells from the same treatment group (6 × 107 cells are needed, which is 1000 times of the library size).\nCentrifuge at 300 g for 5 min, remove the supernatant and collect the cell pellets for the next step.\nNote: Upon treatment with Sorafenib, Huh7-parental cells will only survive for approximately 2 weeks. Hence, these cells will be harvested for analysis after 2 weeks, as the shRNAs which had dropped out in Huh7-parental cells upon acute treatment with 5 μM Sorafenib will be subtracted from the synthetic lethal gene list, to specifically enrich for the genes critical for the maintenance of Sorafenib resistance.\nExtraction of genomic DNA for samples\nTiming: ∼ 1 week\nTo isolate whole genomic DNA from the cells of genetic screen, a conventional genomic DNA extraction protocol is used.\nResuspend cell pellets in 5 mL QIAGEN Buffer P1 (Cat# 19051) with 5 μL RNase A (final concentration is 100 μg/mL, Cat# 19101) with 15 mL Falcon tubes, add 250 μL 10% SDS, mix well and incubate at around 23°C for 5 min.\nSonicate to shear DNA into 10–100 kb sized fragments with an ultrasonic homogenizer at 4°C.",
    "Add 10 μL Proteinase K (final concentration is 40 μg/mL), mix well and incubate at around 23°C for 15 min.\nAdd 5 mL Phenol: Chloroform: Isoamyl Alcohol solution (25:24:1), vortex and centrifuge with 6000 g for 60 min at 23°C.\nTake 4 mL of upper phase, and transfer to new 15 mL Falcon tubes, add 500 μL 3 M Sodium Acetate and 4 mL Isopropanol, mix well and centrifuge with 6000 g for 30 min at 23°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and wash with 10 mL 70% Ethanol, centrifuge with 6000 g for 5 min at 23°C, discard the supernatant and dry the pellet.\nDissolve the pellet into ddH2O, check the extraction quality by electrophoresis in 3.5% agarose gels and measure the concentrations of genomic DNA.\nAmplification of Barcode Sequences from genomic DNA\nTiming: ∼ 1 week\nThe shRNA barcodes are amplified using NGS Prep Kit (CELLECTA, Cat# LNGS-120), the protocol is based on two rounds of PCR to amplify the shRNA barcode sequences. PCR products are purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit and separated by electrophoresis in 3.5% agarose gels, bands were excised and purified using QIAquick gel extraction kit.\nFirst Round PCR.\nThe goal of the first round PCR is to amplify barcodes out of total genomic DNA. When amplifying the barcodes from samples which are generated by the positive selection screen, adequate amounts of genomic DNA are needed (up to 400 μg).\nPrepare the master mix according to the following table. A maximum of 50 μg genomic DNA is used in 100 μL volume per reaction. With 400 μg genomic DNA as template, eight reactions are set up at 100 μL each;\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2665_3.csv\nMix well, centrifuge briefly, and start the PCR program with the following cycling conditions;\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2665_4.csv",
    "Critical: The numbers of cycles depend on how many genomic DNA is used. If less than 50 μg are added in a 100 μL PCR reaction, one or two more cycles are recommended.\nCombine all the individual reactions into one tube for each group sample, the PCR products will be used for the second round PCR.\nPause point: The PCR product can be stored at −20°C for 6 months, if not perform the second round PCR immediately.\nSecond Round PCR.\nPrimers for the second round PCR contain the P5 and P7 sequences which are complementary to the immobilized primers in the NGS illumine flow cells. The NGS Prep Kits provide the index primer sets which contain different index sequences and can be used to deconvolute the sequencing results for each sample mixed together in the same flow cell or sequencing lane. Details are found in the User Manual of the NGS Prep kit.\nUse 5 μL of PCR product from the first round PCR as the template, prepare the mix according to the following table (2 reactions with 100 μL per reaction);\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2665_5.csv\nCritical: Each sample to be sequenced together in a single lane needs to use different NRev Index primers from the NGS Prep kit.\nMix well, centrifuge briefly, and start the PCR program with the following cycling conditions;\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2665_6.csv\nPCR purification and extraction.\nPCR products from the second round PCR are analyzed by gel electrophoresis to ensure equal amounts of amplified barcodes for all samples. Purify the PCR products by the following steps.\nUse the QIAquick PCR purification kit to purify the PCR products following the manufacturer’s protocol[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=95f10677-aa29-453d-a222-0e19f01ebe17&lang=en]. For the last centrifugation step, take the maximum speed for 5 min to completely dry the membrane;",
    "Load the purified PCR products on a 3.5% agarose gel to separate the bands by electrophoresis;\nExcise the bands and extract DNA with QIAquick gel extraction kit;\nQuantitate the DNA concentration at A260nm using NanoDrop, and store for next generation sequencing with an Illumina HiSeq (Illumina).\nPause point: The PCR product can be stored at −20°C for 6 months, if not perform the NGS sequencing immediately.\nNGS (next generation sequencing) deep sequencing and data analysis\nTiming: ∼ 4 weeks\nNGS deep sequencing.\nPooled amplified barcodes will be sequenced by NGS on an Illumina Hiseq (80–100 million reads per sample) using the GexSeq sequencing primer. Take 2 μL of 10 nM PCR product from the purified DNA band for the cluster generation step. The number of cycles for hGW library is 44, for the other libraries, the cycle numbers required depend on the length of barcode.\nAdjust the purified PCR samples to a final concentration of 10 nM.\nTo each lane, add 2 μL sample and Phix174 control template based on the standard Illumina protocol for cluster generation using the Illumina single-read flow cell.\nAdd GexSeq primer to the PhiX174 primer to get a final concentration of 0.5 μM for the NGS step.\nRun the NGS reaction for 44 cycles with a Hiseq TruSeq SR Cluster Kit v3-cbot-HS.\nData analysis.\nThe open-source processing pipeline in edgeR5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] provides a complete analysis solution for the synthetic lethal screen data. It begins with the raw sequence reads and ends with a ranked list of candidate genes for downstream biological validation.\nFirst summarize the raw data contained in a fastq file into a matrix of counts (samples in the columns, genes in the rows) with options for allowing mismatches and small shifts in sequence position;",
