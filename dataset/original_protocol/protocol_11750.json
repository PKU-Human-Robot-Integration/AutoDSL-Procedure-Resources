    "This study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of UCSD's Human Research Protections Program (181180).\n1. Definitive endoderm induction from induced pluripotent stem cells (Day 1 - 3)\nSlowly thaw growth factor reduced (GFR)-basement membrane (BM) matrix medium on ice 30 minutes prior to use. In cold DMEM/F12, mixture, dilute the GFR BM matrix medium 1:1 such that it constitutes 50% of this medium. Place P1000 pipette tips in the freezer to chill prior to use.\nCoat each well of a 12-well plate with 500 µL of 50% GFR-basement membrane matrix medium prepared in ice-cold DMEM/F12. Once the desired number of wells are coated, remove any excess medium mixture and/or bubbles from wells and place the plate on ice or refrigerator at 4 °C for 20 min to set. Then, move the plate to the incubator at 37 °C overnight to gel and dry.\nOnce hiPSCs reach 70-90% confluency, add 10 µM of Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) Inhibitor Y-27632 an hour prior to dissociation. Aspirate off the media and wash once with Phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Dissociate hiPSCs by adding cell detachment medium (0.5 mL/ well of a 12-well plate) and incubate for 20 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nRemove plates from the incubator and add 0.5 mL/12-well of stem cell passaging medium (Table 1) to the wells; gently triturate cells using a P1000 tip to obtain single-cell suspension. Transfer dissociated cells into a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube; centrifuge for 5 min at 300 x g.",
    "Aspirate off the medium and resuspend the cell pellet with 1 mL of mTeSR Plus media supplemented with 10 µM ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632). Perform a cell count. Add 2.0 x 105 hiPSCs in 1 mL of mTeSR supplemented with ROCK Inhibitor Y-27632 per well of a 12-well GFR-basement membrane medium coated plate. Incubate at 37 °C overnight.\n\tNOTE: Cell seeding number must be optimized per cell line. 24 h after plating, wells should be 50%-70% confluent.\nOn day 1, aspirate off the mTeSR Plus and add Definitive Endoderm (DE) induction media (Table 1) supplemented with 100 ng/mL of human activin A and 5 µM of GSK3β inhibitor/Wnt activator CHIR99021.\n\t​NOTE: DE media with GSK3β inhibitor/Wnt activator CHIR99021 should be removed within 20-24 h of day 1 DE induction for successful differentiation.\nOn day 2 and day 3, change to DE induction media supplemented with 100 ng/mL of activin A only.\n\t​NOTE: DE differentiation should not exceed a total of 72 h, or efficacy will decrease. On day 4, if large cell die-off is observed, decrease total DE media exposure time by 6-12 h.\nTo analyze DE efficiency, confirm greater than 90% CXCR4 and/or cKit expression via flow cytometry or immunofluorescence analysis of FOXA2 and/or SOX17 (Figure 2a).\n2. Anterior foregut endoderm (AFE) induction (Day 4 - 6)\nOn day 4, change media to serum free basal medium (SFBM) (Table 1) supplemented with 10 µM SB431542 and 2 µM Dorsomorphin for AFE induction. Change AFE media daily for 3 days (day 4, day 5, and day 6).\nTo analyze AFE efficiency, confirm robust expression of SOX2, TBX1, and FOXA2 via immunofluorescence staining (Figure 2b).\n3. Lung progenitor cell (LPC) differentiation (Day 7 - 16)",
    "On day 7, thaw GFR-basement membrane matrix medium on ice. Aspirate off the AFE media and wash well with 1x PBS. Add 1 mL of cell detachment solution and incubate for 10 min at 37 °C.\nAdd 1 mL of quenching medium (2% FBS in DMEM/F12) to the wells containing cell detachment solution. Keep cells as aggregates by pipetting up and down gently. Make sure all cells are dislodged and transferred into a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube. Centrifuge for 5 min at 300 x g.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in Quenching medium supplemented with 10 ng/mL of human recombinant bone morphogenic protein-4 (BMP4), 0.1 µM of all-trans retinoic acid (RA), 3 µM of GSK3β inhibitor/Wnt activator CHIR99021, and 10 µM of Rock Inhibitor Y-27632.\nPerform a cell count. Add 2.5 x 105 cells to 100 µL of cold GFR-basement membrane matrix medium, mix well, and place droplet into a well of a 12-well plate. Incubate the plate at 37 °C for 30-60 min to allow the medium to polymerize. Add 1 mL of LPC media supplemented with 10 µM of ROCK Inhibitor Y-27632 per well ensuring the medium drop is fully submerged and incubate at 37 °C overnight.\nOn day 8, 24 h after LPC induction, change LPC medium to remove ROCK Inhibitor Y-27632. Change the LPC medium every other day for a total of 9-11 days.\n\tNOTE: If the medium becomes yellow within 24 h, change medium every day.\nTo analyze LPC efficiency, confirm robust expression of the intracellular transcription factor NKX2-1 or perform flow cytometry for surface markers CD47hi/CD26low15 or CPM18 (Figure 2c). Grossly, the LPC spheroids should be round and transparent (Figure 2c).\n\t​NOTE: Do not proceed with lung organoid differentiation if efficiency of NKX2-1 is below 30%.",
    "4. 3D lung organoid induction (Day 16 - 22)\nOn day 17, thaw GFR-basement membrane matrix medium on ice. Aspirate the LPC induction medium. Then add 2 µg/mL of dispase (1 mL) to the well and resuspend the medium/dispase mixture with a P1000 pipette. Incubate at 37 °C for 15 min. Triturate the mixture again and incubate at 37 °C for another 15 min.\nTransfer the dispase and cells into a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube. Use chilled PBS (2-3 mL) to wash the well and resuspend the dispase/cell mixture. Centrifuge for 5 min at 400 x g. Manually remove the supernatant, being careful not to distub the medium/cell pellet layer. Repeat the chilled PBS wash, and centrifuge the conical centrifuge tube for another 5 min at 400 x g.\nManually remove the supernatant, and then add 2 mL of trypsin- based dissociation solution to the conical centrifuge tube. Incubate at 37 °C for 12 min.\nAfter incubation, resuspend cells with a P1000 pipette tip. Then add an equal volume of quenching media to the conical centrifuge tube and spin down at 400 x g for 5 min. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend cells  in quenching medium + 10 µM of ROCK Inhibitor Y-27632.\n\tNOTE: Successful lung organoid induction occurs when cells are embedded as aggregates, not single cells, adjust pipetting accordingly.\nPerform a cell count. Calculate the volume needed to obtain 5.0-8.0 x 104 cells per well. Aliquot the LPC cell aggregates into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuge for 5 min at 400 x g. Remove excess supernatant, being careful to not agitate the cell pellet. Leave only 10 µL of residual media.",
    "Re-suspend the cell pellet in 200 µL of cold GFR-basement membrane matrix medium and add to cell culture membrane inserts (6.5 mm diameter, 0.4 µm pore, polyester membrane). Incubate the plate at 37 °C for 30-60 min to allow GFR-basement membrane matrix medium to polymerize.\nAdd 1 mL of 3D organoid induction medium (Table 1) supplemented with fibroblast growth factor-7 (FGF7) (10 ng/mL), FGF10 (10 ng/mL), GSK3β inhibitor/Wnt activator CHIR (3 µM), epidermal growth factor (EGF) (10 ng/mL), and 10 µM of ROCK Inhibitor Y-27632 to the basolateral chamber of the membrane insert. Change the medium every other day for 6 days.\n5. 3D Lung organoid branching (Day 23 - 28)\nOn day 23 change to 3D branching medium (Table 1) supplemented with FGF7 (10 ng/mL), FGF10 (10 ng/mL), GSK3β inhibitor/Wnt activator CHIR99021 (3 µM), RA (0.1 µM), EGF (10 ng/mL), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) / placental growth factor (PlGF) (10 ng/mL). Change the medium every other day for 6 days.\n\tNOTE: At day 6 of 3D branching differentiation, there should be multiple branching organoids (Figure 2).\n6. 3D lung organoid maturation (Day 29 - 34)\nOn day 29, change to 3D maturation medium (Table 1), which is the same as 3D branching medium but with the addition of dexamethasone (50 nM), cAMP (100 µM), and and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor also termed isobutylxanthine (100 µM). Change the medium every other day for 6 days.\n\t​NOTE: Within 24 h after 3D maturation, the branching organoids should expand and change into transparent spheres.\n7. 3D Lung organoid immunocytochemistry\nFor 3D whole lung organoid analysis, fix GFR-basement membrane matrix medium in the membrane inserts with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 1 h at 4 °C. Embed in paraffin wax and mount onto slides per standard published protocols.",
    "Perform antigen retrieval prior to staining. Airway markers include KRT5, MUC5AC, and SCGB3A2. Alveolar markers include SP-C, SP-B, HTII-280, HTI-56, and HOPX (Figure 3).\n8. Removal of whole lung organoids from GFR-basement membrane matrix medium for passage, FACS, or cryopreservation\nTo dissociate the organoids from the GFR-basement membrane matrix medium, remove media from the basal chamber and add 2 µg/mL of dispase (1 mL) in the apical chamber.\nGently triturate the medium /dispase mixture with a P1000 pipette and place in the incubator for 15 min. Gently triturate the mixture again and incubate for another 15 min.\nAdd 1 mL of chilled PBS (4 °C) and transfer organoids with the matrix medium into a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube. Spin at 400 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant carefully, not to disturb the cell pellet.\nWash once more with 1 mL chilled PBS and spin down at 400 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant carefully, not to disturb the medium/cell mixture.\nAdd 1 mL of cell detachment solution to the conical centrifuge tube, gently triturate resuspend the GFR-Basement membrane matrix medium/cell mixture. Place in the incubator for 12 min for passaging cells as aggregates or for cryopreservation), or 20 min for single cell suspension.\nAdd equal volume of quenching media and spin down at 400 x g for 5 min. Resuspend in quenching medium + 10 µM of ROCK Inhibitor Y-27632.\n\tNOTE: At this step, no residual basement membrane medium should be seen in the tube. If residual medium remains, repeat steps 8.5 and 8.6.\nPerform a cell count. Calculate the volume needed for downstream applications.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
