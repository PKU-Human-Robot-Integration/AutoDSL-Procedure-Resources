    "All the methodologies described were approved by the Animal Welfare Committee (ORBEA) of the Faculty of Sciences, University of Lisbon, and Direção Geral de Veterinária (DGAV; ref. 0421/000/000/2022), and are in accordance with the European Directive 2010/63/EU.\n1. Preparation of decellularization buffers and reagents\nNOTE: All solutions used during the decellularization protocol should be sterilized by autoclaving and stored for up to 3 months unless stated otherwise.\nPrepare 10x phosphate-buffered saline (10x PBS) by adding sodium chloride (NaCl) at 137 mM, potassium chloride (KCl) at 2.68 mM, potassium-dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) at 8.1 mM, and disodium-hydrogen-phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4) at 1.47 mM to demineralized water (dH2O) and adjust the pH to 6.8. Add 100 mL of 10x PBS to 900 mL of demineralized H2O to generate 1x PBS. Autoclave and store at room temperature (RT). Add sterile penicillin/streptomycin stock solution (10,000 U/mL penicillin and 10 mg/mL streptomycin [pen/strep]) to a final concentration of 1% prior to use.\nPrepare the hypotonic buffer by dissolving 1.21 g of Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris base) and 1 g of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in 1 L of dH2O (10 mM Tris base 0.1% EDTA). Use a magnetic stirrer until dissolved and adjust the pH to 7.8 with NaOH/HCl. Sterilize by autoclaving and store at RT. Add pen/strep to a final concentration of 1% prior to use.\nPrepare the hypotonic wash buffer by dissolving 1.21 g of Tris base in 1 L of dH2O (10 mM Tris base). Use a magnetic stirrer until dissolved and adjust the pH to 7.8 with NaOH/HCl. Autoclave and store at RT. Add pen/strep to 1% prior to use.",
    "Prepare the anionic detergent treatment by adding 0.05 g of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to 100 mL of hypotonic wash buffer to produce a 0.05% SDS treatment solution. Filter through a 0.22 µm membrane filter. Store at RT for up to 1 month.\n\tNOTE: The SDS solution should not be autoclaved, as SDS precipitates and degrades upon autoclaving.\nPrepare the DNase treatment solution by dissolving 1.21 g of Tris base in 0.5 mL of dH2O and add 1 mL of 1 M magnesium chloride (MgCl2). Adjust the pH to 7.8 with NaOH/HCl. Autoclave and store at RT. Add DNase I prior to use (50 U/mL).\n2. Sample collection\nNOTE: Wild-type C57/BL6 mice were utilized in the study. All techniques were conducted in a laminar flow hood under sterile conditions.\nEuthanize adult pregnant female mice at embryonic day (E) 18.5 of pregnancy using isoflurane inhalation followed by cervical dislocation. Subject the mice to terminal dissection to extract the fetuses.\n\t\nSpray the abdomen of the mouse with 70% ethanol.\nUsing surgical forceps and scissors, lift a fold of skin in the lower abdomen and make a U-shaped incision to expose the abdominal cavity18.\nCollect the uterine horns containing the E18.5 fetuses by cutting the oviducts and cervix and immediately transfer them to a Petri dish with ice-cold 1x PBS with 1% pen/strep18.\nQuickly remove the fetuses from the uterus and extraembryonic tissues and euthanize them by decapitation using scissors18.\nTransfer one fetus at a time to a Petri dish with ice-cold 1x PBS. Using a stereo microscope, remove the skin and cut off the limbs. From the ventral side, cut through the ribcage and remove the sternum and the underlying organs.",
    "Flip the fetal trunk dorsal side up. Remove the cervical portion of the vertebral column, the dorsal fat deposits, and the connective tissue on top of the deep back muscles.\nUse surgical forceps to anchor the ribcage and carefully scrape and detach the deep back muscles from the surrounding tissues using a micro scalpel10. This procedure results in the isolation of two muscle pieces per fetus (left and right), both primarily composed of longissimus and iliocostalis muscles, with some of the transversospinalis and levator costarum muscles included.\nStore the muscle samples in 1x PBS with 1% pen/strep at 4 °C for short-term storage (<1 week), or at -80 °C for longer periods.\n\t​NOTE: Use freshly collected samples for best results. Samples frozen for extended periods (>3 months) show lower decellularization efficiency and more protein degradation. Epaxial muscle masses were used for the decellularization experiments, but other muscles (e.g., limb muscles) can be processed for decellularization using the same protocol.\n3. Fetal skeletal muscle decellularization\nNOTE: All techniques were conducted in a laminar flow hood under sterile conditions. For a detailed schematic representation, see Figure 1A. All steps were performed with agitation in an orbital shaker with a diameter of 120 mm (165 rpm) at 25 °C unless stated otherwise. Add 1% pen/strep to solutions before use. When removing the solutions, aspirate carefully to avoid sample entrapment in the pipette.\nDay 1 - Prepare approximately 2 mm x 1 mm x 1 mm (~3.5 mg) tissue fragments from the epaxial muscle masses. Add 3 mL of hypotonic buffer with 1% pen/strep to each well of a 12-well plate and add one whole muscle tissue fragment per well.\n\t\nIncubate the tissue fragments in hypotonic buffer with agitation for 18 h (overnight) (O/N).",
    "Day 2 - Aspirate the hypotonic buffer using a fine-tip pipette and wash the samples 3 x 1 h with 3 mL of 1x PBS each time with agitation.\n\t\nIncubate the samples for 24 h with 3 mL of 0.05% SDS detergent solution with agitation.\n\t\tNOTE: (CHECK POINT) After SDS incubation, the samples should be transparent in appearance. The samples display a gelatin-like consistency and are, therefore, more prone to adhere to the pipette when removing the liquids.\nDay 3 - Remove the SDS detergent solution using a fine-tip pipette and wash the tissue fragments 3 x 20 min with 3 mL of hypotonic wash buffer each time with agitation.\n\tNOTE: (PAUSE POINT) The samples can be maintained in hypotonic wash buffer at 4 °C for 18 h (O/N). Ensure SDS is well removed during washing steps, as residual SDS can be cytotoxic.\n\t\nIncubate the tissue fragments for 3 h with 2 mL of DNase solution with agitation at 37 °C.\nRemove the DNase solution using a fine-tip pipette and wash the tissue fragments 3 x 20 min with 3 mL of 1x PBS each time with agitation. Finally, wash O/N with agitation (60 rpm).\n\t\tNOTE: After the DNase treatment, the dECMs become sticky due to the presence of DNA residues. Therefore, careful washing is necessary.\nStore the dECMs in 1x PBS with 1% pen/strep at 4 °C until recellularization (<1 week). For other uses, store at -80 °C.\n4. Decellularization quality assessment\nNOTE: DNA quantification, DAPI/methyl green staining, and phalloidin staining were performed to evaluate the presence of residual cell contents after decellularization. Immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses were conducted to assess the retention of key ECM proteins after decellularization.\nQuantification of the DNA present in the dECM",
    "NOTE: The dECMs should be compared to the native tissue to detect the presence of DNA.\n\t\nPrior to decellularization, weigh a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube on a high precision digital scale. Before transferring the muscle sample to the tube, remove all the remaining 1x PBS using a paper towel. Weigh the tube with the sample. Calculate the wet weight of the samples using equation (1):\n\t\t​Samplewet weight = weighttube with samples- weightempty tube      (1)\nDecellularize the samples following the protocol described in section 3.\nPlace the samples in 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\n\t\tNOTE: The samples can be kept at -20 °C until DNA extraction and quantification.\nPerform DNA extraction of the dECMs and native tissue samples using a spin column-based kit. Add the digestion buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nHomogenize the samples in a bead mill twice for 2.5 min each time (flipping the mounts) using one tungsten carbide bead per tube (use chilled tube mounts).\nAdd proteinase K and incubate O/N with slow agitation at 56 °C.\nProceed with the protocol as described in the manufacturer's instructions.\nElute with the buffer provided by the manufacturer and centrifuge 2 x 1 min at ≥6,000 x g, each time at 4 °C to increase the DNA yield.\n\t\tNOTE: DNA can be stored at -20 °C until quantification.\nQuantify the DNA present in the samples using a fluorescent dsDNA detection kit following the manufacturer's instructions.\nNormalize the DNA content as nanograms of DNA per milligram of original wet weight of sample.\nAnalyze the data using a two-tailed Student's t-test and express as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM).\nImmunohistochemistry",
    "NOTE: Solutions 1, 2, and 3 and the fixative solution should be prepared before use and can be kept frozen for up to 6 months. All antibodies and dyes used and respective dilutions are listed in Table 1.\n\t\nPreparation of solutions\n\t\t\nPrepare fixative solution by adding 2 g of paraformaldehyde (PFA), 8 g of sucrose, and 24 µL of 1 M CaCl2 to 77 mL of 0.2 M Na2HPO4 and 23 mL of 0.2 M NaH2PO4, to a final volume of 200 mL by adding dH2O. Adjust the pH to 7.4.\nPrepare 0.12 M phosphate buffer by adding 13.5 g of Na2HPO4 and 3.2 g of NaH2PO4 to 1 L of dH2O. Adjust the pH to 7.4.\nPrepare solution 1 by adding 4 g of sucrose to 100 mL of 0.12 M phosphate buffer.\nPrepare solution 2 by adding 15 g of sucrose to 100 mL of 0.12 M phosphate buffer.\nPrepare solution 3 by adding 15 g of sucrose and 7.5 g of gelatin to 100 mL of 0.12 M phosphate buffer. Heat at 37 °C until the gelatin dissolves.\nPrepare methyl green stock solution (2% methyl green powder dissolved in dH2O)19.\nImmunodetection\n\t\t\nFix the samples using the fixative solution for at least 4 h at 4 °C.\nWash the samples 2x for 10 min with 1x PBS.\nKeep O/N, or over 1 day, in solution 1 at 4 °C.\nWash and keep O/N or over 1 day in solution 2 at 4 °C. Let the samples warm to RT.\nIncubate for 3 h in solution 3 at 37 °C. Keep extra solution 3 at 37 °C to be used later.",
    "Mold small (2 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm) containers in aluminum foil. Place a thin layer of solution 3 in the molded container and let it set. Place the samples on the solidified solution 3 and cover with warm solution 3. Orientate the samples and let them solidify. Mark the location on the solidified solution 3 with a color pen.\nFreeze by placing the containers on the surface of dry ice-chilled or liquid nitrogen-chilled isopentane.\nUsing optimal cutting temperature (O.C.T.) compound, fix the frozen gelatin cubes containing the samples to the cryostat mount.\nSection the frozen gelatin cubes and transfer the tissue sections to the slides. Let them dry for 60 min.\nUse a hydrophobic marker to trace a line around the sections.\nWash the slides 3 x 10 min in 1x PBS.\nCover the sections with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1% goat serum, and 0.05% Triton X-100 diluted in 1x PBS (blocking solution) for 30 min (blocking step).\nDilute the primary antibodies in blocking solution and cover the sections. Incubate O/N at 4 °C in a closed box, with moist paper, to prevent the sections from drying.\nWash the slides 3 x 10 min with 1x PBS.\nDilute the secondary antibodies in blocking solution and cover the sections. Incubate for 1.5 h at RT in the dark.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Avoid light exposure to prevent fluorophore degradation.\nWash the slides 3 x 10 min with 4x PBS.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Higher concentration of PBS can be used when a strong background is present.\nSubmerge the slides in DAPI solution (5 µg/mL 1,4-diazabicyclo-2,2,2-octane in 0.1% Triton X-100/1x PBS) for 30 s each.\nRinse in 1x PBS.",
    "Mount the sections in anti-fading medium (50 mg/mL n-propyl-gallate in 1x PBS:glycerol [1:9]) and seal with a coverslip. Store at 4 °C until observation and image acquisition in a fluorescence microscope20.\n\t\t\tNOTE: For the in toto immunohistochemistry experiments, the same protocol (see steps 4.2.2.12-4.2.2.18) was used, except the samples were previously fixed in 4% PFA diluted in 1x PBS for 3 h at RT. DNA staining was performed by adding methyl green to the secondary antibody solution. All antibodies and dyes used, and their respective dilutions, are listed in Table 1. Samples were then mounted in anti-fading medium between two coverslips separated by steel rings, glued together with beeswax, and 100 µm image stacks were acquired using a confocal microscope21.\nWestern blot analysis\n\tNOTE: All antibodies used and respective dilutions are listed in Table 1.\n\t\nPreparation of solutions\n\t\t\nPrepare the 2x SDS-PAGE loading buffer by adding 20 mL of glycerol, 4 g of SDS, and 0.2 mL of bromophenol blue to 80 mL of 100 mM Tris base solution.
