    "Animal preparationAuditory Brainstem Response (ABR) recordings are recorded from anesthetized control and mutant mice. Mice are anesthetized using intra-peritoneal Ketamine (100 mg/kg) and Xylazine (10 mg/kg), see Recipe 1.After injection, mice are kept in a warm sleep cage until deeply sedated (when the righting reflex, corneal-blink reflex and pedal-withdrawal reflex are abolished; which may take from 5-10 minutes following injection) and then placed on a heating blanket located inside the sound attenuating booth where the electrophysiological recordings will take place. To speed up the procedure, the feedback probe is not inserted rectally, but instead is situated inside the blanket cover underneath the mouse. The blanket controller is set to maintain a temperature of 37 °C to ensure the mouse core temperature is not adversely affected during the recording. The induction anaesthetic dose is usually sufficient for the duration of the recording procedure but can be topped-up if necessary, using 30-50% doses.Sub-cutaneous needle electrodes (bent into a hook shape; Figure 1A) are inserted through a pinch of skin on the cranial vertex (connected to the active channel 1 input of the RA4LI or Medusa4Z headstage) and overlying the ventral region of the left bulla (connected to the headstage reference input) and right bulla (connected to the headstage ground input) (see Figures 1B and 1C). This electrode arrangement does not abolish artifact potentials (such as the electrocardiogram (ECG), but does minimize them. The hook shape facilitates an accurate insertion point and ensures that the recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is picked up from a limited anatomical area. No local anesthetic needs to be applied prior to electrode insertion as the mice are already deeply sedated and areflexic.",
    "Stimuli are presented as free-field sounds (not coupled into the ear-canal) from a loudspeaker whose leading edge is positioned 20 cm in front of the mouse’s interaural axis on the midline. This distance gives sufficient space to easily swap mice in and out of the set-up without accidently dislodging the loudspeaker position, whilst maintaining close proximity to ensure 95 dB SPL levels can be achieved at the mouse head position.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191202/20191202224031_7910.jpgFigure 1. Subcutaneous electrode shape and placement. (A) Individual needle electrodes are bent into a square hook shape using a needle holder, with each side approxiamtely 2 mm long. The hook is inserted through a pinch of skin, such that the contact with the subdermal layers lies on the remaining straight shaft of the electrode. A ground electrode is placed in the skin overlying the bulla behind the right ear (B). The active electrode for the low-impedance bio-amplifier is placed on the midline in a rostro-caudal position lined up with the leading edge of the 2 pinnae (C). The reference electrode for the bio-amplifier is inserted behind the left ear (D), in an equivalent location to the ground electrode (modified from Ingham et al., 2011).Stimulus generationStimuli are generated under the control the “Averager” software package. A wide range of stimulus parameters are user-definable, or can be easily and quickly loaded from previously saved configurations.The frequency response of the sound delivery system is equalized using a spectral analysis of the output of the non-equalized output of the system. The PCB microphone is positioned at a 20 cm distance from the leading edge of the loudspeaker (where the mouse head will subsequently be placed), pointing towards the loudspeaker. Under software control, broadband noise bursts (generated from random number sequences) are presented from the loudspeaker.",
    "The signal recorded by the microphone is amplified by 40 dB and recorded at approximately 200 kHz sampling rate on the RA6-A-P1 processor. The software calculates a Fast Fourier Transformation of the microphone signal to generate a frequency response representing the maximum output of the loudspeaker across frequency. This frequency response will be subsequently used by the software to calculate the dB attenuation level required to present each stimulus frequency at the desired dB sound pressure level (SPL). This step will need to be performed before the mouse is anesthetized and placed into the experimental setup within the sound attenuating booth. “Averager” software is used to control the RZ6-A-P1 processor to deliver click (0.01 ms duration) and tone pip (variable frequencies from 3-42 kHz of 5 ms duration, 1 ms rise/fall time) stimuli over a range of intensity levels from 0-95 dB sound pressure level (SPL, re. 5 μPa) in 5 dB steps. Stimuli are generated at a sampling rate of approximately 100 kHz before being attenuated, amplified and delivered to the sound transducer to produce the desired SPL at the mouse head location.Once triggered to begin, the “Averager” software and the RZ6-A-P1 processor control stimulus presentation and response recording synchronously. The same digital trigger is used to initiate both the presentation of each stimulus and the recording of response snippet evoked by that stimulus.Response recordingRecording electrophysiological responses is controlled by the same “Averager” software used to generate and present stimuli. A wide range of recording parameters are user-definable, or can be loaded from previously saved configurations.Activity detected by the subcutaneous electrodes is digitized at approximately 25 kHz sampling rate (RA4PA/Medusa4Z) before being passed optically to the bioamplifier input of the RZ6-A-P1 processor.",
    "Under control of the “Averager” software, the digitized electrode signal is captured, bandpass filtered (300 Hz-3 kHz; user definable) and amplified (user definable) before being upsampled to approximately 100 kHz. Snippets of response, 20 ms in duration, are stored in a digital averaging buffer before being retrieved by the software and saved to an output file in comma-separated variable (csv) text format.Averaged responses are recorded in response to 256 presentations of each stimulus (user definable) presented at 42.6/s (user definable).Stimulus parameter space and response recording protocolA test ABR trace is recorded first, to ensure the system is functioning correctly, using clicks at 70 dB SPL. This recording can easily be repeated if troubleshooting of the experimental setup is required. In addition to recording no response if the mouse is expected/known to be severely-profoundly impaired, there may be numerous other simple reasons that an evoked response is not seen; for example, the operator should check that a) the loudspeaker is properly connected, b) that the electrodes are properly connected to the mouse and headstage, c) that the electrode headstage and preamplifier are connected and switched on, d) there is no excessive electrical noise on the recording trace and e) that the mouse is still alive.A series of click-evoked ABRs are then recorded, ranging from 0-95 dB SPL in 5 dB intervals.Tone-evoked ABRs are recorded for a fixed set of frequencies (typically, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 kHz although the data collection can easily be expanded to capture responses to 3, 36 and 42 kHz tone-pips) over sound levels ranging from 0 to 95 dB SPL in 5 dB intervals. Responses are recorded in an array beginning with the lowest stimulus level, in decreasing frequency order before stepping up to the next (5 dB higher) stimulus level.",
    "Example ABR traces evoked by click and tone-pip stimuli across 0-95 dB SPL are shown in Figure 2, for a wildtype control mouse (with normal hearing), a mouse carrying a mutant allele of Ywhae (which induces a moderate degree of hearing impairment) and a mouse carrying a mutant allele of Minar2 (which induces a severe hearing impairment, such that no ABRs were evoked even at high stimulus levels).A final test trace is recorded, again using clicks at 70 dB, to ensure an equivalent ABR to the initial test trace is seen. This can be a helpful measure to determine if a mouse has deteriorated physiologically during the recording procedure.Recovery protocolFollowing completion of recording, the electrodes are removed from the skin and a drop of viscotears applied to each eye, to lubricate the cornea during recovery and help the general welfare of the mouse.Mice are injected with intra-peritoneal Atipamezole (1 mg/kg, see Recipe 2) to promote a faster recovery time from the anesthesia.Mice should be maintained in warmed cages until they are regaining mobility and judged sufficiently recovered to be returned to their home cage."
