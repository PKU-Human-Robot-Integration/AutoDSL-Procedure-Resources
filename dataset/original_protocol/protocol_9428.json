    "Frog manipulations were performed in accordance with the Canadian guidelines and have been approved by the ethics committee (CDEA, protocol #15-042) of University of Montréal.\n1. mRNA Preparation for fUAA Incorporation\nChoose a site of interest in the protein where conformational changes are expected to occur. Select an amino acid in this region to be substituted for the fUAA.\n\tNOTE: The choice of position is based on the structural rearrangements that are expected. If a high resolution structure exists and a hypothesis of the expected movements, the anap should be placed such that the chemical environment will alter; this might be either a change in the dielectric constant (hydrophobic versus hydrophilic environment) or, more likely, quenching by another amino acid. The best quenchers are tryptophans. Anap should be in contact with the quencher in one state (overlap of the van-der-Waals radii) and free of it in the other. If no high-resolution structures or models exist, one would have to scan the region of interest. In either case, it is advisable to select several nearby locations to increase the probability of obtaining expression and fluorescence signal. In order to minimize steric effects during protein maturation and/or function, one may choose to replace large and aromatic amino acids (Phe, Trp, Tyr). The authors, however, have experienced that scanning a region of interest for fUAA insertion regardless of the substituted amino acid, is more productive.\nInsert an amber stop codon (TAG) at the selected site using site-directed mutagenesis15. Ensure that the protein of interest does not end on an amber stop codon (TAG). If so, mutate to a different one (ochre or opal stop codon). Amplify, isolate and sequence the DNA. Obtain protein mRNA with in vitro transcription16 and store the mRNA at 20 °C or 80 °C.\n2. Oocyte Preparation and Injection",
    "Surgically obtain Stage V or VI oocytes from Xenopus laevis frogs and defolliculate with collagenase as previously described17.\nAnesthetize frogs with an appropriate anesthetic according to the approved animal protocol (here: 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester). When they fail to respond to a gentle pinch to a toe-tip (loss of withdrawal reflex), then they are suitably anesthetized for surgery.\nImmediately remove the frogs from the anesthetic solution and thoroughly rinse its skin with fresh water. This rinse will prevent the animal from falling into deeper levels of anesthesia by removing unabsorbed chemical from the skin surface.\nRemove ovary nodes from one side surgically and carefully open the nodes using two forceps. Incubate and agitate the oocytes in \"standard oocyte solution\" (SOS) containing 1% (w/v) collagenase for 20-30 min to defolliculate. Wash three times with SOS solution.\nSelect large and healthy oocytes individually and incubate them in Barth's solution supplemented with antibiotics (100 U/mL penicilin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, 10 mg/100 mL kanamycin) and 5% horse serum at 18 ͦC  for at least 4 h before injection.\n\t\tNOTE: After 2 - 4 surgeries with a 4 month delay in between, Xenopus laevis are euthanized by prolonged (>1 h) incubation with 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester.\nFor nuclear injection of DNA, prepare a long and thin injection tip to be able to reach the nucleus and to avoid damaging the oocyte. Fill the injection tip with oil and mount it on the nanoinjector device.\nInstall the nano-injector under a stereo microscope and use forceps to break the end of the tip. Eject oil until there is no air bubbles trapped inside the end of the tip.",
    "Place 1 µL of 0.1 µg/µL pAnap in nuclease-free water containing NaOH (1% of 1 N NaOH) on a piece of parafilm under a stereoscope and fill the injection tip with the DNA.\nTransfer 40 oocytes to a mesh-coated injection dish containing Barth's solution supplemented with antibiotics.\n\tNOTE: To make the mesh-coated injection dish, cut out an appropriately sized piece of 800 µm nylon mesh to fill a polystyrene Petri dish. Add chloroform to the center and then place the mesh on top. Hold the mesh flat until the plastic sets.\nAs the oocyte nucleus is located in the animal (dark) pole, aim the injection tip at the center of the animal pole and impale such that the tip reaches near the center of the animal hemisphere (or 2-3x the depth compared to RNA injection). Inject 9.2 nL of pAnap into the nucleus of each oocyte. The thin tip and small injection volume may result in irregular injection or blocked tip. Occasionally check whether the injection works by injecting into the air.\n\tNOTE: Whether the DNA gets properly injected into the nucleus is uncertain. Expect therefore 10 - 40% of the oocytes to not express the tRNA/synthetase pair. See Discussion for further elaboration.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55598/55598fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: Illustration of DNA and RNA Injection into Xenopus Oocytes for Anap Incorporation.",
    "First, pAnap is injected into the nucleus of the Xenopus oocyte (1). After 6-24 h, Anap and channel RNA are coinjected into the vegetal pole (2). Anap will be orthogonally aminoacylated with the tRNA bearing an amber stop anti-codon, by the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase which is encoded by pAnap. This way, the aminoacylated Anap-tRNAs are recognized by the ribosome at the inserted amber stop codon in the channel RNA, resulting in suppression of the stop codon and insertion of Anap.

Work only under red light from this point to prevent photobleaching of the Anap.\nMix 1 µL of 1 mM Anap with 1 µL of 1-2 µg/µL mRNA directly on a piece of parafilm and fill the injection tip with the mixed solution. Impale just below the membrane in the vegetal (bright) pole and inject 46 nL in each pAnap-injected oocyte.\n\tNOTE: The required mRNA concentration depends on the protein of interest.\nIncubate the oocytes protected from light in a box or wrapped in aluminium foil, in Barth's solution supplemented antibiotics and 5% horse serum at 18 °C for 2-3 days. Exchange with fresh Barth's solution every day and remove dead oocytes to avoid contamination.\n3. VCF Setup\nInstall the cut-open oocyte voltage-clamp equipment as previously described18.",
    "Mount the electrophysiology recording system on an upright fluorescence microscope by installing the recording chamber on a slider that allows moving it between the standard stereoscope for placing the oocyte and the microscope to perform the fluorescence measurements (Figure 2c).\n\tNOTE: The geometry of the chamber for cut-open oocytes is not suitable to use the normal transmitted light for illumination during manipulation. Therefore, a \"gooseneck\" halogen lamp with red filter is used to illuminate sideways from the top. The condenser of the microscope can be removed make space to lower the stage for the electrophysiology chamber.\nConnect a photodiode detection system to the C-mount exit port of the fluorescence microscope (Figure 2a). Connect the photocurrent readout to a second input channel in the digital signal processor (DSP, analog/digital – digital/analog converter).\nUse a 100 W, 12 V halogen lamp as light source for the fluorescence excitation.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, Hg-burners may be used, but have to be reduced in intensity to prevent too rapid photobleaching during recordings. LED illumination is only recommended if the respective LEDs show significant intensity in the excitation range (e.g., ~350 nm for Anap). Most white LEDs do not reach far into the UV spectrum.\nInsert an electrically-controlled shutter between excitation light source and microscope and connect its control (typically TTL-pulse) to a digital output of the DSP. Time the TTL-pulse in the recording software (see manufacturer documentation), such that the shutter opens ~100 ms before the beginning of the recording. This way, any vibration during the opening process does not interfere with the recording. The time depends on the speed and vibration of the shutter. End the pulse 5ms before the end of the recording as shown in Figure 4. This way, the value for the total fluorescence is also recorded.",
    "Insert an appropriate filter cube (excitation filter, dichroic mirror and emission filter) in the filter cube turret. For Anap, use Ex: 377/50 nm bandpass, dichroic 409 nm longpass, and Em: 470/40 nm bandpass.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55598/55598fig3.jpg\nFigure 3: VCF setup. (A) Side view of the VCF setup showing the light path inside the microscope. The filter cube contains an excitation filter, dichroic mirror and an emission filter. (B) Selected oocyte chamber dimensions are 3.4 cm for upper chamber radius (1), 5.5 cm for bottom chamber length (2), 1.4 cm for bottom chamber width (3) and 1.7 cm for middle chamber width (4). (C) Front view of the VCF setup. The first ocular on the left is for mounting the oocyte in the cut-open voltage clamp chamber and for permeabilization. Then, the chamber is slid under the microscope at the second ocular to the right. Here, the V1 electrode is inserted into the oocyte using the 4X objective, and fluorescence is recorded using the water-immersion 40X objective. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55598/55598fig3large.jpg]\n4. VCF Recording\nFollow preparation steps for cut-open oocyte voltage-clamp as previously described and visualized18 (agar bridge preparation, mounting the oocyte, saponin permeabilization). However, work under red light at all time to avoid bleaching the fluorophore prior to recordings. When placing the oocyte, make sure that the animal pole faces upwards. The pigmentation under the animal pole membrane shields against autofluorescence originating from the cytosol and therefore reduces background fluorescence.\nSlide the chamber over to the microscope and focus using a 4X objective.\nImpale the oocyte with the voltage sensing V1 electrode (3 M KCl), switch to the 40X water-immersion (NA 0.8 - 0.9) objective. Focus on the animal pole which is facing upwards.",
    "Turn off the red light. Select the right filter cube by turning the filter cube turret and the optical exit port connected to the photodiode. Turn on the halogen lamp at highest intensity and shortly switch the shutter open for 2-5 s to read the background fluorescence intensity originating from the oocyte. With the described setup the value should be around 50-200 pA for Anap.\nTurn on the clamp, flip the bath/guard switch to active and adjust the membrane potential (V1 - V2) to the command potential by turning the knob on the I headstage.\nSelect holding potential, step protocol, number and length of pulses etc. in the recording software. Record voltage-dependent currents and Anap fluorescence intensities.\n5. Two-color VCF\nTo monitor two locations in the same protein simultaneously, mutate an extracellular and accessible amino acid into cysteine, and remove other cysteines to ensure specific labeling with thiol-chemistry.\nPerform step 2.1-2.5.\nPrior to VCF recordings, incubate oocytes in 5 µM TMR-maleimide in labeling solution for 15 min (or other dye with non-overlapping spectra compared to Anap).\nWash the oocytes with labeling solution three times to remove excess dye.\nPerform step 4.1-4.6.\nInsert an appropriate filter cube for TMR (excitation filter, dichroic mirror and emission filter) in the filter cube turret. Switch to the TMR filter cube by turning the filter turret.\nRead the background fluorescence for TMR as described for Anap in step 4.4.",
    "NOTE: Labeling with thiol-chemistry results in high background fluorescence due to unspecific labeling in the membrane. Therefore, the TMR background fluorescence may saturate the amplifier (>2,000 pA). In that case, do not decrease the light intensity, but simply subtract the background fluorescence by adding an offset current to the photodiode. In commercially available systems use the \"sample-and-hold\" feature on the detector system. Note the background fluorescence value (using a 10X neutral density filter) in a laboratory journal, as this value will not be recorded (saturation).\nRecord voltage-dependent currents and TMR fluorescence intensities simultaneously as in step 4.6.\nSubscription Required.
