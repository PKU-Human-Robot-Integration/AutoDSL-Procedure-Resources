    "MS2 tagging and growing the yeast cell cultureThe MS2 aptamer is a short RNA stem-loop (SL) structure originating from the MS2 bacteriophage. MS2 tagging, i.e., inserting 12-24 repeats of the MS2-SL, allows the visualization and pulldown of endogenously tagged mRNAs using MCP fused to a fluorescent protein, like GFP (Figure 2). Addition of the SBP moiety allows for the pulldown of MCP-GFP using immobilized streptavidin. However, to identify nonspecific signals during the pull-down experiments several controls are needed, such as untagged cells and cells tagged with a control mRNA.Tag the gene of interest with MS2 aptamer a multiple binding sites for the RNA-binding MS2 coat protein (MCP), using a PCR-based genomic-tagging strategy and homologous recombination as previously described (Haim et al., 2007; Haim-Vilmovsky and Gerst, 2009). See also Note 1.Transform the strain having the gene tagged with MS2 aptamer with plasmids expressing the MCP-GFP-SBP using standard yeast LiOAc transformation (Gietz and Schiestl, 2007), and plate on SC-His synthetic media agarose plate.Pick a single colony that has been transformed with MS2-CP-GFP-SBP containing the HIS3 selection marker, inoculate it into a 50-mL test tube with 7-8 mL of selective medium (SC-His), and grow in a shaking incubator at 30°C for 6-10 h.Dilute to 500 mL culture for an overnight culture. For cells at mid-logarithmic phase, the final OD600 the next morning should be between 0.4-0.8. Cultures at different OD600 values can be used if other cell states are required, but further steps may need modification according to the amount of cells obtained. To calculate the starter culture volume to take, follow these steps:Measure the cell number or OD600 of a culture and determine the doubling time using the formula below. For the wild-type strain (BY4741) used in this experiment, the doubling time was 2 h.",

Collect the cells by centrifugation at 1,100 × g for 5 min at 4°C, using a SLA3000-type rotor in a Sorvall centrifuge, and discard the growth medium.Resuspend the cell pellet by gentle pipetting (do not vortex) in 200 mL of fresh growth medium lacking methionine, transfer to 1 L flask, and incubate at 30°C for 45 min with shaking to induce the expression of the MS2-CP-GFP-SBP. See also Note 2.Fix the cells with formaldehyde by directly adding 270 μL of formaldehyde to a final concentration of 0.05%, and incubate at room temperature (RT) with slow shaking for 10 min.Terminate the cross-linking reaction by adding 25 mL of glycine solution to a final concentration of 0.125 M and incubate for an additional 2 min.Centrifuge the cells, discard the supernatant according to chemical waste procedures at your institute, and resuspend the cells using a pipette (do not vortex) in 10 mL of PBS in a 50 mL tube.Centrifuge the cells at 2,500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.Discard the PBS completely and keep the tube inverted for 1-2 min on tissue paper to remove residual PBS.Quickly freeze the cell pellet using liquid nitrogen. For storage, transfer the cells to a -80°C freezer.",
    "The cells may be stored for prolonged periods under these conditions.Yeast Cell LysisNote: All the steps mentioned below should be performed on ice. Place the frozen cell pellet on ice and thaw by adding 4 mL of complete yeast lysis buffer.Once the cells are thawed, transfer 0.7 mL into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes prefilled with a volume of 0.5 mL of acid-prewashed and oven-baked glass beads.Vortex the cells using the disruptor for 20 min at 4°C at maximum speed. Turn off the shaker and let stand for 5 min to prevent excessive heating, then turn on for an additional 20 min.Centrifuge microfuge tubes in a bench-top centrifuge precooled to 4°C at 1,000 × g for 2 min. Transfer the supernatant into fresh microfuge tubes, and centrifuge again at 15,000 × g for 10 min.Collect the supernatants from each sample (i.e., each individual culture) into disposable 15 mL test tubes. Around 4 mL of supernatant is obtained after centrifugation. Measure the protein concentration with the BCA protein assay kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Transfer the total amount of protein extract desired for RaPID-seq/MS (typically 80-100 mg per pulldown are used for an RaPID-seq or RaPID-MS experiment, whereas 5-10 mg are used for simple pulldowns for qRT-PCR or Western analysis) to a fresh 15 mL tube, add the avidin solution (10 μg of avidin per 1 mg of protein extract), and incubate at 4°C for 1 h with constant rotation/shaking. This step is done to block any biotinylated protein from binding to the streptavidin beads. See Notes 3 and 4 regarding protein measurements and the required amounts for each type of experiment.Separate the amounts desired for the isolation of RNA and protein into different tubes. In addition, place aside two tubes, each with 1% of initial amount of total extract.",
    "One tube is used for “input RNA” (proceed to Step 14 for RNA isolation), and can be used to normalize for gene expression when performing either qRT-PCR or Nanostring experiments (see Note 5). The other tube will be used for “input protein” (proceed to Step 15). These samples are kept on ice and processed in parallel to the eluate, or can be kept frozen at -80°C until used.In parallel, aliquot 30 µL of streptavidin-conjugated beads. Wash the beads twice by adding 1 mL of ice-cold PBS; once in lysis buffer, swirl (do not vortex) 2-3 times, and centrifuge at 1,000 × g. Block the beads for 1 h at 4°C with 2% BSA and tRNA (0.1 mg per 100 μL of beads) prepared in lysis buffer. After 1 h, centrifuge and wash once with lysis buffer.Discard the buffer from the washed beads, add the avidin-blocked total cell extract to the beads along with 0.1 mg of yeast tRNA, and incubate at 4°C for 2 h to overnight with constant rotation.Centrifuge the tubes at 1,000 × g for 2 min and remove the supernatant. Transfer the beads to 1.7 mL tubes and wash them three times with lysis buffer and twice with washing buffer, with centrifugation (as above) between washes.Perform a last wash in ice-cold PBS and remove the excess buffer.Add 150 μL of the biotin elution solution to the beads, and incubate for 1 h at 4°C with rotation, for elution of the mRNA-protein/RNA complexes from the beads.Centrifuge at 1,000 × g for 2 min, transfer the eluate into a fresh microfuge tube, centrifuge once again, and transfer the eluate into a new tube to assure that no beads were carried over.",
    "To reverse crosslink the fraction destined for RNA isolation, add an equal volume of the cross-link reversal buffer to the eluate and incubate at 70°C for 45 min.To reverse crosslink the fraction destined for protein isolation, add an appropriate volume of the 5× protein sample buffer to reach the 1× concentration, and incubate at 70°C for 45 min.De-crosslinked RNA and protein samples can be kept at -20°C."
