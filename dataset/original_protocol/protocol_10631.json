    "1. Fabrication of Parylene Patterns on SiO2: Process Flow (See Figure 1)\nDesign desired parylene-C configuration using a layout editor software package, capable of reading/writing CIF (Caltech Intermediate Form) or GDS-II (Graphic Database System-II) files. CIF and GDS-II are industry standard file formats for integrated circuit artwork layout.\nCommission photo mask manufacture to an appropriate microelectronics facility, or make in-house if facilities exist.\nOxidize a silicon wafer in an atmospheric horizontal furnace (H2 1.88 SLM and O2 1.25 SLM) at 950 °C for 40 min to produce a 200 nm SiO2 layer (confirm thickness with a small spot spectroscopic reflectometer).\nPrime the oxidized wafer with a silane adhesion promoter. Now deposit parylene-C at 22 °C at a rate of 1.298 nm/mg of dimer using a vacuum deposition system specifically designed to deposit parylene. A 100 nm thick parylene-C coating was used for all examples shown below.\nNext deposit hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) adhesion promoter on the parylene-coated wafer using a suitable photo-resist coating system.\nNow spin the wafer at 4,000 rpm for 30 sec whilst applying positive photo-resist (resulting in a theoretical thickness of 1 μm), using the same photoresist coating system as above.\nSoft bake the wafer for 60 sec at 90 °C.\nInsert both the wafer and premanufactured photo mask into a mask aligner.\nExpose the photoresist-coated wafer with a UV negative representation of the desired parylene-C configuration.\nBake exposed wafer for 60 sec at 110 °C.\nRemove all exposed photo-resist from the wafer by developing in an appropriate developer solution.\nEtch off the unprotected parylene. Use an oxygen plasma etch system (at a 50 mTorr chamber pressure, 49 sccm O2, 100 W RF power at 13.56 MHz, and an etch rate of 100 nm/min) to reveal the underlying SiO2.",
    "Dice the wafer using an appropriate dicing saw (spindle speed 30,000 rpm, feed speed 7 mm/sec).\nRinse chips in deionized H2O and blow dry with nitrogen.\nStore chips (indefinitely) in dust free boxes until required.\n2. Chip Cleaning and Activation: Protocol\nRemove residual photoresist from chips by washing in acetone for 10 sec.\nRinse in deionized distilled H2O 3x.\nMake up fresh piranha acid (a 5:3 ratio of 30% hydrogen peroxide and 98% sulfuric acid).\n\tCAUTION: Prepare piranha acid with great care. It is an extremely powerful oxidizer, is strongly acidic, and mixing hydrogen peroxide with sulfuric acid is an exothermic reaction. Perform this stage in an acid fume hood. Allow 2 min to pass after mixing the piranha acid but use within 20 min.\nClean and etch chips by immersion in piranha acid for 10 min.\nRinse chips 3x in deionized H2O and transfer to a sterile culture dish.\nNow activate chips for cell patterning. For example, add two chips per well to a 6-well plate and then add 2 ml of fetal bovine serum so as to fully immerse all chips. Perform this, and all subsequent cell culture stages, under sterile conditions in a laminar flow tissue culture hood.\nIncubate chips in serum for 3-12 hr at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: Steps 2.4-2.7 should be performed sequentially and without delay between steps. If serum activation is delayed by ≥24 hr after piranha-treatment, cell patterning is impaired due to reduced cell repulsion from SiO2 regions.\n\tAlternative activation solutions containing specific cell adhesion proteins can be used in place of fetal bovine serum. Such solutions alter the cell-adhesion characteristics of the two contrasting substrates (see representative results for an example).\n3. Plating Cell Lines On-chip: Protocol",
    "Remove chips from their activation solution and wash once for 10 sec in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution.\nPlace chip in a culture well and plate chosen cell type as a suspension in its usual growth media. Optimum cell plating density depends both on cell type and geometric pattern of parylene-C on-chip. A density of 5 x 104 cells/ml is a sensible starting point.\nImaging is tailored to the underlying motivation for cell patterning but live cell behavior can easily be assessed using a dissecting microscope and a digital camera with a suitable relay lens."
