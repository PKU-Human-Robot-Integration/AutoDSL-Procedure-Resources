    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nViral injection of GCaMP6s + RFP into trigeminal ganglia (TG) of mice\nTiming: the total procedure duration is approximately 40–60 min per animal. This time includes anesthesia induction, animal and surgical area preparation, cranium drilling, viral mixture injection into trigeminal ganglia, and scalp suturing.\nThis section describes in detail the technical steps required for mice surgery, in which the viral mixture is injected into trigeminal ganglia to express the genetic calcium indicator GCaMP6s and RFP tracer in the corneal nerve endings and terminal fibers. The injection coordinates are determined such that the viruses will infect the ophthalmic segment (V1) of the ganglion, which contains peripheral afferent nociceptive sensory neurons innervating the cornea (modified from (Whitehead et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13])).\nThis stage allows for performing the main experiment, which is detection, characterization, and imaging corneal nociceptive terminals in vivo.\nSterilize the surgical tools using the glass bead dry sterilizer (specified in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nAnesthetize a 4–6 weeks old adult male mouse by intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 100 μL of anesthesia mixture (described above in preparations for viral injection[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.1] section, step 3).\nShave the top of the mouse scalp.\nPlace the mouse in the stereotactic frame on a heating pad set at 37°C.\nAttach the teeth to the mouthpiece.\nAssemble the nose cone connected to the isoflurane vaporizer. Set vaporizer to 2% for anesthesia induction. Set the oxygen flow rate in the vaporizer to 350–400 mL/min.\nApply eye ointment (synthomycine, specified in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) to both eyes to avoid dryness which could cause eye irritation.\nMonitor pain reflexes by observing the responses to paw pinching.\nOnce the anesthesia level is achieved and reflexes are diminished, decrease the isoflurane percentage to 0.4%–0.6% for anesthesia maintenance.\nVisually monitor the breathing rate during the entire procedure.",
    "Note: The breathing rate is expected to be around 55–85 breaths per minute. If abrupt changes in the breathing rate occur, reevaluate the pain reflex, and readjust the anesthesia levels by slightly increasing the isoflurane percentage at the vaporizer.\nStabilize and fix the head in the stereotactic frame using non-rupture ear bars.\nInject meloxicam subcutaneously (SC) for pain relief at a concentration of 1.32–1.65 mg/kg (see preparations for viral injection[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.1] section, step 5).\nUse hair removal cream for removing the remaining fur after shaving. Clean and sterilize the scalp with alternating swabs of 70% ethanol and 10% povidone iodine (specified in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]), and then dry the area.\nMake a 1 cm midline incision to expose the Bregma and Lambda focal points.\nSeparate the scalp and the connecting tissues in the mediolateral axis, about 2.5–3 mm apart. To that end, use either surgical tweezers and scissors or a mini retractor.\nClean and dry the surface of the exposed bone by using triangle sponges and cotton swabs.\nDetermine Bregma and Lambda focal points by defining two points along an extrapolated straight line delineating the longitudinal sagittal suture, which intersects with an extrapolated continuous parabolic line delineating the anterior coronal suture (Bregma) and the posterior lambdoid suture (Lambda, Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1475-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Scheme of the drill hole locations for the viral injections into the V1 area of the trigeminal ganglion\nAttach the dental drill with its appropriate drill head (see the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) to the stereotactic holder, and mount it to the stereotactic apparatus.\nIn order to align Bregma and Lambda in the horizontal plane (z-axis), bring the drill to the Bregma focal point under the binocular and zero its position in the z-axis.\nBring the drill to the Lambda focal point, and measure its position.",
    "Note: no further changes are needed if the drill is still positioned at 0 ± 0.05 mm on the z-axis. Otherwise, fine-tune the stereotactic apparatus (by adjusting the mouthpiece, which affects the position of the head on the z-axis) such that Bregma and Lambda focal points are at the same horizontal plane.\nDetermine the locations of cranial drilling (to enable injecting the virus into the V1 area of the two TGs). The locations of the drilling holes (approximately 0.5 mm diameter) are according to the following coordinates: +0.4 mm ± 0.02 mm to Bregma on the anterior-posterior axis, and +/–1.35 ± 0.02 mm to Bregma on the mediolateral axis (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nAccording to the abovementioned coordinates (step 11), lower the dental drill slowly until the bone resistance diminishes, indicating the transition from bone to soft brain tissue. At this point, stop the drilling.\nWash the remaining bone and blood using saline (0.9% NaCl) and dry with swabs.\nFor injection of the viral mixture, replace the drill with a pipette holder. Mount the glass pipette into the holder, and connect it with a silicon tube to a 10 mL syringe.\nLoad 4.5 μL of the viral mixture with a 1–10 μL pipette (specified in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) onto a paraffin tape strip (Parafilm, specified in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]), creating a droplet.\nBring the parafilm strip with the viral mixture droplet under the fixed pipette.\nLoad the viral mixture into the pipette using negative pressure applied by the syringe.\nPlace the pipette filled with the viral mixture above the Bregma focal point. Confirm the Bregma to Lambda alignment as explained in step 10a-b, this time using the pipette instead of the dental drill.",
    "Lower the pipette into the drill hole to a final depth of –6.39 ± 0.04 mm, on the z-axis.\nInject 1–2 μL of the viral mixture per ganglion, at a rate of about 1 μL per 10 s.\nCritical: Injection of air through the pipette could be lethal. To avoid air injection, visually monitor the viral mixture's fluid level. Perform the injection only when the fluid level in the pipette can be observed, and it is higher than the margins of the drilled hole.\nCritical: Following the injection of the virus, the injection pipette should not be removed and should remain in place for a 5-minute pause time to allow pressure equalization.\nAfter 5 min, lift out slowly the glass pipette, and place it at the zero-reference point (Bregma).\nExamine the pipette tip integrity.\nIf pipette tip integrity is preserved, move the glass pipette to the second drill hole at the exact opposite coordinates in the x-axis for injecting the viral mixture into the second TG. If pipette tip integrity is not preserved, replace the pipette and repeat steps 13 and 14. Then move the glass pipette to the second drill hole at the exact opposite coordinates in the x-axis for injecting the viral mixture into the second TG.\nRepeat steps 15a–15c at the new location.\nWash and sponge the drill holes with saline 0.9%, and then dry.\nSuture the incision over the open dried and cleaned drill holes. Apply synthomycine over the sutured incision.\nInject the mouse with atipamezole 150 μL IP (see preparations for viral injection[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.1] section, step 6).\nFor animal recovery:",
    "Place the mouse in a cage under warming light and soothing conditions, and constantly monitor until the animal appears to recover (normal gait, grooming behavior, and overall appearance). An animal is considered to be recovered from anesthesia when a mouse can maintain himself upright and move purposefully.\nPut mouse into a separate cage for 2–3 days to recover from the surgical procedure and only then place it into a common cage with 2–4 littermates.\nMice are taken for imaging experiments 10–14 days post-viral injection.\nCritical: The 10–14-day experimental window was determined by performing a calibrating experiment on a separate group of mice to detect the optimal expression of the RFP tracer. These experiments were performed by monitoring RFP fluorescence in corneal nerve terminals using an epifluorescent microscope in anesthetized mice (as detailed in section calcium imaging of corneal nociceptive terminals, expressing GCaMP6s and RFP[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2]) every day following the viral injection. We found that the optimal expression of RFP in the corneal terminals and fibers depends on the viral titer and the injected amount. It is achieved at 10–14 days post-viral injection in the described conditions. This time window is also optimal for the recordings of GCaMP6s signals.\nCritical: Attempts to record from the terminals with prolonged post-injection periods allow clear RFP visualization, but in all cases, show low, if at all, evoked GCaMP6s fluorescence.\nCalcium imaging of corneal nociceptive terminals, expressing GCaMP6s and RFP\nTiming: 3–6 h per animal (the timing differs and depends on the pharmacological compounds applied and each experiment's aim).",
    "This section describes a detailed step-by-step process for wide-field epifluorescence and calcium imaging of single nociceptive terminals and distal fibers in the mouse cornea. Furthermore, this section describes the main principles governing the handling of the mouse, the optics, and the imaging apparatus, which enables data acquisition in precise spatial and temporal parameters.\nFor anesthesia, inject the mouse that has undergone viral injection, IP with 220–250 μL of the anesthesia mixture (described in step 3 of section preparations for viral injection[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.1]). Mice are considered anesthetized when there is no paw pinch reflex. It usually takes about 15 min.\nHydrate both eyes by applying approximately 10 μL SES per eye to avoid eyes dryness. The drop should stay on the non-imaged eye during the experiment. If the SES drop slips or vaporizes from the non-imaged eye, reapply the drop.\nPlace the mouse on a heating pad set to 37°C, located on a recording plate (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Stabilize its head with a three-point head stabilizer (SGM-4, Narishige, Japan, specified in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table], Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nTilt the head such that the imaged eye is in the horizontal plane (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2D), at an angle allowing placing the eye stabilizer and bath above it so that the bath can hold the solution (further checked and tuned in steps 21biii, 21bv).\nThe eye stabilizer and bath is held by a hemostat fixed to a Noga arm (specified in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]), attached to the recording plate (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nPlace the eye stabilizer over the mouse eye, and gently stretch the skin around the eyeball aside using two fingers to bulge out the eyeball.",
    "Carefully push the bulged eyeball through the hole of the eye stabilizer and bath (squeezed through, careful not to make any lateral movements which might lead to tissue damage, Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2D). The hole size of the eye stabilizer and bath (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) is as large as the eyeball or a bit smaller such that once the eyeball is squeezed through the hole, the solution does not leak out between the eye stabilizer and the eye (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nInspect to ensure that the eye stabilizer and bath is parallel to the horizontal plane. If this is not the case, lift the eye stabilizer gently and readjust it. It is also possible to adjust the angle of the mouse head if needed.\nFill the eye stabilizer and bath with SES (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2D).\nInspect again to ensure that there is no tilt of the chamber in relation to the horizontal plane. If the solution does not fill the eyecup in a homogenous manner around the eyeball, remove the solution and readjust, as explained above in 17biii.\nPlace the plate with the mouse on the microscope stage (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and C).\nUse an Exi Aqua (QImaging) monochromatic camera for wide-field epifluorescence image acquisition (bright field imaging and RFP fluorescence).\nCenter the cornea, and adjust the field of view via the eye-piece of the microscope using the 5X objective. At this stage, the eye is illuminated via an external LED light source attached to a gooseneck (LED gooseneck illuminator, see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]), and the microscope’s filter turret contains an empty filter box.",
    "Use a 40× water immersion high NA objective and RFP filter set (a 565 nm excitation LED and RFP filter set: Ex 560, Em 630, dichroic Lp 585; Chroma) to select a superficial terminal. Use a “live view” mode of the NIS elements imaging software (specified in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]). The RFP imaging is performed with an exposure time of 300–500 ms, binning of 2 × 2, and a hardware gain of 10–20. The light source is at maximal power, with 3.1 mW/cm2 flux at the focal plane of the objective. At this time point of the procedure, GCaMP6s basal fluorescence is non-detectable since intra-terminal calcium levels are low.\nUse the prepared glass pipette (as detailed in preparations for in vivo optical recording of calcium signals[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2] section, step 11) and fill it with the solution containing SES, capsaicin (500 nM) and SR101 (9 μM), as described above in the preparations for in vivo optical recording of calcium signals[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2] section, steps 9–10.\nDiscard the trapped air bubbles at the tip of the puff pipette by gently flicking the pipette before placing it in the Picospritzer holder.\nPlace the filled puff pipette into the Picospritzer holder attached to the Picospritzer holder adapter on the micromanipulator (SM7, described in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]), and control its movements via an external module.\nNote: The holder and the manipulator positions are calibrated to assure that the puff pipette tip has access to the cornea (see preparations for in vivo optical recording of calcium signals[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2] section, step 12).\nTo bring the loaded pipette to the terminal field of view, lift the 40× objective several hundreds of μm above the epithelial plane without changing its x and y coordinates and replace it with a 5× objective.",
    "Under the external light source, with the empty filter turret, bring the pipette above the bath solution to the objective focal plane and adjust the pipette tip to the center of the imaged field.\nPlace the 40× objective, and readjust the focal plane to bring the pipette tip into focus and to the center of the field of view.\nSwitch the optical pathway from the eye-piece to the QImaging camera, and set parameters to allow RFP fluorescence acquisition (detailed above, step 22b).\nPerform a short test puff to ensure that the pipette is not blocked or leaking. This test is done by monitoring the change in SR101 fluorescence (using RFP fluorescence acquisition parameters) around the pipette tip after applying a puff.\nTo position the loaded pipette in close proximity to the terminal of interest, using a micromanipulator (described above and in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]), gradually lower the objective (40×) and the pipette consecutively, starting with increments of 20–40 μm, narrowing the range when reaching closer to the terminal tip plane. Repeat this process until the pipette tip is placed 2–5 μm above the corneal surface (CRITICAL: without disturbing the cell layer) and approximately 10 μm in the x-y plane from the terminal end (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1475-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

    "(B) A representative trace of optical recordings of the change in GCaMP6s fluorescence, from the terminal at the ROI shown in A, acquired by the RedShirt camera, and analyzed using Turbo-SM imaging analysis software and Matlab program (see section quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis]), following a 1s application of 500 nM of capsaicin.\n(C and D) An exemplary experiment. (C) Representative traces of optical recordings of changes in GCaMP6s fluorescence following application of capsaicin (Before) and changes in GCaMP6s fluorescence following application of capsaicin to the same terminal and recorded from the same ROI, but during treatment with a drug (Treatment). (D) Analysis of the data from 5 different terminals assessed from 5 eyes from 5 mice. The data are represented as boxplots and individual paired values of the terminal peak fluorescence intensities (ΔI/I). The boxplots depict mean; 25th and 75th percentile and SD. The values of peak fluorescence intensities are obtained by normalizing the fluorescence intensity values measured during the experiment (ΔI) to the values of the baseline obtained 10 s before applying capsaicin (I). The effect of treatment on the peak fluorescence is measured from the same ROI at each terminal before and after treatment application. The values are then normalized to the values obtained before the treatment application. One sample t-test.\nStill using the parameters for detection of RFP fluorescence, change the optical pathway so that the fluorescent emission is directed towards the RedShirt camera (back-illuminated 80 × 80 pixels cooled and fast CCD camera). The RedShirt camera detection parameters are: 40–125 Hz acquisition rate, medium gain, and “live view” mode. Since the two cameras do not have the same optical pathway, and the field of view between them is very different in size, re-focus the microscope and bring the terminal to the center of the frame.",
    "For performing the GCaMP6s imaging (calcium imaging) of the selected terminal:\nSet GFP fluorescence parameters (a 490 nm excitation LED and GFP filter (Ex 480, Em 535, dichroic Lp 510; Chroma)). The light source is at maximal power and has 5.4 mW/cm2 flux at the focal plane of the 40× objective.\nFor detecting calcium-mediated changes in the GCaMP6s fluorescence, choose the regions of interest (ROIs) according to the examined compartment of nociceptive terminal and fiber:\nFor detecting calcium-mediated changes in the GCaMP6s fluorescence at the terminals, choose the regions of interest (ROIs) within 5–10 μm proximal to the terminal tip.\nFor detecting calcium-mediated changes in the GCaMP6s fluorescence at the fibers, choose the regions of interest (ROIs) within 15–30 μm proximal to the terminal tip.\nFor detecting calcium-mediated changes in the GCaMP6s fluorescence at the plexuses, choose the regions of interest (ROIs) within 60–100 μm proximal to the terminal tip.\nCritical: Regardless of the investigated areas (terminals, fibers, or plexuses), the application of capsaicin is always made above the terminal tip, as explained in step 25 above.\nThe ROI is visualized using the recording software (Turbo-SM), which is also used to trigger the puff and start recording the changes in GCaMP6s fluorescence.\nTurbo-SM, via the RedShirt camera’s analog-to-digital (A/D) converter, triggers a Digidata 1440 A/D interface (Molecular devices, specified in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]), which in turn triggers the picospritzer (Pneumatic PicoPump, specified in key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) to initiate the puff. The experimental parameters are set using the pClamp software (Molecular Devices, specified in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nThe experimental protocol is as follows: 1,000 ms recording before puff application, 1,000 ms puff duration, and 5,500 ms recording after puff ends.",
    "For focal puff application of capsaicin or vehicle, use a pipette with 4–6 MΩ resistance (when filled with SES, see the protocol detailed in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]) connected to a picospritzer (specified in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]). The parameters of the puff are: 1 s puff, 2 pounds per square inch (psi). These parameters have been devised after calibrating the dispersion profile of the puffed solution (Goldstein et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nPuff calibration: the dispersion profile of puffed substances was calibrated by measuring changes in sulfa-rhodamine 101 (SR101, 9 μM) fluorescent intensity profile, with distance, from the pipette tip according to\n   (Equation 1)     F  x 1 , y 1    F  x 0 , y 0    ×  C  x 0 , y 0   =   C  x 1 , y 1       \nwhere F is fluorescence intensity at x, y coordinates and C is the concentration.\nWe calibrated the puff characteristics to achieve a substantial decrease in fluorescence at a distance of about 15 μm from the pipette tip on the horizontal plane (y-axis), thus preventing an effect on neighboring terminals (Goldstein et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). According to the calibration parameters, we place the pipette about 10 μm from the terminal tip in the following experiments. Thus, in these conditions, the concentration of capsaicin at the terminal is close to the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of TRPV1 channels to capsaicin (∼150 nM (Yang et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14])). This is an estimated peak concentration during a 1 s puff, which dissipates in the medium when the puff ends. Additionally, considering that the minimal concentration of capsaicin to activate TRPV1 channels is ∼30 nM (Yang et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]), the prominent decrease in concentration along the y-axis renders the concentration mostly ineffective once it reaches other parts of the fiber or adjacent terminals.",
    "Following terminal activation, calcium-induced signals at designated ROIs are recorded using the Turbo-SM imaging software.\nImage data collected from the RedShirt camera are further processed and analyzed from selected ROIs (defined with a kernel size of two (2 × 2 pixels), using the NeuroPlex imaging analysis software) and other software and algorithms mentioned in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] and section quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1475-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. In vivo recording of electrical stimulation-evoked calcium signals in corneal nociceptive terminals\n(A) Epifluorescent image of the RFP expressed by a corneal terminal and the position of the stimulating electrodes. The orange arrow indicates the representative region of interest (ROI) from which the changes of the GCaMP6s fluorescence are recorded using the RedShirt camera.\n(B) A representative trace of optical recordings of change in GCaMP6s fluorescence from the terminal at the ROI shown in A, following 100 ms application of a “rheobase” current (150 μA).\nCritical: The puff pipette should not touch the corneal surface at any stage. If it does, replace the pipette and use a different terminal located far away (at least 100 μm) from the initial terminal (step 25 above).\nCritical: The puff pipette tends to move from its original and specific location after a puff. Therefore, when performing several puff applications to the same terminal, mark the pipette location (delineate the location of the tip on the image produced) before initiating the puff and return the pipette to its original location after each puff application.",
    "Optional: Electrical stimulation: To examine the activity of the terminals' voltage-gated channels, we have devised a way to stimulate a single terminal electrically. To that end, we apply field electrical stimulation via two pulled glass pipettes (tip diameter ∼10 μm, ∼50KΩ, Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], lower panel, see also the pipette pulling protocol, detailed in Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]) filled with SES and an Ag/AgCl electrode, which is threaded into each pipette. The electrodes are connected to an Iso-flex battery pack and controller (AMPI, specified in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]), commanded by the Digidata 1440 A/D interface (Molecular Devices, specified in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]). The stimulation current is assessed by adding a known resistor to the circuit and measuring its potential with an oscilloscope. The stimulating pipettes are placed slightly above (2–5 μm) the corneal surface, without disturbing the cell layer, at a distance of approximately 5–10 μm from the activated terminals, each stimulating pipette on opposing sides of a designated terminal (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A). For each terminal, a series of current stimuli are applied to determine a “rheobase” stimulus (the minimal stimulus that triggers an increase in the intra-terminal calcium). The “rheobase” stimulus is used throughout the experiment."
