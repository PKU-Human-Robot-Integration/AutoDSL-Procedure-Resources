    "Bacterial PHB stainingPellet down ca. 5 x 108 bacterial cells by centrifugation at 7,500 x g for 5 min at room temperature (ca. equivalent to 1 ml of an Escherichia coli liquid culture at an OD600 of 0.5).Notes: Note that lower amounts of cells will be subjected to the flow cytometric analysis, however, higher initial bacterial amounts are easier to handle during the centrifugation steps prior to staining.Include as a negative control for PHB measurements a bacterial population (ideally of the same species) grown under conditions that are not permissive for PHB accumulation (here referred to as PHB- bacteria), and a population of bacteria loaded with PHB (PHB+ bacteria) that has not been stained with Nile red, as a negative control for non-specific fluorescence.Centrifugation speed and time need to be adjusted in each particular case to optimize bacterial collection at the bottom of the tube, mainly depending on the viscosity of the supernatant.Wash the bacterial pellet once with 500 µl 1x PBS (see Recipes), and resuspend cells in 500 µl of permeabilization solution (see Recipes). Incubate the suspension at room temperature (RT) for 15 min.Collect the cells by centrifugation at 7,500 x g for 5 min at RT.Resuspend the pellet in 1 ml 1x PBS and dilute the bacterial suspension 1:100 with 1x PBS to a final volume of 1 ml (i.e., to reach a bacterial concentration of ca. 5 x 106 cells per milliliter). Mix well by vortexing for a few seconds.Add 20 µl of Nile red stock solution (see Recipes) to the diluted bacterial suspension. Mix well by vortexing for a few seconds and incubate protected from light at RT for 30 min.Note: Please note that, as reviewed by Alves et al.",
    "(2017), the concentration of Nile red that is required to optimally stain the bacterial PHB granules largely varies among species (i.e., from 0.032 µM for C. necator to 94.2 µM for E. coli). The concentration reported in this protocol has been shown to properly stain PHB in Sinorhizobium meliloti (Lagares Jr. et al., 2017). Nile red concentration and exposure time should be optimized for each bacterial species.Transfer samples to 12 x 75-mm 5 ml Falcon® test tubes and proceed to analyze them by flow cytometry as indicated in the following steps.Note: Since Nile red fluorescence starts to decay shortly after its addition (Alves et al., 2017), it is critical to measure all the samples at an equal time after they are stained.Flow cytometrySet the flow cytometer for cell excitation by the 488-nm-wavelength argon laser and Nile red fluorescence acquisition by the filter with bandwidth centered at 585 nm (on FL2 channel if using FACScalibur flow cytometer). Register Forward (FSC)- and side (SSC)-scattered light as well. Adjust FSC, SSC and FL2 detector voltages, if necessary. Set the sample flow rate at the low flow position (e.g., ca. 12 µl/sec).Notes: Carefully follow flow cytometer facility use guidelines (e.g., warm-up instructions, sheath and waste management).In general, setting FSC and SSC channel voltages to E02 and 300, respectively, would allow to clearly identify bacterial populations in FSCxSSC dot plots. FL2 channel voltage should be adjusted to maximize the difference of the median values corresponding to PHB+ and PHB- bacterial populations (e.g., FL2 channel voltage was set to 500 during acquisition of the data plotted in Figure 1).Analyze samples and controls with the flow cytometer. Record at least 100,000 events per sample."
