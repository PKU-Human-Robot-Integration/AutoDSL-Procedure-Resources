The protocol was adapted from the generation method for human CdHs (Kim et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nResuspend the mPHs in hepatocyte culture medium. Seed the freshly isolated mPHs on a collagen-coated plate at 2,000 cells/cm2 and incubate overnight (10–16 h) with 5% CO2 at 37°C.\nChange hepatocyte culture medium to the reprogramming medium. Change the reprogramming medium every two days.\nCulture the cells until they reach 75%–80% confluence (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nNote: Generation of CdHs is usually completed between 7 and 10 days. When cells reach 75%–80% confluence, move on to the passage stage.\nCritical: Confluence of CdHs greater than 75%–80% led to a decrease in cell proliferation capacity, passaging efficiency and differentiation capacity. Passage CdHs before the cells are over-confluent (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nPassage the cells at a ratio of 1:4\nPrewarm DPBS and TrypLE to room temperature (20°C–25°C). Prepare a collagen-coated plate, aspirate the collagen solution, wash the plate using DPBS, and add 7 mL of reprogramming medium (standard in 10 cm2 plate).\nAspirate the cultured medium and wash the cells with 2–3 mL DPBS.\nAdd 2 mL TrypLE Express Enzyme and incubate for 5 min at 37°C.\nDetach the cells by gently pipetting and transfer to a 15 mL tube with 7 mL of reprogramming medium.\nCentrifuge at 200 g for 5 min at 4°C and aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet with 4 mL reprogramming medium and seed 1 mL of cells into a prepared 10 cm2 plate.\nIncubate in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37°C.\nCryo-preservation\nCount 1 × 105 cells and add the reprogramming medium until the total volume is 900 μL.",
    "Add 100 μL DMSO and transfer each sample to a cryo-tube.\nPlace the cryo-tubes into a freezing container and store at −80°C deep freezer.\nNote: For longer storage, transfer samples to liquid nitrogen after one day\nThawing frozen CdHs\nPrewarm the reprogramming medium and water bath. Prepare a collagen-coated plate, aspirate the collagen solution, wash the plate using DPBS, and add 7 mL of reprogramming medium (standard in 10 cm2 plate).\nThaw the frozen CdHs in a 37°C water bath and slowly transfer into a 15 mL tube with prewarmed 9 mL reprogramming medium.\nCentrifuge at 200 g for 5 min at 4°C and aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL reprogramming medium and seed the cells into a prepared 10 cm2 collagen-coated plate.\nIncubate in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37°C.\nNote: Usually you can get the cells with 80%–90% viability after thawing. To increase the cell viability, change the medium after 1 day of thawing.\nHepatic differentiation\nTiming: 9 days\nThis step describes the differentiation of CdHs into hepatocyte-like cells (CdH-Heps). The protocol was adapted from the hepatic differentiation method for human CdHs (Kim et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nPrewarm the reprogramming medium and water bath set to 37°C. Prepare a collagen-coated plate, aspirate the collagen solution, wash the plate using DPBS, and add 1.5 mL of reprogramming medium (standard in 6-well plate).\nSeed the CdHs on collagen-coated plates at 1,000 cells/cm2 and incubate for 1 day in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37°C.\nAfter a 1-day incubation, change the reprogramming medium to the hepatic differentiation medium. The hepatic differentiation date begins at this point and is counted as day 0.\nChange the medium every two days.\nAfter 6 days, aspirate the culture medium and overlay the CdHs with the Matrigel mixture.",
    "Thaw the Matrigel in ice and prepare the ice-cold hepatic differentiation medium.\nDilute the Matrigel with ice-cold hepatic differentiation medium at a 1:7 ratio on ice.\nIncubate in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37°C for 2 days (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1024-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Hepatic differentiation of mouse chemically derived hepatic progenitors (mCdHs)\nMorphological changes during the hepatic differentiation of mCdHs at day 0 (A) and 8 (B). Scale bars, 100 μm.\nNote: If differentiation is successfully completed, the differentiated cells will show the binuclear and bile canaliculi structures characteristic of hepatocytes.\nNote: If you plan to conduct experiments such as measuring albumin secretion during the hepatic differentiation process, collect the conditioned medium—before changing the medium—on days 0, 2, 4, and 6. However, do not collect the medium on day 8 because it contains Matrigel.\nSampling for mRNA isolation.\nGently add the ice-cold DMEM/F-12(1 mL / 1,000 cells) to the cells and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.\nGently aspirate the Matrigel mixture using a pipette.\nCritical: Be careful not to aspirate the cells with Matrigel mixture.\nGently add the ice-cold DPBS (1 mL / 1,000 cells) to the cells and aspirate it.\nAdd 1 mL of Tryp/LE and incubate for 3 min at 37°C.\nDetach the cells from the collagen-coated plate and transfer to a 15 mL tube with 9 mL of ice-cold DMEM/F-12.\nCentrifuge at 200 g for 5 min at 4°C and aspirate the supernatant.\nNote: After centrifugation, if there is still an excessive quantity of Matrigel, add ice-cold DPBS, resuspend the pellet, and centrifuge again.\nIsolate the mRNA using TRIzol (Rio et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nSampling for immunocytochemistry\nGently add 1 mL of ice-cold DPBS to the cells and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.\nGently aspirate the Matrigel mixture using a pipette.",
    "Critical: Be careful not to aspirate the cells with Matrigel mixture. If the Matrigel mixture remains, repeat steps 14a and 14b.\nFixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, methanol, etc., according to the experimenter’s immunocytochemistry protocol.\nProceed to Immunocytochemistry.\nCholangiocytic differentiation\nTiming: 7 days\nThis step describes the differentiation of CdHs into cholangiocyte-like cells (CdH-Chols). The protocol was adapted from the cholangiocytic differentiation method for human CdHs (Kim et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nHarvest the CdHs using Tryp/LE in the same manner as the passaging method.\nResuspend the pellet with cholangiocytic differentiation medium at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate.\nCritical: Seeding with too high confluence makes it difficult for cells to form tubular-like structures.\nMix the cells with an equal volume of collagen type I (pH 7.0) on ice.\nCritical: If the mixture does not solidify, even after incubation for 30 min, the pH is not 7.0. Adjust collagen type I to pH 7.0, using NaOH or HCl, and mix with the cells.\nIncubate for 30 min at 37°C.\nGently add 1 mL of the prewarmed cholangiocytic differentiation medium.\nIncubate for 7 days in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37°C (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Change the medium every two days using fresh cholangiocytic differentiation medium.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1024-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Scale bars, 100 μm.\nNote: If the differentiation process is done well, the cells form the tubular-like structure.\nCritical: Be careful not to aspirate the cells with the collagen mixture when changing the medium.\nSampling for mRNA isolation.\nGently aspirate the cultured medium and wash with 1 mL DPBS.\nAspirate the DPBS and add TRIzol or lysis buffer depending on the mRNA isolation methods.\nSampling for immunocytochemistry",
    "Gently aspirate the cultured medium and wash with 1 mL DPBS.\nAspirate the DBPS gently.\nFixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, methanol, etc., according to the experimenter’s immunocytochemistry protocol.\nProceed to Immunocytochemistry."
