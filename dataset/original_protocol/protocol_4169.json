    "Cells and media HEK-BlueTM IFN-α/β cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 50 U/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml Normocin in a humidified incubator at 37 °C under 5% CO2. HEK-BlueTM IFN-α/β cells should not be passaged more than 20 times to remain fully efficient. HEK-BlueTM IFN-α/β cells should be maintained with two selective antibiotics, Zeocin (100 mg/ml) and Blasticidin (30 μg/ml). Do not use selective antibiotics for the test procedure. Cells should be passaged when a 70-80% confluency is reached.    Interferon detection Day 1   Add 50 µl of each sample per well of a flat-bottom 96-well plate. If infectious virus is present in the collected samples, it should be inactivated using UV cross-linker for 5 min at 1,000 μJ/cm2. The sample of the 96-well plate with standards, samples and negative controls (see next steps for the details). “Mock” indicates the same amount of media, but from uninfected cells. “Neg.c.” indicates negative control and described below.  table:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11\nIFN (1),IFN (1),IFN (1),Sample 1,Sample 1,Sample 1,,,,,,\nIFN (2),IFN (2),IFN (2),Sample 2,Sample 2,Sample 2,,,,,,\nIFN (3),IFN (3),IFN (3),Sample 3,Sample 3,Sample 3,,,,,,\nIFN (4),IFN (4),IFN (4),Sample 4,Sample 4,Sample 4,,,,,,\nIFN (5),IFN (5),IFN (5),Sample 5,Sample 5,Sample 5,,,,,,\nIFN (6),IFN (6),IFN (6),Mock,Mock,Mock,,,,,,\nIFN (7),IFN (7),IFN (7),Neg.c. 1,Neg.c. 1,Neg.c. 1,,,,,,\nIFN (8),IFN (8),IFN (8),Neg.c. 2,Neg.c. 2,Neg.c. 2,,,,,,\n          Add 50 µl of IFN-α or IFN-β dilutions (1-8).  table:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\n1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\n\"10,000 U/ml\",\"3,333 U/ml\",\"1,111 U/ml\",370 U/ml,123 U/ml,41 U/ml,13.7 U/ml,4.6 U/ml\n75 µl of 104 IU/ml,50 µl DMEM,50 µl DMEM,50 µl DMEM,50 µl DMEM,50 µl DMEM,50 µl DMEM,50 µl DMEM",
    "Transfer 25 µl to each next well to make 1:3 dilutions as demonstrated in the table above. To prepare the dilutions, use the same DMEM as for the maintenance of HEK-BlueTM IFN-α/β cells (no selective antibiotics needed for this step).   Suggested negative controls: (1) 50 µl of IFN-γ at 104 U/ml in one well, (2) 50 µl of UV-inactivated medium from virus infected IFN-α/β-negative cell line (like BHK-21) with titer of virus similar to samples used in the same experiment.   Prepare suspension of HEK-BlueTM IFN-α/β cells at ~280,000 cells per ml in test medium (DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 50 U/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml Normocin).   Add 180 µl of cell suspension (~50,000 cells) per well.   Incubate the plate at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator for 20-24 h.    Day 2   Prepare QUANTI-BlueTM reagent following the instructions on the package.   Add 180 µl of resuspended QUANTI-BlueTM reagent per well of a flat-bottom 96-well plate.   Add 50 µl of supernatant from induced HEK-BlueTM IFN-α/β cells.   Incubate the plate for 1-3 h at 37 °C in CO2 incubator.   Determine SEAP levels using a spectrophotometer (Tecan Sunrise plate reader) at 620-655 nm.   Calculations should be performed using plots drawn separately for each range of obtained values. Please note that the curve is not linear and IFN values should be within the detection range, otherwise use dilutions of initial samples. Representative curve obtained in one of the experiments is shown below. Please note that in given experimental conditions higher concentrations of IFN (1,000-10,000) reach the plateau level and dilutions of initial samples are strongly recommended:  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140510/20140510063217_9910.jpg  Note: manufacturer recommends using 20 µl of sample volume (day 1) and 20 µl of supernatant (day 2), but we found that increased volumes (50 µl) improved the reproducibility of the results."
