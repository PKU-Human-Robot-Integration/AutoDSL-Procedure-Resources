    "1. Plant Growth\nSeed sterilization (optional)\nPrepare 50% bleach in double-distilled water (ddH2O) with 1 or 2 drops of a non-ionic detergent (see Table of Materials) in a 50 mL tube. Invert the tube several times to mix the solution.\nNOTE: It is preferable to conduct seed sterilization in a laminar flow cabinet with a UV sterilized surface for 15 min.\nAdd the bleach solution to ~100–200 S. parvula seeds in a 1.5 mL tube. Mix thoroughly and let the tube sit for 5 min.\nRemove the bleach from the tube and add 70% ethanol. Wash the seeds by pipetting several times and then remove the ethanol solution immediately.\nWash the seeds in sterilized water to remove excess bleach and ethanol, then remove the water. Repeat this step 5 to 6 times.\nSeed stratification\nImmerse the seeds in sterilized water, and store for 5 to 7 days at 4 °C. Alternatively, sow dried unsterilized seeds directly on wet soil, and place the soil tray for 5 to 7 days at 4 °C.\nGrowing plants in preparation of transformation\nFill the soil mix (see Table of Materials) into 7 x 6 cm2 pots, soak the pots in water, and spray water from the top to ensure a uniformly wet growth medium. Add 5– fertilizer beads (see Table of Materials) on the soil surface of each pot.\nNOTE: As far as we have experienced, S. parvula grows well on any soil mix where A. thaliana can grow.\nUsing a wet toothpick, transfer 20~25 seeds per pot on the soil surface.\nNOTE: A convenient practice is to put a batch of 4–5 seeds in the four corners and the center of the pot (Figure 1, Day 15, left panel).",
    "Cover the pot tray with a clear dome to keep the seeds under high humidity during germination.\nKeep the plant trays in a growth chamber with a light intensity set at 130 µmol m−2 s−1 light, 22–24 °C temperature, and 14 h per day/10 h per night cycle. Remove the domes after 7 - 10 days following germination. Add water from the bottom of the tray to keep soil moistened uniformly at a desirable level.\nWeed out extra seedlings and leave only 4–5 healthy seedlings per pot well separated from each other (Figure 1, Day 15, right panel).\nGently water the plants every two days and fertilize with 0.2x Hoagland's solution16 once every two weeks.\nNOTE: Keeping the soil moisture at a uniform level is key to growing S. parvula consistently and healthily.\nContinue to grow the plants for 8–10 weeks until multiple inflorescences produce 100–150 floral buds per plant (Figure 1, Day 60–80). On the day planned for the floral-dip based transformation (step 4.5), remove all mature and developing siliques from the plants.\n2. Cloning the Gene/Genomic Element of Interest into a Vector for Plant Transformation\nAmplify the target DNA fragment using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)17 and isolate the PCR product using a gel extraction kit (see Table of Materials) according to the kit protocol or any other appropriate method to purify DNA using agarose gel electrophoresis17,18. Verify the sequence of the isolated PCR product through Sanger sequencing19.\nClone the desired PCR product into the cloning vector and transform the cloned construct into the competent E. coli cells using a topoisomerase-based cloning kit (see Table of Materials) following manufacturer's guidelines.",
    "Spread 50 µL of transformed products on Luria-Bertani20 (LB) agar bacterial growth media (Table 1) with appropriate antibiotics, e.g., 50 µg/ mL Spectinomycin (see Table of Materials), and incubate at 37 °C overnight.\nThe following day, select 5–10 single colonies, inoculate into liquid LB medium with appropriate antibiotics, and incubate with gentle shaking at 37 °C overnight.\nIsolate plasmids using a plasmid isolation kit (see Table of Materials) and verify through Sanger sequencing19 whether the target sequence amplified in 2.1 is properly cloned.\nTransfer the cloned and verified PCR product to a destination vector for plant transformation compatible with recombination-based cloning (see Table of Materials), using a recombinase enzyme mix kit (see Table of Materials), following the kit manufacturer's instruction. Repeat from step 2.3 to step 2.5 to isolate and verify clones harboring proper plasmid constructs.\n3. Transforming the Vector Construct for Plant Transformation into Agrobacterium tumefaciens\nTransform the plasmid of the vector construct from 2.6 into the A. tumefaciens strain GV3101:pMP90RK21, which harbors a Rifampicin resistance gene for chromosomal background selection. Use appropriate antibiotics, e.g. Gentamycin or Kanamycin (see Table of Materials), for the selection of plant transformation construct (Ti plasmid). A brief protocol for A. tumefaciens transformation via electroporation is included in section 3.2.\nA. tumefaciens transformation by electroporation\nThaw the A. tumefaciens competent cells22 on ice. Mix 0.1–1 µg of the plasmid prepared from 2.6, dissolved in 1–2 µL of ddH2O, with competent cells on ice. Transfer the mixture into an electroporation cuvette (see Table of Materials).\nPerform electroporation on the mixture of plasmids and competent cells from 3.2.1, using an electroporator (see Table of Materials) following the manufacturer's guidelines.\nNOTE: Clean the surface of the cuvette before starting the electroporation.",
    "Transfer the reaction mixture from the cuvette to a microcentrifuge tube that contains 1.5 mL of liquid LB and mix well with pipetting and incubate for 1 h at 28 °C with gentle shaking.\nInoculate the transformed A. tumefaciens from section 3.2 on LB plates containing appropriate selection antibiotics (e.g. Kanamycin 25 µg/ mL, Spectinomycin 50 µg/ mL, Gentamycin 25 µg/ mL, and Rifampicin 50 µg/ mL) and incubate at 28 °C for 3 days.\n4. Agrobacterium-mediated Transformation of S. parvula\nInoculate the single transformed colonies from plates into 10 mL of LB liquid media containing antibiotics (the same as in 3.3) in a sterile 50 mL conical tube (see Table of Materials). Incubate for 24 h in a shaking incubator (see Table of Materials) at 250 r.p.m. at 28 °C.\nTransfer the bacterial solution from 3.4.1 to a sterile 250 mL flask, add 40 mL of LB liquid media with appropriate antibiotics, and incubate 12 h until the optical density at 600 nm wavelength (OD600) reaches around 2.0.\nCentrifuge the A. tumefaciens cultureat 3,100 x g for 10 min. Remove the supernatant and re-suspend the bacterial culture in 40 mL of A. tumefaciens infiltration solution (Table 1).\nDilute the resuspended A. tumefaciens with infiltration solution to a final OD600 of 0.8. Add 25 µL of surfactant solution (Table 1) to 50 mL of diluted A. tumefaciens solution and mix by inverting several times.\nDip the inflorescence of the plants in the A. tumefaciens solution prepared in the section 4.4 for 20 s. Use a fresh bacterial solution after dipping inflorescence from six pots. Make sure all flowers are in contact with the solution. Pipet bacterial solutions directly onto flowers located in the lower part of the inflorescence if they cannot be dipped into the solution.",
    "NOTE: For the first-round transformation, make sure to remove all mature and developing siliques using a sharp scalpel or small scissors. Do not remove siliques if performing transformation for the second time.\n5. Post-transformation Plant Care and the Second Transformation\nPlace the floral-dipped plants horizontally in clean trays with domes to cover the plants and place in a dark growth room for 1–2 days.\nNOTE: Keeping the flowers under high-humidity is important at this stage (Figure 1, Plants after transformation).\nReturn the plants to an upright position and transfer the plants to a growth room with a 14 h per day/10 h per night cycle, 130 µmol m-2 s-1 light intensity and 22 to 24 °C temperature.\nMonitor the dipped inflorescences in the following week. If a significant number of flowers abort (Figure 2), repeat the floral dip (step 4) after about 4 weeks or after a large number of flowers have newly developed.\nNOTE: Unlike the preparation step for the first transformation (step 1.3.7), do not remove pre-existing or developing siliques (Figure 2) before the second round of transformation.\nGrow the plants until seeds mature and harvest seeds at ~21 weeks.\nDry seeds for 2–3 weeks at room temperature in an airtight container with filled with desiccants (see Table of Materials).\n6. Selection of Positive Transformants\nPlant the T1 seeds as described for wild type seeds in steps 1.2 to 1.3.\nGrow the plants until the first 2 true leaves develop, approximately 10–14 days after germination.\nPerform the first selection for herbicide resistance (Figure 3A and 3B) as detailed below.\nDilute the glufosinate-ammonium (11.3%) herbicide (or BASTA) (Table 1) to 1:1,000 (v/v). Spray diluted BASTA solution on the seedlings and cover the plants with domes overnight.\nRepeat BASTA spraying 2–3 times every 5–7 days.",
    "Perform the second selection using a BASTA-drop test as detailed below.\nIdentify plants that survive after being sprayed 3–4 times with BASTA solution. Grow the plants for another 2–3 weeks until 3–5 leaves develop a relatively large surface area.\nSelect the largest mature leaf per plant, rub the surface of the leaf gently with a finger to remove the wax layer, and place a drop of the diluted BASTA solution (from step 6.3.1).\nNOTE: Mark the location of the leaf applied with the BASTA drop by placing a paper tape on the nearest stem.\nMonitor the leaves applied with the BASTA drop for signs of wilting for up to one week. Select the plants with leaves unaffected by the BASTA drops.\nNOTE: Leaves from most false-positive plants start to wilt within two days, while leaves from true-positives are intact even after the drop of BASTA solution dries up (Figure 3C).\nConfirm positive transformants using genomic PCR.\nCollect 2–3 leaves from the surviving plants at step 6.4.5.\nExtract genomic DNA from the leaves using the CTAB method23 or any other appropriate DNA extraction method.\nPerform PCR using extracted genomic DNA samples from target plants, wild-type plants (as negative controls), and the plasmid construct from the step 3.1 (as a positive control). Use an appropriate pair of PCR primers specific to the selective marker gene, e.g., for BASTA-resistant gene (bar), TCAGCAGGTGGGTGTAGA (forward) and GTCAACCACTACATCGAGACAA (reverse).\n\t\t\nFor the example PCR primers targeting the bar gene, use the following PCR conditions: the initial denaturation step at 98 °C for 30 s; followed by 30 cycles of denaturing at 98 °C for 30 s, annealing at 59 °C for 30 s, and extending at 72 °C for 30 s; and the final extension at 72 °C for 5 min.",
    "NOTE: To ensure the insertion of the entire T-DNA, we recommend also performing genomic PCR using a PCR primer from the selective marker gene and another PCR primer specific to the target sequence cloned to the plant transformation vector at the step\nConfirm the presence of the expected size of the amplified bar PCR product by agarose gel electrophoresis17 for the target samples (Figure 4A) as well as by sequencing the isolated PCR product19 using the same procedure as in step 2.1.\nSubscription Required.
