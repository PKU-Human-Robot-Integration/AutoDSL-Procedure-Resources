    "All experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Experimental Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center, Suita, Japan.\n1. Prepare the following animals and materials for MIUH surgery\nPrepare timed pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats at gestational day 17, i.e., embryonic day 17 (E17). The dams' average body weights are 307.0 ± 40.7 g (mean ± SD, n = 9).\nPrepare metal microcoils; inner diameter 0.24 mm, made from gold-coated steel.\nPrepare all the materials as per the Table of Materials.\n2. Prepare for MIUH surgery\nWarm a heating pad at 37 °C for rat placement\nPlace a sterile diaper on the heating pad\nWarm sterile saline at 37 °C in a water bath\n3. Perform MIUH surgery\nPerform surgical procedures under sterile condition. Sterilize coils, forceps, needle with 70% ethanol before use. Use sterile gloves, and occasionally disinfect by applying ethanol spray.\nPlace the rat in the anesthesia induction box. Introduce 4% isoflurane into the box (approximately 5 min).\nPlace the rat onto a sterile diaper on the heating pad in a supine position after the animal is thoroughly anesthetized in the induction box. Check for depth of anesthesia by the lack of a response to a toe pinch. Maintain 1.5-2.0% isoflurane with a nose cone.\nApply depilatory foam onto the abdomen from the navel down to the region of the pelvic arch. After several minutes, wipe off the depilatory foam with a paper towel. A shaver may be used as a substitute for the depilatory foam.\nApply gauze soaked in iodine disinfectant solution to the depilated region of the skin.",
    "Place a surgical drape with a round opening to cover the abdomen other than the area of the surgical incision. Several pieces of gauze may be used as a substitute for the drape.\nUsing a surgical scalpel, make an incision approximately 2.5 cm long on the lower abdomen from the upper edge of the pubic bone straight up toward the navel. Then, make an incision through the muscle layer underneath.\nPlace several pieces of sterile gauze around the opening of the drape, and wet the gauze with warmed saline.\nPush both lateral sides of the abdomen gently, so that a portion of uterine horn emerges from the incision.\nDisinfect the surgeon's hands with 70% ethanol.\nGently pull the entire uterine horn from the abdominal cavity manually without using forceps. Using surgical forceps is not advisable, as they may easily damage the fragile uterus, fetuses, and blood vessels by compressing them strongly and unevenly.\nPlace the uterine horn on the wet gauze.\nPerform the same procedure for the other uterine horn.\nCount the number of fetuses.\nApply warmed saline frequently to keep the uterus warm and wet throughout the surgery.\n\t\nChange the diaper when it has absorbed too much saline. To maintain stability, repeat disinfection gloves with 70% ethanol and tips of the instrument with iodine. Keeping the non-sterile fingers away from the sterile tips of the instrument is crucial.\nIdentify the proximal part of the main arcade of the ovarian and uterine arteries under a stereomicroscope.",
    "NOTE: It is crucial to distinguish the main arcade from the branches to the placentas. Note that the surgical operation may be easier when the uterine horn is flipped. Occasionally, applying a coil at the very proximal part of the arcade is difficult, because it is located deep within the abdominal cavity and arteries to the placenta are very close to the proximal part of the arcade. In this case, a coil can be applied to a part of the arcade after the first branch forks off.\nSeparate the artery from the vein running parallel to it with forceps and make space between them.\nPlace a piece of string (silk suture 4.0, 5 cm long) underneath the artery.\nLift up both ends of the string with forceps so that the artery is lifted and separated from the fragile vein.\nHolding the edge of the microcoil with fine forceps in the other hand, place a microcoil beside the lifted artery (Figure 2.1).\nRotate the lifted artery by using the string around the microcoil to wrap the microcoil around the artery. It is easier to rotate the artery around the coil than to rotate the coil around the artery (Figure 2.2).\nAfter rotating the artery 3 or 4 turns (coils have 5 turns), change the site at which the coil is held to the other edge. Hold the edge of the coil that has been wrapped around the artery with forceps. Change the site at which the string lifts the artery to the other side of coil. Rotate the artery around the coil so that the coil completely (5 turns) wraps the artery (Figure 2.3, 2.4).\nRemove the string.\nPerform the same procedure for the other three arteries.",
    "Note that frequently applying warmed saline to the uterus is crucial; otherwise, the mortality rate of the fetuses increases, and hypothermia might be neuroprotective.\nGently return the uterine horn into the abdominal cavity. Lifting an edge of the abdominal wall incision with forceps can make this procedure easier.\nStich the abdominal muscle, and then stich the abdominal skin with suture (silk suture 4.0). Tie the suture after each stich, i.e. interrupted single sutures.\nApply gauze soaked in iodine disinfectant solution on and around the surgical incision.\nAdminister the analgesic meloxicam at 0.5 mg/kg body weight subcutaneously.\nAllow for 30 min of recovery in a warmed cage. Check animals if fully awake and moving around the cage, return to home cage.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
