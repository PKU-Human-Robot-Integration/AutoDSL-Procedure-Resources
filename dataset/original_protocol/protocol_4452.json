    "Preparation of a liver single cell suspension    Sacrifice the mouse using CO2 and restrain it by pinning its paws into a foam surface using syringe needles. Of note, all murine experiments were performed according to the ECPVA guidelines (CETS n° 123) and were approved by the VUB Ethical Committee (Permit Number: 08-220-8). Heparinized blood was taken via cardiac puncture (~1 ml) in order to prevent too much blood contamination when taking the liver. Alternatively, the liver can be perfused in vivo via the portal vein with 10 ml saline. Make a parallel incision from the base of the tail up to the neck along the mouse’s abdomen and to the paws without puncturing the peritoneum. Gently pull back the skin and pin it to the foam surface. Subsequently, open the mouse abdomen and softly move the intestines on the side to get access to the liver using a cotton plug.    Gently take out the liver from the body, without damaging it.   Store the harvested liver in 5 ml RPMI medium in a 50 ml Falcon tube on ice until the digestion procedure.   Put the liver in a GentleMACSTM C-tube and add 5 ml liver digestion medium. Subsequently, cut the liver in small pieces (1-1.5 mm) using scissors (Figure 1A/B).    Homogenize the liver using the GentleMACSTM Dissociator (Figure 1C) using 2 times program mLiver_01_03 (16 sec) at room temperature. Subsequently, incubate at 37 °C for 20-30 min while shaking in a water bath to allow digestion of the tissue.   Homogenize the liver suspension once more using the GentleMACSTM Dissociator program mLiver_02_03 (25 sec) at room temperature (Figure 1D). Finally, add 5 ml of blocking medium to stop the liver digestion.    In order to measure the cytokine content within whole liver, collect 0.5 ml of the solution in a 1.",
    "5 ml Eppendorf tube and centrifuge it at 10,625 x g for 8 min at room temperature. Subsequently, collect the supernatant and store at -20 °C till needed.    Filter the remaining liver suspension through a 70-µm sterile nylon gauze into a sterile 50 ml conical tube. Wash the GentleMACSTM C-tube with an additional 20 ml of blocking solution and rinse the filter once more with this.    Centrifuge the 50 ml tubes at 450 x g for 8 min at 4 °C and gently discard the supernatant.   Eliminate the red blood cells by resuspending the cell pellet in 5 ml ice-cold erythrocyte lysis buffer and leaving it on ice for 2-3 min.    Neutralize the lysis by adding 25 ml cell suspension medium, and transfer the suspension to a new 50 ml tube through a 70-µm sterile nylon gauze.    Centrifuge the 50 ml tube at 450 x g for 8 min at 4 °C and gently discard the supernatant.   Resuspend the cell pellet in 5 ml cell suspension medium and count the living cells using Trypan blue.  At this stage, the suspension contains both parenchymal (hepatocytes) and non-parenchymal (including polymorphonuclear cells, monocytes, macrophages, DCs, NK and NKT cells) liver cells. Although this suspension can be analyzed via flow-cytometry, it is advisable to perform additional fractionation steps to allow cell culturing and/or FACS sorting.      Fractionation of liver cells using a Lymphoprep gradient separation   Add slowly 10 ml LymphoprepTM (Lucron Bioproducts) underneath the resuspended liver cell solution using a 10 ml syringe with long needle. Centrifuge at 800 x g for 25 min at 20 °C without acceleration or brake (Figure 1E).   Carefully collect the layer of low-density cells at the interphase containing the non-parenchymal liver cells (enriched in mononuclear myeloid cells as well as T-, B- and NK/NKT-cells).",
    "If the interphase is not clearly visible (low amount of cells) you can also collect the upper phase (containing RPMI medium). Take as less as possible of the lower phase containing Lymphoprep (Figure 1E).    Transfer the interphase to a new sterile 15 ml tube and fill to the top with MACS buffer. Centrifuge at 800 x g for 7 min at 20 °C and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the cell pellet in 1-2 ml cell suspension medium, and after counting the cells using Trypan blue, bring at a concentration of 107 cells/ml.   After removal of the Lymphoprep, collect the lower fraction (pellet) containing mainly parenchymal cells (hepatocytes) and polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells that were not retained within the non-parenchymal cell fraction due to their high density characteristics and transfer it to a sterile 15 ml Falcon tube (Figure 1E). Resuspend the cells in a final volume of 15 ml cell suspension medium and centrifuge at 650 x g for 8 min at 20 °C.   Subsequently, in order to remove the Lymphoprep solution perform 1-2 washing steps of 15 ml cell suspension medium. Finally, resuspend the pellet in 3 ml cell suspension medium and, after counting the cells using Trypan blue, bring at a concentration of 107 cells/ml.  The interphase (non-parenchymal cells) fraction can now be used for FACS analysis/sorting as well as for cell culturing conditions. The bottom fraction containing hepatocytes and remaining non-parenchymal cells (PMN as well as macrophages with higher density) can also be used for flow-cytometric analysis. The latter fraction can be further cleaned-up using a Percoll gradient in order to separate hepatocytes from the remaining non-parenchymal cells. Of note, if hepatocytes are not needed DNase 1 can be added to the digestion medium, resulting in a cleaner sample.",
    "Fractionation of liver cells using a Percoll gradient separation   To separate hepatocytes from the PMN and remaining macrophages, mix 1 vol. (~ 5 ml of the 107/ml working solution) of cell suspension with 1 vol. of isotonic Percoll solution of density 1.07 g/ml (33% working solution). Centrifuge for 30 min at 800 x g at room temperature (Figure 1F). Aspirate hepatocytes, forming a broad band at a density of 1.07-1.09 g/ml, from the gradient and wash free of Percoll by two additional cycles of centrifugation at 800 x g, for 5 min and resuspension in 3 ml cell suspension medium.   After removal of the Percoll, collect the lower cell pellet fraction containing mainly PMN and macrophages that were not retained within the non-parenchymal fraction due to their density characteristics and transfer it to a sterile 15 ml Falcon tube.   Subsequently, centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 min. at 4 °C, resuspend the pellet in 1 ml cell suspension medium, count the cells using Trypan blue and bring them at a concentration of 107 cells/ml.  The different fractions obtained in sections B and C can be used for flow-cytometric analysis or when resuspended in complete medium for in vitro cell culturing.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150519/20150519185431_3454.jpg Figure 1.

    "Optional: Percoll gradient after centrifugation with a clearly visible upper fraction (hepatocytes, blue arrow) and a pellet (PMN and remaining non-parenchymal cells with higher density).      Flow-cytometric analysis   Transfer 100 µl of a 107 cells/ml stock solution of the different fractions [(interface Lymphoprep (section B), pellet Percoll (section C)] into a 5 ml polypropylene round-bottom tube to prevent sticking of cells. Incubate the cell suspension with 1 µg rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32 FcR-blocking antibody clone (2.4 G2, 1 µg per 106 cells) on ice water for 20 min.    Subsequently, add fluorescently labeled antibodies (0.2 µg per 106 cells) for another 20 min on ice water, protected from exposure to light. Antibodies used are FITC-conjugated Ly6G, PE-conjugated F4/80, APC-conjugated Ly6C, APC-Cy7 conjugated CD45, PE-Cy7-conjugated anti-CD11b and PerCP-Cy5.5-conjugated MHC-II.   Wash by adding 2 ml ice-cold MACS buffer, centrifuge at 450 x g for 6 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatant. Add 100-200 µl cell suspension medium to keep cells alive, transfer the cells into a FACS tube and proceed to the FACSCantoTM.   Analyze the FACS data using FlowJo software. Briefly, after selecting a life gate and single cells (using a FSC-A versus FSC-H profile) select the CD45+ cells in a CD45 versus FSC-A plot (Figure 2, upper and lower panels). Within the CD45+ cells, gate out the PMN based on their CD11bpos Ly6Gpos expression profile and select for the CD11bpos Ly6Gneg expressing cells (Figure 3A). The CD11bneg Ly6Gneg population consists mainly of T-cells, B-cells and NK-cells. Next, plot the CD11bpos Ly6Gneg cells in a Ly6C versus MHC-II plot and subsequently check for F4/80 expression. As such, monocytes as Ly6Chigh MHC-IIneg F4/80low cells, monocyte-derived “immature” macrophages as Ly6Chigh MHC-IIhigh F4/80high cells, resident/mature macrophages (i.e.",
    "Kupffer cells/”mature” monocyte-derived macrophage) as Ly6Cneg/low MHC-IIhigh F4/80high cells, patrolling monocytes as Ly6Cneg/low MHC-IIneg F4/80low cells and eosinophils based on their Ly6Cint MHC-IIneg F4/80low expression are identified (Figure 3B). Of note, the identity of eosinophils is confirmed based on their SiglecF expression and high SSC.   imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150519/20150519185508_7075.jpg Figure 2.
