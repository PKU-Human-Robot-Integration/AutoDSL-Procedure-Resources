    "Cell cultureStreak A. baumannii ATCC 17978 onto LB agar plates from frozen glycerol stocks and incubate at 37°C overnight.Use single colonies to inoculate 3 ml LB broth and shake at 37°C overnight.Note: The experiment should be performed in biological triplicate and A. baumannii is grown at a liquid-to-air ratio of 1:5, e.g., 10 ml LB in a 50-ml centrifuge tube. Dilute the overnight cultures 1:50 in 10 ml LB and grow for approximately 1 h until OD600 = 0.1, at which time the culture should be diluted 1:100 into sterilized flasks containing 250 ml LB and shaken at 37°C until OD600 = 0.2.Note: Six samples will be collected in total; a biological triplicate of wild-type (WT) untreated and a biological triplicate of WT treated with Na2S. The volume of culture required depends on the organism of choice and how much protein is needed for the workflow. Typically, 2 mg total protein is required for each replicate but more may be necessary depending on the sensitivity of the MS instrument used. Add Na2S to three of the six cultures at a final concentration of 0.2 mM and incubate for an additional 30 min at 37°C. Then proceed with the following steps.Centrifuge all cultures at 4,226 × g for 15 min at 4°C, discard the supernatant, and place the pellets on ice.Note: Untreated cultures should be centrifuged when OD600 = 0.2 and Na2S-treated cultures should be centrifuged 30 min post-addition of Na2S. Wash cell pellets with 5 ml cold PBS, centrifuge at 4,226 × g for 15 min at 4°C, and discard the supernatant.Wash the cell pellets with 1 ml cold PBS, transfer to 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes, centrifuge at 19,090 × g for 3 min, and discard the supernatant.",
    "Note: Cell pellets can be stored at -80°C until ready to proceed to lysis. Cell LysisNote: Step B1 should utilize buffer that has been degassed, purged with argon, and stored in an anaerobic chamber. If an anaerobic chamber is not available, prepare fresh buffer each time and degas the buffer thoroughly and purge with argon. Steps B3 and B5 are performed in an anaerobic chamber. The aliquot used in Step B4 can be removed from the chamber to complete the assay. Resuspend the pellets in 1 ml Lysis Buffer (see Recipes) and freeze/thaw 5 times in liquid nitrogen and a 37°C water bath.Note: Lysis buffer can be modified, e.g., detergent, salt, pH, etc. It is important to make sure that the buffer is degassed and purged with argon (preferably stored in an anaerobic chamber) to minimize exposure to oxygen during Steps B1-B2, which take approximately 1 h. Transfer the lysate to Matrix B lysing tubes and shake on a homogenizer for 45 s (5 s on, 90 s off intervals) at 6.8 m/s and 4°C.Transfer the samples to an anaerobic chamber (<1 ppm O2) and centrifuge using a standard microcentrifuge for 15 min at 4°C. Transfer the supernatant to a clean 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube, centrifuge again, and transfer to a clean tube to ensure that no cellular debris is present.Remove 2-10 μl supernatant and perform a standard Bradford assay to determine the protein concentration using bovine serum albumin as a protein standard.Based on the Bradford assay, aliquot a volume of lysate that corresponds to 6 mg protein for each replicate. The remaining lysate can be flash frozen and stored at -80°C until whole proteome analysis (Procedure E).Alkylation and tryptic digestionNote: Steps C1-C3 should be performed in an anaerobic chamber.",
    "If one is not available, use buffer prepared according to the note in Procedure B and minimize sample exposure to oxygen. Alternative buffer exchange protocols may be substituted to reduce time. Buffer exchange the samples from Step B5 in the anaerobic chamber using a 3 kDa cut-off concentrator by repeated cycles of the addition of 8 M urea in 100 mM ABC followed by centrifugation at 4°C for 10 min. Repeat this process 7-8 times. When complete, transfer the sample to a clean 1.5-ml tube, by inverting the concentrator, and centrifuge for 30 s.Optional: 8 M urea in 100 mM ABC can be added to increase the sample volume (no more than 500 µl total is recommended).Note: Other methods of buffer exchange may be used. Add 2 mg BIAM at room temperature protected from light and incubate for 90 min.Buffer exchange the samples as described previously (Step C1) using 100 mM ABC, until the concentration of urea is approximately 1 M (or less), and transfer to a clean tube.Optional: Additional buffer may be added to increase the sample volume (no more than 500 µl is recommended).Remove the samples from the anaerobic chamber, add 60 µg trypsin, and check that the pH of the samples is basic by adding 1 μl sample to pH indicator paper; add an additional 100 mM ABC buffer to adjust the pH if needed. Incubate the samples in a 37°C water bath for 18 h.Desalt the peptides and remove undigested proteins by running the C18 Sep-Pak protocol.Sample PreparationAcidify the samples using 10% solutions of trifluoroacetic acid or formic acid to a final concentration of 0.2% and check that the pH is acidic using pH indicator paper; if not acidic, add more acid.",
    "Pellet the insoluble material using a microcentrifuge operating at 16,363 × g for 15 min at 4°C and transfer the supernatant to a clean 1.5-ml tube.Sep-Pak PreparationUsing a clean razor blade, trim the long end of the Sep-Pak down to the cartridge.Trim the short side half-way down; this short side is where the syringe will be attached.Condition the Sep-Pak by passing 20 ml organic buffer (see Recipes) followed by 20 ml aqueous buffer (see Recipes) using a 20-ml syringe.Note: Ensure that air is not pulled or pushed through the cartridge here or at any subsequent step. Apply the sample using a 3-ml syringe, rinse the sample tube with 1 ml aqueous buffer, and apply to cartridge.Wash the cartridge with 30 ml aqueous buffer.Elute the peptides from the cartridge using 1.6 ml organic buffer.Dry the samples in a SpeedVac concentrator and resuspend in 500 μl 100 mM ABC.Streptavidin enrichment and elution of persulfide-containing peptidesCentrifuge 1 ml avidin acrylamide resin at 845 × g for 1 min. Discard the supernatant.Note: Resin is in 50% buffer, so 2 ml is required to achieve 1 ml total resin. Determine the volume of resin required for the amount (in mg) of protein used for each sample, according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Equilibrate the resin three times by resuspending in 1 ml 100 mM ABC, centrifuging at 845 × g for 1 min, and removing the supernatant.Add the resuspended peptides (Step C5 above) to the resin and incubate at room temperature for 1 h on a rotor.Wash the resin with 75 ml 2 M NaCl in 100 mM ABC, warmed in a 37°C water bath, using a vacuum manifold.Wash the resin with 15 ml 100 mM ABC warmed in a 37°C water bath.",
    "Resuspend the resin in 1 ml 100 mM ABC, transfer to a clean 1.5-ml tube, and add TCEP to a final concentration of 20 mM. Incubate at 37°C on a rotor for 1 h. Centrifuge at 845 × g for 1 min and transfer the supernatant to a clean tube.Repeat Step D6 and combine the supernatants as the eluent.Add 37 mg IAM to the 2 ml combined eluent from Steps D6-D7 above and incubate at room temperature protected from light for 45 min.Use a C18 Omix tip to concentrate and desalt the peptides using a standard protocol and analyze by LC-MS/MS (Procedure F).Whole proteome analysis for data normalizationDry 25-μg portions of protein from lysates (Procedure B) in a SpeedVac concentrator.Resuspend proteins in 100 μl 8 M urea in 100 mM ABC containing 50 mM IAM and 5 mM TCEP and incubate at room temperature in the dark for 45 min.Precipitate proteins by adding 25 μl 100% TCA (20% (v:v)) and place the samples at -20°C for 1 h. Subsequently, centrifuge the samples at 19,090 × g for 20 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.Wash the pellets with 500 μl cold acetone and centrifuge again at 19,090 × g for 20 min at 4°C.Dry the samples in a SpeedVac concentrator, resuspend in 10 μl 8 M urea in 100 mM ABC, dilute to 1 M urea with 100 mM ABC, and digest overnight at 37°C by adding a 1:100 (w/w) ratio of trypsin.Desalt the peptides with a C18 Omix Tip using a standard protocol and analyze by LC-MS/MS (Procedure F).Mass spectrometryInject 1 μg peptides in 0.1% formic acid into the HPLC system and load onto a Symmetry C18 trapping column (180 μm × 20 mm, 5 μm).",
    "Elute the peptides using a nanoACQUITY HPLC HHS T3 analytical column (75 μm × 150 mm, 1.8 μm) with an acetonitrile-based gradient (Solvent A: 0% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid; Solvent B: 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 400 nl/min. Use a 90-min gradient as follows: 0-0.5 min, 0-14% B; 0.5-72 min, 14-50% B; 72-74 min, 50-100% B; 74-77 min, 100% B; 77-78 min, 100-0% B; 78-90 min, isocratic flow at 0% B.Carry out the electrospray ionization with a nanoESI source at a capillary temperature of 260°C and a spray voltage of 1.8 kV.Operate the Orbitrap Fusion instrument in data-dependent acquisition mode with a mass range of 350-2,000 m/z. Select the precursor ions for tandem mass (MS/MS) analysis in Orbitrap, with a 3-s cycle time using HCD at 35% collision energy. Set the intensity threshold at 5e3 and the dynamic exclusion with a repeat count of 1 and an exclusion duration of 30 s.Search the resulting data against the A. baumannii ATCC 17978 database (UniProt UP000094982, 3,780 entries) in Proteome Discoverer 2.1. Allow trypsin digestion specificity with two missed cleavages. Set the mass tolerance for precursor and fragment ions to 10 ppm and 0.6 Da, respectively. Set the carbamidomethylation (CAM) of cysteine residues as a fixed modification.
