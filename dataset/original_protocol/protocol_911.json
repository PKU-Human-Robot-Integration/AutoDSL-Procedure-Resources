    "**Antibody preparation** \nTo be done overnight the day before, or minimum one hour before protocol start.\n1. Resuspend the Dynabeads® in the vial \\(i.e. vortex for >30 seconds, or tilt and rotate for 5 minutes).\n  2. Transfer 50 µL/brain of Dynabeads® to an Eppendorf tube.\n  3. Add 1 ml of PBS with 1% BSA and 2 mM EDTA \\(referred to as 'washing medium' from now on), and resuspend.\n  4. Place the tube in the DynaMag™-2 Magnet \\(henceforth referred to as 'magnet') for 1 minute and discard the supernatant.\n  5. Remove the tube from the magnet and resuspend the washed Dynabeads® in the  same volume of washing medium as the initial volume of Dynabeads® \\(50 µL per brain).\n  6. Add 10 μL of 0,5 mg/µl CD31 antibodies per brain.\n  7. Incubate overnight at 4°C or 1 hour at RT with gentle tilting and rotation. For total volumes below 150 µl, use a 200 µl PCR tube instead of a 1,5 ml Eppendorf.\n  8. Place the tube in a magnet for 1 min and discard the supernatant.\n  9. Remove the tube from the magnet and add 1 ml washing medium. \n  10. Place the tube in the magnet for 1 min, discard the supernatant, remove the tube from the magnet and resuspend the Dynabeads® in 50 µL washing medium per brain. Use this suspension in step 13 of the next paragraph\n  \n**Isolation**\n 1. Preparation. Weigh two aliquots of 3 mg of collagenase type 2 powder. Keep at -20°C until ready to be used in step 4 and step 23. Note the different volumes of resuspending between the steps.\n2. Kill the mouse using an approved method of euthanasia \\(terminal anesthesia followed by heart perfusion with HBSS, or cervical dislocation). Remove the brain from the skull.",
    "3. Transfer the brain to a Petri dish and chop it with sharp scissors for about 30 seconds, or until no large pieces are visible. The pieces should be small enough to pass through a cut pipette tip \\(see next step).\n  4. Dissolve 3 mg of collagenase powder in 3 ml of DMEM\n  5. Transfer the brain pieces to a 5 ml tube and mix them with the collagenase solution. Use a p1000 with cut tip and wash the petri dish.\n  6. Mix the suspension well using the cut p1000 tip. The solution has to pass the tip freely with no blockage\n  7. Incubate the suspension for 5 minutes at 37 °C with rotation \\(15 rotation per minute)\n  8. Pass the suspension 10 times through an uncut p1000 tip. The solution has to pass the tip smoothly. \n  9. Incubate the suspension for 5 minutes at 37 °C with same rotation\n  10. Wash the tissue suspension with 12 ml of DMEM \\(room temperature). \n  11. Centrifuge the solution at room temperature, 5 minutes at 300g\n  12. Resuspend the pellet in 4,5 ml of DMEM, and divide the solution in 3 Eppendorf tubes of 2 ml \\(i.e. approximately 1,7 ml per tube)\n  13. Add 15 µL of the antibody+beads solution in each eppendorf \\(50 µL/brain). Pipet up and down several times to homogenize before using.\n  14. Incubate at room temperature for 30 min with gentle rotation\n  15. Place the three aliquots on the magnet and wait 2,5 minutes\n  16. Remove the supernatant\n  17. Add 2 ml of DMEM to the beads, remove the tubes from the magnet and resuspend the beads by gently tilting the tubes end-over-end until the beads are resuspended.\n  18. Repeat step 15-17\n  19. Place the tubes on the magnet and wait 2,5 minutes. Remove the supernatant",
    "20. Pool the 3 tubes by resuspending the first pellet in 1,5 ml of DMEM, and use this resuspension to resuspend the pellets of the second and third aliquot.\n  21. Take 30 µl from the suspension and place a drop on a p100 Petri dish. Verify the presence of microvascular fragments on an inverted microscope with suitable excitation and filters for GFP. If successful, Pdgfra-H2BGFP positive nuclei will be visible at this stage, still attached to larger vascular fragments. See Figure 1 for an example\n  \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/6203/original/Figure_1_MV_isolation_pdgfralpha_cells.png?1512515962\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n22. Place the tubes on the magnet and wait 2,5 minutes. Remove the supernatant\n  23. Resuspend the beads in 1 ml of Collagenase single cell digestion buffer \\(3 mg/ml of collagenase type 2 in DMEM) and incubated for 5 minutes at 37 °C with rotation\n  24. Using a 1ml syringe, pass the suspension firmly, but without creating bubbles or foam, through a 20 G needle for 10 times.\n  25. Incubate the single cell suspension for 5 minutes at 37 °C\n  26. Remove the beads by placing the suspension on the magnet for 2,5 minutes. Remove the supernatant containing the cells.\n  27. Centrifuge the cells at 300g for 5 minutes at 4 °C\n  28. Resuspend the cell pellet in 500 µl of FACS buffer. Proceed with FACS"
