    "1. Preparation of the plant material and growth conditions\nTo generate the needed plant material, sterilize the seeds of Arabidopsis wild type and mutant lines of interest.\n\tNOTE: In this protocol, we used the following: ttl1: T-DNA insertion lines Salk_063943 (for TTL1; AT1G53300) - Columbia-0 (Col-0) wild-type; the Procuste1 (prc1-1) mutant, which consists of a knock-out mutation (Q720stop) in the CESA6 gene (AT5G64740), as previously described in10,11; and ttl1 x prc1-1 double mutant.\n\t\nPut an approximate volume of 50 μL of seeds in a microtube. Add 500 μL of 70% ethanol + 0.01% Tween solution at room temperature. Mix and incubate for 7 min.\nPour the ethanol solution and add 500 μL of 20% sodium hypochlorite. Mix and incubate for 7 min.\nPour the sodium hypochlorite solution and wash the seeds three to four times with sterile water.\nPlating\n\t\nPrepare in advance basal Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium12 + 1.5% sucrose + 1% agar (pH 5.7) (see Table of Materials). Autoclave the medium. Prepare a laminar flow hood to work in a sterile environment and label the square Petri dishes needed for the experiment. Pour the medium into the Petri dishes and allow the medium to solidify.\nPlate the sterilized seeds using sterile pipette tips onto square Petri dishes containing the medium. Distribute the seeds evenly in two rows. When the seeds are dry, close the lids and seal the plates. Stratify the seeds at 4 °C in the dark for 4 days.\n\t\tNOTE: Stratification is needed to synchronize germination.\nPlace the plates vertically in the growth chamber in a long-day regime (16 h of light/8 h of dark) with 25 μmol m2 s−1 light intensity and 23 °C (day/night). Grow the seedlings for 7 days.\n2. Osmotic stress treatment (optional)",
    "NOTE: This section provides details on the growth of Arabidopsis roots in osmotic potential of -1.2 MPa as estimated by cryoscopic osmometer (Table of Materials). This part can be omitted or changed depending on the experimental question at hand.\nPrepare basal MS medium + 1.5% sucrose + 400 mM mannitol + 1% agar (pH 5.7). Autoclave the medium. Pour the medium in square Petri dishes in the laminar flow hood and allow the medium to solidify.\nWith tweezers (Table of Materials), place 5-day old seedlings pre-grown in basal MS + 1.5% sucrose medium in square Petri dishes containing the medium supplemented with 400 mM mannitol. Place the plates vertically in the growth chamber in the same conditions as in step 1.2.3. Grow the seedlings under this osmotic stress condition for 7 days.\n\tNOTE: To evaluate root growth adaptation of the primary root during severe osmotic stress, it is suggested to use seedlings 5 days after germination grown in controlled conditions to ensure that the root meristem size is already established13. Alternatively, the analysis can be performed at every stage of development to determine the developmental effect of osmotic stress action.\n3. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) nanoindentation experiments\nPreparation of the sample for nanoindentation experiments",
    "NOTE: This is a crucial step for applying AFM to the study of live biological samples. The sample must be firmly attached to the substrate to be mechanically stable during indentation measurements. At the same time, sample structural qualities should be preserved. An effective strategy to stabilize a big sample for AFM is to use adhesives. The adhesive must dry quickly and must not be toxic or reactive with the surrounding medium. In this protocol, polystyrene Petri dishes were used as the substrate and non-acidic silicone glue (Table of Materials) was used to bind the Arabidopsis seedlings.\n\t\nSpread a thin layer of silicone glue into the Petri dish with a coverslip. Leave the glue in the air for 45 s.\nWith tweezers, place the seedling on the glue, orienting it in a direction that avoids contact between the seedling's protruding parts and the cantilever. Then, press the root gently to the silicone glue layer to bind it firmly. Leave the seedling in contact with the glue for 45 s before continuing with the next steps of the protocol.\nIncubate the attached seedlings with 2 μg/mL propidium iodide (PI; Table of Materials) for 5 min in dark and carefully wash them thrice with 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution (Table of Materials).\nPlace the PI-incubated seedlings into an inverted fluorescence microscope coupled with the AFM. To observe fluorescence, set the excitation and emission wavelengths at 572 nm and 617 nm, respectively. The absence of fluorescence inside the epidermal cells confirms the viability of the roots.\nCover the seedling with 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution.\nIndentation protocol",
    "NOTE: Perform all AFM measurements within 1 h after the immobilization of the sample on its support at room temperature. The room where the AFM is located should be maintained at 25 °C with an air conditioner. The PBS solution should be at the same temperature.\n\t\nMount a standard silicon nitride cantilever with a pyramidal tip (see Table of Materials) into the AFM probe holder for fluid (Table of Materials).\nAlign the laser on the cantilever close to the position of the tip. Next, move the photodiode to place the laser spot at the center of the detector.\nTo calibrate the deflection sensitivity, position a polystyrene Petri dish with 1x PBS under the AFM.\n\t\tNOTE: This step is needed to calculate the indentation. When a force measurement is made on a hard surface, there is no indentation into the surface, so any change in the z scanner displacement corresponds to the cantilever deflection. Therefore, it is very important to calibrate the deflection sensitivity on a hard surface. Using a soft surface will overestimate the deflection sensitivity, which will result in spring constants that are too low.\nAdjust the photodetector such that the non-contact deflection is near 0 V. Calibrate the deflection sensitivity by performing an indentation (force curve), with a ramp size of 3 μm, an indentation-and-retraction rate of 0.6 μm/s, and a trigger threshold of 0.5 V.\nTo calibrate the spring constant of the cantilever, use the Thermal Tune utility of the AFM software (Table of Materials) recommended for probes with spring constants less than approximately 5 N/m or use the method described in reference14. Before activating Thermal Tune in the software, ensure that the probe does not interact with the sample.",
    "Enter the cantilever temperature. Click on Calibrate > Thermal Tune or on the Thermal Tune icon in the NanoScope toolbar. Select a frequency range (1-100 Hz).\nClick on Acquire Data in the Thermal Tune panel. Wait for the AFM to acquire data, and then click on the Simple Harmonic Oscillator (Fluid) button.\nAdjust Median Filter Width to 3. Adjust PSD Bin Width to reduce the noise in the acquired data by averaging. Set fit boundaries around the first resonance peak.\nClick on Calculate Spring Constant k, and then, click on Yes in the pop-up window asking if the user wants to use this value.\nRepeat the steps described above three times and manually take an average of spring constant values. Enter this average value in the Spring Constant box in the Ramp parameter list in the PicoForce view. The calibration ends at this point.\nUsing the inverted optical microscope at 10x, 20x, and 40x eyepiece magnification, position the AFM probe on the surface of the fourth elongated epidermal cell of the primary root, ensuring to position it in the center of the cell.\nWith the calculated spring constant value (step 3.2.5.5), obtain force curves with a ramp size of 3 µm, a trigger threshold of 11 nN, and an indentation-and-retraction rate of 0.6 μm/s at selected points.\n\t\t​NOTE: Previous work15,16 found that low-frequency of indentation-and-retraction helps to minimize hysteresis and drag force.\nObtain force curves from three cells per root for each treatment (use three biological replicates per treatment). Capture at least 150 force curves for each root.\n4. Measure the apparent Young's modulus",
    "Fit each force curve to the following model for pyramidal indenters17: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63533/63533eq01.jpg, where E is the apparent Young's modulus of the sample, imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63533/63533eq02.jpg is the Poisson modulus of the sample, and α is the semi-angle to the vertex. Discard the fits with a correlation coefficient (r2) < 0.99. Consider the Poisson's ratio for totally incompressible material: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63533/63533eq02.jpg = 0.5 and the geometry of the indenter given by the manufacturers.\n\tNOTE: Use the first 100 nm from the contact point of the loading curve for the fitting to be as sensitive as possible to cell wall mechanics and to reduce the impact of turgor pressure on the apparent Young's modulus values8. The fitting has been done using a custom MATLAB program (available upon personal request by writing to J. C. B) that allows setting a specific indentation depth from the contact point of the loading curve.\nCreate a normalized histogram with the apparent Young's modulus data and fit it with a Gaussian distribution. Discard data points outside the 95% confidence interval and recalculate both the histogram and the Gaussian fit. Calculate and report the mean and standard deviation of the apparent Young's modulus.\nDetermine the significance of the comparisons between groups by multiple comparison tests like ANOVA.\nSubscription Required.
