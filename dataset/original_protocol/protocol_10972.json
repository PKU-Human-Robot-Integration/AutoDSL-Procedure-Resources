    "Dendritic cells and melanoma cells were obtained commercially18. Hepatocytes were isolated from the liver of pigs following laparoscopic partial hepatectomy22,24. Stem cells were isolated from bone marrow aspirates18,19,26. The adipose tissue-derived stem cells were obtained from the Human Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Mayo Clinic Rochester23. Human white blood cells were isolated from the collected blood received from the Division of Transfusion Medicine, Mayo Clinic Rochester25. Various cells used for radiolabeling were obtained and used in compliance with guidelines recommended by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Mayo Clinic Stem Cell Research Oversight Subcommittee, Division of Transfusion Medicine Research Committee, Institutional Biosafety Committee, and by the Radiation Safety Committee.\n1. Preparation of [ 89Zr ]Zr-p-isothiocyanatobenzyl-desferrioxamine ([ 89Zr ]Zr-DBN)\nTiming: ~160-220 min\nNOTE: For the preparation of [89Zr]Zr-DBN, isolate 89Zr in the form of [89Zr]Zr-hydrogen phosphate ([89Zr]Zr(HPO4)2) or [89Zr]Zr-chloride ([89Zr]ZrCl4), as mentioned in step 1.1.\nIsolate 89Zr from parent 89Y using an established hydroxamate resin-based purification method13,17. In brief, first prepare a column with ~100 mg of hydroxamate resin, then activate the hydroxamate resin by washing the column with 8.0 mL of pure anhydrous acetonitrile, followed by a flush with 5.0-6.0 mL of air. Then, wash the column with 15 mL of deionized water, followed by another flush with 5.0-6.0 mL of air, and then pass 2.0 mL of 0.50 N HCl (trace metal basis grade) followed by an additional flush with 5.0-6.0 mL of air. Next, load the solution containing both 89Zr and 89Y to the hydroxamate resin slowly, and wash the unbound 89Y from the hydroxamate resin with 20 mL of 2.0 N HCl, followed by 10 mL of deionized water and a flush with 5.0-6.0 mL of air.\n\tNOTE: After the flush with air, the elution of 89Zr can be performed as shown below.",
    "For eluting 89Zr in the form of [89Zr]Zr(HPO4)2, first add 0.50 mL of 1.2 M K2HPO4/KH2PO4 buffer (pH 3.5) to the column from step 1.1 and allow it to sit on the column for 30 min to promote the release of 89Zr as a [89Zr]Zr(HPO4)2 from the resin. Then, elute the 89Zr from the column with an additional 1.50 mL of 1.2 M K2HPO4/KH2PO4 buffer (pH 3.5). After the elution of [89Zr]Zr(HPO4)2, follow steps 1.2, 1.2.1, and 1.2.2 for the preparation of [89Zr]Zr-DBN using [89Zr]Zr(HPO4)2, as shown in Figure 1.\nFor obtaining 89Zr as [89Zr]ZrCl4, first elute 89Zr as [89Zr]Zr-oxalate.\n\t\t\nFor eluting 89Zr in the form of [89Zr]Zr-oxalate, add 0.50 mL of 1.0 M oxalic acid to the column from step 1.1 and allow it to sit on the column for 1 min to promote the release of 89Zr as a [89Zr]-oxalate from the resin. Then, elute the 89Zr from the column with an additional 2.50 mL of 1.0 M oxalic acid (total of 3.0 mL)17.\nTo convert [89Zr]Zr-oxalate into [89Zr]ZrCl4 using an anion exchange column, as described by Larenkov et al.14, first activate the column by washing with 6.0 mL acetonitrile, followed by a flush with 5.0-6.0 mL of air. Then, wash the column with 10.0 mL of saline, followed by another flush of 5.0-6.0 mL of air. Finally, pass 10.0 mL of deionized water, followed by a flush with 5.0-6.0 mL of air.\nLoad the 3.0 mL solution containing [89Zr]Zr-oxalate onto the activated anion exchange column slowly, followed by a flush of 5.0-6.0 mL of air. Then, wash the 89Zr-loaded column with 50.0 mL of deionized water to remove unbound oxalate ion, followed by a flush with 5.0-6.0 mL of air.",
    "For eluting 89Zr in the form of [89Zr]ZrCl4, add 0.10 mL of 1.0 N HCl to the column, allow it to sit on the column for 1.0 min to promote the release of 89Zr as [89Zr]ZrCl4 from the resin, and elute the 89Zr from the column with an additional 0.40 mL of 1.0 N HCl (total of 0.5 mL). Dry the eluted [89Zr]ZrCl4 in a V-shaped vial by placing it in a heating block at 65 °C under a steady flow of nitrogen gas for 10-30 min. After drying down, reconstitute the dried [89Zr]ZrCl4 in water and follow steps 1.3 and 1.3.1 for the preparation of [89Zr]Zr-DBN using [89Zr]ZrCl4, as shown in Figure 1.\nTake ~120 µL of [89Zr]Zr(HPO4)2, formulated in 1.2 M K2HPO4/KH2PO4 (pH 3.5) (10-25 MBq) from step 1.1.1, and neutralize the solution to achieve pH 7.5-8.0 with ~100 µL of 1.0 M HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5) and ~65 µL of 1.0 M K2CO3.",
    "To obtain the appropriate amount of DFO-Bn-NCS for steps 1.2.2 or 1.3.1 for different 89Zr formulations with a varied apparent specific activity of 89Zr, perform a set of chelation reactions using a fixed volume of a neutralized formulation of [89Zr]Zr(HPO4)2 or [89Zr]ZrCl4 with a range of DFO-Bn-NCS (7.5-15 µg). In the case of [89Zr]Zr(HPO4)2, incubate the chelation reaction at 37 °C in a shaker at ~550 rpm for 60 min. Whereas, in the case of [89Zr]ZrCl4, incubate the chelation reaction at 25 °C in a shaker at ~550 rpm for 30 min. Discard the chelation reaction that shows precipitate during or at the end of incubation. At the end of incubation, perform radioactive thin layer chromatography (rad-TLC) with 100 mM diethylenetriamine pentaacetate (DTPA), pH 7.0, as a mobile phase to estimate the chelation efficiency of DFO-Bn-NCS for each chelation reaction, as discussed below in step 1.5.\n\t\tNOTE: Based on the chelation efficiency, use the minimum amount of DFO-Bn-NCS in steps 1.2.2 or 1.3.1 needed to achieve a ≥97% chelation efficiency without causing precipitation of DFO-Bn-NCS in the neutralized formulation of [89Zr]Zr(HPO4)2 or [89Zr]ZrCl4. Herein, [89Zr]Zr-DBN was synthesized in ≥97% radiochemical purity.\nPrepare fresh 5.0 mM DFO-Bn-NCS in anhydrous DMSO (3.76 mg/mL) and add 4.0 µL of 5.0 mM DFO-Bn-NCS (20 nmol or 15 µg) to ~285 µL of neutralized [89Zr]Zr(HPO4)2 (10-25 MBq) from Step 1.2 and mix the solution by pipetting. Keep the final DMSO concentration in the chelation mixture below 2% of the total volume.\nTake ~180 µL of [89Zr]ZrCl4 formulated in 0.1 N HCl (40-80 MBq) from step 1.1.2.4 and neutralize the resultant solution to achieve pH 7.5-8.0 with ~25 µL of 1.0 M Na2CO3.",
    "Prepare fresh 2.5 mM DFO-Bn-NCS in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (1.88 mg/mL) and add 4.0 µL of 2.5 mM DFO-Bn-NCS (10 nmol or 7.5 µg) to ~205 µL of neutralized [89Zr]ZrCl4 (40-80 MBq) from step 1.3. Mix the solution by pipetting. Keep the final DMSO concentration in the chelation mixture below 2% of the total volume.\nProceed with the chelation of 89Zr at 37 °C in a shaker at ~550 rpm for 60 min in the case of [89Zr]Zr(HPO4)2, or at 25 °C in a shaker at ~550 rpm for 30 min in the case of [89Zr]ZrCl4.\nDetermine the 89Zr chelation efficiency by rad-TLC with 100 mM DTPA (pH 7.0) as the rad-TLC mobile solvent. Expect [89Zr]Zr-DBN to show a Rf of ~0.021-0.035, [89Zr]ZrCl4 to show a Rf  of ~1.0, and [89Zr]Zr(HPO4)2 to show a Rf  of ~1.0. Calculate the chelation efficiency (%) using equation (1):\n\tPercentage of 89Zr chelated to DFO-NCS to form [89Zr]Zr-DBN = [ (Radioactivity at Rf  of [89Zr]Zr - DBN) / (Sum of the Radioactivities at Rf  of [89Zr]Zr - DBN and at Rf of [89Zr]Zr(HPO4)2 or [89Zr]ZrCl4) ] × 100 (1)\n\tNOTE: The acceptable 89Zr chelation efficiency to proceed with cell radiolabeling, as determined by rad-TLC, is ≥97%. The suggested ≥97% radiochemical purity of [89Zr]Zr-DBN was set as per the standard radiochemical purity requirement for other radiopharmaceuticals used in the field. See the representative rad-TLC in Supplementary Figure S1 and Supplementary Figure S2.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64117/64117fig01v2.jpg\nFigure 1: Schematic of [89Zr]Zr-DBN preparation. For the preparation of [89Zr]Zr-DBN, neutralize preformulated [89Zr]Zr(HPO4)2 or [89Zr]ZrCl4 to a pH of 7.5-8.0. Incubate the neutralized solution with DFO-Bn-NCS.

    "Timing: ~35 min\nNOTE: Given the time it takes for the preparation of cells in step 3, start step 3 approximately 20 min before the beginning of step 2 for a ~30 min incubation. This allows cell radiolabeling in step 4 to start within ~5-10 min post-completion of steps 2-3.2.2.\nFor [89Zr]Zr-DBN formulation made from the [89Zr]ZrCl4, add 50.0 µL of a cell-compatible mixture comprising ~27.0 µL of 1.2 M K2HPO4/KH2PO4 (pH 3.5) + ~23.0 µL of 1.0 M HEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7.5) to 50.0 µL of [89Zr]Zr-DBN. Incubate the [89Zr]Zr-DBN-cell compatible mixture for ~30 min at room temperature (25 °C).\n\t​NOTE: The [89Zr]Zr-DBN formulation made from [89Zr]Zr(HPO4)2 is biocompatible for the radiolabeling of cells and does not require step 2.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64117/64117fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Preparation of the biocompatible formulation of the [89Zr]Zr-DBN for cell radiolabeling.

Radiolabeling of cells\nTiming: ~125-155 min\nInitiation of cell radiolabeling (Figure 3)\n\t\nUse the cell suspension from step 3.1.2 or step 3.2.2 to prepare a ~500 µL cell suspension with approximately ~6 × 106 cells in ~500 µL of H-HBSS at pH 7.5-8.0 in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nTo this, add ~100 µL of the biocompatibly formulated [89Zr]Zr-DBN from step 2.\nCell incubation for radiolabeling (Figure 4)\n\t\nMix the biocompatibly formulated [89Zr]Zr-DBN and the cell suspension by gently pipetting up and down with a micropipette set at ~500 µL.

    "Incubate the cells and [89Zr]Zr-DBN mixture in a shaker at ~550 rpm at 25-37 °C for 30-45 min for cell labeling.\n\t\tNOTE: The temperature of the incubation will vary depending on the cell types used for radiolabeling, as shown in Table 1.\nAfter incubation in step 4.2.2, perform rad-TLC on the cell radiolabeling reaction using freshly prepared rad-TLC solvent (20 mM sodium citrate [pH 4.9-5.1]:methanol [1:1, V:V]). After the rad-TLC run, look for [89Zr]Zr-DBN and [89Zr]ZrCl4 around Rf = ~0.73-0.81 and Rf = ~0.01-0.02 for the radiolabeled cells.
