    "Acetocarmine staining Synchronization of mitotic activityPlace pure algal biomass into a 250–500 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 150–250 mL of BBM (Figure 1A).Grow cultures in a light/dark regime of 10:14 h at 20 °C and 50 μmol photons m-2·s-1 in the light period for two to three weeks to obtain log-phase cultures.Harvesting of algal biomassCollect algal biomass at the beginning of the dark cycle in the laminar flow hood (to maintain sterility of the cultures).Place the sample with the fine-pointed tweezers into 2 mL tubes containing 1 mL of A. bidest at RT.Fix collected samples immediately after collection.FixationTransfer the samples to 10 mL glass vials containing 5 mL of 2 mM 8-hydroxyquinoline, leave at RT for 1–2 h under the fume hood, and then transfer to 4 °C for 1–2 h (Figure 1B).Note: The necessary time has to be tested out for each species. For SAG 698-1a and SAG 698-1b, 1 h each was enough, while for SAG 2419, 2 h was needed. Remove 8-hydroxyquinoline completely with a glass Pasteur pipette and wash the sample with 5 mL of A. bidest three times for at least 1 min under the fume hood.Immediately submerge samples in 5 mL of Carnoy’s fluid and leave at RT for 12 h until all chlorophyll is removed and the samples are visibly bleached (Figure 1C).StainingCollect the current bleached sample with the fine-pointed tweezers and place in the test tube containing 5 mL of 1% acetocarmine.Hold the test tube with the wooden clip over the gas burner at low flame by not constantly keeping it in the flame and boil the algal biomass in acetocarmine for 5 min under the fume hood (Figure 1D).Pour the acetocarmine-boiled algal biomass into the culture dish.",
    "Select the stained filaments with fine-pointed tweezers, place them onto a microscopic slide with a small droplet of acetocarmine, and place a coverslip on top.Microscopical analysisVisualize the stained chromosomes with a light microscope (Figure 1E).Take 50–100 images per area in Z-direction.Note: Either use an automated focus or capture images manually with a distance of 0.2–0.4 µm. Render stacked models with the software Helicon Focus (HeliconSoft Ltd.).Count the chromosomes with ImageJ.Notes:  i. The following tools in ImageJ should be used to process the stacked images; for details, see the following YouTube video by Kevin Foley: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=D1qBaFwuF4E[href=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=D1qBaFwuF4E].Process - Subtract Background Image - Adjust - Threshold Process - Binary - Fill Holes Process - Binary - Convert to Mask Process – Binary- Watershed Analyze - Analyze Particles ii. The number of chromosomes counted is based on a minimum of three biological replicates. In Figure 2D, 2E, and 2F, representative samples are illustrated. For each biological replicate, the chromosomes of at least 10 samples were counted (technical replicates). Haematoxylin staining Synchronization of mitotic activityPlace pure algal biomass into 250–500 mL tubes containing 200 mL of BBM (Figure 1A).Grow cultures in a light/dark regime of 10:14 h at 20 °C and 50 μmol photons m-2·s-1 in the light period for at least two weeks.Harvesting of algal biomassCollect algal biomass at the beginning of the dark cycle.Place the sample with fine-pointed tweezers into 2 mL tubes containing 1 mL of A. bidest at RT.Fix collected samples immediately.FixationPlace harvested material into the 10 mL glass vial containing 5 mL of Carnoy’s fluid and incubate for 2 h or until sample is completely bleached at RT (Figure 1F).Decant the Carnoy’s fluid and replace with 5 mL of 70% ethanol (samples can be stored in this mixture at 4 °C for up to half a year).",
    "Wash samples in 5 mL of A. bidest three times for at least 1 min before transferring the bleached material to a microscopic slide (mount in 45% acetic acid) and squashing with another slide (Figure 1G).Liquid nitrogen treatmentFill the liquid nitrogen container halfway up with liquid nitrogen (wear safety goggles, leather gloves, and a spray skirt for the whole procedure) and place lid on top.Open the container and use the long tongs to dip the two slides for ten seconds into the liquid nitrogen (Figure 1H).Remove the slides from the liquid nitrogen, pull them apart carefully while still frozen, and let them air dry for at least 30 min.Note: The slides can be pulled apart by hand or, if proven difficult, a spatula can be used. Let the leftover liquid nitrogen evaporate under the fume hood.HCl treatmentPlunge the dried slide with the samples attached into 5 N HCl for at least 10 min under the fume hood (Figure 1I).Remove the slide and let it air dry for another 30 min.Stain the dried slides immediately or keep them in a glass jar at -20 °C for up to half a year.StainingTo stain the material on the microscopic slides, mount it with one droplet of the aceto-haematoxylin-iron alum (Figure 1J) and place a coverslip on top.Note: A syringe equipped with a syringe filter is used to minimize the fallout particles of the solution, which could lead to contamination of the sample. Full saturation is reached after an incubation time of 5 min (Figure 1K); the excessive dye can be removed with a lint-free paper.Microscopical analysisVisualize the stained chromosomes with a light microscope (Figure 1L).Take up to 100 images per area in Z-direction.Render stacked models with the software Helicon Focus (HeliconSoft Ltd.).Count the chromosomes with ImageJ (see Section A, step 5d).",
    "Note: The numbers of chromosomes counted are based on a minimum of three biological replicates; in Figure 2G, 2H, and 2I, representative samples are illustrated. Per biological replicate, the chromosomes of at least 10 samples were counted (technical replicates)."
