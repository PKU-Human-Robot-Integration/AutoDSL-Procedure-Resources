    "1. Hand-pollination in the field\nPollen extraction\nTo obtain pollen, collect flower buds at stage D24, according to stage 57 on the BBCH scale25,26.\n\t\tNOTE: More flower buds are necessary in Japanese plum than in other Prunus species because their anthers produce less pollen.\nRemove the anthers using a plastic mesh (2 mm x 2 mm pore size) and place them on paper at room temperature for 24 h until anther dehiscence.\nSieve the pollen grains through a fine mesh (0.26 mm x 0.26 mm pore size), and conserve them in a 10 mL glass tube with a cap at 4 °C until use.\nPollination of emasculated flowers\nWhen between 10%–20% of flowers are open, select and label several branches. Remove open flowers and young buds, leaving only flower buds at stage D24, according to stage 57 on the BBCH scale25,26.\nRemove the petals, sepals, and stamens of between 800 and 1,000 flower buds per treatment with either fingernails or tweezers.\nHand pollinate the pistils with the help of a fine paintbrush 24 h after emasculation. Some branches containing half of the pistils with pollen of the same cultivar, and the other half with compatible pollen from other cultivar as a control. Be careful not to contaminate the fingertip or paintbrush with pollen grains from other cultivars.\nRecord weekly counts of flowers and developing fruits to characterize fruit drop pattern and quantify the final fruit set in each pollination treatment.\nSupplementary pollination in the field\nA few days before the first flowers open, enclose selected trees in a 0.8 mm mesh cage to avoid the arrival of pollinating insects.\nWhen 10%–20% flowers are open, select and label several branches per pollination treatment, leaving 1,000–1,500 flowers per treatment.",
    "On the next day, when flowers are open, pollinate each flower with the help of a paintbrush with the corresponding pollen (pollen from the same cultivar for self-pollination, and from other compatible cultivars as cross-pollination control).\nPollinate every other day until all flowers open.\nRecord weekly counts of flowers and developing fruits from anthesis to harvest to characterize fruit drop pattern and quantify final fruit set in each pollination treatment.\n2. Hand-pollinations in the laboratory\nCollect 50–100 flowers at stage D24, according to stage 57 on the BBCH scale25,26.\nIn the laboratory, emasculate 30 flowers per treatment (self- and cross-pollination).\n\tNOTE: Emasculation should be proceeded carefully to avoid any damage on the pistils.\nMake a fresh cut on the base of each flower pedicel underwater before placing it on a piece of wet florist foam (one piece of foam for each pollination treatment).\nHand pollinate each pistil 24 h later using a fine paintbrush with pollen collected previously (see section 1.1). Pollinate one set of pistils with pollen from the same cultivar, and the other set with pollen from a compatible cultivar as control.\nLeave the pollinated pistils 72 h after pollination at room temperature. The floral foam should be continuously wet with water.\nFix the pistils in a fixative solution of ethanol/acetic acid (3:1) for at least 24 h at 4 °C. Replace the fixative with 75% ethanol. Samples can be conserved in this solution at 4 °C until use27.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that the samples are completely submerged in the solution.\n3. Microscopic observations\nEvaluation of in vitro pollen germination\nTo elaborate pollen germination medium, dissolve 25 g of sucrose on 250 mL of distilled water, then add 0.075 g of calcium nitrate [Ca(NO3)2] and 0.075 g of boric acid (H3BO3).",
    "Add 2 g of agar to the solution and mix until completely dissolved28.\nTo sterilize the medium, autoclave it at 120 °C for 20 min. Cool the medium and, before it solidifies, distribute 3 mL per sterile Petri dish (55 mm x 12 mm) in a sterile laminar flow hood. After medium solidification, conserve the Petri dishes wrapped in aluminum foil at 4 °C until use.\nSpread the pollen of each cultivar previously used as pollen donor in the controlled pollinations in two Petri dishes and incubate them at 25 °C for 24 h.\n\t\tNOTE: The inoculated culture media can be observed with microscopy immediately after or stored at -20 °C until use. For this purpose, the Petri dishes should be changed from the freezer to the fridge 24 h before microscopy observations.\nTo observe the pollen grains, prepare 1% (v/v) aniline blue solution that stains callose. First, prepare a 0.1 N potassium phosphate tribasic (K3PO4) solution by dissolving 7.97 g of K3PO4 in 1,000 mL of distilled water. To elaborate the 1% (v/v) aniline blue solution, dissolve 1 mL of aniline blue in 100 mL of 0.1 N K3PO4.\nAdd 2–3 drops of aniline blue solution to each Petri dish plate and observe after 5 min under a UV epifluorescence microscope using exciter filter BP340-390 and barrier filter LP425. Count viable and non-viable pollen grains in three fields per plate, each field containing 100-200 pollen grains, in two Petri dishes for each cultivar.\nPollen tube growth\nRinse the fixed pistils with distilled water three times (1 h each, 3 h in total) and transfer to 5% (w/v) sodium sulphite (Na2SO3) at 4 °C for 24 h. To prepare this solution, dissolve 5 g of sodium sulphite in 100 mL of distilled water.",
    "Autoclave the pistils at 120 °C for 8 min in 5% (w/v) sodium sulphite to soften the tissues.\nSquash softened pistils in a drop of 1% (v/v) aniline blue solution under a cover glass on a slide to stain callose.\nObserve pollen tube growth along the style under a microscope with UV epifluorescence using exciter filter BP340-390 and barrier filter LP425.\n4. Determining incompatibility relationships\nDNA extraction from leaves\n\t\nTo extract DNA, collect 3–4 young leaves of each cultivar in the field, preferably in spring.\n\t\tNOTE: DNA can also be extracted from mature leaves, but DNA from young leaves has less phenolic compounds.\nIsolate DNA using a commercial kit and follow the provided protocol kit (see Table of Materials).\nQuantify the DNA concentration and evaluate the quality of the DNA of each sample at 260 nm in an UV-Vis microvolume spectrophotometer. Adjust the DNA concentration to 10 ng/μL.\nPCR conditions for fragment amplification\n\t\nLabel 0.2 mL PCR tubes and caps.\nPrepare the PCR reagents according to Table 1 and let them thaw on ice.\nSet up a volume of master mix of each pair of primers in a 1.5 mL microtube according to the number of reactions plus 10% of excess, considering a volume of 16 μL per reaction. Add the reagents following the order in Table 1 and mix thoroughly.\nAliquot 16 μL of master mix into each 0.2 mL PCR tube containing 4 μL of DNA template or 4 μL of sterilized distilled water as negative control (C-). Use DNA of cultivars with known genotype as positive controls. Mix gently, close the reaction tubes with the caps, and centrifugate at 2,000 x g for 30 s to collect the entire volume at the bottom of the reaction tube.",
    "Place the reaction tubes in the thermocycler and set up the PCR program using the following temperature profile: an initial step of 3 min at 94 °C, 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 56 °C and 3 min at 72 °C, and a final step of 7 min at 72 °C20.\nElectrophoresis and estimation of fragment size\n\t\nTo prepare a 1.7% (w/v) agarose mini gel, dissolve 0.68 g of agarose and 40 mL of 1x TBE buffer into a 100 mL Erlenmeyer flask. Melt the solution by heating in a microwave at 600 W at 30 s intervals to avoid boiling.\nLet the solution stay on the bench to cool down, and then add 3.5 μL of nucleic acid staining solution.\nPlace the gel tray into the casting stand and put the selected comb into the gel mold. Be sure to have enough wells for each PCR product and DNA ladder.\nPour the agarose solution into the gel mold and let it cool down until polymerization. Remove the comb of the polymerized gel. Place the gel in the horizontal electrophoresis system containing enough 1x TBE buffer to cover the surface of the gel.\nLoad the first and last wells with 2 μL of the DNA molecular weight ladder (1 kb DNA Ladder). Load 3 μL of each product of the PCR in the other wells. Close the chamber, turn on the power, and run the gel at 100 V for 30 min.\nObserve the gel under UV light using a gel documentation system. Use the DNA molecular weight ladder to determine the size of the amplified fragment and compare it with the positive controls in order to identify the corresponding alleles.\n5. Monitoring flower dates",
    "Monitor the phenology of different trees of each cultivar at flowering over different years. Establish the length of the flowering period from the first (about 5%) to the last open flowers (about 95%). Full bloom is considered when at least 50% of flowers are at stage F24, according to stage 65 on the BBCH scale25,26.\nTo compare the flowering dates of inter-compatible cultivars and determine those that coincide at flowering time every year, elaborate a calendar of flowering times with data from several years.\nSubscription Required.
