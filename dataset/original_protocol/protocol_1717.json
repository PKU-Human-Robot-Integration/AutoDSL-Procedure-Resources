    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAn outline of the procedures is described in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]. A total of 500 μL respiratory specimens was heat-inactivated using heat block at 95°C for 15 min in a BSL3 lab. Heat inactivated respiratory specimens were subjected to homogenization by probe sonicator (steps 1–6). Respiratory metabolites were extracted by organic phase extraction method (steps 7–18) for untargeted metabolomics using LCMS (steps 19–20). The obtained data are analyzed using the Compound discoverer version 3.1 (steps 21–31).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1305-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Showing an outline of the respiratory specimen collection, preparation, and data analysis\nHeat inactivation of virus\nTiming: 15 min/sample\nThis step is crucial to inactivate the virus as a safety measure to mitigate the risk of infection during sample preparation.\nThe collected respiratory specimens are placed on a heating block at 95°C for 15 min (Batejat et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) to inactivate the virus.\nPause point: Respiratory specimen can be stored in −80°C upto 4 weeks\nHomogenization of respiratory specimen\nTiming: 5–7 min/sample\nRespiratory specimens may contain host cells, mucus, bacterial and viral components. Thus, it is essential to homogenize the samples.\nCritical: The high frequency sound emitted by the sonicator can damage hearing. Therefore place the sample in a noise isolating chamber and always close the door while operating. Do not grasp an activated horn or touch the tip of a vibrating probe. It can cause severe burns and tissue damage.\nTake 100 μL of respiratory specimen in a new microcentrifuge tube (MCT) and keep it on ice during homogenization.\nPlace the sample in a noise isolating chamber and submerge the sonicator probe into the sample.\nNote: The probe should not touch the walls of MCT as it will break the tube and destroy the sample.",
    "Close the door of the chamber after correctly placing the sample tube.\nRun the program at Power 20%, Run time 5 min (Cycle - 10 s ON, 10 s OFF) and temperature 22°C.\nRemove and clean the probe with ethanol.\nNote: Keep the sample on ice during all the homogenization steps step 2–6.\nPause point: Respiratory specimen can be stored in −80°C upto 4 weeks\nOrganic phase metabolite extraction\nTiming: ∼15 h/sample\nTo reduce the complexity of the sample, proteins must be removed. Hence, organic phase extraction will remove the proteins through precipitation and dissolve the metabolites in solution.\nAdd 100 uL of homogenized respiratory specimen to 400 uL of 100% chilled methanol.\nVortex it for 10 s.\nKeep it in −20°C for 10–12 h.\nCentrifuge the sample at 18,000g for 10 min.\nTake the supernatant into a new tube and discard the pellet.\nFreeze-dry the sample completely using a vacuum concentrator.\nDissolve the sample in 105 uL of solvent (5% ACN (Acetonitrile), 5% Internal Standard, 95% water).\nVortex the sample for 10 s.\nPipette 80 uL of sample solution into HPLC tube.\nAdd the remaining 25 μL in a different tube to prepare a pooled quality control sample (In this tube all the samples prepared for run are pooled together).\nNote: QC samples are required to correct the small levels of variation within samples from the same group, to quantitatively measure technical reproducibility and to integrate data from different analytical experiments. The peak features exceeding 30% coefficient of variation (CV) values and less than 0.7 r2 for Coefficient of correlation in QC samples are excluded.\nMake a dilution of the Pool solution.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1305_8.csv\nMake a blank with 100% ACN.\nSample run and analysis\nTiming: 30–40 min/sample\nThis step provides you MS.raw file for each sample for further analysis.",

Showing mass spectral peak of standard metabolites\nData analysis using Compound discoverer ver. 3.1:\nCompound Discoverer is a unique small molecule structure recognition software. It uses accurate mass data, isotope pattern matching, fragment matching, and mass spectral library search to identify the structure of small molecules. It is a qualitative data processing application that can process accurate mass spectra of the entire Thermo Scientific high-resolution mass spectrometer product line. Compound Discoverer provides a set of processing tools called Nodes, which can be combined into a processing workflow in many different ways according to the type of experiment you perform and the questions you must answer. These workflows can be saved and reused as templates. Additionally, users can even design and write their own nodes for use in Compound Discoverer.\nOpen the Compound discoverer ver. 3.1 application.
