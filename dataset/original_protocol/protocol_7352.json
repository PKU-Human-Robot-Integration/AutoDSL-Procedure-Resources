    "Preparation of the onion cell wall peels Note: This protocol involves the use of liquid nitrogen and other cryogenic liquids that could lead to severe burning if not handled properly. Please refer to your institution’s safety guidelines for manipulation of these liquids. For all the following steps described in this manuscript, samples after vitrification should always be handled with pre-cooled tools, so always precool the tools before touching the grids or grid boxes to avoid devitrification of the sample. Gather fresh, hard, hydrated white onions (see Note 1).Cut off the tips of the onion and take off the dried, brownish superficial layers until the first fresh layer is reached (Video 1, step 1). This is layer one (Figure 1A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4559/bioprotoc-12-23-4559-g001.jpgFigure 1. Anatomy of an onion scale and generation of the epidermal cell wall peels.  (A) Global view of a longitudinally cut onion. (B) Side and top views (left and middle, respectively) of an onion scale. Black lines indicate the first incisions to be done to cut away the tips. Red lines indicate the incisions to be done to create the rectangular cell wall peels. Right, top view of three separate rectangular-like scale explants with the black lines indicating the incisions to be made to create handles that will be used to generate the peels in the next step. (C) Top row: left shows top views of three rectangular-like scale explants. Here, the abaxial epidermis is facing upwards (glowing, waxy side) and is the side to be used to generate the cell wall peel. Middle shows a piece of onion scale in the process of being peeled. The clear membrane is the cell wall peel. Right shows two cell wall peels with the two handles at their extremity incubating in HEPES buffer. Bottom row: side view diagrams of the peeling process.",
    "Left shows a scale just incised, so that the abaxial epidermal layer has not been cut (black dashed lines). The two side squares are the handles to pull on in order to create the cell wall peel. Middle shows the beginning of the process where the handle is pulled away from the main body of the scale to tear away the abaxial epidermal layer. Right shows the epidermal peel where the abaxial epidermal cells were ripped in half. The two handles on the side are used to manipulate the peel. (D) Contrast phase image of a successfully peeled abaxial epidermal cell wall. The anticlinal cell walls show jagged edges. See also Video 1.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Peeling of the onion.The peeling procedure to create the cell wall peels from intact onions is described; it is divided into five steps: i) preparation of the onion, ii) sampling the scales, iii) preparing the scales, iv) peeling the cell wall, and v) screening of the cell wall peel.Create two deep longitudinal incisions going down to the core of the onion. These incisions should cover approximately a quarter of the onion (90°) (Video 1, step 2).Take apart the scales from this excised part. The scales are concave (Figure 1B) and the abaxial side, where the peels will be created, faces outside (convex part). Keep note of the order of the scales.Cut off the tips of the scale (a few centimeters from the tips) and keep the central large part of the scale (Figure 1B, black dashed lines, and Video 1, step 3).Cut this central part longitudinally in several bands, each approximately 3 cm long and 1 cm wide (Figure 1B, red dashed lines, and Video 1, step 3). There should now be several rectangular excisions from the scale (3 × 1 cm).",
    "The waxy, hydrophobic side is the epidermis and the more porous side will be discarded later.For each band, create two transversal incisions 0.5 cm away from the extremities on the adaxial porous side. These incisions should go through the entire scale, except the waxy abaxial thin membrane, i.e., the epidermal cell wall (Figure 1B and C and Video 1, step 4). The excised scales should now have two floppy extremities, here called handles (Video 1, step 4).Grab one of the handles, fold over towards the epidermal cell wall and pull by brief powerful strokes to rip the abaxial epidermal cells in half. A Velcro sound should be heard (Video 1, step 4).A continuous membrane between the two thick handles indicates successful cell wall peeling (Figure 1C).Cut off one of the handles and mount the peel between glass slide and cover slip. Screen the peel by light microscopy to control its quality. Only peels with close to 100% ripped cells are kept for freezing (Figure 1D, Video 1, step 5).Incubate the peels in HEPES 20 mM buffer (see Recipe 1) for 20 min to clean out cellular remnants off the cell wall peel.Plunge freezing of the cell wall peels Note: The onion cell wall peels need to be presented parallel to the FIB beam for optimal milling. It is therefore important to keep track of the direction of the cells within the peel during freezing, clipping, and mounting of the grids in the FIB-SEM, despite not being able to see the cells (see Note 4). Turn on the Vitrobot and prepare the liquid nitrogen and ethane/propane cup (Video 2, step 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Plunge freezing of the cell wall peels.",
    "The cell wall peel vitrification procedure is described: i) preparing the freezing well, ii) glow discharging the grids, iii) cutting up the cell wall peel to fit on an EM grid, iv) setting the cell wall peel explant on the EM grid, and v) grid blotting and plunge freezing.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20221204/20221204172946_5329.jpgFigure 2. Plunge freezing of the cell wall peels. (A) Global view of the freezing setup: 1- Vitrobot, 2- Freezing well, 3- Various tweezers and forceps, 4- Petri dish with HEPES buffer and cell wall peels, 5- Glass slide where the cell wall peel will be dissected, 6- Light shining tangential to the table, 7- Liquid nitrogen dewar, 8- Liquid nitrogen container for grid boxes, 9- Propane/ethane filling station, and 10- Desk lamp shining at the well for extra visibility while transferring vitrified grids to the grid boxes. (B) Top view of a cell wall peel, where one handle (left one) has been removed. Black dashed lines indicate the first incisions to be made. Red dashed lines indicate the latter incisions to be made to generate small rectangles to be positioned on the EM grid. (C) Top view of a London Finder Quantifoil grid with a cell wall peel positioned along the grid notch. The right inset shows that the long axis of the onion cells is more or less parallel to the direction of the main notch. See also Video 2.Glow-discharge the grids at 20 mA for 1 min (Video 2, step 2).Gather all necessary tools and equipment to prepare the rectangles of the cell wall next to the plunge freezer (Figure 2A).Prepare labeled grid boxes (see Note 2) and long forceps with blotting pad at the end.Place the cell wall peel on a glass slide with a drop of HEPES buffer. Never let the peel dry out.",
    "Shine a bright light tangential to the glass slide towards the experimenter in order to see the edges of the thin cell wall peel (Video 2, step 3).Optionally, if certain extremities of the peel look sub-optimal, cut and discard them, so that the region to be used is accessible now.Use the Vitrobot tweezers to securely grab the Quantifoil EM grid at the triangular notch (Figure 2C shows the Quantifoil notch, Video 2, step 3).Using a sharp razor blade, apply constant pressure on the peel extremity to make clean incisions, parallel to the long side of the peel, approximately 1 cm long if possible. Reiterate this process on the whole width of the peel in order to have clean parallel incisions equal in length (Figure 2B black dashed lines, Video 2, step 3).Make clean incisions perpendicular to the ones generated in step B9 starting on one side of the peel. This will free a small rectangle of approximately 3 × 1 mm that can fit on an EM Quantifoil grid (Figure 2B red dashed lines, Video 2, step 3).With the other hand and another pair of tweezers, grab the very tip of the short end of one of the rectangular peels and drag it on the grid so that the long side of the peel is parallel to the grid notch (Figure 2C, Video 2, step 4).Load the Vitrobot tweezers in the Vitrobot chamber by clipping it on the lowered rod and press on the pedal to raise the tweezers in the chamber (Video 2, step 4).Blotting settings: humidity 50%, 20 °C.",
    "Grids are first manually back blotted for approximately 6 s and then the pedal is pressed to initiate two iterations of automatic blotting front and back (5 s, maximal blot force of 25 and drain time of 3 s) (Video 2, step 5).Store the grids in the grid boxes (see Note 2).Iterate steps B8 to B15 for making more grids.When done, store the grid boxes in the liquid nitrogen storage dewar (Video 2, step 5).Grid clipping Note: Detailed clipping will not be described as this has been done elsewhere (Wagner et al., 2020) and can be found online (https://em-learning.com/totara/dashboard/index.php[href=https://em-learning.com/totara/dashboard/index.php]). It is however emphasized in Note 4 how to align the milling notch of the autogrid with the long side of the onion peel. Load the C-rings in the clipping pens. Prepare as much as necessary.Optionally, if using the Thermo Fisher FIB autogrids, mark the sides of the grid on the opposite side from the notch (for easily locating the notch in future steps) using a Sharpie.Place the FIB autogrids in the clipping station.Cool down the clipping station and place the lid to avoid ice contamination to accumulate in the station. Perform all subsequent operations with the lid on.Clip each grid, carefully aligning the milling notch of the autogrid with the long side of the peel, making sure that the peel is facing down in order to have it exposed to the FIB/SEM beams in the latter steps (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4559/bioprotoc-12-23-4559-g003.jpgFigure 3. Clipping vitrified grids with FIB autogrids. Top and side view (left and right, respectively) of a clipped grid. Top view emphasizes how the cell wall peel (and the notch of the grid) needs to be aligned with the notch of the autogrid to allow milling parallel to the cell wall peel.",
    "The black dots are landmarks visible by the naked eye to allow orienting the FIB autogrid. The side view emphasizes that the peel needs to be exposed on the rounded part of the autogrid. When clipping in the clipping station, this means that the grid needs to be facing down. This allows the sample to be exposed to the FIB beam.Cryo-FIB milling Note: The process of cryo-FIB milling is also thoroughly described elsewhere (Schaffer et al., 2015; Wagner et al., 2020). Emphasis will be put on a few key points relevant if using the cryo-transfer chamber Quorum PP3000T and a Versa 3D DualBeam FIB-SEM. Optionally, if GIS coating is intended, tune the temperature of the GIS needle to 26 °C.Cool down the loading well with the shuttle inserted vertically (Figure 4A and 4B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4559/bioprotoc-12-23-4559-g004.jpgFigure 4. Loading of the clipped grids in the FIB/SEM with the Quorum PP3000T system. (A) Global view of the cryo-FIB/SEM setup. CHE3010T is the liquid nitrogen tank that cools down the flowing nitrogen, keeping the sample at cryogenic temperature. (B) Top view of the well where the grids are loaded in the shuttle. The shuttle is mounted on a hinge system and is seen vertical in this example. (C) Top: Picture of the shuttle that can fit two grids. Bottom: Top view of the grid loaded in the shuttle (left) and simplified diagram of the clamping system (right). Notice the milling notch and peel are facing upwards. This is crucial for successful milling. (D) FIB views of the milling process of a lamella in the periclinal cell wall. The lamella is boxed in orange. What is seen above and below the lamella is in the background. (E) SEM view of the final lamella shown in (D).",
    "Notice that the lamella is surrounded by dark holes above and below it. This ensures that the electron beam in the TEM will have a clear path through the lamella to the detector.Transfer grid boxes with clipped grids to the well.Load the grids in the two slots (it is also possible to load the grids one by one to avoid too much in-chamber ice contamination during milling) and make sure milling notch is positioned vertically (see Note 4, Figure 4C). This will ensure that the peel is presented parallel to the FIB beam.Pump down the well, load the shuttle on the transfer rod, and connect the rod to the cryo-preparation chamber.Note: Cryogenic temperature during the transfer of the rod from the well to the preparation chamber is solely maintained by the vacuum. It is imperative to go as quickly as possible during this step to avoid devitrification. Platinum sputter coat at 15 mA for 60 s.Transfer the shuttle from the preparation chamber to the SEM chamber.Screen the grid and identify areas of interest.For each spot, save the x and y coordinates, proceed to setting the stage to eucentric height, and update their z coordinate (see Note 5).For each spot, set up beam coincidence and update their z coordinate (see Note 5).Optionally, if using the GIS needle for adding an extra coating layer of platinum, proceed as follows:Go to a spot away from the loaded grids. For convenience, save the coordinates as “flush out spot” in order to call this position easily in the future.Lock stage position.Take a demagnified picture to make sure the stage is out of the field of view.Insert GIS needle and open valves for approximately 15 s as a flush out step.Take a picture to make sure needle is inserted.Retract needle and unlock stage position.",
    "Take a picture to make sure needle is retracted.Recall milling position.Set Z height to eucentric +2 mm.Lock stage position.Insert GIS needle and open valves for approximately 3–5 s.Retract needle and take picture to make sure it retracted.Unlock stage position.Note: In between each milling step, astigmatism and focus must be checked away from the milling region. Set stage angle as low as possible without hindering the field of view of the FIB beam (see Note 6).Set the SEM imaging conditions to 5 kV and 27 pA in order to accurately assess lamella thickness.Set beam intensity to 1 nA and milling pattern to “Clean Cross Section” (CCS) and select the “Si-ccs” application with a dwell time of 1 μs and a Z size between 1 and 3 μm (Figure 4D and Table 1), until the initial lamella is approximately 3 μm thick.Set beam intensity to 0.5 nA (Figure 4D and Table 1).Note: According to Schaffer et al. (2017), in order to have a homogenously thick lamella, the lamella has to be rocked back and forth when milling the underside and the topside, respectively. Increase angle +1° and shave off approximately 1 μm of the top of the lamella (Table 1).Increase angle -1° and shave off approximately 1 μm of the bottom of the lamella (Table 1). The lamella should be approximately 1 μm thick (Figure 4D).Set beam intensity to 100 pA (Table 1).Increase angle +0.5° and shave off approximately 200 nm of the top of the lamella (Table 1).Increase angle -0.5° and shave off approximately 200 nm of the bottom of the lamella (Table 1). The lamella should be approximately 600 nm (Figure 4D).Set beam intensity to 30 pA (Table 1).",
    "Set the angle to the original milling angle and shave off the top of the lamella until it reaches its final thickness of approximately 200 nm (Figure 4D).Optionally, to reach final thickness, beam intensity can be set to 10 pA.Note: It is important to have set beam coincidence in order to be able to monitor lamella thickness, especially towards the final stages of milling where the lamella is getting thin and very fragile (see Note 7 for more details). Iterate steps D12 to D23 for other milling targets on the grid.When switching to other grid, set the stage angle to 0 and pan over to the other grid.Note: For ease of navigation save left and right grid slot positions in order to easily recall these positions. Iterate steps D8 to D23 for screening and milling the other grid.When done screening both grids, set the stage angle to 0° and come back to loading position.Note: For ease of navigation, loading position should also be saved for easy recall. Close valves of the electron and FIB beam.Fetch the shuttle with the transfer rod and transfer it to the cryo-preparation chamber.Transfer back the shuttle into the precooled preparation well.Secure the grids back into the grid box.For loading and screening/milling new grids, iterate steps D4 to D31.Cryo-ET screening and tilt series acquisition Note: Only the key points of loading the grids for observing lamellae will be emphasized. In-depth information can be found online (https://em-learning.com/login/index.php[href=https://em-learning.com/login/index.php]). This run-through is relevant for the use of the Titan Krios cryo-TEM operated through SerialEM, a highly modular, scriptable software (Mastronarde, 2003). The steps detailed here to acquire the tilt series are meant for data acquisition on lamella as performed in Nicolas et al. (2022).",

    "Loading procedure is divided into five steps: i) cooling down of the loading station, ii) cooling down of the NanoCab, iii) transfer of the grid boxes in the loading station, iv) loading of the grids in the Krios cassette, and v) loading of the Krios cassette in the Titan Krios microscope. Note that the experimenter in this video is not wearing the recommended protective eyewear and insulating gloves.Transfer grid box with milled grids in transfer station (Video 3, step 3).Put the grids in the slots of the cassette, so that the long axis of the lamellae is perpendicular to the tilt axis of the grid holder, leaving slot #1 free (commonly used slot for cross-grading grid) (see Note 8, Figure 5B, and Video 3, step 4).Using the handle in the loading station, clamp the cassette and push it in the NanoCab (Video 3, step 4).Transfer the NanoCab to the docking station of the microscope and load the cassette (Video 3, step 5).When the cassette is loaded, let the cartridge gripper cool down to < -165° and start an inventory of the cassette.Load a grid.In the Low Dose panel, tick Low Dose Mode (Figure 5C, red square).Generate a low magnification (search mode, x82) atlas of the grid to spot the lamellae (Figure 5D): Navigator > Open (will open a new Navigator panel); Navigator > Montage & Grids > Setup Full Montage (see Note 9); select the place holder of the file and the name of the atlas file.Montage Controls > Start.

    "In this example, a tilt series ±50° with a base increment of 3° using a dose symmetric scheme (see dose symmetric pop-up window in red and description below) with a target defocus of -8 μm. Optionally, the exposure can be set to vary according to tilt angle in order to distribute the dose optimally (blue rectangles). In the dose symmetric panel, at least two of the parameters need to be set (green rectangles). In this example, initial group size was set to 5 and alternation is set to end at 30°. This means that from 0 to ±30°, the stage will rock back and forth every five tilt images. After 30°, the stage will go linearly from ±30° to ±50°. (B) Acquire at items window. The typical checkboxes to activate are highlighted in red. This means that the stage will recall the position of the area to acquire, align it using the anchor maps as reference (realign to item), auto center the beam, do rough and fine eucentricity on the position, do autofocus, and start the tilt series. Valves will be closed when all tilt series are acquired. (C) Slice of a cryo-tomogram acquired on a cell wall lamella. The long rod-like densities are the cellulose fibers.
