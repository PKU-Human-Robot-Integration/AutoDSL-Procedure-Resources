    "This basic protocol describes the step-by-step procedures involved in UMI labeling and two rounds of PCR amplification. This protocol assumes users have already prepared their DNA samples of interest.

Design the UMI primer using software such as Primer3, NCBI primer blast, or other equivalent tools, and order the UMI primer mix with PAGE purification from a reputable oligo synthesis service provider.",
    "The UMI primer comprises three essential regions: a 3′ gene-specific sequence, a UMI sequence, and a 5′ universal primer sequence. The design of the 3′ gene-specific region adheres to conventional PCR primer design principles. The schematic representation of the primer design is depicted in Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.888#cpz1888-fig-0001] (Bi et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.888#cpz1888-bib-0004]). The UMI sequence comprises multiple random bases (indicated by Ns). The number of random bases is determined by the number of targeted nucleotides. The 5′ universal primer region enables consistent amplification of all UMI-tagged DNAs and minimizes non-specific binding within the targeted region (see Critical Parameters for additional details).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/00361eda-2214-4bfa-a4da-f3f3332fa7d4/cpz1888-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1",
    "Schematic of the UMI labeling primer design. UMI labeling is a technique used to identify individual DNA molecules uniquely. This is done by adding a short sequence of nucleotides, a UMI, to each DNA molecule. UMI primers are intended to attach UMIs to each DNA molecule. A UMI primer consists of three segments: a 3' gene-specific sequence (marked in red), a UMI sequence (marked in yellow), and a 5' universal primer sequence (marked in green). The 3' gene-specific sequence is designed to bind to a specific target gene region. The UMI sequence is a random sequence of nucleotides unique to each UMI primer. The 5' universal primer sequence is employed to amplify all DNA molecules tagged with UMIs. IDMseq is a UMI-based method that barcodes DNA molecules using a single round of primer extension instead of the multiple rounds of PCR that are typically used. Then, the universal primers will remove the forward UMI primers before amplification. In two-ended labeling (not applicable in current IDMseq pipeline), a second round of primer extension is performed with reverse UMI primers after removing the forward UMI primers. The UMI-labeled DNA is amplified with universal primer and gene-specific reverse primer before sequencing (Bi et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.888#cpz1888-bib-0004]).\nUMI labeling and DNA amplification\n2. Quantify the input DNA concentration using a Qubit 4 fluorometer or its equivalent and estimate the purity using a Nanodrop 8000 spectrophotometer or its equivalent.\nIt is recommended to use the DNA with good purity. A 260 nm/280 nm value of 1.7-1.9 usually yields good results. Fragment size analysis is not necessary, as we find DNA produced with column-based extraction methods, such as from the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit, yields satisfactory results.",
    "3. Transfer 50 to 100 ng of input gDNA (up to 10 μl) into a 0.2-ml thin-walled PCR tube. Use nuclease-free H2O to make up the volume.\n4. Set up the UMI labeling reaction as follows:\n         \n50 to 100 ng gDNA\n1 μM UMI labeling primer mix (a pool of oligos containing random sequences in the UMI segment and shared fixed sequences, see Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.888#cpz1888-fig-0001] for design strategy)\n12.5 μl 2× Platinum SuperFi PCR Master Mix\nH2O to make up the final volume of 25 μl\n5. Execute the UMI labeling on a thermocycler with a ramp rate of 1°C/s using the following:\n         \n98°C 1 min\n70°C 5 s\n69°C 5 s\n68°C 5 s\n67°C 5 s\n66°C 5 s\n65°C 5 s\n72°C (1 min/kb of DNA of interest)\n4°C hold\nThe UMI labeling is a one-step primer extension with a high-fidelity DNA polymerase. The reaction setup is similar to a standard PCR but with a single UMI primer.\n6. Perform AMPure beads cleanup of DNA (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.888#cpz1888-prot-0002]).\nThis step also removes the excess UMI primer.\n7. Perform PCR amplification using the universal primer and the gene-specific reverse primer. The PrimeSTAR GXL DNA polymerase is recommended in this step. Follow the manufacturer's guidelines.\n8. Perform AMPure beads cleanup of DNA (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.888#cpz1888-prot-0002]).\n9. To estimate the concentration and quality of the obtained DNA, use a Qubit 4 fluorometer or equivalent for the concentration and a Nanodrop 8000 or equivalent for the quality.\nNanopore sequencing\n10. Construct the Nanopore sequencing library with the Ligation Sequencing Kit by following the manufacturer's instructions.",
    "11. Perform Nanopore long-read sequencing with an appropriate flow cell (e.g., FLO-MIN114 for R10.4.1 flow cell on a MinION sequence device) by following the manufacturer's instructions. Ensure supportive computational hardware. Ensure appropriate selection of kits, output file format, and output location. Opt for live basecalling using the guppy basecaller provided by Oxford Nanopore Technologies to convert the raw signals into DNA sequences in fastq format.\nGuppy basecalling can be executed using either CPU or GPU resources. Utilizing a CUDA-enabled NVIDIA GPU (compute version of 6.1 or higher) is highly recommended for optimal efficiency.\nIDMseq is designed to be adaptable to various sequencing platforms. Users can choose other appropriate platforms (e.g., Illumina, and PacBio) according to the need.\nData processing and analysis\n12. Follow the desired workflow for alignment and data analysis (see Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.888#cpz1888-prot-0003] for a suggested pipeline).",
    "This protocol offers guidance on using AMPure XP beads to purify and concentrate DNA samples in Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.888#cpz1888-prot-0001]. Oxford Nanopore Technologies recommends the use of AMPure XP beads for this purpose, as it has demonstrated successful recovery of samples with minimal loss.\nMaterials\nAMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, cat. no. A63882)\nSample tubes to be purified (from Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.888#cpz1888-prot-0001], step 6)\nEthanol (Merck, cat. no. 100983)\nNuclease-free H2O\n      \nVortex mixer\nMini centrifuge\nMagnetic rack\n1.5-ml DNA LoBind microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf, cat. no. 022431021)\n1. Allow the AMPure XP beads to equilibrate at room temperature for 30 min.\n2. Resuspend the beads immediately by vortexing before use.\n3. Add the above AMPure beads to the sample tubes in a 1:1 ratio (e.g., 25 μl sample and 25 μl beads).\nPipette up and down (twenty times) gently to prevent bubble formation or flick the tube to facilitate even mixing.\n4. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min and perform step 5 during the 5 min incubation period.\n5. Make fresh 70% ethanol using nuclease-free H2O.\n∼600 μl is needed per tube.\n6. Using a mini centrifuge, briefly centrifuge the tubes containing the samples at maximum speed.\n7. Keep the tube on a magnetic rack and pellet beads until the supernatant is clear.\nThe beads usually form a tight pellet within 1 to 2 min.\n8. Slowly discard the supernatant.\nAvoid touching the pelleted beads with the pipette tips during this step.\n9. Wash the beads with 200 μl of 70% fresh ethanol. Prepare a fresh 70% ethanol stock solution before experimenting (step 5). While the sample is still on the magnetic stand, add 200 μl of 70% ethanol without disturbing the bead pellet.\nDo not remove the samples from the magnetic stand for the entire process.",
    "10. Repeat steps 8 and 9 two more times.\nRemove the supernatant as much as possible during the final wash without disturbing the beads.\n11. Remove the tube from the magnetic rack and microcentrifuge briefly at maximum speed.\n12. Return the tube to the magnetic rack for 2 min.\n13. Discard any residual ethanol.\n14. Allow the pellet to air dry for 1 min.\nEnsure that the ethanol was removed from the tube completely without over-drying.\n15. To elute the DNA off the beads, add 10.5 μl nuclease-free H2O and mix well by pipetting. Incubate the sample at room temperature for 5 min, then place the samples on the magnetic stand for 5 min or until the solution is clear and colorless.\nUsers can extend the incubation time (up to 10 min) to increase the recovery if the pellet is over-dried.\n16. Transfer 10 μl of the eluate to a clean 1.5-ml DNA LoBind microcentrifuge tube."
