    "The protocol follows the guidelines of Fundació Carme Vidal human research ethics committee. Inform consent was obtained.\n1. Recruitment of the subjects\nNOTE: Recruitment was performed as per the previously published literature12.  \nRecruit children with ADHD without comorbidity. In the present study, 66 children, aged 13-15 years, mean 13.89 years with SD ± 0.8, 47 males and 19 females, were recruited. Have trained psychotherapists (qualiﬁed in psychology) or psychiatrists perform the procedure of recruitment.\nGet informed consent from the patient or the caregivers.\nPractice a discerning clinical history. As needed, perform the following studies: cardiological examination, both auditory and visual event-related potential, thyroid study, sonography, video-EEG, otorrinolaringology exploration, ophthalmological exploration, rule out both previous medication and comorbidity, as well as, any child psychiatric disorders or any other therapy in progress. Use any registered personal medical history available.\nAsk a pediatric neurologist to confirm the diagnosis using DSM-IV55 or DSM-V56. Ask a psychiatrist to rule out comorbidity.\nComplement the diagnosis using another useful criterion like parent and teacher rated Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham scale 18 (SNAP-IV-18) for ADHD symptoms (Swanson, 1995)57 as used in this protocol.\n\t\nUse the narrow band behavioral scale, like SNAP-IV, which is more specific for the diagnosis of ADHD and often correlates with the deﬁnition in DSM-V. In this study, all children met the criteria for ADHD combined type at baseline. All 66 children scored ≥ 2.5/1.8 (teacher/parents) in SNAP-IV.",
    "NOTE: SNAP-IV consists of 18 items and can be filled in by parents and teachers. The items are questions about the occurrence frequency of a series of behavioral characteristics. The answers range from zero (no or not at all), 1 (yes, a little), 2 (yes, quite a lot) to 3 (yes, a lot). A total score can be obtained by adding the values of all the items and dividing by 18. The cutoff point is different according to the response of the parents (1.78) or the teacher (2.56).\nPerform an unstructured interview of parents and teachers focused on collecting (confirming) data on behavior as mentioned in the SNAP-IV in to have sufficient information to make the diagnosis.\n\t\nUse the unstructured interview that is more informal and open-ended. There is a high probability that they will give 100% truthful answers. In the present study, each case was assessed by two blinded researchers and inter-observer agreement of 80% was required. The ADHD diagnostic interview was completed face-to-face with the child’s principal caregiver by trained research interviewers.\nUse inclusion criteria: combined ADHD according to DSM-IV55or DSM-V56 and SNAP-IV-18 or similar one. Also, use the following exclusion criteria: any child psychiatric disorders or any previous medication or any other therapy.\n2. Procedure\nCognitive assessment\n\tNOTE: This was done by administering CAS test4 which was performed as per the previously published literature12.\n\t\nMeasure the cognitive function of participants by applying the Cognitive Assessment System (CAS).\nUse a battery like CAS that assesses PASS processing of information: planning, attention, successive and simultaneous.\nRecord the raw score for each test to be transformed into a standard score according to manual instructions.",
    "NOTE: For the four PASS processing, a standard score with a normative mean of 100 was used with a standard deviation (SD) of 15. For three subtests in each of the four scales, the mean is 10 and the SD is 3.\nRepeat this assessment using again the CAS battery at month 6 after the application of the program “The Adventures of Fundi”.\nCompare the results between the score of each cognitive process at baseline and the 6-month follow-up scores.\n\t\tNOTE: The 6-month follow-up, without pharmacological intervention, allows ruling out the potential “practice effect” of two closely spaced psychological tests.\nBehavioral assessment\n\tNOTE: This was performed by administering the SNAP-IV-18\n\t\nAdminister the SNAP-IV questionnaire (Swanson, 1995)57 at baseline, that is, values against which all performances will be compared. After intervention. Record the remission versus the response in each case. Calculate the percentages of remissions and responses in the entire sample.\n\t\tNOTE: Remission is defined as a mean total score of 1 on most standardized questionnaires. On the contrary, the response has been usually deﬁned as amelioration in symptoms of at least 25% with disappearance of the malfunctioning DSM-V criteria. Therefore, remission is associated with a loss of diagnostic status and optimal functioning. Remission is optimal, but the response not so much.\nPut into practice a regular follow-up communication with the child’s caregiver (parents and teachers) to review the caregiver concerns, evaluate progress, and provide advice and support (e.g., monthly telephone calls).\nThe Adventures of Fundi - Go/No go task",
    "Show to the participant five short videos on how the brain learns before starting the game of “The Adventures of Fundi”. These videos are named “Fundi and the Brain”. In these supplementary videos, the four cognitive processes described by the PASS theory (planning, attention, simultaneous and successive) are explained through a metaphor.\n\t\tNOTE: Remember, the indirect metaphorical communication implies inductive learning and indirect communication that makes remediation less painful or more enjoyable. A knowledge is being communicated considering the emotional impact.\nExplain the objective of the game of cognitive intervention \"The Adventures of Fundi\" to the participant: “It seeks to train the brain to facilitate academic learning. Above all, it pursues the self-regulation of the student supported by the PASS cognitive process of planning.”\nHave the participant enter the page: http://www.fcarmevidal.com/aventures/ and click on the language to work with.\nProvide them with a username and a password so that the participant can start the session (e.g., login: jove / password: jove).\nClick on the first country (1-Paris).\nRead the screen and click the Continuar button. Perform this step in the same way for each of the nine screens.\nAsk the child to solve the proposed task. The first task involves clicking on the boy’s face every time it appears on the screen.\nRead the screen results and click Continuar.\nEnsure that the game provides a code that the child must remember to input in the next screen. Start the game again from the beginning if he/she does not remember the code.\nRepeat step 2.3.4 but with the next country.\nEnd the session after about 40 min.\nInform the child that he will have to figure out a way to remember the code and the country in which the session ended to continue the next day.",
    "Perform one session every week for six months.\nIntervene making use of indirect communication. If during the session, the participant makes a mistake, the game itself will indicate that he/she must repeat the task. The most important thing is that in the second attempt, the participant solves the task correctly. One example is presented below.\n\t\t\nIf the child makes a mistake, and he does not solve a task, say: “Oh! what’s happened? Do you know?” Let the child answer if he does.\nThen continue, “I think we were tricked. This happens. Maybe our hand went quicker than our brain.” Observe the child’s body language.\nIf the child nods, suggest to them to try again but using a stop signal. This signal can be visually presented or can be presented as a clue (e.g., lifting the palm of his hand).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Techniques used in indirect communication include metaphors, introductory phrases, saturation of channels of information, indirect questions, hypothetical phrases, ambiguous terms, silence, dissociation, paradox, false alternative options, melodramatic expression or confusion, prescription of the symptom, and post-trance amnesia.\nIf the therapist observes the child repeats the error and he/she is blocked, use some metaphor (Ericksonian hypnosis) to change the belief that is blocking the participant. An example is presented below.\n\t\t\nIf the blocking belief is “I am not able to do this task”, use a pacing prescription like: “Maybe, at this moment, we feel bad because we know we have failed but look, I am going to explain to you a very interesting story, do you agree?”\nIf the child nods, narrate a story to motivate them. Now, ask them to repeat the task.",
    "Intervene through indirect communication if the child solves the task using a strategy that is inappropriate and they do not modify it without help. If the metaphor can allow the participant to see other alternatives or other strategies, allow them to solve the task successfully.\nUse inductive learning and indirect communication throughout the procedure. The effect of the procedure lies in communicating knowledge (messages) without transmitting pain or discomfort, whether consciously or unconsciously. This requires interpreting body language and verbal language as a transmitter of feeling. Self-verbal report is unreliable. This experience increases self-confidence.\n\t\tNOTE: Both indirect communication (what it is) and its rationale are explained in the discussion section.\nSubscription Required.
