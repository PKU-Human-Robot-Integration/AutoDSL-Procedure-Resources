    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nImmunostaining\nTiming: 10 days\nWe recommend culturing the OTCs for three weeks to ensure their maturation and stabilization before starting experiments and immunostaining. Immunostaining of OTCs is complicated by their thickness (even if it decreases during cultivation; Guy et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]) and the glial scar caused by dissection, which severely hinders antibody penetration. While it is still possible to stain within a few microns of the surface using classical immunostaining protocols, cells located deep within the OTCs cannot be reliably stained. We aimed at localizing the expression of GluA2 containing AMPA receptors in the different spine subtypes along dendritic stretches determined by the transgenic mouse line (Tg(Thy1-EGFP)MJrs (Feng et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7])). Because GFP-expressing cells are generally localized deeper than a few microns, we optimized a staining protocol combining a short fixation with long antibody incubations that ensured reliable and consistent depth penetration of antibodies by constant permeabilization.\nNote: This protocol can also be applied to thick slices we have successfully applied it to 400 μm thick acute slices (see Bissen et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nDay 1: Fixation, blocking, and primary antibody incubation\nTiming: 4 h\nPrepare the fixative (4% PFA/1× PBS) and the blocking buffer (3% normal donkey serum + 3% normal goat serum in 1× PBST) fresh and store at 4°C until use. PBST (2% Triton X-100/1× PBS) can be prepared in advance and stored at 22°C.\nBriefly rinse the OTCs in 1× PBS by completely removing the IM and adding 1 mL 1× PBS between the edge of the well and the insert.\nFix the OTCs on ice for 5 min by completely removing the PBS and adding 1 mL of 4% PFA between the well and the insert and a few drops on top of the OTCs.",
    "Critical: Do not fix OTCs for longer than 5 min. Longer fixations can severely compromise the penetration of the antibodies and affect the visualization of cells of interest located deeper within the OTCs.\nWash 5 × 10 min in 1× PBS on a rocker at 22°C. After 2–3 washes, gently scrape the OTCs off the insert with two thin spatulas and transfer them to a 24-well plate (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1796-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Immunostaining\n(A) Fixed OTCS are best removed by carefully scraping them from the Millipore insert with a metal spatula (step 4).\n(B) The quality of immunostaining prior to expansion microscopy can be assessed by placing an OTC on a slide, drawing a closed circle around it with a PAP pencil, and carefully adding enough PBS to prevent a staining background caused by drying and to allow imaging with a water-dipping objective (step 10).\n(C) Representative image of a successful immunostaining for GFP (green) and GluA2 (red). This is a single step within a Z-stack to better visualize GluA2 staining. Scale bar: 5 μm.\nPause point: If necessary, OTCs can be stored in 1× PBS at 4°C in the dark and wrapped in parafilm until the protocol can be continued.\nCritical: Do not transfer the OTCs with a brush – they stick to the hair, and since they are very small, they are difficult to remove from the brush without being damaged.\nCritical: Be very careful when renewing the PBS after transferring the OTCs into the 24-well plate, as they are now floating freely and can easily be sucked into the pipette.",
    "Note: We use 24-well plates because our OTCs are quite small; the diameter of the wells should be adjusted to the size of the OTCs. We usually place all OTCs of one insert (up to 6) in the same well.\nIncubate with blocking buffer for 2 h at 22°C on a rocker (250 μL/well).\nIncubate with the primary antibody in blocking buffer at the appropriate concentration for 7 days at 4°C on a rocker (250 μL/well). To avoid evaporation, wrap the plate in parafilm.\nCritical: Incubation with the primary and secondary antibodies is performed in 2% Triton X-100 to allow deep antibody penetration.\nCritical: Due to the stringent permeabilization conditions, the quality and specificity of the primary antibody should be evaluated with great care. The staining protocol may need to be adjusted for each antibody to preserve the fluorescence, e.g., by increasing antibody concentration or boosting the fluorescence proteins. The antibodies used in our original study (for the AMPA receptor subunit GluA2 and for GFP) have been included in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table].\nNote: Shorter incubation times (24–72 h) may be sufficient to yield a consistent and specific staining if the cells of interest are localized at the surface of the OTCs.\nNote: We recommend including a sample that is not incubated with the primary antibody with each experiment to evaluate non-specific signals from the sample and/or the secondary antibody.\nDay 7: Secondary antibody incubation\nTiming: 20 min\nWash 3× 5 min in 1× PBS (1 mL/well) at 22°C on a rocker.\nIncubate with the secondary antibody in blocking buffer at the appropriate concentration for 3 days at 4°C in the dark (250 μL/well). Wrap the plate in parafilm to avoid evaporation.",
    "Note: Shorter incubation times (3 h at 22°C or overnight (12 h–16 h) at 4°C) may be sufficient to yield a consistent and specific staining if the cells of interest are localized at the surface of the OTCs.\nDay 10: Imaging\nTiming: ∼ 1 h (dependent on the number of samples)\nWash 3× 5 min in 1× PBS (1 mL/well).\nOptional: Counterstaining with DAPI (1 μg/mL) can be performed at this step: 30 min at 22°C (250 μL/well) followed by 3× 5 min washes in 1× PBS. DAPI can help visualize the tissue if immediate imaging is performed but it does not survive expansion microscopy.\nImage directly stained OTCs under a confocal microscope.\nNote: OTCs intended for expansion microscopy should not be mounted and can be imaged using a dry objective for low magnification and/or a water immersion objective for higher magnification pictures.\nDraw a circle with a PAP pen (the diameter should be slightly larger than the size of the OTCs) and fill it with PBS.\nTransfer one OTC in the PBS with a metal spatula (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: Optimize the imaging parameters according to the imaging setup (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].",
    "Note: We strongly recommend at this point to assess the quality of the staining before proceeding with expansion microscopy; poor staining will be worse after expansion (where fluorophores are spread over a larger area), and if imaging of the expanded samples is problematic, pre-expansion imaging will help narrow down the cause of the problems to staining or expansion. We have also found that the best way to calculate the expansion factor is to measure the distance between two landmarks in the tissue before and after expansion, and the first measurement should be taken at this stage (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). For instance, we have taken advantage of the sparse labeling of pyramidal neurons by GFP in our transgenic mouse line to use somata of readily identifiable pyramidal neurons as landmarks.\nNote: PBS evaporates rapidly under the heat of the laser. There should be enough PBS to accommodate the normally larger working distance of water immersion objectives, and fresh PBS can be carefully added directly to the OTC if needed.\nKeep the OTCs in 1× PBS (1 mL/well), wrap the plate in parafilm and aluminum foil (to protect from light), and store at 4°C until use.\nCritical: Due to the very short fixation, OTCs will not survive the permeabilization process if stored in PBS at 4°C for several months. We have performed immunostaining for up to 2 months after fixation without problems, but after a storage of 5 months in PBS OTCs disintegrated quickly upon transfer into the permeabilization solution. We thus strongly recommend proceeding with imaging and/or expansion microscopy within a few days.\nExpansion microscopy\nTiming: 3 days",
    "To analyze protein distribution at the super-resolution level, we took advantage of expansion microscopy, a recently developed technique that improves spatial resolution by physically increasing sample size (Chen et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Briefly, proteins are cross-linked with a polymer-based gel; the tissue is then digested, leaving only the anchored proteins within the gel, which is then expanded by osmosis in multiple water baths. Several variants of the initial protocol have been published, with optimizations for the model (cells, slices) and for the molecules of interest (protein or RNA), and they have been collected in a protocol paper (Asano et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). The present protocol is adapted from the Basic Protocol 2 from Asano and colleagues, with practical twists optimized for OTCs.\nNote: Since samples are stained, all steps should be protected from light.\nDay 1: Cross-linking\nTiming: 5–10 min\nThaw one Acryloyl-X SE/DMSO aliquot in the fridge. Dilute it in 1× PBS (5 samples: 10 μL in 990 μL PBS; 10 samples: 20 μL in 1980 μL PBS).\nTransfer the OTC into the microwell of MatTek dishes using spatulas or brushes (1 OTC/microwell; Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1796-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Expansion microscopy\n(A) Cross-linking: Transfer each OTC into the microwell of a MatTek dish (step 13) and add 200 μL Acryloyl-X into the microwell (step 14).\n(B) Gelation: After 2× 15 min PBS washes, add 200 μL fresh gelling solution in the microwell and let stand at 4°C for 30 min (left panel, steps 15–19); replace the old gelling solution with 150 μL fresh gelling solution, carefully place a coverslip on top and let stand at 37°C for 2 h (right panel, steps 21 and 22).",
    "(C) Post-Gelation: Gently pull off the coverslip (Option A); sometimes the coverslip sticks to the gel, in which case both should be removed from the microwell (Option B; step 23).\n(D) Digestion: Add 2 mL digestion buffer and allow the gel to stand overnight (12 h–16 h) at 22°C (left panel; steps 24 and 25). The OTCs are already expanding during the digestion: compare the left (before digestion) and right (after digestion) panels (steps 25 and 26). Note that the gel has expanded out of the microwell.\n(E) Expansion: Add ∼ 5 mL distilled or MilliQ water to the dish and let the OTC sit for ∼ 20 min; repeat until expansion reaches a plateau (in our hands, after 5–6 baths). The picture shows the same sample from D, now expanded after the fifth bath (step 28). The gel was cut around the sample to facilitate handling.\n(F) Embedding: Add viscous agarose around the sample and wait a few minutes for the agarose to gel (1st step), then add a few extra drops to the edges of the gel to prevent movements in Z (2nd step), being careful not to cover the OTC to avoid diffraction artifacts (steps 32 and 33).\nNote: Microwells in MatTek dishes provide a favorable environment for gel formation by offering a suitable substitute for the gelation chamber that must otherwise be constructed (e.g., with coverslips; see Asano et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Microwells are 700 μm deep and can thus contain any sliced tissue. The diameter of the microwell can also be adapted to the size of the tissue to avoid generating an overly large gel.\nAdd 200 μL Acryloyl-X SE/DMSO/PBS to each microwell; the resulting bubble will cover the entire microwell. Leave the samples overnight (12 h–16 h) at 22°C (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).",
    "Critical: Make sure that the OTCs are in the solution and not floating on top of it, as this would impair the anchoring of the proteins to the gel.\nCritical: Make sure that the solution remains in the microwell; even a slight spill can break the surface tension and cause loss of solution from the microwell to the rest of the dish.\nDay 2: Gelation and digestion\nTiming: 3 h 35 min\nGelation.\nTiming: 3 h 30 min\nThaw the digestion buffer and the components for the gelling solution in the fridge.\nWash the OTCs 2 × 15 min in 1× PBS.\nPrepare the gelling solution (200 μL/slice) immediately before use as it solidifies fast.\nNote: Add TEMED and APS last to prevent immediate solidification.\nRemove the PBS and carefully add the gelling solution on top of the sample within the microwell (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nIncubate in the dark for 30 min at 4°C.\nNote: This step ensures deep penetration of the gelling solution within the tissue. It is recommended for slices thicker than 100 μm, but it is not necessary for thinner slices and cell cultures.\nPrepare fresh gelling solution (150 μL/slice) immediately before use.\nCarefully aspirate the old gelling solution from the microwell and replace it with freshly prepared solution. Using forceps, carefully place a 15 μm coverslip on top of the microwell (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nCritical: This step ensures the formation of a flat, smooth gel with a thickness equal to the depth of the microwell. Make sure that the OTC is not near the top of the gelling solution or it may stick to the dry coverslip and not be properly incorporated into the gel.",
    "Note: The OTC is usually located at the bottom of the microwell and is thus closer to the bottom of the gel. This aspect is important for mounting and imaging (see below).\nIncubate for 2 h in the dark at 37°C. The gel should be completely polymerized.\nCritical: Do not wait longer than 2 h or it will start shedding water and the quality will be compromised.\nDigestion.\nTiming: 5 min\nCarefully peel off the coverslip using straight forceps and check if the gel is completely polymerized (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nNote: Coverslips should be discarded and not reused.\nAlternatives: The gel may adhere to the coverslip and detach from the microwell when pulled with forceps (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). In this case, do not detach it and place it in the dish facing downward.\nPrepare a master mix of digestion buffer and proteinase K (2 mL and 20 μL per sample, respectively) and add 2 mL immediately on top of each gel (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nIncubate overnight (12 h–16 h) in the dark at 22°C.\nDay 3: Expansion and imaging\nExpansion.\nTiming: ∼ 3 h\nRemove the digestion buffer and (if necessary) the coverslip.\nNote: At the end of the digestion, the gel has usually started to expand so that it overflows from the microwell (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nPause point: If no imaging is planned for the next few days, replace the digestion buffer with PBS and store the samples in the dark at 4°C. The gels are already starting to expand and detach from the coverslip.\nAdd ∼ 5 mL of distilled water per dish.\nNote: Immediate dehydration is not a problem, so all samples can be processed simultaneously rather than sequentially.",
    "After ∼ 20 min, renew the water bath with fresh distilled water. The gel is starting to expand, so add enough water to keep it at least completely covered. Repeat this step with fresh water until sample size does not increase anymore, i.e., when maximal expansion is reached. Store at 22°C in the dark (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E). Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: The speed and extent of the expansion depends on the dish volume, wash time, number, and volume: more washes and/or longer incubation with a higher volume of water in a larger dish will result in greater expansion. The rate of expansion is determined by several factors, such an improper digestion, and most notably the salt concentration in the liquid used for expansion (a high-salt buffer such as 1× PBS will limit expansion and the impact of digestion on expansion compared to diluted PBS or distilled water).The ratio of acrylamide to sodium acrylate also significantly impacts expansion rate (see discussions in Asano et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Truckenbrodt et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]). For OTCs, we found that optimal expansion was reached after 5–6× 20 min washes in MatTek dishes. Expansion can be assessed by measuring sample size before digestion and after every bath; in our hands, we routinely reached a 3–3.5× expansion.\nNote: Samples become transparent during expansion. Therefore, to facilitate visualization and manipulation, it is best to cut the gel around the sample with a scalpel before the first or second wash and as often as necessary thereafter. This will also facilitate handling during imaging.\nCritical: The gel should not fold or stick to the bottom of the dish to avoid anisometric expansion and cracking!",
    "Pause point: Gels can be stored in the dark in PBS at 4°C if imaging is not performed immediately afterwards. Immediate imaging is recommended to avoid loss of signal, but we have successfully imaged samples after up to three days of storage.\nMounting and imaging.\nTiming: ∼ 1 h per sample\nMelt 2% agarose in distilled water in the microwave during wash 3 or 4 and set the water bath to 35°C. Keep the agarose in the water bath all the time to prevent solidification.\nAlternatives: we describe here embedding with agarose, which can be used for imaging with an upright microscope. Alternatives include glue (for upright imaging) or fixation with poly-D-lysine (for upright or inverted imaging) (see Asano et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nRemove the agarose from the water bath; it will take a few minutes to cool. In the meantime, remove the water from the sample to be imaged and carefully transfer it to a 3 cm Petri dish.\nNote: A 3 cm Petri dish is sufficient to contain expanded OTCs, provided the excess gel was cut off during expansion. However, dish and sample size should be matched.\nBring the sample to the confocal microscope. Assess the alignment of the OTC in the gel under the epifluorescence lamp. Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCritical: Due to the gelling process, OTCs tend to be closer to one edge of the gel in Z. This step is crucial to ensure that the sample is mounted in the correct orientation in Z (i.e., on top of the gel for upright microscopes) and thus visible without the large diffraction caused by the larger portion of the gel on the other side of the sample.",
    "Note: The epifluorescence lamp also illuminates the gel, which can make it easier to find the sample. However, it is not always sufficient to make sure that the sample is on top of the gel (for upright microscopes), as the illumination field is quite large. Assessing the orientation of the sample within the gel in respect to the Z-axis with confocal lasers is therefore necessary.\nOnce alignment is confirmed and agarose is gelled, add agarose around the sample using a cut 1 mL tip and cover the entire dish to prevent horizontal movement. Make sure the sample is in the center of the dish to facilitate imaging (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F).\nWhen the agarose is nearly solidified, place a few drops on the edges of the sample to prevent movement in Z. Cover the sample with distilled water and transfer it to the microscope for imaging with a water immersion objective for high magnification images (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1796-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Imaging expanded OTCs\n(A) The expansion factor can be calculated by measuring the distance between two orientation points before (left) and after (right) expansion. Scale bar: 100 μm.\n(B) Representative pictures of dendritic stretch before (top) and after (bottom) expansion, with GFP in green. Scale bar: 5 μm. Note that the scale bar for expanded pictures corresponds to the physical size of the sample as given directly by the microscope based on the imaging parameters.\nNote: Imaging parameters should be adjusted to suit the particular setup. For reference, we used a two-channel laser-scanning confocal (Leica, TCS SP8). This is the protocol we followed:",
    "We identified our region of interest (the dentate gyrus) using a 10× air objective and switched to a 63× water-dipping objective (NA 0.9) to identify the somata of our cells of interest (granule cells). To avoid diffraction-induced loss of resolution, we selected cells within the upper half of our expanded samples (e.g., less than 200 μm deep).\nWe followed the dendritic trees of these cells until the outer molecular layer and imaged secondary dendritic stretches with a 3× zoom.\nWe rotated the selected stretch until it was horizontal and determined a rectangular region of interest fitting only this stretch to speed up imaging (1024 × 256 pixels).\nWe imaged a Z-stack encompassing the whole stretch with 0.5 μm step size, a frame averaging of 3 and using two lasers simultaneously at 488 nm (for GFP) and 561 nm (for GluA2 labeled with Alexa 568 as secondary antibody) (see Bissen et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCritical: Do not cover the sample itself with agarose as this will cause diffraction.\nCritical: Imaging should be performed as soon as possible. The heat from the laser will cause the gel to begin to deposit water and shrink, causing it to separate from the agarose. In our hands, this tended to happen around 30–45 min after mounting. The movements, although small, are sufficient to interfere with imaging. If necessary, remove the agarose and remount the gel with fresh agarose.\nAfter imaging, discard the water, remove the agarose and carefully return the sample to the original dish.\nNote: The agarose can be reused. After a few samples, the agarose stock will become almost completely solid and thus unusable; thaw it briefly in the microwave and allow it cool to 35°C.",
    "For longer storage, the sample should be stored in PBS. It will shrink back to its original size and can thus be stored in a 24- or 12-well plate. We have re-used shrunk samples for expansion and imaging for up to two weeks after initial imaging without issues."
