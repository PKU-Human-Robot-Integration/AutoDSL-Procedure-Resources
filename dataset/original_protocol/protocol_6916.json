    "DNA preparation pAID plasmid constructionNote: pAID plasmids contain the OsTIR1F74A and mScarlet-mAID expression cassette under the control of the CMV (Addgene #140615) or EF-1α promoter (Addgene #140616) (Figure 1A) (Nishimura et al., 2020). The CMV promoter is for the chicken DT40 cell line, while the EF1a promoter is for mammalian cell lines. The cDNA of the target protein can be inserted into the EcoRV site at the end of the mScarlet-mAID cassette using the InFusion (Takara) or Gibson assembly (NEB) cloning systems (Figure 2B). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4092/bioprotoc-11-14-4092-g002.jpgFigure 2.

Please see the user manual of the In-Fusion HD cloning kit for details.Perform colony PCR to collect the transformed E. coli colonies.Note: We use colony PCR to collect E. coli colonies by GoTaq (Promegega) before isolation of the corresponding plasmids. We usually check 8 colonies per sample using the following primer set: pAID-Ncheck1: 5-CAGGCGGTGGAAGCGGGTGCCG-3pAID-Ncheck2: 5-ACAAGTTAACAACAACAATTGG-3Collect two of the E. coli colonies and isolate the corresponding plasmids.Confirm the sequence of the cloned plasmid by Sanger sequencing.For the transfection step, transfection grade pure plasmid DNA is necessary. We usually use the NucleoBond Xtra Maxi kit for plasmid isolation to obtain transfection grade plasmids; we typically obtain several mg/ml plasmid solution. If the concentration of plasmid DNA is lower than 1 mg/ml, the DNA should be concentrated by ethanol precipitation.pX330 construction and design of sgRNA for target sequencesNote: We usually design sgRNA at the intron-exon boundary to avoid digesting the cDNA in the pAID plasmid (Figure 3). The pX330 plasmid was constructed as described in a previously published study (Pyzocha et al., 2014). Please see Step A9 regarding plasmid preparation. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4092/bioprotoc-11-14-4092-g003.jpgFigure 3. sgRNA design for target genes. SgRNA for gene targeting is designed at the intron-exon boundary. There are three examples for designing a target site for CRISPR/Cas9 at the CENP-A gene in chicken, mouse, or human cells. The boxed area shows the exon 1 sequence of CENP-A. The sequence shown in red is the target site for CRISPR/Cas9. The double-strand break site introduced by CRISPR/Cas9 is labeled as DSB site for CRISPR.",
    "TransfectionA single-step method enables the generation of AID-based conditional knockouts in various vertebrate cell lines. In this method, we used CRISPR/Cas9-based gene targeting combined with the integration of an AID plasmid, which contains the expression cassettes for OsTIR1 and the target protein with an AID-tag (Figure 4).Note: Although we transfected cells using polyethylenimine or the Neon transfection system, other methods (such as lipofection) can be used for the transfection of mammalian cell lines. It is important to use transfection methods with low toxicity, which will not inhibit cell growth after transfection. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4092/bioprotoc-11-14-4092-g004.jpgFigure 4. A single-step method to quickly generate an AID-based conditional knockout cell line. CRISPR/Cas9-based gene targeting is coupled to pAID-plasmid integration to express both OsTIR1 and an AID-tagged target protein. Parental cells are transfected simultaneously with three different plasmids: pAID, pX330 for pAID linearization, and pX330 for target gene disruption.After transfection, Cas9 protein induces DNA double-strand breaks in the target locus and pAID. Target genes are disrupted by pAID-plasmid integration and/or internal deletion/insertion.Co-transfection induces pAID plasmid integration into the genome and target gene disruption. OsTIR1F74A and AID-tagged target protein is expressed from the pAID plasmid that is integrated into the genome.Neon transfection of chicken DT40 cellsDNA preparation (a) Prepare 5 µg pAID plasmid, 5 µg pX330 plasmid for pAID plasmid linearization, and 10 µg pX330 plasmid containing sgRNA sequences for gene targeting. Add all plasmids to 130 µl R buffer for Neon transfection.Note: The volume of plasmid DNA solutions should not exceed 10 µl. If they exceed 10 µl, the DNA should be concentrated by ethanol precipitation.

    "Transfer 2 × 105 cells to a 15-ml tube.Centrifuge cells for 5 min at 200 × g. Resuspend the cells in 130 µl R buffer containing the plasmids.Transfect cells by electroporation using the Neon transfection system (1,400 V, 5 ms, 6 pulses).Immediately after electroporation, resuspend the cells in 10 ml pre-warmed DT40 culture medium at 38.5°C (see Recipes).Culture cells in a 10-cm dish for 48 h at 38.5°C in a CO2 incubator.Carry out single-cell cloning by limiting dilution. Take 3 ml, 0.6 ml, and 120 µl cell culture suspension and dilute each in 40 ml DT40 culture media containing 25 µg/ml Blasticidin S. Split cells into two 96-well plates (200 µl/well) and culture them in a CO2 incubator for 1-2 weeks at 38.5°C.Harvest surviving cells from each well and plate in a 24-well plate.Neon transfection of human HeLa, HeLa-S3, HT1080, and RPE1 cellsDNA preparation (a) Prepare 5 µg pAID plasmid, 5 µg pX330 plasmid for pAID plasmid linearization, and 10 µg pX330 plasmid containing sgRNA sequences for gene targeting. Add all plasmids to 130 µl R buffer for Neon transfection.Note: The volume of plasmid DNA solutions should not exceed 10 µl. If they exceed 10 µl, the DNA should be concentrated by ethanol precipitation. Cell preparation (b-i) Wash culture cells with PBS and add 1 ml Trypsin solution.

Aspirate the PBS and resuspend the cells in 130 µl R buffer containing the plasmids.Transfect cells by electroporation using the Neon transfection system (1,400 V, 20 ms, 1 pulse).",
    "Immediately after electroporation, resuspend the cells in 10 ml pre-warmed mammalian cell culture media (see Recipes).Culture cells for 48 h at 37°C in a CO2 incubator.Aspirate the media and add 10 ml fresh culture medium containing 4 µg/ml (for HeLa-S3), 8 µg/ml (for HeLa), or 10 µg/ml (for HT1080 and RPE1) Blasticidin S to the cells.Note: The effective concentration of Blasticidin S depends on the cell type. It is preferable to determine the effective concentration of Blasticidin S for each cell line. Culture cells for 1-2 weeks in a CO2 incubator at 37°C.Note: Cells sometimes grow well in a plate, which makes it difficult to isolate a single colony (cell clone). In such cases, we usually use limiting dilution to make 1:3 and 1:9 dilution cultures for every transfection. Isolate single-cell clones and transfer them into 24-well plates.Polyethylenimine transfection of mouse ES (Feeder-free E14tg2a) cellsDNA preparation (a) Prepare 1 µg pAID plasmid, 1 µg pX330 plasmid for pAID plasmid linearization, and 2 µg pX330 plasmid containing sgRNA sequences for gene targeting. Add all plasmids to a test tube containing 50 µl 20 mM glutamic acid (pH 4.0, see Recipes).Cell preparation (b-u) Add 18 µl 1 mg/ml polyethylenimine to another test tube containing 50 µl 20 mM glutamic acid (pH 4.0).Vortex both tubes.Mix and vortex the two tubes again.Incubate the DNA and polyethylenimine mixture at room temperature for 10 min.Note: During the incubation time, perform steps f-k. Wash cultured cells with PBS and add 1 ml trypsin solution.

    "Aspirate the PBS and resuspend the cells in 300 µl serum-free DMEM media.Add the DNA and polyethylenimine mixture to the cell suspension.Vortex the sample.Incubate the sample at room temperature for 30 min.Add 1 ml 0.1% gelatin solution (see Recipes) to all wells of a 6-well plate.After 5 min, aspirate the gelatin solution.Carry out single-cell cloning by limiting dilution. Plate the cells with 2 ml mouse ES medium in a gelatin-coated 6-well plate at different dilutions (for example, 1:5, 1:25, 1:125, 1:625, or higher).Culture the cells in the absence of Blastcidin S for 24 h.Aspirate the medium and add fresh mouse ES culture medium containing 10 µg/ml Blastcidin S.Culture the cells for 5-7 d in a CO2 incubator at 37°C.Isolate single-cell clones and transfer them to 24-well plates.Troubleshooting No colonies are found after blasticidin selection.Sensitivities to Blasticidin depend on cell type and species. Optimization of the concentrations of Blasticidin S for drag selection of the desired cell line is recommended.When no expression of the AID-tagged target protein is found after blasticidin selection, our recommendation is to confirm that the pAID plasmid sequence has no frameshift and/or that the pAID plasmid is stably integrated into the genome.When the AID-tagged protein expression does not compensate for disruption of the target gene, our recommendation is to fuse an AID-tag at the opposite terminus of the target protein (C-terminus or N-terminus). The AID-tag fusion occasionally inhibits target protein function."
