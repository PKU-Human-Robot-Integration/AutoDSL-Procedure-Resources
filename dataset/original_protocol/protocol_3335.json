    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIsolation of gastric mucosa\nTiming: 20 min\nThis step separates the gastric mucosa, which includes epithelium and lamina propria layers, from the underlying submucosa and deeper muscle layers. Surgical experience is recommended.\nRemove the total gastrectomy specimen from the surgical field and place the specimen on a clean back table.\nRemove the perigastric soft tissues with scissors.\nIncise the stomach along the greater curvature. Perform steps 1a-e with an assistant.\nExpose the entire gastric mucosa of the stomach and pin the stomach to a cork or wax board with the mucosal surface face-up.\nIdentify the mucosal region(s) of interest.\nNote: The mucosal area should be approximately 5 cm2.\nGently incise the mucosa with a #15 scalpel and lift the mucosa using Gerald forceps.\nCritical: Handle the tissue with care until the harvest is complete. The mucosal layer is thin and may tear easily when separating from the submucosa. Large tears or holes in the mucosa may result in having to restart the dissection.\nNote: Gerald forceps are recommended for their precise and gentle grip, which prevent slippage and tearing of the tissue.\nExtend the incision to the desired diameter at the interface of mucosal and submucosal layers.\nGently lift the mucosal layer upward and secure the remainder of the tissue flat against the working surface.\nNote: Assistance with an additional Gerald forceps is recommended when gently lifting the mucosal layer upward, see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nNote: The submucosa is white and web-like in structure and contains small blood vessels that can aid in appropriately differentiating mucosal from submucosal layers. The tiny vessels should remain with the submucosa, and thus separated from the mucosal layer. Transillumination may also help. Meticulous separation of the gastric mucosa from submucosa is imperative for a high-yield single cell suspension.",
    "Use the scalpel with the bevel facing up toward the under-surface of the mucosa to gently brush the submucosa down and simultaneously lift the mucosal layer upward.\nMass the isolated mucosa in a dry petri dish immediately using a digital pocket scale and continue procurement as needed to obtain ≥1 g of tissue.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3102-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Isolation of gastric mucosa from submucosa during tissue procurement\n(A) A hematoxylin-eosin stained slide of gastric tissue demonstrates the layers of the stomach at 200× total magnification.\n(B) Submucosa is vascular and web-like in appearance. A #15 blade scalpel is used to incise the mucosa and to separate the submucosa from the undersurface of the mucosa in gentle 2–3 mm strokes.\nNote: A small 1–2 cm diameter piece of isolated mucosa is generally sufficient to obtain 0.2–1 g of tissue. We recommend procuring approximately 1 g of isolated mucosa for this protocol.\nRecord the mass of isolated mucosa and immediately transfer isolated mucosa to MACS Tissue Storage Solution for transport on ice.\nDissociation of gastric mucosa\nTiming: 2.5 h\nIn this step, dissociate the gastric mucosa into a single cell suspension.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] This is required for downstream applications, such as scRNA-seq and flow cytometry.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]\nTransfer isolated mucosa to a petri dish with forceps.\nNote: Limit transfer of MACS® Tissue Storage Solution into petri dish.\nMince 0.2–1 g isolated mucosa with scissors or scalpel into 1–2 mm pieces, see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3102-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Minced gastric mucosa during dissociation\nProcured gastric mucosa should be minced into 1–2 mm pieces. Gastric mucosa should be kept on ice during mincing to slow molecular degradation.\nNote: Excessive mincing with surgical scissors or scalpel may induce cell death and low viability. Keep dish on ice while mincing to limit cell death.",
    "Begin Miltenyi Biotec Tumor Dissociation Kit, Human protocol as follows:\nAdd 4.7 mL 4°C DMEM, 200 μL Enzyme H, 100 μL Enzyme R, and 25 μL Enzyme A to a gentleMACS C Tube.\nAdd minced tissue to gentleMACS C Tube.\nSlide the heater onto the gentleMACS C Tube and secure to the gentleMACS Octo dissociator.\nSelect the pre-programmed protocol “37C_h_TDK_1 for soft tissue” dissociation and start run.\nFilter cell solution as follows:\nFilter cell solution through a 70 μm cell strainer into a 50 mL conical tube.\nNote: If filtering is slow due to a viscous cell solution, resuspend the cell solution in 5 mL added DMEM and centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C. This technique can be repeated at any point during experimentation to reduce viscosity. Do not use a plunger to push a viscous cell suspension through the cell strainer. Doing so may reduce the viability of the final cell product.\nWash the gentleMACS C Tube and cell strainer with 5 mL 4°C DMEM. Centrifuge cell solution at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRepeat filtering and washing steps with a 40 μm cell strainer.\nCarefully decant and pipette off media supernatant.\nResuspend pellet and wash with 8 mL 0.04% BSA in 1× PBS. Centrifuge the cell solution at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nOptional: If the cell pellet is particularly sticky and the cells will not resuspend easily as single cells, consider resuspending pellet in 2–3 mL of 1× TrypLE and gently agitate for no more than 2 min. Follow by quenching TrypLE with 20 mL 0.04% BSA in 1× PBS and centrifuging at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]",
    "Resuspend cells in 1 mL 0.04% BSA in 1× PBS and dilute 1:1 with Trypan Blue for cell counting.\nNote: If cell viability assessment is not required for downstream applications, this step may be omitted.\nNote: Complete additional washes with 0.04% BSA in 1× PBS for future applications that are sensitive to EDTA.\nNote: In this protocol we used the Nexcelom Cellometer Auto T4 Plus Cell Counter, but other models and manual counting may be used.\nEmbedding in HistoGel for immunohistochemistry staining\nTiming: 1 day + 8.5 h\nIn this step, fix and embed the dissociated cells in a solid medium. We used HistoGel Specimen Processing Gel to preserve the histologic and cytologic features of the dissociated single cell gastric mucosa prior to immunohistochemical analysis.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5],6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nFix cells optimally in 70% ethanol or 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) for 24–48 h in a 15 mL conical tube.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3102-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Embedding cells in HistoGel for immunohistochemistry staining\nThe solidified HistoGel core containing cells should be bisected into two equally sized halves and placed cut side down into a Tissue-Tek Processing/Embedding Cassette. Gentle pressure should be applied to the core to ensure that all cells are embedded into the same plane. The cassette is then closed and loaded into the Tissue-Tek VIP 6 AI Vacuum Filtration Processor for tissue processing.\nPause point: Cells can be stored indefinitely at 4°C or until trimming.\nPerform HistoGel trimming as follows:\npellet cells at 1000 × g for 5 min.\nRemove ethanol or formalin supernatant. Do not disturb cell pellet.\nAdd 1 mL preheated and liquefied HistoGel into the 15 mL conical tube containing cells.\nGently tap the bottom of the tube to dislodge cell pellet from the bottom of the tube. Ensure that the HistoGel completely surrounds the pellet before solidifying.",
    "Solidify the HistoGel by placing the tube on ice for approximately 2 min.\nRemove the HistoGel core containing cells from the 15 mL tube.\nNote: A laboratory spatula may be used to gently pry the core from the sides and bottom of the tube. Be sure not to damage the cell pellet encapsulated in the core during removal.\nPause point: Cells embedded in HistoGel may be stored indefinitely before staining.\nPlace the HistoGel core on a cutting board.\nCut the core longitudinally through the center with a razor blade, bisecting the core into two evenly sized halves.\nTrim excess HistoGel away from the core.\nNote: This should be gel that was closest to the top of the 15 mL tube, which does not contain any cells.\nPlace both trimmed halves cut side down into a pre-labeled Tissue-Tek Processing/Embedding Cassette and apply gentle pressure to ensure all cells are embedded in the same plane, see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nLoad Tissue-Tek Processing/Embedding Cassette into the Tissue-Tek VIP 6 AI Vacuum Filtration Processor and utilize the tissue processing protocol outlined below (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3102_2.csv\nImmunohistochemistry staining\nTiming: 1 day + 2 h\nIn the absence of specific signet ring cell antibodies, PAS and E-Cadherin double staining can be used to visualize suspected signet ring cells.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7],8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8],9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9],10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10],11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11],12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]\nPerform PAS staining as follows:\nDeparaffinize and hydrate slides to water.\nImmerse in 1% Periodic Acid Solution for 8 min and several times with distilled water.\nImmerse in Schiff’s Leuco-Fuchsin Solution for 10 min and wash in running tap water for 5 min.\nCounterstain in Mayer’s hematoxylin for 15 s and wash in running tap water.\nDip slide into 1% Lithium Carbonate or other suitable bluing reagent for 1–2 s and wash in running tap water for 5 min.\nDehydrate and clear in xylene.",
    "Pause point: Double staining procedure can be paused indefinitely at this step.\nPerform E-cadherin staining as follows:\nComplete antigen retrieval using 1× Antigen Unmasking Solution, Citrate-Based (Vector Labs Cat# H-3300-250) for 10 min at 100°C.\nBegin E-cadherin staining by diluting E-Cadherin primary antibody 1:400 (Cell Signaling Technologies Cat #3195, RRID: AB_2291471).\nIncubate in primary antibody for approximately 16 h at 4°C according to the manufacturer’s staining protocol www.cellsignal.com/products/primary-antibodies/e-cadherin-24e10-rabbit-mab/3195[href=http://www.cellsignal.com/products/primary-antibodies/e-cadherin-24e10-rabbit-mab/3195].\nDilute Biotinylated Goat anti-Rabbit (Vector Labs SKU BA-1000-1.5, RRID: AB_2313606) 1:100 for use in secondary antibody staining.\nMount with Permount and a cover slip."
