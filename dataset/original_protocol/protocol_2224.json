    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCell seeding on imaging coverslips (Day 1)\nTiming: 30 min\nDetach cells from a culture flask (T25 flask).\nPrepare a new T25 flask containing 4.5 mL of fresh DMEM and place it into the incubator.\nAspirate old medium with a Pasteur pipette.\nWash once with 1 mL of PBS (Ca2+ and Mg2+ free) and gently swirl to dilute remaining DMEM and cell debris.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nAdd 1 mL of Trypsin-EDTA solution to the cell culture flask and swirl to cover the cells.\nIncubate about 10 min for cells to detach from the surface and each other.\nGently shake the flask to facilitate cell detachment.\nVisually assess cell detachment using an inverted phase-contrast microscope.\nCollect the detached cells:\nOnce cells are detached, add 4 mL of cell culture medium to stop trypsin enzymatic reaction, gently pipette up and down to help cell detachment and collect all the cell suspension.\nTransfer 1:10 of the volume (0.5 mL) into the new flask and put back in the incubator for future experiments.\nTransfer the remaining volume (4.5 mL) of the old flask to a 15 mL Falcon tube;\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 60–125 g for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and gently resuspend the pellet in 3 mL of imaging medium (stock cell suspension).\nSeed cells on coverslips in imaging medium.\nCount cells with a hematocytometer or equivalent device.\nDilute stock cell suspension in imaging medium at 5 × 104 cell/mL.\nCritical: Rinse collagen-coated coverslips with PBS and then rinse again with imaging medium to remove any acid residues.\nTransfer 1.5 mL of the 5 × 104 cell/mL suspension in each well of the 2-well chambered coverslip.\nIncubate the cells at least 12 h to allow for cell attachment.",
    "Critical: When seeding cells, pipette up and down twice in the well to facilitate homogenous seeding and avoid cell aggregation at the center.\nNote: Plating cells on coverslips with imaging medium before rather than after transfection allows for minimal perturbation just before imaging as cells are ready to be imaged when transfection is over.\nNote: Cells can be transfected just after cell attachment (at least 1 h after seeding) but transfection efficiency may not be optimal.\nNote: When using other types of imaging dishes, seeding volume of the diluted stock cell suspension must be adapted such that the cell surface density is around 18.000 cells/cm2.\nCell transfection (Day 2)\nTiming: 30 min (preparation) + 4 h incubation\nEach coverslip well can be used for a different transfection. You can use two wells of a coverslip for the nesprin tension sensor (CB), two wells of another for its control (CH mutant) and two wells of a last coverslip for the FRET standards (5AA and TRAF) (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nPreparation for DNA-lipid particles formation (Quantities for 1 well, scale accordingly for more).\nPrepare a 1.5 mL tube with 100 μL FluoroBrite medium (without serum).\nPipette 1 μg DNA into this tube and vortex during 10 s.\nBriefly vortex the transfection reagent and add 2 μL to the diluted DNA. Mix immediately by vortexing for 10 s.\nIncubate 15 min at 18°C–25°C.\nMeanwhile, prepare another 1.5 mL tube with 900 μL of imaging medium.\nAdd 100 μL of the DNA/lipid particles mixture (prepared in step 4c) into the second tube. Flick the tube to homogenously distribute DNA/lipid particles.\nCell transfection.\nGently aspirate and discard the imaging medium from the well with a micropipette and filter tip.\nAdd 1 mL of the tube prepared in step 4f to the well.",
    "Incubate the cells at 37°C (5% CO2) for 4 h.\nMedium change.\nUse a micropipette and a filter tip to aspirate and discard the medium from the transfected well.\nAdd 1 mL of imaging medium to the well.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C (5% CO2) for at least 24 h (up to 48 h).\nNote: The volumes indicated above refer to cells seeded in one well of a 2-well plate. For other types of dishes, scale accordingly.\nCritical: For best results, the transfection reagent to DNA ratio must be 2:1. It is very important to follow this recommendation, otherwise the transfection efficiency may drastically decrease. Never transfect more than 1 μg DNA/mL of final volume. For example, for 2 mL (typically, one well of a 6-well plate), we use no more than 2 μg DNA.\nNote: Changing medium (step 6) is not mandatory following the manufacturer guidelines but we recommend to do it to boost the growth of transfected cells.\nLive cell imaging (Day 3)\nTiming: 1 h (depending on the number of wells)\nThis protocol is valid for imaging of any FRET construct with a blue/yellow pair and particularly suitable for mTFP1/YFP (or Venus) as in the nesprin biosensor (and control construct) and FRET standards 5AA and TRAF (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Below is its application on a Zeiss 780 laser scanning confocal microscope controlled by Zen software (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1832-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Absorption and emission spectra of the different fluorescent proteins, with microscope characteristics\nModified from FPbase (Lambert, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nPrepare the microscope (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1832-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Acquisition panel to visualize fluorescent cells\nSee text for step-by-step protocol.\nTurn on the microscope.\nAbout 1 h before imaging (minimum 30 min), set the incubation parameters to 37°C and 5% CO2.",
    "Select the 63×/1.4NA Plan-Apochromat Oil objective and appropriate immersion oil, or equivalent.\nSelect an appropriate Dichroic mirror in the excitation path, such as to excite a GFP protein (for instance FSet38 wf).\nPrepare the cells (volumes below are for 2-well coverslips of 1 mL volume each, adapt accordingly for other dishes).\nFor each well, prepare 250 μL of pre-warmed imaging medium with or without drug (depending on your application) at 4× final concentration.\nFrom each well, gently remove 250 μL using a micropipette with filter tips.\nAdd 250 μL of pre-warmed imaging medium with and/or without drug.\nAllow cells to rest for 15 min in the cell culture incubator.\nPrepare the acquisition (Locate tab, Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nSet up the imaging coverslip with cells on the microscope stage.\nAdd mineral oil on top of the imaging medium to prevent evaporation.\nVisualize fluorescent cells using epifluorescence.\nSlowly bring the cells into focus, being careful not to smash the objective into the glass bottom dish.\nVerify cells are transfected and if the construct is well expressed at the expected location (at the nuclear envelope for nesprin constructs, in the cytoplasm and nucleus for 5AA, in the cytoplasm only for TRAF).\nChoose cells with a good enough signal-to-noise ratio, avoid cells expressing too much construct.\nAcquire images (Acquisition tab, Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1832-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Acquisition panel with Imaging Settings\nSee text for step-by-step protocol.\nSelect the lambda mode and set the acquisition range from 471 nm to 562 nm with a spectral resolution of 9.0 nm on the spectral channel (ChS).\nSelect the excitation beam splitter MBS458.",
    "Set the scan parameters as you would for regular scanning confocal imaging. Typically, we use unidirectional, 2× line averaging at speed 7 for a 1024 × 1024 pixels2 frame corresponding to a real size of 135 × 135 μm2 with pixel size 0.13 × 0.13 μm2.\nCheck the 458 nm excitation laser and set the power to about 70%.\nSet pinhole and detector parameters as you would for regular scanning confocal imaging. We typically use 49.4 μm (1 Airy Unit).\nStart the acquisition.\nSave your acquisition and repeat on another field of view as you wish. Eventually, you will obtain a collection of .lsm or .czi files that contain your multichannel images.\nNote: Choose the objective with highest numerical aperture, typically 1.4 for standard objectives, to maximize resolution and signal intensity. This should also come with apochromatic correction.\nCritical: Beware of photo-bleaching before and during acquisition as it will affect FRET measurement. To do so keep epifluorescence light source and laser low enough and do not let cells exposed to excitation light for too long before acquisition.\nNote: In continuous mode to preview your sample, you can select HiLo LUT to visualize saturated pixels and background and adjust imaging parameters (laser power, scan speed, pinhole) to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio. Avoid saturation as it will bias FRET measurement.\nNote: In the present protocol, we measure FRET in end point. You can also perform manual or automated time-lapses to follow FRET, and tension changes through time. Be cautious to not photo-bleach your sample with too short time intervals and/or too long experiments.\nNote: Optionally, click on the “Positions” box and indicate the number of fields you want to image.\nImage processing and FRET analysis\nTiming: varies depending on the number of images acquired",
    "We use a custom-made Python script ‘nuclearFRET.py’ in Fiji version 2.1.0/1.53 (Rueden et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]) with the libraries LOCI and MorpholibJ v1.4.3 (Legland et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). The script with the user guide for image processing is available from the GitHub webpage https://github.com/phigirard/nuclearFRET[href=https://github.com/phigirard/nuclearFRET]. The source code is freely available under GNU General Public License v3.0. The script can generate a FRET index image of semi-automatically extracted nuclear envelopes and a list of mean FRET index per nucleus (‘Nuclei’ workflow) when applied on images of cells expressing the CB or CH constructs. Alternatively, the script generates the FRET index image of FRET standard constructs 5AA and TRAF expressed in the cytoplasm (‘Whole cell’ workflow). The script is organized in 4 tasks that follow one another. For step-by step visual guide of the protocol please refer to the Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1832-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Analysis workflow with custom script\nSee text for step-by-step protocol.\nTASK 1.\nUse File > Open… to open the script ‘nuclearFRET.py’ in Fiji and click ‘Run’ on the bottom of the script editor window (you can also go to : Run > Run in the Script Fiji menu). Then, in the dialog box that appears:\nselect the multichannel ZEISS .lsm or .czi file you wish to analyze,\nselect one of the two image analysis workflows: ‘Nuclei’ option to analyze the signal from nuclear envelope or ‘Whole cell’ option to analyze the signal from the cytoplasm,\nselect [Choose values for background subtraction] if you want to subtract the background intensity levels by inserting manually the background values in the corresponding Donor/Acceptor channel numeric fields. This option will bypass the background measurement from a ROI (Region of Interest) in the acquired images (step 17).",
    "The script opens the file and checks its dimensions. If the number of Z-slices or frames is >1 (Z or T >1) or if there is only one channel (C=1), the script will abort and warn the user. If the file contains multiple positions, select with the slider in the popup window the series you want to analyze. The script creates a folder with the name ‘[filename(without extension)]+_S+[selected series number]’ to store all the analyzed data files (images and result tables).\nThe script displays the Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) generated from the multichannel stack. In this image, use the rectangular tool to manually select a ROI that contains the fluorescent protein signal. The script then displays the mean intensity profile of this ROI through the multichannel image, which reveals the fluorescence emission spectrum of the construct.\nIn the popup, select the channels that correspond to the donor and acceptor intensity maxima based on the emission spectrum. The script applies a Gaussian filter with a radius of 2 pixels to both selected channels in order to reduce noise and assigns Not A Number (NaN) value to saturated and 0-value pixels.\nTASK 2.\nIn the image window, manually select a line ROI with the freehand line tool in the darkest area of the image. For each channel, the script measures the mean intensity value within the ROI and subtracts it from the whole image. Each background-subtracted channel is saved in the ‘analyzed data’ folder created in task 1 (‘c1’: donor, ‘c2’: acceptor image).",
    "Note: the script bypasses background measurement if you have checked [Choose values for background subtraction] in the dialog of step 13. While background is usually low or even negligible in confocal images of cells expressing reasonable levels of fluorescent protein, background subtraction is critical for unbiased FRET calculation in low expressing conditions. We thus recommend to subtract the background anyway.\nNote: from here, the script will either follow steps 18 and 19 of the ‘Whole cell’ workflow or steps 20–24 of the ‘Nuclei’ workflow.\n‘Whole cell’ workflow:\nIn the popup window, select the min and max intensity values of the pixels for which you want to display the FRET index with the threshold sliders. Press ‘OK’ to generate thresholded donor and acceptor images in which the selected pixels retain their original values, while the other pixels are set to NaN.\nThe script generates a FRET index image (in %) from the background-corrected and thresholded donor and acceptor images by applying the following formula to each non-NaN pixel:\nFRET\nindex\n(\nin\n%\n)\n \n=\n \n100\n×\nI\nF\nR\nE\nT\nI\nF\nR\nE\nT\n+\nI\nD\no\nn\no\nr\n,\nwhere IFRET and IDonor are the intensity values in the acceptor and donor channels, respectively. The script will then display:\nan image where every selected pixel displays a FRET index value in % with a ‘Fire’ color map. The resulting image is saved as ‘FRET index (%).tif’,\na single row Result Table called ‘Mean FRET index (%)’ with the area (in the unit of the original image) of the analyzed region, the mean FRET index and its standard deviation. This table is not saved.",
    "This is the end of the ‘Whole cell’ workflow, you can now repeat the Image processing and FRET analysis from TASK 1 on through the ‘Nuclei’ workflow and/or go to the expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes] section.\n‘Nuclei’ workflow:\nThe script generates a FRET index image (in %) from the background-corrected donor and acceptor images obtained in step 17 by applying the same formula as in step 19 of ‘Whole cell’ workflow. The resulting image is saved as ‘FRET index (%).tif’.\nTASK 3.\nIn the MIP image, manually point with the multi-point selection tool all nuclei. The coordinates of these markers are saved as a set of ROIs under the name ‘RoiSet_Markers.zip’. The script segments all selected regions with the Marker-controlled Watershed plugin from the MorphoLibJ library.\nIn the segmented image, select background regions to fuse with the multi-point selection tool. The function ‘Merge Label and Kill border’ of the MorphoLibJ library then merges together the selected background regions and the nucleus regions touching the border of the image. The resulting image with the ‘Jet’ color map and white background is saved as ‘LabelBordersRGB.tif’.",
    "The script then interpolates labeled nuclei in closed polygon ROIs with points spaced one pixel apart by applying a 3-point running average. Polygons with less than 10 points are discarded. The set of resulting ROIs are saved as ‘RoiSet_NucleiContour.zip’. A 3-pixels-thick band is then generated from each ROI. The set of resulting ROIs is saved as ‘RoiSet_NucleiBand.zip’. A Result Table is generated with one row per pixel within the band of each nucleus contour and the following columns: the index of the nucleus (‘IObject’), the ROI name of the nucleus given by ROI Manager (‘Iname’), the index of the pixel within the band (‘IcontourPoints’), the coordinates of this pixel (‘PointX’ and ‘PointY’) and the FRET index in % of this pixel (‘FRET index (%)’). The table is saved as ‘ContourMeasurements.csv’.\nTASK 4.\nThe script sets all pixels excluded from the 3-pixels thick nucleus contour to NaN in the FRET index image obtained in step 20 of ‘Nuclei’ workflow and displays:\nan image where the pixel values in the nucleus contour are the FRET indices in % with a ‘Fire’ color map. This image is saved as ‘FRET index Nuclei.tif’.\na Result Table called ‘Mean FRET index (%)’ with, for each nucleus, its area (in the unit of the original image), the mean and standard deviation of the FRET index (in %) and the shape descriptors (circularity, aspect ratio, roundness and solidity) of the nucleus contour. This table is saved as ‘MeanFRETMeasurements.csv’.\nNote: This script was successfully run on laptop computers (both Windows and Mac) with at least 1.80 GHz Processor and 8 GB of RAM.\nNote: The segmentation step will highly depend on the signal-to-noise ratio of the initial image and the transfection homogeneity across the cell population.",
    "Note: the script also works on .tif files provided the dimensionality is compatible (C>1, Z=1, T=1).\nNote: To assess the script, we provide raw multichannel images of MDCK cells expressing the CB and CH constructs with and without drug treatment, and the 5AA and TRAF constructs, all acquired on a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope according to the present protocol."
