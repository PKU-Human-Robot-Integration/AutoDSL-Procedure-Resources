    "Ex vivo preparationNote: Whole-brain dissection from adult fly Video of this section is available on Jove (Gu and O’Dowd, 2007). Prepare dissecting solution (see Recipe 1). The dissecting solution is best used within 4-5 h after preparation.Put fly vial on ice for ~1 min to anesthetize flies (watch carefully–it will only take a short time to slow the flies down, and too long on ice will kill them).Place a small drop (~60 μl) of dissecting solution in the lid of 35 mm Petri dish.Use a pair of fine-tip tweezers and the dominant hand to pick up an anesthetized fly by the wings or legs.With the non-dominant hand, use syringe needle to pin down thorax onto the Petri dish (NOT into the dissecting solution).Take a second syringe needle with the dominant hand and decapitate fly.Stabilize hands by resting them on microscope stage, and keep fingers close to the needle tips. With head facing up, pin down the fly’s left eye with the needle in the non-dominant hand (Needle 1). With needle in the dominant hand (Needle 2), make a vertical cut just medial to Needle 1 that extends from the rostral to caudal surface (Figure 1).Turn brain 180 degrees. Pin down the fly’s right eye with Needle 1, and again with Needle 2 make a vertical cut just medial to Needle 1 that extends from the rostral to caudal surface (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180716/20180716233859_4120.jpgFigure 1. Cutting the cuticle. Pin down each eye and cut off the outer portion. Then pin and cut away the mouthparts. The cuticle will now be open on three sides to dissecting solution.Pin down mouthparts with Needle 1 and with Needle 2, make a horizontal cut that extends the entire width of the fly head and bisects the cut edges of the eyes (Figure 1).",
    "Carefully push the cut head into drop of dissecting solution and set a timer for 5 min.Turn over the fly head so that the rostral side is on the dish. Pin down the bottom edge of the rostral cuticle, beneath the brain, with Needle 1, and use Needle 2 to open “the flap of” the caudal cuticle like a book (Figure 2A).The intact fly brain should now be exposed. Still pinning down the rostral cuticle with Needle 1, use the back side of Needle 2 to gently push the brain out of the head capsule (Figure 2B).Clean the brain by pinning down connective tissue with Needle 1 and gently pushing the brain away with Needle 2. As much connective tissue should be removed as possible (Figure 2C).Entire dissection process should take less than 10 min.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180716/20180716233951_7686.jpgFigure 2. Removing the brain from the cuticle. A. With the caudal cuticle face-up, use Needle 1 to pin down the underhanging tab of the rostral cuticle. Use the backside of Needle 2 to open the caudal cuticle like a book. B. Still pinning the inner surface of the rostral cuticle with Needle 1, use the backside of Needle 2 to push the brain out of the head cuticle. C. Clear off connective tissue to end with a clean and intact Drosophila brain. Clean brain imaged with a compound microscope with the rostral side up. Under a dissecting microscope, the brain will look milky gray with bright white connective tissue.Mounting fly brain for electrophysiologyFill recording chamber with external solution. We use a chamber and platform set that allows for solution perfusion as well as heating of the chamber (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180716/20180716234056_5779.jpgFigure 3. Recording chamber and holder. The chamber is connected to a perfusion system on either side to keep solution flowing.",
    "The chamber also contains connections to a temperature controller that allows us to heat the chamber directly to warm solution surrounding the brain. A brain holder (described in Step B4) secures the brain for recording.Transfer the brain to recording chamber using a 200 μl pipet. Note that the fly brain may get stuck on the inside of the pipet tip especially if the connective tissue was not fully cleaned off the brain.Use a needle to gently push the brain to the desired position. For most of our experiments, we position the caudal part of the brain on the chamber surface with the antennal lobes facing up. The position may be changed based on the specific need of different experiments.Stabilize the brain using a brain holder as shown in Figure 4. The brain holder is made in our lab. The frame is made with a platinum wire with dimensions of 6 mm x 6 mm. The nylon fibers are glued on to the frame with super glue and the distance between each fiber is about 0.5-1 mm to accommodate the variation in brain size (but most intervals between fibers are closer to 0.5 mm). To best stabilize the brain, the fibers should cross the brain at the junction between the optic lobes and central brain region (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180716/20180716234138_6572.jpgFigure 4. Mounting the brain. A. The brain holder is made of a bent platinum wire crossed by horizontal fibers a little less than 0.5 mm apart. B. Orient the dissected brain as shown and hold in place with platinum holder.Whole-cell RecordingOur headstage is on the right of our rig setup and we use borosilicate glass micropipettes (100 μl) that are pulled on a micropipette puller in two stages: final tip resistance of 9-10 Ω.Circulate external solution with a perfusion (peristaltic pump) system.",
    "Oxygenation of the external solution is not necessary when it is constantly perfused at low speed. No minimal speed has been established, but we generally keep the perfusion at 0.8 ml/min for our recording chamber which holds 1-1.5 ml external solution. The circulating speed may vary depending on experimental needs, for example, fast drug administration or temperature change may require more rapid perfusion. However, perfusion that is too rapid may generate electrical noise or flush the brain out of place.Fill a pipette with internal solution and load onto headstage. Apply positive pressure to keep the pipette tip free of debris.Use manipulator to bring pipette above brain and slightly to the right.Local neurons are suspended above the neuropil area of the antennal lobes. As pipette approaches LNs, cells should move away slightly from the pipette (Figure 5). For those who wish to investigate excitatory neurons, cholinergic projection neurons (PNs) are located medially on the antennal lobe. The spikelet and current amplitudes of this population can be quite small. On the dorsal lateral side of the brain, large and small ventral lateral neurons implicated in circadian rhythms and sleep have also been studied using this protocol.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180716/20180716234308_7663.jpgFigure 5. Locating local neurons. Local neurons good for recording will be suspended above, but tethered to, the neuropil of the antennal lobe, have smooth cell membranes, and move away slightly when approached. The excitatory neurons of this circuit, the projection neurons (PNs), also shown.Release pressure on cell moving away to form a giga-ohm seal. Then break into the cell to record.Note: Osmolarity is crucial to the success of patches and recordings. If cells instantly break in without forming a giga-ohm seal, the osmolarity difference is too large. If cells don’t move away from the pipette or can’t be broken into, the osmolarity difference is too small.",
    "The external solution should be 15-20 mOsm L-1 greater than the internal solution. We use a vapor pressure osmometer to approximate, but adjustments are common. A 3% dilution decreases osmolarity by about 10 mOsm L-1. We recommend keeping the internal solution in a small sealed container, such as 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes. If the internal solution in an open container, the osmolality can change drastically (20-30 mOsm L-1) in a few hours due to water evaporation."
