    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPrepare samples\nTiming: 4–5 h\n      The prepared herbal raw material powder will be extracted for active\n      ingredients. Subsequently, it will go through key steps such as\n      centrifugation, evaporation, redissolution and membrane filtration, and\n      finally become a sample ready for mass spectrometry detection.\n    \n        Weigh 1 g powder with an accuracy of more than 5% in a 50 mL plastic\n        centrifuge tube or in a 100 mL erlenmeyer flask.\n      \nNote: Lower amounts can be used as well,\n      but this is not advisable in view of the relatively higher weighing error.\n      It is recommended that there should be at least 0.1 g of powder. Here\n      steps 2–5 are used to illustrate the extraction method with the example of\n      the Chinese herb Gelsemium. Those with indole alkaloids as the main\n      active ingredients can refer to this extraction method, while others can\n      refer to the extraction methods in the relevant literature according to\n      the solubility of the main active ingredients.\n    \n        The dried powder (1 g) is extracted two times by ultrasonication with\n        80% alcohol (1:25, powder mass (1 g): extract liquid volume (25 mL)) for\n        0.5 h at 60°C. The twice-extracted solutions are combined.\n      \nNote: If the dried powder is less than 1\n      g, the use of 80% alcohol is reduced proportionally.\n    \nCritical: Ethanol is flammable and\n      should be used to avoid sources of ignition. And volatile, but also can\n      damage the skin, the experimenter should wear a mask and gloves. 80%\n      ethanol should be prepared when used, and unused sealed treatments can be\n      stored for 3–5 days.\n    \n        Centrifuge the sample and evaporate the ethanol from the\n        supernatant.20°C20°C.\n        \n            Centrifuge for 10 min at maximum speed (20,000 g for the centrifuge\n            tube) at 20.\n          \nPour the supernatant into a new centrifuge tube.",
    "volatilize the sample in chemical fume hood until no alcohol remains\n            at 20°C, which requires approximately 2 h.\n          \nCritical: If the volume of pure water\n      is too great in the ultrasonic bath, then there is a possibility of\n      tipping the Erlenmeyer flask, so control the volume of pure water added to\n      the ultrasonic bath. Alcohol is highly volatile, so open it only when\n      needed.\n    \n        Put 1 mL of the solution into a 5 mL centrifuge tube that is fastened to\n        a Thermovap Sample Concentrator. Use nitrogen gas to evaporate the\n        solution.\n      \nNote: When concentrating using liquid\n      nitrogen, the flow rate of nitrogen should be controlled slightly lower\n      than expected to prevent the liquid from splashing out. Centrifuge tube\n      specifications are optional, such as 5 mL or 10 mL. The tube is usually 3\n      to 5 times larger than the volume of the solution.\n    \n        Redissolve the sample.\n        \n            Add 1 mL of the mixture of the eluent using pipettor to the 5 mL\n            centrifuge tube.\n          \n            Close the lid and immediately vortex or dissolve in the\n            ultrasonicator for 20–30 s, number of times depending on the\n            solubility of the substance.\n          \n      (Advice: The ratio of the mixture of the eluent refers to the ratio\n      of the aqueous phase to the organic phase when compounds eluted are most\n      abundant. Because some plant alkaloids are less soluble, sonicate each\n      sample for 15–20 min at maximum frequency (40 kHz) continuously in a water\n      bath heated to 50°C–60°C when redissolving).\n    \n        Finally, use the solution that was filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane\n        filter for detection.\n      \nDetect samples\nTiming: 3–5 h\n      Prepared samples were detected using a liquid chromatography quadrupole\n      time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QqTOF/MS) to obtain raw data. After\n      the pressure line of the mass spectrometer is stabilized, solvent blanks",
    "are run. A worklist is then created in the order of sample placement so\n      that the instrument runs according to the worklist.\n    \n        Place the prepared samples in trays inside the auto sampler during the\n        analysis series at 20°C20°C.\n      \nNote: In general, it is advisable to\n      prepare 3 replicates per tissue sample to ensure reliability and accuracy\n      of the data.\n    \n        Wait until each module is ready, and equilibrate the mass spectrometer\n        to stabilize the pressure line; run two solvent blanks.\n      \nNote: The four modules on the operator\n      interface appear green when ready, including HIP Sample, Binary Pump,\n      Column Comp. and Q-TOF. Solvent blank refers to the solution in which the\n      sample is dissolved, generally the same as the eluent.\n    \nRun two samples to check the pressure line and peak condition.\nNote: The pressure line should be stable,\n      without tilt and jagged. The mass spectrum peaks are independent and\n      complete, without overlap and tailing.\n    \n        Program the injection system to operate in sequential mode.\n        \n            Create a new worklist: in the drop-down menu of Worklist,\n            choose Add Multiple Samples.\nselect the location of the sample vials in order.\n            Edit the file name, save location, and run method of each sample.\n          \nNote: Please select a suitable injection\n      starting point and sequence in the selected fields of\n      Selection Origin and Block Increment. Note that the sample\n      file name must not be repeated, otherwise an error will occur and the\n      worklist cannot be run; The insertion of one quality control sample per\n      six samples is recommended, and the quality control sample can be either\n      an experimental sample or a solution prepared from the purchased standard.\n    \nCritical: The injection needle is\n      washed with 50% (v/v) methanol/ultra-pure water between injections. When\n      handling methanol, appropriate personal protective gear and thorough",
    "ventilation must be used. Gloves, goggles, and a laboratory coat should be\n      worn, and all containers should be labeled appropriately.\n    \n        Set the system to Standby automatically after finishing running of the\n        worklist. Click Script; ensure the selection of Project is\n        MH_Acq_Sript.exe. and the selection of Script is SCP_InstrumentStandby.\n      \nRun the worklist with the built method to obtain the raw data.\nPause point: Raw data can be stored\n      for an unlimited duration until data processing is initiated.\n    \nProcess data and characterize compounds\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\n    \n      The raw mass spectrometry data were analyzed using the Qualitative Mass\n      Hunter software. A table summing and recording the matching results were\n      first obtained by matching the raw data with the established PCDL in-house\n      database. Compounds were identified using MS and MS/MS data of the\n      compounds.\n    \n        Open the Qualitative Mass Hunter software (take version B.07.00 for\n        example).\n      \n        Select File -> Open Data File to select the data to analyze.\n        The total ion chromatography (TIC) can be retrieved from the spectral\n        file.\n      \nFind Compounds by Formula -> Find by Formula ->\n        Option, in Formula Source, select Database.\n        Select specified in-house database, set the maximum tolerance of mass\n        error to 10 ppm in Formula Matching, and click the start icon.\n      \nThere will be a table summing and recording the matching results.\nExport the table.\n      (Advice: Some unnecessary columns in the table can be deleted\n      before exporting the data. In general, the columns of\n      Lab, Name, Formula, Score, Mass, m/z and RT are necessary).\n    \n        Extract the extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) of compounds in the table.\n        \nSelect Chromatograms -> Extract Chromatograms.\nIn Type, select EIC.\n            On the MS Chromatogram tab, set the MS level to MS and\n            m/z value(s) (type in your values).\n          \n            On the Advanced tab, define the single m/z expansion to a",
    "symmetric (m/z) value, and the error range of m/z is\n            set to ±10 ppm.\n          \nNote: If a compound in the table does not\n      have a completely separated peak or the peak area is too small when\n      extracting EIC, the compound should be removed from the table.\n    \n        Extract MS/MS spectra.\n        \n            Select Chromatograms -> Extract Chromatograms.\nIn Type, select TIC.\n            On the MS Chromatogram tab, set the MS level to MS/MS and m/z\n            value(s).\n          \nSelect or type your values.\nNote: Confirm the searched target\n      components by using the combination of accurate EIC and MS/MS spectra.\n      These searched results were assumed as target components only when these\n      components appeared from EIC and corresponding accurate MS/MS spectra that\n      were acquired at the same time.\n    \n        Manual confirmation based on the accurate EIC may be used to exclude\n        some repeat search results.\n      \nNote: If more than one accurate MS/MS\n      spectrum is acquired at a peak that appeared from EIC, these repeat\n      results can only be considered one compound.\n    \n        Obtain a more streamlined summary table with the elimination of\n        redundant information.\n      \n        Check whether the matching compound has a MS/MS spectra in the MS/MS\n        library.\n        \nIf so, directly determine the structure of the compound.\n            If not, determine the structure by analyzing the MS/MS fragments in\n            the raw data.\n          \nNote: If there are multiple matches\n      between the EIC and the database, they need to be determined by matching\n      the MS/MS of these compounds to the database."
