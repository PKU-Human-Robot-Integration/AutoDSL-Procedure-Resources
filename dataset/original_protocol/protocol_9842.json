    "1. Micropipette preparation: pulling glass and beveling tip\nMicropipette pulling\n\t\nTurn on the micropipette puller and select a program to enter specific parameters for earthworm microinjection.\nSet parameters to Pressure=500, Pull=75, Time=250, Heat=336, and Velocity=70. Results may vary puller to puller; therefore, experiment with parameters to achieve desired tip (size, sharpness, shape, etc.).\nBe sure to conduct a RAMP test to determine the heat value for the micropipettes before pulling them, as failure to do so could lead to burning out the trough filament or breaking the glass.\nIf the air pressure needs to be changed, press the clear button, select no (0) when asked to clear all values, and select change pressure (2). This process may vary puller-to-puller; therefore, seek the instrument manual in order to change pressure settings.\nOpen the micropipette puller lid and load a micropipette into the puller. The micropipette glass used was borosilicate glass with filament pipette: 10 cm in length, outer diameter: 1.5 mm and inner diameter: 0.86 mm.\nSlide the pipette into the V-groove from the right along the pipette slit until the end of the pipette aligns with the end of the pipette holder. To ensure the pipette can travel across the filament to the opposite side, push the pipette as far as possible while ensuring that it remains resting on the pipette slit.\nTo lock in the pipette, tighten the knob on the right side and slide the locked system along with the pipette until it reaches the other side of the puller through the filament. Finally, lock in the left side of the pipette to the puller. The pipette should be in the middle of the filament; see the manual for instructions on how to properly align the pipette.",
    "Once the pipette is loaded, close the puller, press the pull button, and wait until the pipette is pulled before removing the two resulting pipettes.\nUntighten the knobs to remove the pipettes and be careful not to clip the pipettes during removal from the slit.\nPlace the pulled micropipettes on a micropipette holder or some type of support to hold the micropipette in place and to allow easy rotation without breaking the pulled micropipettes. We have developed our own micropipette holder that can be created in a machine shop or even 3D-printed.\n\t\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\nPlace the micropipette holder under the microscope and use a camera program, or a similar software, to capture a picture of the pulled micropipettes and to record the tip diameter using 10x magnification ~1000 mm and ~50 mm from the tip.\nBefore capturing a picture, ensure the camera settings match the microscope setting (10x), in order to measure with accuracy, especially for post-imaging measurements. The 10x setting is found in the horizontal toolbar ribbon located near the top of the screen.\nTo view and capture a picture of the micropipette, select the camera on the camera software located on the top left corner and press the Snap button after focusing on the tip to get an accurate reading. The Snap button is located on the horizontal toolbar on the left-side of the page under the camera tab.",
    "Take measurements of the pulled micropipettes to determine whether the desired tip size and consistency have been achieved. Pulling up to 5 pipettes is sufficient to determine if the puller and its parameters are consistently producing the desired size. If the desired tip size has not been achieved, or if sizing continues to vary per pipette, the researcher may need to experiment with different settings until a desired tip size has been achieved, or it may be necessary to fix the filament and pipette placement, which may require the reference of the pipette puller manual.\n\t\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\nSetting up to bevel the micropipette and using the electrode impedance meter\n\t\nTo bevel the pulled micropipettes, use a micropipette beveler with an electrode impedance meter and a 40x stereo microscope.\n\t\t​NOTE: Other bevelers can be used; even in-house bevelers are successful, plus different configurations can be achieved with different microscopes to examine the beveling process, including mounting a camera onto the microscope.\nAssemble the pedestal/grinding plate with the fine plate between the two black holders.\nPlace the bottom plate with the magnets facing away from the plate.\nScrew the three parts together: (1) the upper retaining ring, (2) the grinding fine plate, and (3) the lower retaining ring (magnetic). Identify the abrasive surface of the grinding plate; for the fine plate, it is a purple color and should be facing upward so that the glass will be in contact with the quartz optical flat.",
    "Place five drops of beveler pedestal oil, or as many are needed, on the quartz optical flat of the beveling instrument and place the assembled plate on top. This oil can last all day but if the plate jerks or does not spin when it should, then the quartz optical flat may need to be re-oiled.\nSpin the plate manually a few times to spread the oil and then the instrument can be turned on.\nTo set up the impedance meter, add saline (0.9% NaCl) onto the wick, which is the reference wire, and place the wick onto the beveling plate. Soak the ribbon to make a circuit with the micropipette, and cover the plate with a thin layer of saline solution.\nAttach the lead segment to the end of the wire that is attached to the impendence meter.\nFlip the \"on\" switch on the impedance meter and leave on \"stand-by\" until ready to begin beveling. Because we are creating a big opening, set electrode impedance meter to x0.1 when ready to bevel.\nLoading the micropipette and beveling\n\t\nLoad the micropipette on the pipette clamp that is located on the manipulator and tighten the knob to hold it in place while beveling.\nThrough the back end of the micropipette, fill the entire pipette with saline, and insert the lead into the micropipette, ensuring there are no air bubbles in the micropipette. It has been noticed that the presence of air bubbles in the micropipette causes variability in measurements.\nTurn on the impendence meter by switching from \"stand-by\" to \"x0.1\". Resistance should initially be 100 MΩ and when the micropipette tip touches the saline, it should display a different reading.",
    "To bevel the correct tip opening size, before lowering the micropipette, adjust the angle to 35° on the manipulator to achieve consistent beveling. A 30° angle is also sufficient but between the two, 35° holds a lower standard deviation, thus more consistent in beveling and the tip breaks less.\nUsing the manipulator, position the micropipette tip approximately two-thirds from the center of rotation of the grinding plate.\nUsing the coarse adjustment knob, lower the micropipette close to the plate so that the micropipette tip approaches the saline solution. If no camera is available, it is important to look down the microscope to see the beveling of the tip.\nOnce the micropipette tip comes into contact with the saline, the impedance meter reading should decrease from 100 MΩ to a value in the range between 80 and 20 MΩ. This value will vary due to the pulled glass opening.\nAt this point, switch from the coarse adjustment knob to the fine adjustment knob to lower the pipette more slowly to avoid breaking the tip on the plate. It is important to monitor the impedance meter and the tip simultaneously at this stage of beveling.\nWhile beveling, observe as the tip size changes, and use lighting to help create a good vantage point while beveling.\n\t\tNOTE: The tip will become extremely shiny as beveling occurs, and the tip opening will become bigger. It is imperative to use the fine adjustment knob on the manipulator to lower or raise the micropipette at this stage. Once the micropipette has been lifted off the plate, bringing it back down to the plate can cause the tip to break.",
    "Keep lowering the tip slowly until it reaches the beveling plate and bevel slowly until a resistance of approximately 20 MΩ is reached. Mastery of this process will be a strong learning curve and it will require practice to bevel the tip consistently.\nWhen a resistance of 20 MΩ is reached, raise the micropipette from the beveler.\nRemove the lead from the micropipette and unload the micropipette from the beveler. If left on the beveler, the micropipette can either break or create a bigger opening at its tip; therefore, it is essential to monitor the meter and tip while beveling.\n\t\t​NOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\nPlace the beveled micropipette on the micropipette holder and use the 10x objective on the microscope software to measure the tip opening size. A sample size of 10 tips is adequate to check for consistency in all beveled tips.\nConfirm the microscope setting (10x) matches the camera settings before taking a picture. Outliers may be thrown out after tip opening measurements.\nTo turn off the beveler, turn the switch to \"off\" on both the driving belt motor and the impedance meter.\nUnscrew the pedestal/grinding plate to remove the upper retaining ring. Do not lift the pedestal/grinding plate while they are attached to one another because it can break due to a vacuum created.\nAfter lifting the upper retaining ring of the attachment with the screws, slide the fine grinding plate off, and lift the last magnetic attachment in order to remove it. Remove the excess oil on the quartz optical flat with laboratory wipes.",
    "Clean all three components with deionized (DI) water and patted dry to avoid salt crystal formation. After long periods of use, the rotating magnetic base may experience jerking. If this occurs, squirt a small amount of DI water on the drive belt to remove any crystalized salt.\nWipe off the excess oil on the back of the grinding plate as well as on the quartz optical flat.\nUse DI water on the beveler platform to remove any excess saline that may be on the instrument to avoid crystallization.\nUse DI water to wash the beveled tips. If the tips are not washed, they will crystallize but can easily be washed off with DI water later.\nLay clay inside a plate and use the cover glass to prevent the micropipettes from contamination.\nMake indentations in the clay to hold the micropipettes. When ready to be used, the beveled tips are now ready to be backfilled with a compound of interest and injected into the vasculature of the earthworm. For this protocol example, contrast agents, microbubbles, were used as the compound of interest.\n\t\t​NOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\n2. Microinjector calibration with beveled tips\nPrepare a hydrophobic coated plate.\n\t\nThe day before, coat two plates with hydrophobic coating on the surface to cure overnight. This chemical should be from store-bought materials or from in-house lab materials, if available, and at least 12 hours for curing is needed.\nCoating is a quick two-step process. Spray with the Base Coat and then spray with the Top Coat.\nIn a hood, or in an open space, spray the Base Coat onto the plate after vigorously shaking the Base Coat can once the mixing balls have rattled for one minute.",
    "Spray the plate with the Base Coat approximately 6-12 inches from the surface by doing passes while coating the plate. The passes consist of light passes right to left and then up and down. Keep shaking as the plate is coated and make sure not to over-spray as it will decrease product performance.\nWait 1-2 minutes before applying another coating of the Base Coat. Though it is not necessary, the additional coating can be applied if desired.\nWait 30 minutes for the Base Coat to dry.\nRepeat Steps 2.1.3 - 2.1.5 for the Top Coat.\nOnce the plate has cured overnight or for at least 12 hours, the plate is ready to be filled with mineral oil. Fill the plate approximately half-way with mineral oil.\nPlace the plate with mineral oil onto the microinjector stage.\nLoad the beveled tips on the microinjector.\n\t\nConnect the microinjector directly to a laboratory compressed air jet. A compressed nitrogen cylinder and a pressure regulator can be used for this system, but note that other microinjector systems could require a different interface.\nOpen the compressed air and open the low-pressure air-line regulator to 70 PSI and turn on the microinjector. Do not exceed 80 PSI, as the system cannot handle over 80 PSI.\nBackfill the tips with water using a 1 mL syringe with a Metal Hub Needle. If the inner diameter of the pipette is different, then a different gauge metal needle will be needed to accommodate it.\nOnce backfilled with water, load the micropipette onto the needle holder of the joystick micromanipulator. Different microinjectors and micromanipulators can be used.\nCreate water bubbles to calibrate dispensing volume through beveled micropipette.\n\t​NOTE: Before any compound administration is introduced into the vasculature of the earthworm, the microinjector must be calibrated to determine proper volume injection.",
    "Set the parameters on the microinjector for pressure at 4 PSI and time at 0.5 seconds. Exceeding these parameters will distort the size of the vessel, which is unfavorable, unless the goal of the researcher is to study vessel expansion.\nLower the pipette tip until it is close to the bottom of the plate but be careful not to break the tip at the bottom of the plate. The lower the tip is in the mineral oil, the more viscous it will be on the tip, which could lead to breakage.\nStart at an edge of the plate to make complete use of the plate during calibration.\nOnce this is in position, press the pedal to dispense a water bubble in the oil.\nThe bubble may remain stuck to the tip. To remedy this, quickly pull the plate away in the opposite direction from the bubble to separate it from the pipette tip.\nUsing the camera software, measure the bubble size and calculate the volume. If no camera software is available, alternative software can be used.\nCreate 10 bubbles and measure the average bubble diameter to determine the correct volume the micropipette will dispense into the earthworm vasculature.\n\t\t​NOTE: If the researcher is interested in dispensing a variety of volumes, the parameters for pressure and time can be manipulated; repeat steps 2.3.1 - 2.3.7.\n3. Earthworm surgery preparation to expose specific earthworm vasculature of interest\nEarthworm preparation and measurements\n\t\nPrepare 10% ethanol solution that will anesthetize the earthworms prior to the surgery.\nKeep earthworms in a 100 mL beaker with soil in between experiments.\nKeep only 5 - 10 earthworms at a time in the beaker to prevent the earthworms from drying up due to the abrupt changes from the refrigerator to the benchtop, 4 °C to 25 °C.",
    "Place the earthworms in 10% ethanol for 30 minutes. If the earthworm is still moving after 30 minutes, leave it in the ethanol solution for an additional 5 minutes.\n\t\t​NOTE: Sometimes the earthworm needs more time due to its size; therefore, time in ethanol may need to be adjusted in accordance with earthworm size, but not to exceed over an hour. Over an hour will harm the earthworm.\nRinse the earthworm under the faucet water to remove the slime it produces and ethanol.\nPlace the earthworm on a paper towel to remove excess water.\nOnce the earthworm is anesthetized, record each earthworm's weight (g), width (mm), length (mm), and vessel width (µm). Take the weight and dimensions of the earthworm before any incisions are made and without stretching the earthworm.\nOnce the vessel is surgically exposed under a microscope, use the camera software to measure the width of the vessel. If no camera software is available, a stainless micro-ruler would suffice, though it is not as accurate as a digital software measurement.\n\t\tNOTE: Depending on the vessel of interest, skip to Step 3.2 (ventral vessel), 3.3 (dorsal vessel), 3.4 (top view of hearts), or 3.5 (side view of hearts).\nExposing the earthworm vasculature, the ventral vessel (method 1)\n\t\nUse a rubber pad during the surgical procedure to pin the earthworm down thus exposing the vessel of interest to the researcher. The dark part of the skin should be facing down.\nTo surgically open the earthworm, place it on its dorsal side, the darker part of the earthworm, where a small side-incision is made on the skin of about 1 mm with a blade. This small incision allows for the surgical scissors to enter to create a long incision.",
    "Pin the earthworm skin 33 mm apart, making a 27 mm opening to expose the vessel, only using four pins to properly expose the vessel. Pins can be added or moved, once the earthworm has been pinned, to help manipulate the skin of the earthworm.\nWith surgical scissors, make an incision to reach the other pin on the side of its body. By pushing up toward the skin, it prevents any damage to the inside of the earthworm, such as cutting the vasculature or gut.\nOnce the incision has been made, pin or re-pin where the first incision was made and then at the end of the cut.\nUsing both surgical tools (surgical grips), move the skin to expose the inside of the earthworm.\nPin down the skin on the bottom as the skin is moved over, and while moving up the earthworm, continue separating the skin from the organs carefully. Once at the top, place the last pin.\nIf the vessel is not exposed, tug on opposite sides of the earthworm's skin to separate the elastic tissue of the earthworm to expose the ventral vessel and further separate the skin.\n\t\tNOTE: This tug will remove some of the tissue that is holding the organs inside the earthworm. Be careful with this step, as it may unintentionally rupture the vessels of the earthworm. The ventral vessel should now be exposed, and the nerve cord can function as a marker of the vessel, because the nerve cord runs along the skin right next to and parallel to the ventral vessel. If the ventral vessel is close to the gut, a tug on the skin can further expose the vessel. If not, push the gut to the side, but this may cause a messy working area.",
    "Exposing the earthworm vasculature, the dorsal vessel (method 2)\n\t​NOTE: Steps to expose the dorsal vessel are similar as ventral vessel exposure.\n\t\nRepeat steps 3.2.1 - 3.2.3 of Step 3.2. The dark part of the skin should be facing upward for these steps.\nUse surgical scissors to cut toward the middle of the earthworm to the opposite side.\nFrom the middle of the earthworm, make an incision toward the anterior portion of the earthworm, the head. Pushing upward toward the skin prevents any damage to the inside of the earthworm, such as cutting the vessel or gut.\nOnce the diagonal cut has been made, pin or re-pin the site of the first incision and then at the end of the cut that was made.\nRepeat Steps 3.2.6 - 3.2.9 in Step 3.2.\n\t\t​NOTE: The dorsal vessel should now be exposed.\nExposing the earthworm vasculature, top view of the hearts (method 3)\n\t\nUse a rubber pad during the surgical procedure to pin the earthworm down, thus exposing the vessel of interest to the researcher.\nTo surgically expose the earthworm, place it on its ventral side, the light part of the earthworm. The dark part of the skin should be facing upward.\nUse four pins to hold down the skin of the earthworm and to create a window to expose the hearts of interest. An additional pin, for a total of five, can be used to hold down the earthworm near the tip of its head, the anterior end.\nBegin pinning the earthworm from bottom to top, starting on the right side and then moving to the left side. Pin the earthworm, placing two pins on the top near the tip of the head, the anterior end, and two near the clitellum.",
    "Use a blade to make a small incision of about 1 mm is made on the side of the earthworm.\nUse a surgical scissor to cut toward the middle of the earthworm to the opposite side.\nFrom the middle of the earthworm, make a cut toward the front of the earthworm until reaching the mouth of the earthworm, the anterior end.\n\t\t​NOTE: It is important that the scissors are lifted against the skin to avoid cutting the vasculature; the scissor blade is visible as you go through the skin. Make sure the cut is made to the anterior end of the earthworm as this will provide better visibility of the hearts.\nOnce pinned, re-pin the earthworm, if the skin is curling into the earthworm.\nMake a tug to properly separate the tissue of the earthworm to properly expose the hearts.\nIf hearts are not exposed, move the white seminal vesicles around, as the hearts at times hide underneath these vesicles.\n\t\t​NOTE: Heart exposure may vary earthworm-to-earthworm, all 10 hearts may be visible or only half and so on. At this point, the researcher must determine whether to move organs and tissue in order to locate the hearts of the earthworm.\nExposing the earthworm vasculature, side view of the hearts (method 4)\n\t\nUse a rubber pad during the surgical procedure to pin the earthworm down, thus exposing the vessel of interest to the researcher.\nTo surgically expose the earthworm, place it on its side. Since the earthworm is on its side, both the light and dark side of the earthworm should be visible.\nRepeat steps 3.4.3 - 3.4.9 from Step 3.4.\nIf hearts are not exposed, move the white seminal vesicles around, as the hearts at times hide underneath these vesicles.",
    "​NOTE: Heart exposure may vary earthworm-to-earthworm, all five hearts may be visible or less. At this point, the researcher must determine whether to move organs and tissue in order to locate the hearts of the earthworm.\n4. Compound Administration into Earthworm Vasculature\nPreparing the earthworm for compound administration\n\tNOTE: For these specific steps, we injected contrast agents, microbubbles, into the earthworm vasculature as the compound of interest.\n\t\nBefore microinjection, place the earthworm on the microinjection stage, and use a lab wipe to remove any fluids around the vessel of interest, thus exposing the vasculature for injection.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not apply strong pressure because it will cause bleeding of the vessel.\nAlign the vasculature of interest to the micropipette, as it is important that the ventral vessel be aligned for injection. If the hearts are of interest, they must be perpendicular to the micropipette.\nFocus the microscope on the vasculature of interest and begin lowering the micropipette to the vasculature. Before moving any of the joystick manipulators, confirm they are all set to 0 mm to ensure best mobility.\nWhen the tip of the micropipette is in contact with the earthworm vessel, ensure that the angle between the vessel and the micropipette is less than 15°.\nOnce the micropipette begins to apply pressure on the vessel, the blood will move away from the tip due to the pressure on the vasculature. This is a good indication of proper injection placement.\nTo ensure successful injection, use the joystick to move the micropipette forward to make contact with the vasculature.",
    "​NOTE: It is important to not puncture the vessel. Take notice that the tip should be moving the vasculature, for the dorsal and ventral vessel, in the direction that the micropipette is moving, and then the coarse dial should be used to move the micropipette tip forward to allow full penetration into the vessel. If the plate is moveable, this can be used to move and pierce the vessel into the micropipette instead of using the microcontrollers or all simultaneously. The vessel will not be penetrated immediately, but a recoil of the vessel is an indicator of proper penetration of the micropipette. Once the tip has penetrated the vessel, the vessel should be straight and aligned with the micropipette. If it is not, then retract the micropipette slowly using the fine control.\nPress the pedal to inject the vasculature of the earthworm. Dilution of the blood is another indicator of proper penetration once the pedal is pressed.\nRetract the micropipette slowly and pull the micropipette away.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, breaking the tip while the micropipette is still in the vessel is an effective method to avoid blood loss.\nSubscription Required.
