    "Seeding of cellsNote: Work in a tissue culture hood to prevent contaminations. Culture all HEK-293T wild-type and TARDBP knock-out cells in DMEM high-glucose plus supplements (see Materials). Harvest HEK-293T wild-type and TARDBP knock-out cells by trypsinization and determine cell numbers using the Scepter (or equivalent manual/automatic cell counters).For setup and calibration of the flow cytometer, seed four wells of a standard six-well tissue culture plate with 400,000 HEK-293T wild-type cells each (compensation samples).For positive and negative controls, seed another four wells of a standard six-well tissue culture plate with 400,000 HEK-293T TARDBP knock-out cells each (control samples).For each TDP43 variant to be tested, seed two wells of a standard six-well tissue culture plate with 400,000 HEK-293T TARDBP knock-out cells each (experimental samples).Let the cells adhere overnight in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Transfection of cellsGeneral workflow: Work in a tissue culture hood to prevent contaminations. Per transfection, carefully add 3 µl of X-tremeGENE9 transfection to 250 µl OptiMEM without touching the walls of the microtube and incubate for 20 minutes at room temperature. Per transfection, mix 1 µg of reporter plasmid with 250 µl OptiMEM in a separate microtube. After incubation, combine the reactions and carefully spread the mix dropwise across the cells in a given well. To prepare the compensation samples, transfect one well of HEK-293T cells with 1 µg of either BFP, GFP or mCherry mammalian expression constructs. Note that one well will purposely remain untransfected.To prepare control samples, transfect two wells of HEK-293T TARDBP knock-out cells with 1 µg each of either pHBS1501 or pHBS1503.To prepare experimental samples, transfect two wells of HEK-293T TARDBP knock-out cells with 1 µg each of the desired construct. A reference collection of TDP43 CTD mutants in the splicing reporter background is available at https://www.addgene.org/Rajat_Rohatgi/[href=https://www.addgene.org/Rajat_Rohatgi/].",
    "Incubate all samples for 24 h in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Flow cytometer setup and calibrationNote: Only a basic outline of the SH800S setup and calibration procedure is given below. Please consult the manual or contact the technical service for further questions and troubleshooting. Before starting the flow cytometer, check the sheath fluid and ddH2O levels (refill if necessary) and empty the waste.Make sure that the sheath fluid container and lines are sealed, then turn on the compressor.Turn on the SH800S flow cytometer and start the operating software.Follow the prompts during the chip loading and fluidics check steps. We use 100 µm chips for analyzing HEK-293T cells. Select the 405 nm, 488 nm and 561 nm lasers when prompted.Follow the prompts during the chip alignment step. Sort calibration is not required, as analyzer mode is sufficient.During setup, harvest the four compensation samples by trypsinization. Make sure to keep the sample volumes low to prevent unnecessary dilution of the cell suspensions (we typically use 250 µl trypsin per well and quench by adding 250 µl complete DMEM). Filter each sample through a cell strainer into a 5 ml round-bottom polystyrene tube. Keep tubes on ice until further use.Once setup is finished, create a new experiment in the operating software. In the measurement settings pane, select only the FSC (forward scatter), BSC (side scatter), FL1 (BFP), FL2 (GFP) and FL3 (mCherry) channels. When prompted, start the compensation wizard and follow the steps. The compensation samples will be needed at this point.Upon completion of the compensation step, setup is finished and the remaining samples can be prepared.Prepare and analyze samples by flow cytometryHarvest the control and experimental samples by trypsinization as described in Step C6.",
    "Filter each sample through a cell strainer into a 5 ml round-bottom polystyrene tube. Keep samples on ice until further use.Start by analyzing the control samples to set the gates and get an idea of the expected effect sizes.In the BSC-A vs. FSC-A density plot, ensure that the gate for the cell population set during compensation still applies (Gate 1; Figure 2A).In Gate 1, create a FSC-H vs. FSC-A density plot to further gate for single cells (Gate 2; Figure 2B). This filter makes use of disproportions between the area and height of cell clumps compared to single cells (Hazen et al., 2018).In Gate 2, create FL1-A (BFP), FL2-A (GFP) and FL3-A (mCherry) histogram plots. The BFP signal is proportional to the total TDP43 amount. The GFP signal scales with total splicing reporter transcript levels, whereas the mCherry signal reflects TDP43 splicing activity.To get a preview of TDP43 splicing efficiency, first gate for BFP-positive cells in the FL1-A histogram (Gate 3; Figure 2C). This step is to select for successfully transfected cells only. The transfection efficiency (i.e., fraction of BFP-positive cells) should be 50% or greater. Then in Gate 3, create a FL2-A (GFP) vs. FL3-A (mCherry) density plot. There should be a significant difference in the position of the positive and negative control populations in this plot (Figure 2D). Note: These gates are only for data preview, but not final data analysis. Collect at least 50,000 events in Gate 3 for each control and experimental sample. Make sure to hit the ‘Record’ button to ensure that data is saved during data collection. As a reference, we recommend to take a screen shot of the above specified plots for each sample after data collection. Unfortunately, this has to be done manually for each sample.",

Paste the picture into a simple image processor such as Microsoft Paint and save.After all samples have been analyzed, export the data as an fcs-file by right-clicking on the experiment in the ‘Active Experiments’ panel.Shut-down the flow cytometer and software following the instructions of the shutdown wizard, which can be found in the ‘Cytometer’ tab.After the instrument shut-down, turn-off the compressor and release the pressure from the sheath tank.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200411/20200411104908_2772.jpgFigure 2.
