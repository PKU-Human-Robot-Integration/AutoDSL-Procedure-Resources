    "Thawing and recovering human iPSCs or human ESCs (hiPSCs/hESCs) (6-well plate format)Pre-warm a required volume of TeSR-E8 medium to room temperature in a 50 ml Falcon tube (see Note 1). Prepare an appropriate quantity of Vitronectin XF coated 6-well plates at least 1 h before cell thawing (see Recipes).Remove the cryogenic vial of frozen hiPSCs/hESCs from liquid nitrogen quickly and immerse the vial into a 37 °C water bath. Hold the cap to constantly swirl cryogenic vial without submerging the cap. When most cells are thawed/only a few ice crystals remain, take the cryogenic vial out of the water bath, spray the cryogenic vial with 70% ethanol and move the vial into biosafety culture cabinet. Open the cap, and then gently transfer the cell suspension into a 15 ml Falcon tube containing TeSR-E8 medium prepared before (see Note 2).Rinse the cryogenic vial with 1 ml TeSR-E8 medium and add the solution into the same Falcon tube, gently mix cells by pipetting.Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature, and then discard the supernatant.Resuspend the hiPSC/hESC pellets with 2 ml TeSR-E8 medium by gently pipetting up and down several times. Add 20 μl ROCK inhibitor (100x, stock solution) to the cell suspension for increasing survival of hPSCs (see Note 3).Discard the excess Vitronectin XF from the pre-coated 6-well plate, and slowly transfer hiPSC/hESCs suspension into the plate. One cryogenic vial of hiPSC/hESC can be plated into 1-2 wells of the 6-well plate.Gently move the culture plate back and forth, left and right motions several times to disperse cells across the whole well (see Note 4).Place the plate in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator and culture overnight.The next day, replace the medium with fresh TeSR-E8 medium without Rock inhibitor Y-27632.",
    "After that, feed cells daily with 2 ml TeSR-E8 medium per well in the 6-well plate, the hiPSCs/hESCs are allowed to grow for 4-5 days. When cells reach 70%-80% confluence, they can be passaged (see Note 5).Passage hiPSCs and hESCs using ReLeSR (6-well plate format)Generally, hiPSCs and hESCs can grow as colonies when plated on Vitronectin XF, with typical undifferentiated, dense and compact morphology and a high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio (Figure 1B, Day -2). Ideally, hiPSCs and hESCs can be passaged every 4-5 days (70%-80% confluence) as either single cell or cell aggregates. We routinely use ReLeSR for maintenance of hiPSCs and hESCs as cell aggregates (see Note 6).The following steps are for passaging hiPSCs/hESCs from wells of the 6-well plate in TeSR-E8 medium and Vitronectin XF systems. If using other culture vessels, adjust volumes of reagents according to surface area (see Table 1). Table 1. Recommended volume of related reagents for different culture vesselsimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181112/20181112184003_7510.jpgPrior to starting, coat new 6-well plates with Vitronectin XF at least 1 h and pre-warm the required volume of TeSR-E8 medium to room temperature. Remove the spent medium from the wells and wash cells once with 2 ml DPBS w/o Ca2+ and Mg2+. No need to remove differentiated regions of hiPSCs/hESCs.Remove DPBS w/o Ca2+ and Mg2+, and then add 1 ml ReLeSR into each well of 6-well plate. Swirl the plate to distribute ReLeSR over the entire cell surface, and then aspirate ReLeSR within 1 min. Incubate hiPSCs/hESCs for 5 min at room temperature (see Note 7), and check cell dissociation under the inverted phase-contrast microscope. When hiPSCs/hESCs start to separate and round up at the edge, they are ready to be removed from the wells, and then add 1 ml TeSR-E8 medium to each well of the 6-well plate.",
    "Disperse the big colonies into small clumps by gently pipetting the mixtures up and down 5-6 times. Collect all cell aggregates into a 15 ml tube (see Note 8).Rinse the well with another 1 ml TeSR-E8 medium and transfer into the same 15 ml tube.Remove the residual Vitronectin XF solution from the pre-coated plate. And evenly split the cell aggregates at the desired density into the plate. We usually split the hiPSCs/hESCs at the ratio of 1:6 (see Note 9). Supplement an appropriate volume of TeSR-E8 medium to each well, so that each well can contain 2 ml TeSR-E8 medium finally. Add 20 μl of Rock inhibitor Y-27632 (100x, working concentration 10 μM) into the culture system to increase survival of hiPSCs/hESCs. Gently move the plate in several times quick, back and forth, side to side motions to uniformly distribute the cell aggregates across the surface of the plate, and then return the plate into the 37 °C incubator (see Note 10). Refresh the TeSR-E8 medium daily and visualize cultures to monitor growth condition until the next passaging or banking (see Note 11). Derive MSCs from hiPSCs and hESCs with a single step medium switch We use a simple and efficient protocol to differentiate hiPSCs and hESCs into MSCs in feeder-free culture system. The timetable diagram of this differentiation procedure is shown in Figure 1A.Day -2: hiPSCs and hESCs preparation in 6-well plateBefore hiPSCs/hESCs differentiation into MSCs, hiPSCs/hESCs were plated as clumps into Vitronectin XF coated 6-well plates by ReLeSR treatment in TeSR-E8 medium (Figure 1B, Day -2).Pre-warm the TeSR-E8 medium. Meanwhile, prepare Vitronectin XF-coated 6-well plate as before.Seed cell clumps of hiPSCs/hESCs into Vitronectin XF-coated 6-well plate at the desired density as Steps B2-B11 in the Procedure B.",
    "Culture the cells overnight at 37 °C to maximally make cells to attach wells.Day -1: Fresh TeSR-E8 medium renewalCheck cell growth condition under microscope to ensure that the majority of passaged hiPSC/hESC aggregate attach onto new wells and start to proliferate. Remove spent medium and feed cells with 2 ml fresh TeSR-E8 medium in 6-well plates, and continue to incubate cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2.Monitor the cell growth until hiPSCs/hESCs become at least 40%-50% confluent for MSC differentiation. Day 0: MSC low-glucose medium switchThe hiPSCs/hESCs should normally reach at least 40%-50% confluence before initiating differentiation (see Note 12). The hiPSC/hESC colonies display typical compact morphology with clear border, composed of tightly packed cells (Figure 1B, Day 0). Pre-warm MSC low glucose medium in a 37 °C water bath. When the passaged hiPSCs/hESCs reach the desired confluence in the 6-well plate, gently remove the spent TeSR-E8 medium, and then wash the hiPSC/hESC colonies twice each with 2 ml MSC low glucose medium. Aspirate the spent MSC low glucose medium thoroughly, add 2 ml fresh MSC low glucose medium into hiPSCs/hESCs for each well of the 6-well plate. Thereafter, refresh MSC low glucose medium every other day. Days 2-13: Fresh MSC low glucose medium renewalIn first 2 days after MSC low glucose medium treatment, many cells die due to the culture pressure from differentiation in MSC low glucose medium. Feed cells with fresh MSC low glucose medium every other day. Gently aspirate the spent MSC low glucose medium and dead cells. Wash the differentiated cells twice with DPBS w/o Ca2+ and Mg2+, add 2 ml fresh MSC low glucose medium into culture wells and continue to culture cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2 (see Note 13).",
    "Observe cells under microscope to check cell morphology changes and record the photos (see Note 14) (Figure 1B, Day 7).Day 14: Plating heterogeneous cell derivations onto 0.1% gelatin-coated T25 flask At this time point, the cell derivations are confluent, however with heterogeneous cell populations (Figure 1B, Day 14). The cell derivations can be passaged onto 0.1% gelatin-coated flasks. Pre-warm 0.05% trypsin-EDTA and MSC low glucose medium to room temperature, and pre-coat the T25 flask with 0.1% gelatin in a 37 °C incubator.Aspirate the spent MSC low glucose medium from the 6-well plates.Wash the cells once with 1 ml DPBS w/o Ca2+ and Mg2+, and then discard. Add 1 ml 0.05% trypsin-EDTA to wells of the 6-well plate. Swirl plate to ensure that the trypsin solution completely covers the entire cell surface. Incubate the cell derivations at 37 °C for 5 min (see Note 15). Gently tap plate to dislodge cells if necessary.Add 2 ml MSC low glucose medium into the well for neutralizing trypsinization. And then pipette cells up and down several times (normally 8-10 times) to disassociate cell derivations into single cells. Collect the cell suspension into a 15 ml Falcon tube, wash the culture wells with an additional 2 ml MSC low glucose medium, and pool all the cell suspension into the same 15 ml Falcon tube. Centrifuge the cell suspension at 300 x g for 5 min, and then discard supernatant. Break the cell pellets by finger tapping, and then resuspend the cell pellets gently with 3 ml MSC low glucose medium to make a single cell suspension. Plate all the cell suspension into the 0.1% gelatin-coated T25 flask previously prepared. Supplement additional medium into the T25 flask, ensure the T25 flask can contain at least 5 ml medium.",
    "Culture the cells in the 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator and refresh MSC low glucose medium every other day until the cells become 80% confluent. Days 15-20: Fresh MSC low glucose medium renewalAt the first 2 days after plating cell derivations into the 0.1% gelatin-coated flask, not all cells can attach flasks. The attached cells are the expected cells we require. In 5-7 days, the attached cells can become confluent in the T25 flask. The MSC low glucose medium is renewed every other day. Days 21-29: Enrich hiPSC-MSCs and hESC-MSCs by serial trypsinization (8 days)When the differentiated cells in the T25 flask reach 80%-90% confluence, they can be split into new T25 flasks. The most of cells present fibroblast-like morphology (spindle-shape) (Figure 1B, Day 21). Prepare 0.1% gelatin-coated T25 flasks, warm MSC low glucose medium and 0.05% trypsin-EDTA as before.Harvest cell pellets as in the Steps C5b-C5h. Finger tapping to break the cell pellets, and resuspend the cells in 4 ml MSC low glucose medium to make a single cell suspension. Count the total cell number using a hemocytometer and adjust the density of cells to 2.5 x 105 cells/ml using the MSC low glucose medium.Seed the cells into new 0.1% gelatin-coated T25 flasks at a cell density of 1 x 104 cell/cm2 (i.e., 2.5 x 105 cells in T25 flask) (see Note 16). Meanwhile, we designate this generation of cells as passage 0 (P0) at this point, and name the cells as hiPSC-MSCs/hESC-MSCs.Supplement additional MSC low glucose medium into the T25 flasks, ensure the T25 flasks contain 5 ml MSC low glucose medium. Thereafter, replace the MSC low glucose medium every other day.Consecutively passage the hiPSC-MSCs/hESC-MSCs by trypsinization when they are 80%-90% confluent (normally within 4-5 days).",
    "The derived MSCs can gradually become mature population with 2 more times passages. Designate the corresponding generations as P1, P2. (Figure 1B, MSC, P2). Large expand these hiPSC-MSCs/hESC-MSCs for banking, characterizations and later experiments. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181112/20181112183848_5464.jpgFigure 1.

Scale bars: 100 μm. Cryopreserving hiPSC-MSCs and hESC-MSCsAfter serial trypsinization, the hiPSC-MSCs/hESC-MSCs can become more mature. Therefore they can be cryopreserved after passage 2. Prepare fresh 2x MSC freezing medium, and put it on ice until use. Make MSC pellets by following the Steps C5b-C5h.Dislodge the cell pellets by finger tapping, and resuspend the cells in MSC low glucose medium to make a single cell suspension. Count the total cell number using a hemocytometer and adjust the cell density to 2 x 106 cell/ml. Add the same volume of cold 2x MSC Freezing Medium into the MSC cell suspension, and mix them thoroughly.Aliquot 1 ml cell mixture into each cryogenic vial. Each cryogenic vial contains 1 x 106 cells (see Note 17).Quickly put cryogenic vials into the freezing container, and keep it at -80 °C overnight. The next day, transfer cryogenic vials with cells into -180 °C freezer or liquid nitrogen tank for long-term storage. MSC Surface antigens analysis by flow cytometryThe hiPSC-MSCs/hESC-MSCs express similar surface antigens as hBM-MSCs. Antibodies against human antigens CD34, CD45, CD73, CD90, and CD105 can be used in this assay (see Antibodies).",
    "In this assay, hBM-MSCs can be used as positive control cells. Negative markers: CD34–, CD45–; Positive markers: CD73+, CD90+, and CD105+.The results of MSC surface antigens analysis in hiPSC-MSCs, hESC-MSCs, and hBM-MSCs were shown in Figure 2. The MSC pellets are collected as the Steps C5b-C5h.Break the cell pellets by finger tapping, and resuspend cells with cold 1% FBS in DPBS w/o Ca2+ and Mg2+.Count the total cell number using a hemocytometer, and adjust the cell density to 2 x 106 cells/ml.Transfer 2 x 105 cells (100 μl cell suspension) into 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes (see Note 18). Add corresponding amount MSC antibodies (see Antibodies) to each tube, and gently mix them by pipetting. Incubate for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Wash cell once with 1% FBS in DPBS w/o Ca2+ and Mg2+ and finally resuspend cell samples in 250 µl 4% formaldehyde-DPBS w/o Ca2+ and Mg2+. Analyze samples with a flow cytometer (LSR Fortessa) (see Note 19).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181112/20181112183907_8831.jpgFigure 2. Flow cytometric analysis of MSC surface antigens in hiPSC-ESCs, hESC-MSCs and hBM-MSCs. Expression percentages of MSC surface antigens were analyzed in hiPSC-MSCs (A), hESC-MSCs (B) and hBM-MSCs (C). Unstained cells were used as the control. Percentage of cells positive for each marker is calculated by normalizing to the unstained cells. Negative markers: CD34–, CD45–; Positive markers: CD73+, CD90+, and CD105+. Characterization of hiPSC-MSCs and hESC-MSCs by in vitro multi-potent differentiationThe hiPSC-MSCs and hESC-MSCs possess multipotent differentiation potential (Osteogenesis, Chondrogenesis, and Adipogenesis). We recommend typically performing the in vitro differentiation assay using the early passage of cells (passage 5) to characterize the multipotency of hiPSC-MSCs and hESC-MSCs (see Note 20) (Figure 3).Osteogenic differentiation of hiPSC-MSCs and hESC-MSCsNote: Osteogenic differentiation can be performed using the StemPro Osteogenesis Differentiation Kit.",
    "When the hiPSC-MSCs and hESC-MSCs reach 80% confluence in a T75 flask, wash cells with DPBS w/o Ca2+ and Mg2+. Harvest cells with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA.Count the cells and seed the cell suspension into 0.1% gelatin-coated 24-well plates at a cell density of 1 x 104 cells/cm2 with 0.5 ml MSC low glucose medium (i.e., 2 x 104 cells/well in 24-well plate). Incubate the cells in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 3 days in MSC low glucose medium. Wash cells once with DPBS w/o Ca2+ and Mg2+, and then add 0.5 ml Osteogenesis differentiation medium.Feed cultures every 3 days up to 3 weeks with the osteogenic differentiation medium.After 21 days differentiation cultivation, fix the cells with 4% formaldehyde for 30 min. Stain cells with 2% Alizarin Red S for calcium deposit identification (Figure 3A), and then acquires images using standard light microscopy. Chondrogenic differentiation of hiPSC-MSCs and hESC-MSCsNote: Chondrogenic differentiation can be performed using the StemPro Chondrogenesis Differentiation Kit. At the day of differentiation, the hiPSC-MSCs and hESC-MSCs should be 80% confluent. Aspirate MSC low glucose medium, rinse the cells with DPBS w/o Ca2+ and Mg2+, and collect the cells with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA. Count the cells and adjust hiPSC-MSCs/hESC-MSCs to a cell density of 1.6 x 107 cell/ml with the MSC low glucose medium. Seed only 5 μl droplets of hiPSC-MSCs/hESC-MSCs solution (8 x 104 cell/well) in the center of 96-multiwell plates. Place the plates back into the 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 2 h micromass cultivation.After micromass cultivating, supplement 100 μl the chondrogenesis medium to culture wells. Incubate the cells in the 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 3 weeks and feed cultures every 3 days with the chondrogenic differentiation medium.",
    "Paraffin embed chondrogenic pellets, section, and dye cells by toluidine blue staining to evaluate extracellular chondrocyte matrix (Figure 3B), and then acquire images using standard light microscopy.Adipogenic differentiation of hiPSC-MSCs and hESC-MSCsNote: Adipogenic differentiation can be performed using the StemPro Adipogenesis Differentiation Kit. Observe cells under a microscope to ensure that the hiPSC-MSCs and hESC-MSCs are at 80% confluence before differentiation. Dissociate the cells into a single cell suspension by treatment with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA.Count the cells and seed the cell suspension into 0.1% gelatin-coated 24-well plates at a density of 1 x 104 cells/cm2 with 0.5 ml pre-warmed MSC low glucose medium (i.e., 2 x 104 cells/well in 24-well plate). Incubate the cells in MSC low glucose medium in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 3 days. Wash cells once with DPBS w/o Ca2+ and Mg2+, and then add 500 μl adipogenic differentiation medium. Renew medium every 3 days, and continuously culture cells with adipogenic differentiation medium for 2 weeks. After 14 days induction cultivation, fix the cells with 4% formaldehyde for 30 min. Apply Oil Red O staining to validate the lipid droplets (Figure 3C), and then acquire images using standard light microscopy.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181112/20181112183923_4713.jpgFigure 3.
