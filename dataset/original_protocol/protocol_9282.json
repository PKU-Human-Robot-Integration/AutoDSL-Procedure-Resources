    "1.\tFixation of mouse brains and cryosectioning\nTransgenic mice are sacrificed using carbon dioxide gas, followed by decapitation and the brain extracted.\nThe brain is dissected longitudinally at the center. Half of the brain will be flash frozen on dry ice for biochemical analysis. The other will be submerged in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for at least 48 hours at 4°C.\nAfter fixation in 4% PFA for at least 48 hours, the hemi brain is transferred directly into 30% sucrose solution and placed at 4°C. At the point, the hemi brain should be floating in the sucrose solution. When the hemi brain sank to the bottom, usually requiring about 48 hours, it is ready to be embedded in OCT for cryosectioning.\nBefore cryosectioning, mount a thin layer of OCT on the knob and allow to freeze at -20°C. Remove the cerebellum from the rest of the hemi brain and place onto the layer of frozen OCT. Immediately cover the hemi brain with OCT and allow to slowly freeze at -20°C. Once the OCT embedding the brain has turned opaque, it is ready to be sectioned.\nSet the thickness of each section to 30 μm. Collect each slice into a container with D'Olomos solution.\n2.\tImmunohistochemistry procedure for neuritic plaques (free floating sections)\nTreat each section in 88% formic acid for 15 minutes. After formic acid treatment, the section will temporarily turn opaque and may appear to shrivel.\nRemove each section into a plate and wash with Tx-PBS (0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 5 min X 3 with gentle shaking.\nBlock Endogenous Peroxide blocking 0.5% H2O2 in Tx-PBS, RT 30 min with gentle shaking.\nWash section with Tx-PBS for 10 min X 3 with gentle shaking.",
    "Block section with 5% non-fat skim milk dissolved in Tx-PBS at room temperature for 1 hour with gentle shaking.\nIncubate sections in primary antibody (Biotinylated 4G8, 1:500-1:2000, Signet) diluted in Tx-PBS containing 5% milk at 4°C overnight with gentle shaking.\nWash section with Tx-PBS for 10 min X 3 with gentle shaking.\nPrepare ABC solution following manufacturer's protocol (Elite ABC, Vector Laboratories,). Incubate sections in ABC mixture for 30 min with gentle shaking.\nWash section with Tx-PBS for 10 min X 3 with gentle shaking.\nPrepare 3,3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) (Vector Laboratories) following manufacturer's protocol. Incubate sections in DAB mixture for 5-10 min. At this point, you will observe a brownish color develop on each section.\nWash section with Tx-PBS for 10 min X 3 with gentle shaking.\nFree-floating brain sections are mounted on gelatin coated slides, to help with tissue adhesion.  Sections are then air dried followed by clearing with a series of xylene and mounted in Entellen.\nPlaques are visualized under light microscopy at 40X magnification and are quantified by assessing the mean plaque count per slice for each mouse.\n3.\tThioflavin S staining procedure for detection of neuritic plaques\nMouse sacrifice and brain extraction procedure are as indicated in sections 1.1 to 1.5.\nMount 4 to 5 hemi brain sections onto a glass slide and allow to completely air dry prior to staining.\nWash slides with 70% Ethanol for 1 minute.\nWash slides with 80% Ethanol for 1 minute.\nIncubate slides in filtered (0.2 μm  filter) thioflavin S solution (1% in 80% of Ethanol) for 15 minutes. (Thioflavin S solution needs to be filtered before each use). Note: protect thioflavin S from light and protect stained slides from light.\nWash slides with 80% Ethanol for 1 minute.\nWash slides with 70% Ethanol 1 minute.",
    "Wash with distilled water twice.\nMount slides in aqueous mounting media and allow slides to dry in the dark for at least 2 hour, followed by sealing coverslip with clear nail polish. Stained sections should be stored in the dark at 4°C.\nThe green fluorescence stained plaques could be visualized with fluorescent microscropy. Analyze slides within one week because the staining will fade with time.\n4. Representative Results\nIn our recent study on the efficacy of the anti-epileptic drug and mood stabilizer valproic acid (VPA) to inhibit neuritic plaque formation, we used the above described immunostaining and thioflavin S staining procedures to identify neuritic plaques in AD model mice (3). Figure 1 represents a typical 9 month old APP23 transgenic mouse, stained with anti-Aβ using biotinylated 4G8 and detected via the ABC method. Neuritic plaques are clearly labeled with the antibody and are indicated by the white arrows. Using thioflavin S staining, we detected neuritic plaque deposition 2 month old APP23xPS transgenic mice (Figure 2).  Thioflavin S bound Aβ-containing neuritic plaques appears green under fluorescence microscopy (indicated by white arrows). We showed that with VPA treatment, neuritic plaque formation is significantly reduced (3). In another study, we studied the molecular link underlying hypoxia and AD pathogenesis. Again, using both 4G8 anti-Aβ immunohistochemistry staining and thioflavin S staining, we found that hypoxia facilitated the formation of Aβ containing neuritic plaques (4).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2831/2831fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Immunohistochemical analysis of neuritic plaque formation in AD transgenic mice.  APP23 mice at the age of 9 months were sacrificed and were dissected, fixed, and sectioned. Neuritic plaques in the hippocampal were detected using an anti-Aβ antibody 4G8 and were developed using the ABC and DAB methods. The plaques were visualized by light microscopy with 40X. White arrows point to Aβ neuritic plaques. \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2831/2831fig2.jpg",
