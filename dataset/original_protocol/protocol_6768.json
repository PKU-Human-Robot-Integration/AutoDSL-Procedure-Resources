    "Injections and imaging of fluorescent beadsNotes: To measure CSF flow profiles in the central canal of the spinal cord, we inject in brain ventricles a solution of 20 nm fluorescent beads diluted in artificial CSF (aCSF). Prior to injection, the sonication of this solution is a critical step to avoid aggregates of beads that would not enter the central canal. We successfully measured flow with beads of 20 nm and 45 nm but when diameter reaches 100 nm, beads fail to enter the central canal even after sonication. The bigger the particles, the brighter they are, and the less Brownian motion they experience, making the flow quantification more precise, but only if the beads can reach the central canal. Injection in the caudal central canal (Thouvenin et al., 2020) is possible but more complicated and not recommended as it may alter the CSF flow in the rostral central canal. We recommend injecting beads together with TexasRed to make sure that the injection was successful and to identify the boundaries of the central canal if needed. If so, 0.2% TexasRed can be added to the injection mix after the sonication step (injection Mix 2). From our experience, injections in the brain ventricles are easier (especially at larval stage) if the fish is dorsally-mounted. It is possible to perform the injection on dorsally-mounted animals, and then flip the agar block or unmount the fish to mount it again laterally in a new dish. As mounting/unmounting can increase the risk of hurting the larva, flipping a block of agar cut with a fine surgical knife (Fine Science Tools, catalog number: 10073-14) is recommended. To avoid motion artifacts, imaging of beads trajectory has to be performed on paralyzed animals.",
    "We simply added α-bungarotoxin directly to the injection mix in order to inject the animal only once and reduce experiment time. Video 1 illustrates the experimental procedure starting from the embryo dechorionation and mounting, and shows the ventricular injection. Injection mix and injection pipette preparationDilute fluorescent beads (FluoSpheres) to a 2% concentration (v/v) in aCSF in a final volume of at least 100 µl. We also recommend using large 2 ml microtubes in order to avoid dispersion of the solution during the sonication step. Keep the mix on ice.Sonicate beads by giving 3 pulses of 3-4 s each at a power output of 50 W. Make sure the mix containing diluted beads stays on ice (sonication is exothermic).Pull microinjection needles from borosilicate glass capillaries with a 2-step needle puller. Adjust temperature and pulling force to produce a long and sharp funnel shape needle with an approximate tip diameter of 1-3 µm (equivalent to egg injection pipettes).Prepare injection Mix 1 or Mix 2 (see Recipes).Fill the pipette with 4 μl of injection Mix.Connect the pipette to the Picospritzer device (Parker, Hollis, NH, USA).Cut the extremity of the pipette with pliers to get a 1-3 nanoliters injection drop. The volume of the drops can be calibrated prior to the experiment.(Optional) To calibrate the volume of the drops at a fixed ejection pressure, fill the injection pipette with a defined and fixed volume of aCSF (e.g., 0.2 µl), and connect the pipette to the picospitzer device. Prepare a dish containing mineral oil and inject drops in the mineral oil until the injection pipette is empty. Count the number of drops ejected and use it to calculate the average volume of each drop. The volumes of the drops can be adjusted by changing the ejection pressure or the diameter of the pipette tip.",
    "Embryos mounting and injection (see Video 1)Dechorionate 26-28 hpf embryos manually using fine forceps. Other dechorionation techniques such as the enzymatic digestion should be equally efficient.Anesthetize the embryos in 0.02% w/v Tricaine solution (or in a dish in contact with ice) to stop spontaneous twitches during the mounting step and rinse once mounting is done.Mount the embryos laterally in 1.5% w/v low melting point agarose. Make sure to orient thoroughly the posterior axis of the animal to image sufficiently flat and long portions of the lumen of the central canal. Add at least 1 ml of system water when agarose has solidified so that the embryo can breathe and to dilute the remaining tricaine solution.Inject previously prepared solution mix in the hindbrain (or ‘rhombencephalic’) ventricle (Figure 1). If 0.2% TexasRed were added (injection Mix 2), injection quality can be controlled by observing the brain ventricles filled with the colored solution. If not (injection Mix 1), injection quality can be assessed by observing a slight and transient swelling of the ventricle (see Video1).Put injected embryos at 28 °C for 1 h to allow the diffusion of fluorescent beads down to the central canal. Make sure system water covers the entire surface of the dish to compensate for evaporation.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Experimental procedure for mounting and injecting fluorescent beads in zebrafish embryos Optical imaging of fluorescent beads in the central canalNotes: Time-lapse images can be acquired at 26 °C using a spinning disk confocal microscope mounted in a thermostatic chamber. This allows a better control of temperature variations that may affect CSF flow properties and/or cilia beating properties. We recommend to orient the embryo always in the same direction with the rostral side on the left and the dorsal side on the top.",
    "If not, correct orientation can be restored via image processing. Note that, in wild type embryos, the ventral wall of the central canal is typically flatter than the dorsal wall. Imaging could be performed with any imaging system as long as the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is high enough, and the imaging speed is above a few frames/s. Upright or inverted spinning disk can be chosen. Spinning disk imaging seems the most adequate but widefield microscope could be suitable as well with bright fluorescent beads. Confocal or two-photon microscopes could also be used, although the imaging speed might be limited with classical confocal setups and in two-photon microscopes, the salt-and-pepper noise generated might be problematic. If TexasRed is injected together with 505/515 nm emitting beads, make sure that the emission filters of the microscope allow dual color imaging (avoid using long-pass filters that would lead to bleed-through). Because imaging was mostly performed in the sagittal plane at the embryonic and larval stage using visible laser for excitation, pigmentation was not an issue and did not therefore require the use of PTU. As the central canal shape and cilia properties may differ along the rostrocaudal axis, we recommend imaging always at the same rostro-caudal position. In our case, we focused on 3 segments above the yolk extension (Figure 1). Because spinning disk microscopes perform sharp optical sectioning, we advise using either the Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) or transmitted light channel to image somites and central canal together. If TexasRed was injected, the red epifluorescence channel can be superimposed to visualize the central canal using epifluorescence before switching to the spinning disk mode (Figure 1).Perform time-lapse 2D acquisitions at 10 frames/s for 30 s. Carefully mount the fish so that the central canal is horizontal over a long distance.",
    "By choosing the Z plane in which the apparent diameter of the central canal is maximal in the sagittal plane, imaging occurs at the center of the central canal, onto the midline. By doing so, with the 40× NA = 0.8 objective, the central canal mostly fits within the optical section.FluoSpheres flowing in the CSF are photostable: high laser power can be used with minimal photobleaching in order to get high signal to noise ratio.Use the program GeneProfile to generate the CSF flow profile from the acquired data. See Data analysis section for more details.Fit the CSF flow profile to the theoretical bidirectional flow expected in wild type embryos using the same program GeneProfile. See Data analysis section for more details.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3932/bioprotoc-11-05-3932-g001.jpgFigure 1.

When agarose has solidified, add system water. Make sure that Tricaine is diluted out.Paralyze embryos. Prepare injection pipette similarly to Step A1. Fill the pipette with a solution of 500 µM α-bungarotoxin.",
    "Perform a single 1 nl injection in the caudal-most muscles and check that it induces a full paralysis. If the central canal needs to be visualized properly, TexasRed can be injected together with α-bungarotoxin in the muscles, by replacing aCSF with TexasRed solution when diluting the α-bungarotoxin stock aliquots (see Recipes). TexasRed is able to cross the blood brain barrier and penetrate inside the central canal at early developmental stages.Optical imaging of cilia dynamicsMake sure the temperature of the room is controlled at 26 °C ± 2 °C to avoid variations in cilia beating frequency across experiments.Using a spinning disk microscope, monitor the motility of cilia via time-lapse acquisitions in 2D using a blue laser for excitation of the Arl13-GFP. Acquire a single image of TexasRed injected in the brain ventricles using a green laser for excitation to reliably measure the central canal diameter. In order to capture the highest beating frequencies, acquisition rates of 100-200 Hz should be chosen. If the system relies on a CMOS camera, the frame rate can be increased by positioning the central canal along the lines of the camera and reducing to the minimum the number of lines to image the central canal. Exposure time should be sufficient to visualize GFP-positive cilia.Use the program cilia analysis to extract cilia beating frequency, length and angle. See Data analysis section for more details."
