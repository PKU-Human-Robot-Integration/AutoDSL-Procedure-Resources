    "As noted earlier, the pig is the natural host of PRV, and the virus has a wide host range, infecting all mammals except higher primates. Human herpesviruses and rabies virus have been successfully employed to study the organization of circuits in higher species. Experiments using PRV-Bartha and its recombinants capitalize upon the clearly documented restricted phenotype of viral replication and spread established in rodents (see Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-fig-0003]). Upon infecting neurons, PRV-Bartha produces infectious progeny that traffic into the somatodendritic compartment to move across synapses and spread from postsynaptic to presynaptic neurons (i.e., retrogradely) through neurons comprising a circuit. The molecular basis of the restricted retrograde transport phenotype is well documented and derives from a deletion in the unique short region of the viral genome that eliminates the capacity of particles in the cell body to be sorted and transported in axons (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-fig-0001]). As a result, spread from presynaptic axons to postsynaptic cells is completely abrogated (i.e., an anterograde spread defect). The deletion responsible for the retrograde-only spread phenotype also reduces the virulence (e.g., lengthens the mean time to death, with markedly reduced peripheral neuropathy) and cytopathology of viral infection. Also, compared to wild-type infections, PRV-Bartha spread slower in neuronal circuits. This phenotype has been mapped to point mutations in a gene (UL21) whose function is not well understood (Curanovic et al., 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0035]; Szpara et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0117]). Collectively, these features of the viral replication and spread of PRV-Bartha based viruses have made these viruses popular tools for circuit analysis.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/68a558bb-4051-4fc5-b975-900d7786ad91/cpz1841-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3",
    "The sequential retrograde transsynaptic passage of PRV-Bartha from the stomach wall of the rat. Retrograde transport of virus from the stomach wall results in infection of parasympathetic neurons in the dorsal motor vagal nucleus (blue in D) and transneuronal spread of virus to neurons in the adjacent NTS (green in D) and area postrema (red in D). Replication and spread of infection to higher-order neurons occurs with advancing survival. Included in this extended network is the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (C and G; PVN), central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (B, F; BNST), and visceral cortices (A, E). This model has been used extensively to define the synaptic organization of preautonomic neural networks and to define approaches for statistical evaluation of the progression of infection. See Card, Kobiler, Ludmir et al. (2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0031]) for details.\nStudies of PRV and HSV have documented differential affinities of virus for different compartments of neurons, as well as glial cells (Marchand & Schwab, 1987[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0083]; Vahlne et al., 1978[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0123], 1980[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0124]). These viruses have a high affinity for axon terminals and glial cells that contributes to the restricted zone of uptake following injection of peripheral organs or the brain. Consequently, variations in the density of innervation or the cytoarchitecture of a target organ will have profound effects upon the onset of replication and the progression of infection within a circuit. In this protocol, retrograde infection of CNS circuitry is achieved through inoculation of the peripheral targets of autonomic or somatic motor neurons. Emphasis is placed upon critical steps of the method that must be followed to ensure reproducible and reliable patterns of infection. Where appropriate, reference is made to sections of the Commentary that provide a more comprehensive treatment of a particular topic.\nMaterials\nExperimental animals, e.g., rodents\nBetadine",

Among these regulations is the requirement that infected animals be confined to the BSL-2 laboratory throughout the experiment and that the laboratory be dedicated to the viral studies. These regulations may vary among institutions, and it is the responsibility of the investigator to determine the regulations that may be peculiar to their institution. It is also important to ensure that the laboratory be equipped with all of the reagents and equipment necessary for the experiment. Aseptic surgical procedures should be used, but it is also important to include precautions that protect against compromising the concentration of the inoculum (see Critical Parameters). PRV is not known to cause human infections in the laboratory. However, caution when using PRV is appropriate because there are reports of rare human infection in farm workers (Yang et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0132]).\nPerform surgery\n1. Deeply anesthetize animal with anesthetic (Davis, 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0036]).",
    "Animals should be deeply anesthetized so that they are unresponsive to sensory stimuli (e.g., tail pinch).\n2. Perform the surgical procedure appropriate for the target organ.\n3. Prepare the site of the incision as a sterile surgical field. Shave fur from the region and sterilize the field with betadine. Make the incision through the skin and underlying musculature to expose the area/organ to be injected.\nInject virus and allow post-inoculation recovery\nThe principal features that will determine the method of injection are the density of the axonal innervation and cytoarchitecture of the tissue to be injected. The following sections detail the general procedures common to injecting virus into a peripheral tissue. However, it is important to review the discussion on details of experimental design of the injection strategy that may vary according to the injected tissue (see Critical Parameters).\n4. Draw up and express sterile physiological saline prior to loading the 10-μl Hamilton syringe with virus. Repeat this process two or three times to eliminate contaminants and ensure that the syringe is delivering accurate aliquots. Perform the same draw-and-express procedure with virus; this prevents dilution of the virus with saline that may be in the bore of the needle.",
    "The saline draw ensures a tight seal of the plunger with the glass barrel of the syringe and increases the likelihood of accurately delivering the desired amount of virus to the injection target. However, it is imperative that residual saline be removed from the needle to prevent dilution of the inoculum. The importance of purging the syringe of saline cannot be overemphasized, since the microliter syringes are loaded with small volumes of virus and residual saline will dilute the inoculum. Reductions in titer resulting from dilution will introduce variability in the extent of infection between animals and, under the worst circumstances, may prevent productive replication of virus altogether (see Understanding Results).\n5. Inject the inoculum into the target tissue (the amount and number of injection sites will depend upon the density of innervation and tissue architecture). See the Critical Parameters section for a more detailed discussion of the factors that should be considered.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Do not remove or disrupt connective tissue or fascial sheaths associated with the injection target prior to injection. Envelope glycoproteins of PRV and other alpha herpesviruses have high affinity for extracellular matrix proteins, and these sheaths serve to limit diffusion of the virus from the injection site.\n6. Close incisions with sutures and/or wound clips, provide a subcutaneous injection of analgesic, and allow the animal to recover on a heating pad or under a heat lamp. When the animal is conscious, return it to its home cage and ensure that it is ambulating normally. House animals individually after virus injection. Provide food and water ad libitum and standardize the photoperiod to 12-hr light per 24-hr cycle. Weigh animals daily, as precipitous weight loss provides an important indication of viral pathogenesis.",
    "Use sutures to muscle layers of body cavities (such as the abdomen) or use wound clips to close incisions through the skin.\nBSL-2 regulations stipulate that infected animals must be confined to the BSL-2 laboratory throughout the experiment. Thus, the laboratory should contain a HEPA-filtered unit for housing the animals.\nInjected animals should be carefully monitored post-inoculation to ensure that the viral infection is not compromising their ability to attend to their bodily needs. Most institutions require that the animals be monitored twice a day, typically first thing in the morning and late in the afternoon.\nWhen attenuated strains of virus are used, essentially all elements of a circuit can be characterized within a post-inoculation interval during which animals are free of symptoms. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that even attenuated strains of virus will ultimately cause death at long survival intervals, and animals usually exhibit signs of infection at these late stages of infection. Monitoring the weight of an animal provides a reliable means of predicting the onset of debilitating consequences of infection. In unpublished observations, we noted that animals exhibit a precipitous drop of ∼20% body weight during the day preceding imminent death. Thus, it is probable that any animal that becomes lethargic and experiences a large weight loss is at risk. These animals should be anesthetized and perfused.\nPerform perfusion fixation of tissues\n7. At the appropriate post-inoculation interval, anesthetize animals (Davis, 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0036]) and sacrifice animals by transcardiac perfusion fixation. Perfuse the entire animal with PBS followed by PLP fixative to inactivate virus throughout the animal (see Paletzki & Gerfen, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0098], for perfusion fixation protocols). Remove the brain and any other tissues to be included in the analysis. Post-fix this tissue in PLP fixative for 1-2 hr at 4°C.",
    "In our experience, tissue can be post-fixed for a minimum of 2 hr or as long as 3 days, prior to cryoprotection.\nAs noted above, the entire animal should be perfused. Studies of brain circuitry classically clamp the descending aorta and perfuse only the head, since preservation of brain structure and antigenicity is the preeminent goal. Because aldehydes inactivate virus, transcardiac perfusion inactivates virus throughout the animal, a particularly important goal after peripheral inoculation.\nDispose of waste properly\n8. Treat everything that comes in contact with an infected animal during the course of an experiment as contaminated biohazardous material, including the perfused carcass, instruments, gauze, and syringes used for injections, as well as animal bedding, food, water, and caging. Place disposable materials, including animal tissues, in a biohazard bag and incinerate according to institutional regulations. Decontaminate instruments and equipment with ethanol, then wash them with standard detergents, and autoclave.\nAlthough cold sterilization procedures are generally adequate, sterilization through autoclaving is preferable. Perfused carcasses are considered as contaminated waste, even though the perfusion fixation has presumably inactivated the virus.\nAnalyze tissues\n9. Perform immunohistochemical analysis of tissues (see Support Protocols 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-prot-0008] and 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-prot-0009]).",
    "Strick and colleagues championed intracerebral injection of HSV as a means of defining multisynaptic circuits in primate brain (Hoover & Strick, 1993[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0056], 1999[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0057]; Middleton & Strick, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0093], 2002[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0094]; Zemanick et al., 1991[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0134]). This method has subsequently been widely applied using PRV in a wide variety of circuits, and is now routine in rodents. Studies of HSV have identified strains that move preferentially in either the anterograde or retrograde direction through a circuit (e.g., Zemanick et al., 1991[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0134]). Studies of PRV have shown that the virulent wild-type virus will spread in both directions through a circuit after injection into the brain, and that the attenuated PRV-Bartha strain and its recombinants only spread retrogradely through a circuit following intracerebral injection (Card et al., 1998[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0025], 1999[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0026]). Given these facts, it is of preeminent importance to select a strain of virus in which the direction of transport has been rigorously defined. Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-tbl-0001] provides a list of such viruses currently available through the CNNV (CNNV; http://www.cnnv.pitt.edu[href=http://www.cnnv.pitt.edu]).\nMany of the procedures and issues detailed in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-prot-0001] are relevant to experiments involving intracerebral injection. Since the fundamental methods outlined in this protocol are quite similar to those applied in classical tract tracing, it is advisable to consult other investigators and publications to obtain detailed guidance for procedures that have been developed for accurate intracerebral injection with classical tracers. The following protocol provides guidance for the use of PRV-Bartha and Bartha recombinants in studies involving retrograde transsynaptic passage following intracerebral inoculation.\nMaterials\nExperimental animals, e.g., rodents\nHigh-titer PRV (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-prot-0007]; Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-tbl-0001])\nPhosphate-buffered saline (PBS; see recipe)\nPLP fixative (see recipe for 4% paraformaldehyde-lysine-periodate)\nStereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf Instruments)\nStereotaxic atlas (e.g., Paxinos & Watson, 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0099]; Swanson, 1998[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0119])\nSurgical instruments\nSyringe with needle (see note below)\nSterile bone wax and gel foam",
    "Wound clips\nHeating pad or heat lamp\nAdditional materials for animal anesthesia (Davis, 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0036]), injection of animals (Donovan & Brown, 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0040]), monitoring of post-surgical condition of animals (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-prot-0001]), perfusion fixation (Paletzki & Gerfen, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0098]), and immunohistochemical localization of neurochemicals (Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-prot-0008], Paletzki & Gerfen, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0098], and Volpicelli-Daley & Levey, 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0126])\nIMPORTANT NOTE: The needle, cannula, or pulled-glass pipet used for virus injection will influence the zone of viral diffusion. Hamilton microliter syringes equipped with fixed needles of 26 to 32 G are adequate for injection of large cell groups. The needles affixed to these syringes are either blunt or have a sharpened tip with the opening on the beveled surface. If a beveled needle is used, the opening should be directed towards the cell group of interest. This is quite important, since the affinities of virions for extracellular matrix molecules restrict virus diffusion to the immediate vicinity of the injection. More restricted injections can be made with glass pipets. The pipets are pulled using standard procedures (see Chapter 6), and the tip broken back so that the internal diameter is 15-20 μm. The shaft of the pipet is placed over the needle of a Hamilton syringe preloaded with virus, and the interface is sealed with beeswax. It is important to keep the length of the glass sleeve as short as possible, since the space between the glass and the needle becomes a reservoir for virus that must be filled before virus can be ejected from the pipet tip.\nPerform surgery\n1. Deeply anesthetize animal (Davis, 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0036]).\nAnimals should be deeply anesthetized so that they are unresponsive to sensory stimuli (e.g., tail pinch).",
    "2. Secure the head in a stereotaxic frame. Make an incision to expose the cranium and use coordinates determined using a stereotaxic to position the syringe over the skull over the desired area of injection. Drill a hole in the cranium at this location and pierce the dura mater in preparation for lowering the cannula/needle/glass pipet into the brain parenchyma.\nInject virus and allow post-inoculation recovery\n3. Affix the syringe to the stereotaxic arm and lower the tip of the needle or glass pipet to the desired dorsoventral coordinate through the hole in the cranium—the needle should be lowered into the tissue slowly and left in place for approximately 5 min to allow the tissue to relax around the tip of the needle. Inject the virus at 10 nl/min and leave the needle/pipet in situ for a minimum of 5 min after completion of the injection, to reduce reflux of virus along the injection tract. Slowly withdraw the needle/pipet from the brain, fill the hole in the cranium with bone wax or gel foam, and close the scalp with wound clips.\nTypically, injection of 50-100 nl of virus will produce a restricted zone of viral uptake (see Critical Parameters for more detail). However, the cytoarchitecture of the area of injection will also be influential. Detailed information regarding the extent of viral diffusion following injection of virus alone or in combination with classical tracers can be found in Jasmin et al. (1997[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0064]), O'Donnell et al. (1997[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0096]), and Card et al. (1999[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0026]).\n4. Allow the animal to recover on a heating pad or under a heat lamp and then return it to its home cage in the animal housing unit. Monitor the animal according to the procedures detailed in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-prot-0001].\nPerform perfusion fixation of tissues",
    "5. At the desired post-inoculation interval, anesthetize and perfuse the entire animal with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde-lysine-periodate PLP fixative (see Paletzki & Gerfen, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0098], and Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-tbl-0002] for perfusion fixation protocols). Prepare the tissue for immunohistochemical localization of infected neurons (see Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-prot-0008], Paletzki & Gerfen, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0098], and Volpicelli-Daley & Levey, 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0126]).\nFor guidance in determining appropriate survival intervals, see Critical Parameters.\nTable 2.\n                Components of 4% Paraformaldehyde-Lysine-Periodate PLP Fixative Solution\ntable:\n﻿Unnamed: 0,100 ml,250 ml,500 ml,1000 ml\nParaformaldehyde,4.00 g,10.00 g,20.00 g,40.00 g\nSodium metaperiodate,0.22 g,0.54 g,1.10 g,2.14 g\nLysine,1.37 g,3.43 g,6.85 g,13.70 g",
    "The use of recombinant strains of PRV constitutively expressing different reporter proteins provides a powerful means of defining collateralization of axons within complex neural circuits (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-fig-0002]). The unique reporters expressed by these recombinants can be detected by their native fluorescence (e.g., EGFP, mRFP) or by immunocytochemical localization using monospecific antibodies (e.g., β-galactosidase and other nonfluorescent reporters). There are a variety of factors that should be considered in the design of these studies and the interpretation of data. Thus, the issues discussed in Critical Parameters and illustrated in Figure 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-fig-0004] should be carefully considered before embarking upon this type of experiment. Collection of data in fluorescence studies can be difficult without a clear understanding of the extent of infection within a circuit. We therefore recommend processing one bin of tissue for immunoperoxidase localization of viral proteins to obtain a permanent record of the distribution and density of infected neurons. The data derived from the immunoperoxidase localizations can then be used to direct the analysis of putative dual-infected neurons using immunofluorescence methods (Combs & Shroff, 2017). The following protocol is based upon the use of isogenic PRV-Bartha recombinants that express unique reporters. This method is compatible with either peripheral Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-prot-0001]) or intracerebral (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-prot-0002]) injection paradigms.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d051db6a-4c62-4e8b-be56-b7f02a081430/cpz1841-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4",

(C and D) In this case, either bacterial β-galactosidase (β-Gal; lacZ) or jellyfish enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) genes have been engineered into the gG locus, and the cell has been infected by retrograde transport from two different projection targets from a collateralized axon.

    "The goal of experiments of this type is to determine if a single population of neurons provides a common influence upon neurons in two different areas through collateralized axonal projections. To address this issue, two recombinant viruses are injected into separate targets and a temporal analysis is conducted to determine if the retrograde trans-synaptic passage of the two viruses ultimately leads to infection of a single population of neurons. However, the number of neurons that contribute to each circuit often differs in the circuits under study (see Figs. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-fig-0002] and 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-fig-0003]). Thus, it is likely that different post-inoculation intervals would be required for each virus to reach the parent collateralized neurons, and injection of the two viruses would have to be temporally separated to accommodate this difference. The importance of designing the experiment so that the two viruses reach the putative site of the collateralized neurons cannot be overstated. This is due to the fact that infection of a neuron can render it refractory to infection by a second virus that arrives after the initial infection is established (Banfield et al., 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0005]; Kim et al., 1999[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0067]). This phenomenon is called superinfection exclusion or homologous interference. It has been shown that 6 hr after infection with a PRV recombinant, cells are completely refractory to superinfection with a second PRV recombinant. Furthermore, neurons are only capable of replicating a small number of herpesviral genomes (Kobiler et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0069]; Taylor, Kobiler et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0121]). These considerations raise the possibility of false negatives, e.g., the inability of a second virus to infect neurons previously infected by another virus. Consequently, the single most important aspect of the experimental design is to determine the temporal kinetics of invasion of each recombinant virus in single-injection paradigms.",
    "Data from these single-injection studies will allow an informed determination of the timing of the injection of the two viruses (discussed in greater detail in Critical Parameters). Importantly, there is one replication-incompetent PRV recombinant, called PRV-IE180 null, that is not susceptible to superinfection exclusion (Wu et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0131]). This Becker-strain mutant contain deletions in the IE180 and Us9 genes and expresses Cre recombinase in a constitutive fashion from the human synapsin promoter, allowing long-term retrograde labeling of neurons (Oyibo et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0097]).",
    "Selection of recombinant viruses\nAs noted above, the preeminent concern in this type of experiment is that one virus will interfere with the replication of the second strain. One way of reducing this possibility is to use recombinant viruses that are isogenic and have the same titer. Other factors that are important to the success of the experiment are (1) selection of viruses that are attenuated for virulence, but maintain their invasiveness phenotype; (2) demonstration that the reporter proteins of each virus are efficiently expressed in quantities that can be detected on the basis of their native fluorescence or with immunofluorescence; and (3) availability of specific antisera produced in different species that will produce reliable localizations of each reporter protein. The native fluorescence of reporters can be used without immunofluorescence amplification, but it is important to first define the kinetics of reporter-gene expression to determine the post-inoculation interval when fluorescence is most intense within the area of interest. A large body of literature employing this approach has accumulated since the initial publication of this article in 1999. It is evident from those studies that isogenic recombinants of PRV-Bartha that express EGFP (PRV-152; Billig et al., 2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0008]; Pisano et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0101]; Smith et al., 2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0114]; Schneeberger et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0112]), mRFP (PRV-614; Banfield et al., 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0005]), or mTurquoise2 (PRV-290; Hogue et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0055]) work extremely well in this experimental paradigm; these are available through the CNNV (http://www.cnnv.pitt.edu[href=http://www.cnnv.pitt.edu]; Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-tbl-0001]).\nInjection of the recombinant viruses\nThe single most important aspect of injection in this paradigm is to ensure that syringes are not contaminated with both viruses. The best way to ensure this is to dedicate separate syringes to the different viruses. Otherwise, the procedures detailed in the earlier protocols should be used for injection of each recombinant.\nPost-inoculation survival and tissue processing",
    "The timing of the two injections should be adjusted to optimize the possibility that both viruses will reach neurons with collateralized axons within the same approximate post-inoculation interval. Nevertheless, temporal analyses should still be conducted to ensure that both of the recombinant viruses are moving through the circuitry according to the temporal profiles established in the single-injection analyses. Tissue sections should be processed using the dual-labeling immunofluorescence protocol detailed in Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-prot-0009].",
    "The conditional replication approach championed by Friedman and colleagues (DeFalco et al., 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0037]) relies upon Cre-mediated recombination of the PRV genome to generate infectious progeny. The recombinant virus engineered for this approach, PRV-2001, only replicates in the presence of Cre and expresses an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter. The recombinant carries a loxP-flanked (floxed) stop cassette in front of the thymidine kinase (TK) gene, whose expression is essential for viral DNA synthesis and production of infectious progeny in nonmitotic cells. In the presence of Cre, the loxP stop cassette is removed from the viral genome, promoting the expression of thymidine kinase and a tau-EGFP reporter. As a result, viral DNA synthesis occurs, and infectious progeny are produced within an EGFP-filled neuron. The resulting progeny are replication competent, leave the parent neuron by retrograde transport across synapses, and are capable of replicating in, and being transported through, non-Cre-expressing cells. Thus, PRV-2001 spreads efficiently through neural networks presynaptic to the first infected neuron that expressed Cre.",
    "The obvious limitation to this experiment is the expression of Cre. In the proof-of-principle study establishing the approach, PRV-2001 was injected into the tuberal hypothalamus of transgenic mice engineered to express Cre in neuropeptide Y (NPY) neurons. Injection of PRV-2001 into the tuberal hypothalamus of these animals resulted in viral replication only within arcuate NPY neurons and their presynaptic partners. The same approach was employed by Yoon et al. (2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0133]) and Campbell and Herbison (2007a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0015], 2007b[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0016]) to define neural networks presynaptic to Cre-expressing LHRH neurons in the rostral hypothalamus. An important consideration in studies using transgenic Cre-expressing animals is to ensure that the Cre-expressing neurons are sequestered within an area where it is possible to make a focal injection of PRV-2001. In many cases, phenotypically restricted expression of Cre in neurons is not functionally defined; e.g., NPY is widely expressed in areas outside of the arcuate hypothalamic nucleus. Consequently, the success of these experiments is dependent upon isolating injections of PRV-2001 to localized populations of Cre-expressing neurons. Lentivirus or adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors represent another means of obtaining targeted Cre expression (Schneeberger et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0112]).\nThe methods for using this experimental approach are the same as those detailed in the prior sections. Procedures that use PRV-2001 in combination with lentivirus vectors to induce Cre expression are detailed in the next section. The experiment can be designed such that the injection of PRV-2001 is made into the area containing the Cre-expressing neurons (for direct infection) or into a projection target containing their axons (to infect the Cre neurons by retrograde transport). The latter approach provides a further means of dissecting complex networks.",
    "More recently, Pomeranz et al. (2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0104]) developed an improved version of PRV-2001, called PRV-Introvert. Similarly, activation of TK and GFP or mCherry is dependent on the expression of Cre recombinase. However, PRV-Introvert drives fluorescent reporter expression to higher levels by using the potent, immediate-early cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. Furthermore, the risk of leaky viral replication is eliminated with the insertion of a synthetic intron into the PRV TK gene, and inversion of part of the TK exon between two loxP sites. Thus, PRV-Introvert should be the primary choice over PRV-2001.",
    "As noted above, the primary limitation of PRV-2001 methodology is that the virus must have access to Cre-expressing neurons to replicate. This requirement eliminates the ability to conduct studies in which the Cre-expressing neurons are a synapse or more away from a projection target. Combining the development of conditional Brainbow reporter cassettes (Livet et al., 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0079]) with viral transneuronal tracing has provided a powerful means of addressing this limitation (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-fig-0002]). The Brainbow cassette places genes encoding fluorescent proteins in sequence, separated by loxP stop cassettes. In the absence of Cre, the cassette only expresses the first gene in the sequence. In the presence of Cre, the first gene is recombined from the cassette either alone or in combination with the second gene. Thus, the presence of Cre provides a means of conditional reporter expression.\nThe PRV-263 strain of PRV contains the Brainbow 1.0 L cassette in the gG locus of PRV-Bartha (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-fig-0004]), and is therefore isogenic with PRV-152 (EGFP reporter) and PRV-614 (mRFP reporter). The virus is replication competent in all neurons, is transported retrogradely through neural circuits, and expresses dTomato fluorescence unless in the presence of Cre. When Cre is present, the dTomato gene is recombined from the viral genome alone or in combination with the mCerulean gene. Cre-mediated recombination therefore produces conditional expression of either the mCerulean or EYFP gene products. Recombination of the viral genome by Cre is permanent, so subsequent retrograde spread of virus from the Cre-expressing neurons will also mark neurons with the conditional reporters of infection.",
    "Similar to studies employing PRV-2001, the utility of PRV-263 is directly related to the ability to obtain targeted expression of Cre. Transgenic animals are certainly compatible with the use of PRV-263. However, the use of viral vectors allows delivery of Cre to neurons, either regionally or phenotypically defined. In the proof-of-principle experiments demonstrating the utility of PRV-263, targeted expression of Cre was achieved using lentivirus vectors (Card, Kobiler, McCambridge et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0032]). Two vectors used in the study differed only in the promoter that controlled expression of Cre. Phenotypically restricted expression of Cre in catecholamine neurons was achieved using a vector in which expression of Cre was controlled by a synthetic dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DbH) promoter (Hwang et al., 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0060]). The activity of this promoter is controlled by the Phox2a or Phox2b transcription factor, thereby restricting expression of Cre to noradrenaline- or adrenaline-containing neurons (Card et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0029], 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0030]). Regionally restricted expression of Cre was achieved by placing Cre under the control of the elongation factor 1a (EF1-a) promoter, which is ubiquitous and active in all classes of neuron.\nExperimental design",
    "Successful use of PRV-263 depends upon the presence of Cre within the cell group of interest. If viral vectors are used to generate Cre expression, the vector injection must precede injection of PRV-263 to ensure stable levels of Cre expression. Parametric studies of Cre expression from the viral vector are therefore a necessary prerequisite to informed experimental design. Analysis of Cre expression following central injection of the aforementioned lentivirus vectors demonstrated that robust expression of Cre was achieved within 7 days of injection and that expression was stable through 64 days, the longest post-injection interval examined. The temporal kinetics and magnitude of Cre expression will vary between vectors and in response to the use of different promoters, so it is essential that parametric studies be conducted for each vector.",
    "The power of PRV-263 over PRV-2001 derives from the ability to inject virus at sites synaptically distant from the Cre-expressing neurons. This allows an analysis of “microcircuits” within the context of larger labeled networks defined by a projection target. In our proof-of-principle studies, we combined injection of PRV-263 into the kidney with lentivirus vector injection into a region of brainstem (RVLM) that exerts a regulatory influence over arterial blood pressure through neural control over peripheral vascular beds and the kidneys. Cre expression from the lentivirus vector was under the control of a synthetic DbH promoter, which restricted expression of Cre to catecholamine neurons within RVLM expressing the Phox2a transcription factor. Injection of PRV-263 into the kidney produced retrograde transneuronal spread of virus through the preautonomic network synaptically linked to the kidney (Cano et al., 2004[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0019]; Huang & Weiss, 1999[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0059]; Schramm et al., 1993[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0111]). Infected neurons without access to Cre were marked by the default dTomato reporter of infection. In contrast, Cre-expressing catecholamine neurons in RVLM expressed the conditional reporters, as did neurons in the network synaptically linked to the Cre-expressing catecholamine neurons. This experimental approach is compatible with both peripheral (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-prot-0001]) and central (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-prot-0002]) injection of virus.\nThe collection of data from studies employing PRV-263 is labor intensive and requires an informed perspective on both the distribution of infected neurons within the neuraxis and the magnitude of infection within infected cell groups. Thus, similar to the approach described in Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-prot-0003], the fluorescence analysis should be preceded by an immunoperoxidase localization of infected neurons. The supplemental information published in our proof-of-principle study (Card, Kobiler, McCambridge et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0032]) contains a detailed description of the sampling strategy that we developed to optimize collection of the fluorescence data.",
    "The transneuronal tracing capabilities of viruses provides a powerful means of defining circuit organization, but until recently the method has been refractory to providing insight into the functional activity of the labeled networks. Since viral infection induces the expression of Fos (a proto-oncogene that is expressed in neurons following depolarization), this commonly used assay of neural activity is not compatible with viral tracing technology (Cano et al., 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0018]). However, due to the construction of viral strains that express genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECI), it is now possible to characterize the activity in neural networks defined by viral transport (Boldogkoi et al., 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0012]; Granstedt et al., 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0047], 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0048]; Granstedt, Bosse et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0046]; Sun et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0118]). PRV-Bartha and PRV-Kaplan recombinants engineered to express GECIs were successfully used to characterize activity in viral-labeled circuits of retinal explants (Boldogkoi et al., 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0012]). Similarly, Granstedt and colleagues constructed a recombinant of PRV-614 (PRV-369) in which the mRFP gene in the gG locus was replaced with the G-CaMP2 open reading frame under the control of the CMV immediate-early promoter (Granstedt et al., 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0047], 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0048]). Retrograde infection of neurons in the submandibular gland by injection of PRV-369 into the salivary gland allowed real-time, two-photon microscopy imaging of neuronal activity in living animals. Calcium transients due to spontaneous activity as well as stimulation were documented in the infected neurons.",
    "Virus-induced alteration of neuronal activity is an important consideration in evaluating the calcium transients observed in studies using PRV-369 and other recombinants expressing GECIs. Granstedt and colleagues demonstrated changes in both the frequency and duration of neuronal firing at longer survival intervals and suggested that these changes may be due to virus-induced toxicity and/or the host defense responses to viral infections. These data are consistent with previous slice recording studies in which neurons infected by retrograde transneuronal transport of PRV-152 (EGFP reporter) were shown to exhibit normal physiological signatures at an early point following viral infection (Irnaten et al., 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0061]; Smith et al., 2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0114]). They also make the important observation that evaluating activity within the network with GECIs should be rigorously investigated within the temporal progression of infection to clarify activity reflective of network function compared to that resulting from virus-induced alterations of neural activity.\nAnalysis of neuronal activity using expression of GECIs from the viral genome is among the newest viral transneuronal tracing applications. Accordingly, there is very little literature to draw from in recommending specific protocols. The reader is referred to those studies that have applied the technology for guidance regarding its use, strengths, and limitations.",
    "Stocks of PRV are grown in vitro in monolayers of pig kidney (PK15) cells using relatively straightforward tissue culture procedures. Some of the methods for growing the virus differ among strains (e.g., multiplicity of infection and incubation time).

Prepare monolayers of PK15 cells the day before infection. Grow the cells in 100-mm sterile plastic dishes containing DMEM/10% FBS/pen-strep (typically three plates for each viral stock). Split the cells using trypsin-EDTA so that the monolayers reach 90% confluence the following day (see Phelan, 2007, for tissue culture techniques).",
    "2. Resuspend the PRV-Bartha virus in DMEM containing 2% FBS (unsupplemented) so that 1.0 ml will provide a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. Aspirate medium from each dish of PK15 cells, wash once with PBS and aspirate, and add the virus in 1.0 ml of medium at that MOI.\nFor example, for an MOI of 0.01, infect 3 × 106 PK15 cells with 3 × 104 plaque-forming units (pfu) of PRV-Bartha.\n3. Adsorb virus stock to cells for 1 hr in a humidified 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator. Gently tilt the plates every 15 min to ensure that the medium is uniformly distributed over the surface of the monolayer.\n4. Remove unadsorbed virus particles by aspirating the medium and replacing it with 10 ml of fresh 37°C DMEM/2% FBS/pen-strep.\n5. Incubate monolayers for 2-3 days in a humidified 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator. When the monolayer shows extensive cytopathic effects, harvest the cells and medium with a plastic scraper. Combine the contents of all infected plates in one 50-ml, screw-cap conical plastic tube. Mix the contents carefully. From this tube, transfer 1 ml to each of ten microcentrifuge tubes. Store the remaining crude stock in the 50-ml screw-cap tube to be used as backup. Freeze all tubes at −70°C.\nThe length of time to incubate infected monolayers will depend upon the rate at which virus spreads through the monolayer. This time is monitored by the appearance of cytopathic changes in infected cells that can be determined by periodically examining the plate of cells with an inverted microscope. Visible cytopathic effects are the distinct rounding of cells and margination of the chromatin.\nThese crude stocks can be stored frozen at −70°C for long periods of time or can be used immediately for the preparation of purified “neurostocks” according to steps 6-10.",
    "Prepare neurostocks\n6. If the crude stocks from step 5 were stored frozen, rapidly thaw the required amount in a 37°C water bath and gently mix the samples every 5 min until all ice has just disappeared. Place the individual samples on wet ice and then sonicate each sealed tube using a cup sonicator (10 pulses for a total of 10 s at an amplitude of 80%) to disperse aggregated virus and separate virions from cellular debris. Invert the samples to mix contents and store on ice in preparation for division into aliquots.\nKeep the tubes sealed during the sonication to avoid creation of aerosols.\n7. Divide the viral stock into 1-ml aliquots in sterile 1.7-ml microcentrifuge tubes or screw-cap cryovials. Either store the vials at −70°C or continue with the separation of cellular debris to prepare the neurostock.\nUse one of these vials to determine the titer of the stock (see steps 11-18).\n8. If the virus stock has been stored frozen, thaw and sonicate each sample as described in step 6 before proceeding with the rest of the purification. Remove the cellular debris from each sample by centrifuging for 5 min at 2000 × g (5000 rpm in the Fotodyne 24 place rotor) at room temperature.\n9. Pipet off the supernatant, being careful to exclude the cell debris in the loose pellet at the bottom of each tube.\n10. Divide the supernatant containing purified virus into 100- to 200-μl aliquots in screw-cap cryovials, snap-freeze on dry ice, and store at −70°C.\nDo not aliquot in volumes less than 100 μl, since smaller volumes may produce freezing artifacts that reduce the titer. Do not freeze in snap-cap tubes because the ultra-cold, very dry environment in the freezer will “freeze-dry” the sample and inactivate the virus particles.",
    "Virus can be stored frozen in aliquots at −70°C for extended periods of time without consequence as long as the temperature remains ≤−70°C. Under no circumstances should these samples be thawed and refrozen, as this will reduce the titer of the sample. To help detect freezer failures or unexpected increases in temperature, the samples should be stored with Cryoguard M-40 thermal exposure indicators (Controlled Chemicals). These indicators remain green at temperatures below −50°C but turn irreversibly red when the temperature rises above −40°C. Samples in a box containing red thermal indicators should be discarded.\nDetermine virus concentration or titer in plaque-forming units (pfu)\n11. Prepare monolayers of PK15 cells the day before the assay is to be performed by splitting a 100-mm dish of cells that has reached confluence and plating the cells into three six-well tissue culture plates.\nCells should reach about 90% confluence at the time of use in step 14.\n12. Rapidly thaw and sonicate a 1-ml tube of crude stock (from step 7) using the procedures in step 6.\nSonication of a neurostock will aid in dispersing viral aggregates.\n13. Prepare a series of 10-fold dilutions of virus as follows:\n         \nPlace 0.9 ml of DMEM/2% FBS/pen-strep in each of seven sterile microcentrifuge tubes.\nAdd 0.1 ml of the viral stock to the first tube, mix well, and add 0.1 ml of that mixture to the second tube.\nRepeat this procedure using new tubes for the desired number of dilutions.\n14. Aspirate the medium from each well of the six-well plates and wash the cells with 37°C PBS. Add 0.2 ml each of the 10–5, 10–6, and 10–7 virus dilution to duplicate wells and return the plates to the incubator.",
    "15. Adsorb the virus to the monolayers in each well for 1 hr in a humidified 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator, taking care to rock the plate every 15 min to ensure that there is an even distribution of virus over the monolayer.\n16. Remove the plates from the incubator and aspirate the inoculum from each well. Next, add 3 ml of DMEM/1% methocel/sodium bicarbonate/2% FBS/pen-strep. Return the plates to the incubator and leave them undisturbed for 2-3 days.\nThis viscous methocel solution facilitates the formation of infected cell foci (plaque formation) by restricting the diffusion of virus particles from infected cells.\nIt is essential that the plates be undisturbed during incubation to avoid interfering with plaque formation on the monolayer, thereby ensuring accurate determination of the titer of the viral stock. PRV-Bartha titers can be reliably determined after 2 days of incubation, but other strains that spread less efficiently may require a longer incubation period.\n17. Remove the plates from the incubator and aspirate the methocel solution from each plate. Wash each well once with 37°C PBS and then add 1 ml of 0.5% methylene blue in 70% methanol. Place the plates on a rocking platform for 10 min at room temperature to ensure even staining of the monolayer. Lastly, rinse off the excess stain under a gentle stream of tap water to visualize the viral plaques.\nPlaques result from virus-induced killing of cells in the monolayer, which lift off the plastic. Plaques appear as clear holes in the monolayer surrounded by a halo of rounded cells. The staining procedure kills both virus and cells.",
    "18. To calculate the titer in plaque-forming units per ml (pfu/ml), count the total number of plaques on all countable plates, divide by the total volume plated on these plates based on the lowest dilution giving countable numbers of plaques, and multiply by the reciprocal of the lowest dilution that gave countable plates.\nAs an example, if there are 12 plaques in the well containing 0.2 ml of the 10–7 dilution and 175 plaques in the well containing 0.2 ml of the 10–6 dilution, the total number of plaques would be 187 plaques. The volume plated would be 0.22 ml of the 10–6 dilution. Thus, 187 plaques divided by 0.22 ml of the 106 gives you a titer of 8.5 × 108 pfu/ml. This method is more accurate than determining the titer based on 12 plaques, or based on the average of titers determined for each dilution.",
    "Localization of viral antigens with the immunoperoxidase method provides a reliable first step in defining and documenting the extent of viral transport through neuronal circuitry in each case (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-fig-0004]). One can then further dissect the organization and phenotype of the circuit using dual-labeling methods. The avidin-biotin modification (Hsu et al., 1981[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0058]) of the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method is presented for this purpose. It produces excellent signal against a low background with high dilutions of primary antibody.\nThese experiments are labor intensive, and it is obviously beneficial to obtain the maximum amount of information from each case. For example, as noted above, it may subsequently become desirable to establish the phenotype of neurons initially demonstrated by viral transport to contribute to a polysynaptic circuit. Since one cannot predict all possible components of a circuit that may be defined by viral transport, there is a necessary delay in the ability to perform the phenotypic characterizations. This delay could be problematic if measures were not taken to protect the antigenicity of the tissue. The following protocol for tissue processing and storage is designed to protect antigenicity and thereby maximize the amount of information that can be obtained from an experiment. Central to this approach is the storage of sectioned tissue in a glycol-based cryoprotectant that preserves tissue antigenicity for extended periods. The cryoprotectant developed by Watson et al. (1986[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0127]) has these properties. Our parametric studies have demonstrated that tissue from the same animal stored in the cryoprotectant at −20°C, but processed for immunocytochemical localization of viral antigens 10 years apart, showed no discernable differences in either the pattern or density of labeling.\nMaterials\nPerfused tissue from experimental animal (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-prot-0001] or 2)\n4% paraformaldehyde-lysine-periodate (PLP) fixative (see recipe)\n0.1 M and 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (Crawley et al., 1997[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0034]",

    "1. Remove perfused tissue and post-fix it in PLP fixative for 2-4 hr at 4°C.\nThis is sufficient to preserve tissue structure without compromising antigenicity. However, the tissue can be stored in the fixative at 4°C for as long as 3 days without consequence. Longer periods of post-fixation should be avoided, as aldehydes may hide antibody epitopes by cross-linking proteins, and thereby reduce antigenicity.\n2. Rinse the tissue in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and place it in a vial containing 20%-30% sucrose in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer at 4°C until the tissue sinks to the bottom of the vial, which indicates that satisfactory cryoprotection has been achieved.\nAdequate cryoprotection generally occurs within 12-24 hr at 4°C.\nSection tissue\n3. Prepare the tissue for sectioning in the preferred plane of section. Given that virus is often transported extensively through the CNS, particularly at long survival intervals, we typically section the entire brain in the coronal plane. In that case we have obtained excellent reproducible results using the following procedure:\n         \nBisect the brain at the level of the midbrain and place the two halves on the chuck of a freezing microtome (also see Paletzki & Gerfen, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0098], for sectioning procedures).\nFreeze the tissue to −50°C and section it at 35 μm per section throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the forebrain and brainstem. Place sections sequentially into six 1-ml vials of glycol-based cryoprotectant (Watson et al., 1986[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0127]).\nRepeat this sequential collection of sections until all of the tissue has been sectioned.\nEach vial will then contain a representative sample of sections through the brain at a frequency of 210 μm. This frequency provides an accurate sampling of all regions of the neuraxis.\n4. Store the tissue in the glycol-based cryoprotectant at −20°C.",
    "As noted above, our experience with the cryoprotectant created by Watson et al. (1986[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-bib-0127]) has demonstrated that this solution preserves antigenicity of tissue for periods of at least 10 years. This has the obvious benefit of permitting a systematic analysis of the synaptology and phenotype of neurons in a polysynaptic circuit defined by viral transport.\nRemove cryoprotectant from tissue\n5. Place the tissue in Plexiglas compartments with porous nets on the bottom and remove the cryoprotectant using four 15-min washes with 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (100 ml per wash), with agitation on a rocker platform.\nThese chambers are available from Brain Research Laboratories in a number of different sizes and with different numbers of compartments. They allow easy movement of tissue through multiple buffer changes.\nThe cryoprotectant is fairly viscous and has a tendency to adhere to tissue. As a result, if it is not completely removed, it will prevent antibody penetration and produce patchy, unreliable staining. If patchy staining is routinely encountered, increase the number and duration of washes.\n6. Optional: Reduce problems with high background by pretreating the tissue at this point as follows:\n         \nWash for 15 min in 0.5% sodium borohydride in PBS.\nThis solution bubbles, so it is important to monitor throughout the treatment and continually re-immerse the tissue in the solution rather than allowing it to accumulate on surface bubbles.\nWash four times as described in step 5, each time for 15 min, in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer.\nWash for 15 min in 0.5% H2O2/30% methanol in PBS.\nWash four times, each time for 15 min, in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer.\nThis pretreatment eliminates background without compromising antigenicity.",
    "7. Transfer the tissue to the primary antibody solution (Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-tbl-0003]) for localization of infected neurons. Dilute the primary with PBS containing Triton X-100 and normal serum according to Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-tbl-0003]. Incubate tissue 24-48 hr in the primary antiserum at 4°C, and then allow it to warm to room temperature over 30 min.\nIf necessary, the length of this step can be extended to 3 days without compromising viral antigenicity. However, longer periods of incubation should be accompanied by longer post-incubation buffer washes, to keep background staining low.\n8. Wash the tissue four times with agitation at room temperature, each time for 15 min, in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4.\n9. Dilute the biotinylated affinity-purified secondary antibody 1:200 by mixing the following:\n         \n5 μl of biotinylated secondary antibody\n20 μl of normal serum generated in same species as secondary antibody\n30 μl of 10% (v/v) Triton X-100\n945 μl PBS.\n10. Place the tissue in the diluted secondary antibody solution and incubate 60-90 min at room temperature.\n11. Wash tissue as in step 8.\n12. Combine 5 μl each of Vectastain Elite kit components A and B 90 min prior to use. Just prior to use, bring to a final volume of 1 ml with 960 μl PBS and 30 μl of 10% Triton X-100. Incubate tissue in this solution for 90-120 min at room temperature with agitation.\nThis solution will generate the avidin-biotin complex, which in this kit is conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and may be detected with DAB and hydrogen peroxide as in the following steps.\n13. Wash with buffer as in step 8.\n14. Prepare a “saturated” solution of diaminobenzidine (DAB) in TBS, pH 7.6. Filter the solution prior to use.",
    "Saturated in this context is defined as the amount of DAB that will go into a solution during 5 min of vigorous stirring at room temperature (do this in a hood). This eliminates the necessity of weighing out this carcinogen.\n15. Preincubate the tissue in the saturated DAB solution for 10 min at room temperature with occasional agitation.\n16. Add 35 μl of 30% H2O2 per 100 ml of DAB solution and monitor the reaction visually by occasionally examining a section under the microscope. To accomplish this, use a paintbrush with fine bristles to transfer a section to a bath containing TBS, pH 6, and then use the brush to manipulate the section onto the portion of a microscope slide that has been submerged in the buffer. (Make sure that the slide is not gelatin coated, since the tissue section will be returned to the DAB solution following examination.) Briefly examine the wet section under the microscope to determine the density of the immunoperoxidase reaction product relative to background staining.\nThe best staining is achieved when the specific signal is prominent, and the background is low. Of course, this can only be determined in tissue sections that contain infected neurons, so it is important to make an informed selection of the section that will be analyzed.\nThe goal of this procedure is to optimize specific staining (i.e., produce the most intense signal) while keeping the background staining low. This is typically achieved within 3 min when the reagents are used at the recommended dilutions.\n17. Terminate the reaction by washing the tissue in multiple changes of fresh 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer. Inactivate the DAB solution, and all washes, with bleach. Dispose of the solutions according to the biohazard regulations of your institution.",
    "18. Organize the sections from rostral to caudal in a dish of buffer and then mount the sections on gelatin-coated slides and let them dry on the slides overnight at room temperature.\n19. Dehydrate the slides using an ethanol series (ethanol solutions of 50%, 70%, 95%, 95% again, 100%, and then 100% again, 10 min each). Clear the slides in three changes of xylene (15 min each), and coverslip with resin for microscopic observation.",
    "Localization of unique reporters expressed by PRV recombinants provides a powerful method for further functional dissection of a polysynaptic circuit. Different-color fluorophores conjugated to species-specific secondary antibodies can be used to determine the phenotype of neurons that contribute to a multisynaptic projection, or for simultaneous localization of recombinant viruses that express unique reporters (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-fig-0002]). This approach has been greatly aided by the recent development of fluorophores that are resistant to fading so that tissues can be dehydrated, cleared, and coverslipped with minimal loss of signal.\nMaterials\nSectioned tissue in cryoprotectant (Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-prot-0008])\nPrimary antibodies generated against PRV or reporter proteins (see note below)\nPrimary antibodies generated against phenotypic markers of neurons that contribute to the circuit of interest (these antibodies should be generated in a species different from those raised against PRV; see recipe)\nSecondary antibodies generated against the IgG of the two species used for the primary antibodies, conjugated, respectively, to Cy2 and Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories)\nLight-proof vials\nFluorescence microscope (Combs & Shroff, 2017)\nAdditional reagents and equipment for immunohistochemical processing and detection of tissues (see Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-prot-0008]) and fluorescence microscopy (Combs & Shroff, 2017)\nNOTE: Antibodies against reporter proteins should be generated in different species. Reporters commonly used in the construction of recombinant strains of PRV are β-galactosidase and the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-fig-0002]). Antibodies generated against both of these reporters are commercially available from a variety of vendors.\n1. Wash cryoprotectant from tissue using the same method described in the immunoperoxidase procedure (see Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-prot-0008], step 5).\n2. Place the tissue in a mixture of the two primary antibodies diluted with PBS containing Triton X-100 and normal serum according to Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-tbl-0003]. Incubate 24-48 hr at 4°C.",
    "The antibodies must be generated in different species to prevent cross-reactivity and maintain the specificity of immunolabeling.\nThe ideal dilution for immunofluorescence labeling using the following procedures is one-tenth the dilution that produces ideal labeling with the immunoperoxidase method described in Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-prot-0008]. Thus, if an antibody is used at a 1:20,000 dilution for immunoperoxidase localizations, one can assume that it will work well at 1:2000 for immunofluorescence. However, this should be determined directly in separate parametric studies with each antiserum before initiating the dual-labeling investigations.\n3. Wash the tissue with multiple changes of 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, over 30 min at room temperature with agitation.\n4. In light-proof vials, dilute the Cy2- and Cy3-conjugated, species-specific secondary antibodies to a final concentration of 1:500 with PBS and incubate the tissue for 2 hr in this solution at room temperature with agitation.\nThese fluorophores produce green (Cy2) or red (Cy3) fluorescence and, unlike FITC and rhodamine, are resistant to fading. Cy2 and Cy3 are not as sensitive to light as other fluorophores; nevertheless, the incubations should be performed in light-proof vials and the processed slides stored in light-tight boxes to produce and preserve the optimal signal.\n5. Wash the tissue as in step 3.\n6. Mount the sections on gelatin-coated slides and air dry overnight. Dehydrate and coverslip the sections as described in step 19 of Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.841#cpz1841-prot-0008].\n7.
