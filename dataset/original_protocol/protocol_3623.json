    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of bacterial strains (day 1)\nTiming: 30–45 min\nFor the infection experiment, on day 3, pick up a single colony of bacteria and re-streak on a new CYE agar plate to prepare “2-day-heavy patch” of the strain.\nWarm up a new CYE plate at 37°C to remove condensation.\nPick up a single colony using a sterilized flat toothpick and re-streak it on the CYE plate.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C for 2 days (48 h).\nHost cell preparation (day 1)\nTiming: ∼2 h\nBefore starting this protocol, please make sure that you have semi-confluent cell culture plates. A single semi-confluent plate provides a sufficient number of cells to prepare one 24 well plate. For microscopy, we seed the cells in 24-well cell culture plates with round glass coverslips 24 h before transfection. For the HEK293T-FcγRII cells, the coverslips should be coated with poly-L-lysine (PLL) as described in steps 4–7 to increase the adherence of the cells. For the HeLa-FcγRII cells, steps 5–7 can be skipped.\nPlace sterilized round glass coverslips in the 24-well cell culture plates. Set them up in triplicates for each sample. For example, if you analyze the subcellular localization of a GFP-tagged protein in host cells infected with two L. pneumophila strains, such as the wild-type and an isogenic mutant strain, you need to prepare the cells in six wells (three wells for the wild-type strain and three wells for the mutant strain).\nAdd 250 μL of 0.001% (w/v) poly L-lysine solution to the coverslip in each well of the 24-well plates. Sink the coverslips using a sterilized pipet if they begin to float.\nGently incubate the plates in an orbital shaker for 1 h at room temperature (15°C–25°C).",
    "Remove the poly-L-lysine solution and wash the coverslips in the wells with 500 μL/well of sterilized MilliQ water three times.\nRemove the cell culture medium from the semi-confluent 10 cm dish with cells.\nAdd prewarmed 10 mL PBS.\nDetach the cells from the dish.\nFor HEK293T-FcγRII cells\nRemove PBS.\nAdd 10 mL of prewarmed fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.\nDetach the cells by pipetting.\nTransfer the cells to a sterilized 50-mL conical tube.\nFor HeLa-FcγRII cells\nRemove PBS.\nAdd 2 mL of the Trypsin/EDTA solution.\nIncubate the dish for 5–10 min in a 37°C CO2 incubator.\nGently tap the dish to detach the cells.\nAdd 8 mL of prewarmed fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and suspend the cells by gentle pipetting.\nTransfer the cells to a sterilized 50-mL conical tube.\nCount the cell number using a hemocytometer.\nSeed the cells into 24-well plates with PLL-coated coverslips (0.8 × 105 cells/well for HEK293T-FcγRII cells; 0.4 × 105 cells/well for HeLa-FcγRII cells).\nCritical: Use hygromycin-free DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C in a CO2 incubator for 24 h.\nPlasmid transfection (day 2)\nTiming: 30–50 min\nReplace the cell culture medium with fresh and prewarmed DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.\nTwenty-four hours prior to infection, transfect the host cells with plasmid DNA encoding a GFP-tagged desired protein using PEI. In the following protocol, the indicated amount of reagents is required for cells in a single well.\nDilute 1 μL of PEI with 50 μL of Opti-MEM (Gibco) in a 1.5-mL microfuge tube.\nIncubate the tube for 15 min at room temperature (15°C–25°C).\nAdd 1.25 μL of a 100 ng/μL endotoxin-free plasmid.\nIncubate the tube at room temperature (15°C–25°C) for 15 min.\nDrop PEI/plasmid/Opti-MEM mixture into cells seeded in the 24-well plates.",
    "Alternatives: We used PEI for transfection to prevent saturated signals of GFP-tagged protein. Other transfection reagents, such as lipofectamine, can also be used to transfect host cells. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for each product.\nIncubate the plates at 37°C in a CO2 incubator for 24 h.\nLegionella infection (day 3)\nTiming: 2 h-1 day ∗Varies with time of infection\nThe following protocol is an example of a case in which host cells are infected with L. pneumophila at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5.\nPrepare L. pneumophila suspension in sterilized MilliQ water.\nScrape the appropriate amount of a 2-day heavy patch of L. pneumophila grown on a CYE plate using a sterilized pipette tip (1,000 μL size) or flat toothpick and resuspend in 500 μL of sterilized MilliQ water.\nMix the bacterial solution well using a vortex and measure the absorbance of the suspension using a spectrophotometer at 600 nm (OD600).\nPrepare the bacterial suspension with an OD600 value of 0.1, which approximately corresponds to 1 × 105 bacteria/μL, in a new 1.5-mL microfuge tube.\nOpsonize L. pneumophila with anti-Legionella antibody to enhance FcγRII-mediated bacterial internalization. The preparation shown below is sufficient for cells in three wells.\nPrepare 2 mL of prewarmed DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS in a sterilized 10-mL conical tube.\nAdd 0.7 μL (1/3,000 volume) of anti-Legionella rabbit serum.\nAdd L. pneumophila (16 μL of 1 × 105 cells/μL L. pneumophila for HEK293TFcγRII; 8 μL of 1 × 105 cells/μL L. pneumophila for HeLa-FcγRII).\nShake the tubes at 37°C at 250 rpm for 30 min.\nInfect cells with the opsonized L. pneumophila.\nRemove the cell culture medium from the wells of the 24-well cell culture plates and dispense DMEM containing the opsonized L. pneumophila prepared in step 18 to the wells (500 μL/well).",
    "Centrifuge the cell culture plate at 220 × g for 5 min at room temperature (15°C–25°C) with a swing bucket rotor. This procedure involves the attachment of bacteria to the surface of the adherent cells because the L. pneumophila strains used here are non-motile.\nTo initiate infection, float the plate in a 37°C water bath for 5 min immediately after the centrifuge is stopped (Time zero of infection).\nIncubate the plate at 37°C in a CO2 incubator for 55 min.\nAt 1-h post-infection, gently wash the cells with prewarmed PBS (1 mL/well) three times to remove extracellular bacteria, and then add prewarmed DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Resume the incubation of the plate at 37°C in a CO2 incubator (time can vary as per the requirement).\nAlternatives: You can skip step 20 if the sample is taken at 1 h or less post infection.\nGently wash the cells with prewarmed PBS (1 mL/well) three times at the time of sampling.\nRemove PBS and add 500 μL/well of 4% PFA/PBS solution to fix the cells and incubate the plates at room temperature (15°C–25°C) for 15 min.\nWash the cells with PBS (1 mL/well) three times.\nOptional: The following protocol is to analyze whether a protein of interest may influence another protein, which is already known to be recruited to LCVs, by using the combination of a purified protein and semi-permeabilized host cells. Digitonin is used for semi-permeabilization in this protocol. At a given concentration of digitonin permeabilizes only plasma membrane (Arasaki et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). In some cases, the concentration of digitonin may be required to be optimized.\nAfter L. pneumophila infection, wash the cells on the coverslips in the 24-well cell culture plates with prewarmed 500 μL/well of the semi-permeabilization buffer twice.",
    "Remove the semi-permeabilization buffer and add 500 μL/well of fresh semipermeabilization buffer containing 3 μg/mL digitonin.\nIncubate at room temperature (15°C–25°C) for 4 min.\nGently wash the cells with 500 μL/well of semi-permeabilization buffer three times.\nAdd 250 μL/well of semi-permeabilization buffer containing 1–10 μg/mL protein to be analyzed. Pilot tests should be done to determine the optimal concentration of protein in advance.\nIncubate the plates at 37°C in a CO2 incubator for 1 h to allow the protein to access to the cell cytosol where LCVs are located.\nWash the cells with prewarmed 500 μL/well of the semi-permeabilization buffer twice.\nRemove the buffer and add 500 μL of 4% PFA/PBS solution and incubate the plates at room temperature (15°C–25°C) for 15 min to fix the cells.\nWash the cells with PBS (1 mL/well) three times.\nPause Point: You can pause the experiment here if needed. In this case, cover the plates with aluminum foil to protect them from light and evaporation and store them at 4°C.\nImmunofluorescent staining (day 4)\nTiming: 1 day\nWhen the infected cells are semi-permeabilized and treated with the protein as described in the previous section, begin the procedure from step 29. If not, begin from step 24. If the semi-permeabilization technique is not used, the extracellular bacteria should be immunologically stained with a blue signal to distinguish them from the intracellular bacteria (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). This procedure can help exclude the extracellular uninfected bacteria in the imaging analysis step and the LCV counting process.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/548-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Example of extracellular uninfected bacteria staining",
    "HeLa-FcγRII cells transfected with plasmids encoding GFP-LotB and the plasmid encoding FLAG-β’-COP were infected with Lp01 at an MOI of 5. After 4 h, the cells were fixed, immunostained and visualized using a fluorescence microscope. White and yellow arrows indicate extracellular and intracellular L. pneumophila cells, respectively. By using this protocol, all of L. pneumophila cells used to infect host cells can be stained with red fluorescence signal, whereas extracellular uninfected cells can be stained with both red and blue fluorescence signals. Scale bars, 10 μm.\nBlocking: Add 500 μL of 2% GS/PBS (2% goat serum prepared in PBS) per well to the fixed cells.\nIncubate the plates at room temperature (15°C–25°C) for 30 min.\nRemove the coverslips using sharp-tip tweezers from the wells of the plate and place them upside down on the drops (40 μL) of diluted anti-Legionella rat serum (1:5,000 dilution) prepared in 2% GS/PBS to stain uninfected extracellular bacteria. (Set up reactions on the parafilm placed on the flat surface.)\nIncubate the coverslips at room temperature (15°C–25°C) for 1 h in a closed container.\nReplace the coverslips in the wells with 1 mL of PBS (cell-side up) in the 24-well plates. Wash the coverslip with PBS (1 mL/well) three times.\nRemove PBS and add 500 μL of 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS to permeabilize the cell organelles so as to stain bacteria residing inside the LCV.\nGently rock the plates using an orbital shaker at room temperature (15°C–25°C) for 20 min.\nWash the cells with PBS (1 mL/well) three times.\nAdd 500 μL of blocking solution (2% GS/PBS) per well.\nIncubate the plates at room temperature (15°C–25°C) for 30 min.",

Please make sure to defrost before starting observation.\nImaging and counting the number of GFP-positive LCVs (day 5)\nTiming: 2–3 h",
    "We used an inverted microscope (TE2000-U; Nikon) equipped with a digital ORCA-ERA camera (Hamamatsu) to observe the LCVs as described previously (Kitao et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).
