    "The animal care was in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of Guangdong Province. All procedures were performed under the supervision and approval of the Ethics Committee for Animal Research, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n1. Lentiviral (LV) Production\nClone the pdgf-b cDNA into a lentiviral expression vector (pLenti6/5-eGFP or LV-eGFP) at a custom multiple-cloning site downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter using Spe I and Sal I restriction sites to construct the pLenti6/5-PDGFB-eGFP plasmid (LV-pdgfb)25.\nProduce lentiviral particles (LV-pdgfb) from HEK-293FT cells by co-transfecting with virus packaging plasmids (pLP1, pLP2, and pVSV-G) using the standard calcium phosphate method with chloroquine (final concentration: 25 µM)25.\nAfter 48 h of transfection, harvest and filter 500 mL of virus-containing supernatant with a filter (0.45 µm). Subsequently, concentrate the viral particles by ultracentrifugation at 89,000 x g for 2 h. Resuspend in 200 µL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), aliquot, and store at -80 °C.\nTo determine the titer of lentivirus, incubate HEK293T cells with serially diluted lentiviral solution for 24 h and calculate the lentiviral titer, as previously described25.\n2. Fabrication of 3D-printed PLGA/nHAp Scaffolds and LV Immobilization\nDissolve 20 g of PLGA (Poly D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) material in 20 mL of 1,4-dioxane to form a homogeneous solution. Add 2 g of nanosized HAp (nano-hydroxyapatide) powder (nHAp) to the solution; the PLGA: nHAp ratio should be 10:1 (w/w).\nStir the mixed solution vigorously (stirring speed: 1,500 rpm) at room temperature for 16 h using a magnetic stirrer to form a uniform paste. Fabricate it into porous PLGA/nHAp scaffolds using a 3D low-temperature printer with a computerized nozzle that deposits the paste layer-by-layer, bottom to top, according to a predesigned model26; the pore sizes of the scaffolds range from 200 to 400 µm.",
    "Vacuum freeze-dry the scaffolds for 48 h to remove solvent as completely as possible. Soak the scaffolds in 75% ethanol solution for 1 h for sterilization and lyophilize to get neutral, aseptic scaffolds.\n\tNOTE: The major parameters for vacuum freeze-drying include the condensation temperature (°C) and vacuum degree (Pa). Under a vacuum degree of 45 Pa, the PLGA/nHAp scaffolds were vacuum freeze-dried at -78 °C for 48 h to thoroughly remove the solvent.\nAdd 10 µL of LV particles (4.5 x 105) to each PLGA/nHAp scaffold (4 mm x 4 mm x 2 mm) and incubate the scaffolds for 2 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator to allow adsorption.\nAfter immobilization, rinse the scaffolds twice with PBS to remove unbound LV particles. Snap-freeze the LV particle-coated scaffolds in liquid nitrogen, lyophilize again, and store at -80 °C for future use.\n3. In Vitro Kinetics of LV Particle Release from Scaffolds and LV Transduction Activity Assay\nIncubate 3D scaffolds (4 mm x 4 mm x 2 mm) carrying LV-green fluorescent protein (LV-eGFP, 4.5 x 105 LV particles) in 1 mL of complete DMEM in 2.0 mL cryogenic vials at 37 °C with shaking for 5 days.\nTake a 1 mL sample every 12 h from 12 h to 120 h post-incubation and replace the medium. At each time point, add 1 mL of fresh medium instead of 1 mL of incubation medium.\nUse the collected media to transduce HEK293T cells by co-incubating for 48 h. Measure the number of bioactive LV particles by determining the number of GFP-positive HEK293T cells by flow cytometry27.",
    "Before transducing the HEK293T cells, remove the culture medium and rinse the HEK293T cells twice with PBS. Add the collected media containing lentivirus released from the scaffolds to the well (1 mL/well) and culture with the HEK293T cells for 48 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator.\n4. In Vitro Assessment of Bone Marrow-derived MSC (BMSC) Migration\nBefore the migration assay, prepare BMSCs expressing tomato fluorescent protein (BMSCs-T) and PDGF-BB protein (BMSCs-P)28.\nPerform the BMSC migration assay with a Boyden chamber using a 24-well plate and polycarbonate filters with a pore size of 8 µm.\nPlace 0.5 mL of BMSCs (5 x 104) transfected with LV expressing tomato fluorescent protein (BMSCs-T) in the upper chambers. Place 0.5 mL of BMSCs (2 x 105) transfected with LV expressing PDGF-BB protein (BMSCs-P) in the lower chambers.\nInclude six groups in this experiment and add 500 µL to the lower compartment of each well.\n\tA. Blank control, serum-free medium only\n\tB. FBS control, medium supplemented with 10% FBS\n\tC. PDGF-BB control, 4 ng/mL PDGF-BB in serum-free medium\n\tD. PDGF-BB seize group, PDGF-BB (4 ng/mL) and anti-PDGF-BB (4 ng/mL) polyclonal antibody in serum-free medium\n\tE. BMSC group, 2 x 105 BMSCs in serum-free medium\n\tF. BMSCs-P group, 2 x 105 BMSCs-P in serum free medium.\nIncubate for 48 h at 5% CO2 and 37 °C in a humidified incubator. Afterwards, remove the migrated cells on the lower chamber side and collect them for quantification of the number of BMSCs-T by flow cytometry.\nRemove migrated cells on the lower chamber side using a cell scraper and resuspend the migrated cells with 2 mL of PBS. Quantify the number of migrated BMSCs-T by flow cytometry29.\n5. Establishment of a Murine Calvarial Critical Bone Defect Model and Scaffold Transplantation",
    "NOTE: Male BALB/c mice (7 weeks old) were purchased from Guangdong Medical Laboratory Animal Center (Guangdong, China).\nEnroll a total of 42 male mice for the calvarial bone defect experiment. Randomly divide the mice into three groups, with fourteen in each group that receive the following treatments: Group A, no implants; Group B, PH scaffolds implanted (PLGA/nHAp); and Group C, PHp scaffolds implanted (PLGA/nHAp/LV-pdgfb).\nAnesthetize the animals with the intraperitoneal administration of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg). Remove fur with depilatory paste and clean the head skin with 75% alcohol solution before making the first incision. Fix the head of each mouse with a stereotactic instrument to keep it still during surgery.\nMake an initial incision with a scalpel and then enlarge it with scissors to create a 1-cm linear skin incision. Scrape the periosteum from the bone of the cranium to reveal the bone surface of the skull using a sterile cotton swab.\nUse a trephine burr to create a 4 mm-diameter critical-size defect on the left side of the calvaria30. Transplant the scaffold into the bone defect site.\n\tNOTE: Critical size defects (CSDs) were originally defined as \"the smallest size intraosseous wound in a particular bone and species of animal that will not heal spontaneously during the lifetime of the animal.\" In this experiment, the 4 mm-diameter defect is a critical size bone defect, according to the previously study31,32.\nUse ophthalmic forceps to move the periosteum back gently to cover the surgical site. Suture the incised skin with three stitches per cm.",
    "Perform post-operational care. Administer the analgesic buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) to relieve pain. Maintain the body temperature with a heating pad until the animal awakens. Subsequently, feed the animals with food and water and record their activity every day until the end of the test. Note: Analgesia can be administered prior to the procedure depending on your local animal care committee guidelines. \n6. In Vivo Imaging of Angiogenesis Within the Bone Defect with MPM\nNOTE: FITC-conjugated 250 kD dextran (10 mg/mL) in saline was intravenously injected into mice to obtain high-SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) images of new blood vessels according to a previous study33.  Please note that this is a survival procedure. \nAssemble the multiphoton microscopy (MPM) system for two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) and second harmonic generation signal (SHG) imaging.\nAnaesthetize the animals with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg) and immobilize the animals on a heating plate to maintain their body temperature at 37 °C throughout the experiments. Use 3.0% isoflurane gas in 100% oxygen to maintain satisfactory anesthesia and analgesia during the imaging process. Intraperitoneally inject saline (200 µL/animal) to prevent dehydration before imaging.\nTune the femtosecond Ti-Sapphire laser to 860 nm. Create a 512 x 512 µm sampling area by scanning a pair of galvo mirrors and use NA1.0 water-immersion objective lens to focusthe excitation beam into the sample and to collect the backscattered TPEF/SHG signal.",
    "NOTE: The imaging was performed on a home-build multiphoton microscopic imaging system (MPM). During imaging, a femtosecond Ti-Sapphire laser was tuned to 860 nm as the optimal excitation wavelength. The laser beam was raster scanned across a sample plane using a pair of galvanometer mirrors. After passing through a dichroic mirror of 685 nm, the beam was focused on the specimen by a 20X NA1.0 objective. The induced TPEF and SHG signals were collected by the same objective. The signals were split from the excitation laser by the dichroic mirror mentioned above and purified by a 680-nm short-pass filter. The TPEF and SHG signals were collected by a fiber bundle and conducted to a spectrograph. The detector on the spectrograph was a linear array of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). The combination of spectrograph and linear array PMTs offered the capability to record the signal in 16 consecutive spectral bands, from 400 nm to 600 nm, at 12.5-nm intervals. Therefore, the TPEF and SHG signals were detected at the same time and separated in spectral domains. Furthermore, for 3D imaging, an axial motor was used to control the imaging depth. The area of each image was set to 512 x 512 µm, and the depth interval was set to 2 µm (control group, 5 µm). Notably, 5 sites on each defect were imaged to collect statistically significant data, and the selected imaging sites were distributed evenly and randomly along the defect.\nScan 5 sites on each defect to collect statistically significant data to measure vessel formation.\nUse scanning sites evenly and randomly distributed along the defect. For the control group, have the field of view (FOV) cover both the original bone area and the edge of the defect, but for the PH and PHp groups, have the FOV on the implanted scaffold.",
    "Make a 1-cm linear skin incision using a scalpel and suture the open skin to the fixation to reveal the transplantation site. Use a syringe to place a drop of water between the dipping lens and transplants to form a water glass.\nAcquire image stacks every 12 s over a 2 h imaging period. Display and analyze volumetric data using a custom MATLAB program and quantify the blood vessel areas with ImageJ software34,35.\n7. Gene Expression Analysis of pdgf-b and Angiogenesis-related Genes by RT-qPCR\nNOTE: PCR was performed following the usual steps: 95 °C for 30 s, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s, and 60 °C for 30 s. Post-PCR melting curves confirmed the specificity of single-target amplification, and the fold change of the gene of interest relative to β-actin was determined. The reaction for each sample was tested three times.\nHarvest implanted scaffolds and tissues from the experimental mice at 2, 4, and 8 weeks post-operation36; control group samples (n = 4), taken at the same time points, should be from adjacent bone tissue.\n\tNOTE: At each time point (2, 4, and 8 weeks), euthanized the mice with CO2 inhalation. Dissect the calvaria and, subsequently, remove and harvest the implanted scaffolds from the calvaria.\nUse a commercial reagent to extract the total RNA from each sample according to the manufacturer's protocol. Use the Reverse Transcription Kit to reverse-transcribe the RNA into cDNA following the manufacturer's protocol.\nPerform quantitative real-time PCR using the SYBR Green Detection System; the primers are listed in Table 1.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\nPrimer(5'–3'),Primer(5'–3'),Primer(5'–3'),Primer(5'–3'),Primer(5'–3'),Primer(5'–3'),Primer(5'–3'),Primer(5'–3')\nGene,Gene,Forward,Forward,Reverse,Reverse,Reverse,Reverse\npdgfb,CATCCGCTCCTTTGATGATCTT,CATCCGCTCCTTTGATGATCTT,CATCCGCTCCTTTGATGATCTT,GTGCTCGGGTCATGTTCAAGT,GTGCTCGGGTCATGTTCAAGT,GTGCTCGGGTCATGTTCAAGT,GTGCTCGGGTCATGTTCAAGT\nvWF,CTCTTTGGGGACGACTTCATC,CTCTTTGGGGACGACTTCATC,CTCTTTGGGGACGACTTCATC,TCCCGAGAATGGAGAAGGAAC,TCCCGAGAATGGAGAAGGAAC,TCCCGAGAATGGAGAAGGAAC,TCCCGAGAATGGAGAAGGAAC\nVEGFR2,GAAATGACACTGGAGCCTACA AG,GAAATGACACTGGAGCCTACA AG,GAAATGACACTGGAGCCTACA AG,TCCATGCTGGTCACTAACAGAA G,TCCATGCTGGTCACTAACAGAA G,TCCATGCTGGTCACTAACAGAA G,TCCATGCTGGTCACTAACAGAA G\nβ-actin,GTATCCATGAAATAAGTGGTTAC AGG,GTATCCATGAAATAAGTGGTTAC AGG,GTATCCATGAAATAAGTGGTTAC AGG,GCAGTACATAATTTACACAGAAG CAAT,GCAGTACATAATTTACACAGAAG CAAT,GCAGTACATAATTTACACAGAAG CAAT,GCAGTACATAATTTACACAGAAG CAAT\nTable 1: Pimer Sets.\n8. MicroCT Analysis of Bone Regeneration",
    "Euthanize mice with CO2 inhalation at 8 weeks post-operation. In a well-ventilated environment, gently place each mouse into a clean mouse cage and pump CO2 gas into the cage to anaesthetize the mice before the euthanasia.\nDissect the skull for microCT imaging of the bone defect region. User the following scanning parameters in the experiments: 9 µm resolution, Al 0.5 mm filter, 50 kV voltage, and 142 µA current.\nReconstruct all imaging data using commercial software provided by the company. Calibrate the scans using the calibration function of a CTAn software.\n\tNOTE: Place a Hounsfield unit (HU) under the mice in each scan.\nSubscription Required.
