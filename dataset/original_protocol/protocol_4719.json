    "Primary neuron-glia cultures are prepared from cortical tissues of 1-day-old neonatal Sprague-Dawley pups.After the rats are sacrificed, their brains are quickly removed aseptically. Under the stereo surgical microscope, the blood vessels and meninges are removed by tweezers.Cerebral cortices (6~8 pups cerebral cortices/tube) are dissected under sterile conditions and kept on ice in conical tube containing 10 ml of Hank’s solution (without Ca2+ or Mg2+). Remove Hank’s solution and add 15 ml of warm (37 °C) Dulbecco's modified Eagle’s media (DMEM) containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS to 50 ml conical tube. Cortical cells are dissociated by trituration using a 10 ml pipette (about 15 times). Cells are centrifuged at 4 °C (1,500 x g) for 5 min to pellet cells.After centrifugation, cells are re-suspended in 10 ml of DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS. Dilute cells for counting by adding 20 μl of cells to 180 μl of culture medium (10x dilution). Add 10 μl of the above cell dilution to a hemocytometer. Cells are counted in the 1 mm center square.Cell density is determined by the average of the 5 randomly selected squares. To calculate the total # of cells/ml = (the average count per square) x (the dilution factor) x (105/ml).Dilute the 10 ml stock to make a final concentration of 5 x 105 cells/ml.To each well of 24-well culture plates 5 x 105 cells are seeded in 0.5 ml of culture medium. The cultures are incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Culture medium is replenished five days after plating, and is changed every three days thereafter.The neuron-glial cells become confluent 10-12 days after plating.Fourteen days in vitro (DIV14), the cultures are used for experiment. The cell composition is determined by immunostaining, followed by cell counting.",
    "The neuron-glia cultures consisted of approximately 37% ± 0.8% neurons, 51% ± 1.5% astrocytes, and 7% ± 7.7% microglia (Figure 1). In addition, cultures also consist of a small percentage (<5%) of other cells including oligodendrocytes, fibroblast and endothelial cells (data not shown).The characterization of neuronal phenotypes is shown in Figure 2. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160419/20160419014156_6318.pngFigure 1.
