    "1.\tPreparation of the placenta\nThe placenta should be acquired from the delivery room as soon as possible after delivery to minimize clot formation, desiccation and overall deterioration of the tissue.\nCare should be taken to ensure that the placenta is not exposed to formalin or other fixatives.\nStandard BSL2 precautions for human tissue should be maintained and personnel should wear a mask, gown, gloves and shoe covers.\nPlace the placenta in a large plastic or metal bowl that has precut holes to allow for the drainage of fluid.  This bowl should be placed inside a larger stainless steel bowl to prevent spillage.\nWash the placenta with warm saline.\nFor better placental visualization, use Metzenbaum scissors to excise the inter-twin amniotic membranes being sure not to injure the placenta itself.  Leave a Â½ cm cuff of inter-twin membrane in place. (Figure 1A).\n2.\tCatheterization of the placental vessels\nIdentify the cords of the respective twins.  The obstetricians usually identify each twin by the number of clamps placed on each cord.  Be sure to confirm which cord supplied the presenting twin (twin A).\nOne at a time, keeping track of which cord is which, transect each cord just below the clamps (Figure 1B).  Gently milk clot out from the vessels (Figure 1C).  At the cut edge of the cord there will be one vein and at least one, usually two, arteries.  Arteries are identified by their relatively smaller diameter (compared to the vein) and surrounding muscular cuff (Figure 1D).\nUse a standard radial arterial line guide wire, 0.46 mm diameter and 80 cm long (Arrow, Reading PA, USA), with a soft tip to gain access to an arterial orifice on the cut edge of twin A's cord (Figure 1E).",
    "The guide wire should be placed a minimum of 3 cm into the vessel.  Gentle counter tension on the nonvascular portion of the cut edge of the cord using a Kelly clamp greatly facilitates advancement of the wire.  Minor turning of the cord to straighten the tortuous vessels may help with wire advancement.  Care should be taken to avoid false passages. \nUsing the Seldinger technique, thread a 20 cm long 0.6-1.19 mm inner diameter polyethylene catheter (Intramedic, Batavia IL, USA) with a bluntly beveled distal end over the wire into the artery (Figure 1F). Care must be taken not to dislodge the wire while advancing the catheter.  Remove the wire after catheter is seated at least 3 cm into the vessel.\nAlternatively, some groups have had success without use of a guidewire and direct cannulation of the umbilical vessels with umbilical artery catheters.  Although, this technique works well in our hands the use of a guidewire has decreased the time it takes us to complete the procedure.\nAttach an 18 G blunt tip needle (BD Biosciences, Franlik Lakes, NJ, USA) to the proximal end of the tubing. Ensure proper placement of the catheter by injecting a small amount of saline into the vessel and observing clearing of distal arteries. Gentle finger sweeps on the vessels while injecting saline may help facilitate movement of any residual clots. \nCarefully repeat steps 2.3 to 2.6 for the vein of twin A with attention to avoid dislodging the arterial catheter.\nTie a piece of umbilical tape 1 cm distal to the cut edge around the cord and catheters.  Ensure a tight seal to avoid back flow.",
    "Repeat step 2.3 to 2.9 for the cord of twin B (the non-presenting twin) such that there are catheters in an umbilical artery and vein of each twin secured with umbilical tape and both circulations have been infused with saline (Figure 2).\n3.\tInjection of colored dye into the placental vessels\nPathology dye, barium suspensions, gelatin or other viscous colored dyes can be used to visualize the placental vasculature. Choose four contrasting colors with which to inject the arteries and veins of twins A and B.  The colors for the artery and vein for each twin should be readily distinguishable. Superficial anastomoses should be detectable by dye mixing and the formation of a different (blended) easily detectable color.\nUse a 3ml syringe to hand inject the artery of twin A with dye at low pressure. Gently sweep with one or two fingers along the vessels in the direction of dye flow to ensure filling of the entire vascular tree.  If a superficial vascular anastomosis is identified, manual occlusion of the feeding vessel can be employed to allow the rest of the higher resistance vascular bed to fill (Figure 3A).\nUse a separate 3ml syringe to hand inject the artery of twin B (Figure 3B). \nRepeat steps 3.2 and 3.3 for the venous injections.\nIf dye leaks from an injured vessel, repair should be performed with a fine suture and a needle driver.  Take care not to suture ligate the whole vessel.\nUsing a high-resolution digital camera take an image after each injection. After all injections are complete, remove the specimen from the bowls, place against a color neutral background and re-image (Figure 4). Document the number and type of connections seen between the twins' circulations. \n4.\tRepresentative Results:",
    "Artery to artery anastomoses (AAs) have been shown to be \"protective\" as they are associated with a significant decreased risk of TTTS and with improved outcomes for both twins5. Figure 4 demonstrates an injected MC twin placenta. An AA had been prospectively identified by in utero Doppler ultrasound.  This finding was confirmed by the mixing of twin A arterial (yellow) and twin B arterial (blue) dye in a communicating arterial structure (green, arrow). An AV anastomosis with artery from twin A (yellow) and vein from twin B (orange) is also demonstrated (arrow head).  Figure 5 and 6 depict photographs of two other placental specimens we injected.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2837/2837fig1.jpgFigure 1. (A) The amniotic membrane is carefully removed from the fetal surface  of the shared MC placenta with Metzenbaum scissors. (B) A clean edge of the umbilical cord of twin A is exposed by proximal transection with Metzenbaum scissors. (C) Clot is milked from the cord by manual compression. (D) The umbilical arteries (arrowheads) and vein (arrow) of twin A are identified. (E) After placement of a Kelly clamp on the avascular portion of the cut surface of the cord for traction, a guide wire is placed in the umbilical artery of twin A and gently advanced through the tortuous vessel. (F) A small catheter is then advanced over the guidewire into the vessel lumen using the Seldinger technique.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2837/2837fig2.jpgFigure 2.  Catheters have been placed in one umbilical artery and in the umbilical vein of each twin.  These catheters are secured in place with umbilical tape ties around the entire cord.  The correct positioning of each catheter has been confirmed and intraluminal clots have been cleared by the injection of warmed normal saline.",
