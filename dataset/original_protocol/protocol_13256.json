    "This experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Zhejiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and all procedures adhered to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The study used adult male SD rats (see Table of Materials) with a body weight ranging from 330 g to 350 g. All rats were housed in a standard animal facility with a light-dark cycle of 12 h, temperature of 24 ± 2 °C, and humidity of 50 ± 5%. The rats were provided with adequate food and water supply. The following protocol provides a detailed description of the CNLBP model establishment and manual therapy Procedure.\n1. Establish the low back pain model according to the following steps (Figure 1)\nFeed the rats until they weigh 330-350 g, weigh them, and then inject 3% sodium pentobarbital (1 mL/kg) intraperitoneally to anesthetize them (see Table of Materials). Wait for 2 min, then gently pinch the four toes of the hind limbs with forceps, and touch the corneas of the rats with forceps to check for the absence of retraction or blinking response, indicating that the anesthesia is successful.\n\tNOTE: Autoclave all surgical instruments used in rat modeling in advance and sterilize other non-autoclavable instruments such as shavers, ELFS devices, and thermostatic tables with alcohol. The operator should wear a clean lab coat, disposable sterile gloves, mask, surgical cap, and facemask.\nApply an appropriate amount of veterinary ointment to the eyes of rats to prevent drying due to prolonged inability to close eyes after anesthesia.\nPlace the rat in the sternal recumbent position on the constant temperature table, locate its L4-6 segment, shave the hair of the segment and disinfect it with Iodophor 3x before spreading the disposable surgical cavity drape.",
    "Cut the skin and fascia of the L4-6 segment with surgical scissors, then separate the muscles on both sides of the spinous process of the lumbar vertebrae of this segment with a scalpel.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that the muscle is entirely separated from the spinous process and that no muscle fibers remain attached to the spinous process. Furthermore, the depth of separation should extend to the transverse process of the lumbar spine.\nDrill a hole in the middle of the spinous process of L4-6 with a 5 mL syringe needle, then load the External link fixation system (ELFS) (see Table of Materials) onto the spinous process of L4-6.\nDisinfect with iodophor, then suture after intramuscular injection of 100,000 units of penicillin (see Table of Materials) on each side of the wound.\n\tNOTE: Push the ELFS device forward to lower the height of the ELFS device before suturing, then suture under the skin to prevent infection.\nTake an X-ray before the rat is awake to determine whether the ELFS device is successfully attached to the L4-6 spinous processes (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: Place the rat in the sternal recumbent position on the constant temperature table (see Table of Materials) after taking the radiographs, wait until it is awake, then return it to the cage, and do not leave it unattended until it is awake.\nAs previously reported17, feed each model rat in a single cage for 2 weeks, and if the ELFS device does not fall off at the end of the 2 weeks, the CNLBP modeling is considered successful.",
    "NOTE: During the postoperative recovery period, a few rats will develop abscesses in the lumbar region due to infection; in this case, use a 2.5 mL syringe to aspirate the pus, then flush the wound with saline, and finally press the wound with a cotton ball for a few seconds.\nTo prevent the rats from damaging each other's ELFS devices, continue to keep each model rat in a single cage after the 2-week recovery period.\n\t​NOTE: To prevent the psychological depression of rats caused by single-cage feeding, place a plastic ball toy (see Table of Materials) in the cage.\n2. Procedure for manual therapy on CNLBP model rats (Figure 3)\nBefore MT, conduct finger strength stability exercises on a weighing table (see Table of Materials) for 2 weeks. During the exercise, maintain a controlled finger kneading force at approximately 600 g with a frequency of two times per second. Conduct the exercise once a day for a duration of 10 min each time.\nBefore MT, acclimate the model rats to the rat pouch for 1 week. Place the upper body of the rat into the pouch, with the lumbar region and lower limbs exposed. Simultaneously, softly stroke the lumbar region of the rats to encourage them to accept the contact between the fingers and the lumbar region.\n\tNOTE: Cut the shape of a piece of fabric into a fan shape with a top angle of 90° and a radius of 12 cm. Then, sew the two sides of the scalloped fabric together to make a rat pouch (see Supplementary Figure S1).",
    "Place the rat in a rat pouch. At this time, the upper half of the rat's body is covered by the rat pouch, and only the waist and lower limbs are exposed. Hold the rat's upper body in a \"C\" shape using the non-dominant hand, while performing MT on the rat's lumbar region with the dominant hand.\n\tNOTE: Do not hold the rat's torso too tightly when holding it with the non-dominant hand. The rat's thorax will be compressed and breathing will be impeded if the rat is held too tightly. It will also cause the rat to become very resistant.\nFind the exact location of the Jiaji (EX-B2) acupoints. First, determine the location of the rat's L4-6 spinous process. The Jiaji acupoints are located on both sides of L4-6, 0.5 cm from the vertebral spinous process. There are six Jiaji acupoints in total.\n\tNOTE: In rats, the spines of L6 are on the line of the two anterior superior iliac spines, and the positions of L4 and L5 can be found by counting up along the spines of L6.\nPlace the thumb on the Jiaji acupoint of the L4-6 segment of the rat and gradually increase the kneading intensity. When the model rats show resistance behaviors such as limb writhing, loud screaming, and strong struggling in the quiet state, the kneading force at that time is the maximum pressure value. Ensure that the most appropriate pressure is slightly less than the maximum pressure value, which is the maximum pressure value that the rats can tolerate without showing resistance behaviors.",
    "Start with the Jiaji acupoint on the left side of L6. After finding the most appropriate pressure level for the rat's Jiaji acupoint, hold the thumb at that pressure level as long as possible while performing a kneading action at a frequency of two times per second for a duration of one minute. Repeat for the remaining five Jiaji acupoints.\nIf resistant behavior is observed in rats during the kneading procedure, stop the thumb pressure until the rat calms down, and then resume the procedure. Ensure that the kneading process lasts for a duration of 1 min for each acupoint, even if there is an interruption during the process.\n3. Paw withdrawal threshold (PWT)\nPlace the rats in a clear Plexiglass box on wire mesh for 30 min before the official test to acclimate them to the environment.\nUse different sizes of von Frey filaments (0.6, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 15, 26 g) (see Table of Materials), after the rats have stopped exploring and grooming, vertically stimulate the middle of the left hind paw, slowly increase the pressure until the filaments are slightly bent, then stop the pressure and maintain the pressure value for 5 s.\n\tNOTE: Avoid the thicker area of skin in the middle of the hind paw when stimulating the hind paws with the filament.\nRecord positive behavior as X if the rat shows a leg retraction or foot-licking response and give a lower level of stimulus filament. Record the absence of positive behavior as O and give a higher level of stimulus filament.\n\tNOTE: The interval between two adjacent stimuli should be greater than 30 s.",
    "Detect 4x in a row when X and then a sequence of consecutive X O is obtained, and then convert the sequence to the corresponding PWT value according to the method of Chaplan18.\n4. Paw withdrawal latency (PWL)\nPlace the rats in the Hargreaves Apparatus (see Table of Materials) for 30 min before the formal test to allow them to acclimate to the environment.\nSet the instrument parameters as follows: maximum light exposure time 20 s; light exposure intensity 50% (see Supplementary Figure S2).\n\tNOTE: The maximum light exposure time should not exceed 20 s to avoid burning the rat's paws, which would affect the accuracy of subsequent test values.\nAlign the + on the heat stimulator with the center of the rat's left hind paw after the rat has stopped exploring and grooming. Click Start, and when the rat exhibits foot lifting behavior and the instrument automatically stops timing, record the resulting time value. Perform a total of five tests for each rat.\n\tNOTE: The interval between each test for the same rat is at least 5 min to avoid burning the rat's hind paw skin.\nRemove the maximum and minimum values from the five values measured for each rat, and take the average of the remaining three values as the PWL value of the rat.\n5. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining\nAnesthetize rats with sodium pentobarbital at the end of 2 weeks of MT and euthanize all rats by cardiac perfusion after they are completely anesthetized.\nRemove the left psoas muscle from rat L5 and immerse in 4% paraformaldehyde (see Table of Materials) for 48 h fixation.\nTrim the tissue to the appropriate size and place it in an embedding box (see Table of Materials), and then use the Automatic Dehydrator (see Table of Materials) for dehydration.",
    "Use paraffin wax to embed the tissue, and then cut the tissue into 5 µm thick sections.\nMount the sections on slides and bake for 4 h.\nPlace tissues in the Automatic Stainer (see Table of Materials) for subsequent dewaxing, hematoxylin staining, differentiation, bluing, eosin staining, dehydration, and transparency19.\nSeal the sections with Neutral Resin (see Table of Materials) and leave in a ventilated place for 24 h.\nScan the slides using a Digital Slide Scanner (see Table of Materials).\nSubscription Required.
