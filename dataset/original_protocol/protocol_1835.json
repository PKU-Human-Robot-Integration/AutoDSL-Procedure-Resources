    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPart 1: Ligature application on the mouse maxillary second molar\nTiming: 2–4 h\nTying the ligature is the most critical step of the entire experiment. It must be done efficiently, without causing harm to the mouse. This step will take some practice to master. If possible, use a pre-euthanized mouse to practice on before moving on to one that is alive. The greatest danger in this step is accidentally puncturing the buccal mucosa with the forceps during the ligature tying process. Depending on the severity of the puncture, this can cause bleeding. Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G\nCritical: If the ligatures are tied wrong or loosely, the majority of them will fall off during the incubation time as the mice chew on them. It is not ideal to keep checking the ligature once applied since that will stress the mice. Therefore, robust ligature application and secure tying are critical.\nAdministration of Ketamine and Xylazine anesthesia\nWeigh the mouse by putting a container on a scale and zero it. Put the mice in the container to determine their weight.\nMove the mice to the procedure area where the microscope (Seiler) is set up.\nAspirate anesthesia mixture in the syringe (BD Biosciences) to prepare before handling mice\nScruff the mouse in one hand to immobilize. Intraperitoneally (i.p.) inject the mixture of Ketamine (87.5 mg/kg) and Xylazine (12.5 mg/kg). This means a 20-g mouse will receive 0.1 mL of the mixture.\nPlace the mouse in a cage and wait 4 min for the mouse to enter a complete anesthetic state. You may check this by tail or foot pinch movement.\nOnce the mouse is in a complete anesthetic state, open the jaw and position it in the stabilizing jaw retraction plate (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).",
    "Position microscope so that the second maxillary molar is visible\nUse surgical forceps (Fine Science Tools) to pull out a ligature string from the microcentrifuge tube with CMC and bacteria mix.\nGrasp the ligature with the tips of the forceps and move into the oral cavity of the mouse.\nCritical: Using the wrong forceps will cause the ligature to slip during the tying process (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nProceed with the ligature tying procedure (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D–2H, Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nUse the second pair forceps to grab the ligature approximately 1.0 cm away and position the two forceps on the gingival and palatal sides of the mouth\nPosition the ligature between the first and second molars, and with a rocking motion, gently press down on the ligature so it gets lodged between the teeth (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nCritical: If too aggressive during this step, the forceps will lodge into the side gingiva or buccal mucosa and cause bleeding. If this happens, use a sterile gauze pad to soak up the blood until it stops. If this mouse is going to be used for observing the inflammatory response in the gingival area, it should be excluded from the experiment since this could interfere with the results. If these types of adverse events happen often, the operator should do more practice before handling experimental mice.\nRelease the forceps, and grab the ligature again, this time on the buccal side (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nRepeat step “b” for the second and third molars. The loose ends of the ligature should be facing the palatal side (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).",
    "Tie a surgeon’s knot on the palatal side of the tooth. Make sure it is tight by pulling on either side (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F). Use scissors (Fine Science Tools) to cut off the excess silk ligature, approximately 3 mm away from the knot (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G and 2H).\nUsing a blunt-ended needle (PetSurgical), apply 20–50 μL of additional bacteria to the ligature from the bacteria/CMC mix.\nRemove the mouse from the stabilizer plate, and place it face down under a controlled heat source, and closely monitor until it awakes and returns to normal behavior.\nCritical: check mice to make sure they are moving around the cages and resuming normal behavior before putting them back in the cages.\nAlternatives: Many of our basic laboratory reagents, supplies and equipment can be replaced by other equivalent laboratory supplies. There are a few items that we strongly recommend using the indicated supplies from the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] such as the 6-0 ligature and surgery grade forceps.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Ligature tying procedure, related to step 5 of part 1\nPart 2: Additional bacterial inoculation on the ligature (follows part 1)\nTiming: 3 days\nFor 3 days after the initial ligature tying, bacteria will be applied on and near the ligature to ensure colonization (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).\nMix bacteria with OD600 of 15 in PBS with 3% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) solution 1:1 in order to make a solution (∼109 CFU/mL) that can be easily applied to the mouse oral cavity. All bacteria, including free-floating TM7x are prepared fresh (see preparation of animals and procedure area[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2] section).\nPlace the mice in an isoflurane induction chamber adhering to the IACUC safety guidelines. Use a flow rate of 0.5–1.0 L per minute at a 5% isoflurane balanced with oxygen.",
    "Critical: mice will wake up quickly once removed from the chamber, so be swift and quick when applying bacteria in the following step. If necessary, a nose cone can also be used to allow for this procedure to be done while the mouse is continually under anesthesia.\nPerform oral infection by using a blunt-ended needle (PetSurgical).\nOpen the mouth using forceps.\nApply 20–50 μL of the solution to the side of the oral cavity where the ligature is located, making sure to cover the gingival areas around the molars.\nRemove the mouse from anesthesia and monitor recovery. Decontaminate the induction chamber by spraying it with 70% ethanol.\nRepeat steps 7–10 on the next two consecutive days.\nPart 3: Experimental endpoint—Microbiome analysis (follows part 2)\nTiming: 4 days\nFor trial termination, there are several possible follow-up procedures based on the desired readout. This procedure describes the microbiome analysis that can be performed on the ligature.\nKeep mice housed for 28 days after ligature application (see parts 1 and 2).\nEuthanize the mouse by using a CO2 chamber, following procedures approved by your institution.\nSterilize surgical scissors and forceps to avoid any contamination.\nRemove the mandible of the mouse by cutting it out to expose the maxilla.\nRemove the ligatures by using the scissors to make one cut through the ligature and then use forceps to pull it out in one piece. If there are any leftover strings, be sure to collect them as well. It is critical that all of the ligature is collected.\nPlace extracted ligature in 150 μL PBS in microcentrifuge tubes, place on ice before moving to the next step.\nCritical: Since this step may involve the collection of many ligatures, using ice will ensure that there is no significant bacterial growth during incubation.",
    "Vortex the microcentrifuge tube for 5 min and use 10 μL of the mixture to make serial dilutions of 101–5.\nPlate onto BHI blood agar plates by bead (Fisher) spreading method. These plates allow for the growth of the intended Actinomyces species.\nIncubate in a microaerophilic chamber for three days before counting small and large colonies (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). The small colonies will represent the Actinomyces bacteria that were added to the ligature. The other large colonies are members of the rest of the commensal mouse oral microbiota.\nCritical: counting colonies too early will make it difficult to differentiate the added Actinomyces from the commensal microbiota.\nUse the remaining 140 μL for DNA extraction\nMix 140 μL ligature resuspension with 150 μL of Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer from the MasterPure DNA isolation kit (Epicentre) and transfer to a stock tube (Fisherbrand) containing glass beads (Sigma).\nAdd lysozyme (Sigma) to the sample, reaching a final concentration of 2 mg/mL. Incubate for 1 h at 37°C.\nDisrupt the cells by bead beater (MP) for 3 × 30 s each at 6 m/s speed with 1 min short pauses at 4°C.\nIsolate gDNA using MasterPure DNA isolation kit. Follow manufacturer’s protocol[href=https://www.lucigen.com/docs/manuals/MA209E-MasterPure-Gram-Positive-DNA.pdf].\nIsolated gDNA can then be used for 16S rRNA sequencing. We used the Zymo sequencing core facility, which has a turnaround time of 3 weeks (not included in overall procedure time).",
    "For this experiment, each ligature can be used to generate independent 16S rRNA relative abundance data. If needed, two or more ligatures can be combined in one genomic DNA isolation method. The isolated genomic DNA can be submitted to a standard 16S rRNA sequencing facility such as the Zymo sequencing core. These core facilities generate relative abundance OTU tables, which are easy to interpret and can be used with standard graphing software such as Excel or Prism to display the outcome. From our experience, TM7x alone group does not form colonies since TM7x cannot grow without their host bacteria. Therefore, there is no need to plate ligature microbiome for this group unless the researcher is interested in learning how the total bacterial load on the ligature changes.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1428-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Quantification methods\n(A) Colonies grown on a blood agar plate. “small” colonies are from the Actinomyces used in the experiment. “Large” colonies come from the murine commensal oral microbiota. Scale bar is 2 mm.\n(B) Images of defleshed and stained molars. The region of interest is shown in yellow. Scale bar is 1 mm in length. Top image shows an example of low bone loss. Bottom image shows an example of high bone loss.\nPart 4: Experimental endpoint—Bone analysis (follows part 2)\nTiming: 2–3 weeks\nThis procedure follows part 2 of the step-by-step method details[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details] section. The same mice can be used for both part 3 and 4 of this method. Ligature can be removed and used in part 3 while remaining tissue and maxilla can be used to quantify bone resorption (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).\nKeep mice housed for 28 days after ligature application (see part 1 and 2).\nEuthanize the mouse by using a CO2 chamber.",
    "Using scissors, cut off the head of the animal from the body, and remove skin/fur from the skull. Any tooth with a missing ligature should be noted and excluded from bone analysis.\nNote: At this point, the ligatures can be removed for microbiome analysis (see part 3).\nAdd the separated skulls in small paper cups with holes and place them in a beetle colony (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A–1C).\nRemove tissue by using a beetle colony (Dermestes vulpinus) for 2 weeks.\nNote: Defleshing of the bone structures by beetles is an efficient method compared to chemical or mechanical means (Hall and Russell, 1933[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nCritical: Using the beetles for less than 2 weeks will risk incomplete flesh removal. Also, using the beetles for too long will risk excessive bone degradation from digestive acids.\nRemove the maxilla from the beetle colony, and quickly clean with double distilled water (ddH2O).\nBleach the maxillae by washing in 5% hydrogen peroxide (Fisher) for 8 h. Place on a platform shaker (New Brunswick Scientific) to make sure they are mixed well (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nStain with 1% Toluidine Blue O (Sigma) in water for 5–10 s (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nCritical: Staining for more than 10 seconds will cause over-staining and will make downstream image analysis difficult.\nPhotograph specimens by using a dissecting microscope (Vision engineering). Refer to Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B to determine optimal magnification. While taking the image, it is recommended to have a ruler (Fisher) in the frame and on the same plane as the teeth. This will enable an accurate scale determination.\nNote: we use red modeling compound (Hasbro) to hold the maxilla sideways and the ruler on the bottom (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).",
    "After establishing the scale of the image, measure the area from the cementoenamel junction to the alveolar bone crest of the second molar using FIJI software by drawing an area of interest (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nThe area is quantified in mm2. A larger area signifies a greater amount of bone loss.\nFor this procedure, the number of ligatures per group is mainly determined by the bone loss area measurement. We recommend determining the sample size by conducting a pilot experiment followed by a power analysis of the bone area that is lost. In our case, 8–10 ligatures/bone area measurement was enough to distinguish a significant bone loss difference between XH001 and TM7x/XH001 groups.\nMicro-CT 2D scanning followed by 3D reconstruction can be an additional way to determine bone resorption in ligature experiments. This analysis can be costly, however, it can help decrease the number of animals used in two ways: (1) bone analysis can be more efficient so it requires fewer maxillae to see differences, and (2) histology can be combined with bone analysis since micro-CT scan does not damage fixed gingival tissues. In addition, micro-CT scans can produce more detailed output compared to 2D image analysis, such as 3D bone analysis and bone mineralization. We did not include micro-CT analysis in our protocol since it is technically challenging and has been covered elsewhere (Park et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nPart 5: Experimental endpoint-histology analysis (follows part 2)\nTiming: ∼11 days\nIn this procedure, ligature and the tissues are kept intact so we set up an independent mouse experiment from parts 3 and 4, and we sacrifice the mice on day 10 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).\nKeep mice housed for 10 days after ligature application (see parts 1 and 2).\nEuthanize the mouse by using a CO2 chamber.",
    "Remove the entire oral palette by using a standard razor blade to cut around the molars (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A) and place in a cassette (Fisher) into 10% buffered formalin (Fisher) for 16 h in a volume at least twenty times that of the tissue sample.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1428-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Histology and immunohistochemistry\n(A) Diagram for removal of mouse palette for FFPE preparation.\n(B) Cross-section view of the intended area of interest for histology sectioning (blue box).\n(C) Immunohistochemistry for H&E (left) and Ly6G (right) stains. Scale bars represent 100 mm.\nCritical: This step can be difficult to achieve without destroying the maxillary structure. Refer to Mizraji et al. (2013)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] for a detailed protocol of this process.\nTransfer the cassettes to a container with 14% EDTA for decalcification for 10 days in a volume at least twenty times that of the tissue sample. This is done at 20°C–24°C. Use a plate rocker or platform shaker to gently mix the samples and replace the solution every 2–3 days.\nRun the samples in a standard histology tissue processor using xylene (StatLab) as a clearing agent, and embed them into paraffin (Fisher) blocks with the buccal side of the maxilla facing the bottom of the mold. This ensures that the sections will be cut on the sagittal plane.\nCritical: Make sure that the tissue is embedded as level as possible. Avoid any movement during the paraffin solidification process, as any rotation of the maxilla will make it difficult to cut a section in the region of interest (see below).\nTrim blocks until the tissue is visible, and place the block in an icy water bath for 30 min.",
    "The aim is to reach an area in between the molars, with as much of the tooth root showing as possible. See Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B for a diagram of the recommended cross-section area. See the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section for possible issues during this step.\nUsing a microtome (Leica), cut sections at 5-micron thickness onto positively charged microscope slides (Thermo Scientific). These slides can now be used for downstream histology and immunohistochemistry analysis.\nCritical: Make sure the microtome blade (C.L. Sturkey) is sharp and that the sections are coming out smoothly. Make sure there are no wrinkles in the tissue when mounting them on the slides.\nHematoxylin and Eosin staining (follows after sectioning)\nBake slides for 1 hour at 60°C (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nDeparaffinize and rehydrate sections: 3 × 5 min Xylene, 2 × 5 min 100% ethanol, 1 × 3 min 95% ethanol, 1 × 3 min 70% ethanol, 1 × 5 min ddH2O.\nHematoxylin (Polysciences, Inc.) stain for 1 min 15 s, and rinse in ddH2O 3 times.\nPlace in bluing reagent (Epredia) for 1 min, and rinse in ddH2O 3 times.\nEosin (Epredia) staining and dehydration: 1 × 30 s Eosin, 3 × 2 min 95% ethanol, 3 × 2 min 100% ethanol, 3 × 5 min Xylene.\nCoverslip (Fisher) slides using Xylene-based mounting medium (Vector).\nNeutrophil staining (follows after sectioning)\nBake slides for 1 hour at 60°C (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nDeparaffinize and rehydrate sections: 3 × 5 min Xylene, 2 × 5 min 100% ethanol, 1 × 3 min 95% ethanol, 1 × 3 min 70% ethanol, 1 × 5 min ddH2O.\nPerform antigen retrieval by placing slides in pH 6 citrate buffer (Fisher) at 98°C for 20 min. This can be done in an oven or a double boiler.",
    "Take slide container with citrate out of boiler/oven and place it into a container with cool running tap water and let slides cool down for 20 min.\nAfter slides are cooled down, rinse in distilled water for 5 min.\nTake slides out of the water and dry area around the tissue using a kimwipe (Fisher).\nUse a hydrophobic barrier pen (Vector) to draw a small circle around the tissue on each slide.\nBlock endogenous peroxidases by adding 3% hydrogen peroxide (Fisher) onto the sections for 10 min.\nWash sections in PBS two times.\nIncubate in normal goat serum for 20 min.\nRemove serum from slides and add on the primary antibody (Ly6G antibody, BioLegend) diluted 1:500. You should only need about 150 μL per slide. Leave primary antibody on for 1 h at 20°C–24°C. Keep slides in a covered humidified chamber (Fisher).\nNote: It is recommended to use a negative control in which no primary antibody is added.\nWash slides in PBS two times\nApply secondary antibody and subsequently the blue substrate (Vector) following the manufacturer’s protocol[href=https://vectorlabs.com/media/folio3/productattachments/protocol/SK-5300.pdf].\nDehydrate through graded alcohols and clear with xylene: 3 × 2 min 100% ethanol, 3 × 5 min Xylene.\nCoverslip with xylene-based mounting medium.\nLy6G positive cells should be quantified at 200× magnification, with the region of interest being the gingival connective tissue between the root surface of the first and second molars (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C), from the epithelial border down to the alveolar bone crest (Xiao et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]). The ligature should be excluded from quantitative analysis. Again, the number of regions of interest quantified per group is determined by a pilot study followed by power analysis. In our case, a sample size of 6–8 per group was sufficient to determine the difference between XH001 and TM7x/XH001 groups."
