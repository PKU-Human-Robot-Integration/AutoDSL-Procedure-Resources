    "The following protocol has been performed in compliance with all Canadian Blood Services (CBS) guidelines. Volunteers gave consent that their donations could be used to carry out these studies. Platelet concentrates were prepared according to CBS standard operating procedures. All performance testing described here was carried out at the Centre for Blood Research at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada with institutional Research Ethics Board approval.\n1. Quality Control Check\nPerform a quality control check at least once per testing day to verify the proper operation of the DLS system. Measure the provided control beads (50 nm radius) following the manufacturer's instructions for use.\nRetrieve the control vial from cold storage and allow 15 min to warm to room temperature. The beads must equilibrate to room temperature prior to use.\nTurn the DLS system on prior to preparing the sample so the 15 min laser warm up period is completed by the time the first sample is ready for testing.\nOnce the console has started up, follow the instructions on the touch screen to log in and select the System Test option to measure the Control sample.\nVortex mix the vial for 10 s to ensure a representative sample.\nFill a capillary with the control beads using a 100 µL fixed volume pipette, pipette tip and capillary from the test kit.\nWhen the test is completed follow the instructions on the screen of the DLS system.\n\tNOTE: The control bead test results are automatically compared to the information stored in the control bead barcode label and a PASS or FAIL notification as well as sample information are shown on the DLS system screen at the end of the test.\n2. Obtaining a sample from a platelet concentrate",
    "NOTE: These steps describe the process for non-invasive sampling from the platelet transfusion into the DLS testing capillary for routine platelet inventory management. An overview is shown in Figure 1. Required accessories: tube sealer, manual tube stripper, scissors, and splash shield.\nRemove the platelet concentrate from the untested inventory.\nObtain the sample of the platelet product either from an unused sampling pouch (proceed to step 2.3) or a tubing segment (proceed to step 2.4 if empty or step 2.5 if not empty).\n\tTo disconnect the pouch tubing or tubing segment use a tube sealer. To operate the tube sealer, follow the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, clamp the tubing to be sealed in a precise position between two heated jaws. In a handheld device, press the molten tubing together and cool under high pressure while pressing the lever (the duration is indicated by the green light) resulting in a permanent, leak-proof seal.\nSampling from a pouch\nMix the content of the platelet bag well by gentle horizontal movement for 5 s (tipping from end to end five times).\nOpen the clamp to the pouch. The pouch is evacuated and will fill by itself. It is not necessary to fill the pouch completely as only 100 µL sample will be required for DLS testing.\nDisconnect the pouch from the bag by heat sealing the connecting tubing with a tube sealer. Continue with step 3.\nSampling from empty tubing\nVerify that the platelet bag tubing has been stored empty and the tubing block is still in place. Visually inspect the tubing to verify that there is not a significant amount of platelet concentrate in the tubing. If the tubing is not empty continue with step 2.5.",
    "Close the tube stripper on the tubing as close to the tubing block as possible by compressing the handles to squeeze the tubing between the rollers.\nHang the bag vertically and keep compressing the stripper handles.\nWhile keeping the stripper closed, release the tubing block.\nSlowly pull the stripper down the empty tubing allowing for the tubing to slowly fill behind the stripper. Continue until the section below the stripper has fully inflated or until the stripper is within 1 inch of the end of the tubing.\nOnce the stopping point is reached with the stripper, use the tube sealer to heat seal the tubing 1 inch above the stripper.\nRelease the handles of the manual tube stripper.\nHeat seal again 1 to 2 inches above the previous seal to create the testing segment.\nCut off the testing segment from the platelet unit. This segment will be used for DLS testing.\nSampling from tubing that is not empty\nHang the bag vertically and release the tubing block if in place.\nVisually inspect the tubing to determine if there are any significant solid clumps. If solid clumps do exist, seal above them such that they cannot be stripped into the bag.\nClose the tube stripper on the tubing as close to the sealed end of the tubing as possible.\nStrip the contents of the tubing into the bag by compressing the handles to squeeze the tubing between the rollers and, while maintaining the clamping force, move the tube stripper along the tubing towards the bag.\nRemove the platelet bag from the hanging hook and gently mix the bag for 5 s by tipping it from end to end five times while keeping the stripper closed.\nHang the bag vertically while keeping the stripper closed.",

Continue until the section below the stripper has fully inflated or until the stripper is within 1 inch of the end of the tubing.\nOnce the stopping point is reached with the stripper, use the tube sealer to heat seal the tubing 1 inch above the stripper.\nRelease the stripper.\nHeat seal again 1 to 2 inches above the previous seal to create the testing segment.\nCut off and discard the last portion of the tubing.\nCut off the testing segment from the platelet unit. This segment will be used for DLS testing.\n3. Filling the sample into the DLS testing capillary\nUsing a splash shield and clean, dry scissors, cut one end of the pouch tubing or testing segment.\n\tNOTE: The capillary used for DLS testing should be filled immediately.\nFill the capillary by using the sampling tool (assembled 100 µL fixed volume pipette, pipette tip and capillary) to draw the sample directly from the opened pouch or tubing segment into the capillary.\nSeal the bottom of the filled capillary by gently pushing the filled capillary into the capillary tube sealant while applying a gentle twist and some pressure against the tray.\nDisconnect the 100 µL fixed volume pipette and tip from the capillary, ensuring the capillary remains firmly embedded in the capillary tube sealant.\nRemove the capillary from the capillary tube sealant tray, wipe with an isopropyl alcohol pad and ensure that no air bubbles are trapped by gently flicking the bottom of the capillary.\nPlace the capillary into the DLS system.\n4. Performing the DLS test\nSelect the MP test option to initiate a new DLS test for measuring the microparticle content of a platelet sample.",
    "Enter the sample information (Donation Identification Number (ISBT), Collection/Production Expiration Date, and Product Code) using the barcode scanner or manually. \nIf no product code is available from which the DLS system can extract the fluid medium information, select the appropriate fluid medium manually (for most platelet concentrates select plasma but for samples containing Platelet Additive Solution (PAS), enter the percentage of residual plasma).\n\tNOTE: A small deviation in the PAS percentage from the nominal 65% will cause a small error in the viscosity (automatically calculated by the DLS system) which minimally affects the calculated MP radius but not %MP. \nPlace the capillary into the DLS system when instructed and start the test.\nWhen the test is completed, remove the sample from the capillary holder and dispose of the consumables appropriately according to facility guidelines. Remove the sample from the capillary holder and dispose of the consumables appropriately according to facility guidelines.\nTag the platelet bag with the color corresponding to the result, for example orange for non-activated (homogeneous) with %MP equal or below 15% and pink for activated (heterogeneous) with %MP above 15%.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56893/56893fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Method overview.
