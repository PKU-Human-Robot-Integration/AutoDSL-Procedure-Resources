    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPrepare the liquid solutions\nTiming: 15 min\nThe objective of this step is to create the neutral and saltwater solutions used as liquid feedback in the study protocol. The neutral solution is designed to be a tasteless solution similar to artificial saliva (O’Doherty et al., 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Veldhuizen et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8], 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). This neutral solution was used instead of water, as water has been found to activate taste cortex (i.e., insula, operculum, post-central gyrus) and may be considered appetitive (Bartoshuk et al., 1964[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Zald and Pardo, 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). After completing this step, the experimenter will have all the necessary liquids needed for the Liquid Swallowing Practice and the scan session.\nPrepare the Neutral Solution.\nMeasure out 250 mL of distilled water using a graduated cylinder.\nPut the weigh boat on the digital scale and tare the scale.\nMeasure out 0.4668 g of Potassium Chloride (KCl).\nHold the weighed amount of KCl over your mixing container (e.g., glass beaker).\nPour the distilled water over it until all the substance has washed off the boat.\nRepeat this with the 0.0495 g Sodium Bicarbonate (NaHCO3).\nIf there is water left in the cylinder, add it to the mixing container.\nLift the mixing container and swirl the water around until most of the substance particles are not visible in the water.\nNote: You will want to mix relatively well to ensure that all reagents have gone into the solution.\nOnce the substances are mixed, add another 750 mL of distilled water using the graduated cylinder and mix again.\nNote: In total, you should have 1 liter of neutral solution. You can check the volume using the graduation on the mixing container.\nPour the solution into a portable container (that will be brought to the scan) and seal the lid.",
    "Prepare the Saltwater Solution.\nMeasure out 250 mL of distilled water using a graduated cylinder.\nPut the weigh boat on the digital scale and tare the scale.\nMeasure out 8.8 g of Sodium Chloride (NaCl).\nHold the weighed amount over your mixing container (e.g., glass beaker).\nPour the distilled water over it so that all the salt is washed into the mixing container.\nPour in the remaining 250 mL of distilled water.\nLift the mixing container and swirl the water around until the salt is largely dissolved within the water.\nNote: You may still see a bit of salt gathered at the bottom of the container. It is okay to see a bit of salt, but try to mix until the amount is minimized as much as possible.\nOnce the amount of salt visible in the solution is low, pour the solution into a portable container (to be brought to the scan) and seal the lid.\nPrepare the liquid delivery setup\nTiming: 30 min\nIn this step of the protocol, you will assemble the tubing and connectors that are needed to dispense liquids to participants. Each tubing setup will be composed of two merging tubes, two refill tubes, and one long mouth tube, along with stopcocks and Luer locks to be used as connectors.\nCut the Tubing.\nFrom the Tygon tubing, cut two short (1–3 inches) merging tubes, two medium-length (3–5 inches) refill tubes, and one long (12–13 ft) mouth tube.",
    "Note: The exact length of the long tube will depend on the distance of the syringe pump to the MRI scanner. See Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B for labels associated with the short and medium length tubes. The long mouth tube is not pictured, but should be long enough to connect this setup in the control room to reach the participant in the scanner bed (i.e., our setup required 12 ft of tubing, but other setups may require different length depending on the scanner setup).\nAttach the Luer locks to the stopcocks.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2130-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Preparation of liquid delivery setup\n(A) Materials for Single Liquid Delivery Setup. Includes three stopcocks, four male Luer locks, three female Luer locks, two short tubes (1–3 inches) for connecting the stopcocks, and three medium-length tubes (3–5 inches) for refilling the syringes.\n(B) Assembled Liquid Delivery Setup. The long mouth tubing (depends on the distance from syringe pump to MRI scanner) is connected at the end, and the two filled syringes are connected to the two stopcocks.\n(C) Computer Controlled Syringe Pump Liquid Delivery Setup. The liquid is dispensed from a computer-controlled syringe pump. The syringes must be secured using the metal clasp, and the knob should be turned so that the pump mode is set to automatic (e.g., the knob should be loose).\n(D) Pacifiers with Connected Tubing. The tip of the pacifier should be cut off to enable clear passage for the liquid to be dispensed. Two types of tape (e.g., masking, medical) are used to secure the tubing to the pagcifier.",
    "(E) Conceptual Schematic of Liquid Delivery Setup in the Scanner. Once the liquid delivery setup (with the merging tubes connecting the stopcocks) is secured to the syringe pump, a long mouth tubing connects the Luer lock to the pacifier. The syringe pump is controlled by a trigger sent from the computer (here via a serial port to USB connector), which dispenses a bolus of liquid to the participant. In order to switch the liquids, the experimenter can swap out the syringes and tubing. Details about switching the liquids are provided in the protocol.\nScrew a small Luer lock onto the long end of each stopcock. This end will be called the “top” end.\nWith the top end facing up, screw a large Luer lock onto the right end of each stopcock.\nScrew another large Luer lock onto the bottom end of one stopcock. [Sub-steps under the first step].\nAssemble the Liquid Delivery Setup.\nOn a table, arrange the stopcock/Luer lock combination(s) into a triangle that is pointing away from you (Illustrated in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). The stopcock with three Luer locks attached should be on top.\nAttach the two medium-length tubes to the right side of the two lower (or “base of the triangle”) stopcocks.\nNote: These will be your refill tubes. These tubes are used to fill the syringes with liquid. This is important for refilling the empty syringes after the liquid has been dispensed to the mouth tubing to reach the pacifier. Details about how the syringes are refilled are described in step 19 “Fill the syringes with each liquid.”\nUse the small tubing to attach the “base” stopcocks to the top stopcock.\nAttach the tubing to the top side of the “base” stopcocks and then to the bottom and right sides of the top stopcock.",
    "Repeat steps 4 and 5 two more times to have three complete Liquid Delivery Setups (one for each of the liquids).\nNote: While the current protocol only describes three liquid setups for the juice, neutral, and saltwater solutions, this protocol is flexible such that the experimenter can create as many liquid setups for each liquid that they will use in their respective studies (1 liquid = 1 liquid delivery setup). The Liquid Delivery Setup is illustrated in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E. As there are separate syringe setups for each liquid, the experimenter only needs to swap out the syringes for administering each liquid during the task.\nPractice swallowing liquids\nTiming: 10 min\nSince drinking liquids in a supine position (e.g., lying on the back) is not natural to many participants, it is important to have participants practice drinking liquids in this position outside of the scanner environment so they are prepared to do so when inside the bore of the scanner.\nFill two-60 mL syringes with the neutral solution.\nFrom the Tygon tubing, cut a tube that is approximately 3 ft in length (or however long the distance is between the syringe pump and the participant).\nConnect the end(s) of the syringes to the stopcocks in one of the assembled liquid delivery setups (See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nSecure the syringes in the syringe pump using the metal clasp on the pump (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nNote: More detailed instructions for securing the syringes can be found in the manual.\nCheck that the pump is configured to dispense the liquids (e.g., priming the pump).\nMake sure that the knob is turned so that the pump mode is set to automatic (e.g., the knob should be loose).",
    "Check that the amount delivered is correct (e.g., to deliver 1 mL of juice per dispense, the amount should be set to 0.5 mL because there are two syringes).\nNote: To change the amount of liquid administered, toggle through the settings on the pump. There will be a menu that will first ask you to set the amount of liquid to be dispensed, and after you hit enter, you can use the arrow keys on the pump to change this value and then click enter.\nEnsure that the liquid is flowing throughout the entirety of the tubing so that it can be dispensed to the participant by either manually pushing the liquid through the tubing with the pump or hitting the “Run” button repeatedly in the pump-controlled mode.\nCommon issues for this step are described in troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nPrepare the Pacifier.\nCut off the tip of the pacifier to enable clear passage for the liquid dispensed through the mouth tubing.\nPull the pacifier through the end of the tube so that the tube is at the edge of the opening of the pacifier (See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nHold the pacifier over a waste container and press “Run” on the pump repeatedly until the liquid drops into a waste container.\nNote: This step is important for priming the pump.\nParticipant Practice Drinking Liquids.\nHave the participant lie down and hold the pacifier in their mouth by gently biting down on it. Note that too much biting or force will impede the flow of liquid.\nRun the practice-swallowing task script.\nThis script is called “practice_drinking_liquids.m\", which can be found on OSF.",
    "Once the script has begun, you will be asked to press a key for the first practice section (single drop) and then again for the second section (five drops spaced out to simulate swallowing during the task).\nMake sure that you are clearly communicating with the participant when dispensing the liquids (e.g., “Now, we are going to practice swallowing five times in order to familiarize you with the pace of swallowing during the task\").\nOnce the swallowing practice is finished, take the pacifier from the participant and confirm that they are comfortable with drinking the amount of liquid delivered per dispense while lying down before beginning the scan.\nOptional: The liquid drinking practice can also be accomplished by manually dispensing liquid from the pump rather than using an automated script if desired.\nNote: To practice swallowing liquids while lying down, it is useful to be located in a room that has a table (e.g., an exam table in a medical setting) or a reclining chair that participants can be positioned on.\nPrepare liquid delivery setup in scanner\nTiming: 30 min\nDuring this step, you will transfer your liquid solutions and setups to the control room (next to the MRI scanner). These instructions describe the process of dispensing liquids to participants while they are in the bore of the scanner. Note that there is no special installation required to swap out the different liquid setups, and the syringes only need to be removed and replaced for each liquid delivery. For each liquid used in the study, one Liquid Delivery Setup was created.\nBring all the items for the liquid setup to the MRI control room (syringe pump, neutral syringe/stopcock setup, pacifier, and the rest of the liquid solutions and setups).\nSetup the syringe pump and laptop computer.",
    "Place the syringe pump and scanning laptop on a small table separated from the computing equipment.\nNote: In our study, this was a pragmatic choice in order to minimize the likelihood of spilled liquids damaging the computers.\nPlace some paper towels over the table and set the pump on it near the computers.\nPlug the pump into an available outlet.\nDesignate an area on the table for and prepare each liquid.\nYou will use the same Liquid Delivery Setup for the neutral solution as in the practice session.\nPlace your neutral setup (from the liquid drinking practice) on the table (but disconnect the syringes from the Liquid Delivery Setups to enable easier refill).\nIn each of the other two areas, place a stopcock/Luer lock setup and two syringes.\nFor each liquid, you will also need a filling cup and the actual liquid.\nLabel each cup so that you never accidentally use the wrong liquid in the setup (e.g., the neutral and saltwater solutions will look identical to one another; labeling will help to ameliorate any potential mix-up).\nFill the syringes with each liquid\nPour the liquids into their designated filling cups.\nMake sure that the plungers are pushed all the way through the barrel of the syringes such that the seal is closed to ensure no air bubbles.\nPlace the syringes in the cups, and pull back the plunger to fill each syringe to 60 mL (i.e., the max volume) using the cups.\nNext, attach the syringes to the stopcocks/Luer lock setups similar to during the swallowing practice.\nRefill the neutral solution syringes with more solution before reattaching them to the stopcock/Luer lock setup since the levels will have been depleted during the liquid drinking practice.\nPrepare the Mouth Tubing to Connect to the Liquid Delivery Setup.",
    "For each liquid, take out a length of fMRI-cut tubing. Note that there will one mouth tubing for each Liquid Delivery Setup (e.g., for 3 liquids, you will need 3 mouth tubes). The referenced study uses 25 ft long tubing, but this may be adjusted depending on the specific environment (e.g., you may opt to have a longer or shorter mouth tubing, depending on distance between the control room and the scanner).\nUsing the masking tape, create labels on each tube near each end of the mouth tubing. The label should be near the ends of the tubing but not so close that it will interfere with the tube being inserted into the pacifier.\nOn the labels, write the first letter of the corresponding liquid (e.g., “J\" for “juice”). This is not strictly necessary but useful to keep all tubing separate during scanning.\nMove the mouth tubing to the scanner room.\nTake your three lengths of fMRI tubing (i.e., one for each liquid type) and tape one end of each side-by-side on the table with the pump. Make sure that the labels are still visible.\nOnce the ends are taped down, secure them further to prevent them from slipping/falling while the participant is being situated in the scanner.\nNote: You can place a heavy object on the taped tubes to preven them from moving.\nWrap the free ends of the tubes together with some paper towels.\nUsing the opening between the control room and the scanner, slide the tubing through.\nNote: Before (and while) doing this, you may need to untangle the tubes a bit.\nAttach the mouth tubing to the pacifier used for liquid delivery.\nTake note of the first two liquids that will be dispensed.\nInsert the tubes that correspond to the first two liquids.",
    "Note: The pacifier has space for two tubes, and these tubes will need to be changed out with the final liquid later. Alternatively, you can set up multiple pacifiers and have the participant swap out the pacifier when switching to a liquid that requires a different mouth tubing.\nTake the tape and pacifier and enter the scanner room, also, pick up the paper towels and tubing.\nPull the tubes through the opening so that they can reach back to where the participant will be in the scanner.\nIf the tubes are tangled, you may need to pause here to untangle the tubes more. Importantly, while dealing with the tubes, make sure that the exposed ends do not touch the ground.\nInsert the two tube ends that correspond to the first two liquids (e.g., Juice, Saltwater) into the pacifier.\nCarefully tape the tubing to the pacifier.\nWrap a clear medical-grade tape around the tubes and the pacifier.\nUse the masking tape to provide an additional seal around the pacifier by wrapping it around the entirety of the pacifier.\nNote: The current setup describes two kinds of tape to fasten the tubing to the pacifier for the scanner setup. The medical-grade tape is more pliable and helps to keep the tubing and pacifier connected. The masking tape is helpful for keeping the tubing secured.\nGive the pacifier with mouth tubing to the participant.\nWrap the pacifier in a paper towel and hang it and the free tube over the scanning table so that they are hanging freely and not touching anything.\nUse tape to secure tubes to the table as you situate the participant in the scanner.\nOnce the participant is in the bore of the scanner, hand them the pacifier.",
    "Depending on the scanning protocol, you can instruct participants to keep the pacifier out of their mouths while you collect structural (or other) scans.\nOnce you are ready to begin the scans with the liquids, instruct the participant to place the pacifier in their mouth.\nFill the mouth tubing with liquid from the syringe pump.\nOnce the pacifier is connected to the mouth tubing, and the mouth tubing is connected to the liquid delivery setup, fill the mouth tubing with liquid from the syringe pump.\nNote: You will need two people for this step (one person to push the liquids through the tubing, one person inside the scanner to monitor the liquid flowing through the mouth tubing).\nMake sure the “OFF” knobs of the stopcocks are pointed downward to block the refill tubes.\nNote: This will ensure that any liquid pushed through the syringe will go directly to the mouth tubing.\nMake sure the pump mode is set to “manual” (the pump knob should be rigid).\nPush the ends of the syringe pump to dispense the liquid through the mouth tubing.\nNote: The other experimenter should be in the scanner room monitoring the liquid flowing through the tubing, and will tell the experimenter in the control room when to stop dispensing liquid (i.e., when the level reaches the pacifier and the participant can taste the liquid).\nSet the pump mode to “automatic” (knob should be loose).\nConfirm that the syringe pump dispenses a bolus of liquid prior to the start of each run.\nYou will press the “RUN” button on the syringe pump to prime the pump (i.e., dispense a bolus of liquid) to test that the pump dispenses properly.",
    "Note: You may need to press this a few times until the participant tastes the liquid. Once the participant tastes the liquid, you can set up the task scripts and scans.\nAsk the participant to confirm that they received the liquid in their mouth prior to beginning each run.\nNote: The participant should taste the liquid immediately after the bolus of liquid is dispensed triggered by the pump. Participants do not need to suck on the pacifier in order for the liquid to be delivered. Because the amount delivered is minimal (1 mL is about 1 drop), tasting the liquid should not elicit any head movement (you should have instructed the participant to keep their head still during the scan).\nNote: Prior to starting the study, it will be critical to determine that there is an opening between the control room and the scanner through which you can run the tubing for the study.\nCleaning the materials after the scan\nTiming: 1 h\nAfter the scan has finished, you can collect the supplies and clean them for future use.\nTake the liquid setups apart.\nNote: If you used tubing that was autoclaved twice, you could throw out the tubes. Otherwise, you can save them for further use after autoclaving, if desired.\nClean the Materials for Liquid Delivery Setups.\nRinse off the stopcocks and Luer locks.\nRemove the plungers from the syringes so that you can rinse out both parts.\nAfter rinsing, all connectors and syringes will need to be cleaned with hot water and bleach.\nClean the Tubing.\nTo clean the tubes, run tap water through them. F ill a syringe with air and attach a small Luer lock to it so you can attach it to the tubing.",
    "Use the syringe to pump air through the tubes until most of the liquid is gone.\nAfter rinsing the tubes, prepare them for the autoclave.\nNote: You will want to and autoclave according to the specifications on the machine if you plan to reuse them in the future.\nNote: We recommend using new tubing for the long tubes connecting the pump to the MRI to minimize the possibility of kinks in the tubing (the tubes may become sticky after being autoclaved)."
