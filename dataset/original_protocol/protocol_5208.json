    "Preparation of crude single lung cell suspensionSacrifice a mouse by CO2 inhalation in a CO2 chamber.Bring the mouse to a biosafety cabinet.Dampen the mouse with 70% ethanol.Place the mouse front side up on dissecting Styrofoam board and fix the arms and legs with needles or tape.Use scissors to make incision in the skin from abdomen to neck, and tear skin with forceps to expose thoracic cage and neck.Gently remove the muscle around the neck to expose the trachea.Carefully cut the ribs to expose the heart and lungs.Perfuse the lung with 0.9% NaCl, using a 10 ml syringe fitted with a 27 gauge needle, through the right ventricle of heart until it is visually free of blood.Use forceps to put a ~10 cm-long nylon string under the trachea.Insert the 22 G x 1” Exel Safelet Catheter into the trachea, remove stylet hub, and tie a knot with a nylon string to secure catheter and trachea together firmly.Slowly inject 2 ml of dispase into the lung, and allow the lung to collapse for 5 min.Quickly load a 1 ml syringe with 0.5 ml of 1% low melting point agarose (brought from 4 °C storage, thawed in a 70 °C water bath, and then kept in a 45 °C water bath in a melted status), replace the dispase syringe with the agarose-containing syringe, and gently infuse the lung with the loaded agarose. Leave the syringe in place, and immediately cover the lung with ice and incubate for 2 min to promote the solidification of agarose.Remove the lung from animal to a 15 ml tube containing 2 ml of dispase, incubate for 45 min at room temperature on a shaker. Note: Shaking helps dispase digestion and cell release, but the exact speed of shaking is not critical.",
    "Transfer the lung to 7 ml of room-temperature DMEM with 0.01% DNase I in a 60 mm non-coated cell culture dish. The digested tissue is carefully teased from bronchi with scissors and forceps.The resulting cell suspension is successively filtered through 70 µm and 40 µm cell strainers, and then 25 µm nylon mesh.Magnetic labelingCount the filtered cells by a hemocytometer, centrifuge cell suspension at 300 x g for 10 min at 4 °C, and then resuspend in 400 µl of labeling buffer per 107 cells.Add 5 µl of each biotinylated anti-CD45 and biotinylated anti-CD16/CD32, mix well and incubate for 10 min at 4 °C.Wash cells with 1 ml of labeling buffer and centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Resuspend cell pellet in 90 µl of labeling buffer per 107 cells. Note: In steps B4-B8, if working with fewer than 107 cells, use the same volume as indicated.Add 10 µl of Streptavidin MicroBeads per 107 cells.Mix well and incubate for 15 min at 4 °C.Wash cells with 1 ml of labeling buffer and centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Resuspend the cell pellet in 500 µl of labeling buffer.Magnetic separationPlace an MS column in the magnetic field of a suitable MACS MultiStand.Prepare column by rinsing with 0.5 ml of labeling buffer.Apply cell suspension onto the column. Collect flow-through containing unlabelled cells, representing the alveolar type II cells.Wash column 3 times with 0.5 ml of labeling buffer each. Collect unlabelled cells that pass-through, and combine with the effluent from step C3.Alveolar type II cell cultureThe combined effluents are centrifuged at 300 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.",
    "The cell pellet is resuspended to 106 cells per ml in DMEM with 10% FBS, and cultured for 12 h in non-coated cell culture plate in a humidified, 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C to remove residual mesenchymal cells attached to plate.Note: Generally, 4-5 million cells will be retrieved per mouse lung, and ~4 ml medium will be used to resuspend the isolated cells at 106 cells per ml.Cell suspensions with unattached cells (mainly alveolar type II epithelial cells) are gently collected and centrifuged at 300 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet is resuspended in DMEM with 10% FBS and cultured on a fibronectin-coated plate. The typical morphology of alveolar type II epithelial cells is shown in Figure 1. Meanwhile, genomic sequencing of cultured alveolar type II epithelial cells is performed to detect the mutations of K-Ras gene (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170514/20170514215718_6211.jpgFigure 1.
