    "Preparing silver chloride wirePlace silver wire in a 50% Bleach/50% ddH2O solution so that at least ¾ of the wire is immersed in the liquid. Leave the wire in the bleach/water solution for ~5 min to allow for sufficient chloridization to occur.Preparing recording electrode–see JoVE video ‘Making patch pipettes and sharp electrodes with a programmable puller’ by Brown et al., 2008 for reference (see Notes).Insert a single silver-chloride wire into the electrode holder, ensuring that the end of the filament contacts the metal bottom of the holder.Carefully insert a glass capillary into the micropipette puller, and set puller program to create pipettes with adequate tip size and an internal resistance of 30 MΩ when filled with 3 M KCl. These parameters may be achieved by using the programmable P-97 Flaming/Brown puller (Figure 1B) (see Notes).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170713/20170713005929_8246.jpgFigure 1. Prepared electrodes. A. Representative suction electrode polished to ~12-15 μm I.D. B. Representative recording electrode pulled using the parameters indicated in Notes. Load the elongated tip syringe with 3 M KCl and dispense enough KCl into the glass capillary to sufficiently backfill the tip. Once the tip has sufficient KCl in place, fill the glass capillary with enough KCl to ensure the electrode is at least half full.Slide the silver-chloride wire into the glass capillary ensuring that it is immersed in the KCl.Insert recording electrode into the electrode micromanipulator that will be used for grounding (Figure 5.2).Preparing suction electrodeCarefully insert a glass capillary tube, without filament, into the micropipette puller and set puller program to create pipettes with adequate tip size. Generally, the parameters used for creating the recording electrodes can also be used to make the suction electrode.Using a diamond coated bench stone (coarse side) break the tip sufficiently so that a flat opening of ~30 μm is created.",
    "Heat polish the electrode tip to reduce the I.D. to ~12-15 μm. Polishing is required to produce a sufficient taper to ensure that the CM9 MN does not come out of the electrode during recording and thus provides an adequate seal around the CM9 MN (Figure 1A).Once the suction electrode has been sufficiently polished, create a hole in the side of the electrode, about 1 cm down from the base of the tip, to allow for the placement of the silver wire. This is achieved by using the ‘fine’ side of the diamond coated bench stone to initially make a small hole. Once created, angle the suction electrode more acutely and continue scoring the glass. This will create a small gradient that will help to discourage bending of the silver wire required for stimulation (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170713/20170713010049_4371.jpgFigure 2. Representative image of the final suction electrode. Arrow indicates location of scored hole and gradient required to discourage bending of the silver wire required to stimulate the CM9 MN.Preparing fly for the experiment:Remove a single virgin female fly (see Notes) from food vial using a Pasteur pipette.Place the fly on ice until postural control is lost ~15/20 sec.Quickly transfer the fly to a small sylgard dissection surface and decapitate the head using a 30 G needle (Figure 3, right image).Place the back of the head on the dissection surface and pin the proboscis into an extended position (Figure 3, left image).Following successful pining (Figure 3, left image), cover the entire head in cold HL3 recording solution (see Recipes).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170713/20170713010229_5076.jpgFigure 3. Representative image showing fly before (right) and after decapitation (left). Dashed line indicates where on the fly to cut to successfully decapitate the head.",
    "Image on the left shows how to correctly pin out the head prior to dissecting the cuticle–black box indicates area of cuticle to be removed in order to expose the CM9 group of muscles.Dissect the anterior head cuticle containing the antennae from the preparation using a sharp tungsten needle to pierce the soft cuticle found underneath the faceplate and Vannas spring scissors to cut the cuticle. 5CO fine forceps are then used to remove any remaining tracheal air sacks that may remain after removing the faceplate. The use of 5CO forceps here to remove the remaining air sacks reduces the risk of damage to the nerve/muscles (Figure 3, left image and Figure 4B–black boxes).Re-pin the proboscis in a retracted position to increase the tension on the CM9 muscles (Figures 4B and 4C) (see Notes). The CM9 group of muscles run from the rostrum, identified by the brown/orange structure found at the end of the proboscis musculature located within the head cavity, to the bottom of the eye on either side of the head. Figure 4D indicates the translucency of the muscles and can be easily identified when compared to the more opaque fat bodies that remain within the head cavity post dissection.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170713/20170713010313_6295.jpgFigure 4.

Once in position, place both the grounding wire (Figure 5.5) and stimulation grounding wire (Figure 5.",
    "7) into the HL3 bath to ensure the formation of a complete electrical circuit. Using the 10x objective (Figure 5.3), slowly lower the suction electrode (Figure 5.6) into the HL3 bath and continue motion of the electrode until it comes into the plane of view of the preparation. Generally, as long as care is taken when lowering the electrode, the manipulator setting can be left on 1. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170713/20170713010408_3891.jpgFigure 5.

Suction electrode wire/holder; 7. Stimulator grounding wire.Once positioned, suck a loop of the CM9 MN (Figure 4C–Pharyngeal nerve) into the polished suction electrode and fill with modified HL3 to create an en passant configuration (Figure 6A). Sometimes it will be necessary to switch to the 40x objective for the purposes of sucking up the CM9 nerve as it is not always easily observed under the 10x objective.Note: There are 2 nerves that innervate the CM9 group of muscles but very little is known about the second smaller innervation and how it is involved in CM9 function. We do know that the second innervation is not a glutamatergic output due to the lack of positive vGLUT staining at the presynaptic nerve terminal. Care must be taken here to only suck up the CM9 MN and not the smaller innervation as this will impede the successful stimulation of the muscle.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170713/20170713010639_3365.jpgFigure 6. Representative mEPSP and EPSP traces from CM9 NMJ. A. Recording arrangement; B. Representative traces of an EPSP and mEPSP generated from a 7-day old animal.Intracellular recordings from CM9 muscleSlowly lower recording electrode into HL3 using coarse motion (setting 3/4) on the ROE-200 micromanipulator (Figure 5.1).",
    "Using the 10x objective, find the tip of the recording electrode and lower with caution until the electrode is in the plane of view of the preparation. Once the electrode is in the plane of view of the CM9 group of muscles finer motion is used to avoid impaling the muscle and breaking the electrode (setting 6/7 on ROE-200 micromanipulator). At this point, the objective should also be changed to 40x making sure to avoid hitting the electrodes already in position.Identify muscle to be recorded from, generally the most cranial CM9 muscle fiber accessible from the anterior position, and carefully impale the recording electrode into the muscle (Figure 4D).Stimulating the CM9 MNStimulate the CM9 at 0.5-5 V for 300 μsec. The observance of a presynaptic based action potential is confirmed by the observance of a distinct voltage threshold for EPSP appearance (Figure 6B).Generally, animals 7-35 days old have EPSPs amplitudes of ~9 mV (± 0.36) and ~12 mv (± 0.55) for 42 days old animals. mEPSP amplitudes remain relatively constant throughout the lifespan of the fly (~1.13 mV [± 0.43]) (see Mahoney et al., 2014 for complete values for 7-60 days old virgin females)."
