    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPlating 3D microfluidic chambers to measure somal and axonal Aβ\nIn these steps, we have used cell culture and cellular differentiation methods to seed and differentiate FAD hNPCs in microfluidic chamber slides to isolate somal and axonal Aβ. For this, we have used commercially available microfluidic chambers from Xona Microfluidics. We used the microfluidic chambers containing 150 μm capillaries connecting the somal and the axonal compartments. We have seeded FAD hNPCs in 3D into the groove on the somal side prior to differentiating the cells to allow axons extending along the capillaries into the grooves towards the axonal compartments. The method allowed prevention of cells remaining concentrated in the somal compartments without contaminating the axonal compartments with bulk neurons. As an additional step, we created a small volume change between the somal and axonal compartments by adding 180 μL media in each of the somal compartments, while adding 150 μL media in the axonal compartment 24 h before collecting the conditioned media for Aβ analyses.\nCritical: Change differentiation media every 3 days. For media changes, do not aspirate all media. Leave 20% of the media and replace the rest with fresh media to avoid cell death. For drug treatments, prepare the reagents at a concentration 1.25-fold than the required concentrations.\nPreparation of somal and axonal Aβ from FAD hNPCs differentiated in 3D microfluidic chambers\nThe steps to prepare differentiated FAD hNPCs in microfluidic chambers to separate axons from bulk neurons are as follows:\nTiming: 5 h\nPrecoat the chambers as described in the manufacturer’s (Xona) protocol (https://xonamicrofluidics.com/protocols/[href=https://xonamicrofluidics.com/protocols/]) as follows (Refer to Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]): [2 h]",
    "Pipette 100 μL of precoat (provided by the manufacturer) into the top left well of the microfluidics chamber (facing away from the hole leading to the middle chamber to avoid bubbles) to allow it to flow through the middle chamber.\nWait 1 min then add another 100 μL into the bottom left chamber.\nWait 5 min then repeat steps a and b with the right side of the chamber.\nAspirate off.\nRepeat steps a-d 2× only this time instead of using precoat use PBS to wash the chambers.\nRepeat steps a and b. This time use Matrigel solution (1:100 Matrigel to DMEM/F12) to coat the chambers.\nIncubate the slides at 37°C for 1 h for effective Matrigel-coating of the microfluidic chambers.\nGently aspirate the media using a pipette.\nNote: To avoid aspirating off Matrigel, do not use vacuum suction to aspirate.\nIf not immediately used, store the Matrigel-coated chambers inside a sealed container at 4°C. The chambers can be stored for maximum 1 month.\nPrepare cells for plating in the microfluidic chambers by following these steps: [3 h]\nAspirate media off a healthy plate of FAD hNPCs. (Note: we use FAD hNPCs. We plate cells (passage number 12 or less) in expansion media inside T-25 flasks and wait until the confluency reaches to 70%–80%.)\nWash cells with PBS as to remove any unwanted dead cells.\nAspirate off PBS and apply enough accutase to cover all the cells and place in 37°C CO2 (5%) incubator until cells are fully detached from the plate (around 2–3 min).\nNote: A T-25 flask only requires around 300 μL of accutase to detach cells. If cells stick you can lightly tap plates to help them fully detach.",
    "Dislodge the cells from the bottom of the dishes by gentle taps and resuspend the cells in 3 mL expansion media.\nTake 10 μL of the suspension and count the number of cells using a cell counter.\nTake appropriate number of cells (∼30,000 for each microfluidic device) and centrifuge at 500×g for 3 min.\nDiscard supernatant and collect the cell pellet.\nResuspend cell pellets in 30 uL prechilled differentiation media containing Matrigel at 1:10 ratio of media to Matrigel. Resuspend cells on ice and gently pipette 15 μL and add it in the top left well of microfluidics plate being sure to pipette it into the hole that leads to the middle chamber.\nNote: During step g, keep all solution on ice and use pre-chilled pipette tips during cell resuspension. Reference troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] for what to do if a bubble is visualized in between steps.\nRepeat steps g and h with the rest of 15 μL cell suspension on the lower left well of the somal compartment of the microfluidics plate again making sure the pipette is aimed towards the hole that leads to the somal grooves.\nWait 5 for min then place 150 μL of differentiation media into the top left corner of the microfluidics plate.\nWait 1 min then place 150 μL of differentiation media into the bottom left corner of the microfluidics plate.\nAfter waiting another 5 min repeat steps i and j for the right side (axonal compartments) of the microfluidics plate and place it in the 37°C CO2 (5%) incubator for 18 h.\nNext day exchange the media with fresh differentiation media and allow differentiation for 10 days. Add fresh differentiation media every 2–3 days with 150 μL media for each of the four chambers.",
    "Critical: While exchanging the media, do not replace all of the media. Leave 20% of the old media and exchange 80% of the old media with fresh media.\nDifferentiate the cells for 10 days by exchanging the media every 2-days.\nThe steps to collect conditioned media from axonal and somal compartment after 10-day differentiation of FAD hNPCs in microfluidic chambers:\nTiming: 25 h\n24 h before collecting the somal and axonal conditioned media (CM) for Aβ ELISA analysis, take the microfluidic chamber slides containing 10-day differentiated cells (step 2n) and add 180 μL media to the somal compartments and 150 μL media to the axonal compartments containing desired reagents (vehicle or 10 μM NE-100).\nCollect the CM to perform Aβ ELISA to measure Aβ40 level. (Note: we did not measure Aβ42 because the level of Aβ42 was undetectable in the axonal compartments.).\nCritical: After collecting the CM, immediately flash freeze the samples and store at −80°C freezer. Avoid freezing and thawing the samples to prevent Aβ degradation.\nUse 5 μL somal CM diluted in 50 μL dilution buffer (provided by the manufacturer) in for each well of the 96-well plate to measure somal Aβ40 level. To measure axonal Aβ level, use 50 μL of undiluted CM from the axonal compartments for each well of the Aβ ELISA plate.\nPerform ELISA according to the manufacturer’s (Wako) protocol ((https://labchem-wako.fujifilm.com/us/product/detail/W01W0129-6470.html[href=https://labchem-wako.fujifilm.com/us/product/detail/W01W0129-6470.html]) and (Takeda et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7])).\nCalculation of axonal and somal Aβ from 3D microfluidic chambers\nTiming: 4 h",
    "The key to measure Aβ from cell bodies and from axons is to calculate the number of axons generated from each capillary after 10-day differentiation of FAD hNPCs in the 3D-2D microfluidic chambers. We counted ∼300 axons per chambers from 30,000 cells seeded in the somal compartments (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C–1G). The steps to calculate the amount and the number of Aβ40 molecules per axon or per cell body is as follows:\nFirst calculate Aβ concentration (in pM) in the condition media from somal (bulk) and from axonal (axons) compartments employing the Wako Aβ ELISA assay (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2], Raw data) following the manufacturer’s protocol as described in step 6.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1291_9.csv\nTo calculate Aβ from only cell bodies follow this formula:\nConcentration of Aβ (in pM) from cell bodies alone = the bulk Aβ concentration (from 30,000 bulk neurons) in pM minus the pM concentration of the axonal Aβ multiplied by 30,000 (total cells plated) /333 (average number of axons counted).\nThis will provide the concentration of Aβ (in pM) from cell bodies alone. In our case we obtained approx. 380 pM Aβ from the bulk neuron containing 30,000 cells (somal compartment) and approx. 3.5 pM Aβ from the axonal compartment containing 333 axons. Based on this we measured that the axons in the somal compartments would contribute to 3.5 × 30,000/300 pM amount of Aβ, which was subtracted from the bulk neuron Aβ (∼380 pM). This gave us 30–140 pM Aβ from cell bodies alone (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1291_10.csv",
    "Calculate the total axonal Aβ amount (in picogram) following this formula: Total axonal Aβ (in picogram) = the concentration (pM) Aβ × molecular weight (4330 Dalton) × total volume (150 μL) divided by 106. Aβ amount can be presented in picogram. To present it as number of Aβ molecule, multiply the total pg amount with Avogadro’s number (6.22 × 1023) divided by 1012. This will give total number of Aβ molecules per axon. Multiply the data was by 10 to match the 10-times more axonal conditioned media compared to that of somal in the experiments (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]).\nCalculate total Aβ amount (in picogram) from bulk neurons in the somal compartment by following this formula: Total bulk neuronal Aβ (in pg) = the concentration (pM) Aβ from somal compartment × molecular weight (4330 Dalton) × total volume (180 μL) divided by 106.\nTo calculate total number of Aβ molecule per cell body, use the total pg of cell body Aβ amount obtained from step 9 and use the method from step 10\nPerform statistical analyses by Student’s t-test using Prism 9 software.\nNote: NE-100 treatment results in a severe loss of Aβ40 from axons. Therefore, Aβ40 released from cell bodies is nearly identical to Aβ40 released from bulk neurons.\nImmunostaining of differentiated FAD hNPCs in microfluidic chambers\nTiming: 36 h",
    "FAD-APP (APPSwe/lon) expressing hNPCs (FAD hNPCs) are generated by transfecting naïve hNPCs with IRES-mediated polycistronic lentiviral vectors encoding human APPSwe/lon with GFP as a reporter for viral infection. The fluorophore GFP in FAD hNPCs can be imaged directly because the fluorophore has provided a sufficiently strong signal (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). Immunocytochemistry is performed to detect endogenous or exogenously expressing cellular proteins. This is standard immunocytochemistry workflow for detecting fluorescent-labeled proteins (specifically Tau as a marker for axons) by labeling fixed cells with primary antibodies followed by secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorophores.\nFix the cells with 3% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 min at room temperature. 3% PFA is made in PBS containing calcium and magnesium.\nWash cells three-times with PBS.\nAdd Blocking Solution and incubate the cells for 1 h at room temperature.\nAdd primary antibody solutions and incubate the cells with primary antibodies for 16 h at 4°C. Use anti-Tau antibody at 1:1000 dilution to label axons for counting.\nWash the cells 3-times 5 min each with Washing Buffer.\nAdd secondary antibody at 1:250 dilution and incubate for 18 h at 4°C.\nWash the cover slips 3-times 5 min each with Washing Buffer.\nIf necessary, add 1:10,000 diluted (made in dH2O) solution of Hoechst to label nucleus.\nImmediately proceed to microscopy.\nWe use Nikon C2 Eclipse Ti2 inverted confocal microscope to capture fluorescent images using NIS Element AR software.\nConvert the images to photoshop images (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).",
    "Critical: Counting the number of axons by eye may results in errors. Because the axons are growing inside 3D matrix, while counting adjust the focus using fine adjustment to look at different planes. While counting axonal Aβ, we followed the methods described by Niederst et al. (2015)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] with one exception. We only counted the number of axons sprouting from the tip of the capillaries. Use model cells similar to FAD hNPCs that produce significant level of Aβ so that would be sufficient to calculate axonal Aβ even by counting only the axons extending out of the capillaries separating the somal and the axonal compartments. In our case, we obtain ∼333 axons per microfluidic chamber.\nIn-house microfluidic chamber slides preparation\nThis section lists the major bioengineering steps to manufacture the microfluidic chamber slides used for collecting pure axons from bulk neurons after axotomy. Our laboratory is equipped with a contamination-free room that is essential to manufacture the devices with precision.\nFabricating microfluidic chambers\nAll designs can be generated using AutoCad software. To our knowledge, no reliable alternative software for designing a similar microfluidic chamber is commercially available. An overview of the fabrication process is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1291-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.
