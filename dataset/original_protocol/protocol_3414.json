    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nFormation of the membraneless compartment\nTiming: 1 h\nIn this protocol we focus on the formation of stress granule compartments using sodium arsenite (Farny et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). Other membraneless compartments can require different conditions, e.g., heat stress for the protein quality control compartments (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B) (Hill et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19], Spokoini et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib34]). Yet others are constitutive, e.g., P bodies (Rao and Parker, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib29], Luo et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]). Thus, you can substitute this step with the specific conditions.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/318-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Confocal microscopy of the tracking of the photoconverted pool of proteins inside the stress granule.\nNote: This protocol can be used for a comparative analysis, thus the user can form the compartment in different conditions with the same treatment, or with different treatments.\nReplace the media in the glass-bottom plate for live-cell imaging with the stress granule induction solution (200 μM arsenite in the media) and incubate for 1 h in the cell culture incubator at 37°C/5% CO2.\nNote: One can use the media in the wells and just mix it thoroughly with the arsenite and carefully pour it back in the well. Avoid starving the cells, as this will cause stress granule formation (Reineke et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib30]), a freshly split cells should be used. Alternatively change the media to a fresh media before the experiment. We do not recommend introducing media perturbations before the experiment.\nIntroduce the plate into a live-cell imaging chamber of the microscope preheated to 37°C.\nPhotoconvert a portion of the membraneless compartment",
    "Timing: 5 min initial setup, 5 s for the photoconversion\nPhotoactivation, changing the excitation/emission spectra of a fluorescent protein using irradiation, is used in a variety of microscopic techniques. The photoswitching mechanisms often involve light induced trans/cis isomerization of the chromophore resulting in a red shift or activation of the spectra (Chudakov et al., 2007b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9], Habuchi et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]). Reversible and irreversible photoactivation are techniques used in super resolution approaches, such as PALM (Betzig et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5], Andresen et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2], Cho et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]), irreversible photoconversion of Dendra2 is used for photolabeling and tracking of proteins over extended periods of time (Chudakov et al., 2007a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8], Chudakov et al., 2007b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). Some fluorescent proteins can be turned on from a non-fluorescent state, known as kindling, while others shift their excitation/emission spectra upon irradiation (Chudakov et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). Photoconversion of Dendra2 induces a red shift of fluorescence emission and excitation maxima after irradiation with a short pulse of a lower wavelength light, e.g., 406 nm. Photoconverted protein can thus be detected separately and simultaneously with a non-photoconverted pool of proteins (Chudakov et al., 2007a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8], Zhang et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib37]). Photoswitching of Dendra2 is irreversible and thus can be used to track protein diffusion and protein degradation (Zhang et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib37], Gura Sadovsky et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16], Chudakov et al., 2007a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). The goal here is to irreversibly photoconvert a small portion (<half) of the membraneless compartment.\nPrepare the setup for the photoconversion of stress granule compartment\nZoom in on to the cell, that stress granule compartment is clearly visible and in the center of view. We use maximal zoom 8 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nPosition the photoactivation point on the stress granule, if cell moves you can generally manually adjust it at the beginning of imaging.",
    "Note: Make sure the digital point is aligned with the actual photoconversion position. If not contact the technician to realign the system or adjust it manually using the software.\nSet the photoconversion parameters: laser power, the timing of the pulse, the number of pulses, the onset of the pulse. We set the following parameters: manual initiation of the photoconversion, pulse duration, 100 ms; number of pulses, manually curated.\nNote: The parameters should be optimized for your system and will depend on the SNR and the power of the laser.\nPhotoconvert the portion of a stress granule by starting the acquisition and initiating the photoconversion. Visualize both pre-photoconversion (488 nm excitation) and post-photoconversion (561 nm excitation) channels during the acquisition (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C, Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nNote: Use lowest resolution to minimize the bleaching, the goal is to photoconvert a part of the compartment fast.\nNote: Even though we acquire a 2D acquisition during photoconversion and photoconvert a single point, we still photoconvert a volume of the stress granule, thus when tracking a small change in Z position will not affect the data (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nCritical: It is important to use the same photoconversion parameters and timing of the acquisition between repeats and conditions. If it is not possible to control it manually, set a protocol in the system: photoconversion in 1 s after the start of the movie (allows you to record a pre-photoconverted state), pulse of 200 ms, duration of the acquisition 5 s.\nTrack the diffusion\nTiming: 15 min to 1 h (the timing depends on the diffusion rate of your protein within the compartment, and the compartment state)",
    "In this step we will track the photoconverted proteins diffuse within the compartment over time. This step should immediately follow the photoconversion with a less than 5–10 s interval between the end of photoconversion and the beginning of tracking.\nSet up a 2D time-lapse, acquiring an image every 1 minute for 15 min. Use the same position and magnification that was used for the photoconversion. Start the movie immediately after the end of the photoconversion (Troubleshooting 3).\nNote: We do not recommend continuous acquisition from the photoconversion due to the bleaching of the fluorescent protein. Photoconversion is done with a 30 frames per second rate, while the movie will only take 16 frames in 15 min, drastically reducing the bleaching. Also, it allows to utilize a slower higher-resolution imaging for the movie (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C and 4E).\nNote: Steps 1–6, from the formation/treatment of the membraneless compartment to photoconversion and tracking, are repeated N times for each treatment. To generate sufficient data for the calculations. After the first run and establishing the critical parameters for photoconversion and the duration of the tracking movie necessary to visualize the diffusion, the pipeline can be established, for example for a solidified stress granule compartment (which does not diffuse, manuscript in preparation) or the IPOD (yeast protein quality control compartment) (Kaganovich et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]) we photoconvert 10 compartments, save the positions, and start a tracking movie for 10 points at the same time. For a faster diffusing stress granules (within 10 min) it is recommended to handle them one at a time repeating photoconversion-tracking step within a certain timeframe, for example 45 min after 1-h treatment for each condition.\nPause Point: The movies can be analyzed immediately or at a later stage when sufficient data points are collected from all the treatments.",
    "Quantify the diffusion time\nTiming: 5 min for one movie\nIn this step we will use the tracking movies that were acquired in the previous step to quantify the diffusion of the protein across the stress granule compartment. For that we will use the NIS Elements Software (Nikon) to calculate the fluorescence intensity of the area of photoconversion and an equivalent adjacent area over time.\nQuantify the fluorescence intensity of the photoconverted area and the immediately adjacent area along the long axis of the stress granule over the time of the movie (Troubleshooting 2), from 0 to 15 min (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nNote: Diffusion time of the protein of interest across the membraneless compartment is the time it takes equalize the fluorescence intensity (5% margin) between the photoconverted area and the adjacent area of the same volume. The diffusion time often corresponds to a complete diffusion across the membraneless compartments (equalizing of the fluorescence of the photoconverted protein pool), however there are cases of elongated compartments where it does not.\nDetermine the diffusion time of the protein by plotting the line graphs of photoconverted and adjacent areas over time (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nNote: we use a rather poor time resolution (±1 min), which is justified by two considerations. First, we reduce the bleaching, acquiring only 16 frames in 15 min. Second, there are cases of solidifications that increase the time of diffusion to 1 h, thus we do not need a resolution on a second’s scale. If, however, you are dealing with a fast-diffusing compartment (under a minute), or desire a higher resolved comparison, adjust the time-lapse parameters in step 5. For a higher resolved movie consider correcting for bleaching.",
    "Note: Using our parameters, the bleaching correction, although improves the data visuals, does not change the diffusion time. However, if increasing the time resolution, or dealing with a longer time-lapse (more frames) we recommend running the bleaching time-lapse with a fully photoconverted membraneless compartment (in addition to step 5) and correcting the data."
