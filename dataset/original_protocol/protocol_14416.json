    "The procedures carried out in the video and described below have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Miami University.\n1. Preparation and Stimulus Test\nEstablish two distinct areas for the surgical procedure, the operating table and the post-operation table. Stage both areas with all materials and utensils necessary.\n\t\nStage the operating table under a vented hood. Arrange the table with the equipment in a manner that allows the continuous and unimpeded performance of the procedure.\nEstablish a postoperative table in the same room and near the main table of operation. Maintain both tables as sterile environments throughout the procedure.\nPlace the following supplies on the operating table: one glass jar with lid, one 15 mL tube, one pair of surgical scissors, one squeeze bottle of 70% ethanol, two foam boards, two forceps, two 1 mL 21 gauge syringes, two 50 mL tubes, one centrifuge tube, one cryogenic vial, four surgical pads, ten pins, a dispenser of sterilizing wipes, and a sharps container.\nPlace the following supplies on the post-operation table: one analytical balance, one 4 L dewar of liquid nitrogen, a shallow wide mouth dewar, a floating microtube rack, one pair of surgical scissors, two forceps, four cryogenic vials, and a dispenser of sterile wipes.\nFill one 50 mL and one 15 mL tube to 75% volume with formalin.\nUsing a pin in each corner, affix one surgical pad to an approximate 30 cm x 30 cm foam board to serve as the dissection board. Use the remaining four pins during the operation. Prepare a smaller foam board with a surgical pad to transfer the organs to the post-op table.",
    "CAUTION: Isoflurane (99.9%) is a toxic chemical, and should be used in a vent hood to ensure the maximum level of safety from the scavenging of waste anesthetic gas8. Additional information regarding the risks to researchers associated with the use of the open-drop method using isoflurane can be found in an article by Taylor and Mook8.\nPlace one surgical pad into the glass jar and soak with a few drops of isoflurane (99.9%) and place a paper towel over the top to prevent direct contact of the mouse with the isoflurane. Similarly, use a surgical pad to line the remaining tube and soak with a few drops of isoflurane and place an additional pad over the top to prevent direct contact between the mouse and the isoflurane.\nPour liquid nitrogen into the shallow wide mouth dewar until the maximum fill line is reached.\nPlace the mouse selected for dissection into the anesthesia chamber, i.e. the glass jar with a pad soaked with a few drops of isoflurane (99.9%) covered with the lid, for ~1 min.\n\tNOTE: This time varies from mouse to mouse. Once the mouse is unconscious, remove it from the chamber and place it onto the operating board.\nOrient the mouse so that it is lying ventral side up and with its head pointed away from the scientist. Place the head inside the tube lined with a surgical pad soaked with a few drops of isoflurane (99.9%), and perform a stimulus test by a foot pinch to ensure that the mouse is unresponsive to stimuli.\n\t\nIf this test fails and the mouse responds to the foot pinch test, repeat step 1.8.\n2. Initial Incision, Heart Puncture, and Euthanasia",
    "Pin the limbs of the mouse to the surgical foam board and wet the ventral side of the mouse with 70% ethanol.\nPinch the fur/skin near the urethral opening with forceps and pull slightly upwards. Make an incision with the surgical scissors through the abdominal cavity starting from the urethral opening, up the midline and ending at the chin.\n\t\nNear the starting point of the initial incision, grab one side of the fur/skin with the forceps and make another incision with the scissors downward and diagonally towards the back paw.\nRepeat this in the same manner on the opposite side.\n\t\tNOTE: The fur/skin may be pinned down to create a wider opening, but is not necessary.\nLocate the heart and remove the pericardium, which is the sac around the heart, to avoid clogging of the syringe needle.\n\t\nGrasp the pericardium with the forceps and cut it with the scissors. Perform the heart puncture by carefully inserting the syringe needle into the beating heart and slowly start to retract the plunger.\nFor optimal blood collection, use the plunger of the needle to mimic the pumping action of the heart and avoid drawing too quickly.\n\t\tNOTE: Typically about 1 mL of blood can be collected.\nAfter completing the blood collection, dispel the blood into the centrifuge tube and dispose of the syringe into the sharps container.\nAfter the heart puncture is performed, carry out euthanasia by removing the attachments connecting the heart.\n\t\tNOTE: Heparin, an anti-coagulant, was not added to the syringe in this procedure prior to the heart puncture to allow the blood to coagulate for serum collection in this specific study. However, if the researcher wanted to prevent blood coagulation to collect plasma, heparin could be added to the syringe prior to the heart puncture.",
    "If the study involves genotyping of the mouse, snip a portion of the ear with the scissors and place into a centrifuge tube for a genotype verification.\n3. Pancreas Extraction\nLocate the stomach on the left side of the mouse. Begin gently (so as to avoid tearing) separating the pancreas from the stomach and duodenum by using two forceps.\n\tNOTE: When detaching the pancreas from the stomach and intestines, it is very important that the forceps are used gently to guide the pancreas tissue away from the organs and to not crush or tear the pancreas with the forceps.\n\t\nContinue to separate the pancreas from the small intestine jejunum and ileum sections, and lastly from the caecum of the large intestine.\nAt the caecum, reposition the forceps and continue separation of the pancreas along the remaining colon towards the rectum.\n\tNOTE: At this point, it is convenient to cut and remove the portion from the stomach to the region of the colon immediately preceding the rectum.\nLocate the pancreas and attached spleen. Slide the pancreas towards the right side of the mouse. Separate the remaining connections between the pancreas and thoracic cavity with the forceps to fully detach the pancreas and adjoined spleen.\nRemove the pancreas and spread it out for examination. Leave the spleen attached to the pancreas for identification purposes.\n\t\nRemove all connective tissue, fat and mesenteric tissue from the pancreas.",
    "NOTE: This tissue is whiter in color and thus can be easily distinguished from the pancreas tissue that is pinker in color. This is particularly important if the whole pancreas needs to be removed. For example, if the pancreas needs to be weighed and compared to body weight or between groups of animals. In the Ptf1acre/+;LSL-KrasG12D/+ mouse model, specifically in the older months, hard fibrous pancreatic tissue could be present. In this case, careful removal of the pancreas must be conducted as the intestines could be interlaced in tumor tissue. In advanced cases, abnormal spleen and liver tissue may also be present.\nIf desired, remove other organs at this point.\n4. Data Collection and Storage\nAfter extraction of the organs, move the samples to the postoperative area for preservation.\nWeigh each organ and place them into their respective cryogenic vial.\n\tNOTE: Along with the mass of each sample, any irregularities should be recorded for future reference.\nOnce the organs are weighed, place them into the liquid nitrogen for snap freezing.\nAfter snap freezing, store the organs at -80 째C for long-term storage.\nPlace the formalin stored samples on the bench top overnight, and the next morning change their solution from formalin to 70% ethanol.\n\tNOTE: These samples should be stored at 4 째C for long-term storage.\nFor long term storage, freeze the blood and ear punch at -80 째C.. For serum collection from the blood, allow the blood to coagulate for 30 min then centrifuge it. Remove the serum portion using a pipette and then store at -80 째C.\n5. Clean Up",
    "Sanitize all the dissection tools with the sterilizing wipes. Cap the tube lined with the isoflurane soaked surgical pad. Replace the surgical pad on the foam board with a fresh surgical pad. Dispose the portions of the mouse that were not collected per the facility's animal disposal policy.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
