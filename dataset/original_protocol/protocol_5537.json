    "Note: This part is modified from Desmond, 1965. Double fixationPre-fixation: 4-6 pieces of 1-2 x 2-4 mm fresh leaf tissues are put into a 1.5-ml microtube filled with 0.5-1.0 ml of 2% glutaraldehyde-0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (see Recipes) for 1-2 h, and then, the tubes are placed in a vacuum desiccator for 1-2 h.A visual check is performed to ensure that the leaf discs sink to the bottom. After pre-fixation, the fixing solution is removed with a Pasteur pipet and transferred to a waste storage bottle. Using a new Pasteur pipet, 1-2 ml of K-phosphate washing buffer (see Recipes) is added into the microtube with the leaf discs. The leaves are washed for 10 min while shaking the tube gently by hand. While shaking, care is taken to prevent the leaves from getting dry. This washing is repeated 6 times. Post-fixation: the tissues are fixed with 2% osmium tetroxide (OsO4) (see Recipes) at 4 °C for 1 h.DehydrationThe tissues are dehydrated with a series of solutions containing increasing concentrations of ethanol–50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% and 95%–with rotation for 15 to 30 min. Subsequently, the tissues are dehydrated with 100% ethanol (see Recipes) for 60 min, 3 times, with shaking.SubstitutionThe tissues are permeated twice with 100% propylene oxide for 15 min.To increase the concentration of epoxy resin gradually, the tissue is infiltrated into 7:3, 5:5, and 3:7 mixed solutions of propylene oxide and epoxy resin, for 60 min each time.Finally, the tissue is infiltrated into the pure epoxy resin for 60 min.Resin embedding and hardeningThe silicon embedding plate is filled with pure epoxy resin and the tissues are placed in the resin.The blocks of epoxy resin are hardened by heat in the program-controlled incubator.",
    "Note: The heat program starts at 35 °C for 8 h, rises to 45 °C for 8 h, and then heats at 60 °C for 48 h.Preparation of specimen for light microscopyThe epoxy resin block is attached to an ultra-microtome and cut with a glass knife to obtain 3-μm thick sections.Using tweezers, a section is placed on a glass slide where a drop of distilled water has been placed.The glass slide is dried at 60-70 °C on a hotplate.After drying, the tissue is stained a with 1% toluidine blue staining solution while warming for 60 sec.After washing with water and drying, desired portions of tissues sample are selected by optical microscopy.TrimmingThe sample is trimmed again under a stereoscopic microscope to an ultrathin section size of approximately 0.5 x 0.5 mm, which includes the site to be observed.The ultrathin section size of the specimen to be observed by electron microscopy is smaller than the that of the optical microscopy specimen, and the section size depends on the blade width of the diamond knife. The minimum width size of optical microscopy specimens is 25 mm, while the maximum size of electron microscopy specimens is 3 mm. Therefore, it is necessary to select and re-trim the site for observation from the optical microscope specimen to use it for electron microscopy.Ultrathin section preparation (Williams and Carter, 2009)The re-trimmed epoxy resin block is attached to the ultra-microtome, and the knife is changed from a glass knife to a diamond one. The parallax is readjusted because of the change in parallelism between the block and the knife.After adjusting the parallelism, the re-trimmed epoxy resin block is sliced with the diamond knife. The feed volume and cutting speed of the ultra-microtome are used to adjust the thickness.",
    "Ultrathin sections made by the diamond knife are collected on water. The thickness of the ultrathin section is set to 100 nm.The thin sections floating on the water in the diamond knife boat are transferred to the grid.Extra water is wiped off with filter paper, and the grids are placed into a Petri dish.Staining for electron microscopyThe ultrathin section grid is attached to the contact tape of a stick stain holder. The stick stain holder is immersed for 10 min in a centrifuge tube filled with 1% uranyl acetate solution.The stick stain holder is placed in a beaker filled with distilled water.The grids on the stick stain holder are washed in 3 changes of water.After washing, the stick stain holder is wiped with filter paper.The stick stain holder is immersed into a lead citrate solution for 5 min.The stick stain holder is placed in a beaker filled with distilled water.After washing, the stick stain holder is wiped with filter paper.Carbon coatingCarbon coating has the effect of preventing damage caused by electron beam irradiation to ultrathin sections during electron microscopic observation.The sample is placed in the carbon vacuum evaporator. The carbon layer thickness is set to 20 nm.Note: Procedure A-I is summarized in Figure 5.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171130/20171130232008_0205.jpgFigure 5. Ultrathin section preparation and staining. Fresh 1-2 x 2-4 mm leaf tissues are cut to a size of approximately 1 mm with a razor and placed in a 1.5-ml microtube (A), epoxy resin blocks are trimmed in preparation for ultrathin sectioning and then sectioned on an ultra-microtome (B). Ultrathin sections from the diamond knife are collected on water. The thin, sliced sections floating on the water in the diamond knife boat are picked up and transferred to the grid (C).",
    "Electron microscopic staining: The grid with the ultrathin sections grid is attached to the contact tape of a stick stain holder, which is then immersed for 10 min into a centrifuge tube filled with 1% uranyl acetate solution and for 5 min into lead citrate solution (D).Transmission electron microscopic observationsFor electron microscopy, low- and high-magnification observations are carried out using JEM 1400.Observation data are recorded and stored by the Gatan CCD camera and Digital Microscopy software (Figure 6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171130/20171130232206_8159.jpgFigure 6.
