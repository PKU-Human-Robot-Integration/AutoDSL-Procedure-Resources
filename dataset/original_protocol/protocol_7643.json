    "Based on the GFF annotation files of each genome, the redundant transcripts and short genes are removed by TBtools: (a) the longest transcript of each gene is retained to remove redundancy resulting from alternative splicing variations (detailed steps are briefly displayed in Video 1); (b) protein sequences length of genes is calculated by TBtools, and sequences shorter than 50 amino acids are manually filtered.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Removing the redundant transcripts by TBtoolsIdentifying orthologous genes within large-scale genomic/transcriptomic data Identifying candidate homologs from genomes.In order to identify candidate homologs of Arabidopsis thaliana HLS1 (AtHLS1), we conducted similarity searches with relative stringency threshold (E value < 1 × 10-5) against the protein sequences of plant genomes. For genomic data, the relative stringency threshold (E value < 1 × 10-5) is used, and the reasons include: (1) gene annotation of genomic data is based on multiple evidences (such as gene database and transcriptomic data), which ensured the completeness and quality of gene sequences; (2) the genomic data in this study is mainly derived from the Phytozome (https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/[href=https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/]) and has high qualities.

The reason includes the intrinsic incompleteness of transcriptomes resulting from alternative splicing and premature termination. The detailed steps are briefly displayed in Video 2.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. BLASTp for AtHLS1 at the 1KP website Filtering sequences with blast-hits.Candidate homologs from both genomes and transcriptomes are integrated into a single fasta file (ID_sequences.",
    "fa), and InterProScan database is used to filter homologous sequences without a conserved functional domain: N-acetyltransferase (PF00583). Consolidate the homologous sequences with “N-acetyltransferase” domain into a new fasta file (PF00583_ID_sequences.fa) for further phylogenetic analyses.Interproscan.sh -i ID_sequences.fa -f tsv -appl Pfam -o interproscan_ID_sequences.txt Orthologs inference with phylogenetic analyses Alignment and trimming of homologous sequences.Homologous sequences are aligned by MAFFT using the following command:mafft PF00583_ID_sequences.fa > mafft_out.fa Note: An alignment of up to ~200 sequences × ~2,000 sites is suitable for an accurate option (L-INS-i), and an alignment of <~30,000 sequences is suitable for fast option (FFT-NS-2). TrimAl is a widely used tool for automated alignment trimming in large-scale phylogenetic analyses. Before trimming, we perform manual inspection for sequence alignment using Jalview and exclude one sequence (in red rectangle) for its error alignment (Figure 2). We use a relatively relaxed threshold (‘-gt=0.13’: retaining columns that have at least 13% gap-free sites for keeping as much informative sites of conserved domains as possible) for trimming multiple sequence alignment (MSA). The trimmed MSA is further visually inspected to (1) filter the obvious ambiguously aligned regions and (2) retain the regions of functional domains, ensuring a greater proportion of reliably phylogenetically informative sites.trimal -in mafft_out.fa -out mafftout_0.13.fas -gt 0.13 imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4893/bioprotoc-13-23-4893-g002.jpgFigure 2. Multiple sequence alignment of AtHLS1 and its homologs. We empirically focused on the alignment region of conserved domains and found an obvious sequence that is poorly aligned (no amino acid residue was aligned).Constructing a phylogenetic tree of homologous proteins.The maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of homologous proteins is inferred using IQ-TREE 2, and the best-fitting model is determined by ModelFinder. Branch supports are evaluated by the ultrafast bootstrap (UFBoot) approach and SH approximate likelihood ratio test (SH-aLRT test) with 1,000 replicates.iqtree2 -s mafftout_0.13.fas -st AA -m MF iqtree2 -s mafftout_0.13.fas -m Q.",

The parameter “number of motifs expected to be found” is set to ten (a common setting for this parameter) and other parameters are as default. Corresponding functional domains and motifs of each orthologous sequence are mapped to the phylogenetic tree using iTOL (Video 3). Two conserved residues (L327 and E346 in AtHLS1) are checked and highlighted in the MSA. Both the conserved functional domains/motifs and residues are used for the confirmation of orthologous sequence (Figure 3).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 3.
