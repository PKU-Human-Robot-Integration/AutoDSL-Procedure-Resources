    "Overview\nSteps 1 – 9: Maintenance of hPSCs\nSteps 10 – 22: Induction of IM cells by embryoid body \\(EB) formation \\(EB method)\nSteps 23 – 29: Induction of IM cells by colony formation \\(Colony method)\nSteps 30 – 40: Induction of IM cells with single cell dissociation \\(Single cell method)\nMaintenance of hPSCs\nPreparation of SNL feeder cells\n1. Partially thaw the frozen vial of mitotically inactivated SNL feeder cells in 37 °C water bath, resuspend the 1 ml cell solution in 10 ml DMEM/10 % FBS medium, and spin down at approximately 160 g for 5 min.\n  2. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 10 ml DMEM/10 % FBS medium.\n  3. Plate the cell suspension onto gelatin-coated plates at a density of approximately 50,000 cells/cm2 and incubate overnight.\n  Passage of hPSCs\n4. Remove differentiated hPSCs using aseptic technique.\n  5. Aspirate old hPSC medium from plate, wash with 5 ml PBS \\(-), and add warm CTK dissociation solution \\(1 ml/10cm plate).\n  6. Incubate at 37 °C for 3 min.\n  7. Wash out SNLs twice with 5 ml PBS \\(-).\n  8. Harvest the hPSC colonies in 5 ml fresh hPSC medium by using a cell scraper.\n  9. Pipette and triturate the hPSC colonies in hPSC medium using P1000 pipetman and split onto new feeder cells at a ratio between 1:3 and 1:6.\n  \nInduction of IM cells by embryoid body \\(EB) formation \\(EB method)\n10. Repeat steps 4 – 7.\n  11. Add 5 ml hPSC medium and scrape hPSCs off the surface with a cell scraper, then pipet the cells up and down 5-10 times using P1000 pipetman.\n  12. Plate the suspension onto gelatin-coated plate and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min to remove SNLs.",
    "13. Transfer the hPSC cell solution to 15ml tube and allow cells to settle via gravity.\n  14. Remove the supernatant and resuspend with 10 ml Stage 1 medium, then allow cells to settle via gravity.\n  15. Remove the supernatant and resuspend with 8 ml Stage 1 medium containing 100 ng/ml recombinant human/mouse/rat activin A and 100 ng/ml recombinant mouse Wnt3a or 3 μM CHIR99021.\n  16. Distribute the cell suspension into a low attachment 6-well plate \\(2 ml/well) to form EB. Culture at 37 °C for 2 days.\n  17. Transfer the EB solution to a 15ml tube and allow EBs to settle via gravity.\n  18. Remove the supernatant and resuspend with 10 ml Stage 2 medium, then allow cells to settle via gravity.\n  19. Remove the supernatant and resuspend with 8 ml Stage 2 medium containing 100 ng/ml recombinant human BMP7 and 100 ng/ml recombinant mouse Wnt3a or 3 μM CHIR99021.\n  20. Transfer the cell solution onto a gelatin-coated 6-well plate \\(2 ml/well).\n  21. Change medium with BMP7 and Wnt3a or CHIR99021 every 2 - 3 days and culture at 37 °C for 4 - 20 days.\n  \nInduction of IM cells by colony formation \\(Colony method)\n22. Repeat steps 10 – 14.\n  23. Remove the supernatant, resuspend with 12 ml SNL-conditioned hPSC medium containing 10 ng/ml recombinant human bFGF and seed on Matrigel-coated 24-well plate \\(500 μl/well).\n  24. Grow the cells until hPSC colonies reach approximately 70% confluency.\n  25. Aspirate the medium and wash twice with PBS \\(-).\n  26. Add Stage 1 medium containing 100 ng/ml recombinant human/mouse/rat activin A and 100 ng/ml recombinant mouse Wnt3a or 3 μM CHIR99021 \\(500 μl/well) and culture at 37 °C for 2 days.\n  27. Aspirate the medium and wash with Stage 2 medium.",
    "28. Add Stage 2 medium containing 100 ng/ml recombinant human BMP7 and 100 ng/ml recombinant mouse Wnt3a or 3 μM CHIR99021 \\(500 μl/well).\n  29. Change medium with BMP7 and Wnt3a or CHIR99021 every 2 - 3 days and culture for 8 days.\n  \nInduction of IM cells with single cell dissociation \\(Single cell method)\n30. Repeat steps 4 – 7.\n  31. Add 2 ml warm Accutase.\n  32. Incubate at 37 °C for 6 min.\n  33. Pipet and dissociate the hPSC colonies into single cells using P1000 pipetman.\n  34. Add 8 ml Stage 1 medium and pipet the cells up and down using P1000 pipetman.\n  35. Count the cell number.\n  36. Transfer the hPSC cell solution to 15ml tube and spin down at 160 g for 5 min.\n  37. Remove the supernatant and resuspend with Stage 1 medium containing 100 ng/ml recombinant human/mouse/rat activin A, 100 ng/ml recombinant mouse Wnt3a or 3 μM CHIR99021, and 10 μM Y27,632 at a density of 6.0 X 105 cells/ml.\n  38.
