When PLpro cleaves AMC peptide to produce AMC, a fluorescence signal is generated and can be measured (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). First, checkerboard assay analysis is used to determine the optimal enzyme (PLpro) and substrate (peptide-linked AMC) concentration. Then, the determined optimal concentration is used to perform the enzyme assay in a 384-well plate format. This protocol can be adjusted for the use of other proteins by changing the sequence of the substrate.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2682-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.
