    "All animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Ethical clearance number PZSHUTCM190308020).\n1. Fabrication of the high platform\nSet the length and width of the supporting device to 86 cm x 17 cm (Figure 1).\nFix the connecting device vertically to the supporting device. The connecting device should be approximately 30 cm long to prevent the rat from running to the top surface of the high platform and have a width of 14 cm.\nFix the horizontal pedal (5 cm x 5 cm) to the connecting device. The suspended height at the bottom of the horizontal pedal should be greater than or equal to 50 cm.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the number of experimental rats, multiple horizontal pedals can be used, with one rat placed on each pedal.\n2. Establishment of a rat model of asthma\nSensitizing the rats with OVA\n\t\nPrepare the sensitization solution on day 0. Prepare each 1 mL of the sensitization solution with 1 mg of OVA and 10 mg of aluminum hydroxide, with normal saline as the solvent.\nIntraperitoneally inject each rat with 1 mL of the sensitization solution on day 0. Draw the sensitizing solution with a suitable syringe for later use.\nGrab the tail and lift up the rat, place it on a rough surface, and gently pull the tail back. Grasp the skin of both ears and neck with the left thumb and index finger while tightly holding the back skin with the remaining three fingers and palms (be careful to refrain from applying excess force that will suffocate the rat).\nWith the right hand, perform an intraperitoneal injection in the rat with the prepared syringe with 1 mL of the sensitization solution.\nChallenging rats with OVA",
    "Select a box with a lid (the length, width and height are 39 cm x 28 cm x 23 cm), and drill a small hole in the side. Connect the sealed box, nebulizing cup and the compression nebulizer with a rubber tube (Supplementary Figure 1).\n\t\tNOTE: The nebulized particle size of the compressed nebulizer is 1 - 5 μm, the nebulization rate is greater than 0.2 mL/min, and the ultimate pressure is 205 kPa.\nOn the 14th day after sensitization, open the lid of the homemade sealed box and place the rat in the box (the box can accommodate 5 rats), and then put the sealed box in a biosafety cabinet.\nPrepare the challenge solution. Thoroughly mix 300 mg of OVA with 30 mL of normal saline.\nTurn on the ultrasonic nebulizer and add 30 mL of the challenge solution into the nebulizing cup. Adjust the dosage of challenge solution and the number of rats according to the volume of the homemade sealed box.\nRepeat nebulization several times (once a day) or adjust the procedure according to the severity of asthma symptoms.\n3. Acupuncture treatment\nSelect acupoints, including GV14, bilateral BL12 and bilateral BL13, according to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine for treating asthma (Supplementary Figure 2). Administer manual acupuncture on day 2 and perform once every other day for a total of 7 session (Figure 2).\nAcupuncture the GV14 located between the seventh cervical vertebra and the first thoracic vertebra (the hollow of the scapula), on the midline of the back (Figure 3).\nAcupuncture the BL13 located below the third thoracic vertebra, on both sides of the intercostal spaces (lower edge of the scapula).\nAcupuncture the BL12 located below the second thoracic vertebra, on both sides of the intercostal spaces (below the scapula, position identified according to BL13).",
    "Grasp the rats and place them on the high platform.\nHold the disposable stainless-steel needle (0.3 mm x 13.0 mm, Supplementary Figure 3) handle with the thumb and index finger of the right hand, and press the back of the rat with the palm of the right hand.\n\tNOTE: Disposable needles must be one-time-use only. Because repeated use will blunt the needle, which leads to increased pain in rats.\nTouch the depression in the middle of the upper edge (GV14) or the lower edge of the scapula (BL12 and BL13), and then gently prick the skin of the rat with the needle tip to locate the acupoints.\nQuickly insert the needle after determining the specific location of the acupoint and rapidly remove the right hand.\nEvenly twisted the needles approximately 360° at a rate of 60 times/min for 10 - 20 s, manipulate them every 5 min, and then withdraw them after 20 - 30 min (Supplementary Figure 4).\n4. The Penh measurement\nPrepare methacholine: Place 100 mg of methacholine into a 5 mL centrifuge tube and add PBS to a volume of 2 mL (50 mg/mL methacholine). Then, dilute the 50 mg/mL methacholine solution to 25 mg/mL, 12.5 mg/mL, 6.25 mg/mL and 3.125 mg/mL.\nInstrument inspection\n\t\nTurn on the signal amplifier (the aerosol distribution system and the rodent bias flow supply system are all turned off, and the nebulization connector is closed).\nCheck the channels: Click Calibrate, return the coarse adjustment baseline to 0 and switch to the direct current (DC) position. Fine-tune the baseline to 0 and inject 5 mL of gas with a syringe. Then, switch to the alternating current (AC) position.\nAfter checking the channels, ensure that the error value is less than 0.5%.\nSetting parameters",
    "Turn on the aerosol distribution system and the rodent bias flow supply system. Adjust the flow rate to 4.5 mL according to the liquid level on the mercury ball.\nClick Create Study Options and select Dose Response Study, select Rat of species and click Next.\nSelect Simple Dose List, set the Number of Doses to 6 and click Next.\nSelect the Penh and Area parameters: Set the animal adaptation time to 5 min, the nebulization time to 2 min, the response time to 3 min, and the recovery time to 2 min.\nSequentially add the following solutions to the nebulizer (200 μL per rat): methacholine (0 mg/mL, 3.125 mg/mL, 6.25 mg/mL, 12.5 mg/mL, 25 mg/mL and 50 mg/mL). Real-time changes in Penh can be observed (Figure 4).\nAfter all 6 solutions with different concentrations have been reacted, click File and End Session to complete the experiment.\nSubscription Required.
