    "Two days before the LPS intraperitoneal injection, place mice in the anesthesia machine and once the mice are anesthetized shave abdominal area with a trimmer, as fur quenches the luminescence signal (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160923/20160923034459_8094.jpgFigure 1. A representative picture of mice under anesthesia getting their abdominal area shaved with a trimmerWeigh mice.In the day of the experiment dilute LPS in DPBS and prepare syringes for injection.Intraperitoneally inject mice with 2.5 mg/kg of LPS or the same volume DPBS for the control group (injection volume approximately 200 μl). 3 h later intraperitoneally inject mice with 200 mg/kg of XenoLight Rediject inflammation probe or 200 mg/kg luminol sodium salt (injection volume approximately 200 μl).Place mice in the IMPAC6 anesthesia chamber attached to the IVIS spectrum. Transfer mice to the IVIS spectrum and place mice abdomen facing up into the chamber and position each nose inside the cone that delivers the isofluorane (Figure 2).Start imaging anesthetized mice 10 min post XenoLight Rediject inflammation probe injection with a 5 min exposure capturing in vivo bioluminescence generated by the activity of MPO as a marker for infiltration of neutrophils. In order to imagine 5 mice select field of view D and select 1.5 cm subject height (Figures 2 and 3) (Gross et al., 2009; Tseng and Kung, 2012). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160923/20160923034728_8053.jpgFigure 2.

Screen capture image of the IVIS acquisition control panelQuantify the MPO signal using the Living Image software. First select region of interest (ROI) using ROI tools and choose to automatically draw measurement ROIs and perform ROI analyses to measure photon radiance. Also measure background ROI and subtract from your ROI measurement. Use average radiance to plot your graph."
