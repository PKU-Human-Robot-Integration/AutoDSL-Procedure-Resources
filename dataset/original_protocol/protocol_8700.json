    "All animals were treated as humanely as possible. Insects were shipped as pupae from Costa Rica Entomological Supply, Costa Rica.\n1. Heliconius Pupae Care\nHang all pupae spaced 2-3 cm apart in a humidified chamber using insect pins.\nAfter eclosion, allow wings to dry then keep butterflies alive for at least 1 day in a humidified chamber and feed a dilute honey solution daily before recording.\n\t\nDilute honey with water to about a 20% honey solution by volume, and pour into a shallow Petri dish.\nBring individual butterflies to the Petri dish, one by one. Upon touching the solution with their front tarsi, the butterflies will automatically extend their proboscides and drink from the Petri dish. If their proboscis does not automatically extend, use forceps to pull the proboscis out and introduce it to the honey solution.\n2. Optical Track, Calibration, and Measurement of Experimental Light Conditions\nPlace a 150 W Xenon arc lamp with housing and universal power supply and an attached condenser lens assembly on one end of a table at least one meter long to deliver bright white light.\n\tCAUTION: Xenon arc lamps produce extremely bright light with strong UV intensities. Protective eyewear should be worn at all times and the lamp should be used as directed by the manufacturer to prevent accumulation of ozone caused by interaction of UV light with atmospheric oxygen.\nSet up an optical track one meter in length for the light exiting the housing assembly to pass through (Figure 1).",
    "Place in the following order on the optical track with approximate distances apart: 1) a convex silica or quartz lens 40 cm from the condenser assembly, 2) a neutral density filter wheel (with no filters currently in the light path) 22 cm further along the track, 3) a shutter with drive unit 14 cm from the ND filters, 4) a concave silica or quartz lens immediately adjacent following the shutter, and 5) a collimating beam probe 6 cm further along the far end of the track.\nAffix a 600 µm diameter fiber optic cable to the collimating beam probe.\n\t\tNote: Depending on light intensity, a 5-10 mm diameter fiber optic cable may be required to deliver enough light to other preps and may be substituted for this.\nAdjust the distance, height and angle of each optical element so that the light beam exiting the assembly is at the highest intensity possible.\nAs optical track elements may differ slightly with different applications, ensure that all elements transmit light in the UVA and visible range (315-700 nm).\nOnce the optical track is assembled, measure the light that passes through the setup using a spectrometer. Calibrate the spectrometer first using a calibration lamp with a known spectrum and the manufacturer's software.\n\tNote: We describe the following set up using Ocean Optics products for clarity but other manufacturers (e.g., Avantes) sell comparable products.\n\t\nTurn on the tungsten calibration lamp at least 45 min before taking measurements.\nTo calibrate, attach the spectrometer via USB to a computer with the associated software installed. Then connect the spectrometer to the tungsten calibration lamp via a UV-visible transmitting cosine corrector.\nSelect \"New Absolute Irradiance Measurement\" from the \"File\" tab, and select the spectrometer as the \"Source.\"",
    "Follow the prompts to create a new calibration \"cal\" file. When prompted, load the provided data file for the known spectrum of the tungsten calibration lamp in the visible light range (300-800 nm) into the software, which automatically calculates the corrected spectrum from the spectrometer output.\nSave the calibration file. Load this file when initializing the software for all future measurements of light spectra using the spectrometer.\nOnce the spectrometer is calibrated, use this to record the light spectra from the experimental setup. Hereafter when the software is opened, select \"New Absolute Irradiance Measurement\" and load the previously saved calibration file. Next take a dark spectrum by blocking all light to the spectrometer.\n\t\nWith the spectrometer currently measuring the desired experimental light conditions, adjust the integration time (4 msec), scans to average (5), and boxcar width (5), so the spectrum is properly scaled and smoothed. Keep the settings the same for all spectral measurements, so that light intensities from different measurements can be compared.\nMeasure spectra for unattenuated white light, for all neutral density filters to be used during experiments, and for each bandpass interference filter (Figure 2).\n\t\nMeasure the white light spectrum without any filters in the light path by affixing the free end of the fiber optic cable from step 2.2.2 to the spectrometer. With the calibration file loaded from step 2.3, save the white light spectrum using the spectrometer's software as a text file.\n\t\tNote: Spectra saved as text files list the wavelength (x coordinates) in one column and the intensity of light (y coordinates) in the second column, so that the data may be loaded into a spreadsheet for step 2.6.",
    "Using the same setup as step 2.5.1, record the spectrum from each optical density (OD) (0-3.5 OD) used during experiments by rotating the neutral density (ND) filter wheel in the optical track, and save the text file for each OD.\nUsing the same setup as step 2.5.1, place the 10 nm half bandwidth interference filters one by one into the light path and record the spectrum observed for each filter. Repeat this procedure for each of 41 different interference filters with peak transmittances spaced every 10 nm from 300 to 700 nm. Filters spaced further apart (20 nm) are acceptable for most applications (for spectra, see Figure 2).\nCorrect for differences in intensity of light when interference filters are placed in the light path. Each interference filter allows a different total number of photons to pass, and the low transmission of some filters makes it difficult to further attenuate intensity so that all filters allow equal numbers of photons.\n\t\nTo calculate the relative intensity (I) for each 10 nm bandwidth interference filter, solve for I in the expression, I = T/sec, where T is the area under the spectral curve of each 10 nm interference filter (from 2.5.3), and s is the maximum absolute irradiance (y value of saved text file from 2.5.1) of white light at the peak wavelength of each filter (See Figure 2 for an example at 520 nm).\nDivide all calculated intensities by the max intensity value calculated in 2.6.1 to normalize to one, and take the reciprocal of the relative normalized values for use as a correction factor applied to the raw sensitivity at each wavelength (see Step 6.4).",
    "Perform steps 2.1 through 2.6 only once before a set of experiments. Over the course of an experiment periodically record the absolute irradiance of the Xenon arc lamp under bright light and neutral density filters, to make sure the intensity of the light stimulus does not change.\nDuring the course of an experiment, if any cellular response to light transmitted through the interference filters approaches the maximum response amplitude, use the ND filters to attenuate the signal. If ND filters are used during an experiment, account for the corresponding decrease in intensity during the calculation of spectral sensitivity.\nSet up optical track, calibration, and filters days or weeks before experiments begin. Keep filters covered to prevent dust accumulation.\n3. Recording Equipment Setup\nFeed the same fiber optic cable used for calibration through a Faraday cage and mount on a goniometric device such as a Cardan arm perimeter (see Figure 3 for diagram). The cable will be about 10 cm away from the eye of the specimen.\nPlace a metal stage on a vibrationally isolated table with an electrode holder mounted directly above the stage under control of a micromanipulator (Figure 4). Place the Cardan arm so that the specimen's head is at the center of the sphere created by the arm's rotational movement.\nUsing an intracellular preamplifier system, which includes an amplifier (outside the Faraday cage) and preamplifier (headstage, near the prep inside the Faraday cage) mount the headstage above the metal stage where the specimen will be placed.\n\t\nConnect a coaxial cable to the headstage via a BNC connection. Split open only the tip on the other end of the coaxial cable, and separate the outer metal sheath of the cable from the inner wire.",
    "Solder the outer sheath (kept at ground potential) to one end of an insulated copper wire with an alligator clip on the other end. This alligator clip will attach to the metal reference electrode on the specimen platform (Step 5.1.4).\nSolder the inner wire of the coaxial cable to a thin silver wire, to serve as the recording electrode. This wire should be thin enough to be fed into the solution-filled glass electrode in Step 5.2.3.\nPlace a stereomicroscope attached to a swinging arm and base on the wooden bench outside the Faraday cage, so that it may be swung in to lower the electrode into the eye, and swung back out again once the electrode is in the eye.\nMake sure everything metal inside the Faraday cage is properly grounded.\nOutside the Faraday cage, attach the preamplifer to the input of a 50-60 Hz noise reducer (optional), and connect the output to one channel of an oscilloscope using a BNC T-adapter.\nUsing the other end of the T-adapter, connect the signal passing through the oscilloscope to one channel of the hardware. Attach this hardware to a computer by a USB cable, which will allow responses recorded with the preamplifier to be read by software on the computer.\nAttach the shutter driver from the optical track to the second channel of the oscilloscope using another T-adapter and connect this to a pulse generator that will control the frequency and duration of light flashes delivered to the eye (Step 5.5).\n\tNote: Setup of the rig itself should only need to be done once. Break here until ready to begin recordings.\n4. Prep on the Day of Recording",
    "Turn on the Xenon lamp at least 45 min before the experiment and turn on the glass microelectrode puller at least 30 min before pulling glass electrodes.\nTurn on all recording equipment (shutter, amplifier, noise eliminator, pulse generator, oscilloscope, and data acquisition hardware) and make sure the shutter is closed by default so no light passes through the fiber optic cable.\nPull fine borosilicate (or aluminosilicate) glass microelectrodes (100-250 MΩ resistance is ideal) using a glass microelectrode puller. Use glass electrodes within only a few hr of being pulled.\nBackfill the electrodes with 3 M Potassium chloride (KCl). Note that this solution may be modified according to the researcher's needs, e.g. dye injection.\n5. Specimen Prep and Recording Procedure\nPrepare the Specimen\n\t\nAffix an individual butterfly inside a small plastic tube with hot wax so the head is immobile and protruding from one end of the tube. Wax down proboscis, antennae, and wings (Figure 5).\nHold down the abdomen with a dry piece of wax and keep the tube humidified by placing a wet tissue inside the tube behind the abdomen. Make sure the specimen is completely immobile.\nMount the tube using a small piece of wax onto a small platform with a ball-and-socket joint that is attached to a magnetic base.\nUnder a dissecting microscope, insert a silver wire of 0.125 mm diameter into the head via the mouthparts to be used as the reference electrode. Before the experiment, permanently fix the wire to the platform in such a way that the copper wire in Step 3.3.2 may clip on to it once the platform is placed on the stage for recording.\nOnce the reference electrode is in a suitable position it may be kept in place by quickly melting and then cooling wax around the wire.",
    "Using a breakable carbon steel razor blade, grip part of the blade with a blade holder and break off a small piece to use for cutting the cornea.\nCut a small hole (~10 ommatidia in diameter) in the left cornea using the razorblade and seal the hole with Vaseline to prevent desiccation.\nOnce the cornea is cut, insert the recording electrode into the eye as quickly as possible because hemolymph in the eye will quickly harden and make it impossible to insert an electrode. If possible perform the dissection in the rig where the recording will take place.\n\tNote: Vaseline should not be smeared on the rest of the eye as this will defocus the optics.\n\t\nIf not already on the stage, place the mounted specimen and platform onto the stage in the recording rig. Connect the headstage ground wire from step 3.3.2 to the reference electrode on the specimen platform using alligator clips.\n\t\tNote: If possible use a red filter to illuminate the animal.\nUse a light source with gooseneck attachments to briefly light the specimen under a stereoscope while lowering the recording electrode into the eye.\nInsert the silver wire connected to the headstage from step 3.3.3 into the KCl solution in the back of a glass microelectrode. Mount the glass electrode on the electrode holder.\nAdjust the electrode holder so the microelectrode is directly over the hole previously cut in the cornea, about a millimeter above the cornea. Lower the microelectrode into the eye using the micromanipulator until a circuit is completed, as shown by a large change in potential (mV) on the oscilloscope.\nOnce in the eye, swing the stereoscope outside the Faraday cage, and turn off the light source illuminating the specimen. The room should be kept dark so the eye becomes dark adapted.",
    "Check the resistance of the electrode by applying a 1 nA current from the amplifier and noting the change in voltage. Resistance should typically be in the range between 100-250 MΩ. Higher resistances are indicative of blockage or bending of the electrode, and low resistances of electrode breakage.\nActivate the pulse generator so the shutter opens allowing a flash of light with a 50 msec duration every 0.5 sec, and allow it to continue flashing for the duration of the experiment.\n\t\nAdjust the pulse generator so it allows flashes of up to 50 msec duration. This duration and 0.5 sec pause between flashes keeps the specimen as near to dark adapted as possible during the experiment. Fifty msec is close to the shortest flash duration that will elicit the same amplitude in response as longer flash durations.\nRe-measure responses at both the beginning and end of the experiment (Step 5.16). Over the course of about a twenty minute experiment, these flash settings do not degrade the response over time. Different preps may require adjustments to these flash settings.\nPosition the Cardan arm so that the fiber optic cable is directed toward the eye.\nCheck the oscilloscope for voltage change with each light flash. A negative change in voltage signifies that the electrode has not yet entered a cell.\nMove the Cardan arm around the specimen until it is positioned at an angle to the eye at which there is a maximum voltage response.\nRotate the micromanipulator back and forth, causing very small vertical movements of the electrode in both directions while lightly tapping the base of the electrode holder or using the Buzz function on the preamplifier. Continue making small adjustments until a depolarizing light response appears on the oscilloscope (Figure 6).",
    "Adjust the Cardan arm again to find the angle of incidence where a flash of light produces the largest depolarizing signal. Make small adjustments with the micromanipulator and use the Buzz function on the amplifier as needed to make sure the electrode is stably recording the cell and that it will stay in the cell for the whole experiment (See Step 5.11).\nOnce the setup is stable, begin recording. A stable recording should have little to no change in resting potential, low background noise, and a consistently large depolarizing response (at least a 10:1 signal to noise ratio).\n\t\nRun the software on the computer, and begin a \"new experiment,\" which will open a pop up window with four channels.\nAdjust the voltage scale at the top right corner of the software window to 500 mV. The first channel will display the responses recorded from the electrode in real time, while the second channel will record the square wave produced by the function generator, if the signal is fed to the data acquisition hardware via the oscilloscope, showing when the shutter is open. The other two channels are unneeded.\nClick \"Start\" at the bottom right hand corner to begin recording, and allow the software to run for the duration of the experiment. Adjust the zoom of the x (time) and y (voltage) axes so that the responses are clear.\nFirst, with white light, record up to 10 individual responses with the ND filter wheel at 3.5 OD (about 5-10 sec).",
    "Next record the same number of responses at 3.3 OD, then 3.1, 3.0, 2.5, 2.3, 2.1, etc. in every combination until 0.0 OD. These response amplitudes to the ND filter series will provide the response-log intensity curve in Section 6. If bleaching occurs, use fewer flashes of bright stimuli during the course of the experiment.\nRecord the response of the cell to all wavelengths, using the interference filters.\n\t\nFirst find the peak wavelength. Without ND filters in the light path (0.0 OD), place a UV transmitting filter in the light path and briefly observe the response amplitude. Repeat with a blue transmitting filter, a green transmitting filter, and a red transmitting filter, which should give some idea of where the peak response will be.\nUse filters at about 350, 450, 550, 650 nm to find the general region of peak sensitivity in step 5.14.1. The exact wavelength does not matter in this initial search phase because all wavelengths will be recorded in the next step. If estimates exist of peak sensitivities, or they have been previously recorded, use known wavelengths to quickly identify the peak response.\nOnce the peak response or close to it is identified, record at this wavelength for 10 responses (about 5 sec).\nAfter recording at the wavelength of peak response, record with the other interference filters, from 300-700 nm at 10 nm steps. Start from the peak and step out toward both shorter and longer wavelengths by swapping the filters out from the light path one by one (e.g. if the peak response is at 520 nm, record responses at this wavelength first, then 510 nm, followed by 530 nm, 500 nm, 540 nm, 490 nm, 550 nm, and so on until no there is no response).",
    "Allow for up to 10 responses per filter (5 sec each). When swapping interference filters, allow the cell to respond to 1-2 flashes of white light without any filter in the light path, which is helpful to monitor whether the peak response is degrading over time. Reduce the number of responses or increase the OD if bleaching occurs.\nIf the response under any interference filter is too close to the maximum response under white light at 0 OD, then attenuate with ND filters. The interference filters and size of the fiber optic cable used in this experiment greatly attenuate the intensity of light and so ND filters are typically not needed.\nIf the recording remains stable, re-record wavelengths around the peak response, which serves as a pseudoreplicate for confirming previous response amplitudes and helps to ensure the response has not degraded over time. Once all wavelengths are recorded, re-record the responses under the ND series, as in step 5.12.\nOnce recording is complete click \"Stop\" on the software, and save the recording for analysis.\nAfter an experiment, sacrifice the individual by freezing, or cooling for several minutes followed by swiftly severing the head and crushing the thorax.\nShut down all equipment. Break here if needed before doing the analysis.\n6. Spectral Sensitivity Analysis\nWith the software used to record raw responses, calculate the mean response amplitude of 10 individual responses for each filter in the ND series and for each interference filter.\nCreate a response-log intensity (VlogI) function from the ND filter series recorded in Steps 5.12-5.13 (Figure 7). Do this by plotting log units of intensity (OD) on the X axis, and response to each intensity on the y axis.",
    "To derive spectral sensitivity of the cell at different wavelengths, typically fit the Naka-Rushton equation to the data from step 6.2, and use this equation to relate experimentally obtained spectral responses of different wavelengths to relative photons required to elicit that response under a constant wavelength (in this case white light).\n\t\tNote: The Naka-Rushton equation is: V/Vmax = In/(In + Kn), where I is the stimulus intensity, V is the response amplitude, Vmax is the maximum response amplitude, K is the stimulus intensity giving ½ Vmax, and n is the exponential slope. Various methods can be used to fit this equation to the VlogI data, including curve fitting software, or code-based statistical packages.\nTo fit the Naka-Rushton equation using simple calculations and a spreadsheet program, transform the VlogI response data for each stimulus intensity: log[(Vmax/V) - 1]. Then perform linear regression on the transformed data to get the equation of the line of best fit.\n\t\tNote: Vmax must be greater than any measured responses; to keep this consistent, this method estimates Vmax as 1% greater than the highest measured response.\nFrom the equation of the regression line, estimate the exponent (n) by taking the negative slope, and log(K) = y-intercept/n.\nOnce the parameters for Vmax, n, and K have been estimated, determine the relative number of photons required to elicit the spectral response of the cell at each wavelength by plugging in the measured spectral response at a given wavelength as (V) and solving for I.\nMultiply the calculated stimulus intensity (I) from step 6.3 by the correction factor for each interference filter (from step 2.4.3) at each wavelength.",
    "To get sensitivity, all intensities must be related to the V log-I curve so they can be compared. Do this by relating each wavelength intensity to ½ Vmax or K, calculated in Step 6.2.3.\n\t\nSubtract each corrected wavelength intensity (Step 6.4) from K. \nThen for each wavelength intensity, add this “distance from K” value to K, and multiply by (-1). \nNext bring all data points positive by adding the absolute value of the lowest data point in the series to each wavelength.\nFind sensitivity at each wavelength by taking the reciprocal of all newly calculated intensities from Step 6.5.1. Transform the data so that the sensitivity spectrum falls between 0 and 1.\nAfter recording from more than one cell of the same type average the final responses and plot with standard error bars or 95% confidence intervals (Figure 8). \nSubscription Required.
