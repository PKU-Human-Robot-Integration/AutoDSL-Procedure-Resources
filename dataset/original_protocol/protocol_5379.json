    "Nomarski and confocal microscopy were used to observe clarified thick samples to depict the complex vascularization and the epithem, respectively. Optical microscopy in transmitted light (on thin sections) and transmission electron microscopy (on ultrathin sections) were used to localize both bacteria within the hydathode and changes in cell or tissue structure during infection.Clarification of the samples for Nomarski and laser confocal microscopyUse the hollow punch or razor blades to take pieces of leaf margins.Immerse the samples in the chloral hydrate-based clarification solution (see Recipe 1) for several weeks (usually 1-3 weeks) at 4 °C in the dark (in a fridge).Mount samples in the same solution and observe by Nomarski microscopy. Acquire images (see Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171015/20171015222221_3313.jpgFigure 1. Typical images of cauliflower (A) and Arabidopsis (B) acquired in Nomarsky. Scale bars = 100 µm.For confocal microscopy of the same samples, rinse the samples overnight in distilled water at 4 °C.Stain the samples in an aqueous solution of 0.01% calcofluor (for cellulose) for 1 h at room temperature. Rinse in distilled water and mount in water on a glass slide.Acquire images using the 405 nm ray line of laser diode for excitation and collect the emitted fluorescence between 410 and 500 nm. The samples being thick, we use objective lens with long working distance to avoid too much pressure on the sample during observation and acquisition. Thus, we favor water immersion objective lenses (working distance of 2 to 3 mm) to perform observations in depth (see Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171015/20171015222304_6703.jpgFigure 2.

    "Maximal projection of 20 confocal planes (z-stack) within a hydathode to depict the organization of the tracheids and their ornamentation. Scale bars = 25 µm.Sample preparation for electron and optical microscopyWith a razor blade, take pieces (2-3 mm2) of leaf margins encompassing hydathodes.Fix the samples under vacuum for 10 min with fixation solution (see Recipe 2). Release the vacuum slowly and repeat (2-3 times) until the samples sink.Fix the samples for 1 h, at the atmospheric pressure, in the fixation solution without Triton X-100.Rinse the samples three times in 0.2 M sodium cacodylate buffer (15 min each time, see Recipe 3).Post-fix the samples with 2% osmium tetroxide in 0.2 M sodium cacodylate buffer for 1 h at room temperature.Rinse the samples three times in 0.2 M sodium cacodylate buffer (15 min each time).Dehydrate the samples in a graded series of aqueous solution of ethanol concentrations (25%, 50%, 1 h for each treatment).Conserve the samples in ethanol 70% (minimum 1 h) until the use of Leica microwave apparatus (AMW) to dehydrate and infiltrate the Epon resin (The infiltration is done according to the following program, see Table 1).Table 1. Procedure of resin infiltrationimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171015/20171015222510_2362.jpgNotes: *Slope: means that the temperature raised progressively to reach the indicated value at the end of the time.**Continuous: means that the temperature reached as soon as possible the indicated value and was then maintained.Place the samples in flat bottom embedding capsule filled with pure resin for 48 h of polymerization at 60 °C in an oven.For optical microscopy Cut the resin-embedded sample at a thickness of 0.5 µm with a Histo-diamond knife. The sections are placed on a drop of water on a glass slide and warmed to 50 °C on a hot plate to dry and stick on the glass.",
    "Stain the sections by covering the slide in a 1% borax solution (see Recipe 4) containing 0.1% toluidine blue and 0.2% methylene blue (these two stains were used to contrast thin sections from resin embedded samples). Rinse in water and then cover the slide with an aqueous solution of 0.07% of basic fuchsin (use to stain acidic compounds, see Recipe 5).Acquire images (see Figure 3) using an optical microscope (ZEISS, Axioplan 2 imaging) equipped with a CCD color camera (ZEISS, AxioCam MRc)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171019/20171019002157_7329.jpgFigure 3.

A. Note a pore (arrow), a large chamber below the pore (open arrow); B. The presence of bacteria in the meatuses (arrowhead). Scale bars = 25 µm.For transmission electron microscopy Cut the resin-embedded sample at a thickness of 70-80 nm and collect the sections on gold grids and keep to dry overnight before the periodic acid-thiocarbohydrazide-silver (Ag) proteinate (PATAg) treatment.Float the sections (on the grids) for 30 min at room temperature on an aqueous solution of 1% (w/v) of periodic acid (see Recipe 6).Rinse twice the sections on distilled water for 2 h (1 h for each).Treat the sections overnight at 4 °C with a 20% acetic acid solution containing 0.2% thiocarbohydrazide.Wash the sections in solutions of decreasing concentrations of acetic acid (20%, 10%, and 5% acetic acid solutions to distilled water) for 30 min each at room temperature.Float the sections in a 1% (w/v) silver proteinate (see Recipe 7) for 30 min in the dark at the room temperature.Wash the sections in water (2-3 times, 20 min each time) and air-dry.",
    "Observe the sections under a transmission electron microscope operating at 80 kV and acquire images (see Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171015/20171015223128_2031.jpgFigure 4.

The arrows indicate the secondary cell wall ornamentation of the xylem vessels. The arrowheads indicate the epithem meatuses colonized by bacteria. Note in (C) the vessel invaded by bacteria.
