    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nBone marrow cell isolation\nTiming: 3 h\nThe following steps provide the procedure of collection and differentiation of bone marrow-derived cells into BMDCs.\nNote: Ensure that all the reagents and samples are kept on ice during the entire procedure.\nPerform all steps in a laminar flow hood with sterile equipment to maintain sterility.\nFor one cell culture 6 well microplate, you will need bone marrow from one mouse.\nNote: We have found that mice aged 6–8 weeks provide ideal conditions for cultivation of BM derived CD11c+ cells. Young mice provide a good amount of good quality BM cells, while older mice provide more BM cells but the quality is not that good.\nCritical: Sterile technique is required for the isolation of BM cells; all tools should be rinsed with ethanol, and procedures should be performed in a laminar flow hood.\nEuthanize the mice with inhaled anesthetics (here, isoflurane was used: Inhalation of 5.0 relative vol. % in an anesthesia chamber at an oxygen flow of 1 L/min) or CO2, followed by cervical dislocation.\nPut the mouse abdomen down-faced on a towel sprayed with 70% ethanol. Sterilize the hind legs and back by spraying with 70% (vol/vol) ethanol. Pin the paws to a suitable surface (Styrofoam for example).\nUsing scissors, cut the midline of the back and continue cutting to expose the femurs (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1983-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Isolation of murine femurs and tibiae\n(A) Place the mouse face down to the dissecting platform. Cut the skin at the back and expose the legs.",
    "(B) Cut the femur at the hip joint (1.), then take out the whole leg. Separate the femur by cutting the knee joint (2.). Separate the tibia from the paw (3). (C) Cut off the epiphyses on both sides of the bone. Carefully insert a syringe filled with DC medium and flush out bone marrow into a 50mL falcon tube.\nUnpin the right leg and peel the skin off toward the midline.\nCut the adductor muscles toward the midline and sever the leg between the hip joint and the spine (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nOnce the leg is detached from the body, separate the femur from the tibia by cutting the knee joint.\nCut away the paw and remove excess tissue (i.e., muscle and fat) from the bone, which works best by using paper towels and gently rubbing off the tissue.\nCut the paw off distal to the ankle, and peel off the remaining skin.\nCritical: Avoid to cut the bones, carefully cut behind the epiphyses!\nRepeat step 4 for the left leg.\nSpray both legs with 70% (vol/vol) ethanol.\nCollect femurs and tibiae\nWorking on a 70% (vol/vol) ethanol–soaked towel, hold the distal end of the tibia with a forceps so that the knee joint is pointing away from you and the leg is vertical.\nUsing the tip of slightly opened scissors, strip the calf tissue by pushing it down toward the knee.\nGrip the tibia and femur with two sets of forceps and gently push against the direction of the knee joint until the tibia breaks right at the knee.\nRemove any hanging tissue and place the tibia on the towel.\nRecover the femur in the same way, snapping the knee off.",
    "To remove any remaining flesh from the bones, hold the fleshy end of each piece in a dry paper towel and pull the bone with forceps, leaving the flesh in the towel. Then squeeze the remaining fleshy part in the towel and rub it with your fingers (holding it in the towel) to clean the bone off.\nCollect the bones in a small Petri dish filled with medium on ice.\nCritical: If the bone is broken or the soft tissue is inadequately removed, the number of bone marrow cells harvested may be decreased.\nNote: DC medium can be stored at 4°C degrees for a maximum of 4 weeks. Check color of medium before usage. If the color changes from yellowish red to purple-pink (which indicates pH changes), discard the medium and make fresh one.\nDisinfect and wash the bones\nSoak the bones in 70% (vol/vol) ethanol in the first well of the prepared 6-well plate for 1 min.\nPlace them in a second well filled with 2 mL BMDC culture medium (see Materials and Equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nMove them on to a third well filled with 2 mL BMDC medium.\nCritical: Broken bones should not be soaked in ethanol.\nCollect 10 mL fresh BMDC culture medium in a 10-mL syringe and attach a 27-gauge needle.\nRemove the tibia from the Petri dish and cut it off at the ankle joint at an angle.\nCollect the bone marrow\nHold the tibia over a fresh 50-mL tube, with the narrow end of the tibia pointing down. Using the needle, gently squirt medium onto the tibia.\nInsert the needle (gently at first) at the top end of the marrow and squirt medium.\nPull back the needle and insert it again. Squirt with brief, high pressure pushes.",
    "Push the needle in further until the epiphysis has been crossed and medium comes out at the bottom end of the bone.\nContinue flushing a couple more times; when the bone is white, discard it (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nRepeat steps 12 and 13 for the femur, cutting off at the hip joint just as the tibia was cut at the ankle joint and using the same 50-mL tube as was used for collection from the tibia.\nAdd an additional 20 mL of BMDC culture medium to the 50-mL tube with a glass pipet and gently suspend the marrow in the BMDC medium with the pipet.\nPass the cell suspension through a 70-μm cell strainer into a new 50-mL tube to remove any remaining bone or muscle fragments.\nCritical: If performing this step, ensure that the bone marrow is thoroughly suspended before passing through the cell strainer, otherwise cells will be lost.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 250 × g at 22°–23°C for 5 min to pellet the cells. Discard the supernatant carefully aspirating it.\nLyse the red blood cells (RBC)\nAdd 5 mL / Falcon tube of ice-cold lysis buffer for RBC lysis and gently tap the tube with fingers to mix the lysis solution for 5 min.\nAdd 10 mL of RPMI medium to dilute the buffer after RBC lysis.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 250 × g at 22°–23°C for 5 min to pellet the cells. Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in 18 mL of culture medium and mix well. Optionally: count the cells; usually 2–6 × 107 bone marrow cells can be collected from two tibias and two femurs.",
    "Day 0: Seed bone marrow cells of one mouse in one 6 well plate, using 3 mL per well with 10–25 ng/mL of GM-CSF in a 37°C and humidified 5% CO2 incubator.\nNote: A cell yield of approximately 1 × 107 cells can be expected. In this protocol, the cells of one mouse were distributed evenly over the 6 wells and were not counted in advance. Cells can alternatively also be counted and seeded at a density of 1,5 × 106 cells per well.\nDendritic cell culture and creating an atherosclerotic environment\nTiming: 6 days\nThese steps describe how addition of acetylated LDL creates an atherosclerotic environment for the BMDCs.\nDay 2, 4, 6: Gently wash cells with pre-warmed PBS and supply them with 3 mL of new, pre-warmed DC-medium (GM-CSF freshly added 20 ng/mL).\nTo create an atherosclerotic environment, add 10 μg/mL acetylated low density lipoprotein (acLDL) or control on day 6.\nCritical: Alternatively, also oxidized LDL (oxLDL) can be used. The formation of foam cells has been traditionally studied using acLDL (Landers and Lewis, 1993[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Jones et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Macrophages that take up acLDL in vitro show phenotypic similarities to foam cells found in atherosclerotic plaques. However, native LDL, oxLDL, and acLDL are each trafficked to different endosomes and accumulate in distinct lysosomal compartments, indicating different endocytic pathways (Wang et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nDay 7: Collect the dendritic cells as described in the following steps 25–28.\nCritical: Be careful to avoid collecting the highly adherent cells (these are considered to be macrophages) by not pipetting too forcefully) The dendritic cells appear as loosely adherent ”heaps” on the highly adherent macrophage layer.\nImportant: Non-BMDCs can be eliminated by early washing steps, discarding highly adherent cells, and enriching or sorting for CD11c+ cells (Helft et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).",
    "Note: If the washings and medium changes are not performed carefully, the survival rate and number of the BMDCs will be reduced.\nCollecting the dendritic cells\nTiming: 30 min\nThis section describes, how the differentiated BMDCs can be harvested for using them in different assays and analyses.\nPre-warm the DC-medium at 37°C in the water bath (GM-CSF does not have to be added).\nRemove the medium by aspirating.\nCollect the cells\nPour 2 mL fresh medium over the cells in one well of the 6 well plate with a glass pipette.\nPipet up and pour over again, repeat this 2 times and finally transfer the medium containing the DCs into a 50 mL Falcon tube.\nRepeat this with all wells of the 6 well plate – pool the cells of one plate in one 50 mL Falcon tube.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 250 × g at 22°–23°C for 5 min to pellet the cells. Discard the supernatant.\nCritical: The optimal culture period to generate BMDC with GMCSF was reported to be 7–8 days (Inaba et al., 1992[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). We have followed this recommendation and used these cells for experiments after a maximum of 7 days in culture."
