    "Ethic approvals were obtained when performing the experiments.\n1. Isolation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs)\nEnsure that all donors signed informed consent before blood withdrawing in compliance with institutional guidelines.\nTake 30 mL of blood from healthy donors by trained medical personnel according to the standard protocol.\nIsolate PBMNCs by density gradient media. Use 10 mL of media with 25 mL of 1:1 blood diluted with phosphate buffer saline (PBS), and centrifuge at 300 x g for 30 min.\nIsolate the interphase layer between the plasma and the density gradient media by pipetting. Wash the isolated cells with 5 mL of sterile PBS and centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min. Repeat twice.\nCount the number of cells by standard methods using a counting chamber.\n2. Activation of human GPI-anchored glycoprotein by antibody crosslinking on the surface of PBMNCs\nPlace the 6 x 106 mononuclear cells (MNCs) in 15 mL tubes and perform antibody crosslinking by incubating the cells with human GPI-linked membrane protein-specific antibody (30 µg/mL) for 30 min in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 37 °C.\nReplace incubation medium with Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).\nGrow cells in 15 mL polystyrene tubes, put the tubes in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 8-10 days (without shaking). On D5, add an additional 1-2 mL of Iscove's medium supplemented with 10% FBS to each 15 mL tube.\n3. Sorting of newly generated dedifferentiated cells\nCount cells with an automated cell counter (18 µL cell suspension + 2 µL fluorescence dye) or in a counting chamber.\nCentrifuge cultured cell suspension (5-7 x 106) at 300 x g for 10 min and aspirate the resulting supernatant with a sterile Pasteur pipette.",
    "Re-suspend the cell pellet in 90 µL of pre-cooled PBS pH 7.2, 0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA.\nAdd CD45 positive nano-sized magnetic beads (80 µL) to the cell suspension and incubate on ice for 15 min.\nWash the cells by adding 2 mL of PBS buffer and centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min.\nRe-suspend the cells in 500 µL of PBS buffer.\nWash the column with 500 µL of pre-cooled PBS buffer and place it in the magnetic field.\nPlace the cell suspension on the column and wash it with 500 µL of PBS buffer (two times) and the centrifuge flow containing CD45 negative cells. Collect them in Iscove's medium supplemented with 1% BSA.\nCount the cells in the counting chamber.\n4. Preparing cell culture dishes for neuronal differentiation of newly generated stem cells\nCoat the culture vessels with poly-L-ornithine and laminin for growing neuronal cells.\nPlace the glass coverslips in 4-well plates and coat it with 1:5 diluted poly-L-ornithine (0.1 mg/mL in ddH2O) in ddH2O. Place the coverslips into a 37 °C incubator for 1 h. Then wash with ddH2O.\nSlowly thaw laminin (0.5-2.0 mg/mL) and add to the top of coverslips. Incubate it at 37 °C for 2 h.\nPrepare neural induction medium N2 consisting of 49 mL of D-MEM/F12, 500 µL of N2 supplement, 400 µL of non-essential amino acids (NEAA), basic FGF solution at 20 ng/mL final concentration (prepared from 100 µg/mL stock solution), and heparin at 2 ng/mL final concentration.\nRemove excess laminin by pipetting and add neuronal medium N2 to culture dishes.\n5. Culturing of neuronal dedifferentiated blood cells",
    "Culture BD-derived CD45 negative cells on laminin/ornithine-coated glass coverslips for 2 days in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in N2 medium to initiate a neuronal differentiation of newly BD-generated cells.\nCulture cells further in neuronal differentiation medium consisting of 48 mL of Neurobasal medium, 500 µL of L-glutamine, 1 mL of B27 Supplement, 500 µL of NEAA, 50 µL of recombinant human glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) at 5 µg/250 µL in PBS/0.1% BSA, and 50 µL of recombinant human brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) at 5 µg/200 µL in PBS/0.1% BSA and 50 µL of ascorbic acid solution 2.9 g/50 mL in PBS. Place plates in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n6. Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis of blood-derived neural cells\nCulture the cells as described above for 16 days and remove the media.\n\t\nIncubate with pre-warmed fixative consisting of 75 mL of sterile water, 4 g of paraformaldehyde. Add 10 N NaOH as needed and stir until the solution clears. Then add 10 mL of 10x PBS, 0.5 mL of MgCl2, 2 mL of 0.5 M EGTA, and 4 g of sucrose. Titrate to pH 7.4 with 6 N HCl, and bring to 100 mL of sterile water for 15 min, according to Marchenko et al.7.\nDiscard the fixative and wash the cells 3 times for 5 min each time. Immediately add a freshly made 0.3% Triton X-solution and permeabilize the cells for 5 min. Wash 3 times with PBS and add a blocking solution made by PBS and 5% BSA.\nBlock the cells at room temperature on a rocker plate for 1 hour.",
    "Prepare appropriate dilution of antibodies in 1% BSA/PBS and incubate the cells with antibody dilutions on rocker plate for 1.5 h at room temperature. Wash the cells 3 times with PBS for 5 min each, incubate the cells with DAPI and mount the coverslips with mounting media for visualization on a microscope.\n\t\tNOTE: Directly labeled antibodies used in this experiment are listed in Table of Materials.\n7. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of newly generated cells\nSeed the cells for TEM in 8-well chamber slides.\nFix the cells in 3.5% glutaraldehyde for 1 h at 37 °C, post-fix in 2% OsO4 for an additional hour at room temperature and stain in 2% uranyl acetate in the dark at 4 °C for 2 h 30 min.\nFinally, rinse the cells in distilled water, dehydrate it in ethanol and embed in epoxy resin overnight. The following day transfer the samples to a 70 °C oven for 72 h for resin hardening.\nDetach the embedded cell cultures from chamber slide and glue to araldite blocks.\nCut serial semi-thin sections (1.5 µm) with a machine, mount onto glass-slides and lightly stain with 1% toluidine blue.\nGlue selected semi-thin sections to araldite blocks and detach them from the glass slide by repeated freezing (in liquid nitrogen) and thawing.\nPrepare ultrathin sections (0.06-0.08 µm) with a machine and further contrast with lead citrate.\nObtain micrographs by using electron scanning microscope with digital camera.\nSubscription Required.
