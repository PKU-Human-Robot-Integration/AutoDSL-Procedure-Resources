    "The protocol follows the guidelines of the University Hospital Zurich Human Research Ethics Committee.\n1. Diagnoses of Neuromata and Patient Selection\nPerform preoperative nerve blocks proximal to the neuroma in order to confirm the diagnoses. Assess the blocks in the middle third of the forearm and exclude potential triggers of the overlapping innervation areas of the SBRN, such as the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve (LACN), posterior interosseous nerve (PIN), and a dorsal branch of ulnar nerve10.\nPerform surgery only in patients with considerable pain reduction (at least 5 points on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain)11.\n2. Surgical Preparation\nForbid the patient any food or liquid intake 6 h prior to the surgery.\nPlace the patient in the middle of the surgical suite on a universal operative table in a beach chair position.\nPlace the affected arm/hand on an arm rest.\nAsk the anesthetists to perform endotracheal anesthesia (fentanyl 2 µg/kg, rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg, propofol 150 - 250 mg).\nDisinfect the skin with povidone iodine in the area of liposuction (e.g. inner thigh and/or upper/lower abdomen) and the site of neuroma excision.\nCover the patient with sterile surgical drapes, leaving exposed the site of liposuction and the surgical site.\n3. Tumescent Liposuction\nMake several small stab (puncture) incisions of approximately 3 - 5 mm diameter with a #11-blade scalpel in the area of liposuction. Incise as far as the subcutaneous layer is reached.\nInject the tumescent solution containing a dilute lidocaine and epinephrine (500 mL Ringer's lactate solution, 20 mL of 1% lidocaine, and 1 mg epinephrine) via the 14-gauge infiltrator (infiltrating cannula) into the subcutaneous fat layer (3 mm in depth) in the region of fat harvesting.\nWait for at least 20 min allowing the tumescent solution to take effect.",
    "Hook the 3 mm-collecting cannula (outer diameter 3 mm, length 26 cm) to a 60-mL Toomey syringe and start harvesting adipose via the stab incisions.\n\tNOTE: The nondominant hand continually controls placement and course of the cannula.\nPull back the plunger of the Toomey syringe to the 60-mL mark and place a mosquito clamp along the withdrawn plunger in order to maintain negative pressure in the syringe and avoid a continuous vacuum creation by the dominant hand.\nHarvest a minimum of 220 mL of adipose tissue by positioning the Toomey syringes in a vertical position in the provided Toomey syringe stand; this allows the sedimentation of the fat and separation from the fluid.\nTake special care to obtain a good quality fat graft without substantial amount of blood.\n\tNOTE: Change the region of liposuction when augmented blood content is noticed.\nSuture the stab incisions with simple stitches and apply pressure as required (e.g. compressive belt).\nTransfer the lipoaspirate into a single-use sterile disposable set of the isolation system.\nKeep one Toomey syringe with lipoaspirate in the provided stand in order to obtain the fat fraction for later lipofilling.\n4. Adipose Tissue Processing\nClose the sterile consumable set.\n\tNOTE: The isolation system (see Table of Materials) confirms the completeness by performing a wet test.\nFollow the instructions on the display.\n\tNOTE: The process is mostly software controlled and only requires the manual confirmation for the listed steps below by pressing the buttons \"next\" or \"back\" on the control panel. The lipoaspirate is transferred into the tissue collection canister. In the tissue collection canister, the lipoaspirate is weighed and automatically cleaned with Ringer's lactate solution in order to remove the residual blood cells and wetting solution.\nAdd more fat if required.",
    "NOTE: Depending on the weight of harvested adipose tissue the isolation system asks the user to add more fat or it calculates the amount of additional enzyme reagent to add.\nAdd the required amount of enzyme reagent when prompted by the isolation system.\n\tNOTE: During the process of enzymatic digestion, separation of lipid and the SVF is achieved. Thereby, the tissue is in oscillating motion. After the enzymatic digestion is completed, the SVF is automatically transferred into the centrifuge chamber for cell concentration. In the centrifuge chamber, the SVF is concentrated to a cell pellet (centrifuge speed is approximately 3,000 x g) . Finally, the cell pellet undergoes a series of washes with Ringer's lactate solution to reduce residual enzyme levels in the output. When the process is completed, 5 mL of clear fluid (SVF) is obtained.\n5. Surgical Procedure\nTo approach the neuroma, make a skin incision over the previously diagnosed neuroma site in the distal third of the forearm.\nUnder the usage of surgical binocular loupes magnifier glasses (2.5 - 3.5X), continue to dissect the subcutaneous tissue and identify the involved nerve proximal to the neuroma.\n\t\nSubsequently, follow the nerve distally and identify the neuroma (based on visual inspection).\nOnce the full extension of the neuroma is clear, begin to excise the neuroma by a straight trans-neural scissor cut. If no neuroma is identified, only neurolysis of the nerve is performed.\nContinue with the neurolysis of the remaining nerve stump until 3 cm proximal to the wrist.\n\tNOTE: The end of the nerve stump should be located in the middle of the principal incision.\nArrange two to four small puncture (stab) incisions (1 mm in diameter) with a scalpel through epidermal and dermal cutis around the principal approach.",
    "Place two to four blunt cannulas (16-gauge, length 9 cm) via the stab incisions perineural to the stump.\n\tNOTE: The tip of the cannulas should be directed towards the nerve stump.\nSecure the cannulas in place by adhesive dressing.\nPlace the stitches around the cannulas and leave the suture material in situ without securing the node.\nSuture the main incision tightly in order to prevent the outflow of grafting.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that cannulas remain in situ.\n6. Application of the SVF-enriched Fat Graft\nNOTE: After approximately 1.5 h of processing, the 5 mL of the processed SVF is ready for further use.\nAspirate 5 mL of SVF in a 10-mL communicating syringe.\nIn the same manner, aspirate 2 mL of the sedimented lipid fraction in the opposing 10-mL syringe.\nMix the 5 mL of SVF with the 2 mL of the sedimented lipid fraction by alternating pulling back the plunger of one syringe and pulling down the plunger of the communicating, opposing syringe until sufficient mixing is obtained.\nDivide the SVF-enriched fat graft equally in two to four 10 mL syringes.\nDistribute the prepared SVF-enriched fat graft one after the other equally around the nerve stump by connecting the syringes to the blunt cannulas.\n\tNOTE: Before applying the graft, ensure that the cannulas are secured in the correct position and be careful not to dislocate the cannulas while applying the fat graft.\nRemove the cannulas carefully.\nThen, tape the small puncture incisions with steri-strips.",
    "Immobilize the hand by applying a splint in the intrinsic plus position (metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints flexed at 60 - 70°, the interphalangeal (IP) joints fully extended, thumb in the fist projection, wrist in dorsal flexion of 25°). If only neurolysis of the nerve is performed, no splint is needed and arm and wrist are bandaged for 10 days.\n7. Postoperative Patient Handling\nTransfer the patient to the post-anesthesia recovery unit post-surgery, and allow for sufficient monitoring in the ward.\nContinue to immobilize the wrist for 10 days after the surgery.\nPerform the first change of bandages after 48 h post-surgery and continue at regular intervals (i.e. every second day until discharge).\nRemove the sutures 12 - 14 days postoperatively.\nPerform clinical assessment of pain during follow-up at 2, 6, 12, and 36 months.\nSubscription Required.
