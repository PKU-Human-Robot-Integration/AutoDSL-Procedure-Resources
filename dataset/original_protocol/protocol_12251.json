    "NOTE: This protocol describes the fabrication of PDMS stencil with 1,000 µm patterns by laser-cutting and micropatterning of the hESC line, H9 using the PDMS stencil.\n1. Design and Fabrication of PDMS Stencil for Micropatterning\nDesign the stenciling sheet with through-holes of the desired geometry and size (e.g., 1,000 µm circles) and the stencil gasket using computer-aided design software10.\nLaser-cut the stenciling sheet and gasket on 120-150 µm and 2 mm thick polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sheets respectively using a CO2 laser-cutter10.\nBond the PDMS gasket with the PDMS stencil sheet using liquid uncured PDMS and bake at 60 °C for 3-4 hr to obtain the PDMS stencil for micropatterning.\nSterilize the PDMS stencil by autoclaving at 120 °C for 30 min and drying in an oven before use.\n2. hESCs Maintenance\nCulture the hESC lines in a feeder-free maintenance medium on 1× hESC-qualified basement membrane matrix coated cell culture plates at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nPassage the hESCs when they are approximately 70% confluent by 3 min incubation at 37 °C with dispase treatment and mechanically dissociating the hESC colonies into 100-200 µm clumps. Plate the hESCs clumps at a density of 30-50 clumps per 9.6 cm2 of growth area on basement membrane matrix-coated tissue culture polystyrene at 1:6 splitting ratio.\n3. Stencil Micropatterning of Human Embryonic Stem Cells\nPreparation prior to cell patterning\nSeal a PDMS stencil onto a 60 mm Petri dish by dispensing 700 µl 70% analytical grade ethanol in ultrapure water into the Petri dish and placing the stencil on top.\nPlace the Petri dish inside biosafety cabinet overnight to let the ethanol dry.",
    "Check no bubble exists underneath the stencil to ensure that the stencil forms a good seal with the Petri dish. This prevents leakages of ECM coating solution. Seal the Petri dish and store under sterile conditions until it is ready for cell seeding.\nPrepare aliquots of hESC-qualified basement membrane matrix according to the Certificate of Analysis. Ensure that each aliquot yields 1× hESC-qualified basement membrane matrix solution when diluted in 25 ml of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium: Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM/F12) according to manufacturer's product sheet.\nPrepare the ECM coating solution by adding one aliquot of hESC-qualified basement membrane matrix into 16.7 ml of DMEM/F12 to make 1.5× hESC-qualified basement membrane matrix solution. Keep all the ECM coating solution on ice to prevent gelation.\nSupplement hESC maintenance medium with 10 µM ROCK inhibitor (Y27632).\nECM coating on the stenciled substrate\nTreat the Petri dish with 100 W O2 plasma for 90 sec. To ensure sterility, only open the Petri dish cover inside the plasma chamber prior to plasma treatment, and quickly cover back the Petri dish after completion of treatment. This facilitates surface wetting and prevents air bubble formation in the micropattern through-holes during the addition of ECM coating solution.\nAdd 450 µl of 1.5× hESC-qualified basement membrane matrix solution to cover the whole stencil. Seal the Petri dish with self-sealable film, such as Parafilm, to prevent the solution from drying out, and incubate for 5 hr at 37 °C before use.\nSeeding hESCs onto the stenciled substrate\nExamine hESC colonies in 6-well plate to identify the differentiated cell areas showing loss of typical hESC morphology (e.g., loss of rounded, tightly packed epithelial morphology, high nucleus/cytoplasm ratio with prominent nucleoli). Remove differentiated regions using a vacuum aspirator.\nWash twice with 2 ml DMEM/F12 per well.",
    "Add 1 ml of digestive enzymes, such as Accutase, per well of 6-well plate and incubate at 37 °C for 8 min. Tap the plate gently to detach all colonies from substrate.\nRinse each well with at least 4 ml of DMEM/F12 per 1 ml of digestive enzymes and collect the cell suspension into 15 ml conical tube.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 200 × g for 3 min at room temperature.\nAspirate to remove the supernatant and add 400 µl of hESC maintenance medium supplemented with ROCK inhibitor (ROCKi) to re-suspend the cells. Pipette the cell suspension up and down 3 times gently to break clumps into single cells.\nMix the single cell suspension well and dilute 10 µl of cell samples into 190 µl of DMEM/F12 (1:20 dilution). Use a hemocytometer to determine the cell density in the stock cell suspension.\nCalculate the required cell seeding density for a given stencil.\n\t\tNOTE: For example, we have experimentally determined the cell seeding density to obtain a confluent monolayer of single cells is approximately 4,444 cells/mm2. Thus, a stencil with an area of 450 mm2 and seeding volume of 400 µl will require a cell suspension to be at a density of 2 million cells / 400 µl.\nDilute the stock cell suspension to the required seeding density (see step 3.3.8 NOTE) with hESC culture medium supplemented with ROCKi.\nAdd a designated volume of cell suspension containing the required number of cells into each stencil and leave the Petri dish undisturbed in hood for 5 min at room temperature to allow cells to settle.",
    "Transfer the Petri dish into incubator and incubate for 1 hr to allow for cell attachment. Take care to keep the Petri dish level during the transfer process so that cells remain as a monolayer in the stencil.\nStencil removal and passivation of unpatterned substrate\nExamine the Petri dish under a microscope to check if cells are properly attached onto the underlying substrate.\nAspirate away cell suspension from the stencil.\nAdd 2 ml/dish of 0.5% cell culture compatible non-ionic surfactant in DMEM/F12 to the area surrounding the stencil.\nUse a pair of autoclaved forceps to gently peel off the stencil. Swirl the non-ionic surfactant solution around as the stencil is peeled off to prevent the cells from drying out. Visually observe the micropatterned-cells in the Petri dish.\nIncubate the micropatterned-cells in 0.5% non-ionic surfactant-DMEM/F12 solution for 10 min at 37 °C.\nAspirate away the non-ionic surfactant-DMEM/F12 solution. Wash 3 times with 2 ml/dish of DMEM/F12.\nAdd 2 ml/dish of hESC maintenance medium supplemented with ROCKi and incubate at 37 °C overnight.\nAfter overnight incubation, aspirate hESC maintenance medium supplemented with ROCKi, wash once with DMEM/F12 and induce mesoendoderm differentiation by adding 2 ml/dish of differentiation medium supplemented with 100 ng/ml Activin, 25 ng/ml BMP4 and 10 ng/ml FGF2.\nEvaluate the micropatterns using phase contrast imaging and compute the average Brachyury (T) intensity profiles for each pattern as described previously8.\nSubscription Required.
