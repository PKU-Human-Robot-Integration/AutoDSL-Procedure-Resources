    "1. Immuno-DNA FISH on a 2D Coverslip\nCoverslip preparation and adherent cell seeding\n\tNOTE: Perform all the following steps under a laminar-flow hood in sterile conditions.\n\t\nImmerse the coverslip into 100% ethanol to disinfect them.\n\t\tNOTE: We use 12 mm ×12 mm silicone-supported squared coverslips (all reagents are listed in the Table of Materials).\nPlace the coverslips in a Petri dish (100 mm diameter). Dry using forced air flow for 5 min.\nWash the Petri dish with 15 mL sterile 1× Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\nWash the Petri dish with 10 mL of complete medium (see Table 1).\nSeed adherent cells (about 1,650,000 cells in 10 mL of medium, counted by FACS analysis) by gently dropping the cell suspension onto the Petri dish to obtain uniform cell plating (about 30,000 cells/cm2).\n\t\tNote: For ~ 70% confluence, adherent cells should be cultured on coverslips for at least 48 h.\nFixation and permeabilization\n\tCAUTION: Acetone is a flammable and irritating volatile substance. Use only acetone-resistant plastics or glass containers (no PVC or PVDF).\n\tNOTE: Perform these steps under a chemical fume hood.\n\t\nRemove the culture medium using a disposable aspirating pipet.\nWash the Petri dish with 1× PBS.\nUsing tweezers, wash the coverslips by dipping them into a glass beaker containing 5 mL of 1× PBS.\nDry the coverslips on blotting paper.\nFix the cells on the coverslip by immersing it into a 100% acetone solution for 10 min at room temperature (RT).\nRemove the coverslip by tweezers. Dry coverslip using a forced air flow for 5 min.\n\t\tNote: The protocol can be paused at this point. The coverslip should be stored at -20 °C.\nImmunofluorescence Day 1\n\tNOTE: This stage involves an overnight (O/N) incubation (~ 16 h).\n\t\nWash the coverslips in 1× PBS twice.",
    "Drop 100 µL of antibody dilution buffer (see Table 1 for details) onto the coverslip and incubate for 30 min at RT.\n\t\tNOTE: Solution volume should be adjusted on the basis of the coverslip surface in order to cover the entire coverslip and avoid the risk of overflow.\nPrepare the antibody mix (Table 1) using a 1:20 dilution of monoclonal primary antibody conjugated with fluorochrome and antibody dilution buffer, as specified in the datasheet provided by the manufacturer.\n\t\tNOTE: It is strongly advised to use monoclonal antibodies conjugated with thermostable fluorochrome. If a non-thermostable fluorochrome is used, the temperature utilized during the DNA-FISH steps of the protocol may damage the fluorochrome and extinguish the fluorescent emissions. In this protocol, we opted for an EpCAM-FITC antibody (1:20 dilution), which did not show any significant problems with the utilized temperature.\nRinse the coverslips twice in 1× PBS.\nPlace coverslips cell-side up in a humid chamber and drop 100 µL of the antibody mix on the coverslip.\n\t\tNote: Solution volume should be adjusted on the basis of the coverslip surface to cover the entire coverslip and lessen the risk of overflow.\nIncubate O/N (~ 16 h) in the dark at 4 °C.\nImmunofluorescence Day 2\nBlock antibody incubation by washing the coverslips in 1× PBS twice.\n\t\tNOTE: Store the coverslips immersed in 100 µL of 1× PBS at 4 °C in a chamber with constant humid environment in the dark until the FISH assay is performed.\n2D DNA-FISH Day 2\n\tCAUTION: Special attention must be paid to the high temperature of the instruments and the humid chamber.",
    "Set up the hybridization oven and dry heat oven (~ 3 h before starting the DNA-FISH protocol). Set the hybridization oven at 75 °C, set the dry heat oven at 37 °C and cool the 0.4× SSC solution (pH = 7.0 ± 0.1) (for SSC recipe see Table 1) to 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: pH status of FISH buffers is critical: pH = 7.0 ± 0.1.\nWash the coverslip three times in ice-cold 0.4× SSC solution.\nDry the coverslip under a chemical fume hood for 10 min in the dark.\nVortex for 10 s and perform a quick spin down (at maximum rate) of the probe from the wall of the probe-tube.\nPlace the coverslip cell-side down onto a drop of 5 µL of FISH probe on a slide and seal all the edges of the coverslip with rubber cement.\n\t\tCAUTION: The next two steps involve high temperatures. Wear protective gloves.\nPut the slide into a dark humid chamber in the hybridization oven for 8 min at 75 °C for complete DNA denaturation.\nMove the humid chamber into the dry heat oven at 37 °C O/N.\n2D DNA-FISH Day 3\nSet the water bath at 72 °C and place a slide-staining jar with 0.4× SSC buffer into it (Table 1). After 30 min, check the temperature of the 0.4× SSC buffer, which must be at 72 ± 1 °C.\nPrepare two glass beakers: one with 2× SSC + 0.05% Tween buffer (pH = 7.0 ± 0.1) (Table 1) and a second one with distilled water.\nRemove the humid chamber from the oven, carefully remove the rubber cement from the slide and detach the coverslip with tweezers.\nWash the coverslip by dipping in 0.4× SSC for 2 min at 72 °C.",
    "Wash the coverslip by dipping in 2× SSC + 0.05% Tween buffer for 30 s.\nRinse the coverslip in distilled water.\nDry the coverslips under a chemical fume hood for 10 min in the dark.\nMount the coverslip in liquid mounting medium with 1.5 µg/mL of 4´,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to counterstain total DNA. Place the coverslip cell-side down onto a drop of 5 µL of mounting medium on a slide, press the tweezers on the coverslip to get the air out, and seal with nail polish.\n\t\tNote: Mounting medium volume should be adjusted on the basis of the size of the coverslip surface.\n2D microscope observation and analysis\n\tNOTE: Images can be acquired with different microscope systems. We used a conventional fluorescent microscope endowed with a standard commercial software for image acquisition (Table of Materials).\n\t\nAcquire images using a 12-bit digital camera and 20×/0.50 NA and 40×/0.65 NA objective with appropriate filters for red (excitation: 599 nm, emission: 588 nm), green (excitation: 509, emission: 524), and blue (excitation: 367 nm, emission: 452 nm) probes.\nAnalyze images using software tool of choice.\n\t\tNOTE: To evaluate the immunofluorescence staining and the ALK-probe localization, we used ImageJ. Slides can be stored at -20 °C in the dark for a maximum of 3 weeks. For prolonged storage, we would suggest using specific mounting medium for long-term storage.\n2. Immuno-DNA FISH on Wire\nCell line spike-in on wire (3D support)\n\tNOTE: Preliminary set-up involves an accurate selection of adherent cells lines based on EpCAM-positivity. The wire is functionalized with anti-EpCAM antibodies so that only EpCAM-positive cells are stained.\n\tNOTE: Do not touch the functionalized part of the wire to avoid any damage.\n\tNOTE: All steps should be carried out under a laminar flow hood in sterile conditions.",
    "Resuspend the entire contents of a T75 flask (80% confluence) in a 5 mL vial using 4 mL of complete medium; for a single spike-in, about 2,000,000 cells are recommended to maximize cells adhesion to the wire.\nRemove the wire from its glass packaging.\nDip the functionalized gold part of the wire into the vial, ensuring that the wire-stopper is a watertight fit for the vial. Seal with laboratory film.\n\t\tNOTE: The use of 5 mL tube is recommended to allow for a correct match between the wire-stopper and the vial.\nIncubate for 30 min at RT in a tube rotator (0-120 angle).\nRinse the wire three times in 1× PBS solution using 3 different clean vials.\nFixation and permeabilization\n\tCAUTION: Acetone is a flammable substance that can irritate the respiratory tract. Only use acetone-resistant plastics or glass containers (no PVC or PVDF).\n\tNOTE: Perform these steps under a chemical fume hood.\n\t\nAir-dry the wire.\nFix the cells by dipping the wire in acetone 100% solution for 10 min at RT. Use a 5 mL tube.\n\t\tNOTE: The wire-stopper must not come into contact with the fixative.\nAir-dry the wire for 5 min at RT.\n\t\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here. The wire must be stored at -20 °C. When packing the wire for long-term storage, place the wire-stopper next to the functionalized tip and carefully insert the wire into the storage glass tube, taking care not to damage the functionalized tip. Close the storage glass and store (vertically or horizontally) at -20 °C.\nImmunofluorescence Day 1\n\tNOTE: This stage involves an O/N incubation (~ 16 h).\n\t\nWash twice in 1× PBS solution using 5 mL tube.\nIncubate the wire in antibody dilution buffer for 30 min at RT using 5 mL tube.",
    "Prepare 150 µL of antibody mix with a dilution of monoclonal primary antibody conjugated with fluorochrome in antibody dilution buffer, as specified in the datasheet. For example, EpCAM-FITC antibody was used with a 1:20 dilution.\nUse a p200 tip to perform incubation, as follows: extract the wire from the wire-stopper and gently insert the wire through the larger hole of the tip. Insert the unfunctionalized end first and slowly pull the wire through the smaller hole until the gold part is just beyond the larger hole.\nGently drop 150 µL of the antibody mix (for example anti EpCAM_FITC antibody 1:20 diluted) into the tip. To avoid the risk of bubble formation, gently twirl the wire until the functionalized part is completely plunged.\nSeal up the hole of the tip. Wrapping laboratory film around the hole can help.\nIncubate vertically O/N (~ 16 h) in the dark at 4 °C.\nImmunofluorescence day 2\nBlock antibody incubation by washing the wire twice in 1× PBS.\nRe-insert the wire in its wire-stopper.\n\t\tNOTE: Store in 1X PBS at 4 °C in a 5 mL vial until the FISH assay is performed.\n3D DNA-FISH Day 2\n\tCAUTION: Special attention must be paid to the high temperature of the instruments and humid chamber.\n\t\nSet up the hybridization oven and dry heat oven (~ 3 h before starting the DNA-FISH protocol). Set the hybridization oven at 75 °C, set the dry heat oven at 37 °C, and cool the 0.4× SSC solution (pH = 7.0 ± 0.1) to 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The pH status of FISH buffers is critical and must be 7.0 ± 0.1.\nWash the wire 3 times in ice-cold 0.4× SSC solution.\n\t\tNOTE: Keep the wire in the dark to avoid fluorochrome photobleaching during the following procedures.",
    "Dry for 10 min in the dark under the fume cupboard.\nVortex and spin the probe for 5 s.\nDrop 10 µL of the probe into theglass microtubes. Cover with laboratory film.\nSpin the microtubes as follows: wrap the microtube in a dry absorbent, paper put into a 50-mL tube, and spin briefly.\nCarefully place the dried wire into the microtube and insert the wire-stopper. Seal with rubber cement.\n\t\tCAUTION: The next two steps involve high temperatures. Wear protective gloves.\nPut the wire into a dark humid chamber in the hybridization oven for 8 min at 75 °C to obtain complete DNA denaturation.\nMove the humid chamber into a dry heat oven at 37 °C O/N.\n3D DNA-FISH Day 3\nPut a slide staining jar with 0.4× SSC solution into a water bath and set at 72 °C.\nCheck the 0.4× SSC solution temperature until it reaches 72 ± 1 °C.\nPrepare two glass beakers, one with 2× SSC + 0.05% Tween (pH = 7.0 ± 0.1) solution and the second one with distilled water.\nRemove the humid chamber from the dry heat oven, carefully remove the rubber cement from the wire-stopper using tweezers, and take out the wire.\n\t\tNote: Carefully pull the uncoated end of the wire through the IN-Stopper, being careful not to damage the functionalized tip.\nDip the wire into the 0.4× SSC solution for 2 min at 72 °C.\nWash the wire in 2× SSC + 0.05% Tween solution for 30 s at RT.\nWash the wire in distilled water at RT.\nDry the wire under the fume hood for 10 min in the dark.\nPrepare a DAPI stock solution of 1.43 µM in 2 mL of 1× PBS.",
    "Incubate the functionalized tip of the wire with DAPI solution in a 2 mL vial for 1 h in the dark at RT.\nRinse the wire twice in 1× PBS and air-dry.\n3D microscope observation and analysis\nPosition the wire in the wire holder. Carefully insert the functionalized tip through the entry point of the special holder, until the tip matches the coupling point. Be careful not to damage the functionalized tip (Figure 1a).\nPlace the special holder on the microscope stage. Adjust the focus of the microscope using a 20× lens. First coarsely focus on the special support and then adjust finely on cells that appear bright in the DAPI-channel.\nOnly put into focus the cells central to the lens.\n\t\tNote: Images can be acquired with different microscope systems. In this setting, we use a conventional fluorescent microscope endowed with a standard commercial software for image acquisition.\nAcquire images using a 12-bit digital camera and 20×/0.50 NA and 40×/0.65 NA objective with appropriate filters for red (excitation: 599 nm, emission: 588 nm), green (excitation: 509, emission: 524), and blue (excitation: 367 nm, emission: 452 nm) probes.\n\t\tNote: Images can be visualized using different tools and software. We use ImageJ to evaluate immunofluorescence staining and ALK-probe localization.\n\t\tNote: The protocol can be paused here. The wire must be stored at -20 °C. When packing the wire for long-term storage, place the wire-stopper next to the functionalized tip and carefully insert the wire into the storage glass tube, taking care not to damage the functionalized tip. Close the storage glass and store (vertically or horizontally) at -20 °C."
