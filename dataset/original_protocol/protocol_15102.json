    "All experiments on animals were performed in accordance with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research, and the guidelines and regulations set forth by the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary Animal Care Committee.\n1. Pretreatment\nAnesthetize an 8-week-old mouse with an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of 60 mg/kg ketamine and 6 mg/kg xylazine.  \nCut the whiskers. This is done because they interfere with visualization and instrument placement.\nDilate the pupil with 5% phenylephrine and 0.5% tropicamide. \nCut the cilia. This is also done because they interfere with visualization and instrument placement. \nApply topical anesthesia (0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution). \n2. Surgery Under the Microscope\nSet the mouse in a lateral position with the nose toward the surgeon. A toe pinch is performed to confirm surgical anesthesia, and sterile gloves are donned prior to starting surgery.\nIncise the temporal conjunctiva at the posterior limbus and separate the conjunctiva from the sclera. Avoid penetrating the sclera. After this step, grasp the conjunctiva at the limbus with forceps to control the eye. \nMake a self-sealing scleral incision using the tip of a 30 G needle with the bevel pointed up. Make a scleral tunnel through the sclera and penetrate the sclera into the choroid (Figure 1). Avoid penetrating the retina. If choroidal bleeding occurs and comes out through the scleral wound, perform an astriction with a surgical spear until the bleeding stops. This scleral wound will be self-sealed with intraocular pressure.\nPuncture the cornea with a 30 G needle to reduce intraocular pressure. Use the needle parallel to the iris to avoid injuring the iris and lens during entry into the anterior chamber. The intraocular pressure will cause the wound to self-seal.",
    "Insert a 33 G needle connected to a Hamilton 10 μl syringe into the subretinal space with the bevel pointed down (towards the inner eye), and inject 3.5 μl sodium hyaluronate gently to detach the neurosensory retina from the underlying RPE. Avoid penetrating the retina with the 33 G needle because sodium hyaluronate will go into the vitreous space but not the subretinal space if the retina is penetrated. Also, avoid rapid injection because it will create an oral tear, and sodium hyaluronate will leak into the anterior chamber.\nLet the aqueous humor ﬂow out from the corneal puncture by pushing the cornea around the corneal puncture with forceps to adjust the intraocular pressure. \nConfirm absence of leakage from the scleral wound using a surgical spear. \nTo reduce the risk of sodium hyaluronate leakage, place cyanoacrylate surgical glue on the scleral wound. \nReattach the conjunctiva to its original position using cyanoacrylate surgical glue. This will further reduce the risk of sodium hyaluronate leakage. \nCheck the fundus using a cover glass and confirm the creation of a bullous RD without subretinal hemorrhage. \n3. After Treatment\nApply  bacitracin antibiotic ointment to the eye to reduce the risk of infection.\nKeep the mice on a heating pad to prevent the anesthesia (mixture of ketamine and xylazine) from causing low body temperature subsequent to low blood pressure. \nPut the mice back to the animal cage after they awaken from anesthesia. Monitor the mice daily for complications. If any complications arise, euthanize the mice as described below. \n4. Sacrifice",
    "Euthanize the mice by cervical dislocation after intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital, and enucleate the eyes at appropriate time points for each experiment (not shown). Avoid applying pressure on the eye during enucleation because sodium hyaluronate may leak out. Bullous RDs should be persistent for at least 14 days."
