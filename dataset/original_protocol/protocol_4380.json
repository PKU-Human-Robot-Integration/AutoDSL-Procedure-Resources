    "The protocol requires 2 ml of a culture of cyanobacterial cells at the exponential phase of growth. The protocol works very well for the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 grown at 30 °C in the liquid medium BG11 (Rippka et al., 1979) with optical density at 750 nm ~ 0.4 (see Note 2). The BG11 medium is used frequently for various cyanobacterial strains, it contains a balanced mix of macro- and microelements required for photoautotrophic grow and its preparation is described in detail in Rippka et al. (1979). All further steps should be carried out under dim or green light to prevent degradation of photo labile tetrapyrroles. Alternatively, the tubes can be covered by aluminum foil. Harvest cells by centrifuging at room temperature and maximal speed (≥ 12 000 x g) for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend cells in 200 µl of ultrapure H2O. Transfer the cell solution into a 500 µl tube, spin cells down again and carefully remove all water by pipette. At this point, cells can be frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in -70 °C for up to a month.Resuspend the pellet from the end of step 3 in 25 µl of ultrapure water, then add 75 µl of methanol, mix thoroughly and incubate in dark and at room temperature for 15 min to extract tetrapyrroles. Pellet cell debris by centrifuging for 5 min at maximal speed.Transfer the supernatant (~ 90 µl) to a new 500 µl tube.Resuspend the pellet from the end of step 3 in 20 µl of ultrapure water, add 80 µl of methanol, mix thoroughly and incubate again in dark and at room temperature for 15 min. Pellet cell debris by centrifuging for 5 min at maximal speed.",
    "Pool both supernatants (~ 180 µl) in the 500 µl tube, mix thoroughly and centrifuge again for 5 min at maximal speed to remove any traces of cell debris. Transfer the supernatant to the 200 µl insert and inject it immediately into the HPLC system.Separation is performed on a reverse phase column with 35% methanol and 15% acetonitrile in 0.25 M pyridine (solvent A) and 50% methanol in acetonitrile as solvent B. Tetrapyrroles are eluted with a gradient of solvent B (35 to 50% in 5 min) followed by 50 to 64% of solvent B in 30 min at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min at 40 °C (Table 1). The program continues by column washing (36-45 min) and equilibration (36-45 min). Table 1. Setting of HPLC pumps for a single runtable:",

The column is finally equilibrated for 5 min by 35 % of the solvent B (Table 1 for the complete pump program). Eluted pigments are detected by their specific fluorescence emission maxima. Settings of fluorescence detectors, the elution times and the excitation/emission maxima of individual precursors are summarized in Table 1 and also indicated graphically in Figure 2.Table 2.
