    "There are several ways to obtain DNA for mouse genotyping: tail biopsy, ear or toe clipping, hair, blood, or fecal or oral samples. The method selected depends upon several parameters, including the established practice in your laboratory or institute and the quantity of DNA required for the assay. Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.65#cpmo65-tbl-0002] describes the different tissues typically used as samples for genotyping and the key considerations for choosing the most appropriate sampling method.\nTable 2.\n                Comparison of Tissue Sampling Methods for DNA Genotyping\ntable:\n﻿Unnamed: 0_level_0,Choice of biopsy method depending on age of animal,Choice of biopsy method depending on age of animal,Choice of biopsy method depending on age of animal,Unnamed: 4_level_0,Unnamed: 5_level_0,Unnamed: 6_level_0,Unnamed: 7_level_0\nSampling method,<2 wk,3-4 wk,>4 wk,Recommended sample size,Invasiveness of sampling,Possible repetition of sampling,Specific remarks\nTail biopsy,Yes,Yes,Yes,0.3-0.5 cm,Amputation,Yes1,\"1At 14-17 days after birth, mouse tails are incompletely ossified; at >4 wk, anesthesia is mandatory to make the procedure less painful for the animal.\"\nEar punch,No,No,Yes,0.2-cm hole,Amputation,Yes2,\"Pinna ear contains mainly cartilage. 2If ear sampling is also used as identification method, it will not be possible to do a second biopsy.\"\nToe clipping,Yes,No,No,Distal phalanx,Amputation,No,\"In young mice, the ossification process is not yet complete.\"\nFecal pellet,No3,Yes,Yes,10-50 mg4,Noninvasive,Yes,\"3Collecting feces from mice younger than weaning age (3 wk) is difficult, due to their milk diet, and results in poor DNA yield due to small sample size. 4Feces weight from a 4-wk-old mouse (∼10 mg) is much smaller than from an adult (∼35 mg)\"\nBlood sample,No,Yes,Yes,20-50 µl5,Minor,Yes6,Proper training is required to avoid inaccurate puncture and/or hemorrhages. 5≤10% of total blood volume should be taken at any one time. 6≤15% of total blood volume in a 28-day period.",

    "7. Clean the scissors or ear puncher between mice to avoid sample contamination.\nPay attention to be sure that you remove all tissue from the instruments after each animal (see Troubleshooting).\nSampling procedure\n8. Check that the tube in which the sample will be placed is clean and correctly labeled.\n9. Manually restrain the mouse between thumb and forefinger.\nGentle handling is of major importance to reduce the stress of the intervention for animals (Cinelli et al., 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.65#cpmo65-bib-0006]).\n10. Using the sanitized sharp scissors or ear puncher, precisely excise a piece of tissue, of homogeneous size relative to other samples (appropriate sizes: tail biopsy, 5 mm; ear punch, 2-mm hole; toe clipping, one distal phalanx; see Critical Parameters).\n11. Place the sampled pup in the clean cage with its parents.\n12. For each mouse, place the sample into the corresponding tube.\n13. Close the tube and check that the biopsy is at the bottom of the tube.\n14. Once all mice have been sampled, the tubes can be stored at −20°C for later genotyping.",
    "There are many alternative protocols that can be used to prepare samples for PCR. They extend from the use of a raw lysate to a variety of purification protocols (e.g., organic extraction with phenol/chloroform or silica column) designed to remove contaminants and inhibitors. Purification protocols suffer the disadvantages that they are expensive, may have low performance (Miller, Bryant, Madsen, & Ghiorse, 1999[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.65#cpmo65-bib-0016]), and are quite difficult to implement on a workstation. In contrast, direct lysis methods are quick, easy, and inexpensive, but do not remove inhibitors, and therefore cannot be used for all applications. Here, we will describe the use of DirectPCR Lysis Reagents with the addition of proteinase K for routine DNA isolation. In our hands, this approach provides a low level of PCR failure for standard PCR genotyping (Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.65#cpmo65-tbl-0003], percentage of failed genotype) and good DNA yields (Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.65#cpmo65-tbl-0003], average quantity of DNA obtained).\nTable 3.\n                Average Yields and Percentages of PCR Failure Using Direct PCR Lysis Extraction\ntable:\n﻿Sampling methoda[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.65#cpmo65-tbl3-note-0001_23],Extraction method,Average quantity of DNA obtainedb[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.65#cpmo65-tbl3-note-0002_24],Percentage of failed genotypingc[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.65#cpmo65-tbl3-note-0003_25],Easily adaptable to high throughput\nTail biopsies,Direct PCR lysis,26 ± 4 ng/μl,2.6,Yes\nEar punching,Direct PCR lysis,34 ± 5 ng/μl,2.8,Yes\nToe clipping,Direct PCR lysis,20 ± 2 ng/μl,3.3,Yes\na These three kind of tissue biopsies give enough DNA for PCR genotyping.

Visually check that the size of the tissues corresponds to the recommended size (see Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.65#cpmo65-tbl-0002] for recommended sizes).

Shake vigorously by turning over.\nThe biopsy must dissociate in the tube, indicating that the lysis worked. If the biopsy does not dissociate (indicative of inefficient lysis), remove the lysis buffer and repeat steps 4-10 (i.e., perform sample incubation with a fresh premix buffer).\nDeactivate proteinase K\n11.

    "A genotyping assay must provide a rapid and cost-effective method of identifying animals. It also needs to be reliable and robust, as it will be used to select mutant animals for experiments and for ensuring the integrity of a unique genetic resource (i.e., animals for future production, for cryopreservation, or to be received by a collaborator or resource).\nDesigning genotyping assays around markers that are found in many transgenic lines, such as the neomycin selection marker, GFP, or Cre, is discouraged as it does not verify that you are using the anticipated mutant line and is not suitable for genotyping double-transgenic strains that contain common transgenic markers. Instead, it is recommended that the PCR assay specifically identify each line and each possible allele derived from the stock mutant line. For example, the International Knockout Mouse Consortium is creating a catalog of mammalian gene function (Meehan et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.65#cpmo65-bib-0014]) and reports the generation of over 5000 new mouse mutant strains all harboring a lacZ reporter cassette and providing conditional inactivation potential. An optimized protocol allows researchers to evaluate all possible genotypes and the integrity of the targeting event (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.65#cpmo65-fig-0002]A).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/41a87148-f29e-4aef-8193-43d7ba3d84dd/cpmo65-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2",
    "Mouse genotyping strategy optimized to genotype mutant models generated by the IMPC consortium. With this strategy, the researcher need only design four different primers specific to their gene of interest in order to genotype any relevant allele combination. This design is based on the detection of a specific PCR product for each allele, and it thus avoids genotyping errors caused by false negative PCRs. PCRs 1 to 5 allow one to detect all possible combinations. PCRs 6 to 8 are additional combinations that can be used to confirm a genotype or if one PCR is not working. 5tm (CTCCTACATAGTTGGCAGTGTTTGGG), 6tm (GCACATGGCTGAATATCGACGGT), and 7tm (ACTGATGGCGAGCTCAGACCATAAC) are universal primers that can be used for any knockout-first IMPC mutant model. –, no product expected; *, this PCR product will not be observed using the described PCR genotyping conditions ; tm1a, tm1b, tm1c, and tm1d correspond to allele nomenclature as defined by the IMPC consortium; En, exon; En+1, exon +1; En-1: exon −1.\nDefining PCR design rules that can be applied to all protocols (see Troubleshooting) is recommended. This simplifies genotyping because specific conditions (reaction mix, thermocycling program, agarose gel analysis) are not required for any project, and it thus allows multiple mutant lines to be assayed in the same experiment. This strategy is especially recommended when large volumes and/or high throughput are involved.\nMaterials\nBiological material: aliquot from crude sample lysate, to be used as template for PCR typing\nPrimers for mouse-specific target of interest\nMaster mix: e.g., FastStart PCR Master (50 ml; cat. no. 4710452001, Merck)\n20× speed buffer (SB), prepared as described by Zhang, Wang, & Wang (2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.65#cpmo65-bib-0024]) using boric acid (cat no. 5935, Euromedex), sodium hydroxide (cat. no. 06203, Merck), and ethidium bromide (cat. no.

Obtain from mouse provider the sequences of the wild-type and mutant alleles.",
    "To establish an efficient PCR genotyping strategy, it is essential to have access at least to the DNA sequence of the mutant allele. Without this information, no specific design can be done. Thus, if you are unable to get the recombinant sequence from the provider, we strongly advise generating the theoretical sequence yourself using information available in the corresponding published paper. If the recombinant sequence cannot be generated from a published paper, see the additional recommendations provided in Critical Parameters.\n2. Verify that the wild-type sequence you have matches the latest release of the Mus musculus C57BL/6J reference genome assembly in NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome?term=mus%20musculus[href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome?term=mus%20musculus]) or Ensembl (https://www.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus/[href=https://www.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus/]). If it does not, you will need to carefully check the wild-type sequence provided.\nGene reannotation may change your gene structure. Other backgrounds than C57BL/6J are also available as wild-type references at https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/data/mouse-genomes-project[href=https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/data/mouse-genomes-project].\n3. Use genomic sequence analysis software (such as commercial Vector NTI, SnapGene, Geneious or free U-GENE, BioEdit, or SeaView software) to construct all the sequence maps for each of the alleles you need to genotype.\nThese software packages allow you to plan and simulate DNA manipulations, visualize open reading frames and primer binding sites, and share annotated sequence files with other researchers.\nDesign of genotyping primers\nPrimers should be designed to fit the targeted sequences. It is possible to design primers using a variety of tools (genomic sequence analysis software), or even by eye following the rules below.\n4a. Primer structure:\n         \n20-24 nucleotides in length.\nG or C at 3′ end.\nThe bases G or C at the 3′ end serve as the starting binding site for the DNA polymerase.\n40%-60% GC composition.\nComparable melting temperatures (Tm) for both primers.",
    "Comparable Tm (within 5°C of each other) will determine the stability of the hybrids once the match between primers and matrix is achieved.\nSpecific to the appropriate genomic DNA sequence.\nCheck the specificity of each primer against genomic DNA with NCBI Nucleotide blastn on the Mus musculus genome only (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi[href=https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi]). You do not need to modify any algorithm parameters or program selection (i.e., use megablast).\nThe specificity of a primer set is related to whether the primers will bind only to the sequence that we want to detect or also to additional sequences.\nCAUTION: It is not necessary that there be 100% homology between primers and a genomic sequence for nonspecific PCR amplification to occur. Primers with a few mismatches or with a nonspecific 5′ end can give rise to nonspecific amplifications.\nNo internal secondary or primer-primer annealing structures.\nInternal secondary structure can be checked by using primer design software (e.g., OligoArchitect from Sigma-Aldrich) to analyze duplex formation.\nPrimer pairs should lack significant internal secondary structure to avoid internal folding. Primer-primer annealing caused by homology within the primer pair creates primer dimers and disrupts the amplification process and is thus to be avoided.\n4b. Amplicon structure: 100-500 bp amplicon size.\nAn amplicon size of 100-500 bp is optimal for visualizing PCR fragments using 2% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis. Below 100 bp, PCR fragments are difficult to separate and visualize. Over 500 bp, PCR efficiency is lower as crude extract are usually more degraded than purified DNA. Moreover, classical Taq polymerase does not process amplicons >1 kb in size well.",
    "If the sequence of the amplicon contains >60% GC, perform the PCR setup with and without adjuvants (as described in Troubleshooting) or even with a specific GC-rich polymerase (suppliers provide an array of specific DNA polymerase designed for specialized needs such as GC-rich amplification).\nIf possible, avoid dinucleotide repeats (e.g., GCGC or ATAT) and single-base runs (e.g., AAA or CCC) in the amplified sequence, as these can cause hairpin loop structures.\n5. Select the best primer position on the wild-type or mutant(s) allele(s).\nIdeally, primer position is optimized so that the primer can be used as one primer pair for different PCR assays. With this strategy, combining common primers with different, unique primers allows all possible alleles to be detected. Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.65#cpmo65-fig-0002] provides an example of primer design optimization for genotyping mutant models generated by the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC https://www.mousephenotype.org[href=https://www.mousephenotype.org]; Meehan et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.65#cpmo65-bib-0014]). Primers are positioned in the wild-type sequence on the DNA region that differs between the wild-type allele and the mutant allele(s). With this approach, only four different primers are required to genotype any relevant allele combination for a target gene. Three additional primers are designed on the mutant sequence. These three primers can be used for any knockout-first IMPC mutant model.\nWe recommend designing two independent set of primers per allele to be detected, which will enable mouse genotyping even if one primer set does not work.\n6. Optional: Detect mutant alleles with single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutations.",
    "If your mutant allele differs from your wild-type allele by only a single or few point mutations, wild-type and SNP mutant PCR amplicon will have exactly the same size. This will be particularly the case if CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing or ENU mutagenesis has been used to generate the mutant line (Birling, Herault, et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.65#cpmo65-bib-0003]). In this case, PCR products will have to be sequenced using Sanger sequencing (Dorit, Ohara, Hwang, Kim, & Blackshaw, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.65#cpmo65-bib-0007]) or a particular SNP detection method used (e.g., TaqMan, pyrosequencing, etc).\nAs PCR product sequencing remains expensive and time consuming, especially if numerous mutants need to be screened, it may be useful when creating the CRISPR/Cas9 mouse model to insert a restriction site that does not alter the gene protein sequence (a third-nucleotide triplet synonymous substitution that does not alter the amino acid encoded). This restriction site can then be used for diagnostic digest of the PCR product (step 25).\n7. Verify that each PCR amplicon produces a size that can be readily separated on 2% agarose gel.\nSome primer pairs can be used to detect different alleles (see Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.65#cpmo65-fig-0002]B), but the size of the PCR amplicon needs to differ by a minimum of 50 bp to correctly discriminate each amplicon.\n8. Order primers from any provider.\nStandard PCR does not require high-quality primer synthesis. You can select any provider and use desalted purification.\n9. Dilute primers to 100 µM in PCR-grade H2O and store at −20°C.\nSetup of polymerase chain reaction",
    "The PCR strategy described below should be tested on three to five samples. Ideally, a biopsy from mutant animals is used for the test PCR. If no biopsy is available, embryonic stem cell clone DNA diluted in crude extract, targeting vector diluted in crude extract, or chimera biopsy can be used. A tissue biopsy from a wild-type animal should always be included as a control. Likewise, PCR reactions with no template act as a negative (or water) control to confirm the absence of PCR contamination.\n10. Centrifuge tubes containing biological samples for 2 min at 4000 × g, room temperature, to sediment debris.\n11. Prepare the PCR reactions as described below, either in a sterile 1.5-ml tube for a few samples or in a 96-well plate for larger sample numbers.\nAs the enzyme used in this protocol is a hot-start polymerase, the PCR reaction mix can be prepared at room temperature (18°C-25°C). However, if any reagents have been frozen for later use (e.g., reaction mix or primers), the tubes should be thawed slowly on ice.\nThe amount of each reagent added to the master mix is equivalent to the total number of volume reactions plus 10% rounded up to the nearest whole reaction (to accommodate pipet transfer loss).\nAdd 14 µl master mix (FastStart PCR Master, Roche) per tube or well.\nUsing a premade mixture of the enzyme, dNTPs, and reagents, such as FastStart PCR master, minimizes errors and contamination risk and reduce the time for PCR preparation.\nAdd 0.2 µl each of 100 µM forward and reverse primers (from step 9) per tube or well.\nAdd 7.6 µl sterile water per tube or well.\n12. To each 0.2-ml PCR tube or each well of a 96-well plate, add 3 µl crude extract and then 22 µl PCR reaction mix.",
    "13. Mix thoroughly by gently pumping the plunger of a micropipet up and down two or three times.\n14. Prepare a negative control: Add all reagents with the exception of the DNA template (increase the water to compensate for the missing volume).\n15. Seal the tubes or plate.\n16. Centrifuge the reaction mixture briefly so that it falls to the bottom of the tube or plate.\n17. Insert PCR tubes or plates into the thermal cycler and begin PCR program following the parameters described in Table 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.65#cpmo65-tbl-0004].\nDeveloping standard conditions applicable to all mutant models allows all samples to be processed together regardless of the project.\nTable 4.\n                Recommended Cycling Conditionsa[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.65#cpmo65-tbl6-note-0001_38]\ntable:\n﻿Temperature,Time,Number of cycles\n95°C,4 min,1.0\n94°C,30 s,\n62°C,30 s,34.0\n72°C,1 min,\n72°C,7 min,1.0\n20°C,5 min,1.0\na These cycling conditions work well with our protocols (Basic Protocols 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.65#cpmo65-prot-0003] and 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.65#cpmo65-prot-0004]) but may require modification if other conditions (e.g., other Taq polymerase) are used.\nImage acquisition and analyses\nPCR amplicons are separated using a 2% agarose gel and the results are visualized using a digital camera.\n18. Dilute 20× concentrated SB stock to 1× to be used to make and run the gel.\nThis buffer allows you to run a DNA gel at high voltages without overheating and melting your gel.\n19. Prepare a 2% (w/v) gel agarose containing 1× SB. Before polymerization, wearing gloves and safety glasses, add 15 µl 10 mg/ml ethidium bromide stock per 600 ml of agarose gel in the solution. Shake slowly without making bubbles.",
    "The greater the agarose concentration, the smaller the pores created in the gel matrix and the more difficult it is for large linear DNA molecules to move through the matrix. Changing the agarose concentration changes the size of the sieve matrix of the gel. 2% gel is well adapted for 100- to 500-bp PCR products.\n20. To prepare PCR samples for migration, add 5 µl homemade loading dye to 15 µl of PCR reaction.\n21. Carefully load samples into the wells of the gel.\nTo approximate the size of the amplicons, commercially available DNA molecular weight marker is added at each end of a row (3.5 µl per well).\n22. Run the gel at 280 V (400 mA, 100 W) until the dye line is ∼80% of the way down the gel.\nA typical run time is ∼45 min, depending on the gel size.\n23. Use a digital camera (U:Genius) to visualize the DNA fragments.\nIf a PCR product is present, the ethidium bromide will intercalate between the bases of the DNA strands, allowing bands to be visualized with a UV illuminator.\nAlways save and archive the resulting image. For example, you may need to check for genotyping errors or provide this image for publication.\nAssay validation\n24. Check that each amplicon band corresponds to the expected size for each assay. Verify absence of additional bands.\nIf yes, the PCR setting is validated, and the primer pairs should be selected for genotyping.\nThe final protocol you have designed can be used now for genotyping your animals.\nIf not, new primer sets should be tested.\nRefer to Critical Parameters for additional solutions for PCR setup.\nAdditional steps for SNP mutation detection via diagnostic digest",
    "If the wild-type and mutant PCR amplicon are of the same size (see step 6), PCR product cleavage with restriction enzyme can be performed to differentiate the two amplicons.\n25. Verify the presence of DNA amplicons after PCR by electrophoresis as detailed in steps 18-23 but using only 5 µl of the PCR reaction in step 20.\n26. Prepare the digestion reaction mix, either in sterile 1.5-ml Microtubes for few samples or in a 96-well plate.\n         \nAdd components in the following order: 2.5 µl of the 10× buffer supplied with the enzyme, 1 µl restriction enzyme, and 11.5 µl water.\nThe amount of restriction enzyme you use for a given digestion will depend on the amount of DNA you want to cut. By definition, one unit of enzyme will cut 1 µg DNA in a 50-µl reaction in 1 hr. Reactions are often performed with 0.5-1 µl enzyme.\nAdd 10 µl of PCR reaction.\n27. Incubate tubes at digestion temperature (usually 37°C) for 1 hr.\nIncubation time can range from 45 min to overnight. For diagnostic digests, 1-2 hr is often sufficient.\n28. Visualize the digested PCR products by migration on an agarose gel as described in steps 18-23.",
    "All classical genotyping methods have relatively low throughput. Automating genotyping through the use of a workstation allows parallel genotyping of a large number of genetic modifications, at many genetic loci, in many individuals. In addition to improving throughput, automation reduces the potential for contamination and error by limiting pipetting steps and preventing tube switching. The conventional endpoint PCR method is easily adapted for automation and is indeed an effective, proven, and affordable method for high-throughput screening. Moreover, PCR assays can be miniaturized in 384-well plates on a workstation, reducing the cost of animal genotyping.\nDeveloping a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) to effectively manage workstations, samples, and associated data is also essential (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.65#cpmo65-fig-0003]; Critical Parameters).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5c7a15b1-fde4-4a3a-8b5f-649203b8bc7f/cpmo65-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nLaboratory Information Management System (LIMS).

    "Design of genotyping strategy and assay validation\n1. Follow steps 1-9 of Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.65#cpmo65-prot-0003] to design a high-throughput genotyping strategy.\nWe also strongly advise following the recommendations given in Critical Parameters (section on important recommendations for designing genotyping strategy for high-throughput workflow) to guarantee successful high-throughput automation.\n2. For assay validation, follow steps 10-24 of Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.65#cpmo65-prot-0003]. Use conditions described in Table 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.65#cpmo65-tbl-0005] for 384-well plates.\nHigh-throughput genotyping strategy validation must be done in 384-well plate format as the PCR conditions of 96-well plates are not always proportionally applicable in 384 wells.\nTable 5.\n                Comparison of Reaction Volumes Between 384- and 96-Well Plates\ntable:\n﻿Reagent,Volume for 384-well plate,Volume for 96-well plate\nFastStart PCR Master (Roche),7.5 µl,14 µl\nCrude extract,1.5 µl,3 µl\n5′ primer (100 mM),0.06 µl,0.2 µl\n3′ primer (100 mM),0.06 µl,0.2 µl\nSterile H2O,Up to 15 µl,Up to 25 µl\nPrepare the automatized PCR run\nWe present here the protocol used on our two workstations (the Tecan Freedom EVO 200/8 and the Hamilton Microlab STARplus). This protocol must be adapted to each installation according to your particular workstation specifications.\n3. Turn on the workstation, the associated computer, and all integrated instruments.\n4. Open the software controlling the workstation (e.g., Freedom EVOware for Freedom EVO 200/8 Tecan or VENUS software for STARplus Hamilton).\n5. Initialize the instrument.\nThe initialization sequence is used to calibrate the robotic arm movements, i.e., to determine the reference (zero) positions along the x, y, and z axes.\n6. Flush the instrument.\nThis function uses a wash station to flush the diluters and the tubing (fill them with system liquid) and to wash the fixed-steel washable needles (or tips) on the pipetting arm.\n7. Load or generate the worklist.",
    "The worklist is a file that contains commands telling the instrument what and where to pipet. The file contains information on source and destination positions and the volumes to be pipetted.\nIf you have developed a LIMS to manage your sample (see Critical Parameters), load your worklist using the software controlling the workstation.\nIf not, generate the worklist as indicated by the workstation provider.\nLoad reagents, tubes, and plates onto the robot worktable\nA visualization of the worktable (in worktable windows) is generated by the software controlling the workstation following step 7. This windows represents the working surface (deck) of the instrument. Follow the indications on the screen to place all the reagents, tubes, and plates.\n8. Place all 96-tube racks containing crude extract on the workstation as indicated by the worktable windows.\n9. Position the primer sets as described in the worktable windows.\nWe recommend preparing the primer sets in an 8-tube strip (see Critical Parameters).\nPrepare 12-24 tube strips per mutant line and store them at −20°C.\n               \nAdd 6.5 µl each of 100 mM forward and reverse primers per microtube.\nSupplement with 187 µl sterile water per microtube.\nRepeat this step for all PCR sets used for genotyping the mutant lines (up to eight PCRs per mouse line).\nPlace all 8-tube strips needed for the PCR run on the workstation as indicated by the worktable windows.\n10. Prepare the reaction mix.\n         \nAdd 3.3 ml FastStart PCR Master and 1.7 ml sterile water in a 15-ml conical tube for each 384-well PCR plate to be generated during the run. An extra 15% of reaction mix is included to accommodate pipetting loss.\nPlace the 15-ml tube as indicated on the worktable windows.",
    "The reaction mix volume is based on the total number of samples, number of PCR amplifications to be conducted per sample, and required reagent dead volumes.\n11. Place 384-well PCR plates in the indicated locations.\nSet up a PCR run on an automated workstation\n12. Start the appropriate pipetting script (e.g., method for PCR with 384-well plates and sealing).\n13. Visually check that the pipetting process has started correctly before leaving the workstation.\nIn our configuration, the liquid handler will distribute to each well of the plate, in order:\n         \n11.5 µl of reaction mix;\n2 µl of the relevant primer set;\n1.5 µl of the relevant sample crude extract.\nThis pipetting order (reaction mix then primers and sample crude extracts) is optimized to reduce pipetting steps and duration, decontamination steps (bleaching), flushing, and risk of contaminations.\nPost-run process\n14. Each 384-well plate is automatically sealed, then centrifuged (2 min at 4000 × g) and placed in a thermocycler by the gripper arm. The liquid handler software controls the thermal cycler and starts the thermal cycling program (program parameters are described in Table 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.65#cpmo65-tbl-0004]).\n15. At the end of a run, it is possible to perform a visual inspection to check that all the wells of the plate have the same and expected volume.\nImage acquisition and analyses\n16. Follow steps 18-23 of Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.65#cpmo65-prot-0003].\nDecontamination\nWe recommend thoroughly decontaminating the instrument at the end of each week either by pipetting a 10% diluted bleach solution or by using a UV lamp."
