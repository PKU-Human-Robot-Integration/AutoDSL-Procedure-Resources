    "1. Chemicals\nPrepare a solution of 500 mM CEPA (144.49 g/mol), and a solution consisting of both 500 mM NaCl (58.44 g/mol) and 500 mM NaH2PO4·H2O (137.99 g/mol) in acidified (pH 2.5) ultra-pure water or 0.1 N HCl. Mix using a vortex until the solutions are clear.\nSerially dilute (10x) the 500 mM solutions in the same solvent to obtain 5 mM and 50 mM stocks.\nPrepare a 10 mM solution of 1-aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid (ACC; 101.1 g/mol) in ultra-pure water.\nFilter-sterilize stock solutions and store aliquots at -20 °C.\nFilter-sterilize cellulase. Store aliquots at 4 °C.\n2. Verifying Ethylene Production from 2-Chloroethylphosphonic Acid Decomposition: Triple Response Assay\nSurface-sterilize Arabidopsis thaliana Ecotype Columbia Seeds Using the Vapor-phase Method:\n\tCAUTION: The following step produces toxic chlorine gas. Conduct seed sterilization in a fume hood.\n\t\nObtain a sealable container deep enough to accommodate a 250 ml glass beaker for seed sterilization and place it in a fume hood.\nAdd A. thaliana seeds to a microcentrifuge tube and place the tube in a rack. Place the rack containing the open tube into the sealable container.\n\t\tNote: Do not fill individual tubes over half full to allow chlorine gas to penetrate the lower seeds.\nPlace a 250 ml beaker containing 100 ml of commercial bleach in the sealable container. Carefully add 3 ml of concentrated HCl to the bleach and immediately seal the container with its lid.\n\t\tCAUTION: Bleach and HCl react to produce toxic chlorine gas which acts to surface-sterilize the seeds.\nIncubate the seeds in the presence of chlorine gas for 4 hr in the fumehood.\n\t\tNote: Longer sterilization times will reduce germination efficiency.",
    "After sterilization, allow the chlorine gas to vent in the fume hood for at least 1 hr then seal the microcentrifuge tube. Leave the bleach and HCl mixture in the fumehood for at least 24 hr before discarding.\n\t\tNote: Sterilized seeds may be stored at room temperature for immediate use.\nKeep seeds at 4 °C for long-term storage. Bring seeds to room temperature before opening the microcentrifuge tube to prevent condensation. Store seeds in the dark.\nPrepare Agar Plates in 4-sector Petri Dishes (90 x 15 mm):\n\t\nPrepare 110 ml of growth medium for A. thaliana seedlings: 1x Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal medium15 (4.33 g/L) containing 1% (w/v) sucrose and 0.8% (w/v) agar. Adjust the MS medium to pH 6 with NaOH.\nPrepare 100 ml of bacterial growth medium for CEPA decomposition: Schramm and Hestrin (SH) medium16 containing 1.5% (w/v) agar. Adjust the SH medium to pH 7 with NaOH.\nSterilize media by autoclaving and temper in a 55 °C water bath.\nOnce the MS agar has tempered, add 40 ml to a sterile flask. To prepare the positive control growth medium for A. thaliana seedlings, supplement the 40 ml aliquot of MS agar with 40 µl of 10 mM ACC to obtain a final concentration of 10 µM ACC.\nAdd 5 ml of medium to the appropriate quadrants of the sectored Petri dishes (Figure 1) and allow the agar to solidify. Prepare all plates in triplicate.\n\t\tNote: CEPA is not added to the growth medium until later in the protocol.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54682/54682fig1.jpg",

Ensure seeds are evenly distributed to facilitate seedling removal and analysis.\nIncubate plates containing seeds in the dark at 4 °C for 3-4 days.\nDecompose CEPA on Bacterial Growth Medium (SH) and Perform Triple Response Assay:\n\t\nAfter stratification, expose the seeds to fluorescent light for 2 hr.\nSpread 10 µl of the 500 mM CEPA stock solution onto the quadrants of the experimental plates containing SH agar (pH 7; Figure 1) to obtain a final CEPA concentration of 1 mM.\nSeal the plates with laboratory film and cover with foil to create a dark environment for the seeds.\nGerminate seeds by incubating plates in the dark at 23 °C for 3 days with the agar side down.\n\t\tNote: Plates can be stacked, but negative controls should be placed on the bottom since ethylene is lighter than air.\nAnalyze Triple Response Assay Data:\n\t\nWith flame-sterilized forceps, remove single seedlings from a plate corresponding to each treatment and view under a dissecting or digital USB microscope. Ensure the bottom of the seedlings are aligned and photograph.\nRemove 30 seedlings from each quadrant (60 seedlings per biological replicate and 180 seedlings per treatment). Align on a surface with a black background and photograph with a ruler.",
    "Measure the hypocotyl length (mm) of replicate seedlings using ImageJ software17. Set the scale by clicking and dragging the *Straight* tool to select a length of 10 mm. Select \"Set Scale\" under the \"Analyze\" tab and set the known distance to 10. Using the *Segmented* tool, click and drag to select the length of the hypocotyl and press M to measure distance. Compare the means of biological replicates using a one-way ANOVA with a Tukey's multiple comparison test. Differences are considered significant if p < 0.05.\n3. Analysis of pH throughout Bacterial Growth\nGrow and Quantify Komagataeibacter xylinus Starter Cultures in Triplicate:\n\t\nInoculate a single colony of K. xylinus into 5 ml of SH medium (pH 5) supplemented with 0.2% (v/v) filter-sterilized cellulase.

Inoculate three of the 14 ml aliquots with biological replicates of starter culture at a concentration of 105 cells/ml. Keep tubes with cells on ice to prevent cellulose production.\n\t\tNote: The remaining 14 ml aliquot will be used for sterile control wells.\nInoculate 24-well Plates:\n\t\nTest each treatment in its own plate with three rows of biological replicates and a row of sterile controls (Figure 2).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54682/54682fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: Flow-chart illustrating the protocol used for pellicle assay and analysis. Stock CEPA-supplemented pH 7 SH medium (60 ml) is aliquoted for three separate biological replicate inoculations and a sterile control (14 ml each). These cultures are then aliquoted into six technical replicates (2 ml) into a 24 well plate and then sealed with paraffin film. After incubation for 7 days at 30 °C, pellicles are harvested and characterized by determining wet weight, thickness, dry weight, and crystallinity by FT-IR.

    "Depress one side of the pellicle to elevate the opposing pellicle edge and remove individual pellicles with forceps. While retaining grip, place them on fresh paper towel for 3 sec to remove excess medium before weighing to determine their wet weights.\nAlign pellicles adjacent to a ruler and photograph from the side using a high resolution digital camera.\nUsing ImageJ software17, measure pellicle thickness on the left shoulder, right shoulder and the center of each pellicle. Average all technical replicates for each biological replicate.\nIndividually transfer the pellicles into the wells of a 6-well plate. Treat pellicles with 12 ml of 0.1 N NaOH at 80 °C for 20 min to lyse cells.\nRemove the NaOH and neutralize pellicles by washing with ultra-pure water for 24 hr with agitation. Change water every 6 hr.\n\t\tNote: Pellicles should be white upon completion of the washing step.\nPlace pellicles on silicon mats and dry at 50 °C for 48 hr to constant weight.
