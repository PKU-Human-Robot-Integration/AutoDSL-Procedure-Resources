The purity of intermediate cell types at each stage, including mid-primitive streak (MPS), lateral plate mesoderm (LPM), splanchnic mesoderm (SM), septum transversum (ST), and EPI, can be confirmed by immunofluorescence staining of cell type-specific markers.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] The induction media for intermediate cell types at different stages should be prepared according to the tables in the “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]” section.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2654-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. A schematic showing a stepwise protocol to generate epicardial cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)\nTo generate intermediate mesodermal cell types and EPI cells, stage-specific inhibition and activation of morphogens were achieved using various combinations of cytokines and small molecules. CDM, chemically defined medium; MPS, mid-primitive streak; LPM, lateral plate mesoderm; SM, splanchnic mesoderm; ST, septum transversum; PEO, pre-epicardial organ; EPI, epicardial cell.\nNote: While all stage-specific induction media can be stored at 4°C for up to a week, it is advisable to prepare them fresh for best results. It is, therefore, recommended to make only the required amount of induction media for each batch of differentiation. Make sure to warm up induction medium to 37°C in a water bath before use.\nCritical: To ensure high differentiation efficiency, verify the quality of hiPSCs prior to differentiation through examination of cell morphology and key pluripotency markers such as OCT4, NANOG, SSEA4, and TRA-1-60 using immunofluorescence staining or flow cytometry analysis. Additionally, hiPSCs should have a normal karyotype, be free of differentiated cells, and test negative for mycoplasma.",
    "On day 0, when hiPSCs reach 85% confluency, remove Brew medium from one well of a 6-well plate.\nWash cells with 1 mL of DPBS.\nAdd 0.5 mL of 1× TrypLE™ Select Enzyme to the well and incubate for 4–5 min at 37°C.\nWhen majority of hiPSCs come off the plate, add 0.5 mL of Brew medium followed by gentle pipetting for 5 times.\nTransfer the hiPSC suspension to a 5 mL Eppendorf tube and centrifuge at 300× g for 3 min at 16°C–25°C.\nResuspend the hiPSC pellet in 1 mL of Brew medium containing 10 μM ROCK inhibitor and count cells.\nSeed hiPSCs at 2–3 densities, with one density per well, to ensure at least one well has an optimal density of cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]i) for the differentiation process to continue.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2654-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Bright-field phase contrast images showing differentiation of hiPSCs into mesodermal cell types and epicardial cells at different developmental stages\nRepresentative phase contrast images showing the chronological morphology change from day 0 (hiPSCs) to day 12 (epicardial cells) under the current differentiation protocol. Images on days 0, 9, and 12 were captured within 12–18 h of cell dissociation and in the presence of 10 μM of ROCK inhibitor. Scale bars, 500 μm.\nNote: As the MPS induction medium can lead to significant cell death, we normally prepare 2 wells by adding 1.5 mL of the complete Bew medium containing 10 μM ROCK inhibitor to each well of a Matrigel-coated 6-well plate, and then seed 2×104 cells/cm2 in one well and 2.5×104 cells/cm2 in the other well as single cells.",
    "Note: While either 2×104 cells/cm2 or 2.5×104 cells/cm2 worked well for most hiPSC lines, some hiPSC lines may require a lower seeding density (e.g., 1.5×104 cells/cm2) to avoid over-confluency by day 2, while others may need a higher density (e.g., 3×104 cells/cm2) if 2.5×104 cells/cm2 do not result in sufficient viable MPS cells. For a new hiPSC line that has never been tested, the users may seed hiPSCs in 3 densities (e.g., 1.5×104 cells/cm2, 2×104 cells/cm2, and 2.5 × 104[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] cells/cm2) to start.\nNote: The users should also take the proliferation rate of hiPSCs into consideration when determine the optimal seeding density. It is recommended to aim for less than 30% confluency of LPM cells by the end of day 2 to avoid 100% confluency of ST cells on day 5. It is also important to note that since EPI cells need to be seeded at a very low density on day 8 due to their high proliferation rate, choosing one well of ∼30% confluent cells starting on day 3 for continued differentiation will be sufficient. It will significantly reduce the reagent cost of EPI differentiation. troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nNote: While we have optimized the seeding densities of hiPSCs for EPI cell differentiation in a 6-well format, users may choose to adapt this protocol to a 12-well format to further reduce differentiation reagent costs. However, the optimal seeding densities should be tested empirically.\nCritical: To ensure successful differentiation, the viability of hiPSCs should be greater than 90% before cell seeding. It is also important to distribute hiPSCs within the well evenly by gently moving the plate in a left-to-right and back-to-forth motion. Then allow the cells to rest in the hood for 10 min before returning to the incubator.",
    "Critical: Make sure to perform the following differentiation procedures at the same time each day to ensure that the cells are exposed to stage-specific induction medium for 22–26 h on each day.\nOn day 1, wash hiPSCs with DPBS and add 1.5 mL of prewarmed MPS induction medium per well (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]ii). troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nOn day 2, wash MPS cells with DPBS and add 1.5 mL of prewarmed LPM induction medium per well (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]iii). troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nOn day 3, evaluate the cell confluency of all wells, and choose the well that has roughly 30% confluent LPM cells to continue the differentiation process. Wash LPM cells with DPBS and add 1.5 mL of pre-warmed SM induction medium to the well.\nOn day 4, refresh 1.5 mL of pre-warmed SM induction medium (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]iv).\nOn day 5, wash SM cells with DPBS and add 2 mL of pre-warmed ST induction medium.\nOn days 6 and 7, refresh 2 mL of pre-warmed ST induction medium per day.\nNote: ST cells normally become sub-confluent (∼85%) on day 5. However, for some hiPSC lines, ST cells may reach only 50%–70% confluency on day 8, which does not compromise the differentiation efficiency.\nOn day 8, wash ST cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]v) with DPBS and incubate with 1 mL of 10× TrypLE™ Select Enzyme for 5–7 min at 37°C.\nWhen majority of ST cells come off the plate, add 1mL of LaSR basal medium followed by gentle pipetting for 10 times.\nTransfer the ST cell suspension to a 5 mL Eppendorf tube and centrifuge at 300× g for 5 min at 16°C–25°C.\nResuspend the ST cell pellet in 1 mL of LaSR basal medium containing 10 μM ROCK inhibitor and 10 μM of SB431542.",
    "Count ST cells and seed at 2.5 × 103 cells/cm2 as single cells in Matrigel-coated T75 flasks.\nAdd 10 mL of LaSR basal medium containing 10 μM ROCK inhibitor to each flask.\nEvenly distribute ST cells by gently moving the flasks in a left-to-right and back-to-forth motion.\nRe-pellet the remaining ST cells and cryopreserve with Bambanker freezing medium as back up.\nCritical: Because EPI cells are susceptible to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT),3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] particularly when forming clusters, it is essential to dissociate ST cells into single cells and seed them at a low density before initiating PEO and EPI differentiation.\nNote: ST cells can be cryopreserved and subsequently used as a starting point for continuing EPI differentiation upon thawing. As ST cells can produce a large amount of tight junction proteins, it is more efficient to obtain single cells using 10× TrypLE™ Select Enzyme rather than 1× TrypLE™ Select Enzyme.\nPause point: hiPSC-derived ST cells can be cryopreserved indefinitely in liquid nitrogen tank before being further differentiated into PEO and EPI cells.\nNote: We recommend using LaSR basal medium containing ROCK inhibitor to replate ST cells, as we have observed significant cell death in some hiPSC lines when using the EPO specification medium for ST cell replating.\nOn day 9, wash ST cells with DPBS and add 12 mL of PEO specification medium per flask. Leave the cells undisturbed for 2 days (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]vi). troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nOn day 11, wash PEO cells with DPBS and add 12 mL of EPI maintenance medium per flask. Change the medium every other day until EPI cells reach approximately 90% confluency (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]vii). troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11].\nNote: Due to their fast proliferation rate and the epithelial cell-like morphology, EPI cells typically reach sub-confluency on days 10–12.",
    "Critical: It is important to avoid overgrowing EPI cells, as they can easily undergo EMT when they reach full confluency.\nOnce EPI cells become sub-confluent, wash flasks with DPBS.\nAdd 4 mL of 10× TrypLE™ Select Enzyme per flask and incubate for 7–10 min until all cells come off the flasks.\nAdd 4 mL of LaSR basal medium to each flask and collect EPI cell suspension to a 15 mL Falcon tube for centrifugation at 300× g for 5 min at 16°C–25°C.\nDecant the supernatant by careful aspiration and resuspend the cell pellet using 10 mL of LaSR maintenance medium containing 10 μM of ROCK inhibitor per flask.\nSeed EPI cells at 5×103 cells/cm2. EPI cells at this stage are labeled as passage 1 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]viii).\nCritical: It is crucial to dissociate EPI cells using 10× TrypLE™ Select Enzyme for a sufficient amount of time to obtain single cells. Otherwise, the EPI cells may be difficult to spin down and may appear as a fluffy clump floating in the Falcon tube.\nOn the following day, aspirate the spent medium.\nAdd 12 mL of fresh EPI maintenance medium per flask.\nRefresh the medium every other day until EPI cells reach approximately 90% confluency.\nRepeat step 11 for further cell passaging or cell cryopreservation. Otherwise, proceed with cardiac pericyte differentiation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2654-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "Immunostaining of epicardial markers WT1, TCF21, TBX18 and epithelial maker ZO1 was performed on high quality (A) and low quality (B) epicardial cells harvested on day 13 of differentiation. DAPI staining was included in merged images. Note that a large portion of epicardial cells in (B) are undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Scale bars, 100 μm.\nNote: a detailed protocol on hiPSC cryopreservation and thawing https://www.stemcell.com/cryopreservation-and-thawing-of-es-ips-cells.html[href=https://www.stemcell.com/cryopreservation-and-thawing-of-es-ips-cells.html] is also applicable to EPI cells.\nPause point: hiPSC-derived EPI cells can be cryopreserved indefinitely in liquid nitrogen tank.\nNote: In our experience, EPI cells can be expanded for up to 25 passages without losing their cell type markers or epithelial cell-like morphology. Since serial passaging improves the maturity of EPI cells, it is recommended to initiate cardiac pericyte differentiation using EPI cells that have undergone at least three passages. It is crucial to prevent overgrowth of EPI cells during cell maintenance, as they may undergo EMT (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) and compromise the purity of the resulting cardiac pericytes.\nNote: Before initiating cardiac pericyte differentiation, it is recommended to perform immunofluorescence staining of EPI markers. To do this, seed 6×103 EPI cells/cm2 in 12-well plates and grow them to sub-confluency in EPI maintenance medium. Fix the EPI cells using 4% paraformaldehyde and proceed with immunostaining (dilutions for primary and secondary antibodies shown in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) for ZO1, WT1, TBX18, and TCF21 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nCritical: PFA is hazardous. Perform the above staining step in a fume hood and properly dispose of waste.\nDifferentiation of epicardial cells into cardiac pericytes\nTiming: 12 days\nSteps 13–17 describe the process of differentiating EPI cells into nascent cardiac pericytes.\nDay 0: Seed EPI cells for cardiac pericyte differentiation",
    "Dissociate EPI cells into single cells using 10× TrypLE™ Select Enzyme and seed at the density of 2×104 cells/cm2 in one Matrigel-coated 6-well plate using 2 mL of EPI maintenance medium containing 10 μM of ROCK inhibitor (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2654-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. A schematic showing the generation of cardiac pericyte from epicardial cells\nSeeded epicardial cells need to form a monolayer before cardiac pericyte induction medium is added. Pericyte medium is refreshed every other day. One 6-well plate of early cardiac pericytes is recommended to be replated in two T75 flasks at day 7. Fully differentiated cardiac pericytes are recommended to be replated in the regular ScienCell Pericyte Medium at the density of 1×104 cells/cm2. Typically, hiPSC-derived cardiac pericytes show a senescent phenotype by days 45–50 of differentiation and should not be used for biochemical assays. PDGF-BB, platelet-derived growth factor-BB; EGF, epidermal growth factor.\nNote: EPI cells seeded at this density typically form a complete layer the following day. If not, grow the EPI cells in EPI maintenance medium until they reach 100% confluency.\nDays 1–6: Refresh cardiac pericyte induction medium every other day\nOn day 1, wash EPI cells with DPBS and add 2 mL of cardiac pericyte induction medium per well. Leave cell undisturbed for 2 days (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nOn days 3 and 5, refresh 2 mL of cardiac pericyte induction medium per well (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nNote: In our experience, it is crucial to keep early cardiac pericytes at a very high confluency, as it can facilitate a complete EMT and cardiac pericyte differentiation via a paracrine effect.\nDay 7: Replate early cardiac pericytes to gelatin-coated flasks\nOn day 7, wash cells with DPBS and add 1 mL of 10× TrypLE™ Select Enzyme to each well and incubate for 5 min at 37°C.",
    "Add 0.5 mL of pericyte medium to each well and pipette up and down for 4–5 times.\nSpin cells down at 300 ×g for 5 min at 16°C–25°C and resuspend them in 1 mL of cardiac pericyte induction medium.\nSplit cells into 2 gelatin-coated T75 flasks using 12 mL of cardiac pericyte induction medium per flask (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13].\nDays 8–12: Refresh cardiac pericyte induction medium every other day\nOn days 9 and 11, refresh 12 mL of cardiac pericyte induction medium per flask (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2654-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Bright-field phase contrast images showing the morphology changes of cardiac pericytes at differentiation and maintenance stages\nAt day 6 of differentiation, cardiac pericytes display a uniform morphology (i), but become more heterogeneous after replating (ii). During cardiac pericyte maintenance, a predominant stellate-shaped morphology is achieved, as shown on day 21 of differentiation (iii). When day 21 cardiac pericytes were cultured in a low serum medium for 2 days, they adopted an elongated, well-aligned, spindle-shaped morphology (iv). Scale bars, 200 μm.\nNote: During the initial 6 days of differentiation, early cardiac pericytes display a uniform morphology (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]i). However, upon replating, cells exhibit a heterogeneous morphology (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]ii). Nevertheless, after an additional week of maintenance in ScienCell pericyte medium, the cells can regain a relatively uniform morphology (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]iii). When maintained in a low serum pericyte medium (with serum concentration reduced from 2% to 0.1%) after becoming sub-confluent, the cells can form a more uniform and aligned morphology (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]iv). Flow cytometry and quantitative real-time PCR data from our previous study suggest that by day 12 of differentiation, epicardial cell-derived cardiac pericytes already express a broad range of cell type-selective markers, including PDGFRβ, NG2, CD13, and CD146.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] This indicates that the cardiac pericytes are developing and maturing as expected.",
    "Pause point: hiPSC-derived nascent cardiac pericytes can be cryopreserved indefinitely in liquid nitrogen tank for future expansion.\nCardiac pericyte expansion and maturation\nTiming: Variable durations (up to 32 days) depending on experimental plans\nSteps 18–20 describe the process of prompting nascent cardiac pericytes to become mature while expanding the cell population for downstream functional assays.\nDays 13–45: Refresh ScienCell pericyte medium every other day; replate or cryopreserve sub-confluent cardiac pericytes\nFrom day 13 onwards, refresh 12 mL of ScienCell pericyte medium per flask every other day until cardiac pericytes become fully confluent.\nTo dissociate the cardiac pericytes, treat the cells with 1× TrypLE™ Select Enzyme for 3 min at 37°C.\nReplate the cells in gelatin-coated 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 104 cells/cm2 using ScienCell pericyte medium.\nRefresh the medium every other day.\nWhen the cells reach 95% confluency, dissociate them again using the same procedure (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). troubleshooting 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.15].\nCryopreserve hiPSC-derived cardiac pericytes for future use.\nWe recommend collecting cells at day 18–21 of differentiation and suspend them in Bambanker freezing medium at a density of 1 × 106 cells per vial.\nPut cryovials in a Corning CoolCell™ LX Cell freezing container and store at −80°C overnight before transferring them into liquid nitrogen.\nThe remaining cardiac pericytes can be further expanded or used for molecular and cellular assays as needed.\nRefer to step 12 to get details on how to properly thaw hiPSC-derived cardiac pericytes for future use.\nFor a quality control purpose, check the expression levels of cardiac pericyte markers (e.g., PDGFRβ, NG2, CD13, and CD146), smooth muscle cell markers (e.g., smooth muscle-myosin heavy chain and calponin), and cardiac fibroblast markers (e.g., anti-fibroblast antibody, clone TE-7) using either flow cytometry1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] or immunofluorescence staining (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2654-Fig7.jpg",
