    "This protocol describes how to generate spheroids from three different colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cell lines. The protocol can be applied to any cell line independent of its histologic origin. The number of tumor cells different from those described here should be determined experimentally by serial dilution.\nIf it has not been determined whether a CRC tumor cell line can generate spheroids (Di Mascolo et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.366#cpz1366-bib-0006]; Sargenti et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.366#cpz1366-bib-0016]; Varesano et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.366#cpz1366-bib-0020]), it is necessary to test experimentally whether this cell line can lead to spheroids. The procedure described here can be applied to any kind of tumor cell line from any tissue origin. Usually, epithelial cell lines that grow as adherent cells are able to give rise to cell aggregates if cultured in ultralow-adherent plates. However, it is not possible to know whether a given cell line can generate spheroids. In my laboratory's experience, CRC cell lines such as DLD-1 and SW-620 can form spheroids, whereas LS180 and SW-48 do not form spheroids, although all these cell lines adhere to plastic in conventional cultures (Varesano et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.366#cpz1366-bib-0020]).\nTo generate spheroids, CRC cell lines (DLD-1, SW-480, and HCT-116) should be detached from the conventional plastic culture flask, petri dish, or multiwell plate if they are growing as adherent cells; otherwise the user can start directly from step 10.\nMaterials\nCRC cell line:\n               \nDLD-1, human, epithelial, adenocarcinoma colorectal Dukes’ type C (e.g., ATCC #CCL-221)\nSW-480, human, epithelial, adenocarcinoma, colorectal Dukes’ type B (e.g., ATCC #CCL-228)\nHCT-116, human, epithelial, adenocarcinoma colorectal (e.g., ATCC #CCL-247)\nRPMI-1640 medium (e.g., Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 21875091)\nFetal bovine serum (FBS), heat inactivated at 56°C for 30 min (e.g., Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no.

If DLD-1, SW-48, or HCT-116 CRC cell lines are not in culture, remove frozen vial of each CRC cell line from –80°C (or liquid nitrogen), and thaw in a 37°C water bath with gentle shaking.\n2. Add vial content to a 50-ml tube, and add 20 ml complete RPMI-1640 medium (i.e., RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% [v/v] FBS, 1% [w/v] L-glutamine, and 1× penicillin-streptomycin). Centrifuge 5 min at 700 × g, room temperature. Discard supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in 20 ml RPMI-1640 medium. Centrifuge again 5 min at 700 × g, room temperature.\n3. Discard supernatant and resuspend pellet with 5 to 7 ml complete RPMI-1640 medium. Transfer cell suspension to a 25-cm2 culture flask (2‒4 × 105 cells/ml), and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2.\n4. After 1 day, view cells under microscope and determine whether cells are attached to the plastic. Discard culture medium, and add 5 ml fresh complete RPMI-1640 medium. Continue to culture cells until they have covered 70% of the flask.",
    "DLD-1, SW-480, and HCT-116 grow very fast, and in <5 days the cell cultures are ready to be used for generating spheroids. If cells are not growing well, replace the culture medium every 2 days, and after 5 to 7 days detach them from the plastic before culturing again. This procedure can allow the CRC cells to grow better afterward.\n5. Remove cells from incubator, and discard culture supernatant. Resuspend cells in DPBS without Ca2+ or Mg2+. Gently move flask to cover and wash the whole flask. Harvest DPBS.\nThis step is necessary to reduce the FBS contained in the culture flask and thus to avoid consumption of trypsin by FBS proteins.\n6. Add sufficient trypsin to culture flask to cover the surface where cells are adherent (3 ml for 25-cm2 flask, 5 ml for 75-cm2 flask), and incubate flask at 37°C for 5 to 10 min.\n7. Cover flask and gently tap to detach cells from the plastic. Examine under a microscope to determine if cells are detached.\n8. Harvest cells from flask, and place in a tube with RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% (v/v) FBS (1:4 trypsin:RPMI ratio). Centrifuge 5 to 10 min at 700 × g, room temperature.\n9. Discard supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% (v/v) FBS. Repeat centrifugation.\nGenerate tumor spheroid\n10. Wash cells by centrifuging 10 min at 700 × g, room temperature, in RPMI-1640 medium (without FBS). Discard supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in fresh RPMI-1640 medium by gently shaking the bottom of the tube.\n11. Wash cells again by centrifuging 10 min at 700 × g, room temperature, in RPMI-1640 medium. Discard supernatant and gently resuspend cell pellet in fresh DMEM-F12.",
    "12. Count cells with a disposable cell counting chamber: Count 16 small squares from three nonadjacent large squares composed of the 16 small squares and calculate mean. Multiply mean by 104 (e.g., for 100 cells, cell concentration is 100 × 104 = 106). Adjust cells to desired concentration using DMEM-F12.\nFor additional details on cell counting, see manufacturer instructions, available at: https://www.biosigma.com/Catalogue/fast_read_2017_2.pdf[href=https://www.biosigma.com/Catalogue/fast_read_2017_2.pdf].\nFor DLD-1, SW-480, and HCT-116 cell lines, an appropriate concentration is 105 cells/ml. As it is difficult to determine a priori the right concentration at which the cells should be diluted, in preliminary experiments prepare tubes at concentrations of 4 × 105, 2 × 105, 1 × 1050, and 0.5 × 105 cells/ml.\n13. Pour cell suspension into a plastic petri dish. Using a multichannel pipette, place 100 µl cell suspension in each well of a 96-well plate for obtaining spheroids. Use care to resuspend cells each time to ensure homogenous cell seeding.\nThe plates used for obtaining spheroids can be purchased from different suppliers. To generate spheroids of CRC tumor cells, flat-bottom, ultralow-adherent 96-well plates from Corning can be used. Under the experimental conditions described in the text, spheroids can be obtained after 5 to 7 days of culture. Other types of plates can be used, such as plates from Perkin-Elmer, either with flat or round wells. Spheroids can be also obtained using InSphero hanging-drop plates or Kugelmeiers Sphericalplate 5D (https://www.kugelmeiers.com/product/[href=https://www.kugelmeiers.com/product/]). With these latter plates, the spheroids obtained are of the same diameter, and thus they can be used to standardize the size of a spheroid from a given tumor cell line.\n14. To each well, add 100 µl DMEM-F12 supplemented with EGF.",
    "The amount of EGF to be added can be defined in a preliminary experiment using 100, 50, 35, 12.5, and 6.25 ng/ml. Remember that the concentration of EGF in the solution added should be twice the amount put in each well. For example, to culture spheroids with 100 ng/ml EGF, add 100 µl of 200 ng/ml for each well. In the presence of EGF, we can see whether tumor cells can proliferate during their incubation time in ultralow-adherent plates.\nThe total volume in each well of the 96-well plate is 200 µl. For each experimental condition prepare at least six different wells.\nEach experiment should include a basal control and a positive control. The basal control is represented by spheroids cultured in DMEM-F12 without EGF. This condition determines the degree of proliferation, if any, by cells themselves. The positive control is represented by the culture with EGF. The experimental test is represented by spheroids cultured under given experimental conditions (e.g., the addition of a drug used to demonstrate its effects on cell spheroids).\n15. Incubate cell cultures in a 37°C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator.\n16. Check cell cultures daily on a microscope.\nDaily microscopic observation is required to determine the formation of spheroids and their viability. This observation can be made with 4×, 10×, and 20× objectives on an inverted microscope. Pay attention to the surface of spheroids by finely tuning the focus to see whether: (1) the surface of the spheroid is smooth or rough, (2) free cells are living or not, and (3) the limits among cells are identifiable or not. All these features can be relevant for detailed characterization of the spheroid and to further understand the mechanism of action of a given drug or antitumor cells if cocultures with immune cells will be performed.",
    "17. At days 3, 5, and 7, analyze spheroid size and ATP content (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.366#cpz1366-prot-0002]) of at least four replicate wells.\nEvaluation of size of a given spheroid can be determined by microscopic observation generating an image of the entire culture well or a limited portion of the well with a digital camera associated with the microscope. To analyze all the wells over time, the laboratory should be equipped with a digital camera, microscope, and if possible a plate scanner. Imaging can be performed by taking the plate from the incubator and performing the analysis with an inverted microscope or using a plate scanner inside the incubator. While the microscope and the camera are usually available in a research laboratory, the presence of a scanner for plates is not common. Scanners for plates with a motorized microscope stage are needed to perform complex experiments to obtain images at different time points from selected culture wells. Commercial examples of this type of motorized scanner are JuLITM Stage (NanoEntek), Incucyte (Sartorius), and xCELLigence RTCA eSight (Agilent).\nOn day 5 or 7, spheroids can be used for coculture experiments with lymphocytes.",
    "Measurement of the ATP content of spheroids is a fast and reliable method to evaluate their viability. This assay can be performed at different time points starting at the onset of spheroid generation.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.366#cpz1366-prot-0001])\nTumor cell spheroids (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.366#cpz1366-prot-0001])\nTriton X-100 (e.g., Sigma-Aldrich)\nCellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (e.g., Promega, cat. no. G7570)\n96-well OptiPlate, low-binding surface (e.g., Perkin Elmer, cat. nos. 6045580 or 6055260)\nLuminometer (e.g., VICTOR Multilabel Plate Reader)\n1. Harvest spheroids from the original plate by gently pipetting 50 to 100 µl medium from each well, and transfer to Optiplate.\n2. To each well, add 100 µl DPBS without Ca2+ or Mg2+ containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and CellTiter Glow reagent (concentration as indicated by the manufacturer).\n3. Mix by pipetting each well; avoid making bubbles.\n4. Measure luminescence immediately with a luminometer.\nFor evaluation of the metabolic activity of spheroids, the use of a kit for ATP content is simple and informative of the metabolic state of cell cultures. The main point to take into consideration is consistency in harvesting the same number of cells from each cell culture well and the complete lysis of cells of the spheroids (see Troubleshooting). To harvest the same number of spheroids from each well, one should use a multichannel pipette with the tips cut to avoid destroying spheroids during harvesting. Remaining spheroids in the wells will therefore not be destroyed or disaggregated and can then be used for other experiments. The amount of cell culture harvested should range from 10 to 100 µl (usually 50 µl). This volume depends on the number of cells initially plated and the cell growth rate. This amount should be defined in preliminary experiments.",
    "Lysis of spheroids to determine ATP by luminescence can be obtained using a detergent like NP-40 or Triton X-100. Usually, the final concentration of this detergent is 1% to 0.1% in DPBS without Ca2+ or Mg2+ or other buffer defined by the manufacturer's instructions for determination of ATP. The absence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the lysis buffer can help reduce cell-to-cell interactions and binding.\nThe number of experimental replicates can range from a minimum of three up to six. The differences among ATP content in the wells analyzed should be <10%. Of course, adequate statistical tests can be applied to determine accuracy and precision. It is relevant to evaluate the results to ensure sufficient data from a biological system to define the dispersion of data. Also, biological effects should be significant.\nTo test ATP at different days of incubation, use different wells of the culture. The experiment should take into account how many measurements will be performed. The spheroids remaining in harvested culture wells can be used for additional experiments (e.g., confocal microscopy, immunohistochemistry) or pilot experiments using drugs. Each experiment should be performed at least three times, and no data should be deleted from the statistical analysis.",
    "It is important to remember that in 96-well flat- and round-bottom plates, the wells of the first and last row (usually marked with A and H) and the wells of the first and last column (usually marked with 1 and 12) can contain a reduced amount of medium than the other wells because of evaporation in the humidified atmosphere of the incubator, which is more evident at the periphery of a 96-well plate. This can influence the results obtained from these wells. If counts from these wells show a >20% increase or decrease from the mean of the other identical experimental conditions, discard them. Alternatively, do not use these wells as experimental points, but instead fill them with RPMI-1640 medium, using only the inner rows and columns of wells for the experiment. Further, the bioluminescence assays used for ATP determination can give different results in terms of counts in arbitrary units depending on the color of the plate (white or black) and the presence of a given well next to other wells with a very strong amount of bioluminescence.",
    "The characterization of antigen expression is essential to define whether the tumor spheroids display similar or different phenotypes to the counterpart of the same cell line cultured in conventional plasticware. This protocol describes the staining procedure for spheroids that are disaggregated to obtain a single-cell suspension. Then, cells are processed as samples of floating cells.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.366#cpz1366-prot-0001])\nTumor cell spheroids (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.366#cpz1366-prot-0001])\nPurified mouse IgG2β, κ isotype control antibody, clone MCP-11 (e.g., Biolegend, cat. no. 402201)\nAnti-EPCAM antibody, clone 9C4 mouse IgG2β isotype (e.g., Biolegend, cat. no. 324202)\nWash medium: RMPI-1640 medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) FBS\nGoat anti-mouse (GAM) anti-isotype-specific IgG2β cross-adsorbed secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 647 (e.g., Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no.

Harvest 100 µl spheroids with a 100-µl pipette from three culture wells of the original plate, and place in a 5-ml tube. Add 3 ml DPBS without Ca2+ or Mg2+.\nThe number of wells harvested is related to the number of planned samples for flow cytometry (e.g., three wells for one sample, six wells for two samples). The protocol calls for harvesting half the volume of the well from three wells of spheroids for each sample, combining cells from different wells. This to avoid harvesting too few cells and to normalize possible variations in the number of cells present in each well.\n2. Centrifuge 5 to 10 min at 700 × g, room temperature.\n3. Discard supernatant and gently resuspend pellet by adding 5 ml DPBS without Ca2+ or Mg2+ and gently shaking the tube. Repeat centrifugation.",
    "4. Discard supernatant and add DPBS without Ca2+ or Mg2+. Keep at room temperature for 10 min, resuspending solution by pipetting up and down twice. Repeat centrifugation, and resuspend pellet in DPBS without Ca2+ or Mg2+.\n5. Place 20 µl solution in a disposable counting chamber. Check if cells are disaggregated using a microscope and count cells.\nAssess antigen expression\n6. Adjust concentration to 104 to 105 cells per 100 µl in RPMI-1640 medium, and prepare two tubes with 100 µl cell suspension: one for the negative control and one for the epithelial cellular adhesion molecule (EPCAM) immunofluorescence assay.\n7. To the negative control, add 20 µl of 2.5 μg/ml negative control antibody (isotype IgG2β control). To the second tube, add 20 anti-EPCAM antibody.\n8. Incubate at 4°C on ice for 15 to 30 min.\n9. Add 2 ml wash medium (4°C) to each tube, and centrifuge 5 to 10 min at 700 × g, 4°C. Discard supernatant and repeat this step.\n10. Dry pellet by inverting tube on blotting paper. Resuspend pellet by gently tapping the tube bottom.\n11. Add 10 µl of 2 μg/ml GAM anti-isotype IgG2β antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647, and incubate for 15 to 30 min at 4°C on ice.\n12. Add 2 ml wash medium (4°C) to each tube, and centrifuge 5 to 10 min at 700 × g, 4°C.\n13. Discard supernatant and dry pellet by inverting tube on blotting paper. Resuspend pellet in 0.5 ml RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) FBS for flow cytometer analysis.",
    "To get maximum detection of the expression of a given antigen, the reagents (i.e., anti-EPCAM antibody and isotype-specific GAM reagent) must be correctly added to each corresponding tube. This can be performed by directly pipetting the reagents inside the pellet and by gently mixing cells after addition. Each step of the protocol should be performed strictly at 4°C on ice using all solutions at 4°C. Flow cytometry analysis can be performed at room temperature, but the samples should be kept on ice before running on the flow cytometer.\n14. Analyze expression of EPCAM antigen by running samples on a flow cytometer according to the specific procedures for the instrument.",

    "The percentage of Vδ2 T cells should increase from 0.5% to 5% on day 1 at the onset of stimulation to 30% to 50% on day 10. This percentage will increase on day 14, reaching a maximum at day 21. Usually, when stimulating unfractionated PBMCs with zoledronic acid, the percentages of Vδ2 T cells present in the culture can reach >90% to 95% on day 21. The degree of expansion of Vδ2 T cells is very strong. Vδ2 T cells represent 0.5% to 5% of the total PBMCs at the onset of this assay (500 to 5000 Vδ2 T cells/105 PBMCs per culture well). Proliferation can be detected from days 5 to 7, and the first split should be made on days 10 to 12. From this day, cell cultures should be split every 2 days or less. Thus, from a single culture well, about 5 to 7 wells can be obtained after 21 days with >90% Vδ2 T cells. To simplify, given 1000 Vδ2 T cells from a single culture well at the onset of stimulation, one will obtain 90,000 Vδ2 T cells per culture well on day 21 (i.e., 90,000 cells × 7 wells = 630,000 cells total).

    "Coculture of spheroids and the purified, expanded immune effector cells (Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.366#cpz1366-prot-0004]) is necessary to study the interaction between lymphocytes and tumor cells (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.366#cpz1366-fig-0002]). Importantly, as indicated in Strategic Planning, spheroids and immune cells should be of good condition to obtain the best results. Thus, immune cells should be prepared before tumor cell spheroids. An experimental plan should be identified beforehand, including appropriate negative and positive controls. For determining cytolytic activity of antitumor effector cells, the negative control condition is represented by spheroids cultured in the absence of immune effector cells, whereas spheroids cocultured with effector cells are the positive control. Samples should be prepared in at least triplicate, but usually six replicates are better.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ac6153d2-4911-4f94-a7f4-cdaa7644edd2/cpz1366-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nCocultures of spheroids and Vδ2 T cells.

In the presence of zoledronate, which activates Vδ2 T cell‒mediated killing, this effect is further increased, indicating that Vδ2 T cells are disintegrating the 3D structure probably by killing tumor cells.\nMaterials\nNK cells or Vδ2 T cells (see Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.366#cpz1366-prot-0004])\nRPMI-1640 medium (e.g., Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 21875091)\nTumor cell spheroids (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.366#cpz1366-prot-0001])\n5- to 15-ml tube\nCentrifuge",

Recover NK cells or Vδ2 T cells from 96-well U-bottom plates, and place in a 5- to 15-ml tube.\nThe number of effector cells present in each culture well is 0.5‒1.0 × 105; thus, the number of wells to be harvested is related to the number of replicates and the experimental conditions. It is better to harvest more culture wells than what is expected to be necessary. This is because some cells are lost during washing. Additionally, including additional replicates allows the experiment to be changed at any time without restarting the procedure.\n2. Centrifuge tubes 5 min at 700 × g, room temperature. Discard supernatant and gently resuspend cell pellets in 5 to 10 ml RPMI-1640 medium.\n3. Centrifuge tubes as in step 2.\n4. Resuspend cells in 5 to 10 ml RPMI-1640 medium and count cells.\n5. Adjust cell concentration by diluting the original volume of each tube or by centrifuging the tubes again and resuspending cells at the appropriate cell concentration.\nThe number of immune cells needed depends on how many conditions have been planned. Usually, different ratios between effector and target cells should be used. The number of tumor cells present in the culture well can be determined by recovering disintegrating spheroids and counting cells manually in a counting chamber or automatically with a flow cytometer. Alternatively, the number of tumor cells can be determined by evaluating the ATP content of triplicate wells and comparing this content to the ATP content of a defined number of tumor cells in suspension. This number can also be roughly defined as double the number of cells plated for each well at the onset of cell culture after 3 days.",
    "6. Discard 100 µl medium from each well of the spheroid plate, and add 100 µl NK cells or Vδ2 T cells.\nThe number of cells should be calibrated to obtain different effector (lymphocytes) to target (tumor cells in spheroids) ratios (e.g., 10:1, 5:1, 2:1, 1:1). The appropriate ratio should be determined in preliminary experiments.\nThe negative control is represented by spheroids only, whereas the positive control can be a specific stimulus for cytotoxicity. PHA is a good stimulus for any antitumor effector cell, and this stimulus should be used at 1 to 5 µg/ml per well (final concentration; i.e., 2 to 10 μl PHA per 200 µl/well medium; see Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.366#cpz1366-fig-0002]). Zoledronic acid at 1 to 5 µM (final) is a good stimulus for Vδ2 T cells, whereas a humanized antibody (e.g., 0.002 to 20 μg/ml EGF receptor) is an optimal stimulus for FCγRIIIA+ (CD16+) cells like NK cells. This latter stimulus can be used for Vδ2 T cells as well.\n7. Incubate plates at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 4 to 48 hr.",
    "Cytotoxicity should be determined at different time points. In preliminary experiments different incubation times should be tested (e.g., 4, 24, 48, 72 hr). It is well established that immune effector cells can kill target cells through the release of perforins and granzymes or by inducing apoptosis of target cells. The first mechanism is effective beginning a short time after the interaction between effector cells and tumor target cells. Induction of apoptosis is effective after a longer incubation time. Usually, perforin-/granzyme-mediated cytotoxicity is assessed after 4 hr, whereas induction of apoptosis is assessed after 24 hr incubation. A 24-hr incubation is the appropriate time to see a cytotoxic effect using spheroids. Then, shorter or longer incubation times can be used to better define the contribution of the different molecular mechanisms that lead to the killing of target cells.\n8. Monitor cocultures by microscopy and evaluate cytotoxicity (see Basic Protocol 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.366#cpz1366-prot-0006]).\nTo define the time point at which to evaluate cytotoxicity, microscopic analysis of the cocultures can be performed. Dying CRC cells can be distinguished from living spheroids because they can be seen around the spheroid mass as single cells with a round shape (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.366#cpz1366-fig-0002]). Some of the dying cells remain attached, whereas others are next to the main spheroid mass. The cytotoxic effect of immune cells on spheroids can be seen at the periphery of the spheroid but is not clearly distinguishable from the surrounding area. Indeed, at 50× magnification (10× binocular magnification and 5× objective magnification) a lot of disaggregated cells can be seen as specks of dust around a dark mass that represents the spheroid.",
    "This assay to evaluate cytotoxicity can be applied to both drugs and antitumor lymphocytes (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.366#cpz1366-fig-0003]). The basis of this assay is the ability of living tumor cells to adhere to conventional culture wells. The assay evaluates living cells directly, and thus the percentage of dying cells can be evaluated indirectly. Tumor cell spheroids are allowed to adhere to conventional culture plates, which may take several hours. Thus, the degree of cytotoxicity is determined at the end of the coculture experiments plus the time due to adhesion.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a8b213b3-58e2-4d2a-9b74-3f0cff866309/cpz1366-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nCrystal violet staining of cocultures of spheroids and effector cells and evaluation of viability of tumor cells.

Transfer 100 µl cell suspension to a corresponding well of a conventional culture plate.\n3. To each well of the conventional culture plate, add 100 µl RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS.\n4. Incubate plate at 37°C, 5% CO2 until the living cells adhere to the plate, monitoring cultures under a microscope.\n5. Gently harvest the total volume (200 µl) of each well, and add 200 µl DPBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+. Gently resuspend each well, and then discard the 200 µl.\nThis step is performed to remove all nonadherent cells from the culture well. After removing the DPBS, only firmly adherent cells will be found in the culture well.\n6. To each well add 200 µl of 70% ethanol, and incubate plate at 4°C for 30 min.\n7. Discard the total volume of each well, and add 100 µl crystal violet. Incubate at 37°C for 30 min.\n8. Discard the total volume of each well, and add 200 µl DPBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+. Discard the 200 µl from each well, and repeat this step at least three times.\n9. Discard the total volume of each well, and tap plate on paper to eliminate any drop from each well. Move plate to fume hood.",
    "Using a microscope, check that cells are actually adherent to the cell culture plate throughout the assay. This is relevant at step 4 during the adhering phase, at step 6 before and after fixing with ethanol, at step 9 after staining with crystal violet, and at step 10 after solubilization. At any of these steps, cells that have not firmly adhered to the plastic surface can detach and can be lost during washes. It is convenient to take images after staining with crystal violet because the number of living cells can be counted in the image and because solubilization of crystal violet can be observed (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.366#cpz1366-fig-0003]).\n10. To each well add 100 µl solubilizing solution, and put plate on a shaker or gently tap the sides to allow the elution of crystal violet from cells in each well.\n11. Measure intensity of the dark blue color using a plate reader at an optical density at 594 nm (OD594; Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.366#cpz1366-fig-0003]).\nThe dark blue color is stronger in culture wells in which more cells are present. Negative controls, represented by the only-spheroid condition, will have stronger staining, whereas the positive control, represented by spheroids with immune effector cells and PHA, will have weaker staining."
