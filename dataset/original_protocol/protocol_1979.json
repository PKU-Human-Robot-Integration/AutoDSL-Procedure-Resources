    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIsolation of mitochondria\nTiming: 1–2 h\nPrior to measurement of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymatic activities, mitochondria are prepared by differential centrifugation as described below.\nCritical: samples must always be kept on ice, even during the homogenization step, using ice-cold buffers to minimize protein degradation.\nHomogenize samples in 2–3 mL of MS buffer with BSA, with 15–20 strokes at 1,000 rpm in a motor driven Teflon-glass Elvehjem potter on ice. Make sure the samples are always cold to avoid protein degradation.\nNote: if a motor driven potter is not available, use a Dounce glass potter with a loose-fitting glass pestle for adults and third instar larvae and a tight-fitting glass pestle for thoraces and small larvae.\nCritical: during the homogenization step, apply the same number of strokes to all the samples to obtain consistent results.\nTransfer the homogenate to a clean 30 mL centrifuge tube, rinse the potter with 7 mL of MS buffer with BSA and transfer to the tube with homogenate.\nCentrifuge the homogenate at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, to separate the liquid phase from debris, i.e., unbroken cells and nuclei.\nCritical: centrifuge steps must be performed at 4°C to minimize sample degradation.\nFilter supernatant through a 100 μm strainer and transfer it into a new tube.\nNote: filtering step is needed to remove legs, wings and cuticle debris that tend to float after homogenization.\nCentrifuge samples at 6,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to pellet the mitochondrial fraction.\nCritical: After the centrifugation steps, lipids are present as a white layer adhering to the tube walls. Make sure to remove lipids during the washing steps to avoid interference during measurement of enzymatic activities.",
    "Discard supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 10 mL of MS buffer with BSA. Repeat step 5.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 10 mL of MS buffer without BSA.\nCentrifuge samples at 7,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 300–400 μL of MS buffer without BSA.\nMeasure protein concentration with method of choice (e.g., Bradford, Lowry, or BCA).\nNote: protein concentration should be measured in triplicate setting up a standard curve, to achieve good consistence and reliability of the results.\nNote: this procedure yields crude mitochondrial fractions. Samples can be stored at −80°C for maximum 3 months. Avoid multiple freeze and thaw cycles of pellets to minimize degradation of protein complexes that can result in artifactual reduction of enzyme activities. Isolated mitochondria preparations can be stored in aliquots to avoid multiple freeze and thaw cycles.\nPause point: Proceed with protocol or store samples at −80°C for up to 3 months.\nDisruption of mitochondrial membranes\nTiming: 0.5 h\nPrior to the activity assays, mitochondrial membranes need to be disrupted in order to allow access of the substrates to the MRC enzyme complexes.\nPellet isolated mitochondria by centrifuging samples at 7,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nNote: depending on the type and the number of assays to be performed, evaluate the total amount of mitochondria needed for the experiment. For further details on the amounts of mitochondria needed for each assay, check the specific protocols below.\nCarefully discard supernatant and resuspend the pellet with hypotonic buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6) at 1 μg/μL final protein concentration.\nSnap-freeze in liquid nitrogen. Thaw at 25°C in a benchtop thermo shaker or, alternatively, in a water bath. Perform three freeze-thaw cycles to enhance mitochondrial membrane disruption.",
    "Note: At this point, mitochondria should be immediately used, do not freeze them. Keep samples on ice during the enzymatic activity assays.\nMeasurement of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymatic activities\nThe general concept behind measurement of the mitochondrial respiratory chain activities is to follow each enzymatic reaction through time. The enzyme kinetics is assessed via spectrophotometry by following variations in the UV-VIS absorbance of colorimetric substrates or reaction products. To date, most of UV-VIS plate readers and standard cuvette spectrophotometer can be set up to register absorbance during a time period.\nIf a 96-well plate is used, as described in this protocol, we suggest following kinetic activity by registering absorbance values for 2 min, every 20 or 30 s, depending on the number of samples measured and reading speed of the plate reader at the desired wavelength. A plate reader is highly advised to measure multiple samples at the same time and to save reagents, as assays are carried out in 200 μL of reaction volume. If a standard cuvette spectrophotometer is used, adjust the reaction volume as needed.\nNote: the measurement of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymatic activities should be carried out at 30°C.\nNote: allow reaction buffers to warm up at 20°C–25°C before the assays.\nNote: enzyme activities should be measured at least in triplicate plus at least one replicate reaction in presence of a selective inhibitor to calculate specific activity.\nMeasurement of complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) activity\nTiming: 0.5–1 h\nComplex I is a NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. Complex I is a starting point of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, the other being Complex II and other FADH2-dependent enzymes. It oxidizes NADH generated by the Krebs cycle in the mitochondrial matrix, passing two electrons through one flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and a series of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters, to the electron carrier CoQ.",
    "The activity of complex I is measured through a direct method, following the decrease in absorbance at λ=340 nm due to the oxidation of NADH, carried out by the enzyme (Estornell et al., 1993[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Spinazzi et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nFor each replicate plus one (to ensure there is enough for all the samples), prepare the reaction mix as described in the following table:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1577_4.csv\nAdd 186 μL of the reaction mix into each well of a 96- well plate (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]), using a multichannel pipette.\nAdd 10 μL of mitochondrial lysate from step 13 (1 μg/μL) and mix well.\nRecord baseline activity at λ=340 nm for 2 min at 30°C.\nAdd 4 μL of 4 mM CoQ1 (final concentration 80 μM) to each well to start the reaction. Make sure the substrate is mixed well in the reaction mix.\nPromptly record the absorbance at λ=340 nm for 2 min at 30°C.\n∗To assess rotenone sensitive NADH-dehydrogenase activity (specific to mitochondrial complex I), perform parallel reactions in presence and absence of rotenone (complex I inhibitor).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1577-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Expected outcomes for enzymatic activity assays\n(A) Complex I activity recordings of wild-type mitochondria in absence (Mito) or presence of the inhibitor (Mito + rotenone), plus recording of mitochondria from complex I subunit ND-18 (Ndufs4) gene knockdown D. melanogaster individuals (Mito CI KD), (Foriel et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\n(B) Complex II activity recordings of wild-type mitochondria in absence (Mito) or presence of the inhibitor (Mito + Malonate).\n(C) Complex III activity recording of wild-type mitochondria in absence (Mito) or presence of the inhibitor (Mito + Antimycin A) plus recording of mitochondria from complex III assembly factor Bcs1 gene knockdown D. melanogaster individuals (Mito CIII KD), (Brischigliaro et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).",
    "(D) Complex IV activity recording of wild-type mitochondria in absence (Mito) or presence of the inhibitor (Mito + KCN) plus recording of mitochondria from complex IV assembly factor Coa8 gene knockdown D. melanogaster individuals (Mito CIV KD), (Brischigliaro et al., 2019).\n(E) Complex V activity recordings of wild-type mitochondria in absence (Mito) or presence of the inhibitor (Mito + Oligomycin).\n(F) CS activity recordings of wild-type mitochondria (Mito).\nNote: expected results are reported in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A.\nMeasurement of complex II (succinate:coenzyme Q oxidoreductase) activity\nTiming: 0.5–1 h\nComplex II is a succinate:coenzyme Q oxidoreductase - succinate dehydrogenase - that oxidizes succinate to fumarate during the sixth step of the TCA cycle in the mitochondrial matrix. It couples the oxidation to the reduction of the electron carrier CoQ. The activity of complex II is measured through an indirect method following the decrease in absorbance at λ=600 nm due to the reduction of DCPIP. DCPIP is reduced by CoQ1 from the transfer of electrons from succinate to CoQ through the activity of complex II (Trounce et al., 1996[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Spinazzi et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nFor each replicate plus one, prepare the reaction mix as described in the following table:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1577_5.csv\nAdd 196 μL of the reaction mix into each well of a 96- well plate (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]), using a multichannel pipette.\nAdd 2 μL of mitochondrial lysate from step 13 (1 μg/μL) and mix well.\nShake the plate for 5 s.\nPre-incubate the plate at 25°C for 10 min.\nRecord baseline activity at λ=600 nm for 2 min at 30°C.\nAdd 2 μL of 4 mM CoQ1 (final concentration 40 μM) to each well to start the reaction.\nShake the plate for 5 s, wait for 5 s.\nRecord absorbance at λ=600 nm for 2 min at 30°C.",
    "∗To subtract the contribution of unspecific reactions, perform parallel reactions in presence and absence of malonate (complex II inhibitor).\nNote: During complex II activity assay, baseline activity reflects succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, as complex II is able to reduce DCPIP when CoQ1 is not present, although at slower rate.\nNote: Expected results are reported in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B.\nMeasurement of complex III (ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase) activity\nTiming: 0.5–1 h\nComplex III, also known as cytochrome bc1 complex, is a ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase that catalyzes the electron transfer from ubiquinol (CoQ) to the second mobile electron carrier of the MRC, cytochrome c. The activity of complex III is measured through a direct method, following the increase in absorbance at λ=550 nm due to the reduction of cytochrome c, carried out by the enzyme (Trounce et al., 1996[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Spinazzi et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nFor each replicate plus one, prepare the reaction mix as described in the following table:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1577_6.csv\nAdd 196 μL of the reaction mix into each well of a 96- well plate (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]), using a multichannel pipette.\nAdd 2 μL of mitochondrial lysate from step 13 (1 μg/μL) and mix well.\nShake the plate for 5 s, wait for 5 s.\nRecord baseline activity at λ=550 nm within 2 min at 30°C.\nAdd 2 μL of 10 mM decylubiquinol (final concentration 100 μM) to each well to start the reaction.\nShake the plate for 5 s, wait for 5 s.\nRecord absorbance at λ=550 nm for 2 min at 30°C.\n∗To subtract the contribution of possible unspecific reactions, perform parallel reactions in presence and absence of antimycin A (complex III inhibitor).",
    "Note: It is crucial that the cytochrome c used for this assay is the product with Merk catalog number C7752, or similar (prepared with acetic acid without using TCA). Other kinds of cytochrome c isolated using other methods result in very high rates of unspecific cytochrome c reduction, greatly interfering with the assay.\nNote: expected results are reported in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C.\nMeasurement of complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) activity\nTiming: 0.5–1 h\nComplex IV, or cytochrome c oxidase, is the terminal enzyme of the ETC. It catalyzes the oxidation of cytochrome c and the reduction of molecular oxygen (O2) to water (H2O). The activity of complex IV is measured through a direct method, following the decrease in absorbance at λ=550 nm due to the oxidation of reduced cytochrome c, carried out by the enzyme (Wharton and Tzagoloff, 1967[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Trounce et al., 1996[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Spinazzi et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nFor each replicate plus one, prepare the reaction mix as described in the following table:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1577_7.csv\nAdd 198 μL of the reaction mix into each well of a 96- well plate (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]), using a multichannel pipette.\nShake the plate for 5 s, wait for 5 s.\nRecord baseline activity at λ=550 nm within 2 min at 30°C.\nAdd 2 μL of mitochondrial lysate from step 13 (1 μg/μL), which will start the reaction. Mix well.\nShake the plate for 5 s, wait for 5 s.\nRecord absorbance at λ=550 nm for 2 min at 30°C.\n∗To subtract the possible contribution of unspecific reactions, perform parallel reactions in presence and absence of KCN (complex IV inhibitor).\nNote: expected results are reported in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D.\nMeasurement of complex V (ATP synthase) activity\nTiming: 0.5–1 h",
    "Complex V is a F-type ATP synthase. It is a rotary enzyme that couples proton translocation, driven by the proton motive force (PMF) generated by proton translocation at the level of complexes I, III and IV, with ATP synthesis. It is also known as FOF1- ATP synthase.\nNote: currently, no kinetic spectrophotometry-based methods are available for directly assessing ATP synthesis by ATP synthase. Therefore, the most commonly used methods are based on the evaluation of the reverse activity (ATP hydrolysis) of the enzyme, which have been proven useful to determine Complex V activity in isolated mitochondrial samples. A luminometric assay for measuring mitochondrial ATP synthesis was described before (Vives-Bauza et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nThis activity is measured through an indirect method by linking its ATPase activity to NADH oxidation. Firstly, in presence of ADP (resulting from hydrolytic activity of ATP synthase), PEP is converted to pyruvate + ATP by pyruvate kinase. Then, pyruvate is converted to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase, through the oxidation of NADH, which is what this assay determines by measuring the decrease in absorbance at λ=340 nm.\nFor each replicate plus one, prepare the reaction mix as described in the following table:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1577_8.csv\nAdd 177 μL of the reaction mix into each well of a 96 well plate (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]), using a multichannel pipette.\nAdd 3 μL of mitochondrial lysate from step 13 (1 μg/μL) and mix well.\nPre-incubate at 25°C for 5 min.\nRecord baseline activity at λ=340 nm within 2 min at 30°C.\nAdd 20 μL of 25 mM ATP pH 7.0 (final concentration 2.5 mM) to each well to start the reaction.\nRecord absorbance at λ=340 nm for 2 min at 30°C.\n∗To subtract the possible contribution of unspecific reactions, perform parallel reactions in presence and absence of oligomycin (complex V inhibitor).",
    "Note: expected results are reported in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E.\nMeasurement of citrate synthase activity\nTiming: 0.5–1 h\nCitrate synthase catalyzes the condensation of acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate to form citrate during the first step of the Krebs cycle in the mitochondrial matrix. The activity of citrate synthase is often used as a reliable method of normalization of MRC activity assays. The activity of citrate synthase is measured through an indirect method, following the formation of a yellow-colored thionitrobenzoate (TNB) derivative of DTNB by measuring the changes in absorbance at λ=412 nm. DTNB spontaneously forms TNB by reacting with sulfhydryl groups of free coenzyme A resulting from citrate synthase activity (Srere, 1969[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Trounce et al., 1996[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Spinazzi et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nFor each replicate plus one, prepare the reaction mix as described in the following table:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1577_9.csv\nAdd 188 μL of the reaction mix into each well of a 96 well plate (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]), using a multichannel pipette.\nAdd 2 μL of mitochondrial lysate from step 13 (1 μg/μL) and mix well.\nRecord baseline activity at λ=412 nm within 2 min at 30°C.\nAdd 10 μL of 10 mM oxaloacetate (final concentration 500 μM) to each well to start the reaction.\nRecord absorbance at λ=412 nm for 2 min at 30°C.\nNote: expected results are reported in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F."
