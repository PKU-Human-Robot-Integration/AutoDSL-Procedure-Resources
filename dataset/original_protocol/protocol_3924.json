    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCell labeling\nTiming: 4–5 days\nThe dynamics of chromatin could be detected as the dynamics of linker histone H1. The cells should be labeled with H1-GFP, which will be tested by FRAP. Another marker for heterochromatin HP1α-cherry is used to indicate heterochromatin foci. Then, test genes could be overexpressed or knockdown in the test cell to detect the effect on chromatin dynamics in specific process, such as somatic cell reprogramming and so on (Chen et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]., Chen et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). It could also be used to test the effect of drugs on chromatin dynamics and so on.\nCollect virus coding H1-GFP and HP1α-cherry.\nSeed Plate-E cell in a 10 cm dish at proper density about 50% confluence the day before transfection.\nTransfect the cell with 10 μg plasmid encoding H1-GFP or HP1α-cherry, mixing with 40 μL PEI (1 mg/mL) per dish.\nCollect the culture medium containing virus 48 h after transfection and remove cell fragments with a 0.45 μm sterile filter.\nRepeat the virus collection once 24 h later after replacing fresh medium. It can be stored in 4°C for about 1 week. For long time storage, it could be kept in −80°C within 1 year.\nLabeling cells.\nSeed the model cells (MEF cells in this protocol) on a 6 cm cell culture dish.\nAdd polybrene (6 ng/μL in final concentration) to the virus medium to improve the infection efficiency.\nLabel the MEF cell by adding the 5 mL virus medium containing retrovirus coding H1-GFP and HP1α-Cherry. The amount of H1-GFP should be more than HP1α-cherry, such as 4 mL H1-GFP and 1 mL HP1α-cherry virus medium.",
    "Repeat the infection step with 4 mL fresh virus medium containing only H1-GFP 24 h after the first infection to improve the expression level of H1-GFP (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nReplace with fresh culture medium 12 h after the secondary infection.\nCheck the transfection efficiency with fluorescence microscope 48–60 h after first infection.\nTest genes overexpression or knockdown.\nSeed the MEF cells in a 6-well dish after labeled with H1-GFP and HP1α-cherry.\nInfects the model cells with virus encoding test gene 12 h after seeding the model cells.\nRepeat the infection step once more to improve the efficiency 24 h after the first infection.\nCritical: The virus amount of H1-GFP and HP1α-cherry could be adjusted to ensure the brightness of H1-GFP, but keep a minimal signal of HP1α-cherry. The labeling efficiency should be checked under a fluorescence microscope to make sure most of the cells are labeled with both H1-GFP and HP1α-cherry.\nPause point: We carried out the FRAP imaging as soon as MEF cells labeled, which should only be used within about 5 passages after labeling with H1-GFP and HP1α-cherry as it would become senescence after several passages. The human fibroblast or other cell lines could be stored in liquid nitrogen and used for a long time after labeling with H1-GFP and HP1α-cherry in step 2.\nFRAP imaging\nTiming: 2–3 h\nThe dynamics of chromatin is detected by the recovery rate linker histone H1 after photobleaching (FRAP). The chromatin could be distinguished by heterochromatin marker with HP1α and euchromatin without HP1α-cherry fluorescence. The dynamics of these two groups of chromatins could be recorded separately.",
    "Seed the cells on a new confocal dish with glass bottom precoated with 0.1% gelatin or seed on a confocal dish precoated with Poly-D-Lysine (FD35PDL-100, WPI) for cells attaching not well on glass after labeling with H1-GFP and HP1α-Cherry (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A–1C). Culture the cell in the normal condition at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 24–48 h before imaging.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/893-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Setup for FRAP imaging\n(A) Seed cells on a focal dish with glass bottom.\n(B) Put the dish on a 10 cm dish to avoid split out.\n(C) Put the dish in a carried-on incubator before imaging.\n(D) Put the dish on the stage of microscope with an incubator system.\n(E) Setup the confocal microscope for imaging and FRAP.\nPut the dish on the stage of the confocal microscope and prewarmed for 5–10 min (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D). High magnification lens, such as 63× or 100× oil objective (N.A.≥1.4) lens should be used.\nFind the focus and adjust the setting of the confocal microscope (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E). To improve the acquiring rate, the frame size could be set as no more than 512×512 pixels. Make sure the acquisition time should be less than 1 s for each frame with a single-channel acquisition model. Here is the detail of setup for imaging using Zeiss LSM880 as example (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nOpen the software of Zen 3 black edition\nClick acquisition bottom.\nChoose “Time series”, “Bleaching” and “Regions”.\nSet the argon laser (or 488 nm laser) and 561 nm laser on.\nSetup two trackers for imaging, one for EGFP and another for mCherry with proper filter, such as MBS 488/561.",
    "Setup the laser power and gain value. The 488 nm laser power for EGFP should be as lower as possible, such as 0.2% for laser power, while 680 for gain value (using a GaAsP PMT).\nAdjust the imaging scale and set the zoom factor as 3 for 63× objective lens or 2 for 100× objective lens. h. Adjust the focus.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. FRAP imaging (steps 6–9)\nAcquiring a two-channel image including H1-GFP and HP1α-cherry at first (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). This image could be used to select interesting regions for bleaching. Select about 2 to 3 regions with 20 pixels in diameter (less than 2 μm) for bleaching. Select 1 region of heterochromatin foci marked with HP1α or 1-2 non-foci regions (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). The diameter of all regions should be the same.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/893-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Region selection for FRAP\nThe regions marked with HP1α are selected as heterochromatin foci, while the other regions are euchromatin. Scale bar, 5 μm. Adapted with permission from Chen et al., 2020.\nSelect a small region for FRAP, such as a round region with 20 pixels (less than 2 μm) in diameter for bleaching. A 488 nm Argon laser could be used to bleach the H1-GFP signal. Adjust the laser power and bleach time length to improve bleaching efficiency. The bleaching efficiency should be at least 70%. Here is the detail for FRAP setup (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nSet the regions for bleaching; Click the round tool to add a round region on the image acquired on step 7. Set both the width and height as 20. The size of regions could be adjusted for different cells or different propose, but it should be kept the same in the same experiments or repeats in different groups.",
    "Unfold the bleaching tool bar, and set the “Start Bleaching after # scans” as 5 and “Repeat bleach after # scans” as 12.\nChoose 488 nm laser for bleaching and adjust the bleaching laser power. Click the “Test Bleach” to find the popper laser power or directly click “start experiment” to acquire a FRAP movie and evaluate the bleaching efficiency. The bleaching efficiency should be at least 70%. The setting for bleaching should not be changed in the whole experiment after finding a proper setting.\nOpen the setting bar of “Time Series”, set the cycles as 200 and interval as 1.0 s.\nOpen the setting bar of “definite focus” and choose “defined” model to keep focus.\nAdjust the setting on the microscope and make sure only acquiring a single channel image as H1-GFP (Click off the tracker for acquiring HP1α-cherry, Movie S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). Record the image series containing 5 frames before bleaching and 2–3 min time-lapse images after bleaching.\nCritical: Before the imaging work, replace the cell with fresh cell culture medium. The incubation system on the microscope should be settled at least 10 min before the experiments. The fraction of temperature will shift the focus on time-lapse imaging. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nChoose the cell with proper H1-GFP signal level. Too weak the signal of H1-GFP may easily get photobleached. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nFluorescence intensity measurement\nThe image J software could be used to quantify the fluorescence intensity with raw images of FRAP acquired by confocal microscope. The times-lapse FRAP images might have some drift both from system drift or cell movement, which should be corrected. The fluorescence intensity of bleached regions could be quantified after drift correction.\nDrift correction\nOpen the raw images with Fiji image J (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nCrop an interesting region containing one cell or only one nucleus.",
    "Correct the image shift and rotation with TurboReg and StackReg tool. Select the tool as following. Image J > Plugins > StackReg.\nFind the bleached regions.\nFind the bleached regions with the ROI manager tool. Click the selecting tool on the main panel of image J. Draw a circle with 20 pixels in diameter as follows. Analyze>ROI manager>More>specify. Click ‘oval’ and set the diameter as 20 pixels, the same size as photobleaching setup.\nMove the selecting circle to the bleached region at the fifth frame. Click ‘update’ on the ROI manager tool window.\nAdd a circle at the non-nuclear region as background.\nMeasure the fluorescence intensity in the selected regions.\nOpen the Multi-measure tool as following. Plugins>Multi Measure.\nSelect all the circles and add them to the multi-measure box using the tool of add<SP> in this window of this plugin.\nClick Multi-Measure on the tool window of the multi-measure plugin. The intensity of the regions will be shown in a new window.\nCopy the data and paste it into a new work sheet of excel (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_893_2.csv\nOptional: Image J with proper plugins for recognizing the raw images generated by the confocal microscope could also be used.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2. Drift correction and fluorescence intensity measurement (steps 10–12)\nFRAP curve\nFluorescence intensity calculation.\nThe fluorescence intensity of FRAP regions should subtract the background intensity at first (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nCalculate fluorescence intensity before bleaching region with the average fluorescence intensity in the test region with the first 5 frames.\nCalculate the relative fluorescence intensity. Use the fluorescence intensity of regions after bleaching relative to the average fluorescence intensity of the same region in the 5 frames of images before bleaching.\nConstruct FRAP curve.",
    "Combine all the relative fluorescence intensity data from heterochromatin regions in one group, and the data from euchromatin in another group.\nOpen the GraphPad software. Choose the “XY” model in graph construction (New table and graph>XY>Choose a graph>Connecting line only). Input the correct number of repeat value in “Y”. Choose “Mean and Error” and “SEM” in the dialog. Click “Create” to start.\nPaste the time point in the “X” and paste all the relative fluorescence intensity data column by column. the software will calculate the mean value and SEM of the relative fluorescence intensity of heterochromatin or euchromatin automatically.\nConstruct the FRAP curve using GraphPad Prism by click “Graphs>Date”, (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Adjust the setup of connecting line and error bar.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/893-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. FRAP curve of H1-GFP in MEF cells\nThe mobile fraction (MF) and immobile fraction (IF) of heterochromatin and euchromatin is marked. The data were represented as mean ± SEM (n=12 for heterochromatin regions, and n=15 for euchromatin regions).\nStatistical Analysis\nTwo tailed student t-test could be used in statistical analysis with GraphPad Prism (Melcer et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nThe recovery ratio at 120 s after bleaching could also be used to evaluate the percentage of the mobile fraction (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nOptional: The FRAP curve could also be constructed with Microsoft Excel in a similar way. The mean value and SEM/SD value could be calculated on Excel. Select the mean value of relative recovery rate and construct a line graph by using “Scatter and smooth line” model (Excel>Inset>Charts>Scatter>Scatter and smooth line). The error bar could be added by using the SEM or SD value.\nNote: Three Plugins as StackReg, TurboReg and Multi-Measure should be installed.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S3.
