As C. elegans germ cells depend on GG-NER to overcome UV-induced DNA damage, embryonic survival in this assay reflects GG-NER capacity (Lans et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Sabatella et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]). The assay takes five days in total. Below, in steps 1 to 29, we describe in detail each consecutive step to be performed in chronological order. In a typical germ cell and embryo UV survival assay, we irradiate with 20, 40, 80 and 120 J/m2 UVB and include a non-irradiated control. Per strain, four OP50-seeded plates are needed for culturing of a synchronized population after which for each dose an unseeded 90 mm NGM plate is needed for irradiation and one OP50-seeded 90 mm NGM plate for recovery and five HT115(DE3)-seeded 60 mm plates for egg laying. Thus, per strain this is nine OP50 90 mm plates, five unseeded NGM 90 mm plates and 25 HT115(DE3) 60 mm plates. The number of plates used per experiment is listed in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\nDay 1: Bleaching C. elegans to synchronize life cycle.\nTiming: 0.5–1 h\nStart with a single 90 mm NGM plate per strain, full of well fed, gravid adult animals. Wash off the worms with 2 mL of M9 buffer and transfer the worms to a 2 mL tube.\nPellet the worms by spinning down at 400 g for 2 min.",
    "Critical: If the supernatant is not clear, wash the worms by removing the supernatant and adding again 2 mL of M9 buffer and spinning down. Repeat this step until the supernatant is a clear solution. Bacteria often cause the solution to be troubled and could negatively affect the bleaching. Alternative to spinning down, adult worms can be pelleted by gravity.\nRemove the supernatant until 500 μL of M9 buffer with worms per tube is left.\nNote: Supernatant can be removed by suction using a pipette or vacuum aspirator.\nPrepare fresh NaClO/NaOH solution by mixing 750 μL NaClO with 500 μL NaOH (see materials and equipment).\nNote: NaOH (sodium hydroxide) is a strong base and therefore is very corrosive. Avoid contact with eyes and skin as it can cause blindness and irritation to the skin due to skin burns. Therefore, use eye protection and gloves.\nNote: NaClO (sodium hypochlorite) is corrosive and can causes severe skin burns and eye damage. Therefore, use eye protection and gloves.\nAdd 250 μL NaClO/NaOH to the 500 μL M9 buffer with worms. Vortex this mixture and wait until the adult worms dissolve and only the eggs remain, which can be checked under the microscope.\nNote: This step takes approximately 3–4 min, depending on e.g., the strength and freshness of the bleach solution. The egg shell protects embryos from dissolving, but if the treatment is too long or harsh, also the embryos will die.\nAdd 1 mL M9 buffer and mix thoroughly to slow down the bleaching reaction.\nSpin at 400 g for 2 min to pellet the eggs.\nWash twice by removing the supernatant, adding 1 mL of M9 buffer and spinning down for 2 min.",
    "Remove the supernatant and gently take up the eggs in 100 μL of M9 buffer. Resuspend thoroughly by tapping the side of the tube.\nPlate the eggs unto four OP50 E. coli 90 mm NGM plates by pipetting 25 μL unto each plate.\nLeave the plates shortly with the lid open for fluids to evaporate.\nIncubate for 72 h on 20°C to allow the embryos to grow into young adults.\nCritical: Some gene mutations affect embryogenesis and/or development of C. elegans. Therefore, for each strain it must be determined by visual inspection if sufficient viable eggs are present on each plate and if the worms have developed into the desired young adult stage 72 h after bleaching. If insufficient viable eggs are present, this can be overcome by bleaching more than one NGM plate with gravid adults in step 1. If after 72 h the animals are too young, a longer incubation period should be used.\nCritical: At the end of the 72 h, there should be sufficient well-fed young hermaphrodite animals. If too many eggs per plate are plated, this could cause animals to become starved, which could negatively affect their survival. Starvation can be avoided by using more plates to plate the eggs and adding not more than several hundred eggs per plate in step 10.\nDay 4: UV irradiation of young adult worms\nTiming: 1–2 h\nCollect the young adult worms from the four plates by washing the worms off each plate with 2 mL of M9 buffer and transferring the worms to a 15 mL tube.\nPellet the worms by spinning down at 400 g for 2 min.\nRemove the supernatant. Add 1 mL M9 buffer and transfer the worms to a 2 mL tube.",
    "Wash three times by adding 1 mL M9 buffer, spinning down at 400 g for 2 min and removing the supernatant.\nCritical: This step is necessary to remove any bacteria sticking to the worms. This is important as these bacteria could shield against the UVB irradiation, which then penetrates less into the worm.\nAlternatives: Spinning in a centrifuge is not necessary, especially if there are many animals, as by gravity the adult worms will also sink to form a pellet at the bottom of the tube.\nAfter the last washing step, remove the supernatant and take up the pelleted worms in 100 μL M9 buffer.\nDistribute the worms over five unseeded, i.e., without bacteria, 90 mm NGM plates.\nOptional: We use five plates as we typically UV irradiate with 4 doses (20, 40, 80, 120 J/m2 UV-B) and include a non-irradiated control. If more or less UV doses are used, adjust the number of plates accordingly.\nLeave the plates with the lid open for the liquid to evaporate.\nUVB irradiate the worms with the desired UVB dose by placing each of the plates without lid under the UVB lamp.\nCritical: Determine the exact dose (J/m2) per time unit of the UV lamp using a UV dosimeter. In case the UVB lamp needs to warm up, make sure it is already turned on. For reproducibility, be sure to always position each plate at the same spot under the UV lamp.\nNote: During UVB irradiation, it is very important to shield yourself from the UVB light, as it causes DNA damage. Shielding can easily be done by wearing protective clothes like a common lab coat to cover all the skin, face shield to protect the eyes and face, and gloves to protect the hands.",
    "Wash off the irradiated worms from the empty NGM plates with 2 mL M9 and plate the animals on five 90 mm OP50 NGM plates.\nLeave the plates with the lid open for the liquid to evaporate.\nLet the irradiated animals recover for 16 – 24 h at 20°C.\nDay 5: Egg laying\nTiming: 4–5 h\nPer UVB dose, pick five times three adult hermaphrodite worms and plate these on five 60 mm HT115(DE3) NGM plates. Thus, in total for five UV doses, 25 HT115(DE3) NGM plates are required per strain.\nLet the adult worms lay eggs for a period of 3–4 h at 20°C.\nNote: During this incubation period, the adult worms will lay eggs, which ideally should be approximately 50 eggs. However, this number can vary between strains and is often reduced if a strain is UV hypersensitive. If too many eggs are being laid, counting will be tedious. This can be avoided by plating fewer adult animals per plate or by reducing the time allowed for egg laying. If too few eggs are laid, the results are not reliable. This can be avoided by plating more irradiated worms per 60 mm plate such that more eggs are laid.\nRemove the adult worms from the plates by picking.\nIncubate the plates at 20°C for 16 h such that any viable eggs have time to hatch.\nDay 6: Counting\nTiming: 1–2 h\nCount for each plate the number of unhatched and hatched eggs, i.e., the number of unviable embryos and viable larvae (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/708-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

L1 larvae are shown by black arrow, L2 larvae by red, L3 larvae by purple, L4 by blue and adult by green arrow.\nThe fraction or percentage UVB survival is calculated by dividing the number of hatched eggs by the total number of eggs and worms. This is first calculated for all individual plates, after which for each dose the mean survival of the five plates is determined.\nL1 larvae UV survival assay\nIn this assay, the development of larvae after UV irradiation is determined as measure of TC-NER capacity. TC-NER is activated during transcription when RNA polymerase II is blocked by helix-distorting lesions such as those induced by UV irradiation (Lans et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). When lesions cannot be repaired, i.e., if TC-NER is deficient, transcription is impaired, which results in arrested development of the irradiated L1 larvae (Bianco and Schumacher, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Sabatella et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]). As this can be easily scored by visual inspection, in this protocol we describe how the involvement of a gene of interest in TC-NER can be tested.",
    "The assay takes four days in total. Below, in steps 30 to 37, we describe in detail each consecutive step to be performed in chronological order. Typically, in the L1 larvae UV survival assay we irradiate with 20, 40, 80 and 120 J/m2 UVB and include a non-irradiated control. Per strain, for each UVB dose five HT115(DE3) 60 mm NGM plates are needed. Thus, per strain this is 25 HT115(DE3) 60 mm plates (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nDay 1: Bleaching C. elegans plates to synchronize life cycle.\nTiming: 0.5–1 h\nStart with a single 90 mm NGM plate per strain, full of well fed, gravid adult worms. Perform steps 1 to 9 of the bleaching protocol as described above in the germ cell and embryo UV survival assay.\nNote: The bleaching procedure is similar as described above. For L1 larvae UV survival bleaching should be performed at the end of the day. Hatching of the eggs into the first larval stage takes place around 16–17 h post bleaching. Therefore, the bleaching of the worms in this L1 larvae UV survival assay should be performed 16–17 h prior to UV irradiation.\nDispense approximately 50–100 eggs, by checking under the microscope, on a 60 mm HT115(DE3) NGM plate. Add the drop just at the edge outside the bacterial lawn, so that hatched larvae can easily crawl into the food. Repeat this for five plates per UV dose per strain. This will be in total 25 plates per strain.\nCritical: Please be aware that the eggs should be dropped on the same spot on each plate, such that variations in bacterial layer are kept minimal, as bacteria around the worm can act as a protective shield from UV.\nLeave the eggs to hatch at 20°C for 16–17 h.",
    "Alternatives: Instead of letting eggs hatch on HT115(DE3) 60 mm NGM plates, eggs can also be allowed to hatch in M9 buffer (Babu and Schumacher, 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). This will provide a better way of synchronization, as starved L1 animals arrest development. Although we have never tested this experimentally, it should be considered that the lack of food may also stress the animals and therefore negatively affect survival.\nDay 2: UV irradiation of L1 larvae\nTiming: 0.5–1 h\nCheck under the microscope if the eggs have hatched into L1 larvae.\nNote: Some gene mutations affect hatching and/or development of C. elegans, because of which not all eggs may have hatched after 16–17 h. Therefore, plates should be visually inspected to determine whether eggs of each strain have hatched into L1 larvae.\nUVB irradiate the L1 larvae with the desired UVB dose by placing each of the 60 mm HT115(DE3) plates without lid under the UVB lamp.\nCritical: Determine the exact dose (J/m2) per time unit of the UV lamp using a UV dosimeter. In case the UVB lamp needs to warm up, make sure the lamp is already turned on. For reproducibility, be sure to always position each plate at the same spot under the UV lamp.\nNote: During UVB irradiation, it is very important to shield yourself from the UVB light, as it causes DNA damage. Shielding can easily be done by wearing protective clothes like a common lab coat to cover all the skin, face shield to protect the eyes and face, and gloves to protect the hands.\nLeave the L1 larvae to develop into subsequent larval stages at 20°C for 2 days.\nDay 4: Counting\nTiming: 1–2 h",
    "For each plate, count the number of developmentally arrested L1 and L2 larvae and the number of non-arrested viable L3, L4 and young adult animals. (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nAlternatives: Counting the number of different larvae can also be performed automatically using a flow cytometer designed for worms (Babu and Schumacher, 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nThe fraction or percentage UVB survival is calculated by dividing the number of arrested L1/L2 larvae by the total number of all larval stages and adult worms. This is first calculated for all individual plates, after which for each dose the mean survival of the five plates is determined."
