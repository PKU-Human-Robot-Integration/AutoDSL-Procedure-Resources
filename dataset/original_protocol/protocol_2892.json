Towards this end, the cancer\n      cells are seeded in the 6-well plate while the ECs are plated in the\n      transwell. Seed the cells that you need to characterize in the 6-well\n      plate.\n    \nDay 1: Pre-warm the media PBS, and trypsin in a 37°C water bath.\n        Clean the cell culture hood and turn on UV light for 30 min before the\n        experiment starts.\n      \n        Check the cell status and make sure that the confluences reach about\n        80%–90%.\n      \n        Remove media, wash the cells using warm PBS once, and detach the cells\n        from 10 cm dish by incubating with trypsin for 2 min.\n      \n        Add medium to trypsin in 2:1 ratio (medium: trypsin) to neutralize the\n        trypsin.\n      \n        Centrifuge cells at 200–300 × g for 5 min at room temperature\n        (22°C–27°C) to pellet cells.\n      \n        Discard the medium and re-suspend the cells with 2 mL medium for cell\n        counting.\n      \n        Seed 2 mL cancer cells with a density of 3.0 × 105 cells/mL\n        in each well of a 6-well plate. The total cell number in each well is\n        6.0 × 105 cells. This well plate contains the cancer cells\n        that will be tested for stem markers in later steps.\n      \n        Prepare a second 6-well plate by carefully putting the transwell inserts\n        in the 6-well plate. This is for loading the control or experimental\n        cells onto the insert prior to starting indirect co-culture.\n      \nCritical: Check if the insert can\n      match up with the 6-well plate before starting the experiment. The insert\n      cannot just “stand” in the well. There must be some gap between the insert\n      and the well of the 6-well plate (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\n    \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2604-Fig2.jpg",

The experimental group is\n        HMVECi-D, which tests how the ECs alter cancer stem markers. Use BON or\n        MCF-7 cells as control groups in the inserts. Culture at 37°C and 5%\n        CO2 for 24 h before starting the co-culture (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]; Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\n        table:files/protocols_protocol_2604_9.csv\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2604-Fig3.jpg\n              Figure 3.

Cancer cells are seeded in a 6-well\n              plate for 24 h (Day 1) while both cancer cells and HMVECi-D cells\n              are cultured in inserts in a second well plate for 24 h (Day1).\n              After 24 h culture, media is changed and the inserts are added to\n              6-well plates containing only cancer cells (Day 2). Inserts seeded\n              with cancer cells are controls. For seeding\n              concentrations/densities, please see Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3].\n            \nNote: Because cells need some time to\n      attach to the bottom of transwells, seed the control and experimental\n      groups in the transwells 24 h before co-culture begins.\n    \nNote: In the control group, cancer cells\n      should be cultured onto the insert.\n    \nNote: In the cancer microenvironment, the\n      cancer cell number is much higher than the number of vascular ECs.\n      Therefore, we designed two ratios between the cells in the insert (ECs or\n      cancer cells) and the cell seeded in 6-well plate (cancer cells). The\n      ratio is defined as which are cells in insert to cells in 6-well plate\n      ratio and the following ratios were tested 1:5 or 1:10.\n    \nNote: The EGM-2 medium is used for\n      HMVECi-D culture.",
    "Day 2: Aspirate the medium in the 6-well plate and transwell\n        insert.\n      \nReplace the endothelial cell medium with cancer cell medium.\nNote: Since the two cells are co-cultured,\n      the medium should be the same. The minimum recommended volume for the\n      lower chamber is 2 mL, with a maximum of 2.6 mL suggested. The minimum\n      volume for the insert is 1 mL, with a maximum of 1.5 mL.\n    \nPut the insert into the corresponding wells in the 6-well plate.\nDay 4: After 48 h co-culture, wash the cancer cells in the 6-well\n        plate twice with PBS and lyse to collect total RNA using the\n        instructions on the RNeasy Mini Kit Protocol.\n      \nNote: The manufacturer’s online protocol\n      may be found at the following link:\n      https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/rna-purification/total-rna/rneasy-kits?catno=74104[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/rna-purification/total-rna/rneasy-kits?catno=74104].\n    \n        Quantify the RNA concentration by Nanodrop and use molecular\n        biology-grade water to dilute samples as needed to maintain equal\n        concentrations.\n      \n        Prepare the mixture for reverse transcription in PCR tubes following the\n        recipe in Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4].\n        table:files/protocols_protocol_2604_10.csv\nNote: Items marked with ∗ are included in\n      the High-Capacity cDNA reverse transcriptase kit described in the KRT.\n    \nNote: The amount of RNA that can be\n      reverse transcribed is 2,000 ng based on the optimized protocol. Use up to\n      2 μg of total RNA per 20 μL reaction. Solution volumes may be scaled as\n      necessary to ensure sufficient total volume for the reaction.\n    \n        Perform RNA reverse transcription following the protocol outlined in\n        Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5].\n        table:files/protocols_protocol_2604_11.csv\nPause point: The cDNA is stable at\n      −20°C for 2 weeks; for longer storage times, −70°C storage should be\n      utilized.\n    \n        Prepare master mix for RT-qPCR reaction in PCR tubes based on\n        Table 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6].\n        table:files/protocols_protocol_2604_12.csv\nNote: Make sure the primer concentration\n      for RT-qPCR is 10 μM. The concentration of the primer from IDT is 100 μM.",
    "If users are limited in reagents, a 10 μL total volume basis could also be\n      used for the qPCR system. Reduce the volume of each reagent in\n      Table 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6] by a factor of 2.\n    \n        Run RT-qPCR following the thermocycler protocol shown in\n        Table 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl7].\n        table:files/protocols_protocol_2604_13.csv\nDirect co-culture or vasculogenic ring assay\nTiming: 7 days\n      This assay generates a small disk representing a 3D microtissue that\n      models the tumor microenvironment; each sample can contain multiple cell\n      types to permit investigations of both biochemical interactions between\n      cells as a result of secreted factors as well as biomechanical\n      interactions through cell-cell adhesions or matrix remodeling. The benefit\n      of using a PDMS ring on a glass cover slip to hold the ECM-based gels, as\n      opposed to using glass-bottom well plates, is that this configuration\n      provides a reliable and consistent geometry between studies. The sides of\n      the PDMS ring create a barrier that forms the fibrin gel into a regular\n      cylinder, rather than the hemi-spherical shape when cell-gel mixtures are\n      placed directly on a substrate. The glass coverslip also provides a way\n      the entire sample can be removed from the 24 well plate after culture,\n      permitting enhanced flexibility for how samples are processed and imaged.\n      In other words, the technique can be expanded to permit protocols such as\n      embedding in paraffin or OCT for sectioning and IHC processing similar to\n      in vivo or clinical specimens to compare\n      in vitro microtissue models to these other models.\n    \n        Prepare fibrinogen at a concentration of 20 mg/mL by diluting fibrinogen\n        powder in DPBS without Ca2+ or Mg2+.\n      \nNote: Each ring needs 50 μL fibrinogen;\n      this volume is sufficient to fill the PDMS ring, creating a cylindrical\n      disk. Calculate the amount of fibrinogen that will be needed, based on\n      total rings to be prepared. Include additional reactions in the",
    "calculations because 50% of volume can be lost during filtration.\n    \nNote: Dilute fibrinogen powder with DPBS\n      outside the hood. Let the tube containing fibrinogen incubate in 37°C\n      water bath for at least 1 h before next steps. Spin the tube at 8–10 × g\n      for 2 min at room temperature (22°C–27°C). Sterile filter the fibrinogen\n      by using syringe and 0.22 μm low-retention filter (Millex-GP SLGPR33RS)\n      (See key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) in cell\n      culture hood. Put the fibrinogen back into the 37°C water bath to keep\n      warm while harvesting cells.\n    \n        Pre-warm endothelial cell medium, BON cell medium, CAF medium, trypsin,\n        PBS, and DPBS.\n      \n        Spray 70% ethanol to clean the hood and turn on UV light to sterilize\n        the entire cell culture hood for at least 30 min.\n      \n        Transfer PDMS rings on coverslips into each well of a 24-well plate in\n        the tissue culture hood.\n      \nNote: 24-well plates should be used in the\n      experiment since the size of PDMS rings are the same as the wells in\n      24-well plate.\n    \nCritical: Since the PDMS rings\n      attached on the glass coverslips are transparent, make sure that the PDMS\n      rings face upward. Check each PDMS rings by touching them with a tweezer.\n      If the PDMS ring is facing upward correctly, you should feel the soft PDMS\n      ring instead of the rigid glass. The PDMS may provide a slight “bounce”\n      feel when the tweezers are pushed into it. The rings should remain on the\n      coverslips for the duration of the experiment.\n    \n        Harvest the cells by detaching and collecting all the cells in a 50 mL\n        tube and take 10 μL for cell counting.\n      \nNote: 0.5% trypsin can be used to detach\n      the cells from a 10 cm dish.\n    \nNote: Find the appropriate cell number in",
    "each ring. If too many cells are used, the cells in the rings will be\n      crowded and could cause gel collapse; if the cell density is not high\n      enough, the ECs and BON cells cannot proliferate in the ring. We tested\n      different cell numbers in several pilot experiments. The maximum\n      recommended number of cells per ring is 1 × 106. For more\n      information on cell density optimization, please see the\n      limitations[href=https://www.wicell.org#limitations] section below.\n    \nNote: We tested two different conditions:\n      (1) More ECs than cancer cells (5:5:1 and 10:10:1); (2) More cancer cells\n      than ECs (1:5:5 and 1:10:10). These ratios are HMEC-1:CAF:BON cells. We\n      also tested 1:5, 1:10, 5:1, and 10:1 HMEC:BON ratios.\n    \n        Resuspend BON, HMEC-1, and CAF cells at appropriate densities following\n        Table 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl8].\n        table:files/protocols_protocol_2604_14.csv\nNote: Calculate the cell number using the\n      basis of 3 rings for convenience. Each ring needs at least 100K cells,\n      which is at least 300K cells for 3 rings. Three rings need 22 μL of each\n      cell line (7.3 μL for each ring). Three rings need 66 μL of total cell\n      suspension (e.g., - 22 μL for each cell line in a tri-culture experiment).\n    \nCritical: While only a small number of\n      cells is needed in each ring, the concentration of cells is fairly high.\n      Make sure that the three cell lines are ready before starting the ring\n      assay; all of the BON, HMEC-1, and CAF cell confluence values should be\n      80%–90% in each 10 cm dish. This should ensure there are sufficient cells\n      to load 15–36 rings, depending on desired final concentration (See\n      Table 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl8]). To get these cell concentrations, count the\n      number of cells harvested, then calculate the volume of medium required to\n      dilute the cells to reach the needed concentration for the ring assay.\n    \nCritical: HMEC-1 cells cannot form",
    "blood vessel-like structure without the support of stromal cells. For\n      these studies we used CAFs.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]\n        Make cell suspensions in sterile microcentrifuge tubes for loading\n        rings.\n      \nNote: It is recommended to use 500 μL\n      tubes, as it is somewhat easier to hold them while pipetting in future\n      steps, although 1.5 mL tubes will work as well.\n    \n        Mix BON, HMEC-1 and CAF cell suspensions (22 μL for each cell type) with\n        9 μL of thrombin.\n      \nNote: Thrombin was solubilized in 0.1% BSA\n      in DPBS at 50U/mL, aliquoted at 50–100 μL per tube, and stored in −20°C\n      freezer. This solution is stable for at least 12 mo when stored properly.\n    \nCritical: Thrombin aliquots do not\n      survive multiple freeze/thaw cycles.\n    \nCritical: Mix the BON, HMEC-1, and\n      CAFs first, then add thrombin and mix thoroughly. The final volume should\n      be 75 μL.\n    \n        Add 75 μL of fibrinogen into the cell suspension, mix three times using\n        the pipette via trituration, then turn the pipette to 50 μL quickly and\n        add 50 μL to each ring, careful to not introduce bubbles.\n      \nCritical: Store the fibrinogen in a\n      37°C water bath until starting this step.\n    \nCritical: Fibrinogen quickly\n      polymerizes into fibrin upon addition of thrombin. Finish this step as\n      quickly as possible. Use a 100 μL pipette and change the volume from 75 μL\n      to 50 μL quickly. Do not change pipette tips.\n    \nNote: To prevent bubbles, avoid pressing\n      the pipette all the way down. Troubleshooting:\n      problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3] and problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\n    \nOptional: If users are having\n      difficulties with changing pipette volume quickly, prepare two pipettes:\n      one set to 75 μL, another set to 50 μL. Change the pipette immediately\n      after you mix fibrinogen three times by 75 μL pipette.\n    \n        With the dispensing button still depressed, swirl pipette tip around to\n        fully spread gel mix throughout whole ring.",
    "Note: Due to the three rings needing to be\n      finished together, the time spent on each ring should be as short as\n      possible. We recommend transferring 50 μL to each ring, then going back\n      and swirling the solutions to get even dispersion.\n    \nCritical: The mixture will begin to\n      polymerize within 30 s.\n    \n      Users should move quickly to ensure the polymerization does not happen\n      inside the pipette tip.\n    \n      Finish three rings within 30 s. Troubleshooting:\n      problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\n    \nMove to incubator and allow gels to set for up to 30 min.\nNote: Gels may sit for a maximum of 1 h\n      before media is added; any longer than 1 h and gel stability is\n      compromised, and cells may begin to die.\n    \n        Add 1 mL of EGM-2 medium in the wells with the mixture of BON, HMEC, and\n        CAF cells.\n      \nNote: Can use minimum 500 μL medium per\n      well media if necessary.\n    \n        Check the cell status every day and change media every 2 days, for\n        7 days of total culture time before proceeding to step 32.\n        Troubleshooting: problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7].\n      \nNote: Samples with both HMEC-1 cells and\n      CAFs may begin to generate vasculature structures by day 3 or 4.\n    \nNote: When discarding the medium by vacuum\n      aspiration, do not touch the cells or gels in PDMS rings with the tip of\n      aspirating tube. The fibrin gel can be aspirated by vacuum flasks. Touch\n      the wall of each well to remove the medium carefully.\n    \nNote: A manual pipette may be used if\n      preferred to remove the media.\n    \nRing assay fixation and staining\nTiming: 3 days\n      This section describes the protocol for fixation and immunofluorescence\n      (IF) staining for cells cultured in the 3D in vitro ring assay\n      described above. In addition to IF-based techniques, users should consider",
    "utilizing cell lines with fluorescent tags or reporters for proteins of\n      interest in their specific studies. Including pre-labeled markers can\n      simplify and shorten the staining process.\n    \nDay 1: Remove the 24-well plate with rings from the incubator and\n        transfer to a lab bench for histological analysis.\n      \nNote: This is Day 1 of the Staining\n      protocol and Day 8 of the co-culture protocol described in the previous\n      section.\n    \nNote: All further steps can be performed\n      in non-sterile conditions.\n    \nWash the rings with ∼500 μL PBS twice, each for 5 min.\nNote: Use a vacuum aspirator flask on the\n      bench to aspirate the media from the 24-well plate. The aspiration tube\n      tip can only touch the wall of each well to avoid disturbing the cells or\n      gel in the ring.\n    \nCritical: The vacuum flask should\n      contain 10% bleach.\n    \n        Fix the rings using 10% formalin for 20 min on an orbital shaker at room\n        temperature (22°C–27°C).\n      \nNote: Add ∼300 μL of 10% formalin in each\n      well. Remove 10% formalin by pipette and dispose according to hazardous\n      waste protocols.\n    \nNote: It is not necessary to quench after\n      fixation for immunofluorescence staining protocols.\n    \n        Wash the rings with PBS on an orbital shaker at room temperature\n        (22°C–27°C) three times, each for 5 min.\n      \nPause point: You may stop here by\n      wrapping the 24-well plate in aluminum foil and storing it at 4°C. Samples\n      may be stored for 3–4 weeks before staining.\n    \n        Prepare 2% BSA blocking buffer by dissolving 2 g BSA powder in 100 mL\n        PBS with 0.1% Tween-20.\n      \nNote: BSA dissolution in PBS may be sped\n      up by incubating at 37°C for ∼20 min.\n    \n        Remove PBS and add 200 μL blocking buffer to block for 1 h at room\n        temperature (22°C–27°C) on orbital shaker.\n      \n        Aspirate the blocking buffer. Incubate each ring with 200 μL primary",
    "antibody solution.\n      \nNote: Check the dilution for each antibody\n      to calculate total volume of antibody needed. Dilute antibody in blocking\n      buffer. Wrap the 24-well plate in aluminum foil and store at 4°C fridge\n      overnight (12–24 h) on an orbital shaker.\n    \nNote: If using multiple primary antibodies\n      to stain for multiple targets, these can be incubated simultaneously if\n      the host species are different.\n    \nDay 2: Remove the primary antibody solution and wash the rings\n        with phosphate-buffered saline/tween (PBST) four times, each wash for\n        20 min at room temperature (22°C–27°C) on the orbital shaker.\n      \nNote: PBST was prepared by 1× PBS with\n      0.1% Tween-20.\n    \n        Add 200 μL per well of secondary antibody diluted in blocking buffer.\n      \nCritical: Check the secondary antibody\n      dilution and the animal species of primary antibody. Check the fluorophore\n      color to make sure each target can be distinguished.\n    \n        Wrap the 24-well plate in aluminum foil and store at 4°C fridge\n        overnight (12–24 h) on an orbital shaker.\n      \nDay 3: Remove the secondary antibody and wash the rings with PBST\n        four times, each wash for 20 min at room temperature (22°C–27°C) on the\n        orbital shaker.\n      \n        Stain the cells with DAPI for 20–30 min at room temperature (22°C–27°C)\n        on the orbital shaker.\n      \nNote: Check the dilution concentration of\n      DAPI and the solution used for dilution.\n    \n        Discard the DAPI and wash the rings at least once, for a minimum of\n        5 min, with PBST to remove excess DAPI.\n      \n        Staining is complete and image the rings on an inverted fluorescence\n        microscope.\n      \nPause point: You can store the\n      rings at 4°C by wrapping the 24-well plate with aluminum foil. Systems\n      will retain stain for 4–6 weeks under these conditions.\n    \nRing imaging and analysis\nTiming: 1 day (imaging); variable\n      (analysis)\n    \n      This protocol describes an imaging technique for the 3D co-culture models",
    "described in the previous sections based on IF staining. Users should\n      optimize imaging parameters based on their specific targets of interest\n      and staining protocols. The analysis techniques described here were used\n      in the generation of data and figures shown in the\n      expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes] section. This is a\n      semi-quantitative technique used to provide direct comparison between\n      sample groups generated during the co-culture assay. The length of time\n      needed to complete the analysis is dependent on how many samples users\n      have in an experiment and computational capacity of users’ desktops or\n      laptops.\n    \nImage rings on inverted epifluorescence microscope.\nNote: In this study, an Olympus IX83\n      system with CellSens Dimensions software (Version 3.1) was used for image\n      collection.\n    \nNote: Z-stack images were collected for\n      each ring at 100 μm thickness and 2 μm step size. Exposure times were\n      optimized based on negative controls (no primary antibody incubation).\n      Troubleshooting: problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9].\n    \n        Project the 3D z-stacks to 2D using FIJI and the Extended Depth of Field\n        plugin for FIJI.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]\nNote: This allows for analysis of a 3D\n      volume using 2D image processing software.\n    \n        For vascular growth analysis, use AngioTool to calculate total vessel\n        growth per image area as well as average vessel length.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]\nNote: Images must first be saved as a\n      false-color JPEG to be compatible with AngioTool software.\n    \n        To ensure that stem markers observed in immunofluorescence studies are\n        associated with BON cells, we used the Just Another Colocalization\n        Plugin (JaCoP) in FIJI to determine the Pearson’s coefficient for\n        specific markers with the BON cells.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]"
