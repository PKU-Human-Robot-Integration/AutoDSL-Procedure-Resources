    "This protocol was approved and follows the animal care guidelines by the Drexel University College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Nu/Nu athymic female mice (6-8 weeks old) were used in this study.\n1. Intracranial injection of tumor cells\nSterilize all equipment (tweezers, scissors, suturing scissors, hand drill) under a dry cycle of an autoclave for up to 45 min in sterilization pouches, including a sterilization indicator. If conducting surgeries on multiple animals, sterilize tools between animals using a heated bead sterilizer (up to 3x).\nAnesthetize the mice according to the users' animal care protocol (e.g., isoflurane (4% for induction, 1-2% maintenance) and administer analgesia (subcutaneous, 0.1mL of 0.1mg/kg buprenorphine SR-LAB) prior to the start of surgery. Ensure optimal anesthesia depth with a toe pinch.\nPlace the mice into a stereotaxic frame and immobilize the head using standard ear bars (Figure 1A). Apply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes.\nSterilize the surface of the head by repeated, alternating application (3x) of iodine swabs and 70% ethanol prior to incision.\nUse a surgical scalpel to make a 1 cm midline incision through the skin at a slightly diagonal angle to the imaginary line that divides the mice's brain into two symmetrical halves to expose the skull. Wipe any blood with a cotton swab.\nDeflect the skin laterally to expose the injection site: 2 mm on the right, 1 mm forward with reference to the bregma (+2 mediolateral (+2ML), +1 rostral/caudal (+1RC).\nUse a bur bit (0.73 mm) to penetrate the skull +2ML, +1RC to the bregma and drill a hole using slight pressure and twisting motion.",
    "Use a brain injection syringe to inject 5 µL of a 100,000 MDA-MB-231BR (stably expressing GFP-Luciferase) cells/µL solution in sterile 1x PBS by initially inserting the syringe 3.5 mm in depth to the brain.\nAllow the syringe to settle for 2 min. Pull it up about 1 mm, and after 2 min, slowly inject the first half of the volume.\nWait for another 2 min before injecting the rest, and then slowly pull the syringe 3 min after the final injection.\n\tNOTE: Slow injection is empirical in allowing the volume to be well absorbed by the brain tissue and not create leakage after pulling the syringe, which may lead to cancer cells growing outside of the intended site.\nApply bone wax to the injection site on the skull and then use polypropylene sutures to suture the tissue. Mice will recover within 5 min after removal of anesthesia.\nMonitor their behavior right after surgery for about 10 min, 3 h later and the following day to determine if special treatment, including saline injection, soft food, etc., are needed to help quick recovery.\nMonitor the tumor growth via bioluminescence imaging on the imaging system.\n\t\nFor this, first, turn on the oxygen and isoflurane on the imaging system. Allow both to be distributed to the separate chamber outside of the imaging box.\nThen, turn on the software, initialize the instrument and choose the appropriate option for visualizing and capturing the whole mouse body.\nPlace the mice in the separate chamber with isoflurane and ensure optimal anesthesia depth with a toe pinch. Inject the mice intraperitoneally with 200 µL of 30 mg/mL luciferin.\nTransfer the mice stomach down to the imaging chamber's noselet supplied with oxygen and isoflurane. Lock the chamber, and choose 2 min time exposure to start imaging.",
    "Use the ROI (region of interest) tool of the software to quantify the bioluminescent signal of the tumor.\nTo analyze the tumor size, choose the circle shape tool, fit it around the tumor shape and size. Measure the ROI and report the total readings.\nAllow solid tumor growth for 12-14 days (or until luciferase reaches about 7.0 x 106 units) (Figure 1B) before generating brain slices.\n\tNOTE: Increasing the number of cells to be injected will lead to faster tumor growth; therefore, the generation of brain slices can occur earlier than 12 days. On the other hand, a bigger tumor will lead to more GFP+ slices if allowed to grow for 14 days. After 14 days, mice's health begins to deteriorate rapidly; hence animal health monitoring should be increased to once daily after the 10-day time point, and any mice displaying signs of pain and/or discomfort should be used for generating the slices.\n2. Generate brain slices\nNOTE: Perform the steps after brain isolation in a sterile laminar flow hood. It is typically possible to generate 35-40 individual slices containing tumor cells (luciferase signal) from one mouse injected with MDA-MB-231BR cells (Figure 1C).\nSterilize all the surgical tools in an autoclave. Place tissue slicer in the sterile laminar flow hood and clean all tools and instruments with 70% ethanol.\nFollowing 12-14 days after intracranial MDA-MB-231BR cell injection, anesthetize the mice according to the users' animal care protocol as described in 1.2. Ensure optimal anesthesia depth with a toe pinch.\nRemove and place their brains rapidly (within 45 s) into ice-cold (4 °C) sucrose-ACSF composed of the following: 280 mM sucrose, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 20 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM Na+-ascorbate, 3 mM thiourea, 2 mM Na+, 29 mM pyruvate; pH=7.3.",
    "Using a sharp, sterile scalpel or razor blade, cut away excess parts of the brain that do not contain any tumor from all sides, including the bottom part of the brain.\nBring the shape of the brain to a non-perfect cube to sit flat on the ACSF wetted filter paper on a 60 mm dish lid to facilitate slicing.\n\tNOTE: Extra tissue of the brain where the tumor is unlikely to have grown is removed prior to slicing to allow generation of mostly GFP+ slices and create a shape of the brain that is stable on the surface of the instrument and will not be perturbed by the vibrations caused by the slicing.\nPlace several sheets of pre-wet (with ACSF) filter paper circles onto the cutting platform and place the blocked tissue atop this.\nSet the cut size on the instrument to 2 or 2.5 units on the provided ruler to slice the tissue into 200-250 µm sections.\n\tNOTE: Slices up to 350 µm or as thin as 100 µm are viable. For slices <200 µm, use a vibratome or compresstome.\nUse a paintbrush (sable) to transfer brain slices into a dish containing sucrose ACSF and separate the slices under a light microscope using 27 G needles.\nIdentify GFP positive slices under the fluorescent microscope and transfer them to a new 60 mm dish containing 2-3 mL of adult slice media (Neurobasal medium A, 2% B12 supplement, 1% N2 supplement, 1% glutamine, 0.5% glucose, 10 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin) using a sterile 1 mL broken off pipette (wide opening).\n\tNOTE: The brain slices that contain tumor cells growing over the brain surface (maybe due to injection cell leakage, etc.) are excluded.",
    "Transfer 3-5 slices onto each 30 mm, 0.4 µm pore size tissue culture insert in 6-well plates at a distance that does not allow growing into each other.\nRemove the excess medium from the surface of the insert using a P1000 pipette, add 1 mL of adult mouse slice medium underneath each insert and equilibrate the media in the incubator prior to slicing.\nIncubate the tissues at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity for 24 h before imaging.\n3. IVIS imaging of slices\nNOTE: Perform luciferase and inhibitor addition steps in a sterile laminar flow hood.\nPipette 5 µL of 30 mg/mL luciferin solution into the medium underneath the inserts by lifting the insert with forceps and placing them back into the well after addition of luciferin to the media in the well.\nPlace the 6-well plate with the lid inside the imaging chamber of the instrument below the stationary camera and lock the chamber door.\nOpen the software and initialize the instrument.\nChoose camera settings that allow visualization and capturing of only one well per image. Move the stage up(FOV of 5 cm) and place the well that must be imaged directly under the camera.\nSet the imaging time to most appropriate depending on the intensity of the luciferase that the tumor will emit, which can vary from 10 s to 5 min. Start with setting it to 10 s and then increase if the signal is low but keep it consistent for all time points and conditions until the end of the experiment (Figure 1D).\nUse the ROI tool (circle shape tool), fit it around the tumor shape and size, measure the ROI, and report the total readings to quantify the bioluminescent signal of each tumor on the slice.",
    "Bring the plate back to the sterile laminar flow hood, use forceps to slightly lift the insert from the well.\nAspirate the medium, replace it with 1 mL of fresh medium and place the insert back in the well.\nFor experiments where the slices are being treated with various compounds such as inhibitors, metabolites, etc., prepare the appropriate concentration of the reagent in 1.2 mL of brain slice media in a 1.5 mL tube and then transfer 1 mL to the well containing the slice.\nRepeat this process every 48 h for the duration of the study.\n4. Live imaging of tumor growth in ex vivo brain slices\nNOTE: Supply inserts with enough medium (1.5 mL) to last the length of the experiment as it is not possible to add additional medium during the live imaging.\nPlace the 6-well plate on the automated microscope plate holder inside the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity).\nOpen the software, turn on brightfield on the first quadrant to adjust the exposure needed to view the slices. To find the position (coordinates \"xy\") of the slice, navigate with \"xy\" on the second quadrant to control the coordinates \"xyz\" of the microscope.\nSelect 6-well plate as the labware used for this experiment. Select the ROI map editor and register that position by selecting a new ROI, add and save that ROI.\nRepeat the same steps for all the other regions of interest in other wells. After having added all the ROIs, save all the ROIs.\nUnder Protocol, select Clear Existing and select Time-Lapse under Acquisition, followed by selecting the channels of interest (in this case GFP).",
    "Turn off Autofocus in the Focus Setup and manually adjust to the appropriate focus for all the slices. Finally, adjust the Brightfield Intensity and Fluorescent Channel Excitation and Exposure Time to the appropriate level.\nSet the protocol to acquire images every 15 min for 48 h.\nSave and run the protocol. At the finish of the experiment, the saved file will contain both the brightfield and GFP images captured for every ROI.\nTo combine the images in a video, rename all images of interest with the same name followed by a binary number to organize them in the order they were captured (e.g., ROI1 (1), RO1 (2) ...)\nOpen ImageJ and import the images by clicking on File > Import > Image Sequence. Select the file names that appear in a list, and write the content of the files' name in the File Name Contains box that will appear to identify those files selected for the video.\nSave the combined images under File > Save As > AVI.\n5. MTS assay and immunohistochemistry of ex vivo brain tissue\nMTS ASSAY\n\t\nExcise the slices by cutting the tissue culture membrane underneath each slice along the edges of the tissue and transfer the tissue, still attached to the membrane, into a 96-well plate.\nAdd the MTS reagent mixed in a 1:5 ratio with culture media and 0.01% triton (1x) to allow penetration of the solution in the tissue, in a total volume of 120 µL in each well.\nUse 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) as an agent to render brain slices inviable, and thus a positive control for this experiment. Immerse the brain slice of interest in 4% PFA for 1 h at RT (room temperature) or overnight at 4 °C before proceeding with the MTS assay.",
    "Allow the MTS reagent to react on the slices for 4 h, remove the slices from the wells and measure the absorbance at 490 nm for all conditions, including an empty well with no slice as a reference.\nReport the readings as a function of tissue slice area, measured with a digital caliper ruler.\nImmunohistochemistry preparation\n\t\nImmerse the brain slices attached to the membrane insert surface in 10% formalin overnight at 4 °C.\nPerform embedding, processing, blocking and generate unstained slides of the tissue. Use standard immunohistochemistry staining protocol to stain for H&E, Ki-67, gamma-H2AX, CC3, GFAP, GFP, DAPI\n6. Irradiation of tumor in ex vivo brain slices\nIrradiate the tumor with 6 Gy (310 kVp x-rays).\n\tNOTE: The units entered to get the total dose of 6 Gy are 3522 units after considering R units (measured using Victoreen electrometer) and corrections for the thimble, air density, and cGy/R as previously described18. The exposure time is 130.9 s.\nUse 0.25 mm Cu +1 mm Al added filtration, 50 cm SSD, 125 cGy per min.\nPerform dosimetry by an in-the-beam ionization chamber calibrated against a primary standard.\nMake corrections daily for humidity, temperature, and barometric pressure.\nSubscription Required.
