The protocol below calls for the use of HEK293T cells, but the same procedure can be readily applied to other types of cells, such as HeLa or CHO cells.\nIf transfection is needed, seed HEK293T cells at 25% density (∼1 × 106 cells/well) in 4 wells of a 6-well plate 3 days before the experiment, and transfect the cells the following day using Lipofectamine 3000 according to the manufacturer’s manual.\nIf transfection is not needed, seed HEK293T cells at 25% density in 4 wells of a 6-well plate 2 days before the flux experiment.\nMitochondrial 45Ca2+ uptake assay—Performing the assay\nTiming: 3 h\nThe steps below describe the detailed procedures to perform the mitochondrial 45Ca2+ uptake assay.\nFill 12 scintillation vials with 5 mL of WB, and place these vials on ice to keep them cold.\nSet up the vacuum filtration manifold using 0.45 μm pore size round nitrocellulose membranes. Connect the manifold to a vacuum outlet or a vacuum pump. Pass 5 mL of water through each membrane to confirm vacuum power and to wet the membrane.\nPrepare 1000× digitonin (30 mM in water) and 500× thapsigargin (2.5 mM in DMSO) stock.\nCritical: Digitonin stock solution must be freshly prepared right before the experiment. Thapsigargin stock can be stored in 4°C for up to a month.\nAdd 0.6 μL of concentrated 45Ca2+ stock (specific activity: 15–30 mCi/mg) to 0.6 mL of RB. Also, add 30-μM digitonin (to permeabilize cells) and 5-μM thapsigargin (to block the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pump).",
    "Split the solution into 2 microcentrifuge tubes. Add 100 nM Ru360 (a potent uniporter inhibitor) to one of the two tubes, labeled as tube A (no Ru360) and tube B (with Ru360).\nTrypsinize HEK293T cells in 2 wells of a 6-well plate. Resuspend the cells in 2–4 mL of DMEM (with 10% FBS), and then count cells using a hemocytometer or an automatic cell counter.\nCritical: It is important to apply adequate trypsinization to break large cell clumps, or cell counting would be inaccurate.\nTransfer 4 × 106 cells to a microcentrifuge tube, spin down at 2000 g for 1 min, resuspend the cell in 1 mL of WB, and then spin down again at 2000 g for 1 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 200 μL of WB, supplemented with 30-μM digitonin and 5-μM thapsigargin. Allow the cells to be permeabilized for at least 2 min before proceeding to step 11.\nAdd 100 μL of the cell suspension to tube A and mix well to start mitochondrial 45Ca2+ uptake. 1 min later, add 100 μL of the remaining cell suspension to tube B to start 45Ca2+ uptake in this tube.\n2 min, 4 min, and 6 min after 45Ca2+ uptake started, transfer 100 μL of each sample into the respective scintillation vials with ice-cold WB. Immediately filter the mix through the vacuum manifold.\nOnce the solution is filtered through, immediately filter through 5 mL of WB to remove any remaining extramitochondrial 45Ca2+. 6 membranes would be used in steps 6–13 (3-time points for both tubes A and B).",
    "Transfer the membranes into empty scintillation vials and add 15 mL scintillation cocktail for counting. Also, transfer 10 μL of remaining solutions from tube A and tube B into different scintillation vials and add 15-mL scintillation cocktail for counting.\nCritical: Shake those scintillation vials with membranes vigorously for at least 30 s to fully extract 45Ca2+ into the scintillation cocktail.\nRepeat steps 6–14 for technical replicates. There should be two membranes for each time point for both tubes A and B.\nMeasure the counts (CPM) in each vial using a scintillation counter.\nCalculate the average of the two readings for each time point to generate a single data point. Multiply the signal from 10 μL of the remaining solution by 10 to obtain the total signal in 100 μL solution.\nFollow the instructions in the Expected Outcomes section below to analyze the data.\nElectrical recordings using Xenopus oocytes—Preparing cRNA\nTiming: 10 h\nThese steps provide instructions about how to prepare cRNA to express the uniporter’s transmembrane subunits in Xenopus oocytes.\nLinearize 10 μg of a pOX vector containing a human MCU-EMRE (hME, Addgene 178181) fusion construct (MCU and EMRE form the uniporter’s transmembrane region) using 20 U of the NotI-HF restriction enzyme.\nDigest hME-pOX for 6 h at 37°C, followed by heat inactivation for 20 min at 65°C using a thermal cycler.\nPause point: The DNA can be left in the thermal cycler at 4°C, with the next steps performed in the following day.\nConfirm complete linearization of the hME vector by running the sample on a 1% DNA gel. A fully linearized sample should run as a single band, as opposed to linearized samples, which show a smear due to DNA supercoiling (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1198-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Linearization of hME-pOX",
    "The middle lane is nonlinearized sample, while the right lane shows fully linearized DNA.\nUse a Qiagen PCR purification kit to purify linearized DNA according to manufacturer’s instructions.\nUse a mMessage mMachine T3 transcription kit to produce cRNA following the manufacturer’s instructions, with 1 μg of linearized DNA used as the template.\nCritical: After cRNA synthesis, make sure to digest the DNA template using the Turbo DNase provided with the T3 transcription kit.\nPurify the cRNA using the Qiagen RNeasy MinElute kit according to the manufacturer’s protocols. and elute with 20–30 μL of RNase free water. The final yield should be 1–2 μg/μL.\nCheck the quality of RNA by standard RNA gel electrophoresis under denaturation conditions (Rio, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nCritical: If the result of RNA electrophoresis shows a smear or multiple bands, redo the cRNA prep and be careful applying RNA handling techniques to avoid RNase contamination (Nilsen, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nIf no smearing is observed, make 2 μg RNA aliquots and store in −80°C freezer.\nElectrical recordings using Xenopus oocytes—Defollicuating oocytes and injecting cRNA\nTiming: 10 h totally over 4–6 days\nThe steps below describe the procedure to prepare Xenopus oocytes and to inject cRNA into these cells to induce uniporter expression for subsequent electrical recordings.\nXenopus laevis ovary lobes can be purchased directly from Xenopus1. Alternatively, frogs can be housed in the institutional vivarium with ovary lobes obtained via laparotomy.\nRinse the ovary lobes three times with ND96. Fill a 50 mL conical tube with 20 mL of DB. Use scissors to cut the ovaries into lentil sized chunks into the tube, till the oocytes fill a volume of 5–10 mL.\nRinse oocytes with DB multiple times until the buffer runs clear.",
    "Dissolve 12.5 mg of type II collagenase in 10 mL of DB. Use all this solution to digest oocytes at 25°C for 30 min. Discard the solution and rinse oocytes multiple times with fresh DB until the buffer runs clear.\nRepeat step 30, 2–3 more times, until the follicle layer is fully digested (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1198-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Images of oocytes\n(A) Fully digested (left) vs incompletely digested oocytes (right).\n(B) Unhealthy oocyte (left) vs healthy oocyte (right). Healthy oocytes are round, smooth, and have a clearly defined light hemisphere and dark hemisphere. The appearance of lighter spots (top arrow) or white colored lesions (bottom arrow) on the dark hemisphere suggests deteriorating health.\n(C) Healthy oocyte (bottom) vs dying oocytes (top left and right). Dying oocytes lose the clear definition between the light and dark hemisphere (red arrow) and may begin to leak (blue arrow).\nCritical: Check under a stereoscope to make sure that the follicle layer is mostly gone.\nRinse with DB till the solution is clear. Wash the oocytes 3–4 times with 20 mL of ND96. Transfer digested oocytes to multiple 10-cm tissue-culture dishes containing ND96 with <100 oocytes/dish. Store the dishes at 17°C for 12–24 h before cRNA injection.\nCritical: Ensure that oocytes are completely submerged in ND96. Maintaining a low oocyte density (<100 oocyte/dish) in 10-cm dishes is  to keep oocytes healthy.\nNext day, select healthy stage V-VI oocytes, whose diameter should be ∼1 mm. Transfer them to new dishes with ND96.\nInject these oocytes with 30–60 ng of cRNA using a microinjector. 30–40 ng of cRNA is suitable for two-electrode voltage clamp, while 50–60 ng of cRNA is often necessary for patch clamp.\nTransfer injected oocytes into 6-well plates (5 oocytes/well) filled with ND96. Change the buffer every day and remove dead oocytes.",
    "Critical: It is important to remove dead oocytes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) and remove buffers containing oocyte debris. In our hands, the presence of dead oocytes and the substances these cells release seem to make other oocytes sick.\nThe oocytes will be ready for two-electrode voltage clamp or patch-clamp 3–5 days after cRNA injection."
