    "Cultivation under light, aerobic (a) and incubation under dark, anaerobic conditions (b)The glucose-tolerant strain (designated as GT) of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, isolated by Williams (1988), is cultivated in modified BG-11 medium (see Recipes), consisting of BG-110 liquid medium (Rippka, 1988) supplemented with 5 mM NH4Cl (buffered with 20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8). In our study, the GT-I strain was used (Kanesaki et al., 2012). The GT cells are cultivated in liquid modified BG-11 medium under air containing 1% (v/v) CO2, using a gas mixer (RK120XM, KOFLOC) and an air pump (LP-30A, Yasunaga) at the flow rate of 30-50 ml/min, in a cultivation chamber (CLE-303, TOMY). The temperature is kept at 30 °C and white light is supplied continuously at 50-70 µmol photons·m-2 sec-1. Cell densities are measured at A730 using the Shimadzu UV-2700 spectrophotometer. Cells cultivated in 70 ml of modified BG-11 medium (started from A730 = 0.4) for 3 days under, light, aerobic condition. The light, aerobic cultivation affects the levels of succinate and lactate, and optimization of culture conditions is required for each laboratory.The cell are collected by centrifugation at 5,600 x g for 2 min and concentrated into 10 ml of HEPES buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8) or modified BG-11 to reach an A730 of 20 in a vial (Figure 1). The vial is sealed with open-top-style aluminum caps with butyl rubber septa, and two needles (Needle 22 G x 1″ and Needle 22 G x 1 ½″) are stabbed through a septum. The 22 G x 1 ½″ needle is connected to a N2 gas generator to introduce an N2 gas for 30-60 min in order to generate the anaerobic condition. After introduction of the N2 gas, the needles are removed and the vial is wrapped with aluminum foil.",
    "The cells are incubated at 30 °C with shaking on a rotary shaker at 160 rpm for 1-5 days. For 1 day, succinate and lactate were less excreted from the cells. Succinate and lactate levels increased during long incubation, however, the levels reached maximum at 3 or 4 days, and started to decrease at 5 days (Osanai et al., 2015).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170426/20170426192829_7973.jpgFigure 1. A 20 ml vial for anaerobic incubation. Cells were concentrated into 10 ml of buffer or medium to reach an A730 of 20, and the vial was then sealed with a butyl rubber cap. Two syringes were inserted into the cap, and N2 gas was introduced through one of two syringes for 30-60 min. After introduction of the N2 gas, the syringes were removed and the vial was wrapped in aluminum foil to maintain a dark condition.Sample preparation for HPLC analysisAfter incubation, the aluminum cap with butyl rubber is removed with an opener. The cell cultures are centrifuged at 5,600 x g for 2 min. Using a SupraPure sterile syringe filter, the supernatants are filtered to remove debris.Then, 1 ml of supernatant is transferred into a 2 ml plastic tube. The supernatants are placed in a flask and dried at -80 °C with an FDU-2200 freeze dryer for 1 day. The freeze-dried samples are resolved with 100 µl of 3 mM perchloric acid (HClO4) (since HClO4 is highly corrosive, it should be handled with care) and centrifuged at 5,600 x g for 2 min. Then, transfer 100 µl of the supernatant into a Target DP vial using a glass insert. Set it in the autosampler for HPLC analysis. In case of samples containing large amount of proteins, freeze-dried samples should be resolved in 97 µl of 3 mM HClO4 and 3 µl of 100% trichloroacetic acid.",
    "Mix thoroughly and then centrifuge the samples at 20,400 x g for 10 min. Use the supernatant for HPLC analysis.To prepare standards, mix 100 μl of 500 mM succinate solution, 160 μl of 500 mM lactate solution, 100 μl of 500 mM citrate solution, 200 μl of 1 M acetate solution (see Recipes), and 440 μl of dH2O to make up a total 1 ml of organic acids standard. This solution was named STD1. The final concentration of each organic acid in STD1 is 80 mM lactate, 50 mM succinate, 50 mM citrate, and 200 mM acetate.Dilute STD1 to make a range of concentrations for drawing the analytical curves.HPLC analysisQuantification of the organic acids is performed by HPLC using post-labeling with BTB (Figure 2). Use 3 mM HClO4 solution as the mobile phase and 0.2 mM BTB in 15 mM Na2HPO4 solution as the reaction solution. The mobile phase and reaction solution are degassed for approximately 20 min using the ultrasonic cleaning machine and the aspirator. HPLC measurement is performed with the following conditions:Intelligent HPLC pump (Mobile phase): the flow rate is set at 0.7 ml/min. The pump is connected to the line degasser and the ternary gradient unit, and further connected to the intelligent column oven. Before sample injection, equilibrate the columns with mobile phase at same flow rate for one hour.Intelligent HPLC pump (Reaction solution): the flow rate is set at 1.2 ml/min.Intelligent column oven: the column temperature is 60 °C.Intelligent autosampler: the sampler temperature is 4 °C and the injection volume is 20 µl. To clean up the injection needle, use HClO4 solution. Flush three times with HClO4 before sample injection.Reaction coil unit was used for mixing mobile phase including samples and BTB solution.",
    "PDA: single beam photometer with deuterium (D2) and halogen (W) lamps; single data analysis is performed for 42 min using scans in the wavelength range of 200-900 nm. Before starting the HPLC analysis, wait for approximately 60 min until the flow is stable (baseline without drift and noise).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170426/20170426193410_3908.jpgFigure 2. Schematic diagram of HPLC analysis with bromothymol blue post-labeling. Two HPLC pumps are used for mobile phase and BTB solution, respectively. Samples are injected with autosampler and divided by size exclusion columns, followed by mixed with BTB solution. Organic acids are detected by PDA detector and analyzed by ChromNAV software."
