    "This protocol describes a method of generating murine PCLS. It can be used to generate PCLS from other species as well with some modifications.\nMaterials\nPhosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 806552)\nSuperglue\nComplete DMEM medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.505#cpz1505-rec-0002]), 4°C\nAdult C57BL/6 mice\nPentobarbital (Centaur)\nVibrating microtome, including metallic clamp and buffer tank (Compresstome® VF-310-0Z, Precisionary Instruments)\nBlades (World Precision Instruments, cat. no. 7550-1-SS)\nBlade holder\n24-well plates\n50-ml tubes\n1-ml syringes with 25G needles\nDissection instruments\nCannulas (19G needle with tubing; Intramedic™ Clay Adams Polyethylene Tubing 0.86 × 1.270 mm) connected to 2.5-ml syringes\nSewing thread\nPetri dishes\nDisposable scalpels (Swann-Morton)\nSpecimen tubes (Precisionary Instruments, cat. no. SKU VF-SPSK-VM-15.5-BOS)\nForceps\nThin spatula\nAdditional reagents and equipment for preparing warm (40°C) 1.5% low-melting-point agarose (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.505#cpz1505-rec-0005])\nSlicing preparation\n1. Cool PBS to 4°C.\n2. Prepare warm (40°C) 1.5% low-melting-point agarose.\n3. Pre-cool metallic clamp (from vibrating microtome) at −20°C for ≥20 min prior to slicing. Glue a blade to blade holder using superglue and leave it to set.\n4. Pipet 1 ml cold complete DMEM medium into each well of a 24-well plate and store at 4°C until slicing.\n5. Add 35 ml cold complete DMEM medium to a 50-ml tube and store at 4°C to store lungs after dissection.\nLung dissection\n6. Humanely kill adult C57BL/6 mice with a fatal dose of pentobarbital injected intraperitonially using a 1-ml syringe with a 25G needle.\n7. Remove chest wall using dissection instruments and insert a cannula into the trachea, fixing it using sewing thread.\n8. To inflate the adult mouse lungs, slowly inject 1 ml warm (40°C) 1.5% low-melting-point agarose (see step 2) into trachea through the cannula connected to a 2.5-ml syringe.\n9. Place ice on top of lungs to allow the agarose to solidify.",
    "10. Once this is achieved, remove lungs in one piece from the chest cavity and keep on ice in cold complete DMEM medium (see step 5) until slicing.\nPrecision-cut lung slicing technique\n11. Keep 1.5% low-melting-point agarose heated at 40°C (see step 2) and place metallic clamp from step 3 on ice.\n12. Place inflated lungs from step 10 into a petri dish filled with cold complete DMEM medium and separate lobes to manageable sizes for the vibrating microtome using a disposable scalpel.\n13. Add a small drop of superglue onto end of the plunger of the specimen tube. Pick up a lung lobe using forceps, dab it on a piece of tissue to remove excess medium, and place it onto the superglue.\n14. Fill specimen tube with warm (40°C) 1.5% low-melting-point agarose (see step 11) until the lung piece is covered and slowly draw plunger into the specimen tube until the agarose is just at the top.\n15. Adjust blade holder.\n16. Place specimen tube into the slot within the buffer tank in the vibrating microtome securely, until the stopper reaches the base, and fill buffer tank with the cold PBS from step 1.\n17. Press forward button on the vibrating microtome until the step motor drive touches the plunger.\n18. Adjust advance, oscillation, and thickness to the desired settings using the control box.\n19. Start slicing. After discarding the first few smaller PCLS, carefully lift out lung slices using a thin spatula and place them into the 24-well plate filled with cold complete DMEM medium (see step 4). Once a plate is filled, incubate lung slices in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator.\n20. Continue until reaching end of the lung lobe.\n21. Repeat steps 12 through 20 for remaining lung lobes.",
    "Mice have five lung lobes. Typically, the left lung lobe and the right caudal lobe give the best quality of PCLS. From an adult mouse, around 40 to 50 PCLS can be obtained, depending on how successful the inflation was.",
    "The following protocol covers the culturing of murine PCLS and a method to test the viability of the PCLS generated. PCLS generated from different species may require different culturing conditions.\nMaterials\nPCLS (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.505#cpz1505-prot-0001])\nComplete DMEM medium, 37°C\nAlamarBlue dye (Thermo Fisher, cat. no.

The next morning, to remove any excess agarose, add fresh warm complete DMEM medium to new 24-well plates and move PCLS to the new plate using a thin spatula.\n3. Change medium twice by carefully pipetting out the old medium and replacing it with fresh warm medium.\nAll washes are performed with 1 ml medium.\nViability assay\n4. Prepare a 10% solution of AlamarBlue dye in SF-DMEM and pre-warm in a 37°C water bath.\nPrepare enough dye for all PCLS to be tested.\n5.
