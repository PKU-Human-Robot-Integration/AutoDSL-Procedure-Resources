    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe first part of the protocol involves the selection of several unique peptides used in the design of the quantification concatamers (QconCATs) for absolute protein determination. QconCATs are implemented to precisely quantify the content of desired proteins not only in bacteria but also in any biological system by slightly adjusting the protein extraction procedure. The presented protocol includes all the necessary steps—from the in silico design to the calculation of the in vivo protein concentrations—to carry out an end-to-end workflow in Gram-negative bacteria (e.g., P. putida or E. coli).\nPeptide candidate mapping experiment\nTiming: 2–3 days\nGrow the pre-culture of the selected Gram-negative bacterial strain for ∼16 h at its optimal growth condition in a 50-mL Falcon tube containing 10 mL of 2×YT medium. Use colonies from a freshly-inoculated LB agar plate.\nNote: E. coli should be grown at 37°C and P. putida cultures are incubated at 30°C.\nRe-inoculate a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 50 mL of 2×YT medium by diluting the pre-culture 100× (500 μL).\nWhen the culture reaches mid-exponential phase (roughly equal to 0.5×OD600max, i.e., half the maximum optical density measured at 600 nm) or ∼0.4–0.5 mg of total cell dry weight.\nHarvest 1 mL of the suspension by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 10 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and freeze the cell pellets at –80°C until sample preparation.\nThaw the cell pellets on ice. Add two 3-mm zirconium oxide beads to each sample, and 100 μL of lysis buffer (6 M Gu·HCl [guanidinium hydrochloride], 5 mM TCEP [tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine], 10 mM CAA [2-chloroacetamide] and 100 mM Tris·HCl, pH = 8.5) to the samples.",
    "Disrupt the cell suspension in a Mixer Mill set at 25 Hz for 5 min at ∼20°C. Heat the sample for 10 min in a ThermoMixer at 99°C and 1,800 rpm.\nRemove the cell debris by centrifugation at 15,000 g for 10 min at 23°C and collect 50 μL of supernatant into a new Eppendorf tube. Dilute the cell extract with 50 μL of 50 mM (NH4)HCO3 (ammonium bicarbonate).\nQuantify protein concentration via the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17] and take 20 μg of protein for tryptic digestion into a new Eppendorf tube.\nDilute the tryptic digestion to reach a total volume of 100 μL by using the appropriate amount of 50 mM (NH4)HCO3 solution.\nNote: The expected protein concentration might vary according to the organism under study, carbon source and culture conditions. For a typical bacterial culture at OD600 = 1.0, the estimated protein concentration is ∼2 μg/μL.\nAdd 20 μL of 0.1 μg/μL trypsin and LysC digestion mix (ratio 1:1). Initiate the tryptic digestion at constant shaking (400 rpm) for 8 h and 37°C.\nNote: Ensure at least a 4× dilution to avoid interferences between the Gu·HCl present in the lysis buffer and the digestion enzymes.\nAdd 10 μL of 10% (w/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to stop the tryptic digestion. Vortex and centrifuge the samples at 15,000 g for 15 min at 23°C (See problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] in troubleshooting).\nPerform StageTipping, using C18 resin (solid phase extraction disk) to desalt the samples prior to HPLC-MS analysis. For a detailed explanation on StegeTipping desalting process, please refer to Rappsilber et al.18[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18] for further details.",
    "HPLC-MS analysis of the samples is performed using a Dionex UltiMate 3000 coupled to an Orbitrap Exploris 480 operated using data-dependent acquisition. The data analysis of the .RAW files is executed using Proteome Discoverer. Further details on HPLC-MS and data analysis can be found in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section; please also refer to Wirth et al.19[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19] and Kozaeva et al.20[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20] for details.\nThe experimental workflow to build the peptide list is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2389-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Standard design of the inducible pQconCAT plasmid to produce labeled peptides for absolute protein quantification\n(A and B) The plasmid encompasses different parts that allow the production of the desired protein: (A) concatenated peptides (n peptides) selected in “peptide candidate mapping experiment[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1]” and (B) a T7 RNA polymerase promoter region, ribosome binding site (RBS), quantification tag (e.g., [Glu1]-fibrinopeptide B), sacrificial peptide, hexahistidine purification tag (HisTag×6), stop codon, antibiotic resistance determinant and origin of vegetative replication (oriV). This design allows for the production of an equimolar (1:1) amount of QconCAT peptides, which can be added in known quantities to the sample. Then, the amount of each represented peptide standard can be calculated based on the [Glu1]-fibrinopeptide B, serving as a reference to accurately quantify proteins.\nNote: Only consider unique peptides for quantification. Assign the detected peptides to their functions using a protein database consisting of the reference Gram-negative bacteria proteome. If necessary, supplement heterologously expressed proteins by adding those proteins and sequences to the FASTA file obtained from the database.\nFrom the peptide candidate list obtained, select the peptides using the following criteria:\nMass peptide: select peptides ranging 350–5,000 Da in mass.",
    "Avoid proline (P) residues on the carboxyl side of the cleavage site (RP or KP) as well as acidic residues—aspartate (D) and glutamate (E)—on either side of the cleavage site due to the lower rate of hydrolysis.\nPick two or more proteotyptic peptides per protein with the highest fragment intensity. Please refer to Calderón-Celis et al.21[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21] for details.\nIn silico QconCAT plasmid design (pQconCAT)\nTiming: 15–20 days\nIn silico design of pQconCAT vectors.\nThe plasmid design should contain the following structure:\nT7 RNA polymerase promoter region;\nRibosome binding site;\nQuantification tag (e.g., [Glu1]-fibrinopeptide B);\nSacrificial peptide;\nConcatenated peptides (n peptides) selected in “peptide candidate mapping experiment[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1]”;\nHexahistidine purification tag (HisTag×6);\nSTOP codon;\nAntibiotic resistance determinant;\nOrigin of vegetative replication (oriV). The general structure of plasmid pQconCAT is depicted in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nNote: Optimize (optional) the QconCAT gene for codon usage in E. coli to facilitate production of the concatamers.\nOrder the plasmid previously designed (typical synthesis time: 15 days).\nQconCAT transformation and expression\nTiming: 7–10 days\nCompetent cells for pQconCAT transformation.\nGrow for ∼16 h a pre-culture of E. coli BL21(DE3) ΔlysA ΔargH in 5 mL of LB medium at 37°C in a shaker at 250 rpm.\nInoculate 50 mL of fresh LB medium, placed in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask, with 0.5 mL of the pre-culture to yield an OD600 ∼0.05.\nGrow cells at 37°C in a shaker at 250 rpm until the culture reaches OD600 ∼0.5 (∼2–3 h).\nPlace the Erlenmeyer flask to ice to prevent further bacterial growth.\nNote: From now on, steps e-k should be performed at 4°C, maintaining cells on an ice bath and using chilled tubes.\nTransfer the cells to a pre-chilled 50-mL Falcon conical tube.\nHarvest the cells in a pre-cooled centrifuge at 4°C for 10 min and 4,500 g. Discard the supernatant.",
    "Resuspend the pellet in 1-mL chilled, filter-sterile 10% (v/v) glycerol solution and transfer to a chilled 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube.\nCentrifuge for 1 min at 11,000 g and 4°C. Discard supernatant.\nRepeat steps g and h at least twice.\nNote: The pellet will become softer with every wash round. Be careful when removing the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 10% (v/v) glycerol to 1:100 volume of initial culture (i.e., 500 μL). Culture volumes can be scaled down accordingly if only a few transformations will be performed.\nTransfer 30–50 μL aliquots to chilled 1.5-mL Eppendorf tubes.\nNote: Cells can be flash-frozen and maintained at –80°C until transformation or used directly for electroporation.\npQconCAT transformation.\nTake competent cells E. coli BL21(DE3) ΔlysA ΔargH from –80°C and place them on ice.\nPrepare the plasmid suspension by diluting it in the tube to a concentration of 100 ng/μL using MQ water.\nAdd ∼25–50 ng of the plasmid into the cell tubes and vortex quickly one time.\nPut the cells and the plasmid on ice for 30 min.\nPlace the tube into the water bath at 42°C for 60 s. After that, place them back on ice for 2 min.\nAdd 1 mL of LB medium (without antibiotics), transfer the cells into a 2-mL Eppendorf tube and incubate the bacterial suspension for 1 h at 37°C in a Thermal Mixer with a 24 × 2 mL microtube block Eppendorf shaker at 800 rpm.\nPlate 50 μL of the cell suspension on LB agar plates (with the corresponding antibiotic) using pre-sterilized 2-mm glass beads.\nNote: The antibiotic to be added to the plates depends on the selection marker in the plasmid used for the protein expression. Prepare a 1,000× antibiotic stock solution and dilute to 1×.",
    "Centrifuge the tube containing the remaining cells at 10,000 g for 5 min and discard most of the medium (∼900 μL). Resuspend the cells in the remainder liquid.\nPlate the cell suspension on LB agar plates (with the corresponding antibiotic) using 2-mm glass beads and incubate the plates for ∼16 h in an incubator at 37°C.\nPick the colonies, confirm presence of the plasmid by mini-prep and sequencing, and prepare glycerol stocks of the selected clones.\nQconCAT expression.\nInoculate pre-cultures in 50-mL Falcon tubes containing 10 mL of M9 minimal medium with 40 mM glucose, 0.1 mg/mL U13C-L-lysine, 0.1 mg/mL U13C-L-arginine + the selected antibiotic (1× final concentration, see above) at 37°C at 200 rpm for ∼16 h (see problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] in troubleshooting).\nDilute the pre-culture 1:100 in 100 mL of the same medium described in 3.a. placed in 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask, and incubate the culture at 37°C.\nWhen the culture reaches OD600 ∼ 0.5–0.6, cool down the flask (in ice or cold room) until it reaches approximately ∼23°C.\nInduce the expression of the construct borne by plasmid pQconCAT by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM and incubate for 24 h at 30°C and 200 rpm (see problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3] in troubleshooting).\nNote: The concatamer polypeptide tends to form inclusion bodies (IBs) when using this IPTG concentration to induce the expression of the construct. It is possible to optimize the IPTG concentration for different polypeptides if needed. In case that no information is available, a low IPTG concentration (e.g., 0.2 mM) is a good starting point. Please refer to Lozano Terol et al.22[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22] for further information.\nCentrifuge the culture at 3,000 g and 4°C for 20 min in a 250-mL Nalgene™ plastic bottle.\nFreeze the bacterial pellets at –20°C for 1 h to weaken the cell membrane.",
    "Pause point: It is possible to store the pellets at –20°C gor ∼16 h and continue with the rest of the procedure the next day.\nCell disruption, inclusion bodies solubilization and pQconCAT purification.\nCell disruption:\nThaw the frozen pellets and resuspend the biomass in 25 mL of resuspension buffer by vortexing. Pour the suspended pellet solution in a 50-mL Falcon tube.\nSonicate the samples using a Vibra-Cell sonicator at 65% intensity for 10 min with ON-OFF cycles of 30 s.\nNote: The samples should be maintained at 4°C during the sonication.\nIncubate the lysate with 2 μL of Pierce™ Universal Nuclease for Cell Lysis for at least 30 min at 23°C to digest DNA and reduce the viscosity of the sample.\nCentrifuge lysates for 20 min at 16,000 g in a cooled centrifuge (4°C).\nCritical: At this point, the soluble proteins should be present in the supernatant. However, because of the nature of the polypeptide, the QconCAT will be typically recovered from IBs. These IBs will be present in the pellet (insoluble fraction) of the sample, with a negligible amount of QconCATs in the supernatant.\nRecover the pellet and use it in the next step for IB solubilization.\nNote: The supernatant should be stored at 4°C in case that no protein is detected in the IB fraction (pellet); if this is the case, filter the supernatant using a 0.45 μm and then a 0.22 μm membrane. Continue to step 5.a. if the protein of interest is in the soluble fraction.\nPause point: The pellet can be stored at –20°C in case you need to pause the process.\nCritical: The solubilization buffers A and B must be prepared immediately before this step.\nIBs solubilization:",
    "Resuspend the pellet in 2 mL of buffer A by pipetting up and down until the protein pellet is completely dissolved. Place the dissolved protein in a new 2-mL Eppendorf tube.\nCentrifuge for 60 min at 4°C and 15,000 g. Remove the supernatant and proceed with pellet solubilization.\nSolubilize the protein by adding 5–10 mL of buffer B.\nNote: Do not add the whole volume of buffer B directly to the pellet; rather add 1-mL aliquots at a time to gradually dissolve the materials. Repeat this procedure until dissolving the whole insoluble fraction. Do not use more than 10 mL of the solubilization solution. Place the solution in a 15-mL Falcon tube.\nStir gently for 1 h at 4°C in a waving shaker with an inclination of 30°C.\nNote: In case the pellet is not completely dissolved, it is recommended to leave the sample for ∼16 h at the conditions mentioned above to complete the solubilization of the polypeptide.\nCentrifuge for 15 min at 4°C and 15,000 g to eliminate insoluble debris. Store the supernatant containing the solubilized protein. Continue to the purification step.\nQconCAT purification:\nAssemble the purification Pierce™ Disposable Column by placing a filter disc in the bottom, cap the column tip and add 2 mL of HisPur™ Ni-NTA resin.\nNote: Mix the resin vigorously to form a homogenous solution before adding it to the column.\nAllow the resin to drain without becoming completely dry by removing the cap. Once the resin is drained, recap the column.\nNote: To drain buffers/solution, remove the cap and recap once the column is drained. Place several 50-mL Falcon tubes under the column during the different intermediate steps in order to collect the fractions.",
    "To wash and equilibrate the column, add 2 mL of equilibration buffer (no need to be gentle with the resin) and let the resin drain. Place the cap on the tip.\nLoad the solution containing the QconCATs on top of the resin. Collect the flow-through and repeat this step twice to increase protein recovery.\nNote: It is important to keep the fraction containing the QconCATs at 4°C.\nWash the resin twice with 10 mL of equilibration buffer Ni-resin.\nElute twice with 2 mL of elution buffer.\nLoad the eluent in a 50-mL Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters (with a cut-off of at least 10 kDa below the size of the polypeptide of interest) and proceed to exchange the buffer.\nCentrifuge at 4,000–7,000 g for 10 min at 4°C and refill the column with 4 mL of sample exchange buffer (see problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7] in troubleshooting).\nRepeat the step above 3–4 times to properly exchange the buffer. Then, recover the purified proteins in a final volume of 1 mL of the buffer by pipetting up and down. Centrifuge the sample again in case that more than 1 mL is obtained.\nMeasure the protein concentration by using NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer. Absorbance ratio at 260 nm over 280 nm (A260/A280) should be around 0.6. The schematic representation of pQconCAT transformation, pQconCAT expression, cell disruption, and inclusion bodies solubilization is presented in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]. The QconCAT purification workflow is illustrated in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nSDS-PAGE of purified proteins.\nPrepare your protein samples in a 0.2-mL PCR tube by mixing the components listed in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]:\nNote: Load ∼0.2–1 μg of the purified protein in the polyacrylamide gel to get clear bands. Bigger protein amounts can lead to streaked bands, while lower a mass below 0.2 μg can result in the absence of noticeable bands in the gel.",
    "Critical: 4× 2-Mercaptoethanol is a 600 mM solution (in water); work in the chemical fume hood when preparing and handling this solution.\nIncubate the samples at 95°C for 5 min and spin them down in a spin microcentrifuge.\nTake a Mini-PROTEAN TGX 4%–20% resolving gel and remove the comb carefully to avoid damaging the wells. Remove the green tape at the bottom of the gel and insert it in a Mini-PROTEAN tetra cell vertical gel electrophoresis system.\nPlace the cell in the suitable position of the tank buffer. Use the 1× SDS-PAGE buffer to fill the cell volume completely and the rest of the buffer tank up to the appropriate level mark.\nLoad 10 μL of the suspension sample. Include at least one well with 2–3 μL of Page Ruler Plus Prestained Protein Ladder, 10–250 kDa.\nRun the SDS-PAGE at 200 V for approximately 25 min.\nNote: Recycle the buffer outside the electrophoresis cell as long as the dye inside the precast cell has not escaped through the bottom of the gel.\nOpen the precast gel using a spatula or gel knife, wash it with distilled water and incubate it in ∼15–20 mL of Instant Blue staining (enough volume to cover the gel) with gently shaking at 23°C. Bands will be visible after 15 min and completely stained after 1 h.\nWash the gel to remove the dye by washing it with 30 mL of distilled water for 5 min.

    "Note: The endogenous protein quantity can be estimated from previous studies.23[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23] Usually, 200 fmol/μg total protein is a reasonable start point; this means that if 20 μg of protein are taken for the digestion, 4,000 fmol will be present in the sample.

The concentration of the endogenous peptide will have the same unit as the concentration of the QconCAT peptide, e.g., fmol/μg total protein. The concentration of the endogenous protein is either the same as the molar concentration of the corresponding endogenous peptide (due to equimolar concentrations of peptide and protein), or an average of the endogenous peptide concentrations when multiple peptides per endogenous protein where present in the QconCAT protein standard.\nPlease refer to the following repository https://github.com/biosustain/QconCATquantSTAR[href=https://github.com/biosustain/QconCATquantSTAR] to calculate the peptide concentrations.
