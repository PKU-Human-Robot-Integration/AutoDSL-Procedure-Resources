    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe day before staining\nWe recommend performing experiments over two consecutive days, as the protocol is lengthy and could be exhausting. In the first day, samples, buffers, regents, and labels are prepared as follows.\nTiming: 2–3 h\nCollect sample vials in a separate box for quick retrieval on the day of staining. Keep samples in liquid nitrogen storage until ready to begin the protocol. Cells were cryopreserved as described by Bull et al. (2007)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4].\nPrepare tubes, labels, buffers, and antibody mixtures as described below.\nFill pre-labeled 15 mL tubes with 5 mL of pre-warmed thawing media – prepared as described below. This is for resuspending the thawed samples. The number of tubes depends on the number of samples to be stained (up to 40).\nPrepare antibody master mixes as described in step 2 below and store them at 4°C.\nPrepare the barcode table, where each sample will be assigned to one CD45- Pt (either 194Pt or 198Pt) and one palladium code from the Cell-IDTM 20-plex Pd barcoding kit, as shown in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1931_4.csv\nPreparing buffers and reagents.\nCyTOF staining media (CSM): sterile PBS supplemented with 2% FBS and 0.5% sodium azide. Store at 4°C.\nThawing media: RPMI containing 5% FBS. Incubate in 37°C water bath.\nPreparing antibody master mixes. ∗Prior to preparing staining master mixes, subtract the total volume of antibodies that will be added from the desired final volume of master mix to determine the amount of diluent (CSM or permeabilization buffer) to use.\nSurface stain – master mix 1: Prepare a 2× mix in CSM including all the pre-titrated, pre-conjugated extracellular antibodies in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1931_5.csv",
    "Prepare a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube with the volume of CSM necessary to achieve a 2× antibody concentration. Place the individual antibody vials and the Eppendorf on ice. Arrange the vials in the order of the antibody list.\nAdd the first antibody to the Eppendorf tube to reach the desired concentration. A final volume of 50 μL is sufficient for staining up to 10 × 106 PBMCs. For highly multiplexed samples, a master mix volume of 150 μL is recommended. Prepare 25 μL of extra master mix to account for any pipettor error. For example, to make a 2× anti-CD3 that has an optimal dilution of 1:50 in a final volume of 175 μL, add 7 μL of conjugated anti-CD3 antibody to 40.25 μL of CSM. Add the rest of the antibodies similarly. See Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\nOnce added, transfer the vial to another ice bucket and check it off of the antibody list. This helps keep track of the antibodies that have been added and prevents errors in repetition or omission.\nRepeat steps 2.1.2 and 2.1.3 until all surface antibodies have been added.\nStore master mix 1 at 4°C and vortex before use.\nIntracellular stain – master mix 2: Prepare a 1× mix in 1× permeabilization buffer according to the pre-determined optimal dilutions for each of the intracellular antibodies in Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1931_6.csv\nA final volume of 100 μL is sufficient for staining up to 10 × 106 PBMCs. For highly multiplexed samples, a master mix volume of 300 μL is recommended. Prepare 25 μL of extra master mix to account for any pipettor error.\nPrepare a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube as in 2.1.1 with the volume of permeabilization buffer needed to achieve a 1× concentration.\nAdd antibodies as in 2.1.2–2.1.4.",
    "Store master mix 2 at 4°C and vortex before use.\nNote: A- The optimal dilutions of all the metal-tagged antibodies used in these protocol were determined through serial dilutions testing as described by van Vreden et al. (2019)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13].\nB- We highly recommend that the performance of the panel should be examined first on control samples prior to proceeding to valuable clinical samples.\nOn day of staining\nThe major steps on the second day are staining cells with viability marker, surface and intracellular markers to be able to identify cell types and protein expression.\nTiming: 6 h\nPrepare the following buffers. Store at 4°C and vortex before use.\n1× Maxpar perm barcode buffer: dilute 10× Maxpar barcode buffer using Maxpar PBS.\nFixation/permealization buffer: add fixation/permeabilization concentrate from eBioscience FOXP3/transcription factor staining buffer kit to the fixation/permeabilization diluent at dilution 1:3 (e.g., 100 μL of the fixation concentrate to 300 μL of the dilutent).\nFc blocker: add 50 μL of Fc receptor binding inhibitor to 450 μL CSM.\nViability buffer: add 8 μL Cell-ID™ intercalator – 103Rh to 4 mL of RPMI.\n1× Permeabilizaiton buffer: add 1 mL of 10× Permeabilization Buffer from eBioscience FOXP3/transcription Factor Staining Buffer Kit to 9 mL of ddH2O.\nDNA staining buffer: prepare 1 mL of iridium-DNA intercalation solution by adding 1 μLCell-ID™ intercalator-Ir (125 μM) to 1 mL of Maxpar fix and perm buffer.\nAntibody master mix filtration:\nAdd each antibody master mix into a separate 0.1 μm Millipore centrifuge tube.\nSpin the centrifuge tubes with a fixed-angle centrifuge rotor at 12,000 × g, 4°C for 2 min.\nDiscard the Millipore filter and store the tubes at 4°C.\nThawing cells:\nBring a bucket filled with dry ice and another bucket filled with regular ice to the 37°C water bath.",
    "Place sample vials on the dry ice and place the pre-labeled 15 mL tubes in the ice bucket.\nThaw samples one at a time by placing vial on a rack in the 37°C water bath for approximately 1 min.\nQuickly transfer the contents of the freshly thawed vial into the appropriate pre-labeled tube filled with 5 mL thawing media and leave it on ice.\nCentrifuge the sample tubes at 600 × g, 4°C for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nIf the samples cell count were not previously performed and recorded prior to cryopreservation, count each sample manually using a hemocytometer and record the viable cell counts.\nResuspend cell pellets in 100 μL thawing media again and transfer it to a 96-well V-bottom plate∗.\n∗Notes:\nA- Ideally, reserve up to 2 million cells from each sample for staining. Expect ∼30%–50% cell loss during the staining process. Note, we have stained as few as 10,000 cells from a single sample (Gadalla et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nB- Arrange samples in the plate so that there are 10 samples in each row, and each barcode set is separated from the other to avoid mixing up staining (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1931-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Sample and Maxpar barcoding kit vial layouts\n(A) Figure shows the layout of samples in a 96-well V-bottom plate.\n(B) Picture shows Maxpar barcoding kit minivial strips.\ni. Centrifuge the plate at 600 × g, 4°C for 3 min. Discard supernatant.\nViability stain and live-cell barcoding:\nFor 40 samples experiment, split the 4 mL of 103Rh viability buffer in two 2 mL Eppendorf tubes.\nAdd 40 μL of CD45-194Pt to one of the 103Rh-viability buffer tubes (dilution 1:50), and 40 μL of CD45-198Pt to the other 103Rh-viability buffer tube. These antibodies were pretitrated for optimal performance.",
    "Note: Other metal-tags for CD45 antibodies could be used. 194Pt and 198Pt here are just examples. This need to be tailored according to each panel and the available channels.\nUsing multichannel pipette, add 100 μL of the CD45-194Pt-103Rh-RPMI mix to the first 20 wells of the 96-well V-bottom plate containing your samples, and mix by gentle pipetting.\nAdd 100 μL of the CD45-198Pt-103Rh-RPMI mix to the remaining 20 wells of the 96-well V-bottom plate containing the rest of your samples, and mix by gentle pipetting.\nPut the cover lid on the 96-well V-bottom.\nIncubate the plate for 15 min at 37°C.\nAdd 100 μL of PBS to each well.\nCentrifuge at 600 × g, 4°C for 3 min.\nFlick the plate to discard the supernatant.\nBlot the plate gently on paper towel to get rid of any residual supernatant.\nFixation and permeabilization:\nAdd 5 mL of the previously prepared fixation/permeabilization buffer to a multichannel pipette solution basin.\nUsing a multichannel pipette, add 100 μL of fixation/permeabilization buffer to each well and resuspend cells by gentle pipetting.\nIncubate for 15 min at room temperature.\nRemove 2 sets of barcode vials from the −20°C freezer (each set has 20 mini-vials labeled from 1 to 20 – each 10 barcodes are attached in one single strip).\nPlace the 4 mini-vial strips in rack as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and let them thaw at room temperature for the next step.\nAdd 100 μL of 1× Maxpar perm barcode buffer to each well of the plate containing the sample using multichannel pipette and solution basin.\nCentrifuge the plate at 900 × g, 4°C for 3 min.\nFlick the plate to discard the supernatant.\nBlot the plate gently on paper towel to get rid of any residual supernatant.\nBarcoding:",
    "Add 100 μL of 1× Maxpar barcode buffer to each barcode mini-vial, and mix well by gentle pipetting.\nTransfer 100 μL from each barcode vial to its respective sample well in the 96-well V-bottom plate according to the barcode map (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). Mix well by gentle pipetting.\nIncubate for 30 min at room temperature.\nAdd 100 μL of Maxpar CSM to each well.\nCentrifuge at 900 × g, 4°C for 3 min.\nFlick the plate to discard the supernatant.\nBlot the plate gently on paper towel to get rid of any residual supernatant.\nAdd 200 μL of Maxpar CSM to each well. Repeat steps 7.5 and 7.6. ∗Washing the cells twice ensures that no leftover barcodes remain in any wells, and prevents mixing of barcodes when the samples are pooled in the next step.\nAdd 100 μL Maxpar CSM to each well.\nPool samples by transferring the content of each well to a 4 mL polystyrene conical “FACS” tube.\nCentrifuge at 900 × g, 4°C for 5 min.\nAspirate and discard the supernatant.\nCell staining:\nFc blocking step:\nFor up to 80 × 106 cells, resuspend cells in 150 μL of Fc blocker and mix by gentle pippetting.\nIncubate for 10 min at room temperature.\nSurface staining:\nAdd 150 μL of 2× surface stain (master mix 1) directly to the sample (suspended in same volume of Fc blocking buffer) to make final 1× concentration of antibodies cocktail. Mix by gentle pipetting.\nIncubate for 30 min at 4°C.\nAdd 2 mL of CSM to each well, and mix by gentle pipetting.\nCentrifuge at 900 × g, 4°C for 5 min.\nAdd 2 mL 1× permeabilization buffer and resuspend cell pellet by gentle pipetting.\nCentrifuge at 900 × g, 4°C for 5 min.\nAspirate and discard the supernatant.\nIntracellular staining:",
    "Add 300 μL of 1× intracellular stain (master mix 2); mix by pipetting up and down 3 times and incubate for 30 min at 4°C.\nAdd 2 mL of PBS.\nCentrifuge at 900 × g, 4°C for 5 min.\nAspirate and discard the supernatant.\nIridium labeling of cellular DNA:\nSuspend cell pellet in 300 μL of DNA staining buffer.\nIncubate for 30 min 4°C.\nAdd 2 mL PBS.\nCentrifuge at 900 × g, 4°C for 5 min.\nAspirate and discard the supernatant.\nStoring stained cells:\nSamples can be stored in 200 μL of 1.6% FA/PBS for up to 1 week at 4°C.\nNote: ∗For long-term storage, cryopreservation in 10% DMSO 90% FBS has been shown to be effective in preserving the signal quality for up to 4 weeks (Sumatoh et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nPreparing stained cells for acquisition.\nOn the day of acquisition, add 2 mL of PBS to the stained and barcoded cells.\nCentrifuge at 900 × g, 4°C for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1 mL PBS.\nCount cells manually using a hemocytometer and record the cell count.\nNote: Obtaining the total cell count is necessary for CyTOF acquisition, as the CyTOF operator uses it to determine the volume of the acquisition buffer mixed with normalization beads to add to the sample (Lee and Rahman, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nFilter the cells using the 5 mL Round Bottom Polystyrene Test Tube, with Cell Strainer Snap Cap.\nCentrifuge at 900 × g, 4°C for 5 min.\nDiscard supernatant and keep the tube containing the cell pellet on ice.\nNote: More than 40 samples can be barcoded and stained by using more than two CD45 antibodies e.g., 60 samples can be barcoded by using 3 separate CD45 antibodies (Thrash et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12])."
