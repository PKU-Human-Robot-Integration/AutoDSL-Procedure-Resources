    "Remove growth media from adherent or suspended cells and then wash twice with PBS 1×. Balance to 37°C before use. The 1× Buffer can be kept frozen or at 4°C for future use.The medium should not contain phenol red or other colorimetric dyes, before and during the assay. The CM-DCFH2-DA should only be dissolved in anhydrous DMSO, DMF, or ethanol (100%). The working solutions must be freshly prepared in a light-protected vial, and tightly closed until use.For a standard assay used often, dissolve 50 mg of CM-DCFH2-DA (MW 487.3) in 2.565 ml of DMSO or absolute ethanol (40 mM). Aliquots can be kept at -20°C for at least 3 months. Dilute 100 µl of the stock solution with 39.9 ml of pre-warmed culture medium (final working concentration 100 μM), vortex, and add to the cell culture wells.CM-DCFH2-DA should be utilized in concentrations as low as possible to decrease potential artifacts, such as incomplete hydrolysis, and contamination by hydrolytic by-products. The ideal working solution for each application must be determined empirically, to obtain a good signal-to-noise ratio, e.g., by 2-3 further 2-fold dilutions of the standard concentration.Incubate the cells in the Ultra-Low Cluster Plate (specific black coated 96-well dish) in the cell incubator (37°C), with high relative humidity (95%), and a controlled level of carbon dioxide (5%) in the dark. Usually, a loading time of 2 h is sufficient. Additionally, if multi-well plates and an automated plate reader are used, it is crucial to estimate the total amount of cells, cell density, and/or total protein level for each individual well, to allow normalization and secure optimal cell density and viability.Wash carefully with the cell buffer, followed by incubation, allowing a brief recovery period for cellular esterases to hydrolyze the acetate groups. Let the dye respond to oxidation.",
    "A suggested positive buffer control is H2O2, or tert-Butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) at a final concentration of 50 μM.The redox state of the sample can be measured via the increasing fluorescence of DCF in cells, as measured at 530 nm when the sample is excited at 485 nm.Importantly, the fluorescence of negative controls without DCFH2-DA maintained in loading buffer needs to be determined as background.In most healthy cells, oxygen radicals are eliminated by cellular enzymes and/or natural antioxidants, resulting in a usually low level of fluorescence.Power up the fluorescence plate reader at a suitable interval prior to the initiation of the time course measurements. Describe the plate dimension situations and choose the appropriate filter set for excitation/detection of fluorescence.Read the fluorescence on each plate and print the plate data or save in digital form.Average the interpretations from the triplicates for each experimental condition and calculate the percent coefficient of variation (CV) for each of the means.Subtract the fluorescence average of the cell-free treatment control from that of the condition treated under the equivalent experimental conditions to determine the intracellular DCF fluorescence. Calculate the mean fluorescence and CV for each triplicate, confirming that the triplicates are consistent."
