    "Medicago seed sterilization   Place seeds in 15 ml plastic falcon tube. Add 3 ml of sulfuric acid to expose the seed for 5-8 min with occasional mixing in a fume hood with personal protective equipment.    Rapidly remove the acid with pipet, and wash 4 times with sterilized double-distilled water.   Soak the seeds in 10% sodium hypochlorite for 90 sec.    Rinse 8 times with sterile water.   Place the seeds in a petri dish on a sterile paper filer wetted with 2 ml sterile water.   Place seeds in the refrigerator at 4 °C (in the dark) for 3-5 days.    Move seeds to room temperature (in the dark) and let sit for 1 day to pre-germinate.      Sinorhizobium strains   Sinorhizobium meliloti strains are grown in TY medium for 2 days, with shaking.   The cultures are centrifuged at 8,000 x g for 10 min and washed twice with sterile 0.85% sodium chloride.   The resultant cultures are diluted to107 cells/ml with sterile 0.85% sodium chloride.   Prepare inoculant mixture using the diluted 107 cells/ml culture. The proportion of two strains can vary from 1:1,000 to 1,000:1.      Co-inoculation and plant growth condition   Prepare sterile Leonard jar assemblies containing mixture of Sunshine mix #5 and Turface MVP at 1:1 ratio. Nitrogen-free plant nutrient solution was prepared for watering.   Plant three germinated seeds in 1 cm deep hole and lightly cover the seeds with soil in each Leonard jar.    Inoculate each seed with 1 ml of inoculant mixtures using a pipette, where the proportion of two strains varied from 1:1,000 to 1,000:1. We suggest using 5 different proportional inoculant mixtures, uninoculated controls, and control plants inoculated with a single strain.    The jars are incubated in a plant growth chamber at 25 °C with a 16-h light condition and 21 °C for 8 h in the dark.",
    "Humidity should be between 50-70%. Light conditions should be 200-350 µmol/m/s.   After one week, cover soil with sterilized paraffin coated sands and remove extra plants by cutting with a sterile forceps. Each pot only contains 1 plant.      Recovery and identification of Sinorhizobium strains in nodules   After 28 days of cultivation, 10-15 nodules are randomly collected from each plant root, and placed into 1.5 ml centrifuge tube by cutting the root about 0.5 cm on each side of the nodule.   The surface of the nodules are sterilized by immersion in 95% ethanol for 10 sec and then in 2% (v/v) solution of sodium hypochlorite for 5 min.   The nodules are rinsed with sterile water, 5 times, and transferred into a 96-well microtiter plate containing 100 μl of sterile 0.85% NaCl.    The surface-sterilized nodule in each well is crushed by using a sterile toothpick.   The suspension is streaked on TY plates.   Three single colonies from each TY plate were transferred onto a TY plates containing antibiotic at specific concentrations that each strain is resistant to.   Strains in nodules are determined by the antibiotic resistance.      Quantitative evaluation of competitive nodulation   The competitive ability for nodulation is quantified by nodule occupancy rates in seven inoculant mixtures, with the proposition of two strains ranging from 1:1,000 to 1,000:1.    Nodule occupancy rate of strain A is calculated by dividing the number of nodules containing strain A (NA) by the total nodules (NA+ NB) tested.    A strain which has statistically greater nodule occupancy rate when two strains co-inoculated at a 1:1 ratio (determined by microscopic count) has greater competitive ability for nodulation over the other strain.",
    "The competitiveness is quantitatively evaluated by the linear relationship between the logarithm of ratio of the numbers of nodules formed by each of two strains (NA/NB) and the logarithm of ratio of the cell numbers of two strains (IA/IB): log (NA/NB) = logCAB + k•log (IA/IB) (Amarger and Lobreau, 1982).   The intercept of the regression line, the CAB value is an index representing the competitiveness of strain A in relation to that of strain B. CAB is close to 1 when two strains have equal competitiveness for nodulation. If CAB is greater than 1, stain A has greater nodulation competitiveness in relation to strain B. As an example, the nodulation competition between S. medicae WSM419 wild-type and its isogenic nolR mutant was presented in a paper by Sugawara and Sadowsky (2014)."
