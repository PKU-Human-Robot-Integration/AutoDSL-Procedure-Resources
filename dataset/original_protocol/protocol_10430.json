    "1. Preparation\nClean 100 ml round bottom flasks using aqua regia (1 part of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and 3 parts of concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl)) and wash the flasks with DI water. Autoclave the flasks and dry them in a hot air oven at 100 °C for 15 min. Wrap and store the sterile flasks until use.\nSterilize the hand-held mini-extruder set using 70% ethanol.\nTurn on the rotary evaporator and set the temperature of the hot water bath and the cooling tower at 37 °C and 4 °C respectively.\nPrepare 60 mM calcein stock solution by dissolving 374 mg of calcein in 10 ml of 0.1 mM phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4). Adjust the pH to 7.4 using 1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution.\n2. Synthesis of Liposomes\nRemove the lipids (1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (MPPC) and 1, 2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanol-amine-N-[carboxy(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (ammonium salt) (DSPE-PEG2000)) from freezer (-20 °C) and thaw them to RT.\nWeigh 15.9 mg DPPC, 1.3 mg MPPC, and 2.8 mg DSPE-PEG2000. Dissolve them together in 2 ml chloroform.\nTransfer the chloroform solution to the sterile round bottom flask and evaporate the solvent using the rotary evaporator under reduced pressure, to form a thin, dry lipid layer.\nHydrate the lipid layer at 45 °C with 2 ml aqueous solution for 30 min containing 1.95 ml 60 mM calcein prepared in step 1.4 and 50 µl Au NPs (3.36 × 1016 particles/ml).\nPre-heat the heating block to 45 °C. Place a 200 nm polycarbonate membrane filter between the filter supports and assemble the mini-extruder set. Check the potential leakage with DI water.\nFill one of the syringes with 1 ml of liposome solution from step 2.4 and extrude the sample by passing the solution to the syringe at the other end of the assemble mini-extruder. Repeat 11 times.",
    "Run the synthesized liposomes through a PD-10 desalting column to remove the free Au NPs, lipids and calcein using PBS as the eluent according to manufacturer's protocol.\nStore the samples in sterile tubes at 4 °C and use in 2 days.\n3. Calcein Release from Liposomes with Heating\nCalculate the lipid molarity of the stock solution by adding up the molarities of DPPC, MPPC, and DSPE-PEG2000 in step 2.2. Dilute the liposome stock solution to 5 mM lipid concentration using 0.1 mM PBS buffer (pH 7.4). Transfer the samples to a centrifuge tube (2 ml).\nPlace the tube in a hot water bath, and raise the temperature gradually from 25 to 70 °C. Increase the temperature at a rate of 1 °C/min here.\nCollect aliquots (10 µl) at different temperature points (27, 32, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 52, 57, 62, 67 and 70 °C).\nAdd 10 µl of 2% Triton X-100 to 2 ml aliquot of liposomal solution to digest the liposomes for 10 min at RT and to achieve complete release of calcein.\nTransfer 200 µl of the liposomal solution to each well in the 96-well microplate and measure the fluorescence intensity of the collected samples using a fluorescence microplate reader. The excitation and emission wavelengths of calcein are 480 and 515 nm respectively.\nTaking the fluorescence intensity of the Triton X-100 treated samples as 100% release, calculate the percentage of the released calcein at each time point, using the formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53619/53619formula1.jpg\n\tFt is the fluorescence intensity of solution at a given time point. Fi and Fx are the normalized initial and final fluorescence intensities of the solution respectively.\n4. Calcein Release from Liposomes with Pulsed Laser",
    "Transfer 100 µl liposome solution to a quartz cuvette and place it in a cuvette holder. Use a pulsed Nd:YAG laser with a pulse duration of 6 nsec at 532 nm wavelength as the light source. Use the following Laser Parameters — Repetition rate: 1 Hz; Laser energy density: 1 mJ/cm2; Beam diameter: 0.5 mm.\nGuide the collimated laser beam through the cuvette such that the light passes through the liposome solution and collect aliquots after various pulses.\nAdd 10 µl of 2% Triton X-100 to 2 ml aliquot of liposomal solution to digest the liposomes for 10 min at RT and to achieve complete release of calcein.\nConsidering calcein is sensitive to light and could be bleached during the laser experiment, pre-measure the bleaching effect of pulsed laser on calcein solution to normalize the data from liposome release.\n\t\nSpecifically, expose calcein solution (60 mM) to pulsed laser with frequency of 1 Hz for varying pulse numbers (0, 25, 50 and 100). Measure the fluorescence intensity of calcein with excitation and emission wavelengths of 480 and 515 nm respectively, before and after laser exposure.\nCalculate the amount of bleaching (fluorescence intensity of calcein before laser exposure/ fluorescence intensity of calcein after the specific pulse number). Use this factor to normalize the values obtained from liposome samples by multiplying the fluorescence intensity of the liposomes with the factor.\nMeasure the fluorescence intensity of the collected sample using a fluorescence microplate reader at excitation and emission wavelengths at 480 and 515 nm respectively.\nTaking the fluorescence intensity of the Triton X-100 treated samples as 100% release, calculate the percentage of the released calcein at each pulse number, using the formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53619/53619formula1.jpg",
    "Ft is the fluorescence intensity of solution at a given pulse number after normalization. Fi and Fx are the normalized initial and final fluorescence intensities of the solution respectively.\n5. Measurement of Pressure Impulses\nPlace 100 µl of the sample on a microscopic slide and set the focus of the laser onto the sample.\nImmerse a needle hydrophone (1 mm diameter and 450 nV/Pa sensitivity) into the solution.\n\tCaution: The hydrophone must not be illuminated by the laser light to avoid the damage.\nIrradiate the sample with the pulsed laser with varying pulse numbers (0-100) and pulse energy (20-160 µJ/pulse).\nRecord the pressure signals using a digital oscilloscope.\nSubscription Required.
