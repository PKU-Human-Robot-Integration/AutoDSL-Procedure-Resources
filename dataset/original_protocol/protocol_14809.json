    "All animals used in this study were cared for and handled according to the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research.\n1. Production of Recombinant AAV (rAAV) by Transient Transfection of HEK-293 Cells17,18\nNOTE: See McClure C, JoVE (2011)19.\nPurify a large-scale plasmid preparation (at least 1 mg/ml) of the AAV vector plasmids. Use 3 plasmids. The AAV helper plasmid carrying the replication and capsid genes without the AAV inverted terminal repeats ITRs, the transgene expression cassette carrying the AAV ITR referred to as the transfer plasmid, and the plasmid supplying the adenovirus helper genes E2, E4, and VA RNA genes referred to as pHELPER.\nTransfect 293 cells with these 3 plasmids using polyethyleneimine (or other transfection reagent). Above 80% of transfection efficiency is necessary for good viral yields.\nPurify recombinant AAV from 293 cell lysates on an iodixanol gradient. 15%, 25%, 40%, and 60% iodixanol is used to obtain the gradient. Collect 40% iodixanol fraction containing AAV particles, concentrate the fraction after ultracentrifugation at 500,000 x g for 1 hr and buffer exchange against PBS (phosphate buffered saline) with 0.001% Pluronic.\nTo determine viral genomic titer20, perform a DNAse ProteinaseK digest followed by QPCR. The forward and reverse primers amplify the 62 bp region located in the AAV2 ITR. For the plasmid standard, the probe is labeled with FAM and has a black hole quencher (BHQ).\nCarry out qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction)  in a final volume of 25 μl using 340 nM reverse ITR primer, 100 nM forward ITR primer, 100 nM AAV2 ITR probe, 0.4 mM dNTPs, 2 mM MgCl2, 1x Platinum Taq Buffer, 1U Platinum Taq and 5 μl template (standard, sample and no template control).",
    "For the standard, use the plasmid for transfection in 7 x 10-fold serial dilutions (5 µl each of 2 x 109 to 2 x 103 genomes/ml resulting in a final concentration from 1010 to 104 genomes/ml).\nBegin the program by an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 15 min followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at at 95 °C for 1 min and annealing/extension at 60 °C for 1 min. Store at 4 °C for a short-term storage or at -20 °C for long storage periods.\n2. Intravitreal Injection of AAV\nAnesthetize C57BL6J mice with ketamine (50 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) and verify the loss of righting reflex, the withdrawal reflex and tail pinch response indicating a proper anesthetization. Dilate pupils by corneal application of neosynephrine 5% and mydriaticum 0.5% eye drops. Use vet ointment on eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nPass an ultrafine 30 G disposable needle through the equator and next to the limbus, into the vitreous cavity (see Chiu K, JoVE (2007)21). Inject 1 µl stock containing 1 to 4 x 1011 vp of ShH10-GFP or AAV5-GFP with direct observation of the needle in the center of the vitreous cavity (Figure 1). Use one eye as a control for ILM experiments. Inject both eyes for BRB experiments. Apply an anti-inflammatory and antibacterial topical treatment on injected eyes.\nDilate pupils with neosynephrine and mydriaticum eye drops for imaging. Perform fundus examinations with an eye fundus camera to follow GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) expression 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 2 months after intravitreal injection (Figure 1). Sacrifice mice by CO2 inhalation 1 to 2 months post-injection.\n3. Immunohistochemistry\nFor retinal cryosections (Figure 1), dissect enucleated eyes to remove lens and cornea, and immersion fix in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 hr.",
    "Cryoprotect the previously fixed eyes in 10% sucrose for 1 hr at room temperature, 20% sucrose for another hr at room temperature. Cryoprotect in 30% sucrose solution, overnight at 4 °C. Freeze and embed eyecups in embedding resin such as Cryo-matrix. Make 10 µm cryosections and mount on slides specially treated for frozen tissue sections and that improve tissue adherence during staining.\nPermeabilize sections with 0.1% Triton X100 in PBS pH 7.4 for 5 min. Wash 2x in PBS and block for 1 hr at room temperature in PBS with 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20.\nFor retinal flatmounts (Figure 1), fix enucleated eyes in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min to facilitate the dissection.\n\t\nIn 15-30 min, dissect the eyes to remove the cornea and lens. Separate the retina from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and sclera by cutting around the ora serrata and the optic nerve. Immerse in 4% paraformaldehyde for another 30 min to fix the retina and the fluorescent protein in transduced retinal cells (fixation must not exceed 24 hr). Wash 5 min in sterile PBS, pH 7.4.\nChange the PBS to blocking buffer (PBS with 1% BSA, 2% normal goat or donkey serum, 0.5% Triton X-100), and incubate in blocking buffer for either 4 hr at room temperature or 4 °C overnight.\nIncubate tissues with primary antibodies in blocking buffer for either 4 hr at room temperature or at 4 °C overnight. Wash 3x with PBS.\n\tNOTE: The antibodies used are as follows: anti-laminin (1/1,000) labeling the ILM, anti-rhodopsin clone 4D2 (1/500) labeling rods, anti-glutamine synthetase clone GS-6 (1/1,500) labeling Müller cells, PNA Lectin (1/40) labeling cones.",
    "Incubate tissues with 1:500 dilution of alexa fluor conjugated secondary antibodies in blocking buffer for 1 hr (cryosections) or 2 hr (flatmounts) at room temperature and protected from light. Wash 3x with PBS.\nMake relieving cuts to the retina and flatmount it onto a glass slide with either the photoreceptor or retinal ganglion cell (RGC) side facing upwards. Add aqueous mountingmedium, apply coverslip and store at 4 °C.\nPerform confocal microscopy on laser-scanning confocal microscope. Acquire images sequentially, line by line, to reduce excitation and emission crosstalk. Define step size according to the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem. Use exposure settings that minimize oversaturated pixels in the final images. Process 12-bit images with FIJI, project Z-sections on a single plane using maximum intensity under Z-project function and finally convert to 8-bit RGB color mode.\n4. PCR Analysis of Mouse Blood Samples\nInject 100 µl stock containing 1 to 4 x 1011 particles of an AAV-GFP into the penile vein of anesthetized C57BL6J mice (5% of isoflurane for induction in a close chamber and 2.5% of isoflurane through a nose cone during surgery) using an insulin syringe with an ultra-fine 6 mm needle. This animal will serve as a positive control of circulating AAV particles.\nSample blood from mouse tail before injection and 3 hr, 24 hr, 2 days, and 3 days after ShH10 intravitreal injection or after intrapenile injection (Figure 1). About 10-20 µl is collected in heparin tubes. Sacrifice mice by CO2 inhalation after completion of the procedure.\nExtract genomic DNA from blood samples using the extraction kit of your choice.",
    "Perform PCR amplification of genomic DNA. For this protocol use the following primer pair: GFP, sense 5’-CGACACAATCTGCCCTTTCG-3’, antisense 5’-CATGGACGAGCTGTACAAGGGA-3’. The following PCR program was performed: 95 °C 2 min (1 cycle); 95 °C 45 sec, 55 °C 1 min, 72 °C 45 sec (30 cycles); 72°C 5 min (1 cycle); 4 °C hold.\n5. Optional Evans Blue Method\nNOTE: Quantify vascular permeability by measuring albumin leakage from blood vessels into the retina using the Evans blue method10.\nPrepare Evans Blue dye by dissolution in a normal saline solution (6 mg/ml), sonication for 5 min in an ultrasonic cleaner, and filtration through a 5 µm filter.\nAnesthetize C57BL6J mice (isoflurane inhalation, see step 4.1), check the loss of righting reflex, the withdrawal reflex and tail pinch response indicating a proper anesthetization, and inject Evans blue (45 mg/kg) through the penile vein (Figure 1). Check that paws, muzzle, and ears of mice become clearly blue following Evans blue injection, confirming the uptake and distribution of the dye.\nAnesthetize C57BL6J mice 3 hr after injection of the dye with ketamine (50 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) and verify the loss of righting reflex indicating a proper anesthetization. Sample intracardially about 500 µl of blood in heparin tubes and perfuse mice for 2 min via the left ventricle with a citrate buffer (0.05 M, pH 3.5; dissolve 7.8 g of citric acid and 3.8 g of sodium citrate in 1 L of distilled water) pre-warmed to 37 °C to prevent vasoconstriction. Mice are sacrificed via the perfusion.",
    "After perfusion, enucleate and carefully dissect both eyes under an operating microscope to collect the retinas (see Section 3.2). Dry retinas in a centrifugal evaporator overnight, weigh, and extract the Evans blue dye by incubating retinas with 100 μl of formamide for 18 hr at 65 °C with shaking (100 x g). Centrifuge retina samples in 30K omega filter tubes at 20,798.5 x g for 2 hr at 4 °C and centrifuge blood samples at 20,798.5 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.\nUse both supernatants to measure absorbance. Determine absorbance of each sample by subtracting the absorbance maximum for Evans blue at 620 nm to the absorbance minimum at 740 nm. Calculate Evans blue concentration in plasma and retina from a standard curve of Evans blue in formamide. Express BRB permeability in microliter of Evans blue per gram of dry retina per hour (µl plasma/g retinal dry wt/hr).\n6. Optional Fluorescein Angiography\nNOTE: Leakage from retinal blood vessels in mice can be visualized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium fluorescein.\nAnesthetize C57BL6J mice (isoflurane inhalation, see step 4.1) and dilate pupils with eye drops (neosynephrine and mydriaticum). Use vet ointment on eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nInject intraperitoneally 0.01-0.02 ml of 10% sodium fluorescein in 0.1 ml sterile saline for fluorescein angiography.\nCollect images of both eyes after injection using an eye fundus camera. Sacrifice mice by CO2 inhalation after the procedure.\n\tNOTE: 20 sec are necessary for the retinal vessels to become visible on angiography. Images have to be captured between 3-10 min maximum after fluorescein injection. The leakage spots (if present) are observable after 2.5 min. At later time points the image quality is lost due to sodium fluorescein diffusing into the vitreous, thus only images shortly obtained after are used for analysis.",
