For each fluorophore, the corresponding fluorescence filter cube needs to be manually switched. A filter cube for the bright field imaging must be used to keep the same optical path.\nAdjust the exposure time manually prior to image acquisition using Acquire | Camera Settings command for each fluorophore as summarized in Table 3.

In this experiment, the scale was set from 500 up to 12,000 approximately.\nAutomate the capture using a multipoint acquisition program using both XY scan and multiple wavelength options in that specific order. Ensure that the stage moves to the initial position, capture all the different wavelengths, and then proceed to the next position.\nFirst, set-up the XY scan by customizing the XY scan profile in the XY scan menu of the software. In ‘Custom Multipoint Definition’, choose the large image definition box and set it to 40.0 x 1.0 mm approximately (the length of the emulsion filling). Use 1% overlap.\nEnable the ‘Use Focus Surface’ option and set up the focus surface curve by adjusting the focus plane at different points on the sample using the focus knob on the microscope.\nSecond, setup the multiple wavelength scan by selecting the scan tab. Add each of the optical configurations created in step 6.1.7 for each wavelength.\nClick the option to close active shutter during stage movement and during filter change to avoid bleaching the sample and run the acquisition by pressing the ‘Start Run’ button.

Use brightfield droplet images to identify objects, then use objects as mask to measure intensity of fluorescent images.\nRun pipeline with selected tiff images to extract average fluorescence intensity of fluorescence droplet images. Conduct the experiment in triplicate, with each set consisting of ~5,000 droplets for analysis.\nApply the ‘definetherain’ algorithm (http://definetherain.org.uk/) to identify the positive and negative droplet clusters. The positives should be within 3 standard deviations of the mean. This determines the threshold intensity of positive droplets to be used for counting.\nAgain use the image analysis software to implement a new pipeline where the fluorescence threshold for each gene target is set as defined in the previous step.\nUpload brightfield and fluorescent images to pipeline. Add modules ‘ColorToGray’, ‘RescaleIntensity’, ‘Threshold’, ‘IdentifyPrimaryObjects’, ‘MeasureObjectSizeShape’, ‘FilterObjects’, and ‘ExportToSpreadsheet’. Create unique modules for brightfield images and each fluorescence filter for droplets.\nRescale image intensity scale from 0 to 1 for each fluorescence image group. Then set the threshold to identify and count the objects above the established threshold. If necessary, add ‘ExpandOrShrinkObjects’ module to shrink objects to facilitate the counting and identification of droplets in brightfield.\nOnly identify objects within selected size of 20-30 pixels and filter the counted objects to only retain those objects with a specific diameter (i.e., droplets in the 75 µm diameter range) and a round spherical eccentricity of 0.5 and below.\nExport the results to a table that lists the total droplet count from brightfield images, as well as droplet counts of all the fluorescence channels used; namely Cy5 for C-LESS gene, HEX for methylated CD3Z gene, and FAM for methylated FOXP3 gene (see Supplementary Information for raw experimental data obtained for the presented mdPCR assay).",
