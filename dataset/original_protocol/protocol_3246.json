    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCalibrate machine for respirometry\nTiming: 60 min\nRespirometry calibration is the major step and prerequisite to obtain accurate measurement of oxygen respiration.\nOpen DatLab software3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] and connect to Oxygraph-2k (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3014-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. The Oxygraph-2k Respirometer system\nRinse chambers with 3 cycles of water and 100% ethanol. Leave the chamber dry enough for 15 min.\nNote: Avoid touching the polarographic oxygen sensor inside the chamber during suctioning washout and titrating.\nFill the chamber with 2.4 mL pre-warmed (37°C) MiR05.\nNote: Keep MiR05 in 37°C during the test to reduce bubbles introduced from environment to the chamber.\nFollow the standard Air and zero calibration protocol for Oxygraph. Refer to https://wiki.oroboros.at/index.php/Oxygen_calibration_-_DatLab[href=https://wiki.oroboros.at/index.php/Oxygen_calibration_-_DatLab] for details and troubleshooting (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3014-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Trace of Oxygraph calibration\nNote: Zero voltage should not exceed 5% of the voltage at air saturation procedure to achieve calibration.\nAfter calibration, rinse chambers with 3 cycles of water and 100% ethanol. After drying, fill the chamber with 2.4 mL pre-warmed MiR05. Close the insert. The Oxygraph is ready for use now.\nTissue preparation\nTiming: 30 min\nColon tissue was collected from the adult rat, and stored at −80°C. We recommend tissue be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen to reserve mitochondrial activity.\nWeigh 50 mg frozen tissues in 500 μL ice-cold mitochondria assay buffer. Cut tissues into ∼10 pieces.\nNote: Cutting into pieces helps with the homogenization of the tissue.\nHomogenize with 15–20 stokes in Teflon-glass homogenizer.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] Transfer all homogenate into a clean 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3014-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Overview of sample preparation steps\nCentrifuge homogenate at 1,000 g for 15 min at 4°C.\nNote: Low temperature is essential to reserve mitochondria activity.\nMeasure oxygen respiration\nTiming: 60 min",
    "This step is core to analyze mitochondrial bioenergetics. Mitochondrial oxygen respiration will be detected with Oxygraph-2k.\nAdd 100 μL supernatant with pipette to Oxygraph chamber. Close the chamber. Wait for 5–10 min until the curve of oxygen consumption rate (red curve) is stable.\nNote: Avoid pipetting solid tissue residues into the chamber.\nCritical: Supernatant amount is important to measure oxygen respiration. Excess or insufficient amounts could trigger improper mitochondrial responses. The amount should be optimized for other tissue types. For example, a different amount is used for skeletal muscle.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] For mice, 10 mg of frozen colon tissue is recommended based on previous testing in our laboratory.\nTitrate 10 μL NADH solution to the chamber (final concentration, 0.05 mM) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). Record 3–5 min of stable Complex I-linked respiration.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3014-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Titrate substrates/inhibitors\nCritical: Carefully clean Hamilton syringe three times with 100% EtOH and ddH2O after each injection.\nCritical: Store substrates and inhibitors on ice and protect from light during the day of experiment.\nTitrate 1 μL Oligomycin to the chamber (final concentration, 2 μg/mL). Record 3–5 min of stable ATP production-linked respiration.\nNote: The concentration for substrate and inhibitor stocks refers to those concentrations for brain7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7],8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8],9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] and liver tissues.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]\nTitrate 20 μL succinate to the chamber (final concentration, 10 mM). Record 3–5 min of stable Complex II-linked respiration.\nStep-wise titration of 1 μL FCCP to the chamber until achieving the stable maximal respiration.\nNote: FCCP is light sensitive. It decomposes and loses its activity when exposed to light. Handle and store rotenone in dark conditions such as aluminum foil to preserve activity.\nCritical: FCCP is harmful if swallowed. It causes severe skin burns and eye damage and may cause skin allergy. In case of eye or skin contact, wash thoroughly immediately with plenty of water.",
    "Titrate 1 μL rotenone to the chamber (final concentration, 0.05 μM). Record 3–5 min of stable Complex IV-linked respiration.\nNote: Rotenone is light sensitive. It decomposes and loses its activity when exposed to light. Handle and store rotenone in dark conditions such as aluminum foil to preserve activity.\nCritical: Rotenone is fatal if swallowed and inhaled. It causes skin irritation, serious eye irritation and may cause respiratory irritation. In case of eye or skin contact, wash thoroughly immediately with plenty of water.\nTitrate 2.5 μL Antimycin A to the chamber (final concentration, 2.5 μM). Record 3–5 min of residual non-mitochondria respiration.\nCritical: Antimycin A is fatal if swallowed.\nCollect all of the solution in the chamber to a 2 mL Eppendorf tube.\nWash the chamber with 3 cycles of water and 100% ethanol to remove EtOH-soluble inhibitors. Dry the chamber totally for 20–30 min before testing next sample.\nNote: Please wash more times if there is residue left in the chamber.\nMeasure protein concentration\nTiming: 60 min\nThis step measures protein concentration in supernatant for normalizing oxygen respiration.\nMeasure the protein concentration in supernatant collected in step 8 using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]) for normalization purposes.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3014-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Linear standard curve from BCA assay\nNote: Other BCA protein assay kits or reliable assays can also be used to determine total protein concentration of the assessed sample.\nPut the concentration value in DatLab to normalize the value of oxygen respiration rate."
