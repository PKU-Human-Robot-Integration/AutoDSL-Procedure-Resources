    "1. Aggregation assays on fluorescence plate readers\nNOTE: The protocol described here is an example of how to study the aggregation of any protein or peptide by chemical kinetics. In particular, it describes an optimized protocol to study the aggregation of the Aβ42 peptide, which is involved in the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease58,59. A similar protocol can be adjusted and adopted towards studying the aggregation of any protein or peptide.\nObtain a highly pure monomeric solution of Aβ42 through ion-exchange and size-exclusion chromatography techniques to distinguish protein fractions containing Aβ42, and to isolate the monomeric fraction from other aggregated forms of Aβ42 obtained58,59.\nDilute the Aβ42 peptide in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 200 µM EDTA at pH 8.058 to a desired final concentration ranging between 1−5 µM, in 1.5 mL low-bind tubes. Samples collected for AFM measurements should not contain the fluorescent dye used in the aggregation assay (thioflavin T, ThT), as it might introduce artefacts during sample deposition for AFM analysis. Thus, prepare triplicates of two identical solutions: i) the first containing monomeric Aβ42 to follow the process of aggregation by AFM; ii) the second containing the Aβ42 monomeric with addition of 20 µM ThT as a tracer to monitor the kinetics of aggregation.\n\tNOTE: It is important to perform steps 1.1 and 1.2 on ice. This procedure is to ensure that the monomeric Aβ42 solution does not aggregate until initiated in the plate reader. When handling samples, careful pipetting is essential to avoid the introduction of any air bubbles that may affect the protein sample.\nPipette 80 µL of each sample in each well of a 96-well, half-area plate of black polystyrene with clear bottom and nonbinding surfaces.",
    "Seal the plate with a foil to minimize the evaporation of the sample over the course of the aggregation.\nEquilibrate the temperature of the plate reader to 37 °C.\nSet up the aggregation protocol to read fluorescence measurements at fixed time-point intervals, at an excitation wavelength of 440 nm and an emission wavelength of 480 nm. The aggregation should be initiated in quiescent conditions.\nInsert the plate into the plate reader.\n\tNOTE: It is important to be careful while handling the plate, to ensure that the aggregation is not triggered prior to starting the plate reader. Use the gain adjustment settings to ensure the optimal readout of the fluorescence of each sample.\nStart the measurement.\n\tNOTE: The aggregation experiment is concluded when the ThT fluorescence sigmoidal curve reaches a plateau58.\n2. Sample preparation for AFM and nano-IR measurements\nGlue highest quality grade V1 mica disc to high quality magnetic stainless-steel disc using adhesive tabs or double-sided tape.\nEtch mica by placing a piece of adhesive tape onto the mica surface and pulling off the top layer of the mica. This procedure will produce clean, atomically flat surface, suitable for sample deposition.\n\tNOTE: Etched surface must be uniform and smooth.\n\tCAUTION: Do not touch or breathe directly above freshly etched mica, as this will introduce artefacts.\nPause/stop the plate reader measurement to collect the time point of interest during the aggregation process of the protein.\nRemove the sealing foil and collect 10 µL aliquot of the samples without ThT from the well into a 1.5 mL low-bind tubes.\nDeposit the 10 µL of the sample on the freshly etched mica. For AFM-IR measurements samples must be deposited on freshly stripped gold substrate.\nIncubate the solution on the mica for 1 min to allow physisorbtion.",
    "NOTE: Longer incubation time would allow better absorption on the surface but may induce artificial self-organization and self-assembly25. To avoid these effects, spray deposition may be exploited25.\nRinse three times with 1 mL of ultrapure water.\nDry under a gentle flow of nitrogen to measure the sample in air environment.\n3. AFM imaging of the morphology of protein aggregates\nNOTE: Morphology measurements can be performed both in contact and dynamic mode, in the following steps the latter is described since it reduces lateral forces to measure the 3D morphology of the sample with high resolution. AFM-IR measurements will be performed in contact mode to enhance AFM-IR signal-to-noise ratio.\nTurn on the AFM system at least 30 min before the measurements in order to enable the system to reach thermal stability. Click on Setup, then on Probe. In Probe Change window click on Next to prepare Z, Focus Stage.\nTurn off the AFM beam switch (if it is on). Unlock the dovetail locks, disconnect the head from the system and in Probe Change window click on Next.\nMount the AFM cantilever on the probe holder. Connect the head to the system and lock the dovetail locks.\n\tNOTE: Optimal cantilevers to study biological samples in dynamic mode AFM have spring constant ranging between 2−40 N m-1 and an apex radii ranging between 2−8 nm14.\nTurn on the AFM laser beam switch and in Probe Change window click on Next.\nIn the pop-up window click on No if the cantilever type did not change. Adjust optical alignment knobs to find the cantilever. Adjust focus onto cantilever and click on Next.\nIn the pop-up window click on Yes if the focus is on the cantilever.",
    "Position the laser beam at the end of the cantilever using the knobs controlling position of the detection laser. Maximize the total signal measured by the four-quadrant photodiode to at least >1 V using the knobs controlling the position of the deflected laser beam on the position sensitive photodiode (PSPD). In Probe Change window click on Next and then on Close.\nWait 15 min for the cantilever to reach thermal stability. Readjust the position of the deflected laser beam on the PSPD if necessary.\nClick on NCM SWEEP, choose desired amplitude of oscillation, click on Use Phase, click on auto and tune the cantilever close to the maximum of its first free resonance of oscillation, which is of approximately 300 kHz for a cantilever with a spring constant of 40 N m-1.\n\tNOTE: Tuning the cantilever out of the maximum of its free resonance assures higher stability of the measurements14.\nPlace the sample on the sample holder. Choose suitable imaging parameters. Typical scanning rate is 0.3−1.0 Hz for a scan area of 1 x 1 µm2 to 5 x 5 µm2. Typical resolution needed is between 256 x 256 and 1024 x 1024 pixels. Click on Scan Area to choose the scan size and the pixel number.\nFocus the optical view on the sample. Click on Approach to approach the sample surface. Once approach is completed click on Lift 100 µm to rise the AFM tip 100 µm above the surface of the sample. Click Expand on the optical image of the sample. Click on the Focus Stage bar to focus the view on the surface of the sample.",
    "Use the arrows to move in the region of the sample of interest. Engage the surface by pressing Approach button. Click on Line Scan button, and check if the tip is following the surface well, if necessary, adjust the Set Point.\nStart imaging the sample surface by pressing Scan button. During imaging, to avoid large imaging force and keep consistency of within independent samples, maintain a constant regime of phase change not exceeding Δ20°42.\nEnter file name and choose base directory where the acquired image will be saved.\n4. Infrared nanospectroscopy measurements of protein aggregates\nTurn on the AFM-IR system and the infrared (IR) laser60 30−60 min before measurements for thermal stabilization. Typical lasers for AFM-IR instruments are optical parameter oscillators (OPO) and quantum cascade lasers (QCL).\nOpen the built-in software to control the instrument. Click on file and then on new to open a new nanoIR file. Press the button initialise to start the AFM-IR system.\nOpen the instrument cover and mount on the AFM-IR system a silicon gold coated probe with a nominal radius of 30 nm and a spring constant of 0.2 N/m to measure the sample in contact mode.\nClick on Load in the section AFM probe and then next. In focus on probe section click on the arrows to focus the camera on the cantilever. In the section sample XY movement, use the arrows to place the cross-air at the end of the cantilever.\nRotate the knobs controlling the position of the detection laser to position laser at the end of the cantilever. Rotate the laser knobs to detect and maximize the sum measured by the four-quadrant photodiode to a value >3 V. Rotate the deflection knob to adjust the cantilever deflection to -1 V and then click next. Close the cover of the instrument.",
    "In the section focus on sample use the arrows to focus the camera on the sample. Then, in the section sample XY movement use the arrows to move in the region of interest of the sample and click on approach and engage.\nIn the microscope window select as inputs the channels of interest to map the biophysical properties of the sample. In particular, choose height for morphology, Amplitude 2 for IR absorption and PLL frequency to map tip-sample contact resonance.\nIn the AFM scan section of the controls window, use similar parameters as in section 3 (i.e., scan rate 0.1−1.0 Hz, between 256 x 256 and 1024 x 1024 pixels). Choose as value of the gains according to sample roughness: integral I = 1−10 and proportional P = 10−30. Then, click on scan to acquire a morphology map.\n\tNOTE: The morphology can be similarly measured in the dynamic tapping mode, but AFM-IR measurements are performed here in the contact mode to have higher signal to noise ratios.\nAfter the mapping of morphology is finished, in the microscope window, click on the height map to position the probe on the top of one aggregate. Then in the nanoIR section of the controls window, click on start IR to illuminate the sample with the IR laser.\nTo focus the infrared laser on the cantilever, click on optimisation. In this window, write a wavenumber where the sample is going to have high absorbance and click add. For protein, a typical value is 1655 cm-1. Click on scan to find the IR laser position and click on update to align its position with the cantilever. Close the window.",
    "In the section general of the nanoIR setting, write a wavenumber where high absorbance in the relative field is expected. Then, deactivate the Band Pass Filter option and look at the meter reading and at the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the cantilever response. In the FFT window move the green cursor to read the resonance frequency of the cantilever. A typical value of the FFT of the resonance of the cantilevers is around 300 kHz. Write this resonance frequency value in the general section in the freq. centre field and use a freq. window of 50 kHz.\n\tNOTE: Select a laser power that is low enough to not saturate the meter reading and to have distortion in the cantilever response and to not overheat the sample.\nClick on laser pulse tune window to use the resonance enhanced mode. Choose a frequency centre of 300 kHz, a tune range of 50 kHz and a duty cycle of the laser of 5%. Click on acquire to sweep the pulse rate of the laser. By using the cursor in the graph, tune the laser pulse to the frequency of the mechanical response of the thermal expansion of the sample absorbing the IR light. Then, select the option PLL to monitor the contact resonance between the sample and the tip. Press the zero button in the PLL window and tick enable to track the sample-tip contact resonance. Choose an integral gain I = 0.5 and proportional gain P = 10. Close the window.\nOpen again the optimisation window and find the position of the IR laser for at least 3 wavenumbers corresponding to major absorbance bands of the sample (amide band I-II-III) and for at least one wavenumber for each chip of the laser.",
    "Click on Tools | IR Background Calibration | New. In the window select the spectroscopic region of interest (1800−1200 cm-1 to study protein samples); choose the same pulse rate as determined in step 4.12 and a duty cycle of 5%; click on fast acquisition and select the laser speed, typical range for a quantum cascade laser is between 20−500 cm-1. Click on acquire to measure the IR laser background. This background spectrum will be used for normalization of measured nanoscale localized spectra. Close the window.\n\tNOTE: If a fast laser and resonance enhanced mode is not available, skip step 4.12 and select stepped spectra instead of fast in both the background and IR spectra acquisition windows. However, single aggregate sensitivity will not be reached.\nIn the IR spectra settings, choose an IR spectrum resolution between 1−4 cm-1 and a number of co-averages of at least 64x. Click on acquire to measure a nanoscale localized IR spectrum in the protein range (1800−1200 cm-1).\nTo acquire a nanoscale resolved chemical map, select IR imaging option, choose a wavenumber of interest (e.g., 1655 cm-1 for amide band I) and click on scan in the AFM scan window.\nOnce the mapping is completed, go to file and save the measurements. To analyze the acquired maps of morphology, contact-resonance and chemistry, as well as the nanoscale localized spectra, use the built-in AFM image processing software. Spectra and Images can be saved as .csv or .axz files for further detailed analysis with commercial software.\n5. Image processing and analysis of cross-sectional dimensions\nFlatten raw images14,17,19,41,42,59 using built-in AFM image processing software or commercial software.\n\tNOTE: The aggregates should be masked from the calculation to avoid artefacts of analysis and underestimation of their measured height.\nFlatten the image by 0 order plane fit subtraction.",
    "Flatten the image by plane and then line by line at a 1st regression order, the second step is repeated until the flat baseline in line profile of the image is reached.\nIf the sample is very crowded, contains exceptionally high aggregates or scanner bow artefact is present, flatten image using 2nd regression order fit.\nMeasure aggregate height and width from a line profile taken perpendicular to the fibril axis14,17,19,41,42,59.\nMeasure fibril length parallel to the fibril axis14,17,19,41,42,59.\nSubscription Required.
