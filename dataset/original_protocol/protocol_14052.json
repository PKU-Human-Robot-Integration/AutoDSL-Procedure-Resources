    "Experiments must comply with national and institutional regulations concerning the use of animals for research purposes. Permissions to carry out experiments must be obtained. The treatment of animals and experimental procedures of the study adhere to the Nankai University Animal Care and Use Committee Guidelines that conform to the Guidelines for Animal Care approved by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n1. LV-Rluc-RFP (RR) and LV-Rluc-RFP-HSV-ttk (RRT) lentiviral packaging and production\nNOTE: The pLV-RR carries the gene sequences of Renilla luciferase (Rluc) and red fluorescent protein (RFP) under the promoter EF1α, whereas the pLV-RRT carries the gene sequences coding Rluc, RFP, and herpes simplex virus truncated thymidine kinase (HSV-ttk) (Figure 2).\nSeed 1 x 106 of 293T cells per well into a 6 well plate and culture overnight in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C with Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).\nPrepare the liposome suspension: mix 7.5 µL of liposome and 0.25 mL of minimal essential medium (MEM) into a 1.5 mL tube following incubation for 5 min at room temperature (RT) to disperse liposomes equally.\nPrepare the DNAs solution (DNAs-RR): separately, add the pLV-RR vector and helper plasmids to 0.25 mL of MEM in a 1.5 mL tube as described in Table 1.\nObtain the liposome/DNAs-RR compound: gently add the DNAs-RR solution into prepared liposome suspension drop by drop and incubate for 20 min at RT so the DNA bonds to the lipid membrane.\nReplace the medium of the 293T cells with 1 mL of DMEM containing 10% FBS and add the liposome/DNAs-RR compound to the medium of the 293T cells gently.",
    "After incubating in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 12–16 h, replace the liposome/DNAs-RR compound containing medium of the 293T cells with 1 mL of DMEM containing 10% FBS and 100 U/mL penicillin−streptomycin.\nContinue culturing the 293T cells in the humidified incubator for 48 h after transfection. Then, collect the supernatant of the 293T cells and centrifuge the medium at 300 x g for 5 min to pellet the 293T cells. Transfer the lentivirus-RR (LV-RR)-containing supernatant into 1.5 mL sterile polypropylene storage tubes and store at -80 °C.\n\tNOTE: A Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) facility is required in order to work with recombinant lentivirus.\nRepeat steps 1.1–1.7 and use pLV-RRT vector instead of pLV-RR vector in step 1.3 to obtain the lentivirus-RRT (LV-RRT). Store the LV-RRT at -80 °C.\n\tNOTE: The non-purified lentiviral stock may inhibit cell growth in some cases. Lentiviral stock may need to be purified. The lentiviral stocks containing LV-RR or LV-RRT particles should be divided into 1.5 mL tubes (1 mL per tube) for storage to avoid multiple free-thaw cycles.\n2. LV-RR and LV-RRT lentiviral transduction for gene expression in 4T1 cells\nSeed 4T1 cells into a 6-well plate (5 x 105 cells/well) and culture with Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium containing 10% FBS overnight in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C.\nRemove the medium from the culture plate and replace it with 1 mL fresh RPMI 1640 medium as well as 1 mL of lentiviral stock (LV-RR or LV-RRT) to each well. Add 8 µg/mL polybrene and gently blend the medium containing lentiviral particles by pipetting up and down.\n\tNOTE: Please be aware that the medium contains lentiviral particles, which could transduce human cells.",
    "Spin transduction solution in a centrifuge at 1,000 × g for 60 min at RT to help increase transduction efficiency. After centrifugation, culture 4T1 cells for 4–12 h and maintain in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: For some cell lines, polybrene may be toxic for long-term culture. Therefore, the incubation time for transducing different cells may be changeable. Check the cell status multiple times to find appropriate incubation time.\nRefresh the medium of transduced 4T1 cells with 2 mL of RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS and 100 U/mL penicillin−streptomycin to remove lentiviral particles and polybrene.\n3. Drug screening and identification of LV-RR and LV-RRT transduced 4T1 cells\nSelect transduced cells with medium containing blasticidin (BSD) according to the BSD-resistance gene carried by LV-RR or LV-RRT as the following steps described.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, the transduced cells which are RFP-positive could be selected by flow cytometry according to the RFP gene carried by LV-RR or LV-RRT.\n48 h after transduction, passage 4T1 cells at the ratio of 1:3 to 1:4 with selection medium (RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin−streptomycin, and 5 µg/mL BSD). Change medium every 2 or 3 days.\n\tNOTE: The optimal BSD concentration may vary from cell line to cell line. Therefore, a pilot experiment of kill curve should be performed to determine the optimal concentration of BSD before initial experiment.\n7 days post-drug screening, observe the LV-RR transduced 4T1 cells (4T1-RR) and LV-RRT transduced 4T1 cells (4T1-RRT) under the fluorescence inverted phase-contrast microscope. Count the number of RFP+ 4T1 cells and all 4T1 cells in three fields of vision to estimate the RFP-positive ratio, respectively (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, the RFP-positive ratio of transduced 4T1 cells could be identified by flow cytometry.",
    "Measure the renilla signals of 4T1-RR cells and 4T1-RRT cells by using a living imaging system to detect the linear relationship between cell numbers and renilla signals (Figure 3).\nExpand BSD-screened 4T1-RR and 4T1-RRT cells with selection medium at split ratios between 1:3 and 1:4 and store the cell line stocks in liquid nitrogen.\n4. Vegfr2-Fluc-KI mice and tumor-bearing mouse model\nNOTE: The transgenic Vegfr2-Fluc-KI mice, 6-8 weeks old and female, are used in this experiment to non-invasively monitor angiogenesis in vivo by BLI.\nCulture 4T1-RR cells and 4T1-RRT cells in 60 mm Petri dishes in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C, respectively. When the cells are at 80% confluence, remove the medium and rinse with phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\nRemove the PBS and add an additional 2 mL of 0.25% trypsin-0.53 mM EDTA solution respectively. Keep the dish at RT (or at 37 °C) until the cells detach.\nAdd 5–10 mL of fresh medium containing 10% FBS, then aspirate and dispense cells to resuspend 4T1-RR and 4T1-RRT cells into 15 mL centrifuge tubes, respectively. Count two types of 4T1 cells using a counting chamber and prepare the cell suspensions at a concentration of 1 x 106 per 100 µL in RPMI 1640 medium.\nAnesthetize the Vegfr2-Fluc-KI mice with 1%–3% isoflurane in 100% oxygen at anesthesia induction chamber with a flow rate of 1 L/min. Monitor the toe pinch response of the mouse to confirm the status of anesthesia. Then, apply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes of mouse to prevent dehydration.\nRemove mouse from chamber and position in nosecone. Entirely remove the hair of the shoulder of mouse by using electric shaver and hair removal cream, which could provide a good view of surgical field and avoid blocking the BLI signals in following-up experiments.",
    "Subcutaneously inject 4T1-RR cells (1 x 106 cells at a 100 µL total volume) and 4T1-RRT cells (1 x 106 cells at a 100 µL total volume) in left and right shoulders of each mouse, respectively (record as Day 0). Place mice in recovery area with thermal support until fully recovered.\nAfter implantation of 4T1-RR and 4T1-RRT cells, touch the tumor masses to check that the mice are tumor-bearing every day (Figure S1). At day 7 post-implantation, intraperitoneally inject 50 mg/kg ganciclovir (GCV) to the tumor-bearing mice two times per day until the end of experiment.\n\tNOTE: Before this experiment, the cytotoxic of GCV on 4T1-RRT cells should be detected. The killing efficiency of GCV could be evaluated by cell counting assay with different concentration of GCV (Figure S2).\nOn the day 0, 3, 7, 14, and 21 after 4T1 implantation, monitor the tumor growth and angiogenesis of tumor-bearing mice and assess by both Rluc and Fluc imaging (Figure 4).\n5. Dual bioluminescence imaging of tumor (Rluc) and angiogenesis (Fluc)\nOpen the living imaging system, initialize the living imaging software, and then initialize the system.\n\tNOTE: The system initialization will take few minutes to cool down the charge-coupled device (CCD) camera to -90 °C before able to start imaging. The temperature will turn green when the CCD camera is cooled.\nUse the following camera settings:\n\tCheck the Luminescence and Photograph.\n\tCheck Overlay.\n\tLuminescence settings:\n\tExposure Time sets AUTO in normal conditions.\n\tBinning sets to 8.\n\tF/Stop sets to 1.\n\tEmission Filter sets Open.\n\tPhotograph settings:\n\tBinning sets to medium.\n\tF/Stop sets to 8.\n\tIVIS system settings:\n\tField of view: C=1 mouse view, D=5 mice view.\n\tSubject height sets 1.5 cm.\nWeigh and record the mice and calculate the volume of coelenterazine (CTZ; 2.5 mg/kg) and D-luciferin (150 mg/kg) needed.",
    "Anesthetize tumor-bearing mouse by 1%–3% isoflurane in 100% oxygen at anesthesia induction chamber with a flow rate of 1 L/min. Monitor the toe pinch response of the mouse to confirm the status of anesthesia. Then, dispense a drop of lubricating eye ointment onto both eyes to avoid corneal damage.\nInject 2.5 mg CTZ (3.33 mg/mL) per kilogram body weight into the retrobulbar of the mouse (e.g., for a 20 g mouse, inject 15 μL to deliver 50 μg of CTZ) by using an insulin syringe needle.\nMove the tumor-bearing mouse into the camera chamber with its nose in the anesthesia cone gently and acquire several pictures of the mouse dorsal immediately to get the Rluc signals from 4T1 cells until the BLI signals fade away.\n\tNOTE: The half-life of CTZ is very short and the signals of Rluc drop precipitously ~30 s. To ensure any residual Rluc signal has dissipated and the interval between Rluc and Fluc imaging should be more than 10 min.\nIntraperitoneally inject 150 mg/kg D-luciferin (30 mg/mL) using an insulin syringe needle (e.g., for a 20 g mouse, inject 100 μL to deliver 3 mg of D-luciferin). Keep the mouse at RT for 10 min before Fluc imaging.\nMove this mouse into camera chamber with its nose in the anesthesia cone again and acquire several pictures of the mouse dorsal to get the Fluc signals from angiogenesis.\n\tNOTE: The Fluc kinetic monitor should be performed for each mouse until the signals reach the maximum and then fade.\nRepeat the procedures steps 5.4–5.8 for each mouse.\nAfter imaging, maintain the mice in a warm environment until animals wake up.\nAt the desired time point (day 3, 7, 14, and 21), repeat above procedures (step 5.3–5.10) to detect the tumor progression and tumor angiogenesis over time.",
    "Analyze the Rluc and Fluc signals data to investigate the relationship between the tumor growth and angiogenesis in tumor progression.\n\tNOTE: The regions of interest (ROI) which cover the BLI signal site are used to analyze the data. Measure the total radiance (Photons) of ROI in the unit of Photons/seconds/cm2/steradian (p/s/cm2/sr) for every timepoint.\nAnalyze the Rluc and Fluc signals of ROI by using graphics software (Figure 4).\nSubscription Required.
