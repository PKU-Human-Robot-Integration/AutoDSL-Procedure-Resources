  "procedures": [
    "Human muscle samples were obtained from the vastus lateralis from n = 3 (2 males, 1 female), aged 70-74 years old under sterile conditions using local anesthesia (Xylocaine) and a Bergstrom needle modified for manual suction11,12. Samples were a subset of a previous study approved by the Victoria University Human Research Ethics Committee (HRETH11/221) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki13. Participants provided written, informed consent to participate in this study. Full details of all materials required for this protocol are shown in the Table of Materials. In addition, a list of troubleshooting strategies addressing common protocol issues is provided in Table 1.\n1. Freeze drying\nWhile keeping the biopsied muscle samples frozen on dry ice, weigh and tare an empty frozen tube on the scales.\nQuickly weigh a minimum of 10 mg of wet weight frozen tissue. Record the weight to one decimal place.\nDeposit the tissue into the precooled microcentrifuge tube that has had 3-4 holes pierced into the lid and place it into a small beaker with 2-3 pellets of dry ice.\nFollow the freeze-dryer manufacturer's operating instructions.\nEnsure that all the valves on the freeze dryer are closed and switch on the freeze dryer.\nUse the control panel to check that the vacuum set point is programmed for optimal freeze-drying conditions for human tissue, 0.12 millibar (mBar) (Figure 2).\nPress manual on the freeze dryer and wait until the chamber has cooled to −40 oC.\nOnce the chamber has reached that temperature, remove the lid, then the glass chamber, and place the beaker (with muscle sample) onto the metal stage.\nReplace the glass chamber and lid. Close the vacuum release valve on the lid and wait until the vacuum scale light turns green to ensure the dryer is vacuum sealed.",
    "Freeze-dry the muscle samples for 48 h. Once freeze drying is complete, turn off the vacuum pump by pressing the vacuum button and open the vacuum release valve on the lid.\nRemove the lid of the chamber and collect the freeze-dried sample. Weigh the tissue and record the weight to one decimal place.\nCalculate the percentage loss of weight; ~75% decrease in weight indicates the tissue is successfully freeze-dried (in this work, mean ± SD, 76 ± 9%, n = 11 muscle samples).\nPress AUTO to switch off the vacuum pump and freezer. Allow the unit to reach ambient temperature.\nClean the cooling coils according to the manufacturer's instructions and drain accumulated liquid from the collector.\n\t​NOTE: Fiber collection can commence immediately. When tissue is not being used for fiber isolation, keep the freeze-dried sample at -80 °C in a sealed container with desiccator beads.  CAUTION: Dry ice is hazardous (Class 9); refer to the MSDS for recommended safe handling.\n2. Fiber collection\nFiber collection preparation\n\t\nLabel a minimum of 50 microfuge tubes (Fiber 1 to 50) and pipette 10 µL of denaturing buffer to each tube.\nPrepare the collection area with two pairs of fine tissue dissecting forceps, lint-free tissue, a benchtop lamp, a stereomicroscope (with the black stage up), a vortex, and a benchtop centrifuge.\nPlace the freeze-dried muscle sample onto a Petri dish lid. Place the lid on the stage of the dissecting microscope.\nWatch the video of single-fiber dissection. Practice the complete protocol from fiber collection to single-fiber type identification at least twice before commencing a study.",
    "Prior to fiber collection, calculate the total volume required for a fiber type sample from each biopsy as follows. For example, if the starting volume of 1 fiber = 10 µL and the volume remaining after MyDoBID is (1 fiber × 10 µL) - 1 µL used for dot blotting = 9 µL (sample volume), calculate the total sample volume required by multiplying the sample volume (µL) by the total number of western blots that will be run and double this amount to account for redundancy: (9 µL × 4 western blots) × 2 = 72 µL. Calculate the number of fibers required per typed sample by dividing the final sample volume required (µL) by the sample volume per fiber type-specific sample (e.g., 72 µL ÷ 9 µL = 8 fibers per fiber type-specific sample). For this to be achieved, collect a total of 50 fibers.\n\t\tNOTE: The sample volume required is the minimum protein concentration required to run both MyDoBID and western blotting if the amount of protein loaded is equivalent to a ~3 mm fiber (~12 µg of wet weight) for each sample (see Supplementary File 1 for details). However, this volume does not factor in whether repeat gels are required for a given protein.  CAUTION: Forceps are sharp; handle them with care to avoid the risk of skin puncture.\nSingle-fiber isolation\n\t\nOn a small piece of paper 5 cm x 1 cm, use a ruler to draw a 1 cm line. Mark every 1 mm on that line.\nInsert this under the Petri dish lid as a guide to estimate the length of the fibers collected.",
    "Place the freeze-dried muscle sample under the stereomicroscope at low magnification (x 7.5). Use one pair of fine tissue dissecting forceps to hold the freeze-dried muscle in place and with the other start to separate small bundles of fibers (as seen in the video).\nIsolate one bundle of fibers and continue to tease apart until single fiber segments are isolated from the bundle.\nCollect a minimum of 50 fibers that are at least ~1 mm in length.\nMove the fiber to an empty space on the Petri dish. Inspect single-fiber segments under higher magnification (x 50). Ensure it is a single fiber by further separating the fiber at the end. If the fiber breaks instead of separating, it is a single fiber.\nDenaturation of fibers\n\t\nUsing forceps, gently collect the fiber and place it directly into the aliquoted denaturing buffer (do not let the forceps encounter the buffer).\nCheck the forceps under the microscope to ensure the fiber has been successfully removed. Close the tube and tap the bottom of the tube firmly on the bench three times to ensure that the fiber moves into the buffer.\nWipe the forceps clean using lint-free tissue before moving on to the next fiber. Repeat this process until all fibers are collected.\nVortex the fiber samples and briefly centrifuge for 5 s at 2,500 × g to draw the sample to the bottom of the tube.\n\t\tNOTE: The centrifugation duration (5 s) is timed from the start (0 × g) until the speed reaches ~2,500 × g.\nLeave the samples at room temperature for 1 h. Store at -80 °C for future use. Freeze and then thaw the samples before use.\n3. Dot blotting\nMembrane preparation and activation",
    "Measure, label, and cut to size one polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (0.2 µm pore size) to fit 50 samples (~10.5 cm x 5.5 cm).\nMark the left border numerically from top to bottom (1 to 10) and the top border alphabetically from left to right (A to E) spaced 1 cm apart.\nPrepare four sheets of filter paper with the dimensions of 12.5 cm x 7.5 cm.\nPile two sheets together to form a stack. Presoak the filter paper stack in 1x transfer buffer.\nPlace the membrane in a container. Pour 95% ethanol over the membrane, with enough volume to entirely immerse the membrane (10-15 mL). Agitate on the rocker for 1 min.\nRecollect the ethanol, immerse the membrane in 1x transfer buffer (~15 mL), and rock for a further 2 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Both ethanol and transfer buffer can be reused for future dot blotting experiments until sedimentation forms (change after six uses).\nLay the transfer buffer-soaked filter paper stack on a flat movable surface such as a large lid and flatten with the roller. Position the PVDF membrane on the stack using a gel releaser or tweezers.\nPlace a single sheet of dry filter paper on top of the membrane and move the roller over the filter paper to soak up any excess buffer on the membrane surface. Remove the top filter paper without rubbing the membrane.\n\t\tCAUTION: Methanol (Class 3, sub-risk 6.1) and ethanol (Class 3) are hazardous. Refer to the material safety datasheet (MSDS) for safe handling recommendations.\nSample absorption to the membrane\n\t\nThaw the fiber samples, perform a brief centrifuge (5 s) at room temperature as in step 2.3.4 and mix the sample thoroughly.",
    "Without touching the membrane with the pipette tip, slowly deposit a ~1 µL drop of each sample onto the membrane in the designated area. The dimensions of the designated area per fiber sample are ~1 cm x 1 cm. Aim to spot the sample in the center of this area.\nAllow the sample droplets to soak through the membrane for at least 15 min. Ensure no sample buffer remains and is completely absorbed.\nUsing plastic tweezers, carefully lift the membrane off the damp filter paper stack, place it on a single dry sheet of filter paper, and dehydrate the membrane for at least 5 min.\nOnce the sample spots turn completely white, reactivate the membrane.\nMembrane reactivation and block\n\t\nReactivate the membrane by repeating steps 3.1.5 and 3.1.6.\nPlace the membrane in wash buffer and rinse for 5 min with rocking. Discard the wash buffer.\nIncubate the membrane in blocking buffer for 30 min while rocking.\nRinse the membrane 3x with wash buffer until the buffer is no longer cloudy.\nLeave the membrane in the final wash on the rocker.\n4. Immunolabeling\nDetection of MHCIIa\n\t\nDilute the MHCIIa primary antibody at 1 in 200 in 10 mL of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) buffer.\nDiscard the wash buffer from the membrane and then pour the diluted MHCIIa antibody onto the membrane.\nPlace the container (with the membrane in MHCIIa) on the rocker at room temperature for 2 h or at 4 °C overnight.\nRecollect the MHCIIa antibody and store it at 4 °C. Wash the membrane with blocking buffer for 2 min on the rocker.\n\t\tNOTE: All primary antibodies can be reused up to five times as long as the buffer remains clear.\nRinse twice more; 5 min each time; three washes in total.",
    "Dilute mouse Immunoglobulin G Horseradish Peroxidase (IgG-HRP) secondary antibody at 1 in 20,000 in 10 mL of blocking buffer and add to the membrane.\nDiscard the wash buffer and incubate the membrane in mouse IgG-HRP secondary with rocking for 1 h.\nDiscard the secondary and wash the membrane in wash buffer (2, 5, 5 min).\nLeave the membrane soaking in the final wash until ready for imaging.\nTurn on the gel imager, wait 15 min for the imager to reach the required operating temperature, and then open the imaging software (see Table of Materials).\nIn the software window, click New Single Channel Protocol (Figure 3A). For a white light image of the membrane, under Applications | Blots | click Colorimetric (Figure 3B).\nClick on the gel area; each option is programmed for specific dimensions to fit the size of various gel types. Select the appropriate option to best fit the dimensions of the membrane (Figure 3C).\nPrepare the ECL by combining luminol and peroxidase reagents at a 1:1 ratio. Make a sufficient volume of ECL mixture to cover the entire membrane, typically a total volume of 800-1,000 µL is required.\nPlace the membrane on a large clear plastic tray and disperse the ECL mixture onto the membrane.\nPlace the membrane onto the imaging plate.\nClick on Position Gel (yellow button) for a live camera view. Click hold and drag the zoom button to maximize the imaging area of the membrane. At this point, straighten the position of the membrane if required. \nClick Run Protocol (green button) and wait for a colorimetric image of the membrane to be produced. Save this image to assist in matching the dots to the corresponding fiber sample.",
    "Without moving the membrane, change the application on the software by clicking the option for a 2 x 2 binning (Chemi High Resolution) (Figure 3D).\nUnder Image exposure and software, optimize the exposure time, click Faint Bands (Figure 3E) | Signal Accumulation Mode.\nUnder Setup, type in 1 s for the first image, 30 s for the last image, and 30 total images (Figure 3F).\nClick Run Protocol.\nSave an image at the following stages: before signal saturation (all visible dots are black), initial signal saturation (some dots begin to saturate), and oversaturated spots (all spots with strong signal detected are saturated).\nSave all required images before ending signal accumulation. Take the membrane out of the imager.\nUsing the gel releaser, place the membrane back into the container with the wash buffer.\nDetection of MHCI\n\t\nPour the wash buffer out and treat the membrane with stripping buffer for 30 min at 37 °C (ensure the membrane is completely immersed).\nRecollect the stripping buffer and rinse the membrane in wash buffer for 5 min with rocking.\n\t\tNOTE: Stripping buffer can be reused 10x before discarding.\nPour out the wash buffer and this time apply MHCI primary antibody diluted at a starting concentration of 1 in 200 (range: 1 in 200 to 1 in 500). Rock the membrane at room temperature for 1 h.\nAfter incubating in MHCI primary antibody, recollect the antibody and wash the membrane as in steps 4.1.4 and 4.1.5.\nDilute mouse IgM HRP secondary antibody in blocking buffer at 1 in 20,000. Pour out the blocking buffer from the membrane and incubate in the mouse IgM secondary as in step 4.1.7.\nWash and image capture detected MHCI as in steps 4.1.8 to 4.1.24.",
    "CAUTION: Stripping buffer contains Organo Phosphine 3-5% (Class 8). Refer to the MSDS for safe handling recommendations.\nDetection of potential MHCIIx using Actin\n\t\nStrip the membrane once more (steps 4.2.1 and 4.2.2).\nRepeat section 4.1, this time applying Actin primary antibody diluted at 1 in 500 in BSA buffer and then rabbit HRP secondary antibody diluted at 1 in 20,000 in blocking buffer.\n5. Fiber type identification\nMHCI, MHCIIa, and Actin signal analysis\n\t\nBecome familiar with the signal intensity panel (Figure 4A). Make a note of steps 5.1.2 to 5.1.4.\nA saturated signal intensity qualitatively indicates that the protein detection is strong.\nA moderate indicates that the target protein is present at a medium level.\nA faint signal indicates little target protein is present.\nUse the signal intensity panel to categorize fibers with 'saturated,' 'moderate,' or 'faint' signal intensity (Figure 4A).\nCarry out fiber type identification by comparing MHCIIa and MHCI results first (Figure 4B, left and middle blots).\nRecord fibers with saturated or moderate signal intensity of only one MHC isoform.\nIf the MHC isoform signal is 'faint,' leave the fiber unmarked (see Figure 4B).\nLastly, where Actin is observed (moderate or saturated signal intensity) in the fibers with no MHCI or IIa detected, record it as a potential type IIx fiber (Figure 4B, right blot).\nRecord fibers with faint MHC isoform signal but Actin detected (moderate or saturated intensity) as unidentified.\nDiscard samples with faint or no detection (no fiber collected) for all three target proteins (Figure 4C).\nRecord any fiber where both MHCI and MHCII signals are detected with a 'saturated' or moderate signal. These samples are not for use in fiber type-specific preparation.\nPreparation of fiber type-specific samples",
    "Prepare a separate type I and type II sample for each biopsy. For a type II sample, combine the minimum required number of fibers (calculated in step 2.1.5) in which MHCIIa is detected at saturated or moderate levels.\nIn a separate tube labeled as type I, repeat this process for fibers in which MHCI is detected (Figure 4D).\nUse fibers with moderate signal intensity if there are not enough fibers with saturated signals.\nCombine any potential IIx fibers.\nImmediately use fiber type-specific samples for western blotting or store them at -80 °C for future use.\n6. Western blot fiber type confirmation\nUtilize 10 µL of each fiber type-specific sample, (the minimum sample volume required, see step 2.1.5).\nSeparate samples using the specified precast gel via SDS-PAGE according to the manufacturer's protocol.\nUse a gel imager to detect the protein in the gel according to the manufacturer's protocol.\nPlace the gel into cold 1x transfer buffer for 10 min.\nWet transfer the proteins onto a 0.45 µm nitrocellulose membrane (9.5 cm x 13.5 cm) according to the manufacturer's protocol.\nAfter transfer, briefly rinse the membrane with ultrapure H2O in a container. Pour out the ultrapure water.\nAdd 10 mL of antibody signal enhancer solution to the membrane and rock at room temperature for 10 min.\nRecollect the antibody signal enhancer solution and wash 5x (5 s per wash) with ultrapure H2O.\n\tNOTE: Antibody signal enhancer solution can be used 5x before discarding.\nPour out the last wash, add blocking solution, and rock at room temperature for 1 h.\nUse a clean scalpel blade or scissors to cut horizontally across the membrane at a molecular weight that ensures that proteins that are 180 kDa and above are on the top section of the membrane.",
    "Use this top section for further fiber type confirmation.\nUse the portion below 180 kDa to detect different target proteins.\nOn the top section of the membrane, follow section 4.1 with MHCIIx primary and mouse Immunoglobulin M (IgM) HRP secondary antibody.\nStrip the membrane (as described in sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2) before repeating the process with MHCIIa IgG primary and mouse IgG HRP secondary antibody.\nStrip once more and finally apply MHCI IgM primary and mouse IgM HRP secondary antibody.\n\tNOTE: This step is qualitative and so any protein loss due to membrane stripping is not a concern.\nCompare the signal detected across the different MHC isoforms (as seen in Figure 5B). When the signal intensity is detected at moderate to saturated levels in the expected sample (MHCI - type I, MHCIIa - type II and MHCIIx - type IIx) the fiber type-specific samples will be recorded as reliable for use in future studies.\nRecord the sample as unreliable when more than one MHC isoform is equally detected in a sample.\n\tCAUTION: Antibody enhancer solution contains sodium hydroxide 50%.
