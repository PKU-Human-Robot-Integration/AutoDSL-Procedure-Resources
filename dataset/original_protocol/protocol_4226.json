    "Fix young panicles by immersing whole young panicles (from 4 cm to 15 cm in length) at proper developmental stages into about 100 ml freshly prepared Carnoy’s solution at room temperature for 2-4 h and store the fixative materials in Carnoy's solution at 4 °C.   Dissect about 15 florets under stereo microscope and remove all parts except anthers on a microscopic slide.   Put the anthers into 20 μl Aceto-carmine stain on a slide, and keep cutting the anthers with a small scalpel until no obvious large debris were observed.    Add 30 μl 60% (v/v) acetic acid to chopped anther on the slide and put the slide on a heating block at 50 °C for 2 min.   Cover the slide with a piece of glass cover slip and put the slide and cover slip under a piece of filter paper, then press the cover slip down tightly with thumb for 10 sec to squash the meiocytes. Keep the slide at -20 °C for at least 30 min (keep the glass slides from cracking when it was placed into liquid nitrogen next step).    Put the squashed slide into liquid nitrogen for 5 min and remove the cover slip with a scalpel.   Dehydrate the slides for 2 min in 40 ml of 70% ethanol, 90% ethanol and 100% ethanol, sequentially.    Add 15 μl VECTASHIELD Mounting Medium with DAPI on the air-dried slide, and seal the slide with a glass cover slip.   Observe the chromosome spreads under fluorescence microscope and capture the images with CCD camera (Figure 1)."
