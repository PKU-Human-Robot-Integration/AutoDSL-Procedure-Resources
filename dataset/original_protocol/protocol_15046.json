    "1. Course Construction\nInstall course floor. Course dimensions are 40 ft long by 7 ft wide consisting of 280 1 ft2 portable floor tiles (beige event floor tiles). Place with black trim around perimeter only (Figure 1).\nPaint the adjacent walls to match the floor tiles creating a somewhat monochromatic environment. Colors we used with greyscale values are provided (Table 5). If the specific colors are not available, we recommend taking a tile to a hardware store for color matching.\nInstall lighting according to the lighting template (Figure 1). Connect lights to dimmer switch.\nPaint obstacles according to painting instructions (Figure 2).\n2. Prepare Testing Area\nAdjust lighting to desired condition and check with light meter at the beginning, middle, and end of the hallway containing the course.\nMake sure that the video camera is set to record and that placement of the camera is appropriate to capture the subjects as they walk through the course. We recommend a ceiling mount or alternatively the camera can be hand held.\n3. Record Preferred Walking Speed PWS\nPosition subject in center of walkway (course column \"D\"). Note: toes should be behind border of walkway. Read instructions to the subject (Figure 3).\nBegin stopwatch once foot crosses black border and onto pathway. Stop time once foot crosses black border at other end of walkway. Record time as PWS1. Turn subject around and repeat procedure in opposite direction. Record time as PWS2. Average PWS1 and PWS2 and record as final PWS.\n4. Obstacle Course Navigation",
    "From the randomization scheme, set up the first course (Figure 4). Floor tiles should be used as the grid upon which the obstacles are mapped. Refer to the provided diagram for correct mapping of the obstacles. It is helpful to number the tiles along the vertical and horizontal axis with an indelible marker to permit easy placement of the obstacles. It is also helpful to label the obstacles according to the provided diagrams in an inconspicuous location.\nGuide subject to start of 40 ft walkway. Read instructions to the subject (Figure 3). Subject should be positioned in center of walkway (column \"D\") with toes behind border. Begin stopwatch once foot crosses black border and onto pathway. Stop time once foot crosses black border at other end of walkway. Record this time as Course Speed (CS).\nRecord when obstacles are hit, grading the severity of the hit on a 3 point scale. The course run should be videotaped for later confirmation by an independent observer.\n5. Obstacle Identification\nUpon completion of course navigation task, turn subject around to face the course and position at center of course (column D). Note: make sure that any obstacles that require repositioning in order to view correct color from end of course is rotated. Read instructions to subject (Figure 3). At this time the first object identification task will be administered. Ask the subject to turn around and tell the Research Assistant the total number of objects they can discern within 30 sec. This number should be recorded.",
    "Tell the subject to walk back through the course and point to each obstacle they can see. It does not matter if they collide with the obstacle. The number of obstacles they can see is recorded. It is helpful to record which obstacles they are able to detect. This is not timed.\nItems 4 and 5 should be repeated for each course version that is run.Subscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
