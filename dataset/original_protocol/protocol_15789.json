    "This protocol follows the animal care guidelines of UW-Madison.\n1. Generating adult Drosophila for PTBI\nFor the standard cross, place 20 virgin y[1] w[1];UAS-mCD8-GFP;; OK107-GAL417 adult females and 10 y[1] w[1]17 adult male flies together in vials (see Table of Materials) containing food. To have large numbers of synchronous offspring, set up 10-20 crosses at the same time. The standard cross gives rise to F1 progeny of the genotype: y[1] w[1];UAS-mCD8-GFP/+;; OK107-GAL4/+.\n\t\nPlace the vials at 25 °C for mating and egg-laying. To maximize progeny, transfer parents into new vials every 2-4 days, maintaining the earlier vials at 25 °C. Discard each vial 18 days after the parents were first placed in it to ensure that there is no F2 progeny.\n\t\tNOTE: 3 sets of offspring (\"broods\") can be generated from each set of parents.\nCheck after ~10 days, when the F1 progeny will begin to eclose.\nFor lineage studies, use F1 perma-twin males15 of genotype: w; FRT40A, UAS-CD2-RFP, UAS-GFP-Mir/FRT40A, UAS-CD8-GFP, UAS-CD2-Mir; tub-GAL80ts/act-GAL4 UAS-flp. For consistency, do this cross in the same direction each time.\n\t\nTo generate perma-twin males, place 20 virgin w; FRT40A, UAS-CD2-RFP, UAS-GFP-Mir; tub-GAL80ts/TM6B females and 10 w; FRT40A, UAS-CD8-GFP, UAS-CD2-Mir; act-GAL4 UAS-flp/TM6B15 adult males together in vials containing food.\nPlace the vials at 17 °C for mating and egg-laying. Transfer parents into vials of new food every 7 days, maintaining all vials at 17 °C. Discard each vial 35 days after the parents were first placed in it to ensure that there are no F2 progeny.\nCheck after ~21 days, when the F1 progeny will begin to eclose.\n2. Penetrating traumatic brain injury (PTBI;  Figure 1)\nSort newly eclosed F1 flies. Select young males within 6 h post-eclosion. Place these males in clean vials containing food, with 40 or fewer flies per vial.",
    "NOTE: This is most easily accomplished in mid-morning by anesthetizing flies on the CO2 pad and identifying adult males that still have meconium (visible as a dark greenish spot through the abdominal wall) in their guts.\nPre-feed with 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) (see Table of Materials) for 6 h before the injury if planning to label dividing cells with EdU. See step 3 for details.\nSanitize Minutien pins (see Table of Materials) for at least 5 min by placing ~100 pins in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube filled with 70% ethanol. \nSanitize the CO2 pad and a paintbrush by spraying 70% ethanol and wipe dry with a clean lint-free tissue. Once the tools are clean and dry, transfer 40 or fewer sorted F1 males back onto the clean pad.\nSeparate the F1 males into 2 groups on the fly pad. One group will serve as a control, uninjured flies. The second experimental group will be subjected to PTBI.\nUsing forceps, pull 4-5 new Minutien pins out of the microcentrifuge tube and place them near the edge of the CO2 pad. Under the dissecting scope, choose a straight Minutien pin with a sharp point.\n\tNOTE: Using a single Minutien pin for an experiment will reduce variability. Reuse sharp pins. Place damaged or blunt pins in a separate 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing 70% ethanol for safe disposal.\nIf working with flies from the standard cross, switch on the stereo microscope light-emitting diode (LED) lamp equipped with the appropriate excitation and emission filters for green fluorescence protein (GFP). This permits excitation at 440-460 nM and allows visualization of 500-560 nM.",
    "NOTE: With this lamp and filter set, the cell bodies of the mushroom body will fluoresce green through the head cuticle (Figure 1C). For perma-twin flies or flies of other genotypes, a standard white light illuminator for the stereo microscope can be used to visualize landmarks on the head cuticle for targeting the injury to the mushroom body (Figure 1C).\nUse the forceps to pick up and hold the selected Minutien pin in one hand (for right-handed people, this is usually the right hand) and the paintbrush in the other (usually left) hand. Choose a fly from the experimental group and position the fly such that you have a dorsal view of the head capsule with the fly's head to the right. Place the brush on the anterior of the dorsal thorax and push down gently to stabilize the fly.\nAim the Minutien pin's tip at the mushroom body's cell bodies on the right side of the head and penetrate the head capsule. If using landmarks, target the dorsal head cuticle between the ocelli and the dorsal rim of the eye (Figure 1).\nAfter completing the injury, use the paintbrush to push the head gently off the Minutien pin.\nIf using the brain for RNA-Seq or qRT-PCR, make a second injury on the left side of the head.\nRepeat steps 2.8-2.10 to injure all of the flies in the experimental group.\nOnce all flies have been injured, place the control and injured flies into labeled, separate vials containing food. Lay the vials horizontally (i.e., on their sides) while the flies recover from the anesthesia and during subsequent aging to prevent flies from getting caught in the food.\nPlace standard cross flies at 25 °C, and perma-twin flies at 30 °C to age.",
    "For flies aged longer than 24 h, place them on clean food every 1-2 days.\n3. EdU labeling\nPrepare a stock of 10 mM 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). This can be stored at -20 °C for up to 12 months.\nPrepare 200 µL of 50 µM EdU in 10% sucrose. Pre-feed flies with EdU for 6 h before PTBI.\nPlace 200 µL of 50 µM EdU in 10% sucrose on a 23 mm round grade 3 filter paper (see Table of Materials) in an otherwise empty vial.\nPlace the flies in the vial. Then seal the vial with a cotton plug.\nLay the vial horizontally in a humidified incubator at 25 °C for 6 h.\nCarry out PTBI as described in steps 2.3-2.10.\nPlace the flies back in the EdU-containing vial. Seal the vial with a cotton plug.\nLay the vial horizontally in a humidified incubator at 25 °C for up to 24 h. Follow one of the steps described below (step 3.8.1-3.8.3).\n\t\nDissect and fix brains as described in step 4 using fixative, wash buffer, and blocking buffer without azide and with the EdU detection reaction carried out before antibody staining.\nTransfer the flies to a clean vial containing a new filter paper and 200 µL of 50 µM EdU in 10% sucrose. Lay the vial horizontally in a 25 °C incubator. Repeat every 24 h during the duration of the labeling. Then, dissect and fix brains as described in step 4 using buffers without azide with the EdU detection reaction carried out before antibody staining.",
    "To pulse-chase label with EdU, feed EdU for the pulse period, transfer the flies every 24 h to a clean vial containing a new filter paper and 200 µL of 50 µM in 10% sucrose. After the pulse period (e.g., 4 days), transfer the flies to a vial containing standard Drosophila food. Place the vial on its side in a 25 °C incubator for an additional 3 days. Then, dissect and fix brains as described in step 4 using buffers without azide with the EdU detection reaction carried out before antibody staining.\n4. Dissection, immunohistochemistry, and mounting\nPrepare 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes with 100 µL of fixative: 4% formaldehyde in PEM (100 mM piperazine-N,N'-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) [PIPES], 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgSO4, pH 7.0) (see Table of Materials) and place on ice.\n\tNOTE: As many as 20 brains of a single genotype and condition can be processed in a single tube.\nPrepare a dissection plate with one small pool (~100 µL) of 70% ethanol and three small pools of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 100 mM of K2HPO4, 140 mM of NaCl, pH 7.0).\nAnesthetize ~10 control or experimental flies on a CO2 pad that has been sanitized with 70% ethanol.\nSeparate the head from the trunk of each fly using a scalpel.\nCollect the heads with a paintbrush wetted in 70% ethanol and place heads for 2-5 min in the ethanol pool on the dissection plate.\n\tNOTE: This slightly dehydrates the brains and makes them easier to dissect away from the head cuticle.",
    "Transfer the heads to a ~100 µL pool of PBS and dissect out the brains, moving each brain to a clean ~100 µL pool of PBS. Perform this using two pairs of Watchmakers forceps to open the back of the head cuticle and holding the cuticle with one pair of forceps while gently prying the brain out of the cuticle using the closed tip of the second pair of forceps.\nTransfer the dissected brains to a microcentrifuge tube containing 100 µL of the fixing solution using a P200 pipettor equipped with a plastic tip that has been cut and beveled to permit entry of the brains.\nFix for 20-25 min at room temperature. Carefully remove the fix with either a P200 or a glass pipette.\nWash the fixed brains four times with 1 mL of 'PT' (PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100), allowing the brains to settle for several minutes between each wash.\n\tNOTE: If brains do not settle rapidly between the washes, they are likely to have still fat body and/or trachea attached.\nBlock samples in 1 mL of PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2% bovine serum albumin (PBT) for ~1 h at room temperature.\nRemove the blocking solution and incubate samples with 100 µL of primary antibody solution overnight at 4 °C in PBT. The primary antibodies used in this study are rabbit anti-PH3 (1:500) and mouse anti-Fasiclin II (1:20) (see Table of Materials).\nWash samples five times with 1 mL of PT, allowing the brains to settle for several minutes between each wash.\nRemove the final wash and incubate in 100 µL of secondary antibody solution overnight at 4 °C. The secondary antibodies used here are anti-rabbit 568 (1:400) and anti-mouse Cy5 (1:100) (see Table of Materials).",
    "Wash samples five times with 1 mL of PT, allowing the brains to settle for several minutes between each wash. During the final wash, add 4',6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindole, Dihydrochloride (DAPI; 1:100 of a 10 µM solution) for 10 min to stain the nuclei. Remove the wash, leaving 50-100 µL in each tube.\nPrepare microscope slides by placing a single, self-adhesive reinforcement label on the middle of each slide and a 50 µL droplet of anti-fade mounting media in the center of each label (see Table of Materials). The reinforcement label holds the coverslip slightly above the slides and prevents the mounted brains from becoming overly flattened.\nCarefully transfer the brains from each microcentrifuge tube to a prepared slide with as little wash buffer as possible using a P200 equipped with a cut and beveled plastic tip. As many as 10 brains can be mounted on a single slide.\nUse forceps to gently reposition the brains before placing a coverslip on each slide and sealing the slide with nail polish. Orient the brains with either posterior side up or anterior side up but should not be touching one another.\n\tNOTE: Because it is difficult to obtain high-quality confocal images through an entire brain, some brains should be mounted in each orientation.\nStore prepared slides flat and in the dark at 4 °C until imaging. For longer-term storage (up to 1 year), slides may be stored at -20 °C.\n5. Confocal imaging\nNOTE: Image brains using a laser-scanning confocal microscope with excitation lasers and emission filter cubes appropriate to DAPI and the fluorescent secondary antibodies (i.e., 405 nm, 488 nm, and 568 nm, 633 nm, respectively).\nTurn on the power of the microscope, lasers, controller, and computer.\nOpen the Acquisition software.",
    "In the Acquisition mode, select up to four channels and set the parameter for sequential scanning of the desired channels. Increase the laser power for each channel to 5-10%.\nPlace a slide on the microscope.\nChoose a brain to be imaged using the epifluorescence attachment (see Table of Materials).\nIn the Acquisition mode, select 1024 x 1024 pixels as the frame dimension.\nIn the Acquisition mode, select the Z-stack option, indicate Z-stack should be taken at 2 µm sections, and focus through the sample, selecting the top and bottom focal planes to be imaged.\nCollect Z-stack images of entire brains using a 20x objective and specific brain regions such as the mushroom body using a 60x objective.\n6. Data analysis\nQuantify the proliferating cells and the numbers of perma-twin clones manually and/or using the image analysis software (see Table of Materials). When using software, select regions of interest (ROIs) with areas of at least 10 µm."
