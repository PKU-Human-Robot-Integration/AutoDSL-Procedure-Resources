  "title": "Elastic Staining on Paraffin-embedded Slides of pT3N0M0 Gastric Cancer Tissue",
  "procedures": [
    "Between 1994 and 2005, patient samples were selected by two experienced gastrointestinal pathologists in the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University, from patients who suffered gastrectomy of stomach neoplasms, with a postoperative pathological diagnosis of gastric cancer at the pT3N0M0 stage (according to the seventh TNM staging). This study was approved by the ethics review committee.\n1. Sectioning\nPlace the paraffin block into a fixed holder of the sledge microtome, which can move backward and forward across the blade. Adjust the optimal angle between the block and the microtome knife.\n\tNOTE: The optimal angle not only depends on the blade's geometry but also on the cutting speed and technique.\nTrim the paraffin block as necessary and cut it into 5-µm-thick cross sections.\nPlace the paraffin 5-µm sections in a water bath at about 40 - 45 °C and mount it, subsequently, from the water onto the glass slide, one section per slide.\nPress the mounted section carefully against a paper towel to remove any residual water and potential air bubbles.\nAllow sections to air-dry for 30 min and then bake them in an oven at 45 - 50 °C for 2 h.\n2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration of All Slides\nImmerse the slides in xylene in a Coplin jar for 10 min.\nTake the slides out from the first xylene jar and immerse them in xylene in another jar for 10 min.\nNow, immerse the slides in 100% ethanol in a Coplin jar for 5 min.\nImmerse the slides in 100% ethanol in another Coplin jar, also for 5 min.\nImmerse the slides in 95% ethanol in a Coplin jar for 2 min.\nImmerse the slides in 70% ethanol in a Coplin jar for 2 min.",
    "NOTE: Ensure that the slides are completely immersed in the solutions while performing the above steps.\nRinse the slides briefly with distilled water in a new jar.\n3. Staining\nBefore proceeding for staining, wipe off any excess solutions around the tissue on the slide with a tissue paper.\nPlace the slides inroom temperature and room humidity conditions to avoid drying of the tissue on the slide throughout the entire staining process.\nOxidize the slides with a few drops of potassium permanganate for 5 min. Ensure that the volume of potassium permanganate is enough to cover the tissue section on each slide.\nRinse the oxidized slides with distilled water in a Coplin jar with 2 - 3 changes. Observe the blue color of the tissue.\nNow, bleach these slides by adding a few drops of oxalic acid for 5 min. Ensure that the volume of oxalic acid is enough to completely cover the tissue section on each slide.\nRinse the slides by immersing them in the Coplin jar filled with distilled water. Perform the rinse 2x - 3x.\nNow, wash these slides briefly in 95% alcohol, and then immerse the slides into an elastin solution (5 g/L) for 8 - 24 h.\n\tNOTE: Elastin solution is volatile, and its staining time is relatively long, so it is best to immerse the slides with elastic staining in a sealed container, such as a transparent glass bottle with a sealing cap. The capacity of the container and the volume of the elastin solution depends on the number of immersed slides, as long as it enables the complete immersion of all the slides.\nImmerse these slides directly in 95% ethanol for 1 - 2 min to differentiate each tissue section well.",
    "NOTE: Differentiation refers to the change in the charge of the tissue section, which removes the excess staining absorbed by the tissue and makes the colors clearer. After elastin solution staining, samples should not be washed with distilled water to avoid any difficulty in differentiation. Check microscopically, as necessary, for blue-black elastic fibers staining and gray background. It is better to slightly underdifferentiate the tissue since the subsequent Van Gieson's counterstain can also somewhat extract the elastic stain.\nFully rinse these slides with distilled water after differentiation.\nCounterstain the slides in a Van Gieson's solution for 1 min.\n\tNOTE: The volume of the Van Gieson's solution needs to be enough to be able to immerse the tissue section on each slide completely.\nRapidly drop 95% ethanol onto these slices for a few seconds to differentiate each tissue section well.\n\tNOTE: Do not rinse the slides with any water after the Van Gieson's counterstaining, as that could weaken or even elute the color of the Van Gieson's counterstaining.\n4. Dehydration and Mounting\nImmerse the slides in 95% alcohol for 5 min to let them dehydrate quickly.\nContinue to dehydrate these slices by 2 changes of 100% alcohol, each time immersing the slides for 5 min.\nImmerse the slides into 2 changes of xylene, each time for 3 min.\nAdd one drop of resinous mounting medium to the slide and place the coverslip on the top.\n5. Microscopic Observation of the Slides\nFind the serosal direction and observe the results of elastic staining: elastic fibers (lamina) are stained blue-black, collagen fibers are stained red, and muscle fibers are stained yellow.\nLook for the cancer cells in the whole slide: cancer cells are stained yellow12.\nDetermine the positional relationship between the cancer cells and elastic lamina.",
    "NOTE: There will be two situations here. As long as there is one tumor cell that has invaded beyond the elastic lamina in the whole slide, then this case could be considered as elastic lamina invasion. On the other hand, only when there is no tumor cell that has invaded beyond the elastic lamina in the whole slide, this case could be considered as elastic lamina non-invasion.\nSubscription Required.
