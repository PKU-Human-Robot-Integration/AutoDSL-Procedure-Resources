    "The surgical method described in this paper has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, and the use of patient surgical videos has been authorized. Informed consent was obtained from the patients, and patient data was used for presentation.\n1. Instruments for operation\nEnsure that the display camera system and holmium laser are working properly.\n2. Preparation for operation\nUse the following inclusion criteria to select participants for this study.\n\t\nAll patients who had been diagnosed with azoospermia or oligospermia and had consented to surgery.\nSemen volume less than 1.5 mL, pH<7.2. Seminal plasma fructose ≤13 µM/single ejaculation.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed cysts in the ejaculatory duct area and enlarged bilateral seminal vesicle glands (Figure 1).\n\t\tNOTE: It is difficult to identify prostate cysts and ejaculatory duct cysts through imaging accurately. We usually confirm the diagnosis through surgery when seminal vesicle dilatation has a width greater than 17 mm10.\nSex hormone levels are within the normal range. The testicular volume was more than 15 mL (individual testicular volume).\n\t\tNOTE: The purpose of testicular volume >15 mL is to rule out azoospermia caused by some testicular factors. Testicular volume was measured using ultrasound report data and Lambert's formula: L x W x H x 0.71.\nThere were no diseases that affected the safety of surgery, such as poorly controlled hypertension and hyperglycemia, respiratory diseases, etc.\nUse the following exclusion criteria to exclude participants from this study.\n\t\nPatients with urethral stricture, acute urinary tract infection, severe coagulopathy, or other contraindications to anesthesia.\nThe testicular volume was less than 12 mL.\nAdminister intravenous antibiotics 30 min before surgery to prevent infection. Typically, use 1.5 g cefuroxime sodium with 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution.\n3. Operational procedure",
    "Position the patient in lithotomy for anesthesia induction using sufentanil (0.3 µg/kg), propofol (2 mg/kg), and rocuronium bromide (0.8 mg/kg). Perform tracheal intubation once drugs take effect, connecting to the anesthesia machine for mechanical ventilation.\nMaintain with propofol (2 mg/kg/h), remifentanil (0.15 µg/kg/min), and 2% sevoflurane to achieve a BIS value of 40-60. Inject rocuronium bromide intermittently for inotropic relaxation. Disinfect the lower abdomen and perineal area 3x with iodophor.\nConnect the seminal vesiculoscope to the display system. Insert the endoscope through the external urethral opening and carefully advance it toward the posterior urethra. The urethral mucosa appears smooth and reddish, confirming the accurate positioning of the urethra within the visual field and extending towards the posterior urethra.\nIf successful, check that the raised structure of the urethra, known as the colliculus seminalis, is visible.On either side of the colliculus seminalis, check for two small openings of the ejaculatory ducts (Figure 2A).\nGuide a wire (Bard) through the affected side's ejaculatory duct opening, entering the ejaculatory duct cyst. Observe a significant area filled with cloudy fluid during the procedure (Figure 2B).\nFlush the cyst with saline until achieving clear vision, examining for abnormal openings in the seminal canal. Enter the ipsilateral seminal vesicle through the abnormal ejaculatory duct cyst opening, revealing multiple honeycombed ductal lumens (Figure 2C).\nUsing a 40 W holmium laser, expand the diameter of the ejaculatory tube to approximately 5 mm, facilitating improved circulation of the flush fluid and providing a clearer view (Figure 2D).\nCut the ejaculatory duct opening along the direction of urine flow, which may be conducive to preserving the anti-urine reflux mechanism.\nIdentify and explore the symmetrical position of the abnormal ejaculatory duct opening on the affected side.",
    "Enter the seminal vesicle of the healthy side for further exploration.Gently insert it into the seminal vesicle at the lower left and right of the cysts. It is important to note that the exact location may vary (Figure 2E).\nUse the holmium laser to precisely incise and widen the contralateral artificial opening, allowing smooth passage for the endoscope. This marks the pivotal endpoint of the operation, where sperm in the vas deferens on both sides is effectively released through the opening of the ejaculatory duct on the affected side (Figure 2F).\nIndwell a Fr18 catheter and rinse continuously with physiological sodium chloride to prevent blood clots from blocking the catheter.\n4. Postoperative care\nOn the 1st day post-surgery, continuously irrigate the bladder for 6 h and supplement with glucose and electrolytes as needed.\nRemove the catheter on the 2nd day post-surgery. Ensure that the patient experiences no evident pain after surgery; instead, they are able to endure the primary discomfort from the catheter, which is manageable without medication. Do not administer antibiotics postoperatively to patients without pre-existing infections. Keep the hospital stay for 2 days.\nInstruct the patients to increase water intake, urinate frequently, and ejaculate as soon as possible after discharge, aiming for 1-2 times per week. Additionally, closely observe the semen volume.\n5. Follow up\nPerform semen analysis in the 3rd month after surgery to ensure that the gag time requirement was met, and follow up after 3 months mainly through telephone interviews.\nPerform semen samples using the automatic sperm motility testing instrument and the automatic seminal plasma biochemical instrument. Compare the semen analysis results obtained before the surgery with those at the 3rd month post-surgery.\n6. Statistical analysis",
    "Analyze the results using GraphPad software and expressed as mean ± SD. Normality tests were performed using Shapiro-Wilk tests.If the preoperative and postoperative differences are normally distributed, analyze using the paired t-test; otherwise, use non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney). Analyze differences between preoperative and postoperative data by paired t-test. Statistical differences were regarded as significant when P <0.05.\nSubscription Required.
