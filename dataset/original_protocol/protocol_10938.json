    "All data collection in the original experiment15 was performed in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the American Psychological Association as well as the World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki. The experiment was preapproved by the local Ethik-Kommission (equivalent to an Institutional Review Board). All subjects were made aware that their participation was voluntary and could at any time and without fear of penalty be terminated. All subjects signed informed consent.\n1. Participant Recruitment and Pre-study Instructions\nRecruitment:\nRecruit participants who are native speakers (to ensure a comparable understanding of the instructions and comparable processing of target information) and who have normal or corrected to normal vision. Also, either a) exclude subjects who profess below average olfactory abilities or are smokers, or b) collect information about smoking habits and olfactory ability to use in later analyses.\nFurthermore, given the frequency of sex differences found in olfactory studies18, either a) recruit equal numbers of males and females, to allow for comparisons, b) perform analyses separately for each sex to ensure no differences, or c) focus on a single sex. Finally, given that olfactory performance is age dependent19 either a) recruit all subjects from a single cohort, or b) specifically include age as a variable of interest.\n\t\tNote: The final sample used in the current study included 60 subjects (56 females, Mage = 22.05 years, SD = 4.86), all of whom were students at the University of Hildesheim and who participated in exchange for partial course credit. Further information concerning the sample can be found in our previous article15.\nProvide subjects with specific pre-study instructions. 1) Subjects must not smoke for the 24 h prior to the beginning of the experiment, 2) Subjects must not eat or brush teeth for at least one hour prior to the beginning of the experiment.",
    "When subjects arrive in the laboratory ensure that they have followed the pre-study instructions. This is best accomplished by having the experiment leader specifically ask the subjects whether they have complied with the instructions.\nIf they have complied, present subjects with information about the study and any ethical considerations. Have subjects sign informed consent.\nSituate subjects in the experimental room.\n\tNOTE: In the current experiment subjects were first placed in a cabin in which there was a monitor rested upon a table.\n\t\nSeat subjects in a comfortable chair which they can adjust as needed. Have subjects place their chins in a chin rest (in which the tubes for presenting the odors are located). Adjust the height of the chin rest to make the seating comfortable for the subject.\nAlternatively, use another method of presentation, including placing the tubes directly in the nostrils of the subjects or connecting the tube-ends to a mask, which ensures that the odorous material remains concentrated around the nose.\n2. Experimental Design\nNOTE: In the experiment outlined here (which corresponds to Experiment 1 from the original article15) the purpose was to determine whether the presence of an odor context during encoding and retrieval enhanced memory over a condition in which no extra odor context was present during both phases5. This is a variety of a CDM effect called context enhanced memory. The original experiment included more independent variables (odor valence and word valence) that are irrelevant for the current report. For details on the original experiment and specific information concerning the verbal material used, see the Supplementary Material from the original article15. The experiment is broken down into three different phases (See Table 1 for an overview).\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nPre-study,Encoding phase,Retention interval,Retrieval phase",
    "1. Ensure pre-study instructions were follwed,1. Present words one at a time,1. 5 minute break in which subjects color in mandalas,1. Present words one at a time\n2. Have subjects sign informed-concsent,2. Subjects complete abstract/concrete categorization task,,2. Subjects complete old/new recognition test\n3. Situate subjects in experimental room,3. Present odorants on each trial,,3. Present odorants on each trial\n4. Perform practice inhalation trials,,,\nTable 1: Overview of the experimental procedure.\nFor the first, encoding, phase have subjects encode the target material (words) in the presence of the contextual material (odors).\nPresent subjects with words (one at a time) on the screen. Subjects must categorize the words as abstract or concrete. Learning is incidental, as subjects are not informed of the later memory test.\nHave subjects categorize 90 words in total.\nHave each trial follow the same pattern.\n\t\t\nBegin each trial with the presentation of a puff of air. The puff of air either contains odorous material or not, depending on the group.\nCouple the puff of air the presentation of a cross on the computer screen and have the puff of air and the cross remain for 2,000 ms.\nReplace the cross is replaced with a target word, and have it remain for 2,000 ms. Order word presentation randomly for each subject.\nUpon offset of the word, have subjects categorize the word as abstract or concrete by button press. The response triggers the immediate onset of the next trial. Present the same odorant on all 90 trials during the encoding phase.\nOdor presentation.\n\t\t\nUtilize an olfactometer to achieve direct presentation of odorants. Olfactometers come in several different varieties. Purchase or build an olfactometer that will best meet the aims of the researchers25.\nEnsure that the olfactometer design is appropriate to the research question.",
    "Cut the tubes to the appropriate length and ensure that they are held in place and tightly connected.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The length of the tubes influences the delay between signal onset (i.e., signal from program to release an odorant) and actual arrival of odorous material to the nostrils. Researchers should be aware of the delays between signals and actual presentation times, which will vary between individual olfactometers. This information can usually be found in information provided by the retailer or in instructions for building new olfactometers.\nBe aware of potential issues involved with odorant presentation.\n\t\t\t\nEnsure that the inter-stimulus interval (ISI; or the length of time between odorant presentations) is appropriate for the research question. There is no standardized or suggested ISI appropriate for all odor experiments. Conduct pilot tests to determine which ISI’s are appropriate for the experiment in question.\nControl for tactile stimulation. Present the tubes inside a metal bar that supports the chin rest. Have the tubes end approximately 2 cm below the nostrils. Cover the top of the metal bar with a filter (e.g., tissue). Replace the filter for each subject.\nControl for auditory stimulation. Have subjects perform the experiment inside a sound-reducing cabin with headphones on. Store the olfactometer itself in a sound-reducing container unit stored outside of the experimental cabin.\nFor presentation control, use a standard experimental control software program (see Table of Materials) to control odorant presentation from the olfactometer.\nBreathing instructions.\n\t\tNOTE: When using an olfactometer, it is potentially important that subjects sniff (i.e., sample the olfactory material) at the appropriate moment. This is particularly important in experiments where the odorant changes between trials.",
    "To ensure that subjects sample the odorant at the appropriate time, present a visual cue (fixation cross) simultaneously with the onset of the puff of air. Furthermore, ensure that the puff of air is long enough to allow the subjects to register the visual cue and initiate inhalation (2,000 ms). It should be noted here that the inhalation instruction might act as a second task, which could potentially interact with the task(s) of interest.\nAlternatively, use one of several other methods for ensuring subjects sample the odorants at the appropriate time:\n\t\t\t\nPresent subjects with a countdown, so they can prepare to inhale when the countdown is completed\nPresent subjects with an initial cue alerting them to exhale followed by a second cue alerting them to inhale\nIf the tubes are presented directly in the nostrils, and a discrete presentation olfactometer is used, instruct subjects to inhale anytime they feel tactile stimulation inside the nostrils.\nRegardless of which method is used, have subjects complete inhalation practice trials before beginning with the actual experiment.\nFor practice trials, instruct subjects to inhale whenever they see the appearance of the fixation cross. Present a fixation cross and an air puff for 2,000 ms on each trial. Have subjects complete 10 practice trials.\nTiming.\n\t\t\nPresent the odorous material two seconds prior to the onset of the visually presented word. This is done to ensure that the olfactory context is present during visual perception.",
    "Other research questions may call for simultaneous perception. Olfactory perception takes longer than visual and auditory perception from the time of stimulus onset until perception20, at least as measured by response times on detection tasks21. Therefore, depending on the manipulation, researchers must ensure that they choose appropriate inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs). Note that this will also depend on the specifics of the olfactometer used (see 4.1.)\nFor the second phase, use a retention interval in which subjects complete a task that is unrelated to the actual memory task.\nHave subjects leave the testing cabin and move to a different area, away from odorous material. This is an important step to ensure that the context is reinstated during the retrieval phase.\nAir out the testing cabin during the retention interval with ventilators or fans.\nHave subjects color in mandalas for 5 minutes.\n\t\tNOTE: OCDM experiments have frequently, though not always14, utilized long retention intervals to avoid issues of adaptation and habituation. One potential benefit of direct presentation of discrete air puffs is that it may be more resistant to habituation than ambient presentation.\nAlternative distractor tasks can be implemented in the retention interval to accomplish different goals.\nFor the third, retrieval phase, have subjects remember and retrieve the target information.\nHave subjects return to the experimental cabin. Once again, seat subjects with their chins in the chin rest.\nHave subjects complete an old/new recognition test with a total of 180 trials (90 old/90 new).\nHave each trial follow the same pattern.\n\t\t\nBegin each trial with the presentation of a puff of air. The puff of air either contains odorous material or not, depending on the group. As this is a context enhancement experiment, the odorant presented is always the same as that presented in the encoding phase.",
    "Couple the puff of air with the presentation of a cross on the computer screen; have both the puff of air and the cross remain for 2,000 ms.\nReplace the cross with a word and have the subject respond (by button press) as to whether the word is old or new. The word remains until the subject responds. The order of word presentation is determined randomly for each subject.\nHave the subject’s response trigger the immediate onset of the next trial. There are no time limits during the retrieval phase.\n3. Stimulus Selection\nTarget stimuli\nSelect target stimuli that best fit the exact research question or the type of memory test that the experimenter is planning. For the most basic design, choose stimuli that come from a non-olfactory modality (e.g., words). For more information about the target stimuli used in the experiment reported here see the original article15.\nContextual stimuli\nSelect odorants that best fit the exact research question. Important attributes to take into account include 1) valence, 2) arousal, 3) intensity, 4) familiarity, and 5) identifiability.\nThere are several methods that can be used when choosing the appropriate odorants.\n\t\t\nIn one method, choose the odorants based on a pilot study. In this case, have external subjects (those not participating in the main experiment) rate a variety of potential odorants on various attributes. Based on the results, choose the odorants that best suit the needs of the experimental question. This was the method used in the original experiment using direct presentation and OCDM (see original article for details on chosen odorants)15.\nAlternatively, the choose the odorants based on a pre-existing database containing ratings22. Exercise caution with this method due to large potential cultural differences in odor perception23.\nLastly, in certain cases, choose stimuli based on the subject’s idiosyncratic odor ratings24.",
    "Choose the odorous material that is best suited for the olfactometer being used.\n\t\t\nDecide on liquid or solid material—some olfactometers only allow for the use of liquid material, while others allow for the use of either liquid or solid material.\nObtain odorous material from a commercial supplier, either from companies that specifically produce odorants and chemicals for research purposes, or from companies that produce products (e.g., essential oils, perfumes, scented candles, etc.) for use by the general public.\nAlternatively, olfactometer permitting, collect odorous material from surrounding sources (e.g., pine needles, sweaty t-shirts, fruits, etc.). This method may be appropriate for some research questions; exercise caution as it makes standardization (and therefore comparisons with other research projects) difficult.\nSubscription Required.
