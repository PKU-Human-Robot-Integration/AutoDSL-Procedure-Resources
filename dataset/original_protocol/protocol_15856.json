    "UniLectin3D is a curated database that classifies and describes 3D structures of lectins by origin and fold, with cross-links to literature and other databases in glycoscience. Among the 2330 entries (sept 2021), more than 60% are complexes between a protein and a carbohydrate ligand, bringing invaluable information on the molecular basis of specificity and affinity. Many lectins recognize glycans present on human tissues, playing a role in cancer, development, immunity, and infection. Structural variations of some of these glycans differentiate individuals, defining for example the basis of the ABO human blood group system (Marionneau et al., 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.305#cpz1305-bib-0025]). Some pathogens, such as Vibrio cholerae or noroviruses, infect sub-populations with given blood group phenotypes more efficiently, and the lectins involved in their recognition have been well studied (Heggelund, Varrot, Imberty, & Krengel, 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.305#cpz1305-bib-0017]). This protocol, using bacterial lectins binding the blood group O oligosaccharide (also called the H epitope) as an example, will demonstrate the search function of UniLectin3D for the analysis of the structural details of this interaction.\nNecessary Resources\nHardware\nComputer with internet connection\nSoftware\nUp-to-date web browser such as Chrome or Firefox. Using Safari or Edge may not be as reliable.\nAccess to UniLectin3D and search interface\n1. Go to the UniLectin platform webpage: https://www.unilectin.eu/[href=https://www.unilectin.eu/].\n2. Select the UniLectin3D module by clicking on the corresponding blue button on the homepage. This action opens https://www.unilectin.eu/unilectin3D/[href=https://www.unilectin.eu/unilectin3D/]. The UniLectin3D landing page, shown in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.305#cpz1305-fig-0002], offers different search modes (keywords, fields, or glycan ligands). It also displays visual summaries of the module content in the form of sunbursts enabling data browsing. Finally, it shows a hierarchical chart that can be expanded to detail the underlying lectin classification built on folds branching to classes branching to families. In all cases, these charts are interactive and open new windows for accessing the lectin pages.",

Oligosaccharide structures can be searched through the “Glycan Search” option of the UniLectin3D interface. Clicking on this button opens https://www.unilectin.eu/unilectin3D/glycan_search[href=https://www.unilectin.eu/unilectin3D/glycan_search] and displays the table of monosaccharides shown in Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.305#cpz1305-fig-0003].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/68ca2538-fadc-4c0a-928a-3587e97219c0/cpz1305-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nRepresentation of the two types of blood group O(H) antigens. From top: IUPAC condensed representation, schematic chemical drawing, corresponding ChEBI accession numbers, and SNFG representation. SNFG details: red triangle: fucose; yellow disk: galactose; and blue square: N-acetyl-glucosamine. Carbons are numbered from 1 to 6 to specify the linkages between monosaccharides.\n4. To select the O(H) blood group antigen, the user needs to know it is a trisaccharide composed of one fucose (L-Fucp), one galactose (D-Galp), and one N-acetylglucosamine (D-GlcNAcp). Two types of this molecule are known, corresponding to a subtle difference in the linkage between the galactose and the N-acetylglucosamine. These are described by IUPAC sequences along with the matching 2D structures recorded in ChEBI and in the SNFG symbolic notation in Figure 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.305#cpz1305-fig-0004]. With this information, it is then possible to click on either of the three monosaccharides that are part of the blood group O(H) epitope or to simultaneously select the three of them, as displayed in Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.305#cpz1305-fig-0003] (green boxes). This results in outputting all oligosaccharides containing these three monosaccharides and present in binding sites of lectin structures in UniLectin3D.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/adda3694-8cb3-4857-84f9-1100e4c2d451/cpz1305-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4",

Successive mouse clicks on the three boxes (L-Fucp, D-Galp and D-GlcNAcp) turns their background from blue to green. Bottom: Excerpt of the output selection of 30 oligosaccharides matching the query. H-Type 1 (Fuc(a1-2)Gal(b1-3)GlcNAc) and H-Type 2 (Fuc(a1-2)Gal(b1-4)GlcNAc) are shown.\n5. Click on the Fuc(a1-2)Gal(b1-3)GlcNAc motif to display all lectins for which a three-dimensional structure is available in complex with this ligand or with a longer oligosaccharide comprising this epitope. The result by default shows lectins in all species, resulting in a total of 11 entries, two of bacterial and nine of viral origin, mainly noroviruses that attach to blood group O in intestine during infection. The query can be limited to bacteria only by selecting “Bacterial lectins” in the “Origin” box. This search results in two structures from two different species of Burkholderia, as represented in Figure 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.305#cpz1305-fig-0005]. These two lectins belong to different classes, one adopting a β-propeller fold (AAL-like class) and the other one a β-sandwich/TNF-like fold (TNFα-like fold). Both are opportunistic bacteria from the Burkholderia cepacia complex responsible for lung infection in immunocompromised or cystic fibrosis patients (Mahenthiralingam, Baldwin, & Dowson, 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.305#cpz1305-bib-0023]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d302547e-530b-4cd2-9be6-7da7b1b43f0f/cpz1305-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nResults of the search based on H-type 1 oligosaccharide in bacterial lectins.\nSearching UniLectin3D by field search query for H-type 2 epitope",
    "6. For more expert users mastering the IUPAC condensed representation of glycans, a shortcut is exemplified here using the H-type 2 oligosaccharide. In this case, the “Fuc(a1-2)Gal(b1-4)GlcNAc” motif is entered in the “IUPAC condensed” box of the “Search by field” menu and can be directly associated with “Bacterial lectins” in the “Origin” box. As shown in Figure 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.305#cpz1305-fig-0006], this results in two lectins from two different bacteria, i.e., Burkholderia ambifaria (as seen in step 4) and Photorhabdus asymbiotica, an insect pathogen also able to infect humans (Waterfield, Ciche, & Clarke, 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.305#cpz1305-bib-0034]). Both adopt a β-propeller fold, but they belong to different classes, i.e., AAL-like (6-bladed β-propeller) for BambL and PLL-like (7-bladed β-propeller) for PHL.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c49dee6a-552b-4893-ba27-e9ac72ea69bb/cpz1305-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\nResults of the search based on H-type 2 oligosaccharide in bacterial lectins.\nVisualization of the structural basis for blood group O recognition by bacterial lectins",
    "7. The previous search results show that the BambL lectin of Burkholderia ambifaria binds both H-type 1 and H-type 2 oligosaccharides. Detailed information on BambL lectin interacting with the Fuc(a1-2)Gal(b1-3)GlcNAc type 1 ligand can be obtained by clicking on the “View the 3D structure and information” button on the upper right corner of the listed item. This action will open https://unilectin.eu/unilectin3D/display_structure?pdb=3ZW2[href=https://unilectin.eu/unilectin3D/display_structure?pdb=3ZW2]. Information on BambL is accessible either by clicking on any green button that links to corresponding entries in UniProt (UniProt, 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.305#cpz1305-bib-0033]), PDB (European or American sites; Burley et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.305#cpz1305-bib-0009]), and GlyConnect (Alocci et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.305#cpz1305-bib-0002]), or by exploring the structural information displayed on the page with two different viewers. Litemol software (Sehnal et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.305#cpz1305-bib-0032]) is integrated to show the lectin 3D structure, which can be manipulated by holding the mouse to turn the molecule around and, for example, bring the ligand to the fore. PLIP software (Salentin, Schreiber, Haupt, Adasme, & Schroeder, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.305#cpz1305-bib-0030]) is integrated to detail atomic interactions between the lectin and the ligand. Mousing over one of the listed interactions on the left updates the view on the right to locate where that particular interaction is located in the structure. In the same way, details of the same BambL interacting with the Fuc(a1-2)Gal(b1-4)GlcNAc type 2 ligand are found at https://unilectin.eu/unilectin3D/display_structure?pdb=3ZZV[href=https://unilectin.eu/unilectin3D/display_structure?pdb=3ZZV], and comparison of both ligands is displayed in Figure 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.305#cpz1305-fig-0007].\nIn the end, a user can shape new assumptions on blood group O recognition based on a clearer understanding of specificity. Moreover, structural data can be downloaded for further computational studies.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7f101c5c-a88b-4cf8-afb7-dc24aa1edb8a/cpz1305-fig-0007-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 7\nScreen captures of the PLIP window illustrating the basis for the recognition of H-type 1 and H-type 2 epitopes by BambL.",
    "LectomeXplore is a module of UniLectin dedicated to the exploration of predicted lectins from each of the 109 classes of UniLectin3D. Translated genomes (proteomes) stored in UniProtKB and RefSeq sequence databases have been screened to generate all putative lectins (lectome) for each available species. LectomeXplore can be searched by assessing the extent of a class of lectins in the kingdoms of life. In this protocol, we demonstrate how to analyze the lectome of a specified organism and how to compare it with other species of the same genus, but living in different environments. This is applied to investigating the lectomes of two Pseudomonas species that have been widely characterized, P. syringae, a plant pathogen, and P. fluorescens, a ubiquitous bacterium present in soil with much less pathogenic behavior. More specifically, P. syringae is a plant pathogen that causes damage in a wide range of plants, for example, with large impact on kiwi fruit production in New Zealand and in Italy (Donati et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.305#cpz1305-bib-0013]). In contrast, P. fluorescens is an environmental bacterium that grows in soil and is in general non-pathogenic. The database also contains strains of P. cichorii, a bacterium first isolated on endives and known to cause green midrib rot of greenhouse-grown lettuces (Cottyn et al., 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.305#cpz1305-bib-0012]).\nThe protocol also shows how to investigate a specific lectin class common to Pseudomonas species. The OAA-like lectins were chosen. These organisms were structurally described in the cyanobacteria Oscillatoria agardhii and considered of pharmaceutical significance due to an antiviral activity related to their high affinity for mannose (Koharudin & Gronenborn, 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.305#cpz1305-bib-0020]), and later characterized in Burkholderia and Pseudomonas species.\nNecessary Resources\nHardware\nComputer with internet connection\nSoftware\nUp-to-date Web browser such as Chrome or Firefox. Using Safari or Edge may not be as reliable\nAccess and search LectomeXplore with a query",
    "1. LectomeXplore is accessible via the UniLectin portal via its corresponding button (https://www.unilectin.eu/predict/[href=https://www.unilectin.eu/predict/]). On the LectomeXplore homepage, click on the “search by field” button. The corresponding interface displays search fields spanning lectin characteristics (Fold, class) or phylogenetic properties (Kingdom, species …) to be filled individually or in combination (Fig. 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.305#cpz1305-fig-0008]). Note that a second bioinformatics-dedicated box offers the option to query LectomeXplore with protein or protein properties using accession numbers of different databases.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/fe214c43-abc8-40ab-be9d-a332a1bb5e20/cpz1305-fig-0008-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 8\nLectomeXplore query interface.\nData mining for species-specific genomes\n2. Fill in the species field of the search window to launch the P. syringae lectome search, and then click on the “Load predicted lectin” button. This action results in showing that 65 available strains have been predicted and span six different classes of lectins. The same search is then performed replacing the species name by P. fluorescens, yielding 76 strains spread across 13 classes. These distinct distributions are shown in Figure 9[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.305#cpz1305-fig-0009]. This cross-species comparison seems to indicate that in the narrower niche of plant pathogens, the variety of lectins is reduced. To strengthen this statement, a third Pseudomonas species is searched by typing P. cichorii in the species search field. Only 11 strains and two lectins in two distinct classes are found. In the end, the result of these three searches shows that the lectome of Pseudomonas species living in soil with a more saprophytic and opportunistic behavior, such as P. fluorescens, is more diverse. It could potentially be involved in adhesion to various surfaces.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e5a22332-89fe-4aef-827e-6f1701bc8c3f/cpz1305-fig-0009-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 9\nLectome comparison obtained by entering Pseudomonas syringae (left) and Pseudomonas fluorescens (right) in the “Species” search box of LectomeXplore.\nSearching for a specific lectin in selected genomes",
    "3. Search can be then focused on a lectin of interest, such as OAA-like lectin that was predicted in both P. syringae and P. fluorescens lectomes (see Fig. 9[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.305#cpz1305-fig-0009]). In the search window, type OOA-like in the “class” field and Pseudomonas in the “genus” field. This results in the listing of 90 genes, in exactly 90 Pseudomonas genomes in the database, as shown in Figure 10[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.305#cpz1305-fig-0010]. The monogenic character of this lectin is rather unusual. Interestingly, 20 of these 90 genes are not correctly annotated, and the lectin is not functionally identified in Pfam (Mistry et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.305#cpz1305-bib-0027]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d5e65733-30d7-4219-ae5f-d6c45025bf49/cpz1305-fig-0010-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 10\nResults of searching for the occurrence of OAA-like lectins in the Pseudomonas genus.\nAnalyzing the quality of the prediction\n4. As mentioned above, 20 out of 90 lectins are poorly annotated. Clicking on the magnifying glass icon next to “uncharacterized protein” will display all corresponding entry summaries. Then, clicking on the top right corner of the listed P. putida entry opens a new page with further information on the alignment of this putative lectin with the reference of the class, here OAA-like. This “Amino acid conservation” also singles out the specific amino acids involved in carbohydrate binding. Figure 11[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.305#cpz1305-fig-0011] details this information and shows the match of five out of six binding residues. The sequence logo is another guide for assessing the quality of the alignment. As a matter of fact, many entries in LectomeXplore are named “uncharacterized,” “putative,” or “hypothetical” proteins (approximately 20% of lectins predicted with a score above 0.25). The present example illustrates how lectins of potential interest can be “mined” in genomes where they were not precisely identified.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6a848659-1b4b-49a0-bc27-f36ea16eefdf/cpz1305-fig-0011-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 11\nEntry page of the OAA-like lectin predicted to occur in the P. putida genome."
