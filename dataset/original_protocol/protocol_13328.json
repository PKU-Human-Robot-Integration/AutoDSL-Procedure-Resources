    "1. Splitting and seeding of cells\nWarm up sterile Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) including 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), sterile Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and sterile trypsin to 37 °C. Activate the clean bench.\nPrepare a 6-well plate by adding one sterile glass cover slip (10 mm) to each well using sterile forceps.\nPut a 10 cm cell culture dish with Cos7 cells under the clean bench. Under the clean bench, aspirate the cells' medium using a vacuum device.\nHold the angulated cell culture dish in one hand and add 10 mL of sterile PBS to the side of the cell culture dish to avoid rinsing off cells. Put the cell culture dish down so that PBS rinses the complete cell culture dish.\nRemove the PBS and add 1 mL of trypsin to the middle of the cell culture dish and incubate for 5 min at 37 °C.\nStop the trypsinization reaction by adding 10 mL of DMEM including 10% FCS and pipette the cell solution up and down with a pipettor to manually separate the cells.\nAnalyze the cell number per milliliter using a counting chamber.\nSeed 68,000 cells in 2 mL medium per well onto the glass cover slips in the 6-well plate. Distribute the cells within the 6-well plate by cautiously shaking the plate horizontally and vertically.\n\tNOTE: Cells should lie scattered.\nIncubate the cells overnight in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2.\n2. Transfection of cells",
    "Prepare two sterile 1.5 mL tubes (one for diluted DNA (A) and one for diluted reagent for cationic lipid transfection (B)). Pipette 0.75 µg of nephrin and 0.75 µg of podocin cDNA expression plasmid per well into one 1.5 mL tube and dilute it into 100 µL of reduced serum medium per well. Add 3 µL of cationic lipid transfection reagent per well to the second 1.5 mL tube and dilute with 100 µL of reduced serum medium. Incubate both reactions for 5 min at room temperature.\nCombine both reactions (A and B) to a DNA-lipid complex and incubate for 20 min at room temperature. Cautiously add 200 µL of the DNA-lipid complex to each well.\nIncubate the transfected cells at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 48 h without changing the medium.\n3. Immunolabeling of cellular structures\nPrepare a fixing solution (4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS, 1 mL/well), the permeabilization solution (0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 in PBS, 1 mL/well), and a blocking solution (5% (v/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS, 1 mL/well).\nRemove the medium with a vacuum device. Add 2 mL of PBS to each well to remove extra medium. Aspirate the PBS completely.\n\tNOTE: To avoid washing away cells with PBS, make sure to pipette PBS not onto the glass cover slip directly.\nFix cells with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) dissolved in PBS for 10 min at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, fix cells in 3% (v/v) glyoxal-ethanol18.\nDiscard PFA and wash cells twice in PBS (2 mL each) by avoiding direct pipetting onto the glass cover slips. Permeabilize the fixed cells with Triton X-100 0.5% (w/v) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature.\nRemove the permeabilization solution and wash twice with PBS as indicated in step 3.2.",
    "Block the cells by adding 1 mL of 5% (v/v) BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Incubate the cells with 200 µL of the primary antibody (anti-podocin antibody 1:200 in 1% (v/v) BSA in PBS) overnight at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, incubate the primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature.\nRemove the primary antibody and wash three times with PBS as in step 3.2. Add the secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 1:1000 in 1% (v/v) BSA in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Keep the cells in the dark using a box.\nDiscard the secondary antibody and wash with PBS three times.\nRemove PBS and incubate the cells with 200 µL of anti-nephrin antibody 1:100 in 1% (v/v) BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Wash with PBS three times. Keep the cells in the dark using a box.\nRemove PBS and incubate with the secondary antibody donkey anti-guinea pig 633, 1:200, for 1 h at room temperature. Wash with PBS three times. Keep the cells in the dark using a box.\n4. Expansion microscopy\nPreparation\nTo form the spacers for the gelation chamber, cut glass cover slips #1.0 and #1.5 into 5 mm stripes (four each per glass slide) using a diamond knife. Position the #1.5 mm cover slip stripes so that they form a square of 2.5 cm length on a glass slide and place them into a staining chamber (Figure 2A1-C1). Pipette a droplet of ddH2O into the corners of the square to adhere the glass cover slip stripes to each other and to the glass slide (Figure 2A2-C2).",
    "NOTE: Avoid complete drying of ddH2O as the adhesion force will get lost. If needed, apply more droplets of ddH2O. Wait for approximately 20 min so that #1.5 mm cover slips are stably attached before starting with step 4.1.2.\nPlace four #1.0 glass cover slip stripes per cover slip onto the #1.5 mm cover slips. Adhere the stripes by pipetting a droplet on each #1.5 mm cover slip stripe (Figure 2A3-C3).\n\t\tNOTE: The gel's thickness should be at least 0.15 mm to facilitate handling in the progress of the protocol. However, to avoid excessive gel on top of the cells, keep the spacers height close to the cell substrate. By using #1.5 and #1.0 cover slip stripes as spacers, the spacers height will be approximately 0.3 mm. The cells adhere to the cover glass (height 0.12 mm). Therefore, the gel will be thick enough to handle but excessive gel on top of the cells is avoided using #1.0 and #1.5 cover glass stripes as spacers.\nFor the gelation chamber lid, wrap a cover glass (#1.5) with paraffin film. Avoid any folds or dirt on the paraffin film (Figure 2A5-C5).\nAnchoring and polymerization (gelation)\nPrepare the anchoring buffer (see Table 1). For anchoring treatment, replace PBS with 250 µL of anchoring buffer per well directly onto the glass cover slip and incubate for 3 h at room temperature. Keep substrate in the dark using a box.\n\t\t​NOTE: Alternatively, incubate overnight at room temperature. Prepare fresh anchoring buffer for every experiment and wait for 10-15 min until it is dissolved properly. 6-((Acryloyl)amino)hexanoic acid, succinimidyl ester (AcX) should be replaced every 4-5 months to ensure adequate anchoring.\nRemove the anchoring buffer and wash once with 1.5 mL PBS per well.",
    "To stain actin fibres, thaw an ExM compatible phalloidin-solution and incubate the phalloidin (5 µL of phalloidin diluted in 195 µL of 1% (v/v) BSA in PBS/well) for 45 min at room temperature. Keep samples in the dark using a box.\nIn the meantime, dissolve sodium acrylate in ddH2O using a stirring device. On ice, prepare the monomer solution (see Table 1).\n\t\tNOTE: Dissolved sodium acrylate should be a clear and colorless solution. If the solution is yellow, replace with new sodium acrylate.\nPrepare the gelling solution on ice (see Table 1). Pipette ammoniumperoxidsulfate (APS) into the gelling solution right before the gelling solution is applied to the gelation chamber.\nRemove phalloidin from the cells and wash with 1.5 mL of PBS twice at room temperature. Leave 1.5 mL PBS within the well to facilitate removal of the sample on the glass cover slip.\nPlace the cells on the cover glass into the gelling chamber using forceps and a cannula to lift the cover glass slip from the 6-well plate.\n\t\tNOTE: The cells should be on the top of the glass cover slip. The glass cover slip should not touch the spacers.\nAdd APS to the gelling solution and vortex shortly. Pipette 200 µL of gelling solution on the sample (Figure 2A4-C4). Cautiously close the gelation chamber by avoiding air bubbles within the gel (Figure 2A5-C5).\nIncubate the gelling chamber for at least 1 h at 37 °C to polymerize the gel in the wet staining chamber.\nHomogenization (digestion)\nTake the staining chamber out of the incubator. To open the gelation chamber lid, introduce a razor blade between the lid and the spacer. Remove the lid cautiously. Remove the spacers with the razor blade and eliminate all extra gel by cutting it with the razor blade.",
    "Put the slide with the gel and cover glass into a dish filled with PBS. By shaking gently, remove the detached cover glass from the gel. To remove the gel from the dish easily, put the slide below the gel to attach the gel to the slide.\nWith the gel on the slide, divide the gel in small pieces (quarter of the gel is divided into two to three pieces) using the razor blade. Gently push one piece of gel into a well of a 6-well plate with glass bottom and enfold it by a paintbrush. Keep the gel moisturized with a little amount of PBS using the paintbrush to avoid dehydration of the gel.\n\t\tNOTE: The cells face downwards.\nUsing an inverted microscope, take overview images with low numerical aperture to determine the expansion factor after expansion.\nPrepare the digestion buffer (see Table 1). Dilute Proteinase K to 4 U/mL in digestion buffer to receive the digestion solution.\n\t\tNOTE: Digestion buffer without Proteinase K can be stored at 4 °C for 1-2 weeks.\nAdd 500 µL of the digestion solution to each well and immerse the gel within the solution. Let it digest overnight at room temperature and close the lid keeping the samples in the dark.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, let it digest at 37 °C for 1 h.\nExpansion\nRemove the digestion solution with a pipette and discard it. Add 1 mL of ddH2O. Incubate the immersed gel for 10 min at room temperature.\nRemove the water and add 1 mL of fresh ddH2O. Wait for 10 min and continue exchanging water every 10 min until a plateau of expansion is reached.\n\t\tNOTE: Sample expansion up to 4.5-fold is achievable. The gel becomes optically clear.\nImaging",
    "Remove the water from the gel and directly start microscopy. Using an inverted microscope, primarily use an air objective (low magnification) to find imaged cells in the pre-expansion state (step 4.3.4).\nSwitch to a 40x (oil/water) and 63x objective for better resolution. Excite with the wavelength of interest and take the image via the camera.\nValidation\nTake an overview image of the sample. Find and match the same structures within the sample that were imaged in step 4.3.4. Use the channel with the best signal-to-noise ratio for validation (Figure 3 A-B).\n\t\tNOTE: Adjust the imaging parameters to achieve similar brightness as in the image acquired in the non-expanded state (step 4.3.4).\nOverlay pre- and post-expansion images by rotating and shifting them with ImageJ. Use the distance measuring tool in ImageJ to measure the distances between clearly identifiable structures. Measure at least 10 different structures.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, use a Python script to measure distances as described in14.\nCalculate the expansion factor by dividing post-/pre-expansion measurements.\nTo determine distortions, take images with a higher numerical aperture (Figure 4A-B). Overlay these images and analyze them with ImageJ or as described in15.\n\t\tNOTE: Determination of distortions should be performed routinely but not necessarily on every sample.\nSubscription Required.
