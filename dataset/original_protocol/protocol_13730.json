  "procedures": [
    "This protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee for the use of animals of the USP Medicine School, Num. Project: 1343/2019-CEUA: FMUSP. For this protocol, C57BL/6 mice, aged 6 weeks, weighing 20 ± 2 g were used (n = 9/group).\n1. Laparotomy\nAnesthetize animals with xylazine (10 mg/kg) and ketamine solution (80 mg/kg), subcutaneously (0.1 mL/10g of body weight) using a 1 mL syringe and 13x0.45mm needle 26G ½. Check for sufficient anesthesia depth by pinching the toe. Control body temperature using heated pads. Ensure that all surgical materials are sterile.\nClean the abdominal area with 5% povidone-iodine solution and use a trimmer to remove hair between the chest and lower abdomen (approximately 2 cm2). Clean the surgical area with 70% alcohol.\nImmobilize the animal on the surgical board using surgical tape. Use scissors to cut 5 mm of the skin horizontally, on the upper part of the abdomen and 1 cm below the xiphoid process. Repeat the cut on the peritoneum. This will result in a laparotomy with minimal exposure of the cavity.\n2. Locating and exposing the pancreas\nWith the aid of a retractor, pull the liver towards the mouse's head, ~1 cm from the intestine.\nLocate the region of the pancreas that will be injected with sodium taurocholate (pancreas head). Locate the duodenum with reference to the liver- below the liver, on the right side (on the left as the mouse is viewed). The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine and is connected to the final portion of the stomach.\nWith the aid of forceps, lift the liver towards the animal head, and gently pull the small intestine portion. Fix the two lateral ends of the small intestine with a 6-0 polypropylene suture to better view the distal portion of the common bile duct.",
    "3. Severe acute pancreatitis induction\nTemporarily occlude the proximal common bile duct with a microvessel clip to prevent retrograde infusion from leaking into the liver. The common bile duct can be seen on the liver side of the duodenum and its junction with the duodenum will appear white. Expose the organ out of the abdominal cavity.\nPuncture the periampullary region (whitish part of the small intestine's wall) to access the common bile duct with a 0.4 mm needle connected to a 0.54 mm polyethylene tube.\nMake a temporary occlusion of the distal common bile duct with 8-0 suture to prevent the sodium taurocholate solution from leaking into the duodenum.\nStart the infusion pump and program a 2.5% sodium taurocholate solution (diluted in 0.9% saline) infusion at a constant speed of 10 µL/10 g body weight for 3 min.\nAfter the infusion, remove the microvessel clip, the temporary 8-0 suture, and the injection needle from the bile pancreatic duct to reconstitute the physiological flow of the bile.\nAt the end, suture the abdomen with 6-0 nonabsorbent monofilament polypropylene suture. The time between the laparotomy and the end suture should be a maximum of 30 min (see Figure 1).\nAfter the surgery, house the animals in polyethylene boxes lined with wood shavings and water and food ad libitum.\nTreat control mice in the same manner as the experimental mice but ensure that the infusate consists of saline only. Perform the surgical procedure and the infusion of saline solution (10 mL/min, for 3 min) in a control group (SHAM) to eliminate the inflammatory bias caused by surgery and cannulation.\nUse tramadol 12.5 mg/kg subcutaneously every 8 hours, starting after post-surgical recovery.\n4. Methods for analysis",
    "At 12 h after AP induction, anesthetize the animals with xylazine (10 mg/kg) and ketamine (80 mg/kg) to collect approximately 250 µL of blood via the orbital plexus.\n\t\nGently hold the skin on the back, promoting a slight protrusion of the eyeball, and position it with the eye facing upwards.\nInstill a drop of eye ointment containing local anesthetic in the animal's eye.\nPosition the end of the capillary tube in the medial corner of the eye and insert it gently under the eyeball, with an angle of ~30°-45°. Rotate the capillary tube until blood flow begins. Remember that it is not necessary to use force for the procedure.\nOnce the collection is over, ensure homeostasis by keeping the eyelids closed by light compression with the gauze. Discard the capillary tube in the sharps container19.\nCentrifuge the serum (700 x g, 15 min) and stock the supernatant for amylase and IL-6 dosing (step 4.7 and 4.8).\nEuthanize mice by CO2 asphyxiation.\nUse a 27 G needle to inject 4 mL of ice-cold 1x PBS into the peritoneal cavity. Tened the abdominal skin and ensure that the needle is pushed slowly in the peritoneum to not puncture any organs. After the injection, gently massage the peritoneum for 10 s to remove cells adhered to the peritoneum.\nUsing scissors and tweezers, make a small cut (0.5 cm) on the inner skin and musculature to expose the abdominal cavity. Insert a bulb pipette in the peritoneum and collect the fluid. Be careful not to aspirate fatty tissue or other organs.\nCollect as much fluid as possible and deposit the collected cell suspension in tubes kept on ice. Discard the bulb pipette in the sharps container20. Centrifuge the peritoneal fluid (250 x g, 5 min) and stock the supernatant for IL-6 dosing (step 4.9).",
    "Collect the pancreas region adjacent to the duodenum (<5mm).\nProcess the pancreas by fixing in 10% formalin and incorporate it into paraffin.\n\t\nStain the slides with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathological analyzes under light microscopy. Use Schmidt's protocol21 (pancreatic edema, acinar cell, injury/necrosis, pancreatic inflammation) to assess the extent of AP.\nMeasure amylase (U/dL) using commercially available kits according to the manufacturer's recommendations.\nMeasure IL-6 by Luminex assays using commercial kits according to the manufacturer's recommendations.\nStore the serum and peritoneal fluid supernatant obtained in the steps 4.1 and 4.4 in a freezer at -80 °C if needed.\nSubscription Required.
