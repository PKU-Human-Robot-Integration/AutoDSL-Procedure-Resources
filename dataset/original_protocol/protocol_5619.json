    "DNA extraction and quantificationCultivate cells of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (around 0.5 x 106 cells ml-1) in shake flasks at 25 °C under constant white fluorescent light (100 µmol photons m-2 m-1) in TAP liquid media (Harris, 2001) with gentle shaking. Normally it will reach exponential phase (around 5 x 106 cells ml-1) after 24 h. Isolate and purify the genomic DNA of the mutant with the CTAB method (Schroda et al., 2001). Briefly, after cells grow to logarithmic phase (around 5 x 106 cells ml-1), harvest a total of 5 x 107 cells by centrifugation and suspend in 500 µl lysis buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.75 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 2% [w/v] SDS, and 1.0 mg ml-1 Proteinase K). Incubate the lysates for 2 h at 55 °C, and then add 80 µl of 5 M KCl and 70 µl of preheated 10% CTAB and incubate for 10 min at 65 °C. Extract the lysates twice with (500 µl) phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v/v), and then add (500 µl) chloroform to eliminate the remaining phenol. The nucleic acids are precipitated for 20 min on ice by addition of 500 µl of isopropanol, and washed with 70% cold ethanol. Resuspend the air-dried pellets in 50 µl sterile water. Quantify the purified DNA using NanoDrop 2000, and add water to adjust the final concentration to be of 50 ng µl-1.Note: The concentration of the cells mentioned is measured with Multisizer 3 Coulter counter. PCR amplificationThis procedure largely follows the protocol first published by González-Ballester et al. (2005). To identify the DNA sequence around the site of insertion, two subsequent sets of PCR reactions are required, named here as the 1st and 2nd amplification.",
    "The 1st PCR amplification is to amplify a fragment from genomic DNA of the mutant using one AphVIII gene-specific primer with one of the degenerate primers (Figure 1). To increase the chances of amplification, 4 degenerate primers can be tested, and each of them contains a sequence-specific part (Q0 at the 5’ end) and a degenerate part (3’ end). The PCR product will be used as a template for a second round of PCR amplification (the 2nd PCR amplification) with the use of two sequence-specific primers. Degenerate primers (DegTaqI, DegPstI, DegAluI and DegSacII, including Q0) and the marker gene (AphVIII) specific primers (RB1 and RB4) are shown in Table 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180131/20180131233340_6041.jpgFigure 1. Outline of the principals for RESDA PCR. This schematic is adapted from González-Ballester et al., 2005.Table 1. Primers and their sequences used in this protocolimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180131/20180131233448_0070.jpg★I, inosine, N, A + T + G + C; S, G + C; W, A + T.*Gene-specific primers (RB1 and RB4) can be designed based on the type of marker gene (i.e., AphVII, Ble and aadA) used for mutagenesis. The first amplification In the 1st amplification, the AphVIII gene-specific primer (RB1) and one of the degenerate primers are used to amplify a fragment flanking the antibiotic marker gene AphVIII from the genomic DNA purified from the mutant. Four independent reactions can be set up by using four different degenerate primers and RB1, respectively. The composition of the PCR reaction mixture and cycling program are shown in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively.Table 2.

    "The second amplification To get more specific PCR products, the maker gene-specific primer (RB4) and the specific primer (Q0) at the 5’ end of degenerate primers are used to amplify using the PCR from the 1st amplification as a template (One µl diluted PCR products (1/1,000) from 1st amplification). The composition of the PCR reaction mixture and cycling program are shown in Table 4 and Table 5, respectively.Table 4.

Some representative results are shown in Figure 2, and the examples of RESDA-PCR success rate after amplification by four independent degenerat primers and RB1, followed by further amplification with RB4 and Q0 primers are shown in Table 6.Cut–off the well-separated PCR products (marked with *) from the gel and purify using the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up Kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL) according to manufacturer’s instructions.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180131/20180131234132_0972.jpgFigure 2. Examples of results of RESDA-PCR using the degenerate primer DegTaqI. The PCR products shown are the results of two rounds of PCR reactions: using DegTaqI and RB1, followed by further amplification with RB4 and Q0 primers.Note: M refers to DNA marker (Exact Ladder DNA PreMix 2 log); and each lane (1, 2, 3…) refers to the amplification from independent single mutant.

Other Taq DNA polymerase can also be used in this step.Directly ligate the recovered fragments to pCR II-Blunt-TOPO vector. This step can be completed within 5 min without adding a single deoxyadenosine (A) to the 3’ ends of PCR products. Add the ligation reaction components into a tube as described in Table 7, mix gently and incubate for 5 min at 22 °C. Note: pCR-Blunt II-TOPO allows direct selection of recombinants via disruption of the lethal E. coli gene, ccdB (Bernard et al., 1994). Cells that contain a non-recombinant vector are killed upon plating.The ligated products are transformed into One Shot competent cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturers’ instructions. Transformants are selected on LB agar plates containing 50 μg ml-1 kanamycin (37 °C for overnight).Table 7.
