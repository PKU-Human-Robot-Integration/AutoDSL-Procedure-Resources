    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\ndsRNA detection by immunoblotting\nTiming: 2–3 days\nImmunoblotting is a technique that can be used to study molecular characteristics of dsRNAs such as length and number of different species as well as direct quantification. In this case, it is recommended that the RNA is first separated by electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting. A simplified method without RNA electrophoresis can also be used for rapid quantification of dsRNA by dot blotting when information about size and species is not required.\nWe describe below two strategies to perform immunoblot for dsRNA detection on Nylon membranes: transfer of RNAs to the membrane after gel electrophoresis or direct spotting the RNA onto the membrane. We efficiently captured dsRNA immunoblotting images with a chemiluminescence imager or using high sensitivity X-ray films, with results that may vary according to the antibody. Of note, immunoblotting using the 9D5 antibody displayed high background when we used X-ray films.\nRNA separation by electrophoresis in non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel\nTiming: 4–6 h\nPrepare the RNA electrophoresis apparatus for running:\nPrepare a homemade 3.5%–5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel or, alternatively, use a precast gel.\nAdd the non-denaturing polyacrylamide solution into the cast.\nAfter the polyacrylamide gel has polymerized, remove the gel from the cast stand and then from the clamp assembly.\nRinse the glass plate surfaces with DEPEC-treated H2O to remove residual polyacrylamide gel.\nDrain excess water.\nMount the gel in the upper chamber (2 gels for each cassette or 1 gel and an acrylic plate on the other side) with spacer plates outwards.\nPlace the upper chamber in the running electrophoresis tank.\nFill the upper chamber and the tank with 1× TBE running buffer. Check for leaking from the chamber to the tank.\nNote: Check for leaking from the upper chamber carefully.",
    "Carefully remove the comb using clean powder-free cloves.\nRinse the wells with 1× TBE using a syringe to clean debris from lanes.\nUsing the Nanodrop quantification, calculate and transfer 5–10 μg of total RNA into pre-cooled 1.5 mL microtubes.\nNote: Use nuclease-free H2O to produce equal volumes of RNA samples for all samples.\nAdd 6× DNA loading dye to RNA samples. Do not exceed 15 μL of total volume (RNA solution + loading dye).\nQuickly spin samples in a pre-cooled centrifuge and keep samples on ice.\nLoad lanes in the polyacrylamide gel(s) with RNA samples.\nIf any, load empty wells with equal volume of 6× DNA loading dye + nuclease-free H2O.\nRun gel(s) for 30 min using a voltage of 50 V and then increase to 100 V.\nSuit off the power supply when Xylene cyanole dye runs for 80%–90% of the gel. This may take in 1.5–2 h.\nNote: A DNA ladder can be loaded on the gel and used as control for fractionation and transfer steps.\nRNA transfer to nylon membranes\nTiming: 2–3 h (for step 2)\nThis is the critical step for successful detection of dsRNA by immunoblotting.\nPerform the wet transfer:\nTake 2 thick blotting filter paper and cut them off slightly larger than the size of the membrane.\nSoak sponges and blotting filter paper in the 0.5× TBE (transfer buffer).\nCarefully open the gel cassette, removing the short glass plate and soaking the gel with the spacer glass plate into the transfer buffer.\nTake the spacer glass plate with the gel from the transfer buffer and carefully place a blotting filter paper on top of the gel, invert the montage and remove the spacer glass.",
    "Open the transfer cassette, on the black side place the soaked sponge and then the blotting filter paper with the gel.\nSoak the positively charged Nylon membrane in 0.5× TBE and then place the membrane on top of the gel, removing bubbles using a roller.\nAdd a small amount of transfer buffer and then place a soaked blotting filter paper on top of the membrane.\nAdd a soaked sponge on top of the blotting filter paper and carefully close the transfer cassette.\nPlace the cassette in the transfer module, with the black side of the cassette facing the black side of the module.\nFill the tank with transfer buffer and then close the lid.\nIn a cold room (4°C–6°C), set up the transfer.\nPerform the transfer for 30–60 min using a voltage of 35 V.\nCut off the power supply, open the transfer cassette and take the membrane from the sandwich.\nNote: After RNA transfer to the membrane, stain the remaining gel for 5 min at room temperature with SYBR Gold (1:10,000 dilution in 0.5× TBE buffer) and detect the RNA bands under UV light. No RNA should be visualized in the gel, consistent with an efficiency transfer of RNAs to the membrane.\nAlternatives: Before blocking, the RNAs can be crosslinked to the membrane using UV light, 120 mJ/cm2 (autocrosslink mode in a Stratalinker® UV Crosslinker).\nDot blot\nTiming: 2 h\nDot blot is a simple form of immunoblotting to detect and quantify dsRNAs. This technique can be used to assess different parameters of the immunoblot, such as antibody efficiency, limit of detection, background, and buffer options.\nLoad samples on the Nylon membrane:",
    "Cut off a piece of a positively charged Nylon membrane with a size of 2 cm × 10 cm, increasing another 2 cm for each new dilution (e.g., 3 samples to be blotted require a 6 cm × 10 cm membrane).\nPrepare a solution of RNA in nuclease-free H2O at a concentration of 0.5 μg/μL and then prepare 10× dilutions (6–8 points in total).\nUsing a micropipette, slowly spot 4 μL of samples onto pre-determined locations on the Nylon membrane. Usually, spot centers are separated by 1 cm in the horizontal axis and 2 cm in the vertical axis.\nLet the spots dry before proceeding to the immunoblotting.\nAlternatives: the RNAs can be crosslinked to the membrane using UV light, 120 mJ/cm2 (autocrosslink mode in a Stratalinker® UV Crosslinker).\nDetection of dsRNAs by immunoblotting\nTiming: 2 days (for step 4)\nAfter transferring RNAs to Nylon membranes after gel electrophoresis or directly spotting onto membranes by Dot Blot, proceed to the immunoblotting for detection of dsRNAs.\nBlock non-specific sites on the membrane:\nPlace the RNA membrane into a container with 10 mL of PBS-Tween, with the RNA side of the membrane facing up.\nPrepare 10 mL of blocking solution (50 μg/mL Sheared Salmon DNA, 1× PBS-Tween, 5% non-fat milk wt:vol).\nRemove PBS-Tween from the membrane and add 10 mL of the blocking solution.\nIncubate the membrane overnight, rocking at 4°C.\nProbe membranes with anti-dsRNA antibodies:\nDilute anti-dsRNA in primary antibody solution (PBS-Tween, 2% non-fat dry milk wt:vol).\nRemove the blocking solution from the membrane and replace with 10 mL of primary antibody solution.\nIncubate for 2 h at room temperature in a rocking shaker.\nNote: The appropriate anti-dsRNA dilution will need to be established when testing these antibodies for the first time in different cell and virus systems.",
    "Alternatives: Incubating the primary antibody for 16 h at 4°C may increase sensitivity.\nIncubate with secondary antibody:\nRemove the primary antibody and transfer the solution into a 15 mL conical tube for further reuse.\nWash the membrane three times with 10 mL of PBS-Tween for 10 min at room temperature while rocking.\nPrepare the secondary antibody dilution (Anti-HRP, Goat-Anti-Rabbit for 9D5 and Goat-Anti-Mouse for J2, 1:10,000 in PBS-Tween, 2% non-fat dry milk wt:vol).\nReplace the PBS-Tween with 10 mL of the secondary antibody solution.\nIncubate for 1 h at room temperature with agitation.\nRemove secondary antibody solution.\nWash three times with 10 mL of PBS-Tween for 10 min at room temperature while rocking.\nChemiluminescence detection:\nCut a piece of plastic and lay onto the chemiluminescence detection tray.\nRemove the RNA membrane from the PBS-Tween, drain the excess of liquid using a paper towel and place the membrane on top of the plastic.\nAdd 250–500 μL of ECL substrate on top of the membrane and ensure the homogenous distribution throughout the membrane.\nIncubate for 1 min and cover with another piece of plastic on top of the membrane and remove air bubbles.\nSet the auto-exposure mode for detection of chemiluminescence on to the Fusion FX imager. Test different exposure times to find the best image.\nCarefully transfer the membrane back into the western blot incubation box and wash three times with 10 mL of PBS-Tween.\nDry the membrane on top of a paper towel with the RNA faced up at room temperature.\nCarefully wrap the membrane in filter paper and store at 4°C if necessary.",
    "Note: If the detection of dsRNA fails or displays a weak signal, please refer to troubleshooting problems 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3], respectively. In the case dsRNA bands were not well resolved in 3.5% polyacrylamide gels, please refer to troubleshooting problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\nImmunofluorescence of dsRNA\nTiming: 3–5 days\nImmunofluorescence (IFA) is a technique to analyze many aspects of spatial (subcellular and tissue) distribution of dsRNA species during virus infection.\nThe steps below describe the procedure to perform IFA in Drosophila S2 cells. S2 cells are semi-adherent cells, and in our hands, the culture works better maintaining them as non-adherent. We usually perform IFA using coverslips, but S2 cells also adhere well in chambered cell culture slides.\nPrepare S2 cell culture for viral infections:\nCount and transfer 107 cells into 15 mL conical tubes. Use cell densities between 3–6 × 106 cells/mL.\nInfect S2 cells with 105 pfu of IIV-6 (0.01 pfu/cell) and 107 pfu of DCV (1 pfu/cell). For mock infected controls, use the equivalent amount of complete Schneider’s media.\nIncubate for 1 h at 25°C on a rotating shaker or manually rocking cells every 10 min.\nCentrifuge cells at 200 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAdd fresh media to the cells and resuspend them at density of 1 × 106 cells/mL with 10 mL serological pipettes.\nHomogenize and transfer 2 mL of the cell suspension into each well in 6-well plates.\nIncubate S2 cells at 25°C.\nNote: Virus-derived dsRNAs are better analyzed at 72 h post infection for IIV-6 and at 24 h for DCV.",
    "Optional: IIV-6 replicative DNA can be marked with BrdU. To mark IIV-6 DNA, 70 h post IIV-6 infection, S2 cells are homogenized and BrdU added at a final concentration of 20 μM. S2 cells are incubated for 1 h at 25°C and then transferred to coverslips for cell attachment for one hour.\nSterilize coverslips:\nIn the culture hood, fill 2 wells of a 6-well plate with 100% ethanol and 1 well with sterilized H2O (DEPEC-tread H2O is suitable here).\nWith forceps, soak 13 mm coverslips in the first well with 100% ethanol for at least 5 s.\nTransfer single coverslips from 100% ethanol into sterilized double-distilled water (ddH2O) for 5 s and then to the second well with 100% ethanol.\nIn an inverted 6-well plate lid, place coverslips on its walls to dry. Repeat these steps for all remaining coverslips.\nWith forceps, drop single coverslip into wells in a 12-well plate.\nAdd 500 μL of Poly-L-lysine (0.01% wt:vol) or Concanavalin A (ConcA, 0.5 mg/mL) solution diluted in 1× PBS to each well of the 12-well plate. Incubate within the hood for 1 h and then wash once with 500 μL of 1× PBS.\nTransfer infected S2 cells to poly-L-Lysine- or Concanavalin A (ConcA)-treated coverslips:\nAt each indicated time point, remove the plates with infected cells from the incubator.\nResuspend cells into the media and homogenize.\nTransfer 500 μL of the cell suspension into the wells of the 12-well plate containing the coverslips.\nIncubate cells 1 h at 25°C to allow cell attachment.\nFix and permeabilize cells:\nRemove the media and fix cells with 4% formaldehyde solution (PFA) for 10–15 min at room temperature.\nWash three times with 1× PBS.\nIncubate 5 min at room temperature.",
    "Permeabilize fixed cells adding 500 μL of PBSTX into each well and incubate for 10 min at room temperature. Repeat once this action.\nOptional: After permeabilization, coverslips can be treated with RNases to confirm whether the signal originates from dsRNA. We use the RNase mix A/T1 (Thermo) and Short Cut RNase III (NEB) to verify the origin of IFA signal, as the latter digests dsRNA but the former should not affect the signal. For this step, the use of Chambered Cell Culture Slides or 24-well plates is more convenient to save reagents.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2361_10.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2361_11.csv\nBlock non-specific sites and incubate with anti-dsRNA antibodies:\nRemove the PBSTX and add 500 μL of IFA blocking buffer into each well and incubate for 1 h at room temperature with gentle rocking.\nDuring this time, prepare the primary antibody solution in IFA blocking buffer.\nNote: The appropriate anti-dsRNA dilution will need to be established when testing these antibodies for the first time in different cell and virus systems. We tested different dilutions of anti-dsRNAs, especially 9D5 antibody that we had less information than the most cited J2 antibody.\nOn a Parafilm placed in the bottom of a 90 mm culture dish, add 25–50 μL of the anti-dsRNA solution for each sample (4–6 droplets/culture dish).\nAfter blocking and using a pipette tip and forceps, take coverslips from the 12-well plate and place them face down on the anti-dsRNA droplet.\nAdd cotton rolls imbibed on water in the 90 mm culture dish without touching the Parafilm.\nCover the 90 mm culture dish with the lid and incubate overnight at 4°C.\nOptional: Anti-dsRNA antibodies can be combined with other primary antibodies for co-staining. We usually combine dsRNA detection with IIV-6 DNA staining using BrdU or nuclear envelope using Lamin0.\nIncubate with Fluorophore-conjugated antibody solution:",
    "Add 500 μL of PBSTX into wells in a 12-well plate.\nCarefully, remove coverslips from the culture dish, transfer them into 12-well plate containing PBSTX, now face up. Wash three times with PBSTX for 5 min each.\nDuring this time, prepare the secondary antibody solution in PBSTX, adding 1:300 Goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 488 for detection of the monoclonal antibody (mAb) J2, 1:300 Goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 546 for detection of 9D5 and 1:500 Hoechst for DNA staining.\nNote: The presence of other targets requires a combination of different Fluorophore-conjugated antibodies for visualization.\nChange the Parafilm in the 90 mm culture dish, add 25–50 μL droplets of the secondary antibody solution for each sample (4–6 droplets/culture dish).\nTake the coverslips from the washing solution and place the coverslips face down on the droplets.\nAdd cotton rolls imbibed on water in the 90 mm culture dish, cover with dish lid and wrap the culture dish with aluminum foil paper to protect from light.\nIncubate for 1 h at room temperature.\nMount slides for microscopy:\nAdd 500 μL of PBSTX into wells in a 12-well plate.\nCarefully, remove coverslips from the culture dish, transfer them into 12-well plate, now face up. Wash three times with PBSTX for 5 min each.\nRemove the PBSTX and add 500 μL of 1× PBS into wells with coverslips.\nClean microscopy slides with 70%–100% ethanol using a lint-free wipe.\nAdd 10 μL of Hydromount medium onto microscope slides.\nCarefully place the coverslip face down onto the Hydromount droplets.\nTransfer the slides to a light-protective container and store at room temperature overnight.\nUsing transparent nail polish, seal the rim of the coverslips and transfer the slides to a light-protective container at room temperature for nail polish drying (1–2 h).",
    "Store slides at 4°C until imaging. For long storage, keep slides at −20°C.\nNote: We usually mount at least one coverslip for mock and another from infected cells in the same slide to prevent unwanted noise caused by differences between slides.\nAlternatives: We have used different mounting media, like DAKO (Agilent Technologies) and VectaShield (Vector Laboratories) with good results. When the mounting medium have DAPI, such as VectaShield H-1200, the Hoechst addition in the secondary antibody solution must be omitted.\nCritical: Bubbles may form in the medium during mounting and should be avoided.\nPerform wide-field fluorescence or confocal microscopy:\nSelect the proper objective lens and laser wavelengths to capture images.\nAdjust the laser power, detector gain, resolution (number of pixels per image), single or stack acquisition and file format to save images.\nNote: Set the parameters to obtain the appropriate signal to differentiate dsRNA levels in virus infected compared to the background signal present in mock cells.\nNote: If the detection of dsRNA fails or displays a weak signal in the IFA, please refer to troubleshooting problems 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3], respectively."
