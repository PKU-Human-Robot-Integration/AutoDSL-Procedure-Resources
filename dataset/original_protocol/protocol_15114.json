    "1. Preparation Before Spinal Cord Injury\nThe surgical instruments required for this procedure are scalpel, pickups with and without teeth, hemostats, self retaining retractors, fine tip rongeurs, needle driver, absorbable sutures, and skin clip applicators. Other surgical supplies required are surgical drapes, sterile sheets for surgical field, gauze sponges, cotton-tip applicators, and metallic foil. Autoclave the surgical instruments and supplies prior to the surgery. Use the individual set of instruments and supplies for one animal. Clean the surgical area and apparatus (impactor, light source, stereotactic frame, glass bead sterilizers, and heating pads) with alcohol wipes. \nOpen the surgical drapes and use sterile gloves to drape the surgical field carefully avoiding contamination. Open the individual instruments sterilely and carefully place those in the surgical field. Cover the knobs and handles of the apparatus likely needed during the procedure with the sterile metallic foil. Switch-on the glass bead sterilizer to be ready for use during the procedure. \n2. Preparation of the Animals",
    "Bring the rats to the laboratory area few hr before the actual procedure. Administer pain medication at least one hr ahead of the expected procedure (typically buprinorphine 1.5 ml of 0.006 mg/ml subcutaneous). Administer preoperative antibiotics (typically Baytril 4 mg/kg subcutaneous). Anesthetize the rats using 90 mg/kg of Ketamine and wait until there is no toe-pinch response. Palpate the most prominent spinous process in the thoracic spine. This level typically corresponds with T10 spinous process. Mark the location of intended level in relation to T10. In our lab we perform a T10 injury. The following narrative describes the technique of T10 SCI. Shave a 3 cm x 6 cm rectangle longitudinally and centered at T10 level. Clean skin three times with Betadine solution. Apply ophthalmic lubricant on each eye. Transfer the rat in a comfortable position to the surgical field carefully avoiding contamination. Insert a rectal temperature probe to monitor the core temperature and adjust the heating accordingly to keep animal temperature as close to normal (~37.5 °C) as possible. Cover the rat with a surgical drape with a window above the surgical site.  \n3. Surgical Procedure",
    "Begin with an approximate 4 cm incision using a #10 blade centered on the T10 mark. Proceed to patiently dissect fascia and muscle layers away from the T9-T11 spinous processes and laminae. Place retractors to retract muscle and fascia away from the bone. While stabilizing the spinous process of T9 sharply divide the interspinous ligament between T9 and T10 using fine scissors. Similarly stabilize the T10 spinous process and divide the interspinous ligament between T10-T11. Use loop magnification to complete the division of ligaments all the way through the ligamentum flavum (Figure 1). The thecal sac is readily apparent once the ligamentum flavum is disconnected. Use fine tip rongeurs to carefully perform piece-meal laminectomy bilaterally at T10. Utmost care is taken to avoid a downward pressure on the thecal sac and inadvertent injury from the rongeur tips. The lamina and spinous process of T10 is completely removed.",
    "Move the animal into position on stabilization platform. Use stabilizing clamps to immobilize the spine by clamping the lateral aspects of the T11 vertebral body followed by the lateral aspects of the T9 vertebral body. Be careful not to compress the rat into the platform with the stabilizing clamps as this would restrict space for respiratory movements and add unwanted stress the animal.  After securing the spinal column settings on the computer-controlled impactor are checked. We typically use impactor tip of 3.0 mm at a speed of 4 cm/s with a depth of 2 mm and a dwell time of 0.3 sec. Extend the impactor tip and lower it until it just touches the cord surface. Retract the tip and lower the device 2 mm towards the spinal cord surface. Release piston at 4 cm/sec to cause severe contusion spinal cord injury. Attain hemostasis using just enough pressure to keep the cotton-tip applicator in place, being careful not to create any unnecessary pressure on the cord. Suture muscle and fascia layers with a figure-8 stitch being careful not to pull the too tight using absorbable sutures. Close the skin with a minimum of 2 small staples; up to 4 or 5 staples may be used if parts of the incision remain open after the first 2 or 3 staples. \n3. Post-procedure Care",
    "Place rats in a warm environment of about 33-35 °C for 24 hr post-surgery. This entails an incubator (while they are unconscious) and a heated cage space once they begin to move. Once rats are fully awake, administer 5ml of saline, 1.5 ml (0.006 mg/ml) of buprinorphine, and 0.1 ml of Baytril all subcutaneously. Continue with buprinorphine subcutaneously twice a day for first 24-48 hr and Baytril once a day for 7 days. Bladders should be manually expressed three times a day until return of bladder function (<2 ml of urine in early morning expression for 3 consecutive days). Animals should also be checked during this time for infection (blood in urine, whitish color, or foul odor), decreased physical activity or problems with wound healing. Presence of infection should be countered with an increased dosage (or re-initiation) of antibiotics in consultation with local veterinarians. Weigh rats daily beginning the day after surgery to assess their recovery.Subscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
