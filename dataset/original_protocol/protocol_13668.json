    "The protocol was carried out in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the ethics review committee of the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University.\n1. Data and grouping\nNOTE: From December 2018 to December 2020, laparoscopic TAPP was performed during gastrointestinal, hernia, and abdominal surgery at the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. A total of 264 patients with inguinal hernia met the criteria and were included in the study.\nSelect adult and unilateral inguinal hernia patients for the surgery.\nApply the following exclusion criteria: recurrent hernia and bilateral hernia; incarcerated or strangulated hernia; other diseases such as ascites, connective tissue disease, heart/kidney failure, and hypoproteinemia; and the use of aspirin, clopidogrel, or other drugs that affect coagulation function.\nDivide the patients randomly into an experimental group and a control group.\n\tNOTE: In this study, 134 cases were assigned to the experimental group and 130 cases to the control group. The general conditions of the two groups, including age, sex, BMI, hernia type, and hernia sac treatment, are shown in Table 1.\nAssign two groups of surgeons from the same team who have received standardized training to perform the surgery.\n\t​NOTE: In this study, the two groups of surgeons were experienced, laparoscopic surgeons. Ensure that there is no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05).\n2. Method for generating the straight-needle, three-tailed knot\nStraighten the needle of 3-0 VICRYL thread 1/2 round needle with an ordinary needle base.\nMake the thread tail according to the sequence shown in Figure 1A-F.\n\t\nOverlap two threads to make a single knot and then tighten the knot.\nPass one of the threads into the knot ring of the first knot.",
    "Lay the tail at both ends against the first knot and then make the second knot.\nTighten the knot.\nLeave the tail at one end of the needle (~12 cm long); cut off the ring and the tail at the other end. Ensure that the length of the remaining three tails is ~0.8 cm.\n3. Suture method\nSuture the control group continuously with a 12 cm long, conventional 1/2 circle curved needle and 3-0 VICRYL absorbable suture.\nIn the experimental group, make three knot-free sutures as described above, and suture the peritoneum continuously.\nSew the three tails of the straight needle into the peritoneum (Figure 2A).\nHold and fix the straight needle using forceps grasped in the left hand.\nPress the straight needle directly into the upper and lower abdominal membranes (Figure 2B; approximately 0.8 cm needle pitch).\nRepeat the above actions and sew 8-10 stitches continuously (Figure 2C).\nRepeating the joint actions of grasping the forceps and holding the needle, tighten the 8-10 needles (Figure 2D) until the whole peritoneal incision is closed.\nTighten the suture after sewing (Figure 2E).\nTie or fix the end of the suture with an absorbable clip (Figure 2F).\n4. Follow-up\nComplete the postoperative follow-up with outpatient visits and telephone conferences for 3-24 months.\n\tNOTE: The median follow-up time was 12 months in this study.\nRecord the occurrence of seroma, recurrence, and mesh infection.\n5. Statistical analysis\nPerform statistical analysis on peritoneal suture time, operation time, hernia recurrence, seroma, mesh infection, visual analog scale (VAS) score, length of hospital stay, and hospitalization expenses.\nExpress data as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and rates.\nCompare the measurement data between groups using a t-test and the observation rate indices using a chi-square test.\nConsider a difference to be statistically significant if P < 0.05.",
