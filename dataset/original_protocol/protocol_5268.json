    "Preparation of a synchronized nematode populationFor NGM plate’s preparation, mix 3 g NaCl, 2.5 g Bacto peptone and 17 g agar in Erlenmeyer flask. Add to 1 L of dH2O. Autoclave 121 °C for 20 min. Cool flask in 55 °C water bath for 15 min. Add 1 ml 1 M CaCl2, 1 ml 5 mg/ml cholesterol in ethanol, 1 ml 1 M MgSO4 and 25 ml 1 M KPO4 (Phosphate) buffer (see Recipes). Swirl to mix well. Using sterile procedures dispense the NGM solution into 60 x 15 mm Petri plates. Fill plates 2/3 full of agar.Pick 10 young adults onto an E. coli OP50 seeded 60 mm NGM plate (see Recipes). Allow the worms to grow 2-3 days to ensure at least 100 gravid adult worms and an adequate number of eggs on the plate.Once reached this worm number, pour 3 ml of M9 buffer (see Recipes) onto the plate and gently swirl it to dislodge the worms. Repeat this procedure one more time using 2 ml of M9 buffer. One plate is enough for bleaching.Using a pipette, transfer the worms to a 15 ml conical tube.Centrifuge for about 1 min at 252 x g to pellet the worms.Aspirate most of the M9 without disturbing the worm pellet.Add about 1 ml of 3% hypochlorite solution and 2.5 ml of 1 N NaOH (see Recipes) to the tube.Vortex the tube for approximately 5 min or until you see a decrease in the number of intact adult worms. Do not bleach for much longer than this or you will kill the eggs.Once most of the bodies have dissolved, neutralize the alkaline hypochlorite by adding M9 buffer until 15 ml of the conical tube and centrifuge at 252 x g for 1 min.",
    "Aspirate most of the supernatant solution without disturbing the egg pellet.Add about 15 ml of M9 to the tube and mix well.Centrifuge again at 252 x g for 1 min.Aspirate most of the M9 without disturbing the egg pellet.Repeat steps A11-A13 at least one more time.Add about 5 ml of fresh M9 and agitate to resuspend the egg-enriched pellet. Incubate overnight at room temperature with gentle rocker stirrer. The eggs will hatch and the animals will arrest as starved L1 larvae.Transfer between 100 and 200 starved L1 larvae to a 60 mm NGM plate with E. coli OP50 cells (1 x 105 cells per plate) or spores (1 x 105 spores per plate) (see Note 2) of each B. subtilis strain and allow the worms to grow 2 days until they reach L4/adult stage.Preparation of nematode samples for intestinal bacterial countingUse an eyebrow hair and collect 50 adult animals in M9 buffer in a 1.5 ml tube (see Note 1).Use the same number of animals (worms) fed on each bacterial strain during sample preparation.Treat the worms with 0.25 mM levamisole to induce temporal paralysis.Superficially sterilize with 3% commercial Bleach for 5 min (see Note 5).Wash at least three times with M9 buffer.After the worms were surface sterilized, worms devoid of outside bacteria are disrupted using a pellet pestle and 1% Triton X-100 (see Note 6).Centrifuge at 14,800 x g for 10 min, remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet of each tube in 500 µl M9 buffer (see Note 4).Preparation of sample dilutions (Figure 1)To begin the procedure, take 50 µl of the cell suspensions and add to 450 µl of deionized water. Shake the suspension well, and label as ‘10-1’.",
    "Before the sample settles, remove 50 µl of the cell suspension with a sterile pipette and transfer it to a 450 µl-deionized water blank. Vortex the sample, and label as ‘10-2’.Repeat this dilution step, using 50 µl of the previous suspension and a 450 µl-deionized water blank. Label these sequentially as tubes ‘10-3’.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170614/20170614014404_5961.jpgFigure 1. Diagram of how to prepare bacterial dilutions. Serial dilution of an initial culture to obtain solutions that are 1/10th, 1/100th and 1/1,000th the concentration of the initial sample (10-1, 10-2 and 10-3 dilutions, respectively). For each dilution, tubes initially have 450 µl of water in them so that the final volume will be 500 µl after the addition of 50 µl of culture.Making spread plates for bacterial cultureTo get bacterial colonies from worm gut isolated E. coli and vegetative B. subtilis (see Figure 2A), take three LB agar plates (see Note 3) and label them as A, B, and C. Vortex samples 10-1, 10-2, and 10-3, and pipette 50 µl onto each plate. This increases the dilution value further, by a factor of ten (A = 10-2, B = 10-3, C = 10-4) (see Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170615/20170615001623_4598.jpgFigure 2. The micrographs show the vegetative cells (A) and spores (B) of Bacillus subtilis. Bar size = 5 µm.Next, dip a glass spreader into ethanol. Place the spreader in a flame for a few seconds to ignite and burn off the ethanol. This will sterilize the spreader.Hold the spreader above the first plate until the flame is extinguished. Open the plate quickly, holding the lid close by. Touch the spreader to the agar away from the inoculum (Inoculum = cells used to begin a culture) to cool, and then spread the drop of inoculum around the surface of the agar until traces of free liquid disappear.",
    "Re-flame the spreader and repeat the process with the next plate, working quickly so as not to contaminate the agar with airborne organisms.Incubate the bacteria plates at 37 °C for 16-18 h. Make sure the plates are inverted during the incubation to prevent drops of moisture from condensation from falling onto the agar surface.Making spread plates for spore cultureHeat-treat the tubes with B. subtilis samples labeled as 10-1, 10-2, and 10-3 for 20 min at 80 °C to kill vegetative cells. Vortex spores samples (see Figure 2B) and pipette 50 µl onto each plate. This increases the dilution value further, by a factor of ten (A = 10-2, B = 10-3, C = 10-4).Next, dip a glass spreader into ethanol. Place the spreader in a flame for a few seconds to ignite and burn off the ethanol. This will sterilize the spreader.Hold the spreader above the first plate until the flame is extinguished. Open the plate quickly, holding the lid close by. Touch the spreader to the agar away from the inoculum to cool, and then spread the drop of inoculum around the surface of the agar until traces of free liquid disappear.Re-flame the spreader and repeat the process with the next plate, working quickly so as not to contaminate the agar with airborne organisms.Incubate the bacteria plates at 37 °C for 16-18 h. Make sure the plates are inverted during the incubation to prevent drops of moisture from condensation from falling onto the agar surface.Bacterial countsAfter incubation, examine all of the bacteria plates carefully, and note differences in colony size and shape.Count and record the number of bacterial colonies. Only count and use for calculation, plates with 30-300 colonies per plate.",
    "The number of colonies per plate bellow 30 is not statistically significant whereas a number higher than 300 colonies per plate is hard to count, and it is possible a colony arise from more than one cell.The number of CFU/worm is calculated as follows:Number of CFU/worm in plate A = (number of colonies x 102)/50Number of CFU/worm in plate B = (number of colonies x 103)/50Number of CFU/worm in plate C = (number of colonies x 104)/50"
