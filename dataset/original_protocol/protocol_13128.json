    "1. Power-on components\nPower on the six plugs (no particular order): Piezoconcept (z-focus), APD0, APD1, green laser, red laser and photodetector.\n2. Software 1-Experimental setup\nLaunch the laser control center.\n\t\nEnsure Continuous Wave - Alternating Constant Current (CW-ACC) mode is selected.\nPower on both the lasers.\nCheck/set the laser powers.\n\t\tNOTE: The laser power will need to be adjusted as measured just before the excitation dichroic, as ND filters and beam splitters in the excitation path will reduce the laser power from the number given on the laser control panel. The numbers given here are power at the excitation dichroic, but the power on the laser control that corresponds to this will need to be worked out.\n\t\t\n220 µW green laser (515 nm, 40 mW)\nµ70 W for red laser (638 nm, 10 mW)\nsmOTTER acquisition software\n\t\nConnect the lasers, detectors, z-stage, and camera. Configure them correctly (might vary depending on settings of particular NI card setup).\n3. Alignment of emission path (not routinely required)\nSetting up alignment\n\t\nPipette 10 µL of free Cy3B dye (~100 nM) onto the microscope and focus as described in steps 4.3-4.5 below.\n\t\tNOTE: Another donor dye with some leakage into the acceptor channel would also work.\nOpen the Alignment tab in smOTTER, lower the laser power, and alter the y-axis scale until readout is seen from the detectors.\n\t\tNOTE: The goal here is to increase the signal, so the scale may need to be changed again after the signal increases.\nUnscrew the four screws at the front of the smfBox and remove the front panel.\nPinhole alignment\n\t\nTurn the x knob on the pinhole positioner while watching the signal on the Alignment tab, trying to increase the signal in green and red.",
    "Now turn the y knob to align the pinhole in the other direction.\nReturn to the x knob to check for any further increase in signal.\nPinhole-lens alignment\n\t\nTurn the lens x knob in one direction, this will decrease the signal.\nTurn the pinhole x knob in the same direction to increase the signal again.\nIf the new max signal is higher than before, continue to iteratively move both the pinhole and lens in that direction. If it is lower than before, iteratively move in the opposite direction.\nRepeat above for y.\nAPD lens alignment\n\t\nStarting with the green APD, move the x knob until the green signal is at a maximum.\nRepeat for the y knob.\nReturn to the x knob, move back and forth to find the threshold points where the signal begins to fall, and leave it at a position halfway between these two points.\nRepeat for the x knob.\nRepeat the above steps for the red APD lens, watching the red signal.\nPlace the front panel back on the smfBox and replace the screws.\n\tNOTE: Perform the above alignment monthyl, and as a precautionary measure if it is suspected that the microscope has developed an alignment fault between measurements.\n4. Measurement-data acquisition\nFor the first sample, clean the stage with lens cleaning tissue soaked in methanol; wipe gently across the objective from one end to the other.\nApply 3-4 drops of immersion oil for microscopy onto the center of the objective; replenish as needed between samples.\nSample preparation\n\t\nPipette 10 µL of sample (first use Type I ultrapure water) onto the center of a clean cover glass.\nCarefully place the cover glass onto the objective lens lowering it at an angle to the oil to prevent trapping air bubbles between the cover glass and the objective.",
    "NOTE: If necessary, slide cover glass around to push air bubbles in the oil away from the focal point.\nTo perform alternating-laser excitation (ALEX) experiments configure the laser in the laser duty cycles panel as follows.\n\t\nDonor (green laser) 0 off, 45 on, 55 off\nAcceptor (red laser) 50 off, 45 on, 5 off\nALEX period (µs): 100\nClick on the Z focus tab in the ribbon; in the acquisition panel, switch the lasers to Live and start the camera; adjust the exposure so that a bright spot appears centrally surrounded by black.\n\t​NOTE: The camera captures light reflected by the glass/water interface between the coverslip and the sample and the visible circle of light is at its smallest diameter when the focal point is at this interface. It is therefore necessary to start below this interface, increase the z-height to the interface, and then slightly further to focus above the coverslip and in the sample being measured.\n\t\nStarting from a low Z position, increase the height until the bright spot reaches its minimal size, then raise the height further by up to 20 µm to focus the laser above the oil and cover glass and in the sample.\nStop the camera once in focus.\nTo confirm that the setup has been performed appropriately, monitor the trace of Type I ultrapure water to see no fluorescence signals; repeat confirmation of purity for the buffers in which samples are prepared.\nCarefully remove the cover glass with rubber-ended tweezers to avoid damaging objective, then place the sample of interest prepared as above onto the objective. Replenish the immersion oil as necessary to maintain a uniform area of contact between cover glass and objective (special attention paid to sample's contact area on cover glass and focal area of objective)\nConcentration bingo",
    "To ensure single-molecule data is obtained, samples need to be at a concentration at which 1-5 bursts per second are observed in the live trace panel of smOTTER (this minimizes the chance of more than one molecule being present in the detection volume at once). Take the measurements when the appropriate concentration has been determined.\nTo prevent evaporation during long experiments, prepare an airtight sample chamber. Press the silicone isolators (8-9 mm diameter hole) down onto the center of a cover glass (colored-in with a pipette tip). Then, carefully pipette a sample into the center, avoiding any contact with the silicone. Then, place a second cover glass on top and press to form a seal.\nCheck the live stoichiometry vs FRET efficiency (ES) histogram to see if the sample is behaving as expected, i.e., expected FRET efficiency and reasonable stoichiometry (~0.5).\nWhen the sample is ready, enter the details for the experiment into the save settings panel. Choose an appropriate directory and filename by clicking on the ellipsis icon (files saved in hdf5/h5 format) in the save settings panel.\n\t\nEnter information for sample name, sample details, donor and acceptor labels, buffer, donor and acceptor excitation wavelengths, detection wavelengths and laser power, and user and user affiliation.\nReturn to the live trace tab in the ribbon, and in the acquisition panel enter experiment length (in minutes), select an appropriate save interval to mitigate potential data-loss in case of an error. Select Save Laser Powers, if required.\nPress Start to take the data.\n\t​NOTE: To enable accurate FRET determination, at least two samples will need to be measured containing the same donor and acceptor dyes, but with sufficiently different FRET efficiencies.\n5. Analysis/software 2\nLaunch Jupyter notebook with the FRETBursts python package (setup instructions can be found here: https://craggslab.github.io/smfBox/anasoftware.html)",
    "If correction for absolute FRET efficiencies is not needed (i.e., only relative changes in FRET are sufficient for the measurement) launch Jupyter notebook FRET Analysis 1.4 Uncorrected.ipynb. Use this to export figures or data as csv files for further analysis or plotting in other software.\n\tNOTE: Each notebook contains detailed instructions to guide the user through the analysis procedures. For a more detailed discussion of analysis procedures, including burst search algorithms, background correction, and all correction parameters see23,25.\nIf correction for absolute FRET efficiencies is needed, begin by calculating the crosstalk parameters alpha (leakage of donor emission into the acceptor channel) and delta (proportion of direct excitation of the acceptor under donor excitation).\n\t\nFirst launch Jupyter notebook Correction Factor Finder Alpha-Delta.ipynb and determine the alpha and delta parameters.\n\t\tNOTE: If these are inconsistent between samples, the microscope may have developed an alignment problem between measurements or the spectra of the dyes differs between samples.\nIf the alpha and delta parameters are consistent, launch Jupyter notebook Correction Factor Finder Gamma-Beta.ipynb to determine the gamma and beta parameters (which account for differences in excitation and detection efficiencies between the dyes).\n\t\t​NOTE: If the gamma and beta plot does not fit well, the microscope may have developed an alignment problem between measurements, or the quantum yields, or the extinction coefficients of the dyes differs between samples.\nWith the four crosstalk parameters determined, these factors may be used in the FRET Analysis 1.4 Corrected.ipynb Jupyter notebook to determine absolute FRET efficiencies.\n6. Troubleshooting\nIf all signals are low or counts per burst are lower than expected (this is dye dependant-but for ATTO-550 and ATTO-647N on the smfBox typical values are between 50 and 100 counts per ms during a single-molecule burst), realign the smfBox.\nBridge between doubly and singly labeled populations on ES histogram.",
    "NOTE: This can be caused either by working at too high a concentration (remedy this by diluting the sample), or by photobleaching, which can be caused by using too high a laser power (remedy this by reducing laser power).\nIf the burst rate falls throughout the experiment (fluorescently labeled molecules are likely adhering to the glass coverslip), use an increased concentration of BSA to rectify.\nIf the burst rate increases throughout the experiment (sample is likely evaporating), prepare an air-tight sample chamber as described above.\nIf the signal crashes to zero during alignment (the software is likely being overwhelmed by signal from the detectors), lower the laser power or use a more dilute alignment sample.\nIf Z-focus shows concentric rings (can happen if multiple coverslips have been placed on the objective), check for multiple coverslips on the objective.\nIf the sample contains bright, long bursts of intermediate stoichiometries (caused by aggregated molecules), use detergents or modify sample purification protocols.\n\tNOTE: Getting a clean buffer can be an issue, as some buffer components will often contain very small amounts of moderately fluorescent contaminants which are enough to present as single color bursts on the time trace. If there is too much of this in the buffer, then it can coincide with sample bursts and change the FRET efficiency or stoichiometry being measured. BSA in particular can often be problematic in this regard, so it is helpful to expose a stock BSA solution to a strong light source to photobleach the contaminants."
