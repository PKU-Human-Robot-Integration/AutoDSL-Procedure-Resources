    "1. Prearrangements\nStart Ponemah 6.42 software, and confirm the username and serial number of the software license on the following screen by clicking on Continue.\nLoad the experiment containing the ECG of interest\n\t\nIf Ponemah is started for the first time, note that the Ponemah Get Started dialog opens, offering three options: 1) Create Experiment, 2) Load Experiment, 3) Import Experiment.\n\t\t\nSelect Load Experiment to open a file. Once the Browse for Folder dialog opens, select the experiment file with the extension (\".PnmExp\"), and load the file by clicking on Open.\nTo open a data set recorded in Ponemah 5.x or Dataquest ART, use the Import Experiment function.\n\t\t\tNOTE: If the software is reopened, the last experiment is loaded automatically within the main window for further review. In the menu under Experiment, the same three options as in the Ponemah Get Started dialog are offered: 1) Create Experiment, 2) Open Experiment, 3) Import Experiment.\nClick on Actions / Start Review from the toolbar, and go to the Load Review Data dialog box, which provides an overview of all the mice subjects and the respective signals recorded within the loaded experiment (Figure 1A).\n\t\nSelect the recording referring to the mouse that will be analyzed by clicking on the checkbox next to the mouse number in the left panel Subjects.\nSelect the checkbox next to ECG in the middle panel Signal Types.",
    "Determine the duration of the signal that will be analyzed with the extreme right panel Time Range. Observe the following three options: Entire Experiment, which will load all the ECG data from the selected mouse; Parser Segments, which will only load data contained within Parser Segments added during a previous review session; Time Range, which allows the loading of a specific time range either by entering a specific start and end date or by entering a time duration.\nTo save the selection, use the Loading Definitions dialog in the upper left corner, which also allows loading of previously saved selections.\n\t\tNOTE: The size of the selected data will be indicated by either a green or red bar based on the file size in the upper right corner under Data Size. Currently, the software allows loading up to 3 GB of data for Review; 3 GB data can be equivalent to a continuous 24 h recording of 3-4 days.\nClick on OK to load the selected data set into Review.\nAfter clicking OK, observe that the Ponemah Review window opens along with several separate windows. Although the Events and Parameters windows are opened and shown by default, manually select other necessary windows based on graphs of interest under the Graphs/Graph Setup toolbar.\n\tNOTE: If Events and Parameters do not open by default, they can be activated by Window/Parameters and Window/Events.\n\t\nMake note of the Graph Setup dialog, which allows setting up to 16 graphical windows providing both raw data (e.g., ECG signals) and derived parameters (e.g., XY loop) (Figure 1B).",
    "Select the Enable Page checkbox to show the ECG tracing. In the list below, choose the line including the desired mouse (under Subject) and data type (under Presentation) by clicking on the respective checkbox on the left. Use the following settings: Type, Primary; Label, up to 11 characters displayed in the title bar of the window; Time, 0:00:00:01 indicating seconds as the unit used.\n\t\t\nEnter the appropriate information in the Label, Unit, Low, and High text boxes.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: Enable two more pages, Heart Rate Trend and Template, which are helpful for the analysis of basic ECG parameters and for arrhythmia detection.\nIn the Heart Rate Trend page, activate another graph page and define as a trend to plot the heart rate (HR) over time. Use the following settings to plot the HR for the entire data that are loaded in Review Type, Trend; Input, ECG; Presentation, HR; Label, HR Trend; Unit, bpm; Low: 50; High: 1000.\n\t\t​NOTE: Templates are ECG cycles with accurately placed marks that can be used as representative ECG cycles for pattern recognition analysis. They allow the selection of a small number of representative cycles and the matching of these templates to the entire ECG, thereby annotating all other cycles accordingly.\n\t\t\nTo use the template function, create a Template Library (a file in which the Templates are stored) for each subject. Do so by selecting the Template Setup/Template library option (Figure 2A).\nSelect New… from the dropdown menu under Template library to create a new Template Library.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: There are a few more options in the dropdown menu: No Binding disassociates any previous configured Template Library from the Subject. Browse associates an existing Template Library that was configured during a previous Review session.",
    "Next, configure a Template graph, select Setup/Experiment Setup/Graph Setup, and select a Page to use as a Template graph page. Check the Enable Page check box, select Template for the Type, and ensure that Input reflects the users Subject/Channel selection. Type the appropriate information in the Label, Unit, Low, and High text boxes, and click on the OK button to display a graphic window for each graphic page that was configured under Graphic Setup as shown in Figure 2B.\n\t\t\tNOTE: A graph setup page for Template settings will appear as shown in Figure 2B. According to the page selected in the graph setup dialog, the title bars of the windows are labeled from pages 1 - 16, based on the number of pages enabled (examples for pages 1, 2, 3 are shown in Figure 3A, Figure 3B, and Figure 3C, respectively).\nMake some important adjustments in the ECG tracing window (Figure 3A).\n\t\nAdjust the Y-axis representing the ECG amplitude by double-clicking within the ECG tracing window to select Scaling. Here, select Autoscale or adjust manually by using High Axis Value and Low Axis Value.\nTo adjust the X-axis representing the time, click on the respective toolbar icons: Zoom In to expand the time span (i.e., fewer QRS complexes are shown), Zoom Out to compress the time span (i.e., more QRS complexes are shown).\nTo show DT (Delta Time) and RT (Real Time) in the lower left corner, left-click on the ECG tracing with the cursor (a vertical black line) to position and see real-time information at the cursor location under RT.",
    "As DT shows a time interval of the user's choice, right-click on the window, to both position the cursor and to select Reset Delta Time within the dialog that appears. Left-click to another position within the ECG tracing to measure the time interval between the selected time intervals shown as Delta Time (DT).\nEnsure that each segment of the tracing (P, Q, R, T wave) is recognized and correctly annotated for the ECG analysis. To achieve this, define and analyze Attributes by a right click within the ECG window, and click on the Analyze/Attributes option.\n\tNOTE: The ECG Analysis Attributes dialog opens as shown in Figure 4A. At the top of this dialog, several options (QRS, PT, Advanced, Noise, Marks, Notes, Precision) allow for the adjustment to various settings (explained below).\n\t\nClick on the QRS tab to adjust R and QS identification.\n\t\t\nQRS Detection Threshold: Apply the entered percentage to the largest derivative peak illustrated within the waveform window.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Define an optimal value to eliminate undersensing (i.e., some R waves may be not detected) and oversensing of peaks (i.e., other peaks, such as T waves, may be misinterpreted as R waves). The threshold (region highlighted in pink in Figure 4A) should intersect with the derivative of the ECG. Ideally, the attribute values, which help to identify QRS complexes and to distinguish between clear cycles and noise events, should be maintained at constant (or almost constant) levels between all recordings from one project to allow comparability over different animals per project. After establishing optimal values, maintain the attribute settings for the entire recording.\nMin R Deflection: Ensure that the R amplitude change (based on minimum/maximum signal values and not isoelectric levels) exceeds this value before annotating it as an R wave.",
    "NOTE: Min R Deflection should be ideally higher than noise and lower than the expected deflection of R wave. A low value may result in noise sensing and therefore oversensing, a high value may result in undersensing.\nMaximum Heart Rate: Ensure that the value entered here is higher than the maximum heart rate expected.\n\t\t\tNOTE: A low value may result in undersensing, a high value may result oversensing as noisy cycles have a greater chance of getting marked as R waves.\nMinimum Heart Rate: Ensure that the value entered here is close to the lowest heart rate expected.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: Adjust heart rate limits for each recording individually depending on the signal amplitude and the degree of noise. Researchers must be aware that a wide range of heart rates may result in failure to detect arrhythmias; a narrow range of heart rate, however, may result in extreme oversensing (e.g., thousands of episodes identified as \"tachycardia\", which no longer allow a meaningful analysis).\nAdjust Peak Bias to detect positive and negative R waves.\n\t\t\tNOTE: A positive Peak Bias favors detection of positive R waves; a negative Peak Bias favors detection of negative R waves.\nIntra Cardiac: Use this setting in cases where the P wave rapidly changes and when its derivative may exceed the derivative of the R wave resulting in false annotation of the P wave as an R wave.\nBaseline Recovery Threshold: Set this value, which represents a \"blanking period\" around the R wave, to prevent the software from searching for Q or S waves as small artefacts might otherwise result in false annotation of Q or S waves.",
    "​NOTE: For example, a value of 0 will result in searching for Q/S waves from the peak of the R wave, a value of 70 will result in searching for Q/S waves only after 70% recovery of the R wave height.\nClick on the PT tab for settings for the detection of P and T waves.\n\t\t\nMax QT interval: Adjust this interval to define the interval at which a detected T wave will be accepted.\nT window from S: Adjust this setting to define the search interval for a T wave starting from S wave to the right.\nT window from R: Adjust this setting to define the search interval for a T wave starting from R wave to the left.\nP Window from R: Adjust this setting to define the search interval for a P wave starting from R wave to the left.\nT Direction: Set Both as default to search for both positive and negative T waves as this setting defines if only positive, only negative, or both positive/negative T waves are searched.\nP Direction: Set Both as default to search for both positive and negative P waves as this setting defines if only positive, only negative, or both positive/negative P waves are searched.\nP Placement: Adjust this setting to shift the P mark towards (high value) or away (low value) from the peak of the P wave.\nT Placement: Adjust this setting to shift the T mark towards (high value) or away (low value) from the peak of the P wave.\nAlternate End of T: Adjust this setting to search for an alternative T wave beyond the first potential T wave. Enter a lower value to select the first T wave and a higher value to select the alternative T wave.",
    "Peak Sensitivity: Adjust this parameter to eliminate small peaks when identifying P and T waves. Use this in conjunction with Peak Identification.\n\t\t\tNOTE: A value of 0 defines maximum sensitivity; a value of 100 defines minimal sensitivity. The minimal Peak Sensitivity value depends on the quality of the signal. If the level of noise is low and/or the P and T waves are clearly distinguishable, these waves are well triggered, even when the Peak Sensitivity is 100. Generally, the Peak Sensitivity and Peak Identification do not need adjustment unless the signal is noisy, and the analysis algorithm is encountering issues with the detection of P and T waves. If so, the best results are achieved by adjusting the parameter in steps of 25.\nPeak Identification: Use this parameter in conjunction with Peak Sensitivity to define the threshold for the identification of P and T waves. Lower up to 0 Peak Sensitivity if small P/T waves are not identified. If P/T waves are not identified even when Peak Sensitivity is set to 0, then lower Peak Identification, adjust in steps of 25.\nHigh ST Segment: Use this attribute if the T wave is very close to the QRS complex resulting in a high ST segment.\n\t\t\tNOTE: As mice lack a distinct ST segment, with a T wave occurring directly after the QRS complex, this setting should not be used in mice.\nClick on the Advanced Attributes tab to set low/high pass filters, to define the J point to determine ST elevation/depression (not useful in mice), to set correction factors for QT measurement, and to define arrhythmic QRS complexes by the height of the R wave and the duration of the QRS complex.",
    "​NOTE: Use the default settings predefined within this tab. If the signal is affected, e.g., by electromagnetic interference, adjust the filter settings here, which may help to improve signal quality. Definition of \"arrhythmic QRS complexes\" does not improve the accuracy to detect premature ventricular capture beats over the method suggested here (each PVC will also result in a pause and is therefore detected by this approach). The other settings are only relevant to very specific research questions and are therefore not described in detail here.\nUse the Noise Tab to adjust attributes to identify noise.\n\t\t\nClick on the checkbox Enable Noise Detection to identify noise, and set Bad Data Marks.\nClick on the checkbox Enable Dropout Detection to set Bad Data Marks around data defined as dropout based on the maximum/minimum signal value. Adjust Min Good Data Time, which defines the time between two dropout segments also considered as dropout even if the signal is good.\nAdjust the Bad Data Threshold to define the level of noise above which the ECG signal cannot be properly analyzed.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This noisy segment of data will be included between Bad Data Marks and will not be analyzed. No ECG-derived parameters will be reported for these segments of \"bad data\".\nSpecify the Min Noise Heart Rate below which heart rates are considered as noise.\nUse the Marks tab to turn on and off validation marks.\n\t\t​NOTE: It is recommended to always turn on Mark Cycle Numbers, which will add a continuous number to each R wave identified. This will help to navigate through the ECG recording.\nUse the Notes tab to enter notes that will appear in the experimental log file.\nUse the Precision tab to define the precision at which parameters are reported.",
    "Set attributes and click on Recalculate to see the effects of the adjustments made in the Waveform window as a preview.\nIf (in an ideal situation) all ECG waves are correctly annotated, click on OK to confirm the attributes settings, which opens the Effects and Scope of Changes dialog. To analyze the ECG, click on the checkboxes Reanalyze the channel and The entire channel and confirm by clicking on OK.\nDepending on the input settings in the Attributes dialog, make a note of the validation marks that are displayed in the ECG tracing. Go through the recording manually, and check if validation marks as well as bad data marks are set correctly. Use Data Insights for checking the R marks and ECG Pro for checking P and T marks.\n\t\nIf many marks are incorrect, modify Attributes and reanalyze the recording.\n\t\tNOTE: Specific settings can be applied to specific segments of data when the ECG morphology is different from the rest of the recording. The Ponemah software manual provides standard values for ECG Analysis Attributes for different species under Ponemah Software Manual/ Analysis Modules / Electrocardiogram / Attributes Dialog. To start with, these values can be used and then adjusted manually, until enough or (in an ideal situation) all ECG waves are marked.\nPerform manual clean-up if only a few marks are incorrect. Move each validation mark (except for R wave marks) to the correct position by left-clicking, holding, and moving the respective mark. Right-click within the ECG recording to add additional validation marks or mark arrhythmic R waves. Right-click on an incorrectly set mark to delete this mark.",
    "Click on Actions/Logging Rate (or press F8) to set the Logging Rate, which defines how often derived data is logged to the Derived Parameter List View or plotted to graphs that use the derived parameters. For analysis of basic ECG Parameters and Arrythmia, use Epoch 1 as the standard setting, which sets logging rate to each cycle.\n\t​NOTE: The Logging Rate can be augmented at any time during Acquisition or Review.\n2. Analysis of basic ECG parameters\nNOTE: In addition to validation/bad data marks, the software also automatically measures and calculates a large variety of derived parameters which are then reported in the Derived Parameter List.\nClick on Subject Setup/Channel Details to select any of the derived parameters.\n\tNOTE: In the Derived Parameter List, each parameter is linked to the number of the respective QRS complex.\n\t\nDouble-click on a row in the Parameter table to display the corresponding ECG cycles in the center of the primary ECG graphic window and easily find and visualize the morphology of the ECG cycles that correspond to the derived parameters in the selected raw data.\n\t\tNOTE: It is possible to synchronize in both directions: from the table to the graphic and also from the graphic to the table. When the logging rate is 1 Epoch, the synchronization is done for each individual cycle. This is easy to check from the cycle number (NUM) in the Parameters table and in the graphic. Especially in long recordings, this synchronization feature between the tables and the graphics is very useful.",
    "To account for the circadian alteration in ECG parameters, rather than calculating mean values of ECG parameters over a long period, analyze a resting ECG similar to that in humans to obtain basic ECG parameters such as resting heart rate, P wave duration, PR interval, QRS duration, or QT/QTc interval. Analyze 20 consecutive QRS complexes in the mouse as \"resting ECG equivalent\".\n\tNOTE: In humans, a resting ECG is recorded over 10 s at a normal heart rate of 50-100 /min. This ECG includes 8 to 17 QRS complexes.\n\t\nAs mice follow a circadian rhythm, analyze two resting ECGs per day, one at day time and one at night time to control for circadian effects. Select suitable times depending on the light on/off cycle in the animal facility, e.g., 12 AM/PM.\nSelect a section of the ECG with good signal quality and stable heart rate in the HR Trend graph within a defined reasonable timeframe around this time point (e.g., ±30 min).\nConfirm the accuracy of the validation marks or adjust manually in 20 consecutive QRS complexes. Add missing validation marks.\nFor further calculations and visualizations, mark the lines containing the values of these 20 consecutive QRS complexes in the Derived Parameter List, and copy to a spreadsheet or statistics software.\n3. Arrhythmia detection using pattern recognition (ECG PRO module)",
    "NOTE: Ponemah's ECG PRO module uses selected QRS complexes as templates for further analysis. The ECG patterns of the templates are compared to all QRS complexes within the recording to calculate the percentage of similarity (\"match\") and to recognize arrhythmias (e.g., atrial or ventricular premature capture beats). The number of QRS complexes needed to be marked depends on the variability of the QRS-amplitude within the recording. In certain cases, selecting and marking one QRS complex gives a similarity of 80 percent with the respective recording, marking the majority of QRS cycles. However, this is an ideal case and during analysis, the number of QRS complexes that need to be marked as templates is usually higher.\nMark QRS complexes as templates until at least a match of 80 percent or higher is achieved. Furthermore, use template matching to mark P, Q, S, and T waves if these are not or inadequately recognized after attributes settings (section 1.7).\n\tNOTE: R marks must be identified for cycles prior to analyzing with ECG PRO. This requires that either the R marks are preserved from acquisition or the attribute-based analysis has to be executed prior to performing ECG PRO analysis. The other marks (P, Q, S, and T) need not be present for ECG PRO analysis.\nAfter completing Template setup (as described in 1.4.4), select a desired ECG wave (with marked R). If necessary, adjust the Validation Marks to accurately reflect the appropriate positions of the ECG Marks of interest. Right-click on the cycle in the Display Panel in the ECG Tracing window, select Add Cycle and Analyze [Single Template], and make a note of the cycle that appears in the Template window.",
    "NOTE: An Autoscale may need to be performed for both the X- and Y-axes to see the full Cycle. ECG Marks may be moved within the Template graph page.\nRight-click on the Display Panel of the Template window, and select Add Cycle and Analyze (Single Template) to launch the Template Analysis dialog shown in Figure 4B. Select the desired Template Match Region to which all other ECG cycles will be compared. If needed, change the advanced settings for the desired Match Region.\n\tNOTE: Multiple Match Regions may be selected depending on the desired output from the analysis (the Derived Parameters of interest).\nSelect a Data Range on which to perform the analysis.\n\tNOTE: The Data Range allows the reanalysis of the data visible in the graph, the data from the left edge of the visible region from the primary graph forward to the end of the loaded data set, the data within the Parser Segments, or the entire channel.\nSelect the type of Cycles to Analyze.\n\t\nSelect All to compare the Template Library to All cycles with a valid R mark.\nSelect Unmatched to skip previously matched cycles and compare the Template Library to only the unmatched cycles.\n\t\tNOTE: This is useful when adding additional Templates to the Template Library for greater match coverage, as the processing time is shorter.\nSelect the desired Match Method. When selecting multiple Match Regions and Whole Cycle, use the Template that, on average, matches the cycle best to place the marks. When Region is used, for the best match for each Match Region, place the marks from different Templates.\nSelect OK to execute the analysis.",
    "NOTE: Additional Template Cycles can be added to the Template Library, and the Template analysis can be re-run until the desired Dialog Match % is achieved. Doing this readjusts the waves in all the cycles that match the template.\nSave Template Libraries through Templates/Save when the Review Session is closed.\nTo detect arrhythmia using template match, tag templates that have morphology different from that of the physiological waves after doing the template match (as described in section 3.1.) by right-clicking and selecting Add Template Tag, and select a type of cycle (e.g., atrial ectopic, ventricular ectopic). Analyze these Tags using Data Insights.\n4. Arrhythmia detection: a simplified manual approach using Data Insights\nNOTE: For arrhythmia analysis, a correct annotation of P and R waves is necessary. However, even if clear P waves are visible within the ECG tracing, these P waves are sometimes not adequately identified even after adjusting the Attribute settings. As R waves are usually adequately recognized and annotated, a practical approach for further arrhythmia analysis using Data Insights is proposed below. For a general overview on arrhythmia detection using Data Insights and its predefined species-specific searches, the interested reader may be referred to Mehendale et al.13.\nOpen Data Insights by clicking on Experiment/Data Insights.\n\t\nObserve the Search panel at the top of the Data Insights dialog.\n\t\tNOTE: On the left of the panel, it shows which search rule is applied to which channel/subject and the number of hits using this search rule. In the middle, all the search rules are listed, and on the right, the specific definition of a selected search rule is displayed.\nObserve the Results panel displayed in the lower part of the Search panel.",
    "​NOTE: For each search hit, the corresponding ECG section is shown (top) along with a table indicating the time within the recording and the results of each search parameter (middle).\nObserve the number of search hits displayed as a histogram in the bottom of the panel.\nGiven that the normal heart rate of a mouse is 500-724/min14, define a search rule bradycardia to detect bradycardia.\n\t\nRight-click within the search list, and select Create New Search to open the Search Entry dialog.\nRight-click within the white box, and select Add New Clause.\nUsing the dropdown menus and text fields, define the search rule Bradycardia-single as Value(HR cyc0) < 500. Click on OK to add this search rule to the list. Apply this search rule by clicking and dragging it to the channel of interest on the left.\n\t\tNOTE: The search rule Bradycardia-single identifies every individual RR interval that is longer than 120 ms (= less than 500/min.).\nAs bradycardia requires more than one long RR interval, define an additional search rule Bradycardia as Series(Bradycardia-single, 1)>=20. Click on OK to add this search rule to the list. Apply this search rule by clicking and dragging it to the channel of interest on the left.\n\t\tNOTE: In the Results panel, each section within the ECG recording consisting of at least 20 QRS complexes with a heart rate less than 500/min. is displayed.\nTo confirm bradycardia and to reject false results (e.g., due to R wave undersensing), review each result manually. Left-click on the waveform, and press STRG+R to reject the selected result, which will disappear from the list of results.\n\t\tNOTE: The rejected results are saved under Result/Rejects.\nTo detect tachycardia, define a search rule tachycardia.\n\t\nRight-click within the search list, and select Create New Search to open the Search Entry dialog.",
    "Right-click within the white box, and select Add New Clause.\nUsing the dropdown menus and text fields, define the search rule Tachycardia-single as Value(HR cyc0)>724. Click on OK to add this search rule to the list.

Click on OK to add this search rule to the list. Apply this search rule by clicking and dragging it to the channel of interest on the left.\n\t\tNOTE: The Results panel displays each section within the ECG recording consisting of at least 20 QRS complexes with a heart rate of more than 724/min.\nTo confirm tachycardia and to reject false results (e.g., due to R wave oversensing), review each result manually. Left-click on the waveform and use the shortcut STRG+R to reject the selected result, which will disappear from the list of results.\nTo detect sinoatrial and atrioventricular blocks, define a search rule Pause.\n\t\nRight-click within the search list, and select Create New Search to open the Search Entry dialog.\nRight-click within the white panel, and select Add New Clause.\nUsing the dropdown menus and text fields, define the search rule Pause as Value(RR-Icyc0)>300. Click on OK to add this search rule to the list.
