    "Note: Working with liquid nitrogen and liquid ethane/propane mixture is potentially dangerous. Personal protective equipment should be used. Vitrification by plunge-freezingNote: Standard protocols can be used for plunge-freezing cells (e.g. Iancu et al., 2006). For proper vitrification (freezing in non-crystalline ice) and cell density, parameters must be optimized for each specific cell type.Cell concentration is determined by counting using a hemocytometer.          (C. reinhardtii cells are fixed with Lugol’s iodine solution for the          counting process in order to stop cell motility. A Lugol’s solution to          cell culture of ratio 1:10 is sufficient.)The concentration of          the cells is diluted to 200-750 cells/μl in fresh TAP for the  C.            reinhardtii  wild-type strain, 500-4,000 cells/μl in fresh TAP for the  C.            reinhardtii  mat3-4 strain, and 10,000-15,000 cells/μl for S. cerevisiae cells in YPD medium.The carbon-coated 200-mesh copper TEM grids          placed carbon side up on a glass slide are glow discharged by 30 sec          plasma cleaning. The slide is then stored in a glass petri dish until          plunging, which should proceed immediately. The cells are plunge-frozen using the Vitrobot: The Vitrobot is set to 90% humidity, blot force 10, 7 to 10 sec blot              time, room temperature (C. reinhardtii cells) or 27 °C (S. cerevisiae cells).3.5 μl of the diluted cell culture is pipetted onto TEM grids inside the Vitrobot. The grids are blotted from the reverse side using Teflon sheets on              both sides and filter paper on the backside. Then they are immediately              plunged into the liquid ethane/propane mixture at liquid nitrogen              temperature. The plunge-frozen grids are then stored in sealed boxes under liquid nitrogen until used.Sample thinning using cryo-FIB milling Cooling the FIB system from room temperature to cryo conditions.",
    "Before starting the cooling, the vacuum in the FIB chamber and in the              prep-chamber must be lower than 4 x 10-6 mbar to avoid contamination              from water vapor. The N2 gas pipeline between the liquid nitrogen Dewar and the FIB chamber (vacuum isolated line) is pumped to 2 x 10-2 mbar.The nitrogen gas flow for the stage and anti-contaminator are              adjusted to 3.8 L/min and 4.2 L/min, respectively. These values ensure              that temperatures of 182 °C and 192 °C are reached after cooling,              respectively.The cooling is started by slowly inserting the cooling rod into the liquid nitrogen Dewar.Sample clipping and loading the AutoGrids into the FIB shuttle. Note: Clipping and loading is started when the cryo-stage and            anti-contaminator reach temperatures below -160 °C. Using a surgical            mask can minimize water vapor contamination of the work area. The shuttle and the clipping support base are placed into the loading box (Figure 2). The loading box is filled with liquid nitrogen. After boiling has finished, the double wall tank is filled with              liquid nitrogen by slightly tilting the loading box (Figure 2). The sample boxes from the storage Dewar are transferred into the loading              box and opened there. Transfer time should be minimized to avoid              contamination of the sample.All tools that will contact the TEM grids are pre-cooled by liquid nitrogen in the loading box immediately before use.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150904/20150904222430_9139.jpgFigure 2.

The AutoGrid notch (6) aids          the fast and easy handling of Autogrids under liquid nitrogen. The          clipping tool (1) and tweezers can be cooled in the round bore (7).",
    "The          shuttle (3) (in loading position), sample storage box (4) and clipping          metal support (5) are immersed under liquid nitrogen. The              AutoGrid is placed into the clipping metal support with the flat side              facing down. It must be centered properly. The TEM grid is removed from              the sample box and placed into the AutoGrid with cells facing down. The              grid is then clipped into the AutoGrid with a clip ring using the              clipping tool (Figure 1b).As the shuttle has space for two AutoGrids, step B2f) is repeated for the second AutoGrid.The AutoGrids are loaded into the shuttle and oriented such that the              cutouts are facing up (Figure 1c). The shuttle is then flipped back              into the transfer position.Shuttle transfer onto the FIB cryo-stage.The temperatures of the cryo-stage and anti-contaminator should be              between -194 °C and -165 °C. The temperature of the anti-contaminator              should be lower than the temperature of the cryo-stage.The stage is moved to the transfer position.The loading box (Figure 3c) is placed onto the pumping station (Figure 3a) and covered.The transfer unit (Figure 3b) is placed onto the cover of the              loading box, and the transfer unit’s insertion rod is attached to the              shuttle.The pumping of the transfer unit and loading box is              started. After one minute, the shuttle is lifted out of the loading box              into the transfer unit. The transfer unit valve is closed, the pumping              is stopped and the loading station is vented (Figure 3d). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150904/20150904222502_1452.jpgFigure 3.

The small transfer chamber (3) is closed/opened using          the transfer unit valve (8).The transfer unit is attached to the airlock of the FIB (“prep chamber” connected to the turbo pump of the Quorum system).The airlock is pumped to the vacuum level required to safely open the airlock valves and the transfer unit valve.The shuttle is transferred onto the cryo-stage with the insertion rod.The insertion rod is detached from the shuttle and retracted, then              the airlock valves and the transfer unit valve are closed. The airlock              is vented and the transfer unit is removed.Lamella milling. Note: See Video 1 for an overview of the milling procedure. For help            with basic FIB operation, press the F1 key in the FIB software. Before starting the milling, the vacuum in the FIB chamber at cryo              condition must be lower than 2 x 10-6 mbar to avoid contamination from              water vapor.The FIB user interface of the FIB microscope is active.The column valves are opened and ion beam emission is started (“Beam on” or “Wake up” buttons are pressed).Electron and ion beams are in the operational state. Note: The following parameters enable rapid milling of the bulk                cellular material, followed by fine milling and polishing of the                lamella. The scanning parameters for the electron beam are set              to: 5.0 kV beam energy, 12 pA beam current, 1,024 x, 884 or 1,536 x              1,024 scan resolution, 1 µs dwell time. Scanning is started.Scan rotation for both beams is set to 180 degrees.Low magnification (70x) is set and the stage is moved to one of the two AutoGrids.",
    "The grid bar is scanned at increased zoom to adjust focus, astigmatism and other required alignments for the electron beam.The stage is linked to a focused working distance (“Link Z to FWD” button).The stage is moved to the eucentric height (coincidence point) of              the microscope (ion and electron beams display the same location).The stage rotation is adjusted to align the AutoGrid cutout with the              incident direction of the ion beam. This is achieved by facing the              cutout towards the bottom of the electron image (Figure 4a). Organometallic platinum deposition is performed on both AutoGrids using              the in situ gas injection system to protect the lamella surface and              reduce curtaining effects (protocol adapted from Hayles et al., 2007):Stage parameters are set to 0° tilt and 3 mm below eucentric height.The stage is adjusted such that the AutoGrid faces the gas                  injection system (GIS). For this, a relative stage rotation of 180° is                  performed using the compucentric rotation. The AutoGrid is then centered                  at the GIS position in the electron image (Figure 4b).The GIS temperature is set to 26 °C.The GIS needle is inserted and opened for 4 to 8 sec.The GIS needle is retracted.The stage is moved back to the initial position where it was before the procedure.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150904/20150904222634_2477.jpg Figure 4.

Cryo-FIB milling of a vitreous Chlamydomonas cell The stage is tilted to the milling position with the ion beam almost              parallel (typically 6 to 12°) to the grid surface. For a shuttle that              is 7° pre-tilted, and a desired milling angle of 10° with respect to TEM              grid surface, the stage is tilted to 17°.The ion beam              parameters are set to: 30.0 kV beam energy, 10 pA beam current, 1,024 x              884 or 1,536 x 1,024 scan resolution, 1 µs dwell time.The focus and astigmatism of the ion beam are adjusted while scanning the grid bar at increased zoom.A target cell is localized in both electron and ion beam images (Figure 4c-e).  Note: The three meshes closest to the edge of the TEM grid are often                not accessible in the TEM microscope. Generally, central meshes are                preferred. The eucentric height is adjusted using stage movement              in the z-direction so that the ion beam and the electron beam show the              same sample surface. Note: The eucentric height must be separately adjusted for each milling position. Two parallel rectangular standard milling patterns are drawn (Figure              4e). With pre-tilt correction disabled, the size of the pattern is              approximately 10 x 6 µm and the distance between the patterns is more              than 5 µm. The milling direction is set to top-to-bottom for one pattern              and to bottom-to-top for the other, so that the milling direction of              the pattern is always towards the lamella edge.",
    "The milling parameters              are set to: Ice material (or Si), 1 µs dwell time, 60% overlap.The ion beam current is changed to 0.3 nA, and a fast single scan is              taken (50 ns dwell time) to verify the proper milling position.The milling process is started. The milling is stopped as soon as the              material is completely removed, as observed by live imaging of the              scanned area.Iteratively, the beam current is reduced, pattern              heights on both sides are made slimmer (while keeping pattern widths              constant) and patterns are shifted closer to the lamella edge (Figure 4f              and Video 1). Typical steps for the beam current are 0.1 nA, 50 pA and              then 30 pA.At a sample thickness of about 500 nm, the final              milling is performed using 30 pA and optionally the              cleaning-cross-section pattern. The target lamella thickness is between              300 and 100 nm (Figure 4g). During this step, thickness is estimated              using electron images (Figure 4h-i).It is possible to prepare              multiple lamellas (~10) during one FIB session. For each new lamella,              first set the ion beam current back to 10 pA and then repeat steps              B4p-v).  Note: To minimize time-dependent ice contamination, it is                recommended to perform steps B4p-U at all sample locations first, then                afterwards perform step B4v for each lamella.  Shuttle transfer out of the FIBThe column valves are closed (“Beam on\\off” buttons, or “Sleep” button to end the FIB session).The stage is moved to the transfer position.The loading box is filled with liquid nitrogen and then placed onto the pumping station.The transfer unit is docked to the airlock of the FIB.The airlock is pumped to the vacuum level required to safely open              the airlock valves. The airlock valves and the transfer unit valve are              then opened.",
    "The shuttle is retrieved from the cryo-stage with              the insertion rod and retracted out of the FIB chamber into the transfer              unit.The airlock valves and the transfer unit valve are closed.The airlock is vented.The transfer unit is attached to the loading box.The loading station is pumped for 50 sec. Then the transfer unit              valve is opened, and the shuttle is inserted into the loading box with              the liquid nitrogen. The pumping is stopped and the loading station is              vented. The insertion rod is detached from the shuttle and the transfer unit is removed. AutoGrids are removed from the shuttle and stored under liquid nitrogen in storage boxes suitable for AutoGrids.Warming the FIB systemThe cooling rod is taken out of the liquid nitrogen Dewar.When the cryo-stage and anti-contaminator have reached a temperature of about 20 °C, the gas flow is decreased to 0.5 L/min.Cryo-ET The AutoGrid sample is loaded into the cryo-TEM microscope under cryo          conditions using the standard procedure (see FEI user manual). When          loading the AutoGrid, the AutoGrid cutout (and thus the milling          direction of the lamellas) must be aligned perpendicular to the tilt          axis of the stage.The lamella positions are localized using low magnification imaging.Tilt-series acquisition is performed using SerialEM software under          low-dose conditions (<100 e/Å2 cumulative dose). K2 images are          recorded at 2° tilt increments, with −4 μm to −8 μm defocus, typically          with pixel sizes of 3 to 5 Å."
