    "1. Description of Tracking Microscope\nAn agar plate is illuminated by a fiber light source and imaged with a camera. This system is mounted to an X,Y translation stage.    \nThe stage is moved by standard stepper motors, which are connected to a stepper motor controller.\nThe controller and camera are connected to the computer and controlled by custom programs written in LabVIEW. \nThe camera images the surface of an agar plate and identifies dark objects on a light background.\nThe image quality is adjusted so that computer program can quantify objects in real time. The gain, brightness, and shutter speed of the camera can be adjusted to provide a dark object on a white background.\nA calibration mark for the automatic calibration process is made by poking the agar surface with a worm pick. \nThe filtered, binary image which is used by the tracking program can be checked.\nThe software has an auto-calibration feature that calculates the calibration matrix by moving a test object a fixed distance. \nDistances in pixels is calibrated to steps taken by the stepper motor by the calibration matrix. \nAfter calibration, the system is ready to go and does not need to be recalibrated unless the magnification is changed or if the camera is repositioned. \n2. Preparing Tracking Plates and C. elegans for Tracking\nA copper ring is used to corral the worms and keep them from migrating to the edge of the plate. The copper provides a local chemical barrier and does not affect movement of the worm otherwise for the duration of the experiment (<1 hr). Heat the ring first by placing it on a heat block or equivalent.",
    "Place ring onto a fresh agar plate (1.7% Bacto Agar, 0.25% Bacto-Peptone, 0.3% NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer, 5 Î¼g/ml cholesterol) and press down slightly to embed it into the agar surface. \nPick L4 stage or young adult worms onto an agar plate filled with some NGM buffer (0.3% NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer) to wash them of food residue. Let the worms swim for a few minutes. \nCarefully place a single worm onto the tracking plate near the center of the ring. And then place the plate onto the worm tracker. \n3. Worm Tracking\nRun the LabVIEW program and select options if needed (location for images, types of images, measurements, camera settings).    \nUsing the joystick move the microscope until an image of the worm is in the field of view (computer screen). Press \"track\" to engage the tracking program. \nThe computer program actually measures the movements of a binary filtered images as shown and can make measurements on this image in real time \nAfter tracking a reconstruction of the global trajectory can be made from the stepper motor movements, while the local shape changes of the worm can be seen in detail. \n4. Data Analysis\nRun skeletonizing script (MATLAB) to parameterize the worm's shapes. (Figure 2)  \nCalculate eigenmodes of the skeletonized data. (Figure 3,4)    \nShow Figure 5. Read figure legend or representative results. \nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
