    "Day 1. Preparing strainsStreak a brain-heart infusion (BHI) agar plate containing 15 μg/ml neomycin with S. epidermidis RP62a (from here called ‘recipient’) from a -80 °C freezer stock to obtain single colonies. Incubate overnight at 37 °C.Note: In the same manner, streak out the negative control strain, S. epidermidis LAM104.Inoculate S. aureus carrying pG0400 (here onward called ‘donor’) from a freezer stock into 2 ml of tryptic soy broth (TSB) containing 5 μg/ml mupirocin. Incubate with shaking at 37 °C overnight.Note: While both S. epidermidis and S. aureus strains may be propagated in either BHI or TSB, the media indicated for each strain in this protocol are consistent with the growth media used in the original protocol demonstrating anti-plasmid immunity by the Type III-A CRISPR-Cas system in S. epidermidis RP62a (Marraffini and Sontheimer, 2008). Day 2. Growing colonies and filter matingAfter at least 16 h of incubation, large (> 1 mm in diameter) individual recipient colonies should be seen. Inoculate the entirety of 3 separate colonies into 15-ml centrifuge tubes containing 2 ml of BHI with 15 μg/ml neomycin.Notes: Also, inoculate any controls included in the experiment in triplicate.At the same time, add 50 μl of the overnight donor culture to 5 ml of TSB with 5 μg/ml mupirocin in a 15-ml centrifuge tube.Grow both the donor and recipient at 37 °C with shaking. Note: At the same time, place one BHI plate per 3 growing recipient cultures into the 30 °C incubator to pre-warm (see Note 4).After ~6 h, check the OD600 of both the recipient and donor strains.Add 900 μl of BHI broth into a spectrophotometer cuvette. Add 100 μl of growing culture of one of the recipient cultures. Mix well.After blanking with BHI, measure and record the OD600 of this 1:10 dilution of the growing culture.",
    "Repeat steps 2c i and 2c ii with the remaining recipient cultures. Repeat steps 2c i and 2c ii for the donor culture, substituting TSB for BHI.OD600 of all culture dilutions needs to be greater than 0.20 before proceeding. If the OD600 are not yet high enough, return to the shaker and let grow a while before checking the OD600 again.Calculate the amount of donor and recipient to combine to achieve a 1:4 ratio (recipients:donors) for filter mating, as in the example in Table 1.Note: Divide 200 by the measured OD600 found in step 2c for each culture. At an OD600 of 1, there are approximately 8 x 108 cfu/ml of the donor and 2 x 108 cfu/ml of the recipient. This calculation allows for standard numbers of donors (approximately 1.6 x 109 cfu) and recipients (approximately 4 x 108 cfu) to be combined in all samples that are tested.Table 1.

    "Into a 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tube, combine the above-calculated volume of the first, undiluted, recipient culture with the calculated volume of the undiluted donor.Note: Repeat until all donor-recipient pairs are combined into separate microcentrifuge tubes.Wash the combined cultures to remove the antibiotics by centrifuging the microcentrifuge tubes at 6,200 x g for 2 min in a table-top centrifuge. Pipette off the supernatant and resuspend the pellets in 1 ml of BHI without antibiotics. Repeat the centrifugation.Using sterile forceps, place one 0.45 μm membrane filter for each donor-recipient pair onto a BHI plate containing no antibiotics, with up to 3 filters on a single plate (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170501/20170501221457_9098.jpgFigure 1. Sample plate for filter mating showing a plate with three membrane filters covered in overnight growth in the center of each filterRemove the suspension from each microcentrifuge tube containing the donor and recipient combination. Resuspend the pellet in 100 μl of BHI broth and carefully pipet it onto the center of the membrane filter, being careful to not let any of the suspension fall off the membrane, as in Figure 1. It is crucial to keep all of the bacterial suspension on the filter, as this assay is quantitative and requires total recovery of all the cells.Repeat this with each microcentrifuge tube, placing the resuspension of each culture onto its own filter.Cover the plates and leave on the benchtop until the cell suspension has fully dried.Incubate the plates upside-down in a 30 °C incubator overnight.Day 3. Serially diluting and plating recipients and transconjugantsWarm one BHI agar plate containing neomycin (15 μg/ml) and one BHI agar plate containing both neomycin (15 μg/ml) and mupirocin (5 μg/ml) for each filter from the previous night.In 50-ml centrifuge tubes (one for each filter), add 3 ml of BHI broth without antibiotics.",
    "Using sterile forceps, pick each filter off the plate and place it into a 50-ml tube prepared in step 3b.Vortex each tube until the cells on the filter have been fully resuspended and no growth is visible on the filter.Serially dilute the cell suspensionInto each of the 8 tubes in a strip of PCR tubes, add 90 μl BHI broth.Remove 10 μl of the bacterial suspension from step 3d and add it to the first PCR strip tube, pipetting up and down repeatedly to resuspend (this is the 10-1 dilution).Using a new pipette tip, remove 10 μl from the 10-1 dilution and add it to the second PCR tube, pipetting up and down repeatedly to resuspend (this is the 10-2 dilution).Repeat step 3e iii to create dilutions all the way out to 10-8.Note: Alternative methods of performing a series of 10-fold serial dilutions, such as using a multichannel pipette in a 96-well plate may be used instead. Spot 10 μl of each dilution onto a pre-warmed BHI plate containing neomycin and another containing neomycin and mupirocin (see Note 5). All dilutions to be plated for recipient colony counting should be plated on the same plate, as in Figure 2A, and all dilutions to be plated for transconjugant colony counting should be plated on an additional plate, as in Figure 2B.Note: Tilt the plate at a 45° angle until the drop of the dilution almost reaches the edge of the plate, then set it flat on the benchtop and let dry.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170501/20170501222011_8841.jpgFigure 2.

    "Recipient and transconjugant countingCount the number of recipients (colonies on plates containing only neomycin) for each filter from Day 2, as shown in Figure 2A.Determine the number of colonies in the highest dilution where the colonies are still countable.Multiply the number of colonies by 100 and by the dilution factor (101 for the 10-1 dilution, 102 for the 10-2 dilution, etc.) to obtain the number of colony forming units per milliliter.Count the number of transconjugants (colonies on plates containing neomycin and mupirocin) for each filter from Day 2, as in step 4a and shown in Figure 2B.Calculate the conjugation efficiency (see Data analysis)."
