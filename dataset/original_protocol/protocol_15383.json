    "NOTE: Ensure that the required materials are available and properly prepared (see Table of Materials).\n1. Preparation\nMechanically lyse tissue sample (1-2 mg of tissue in 100 µL of lysis buffer, Table 1) or cultured cells (10 cm plate that is 80-90% confluent in 350 µL of lysis buffer), with the goal being to collect a total of 900 µL of sample for the experiment. Note that this volume is in slight excess of what is required for the experiment described below.\nSpin down the samples by centrifugation at 17,500 x g for 3 minutes at 4 °C. Upon completion, transfer 270 µL of the supernatant to each of three new 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tubes. There will be approximately 90 µL remaining. Remove 40 µL to be used as an “input control” and place in a new tube. Place all samples on ice.\n2. Kinase assay: thiophosphorylation and alkylation\nLabel the three tubes containing 270 µL each as follows: “kinase rxn”, “GTPγS only”, and “PNBM (p-nitrobezyl mesylate) only”. Prepare the kinase reactions.\n\t\nTo the “kinase rxn” tube, add 2.7 µL (equivalent to 1,350 U) of CK2, then add 2.7 µL of 2.5 mM GTPγS.\nTo the “GTPγS only” tube, add 2.7 µL of 2.5 mM GTPγS, and then add 2.7 µL of lysis buffer.\nTo the “PNBM only” tube, add 5.4 µL of lysis buffer. Flick all tubes to mix and then immediately place on ice.\nIncubate all three tubes for 1 min in a 30 °C water bath. Following incubation, add 13.5 µL of 12 mg/mL PNBM to all three tubes. Invert to mix samples. Incubate these samples at room temperature for 1 h.\nAfter starting the incubation in step 2.2, prepare the desalting columns as soon as possible as the process takes approximately 45 min.",
    "3. Preparation of desalting columns\nInitially prepare columns (3 for this example experiment) by inverting each column several times to re-suspend the Sephadex G-25 resin in the storage buffer. Allow the resin to settle by attaching each column to a clamp stand and letting it sit undisturbed for approximately 5 min.\nFollowing settling of the Sephadex G-25 resin, remove the caps from both the top and bottom of the column to allow the storage buffer to drain by gravity and have a tube placed below the bottom opening to collect the flow-through for discard.\nOnce storage buffer is depleted, add approximately 2.7 mL of lysis buffer in order to equilibrate the columns. Collect the flow-through and discard. Repeat 3 times. Following the final equilibration, the columns are ready for step 4.1.\n4. Removal of PNBM\nAfter the 1 h incubation (step 2.2) and column preparation (step 3) are complete, apply the samples to the columns. Label each column as follows: “kinase rxn”, “GTPγS only”, and “PNBM only”. Load all of each sample onto its respective column. Collect and discard the flow-through.\nWash samples by adding 420 µL of lysis buffer to each column. Allow lysis buffer to filter through the column and collect the flow-through for discard. Following this wash step, place tubes in position for collection of samples.\nElute samples by adding 500 µL of lysis buffer to each column. Collect the flow-through that now contains thiophosphorylated and alkylated CK2 substrates.\n5. Immunoprecipitation: Part I\nPrepare samples for immunoprecipitation by first removing 80 µL for an “elution input control” sample from each of the respective elutions (“kinase rxn”, “GTPγS only”, and “PNBM only”) collected in step 4.3. Following removal of 80 µL from each sample, there will be approximately 420 µL remaining per sample.",
    "Split each sample into 2 tubes containing 200 µL each. Label each respective tube: “kinase rxn anti-thiophosphate ester”, “kinase rxn IgG”, “GTPγS anti-thiophosphate ester”, “GTPγS IgG”, “PNBM anti-thiophosphate ester”, and “PNBM IgG”.\nAdd 2.8 µg of anti-thiophosphate ester antibody to each of the anti-thiophosphate ester-labeled tubes and 2.8 µg of isotype control antibody to each of the IgG-labeled tubes. Place tubes on a rotator at 4 °C for 2 h.\nBegin preparation of protein A/G bead during the last 15 min of the 2 h incubation in step 5.2.\n6. Protein A/G agarose bead preparation\nBriefly vortex the storage tube to ensure beads are completely re-suspended. Cut off the end of a P200 pipette tip using a clean razor blade in order to increase gauge size. Pipet 100 µL of the bead slurry per immunoprecipitation into a new 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube. For this example, a total of 6 tubes are needed.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 17,500 x g for 1 min at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant and discard. Re-suspend the beads in 200 µL of lysis buffer and briefly vortex. Repeat the spin and wash steps 3 times.\nFollowing the final wash, place the beads on ice until the incubation in step 5.2 is complete.\n7. Immunoprecipitation: Part II\nAfter the 2 h incubation from step 5.2, spin down the samples at 17,500 x g for 3 min at 4 °C. Following centrifugation add 200 µL from each sample to the tubes with the washed beads. Place the tubes on a rotator at 4 °C for 1 h.",
    "Following the 1 h incubation, centrifuge the tubes at 17,500 x g for 1 min at 4 °C. Next remove 40 µL of supernatant from each sample and save as a “depletion control” (total 6 tubes). Remove the remainder of the supernatant and discard. Take care not to disturb the beads.\nWash the samples by adding 200 µL of lysis buffer and vortexing briefly. Then centrifuge at 17,500 x g for 1 min at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant and discard. Repeat the wash and spin steps 3 times. Take care not to disturb the beads during these steps.\nAfter completing the wash steps, add 50 µL of 2x sample buffer to each sample containing beads. For all other samples, add 8 µL of 6x sample buffer: “input control”, “elution input controls”, and “depletion controls”.\nOnce buffer is added to the tubes, pipet up and down to mix, and heat all samples at 95 °C for 5 min before proceeding with SDS-PAGE.\n8. Analysis/Validation of results\nValidate successful CK2-dependent thiophosphorylation and alkylation.\n\t\nTo determine the efficacy of CK2-mediated thiophosphorylation in step 2.2, perform SDS-PAGE and Western blotting by running 15-20 µL of the “elution input controls” collected in step 5.1 on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel.\nProbe membranes with the following antibodies: anti-thiophosphate ester, anti-CK2α, and anti-GAPDH (or other appropriate loading control). If this step was successful, an enhanced anti-thiophosphate ester signal should be apparent in the “kinase rxn” lane compared to the other two lanes (Figure 2).\nVisualize enriched putative substrates of CK2 and determine protein identity.",
    "To assess if the immunoprecipitation steps were successful, run 25-30 µL of the samples eluted from the beads in step 7.4 on a separate 12.5% polyacrylamide gel. Ensure that all equipment is clean and wear gloves at all times during this step to minimize contamination.\nStain the gel with Coomassie blue to visualize enriched proteins from various stages of the experimental protocol (Figure 3). Using new razorblades, carefully excise unique bands present in the “kinase rxn anti-thiophosphate ester IP” lane, noting their approximate molecular weights.\nSubmit these bands for protein identification by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (Figure 4). If antibodies directed against the identified proteins are available, confirm the results of mass spectrometry by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting of input, depleted, and IP fractions collected during the course of the protocol (Figure 4).\nSubscription Required.
