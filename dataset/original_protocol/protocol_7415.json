    "The following protocol is optimized for 2 × 105 cells; however, we have successfully used this protocol to isolate and quantify C-circles with up to 5 × 105 cells. If adjusting cell numbers, all volumes should be scaled appropriately. We have successfully quantified C-circle abundance in ALT-positive human (Robinson et al., 2021) and mouse (Robinson et al., 2020) cells isolated from distinct 2D and 3D culture conditions, and from cells subjected to an array of genetic and pharmacologic manipulations. Thus, in our hands, this represents a generalizable protocol for C-circle quantitation across diverse in vitro conditions. Therefore, specific details regarding cell lines and culture conditions are not included here, except where noted as experimental controls.Note: Established ALT- and telomerase-positive cell lines (see Materials and Reagents) should be cultured in parallel with cell line(s) of interest. These serve as a source of DNA for standard curve generation (ALT) as well as positive (ALT) and negative (telomerase) controls for RCA and C-circle quantification. In our experience, results are best when all DNA (including controls) is isolated simultaneously. Doing so prevents degradation of DNA during storage or repeated freeze-thaw cycling of samples that are shared between experiments (e.g., positive and negative controls). DNA isolation from cultured cells using Quick C-circle Preparation (QCP) Pre-warm 1× QCP lysis buffer (see Recipe 1) in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube in a heat block or water bath set to 56 °C. Best results are achieved when QCP lysis buffer is made fresh for each experiment. Volume of QCP lysis buffer needed = 50 μL × (number of samples + 2) (included excess to account for pipetting error or evaporative loss).If lyophilized, resuspend protease (7.5 AU) in 7 mL of deionized, nuclease-free H2O. Mix thoroughly and place on ice until use.",
    "If previously resuspended, remove from -20 °C storage and thaw slowly on ice.Note: QIAGEN protease is preferred to other proteases because it can be heat-inactivated at 65 °C. Liberate cells from culture plates (e.g., trypsinization, nonenzymatic digestion from 3D culture) or remove cells from frozen storage and place on ice. At this stage, samples should be cell pellets rather than suspensions.Add protease to pre-warmed QCP lysis buffer at a ratio of 1:20 (i.e., 2.5 μL of protease to 50 μL of QCP lysis buffer). Mix thoroughly by vortexing and collect by microcentrifugation. This should be done immediately prior to cell resuspension.Resuspend each cell pellet in 50 μL of QCP lysis buffer supplemented with protease. Mix by vortexing at 2,000 rpm for 15 s. Suspensions are viscous and may require additional mixing by pipetting up and down. Be careful not to introduce bubbles during resuspension.Note: C-circles mixed with genomic DNA (i.e., in whole-cell lysates) are somewhat protected from shear forces compared to pure circular DNAs. While mixing samples by vortexing is acceptable and used throughout this protocol, repeated vortexing results in small but appreciable C-circle loss (<1% per 15 s vortex). If yield appears to be low during quantitation, vortex speed or frequency may be adjusted to minimize C-circle loss. Incubate cell suspensions at 56 °C for 1 h on a heat block. Samples should be mixed by vortexing for 15 s every 15–20 min.Increase temperature of heat block to 70 °C and incubate for 20 min to inactivate protease. Samples do not need to be mixed during this step.Allow samples to cool slowly to room temperature on a benchtop. Once cooled, mix by vortexing at 2,000 rpm for 15 s and collect any evaporated liquid by microcentrifugation.Samples may be used immediately for DNA quantitation and RCA.",
    "Otherwise, flash-freeze on dry ice and store at -80 °C.Quantitation of total cellular DNA Perform serial dilutions of QuantiFluor® ONE Lambda DNA (400 ng/μL) (from QuantiFluor® ONE dsDNA system) to generate dsDNA standards according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Final DNA concentrations are: 400, 200, 50, 12.5, 3.1, 0.8, and 0.2 ng/μL.In a 96-well microplate, transfer 200 μL of QuantiFluor® ONE dsDNA dye to each well that will contain standards, experimental samples, or blanks (i.e., background fluorescence). Each standard, sample, and blank should be analyzed in duplicate.Using a P2 pipettor, transfer 1 μL of each experimental sample or dsDNA standard prepared in Step B1 to the corresponding wells. For blank wells, add 1 μL of 1× TE buffer.Mix the plate thoroughly using a plate shaker or by pipetting the contents of each well using a multichannel pipette. If using a pipette, do not pipette up the entire volume of each well, and eject slowly to avoid introducing air bubbles, which can interfere with fluorescence detection.Incubate plate for 5 min at room temperature, protected from light.Measure fluorescence using a plate reader. If using the GloMax® system, select the preloaded protocol “QuantiFluor ONE dsDNA System.” Otherwise, use the following excitation and emission parameters: 504 and 531 nm, respectively.To calculate the DNA concentration of each experimental sample, first subtract the blank fluorescence from that of each standard and sample. Use these corrected values for the dsDNA standards to generate a standard curve of fluorescence intensity vs. DNA concentration (i.e., DNA concentration on x-axis and fluorescence on y-axis). Determine the DNA concentration of each sample using the standard curve equation (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4627/bioprotoc-13-05-4627-g001.jpgFigure 1.

    "Each DNA concentration was analyzed and graphed in duplicate.Rolling circle amplification (RCA) of extrachromosomal DNA Make up Φ29 DNA polymerase master mix (see Recipe 3) and store aliquots at -20 °C if not used immediately. We have used frozen master mix up to one month after initial freezing with no appreciable impact on RCA efficiency.If thawing QCP samples, place on ice to thaw slowly. Once thawed, mix by vortexing at 2,000 rpm for 15 s and collect by microcentrifugation. Keep samples and master mix on ice while setting up RCA reactions.For samples isolated using QCP (including ALT-positive and ALT-negative controls), add 1 μL to 9 μL of 10 mM Tris, pH 7.6 in two 0.2 mL PCR tubes. Depending on the concentration of each sample, they may be diluted in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.6 to avoid pipetting small volumes. However, the total quantity of QCP buffer in each reaction must be the same and should not exceed 1 μL.Aliquot 9.25 μL of Φ29 master mix for each reaction (plus excess, i.e., enough for two extra reactions) into an Eppendorf tube.Remove Φ29 DNA polymerase from -20 °C storage and keep on ice or in a portable cooling block. Add 0.75 μL of polymerase per reaction (plus excess) to tube containing master mix to generate the final reaction mix. Mix by gently flicking the tubes and place on ice.Note: Excess polymerase is used relative to template to ensure linear amplification of circular DNAs (rather than logarithmic, which could confound comparative analysis). Other polymerases (e.g., Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I) may be used if they possess processivity and strand displacement capability as Φ29 polymerase. Repeat step C4, aliquoting into a new Eppendorf tube. Add 0.75 μL of Milli-Q H2O per reaction to this tube.",
    "This serves as the final reaction mix for Φ29-deficient reactions, which are performed for each sample.Note: Sample-specific background can be corrected by running a Φ29-deficient RCA reaction in parallel for each sample. This is important for C-circle quantitation by qPCR because denaturation during PCR enables the detection of linear telomeric DNA. In addition, the inclusion of Φ29-deficient controls is particularly useful for samples with low or unknown ALT activity, as these may exhibit relatively high background signal. Add 10 μL of final reaction mix (Φ29-containing and Φ29-deficient) to one tube containing each QCP sample. Mix by gently vortexing (<1,500 rpm) for 5 s.Incubate tubes in a thermal cycler according to the following thermal profile:30 °C for 4–8 h (RCA).Note: Increasing amplification time increases sensitivity at the expense of reduced linearity. If absolute C-circle abundance is known or expected to be high, 4 h is sufficient for amplification. If C-circle abundance is low or unknown, incubation should be increased to 8 h to maximize sensitivity. Reactions should not be extended beyond 8 h, as amplification becomes nonlinear at that time. 70 °C for 20 min (Φ29 inactivation).4 °C for ∞.Typically, we perform RCA for 8 h and allow to run overnight. Samples are stable at 4 °C until convenient to collect the following morning.Generally, we use RCA reactions immediately for C-circle quantitation. However, reactions may also be stored at -20 °C for up to two weeks or at -80 °C for up to one month without appreciable DNA loss.Determination of C-circle abundance using qPCR Thaw SYBR® Green Supermix and primers from -20 °C storage on ice. Protect SYBR® Green Supermix from light.",
    "Each sample will be used to quantify C-circle abundance as well as the abundance of the single-copy gene ribosomal protein lateral stalk subunit P0 (also known as 36B4; see Materials and Reagents). Single-copy gene abundance provides a measure of total DNA content, which can be used to normalize C-circle abundance and enable comparative analysis (see Data Analysis). Thus, all subsequent steps should account for the fact that both targets will be measured (e.g., making sufficient master mix).Dilute DNA isolated from an ALT-positive cell line (e.g., U2OS, Saos-2) by QCP to obtain samples for generating a standard curve. For example, for a starting DNA concentration of 3.2 ng/μL, perform five two-fold serial dilutions for a final dilution series containing 3.2, 1.6, 0.8, 0.4, 0.2, and 0.1 ng/μL DNA. To account for differences in PCR efficiency between telomeric DNA and 36B4, each sample will be analyzed in duplicate for each target. Keep diluted samples on ice until ready to load PCR plate.Note: RCA is not required prior to dilution and standard curve generation. Assemble qPCR master mixes according to the recipe outlined in Table 1. In addition to Φ29-containing and Φ29-deficient RCA reactions, include a no-template control (using H2O in place of template DNA) to account for DNA contamination of PCR reagents. The Ct values for this no-template control should be at least four cycles greater than the Ct value of the lowest concentration on the standard curve.Table 1. Recipe for qPCR master mix. table:",

To avoid qPCR inhibition, limit the RCA reaction that is added to each qPCR reaction or pretreat each RCA sample with a pyrophosphatase. Given the sensitivity of qPCR, it is generally best to limit the quantity of undiluted RCA reaction that is added to <5% of the qPCR reaction volume. Add 4 μL (i.e., 2 ng) of template DNA (Φ29-containing or Φ29-deficient) or RNase-free H2O (for no-template control) to pre-designated wells of a 96-well PCR plate. Each sample should be analyzed in triplicate.Add 21 μL of qPCR master mix to each well containing DNA or H2O. Mix by gently vortexing the plate for 5 s and collect volume by centrifugation.Incubate plate in a real-time thermal cycler according to the following thermal profile:95 °C for 15 min95 °C for 15 s54 °C for 2 min72 °C for 1 minRepeat steps b–d 34 times"
