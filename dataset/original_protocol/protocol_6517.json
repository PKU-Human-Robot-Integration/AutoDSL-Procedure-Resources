    "Preparation of cell lysatesRemove cells from the tissue culture incubator and place on ice. For adherent cells growing in a 10 cm plate, discard tissue culture media and rinse the cell monolayer twice with 5 ml ice-cold PBS. For suspension cells, proceed to Step A3.While keeping the plate(s) on ice, add 1ml of ice-cold PBS, scrape and transfer the detached cells to pre-chilled microcentrifuge tubes on ice.Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 2,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the PBS supernatant.Lyse the cells by gently resuspending cell pellets in the appropriate amount of ice-cold modified RIPA lysis buffer (generally 200-500 μl for one 10 cm plate of 50-70% confluent cells) and incubate for 10 min on ice.Optional: If the cells were lysed in a buffer that releases chromatin from nuclei, sonication will be necessary to reduce sample viscosity. Keeping the cell lysates on ice, sonicate with 3-5 1-second pulses at 50% output.Centrifuge the lysates at 15,000 x g for 5 min at 4°C to pellet any insoluble cell debris.Transfer the supernatants to new microcentrifuge tubes pre-chilled on ice and assess the protein concentration by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay per the manufacturer’s instructions.In vitro TG2 crosslinking reactionsReconstitute the lyophilized TG2 enzyme at 4 U/ml (= 4 mU/µl) in TG2 reconstitution buffer. For a 1 unit vial of TG2, reconstitute with 250 µl of buffer for a final concentration of 4 U/ml. Place on ice while setting up the crosslink reactions.Prepare the in vitro crosslink reactions by adding the reagents in the order listed below to microcentrifuge tubes. The TG2 enzyme concentration, total reaction volume, and substrate concentrations should be optimized for each application. Some typical final concentrations for the reagents in reaction buffer are noted below:Reaction buffer with protease inhibitorsCrosslink substrates: cell lysate (0.",
    "25 µg/µl) or purified recombinant proteins (10-20 ng/µl)TG2 enzyme (0.05-1.0 mU/ml)CaCl2 (2-5 mM)Incubate the reactions for 60 min at 37 °C.Quench the crosslink reactions by adding SDS-PAGE loading buffer to 1x concentration, followed by heating at 95 °C for 5 min on a heating block.Assess samples for protein crosslinking by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting.When using in vitro crosslink reactions to test new potential TG2 substrates, positive and negative controls are also important. Using previously established crosslink substrates as a positive control will ensure the reactions are working as expected. Any commercially available protein with known TG2 substrate activity will work, with one caveat; the protein should have both glutamine and lysine crosslink sites. Otherwise a mixture of a protein with only glutamine donor sites and lysine acceptor sites would need to be included to ensure crosslinking occurs. Our lab typically uses recombinant Y-box 1 (YB-1) protein, which contains both glutamine and lysine crosslink sites and can be crosslinked to itself in vitro (Willis et al., 2013 and non-published data), or HMGB1, which contains only lysine acceptor sites but is crosslinked in vitro to Glutamine 636 of TG2 (Willis et al., 2018).Substrate Incorporation assaysFor substrate incorporation assays, purified recombinant proteins are incubated with TG2 enzyme as described above, but in the presence of biotin-pentylamine (BP), a TG2 lysine donor substrate, or biotin-TVQQEL (A25 peptide), a TG2 glutamine donor substrate. Reaction mixtures are then size-fractionated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed for substrate incorporation with streptavidin -HRP by Western blot.Reactions are set up in a similar manner to the TG2 crosslink reactions described above.Reconstitute the lyophilized TG2 enzyme at 4 U/ml in TG2 reconstitution buffer. Place on ice while setting up the substrate incorporation assays.",
    "Set up the substrate incorporation reactions by adding the reagents to microcentrifuge tubes in the order they are listed below:Reaction buffer with protease inhibitorsPurified recombinant protein crosslink substrate (10-20 ng/µl)BP or A25 peptide (2 mM)TG2 enzyme (1.0 mU/ml)CaCl2 (2-5 mM)Incubate for 60 min at 37 °C.Stop the reactions by adding concentrated SDS-loading buffer to a final 1x concentration and heat for 5 min at 95 °C on a heating block. The samples are ready to be separated by SDS-PAGE."
