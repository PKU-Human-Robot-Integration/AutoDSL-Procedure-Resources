    "Axenic myceliumCollect fresh lichen thalli with mature apothecia (Figure 1A), ideally in autumn to spring, but not during summer because this species does not produce sufficient viable spores during the warm and dry season. Thalli may be stored in glass Petri dishes, air-dry during several days in the refrigerator for up to one week.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150702/20150702073534_4120.jpgFigure 1. Thallus of Lobaria pulmonaria and arrangement of the apothecium. A. Fresh thallus with apothecia of different ages. Arrows: Mature apothecia suitable for ascospore harvesting; they are convex in the fully hydrated state and approx. 1.5-3.0 mm in diameter. B. Inverted Petri dish with apothecium on moist filter paper.Thoroughly clean the sterile bench with either 75% alcohol or 5 min UV radiation, or both.Prepare the germination medium, autoclave and pour into plastic Petri dishes. Prepare a high number of agar plates for several isolation steps (up to 50 plates). Allow the germination medium to cool down and gelatinize within the sterile bench. With a sterile inoculation needle scratch few superficial lines into the agar (this will help finding the focal plane of the agar surface), then turn the agar plates upside down and continue work.Place several filter papers into the glass Petri dish. Wrap Petri dish with aluminum foil and sterilize it in the autoclave. Place one sterile filter paper on the inner surface of the lid of one inverted Petri dish and moisten it with sterile tap water (Figure 1B).Use a pointed forceps for excising mature apothecia. Cut the lower part of the apothecia flat by means of a fresh razor blade. Work in sterile bench and place one apothecium on the moisten filter paper by using sterile forceps. The apothecium needs to be fully hydrated, but without superficial water film (this might prevent the ascospores from being ejected).",
    "Close the inverted Petri dish, including the apothecium. After having prepared 15-20 Petri dishes, each with one apothecium, incubate the inverted Petri dishes in a growth chamber at 15-16 °C in the dark. The wet paper hydrate the apothecium causing it to discharge ascospores upward onto the medium within minutes or during the first 24 h at the latest.Important! After 24 h incubation replace all lids, including filter paper and the apothecium, by new sterile lids and keep the plates at 15-16 °C in the dark.Check the Petri dishes every day under the dissecting microscope with transmitted light for bacterial (slimy) or fungal contaminants (see Note 2). Fast-growing fungal contaminants sporulate within a few days and opening the plate will disseminate the wind-dispersed spores. Thus, discard the infected plates without opening!Ascospores of L. pulmonaria will germinate within 10-15 days after having been ejected. Place a clean microscope within the sterile bench. Normally, fusiform spores are visible (approx. 18-30 µm long x 5-9 µm wide) (Figure 2A). As these spores are usually three-celled more than one cell may germinate (Figure 2A, asterisk).Ignite the Bunsen burner and adjust the blue flame. Thoroughly sterilize the inoculation needles by flaming and allow them to cool down before using. Open a plate with germinated spores under the microscope, pick out one spore using a sterile needle and transfer it onto a fresh Petri dish with germinating medium. Transfer around four spores to each plate, then close the Petri dish and incubate it at 15-16 °C in the dark. Repeat this for each germinating spore.Check the plates every second day for the growth rates of the isolates and for contaminations. If single spores are affected by contamination, either cut them out or transfer the others to new agar plates.",
    "Repeat steps A7-9 during several weeks until the plates contain clean colonies of growing mycelia of L. pulmonaria.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150702/20150702074453_5326.jpgFigure 2. Ascospores and mycelium of L. pulmonaria on agar. A. Germinating ascospores 10 days after spore discharge. Asterisk: Spore with several germ tubes. B. The mycelium of L. pulmonaria grows very slowly. Axenic mycelium 85 days after spore discharge.Propagation in liquid Lichen MediumPrepare 1 L of Lichen Medium and autoclave it with the program for liquids. Wrap cellulose plugs and dissection needles in aluminum foil. Close Erlenmeyer flasks and glass beakers openings with aluminum foil. Autoclave all instruments with the program for solid material.Store the Lichen Medium and material in the cleaned sterile bench and wait until they have attained room temperature! Place a microscope into the sterile bench and clean all of its surfaces thoroughly with 75% EtOH.Fill 50-100 ml of Lichen Medium into each Erlenmeyer flask. Under the microscope dissect one or several mycelial colonies from the agar surface with a sterile inoculation needle and transfer them to the liquid medium in the Erlenmeyer flask.Gently flame the opening of the Erlenmeyer flask, close the flask and keep the aluminum foil on the outer part of the plug intact. Incubate at 15-16 °C with a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle during a few months, thus allowing the mycelium to grow into a colony visible to the naked eye.Wrap each stainless steel rod of the homogenizer with aluminum foil prior to autoclaving; mark the opening of the rod, which will fit to the homogenizer, and keep the blade side covered until it is used. Mount the sterile rod on the homogenizer in a 45° angle and remove the aluminum foil immediately prior to use (Figure 3A). Adjust the homogenizer to level 2 (bigger colonies) or higher (smaller colonies).",
    "Insert the homogenizer rod into the Erlenmeyer flask with liquid medium and fungal colony. Switch the homogenizer on. Turn the flask slowly during the grinding process, thus making sure that the fungal colonies are getting finely disrupted. This process will kill many cells by disruption, but the majority stays intact and will continue growth. After approx. 10-20 sec homogenization, switch the homogenizer off (Figure 3C). Flame the opening of the Erlenmeyer flask and the cotton plug and seal the flask. Replace the used homogenizer rod by a sterile one for the next flask.Incubate at 15-16 °C with 12 h light and 12 h dark during several months, allowing the mycelium pieces to grow visible to the naked eye.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150702/20150702074509_0390.jpgFigure 3.

It has begun to produce light colored mycelium on the surface of each hyphae clump after transfer into liquid medium (see Note 1). C. Whitish mycelium of L. pulmonaria after homogenization.Harvesting mycelium for DNA or RNA isolationIntroduce a rack containing a Falcon tube into a cryogenic vessel and fill it with liquid nitrogen. The cryogenic vessel must not be sterile.Mount a sterile rod on the homogenizer. Ignite the Bunsen burner. Remove the plug from the Erlenmeyer flask. Harvest some mycelium by using a sterile bar spoon with perforations. Immediately, introduce the mycelium into liquid nitrogen in the Falcon tube by pushing it down from the spoon with a sterile spatula. After harvesting, decant the old medium slowly into the 500 ml glass beaker without losing the remaining mycelium and without touching the glass beaker.",
    "Refill 50-100 ml fresh medium into the Erlenmeyer flask. Remove the aluminum foil from the homogenizer and grind the mycelium as mentioned above. Flame the Erlenmeyer opening and the cotton plug prior to closing. Repeat steps C1-3 as many times as needed.Keep Falcon tubes always filled with liquid nitrogen. Store Falcon tubes at -80 °C. Important: do not completely close the tube; instead, open one twist of the screw thread to let evaporating nitrogen escape.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150702/20150702074541_6119.jpgFigure 4.
