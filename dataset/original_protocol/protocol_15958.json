    "This protocol describes how to prepare the target cells for the assay. This preparation is specific to the K562 tumor cell line. K562 cells are derived from human lymphoblasts isolated from the bone marrow of a chronic myelogenous leukemia patient. The cells used here have been transduced with human CD19 (K562-CD19). Non-transduced K562 cells are used as an antigen-negative control.\nIf an alternative tumor cell line is used, appropriate media and passage conditions specific to that cell line should be used. Any tumor cell line being used should express the target antigen at levels comparable to those observed on tumor tissue from patients. Additionally, an antigen-negative control should be used. This should be as close as possible to the antigen-positive cell line but lacking target antigen expression.\nMaterials\nK562 target cells (ATCC CLL-243)\nK562 target cells with stable CD19 expression\nComplete IMDM (see recipe)\nSterile 50-ml Falcon tubes (High Clarity PP, Corning, cat. no. 352070)\n10- and 25-ml serological pipets (e.g., Costar Strippette, Merck, cat. no. CLS4488)\nCell counter, manual or automated\nTissue culture microscope (e.g., Olympus)\n75-cm2 tissue culture flasks (e.g., Nunc EasYFlask, Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 156472)\n1. Thaw 1 × 107 K562 and K562-CD19 cells and resuspend separately in 20 ml complete IMDM in 50-ml centrifuge tubes.\nIf more or fewer cells are thawed, the suspension volumes should be adjusted to give the same cell density (5 × 105 cells/ml).\n2. Centrifuge cells 4 min at 600 × g, 20°C. Remove supernatant and resuspend cells in 20 ml complete IMDM.\nWashing cells removes the DMSO in the freezing medium, which is toxic to thawed cells.\n3. Repeat step 2, but resuspend in 10 ml complete IMDM.\n4. Count cells and adjust density to 3 × 105 cells/ml.",
    "The equation for determining cell count depends on the counting tool used.\n5. Seed up to 30 ml suspension (9 × 106 cells) in 75-cm2 EasYFlasks. Split cells every third day at a concentration of 3 × 105 cells/ml.\nK562 and K562-CD19 cells grow rapidly, so excess cells do not need to be kept. One T75 flask (<30 ml) is sufficient for the assay.\nOnce cells have been passaged a minimum of two times after thawing, they are ready to be used in the assay. Cells can be passaged more than two times, but should not be kept in culture for excessive lengths of time (more than eight passages).",
    "Monocytes being used will need to be isolated from the same PBMC donor as was used to generate the CAR T cells. This will mitigate any alloreactivity between the two cell types, which could confound results. Monocytes will need to be isolated immediately prior to assay seeding, in order to avoid the cells becoming too adhesive or altering their phenotype. This protocol describes the isolation of monocytes using the Dynabeads Untouched Human Monocytes Kit (Invitrogen), which allows for isolation of the monocytes via negative selection.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.864#cpz1864-prot-0001])\nHuman PBMCs autologous to the CAR T cells being used (isolated from blood and stored in liquid nitrogen)\nGibco Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS; Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 14190144)\nIsolation buffer (see recipe)\nInvitrogen Dynabeads Untouched Human Monocytes Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 11350D)\nSterile 15-ml Falcon tubes (High Clarity PP, Corning, cat. no. 352096)\nMagnet for bead isolation (e.g., EasySep, Stemcell Technologies, cat. no. 18103)\nCell rocker (e.g., Corning LSE Platform Rocker)\n1. Thaw 50 × 106 PBMCs and resuspend in 10 ml DPBS in a 15-ml centrifuge tube.\n2. Centrifuge 4 min at 600 × g, 20°C, and resuspend in 10 ml DPBS.\n3. Centrifuge once more and resuspend in 500 μl isolation buffer.\n4. Add 100 μl blocking reagent and 100 μl antibody mix (both supplied in monocyte isolation kit) and mix well by pipetting gently after all components are added.\n5. Incubate 20 min at 2°-8°C.\n6. While cells are incubating, wash the beads.\n         \nVortex vial of beads well (∼20 s) to ensure that they are evenly resuspended.\nAdd 500 μl beads to 5 ml isolation buffer in a 15-ml centrifuge tube.\nPlace tube in a magnetic stand and leave for 4 min.\nRemove buffer and resuspend beads in 500 μl isolation buffer.",
    "7. Wash cells once by adding 10 ml isolation buffer, centrifuging 4 min at 600 × g, and removing buffer.\n8. Resuspend cells in 500 μl isolation buffer.\n9. Add 500 μl washed beads to the cells and incubate 15 min at 2°-8°C with gentle rocking.\nThe tube may need to be attached to a cell rocker with adhesive tape to prevent it from rolling off.\n10. Place tube in the magnetic stand for 4 min to separate the unwanted bead-bound cells.\nThis is a negative (untouched) selection, so unwanted cells will attach to the beads/magnet while the monocytes remain in the isolation buffer.\n11. Transfer monocyte-containing supernatant to a new 15-ml tube and place in the magnetic stand for another 4 min.\nDoing a second pass over the magnet will improve removal of bead-bound cells, increasing the purity of the monocyte population.\n12. Transfer supernatant to a new tube and count monocytes.\nApproximately 5 × 106 monocytes are expected from 50 × 106 PBMCs.\n13. Proceed immediately to assay seeding (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.864#cpz1864-prot-0003]).",
    "This protocol describes how to seed the assay in a 96-well plate. Before beginning this protocol, the user should have performed Basic Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.864#cpz1864-prot-0001] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.864#cpz1864-prot-0002] and have the CAR T cells prepared in culture, ready to be used in the assay.\nIt is important that an appropriate plate layout be planned in advance in order to determine the total number of cells needed for seeding. The number of target cells, monocytes, and CAR T cells needed will depend on how many CAR T cell products/constructs/conditions are being tested. An example layout is shown in Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.864#cpz1864-fig-0003]. The plate should be set up so that each CAR T cell construct or donor is performed in triplicate. Controls should include antigen-negative target cells, wells without monocytes, wells without CAR T cells, and wells with medium only. An untransduced T cell control can also be used in place of one of the CAR T cell constructs.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/39bf1249-459a-425c-a866-621e36c0dc45/cpz1864-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nExample 96-well plate setup for an experiment comparing two different CAR T cell constructs or products. Control conditions include antigen-negative target cells, no-monocyte wells, no–CAR T cell wells, and medium-only wells. All conditions are set up in triplicate and all wells contain 200 μl. Up to four different CAR T cell constructs can be seeded on one plate, but only three can fit on one ELISA/Bio-Plex plate when one accounts for standard curve wells.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.864#cpz1864-prot-0001] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.864#cpz1864-prot-0002])\nK562 target cells (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.864#cpz1864-prot-0001]), with and without CD19 expression\nIsolated monocytes (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.864#cpz1864-prot-0002])\nCAR T cells\n96-well U-bottom plate (Nunclon Delta Surface, Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 168136)\nCentrifuge for 96-well plates\n1. Collect K562 target cells and CAR T cells from culture and place in 50-ml centrifuge tubes.",
    "Monocytes should already be in a centrifuge tube following isolation.\n2. Count cells and calculate the total number needed for each cell type.\nAfter planning the plate layout, the total number needed will be 1 × 105 cells for each well containing Ag+ target cells, Ag– target cells, or monocytes, and 2 × 105 cells for each well containing CAR T cells.\n3. Centrifuge all cell types 4 min at 600 × g, 20°C, remove supernatant, and resuspend in complete IMDM at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml.\nBe very careful when removing supernatant to ensure that no cells are removed, as they have already been counted. A second count after resuspending the cells may be necessary to confirm that they are at the right concentration before seeding.\n4. Using your plate plan (e.g., Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.864#cpz1864-fig-0003]), seed cells as follows to give a 2:1:1 ratio:\n         \n100 μl CAR T cells (2 × 105 cells)\n50 μl monocytes (1 × 105 cells)\n50 μl target cells (1 × 105 cells)\nIn control wells, replace missing cell type(s) with complete IMDM so that all wells contain 200 μl.\n5. Incubate 24 hr at 37°C.\n6. Centrifuge plate 2 min at 900 × g.\n7. Transfer 160 μl supernatant to a new plate and freeze at −20°C until needed for cytokine analysis (see Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.864#cpz1864-prot-0004] and Alternate Protocol).\nAlthough we have not tested the upper limit, we do not recommend storing cytokine plates for more than 2 months.\nThe 160 μl supernatant can be split into multiple plates/aliquots if several readouts need to be performed. Freeze/thaw cycles should be avoided with supernatant cytokines, so it is important to plan readout assays in advance and divide the supernatant accordingly.",
    "This protocol details how to perform a single-cytokine (in this case IL-6) ELISA with cytokine supernatants collected from the overnight co-culture. It is recommended to perform this protocol while optimizing the assay or as a lower cost pre-screening step. IL-6 is a key cytokine involved in driving CRS and will provide sufficient indication of assay performance during the optimization/pre-screening stage. For a more comprehensive picture of a CAR construct's potential for CRS, Basic Protocol 5 is recommended.\nAn alternative ELISA for another clinically relevant cytokine, such as IL-1 or IFN-γ, could be used for the same purpose. These alternative/additional ELISAs will need to be optimized separately.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.864#cpz1864-prot-0001] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.864#cpz1864-prot-0002])\nELISA MAX Deluxe Set Human IL-6 kit (BioLegend, cat. no. 430504) including:\n               \n5× coating buffer\n200× IL-6 capture antibody\n5× assay diluent\nIL-6 standard\n200× IL-6 detection antibody\n1000× Avidin-HRP\nTMB substrates A and B\nDistilled water\nTween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no.

Prepare 12 ml of 1× coating buffer by diluting 2.4 ml of 5× stock in 9.6 ml distilled water.\n2. Add 60 μl of 200× capture antibody to give a 1× solution.\n3. Add 100 μl to each well of an ELISA plate using a multichannel pipette. Seal the plate and incubate overnight at 2°-8°C.\nPerform ELISA",
    "4. Prepare wash buffer by adding 250 μl Tween 20 to a 500-ml bottle of DPBS.\nOne 500-ml bottle of wash buffer should be sufficient for one ELISA plate. More may be necessary if more plates are being used. Any leftover buffer can be stored up to 3 months at 4°C.\n5. Wash plate four times with 200 μl/well wash buffer.\nPlate washes should be performed by adding buffer to the wells with a multichannel pipette, flicking the plate upside down into a bin lined with paper towel, and firmly tapping the plate upside-down onto a bench with paper towel. All subsequent ELISA washes should be performed in the same manner.\n6. Prepare the blocking agent by diluting 12 ml of 5× assay diluent in 48 ml DPBS. Add 200 μl to each well and incubate 1 hr at room temperature with constant shaking (850 rpm).\n7. While the plate is incubating, thaw plate(s) containing co-culture supernatants and dilute samples 1:5 in complete IMDM.\nThis can be done by using a multichannel pipette to add 160 μl medium to the wells of a new 96-well U-bottom plate in a configuration that mirrors the sample plate, then adding 40 μl samples to the corresponding wells. Multichannel pipette tips must be changed between samples.\nThis dilution may need to be optimized depending on the CAR T cells and target cells being used. For more information, see Critical Parameters and Troubleshooting.\n8. Prepare a serial dilution of IL-6 standard according to the kit's instructions.\nThe volume of standards generated is sufficient for running each in duplicate.\n9. When blocking is complete, wash plate four times with wash buffer.\n10. Remove the last wash and add 100 μl of all diluted samples and standards to the plate.",
    "If samples do not fit on one plate, each additional plate must contain its own set of standards. Samples should only be compared to standards on the same plate.\n11. Seal plate and incubate 2 hr at room temperature with constant shaking (850 rpm).\n12. Wash plate four times with wash buffer.\n13. Prepare a 1× solution of detection antibody by adding 60 μl of 200× stock to 12 ml assay diluent.\n14. Add 100 μl to each well of the ELISA plate and incubate 1 hr at room temperature with constant shaking (850 rpm).\n15. Wash plate four times with wash buffer.\n16. Dilute 1000× Avidin-HRP to 1× by adding 12 μl to 12 ml assay diluent.\n17. Add 100 μl to each well using a multichannel pipette and incubate 30 min at room temperature with constant shaking (850 rpm).\n18. Wash plate five times with wash buffer.\n19. Add 6 ml TMB substrate A to 6 ml TMB substrate B and mix briefly by vortexing.\nSubstrates A and B should only be combined immediately prior to use.\n20. Add 100 μl to each well using a multichannel pipette and incubate in the dark until the desired color has developed (∼2-10 min or until standard 4 is visibly blue).\nCover plate with foil or an opaque box and check color development approximately every 30 s. Do not let the plate over-develop (>10 min).\n21. Add 100 μl stop solution to each well using a multichannel pipette.\nThe wells should change immediately from blue to yellow.\n22. Measure absorbance at 450 and 570 nm.\nThe plate should be uncovered/unsealed for reading.\nAnalyze data\n23. Transport plate reader files to Excel and subtract all 450-nm values from their corresponding 570-nm values.\nThis will remove noise from the sample absorbance readings.",
    "24. Average the values of the medium-only wells and subtract from all other well readings to remove medium background.\nThese values should be relatively low (typically ∼0.005). If they are high, the medium may be contaminated or there may have been an error with assay seeding.\n25. Transfer data to PRISM and log-transform the data using the “Analyze” feature. In the dropdown menu, choose “Transform” and then “X=Log(X)”.\nA comparable plotting/analysis program can be used with the appropriate modification to commands.\n26. Using the “Analyze” option again, fit a non-linear regression line (curve fit) to the log-transformed data.\n27. Under “Analyze”, interpolate unknown sample values from the standard curve with a 95% confidence interval.\n28. Under “Analyze” and then “Transform”, transform the interpolated values using “X=10^X”.\n29. Using the resulting values, generate a bar graph presented as IL-6 concentration in pg/ml (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.864#cpz1864-fig-0004]).\nError bars can be generated by entering the three triplicate values for each condition. If multiple donors are looked at, donors can be combined (to increase the number of data points in each condition) or kept separate (to look at differences in cytokine production among donors).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/596da5d6-dc3b-4899-be1d-da6e9855a246/cpz1864-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nIL-6 ELISA results for comparison of three CAR T cell constructs and one untransduced T cell control. CAR T cells or untransfected T cells were placed in culture with autologous monocytes and K562 or K562-CD19 target cells along with a no-monocyte control. Cultures were assessed for IL-6 in the supernatant after 24 hr by ELISA. Significance was calculated using one-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparisons test; ns, p > 0.05; ** p < 0.01.

    "This protocol details how to perform the Bio-Plex 27-Plex Cytokine Array. This readout provides information on many of the clinically relevant cytokines for CRS. If a smaller cytokine array is used, it is recommended to ensure it includes IL-6, IFN-γ, GM-CSF, IL-10, and IL-2. Due to its higher cost, this assay should be used following optimization/prescreening with a single-cytokine ELISA.\nThis protocol is unchanged from the manufacturer's instructions provided with the Bio-Plex 27-Plex Cytokine Array kit. Refer to the generic protocol supplied with kit for more detail.\nMaterials\nCo-culture supernatants (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.864#cpz1864-prot-0003])\nBio-Plex Pro Human Cytokine 27-plex Assay (Bio-Rad, cat. no.

Use a multichannel pipette to add 196 μl assay medium to the wells of a new 96-well U-bottom plate in a configuration that mirrors the sample plate.\nUse the assay medium originally used to seed the cells.\n3. Add 4 μl of each sample to the corresponding well of medium to give a 1:50 dilution.\nMultichannel pipette tips must be changed in between samples.\n4. Prepare standards following the kit instructions.\n5. Vortex 1× Luminex beads for ∼20 s to ensure they are evenly suspended, then add 50 μl beads to each well of the plate.\n6. Use the Luminex 200 System to wash the plate two times with 100 μl wash buffer per well.\nConsult the instructions for the specific instrument being used. These should be in the user manual.\n7.

Use the Luminex 200 System to wash the plate three times with 100 μl wash buffer per well.",
    "9. Add 25 μl of 1× detection antibody to each well and incubate 30 min at room temperature with shaking at 850 rpm.\n10. Wash as in step 8.\n11. Add 50 μl of 1× streptavidin-PE to each well and wrap the plate in foil to shield it from light. Incubate 10 min at room temperature with shaking at 850 rpm.\n12. Wash as in step 8.\n13. Read plate using the Bio-Plex Manager Software and manufacturer's instructions.\nThis step will be unique to the specific software and equipment being used. Detailed instructions should found in the user manual or on the manufacturer's website.\n14. Analyze data using Prism or preferred analysis software.\nThe data can be displayed in multiple ways. In most cases, it is useful to first generate a heatmap from the data to gain an overall idea of the patterns seen between the different CAR T cell products and their cytokine profiles. One can then look more closely at specific cytokines by generating bar graphs (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.864#cpz1864-fig-0005]). As with ELISA data, error bars can be generated on the bar graphs by entering the three triplicate values for each condition. If multiple donors are being looked at, they can be combined (to increase the number of data points in each condition) or kept separate (to look at differences in cytokine production among donors).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e727dcf4-6e2b-4d53-a7ba-b5ec290d4292/cpz1864-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5",
