    "Note: The experiment should be carried out in a biosafety level 2 Lab. Preparation of bacteriaDay 1 Prepare or melt tryptic soy agar (TSA), as per manufacturer’s instructions, and let it cool down to about 45°C (e.g., in a water bath already set at 45 °C). Add sterile Congo red solution (see Recipes) to a final concentration of 0.01%, e.g., 5 ml of Congo red solution to 500 ml of TSA. Pour the plates (about 25 ml of TSA in each 10 cm diameter plate) next to an open flame or in a sterile cabinet and let them dry. Store the plates at 4°C and use them within 3 weeks.In the afternoon, streak out Shigella flexneri from the glycerol stock (see Notes) on a TSA plate supplemented with Congo red. Grow overnight (approximately 18 h) at 37 °C.Day 2 Inoculate 5 ml of TSB with a single red colony (Figure 1) of Shigella flexneri and incubate overnight at 37 °C with 180 rpm agitation.Day 3 Dilute the overnight culture 200 times in fresh TSB in a conical flask. For instance, in a 125 ml flask, take 25 ml of TSB and add 125 µl of the overnight culture. Incubate at 37 °C with 180 rpm agitation and grow till mid log-phase (OD600nm = 0.3-0.4). The doubling time of Shigella during the exponential phase is about 40 min. It typically takes about 3 h to reach the mid log-phase.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190701/20190701184528_1711.jpgFigure 1. Characteristic red colonies of Shigella flexneri on TSA supplemented with 0.01% Congo redPreparation of TC7 cellsDay 2 Remove the growth medium (see Recipes) from a cell culture flask with a confluent monolayer of TC7 cells.Wash the cells with sterile PBS three times.Add 5 ml of pre-warmed Trypsin solution and incubate the flask at 37 °C for about 4 min.",
    "Add 5 ml of growth medium (see Recipes) to inhibit the Trypsin and collect the trypsinized cells in a 50 ml centrifuge tube.Centrifuge at 900 x g and discard the supernatant. Re-suspend the pellet in 5-10 ml of growth medium devoid of antibiotics (see Recipes) by gentle pipetting. In a sterile 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, mix 10 µl of cell suspension with 10 µl of Trypan blue solution. Load 10 ml of this mixture on to the Countess II counting slide and using a Countess II cell counter, determine the number of cells.Seed the required number of wells in a 6-well plate with 1 million cells (1 x 106) per well, adding at least 2 ml of growth medium devoid of antibiotics (see Recipes) in each well. This number of cells is enough to form a fully confluent monolayer after one day of growth (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190701/20190701184626_3730.jpgFigure 2. Bright-field image of a monolayer of TC7 cellsInfectionDay 3 On Day 3, when the bacteria reach OD600nm = 0.3-0.4, pipette 1-1.5 ml culture into a microcentrifuge tube.Spin the tube at 3,000 x g for 5 min. Aspirate the supernatant. Add an equal volume of PBS at room temperature and resuspend the pellet by pipetting up and down or by gentle vortexing.Repeat Step C2 at least twice and finally resuspend the pellet in infection buffer at room temperature. Record the OD600nm of the bacterial suspension.The recommended multiplicity of infection (MOI) for this experiment is very low, 1 bacterium for every 150 cells. Since there are 1 x 106 cells in each well, the number of bacteria required per well is about 6,700.The number of Shigella cells at OD600nm = 1 is 0.5 x 109/ml; hence at OD = z, the number of bacterial cells = z x 0.5 x 109.",
    "Calculate the volume of bacterial suspension required for infecting each well using the following formula:Volume of bacterial suspension required (in ml) = 6,700/z x 0.5 x 109Additionally, make 10-fold serial dilutions of the bacterial suspension and spread 100 µl of each on TSA plates. Incubate the plates at 37 °C and count the colonies obtained the next day. This colony count of the inoculum will verify the number of bacteria used.Aspirate the medium from the TC7 cells plate and add 2 ml of PBS at room temperature to each well.Swirl the plate gently and carefully aspirate all the liquid. Wash the cells twice in a similar fashion and add 2 ml of infection buffer (see Recipes) at room temperature to each well.Add the desired volume of bacterial suspension (calculated in Step C3) to each well of the 6-well plate. Mix well by gentle pipetting to ensure that the bacterial suspension is mixed uniformly. Centrifuge the plate (using the plate adaptors in the centrifuge rotor) at 180 x g for 10 min at room temperature.Incubate the plate at 37 °C, 10% CO2, for 2 h.After incubation, wash the wells with prewarmed PBS three times as in Steps C4 and C5.Completely aspirate the liquid from the wells and cover cells with 2 ml of the cooled agarose overlay (see Recipes).Put the plates back at 37 °C, 10% CO2. Examine the plates daily for appearance of plaques. Two days incubation can be enough for optimal plaque size (1-2 mm diameter). However, it is dependent on the bacterial strain and frequent observation is therefore required.Visualization and enumeration of plaquesDay 5 or 6 After 48-72 h of incubation, very carefully peel off the agarose overlay using a scalpel to detach the overlay from the walls and by turning around the plate.",
    "Fix the cells by incubation in 95% ethanol for 5 min.Remove the ethanol and stain the wells with 5% Giemsa solution (see Recipes) for 10 min.Aspirate the stain and wash the wells twice with distilled water. Let the plate air-dry.When the plate is dry, take a picture of the plate using an imaging system (Figure 3).Count the number of plaques formed in each well with a marker pen.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190701/20190701184656_9037.jpgFigure 3.
