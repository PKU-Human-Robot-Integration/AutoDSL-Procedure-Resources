    "Note: In order to get enough ILC2 cells to perform various experiments, we generally purify ILC2s from 4 or 5 mice. In vivo treatment of micePrepare purified human recombinant IL-3395-270 as previously described by Lefrançais et al. (2014). Human IL-33 is a potent activator of mouse ST2+ cells (Cayrol et al., 2018).For each mouse, inject intraperitoneally 4 µg of human recombinant IL-3395-270 into a Rag2-/- mouse (diluted in DPBS; V = 100 μl/mouse), using an insulin syringe (0.3 ml; 30 G), five times at days 0, 1, 4, 5 and 6 (see Figure 1). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180926/20180926004641_8173.jpgFigure 1. A schematic view of the whole procedure. Rag2-/- mice were first treated with rIL-3395-270 to expand ILC2s in vivo (see Procedure A). Lin-CD45+ ILC2s are then isolated (see Procedure B) and cultured for several days (see Procedure C), before being used for subsequent ex vivo or in vivo experiments. ILC2 IsolationNotes:  Lympholyte®-M is a density separation medium. Put it at room temperature for at least 20 min before use, because the density of Lympholyte®-M is temperature dependent (Step B2).   At different steps during this procedure, 100 μl of cell suspensions is collected in a 96-well plate for subsequent FACS analysis. Keep that plate on ice, until Step B5.Preparing lung single-cell suspension For each mouse:Sacrifice the mouse on Day 7, remove the lungs and place them into a 15 ml Falcon® tube filled with 5 ml DMEM.Freshly prepare lung digestion solution (2 ml per mouse; see Recipes).Transfer the lungs into a Petri dish containing 500 μl of lung digestion solution and smoothly inject 500 μl of lung digestion solution into the lobes of the lung, using a 25 G needle mounted on a 1 ml syringe. The lung must swell (see Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Procedure of lung digestion.",
    "The video shows the injection of digestion solution into the lung. (All mice experiments were handled according to institutional guidelines under protocols approved by the French Ministry of Research and the FRBT (C2EA-01) animal care committee (projects 00663.02 and APAFIS#3873-2016020116301837v3)).Cut the lungs into small pieces using a scalpel and transfer the crushed lungs into a Falcon® 50 ml tube. Rinse the Petri dish with 1 ml of lung digestion solution and transfer to the 50 ml tube.Incubate the 50 ml tube containing the sample in a water bath at 37 °C for 1 h. Put a 70 μm cell strainer on a 50 ml tube; apply the sample on it and rinse the tube used for the digestion with 2 ml DPBS. In order to obtain a uniform single-cell suspension from tissue, grind the remaining tissue on the strainer with the plunger of a 2.5 ml syringe and wash the strainer with additional 2 ml DPBS.Enrichment of leucocyte population by density gradient separationDiscard the cell strainer and transfer the cell suspension into a Falcon® 15 ml tube.Centrifuge at 400 x g at room temperature for 5 min. Remove the supernatant from the samples and resuspend the cell pellet in 5 ml DPBS.Using Pasteur pipette, slowly add 5 ml Lympholyte®-M under the cell suspension (see Figure 2A).Centrifuge at 1,300 x g at room temperature for 20 min without any brake. For each sample, collect the cells of interest from the Lympholyte®-M/DPBS interface with a Pasteur pipette (see Figure 2B). Combine all samples in a single 15 ml Falcon® conical tube filled with 5 ml DPBS. This step enables the recovery of lymphoid cells and eliminates erythrocytes, dead cells and debris.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180926/20180926004658_1266.jpgFigure 2. Density gradient separation procedure. A. Before centrifugation, lymphoid cells are located in the cell suspension phase above the Lympholyte®-M. B.",
    "After centrifugation, lymphoid cells are concentrated in the interface between the DPBS buffer and the Lympholyte®-M. Red blood cells, dead cells and debris are found at the bottom of the tube.Enrichment of lineage negative populationCentrifuge at 400 x g at 4 °C for 5 min to pellet the cells.Note: Work under sterile conditions (hood) from this step. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 10 ml PEF buffer.Note: Take 100 μl of cell suspension for subsequent FACS analysis (see Figure 3A for gating strategy and Figure 3B-before purification). Count the cells using a hemocytometer. The typical recovered cell number is 20 x 106 per mouse.Centrifuge again at 400 x g at 4 °C for 5 min.Proceed with negative selection: deplete lineage positive cells using The EasySepTM Mouse Hematopoietic Cell Isolation Kit. This method uses biotinylated antibodies directed against non-hematopoietic stem cells and non-progenitor cells (CD5, CD11b, CD19, CD45R/B220, Ly6G/C(Gr-1), TER119) and streptavidin-coated magnetic particles. Follow the kit protocol to separate unlabeled cells (Lin-) using an EasySepTM magnet. At the end of this step, the cells of interest (Lin-) are recovered in a 15 ml tube.Repeat the depletion step with the EasySepTM magnet using the negative fraction containing Lin-ILC2sNote: Take 100 μl of each cellular fraction for subsequent FACS analysis (see Figure 3B-lineage depletion; first and second depletion). Selection of CD45+ populationCentrifuge at 400 x g at 4 °C for 5 min.Remove the supernatant, resuspend the cell pellet in 5 ml of PEB buffer and determine cell number using a hemocytometer. The typical recovered cell number is 3.7 x 106 per mouse.Proceed with CD45 positive selection: select CD45+ cells by using magnetic beads conjugated to anti-mouse CD45 monoclonal antibody, MS columns, MiniMACSTM separator and follow the recommendations of the manufacturer (Miltenyi Biotech).",
    "At the end of this step, the cells of interest (Lin-CD45+) are recovered. Note: Take 100 μl of cell suspension for subsequent FACS analysis (see Figure 3B-CD45 selection).  Centrifuge at 400 x g at 4 °C for 5 min.Remove the supernatant, resuspend cell pellet in 1 ml of ILC2 culture medium (see Recipes).Count cells by using a hemocytometer. Typically, we obtain 1.3 x 106 ILC2s per mouse.Proceed with ILC2s staining for FACS analysisFill wells of the 96-well plate containing cells from subsequent isolation steps with DPBS. Centrifuge the plate at 400 x g at 4 °C for 5 min and remove the supernatant.Perform the viability staining: resuspend cell pellets with 100 μl/well of Viability Dye-eFluor506 diluted to 1/1,000 in DPBS. Incubate for 30 min at 4 °C.Wash the cells: complete wells with FACS buffer (see Recipes), centrifuge the plate at 400 x g at 4 °C for 5 min and remove the supernatant.Resuspend cell pellets in 50 μl/well of the different antibodies (listed in Materials and Reagents #31-33) diluted in FACS staining buffer (containing Fc block and mouse serum). Incubate for 30 min at 4 °C.Repeat the washing step.Resuspend cell pellets in 100 μl of FACS buffer, transfer each sample to annotated FACS tubes and add 200 μl of FACS buffer (300 μl total volume).Proceed to FACS analyses (on a LSR II for example). We generally obtain an ILC2 population with about 90% of cells expressing typical ILC2s markers (Lin-CD45+ CD25+ CD90.2+ CD127+ Sca1+ ST2+). Note: Cell surface markers analysis after ILC2 isolation–see an example in Figures 3C and 3D.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180926/20180926004715_2546.jpgFigure 3.

    "ILC2 purification is analyzed by FACS at different steps: before purification, after depletion of lineage + cells, and after CD45 positive selection. Cells are gated on live single cells. Numbers indicate % among live cells. C. Analysis of cell surface markers after ILC2 isolation (Day 7). Cells are gated on live single cells. Numbers indicate % among Lin-CD45+ cells. D. Isotype controls are shown.ILC2 cultureThis step of ILC2 culture leads to increased numbers of ILC2s and a better degree of cell purity.Dilute cell suspension (from Step B4) in order to get 0.3 x 106 cells/ml.Distribute 3 ml of ILC2 cell suspension/well in a 6-well plate (Day 7). The day after (Day 8), in the morning, add another 3 ml ILC2 medium to each well. In the evening, pipet the cells up and down, and split them into 3 wells and add again 3 ml medium per well (total volume per well = 5 ml). At Day 11, collect cells by pipetting into 15 ml Falcon® tube, centrifuge at 400 x g for 5 min. Count cells with a hemocytometer. ILC2s are ready to be used for ex vivo or in vivo experiments. They can also be maintained in culture for up to 10 days at 0.4 x 106 cells/ml.Note: Take 100 μl of ILC2 cell suspension for subsequent FACS analysis (see Figure 4). Proceed to FACS analysis as described above (Step B5). We generally obtain an ILC2 population (13.6 x 106 cells per mouse) with > 95% of cells expressing typical ILC2s markers (Lin-CD45+ CD25+ CD90.2+ CD127+ Sca1+ ST2+). Note: See an example in Figure 4–Cell surface markers analysis after ILC2 isolation and culture.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180926/20180926004733_4053.jpgFigure 4.
