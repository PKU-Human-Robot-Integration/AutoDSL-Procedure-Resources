    "Without pre-charging the chamber, place the animal(s) in the chamber and introduce 100% carbon dioxide (whenever possible euthanize animals in their home cage). Open the CO2 tank or valve regulator to initiate flow of gas. A fill rate of about 10% to 30% of the chamber volume per minute with carbon dioxide, added to the existing air in the chamber should be appropriate to achieve a balanced gas mixture to fulfill the objective of rapid unconsciousness with minimal distress to the animals. Wait approximately 3-5 min for animal to stop moving or breathing. Maintain CO2 flow for a minimum of 1 min after respiration ceases. Death was confirmed by cervical dislocation.   Open the abdominal cavity using operating scissors to remove the cecum. Using operating scissors, keep the cecum intact by carefully excising to not lose any contents.    Open the cecum with operating scissors and add the cecal contents to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube on ice.    Take cecal contents and dilute 1:10 in PBS (w/v). Add chloroform in a final concentration of 3% (v/v).    Incubate the cecal contents/chloroform mixture by shaking at 200 rpm at 37 Â°C for 30 min.   Allow the chloroform to settle to the bottom of the tube at room temperature (approximately 20 min).    Remove top aqueous layer to recover the spores and add to a sterile 1.5 ml tube. Be careful not to take any chloroform that has settled to the bottom of the tube."
