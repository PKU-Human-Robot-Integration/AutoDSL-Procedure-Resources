    "Note: The experiment utilizes radioactive material and operators require experience in personal and environmental radiation protection and in the management of radioactive waste. Cell nuclei isolationRNA polymerase I activity can be measured in nuclei isolated from cultured cell lines or from fresh or frozen tissues, in this context, the standard procedure of nuclei isolation from cultured cells is described.Grow the desired cell line in the required culture medium on cell culture flasks until reaching about 50 x 106 cells at least.Note: Cells may be subjected to specific treatment, grown under special conditions or various cell lines compared.Harvest cells by scraper in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), using 10 ml of PBS every 10 x 106 cells and collect the volume of scraped cells in 50 ml plastic tubes.From this point keep cells cold at all time.Centrifuge for 10 min at 3,000 x g at 4 °C to pellet cells. Discard the supernatant.Wash the cell pellet with 20 ml of cold PBS, then centrifuge for 10 min at 3,000 x g at 4 °C and discard the supernatant.Suspend the cells in 10 ml of homogenization solution and disrupt cytoplasmic membranes and cytoplasm by homogenization with pestle and potter tissue grinder with a motor driven device: 5 strokes might be sufficient.Let the homogenized cells stand on ice for 10 min.At this point check whether the cytoplasmic membranes are broken up and the nuclei are intact and cytoplasm free. Mount approximately 10-20 μl of homogenized cells on a slide and observe with an optical microscope (Figure 1). If necessary you can repeat the homogenization step without exceeding the 10 strokes.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170124/20170124222640_7114.jpgFigure 1.

    "By comparing with figure A, in B it is observable the breakage of cytoplasmic membranes and the loss of cell morphology. The nuclei are evident and intact. Arrowheads indicate cytoplasmic debris around nuclei, these residues can be removed by washing. A Zeiss Primovert inverted microscope was used. 200x magnification.Transfer the homogenized sample to a tube and centrifuge for 10 min at 3,000 x g at 4 °C to pellet nuclei and discard any cytoplasmic residues in the supernatant. Wash the nuclei by adding 5 ml of washing solution and centrifuge for 10 min at 3,000 x g at 4 °C. Remove supernatant completely.Add 1 ml of suspension solution, mix by pipetting, take 0.1 ml of suspended nuclei and transfer it into another tube to extract and quantify hydrolyzed DNA. Use the remaining volume to assay in vitro RNA polymerase I activity.In vitro assessment of RNA polymerase I activityA high ionic strength medium in presence of α-amanitin is used to evaluate RNA polymerase I. In a high ionic strength medium both RNA polymerase I and II are active, however, RNA polymerase II is inhibited by α-amanitin (Novello and Stirpe, 1970).The measurement of each sample is carried out in triplicate accompanied by two blanks.Prepare 10 ml glass tubes, each tube must contain a final volume of 500 μl.Add in the following order:100 μl of 5x high ionic strength buffer90 μl of nucleoside triphosphate mixture1 μl of 1 mg/ml of α-amanitin solutionMilliQ H2O to 400 μl 100 μl of nucleiNote: Add nuclei to the tubes as the last element, vortex very fast and start reaction time immediately.Incubate all the samples for 10 min at 37 °C in a water bath with shaking at 100 rpm.After 10 min, stop the reaction using 5 ml of 10% (w/w) TCA and putting tubes on ice.",
    "Keep tubes on ice until the filtration step.Notes: To prepare blank samples, add nuclei to the tubes and immediately block the reaction with 5 ml of 10% (w/w) trichloroacetic acid (TCA), then incubate for 10 min at 37 °C and after that put tubes on ice.Whereas RNA polymerase I activity accounts for at least 60% of the cell transcriptional activity, RNA polymerase III contributes to a very small percentage of the cell transcriptional activity and this assay is not optimal to discriminate its activity, so it is not taken into account. To completely exclude RNA polymerase III activity an α-amanitin dose ten times more concentrated than the one which inhibits RNA polymerase II is required (at least a final concentration of 10 μg/ml).Using a high ionic strength medium it is possible to measure both RNA polymerase I and II: RNA polymerase II activity may be obtained from the difference between the measurements in the absence and in the presence of α-amanitin.It is also possible to discriminate and evaluate the RNA polymerase I activity using a low ionic strength reaction mixture (see Recipe 15), which is optimal for RNA polymerase I enzyme, but not for RNA polymerase II.Newly synthesized rRNA collection and measurementTCA precipitates nucleic acid molecules, including newly synthesized 3H-labelled rRNA, which can be collected on a glass-fiber filter and measured in a liquid scintillation counter.To prepare for a vacuum filtration, gather together a 2,000 ml filter flask and a vacuum glass filter holder for 25 mm disc filters, connect the side arm of filter flask to a vacuum pump using vacuum tubing. Assemble the apparatus placing a wet glass microfiber filter disc on the base (Figure 2). The filter discs are wetted with 5% (w/w) TCA.",
    "Pour a sample in the funnel, turn the vacuum pump on until the entire sample has passed through the filter and funnel base. Rinse the filter with 5% (w/w) TCA, 10 ml each wash for 5 washings.Note: The collected liquid in the filter flask contains most of the radioactivity.Turn the vacuum pump off, remove the funnel and using forceps place the filter in a scintillation plastic vial containing 10 ml of scintillation liquid.Repeat steps C2 and C3 for each sample tube.Shake the vials vigorously and put them in a liquid scintillation counter to measure the radioactivity of the samples.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170124/20170124223151_1675.jpgFigure 2. Assembly of the filtration system. A and B. Apparatus components: filter flask (1), glass microfiber filter discs (2), funnel (3), glass support base (4) inserted in a perforated stopper (5), forceps (6) and clamp (7). C. The stopper with glass support base is inserted in the flask opening. TCA wet glass microfiber filter is placed on the base. D. The funnel is put on the filter and stopped with the clamp. The side arm of the filter flask is connected to a vacuum pump by a vacuum tubing.Nuclear DNA extraction and quantificationThe following procedure is based on what reported by Munro and Fleck (1966).Use 0.1 ml of suspended nuclei to extract and quantify hydrolyzed DNA.Collect 0.1 ml of nuclei and transfer it into a 10 ml glass tube.Add 0.5 ml of 0.6 N perchloric acid (PCA), vortex the sample a few seconds and centrifuge for 10 min at 3,000 x g at 4 °C. Remove and discard the supernatant containing single nucleotides and oligonucleotides, not included in DNA and RNA molecules that are soluble in weakly acid solution. Maintain pellet containing nuclear RNA molecules and DNA.Add 0.5 ml of 0.",
    "3 N potassium hydroxide (KOH) to pellet, vortex the sample and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C in a water bath with shaking to hydrolyze RNA.Note: In alkaline environment RNA is susceptible to base-catalyzed hydrolysis while DNA is chemically stable.Add 50 μl of 6 N PCA to solubilize ribonucleotides and precipitate macromolecules that are still present. Centrifuge for 10 min at 3,000 x g at 4 °C, discard supernatant containing hydrolyzed RNA and retain pellet containing DNA.Add to pellet 0.5 ml of 7% (w/w) PCA, vortex the sample to suspend and incubate for 15 min at 70 °C in a water bath with shaking to hydrolyze DNA into deoxynucleotides.Note: Acid solution and heating liberate deoxynucleotides, which are recoverable in supernatant after centrifugation.Centrifuge for 10 min at 3,000 x g at 4 °C. Transfer the supernatant containing hydrolyzed DNA to a 1.5 ml tube.Use spectrophotometric measurements at the 260 nm wavelengths to quantitate the amount of hydrolyzed DNA.DNA concentration is calculated multiplying absorbance at 260 nm, normalized to a 10 mm path length, by a factor of 20:DNA (μg/ml) = (OD260nm/NF) x 20Where,OD260nm (Optical Density): absorbance at the indicated wavelength,NF (Normalization Factor): factor to normalize to a 10 mm path length, for example, if path length is 1 mm the normalization factor is 10,Factor 20: 1 OD at 260 nm corresponds to approximately 20 μg/ml for oligonucleotides."
