    "Cut the rice leaf blade into pieces measuring ≤ 2 mm in length and immediately immerse them in a fixative solution. The fixative solution should be handled under a fume hood.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160229/20160229064447_3412.jpgFigure 1. Embedding and trimming. a. Equipment and reagent. b. The tissues in the bottom of gelatin capsules filled with fresh 100% LR White resin. c. Polymerization. d. Trimming.The tissue/fixative is placed in a desiccator, which is connected to a diaphragm vacuum pump. The tissue/fixative is vacuum degasified for 1 min at room temperature using the vacuum pump before releasing the vacuum very slowly. Incubate the tissue/fixative for 2 h at 4 °C.Rinse the tissues gently three times with 50 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 15 min each time. The tissues are dehydrated using a graded ethanol series (70%, 80%, 90%, and three times at 100%) at 4 °C for 30 min in each solution. Swirl occasionally.Immerse the tissues three times with a 50:50 mixture of 100% (v/v) ethanol and 100% (v/v) LR White resin for 30 min each time at room temperature.Transfer the tissues to 100% LR White resin and immerse the tissues three times for 1 h each time at room temperature. This step ensures that no residual ethanol will be carried over since other chemical like ethanol or else prevents polymerization of LR resin.The tissues are settled to the bottom of gelatin capsules filled with fresh 100% LR White resin (Figure 1b). Stand the gelatin capsules in the test-tube rack for polymerization overnight at 50 °C (Figure 1c). Turn the tissue block upside down and secure it in a UCT ultramicrotome. Chuck and trim the block to expose the tissue surface area up to 1.0 sq mm using a razor blade (Figure 1d).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160229/20160229064516_7473.jpgFigure 2.

    "Mounting the ultrathin sections on the grid.Cut the block to 80 nm with a diamond knife on a UCT ultramicrotome (Figure 2a). Dip up the serial sections floating on water in the boat of the diamond knife with a nickel grid mesh, and mount the ultrathin sections on the grid (Figure 2b). Incubate the grid with a droplet of the mouse anti-(1;3,1;4)-β-D-glucan antibody (diluted 1:1,000 in a 1% BSA solution, depending on the abundance of the target primary antibody) at room temperature for 90 min (Figure 3a). Rinse the grid three times with 1% BSA/1x PBS for 1 min each time.Float the grid on a droplet of goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to 15-nm gold particles 1:20 in 1% BSA/1x PBS at room temperature for 1 h. When detecting another primary antibody, prepare goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to gold particles to match the primary antibody.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160229/20160229064609_9746.jpgFigure 3. Immunostaining (a) and staining with uranyl acetate (b)Rinse the grid and the sections three times with 1x PBS.Immerse the grid and the sections in 2% glutaraldehyde solution and are air-dried under a fume hood.Immerse the sections in a droplet of 2% uranyl acetate, which had been prepared by diluting with distilled water, for 15 min (Figure 3b).Rinse the sections with distilled water.Immerse the sections with Lead stain solution at room temperature for 3 min. Rinse the sections with distilled water.Observe the sections using a JEOL JEM 1200EX transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. Digital images (2,048 x 2,048 pixels) are obtained with a CCD camera."
