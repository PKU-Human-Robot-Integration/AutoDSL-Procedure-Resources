    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCell seeding and transfection\nTiming: 2 days\nDuring this step HEK293T cells are seeded in 48-well plates for the subsequent TransIT-LT1 transfection (Mirus Bio) of the reporter and viral plasmids. We recommend to replace the cells after a limited number of passaging steps (10–15) with freshly thawed cryostocks of a low passage.\nCritical: The cells have to be free of mycoplasma or bacterial contamination, see also before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] section.\nDetach HEK293T cells with trypsin and count living cells using dye exclusion (Erythrosin B or Trypan blue Stain). Adjust the concentration and volume of the trypsinized cells in DMEMxxx for the seeding.\nNote: Avoid over-trypsinization. Typically, we prepare 10% extra volume of trypsinized cells to ensure that every well receives the correct number of cells and there is a little leftover after seeding.\nSeed 4×104 cells in 48-well plates in 250 μL DMEMxxx per well to achieve 60–70% confluency the next day. Discard the leftover of the seeding solution.\nIncubate for 18 h at 37°C and 5% CO2 in a humid atmosphere.\nNote: Plan your seeding well and seed enough wells with cells to ensure that samples can be transfected at least in triplicates.\nCritical: For an optimal transfection efficiency, cell confluency should be between 60 - 70%. Transfection efficiency suffers if the cells are too confluent and cell viability is dramatically decreased if the cells are too sparsely seeded.\nTransfect the HEK293T cells 18 h post seeding using TransIT-LT1 (https://www.mirusbio.com/products/transfection/transit-lt1-transfection-reagent[href=https://www.mirusbio.com/products/transfection/transit-lt1-transfection-reagent]). Alternatively, other Lipofection reagents, e.g., Lipofectamin 3000 may also be used.",
    "Prepare the mix of DNA constructs in 25 μL Opti-MEM for one 48-well according to Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]. The transfection mixture may also be prepared in PBS or any other buffer that does not contain FCS, which would impair formation of the transfection complexes.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1023_7.csv\nFill up each mix to the same amount of total DNA with e.g., empty vector.\nAdd TransIT-LT1 (3 μL TransIT-LT1 per μg DNA, for 370 ng DNA add 1.1 μL TransIT-LT1/ 48-well) to the DNA-Opti-MEM mixture and mix by pipetting up and down.\nIncubate for 15 min at 20°C–25°C.\nCritical: Transfection complexes are stable for approximately 30 minutes in the reaction mixture. Finish your transfection before.\nCarefully add the transfection mixture dropwise to the cells. There is no need to wash the cells before addition of the transfection mixture.\nOptional: To reduce cytotoxic effects, change the medium very carefully to fresh growth medium 4–6 h post transfection.\nNote: If this assay is performed with a large number of samples, we recommend using a master mix to ensure that each sample received the same amount of the F-Luc reporter plasmid and the normalization control plasmids.\nStimulation with IFNs\nTiming: 8–48 h\nThis step describes how interferon signaling is induced in HEK293T cells co-transfected with the respective reporter plasmid, the normalization plasmid and plasmids expressing viral proteins as described above.\nStimulate the cells with IFNs\nNote: Amount of IFN and timing depend on the respective pathway that will be induced and should be determined before you begin with the experiment. Our suggestions are given in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\nReplace the growth medium in the wells with 200 μL per well of DMEMxxx containing the respective IFN in the appropriate amount (see table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]).",
    "Replace the growth medium of the negative control (no stimulation) with 200 μL per well of DMEMxxx lacking the stimulant.\nIncubate for 8–48 h (suggestion given in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]), depending on the stimulant used.\nOptional: Monitor the cells for cell death by visual inspection, the CellTiter-Glo assay (performed later) will give a quantitative evaluation of cell viability.\nQuantification of luciferase activity\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThis step describes how signaling of type I, II and III interferons was quantified using F-Luc reporters controlled by the respective promoters. In addition, three alternative normalization measurements are described, based on either cell viability (CellTiter-Glo), R-Luc expression (pGAPDH-R-Luc), or G-Luc expression (pTAL-G-Luc). Cell viability measurements are based on ATP metabolization in the cell lysate. Dead cells metabolize less. The pGAPDH-R-Luc construct harbors the R-Luc reporter controlled by the human GAPDH promoter sequence. The plasmid pTAL-G-Luc contains a TATA-like promoter (pTAL) region from the Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) that is not responsive to NF-κB (Sauter et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]).\nCritical: R-Luc and F-Luc can be measured in the same well. You need at least 50 μL cell lysate (25μL for F-Luc/R-Luc and 25μL for cell viability) if normalization to cell viability is required, since it is not possible to measure F-Luc and cell viability in the same sample well. G-Luc measurements are performed in the supernatants of the samples. Thus, supernatants have to be transferred to fresh white 96-well plates (Nunc F96 MicroWell white plates) prior to lysis of the cells (step 13). Additionally, it is essential to use a luminometer with automated reagent injectors to perform this assay as the Gaussia substrate is processed quickly and therefore all samples should be measured directly after substrate addition.",
    "Pause point: Cells and supernatant can be stored separately at −20°C to −80°C for a few days before measuring luciferase activity.\nCell lysis\nRemove supernatant and add 100 μL 1× Passive Lysis Buffer per 48-well. Keep the supernatant if G-Luc normalization will be performed, otherwise discard.\nShake gently for 15 min at 20°C–25°C until a fluffy white precipitate is formed.\nOptional: Freeze and thaw the plate at −20°C to improve cell lysis and have a more uniform signal.\nPause point: The cell lysates in 1× PLB can be stored at −20°C to −80°C for a few days before measuring luciferase activity.\nTo analyze the reporter gene expression, perform a Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay using the modified manufactures instructions: (https://www.promega.de/Products/luciferase-assays/Reporter-Assays/Dual_Glo-Luciferase-Assay-System/?catNum=E2920[href=https://www.promega.de/Products/luciferase-assays/Reporter-Assays/Dual_Glo-Luciferase-Assay-System/?catNum=E2920])\nTransfer 25 μL of cell lysate into a type white 96-well plate.\nAdd one volume (25 μL) of the Dual-Glo Luciferase Reagent. Shake cautiously and incubate for at least 10 min at 20°C–25°C in the dark.\nMeasure the F-Luc signal with a Luminometer using standard settings, 0.1 s measurement time per well on an Orion II microplate Luminometer (Berthold). The measurement should be performed within 30 min.\nQuantify the signal of your internal control (normalization) of choice.\nFor R-Luc normalization:\nR-Luc measurements are performed in the same sample as the F-Luc assay. Reuse the plate from step 17.\nAdd one volume (25 μL) of Dual-Glo Stop & Glo Reagent. Shake cautiously and incubate for at least 10 min at 20°C–25°C in the dark.\nMeasure the R-Luc signal with a Luminometer using standard settings, 0.1 s measurement time per well on an Orion II microplate Luminometer (Berthold). The measurement should be performed within 30 min.\nFor Cell Viability normalization: Perform CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay using modified manufactures instructions: (https://www.promega.de/products/cell-health-assays/cell-viability-and-cytotoxicity-assays/celltiter_glo-luminescent-cell-viability-assay/?catNum=G7570[href=https://www.promega.de/products/cell-health-assays/cell-viability-and-cytotoxicity-assays/celltiter_glo-luminescent-cell-viability-assay/?catNum=G7570])\nTransfer 25 μL of cell lysate into a type white 96-well plate.",
    "Add one volume (25 μL) of CellTiter-Glo Reagent.\nShake cautiously and incubate for at least 10 min at 20°C–25°C in the dark.\nMeasure luciferase signal using the Orion II microplate Luminometer (Berthold) within 30 min.\nFor G-Luc normalization:\nPrepare Coelenterazine solution as described in the buffers and media[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.2] section of the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] chapter and store it as 100 μL aliquots at −80°C.\nPrepare Gaussia substrate by thawing one aliquot (100 μL) and mixing it with 20 mL 1× PBS. This amount is sufficient for measuring two full 96-well plates plates.\nPrime the luminometer (Orion II microplate Luminometer, Berthold):\nInsert an external priming container/plate into the luminometer.\nPlace the reagent injector cable in a tube with ultrapure water.\nPrime the injectors with water using standard settings.\nPlace the reagent injector cable in a tube containing the previously prepared Gaussia substrate.\nPrime the injectors with the Gaussia substrate as recommended by the manufacturer of your device.\nRemove the external priming container/plate.\nTransfer 25 μL of supernatant into a type white 96-well plate and agitate gentle to evenly distribute the sample within the well.\nSet volume of injected substrate to 50 μL substrate per sample and record G-Luc activity over a period of 1 s per sample with a delay of 2 s following substrate addition.\nInsert the plate and start the measurement.\nConfirm expression levels of viral proteins by western blotting\nTiming: 1–3 days",
    "To assess the expression of the viral proteins, immunoblotting analysis can be used. Ideally, expression analysis is done before the reporter gene assay to allow adjustment of transfected DNA amounts of the viral gene expression plasmids to ensure similar expression levels. We additionally recommend to perform expression analysis of the viral proteins after every reporter gene assay. Using the same protein tag on each protein ensures similar detection via a tag-directed antibody. We have used the strep II tag, but any similar setup like (3×)FLAG or (3×)HA tags are feasible. We recommend having the viral proteins expressed from the same vector, ideally codon-optimized to avoid drastic differences in expression levels.\nPause point: Lysates may be stored at −20 to −80°C for weeks to months.\nUse the cell lysates from step 13 to confirm proper expression of the viral proteins by western blotting. A more detailed protocol for Western blotting is available elsewhere (Hayn et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Koepke et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nTransfer 30 μL of the lysates to a tube and pellet the cell debris at 20,000 g, 4°C for 20 min.\nQuantify protein amount using a BCA assay (e.g., Pierce Rapid Gold BCA Protein Assay Kit; https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/MAN0017135_PierceRapidGoldBCAProteinAssayKit_UG.pdf[href=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/MAN0017135_PierceRapidGoldBCAProteinAssayKit_UG.pdf]) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and adjust samples to the same protein concentration using 1×Passive Lysis Buffer. Usually we adjust to 1 μg/μL.\nTransfer a volume equal to 10μg of total protein to fresh tubes and add 6× SDS-PAGE Loading buffer to reach a final concentration of 1×.\nNote: The amount of protein can be decreased or increased depending on the expected expression levels. Typically, 10μg of total protein are a good starting point. Equal amounts of each sample need to be taken.\nBoil the lysates at 95°C for 10 min to denature the proteins.",
    "Vortex briefly, spin down and load one lysate per pocket in a NuPAGE 4%–12% Bis-Tris Gel. Load a pre-stained protein marker to estimate the size of the viral proteins.\nRun the gel at 90 V for 90 min in 1× MES-SDS running buffer.\nAfter the electrophoresis, transfer the proteins to a PVDF membrane using semi-dry western blotting, as detailed in (Koepke et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nAfter blotting, disassemble the setup and place the membrane in 1% casein in PBS to block any free protein binding sites for 60 min at 20°C–25°C while gently agitating.\nIncubate the membrane with an anti-strep II-tag antibody (Polyclonal rabbit anti-strep II-tag antibody, 1 to 2,000 diluted in PBS-T with 0.05% Casein) at 4°C for 16–24 h.\nNote: As the anti-strep-II antibody and the anti-GAPDH antibody (used in step 34) were raised in different species, they may be combined in one step for staining. However, we have found that separate staining reduces the background in the Western Blots.\nWash the membrane three times for 5 min in PBS-T.\nIncubate the membrane with a secondary antibody (IRDye 680RD goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody, 1 to 20,000 diluted in PBS-T with 0.05% Casein) for 30 min at 20°C–25°C.\nWash the membrane three times for 5 min in PBS-T.\nQuantify the fluorescence of the secondary antibody using a Li-Cor Odyssey Scanner.\nWash the membrane three times for 5 min in PBS-T.\nIncubate the membrane with an anti-GAPDH antibody (Monoclonal rat anti-GAPDH antibody, 1 to 1,000 diluted in PBS-T with 0.05% Casein) for 1.5 h at 20°C–25°C.\nWash the membrane three times for 5 min in PBS-T.\nIncubate the membrane with a secondary antibody (IRDye 800CW goat anti-rat IgG secondary antibody, 1 to 20,000 diluted in PBS-T with 0.05% Casein) for 30 min at 20°C–25°C.",
    "Quantify the fluorescence of the secondary antibody using a Li-Cor Odyssey Scanner.\nCritical: All viral proteins should be expressed to similar levels to allow proper comparison of their effects on the signaling pathways. See below for hints if similar expression levels are not reached."
