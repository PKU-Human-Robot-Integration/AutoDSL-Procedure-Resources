    "All mouse experiments strictly followed protocols (SIAT-IRB-160520-YYS-FXJ-A0232) approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n1. Synthesis of Placental Chondroitin Sulfate A-Targeted Lipid-Polymer Nanoparticles\nSynthesize MTX- and ICG-loaded lipid-polymer nanoparticles (MNPs and INPs respectively) and plCSA-BP-conjugated nanoparticles (plCSA-MNPs and plCSA-INPs) as described in detail elsewhere18.\n2. In vivo Fluorescence Imaging\nPreparation of pregnant mice\nPlace female CD-1 mice (8-12 weeks) with a fertile male of the same strain in one cage (male: female=1:2) in the afternoon and check the vaginal plugs the following morning. If a vaginal plug is observed, define the mouse as embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5).\nHouse pregnant mice alone in a pathogen-free animal room with a 14 h light/10 h dark cycle and provide free access to food and water until E14.5.\nIntravenous injection of nanoparticles\nBefore the procedure, sterilize the nanoparticles by filtration through a 0.22 μm syringe filter. Weigh the pregnant mouse at E11.5 to determine the quantity and volume of nanoparticle injection.\n\t\tNote: The nanoparticle injection volume should be less than 1% (volume/weight) of the body weight of the pregnant mouse. For example, the nanoparticle injection volume should be less than 0.25 mL in a 25 g mouse.\nTo dilate the tail vein, warm the tail for 5-10 min with a heating pad.\nBefore injection, aspirate the INPs or plCSA-INPs into a 28 g insulin syringe.\nTransfer the pregnant mouse to a holding device that restrains the mouse while allowing access to the tail vein. Clean the tail with an alcohol swab. Then insert the syringe into the tail vein. Slowly inject the INPs or plCSA-INPs (5 mg/kg ICG equivalent) with even pressure over 5-10 s.",
    "Note: Stop injecting if a blister appears on the tail because this outcome indicates that the needle is not in the vein. Syringes should not be shared between mice to minimize disease transmission and cross-contamination.\nRecord the injection time. Meanwhile, apply gentle pressure to the injection site until the bleeding stops, which normally takes 30-60 s.\nIn vivo imaging\n30 min after the injection, image the pregnant mice using the in vivo fluorescence imaging system.\nAnesthetize the pregnant mice with an oxygen flow rate of 1.0 L/min and isoflurane at 2-4% in an associated chamber of the anesthesia unit and verify full anesthesia by slow and regular breathing. Then, move them into the imaging chamber. Place the anesthetized pregnant mice into the imaging chamber, keeping the animals in a supine position.\nPlace a nose cone over the mouth and nose to allow the inhalation of 1-2% isoflurane with an oxygen flow rate of 1.0 L/min to maintain anesthesia.\nSelect 2D-fluorescence and photographic parameters to image the ICG fluorescence signals. Set the exposure to auto and the excitation/emission wavelengths to 710/820 nm.\nAt the end of the imaging procedure, turn off the isoflurane influx to stop the anesthesia, and carefully return the pregnant mice to their cages.\n48 h after nanoparticle injection, anesthetize the pregnant mice with isofluorane, and then sacrifice the dam by cervical dislocation. Collect the fetuses and placentas using Graefe forceps, Graefe tissue forceps, and dissecting scissors.\nPlace the placentas and fetuses into the imaging chamber, and image using the method described in step 2.3.4.\n3. HFUS Evaluation of Embryonic Development\nAnimal models\nObtain and prepare the pregnant mice as described in step 2.1.",
    "Use HFUS to image pregnant mice at E 6.5 (Protocols 3.2 and 3.3.3). First, confirm pregnancy by visualizing embryos on day E6.5, and then randomly allocate the pregnant mice into three groups: the MNP group, plCSA-MNP group, and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) group.\nInject PBS, MNPs or plCSA-MNPs (1 mg/kg MTX equivalent) into the tail veins of the pregnant mice every other day starting at E6.5 as described in step 2.2.\nPreparation for imaging\n24 h after the injection of nanoparticles, image the pregnant mice using the HFUS imaging system.\nAnesthetize the pregnant mice as described in step 2.3.2. Turn on the integrated temperature controls of the imaging platform and preheat the platform to 37-42 °C. Secure the pregnant mice in a supine position on the platform using tape.\nPlace the nose cone connected to the anesthesia unit over the snout. Apply 2% isoflurane with an oxygen flow rate of 1.0 L/min to maintain steady anesthesia.\nChemically remove hair from the abdomen using a depilatory cream. Wipe out the residual cream thoroughly with water-soaked gauze, and then coat the abdomen with acoustic coupling gel.\nImaging procedure\nPlace the 40 MHz transducer in the mechanical arm.\nAdjust the transducer position to obtain longitudinal images of the fetus and placenta with the region of interest located in the focal zone.\nB-Mode imaging and analysis\n\t\tNote: See Movie 1.\n\t\t\nClick the B-Mode button and lower the transducer over the abdomen until the fetus and placenta come into view. Press Scan/Freeze to initiate/stop imaging, press Cine store to store the cine loop, and press Frame store to store frame images.\nClick the Measure button to analyze the gestational sac length (GS), fetal crown rump length (CRL), biparietal diameter (BPD), abdominal circumference (AC), placental diameter (PD) and placental thickness (PT).\nPW-Doppler imaging and analysis",
    "Note: See Movie 1.\n\t\t\nUsing the same scan projection, click the PW button, place the sampling volume box in the center of the umbilical artery, and press Scan/Freeze to initiate imaging. Click Cine store to collect umbilical artery images.\nClick the Measure button to calculate the umbilical artery peak velocity (UA).\nColor Doppler mode imaging and analysis\nUsing the same scan projection, click the Color button and adjust the transducer position to obtain images of the fetal heart. Press Scan/freeze to initiate imaging and Cine store to collect images.\nClick the Measure button to calculate the fetal heart rate (HR).\n4. HPLC Analysis\nTissue preparation\nInject the pregnant mice with a single dose of MNPs or plCSA-MNPs (1 mg/kg MTX equivalent) at late pregnancy (e.g., E14.5) as described in step 3.1.3.\nAfter 24 h, anesthetize the mice by an intraperitoneal injection of avertin at 240 μg/body weight (g). Ensure no response to a foot pinch to verify that the mice are fully anesthetized.\nSpray the chest area with 75% ethanol. Perform cardiac perfusion (cut the right atria and perfuse through the left ventricle) as previously described in detail19,20 with 50 mL of ice-cold 0.9% saline for 10 min to remove unbound nanoparticles.\nEuthanize the dam. Perform a cesarean section to collect the fetuses and placentas using Graefe forceps, dissecting scissors, and Graefe tissue forceps, and store the tissues at -80 °C prior to analysis.\nPrepare the homogenization solution (10% perchloric acid) and keep on ice. Collect approximately 200 mg of tissue, and add 500 μL of homogenization solution to each sample. Homogenize the samples using a homogenizer at full speed for 30 s, and repeat this procedure twice.",
    "Centrifuge the samples at 14,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. Filter the supernatant (approximately 300 μL) through a 0.45 μm syringe filter, and transfer the resulting liquid to an HPLC vial. Place sample vials into an autosampler tray for injection.\nPreparation of standards\nPrepare the following solution for the mobile phase: 40 mM potassium phosphate dibasic (pH 4.5) and acetonitrile (88:12, v/v). Filter the solution through a 0.45 μm pore size syringe filter and transfer the resulting liquid to a clean HPLC reservoir bottle.\n\t\tNote: Adjust the pH with 0.1 M phosphoric acid. Use ultrasonic vibration for 15 min to degas the mobile phase each time prior to use.\nWeigh 10 mg of MTX into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. Add 1 mL of 1 M sodium hydroxide.\nVortex at high speed until the MTX dissolves completely.\n\t\tNote: This is the primary stock and can be stored at -20 °C for several months.\nTo create the secondary MTX stock (500 μg/mL), dilute 50 μL of the primary stock in 950 μL of the mobile phase.\n\t\tNote: Store on ice until use, and prepare fresh daily. It is important to use the mobile phase for the preparation of standards to avoid peaks resulting from mixing dissimilar solutions after sample injection.\nMake further dilutions to create the standards (Table 1). Store the standards on ice and prepare fresh daily. Run the standards in series with the experimental samples.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nNumber,Final concentration (μg/mL),\"500 μg/mL standard, μL\",Mobile phase(μL)\n1,0.5,1,999\n2,1,2,998\n3,2.5,5,995\n4,10,20,980\n5,25,50,950\n6,50,100,900\n7,100,200,800\nTable 1.

    "Note: Samples were analyzed on an HPLC system equipped with a solvent pump, a UV spectrophotometric detector (313 nm), and a C18 column (250×4.6 mm, 5 μm particle size).\n\t\nTurn on the HPLC degasser to remove air from the system. Turn on the flow, equilibrating the column with the mobile phase for 30 min to reduce baseline noise.\nSet the temperature of the column to 25 °C, inject 20 μL sample volumes at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, and click the Run Method to start the analysis.\nWhen the runs are complete, manually change the mobile phase to HPLC-grade acetonitrile. Run for approximately 15 min to protect the system.\n\t\tNote: Failure to perform this step following the recommended running time could result in damage to the column.\nFor quantitative analysis, calculate the areas under the standard MTX peaks of interest using the HPLC system software.\nSubscription Required.
