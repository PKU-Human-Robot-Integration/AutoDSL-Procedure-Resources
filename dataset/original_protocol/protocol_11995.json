    "All animal experiments reported here are conducted according to the European Guidelines for animal welfare (2010/63/EU) with approval by the Niedersächsisches Landesamt für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit (LAVES), registration number 14/1701.\n1. Study Design\nAs animal behavior work requires careful planning, consider the following parameters while designing the experiment.\n\t\nNumber of animals needed per group.\n\t\t\nUse a statistical software (e.g., PASS, EDA, or GPower) to calculate the required group size.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The group size depends on the variation between animals and the severity of the phenotype. For the kinematic gait analysis, the number of mice is usually 10 - 20 per group.\nSex of the experimental animals.\n\t\t\nConsider the effect of estrogen levels on the experiment, depending on the animal strain.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Many behavior studies focus on males in order to avoid the influence of estrogen levels on the experiment. These influences are more or less strong depending on the animal background strain.\nIf both sexes will be used, test for sex influence and evaluate the two sexes independently when necessary.\nAge of the experimental animals.\n\t\t\nUse adult animals (2 months of age, or older) if only one-time point is needed.\nSelect several time points when change in motor behavior with advancing age is to be studied. The earliest possible time point is 1 month, after mice are weaned from their mothers. Test the animals in regular intervals, e.g., every 1, 2, or 3 months.\nApply for authorization from the local authorities to perform animal behavior testing.\nMake plans for procuring the test animals.\n\t\nMake a breeding plan or contact an animal distributor in a timely manner so that enough experimental animals are available on the day when the experiments start.\nAllow the animals to habituate for one week if they are kept in a new room/setting during the experiments.",
    "2. Video Recording\nNOTE: To illustrate the use of kinematic gait analysis, here a commercially available imaging system with its accompanying imaging and analysis software (see the Table of Materials) are used.\nStart the computer and the imager software.\nDetermine the health status and well-being of each animal by observing it in its home cage, and weighing it on a balance.\nWhen needed, gently apply red finger paint to the animal's paws with a brush. Allow the paint to dry for ~5 min in a spare clean cage.\n\tNOTE: Avoid painting the animal's abdomen as the paint is used to enhance the contrast between paws and body. It is useful to have black finger paint handy for corrections. This step is needed for animals with brown fur, or in case the paws have been tattooed for identification. If chosen to paint the paws of one animal, all animals in the same group and control group need to be painted as well.\nSet the speed of the treadmill on the top right panel of the apparatus; If more than one running speed will be applied, start with the slowest speed first.\nPlace the animal in the test chamber (avoid clamping the tail or paws when closing the chamber). Cover the chamber with a dark cloth and allow each animal to adjust for 1 - 2 min.\nTurn on the light in the test chamber by turning the treadmill light rotary switch to the \"on\" position. Turn the treadmill rotary switch to \"forward\" to start the treadmill, then click the \"record\" button in the imager software.",
    "NOTE: While the treadmill is running, it is important to observe animal performance carefully and constantly: stop the treadmill immediately if the animal cannot keep up with the treadmill speed, or shows secondary symptoms non-related to locomotion (e.g., epileptic seizures). Testing conditions may need to be readjusted.\nWhen the animal runs stably (no quick escapes to the sides, front, or back), record for at least 5 s before stopping the treadmill. Stop recording by clicking \"stop\" on the imager software, and turn the treadmill rotary switch back to the \"off\" position.\n\tNOTE: To avoid unstable running of animals it can be helpful to let them run for several seconds, or to allow them to run in the other direction (by turning the treadmill rotary switch to \"reverse\" instead of \"forward\").\nClick the \"processing\" button in the imager software to open a menu in which the start and the end point of the video section (to be used for analysis) can be set. To do this, use the slider on the bottom of the screen to navigate through the video.\nTo select the current time point as the start or end point, click \"from frame #\" and \"to,\" respectively. Make sure the section contains at least 7 steps/paw (14 steps in total) of the animal running stably at a constant speed.\nEnter the animal identification, birth date, weight, and sex. Save the data on a desired location on the computer or server. Click \"camera\" to return to the recording interface.\nIf multiple running speeds need to be recorded, repeat steps 2.6 - 2.10 with the desired running speeds. Before recording the next video, ensure that the red paint is still present on the paw, otherwise repeat step 2.3.",
    "After recording, release the animal to its home cage. After removing an animal, clean the treadmill belt thoroughly with soapy water followed by disinfectant to prepare it for the next experimental animal.\n3. Video Processing\nStart the analysis software and click \"select study folder\" to select the folder with the recorded videos.\nSelect one video, or several videos that can be processed consecutively, and click \"go.\"\nUse the \"redraw\" function to select the area where the mouse is running; this section should only contain the mouse and white background.\nIf the \"reverse\" treadmill function was previously used, choose \"Check if subject's nose is to your right >>>\" to mirror the video since the software is designed to only analyze animals running to the left. Click \"accept\" to proceed.\nUse the \"refresh\" function to see the default mask and paw print that the software detects.\n\tNOTE: The original video is displayed on the left, and a black and white image of the proposed paw prints is on the right.\nEnter values in the \"length\" and \"width\" boxes to change the mask that excludes the red area around the snout of the animal for analysis; as the color is similar to the paws, not masking that area could result in the software accidentally classifying the snout area as a paw.\nAdjust the sliders \"filter noise\" and \"filter fur and dark patches\" to optimize the black and white paw print. Set the \"filter noise\" slider to ~800 - 950 for black animals and to ~700 - 800 for brown or white animals, depending on the exact fur color of the animal. Select \"ok\" when the settings are satisfactory.",
    "NOTE: The \"filter fur and dark patches\" slider depends on how \"red\" the paw is. For painted paws, the value is usually around 100 - 120, and for non-painted paws the best value is around 50 - 100. These settings depend on the color shadings of the fur and paws, and need to be optimized for every animal. The black and white paw print should have clear representations of the paws with as little background noise as possible.\nSelect one or several videos that passed the first adjustment (labeled with \"@@\" before the video name) and select the \"go\" function to start the analysis of these videos.\n\tNOTE: The analysis takes 2 - 5 min per video. It is possible to run the analysis of several videos overnight since this step requires no input from the experimenter.\nSelect an analyzed video (labeled with \"@@@\") and click \"go.\" Note that the paw area (in cm2) in contact with the belt over time (gait dynamics ) for each separate paw can now be seen. To compare the original video and the calculated paw print for a selected area, use the \"play video\" function.\nUse the following (three) tools to correct small mistakes made by the software.\n\t\nUse the \"correct\" option to delete a wrong signal, e.g., when the software records a signal even though the corresponding paw is not in contact with the belt. Click once to zoom into the relevant area, and mark the left border of the object to remove with the second click and the right border with the third click.",
    "Use the \"connect\" option to combine two signals, e.g., when no signal is recorded for a few frames even though the paw is in contact with the belt. Click once to zoom into the relevant area and double-click in the middle of the two objects to combine.\nUse the \"delete\" option to remove time points from the analysis completely. Use this option only if the mistake cannot be fixed with the \"correct\" or \"connect\" function, e.g., when a signal from the left forelimb paw is accidentally recorded for the left hind limb paw. Click once to zoom into the relevant area, and mark the left border of the area to remove with the second click and the right border with the third click.\n\t\tNOTE: The tools may only be used to correct small mistakes; systematic failures (e.g., if the signal from one paw was extremely weak) cannot be corrected: the video should be excluded from analysis and the recording of the respective animal repeated, when possible. Note that the \"play video\" option is no longer available after the \"correct,\" \"connect,\" or \"delete\" option has been used, and clicking the \"undo\" button will reset all 3 editing tools.\nSelect \"next limb\" to proceed through the 4 limbs; when \"next limb\" is clicked after the last paw, the software completes the analysis and shows the results for this animal on 4 screens.\n4. Gait Analysis\nWhen all videos from one experiment are analyzed, select all videos and click \"re-organize results\" to export the results (a list of parameters in spreadsheet files).",
    "Open the file with the ending \"reorganized_stride_info\" and add information that is not included in this spreadsheet: group information (e.g., genotype, treatment), age, and the measurements of animal length and width which are saved in another spreadsheet file with the ending \"SFI_TFI_PFI_reorganized_stride_info.\"\nNormalize the gait parameters to animal width or length where necessary, e.g., SL to animal length and SW to animal width.\nSort the results by group, age, and running speed: analyze all these conditions independently.\n\tNOTE: Different ages or running speeds cannot be combined within a same group.\nCalculate the average (mean) values, standard deviation, and standard error of the mean for each parameter for all experimental conditions.\nPerform statistical analysis according to the experimental design, e.g., use a 2-tailed t-test to compare mutant/treated animal to a wild-type (WT)/control, or ANOVA to compare several independent groups.\nLook at all measured parameters: it is helpful to plot each parameter to better visualize the results. If there are statistical differences in a given parameter, check if other dependent parameters change correspondingly.\n\tNOTE: For example, if the SL is significantly decreased in a certain test group, this will also cause a higher stride frequency (since the running speed is the same) and may result in an increased SW (in order to maintain posture stability).\nSelect parameters that are most relevant for a model, and/or are comparable to observations in the human disease. For a presentation, create representative videos for each group and complement them by graphs showing the readout for the relevant parameters, since subtle gait changes are often not obvious from the videos.\n5. Troubleshooting",
    "NOTE: Some animals, especially mouse models with an anxiety phenotype, may have difficulties to perform even a simple task like running on a treadmill. The following are steps that can be taken to lower anxiety levels and encourage running.\nHabituation and positive enforcement.\n\t\nAt 2 - 3 days before the first test, place the mouse in the test chamber, cover it with a dark cloth, and leave the light turned off. Let the mouse adjust to the new environment for ~5 min. Add chow or chocolate/nut butter (e.g., Nutella) to the test chamber so a positive association may be formed.\nNegative enforcement by air puffs/rear boundary.\n\t\nMice do not like air puffs or a movement behind them, and will run away from the disturbance. To motivate running, use mild air puffs, or rhythmic movement of the flexible bar that forms the rear boundary of the test chamber, to encourage the mouse to run towards the front part of the test chamber.\nSlow start.\n\t\nWhen testing fast running speeds, start the treadmill at a lower speed and then slowly increase the treadmill speed towards the desired testing condition.\nMinimize free movement.\n\t\nThe test chamber length is limited by two adjustable bars in the front and back. If a test animal keeps up with the running speed but does not run steadily, limit the chamber's length to result in more steady running.\nIf the above-mentioned measurements are not successful, record running on the next day. If the animal still refuses to run after testing on three days, record this as the finding, and exclude the animal from further testing.",
    "NOTE: The results of the gait analysis depend on good-quality video recording. There is no reason to exclude videos during the analysis if the videos have been recorded carefully. If the video quality is insufficient, it will become obvious during step 3.6 when the parameters for the creation of the digital paw print are being set. If any other body part except the paws and snout appears red (e.g., due to the missing fur around the genitals or finger paint sprinklings on the abdomen), the quality drops significantly. The adjustments in step 3.6 allow correcting only small issues, and if this cannot bring the video to an acceptable signal/noise ratio, the video needs to be excluded from the analysis, and recording needs to be repeated. Thus, it is recommended to analyze videos soon after recordings are performed.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
