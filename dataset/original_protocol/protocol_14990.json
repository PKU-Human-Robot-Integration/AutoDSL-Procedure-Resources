    "NOTE: Animal experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines and regulations imposed by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Procedures were conducted using sterile (autoclaved) surgical instruments and consumables. Whilst the murine model of renal IRI presented here was performed on an 8-week-old male Balb/c mouse it can be reproducibly performed on a variety of murine strains of either gender typically aged between 7 – 15 weeks, with the optimum age being 8 weeks. The data presented in the representative results section was obtained from both Balb/c and FVB mice. The application of warmed saline is used to keep the intestines and surgical area moist but it should be carefully monitored and kept to a minimum as the excessive application of fluids can lead to an artifactual lowering of the serum or plasma creatinine levels, which is an important experimental readout.\n1. Animal Preparation and Laparotomy\nAnesthetize the mouse with ketamine hydrochloride (70 mg/kg) and medetomidine hydrochloride (1 mg/kg) intraperitoneally and confirm the depth of anesthesia by loss of reflexes e.g. toe pinch. The duration of the resulting anesthetic plane is 4 hours. This is sufficient to perform the entire surgical procedure and no supplemental anesthesia is required.\nRemove the hair surrounding the incision area, ensure that the area is free of loose hair, and sanitize the abdominal skin using a dilute chlorhexidine solution.\nPlace the mouse on a heated surgical pad in a supine position and fix the upper and lower limbs to the pad using low-tack adhesive tape. Ensure that the upper extremities are maintained in a normal position to prevent lung compression. Throughout the procedure monitor the mouse for thermal burns. If possible it is recommended that a non-electric heat source be used.",
    "Administer the analgesic buprenorphine hydrochloride (0.06 mg/kg) subcutaneously and apply eye lubricant to the eyes to prevent corneal drying. Analgesics are administered pre-operatively in order to aid the post-surgical recovery.\nUsing tissue separating scissors or a scalpel blade make a midline laparotomy incision and bluntly separate the skin from the peritoneum. This allows the skin and peritoneum to be sutured separately during wound closure. An incision of the avascular linea alba is made giving access to the peritoneal cavity.\nTo create a clear view of the surgical area insert a retractor and drape the mouse.\n2. Ureter Division and Right Nephrectomy\nGently push the intestines towards the left side of the abdominal cavity using autoclaved sterilized cotton swabs moistened with saline to expose the right kidney and ureter. Cover the intestines with moistened drapes to prevent drying.\nLift the right ureter with angled forceps. Ligate the right ureter twice using 6/0 silk-braided suture. For long term experiments, use absorbable sutures for all abdominal surgeries.\nDivide the ureter between the sutures. Whilst the vesico-ureteric junction should prevent urine from leaking into the peritoneum from the bladder the ureter is ligated as a safeguard against any leakage post-operatively during long-term experiments.\nTo allow easier access when performing the right nephrectomy, gently push the liver up and to the right using a moistened cotton swab and hold in place using moistened gauze to expose the right renal artery and vein.\nBluntly dissect the connective tissue and fat along the medial aspect of the right kidney as far as the right renal artery and vein.",
    "Create a channel underneath the renal artery and vein by carefully sliding the angled forceps underneath the blood vessels. Guide the forceps underneath with the tips closed and gently remove with the tips open in order to facilitate the formation of the channel.\nRepeat step 2.6 until the tips of the forceps are visible through the connective tissues just above the renal artery and vein. Once visible gently rub the tips of the forceps against the tips of another set of angled forceps to gently break the connective tissue.\nWith the renal artery and vein clearly accessible they can now be occluded. Carefully slide angled forceps underneath the renal artery and vein with the tips closed. Once in place open the tips of the forceps and guide the haemostatic clip applicator between the tips and firmly apply a haemostatic clip onto the renal artery and vein close to the kidney. Alternatively the renal artery and vein can be ligated using 6/0 silk braided suture.\nDivide the occluded renal artery and vein close to the kidney, which can now be removed with any remaining adherent connective tissue.\nRemove any gauze used to hold the liver and replace the intestines with cotton swabs.\n3. Left Kidney Ischaemia and Reperfusion\nGently push the intestines towards the right side of the abdominal cavity with cotton swabs to expose the left kidney and ureter and cover with moistened drapes. If necessary the pancreas can be deflected with moistened gauze to allow easier access.\nUse blunt dissection to gently break the connective tissues anterior and posterior to the left renal artery and vein, and then create a channel underneath the vessels in a similar manner to that described in Ureter Division and Right Nephrectomy step 2.4.",
    "Induce ischaemia of the left kidney by applying a micro serrafine clip onto the renal artery and vein. Successful ischaemia can be visually confirmed by a gradual uniform darkening of the kidney. Blood vessels in addition to the left renal artery and vein may occasionally supply the kidney. If present, these additional blood vessels will also need to be occluded using micro serrafine clips in order to successfully induce ischaemia of the entire kidney.\nReplace the intestines and carefully ensure that there are no abrupt twists that may lead to intestinal ischaemia compromising results. Temporarily close the peritoneum with a single suture.\nFollowing ischaemia induction immediately place the mouse on a homeothermic blanket with a rectal thermistor attached to a control unit that will maintain the body temperature at 37 °C for the required duration of ischaemia. To define the appropriate length of ischaemia necessary to induce the desired degree of renal injury and kidney failure it is recommended that a titration be performed for each strain and surgical operator.\nShortly before the end of the ischaemic period re-open the peritoneum and carefully position the intestines to allow access to the clamp and view the kidney. Insertion of the retractor, as shown in the video, is not necessary and was solely performed for presentational purposes.\nRemove the clamp after the period of ischaemia has concluded. Immediately after removal the kidney will rapidly change color from a dark maroon to a healthy dark pink indicating successful reperfusion.\nAgain ensure that the intestines are not twisted prior to closing the peritoneum with a blanket stitch using 6/0 braided silk suture. Then close the skin using metallic skin clips.\nTo minimize the risk of post-operative infection, apply an antiseptic such as iodine/alcohol solution to the surgical area.\n4. Post-operative Recovery and Care",
    "Partially reverse anesthesia with atipamezole hydrochloride (2 mg/kg) subcutaneously and administer fluids with a subcutaneous injection of 1 ml warmed saline to prevent dehydration following surgery.\nCarefully monitor mice until they have recovered consciousness, appear alert and are able to right themselves.\nAllow mice to recover in a heated box kept at 29 °C, located in a quiet environment, for 24 hr. Mice will have an impaired ability to thermoregulate due to the anesthesia and it is therefore crucial that they are housed at an elevated temperature to enable effective recovery. Moistened food can also be provided to encourage fluid and nutrition intake.\nFor long-term recovery experiments provide ongoing analgesics and remove skin clips 7 days following surgery.\n5. Assessing Functional and Structural Kidney Injury and Regeneration\nBlood may be collected from the tail vein during experiments or by cardiac puncture at the time of euthanasia at the end of the experiment. Measure renal function by serum creatinine, using a creatinase based method, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) on a biochemical centrifugal analyzer as described previously7. The renal function of normal healthy mice needs to be determined before establishing a model of renal failure as this can vary markedly depending on the analysis method used e.g. the Jaffe reaction and creatinase based methods for measuring creatinine give different results.\nExamine renal structure by histopathology on paraffin embedded kidney tissue sections stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) or Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS). Capture between 5 – 10 images at 200x magnification within the outer stripe of the outer medulla (OSOM) for each mouse. Assess the level of injury in the OSOM as this region is injured in this model because it is highly vulnerable to hypoxia.",
    "Use either of the two scoring systems detailed below to measure acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or regeneration. Representative morphology of the classifications used in these systems is illustrated in Figure 1.\nUse a simple binary system to score ATN. On the basis of cellular integrity and morphology mark and count tubules as either viable (intact cell morphology) or necrotic (compromised cell integrity, abnormal cell morphology or loss of cells).\n\t\nExpress the number of necrotic tubules as a percentage of the total number of tubules (necrotic tubules %).\nClassify regeneration using another system based on cell integrity, morphology and nuclei number. Mark and count tubules as healthy, necrotic, injured or recovering according to the criteria listed in the following steps.\n\t\nAs with the ATN scoring system (detailed in step 5.4) mark tubules with intact normal cells as healthy whilst tubules showing compromised cell integrity, abnormal cell morphology or overt cell loss should be scored as necrotic.\nClassify tubules as injured if they have a thinned cytoplasm containing few nuclei. In contrast, designate tubules containing more nuclei with more normal cell morphology as recovering.\nExpress each tubule classification as a percentage of the total tubule number.\nSubscription Required.
