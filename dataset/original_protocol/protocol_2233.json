    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSurgical procedure for aspiration lesions in Japanese quail\nTiming: 1 h per subject\nThis step describes how to create craniotomies and aspiration lesions in Japanese quail, as well as manage pre-surgical and post-surgical care.\nNote: Sham lesions can be created by following all step outlined below with the exclusion of aspirations outlined in step 11.\nBefore starting surgery, determine target coordinates for aspiration lesion. Using the atlas described by Baylé and colleagues (1974), Hp lesions should include the area spanning 5 mm anterior to bregma, 3 mm posterior, 1.5 mm on either side of interfrontal suture, and 3 mm in depth. APH lesions are 5 mm anterior to bregma, 3 mm posterior, 1.5 mm–3.5 mm lateral to bregma, 2 mm deep.\nCritical: It is essential for surgery to be carried out in a sterile environment. Surgical instruments must be autoclaved prior to surgery day and sterilized between subjects (if more than one surgery is occurring per surgery day). Decontamination with 75% alcohol may be used in addition to bead sterilization.\nNote: Quail are not fasted prior to surgery here. However, 1 h of fasting prior to avian surgery is common as it is thought that an empty crop and stomach can reduce the risk of regurgitation and subsequent aspiration on gastric contents (Curro, 1998[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; but see Jenkins, 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nNote: Coordinates given are for Japanese quail and were determined using the atlas described by Baylé and colleagues (1974). This protocol can readily be adapted for use with other birds by utilizing an atlas appropriate for the desired species.\nPrepare subject for surgery.\nWeigh quail and administer analgesic (5 mg/kg) and antibiotic (5 mg/kg) subcutaneously. Record quail weight, the rate and concentration of drug, and dose administered into surgical log (see Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1840-Mmc1.pdf] for example).",
    "Note: Calculate the volume of drug to administer by multiplying the weight of the subject (kg) by the rate of the drug (mg/kg) and then dividing by the drug concentration (mL/mg).\nNote: A relatively straightforward injection location can be found under the wing against the body of the subject. Here you should find an area with fewer feathers where the skin will be visible.\nSedate quail using gradual fill isoflurane in induction chamber 5% for induction delivered in 500 mL/min oxygen.\nNote: While not necessary, covering the induction chamber with a shroud can be helpful in minimizing stress to the subject.\nWhen righting reflex has ceased, move subject to stereotax, prone position, secure ear bars, secure beak into nosecone.\nCritical: Use a heating pad to maintain body temperature during surgery, aiming for 35°C–40°C. Be sure that this temperature is not exceeded as overheating can lead to mortalities.\nCritical: Ear bar insertion should be done with extreme caution. If they are too loose, the head will not be secure during the procedure. Too tight, and there is a risk of rupturing the subject’s eardrum. Ensure ear bars are inserted evenly on both sides. The average ear bar insertion for Japanese quail in the procedure described here was 1.2cm.\nCritical: After securing ear bars and nosecone, ensure that the head is unable to move and will remain stationary during the following steps. Skull movement during craniotomy and aspiration will cause inaccuracies when locating the target.\nNote: An internal probe may be used to monitor body temperature, however, setting your heating device to an output within the range described is also sufficient.",
    "Note: Several methods are available for securing the beak within a nosecone. One method is to use a rat nose cone. For quail, secure the head by closing the beak, placing the bite bar under the beak, and gently adjusting the nose cone so that the top of the bill is secured against the internal rubber lining of the nose cone. This method was utilized in the study by Damphousse et al. (2022)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] and provided consistent lesion placement. An alternative method, placing the bite bar into the gaping beak is outlined in Prather (2012)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7].\nContinue nosecone anesthesia with isoflurane, 5% for induction, 2%–3% for maintenance delivered in 225 mL/min oxygen.\nCritical: Monitor anesthesia levels closely throughout the procedure. If the subject is moving or their eyes are open, increase the concentration of isoflurane. In this scenario, adjust isoflurane and restrain the animal to avoid injury until appropriate level of sedation returns. If the subject’s breathing rate has decreased dramatically and their feet appear more blue than red (indicative of blood flow), reduce isoflurane immediately.\nPluck feathers from surgery area using forceps.\nInject lidocaine subcutaneously at surgical site (1 mL of 2% solution).\nAdminister ophthalmic ointment in both eyes of the animal to protect the corneas from drying and abrasion.\nCritical: Ophthalmic ointment should be reapplied throughout surgery.\nCover the body of the subject with surgical shroud so that only the head and surgical site are uncovered.\nNote: Clear plastic sealing wrap (like Glad® Press’n Seal) can be used for this step as it allows for easy monitoring of foot color and respiration, and aids in minimizing heat loss.\nPrepare the surgical area using antibacterial cleanser, isopropyl alcohol, and chlorhexidine gluconate solution. Repeat this step twice.",
    "Critical: Before proceeding with incision, firmly pinch toe to ensure no reflex. If withdrawal reflex is present, wait or increase isoflurane flow.\nMake an incision over midline of scalp to expose skull. Secure skin using hemostats.\nPrepare for craniotomy.\nClear the exposed skull of fluid using cotton swabs.\nLocate bregma and interfrontal suture (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nNote: The interfrontal suture may be difficult to locate. In Japanese quail, there is a portion of the skull over each hemisphere where the skull is very thin and the underlying tissue is visible. If the interfrontal suture is not visible, measuring the distance between these two locations as an approximation of the interfrontal suture has proven to yield symmetrical lesions.\nRefer to coordinates for desired lesion and mark these locations on the skull (distance from the interfrontal suture, distance of most rostral and most caudal locations from Bregma). This should result in a rectangular window out of which to drill the craniotomy.\nNote: Marking can be done by gently scoring the skull surface using a small rotary tool bit or by using a sterilized unlacquered pencil (Terzic et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nNote: The following is important to consider for bilateral lesions as described in the study by Damphousse and colleague (2022). Hp will only require one craniotomy since this structure is located at the midline. The Hp of both hemispheres can be accessed this way. APH will require two identical craniotomies, one over each hemisphere.\nDrill the craniotomy using the rotary tool.",
    "Critical: To ensure the bit does not advance through the skull and into the underlying tissue, great care needs to be taken. When drilling the craniotomy, elbows of the operator should be planted firmly on the surgical table and the tool should be held with both hands. Rather than drilling one side to completion before moving on to the next, the entire perimeter of the craniotomy should be drilled gradually. This involves continually tracing the parameter with the rotary tool in one motion until the desired portion of skull is loose and can be removed in one piece. Removing the skull in this way minimizes risk of damaging underlying tissue with shards of skull.\nRemove portion of skull that has been cut away using forceps and ensure craniotomy is free of bone fragments, this can be done with forceps and/or by clearing with a wash of sterile saline.\nPrepare the tissue for aspiration. Using a pipette and pipette bulb, aspirate the area to predetermined depth.\nUsing a permanent marker, mark the desired lesion depth from the tip of the Pasteur pipette (3 mm for Hp, 2 mm for APH). Sterilize pipette in bead sterilizer.\nNote: While aspirations in the study by Damphousse and colleagues (2022) were done free-hand, if a stereotaxic arm is available, the pipette may be secured to this to ensure lesion placement.\nRemove dura from the surface of the brain using a needle. This can be accomplished by very gently passing the needle tip over the tissue, snagging the dura so it can be cleared.\nNote: Using a needle driver or tweezers to slightly bend the tip of the needle into a hook can be a helpful tool in clearing dura.",
    "Secure the bulb to the pipette and begin aspiration. Since this step is done by hand, elbows should be planted firmly on the work surface to provide stability. Suction is created by releasing air from the bulb and then pinching the appropriate valve to allow suction through the pipette tip. Aspirate the tissue within the craniotomy while reaching the desired depth marked on the pipette.\nNote: At this step, there may be increased bleeding within the craniotomy. Control bleeding by applying sterilized cotton swabs or hemostatic sponge. Ensure bleeding has stopped before proceeding to the following step.\nInsert hemostatic sponge into craniotomy, fitting snugly and covering exposed brain.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1840-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Placement of lesions\nThe left image is a schematic of the Hp lesion and the right, of bilateral APH lesions. The red dot signifies Bregma and the displayed scale is zeroed at this location.\nPrepare to apply bone wax to seal craniotomy.\nUsing a scalpel, lightly score the skull around the craniotomy.\nThoroughly dry the scored skull using cotton swabs and clear of any debris.\nNote: Light scoring helps for better adhesion of the bone wax. If the surface of the skull under the wax is not dry, the bone wax will not adhere.\nHeat steel spatula in bead sterilizer or with flame if sterilizer is not available.\nUse hot spatula to melt wax over the craniotomy, smoothing the wax and ensuring even distribution over the craniotomy and covering the scored skull.\nAllow 2–3 min for the wax to resolidify.\nClose the incision using an interrupted suture pattern.\nRemove the ear bars, turn isoflurane flow down to 0% and allow the subject to begin to recover.\nCritical: Continue heat support as subject is recovering from anesthesia.",
    "Once the subject has begun to show movement, swaddle in a clean towel, making sure the wings are secured tightly to the body, and hold until subject is alert and responsive.\nCritical: During this stage of recovery, quail will often become alarmed and will try to flap their wings while attempting to escape. The subject can cause serious harm to themselves if this occurs so preventative swaddling is necessary.\nOnce the subject’s eyes are open and they can remain upright without assistance, place into recovery cage with heat support and continue to monitor until animal is alert and mobile.\nNote: Recovery cage can be covered with a shroud to minimize stress to the animal.\nRecord surgical notes into log (ex. Type of lesion, problems during surgery, number of sutures, etc.).\nOnce recovered, place the subject into individual caging in housing room where they will undergo daily monitoring.\nPost-surgical care\nTiming: 7 days\nThe following steps are critical for pain management, condition monitoring, and reducing risk of infection following surgery.\nCreate a log to properly monitor treatment and condition of subjects (see Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1840-Mmc1.pdf] for template). This document should include pre-surgical information (as described in the previous section) and post-surgical information described below.\nDaily monitoring.\nWeigh quail and record in log (see Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1840-Mmc1.pdf]).\nNote: If weight decreases below a level determined by your veterinarian (usually 70% of the quail’s pre-operative weight), notify the institutional animal care staff and seek potential consultation with your veterinarian (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nDetermine the volume of drug to be administered based on daily weight.\nCritical: Treat quail post-surgically with analgesics (e.g., ketoprofen) for 72 h, followed by antibiotic drugs (e.g., enrofloxacin) subcutaneously for up to 1 week.\nRecord the condition of each subject.",
    "Note: Condition can be scored by asking a variety of questions. For example, is the quail bright, alert, and responsive? Does the quail orient toward the door of their cage when the experimenter is present? If no, contact animal care staff as this could indicate that the subject is in pain or needs medical intervention. Record all observations in the post-surgical log.\nCritical: Consultation with your institutional veterinarian must be done to establish species specific behaviors associated with pain as well as humane endpoints. Japanese quail specifically should be monitored for anorexia, feather pulling, immobility or problems with stability, and a lack of responsiveness. Again, it is vital to log all observations.\nNote: If the experimenter is planning on proceeding to the FA procedure, during the 1-week post-surgical care period, supplemental feeding with 3–4 mealworms daily is essential to familiarize quail with the novel food.\nBehavioral experiments\nThe behavioral tests described in the following section are not mandatory but were used in Damphousse et al. (2022)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] as one way of assessing the effects of Hp and APH lesions on spatial memory and object recognition memory. If the behavioral protocols are not desired, skip to step 32 for histology protocol to assess lesion placement. Note that training may also take place prior to lesions for some behavioral tasks (particularly tasks that take many trials to train).\nForaging array\nTiming: 14 days\nThe following steps can be used as one way to assess Japanese quail spatial memory.\nForging arena. To construct the foraging arena using standard components, we recommend using white corrugated plastic sheeting arranged into an octagon (each wall 50 cm in length, 45 cm in height). The flooring should also be constructed of the same sheeting (120 cm × 120 cm).",
    "Construct 8 unique visual cues from black poster board (ex. heart, star, circle, etc.). Four cues should be secured to walls within the maze and the other four attached to the walls of the room near the ceiling, making sure they are visible to the subject from inside the arena.\nConstruct 8 food cups using a 3.25 oz plastic cup (height: 3.17 cm, bottom diameter: 5.4 cm, top diameter: 7.3 cm), with a 2 oz cup (height: 3 cm, bottom diameter: 4.13 cm, top diameter: 6.9 cm) with a perforated bottom nested within it (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). In the outer cup, place dried mealworms (to control for scent cues) and firmly secure the smaller cup inside. Surround inner and outer cups with tape so that worms are not visible. Attach to a piece of white corrugated plastic sheeting (8.25 cm square) to improve stability. Food cups are placed in the arena in the configuration depicted in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] and secured using double sided tape.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1840-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Cups used in FA\n(A and B) Depicted are (A) a sideview of the cup, as well as (B) a top view of cup with inner perforated cup removed, revealing mealworms.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1840-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Foraging array layout\nPlacement of cups are pictured using circles. The ‘x’ marks an example location for the baited cup (adapted from Damphousse et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\n1 h prior to each step described below, remove food and transport subjects to testing room in a rack containing all subjects in individual cages. Surround cages with a curtain and leave subjects undisturbed.\nNote: Between subjects, wipe down the arena using 70% ethanol to eliminate scent trails.\nHabituation. There are 5 total days of habituation.\nOn Days 1 and 2, habituate the quail to transport. On these days, only conduct step 24.",
    "On Days 3–5, habituate the quail to the arena. Place the subject into the center of the arena with all cups baited with one mealworm. Film behavior using an overhead webcam and record the number of mealworms eaten. Remove the subject once all worms have been consumed or after 600 s has elapsed.\nTraining trials. There are 8 total days of training with 3 training trials per subject per day. During training, only one cup is baited, and this remains consistent throughout all training trials.\nPlace the subject into the arena at 1 of 3 locations (N, S, E) chosen at random for each trial.\nRecord the session using overhead camera.\nStop the trials either after the subject retrieves worms from the baited cup or after 300 s have elapsed. Record the latency to reach the baited cup.\nReturn the subject to the holding cage for 1 h.\nRepeat a-d until all 3 trials are complete. Remember to start from 1 of the 3 start locations without repeating positions on a given testing day.\nProbe trial. This phase is 1 trial, occurring over 1 day. During this trial, no cups are baited.\nPlace the subject into the arena from novel direction (W) for 2 min.\nRecord the session using an overhead camera. Record the latency to reach the target cup.\nSpontaneous object recognition\nTiming: 4 days\nThe following step can be used to assess object recognition memory in Japanese quail.\nTesting arena. To construct the testing arena using standard components, we recommend using white corrugated plastic sheeting arranged into a square (each wall 90 cm in length, 45 cm in height). The flooring should also be constructed of the same sheeting (90 cm × 90 cm) and covered in wood shavings.",
    "Cover the inside of one of the walls in black Bristol board.\nSelect 2 different kinds of junk objects. Three copies of each object will need to be obtained so that the same object is never used twice for one bird. A variety of stimulus objects can be used. However, attempt, if possible, to satisfy the following criteria (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] for example objects):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1840-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Objects used for SOR\nExamples of ‘junk’ objects used during SOR (from Damphousse et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3], used with the permission of the authors)\nObjects must be constructed from washable materials including plastic, glass, and aluminum.\nObjects must be devoid of biologically relevant features such as eyes and mouths, and likenesses to food or nesting materials.\nObjects should range from 10 to 20 cm in height and vary in visual and tactile characteristics.\n1 h prior to all phases described below, remove food and transport the subjects to the testing room in a rack containing all subjects in individual cages. Surround the cages with a curtain and leave the subjects undisturbed.\nHabituation. There are 3 consecutive days of habituation to the empty arena.\nPlace each quail in turn into the arena and allow each to explore freely for 10 min.\nRepeat step ‘a’ once a day for a total of 3 days.\nRecognition Testing. Both sample and choice phases occur on the same day with a 1-min inter-trial interval (ITI; Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1840-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. SOR Arena layout and trial timing",
    "Schematic demonstrating the placement of objects and timing of trials. The left box is an example of arena layout (with two identical objects) during the sample phase and the right depicts the choice phase in which one object identical to the sample objects is used alongside a novel object. The dashed gray circle depicted in the sample phase is to illustrate the area in which the entire body of the quail must be present for “exploration” to be occurring. This dashed circle is not physically present within the area and is instead being used for visualization of the region of interest (adapted from Damphousse et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nSample Phase. Two identical objects are placed within the arena. Place the subject into the arena to explore freely for 5 min.\nRecord behavior using an overhead camera.\nMove the subject from the arena to a holding cage for 1 min. During this time, redistribute shavings within the arena to control for scent cues.\nChoice Phase. Place 2 objects that the subject has yet to see within the arena. One of these objects should identical to those used during sample (familiar), while the other is novel. Place the subject into the arena to explore freely for 5 min.\nRecord behavior using an overhead camera.\nReturn the subject to their individual cage.\nHistology\nTiming: ∼3 days\nThe following step can be used to assess the extent of tissue damage caused by the Hp and APH aspiration lesions.\nTransport subjects to a procedure room and anesthetize using isoflurane (5% isoflurane delivered in 500 mL/min oxygen).\nDecapitate subject and extract brain, immediately flash freezing in a container of 2-methylbutane that has been cooling within in a dry-ice and alcohol slurry.",
    "Remove brain from slurry using forceps, wrap in aluminum foil, place in airtight container (like a 50 mL centrifuge tube) and put container in a cooler of dry-ice.\nOnce all tissue is collected, airtight containers should be placed within a resealable bag and stored at −80°C until sectioning.\nCritical: Removing the brain and working with the frozen tissue should be done quickly. If too much time elapses between brain extraction and freezing, the tissue may lose rigidity and the lesion may later appear distorted. Additionally, wrapping the tissue in foil and subsequent transport to a −80°C freezer should be done quickly to avoid thawing.\nPause point: When stored as described, the tissue remains viable indefinitely.\nSectioning. Embed tissue in mounting medium and cut sections at 30 μm thickness with a cryostat.\nThaw-mount onto Superfrost Plus™ slides, air-dry slides, place in slide box wrapped in plastic wrap, place inside airtight bag and store at −80°C.\nCollect every 6th section and stain using Nuclear fast red-aluminum sulfate.\nView and record the placement and extent of the lesions using a brightfield microscope."
