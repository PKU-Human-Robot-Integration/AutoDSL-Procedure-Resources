    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of virus stock\nTiming: [4 days]\nThis step enables the propagation of a defined reference virus strain in a standard cell line, Vero E6. Infectivity of the resultant virus stock will then be determined in the subsequent section (beginning at step 19).\nFor each 15 mL of virus stock to be produced prepare one 90% confluent 75 cm2 flask of Vero E6 cells. Prepare one additional flask per experiment for the mock control.\nNote: Properties of cell lines can change during prolonged passaging. Prepare stocks of early passages of your cell line and store in liquid nitrogen. Regularly (∼20 passages, or if changes to morphology of the cell line or infectability are observed) restart your cell culture with an early passage vial.\nCalculate the required volume of virus stock (inoculum) for a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 PFU per cell.\nA 75 cm2 flask of Vero E6 cells will contain approximately 107 cells.\nThe aim is to inoculate at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI, i.e., <0.01 PFU per cell) to avoid the build-up of defective-interfering particles during sequential subculture. A lower MOI than 0.01 can be used as determined by the user of this protocol.\nCalculate the required volume of D2 medium (3 mL minus inoculum per 75 cm2 flask) and add this to a 5 mL reagent tube.\nAdd the inoculum to the reagent tube from step 3.\nRemove the supernatant from the flasks.\nAdd the diluted inoculum to all flasks to be inoculated.\nAdd 3 mL of D3 medium to the mock control flask.\nIncubate 30 min inside the microbiolocial safety cabinet to allow the virus to attach. Redistribute the supernatant repeatedly to prevent the cells from drying out.",
    "Remove the supernatant and dispose as infectious waste according to local regulations.\nRinse all flasks twice with 10 mL D2.\nAdd 15 mL D2 to each flask.\nIncubate at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nStarting from 2 days post infection (p.i.) observe the cell monolayers for signs of cytopathic effect (CPE) twice a day (morning and afternoon) using the inverted phase contrast microscope. The mock control flask serves as a comparison for an uninfected cell layer (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1168-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Phase contrast images showing a representative example of cytophatic effect (full CPE) in Vero E6 cells compared to control (mock)\nScale bar 50 μm.\nCritical: No CPE should be visible in the mock control flask. CPE in the control flask indicates poor sterile technique. This is particularly important if different strains or isolates are grown at the same time.\nCritical: Harvesting before obvious cytopathic effects risks a very low titer. Harvesting long after peak production risks losing infectivity due to thermal instability of the virus.\nOnce fulminant CPE is observed, transfer the supernatant into a centrifuge tube.\nDispose of the flasks and remaining cells in accordance with local safety regulations.\nTransfer the supernatant of the mock control flask into another centrifuge tube.\nDispose of the flasks and remaining cells in accordance with local safety regulations.\nPellet the cell debris by centrifugation at 500 g for 10 min at 4°C.\nTransfer 200–1000 μL aliquots of the supernatant into screw cap tubes.\nTransfer a 500 μL aliquot of the mock control supernatant into a screw cap tube.\nThe rest of the mock control supernatant can be discarded.\nStore the aliquots at −80°C.",
    "Note: The infectivity of the stock decreases with freeze thawing. For maximum accuracy, store the aliquots overnight (16 h) or longer at −80°C before continuing with the next step. Adjust the volume of the aliquots to avoid subsequent freeze thaw cycles. 200 and 500 μl aliquots are good starting points.\nDetermining the infectious particles by plaque assay\nTiming: [4 days]\nThis step is used to quantify infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles per mL of virus stock. A 10-fold serial dilution of the original stock is added to confluent cell monolayers and overlaid with a viscous medium to restrict diffusion of progeny virions. This prevents convective spread of the virus, so each infectious particle generates a single plaque. Counting of the plaques at different dilutions can be used to estimate the number of infectious particles in the original sample.\nPlate 5×105 Vero E6 cells in 2 mL complete growth medium per well of a six-well plate. Incubate overnight (16 h) at 37°C with 5% CO2. Prepare 1 plate per virus stock to be quantified and one plate for the mock control supernatant.\nAlternatively, plate 1.5×105 Vero E6 cells in 2 mL growth medium per well of a six-well plate. Incubate 3 d at 37°C with 5% CO2. This allows setting up the plates on Friday and continuing with the inoculation step on Monday.\nConfirm that the cells have formed a confluent monolayer by observing them under the microscope.\nVirus dilutions can be made in 1.5 mL reaction tubes or alternatively, in 96-well deep block plates (2.2 mls).\nFor 1.5 mL reaction tubes:\nTake the 6 1.5 mL reaction tubes for the dilution series required and label with dilution (this may be between 10−1 and 10−6 for each isolate) and isolate name.",
    "Add 900 μL D2 to each tube/well. Prepare six tubes per virus stock to be titrated.\nTransfer 100 μL virus to the first tube/well. Discard tip.\nMix the first virus dilution by pipetting up and down several times.\nTransfer 100 μL of this diluted virus into the second tube/well. Discard tip.\nContinue tenfold dilution series to 106 dilution.\nRepeat step 22 for every virus stock and for the mock control supernatant.\nAspirate the medium from each well of one 6-well plate.\nQuickly transfer 0.5 mL of each dilution of each virus into a well. Start with the highest dilution (10−6) of virus working up to the lowest dilution. It is not necessary to change tips between dilutions.\nIncubate at room temperature for 40 min, gently tilting the plates every 5 min to prevent the cell layer from drying out.\nAdd 2 mL overlay medium to each well. There is no need to remove the supernatant.\nMix overlay and inoculum by gently swirling the plate.\nIncubate undisturbed at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 3 days. Troubleshooting 1\nVisible plaques are usually observed after 3 days but this can be reduced to 2 days or increased to 4 days depending on the virus strain.\nRemove the supernatant by aspiration and dispose as contaminated waste.\nAdd 5 mL fixative per well and incubate for a minimum of 1 h at room temperature inside the microbiological safety cabinet.\nNote: Adjust this step to conform with local rules for inactivation of the virus and decontamination of the plate.\nRemove the fixative and add 2 mL of PBS per well.\nRemove the PBS and add a minimum of 1 mL staining solution to each well. Incubate for ∼4 h or until sufficient staining of the remaining cell monolayer is observed.\nRemove the staining solution.",
    "Gently wash away the remaining staining solution with water.\nTake care not to apply water with force as this can damage the cell monolayer.\nInvert the plates and allow the cell monolayer to airdry.\nOptional: Image the plate wells.\nCount wells that contain approximately 10–50 plaques. Check that the 10-fold dilutions agree to approximately 2-fold.\nCalculate the plaque forming units (PFU) per mL of virus stock as follows: Multiply the obtained number of plaques by the dilution and correct for volume of virus added (e.g., if you obtained 43 plaques in the well to which you added 500 μL of the 10−5 dilution, the titer of the original stock is 43 × 105 × 2 = 8.6 × 106 PFU ml−1). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]\nIsolation of human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from bone marrow, umbilical cord or peripheral blood\nTiming: approximately 8 h\nMake sure to have a separate, new disposal bag for anything that comes into contact with the blood so it can be discarded immediately after finishing.\nTurn on the hood and spray down with 70% ethanol, along with pipet-aides, tissue culture flasks (T175s), pipettes, etc.\nEstimate the total volume of fresh blood or bone marrow (BM) aspirate that you have. When using human bone marrow purchased from StemCell Technologies (Cat#70001), you will begin the protocol at this point by defrosting the sample in pure FBS and centrifuge at 300 g for 5 min at 20°C and continue with step 52.\nYou will need to dilute the blood or BM 2:1 with PBS (e.g., if you have 150 mL of blood in total, you will need to add 300 mL of PBS).\nNote: Diluting the blood 3× (e.g., 150 ml of blood with 450 ml of PBS) can give a cleaner layer of mononuclear cells after centrifugation.",
    "Pour the blood or BM into a large tissue culture flask and mix with an appropriate volume of PBS.\nPrepare 15 mL of Ficoll into 50 mL falcon tubes (prepare enough tubes considering you are going to add 30 mL of PBS-diluted blood in each tube).\nMaking sure the blood and PBS are mixed, layer 30 mL of blood very gently so as to not mix it with the Ficoll.\nNote: If there is an option, select the lowest flow setting on the pipette and angle the tube as horizontal as possible without spilling the Ficoll and blood within. Both of these will minimise the risk of the blood mixing in with the Ficoll (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nSpin down at 450 g for 30 min and at 20°C–25°C, making sure there is no brake on.\nCritical: Having any type of brake on the centrifuge will disturb the layer of mononuclear cells.\nCritical: It is imperative that the centrifuge be at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for the Ficoll to retain its correct desity.\nNote: After the spin, there should be 4 distinct layers: a bottom layer of dark red blood cells with the Ficoll above, a top layer of serum, and a thin layer in the middle (between the serum and Ficoll) of mononuclear cells. You want to collect the mononuclear cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1168-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Mononuclear cell isolation using Ficoll gradient\nTry to pipette 30 mL of blood very gently and angle the tube as horizontal as possible to not mix it with the Ficoll (A). After the centrifugation you should see 4 layers (B).",
    "Take the mononuclear cell layer using a pipette and transfer it to a new 50 mL falcon tube. For this, you can pool the mononuclear cell layers from several falcons from the first spin until you have 20–25 mL in total in the new falcon tubes.\nDilute 1:1 with PBS+2% FBS (i.e., add 20–25 mL of PBS + 2% FBS to 20–25 mL of mononuclear cell solution) and centrifuge at 300 g for 5 min at 20°C.\nRemove the supernatant from all of the falcon tubes.\nTo lyse the red blood cells resuspend one cell pellet with 20 mL ammonium chloride. Transfer this resuspended cell pellet to the next falcon and use it to resuspend the next pellet. Repeat the process in order to resuspend up to 5 cell pellets in 20 mL ammonium chloride. Leave at 20°C–25°C for 5 min. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]\nAdd 2 mL of pure FBS (heat inactivated) to buffer the lysis and centrifuge at 300 g for 5 min at 20°C.\nNote: When using human bone marrow purchased from StemCell Technologies (Cat#70001), you will begin the protocol at this point by defrosting the sample in pure FBS, then centrifuge at 300 g for 5 min at 20°C and continue with step 52.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 5 mL 2% FBS/PBS.\nCount the cells and continue with the HSPC purification.\nPause point: At this point, you can freeze the cells in FBS with 10% DMSO (Mitrus et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) and continue another day. Just be aware that a cycle of freeze/thaw will reduce your yield of isolated cells considerably. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]\nUse the EasySep Human Progenitor Cell Enrichment kit (StemCell Technologies, Cat#19356)",
    "Prepare your mononuclear cell suspension at 5 × 107 cells per mL in 5 mL polystyrene tubes in a maximum volume of 2 mL.\nAdd 50 ul/mL of Enrichment Cocktail to the sample and incubate at 20°C–25°C for 15 min.\nAdd 100 ul of Magnetic particles per mL of sample and incubate at 20°C–25°C for 5 min.\nTop up to 2.5 mL with 2% FBS/PBS and place the tube into the magnet and incubate at 20°C–25°C for 10 min. The magnet draws out the magnetic beads which are attached to the lineage cells to be discarded.\nCarefully transfer the non-magnetic cell suspension with the pipette into a new 5 mL polystyrene tube and centrifuge at 300 g for 5 min at 20°C.\nStain the enriched cell suspension with the antibody cocktail listed in key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] to define and sort for hematopoietic stem cells and erythroid progenitors. This should be carried out using the following steps:\nPrepare the antibody cocktail in the following way (antibody dilutions together with the identifier codes can also be found in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]), mixing the cocktail thoroughly via pipetting:\nAs indicated above, each sample should be stained in a solution made up of the flow buffer (2% FBS in PBS) and the antibodies. We recommend making a master mix for all of your samples. In order to do this, multiply the volumes of each reagent in the table above by N+1, where N is the number of samples you have to ensure you have enough staining volume for the last sample. E.g. if you have 10 samples, multiply the staining volume by 11 to produce the master mix for the antibody cocktail.",
    "Note: We recommend titrating the staining volumes of each antibody prior the execuation of the experiment as the optimal titers may vary according to the number of cells that are to be stained and the level of expression of each marker/antigen within those cells. As with the master mix, the reagent volumes should be multiplied up according to the total volume used per sample (e.g. multiply all of the reagent volumes in the table above by a factor of 3 if it is determined that 300 uL of staining volume is needed per sample).\nCritical: You must ensure that the antibody vials are opened and handled without direct exposure to light (e.g. switch off the light of the fume hood you are working in), to avoid photobleaching of the conjugated antibodies.\nCentrifuge the polystyrene tubes with the non-magnetic cell suspension (from step 54e) for 5 min at 300 g and 20°C.\nRemove the supernatant from the sample tubes and add the necessary volume of the antibody cocktail per sample.\nResuspend the pellet of cells in each tube in the antibody cocktail via pipetting.\nIncubate at 4°C for 30–60 min, covering with aluminum foil if necessary to protect from light.\nAfter the incubation period finishes, wash the samples by adding the flow buffer (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for details) at a volume which is at least 10-fold the staining volume e.g., at least 1 mL flow buffer for 100 uL staining volume.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1168_10.csv\nCentrifuge the samples for 5 min at 300 g and 20°C.\nPrepare the solution to be used for staining of the viability marker. For this, dilute DAPI (BD Biosciences, Cat#56407) 1:1000 in the flow buffer.",
    "Note: As with the staining volume, the volume of the DAPI solution to be used per sample should be titrated according to the number of cells present and to ensure an appropriate concentration of cells in the solution for the purposes of an efficient sorting process.\nRemove the supernatant from the sample tubes and resuspend the pellets in the DAPI solution via pipetting.\nFilter the samples in order to remove any clumps in the cell suspension that may block the sorter.\nPrepare 4 × 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes for Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) collection of each sample by adding 200 μL of pure FBS into each tube. Up to 4 populations can be sorted simultaneously, as available instrumentation allows (e.g., HSCs, ERP-S1, ERP-S2 and ERP-S3 as in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1168-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Representative gating strategy to define hematopoietic stem cells and erythroid progenitors\nNote: PBS+2% FBS can be used as collection media but you achieve better recovery of cells with pure FBS.\nCentrifuge the sorted cell populations at 300 g for 5 min at 20°C and resuspend in StemSpan SFEM (Stem Cell Technologies) supplemented with 100 ng/mL rhFLT-3L, 100 ng/mL rhSCF and 100 ng/mL rhTPO (e.g., 5,000 cells resuspended in 400 μL in a 48-well plate). Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]\nInfection of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) with SARS-CoV-2\nTiming: 24–30 h\nInfect Hematopoietic cells with SARS-CoV-2 (add the virus directly into the well) at a MOI of 0.5 or 5 PFU per cell for 30 min (to analyze binding capacity of the virus to cells) or 24 h (to analyze active viral infection) in the incubator (37°C, 5% CO2).",
    "Transfer cells from the 48-well plate to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and wash three times with PBS (4 min at 300 g) to remove unbound virus prior to lysis for RNA isolation (step 60) or to culture in methylcellulose for a colony forming unit (CFU) assay (see step 64).\nSARS-Cov-2 quantification by reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR)\nTiming: 6–8 h\nAfter removing the last PBS wash, lyse the pellet with RLT buffer from the RNeasy Microkit (Qiagen, Cat# 74004) and vortex thoroughly.\nPause point: Samples can be stored in RLT buffer at −15°C to −25°C for 3–4 weeks.\nPerform RNA isolation according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nNote: To minimize loss of material, elute by adding 13 μl elution buffer. As the dead volume of the column is 2 μl, this will result in 11 μl of eluted RNA, which is the maximum volume recommended in the reverse transcription reaction.\nUse all 11 μL of RNA to perform cDNA synthesis using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# 18080051).\nAlternatives: Transcription First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche, Cat#04896866001).\nAnalyze SARS-CoV-2 detection by quantitative real-time PCR using the primers described in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1168-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. SARS-CoV-2 quantification by RT-qPCR\nRepresentative Amplification plots (A and C) and Melting Curve plots (B and D) from viral gene N. Samples that are positively infected show Ct values of 20–28 in the amplification plot (A) and clear and uniform peak in the melting curve plot (B). Notice that samples that are not infected could give a late signal, above 35 Ct (C) due to background noise (D).\nNote: We recommend using 384-well reaction plates and performing the reaction in 10 μl volume to maximize the number of reactions and target genes you can run.",
    "Colony forming unit assay and viral quantification in colonies\nTiming: 10–14 days\n(From step 58). After 24 h of infection, 5,000 cells will be seeded for 10–14 days in a methylcellulose-based medium with recombinant cytokines for human cells (StemCell Technologies, Cat#04435) following these steps:\nIncubate the different hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells during the 24 h infection period in 48 well-plates, using 400 μL media (same conditions as in step 58).\nAfter 24 h of infection, add 1 mL of methylcellulose to the media using blunt end needles.\nThoroughly mix the cells in the media with the methylcellulose using a 2 mL syringe.\nTake all the methylcellulose mix with the syringe and divide into two wells of 12 well-plates, adding 700 μL into each well.\nNote: Add 2 mL PBS into three empty wells of the 12-well plate, to prevent the methylcellulose from drying out during the incubation period. If this occurs, then it will make picking the colonies very difficult.\nIncubate for 10–14 days in the incubator (37°C, 5% CO2).\nCritical: Colony density must be appropriate for picking individual colonies. Start screening the colony plates under the microscope by day 7 to ensure that you can pick individual colonies (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1168-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

For details about the type of colonies to expect, please refer to (Huerga Encabo et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).",
    "Using the microscope make sure you choose the appropriate slide holder e.g., the adjustable version for the individual plates and the larger rectangular version for the multi-well plates used for counting.\nNote: If individual colonies are spread and visible without using a microscope you can directly pick the colonies.\nMark the plate with a pen at the bottom (i.e., at 6 o’clock) as this will be useful when rotating the plate at the end to check for colonies on the borders- you will know when you have finished as the marks will be in the same position as at the start.\nStart counting from the top left of the plate and work across. Then when reaching the other side, go down (making sure there is a little overlap from the 'row' above) and work across from right to left. Repeat this process to cover the entire area of the plate.\nAcording to the number of colonies counted, prepare 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes with 350 μL of RLT buffer from the RNeasy Microkit (Qiagen, Cat# 74004) in each. One tube will be used for every individual colony picked, so that they can be placed directly into the RLT buffer.\nPick and score each colony, using a p10 pipette set at 10 μL.\nTransfer the colony/methylcellulose mixture into the RLT buffer by pipetting up and down repeatedly. Then press all the way down to fully dispense from the pipette tip, before discarding the tip and changing to the next one.\nWork your way around the plate doing this until you reach the bottom.",
    "Note: Once done, you need to check the borders: start in the top left corner again and then rotate the plate, focusing on the same part of the plate the whole time. The idea is to find more colonies on the borders which may have been previously obscured by the margins of the plate holder. Using the mark that was made earlier, you will know once you have fully rotated the plate.\nProceed to the RNA extraction, retrotranscription and RT-qPCR (as done in steps 61 and 62) for the viral quantification from the different colonies"
