    "Appropriate institutional, ethical review board and safety approval for experiments with human tissues must be in place before working with any human tissues. All work described herein received approval from the Local Research Ethics committee (Liverpool East, REC Ref 10/H1002/49) and institutional review boards of the Research and Development Department, Liverpool Women's Hospital and University of Liverpool.\nNOTE: All biopsies described in this protocol were obtained from women undergoing pre-labor elective CS delivery at Liverpool Women's Hospital and each woman gave written informed consent to participate.\n1. Solutions\nPrepare modified Krebs physiological saline solution (PSS) with the following composition: 154 mM NaCl, 5.6 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 7.8 mM glucose, 10.9 mM HEPES, and 2.0 mM CaCl2.\n\tNOTE: The volume to be made is determined according to the number of tissue baths in operation, the flow rate of the system (1 mL/min), and estimated length of experiment including equilibration and washout time.\nAdjust pH to 7.4 using 4 M NaOH.\n2. Tissue Bath Set Up\nPreheat the tissue bath system reservoir to ~45 °C using a recirculating water bath set at 55-60 °C.\n\tNOTE: The water reservoir in the base of the apparatus is heated to ~45 °C, which after allowing for heat exchange with the PSS in the peristaltic tubing running through, ensures the PSS in the tissue bath is at 37 °C. Some adjustment to set temperatures may be needed to ensure the temperature of the PSS in the tissue bath reaches 37 °C. This will vary depending on the apparatus used and set flow rates.\nManually switch on any other necessary equipment including the amplifier, data acquisition and recording system, and suction pumps.",
    "Position each peristaltic feeder tube (one tube per bath) around the rollers of the peristaltic pump head. Secure with the retaining stops and by tightening the compression cams and locking keys around the tubes. Place the free ends of the peristaltic feeder tubes into a 1 L container of PSS and start the pump to allow the PSS to continually perfuse into the tissue baths.\nEnsure the suction pumps are operating correctly and that the level of solution in the bath is constant such that the rate of flow into the bath equals the rate of removal. The level of PSS in the tissue bath can be adjusted by manipulating the depth of the suction tube in the bath using the modeler's clay.\nCalibrate force transducers by placing a known weight (equivalent to 1 millinewton (mN, unit of force)) onto the transducer hook and recording the deflection detected by the acquisition software.\n\tNOTE: Values can be adjusted in the software such that the values recorded are automatically converted to mN negating the need to perform any further conversions during analysis. Calibration of force transducers must be performed before tissue mounting.\n3. Tissue Preparation and Dissection of Strips\nCollect biopsies of pregnant human myometrium (1–2 cm3) at CS after delivery of the baby and placenta. Obtain (typical) full thickness biopsies in which both the perimetrium (outer serosa layer of the uterus) and decidua (innermost layer of uterus) are present. Use only myometrial tissue (central muscle layer). See Figure 1A-B.\n\t\nRemove (essential) decidua and any adherent fetal membranes (if present) as these tissues are known to produce substances which can alter myometrial contractility.",
    "NOTE: In surgery, samples are placed into Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) or fresh PSS and stored at 4 °C. Ideally tissues should be used within 12-16 h of surgery, however studies have shown no detriment to contractility after 18 h of collection with storage at 4 °C51. Appropriate controls must be performed to confirm tissue viability and function after prolonged storage at 4 °C. The samples here are taken from the upper edge of the lower uterine segment incision site and not from the upper segment. The lower and upper segments of the uterus have been shown to contract similarly48, hence lower segment biopsies are considered to be a good reflection of upper segment myometrial activity.\nPrepare the dissection area and required instruments including: large dissection scissors, small Vannas dissecting scissors, two dissecting forceps, dissection pins, and aluminum tissue clips, around a dissection microscope with both fixed and zoom magnification.\nPlace the biopsy sample on a clear silastic-based dissection dish (see Table of Materials) filled with PSS and carefully orientate the biopsy so that the serosa and decidua edges are identified Figure 1B.\nUse pins to secure the biopsy to the base of the dish. Ensure the tissue remains hydrated with PSS throughout the dissection process.\nManually switch on the microscope light source and inspect the tissue under the microscope at 10x magnification to identify regions of myometrium free from scar tissue, serosa, decidua, and any adherent fetal membranes if present.\nPerform blunt dissection using large dissection scissors to separate two adjacent tissue layers, revealing two planes or sheets of muscle.\n\tNOTE: It is often easier to find a small pocket between tissue layers to begin the separation but care must be taken to avoid small vessels at the biopsy edge as they can be mistaken for 'pockets'.",
    "Place dissecting pins on each corner of the tissue to secure it. Inspect the sheets of muscle looking for regions of muscle with fibers running in parallel.\n\tNOTE: Region identification can be aided by following the direction of small capillaries perfusing through the tissue. Gentle pulling at the tissue edge can also help identify the direction in which the fibers are traveling.\nCut away strips of tissue ~ 2 mm wide x 8 mm long x 1 mm thick along the longitudinal axis aligned with the direction of the muscle fibers using small dissection scissors.\n\tNOTE: Care must be taken to only hold the tissue by the initial cut edge to avoid damage.\nRepeat the process to dissect out the number of required strips for the experiment.\nPin each strip at both ends to straighten and secure to the dish, taking care not to over stretch the tissue.\nAttach aluminum tissue clips at each end so that the tissue between them is ~ 5 mm long and carefully cut away any excess tissue (Figure 1C).\nTransfer to a clean dish filled with PSS ready for mounting.\n4. Mounting the Tissues in the Baths\nTransfer the strips to the experimental tissue baths. Mount the strips horizontally rather than vertically (as in traditional organ baths) (Figure 2B).\nAttach one end of each strip by the clip to the force transducer, which measures the tissue contraction, and the other to a fixed hook both within the tissue chamber.\n\tNOTE: The capacity of the tissue bath is ~1 mL which is large enough to ensure the strips are completely submerged in the bath.\nEnsure the strips are at the base of each hook in the bath.\nOpen the recording software by double clicking on the software icon.",
    "Adjust the recording for each channel so that it is in view in the channel window.\nAdjust the Y axis scale to read between 0-10 V (equivalent to 0-10 mN post calibration) by right clicking on the Y axis, selecting 'scale', and inputting minimum and maximum values of 0 and 10, respectively. Select 'OK'. Repeat for each channel recording.\nPress 'record' on the software to begin live recording.\n\tNOTE: If strips are not secured to the base of each hook, they could slip during contraction which will appear as a 'notch' on the recording. The set tension will change and therefore contractions post-slippage may differ.\nStretch the tissue in each bath by manually turning the micromanipulators attached to each transducer. Follow the upward tissue movement from baseline on the screen and continue to turn the micromanipulators until the baseline tension reaches 0.2 g (~2 mN).\n\tNOTE: The tissue will immediately begin to relax (noted by a drop in baseline tension), typically reaching a steady tension of between 0.5–1 mN. This defined tension has been optimized for tissue strips of this size in our experimental conditions. If other sized tissues are to be used, it is essential that appropriate length-tension relationship investigations are performed to optimize the resting force to be applied.\nAllow the tissues to equilibrate for ~ 2 h until spontaneous contractions arise.\n\tNOTE: a small elevation in baseline tension is usually observed and is a good indication of tissue viability and that it will be contractile.\n5. Challenging the Tissue with 40 mM Potassium (High K+)",
    "If no spontaneous contractions occur following 2 h of mounting, challenge the strips with a high potassium salt solution in which potassium is elevated to 40 mM by isosmotic substitution of NaCl for KCl. For the high K+, add the following (in mM): 119.6 NaCl, 40 KCl,1.2 MgSO4, 7.8 glucose, 10.9 HEPES, and 2.0 CaCl2.\n\tNOTE: In smooth muscle such as myometrium, application of high K+ causes contraction by indirectly opening voltage operated calcium channels leading to maximal influx of Ca2+ into the tissue cells. High K+ can therefore be used as a measure to test the general index of tissue integrity as well as achieving a measure of maximal tissue response.\n\t\nPlace the feeder tube for the bath containing the strip to be challenged into a glass laboratory bottle containing high K+ for 1-2 min.\nReturn the feeder tube to the container of PSS.\nWhere a response to high K+ is achieved, continue monitoring the strip for a further 1 h. If there is no contractile response to high K+ or no spontaneous activity elicited post high K+ response, discard the strip.\n\t\tNOTE: The experimenter also needs to be aware of the dead space (time taken for solution to reach the tissue bath) in the feeder tubing before assessing the response to high K+. This may take 2-3 min and will depend on flow rate.\nTo ensure complete washout of the high K+ from the bath and feeder tubes, which could affect subsequent maneuvers, wait until spontaneous contractions return to pre high K+ amplitude before proceeding further with the experiment.\n6. Testing the Effects of Known and Novel Compounds on Myometrial Contraction",
    "NOTE: Experiments to test the effect of novel drugs and reagents on myometrial function can be performed on spontaneous (Figure 3A) or agonist-stimulated contractions (Figure 3B-C). For agonist stimulated contractions, OT or arginine vasopressin (VP) is added to the PSS to give a concentration of 0.5 nM and is used throughout the experiment (Figure 3B-C). The concentration of OT has been optimized for this assay as it provides contractions which are phasic in nature40,52. Concentrations of agonists greater than this can lead to long lasting, sustained (tonic) contractions (see Ref41,44 for examples) under which the effect of various agents is difficult to assess and the experimental time frame needs to be greatly extended to accommodate the increased duration of individual contractions and reduction in frequency. In this example experiment, OT or VP is added to stimulate contractions so that antagonism by known OTR and V1aR antagonists, atosiban and SR49059, or by our novel compound [D-Arg8]-inotocin ([D-Arg8]INT), can be assessed.\nPrepare concentrations of the test compound(s) in PSS (with or without 0.5 nM OT/VP) diluted at a minimum of 1/1,000 dilution, ensuring a wide range of concentrations are included such as those that do not elicit a response to concentrations that exceed the maximal response.\nPrepare an equivalent set of dilutions involving equal volumes of vehicle (e.g., dimethyl sulfoxide, acetonitrile, or distilled water).",
    "NOTE: It is often easiest to prepare the highest concentration, i.e., 10-6 M (from a stock of 10-3 M) and then perform serial dilutions along a logarithmic scale (e.g., 10-6-10-10 M). The volume to be prepared depends upon the time of application, flow rate of the apparatus, and number of strips to be examined, e.g., for a 25 min application of reagent and a flow rate of 1 mL/min, a minimum of 25 mL of each concentration per tissue bath is required.\nApply the first concentration of compound to the tissue by placing the feeder tubing for the tissue bath into a glass laboratory bottle containing the reagent at the desired concentration.\n\tNOTE: This should be done once a steady baseline of spontaneous or OT/VP-stimulated contractions is achieved.\nApply the corresponding vehicle control solution in the same way to a second bath.\nRecord the time of application (i.e., when the feeder tubing was changed).\nRepeat the process for each concentration by sequentially placing the feeder tubing into the glass laboratory bottle containing the next concentration in the series and repeat until all concentrations have been applied.\n\tThe application of each concentration can be between 15 and 30 min but should be consistent for each concentration applied and between experiments. Those involving OT or VP-stimulated contractions tend to require the longer application periods (e.g., 25 min) to account for the reduction in contraction frequency observed under stimulation. Preliminary experiments to determine the optimal application time should be performed beforehand with any new reagent being tested.\nReturn the feeder tube to PSS (with or without OT/VP) to washout.\nClick 'stop' to end the live recording. Immediately save the data to an appropriate folder and export a version as a '.mat' file.\n7. Data Analysis",
    "NOTE: Data capture and analysis can be performed by any number of commercially available data acquisition software packages. See Table of Materials for details of software used in this protocol. For an accurate assessment of contractile activity, the parameters of contractions to be measured include: i) amplitude of contraction, ii) frequency of contraction, iii) duration of contraction, and iv) mean force integral (Figure 4). Mean force integral is the equivalent to area under the contraction curve and is therefore an index of the total work done by the tissue strip in a given time. Some or all of the parameters can be analyzed. As a minimum, it is recommended that the mean integral force and amplitude of contraction are analyzed53. In the experiments described here we measured changes in amplitude of contraction and area under the curve.\nImport the.mat file into the analysis software.\nAdjust the column corresponding to the X axis to reflect the experimental time, taking into account the sampling interval frequency. Experiments are typically recorded at 10 Hz corresponding to 10 samples/s or 600 samples/min.\nPlot the data as an X-Y co-ordinate graph using \"Plot | Line\" function.\nZero the baseline of contraction using the 'translate vertical' function on the software.\nSelect an appropriate control period.\n\tNOTE: This is the period of time immediately preceding the application of the first concentration of regent but equal to the duration of application of reagent (Figure 4A). For instance, if the application of drug X is for 25 min, use the 25 min preceding the first application of drug X as the control.\nRead off the Y axis, record the amplitude (force) of contraction at the max peak of each contraction occurring in the timeframe selected, and calculate a mean value.",
    "Measure the duration of contraction at 50% of this maximum peak by reading off the X axis at the start and end of each contraction and record a mean value.\nCount the number of contractions occurring in the time frame to generate a value for frequency.\nUse the 'integration' function to calculate AUC (in arbitrary units, a.u.) for the period of time selected.\n\tNOTE: To record AUC accurately, it is essential that the baseline of the contractions is set at zero on the Y axis.\nSequentially move through each of the concentrations and record the different parameters of contraction.\nSet the control data as 100% and express the values obtained under each concentration of reagent as a percentage of this control i.e., values for stimulation should be >100% whilst relaxation should be <100%.\n\tNOTE: Normalizing the data in this way should allow the user to compare results across strips and pharmacological treatments.\nRepeat for each experiment and transfer the data to a graphical package."
