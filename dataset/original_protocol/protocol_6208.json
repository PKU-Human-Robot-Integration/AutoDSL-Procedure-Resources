    "Sequential immunofluorescence (IF) and single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH)Note: We follow the sequential IF and smFISH protocol described by the manufacturer of smFISH probes (Biosearch Technologies, Petaluma, CA) with some modifications detailed below.IFNote: Use nuclease-free water for preparing all reagents for the sequential IF and smFISH experiment to limit potential RNA degradation.  Place a 12-mm circular coverslip to each well of a 24-well plate. Seed about 5 x 104 cells to each well. Allow cells to attach onto the coverslips.When the cells reach 75-90% confluency in each well (12-18 h for most human cultured cells), fix cells with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (1x PBS) for 10 min at room temperature (RT), followed by two quick washes with 1x PBS.Note: To perform quick washes, gently transfer 1 ml of PBS to each well and then aspirate the solution immediately. Permeabilize cells with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1x PBS for 5 min at RT, followed by one quick wash with 1x PBS.Incubate cells (on a 12-mm circular coverslip) with 70 µl of primary antibody solution for 3 h at RT (e.g., 1:1,000 dilution of rabbit anti-PCNT antibody in 1x PBS in our example).Perform three 5-min washes with 1x PBS and incubate the cells with 70 µl of secondary antibody solution overnight in the dark at 4 °C (e.g., 1:500 diluted anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488). Note: The dilution factor and incubation time of the primary and secondary antibodies need to be empirically determined; the sample condition described is for detecting PCNT proteins. To perform 5-min washes, gently transfer the coverslip to a well in a 24-well plate containing 1 ml of 1x PBS. Incubate for 5 min at RT without shaking the plate. Perform three 5-min washes with 1x PBS and post-fix cells with 3.",
    "7% formaldehyde in 1x PBS for 10 min at RT.smFISHWash cells with Wash Buffer A for 5 min and incubate with 67 µl of Hybridization Buffer containing 125 nM smFISH DNA probe mix for 6 h at 37 °C in the dark.Note: We use the online Stellaris Probe Designer from Biosearch Technologies to design the FISH probes. We generally use a set of 48 to 96 20-mer DNA probes for each RNA target. For best results, add 10% formamide into 1x Wash Buffer A and Hybridization Buffer immediately before use.Incubate cells with Wash Buffer A for 30 min at 37 °C, Wash Buffer A containing 0.05 µg/ml DAPI for 30 min at 37 °C, and Wash Buffer B for 3 min at RT.Mount the coverslip with enough Prolong Gold antifade mountant (e.g., 5 µl for a 12-mm circular coverslip). Let the mountant cure overnight in the dark at RT and seal the edge of the coverslip with nail polish before imaging. Note: For the best results, perform the incubations of antibody and smFISH probes in a humidified container (e.g., a 15-cm Petri dish with a piece of parafilm and wet paper towel inside, wrapped with aluminum foil to block light). Image acquisition and deconvolutionImaging Note: When using multiple fluorophores, it is important to carefully select the wavelength ranges, emission filters, and dichroic mirrors to avoid signal bleed-through. Use settings to minimize photobleaching but also maximize the signal-to-noise ratio. A camera with high sensitivity is preferred to obtain good smFISH signals (e.g., an electron multiplying CCD camera). We recommend acquiring images sequentially, channel by channel, starting from the longest wavelength. Below are the general IF and smFISH acquisition settings using the Dragonfly spinning confocal system in the Jao lab.Objective: 100x NA 1.4 (as well as placing a 1.",
    "5x or 2x magnification lens before the camera)Laser power: between 5-30% of 50-100 mW lasersExposure time: 100-250 msGain: 200 for iXon Ultra 888 EMCCD cameraPinhole: 40 µmZ-stack interval: 0.3 µmFor assessing colocalization between different fluorescent signals, acquire all channels for each z-stack.Deconvolution Note: It is important to avoid potential artifacts introduced during the deconvolution process by comparing the pre- and post-deconvolved images. In general, the higher the number of iterations, the more likely image artifacts will be produced. Below are our typical deconvolution settings using the built-in deconvolution algorithm in the Fusion software of the Dragonfly system.Deconvolution preview mode: ONAlgorithm: Robust (Iterative)Pre-sharpening: OFFEdge artifact reduction: noneDenoising filter size: 0.7Denoising frequency: 4Number of iterations: 15Minimum intensity removal: ONInitial denoising: ONNormalization: OFFIteration acceleration: OFF"
