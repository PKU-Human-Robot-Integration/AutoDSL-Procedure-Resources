    "Blood collectionNotes: To exclude pre-sensitization events, male subjects without blood transfusion history or previous organ transplantation are preferred. Subjects must be healthy and not related. A written informed consent must be obtained from each individual enrolled in the study.  The ethics committee of your respected institute/country must formally approve your study, providing also a study protocol number. The whole procedure requires aseptic conditions, the use of sterile reagents and plastic ware is highly recommended.  With a sterile blood syringe, draw about 20 ml of blood from each individual and immediately dispense it into a pre-labeled K3-EDTA vacuum blood collection tube (one tube/donor). Invert the tube several times for the blood to mix properly with K3-EDTA and, keep the collection tubes in a cold environment (4 °C, incubation time can be no longer than 2 h) until PBMCs isolation commences.PBMCs isolationNotes: The whole procedure must be performed inside a sterile cabinet (hood). Whether you use a swinging bucket centrifuge rotor, or a rotor with a fixed angle will not significantly affect the total numbers of isolated PMBCs. During Step B1, layering of blood on the Ficoll Histopaque should be done really gently in order not to disturb the Ficoll layer (Ficoll allows for elimination of dead cells). Following these instructions, a proper isolation should yield 1.8-2.3 x 106 PBMCs/1 ml of blood of a healthy individual. The ratio of blood to Ficoll Histopaque volume should be 1:1. Dependent on the volume of blood collected, add the same total volume of Ficoll into a 50 ml conical tube per donor. Slowly add the blood of each individual with a plastic Pasteur pipette at the surface of the Ficoll without disturbing it.Immediately centrifuge the tubes containing Ficoll and blood at 400 x g for 25 min at room temperature (RT).",
    "Make sure that the deceleration speed of the centrifuge machine is 0.Using a sterile plastic Pasteur pipette carefully breach the plasma layer and, without disturbing the Ficoll Histopaque layer, aspirate the white PBMCs layer (“buffy” coat) formed in the interphase between blood plasma and Ficoll Histopaque (Figure 2). Pour the PBMCs into a new 15 ml conical tube.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190113/20190113184912_5853.jpgFigure 2. Isolation of PBMCs. Layers of Ficoll Histopaque and whole blood prior to (A) and after (B) centrifugation showing the separation of layers in the conical tube. Add RPMI 1640 cell culture medium without phenol red up to 15 ml for each PBMCs collected.Pellet PBMCs by centrifuging samples at 315 x g for 10 min at RT. Revert deceleration speed to normal (6 on Centurion Scientific centrifuge).Remove the supernatant, wash cell pellet with 10 ml of RPMI 1640 cell culture medium without phenol red and centrifuge samples at 315 x g for 10 min at RT.Remove the supernatant and resuspend each cellular pellet with 2 ml of complete RPMI medium (10% FBS, 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution) and count them using Neubauer chamber. Mix 90 μl of trypan blue solution and 10 μl of cells into a clean Eppendorf tube, load the Neubauer chamber and begin counting immediately under a microscope at the lowest magnification. Prolonged overstaining with trypan blue solution stains all cells blue. Always count the viable cells that appear as spherical white cells. Use of trypan blue allows for distinction of dead cells from live cells, since dead cells are stained in blue. A detailed protocol for cell counting using a Neubauer chamber was discussed in (Phelan and Lawler, 2001).Assessment of humoral alloimmunityNotes:As already mentioned, a 7-day incubation period in Step C1f is necessary for the development of IgM and IgG alloantibodies.",
    "Any drug treatment should last for the entirety of the period. During Step C3a, seed the appropriate number of cells that you will need to generate enough wells to assess humoral immunity in non-treated cells, treated cells and control cells. We recommend to perform nine to twelve identical experiments, each in triplicate, and the results should refer to the mean of the three measurements. Low-Tox-H rabbit complement is provided as a lyophilized compound. Shortly before the use of Low-Tox-H rabbit complement, reconstitute it with 1 ml of ice-cold distilled water (reconstitute during the 30 min incubation on ice during Step C3f). According to the manufacturer's instructions, the complement must be stored at 4 °C for a maximum of one hour after reconstitution.  Have access to an ELISA plate reader capable of reading wavelengths at 490 nm and 630 nm, respectively. Make sure to remove any bubble formed in the XTT 96-well plate before reading the plate with an ELISA plate reader machine. Any foam or bubble will negatively impact OD readings. The tip of a syringe works best for bubble or foam removal. Preparation of one-way MLRResuspend 0.5 x 106 PBMCs in 500 μl with complete RPMI from each sample and transfer them into a sterile 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tube. Treat them with 50 μg/ml mitomycin C for 30 min at 37 °C. These are the stimulator cells.Centrifuge cells at 300 x g for 5 min at RT, remove supernatant and wash cells with Dulbecco’s phosphate buffer saline.Repeat Step C1b two more times.Seed 0.5 x 106 stimulator cells/well resuspended in 250 μl complete RPMI into a 24-well plate. To each well already containing the 0.5 x 106 stimulator cells, add 0.",
    "5 x 106 resting PBMCs (resuspended in 250 μl complete RPMI) from a different donor; these are the responder cells (e.g., stimulator cells from donor A with responder cells from donor B). Together stimulator and responder cells constitute the MLR.Incubate MLR for 7 days at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator with or without the treatment that is under your investigation. The treatment of choice should be added right at the start of the 7-day incubation period. Culture media must not be changed during the 7-day incubation. Preparation of resting PBMCsIn parallel to the preparation of one-way MLR (Steps C1a-C1f), resting PBMCs samples should be prepared. Resuspend 1 x 106 PBMCs in 2 ml of complete RPMI and transfer the cells into one well of 6-well plate. Prepare as many wells as needed. These cells are the resting PBMCs.Incubate resting PBMCs for 7 days at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator, without changing the culture media during the 7-day incubation period.Antibody-mediated complement-dependent cytotoxicityOnce the 7-day period is over, count the viable resting PBMCs from each well. Counting of cells from each resting PBMCs sample is laborious. It has to be done for each sample, as it will ensure accurate counting of resting cells, excluding proliferation or apoptotic rates during the 7-day period that may greatly vary between PBMCs populations from different blood donor individuals. Following counting, resuspend 0.5 x 105 resting PBMCs into 50 μl of complete RPMI and seed 50 μl of cells/well into a flat bottom 96-well plate. The above resting PBMCs must be derived from the same individual that also provided the stimulator PBMCs of the one-way MLR (as seen in Figure 1, e.g., PBMC A individual). Humoral alloimmunity will be evaluated in the person who provided the responder PBMCs (as seen in Figure 1, e.g.",
    ", responder PBMC B individual).Once the 7-day period is over, centrifuge each 24-well plate containing the MLR, from Step C1f, on a Cell Plate Centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min at RT.Collect the supernatant from each MLR. The volume of the supernatant should be around 450-500 μl. Please be gentle during handing and pipetting, in order not to accidentally pick any centrifuged cells.Add 50 μl from each MLR supernatant or 50 μl of complete RPMI (control) into the wells of that 96-well plate containing the resting target PBMCs. In addition, in an empty well add 100 μl of complete RPMI that will serve as the blank well for the XTT assay. It is recommended to generate nine to twelve control wells for statistical analysis.Incubate the 96-well plate on ice for 30 min inside the hood.After the 30 min incubation, add 11 μl of rabbit complement Low-Tox-H rabbit complement (10% [v/v], working concentration) in each well (samples, controls, blanks) at a final concentration of 10%. Now the total volume in each well should be 111 μl. Incubate the 96-well plate at 37 °C for 2 h in a CO2 incubator.Immediately before the end of the incubation period, prepare the XTT working solution from the XTT assay kit that will be used to measure cell survival via colorimetry. Briefly and according to the manufacturer’s protocol, add 100 μl of the XTT activator to 5 ml of XTT reagent in order to prepare the XTT working solution. Once the 2 h incubation is over (Step C3i), add 50 μl of the XTT working solution to each well of the 96-well plate and mix gently. Return the plate at 37 °C for another hour in the CO2 incubator.",
    "Read the absorbance of your samples using an ELISA Plate Reader set at 490 nm with a reference correction at 630 nm.After subtracting background OD values derived from the blank wells, calculate cell survival in each sample by the equation: Cell survival (%) = (XTT assay OD of the evaluated condition/XTT assay OD of the control) x 100. The lesser the cell survival, the higher the production of alloantibodies in one-way MLR and, consequently the more potent the humoral alloimmunity."
