    "1. Preparing the Mouse\nInduce general anesthesia in the mouse with isoflurane gas. Inject 0.15 ml of intraperitoneal brupenorphine for pain management. Before proceeding, check if the anesthesia level is satisfactory by pricking the mouse's paws.\nPut the mouse in dorsal recumbencyÂ with the four limbs fixed by adhesive tape. Remove the hair of the neck and the upper chest with scissors. Via subcutaneous injection, administer 0.2-0.4 ml of 0.9% saline to keep the mouse hydrated during the surgical procedure.\nPrepare the operative field following a strict sterile method. The area of the skin incision should be cleaned with 90% alcohol.\n2. Dissecting the Common Carotid Artery and the External Jugular Vein\nMake a horizontal midline cervical incision across the lower neck area of the mouse. After deepening the wound, elevate the salivary glands and cervical soft tissue by using a traction suture (Figure 1). Expose the right external jugular vein (EJV) lateral to the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM). This step should be performed under the microscope, since excessive traction over the vein might damage it and induce its thrombosis.\nCarefully dissect the right EJV along its course from the clavicle to the skull base. Usually electric bipolar forceps, coagulate and divide any branches to prepare an adequate length for the later temporary clip placement and anastomosis.\nLateral to the trachea and medial to the SCM, explore the common carotid artery (CCA). It should be carefully exposed from the clavicle to just beyond its bifurcation into the external and internal carotid arteries. During this step, attention should be given again to avoid excessive traction to the EJV that could later compromise the patency of the anastomosis.\n3. Preparing the Anastomosis",
    "Ligate the CCA with 10-0 Nylon just proximal to its bifurcation. Next, apply a temporary clip over the proximal CCA as close to the clavicle as possible.\nOnce the flow has been interrupted, transect the artery just under the bifurcation ligature and irrigate it with saline to wash out any remaining blood inside the lumen. Avoid bipolar coagulation in this step, since thermal injury to the artery wall could put the future anastomosis in jeopardy.\nIn order to improve the visibility of the edges of the EJV, the medial wall is marked with a blue marking pen along the course of the planned venotomy. Once the EJV is marked, use a 10-0 suture to ligate the distal end as caudal as possible and apply a temporary vascular clip on the proximal end as cranial as possible.\nWith a fine 30 G needle and 0.5 ml syringe, make an initial aperture over the marked area of the EJV and immediately irrigate the lumen with saline to avoid thrombus formation. Next, extend the venotomy with the microscissors until the length is about 2-3 times the diameter of the CCA. Avoid violent stretching and pay attention to keep a sharp and neat cutting edge.\nApproximate the end of the CCA to the EJV. Make a side-cut incision in the donor end of the CCA to adjust the diameter to the length to the venotomy size (Figure 2).\n4. End-to-side Anastomosis",
    "Use a 11-0 monofilament nylon suture for the CCA-to-EJV end-to-side anastomosis. Suturing the medial wall of the anastomosis in a craneo-caudal direction is the initial step. Every stitch should be placed from outside-in the venous wall first (Figure 3) and from inside-out the arterial wall (Figure 4) next. This will keep the knot on the outside surface of the anastomotic vessels at all times (Figure 5). Either interrupted or continuous sutures can be used, but all continuous sutures should be tightened as the final step.\nOnce the medial wall has been sutured, repeat the procedure from caudal to cranial with the lateral wall. Now every stitch should be placed from outside-in the arterial wall first and from inside-out the venous wall next. Saline irrigation will help keep the lumen of the anastomosis visible at all times during the procedure.\nAfter finishing all the steps of the anastomosis, remove the temporary clip from the vein first and from the artery next. The arterial blood will flow into the EJV with no or little oozing from the anastomosis (see videos VH model and VH model2). The minimal bleeding should stop without using cotton compression over the anastomosis. This must be avoided in order to prevent thrombosis of the delicate vein.\nOnce pulsatile flow through the anastomosis is confirmed and no apparent bleeding is observed, irrigate the surgical field with saline and close the cervical incision with a 6-0 nylon suture. Finally, administer 0.15 ml more of intraperitoneal brupenorphine for postoperative pain management and 0.2-0.4 ml of subcutaneous 0.9% saline to replenish any blood loss during the surgery.\nSubscription Required.
