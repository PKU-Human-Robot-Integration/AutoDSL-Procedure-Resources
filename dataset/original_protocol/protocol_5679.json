    "Measuring intracellular ROS of nematodes under normal culture conditionsPreparation of a synchronized nematode populationWash a plate containing full adults and eggs with 1 ml of M9 buffer. Transfer nematode suspension into a microcentrifuge tube.Spin down at 3,884 x g (rcf; 8,500 rpm) for 1 min and remove the supernatant.Add 200 μl of Distilled Water (D.W.) and 800 μl of bleaching solution. Wait until over 90% of nematodes have lysed and several embryos are released [please see Section 3.2 in Bianchi and Driscoll (2006)].Note: Check for lysis every 30 sec after 3 min. Vortexing at maximum speed for about 2-3 sec helps with bleach lysis.Spin down at 3,884 x g (rcf; 8,500 rpm) for 1 min and remove the supernatant. Note: Be careful not to disturb the pellet.Wash three times with M9 buffer (1 ml each): Spin down at 137 x g (rcf; 1,000 rpm) for 1 min and remove the supernatant.Transfer embryos with 1 ml of M9 buffer to a conical tube containing 1 ml of M9 (total 2 ml).Incubate overnight at 20 °C with shaking at 30 rpm to allow L1 larvae to hatch.Counting animals and preparation of nematode solutionResuspend the larva pellet and spread 10 μl of the suspension onto a glass slide. Do this in triplicate. Count the number of nematodes using a dissecting stereomicroscope and calculate the average number of L1 larvae in each drop.Add an appropriate volume of M9 buffer to dilute the larva suspension.Shake gently and count again.Repeat Steps A2b-A2d until the number of nematodes arrives to around 50 per 10 μl.Preparation of H2DCFDA reaction solutionPrepare a concentrated stock (50 mM) by dissolving 24.365 mg of H2DCFDA in 1 ml of cell culture grade DMSO.",
    "Split into 100 μl aliquots in black microcentrifuge tubes and store at -20 °C (stable for at least 3 months).Dilute stock solution to 50 μM with M9 buffer as required (volume required = number of test wells x 50 μl).Note: Working solution should be prepared shortly before use.Determination of intracellular ROS levels using a fluorophotometerTurn on the fluorophotometer and set plate settings.Add 40 μl of M9 buffer into the wells of a black 96-well plate.Add 10 μl of nematode solution (prepared in Step A2) into each well.Add 50 μl of H2DCFDA reaction solution to a final concentration of 25 μM.Prepare blank wells by adding 50 μl of M9 and 50 μl of H2DCFDA reaction solution.Immediately, insert the plate into the fluorophotometer and let gently shake for 30 sec.Quantify the fluorescence intensity at an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and an emission wavelength of 510-570 nm.Measure fluorescence signal every hour (maximum 6 h) and export raw data through USB port (see Figure 2A).Note: All steps should be done at RT.Measuring intracellular ROS of nematodes under oxidative stress conditionsParaquat-induced oxidative stressMake 50 mM paraquat solution by dissolving methyl viologen dichloride hydrate (paraquat) powder in D.W.Prepare arrested L1 larvae as described in Step A1.Add 1 part 50 mM paraquat to 9 parts L1-containing M9 buffer (1:10 dilution) and incubate at 20 °C for 2 h with shaking at 30 rpm in the shaking incubator.Wash three times with M9 buffer (1 ml each): Spin down at 137 x g (rcf; 1,000 rpm) for 1 min and remove the supernatant.Prepare nematode solution as described in Step A2.Quantify intracellular ROS levels as described in Steps A3 and A4.Heat-induced oxidative stressPrepare arrested L1 larvae and nematode solution as described in Steps A1 and A2.",
    "Incubate nematodes at 30 °C for 2 h with shaking at 30 rpm in the shaking incubator.Quantify intracellular ROS levels as described in Steps A3 and A4. Note: Maintain the fluorophotometer temperature at 30 °C throughout the measurement."
