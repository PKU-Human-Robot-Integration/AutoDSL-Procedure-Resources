    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDAY 1 – preparing lens organ cultures\nTiming: ∼1 h per 30 eggs\nThis section describes the preparation of lens organ cultures isolated from chick embryos, in which lenses continue to undergo normal development as occurs in vivo, including the elimination of organelles to form the lens Organelle Free Zone.\nIsolate embryonic chicken lenses (E12) – about 5 lenses/condition for immunolocalization studies and 5–10 lenses/condition for immunoblot studies – perform all steps under sterile conditions.\nPlace 4 100 mm petri dishes in a laminar flow hood.\nUse one dish to crack eggs and decapitate embryos using sharp Dumont Standard Tip Forceps (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], steps 1 and 2).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2977-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Isolating embryonic chick lenses\n(A) Eggs are cracked one at a time into a 100mm Petri dish where the embryos are decapitated, an incision is made along the equator of the eye to allow the lens/vitreous to roll out with the least amount of damage to the lens, the lenses are then pinched off from the vitreous and placed into well plates with Complete Medium to create lens organ cultures.\n(B) First the head is removed, after which an incision is made in the eye to create an opening from which the lens together with its associated vitreous is rolled out (corresponding to Steps A3-4).\nPlace the heads in a separate dish filled with Tris-Dextrose buffer (in Materials and equipment) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], step 3).\nMove one head at a time to another dish filled with Tris-Dextrose buffer. Use standard forceps to cut open the eye along the equator to create an opening large enough to roll out the lens together with its attached vitreous humor (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], step 4a-b).",
    "Remove the lens/vitreous by grabbing the vitreous with standard forceps (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], step 4b-c) and placing it in the last dish which is filled with Complete Medium (in Materials and equipment) prewarmed to 37°C (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], step 5).\nUnder the microscope, place one lens/vitreous on a petri dish lid (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], step 6a).\nUse forceps to stabilize the vitreous while using another set of forceps to pinch underneath the lens to detach the lens from the vitreous (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], step 6). The lenses will be used in lens organ cultures.\nLens organ cultures\nAfter removing the lens from the vitreous, immediately transfer each isolated lens to a 48 well plate filled with 0.5 mL Complete Medium per well. Place each lens in a separate well.\nOnce the lenses are added to the 48 well plate, place the plate in a 37°C humidified tissue culture incubator with 5% CO2 and normoxia for 1 h.\nAfter 1 h of incubation, remove any lenses that develop opacities from the study prior to treatments.\nNote: This lens organ culture protocol is a modification of one that was previously published.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]\nNote: The frequency of lenses that develop opacities will depend on how gently the lenses are handled as any damage by the forceps will result in opacities. One should practice making lens organ cultures to understand how many eggs/lenses one needs to have enough transparent lenses for an experiment.\nDAY 1 – Use of signaling pathway inhibitors in lens organ cultures\nTiming: 30 min\nThis section provides the protocol for treating chick embryo lenses in organ culture to signaling pathway inhibitors for the purpose of evaluating the role of the targeted pathways in the differentiation of lens fiber cells and the development of the lens.",
    "Prepare the inhibitors which will be used to treat the lens organ cultures.\nDilute inhibitors from a stock solution of 10 mM in 37°C pre-warmed Complete Medium.\nUse the vehicle of the inhibitors, DMSO, as control. The largest volume of inhibitor used in the experiment is that of the vehicle DMSO, which is diluted using Complete Medium prewarmed to 37°C prior to adding to the control lenses.\nOnce the inhibitors are added to the media, place the well plate in a 37°C humidified tissue culture incubator with 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nDetermine the efficacy of inhibitors to block a signaling pathway by examining impact on downstream signaling effectors using an immunoblot approach.\nNote: To study PI3K inhibition, the inhibitors we used included the pan-PI3K inhibitors LY294002 (100 μM, Selleckchem) or CH5132799 (25 μM or 100 μM, Selleckchem) or the Akt-specific inhibitor MK-2206 (10 μM, Selleckchem). Efficacy of PI3K inhibitors to block PI3K signaling pathways was determined based on inhibition of Akt activity using an immunoblot approach.\nDAY 2 – Immunolocalization protocol\nTiming: 26 h\nTiming: 2 h (for step 6)\nTiming: 24 h (for step 7)\nThis section describes the first steps in preparing lenses for immunolocalization analysis that includes protein fixation and cryoprotection of the lenses, so that tissue integrity is preserved through the next steps.\nFixation\nWash lenses twice with PBS (in the 48 well plate) and then fix with 0.5 mL/well 4% paraformaldehyde (16% paraformaldehyde stock solution diluted in PBS) for 2 h at 4°C.\nCryoprotection\nWash lenses twice with PBS and then cryoprotect in 0.5 mL/well 30% sucrose (in PBS) for 24 h at 4°C.\nNote: May store lenses in sucrose for 1 month.\nDAY 2 – Immunoblotting protocol\nTiming: ∼4 hrs\nTiming: ∼1 min per lens (for step 8)",
    "Timing: 2 h (for step 9)\nTiming: 1 h (for step 10)\nThis section describes the protocol for preparing the treated lenses for an analysis of protein expression that will use a biochemical approach. Since we are examining the impact of signaling pathway inhibitors on features of lens differentiation, the first step described here is to separate the three primary regions of differentiation by microdissection, followed by how to extract the protein and determine the protein concentration in each sample.\nMicrodissection of lenses\nUsing a dissecting microscope and standard forceps, microdissect each lens to yield three unique differentiation state specific fractions.\nPlace a lens on the lid of a 100 mm petri dish. Remove the lens epithelium first, then separate the cortical fiber cells from the central, nuclear fiber cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2977-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Microdissection of lenses into three differentiation state specific regions\n(A and B) Under a dissecting microscope, forceps are used to create a shallow puncture in the anterior epithelium, denoted by (E), located at the top of the lens. The tear in the epithelium is widened and the epithelium is grabbed along the tear by the tips of the forceps following which the entire epithelium pulled away from the fiber cell mass as seen in (A). Forceps are then used to remove the cortical fiber cells (FP) from the central fiber cells (FC), shown in (B). This process is relatively straightforward as the cells in the FC form a tightly packed mass in the center of the lens, while the FP consists of a looser aggregate of cells. Each microdissected region is then placed/stored in Imidazole Buffer until it is time to perform protein extraction.",
    "Repeat the microdissection procedure for each lens in the study and place the individual tissue fractions on ice in separate 0.5 mL microfuge tubes containing 1-2 μL Imidazole Buffer per lens dissected (in Materials and equipment) with protease/phosphatase inhibitors to protect against serine/threonine/tyrosine phosphatases (in key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) at 1:100 dilution, combining all like fractions together in one tube.\nNote: At this point in the protocol samples can be stored at -80°C until ready to use.\nNote: The lens microdissection protocol is a modification of one that was previously published.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]\nProtein extraction\nAdd the extraction buffer, 2X OG/T (in Materials Table), to each sample at an equal volume to the Imidazole Buffer.\nHomogenize the tissue using disposable plastic pestles that fit the microfuge tube; continue homogenizing until tissue pieces are no longer visible (approximately 30 s).\nIncubate the homogenized tissue on ice for 15 min.\nCentrifuge the extracted samples for 5 min at 15000 x g.\nRemove the supernatant carefully and place in new microfuge tubes.\nNote: May store extracted samples at -80°C until ready to use.\nBCA Protein Assay\nDilute samples in Imidazole Buffer (in Materials Table).\nDilute epithelial cell samples obtained from 5-10 lenses as above at 1:20 for the protein assay.\nDilute fiber cell samples obtained from 5-10 lenses as above at 1:80.\nGenerate a standard curve (0.025 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL) using Bovine Serum Albumin protein standards. Load 5 μL in triplicate in a 96 well plate.\nLoad each sample at 5 μL in triplicate.\nLoad a blank sample at 5 μL in triplicate (Imidazole Buffer).\nMix reagents A and B in a 50:1 ratio and add 200 μL of this solution to each well.\nCover and incubate the plate for 30 min at 37°C.\nMeasure the absorbance at 562nm on a SpectraMax 360 plate reader.",
    "Note: The protein extracted from 5-10 lenses is about 10 μg for epithelial cell fractions and 15 μg each for cortical fiber and nuclear fiber cell fractions.\nNote: May store samples at -80°C until ready to use.\nDAY 3 – Immunolocalization protocol\nTiming: ∼2 days\nTiming: ∼2 min per lens (for step 11)\nTiming: 30 min–1 h per lens (for step 12)\nTiming: 1–2 days (for step 13)\nThis section shows how to properly freeze the cryoprotected lenses, section them using a cryostat, and then provides a detailed guide to the immunolabeling of lens sections.\nFreezing lenses\nRemove lenses from the sucrose cryoprotectant using forceps and embed in about 4 mL tissue freezing media in a (22 × 22mm) square mold (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2977-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Embedding/freezing lenses in tissue freezing media to allow for cryosectioning\nLenses are positioned within the tissue freezing media so that the equatorial epithelium is facing up and the anterior/posterior sides of the lens are facing to the right and left. When these lenses are cryosectioned, all of the different differentiation state specific regions of the lens are visible at once.\nPosition lenses under a dissecting scope so that the equatorial region is facing up (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nFreeze lenses embedded in freezing media by placing the mold in a dry ice/ethanol bath (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nCryosectioning\nSection frozen blocks using a Microm HM 500 Cryostat, typically cutting 20 μm thick sections (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2977-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Cryosectioning frozen tissue\nEmbedded lenses are mounted to the chuck and sections are cut. They are then transferred to microscope slides on which they can be immunostained.\nPick up frozen sections on a microscope slide by touching the slide to the tissue (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nNote: Frozen blocks are stored at -80°C and cut sections are stored at -20°C.",
    "Note: Cryostat is set to -25°C. Blocks are placed inside for a minimum of 20 minutes prior to sectioning to allow tissue to acclimate.\nNote: Cryosections can be cut at 6–20 μm.\nImmunostaining\nChoose sections that were cut through the center of the lens.\nUsing a hydrophobic pen, draw a square around each section.\nAdd 100 μL Permeabilization Buffer (in Materials Table) to the square created with the hydrophobic pen. Incubate for 30 min at ∼22°C. This step will remove traces of freezing media before staining.\nRemove the Permeabilization Buffer.\nIncubate the sections in 100 μL Block Buffer (in Materials Table) at ∼22°C for 1 h.\nRemove Block Buffer.\nIncubate sections in primary antibodies diluted in Block Buffer at either 37°C for 3 h or 4°C for ∼16 h.\nRemove primary antibody and wash sections with PBS for 5 min 3 times.\nIncubate with appropriate secondary antibody diluted in the Block Buffer and containing DAPI (1:1000) at 37°C for 2 h.\nRemove secondary antibody and wash sections with PBS for 5 min 3 times.\nAdd a drop of ProLong Diamond Antifade mounting media and cover with a Microscope Cover Glass coverslip.\nNote: Center sections are used exclusively as organelle loss is initiated in the center of the lens.\nNote: For secondary alone control studies it is not necessary to use centermost sections.\nNote: Acclimate the frozen sections to 22°C (about 10 minutes) before beginning the immunolocalization protocol.\nNote: It may be necessary to optimize incubation times for some primary antibodies.\nDAY 3 – Immunoblotting protocol\nTiming: ∼2 h–3 days depending on technique used\nTiming: 2 h (for step 14)\nTiming: 2–3 days (for step 15)",
    "In this section we describe two very different immunoblotting protocols that can be used to accomplish the goal of determining and quantifying protein expression, one using the WES Simple Western System from Bio-Techne and a more typical Western Blot approach. The WES immunoblot provides a fast, highly reproducible method of immunoblotting in which all samples, antibodies, and reagents are loaded into a plate and proteins are separated by capillary electrophoresis. The WES system also quantifies the results. For Western blotting, the protocol described here includes the steps involved in gel electrophoresis, transfer to a PDVF membrane, and the exposure of the membrane to the primary antibody.\nWES Immunoblot\nPrepare samples to be loaded and run. For each well that will be run on a WES, the preparation must include your sample, 0.6 μL of Fluorescent Master Mix (provided with the manufacturer’s EZ Standard Pack), and bring your sample to a final volume of 3 μL with sample buffer (diluted to 0.1X from 10X sample buffer stock provided with the manufacturer’s Separation Module). While the ratios of these reagents will stay the same, the final volumes should reflect the number of wells that will be loaded with the sample.\nHeat the prepared samples (as above) at 100°C for 5 min.\nLoad 5 μL of a biotinylated ladder (included with the EZ Standard Pack) into the first well of the first row. Then load the prepared samples into the rest of the first row of wells of the plate, 3 μL /well (provided in the 12–230 kDa Separation Module). There are 24 wells available for sample loading (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2977-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Loading of WES plate",
    "Each reagent is loaded into specific wells at specific volumes within the WES plate. The plate is centrifuged, the seal covering the bottom of the plate is removed, and the plate is placed into the WES machine with a set of capillaries prior to running.\nLoad antibody Diluent II (provided with the 12–230 kDa Separation Module) at 10 μL /well into the second row of the plate (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nFor the ladder, load Antibody Diluent II (provided with the 12–230 kDa Separation Module) into the first well of the third row (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nDilute primary antibodies in Antibody Diluent II to an optimized concentration. Load 10 μL/well across the third row (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nFor the ladder, load 10 μL Streptavidin HRP (provided with the Anti-Rabbit/Mouse Detection kit) into the first well of the fourth row (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nLoad 10 μL of secondary antibody (provided with the Anti-Rabbit/Mouse Detection kits) to the remainder of the wells across the fourth row (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nMix luminol and peroxide (provided with the Anti-Rabbit/Mouse Detection kit) in a 1:1 ratio and add to all the wells in the fifth row at 15 μL /well (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nCover the plate with the supplied lid and centrifuge at 1000 x g for 5 min.\nLoad 500 μL of wash buffer (provided with the 12–230 kDa Separation Module) in all the wells of the seventh, eighth, and ninth rows (these are the first 3 rows of larger wells) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nRemove the seal from the lower part of the plate, just prior to running.\nLoad the plate and a set of capillaries (part of 12–230 kDa Separation Module) into the WES machine.\nUsing Bio-Techne’s Compass software, label a plate template with the contents of each well.\nNote: Plate will run for about 3 hrs.",
    "Note: The optimal protein concentration for each sample is between 0.005-3 μg.\nhttps://resources.bio-techne.com/bio-techne-assets/docs/software/Simple%20Western/Wes/Wes%20User%20Guide_Rev%208.pdf[href=https://resources.bio-techne.com/bio-techne-assets/docs/software/Simple%20Western/Wes/Wes%20User%20Guide_Rev%208.pdf].\nWestern blot\nPolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (3 h)\nPrepare samples for electrophoresis using Novex Tris-Glycine 10 well gels. The volume per well should not exceed 40 μL after adding an equal volume of 2X Sample Buffer (formulation found in Materials Table). Optimal protein concentration for lens fiber cell lysates is approximately 50 μg/well. While the ratios of these reagents will stay the same, the final volumes should reflect the number of wells that will be loaded with the sample.\nAfter adding 2x Sample Buffer at a 1:1 ratio, heat samples for 10 min at 100°C.\nChoose pre-made polyacrylamide gradient gels of either 4%–12% or 8%–16% (10 wells/gel) depending on the molecular weights of the proteins to be examined.\nWash the wells in each lane 3 times with 1x Running buffer (in Materials Table), leaving running buffer in at the last wash step.\nPlace gel in an XCell SureLock Mini-Cell Electrophoresis apparatus. This apparatus is able to run two gels simultaneously, if only running one gel, use a place holder in the position of second gel. Fill middle of apparatus with 1x Running buffer.\nConnect to power source and run at 80 V until bands run through stacking gel, then increase up to 120 V.\nStop when the dye front reaches the bottom of the gel.\nTransferring the protein bands from the gel to a PVDF membrane (4 h)\nCut the PVDF membrane to the size of the gel (8 cm × 8 cm).\nIn a small tray, hydrate the PVDF membrane in 100% methanol for 10 s and then wash with milliQ water.",
    "In a larger tray, add 1x Transfer buffer (in Materials Table) and place it in an opened gel holder cassette from a Hoefer TE22 Mini Tank Blotting Unit with its black side down. First, place a foam sponge on the cassette, then a piece of chromatography paper, followed by the polyacrylamide gel, the PVDF membrane, another piece of chromatography paper, and another sponge. Close the cassette.\nPlace loaded cassettes in transfer apparatus.\nFill the apparatus between min and max lines with 1x Transfer buffer.\nPlace the lid on the apparatus, place it in a 4°C glass front refrigerator, connect to a power source and start the transfer (run at 280 mA for 210 min) for membranes with a pore size of 0.45 μm.\nNote: We have run target proteins between 20 kDa and 280 kDa at 280 mA for 210 minutes.\nImmunoblotting (primary antibody incubated ∼16 h)\nBlocking step: Remove the PVDF membrane from cassette and place in 5% milk (10 g of powdered milk to 200 mL of 1X TBS-T (in Materials Table), pH to 7.6, and filter before use) in a tray for 1 h at 22°C on a gentle rocking apparatus.\nPour out the 5% milk solution and add primary antibodies diluted in 5% milk; rock ∼16 h at 4°C.\nNote: Position cassette so that the black side faces the back of the transfer apparatus and the gel transfers to the membrane.\nNote: Certain primary antibodies need to be diluted in BSA.\nDAY 4 – Immunolocalization protocol\nTiming: 30 min–1 h/section\nThis section describes how confocal microscopy imaging is used to examine the impact on the spatiotemporal localization of the molecules of interest after exposing lenses in organ culture to signaling pathway inhibitors.\nConfocal microscopy",
    "Using an LSM800 Zeiss Confocal Microscope, identify the lens section under low magnification (5X or 10X) and then switch to 40X magnification.\nDetermine the optical section thickness for a specific study depending on the area of interest. If the entire thickness of the section is needed, then a z-stack of the tile should be acquired.\nUsing the most brightly stained experimental condition, go through each channel and adjust the laser wavelength and detector gain (up to 800V) until the staining intensity is bright/clear without over saturating. If the range indicator shows that the staining is over saturated, decrease the laser wavelength.\nBefore acquiring the image, use the tile application in Zeiss’ confocal software (Zen), set up a tile that extends across the entire lens section. As lenses increase in size during development the number of tiles needed to acquire this image will depend on lens size.\nAfter images have been acquired, use Zen software to adjust brightness/contrast, overlay specific channels, measure staining intensity, and create orthogonal projections, among other options.\nNote: For our studies, we adjust the settings to acquire an image using an optical section thickness of 0.7 μm.\nNote: Acquiring a 10 × 10 tile using three different channels at a scan speed of 7 takes about 20 minutes.\nNote: If the tissue section is not flat, add support points where needed and the software will provide a cohesive and smooth image.\nNote: While we are using an LSM800 Zeiss Confocal Microscope, any microscope and its accompanying software may be used. A confocal microscope is able to image a single optical plane but other types of microscopes can be used to image immunolabeled tissue sections.\nDAY 4 – Immunoblotting protocol\nTiming: 3–4 h",
    "Here is described the final steps of the standard immunoblotting protocol that allows visualization and quantification of the proteins of interest.\nWestern blot (continued)\nWash the PVDF membrane with TBS-T for 30 min at 22°C.\nAdd secondary antibody tagged with HRP diluted in 5% milk and incubate for 2 h at 22°C.\nWash the membrane with TBS-T for 30 min at 22°C.\nIncubate the membrane in ECL plus for 5 min.\nDetect bands using a FluorChem E&M imager."
