  "procedures": [
    "All human samples utilized in this protocol have been obtained with informed consent and have been approved by the Internal Review Board (IRB) at Columbia University and Yale University.\nNOTE: The entirety of this protocol should follow strict RNA handling guidelines, whereby a gloved hand is always used, all surfaces are cleaned with an RNase decontaminator and all working materials are RNA/DNA/Nuclease free.\n1. Test RNA Integrity of Tissue prior to Starting LCM\nNOTE: Testing RNA quality can be done by many methods. Ensure that RNA from the entire section is tested to provide a representative RNA integrity number (RIN) for the sample.\nCarefully select tissue samples for inclusion that fit within the parameter of the experimental design. If cutting at the cryostat, move to Step 1.2. If not, process the tissue accordingly and move to Step 1.11.\nGet two containers of dry ice. The size will depend on the number of samples.\nIn the first container of dry ice, place an empty, labeled 2 mL tube with the tissue code.\nNOTE: It takes 10 min for the tubes to freeze. Tubes must be frozen prior to placing the tissue into them; otherwise, the tissue will melt on the tube surface.\nIn a second container of dry ice, place the tissue from a -80 °C freezer that requires RNA check.\nClean the cryostat. See Step 4.7 for detailed cleaning procedure.\nRemove the tissue from dry ice and cut a small section of tissue with a RNase decontaminated razor blade. Tissue should be approximately 1 cm x 1 cm in size.",
    "Place an approximately 3 mm high mound of optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound on a cryostat 'chuck' and allow it to partially freeze. Then, place the tissue on top of the OCT — do not push into OCT, simply allow it to rest on top.\nOnce OCT hardens, place the chuck with the mounted tissue in the cryostat cutting arm and position in front of the cryostat blade.\nTrim at 30 μm sections until the tissue is even.\nCut 300 μm of the tissue and place in a frozen 2 mL tube. Place the tube back into dry ice.\nRemove the tissue from the 'chuck' and place back into dry ice until ready to put away.\nRepeat Steps 1.4–1.9 for all tissues.\nOnce all samples are complete, extract RNA using the RNA extraction kit provided (Table of Materials #15). A detailed protocol is provided with the RNA extraction kit. Follow all instructions including the optional step to dry the collection tube membrane and the optional step for DNase digestion (Table of Materials #16).\nTest the integrity of extracted RNA via a quality assessment bioanalyzer14.\n2. Prepare prior to Starting Sectioning for LCM\nClean the slides holders prior to each round of tissue sectioning for LCM. Perform the cleaning procedure the day before use to allow complete drying overnight.\n\tNOTE: Slide holders are used for tissue section fixation in ethanol and clearing in xylene.\n\t\nSlide holder cleaning procedure: Rinse with RNase decontaminator followed by diethyl pyrocarbonate treated (DEPC) water. Allow to dry overnight upside down on an RNA/DNA/Nuclease free surface, avoiding any dust or other airborne contamination.\nCAUTION: DEPC is highly toxic and should be handled and disposed of using EH&S standard hazardous chemicals protocol.",
    "Clean the brushes for sectioning with RNase decontaminator and allow to dry overnight. Avoid any dust and other contaminants.\nPlace the membrane slides under UV light for 30 min at room temperature. Do not expose the slides to UV more than 1–2 days prior to use. This enhances the binding of the tissue to the membrane slide.\nNOTE: Step 2.3 can be combined with Step 4, which allows for slide UV treatment to occur on the same day as tissue sectioning (see Step 4.4).\n3. Prepare Fixation Solutions with RNase Free Water and High-Quality Ethanol\nNOTE: All solutions are prepared fresh for every experiment. Ensure that the slide holder cleaning procedure from Step 1.1 is completed. All solutions are prepared in slide holders.\nPlace 30 mL of 100% ethanol in one slide holder.\nDilute ethanol with RNase/DNase/Nuclease free water. Place 30 mL of 95% ethanol in one slide holder and put on ice.\nDilute ethanol with RNase/DNase/Nuclease free water. Place 30 mL of 70% ethanol in one slide holder and put on ice.\nPlace 30 mL of 100% xylene in two separate slide holders and label them as #1 and #2.\n4. Prepare Cryostat for Tissue Sectioning\nGet a bucket of ice for ethanol solutions and a container with dry ice for the tissue.\nCAUTION: Dry ice is extremely cold, so use protective gloves. Do not place ice and dry ice in the same container. Differing temperatures in the ice and dry ice will cause them to form together at an indeterminate temperature.\nRemove the tissue from the -80 °C freezer and place on dry ice for transport to the cryostat.\nCryostat settings:\nSet the section thickness to 14 μm.\nSet the trim thickness to 30 μm to preserve tissue quantity.",
    "For cryostats with dual chamber and specimen holding temperatures, set the chamber temperature (CT) to -18 °C. For cryostats with one setting, set the temperature to -17 °C.\nFor cryostats with dual chamber and specimen holding temperature, set the object temperature (OT) to -16 °C.\nNOTE: The OT needs to be warmer than the CT to ensure even cutting. If the tissue is still shredding, the OT can be increased to -15 °C and the CT can be increased to -18 °C.\nPlace the tissue in the cryostat for at least 20 min to allow to come to optimal temperature.\nNOTE: If the tissue is not at optimal temperature, it will shred upon cutting. Do not place the tissue in -20 °C the night before to preserve RNA integrity and to prevent ice crystal formation. Allow the tissue as much time as necessary to equilibrate to optimal temperature to cut smoothly. Optional implementation of slide incubation under UV may occur here (see Step 1.3).\nPlace the 'chuck' in the cryostat for at least 20 min to allow to come down to the temperature of the cryostat.\nPlace the clean brushes in the cryostat for at least 20 min to allow to come down to the temperature of the cryostat.\nClean the cryostat\nClean the stage with a 1:1 mixture of RNase decontaminator and 70% ethanol diluted with RNA/DNA/Nuclease free water to prevent freezing on stage.\nClean a new disposable cryostat blade with RNase decontaminator and place in the blade holder on the stage. Allow at least 20 min for the cryostat blade to come to the temperature of the cryostat.\nClean the anti-roll plate with RNase decontaminator and attach to the stage. Allow at least 20 min for the anti-roll plate to come to the temperature of the cryostat.",
    "NOTE: An anti-roll plate is not required for cutting but is highly recommended. If an anti-roll plate is not available, a cleaned brush works as an alternative. If the anti-roll plate is not at the correct temperature, the tissue will melt or stick upon cutting.\n5. Sectioning Tissue\nCut a small piece of the tissue (~1 cm x 1 cm) for sectioning. Return the remaining tissue to dry ice/-80 °C freezer.\nNOTE: Ensure that the tissue section is ~95% cerebellar cortex, where Purkinje cells are located.\nPlace an approximately 3 mm high mound of OCT to cover the 'chuck'. Start by building the layers on top in a slow, circular motion, until there is a small mound.\nOnce OCT is partially frozen, but there is still some liquid in the center, place the tissue on top of OCT. Do not push the tissue deeply into OCT. Allow the tissue to sit on top of OCT until completely frozen. This will take 1–2 min.\nPlace the 'chuck' with frozen OCT and the tissue into the cryostat cutting arm. Adjust the tissue so it is flush with cutting blade.\nAllow the tissue to sit in the cutting arm for 15–20 min to adjust to new temperature.\nNOTE: Depending on the thickness of the tissue, time is needed for temperature acclimation. Allow the tissue to sit as long as required to cut cleanly. Adjust OT and CT to assist with tissue temperature acclimation.\nSlowly move the tissue closer to the blade. Once the tissue has reached the blade, start the trim process. Trim thickness should be set to 30 μm.\nTrim 2–3x until the cortex layers are visible.\nPlace and align the anti-roll plate just above the cryostat blade.",
    "NOTE: A silver line will appear from the light in the cryostat at the interface of the blade and anti-roll plate. This indicates the anti-roll plate is directly over the edge of the blade.\nBegin to cut the sections at 14 μm. Properly cut sections will be flat under the anti-roll plate.\nNOTE: If the tissue is stuck, ensure that the anti-roll plate is cold enough. If necessary, placing a piece of dry ice on the outside (side not touching the stage) will rapidly chill the anti-roll plate.\nCut 4–6 sections and align them horizontally across the cryostat stage.\nAngling the slide, pick up all pieces of the tissue at one time.\nNOTE: Using the brushes, lift up the ends of the tissue to be more readily available for the slide upon pick up. Do not pick up one section at a time. Exposure to room temperature air will degrade RNA integrity.\nCAUTION: Do not let the membrane touch the stage of the cryostat. If the membrane touches the stage, it will begin to detach from the glass slide and will cause errors when attempting LCM.\nImmediately move to Step 6. Do not delay fixation.\n6. Fixing Tissue/Stain-less Visualization\nImmediately move to the ethanol fixation protocol\nPlace the slide in the slide holder with 70% ethanol for 2 min — on ice.\nPlace the slide in the slide holder with 95% ethanol for 45 s — on ice.\nPlace the slide in the slide holder with 100% ethanol for 2 min — at RT.\nDip the slide 3 times in the slide holder with xylene 1 — at RT.\nPlace the slide in the slide holder with xylene 2 for 5 min — at RT.",
    "Allow to dry in a clean area for at least 30 min. Longer dry times are optimal, up to 60 min.\nCAUTION: Stand up slides for drying in a fume hood. Xylene is volatile. Laying slides flat will cause xylene to pool in the tissue section, which will cause tissue to be too dark.\n7. Optional — Slide Storage\nPlace dried slides in individual 50 mL tubes (one slide per tube) and place in the -80 °C freezer for up to 7 days.\nNOTE: Slides must be dry prior to placing in the -80 °C freezer. Do not use desiccant inside the tube as particulates will embed in the tissue and membrane. Ensure that the tube cap is tight; if not, condensation will occur on the slide when thawing for use.\nCAUTION: RNA integrity decreases after 7 days, as does the quality of tissue visualization.\n8. Thawing Stored Slides for Use\nRemove the tube with a single slide from the -80 °C freezer 1 h prior to intended use.\nDo not immediately open the tube. Allow the tube to come to room temperature. Condensation will occur on the outside of the tube only.\nOnce the tube has come to room temperature and all condensation is gone (approximately 30–40 min), remove the cap and expose the slide to the room temperature air.\nAllow the slide to acclimate to room temperature for 15–20 min. Leave the slide inside the tube with the cap removed.\nNOTE: Slide is now ready for LCM.\n9. Laser Capture Microdissection of Purkinje Cells:\nNOTE: This section of the protocol will only discuss specifics related to capturing Purkinje cells for subsequent RNA sequencing. This section assumes that the user is familiar with the UV laser capture microscope and the affiliated software.",
    "Clean the microscope stage and the cap collection arm with RNase decontaminator.\nWith gloved hands, place the slide on the microscope and 500 μL opaque cap in the collection arm.\nNOTE: Always ensure proper RNA technique by cleaning the work area with RNase decontaminator and use gloved hands while touching the slide or opaque cap. Gloves can be removed once the slide and cap are in place and laser capture has commenced.\nAt low magnification, align the opaque cap over the cerebellar tissue, ensuring that the cap covers the entire area visualized in the eye piece.\nNOTE: Only the eye piece of the microscope will show if the opaque cap is centered. The camera will not show if the cap is centered over the tissue. Depending on the laser capture scope design, the visualization through the opaque cap will either be in the eye piece only or visualized in both the eye piece and camera.\nVisualize the cerebellar layers with 5x - 10x objective lens and place the cursor over the section where molecular layer and granule cell layer intersect (the Purkinje cell layer).\nMove to 40X and visualize Purkinje cells.\nNOTE: See Figure 1 and Figure 2 for example visualizations.\nBegin capturing Purkinje cells.\nNOTE: To perform RNA-sequencing, at least 5 ng of RNA is required. Approximately 1600–2000 Purkinje cells result in enough RNA material for sequencing. RNA will be stable for up to 8 h at the microscope. Test UV energy and UV focus prior to collection to ensure levels are correct. Over time, the tissue will continue to dry out and the UV energy and UV focus may need to be changed.\n10. RNA Collection post LCM\nPrepare the cell lysis buffer (prepare fresh each time)",
    "Dilute 2-mercaptoethanol in lysis buffer at 1:100 (10 μL:1 mL, respectively). Lysis (RLT) buffer is provided in Table of Materials (#14 and #15).\nAdd 50 μL of cell lysis buffer to the opaque cap, with the cap facing up. Carefully close the tube over the cap.\nLeave the tube upside down for 1 min.\nVortex the tube for 30 s and quickly spin the lysis buffer to the bottom of the tube.\nReopen the tube and repeat Steps 10.2–10.4.\nPlace the tube containing 100 μL of lysis buffer and RNA from the -80 °C freezer until all samples are finished and ready for RNA extraction (Table of Materials #14).\nSubscription Required.
