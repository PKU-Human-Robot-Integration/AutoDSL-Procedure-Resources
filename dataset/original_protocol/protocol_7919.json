    "All procedures were carried out in accordance with the European directive 2010/63/EU and were approved by Malmö-Lund Ethical committee on Animal Research (Dnr 5.8.18-05527/2019) and conducted according to the CODEX guidelines of the Swedish Research Council.\n1. Preparation\nTracer\n\t\nPrepare artificial CSF (126 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, 10 mM glucose, 26 mM NaHCO3; pH 7.4)\nTo 500 μL of artificial CSF, add 10 mg of albumin from bovine serum (BSA) conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 (BSA-647).\nCentrifuge at 5,000 x g for 5 min and use the supernatant.\nCannula\n\t\nAttach a 1 mL syringe to the female Luer connection of the intravenous (IV) line, 3-ways tap with 10 cm extension.\nAttach an 18 G needle to the male end.\nOpen the 3-way stop lock to allow for continuity from the needle to the syringe.\nCarefully unsheathe the needle and aspirate approximately 300 μL of the saline into the IV line.\nRemove the needle from the saline and proceed to introduce in some air to create a small air bubble (5-10 mm) in the IV line.\nPlace the needle into the tracer and aspirate all 500 μL of the tracer. The saline in the IV line should be visibly separated by an air bubble.\nDiscard the needle and close the 3-way stop lock.\nAnimal\n\t\nSedate a pig by intramuscular (i.m.) injection of tiletamine (3.75 mg/kg) and zolazepam (3.75 mg/kg) and dexmedetomidine (37.5 μg/kg). Wait for it to become unconscious.\nPrepare an intravenous line by inserting a 20 G cannula into the ear vein.\n\t\t​NOTE: Make sure the cannula is in the vein by injecting 5-10 mL of saline through the cannula. If the vein has been missed, this will be noticeable by small edema in the ear tissue.",
    "Intubate the pig to ensure that the breathing rate can be regulated throughout the surgery.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure successful intubation by applying pressure on the pig's thorax and confirm that forcibly expired air is coming out of the intubation tube.\nAttach the intubation tube to a ventilator set to a breath rate of 14 breaths/min.\nConnect a pulse oximeter and cuff to the tail to monitor the heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and oxygen saturation (sats). Insert a rectal thermometer to monitor the core temperature.\nPrepare an IV bag of ketamine (5 mg/kg/min), midazolam (0.25 mg/kg/min), and fentanyl (2.5 μg/kg/min), in saline and begin to infuse through the ear vein at approximately 2 drops/s.\n\t\tNOTE: Throughout the surgery, the infusion rate may need to be increased or decreased based on the animal's vitals.\nWith the pig in the prone position, palpate the back of the head and neck of the animal to locate and mark the occipital crest and spine of the first thoracic vertebrae and the base of each ear.\nDraw a straight line between the crest and the vertebrae along the longitudinal axis. Draw two lines from the crest to the base of each ear by following the base of the skull (Figure 1A).\nCheck that the animal is in a deep sleep by carefully clamping the tail and watching for the absence of a tail reflex.\n\t\t​NOTE: If the animal is still reflexive, the anesthetic infusion rate should be incrementally increased until the animal no longer exhibits a reflex.\n2. Surgery\nNOTE: All through the surgery, it is necessary to have at least one assistant to suction the light bleeding and cauterize any severed vessels.\nUsing a scalpel with a # 21 blade, make a dermal incision along the longitudinal line down to the muscle.",
    "Extend two perpendicular dermal incisions further along the shoulders, 10-15 cm in length.\nFrom the occipital crests, make dermal incisions along the line down to the base of each ear.\nGripping the skin corners formed at the occipital crest with anatomical forceps, carefully separate the skin from the underlying muscle by lightly running the scalpel blade over the fascia, moving from the rostral to caudal. Once the skin has been resected following each of the five incisions, parts of the trapezius muscles should then be visible.\nMake a longitudinal incision with the scalpel, approximately 1 cm deep, where the trapezius comes together at the midline.\n\tNOTE: When cutting through the muscles, there is an increased propensity for bleeding, so the cauterizer should be ready. If a larger vessel is severed, one person should quickly compress it with the gauze, while the other person uses the cauterizer.\nUsing a combination of straight and curved surgical forceps, perform blunt dissection working along the longitudinal cut in the muscles. This will separate the bellies of the trapezius, as well as the underlying semispinalis capitus biventer muscle.\nSever any persisting muscle fibers with a scalpel and continue blunt dissection until semispinalis capitus complexus becomes visible.\nSever the origins of the trapezius and semispinalis capitus biventer muscles along the posterior aspect of the skull. Carefully separate them longitudinally with the scalpel performing blunt dissection until the semispinalis capitus complexus is fully visible.\nRetract the trapezius and semispinalis capitus biventer muscles using self-retaining retractors.\nWhere the bellies of the semispinalis capitus complexus come together in the midline, make a longitudinal incision with the scalpel approximately 1 cm deep.\n\tNOTE: Be aware for any additional bleeding here. Bleeding can be managed using a combination of cotton swabs and cauterization.",
    "Using surgical forceps, perform a blunt dissection working along the longitudinal cut between the muscle bellies until the dorsal aspect of the atlas (CI) is palpable.\nSever the origins of the semispinalis capitus complexus muscles along the posterior aspect of the skull and separate it longitudinally from the underlying vertebrae by scalpel and blunt dissection.\nRetract the semispinalis capitus complexus muscles using another set of self-retaining retractors.\nUsing a scalpel, carefully remove any remaining tissue overlying the region where the atlas meets the skull base.\nPlacing one arm under the animal's neck and one finger at the juncture of the atlas and skull, simultaneously elevate the head and flex the neck while palpating with the finger to reveal the cisterna magna using the other hand.\n\t​NOTE: The cisterna magna is recognizable when palpating as a strong elastic structure with a small amount of rebound as pressure is released with the finger.\n3. Cannulation and injection\nNOTE: This step also requires at least two people and is carried out with the animal's head elevated and neck flexed.\nEnsure that one person elevates and flexes the head and neck of the animal whilst the other palpates for the cisterna magna making a note of its anatomical location.\nSlowly and carefully introduce a 22 G cannula through the dura and into the cisterna magna at an oblique angle to the longitudinal axis.",
    "NOTE: Do not insert the cannula too deep, as this can cause damage to the brain. Knowing how far to insert the cannula comes with experience in understanding how it feels for the cannula to pierce the dura. Essentially, just as the dura has been pierced, the cannula is then deep enough for a successful tracer injection. This depth is approximately 3-5 mm but will differ based on the size or age of the animal. Successful cannulation should be immediately evident through the visualization of clear, pulsatile CSF ascending the cannula. For the best outcome, it is recommended to practice several cannulations beforehand in euthanized animals to get one's understanding of dural piercing.\nRetract the needle from the cannula and place a cap on the lock.\nFirst, apply superglue and an accelerator where the cannula enters the tissue, followed by the application of the dental cement. Wait for 5 min for the cement to harden.\nCarefully remove the cap from the cannula and attach the male end of the previously prepared IV line tap with 10 cm extension, with the tracer, to the cannula.\nSlowly inject the tracer by hand or using a micro-infusion pump at a rate of 100 μL/min. Remove the 3-ways IV line tap with 10 cm extension and replace it with the cap. Tracer should now be visible pulsating at the base of the cannula (Supplementary Video 1).\n\tNOTE: If injecting by hand, do this until the tracer is just still visible in the cannula shaft, approximately 1-2 mm above where the dental cement is covering the shaft.\nFollowing injection, place sandbags under the neck to maintain some flexion. The head may then be released, and the animal is left in a resting prone position.",
    "Release the self-retaining retractors and place muscles as they lay before. Bring the skin together over the muscles using surgical towel clamps.\nCover towel clamps and incision with gauze and then a blanket to limit heat loss.\nAllow the tracer to circulate for the desired time before euthanizing the animal by i.v. Pentobarbital injection (140 mg/kg). Confirm euthanasia by the absence of heart sounds upon auscultation with a stethoscope.\n4. Brain extraction and processing\nUsing a scalpel with 20-blade, extend the longitudinal dermal incision from the occipital crest to approximately 7 cm above the nose.\nReflect the skin overlying the dorsal aspect of the skull using the scalpel.\n\tNOTE: There are several ways to cut and remove the dorsal aspect of the pig skull on an animal-by-animal basis. What follows is the procedure that has worked most often for this experiment.\nUsing a handheld compact saw, make a coronal cut in the skull, approximately 3 cm above the two large veins seen exiting the skull. Extend to two further vertical cuts from the coronal cuts and two more further cuts to bring the vertical cuts together in the midline.\n\tNOTE: Maintain a firm grip of the saw when making the skull bone cuts as it will tend to pull away upon the first contact with the bone or tissue, which can lead to a severe injury.\nEnsure the skull cuts are through the entire thickness of the bone by following up with a hammer and narrow chisel (10 mm) to each of the cuts.\nUsing the hammer, finally knock a wide chisel (25-30 mm) into the coronal cut. With one person supporting the head, ensure that the other person applies leverage on the chisel to wince open the dorsal skull.",
    "Once the dorsal skull fragment has been removed, dissect out the overlying dura mater using curved surgical scissors.\nUse a spatula to severe the spinal cord from the cerebellum at the rostral aspect. Then proceed to guide the spatula under the brain from the front, severing the olfactory bulbs, pituitary gland, and cranial nerves.\nPlace the spatula behind the cerebellum and apply a fair amount of pressure to dislodge the brain from the cranial cavity, carefully lifting it out once loose.\nImmediately fix the whole brain by tissue immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight.\n\tNOTE: After this step, it is possible to carry out the whole brain imaging using a stereoscope (Figure 1E).\nThe next day, make coronal slices of the brain using a salmon knife and fix the slices overnight by tissue immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde.\nFinally, place the slices in 0.01% azide in PBS for long-term storage.\nSubscription Required.
