    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\ntRNA Preparation\nHere we present two different methods for tRNA preparation. The first method involves in vitro transcription by T7 RNAP, which efficiently synthesizes the tRNA of interest as a transcript, but lacking all natural post-transcriptional modifications (Hall et al., 1989[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Sampson and Uhlenbeck, 1988[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Samuelsson et al., 1988[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). It allows to produce micrograms of an individual tRNA (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], left lane, for an example). The second method involves the expression of the tRNA of interest in bacteria and isolation of total tRNA mixture enriched for the expressed tRNA (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], right lane, for an example). This method produces milligrams of total tRNA mixture, containing a major proportion of the overexpressed tRNA (an estimated 40%–50%). While this purity is sufficient for many applications, the in vitro transcribed tRNA should be used in cases where the use of highly homogeneous tRNA preparation is important, regardless of the post-transcriptional modifications. Both preparations work well in the case of arginylation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/317-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. tRNAArg Preparations Obtained by the Methods Described in Steps 1–30\n300 ng of RNA samples was separated on 12% PAGE/7.5 M urea.\nIn Vitro Transcription of Mouse tRNAArg\nTiming: 2–3 days\nTo anneal the two single-stranded tDNA oligonucleotides, mix the following: 10 μL of the forward oligonucleotide (100 μM), 10 μL of the reverse oligonucleotide (100 μM), 4 μL of 200 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 16 μL of nuclease-free water.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_317_3.csv\nUnfold the oligonucleotides by heating for 2 min at 95°C and anneal the overlapping oligonucleotides for 3 min at 20°C–22°C.",
    "To fill-in the 5′ overhangs and form blunt ends, combine the following, in this order: 20 μL of 10× buffer (NEB Buffer 2), 6.6 μL of 1 mM dNTP mix, 4 μL of DNA polymerase I, Large (Klenow) Fragment (5 U/μL), 129.4 μL of nuclease-free water and 40 μL of the tDNA oligonucleotide mix (from step 1).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_317_4.csv\nIncubate for 15 min at 25°C.\nAdd 1 volume of the crush and soak buffer (50 mM potassium acetate (KOAc), 200 mM KCl, pH 7.5) and 2 volumes of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). Vortex 30 s and centrifuge at 21,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nPrecipitate the aqueous phase with 2.7 volumes of ethanol (100%). Incubate for 30 min at −80°C, followed by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C.\nAir dry the pellet for 5–10 min at 20°C–22°C. Dissolve it into 50 μL of nuclease-free water. Determine the concentration by Nanodrop, and the integrity by 2% agarose gel. Store the synthesized double-stranded DNA template of the tRNA at −20°C.\nFor in vitro transcription of the tRNA, use Megashortscript Kit with 1 μg of the double-stranded template DNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/AM1354[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/AM1354]). Incubate for 16 h at 37°C.\nCritical: The reagents, chemicals, tips, and tubes should be RNase-free. All buffers should be prepared with DEPC-treated water in RNase-free conditions. Reused plastics or glassware should be washed with RNaseZap followed by pure water.\nTo digest the DNA template, add 1 μL of TURBO DNase provided by Megashortscript Kit to the reaction and mix well. Incubate at 37°C for 15 min.",
    "Separate the transcription reaction using 12% PAGE/7.5 M urea. The dimension of the gel should be 14 by 14 by 0.1 cm. Visualize the synthesized tRNA transcript by Sybr Gold under UV light and excise the tRNA band. Place the excised gel pieces into a 0.2 mL tube with holes at the bottom. Holes can be made by a needle. Put the 0.2 mL tube into 1.5 mL tube and centrifuge at 16,100 × g for 1 min at 20°C–22°C. Remove the 0.2 ml tube. Add 2 volumes of crush and soak buffer (50 mM KOAc, 200 mM KCl, pH 7.5) to the gel pieces and elute tRNA transcript by shaking the tube on a rotator for 16 h at 4°C.\nNote: tRNAs can be cleaned by Monarch RNA Cleanup Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.neb.com/protocols/2018/06/28/monarch-rna-cleanup-kit-protocol[href=https://www.neb.com/protocols/2018/06/28/monarch-rna-cleanup-kit-protocol]). It should be noted that T7 RNAP tends to add one or more nontemplated nucleotides at the 3′ terminus of the transcribed RNA (Krupp, 1988[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Milligan et al., 1987[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). Recovering tRNA from a gel effectively removes these longer tRNA transcripts, although it is more time-consuming with a reduction in the yield. To enhance the rate of the correct size transcribed tRNA in the reaction, modified DNA template with methoxy moieties at the ribose C2′ position of the penultimate nucleotide of the complementary strand could be used (Kao et al., 1999[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nTo separate the gel pieces from the buffer containing transcribed tRNA, filter the sample through a 0.22 μm syringe filter. Add 1 volume of isopropanol and precipitate tRNA for 30 min at −80°C.\nPellet tRNA by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. Wash the tRNA pellet with 70% ethanol twice. Dissolve it into DEPC-treated water. Determine the concentration by Nanodrop. The A260/A280 ratio should be ≥ 2.",
    "To ensure correct tRNA folding, unfold the tRNA for 2 min at 95°C, followed by 3 min at 20°C–22°C. Place the sample for further 5 min at 37°C. Store it at −80°C.\nNote: (1) Step 13 should be performed only once. The tRNA sample should be aliquoted and stored at −80°C to prevent damage during multiple freeze/thaw cycles. (2) Since divalent cations, especially Mg2+, are very effective at stabilizing the tertiary structures of most RNAs (Hall et al., 1989[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Klein et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Serebrov et al., 1998[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]), addition of Mg2+ at step 13 may promote the stability of the correct conformation of tRNA.\nPreparation of an Enriched tRNAArg Fraction by E. coli Expression\nTiming: 4–5 days\nThis procedure involves expression of a tRNA-encoding plasmid in E. coli, followed by isolation of total tRNA. The resulting total E. coli tRNA mixture is greatly enriched for the expressed tRNA (tRNAArg in the case of arginylation, which constitutes an estimated 40%–50% of the total tRNA in the preparation). Aminoacylation of this mixture with purified arginyl-tRNA synthetase (RARS) can be used to estimate the exact fraction of tRNAArg in the mixture. This procedure, described below, yields an enriched preparation of tRNAArg which is suitable for arginylation reaction regardless of the presence of other tRNA species. Because of its high yield compared to in vitro transcription, this preparation is recommended for routine arginylation experiments.\nWe generate an expression plasmid for tRNAArg in the pKK223-3 vector, driven by the strong pTac promoter. Transform E. coli JM109 cells with the plasmid that harbors E. coli tRNAArgACG following the manufacturer’s protocol for E. coli JM109 transformation (https://www.promega.com/products/cloning-and-dna-markers/bacterial-strains-and-competent-cells/pro-5_alpha_-jm109-and-hb101-competent-cells/?catNum=L2005[href=https://www.promega.com/products/cloning-and-dna-markers/bacterial-strains-and-competent-cells/pro-5_alpha_-jm109-and-hb101-competent-cells/?catNum=L2005]).",
    "Select transformants for the presence of ampicillin-resistance marker by plating the bacteria on Luria broth (LB) agar plates containing 100 μg/mL of ampicillin. Pick a single colony and grow it into 20 mL of LB containing 100 μg/mL of ampicillin for 16 h as the pre-culture.\nDilute the pre-culture 1:100 into 1 L LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin.\nContinually grow the culture with shaking at 37°C until OD600 reaches 0.4–0.6.\nInduce tRNAArgACG expression by adding 0.3 mM IPTG. Incubate on a shaker for approximately 10 h at 37°C.\nNote: If the tRNA of interest is eukaryotic, it should be noted that expression of a eukaryotic tRNA in E. coli generates the post-transcriptional modifications provided by E. coli enzymes, which may not reproduce those found in a eukaryotic host.\nCollect the cells by centrifuging at 5,000 × g for 25 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet into 30 mL of 0.9% NaCl.\nCollect the cells by centrifuging at 5,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant.\nOptional: Weight the pellet. Typical yield is 3.5–5 g of wet cells for 1 L of culture.\nFirst Extraction: Resuspend the pellet into 18 mL of 50 mM sodium acetate (NaOAc), 10 mM MgOAc, pH 5.0 and add 17.2 mL of commercial acidic phenol, pH 4.5. Transfer the emulsion into a 125 mL flask and shake it at 215 rpm for 30 min at 20°C–37°C. Centrifuge at 5,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Collect the upper aqueous phase by gentle aspiration with a pipette and transfer it to a new tube. Be careful not to take any of the interface.",
    "Critical: The reagents, chemicals, tips, and tubes should be RNase-free. All buffers should be prepared with DEPC-treated water in RNase-free conditions. Reused plastics or glassware should be washed with RNaseZap followed by pure water.\nSecond Extraction: Add 14 mL of 50 mM NaOAc, 10 mM MgOAc, pH 5.0 to phenol/interphase, and transfer back into the 125 mL flask. Shake it for 15 min as described in step 22. Repeat the centrifugation and recovery of the aqueous phase. Combine aqueous phases (approx. 36 mL).\nPrecipitation of total nucleic acids: Add 1.5 mL of 5 M NaCl to the aqueous phases collected in steps 22 and 23 to the final concentration of 0.2 M NaCl. Add 1 volume of isopropanol. Store briefly at 20°C–22°C and centrifuge at 14,500 × g for 15 min at 20°C–22°C. Wash the nucleic acid pellet with cold 70% ethanol, and air dry for 5–10 min.\nRemoval of rRNA by precipitation (needed because at this step the preparation contains ribosomal RNA): Resuspend the pellet into 10 mL of cold 1 M NaCl by vortexing and/or pipetting. This process is facilitated by letting the pellet hydrate in 1 M NaCl prior to resuspension. Centrifuge the sample at 9,500 × g for 20 min at 4°C. Collect the supernatant. Resuspend the pellet into 5 mL of cold 1 M NaCl and centrifuge it again at 9,500 × g for 20 min at 4°C. Collect the supernatant and combine it with the first supernatant (total 15 mL).\nOptional: The second extraction is optional. The pellet can be resuspended into 15 mL of cold 1 M NaCl.",
    "Precipitation of remaining nucleic acids (including DNA and tRNA): Add 30 mL (2 volumes) of cold ethanol to the supernatant collected in step 25. Incubate for 30 min at −20°C. Centrifuge at 14,500 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Wash the pellet with 70% ethanol and air dry for 5–10 min.\nRemoval of DNA by precipitation: Dissolve the pellet into 6 mL of 0.3 M NaOAc, pH 5.0. This may require heating and swirling at 60°C along with pipetting. Add 3.4 mL of isopropanol (0.56 volume) to the nucleic acid solution and incubate it for 10 min at 20°C–22°C. Centrifuge at 14,500 × g for 5 min at 20°C–22°C. Collect the supernatant.\nNote: (1) Dispersion is easier if the pellet is in the NaOAc buffer up to 16 h. (2) If the yield is low, the pellets from multiple 1-liter cultures can be pooled into 6 mL of 0.3 M NaOAc pH 5.0.\nFinal precipitation of tRNAs: Add 2.3 mL of isopropanol to the supernatant (water:isopropanol is 1.00:0.95) and incubate it for 30 min at −20°C. Centrifuge the suspension at 14,500 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The pellet should appear white. Wash the pellet with 70% ethanol and air dry for 5–10 min. Dissolve the pellet into 500 μL of DEPC-treated water. Do not over-dry the pellet. Over-dried pellet looks transparent, but not white.",
    "Deacylation: Add 35 μL of 1.5 M Tris pH 9.0 and incubate it for 45 min at 37°C. Add 53.5 μL (0.1 volume) of 3 M NaOAc, pH 5.0 and add 1.6 mL (2.7 volumes) of ethanol (100%). Incubate for 30 min at −80°C. Centrifuge the suspension at 16,100 × g for 25 min at 4°C. Wash the pellet with 70% ethanol and air dry. Dissolve the pellet into 250–300 μL of DEPC-treated water.\nQuantification: Determine the concentration by Nanodrop. The A260/A280 ratio should be ≥ 2. Typical yield of total tRNA is 5–20 mg. The tRNA sample at this stage should be aliquoted and stored at −80°C to prevent damage during multiple freeze/thaw cycles.\nAminoacylation of tRNAArg\nTiming: 3–4 h\nThis procedure is performed similarly for both the in vitro transcribed tRNAArg and the bacterially expressed preparation enriched in tRNAArg. Since the enzyme used in this reaction (RARS) is specific to tRNAArg, the charging should be independent of the presence of other tRNA species in the mix; however, the expected yield of the charged tRNAArg species would depend on the amount of tRNAArg. Thus, the procedure below does not distinguish between the tRNA prepared by these two methods, which are referred to, in both cases, as tRNAArg.\nNote: In our experience, while the in vitro transcribed tRNA needs to be refolded prior to charging with RARS, the tRNA preparation from E. coli is already folded correctly, thus we do not use a refolding step with this preparation, and have encountered no problems with RARS charging or arginylation.",
    "Prepare a 150 μL reaction by mixing the following: 5.67 μL of tRNAArg (5,200 ng/μL; 211.6 μM; 8 μM final concentration), 4.95 μL of ATP (100 mM; 3.3 mM final concentration), 115 μL of L-[2,3,4-3H]-Arg (18.3 μM; 14 μM final concentration), 9.38 μL of purified human arginyl-tRNA synthetase (RARS) (1,800 μg/mL; 24 μM; 1.5 μM final concentration), 15 μL of 10× buffer (500 mM HEPES, 250 mM KCl, 150 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.5). At the same time, set up the control reaction containing above components, but no RARS.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_317_5.csv\nCritical: Since the protocol requires to use a radioactive isotope, the sample should be handled in a hot lab with a proper personal protective equipment, e.g., lab coat, goggles etc, after step 31.\nNote: (1) If cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase is not available, a mixture of cell lysates of the organism of interest, or a commercial E. coli aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase mix, can be used in its place. It is best, if possible, to use cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase mix, however, the only alternative that is currently commercially available is a mix of E. coli aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Our tests indicate that, despite considerations related to organism specificity (Liu et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]), E. coli and human aminoacyl-tRNA-synthetases work equally well with both mouse and E. coli tRNAArg (Avcilar-Kucukgoze et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Thus, the commercial alternative appears reasonable in the case of tRNAArg. (2) Purification of recombinant human RARS expressed in E. coli can be found in (Wang et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]). (3) For arginylation detection by methods other than scintillation counting, L-[14C(U)]-Arg or L- [13C, 15N]-Arg should be used in place of L-[2,3,4-3H]-Arg for autoradiography and mass spectrometry, respectively. Note that the U in L-[14C(U)]-Arg indicates that all carbons are uniformly labeled.",
    "Incubate the reaction at 37°C for 2 h. Add a total of 250 μL of a solution containing 100 mM NaOAc, 1 mM EDTA, pH 4.8 then mix it with 400 μL of freshly prepared acidic phenol/chloroform (5:1). Vortex 30 s and centrifuge at 21,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nNote: It is crucial to keep the aminoacyl-tRNAs (aa-tRNA) in acidic conditions, because the ester bond between the amino acid and the tRNA is easily hydrolyzed at the physiological pH.\nAdd 0.1 volume of 3 M NaOAc, pH 5.0 to the aqueous phase and precipitate it with 1 volume of isopropanol. Incubate the precipitation reaction for 30 min at −80°C, followed by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C.\nWash the aa-tRNA pellet with cold 70% ethanol 2–3 times. Air dry the pellet and dissolve it into 23.5 μL of 10 mM NaOAc, 1 mM EDTA, pH 4.8 to preserve the aminoacyl moiety. The final concentration of aa-tRNA is 1 μg/μL, assuming 80% recovery after phenol/chloroform extraction. The level of aminoacylation should be directly determined by scintillation counter. Typical yields of aminoacylation are 20%–30% of tRNAArg. Ideally, use a freshly prepared aa-tRNA for further steps.\nNote: Charging level of tRNA is calculated as follows: (1) Measure the cpm value of 1 μL stock L-[2,3,4-3H]-Arg. (2) Measure the cpm value of 1 μL of Arg-tRNA (1 μg/μL) at step 34. (3) Calculate the moles of L-[2,3,4-3H]-Arg for 1 μg (40.70 pmol) of Arg-tRNA. (4) Calculate the ratio of L-[2,3,4-3H]-Arg:tRNA in moles.\nNote: An example of calculating the aminoacylation level of tRNAArg:\nStock L-[2,3,4-3H]-Arg: 54.5 Ci/mmol, 1 mCi/mL (1 μCi/μL)\n1 μL of stock L-[2,3,4-3H]-Arg gives 825,008 cpm.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_317_6.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_317_7.csv\n1 μg of Arg-tRNA (40.70 pmol) contains 12 pmol of L-[2,3,4-3H]-Arg, thereby aminoacylation level is 29.5% (=12/40.70).",
    "Note: Charged tRNA at this step can be used directly in the arginylation reaction (see below, step 39). Alternatively, charged tRNA can be further processed by RNase T2 to produce Arg-charged tRNAArg-derived fragments (Arg-tRFArg) for the arginylation reaction.\nCleavage of Arg-tRNAArg by RNase T2\nTiming: 1–2 h\nSince RNase T2 generates tRF from all tRNAs and is not specific to tRNAArg, both in vitro transcribed and E. coli expressed preparations can in principle be used in this step. However, in vitro transcribed tRNA is recommended, given its purity that enables fully controlled conditions of the reaction.\nPrepare a 200 μL reaction by mixing the following: 20 μL of Arg-tRNAArg (1 μg/μL; 4 μM final concentration), 20 μL of purified recombinant form of human RNase T2 (2.4 ng/μL; 0.24 ng/μL final concentration), 50 μL of 800 mM NaOAc, pH 4.5, 200 mM NaCl and 110 μL DEPC-treated water.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_317_8.csv\nNote: It is crucial to keep the reaction in acidic conditions to preserve the aminoacyl group on the tRNA. Notably, RNase T2 used in this protocol acts better in an acidic pH (Campomenosi et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). The detailed purification protocol of recombinant human RNase T2 can be found in (Thorn et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]).\nIncubate the reaction for 30 min at 37°C. Add a total of 200 μL of a solution containing 10 mM NaOAc, 1 mM EDTA, pH 4.8 then mix the reaction with 400 μL of freshly prepared acidic phenol/chloroform (5:1). Vortex the mixture for 30 s and centrifuge at 21,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C.",
    "Note: To analyze Arg-tRNAArg-derived fragments (Arg-tRFArg) on a gel, autoradiography can be used if aminoacylation is performed with L-[14C(U)]-Arg. After incubation, mix the reaction directly with an acidic 2× RNA loading dye and separate the Arg-tRFArg from Arg-tRNAArg by an 8% acidic denaturing PAGE/7.5 M urea (8% polyacrylamide, 7.5 M urea, 0.1 M NaOAc/AcOH pH 5.0). Run the gel at 100–150 V (∼12 V/cm) in a cold room. Treat the gel with AutoFluor according to the manufacturer’s protocol (https://www.nationaldiagnostics.com/sites/default/files/autofluor_protocol0812_0.pdf[href=https://www.nationaldiagnostics.com/sites/default/files/autofluor_protocol0812_0.pdf]). Dry the gel under a vacuum for 2 h at 80°C. The gel can be exposed to X-ray films or phosphor screens. Because L-[14C(U)]-Arg is highly stable, the gel can be stored and re-exposed multiple times without decomposition of the label (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] for an example).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/317-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Timing: 2–3 h\nThis protocol utilizes Arg-tRNAArg or Arg-tRFArg prepared in the steps above, which can both serve as Arg donors for arginyltransferase ATE1. The procedure is the same regardless of the source and purity of tRNA, and thus in the protocol below we denote both the in vitro transcribed and bacterially expressed preparations as Arg-tRNAArg. Arginylation activity is analyzed by detecting the labeled L-[2,3,4-3H]-Arg, which is transferred from Arg-tRNAArg or Arg-tRFArg onto the peptide substrate by ATE1, using scintillation counting. Alternatively, arginylation can be detected by mass spectrometry; in this case L- [13C, 15N]-Arg should be used, to avoid contamination of the instrument with the radioactive label. For protein substrates, arginylation can also be detected by gel autoradiography; in this case, L-[14C(U)]-Arg is recommended, as it tends to have stronger and more stable autoradiography signal. Notably, the arginylation reaction with full-length tRNAArg can also be performed in the presence of RARS, which should provide ongoing supply of newly re-charged Arg-tRNAArg and thus may improve the efficiency of the reaction (see Wang et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]).\nPrepare a 50 μL reaction by mixing the following: 6.25 μL of Arg-tRNAArg or Arg-tRFArg (40.70 μM; 5 μM final concentration), 2.5 μL of angiotensin II (DRVYIHPF) (300 μM; 15 μM final concentration), 6.81 μL ATE1 (1,320 μg/mL; 22 μM; 3 μM final concentration), 5 μL of 10× buffer (500 mM HEPES, 250 mM KCl, 150 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.5) and 29.44 μL DEPC-treated water. In parallel, set up the negative control reaction with the above components, but no ATE1.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_317_9.csv\nNote: The detailed purification protocol of recombinant mouse ATE1 can be found in (Wang et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]).\nIncubate the reactions for 5 min at 37°C.",
    "Heat the reactions at 95°C for 15 min to terminate the reactions and hydrolyze the intact Arg-tRNAArg or Arg-tRFArg. Note that this heating step also denatures and precipitates proteins in the mixture, including the enzymes.\nKeep the tubes on ice for 20 min, then spin each at 17,000 × g for 15 min at 20°C–22°C to pellet the precipitated proteins. The peptides will remain in the supernatant at this step.\nLoad each supernatant onto a C18 spin column, pre-washed with 100% acetonitrile and water, by applying the supernatant on top of the column and centrifuging the column at 110 × g for 1 min. The peptides will bind to the column at this step. Discard the collection tube, containing free Arg not utilized in the reaction, into radioactive waste disposal.\nWash the columns with 150 μL of peptide wash buffer, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water, by centrifugation at 110 × g for 1 min into a new collection tube. Repeat the washing step one more time. Both collection tubes should be discarded as radioactive waste.\nElute the column-bound peptide from each reaction with 150 μL of peptide elution buffer, 60% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) TFA in water, by centrifugation at 110 × g for 1 min into a new collection tube. Repeat the elution step one more time.\nTransfer the eluted peptide from each reaction into a scintillation vial filled with Ecoscint scintillation solution and analyze on a liquid scintillation counter.\nCritical: For detection of arginylation by mass spectrometry, the eluate is concentrated by a Speedvac until 10–20 μL liquid remains. The concentrated arginylated peptide can be directly analyzed by MALDI-TOF or LC-MS/MS."
