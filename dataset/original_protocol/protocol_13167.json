    "Subjects provided written informed consent before participation in the study. The study was approved by the Human Ethics Committee of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.\n1. Collection of human tear fluid with Schirmer strip\nWear gloves and sanitize to avoid sample contamination.\nCheck that the inner packaging is intact, sterile, and not expired.\nBend the top of the Schirmer strip inward slightly at the 0 mm mark, as indicated near the semicircle tip of the strip (Figure 1).\nRemove the strip from the inner package by holding the end of the strip, and avoid direct contact with the sample collection area from 0 to 25 mm.\nAsk the subject to look away from the position of the strip to be placed.\nPull down the lower eyelid gently and hook the end of the strip in the lower fornix near the lateral canthus region (Figure 2). Repeat the same procedure on the other eye.\nAsk the subject to gently close the eyelids to minimize irritation.\nCollect tear fluid for about 5 min or preferably 15-20 mm tear sample was collected.\nAsk the subject to open both eyes, pull down the lower eyelid gently and remove the strips from the subject.\nInspect the hydrated length on the Schirmer strip and record the collected amount in mm.\nDry the strip with a standard, clean frame heater until the fluid is completely dry.\n\t​NOTE: Excess heating that could potentially char the filter paper should be avoided.\nInsert each dried Schirmer strip in a labeled cryotube and store it preferably in a cool, dry place in the dark until further processing.\n2. Preparation of chemicals and reagents\nLysis Buffer (5% SDS, 50 mM TEAB, pH 7.5), 20 mL",
    "Pipette 1 mL of 1 M TEAB and 80 µL of 12% phosphoric acid. Vortex and sonicate briefly to remove bubbles.

NOTE: Prepare before use and avoid light.\n0.2% formic acid, 50% acetonitrile, 10 mL\n\t\nPrepare 10 mL of 50% acetonitrile in deionized water.\nAdd 20 µL of formic acid and vortex briefly.\n0.2% formic acid solution, 10 mL\n\t\nAdd 20 µL of formic acid to 10 mL of deionized water and vortex briefly.\n0.1% formic acid solution, 10 mL\n\t\nAdd 10 µL of formic acid to 10 mL of deionized water; vortex briefly.\n3. Protein extraction in Schirmer strip\nCut and discard the front end beyond the 0 mm mark of the strip to remove potential contamination due to the contact of conjunctival tissues with clean stainless-steel scissors.\nCut the strip in 1 mm intervals into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube (Figure 3).",
    "Add 100 µL of lysis buffer to the microcentrifuge tube, and vortex at 1,000 rpm, room temperature for 1 h in a thermomixer.\nCentrifuge briefly and transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nMove the strips into 200 µL pipette tips using clean forceps. Place the tips into the same tube from step 3.4 with holder and centrifuge at room temperature at 4,000 × g for 1 min further for maximum recovery of the remaining sample on the strip.\nMeasure protein concentration using bicinchoninic acid (BCA) or compatible protein assay.\n4. Suspension-trapping sample preparation\nNormalize samples to 50 µg of protein based on the protein assay result.\nAdd 200 mM DTT in a ratio of 1:10 (v/v, DTT: sample) to a final concentration of 20 mM DTT and incubate at 95 °C for 10 min.\nCool down the protein solution to room temperature.\nAdd 400 mM IAA in a ratio of 1:10 (v/v, IAA: sample) to a final concentration of 40 mM IAA and incubate in the dark at room temperature for 10 min.\nAdd 12% aqueous phosphoric acid in a ratio of 1:10 (v/v, acid: sample) to a final concentration of 1.2% phosphoric acid and vortex briefly.\nAdd protein binding buffer in a ratio of 1:6 (v/v, sample: buffer) and vortex briefly.\n\tNOTE: In this step, colloidal protein particulate should be formed, and the solution will appear translucent if the protein amount is sufficient.\nUncap the Suspension Trapping Micro Spin Column and assemble the spin column onto a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube to collect flowthrough.\nAdd up to 200 µL of acidified protein lysate mixture into the column.\nCentrifuge the column at 4,000 × g for 20 s. Protein particulates were trapped; repeat until the samples are loaded to the column.",

Repeat 3x.\nAssemble the Suspension Trapping Micro Column onto a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 20 µL of 50mM TEAB digestion buffer containing protease at a ratio of 1:25 (w/w, trypsin: protein) onto the filter inside the spin column, avoiding bubbles and air gap between the filter and digestion solution.\nCap the Suspension Trapping Micro Spin Column to prevent evaporation.
