  "procedures": [
    "1. Transfer 500 µL of plasma into a 1.5 mL microfuge tube.\n  2. Add 5 µL thrombin \\(500U/mL) to a final concentration of 5U/mL.\n  3. Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes while mixing \\(gently flicking tube).\n  4. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 5 minutes. There should be a visible fibrin pellet at the bottom of the tube.\n  5. Transfer supernatant to new microfuge tube.\n  6. Add 125 µL of ExoQuick Exosome Precipitation Solution to the plasma and incubate for 30 minutes at 4°C.\n  7. Centrifuge ExoQuick/plasma mixture at 1,500 × g for 30 minutes at room temperature. \n  8. Aspirate supernatant. \n  9. Spin down residual ExoQuick solution by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 minutes at room temperature. \n  10. Remove all traces of fluid by aspiration, taking great care not to disturb the pellet.\n  11. Resuspend the pellet in 50 µL sterile PBS and proceed with RNA isolation using SeraMir Exosome RNA Purification Column Kit."
