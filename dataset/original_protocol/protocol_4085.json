    "Prime the system with distilled water. Precondition a GLH chip using 1-min pulses each of 100 mM HCl, 50 mM NaOH, 0.5% SDS and 10% DMSO using a flow rate of 30 µl/min in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Seal all microplates used with ProteOn sealing film.Prime the system with Running Buffer. Activate all 6 ligand channels (L1-L6) in the vertical direction using EDC and sulfo-NHS as prescribed by the manufacturer using a flow rate of 30 µl/min and a contact time of 5 min.Dilute NS5B protein in Immobilization Buffer to a concentration of 30 µg/ml and inject using a flow rate of 30 µl/min for 5 min in the vertical direction into the ligand channel(s) to obtain 5,000-10,000 RU of immobilized protein (see Notes). Leave the L1 channel open as a reference channel. When calculating the theoretical maximum response, Rmax, the activity of the protein should be taken into account. Rmax is calculated as RL * (MWA/MWL) * n, where RL is equal to the amount of ligand immobilized, MWA is the molecular weight of the analyte, MWL is the molecular weight of the ligand, and n is the number of binding sites per ligand molecule. Assuming single-site binding (i.e. n = 1), a small molecule analyte having an average molecular weight of 500 Da interacting with a surface comprised of 10,000 RU of NS5B ΔC21 (M.W.~ 64,300 Da) should yield a theoretical Rmax of ~ 78 RU (i.e. 10,000 RU x 500 Da/64,300 Da) or 39 RU if the surface is only 50% active.Deactivate all vertical channels (L1-L6) by injecting ethanolamine-HCl for 5 min at flow rate of 30 µl/min.Rotate the multi-channel module (MCM) as all subsequent injections will occur in the horizontal direction.",
    "Prime the system with Running Buffer containing 5% DMSO and also use this buffer to inject buffer three times to help stabilize the system after rotation.To account for excluded volume effects, a set of five solutions between 4.5% and 5.5% DMSO (DMSO concentration series) are injected for the software to generate a DMSO excluded volume calibration (EVC) curve. Prepare a 5.5% DMSO solution by adding 15 µl of 100% DMSO to 3,000 µl of Running Buffer with 5% DMSO, and a 4.5% DMSO solution by adding 333 µl of Running Buffer to 3,000 µl of Running Buffer with 5% DMSO. Mix the 5.5% and 4.5% DMSO solutions according to the volumes prescribed below to obtain the five different solutions. Five separate injections are performed to generate a DMSO concentration series each corresponding to the injection of one of the DMSO solutions. The software will use this series of injections to generate a DMSO calibration curve to correct for excluded volume effects.5.5% DMSO buffer 4.5% DMSO buffer1200 µl                           0 µl900 µl                        300 µl 600 µl                             600 µl300 µl                              900 µl 0 µl                                1200 µlWhen designing the analyte injection sequence, include buffer injections between every injection of compound (or as space permits in the 96-well plate).Thaw compounds, typically stored in 100% DMSO in microfuge tubes at -20 °C, and quickly spin them in a microfuge centrifuge. Serially dilute the compounds in DMSO to achieve a set of five concentrations (four-fold dilutions in this example) at 20 times the desired final assay concentration. Transfer the diluents to wells in the microplate containing an appropriate volume of Running Buffer to yield a final DMSO concentration of 5% (i.e. matching the % of DMSO in Running Buffer with DMSO). These will be injected as Analytes A2-A6.",
    "Add 100% DMSO to the same volume of Running Buffer to the well corresponding to injection of Analyte A1 to yield a final DMSO concentration of 5%. Injection from well A1 will serve as a blank and be used to double-reference the data. Centrifuge the plate using a quick 15-30 second pulse to ensure collection of any compound solution stuck to the walls of the microplate well.Inject compounds at 100 µl/min for a contact time of 90 sec and for variable dissociation times ranging between 60 sec and one hour (as required by individual compounds). Absent any knowledge about a compound’s affinity, preliminary experiments involving injection at a single concentration may have to be performed in order to gauge optimal dissociation times for each compound. Data can be analyzed using ProteOn Software but can also be analyzed using a version of Scrubber software designed for ProteOn data. Double reference all signals (using L1 & A1) and correct for excluded volume effects by applying the DMSO calibration curve.Sensorgrams for all the concentrations tested should be fit simultaneously, i.e. globally. In general, data should be always first fit to a simple 1:1 kinetic model which yields the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD), the maximum binding capacitance of the surface Rmax, (which may differ from the theoretical maximum binding capacitance) and the rate constants of association (ka) and dissociation (kd). In a simple 1:1 kinetic model, single values of ka, kd and Rmax are obtained. Both Scrubber and ProteOn fitting routines solve for the parameters ka and kd. KD is then calculated as the ratio of kd/ka. Use of other more complex models that require more than one value for any of these parameters should be explicitly stated.",

Filibuvir Binding to NS5B ΔC21. Sensorgrams of Filibuvir binding are shown. Filibuvir was injected for a contact time of 90 sec at concentrations of (from top to bottom) 4 µM (orange), 1 µM (pink), 0.25 µM (green), 0.0625 µM (blue) and 0.0156 µM (cyan). Dissociation was monitored for 180 sec. The fit to the data are shown as solid lines."
