    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCell culture and preparation of pellet\nTiming: 2 days before start of experiment\nSeed two 150-mm dishes with 5 × 106 HEK293T cells (between passages 2–10). Culture until about 90% confluent (∼48 h) in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin-streptomycin, L-glutamine (2 mM) and sodium bicarbonate (44 mM) in incubator with 5% CO2 at 37°C.\nAspirate medium and wash adherent cells twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Detach cells with 3 mL of trypsin-EDTA, 5 min at 37°C.\nCombine cells from both dishes, and resuspend in 10 mL of DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin-streptomycin, L-glutamine (2 mM), and sodium bicarbonate (44 mM) in a 15 mL centrifuge tube, and pellet by centrifuging at 1,000×g for 5 min.\nRemove medium and wash cells twice with ice-cold PBS, and re-pellet cells at 1,000×g for 5 min.\nNote: For in situ cross-linking of live cells (i.e., not lysates) proceed to step 24 (i.e., skip steps 5–23).\nCritical: The cells can be snap-frozen at this stage and stored at −80°C. Altered interaction of MSC constituents was not observed by freezing. However, the stability of other protein-complexes may be affected by the freeze-thaw process, and should be determined by immunoprecipitation experiments before proceeding to cross-linking.\nLysis of cells and preparation of lysate\nTiming: 2 h\nNote: Protein A/G magnetic beads (Pierce) should be blocked in pre-blocking buffer for 1 h during cell lysis procedure in readiness for pre-clearing step when cell lysates are being prepared.\nCritical: Use ice-cold lysis buffer and add protease inhibitor just before cell lysis.\nAdd protease inhibitor to 1× final concentration in lysis buffer.\nAdd a 1.4 mL volume of lysis buffer to the cell pellet and mix gently by trituration until particulates are solubilized to homogeneity.",
    "Transfer lysate to a 2-mL eppendorf tube and mix it in a rotator end-to-end for 30 min at 4°C.\nCentrifuge at 21,000 g for 20 min at 4°C.\nTransfer by pipette the clarified cell lysate into a 2 mL eppendorf tube.\nEstimate lysate protein concentration by BCA or Bradford assay.\nDivide lysate equally (generally between 2-3 mg protein) into two 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes.\nAdd a 30 μL volume of pre-blocked Protein A/G magnetic beads to each tube and mix in end-to-end rotator for 1 h at 4°C.\nSeparate lysate from magnetic beads using a DynaMag-2 magnet and transfer to fresh 1.5 mL eppendorf tube. The lysate is ready for immunoaffinity pulldown.\nImmunoaffinity pulldown using antibody targeting bait protein, and chemical cross-linking of bait and associated proteins\nTiming: 1 day\nAdd target-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody in one tube and IgG control antibody in the other, and mix in an end-to-end rotator for 4 h at 4°C. In our experiments we used an antibody against human glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS1) custom generated using the human EPRS1 linker domain (Leu753 to Thr956).\nAdd a 60 μL volume of pre-blocked Protein A/G magnetic beads suspended in lysis buffer to each tube, and mix for 12–16 h in an end-to-end rotator at 4°C.\nNote: There are multiple ways to do the pull-down. The antibody can be first immobilized on Protein A/G magnetic beads to be added directly to the cell lysate followed by overnight incubation. Alternatively, the antibody can be incubated overnight with the cell lysate, and Protein A/G magnetic beads added the next morning for 2–4 h incubation in an end-to-end rotator.\nCritical: The antibody-to-lysate ratio will differ for every bait protein, and should be standardized before proceeding with the pull-down.",
    "Next day, the beads are collected using a DynaMag-2 magnet and the lysate carefully withdrawn by pipet without disturbing the beads.\nThe beads are washed with a 1 mL volume of ice-cold wash buffer for 15 min on an end-to-end rotator at 4°C.\nCollect beads again using DynaMag-2 magnet and repeat the wash step three more times.\nAfter removing the final wash buffer, wash the beads again with 1 mL of cross-linking buffer two times to completely remove residual Tris buffer.\nCritical: Care must be taken to completely remove any trace of Tris buffer from the beads as the amine-containing buffer interferes with the DSSO cross-linking reaction, and in fact, is used to quench the reaction as described below. Final pH of the cross-linking buffer should be between pH 7.8–8.0.\nNote: During the final washing step with cross-linking buffer, prepare a 50 mM DSSO solution by dissolving 0.5 mg of DSSO in 26 μL of DMSO, followed by a brief vortex to dissolve. For in cellulo cross-linking skip steps (20) to (23).\nAfter the final wash, resuspend beads in a 400 μL volume of cross-linking buffer and add an 8 μL volume of the 50 mM DSSO solution to yield a final concentration of 1 mM. Discard leftover DSSO solution.\nVortex beads gently to resuspend and mix for 45 min at 25°C in a thermomixer.\nCritical: The beads tend to settle in the thermomixer. For efficient cross-linking, resuspend beads by gentle vortexing every 15 min.\nStop the reaction by addition of a 8 μL volume of quenching buffer (20 mM final concentration) for 30 min at 25°C in thermomixer.\nCollect cross-linked beads using a DynaMag-2 magnet and proceed to on-bead tryptic digestion for mass spectrometry (step 28).\nAlternate procedure for cross-linking in live cells\nTiming: 1 day",
    "Resuspend pelleted HEK293T cells in a 1.88 mL volume of hypotonic buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail.\nAdd a 120 μL volume of DSSO (50 mM in DMSO; prepared by dissolving 2.5 mg DSSO in 130 μL volume of DMSO) to yield a final concentration of 3 mM, and mix for 1 h in an end-to-end rotator at 4°C. Discard leftover DSSO solution.\nCritical: Incubation time can vary based on cell type and the protein or complex of interest. This should be standardized on a case-by-case basis by progressively increasing the incubation time and scoring for new-cross links.\nThe cross-linking reaction is stopped by addition of a 40 μL volume of quenching buffer (1 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8 to final concentration of 20 mM) for 30 min on an end-to-end rotator.\nReturn to steps (5) through (19). After completion of step (19) proceed to step (28).\nTrypsin digestion and sample preparation for mass spectrometry\nTiming: 2 days\nResuspend beads in a 10 μL volume of 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate containing 100 ng trypsin (10 ng/μL).\nVortex samples for 15 s every 2–3 min for 15 min at room temperature (∼25°C).\nContinue digestion for 12–16 h at 37°C in thermomixer.\nNext morning, add a second aliquot of 100 ng trypsin in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate, and incubate in thermomixer at 37°C for 4 h.\nCollect supernatant using a DynaMag-2 magnet, and dilute with formic acid (5% v/v, final concentration).\nRemove salts from supernatants with PepClean C-18 spin columns, and dry sample completely with a vacuum concentrator.\nReconstitute dried samples in a 30 μL volume of 1% acetic acid.\nMass spectrometry and identification of proximate cross-linked peptides\nTiming: 1 day",
    "Perform LC-MS experiments using an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid MS instrument coupled to an Ultimate 3000 UHPLC system equipped with a 2-cm reverse-phase C18 trapping column and a 15-cm reverse-phase C18 analytical column.\nLoad a 5 μL volume of digested peptides (1–2 μg protein) onto the trapping column with solvent A (0.1% formic acid), at a flow rate of 10 μL/min for 5 min. After desalting, elute the peptide onto the analytical column and fractionate for 140 min using a gradient of solvent A/solvent B (80% acetonitrile/20% water/0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 0.3 μL/min.\nGradient:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1483_12.csv\nPerform three LC-MS/MS experiments on the cross-linked samples i.e., a data-dependent acquisition (DDA), MS2-MS3, and electron-transfer and higher-energy collision dissociation (EThcD).\nNote: See Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for parameters used in LC-MS/MS experiments.\nFor the DDA method, switch between MS1 scans for molecular weight measurement and MS/MS experiments for peptide sequencing.\nFor the MS2-MS3 experiments, perform low energy MS2 experiments on ions with charges between 4 and 8. Perform MS3 experiments on ions with a mass difference of 31.9721 Da, i.e., the mass difference between the alkene and thiol forms of DSSO cross-linked peptides.\nFor EthcD experiments, perform two MS2 experiments, EThcD and low-energy collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments on ions with charges between 4 and 8.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1483_13.csv\nData and error analysis for mass spectrometry\nTiming: 1–2 days\nPerform data analysis in Proteome Discoverer 2.4.\nNote: See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] for processing and workflow for analysis of XL-MS datasets using Proteome Discoverer 2.4.\nFor analysis of the DDA dataset, search against a species-specific sequence database such as human SwissProtKB (see parameters in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nFor DDA searches, export protein identifications for all proteins identified by at least 2 peptides at a peptide and protein false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%.",
    "Note: Peptide FDR rates are estimated using the Percolator algorithm, a semi-supervised machine learning approach that compares peptide scores in searches performed against the forward and reverse (decoy) databases. Only high-confidence peptides are considered.\nFor analysis of XL-MS datasets, use the XlinkX node bundled into Proteome Discoverer 2.4 (see parameters in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]) to search against the database generated in the DDA analysis.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1483-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Workflow for processing and for analysis of XL-MS datasets using Proteome Discoverer 2.4\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1483_14.csv\nNote: FDR is estimated using XlinkX validator node. Only consider high-confidence peptides.\nCross-links identified in the MS2-MS3 analysis are interrogated to ensure that 3 or more of the 4 expected peptides are fragmented, and the spectra for these peptides contain sequence-specific ions consistent with the identified peptides.\nCross-links identified from the EthcD analysis are interrogated to ensure that sequence-specific ions consistent with both cross-linked peptides are identified in the spectrum.\nCritical: Prior to running cross-linked samples, perform an instrument QC to check chromatographic response, instrument response, and mass calibration.\nCross-link validation and modeling individual complex constituents\nTiming: 3 weeks\nOur XL-MS-based analysis of the MSC revealed a total of 137 cross-links, including both intra- and inter-protein cross-links (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). In vitro and in cellulo analyses yielded 131 and 57 cross-links, respectively, consistent with a substantially greater efficiency of the former (Tables S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1483-Mmc1.xlsx] and S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1483-Mmc2.pdf]). However, the overlap between the groups was high as 51 of 57 cross-links detected in cellulo were also present in the in vitro analysis. Importantly, no inconsistencies, e.g., steric conflicts, were introduced by cross-links detected by either approach.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1483-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. XL-MS-derived crosslinks for human MSC\n(A) Intra-protein cross-links within constituents of the MSC (black curved lines).\n(B) Inter-protein cross-links between constituents of the MSC (dashed lines).",
    "For cross-links in constituents or sub-complexes of known structure, use reported crystal or NMR structure from Protein Data Bank (PDB) to validate newly obtained intra- and inter-protein cross-links (e.g., in our experiment, EPRS1 and KARS1-AIMP2, respectively (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1483-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Validation of XL-MS-derived crosslinks for human MSC\n(A) Intra-protein cross-link distances within structure of human EARS1 domain of EPRS1. EARS1 was modeled based on homology to the archaebacterium Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus EARS1 (PDB ID: 3AII). Cross-linked Lys residues are shown as atom-level structures (yellow), and cross-links are indicated (line of yellow spheres).\n(B) Inter-protein cross-link distances between AIMP2 and KARS1 in X-ray crystal structure (PDB ID: 6ILD). XL-MS-derived cross-linked Lys residues are highlighted (yellow spheres) and Inter-protein cross-links indicated (line of orange spheres). Figure reprinted with permission from Khan et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8].\nTo build structures for proteins where homologous structures are available for non-human species only, perform homology modeling using SWISS-MODEL program.\nFor individual constituents of unknown or incomplete structure, perform de novo modeling with SWISS-MODEL to build full-length structure. SWISS-MODEL uses a library of previously published structures to search for proteins with significant sequence similarity compared to the sequence of the modelled protein. Construct model from structurally conserved regions extracted from selected template structures; missing residues can be modeled de novo. Accommodate the distance restraints provided by intra-protein crosslinks during modeling.\nNote: Detailed information regarding the modeling of individual constituents of the MSC has been reported (Khan et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nAdjustment of reported structures to conform to cross-link data\nTiming: 1–2 days",
    "Note: Cross-links of Lys residues at distances between about 10 and 27 Å in crystal or NMR structures validate the approach and methodology. Occasionally, distances between cross-linked amino acids in published X-ray structures can substantially exceed the ∼27 Å distance limit. The discrepancy between the X-ray and XL-MS data can result from low-confidence data in the crystal structure due to mobile domains, distortion of the structure due to high-density packing in the crystal, or altered conformation of the target when present under intracellular conditions, e.g., in a complex.\nWhen sufficient justification is provided, e.g., by multiple discrepant cross-links, modify the conformation to constrain the lengths of these cross-links to less than ∼27 Å (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Biochemical activity data can provide support for the altered conformation, as was the case with the XL-MS-based structural modification of QARS1 (Ognjenovic et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Khan et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1483-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Adjustment of QARS1 structure by XL-MS-derived intra-links\n(Top) XL-MS-derived intra-links in QARS1; cross-links between N-terminal domain (NTD) and catalytic domain (CAT) are highlighted (red). (Left) Crystal structure (PDB ID: 4YE6) of the NTD (red) and CAT (pink) of QARS1 showing 3 cross-links much greater than the ∼27 Å limit (left). (Right) Amended model of QARS1 with XL-MS-derived cross-links within distance constraints of the cross-linker. Figure reprinted with permission from Khan et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1483-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. XL-MS-derived cross-links can provide evidence for homo-dimers\n(Left) Cross-link (red dashed line) in monomeric structure exceeds distance constraint of the cross-linker. (Right) Cross-link in dimeric structure is within distance constraint of the cross-linker.\nCritical: Dimers, particularly those in a head-to-tail conformation, can confound the analysis as apparent long cross-links in the monomeric crystal structure can be due to short cross-links spanning the dimer interface (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nModeling of the holo-MSC\nTiming: 3 weeks",
    "Using the protein-protein docking program PatchDock, assemble the MSC in a step-wise manner by one-at-a-time docking constituents or sub-complexes to the partially assembled complex retaining the constraints provided by inter-molecular cross-links. For example, the modified QARS1 model was docked with the pentameric AARS core (comprising EPRS1, MARS1, AIMP2, AIMP3, and DARS1) using the distant constraints obtained from QARS1-EPRS1 and QARS1-AIMP2 intermolecular cross-links.\nVisualize model using the molecular visualization program PyMOL (see Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6] for example).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1483-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.
