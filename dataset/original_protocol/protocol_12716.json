  "procedures": [
    "The present study was performed with the approval and following the guidelines of the animal ethical committee of the University of Zürich (#ZH149/19). Male C57Bl/6J mice aged 8-16 weeks, bred and housed in specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions, were used for the present study. The intact bones can be kept on ice in sterile Hank's buffered saline solution (HBSS) with 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). Bone marrow was collected from the femur and tibia of the mouse25 on the day of differentiation. Both methods for assessing caspase activity can be used for other cell types, including both primary and transformed.\n1. Differentiating bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs)\nNOTE: Perform all the steps in a tissue culture laminar flow hood, and use sterile aseptic techniques.\nPrepare a 1 mL syringe with a 21 G needle.\nAdd 5 mL of HBSS + 2% FBS to a 15 mL tube.\nUsing sterile forceps, take an excised femur, and insert the needle into the opening of the femur. Holding the femur in the HBSS + 2% FBS, flush the bone marrow out until the bone is white. Flush the tibia in the same manner. Continue to flush the solution to obtain a single-cell suspension.\nCentrifuge the single-cell suspension at 200 x g for 4 min at room temperature (RT).\nRemove the supernatant using a vacuum aspirator. Tap the tube to gently resuspend the pellet. Add 1 mL of red cell lysis buffer (see Table of Materials), and mix gently with a P1,000 pipette. Incubate at RT for 1 min.\nAdd 10 mL of HBSS + 2% FBS, and centrifuge at 200 x g for 4 min at RT.\nRemove the supernatant, and resuspend in 10 mL of bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) culture medium.",
    "NOTE: BMDM culture medium consists of low-glucose DMEM with the addition of 10% FBS, 20 ng/ml M-CSF, penicillin (50 U/mL), and streptomycin (50 μg/mL) (see Table of Materials). Alternatively, 20% L929 conditioned medium can be substituted for the M-CSF.\nAdd 15 mL of BMDM culture medium into two 15 cm Petri dishes. Add 5 mL of the single-cell solution to each plate.\n\tNOTE: Do not use tissue culture-treated plates. Tissue culture-treated plates limit the differentiation.\nPlace the dishes at 37 °C, 5% CO2, for 6 days.\n\t​NOTE: The BMDMs can be harvested after 5-7 days. Longer incubation times for differentiation lead to increased anti-apoptotic protein expression26.\n2. Harvesting, seeding, and treatment of cells\nNOTE: Perform all the steps in a tissue culture laminar flow hood, and use sterile aseptic techniques. Fully differentiated macrophages adhere to the plate, allowing for easy separation, while floating cells can be discarded. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) can be used with or without Ca2+ and Mg2+.\nAfter 6 days of incubation, remove the floating cells and medium from the plate using an aspirator.\nAdd 5 mL of PBS to each 15 cm plate. Remove the PBS from the plate using an aspirator.\nAdd 2 mL of trypsin (see Table of Materials) to each plate. Incubate the plate until gentle tapping of the plate dislodges the cells. Take 5 mL of BMDM culture medium, and harvest the cells off the plate.\n\t\nTransfer to the second 15 cm plate, and harvest the cells off the plate. Remove the cell suspension from the plate into a 50 mL tube. Take an additional 5 mL of BMDM culture medium, and wash both plates to ensure all the cells have been collected. Place the cell suspension into the same 50 mL tube.",
    "Take 10 μL of the cell suspension, and count using a hemacytometer using a 1:1 dilution with trypan blue.\n\tNOTE: Automatic cell counters can be used as well when calibrated for the size of the macrophages.\nSeed the macrophages at a density of 1 x 106 cells/mL. BMDMs seeded at 2 x 106 cells/well in a 6-well plate provide approximately 2 mg/mL total protein. Allow the cells to adhere to the plate for a minimum of 6 h before treatment.\n\tNOTE: For other cell types, the optimal concentration must be determined.\nTreat the macrophages with Smac mimetic (Compound A, see Table of Materials)22 at 250 nM and 500 nM for 16 h.\n\t​NOTE: Include a positive control to induce apoptosis and caspase-3 cleavage to ensure the assay is working. Common apoptosis inducers include staurosporine and etoposide. For many cell lines to undergo apoptosis, 0.1-10 μM for 16 h of stimulation is sufficient.\n3. Preparing cell lysates from treated cells\nNOTE: This step must be done on ice, and the reagents and materials must be pre-cooled.\nTransfer the plates containing the treated cells onto the ice. Collect the medium from the cell culture into a 1.5 mL tube, centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C, aspirate the medium, and put the tube on ice. This allows the collection of the cells that have detached from the plate.\nAdd 1 mL of cold PBS to the cell culture plate for washing the cells, and aspirate all the PBS. Add 100 μL of trypsin to the cells (if working with a 6-well dish). Allow the trypsin to lift the cells off the plate, and collect them into the 1.5 mL tube. Use 1 mL of cold PBS to ensure all the cells have been collected.",
    "NOTE: If working with suspension cells, gently transfer the medium and cells to a 1.5 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant, and resuspend in 100 μL DISC lysis buffer (150 mM sodium chloride, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, see Table of Materials).\nIncubate the samples on ice for 20 min.\nCentrifuge the lysates at ~12,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet the insoluble fraction.\nTransfer 25 μL of the lysate into a white flat-bottomed 96-well plate for the caspase-3/caspase-7 activity assay (step 5).\n\tNOTE: Do not disturb the pellet. This is the insoluble fraction of the cell lysate.\nTransfer 10 μL of the remaining lysate into a transparent flat-bottomed 96-well plate for the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (step 4). This will be used for the normalization of the samples.\nKeep both plates on ice for further processing.\n\t​NOTE: At this stage, the plates can be sealed with an adhesive cover and stored at −20 °C for approximately 4 weeks.\n4. Protein quantification using the BCA assay\nNOTE: Other reagents or assays can be used to quantitate the amount of protein in each sample. In the population-based assay, the samples can be compared by normalizing the amount of protein used in the assay.\nPrepare standard protein concentrations between 0 μg/mL and 2,000 μg/mL (0 μg/mL, 25 μg/mL, 125 μg/mL, 250 μg/mL, 500 μg/mL, 750 μg/mL, 100 μg/mL, 1,500 μg/mL, 2,000 μg/mL) with bovine serum albumin (BSA). Prepare blanks with lysis buffer only.\nAdd 10 μL of each standard into the flat-bottomed 96-well plate containing the samples, mentioned in step 3.7.",
    "Mix BCA reagent 1 with BCA reagent 2 in a 50:1 ratio (see Table of Materials). Add 200 μL of mixed BCA reagent to each sample and standard.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 30 min.\nMeasure the absorbance at 562 nm on a fluorometric instrument, and quantify the protein concentration with the standard curve.\n5. Population-based assay for caspase-3/caspase-7 activity\nNOTE: Do not allow the cell lysates in the plate to sit on ice for more than 3 h. If caspase activity is present, this increases over time despite the sample being on ice. If the samples were frozen, thaw them on ice, and proceed immediately once the lysates have thawed.\nStart the fluorometric instrument (see Table of Materials) and heat the machine to 37 °C. Prepare the script as mentioned:\n\t\nPerform individual readings every minute for 40 min in order to determine the kinetics of the reaction.\nSet the excitation at 360 nm and the emission at 465 nm. Ten flashes per well are sufficient.\nPrepare the positive control of recombinant caspase-3 (see Table of Materials). Mix 1 U of the recombinant caspase-3 enzyme in 50 μL of lysis buffer (tube 1). Add 25 μL of lysis buffer to an additional three tubes. Transfer 25 μL from tube 1 to tube 2. Mix by pipetting.\n\t\nRepeat for tube 3 and tube 4. Tube 5 will contain only 50 μL of lysis buffer. Add 25 μL of each standard into the white flat-bottomed 96-well plate for the caspase-3 activity assay, mentioned in step 3.6.",
    "Prepare a master reaction mix for caspase activity assay on ice. For one reaction, mix 50 μL of 2x caspase cleavage buffer (0.2M HEPES pH 7.5; 20% sucrose or PEG; 0.2% CHAPS), 5 μL of 1 mM DEVD-AMC (caspase-3 tetrapeptide substrate), 2 μL of 500 mM DTT, and 18 μL of deionized water (see Table of Materials).\nAdd 75 μL of the reaction mix to each sample and standard to obtain a total reaction volume of 100 μL.\nImmediately measure the fluorescence using the fluorometric instrument set up in step 5.1.\nFor each fluorescent measurement, subtract the fluorescence reading for the blank (lysis buffer only) from the sample's fluorescence. Normalize the reading by dividing by the protein concentration of the sample (calculated in step 4.5)27:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64745/64745eq01.jpg\nCalculate the rate of caspase activity by determining the slope of the normalized fluorescence on the y-axis and time on the x-axis.\n6. Single-cell assay (flow cytometry analysis) for caspase-3/caspase-7 activity\nSeed the cells as described in section 2.\nHarvest the cells into a 5 mL polystyrene tube. If working with adherent cells, collect the medium into the 5 mL tube. Add 1 mL of cold PBS to the cell culture plate, and collect the PBS into the 5 mL tube. Add trypsin to the cells (100 μL if working with 6-well dishes). Allow the trypsin to lift the cells off the plate, and collect into the 5 mL tube. Use 1 mL of cold PBS to ensure all the cells have been collected.\n\tNOTE: If working with suspension cells, gently transfer the medium and cells to a 5 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the samples at 300 x g for 5 min, 4 °C. Remove the supernatant using a vacuum aspirator.",
    "Prepare the staining mix. The optimal staining concentration is 1 x 106-2 x 106 cells in 50 μL. Dilute the fluorogenic substrate as per the manufacturer's instructions (see Table of Materials, flow cytometry). Take 1 μL of the stock substrate, and dilute in 150 μL of PBS. Add 50 uL per sample.\nIncubate the samples at 37 °C for 30 min protected from light, with mixing every 15 min.\nWith the flow cytometer utilized in this study, use the red laser at 640 nm, and detect using 675/25 nm. Run the unstained control sample first, and acquire a minimum of 10,000 events of the desired population. Exclude the debris using a gate (P1) on an FSC-A and SSC-A dot plot.\n\t\nUse a histogram displaying the events in the P1 gate and detection for the caspase substrate (y-axis) to determine the median fluorescence intensity (MFI).\n\t\tNOTE: The caspase substrate described in this method requires an excitation at 590 nm and emits at 628 nm."
