    "All fish work was conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (approval identification number 24-2) of the National Institute of Genetics (Japan), which has an Animal Welfare Assurance on file (assurance number A5561-01) at the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare of the National Institutes of Health (NIH, USA).\n1. Construction of BACs for expression of optogenetic TDP-43 gene from the mnr2b promoter\nBAC preparation\n\t\nPurchase a zebrafish BAC clone containing the zebrafish mnr2b locus (CH211-172N16, BACPAC Genomics). Purify the BAC DNA from a 5 mL overnight LB culture of DH10B Escherichia coli (E. coli) harboring CH211-172N16 as described in Warming et al.18.\nTransform CH211-172N16 into SW102 E. coli cells by electroporation, as described in Warming et al.18.\n\t\tNOTE: Purification of the BAC DNA from the E. coli on the same day of electroporation usually gives a higher success rate of BAC transformation18. Otherwise, the purified BAC DNA is kept at -20 °C until use.\nIntroduce the iTol2-amp cassette for Tol2 transposon-mediated BAC transgenesis19 into the backbone of CH211-172N16 by electroporation, as described in Asakawa et al.20.\n\t\t\nMake a glycerol stock of the E. coli cell clones carrying CH211-172N16 with the iTol2-amp cassette integration (CH211-172N16-iTol2A) after confirming the homologous recombination-mediated integration by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Ex Taq) using the primer pair Tol2-L-out (5'-AAA GTA TCT GGC TAG AAT CTT ACT TGA-3') and pTARBAC-13371r (5'-TAG CGG CCG CAA ATT TAT TA-3') and the following conditions: a denaturation step at 98 °C for 1 min, followed by 25 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s, primer annealing at 55 °C for 15 s, and primer extension at 72 °C for 1 min, amplifying a PCR product of 354 base pairs (bp).\nmnr2b-hs:opTDP-43h construction",
    "Construct a plasmid carrying the expression cassette for the human wild-type TDP-43/TARDBP (TDP-43h) that is tagged with mRFP1 and CRY2olig at the N- and C-termini, respectively (hereafter, opTDP-43h)14.\n\t\t​NOTE: The opTDP-43h fragment should be flanked with the zebrafish hsp70l gene promoter sequence (650 bp) and polyadenylation (polyA) signal sequence, followed by a kanamycin resistance gene (hsp70lp-opTDP-43h-polyA-Kan)14.\nAmplify the hsp70l-opTDP-43h-polyA-Kan cassette with primers that anneal hsp70l and Kan and contain 45 bp sequences of the upstream and downstream of the initiator codons of the mnr2b gene by PCR (GXL DNA Polymerase) using the primer pair mnr2b-hspGFF-Forward (5'-tat cag cgc aat tac ctg caa ctc taa aca caa caa aag tgt tgc aGA ATT CAC TGG AGG CTT CCA GAA C-3') and Km-r (5'-ggt tct tca gct aaa agg gcg tcg atc ctg aag ttc ttt gac ttt tcc atC AAT TCA GAA GAA CTC GTC AAG AA-3') with the following conditions: a denaturation step at 98 °C for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s, primer annealing at 55 °C for 15 s, and primer extension at 68 °C for 30 s, amplifying a PCR product of ~5.7 bp.\nSeparate the PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis (100 V) and purify the hsp70lp-opTDP-43h-polyA-Kan DNA band with a DNA column. Adjust the concentration of the purified hsp70lp-opTDP-43h-polyA-Kan cassette to 50 ng/µL in Tris-EDTA buffer (TE) containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mM EDTA.\nIntroduce the hsp70lp-opTDP-43h-polyA-Kan cassette into CH211-172N16-iTol2A by electroporation as described in Warming et al.18 and select ampicillin- and kanamycin-resistant transformants on LB agar plates. CH211-172N16-iTol2A carrying the hsp70lp-opTDP-43h-polyA-Kan cassette is designated as mnr2b-hs:opTDP-43h.\nPurify mnr2b-hs:opTDP-43h using a BAC purification kit and dissolve it at 250 ng/µL in TE after phenol/chloroform extraction.\nmnr2b-hs:EGFP-TDP-43z construction",
    "Construct another plasmid carrying the zebrafish wild-type tardbp that is tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) at its N-terminus (EGFP-TDP-43z) instead of opTDP-43h but is otherwise identical to the hsp70l-opTDP-43h-polyA-Kan construct (hsp70l-EGFP-TDP-43z-polyA-Kan)14. Use EGFP-TDP-43z as an internal control for the light stimulation of opTDP-43h.\nConstruct CH211-172N16-iTol2A harboring the hsp70lp-EGFP-TDP-43z-polyA-Kan cassette in the mnr2b locus as described in 1.2.1-1.2.5. CH211-172N16-iTol2A carrying the hsp70lp-EGFP-TDP-43z-polyA-Kan cassette is designated as mnr2b-hs:EGFP-TDP-43z.\n2. Tol2 transposon-mediated BAC transgenesis in zebrafish\nPrepare the injection solution containing 40 mM KCl, phenol red (10% v/v), 25 ng/µL of the mnr2b-hs:opTDP-43h DNA, and 25 ng/µL Tol2 transposase mRNA19.\nInject 1 nL of the injection solution (a droplet with a diameter of approximately 123 µm calibrated in mineral oil) into the cytosol of wild-type zebrafish embryos at the one-cell stage. Screen the injected fish for the formation of red fluorescent protein (RFP)-positive aggregates in various embryonic tissues, including spinal motor neurons, under a fluorescence stereomicroscope at 2-3 days post-fertilization (dpf). Raise the RFP-positive fish to adulthood.\nInject the mnr2b-hs:EGFP-TDP-43z DNA as described in 2.1 and 2.2. Raise EGFP-positive fish to adulthood.\nAfter a few months, put sexually matured injected fish and wild-type fish in pairs in standard 2 L mating cages to obtain F1 offspring. Screen F1 fish at 3 dpf for RFP (opTDP-43h) or EGFP (EGFP-TDP-43z) fluorescence in the spinal motor column using an epifluorescence microscope equipped with a Plan-Neofluar 5x/0.15 objective lens. Typically, one founder fish is identified from 10−20 injected fish (the germline transmission rate is 5%−10%).\nIsolate and compare multiple Tg[mnr2b-hs:opTDP-43h] and Tg[mnr2b-hs:EGFP-TDP-43z] inserts from different founder fish, as the intensity, but not the pattern, of opTDP-43h or EGFP-TDP-43z expression may vary between founder fish due to chromosomal position effects.",
    "Cross Tg[mnr2b-hs:opTDP-43h] and Tg[mnr2b-hs:EGFP-TDP-43z] fish lines to obtain offspring containing Tg[mnr2b-hs:opTDP-43h] Tg[mnr2b-hs:EGFP-TDP-43z] double-transgenic fish in a Mendelian ratio.\nRaise the fish in a plastic dish containing 30 mL of E3 buffer (5 mM NaCl, 0.17 mM KCl, 0.33 mM CaCl2, 0.33 mM MgSO4, 10-5% Methylene Blue) and add 0.003% (w/v) N-phenylthiourea at 8-10 h post-fertilization (hpf) to inhibit melanogenesis.\nCover the plastic dish with aluminum foil after 30 hpf.\n3. Preparation of LED for blue light illumination\nTurn on an LED panel by using the associated application installed on a tablet/phone. Put the probe of a spectrometer into an empty well of a 6 well dish and adjust the LED light to the wavelength peaking at ~456 nm through the application. Place the optical sensor of an optical power meter in the empty well and adjust the power of the LED light (~0.61 mW/cm2). The LED light setting can be saved and is retrievable in the application.\nIntroduce the dish/LED panel setting to the incubator at 28 °C. Finish this step before imaging of fish starts at 48 hpf.\n4. Imaging of zebrafish larvae expressing optogenetic TDP-43\nSelect Tg[mnr2b-hs:opTDP-43h] Tg[mnr2b-hs:EGFP-TDP-43z] double-transgenic fish at least before 47 hpf, based on RFP (opTDP-43h) or EGFP (EGFP-TDP-43z) fluorescence in the spinal motor column using the epifluorescence microscope set-up described above.\nDechorionate the Tg[mnr2b-hs:opTDP-43h] Tg[mnr2b-hs:EGFP-TDP-43z] double-transgenic fish.\nPreheat 1% low melting temperature agarose containing 250 µg/mL of ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate salt at 42 °C.\nBriefly anesthetize Tg[mnr2b-hs:opTDP-43h] Tg[mnr2b-hs:EGFP-TDP-43] double-transgenic fish at 48 hpf in E3 buffer containing the same concentration of Tricane.\nPut a drop of the preheated 1% low melting temperature agarose on the glass base dish at the room temperature. The diameter of the dome-shaped agarose drop on the glass dish is 8-10 mm.",
    "Using a Pasteur pipette, add the anesthetized fish to the low melting temperature agarose on the glass base dish, and then mix by pipetting a few times. Minimize the amount of the E3 buffer added to the agarose along with the fish.\nMaintain the fish on its side by using a syringe needle during the solidification of agarose (typically ~1 min) to ensure that the spinal cord is in an appropriate horizontal position. After the solidification, put a couple of drops of E3 buffer onto the dome-shaped agarose-mounted fish.\nAcquire serial confocal z-sections of the spinal cord by scanning with a confocal microscope equipped with a 20x water immersion objective lens with the numerical aperture 1.00, using a scan speed of 4.0 µs per pixel (12 bits per pixel), a step size of 1.0 µm per slice for the objective, and a combination of excitation/emission wavelengths: Channel 1) 473/510 nm for EGFP and Channel 2) 559/583 nm for mRFP1.\n\tNOTE: The cloaca on the ventral side of the fish is included in the regions of interest (ROI) as a reference, which helps to identify and compare the spinal segments (levels 16-17) across the time points.\nRemove the fish from the agarose by carefully cracking the agarose with a syringe needle as soon as the imaging is complete. Keep the amount of time the fish is embedded in the agarose as short as possible, although the agarose embedding for <30 min does not affect the viability of the fish.\n5. Light stimulation of opTDP-43h-expressing fish by field illumination of a blue light-emitting diode (LED) light",
    "Add 7.5 mL of E3 buffer to the well and place the imaged Tg[mnr2b-hs:opTDP-43h] Tg[mnr2b-hs:EGFP-TDP-43z] double-transgenic fish into the well. Place the six-well dish on the LED panel by keeping the dish and LED panel 5 mm apart with a spacer (for example, with five slide glasses stacked).\nTurn on the blue LED light. Keep some of the Tg[mnr2b-hs:opTDP-43h] Tg[mnr2b-hs:EGFP-TDP-43z] double-transgenic fish in a separate six-well dish covered with aluminum foil when unilluminated control fish are necessary (i.e., in dark conditions)14.\nAfter the illumination (e.g., for 24 h at 72 hpf in Figure 3), image the spinal cord of the illuminated fish by repeating the steps 4.3 - 4.9.\n6. Visualization of cytoplasmic relocation of optogenetic TDP-43 in the spinal motor neurons\nOpen the image file in ImageJ/Fiji21 (Version: 2.1.0/1.53c), an open-source Java image processing program developed by NIH Image, which can be downloaded from https://imagej.net/Fiji/Downloads.\nUse the Z scrollbar to move through the focal planes. Create a maximum intensity projection of multiple slices by clicking Image | Stacks | Z project | Max Intensity and setting Start slice and Stop slice that cover the hemisegments of the spinal motor column.\nSplit the multichannel image into two single-channel images by clicking Image | Color | Split Channels.\nEnhance the EGFP-TDP-43z signal to ensure that cytoplasmic EGFP-TDP-43z is visible clearly by clicking Image | Adjust | Brightness/Contrast and adjusting Minimum\nOpen the ROI manager by clicking Analyze | Tools | ROI manager. Find the cells that are identifiable in both images at 48 hpf and 72 hpf, based on the relative positions of the cell bodies. Set the ROIs by outlining the contours of cell bodies of single spinal motor neurons visualized by the EGFP-TDP-43z signal using Freehand selections, and then clicking Add[t] in the ROI manager.",
    "Set a major axis of the soma by drawing a straight line using Straight and clicking Analyze | Plot Profile for EGFP-TDP-43z (C1) and opTDP-43h (C2) images at 48 and 72 hpf.\nNormalize the Plot Profile by dividing the values by the greatest value for each EGFP-TDP-43z and opTDP-43h signal. Plot the normalized values with x-y coordinates, where x and y represent the major axis of the soma and relative fluorescent intensities, respectively, using XY graph in a statistical software.\n7. Ratiometric comparison between opTDP-43h and EGFP-TDP-43z signals using ImageJ/Fiji\nOpen the image file in ImageJ/Fiji and set ROIs for single mnr2b-positive cells using a maximum intensity projection image of EGFP-TDP-43z as in 6.1-6.5. Add a ROI outside the ventral spinal cord (e.g., notochord) to represent the background signal (background ROI).\nFor each EGFP-TDP-43z and opTDP-43 image, create a projection of multiple slices by clicking Image | Stacks | Z project | Sum Slices and set Start slice and Stop slice that cover the hemispinal motor column.\nOpen the ROI manager created with the maximum intensity projection image. Display the ROIs on the Sum Slices image by selecting the image window for EGFP-TDP-43z and then clicking Show All in the ROI manager. Click Measure in the ROI manager to obtain mean values for each ROI.\nAcquire mean values for opTDP-43h following the same procedure provided in 7.3.\nFor each ROI, after subtracting the mean for the background ROI, divide the subtracted mean for opTDP-43h by the subtracted mean for EGFP-TDP-43z to obtain the ratiometric value. The ratiometric values can be compared between different time points and presented using Column graph in Prism software.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
