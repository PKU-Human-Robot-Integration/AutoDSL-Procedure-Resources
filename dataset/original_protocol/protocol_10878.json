    "1. Ovarian dissection and tissue isolation\nPrepare a 0.5% (w/v) solution of sodium alginate, prepare from a modified version of the protocol described previously5, using sterile PBS and heat to 37°C. Mix by inversion or rocking, but do not vortex. Draw the alginate into a 1 ml syringe with a 25 G needle and maintain at 37°C.\nPrepare 10mM sterile CaCl2 solution for crosslinking the alginate upon tissue encapsulation and warm to 37°C.\nPrepare 1mL of culture medium (αMEM + 5 units penicillin and 5 μg/ml streptomycin) per well in a 24 well plate for each experiment. Include various drugs, peptides, or viruses in the culture medium. For transfection prior to organ encapsulation, incubate tissue with Lipofectamine 2000 and plasmid DNA for four hours at 37 °C.\nDissect the organs from the animal, remove any fat or residual tissue, gently pull off the bursa membrane surrounding the ovary, and cut the ovary or oviduct into four pieces by bisecting the organ. Animals were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation. For the oviduct, gently uncoil the tissue by pulling apart the connecting membranes and extending the ends of the tube in opposite directions using forceps before cutting.\nPlace a single alginate droplet (~1-3 μL) onto a sterilized mesh fiber.\nUsing sterile forceps, move a piece of organ into the alginate droplet and center the droplet using forceps or a sterile needle.\nInvert the droplet containing the organ piece (organoid) by grasping the mesh fiber with sterile forceps and turning it upside down to allow gravity to force the alginate into a hanging drop.\nTap the forceps on the edge of a 10cm petri dish containing 10mM CaCl2 solution so that the drop falls into solution.",
    "Incubate for 2 minutes, remove with sterile spoon containing pores to release extra 10mM CaCl2, and transfer into the culture medium. Up to four alginate gels can be transferred into a single well of a 24 well plate containing the culture medium. Culture for a defined time period.\n2. Degradation of alginate and collection of cells\nFor the solubilization of the alginate gel, incubate the cultures in alginate lyase (3.4 mg/ml) dissolved in Leibovitz's L-15 media at 37°C for 30 minutes or until gel is completely dissolved.\nRemove the tissue from the alginate lyase.\nFor collection of the OSE, incubate the organoid with 500 units of collagenase in Leibovitz's L-15 media for 1 hour8. Vortex in 2 second pulses (2 seconds vortex and 2 seconds rest) on medium power for 1 minute, followed by 1 second pulses (1 second vortex and 1 second rest) for 1 minute. Let organ pieces fall to bottom of microcentrifuge tube and pipette supernatant into fresh sterile microcentrifuge tube. Centrifuge 3 minutes at 3000 rpm to pellet ovarian surface epithelium.\nFor collection of the tubal epithelium, cut the tube lengthwise and place on tissue culture plastic in DMEM with 5 units penicillin and 5 μg/ml streptomycin and 4% (v/v) FBS. Over 3-5 days, cells will \"crawl\" out of the tubal stroma and grow on tissue culture plastic9.\n3. Fixation of alginate encapsulated organ cultures for paraffin sections\nCollect the alginate encapsulated bead from the culture medium at selected time point.\nRecrosslink the alginate to stiffen the gel by dropping the culture into sterile 10mM CaCl2 solution for two minutes.\nFix the alginate encapsulated organ in 2% paraformaldehyde containing 50 mM sucrose, 10 mM CaCl2 and 50 mM sodium cacodylate to ensure that the gel stays solid and fully encapsulates tissue during fixation.",
    "Following tissue processing, embed the entire alginate-encapsulated organ culture piece into paraffin and section with a microtome to generate 5 μm sections.\nThe alginate will be dissolved and removed from the slide if performing immunohistochemistry due to heat based antigen retrieval. The alginate will remain and stain for eosin under standing hematoxylin and eosin staining.\n4. Representative Results:\nAn example of a three-dimensional organ culture of the ovary and oviduct is shown in Figure 1. Ovaries can be cut into different size pieces, and OSE proliferate and migrate to repair the surface that was wounded from the incision with the scalpel. During this process, the correct orientation of the OSE relative to the underlying stroma is maintained, with the OSE encapsulating the ovary. As shown in Figure 2, the OSE of ovaries cut in half encapsulate the ovary more completely as compared to ovaries cut into quarters or eighths. The wound repair of the ovarian surface can be studied in the context of the entire ovary and may shed light on how ovulation and surface repair induces ovarian surface transformation.",
    "The endpoint of the experiment depends on the information that is required. Tissue architecture, cellular morphology, and specific cellular growth rates are easily monitored using paraffin sections. For example, a single layer of ovarian surface epithelium is observed after culturing in serum-free αMEM for 7 days (Figure 3A) while addition of 5 μg/ml insulin for 7 days induces hyperproliferation of the ovarian surface epithelium and formation of multiple layers of cells (Figure 3B). By adding bromodeoxyuridine to the cultures at a final concentration of 10 μM 24 hr prior to fixation, proliferation of cells can be measured (inset 3A and 3B). For cultures maintained in serum-free αMEM, approximately 3-5% of OSE undergo proliferation during the 24 hr labeling period (inset 3A), while a larger percentage of granulosa cells proliferate. Addition of insulin to the culture media increases the percentage of proliferating OSE to approximately 30% of total OSE (inset 3B). Immunofluorescence of green fluorescent protein (GFP) can be visualized through the alginate gel with standard microscopy following cDNA transfection (Figure 3C). While alginate organ culture provides for growth and analysis of ovarian surface epithelium and primary follicles, it should be noted that the mature, secondary follicles fail to survive in this culture system (Figure 3D). Culture of individual follicles to maturity within an alginate hydrogel matrix has been described elsewhere10.\nAlterations in protein or RNA can be analyzed from the entire organ or from specific cell types using enzymatic degradation (Figure 4). Treatment of cultured ovarian organoids with collagenase leaves the underlying stroma intact (Figure 4C) while allowing for enrichment of OSE in the cell pellet obtained following treatment, although some stromal cells are also isolated (Figure 4D).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2804/2804fig1.jpg",
