    "1. Dish Preparation\nDishes used for slice culture are glass-bottomed (with a coverslip as the base) (WillCo dishes). These are placed on lens tissue in a 6 cm tissue culture dish to keep the glass bottom clean.\nOn the day before the experiment, add 2 ml 0.1% poly-L-lysine solution to the glass bottomed dish and incubate for 5min at room temperature to allow the poly-L-lysine to coat the glass bottom.\nRemove poly-L-lysine solution and rinse three times in deionised water, and then once in 70% ethanol.\nLeave to dry overnight. Dishes can also be dried by gently heating in a microwave at low power for 30-45 seconds.\n2. Embryo Electroporation\nIncubate eggs at 37 °C to Hamburger-Hamilton (HH) stage 10 (~36 hours) (or other desired stage).\nBefore beginning prepare glass needles (we use a Flaming/Brown model p87 microcapillary puller) and break off the tip of the needle using a fine forceps under a dissecting microscope. The end of the needle should be sharp enough to pierce the embryo while not being so narrow that it impedes injection of the DNA solution.\nWindow eggs and place electrodes (5mm apart) on either side of the embryo.\nInject DNA (~0.025 - 0.5 μg/μl in deionised water colored with a small amount of fast green) into the neural tube.\nApply current - 12-17 V three times, 50ms pulse length with 950 ms between pulses.\nWe use low concentrations of DNA and low electroporation voltages to achieve mosaic expression so that we can follow individual cells.\nCover window in the eggshell with cellotape and make sure it is sealed.\nAllow embryos to recover for 3-4 hours or overnight at 37 °C.\n3. Collagen and Slice Culture Medium Preparation\nPrepare collagen mix and slice culture medium about an hour before slicing.",
    "To 300 μl type 1 collagen add 100 μl 0.1% acetic acid solution and 100 μl 5 x L15 medium. Vortex thoroughly after each addition. The solution should turn yellow.\nNow add 15-20 μl 7.5% sodium bicarbonate and thoroughly vortex. The solution should become slightly pink, and the volume of sodium bicarbonate required for this may differ. Keep on ice and make up fresh each time.\nTo 10 ml neurobasal medium add B-27 supplement and Glutamax, to a 1 x final concentration and 10 μl Gentamicin solution.\nPlace medium in a 37 °C incubator buffered with 5% CO2. Leave the top of the container loose to allow it to equilibrate with the CO2.\n4. Slice Culture\nRemove embryos from egg and wash in L15 medium.\nPlace in a tissue culture dish with a layer of sylgard at the bottom and pin them out through the surrounding extra-embryonic membranes so that they are stretched taut.\nUsing a microknife, slice embryo as straight as possible through region of interest. For spinal cord, slices should be between 1-2 somites thick. Leave slices attached to embryo while you slice other embryos so you don't lose them.\nPrepare a 200 μl micropipette tip by cutting off ~1 mm of the tip and attaching this to a p2 or p10. This tip will be used to transfer the spinal cord slices to the glass bottom dish. A 10 μl tip is not broad enough to pick up slices.\nCoat the inside of the tip with collagen by pipetting 1 μl collagen mix prepared earlier. Leave for 1-2 mins and then rinse with L15 medium. This will prevent the tissue from sticking to the inside of the tip.",
    "Detach slice from embryo using a microknife and remove from the dish using a p2 or p10 fitted with a 200 μl tip and set to 1 μl. Try to take up as little medium as possible.\nVortex the collagen mix and drop 5-8 μl of this on to the poly-l-lysine coated dish.\nImmediately put embryo slice into collagen and position into place with a pair of fine forceps. Slices should be positioned so that the side to be imaged is flush with the coverslip. The tissue should adhere to the poly-l-lysine coating on the coverslip.\nRepeat this until you have several slices on the coverslip. We can usually place 6-9 slices on one dish.\nOnce all the slices are in place, cover the dish and allow the collagen to set for 20 minutes. Some of the earliest placed collagen may already have started to dry out. To prevent this add a small amount of L15 to these before covering.\nOnce set, carefully add 2ml slice culture medium that has been equilibrated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for at least an hour. Care must be taken to not dislodge the collagen from the coverslip.\nPlace in a 37 °/ 5% CO2 incubator and allow slices to recover for at least 3 hours before imaging. If there is no humidity, place dish in a perspex box with a bit of damp tissue paper in one corner.\n5. Imaging Embryo Slices\nWe use a DeltaVision Core wide-field microscope fitted with a WeatherStation environmental chamber to image slices. The chamber is constantly maintained at 37 °C, with a CO2 perfusion apparatus to maintain the microscope stage at 5% CO2 / 95% air.",
    "Imaging is normally carried out using a 40 x / 1.30 NA oil immersion lens and images are captured with a CoolSnap HQ2 cooled CCD camera.\nZ-sections are captured every 1.5 μm through 45 μm tissue. Exposure time should be kept as low as possible. We normally expose for 5-50 ms for each Z-section. Images are captured every 7 minutes and up to 9 slices can be visited using the DeltaVision system's precise point visiting function.\n6. Representative Results\nAn example time-lapse sequence of a spinal cord progenitor cell is shown in Fig. 2a and corresponding Movie 1. Imaging was started on a spinal cord slice from a two-day-old (HH stage 12) embryo. This cell was transfected with a construct expressing GFP-αTubulin. During this early stage, neural progenitor cells undergo predominantly progenitor-progenitor mode divisions during which the cells divide to generate two further cycling progenitor cells. Fig. 2b and corresponding Movie 2 shows a cell transfected with GFP-GPI (GPI anchored GFP), marking the cell membrane. This cell undergoes a division during which the basal process splits into two and is equally inherited by the daughter cells.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3920/3920fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.
