    "1. OpenProt database download\nNOTE: Custom databases based on RNA-seq data for example can also be obtained and the procedure is detailed in the second section of this protocol. If a custom database is needed, please skip to the next section.\nGo to the OpenProt website: www.openprot.org and open the Downloads page using the link from the top page menu.\nClick on the species of interest based on the analyzed experimental data.\nClick on the protein type desired.\n\tNOTE: OpenProt offers three classifications: RefProt, Isoforms and AltProt. As shown in Figure 1, this parameter will vary based on the research objective.\n\t\nClick on RefProt alone to generate files containing only known proteins.\nClick on AltProt and Isoforms to generate files containing only novel proteins - either novel isoforms of known proteins (Isoforms) or coded by an alternative ORF (AltProts). Please note that OpenProt enforces a minimum ORF length of 30 codons15.\nClick on AltProts, Isoforms and RefProts to generate files containing all protein types present in the OpenProt database - known and novel proteins.\nIf available, click on the annotation from which protein sequences are drawn.\n\tNOTE: OpenProt offers a more exhaustive proteomic landscape by combining multiple annotations. Transcriptome annotations have a minimal overlap; thus, the selected annotation can substantially affect the visualized proteomic profile15,23.\nClick on the level of supporting evidence necessary for protein consideration. As shown in Figure 1, this parameter will vary based on the research objective.\n\t\nClick on minimum of two unique peptides detected to generate files containing only the most confident proteins.\n\t\tNOTE: A criterion of two unique peptides is currently considered a gold standard in proteomics for protein expression. If the experimental aim is to detect known and well-supported proteins, the use of this parameter is recommended.",
    "Click on minimum of one unique peptides detected to generate files containing proteins that have already been seen at least once among the mass spectrometry experiments re-analyzed by OpenProt.\n\t\tNOTE: This allows for consideration of the shorter length of AltProts and the probability that some of them may contain only one unique tryptic peptide8,11.\nClick on all predicted to generate files containing all of OpenProt predictions.\n\t\tNOTE: This setting is recommended only if the experimental aim is to discover novel proteins (Figure 1). The subsequent substantial increase in the search space calls for an adapted analysis pipeline as discussed below7,15.\nClick on the desired file format to download. For proteomic analyses, choose the Fasta (protein) file. The readme file contains all necessary information on the file format.\n2. Custom OpenProt database download\nNOTE: This section details how to obtain a custom database. If no custom database is needed, skip to the next section.\nGo to the OpenProt website (www.openprot.org) and open the Search page using the link from the top page menu.\nClick on the species of interest based on the experimental data analyzed.\nEnter a list of genes or transcripts of interest.\n\t\nWhen using a list of genes, enter it in the Gene query box.\nWhen using a list of transcripts, enter it in the Transcript query box.\nTick any box that applies to the desired database.\n\t\nDo not click on any box to obtain a table containing all types of protein supported by OpenProt: RefProt, Isoforms and AltProts.\nClick on Show only proteins with experimental evidence to obtain a table containing all types of proteins (RefProts, Isoforms and AltProts) that have been detected at least once by MS and/or for which translation evidence has been collected from ribosome profiling data.",
    "Similarly, click on Show only proteins detected by MS or on Show only proteins detected by ribosome profiling to obtain a table containing all types of proteins that have been detected at least once by MS or by ribosome profiling respectively.\nClick on Show only AltProts or on Show only isoforms to obtain a table containing only AltProts or only Isoforms respectively.\nClick on both Show only AltProts and Show only Isoforms to obtain a table containing both types of proteins.\n\t\tNOTE: All combinations of filters are possible.\nOnce all desired parameters are set, click on Search. The table output will appear below the search query fields.\nClick on the Download Fasta button at the right top corner of the output table. This will generate a Fasta file containing all proteins resulting from the queried list of genes or transcripts.\nPlease note that for computational reasons, OpenProt holds a maximum of 2,000 elements to be queried (genes or transcripts) at a time. In the event of a list above that limit, several fasta can be generated and then concatenated (as detailed below); or simply download the whole OpenProt database and filter the obtained file as desired.\n\t\nBin the whole list of genes or transcripts into sub-lists of 2,000 entries or less. For each sub-list, download a Fasta file as described above (step 3.3 to 3.6).\nLog in to the European Galaxy instance (or any other instance where proteomics tools are available), https://usegalaxy.eu/.\nCreate a new history and import all of the downloaded OpenProt databases (one per sub-list of genes or transcripts) by clicking on the upload logo at the left top of the screen.",
    "Use the Fasta Merge Files and Filter Unique Sequences tool developed by the GalaxyP developers (https://github.com/galaxyproteomics/). Select the Merge all Fasta option and input all of the imported OpenProt databases.\n\t\tNOTE: Each tool can be searched by using the query box on the left side of the screen\nSelect the accession only option to assess sequence unicity and copy the OpenProt identifier parse rule (>(.*)\\|), then click on Execute.\nNote that all files have been concatenated into a unique Fasta file with no redundancy that now appears in the history panel on the right side of the screen. This constitutes the working database.\n3. Database handling\nNOTE: From now on, the Galaxy platform will be used, but the same principles can be applied to other proteomic software.\nLog in to the European Galaxy instance (or any other instance where proteomics tools are available), https://usegalaxy.eu/.\nCreate a new history and import the downloaded OpenProt database by clicking on the upload logo at the left top of the screen.\nGo to the workflow page and import the Database Handling workflow (Supplementary Material S1) by clicking on the upload logo at the left top of the middle panel.\nClick on Run the workflow and select the imported OpenProt database as input.\n\tNOTE: This workflow will append the CRAPome repository to the OpenProt fasta and generate decoy sequences (reverse sequences)24. If a shuffle decoy list is desired, it can be done by changing this parameter on the DecoyDatabase tool.\nRename the obtained Fasta file to something meaningful. The database is ready to be used for proteomics analyses.\n4. Mass spectrometry file preparation\nNOTE: Most of the proteomics tools available on Galaxy instances use the mzML format, and peptide search engines prefer data in centroid mode.",
    "Open the freely available MSConvert tool from the ProteoWizard suite and upload the data file to be analyzed25.\nChoose the directory for the output and the desired file format to mzML.\nSet a peak picking filter using the wavelet based algorithm (CWT) on MS1 and MS2 levels, and start the conversion26.\n5. Peptide and protein identification/quantification\nNOTE: This part of the pipeline uses tools from the OpenMS suite, a versatile and easy-to-use framework18.\nLog in to the European Galaxy instance (or any other instance where proteomics tools are available), https://usegalaxy.eu/.\nCreate a new history and transfer the previously created database (step 3.5) to this new history with a drag-and-drop.\nImport the transformed mzML data file (step 4.3) by clicking on the Upload logo at the left top of the screen.\nGo to the workflow page and import the desired workflow by clicking on the upload logo at the left top of the middle panel.\n\tNOTE: MS experiments are differently designed based on the desired final output. Workflows are provided here for two frequent designs: protein identification and protein quantification based on stable isotope labeling (SIL). However, the Galaxy instance contains many other tools that will support other types of proteomic analyses27,28.\n\t\nFor a protein identification design, import the workflow provided in Supplementary Material S2. When using this workflow, please do not use the zlip compression when converting your files (step 4.2)\nFor a protein quantification based on stable isotope labeling design, import the workflow provided in Supplementary Material S3.\nSelect run the workflow and review the different parameters.\n\t\nSelect the imported mzML data file as input, and the previously created database (step 3.5) as the database Fasta file.",
    "Since the workflow uses the X!Tandem search engine, import the X!Tandem default configuration file (provided in Supplementary Material S4)29 by clicking on the upload logo at the left top of the screen.\nThe workflow uses multiple search engines (MS-GF+ and X!Tandem). Append other search engines or choose a single one simply by adding or removing the tools from the workflow30,31.\n\t\tNOTE: Using multiple search engines is recommended as it increases sensibility and sensitivity of the analysis32.\nIn order to account for the substantial increase in size when using the whole OpenProt database, use a stringent FDR15. By default, the provided workflow is set for a 0.001% FDR, adequate for the use of the whole OpenProt database. For other databases, this can be edited to any desired value.\n\t\tNOTE: Be sure to adapt the parameters of the different tools depending on the mass spectrometer used and the experimental protocol (precursor ion and fragment error, fixed and variable modifications, used enzyme, etc.).\nOptionally, download output for each step of the workflow for storage or quality control analysis by clicking on the chosen step from the history panel, then clicking on the Save logo that will appear underneath.\n6. Quality control\nNOTE: Because MS-based proteomics is the result of a complex process where each step needs to be optimized to produce reproducible results, quality control is a necessary procedure in the workflow33.\nSeveral metrics are common benchmark of performance, such as the number of peptide-spectrum matches (PSM), the number of identified peptides and proteins. Run the File Info tool on the IDFilter output (indicated in green in Figure 2) to provide such metrics.",
    "Although not applicable to every identification, especially with large datasets, reports of novel proteins should always be carefully evaluated. Inspection of the protein score, the sequence coverage, and the spectra supporting the finding is of vital importance. Use the TOPPview tool from the OpenMS framework to do this; it is freely available and well documented18,34,35.\n7. OpenProt database mining\nNOTE: Once a confident identification of a novel protein predicted by OpenProt (accession numbers starting with IP_ for AltProts and II_ for novel Isoforms) has been made, more biological information can be gathered from the OpenProt website15.\nGo to the OpenProt website: www.openprot.org and open the Search page using the link at the top page menu. \nClick on the species of interest (same as the one in which the protein was identified) and enter the protein accession number in the Protein query box.\nClick on search and a table containing basic information on the queried protein will appear. The table features: the protein length (in amino acid), its molecular weight (kDa) and isoelectric point, supporting experimental evidence by MS or ribosome profiling (Translation Evidence, TE), and functional predictions such as predicted domains and protein orthology (across the 10 species supported by OpenProt, v1.3). The table also contains information about the related gene and transcript and the localization of the protein within the transcript.\nClick on the Details link to gather further information. The newly opened page contains a genome browser which is centered on the queried protein, and information such as the genomic and transcriptomic coordinates and the presence of a Kozak or high-efficiency translation initiation site (TIS) motif36,37.\nClick on the Protein or DNA links from the info tab, to obtain protein or DNA sequences respectively.",
