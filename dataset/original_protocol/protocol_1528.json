    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTissue lysis: If starting material is cells, not tissue, skip this and proceed to next section\nTiming: 1–2 h hands-on, then 18 h incubation. Begin the protocol in the late afternoon so the 18 h incubation can be scheduled overnight.\nNote: If working with tissues, proceed through this section, if working with cells, skip to the “cell lysis and thawing” section below.\nWhen working with tissues, clean forceps by soaking in 70% EtOH for 5 min followed by a rinse in 1× PBS or use disposable sterile forceps.\nWarm complete cell culture medium to 37°C, 5 mL per sample and put 5 mL of warmed medium in a petri dish or well of a 6-well plate. For vaginal, cervical and rectal tissues, we recommend complete RPMI medium: RPMI medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% L-glutamine and 1% pen-strep. Please see the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] for catalog numbers for these items. If you are attempting this protocol with a different type of tissue, we a recommend using the same medium as would be used for culture or short-term transport of the tissues.\nFor each sample, label and weigh an empty 1.5–2 mL tube and record the weights.\nIf the tissues are dry frozen:\nGet dry ice to store replicate samples if you are working with >1\nUsing forceps, remove the tissue from the tube and place in the medium to thaw\nIf the tissues are cryopreserved:\nGet dry ice to store replicate samples if you are working with >1 at a time.\nPlace the cryovial in a 37°C water bath and thaw until a small (e.g., 3×3×3 mm) piece of ice is left.\nUsing forceps, remove the tissue and place into the warmed medium.",
    "Leave the tissue in the warm medium for 5 min to remove the cryo-preservative.\nBlot the tissue on a lint-free laboratory wipe to remove excess liquid clinging to the surface.\nPut the tissue in the pre-weighed tube and weigh the tube again. Calculate the tissue weight by subtracting the weight of the empty tube.\nIf the tissue is ≥ 7 mg, trim until it is < 7 mg using a sterile scalpel or razor blade. Pieces > 7 mg will likely not digest well with this protocol. Individual samples can be split into multiple tubes and recombined later.\nAdd 180 μL buffer ATL to each tube, making sure that the tissue is submerged in the buffer.\nAdd 20 μL 20 mg/mL proteinase K to the tube.\nMix by pulse-vortexing for 15 s. It is important that the proteinase K is well mixed into the solution.\nPlace the tube in the heat block and incubate without shaking at 56°C for at least 18 h until the sample is completely lysed.\nIf possible, check the digestion after a few hours to see how it has progressed. As the tissue digests the original piece will dissolve and no longer be recognizable as a solid chunk. Depending on tissue type, a shorter incubation may be possible for complete digestion/lysis.\nAfter 18 h of incubation, gently invert the tube and visually inspect to see if tissue has fully digested.\nIt is useful to hold the tube up to a dark surface to see if there are remaining light-colored undigested tissue pieces floating in the tube.\nIf sample is completely dissolved, proceed to genomic DNA (gDNA) isolation.",
    "If sample has not fully lysed (e.g., tissue is still intact, or there is visible material in suspension), repeat proteinase K addition as described above and return samples to heat block. Check after a few hours or up to 18 h (this long incubation can be performed overnight) until the tissue is digested completely. If the tissue does not digest, the piece of tissue may have been too large.\nOnce the tissue is lysed, proceed to gDNA extraction\nCell thawing and lysis (if starting material is cells, not tissue)\nTiming: 1–2 h depending on number of samples and if isolating CD4+ cells\nThaw cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs) or CD4+ T cells into 37°C complete culture medium.\nSpin cells for 10 min at 500 × g to pellet the thawed cells so that the cryopreservative can be removed.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend cells in an appropriate volume for counting.\nCount total cells, or, if not already done, isolate CD4+ T cells using the EasySep™ Human CD4+ T Cell Isolation Kit (StemCell 17952) or your preferred method, then count the cells.\nCounting may be performed manually with a hemocytometer or with an automated cell counter. Once a method is chosen, it should be used for all samples going forward to avoid batch to batch differences.\nIf cells are counted manually, a minimum of 200 cells should be counted on each side of the hemocytometer to ensure an accurate count.\nIf an automated cell counter is used, make sure that the instrument has been calibrated to the company’s specifications and any necessary quality control and cleaning steps have been performed prior to counting the experimental sample.",
    "Note: that while we recommend isolating CD4+ T cells when possible, this method can work on samples in which CD4+ T cell separation is not ideal such as cells frozen without cryopreservation.\nTransfer up to 2 × 106 cells to a 2 mL conical tube (ex. “Eppendorf”). Samples with more cells should be split and processed separately.\nNote: Check the centrifuge rating for the tubes and do not spin above this speed as the tubes may crack.\nPellet cells by spinning at 2,400 × g in a benchtop centrifuge for 5 min.\nRemove supernatant and discard into 10% bleach by pipetting.\nUsing wide-bore filter tips, resuspend the pellet in 100 μL of 3M guanidine HCl\nIf wide-bore tips are not available, use sterile scissors or a sterile razor blade to cut 2–3mm from the narrow end of a regular bore tip. This will leave a wider orifice like in a commercially sourced wide-bore tip.\nCritical: Pipette gently using wide-bore filter tips to avoid shearing the DNA.\nAdd 20 μL of 20 mg/mL proteinase K.\nInvert gently five times to mix thoroughly. It is important to mix gently to avoid shearing the DNA.\nIncubate at 56°C for 1 h. During this time, put the 6M guanidine isothiocyanate in 37°C water bath or incubator to dissolve any precipitates. Vortex occasionally to help the crystals dissolve.\nProceed to gDNA extraction.\ngDNA extraction\nTiming: 30 min for one sample, more time is needed with additional samples\nCritical: Dispose of guanidinium salts as chemical waste according to your facility’s rules. Do not mix with bleach, do not pour down drain.",
    "Note: This step includes the initial extraction of gDNA using guanidine salts, precipitation and washing with 70% ethanol. At this step, cell samples will contain 20 μL of Guanidine HCl (GuHcl) and 20 μL of 20 mg/mL proteinase K (Wiegand et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). Tissue samples will contain 180 μL of buffer ATL and 20 μL of 20 mg/mL proteinase K.\nAdd 400 μL 6M guanidine isothiocyanate to the sample tube.\nMix :\nFor a cell sample, mix by pipetting with wide-bore filter tips.\nFor a tissue sample, invert the tube several times (pipette tips may clog).\nIncubate at 56°C for 10 min.\nAdd 1 mL of 100% molecular grade isopropanol.\nNote: Isopropanol should be at about 25°C, cold temperatures will cause more contaminating salts to precipitate out with the DNA.\nInvert the tube 10 times to mix.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at the maximum speed (e.g., 21,000 × g) your tubes are rated for.\nPipet off most of the supernatant, leaving ∼100 μL behind.\nDispose of the supernatant according to your facility’s procedures for guanidine.\nAdd 1 mL of 70% ethanol to wash the pellet.\nInvert the tube 10 times to mix.\nCentrifuge 1 min at maximum speed.\nCompletely remove the supernatant with a pipette.\nSpin down briefly with a micro benchtop centrifuge and remove any remaining liquid with a 20 μL pipette tip.\nAir dry 5–10 min (lid open) on bench, in fume hood or biosafety cabinet. The pellet may be mostly clear or an opaque white color when it is still saturated with ethanol. Due to the viscosity of the high molecular weight DNA, the precipitated salts may spread into a “smear” on the side of the tube rather than a tight pellet. This is not a problem.",
    "Check that the precipitate appears dry and crystalline and that there is no odor of ethanol. If it appears wet and/or there is an odor, continue drying until it meets the criteria above.\nAdd 300 μL buffer EB and vortex 5 s.\nIncubate at 60°C for 1 h to dissolve the pellet.\nNote: The extracted nucleic acid will be high molecular weight at this point in the protocol and will therefore be much more viscous than nucleic acid extracted over a column or with intentional shearing. Avoid pipetting, vortexing, or freezing the sample at this point in the protocol: the goal is to maintain as much intactness as possible. All required fragmentation is achieved through restriction enzyme digestion at the next step. It is not necessary to attempt to quantify the DNA at this point in the protocol, it will likely be inaccurate due to the viscosity of the material.\nRestriction enzyme digestion\nTiming: 20 min hands-on, 19 h incubation\nIn this step, the restriction enzyme BglI (New England Biolabs, Cat# R0143S) is used to digest the high molecular weight nucleic acid isolated in the previous step. This enzyme was specifically chosen because it has cut sites throughout the human genome whereas most proviral genomes do not contain any BglI cut sites. The high molecular weight extraction followed by this specific enzyme digestion allows controlled fragmentation of the genomic DNA. Instructions for preparing an HIV negative control sample from commercially sourced human genomic DNA are in the preparation section above.\nNote: If there are multiple samples to be digested, make a master mix of 10× NEBuffer 3.1 and NEB BglI with the volumes described below and aliquot 48.2 ul into each sample.\nBring 10× NEBuffer 3.1 to ambient temperature.",
    "If salts have precipitated in the buffer, place in a 37°C incubator or water bath for about 5 min, then vortex, to dissolve the precipitates.\nAdd 35 μL 10× NEBuffer 3.1 to the sample (which is already suspended in 300 μL buffer EB).\nAdd 13.2 μL NEB BglI enzyme (132 units).\nInvert a few times to mix.\nPut samples in the Thermomixer C using SmartBlock 1.5 mL with the lowest shaking speed and incubate overnight (16–18 h) at 37°C.\nNote: 300 RPM is the lowest shaking speed for all blocks that fit in the Thermomixer C.\nPause point: Overnight incubation 16–18 h.\nAfter 16–18 h incubation, add 5 μL more BglI and incubate at 37°C for 1 h in the thermomixer at the lowest speed, which is approximately 300 RPM.\nEtOH precipitation of BglI-digested samples\nGet wet ice in a suitably sized ice bucket for the number of samples you have.\nPut 70% and 100% ethanol on dry ice or in a freezer to cool. These reagents do not need to reach a certain temperature; the cooling is only for making the precipitation more efficient. Salts precipitate more at colder temperatures.\nSet a heat block for 65°C\nAdd 35 μL of 3M sodium acetate (bringing the solution to 0.3M sodium acetate) to the tubes containing the BglI-digested samples.\nAdd 766 μL of ice-cold 100% ethanol and mix the solution by inverting.\nPlace the tube on wet ice for 30 min.\nCentrifuge at maximum speed (e.g., 21,000 × g) your tubes are rated for 10 min.\nCarefully pipette off the supernatant down to 50–100 μL residual volume.\nAdd 1 mL of 70% ethanol and centrifuge at maximum speed for 2 min.\nSpin down briefly with a micro benchtop centrifuge and remove any remaining liquid with a 20 μL pipette tip.",
    "Air dry 5–10 min (lid open)\nCritical: The pellet of precipitated nucleic acid must be free of any remaining alcohol.\nAdd 50 μL of buffer EB to the pellet and allow it to dissolve 1 h at 65°C, then leave up to overnight at room temperature, about 25°C.\nIf the gDNA is still viscous, repeat the restriction enzyme digestion and EtOH precipitation.\nQuantify concentration and dilute\nTiming: Depends on number of samples, at least 15 min\nMeasure the concentration of the gDNA with a NanoDrop or other spectrophotometer.\nIf the gDNA is >200 ng/μL and <300 ng/ul after the EtOH precipitation, dilute with Qiagen Buffer EB to a maximum of 200 ng/μL for the HIV assays. If the gDNA is >300 ng/ul, repeat BglI digestion.\nPrepare at least 20 μL of 1:100 diluted gDNA in Qiagen Buffer EB or molecular grade water. This will be used for the two replicate wells of the reference assay.\nCritical: The values from the reference assay are used to make inferences about the concentrations in the HIV assay wells. Therefore, it is important to prepare the 1:100 dilution accurately. To minimize error, use a minimum of 5 μL stock template and 495 μL buffer EB.\nStore the gDNA at 4°C until ready to proceed with ddPCR.\nAdd reagents to plates and generate droplets\nTiming: Depends on number of samples, at least 20 min\nGet out two new twin-tec ddPCR 96–well plates, one for the master mix and DNA and one to receive the droplets once they are formed in the droplet generator.\nEach well will receive a total of 22 μL before droplet generation: 17 μL of master mix and 5 μL of template. First prepare the master mix:",
    "For a single well, the master mix consists of 11 μL of 2× supermix and 3 μL of the assay pool (either the assay 1, assay 2 or RPP30_deltaD assay pools described above) and 3 μL of molecular grade water. Prepare enough master mix for the number of wells you are running plus 10% overage.\nAdd 17 μL of master mix (supermix + assay pool + water) per well\nFill the plate column-wise to save on droplet generator consumables\nIf there are any columns that don’t have master mix in all 8 wells, add 22 μL of 2× ddPCR Buffer Control for Probes to the empty wells in those columns.\nGently tap the plate on the bench to bring reagents to the bottom of the wells.\nSeal the plate with an adhesive plate seal to prevent contamination if you are not immediately adding template DNA or need to move to the plate to another area.\nAdd template DNA and plasmid control samples to plate\nAdd 5 μL template to the wells according to the plate layout: the HIV assays should be run in triplicate and the reference assays run in duplicate (see NOTE). We suggest that for each column, wells A, B and C are used for HIV assay1, D, E and F are used for HIV assay2 and wells G and H are used for the reference assay. An example plate layout is available in spreadsheet form in the supplemental folder “Data S1”. The file is called “05162019_PTID1031_plate_layout_CL.csv”",
    "Note: If the sample has very low levels of integrated provirus, it may be necessary to survey a larger volume of sample to pick up this rare signal. If this is suspected, we suggest increasing the number of replicates of the HIV assay wells so that a larger amount of DNA can be assayed.\nAdd undiluted gDNA to the HIV assay wells.\nCritical: DNA used for the ddPCR template should have a maximum concentration of 200 ng/μL. A higher concentration will interfere with droplet formation.\nAdd diluted template to the RRP30_deltaD assay wells: undiluted template will likely lead to an oversaturated signal (all droplets positive) and an underestimate of DNA shearing.\nFor experimental (derived from a study participant as opposed to a plasmid control or other artificially prepared sample) samples, dilute the gDNA 1:100 with Qiagen Buffer EB.\nFor the plasmid/HIV-negative gating controls, dilute 1:2 with Qiagen Buffer EB.\nNote: This dilution may need to be adjusted due to batch to batch variation in plasmid controls or degradation of the controls over time. The goal is to have enough positive droplets for clear populations and this will vary from batch to batch of controls.\nApply the foil seal to the plate with the auto sealer and invert the plate several times to thoroughly mix the master mix and DNA in the plate.\nSpin down the plate to bring all liquid to the bottom of the wells.\nCritical: Check for bubbles on the bottom of the wells. Spin again if you see any. Bubbles on top are ok. Bubbles on the bottom will interfere with droplet generation by the autoDG.\nGenerate droplets\nTiming: Up to 35 min, or less if entire plate is not used\nNote: See the autoDG manual for details on use: https://www.bio-rad.com/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/10043138.pdf[href=https://www.bio-rad.com/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/10043138.pdf]",
    "Assemble the autoDG (droplet generator) with cartridge, tips, template plate and empty plate (where the newly generated droplets will go) in their appropriate locations.\nConfigure the wells on the autoDG and initiate droplet generation.\nWhen the droplets are done, heat seal the droplet plate with a pierce-able foil seal with auto sealer and dispose of the plate that held the master mix and DNA.\nObserve wells for any abnormalities in droplet formation: there should be a uniform opaque layer at the top of each well.\nThermal cycling (PCR)\nTiming: about 2.5 h\nTransfer the droplets plate to the thermal-cycler and run the ddPCR protocol. The ramp rate should be 2°C for all steps. The run volume is 40 μL per well.\nCritical: The plate must be completely sealed around all the edges to avoid evaporation during PCR cycling.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1097_9.csv\nPause point: After the cycling is complete, the plate can be stored overnight (12–18 h) at 4°C before reading the droplets.\nRead droplets\nTiming: 1–2 min per well, 2 h for an entire 96-well plate.\nWhen the PCR reaction is done, take the plate to the droplet reader, put the plate in the holder, and clamp it down.\nFill out the plate info in the QuantaSoft software.\nHighlight the wells that you are going to read.\nSupermix is ddPCR supermix for probes (no dUTP).\nAssign channel 1 and channel 2 to unknowns.\nClick run plate, then save the template file.\nChoose the FAM/HEX dye set.\nWait until the first well starts to make sure there are no issues initiating the reading."
