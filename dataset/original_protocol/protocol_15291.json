    "1. Prepare Fresh Working Solutions\nTBS: 0.05 M Tris Buffered Saline, pH 7.8 (TBS). Prepare 60 ml TBS/microplate.\nPPE: Porcine pancreatic elastase, type 1 (PPE) is provided as a suspension. Shake well and dilute PPE in TBS to approximately 0.01 U/ml. Prepare 6 ml working solution/microplate).\nSA3NA: Succinyl-L-Ala-L-Ala-L-Ala-p-nitroanilide (SA3NA). Prepare 0.1 M stock SA3NA solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and use immediately or store at -20 °C. Prepare 6ml working solution/microplate by diluting stock SA3NA solution 1/100 in TBS.\nCOOMASSIE BLUE: Prepare a stock solution of 10% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Coomassie Blue) in TBS and use immediately or store at -20 °C. Prepare 6 ml working solution by diluting stock solution 1/1000 in TBS.\n2. Prepare Saliva\nSALIVA COLLECTION: In the standing position, stimulate serum exudation into saliva by placing a sialogogue such as citric acid or chewing gum in the mouth. A sugar-free lemon drop is convenient for HIV-1 patients who are frequently edentulous and unable to chew gum. Swallow as needed for the first 3 min, and collect whole mouth saliva into a capped cup for the next 3 min. This will provide approximately 2 ml of saliva. Use immediately or store at -80 °C.\nSALIVA HANDLING: If frozen, thaw specimen at 37 °C and place on ice. Store fresh or thawed specimen at 2-4 °C no more than 3 days. Do not vortex saliva and avoid pipetting mucin which contains no serum exudate. Use Standard Precautions when handling saliva http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/isolation/Isolation2007.pdf[href=http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/isolation/Isolation2007.pdf] .\n3. Microplate Set-up\nBUFFER: Measurements are performed in triplicate. To each well of a microtiter plate is added 130 μL TBS.\nSPECIMENS: To each test well, is added 20 μL saliva for a final volume of 150 μl/well. Mix by pipetting without introducing bubbles.",
    "CONTROLS: The positive control contains PPE, but no saliva. The negative control contains saliva, but no PPE.To the positive control well is added 20 μL TBS. To the negative control well is added 20 μL saliva.\nPPE INCUBATION: Shake PPE working solution well. Add 50 μL PPE working solution to each well excluding the negative control wells. To the negative control wells, add 50 μL TBS. Incubate 10 min at 23 °C.\nSUBSTRATE INCUBATION: Add 50 μL SA3NA working solution to each well. Incubate 45 min at 23 °C.\nCOOMASSIE BLUE: Add 50 μL Coomassie Blue working solution.\nREAD-OUT: Read absorbance in microplate reader, A405 nm to detect SA3NA cleavage which represents active α1PI and A595 nm to detect Coomassie Blue which represents protein content.\n4. Calculate α1PI Index\nNORMALIZE THE AVERAGE A405 nm AND A595 nm: For each triplicate, calculate the average. Subtract the Negative Control average from the Specimen average. To minimize plate-to-plate variation, normalize the averages by dividing each Specimen average by the Positive control average as follows:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3999/3999eq1.jpg\nCALCULATE THE α1PI INEX: Divide the normalized A405 nm by the normalized A595 nm:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3999/3999eq2.jpg\n5. Representative Results\nTo determine whether the α-test might be suitable for use as a point-of-care screening test to monitor CD4 counts in endemic, resource-limited regions, stimulated saliva was collected from 20 female and 11 male HIV-1 subjects attending clinic for routine care in Cameroon. Consistent with preliminary observations during development of the α-test using saliva collected in New York City, the α1PI Index in saliva collected in Cameroon correlated with CD4 counts (r2=0.91, p<0.0001. n=31). The relationship was defined by a 3-parameter sigmoidal curve which is consistent with a dose-response relationship (Figure 2A). The 95% confidence and prediction intervals are depicted with blue and red lines, respectively (Figure 2B).",
    "In a previous study, we determined that CD4+ T cells exhibit sinusoidal cycling with periodicity 23±3.5 days in HIV-1 subjects and in subjects with the inherited version of α1PI deficiency (PIZZ)3. Depicted herein is a representative example of computer-generated sine curve analysis of CD4 cycling in a non-HIV-1 healthy control exhibiting 27 day periodicity (Figure 3A).\nComputer-generated sine curve analysis of the CD4+ T cell changes in 6 subjects yielded values for peak-to-peak amplitude and axis of oscillation3. As would be expected, the axis of oscillation was correlated with amplitude (r2=0.96, p=0.009, n=6) (Figure 3B). In patients will low CD4 T+ cell counts, the cyclic changes in CD4 T cell count were small, and in patients with high CD4+ T cell counts, cyclic changes were large.\nBecause the regression line depicted in Figure 2 estimates the axis of oscillation and the axis of oscillation is correlated with amplitude, amplitude can be calculated for the regression line thereby estimating how far above and below the regression line CD4+ T cells would be expected to vary due to cycling (Figure 3C). Overlaying the amplitude calculated in Figure 3C and the confidence interval calculated in Figure 2B, it was found that amplitude (green line) lies within the 95% the confidence interval (blue line) (Figure 3D).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3999/3999fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Procedure Summary: Place citric acid in mouth and collect saliva. Add diluted saliva to wells of a microplate in triplicate. Add PPE to each well and incubate for 15 min at 23 °C. Add the PPE substrate to each well and incubate for 45 min at 23 °C. Add Coomassie Blue and read at 405 nm to detect PPE activity and at 595 nm to detect protein.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3999/3999fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2. Comparison of the α-test with the standard CD4 enumeration method. A) The α-test was performed by quantitating the α1PI Index in stimulated whole mouth saliva. CD4 counts were performed by an independent medical laboratory using standard flow cytometry. Blood for flow cytometry and saliva were collected at the same clinic visit. The relationship between the α1PI Index and CD4 counts was defined by a 3-parameter sigmoidal curve (r2=0.91, p<0.0001, n=31). B) The 95% confidence and prediction intervals are depicted in blue and red lines, respectively.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3999/3999fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Accuracy of calculating CD4 counts using the α1PI Index. A) CD4+ T cells exhibited sinusoidal cycling with 27 day periodicity in a non-HIV-1 healthy control. The axis of oscillation is depicted (red dotted line). B) Computer generated sine wave analysis of CD4 T cell cycling was used to calculate the peak-to-peak amplitude and axis of oscillation in 4 HIV-1 subjects, 1 non-HIV-1 PIzz subject, and the non-HIV-1 healthy control depicted in part A. The relationship between CD4 T+ cell amplitude and axis of oscillation was defined by 3-parameter sigmoidal curve (r2=0.96, p=0.009, n=6). C) The sigmoidal relationship between amplitude and axis of oscillation derived in part B) was used to calculate the expected amplitude (green lines) of points along the regression line (black line) from Figure 2. D) The expected amplitude interval (green lines) was significantly different from the 95% confidence interval (blue lines) as determined by the Mann Whitney Rank Sum Test (based on a comparison of the median difference between the 95% confidence interval and regression line (63 cells/μl) and the median difference between the amplitude line and regression line (37 cells/μl); p=0.001).Subscription Required.
