    "All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act and the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. Healthy female BALB/c mice, ~6-8 weeks old, were administered the dry powder content of one dosator by intrapulmonary aerosol delivery for a pharmacokinetic study using spectinamide 1599 dry powders9. The animals were obtained from a commercial source (see Table of Materials).\n1. Preparation of the dosator and the filling components\nTrim the plastic luer portion of a 2.54 cm (1 inch) blunt stainless-steel needle (21-25 G) using either a precision sectioning saw (see Table of Materials), or a belt sander until 2-3 mm of the plastic luer remains (Figure 1A and Figure 2A).\n\tNOTE: If a belt sander is used, the stainless-steel needle may need to be cleaned using a smaller needle or wire to remove the possible obstructions created.\nCut off the tip (1-1.5 cm) of a 0.6 mL conical centrifuge tube. Fill the tip of the tube with 30-35 mg of powder.\n\tâ€‹NOTE: See Representative Results for the details of the example powders used for the present study. The powder aerosol performance should be evaluated prior to use in this application following standard methodology as described in USP General Chapter <601> (see Table of Materials).\nIf storing and/or transporting the powder, use the tube cap (cut off) to close the vial. Seal with paraffin film to minimize powder exposure to ambient moisture if storing and/or transporting.\n2. Loading and assembling dosators",
    "Tamp the trimmed stainless-steel needle into the powder bed in the 0.6 mL conical centrifuge tube tip as many times as needed to achieve the desired dose (Figure 2B). Gently wipe the sides of the stainless-steel needle with a low-lint wiper to remove any excess powder (Figure 3).\nGently insert the loaded stainless-steel needle into a 3.81 cm (1.5 inch) polypropylene or 5.08 cm (2 inch) polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) needle (16-20 G) (see Table of Materials) to avoid dislodging any powder (Figure 1B,C and Figure 2C).\n3. Actuating dosators\nDraw back a disposable syringe to the desired volume, which may vary based on application.\n\tNOTE: For intrapulmonary administration in mice, 0.15-0.6 mL is typically appropriate8,9.\nAttach the syringe to the luer lock on the polypropylene or PTFE needle (Figure 2D).\nInsert the needle end of the dosator into the desired target. For analyzing powder content and reproducibility, insert the needle through a perforated rubber septum or paraffin film into a vial containing a small amount (e.g., 1-5 mL) of water and/or organic solvent (e.g., ethanol), with solvent identity and volume dependent on active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) physical characteristics and the quantification method.\n\t\nFor delivery to mice, insert the needle up to the first bronchial bifurcation of the trachea of anesthetized mice following established protocols9,15.\nDepress the syringe forcefully, expelling the powder out of the device into the collection vial (Figure 2E).\n\tNOTE: The same technique must be followed for delivering the powder to the murine lungs.\nFor analyzing content and reproducibility from the collection vial, utilize an appropriate analytical method for the specific API, such as UV-Visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometry or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).\nSubscription Required.
