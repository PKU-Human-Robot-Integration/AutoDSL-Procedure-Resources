    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Oregon Health and Science University.\n1. 2pFLIM Microscope Setup\nInstall a photon timing counting module (PTCM, Table of Materials) and connect to the computer (Figure 1) according to the manufacturer’s manual.\nNOTE: The PTCM is typically a computer board that receives a “sync” input for the laser pulse timing and a photon input from the photomultiplier tube (PMT). It also receives clock timing for pixels, lines, and frames, from two-photon imaging control software. The PTCM uses the clock signals to separate individual photons into different pixels and frames.\nAdd a photodiode with >200 MHz bandwidth to measure the laser timing. Place a standard glass coverslip in the light path to reflect a small fraction of the laser light into the photodiode placed perpendicular to the light path (Figure 1). Connect the photodiode output to the “sync” input of the PTCM.\nNOTE: Many modern lasers also output the laser timing. For these lasers, the photodiode is not necessary, and one can directly connect the laser timing output to the sync input of the PTCM.\nExchange the PMT, in case of the tAKARα, the green channel PMT, with a low-noise, fast GaAsP PMT (Figure 1). Connect the PMT output to the signal input of the PTCM.\nAdd an optional signal splitter (Figure 1) if simultaneous acquisition of intensity through the conventional two-photon imaging channel is desired. Connect the PMT output to the signal splitter and connect the splitter output to the PTCM and the conventional two-photon imaging module.",
    "NOTE: GaAsP PMTs give faster single-photon signals than conventional bialkali PMTs and allow for a more precise determination of the photon timing. Certain models of GaAsP PMTs can be cooled to 10−35 °C below ambient temperature, allowing the suppression of dark counts to a level below a few hundred per second (typically ≤200 counts/s). This low noise level is important for the precise measurement of fluorescence lifetimes because noise photon counts cannot be easily distinguished or subtracted from the fluorescence lifetime curve.\nAdd a band-pass fluorescence emission filter that minimizes the spectral contamination, if any, from the acceptor fluorophore. For example, for tAKARα, a 500 nm ± 20 nm barrier filter for the green channel is used to reduce the contamination from the acceptor sREACh, which is a dark (QY ~0.07) yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)29,30. Connect timing signals, such as the clocks for individual image pixels, lines, and frames, as appropriate to the control software and described in the PTCM user manual. Install the appropriate data control and acquisition software.\nNOTE: Some PTCM manufacturers (Table of Materials) provide their software for 2pFLIM imaging. Here, custom software called FLIMimage is used, which was developed by the Yasuda Lab (Max Planck Florida, via personal communication). This software functions as an add-on user function to certain two-photon acquisition software (Table of Materials). It controls and communicates with the PTCM at the appropriate timing during two-photon imaging to acquire 2pFLIM images.\n2. Construction of a Motorized Treadmill\nNOTE: The design of the custom-built motorized treadmill is shown in Figure 2.",
    "Cut a foam roller (Ø = 200 mm) to 150 mm in length with a fine hacksaw. Alternatively, glue the two halves of a foam ball together and place tape over the seam. Optionally, glue a rubber mat with profile on the roller to increase traction on the roller.\nDrill a ¼ inch diameter hole through the center of the roller at the flat side of the roller or drill a ¼ inch diameter hole through the middle of each half of the ball if the foam ball is used.\nInstall a ¼ inch diameter steel axle through the hole. Glue the foam roller/ball to the axle using foam-compatible glue. Optionally, modify two flexible shaft couplings (¼ inch inner diameter) to strengthen the coupling of the axle to the foam roller/ball.\nNOTE: Please note that many common glues may dissolve foam.\n\t\nFor each shaft coupling, position the shaft coupling on its flat side and at the center of the rectangle metal plate (0.7 mm x 15 mm x 76 mm). Weld the plate to the shaft coupling. Drill a ¼ inch hole at the center of the plate to allow for installation of the modified shaft coupling on to the axle and two screw holes into the metal plate lateral from the center.\nInstall the shaft coupling onto the axle against the foam roller/ball. If using the latter, slightly bend the plate to fit the curvature of the ball. Place screws into the lateral holes to fix the roller/ball on the axle.",
    "Drill and tap a 3/8-32 thread at the center of a cage plate and install the rotary encoder. Drill a screw hole into the base of the right-angle motor bracket to allow attachment of the motor onto the post holder. Attach both the rotary encoder and the motor to the end of the axle using a flexible shaft coupling.\nInstall the assembled treadmill on an aluminum bread board using posts for the motor and rotary encoder (Figure 2). Connect the motor inputs to the speed controller, and the rotary encoder output to an analog input of the computer data acquisition (DAQ) board.\nNOTE: The rotation angular speed is encoded by the rotary encoder as voltage and is digitized using custom software called AnimalTracker written in MATLAB.\nInstall the headplate-compatible holder to a right-angle bracket. Install a solid post on the bread plate in front of the treadmill and install the assembled headplate holder with the right-angle bracket on the post (Figure 2). Ensure that the headplate holder bars are aligned with the axle such that the mouse can adopt an adequate and comfortable walking position on the treadmill (Figure 2C).\n3. Expression of tAKARα Sensor in the Mouse Cortex\nIn utero electroporation\nPrepare a DNA solution for IUE by adding 0.2% final concentration of fast green dye (for visualization during injection) to a plasmid DNA (3−4 µg/µL; the sensor constructs containing a CAG promotor, sensor sequence, and a woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional response element [WPRE] translational enhancer) dissolved/diluted in water or Tris-EDTA.",
    "Prepare a timed pregnant female mouse (e.g., C57BL/6) for IUE at E1624. Anesthetize the mouse with isoflurane (4% for induction and 1.5% for maintenance, on 95% O2 with 5% CO2) and apply subcutaneous injection of peri-operative analgesics containing 5 mg/kg Meloxicam and 4 mg/kg Bupivacaine. Cut open the abdominal cavity with a scalpel and a pair of scissors and carefully expose the uterine horns.\nInject 1 µL of DNA solution per embryo in the lateral ventricle of one hemisphere, as previously described24.\nPerform regular IUE24 for cortical neurons by placing the positive electrode end foot at the cortex and using five 100-ms square pulses (38 V) at 1 Hz with an electroporator.\n\t\tNOTE: Different cortical regions can be targeted for electroporation by changing the placement of the electrode end foot relative to the lateral ventricle.\nStereotaxic injection \nPrepare a mouse at postnatal day 30 for stereotaxic surgery26. Anesthetize the mouse as described in step 3.1.2., and apply subcutaneous injection of peri-operative analgesics containing 5 mg/kg Carprofen.\nDilute AAV serotype 2/1 (AAV2/1) expressing hSyn-tAKARα-WPRE to an empirically determined titer (~1 x 109−1 x 1010 genomes/µL) in syringe-filtered (0.2 µm cellulose acetate membrane) phosphate-buffered saline.\nDrill a ~500 μm diameter hole using a handheld drill under a stereomicroscope at the following coordinates for the motor cortex: 0.5 mm anterior to bregma, 1.2 mm lateral to midline.\nMount an injector (e.g., oil hydraulic manipulator, with custom-made plunger/glass pipette holder) to a motorized manipulator. Place the injection needle at a 15° angle relative to the bregma-lambda plane. Program a diagonal movement across the x- and z- axes equivalent to a 700 µm and 200 µm progression along the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes, respectively.",
    "​NOTE: To avoid damage to the tissue directly above the intended imaging field, AAV particles are injected at an angle relative to the bregma-lambda plane.\nPosition the tip of the injection needle at the pia in the center of the drill hole and slowly execute the diagonal movement (~25 µm/s) described above. This procedure will position the center of injection at 1.2 mm anterior to bregma, 1.2 mm lateral to midline, 0.2 mm below the pia.\nInject 20 nL of diluted viral particles (~10 nL/min). Wait at least 10 min and slowly retract the injection needle (~12.5 µm/s).\nFinish the stereotaxic injection procedure and glue/suture the skin26.\n4. Installation of the Cranial Window\nPerform the placement of the cranial window on mice expressing tAKARα via IUE (section 3.1) or stereotaxic injection of viral particles (section 3.2), between postnatal days 30 and 60. For mouse infected with viral particles, implement the cranial window at least two weeks after the virus injection. Install the cranial window as previously described27,28, with the following details. Anesthetize the mouse as described in step 3.1.2., and apply subcutaneous injection of peri-operative analgesics 0.075 mg/kg Buprenex and anti-inflammatory agent Dexamethasone at 4 mg/kg.\nRemove the periosteum and retract the neck muscle. Glue the edge of the skin to the skull with tissue adhesive to avoid exposure of the neck musculature after surgery.\nDry and remove any periosteum from the skull by gently scraping using a scalpel. Place the imaging headplate (8 mm inner diameter) to surround the intended imaging field. Glue the headplate to the skull using cyanoacrylate-based glue, followed by dental acrylic cement. For optimal adhesion, ensure that the headplate rests on the exposed and dried skull. Glue accelerator can be used to accelerate the hardening.",
    "Draw a circle of 5 mm in diameter above the intended imaging field (coordinates as specified in step 3.2.3) using a dental drill and expose the dura mater.\nApply a thin layer of transparent polymer, also called artificial dura, to the dura surface to cover the entire cranial window. The polymer will protect and stabilize the dura mater. Place a sterile circular coverslip (5 mm diameter) on the dura mater. Secure the coverslip with cyanoacrylate glue applied around the edges of the window followed by dental acrylic cement.\n5. In Vivo Two-photon Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy\nCommence 2pFLIM imaging at or beyond 2 weeks post-installation of the cranial window (section 4). Minimize experimental interference due to stress by frequent handling and scruffing of the mouse prior to the start of the imaging study to habituate the mouse.\nSet the two-photon excitation laser wavelength to 960 nm using the software that controls the two-photon laser.\nAnaesthetize the mouse using 4% isoflurane. Confirm proper anesthetization by tail-pinch and observing breathing rates. That is, there should be no response to the tail-pinch and the breathing rate should be reduced to ~1 breath per second. To minimize unnecessary procedural time and because the anesthesia lasts only for two to three minutes, eye lubricants are not used.\nTransfer the anaesthetized mouse to the motorized treadmill (Figure 2C) and mount the headplate of the mouse to the headplate holder of the treadmill setup (see Figure 2 for details). Clean the surface of the cranial window coverslip on the mouse with 70% ethanol.\nPlace the motorized treadmill with the mounted mouse under the 2pFLIM objective. Apply a drop of distilled water between the cranial window coverslip and the objective.",
    "Let the mounted mouse wake up from anesthesia and become acclimated to the treadmill and microscope environment for at least 10 min. Monitor respiration rate of the mouse while the mounted mouse wakes up from anesthesia.\nNavigate to the injection location under epi-illumination. Document fiducial features (i.e., blood vessels) under brightfield to aid imaging of the same region of interest (ROI) during subsequent imaging sessions.\nEliminate any incoming light other than the emitted light from the brain tissue. Switch off the epi-illumination light source and close the enclosure of the 2pFLIM rig. Activate the 2pFLIM PMT by switching on the hardware command voltage control.\nAcquire a z-stack 2pFLIM image using the 2pFLIM acquisition software FLIMimage with the following recommended settings for imaging tAKARα-positive somata in awake mice. Set frame averaging to 3 frames, scanning speed to 2 ms/line, image size to 128 x 128 pixels, and field of view to 90−100 μm. Adjust imaging settings based on the preparation and hardware configuration.\nInspect the acquired image in FLIMview (in-house developed custom software; see section 6). Adjust imaging settings following step 5.9 to optimize photon count and minimize photobleaching.\nNOTE: A workable integrated photon count in an ROI for lifetime imaging of a tAKARα-positive soma in vivo is ~1,000−10,000 photons depending on the signal amplitude that results from a particular stimulus (see Discussion).\n\t\nWhere needed, use a decreased field of view, decreased scanning speed, increased laser power, and increased number of frames to be averaged to increase the integrated photon counts and reduce the lifetime estimation error. At the same time, be sure to use the minimal essential laser power, frame averaging, and scanning speed to minimize photobleaching.",
    "Image at a regular time interval (e.g., every 30−60 s) by repeating the z-stack acquisition using settings determined in step 5.10. Acquire baseline 2pFLIM images for at least 15 min at zero treadmill speed.\nSet the treadmill rotation speed to ~15 cm/s for 15 min while acquiring 2pFLIM images. Continue imaging for ≥20 min after switching off the treadmill rotation, to assess the duration of PKA activity after cessation of forced locomotion.\n6. Analysis of 2pFLIM Images\nOpen the acquired images in FLIMview and set the following parameters in the FLIMview.\n\tNOTE: Parameter details are described in DISCUSSION.\n\t\nClick on the single photon counting (SPC) minimum and maximum range fields in FLIMview. Enter the appropriate minimum and maximum SPC range value, typically ranging between 1.2−2 and 10−12 ns, respectively.\nClick on the t0 value field in FLIMview and enter the t0 value (typically ~2 ns). Click on the lifetime luminance minimum threshold value field in FLIMview and enter the desired threshold value to 5−30 photons.\nClick on the new group button (N) and assign an experiment group name. This will generate a group that combines data from each added FLIM image.\nClick on the ROI button in the Roi Controls module of FLIMview and draw an ROI around a tAKARα-positive soma. Reduce the z-stack range, by moving the lower and upper z-limit in the z-stack Control sliders in FLIMview, to minimize signal contamination originating from background photons in other z depths.\nClick on the + button to add the FLIM image to the group (step 6.2). Click on the Calc button to calculate the mean lifetime (LT, also called mean photon emission time [MPET]), for the ROI and the lifetime estimation error (δτ).",
    "Open the next file in the chronical 2pFLIM imaging series. Repeat step 6.4. Be sure to adjust the position of the ROI and z-stack range to measure the same tAKARα-positive soma over time, because there can be tissue drift over time.\nSelect the deltaMPET/MPET0 in the drop-down menu of the Group Controls module. Click on the baseline# field and enter the index(es) (e.g., 1 2 3 4 5 for the first five images in the group created in step 6.3). This will define the image(s) used to calculate baseline lifetime (LT0).\nClick on Plot to generate a graph containing the FLIM response (ΔLT/LT0) of tAKARα during the experiment in the defined ROIs. Normalized changes in lifetime (ΔLT) of individual ROIs by the corresponding baseline lifetime (LT0) allow for comparison of PKA activity during locomotion across different ROIs.\nSubscription Required.
