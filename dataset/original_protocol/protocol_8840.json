    "Sprague-Dawley rats or BAB/c inbred mice (Harlan, UK; the number of pregnant females used was 30) were housed and sacrificed according to UK Home Office [and European Communities Council directive of 24 November 1986 (86/609/EEC)] guidelines. The project was formally approved by the UCL School of Pharmacy Ethics Committee.\n1. Preparation of Instruments, Culture Medium, and Dishes\nTurn on and clean the laminar flow hood with 70% ethanol in order to work under sterile conditions at all times.\nPrepare HEK293 cell culture medium, containing Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium pH 7.4 (DMEM, 500 ml), L-glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (50 Units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and fetal bovine serum (10%).\n\tNOTE: penicillin and streptomycin are irritants.\nPrepare the serum-free neuronal culture medium, containing Neurobasal medium pH 7.4 (500 ml), B27 supplement (25 ml), L-glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (50 Units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and glucose (6 mM).\nPrepare 500 ml of HEPES-buffered saline solution (HBSS), containing HBSS 10x stock (50 ml), HEPES (1 M) (5 ml) and water (445 ml), pH 7.4.\nAutoclave phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS, pH 7.4; 1 L), water (1 L), glass coverslips (13 mm in diameter) and glass Pasteur pipettes to sterilize them.\n2. Preparation of HEK293 Stable Cell Line Expressing α1/β3/γ2-GABAARs\nPlate 2x106 HEK293 cells into a 10 cm sterile tissue culture plate and incubate at 37 °С in a humidified 5% carbon dioxide (CO2) atmosphere (CO2 incubator) in order to reach 70-90% confluency overnight.",
    "The following day, transfect HEK293 cells with GABAAR α1 subunit cDNA in the pcDN 3.1(+) expression vector incorporating the G418 disulfate (Table 1) resistance gene, and the GABAAR β3 subunit cDNA in the  expression vector incorporating the phleomycin D1 (Table 1) resistance gene (both under the regulation of a human cytomegalovirus immediate-early (CMV) promoter), using a cationic liposome formulation, which complexes with negatively charged nucleic acid molecules (Table 1) according to manufacturer’s protocol.\nBriefly, add 500 μl of reduced serum medium (pH 7.4; Table 1) and 7.5 μg of each cDNA construct to a sterile 15 ml centrifuge tube, followed by 15 μl of liposomal transfection buffering reagent, and gently mix before leaving at room temperature for 5 min.\nTo this mixture, add 8.75 μl of liposomal transfection reagent and gently mix before leaving at room temperature for 30 min. Following this, add 3 ml of HEK293 cell culture medium (without antibiotics), pipette the contents of the centrifuge tube up and down twice, transfer drop-wise onto the cells growing in a 10 cm tissue culture dish, and incubate for 48 hr at 37 °С in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere (CO2 incubator).\nWash the HEK293 cells gently with sterile PBS, pH 7.4, and dilute the transfected HEK293 cells into new 10 cm tissue culture dishes, in the following ratios: 1:3, 1:5, 1:7, 1:10, 1:15 and 1:20. This ensures that the cells will not become overly confluent.\nStart selection of the HEK293 cells expressing both GABAAR subunits by adding 800 µg/ml of each antibiotic selection marker, G418, and Phleomycin D1, to the culture medium. Incubate the cells at 37 °С in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere (CO2 incubator) and replace the antibiotic-containing medium (10 ml) every 2 days.",
    "When small white colonies start to form (usually after about 7 days), carefully select a single colony from each of the dishes and collect it using a sterile P1000 pipette tip. Transfer it to one well of a 24-well tissue culture plate containing 500 µl of medium and carefully resuspend by pipetting the medium up and down. Ensure that exactly one colony is transferred into each well (a total of 5-20 colonies is advised). Incubate the cells at 37 °С in a humidified 5 % CO2 atmosphere (CO2 incubator) and replace the antibiotic-containing medium every 2 days.\nOnce the colonies become 70-80% confluent, gently pipette the medium up and down to dislodge the cells from the bottom of the 24-well tissue culture plate. Transfer and divide the suspension of cells between 2 wells in a 6-well tissue culture plate. Incubate the cells at 37 °С in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere (CO2 incubator) and replace the antibiotic-containing medium every 2 days.\nOnce 70 - 80% confluent, collect the cells from 1 of the 2 wells containing the cells originating from the same single colony and prepare protein lysates. Briefly, wash the cells 2x with PBS, pH 7.4, and add 200 µl of 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in PBS, pH 7.4. Collect the lysate and transfer it to the microcentrifuge tube. Measure the protein concentration using BCA protein reagent (see Table 1) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Analyze the expression of α1 and β3 subunits of GABAA receptors by SDS/PAGE and immunoblotting using subunit-specific antibodies (rabbit anti-α1-specific and rabbit anti-β3-specific GABAAR antibodies, see Table 1 for the information on these antibodies).",
    "Dislodge and transfer only positive clones from the remaining wells to larger 6 cm tissue culture dishes. Incubate the cells at 37 °С in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere (CO2 incubator) and replace the antibiotic-containing medium every 2 days.\nGradually expand the colonies of cells under the antibiotic selection by transferring them to 10 cm tissue culture dishes and finally to tissue culture flasks (T-75 flasks). Incubate the cells at 37 °С in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere (CO2 incubator) and replace the antibiotic-containing medium every 2 days.\nPlate 70,000 cells from each colony on glass coverslips (13 mm in diameter) and fix the cells to analyze the cell surface expression and co-localization of GABAAR subunits by immunofluorescence.\nSelect the positive clone of HEK293 cells expressing high levels of both α1 and β3 subunits of GABAA receptors, plate 2 x 106 cells into a 10 cm sterile tissue culture dish and incubate at 37 °С in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere (CO2 incubator) overnight. Ensure that the cells are incubated in antibiotic-containing (G418 and Phleomycin D1) medium at all times.\nThe following day, transfect HEK293 cells with GABAAR γ2s subunit cDNA in the pcDNA™ 3.1(+) expression vector incorporating Hygromycin B resistance gene using a non- liposomal lipid transfection reagent (Table 1).\nNOTE: This transfection method allows better survival and higher expression efficiency of foreign proteins in slow growing stable cell lines which are under continuous selection with antibiotics.\nIn a sterile 15 ml centrifuge tube, add 250 μl of Enhancer and DNA condensation buffer (Table 1) and 1.4 μg of γ2s GABAA receptor subunit cDNA. Add 11.2 μl of Enhancer and vortex for 1 sec before leaving at room temperature for 5 min.",
    "Add 35 μl of non-liposomal lipid transfection reagent and vortex for 10 sec before leaving at room temperature for 10 min. Add 3 ml of G418/Phleomycin D1-containing medium and pipette the content of the centrifuge tube up and down twice before transferring it drop-wise onto the cells growing in a 10 cm tissue culture plate. Incubate the cells for 48 hr at 37 °С in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere (CO2 incubator).\nWash the cells gently with sterile PBS and dilute them into new 10 cm tissue culture dishes, in the following ratios: 1:3, 1:5, 1:7, 1:10, 1:15 and 1:20.\nStart selection of α1/β3-HEK293 cells expressing the γ2s subunit by adding 800 µg/ml of antibiotic selection marker Hygromycin B to the G418/Phleomycin D1-containing medium. Replace the old medium with the fresh G418/Phleomycin D1/Hygromycin B-containing medium (10 ml) every 2 days.\nRepeat steps 2.7-2.12, under continuous selection in G418/Phleomycin D1/Hygromycin B-containing cell culture medium.\nStore the positive clones at -140 °C in antibiotic-free cell culture medium and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for the future use.\nTest the level of expression of α1, β3 and γ2s GABAAR subunits by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence in each clone following defrosting, because the expression can change due to reduced survival of cells under antibiotic selection.\n3. Maintenance of HEK293 Cell Lines\nDefrost a vial of control HEK293 cells or those expressing either α1/β2/γ2-GABAARs (Table 1) or α1/β3/γ2-GABAARs (described above) into 10 ml of cell culture medium in a 15 ml sterile centrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 440 x g for 5 min to remove excess DMSO.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend cells in 1 ml of fresh cell culture medium.",
    "First add 9 ml of fresh cell culture medium to a 10 cm tissue culture dish coated with poly-D-lysine (0.1 mg/ml) and then 1 ml of resuspended cells. Agitate gently, side-to-side, to disperse the cells and incubate at 37 °С in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere (CO2 incubator).\nThe following day, aspirate the medium to remove any cell debris and replace with 10 ml of fresh HEK293 cell culture medium.\nSelect stable cell lines with antibiotics to remove any cells which do not express GABAAR subunits and therefore also lack the expression of antibiotic resistance markers. For the α1/β2/γ2 stable cell line, replace normal medium with fresh cell culture medium containing G418 (800 μg/ml). For the α1/β3/γ2 cell line, replace with fresh cell culture medium containing G418 (800 μg/ml), Phleomycin D1 (800 μg/ml) and Hygromycin B (800 μg/ml). CAUTION! G418 is an irritant and Hygromycin B is corrosive, toxic and an irritant.\nPassage the cells into a new tissue culture dish by seeding at a lower density once they achieve >70 % confluency. Aspirate 10 ml of cell culture medium and wash twice briefly with PBS, pH 7.4. Add 1 ml of trypsin-EDTA solution, a solution of the protease trypsin (0.05% trypsin) and a Ca2+ chelator EDTA (0.02%) in PBS, pH 7.4, to detach the cells from the dish. CAUTION! Trypsin-EDTA solution is an irritant.\nAdd 10 ml of cell culture medium containing the correct antibiotics, to the dish and aspirate the cells. Centrifuge the cells at 440 x g for 5 min and resuspend them in 5 ml of the cell culture medium.",
    "Passage the cells using a 1:10 dilution into a new tissue culture flask (T-75 flask) containing fresh cell culture medium and the correct antibiotics. Incubate the cells at 37 °С in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere (CO2 incubator) and replace the medium every two days. Passage the cells when >70 % confluent (see step 2.8).\n4. Preparation of GABAergic Medium Spiny Neuron Culture\nUnder sterile conditions prepare a 24-well plate with poly-L-lysine (0.1 mg/ml)-coated coverslips (13 mm in diameter) and incubate at 37 °С in a humidified 5 % CO2 atmosphere (CO2 incubator).\nThe following day, aspirate with a pipette the excess poly-L-lysine and wash coverslips with two brief 10 sec and two 5 min long washes with sterile water. Add laminin (0.01 mg/ml) overnight and incubate at 37 °С in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere (CO2 incubator).\nSanitize the dissection area with 70% ethanol and gather an array of dissecting tools such as curved and straight tissue forceps, scissors and tweezers, and place into 70% ethanol to fully sterilize the dissecting instruments.\nPlace the pregnant rat/mouse euthanized with CO2 on its back and clean the skin on its abdomen with 70% ethanol. Pinch the skin with tweezers and cut around the abdomen through the skin, muscle and peritoneum, to reveal the internal organs and uterus with embryos clearly. Extract the embryos (E16-17) from the uterus and place them in a Petri dish with chilled PBS.\nPlace the embryos in the laminar flow hood and decapitate them, collecting the heads in a new Petri dish with chilled HBSS.\nUnder a dissecting microscope, dissect out the brains using the curved and straight forceps. Place the brains into a new Petri dish containing chilled HBSS.",
    "Separate the two cerebral hemispheres and carefully remove the meninges. Cut along the line of the hippocampus and peel back the cortex to reveal the striatum. Observe the striatum as a striated white structure at the anterior of the hemisphere.\nDissect the striatum and cut it into very small pieces (1 - 2 mm in diameter) and use a fire-polished Pasteur pipette to collect the material into a sterile 15 ml centrifuge tube with a total volume of 1 ml. Fire-polishing ensures the material is collected without being damaged.\nUsing the fire-polished tip of the Pasteur pipette, aspirate the cells and release them 8 - 10 times. Taking a new pipette with a fire-polish tip of approximately 30% of its original diameter (1 mm), triturate the solution a further 4 - 6 times until it appears homogeneous.\nFilter the cells using a 100 μm nylon cell strainer into a fresh sterile centrifuge tube.\nCount the cells with a hemocytometer and plate 70,000 cells into 500 µl of neuronal culture medium per well in a 24-well tissue culture plate. Agitate the wells left to right and incubate at 37 °С in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere (CO2 incubator) for 14 days in vitro (DIV).\nAfter 7 days, check the purity of neuronal cultures and, if glia cells are present, add cytosine β-D-arabinoside (Ara-C; 5 μM) to the wells to stop their proliferation. To do this, remove 250 μl of neuronal culture medium (pH 7.4) from each well and add 250 μl of fresh medium containing Ara-C. CAUTION! Ara-C is an irritant.\n5. Co-culture Preparation\nOn day 11 of neuronal culture, coat a 6-well plate with poly-D-lysine (0.1 mg/ml) under sterile conditions and incubate overnight at 37 °С in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere (CO2 incubator).",
    "The following day (day 12 of neuronal culture), aspirate the excess poly-D-lysine and wash wells 2x briefly and 2x for 5 min with sterile water before adding fresh cell culture medium (without antibiotics) to coat the wells with a small amount of serum from the medium.\nAspirate the culture medium from the tissue culture flask (T-75). Rinse the cells twice with PBS before adding 1 ml of Ca2+/Mg2+-chelating agent EDTA (0.48 mM) which gently and non-enzymatically dissociates cells. Agitate the cells to detach them from the bottom of the tissue flask.\nAdd 10 ml of cell culture medium (without antibiotics as this may interfere with transfection), aspirate the cells and place in a sterile centrifuge tube. Pellet cells at 440 x g for 5 min using a low-speed bench-top centrifuge.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1 ml of fresh cell culture medium. Using a hemocytometer, count the cells and plate at a density of 3 x 105 cells per well in a 6-well plate. Agitate gently and incubate for 24 hr at 37 °С in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere (CO2 incubator).\nThe following day (day 13 of neuronal culture) transiently transfect the HEK293 cells with mCherry cDNA in pcDNA3 expression construct using liposomal transfection reagent. Briefly, in a sterile microcentrifuge tube, add 500 μl of reduced serum medium and 5 μg of mCherry cDNA. Add 5 μl of liposomal buffering reagent and gently mix before leaving at room temperature for 5 min.\nAdd 8.75 μl of liposomal transfection reagent and gently mix before leaving at room temperature for 30 min. Pipette the contents of microcentrifuge tube up and down twice, transfer drop-wise to each well on the 6-well tissue culture plate and incubate at 37 °С in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere (CO2 incubator).",
    "The following day (day 14 of neuronal culture), aspirate the HEK293 cell culture medium from each of the 6-wells and wash each well twice briefly with PBS (pH 7.4). Add 300 μl of Ca2+/Mg2+-chelating agent EDTA (0.48 mM) and 200 μl of trypsin-EDTA (0.02 - 0.48 mM) solution to each well and incubate at 37 °С for 5 min.\nAdd 1 ml of fresh HEK293 cell culture medium per well (this quenches the trypsin) and aspirate the detached cells into a sterile 15 ml centrifuge tube. Centrifuge the cells at 440 x g for 5 min at room temperature and remove the supernatant. Resuspend the pellet in 500 μl of neuronal culture medium (pH 7.4).\nUsing a hemocytometer, count the cells and seed at a density of 30,000 cells per well in a 24-well tissue culture plate containing neurons. Agitate the plate to disperse the cells and incubate co-cultures at 37 °С in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere (CO2 incubator) for 24 hr.\n6. Analysis of Synaptic Contacts and their Activity\nAfter 23 hr in co-culture, investigate the formation of ‘active’ contacts between GABAergic medium spiny neurons and HEK293 cells using activity-dependent uptake of anti-synaptotagmin luminal domain-specific antibody conjugated with a fluorescent dye (Cy5, see Table 1).\nNOTE: The antibody will only gain access to the luminal domain of synaptotagmin, to which it binds when there is continuity between the synaptic vesicle lumen and extracellular space. This specifically occurs during neurotransmitter release, making this antibody an excellent marker of the active presynaptic terminals.",
    "Firstly rinse the co-cultures with neuronal medium (Neurobasal A medium, pH 7.4; see Table 1) and add Cy5-labeled mouse anti-synaptotagmin antibody, diluted 1:50 in neuronal medium (Neurobasal A medium, pH 7.4), to the cultures, for 30 min. Incubate the cells during this time at 37 °С in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere (CO2 incubator).\nTo remove the access of the antibody, wash the co-cultures briefly three times: first with cold normal PBS (pH 7.4), second with cold PBS (pH 7.4) containing 200 mM NaCl, and third with cold normal PBS (pH 7.4)\nFix the cells with 300 μl of 4% paraformaldehyde/4% sucrose in PBS (PFA, pH 7.4) for 10 min with agitation. Wash the cells briefly twice with PBS (pH 7.4) then with two longer 10 min washes.\nAdd glycine (0.3 M) to each well for 10 min with agitation to quench PFA.\nWash the cells briefly twice with PBS (pH 7.4) then with two longer 10 min washes before adding 300 μl of blocking solution (1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, pH 7.4) to reduce the non-specific binding of antibodies.\nAspirate the blocking solution and add the guinea pig anti-GABAAR-γ2 antibody directed against the γ2 N-terminal domain33 (1:3,000 in PBS, pH 7.4) overnight at 4 °С.\nThe following day, aspirate the primary antibody from the wells and wash the cells briefly twice with PBS then with two longer 10 min washes.\nPermeabilize the cells using Triton X-100 (0.1 %) in blocking solution for 30 min at room temperature.\nWash the cells briefly twice with PBS (pH 7.4) then with two longer 10 min washes before adding either the mouse anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65 antibody (1:4,000, Table 1) or the mouse anti-synapsin I antibody (1:1,000, Table 1) for 120 min at room temperature.",
    "Wash the cells briefly twice with PBS (pH 7.4) then with two longer 10 min washes and then add blocking solution for 30 min at room temperature.\nCentrifuge the appropriate secondary antibodies (typically goat anti-guinea pig IgG conjugated to Cy5, goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 or goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 405, all at 2 μg/ml) to remove aggregates of antibodies at 21,910 x g for 10 min, and add antibodies (1:750) to blocking solution. Apply to appropriate wells for 1 hr and cover with aluminum foil to protect the fluorophores from light exposure and consequent photobleaching.\nFinally, wash the cells briefly twice with PBS (pH 7.4) then with two longer 10 min washes to remove any unbound secondary antibody and mount the coverslips using mounting reagent (Prolong Gold, Table 1) roughly 10 µl per coverslip. Allow 24 hr to set at room temperature while protected from light before transferring to 4 °С for long term storage.\nAnalyze samples using a laser scanning confocal microscope with a 63X oil-immersion objective. Ensure the light levels and detector gain is adjusted to avoid saturation.\nObserve potential synapse-like contacts as regions of co-localization between the presynaptic terminals positive for GAD65, synapsin I or Cy5-labelled anti-synaptotagmin and the postsynaptic HEK293 cells visualized by DIC or by the mCherry fluorescent indictor.\nCount potential synapse-like contacts using Z-stack series of optical sections (8 - 10) through a depth of 4 - 5 μm per cell using the imaging software."
