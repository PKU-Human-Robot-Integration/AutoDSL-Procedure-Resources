    "AHA pulse labelingSeed cells in a 6-well plate containing normal cell culture medium so that cells should be 50%-60% confluent next day. Mouse B cells (in suspension) were used in this study but any cell types can be used.Next day, starve cells in the methionine-free medium for 30 min. Note: This step may be omitted to avoid cellular stress. Start pulse labeling by adding 1 mM AHA or methionine (negative control) to the methionine-free medium and incubate cells for at least 10 min in a 37 °C CO2 Incubator. Cycloheximide treatment (100 μg/ml) can be used as a negative control as well.Wash cells with ice-cold PBS. Spin down cells at 500 x g, 4 °C for 3 min and remove the supernatant. Repeat this step once more. For adherent cells such as HEK293, 1 mM EDTA in PBS can be used to harvest cells.Note: From this step, we used 96-well U- or V-bottom cell culture plate for subsequent steps to increase the throughput. For subsequent steps, use 100-200 μl solution to suspend cells after spinning. Fix cells in fixing solution (4% PFA in PBS) for 15 min at RT. Spin down cells and remove the supernatant.Permeabilize cells with 1% BSA with 0.2% saponin (or 0.25% Triton X-100) in PBS for 15 min. Spin down cells at 500 x g, at RT for 3 min and remove the supernatant.Click reactionPrepare the click reaction solution (see Recipe 5).Incubate samples with 100 μl of the click solution for 30 min at RT. Protect from light.Wash cells once with 1% BSA with 0.2% saponin in PBS. Spin down cells and remove the supernatant. In case of Trition X-100 is used for permeabilization, wash cells with 1% BSA in PBS.",
    "Immunolabeling of a mitotic marker, histone H3 phospho Ser10Incubate samples with anti-phospho histone pH3 antibody (1:100, v/v) in 100 μl 1% BSA in PBS for 60 min. Protect from light. Wash cells twice with 1% BSA in PBS. Spin down cells and remove the supernatant.Resuspend in FACS buffer (1% FBS, 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% NaN3 in PBS) and transfer cells into a 5 ml round bottom polystyrene FACS tube.Flow cytometric analysisGate the main cell population by the forward (FSC-A) and side scatter profile (SSC-A) to exclude cellular debris and dead cells (Figure 2A). Gate further the singlet subset by SSC-H and SSC-W (Figure 2B).For the subset of cells gated in the Step D1, record AHA-incorporation (y-axis, alexa488) and the mitotic marker (x-axis, alexa647) for at least 10,000 events (Figure 2C). Quantify AHA intensities (y-axis) in interphase and mitotic cells (x-axis) that are separated based on fluorescence intensity of the mitotic marker (see Step D4). Note: Prepare single color (stained with the Alexa Fluor488-AHA or the Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated antibody) and no color controls for setting FACS parameters and compensation on the flow cytometer. Each compensation control is acquired on the flow cytometer to determine compensation values for each fluorochrome combination. This protocol does not cover detailed instructions for FACS parameter setup. For assistance, please contact your FACS core facility. Check if the negative control sample (methionine-labeled cells) shows the low level of AHA-incorporation (Figure 2D). Quantify the AHA intensities for individual cells (e.g., median intensity) in interphase and mitosis using FlowJo. To do this, open FlowJo and load the files (.fcs) into a workspace. Double-click on a file in the workspace and a plot like Figure 2A will appear. Select subsets for further analyses based on the forward (FSC-A) and side scatter profile (SSC-A) as described in Step D1.",
    "Select corresponding populations of interphase and mitosis (see Figure 2C) and click on “Workspace” → “Statistics” → “Median” → “AHA”, which calculates median intensities of AHA signal. Examples of data analysis are shown in Figure 2E.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190415/20190415005251_2587.jpgFigure 2. Monitoring global protein synthesis in interphase and mitosis. A and B. Gating strategy. C. The main cell population was further analyzed by dual staining for phospho-H3 S10 and AHA-labeled proteins. Global protein synthesis was monitored by AHA incorporation (y-axis) in interphase and mitosis (based on H3 pS10 staining, x-axis). D. As a negative control, methionine incorporation into proteins instead of AHA was also monitored. E. Examples of quantitative outputs: each dot represents the median AHA intensity calculated from the interphase or mitotic cell population in an independent experiment. The results from three independent experiments are shown."
