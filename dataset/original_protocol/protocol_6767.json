    "For this protocol, we used human P-gp FRET probes (Futamata et al., 2020). Schematic representations of the fluorescent protein-tagged P-gps are shown in Figure 1. Human P-gp FRET probes are available from the corresponding author, Kazumitsu Ueda (ueda.kazumitsu.7w@kyoto-u.ac.jp[href=https://bio-protocol.org/eda.kazumitsu.7w@kyoto-u.ac]).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3930/bioprotoc-11-04-3930-g001.jpgFigure 1. Schematic representations of fluorescent protein-tagged P-gps. We generated a FRET construct, human P-gp–FRET, in which mCerulean (donor) was inserted after NBD1 and mVenus (acceptor) was fused after NBD2. Another FRET construct, P-gp–VsCn, in which mVenus and mCerulean were fused tandemly after NBD2, was predicted to show a high level of FRET despite the conformation. P-gp–mCerulean, in which mCerulean was inserted after NBD1, and P-gp–mVenus, in which mVenus was fused after NBD2, were constructed as negative controls. TMD, trans-membrane domain. NBD, nucleotide-binding domain, a.a., amino acid. Note: HEK293 cells are maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (10%FBS-DMEM) in a 100 mm cell culture dish at 37 °C under 5% CO2. For incubation, a CO2 incubator was used. Intact cellsTransient expression of fluorescent protein-tagged P-gpsDay 1 Add 100 μl PLL solution to the 35 mm glass-based dish and incubate for 30 min at room temperature.Note: PLL solution was used to promote cell adhesion to the dish. Wash with 1.5 ml 1× PBS(-) twice.Prepare HEK293 cells cultured in the 100 mm cell culture dish and discard the culture medium.Wash with 1.5 ml 1× PBS(-) twiceAdd 1 ml 0.05% EDTA-Trypsin and incubate for 2 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2.Add 9 ml 10% FBS-DMEM and transfer to a 15 ml tube.Centrifuge at 1,100 × g for 2 min at room temperature.Discard the supernatant and add 10 ml 10% FBS-DMEM.Count the number of cells using CellDrop following the manufacturer’s protocol.Dilute the cells to 1.5 × 105 cells/ml.Seed HEK293 cells to the glass-based dish at 3.",
    "0 × 105 cells/well and incubate for 24 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2.Day 2 Prepare the DNA-lipid complex.Note: The minimum plasmid DNA set is P-gp–FRET, two negative controls (P-gp–mCerulean and P-gp–mVenus), and one positive control (P-gp–VsCn). Mix 2.5 μg plasmid DNA and 2.5 μl PLUS Reagent in 500 μl Opti-MEM and mix with the vortex mixer.Incubate for 5 min at room temperature.Add 6.25 μl Lipofectamine LTX and mix with the vortex mixer.Incubate for 30 min at room temperature.Replace the medium with 500 μl DNA-lipid complex and 1.5 ml 10% FBS-DMEM and incubate for 23 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2.Image acquisitionDay 3 Wash with 2 ml FluoroBrite DMEM twice.Replace the medium with 1 ml FluoroBrite DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 1× GlutaMAX and incubate for 1 h.Transfer the dish to the incubation chamber equipped to the microscope.Transfer 500 μl medium to a 1.5 ml tube and mix with 2 μl verapamil chloride stock solution (final 100 μM).Notes: Do not add verapamil chloride stock solution to the glass-based dish directly because HEK293 cells can be peeled off by pipetting. Verapamil is a P-gp substrate. Return the medium to the glass-based dish and further incubate for 5 min.Acquire images of the mVenus, mCerulean, and FRET signals according to the parameters below and save as .lsm or .czi format.mVenus is excited at 488 nm, and the fluorescence emission is collected using a band pass filter (521-600 nm) (Figure 2). mCerulean is excited at 445 nm, and the fluorescence emission is collected using a short-pass filter (490 nm). For the FRET signal image, the laser is set to 445 nm, and the sensitized emission is collected using a band pass filter (521-600 nm) (Figure 3).",

Scale bars = 10 μm.Semi-intact cellsNote: Membrane permeabilization is suitable for manipulating the concentration of small molecules such as nucleotides. Transient expression of the fluorescent protein tagged P-gp constructs.Day 1 Seed the HEK293 cells as described in Steps A1a-A1k.Day 2 Prepare the DNA-lipid complex as below.Note: Do not use Lipofectamine LTX when performing membrane permeabilization because it inhibits the pore formation by SLO. Mix 2 μg plasmid DNA and 98 μl Opti-MEM in a 1.5 ml tube and mix with the vortex mixer.Mix 10 μl 1 mg/ml PEI-MAX and 90 μl Opti-MEM in another 1.5 ml tube and mix with the vortex mixer.Mix the DNA and PEI-MAX and mix with the vortex mixer.Incubate at room temperature for 30 min.Replace the medium with 200 μl DNA-PEI complex and 1.8 ml 10% FBS-DMEM and incubate for 24 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2.Membrane permeabilization and image acquisitionNote: We recommend performing this step using one or two samples at a time in order to avoid the cells permeabilizing for a long time. Day 3 Wash with 2 ml ice-cold 1× PBS(-).Add 1 ml serum-free DMEM containing 50 ng/μl SLO and incubate for 5 min on ice.Notes: Dilute SLO just before use. SLO is a streptococcal toxin which forms 25-30 nm aqueous pores within the plasma membrane, which allows the free passage of ions and small molecules. Wash with 2 ml ice-cold 1× PBS(-) three times.",
