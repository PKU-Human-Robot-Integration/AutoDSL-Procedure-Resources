    "1. Fabrication of Porous Metal Scaffolds\nPrepare Ti-camphene slurries by mixing commercially available Ti powder, camphene, and KD-4 after weighing the appropriate amounts of materials as described in Table 1 for porous Ti scaffolds with four initial porosities (40, 50, 60, and 70). Pour the slurries into 500 ml polyethylene (PE) bottles and rotate the bottles at 55 °C for 30 min in a ball-mill oven at 30 rpm.\nPour the slurries from the PE bottles into cylindrical aluminum (Al) molds with a diameter of 60 mm and a height of 60 mm. Seal each Al mold with the corresponding Al cover slip and rotate the molds in a ball-mill oven at a speed of 30 rpm at 55 °C for 10 min.\n\t\nSubsequently, decrease the temperature of the ball-mill oven to 44 °C, and continuously rotate the molds at a speed of 30 rpm at the constant temperature of 44 °C for 12 hr.\nTake out the mold from the ball-mill oven after additionally rotating the molds at RT for 1 hr for the cooling process. Remove the solidified titanium/camphene green body from the Al mold using an Al plunger.\nPlace the solidified titanium/camphene green body in a rubber bag by hand and completely seal the rubber bag by tying the mouth of the bag with a string. Place the rubber bag in the water tank of a cold isostatic pressing (CIP) machine and apply an isostatic pressure of 200 MPa for 10 min. Remove the compressed green body from the rubber bag.\nTransfer the Ti-camphene green body on to an alumina crucible by hand and place the crucible in the freeze-dryer machine. Freeze-dry the green body to sublimate the camphene phase in the green body at - 40 °C for 24 hr.",
    "Subsequently, close the crucible with an alumina cover slip and place the closed crucible in a vacuum furnace (below 10-6 Torr) at RT. Then, increase the temperature of the furnace to 1,300 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C/min and hold the temperature at 1,300 °C for 2 hr.\nAfter the heat treatment, keep the sintered porous Ti in the furnace for 6-7 hr until the furnace is fully cooled to RT.\n\tNote: During 6 hr of the cooling process, the average cooling rate of the furnace above 400 °C is ~15 °C/min and the average cooling rate of the furnace below 400 °C is ~2 °C/min.\nIf necessary, cut the block of sintered porous Ti into disc-shaped samples with a diameter of 16 mm through electrical discharge machining (EDM).27\n\tNote: Depending on the size of the Al molds, the size of the sintered porous Ti needs to be modified through the machining process (Figure 2A).\nPlace a glass beaker with the porous Ti samples in an autoclave and sterilize the samples at 121 °C for 15 min. Remove the samples from the autoclave. Wash the porous Ti samples with distilled water twice and then with 70% ethanol twice. Finally, leave the porous Ti into a Petri dish and air-dry the samples at RT on a clean bench under UV light.\n2. Dip Coating of Scaffolds with Bioactive Agents\nDilute the commercial Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP) from 1 mg/ml to 100 μg/ml in a clean bench by mixing 1 ml of GFP with 9 ml of Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS, pH 7.4) solution in a 10 ml-sterilized polystyrene (PS) tube as indicated in Table 1.",
    "Immerse the sterilized dense or porous Ti in 10 ml of diluted GFP solution (100 µg/ml) by placing the Ti samples into the PS tube with the GFP solution at RT and placing on a clean bench.\nPlace the PS tube in a vacuum desiccator and evacuate the desiccator for 10 min to ensure the GFP solution penetrates the pores of the porous Ti more effectively.\nRemove the porous titanium from the PS tube using tweezers. Place the GFP-coated porous Ti into a 10 cm diameter Petri dish and air-dry O/N at RT on a clean bench.\nRinse the porous Ti twice with 10 ml of Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS) in a glass beaker, and move the porous Ti into a 10 cm diameter Petri dish using tweezers and air-dry at RT on a clean bench.\n3. Densification of Porous Scaffolds\nPlace the GFP-coated porous Ti samples with various heights in a cylindrical steel die, and insert a set of punches into the top and bottom holes of the steel die (Figure 3A).\nCompress the porous Ti within the steel die assembly at RT in the z direction of the sample (Figure 3A) using a press machine at intermediate strain rates of 0.05 ~ 0.1 sec-1 against the predetermined applied strains shown in Table 2. Hold the pressure for 1 min before unloading.\nRemove the densified Ti samples from the steel die. Wash the densified samples twice with 10 ml of DPBS in a beaker and air-dry O/N at RT on a clean bench.\n4. Release Test of GFP-coated Scaffolds",
    "Immerse three types of specimens (GFP-coated dense Ti (after steps 2), GFP-coated porous Ti (after steps 1 and 2) and GFP-coated densified porous Ti (after steps 1-3)) in 5 ml DPBS (pH 7.4) solution contained in a 10 ml sterilized PS tube at 37 °C on a clean bench.\nSuction out all the DPBS solution from each PS tube with the GFP-coated sample and replenish with a new 5 ml DPBS solution (pH 7.4) using a pipette according to the predetermined times of 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 15, 22 and 29 days after immersion.\nTake the fluorescence images of the GFP-coated samples before immersion (day 0) and after 22 day-immersion using confocal laser scanning spectroscopy (CLSM).\nMeasure the fluorescence signal intensity of the released GFP in 1 ml solution from a total of 5 ml DPBS solution drawn from each PS tube in section 4.2 using UV spectroscopy at a wavelength of 215 nm. Convert the intensity value into the concentration of the GFP solution using the standard curve.\n\tNote: Before the measurement, draw the standard curve of GFP solution by measuring the fluorescence signal intensity of the GFP solution in the concentration range of 0 ng/ml - 10 µg/ml.\n5. Fabrication of Graded Porous Ti Scaffolds\nProduce a block of the sintered porous Ti by repeating step 1.1 to step 1.7.\nMachine the sintered porous Ti block according to the predetermined structure designs (e.g., Figure 5a and 5d) by EDM.\nPlace the machined Ti samples with height distribution in a steel die where the diameter of porous Ti is ~0.1 mm smaller than the diameter of the die and insert a set of punches into the top and bottom holes of the steel die.\nPerform steps 3.2 and 3.3.\n6. Porosity Measurement of Ti Scaffolds",
    "Measure the mass (ms) of Ti scaffolds.\nCalculate the apparent volume (Vs) by measuring length, width and height of Ti scaffolds.\nCompute the porosity using the following equation:\n\t  imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53279/53279eq1.jpg\n\twhere P is the total porosity percentage, ρTi is the theoretical density of the titanium and mS/VS is the measured density of the sample.\n\tNote: The porosity of Ti samples can be directly retrieved from microCT images after microCT imaging is carried out using a micro-computed tomography scanner.\nSubscription Required.
