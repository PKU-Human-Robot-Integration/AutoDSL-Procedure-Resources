    "1. Preparation of Various Solutions and Protein Samples\nPrepare 100 ml of phosphate buffer solution (PBS-G) containing 50 mM NaH2PO4, 50 mM NaCl, and 10% glycerol at pH 6.8.\nPrepare 250 ml of HEPES buffer solution containing 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20 at pH 7.4.\nPrepare stock solution of building block 1 (BB1) lactose and building block 2 (BB2) sulfated lactose (Figure 1) at 0.2 mM in PBS-G.\nPrepare 1 ml of protein solutions in HEPES: Arachis hypogaea lectin (AHL) at 500 nM, myoglobin at 1 µM, and lysozyme at 500 nM.\nPrepare 20 ml of 1% SDS in ultrapure water.\n2. Preparation of the CoCRR Array\nClean the gold surface of the prism 48 hr prior to use with a plasma cleaner for 3 min under these conditions: 75% Oxygen, 25% Argon, 0.6 mbar, power 40 W.\nPrepare eleven pure and mixed solutions of BB1 and BB2 with [BB1]/([BB1]+[BB2]) ratios between 0 and 100% by increments of 10% at a total BB concentration of 0.1 mM in PBS-G.\nDeposit 8 nl droplets of these pure and mixed solutions on the prism surface using a non-contact spotter in quadruplicate for each ratio with 44 spots in total (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: 10% glycerol added in PBS-G is very important to reduce solvent evaporation and the change of BB concentration after deposition.\nPlace the prism inside a Petri dish containing 1 ml of ultrapure water and leave it O/N at RT for self-assembly of BB1 and BB2 on the gold surface. Herein, it is assumed that the average surface composition in the mixed SAMs reflects the composition of the deposition mixed solution (Figure 3)11.\nWash thoroughly the prism with ultrapure water and then dry it under a flow of argon.\n3. Protein Sensing by SPRi",
    "Set the incubator in which the SPRi apparatus is placed at 25 °C to avoid refractive index changes induced by temperature variation during protein sensing.\nInsert a non-functionalized rinsing prism in the 10 µl Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) flow cell connected to a computer controlled syringe pump, a degasser and a 6-port medium pressure injection valve (Figure 4). Fill in the flow system with freshly filtered and degassed running buffer HEPES.\nRemove the rinsing prism and insert the prism containing the CoCRR array in the flow cell. Run HEPES at a 100 µl/min flow rate. With the help of the CCD camera remove any air bubbles present on the prism surface by passing running buffer quickly.\nDefine study area for each spot by drawing a circle with the same diameter for the area of interest based on a well-contrasted image of the array and with the help of integrated software in SPRi system.\nTrace plasmon curves, which represent reflectivity curves in function of the incident angle, for all the spots.\nChoose the working angle (position at which kinetic curves will be recorded) at the highest slope of the reflectivity curves. Rotate the scanning mirror to fix the selected working angle for kinetic measurements.\nContinue to run HEPES through the flow system until reflectivity signal for all the spots is stable and constant.\nInject 1 ml AHL solution with a syringe into the sample loop (500 µl) with the injection valve on position “load”. Then put the injection valve to position “injection”. The flow rate used for all the protein injection was 100 µl/min.\nStart kinetic measurements by monitoring reflectivity variations against time simultaneously on all the spots.",
    "At the end of protein injection, rinse the array with running buffer for 8 min. Finally, inject 1 ml 1% SDS to regenerate it.\nRepeat the same procedure for the other proteins.\n4. Data Processing and Analysis\nFollowing entry of protein solution into the flow cell, molecular binding occurs and induces a shift of the plasmon curves and a variation of reflectivity. The image acquisition software converts the measured light intensity values to gray scale levels, giving SPR images Figure 5A, and generates the variation of reflectivity versus time, giving sensorgrams (Figure 5B).\nUse a math computing software to plot the reflectivity (R%) at the end of each protein injection versus the [BB1]/([BB1]+[BB2]) ratio to generate 2D continuous evolution profile (CEP) for each sample (Figure 5C).\nAdd the [BB1]/([BB1]+[BB2]) ratio in sensorgrams (Figure 5B) to generate 3D continuous evolution landscape (CEL) for each protein (Figure 5D).\nSubscription Required.
