    "1. Plant material preparation\nSample at least two leaves per plant in 50 mL polypropylene tubes, an outer (older) and an inner (younger) one in order to represent more accurately the whole plant. Collect at least three biological replicates for each sample.\nFreeze them immediately using liquid nitrogen and store them at -80 °C until use. Make sure the liquid nitrogen does not get into the tubes; otherwise they could explode when removed due to the gas expansion during vaporization.\n\tCAUTION: Gloves and a face shield are required due to the potential hazards associated with using liquid nitrogen.\nRemove the caps from the tubes and place them on the trays within the freeze dryer chamber of the lyophilizer (Table of Materials) programmed as follows: -25 °C for 72 h, -10 °C for 10 h, 0 °C for 10 h, and 20 °C for at least 4 h. Maintain the condenser temperature and the vacuum constant during the freeze-drying process at -80.2 °C and 112 mTorr, respectively.\nWhen the material is completely dry (between 4 and 7 days depending on the plant and the degree of compaction into the tube), preserve at 4 °C, -20 °C or -80 °C for short (days to weeks), medium (months) or long (years) storage, respectively. The inclusion of bags containing silica gel beads in the sample-containing tubes is recommended.\nPlace the lyophilized samples into 20 mL polypropylene tubes together with 10 mm diameter stainless steel balls and grind them with a multitube vortexer using the intensity and time needed to obtain a fine dust.\n\tNOTE: During the entire process, protect the samples from exposure to direct light.\n2. Reagent and solution preparation\nPrepare the solvent extraction solution: 8% acetic acid (v/v), 1% MPA (meta-phosphoric acid) (w/v), 1 mM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid).",
    "Calculate the total volume of solvent needed to process the whole set of samples taking into account that 5 mL will be added to each. To prepare 1 L of the solution, add to a flask: 30 g of MPA, 0.372 g of EDTA dehydrate, 80 mL of acetic acid and 500 mL of ultrapure water (scale volumes and quantities accordingly). Seal the flask mouth with plastic film.\nOnce dissolved with the help of a magnetic stirrer, use a volumetric flask to accurately measure 1 L, adding the necessary ultrapure water.\nPrepare the reduction reaction buffer (0.5 M Tris (2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol) pH 9.0) and reducing solution (40 mM DTT (1,4-Dithiothreitol) with 0.5 M Tris pH 9.0).\n\t\nCalculate the total volume of reducing solution needed to process the whole set of samples taking into account that 200 µL will be added to each of them. To prepare 100 mL of the buffer, add to a beaker: 6.055 g of Tris and 90 mL of ultrapure water (scale volumes and quantities accordingly). Seal the beaker mouth with plastic film.\nOnce dissolved with the help of a magnetic stirrer, adjust the solution to pH 9.0 by adding 2 M HCl and use a volumetric flask to accurately measure 100 mL, adding the necessary ultrapure water.\nTo prepare 100 mL of the reducing solution, add to a beaker: 0.629 g of DTT (purity: 98%) and 90 mL of the buffer (0.5 M Tris pH 9.0) previously prepared (2.2.1 to 2.2.2). Scale volumes and quantities accordingly. Seal the beaker mouth with plastic film.\nOnce dissolved with the help of a magnetic stirrer, use a volumetric flask to accurately measure 100 mL, adding the necessary volume of buffer 0.5 M Tris pH 9.0.",
    "NOTE: The reducing solution is very unstable. That is why a freshly made solution is strongly recommended.\nSulphuric acid (0.4 M H2SO4)\n\t\nCalculate the total volume of 0.4 M sulphuric acid needed to process the whole set of samples taking into account that 200 µL will be added to each. To prepare 100 mL of the solution, add to a beaker: 80 mL of ultrapure water and then 2.22 mL of H2SO4 (purity: 96%, density: 1.84 g mL-1). Use a volumetric flask to accurately measure 100 mL, adding the necessary ultrapure water.\n\t\tCAUTION: Sulphuric acid is very corrosive, so it must be handled using protective equipment and under hood. In addition, the acid should be added to ultrapure water, and not water to acid, to reduce fumes and avoid accidents.\nHydrochloric acid (2 M HCl).\n\t\nTo prepare 100 mL of 2 M hydrochloric acid, add to a beaker: 80 mL of ultrapure water and then 6.13 mL of HCl (purity: 37%, density: 1.19 g mL-1). Seal the beaker mouth with plastic film. Use a volumetric flask to accurately measure 100 mL, adding the necessary ultrapure water. Scale volumes accordingly.\n\t\tCAUTION: Hydrochloric acid is very corrosive, so it has to be handled using protective equipment and under hood. In addition, the acid should be added to ultrapure water, and not water to acid, to reduce fumes and avoid accidents.\nAA standard (stock and dilutions)\n\t\nWeigh exactly 10 mg of AA standard (purity: 99%) using a precision balance and add 90 mL of mobile phase (ultrapure water pH 2.0 with formic acid).\nOnce dissolved with the help of a magnetic stirrer, use a volumetric flask to accurately measure 100 mL, adding the necessary volume of ultrapure water pH 2.0 with formic acid.\n\t\tNOTE: Protect this stock solution from the exposure to light.",
    "Prepare five dilutions from the stock of the AA standard to obtain a calibration curve following the instructions in Table 1 and proceed with step 5.2.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nStandard,[AA] (µg mL-1),AA (100 µg mL-1) solution (µL),Mobile phase (µL)a\n1,0.5,5,995\n2,2.5,25,975\n3,5,50,950\n4,10,100,900\n5,25,250,750\naUltrapure water pH 2.0 acidified by formic acid.,aUltrapure water pH 2.0 acidified by formic acid.,aUltrapure water pH 2.0 acidified by formic acid.,aUltrapure water pH 2.0 acidified by formic acid.\nTable 1: Protocol to prepare five standards of AA (ascorbic acid). Volumes of solute and solvent to prepare each of the different concentrations of the standards are indicated.\n3. Extraction of AA and DHAA\nNOTE: It is recommended to work under conditions of low light intensity during the extraction steps.\nTo a 15 mL polypropylene centrifuge tube, add 50 mg of lyophilized ground sample and 5 mL of the extraction solvent (step 2.1).\nShake the mixture using a vortex for 5 s and then an orbital shaker for 10 min at 2000 rpm.\nIntroduce the tube in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min at room temperature with ultrasound activated.\nCentrifuge at 4,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\nTake the supernatant, pass it through a 0.22 µm regenerated cellulose filter and store it in a 5 mL amber vial. This is Extract 1, which contains AA and DHAA.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here by freezing the extracts at -80 °C and protecting them from exposure to light as AA and DHAA are very unstable and degrade easily in the presence of light, at high temperatures or under oxidizing atmospheres (Supplemental File 1).\n4. DHAA reduction to AA to extract TAA",
    "Transfer 200 µL of Extract 1 to a 2 mL amber vial for liquid chromatography and add 200 µL of the reducing solution (step 2.2). Close the vial with a PTFE-silicone plug with pre-opening and shake it with a vortex for 5 s.\nAllow the solution to stand for 30 min at room temperature and protect from light.\nAdd 200 µL of 0.4 M H2SO4 to stop the reaction and stabilize AA in acidic pH. The resulting solution is Extract 2, which contains only AA and is actually TAA.\n5. Determination\nUPLC-UV preparation\n\t\nPrepare the working solutions described in Table 2, suitably filtered through 0.22 µm filters, sonicated for at least 10 min and place them in the UPLC system.\nSwitch on the three UPLC modules and wait for the internal calibration process to finish.\nOpen the software (e.g., Empower 3) and load the instrumental program described in Table 2: Empower 3 | Run Samples | Vitamin C method | UPLC_PDA | Use QuickStart.\nOnce the software is loaded with the correct program, access the UPLC management console: Quaternary Solvent Manager | Click right mouse button | Launch Console.\nProceed to the preparation and stabilization of the UPLC instrument: System | Control | Startup.\n\t\t\nPurge all UPLC lines for at least 5 min: Prime Solvents | QSM | Check A, B, C, D and Seal Wash | Duration of prime > 5 min.\nPurge and clean the injector: Prime Solvents | SM | Check Wash solvent (> 45 s) and Check Purge solvent (> 35 cycles).",
