Add ampicillin to the secondary culture at a concentration of 100 μg/mL and keep it on a shaker incubator at 37°C with 250 rpm shaking.\nWhen the secondary culture reaches absorbance between 0.4-0.6 (late log phase) at 600 nm, induce protein expression with 0.75 mM IPTG (Isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside).\nNote: To check the optical density, 1 mL of culture is taken in a cuvette and absorbance is measured at 600 nm using a spectrophotometer.\nAfter 4 h of protein expression at 37°C, harvest cells by centrifugation at 3000 g for 15 min at 4°C.\nProtein Purification Day 1.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 20 mL of TDP1 breaking buffer (100 mM KCl, 30 mM K3PO4 pH 7.0, 1× Protease Inhibitor cocktail) with 20 s vortexing after every 30 min for 4 h on ice.",
    "Sonicate the cells at 30% amplitude for 30 s followed by 2 min pause on ice for a total pulse time of 30 min using a probe sonicator.\nClear the sonicated sample by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C.\nCollect the supernatant and then filter it through a 0.22 μm syringe filter.\nLoad the filtered supernatant onto 5 mL packed Whatman Cellulose Phosphate P11 column.\nWash the P11 column with 10 mL phosphocellulose wash buffer (400 mM KCl, 30 mM K3PO4 pH 7.0, 1× Protease Inhibitor cocktail).\nElute with 10 mL phosphocellulose elution buffer (800 mM KCl, 30 mM K3PO4 pH 7.0, 1× Protease Inhibitor cocktail).\nDesalt the eluate using PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with dialysis buffer/ Ni2+-NTA equilibration buffer without KCl (50 mM KH2PO4, 50 mM K2HPO4, 400 mM NaCl, 10 mM Imidazole, 1 mM DTT, 1× Protease Inhibitor cocktail).\nEquilibrate the Ni2+-NTA agarose bead (500 μL) silica column with equilibration/binding buffer (50 mM KH2PO4, 50 mM K2HPO4, 400 mM NaCl, 100 mM KCl, 10% Glycerol, 10 mM Imidazole, 1 mM DTT, 1× Protease Inhibitor cocktail) twice.\nLoad the desalted eluate onto the column and collect the flow through on a coaster.\nWash the column with 8 column volumes (CV). TDP1 Ni2+-NTA wash buffer containing 50 mM KH2PO4, 50 mM K2HPO4, 400 mM NaCl, 100 mM KCl, 10% Glycerol, 30 mM Imidazole and 1 mM DTT.\nPass 6 CV of Ni2+-NTA elution buffer containing 50 mM KH2PO4, 50 mM K2HPO4, 400 mM NaCl, 100 mM KCl, 10% Glycerol, 300 mM Imidazole and 1 mM DTT.\nCollect the elute as 1 mL fractions and store at −80°C.",
    "Pool elution fraction and dialyze using a dialysis membrane overnight for 12–18 h at 4°C in 1 L of storage/elution buffer without imidazole containing 50 mM KH2PO4, 50 mM K2HPO4, 400 mM NaCl, 100 mM KCl, 10% Glycerol, and 1 mM DTT.\nNote: Prepare this reagent fresh every time and do not store for longer than a day.\nNote: TDP1 purity was determined as a single band ∼70 kDa band representing over 95% of the detectable proteins stained by Coomassie after SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) as described27[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27] (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nProtein Purification Day 2.\nConcentrate the TDP1 protein by loading the dialyzed eluate in a 50 kDa cut concentrator and centrifuge for 20 min at 800 × g.\nPool fractions containing protein of interest, concentrate, and freeze aliquots in liquid nitrogen for storage at −80°C. Measure protein concentration using Bradford assay with BSA standard and run on an SDS-PAGE to check purity.\nIn vitro methylation of recombinant TDP1 protein\nTiming: 1 day\nThe proposed protocol uses the human PRMT5 fused to a FLAG tag protein (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Here, PRMT5 is present in its native form along with its co factors and post translational modifications (PTM). The pCMV-Tag2B-FLAG-PRMT5 is transfected in HEK293 cells and immunoprecipitated (IP) using anti-FLAG antibody (anti-mouse antibody M2 F3165) as described for FLAG-TDP1 (next section).1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],28[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28]\nAdd 8 μL of FLAG-PRMT5 IP beads with 2 μg of recombinant TDP1 protein in methylation buffer containing 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.5), 5 mM MgCl2, 4 mM DTT and 100 μM SAM (S-(5_-adenosyl)-L-methionine chloride dihydrochloride) in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nIncubate the microcentrifuge tube at 30°C for 2 h.\nStop the reaction by adding 2×SDS loading buffer (Invitrogen) and boiling the samples for 5 min.",
    "Note: Check the methylation signal on TDP1 by running the reaction mixture on a SDS PAGE and probing with SDMA antibody (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 5B) before proceeding to fluorescence cleavage assay using in vitro methylated TDP1.\nNote: Different types of in vitro modifications assay such as phosphorylation or ubiquitination can also be performed on recombinant TDP1 before proceeding to FRET-based TDP1 cleavage assay to check the effect of different PTM on TDP1 activity in real time.\nPurification of immune complexes of TDP1 protein (ex-vivo)\nTiming: 3–5 days\nThe proposed protocol uses the human TDP1 fused to a FLAG-tagged protein (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). The FLAG fusion facilitates precipitation of ectopically expressed TDP1 with anti-FLAG antibodies (anti-mouse antibody M2 F3165).1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11],28[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28] Here, TDP1 is present in its native form along with its co factors and post-translational modifications.\nTransfection of mammalian TDP1 construct.\nSeed HEK293 cells in two T-25 in order to achieve 70% confluency next day (2∗106 cells).\nNext day, transfect HEK293 cells with pCMV-Tag2B-FLAG-TDP1 (FLAG-TDP1) using Lipofectamine 2000 following the manufacturer’s protocol.\nNote: We established this protocol with HEK293 cell lines. HEK293 are cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. However, other cell lines may also be used.\nNote: We have found that TDP1 expression is optimal at 48 h following transfection in HEK293 cell line as analyzed by Western blotting against anti-FLAG antibodies (anti-rabbit F7425).\nCritical: Avoid the use of antibiotics during transfection. Antibiotics can reduce transfection efficiency or cause cell death.\nCo-immunoprecipitation using FLAG antibody.\n48 h post transfection, centrifuge cells at 1,500 × g for 6 min at 4°C.\nResuspend and wash the total pellet with ice-cold PBS followed by centrifugation, repeat PBS wash.",
    "Resuspend the pellet in 200 μL of ice-cold 1× IP lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.), 300 mM NaCl, 0.4% NP-40, 5 mM DTT and 1×protease inhibitor cocktail) for 1 h and vortex every 15 min for proper cell lysis. After incubation, centrifuge the cells at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nCollect 10% supernatant (lysate) in a separate microcentrifuge tube for input sample.\nCollect the remaining supernatant (lysate) in an IP vial and add 100 μL IP dilution buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.), 0.4% NP-40, 5 mM DTT and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail).\nIncubate the diluted lysate with 100 μL Protein A/G beads (50% slurry) at 4°C for 30–60 min for preclearing the cell lysate.\nCentrifuge the mixture at 15,000 × g for 1 min at 4°C, collect the supernatant in a new IP vial.\nIncubate the diluted lysate with 10 μL (10 μg/mL) anti-FLAG antibody (anti-mouse antibody M2 F3165) in an end-over-end rotator at 4°C for 1 h.\nAdd 100 μL Protein A/G beads to the FLAG antibody mixed lysate and incubate it in a rotator at 4°C overnight (12–18 h).\nNext day, centrifuge the mixture at 15,000 × g for 1 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the beads in 1 mL IP wash buffer followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 1 min at 4°C. Repeat the IP wash twice.\nDiscard the supernatant keeping the beads. Store the beads in −80°C degree.\nNote: The amount of antibody and Protein A/G agarose beads can vary depending on transfection efficiency and variability of cell lines.\nNote: Check the methylation signal on TDP1 by running the IP reaction mixture on a SDS PAGE and probing with SDMA antibody (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B) before proceeding to fluorescence cleavage assay.",
    "Critical: The timing for cell lysis will vary depending on the number of cells and cell line. It may be necessary to incubate longer to ensure complete cell lysis.\nPreparation of Top1cc/3′DNA lesions mimetic substrate\nTiming: 1 day\nThis protocol utilizes a double stranded and single stranded fluorescence-quencher DNA probe which mimics Top1cc/3′DNA lesion substrate.13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13] Both DNA substrates contains 5′ 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (56-FAM) and 3′ Black Hole Quencher (3BHQ) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nPreparation of 18 nucleotide ssDNA substrate (HEI-40) (5′-FAM/AGA GGA TCT AAA AGA CTT/3′-BHQ).\nDissolve the synthesized oligo HEI-40 obtained from IDT (HPLC purified) in an oligo dissolving buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 50 mM NaCl) to a final concentration of 50 μM.\nPreparation of dsDNA substrate (HEI-50) (56-FAM/AAG TCT TTT AGA TCC CTC CGG ATC TAA AAG ACT T/3BHQ).\nDissolve the synthesized oligo HEI-50 obtained from IDT in an oligo dissolving buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 50 mM NaCl) to a final concentration of 50 μM.\nHeat HEI-50 at 80°C for 10 mins and snap-cool rapidly on ice to promote hairpin formation.\nNote: The sequence of the 34 nt HEI-50 is self-complementary, apart from the central 4 nt, and can form a 15 bp double-stranded hairpin structure.\nCritical: The hairpin formation of dsDNA (HEI-50) needs to be made just before starting the assay reaction and maintained at 4°C before use.\nCritical: The substrates are light-sensitive. It is important to minimize exposure to light.\nExecution of fluorescence cleavage assay of TDP1\nTiming: 60–90 min",
    "In this step, we mix varying concentrations of TDP1 recombinant protein (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]) or TDP1 immune complex (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]) with a fixed concentration of fluorescently-quenched labeled oligos (HEI-40 and HEI-50) in the presence of a cleavage assay buffer to start the TDP1 cleavage reaction. The catalytic activity of TDP1 is monitored by increase in BHQ cleavage which is reflected by enhanced fluorescence intensity of the FAM fluorophore with time.\nSet up the cleavage assay reaction as shown in the table below.\nThe working stocks of TDP1 recombinant protein or TDP1 immune complexes and TDP1 substrates (HEI-40/HEI-50) were kept on ice. The cleavage assay buffer was kept on ice.\nMake a master mix to minimize error.\nSamples can be mixed in a microcentrifuge tube and transferred to a well in 96-well plate or mixed directly in the well.\nNote: Add the enzyme (TDP1) at the end just before putting the plate inside the reader. This step must be completed as quickly as possible to capture rapid kinetics of TDP1 activity.\nCritical: Use a new tip to load the TDP1 enzyme for each well to avoid cross contamination between wells and load the samples in the wells using a 45oangle to avoid the formation of bubbles.\nAdd 100 μL of cleavage assay buffer to a well as a blank buffer control.\nAdd reaction mixture to a well as a negative control.\nMeasure fluorescence intensity of all samples using the setting described in materials and equipment.\nWhen the measurement is done, save the data and take the plate out of the plate reader.\nCritical: In the SpectraMax M5 multimode microplate reader acquisition setting, ensure the Shake and Read steps are indented during the Kinetic steps.",
    "Note: Other Fluorescence microplate reader such as ThermoFisher Scientific Varioskan LUX may also be used to measure the fluorescence signal.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2577_14.csv\nNote: Variation of substrate-enzyme ratio depends on the sensitivity of the instrument.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2577_15.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2577_16.csv"
