    "1. In vitro kinetics experiment\nPreparation of DNA templates by PCR\n\t\nSet up PCR reaction(s): To prepare PCR reactions, combine the following reagents in a thin-walled PCR tube:\n\t\t33 µL of double-distilled water (ddH2O)\n\t\t10 µL of 5x buffer for high-fidelity DNA polymerase\n\t\t5 µL of 2 mM each deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP)\n\t\t0.5 µL of 40 µM forward primer\n\t\t0.5 µL of 40 µM reverse primer\n\t\t0.5 µL (10-100 ng) of DNA template (for Spinach2 PCR only; Broccoli primers overlap)\n\t\t0.5 µL of high-fidelity DNA polymerase (add last)\n\t\tNOTE: Synthetic oligonucleotides are often shipped dry. To prepare stock solutions, add a known volume (100 µL recommended) of ddH2O, and measure the A260 of that solution to determine the concentration by Beer's law, where the extinction coefficient can be calculated by nearest-neighbor rules online. This stock solution can then be used to make dilutions appropriate for use in PCR.\nRun the thermocycler protocol.\n\t\t\nUse the following thermocycler protocol to amplify full-length Spinach2 and Broccoli DNA templates:\n\t\t\tInitial denaturation:98 °C for 2 min\n\t\t\t35 cycles:\n\t\t\tDenaturation:98 °C denaturation for 15 s\n\t\t\tAnnealing:72 °C for 30 s\n\t\t\tExtension:72 °C for 30 s\n\t\t\tFinal extension: 72 °C for 5 min.\nAfter the reaction, analyze a small aliquot of the product by 2% agarose gel along with a low molecular weight ladder (size range: 25-766 nucleotides) to confirm the presence of the desired DNA product.\nPurify the product by commercially available gel extraction or PCR clean-up kits and elute with ddH2O or the buffer provided by the manufacturer.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Be sure when choosing a PCR clean-up kit that the column molecular weight cutoff is low enough to retain T7-Broccoli (81 nucleotides), or else the PCR product will be lost.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Optional pause point: store the DNA at −20 °C.",
    "Preparation of Spinach2 and Broccoli RNA by in vitro transcription (IVT)\n\t\nSet up the transcription reaction(s).\n\t\t\nTo prepare a 100 µL transcription reaction, combine the following reagents in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube: 10 µL of 10x transcription buffer + 20 µL of 10 mM ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTPs) + 1-64 µL of DNA template (total of 1 µg) + 2 µL of inorganic pyrophosphatase + ddH2O to 98 µL + 2 µL of T7 RNA polymerase (add last).\nIncubate this reaction for 4 h at 37 °C. Quench the reaction by adding 100 µL of 2x urea gel loading buffer (2x ULB), composed of 20% sucrose, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1x Tris-Borate-EDTA (1x TBE) buffer, and ~18 M urea.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Optional pause point: store the quenched reaction at −20 °C.\nPolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) purification of RNA\n\t\nPAGE purification of Spinach2 and Broccoli RNA\n\t\tCAUTION: Non-polymerized (liquid or powdered) acrylamide is extremely toxic. If weighing out powdered acrylamide, do so in a fume hood. Always wear proper protective equipment and immediately remove gloves contaminated with acrylamide powder or solution, washing hands thoroughly. If acrylamide comes in direct contact with the skin, wash the exposed area for at least 15 min with soap and water. If acrylamide comes in direct contact with the eyes, flush them with water for 15 min.\n\t\t\nPrepare the PAGE gel: To remove unwanted abortive transcripts and unreacted rNTPs from the full-length product, prepare a 6% urea-polyacrylamide gel. In general, 28 cm x 16.5 cm x 1.5 mm gels can be used with an 8-well comb. Set up the gel and electrophoresis equipment, using 1x TBE buffer to fill the reservoirs.",
    "Load RNA sample(s) in the PAGE gel: Load the gel with one quenched 200 µL reaction per lane. In a separate lane, load 2x ULB with tracker dyes xylene cyanol and bromophenol blue, which migrate in the gel at 106 nucleotides and 26 nucleotides, respectively15. Leave an empty lane between each sample to avoid potential contamination in the next steps.\nRun the PAGE gel: To separate 95-nt Spinach2 and 49-nt Broccoli from their respective truncated products, run the gel for 1.5-2 h at 25 W, at which point the bromophenol blue dye will have migrated ~5/6 of the gel length.\nVisualize the RNA sample(s) in the PAGE gel: Disassemble the glass plates around the gel and cover the gel in plastic wrap on both sides, labeling the lanes on the wrap. Visualize RNA bands in a dark room by UV shadowing by placing the wrapped gel on a fluorescent TLC plate under UV light. Quickly outline the edge of the RNA bands corresponding to the product with a marker and switch off the UV lamp to minimize damage from UV exposure.\nExcise and extract the RNA sample(s) from the PAGE gel: With a fresh razor blade for each sample, excise the desired product bands, dice into ~1 mm cubes, and add the gel pieces to a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube with 500 µL of crush soak buffer to extract RNA on a rotator for either 2 h at room temperature (RT) or overnight at 4 °C.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Optional pause point: the sample may be stored at −20 °C.\nPrecipitate the RNA",
    "To separate the gel pieces from the extracted RNA in buffer, centrifuge the sample at 13,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C, and then use a narrow-tip pipette to extract the supernatant and load it into a new 2 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nTo precipitate the RNA, add 1.5 mL of ice-cold ethanol and 1 µL of 20 mg/mL glycogen, vortex, and store for at least 1 h at −20 °C or −80 °C.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: Optional pause point: the RNA may be stored at −20 °C for a few months.\nCollection of RNA precipitate: Pellet the precipitated RNA by centrifugation at 13,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant and allow the remaining ethanol to evaporate under open air (~1 h) before resuspending the pellet in 30 µL of ddH2O or 1x TE buffer.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This process typically results in a final RNA concentration of ~10 µM.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Optional pause point: the RNA sample may be stored at −20 °C for a few months.\nDetermine the RNA stock concentrations.\n\t\t\nPrepare an RNA aliquot for the hydrolysis reaction.\n\t\t\t\nTo perform this assay, first, use a UV/Vis nano spectrophotometer to determine the A260 of the stock RNA sample and make a diluted aliquot of the sample to ~10 absorbance units (AU) in ddH2O.\nPrepare the following reaction in a 0.5 mL PCR tube: 16 µL of ddH2O + 2 µL of 10x Na2CO3 buffer + 2 µL of RNA aliquot diluted to ~10 AU. Incubate the reaction for 90 min at 95 °C, and then allow it to cool to RT.\nDetermine the RNA concentration using nucleotide absorbances: Measure the A260 of this sample with a UV/Vis nano spectrophotometer and calculate the RNA concentration using the following formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64367/64367eq01.jpg",
    "where c is the concentration of RNA, b is the path length, i is the specific nucleotide (A, C, G, or U), ni is the frequency of nucleotide i in the RNA sequence, and εi is the molar extinction coefficient of nucleotide i. To determine the original stock RNA concentration, multiply c by the dilution factor.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Optional pause point: The RNA may be stored at −20 °C for a few months.\nPerforming an in vitro plate reader kinetics assay\n\t\nSet up the RNA renaturation program: Create the following thermocycler protocol by selecting Create New Program > Add New Phase > Add New Step multiple times to add each of the following steps before pressing Save:\n\t\t70 °C for 3 min\n\t\t65 °C for 45 s\n\t\t60 °C for 45 s\n\t\t55 °C for 45 s\n\t\t50 °C for 45 s\n\t\t45 °C for 45 s\n\t\t40 °C for 45 s\n\t\t35 °C for 45 s\n\t\t30 °C for 45 s\nRenature the RNA: To renature Spinach2 and Broccoli RNAs, prepare 2 µM stocks of each RNA in ddH2O in a 0.5 mL thin-walled PCR tube, and then add an equal volume of 2x renaturation buffer (80 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 [KOH], 250 mM KCl, 6 mM MgCl2) to make 1 µM RNA solutions. Add the tubes to the thermocycler, open the saved renaturation program, and press Run.\n\t\tNOTE: If a thermocycler is unavailable, the RNAs may instead be incubated on a 70 °C heat block for 3 min and then allowed to cool slowly to RT on the bench.",
    "Prepare the binding reaction buffer: To prepare the buffer for one aptamer-dye binding reaction, make a master mix containing buffer components (69.5 µL of ddH2O + 4 µL of 1 M HEPES, pH 7.5 [KOH] + 6.2 µL of 2 M KCl + 0.3 µL of 1 M MgCl2). Depending on how many samples and replicates are needed, multiply these values by the number of samples plus one. Generally, three replicates per RNA sample is satisfactory.\nPrepare the plate reader.\n\t\t\nSet up the plate reader injector program: On the fluorescence plate reader, select Temp and set the desired temperature to 37 °C, making sure the temperature has equilibrated to this value well before starting kinetics experiments.
