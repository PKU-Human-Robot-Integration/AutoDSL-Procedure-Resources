    "Anesthesia for splenectomyPreparation for anesthesia and determination of sufficient anesthesia for splenectomy.Prepare a sufficient amount of isoflurane. Place into the liquid chamber of the vaporizer (Anaesthetics Vaporizer, Patterson Scientific, as operated by anesthesia technician, see Video 1.)<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Precision technique for mouse splenectomy. This video was made at CHOC Children’s Research Institute according to guidelines from the CHOC Children’s Research Institute on Animal Care and approved by the Animal Research Ethics Board of CHOC Children’s Research Institute under protocol IACUC#_160501.Anesthesia procedureAttach silicon tubing to induction chamber (red into induction chamber, purple leading out of induction chamber). Attach the long purple line to the vacuum system of the building.Turn on the waste pump, attach oxygen manifold to an oxygen tank.Turn on an oxygen tank, open oxygen flowmeter. Set the flow rate to 0.9 L/s for oxygen flow rate and 5% isoflurane. Open flow hose to the induction chamber.Place mouse into induction chamber. Observe for the mouse to begin to take deep breaths. The mouse is sufficiently anesthetized when breathing rate drops below 60 breaths per minute. Splenectomy procedurePreparation of surgeryAll surgical tools should be sterilized between surgeries appropriate with the nature of tools. Surgical instruments are set up on a sterile surgical table along with sterile supplies such as suture, non-absorbable, suture, forceps, a surgical knife, twisters, scissors. The anesthetized mouse is laid down on the table with nose encased within the nose cone supplying the inhalational gas for anesthesia. The skin is sterilized with iodine solution (ChloraPrepTM, and DuraPrepTM solution).Incision of skinA 0.5 cm skin incision is made in vertical midline abdomen just below the xyphoid process with fine scissors. The midline fascia is easily identified just under the skin incision, and scissors can be used to cut a midline incision for the same length.",
    "Note: Be careful to not go into the xyphoid cartilage or any higher so that there is no entry into the thorax, which will result in pneumothorax and death of the mouse. Mobilization of the spleenThe spleen is brought to the midline incision from the left upper quadrant by bringing out the omentum with the use of smooth forceps and a cotton tip applicator to drag it outward in view.The spleen is removed to separate from the stomachThe spleen is held up with the smooth forceps, and an eye cautery with a heated tip is utilized to cauterize the attachments and the vessels to the hilum. Often, this portion of handling the spleen and dividing the vessels can be traumatic and result in significant blood loss when performed by untrained or inexperienced individuals. The purpose of some of these simple techniques is to limit trauma and stress to the animal, which are critical factors in avoiding significant systemic responses which can grossly alter the inflammatory and immune response. It is critical to cauterizing attached vessels with a cautery pen using the splenic vessel-preserving technique (Kim et al., 2019).The midline fascial defect is closed with 4-0 vicryl sutures and skin is closed with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl suture with using Wire Twister for Neurosurgery. Five stitches are used to close the skin opening of 0.5 cm length. (It is the surgeon, who specified the type of knots for patient’s operation, namely, Surgical Tie–Instrument Technique that shows a simple square knot being tied with forceps as shown in the video clip).The mouse is anesthetized for a procedure that lasts about 5-10 min in duration, and the mouse is kept under the heat lamp to avoid hypothermia.",
    "Also, one cc of saline is given subcutaneously to replace some of the insensible fluid losses during surgery.Note: The Steps C2-C5 should be completed within 10 min.Recovery of post-splenectomyMice are observed for minutes after surgery to ensure adequate analgesia and again on hourly intervals during the day of surgery for 4 h. Animal appearance, activity, and behavior (e.g., food and water intake) are closely monitored as indications of pain and discomfort. The analgesic drug (Codeine, buprenex, oxycodone, morphine, hydromorphone, i.m. injection) is used if the animals appear in pain as evidenced by visual observation (jerking motions, lack of movement, significant weight loss, vocalizing, and lack of grooming, auditory observation of squealing) for 30 min and again in 4 h post-surgery.Codeine is given twice daily for first a few days after the surgery if needed. Post-Procedure Supportive Care: Appropriate food and water are ensured on the cage floor after the procedure. The wound sutures are absorbed through time. The analgesic, tranquilizing or neuromuscular blocking agent(s) and post-anaesthetics recovery: Ketamine/xylazine (dose: 120/20 mg/kg) or Codeine (1 mg/kg), are applied."
