    "Tumor cell preparationCulture tumor cells according to the indicated culture method.Note: 4T1, Cl66, and Cl66M2 murine breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231-Luc human breast cancer cells, and rat prostate cancer cells were used in the author’s previous studies. Aspirate the culture media and add PBS to rinse the cells.Aspirate PBS and add 0.25% trypsin/EDTA solution.Note: Ensure the solution covers the entire surface of the cells by tilting the culture plate. Incubate the cells at 37 °C for a few minutes in a humidified 5% CO2 environment.Add the culture media to neutralize the trypsin, detach the adherent cells by pipetting the media back and forth, and make a single cell suspension.Transfer the cell suspension to a 15 ml or 50 ml tube and centrifuge it at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Aspirate the supernatant, resuspend the cell pellet in cold PBS, and count the cell number.Centrifuge the cell suspension again and resuspend the cell pellet with cold Matrigel at 3 x 106 cells per 100 µl Matrigel.Note: Matrigel is a liquid at 4 °C. It polymerizes into a solid gel when maintained at 24-37 °C. Keep the resuspended cells on ice until the cells are implanted.Tumor cell implantation on mouse calvarial bone (Figure 2)Anatomy of mouse calvarial boneMouse calvarial bone is mainly composed of frontal, parietal and interparietal bones (Figures 1A and 1B). There are two major midline sutures: interfrontal suture between the paired frontal bones and sagittal suture between the paired parietal bones. In addition, there are two major transverse sutures: coronal sutures between the frontal and parietal bones and lambdoid sutures between the parietal and interparietal bones (Figure 1A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190128/20190128172807_1330.jpgFigure 1.

    "Anesthetize a mouse by intraperitoneal injection of anesthetic agents as previously reported (Kawai et al., 2011). Insert a 21 G needle into the forehead skin (Figure 2A, X: Needle insertion point) and scratch the periosteum of calvarial bone with the tip of the needle in order to expose the surface of bone (Figure 2B).Note: Complete exposure of bone surface is important for tumor implantation.  Transfer the cell suspension into a 1 ml syringe and attach a 23 G needle.Note: Ensure the cells are homogeneously suspended by pipetting up and down before the transfer.  Insert the injection needle from the same skin hole and inject 100 µl (3 x 106 cells) of the cell suspension over the calvarial bone (Figure 2C).After pulling the needle out, pinch the injection hole with fingers for about 30 sec until Matrigel polymerizes into a solid gel (Figures 2D and 2E).Note: Take care not to let the cell suspension leak through the hole. Place the injected mouse on a heating pad and monitor it until it completely becomes awake.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190128/20190128172826_0024.jpgFigure 2. Cancer cell implantation on mouse calvarial bone After implantationMonitor tumor growth regularly. Measure tumor size at the implanted site weekly with a vernier caliper.Perform IVIS in vivo imaging and micro-computed tomography (μCT) scanning weekly or every 2 weeks and check the size of tumor, osteolytic lesions or osteoblastic lesions (see Data analysis).Sacrifice the implanted mouse at approximately 3-6 weeks (based on μCT analysis) after the implantation and harvest the resulting tumor for further analyses (e.g., histological analysis and gene expression analysis).Note: At early time points, little or no change of the calvarial bone is observed. Osteolytic or osteoblastic lesions were visually identified at approximately 2-4 weeks (depend on implanted tumor cells) after the tumor cells are implanted."
