    "Day before the assay Hydrate the sensor cartridge in Seahorse XF calibrant solution according to the manufacturer’s instructions one day prior to measurement in a non-CO2 incubator.Turn on the XF24 analyzer to preheat the system to 37 °C.Day of the assay Sample preparation The previously cultivated wheat flowers (see Notes) are separated from a spike with a scalpel and the wheat paleae is then isolated from the flowers (Figure 1).Wash the wheat paleae five times in 1× PBS.After this step, the wheat paleae can be used directly for measurement or stored in 1.6% agarose at 4 °C until further use. The storage time at this temperature is seven days maximum (see Notes).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4767/bioprotoc-13-15-4767-g001.jpgFigure 1. Structure of a wheat flower. P = Paleae, L = Lemma, K = Caryopsis, G = Gluma. Scale bar = 2 mm. Figure from Glasenapp (2017).Assay Prepare the XF assay medium and heat to 37 °C.Take the wheat flower from the 1× PBS or agarose gel and wash it again five times in 1× PBS to remove any remaining impurities or residues of agarose (Figure 2A).After removing the lower as well as the upper part of the wheat paleae, wash again in 1× PBS (Figure 2C).Put the wheat paleae with its concave side (side with the wings) down, on a net [Figure 2B, 2C, and 2G (7–9)].It is important to ensure that the wings of the wheat paleae side are facing down towards the capture screen. This orientation is essential for the measurement, as the side facing the capture screen gets detected by the sensor (Figure 2G).Add 450 μL of XF assay medium into each well of the Islet Capture microplate.",
    "Incubate the Islet Capture microplate in the incubator (without CO2) at 37 ° C for 45 min to adjust the wheat paleae to the new XF assay medium.Load the injection ports of the sensor cartridge as programmed (see the programming of the XF controller), follow the instructions of the XF Analyzer, and start the calibration of the sensor cartridge.When calibration is complete, place the Islet Capture microplate in the XF Analyzer and start the measurement.Data analysis is performed with the Seahorse analysis software Wave.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4767/bioprotoc-13-15-4767-g002.jpgFigure 2. Microscopic image of wheat paleae in the XF24 Islet Capture microplate. The wheat paleae (A) must be placed on the net such that its upper side with its so-called wings points downwards in contact with the capture screen. The sample must then be placed in the multi-well plate, using the capture screen insert tool (B, C). Top view (D) and view from below (E) of wheat paleae inserted into the multi-well plate. The processed wheat paleae should cover the entire surface of the capture screen to ensure that the same area is always measured (D–F). The measurement of oxygen consumption takes place over the surface within the ring marked with the arrow (F). Schematic setup of the XF24 measuring system with an Islet Capture microplate (G). Scale bar = 2 mm.Programming the XF controller This section describes the individual program steps of the XF controller for measuring the OCR as shown in Figures 3 and 4. The stress reagents are diluted to a final concentration of 4 μM with XF assay medium. The concentration of oligomycin, FCCP, and rotenone/antimycin A should be determined in a preliminary experiment for the respective experimental conditions. The injection of the stress reagent should be simultaneously carried out in all wells. All measurements are done in several cycles.",
    "Each cycle involves 4 min mixing, 2 min waiting, and 3 min OCR and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR).Workflow of the XF controller Calibrate probes.Time of Delay: 15 min.First Loop: 3 times (Basal state).Mixing: 4 minTime of Delay: 2 minMeasurement: 3 minInjection of Port A (50 μL of oligomycin, 4 μM final concentration).Use oligomycin to block the ATP synthase.Then, the decrease in OCR corresponds to the amount of oxygen used for ATP synthesis.Second Loop: 6 times (decrease of ATP-linked respiration)Mixing: 4 minTime of Delay: 2 minMeasurement: 3 minInjection of Port B (55 μL of FCCP, 4 μM final concentration).The decoupling of the respiratory chain by FCCP allows the maximal respiration and the spare respiratory capacity to be determined independently of the proton gradient.Third Loop: 3 times (potentially uncoupled respiration).Mixing: 4 minTime of Delay: 2 minMeasurement: 3 minInjection of Port C (60 μL of rotenone/antimycin A, 4 μM final concentration).In the last Loop, complexes I and II are blocked by the addition of rotenone and antimycin A. The remaining oxygen consumption thus depends only on the non-mitochondrial respiration.Fourth Loop: 6 times (non-mitochondrial respiration).Mixing: 4 minTime of Delay: 2 minMeasurement: 3 minEnd of Program."
