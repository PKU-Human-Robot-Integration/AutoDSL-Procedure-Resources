    "All animal experiments are performed under the approval of the University of Michigan's Committee on the Use and Care of Animals.\nNOTE: Donor rats are allowed free access to food and water prior to skin and muscle donation procedures. Euthanasia is performed under deep anesthesia followed by intra-cardiac potassium chloride injection with a secondary method of bilateral pneumothorax. Any strain of rat can theoretically be utilized with this experiment; however, our laboratory has achieved consistent results in both male and female Fischer F344 rats (~200-250 g) at two to four months of age. Donor rats must be isogenic to the experimental rats.\n1. Preparation of the dermal graft\nAnesthetize donor rat in an induction chamber utilizing a solution of 5% isoflurane in oxygen at 0.8-1 L/min. Once the rat has been anesthetized, remove from induction chamber and place on a rebreathing nose cone, lowering the isoflurane to 2-2.5% for maintenance of anesthesia.\nAdminister a solution of 0.02-0.03 mL Carprofen (50 mg/mL) in 0.2 mL of sterile saline subcutaneously between the shoulder blades for analgesia.\nApply artificial tears ointment to both eyes to prevent corneal ulcers.\nUsing clippers, shave the entire lower hindlimb(s), ankle region, and sides of paw(s).\nCleanse chosen hindlimb and plantar surface of paw with alcohol, followed by iodopovidone solution, ending with a final cleanse with alcohol to remove residual iodopovidone.\nUsing a hand-held micro motor high speed drill with a removable round fine grit polishing stone (4000 rpm), burr the plantar surface of the paw to remove the epidermis. While burring, apply drips of saline as to not burn the skin. The underlying dermis will have a shiny appearance with pinpoint bleeding.\nApply a tourniquet to the lower extremity to slow blood flow.",
    "Remove the plantar skin sharply with a #15 scalpel and place in saline-moistened gauze to prevent desiccation. Some tendinous and connective tissue will inherently be removed with the skin in this step and will be removed later.\nApply gauze wrap to the bleeding foot to slow hemorrhage. Repeat steps 1.5-1.9 if doing two constructs.\nUnder a microscope (20x magnification), remove the tendinous and connective tissue from the deep layer of the skin graft using micro-scissors. Take care not to make holes in the graft. The thinned dermal graft should be slightly opaque containing only dermis, measuring approximately 0.5 cm x 1.0cm in size.\nPlace in saline-moistened gauze until ready for C-RPNI construct fabrication. Grafts should be utilized within 2 hours of harvest.\n2. Preparation of the muscle graft\nMake a longitudinal incision along the anterior aspect of the lower hindlimb from just above the ankle to just below the knee with a #15 scalpel. Dissect through subcutaneous tissue to expose the underlying musculature.\nAt the distal aspect of the incision, expose the tendinous insertions of the lower limb musculature. Tibialis anterior (TA) is typically the largest and most anterior of the muscles, and just underneath and posterior to this muscle lies the extensor digitorum longus (EDL). Isolate the distal EDL tendon from the other tendons in the area, taking care not to incise its insertion at this point.\nEnsure isolation of the correct tendon by inserting both tines of a forceps underneath the tendon and exerting upward pressure by opening the forceps to cause tendon excursion. Manipulation of this tendon should cause all of the toes to extend simultaneously.\nPerform a distal tenotomy with sharp iris scissors and separate the muscle from the surrounding tissues bluntly with tenotomies (or other blunt-tipped scissor) working proximally to find the tendinous origin.",
    "Once the proximal tendon is visualized, again perform a tenotomy utilizing sharp iris scissors. Place the muscle graft in a saline-moistened gauze to prevent desiccation.\nOnce all desired grafts have been removed from a donor rat, euthanize primarily by intra-cardiac KCl injection (1-2 mEq K+/kg) followed by secondary euthanasia with bilateral puncture pneumothorax with a #15 blade.\n3. Common peroneal nerve isolation and preparation\nAnesthetize and provide analgesia to the experimental rat according to protocol outlined in steps 1.1-1.3.\nShave the desired thigh and cleanse with alcohol, betadine, ending with alcohol to remove traces of betadine.\nMove animal from surgical prep table to surgical microscope table and place on heating pad with temperature probe for body temperature maintenance. Maintain isoflurane at 2-2.5% and oxygen at 0.8-1 L/min.\nMark the incision, extending from just distal to sciatic notch to the inferior portion of the knee. This marking should be inferior to, and angled away from, the femur. Make the incision with a #15 blade incising through the underlying biceps femoris fascia.\nCarefully dissect through the biceps femoris muscle with either a hemostat or blunt-tipped micro-scissors to the space underlying biceps femoris.\n\tNOTE: The sciatic nerve travels approximately in the same direction as the initial incision that was made. There are three branches, typically with sural nerve posterior and common peroneal and tibial nerve traveling superficial and deep to the knee, respectively.\nFollowing identification of the common peroneal (CP) nerve, using a pair of micro-, fine-tipped forceps and micro-scissors, carefully isolate the CP nerve from the other sciatic branches and remove any lingering connective tissue distally.\nAt the point where the nerve crosses the surface of the knee, sharply transect the nerve with a pair of micro-scissors.",
    "NOTE: Using sharp scissors is extremely important in this step as causing significant trauma to the nerve could increase the risk of neuroma formation.\nCarefully free any remaining connective tissue from the CP nerve and work proximally to free the nerve to a length of approximately 2 cm.\n4. C-RPNI construct fabrication\nRemove the muscle graft from saline-moistened gauze and remove all central tendinous tissue as well as a small central segment of epimysium. Leave the tendinous ends intact.\nUsing an 8-0 nylon suture, secure the epineurium of the transected end of the CP nerve to the area of the muscle graft devoid of epimysium with two interrupted stitches on either side of the nerve.\nSecure the muscle graft to the femur periosteum with a single 6-0 nylon interrupted stitch both proximally and distally with the nerve-muscle junction facing away from the femur.\n\tNOTE: Secure the muscle so that it is at normal relaxed length. Try not to stretch the muscle significantly or leave too much laxity when securing.\nPlace an 8-0 nylon stitch at the inferior, central margin of the muscle graft epimysium, securing it to the CP nerve epineurium in a way as to create laxity in the nerve within the muscle graft and help to relieve any future tension it may be exposed to with later ambulation.\nRemove the skin graft from the saline-moistened gauze and arrange it on the muscle graft in such a way to completely cover the nerve and the majority of the muscle. Ensure that the deep margin of the dermis is resting on the muscle. Trim any dermis that extends beyond the border of the muscle.",
    "Secure the skin graft to the muscle graft circumferentially using 8-0 nylon interrupted sutures. Typically, 4-8 total sutures are used depending on the size of the construct.\nClose the biceps femoris fascia over the construct in a running fashion with 5-0 chromic suture.\nClose the overlying skin with 4-0 chromic suture in running fashion.\nSwab the surgical area with an alcohol pad and apply antibiotic ointment.\nCease inhalational anesthetic and allow rat to recover with food and water sources separate from cage mates.\nSubscription Required.
