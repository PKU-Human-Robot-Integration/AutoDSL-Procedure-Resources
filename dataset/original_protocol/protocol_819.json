    "**Preparation of culture medium**\n・MEF medium: Mix 500 ml of DMEM, FCS 50 ml, 5 ml of L-Glutamine and 5 ml of Penicillin-Streptomycin solution. Store the solution at 4℃ up to 1 mo.\n・Modified cmPSC medium: Mix 37.6 ml of Essential 8 medium, 2 ml of KSR, 400 µl of Penicillin-Streptomycin solution and 2.5µM IWR1. Store the solution at 4℃ up to 2 wk.\n・aRB27: Mix 28.8ml of Advanced RPMI 1640 medium, 300 µl of B27, 300 µl of NEAA, 300 µl of L-Glutamine and 300 µl of Penicillin-Streptomycin solution. Store the solution at 4℃ up to 1 wk.\n・ME medium: Mix 10 ml of aRB27, 100 ng/ml Activin A, 3 µM CHIR99021 and 10 µM Y-27632. Freshly prepare the medium before use.\n*For lateral mesoderm \\(LM) induction, addition of 100 ng/ml BMP2 in ME medium enhances the induction efficiency.\n・PGC medium: Mix 10 ml of aRB27, 500 ng/ml BMP2, 10 ng/ml hLIF, 100 ng/ml mSCF, 50 ng/ml mEGF and 10 µM Y-27632. Freshly prepare the medium before use.\n*Option \\(recommended); add 2.5% PVA into PGC medium to increase the efficiency of aggregation.\n・10% \\(wt/vol) stock solution of PVA: Gradually add 2 g of PVA to 20 ml water \\(tissue culture grade) with vigorous shaking and leave it at 4℃ for a few hours. Then, the solution is warmed in 37℃ water bath overnight to facilitate solubilization. For sterilization, filtrate 0.45 µm filter and store it at cold room at least 3 mo. For 10 ml of PGC medium, add 250 µl of 10% PVA stock. \n・DE medium: Mix 10 ml of aRB27, 100  ng/ml Activin A and 0.5 µM LDN193189.\n・LM medium: Mix 10 ml of aRB27, 100 ng/ml BMP2, 10 µM SB431542 and 2.5 µM IWR1.\n**1. Culture of PSC**",
    "Human pluripotent stem cells \\(hPSCs) are maintained in Essential 8 medium10 on vitronectin-coated dish according to the manufacture’s protocol \\(https://www.thermofisher.com/uk/en/home/references/protocols/cell-culture/stem-cell-protocols/ipsc-protocols/culturing-puripotent-stem-cells-essential-8-medium.html). Alternatively, we found mTeSR1 medium \\(Stem Cell Technologies) and Geltrex\\(Thermo Fisher scientific)-coated dish are also suitable for this purpose. Routine cultures of hPSCs are maintained by passaging after dissociation of cells with 0.5mM EDTA after every 3-5 days.\n  Cynomolgus monkey PSCs \\(cmPSCs) are cultured in modified cmPSC medium on MMC-treated or irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblast \\(MEF: lower density, approximately 2x10e5 cells/well \\(6well plate)). cmPSCs are routinely passaged with 0.25% trypsin/EDTA to dissociate them into single cells every 3-5 days. Thereafter, dissociated cells are cultured following addition of 10 µM Y-27632 in modified cmPSCs medium.\n  Although both hPSC and cmPSC can be maintained in conventional PSC medium such as DMEM/F12 supplemented with 20%KSR and 10-20 ng/ml bFGF on MEF, in our experience, the induction efficiency of these cells for ME and PGC was more variable and inconsistent. Cells from conventional medium could be switched to the optimal conditions described above by passaging for two times or more, prior to the induction of ME and PGC.\n**2. Induction of ME**\n1. Aspirate medium and wash PSCs with 1 ml of PBS.\n  2. Add 0.2-0.3 ml 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA\n  3. Incubate at 37℃ for 3 min\n  4. Add 1ml of MEF medium while pipetting until cells are dissociated into single cells.\n  \\(Optional: use 50-70 µm cell strainer to remove cell clumps.)\n5. Centrifuge at 1,200 rpm for 4-5 min.\n  6. Aspirate supernatant and suspend cells in ME medium \\(0.2-1 ml)\n  7. Subject cells to pipetting a few times.\n  8. Count the number of cells.\n  9. Seed 2x10e5 cells/well \\(12well plate) on vitronectin-coated plate.\n  10. Use at <sub>12 h \\(Pre-ME) for hPGC induction and at </sub>24-30 h \\(ME) for DE/LM induction",
    "\\(Caution: the precise timings might vary with different cell lines or culture conditions) \n**3. Induction of PGC from Pre-ME**\n11. Aspirate medium and wash cells \\(Pre-ME cells: normally 12 h after ME induction) with 0.5-1 ml of PBS.\n  12. Add 0.2-0.3 ml 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA\n  13. Incubate at 37℃ for 3 min\n  ・Add 1ml of MEF medium and dissociate into single cells by repeated pipetting\n\\(Optional: use 50-70 µm cell strainer to remove cell clumps.)\n14. Centrifuge at 1,200 rpm for 4-5 min.\n  15. Aspirate supernatant and suspend cells in PGC medium \\(100 µl)\n  16. Pipette cells few times.\n  17. Count the number of cells.\n  18. Dilute the cell suspension with PGC medium to and adjust the concentration of  cells to 4x10e3 cells/100 µl/well.\n  19. Add 100 µl of the cell suspension into a single well of Corning® Costar® Ultra-Low attachment multiwell plates.\n  20. Centrifuge the plate at 1,200 rpm for 1-2 min to ‘aggregate’ the cells to the bottom of the wells\n  21. Culture for 2-5 days.\n  \n**4. Induction of DE and LM**\n22. Aspirate medium and wash cells \\(ME cells: normally 24-30h after ME induction) with 0.5-1 ml of PBS.\n  23. Add 1 ml of DE or LM medium\n  24. Culture for 2-3 days \\(DE) or for 1-2 days \\(LM)\n  *We confirmed that paraxial mesoderm can also be induced from ME by activation of WNT signaling \\(3 µM CHIR99021) and suppression of ACTIVIN and BMP signaling \\(10 µM SB431542 and 0.5 µM LDN193189) at high efficiency \\(80%< CXCR +ve, CDX2 +ve), as shown in previous report11."
