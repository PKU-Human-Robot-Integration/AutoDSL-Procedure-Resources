    "1. Determination of Puromycilation Conditions\nNOTE: This technique describes the method used to assess localized translation during the MRC-5 cell adhesion process5. As puromycilation can be done in any cell, it is important to optimize the puromycilation conditions for the specific cell lines to be used, because the treatment conditions are not identical for each cell line in terms of the puromycin concentration and the desired incubation time. To show how these conditions are defined, three example cell lines (i.e., HeLa, MRC-5, and Huh-7) were treated with increasing concentrations of puromycin for different incubation times (Figure 1).\nGrow identical numbers of cells in a 24-well plate in 0.5 mL of the appropriate complete culture medium 16 h before the test. Seed 30,000 MRC-5 cells, 50,000 HeLa cells, or 50,000 HuH-7 cells per well. Make sure to avoid exceeding 60-70% confluence (Figure 1A).\nPrepare 6 tubes with 1.5 mL of complete cell culture medium with increasing concentrations of puromycin (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 µg/mL). Pre-warm at 37 °C.\nFor each concentration of puromycin medium (prepared in step 1.2), transfer 0.5 mL from each tube into 6 new tubes and add cycloheximide at a final concentration of 50 µg/mL to all 6 new tubes. Pre-warm at 37 °C.\nChange the medium with 0.5 mL of complete culture medium (row 1 and 2). For the third row, add 0.5 mL of complete culture medium supplemented with 50 µg/mL of cycloheximide (Figure 1B).\n\tNOTE: Cycloheximide treatment has been established as the best negative control for protein puromycilation due to its ability to block translation elongation. Because puromycin incorporation requires translation elongation, cycloheximide treatment leads to a loss of puromycilated protein signals5,18.\nIncubate for 15 min at 37 °C (5% CO2).",
    "Add 0.5 mL of the puromycin medium prepared in step 1.2 to the second row to obtain final concentrations of 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, and 15 µg/mL, respectively, in columns A, B, C, D, E, and F. At the same time, add 0.5 mL of puromycin to the cycloheximide-supplemented medium (step 1.3) in the third row (Figure 1C).\nIncubate for 5 min at 37 °C (5% CO2).\nAdd 0.5 mL of the puromycin medium prepared in step 1.2 to the first row to obtain final concentrations of 0.0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, and 15 µg/mL (Figure 1C).\nIncubate for 5 min at 37 °C (5% CO2).\nWash each well from rows 1 to 3 with 1 mL of ice-cold 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 5 min after the addition of puromycin to wells of the first row (wash twice). Add 75 µL of 1X Laemmli buffer (4% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.120 M Tris HCl pH 6.8, 0.004% bromophenol blue, and 10% glycerol) to obtain whole-cell lysates for each condition.\nRun 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using 1/3 of the prepared samples to assess puromycin incorporation.\n\t\nDetermine the level of puromycin incorporation by Western blot analysis using an anti-puromycin antibody (12D10) diluted at a ratio of 1:25,000 in primary antibody incubation buffer (2% bovine serum albumin (BSA)), 430 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris pH 7.4, and 0.01% sodium azide).\n\t\tNOTE: Representative images corresponding to different cell line extracts made as described in step 1 are shown as examples in Figure 2.\n2. In Cellulo Localized Translation Visualization\nNOTE: The technique described here was used to assess localized translation within SICs in MRC-5 cells during the adhesion process5. Although MRC-5 cells are used here, other cell lines can be used with the same methodology described in step 2.1.",
    "Cell preparation.\nDetach MRC-5 cells using 0.25% trypsin/2.21 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). Pellet the cells by centrifugation (5 min at 200 x g) in a 15-mL conical centrifuge tube and suspend them in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 40,000 cells/mL after counting with a counting chamber.\nIncubate the suspended cells at 37 °C under gentle rotation using a tube rotator for 20 min to maintain them in suspension.\n\t\tNOTE: This step is critical to allow for the complete dissociation of the focal adhesion complexes.\nPlate 2 mL of suspended MRC-5 cells (40,000 cells/mL) in two 35-mm glass-bottom dishes. Use the first 35-mm glass-bottom dish for the puromycilation assay (see step 2.1.5) and use the second as a negative control (see step 2.1.6).\nKeep the cells at 37 °C (5% CO2) for 55 min to allow for cellular adhesion and SIC formation.\nAdd puromycin to the medium in the 35-mm glass-bottom dishes (assay) using the concentration previously defined in section 1. To treat MRC-5 cells, use 10 µg/mL puromycin for 5 min at 37 °C (5% CO2).\nAs a negative control, add cycloheximide to the second 35-mm glass-bottom dish 40 min after seeding the cells to pre-treat them with 50 µg/mL cycloheximide (Figure 2B). Then, 15 min after cycloheximide addition, add puromycin to the medium using the same concentration and incubation time as in step 2.1.5 (e.g., use 10 µg/mL of puromycin for 5 min at 37 °C (5% CO2) for MRC-5).\nWash each plate twice with 2 mL of ice-cold 1X PBS and fix the cells with 1 mL of 4% formaldehyde (diluted in 1X PBS) for 15 min at room temperature (RT).\n\t\tCaution: Paraformaldehyde must be used strictly in a chemical hood.\nImmunostaining.",
    "Following paraformaldehyde fixation, wash three times with 2 mL of 1X PBS and incubate in 500 µL of PBS-TritonX-100 (0.5%) for 20 min at RT to permeabilize the cells.\nTo prevent nonspecific antibody binding, block the sample with 500 µL PBS – BSA (1%) for 20 min at RT.\nWash three times with 2 mL of PBS-Tween20 (0.1%) and incubate with 300 µL of anti-puromycin antibody (12D10) diluted 1:12,500 in 1X PBS for 1 h at RT.\nWash 3 times with 2 mL of PBS-Tween20 (0.1%) and incubate with 300 µL of anti-mouse IgG conjugated to a fluorophore (here, 488 nm) diluted in PBS to visualize puromycilated polypeptides and with phalloidin-conjugated to another fluorophore (here, 555 nm) to visualize F-actin. Incubate for 1 h at RT.\nWash three times with 2 mL of PBS-Tween20 (0.1%) and then incubate for 5 min at RT in 300 µL of PBS-Tween20 (0.1%) supplemented with 1 µg/mL 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).\nWash three times with 2 mL of PBS-Tween20 (0.1%) and then wash with 2 mL of 1X PBS. Prevent the cells from drying by keeping the sample in 2 mL of 1X PBS during image acquisition.\n3. Immunofluorescent Image Acquisition\nNOTE: The following methodology can be used with any commercially available confocal imaging system.\nDetermine the appropriate settings for each fluorophore to maximize the dynamic range for quantification.\n\tNOTE: Representative quantification can only be obtained if pixel saturation is avoided and the signal threshold is adjusted properly. These settings can be attained by carefully adjusting the laser power, high voltage (HV), gain, and offset.\n\t\nAdjust the zoom factor (5X) and the number of pixels (512 x 512) to optimize the pixel size.\n\t\tNOTE: This should be at least 2.3-times smaller than the optical resolution, according to the Nyquist theorem.",
    "Decrease the scan speed (12.5-20 µs/pixel) and use averaging (2-3 times) to improve the signal-to-noise ratio according to the settings mentioned above.\nManually determine the appropriate top and bottom focal planes along the Z-axis with the optimal step size (0.4 µm/slice).\n\tNOTE: The step size plane is determined by the axial resolution divided by 2.3, according to the Nyquist theorem. Typically, 20-25 layers are necessary to cover the entire cell depth of adherent cells.\nAcquire a confocal image of an entire single cell with a 60X Plan Apo oil immersion objective (1.42 numerical aperture).\n4. Immunofluorescent Image Quantification\nDetermination of enrichment.\nOpen an image corresponding to the z-plane layer of interest from the acquired cell data file using the ImageJ software (freeware available at http://fiji.sc).\nDraw a line using the line drawing tool (Tool bar → Straight) through the regions of the cell where quantification is desired. Modify the line width by double-clicking on \"straight;\" the intensity values will be averaged through the width of the line (set at 8 in Figure 3).\n\t\tNOTE: A thinner line is preferred to avoid signal overlap from different structures.\nAfter the line is properly set, profile the signal density along the determined axis (menu bar → Analyze → Plot Profile).\n\t\tNOTE: A new window will open that shows a profile corresponding to the signal intensity for each pixel of the selected channel (specific fluorophore) along the line for the selected z-plane section.\n\t\t\nRepeat the process for each channel corresponding to the fluorophore used (i.e., one quantification for 488, one for 568, and one for 405).\n\t\t\tNOTE: The signal intensity value will always be ordered following the orientation of the drawn line.",
    "To obtain the numerical gray-scaled values for each pixel of the profile corresponding to the quantifications of the selected z-plane layer, copy the profile data (menu bar in image window → Copy) and paste it in any spreadsheet software.\nRepeat steps 4.1.1-4.1.4 for each z-plane section of the acquired confocal image and each channel where quantification is desired.\n\t\tNOTE: The quantification of different z-plane layers can be pooled to obtain a general assessment of the special enrichment of the signal by calculating the sum value of each pixel along the line for each z-plane layer. This type of pooling can only be achieved if the line drawn is identical for each z-plane layer included in the mean values.\nAs an alternative method for the whole-cell quantification of different channels with a large number of layers, use the macro called StackprofileData (see the Supplemental File).\n\t\tNOTE: This macro is accessible freely at https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/macros/StackProfileData.txt and can be used as follows:\n\t\t\nPaste the macro into a text file and save it.\nOpen the image file that includes all of the confocal layers of the cell.\nDraw a line, as described in step 4.1.2, open a new window to import the macro (menu bar → Plugins → Macros→ Run), choose the previously saved text file corresponding to the StackprofileData macro, and click \"Open.\"\n\t\t\tNOTE: Following macro importation, a new window named \"Results\" will open and all of the quantification along the determined axis will be listed for each z-plane layer and channel present in the image files.",
    "Copy the data for each channel (menu bar → Edit → Copy) to obtain the graphical profile representation corresponding to the signal quantifications. Paste it into any spreadsheet software. Calculate the sum value of each channel for each pixel along the line for each z-plane layer. Use these values to create a graphical representation similar to the one presented in Figure 3.\nQuantification of signal in a designated cellular area or volume.\nOpen the image file with ImageJ software.\nDraw an area to denote the area of interest using the geometrical form function (tool bar →\"rectangle,\" \"oval,\" or \"polygon\").\n\t\tNOTE: The quantification value will be determined for the area corresponding to the drawn form.\nAdjust the threshold level to avoid any background signal (menu bar → Image Adjust → Threshold); a new window will appear to represent the pixel intensities in histogram form. Change the values to include/exclude pixels in the quantification using the slider. Select a threshold that eliminates red pixels outside the cell, as pixels highlighted in red will be included in the quantification.\nDefine the measurement parameters to quantify the pixel signal within the selected area, without background signal (menu bar → Analyze → Set Measurements), and make sure to check the \"Limit to Threshold\" and the \"Integrated Density\" boxes.\nMeasure the quantitative values for the selected area (menu bar → Analyze → Measure).\n\t\tNOTE: Signal intensity quantification will be presented in a new window under the \"IntDen\" identification, which represents the product of the mean gray values and the number of pixels within the selected area.",
    "Draw an area that includes the entire cell using a geometrical form (tool bar →\"rectangle,\" \"oval,\" or \"polygon\") and proceed with steps 4.2.3-4.2.5 to obtain a value corresponding to the total signal. Calculate the ratio of the signal within the selected area over the whole signal to obtain the percent of the signal within the area of interest.\nRepeat steps 4.2.2-4.2.6 to obtain the quantification of cell volume for each z-plane. Adapt the geometrical form as needed.\nCopy/paste the data obtained from the \"Results\" windows for each z-plane layer into a spreadsheet for graphical depiction and to find a mean value.\nSubscription Required.
