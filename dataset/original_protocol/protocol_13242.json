    "The clinical study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Clinical Research Approval Committee of the Department of Respiratory Medicine, Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Record No. KY 2022010).\n1. Equipment preparation\nPrepare disposable sterile acupuncture needles (size 0.25 mm x 40 mm), moxa sticks (size 1.2 cm x 1.2 cm), medical sterilization swabs, iodophor swabs, lighter, and several 60 mm x 60 mm cardboards (see Figure 1).\n2. Doctor preparation\nEnsure that patients meet the diagnostic criteria for COPD in the Primary Care Guidelines for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and have abdominal distension.\nExclude patients with the following conditions:(1) those with skin ulceration, poor glycemic control, poor blood pressure control, and dizziness; (2) those with silicosis, tuberculosis, malignant tumors, asthma, coagulation disorders, and severe cardiac insufficiency; (3) those with rheumatic heart disease, congenital heart disease, renal failure, liver failure, and so on; (4) those with poor compliance.\nWear a medical mask and hat.\nWash the hands with soapy water, leave them dry, and use alcohol hand sanitizer before holding the needle to operate.\n3. Patient preparation\nAsk the patient to empty the bladder.\nMeasure the patient's blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation.\nMake sure the skin is not damaged and festering.\nAfter the above basic signs are normal, instruct the patient to choose the supine or prone position to expose the acupuncture points.\nAdvise the patient to inform the physician in case of discomfort during the procedure.\n4. Acupoints selection\nWipe the skin of the sites to be needled with Iodophor swabs.\nAccording to the standardized acupuncture points, choose Feishu (BL13), Taiyuan (LU9), Dingchuan (EX-B1), Zusanli (ST36), Zhongwan (RN12), Tianshu (ST25)24,25,26 (see Figure 2).\n5. Acupuncture and needling manipulation",
    "Stretch out flat the five fingers of the left hand, and place apart the index and middle fingers at the place of stabbing.\nHold the needle handle by the thumb and index finger of the right hand, the end of the middle finger is close to the point, and the finger belly is against the needle body.\nPress downward the thumb and index finger while the middle finger is flexed and insert the needle into the international standardized acupuncture angles and depths.\nUniformly lift and thrust the needle handle along the acupuncture angle, the depth is about 3 mm, and the frequency is about 60 times/min27.\nRotate the needle handle forward and backward at an angle of 180 degrees or less; the frequency is about 60 times/min until the patient feels De-qi27.\n6. Place moxa sticks\nLit the moxa sticks from the bottom 2-3 cm from the skin28 so that the patient has a warm sensation and redness on the body surface. Treatment takes about 30 min.\n7. Place cardboards\nPlace the 60 mm x 60 mm cardboard under the moxa sticks to prevent the ash from burning the skin until the moxa sticks burn out (see Figure 3).\n8. Picking the needles\nGently pick up the burned-out moxa sticks with the end of the bamboo swab.\nGently apply pressure to the needle sites with medical sterilization swabs in the hand.\nDo a small twist with the needles and slowly lift them to the subcutaneous, leave them for a moment, and then remove them.\nAfter the needles come out, use medical sterilization swabs to lightly press the needle holes for a moment to prevent bleeding and reduce pain.",
    "After the needles are withdrawn, carefully check whether the needle holes are bleeding, ask the patient whether there is any discomfort, and check whether the number of needles is missing.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
