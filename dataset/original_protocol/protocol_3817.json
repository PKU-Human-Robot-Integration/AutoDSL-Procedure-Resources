The experiments should be performed in accordance with relevant local guidelines and regulations.\nStoring patient material for future implantation\nCritical: Being as fast as possible when taking tumor material for storage will increase the probability of successful subsequent tumor implantation.\nEuthanize the tumor-bearing animal by exposure to gradually increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide and then surgically resect the xenograft. We implant xenografts subcutaneously, although they can also be implanted orthotopically in the mammary fat pad (Vareslija, Cocchiglia et al. 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nClean the tumor by placing it in a petri dish containing DMEM (without any supplements).\nCut the tumor into ∼1 cm3 pieces, see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/735-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Tumor pieces collected from a xenograft before cryopreservation\nStore the 1 cm3 fragments in 1 mL 1% DMSO - FBS solution (heat inactivated) in cryovials, usually 5 to 10 pieces in 1 mL of media.\nSlowly freeze the samples in a container that allows a cooling rate of 1°C/min until the temperature reaches −80°C.\nAfter 24 hours, store the vials in a −80°C freezer, or in liquid nitrogen.\nPreparing tumor material for implantation\nCritical: Implanting the material as fast as possible following thawing will increase the probability of successful subsequent tumor implantation. Avoid implanting fragments that contain traces of fat or are spongy. Defrost the Matrigel the day before at 4°C, and add Matrigel immediately prior to implantation.",
    "Defrost the cryovials containing the tumor fragments (usually 5 to 10 pieces) by placing the vial in a tissue culture incubator at 37°C for 5 min, see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nOpen the vial in a cell culture hood and transfer the fragments into a petri dish containing 1 mL of DMEM medium (lacking supplements or FBS) to wash out the DMSO.\nTransfer the fragments into an Eppendorf tube containing 500 μl of DMEM (lacking supplements or FBS).\nOnce the mouse is prepared as in 3 immerse the fragment in Matrigel and proceed to implantation, one 1 cm3 piece per mouse.\nImplantation of tumor material\nCritical: Implanting the material as fast as possible will increase the probability of successful tumor implantation. We recommend implanting up to 5 mice in one session.\nAnesthetize 6–8-week-old female NSG (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ, Charles River) mice using 1%–2% isoflurane (Isoflo, Abbotts Laboratories Ltd, Maidenhead, UK) in air/O2 (75/25% vol/vol, 2 L/min).\nAdminister analgesia, for example Vetergesic (Alstoe, York, UK), and Rimadyl LA (Pfizer, New York, USA).\nShave the mouse abdomen with clippers, see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/735-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Shaved area in the mid-lateral abdomen\nThis is ready to be cleaned and an incision made for implantation of a patient-derived tumor fragment.\nScrub the abdomen with iodine to sterilize.\nMake an incision with scissors parallel to the long axis of the mouse body. See Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] for the site of tumor implantation. Implanting the tumor at this site reduces the effect of respiratory motion on acquisition of 13C magnetic resonance images and spectra. Try to cut as small an incision as possible.\nClean and open the incision with a cotton wool bud soaked in PBS.\nLoosen the skin with scissors and insert one fragment per mouse.",
    "Take each side of the skin and cover the implanted tissue, closing the wound with tissue glue (GLUture).\nLet the animal recover in a heated box at 37°C.\nGeneration of breast cancer cell line xenografts\nTiming: [∼15 min]\nPreparing cell material for implantation (into 5 animals in this example)\nCritical: Defrost Matrigel the day before at 4°C. As it can solidify very quickly Matrigel is added to the cell suspension immediately prior to subcutaneous injection of the cell preparation.\nWash cells growing in 3 to 5 T-75 flasks, and which are 80% confluent, with 5 mL of PBS per flask.\nAdd 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution per flask.\nIncubate in a tissue culture incubator at 37°C for 5 to 10 min until the cells have detached.\nAdd 5 mL per flask of medium containing FBS, to inactivate the trypsin, and place the suspension in a 50 mL falcon tube.\nCentrifuge at 1000 × g for 3 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 20 mL of fresh medium.\nUse a small volume to calculate cell viability and density. This could be done by using, for example, a Vi-CELL Blu analyzer (Beckman Coulter) that uses the Trypan Blue Dye Exclusion method for assessing cell viability.\nTake the volume that corresponds to 5 × 106 cells and place in a 15 mL falcon tube.\nCentrifuge at 1000 × g for 3 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend in 500 μl of PBS.\nTransfer to an Eppendorf tube and place on ice.",
    "Add Matrigel (1:1 vol:vol) and keep the tube on ice. The samples are now ready to be implanted; 150 μl to 200 μl per mouse via subcutaneous injection, in the same location as in 3 g – see Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], using a 1 mL syringe and a 30G needle.\nNote: Some breast cancer cell lines require estradiol for growth. This can be provided via the drinking water or via prior implantation of an estrogen pellet.\nIf using estradiol pellets we recommend implanting one pellet per mouse (0.72 mg 17β-Estradiol 0.72 mg, 90 Day Release from Innovative Research of America (Cat# NE-121)). Subcutaneous implantation is performed as described in 3. We recommend implantation on the opposite flank from the tumor, four to six days prior to subcutaneous cell/tumor fragment implantation.\nIf using estradiol in the drinking water (5 μg/mL). Make up a stock of ß-estradiol (Cat#E2758 from Sigma-Aldrich) in ethanol (Cat#51976 from Sigma-Aldrich) at 5 mg/mL and then add 300 μL of this stock to 300 mL of drinking water. We recommend starting treatment four to six days prior to subcutaneous cell/tumor fragment implantation.\nImaging\nTiming: [2 to 3 hours per mouse]\nTiming: [15 min] for step 5\nTiming: [∼10 min] for step 6\nTiming: [∼45 min] for step 7\nTiming: [∼45 min] for step 8\nTiming: [∼10 min] for step 9\nTiming: [∼10 min] for step 10\nPreparing the mouse for the imaging session We do not routinely fast animals before imaging. However, low intra-individual variability and a higher [1-13C]lactate/[1-13C]pyruvate signal ratio has been reported for a murine lymphoma model implanted subcutaneously if the mice were fasted for 18 hours prior to imaging (Serrao, Rodrigues et al. 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).",
    "When a tumor is approximately 0.6–1.2 cm3 in volume, measured using calipers (1/2 × (length × width2)) it is ready for imaging. For established breast cancer cell line tumor models this volume is reached typically after 2–4 months, for breast cancer PDX models this could be 2–8 months, depending on the model. Tumors smaller than 0.6 cm3 can be imaged, although low signal-to-noise ratios might compromise the results obtained.\nPrepare a tail vein cannula using fine bore polyethene tubing. At one end insert a 30G needle and attach a 1 mL syringe containing Vetivex and Heparin, prepared previously by adding 5000 units of Heparin to 100 mL of Vetivex. At the other end insert the blunt end of a 30G needle, after removing the needle from the plastic mount.\nAnesthetize the mouse using 1%–2% isoflurane in air/O2 (75/25% vol/vol, 2 L/min).\nInsert the cannula prepared in b into the lateral tail vein.\nIf cannulation is successful, you will usually see blood refluxing (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Fix the cannula using some autoclave tape (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/735-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Tail vein cannulation of a mouse with a tumor\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/735-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Fixation of the cannula using autoclave tape\nTake the plunger of a 1 mL syringe and place it alongside the tail (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Fix in place with autoclave tape (this will ensure that the tail does not move during injection).\nPreparing the pyruvate sample for hyperpolarization",
    "Weigh out 44 mg (˜36 μL) of the mixture of pyruvic acid, containing 15 mmol/L of trityl radical (tris (8-carboxy-2,2,6,6-tetra-(hydroxyethyl)-benzo-[1,2-4,50]-bis-(1,3)-dithiole-4-yl)-methyl sodium salt (OX063); GE Healthcare, Amersham, UK), prepared as described above and transfer to an Eppendorf tube. This pyruvic acid and trityl radical solution can be stored at −80°C for several months, but if defrosted the aliquot can be stored at 4°C and should be used within a month.\nAdd 1 μL of a 50 mM gadolinium chelate solution: (gadoterate meglumine (Dotarem), Guerbet, Roissy, France) prepared previously in water to the Eppendorf tube to give ∼1.35 mM gadoterate meglumine and mix well.\nPipette the solution into a hyperpolarizer sample cup, avoiding the formation of bubbles (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/735-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Sample cup for an Oxford Instruments Hypersense polarizer\nPolarizing the pyruvate sample\nCool down the 3.35 T Oxford Instruments Hypersense polarizer (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/735-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. The Hypersense Hyperpolariser\nInsert the sample cup.\nThe microwave frequency should be swept for a representative sample to determine the optimal polarization frequency. For these samples a 180 s irradiation at 4 MHz intervals over a range of frequencies. On our system 94.09 to 94.13 GHz is sufficient, although the user should make sure this range contains the frequency given in the installation information sheet for each hyperpolariser. Frequency sweeps should be started once the helium level in the variable temperature insert (VTI) has reached the set point (usually 55%).\nWhen an optimal frequency has been determined (i.e., the frequency that gives the maximum solid state 13C polarization) this can be used for all subsequent measurements with the stock solution of [1-13C]pyruvic acid and OX063.",
    "The sample is polarized at the optimal microwave frequency (approx. 94.1GHz) for at least half an hour with sampling of the solid state 13C NMR signal every 300 s. A 45-min polarization at the optimal frequency and 1.25°K should achieve >90% of the possible polarization (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7], for more detail see Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]). The solid-state polarization build-up can be viewed in the Hypersense software, although optimal polarization is reached after 30 to 45 min, and as shown in Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10] the polarized sample can be kept for longer until ready to be used.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/735-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. The Hypersense software interface at the start of polarization\nPlacing the animal in the magnet and setting up the transmit and receiver coils. This step can be performed while the sample is polarizing. Spectra in this publication were acquired at 7.0 T using an Agilent scanner (Palo Alto, CA) running Vnmrj 3.1 software. However, similar experiments have been performed on other vendor instruments at fields of between 1 T and in excess of 9.4 T ((Day, Kettunen et al. 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2], Hill, Orton et al. 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4], Tee, DiGialleonardo et al. 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). We acquire the MR data using a 42 mm diameter 13C/1H volume transmit coil (Rapid Biomedical, Rimpar, Germany) with a single loop 20 mm diameter 13C receiver coil (Rapid Biomedical ) (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]). Anatomical proton images are acquired using the 1H volume coil acting in transmit and receive mode and the 13C data are acquired using the volume coil in transmit mode and the surface coil in receive mode. Both frequency channels are connected to an active decoupling unit (Rapid Biomedical) for detuning/retuning the coils during the 13C pulse sequence.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/735-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. 13C receive coil with preamplifier interface",
    "Place the animal on the bed, with a pad underneath the chest for respiratory monitoring and a rectal thermometer to monitor body temperature (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/735-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. Positioning the 13C receiver coil over the tumor\nInhalational anesthesia is provided via a nose cone. A 1:2 ratio of air:oxygen at 2 L per minute and containing 1%–2% isoflurane is sufficient to maintain anesthesia.\nVital signs are monitored using a small animal monitoring system (Small Animal Instruments Inc., NY, USA) that records respiration rate and body temperature. Anesthesia can be adjusted to maintain respiratory rate at 40 to 80 breaths/min and body temperature at approximately 37°C. We maintain body temperature by passing warm air over the animal but a water-heated bed can also be used.\nWith the mouse at the magnet isocentre, the volume coil is tuned for both proton and carbon frequencies, the carbon coils are then disconnected from the pre-amplifier to reduce noise for proton imaging.\nThe proton carrier frequency and coil transmit power are determined and manual shimming is used to optimize the water linewidth using a non-localized pulse and acquire sequence.\nA set of anatomical MR Images are then acquired with the following parameters: A localizer image is acquired in three planes (axial, coronal and sagittal) to confirm positioning of the tumor close to the magnet isocenter. Three sets of three spoiled gradient echo images, with an echo time of 3 ms and a repetition time of 30 ms, are acquired with a pulse flip angle of 20°. Each data set consists of 3 slices, 2 mm thick with 2 mm spacing between slices, a field of view of 100 mm × 100 mm acquired into 128 × 128 data points.",
    "A set of axial T2-weighted images are acquired from the abdomen. Fast spin echo images, 15 contiguous slices, each 2 mm thick, are acquired with a 40 mm × 40 mm field-of-view into 256 × 256 data points. An effective echo time of 48 ms is used with a train of 8 echoes and the center of k-space collected at the 4th echo. Fat saturation is also included and the repetition time is 2 s.\nA set of sagittal T2-weighted images are acquired from the full length of the animal. The acquisition parameters are the same as for the axial T2-weighted images but the field-of-view is 80 mm × 40 mm acquired into 512 × 256 data points with 18 slices (to achieve full mouse coverage), a 49 ms effective echo time and a repetition time of 2.05 s.\nThese anatomical images (axial and sagittal) can now be used for planning the slice-selective pulse and acquire acquisition sequence used to shim on this volume.\nSet up a pulse and acquire sequence using a Shinnar-Le Roux excitation pulse and a gradient combination to give excitation of a specified slice, with a thickness between 6 and 10 mm depending on tumor size. The slice can be rotated from an initially coronal plane so that it maximizes coverage of the tumor while minimizing overlap with the surrounding body. Acquiring 1H spectra with this sequence in manual shimming mode allows optimization of the shim to give water linewidths of between 40 and 100 Hz by adjusting the first and second order shims.",
    "Serial hyperpolarized 13C spectra are then acquired from this same volume with a similar pulse sequence. In this publication we describe acquisition of 13C spectra, but 13C spectroscopic images can also be acquired (see (Day, Kettunen et al. 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2])). The 13C channel of the volume coil is reconnected and the active decoupler unit set for 13C acquisition. The carrier frequency is set to a predetermined value close to approximately 179 ppm and the flip angle is preset to a nominal 5°, as previously calibrated on a phantom. This value is not varied between mice, with no adjustment for different coil loading by different animals. The phantom consists of a 5 mm diameter glass tube containing 1.2 mL of a 4 M sodium [1-13C]lactate solution.\nRunning the dissolution process, injecting the hyperpolarized sample and acquiring 13C spectra\nOnce optimal polarization is reached, usually after 30 to 45 min (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]), place a \"sample catcher\" next to the MRI magnet to receive the hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate sample. The catcher has a 3 way tap that can be used to fill a 1 mL syringe (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/735-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10. The solid-state polarization build-up can be viewed in the Hypersense software\nOptimal polarization is reached after 30 to 45 min, and as shown here the polarized sample can be kept for longer until ready to be used.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/735-Fig11.jpg\nFigure 11. Sample catcher used to receive the hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate solution\nPlace 6 mL of dissolution buffer into the Hypersense pressure vessel. Close the tap at the top of the pressure vessel and move the dissolution stick into position.",
    "The sample will be dissolved at 180 °C but will cool rapidly to around 22°C–25°C as it arrives in the sample catcher. Draw the hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate solution into the syringe and push back and withdraw 5 times rapidly to mix the solution (see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1], step 9). Remove the syringe and inject 0.3 mL (final pyruvate concentration in the injected solution is 83 mM) into the mouse by changing the syringe at the end of the cannula with the new syringe containing the hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate sample.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Running the dissolution process, injecting the hyperpolarized sample and acquiring 13C spectra, related to step 9\nStart the MR acquisition at the start of injection (this usually requires a second person). The time between dissolution and injection is usually less than 30 seconds. This is a critical step which needs to be performed rapidly as the polarization of the sample decreases with time after dissolution. An extended delay between dissolution and injection into the mouse will result in poor signal-to-noise in the acquired 13C spectra or images.\nA series of spectra are then acquired from a slice within the tumor every second for three min.\nData are acquired with a nominal flip angle of 5° from a 6–10 mm thick slice, excited with a 600 ms sinc pulse. The spectral width is 6010 Hz with the Free Induction Decays (FID) acquired into 1024 data points, with a delay of 0.93 ms between the end of the pulse and the start of signal acquisition.\nIf post-treatment data acquisition is required the position of the slice selected after treatment needs to be as close as possible to that used for pre-treatment data acquisition (Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12], from (Ros et al. 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6])).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/735-Fig12.jpg",
    "Figure 12. Example of slice selection pre and post-treatment] from (Ros et al. 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6])\nIt is possible to check that the experiment has worked during data acquisition. Go to vnmrJ and select the Current Scan box (right top). Type the command wft (Weighted Fourier transform (FT). Weighting applies a window function to FID to enhance resolution or signal-to-noise and reduce truncation artifacts from finite data collection). The spectra acquired will appear and by using the forward and reverse arrows (right top) you will be able to see these over time. If the experiment has worked a pyruvate peak will appear and the lactate peak will build up later. If no signal is detected see the Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#resource-availability] section.\nRemoving the animal from the magnet and cleaning the system\nWhen data acquisition is complete, remove the mouse from the bed and place it on a heated blanket or plate.\nCarefully remove the cannula from the tail vein.\nPress the hole until it stops bleeding and let the mouse recover from the anesthesia in a heated box.\nMeasure the pH of the injected solution with a pH indicator strip. This should usually be 7.5. If the pH is lower than 4 or higher than 8 the imaging results should be discarded since pH can affect the injection. The pH can be measured prior to injection but the resulting delay inevitably results in further loss of polarization. Since an out-of-range pH is an infrequent occurrence, we usually make retrospective pH measurements.\nTo clean the Hypersense system use a 200 mg/L EDTA solution, as described in the manual.\nAnalysis of the acquired data\nTiming: [∼15 min]\nTiming: [∼10 min] for step 11",
    "Note: The script ‘Matlab_pyrlac_script’ is imported into Matlab where it is used to Fourier transform, with line broadening, the acquired spectra and the spectrum with the maximum pyruvate peak intensity is identified. Each spectrum is then referenced to this spectrum. The spectra are phased automatically by maximising the peak height using a zero order phase correction. The first order phase correction is set to 0.125 radians/ppm in order to compensate for the delay between the pulse and the beginning of signal acquisition.\nUploading the script and calculating the ratio\nUpload the script ‘Matlab_pyrlac_script’ and fid files. The Matlab script integrates the [1-13C]pyruvate and [1-13C]lactate peaks and sums the integrals over the three min of signal acquisition. The ratio of these summed integrals (lactate/pyruvate) is proportional to the rate of lactate labeling (Hill, Orton et al. 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Provided that the pyruvate inflow is captured differences in the time of pyruvate injection and subsequent initiation of signal acquisition have no significant effects on this calculation.\nThe summed spectrum is baseline corrected by fitting a 15th order polynomial to points selected manually as not containing any metabolite signal and subtracting this baseline from the real part of the spectrum. The regions containing the pyruvate and lactate peaks, which are selected manually, are then summed to give the integrated amplitudes of these two resonances. These provide the numerator and denominator in the following equation\n    A r e a  U n d e r  t h e  C u r v e   [  1  − 13  C  ]  L a c t a t e   A r e a  U n d e r  t h e  C u r v e   [  1  − 13  C  ]  P y r u v a t e",
    "This ratio is then used as a metric for the rate of lactate labeling."
