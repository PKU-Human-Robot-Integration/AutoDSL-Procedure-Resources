    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nThis protocol describes in detail the expression and purification of mouse Gal-8 L isoform. Different Galectins and their derivatives that have been successfully purified using this method are listed in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1], and the plasmids are available upon request. Comments and notes highlight differences in the expression and/or purification steps between these Galectins and Gal-8. For any other given Galectin, the provided methodology constitutes a useful base protocol in which additional modifications can be included in order to raise protein yield\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_315_6.csv\nProtein Purification\nTiming: 2 days\nIn this part of the protocol, bacteria cells are lysed, and the Galectin-containing extract is subjected to two sequential steps of protein purification for a high purity yield. The first step consists of a lactose-affinity chromatography, taking advantage of the Galectin’s specific lectin activity. Then, the eluate is subjected to a Ni2+-affinity chromatography taking advantage of the His-tag presence in the recombinant protein. Finally, imidazole is removed from protein preparation by dialysis, and endotoxins are eliminated using a poly-L-lysine resin.\nCell Lysis\nUnfreeze the pellet at 20°C–24°C until it starts to melt. Transfer immediately to ice.\nCritical: Maintain the sample and buffers on ice.\nResuspend the pellet in 30 mL of lysis buffer.\nAdd 100 μg/mL of lysozyme.\nWait until lysis is evident by observing an increased viscosity due to the release of DNA. Albeit sufficient lysis can be observed immediately after pellet resuspension, it usually takes from 15 to 30 min, and occasionally, up to 1 h. Then add 10 μg/mL DNase.\nCritical: A complete lysis is required to obtain a high yield of recombinant protein.",
    "Distribute the sample into two tubes and proceed to sonicate by soaking the sonicator’s small horn/tip into the sample, setting the power at 15 watts. Perform five cycles of 30 s alternating the tubes and maintaining on ice between each sonication cycle.\nAlternatives: In the absence of an ultrasonic cell disruptor, incubation with DNase should be extended. Besides, the addition of Magnesium may be required in order to efficiently disrupt the DNA.\nRemove cell debris by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 45 min at 4°C.\nAlternatives: In the absence of an ultracentrifuge, cell debris can be removed by two consecutive centrifugation cycles at 20,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C.\nFilter the supernatant through a 0.45 μm-pore membrane with a syringe.\nLactose-affinity chromatography\nSeed the soluble filtered extract into a pre-equilibrated 1 mL Lactosyl-Sepharose column.\nWash the column with 20 mL of ice-cold PBS plus 1 mM PMSF.\nElute with 10 mL of ice-cold pyrogen-free PBS plus 1 mM PMSF and 100 mM lactose.\nCritical: Perform steps 2a to 2c by placing the column inside the refrigerator or in a cooled room.\nCollect the elution in 1 mL-fractions.\nRead the absorbance of each fraction at 280 nm using a nano-spectrophotometer to check the presence of the recombinant protein. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]\nAlternatives: If a 280 nm spectrophotometer is not available, a Bradford reaction can be performed to identify the elution peak.\nOptional: Check purity and integrity of Gal-8 in a 10% SDS-PAGE (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Use 15% SDS-PAGE for Gal-1 and 12% SDS-PAGE for Gal-3.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/315-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Lactosyl-Sepharose Purification of Recombinant Mouse Gal-8 Isoform L (Gal-8L)\nAliquots from lactosyl-Sepharose-eluted fractions (1–7) were solved by 10% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue. Fractions 1–4 were pooled for subsequent IMAC purification. M, molecular weight marker.",
    "Pause Point: Eluates can be stored up to 2 days on the refrigerator until IMAC purification.\nMetal-affinity chromatography\nCritical: Keep all buffers and samples on ice. All buffers must be prepared with pyrogen-free water. If glass labware is used, it should be previously decontaminated at 180°C for 3 h.\nPool the protein-containing fractions and dilute 1/5 with IMAC pH 8.8 buffer (Example: 4 mL of the sample plus 16 mL of IMAC pH 8.8 buffer, please see buffer preparation).\nSeed the sample into the pre-equilibrated HisTrap column at a 0.5 mL/min rate.\nWash the column with 15 mL of IMAC pH 8.8 buffer.\nElute the protein with IMAC pH 6.8 buffer, collecting fractions of 1 - 1.5 mL.\nRead the absorbance at 280 nm in a nano-spectrophotometer using an aliquot of each fraction to check for protein presence. Use the elution buffer as blank.\nDialyze during 18–20 h protein-containing fractions at a rate of 1/1000 (at least) in Tris-saline buffer at 4°C and mild agitation.\nAlternatives: Bradford’s reaction can also be used to verify protein-containing fractions.\nAlternatives: Dialysis can be performed in two consecutive steps using less buffer; for example, two 1/250 dilutions.",
    "Note: If biologically active Gal-1 is required, there is a need to prevent the formation of intramolecular disulfide bridges that hampers the correct homodimerization of this lectin, thus leading to gGalectin activity loss (Guardia et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). This can be achieved by a protein alkylation reaction with iodoacetamide. As the dialysis step may not be sufficient to eliminate iodoacetamide traces, it is recommended to perform this reaction between the purification steps. To do this, invert steps 2 and 3 as follows: perform first steps 3b–3e, seeding the extract into the pre-equilibrated IMAC column. Then, incubate the eluted protein for 18–20 h at 4°C in the presence of 0.1 M iodoacetamide. Next, dilute the alkylated lectin with PBS and executed steps 2a–2e. To finish, dialyze the Gal-1-containing fractions and continue with step 4 of the Protocol.\nEndotoxin removal\nSeed 1 mL containing 1–2 mg of the dialyzed Galectin into a 0.5 mL Pierce High-Capacity Endotoxin removal resin.\nCollect the pass-through and seed it again for four consecutive times.\nCollect the final eluted protein.\nMeasure endotoxins with the technique/kit of choice to make sure all endotoxins were removed. We use Endpoint Chromogenic LAL Assay. Endotoxin content is usually less than 0.06 UE/mL. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]\nNote: Poly-L-lysine can be regenerated five times after the first use.\nProtein Preparation\nTiming: 1 day\nRecombinant protein purity and specific activity are checked in this part of the protocol. Also, proper storage conditions to preserve Galectin integrity and function are described here.\nProtein storage\nAdd 10% glycerol (suitable for cell culture) to stabilize the eluted protein and store up to 2 months at 4°C. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]\nFor longer time conservation, add 50% glycerol and store at −20°C. Perform a hemagglutination assay (see step 7) to check the activity before its use.\nProtein analysis",
    "Determine protein concentration by measuring absorbance at 280 nm using a nano-spectrophotometer.\nCheck purity and integrity of Gal-8 in a 10% SDS-PAGE.\nNote: Use 15% SDS-PAGE for Gal-1 and 12% SDS-PAGE for Gal-3.\nProtein activity: hemagglutination assay (see scheme in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/315-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Step-by-Step Scheme of the Hemagglutination Assay\nRBC, red blood cells. PBS-BSA: 1× PBS plus 1% BSA.\nAdd 1 mL of PBS to 100 μl of freshly obtained citrate-anticoagulated mouse blood and centrifuge at 3,500 rpm for 15 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and mix the pellet (40 μL approximately) with 960 μl of PBS plus 1% BSA (PBS-BSA) thus obtaining a 4% v/v suspension of fresh mouse red blood cells (RBC).\nMake two-fold serial dilutions of Gal-8 in PBS-BSA on a 96 well round-bottom plate, starting with 144 to 1.125 μg/mL on a final volume of 50 μL. Use one well with PBS-BSA without Gal-8 as a hemagglutination negative control.\nCarefully add 50 μL of RBC suspension to each well without mixing to avoid bubble formation (just shake the plate by hand slightly at the end). Then, incubate the plate on a straight surface for 1 h at 20°C–24°C without moving. Gal-8 activity is visualized by the presence of a homogenous RBC mesh covering the well vs. an RBC button."
