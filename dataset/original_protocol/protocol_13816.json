    "Northwestern University’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved the procedures of this study. All participants enrolled in this work gave informed consent prior to beginning the protocol detailed below.\nNOTE: The specific ultrasound system used in this study had EFOV-US capabilities and was adopted because we were able to review details about and validity assessments for the algorithm in the scientific literature22,26; multiple other systems with EFOV-US also exist18,20,30. A linear array transducer 14L5 (frequency bandwidth 5-14 MHz) was utilized. The muscles imaged in this protocol are just a small subset of muscles for which US images have been captured and fascicle lengths measured (e.g., triceps25, extensor carpi ulnaris23, medial gastrocnemius10, vastus lateralis24, biceps femoris8,31). This protocol is intended to provide pointers and describe the necessary standards so that that it may be applied to muscles beyond the two examples we provide.\n1. Collecting EFOV-US images of muscles\nPreparation\nSonographer Preparation\n\t\nPrior to operating the ultrasound system, read through the system’s manual to become familiar with system safety, care for maintaining the system, system setup and controls, etc. In addition, review the system’s instructions for obtaining EFOV-US images and be familiar with the method implemented to obtain the EFOV-US images.",
    "NOTE: Different ultrasound systems name the EFOV-US mode using different terminology. For example, in the system used here, the EFOV mode is referred to as “Panoramic Imaging”. While the technical details of the algorithm implemented in various commercial systems are usually intellectual property and therefore not freely available, from a cursory review, many commercial systems with panoramic ultrasound capabilities describe an approach similar to the one described by Weng et al.22. Evaluating the general validity of measurements acquired from any system, either by obtaining more detailed information directly from the company who manufactures the system, by using an imaging phantom26,32, or by other means (e.g., comparison to animal dissection24) is recommended as an important step before initiating research involving human participants.\nTake time to become familiar with the anatomy of the muscle(s) of interest as well as the surrounding anatomy. It is suggested that the sonographer use an anatomy textbook or preferably an interactive online 3D anatomy model to become familiar with the anatomy of interest.\nParticipant Preparation\n\t\nExplain the protocol of the study to the participant and acquire IRB approved consent prior to beginning the imaging protocol.\nAsk the participant to wear appropriate clothing to enable access to the muscle of interest. For example, if the sonographer plans to image a forearm muscle, the participant should be asked to wear a short-sleeved shirt.\nSeat the participant in an adjustable chair that can be locked in place. Take time to adjust the chair to make the participant as comfortable as possible while still providing access to the muscle of interest.\n\t\tNOTE: If an adjustable chair which can lay completely flat is not available, some study designs may require the use of a table to access the muscle of interest (i.e., hamstrings).",
    "Place the joint(s) that the muscle of interest spans in a posture that can be controlled and repeated. Use clinical guidance33 for locating anatomical landmarks and implementing goniometry; use ISB standards for defining the joint coordinate system34,35. In general, to measure joint angle, mark anatomical landmarks with skin safe marker (Table of Materials) and then align the center of a handheld goniometer up with the axis of rotation of the joint and the arms of the goniometer up with the joint segments.\n\t\tNOTE: If imaging passive muscle, placing the muscle of interest in a relatively lengthened position is recommended to avoid imaging slack muscle.\n\t\t\nTo replicate the biceps brachii as imaged in this study, seat participants with feet supported, back straight, shoulder at 85° of abduction and 10° of horizontal flexion, elbow at 25° flexion, and forearm, wrist, and fingers at neutral.\nTo replicate the tibialis anterior as imaged in this study, seat participants with knee at 60° of flexion and the ankle at 15° of plantar flexion.\nSecure the participants limb using cloth straps to minimize movement during the imaging protocol.\nImage Acquisition\nPlug in and turn on the ultrasound system. Ensure that the exam is set to Musculoskeletal, the transducer in use is selected (here we used 14L5), and the transmit frequency is set between 5-17 MHz (here 11MHz was used), a typical frequency range for musculoskeletal imaging. Higher frequencies are generally used for more superficial imaging as they improve resolution but decrease wave penetration.\nGo into the system settings to adjust the footswitch settings. For the purposes of this protocol, we recommend setting the footswitch to start/stop the imaging. If the footswitch in use has multiple pedals, set additional pedals to “Freeze” or “Pause”, and “Print” or “Store” the image.",
    "Apply a generous amount of ultrasound gel to the head of the transducer.\nPlace the transducer on the participant’s skin on the approximate region of interest.\nMove the transducer in the short axis plane of the muscle. Note that the transducer has a small protuberance on one side, called an indicator. The side of the transducer that has the indicator corresponds with the left side of the ultrasound image. When imaging in the short axis, have the sonographer keep the indicator pointed laterally and when the sonographer is in long axis, point the indicator distally.\nIdentify the muscle of interest in the short axis plane (perpendicular to muscle fiber direction) and move the transducer distal and proximal to get a full visualization of the muscle path.\n\t\nMark important anatomical landmarks (i.e., the lateral and medial edges of the muscle, the muscle tendon junction, and muscle insertion) using skin safe ink markers (Table of Materials).\nOnce the location of the muscle has been identified and properly marked, have the sonographer move the ultrasound transducer in the long axis plane (parallel to the muscle fiber direction).\nBeginning at either the distal or proximal end of the muscle, rotate and tilt the transducer to identify the fascicle plane at that point. Make a mark on the skin when the correct transducer position has been established.\nOnce the approximate fascicle plane has been established along the entire desired length to be scanned, have the sonographer practice following this path.\nTo begin collecting images, put the ultrasound system in EFOV-US mode.\nStarting at one end of the muscle, click the footswitch to start image acquisition and slowly and continuously move the ultrasound transducer in the long axis. Once the end of the muscle has been reached, click the footswitch to end image acquisition.",
    "Practice and ensure the correct transducer path. This may take several practice images before consistently obtaining “quality” EFOV-US images (See section 2 for explanation of quality images).\nTo optimize image visibility and clarity, consider adjustments to the following parameters.\n\t\nDepth: If image acquisition ends before the desired length of the muscle can be captured, increase the depth of the image (in the system used here, increasing image depth increases the absolute length the scan can be).\nFocus: Place the focus arrow in the lower half of the Image just below the muscle of interest.\nGain: Ensure the gain is balanced through the depth of the image.\nSpeed: Image at the optimum speed as guided by the indicator (in most systems a speed indicator displays on the monitor during panoramic imaging).\nOnce qualitatively good images have been collected (step 2.1), hit the Print/Store footswitch pedal or a synonymous button on the control panel to save the image.\nRepeat steps 1.13-1.16 until 3 quality EFOV-US images of the muscle are obtained.\nRepeat steps 1.6-1.17 until all muscles of interest are obtained.\nUse a towel to gently wipe the gel from the participant’s skin. Then have the participant rinse off the area of the skin or use a damp towel to wipe the skin that was exposed to the gel. Dry.\nWipe gel from the head of the transducer and disinfect.\nExport images as uncompressed DICOM images onto a CD-DVD, flash drive, or through the local network onto a computer.\n2. Determining “quality” of the EFOV-US image",
    "Following step 1.13, have the sonographer identify and evaluate the quality of key anatomical features of the muscle of interest and its surrounding anatomy. This is a qualitative assessment based on the sonographer’s knowledge of anatomy and musculoskeletal tissue echogenicity (ability of a tissue to reflect ultrasonic waves). For an EFOV-US images to be considered qualitatively “good” the following should be met:\n\t\nIn any long-axis image of a muscle, check that the sonographer can clearly identify the muscle as a hypoechoic (dark) shape with hyperechoic (bright) boundaries which represent the deep and superficial muscle fascia.\nBetween the muscle boundaries, check that the sonographer can identify the connective tissue surrounding a muscles fascicle as hyperechoic (bright) lines.\n\t\tNOTE: When imaging multi-pennated muscles, the image should also contain central tendon(s) that show up in the muscle belly, between the deep and superficial muscle fascia, as a hyperechoic (bright) structure.\nCheck that the image does not have excessive bending. This is usually indicated by shadows or gaps in the image or a jagged flexible ruler line over the image.\nIf the image is missing one or more of the tissue structures described in 2.1, deem the image “qualitatively poor” and return to live 2D-mode.\n3. Quanitfying Muscle Fascicle Length\nTo quantify muscle fascicle length, use ImageJ, an open source image processing platform. ImageJ can be downloaded at https://imagej.net/Downloads.\n\tNOTE: Though ImageJ is frequently implemented24,25,31,36,37,38, quantification of muscle fascicle length may be measured using other image processing software8,39 or custom codes40,41.\nOnce downloaded, open the ultrasound images as DICOM images in ImageJ by clicking File | Open and selecting the image to analyze.",
    "To ensure that the DICOM image properties have been preserved, click on the Straight Line tool in the Tools menu and draw a straight line from 0 to 1 cm on the ruler on the side of the ultrasound image. Then go to Analyze | Measure to measure the line made. If the image properties have been preserved, the length of the straight line should be 1 cm.\nTo measure fascicle lengths in the image, complete the following.\n\t\nRight click on the Straight Line tool.\nSelect Segmented Line.\nMove the cursor onto the image and click at one end of the fascicle that has been chosen to be measured.\n\t\tNOTE: Only make measurements on fascicles that the entire fascicle path (i.e., from one aponeurosis to the next aponeurosis or aponeurosis to central tendon) can convincingly be seen.\nClick along the path to ensure curvature in the fascicle path is captured.\nOnce the end of the fascicle path is reached, double click to end the line and go to Analyze | Measure to measure the length of the line.\n\t\tNOTE: A new window, “Results”, will pop up the first time a measurement is made. What values are displayed can be managed in the Results window by going to Results | Set Measurements.\nRepeat steps 3.4.3-3.4.5 until multiple fascicle measures are made in a single image.\nSave fascicle measurements by clicking File | Save on the results tab or the values can be copy and pasted into another document/spreadsheet.\nSubscription Required.
