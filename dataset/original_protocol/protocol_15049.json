    "All procedures are performed with approval from the University of Newcastle Animal Care and Ethics Committee, as well as in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations, including the NSW Animal Research Act, the NSW Animal Research Regulation, and the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes.\n1. Dissection of Brain Tissue\nSacrifice twelve week old male rats by decapitation. Rats can either be sacrificed by stunning and decapitation, or can be first anesthetized with isoflurane (5% induction, 1.5-2% maintenance) in 70% N2 and 30% O2, and then decapitated.\nRemove the brain from the skull as rapidly as possible (ideally, this should be performed in less than 2 min).\nRemove the cortex by free-hand dissection. The dissection should be performed in the minimum time possible, with as little damage to the brain as possible so as to maintain the integrity of the slices.\nIn order to remove any residual skin, fur, blood, etc., immerse the brain in a small amount (3-5 ml) of 37 °C Krebs buffer (118 mM sodium chloride, 4.7 mM potassium chloride, 1.3 mM calcium chloride, 1.2 mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 1.2 mM magnesium sulfate, 25 mM sodium hydrogen carbonate, 11.7 mM glucose, 0.03 mM disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), equilibrated with 95% oxygen/5% carbon dioxide (carbogen), pH 7.4).\n2. Preparation of Microslices\nPlace the brain on the stage of a McIlwain chopper on which two slices of filter paper have been placed and moistened with warm Krebs buffer. Keep the brain and filter paper moistened with warm Krebs buffer, but not so wet that there is free liquid on the surface of the paper that can cause the brain to slide around.",
    "Slice the brain into 250 µm coronal sections. As nutrients, oxygen, and waste materials that are normally exchanged with the blood supply are exchanged with a fluid which surrounds the tissue in isolated neural tissue, the size of the slices should not be more than 400 µm in thickness to allow adequate oxygenation and nutrient exchange to occur.\nTurn the McIlwain stage 90°.\nSlice brains into 250 µm sagittal slices. Herein, these brain sections (250 µm x 250 µm slices of variable length depending on the thickness of the tissue) are referred to as microslices.\nPlace the microslices into a round bottom tube with 10-15 ml 37 °C Krebs buffer (the amount of Krebs buffer used will depend on the amount of tissue).\n3. Equilibration of Microslices\nGently agitate until individual microslices are suspended, and then allow them to settle under gravity.\nCarefully remove the supernatant, which will be cloudy due to suspended cell debris, and add 10 ml fresh 37 °C Krebs buffer to the tube.\nRepeat this washing procedure four times, which will result in the removal of the majority of debris.\nFollowing this, equilibrate the microslices at 37 °C with gentle shaking/inversion, and change the Krebs buffer every 15 min for 1 hr in total.\nAt this time, add 2 ml fresh 37 °C Krebs buffer, and transfer 15-20 microslices (150 µl of microslice suspension) to flat bottom polystyrene 5 ml tubes using an extra wide bore pipette tip with smoothed edges (which can be created by cutting ~2 mm from the end of a P1000 tip). Spread the microslices evenly over the base of the tube in a single layer, so that each microslice is not further than a few millimeters from the oxygenated atmosphere.\n4. Excitotoxic Stimulation",
    "Incubate the microslices at 37 °C, and continually pass carbogen over the surface of the 150 µl microslice suspension, using a gas line that is positioned just above the surface of the microslice suspension (to avoid mechanical disruption).\nTreat microslices with either 150 µl 5 mM glutamate + 100 µM glycine in Krebs buffer (excitotoxic stimulus: final concentration 2.5 mM glutamate + 50 µM glycine) or 150 µl Krebs buffer alone (control nonstimulated). A variety of stimuli can be used at this step (including, but not limited to, AMPA, NMDA + glycine, KCl depolarization, and oxygen/glucose deprivation).\nRemove the incubation solution at various times post-stimulation (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 300 sec), and replace it with 300 µl of ice-cold homogenization buffer (30 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, 4 mM EDTA, 100 µM ammonium molybdate, 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride, complete protease inhibitor cocktail).\nHomogenize microslices on ice, using a glass-Teflon Dounce Homogenizer (20 strokes; 700 rpm).\nStore homogenates at -80 °C, and various signaling molecules, death molecules, etc. can be measured by western blot.\nSubscription Required.
