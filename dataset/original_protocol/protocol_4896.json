    "Maintain cells in McCoy’s 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a cell culture plate until cells are 70-80% confluent. Wash cells once with PBS and trypsinize cells by adding 1 ml trypsin solution and incubate for 3-5 min until cells are floating under microscopy. Add 5-10 ml growth medium, mix them with a pipette, and count cells with a hemocytometer.Seed cells on chamber slides with appropriate seeding density. The number of cells for a confluent chamber slide will vary with cell type. For this experiment, we use HCT-116 with a seeding density of 2 x 104 cells/well in a 4-chamber slide.Allow to rest for 24 h or treat the cells as required for 24-72 h in an incubator 37 °C 5% CO2.Prepare formaldehyde solution with 1 ml 37% formaldehyde in 9 ml 1x PBS, giving a final concentration of formaldehyde of 3.7%. This solution should be prepared immediately before use. Note: Formaldehyde is toxic. Please read the MSDS before working with this chemical. Gloves and safety glasses should be worn and solutions made inside a fume hood.Next day, or after treatment, wash cells twice with ice-cold PBS and fix them with 200-300 µl 3.7% formaldehyde solution for 10 min on ice.Afterwards, wash the cells twice with PBS for 5 min each at RT (room temperature).Permeabilize cells by covering cells with permeabilization solution for 10 min at RT.Wash cells twice with PBS. Optional: subsequently, proceed to block cells with blocking reagent and stain cells with antibodies.Afterwards, remove supernatant and stain cells with either DAPI, PI, Hoechst 33342 or DRAQ5 with a final concentration of 1 µg/ml for 15-30 min, respectively in the dark at RT.",
    "Notes:Blue spectral properties make it ideal for use with green (Alexa Fluor® 488, FITC, GFP) and red (Alexa Fluor® 594, rhodamine, Texas Red®, mCherry, mKate-2) fluorophores in multicolor experiments. For live-cell staining, Hoechst® 33342 dye is a popular cell-permeant nuclear counterstain.Optional: Use vectashield mounting medium including 0.5 µg/ml DAPI (Vector Laboratories, USA) the nuclear staining step is not required. Proceed with step 15.Rinse with PBS and carefully remove the chambers from slides.Allow the slides to dry for 2-3 min.Mount coverslip with a drop of mounting medium.Seal coverslip with nail polish to prevent drying and movement under microscope.Use a Zeiss LSM (Laser Scanning Microscope) 700 META microscopy laser system, and a ZEN 2010 microscopy system equipped with a 63x and/or 100x objective.Allow the microscope and lasers to warm up for 15-20 min before use.The setting used for stain depends on nuclear staining:DAPI (Laserline: 405) excitation/emission 350/470 (nm);Propidium iodide excitation/emission 535/617 (nm);Hoechst 33342 excitation/emission 350/461 (nm);DRAQ5 excitation/emission 647/681 (nm).First use 63x magnification objective to find nuclei and capture a minimum of 500 nuclei. For better resolution of anaphase bridges a 100x objective could be used.For statistical analyses count cell nuclei in a) mitosis (M), b) anaphases (A), and c) anaphases with bridges (AB) separately (Figures 1a and 1b).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161012/20161012183825_7886.jpgFigure 1. Fluorescence determination of tumor cells with anaphase-bridges. a. Cells in mitosis (M) and specific anaphase with anaphase-bridge (AB) are shown. Scale bar = 10 µm. b. A clear difference could be identified by enlargement of these nuclei in specific cell cycle phase. Representative images of cell nuclei in different cell cycle phase are shown. A. Interphase, B. Prometaphase, C. Metaphase, D. Anaphase, and E. Anaphase with bridge. Scale bars = 5 µm. All cells were stained with DAPI staining. The 'bridge' of anaphase bridges is marked (white arrow)."
