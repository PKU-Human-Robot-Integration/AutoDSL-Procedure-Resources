    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPlating cells\nTiming: 20 min\nFollowing experimental design, cells should be grown and collected to be plated into 96 well, optical bottom, black-walled plates. The number of plates needed is dictated by the number of conditions to be tested; however, an additional T0 control plate must also be plated. Care should be taken in accurately counting and seeding cells. This will reduce noise in the fluorescence measurements and provide consistent data between replicates. Two technical replicates are performed on the same plate to account for plating bias. Additionally, biological replicates should also be performed on separate plates or experiments performed on subsequent days.\nCell line of interest should be cultured according to established protocols.\nNote: This protocol is suitable for cells with any growth morphologies or characteristics. Very small cells or cells that grow with uneven density (clumpy or in colonies) will generate noisier data, particularly at low cell densities. This may compromise the low end sensitivity of the assay.\nCount cells using a hemocytometer or automatic cell counter.\nDilute cells to the appropriate concentration in cell culture media that allows for the proper seeding density. Cells should be seeded at a starting density at which untreated cells do not become confluent during the assay, taking into account the doubling time, well size, and length of the experiment. Following counting, cells should be resuspended at a concentration that allows for plating at 90 μL/well.\nResuspend cells by gently pipetting up and down, then add 90 μL of cell suspension to plates.\nSee step 14 in Before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] and Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] for optimal experimental designs, including number of technical and/or biological replicates per experiment.\nPlace in incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2 to adhere overnight (4–18 h).",
    "Pause point: The assay can begin immediately after the cells have adhered to the plate. Most commonly, drugs are added the following morning after plating, but the assay could also start anytime within the following 2–3 days while the wells are not confluent and the cells are growing normally. Whatever decision is made should be consistent across all plates in a given experiment.\nAdding SYTOX and compound\nTiming: 1 h\nSYTOX green solutions with and without compound are prepared and added to experimental wells. A 1% Triton-X solution is prepared and added to the T0 control plate to determine initial total cell fluorescence.\nPrepare a 1% Triton-X permeabilization buffer in sterile PBS.\nApproximately 1 mL is required to permeabilize an entire 96-well plate. Extra should be made to account for dead volume, particularly if dispensed from a reservoir using a multi-channel pipette.\nPrepare a 10× SYTOX solution (see Before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] step 11) by diluting 5 mM SYTOX in enough volume of culture media for your experimental design. The total volume should be enough for all dilutions, experimental wells, and T0 control plate.\nDilute the compounds of interest to 10× the final desired concentration in 10× SYTOX solution. This should also be done for a vehicle control. If doing dose-response experiments, it is recommended to create 10× drug dilutions in round-bottom plates by serial dilution.\nNote: Round-bottom plates are recommended to reduce the dead volume during pipetting\nAdd 10 μL of the SYTOX+compound (or vehicle) solution to appropriate wells. Add 10 μL of 10× SYTOX only solution to the T0 control plate. The final volume of the well should now be 100 μL with 1× SYTOX and 1× compound (or vehicle).",
    "Add 10 μL of 1% Triton-X permeabilization buffer to all wells of the T0 plate and place in the incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2 for >2 h (or the length of time optimized in Before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin], step 8).\nFluorescence measurements\nTiming: 1–3 days\nThis step quantifies the raw fluorescence of dead cells at chosen time points. After the final measurement is taken, cells are lysed using Triton-X buffer to quantify the total cell fluorescence at the end of the assay.\nSet the fluorescence plate reader to the appropriate excitation, emission, and gain settings for the chosen SYTOX concentration.\nTake an initial reading for the experimental plates. Once the measurement is finished, keep the plate stored in the incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2 until the next time point.\nOnce the T0 control plate is fully permeabilized (step 10), measure the fluorescence. This measurement of Total Starting Fluorescence will be used later in Quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis], step 2. Discard the plate when finished.\nContinue taking measurements at selected time points until the end of the experiment.\nCommon assay lengths are generally 48–72 h after drug addition, but these depend on the growth rate of cells being tested.\nTime points should be ∼ 4 h apart, at a roughly constant interval, and selected to capture multiple (2–3) time points within the increasing phase of the response and the plateau phase of the response. Selected time points should be the same across biological replicates.",
    "Note: Both the frequency and the interval of measurements will affect the accuracy of the kinetic fitting (Quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis], step 3). In particular, the inference of death onset time (DO) depends on capturing changes in cell death within both the increasing phase and plateau phase of the response. See Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] for more details. Plates should remain in the incubator between time point measurements unless the plate reader used is equipped with a temperature and CO2 controlled environmental chamber. Temperature fluctuations caused by frequent removal from the incubator may compromise cell health and/or growth rate.\nPrior to reading the final time point, prepare fresh 1% Triton-X permeabilization buffer. Prepare enough volume to lyse all experimental wells.\nAfter the final measurement, add 10 μL of 1% permeabilization buffer to each well. Lyse the plate for > 2 h at 37°C and 5% CO2\nOnce all wells have been fully lysed, take a final fluorescence measurement. This final measurement is proportional to the total cell count at the end of the assay.\nCritical: Before taking the total cell count measurement, check the plate for complete lysis under a microscope.
