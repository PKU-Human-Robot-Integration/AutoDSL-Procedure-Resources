    "1. Preparation of hESC-qualified Basement Membrane Matrix-coated Plates\nSlowly thaw the hESC-qualified basement membrane matrix (see Table of Materials) solution at 4 °C for at least 2–3 h or overnight to avoid formation of a gel.\nTo prepare basement membrane matrix-coated plates, dilute matrix in cold DMEM/F12 to a 2% final concentration. Mix well and coat each well of a 6 well plate with 1 mL of the diluted matrix solution.\nIncubate the basement membrane matrix-coated plates at room temperature (RT) for at least 3 h or at 4 °C overnight.\n\tNOTE: Plates with basement membrane matrix can be stored at 4 °C for 1 week before the matrix solution is removed and plates are used.\n2. Adaptation of Colony type hESCs to Single-cell hESC Culture\nTo passage the feeder-free cultures of colony type H9 (WA09) hESCs grown on basement membrane matrix, aspirate the medium from the wells (Figure 1A)9.\nWash 1x with 1 mL of DPBS. Add 1 mL of dispase solution (1 U/mL) per well and incubate at 37 °C for 20 min.\nRemove the dispase, wash the cells 1x gently with 2 mL of DMEM/F12, remove the medium, and add 2 mL of DMEM/F12 to each plate.\nGently detach colonies by gently pipetting up and down and transfer to a 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the pellets for 2 min at 370 x g and aspirate the medium.\nTo dissociate the cell pellets into single cells, add 2 mL of cell detachment solution (1x concentration, see Table of Materials) and incubate at 37 °C for 10 min.\nCentrifuge cells for 2 min at 370 x g and remove the detachment solution.\nAdd fresh mTeSR1 human ESC medium and dissociate the cells into single cells by gentle pipetting up and down.",
    "To adapt colony type hESCs to a single-cell type culture, plate approximately 1.5–2.0 x 106 hESCs into each well of the basement membrane matrix-coated 6 well plate in 2 mL of mTeSR1 containing 10 μM ROCK inhibitor for 24 h (Figure 1A).\nAfter 24 h, replace the hESC medium with fresh mTeSR1 without ROCK inhibitor and allow the hESCs to grow as a single-cell type for 3 days. Change the medium daily.\nOn day 4, when cultures reach nearly 100% confluency, dissociate cells in detachment solution, then replate as described in step 2.6.\n\tNOTE: The ROCK inhibitor improves cell survival during the initial 24 h of single-cell type hESC culture.\n3. Embryoid Body Formation and Differentiation into Three Germ Layers (Figure 2)\nTo form EBs, first resuspend cells in 3 mL of mTeSR1 medium with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor during the first 24 h, then incubate overnight into 60 mm low attachment dishes in a 37 °C incubator to allow aggregation.\nAfter 24 h, the small EBs are transferred to a 15 mL tube. Let the EBs settle to the bottom of the tube and gently remove the medium with a pipette. Transfer EBs into EB medium (knockout-DMEM supplemented with 20% knockout serum replacement, 1x glutamine supplement [see Table of Materials], 1% NEAA [non-essential amino acids; see Table of Materials], and 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol) and allow them to expand in low attachment dishes for 7 days. The medium can be changed every other day as described above (Figure 2A).\nOn day 7, collect the EBs from the dishes and transfer them into a 15 mL tube. Gently remove the medium with a pipette and transfer the EBs to a basement membrane matrix-coated 6 well plate.",
    "Allow the EBs to attach to the plate and incubate for 12 days in EB medium, during which they will differentiate into the three germ layers (Figure 2B). Change the medium every other day.\n\tNOTE: During aggregation of cells, the low attachment dish helps avoid EB attachment.\n4. Differentiation of Single-cell Type hESCs Into NPCs (Figure 3)\nTo induce NPC differentiation, dissociate single-cell type hESCs with 1 mL of detachment solution (1x) and incubate for 10 min at 37 °C.\nCentrifuge the cells for 2 min at 370 x g and remove the detachment solution supernatant. Add 1 mL of DMEM/F12 and resuspend cells by gentle pipetting.\nPlate cells on a basement membrane matrix-coated 6 well plate at a density of 2 x 105 cells/well in 2 mL of mTeSR1 containing 10 μM ROCK inhibitor.\nAfter 24 h, replace the culture medium with neural induction medium (DMEM with 1% B27 minus vitamin A) supplemented with 1 μM dorsomorphin and 5 μM SB431542.\nChange the medium every other day during the first 4 days of neural induction, then every day until reaching confluence at day 7 (Figure 3B).\n\tNOTE: (1) Dorsomorphin inhibits the BMP pathway by targeting ALK2,3,6 receptors and also inhibits AMPK; SB431542 is an inhibitor of the TGFβ/Activin pathway by targeting ALK5,7. (2) The same protocol was tested with another ESC line (WA01), which yielded similar results as WA0916. (3) We have generally used Matrigel for the basement membrane matrix; however, cells can be cultured on Geltrex and then differentiated into NPCs with very similar results as indicated by the expression of several NPC markers (Figure 4D,E). Handle Geltrex in the same manner as Matrigel (see section 1).\n5. NPC Expansion and Cryopreservation",
    "After 7 days of neural induction, dissociate cells with 1 mL of detachment solution (1x) and incubate for 10 min at 37 °C.\nCentrifuge the cells for 2 min at 370 x g and remove the detachment solution supernatant. Add 1 mL of NPC expansion medium (see Table of Materials) and resuspend cells by gentle pipetting.\nPlate 1 x 105 cells in 2 mL of NPC expansion medium on basement membrane matrix-coated 6 well plates.\nPassage NPCs multiple times, as necessary, when cultures reach nearly 90% confluency. During the first 3–4 passages, add 10 μM ROCK inhibitor during the initial 24 h to prevent cell death. After these passages, cells can be passaged and cultured without ROCK inhibitor. Change the medium every other day during the expansion.\nCryopreserve NPCs when cultures reach confluency.\n\t\nFor cryopreservation, dissociate cells in 1 mL of detachment solution (1x) for 5 min at 37 °C, then centrifuge suspension for 2 min at 370 x g to remove the detachment solution.\nAdd cell freezing solution (see Table of Materials) to dissociated NPCs at 1 x 106 cells/mL and distribute 1 mL aliquots to cryovials.\nPlace the cryovials into freezing container and store them overnight in a -80 °C freezer.\nStore the cryovials in the liquid nitrogen.\n6. Preparation of poly-L-ornithine (PLO) and Laminin Coated Plates\nTo prepare PLO/laminin coated plates, dilute the PLO stock solution into PBS or water to a final concentration of 10 μg/mL. Mix well and coat each well of a 6 well plate with 1 mL of diluted PLO solution.\nIncubate for at least 2 h at 37 °C or overnight at 4 °C.\nWash each well with PBS.",
    "Dilute laminin stock solution in cold PBS or water at 10 μg/mL. Mix the laminin solution well. Remove the PBS and immediately coat each well with 1 mL of the laminin solution. Keep plates at 4 °C and use within 1 week. Wash with PBS and immediately add culture medium.\n\tNOTE: Do not let the PLO/laminin coated plates dry out.\n7. Differentiation of hESC-derived NPCs Into Dopaminergic Neurons (Figure 6A)\nPlate NPCs in PLO/laminin-coated dishes in NPC expansion medium at a density of approximately 50%.\nAfter 24 h, change the medium to DA1 medium (neurobasal medium containing 2 mM glutamine supplement, 1x NEAA, 1x B27, 200 ng/mL SHH, and 100 ng/mL FGF8) and change the medium every other day.\nPassage cultures when they reach confluency. Dissociate cells with 1 mL of detachment solution (1x) and incubate for 10 min at 37 °C.\nCentrifuge the cells for 2 min at 370 x g and remove the detachment solution supernatant. Add 1 mL of DA1 medium and resuspend the cells by gentle pipetting.\nPlate 1 x 105 cells in 2 mL of DA1 medium on PLO/laminin-coated 6 well plates.\nAfter 10 days, change to DA2 medium (neurobasal medium containing 2 mM glutamine supplement, 1x NEAA, 1x B27, 200 μM ascorbic acid, 20 ng/mL BDNF, and 20 ng/mL GNDF) and change medium every other day for an additional 20 days (Figure 6A).\n\tNOTE: Add fresh ascorbic acid daily to the DA2 medium. Within the first 14 days, the differentiated cells should be passed when they reach 90% confluency, but no longer after that.\n8. Differentiation of ESC-derived NPCs into Astrocytes\nPlate neural progenitor cells on PLO/laminin-coated plates in NPC expansion medium at a density of approximately 50%.",
    "After 24 h, change the medium to astrocyte medium (DMEM/F12 medium including 1:100 N2, 1:100 B27, 200 ng/mL IGF, 10 ng/mL activin A, 10 ng/mL heregulin β-1, and 8 ng/mL bFGF) and change the medium every other day.\nPassage cultures when they reach confluency. Dissociate cells with 1 mL of detachment solution (1x) and incubate for 10 min at 37 °C.\nCentrifuge the cells for 2 min at 370 x g and remove the detachment solution supernatant. Add 1 mL of astrocyte medium and resuspend the cells by gentle pipetting.\nPlate 1 x 105 cells in 2 mL of astrocyte medium on PLO/laminin-coated 6 well dishes.\nAllow differentiation to continue for a total of 5–6 weeks (Figure 6B).\n9. Immunofluorescence Staining\nCulture cells in 35 mm μ-dishes as described above for each cell type. Aspirate the medium and add 1 mL of 4% PFA solution per dish and incubate for 20 min at RT.\nWash 2x for 5 min with PBS.\n\tNOTE: Once the cells are fixed, the assay plates can be sealed with parafilm and stored at 4 °C. Stain with an antibody within 1 week after fixation.\nAdd 300 μL of blocking solution (goat or donkey serum in PBS) per dish and incubate at RT for 30–60 min.\nWash the dish 2x with PBS for 5 min.\nAdd 300 μL of primary antibody (Table 1) solution (diluted in blocking solution) and incubate at RT for 1.5 h or overnight at 4 °C.\nWash 2x with PBS for 10 min.\nAdd 300 μL of fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibody (Table 1) in blocking solution and incubate in the dark for 1 h at RT.\nWash the cells 2x for 10 min with PBS.",
    "Add Hoechst staining solution (1 μM final concentration in PBS) to stain nuclei. Incubate the cells in the dark for 5 min at RT.\nWash cells 1x with PBS for 5 min and then add 500 μL of PBS. Keep dishes in the dark, then observe fluorescence with a confocal microscope (Figure 2B, Figure 5C, Figure 6A, and Figure 7B).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
