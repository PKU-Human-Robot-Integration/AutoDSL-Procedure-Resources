    "Mice used in this protocol were euthanized according to NIH guidelines. The Animal Welfare Committee at University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston approved all animal work.\n1. Preparation of cell lysates\nPrepare lysis buffer as described in Table 1. To 10 mL of PBS, add 0.1 g of n-dodecyl β-D-maltoside detergent (DDM) and rotate to dissolve. Add 100 µL of phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 2, ML211 (10 µM), PMSF (10 mM) and protease inhibitor cocktail (1x) and chill the buffer on ice before use.\nTransfer required media containing cells from the incubator into 15 mL or 50 mL conical tubes and spin cells at 350 x g for 5 min and aspirate to get rid of any cell debris.\n\tNOTE: We used 1 x 107 cells for each acyl-RAC reaction to be performed.\nWash the pellet by resuspending it in 5 mL of PBS and spinning at 350 x g for 5 min.\n\tNOTE: Perform step 1.3 quickly to avoid cell lysis due to extended incubation in PBS.\nAdd 600 µL of lysis buffer prepared in step 1.1 to the pellet and lyse it by shaking at 1500 rpm in a thermal shaker for 30 min at 4 °C.\nClear lysates by centrifugation at 20,000 x g at 4 ˚C for 30 min to pellet detergent-insoluble materials. Collect cleared lysate in pre-cooled 1.5 mL microfuge tubes and keep them on ice.\nPerform a Bradford/BCA assay to estimate protein concentration. It is critical to ensure the same amount of protein across different samples prior to performing the experiment. We recommend using at least 500 µg of protein per reaction.",
    "NOTE: In the experiments described, we used cultured (Jurkat) cells and primary splenocytes from mice tissue. The lysis method described above can be adopted to other cell types as well. The average protein concentration obtained for the abovementioned cell types is approximately 500 µg per 1 x 107 cells. Jurkat cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium modified to contain 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 4,500 mg/L glucose, and 1,500 mg/L sodium bicarbonate supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 °C with 5% CO2. We used 1 x 107 Jurkat cells per reaction. Primary splenocytes were isolated from mouse spleen tissue as described26. Briefly, spleen tissue was macerated on ice, followed by lysis of erythrocytes in hypotonic solution and separation from the lymphocytes by centrifugation. We used 1 x 107 primary cells per reaction.\n2. Acyl-RAC: Blocking of free thiol groups\nNOTE: All subsequent steps can be performed at room temperature (RT).\nTransfer lysate into a fresh 1.5 mL microfuge tube and perform chloroform-methanol (CM) precipitation as described below.\n\t\nAdd methanol (MeOH) and chloroform (CHCl3) to the lysate at a final ratio of lysate: MeOH: CHCl3 of 2:2:1 and shake vigorously to create a homogeneous suspension.\nSpin at 10,000 x g for 5 min to form a pellet (“pancake”) at the interphase between aqueous and organic phases.\nTilt the tube and aspirate as much solvent as possible using a needle or a gel loading tip.\nAir dry the protein pellet for a few minutes and gently wash it by adding 600 µL of MeOH and mixing gently to avoid breaking up the pellet\nCarefully remove the remaining MeOH and dry the protein pellet on a benchtop for approximately 5 min.",
    "(Optional) Perform an additional centrifugation step to spin down any broken pellet after the MeOH wash to avoid loss of sample.\n\t\tNOTE: The experiment can be stopped after the CM precipitation step. Once the pellet is obtained, it may be stored in 500 µL of MeOH in -20 °C up to a week.\n\t\t\nDissolve the protein pellet in 200 µL of 2SHB buffer by vortexing at 42 °C/1500 rpm in a thermal shaker until the pellet is dissolved.\n(Optional) Incubate for an additional 5–10 min in a sonicating water bath to dissolve the pellet.\n\t\tNOTE: The length of sonication varies depending on solubility of the material. However, prolonged sonication can cause protein degradation.\nPrepare 0.2% methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS) (v/v) in 2SHB by adding 2 µL of MMTS to 998 µL of 2SHB buffer.\n\tNOTE: Use freshly prepared 0.2% MMTS for each experiment.\nAdd 200 µL of 0.2% MMTS in 2SHB to each tube to a final concentration of 0.1% MMTS. Incubate for 15 min at 42 ˚C with shaking at 1500 rpm in a thermal shaker.\n3. Acyl-RAC: Hydroxylamine (HAM) cleavage and capture of S-acylated proteins\nRepeat 3-4x CM precipitations as described above to remove MMTS. Removal of MMTS can be estimated by the lack of distinct odor of MMTS. After each precipitation, dissolve the pellet in 100 µL of 2SHB buffer by vortexing at 42 ˚C/1500 rpm in a thermal shaker until the pellet dissolves, and then dilute with 300 µL of Buffer A.\nAfter final precipitation, dissolve samples in 200 µL of 2SHB buffer as described above and dilute with 240 µL of Buffer A.\nIn case of comparing changes in S-acylation in response to several treatment conditions, measure protein concentration again and proceed with equal amount of protein for each condition.",
    "Retain 40 µL from each sample as an input control.\nSplit samples into two equal parts of 200 µL and mark tubes as “+ HAM” and “- HAM”. Add 50 µL of freshly prepared neutral 2 M HAM (pH 7.0-7.5) to a final concentration of 400 mM to one of the tubes (+ HAM) and 50 µL of neutral 2 M NaCl to the second tube (- HAM), which will be used as a negative control. Proceed to addition of thiopropyl-Sepharose (TS) beads.\n\tNOTE: The experiment can be stopped after any of the CM precipitation steps. Once the pellet is obtained, it may be stored in 500 µL of MeOH in -20 °C up to a week. Neutral pH of 2 M HAM ensures its selectivity for the acyl-cysteine thioester bond and should be carefully adjusted. Care should be taken when handling samples in 2SHB buffer to avoid loss of sample due to excessive foaming. All following steps are identical for - HAM and + HAM samples.\nAdd 30 µL of TS bead-slurry to each tube and rotate the tubes for 1-2 h at RT.\nWash the TS beads 4x with 1% SDS in Buffer A to remove residual HAM.\n\t\nGently spin down all bead samples using a microfuge for 1 min and carefully aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the beads in 500 µL of 1% SDS in Buffer A.\nRepeat step 3.7.1–3.7.2 thrice.",
    "NOTE: Activated thiopropyl-Sepharose (TS) is supplied freeze-dried in the presence of additives that must be washed away at neutral pH before coupling. Distilled water is recommended for swelling and washing. Weigh 0.1 g of beads and resuspend in 1 mL of distilled water and allow it to swell while rotating for 30 min-1 h at RT. Wash beads 1x with buffer A and prepare a slurry with buffer A, in a ratio of 50% settled medium to 50% buffer. Swollen TS may be stored at neutral pH in the presence of 20% ethanol at 4 °C up to a week. Do not use sodium azide as a bacteriostatic agent since azide ions react with the 2-pyridyl disulfide groups. For higher efficiency, prepare fresh beads. While handling the beads, the tip of a P200 pipette tip can be cut slightly so as to prevent any damage.\n\t\tNOTE: The experiment can be stopped at any stage after CM precipitation. The pellet may be store in 500 µL of MeOH in -20 °C up to a week.\n4. Elution and detection of S-acylated proteins\nAfter the last wash, gently spin down the beads as described above and aspirate as much supernatant as possible without disturbing the beads.\nRecover the proteins from beads with 4x SDS sample buffer with DTT.\n\t\nAdd 50 µL of 4x SDS sample buffer to the beads and incubate at 80 ˚C, 1500 rpm for 15 min in a thermal shaker. Let the tubes cool.\nCentrifuge the beads at 5,000 x g for 3 min to completely pellet the beads and transfer the eluted proteins to a fresh 1.5 mL tube using a gel loading tip.\nRun SDS-PAGE and analyze S-acylation of the protein(s) of interest by western blotting.\nSubscription Required.
