    "The experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Ethics and Use Committee of Kunming Medical University (kmmu20220945). Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats of both sexes, 300-350 g, were used for the present study.\n1. Inducing the SAH model\nAnesthetize the rats using 2% isoflurane and 100% oxygen. Maintain anesthesia by supplying continuous inhalation anesthesia with isoflurane (1%-3%). Secure the rat's head using a stereotaxic apparatus (see Table of Materials).\nCreate the SAH model following the steps below.\n\t\nInsert a microinjection needle into the suprasellar cistern. Then, inject autologous blood from the rat's tail artery (without anticoagulant) into the suprasellar cistern using a syringe pump (see Table of Materials).\nImplant a microinjection needle into the right lateral cerebral ventricle using the mentioned coordinates: bregma, −0.8 mm; lateral, 1.4 mm; depth, 4 mm9. For SAH groups, inject 0.2 mL of rat tail artery blood. For sham groups, administer the same volume of isotonic saline (Figure 1A).\n2. Brain slice preparation and stabilization\nDeeply anesthetize the rats using 2% isoflurane inhalation. After decapitation, extract the entire brains and immerse them in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF).\n\tNOTE: Use freshly prepared ACSF solutions with the following composition: 134 mM NaCl, 2.8 mM KCl, 29 mM NaHCO3, 1.1 mM NaH2PO4, 1.5 mM MgSO4, 2.5 mM CaCl2, and 10.11 mM D-Glucose (see Table of Materials). Maintain a pH between 7.3 and 7.4.\nUse a vibratome (see Table of Materials) to prepare acute brain slices with a thickness of 200 µm from the SD rats in ice-cold ACSF that's aerated with 5% CO2 and 95% O2 (Figure 2).",
    "Place the 200 µm-thick acute brain slices in a storage chamber on a nylon mesh submerged in ACSF. Equilibrate the ACSF solution with 95% O2 and 5% CO2, maintaining a temperature range of 35-37 °C. Allow brain slices to stabilize for 2 h, giving them time to adjust (Figure 3).\n3. Labeling pericytes in acute brain slices with TO-PRO-3\nNOTE: Pericytes from acute brain slices were fluorescently labeled using the tracer TO-PRO-310.\nAdd the fluorescent dye TO-PRO-3 to the ACSF, achieving a final concentration of 1 µM. Incubate the acute brain slices at room temperature in a dark environment with the TO-PRO-3-containing ACSF for 20 min.\n\tNOTE: Remember to wear latex gloves while handling TO-PRO-3 for protection.\nTransfer the nylon mesh strainer, carrying the brain slices, from the loading chamber to a 6-well plate rinsing chamber (see Table of Materials). Allow the brain slices to stay in the rinsing chamber for 10 min (Figure 4D).\n\tNOTE: This rinsing step terminates the staining process, decreases background labeling, and prevents nonspecific staining.\nRinse the preparations for a total of 15 min using ACSF solution that's equilibrated with a mixture of 5% CO2 and 95% O2. This rinsing step halts dye uptake and minimizes background labeling (Figure 4C).\n4. Staining non-vital pericytes of cerebral microcirculation in acute brain slices\nIncubate brain slices preloaded with TO-PRO-3 at 37 °C with isolectin B4 conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (FITC-ISOB4; 5 µg/mL, see Table of Materials) for 30 min in a dark environment. After incubation, rinse the brain slices for 15 min in ACSF (Figure 4E).",
    "Incubate the brain slices in ACSF gassed with 5% CO2 and 95% O2 as usual. Add propidium iodide (PI) at a concentration of 37 µM to both solutions at 37 °C. This will label non-vital brain pericytes. Incubate the preparations in this ACSF solution for 60 min in the dark (Figure 4F).\nNext, rinse the preparations for 15 min with ACSF solutions to halt dye uptake and minimize background labeling.\n5. Imaging of vital and non-vital brain pericytes in acute brain slices\nGently transfer brain slices to glass bottom confocal dishes (see Table of Materials) using plastic Pasteur pipettes. Fill the dishes with ACSF solution previously equilibrated with 5% CO2 and 95% O2. Use an iron mesh to secure rat brain slices in place.\nTransfer the glass bottom confocal dishes to the stage of a confocal microscope. Position the acute brain slice at the bottom of the dish and perfuse9 it with ACSF solution equilibrated with a mixture of 95% O2 and 5% CO2 during confocal microscopy imaging (Figure 5A and Figure 5Ab').\nVisualize the wall cells of the cerebral cortical microvasculature using a 40x objective. Capture image stacks using compatible software (see Table of Materials). Use appropriate filters for IB4 (excitation/emission 460 nm/520 nm), PI (excitation/emission 545 nm/595 nm), and TO-PRO-3 (excitation/emission 606 nm/666 nm) (Figure 5D).\n\tNOTE: Capture images with the following details: 40× DIC N1 objective lens, 3 × 12 bit: 512 × 512 pixels (0.22 × 0.22 mm), calibration: 0.42 µm/px.\nIdentify cerebral microvasculature and pericytes based on their network and morphology. Locate a specific region containing a cerebral microvasculature network on each brain slice and capture images.",
    "Carefully note the imaging location to ensure consistency in subsequent captures (Figure 5B,C). For further processing and analysis, use image analysis software (ImageJ) and photo editing software (see Table of Materials).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
