    "Day 1. Preparation of media, reagents, and single coloniesPrepare 100 ml of brain heart infusion (BHI) broth in a 250-ml bottle (for starting overnight cultures), and 1 L of BHI broth in a 2 L Erlenmeyer flask (for large-scale propagation and protein purification) (see Recipe 1).Prepare antibiotics listed in Recipe 1.Prepare all the stock solutions needed for the experiment (see Recipe 2).Streak out a freezer stock of S. epidermidis LM1680 bearing pcrispr/Csm26HN (or S. aureus RN4220 bearing pcrispr/Csm26HN) on a BHI agar plate containing 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol. If S. epidermidis is used, supplement media with 15 μg/ml neomycin (see Note 1).Day 2. Overnight culture preparationTransfer 10 ml of BHI broth into a 50-ml conical tube.Add 10 μl of 10 mg/ml chloramphenicol to select for pcrispr/Csm26HN. If S. epidermidis LM1680 is being used, add additionally 10 μl of 15 mg/ml neomycin. If other strains and plasmids are being used, supplement media with antibiotics as appropriate (see Note 1).With a sterile pipette tip, pick a single colony of S. epidermidis LM1680 bearing pcrispr/Csm26HN (or S. aureus RN4220 bearing pcrispr/Csm26HN).Re-suspend the colony into the 10 ml of autoclaved media containing appropriate antibiotic(s).Close loosely the 50-ml conical tube containing the autoclaved media, antibiotics, and colony of interest.Incubate the bacterial culture at 37 °C for 16-20 h in a shaking incubator set to 180 rpm.Day 3. Large-scale propagation of cells overexpressing the Cas10-Csm complexInto the 1 L of BHI prepared in the 2 L Erlenmeyer flask, add 1 ml of 10 mg/ml chloramphenicol. If S. epidermidis LM1680 is being used, add additionally 1 ml of 15 mg/ml neomycin.Inoculate the 1 L of BHI plus antibiotic(s) with the entire 10 ml of overnight culture prepared on Day 2.Note: The OD600 nm for overnight S. epidermidis and S. aureus cultures is approximately 5-6.",
    "Measure the initial OD600 nm of diluted culture with a cell density meter to facilitate estimation of time required to reach the final OD600 nm (see below).Incubate the bacterial culture at 37 °C in a shaking incubator set to 180 rpm.Let the bacterial culture grow until OD600 nm = 2.00 (approximately 7-9 h if starting with a fresh overnight culture and initial OD600 nm = 0.05).Distribute the 1 L of liquid culture into four 400-ml polypropylene bottles.Centrifuge cells at 5,000 x g, 4 °C for 10 min. Discard supernatant and resuspend each pellet on ice with 10 ml of ice-cold distilled H2O (dH2O).Combine cell suspensions from all pellets into a clean 50 ml conical tube (on ice) and centrifuge at 5,000 x g, at 4 °C for 10 min.Discard supernatant and store pelleted cells in -80 °C (for optimal purification up to a week later) or proceed directly to purification.Day 4. Purification–Part 1Thaw the cell pellet on ice for 1 h.Prepare all buffers described in Recipe 3.Resuspend thawed pellet in 9 ml of ice-cold dH2O.Add 200 µl of 1 M MgCl2 and 125 µl of freshly thawed lysostaphin (2 mg/ml stock).Incubate the cell suspension for 1 h in a 37 °C water bath. Invert the tube several times after 30 min of incubation to homogenize the suspension.Add 10 ml of resuspension buffer to the lysed cells and invert tube several times. The cell lysate will become very viscous (see Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170603/20170603004840_4156.jpgFigure 2. Viscosity of cell lysate before and after sonication of S. epidermidis LM1680 cells expressing pcrispr/Csm26HN. Before sonication (left), the cell lysate is milky white with the consistency of mucus. After sonication (right), the cell lysate becomes tinted brown with a more watery consistency.Important Note: All subsequent steps should be performed on ice or at 4 °C.",
    "Adjust the Sonifier S-450 to power level 6.0 and duty cycle percent to 6.Note: These settings correspond to a 60 W power output with a fixed repetition rate of 1 pulse per second. A duty cycle of ‘6’ indicates that power will be delivered 60% of each 1 sec pulse (with a rest 40% of each second).Pour the lysate into a 30-ml beaker set in an ice bucket. The cell lysate should occupy ~⅔ of the beaker’s volume such that lysate within has at least 1 inch depth.Immerse the sonicator tip into the lysate at a depth of ~½-⅔ inch such that there remains ~½ an inch of clearance from the bottom of the beaker.Important Note: The tip should not touch the sides or bottom of the beaker.Sonicate the lysate on ice for 30 sec at a time with one minute rest period in between. This cycle should be repeated three times or until the lysate has a more watery consistency. Often, the lysate will also acquire a brown tint (see Figure 2).Pour the lysate back into a 50-ml conical tube and centrifuge for 20 min, 4 °C, at 10,000 x g. The clarified lysate after centrifugation often retains the brownish tinge (see Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170603/20170603005056_3392.jpgFigure 3. Appearance of sonicated cell lysate following the first centrifugation. After the cell debris is pelleted, the clarified lysate retains a yellow-brown tinge.Decant the supernatant into a fresh 50-ml conical tube and centrifuge for 20 min, 4 °C, at 13,000 x g.Note: The cell pellet may be saved and checked later on SDS-PAGE for the presence of the Cas10-Csm complex to assess its solubility.",
    "During the two spins, prepare/pack the column (to be done in the cold room or inside a deli refrigerator):Pipet 1 ml of slurry Ni-NTA resin into a disposable gravity flow column and allow the liquid to flow through.Equilibrate the Ni-NTA resin by passing 10 ml of equilibration buffer through the column at 4 °C.Cap the column once most of the buffer has passed through and ~2-3 mm of buffer remains atop the resin.After the final spin (step D12), pass the lysate through a 0.22 µm PES membrane vacuum filter and catch the filtrate into a sterile bottle. Pass the filtered lysate through the packed Ni-NTA column (prepared in step D13) and collect the flow through in a 50-ml conical tube labeled ‘lysate flow-through’. Note: The lysate flow-through can be checked later on SDS-PAGE for the presence of the Cas10-Csm complex in case the complex was suspected to have passed through the column without binding. Wash the column by passing 10 ml of wash 1 buffer through the column.Collect wash 1 flow-through into a 15-ml conical tube.Note: The wash 1 flow-through may be saved and checked later for the Cas10-Csm complex in case the complex was suspected to have passed through the column during the wash.Wash the column a second time by passing 10 ml of wash 2 buffer through the column.Collect wash 2 flow-through into a 15-ml conical tube.Note: The wash 2 flow-through may be saved and checked later for the Cas10-Csm complex in case the complex was suspected to have passed through the column during the wash.Elute proteins from the column with 5-7 aliquots of elution buffer (500 µl for each fraction). As each aliquot flows through, capture it into a fresh, appropriately-labeled microcentrifuge tube.",
    "Into fresh labeled microcentrifuge tubes, combine 20 µl of each fraction with 5 µl of 5x protein loading buffer.Heat samples at 95 °C for 5 min on a heating block. Load samples alongside a protein standard into a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. Run the gel in Tris-glycine-SDS 1x buffer at 120 V for 1 h.Stain the gel with Coomassie Blue solution for 10 min and destain with destaining solution for up to 40 min.Image the gel under white light (Figure 4).Save the desired elutions at -20 °C (see Note 2). Note: Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles of the complex as this leads to protein aggregation. If necessary, aliquot the desired elutions into smaller volumes (~100 µl). Protein complexes that have not been repeatedly thawed can be stored in the elution buffer up to a year at -20 °C without noticeable degradation of protein or crRNAs.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170603/20170603005411_0033.jpgFigure 4. Elutions of the Cas10-Csm complex following purification from S. epidermidis LM1680 expressing pcrispr/Csm26HN. Shown are the seven fractions (E1-E7) collected from a nickel-agarose column and analyzed on a 12% SDS PAGE gel. Proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue G-250.Day 5. Purification–Part 2 Pipette 10 µl of Sera-MagTM magnetic streptavidin coated beads into a microcentrifuge tube.Note: Mix the bead suspension well by pipetting up and down several times before use.Resuspend the beads with 100 µl of 1x annealing buffer (see Recipe 2). Note: Bead re-suspension is achieved once the solution becomes a homogenous brown color and no beads accumulation is seen at the side or bottom of the tube. When tubes are removed from the magnetic rack, the beads within can be easily resuspended. Pellet the beads by placing the microcentrifuge tube into a magnetic separation rack and waiting for the beads to collect on the side of the tube.",
    "Note: The collection process can vary from 30 sec up to 2 min depending on beads and rack used. The collection process will be completed once the supernatant becomes clear and the beads (brown color) aggregate on the side of the tube where the magnet is located. If the beads are broadly spread around the side of the tube, twist the microcentrifuge tube a few degrees clockwise, or counter-clockwise within the rack to pull all beads closer together. Gently pipette out the supernatant without disturbing the beads.Repeat the wash (steps E2-E4) three times.Pool the most concentrated Cas10-Csm complex fractions (obtained in Day 4) and combine with 2 ng of a 5’-biotinylated oligonucleotide antisense to a crRNA (see Note 3).Let the mixture incubate for 30 min at room temperature.Remove the microcentrifuge tube that contains the beads away from the magnetic rack and add the Cas10-Csm complex/oligo mixture into the equilibrated streptavidin beads. Resuspend beads until the mixture appears homogenous and let it anneal at room temperature for 30 min.Collect beads to the side of the tube by placing the microcentrifuge tube back into the magnetic rack ~30 sec.Gently pipette out the supernatant without disturbing the beads.Remove tube from the magnetic rack and resuspend the beads in 100 µl of 1x annealing buffer.Collect beads to the side of the tube by placing the microcentrifuge tube back into the magnetic rack ~30 sec.Gently pipette out the supernatant without disturbing the beads.Repeat the wash (steps E12-E14) two more times.Add 20 µl of 1x annealing buffer to the beads and 5 μl of 5x protein loading buffer. Heat the samples for 5 min at 95 °C on a heating block.Place the tube back into the magnetic rack to remove the beads from solution.Load the supernatant alongside a protein standard into a 12% SDS-PAGE gel.",
    "Run the gel in Tris-glycine-SDS 1x buffer at 120 V for 1 h.Stain the gel with Coomassie Blue solution for 10 min and destain with destaining solution for up to 40 min.Image the gel under white light (Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170603/20170603005702_0575.jpgFigure 5.
