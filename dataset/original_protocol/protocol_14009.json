  "procedures": [
    "Animals were housed in the University of Southern Denmark Animal Care Facility as per institutional guidelines. All procedures involving animal subjects have been approved by The Animal Experiments Inspectorate, Ministry of Environment and Food of Denmark.\n1. Pre-surgery irradiation\nNOTE: Pre-surgery irradiation takes place 7 days before surgery.\nInduce anesthesia.\n\t\nPlace the mouse in an induction box and set the vaporizer to 3% isoflurane with an oxygen flow rate of 0.8−1.2 L/min to induce inhalation anesthesia.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, injectable anesthetics can be used but for the short duration of the irradiation inducing inhalation anesthesia was sufficient. For obtaining the results presented in this article, 9-week old female C57BL6 mice were used.\nMake sure the mouse is fully anesthetized by tail or paw pinch test.\nPosition the mouse for irradiation.\n\t\nIf fully sedated, move the mouse from the induction box and place it under the source of radiation in supine position and gently fixate the hind limbs with tape.\n\t\tNOTE: The mouse will remain sedated for the short duration of the radiation.\nPlace a 1.5 mm thick lead pad to ensure that only the area that undergoes surgery (i.e., the circular area with a diameter of 25 mm around the knee) gets irradiated.\nAdminister a dose of 10 Gy radiation at a dose rate of 5.11 Gy/min (100 kVp, 10 mA).\n\tCAUTION: Safety precautions must be taken when working with radiation. During this experiment, all irradiation was performed in a radiation insulated room, and the source of radiation was only turned on when all personnel had left and sealed the room.\nPlace the mouse back in its cage.\n2. Equipment setup\nNOTE: Surgery should be performed in a room dedicated to surgical procedures. The operative surface must be sterile.",
    "Thoroughly clean all operative surfaces with 70% ethanol. Wear hairnet and coveralls. Use sterile surgical instruments and sterile gloves.\nPrepare anesthesia.\n\t\nDraw up 1 mL of fentanyl (0.315 mg/mL), 1 mL of midazolam (5 mg/mL), and 2 mL of sterile water. Use different syringes and needles for the different components.\nMix fentanyl and sterile water by slowly emptying the syringes into a sterile glass tube. When mixed, add midazolam to complete the working solution.\nPrepare analgesia.\n\t\nDraw up 0.2 mL of buprenorphine (0.3 mg/mL) and 2 mL of saline.\nMix the volumes by slowly emptying the syringes into a sterile glass tube to complete the working solution.\nTurn on the microscope and make sure that the lighting is sufficient, and that the microscope is well adjusted for the operator's eyes.\n\tNOTE: All surgical procedures should be performed under an operating microscope. A magnification range from 4x−25x is sufficient.\n3. Preparation\nWeigh the mouse pre-surgery by placing the mouse in an empty container on a cleared scale.\nAdminister anesthetic.\n\t\nDraw up 0.1 mL of anesthetic per 10 g of mouse bodyweight. Inject the anesthetic subcutaneously as a bolus injection.\nLet the mouse rest in a cage with plenty bedding and shelter for approximately 10 min until fully sedated. Examine the anesthetic depth by assessing muscle relaxation and perform paw or tail pinch test.\nWhen fully sedated, shave the hind limb chosen for the procedure using electrical clippers. Make sure to wipe of excess hair.\nTurn on the heating device, such as a heating pad and cover it with a surgical cloth.\nSet the flow of oxygen to 0.8 L/min and connect it with a nosecone. Use 100% oxygen.\n\tNOTE: The nosecone is only for oxygen delivery and not anesthesia.",
    "Apply ophthalmic ointment and inject 0.5 mL of saline subcutaneously, preferably in the scruff of the mouse, to prevent hypovolemia during surgery.\nPosition the mouse for surgery.\n\t\nPlace the mouse on the surgical cloth in supine position. Place the nosecone over the snout.\nFixate the end of the hindlimbs gently with tape to prevent the mouse from shifting during surgery.\nSterilize the skin using alcohol/chlorhexidine or alcohol/povidone iodine.\n4. Surgery\nNOTE: In this example, the left hind limb (when the mouse is viewed in supine position), has been chosen for the procedure.\nMake a circular incision.\n\t\nLift the skin with smooth forceps and clip a small opening approximately 5 mm proximal to the popliteal fossa.\nSlide sharp scissors into the opening and clip towards the knee so that the incision ends just above the knee. Make sure not to puncture the underlying vessels by lifting the skin with forceps while clipping.\nMove the mouse to prone position and continue to clip from the knee towards the popliteal fossa until the circumferential incision is complete.\nDissect the skin below the knee.\n\t\nGently blunt dissect the area below the knee to a couple of millimeters above the ankle, by slowly opening and closing the microscissors while lifting the skin with forceps.\nCarefully snip remaining visible adhesions using microscissors. Use sterile saline regularly to keep the tissue moist during the whole procedure.\nDissect the skin at the proximal rim of the circumferential incision so that it can be retracted with an elastic retractor.\n\tNOTE: The retractor allows the operator a better view of the proximal lymph vessel and prevents the proximal rim from shifting during surgery.",
    "While still in prone position, rotate the hindlimb gently and fixate it with tape, so that the ischiatic vein is visible from the most proximal point of the exposed area to the most distal point.\nInject approximately 0.01 mL of Patent Blue V subcutaneously between the second and third toe using a 0.5 mL syringe with a 30 G needle. Gently press the paw a couple of times to distribute the Patent Blue V. Visualize the lymph vessels and lymph node through the microscope as the Patent Blue V fills the lymph vessels.\n\tNOTE: If the blue color of the lymph vessels fades during the procedure, gently massage the paw to promote uptake, rather than inject more Patent Blue V. Excess use of Patent Blue V may lead to leakage and coloring of the tissue surrounding the lymph vessels which may compromise the procedure.\nLocate the important structures: the popliteal lymph node (PLN), the two lymph vessels distal to the lymph node (DLV1 and DLV2), and the one lymph vessel proximal to the lymph node (PLV).\n\tNOTE: All the lymph vessels can be found adjacent to the ischiatic vein. The proximal lymph vessel is usually found medial to the vein, the two distal lymph vessels are found medial and lateral to the vein. The abbreviations of the structures are used in the accompanying video.\nMagnify to clearly visualize the PLV and ligate it with a 10-0 nylon suture using micro-needle holder and microforceps. Press the paw a couple of times to ensure that no Patent Blue V passes proximal to the suture.\n\tNOTE: Trimming the fat surrounding the lymph vessel may be necessary.",
    "Repeat step 4.7 to ligate the two distal lymph vessels. Press the paw several times to ensure that no Patent Blue V passes proximal to the ligature. If the lymph vessels lie to close to the ischiatic vein, try dissecting even further distally.\n\tNOTE: In this example, it can be seen that one of the lymph vessels bursts due to the ligature hindering the lymph flow. The lymph vessels will often split from the vein further down.\nRemove the popliteal lymph node.\n\t\nLocate the popliteal lymph node and clip a small hole with microscissors to access it and remove it with microforceps and microscissors.\n\t\tNOTE: The lymph node has a smooth pearl-like surface in contrast to the surrounding fat tissue.\nTo test if the removed tissue is a lymph node, place it in a test tube filled with water.\n\t\tNOTE: If the tissue is comprised of fat, the tissue will float. If the tissue is a lymph node, it will sink to the bottom.\nRemove the inguinal fat pad and lymph node.\n\t\nBefore removing the inguinal fat pad, use a bipolar coagulator to cauterize the vessels running through the fat.\nResect the inguinal fat pad using microforceps and microscissors. Gently clip the cauterized vessels running through the fat. Then gently resect the fat tissue in the inguinal area.\n\t\tNOTE: The lymph node located in the fat is rarely colored by Patent Blue V and can be hard to differentiate from the fat. Removing the fat pad in one piece is the best way to ensure the lymph node has been removed.\nRinse the leg thoroughly with sterile saline and confirm through the microscope that any small hairs and particles has been thoroughly removed from the surgical area to avoid wound contamination and infection. Make sure there is no active bleeding.",
    "Suture the skin edges down to the muscle facia with a 6-0 nylon suture using forceps and needle holder, leaving a gap of 2−3 mm to constrain the superficial lymph flow.\n\tNOTE: The accompanying video shows an example of finished sutures.\nAdminister analgesia. Draw up 0.1 mL of analgesia per 30 g of mouse bodyweight. Inject the analgesia subcutaneously as a bolus injection.\nWeigh the mouse for post-surgery for comparison.\nPlace the mouse in a cage in a cabinet heated for recovery.\n5. Postoperative care\nGive the mice individual cages to recover after surgery with water and food ad libitum.\nAdminister a bolus subcutaneous dose of 0.02 mL of buprenorphine 3x daily for 3 days for analgesia.\nMonitor the animal daily for appropriate wound healing, signs of pain and infection. If signs of infection are present, use antibiotic ointment.\n6. Post-surgery irradiation\nThree days after surgery, repeat the procedure for pre-surgery irradiation (steps 1.1−1.4).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
