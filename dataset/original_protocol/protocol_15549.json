    "1. Preparation of medium and plates for neuron seeding (Day 1)\nTo prepare the plates for neuron seeding on Day-1, warm Laminin to room temperature (RT) just before use. Prepare the Laminin solution by diluting the Laminin stock solution (0.1 mg/mL) 1/10 in cold PBS+/+ (with Ca2+ and Mg2+).\n\tNOTE: All reagents are listed in the Table of Materials. The compositions of solutions and buffers are described in Tables 1-4.\nThen, add 25 µL of the Laminin solution to each well of a Poly-D-Lysine (PDL) precoated 384-well plate, and incubate overnight at 4 °C. The coated plates can be stored at 4 °C for up to one week.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here for up to one week. Seal plates using plastic film.\nPrepare Complete Maintenance Media and store at 4 °C for up to one month (Table 1).\n2. Thawing of neurons (Day 0)\nTo thaw the neurons on Day 0, prewarm a water bath to 37 °C, and equilibrate the Complete Maintenance Media to RT, protected from light.\nTake the vial containing the commercially obtained frozen neurons (see Table of Materials) out of the liquid nitrogen tank and place it on dry ice. Then place the vial in the water bath for 2 min. Once the liquid is completely thawed, disinfect the vial with 70% ethanol.\nAspirate the thawed neurons with a P1000 pipette (around 370 µL) and transfer them in a 50 mL centrifuge tube without up-and-down pipetting. Next, rinse the vial with 630 µL of Complete Maintenance Medium, dispense drop by drop (45° angle) in the 50 mL tube. Agitate slowly while dispensing.",
    "NOTE: It is critical to dispense the medium slowly, drop by drop, to avoid osmotic rupture of the cells. A 45° angle and light agitation minimizes high local osmotic pressure during pipetting.\nSimilarly, add 1 mL of Complete Maintenance Medium in the 50 mL centrifuge tube with a P1000 pipette. Then, slowly add 2 mL of Complete Maintenance Medium. Agitate carefully while dispensing.\nCount the cells. Prepare a microtube with 10 µL Trypan Blue and 10 µL cell suspension and add to a counting chamber slide (10 µL). Perform counting using an automated cell counter (see Table of Materials) or manually.\nAfter counting, centrifuge the 50 mL tube containing the neurons at 400 x g for 5 min at RT, and remove the supernatant. Carefully resuspend the pellet using a P1000 pipette and 1 mL of Complete Maintenance Medium. Then add the necessary volume to reach the desired concentration (300,000 cells/mL, see also next step).\n3. Seeding of neurons on prepared plates (Day 0)\nTo seed neurons on the prepared plates on Day 0, take the coated plates out of the refrigerator, place them under the cell culture hood and let them equilibrate to RT for about 30 min.\nJust before seeding, aspirate 15 µL coating solution with an automated liquid handler or a 16-channel pipette. Leave approximately 10 µL per well to prevent damage to the coating.\nNext, dispense 50 µL of the cell solution containing 300,000 cells/mL (prepared in step 2.6) per well with a 16-channel pipette, resulting in 15,000 seeded neurons per well and a final volume per well of 60 µL.",
    "In a 384-well plate, avoid using columns 1, 2, 23, 24, and rows A, B, O, and P to minimize possible edge effects which can impact the phenotypic profiles. Fill the unused empty wells with 80 µL of PBS. Incubate the plates at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n4. Medium change or compound treatment (Day 3)\nDepending on the number wells, pre-warm an appropriate volume of Complete Maintenance Medium at RT. Protect from light.\nIf a medium change is required, proceed to step 4.4. If compound treatment is desired, verify the compound stock concentration and the used solvent (water, DMSO, methanol, etc.).\nPrepare a 1.5x concentrated compound solution for all desired concentrations to be tested. Prepare the compound dilutions using Complete Maintenance Medium.\n\tNOTE: As a neutral control, use the respective solvent at the same concentration as the tested compound. If multiple or unknown compounds at different concentrations are used, it is advisable to perform a separate dose-response experiment to measure solvent effects on the phenotypic profile.\nIf an automatic pipetting system is used, add 60 µL of the 1.5x compound solution to a 384-well storage plate. Alternatively, use a 16-channel pipette. If a medium change is required, add 60 µL of Complete Maintenance Medium instead.\nUsing the automatic pipetting system, aspirate and discard 40 µL of medium per well from the neuron-containing plate to keep 20 µL/well. Then add 40 µL/well of 1.5x compound solution from the 384-well storage plate to each well to obtain the desired final concentration.\n\tNOTE: It is critical not to perform full medium changes but to always leave residual medium in the well to prevent damage to the neuronal carpet or the coating.",
    "In case neuronal culture is performed for more than the 6 days described in this protocol, change the medium every 2-3 days.\n5. Neuron fixation and staining (Days 6 to 7)\nTo fix and stain the neurons on Days 6 and 7, make use of an automated liquid handler for all dispensing and washing steps. Alternatively, use a 16-channel pipette.\nPrepare a 10% Triton X-100 solution by diluting Triton X-100 in 1x PBS. Vortex until the solution is homogeneous. Store at 4 °C.\nTo fix the neurons, dispense 20 µL/well of 16% PFA resulting in a 4% final concentration. Incubate the plate for 30 min at RT, and wash it three times with 1x PBS. Leave 20 µL/well of PBS after the last wash.\n\tCAUTION: PFA is recognized as a hazardous substance known to cause oral, dermal, and respiratory toxicity. It also poses a threat to the eyes and may lead to genetic mutations and cancer. Proper handling of PFA requires the use of suitable personal protective equipment, such as eye and face protection, in addition to ensuring proper ventilation. It is important to prevent the release of PFA into the environment.\nFor permeabilization and blocking, prepare a 2x blocking solution (Table 2).\nAdd 20 µL/well of 2x blocking solution (1x final concentration), incubate for 1 h at RT, and wash once with PBS. Keep 20 µL/well of PBS after washing.\nFor primary antibody (see Table of Materials) staining, prepare a 2x primary staining buffer (Table 3).\nAdd 20 µL/well of 2x primary staining buffer (1x final concentration) and incubate overnight at 4 °C. The next morning on Day 7, wash three times with PBS. Leave 20 µL/well of PBS after washing.\nFor secondary antibody (see Table of Materials) staining, prepare a 2x secondary staining buffer (Table 4).",
    "Add 20 µL/well of 2x secondary staining buffer (1x final concentration), incubate for 2 h at RT away from light, and wash three times with PBS. Leave 100 µL PBS/well after the last wash.\n\t\nAdd aluminum sealing on the plate to minimize evaporation. Alternatively, cover the plate using plastic film and aluminum foil. Proceed to image acquisition, or store the plate at 4 °C.\n\t\t​NOTE: The protocol can be paused here for up to one week. If background fluorescence is observed, consider increasing the blocking time. If the staining is insufficient, try increasing the primary antibody concentration or incubation time.\n6. Imaging of fluorescently stained neurons (Day 7)\nAcquire images of the plated, cultured, and stained neurons on Day 7. Ideally, use an automated confocal fluorescence microscope (see Table of Materials). Alternatively, acquire images manually.\nAcquire the Hoechst, TH, α-synuclein, and MAP2 channels using 405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm, and 647 nm lasers, respectively (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: To generate sufficient amount of detailed data for phenotypic profiling, use a 40x objective and acquire 16 fields/well using Z-stacks consisting of 3 Z-slices separated by 2 µm. In case there are pipetting-related damages in the neuronal carpet, try to avoid imaging these areas.\nDepending on the microscope and camera, adjust the exposure times and excitation intensities for each of the four fluorescent channels separately to obtain an optimal dynamic range of the fluorescent intensities.",
    "​NOTE: Imaging software often provides a histogram to determine the ideal exposure time. If the histogram is shifted too much to the left in the low signal range, then the exposure time is too short or the excitation intensity is too low. If there is a sharp cliff at the maximum signal level on the right, then the signal value is saturated. In this case, reduce the excitation intensity or shorten the exposure time.\nStore images in a loss-free and open format such as .tif.\n7. Image processing (Day 8)\nImage segmentation and phenotypic feature extraction are required for the creation of quantitative phenotypic profiles. Use the PhenoLink software for image segmentation and feature extraction (Table of Materials). Instructions for installing PhenoLink can be found in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/Ksilink/PhenoLink).\n\tNOTE: Image segmentation is used to identify and separate different objects or regions in an image, while phenotypic feature extraction is used to analyze and extract relevant information from those regions. Several alternative software solutions, such as CellProfiler10, ImageJ/FIJI11, Napari12, or the Knime Analytics Platform13 are available to extract quantitative information from multichannel fluorescence images.\nPerform image segmentation on illumination-corrected raw images. Determine the respective fluorescent channel intensity thresholds empirically per plate so that the background signal is minimal, and the desired segmented signal corresponds to the signal in the raw image. Plates processed and stained on the same day typically require comparable channel intensity thresholds for segmentation.\nDefine the nucleus size and intensity to separate living from dead cells. When using 40x images, keep all other default parameters and run the software. One hundred twenty-six quantitative image features will be calculated per well (Supplementary Table 1).",
    "Use the resulting tabular quantitative data to construct phenotypic profiles and compare phenotypic profiles from different cell lines or treatment conditions. Each row corresponds to a biological condition (well) and each column corresponds to a determined phenotypic feature.\n\t​NOTE: We provide an example output file together with the data analysis pipeline to illustrate its use (see Table of Materials). Additionally, Figure 3 shows the composition of a phenotypic profile.\n8.
