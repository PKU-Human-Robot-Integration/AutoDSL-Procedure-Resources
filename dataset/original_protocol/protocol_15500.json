    "1. Fly strain maintenance and larval synchronization\nTo perform these experiments, use fly cultures raised at 25 °C on standard Drosophila food composed of 10% yeast, 8% glucose, 5% wheat flour, 1.1% agar, 0.6% propionic acid, and 1.5% methylparaben.\nTo follow this protocol, use the following lines: w1118 (experimental control background), OK6-GAL4 (driver for motor neurons), repo-GAL4 (driver for all glial cells), CG-GAL4 (driver for fat bodies), UAS-Pyronic (pyruvate sensor), UAS-FLII12Pglu700µδ6 (glucose sensor), UAS-Laconic (lactate sensor), UAS-GCaMP6f (calcium sensor), UAS-AT1.03NL (ATP sensor) and UAS-Chk RNAi GD1829. All the lines expressing sensors or RNAi are in the w1118 genetic background.\nTo obtain synchronized third instar wandering larvae, place 300 flies (3-5 days old, 100 males, 200 virgin females) of the desired genetic cross in the egg-laying chamber, which contains a 60 mm Petri dish covered with 1% agarose in phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS). Place a drop of liquid/creamy yeast (1.5 cm diameter) in the center of the plaque to encourage flies to lay eggs (Figure 1).\nKeep the flies at 25 °C for 3 days replacing the agarose Petri dish with a fresh one and freshly dissolved yeast twice daily.\nAllow the flies to lay eggs for 4 h on the fourth day before changing the Petri dish. Remove this plaque. Then, for 3 h, allow the flies to lay eggs in a new agarose plaque with freshly dissolved yeast. Use these larvae in the experiments.\nAfter 3 h, remove the plaque containing the eggs and place it in a 25 °C incubator for 24 h.",
    "Collect 50 to 100 newly hatched larvae from this plaque (0 h after larval hatching) and place them in a plastic vial containing standard food. To allow the larvae to feed properly, ensure that the food is ground and soft. Use the larvae 96 h after the transfer.\n2. Make the glass coverslips with poly-L-lysine\nPerform this step 1 h before the larval dissection. In a 6-well cell culture plate, place 25 mm glass coverslips (the diameter of the covers to be used depends on the recording chamber available in the microscope).\nPlace a drop (300 µL) of poly-L-lysine in the center of each coverslip for 30 min at room temperature.\nWash each coverslip 3x with distilled water, then 2x with a saline solution devoid of Ca2+ (the same solution used to dissect the larvae, see step 3.2). Install the covers in the recording chamber and fill it with Ca2+-free saline solution.\n\t​NOTE: Although the larval brain can adhere directly to the glass coverslips, the adhesion is weak, and the brain occasionally moves or displaces during the experiment due to the continuous flow of saline solution. The addition of the poly-L-lysine step reduces the risk of movements or even brain loss as a result of the washes.\n3. Dissect the ventral nerve cord (VNC) and fat bodies (FBs)\nGather the wandering third-instar larvae from the desired genetic cross (from step 1.7) and thoroughly wash them 3x with distilled water.\nPlace the larvae in a glass dissection dish well containing 750 µL of nominally zero Ca2+ ice-cold saline solution composed of 128 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 5 mM trehalose, 5 mM HEPES, and 35 mM sucrose (pH = 6.7, measured with a pH meter and adjusted with 1 M NaOH and HCl 37% v/v).",
    "NOTE: Setting the pH to 6.7 is critical because, as previously observed, monocarboxylate transport is highly dependent on the pH of the solution. In addition, 6.7 corresponds to the pH in the hemolymph of a third instar larva17,18.\nPlace the larva under a stereomicroscope and make a transverse cut across the back of the abdomen with a pair of forceps.\nPush the jaw with the forceps while turning the larvae inside out.\nObserve the ventral nerve cord (VNC) next to the jaw. Carefully remove the imaginal discs and remaining brain-caudal tissues.\nSeparate the VNC with the central brain and optic lobes from the rest of the tissue by cutting the nerves. Transfer the VNC, picking it up with forceps from the remaining nerves, and placing it in the recording chamber containing the Ca2+-free recording solution (same solution from step 3.2). The VNCs will immediately adhere to the coverslips.\nTo avoid interference from the remaining nerves, attach them at the bottom of the coverslip using forceps (the nerves will also be fluorescent depending on the driver line used) (Figure 2).\nTo perform experiments in fat bodies (FBs) measuring glucose or monocarboxylate transport in another set of experiments, proceed to isolate the tissues following steps 3.1-3.4. Once the larvae are turned inside out, observe that the FB is a white, bilateral, flat tissue.\nPlace the isolated FBs expressing the FRET sensors (obtained from a genetic cross using the appropriate drivers) in the recording chamber containing the recording solution without Ca2+.\n\tNOTE: The FB is highly hydrophobic (it tends to float on the surface of the solution) and extremely vulnerable to manipulation with forceps, it must be handled with care. Any rough handling of this tissue will result in dead cells later (with a decreased fluorescence of the sensors).",
    "Place the recording chamber containing VNCs/FBs on the microscope stage.\n4. Live cell imaging\nTo acquire images of the tissue expressing sensors, use an upright fluorescence microscope coupled to an emission splitting system and a CCD camera. Turn on the illumination system of the microscope 30 min before starting any experiment.\n\tNOTE: Here we use a Spinning Disk fluorescence microscope equipped with a 20x/0.5 water immersion objective to observe both VNCs and FBs. Figure 2 also shows the use of a 40x/0.8 water immersion objective.\nTo visualize GCaMP6f fluorescence, set the excitation and emission wavelengths at 488 nm and 540 nm, respectively. For Laconic/Pyronic/ATP/glucose sensors, set the excitation wavelength at 440 nm and the emission wavelengths at 488 nm (mTFP, CFP) and 540 nm (Venus, YFP).\nAcquire images of 512 x 512 pixels size every 2 s for GCaMP6f and every 10-30 s for Laconic/Pyronic/ATP/glucose sensors. Determine the optimal exposure to the light source observing the quality of the image obtained. To follow this protocol, ensure that the images are of 300 ms exposure for Laconic and Pyronic sensors and 100-150 ms for the glucose and ATP sensors.\n\tNOTE: The exposure can vary depending on the use of a confocal or normal fluorescence microscope.\nOnce the recording chamber is installed in the stage of the microscope, carefully place the water immersion objective and be sure that the objective remains submerged throughout the experiment. Keep the room temperature at 25 °C.\nConnect the recording chamber to a perfusion system and keep the tissues bathed in the recording solution containing 128 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 4 mM MgCl2, 5 mM trehalose, 5 mM HEPES, and 35 mM sucrose, pH 6.7 (measured with a pH meter and adjusted with NaOH and HCl).",
    "Maintain a constant flow of 3 mL/min of recording solution through the tissue using gravity, coupled to a low flux peristaltic pump to extract the liquid from the chamber while keeping the volume constant. To achieve the required flow, position the solution-containing tubes (50 mL plastic tubes) 25 cm above the microscope stage.\n\tNOTE: This gravity-driven flow is used to prevent tissue movement caused by peristaltic pumps, allowing for more accurate image analysis later on.\nBefore any stimulation, maintain the recording solution flowing for 5-10 min to obtain a stable baseline of fluorescence from the sensors. Change the duration as necessary to obtain this baseline.\nReplace the flowing solution with the stimulation solution for 5 min to stimulate the VNC/FBs (with glucose, pyruvate, or lactate at the concentration described for each experiment dissolved in saline solution; see each figure).\n\tNOTE: The duration of stimulation can be varied according to the needs of the experiment (for example, glucose pulses can be increased to 10 min to reach a plateau in neurons, as previously reported16).\nTo maintain osmolarity in the stimulation solution, rectify the sucrose concentration (a carbohydrate nonmetabolizable by the Drosophila brain) according to the concentration of the monocarboxylate or glucose added.\nChange the solutions using a simple system of valves. Be careful not to move the microscope stage.\nExpose the VNC to 80 µM picrotoxin (PTX, continuously flowing) to stimulate neuronal activity. This procedure increases the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations, making it possible to observe changes in metabolically relevant molecules (e.g., intracellular ATP).\nAt the end of any experiment, thoroughly wash the complete flow system, including the tubes and the recording chamber, for at least 10 min with the saline solution and another 10 min with distilled water to eliminate any trace of the solutions used.",
    "5. Image processing and data analysis\nTo process the images obtained, proceed with the steps shown in Figure 3.\nImport the image (Laconic) to the ImageJ software. The image has two views of the sample: the left one is the mTFP signal and the one on the right is the Venus signal. Select a region that includes the cells to be analyzed and separate these images (mTFP and Venus) in a new window. Ensure that these images contain exactly the same area.\nOpen the registration plugin and correct the small drift of the tissue that is normally observed in the experiment with the function rigid body. Perform this in both images (mTFP and Venus).\nSelect at least 10 regions of interest (ROIs) in the cytosol of the corresponding 10 cells in the mTFP signal (488 nm) and transfer the selections to the Venus (540 nm) image.\nSelect two or three ROIs close to the cells being analyzed but with no discernible signal (always within the VNC or tissue analyzed, see Figure 3). These are the background ROIs.\nWith the ROIs selected in both images, obtain the mean grey value of each signal using the function measure. Transfer the data to a data sheet and subtract the average background value for each signal.\nDetermine the mTFP fluorescence ratio over Venus (for Laconic and Pyronic). This value is computed differently than the other FRET sensors described here (where the ratio is usually YFP/CFP) because when bound to their respective substrates, both Laconic and Pyronic reduce their FRET efficiencies.\nNormalize the data dividing each recorded value by the baseline. In a separate data sheet, calculate the baseline by taking the mean value of the mTFP/Venus ratio during the 2 min preceding the stimulus.",
    "For the glucose and ATP measurements using FRET-based sensors, calculate the YFP/CFP ratio, and normalize the data as described in step 5.8.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
