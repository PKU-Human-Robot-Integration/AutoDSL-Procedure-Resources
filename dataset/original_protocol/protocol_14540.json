  "procedures": [
    "Prior to any human procedure, the institutional review board (IRB) must approve the protocol. The protocol used in this study was approved by the US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command IRB. The protocol is designed to demonstrate the physiological responses of compensation to a progressive reduction in central blood volume similar to that experienced by individuals during ongoing hemorrhage in a controlled and reproducible laboratory setting. The laboratory room temperature is controlled at 23 - 25 ˚C.\n1. Equipment Preparation\nTurn on equipment and devices requiring warm-up and calibration.\n\tNOTE: Equipment and devices include a data acquisition system to record data at 1 Hz; two separate devices that provide noninvasive, continuous measurements of brachial artery blood pressure and arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) using two separate infrared finger photoplethysmography cuff sensors9-11; a capnograph for measurement of end-tidal CO2 and respiratory rate; and a finger pulse oximeter to acquire peripheral pulsatile arterial waveforms for measuring Compensatory Reserve.\nSynchronize all of the instruments with internal clocks by adjusting the time stamp on each instrument to match a laboratory master clock that will be used to mark time during the experiment.\n2. Subject Preparation\nInstruct the subject to avoid caffeine, alcohol, and strenuous exercise 24 h prior to testing, and to avoid eating at least 2 h prior to the protocol in the event that hemodynamic decompensation induces nausea.\nPrior to initiation of the protocol, have the physician perform a medical screening exam to ensure the subject meets minimal health requirements, and ensures the absence of exclusion criteria (nicotine use, hypertension, autonomic dysfunction, or history of syncopal episodes). Since pregnancy is an exclusion criterion for participation, require female participants to take a standard urine pregnancy test on the day of the study.",
    "NOTE: For the safety of the subject, the study physician is certified in advanced life support, and is present during the study. A fully-equipped 'crash cart' is immediately available to support the subject's airway, respiration, and circulation in the event of loss of consciousness or an acute cardiac arrhythmia taking place during the LBNP procedure.\nInform the subject about the procedure, and obtain written consent to participate in the study.\n\tNOTE: Explain to the subject that the goal of the study is to apply LBNP until the onset of cardiovascular decompensation (presyncope). Explain that there are cardiovascular parameters that define this point, and LBNP will be terminated when these cardiovascular parameters are observed. Inform the subject that they may also experience symptoms typically associated with presyncope during the LBNP procedure. Instruct the subject to notify the investigator if these symptoms occur and LBNP will immediately be terminated.\nPlace the neoprene LBNP skirt on the subject. Ensure that the skirt is snug around the waist and torso in order to create an air-tight seal.\nInstruct the subject to lay supine on the bed of the LBNP chamber while straddling a stationary post to secure the torso in place during LBNP. Instruct the subject to relax the lower body during LBNP exposure. Secure the subject into the LBNP chamber by sliding the bed into the chamber and attaching the neoprene skirt to the chamber opening to create an air-tight seal.",
    "NOTE: The LBNP chamber provides the capability of accurately (within 0.1 mmHg) controlling the internal pressure from 0 to -100 mmHg either manually or with a computerized profile. The chamber includes an adjustable saddle to secure the subject's body position. Clear plexiglass windows allow for visualization of the subject's legs. An adjustable aluminum waist board allows for an air-tight seal to be created by a neoprene skirt worn by the subject and the LBNP chamber at the level of the iliac crest (Figure 1).\nPlace electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes on the right and left humoral-clavicular joints, and on the right and left lower ribs (total of 4) in a modified lead II configuration (Figure 1) for continuous measurement of heart rate.\nPosition the subject's arms on the arm rests, adjusted so that the hands are supported at heart level. Using appropriate size finger cuffs, place an infrared finger photoplethysmography device on the left and right middle fingers for continuous noninvasive beat-to-beat measurement of blood pressure.\nAttach the finger cuffs to the pressure monitors. Calibrate the devices and record blood pressure according to the manufacturer instructions.12 Enter subject information (age, sex, height, and weight) to enable the appropriate assumptions for calculation (estimation) of stroke volume, cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance by the Modelflow algorithm if desired.13,14\nPlace the finger pulse oximeter on the right index finger for continuous measurement of compensatory reserve1,12  (Figure 2).\nPlace a nasal cannula on the subject and instruct the subject to breathe through the nose to assure sensitive reflections in inspiration and expiration. Nasal air sampling will allow the subject to talk freely for self-reporting of developing symptoms. Connect the nasal cannula to the capnograph for the continuous measurement of respiration and end tidal CO2.\n3. Performing the LBNP Protocol",
    "Start data recording by clicking the \"Start\" button on the data acquisition system. Record baseline data for 5 min. Initiate the first level of central hypovolemia by turning on the vacuum motor and setting negative pressure to -15 mmHg, and hold this pressure for 5 min. Figure 3 outlines the protocol.\nIncrease the LBNP to -30 mmHg, and hold this pressure for 5 min.\nIncrease the LBNP to -45 mmHg, and hold this pressure for 5 min.\nIncrease the LBNP to -60 mmHg, and hold this pressure for 5 min.\nIncrease the LBNP to -70 mmHg, and hold this pressure for 5 min.\nContinue to increase LBNP levels by -10 mmHg every 5 min until the end of the protocol (5 min at -100 mmHg LBNP) or the point of hemodynamic decompensation. Terminate the LBNP by pressing the pressure release button on the LBNP chamber.\n\tNOTE: Hemodynamic decompensation is identified by a precipitous fall in systolic arterial pressure below 80 mmHg, or the subject reporting presyncopal symptoms such as grey-out (loss of color vision), tunnel vision, sweating, nausea or dizziness (Figure 4).\nContinue recording data on the data acquisition system during 10 min after the cessation of LBNP (postLBNP recovery).\nStop recording data at the end of the 10-min recovery period by clicking the \"Stop\" button on the data acquisition system.\nDetach all instrumentation from the subject and remove the subject from the LBNP chamber. Ask the subject to sit after stepping down from the LBNP platform to ensure they are symptom-free before leaving the laboratory. The study is now complete.\nDownload data files from the acquisition system for extraction of the Compensatory Reserve Index (CRI), Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP), heart rate, and SpO2 values. 1,15,16\nSubscription Required.
