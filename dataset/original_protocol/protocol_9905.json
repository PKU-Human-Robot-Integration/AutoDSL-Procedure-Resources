    "The study protocol was ethically approved by the Hebrew University's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (MD-16-14754-2). The study was conducted during 2017, at Lahav Animal Research Institute and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel.\n1. Environmental enrichment protocol during farrowing and lactation period\nNOTE: In this study, sows were housed in farrowing/lactation pens, under restraint for a limited time, from 3-5 days prior to the expected farrowing date and up to 10 days post-farrowing; thereafter, confinement bars were removed, to allow free movement and interaction between the sow and its piglets (illustrated in Figure 1A). However, the following protocol is also suitable for conventional farrowing crates, in which the sow is restrained throughout the entire lactation period.\nHang the enrichment materials (jute and cotton ropes) in the farrowing pen before the sow is moved into it, in order to allow the sows' nesting-like behavior prior to farrowing.\nFor each farrowing pen/crate, prepare two pieces of jute (20 cm wide, one-meter-long), and two pieces of 100% natural, uncolored cotton ropes (2-3 cm in diameter), approximately one-meter-long each.\nTie the jute and cotton ropes (double overhand knot) to the pen/crates' bars, as illustrated in Figure 1, from its middle, allowing the two free ends of each piece to be hung towards the floor. The height of the jute and cotton ropes knots should be just lower than the sows' shoulder, while its free ends are just above the floor (Figure 1B-C).\nSows are typically interested in the jute and cotton ropes; they often pull and chew it. Therefore, replace or refill materials when dirty or finished.\n\tNOTE: In this study, materials were inspected every 4-5 days, and replaced or refilled when needed.",
    "After piglets are born, hang the jute and cotton ropes so that they are reachable for both the sow and its piglets, in a safe place. Typically, when the materials are reachable for both, piglets imitate their dams from a very early age.\n\tNOTE: As an addition, shredded paper can also be provided as environmental enrichment for the farrowing sows and piglets, on slatted floor. However, the compatibility of the drainage and sewage systems, should be critically examined on the specific farm.\n2. Environmental enrichment protocol for weaners (when straw cannot be provided)\nNOTE: In this study, after weaning, each two litters were grouped into one pen of weaners. Optimally, groups should remain static until slaughter, without mixing or introducing new pen mates into the pen, to avoid hierarchy-related struggles and injuries. Space allowance in the pen was according to European Council Directive 2008/120/EC and the Israeli legislation, with approximately 20 pigs per group, and 0.3 m2 of unobstructed floor area available per pig. For technical reasons, straw could not be provided for weaners, not even in racks. When straw can be provided, use the finishers' protocol from weaning to slaughter, as detailed in protocol section 3.\nFor each pen, prepare one-meter-long pieces of 100% natural, uncolored cotton ropes, 2-3 cm in diameter; at least one piece for every 10 pigs. Tie the cotton ropes to a chain hung from the ceiling or to a hanging pole (to distance it from the wall), as demonstrated in Figure 2B.\n\t\nPosition the ropes preferably at the center of the \"active\" area of the pen, close to the feeder and drinkers, and far from the pens' wall (as marked in Figure 2A) to allow 360˚ access, which is expected to prevent aggressive behavior due to competition.",
    "Hang the ropes at a height which allows the pigs to reach it with their mouths easily. Typically, the knot should be lower than the pigs' shoulder, while the free ends of the ropes should be just above the floor, without touching it (Figure 2).\nReplace or refill ropes when dirty or finished.\n\tNOTE: In this study materials were inspected every 4-5 days, and replaced or refilled when needed.\nIn addition to the cotton ropes, provide chewable silicone sticks or similar chewable devices (Figure 2). The device used (see the Table of Materials) contains four chewable sticks which allows at least four pigs to interact with the device simultaneously. Provide one device for every 10 to 15 pigs.\nHang the chewable device with a chain from the ceiling (included in the kit) to allow the device swinging movement; this increases the activity and challenge to the pigs, and also allows more pigs to participate at once.\n\t\nPosition the device at the center of the active area of the pen, far from the pen's walls to allow 360˚ access, which is expected to prevent aggressive behavior due to competition. The end of the silicone sticks should be at a height of 10 to 20 cm above the floor.\nChange the silicone sticks when finished or if dirty.\n\tNOTE: In this study silicone sticks required to be changed only when moved from the weaners' pens to the finishers' pens.\n3. Environmental enrichment protocol for finishers\nNOTE: When straw can be provided during the whole period, start using this protocol from weaning until slaughter, instead of in the finishers' pens only.",
    "Provide each pen with straw placed in a rack, in a hanged net, or in a tower, as illustrated in Figure 2C. When provided in such devices, only small amounts of the straw are available for the pigs at a time, and most of it is being chewed. Therefore, this enrichment can be used on slatted floors, when straw cannot be provided as bedding.\n\tNOTE: In this study, straw was provided in commercial racks (Figure 2C).\nHang the straw racks at a height which is reachable for all pigs, usually just below the shoulder level. Attach them to the wall with the easiest access for as many pigs as possible, preferably within the \"active area\". Make sure the racks are properly and safely secured to the wall to avoid device breakage and injuries.\nMake sure racks are completely filled with straw at the beginning; an addition small amount of fresh straw can be added every 1-3 days. Alternatively refill when the rack is empty, typically every 7-10 days.\n\tNOTE: Long straw is better than chopped straw to reduce aggressiveness in the group and to meet pigs behavioral needs for rooting and exploring20.\nWhen applicable, consider placing a collecting tray or a mat underneath the rack, when the floor is slatted, to avoid straw from being scattered and blocking the drainage and sewage systems (Figure 2C). Since straw is provided for pigs mainly to fulfill their rooting and exploratory behavior, a mat can allow the presence of some free straw to be explored at the ground level.\nIn addition to the straw, provide chewable devices, as detailed in section 2.",
    "When cotton ropes are used for saliva collection, as detailed in the next section, leave the ropes in the pens after saliva collection, as an additional enrichment. Other cotton ropes can also be provided, as detailed in section 2.\n4. Saliva samples collection for cortisol concentrations analysis\nNOTE: This section provides information how to non-invasively collect saliva for cortisol concentration analysis, as a biomarker for acute stress; however, saliva samples can also be used for analysis of other biomarkers and even for screening of potential pathogens. In addition, hair cortisol should be measured when applicable.\nPlan saliva sampling for the same time of the day, to avoid bias, as cortisol secretion changes along the day due to physiologic circadian rhythm, or due to feeding21. Sampling is typically easier before feeding, preferably before the second feeding of the day.\nUse uncolored, 100% cotton rope (2-3 cm in diameter). One rope is typically needed per 12-15 pigs.\n\tNOTE: In this study, commercial, ready to use kits were used for collection of saliva samples.\nTie the rope close to the center of the pen, far from the pens' wall. Make sure that the cord which is used for hanging (between the cotton rope and the bar) is not reachable for chewing by the pigs, and that the free ends of the cotton ropes do not touch the floor, for hygiene reasons (Figure 3A).\nUnravel the free end of the rope, to increase the available chewable surface (Figure 3B).\nLeave the rope hanging for 15-30 min. Typically, pigs are interested in newly provided ropes and would chew it during this time. Typically, the vast majority of the pigs will approach the rope.",
    "To extract the saliva from the rope, put the free part of the rope into a sterile plastic bag (as illustrated in Figure 3D) and squeeze the rope by applying pressure from the outside of the bag, from top to bottom, until enough liquid (suggested at least 2 mL) accumulates at the bottom of the bag (Figure 3E), and then remove the rope from the bag.\n\tNOTE: In this study a 30 cm x 40 cm bag was included in the kit. If possible, this step should be performed in the pen without cutting the hanging cord. In this way, the saliva extraction is usually easier, and the ropes can be left in the pen as an enrichment. If there is not enough saliva, a wringer can be used (was not required in this study).\nTo transfer the saliva from the bag into a sterile tube, pull the rope out and carefully cut the bottom corner of the bag above a 50 mL sterile plastic tube (although only 400 µL is usually required for each analysis in duplicates, at least 2 ml are recommended for collection; Figure 3F). Seal the tube, and mark it with a permanent marker or a pre-prepared sticker (animals/pen, date, time, farm, etc.).\nStore saliva samples in an insulated container with ice packs until delivered to the lab.\nIn the lab, centrifuge saliva samples until dirt can be separated (for 8 min at 3000 x g). The clean saliva should be transferred with a clean disposable Pasteur pipette into pre-marked sterile tubes of smaller volume (e.g., 2 mL screw cap freezer tubes) for convenience. Samples can be analyzed immediately, or can be kept frozen at a temperature of -20 °C or below until analysis.",
    "Prior to cortisol concentration analysis, the relevant samples identity should be confirmed, and samples should be thawed at room temperature if frozen. Gently mix each sample, and then centrifuge it again before the analysis to remove possible leftover dirt that may interfere with the assay (8 min at 3000 x g).\nPerform cortisol concentrations analysis with a validated assay, according to the specific kit protocol.\n\tNOTE: In this study, saliva cortisol samples were measured in duplicates by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer guidelines. For pigs that were previously provided with ropes as enrichments, collecting saliva would be very easy as pigs show high interest in the ropes. However, for pigs that are unfamiliar with the ropes, it might take time for training; thus, collecting adequate saliva may not be possible from the first time. If needed, ropes can be soaked in apple juice for training (obviously, in such case, saliva cannot be used for analysis). If saliva samples are needed from individually housed pigs, the collection may be more challenging than from a group, and training sessions with apple juice-soaked ropes are typically required. Chewing of collection ropes may also be encouraged by sampling individuals one next to each other due to mimicking.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
