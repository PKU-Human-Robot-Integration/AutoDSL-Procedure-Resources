    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nBrain slicing\nTiming: 15 min\nTiming: 30 s (for step 3)\nTiming: 40 s (for step 4)\nTiming: 6 min (for step 5)\nRecently, dentate gyrus granule cells (DGGCs) were discovered to target adjacent DGGCs3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3],4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] via longitudinal axons that span across the dorsoventral (or septotemporal) axis of the hippocampus.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6],7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7],8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] Unlike transverse axons along the DG-CA3 network, these DG-DG axons are involved in anxiety-like behavior.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nSteps 1–7 detail the steps for obtaining acute longitudinal dentate gyrus slices in order to measure the extracellular excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) and examine the synaptic transmission and plasticity of longitudinal DG-DG synapses.\nAnaesthetize a 3–4-week-old mouse by isoflurane inhalation in a closed chamber inside a fume hood.\nWhen its breathing slows to around one beat per sec, decapacitate with scissors at the cervicothoracic junction to remove the spinal cord from the base of the skull.\nIsolate the whole brain with dissection tools, being careful not to touch the hippocampus.\nCut the skin from the base of the skull toward the nose using standard scissors. Peel and cut away the skin on the top and sides to completely expose the skull.\nMake lateral cuts on both sides of the vertebrae and cut through the jaw bones.\nInsert one blade of the microscissors under the skull and cut towards the eyes along the midline. At the bregma line, make two lateral cuts on the skull from the midline towards the eyes.\nUse forceps to open the skull from the incision and expose the whole brain.\nCritical: Avoid applying pressure onto the brain while removing the skull.",
    "Insert the thin, flat end of the spatula near the olfactory bulb and scoop up the brain from the ventral side. Gently cut the optic and cranial nerves with the spatula to free the brain from the skull.\nGently submerge the brain into the 50 mL beaker containing the slicing medium for 20 s on ice. This hardens the tissue, which facilitates slicing.\nDissect out the hippocampus and transfer it to the vibratome.\nTransfer the brain onto the cold petri dish. Use a stainless-steel spoon to transfer the brain, ensuring that only the rostroventral side of the brain comes in contact with the spoon.\nCut out the cerebellum using a scalpel.\nSeparate the left and right hemispheres with a clean top-down cut using a scalpel (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nInsert the blunt end of one spatula into the gap between the cerebral cortex/hippocampus and the midbrain (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D). Use this to hold down the tissue but avoid pressing the spatula onto the cerebral cortex/hippocampus.\nUse the other spatula to cut away the midbrain, thalamus, and septum. This will expose the ‘pocket’ where the hippocampus is located.\nGently isolate the hippocampus from the cerebral cortex using small, scraping motions with the blunt end (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nCut out the septal (medial) and temporal ends (lateral) of the hippocampus using a scalpel (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nNote: Cut the septal and temporal ends at different angles to help you recognize the orientation at later steps.\nSpread a thin, even layer of superglue on the masking tape. Use just enough glue to cover the size of the block of the hippocampus (approx. 3 × 3 mm).\nTransfer the hippocampus onto the curved side of the spatula using a fine brush. Touch the brush on a piece of tissue paper to wick away any excess solution from the brain.",
    "To produce longitudinal slices, stick the CA3 (rostral) side on the glue (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G and 2H). This will orient the tissue so that the blade cuts parallel to the dorsoventral/septotemporal plane.\nSubmerge the disc inside the buffer tray.\nNote: Orient the disc so that the tissue is sliced from the septal to the temporal end (or vice versa) rather than from CA1 to DG (or vice versa) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I).\nProduce hippocampal slices using the vibratome.\nSet the thickness to 300 μm (whole-cell patch recording) or 400 μm (extracellular field recording).\n0.05 mm/s speed and 1.20 mm amplitude are recommended.\nCut away the top 500–600 μm of tissue (depending on the age of the animal), and slice until the CA1 and DG are visible. When visualized under light, the CA1 is clearly visible with bare eyes.\nNote: The best longitudinal slices will contain one layer of CA1 and two layers of DG when observed under a light microscope (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]J). One block of the hippocampus may produce 2–3 slices.\nUsing a blunted disposable pipette, gently but quickly transfer the slices into the inner chamber of the oxygenated holding chamber containing ACSF or slicing medium (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]J).\nCritical: Always keep the slices submerged. Prevent the inner chamber from floating up. Remove any air bubbles from the inner chamber using a pipette, but avoid touching the slices.\nNote: The middle part of the chamber provides the best oxygenation for slices.\nRecover slices\nTiming: 60 min\nLet the brain slices rest inside the holding chamber, which is to be continuously oxygenated.\nFor whole-cell patch recording, place the entire holding chamber inside a 32°C water bath for 30 min, then transfer it to room temperature to rest for an additional 30 min minimum.",
    "For extracellular field recording, rest the brain slices inside the holding chamber at room temperature for at least 1 h.\nSet up electrophysiology equipment\nTiming: 5 min\nTurn on the electronic equipment and computer software. The following should be set up on a vibration-free table.\nFor both whole-cell patch recording and extracellular field recording:\nMolecular Devices Axon CNS MultiClamp 700B Microelectrode Amplifier.\nAxon™ Digidata 1550B Data Acquisition System.\nMolecular Devices Clampex software.\nDual-arm micromanipulator.\nPerfusion pumps.\nPerfusion temperature controller.\nFor whole-cell patch recording only:\nUltima In Vitro Multiphoton Microscope System.\nBruker Galvanometer Driver.\nPrairie Technologies Galvanometer Control.\nBruker Prairie View software.\nFor extracellular field recording only:\nMASTER-9 Pulse Stimulator.\nISO-Flex Stimulus Isolator.\nWhole-cell patch clamp\nTiming: 1 h\nSteps 9–32 help achieve whole-cell patch recording of DG granule neurons (DGGCs) in longitudinal DG slices. Subsequently, focal glutamate uncaging on the dendrites of neighboring DGGCs will elicit excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in the patched cells (steps 33–55). EPSPs will be recorded from patched DGGCs.\nNote: DGGCs in slices may survive for up to 5 h after dissection.\nThaw an aliquot of internal solution on ice.\nConfigure the following:\nOn one arm of the micromanipulator, mount the Current Clamp and Voltage Clamp Headstage. Then attach the silver chloride recording electrode/pipette holder (do not fit the glass micropipette yet).\nAdjust the angle of the Current Clamp and Voltage Clamp Headstage to 15° from the horizontal plane.\nAttach 1 mm diameter tubing (approx. 50 cm long) to the suction port of the pipette holder. At the other end of the tubing, attach a 1 mL syringe connected via a three-way valve.\nInsert a silver chloride reference electrode into the bath solution without touching the brain slice. Then ground the reference electrode.\nAdd picrotoxin to the ACSF perfusion solution (final concentration at 50 μM).",
    "Perfuse the specimen stage with oxygenated ACSF maintained at 31°C–32°C by an automatic temperature controller, supplied and discharged at a steady rate (1.5 mL/min) using peristaltic pumps.\nCritical: Check frequently to make sure that the stage does not flood and that there are no excessive vibrations or fluid currents.\nGently transfer one brain slice to the specimen stage with a blunted disposable pipette. Place a harp on top of the slice to secure its position.\nNote: For glutamate uncaging, the laser path should not intersect with the pipette. Mind the orientation of the slice on the specimen stage so that the laser path can reach the molecular layer of the DG blade, but it does not contact the pipette and its path during whole-cell patch recording.\nAcclimatize the slice on the specimen stage for an additional 30 min.\nVisualize one slice with a 10× air objective under bright-field illumination. Check that the fluid level is stable and that there are no vibrations that could interfere with the patch process.\nSwitch to a 40× water immersion objective. Locate the dorsal blade (the DG layer closer to CA1).\nNote: DG granule cells can be identified by the densely packed arrangement of their soma into rows, which appear darker in color under bright-field illumination (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nSwitch to a water immersion 40× objective and find a healthy cell to patch. Mark the position of the cell with masking tape on the computer monitor.\nNote: Healthy cells have oval-shaped soma. Unhealthy cells have shrunken, misshapen, or circular-shaped (swollen) soma with visible nuclear membranes and nucleolus. Unhealthy cells may also have a dark ‘shadow’ around the soma.\nAdd Alexa Fluor 594 to the K-based internal solution (20–50 μM) and backfill the pulled glass micropipette with the mixed solution.",
    "Aspirate internal solution into a 1 mL syringe.\nAttach a 0.2 μm membrane filter to the syringe.\nAttach a 70 mm blunt tip microcannula to the filter.\nGently tap the patch pipette to remove any air bubbles from the tip.\nAttach the filled micropipette onto the pipette holder, making sure that the silver chloride wire touches the solution.\nSet to voltage-clamp mode [VC] on [MultiClamp 700B commander]. Load the [Membrane Test] function on [Clampex] software and set it to [Bath] mode.\nApply constant positive pressure inside the pipette by injecting a small amount of air with the 1 mL syringe (approximately 0.2 mL).\nCarefully position the patch pipette into the bath solution between the objective and the brain slice.\nLift the objective until it just remains in contact with the bath solution (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). Do not adjust the X and Y-axis positions of the stage, so you know where to approach the pipette.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2335-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Schematic diagram of how to approach a target neuron with a patch pipette\n(A) The water immersion 40× objective is raised up while maintaining contact with the bath solution.\n(B) The patch pipette is positioned under the objective so that the shank becomes visible.\n(C) The tip of the pipette is found under the microscope.\n(D) The patch pipette and objective are lowered simultaneously until the pipette tip is just above the target neuron.\nWith a fine control mode of the micromanipulator, position the patch pipette just below the lens until it becomes visible as a shadow under the microscope (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nCritical: Keep the pipette tip clean by not touching it with anything but the brain slice.\nAs soon as the pipette touches the bath solution, click [Auto] under [Pipette Offset] on [MultiClamp 700B] software.",
    "Check the tip resistance. The Rt in [Clampex] [Membrane Test], as well as the Resistance in [MultiClamp], should be the same.\nFor DGGCs, target the tip resistance to be 5–7 MΩ for whole-cell patch recording and 3–4 MΩ for extracellular field recording.\nCheck the waveform of the membrane current and remove any electrical noise (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] – problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]) by monitoring the [Scope] window (10–20 kHz sampling rate).\nMove the patch pipette until the tip becomes clearly visible under the microscope (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nCheck that the tip is not broken and that there are no debris or air bubbles inside.\nLower the pipette towards the slice while maintaining the tip in focus (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D). Use a finer control mode on the micromanipulator and the fine adjustment knob of the microscope.\nOnce the target neuron and pipette tip are visible at almost the same Z-axis position, focus on the target neuron and slowly approach the pipette towards the cell.\nWhen they come into contact, the positive pressure inside the pipette should produce a slight dent on the cell surface. The current pulse shown on the [Membrane Test] should also start to decrease.\nCell attachment – Immediately apply gentle suction by pulling out the syringe plunger or via mouth pipetting. The cell is successfully attached when the tip resistance reaches at least 1–5 GΩ.\nNote: Holding the membrane potential at -81 mV in [MultiClamp], which is the typical resting membrane potential of DGGCs, helps to counteract membrane hyperexcitability that may occur immediately after breaking into a patched cell. The seal should form within around 1 min.\nClick Cp Fast: [Auto] in [MultiClamp] to correct for fast capacitance.\nBreak-in – Apply more potent suction to rupture the cell membrane.",
    "Optional: Use the [Zap] function in [MultiClamp] to deliver a pulse that may help with membrane rupture.\n1 min later, switch to current-clamp mode [IC] and measure the resting membrane potential (mV).\nConfiguration of two-photon laser microscope\nTiming: 15 min\nConfigure a two-photon laser microscope (e.g., Bruker Ultima In Vitro two-photon microscope) equipped with two lasers (e.g., Coherent Chameleon Ultra Ti: Sapphire), each of which is tuned to an excitation wavelength of 810 nm (for image acquisition) or 720 nm (for glutamate poststimulation) and modulated by an electro-optic modulator (or Pockel cell, Conotopics, M350).\nNote: It may take approx. 10 min for the laser to warm up after turning on the power.\nNote: The microscope is set up so that the epi-fluorescent and trans-fluorescent signals are captured through a 60×, 1.0 N.A. objective and a 1.4 N.A. oil-immersion condenser (Olympus). The fluorescence is split into red and green channels using dichroic mirrors and band-pass filters (ET545/30× and ET620/60 m, dichroic T570LP; ET470/40× and ET525/50 m dichroic T495LPXR). Red fluorescence (Alexa Fluor 594) signals are captured using R9110 photomultiplier tubes. Prairie View 5.4 software (Bruker) is used for image acquisition and photostimulation.\nTwo-photon imaging of a patched neuron and its neurites\nTiming: 45 min\nSteps 34–43 allow high-resolution visualization of a single DG neuron that was patched in steps 9–32.\nExternal light sources should be minimized in a darkened room, including any halogen light sources.\nSwitch to a 60× objective lens.\nOn [Clampex], run a pre-configured protocol to inject the threshold current (pA) once every 10 s for 5 min.\nThe threshold current is determined as the lowest current level required to induce a single action potential.\nConstant threshold current (pA) is applied for 100 ms.",
    "Note: This process helps to monitor neuronal viability and promotes the fluorescence dye to spread to distal dendrites for clear visualization.\nIn the main window of [Prairie View 5.4] software:\nStart with 256 × 256 in [Image Resolution] field.\nActivate [Ch1 (Channel 1)] button in [Image Window].\nClick on [Live Scan] in [Scanning] field.\nIn [Power/Gain] tab, increase the power of the [Imaging] laser by clicking the right arrowhead.\nCritical: Increase the power one by one to prevent photodamaging the brain slice with the high laser intensity.\nIn [Power/Gain] tab, adjust the PMT intensity until an appropriate amount of brightness is visible in [Image Window].\nDefine a region of interest around the cell body of the patched neuron and its neurites.\nSet [Image resolution] at 512 × 512 with [Average Every] 4 Frames in [Scanning] field or 1024 × 1024 with 2 Frames.\nOptional: Increasing [Dwell Time Per Pixel (μs)] may give a clearer image.\nTo obtain serial Z-stack images of the patched neuron and its neurites, configure settings in the [Z-Series] tab as below:\nBring the microscope focus to the very top of the neuron (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A.a), then click the imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2335-Fx4.jpg button to set the [Start Position (μm)].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2335-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Circled crosshairs indicate foci where two-photon laser stimulations were applied sequentially from number 1–9. Inset shows example EPSPs of a patched cell (Cell 1) after glutamate activation of longitudinal DGGCs that have synaptic connections to the patched cell (Linked), or don’t have synaptic connections to it (Not linked). The EPSP disappears after cadmium chloride, a calcium channel blocker, treatment (Cd2+).

To maintain a stable whole-cell configuration, the pipette position may need to be readjusted at least every 5 min to stay close to the cell body (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nZ-stack images are automatically saved in a folder defined by the user. Alternatively, the brightness or contrast can be adjusted for individual images and later use [ImageJ] software to create a stack with specified images.\nGlutamate uncaging at presynaptic neurons\nTiming: 2 h",
    "Steps 44–52 describe the procedure for evoking an EPSP in the patched DG neuron by photostimulation of another DG neuron(s) located in the same DG layer (ventral or dorsal). Steps 53 and 54 repeat the procedure with cadmium chloride (CdCl2) to confirm that the EPSP was evoked by the vesicular release of neurotransmitters from the photostimulated DG neuron.\nFreshly prepare 500 μM MNI-caged-L-glutamate in ACSF solution and perfuse it into the recording chamber. Wait at least 3 min for the solution to diffuse entirely throughout the recording chamber (for a perfusion speed of 1.5 mL/min).\nCritical: Maintain a stable whole-cell configuration during the whole experiment.\nVisualize the unstained brain slice without a halogen light source using Dodt Gradient Contrast (DGC), which improves the contrast of images.\nDeactivate [Ch1 (Channel 1)] in [Image Window] and activate [DODT] button.\nIn [Misc] tab, change [Mirror] to [In] in [Dodt Detector] field.\nClick [Live Scan] in [Scanning] field.\nFind a target area to apply photostimulation (glutamate uncaging), which should contain neurons that are highly likely to have synaptic connections with the patched neuron.\nTarget the molecular layer (ML) hundreds of microns away from a patched neuron.\nBe careful not to shoot the laser on the patch pipette.\nRefer to the imaging to make sure that the target area excludes any dendrites extending from the patched neuron.\nNote: A hippocampal longitudinal slice contains two distinct layers of dentate gyrus granule cells (GC), which are the dorsal and ventral blades of granule cell layers.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] Therefore, target the molecular layer that is continued from the granule cell layer of the patched granule neuron. For example, do not apply photostimulation on the molecular layer that extends from the ventral blade of GC layer, if you have patched a neuron in the dorsal blade of GC layer (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).",
    "Open [Mark Points] from [Image Window] and configure the settings as follows:\nBe sure to optimize the laser duration, power, number of stimulation spots, and dot size beforehand to ensure that they can elicit an action potential in a neuron.\nStart by applying the minimum power (10 mW) for 1 ms laser duration and increase incrementally.\nRest the slices for 30 s between stimulations to avoid hyperexcitation and to give time for presynaptic neurons to recover neurotransmitter vesicles.\n3 × 3 grid of point stimulation (5 ms laser duration, 10 μm spot spacing, and various interpoint delays, > 0.12 ms) at an average power of 42 mW (ranging from 7.5 to 78.08 mW) was used previously3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; the spot size ranged from a diffraction-limited spot of 0.2–1 mm (with laser intensity and objective dependency).\nMake sure to set [First Repetition] under [Wait for Trigger] as well as [Start with external trigger (Trig 1)] under [Trigger Selection] for the Mark Points to hold until you run the protocol under [IC] mode in [Clampex] software that records excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs).\nStop [Live Scan].\nClick [Run Mark Points].\nOn Clampex, click [Record] and visualize the EPSP.\nRest the slices for 30 s between stimulations.\nIf an EPSP was evoked, place the stimulation point grid in the middle of [Image Window] and record the position    P 2  =  (   x 2  ,  y 2  ,  z 2   )    under [Stage Control].",
    "Calculate the distance between the patched neuron and the glutamate uncaging spot (the spot where EPSPs are evoked) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). The approximate distance between two points    P 1  =  (   x 1  ,  y 1  ,  z 1   )    and    P 2  =  (   x 2  ,  y 2  ,  z 2   )    in a three-dimensional space is calculated by the following generalized distance formula:\n      d ( P  1  ,  P 2   )  =     (   x 2  −  x 1   )  2  +   (   y 2  −  y 1   )  2  +   (   z 2  −  z 1   )  2     \nTo confirm that the EPSP was evoked from presynaptic vesicular release, add 0.1 mM cadmium chloride (CdCl2) to the perfusate and wait a few minutes for it to diffuse entirely throughout the recording chamber.\nRepeat steps 45–50 at the position    P 2    and record EPSPs under the effect of CdCl2.\nNote: CdCl2 blocks chemical synaptic transmissions at presynaptic terminals. If the photostimulated neurons (presynaptic neurons excited by uncaged glutamate) have synaptic connections to the patched neuron (postsynaptic neuron), the peak amplitude of EPSPs of the patched neurons should decrease or disappear after the application of CdCl2. As the effects of CdCl2 are reversible, recovery of EPSPs can be observed if steps 45–50 are again repeated without CdCl2.\nAfter the experiment, analyze the peak amplitudes of all EPSPs offline using [Clampfit] software.\nExtracellular field recording\nTiming: 45 min\nExtracellular field recording using longitudinal DG slices allows assessment of the long-term synaptic plasticity of the DG-DG network. Steps 56–69 help to prepare brain slices for extracellular field recording.\nAfter producing 400 μm-thick brain slices, set up the electrophysiology equipment as follows:\nOn one arm of the micromanipulator, secure the concentric bipolar microelectrode (stimulating electrode) that is connected to the electrical stimulus isolator.",
    "On the other arm, mount the Current Clamp and Voltage Clamp Headstage (recording electrode headstage, angled at 20°). Backfill the pulled capillary pipette (recording electrode) with ACSF and mount the glass micropipette to the Headstage.\nAdd picrotoxin to the ACSF perfusion solution (final concentration at 50 μM).\nPerfuse the specimen stage with oxygenated ACSF maintained at 31°C–32°C by an automatic temperature controller, supplied and discharged at a steady rate (1.5 mL/min) using peristaltic pumps.\nCritical: Check frequently to make sure that the stage does not flood and that there are no excessive vibrations or fluid currents.\nGently transfer one brain slice to the specimen stage with a blunted disposable pipette. Place a harp on top of the slice to secure its position.\nAcclimatize the slice on the specimen stage for an additional 30 min.\nLocate the dorsal DG blade under a 10× objective.\nLoad the [Membrane Test] function on [Clampex software].\nRecord the tip resistance as you lower the recording electrode with the micromanipulator until it touches the solution.\nReplace the glass tip if the resistance is out of the desired range (3–4 MΩ).\nVisualize the signals on the Scope window at a 10–20 kHz sampling rate to check for electrical noise.\nNoise range within 0.2 mV is acceptable. If too high, refer to troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] – problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nUsing the micromanipulator, lower the stimulating and recording electrodes to hover just above the slice.\nLower the stimulating electrode to lightly come into contact with the inner molecular layer (IML) of the dorsal blade of DG granule cell layer (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2335-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

The recording electrode on the inner molecular layer (IML) of the dorsal DG measures field EPSPs evoked by current injection through the stimulating electrode placed on the same IML 200–400 μm away from the recording electrode. Figure reprinted with permission from.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] Abbreviations: S, septal; T, temporal; Rec., recording; DG, dentate gyrus; M, molecular layer; dD, dorsal DG granule cell layer; H, hilus.\nLower the recording electrode to touch the same IML of the dorsal blade of DG granule cell layer 200–400 μm away from the stimulating electrode.\nEvoke local field potentials (LFPs) with a minimum constant current at 100 ms duration and repeat at 30-s intervals.\nIn the meantime, adjust the position of the recording electrode to find the area that gives maximum amplitudes and an exemplary shape of LFPs (for reference, see Pak et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nIf no responses are detected, change the location of the recording electrode, or use another brain slice.\nInput/output curve\nTiming: 20 min\nSteps 70–74 help determine the half-maximal stimulation amplitude which is the stimulation intensity that will be applied for assessing synaptic plasticity in steps 75–79.\nConfigure the digitizer, the pulse stimulator, and the electrical stimulus isolator. See the Axon Guide by Molecular Devices for information on how to set up the various equipment. Running a protocol in [Clampex] triggers the [Master-9] pulse stimulator to control the stimulus isolator to stimulate through microelectrode.\nSet the following parameters on [Master-9 Pulse Stimulator] to evoke LFPs:\nMode (M): TRIG (delivers a single pulse).\nDuration (D): 100 μs.\nNumber (N): 1.\nVolt (V): the lowest voltage level (mV) that can evoke LFPs (e.g., ± 3 mV).\nFind the lowest intensity in [stimulus isolator] under the [Current (I)] mode (e.g., magnification X0.1, amplitude 0.3).",
    "Increase the intensity amplitude in [stimulus isolator] and record the peak amplitude of the LFPs (e.g., 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0).\nCritical: Make sure to keep 30-sec intervals between stimulations to prevent cell damage or any changes in short-term synaptic plasticity.\nPlot the intensity versus peak amplitude and determine the intensity that gives half of the maximum LFP amplitude. Use this intensity for all subsequent steps.\nInduce and measure long-term synaptic plasticity\nTiming: 2 h\nBaseline recording – Evoke and record LFPs every 30 s. Apply the half-maximal stimulation intensity determined above. Responses should be stable for at least 20 min before proceeding to the next step.\nNote: Stable synapses give constant responses over time. If unstable, change the location of the recording and/or stimulating electrode, or use the other brain slices.\nConditioning – Set the following parameters in [Master-9 Pulse Stimulator]:\nMode (M): TRAIN (delivers a train of N pulses according to the programmed Delay, Duration, Interval times, and the N parameter).\nDuration (D): 100 μs.\nInterval (I): 900 μs.\nNumber (N): 4.\nTo induce long-term potentiation (LTP), run a stimulation protocol that generates four trains of tetanus stimuli (high-frequency stimulation [HFS]; 100 Hz, 1 s, 4 times at 1- sec intervals).\nPost-conditioning – Change back the [Master-9 Pulse Stimulator] settings to the parameters used in baseline recording. Evoke and record LFPs every 30 s for 1 h.\nCritical: Make sure that the fluid levels and the position of the two electrodes remain constant throughout the whole experiment.\nCompare the mean peak amplitude of the last 10 min of post-conditioning recording to the last 10 min of baseline recording."
