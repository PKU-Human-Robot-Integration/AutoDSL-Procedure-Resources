    "All of the methods described here were approved by the Arcadia University Institutional Review Board.\n1. Design and Prepare the Experiment for Data Collection\nNOTE: See the introduction for general information about design and trial types. See the discussion for more information about specific choices that can be made in each of these sub-steps. See Video 1 for a dynamic view of the task, and Video 2 for a slowed down version of the task.\nChoose trial types (i.e., Target Alone, Same Target Colored distraction, and Different Target Colored distraction as well as either or both of Distractor Alone and Non Target Colored distraction), and the preferred number of trials within each trial type7,20.\nChoose the target-distractor lag lengths in each trial type that contains distractors and targets (e.g., lags 1, 2, 3, and 4, or just lags 1 and 4, etc.)\nChoose colors for the letters - target colors, peripheral distractor colors, and central filler colors; there must be at least two target colors. Ensure that target colors are separated in color space by at least one \"filler\" color that appears in the central RSVP. See Figure 2 for example stimulus colors.\nProgram the task using a flexible and reliable stimulus presentation software package (e.g., Psychtoolbox implemented in MATLAB39).\n\tNOTE: Refer to software tutorials to learn about how to create stimulus presentations and collect responses.\nEnsure that the letter stimuli subtend 2.07 x 1.88 degrees of visual angle and are written in Arial font. Display the peripheral letters 4.22 degrees of visual angle to the right and left of the central letter.\nPresent each frame of the display for 116 ms.\n\tNOTE: There are three letters per frame display: the central letter and two peripheral letters.",
    "Other than when a target appears, assign \"filler\" colors to the letters in the central RSVP (see Figure 1). Assign these colors randomly, with the caveat that no two letters appearing adjacently in time in the RSVP sequence have the same color.\nOther than when a colored peripheral distractor appears, assign the color grey to the letters in the peripheral locations.\nCollect keyboard responses for 1740 ms following every trial.\nRandomize the order of all of the trials throughout the experiment.\nInclude a two-part practice session at the start of the experiment that eases participants into the task and exposes them to all of the trial types.\n\t\nIn the first part, include at least 16 Target Alone trials, presented in all target colors with even representation of each color.\nRemind participants of the to-be-searched target colors by including color patches of these colors that appear just above the RSVP display and keep them fixed throughout the first part of practice.\nStart the practice at a slower RSVP speed, 250 ms per frame. Increase the speed (decrease the frame rate) by 10 ms every time a target is presented until reaching the final experiment speed.\nIn the second part, remove the color patches and introduce trial types with peripheral distractors. Include at least 12 trials in total, and ensure that all trial types are presented at least once.\nProvide participants with self-paced breaks every minute. After 32 trials, halt the continuous RSVP sequence and display a screen that says, \"Please take a break. Press the space bar to continue.\" On this screen, remind participants of the colors they are seeking. Present this text: \"As a reminder, these are your target colors:\" and follow it with \"ABCXYZ\" written in each target color.\n2. Set up the Apparatus",
    "Use a computer with a 60 Hz refresh rate and a monitor and graphics card combination that provides millisecond precision of timing (see the Table of Materials).\nEnsure that the keyboard, monitor, and participant chair are in a fixed location, as proper and consistent spacing from the participant to the computer screen is important. If using a shared space, use masking tape to mark desired locations of equipment on the desk/table.\n3. Recruit participants for the experiment.\nRecruit participants who are 18 - 35 years of age, free of neurological conditions, have corrected to normal vision, and are not colorblind.\nPerform a power calculation using previously published results and/or pilot participants in order to determine the appropriate sample size.40,41\n4. Test the participants\nObtain necessary consent according to the authorizing review board's policies.\nSeat the participants at a distance of 57 cm from the monitor, at which distance 1 cm on the screen corresponds to 1 degree of visual angle. Enforce this viewing distance with the use of a chin rest or with experimenter supervision.\nCheck for colorblindness, by asking the participant completing an online colorblindness test42. Do not analyze data from a participant who is deemed colorblind.\nOpen the software, navigate to the experiment folder, and type the experiment script (designed based upon the guidelines from section 1) into the command window and press enter; the program will run.\nHelp the participant through the instructions, which are printed on a series of screens and can be read in a self-paced fashion. In addition to reading the instructions on the screen, state the following: \"This task is very difficult, with performance averaging about 75% correct. Do not be discouraged if you feel you are making many mistakes.)\"",
    "Supervise the participant during the experiment to ensure that he/she maintains a uniform viewing distance from the monitor, is completing the task properly (e.g., using the correct response keys used), and is not falling asleep or becoming distracted.\nProvide feedback and encouragement during the practice session.\n\t\nRemind the participants of the key responses. Tell them, \"Remember, the \"J\" response key is for any target letter coming from the first half of the alphabet, and the \"K\" response key is for any target letter coming from the second half of the alphabet. Do not press \"J\" for one target color and \"K\" for the other.\"\nRemind participants to slow down and consider which response to make after identifying a letter, and that the response well be recorded as \"correct\" even if it does not occur immediately.\nWhen the program concludes, debrief and dismiss the participant. Explain the purpose of the experiment and answer questions. Ask if the participant had any difficulties with the experiment or with completing the task.\nSubscription Required.
