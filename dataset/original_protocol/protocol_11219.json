    "All experimentation using patient-derived gastric cancer stem cells described herein was approved by the local ethical committee7.\n1. Gastric cancer stem cell culture\nPreparation of GCSCs complete culture medium\n\t\nPrepare GCSCs complete culture medium by adding fresh DME/F12 medium with the following essential ingredients: 20 ng/mL EGF, 10 ng/mL bFGF, 1% Insulin/Transferrin/Sodium selenite, 0.2% glucose, 0.5% B27, 1% Glutamax, 1% Non-essential amino acid, 10 µM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.75 mg/mL NaHCO3, 10 µM thioglycerol, 100 IU/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. Filter and sterilize using a 0.22 µm filter.\n\t\tNOTE: GCSCs complete culture medium is recommended stored preferably no more than two weeks at 4 °C.\nRecovery of GCSCs and culture\n\tNOTE: GCSCs were obtained as follows: Tumor samples were subjected to mechanical and enzymatic dissociation. Single cell suspensions were obtained by filtering with nylon net from well-scattered suspension. The resulting cancer cells were cultured in GCSCs Complete Culture Medium, and some cells grew to form spheres. These spheres were then subjected to enzymatic dissociation, and GCSCs can be obtained by cytofluorometric sorting of the cell population stained with CD44/CD54 markers. The detailed protocol and functional assays of the GCSCs have been reported7.\n\t\nPre-warm GCSCs complete culture medium at 37 °C for no more than 30 min.\nDefrost GCSCs from liquid nitrogen storage and rapidly thaw cryovials in a 37 °C water bath. Keep swirling the vials until the entire content melts totally.\n\t\tNOTE: Thaw frozen cells rapidly (<1 min) in a 37 °C water bath.\nTransfer the entire contents of the cryovials into a 15 mL centrifuge tube containing 10 mL of GCSCs complete culture medium. Centrifuge at 800 x g for 5 min at RT.",
    "Aspirate the supernatant carefully and suspend the cell pellet in 10 mL of fresh GCSCs complete medium. Plate the cell suspension in a 100 mm Petri dish. Incubate the plate at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator and add 5 mL of fresh complete medium on the third day.\nSubculture of GCSCs tumorspheres\n\tNOTE: GCSCs of the tumorspheres center only have sufficient nutrients before the spheres size growing up to 80-100 µm in diameter. Once dark and low refractivity spheres appear (about 6 days of culture), it is necessary to subculture the tumorspheres.\n\t\nShake the dish gently and transfer the GCSCs tumorsphere culture medium (the medium and the non-adherent tumorspheres) into a sterile 15 mL centrifuge tube. For larger medium volumes, larger centrifuge tubes may be needed.\nCentrifuge at 600 x g for 5 min and carefully dispose of the supernatant. After centrifugation, an off-white pellet will be visible.\nAdd 2 mL of cell dissociation solution to resuspend the pellet for mechanical and enzymatic dissociation at 37 °C. Gently pipet up and down 10 times every 2-3 min in the digestion procedure to break the spheres apart until the tumorspheres are dispersed into single cell suspension. This total dissociation process is recommended to be less than 15 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Perform a visual check under the microscope to confirm that no large spheres or cell aggregates remain.\nAdd 10 mL of fresh pre-warmed GCSCs complete culture medium (5x the volume of the cell detachment solution) to terminate digestion procedure and centrifuge at 800 x g at RT for 5 min.",
    "Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cells with 1 mL of fresh pre-warmed GCSCs complete culture medium. Seed an appropriate number of cells into a new 100 mm Petri dish with 10 mL of fresh pre-warmed GCSCs complete culture medium and incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nRefeed tumorspheres cultures after 3 days by adding 5 mL of fresh pre-warmed complete medium. After 6 days, passage cells when tumorspheres grow up to 80-100 µm in diameter.\nCryopreservation of GCSCs\n\tNOTE: Do not cryopreserve GCSCs cells by adding medium to tumorspheres directly. GCSCs tumorspheres should be digested into single cells so that cell protective agent could enter every cell to ensure the long-term stable storage of cells. Make sure the cells are in healthy situation and without contamination.\n\t\nHarvest GCSCs tumorspheres. Centrifuge at 600 x g for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and add 2 mL of cell dissociation solution to dissociate GCSCs tumorspheres at 37 °C. Terminate the digestion procedure by adding 10 mL of GCSCs complete culture medium.\nCentrifuge at 800 x g for 5 min and collect single GCSCs.\nGently suspend GCSCs with serum-free cryopreservative medium. The recommended final concentration is 5 x 105 - 5 x 106 cells/mL.\nDispense the cell suspension in 1 mL aliquots into marked cryogenic vials.\nImmediately place the cryovials containing the cells in an isopropanol chamber and store them at -80 °C. Transfer the vials to liquid nitrogen the following day for long-term storage.\n2. Generation of inducible knockdown GCSCs lines\nCAUTION: Recombinant lentiviruses have been designated as Level 2 organisms by the National Institute of Health and Center for Disease Control. Work involving lentivirus requires the maintenance of a Biosafety Level 2 facility, considering that the viral supernatants produced by these lentiviral systems could contain potentially hazardous recombinant virus.",
    "Generation of lentivirus particles\n\t\nSynthesize 2 lentiviral vectors carrying inducible shRNA targeting human clusterin and a non-targeting control lentiviral vector (GV307) from GeneChem based on the design of Table 1 (GV307 vector contains: TetIIP-TurboRFP-MCS(MIR30)-Ubi-TetR-IRES-Puromycin).\nSeed 4 x 106 293T lenti-viral packaging cells into a 100 mm Petri dish with 10 mL of DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.\nIncubate 293T cells overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Make sure that 293T cell density is about 50-80% confluent the day of transfection.\nBring the reduced serum medium to room temperature and prepare Tube A and Tube B as described in Table 2.\nTransfer Tube A into Tube B, mix well, and incubate the complexes for 20 min at room temperature to prepare lipid-DNA complexes.\nRemove 5 mL of medium, before adding lipid-DNA complex, leaving a total of 5 mL.\nAdd 5 mL of lipid-DNA complex into the culture dish dropwise and gently swirl the dish to distribute the complex.\n\t\tNOTE: Carefully dispense liquid against the dish wall to avoid disturbing 293T cells.\nIncubate culture dish for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nAfter 24 hours post-transfection, carefully remove the transfection medium and gently replace with 10 mL of pre-warmed DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Incubate for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\n\t\tNOTE: All the supernatant and tips should be treated with 10% bleach prior to disposal.\nApproximately after 48 hours post-transfection, harvest 10 mL of lentivirus-containing supernatants.\n\t\tNOTE: All the cell culture vessels and tips should be treated with 10% bleach prior to disposal.\nFilter the lentiviral supernatant using a 0.45 µm pore filter to remove cellular debris.\n\t\tNOTE: All filters and syringes should be treated with 10% bleach prior to disposal.",
    "Transfer clarified supernatant to a sterile container, add Lenti-X Concentrator (1/3 volume of clarified supernatant) to mix by gentle inversion.\nIncubate mixture at 4 °C overnight.\nCentrifuge samples at 1,500 x g for 45 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, and off-white pellet will be visible. Carefully remove supernatant, taking care not to disturb the pellet.\n\t\tNOTE: All the supernatant and tips should be treated with 10% bleach prior to disposal.\nGently resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS as virus stock, store at -80 °C.\nGeneration of stable transfected cell lines\n\t\nSeed 6 x 106 GCSCs into a 100 mm Petri dish with 10 mL DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 (70-80% confluence prior to infection).\nAspirate the medium in the dish, add the concentrated lentiviral particles diluted with 4 mL of complete DMEM medium containing polybrene reagent (5 µg/mL) into the dish. Incubate for 18 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\n\t\tNOTE: The optimal concentration of polybrene depends on cell type and may need to be test in different concentrations to decide the effective concentrations. Otherwise, it may be empirically determined, usually in the range of 2-10 µg/mL. All the tubes and tips should be treated with 10% bleach prior to disposal.\nChange the medium, replace with 10 mL of DMEM with 10% FBS medium and incubate for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\n\t\tNOTE: All the medium and the tips should be treated with 10% bleach prior to disposal.",
    "Aspirate the supernatant with cell debris, replace with fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS medium containing puromycin (2.5 µg/mL) and incubate for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Then replace fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS medium containing puromycin (5 µg/mL) and incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for additional 24 h.\nRinse the adherent GCSCs twice with 5 mL of DPBS without calcium and magnesium.\nDissociate GCSCs with 1 mL of pre-warmed cell dissociation solution and incubate 2-3 min at 37 °C.\nAdd 5 mL of fresh pre-warmed GCSCs complete culture medium to the cell suspension.\nDispense 3 mL into a 15 mL centrifugal tube (tube A) for cryopreserving the cells, and the other 3 mL into a 15 mL centrifugal tube (tube B) for inducing by doxycycline.\nCentrifuge tube A and tube B at 800 x g for 5 min.\nResuspend the pellet of tube A with 1 mL of serum-free cryopreservative medium, transfer the vial to -80 °C overnight, and remove it into liquid nitrogen storage.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells of tube B in 1 mL of fresh pre-warmed GCSCs complete culture medium. Seed an appropriate number of cells into a new 100 mm Petri dish of 10 mL fresh pre-warmed GCSCs complete culture medium with doxycycline (Dox) (2.5 µg/mL) and incubate for 48 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\n\t\tNOTE: The optimal concentration of Dox may vary between cell lines. Each cell line should be tested in different Dox concentrations to decide the effective concentrations for KD and for toxicity on the cells.\nConfirm stable repression of clusterin in GCSCs by western blotting.\n3. Sphere formation assay\nThaw the frozen inducible knockdown GCSCs lines (see step 1.2).\nDetermine viable cell density of a 10 µL sample using an Automated Cell Counter.",
