    "1. Preparation of Cells for Flow Cytometry Sorting\nInoculate 15 mL test tubes containing 8 mL each of YEPD broth such that the cultures reach a density of 5 x 106 to 1.5 x 107 cells per mL after overnight growth (see discussion note 1).\nSpin down yeast cells (1,400 x g, at room temperature or 4 °C) in a 15 mL screw cap centrifuge tube for 5 min, resuspend cells in 1.5 mL 70% ethanol, and transfer to a 1.6 mL microfuge tube, letting this sit for 1 h at room temperature or at least 3 h on ice (can be stored indefinitely at 4 °C) (see Discussion point (2)).\nSpin down yeast cells in the microfuge (14,000 x g, 4 °C) for 1 min, resuspend in 1 mL 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.2, spin down (14,000 x g, 4 °C) for 1 min, aspirate supernatant, resuspend in 1 mL 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.2, containing 0.25 mg/mL RNAse solution for 1 h at 50 °C or overnight at 37 °C in heat block or water bath.\nAdd 50 µL proteinase K solution (20 mg/mL resuspended in 10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 2 mM CaCl2, 50% weight to volume glycerol) and incubate for 1 h at 50 °C.\nSpin down cells (14,000 x g, 4 °C), resuspend cells in 1 mL 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.2, spin down (14,000 x g, 4 °C), aspirate supernatant with vacuum, resuspend in 1 mL 1 µM Green nucleic acid strain resuspended in 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.2 and incubate in the dark for 1 h at room temperature, sonicate 2x for 2 s each (output power 2 watts).\n2. Cell Sorting",
    "Using a cell sorter, sort cells according to DNA content into phases G1, S, \"early G2,\" and \"late G2\", collecting at least 1.6 million haploid cells from each cell cycle phase as in Figure 1 (see Discussion point (3)).\nTransfer cells to microfuge tubes and spin down cells for 20 min at 14,000 x g at 4 °C in the microfuge and aspirate supernatant with vacuum (the pellet can be stored frozen at -20 °C indefinitely; see discussion point (4)).\n3. DNA Extraction and the Preparation of Sequencing Libraries\nNOTE: The following steps are based on \"protocol I\" in the Yeast Genomic DNA extraction Kit (see Table of Materials).\nAdd 120 µL of \"Digestion Buffer,\" a proprietary buffer that allows yeast lytic enzyme to digest the cell wall, and 5 µL of yeast lytic enzyme, resuspend by vortexing, and incubate at 37 °C for 40 - 60 min.\nAdd 120 µL of \"Lysis Buffer,\" a proprietary buffer that contains detergent, and vortex hard for 10 - 20 s.\nAdd 250 µL chloroform - mix thoroughly for 1 min.\nSpin at maximum speed in a microfuge for 2 min.\nLoad the supernatant onto the DNA binding column and centrifuge at maximum speed in a microfuge for 1 min.\nAdd 300 µL of \"DNA Washing Buffer,\" a proprietary buffer that contains ethanol, and centrifuge for 1 min at maximum speed in a microfuge. Discard the flow through, add 300 µL of DNA Wash Buffer, and repeat the wash process.\nTransfer the spin column to a fresh microfuge tube, add 60 µL of water (not TE) - wait 1 - 3 min and then centrifuge for 10 s to elute the DNA.",
    "Measure concentration by adding 5 µL of DNA to 195 µL of dsDNA high sensitivity reagent that has been diluted 1:200 in dsDNA high sensitivity buffer and then measure fluorescence in a fluorometer, using 10 µL of supplied standards for calibration; expect between 10 and 50 ng of DNA total yield.\nSonicate (Peak Incident Power 450, Duty Factor 30%, Cycles per Burst 200, Treatment Time 60 s, Water Level 6) to break up DNA into 250 - 350 bp fragments.\nPrepare a library using DNA sample preparation kit and sequence it (at least 10 million 50 bp single-end reads) on the DNA sequencing instrument in rapid mode (see discussion note (5)).\n4. Analysis of Sequencing Data and Generation of Replication Profiles\nAlign sequences to Saccharomyces cerevisiae sacCer3 genome using Gsnap12 (see discussion note (6)).\nDetermine per-base pair read depths using Bedtools' \"genomeCoverageBed\" software13.\nRemove artefactual spikes in read depths, if present (see discussion note (7)).\nSmooth read depths by chromosome using medians in a 20 kb sliding window using \"runMean\" function in R package \"caTools\" (see discussion note (8)).\nPlot read depths in S phase, early G2, and late G2 as a percentage of completely replicated read depths (see discussion note (9)).\nSubscription Required.
