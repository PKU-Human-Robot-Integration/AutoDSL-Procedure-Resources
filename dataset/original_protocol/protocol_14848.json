    "NOTE: The use of human participants was approved by the Faculty of Health Sciences Ethics Committee at the University of Southampton. All participants signed consent forms before data collection commenced. For the data presented in this study kinematics were recorded using a passive marker motion capture system consisting of 12 cameras; six 4-megapixel cameras and six 16-megapixel cameras operating at sampling frequency of 120 Hz.\n1. Participant Preparation\nAsk subjects to remove their upper body clothing or to wear a sports bra, vest, or strapless top. It is important that clothing does not interfere with the movement of the markers or occlude markers from the view of the cameras.\nConstruct an acromion marker cluster consisting of an ‘L’ shaped piece of plastic 70 mm in length along each aspect. Attach three retroreflective markers to the AMC, one on the end of each end of each aspect and one where each aspect meet (Figure 1).\nAttach the acromion marker cluster (AMC) onto the posterior portion of the acromion where the acromion meets the scapular spine, using double sided adhesive tape. One aspect of the plate should follow the spine of the scapula pointing medially, the other should point anterior to the scapular plane (Figure 1).\nAttach a cluster marker set to the upper arm using straps (Figure 2).\nAttach retroreflective markers to the following anatomical landmarks at recommended by the International Society of Biomechanics33 (Figures 1 & 2): Sternal notch (IJ; Deepest joint of the sternal notch), Xiphoid process (PX; Most caudal point on the sternum), C7 (Spinous process of the C7 vertebra), T8 (Spinous process of the T8 vertebra), Sternoclavicular joint (SC; Most ventral point on the sternoclavicular joint), Radial styloid (Most caudal point on the radial styloid), and Ulnar styloid (Most caudal point on the ulnar styloid).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51717/51717fig1highres.jpg",

Participant Calibration\nNOTE: Locations of the scapula’s anatomical landmarks need to be determined with respect to the acromion marker cluster. Calibration of the landmarks is required for each participant.\nConstruct a calibration wand consisting of four reflective markers placed into a ‘T’ formation (Figure 3). Measure the distance from the tip of the calibration wand to the first wand marker.\nPalpate and locate the following anatomical landmarks as recommended by the International Society of Biomechanics33. Place the tip of the calibration wand on the landmark (Figure 3). Capture three seconds of data with the motion capture system ensuring the markers on the wand, the AMC and upper arm cluster are all visible to the cameras.\n\t\nAcromioclavicular joint (AC) — Place a hand on the clavicle, then move laterally until the point where the clavicle reaches the acromion. Place the tip of the wand at the joint between the clavicle and acromion.\nAcromion angle (AA) — Palpate along the spine of the scapula to the most lateral point. Place the tip of the wand on the dorsal aspect of the acromion at the most lateral point (Figure 3).\nMedial spine of the scapula (TS) — Palpate along the spine of the scapula to the most medial point. Place the tip of the wand at the point where the spine meets the medial border of the scapula.",
    "Inferior angle of the scapula (AI) — Palpate inferiorly along the medial border of the scapula. Place the tip of the wand on the most caudal point of the scapula.\nMedial epicondyle (EM) — With the participant’s elbow in 90° of flexion pointing forward, with their thumb pointing upwards, place a hand on the medial side of the elbow to locate the medial epicondyle. Place the tip of the wand on the most caudal point of the medial epicondyle.\nLateral epicondyles (EL) — With the participant’s elbow in 90° of flexion pointing forward, with their thumb pointing upwards, place a hand on the lateral side of the elbow to locate the lateral epicondyle. Place the tip of the wand on the most caudal point of the lateral epicondyle.\nTo determine the glenohumeral joint center, ask the participant to perform a circumduction movement with their upper arm with the elbow fully extended, from zero degrees arm elevation to approximately 40° arm elevation. They must perform this movement whilst aiming to minimize protraction/retraction and elevation/depression of the shoulder complex; the investigator can provide assistance if necessary. Record this movement for approximately 30 sec.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51717/51717fig3highres.jpg\nFigure 3: Calibration wand used to locate anatomical bony landmark with respect the acromion marker cluster (AMC).\n3. Experiment Protocol\nAsk participant to perform arm elevation from zero to 120° arm elevation, and then lower their arm back down to rest by their side in the sagittal, frontal and scapular plane. The scapular plane is approximately 40° anterior to the frontal plane.\n4. Post-processing of Kinematic Data",
    "NOTE: The following steps detail the procedure needed to calculate scapular kinematics during the dynamic movement trials. These steps have been described and explored extensively within the literature21,33,34 and the purpose of the following section is to provide a synthesis and step-by-step guide to implementing the modeling steps required to obtain scapular kinematics. The application of these steps is conducted in relevant kinematic modeling software. The software contains commands to enable the creation of local coordinate systems, the conversion of coordinates from a global to local coordinate system, the conversion of coordinates from local to global coordinate systems and the calculation of Euler angle rotations. These steps will allow the scapula, humerus and thorax to be defined as rigid bodies. Subsequently rotation of the scapula with respect the thorax, and the humerus with respect thorax can then be determined.\nUsing the coordinates of markers on the AMC, define an arbitrary local coordinate system for the AMC (Figure 4a). For each scapular anatomical landmark calibration trial, determine the location of the tip of the wand, which represents the location of the anatomical landmark, with respect the local coordinate system on the AMC using the following steps.\n\tNOTE: Kinematic modeling software contain commands to enable the creation of local coordinate systems and conversion of coordinates from a global to a local coordinates, see Figure 4 for example commands.\n\t\nUse the markers on the wand to create a local coordinate system for the wand (Figure 4a) using the following command in the kinematic modeling software: AMC= [AMCO,AMCA-AMCO,AMCO-AMCM,xyz] where AMCO, AMCA and AMCM are the labels given to the markers on the AMC.",
    "Using the kinematic modeling software, calculate the location of the tip of the wand in the global coordinate system. In the example provided this is 83 mm from the marker 1 (M1) along the X axis of the wand (Figure 4b); use the command: Wand = [M1,M1-M2,M3-M4,xyz] and Wandtip = M1+{83,0,0}*ATTITUDE(Wand) where M1, M2, M3 and M4 are the labels given to the markers on the wand.\nDetermine the location of the tip of the wand with respect to the local coordinate system of the AMC ($%AA) (Figure 4c) using the modeling commands: $%AA = WandTip/AMC and PARAM($%AA).\nRepeat steps 4.1.1 to 4.1.3 for each scapular anatomical landmark.\nDetermine the location of the medial and lateral epicondyles with respect to the humerus marker cluster, instead of the AMC, using the using the above steps.\nUse the dynamic calibration trial to calculate the location of the glenohumeral joint center with respect to the scapula. Calculate the position of the glenohumeral joint center, with respect to the scapula, as the pivot point of the helical axis between the humerus and scapula. For more details on this technique refer to Veeger35.\nCalculate the elbow joint center (ELJC) as the mid-distance between the lateral (EL) and medial epicondyles (EM) of the humerus; ELJC = (EM + EL) / 2.\nDuring the dynamic trials, use the known position of the anatomical landmarks with respect to the AMC to determine the location of the anatomical landmarks within the global coordinate system (Figure 5).\n\tNOTE: Modeling software contain commands to enable conversion of coordinates from local coordinate systems to global coordinate systems, see Figure 5 for example commands.\n\t\nRefer to Figure 5a that shows the location of the acromion angle landmark with respect to the AMC ($%AA) as described in point 4.1.",
    "Convert the location of $%AA virtual marker to the global coordinate system for each time point during the dynamic trial to create the acromion angle (AA) landmark (Figure 5b) using the following kinematic modeling command: AA = $%AA*AMC and OUTPUT(AA).\nRepeat steps 4.4.2 for each anatomical landmark.\nDefine a local coordinate system for the thorax and scapula by calculating the unit vectors between the relevant markers to represent each axis for a given rigid body using the following kinematic modeling command: Scapula = [AA,TS-AA,AA-AI,zxy]. Thorax = [IJ,MUTHX-MLTHX,IJ-C7,yzx], where MUTHX is the mid-point between the IJ and C7 landmark and MLTHX is the mid-point between the PX and T8 landmarks.\n\tNOTE: The axes definition are based on International Society of Biomechanics’ (ISB) recommendations33 (Table 1 and Figure 6).\n\t\nUsing a similar method, define a local coordinate system for the humerus using ‘Option 2’ as recommended by the ISB33.\n\t\tNOTE: Option 2 requires a sufficient plane formed by the gleohumeral joint center, elbow joint center and the ulna styloid, i.e. a degree of elbow flexion is required. If the participant approaches full elbow extension, the humeral axes may become unstable and therefore ‘Option 1’ should be used (Table 1). See Wu et al. (2005) for further details.\nDetermine the orientation of the scapula relative to the thorax for each time point during the dynamic trial using the Euler angle decomposition method with a rotation sequence of internal rotation (Y), upward rotation (X’) and posterior tilt (Z’’)33 using the following kinematic modeling command: ScapularKin = -<Thorax,Scapula,yxz> (Figure 7).\nDetermine the orientation of the humerus with respect to the thorax during the dynamic trial using a non-cardan rotation sequence of Y (plane of elevation), X’ (elevation) and Y’’ (axial rotation)36 using relevant kinematic modeling software.",

Data Reduction and Analysis\nNOTE: The following data reduction and analysis steps are performed in numerical modeling software (such as MATLAB) that allows manipulation of data matrices. The kinematic data is divided into the elevation and lowering phases of humeral movement, time normalized for each phase of movement, then scapular kinematics are expressed relative to humeral elevation angle.\nDetermine the elevation and lowering phase of the humeral elevation as described below (Figure 8). These phases are determined from the angular velocity of the humeral elevation angle (Figure 8). See ElevationLoweringPhases.m function file.\n\t\nDetermine the start of humeral elevation when the angular velocity of the humerus exceeds a threshold 2% of the maximal humeral angular velocity.\nDetermine the end of the elevation phase as the point at which the humeral angular velocity falls below 2% of the maximal humeral angular velocity, or when humeral elevation exceeds 120°.\nDetermine the start of the humeral lowering phase when the angular velocity falls below 2% of the minimum angular velocity, or the point at which humeral elevation falls below 120°.\nDetermine the end of the lowering phase when the angular velocity exceeds 2% of the minimum angular velocity.\nNormalize the data by interpolating the kinematic data in each phase of movement to 101 data points (Figure 9).
