    "NOTE: All culture media and buffer compositions are specified in Table 1. Prior to cybrid generation, both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA profiles from the donor and recipient cells must be typed to confirm the presence of genetic differences in both genomes between cell lines. In this study, a commercially available L929 cell line and its derived cell line, L929dt, which was spontaneously generated in our laboratory (see13 for more information) were used. These cell lines present two differences in the sequence of their mt-Nd2 gene which can be used to confirm the purity of mtDNA once the cybridization process has been finished13. In this case, the purity of the nuclear background was confirmed by antibiotic sensitivity, since, contrary to L929dt cells, L929 were resistant to geneticin.\n1. Mitochondrial depletion by rhodamine 6G treatment (recipient cells)\nNOTE: The first step for successful cybrid generation is to completely and irreversibly abolish mitochondrial functions in the recipient cells. For this purpose, it is necessary to previously determine, for each cell line, the appropriate concentration and treatment duration with rhodamine 6G. This adequate concentration should be just below drug-induced cell death (the highest that does not kill the cells during the treatment). Perform the following once the optimal conditions are defined.\nSeed 106 cells in a 6-well plate using complete culture medium (see Table 1 for details) and treat them daily with the optimal concentration of rhodamine 6G for 3-10 days, depending on the cell line. Traditional concentrations range from 2 to 5 µg/mL for 3-10 days20,21. In this study, for L929-derived cells, 2.5 µg/mL rhodamine 6G for 7 days was the selected treatment13,22.\nTo keep the cells alive, supplement the cell culture medium with 50 µg/mL of uridine and 100 µg/mL of pyruvate and renew it every 24 h.",
    "After treatment and prior to fusion, change the medium of rhodamine 6G-treated cells to complete cell culture medium without rhodamine 6G, and leave them in this medium for 3-4 h in an incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\n\tNOTE: The rhodamine 6G toxic effect is irreversible, and cells with non-functional mitochondria should not recover20. Thus, after treatment, cells that do not receive functional mitochondria should die even in uridine-supplemented culture medium. Therefore, no nuclear selection should be necessary. However, a control fusion of rhodamine 6G-treated cells without mitochondria is recommended.\n2. Expansion and mitochondrial isolation (donor cells)\nExpand the mitochondria donor cells during the time lapse of rhodamine 6G treatment to obtain around 25 x 106 cells.\nOn day 7, harvest exponentially growing cells in a 50 mL tube and collect them by centrifugation at 520 x g for 5 min at room temperature (RT). Wash the cells 3x with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and sediment them by centrifugation at 520 x g for 5 min at RT. From now on, perform all the steps of mitochondrial extraction at 4 °C, using cold reagents and keeping the tubes with cells or mitochondria on ice.\nAfter the third centrifugation, discard the supernatant by aspiration using a glass pipette coupled to a vacuum pump and resuspend the packed cells in a volume of hypotonic buffer equal to 7x the cell pellet volume. Then, transfer the cell suspension into a homogenizer tube and let the cells swell by incubating them on ice for 2 min.\nBreak the cell membranes by performing 8 to 10 strokes in the homogenizer coupled to a motor-driven pestle rotating at 600 rpm.\n\tNOTE: The step of cell membrane disruption can vary between cell types; thus, it has to be optimized for each cell type.",
    "Add the same volume of hypertonic buffer to the cell suspension (7x the cell pellet volume) to generate an isotonic environment.\nTransfer the homogenate into a 15 mL tube and centrifuge it in a fixed rotor at 1,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Then, collect only 3/4 of the supernatant leaving a large margin from the pellet, to avoid contamination with nuclei or intact cells, and transfer it to another tube. Repeat the same process twice. Note that the supernatant must be kept and the pellet discarded.\nSave the mitochondrial fraction (supernatant). Transfer it into 1.5 mL tubes and centrifuge at maximum speed (18,000 x g) for 2 min at 4 °C.\nDiscard the supernatant and wash the mitochondria-enriched pellet with buffer A, combining the content of the two tubes into one and centrifuging at the same conditions as described in step 2.7. Repeat the same process until all the material is in only one tube.\nMake an additional wash with 300 µL of buffer A and quantify the mitochondrial protein concentration using the Bradford assay23. For each cybridization assay, the optimal amount of mitochondria for the transfer procedure has to be determined (in our case, a concentration between 10-40 µg of mitochondrial protein per 106 cells).\nSimultaneously, prepare the rhodamine 6G-pretreated cells for the fusion by collecting them in a 15 mL tube and centrifuging at 520 x g for 5 min at RT. Note that the pellet acquires a neon pink color due to rhodamine 6G treatment.",
    "To ensure that both mitochondrial function abolishment in receptor cells as well as organelle purification from donors have been properly performed, seed a small number of rhodamine 6G-treated cells and isolated mitochondria using the complete culture medium in a 6-well plate and culture them for a month to check that no surviving cells remain in any of the wells (Figure 2).\nIn parallel, evaluate the absence of nuclei contaminants in the mitochondrial fraction by immunodetection of nuclear proteins (i.e., lamin beta, histone H3, etc.) or by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) amplification of a nuclear gene (i.e., SDH, 18S rRNA, etc.).\n\tNOTE: To avoid contaminations, it is recommended to perform all the steps in aseptic conditions working under a laminar flow hood.\n3. Fusion and cybrid generation\nTo proceed with the fusion, carefully add 106 of the rhodamine 6G-treated cells to the isolated mitochondria pellet (10-40 µg of mitochondrial protein) and centrifuge at 520 x g for 5 min to allow the cells to mix with the mitochondria.\nAdd 100 µL of polyethylene glycol (PEG, 50%) and gently resuspend the pellet for 30 s. Then, allow to rest untouched for another 30 s.\nFinally, transfer the mix into a 6-well plate with fresh complete cell culture medium and place in the incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After a few days (usually 1 week), transmitochondrial cybrids should start growing (Figure 2), giving rise to clones that can be individually selected or mixed in a pool prior to their analysis.\n4. Verification of both mitochondrial and nuclear background",
    "NOTE: Once the new cell line has been established and cells begin to grow exponentially, the purity of their mitochondrial and nuclear DNAs must be verified. Thus, the original cell lines should harbor different mutations or polymorphisms within their genomes to make them recognizable.\nTotal DNA isolation\n\t\nIsolate the genomic DNA of all cell lines used for cybrid generation by employing a commercial genomic DNA extraction kit (see Table of Materials) or by performing a standard protocol using phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extraction and alcohol precipitation24.\nmtDNA evaluation (Figure 3)\n\tNOTE: Several techniques, such as sequencing, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, or allele-specific qPCR, can be performed to analyze the purity of mtDNA. To confirm the presence of mtDNA sequence variations by RFLP, follow the next protocol steps.\n\t\nAmplify an mtDNA fragment containing the nucleotide change by PCR.\n\t\t\nHere, L929dt cells present an mtDNA mutation at position 4206, within an mt-Nd2 gene (m.4206C>T) that is absent in L929 cells. To confirm the presence of this substitution in the transmitochondrial cybrids, amplify a 397 bp fragment by PCR using a standard protocol and the following primers: 1) 5'-AAGCTATCGGG\n\t\t\tCCCATACCCCG-3' (positions 3862-3884) and 2) 5'-TAATCAGAAGTGGAATGGGGCG -3' (positions 4236-4258).\nAnalyze the presence of the desired nucleotide substitution by RFLP, using a specific endonuclease that recognizes the sequence change and generates a different cut pattern for both cell lines.",
    "NOTE: When the L929dt mtDNA variant is present (4206T), the amplicon obtained in step 4.2.1 contains two restriction sites for SspI (see Table of Materials) that produces three DNA fragments of 306 bp, 52 bp, and 39 bp. The restriction site that generates the 52 and 39 bands is disrupted when the wild-type (WT) version C4206 is present, and a new band of 91 bp appears. Therefore, an internal control for full digestion for SspI is included in the analysis. The digestion reaction is performed at 37 °C, following the manufacturer's instructions.\nSeparate the restriction fragments by electrophoresis and compare the band pattern.\n\t\t\nOnce the digestion is performed, analyze the obtained restriction fragments by electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide-Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) gels (see Table 1 for 1x TBE composition). Run the electrophoresis at 80 V for 1 h at RT. Visualize the DNA fragments after gel staining in a solution of ethidium bromide in 1x TBE for 15 min at RT (see Table 1 for gel staining solution composition).\nNuclear DNA genotyping\n\tNOTE: Nuclear DNA genotyping must be performed using the previous DNA extraction sample employed for RFLP analysis.\n\t\nAmplify 16 loci (D21S11, CSF1PO, vWA, D8S1179, TH01, D18S51, D5S818, D16S539, D3S1358, D2S1338, TPOX, FGA, D7S820, D13S317, D19S433, and AMEL) by using a pool of commercial-specific oligonucleotides (see Table of Materials).\nPerform electrophoresis by using a genetic analyzer in order to separate the fragments previously obtained.\n\t\tNOTE: Once amplified, the different loci are analyzed by electrophoresis using a capilar system (see Table of Materials). The fragments are separated in a 50 cm long capilar filled with a commercial polymer. Cathode and anode buffers are also commercially available, as shown in the Table of Materials. Electrophoresis is performed at 19.5 kV for 20 min at 60 °C.",
    "Use bioinformatical tools to determine the alleles corresponding to each amplified locus (see Table of Materials).\nCompare the data obtained in step 4.3.3 with the nuclear DNA profile database (Table 1), to check if the nuclear DNA profile matches with the mitochondria receptor cell line profile (Figure 4).\nSubscription Required.
