    "All mice used in these assays were obtained from BALB/c mice strains, using male and female mice indiscriminately. Previous culture experiments have also been performed using other strains, such as FVB, Swiss mice, CD-1, and CsA mice11,12,14. All mice were housed according to National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines, Appendix Q. Procedures involving animal subjects have been approved by the Institutional Animals Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education at Ensenada (CICESE).\n1. Calvarial dissection\nSterilize dissection instruments (e.g., 1 x 2 teeth tissue forceps, straight surgical scissors, dissecting scissors, fine-tipped tweezers, fine curved tip dissecting forceps, dissecting forceps, scalpel). Sterile distilled water can be used to clean the surgical tools between each dissection, and sterile 1x PBS can be used for cleaning each hemi-calvaria.\nPlace the sterile dissection instruments, water, 1x PBS, and required materials to carry out the procedure (e.g., micropipettes, precipitate glasses, sterile Petri dishes) in a laminar flow hood.\n\tNOTE: Carry out the entire procedure under sterile conditions.\nAdd 12 mL of sterile 1x PBS into two 10 cm Petri dishes.\nSelect the pups and place them near the hood.\n\tNOTE: Dissect the calvarias from 5-7 day old pups.\nPick and hold the mouse carefully using dissecting forceps.\nDecapitate the mouse using dissecting scissors and place the head in a Petri dish with PBS.\n\tNOTE: Decapitation is not suitable for older mice. If the experiment must be done with older mice, the method of euthanasia should be modified according to the animal experimentation rules.\nHold the head firmly by the nose area with 1 x 2 teeth tissue forceps and remove the skin over the skull until the calvaria is visible.\nIdentify the sutures (i.e., sagittal, coronal, and lambdoid) of the skull on the exposed calvaria.",
    "Penetrate with the tip of the microscissors approximately 2 mm behind the lambdoid suture and make a straight cut alongside it.\nInsert the tip of the microscissors on the rear side of the skull. Make a straight cut along the distal side of the lambdoid suture towards the coronal suture. Proceed similarly with the other lambdoid suture.\nMake another cut (at a 45° angle) to connect the end of the cut made with the cut of the anterior fontanel.\nRepeat steps 1.10 and 1.11 with the other lambdoid suture.\n\tNOTE: It is important to identify the sutures to make appropriate cuts and to be able to perform adequate embedding and data analysis.\nUse fine-tip forceps to remove the calvaria and place it in a Petri dish. With a scalpel, make a straight cut from the posterior fontanel along the sagittal suture through the coronal suture and ending in the anterior fontanel to obtain two hemi-calvarias.\nPick up each of the hemi-calvarias with the fine-tipped tweezers and place them in a new Petri dish containing PBS.\n2. Calvaria culture\nAdd 1 mL of high-glucose DMEM medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (i.e., penicillin and streptomycin) in the wells of a 24 well plate. With fine-tip forceps, pick up each hemi-calvaria and place it in a well.\n\tNOTE: Put the hemi-calvarias concave side down.\nIncubate the hemi-calvarias for 24 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\nRemove the culture medium from each well and add 1 mL of fresh media containing the compound to test or conditioned media from other cells.\n\tNOTE: Use at least three hemi-calvarias for each treatment group and use negative and positive controls.\nIncubate the hemi-calvarias for 7 days, changing the media every 2-3 days.\n3. Culture with cancer cells",
    "Select a Petri dish with cancer cells at 80-90% confluence and trypsinize them. To trypsinize, wash the cancer cells 1x using PBS (5 mL per 75 cm2 flask) followed by incubation in an HBSS solution containing 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mM EDTA (2 mL per 75 cm2 flask).\nTransfer the cell suspension into a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 800 x g for 5 min at room temperature (RT).\nRemove and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 2 mL of DMEM containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic. Count live cells.\nAssign hemi-calvarias to each study group (i.e., the negative control and coculture group for RNA or histology analysis).\nRemove the culture media from the hemi-calvarias and add 1 mL of DMEM containing 2% FBS and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic supplemented or not supplemented with cancer cells.\n\tNOTE: The amount of cells to add can change depending on the cell line tested. With cancer cells like MDA-MB-231 or PC-3, 500,000 cells per well work appropriately.\nIncubate for 24 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Pass each hemi-calvaria to a new well to retain only cancer cells that adhered to the bone tissue.\nIncubate for 7 days at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and change the media every 2-3 days.\n4. Fixation\nCut squares of tissue paper to wrap the hemi-calvarias.\n\tNOTE: Biopsy foam pads or steel capsules for small biopsies can also be used.\nUse straight fine-tip forceps to pick up each hemi-calvaria from the sagittal suture, place on a tissue paper, and wrap.\nPlace the wrapped hemi-calvaria inside a labeled embedding cassette.\nPlace the cassette into a container with 10% phosphate-buffered formalin.\nFix for 24 h at 4 °C.\n5. Decalcification",
    "Remove the formalin, add 1x PBS, and agitate the tissues for 30 min to rinse the hemi-calvarias.\nRemove the PBS and add 10% EDTA (pH = 8, 0.34 M).\n\tNOTE: Verify that the solution covers the tissues completely.\nDecalcify the tissues for 48 h at 4 °C.\nDiscard the EDTA solution and add 1x PBS to rinse the tissue.\nStore the hemi-calvarias in 70% ethanol until the histology processing.\n6. Tissue processing\nDehydrate the tissues with rounds of 96% ethanol, 60 min (3x), followed by 100% ethanol, 60 min (3x).\nReplace the ethanol by 100% xylene, 60 min (3x).\nIncubate the cassettes in paraffin wax, 60 min (2x).\n7. Embedding\nOpen the cassettes, carefully remove the tissue paper, and unwrap the calvaria.\nPick up each calvaria carefully and stack all the hemi-calvarias from the same group in the same orientation.\nPut some paraffin in a mold.\nPick up all hemi-calvarias with the forceps and place them inside the mold with the sagittal suture down towards the base of the mold.\n\tNOTE: Orientation of the hemi-calvarias in the mold during inclusion is crucial to obtain consistent histological sections and reproducible results because this orientation will allow posterior identification of the front and parietal bones from the calvarias and the coronal suture facilitating the quantitative assessment.\nRelease the forceps and verify that the hemi-calvarias stay in place.\nPlace the labeled cassette on top of the mold and fill it with more paraffin to cover the hemi-calvarias.\nMove the molds to the cold surface.\n8. Sectioning\nTrim 500-600 µm of the sagittal suture with the microtome.\nCut 4 µm thick sections, and collect the sections needed.\nTrim another 300 µm.\nCut and collect another six 4 µm thick sections.\nTrim the block 300 µm further and collect more sections.",
    "Mount the sections onto glass microscope slides.\nDry the slides at RT.\n9. Staining\nImmerse the sections in 100% xylene for 3 min.\nSubmerge in 100% ethanol for 1 min.\nMerge in 96% ethanol for 1 min.\nImmerse in 80% ethanol for 1 min.\nSubmerge in 70% ethanol for 1 min.\nRinse in water for 3 min.\nSubmerge in hematoxylin for 3 min.\nRinse in water until the section is clear.\nSubmerge in a saturated lithium carbonate solution for 10 sec.\nRinse in water for 3 min.\nSubmerge in 96% ethanol for 1 min.\nSubmerge in eosin for 3 min.\nImmerse in 96% ethanol for 1 min.\nSubmerge in 100% ethanol for 1 min.\nSubmerge in 100% xylene for 3 min.\nAdd some per mount-mounting medium to the slide and protect it with a coverslip.\n\tNOTE: You can complement the hematoxyline and eosin (H&E) staining with tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining to evaluate osteoclast and osteolysis.\n10. Quantitative assessment: defining area for analysis\nExamine the sections under low power (i.e., 4x) to identify the orientation and the sutures.\nDefine the coronal suture and identify the long bone surface on one side and the short surface on the other.\nIdentify the coronal suture under 40x magnification, and move two or three optical fields away from the suture along the long surface. Capture images of this area for analysis.\nDefine the old bone area and the new bone area. The eosin Y with orange G stains the old bone darker and the new bone lighter.\nMeasure the total bone area of the old and new bone with Image J software using the color threshold tool. Express the results as µm2.\n11. Data analysis",
    "Analyze the results using statistical software. Significant differences between groups can be determined using appropriate tests (e.g., nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test as is done herel).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
