    "1. Collection of Zebrafish Embryos and Raising Larvae\nGlass Pyrex dishes with \"fake\" grass (made from green yarn) (Figure 1) should be inserted into the tanks at dawn and left in for two hours in order to collect zebrafish embryos. The glass dishes containing the embryos should be poured over a handheld strainer and rinsed with deionized water. The embryos should then be grown in egg water. The egg water contains 60 mg/L of Instant Ocean in deionized water and 0.25 mg/L of methylene blue, which is used as a mold inhibitor.\nDepending upon the hypothesis of the individual experiment, embryos can be treated immediately or during specific stages of development using toxicants or pharmaceuticals. The toxicants and pharmaceuticals are usually dissolved in DMSO (at a 1,000X concentration) and should be further diluted directly in the egg water medium.\nDuring embryonic and larval treatment with pharmaceuticals or toxicants, the larvae and embryos can be housed in deep Petri dishes at a density of about 50-60 larvae per 50 ml until the behavioral analyses at 7 dpf ( egg water solution should be changed at least every other day to avoid fungal/bacterial growth from dead embryos).\n2. Preparing Molds for Behavioral Analyses\nSpecially developed plastic molds which measure 11.7 cm x 7.6 cm x 5 mm were custom-built in-house. The molds are needed to create lanes using agarose which is poured into single well plastic plates from Thermo Scientific. The single well plates measure 12.4 cm x 8.1 cm x 1.2 cm.",
    "The molds contain five lanes in which the sides are angled at 60°. The lanes in the molds are 3.5 mm high with a base of 18 mm at the top which is the widest whereas the bottom width is 14 mm. There is a 4 mm gap between lanes in the mold (Figure 2).\nTo prepare the lanes pour 50 ml of melted agarose (0.8% agarose in deionized water with 60 mg/L Instant Ocean) in a single well plate. The mold should then be placed very slowly on top of the liquid agarose to eliminate any bubble formation and can be removed when the agarose has cooled (which takes roughly 45 min).\nThe agarose lanes should be made no earlier than one day before the behavioral experiment is to be run (to avoid the agarose drying out) The lanes can be stored at room temperature with the lids on the dishes for up to roughly 36 hr. The agarose lanes should only be used for one experiment and should then be discarded.\n3. Image Capture",
    "Up to 20 larvae can be placed in each lane of the plates. Typically 5 larvae per lane are used to facilitate the most accurate tracking of swim speed and to reduce the number of larvae that are needed per experiment. The lanes can be filled with egg water with or without pharmaceuticals or toxicants depending upon the experiment. However, lanes should not be filled up all the way until they are placed in the imaging cabinets; this will prevent overflow. For consistency, the larvae should have an acclimatization period of ten minutes after they are placed in the agarose molds and positioned on top of the laptop screen. Efficiently moving the larvae from the Petri dish to the agarose lane will help to reduce larvae stress. This is easiest when the larvae are housed in shallow tanks or Petri dishes.\nThe imaging cabinets include a Canon digital camera used for time-lapse photography and a laptop. The camera should be placed at the top of the cabinet and aimed towards to the bottom of the cabinet where a 15.6 inch screen laptop should be placed with screen facing up (Figure 3). Four plates should be positioned by hand directly on top of the laptop screen. At this time the lanes can be topped off with egg water or chemical treatment so that it is level with the top of the lane (to eliminate shadows on the edges of the lanes in the images).",
    "A PowerPoint presentation is used as an aversive stimulus for the larvae. In the past moving red balls were shown to zebrafish larvae in 6 or 12 multi-well plates 15,17,18. The current PowerPoint starts with a blank white background for 15 min, followed by 15 min of a moving red bar on the top half of the plate (Figure 4). In order to eliminate overheating the larvae, it is best to purchase a laptop with a screen temperature that does not go above 28 °C. To avoid evaporation of the liquid within the agarose lanes, the maximal imaging time should be kept to below one hour.\nThe digital camera should be programmed for time-lapse photography, taking pictures every 6 sec for a total of 300 images per experiment. However, the frequency and length can be adjusted depending on the experiment and behavioral quantification. In the past extended imaging times were employed using longer intervals between each image. The camera can be set at a lower resolution for imaging at video speed (30 frames per second). While the lower resolution limits the recordings to a single multiwell plate, the video recordings are appropriate for imaging rapid swimming events 15.\n4. Image Analysis\nThe images should be opened with ImageJ and used with a macro that was specifically written in-house. The macro automatically splits the color channels so that the red color can be removed, subtracts the background, applies a threshold, and identifies the larvae by particle analysis. The most current macro for five lane larval analysis is Zebrafish_macro25k. Use the prompts in the macro to set number of images, color to be subtracted, image threshold, etc.",
    "After all of the images are run through the ImageJ macro, a results file will be displayed and will contain x,y coordinates of the individual larvae for each image along with the image number and the lane number.\nThe results file should be saved in an Excel format and sorted based upon blank background vs. moving bar background and then the well number. An Excel template should be used that has equations built in that automatically determines placement of larvae in the wells, distance between larvae, speed of movement, and amount of rest. The most current Excel template is 25ib created in the Creton lab, which is available upon request. Graphs showing various treatment groups should be built into the Excel sheet along with t-tests for comparison between treatment groups and controls. Further statistical analysis can be performed using SPSS."
