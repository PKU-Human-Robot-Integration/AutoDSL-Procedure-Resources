    "This protocol describes two blocks (Figure 2), one specifies how to generate a reporter plasmids with a miRNA response element, while the second outlines data collection from FACS and processing in the R environment, the second block includes the gates used and a simplified code to generate analytical functions.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180829/20180829002250_7894.jpgFigure 2. Procedure scheme. Dual reporter plasmid is linearized with XhoI and NotI and ligated with annealed oligonucleotides. Proper oligonucleotides ligation eliminates one of two EcoRI restriction sites in the plasmid; hence positive clones are screened using endonuclease restriction. After the clones are sequenced and transfected, the fluorescence intensities are measured by Flow Cytometry, and the raw data is processed using the R programing language to generate analytical functions.Oligonucleotide designing and annealingHere, we describe how to make a p.UTA.2.0 plasmid with 1 microRNA-binding site, using miR-451a as an example.Note: We use here perfect miRNA complementarity, but endogenous 3’ UTR can be used.Design and order oligonucleotides as separate strands (Our oligonucleotides are ordered from Sigma-Aldrich) (Table 1).Table 1. Oligonucleotides design with XhoI and NotI imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180829/20180829004031_7015.jpgPrepare in 0.2 ml PCR tubes the following reaction to anneal the oligonucleotides (Table 2).Table 2. Oligonucleotides annealing and phosphorylation imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180829/20180829004111_8499.jpgIncubate at 37 °C for 1 h in a thermocycler, then cool it down in a ramp from 95 to 25 °C for 5 min (5 °C/min).Notes:Alternatively, you can heat up the oligonucleotides and let them cool down at room temperature for several hours. Normally phosphorylation is not necessary; however it is required if the plasmid is dephosphorylated. You can check if the oligonucleotides are annealed through running a 2% agarose gel using the individual oligonucleotides as controls. Normally we skip this step and have no issues with the ligation afterward. Store the annealed oligonucleotides at -20 °C or proceed to the ligation step.p.UTA.2.",
    "0 plasmid LinearizationPrepare the digestion in a 1.5 ml microfuge tube (Table 3). Scale up accordingly for multiple reactions.Table 3. Digestion of the plasmid p.UTA.2.0 Empty imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180829/20180829004144_5383.jpgAlthough not required, we recommend making NotI and XhoI separated controls.Usually dephosphorylation is not necessary; however, it reduces the background after ligation (see below), in that case, the annealed oligonucleotides need to be phosphorylated.Vortex briefly to mix.Spin the tube quickly to collect the liquid at the bottom.Incubate the mixture at 37 °C for at least 1 h. Note: Overnight incubation is possible. Run the reactions in a 1% agarose gel.Cut the 5,131 bp band and transfer the piece to a clean microcentrifuge tube.Extract the DNA from the gel using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit following the manufacturer’s protocol.Measure DNA concentration.Prepare 50 ng/μl aliquots of the linearized plasmid.Ligation of p.UTA.2.0 and annealed oligo-duplexPrepare ligation in a 1.5 ml microfuge tube according to Table 4. Scale up accordingly for multiple reactions. Table 4.

Transform into your favorite competent cells.Screening of positive clonesNotes:To check for the correct oligonucleotide insertion, we performed endonuclease restriction to distinguish empty clones (w/o miRNA response element) from the positive ones. Since the insertion site (XhoI and NotI) contains an EcoRI site that disappears after digestion, this holds true if the oligonucleotides lack EcoRI sequence. We used HindIII and EcoRI together: the empty vector yields four bands (3,992; 1,010; 732; 111) and the positive clones three (3,292; 1,736; 111).",
    "Since our plasmid lacks a stuffer sequence, we can differentiate background from partially digested DNA; for that reason, we highly recommend performing this screening test (Figure 3). Sequences can be retrieved from Addgene Page (http://www.addgene.org/82446/[href=http://www.addgene.org/82446/]).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180829/20180829002315_7574.jpgFigure 3. Plasmid scheme and restriction sites. Screening of positive clones using HindIII and EcoRI restriction sites. Notice the EcoRI site between the XhoI and NotI that differentiates between inserted oligos and re-ligation background.Grow your bacteria cultures and isolate plasmid using QIAprep Spin Miniprep.Note: It’s also ok to use home-made solutions to isolate plasmids. Prepare the digestion reaction in a 1.5 ml microfuge tube (Table 5). Scale up accordingly when performing multiple reactions.Table 5.

Agarose DNA gel electrophoresis from screening reactions, it shows one positive clone (lane 2) and three empty vectors without insert (lanes 4, 6, 8). Non-digested controls (lanes 1, 3, 5, 7).Transfection of the p.UTA.2.0 plasmidsThis transfection scheme is optimized for 24-well plates using Hek293 cells; we have evaluated this protocol in HeLa, HTC116, and SH-SY5Y. It showed that the neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y) is not suitable for this assay because the promoters are not strong enough to produce proper analytical functions.Seed HEK293 cells (about 100,000 cell per well) in a 24-well plate.Incubate for 18-24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2.",
    "Prepare DNA samples as follows (we recommend at least triplicates per experimental unit. Scale up accordingly):imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180829/20180829004434_3423.jpgPrepare Lipofectamine® 2000 reagent as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180829/20180829004513_2260.jpgAdd the DNA solution (Step E3) to Lipofectamine® 2000 reagent (Step for E4) in a 1:1 ratio.Incubate the mixture for at least 20 min at room temperature.Add the DNA-lipofectamine mixture dropwise to the cells.Incubate for 72 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Sample preparation for flow cytometryDiscard medium from the well.Wash 1 time with PBS (~500 μl).Add 100 μl trypsin per well.Incubate for 5 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Add 400 μl DMEM medium + 15% FCS.Transfer the cell suspension to a FACS-tube.Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min.Discard the supernatant.Add 1 ml PBS.Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min.Repeat Steps F9 and F10 two more times.Discard the supernatant.Spin down briefly.Note: Cells can be documented at this point without fixing.
