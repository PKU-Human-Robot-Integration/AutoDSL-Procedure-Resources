    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPrepare reagents\nTiming: 30 min\nThis step prepares the buffers and reagents, which are made on the morning of the experiment.\nAlternatives: Any left over buffers can be re-used for a later experiment, as long as they are stored as stated below.\nMake 10 mL DMEM/F12 medium with 10% FBS working under sterile conditions in a flow bench:\nThaw FBS in a waterbath\nAdd 1 mL FBS to 9 mL DMEM/F12 medium in a sterile 15 mL tube and gently mix by inverting the tube\nStore at 4°C and use within one week\nMake 10 mL 0.0125% Trypsin-EDTA:\nThaw one vial of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA at 20°C–22°C\nAdd 0.5 mL 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA to 9.5 mL PBS w EDTA in a 15 mL tube\nStore at 4°C and use within one week\nMake 1 L 10% FBS in PBS (henceforth FBS/PBS):\nThaw 3 vials of FBS in a waterbath\nAdd 100 mL of FBS to 900 mL of sterile PBS\nStore at 4°C and use within two weeks\nMake 500 mL of 10% FBS in PBS with 0.5% Tween-20:\nTake 497.5 mL FBS/PBS from step 3 and add 2.5 mL Tween-20\nStore at 4°C and use within two weeks\nPause Point: Maximum of one week. As these buffers and reagents can be stored for one to two weeks, it is possible to prepare them slightly in advance, for instance the previous day.\nThaw one vial of 2% formaldehyde (100 μL needed per sample) and store on wet ice for use in fixation (step 17).\nDissect embryonic tissue for analysis\nTiming: 1–3 h depending on number of plugged female mice\nIn this step, embryonic tissue is dissected for the analysis.",
    "Alternatives: The protocol was optimized for embryonic pancreas, but can be used for other embryonic inner organs (lungs, liver, thyroid, etc).\nNote: The timing depends on the number of embryos dissected and the experience of the researcher. One pregnant mouse with 10 embryos routinely takes us 40 min to dissect, and should take no longer than 1 h to prevent cell death. See Problem 3: High cell death. To allow time for the rest of the experiment, the total time for dissection should not exceed 3 h. In our experience, we can process maximum 3 pregnant mice per experiment. If possible, work 2 persons on this part of the protocol to ensure a steady pace.\nPrepare a stereoscope laboratory station with wet-ice bucket, two dissection forceps and ice-cold sterile 1× PBS\nPrepare 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes with 500 μL DMEM medium in each and place on wet ice\nEuthanize the pregnant female by cervical dislocation\nIsolate your organ of interest from embryos\nDissect the uterus containing the embryos from the pregnant female\nMove embryos to ice-cold sterile 1× PBS in a Petri dish stored on wet ice\nDissect the embryos one by one from the uterus and move embryos to a small clean Petri dish containing ice-cold sterile 1× PBS\nAssign embryos ID numbers starting from 1\nNote: The sex of the embryos were not determined\nOptional: Check for fluorescence: If using fluorescent reporter mice, the expression of fluorescence can be checked under a stereoscope equipped for fluorescence imaging. Any non-fluorescent embryos should be used for control samples (see Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]). Note down the ID number of fluorescent positive and negative embryos\nUnder a stereoscope, dissect your organ of interest from the embryos using two #1 Dumont forceps\nAlternatives: Other fine forceps or needles can also be used for dissection",
    "Dissect the four paws from each embryo\nOptional: Save tissue for genotyping: When using a reporter mouse, one paw from each embryo can be transferred to a PCR tube on wet ice for later verification of genotype by PCR (not included in this protocol)\nMove the organ of interest and one paw (E14.5) or all remaining paws (E11.5) from the same embryo into ice-cold 500 μL DMEM in Eppendorf tubes on wet ice.\nCritical: Make sure your organs of interest are all dissected in a similar manner, taking care not to include any nearby tissue, which could greatly affect your sample.\nCritical: The “spiking” of the sample with paw tissue minimizes loss of cells of interest during the processing steps, enabling the analysis of very small tissue samples. The paws are used for spiking, as they did not express any of our antigens of interest. Always check that this is also the case for your choice of antigens, and adjust the protocol accordingly to include an alternative spiking tissue. For our smallest (E11.5) samples we added additional spiking cells from paws (up to a total of 6) of any surplus embryos with a genotype we did not need to analyse.\nPreparation of cell suspension\nTiming: 1 h, 40 min\nThis step disaggregates the tissues and prepares a single cell suspension ready for immunofluorescent staining. The digestion step is performed essentially as describe in (Jørgensen et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nDigest tissue with Liberase TM\nTo sample in DMEM, add 1.25 μL Liberase TM (22.6 mg/mL)\nAdd 4 μL DNAse I (10U/μL)\nIncubate at 37°C, 20 min, at 950 rpm (rounds per minute) on a thermomixer.\nCritical: Triturate gently every 3–4 min using a P1000 pipette. Make sure you change tips between samples",
    "Centrifuge tubes at 500 g for 4 min at 4°C and carefully aspirate and discard the supernatant (Henceforth: Spin).\nDigest tissue with Trypsin\nResuspend in 100 μL of 0.0125% Trypsin-EDTA with 4 μL DNAse I (10U/ μL) added\nIncubate 37°C for 10 min, at 950 rpm on thermomixer\nCritical: Triturate gently every 3–4 min using a P1000 pipette. Make sure you change tips between samples\nCheck that tissue has completely disintegrated\nSpin\nResuspend pellet with 1000 μL ice-cold 10% FBS in DMEM to inactivate the trypsin\nFilter the cells into Eppendorf tubes using single-use cell strainers to make a single cell suspension. Wash the strainer with 500 μL FBS/PBS into tube.\nCritical: It is important that all tissue be digested during this step. Incomplete digestion of tissue in step 12) will result in visible clumps of cells or tissue and will greatly affect downstream processing. See Problem 1: Incomplete digestion.\nImmunofluorescent staining of cells\nTiming: 3 h, 30 min\nThis step labels the cells using immunofluorescent staining for dead cells and for extracellular and intracellular antigens. Staining of dead cells is performed first, followed by extracellular staining, then cell fixation and finally intracellular staining. Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4] shows an overview of the exemplary staining protocol.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_760_4.csv\nCritical: It is important that care is taken not to lose cells during the washing steps (spin, remove supernatant, resuspend). See Problem 2: Low cell yields.\nCritical: Keep all reagents on wet-ice. See also Problem 3: High cell death",
    "Note: Blocking: 10% FBS is included in all steps below, except Ghostdye staining and fixation, to block unspecific protein binding during staining and keep cells dissociated and alive (before fixation). There is no Fc receptor blocking step, because we analyse cells from embryonic internal organs, which do not to our knowledge contain Fc receptors. For users who wish to test our protocol on cell types which do express Fc receptors (mainly immune system cells), such a step should be included (Hulspas et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). See also Problem 5: High noise/background\nNote: Controls: See Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] for an overview of controls used in our exemplary experiment. These are the absolute minimum of controls needed for a multicolor labeling experiment. For a discussion of other types of recomended controls see (Hulspas et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Maecker and Trotter, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). Isotype controls are sometimes also used to detect unspecific binding of antibody. These are antibodies of the same isotype of immunoglobulin as the specific antibody, but are either myeloma derived antibodies of unknown specificity, or are raised against an antigen that is not epressed by the cells. We did not use isotype controls, for the reasons described by (Hulspas et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Maecker and Trotter, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) and discussed in Problem 5: High noise/background.\nStain with Ghostdye for detection of dead cells\nSpin\nRemove supernatant and resuspend in 1000 μL pure sterile PBS.\nNote: FBS is removed by washing with pure sterile PBS before staining with Ghost dye to optimize the staining efficiency as FBS will react with and bind up some proportion of the Ghost dye. If your cells do no tolerate a FBS-free environment, a low concentration of FBS can be used, but the concentration of the Ghost dye should be optimized accordingly in the same concentration of FBS.\nSpin",
    "Resuspend in 1000 μL pure sterile PBS\nSpin Ghostdye only control and samples. The remaining controls which are not stained with Ghostdye (see Tables 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]) are set aside (in PBS) on wet ice during steps e-i\nMeanwhile prepare 100 μL of dPBS with 1:1000 dilution of Ghost dye (Ghost dye Red-780) per sample.\nResuspend cells in Ghost dye solution\nMix immediately\nIncubate 30 min at 4°C (in cold room or refrigerator) protected from light\nSpin all samples and controls\nResuspend in 1000 μL FBS/PBS\nSpin\nResuspend in 1000 μL FBS/PBS\nStain with primary antibody for extracellular antigen\nSet aside controls which do not require staining with primary antibody for extracellular antigen (see Tables 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]) in FBS/PBS on wet ice\nPrepare enough primary antibody dilution to stain all your samples, allowing 100 μL per sample. Note that extra diluted antibody should be made to account for pipetting error (at least 10% extra volume). Prepare primary antibody dilution in FBS/PBS. For CD-133-APC we dilute 1:100: For a total of 1 mL (enough for 9 samples) add 10 μL antibody in 990 μL FBS/PBS and mix gently. For alternative antibody panels the optimal dilution factor needs to be determined by end user (see first step in the “before you begin” section).\nSpin samples and controls requiring staining with primary antibody for extracellular antigen (see Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3])\nResuspend cells in 100 uL diluted primary antibody per sample\nIncubate for 30 min rotating at 4°C protected from light. Use a 3D gentle rotator/shaker placed at 4°C and cover tubes in foil.\nAdd 1000 μL ice-cold 10% FBS/PBS\nSpin all samples and controls (including controls set aside in step 16a)\nResuspend in 1000 μL ice-cold pure sterile PBS (to remove FBS before fixation)\nFixation",
    "Note: All samples and controls should be included in the fixation step\nSpin\nResuspend in 100 μL 2% PFA (freshly thawed) and leave tubes at 20°C–22°C for 15 min protected from light.\nAdd 1000 μL ice-cold pure sterile PBS\nSpin\nResuspend in 1000 μL ice-cold FBS/PBS\nStain with primary antibody for intracellular antigen\nSpin all samples and controls\nMeanwhile prepare enough primary antibody dilution to stain all your samples. Prepare in 100 μL FBS/PBS with 0,5% Tween20 per sample. For mouse-anti-P120CTN we use a 1:1000 dilution: For a total of 1 mL (enough for 9 samples) add 1 μL antibody in 999 μL FBS/PBS with 0,5% Tween20 and mix gently. For alternative antibody panels the optimal dilution factor needs to be determined by end user.\nResuspend cells from samples and controls requiring primary antibody for intracellular antigen (see Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]) in 100 uL diluted primary antibody per sample. All other controls are resuspended in 100 μL FBS/PBS with 0,5% Tween20.\nIncubate for 30 min rotating at 4°C protected from light.

Prepare in 100 μL FBS/PBS per sample. For the Cy3 Goat Anti-Mouse secondary antibody we use a 1:1000 dilution: For a total of 1 mL (enough for 9 samples) add 1 μL antibody in 999 μL FBS/PBS with 0,5% Tween20 and mix gently. For alternative antibody panels the optimal dilution factor needs to be determined by end user.",
    "Resuspend cells from samples and controls requiring secondary antibody for intracellular antigen (see Tables 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]) in 100 μL of diluted secondary antibody per sample. All other controls are resuspended in 100 μL FBS/PBS with 0,5% Tween20. Incubate for 10 min rotating at 4°C protected from light.

See Problem 4: Low fluorescence\nFlow cytometry analysis of cells\nTiming: 1–3 h depending on number of samples and cells\nIn this step, the cells are gated based on their light-scattering properties and fluorescent intensities from endogenous fluorescence (reporter) and from immunofluorescent staining, followed by analysis and optional sorting.\nNote: In the following, we will outline the gating strategy, but exclude any technical information about operating the equipment as this is highly instrument specific and should be done according to the manufactures instruction for the particular instrument.\nNote: Optimally, the preparation and calibration of the flow cytometer as described in step 21 below should be done during the staining procedure described above, so the stained cells can be analyzed immediately.\nCritical: Performing compensation to correct for fluorescent spectra overlap is critical when using multiple fluorphores, especially if they have overlapping emission spectra, as for instance CFP and GFP used in the exemplary data (Maecker and Trotter, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). The need for compensation could also be dependent on cytometer configuration. We used the single fluorphore/fluorescent protein controls described in Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] to perform compensation in step 22",
    "Prepare and calibrate the flow cytometer according to manufacturer’s instructions\nStartup system and select appropriate laser lines and filters\nPerform fluidics start-up and de-bubbling\nCalibrate laser delays\nIf sorting, calibrate drop delay and side streams\nSetup experiment or load previous settings\nYou will need plots of side scatter (SSC-A) versus forward scatter (FSC-A), FSC-H versus FSC-W, Ghost dye versus FSC-A, and your chosen fluorophores versus each other (reporter or immunostaining based). See examples in Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].\nAdjust and save gains and voltages as appropriate for the cytometer and fluorophore panel\nAcquire and save single fluorophore/fluorescent protein controls for compensation to correct for spectra overlap\nUse single fluorphore/fluorescent protein controls (examples described in Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]) to perform compensation according to manufactures’ instructions (automatic or manual).\nSet gates for your fluorophores based on the controls (see Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] for examples)\nUse the no fluorophore control to set gate 1 on the FSC-A vs SSC-A plot (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) to remove debris\nUse the no fluorophore control to set gate 2 on the FSC-W vs FSC-H (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B) to remove doublets\nUse the Ghost dye only control to set gate 3 and remove dead cells (See result of this gating on a stained sample in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C)\nUse the no fluorophore control, the secondary antibody only control and the single fluorophore/fluorescent protein controls to set gate 4 (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D and result of this gating on a stained sample in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D)\nThe no fluorophore control should have no positive cells in gate 4\nThe secondary antibody only control should have no positive cells in gate 4\nThe Cy3 only, APC only, CFP only and GFP only controls should reflect their relative genotypes or staining",
    "Note: FMO controls (controls that include all fluorophores except one) were not included in the exemplary experiment, but could be useful for gating in a first pilot study with a new antibody panel. See (Maecker and Trotter, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) for more details.\nOptional: If you wish to sort your cells, this needs to be set up with sorting gates (see example in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] where red and blue cells are sorted into two fractions based on bimodal distribution of P120CTN expression).\nRecord (and optionally sort) the samples one at a time. Record all the events in each sample."
