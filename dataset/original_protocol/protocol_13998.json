    "All methods described here have been approved by the ethics committee of the Beijing Hospital. Indications and contraindications for surgery are according to the European Association of Urology guidelines for upper urinary tract urothelial cell carcinoma.\n1. Instruments for Operation\nEnsure the availability of the laparoscopic imaging system, images of the pneumoperitoneum, and ultrasonic scalpel.\n2. Preparation for Operation\nPrepare the patient with a bowel cleansing before the operation. Have the anesthesiologist perform an anesthesia risk assessment of the patient prior to surgery. Have patients taking aspirin before surgery stop taking it.\nPrepare the skin around the surgical site.\nPreoperatively administer an intravenous antibiotic 30 min before the operation to all patients. Use cefuroxime sodium 1.5 g with 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution.\nBefore administering general anesthesia, lay the patient down on the operating table.\nAfter general anesthesia, place the healthy side of the patient in a 60° recline at the waist, so the patient is in a V-shaped position on the operating table.\n3. Procedure\nPlace trocars (see Figure 1).\n\t\nBegin the operation with the patient in the right lateral position.\nEstablish pneumoperitoneum by inserting a pneumoperitoneal needle using the Veress method. Maintain the pneumoperitoneum pressure at 14 mmHg.\nImplant a trocar at the umbilical level near the outer edge of the left rectus abdominis muscle. Then, insert the laparoscope.\nPlace the other trocars.\nTreat the kidney and upper and middle ureters.\n\t\nRotate the operating bed axially so that the patient is in an ~80°–90° lateral position.\nNOTE: This position allows for the intestines to fall to the side, which better exposes the renal hilum for treatment.\nDissect the peritoneum on the affected side and fully release the colon downwards.",
    "Free and clamp the ureter at the distal end of the tumor with a vascular closure clip and then dislodge upwards along the ureter until reaching the renal hilum level.\nTreat the renal artery and renal vein successively and completely free the kidney.\nFree the ureter to the external vascular level.\nTreat the terminal ureter.\n\t\nRotate the operating bed axially so that the patient is in a 50° lateral position.\nNOTE: This position is optimal for surgery inside the pelvic area and avoids having the surgeon operate in a position that is too low.\nOpen the anterior peritoneum of the ureter with an ultrasonic scalpel and after crossing the iliac vessels, identify the umbilical medial iliac crest, where the umbilical artery is located6 (Figure 2).\nCut the medial iliac crest so that the artery can reach the outside of the bladder (Figure 3).\nClamp and cut the distal end of the vascular structure as is the norm. Free the bladder until the ureter enters the bladder.\nCut the entire layer of the bladder wall at the upper side of the ureteral junction. Suture the full layer of the bladder with 3-0 absorbable thread to indicate and provide traction to see the normal bladder mucosa5,7.\nRemove the ureteral bladder wall segment and part of the bladder mucosa with a scalpel. While making the incision, completely suture the bladder wall with absorbable lines (Figure 4).\nTake out the specimen.\n\t\nLoad the surgical specimen into the specimen bag.\nAccording to the conditions, extend the incision for cannula A and take out the specimen.\nLayer off each incision.\nPostoperative care.\n\t\nLet the patient lay in bed for approximately 1 h postoperatively in the care unit until he or she completely wakes up from anesthesia.",
    "Meanwhile, monitor the patient and ensure that oxygen is available during this time.\nWhen the patient completely wakes up, return the patient to the ward. Pay attention to the color and volume of the urine and abdominal drainage. Pay attention to the presence of any abdominal signs and symptoms (e.g., stomachache and peritoneal irritation).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
