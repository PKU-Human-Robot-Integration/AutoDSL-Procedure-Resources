    "All animal experiments protocols were approved by the Illinois Institute of Technology Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol 2015-001, Approval date: 3 November 2015) and followed the NIH \"Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\"9.\n1. Pre-experiment Preparation\nPrepare 500 mL of Ringer’s solution (contains: 145 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.0 mM MgSO4, 1.0 mM CaCl2, 10.0 mM HEPES, 11 mM glucose, pH 7.4) freshly for each day of the experiment.\nFill 200 mL of Ringer's solution in a spray bottle and store at 4 °C fridge. Fill a Petri dish (10 cm in diameter) with Ringer's solution and perfuse with 100% oxygen by connecting the tube from an oxygen cylinder to an aquarium air stone. The Petri dishes (\"dissecting dishes\") were previously coated with an elastomer compound to allow inserting pins during the dissection.\nPrepare metal mounting hooks. Cut two pieces of stainless-steel wire, 0.5 mm in diameter, to the appropriate length and bend the wire at both ends to form hooks. Arrange all the dissecting tools, scissors, suture tying forceps, micro-scissors handy for use.\nNOTE: The hook part should be about 3 mm long. The longer wire (ending in a hook) should be about 5 cm long, and the shorter wire (also ending in a hook) should be about 1 cm long in order to fit the custom chambers used at BioCAT and allow for a sufficient range of motion for the transducer arm. \nConnect and turn on all the equipment. This includes a combined motor/force transducer, motor/force transducer controller a high-power bi-phasic current stimulator, and a computer controlled data acquisition/control system.",
    "Turn on the data acquisition system and calibrate it before beginning the experiment10. Briefly, calibrating the force by adding a set of known weights, covering up to 50% of the maximum force measured by the force transducer in a linear progression, on the force transducer and recording the output voltage changes. Calibrate the length by applying a set of known output voltage to the lever arm and measure the length change of the arm.\nConnect the hoses from the thermal block on the sample holder to a refrigerated circulating bath and set the temperature to maintain the desired temperature in the chamber to between 10 °C and 40 °C. Determine this empirically ahead of time by setting the circulating bath to a range of temperatures and measuring the temperature in the chamber with a thermocouple.\n2. Muscle Preparation\nEuthanizing the mouse\nEuthanize the mouse by carbon dioxide inhalation followed by cervical dislocation.\nSpray the skin on the hind limb with cold Ringer’s solution to prevent hair from blowing into the preparation. Remove the skin by cutting it away around the thigh using fine dissection scissors and quickly pull the skin down using #5 forceps to expose the muscles.\nAmputate the hind limb and transfer it to a dissecting dish that has been filled with oxygenized Ringer’s solution, and then place under a binocular dissecting microscope.\nPreparing a soleus muscle\nPin the hind limb down in the dissecting dish with the gastrocnemius muscle facing upwards. Cut the distal tendon of the gastrocnemius/soleus muscle group and lift the muscles gently and slowly by cutting away the fascia on either side of the gastrocnemius muscle using fine scissors. Isolate the gastrocnemius/soleus muscle group from the limb after freeing the proximal tendon of the soleus muscle.",
    "Pin the muscle group containing the gastrocnemius muscle and the distal tendon down in the dissecting dish. Lift the soleus muscle gently via the proximal tendon and separate it from the gastrocnemius muscle leaving as much of the soleus distal tendon intact as possible.\nPreparing an extensor digitorium longus (EDL) muscle\nPin the hind limb down in the dissecting dish with the tibialis anterior muscle facing upwards. Cut the fascia along the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle and pull it clear using forceps. Identify and cut the distal tendon of the TA muscle. Lift the TA muscle and cut it out carefully without pulling on the EDL muscle.\nCut open the lateral side of the knee and expose the two tendons. Cut the proximal tendon, leaving as much of the tendon as possible still attached to the muscle, and lift the EDL muscle (medial muscle) by gently pulling the tendon. Cut the distal tendon once it is exposed.\nMounting the muscle\nPin down the muscle via the tendons, and trim all the extra fat, fascia and tendon away as much as possible. Insert one tendon into a pre-tied knot and tie the suture tightly with suture tying forceps. Tie the second knot on around the metal hook.\nRepeat the same procedure with the long hook on the other end of the tendon. Make sure that none of the body of the muscle is contacted by the sutures. This will damage the preparation.\nAttach the short hook to the bottom of the experimental chamber and the long hook to the dual mode force transducer/motor. Bubble the solution in the experimental chamber with 100% oxygen.\nOptimizing stimulation protocols and muscle length",
    "Stretch the muscle by adjusting the micromanipulators attached to the transducer/motor to generate a baseline tension between 15 to 20 mN before finding the best stimulus parameters. Set the stimulation voltage to 40 V. The stimulation current is systematically increased until there is no additional increase in twitch force. The highest current found is increased by about 50% to ensure supra-maximal activation.\nFind the optimal length, L0, defined as the muscle length that give maximum twitch force, by increasing the muscle length and activating the muscle with a single twitch until the active force (peak force minus baseline force) stops increasing.\nPerform a short tetanic contraction (1 s activation) to test the mounting and stretch the muscle back to optimal baseline force if necessary. Record the muscle length in mm with a digital caliper.\n3. X-ray Diffraction\nNOTE: The following description is for X-ray diffraction experiments done using the small angle X-ray diffraction instrument on the BioCAT beamline 18ID at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory but similar methods could be employed on other beamlines such as ID 02 at the ESRF (France) and BL40XU at SPring8 (Japan). Beamline 18ID is operated at a fixed X-ray beam energy of 12 keV (0.1033 nm wavelength) with an incident flux of ~1013 photons per second in the full beam.\nChoose a specimen to detector distance (camera length). Use a 1.8 m camera length for experiments examining the 2.7 nm actin and high order myosin reflections such as 2.8 nm meridional reflections. Use a 4-6 m camera for other experiments, where one is primarily interested in fine detail on the meridian and layer lines\nOptimizing the position of the sample in beam",
    "Determine the beam position by using a piece of X-ray sensitive paper that produces a dark spot in response to X-rays (\"a burn\"). Then use a video cross-hair generator to create a cross-hair aligned with the burn mark on the paper or simply make a mark on the video screen with a marker pen.\nUse the BioCAT supplied graphical user interface to the sample positioner to move the muscle to be centered on the beam position. Oscillate the sample chamber at ~10-20 mm/s by moving the sample stage in order to spread the X-ray dose over the muscle during the exposure. Observe the sample as it moves to avoid large regions of fascia (contains collagen which will pollute the diffraction patterns) and to ensure that it stays illuminated during the entire path of its travel.\nNOTE: The exact steps required in sections 3.3 and 3.4 to make the required settings and actions using the beamline-supplied graphical user interface will be beamline and detector specific. Ask beamline staff as to how to perform these operations.\nSetting up the CCD (charge coupled device) detector for high resolution patterns from muscle in defined static states (resting, or during isometric contraction)\nSet up the exposure time and exposure period in the graphical user interface to the control software. Take a dark background image before taking the exposure and repeat this procedure every 2 hours or after changing of exposure time to correct any drift in the detector readout electronics.\nAttenuate the X-ray beam to desired value for the exposure. Then take an image. It is not possible to take sequences of images with this detector. The CCD detector also needs several seconds to read out an individual image.\nSetting up the pixel array detector for a time resolved experiment",
    "Set up the number of images, exposure time, exposure period in the graphical user interface. The pixel array detector used here needs at least 1 ms to readout. The maximum frame frequency for photon counting detector is 500 Hz. Use the photon counting detector output signal to control the X-ray shutter.\nAttenuate the beam to the desired intensity. Arm the detector and wait for the trigger from the data acquisition system. Synchronize the mechanical and X-ray data by triggering them at the same time. The X-ray patterns are collected continuously throughout the protocol a with a 1 ms exposure time and a 2 ms exposure period.\nNOTE: The exact exposure time and exposure period should be determined on a case by case basis for the information desired and the observed lifetime of the sample in the beam. Attenuate the beam in order to use no more X-ray beam than is needed to provide analyzable data in the chosen exposure period.\n4. Post-experiment Muscle Treatment\nRecover and weigh the muscle after each mechanical and X-ray experiment. Calculate the cross-sectional area of the muscle using the measured muscle length and the muscle mass11 assuming a muscle density of 1.06 g/mL12.\nStretch the muscle to the experimental length and fix the muscle in 10% formalin for 10 min. Separate the fixed muscle into a series of fiber bundles selected from locations throughout the entire muscle cross section3.\nMeasure the sarcomere length using a video sarcomere length measuring system."
