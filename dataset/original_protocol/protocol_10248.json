    "1. Cell Culture and Sample Preparation\nObtain an appropriate cell line (e.g., dermal papilla cells).\n\tNOTE: The current protocol has been designed for adherent cells, with rat dermal papilla fibroblasts isolated from vibrissae used as a model.\nCulture the cells in a T-75 flask containing minimum essential medium (MEM) α supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin streptomycin. Keep the cells at standard culture conditions of 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified environment until they reach 80% confluence.\nAspirate the medium and wash the cells twice in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Dissociate the cells from the flask by incubating them in 2 mL of trypsin/EDTA at standard culture conditions for 5 min. Briefly check to ensure that cells have successfully dissociated from the flask using a light/phase contrast microscope (with a 10X objective lens).\nAdd 4 mL of culture medium to neutralize the trypsinization reaction. Transfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge at 200 x g for 4 min to pellet the cells.Slowly aspirate the supernatant, taking care not to dislodge the pellet.Re-suspend the pellet in 5 mL of medium.\nTransfer a 20 µL aliquot of the cell suspension to a clean hemocytometer and count the cells using a microscope fitted with a 10X objective lens.\nPrepare the cells for the blast by placing three 35 mm dishes inside a 90 mm dish. Label them appropriately. Add 2 mL of medium to each 35 mm dish and seed a total of 5 x 104 cells per dish, distributing the cells evenly around the dish. Incubate the experimental samples overnight in standard culture conditions to allow for adequate cell attachment before shock wave exposure.\n\tNOTE: For fluorescent imaging, cells must be seeded onto sterile glass coverslips.\n2. Shock Tube Assembly\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55618/55618fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2: EVOC Rig and Shock Tube Assembly. (A) Image of the EVOC rig. (B) Schematic of the shock tube apparatus. Shock tube dimensions include an internal diameter of 59 mm and a total length, including the EVOC rig, of 4.13 m. The length of the driven tube and the EVOC rig totals 2.71 m. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=http://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55618/55618fig2large.jpg]\nWear steel-toe work boots and a laboratory coat during the assembly procedures.\nInsert the two alignment bars through the two bolt holes found in the horizontal plane of the outlet flange. Place a nitrile-rubber gasket sheet over the end of the alignment bars so that it sits between the outlet flange and the ex vivo organ culture (EVOC) rig.\n\tNOTE: The EVOC rig is a custom-designed fixture intended for use with 35 mm Petri dishes (Figure 2A).\nAttach the EVOC rig to the outlet flange of the shock tube by sliding the fixture over the alignment bars, ensuring that it is orientated correctly so that the section that holds the petri dish is located at its base.\nInsert four M24 bolts and washers into the remaining holes. Position the nuts so that they touch the flange.\nTightly fasten the nuts and bolts sequentially in a diagonally symmetric fashion whilst visually checking that the EVOC rig and shock tube have successfully aligned.\nAttach a pressure transducer to the EVOC rig and connect it to the current source using a sensor cable. Then, using a BNC cable, connect the current source to the oscilloscope.\nEnsure that all release valves and flow controls on the shock tube are closed. Open the built-in external compressed air line and manually turn the pressure regulator clockwise to charge the solenoid to 2.5 bar.",
    "Open the safety valve on the compressed gas bottle by turning it anticlockwise 180°.\nSlowly turn the pressure regulator, located on top of the gas bottle, clockwise to increase the pressure to approximately 15 bar.\n\tNOTE: The setting point of this regulator should be slightly above the highest bursting pressure of the thickest diaphragm that is to be used in the experiment.\nPrepare the diaphragms by cutting a 0.125 mm-thick plastic sheet into 10 cm x 10 cm squares.\n\tNOTE: The thickness of the diaphragm will correlate with the bursting pressure, altering the peak pressure of the shock wave (i.e., a thicker diaphragm will result in a shock wave with a larger peak pressure; Table 1).\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\nMylar Diaphragm dimensions (cm),Burst pressure (bar),Sensor 3 pressure range (kPa)\n10 x 10 x 0.023,2 ± 0.2,47 ± 7.5\n10 x 10 x 0.050,4 ± 0.2,72 ± 7.5\n10 x 10 x 0.125,9.5 ± 0.5,127 ± 12.5\nTable 1: Burst Pressure Corresponding to Diaphragm Thickness and Peak Pressure.\nCreate handles out of tape, fix them to the top and bottom of the diaphragm, and use them to carefully position the diaphragm next to the front small flange by the breech chamber. Ensure that the diaphragm is straight and correctly positioned before closing the breech.\nSecure this using four M24 bolts and nuts. Tightly fasten the nuts and bolts sequentially in a diagonally symmetric fashion.\n3. Preparation of Cells Just Prior to Shock Wave Exposure\nPrepare a tissue laminar flow hood by performing ultraviolet sterilization. Clean it with a disinfectant solution and 70% ethanol. Gather all items needed for handling cells prior to/post-shock wave exposure and place them within the sterile hood.\n\tNOTE: This includes fresh medium, adhesive gas-permeable membranes, sterile scissors, pipettes, and pipette tips.",
    "Transfer one 90 mm Petri dish containing three experimental samples from the incubator to the sterile hood.\nCut an adhesive gas-permeable membrane sheet (see the Table of Materials) into six squares, such that each is large enough to cover the top of one 35 mm Petri dish.\nAspirate the medium from the 35 mm Petri dish, place the lid to one side, and cover with two adhesive gas-permeable membranes sections, ensuring that there is a tight seal between the membrane and the edge of the dish.\nTransfer the sample to the EVOC rig and secure it to the base of the fixture so that the top of the dish is aligned with the inner base of the shock tube.\n4. Shock Tube Operation\nWear ear defenders, eye goggles, safety boots, and a laboratory coat when pressurizing the shock tube system.\nTurn the flow control knob on the regulator clockwise, allowing gas to flow into the flexible hose connecting the compressed air cylinder to the shock tube.\nAt the bottom of the control panel, select either the \"Double Breech\" inlet for a short-duration shock wave or the \"Driver Tube\" inlet for an increased wave duration.\nSwitch on the DC power source and oscilloscope to acquire the waveform data. Set the oscilloscope sampling rate to 50.0 MS/s, with a record length of 1 M points. Set a range of 50 mV for firing at 2 bar and 100 mV for above 4 bar.\nTurn on the safety lights using the switch on the wall opposite the control panel.\n\tNOTE: This tells other researchers not to enter the room when the shock tube is charging.\nTurn on the switch on the solenoid control box to close the solenoid.",
    "NOTE: This safety feature closes a valve located on the double breech chamber, allowing for the system to be charged.\nOn the control panel, slowly open the flow control by turning the knob counterclockwise to gradually increase the pressure within the compression chamber. Monitor the pressure using the control panel display.\nOnce the diaphragm burst pressure is reached, the diaphragm will rupture and a \"bang\" will be heard. Quickly close the flow control by turning the knob.\n\tNOTE: The shock wave will travel down the tube over the cell sample and out the end of the tube.\nOpen the solenoid by turning off the switch on the solenoid control box and switch off the safety light (using the switch on the wall opposite the control panel).\nTransfer the cell sample to the sterile hood, remove the adhesive gas-permeable membranes, and fill the dish with 2 mL of fresh growth medium. The cells can be used immediately for assessment, as described in step 5, or returned to the incubator for longer-term studies.\n5. Cell Viability\nAssess cell viability following shock wave exposure using the combination of a redox indicator assay and the fluorescent imaging of live and dead cells.\n\tNOTE: For fluorescent imaging, cells must be seeded onto sterile glass coverslips during section 1: Cell culture and sample preparation. These can be placed within the 35-mm petri dishes.\nTransfer 200 µL of the redox indictor reagent (see the Table of Materials) to each experimental dish directly after refilling them with 2 mL of medium post-shock wave exposure. Incubate at standard culture conditions for 4 h.\nFor each dish, transfer (in a dark sterile hood) 2 x 100 µL aliquots to either a black or clear 96-well plate, depending on whether fluorescence or absorbance will be used to assess viability.",
    "Transfer the 96-well plate to an appropriate plate reader fitted with the correct filters and read using excitation bands 530ex/590em for fluorescence or 570 nm combined with a 600-nm reference for absorbance. Export and save the data.\nAnalyze the data to identify any difference between shock wave-exposed samples and non-exposed controls, as this can indicate a drop in cell viability.\n\tNOTE: A negative control should also be included in the experimental design. Furthermore, the interpolation of a standard curve can be used to calculate cell numbers.\nAspirate the medium containing the redox indicator reagent. Replace it with 2 mL of fresh medium and incubate the cells at standard culture conditions for 24 h.\nRepeat the above steps as necessary to obtain a second viability time point.\nFor the fluorescent imaging of live and dead cells, aspirate the medium and wash the cells twice in 1 mL of PBS. Transfer 100 µL of the complete reagent found in the imaging kit (see the Table of Materials) to each sample and incubate at room temperature protected from light for 15 min.\nAspirate the reagent and wash once using 1 mL of PBS. Using fine point forceps, carefully remove the coverslip from the 35 mm dish and place it face-down onto a glass microscopy slide.\nAcquire images for each sample using a fluorescent microscope (10X objective lens, 0.50 numerical aperture) fitted with the correct excitation and emission filters (ex/em 488 nm/515 nm and 570 nm/602 nm).\n\tNOTE: Live cells will emit intense, uniform, green fluorescence. Dead or dying cells with a compromised cellular membrane will uptake the dead kit component, resulting in the emission of red fluorescence, found predominantly in the nuclear region of the cell.",
    "Use image analysis software to either manually or automatically count the number of live and dead cells from each image."
