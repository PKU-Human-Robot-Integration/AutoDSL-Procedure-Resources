    "Sample collection, fixation, and paraffin embeddingCollect lung post-mortem biopsies and fix them for three hours at RT in 4% formaldehyde.After fixation, embed the biopsies in paraffin, following these three steps:Dehydration: The fixation agent is eliminated by successive baths of increasing ethanol concentration: three times for 30 min in 70% ethanol, followed by three times for 30 min in 85% ethanol, and three times for 30 min in 100% ethanol.Clearing: Immerse the tissues in a xylene bath three times for 20 min.Embed in liquid paraffin at 59°C.Note: These steps can be performed by an automated instrument like the “Tissue-Tek-VIP.” Cut 4-μm-thick tissue sections using a rotary microtome and place on Superfrost slides.Removal of paraffinRinse the slides in Neo Clear twice for 10 min.Place the slides in a 100% ethanol bath for 5 min.Place the slides in a 96% ethanol bath for 5 min.Place the slides in an 80% ethanol bath for 5 min.Place the slides in a 70% ethanol bath for 5 min.Place the slides in a 50% ethanol bath for 5 min.Rinse in ultrapure distilled water three times for one minute.Rinse in 1× PBS.Antigen retrievalPlace the slides in a vertical, plastic staining rack and add antigen retrieval buffer to totally immerse the paraffin-embedded samples (around 50 ml buffer for an 8-slide rack).Fill the sterilizer with an adequate amount of distilled water.Place the rack in the sterilizer and close it.Allow the sterilizer to heat to 120-135°C, and incubate for 10-15 min.After 10-15 min, open the lid and allow the slides to cool to RT on the bench for approximately 20 min.Rinse twice with 1× PBS.PermeabilizationImmerse the slides in permeabilization buffer for 2 min.Rinse twice with 1× PBS.BlockingPlace the slides in the staining rack and incubate with blocking buffer for one hour at RT.Keep the excess blocking buffer at 4°C.",
    "During the blocking step, prepare the StainTray slide staining system. Place moistened paper in the tray.Rinse the slides once with 1× PBS.Primary stainingPrepare the primary staining mix. Use 80 μl staining mix for every 1 cm2 of sample. Adapt the quantity of staining mix according to the surface area of the sample. Add goat anti-MPO at a 1/40 dilution and rabbit anti-histone 3 at a 1/100 dilution in blocking buffer.Place the slides in the staining system tray.Place the staining mix on the tissue sections to completely immerse them.Close the staining system and incubate at RT for one hour.Transfer the slides to a plastic rack.Rinse three times with 1× PBS.Secondary stainingPrepare the secondary staining mix. Add anti-goat Alexa Fluor 488 at a 1/200 dilution, anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568 at a 1/200 dilution, and DAPI at a 1/1,000 dilution in blocking buffer.Place the slides in the staining system tray.Place the staining mix on the tissue sections to completely immerse them.Close the staining system and incubate for two hours at RT.Transfer the slides to a plastic rack.Rinse three times with 1× PBS.Remove the moistened paper from the staining system tray.Dry the slides.Important: Never touch the tissue sections. From this point onward, work in a chemical fume hood to allow for optimal drying. Place a drop of ProLong Gold onto the tissue sections and add a coverslip. Allow the slides to dry overnight, protected from the light, but without totally closing the staining system to facilitate air circulation. In some experiments using other mounting media, we observed a rapid loss of the Cit-H3 staining. Since ProLong Gold is described to protect fluorescent dyes from fading and photobleaching, we chose this mounting medium.Analyze the slides and acquire images using a confocal microscope within two days of staining.ControlsYou can perform two types of negative control.",
    "You can perform primary staining with isotype control antibodies, i.e., goat IgG and rabbit IgG isotype control antibodies instead of anti-MPO and anti-citrullinated Histone 3, at similar concentrations. Alternatively, you can replace the primary staining with an incubation with sera from the host species in which the primary antibodies were produced (i.e., rabbit and goat serum). In both cases, the secondary staining remains the same."
