    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nWing imaginal disc ex vivo culture\nTiming: 15–30 min\nWith these steps you will dissect and mount the sample in the culture dish for imaging.\nNote: Practice the dissection if you are not familiar with wing disc dissection for ASP observation - cytonemes are dynamic and sensitive to perturbation.\nClean all dissection tools with 70% ethanol and allow ethanol to fully evaporate.\nPrepare the culture dish to receive the sample (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nNote: Keep the dish covered with a lid when possible.\nFor a 3D ring with membrane option, assemble on a clean surface.\nFor options with membrane and tape spacers, prepare the tape spacers attached to the glass of the 35 mm μ-Dish (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D – step 1) and have the membrane ready for placement.\nPrepare wandering stage larvae for dissection\nSelect larvae of the desired genotype.\nPlace larvae in a cell strainer (VWR; Cat#: 76327-098), rinse with 70% ethanol, rinse with sterile water.\nTransfer larvae to a dissection dish containing sterile culture media, dissect under a stereoscope (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nUse two fine forceps (VWR; Cat#: 82027-408) to cut larvae in half, preserving the anterior which contains the mouth hocks (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A – step 1).\nGrab the mouth hooks with one forceps and gently push the larval body wall with the second forceps towards the mouth hooks, flipping the cuticle inside-out (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A – step 2).\nCarefully remove fat body, gut, ventral nerve cord (VNC), leaving imaginal discs and trachea (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A – step 3).\nPlace 20 μL of media in the middle of the μ-Dish and transfer the cleaned sample to it (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nDissect the two wing discs from the carcass, while preserving as much attached trachea as possible.",
    "Note: Preparations should include dorsal trunk (DT) and lateral trunk (LT) anterior and posterior to wing disc, as well as the stalk (most dorsal tip) of the wing disc. Haltere and leg discs linked to the wing disc may be included.\nPlace the wing disc with the side attached to trachea (columnar epithelial cells) oriented down, in contact with the glass surface. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]\nDiscard other larval material.\nCarefully place the pre-assembled 3D ring on top of the 20 μL drop of medium OR place the membrane over the drop and attach to the double-sided tape spacers. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]\nCarefully add 2 mL of media to the μ-Dish and close the lid (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nCritical: The ASP is sensitive to touch and turbulence; it is important to dissect the wing disc quickly without touching or pinching it. Multiple discs may be added to the same dish to increase the chance of having a properly oriented, undamaged sample.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1405-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Dissection scheme of the wing imaginal disc for ASP cytoneme visualization ex vivo\n(A) The clean larvae are placed in a dissecting dish containing media and cut in half then the cuticle is flipped inside-out and finally the sample is cleaned by removing unwanted tissues (A). The sample is transferred to a 20 μL drop of media in the culture dish where the indicated tracheas are cut (dashed lines) and the wing imaginal disc is released.\n(B) Then place the tissue with the trachea facing the glass bottom, and the filter membrane will gently keep the tissue in place (B) according to steps 1–6 in step-by-step method details[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details].\nImaging cytonemes with a confocal microscope\nTiming: 1–5 h",
    "In this step, images will be captured with a point scanning or spinning disc confocal microscope. To observe cytoneme dynamics for up to 4–5 h, the microscope must be equipped for fast acquisition and low laser intensity to minimize phototoxicity. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]\nPlace the 35 mm μ-Dish containing the sample on the stage of an inverted microscope\nLocate the wing disc and choose the appropriate objective.\nIn this protocol we report images made with an Olympus FV3000 inverted point scanning confocal microscope using the oil immersion objective UPLFLN40XO.\nNote: This protocol is suitable for a variety of inverted confocal microscopes and objectives.\nSelect appropriate laser (i.e.: 488 nm for GFP excitation).\nUse low laser power to minimize phototoxicity\nUse maximum detection voltage gain such that structures of ASP cells remain detectable, and background levels are not excessive.\nAdjust zoom if necessary.\nChoose the lowest pixel resolution that allows visualization of cytonemes (i.e.: 0.200 μm/pixel).\nSet z-stack acquisition to image the entire depth of ASP.\nCrop to area of interest\nInclude ample space around ASP because the tissue may move during imaging and cytonemes will extend at least 40 μm from the ASP surface\nNote: Acquisition time for each z-stack should be less than one minute to resolve cytoneme movement (i.e.: 60 stacks with 0.5 μm spacing imaged at 1 stack/min.). Size of cropped area or depth of the z-stack can be reduced if acquisition takes longer than one minute.\nSet total acquisition time for total period of viewing.\nNote: The total acquisition time interval must be greater than or equal to the sum of all z-stack acquisition times."
