    "All methods described here have been approved by The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), KA2016-08.\n1. Synaptosome Purification\nNOTE: These procedures are adapted from a previously published paper19 with several modifications to improve the yield of purified synaptosomes (Figure 1).\nPrepare discontinuous density gradient media.\n\t\nPlace the following on ice: 3%, 10%, and 23% density gradient solutions in gradient buffer (bring to 250 mL of water with 109.54 g of sucrose, 606 mg of Tris, and 5 mL of 0.2 M EDTA, pH 7.4); homogenizing buffer (add 25 mL of 4x gradient buffer and 500 µL of 50 mM DTT into 74.5 mL of water); homogenizer mortar and pestle.\n\t\tNOTE: Density gradient solution and preparation are presented in the Table 1. To prepare 3%, 10%, and 23% density gradient solutions, use raw density gradient solution.\nPrepare six ultra-clear centrifuge tubes per three adult mice.\nAdd 3 mL of 23% density gradient solution on the bottom of each centrifuge tube with a 1-mL pipette. Then, slowly make a layer with 3 mL of 10% density gradient solution on top of the 23% density gradient solution with a pasture pipette and 1-mL pipette. Finally, add 3 mL of 3% density gradient solution on top. In this step, use caution to avoid introducing bubbles.\nCover the centrifuge tubes with plastic wrap and keep the tubes on ice.\nPrecool a high-speed centrifuge and ultracentrifuge to 4 °C.\nSterilize surgical equipment (operating scissors, Castroviejo spring scissors, and curved forceps) with 70% ethanol. Prepare a small glass beaker with 25 mL of homogenizing buffer on ice and weigh the beaker.\nExtract the brains from three adult (approximately 12 weeks old) male mice.",
    "Dislocate the cervical vertebra and cut the neck with operating scissors. Peel off the skin of the head and skull along the midline using operating scissors and curved forceps. Excise the olfactory bulbs and cerebellum with Castroviejo spring scissors.\nPut the remaining brains into the beaker with curved forceps and weigh the brains. Rinse the brains several times with ice-cold homogenizing buffer to remove blood on the surface of brains.\n\tNOTE: Previously, 9 mL of homogenizing buffer to 1 g of brain tissues was recommended.\nAdd 4 mL of homogenizing buffer and 1 g of brain tissues to the homogenizer mortar. While homogenizing the brains, add homogenizing buffer up to 8 mL.\nDivide the homogenate into two 50-mL high-speed centrifuge tubes. Wash the mortar with 1 mL of fresh homogenizing buffer and add it to the tubes.\n\tCaution: Proceed through steps 1.3-1.7 as quickly as possible. Less than 20 min is recommended.\nCentrifuge the homogenates in high-speed centrifuge tubes at 1,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C with slower brakes.\n\tNOTE: Set the deceleration rate (brake) at two or three when the maximum rate of deceleration is nine.\nCarefully add the supernatant to a new 50-mL tube and add up to 12 mL of homogenizing buffer.\nCarefully and slowly pipette 2 mL of diluted supernatant over the 3% density gradient solution with a 1-mL pipette and place the tubes on ice.\nCentrifuge at 31,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C with no brakes.\n\tNOTE: Set the deceleration rate at one (zero) or coast.",
    "Place the tubes on ice and collect the synaptosome fraction between the 23% density gradient solution and 10% density gradient solution with a 2-mL pipette into a 50-mL tube. Add ice-cold sucrose/EDTA buffer up to 80 mL and divide it into four 50-mL high-speed centrifuge tubes.\n\tNOTE: See Figure 3 for fractionated synaptosomes with labeled gradients.\nCentrifuge at 20,000 x g for 30 min at 4 ˚C with fewer breaks.\n\tNOTE: Set the deceleration rate at two or three when the maximum rate of deceleration is nine.\nCarefully remove the supernatant with a 1-mL pipette, resuspend the synaptosome pellet with 1 mL of isotonic physiological buffer (140 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM HEPES, and 10 mM glucose, pH 7.4)20. Add 1 mL of 10% DMSO in isotonic physiological buffer (final concentration of DMSO: 5%) and collect the synaptosomes into one 50-mL high-speed centrifuge tube.\nAliquot 1 mL into 1.5-mL tubes. Measure the protein concentration of the synaptosomes using the Bradford assay.\nQuickly freeze the tubes and store the tubes in a -80 °C deep freezer until pH indicator conjugation.\n2. pH Indicator Conjugation\nCentrifuge 1.5-mL tubes with synaptosomes at 21,092 x g for 3-4 min at 4 °C.\nRemove the supernatant, add 200 µL of 0.1 M Na2CO3 and mix well by pipetting.\n\tNOTE: Na2CO3 was added to raise the pH as succinimidyl ester most efficiently reacts with primary amines at a slightly alkaline pH.\nAdd 2 µL of pH indicator to the tube and gently vortex.\n\tCaution: Use 1 µL of pH indicator per 0.3 mg of synaptosome solution.\nMinimize light exposure by covering the tubes with aluminum foil and incubate them for 1-2 h at room temperature (RT) in a twist shaker with gentle agitation at 30-40 rpm.",
    "Stop agitation and add 1 mL of DPBS.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 21,092 x g for 1-2 min.\nRemove the supernatant and add 1 mL of DPBS to resuspend the pellet by gentle pipetting.\nRepeat steps 2.6-2.7 at least seven times to remove unbound pH indicator.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 200 µL of DPBS with 5% DMSO.\n\tNOTE: At this point, all synaptosomes are non-functional. We have confirmed that phosphatidylserine (PS) has been exposed to the outer membrane of synaptosomes, which functions as an \"eat-me\" signal (Figure 4).\n3. Astrocytes and Microglia Purification\nNOTE: This protocol for astrocyte purification is adapted from a previously published paper21. In this protocol, the purification of rat astrocytes and microglia is described. Specific procedures for purifying mouse astrocytes and microglia are also described in the notes.\nDay before purification\nPrepare pre-coated cell culture dishes and solutions.\nPrepare five 145 mm x 20 mm Petri dishes with 25 mL of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.5).

    "NOTE: To attach secondary antibody to the hydrophobic surface of the Petri dish, slow attachment at low temperatures is recommended. However, it is possible to coat the Petri dish with secondary antibody for 2 h at 37 °C. Antibodies for astrocyte panning are used differently depending on the animal species; for example, HepaCAM dish for mouse astrocytes: 60 µL of 2.4 mg/mL goat anti-mouse IgG+IgM (H+L)\nDay of Purification\nPrepare for immunopanning.\nPrepare 50-mL tubes and add stocks to the tubes.

Swirl the solution in the dish.\n\t\tNOTE: DNase is used to inhibit aggregation of DNA from ruptured cells.\nPlace the dish into a 34 °C heat block and cover it with a lid that has a hole in the middle. Use a soldering iron to make the hole in the lid of the 60-mm Petri dish.\nConnect 22-µm syringe filters to a CO2 tank tube and place the filter tip into the hole.",
    "Incubate the dish at 34 °C for 45 min. Swirl the solution in the dish every 10 to 15 min.\nFinish preparation of the panning dishes.\n\t\nRemove the panning dishes that have been coated with secondary antibodies from the freezer a day ahead of time.

Phagocytosis Live-imaging Assay (Figure 2)\nPrepare a 24-well plate (or any plate/dish that is prepared for live-imaging) in which astrocytes are confluent (generally, 7 to 10 days of incubation after the purification is ideal for stabilizing the cells).\nRemove the media in each well and wash the wells with 1 mL of DPBS, three times. To minimize air exposure, wash the wells quickly.\nAdd 300 µL of IP-ABM with 5 µL of pH indicator-conjugated synaptosomes and additional factors such as IP-ACM that can modulate glial cell phagocytosis.\nIncubate the plate in a CO2 incubator for 40 min.
