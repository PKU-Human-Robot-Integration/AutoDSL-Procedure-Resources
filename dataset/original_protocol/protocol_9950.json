    "CAUTION: There is a risk of burns caused by hot soldering irons and heating cartridges. The heating cartridge should never be powered when not secured inside of the heating jacket. There is also a risk of pinching or lacerations from the moving 3D printer axis.\n1. Overview and preparation\nNOTE: Figure 1A shows a computer-generated rendering of the printer and Figure 1B is a photo of the finished printer.\nProcure all parts from the Table of Materials.\nSee https://www.thingiverse.com/Addme/designs[href=https://www.thingiverse.com/Addme/designs] for all acrylic parts to be laser cut. Insure that 6 mm acrylic is used or the frame will not fit together. Laser cutters use a high energy laser to cut material; a professional shop is preferred here.\nSee https://www.thingiverse.com/Addme/designs[href=https://www.thingiverse.com/Addme/designs] for all 3D-printed parts. It is important that the printing parameters specified with each part are used. Note that 3D printers have hot surfaces and moving parts, so use the help of a professional.\nManufacture the heating jacket part, which is found at https://www.thingiverse.com/Addme/designs[href=https://www.thingiverse.com/Addme/designs]. If there is no available access to manufacturing capabilities, a silicone heater (Table of Materials) can be purchased with the associated 3D printed holder found at https://www.thingiverse.com/Addme/designs[href=https://www.thingiverse.com/Addme/designs].\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59834/59834fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Additive manufacturing melt extrusion (ADDME) 3D printer.

    "NOTE: For more detailed instructions and troubleshooting information, see https://reprap.org/wiki/RAMPS_1.4[href=https://reprap.org/wiki/RAMPS_1.4].\nDownload firmware from http://marlinfw.org/meta/download/[href=http://marlinfw.org/meta/download/].\nInstall repetier https://www.repetier.com/[href=https://www.repetier.com/].\nReplace the file .configuration in the firmware found in https://www.thingiverse.com/Addme/designs[href=https://www.thingiverse.com/Addme/designs].\nSet buad rate in repetier to 112500 by navigating (in repetier) to Configure | Printer Settings | Connection | Baud Rate: 115200.\nClick the Connect icon in repetier.\nOnce connected, full control over the printer is achieved. Navigate to Manual Control to move the printing bed and try setting the temperature.\n\tCAUTION: Make sure that the maximum temperature of the syringe or housing components is not exceeded (see the discussion for more information). While the stepper motors have limited power, the movement of the axis presents a mechanical hazard.\n\tNOTE: At this stage there is a fully operating printer. In the following section (section 8), the procedure for getting the printer ready for 3D printing is described.\n8. Preparation for 3D printing\nLoad a 2 mL syringe with the desired material, such as viscous cream, chocolate, or pluronic (Figure 11A).\nTo place the syringe into the extrusion head, start by inserting the syringe into plunger lock 1 (3DP 11, Figure 11B). Next, insert the syringe into the heating jacket while carefully turning the threaded screws (Figure 11C).\nOptional: if the bed has not been leveled, it is necessary to level it. Move the printing head left and right then up and down, and check if the distance between the bed and syringe nozzle is consistent. Slide a piece of paper between the syringe and bed and feel the friction (Figure 11E), then use the M3 Allen key (Figure 11D) to adjust the bed level if required.",
    "Optional: if the chosen material needs to be heated, do this now. Navigate to the Manual Control tab in repetier and set the temperature to the desired level.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59834/59834fig11.jpg\nFigure 11: 3D printing preparation.
