    "The collection of human placenta from term deliveries was approved by the Domain Specific Review Board of the NUH of Singapore (DSRB C/00/524) and by the Siriraj Institutional Review Board (SIRB 704/2559) of Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok. In all cases, patients gave separate informed written consent for the use of the collected specimen. The pig bladders were collected from a local butcher in Singapore and were a kind donation from Dr. Ying Woo Ng (NUH). The non-human primate (NHP) placentas were waste material collected from breeding Macaca fascicularis under the Ministry of Health (Singapore) National Medical Research Council grant NMRC/CSA/043/2012, strictly adhering to the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the National University of Singapore and Singapore Health Services Pte Ltd (IACUC 2009-SHS-512) and were a kind donation from A/Prof Jerry Chan.\n1. Familiarization with Fetoscope Handling and Placental Orientation Using a Fetoscopy Simulator\nSet up the fetoscopy simulator and equipment (Figure 2A - C).\n\t\nIdentify the parts of the 2.0 mm fiber straight fetoscope: the lens (0° or 30°), standard or remote eye-cap (Figure 2A); the 3.0 mm double lumen operating sheath with sharp obturator tip for direct insertion into amniotic cavity under ultrasound guidance, for use with the 2.0 mm fetoscope (Figure 2B).\nPlace the fetoscope into the operating sheath after removal of the obturator and connect the eye-cap to the laparoscope camera.\n\t\tNOTE: These straight fiber-endoscopes are semi-flexible and operating sheaths can be carefully bent up to 20-35° from the midline axis to provide the appropriate curvature for use with anterior placentas. Bend the operating sheath without the endoscope inside. Other suitable fetoscopes for posterior and anterior placentas are listed in the Table of Materials.",
    "Arrange the laparoscope tower and ultrasound machine near the \"operator\" so that the ultrasound probe can be manipulated at the same time during the fetoscope insertion.\n\t\nFill the fetoscopy simulator to the brim with water through one of the one-way valve ports.\nPosition the filled simulator on the plastic base in the desired orientation to represent either an anterior or posterior placenta (Figure 2C).\n\t\tNOTE: The upper surface of the simulator will now represent the anterior maternal abdomen where the ultrasound probe is placed and where the fetoscope should be inserted.\nUse the curvilinear ultrasound probe with aqueous gel on the transparent skin of the \"anterior maternal abdomen\" to visualize the placenta within the fetoscopy simulator. Identify the placental location and a window adjacent to it (for an anterior placenta) in which to place the fetoscope.\nInsert the appropriate fetoscope in the operating sheath through the port under continuous ultrasound guidance (Figure 2C).\n\t\nUse the 0° straight fetoscope for a posterior placenta and the 0° curved fetoscope for an anterior placenta (Table of Materials).\nMonitor the insertion and depth of the fetoscope by ultrasound and bring the placenta into view.\nAdjust the focus of the camera to bring the vision into sharp relief (Figure 2D - F).\nIdentify the inter-twin membranes which are juxtaposed to the vascular equator.\n\t\nIdentify the vascular equator on the surface of placenta and explore the vasculature moving from end-to-end systematically to identify the typical AVAs for ablation.\n\t\tNOTE: These anastomoses will be seen running on the chorionic surface; the artery is darker and always runs over the vein (Figure 2C,E).\nChange the orientation of the simulator to represent the posterior placenta if practice has been done with an anterior placenta, or vice versa.",
    "Repeat the process of ultrasound assessment, planning fetoscope entry, and inserting the fetoscope.\n\t\tNote: The orientation of the simulator and thus of the placenta can be changed each time to practice the fetoscopic placement for various positions of placenta, and also to test out different (curved, straight) fetoscopes.\n2. Tissue Models for Practice of Direct Fetoscopic Entry, the Seldinger Technique, and Laser Coagulation of Vessels\nTissue model #1 - Placenta in a box\n\t\nCreate the box model using a standard, store-bought plastic container of 35 x 18 x 15 cm3 dimensions with a watertight lock (Figure 3A).\n\t\t\nCut out a wide window of the plastic cover and replace it with ultrasound-transparent rubber \"skin\" stitched to the margins of the cover. This forms the anterior surface of the simulated maternal abdomen through which the fetoscope is placed. Mount a rubber latex sheet along the bottom of the box to prevent sonographic reverberation (Figure 3A - C).\nCollect human placentas after term births, with the proper consent for sample collection. Wash the surface of the placenta with tap water in the sink (it is best to do so in the utility room of the labor ward before transport). Ensure that the placental surface is clean of blood and cut the umbilical cord using strong tissue scissors to a manageable length, e.g., 5 cm.\n\t\t\nTransport the placenta in a sealed biohazard plastic bag within a secondary container to the laboratory.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Always handle the placenta and other biological substances using personal protective equipment (disposable gloves, eye shields, etc.). Ensure the proper institutional ethical approvals are in place before carrying out this work.\nTie the free end of the umbilical cord by a suture band or cotton cord tape to prevent the blood running out of the cut end.",
    "NOTE: The blood in the vessels will also help simulate vessel laceration from over-coagulation during laser practice.\nTo simulate an anterior placenta, fix the placenta to the re-fashioned lid of the container with clear plastic thread or a plastic net to hold it in place.\nTo simulate a posterior placenta, fix the placenta to the rubber sheet at the bottom of the container and hold it in place with a plastic net or small weights (Figure 3B).\nFill the container with tap water and lock the lid in place.\nPrepare the 0° straight fetoscope for a posterior placenta and its operating sheath with working channel, and the multichannel 0° curved fetoscope for anterior placenta (Table of Materials). Connect the eye-cap to the camera.\n\t\t\nPrepare the laser. For example, if using the diode laser with a 400-μm or 600-μm laser fiber, set the initial voltage at 15-30 W and gradually increase if needed for effective coagulation.\nPerform the ultrasound assessment of the placenta as described in step 1.3.\n\t\t\nFind a placenta-free window adjacent to the anterior placenta in which to insert the curved fetoscope such that the lens lies above the center of the placenta (where the inter-twin equator is expected to be in a MCDA placenta).\nDetermine where to insert the straight fetoscope for the posterior placenta such that the 0° lens is positioned perpendicular to the center of the placenta.\nPerform direct fetoscopic entry by making a 2-mm stab incision with a sharp blade in the \"skin\". Insert the operating trocar with its pyramidal obturator into the fluid-filled container (the \"amniotic sac\") under continuous ultrasound guidance (this is the sac of the recipient twin in a patient).",
    "Avoid piercing the placenta by advancing the fetoscope slowly under ultrasound vision. Remove the pyramidal obturator from the operating trocar slowly under continuous ultrasound vision.\nPlace the lens of the fetoscope carefully into the operating trocar in the channel previously occupied by the obturator, and bring the placenta and surface vasculature into sharp focus (Figure 3C).\nInsert the laser fiber into the operating side-channel and advance slowly as the tip nears the end of the sheath.\n\t\t​NOTE: Keep the laser beam as perpendicular as possible to the target vessel in order to maximize the laser effect46,47.\n\t\t\nAdvance the laser fiber tip to approximately 5-10 mm beyond the operating sheath.\n\t\t\tNOTE: If the laser tip advances too far from the sheath, it may lacerate the vessel. If the tip is too close, the coagulation effect may be compromised (Figure 3D). The laser fiber tip should be 2-3 mm from the vessel surface and should not touch the vessel when fired (yellow arrow in Figure 3D).\nIdentify the umbilical cord (Figure 3E) and placental vessels (Figure 3F). Review the placental vasculature end-to-end using a combination of ultrasound and direct fetoscopic vision.\n\t\tNOTE: The fetoscope should be directed at a 90° angle to the target vessel. Figure 3G shows the actual monochorionic AVA in a monochorionic placenta. Use the foot pedal to fire the laser when in position perpendicular to the vessel or anastomosis.\nCoagulate the vessel until it blanches with the no-touch technique and aim to coagulate a segment of 1-2 cm until complete cessation of flow is accomplished. The vessel should appear flattened (collapsed) and pale for coagulation to be deemed effective.",
    "Systematically practice coagulation of vessels from one placental end to the other. Laser coagulate the thick vessels from the periphery towards the center of the vessel to prevent rupture (thus \"shaving\" a thicker turgid vessel into a narrower less congested one). Alternatively, coagulate the smaller feeding vessels first before the larger ones to allow decongestion and prevent vascular rupture.\nPractice the Solomon technique after individual vessels have been coagulated to complete placental dichorionisation48,49. Create a line on the placental surface by superficial coagulation with the laser until all the individually-coagulated anastomoses are joined.\nTissue model #2 - Pig bladder \"uterus\"\n\t​NOTE: A hybrid tissue model combining a pig bladder and a mid-trimester human placenta may also be considered for simulation if the materials are readily available. This model can be used to practice insufflation and removal of fluid from the \"uterus\" to recreate commonly encountered complications of fetoscopy like blood-stained liquor, and to practice the Seldinger technique of fetoscope insertion.\n\t\nAcquire a cleaned pig bladder. Position it with the broader curved perimeter as the upper cephalad pole and the narrower portion as the lower caudal pole, so that the user can bisect along the cephalad border and proceed caudally, such that the bladder opens like a clamshell (Figure 4A, broken line).\n\t\tNOTE: Perform all procedures with human and animal tissues in a biological safety cabinet wearing personal protective equipment and with the appropriate institutional approval for handling biological tissues.\nAcquire a small mid-gestation human placenta after delivery or medically-induced pregnancy termination. Ensure that the proper consent is attained, and the specimen is anonymized.",
    "Trim the excess amniotic membranes from the placenta (filmy, white tissue attached to the fetal/umbilical surface) using tissue scissors and suture the placenta (red arrow, fetal surface outwards, maternal surface inwards) around its perimeter to one half of the pig bladder. Suture the second half of the pig bladder (black arrow) to the first around the incision in a water-tight fashion (Figure 4B, C).\nPlace the \"uterus\" in the model pelvis as shown in Figure 4D. Orientate the uterus to simulate either an anterior or posterior placenta (Figure 4D).\nUnder ultrasound guidance (if the rubber skin is transparent to ultrasound) practice direct insertion of the trocar and fetoscope within its operating sheath.\nPractice the Seldinger technique using a sharp hollow trocar inserted into the amniotic space under real-time ultrasound guidance. Advance the soft J-tipped guidewire through the lumen and withdraw the trocar, passing a blunt cannula loaded with a dilator over the guidewire into the amniotic space before withdrawing the guidewire and dilator altogether, leaving the cannula in place. Finally, insert the fetoscope into the uterus via the cannula (Figure 4E).\nExamine the vessels on the placental surface fetoscopically. Reduce or add fluid via the operating channel with a 50-mL syringe to increase or decrease \"intrauterine\" pressure and to replace blood-stained or turbid fluid with fresh saline.\nPractice laser coagulation of vessels in the same manner described in steps 2.1.11-2.1.12.\nDispose the model as biohazardous material according to institutional protocol.\n3. Transferring Skills Learned on the Model to the Human Patient\nOn the patient with a MCDA twin pregnancy, perform ultrasound examination of the placenta and identify the cord insertion points of both fetuses on the placenta.",
    "​NOTE: In this case, one of the cords may be inserted close to the margin of the MCDA placenta. Imagine a line joining the two placental cord insertions and determine the midpoint of this line which indicates the location of the vascular equator and may be closer to the smaller donor twin rather than equidistant to both cords especially with a significant amniotic sac size discrepancy. The vascular equator lies perpendicular to the line joining the cords.\nDetermine the site of fetoscope insertion.\n\t\nFor an anterior placenta, find a window under ultrasound visualization of the placenta, free from placental tissue, from which the curved fetoscope can be manipulated such that the lens lies over the vascular equator.\nFor a posterior placenta, insert the fetoscope at the approximate midpoint between the cords directly over the vascular equator. Move the fetoscopic lens up and down the vascular equator using a sweeping movement while maintaining an approximately 90° angle to the equator, optimal for laser coagulation.\n\t\tNOTE: This may require the insertion site to be lateral to the vascular equator, just beyond the periphery of the placenta on the side of the polyhydramnios sac.\nCheck for completion of placental dichorionization after the delivery of the fetuses to assess for residual anastomoses (Figure 5A - C). Inject the umbilical cord vessels with different colored dyes to distinguish between the donor and recipient arteries and veins after the necessary preparation as previously described44,50.\nSubscription Required.
