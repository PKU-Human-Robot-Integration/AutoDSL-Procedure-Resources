    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nOverview experimental schedule\nGeneration of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs)\nTiming: Procedure: 60–90 min; Proliferation and differentiation: 6 days\nThe following steps provide the procedure of collection and differentiation of bone marrow-derived cells into BMDMs.\nFemur and tibia collection.\nEuthanize BL6/J mouse, disinfect and fixate in supine position.\nCarefully expose femur and tibia from surrounding muscles and tissue (a detailed protocol can be found in Toda et al., (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nStore prepared bones in 10 mL of ice-cold PBS for transfer to laminar air flow.\nCollection and straining of bone marrow-derived cells.\nPrepare 50 mL conic tube and 40 μm strainer (one per mouse).\nRemove the epiphyses from femurs & tibias.\nFlush out the bone marrow from femurs and tibiae onto the 40 μm strainer.\nUse a 23 G needle on a 1 mL syringe (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) filled with sterile PBS, position the needle in the bone shaft and carefully flush until bone marrow is mobilized. Repeat procedure until all bone marrow is on the strainer.\nUse syringe plunger and additional 10 mL PBS to flush the remaining cells through the strainer into the conic tube. Afterward fill up volume with PBS to 20 mL.\nWash cells by centrifuging the tube at 500 g for 8 min at room temperature (RT; 20°C–25°C).\nResuspend in 20 mL PBS and wash again (500 g for 8 min).\nSeeding of bone marrow-derived cells in culture dishes for differentiation.\nResuspend with 2 mL BMDM medium and use a Neubauer counting chamber or an automated cell counter (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) to acquire cell numbers.\nIn our experience, 2 femurs and tibiae from one mouse provide approx. 6–10 × 107 cells).",
    "Prepare a cell suspension with 3–5 × 107 bone marrow-derived cells in 2 mL BMDM medium (1.5–2.5 × 107 cells per mL) and seed them on a 15 cm cell culture dish (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nProvide 150 ng of M-CSF to each culture dish, add additional 13 mL of BMDM medium and place the cells in the incubator at 37°C. The final concentration of M-CSF is 10 ng/mL.\nDifferentiation and proliferation of BMDMs from day 2 to 6.\nProvide 150 ng of M-CSF and 3 mL BMDM medium to each culture dish daily for another 4 continuous days. The culture should provide healthy macrophages with a ramified, mononuclear morphology after 6–7 d (as seen in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1204-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Culturing T cells and BMDMs\n(A) Differentiated, confluent BMDMs 6 days after culturing the initial bone marrow-dervied cells.\n(B) Representative image of cultured splenic T cells in an anti CD3/CD28-coated U-bottom well.\n(C) Differentiated BMDMs before being primed with 100 ng/mL LPS.\n(D) Differentiated BMDMs after the first 2 h LPS priming. Loss of ramifications and the swelling of the cell body indicates successful priming (white arrowheads, shown before in e.g., Kawakami et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). In panel (A), (C) and (D) scale bars represent 100 μm. In panel B scale bar represents 1 mm.\nCritical: For setting up a pure macrophage culture it is important to observe the cells daily (ramified morphology, loss of other bone marrow-derived cells over time, cell confluency (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A)). Alternatively, L929 (murine connective tissue fibroblast cell line; ATCC, US; see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) -conditioned medium can be used as a substitute for recombinant M-CSF.\nHarvest and seeding of BMDMs in 96-well plates\nTiming: 30 min; day 7 after BMDM culture start",
    "In this step, the differentiated BMDMs will be seeded on 96-well plates 1 day prior to the coculture approach. Carefully check the ramified morphology and adhesion of BMDMs, as indicator for viability, before starting the following steps.\nHarvest of BMDMs from the 15 cm culture dishes.\nPBS and BMDM medium needs to be warmed up to 37°C.\nRemove the medium from the culture dish and carefully wash the dish twice by slowly pouring 10 mL pre-warmed PBS on the dish, panning and removal of the PBS.\nAdd 10 mL pre-warmed PBS and detach the cells by gentle scraping with cell scraper (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]), collect the cell suspension in conic 50 mL tube. Check the dish visually for remaining cells. Avoid intensive scraping and formation of bubbles, to receive healthy cells.\nOptional: Add another 10 mL PBS to the dish, repeat scraping and collect the cell suspension in the same conic 50 mL tube.\nAdd the cell suspension volume up to 20 mL by eventually adding PBS and wash at 300g for 7 min at RT.\nWash again (300 g for 7 min, RT).\nSeeding of BMDMs into 96-well plate.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend the cells in 2 mL BMDM medium.\nAcquire cell numbers and seed 1 × 105 BMDMs per well into a flat-bottom 96-well plate (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nPlace the cells in the incubator at 37°C and let them settle and ramify overnight (12–18 h).\nT cell isolation from murine spleen\nTiming: 90–120 min; Expansion: 1 day\nIn this step, splenic T cells will be enriched from murine spleen. This is achieved by using a magnetic bead-based commercial T cell negative selection kit. Make sure that you have prepared anti-CD3ε-coated 96-well plates before starting isolation. Coating with anti-CD3e antibody is essential for functional T cell culture.",
    "Spleen collection.\nEuthanize Bl6/J mouse, disinfect and fixate in supine position.\nOpen the abdomen and expose the spleen from surrounding fat tissue.\nRemove the spleen and store in 10 mL of ice-cold PBS for transfer to laminar air flow.\nCollection, straining and enrichment of splenic T cells.\nNote: The T cell isolation was done with the MagniSort T cell enrichment kit (ThermoFisher, US; see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]). Volumes and incubation times are according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\nThe used antibody cocktail contains: Anti-mouse CD11b, CD19, CD24, CD45R, CD49b, Ly6G and TER-119 according to the manufacturer’s data sheet. Using alternative kits for T cell enrichment/isolation is possible.\nPrepare conic 50 mL tube and 40 μm strainer.\nMince the spleen using scissors and carefully press tissue through the 40 μm strainer with a syringe plunger while continuously rinsing with a least 10 mL PBS\nFill up volume to at least 20 mL volume and wash the suspension at 300 g for 10 min at RT.\nAcquire cell numbers and titrate the concentration to 107 cells per 100 μL.\nTransfer the whole cell suspension into a 5 mL “FACS” tube (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table])\nAdd 20 μL of the T cell enrichment antibody cocktail (please see “Note” for the T cell enrichment kit) per 100 μL cell suspension, briefly vortex at least 3 times and incubate 10 min at RT. Red blood cell lysis is not required here, the antibody cocktail of the enrichment kit implements anti-TER-119, removing red blood cells.\nBring the suspension volume up to 4 mL with Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS, see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) and wash at 300 g for 8 min at RT.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend with 100 μL HBSS per 107 cells.",
    "Add 20 μL of the magnetic bead-labeled antibodies per 100 μL cell suspension, briefly vortex at least 3 times and incubate for 5 min at RT.\nBring the volume up to 2.5 mL with HBSS and place the FACS tube into the supplied magnet (see “Note”) for 5 min at RT. In this critical step separation of magnetic bead-labeled immune cells and unlabeled T cells is conducted.\nDecant carefully the suspension from the “magnetized” tube into a fresh 4 mL FACS tube (=enriched T cells).\nOptional: Remove the remaining tube (= removed splenocytes, antibody-labeled) and use the cells for quality control via flow cytometry.\nSeeding T cells and initiation of proliferation.\nWash the enriched T cells at 300 g for 8 min (RT).\nAcquire cell numbers and titrate to a concentration of 3 × 105 cells per 200 μL with T cell medium (see “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]”).\nPlace 200 μL T cell suspension per well onto a U-bottom 96-well plate (pre-coated with CD3e antibody; see “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]” and key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nAfter letting the cells settle for 15 min add CD28 antibody (10 μL; 0.1 μg/μL) to the T cells.\nPlace the cells overnight (12–18 h) into an incubator at 37°C for settling.\nControl the viability of the T cells before starting the coculture approach (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nCoculture procedure\nTiming: 9–10 h\nTiming: 10 min; 4 h of priming for step 10\nTiming: 30 min for step 11\nTiming: 10 min; 15–30 min stimulation for step 12\nTiming: 10 min; 2–6 h incubation, variable incubation times possible for step 13",
    "Here we describe the procedure of coculturing BMDMs, primed with LPS and stimulated with murine stroke serum, together with (anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 stimulated) splenic CD3+ T cells. These are the most critical steps, which should be well prepared (pre-warmed medium etc.).\nCritical is to control adhesion and ramified morphology of the macrophages. Also the T cells need visual control: Dark spots in the T cell wells represent expansion clusters, which show the vitality of T cells. In case, BMDMs or T cells do not look as expected, the cells can be incubated for an additional day for settling / expansion in the incubator or the preparation of cell population should be repeated. Use only cell suspensions of optimal conditions for the coculture.\nBMDMs: Priming for inflammasome activation.\nDilute 100 ng/mL LPS (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) in BMDM medium for priming the macrophage’s inflammasome. Incubate for 4 h at 37°C in the incubator (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C).\nOptional: Control the cells visually 2 h after start priming. They should show an expanded nucleus and tend to an amoeboid morphology.\nPause point: During the 4 h of BMDM priming everything for T cells and later-on procedure can be prepared.\nT cells: Preparation for cell–cell interaction.\nCarefully pipette T cells out of U-bottom wells into a 15 mL conic tube prepared with 2 mL pre-warmed T cell medium.\nWash the cells at 300 g for 10 min (RT).\nResuspend T cells in 2 mL pre-warmed T cell medium and titrate the concentration appropriate for cell–cell interaction (2 × 105 T cell per well were used in this approach, different T cell concentrations (from 1:1 up to 1:8) are possible.\nOptional: Keep cells in a conic 15 mL tube and T cell medium briefly before placing them on the stimulated BMDMs.",
    "BMDMs: Inflammasome stimulation of BMDMs with murine stroke serum.\nRemove carefully the medium from the BMDMs and immediately provide “Inflammasome stimulation medium” (see “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]”).\nKeep cells in the incubator at 37°C for the stimulation.\nNote: Ideal stimulation time can vary on the serum. We used serum, collected from mice 4–6 h after severe brain ischemia (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). This serum strongly activated the inflammasome within 15 min.\nBMDMs + T cells: Cell–cell interaction.\nCarefully remove “Inflammasome stimulation medium” from BMDMs and immediately wash once with 200 μL serum-free RPMI 1640 complete medium.\nAdd immediately 100 μL serum-free RPMI 1640 complete medium to the washed BMDMs.\nAdd T cells (2 × 105 cells in 200 μL T cell medium per well, in T cell medium) to the BMDMs. The total volume should be 300 μL (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nOptional: Centrifuge the 96-well plate at 300 g for 1 min to settle the T cells on the BMDMs.\nKeep the coculture in the incubator at 37°C until the end of the incubation.\nReadout recommendations:\nMicroscopy-based analysis: live counting of GFP+ T cells (isolated from B6 actin-eGFP mice, see “preparation of mice[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3]”) in distinct fields of view (FOVs; Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) and histology of fixed coculture .\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1204-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Representative BMDM-T cell coculture images after 90 min stimulation with sham or stroke serum\n(A) Sham serum-treated BMDMs and roundish shaped, GFP+ T cells interact (black arrow heads).\n(B) Stroke serum-treated BMDMs causing T cell death by cell–cell interaction (white arrow heads). In panel (A) and (B) scale bars represent 50 μm.",
    "Flow cytometric analysis of T cell death after coculture stimulation: All cells (per well) are harvested 2–6 h after cell–cell interaction (7.) and stained for surface markers to clearly distinct between macrophages and T cells. Possible markers: T cells (CD3), Macrophages (CD11b, F4/80), Receptor-induced cell death (FasL (CD178)), Live/death marker (Propidium Iodide, Zombie etc.; according antibodies are listed in key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]). A representative data set can be found in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].\nOptional: T cell proliferation, using CFSE, can also be analyzed by flow cytometry and can provide valuable information (e.g. Zhang et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nCells are harvested 2–6 h after the initiation of the cell–cell interaction phase. For the last 10 min of the cell–cell interaction phase, the 96-well plates are placed under the laminar air flow at room temperature.\nMedium in the wells is removed and cells are washed once with 1 mL HBSS and then harvested by carefully utilizing a cell scraper.\nCells are transferred in 5 mL conic tubes (“FACS tubes”) and volume is brought to 2 mL by adding additional HBSS to cells and held on ice.\nCells are then washed (300 g, 5min). Supernatant is discarded and the cells are resuspended in 100 μL of FACS staining buffer (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nCells are incubated with 1 μL Fc blocker (0.5 μg/mL) for 15 min in the dark at 4°C.\nAntibody cocktail (concentration per antibody: 0.5 μg/mL) is added to the cells (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nCells are incubated for 30 min in the dark at 4°C.\nAfter incubation, the cell suspension volume is brought to 2 mL with FACS staining buffer and cells are washed at 300 g for 7 min. The supernatant is discarded. Repeat this step once, to improve the cleanness for flow cytometry.",
    "Bring the cells to a final volume of 200 μL with FACS staining buffer and start acquisition (Representative results in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5])."
