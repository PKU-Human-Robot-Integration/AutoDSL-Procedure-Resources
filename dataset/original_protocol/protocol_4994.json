    "Generation of HyPer and SypHer reporter mutantsAmplify sequences for HyPer and SypHer from pC1-HyPer-2 and pC1-HyPer-C199S (SypHer) using forward primer 5’-ATG GAG ATG GCA AGC CCA GCA GGG CGA GAC GAT GT-3’ and reverse primer 5’-GCT TTT AAA CCG CCT GTT-3’ (one may add restriction enzyme recognition sites to the 5’ end of the primer to facilitate cloning in the desired binary vector).Transform the fungus according to standard protocols. For F. graminearum, the authors refer to Maier et al. (2005).Note: It is recommended to check HyPer and SypHer expression by fluorescence microscopy or RT-PCR.96-well plate assay The following paragraph describes an assay using a 96-well plate and multimode reader to analyze the response of F. graminearum mycelia to H2O2, DTT and test substances A and B, which might be any substance of choice at a given concentration to be assayed for its potential to cause an H2O2 burst in F. graminearum.Fill each well of a black 96-well plate with 100 µl minimal medium and wait 30 min until solidified.Inoculate the 96-well plate with 200 conidia (i.e., 10 µl of a 20 conidia µl-1 suspension) according to the pipetting scheme shown in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161215/20161215221646_8082.jpgFigure 1. Scheme for loading and inoculation of a 96-well assay plate to be analyzed in a fluorescence plate reader. Each well is filled with 100 µl minimal medium and inoculated with conidia of the wild type (columns 3 and 4), SypHer (columns 5 and 6), and HyPer (columns 7-12). Columns 1 and 2 remain uninoculated as control.Cover the 96-well plate, place it into a plastic bag moistened with sterile ddH2O to prevent dehydration and incubate it at 28 °C in permanent darkness for 2 days.On day 3, the HyPer assay shall be performed. Prolonged incubation leads to an accumulation of aerial hyphae that perturb measurement.",
    "Start the multimode reader and allow for the interior chamber to reach 28 °C.Prime the injectors according to the manufacturer’s instructions. By way of example, injector 1 could be primed with a 150 mM H2O2 solution, injector 2 with a 150 mM DTT solution, injector 3 with test substance A and injector 4 with test substance B at a concentration threefold the final concentration in the well.Program the measuring cycles in the plate reader software:Choose excitation filter ‘380 x 10’ and emission filter ‘520 x 10’ for measuring the fluorescence emitted by HyPer in its reduced state and excitation filter ‘485 x 14’ (emission filter ‘520 x 10’ for the oxidized state).Configure the injectors. For example, injector 1 shall inject 50 µl of the test substance at cycle 31 and injector 2 shall inject 50 µl of another substance at cycle 61. If possible, choose a slow to medium injection speed in both cases to prevent spilling.Note: The user should avoid long measuring cycles because the HyPer response is typically very fast. If a substance is injected into all wells before the measurement of fluorescence resumes, the immediate response might already be over. Yet, the authors recommend measuring one well at a time immediately after injection.  Add 100 µl ddH2O to all wells using a multi-channel pipette and let plate stand for 30 min at 28 °C.Insert plate to plate reader and start the measuring cycles.After the run, export the raw data for further analysis in a spreadsheet software program.For ratio calculations, divide the fluorescence emission value (FEV) measured after excitation with 485 nm in well A1 by the FEV after excitation with 380 nm in this particular well (equation 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161218/20161218193322_2762.",
    "jpgNote: Equation 1 represents the calculation of the ratio of fluorescence intensities measured after excitation with 485 nm and 380 nm, respectively.  Apply this to all wells. Average the ratios for the biological replicates (i.e., wells A1 to H2 for the media control) for each time point and calculate the standard deviations. Plot the averaged ratios on the y-axis against the time on the x-axis. A measurement of fungal response to H2O2 and DTT according to the procedures described above should typically result in a curve as depicted in Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161215/20161215221815_9311.jpgFigure 2. Ratiometric time course assay of the fungal response to external H2O2 and dithiothreitol (DTT). Timing of H2O2 (50 mM) and DTT (50 mM) induced ratio [485/380 nm] change in hyphae expressing HyPer, SypHer compared to the wild type (no fluorophore) and media control (MM). Mycelia were raised in a 96-well plate as described in the text and analyzed in a fluorometer. Error bars represent the standard deviation.Confocal laser scanning microscopy assayThis paragraph describes the construction and usage of a fluidic chamber for in-situ microscopy of fungal response to external H2O2 or any test substance. The assembly of the fluidic chamber is illustrated in Figure 3 and Video 1.Surface-sterilize microscope slides, e.g., in ethanol or UV light.Remove the cover foil that covers a gene frame and the window and adhere it to the slide.Fill 40 µl MM into the frame and immediately cover it with a second slide to obtain an even surface within the chamber.After 30 min, remove the upper cover slide by carefully moving it sideways and inoculate the agar surface with 300 conidia (15 µl of a 20 conidia µl-1 suspension) of mutants expressing HyPer or SypHer.",
    "Incubate in a sterile Petri dish (add 500 µl sterile ddH2O and use pipette tips as elevation) for 24 h at 28 °C in permanent darkness.On the next day, remove the cover foil of the second gene frame that covers the frame and the window and the remaining cover foil from the first gene frame. Take the second gene frame and attach it to the first frame on the slide.Cut a 1 mm and a 5 mm piece out of both gene frames to facilitate injection and drainage of a test substance, respectively (see Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161215/20161215222107_4534.jpgFigure 3. Assembly of a customized fluidic chamber for the simultaneous image acquisition and injection of test substances. Detailed description in the main text (see also Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Assembly of a fluidic chamber  Remove the remaining cover foil from the gene frame.Place a cover slip on the second frame with an overhang to the drainage port. It serves as a small reservoir for excess volume.Rinse the fluidic chamber with ddH2O using a syringe with an endo needle for root canal rinsing attached.Prefill a Heidelberger extension with a test substance (e.g., 50 mM H2O2) using a syringe and attach it to another endo needle.Mount the fluidic chamber to the stage of the CSLM.Plug the endo needle into the injection port and secure the position of the Heidelberger extension and endo needle with adhesive tape.Program a sequential acquisition of xyt-frames (lateral resolution 512 x 512, color depth: 8 bit) using excitation at 405 and 488 nm over at least 40 min with the shortest possible acquisition time and repetition rate. Detect the fluorescence signal for both channels in a range from 493 to 598 nm. Use a 40x/1.2 W objective for image acquisition.Start the scanning.",
    "Adjust laser intensity and gain of both channels so that the fluorescence signal intensity is approximately levelled in both channels (405 and 488 nm excitation). Figure 4 represents exemplarily the HyPer fluorescence in a hypha of F. graminearum.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161215/20161215222403_6089.jpgFigure 4. Fluorescence emission and bright field image of a F. graminearum hypha expressing HyPer Before starting the injection monitor steady-state fluorescence over 10 min.Carefully inject the test substance while continue scanning. In order to prevent damage of the microscope always observe the microscope slide for spillage. Inject as much volume as it takes to completely wash out the initially added ddH2O.Aquire xyt frames over at least 30 min.[Optional] Wash out the first test substance, wash the chamber once with ddH2O and repeat the injection using a new, prefilled Heidelberger extension. Take up excess volume at the drainage port using absorbent paper (e.g., Whatman paper).For data analysis, open xyt stacks with ImageJ.To obtain the FEVs of each channel over time mark and measure fluorescence intensities in one or more custom-shaped regions of interest using the ‘ROI manager’ tool and ‘measure stacks’ plugin. Calculate the 488 nm/405 nm ratio (as similar as equation 1) and plot it on the y-axis against the acquisition time on the x-axis.For visual representation of the 488 nm/405 nm ratio follow the instructions (link[href=http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v6/n12/images_article/nprot.2011.395-F4.jpg]) of Kardash et al. (2011). Figure 5 shows exemplarily a 488 nm/405 nm false color ratio image of a hypha. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161215/20161215222640_5140.jpgFigure 5.
