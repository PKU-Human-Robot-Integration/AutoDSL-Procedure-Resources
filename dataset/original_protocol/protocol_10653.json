    "1. Preparation of Abdominal Ganglia, Electrophysiological Measurements, and Isolation of Single Identified Neurons from Abdominal Ganglion of Aplysia californica\nMaintain Aplysia in the laboratory aquarium with circulating artificial seawater (ASW) at 16 °C under 12:12 light:dark conditions.\nIsolation of abdominal ganglion.\n\t\nAnesthetize animals by injecting 380 mM MgCl2 solution for 5-10 min (equivalent to 30-35% of the animal's body weight).\nIdentify the abdominal ganglion based on its position in the central nervous system24,28.\nRemove the ganglia by surgical operation and immediately store in artificial seawater consisting of 450 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 55 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM NaHCO3, and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4).\nProtease treatment.\n\t\nIncubate abdominal ganglion for 30 min at 34 °C±0.5  in a Petri dish with 0.1% protease (dispase) diluted in ASW described above.\n\t\tNOTE: The amount of the protease used needs to be standardized with the age and weight of the animals. In general, older and bigger animals would require more protease.\nRemoval of ganglia sheath.\n\t\nAfter the enzyme treatment, pin down the ganglia to the Sylgard Silicone base of a cell chamber (Ø= 1 cm; vol. = 0.3 ml) and perfuse with ASW (flow rate: 150 μl/min) at room temperature (18 °C±2 ).\n\t\tNOTE: In order to increase the visibility of identified neurons, place the ganglion on the top of a polycarbonate glass cylinder (Figure 1) (diameter Ø= 2 mm modified cell chamber) that can be easily illuminated from the bottom using a binocular stereomicroscope with 20X and 40X magnification.\nCarefully remove the sheath from the ganglion by using forceps and microscissors.\nSimultaneous electrophysiological recording from two neurons.\n\t\nIdentify neuron of interest.\nImpale the neuron with a single intracellular sharp microelectrode with resistance 10-15 MΩ filled with 3 M KCl solution.",
    "Record neuronal activity (10 kHz band pass) using an intracellular recording system.\nProcess the recording data using electrophysiology software such as Axograph.\n\t\tNOTE: One can easily carry out recording from multiple neurons. Neurons L7, L11 or R15 and R2 are easily identified based on their position. Two amplifiers and two micromanipulators are required for simultaneously recording from two L7 and R15 neurons (Figure 2).\nDrug application.\n\t\nApply drug of choice into the cell chamber by gentle pipetting or inject directly into neurons.\nCarry out electrophysiological measurements.\n\t\tNOTE: Depending on the experimental objective, one could measure different electrophysiological parameters of neurons such as the changes in membrane potential (MP) or action potential (AP) before, during and after the drug application.\nIsolation of single neurons.\n\t\nAt the conclusion of the electrophysiological experiments, stop the perfusion of ASW and wash the ganglion with 100% ethanol.  Exposure to ethanol will petrify the neurons and, using fine forceps, make it easy to remove individual neurons without damaging other neurons from the ganglion.\nRemove single neurons under a stereomicroscope and transfer to a small Eppendorf tube containing ice cold 500 μl RNA extraction reagent. Isolated single neurons can be stored in RNA extraction reagent at -80 °C for future analysis.\n2. RNA Isolation from Single Neurons and Gene Expression Analysis by Quantitative Real Time PCR (qPCR)\nPrecautions to minimize RNA degradation:\n\tRibonucleases (RNases) degrade RNA and are very stable and active enzymes. Take the following steps during handling RNAs.\n\t\nClean the working area and instruments with RNase deactivating agents.\nWear gloves at all times while handling RNA and change gloves often.\nUse only RNase free plastics to handle RNAs.\nIsolating Total RNA from Single neurons:",
    "Standard Trizol protocol for RNA isolation can be used to isolate RNAs from single neurons. Briefly add 20% v/v of chloroform to Trizol, mix well by brief vortexing.\nPlace the tubes on rotator for 10 min at 4 °C. Spin the Trizol-Chloroform mix at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.\nCollect the aqueous phase and transfer to a fresh tube.\nAdd sodium acetate solution (pH 5.5) to a final concentration of 0.3 M, 100 ng/ml of the coprecipitant GlycoBlue, and 2.5 volumes of 100% ethanol to precipitate RNA.\nMix the samples well and incubate at -80 °C overnight.\nSpin the samples at 12,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C and a small blue pellet will be visible at the bottom of the tube.\nRemove the supernatant and wash the pellet with 850 μl of 75% ice-cold ethanol at 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\nRemove the supernatant carefully and air-dry the RNA pellet for 7-10 min, maximum.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure that RNA is not left for long to dry as over-drying the RNA pellet makes solubilization very difficult.\nOnce dried, resuspend the RNA pellet in 10 μl of RNAse free water and determine RNA concentration.\n\t\tNOTE: Determine RNA concentration using a spectrophotometer. When not using right away, store RNA at -80 °C.\naRNA synthesis from single neurons:\n\t\nAmplify the RNA (one or two rounds depending on experimental objective) using commercially available linear RNA amplification system.\n\t\tNOTE: The total RNA from single neurons ranged from ~10-60 ng. Expected yield of first round of amplification is ~100-300 ng and the second round of amplification is ~0.8-1.5 μg of RNA.\nReverse transcription of RNA:",
    "To generate cDNA from aRNA, use 1.0 μg of aRNA in 20 μl of a reverse transcription reaction. Several kits are commercially available for this purpose.\n\t\tNOTE: cDNA was synthesized according to the manufacturer's protocol using the following settings on thermal cycler.\n\t\t5 min at 25 °C\n\t\t30 min at 42 °C\n\t\t5 min at 85 °C\n\t\tHold at 4 °C\nAfter the reverse transcription step, store the cDNA at -20 °C for long-term storage.\nPrimer design and standardization:\n\tSeveral excellent software programs are available, free of charge, for designing primers for real time amplifications.\n\t\nSelect 18-24 mer oligonucleotides that produce 70-110 bp amplicons and synthesize the primers using commercial sources.\n\t\tNOTE: Two to three primer pairs should be designed for each gene of interest. Each primer set needs to standardized by qPCR. The forward and reverse primer pairs that were used for gene CREB1 (Figure 4) are below:\n\t\tPrimer set 1\n\t\tForward: 5'-TGATTCTGACGCAAAGAAAAGA-3'\n\t\tReverse: 5'-ACCGTGAGCAGTCAGTTGTAGA-3'\n\t\tPrimer set 2\n\t\tForward: 5'-AGGGAATGTCGATGAAAGAAGA-3'\n\t\tReverse: 5'-GACACACAGGAAGTATGCCAAA-3'\nTo select the best primer to be used for the downstream analyses, monitor Ct value and the shape of the amplification curve in qPCR.\n\t\tNOTE: Primers that give Ct (Cycle threshold) values between 10-35 in the 40 round amplification and smooth curves during the exponential phase of the PCR followed by a smooth plateau are optimal for gene expression analyses.\nQuantitative Real Time PCR (qPCR):\n\tNote: Use appropriate tubes or plates that are compatible with the qPCR machine.\n\t\nDilute cDNA to 5x with nuclease free water.\nTo 2 μl of diluted cDNA, add 8 μl of a qPCR master mix containing 2 μl of H2O, 5 μl of 2x SYBR Green master mix, and 1.0 μl of 10 μM (each) forward and reverse primer.",
    "Close the tubes and seal the plate after pipetting cDNA and master mix. Mix the contents by gentle tapping and spinning down at 1,500 rpm for 30 sec.\nProceed to setting up the qPCR machine.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
