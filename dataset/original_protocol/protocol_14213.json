    "1. Prepare the Workstation and Materials\nAdhere to all laboratory safety rules. Wear eye protection and gloves. Read the material safety data sheet for each of the reagents used and take appropriate precautions. Review the materials and equipment list, chemical handling procedures, and glassware precautions.\n\tCaution: This protocol requires the use of a hotplate at high temperatures. Use caution and wear heat resistant gloves when interacting with hot containers and do not touch the surface of the hotplate.\nClear the workspace and clean the surfaces with disinfectant. Wash your hands and put gloves on.\nSterilize all instruments and the inside of all glass jars to reduce the potential risk of contamination and increase the longevity of the phantom.\n\tNOTE: If the phantom will be used for more than a couple of days, periodically clean the surface of the completed phantom with ethanol to prevent bacterial growth.\n2. Prepare the Water Solution\nPrepare the workspace for the water solution. Position the following materials and equipment on the bench: graduated cylinder, 400 mL beaker, stir bar, scale, 2x weigh boats, spatula, 2x 1.0 mL syringes with needle, distilled water, gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentacetate (DTPA) contrast agent, water-soluble surfactant, agar, and sodium benzoate.\n\tNOTE: Syringes can be used with or without needles. However, using needles will improve the accuracy of the measurement and help prevent splatter when the contents are being added to the water or oil solutions.\nPlace a stir bar into a 400 mL beaker. Use a 100 or 200 mL graduated cylinder to measure 300 mL of distilled water and pour the water into the beaker. Place the beaker on the hotplate and set at 90 °C with a stir rate of 100 rpm.",
    "NOTE: High temperatures are used in this protocol to achieve quick results. Because the solutions are not left on the hotplate for long periods of time, the set-point temperature for the hotplate does not reflect the temperature of the solution.\nUse a calibrated scale to measure 0.30 g of sodium benzoate into a weigh boat. Add sodium benzoate to the water solution.\nUse a syringe to measure 0.6 mL of the water-soluble surfactant. Make sure that there are no air bubbles. Hold the needle a few millimeters over the center of the solution, and slowly release the water-soluble surfactant to avoid splatter on the walls of the beaker.\nUsing a clean syringe, measure 0.24 mL of the gadolinium-DTPA contrast agent. Add it to the beaker, using the same technique as in step 2.4.\n\tNOTE: Gadolinium-DTPA is used to adjust the phantom's MRI relaxation properties to match those of the tissue of interest. The reader can adjust the volume of added gadolinium-DTPA to better match the relaxation properties of the tissue of interest.\nMeasure 9.0 g of agar into a weigh boat. Slowly spoon the agar with a spatula into the beaker with water.\nOnce everything has been added to the water solution, increase the hotplate temperature to 350 °C and stir bar speed to 1100 rpm for 5-10 min to melt the agar.\n\t\nTo check if the agar is melted, briefly remove the water solution from the hotplate, stop stirring, and check the color of the solution. Melted agar should be clear (no streamers or clumps) and yellow or amber in color.",
    "Once the agar is fully melted, use a syringe or pour about 3.5 mL of the water solution into a small vial. If the test solution does not set or separates after 5-10 min, the agar is not melted. Increase the hotplate temperature back to 350 °C and continue heating the solution.\nRepeat step 2.8 until water solution in the test vial sets properly.\nLeave the water solution on the hotplate at 50 °C and 100 rpm. Clean the work space and prepare for the oil solution.\n\t\nRemove the following materials from the bench: scale, 2x weigh boats, spatula, 2x 1.0 mL syringes with needle (used), distilled water, gadolinium-DTPA contrast agent, water-soluble surfactant, agar, and sodium benzoate.\nPosition the following materials and equipment on the bench: 400 mL beaker (clean), stir bar (clean), 2.0 mL syringe with needle, peanut oil, and oil-soluble surfactant.\n3. Oil Solution\nPlace a new stir bar into a clean 400 mL beaker. Use a graduated cylinder to measure 300 mL of peanut oil and pour into the beaker. Remove the beaker containing the water solution and place the oil solution beaker on the hotplate. Set to 90 °C with a stir rate of 100 rpm for 1 min.\n\tNOTE: Peanut oil is used because it has a similar nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum compared to triglycerides in human adipose tissue15.\n\t\nDo not leave the oil on the hotplate unattended. If the oil gets too hot and begins to smoke, remove it from the hotplate and reduce the temperature before returning the oil to the hotplate.",
    "Measure 3.0 mL of the oil-soluble surfactant with a clean syringe. Using the same technique described in step 2.4, add the oil-soluble surfactant to the beaker. Set the hotplate to 150 °C and 1100 rpm for 5 min to fully mix the oil solution.\nTake the oil solution off the hotplate and clean the workspace in preparation for creating the phantom.\n\t\nRemove the following materials from the bench: 2.0 mL syringe with needle (used), peanut oil, and oil-soluble surfactant.\nPosition the following materials and equipment on the bench: 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask, stir bar (clean), volumetric pipettes, volumetric pipette holder, and 5x 120 mL glass jars.\n4. Create Phantom Emulsion\nPrepare volumetric pipettes for the water and oil solutions. Pipettes should only be used with their respective solution to prevent cross-contamination.\n\t\nMatch the size of the pipette to the volume being used in the protocol. For example, use 2x 50 mL volumetric pipettes (50 mL water solution + 50 mL oil solution) to create a 100 mL phantom with a target FF of 50% fat.\nPlace the water solution on the hotplate and set the hotplate to 300 °C and 1100 rpm. After 4-5 min, turn the stirrer off.\nUsing a volumetric pipette, check if the water solution is ready for extraction by partially filling the pipette with a small amount (5-10 mL) of the solution and releasing back into the beaker. If the water solution can be easily removed and released without excessive remnants in the pipette, move on to next step, otherwise, leave it on the hotplate and check again in 2-3 min.",
    "NOTE: The components of the water solution are more susceptible to setting and separating, so it is best to keep the water solution stirring and/or warm as often as possible. If the water solution is not warmed and stirred before transferring, it will be very difficult to measure accurate volumes due to the tendency of agar to congeal when cooled.\nCarefully add a clean stir bar to a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask. Take the water solution off the hotplate, measure the proper volume (Table 2), and transfer it to the Erlenmeyer flask.\nPlace the oil solution on the hotplate and set at 90 °C and 1100 rpm to ensure the solution is homogeneous. After 1-2 min, remove the oil solution from the hotplate and replace it with the Erlenmeyer flask.\nMeasure proper amount of the oil solution (Table 2) and slowly add to the water solution in the Erlenmeyer flask.\nOnce all oil solution has been added, increase the temperature to 300 °C and maintain the stirring at 1100 rpm. Stir the combined solutions for 4-5 min (there should be vortex from the stir bar). The emulsion should be white, with a creamy texture.\nUse a magnetic stir bar retriever to remove the stir bar.\n\tNOTE: The stir bar retriever should be used to remove the stir bars from all future emulsions. Clean it thoroughly between each use.\nUse heat resistant gloves to carefully pour the mixture in the Erlenmeyer flask into a clean 120 mL glass jar. Slowly pour the mixture down the side of the glass jar to prevent bubbles in the mixture as it cools.\nClean the Erlenmeyer flask and stir bar, then repeat steps 4.2-4.8, adjusting the amounts of water and oil solutions, until all phantoms are created.",
