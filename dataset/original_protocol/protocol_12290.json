    "1. Differentiation of Human ESC towards the Definitive Endoderm\nCultivate human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nCoat a new 6-well cell culture plate with 1 ml of a basement membrane matrix and incubate the culture-ware for at least 30 min at RT. For specific details please turn to the respective manufacturer's instructions.\nConfirm that the cultured human ESCs have reached 80%-90% confluency under the microscope using a low magnification (e.g., 4X). Aspirate the medium from the cavities by sucking off the medium with a sterile glass Pasteur pipet. Wash the cells once with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution. For this, add 2 ml PBS to each well softly shake the plate and suck off the solution to remove dead cells and cell debris.\nAdd 1 ml of enzyme-free passaging solution reagent for gentle dissociation of cell clusters. Incubate the cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until the cells show clear signs of disruption into small clusters.\nNOTE: The incubation time depends on the reagent used. For the enzyme-free passaging solution mentioned in the materials section, incubation time is roughly 7 min.\nAdd 1 ml DMEM/F-12 medium and disrupt the remaining cell aggregates into single cells by pipetting up and down using a 1 ml pipette tip. Use this to flush the cells from the surface and transfer the cells to a centrifugation tube. To retrieve all cells, wash each well with 1 ml of DMEM/F-12 medium and add the medium to the centrifugation tube.\nCentrifuge the cells for 5 min at 300 x g. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 5 ml ES cell culture medium containing 10 µM Rho-Kinase (ROCK) inhibitor.",
    "Count the cells under the microscope using a hemocytometer and seed 150,000 - 400,000 cells per 6-well or in another plate layout, depending on the ES cell line used. Use culture medium containing 10 µM ROCK inhibitor to avoid apoptosis and culture the cells in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nApproximately 24 hr after seeding aspirate the medium with a sterile glass Pasteur pipet and add 2 ml of primitive streak induction medium.\nNOTE: This medium contains final concentrations of 1% glutamine, 0.2% FCS, 5 µM CHIR-99021 and 50 ng/ml activin A in Advanced RPMI-1640 medium. Commonly, use 2 ml of medium for cultivation in 6-well plates.\n48 hr after seeding, replace the medium to endoderm induction medium. Cultivate the cells in this medium for another 48 hr with daily medium change.\nNOTE: This medium contains 1% glutamine, 0.2% FCS and 50 ng/ml activin A in Advanced RPMI-1640 medium. Cells that are committed towards the definitive endoderm express the surface marker CXCR4. The staining of CXCR4 can be used to quantify the number of DE-committed cells.\n2. Staining of CXCR4+ Definitive Endoderm Cells for Flow Cytometry Analysis\nFor the final 24 hr but at least 1 hr before harvesting the cells add 10 µM ROCK inhibitor to the culture medium.\nCoat the cell culture-ware that will be used for re-seeding with a basement membrane matrix, i.e., 12-well plates for qPCR analysis or chamber slides for immunofluorescence staining. Incubate the plates or slides for at least 30 min at RT.\nAspirate the medium with a sterile glass Pasteur pipet from the wells of the differentiated cells used for staining and/or sorting.",
    "Add 1 ml of enzyme-free passaging solution reagent for the gentle dissociation of cell clusters. Incubate the cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until the cells show clear signs of disruption into small clusters.\nNOTE: The incubation time depends on the reagent used. For the enzyme-free passaging solution mentioned in the materials section, incubation time is roughly 7 min.\nAdd 1 ml DMEM/F-12 medium and disrupt remaining cell aggregates into single cells by pipetting up and down using a 1 ml tip. Use this to flush the cells from the surface and transfer the cells to a centrifugation tube. To retrieve all cells, wash each well with 1 ml of DMEM/F-12 medium w/o FCS and add the medium to the centrifugation tube.\nCount the cells under the microscope using a hemocytometer. Cells from three wells of a 6-well plate should result in 10-15 x 106 cells after three days of differentiation. Centrifuge the cells for 5 min at 300 x g.\nNOTE: The exact number of obtained cells will depend on the pluripotent cell line used for the differentiation.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in PEB buffer containing 10 µM ROCK inhibitor. Use 100 µl of this buffer for up to 107 cells. Add the 10 µM ROCK inhibitor on the day of staining. Use this buffer for all downstream applications (referred to as PEB buffer + RI).\nNOTE: PEB buffer contains 0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA in PBS. If more cells are to be stained, adjust the buffer volume accordingly.\nAdd 10 µl of a CXCR4-APC antibody per 107 cells in 100 µl, this roughly represents a dilution of 1:10.",
    "NOTE: The usage of an APC-linked antibody is not mandatory. Instead it can be substituted depending on the microbeads used. If more cells are to be stained adjust the antibody volume accordingly.\nMix by gently flipping the tube with the fingers and incubate at 4 °C in a refrigerator for 15 min. Resuspend the cells with 1-2 ml PEB buffer. Centrifuge the cells for 5 min at 300 x g.\nAspirate the supernatant with a sterile glass Pasteur pipet and resuspend the cell pellet in 80 µl PEB per 107 cells and add 20 µl anti-APC microbeads.\nNOTE: If more cells are to be stained, adjust the micro-bead volume accordingly.\nMix by gently flipping the tube with the fingers and incubate at 4 °C in a refrigerator for 15 min. Resuspend the cells with 1-2 ml PEB buffer + RI. Centrifuge the cells for 5 min at 300 x g. Aspirate the buffer. Resuspend in 500 µl PEB buffer + RI.\n3. Magnetic Separation of CXCR4+ Cells\nPlace a medium sized magnetic column in a magnetic field as per manufacture instructions. Pre-rinse the column with 500 µl PEB buffer +RI. Apply the entire cell suspension to the column. Collect the flow through as not all cells will bind to the column. Make sure not to disturb the columns for optimal retrieval of CXCR4+ cells.\nWash the column three times with 500 µl PEB buffer + RI. Collect the first flow through and combine it with the collected cells from Step 3.1. Remove the magnetic column from the magnetic field and place it in a suitable collection tube. Add 1 ml PEB buffer + RI onto the column. To elute the cells firmly press down the plunger into the column.",
    "Optional: Collect all flow through samples separately and use 20 µl each to analyze the number of CXCR4+ cells using flow cytometry. Their number should decline with every washing step.\nNOTE: At least 2 x 104 viable, gated cells should be counted for reliable results.\nRepeat Steps 3.1-3.3 with the collected-flow through sample from Step 3.1 and the first flow through sample from step 3.2 using a new column. Do not re-use the previous column. By using the plunger air is pressed into the column, which blocks it.\nCount the cells under the microscope using a hemocytometer. Depending on the efficiency of the differentiation up to 6 x 106 cells can be sorted initially and another 1 x 106 cells by using a second column when using 107 cells for the procedure.\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 min. Aspirate the supernatant and with a sterile glass Pasteur pipet and resuspend the cells in 1 ml endoderm induction medium from Step 1.9 with additional 10 µM ROCK inhibitor.\nCount the cells under the microscope using a hemocytometer. Seed the cells at an appropriate density, i.e., ~ 4 x 105 cells per well of a 12-well plate (app. 3.6 cm2 surface) or ~ 1.5 x 105 cells per well of an 8-well chamber-slide.\n4. Optional: Analysis of Purified Definitive Endoderm Population\nFor immunofluorescence staining fix the purified cells from Step 3.7 roughly 24 hr after seeding with 4% paraformaldehyde and stain for definitive endoderm (DE) and/or pluripotency marker proteins.\nNOTE: Commonly used DE markers include FOXA2 and SOX17, commonly used pluripotency markers include OCT3/4, NANOG and SOX26, 8.",
    "For RT-qPCR analysis, harvest the purified cells directly or 24 hr after seeding, extract total-RNA and reverse transcribe cDNA from the extracted total-RNA samples. Use 10 ng cDNA as template per RT-qPCR reaction (triplicates) to analyze the expression of DE and pluripotency marker genes6, 8.\nNOTE: Commonly used marker genes are mentioned in Step 4.1. Cycle conditions are 5 min at 95 °C and 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C, followed by melting curve analysis.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
