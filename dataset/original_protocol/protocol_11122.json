    "1. Preparation\nNOTE: The measurement method proposed herein utilizes a simplified marker set consisting of twelve markers, as outlined below. The entire measurement process, including preparation, can be performed within 20 min. The feasibility of this protocol in real clinical settings has been verified in previous studies13,14,15,16,17.\nPerform the calibration process according to manufacturer's protocol.\nInstruct patients to wear easy fit, skintight legwear, and place the colored markers on the patient, as outlined below.\n\t\nPlace markers (30 mm in diameter) at the following points on the patient's body: both acromia, hips (at points one-third of the way from the greater trochanter of the femur along a line joining each anterior superior iliac spine with each greater trochanter), knees (on the midline of the anterior-posterior diameter of each lateral epicondyle of the femur), ankles (lateral malleoli), toes (fifth metatarsal heads), and iliac crests (at the position of each iliac crest on a vertical line passing through the hips).\n2. Measurement\nSet the speed of treadmill and measure gait patterns.\n\t\nInstruct the patient to perform the 10 m walk test.\nSet a subjectively comfortable gait speed. Set the treadmill speed, starting at 70% of the over ground gait and gradually increasing the speed, to find the comfortable gait speed on the treadmill.\nMeasure walking. For a single session it takes 20 s. If the different conditions (e.g. gait speed, orthosis etc.) need to be compared, perform several sessions. In that case, have patients rest for 1 minute between the sessions.\n\t\tNOTE: Although 3DGA systems with infrared cameras are commonly used in 3DGA research, a video-based simplified motion analysis system (sampling frequency: 60 Hz; e.g., Kinematracer) is used in this protocol to shorten the calibration process.\n3. Data Analysis\nTime-distance Factors",
    "NOTE: Time-distance parameters are common and basic parameters used in gait analysis studies. Events of foot initial contact and foot-off are determined automatically by the system based on toe and ankle marker trajectories.\n\t\nTo avoid errors in step detection, have two experienced physical therapists verify the accuracy of timing and adjust it if there are errors in step timing.\nFrom these detected step timings, calculate the following:\nCalculate Cadence (steps/min) = 60 × 2 / SC (s)\nCalculate Stride length (m) = GS (m/s) × SC (s) + (The displacement of ankle marker from foot contact to foot contact of the same side)\nCalculate Step length (m) = GS (m/s) × (The time from foot contact of one side to foot contact of the other side) + (The average difference in the ankle position at foot contact of one side and the other side)\nCalculate Step width (m) = The average lateral distance between both ankle markers during double stance phase\nCalculate Duration of double stance: The sum of double stance phase that appears twice during a gait cycle; the time between foot contact of one side and subsequent foot off on the other side.\nCalculate Duration of single stance: The average time between foot off and subsequent foot contact on the opposite side.\n\t\tNOTE: SC (Step cycle): The average time from heel contact of one side to heel contact of the same side. **GS (Gait speed)\nLissajous Overview Picture (LOP)\n\tNOTE: LOPs are designed as a figure consisting of marker joint trajectories on major joints with the aim of facilitating understanding rehabilitation patients' holistic gait patterns14 (see Figure 1).",
    "Generate LOPs from trajectories at the coordinates of ten markers and the virtual center of gravity (COG) in the horizontal (x-y), sagittal (y-z), and coronal (z-x) planes (x: left/right, y: anterior/posterior, z: superior/inferior).\n\t\t\nDraw the LOP with the software or by constructing a scatterplot that covers the motion range of all the markers on a spreadsheet software. Calculate the virtual COG by hypothesizing each body segment to be as follows: trunk, 0.66; thigh, 0.1; lower thigh, 0.05; and foot, 0.02. Subsequently, calculate COG as the composition center of the segments.\nAt each marker, extract raw data for the three components (x, y, and z) for each gait cycle, normalize these by gait cycle, and average the values. Set mean values of the x- and y-components of the virtual COG to 0 and use these as references for the x- and y-components of the markers.\nCalculation of Abnormal Gait Index for Hemiparetic Gait\n\tNOTE: Several common gait patterns are known to be features of hemiparetic gait after stroke. These include hip hiking, circumduction, and lateral shift of the trunk18. Indices for abnormal gait patterns have been developed to quantify the extent of these gait patterns13,16,17. To date, ten abnormal gait indices (hip hiking, circumduction, forefoot contact, retropulsion of the hip, excessive hip external rotation, excessive lateral shift of the trunk over the unaffected side, knee extensor thrust, flexed-knee gait, insufficient knee flexion during the swing phase and medial whip) have been reported. The formula for each index is shown in Table 1.",
    "Calculate the raw value of the indices according to the formulas. For example, calculate the raw value of the index for hip hiking as the difference between the maximum value of the z-coordinate of the hip joint marker during the swing phase and the concurrent z-coordinate of the contralateral hip joint marker, corrected for the mean left-right difference of the z-coordinate during the double support phase.\nCalculate the deviation score (t-score) based on measurement data of healthy subjects. Calculate the standardized score as follows: T = 50 + 10 × (X−µ) / δ (T: deviation score; X: individual data; µ: mean raw value of the healthy subjects; δ: standard deviation).\nAnalysis of Toe Clearance Strategy\n\tNOTE: Strategies for toe clearance during swing vary greatly between healthy subjects and patients with lower limb paresis. In healthy subjects, toe clearance is achieved by limb shortening, with minimal movements of the pelvis or trunk. On the other hand, patients with paresis cannot shorten their limbs to the same extent. For these patients, the resulting compensatory strategies such as pelvic tilt or circumduction also affect toe clearance19. In this analysis, the height of toe clearance at mid-swing is divided into two parts: the vertical gain achieved by limb shortening and that gained by compensatory movements, which directly affect toe clearance. The components that comprise toe clearance (vertical component of limb shortening, pelvic obliquity, hip abduction, and vaulting) are calculated as outlined below.\n\t\nCalculate total toe clearance from the z-coordinate of the fifth metatarsal head as an index of toe clearance.\nCalculate the vertical component of limb shortening as the z-coordinate of the change in the distance between the hip and the fifth metatarsal head.\nCalculate the vertical component of compensatory movement by summing three subcomponents, as follows.",
    "Calculate the vertical component of pelvic obliquity as the difference in height (z-coordinate) of hip markers.\nCalculate the vertical component of hip abduction as the distance between the hip and the fifth metatarsal head and the abduction angles. This reflects the upward distance that the foot would have moved as a result of hip abduction if there had been no change in lower limb length.\nCalculate the vertical component of vaulting from the change in z-coordinate of the contralateral hip between mid-stance and mid-swing20."
