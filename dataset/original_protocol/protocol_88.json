    "**Preparation of the cell lysates**\n1. Centrifuge the positive and negative cell lysates, each at 17,500 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Discard the pellets.\n  \n2. Divide the supernatants from step 1 \\(the soluble fractions of the cell lysates) into 10 µL aliquots and store at -80 °C.\n  \n3. Perform SDS-PAGE with the positive cell lysate to ensure that the target protein is in the soluble fraction.\n    \n4. Using the BCA protein assay kit, measure the total protein concentration in both the positive and the negative cell lysates, following the manufacturer’s instructions. \n  \n**PAUSE POINT** The cell lysates should be stored at -80 °C for up to two months.\n**Capillary preconditioning and library preparation**\n5. Rinse every new capillary with approximately four capillary volumes of each of the capillary rinsing solutions: 100 mM HCl, 100 mM NaOH, ddH<sub>2</sub>O and RB. Maintain the order of rinsing solutions as listed. Repeat these steps immediately before and after every CE run.\n  \n6. Prepare 10 µL of 500 µM naive DNA library in SB. Heat the mixture in a thermal cycler to 94 °C and cool down to 20 °C at a rate of 0.5 °C per s. In future steps, when preparing equilibrium mixtures, treat all the DNA library samples and DNA aptamer samples in this manner.  \n  \n7. Prepare a 100 µM solution of the temperature-treated DNA library \\(from step 6) in 100 µL SB.\n  \n**Determination of library and fluorescein migration times**\n8. Prepare a 10 µL sample of equilibrium mixture with the following components: 10 µM of DNA library and 100 µM of each of the masking DNAs. Incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature.",
    "9. Inject 150 nL of the mixture from step 8 into the capillary and perform NECEEM in RB at 375 V cm<sup>–1</sup> \\(normal polarity and positive electrode at the injection end). Usually, 60 min is sufficient to observe the free DNA component. See troubleshooting.\n  \n10. Determine the migration time of the DNA library to the end of the capillary. This is the migration time of the free DNA component of the equilibrium mixture.\n  \n11. As described in step 9, perform NECEEM with the same equilibrium mixture, but with added 100 nM of fluorescein. Fluorescein will act as the collection window migration marker.\n  \n12.

Incubate each mixture for 10 minutes at room temperature before performing NECEEM analysis as described in step 9. Observe the effect of varying masking DNA concentrations on the lysate peaks. Select the lowest masking DNA concentration that has a significant suppressing effect on these peaks. While full suppression is desirable, do not increase the concentration of the masking DNAs above 10 mM.\n  \n**Positive Selection**\n16. Before rinsing the capillary as described in step 5, rinse it with 4 capillary volumes of RNase-AWAY solution.\n  \n17.

Collect the eluent from the beginning of CE run, to the elution of the fluorescein peak. At this point, briefly pause the electric current, switch the outlet of the capillary into an outlet containing RB, and continue the electric current. Stop the separation after the free DNA component of the equilibrium mixture elutes. Collection window is illustrated in figure 2.\n  \n19.  Incubate the collected fraction for 15 min at room temperature.\n  \n**Negative Selection**\n20.

Real-time PCR produces an S-shaped amplification curve \\(product yield versus number of cycles). Determine how many cycles are required for the reaction mixture to generate the product at a level of 50–60% of the maximum. This is the number of cycles required to generate the optimal amount of amplified library product in the subsequent preparative PCR.\n  \n**Preparative PCR**\n26. Set up 40 µL amplification reaction mixture for the fraction collected in step 22, with the components as described in table 3.\n  \n**Table 3:** Contents of the preparative PCR amplification reaction mixture\n• 10x PCR buffer - **4 µL**\n• FAM-Forward primer \\(10 µM) - **1.2 µL \\(to 300 nM)**\n• Biotin-Reverse primer \\(10 µM) - **1.2 µL \\(to 300 nM)**\n• dNTPs \\(10 mM) - **0.8 µL \\(to 200 nM)**\n• Taq DNA polymerase \\(5 units mL<sup>-1</sup>) - **0.4 µL \\(to 0.05 units mL<sup>-1</sup>)**\n• Template - **2 µL**\n• ddH2O - **30.4 µL**\n27. In addition to the sample from step 26, set up a 40 µL control mixture, with the components as described in table 3, but with ddH<sub>2</sub>O instead of the template.\n  \n28. Amplify the samples from steps 26 and 27 using the PCR program detailed in table 4. There is no need to measure the fluorescence signal from this reaction.

Transfer 5 µL of each of the amplification products from step 27 into new sample tubes. Precondition a 50-cm capillary as described in step 5. Using this 50-cm capillary, perform NECEEM on each of the samples, as described in step 9. The electropherogram for the control sample should contain only a single peak, representing the labeled primer, while the sample from step 26 should also have a second smaller peak, representing the double-stranded DNA amplification product. The presence of the double-stranded DNA peak will confirm the efficiency of the PCR amplification step. \n  \n**Asymmetric PCR** \n30.

After each wash, remove the beads from the solution with a magnetic bead separator.",
    "33.  Mix 40 µL of PCR-amplified samples from step 28 with 40 µL BWB.\n  \n34. Resuspend the beads from step 32 in the sample solutions from step 33, and gently mix. Incubate at room temperature for 20 min, gently mixing every five min to facilitate faster binding of DNA to the beads.\n  \n35.  Pull down the beads from the solution using a magnetic separator and collect the supernatant. Load the supernatant on to the molecular cut-off filters. Discard the beads.\n  \n36. Centrifuge the molecular cut-off filters with the supernatant from step 35, at 7,000 × g for 20 minutes at 15° C.\n  \n37. Load 200 µL of SB on to the filter and repeat step 36.

Prepare the following dilutions of the FAM-Forward primer: 50nM, 200 nM, 500nM and 1 µM. \n  \n42. Perform NECEEM as described in step 9 with each of the dilutions of the FAM-labeled primer. Plot the heights of the produced peaks against primer concentrations to obtain a standard curve. Using the standard curve and the peak height from step 41 roughly approximate the concentration of the aptamer pool. \n  \n**Affinity analysis of aptamer pools**",
    "43. Use temperature treatment, as described in step 6, on 5 µL of aptamer pool from step 40.\n  \n44. Prepare a 5 µL equilibrium mixture with the following components: 1 µL of aptamer pool from step 43, 20 µg mL<sup>-1</sup> of positive cell lysate, 100 nM of fluorescein, and the concentration of masking DNAs as used in step 15. Incubate for 10 min at room temperature.\n  \n45.  Use a 50-cm capillary for the following CE run. Rinse the capillary as described in step 5.\n  \n46. Inject 50 nL of the equilibrium mixture from step 44 into the capillary and run NECEEM in RB at 375 V cm<sup>–1</sup> \\(normal polarity and positive electrode at the injection end).",
    "47. Compare the resultant electropherogram to the one produced in step 12. Any peak, or peaks, that increase in area should be suspected to correspond to complexes between the target protein and the DNA aptamers. Using equation 1, calculate the bulk EC<sub>50</sub> value of the aptamer pool to the target in using the combined areas of the suspected peaks. In equation 1, \\[T]<sub>tot</sub> and \\[DNA]<sub>tot</sub> are the total concentrations of the target and DNA, respectively; A<sub>1</sub> is the area of the peak of free DNA divided by the migration time of free DNA, A<sub>2</sub> is the area of the peak of DNA that dissociated from the complex during NECEEM divided by the migration time of free DNA and A<sub>3</sub> is the area of the peak of the intact complex that reached the detector divided by the migration time of the complex. EC<sub>50</sub> is a measure of an effective abundance of aptamers in the library, which is used for qualitatively monitoring the progress of selection — a decrease of this value throughout the steps of partitioning indicates that the selection is progressing. The division of areas by corresponding migration times is performed to ensure that peak areas are proportional to the amounts of the species. This procedure is necessary for CE instruments with the on-column detection mode only. For CE instruments with past-column detection, normalization by time is not required.

    "48. Subsequent rounds of aptamer selection should be repeated in the same manner as described above in steps 16 to step 47. Some modifications are as follows: In all steps where the original DNA library is used, it should be substituted with the aptamer pool obtained in the previous round. In all equilibrium mixtures add the DNA aptamer pool to a final concentration of approximately 100-200 nM. To maintain the ratio between aptamer DNA and masking DNA, reduce the concentration of the masking DNAs by 50 times.\n  \n49. When the peaks suspected to represent the complex between aptamers and the target protein become distinguishable, narrow down the collection window around these peaks. \n  \n50. Repeat aptamer selection rounds until the pool displays the desired EC<sub>50</sub> value, or until no improvements to are observed for three consecutive rounds. See troubleshooting.\n  \n**Aptamer pool biotinylation**\n51.
