    "**Cell preparation**\n● Timing: days 1–3\n1| Add 100 μL of 1 μg/mL human fibronectin in D-PBS on a 3-µm porous PET membrane surface in a 12-well culture plate for 30 min at room temperature.\n2| Remove fibronectin.\n3| Seed 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> MDA-MB-231 cells/well in 700 μL of L-15 complete medium in the upper chamber of the 12-well culture plate with fibronectin-coated porous membranes; the bottom chamber is filled with 700 μL of NIH3T3-conditioned medium. Culture the cells for two days at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\n4| Wash the cells on the porous membrane three times gently with D-PBS.\n5| Remove D-PBS using a pipette and cotton swab without touching the cells. You can now proceed to cell body ablation with the excimer laser using the following protocol.\n**Excimer laser etching**\n6| In a LASIK system, an argon fluoride \\(ArF) excimer laser \\(193 nm, 10 Hz) passes through laser pulse-shaper optics \\(a pattern mask, collimator lenses, and an image rotator) to be tuned in a Gaussian pattern for LASIK surgery as illustrated in Figure 2.\n7| Tune the pulse configuration in a flat pattern by aligning the lenses so that two adjacent laser pulses partially overlap. In this setting, the cumulative laser intensity is constant at any point in the irradiation area and the ablation pattern is horizontally flat within a circle 10-mm in diameter \\(Figure 2).\n8| Adjust the laser pulse energy to 10–14 mJ and the pulse number to 12 per scan.\n9| Immediately after absorbing D-PBS from the porous membrane, insert with a cotton swab, and place the insert on the irradiation stage of the tuned LASIK system.\n10| Focus the irradiation plane on the surface of the cell monolayer.\n11| Start laser scanning monitoring with a CCD camera with oblique illumination.",
    "12| Stop the laser when the light scattering due to cell bodies disappears \\(record the laser scan number.)\n13| Fix the irradiated membrane with formalin and stain it with hematoxylin and eosin. \n14| Examine the stained membrane for the remaining cell bodies using a light microscope. \n15| Find the minimal laser scan number that provides complete removal of cell bodies \\(18 to 24 scans are required.)\n16| Immediately after complete cell body removal, cut out the irradiated membrane area using a hollow leather punch \\(5 mm in diameter) and quickly freeze it in liquid nitrogen.\nA schematic diagram of laser ablation and protein extraction is presented in Figure 2. In addition, a representative image of the excimer laser scanning of the cells cultured on the porous membrane is provided in Supplementary Video 1.\n17| Store the cut membrane at −80 °C until use.",
    "▲ CRITICAL The total protein concentration in the final sample is too low to be measured using conventional methods such as the Bradford or Lowry assays. Thus, we routinely extract proteins from 100 sheets punched out of the ablated porous membranes and analyze them in triplicate 2D gels. An average spot intensity of three gels is then calculated and spots are subjected to further analysis. Sitek et al. reported that 1000 cells were sufficient to generate a 2D image using our protocol <sup>24</sup>. Although the extracts from fewer membrane sheets could generate 2D images, the procedural protein loss is enhanced when the initial protein amount is decreased below a certain level. Although 100 sheets per three gels empirically generate a 2D image with an adequate number of protein spots, the amount of extracted protein can vary among cell types, and we recommend using more membranes if the number of protein spots detected on the 2D gel is less than expected.\n**Protein extraction** \n● Timing: day 3, 1 h\n18| Extract proteins from pseudopodia in the cut porous membrane \\(option A) and cell bodies \\(option B).\n\\(A) Extraction of pseudopodial proteins:\n   \\(i) Macerate 100 frozen membranes.\n   \\(ii) Rotate macerated membranes in lysis buffer at 4 °C for 15 min.\n   \\(iii) Centrifuge at > 10,000 g at 4 °C for 5 min to remove insoluble material.\n   \\(iv) Recover the supernatant and use it in protein expression studies.\n\\(B) Extraction of cell body proteins:\n   \\(i) Scrape 2-day MDA-MB-231 cell monolayers from the porous membrane.\n   \\(ii) Rotate the scraped cells in lysis buffer at 4 °C for 15 min.\n   \\(iii) Centrifuge at > 10,000 g at 4 °C for 5 min to remove insoluble material.\n   \\(iv) Recover the supernatant and use it in protein expression studies.\n**2D-DIGE**\n● Timing: days 3–7 \\(Figure 3)",
    "Protein separation by 2D-DIGE, handling of the target gel, and in-gel protein digestion are performed as previously described 29, except the following:\n**Sample preparation for 2D-DIGE:** label the proteins extracted from pseudopodia \\(option A) and cell bodies \\(internal control sample; option B) as described in REAGENT SETUP. All procedures should be performed in the dark.\nExpect the amount of protein extracted from pseudopodia to be rather small. \n**Functional analysis of candidate proteins**\n**RNA isolation** \n● Timing: day 8\n19| Total RNA was extracted from lysing MDA-MB-231 cells directly in a 10-cm culture dish using TRIzol Reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions<sup>30</sup>.\n▲ CRITICAL Work with TRIzol Reagent in a chemical fume hood using gloves and eye protection \\(shield, safety goggles). Avoid inhaling and contact with skin and clothing. \n▲ CRITICAL Following centrifugation, the mixture separates into a lower red phenol-chloroform phase, an interphase, and a colorless upper aqueous phase. RNA remains exclusively in the aqueous phase. The volume of the aqueous phase is approximately 60% that of TRIZOL Reagent.\n▲ CRITICAL Use 0.5 mL of isopropyl alcohol per 1 mL of TRIZOL Reagent used for homogenization. \n▲ CRITICAL Do not dry the RNA by centrifugation under vacuum. \n**Total cDNA synthesis, polymerase chain reaction, TA cloning, and target cDNA and siRNA synthesis** \n● Timing: days 8–X\nAll the procedures are performed as previously described<sup>20,31</sup>.\n**Transfection**  \n● Timing: days X–X+2\n20| Adherent cells are transiently transfected using the Lipofectamine LTX and Plus reagents according to the manufacturer’s instructions<sup>32</sup>.\n**Immunostaining and confocal microscopy**\n● Timing: days X + 2 \\(Figure 3)\n21| A total of 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> MDA-MB-231 cells are cultured on fibronectin-coated porous membrane for 2 days after transfection.\n22| Cells are washed 3 times with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min.",
    "23| Membranes are washed 3 times with PBS and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton-X in PBS at room temperature for 5 min. \n24| After washing 3 times with PBS, the membranes are incubated in blocking buffer containing 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. \n25| The membranes are treated with antibodies against the target protein in the blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. \n26| After washing with PBS for 5 min 3 times, the membranes are incubated with Alexa Flour 488-conjugated goat anti-candidate molecule antibody \\(appropriate dilution) in the blocking buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. \n27| After washing 3 times with PBS, phalloidin staining is performed for 20 min at room temperature.\n28| The stained membranes are washed 3 times with PBS, mounted, and covered with glass coverslips. \n29| The stained cells are examined using a FV1000D IX81 confocal scanning system equipped with 488-nm argon and 568-nm helium-neon lasers. X-YZ vertical sections are generated using a 0.5-mm motor step. Each image represents double-averaged \\(40–50 line scan) images.\n**Length and density of pseudopodia**  \n● Timing: days X + 2\n30| Capture multiple X-Y plane images using a 0.15-μm motor step along the Z-axis. \n31| Reconstitute Z-plane views of pseudopodia by stacking the X-Y plane images.\n32| Measure the Z-axial length of 200 pseudopodia for each cell type. \n33| Measure the area inside the peripheral margin of individual cells in the X-Y planes using ImageJ software.\n34| Count the number of pseudopodia present in this area. \n35| Analyze 30 cells on the membrane and calculate the pseudopodial density as the total number of pseudopodia divided by the total area occupied by the cells \\(number/μm2). \n36| Perform triplicate measurements per each cell type and calculate the mean density and standard error."
