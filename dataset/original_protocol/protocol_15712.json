    "This protocol follows the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) statement for the use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research. Rodent experiments were approved and monitored by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Columbia University.\nNOTE: Imaging was done on 2 month old C57BL/6J male mice that weighed approximately 23 g.\n1. Preparation of reagents for retinal imaging\nPreparation of injectable fluorescein solution.\n\tNOTE: Fluorescein is very light-sensitive. Protect from light and use it shortly after preparation.\n\t\nDilute fluorescein to a concentration of 1% in sterile saline.\nPreparation of Ketamine/Xylazine\n\t\nDilute Ketamine and Xylazine in sterile saline accordingly for the following concentration: Ketamine (80-100 mg/kg) and Xylazine (5-10 mg/kg).\nSterile saline\n\t\nPrepare a 5 mL syringe with a 26 G needle with sterile saline.\n2. OCT and fluorescein imaging\nTurn the retinal imaging microscope lightbox, the OCT machine, and the heated mouse platform ON.\nTurn the computer ON and open the imaging program.\nAdd one drop of phenylephrine and tropicamide to each eye.\nInject 150 µL of anesthesia (Ketamine (80-100 mg/kg) and Xylazine (5-10 mg/kg)) intraperitoneally (IP). Determine the depth of anesthesia by toe pinch and wait until the animal is unresponsive. Apply ophthalmic ointment or artificial tears to both the eyes.\nAccommodate the mouse on the platform.\nAdjust the height and angle of the platform until the view of the retinal fundus is clear and focused. Take a picture of the fundus.\nOpen the imaging and OCT software. In the OCT program, adjust nudge to 5.\nTake an OCT image at 75 µm distal from the burn. Repeat for the other three quadrants of the retina.\nInject 100 µL of 1% fluorescein IP.\nSwitch the camera to a 488 nm filter. Increase the camera gain to 5.",
    "Take a picture of the fundus at exactly 5 min after fluorescein injection.\n\t​NOTE: Avoid prolonged exposure of the eye to the camera light at maximum setting, as fluorescein can exacerbate retinal photodamage. Keep light source off until the 5 min wait time has elapsed and the mouse is ready for imaging.\n3. Aftercare\nInject 1 mL of sterile saline IP. Apply lubricant eye drops to both the eyes. Apply ophthalmic ointment or artificial tears to both the eyes.\nObserve the mouse as it recovers from anesthesia. Return to the cage with other animals only when fully recovered, generally after around 40 min.\n4. Assessment for exclusion criteria\nOpen the fundus image taken at 24 h post-procedure to assess for exclusion criteria. Exclude the eye if any of the following criteria are identified.\nAssess whether the image has zero occlusions\n\t\nEvaluate the image for the number of occluded vessels.\n\t\tNOTE: A successful occlusion usually has some purple pigmentation on or around the burn, very thin or discontinuous vessel through the burn, faint or non-existent vessel appearance outside the burn area, and retinal discoloration from hypoxia. If the entire vessel can be seen through the white burn by the laser, the vessel failed to occlude. Sometimes the vessel will appear partially obstructed, but if it looks uninterrupted outside the burn, the vessel likely didn't occlude.\nFor ambiguous cases, use FA imaging at the same time point to evaluate occlusions. In these images, an occlusion will appear as a break in the continuity of a vessel, often with a tapering of the surrounding vessel.\nIf zero occlusions are identified, exclude the eye from analysis, as the RVO is considered ineffective.",
    "NOTE: Occlusions typically resolve by 48-72 h post-RVO, and the presence of occlusions should no longer be used as an exclusion criterion at these time points.\nAssess the fundus and OCT images for excessive retinal detachment\n\tNOTE: Subretinal fluid accumulation is common after induction of RVO, and causes separation of neural retina from RPE. Exclusionary criteria for excessive retinal detachment are defined as follows: OCT will either be completely unviewable, or some layers will appear incredibly distorted. Image quality is poor, with a loss of resolution of outer plexiform and RPE layers. The separation between the neural retina and the choroid is greater than what the OCT field of view allows. On the fundus image, the retina tone will be nearly completely white, with some purple blotching. Part of the retina may appear distorted and out of focus. This is because it has detached and is at a different focal distance than the rest of the retina.\n\t\nIf the assessment of the images from an eye determines peripheral or complete detachment of the retina, exclude the eye from the analysis.\nExclude images with evidence of corneal cataract\n\tNOTE: A corneal cataract appears as an opaque white dot on the mouse's cornea. Cataracts typically occur due to insufficient lubrication of the eyes while the animal is anesthetized and can be largely avoided by taking care to apply eye ointment generously. Cataracts can generally be identified before imaging by inspecting the animal. Mice that have developed cataracts should be excluded from the dataset without needing to undergo the imaging process. In imaging, cataracts will obscure the retina from the camera, and the OCT will appear warped.\nAssess the image for excessive hemorrhage",
    "​NOTE: Excessive hemorrhage can be identified as amounts of red fluid in the image, usually obscuring retinal background, vessel, and burn. These areas of red fluid will be a brighter, opaquer red than the purple splotches that are normal in successful RVO. Hemorrhages show up at the ganglion cell layer on OCT imaging and interfere with the ability to visualize other retinal layers beneath the hemorrhage.\n\t\nIf the image is determined to have an excessive hemorrhage, exclude the eye from the analysis.\n5. Fluorescein image processing\nOpen the fluorescein image in the image processing software.\nDuplicate the image\nUsing a selection tool, carefully trace the major vessels.\n\t\nThe major vessels are the thicker veins and arteries radiating out from the optic disc. Ignore any vessels branching out from these vessels.\nIf leakage prevents the outline of the vessel from being seen near the occlusion site, trace through the leakage in the approximate location of the vessel (maintain thickness, connect the last visible point to the next visible point).\nIn the first image, delete the selection, leaving only the background. Save this masked image.\nMove the selection to the second image, invert the selection and delete, isolating the vessels. Save this masked image.\nOpen the two images in ImageJ. Open the background image and measure the integrated density.\nOpen the vessel's image, select the outline of the vessels, and then measure the mean intensity.\nDivide the integrated density of the background by the mean intensity of the vessels, generating the leakage ratio for the eye.\nRecord this leakage ratio for each eye in an experimental cohort.\nTo further control for background, normalize experimental eyes to the mean leakage ratio of uninjured control eyes.",
    "​NOTE: In order to create a standardized quantification of fluorescein leakage in the FA image, this calculation uses a ratio of the background density (where the leakage will be present) with the brightness of the major vessels to create results that control for the variation in brightness from image to image and can be reliably quantified. Eyes that are undamaged have no leakage and should theoretically have ratios of zero. The ratios calculated from these undamaged control eyes, therefore, represent background noise, and this value is used to further normalize experimental values.\n6. Retinal layer thickness\nOpen the OCT image in the image processing software.\nTrace the borders of the ganglion cell layer, inner plexiform layer, inner nuclear layer, outer plexiform layer, photoreceptor layer, and RPE layer. Measure the mean thickness of each layer.\nRepeat for OCT images from the other three quadrants of the retina. Average the mean layer thicknesses across the four quadrants to obtain the mean thickness of each retinal layer for the eye.\nRepeat for each eye in the experimental cohort.\n7. Disorganization of retinal inner layers (DRIL)\nOpen the OCT image in ImageJ.\nUsing the line tool, measure the distance where the upper border of the outer plexiform layer is indistinct.\n\tNOTE: It is important to differentiate between DRIL and areas of poor layer visibility caused by imaging artifacts. Poor OCT image quality may invalidate an eye for DRIL analysis if sufficient image resolution is not possible. Images with DRIL will typically have other regions or retinal layers that are clearly resolved and organized, which can be a good indicator of sufficient image quality.",
    "Measure horizontally from the latitude where the disorganization begins to the latitude where the upper border of the outer plexiform layer becomes visible again, if at all. Even if the outer plexiform layer shifts upward or downward vertically, measure perfectly horizontally.\nThere may be multiple areas of disorganization separated by areas with no disorganization. Measure these individually and calculate the sum of the distances.\nDivide the length of disorganization by the total length of the retina visible in each OCT image to obtain the ratio of disorganization for the image.\nRepeat the measurement and calculation for OCT images from the other three quadrants of the retina.\nTake the mean of the ratios of disorganization from the four OCT images. This number represents the average disorganization for the whole retina. Repeat for each eye in the experimental cohort.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
