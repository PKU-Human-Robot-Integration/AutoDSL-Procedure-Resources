    "1. Laser trap alignment and testing with polystyrene beads\nNOTE: For the setup, refer to Figure 1A,B.\nCAUTION: The experimentalist should wear appropriate protective eyewear or laser safety glasses during laser beam alignment. As the optical tweezer system described herein uses both HeNe and IR beams, two separate sets of laser safety glassware are required.\nHeNe Beam alignment\n\t\nPosition all optical components on the breadboard. Align the breadboard so it is as close to a 90° angle as possible relative to the microscope.\nAttach the mating tube containing the objective and telan lens to the microscope (Figure 1A-11,12).\n\t\tNOTE: The telan lens is a lens system that is used to focus the image at the intermediate image plane in the eyepieces.\nTurn on the HeNe laser and open the shutter (Figure 1A-18). The beam should strike filter (Figure 1A-3) at a height of 54 mm reflecting 50% of the light onto mirror 5 (Figure 1A-5). The remaining 50% of the beam strikes mirror 4 (Figure 1A-4) at the same height as mirror 3.\nAdjust mirror 4 (Figure 1A-4) so that the beam strikes mirror 6 (Figure 1A-6) at a height of 51 mm.\nAdjust mirror 6 (Figure 1A-6) so that the beam is directed to the lower galvanic mirror at a height of 51 mm. The beam that exits from the upper Galvanic mirror will be at 57.5 mm.\nAdjust mirror 3 (Figure 1A-3) so that this beam strikes mirror 5 (Figure 1A-5) at a height of 57.5 mm. Once reflected off mirror 5, the beam should strike mirror 9 (Figure 1A-9) at the same height. The beam is effectively recombined at mirror 9, passes through the objective, and telan lens system onto mirror 21 (Figure 1A-21), which reflects it into the objective.",
    "Place a clean microscope slide onto the stage of the microscope. Turn on the camera and image the beams of the fixed and scanning beams individually on the screen. Starting with mirror 3, then 5 and 9, finally 21, perform small adjustments to position the fixed beam in the center of the screen.\nTo ensure that the angle of the beam exiting mirror 21 is 90°, alter the Z-height of the microscope and position the beam imaged on the upper and lower surfaces of the slide. When they are identical, the beam is in the correct position, which is perpendicular to the stage. Shutter this beam using shutter 19 (Figure 1A-19).\nStarting with mirrors 4 and 6, perform small adjustments to position the fixed beam in the center of the screen. Shutter this beam.\nInfrared (IR) Beam alignment\n\tCAUTION: Perform all steps at low laser power for safety reasons.\n\t\nAdjust wave plate 14 (Figure 1A-14) to adjust the ratio of transmitted and reflected beams being split at the beam splitter 2 (Figure 1A-2). Beam splitter 2 reflects the s-component of the laser beam and transmits the p-component.\nThe beam that passes through 2, strikes mirror 7 (Figure 1A-7), which deflects the beam onto the lower galvanic mirror. It should follow the path of the HeNe beam onto mirror 21. Perform small movements of mirror 7 to achieve this positioning.\nAdjust mirror 2 so that the beam that is reflected by mirror 2, strikes mirror 10 (Figure 1A-10) at a height of 57.5 mm.\nThe beam is reflected from mirror 10 onto mirror 8 (Figure 1A-8) at a height of 57.5 mm. The subsequent beam should strike mirror 9 at the same height. If not, make small adjustments to mirrors 10 and 8 as required.",
    "Remove the objective and place the head of the power meter over the port in the objective turret.\nUse plates 14, 15, and 16 (Figure 1A-14,15,16) to adjust the power of each laser beam so that they are equal as shown in Figure 1C.\nPut beam expander 1 (Figure 1A-1) into place. Adjust the expanded laser beam to be circular without any coma or astigmatism.\nTo test the optical traps, make a solution of 1 μm polystyrene beads suspended in water. Then, place 10 μL of this solution on a microscope slide, place a coverslip on top and seal with nail polish. Place the slide on the microscope stage and test the optical traps by trapping these 1 μm beads. Ensure that the beads are sucked into the traps and held stably when the stage is moved. Trapping should occur equally efficiently from all sides of the trap.\n2. Microfluidic chamber preparation\nIf the flow cell is a commercially constructed device made from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) on a coverslip, proceed to step 3. If it is a glass device with connectors attached, proceed to step 4.\nIf the flow cell does not have connectors attached, bond them to the entry holes on the microscope slide first. See step 3 for the steps to attach connectors.\n3. Flow cell connections using a PDMS flow cell\nNOTE: For the setup, refer to Figure 2D.\nPlace the flow cell on a clean flat surface. Hold the PTFE tubing 3 mm from the free end with forceps. Push the tubing into the preformed port (the port can support 2 bar line pressure).\nRepeat this procedure for each of the remaining ports. Connect the inlet ports to the syringe pump and the outlet to a waste bottle (Figure 4A,B).",
    "Fill each glass syringe with 1 mL of spectrophotometric grade methanol. Attach each syringe to a switching valve. Ensure the valve has the outlet directed to waste and purge each line with 50 μL of methanol (Figure 4C, closed position).\nSwitch the outlet position to the flow cell (Figure 4C, open position). Pump 800 μL of methanol through the flow cell at a flow rate of 100 μL/h to wet the surfaces and eliminate bubbles.\nThe next day, repeat this process using 800 μL of ultrapure water. The flow cell is now ready for use.\n4. Attachment of press fit tubing connectors\nNOTE: For the setup, refer to Figure 2F.\nIf press-fit tubing connectors are to be used, carefully remove the adhesive tape from one side of the connector and place it over the hole in the microscope slide. Press down for a few seconds. Repeat the process for the remaining connectors.\nPlace the flow cell on a clean flat surface. Hold the PTFE tubing 3 mm from the free end with forceps. Push the tubing into the preformed hole in the port and repeat this procedure for each of the remaining ports.\nAttach tubing from the inlets to the switching valves. Proceed to step 7.\n5. Attachment of permanent assemblies\nNOTE: For the setup, refer to Figure 2A-C.\nPerform the attachment either on a clean, flat surface or on a custom-built manifold to hold the flow cell and connectors in place while bonding occurs.\nPlace the flow cell on a clean flat surface or in the recessed section of the manifold (Figure 2B). Place a small amount of glass glue on the bottom of the assembly and insert the seal.",
    "Position the nanoport over one of the entry holes on the microscope slide. Gently push down and hold in place with no lateral movement. Repeat the process for the remaining ports.\nAllow to dry or clamp in place in the manifold. Gently remove the flow cell from the manifold and ensure that the assemblies align well with the entry ports in the flow cell. Proceed to step 7 when ready.\n6. Flow cell connections and preparation\nNOTE: For the setup, refer to Figure 4A,B.\nPlace a flow cell on the microscope stage. Attach the tubing using the finger-tight connectors.\nFill each glass syringe with 1 mL of spectrophotometric grade methanol. Attach each syringe to a switching valve. Ensure the valve has the outlet directed to waste and purge each line with 50 μL of methanol (Figure 4C, closed position).\nSwitch the outlet position to the flow cell (Figure 4C, open position). Pump 800 μL of methanol through the flow cell at a flow rate of 100 μL/h to wet the surfaces and eliminate bubbles.\nThe next day, repeat this process using 800 μL of ultrapure water. The flow cell is now ready for use.\n7. Control of fluid flow\nTurn the switching valves to the closed position (Figure 4C). Remove the syringes, discard the residual water, and fill the syringes with experimental solutions, for example, DNA-beads; enzyme; and ATP. Return syringes to the pump and connect them to the switching valves.\nIn this position, manually force the plungers down 5-10 μL to remove any bubbles. Change the switching valve position to Open.",
    "Use the flow rate scheme to achieve a fluid flow speed optimal for trapping and visualization as outlined in Table 1. The optimal fluid flow for optical trapping should enable stable trapping of beads and once the DNA is stretched, it should be B-form (~3,000 bp/μm).\n8. Trapping of polystyrene beads with single DNA molecules attached\nAt 10x magnification, locate the border between fluid streams close to the channel entry points. Add oil to the 100x objective and switch to the higher magnification.\nOpen the shutters for the optical traps (either both or one at a time). The focused laser beams should trap beads and DNA should stretch out immediately.\nOnce a complex has been trapped, translate the stage perpendicular to the flow (Figure 3A,C, inset). This will move the trapped complex from the DNA bead solution, into stream 2. Further translation will move the complex to stream 3.\n9. Flow cell cleaning\nNOTE: Perform this daily.\nTurn off the pump when the experiment is complete. Turn the switching valves to the closed position (Figure 4C).\nRemove syringes and empty them. Rinse three times with filtered distilled water.\nFill the syringes with cleaning solution. Place syringes in the pump and connect to switching valves.\nPurge switching valves and change the position to open. Pump 800 μL of cleaning solution at a flow rate of 100 μL/h typically overnight.\nThe next day, close the switching valves, and then remove and rinse syringes with water. Rinse the flow cell and lines with 4-800 μL of water at a flow rate of 400-800 μL/h. If more strenuous cleaning of flow cells is required, replace the cleaning solution with 6 M guanidium hydrochloride.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
