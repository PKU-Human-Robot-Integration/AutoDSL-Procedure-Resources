    "Preparation of the strainsUsing a sterile toothpick, pick a small aliquot of the frozen H. volcanii strain from a -80 °C glycerol stock and streak onto a glycerol minimal medium (GMM) plate. Repeat this for each strain including the parent, mutant, and complement strains. The stocks consist of stationary phase cells frozen in GMM with 20% (v/v) glycerol.Incubate the plates for 5 days in a closed plastic zippered bag at 42 °C, until colonies appear.Using a sterilized toothpick, collect five isolated colonies and put them into 20 mL of GMM in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask. This approach avoids dilution stress.Grow the cells at 42 °C (200 rpm, rotary shaking) using the I24 Incubator shaker.After 48 h of incubation, prepare a 1:5 dilution of each strain by sterile transfer of 0.2 mL culture and 0.8 mL fresh GMM in disposable plastic cuvettes. Measure the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) using a Genesys 40 visible spectrophotometer using uninoculated GMM to blank the instrument. Multiply the value obtained on the instrument by 5 to determine the original OD600. The cells should be at an OD600 of 0.8 to 1.0, which is equivalent to late log phase.Dilute the cells with fresh GMM to an OD600 of 0.1 in 65 mL of final volume in a sterile 125 mL Erlenmeyer flask. For example, for cells at an OD600 of 0.89, mix 7.3 mL of cell culture with 57.7 mL of fresh GMM. Gently swirl the diluted cells to mix.Using 10 mL sterile pipets, transfer aliquots (5 mL) of this cell suspension into 12 loosely capped sterile 13 × 100 mm glass culture tubes per strain type. Include tubes with 5 mL of fresh uninoculated GMM as negative controls.",
    "Incubate the cell cultures for 12 h at 42 °C with aeration using a mini rotator (Glas-Col from Terre Haute in the USA) fitted with a culture rack (see details below). Use the maximum percent speed setting of 50 for the rotation. Perform the incubation in a Heratherm incubator.Measure the OD600 of the culture by directly inserting the culture tube with the plastic cap into the Spectronic 20+ spectrophotometer (refer to Figure 2 to use the Spectronic 20+ spectrophotometer before measuring samples). Use the uninoculated controls to determine the background signal. The cells should reach log phase, which is estimated at an OD600 of 0.4–0.6. Make sure to close the lid of the instrument prior to taking the OD600 measurements.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4557/bioprotoc-12-22-4557-g002.jpgFigure 2. Steps to set up the Spectronic 20+ spectrophotometer before measuring samples. 1) Turn on the spectrophotometer by turning the Power switch/Zero control to the right. 2) Make sure the filter lever is set to 600–900 nm and the red light is turned on. 3) The wavelength should be adjusted to 600 nm. 4) Allow for the spectrophotometer to warm up for 15 minutes. 5) Adjust the Power switch/Zero control to percent transmittance to 0. 6) Place into the sample compartment the 13 × 100 mm glass culture tube with only the medium (GMM) that will serve as a blank to 7) adjust the Transmittance/ Absorbance control (100%T/0A) to 100/0.Note: Do not remove plastic cap; the cap and the tube should both fit in the compartment. Setup for incubationIncubate the culture tubes in a Heratherm incubator with the following setup (Figure 3):Place the culture tubes on a 96-place test tube rack attached to a mini rotator.Place the mini rotator with the culture tubes on the top shelf of the incubator.",
    "On the bottom shelf of the incubator, fill a 1 L beaker with distilled water up to the 1,000 mL mark to maintain moisture in the incubator.Turn on rotator and slowly increase the maximum percent speed to 50.Note: The same incubation setup is used after supplementation of NaOCl. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4557/bioprotoc-12-22-4557-g003.jpgFigure 3. Schematic of the workflow for setting up for incubation. Circled numbers refer to the steps in the text.Preparation of NaOClUpon arrival of shipment, dispense the NaOCl reagent in 10 mL aliquots in 15 mL conical tubes and store at -80 °C (time of NaOCl storage was not monitored).For each experiment, thaw 10 mL of frozen NaOCl stock to room temperature. Briefly vortex the solution once it is thawed.Then, transfer 5 mL of the thawed NaOCl solution to a fresh 15 mL conical tube, which serves as the 16.2 M NaOCl stock.Perform a serial dilution of the 16.2 M NaOCl stock to a final concentration of 2.025 M as follows: dispense 2.5 mL of nanopure water to three 15 mL conical tubes, perform a 1:2 dilution by transferring 2.5 mL of the 16.2 M stock to the first of the three tubes and mixing the solution to generate an 8.1 M stock, repeat the 1:2 dilutions two more times to a final concentration of 2.025 M (Figure 4A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4557/bioprotoc-12-22-4557-g004.jpgFigure 4. Schematic of the workflow for preparation and supplementation of NaOCl. A) Preparation of NaOCl; B) Supplementation of NaOCl. Circled numbers refer to the steps in the text.Supplementation of NaOCl (Figure 4B)Randomly select half of the 12 culture tubes for each strain for supplementation with or without 5 mM NaOCl.Supplement the first set of 6 culture tubes with 12.3 µL of nanopure water.Attention: Vortex each individual cell culture tube immediately after addition of the water.",
    "Supplement the second set of 6 cell cultures with 12.3 µL of 2.025 M NaOCl for a final concentration of 5 mM.Attention: Vortex each individual cell culture tube immediately after addition of the NaOCl. Monitoring of cell growth after supplementation with NaOClRemove all cell culture tubes from the mini rotator every 24 h of incubation at 42 °C after supplementing with NaOCl.Examine the culture tubes to see if there are marks visible on the outside of the tube. If marks are present on the outside of the tubes, use a Kimwipe with ethanol to remove the marks. This action will allow the OD600 to be more accurately measured using the Spectronic 20+ spectrophotometer.Place each culture tube directly into the spectrophotometer individually to determine the OD600 value.If using the Spectronic 20+ spectrophotometer, make sure to close the lid before recording the OD600.Repeat these OD600 measurements for 10 days.Further analysis of strains that may exhibit two distinct responses in hypochlorite stressExposing cells to second round of hypochlorite stress (Figure 5).For further analysis of the biological significance of a mutation, pool tubes with a similar growth pattern and treat as independent groups. For example, the mutant strain of this example is treated as three independent groups after the first stress assay. The first group consists of culture tubes pooled for the mock control. The second group is the pool of cell cultures that did not grow under 5 mM NaOCl. The third group is the pool of cell cultures that grew in the presence of 5 mM NaOCl.Measure the OD600 for the two groups, by using the same measuring method from step A5.Repeat steps A6 and A7.Incubate the cell cultures for 10 h as in Section B.Repeat all steps from Sections C–E.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4557/bioprotoc-12-22-4557-g005.jpgFigure 5.",
    "Schematic of the workflow for preparing strains for second incubation with hypochlorite. Circled numbers refer to the steps in the text.Plate count assayAfter 10 days of monitoring the growth of each cell culture tube, randomly choose 2 or 3 technical replicates of each sample type to perform a serial dilution in 18% concentrated salt water (SW) (Figure 6).First transfer 1 mL of cell culture into a sterilized 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.Then, transfer 50 µL of this cell culture to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube with 950 µL of 18% SW, and mix the sample by pipetting up and down.Repeat step b three more times to generate a serial dilution series of 1:20, 1:400, 1:8,000, and 1:16,000.Plate 100 µL of the diluted samples on ATCC 974 agar medium plates using an L-shaped cell spreader.Allow the plates to air dry for ~15 min. Place the air-dried plates in a plastic bag and incubate at 42 °C for 5 days.When the colonies are visible, choose a plate that appears to have between 30 and 300 colonies. Count the total colonies.Calculate the CFUs per mL (CFUs/mL) of the sample by multiplying the number of colonies times the dilution factor of the counted plate. Note that because only 100 µL of cells were plated, a multiple of 10 must be included in the calculations of CFU per mL in addition to the original dilution factors (*DF) that range from 400 to 16,000.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4557/bioprotoc-12-22-4557-g006.jpgFigure 6. Schematic workflow for plate count assay. Circled numbers refer to the steps in the text.Data analysisRecord and plot the OD600 units over time (hours) in Microsoft Excel. Use the scatter plot to compare growth patterns of the different strains and culture conditions including the mock (H2O) and experimental sets (exposed to 5 mM NaOCl). An example is shown in Figure 7. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.",

Scatter plots comparing the growth curve from “New setup” of Figure 1 Calculate the growth rate and doubling time of each strain.Plot time (h) against LN(OD of 600) to better identify the exponential phase (straight line). Choose the best two (or three) points that give the best straight line (Figure 8).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4557/bioprotoc-12-22-4557-g008.jpgFigure 8. Plot time (h) against LN(OD of 600) to better identify the exponential phase (straight line) Calculate the growth rate by adding a linear trendline by going to Chart Design < Press Add Chart Element < Go to Trendline < Choose Linear < Go to More Trendline Options < Select Display Equation on chart (Figure 9). This will give you an equation for the trendline that includes the slope of the line that is the growth rate in generation per hour (gen/h).Note: The growth rate for each 12 technical replicates is calculated separately. Then, the average growth rate (µ) is calculated based on all growth rates from each replicate. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4557/bioprotoc-12-22-4557-g009.jpgFigure 9. Finding the growth rate. After selecting More Trendline Options make sure the option is set to Linear (A) and select Display Equation on chart (B). The slope of the trendline is the growth rate in generation per hour (gen/h).To calculate the doubling time (k), use the average growth rate in the following formula:k = 1/µ Calculate the standard deviation (±) for each average growth rate and doubling time.For the strains supplemented with 5 mM NaOCl, the exponential phase will be seen much later than the mock control (H2O). As shown in Figure 10, the two points that made a straight line were selected after adding the 5 mM of NaOCl.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4557/bioprotoc-12-22-4557-g010.jpgFigure 10.

    "Calculating Area Under the Curve (A.U.C.) by using Trapezoidal RuleFor each technical replicate find the area under the curve by finding the area of each trapezoid. For example, first trapezoid is between x = 1 and x = 2 by using the following formula (Figure 11A):area = (y1 + y2)/2*(x2 - x1)Calculate the area for the other trapezoids (Figure 11B).Then, add the areas of all trapezoids to find the sum that will be the A.U.C. for the growth curve (Figure 11C).Repeat the above steps for each technical replicate for each strain, then find the average and standard error.For helpful reference to guide A.U.C. calculations see Github link https://rdrr.io/github/leonpheng/lhtool/man/AUC.html[href=https://rdrr.io/github/leonpheng/lhtool/man/AUC.html].Plot the average of A.U.C. of each strain in the bar graph and add the technical replicates individually and convert them to a scatter plot (Figure 11D). Use the average for each experiment to calculate if it has equal variance by F-test. If so, use the two-tailed Student’s t-test analysis to find if there are significant differences between strains.Note: If you find that the variances are unequal, you can do the two-tailed, unpaired Welch's t-test instead of the Student's t-test. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4557/bioprotoc-12-22-4557-g011.jpgFigure 11. Calculating the Area Under the Curve (A.U.C.) for a Haloferax volcanii strain (H26). A) Find the area of the trapezoid by using area = (y1 + y2)/2*(x2 - x1). B) Calculate the area for the other trapezoids. C) Find the sum of all areas to find the area under the curve. D) Example of bar graph showing the A.U.C. and the significant differences between strains by using the Student’s t-test analysis."
