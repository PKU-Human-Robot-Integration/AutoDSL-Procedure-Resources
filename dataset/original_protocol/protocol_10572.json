  "procedures": [
    "This protocol is based on Mayo et al.31 (Experiment 1) and Ree et al.32 (Experiment 2). Ethical approval was granted by the Regional Ethical Review Board, Linköping, Sweden (Experiment 1) and the local ethical committee at the Department of Psychology, University of Oslo, Norway (Experiment 2).\n1. Participant Screening and Preparation\nRecruit participants who lack tactile or uncorrected visual disturbances and are free of any neurological or psychiatric disorder, unless a specific patient population is being recruited.\nEnsure that participants are fully able to understand task instructions (e.g., fluent in the language that tasks are administered).\nIf including more than one task (e.g. Experienced, Observed), ensure that task order is counterbalanced across participants, stratifying for gender, age, or other distinguishing factors.\n2. Stimuli and Task Construction\nNOTE: See Table 1 for experimental design.\nExperienced touch task (Experiments 1 and 2)\nCreate trials such that they consist of a baseline period, touch administration, and self-report ratings, all separated by jittered ITIs.\n\t\t\nBaseline periods consist of a blank screen, fixation cross, or other neutral scene prior to tactile stimulation.\nTactile stimulation is followed by a short (e.g. 1-2 s) ITI, then self-report ratings are obtained.\nA jittered inter-trial interval (ITI; e.g. 6-7 s) follows self-report ratings to allow muscle activity to return to baseline levels before the next trial begins.\nUse either audio (Experiment 131) or visual (Experiment 232) cues to ensure that touch is delivered at the appropriate velocity.\n\t\t\nTo use audio cues, have cues delivered to headphones worn by the experimenter to track the pace of the stimulation using a metronome. Distinguish velocities using tones of differing pitches (or other distinguishing audio cue, e.g., a cue saying \"10 cm/s\") that precede the stimulation cues.",
    "To use visual cues, display cues on a tablet only in view of the experimenter. Use a moving bar to track velocity of touch administration.\nPrior to the start of the study, practice to ensure that touch is delivered at the appropriate velocity and a consistent pressure. To do so, apply brushstrokes to the scale in a similar manner as to the participant. The scale readout is used to determine if the pressure changes throughout touch administration. For instance, a pressure of 0.4 N would read as 40 g on the scale.\nObserved touch task (Experiment 1)\nEnsure that videos of touch administration are of similar length, regardless of velocity.\n\t\t\nInclude both CT-optimal (1-10 cm/s) and non-optimal (less than 1 cm/s or more than 10 cm/s) velocities.\nStart trials with a fixation cross or other neutral condition followed by video.\nNOTE: Videos contain touch delivered to CT-rich hairy skin (arm), CT-lacking glabrous skin (palm), and a non-social condition in which touch is delivered to a fake wooden arm (Fig. 2; see supplemental videos).\n\t\t\nAfter a 1-2 s ITI, obtain self-report ratings.\nAllow another 6-7 ITI following ratings to precede the next trial to allow EMG activity to return to baseline.\n3. Facial Electromyography\nData acquisition and filtering guidelines (based on previous protocols27,34)\nUse software to apply filtering steps either in real-time or offline. Typical filtering steps include a comb band stop filter to filter out potential noise from AC power (50/60 Hz), followed by smoothing and rectification.\n\t\tNOTE: Initial basic filtering steps may be set on EMG amplifiers (e.g., a high pass filter of 10 Hz and a low pass filter of 500 Hz or 1,000 Hz).\nElectrode application (based on previous protocols27,34)",
    "Briefly describe the application process to the participant. Use neutral words (\"sensor\") instead of potentially anxiety-evoking words (\"electrode\")34.\n\t\t\nDecide what information to tell the participants regarding the purpose of the sensors.\nNOTE: In the current studies, participants were told sensors would measure muscle and sweat activity during the session.\nClean the participants' skin prior to electrode application.\n\t\t\nUse water to wipe clean the areas in which sensors will be applied.\nUse an exfoliant scrub to lightly abrade the same areas. Use caution to prevent major skin irritation, though minor irritation is likely to occur.\nUse electrode pairs consisting of two 4 mm shielded bipolar recording electrodes plus one monopolar reference electrode.\n\t\t\nApply adhesive collars to the electrodes such that they adhere to the skin.\nOnce collars adhere to the outer rim of the electrodes, fill sensors with a conductive electrode gel, taking care to prevent the formation of air bubbles.\nPlace electrode pairs parallel to the muscle(s) of interest and perpendicular to potential sources of noise, such as other muscles34.\n\t\t\nCorrugator: Affix one electrode directly above the eyebrow along an imaginary vertical line that traverses the inner corner of the eye. Place the second electrode 1 cm lateral and slightly superior to the first, along the border of the eyebrow.\nZygomatic: Place the first sensor midway along an imaginary line that connects the upper ear (where the ear meets the skull) and the corner of the mouth. Place the second electrode 1 cm medial (towards the mouth). Take care to avoid the masseter muscle.\nUse an 8 mm unshielded, monopolar recording electrode as a reference electrode. Place the electrode in the middle of the forehead, equidistant (above) the inner brows and (below) the hairline.",
    "Ensure that electrode wires are placed such that they do not impede vision. Use medical tape to ensure long-term adherence of the electrodes to skin and reduce noise/artifacts due to cord movement.\nDetermine the quality of electrode application with an impedance monitor. Acceptable impedance levels are below 20 kΩ. If electrodes need to be reapplied to reach appropriate impedance levels, use a clean pair of electrodes.\n4. Task Procedure\nGeneral order\nFollowing sensor application, complete task(s). If using more than one task, counterbalance order across participants.\nEnsure that participants are seated comfortably to minimize extraneous movement that may introduce movement artifacts34.\nExperienced touch task\nSeat participants in front of computer with the to-be-touched arm extended laterally, resting comfortably (e.g., on a cushion).\nNOTE: It is recommended to apply touch to the arm that is not being used for self-reported ratings in order to minimize potential movement artifacts in the EMG signal.\nOcclude view of the arm from the participant either using a curtain separator31 or goggles that occlude lateral vision (Figure 132) 35.\nInstruct the participant to focus on how the touch makes them feel.\nVary touch location to avoid CT fatigue36.\nAdminister touch using a 75 mm goat hair brush applied to designated section(s) marked on the arm (and palm). Alternatively, apply touch using a force-controlled robot37.\nUse consistent touch administration direction, e.g., back-and-forth (distal-to-proximal, then proximal to distal) or single direction (proximal-to-distal only)\nObserved touch task\nSeat participant in front of the computer that will display the videos.\nInstruct the participant that they will have to rate how the video made them feel.\nEnsure that the participant is out of view of the experimenter34.\n5. Data Cleaning and Analysis",
    "To assess the mean EMG activation to a specific touch stimulus type, compare the response to the touch stimulus to the preceding baseline, i.e. [mean activation during 6 s touch stimulation] - [mean activation during 1 s prestimulus \"baseline\"], as suggested by Fridlund and Cacioppo34.\nAverage responses for each touch stimulus type (CT-optimal, non-optimal and, if appropriate, each location (arm/palm).\nDo this for each muscle (corrugator, zygomatic) and self-report rating (pleasantness, intensity) individually.\nTo obtain a more sensitive time course, compute mean EMG activation during smaller time intervals (e.g., 700 ms; see Figure 532). Subtract the same 1 s baseline from all intervals to remove baseline EMG activity.\nNOTE: Prior to analysis, it is recommended to have data manually checked by raters blinded to touch conditions to eliminate trials with artifactual activations34.\nSubscription Required.
