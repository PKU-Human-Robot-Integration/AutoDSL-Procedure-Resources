    "1. Building a Behavior Arena and Preparing Hardware to Enable Optogenetic Stimulation in the Behavior Arena\nTo build a light-deprived behavior arena, construct a box with a dimension of 89 x 61 x 66 cm3 (35\" L x 24\" W x 26\" H) made of black colored plexiglass acrylic sheets (3 mm thick) (see Table of Materials). Materials to build such a box should be available at local hardware stores. Place this box on a table-top in the behavior room (Figure 1A).\nMount a monochrome USB 3.0 CCD camera fitted with an IR long-pass 830 nm filter and an 8 mm F1.4 C-mount lens (see Table of Materials) to the center of the ceiling of the black box. Place two infra-red LED strips (see Table of Materials) on the table-top in order to illuminate the larvae in the dark arena (Figure 1A).\nTo build the LED platform, obtain a 22 cm × 22 cm square Aluminum plate (preferably spray painted with a matte black finish to eliminate any reflections). In the center of the plate, using a metal cutter, cut a hole that is large enough to fit around the CCD camera.\nCover the metal plate with red LED strip lights (see Table of Materials). Solder LED light strip wires in series and feed the strip wires into an optocoupler relay controlled by a Raspberry Pi 2B microprocessor (see Table of Materials) (Figure 1B and 2).\nInstall and configure Ubuntu Mate/Raspian Jesse/Linux based operating system on the Raspberry Pi processor before connecting the optocoupler relay to the LED strips. Attach a power supply to power the LED strips and the optocoupler (Figure 2) (see Table of Materials). Mount the LED platform around the CCD camera (Figure 1B).",
    "NOTE: Ubuntu Mate v16.04 operating system is freely available. A set of simple Python based commands can be easily adapted to program patterns of LED light stimuli (see file of syntax).\nEnsure homogenous irradiance at various points in the behavior arena. Measure the absolute irradiance at the surface of the arena with the help of a Spectrometer and determine it to be ~1.3 W/m2 throughout the surface of the arena.\n\tNOTE: At this intensity, no significant changes were observed in temperature over the course of the experiments. Another study10 used a higher irradiance of ~1.9 W/m2 and observed no changes in temperature over the course of the experiments.\n2. Preparation of Drosophila Larvae for Behavior Analyses\nMaintain the flies on standard fly food (see Table of Materials) at 25 °C, 50-60% RH, and a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle.\nIn order to express CsChrimson in a single pair of ORNs, cross virgin females from a UAS-IVS-CsChrimson line to males from an OrX-Gal4 line ('X' corresponds to one of 21 larval odor receptor (Or) genes that are uniquely expressed in each of 21 pairs of ORNs)9,11.\nAlternately, in order to express CsChrimson in all 21 larval ORNs, cross virgin females from a UAS-IVS-CsChrimson line to males from an Orco-Gal4 line ('Orco' is the co-receptor that is expressed in all 21 ORNs).\nUse UAS-IVS-CsChrimson line by itself as a control in these experiments.\n\t\tNOTE: The fly stocks listed here are all available at the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (see Table of Materials).\nOnce male and female flies in a cross are allowed to mate and lay eggs for 48 h, transfer adults to a fresh vial.",
    "To the surface of the food vial containing eggs, add 400 µL of a mixture containing 400 µM all-trans retinal (ATR) dissolved in Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 89 mM sucrose dissolved in distilled water.\n\t\tNOTE: The small amount of sucrose promotes larval feeding of the ATR solution. ATR is a cofactor required for upregulating of CsChrimson expression9,10. ATR is light sensitive.\nOnce ATR is added to the food vials containing eggs, incubate the vials in the dark for an additional 72 h.\n\t\tNOTE: While this study and the above two studies have not observed effects on larval behavior due to ATR feeding, it is recommended controlling for the effects of ATR feeding by subjecting test lines to the same amount of the above mixture that does not contain ATR.\nExtract third-instar larvae (~120 h after egg laying) from the surface of fly food by floating them using a high density (15%) sucrose solution. Using a P1000 micropipette separate the larvae floating on the surface of the sucrose solution into a 1000 mL glass beaker.\nWash larvae 3–4 times by exchanging 800 mL fresh distilled water in the glass beaker each time. Allow larvae to rest for 10 min before subjecting them to the behavior assay.\n3. Behavior Assay\nMaintain consistent temperature (between 22–25 °C) and humidity (between 50 and 60% RH) in the behavior room.\nPrepare larval crawling medium by pouring 150 mL of melted agarose (1.5%) into a 22 cm x 22 cm square Petri dish. One Petri dish is poured for each trial of the assay, 8–10 trials per experiment. Allow agarose to solidify and cool for 1–2 h in the Petri dishes before using them in the behavior assay.",
    "Transfer no more than 20 of the prepped third-instar larvae to the center of Petri dish (Figure 1C). Cover the Petri dish with its lid. Place the Petri dish in the behavior arena under the CCD camera.\n\t\tNOTE: Depending on the experiment, behavior assays are typically carried out for 3–5 min. If an odorant is used in the assay to provide guidance cues, it has been observed that the resulting odor gradient remains stable for approximately 5 min1. Longer assay times are not recommended. Deleterious effects on larvae due to dehydration or from prolonged 630 nm red-light exposure have not been observed within these time points.\nTurn ON the 850 nm infra-red LED light source to visualize larvae in the video. Start the CCD camera to record larval movement.\nUsing the software associated with the Raspberry Pi processor, program the procedure to administer appropriate patterns of red light stimulation.\n\tNOTE: A set of simple Python based commands can be easily adapted to program patterns of LED light stimuli (see file of syntax).\n4. Data Processing and Analysis\nImport the recorded video of each trial into any available programming software like Matlab.\nObtain XY coordinates of every larva in a movie as a function of time. Based on limits of the tracking software, 15–20 third-instar larvae can be tracked in a single movie1,8.\n\tNOTE: A set of simple Matlab codes ('Tracklarva') that can be easily adapted to suit appropriate conditions (see file of syntax) is provided. This program combines all trials in an experiment and outputs the XY coordinates of every larva for the entire duration of the assay (see code syntax below). Alternately, one could use several open-source based programs that are freely available for researchers. E.g. JAABA (http://jaaba.sourceforge.net/)12.",
    "Use the generated XY coordinates to plot larval trajectories and to further analyze larval locomotion.\nFor behavior analyses, use navigational statistics such as speed, path curvature, heading angle, to segment individual larval trajectories into alternating sequences of runs and turns.\nRuns are defined as continuous periods of forward movement. Turns separate successive runs. Turns are flagged when changes to trajectory orientation angles were >45° (see file of syntax).\nCalculate average values for run speed, run length, run direction, and other parameters as required.\n\tNOTE: A set of simple syntax to extract 'runs' and 'stops' from larval trajectories is provided (see file of syntax). Simple Matlab or Excel based functions can be applied to the extracted data to calculate values for 'run speed', 'run length' etc.\nRepresent data for each behavioral metric as mean ± SEM.\nSubscription Required.
