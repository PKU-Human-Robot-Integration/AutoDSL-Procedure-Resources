Full-length POI is only expressed in the presence of membrane-permeable DiZPK, but not in the absence of DiZPK.\nSeed HEK293T cells in 6-well plates with normal growth medium (i.e., DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS) and incubate the cells at 37°C/5% CO2 for 12–18 h.\nNote: For cells to be transfected, growth medium containing 10% FBS and no antibiotics should be used.\nNote: For experimental design, a positive control experiment with wild-type POI and a negative control experiment without DiZPK in the media should be performed in parallel to evaluate specific incorporation of DiZPK into the POI.\nNote: In general, HEK293T cells are ideal for expressing amber mutants of POI because of their high transfection efficiency. Alternatively, other cell lines that are readily transfected, such as HeLa and HCT116 cells, can also be used.\nCheck cell confluency the next day and transfect the cells with Xtremegene 9 at ~80% confluency. Prepare transfection complexes for wild-type POI and amber mutants as follows.\nTransfection of wild-type POI: (i) Dilute 2 μg of plasmid encoding wild-type POI (e.g., pCMV-POI-HA) in 200 μL of Opti-MEM for two wells to be transfected in a microcentrifuge tube. (ii) Add 6 μL of Xtremegene 9 to the diluted DNA. (iii) Mix the solution by gently pipetting and incubate the solution for 20–30 min at room temperature (20°C–28°C).",
    "Transfection of amber mutants of POI: (i) Dilute 2 μg of plasmid encoding an amber mutant of POI (e.g., pCMV-POI-X-TAG-HA) and 2 μg of pCMV-DiZPK-PylRS in 400 μL of Opti-MEM for two wells to be transfected in a microcentrifuge tube. (ii) Add 12 μL of Xtremegene 9 to the diluted DNA. (iii) Mix the solution by gently pipetting and incubate the solution for 20–30 min at room temperature (20°C–28°C).\nCritical: The transfection mixtures are prepared for two wells of a 6-well plate, one well for “+DiZPK” sample and the other for “-DiZPK” control. The transfection mixtures are split equally into two wells in step 4.\nCritical: It is recommended to optimize the cell confluency for optimal transfection efficiency. Other transfection reagents that are applicable for HEK293T cells can also be used, such as Jetprime.\nCritical: The concentrations of plasmid stocks used for transfection are normally around 500 ng/μL.\nDuring incubation, replace the cell culture media with 2 mL of fresh cell growth media supplemented with or without 1 mM DiZPK per well. For the negative control without DiZPK in the media, cell growth media containing same volume of DMSO should be used.\nCritical: DiZPK is dissolved in DMSO at 500 mM as the stock solution, which is diluted with fresh cell growth media before the experiment. The DiZPK stock solution can be stored at −20°C for three months.\nCritical: Fresh cell growth media should be added into the cells carefully to avoid cell detachment.\nSplit the transfection mixtures equally for the wells to be transfected. Add the transfection mixtures prepared in step 2 dropwise into the cell media.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C/5% CO2 for additional 16–24 h.",
    "Remove the media and add 1 mL of PBS into the wells. Collect the cells by repeated pipetting with 1 mL tips and transfer to microcentrifuge tubes. Centrifuge the cells at 1,000 × g and 4°C for 3 min.\nNote: The “+DiZPK” sample and “-DiZPK” control should be processed in parallel in the following steps. For cell lines that adhere firmly to culture dishes (e.g., HeLa cells), use 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution or cell scrapers for collecting the cells.\nDiscard the supernatant and wash the cells with PBS twice and finally remove the supernatant. Use centrifugation at 1,000 × g and 4°C for 3 min to collect the cells between washes.\nPause Point: The cell pellets can be stored at −80°C for at least several months.\nLyse the cells by adding 50 μL of 4% SDS lysis buffer supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail and 0.2 μL benzonase (50 U) to the cell pellets. Vortex at room temperature (20°C–28°C) until the lysates become not sticky.\nNote: Lysis of cells with SDS-containing buffer maximally solubilizes the proteins. Alternatively, cells can also be lysed with other detergent-containing lysis buffers.\nClarify cell lysates by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at room temperature (20°C–28°C).\nUse a standard BCA assay to quantify the protein concentrations.\nNote: The protein concentrations of cell lysates should be around 10 mg/mL.\nDispense aliquots of equal amounts of cell lysates (e.g., 100 μg) for each sample into microcentrifuge tubes and bring the volumes to 70 μL with 4% SDS lysis buffer supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitors. Add 25 μL of 4 × SDS loading buffer and 5 μL of 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME; 5% final concentration) to each sample. The final concentration of each sample should be around 1 mg/mL.",
    "Vortex and heat the samples at 95°C for 10 min in a heating block to denature the proteins.\nCentrifuge the samples at 5,000 × g for 3 min at room temperature (20°C–28°C).\nLoad 15–20 μL of each sample onto a 4%–20% Tris-HCl gel and run electrophoresis. Transfer proteins from the gel onto a nitrocellulose membrane and probe for the POI using the antibody against the affinity tag (e.g., HA tag) with standard immunoblotting techniques.\nNote: Western blotting analysis is used to assess the incorporation of DiZPK and expression of DiZPK-modified POI. As an example, the result for incorporation of DiZPK into an antiviral protein IFITM3 is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/185-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Results for Site-Specific Photo-Crosslinking of IFITM3 in HEK293T Cells\n(A) Western blot analysis of HEK293T cells expressing HA-IFITM3-TAG mutants in the presence or absence of DiZPK.\n(B) Western blot analysis of photo-crosslinking complexes in HEK293T cells expressing HA-IFITM3-TAG mutants with or without UV irradiation.\n(C) Quantitative proteomic analysis for identification of photo-crosslinked IFITM3-interacting proteins. VCP, highly enriched in photo-crosslinking samples, is marked in red.\n(D) Western blot analysis for validation of IFITM3-VCP photo-crosslinking complex. The red asterisk and double asterisks indicate co-immunoprecipitated VCP and photo-crosslinked IFITM3-VCP complex, respectively. Note that N-terminally HA-tagged IFITM3 constructs were used in these experiments.\nNote: The incorporation efficiency of DiZPK is evaluated by comparing the expression levels of DiZPK-modified POI with that of wild-type POI. DiZPK-modified POI is generally expressed at a lower level relative to wild-type, but should be readily detected by western blot in order for successful photo-crosslinking experiments.\nPhoto-Crosslinking of DiZPK-modified POI in HEK293T Cells\nTiming: 3 days",
    "Cells expressing DiZPK-modified POI are irradiated with or without 365-nm UV light and lysed for western blot analysis to examine DiZPK-induced protein photo-crosslinking of POI in live cells (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Upon protein photo-crosslinking of the POI, a series of slower-migrating bands indicative of higher-molecular-weight photo-crosslinked complexes are observed in western blot.\nSeed HEK293T cells in 6-well plates with normal growth medium (i.e., DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS) and incubate the cells at 37°C/5% CO2 for 12–18 h.\nCritical: Generally, cells are seeded into two plates, one plate for UV irradiation (“+UV”) and the other for non-irradiation (“-UV”).\nNote: It is recommended to survey a series of highly expressed amber mutants of POI for optimal photo-crosslinking efficiency and site-dependent photo-crosslinking.\n16. Check cell confluency the next day and transfect the cells with Xtremegene 9 at ~80% confluency. Prepare transfection complexes for POI amber mutants as follows: (i) Dilute 2 μg of plasmid encoding an amber mutant of POI (e.g., pCMV-POI-X-TAG-HA) and 2 μg of pCMV-DiZPK-PylRS in 400 μL of Opti-MEM for two wells to be transfected in a microcentrifuge tube. (ii) Add 12 μL of Xtremegene 9 to the diluted DNA. (iii) Mix the solution by gently pipetting and incubate the solution for 20–30 min at room temperature (20°C–28°C).\nCritical: The transfection mixtures are prepared for two wells of a 6-well plate, one well for “+UV” sample and the other for “-UV” control. The transfection mixtures are split equally into two wells in step 18.\nCritical: It is recommended to optimize the cell confluency for optimal transfection efficiency. Other transfection reagents that are applicable for HEK293T cells can also be used, such as Jetprime.\nCritical: The concentrations of plasmid stocks used for transfection are normally around 500 ng/μL.",
    "During incubation, replace the cell culture media with 2 mL of fresh cell growth media supplemented with 1 mM DiZPK per well.\nCritical: DiZPK is dissolved in DMSO at 500 mM as the stock solution, which is diluted with fresh cell growth media before the experiment. The DiZPK stock solution can be stored at −20°C for three months.\nCritical: Fresh cell growth media should be added into the cells carefully to avoid cell detachment.\nSplit the transfection mixtures equally for the wells to be transfected. Add the transfection mixtures prepared in step 16 dropwise into the cell media.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C/5% CO2 for additional 16–24 h.\nRemove the media and add 1 mL of sterilized PBS carefully into each well.\nSubject the “+UV” sample plate to UV irradiation at 365 nm on ice for 10 min using a Spectrolinker XL-1000 UV crosslinker at a distance of ~3 cm for in-cell photo-crosslinking. Meanwhile, preserve cells of the “-UV” group in the dark.\nCollect the cells into microcentrifuge tubes by repeated pipetting with 1 mL tips. Also collect the cells in “-UV” control plate into microcentrifuge tubes. Wash the cells with PBS twice as described in steps 6 and 7 and finally remove the supernatant.\nPause Point: The cell pellets can be stored at −80°C for at least several months.\nLyse the cells and analyze the lysates with western blotting as described in steps 8–13.\nNote: Western blotting analysis is used to evaluate protein photo-crosslinking of DiZPK-modified POI. High-molecular weight bands that are only present in UV-irradiated samples indicate putative photo-crosslinked interacting proteins of POI. As an example, the result for photo-crosslinking of DiZPK-modified IFITM3 is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B.\nPhoto-Crosslinking Proteomics for Identification of POI-Interacting Proteins in HEK293T Cells\nTiming: 4–5 days",
    "Cells expressing DiZPK-modified POI are photo-crosslinked and lysed for affinity purification and quantitative SILAC proteomic identification (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). Candidate interacting proteins (CIPs) of the POI are identified and quantified in the proteomic analysis.\nCell Preparation.\nCulture two 150-mm dishes of light SILAC HEK293T cells and two 150-mm dishes of heavy SILAC HEK293T cells until ~80% confluency.\nCritical: It is recommended to perform two sets of proteomic experiments for one amber mutant of POI by switching the SILAC labels and UV treatment conditions (termed “forward” and “reverse” SILAC experiments) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) in order to eliminate potential false-positives and increase identification reliability. Therefore, for proteomic analysis of one amber mutant, two dishes of light and heavy SILAC cells should be prepared respectively.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/185-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Experimental Design of the Quantitative SILAC Proteomic Analysis\n(A) Schematic for forward SILAC experiment. Heavy SILAC cells are UV-irradiated, while light SILAC cells are not UV-irradiated.\n(B) Schematic for forward SILAC experiment. Light SILAC cells are UV-irradiated, while heavy SILAC cells are not UV-irradiated.\nTransfect the cells with Jetprime. Prepare the transfection mixture of a POI amber mutant for each dish as follows: (i) Dilute 10 μg of plasmid encoding an amber mutant of POI (e.g., pCMV-POI-X-TAG-HA) and 10 μg of pCMV-DiZPK-PylRS in 1 mL of Jetprime buffer for one 150-mm dish in a microcentrifuge tube. (ii) Add 60 μL of Jetprime to the diluted DNA. (iii) Mix the solution by gently pipetting and incubate the solution for 20–30 min at room temperature (20°C–28°C).\nCritical: The concentrations of plasmid stocks used for transfection are normally around 500 ng/μL.\nCritical: Jetprime should be used for transfection of SILAC cells, as the Jetprime buffer does not contain amino acids. By contrast, the amino acids in Opti-MEM may decrease the isotope labeling levels in heavy SILAC cells.",
    "During incubation, replace the cell culture media respectively with 20 mL of fresh light and heavy SILAC media supplemented with 1 mM DiZPK per dish.\nCritical: DiZPK is dissolved in DMSO at 500 mM as the stock solution, which is diluted with fresh cell growth media before the experiment. The DiZPK stock solution can be stored at −20°C for three months.\nCritical: Fresh cell media should be added into the cells carefully to avoid cell detachment.\nAdd the transfection mixtures prepared in step 24b dropwise into the cell media.\nNote: All dishes are transfected in the presence of DiZPK.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C/5% CO2 for additional 20 h.\nRemove the media and add 10 mL of sterilized PBS carefully into each dish.\nTreat one dish of light SILAC cells and one dish of heavy SILAC cells with UV irradiation at 365 nm on ice at a distance of ~3 cm for 10 min using a Spectrolinker XL-1000 UV crosslinker for in-cell photo-crosslinking.\nNote: The rest dishes are not treated with UV irradiation and serve as non-photo-crosslinking controls.\nCritical: In “forward” SILAC experiment, heavy-labeled cells are irradiated with UV while light-labeled cells are not. Alternatively, in “reverse” SILAC experiment, light-labeled cells are irradiated with UV while heavy-labeled cells are not (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nHarvest the cells by repeated pipetting into 15-mL centrifuge tubes. Also harvest the cells that are not UV-irradiated. Centrifuge to collect the cells at 1,000 × g for 3 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and wash the cells with PBS twice. Use centrifugation with 1,000 × g at 4°C for 3 min to collect the cells between washes. In the last wash, transfer the cells into microcentrifuge tubes. Discard the supernatant after the last wash.",
    "Pause Point: The cell pellets can be stored at −80°C for at least several months.\nCell Lysis.\nFor cells harvested from one 150-mm dish, add 200 μL of 4% SDS lysis buffer supplemented with Roche EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail and benzonase.\nLyse cells with vigorous vortex and sonication. Leave the lysates on bench for ~30 min.\nNote: The lysates should be clear and not sticky.\nNote: Harsh denaturing conditions (i.e., 4% SDS) are used for cell lysis to break non-covalent protein-protein interactions of POI.\nCentrifugate cell lysates at 12,000 × g for 20 min at room temperature (20°C–28°C) to remove cell debris.\nUse a standard BCA assay to quantify the protein concentrations.\nNote: For one 150-mm dish, 5–10 mg protein should be obtained.\nOptional: Take 50 μg of each sample for SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis to confirm expression and photo-crosslinking of POI as described in steps 11–14.\nAffinity Purification.\nTake equal amounts (e.g., 7.5 mg) of light and heavy cell lysates based on protein concentrations, and mix them in 15-mL centrifuge tubes. Dilute the mixtures with 4% SDS lysis buffer to total 400 μL.\nCritical: In “forward” SILAC experiment, UV-irradiated heavy cell lysates are equally mixed with non-irradiated light cell lysates. In “reverse” SILAC experiment, UV-irradiated light cell lysates are equally mixed with non-irradiated heavy cell lysates (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nCritical: The mixtures should be normalized to an equal volume with 4% SDS lysis buffer.\nAdd 7.6 mL of Triton X-100 buffer to each of the mixture. Mix by vortexing gently.\nCritical: Addition of Triton X-100 buffer dilutes the concentration of SDS for subsequent affinity purification.\nResuspend the anti-HA magnetic beads in the bottle with gentle vortex and transfer 1.5 mL of bead slurry (10 mg/mL) per sample from the bottle with a 1-mL pipette to a 15-mL centrifuge tube.",
    "Note: The actual amount of anti-HA magnetic beads should be titrated to ensure depletion of over 80% of the POI.\nPlace the tubes on the magnet to separate the beads and remove the supernatant.\nWash the beads three times with 5 mL PBST by adding the PBST and gentle vortexing. In the last wash, place the tubes on the magnet to separate the beads and remove the supernatant.\nCritical: A magnet is recommended to separate the beads. Centrifugation should not be used for this purpose, as it may cause aggregation of the beads and impact antigen binding.\nTransfer the cell lysates prepared in step 26b to the washed beads.\nIncubate with end-over-end rotation at 4°C for 1.5 h.\nPulse spin the centrifuge tubes to bring down mixtures around the tubes and lids. Place the tubes on the magnet to separate the beads and remove the supernatant.\nAdd 5 mL of pre-chilled RIPA buffer to the beads and incubate with end-over-end rotation at 4°C for 5 min.\nCritical: The RIPA buffer should be pre-chilled on ice.\nPulse spin the centrifuge tubes to bring down mixtures around the tubes and lids. Place the tubes on the magnet to separate the beads and remove the supernatant.\nWash the beads four more times as described in steps 26i and 26j and finally remove the supernatant.\nNote: Multiple washes with RIPA buffer decrease non-specific binding proteins and non-covalent interacting proteins of POI. A total of five washes is recommended.\nAdd 500 μL of 0.5 M NH4OH to the beads and vortex at 37°C for 30 min.\nNote: Treatment with NH4OH dissociates POI and its interacting proteins from the beads.\nPlace the tubes on the magnet to separate the beads and collect the eluates into 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tubes.",
    "Repeat the elution as in steps 26l and 26m and pool the eluates together.\nDry the pooled eluates by Speedvac.\nPause Point: The protein samples can be stored at −80°C for at least several weeks.\nIn-gel digestion.\nAdd 40 μL of 1 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer into each sample and vortex to dissolve the residues.\nAdd 1 μL of DTT stock solution (400 mM) to a final concentration of 10 mM and incubate at 37°C for 30 min.\nCritical: DTT should be freshly prepared in deionized water.\nAdd 2 μL of iodoacetamide stock solution (1 M) into each sample and incubate in the dark at room temperature (20°C–28°C) for another 30 min.\nCritical: Iodoacetamide should be freshly prepared in deionized water.\nLoad 40 μL protein mixture for each sample onto a 4%–20% Tris-HCl gel and separate the samples by electrophoresis.\nCritical: It is recommended to use gels with large sample loading volumes. Alternatively, run the samples in multiple adjacent lanes and cut the gels across these lanes in steps 27f and 27g.\nCritical: For gels to be cut for proteomic analysis, blank lanes should be placed between samples to prevent cross-contamination during gel electrophoresis and slicing. Blanks should contain 1 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer.\nCritical: The gels can be run halfway down to save time.\nCritical: A fraction of the protein mixture for each sample can be saved for immunoblotting to confirm isolation of POI and photo-crosslinked complexes.\nStain the gel with GelCode Blue Stain reagent for 1 h and destain with deionized water for another 1 h.\nAlternatives: Other gel staining reagents that are compatible with in-gel digestion and mass spectrometry such as Coomassie Brilliant Blue reagent can also be used.\nCritical: To minimize contamination, do all staining and destaining steps in a sterile 150-mm tissue culture dish.",
    "Note: In-gel digestion is next performed as previously reported for LC-MS/MS analysis (Shevchenko et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nPause Point: The gel can be destained in deionized water with overnight (e.g., 10–12 h) incubation.\nTransfer the gel to a clean 150-mm tissue culture dish and excise the sample lanes of interest from the gel with a fresh scalpel or razor blade.\nCut the lanes into 5–6 slices and cut each slice into 1 × 1 mm pieces. Transfer the gel pieces into labeled 1.5-mL Lobind Eppendorf tubes.\nAdd 300 μL of 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer into each tube to wash the gel pieces. Remove the supernatant using a 1-mL tip with a 200-μL tip on the end.\nCritical: Make ammonium bicarbonate buffer freshly daily and discard after use.\nCritical: The gel pieces may be lost through 1-mL tips, so a 200-μL tip on the end should be used.\nAdd 500 μL of destaining buffer into each tube to destain the gel pieces. Shake the tubes for 15–30 min until gel pieces become colorless. Spin down the gel pieces at 1,000 × g for 1 min at room temperature (20°C–28°C) and discard the supernatant.\nCritical: If the gel pieces are still blue, repeat the destaining in step 27i.\nCritical: The supernatant should be removed using a 1-mL tip with a 200-μL tip on the end.\nAdd 500 μL of acetonitrile into each tube to dehydrate the gel pieces. Shake the tubes for 10 min at room temperature (20°C–28°C) until gel pieces shrink and become completely white. Spin down the gel pieces at 1,000 × g for 1 min and discard the supernatant.\nDry the gel pieces in a Speedvac for 1 h.\nCritical: The gel pieces are shrunken, white, and completely free of acetonitrile after Speedvac.",
    "Add 100–200 μL of trypsin solution into each tube to cover the dry gel pieces. Leave the tube on ice for 30 min to allow rehydration of gel pieces.\nCritical: There should be enough trypsin solution to cover all gel pieces. If required, add more trypsin buffer to cover the gel pieces.\nIncubate at 37°C overnight (e.g., 10–12 h) with gentle mixing in a Thermomixer for trypsin digestion.\nSpin down the gel pieces at 1,000 × g for 1 min at room temperature (20°C–28°C).\nAdd 200–600 μL of extraction buffer into each tube depending on gel piece sizes and incubate at room temperature (20°C–28°C) for 30 min in a shaker.\nCritical: The volume of extraction buffer should be at least twice of the trypsin solution in step 27l. If too little extraction buffer is used, the peptides may not be extracted out of the gel pieces. If too much extraction buffer is used, the total volume of extraction buffer may be too large for a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new 1.5-mL Lobind Eppendorf tube.\nNote: The supernatant contains the peptides to be analyzed.\nAdd another 200–600 μL of extraction buffer into each tube depending on gel piece sizes and incubate at room temperature (20°C–28°C) for 30 min in a shaker.\nCritical: The volume of extraction buffer should be at least twice of the trypsin solution in step 27l.\nTransfer the supernatant to the tube in step 27p and pool the peptide samples.\nDry the peptide samples in a Speedvac for several hours.\nPause Point: The peptide samples can be stored at −20°C for a few weeks.\nProteomic Analysis.\nResuspend the tryptic peptides in 20 μL of 1% formic acid.",
    "Load the samples onto a 75 μm × 15 cm C18 reverse-phase column. Spray the eluted peptides into an Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer with a nano-ESI source. The setting parameters for nano-LC and mass spectrometer are described in Materials and Equipment.\nSearch and analyze the acquired tandem MS spectra against Uniprot complete human database concatenated with common known contaminants using MaxQuant software (Cox and Mann, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). Typical parameters used for searching data are listed in Materials and Equipment.\nAnalyze the search results with Perseus (Tyanova et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). Remove the proteins identified as known contaminants or reverse hits in Perseus.\nNote: Known contaminants and reverse hits are identified and marked by MaxQuant software (Cox and Mann, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nTransform the SILAC ratios in forward and reverse experiments with log2 transformation. Plot the SILAC ratios in forward and reverse experiments with Excel.\nNote: The SILAC ratios in forward and reverse experiments are used to filter out the CIPs. Protein hits identified to have high SILAC ratios in the forward experiment and meanwhile have low SILAC ratios in the reverse experiment are considered to be CIPs of the POI. As an example, the result for photo-crosslinking proteomic analysis of DiZPK-modified IFITM3 is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C, which suggests VCP (Meyer et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) as a primary CIP of IFITM3.\nValidation of Photo-Crosslinking Complexes of POI\nTiming: 3 days\nCells co-expressing DiZPK-modified POI and a CIP identified in proteomic analysis are photo-crosslinked and lysed for affinity purification and western blotting to validate the interaction and formation of the photo-crosslinking complex (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). Upon photo-crosslinking, a high-molecular-weight band corresponding to the covalent complex of POI and CIP is observed in western blot.",
    "Clone the gene of CIP into a mammalian expression vector containing an affinity tag (e.g., myc tag) and generate the expression plasmid for CIP, e.g., pCMV-myc-CIP. Mutate the original stop codon TAG to TAA or TGA or 3xTAA if needed.\nCritical: The affinity tag on CIP should be orthogonal to that on POI. For example, FLAG or myc tag can be used.\nCritical: It is recommended to change the intrinsic amber stop codon (i.e., TAG) of CIP into ochre or opal stop codon (i.e., TAA or TGA) in order to avoid read-through in the amber suppression system.\nSeed HEK293T cells in 60-mm dishes with normal growth medium and incubate the cells at 37°C/5% CO2 for 12–18 h.\nCheck cell confluency the next day and transfect the cells with Xtremegene 9 at ~80% confluency. Prepare transfection complexes as follows: (i) Dilute 4 μg of plasmid encoding an amber mutant of POI (e.g., pCMV-POI-X-TAG-HA), 4 μg of plasmid encoding pCMV-myc-CIP, and 4 μg of pCMV-DiZPK-PylRS in 1 mL of Opti-MEM for two dishes to be transfected in a microcentrifuge tube. (ii) Add 36 μL of Xtremegene 9 to the diluted DNA. (iii) Mix the solution by gently pipetting and incubate the solution for 20–30 min at room temperature (20°C–28°C).\nCritical: The concentrations of plasmid stocks used for transfection are normally around 500 ng/μL.\nCritical: The transfection mixtures are prepared for two 60-mm dishes, one dish for “+UV” sample and the other for “-UV” control. The transfection mixtures are split equally into two dishes in step 33.\nCritical: Other transfection reagents that are applicable for HEK293T cells can also be used, such as Jetprime.\nDuring incubation, replace the cell culture media with 3 mL of fresh cell growth media supplemented with 1 mM DiZPK per dish.",
    "Critical: DiZPK is dissolved in DMSO at 500 mM as the stock solution, which is diluted with fresh cell growth media before the experiment. The DiZPK stock solution can be stored at −20°C for three months.\nCritical: Fresh cell growth media should be added into the cells carefully to avoid cell detachment.\nSplit the transfection mixtures equally for the dishes to be transfected. Add the transfection mixtures prepared in step 31 dropwise into the cell media.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C/5% CO2 for additional 16–24 h.\nRemove the media and add 2 mL of sterilized PBS carefully into each dish.\nSubject the “+UV” sample dish to UV irradiation at 365 nm on ice for 10 min using a Spectrolinker XL-1000 UV crosslinker at a distance of ~3 cm for in-cell photo-crosslinking. Meanwhile, preserve cells of the “-UV” control in the dark.\nHarvest the cells into 15-mL centrifuge tubes by repeated pipetting with 1-mL tips. Also harvest the cells in “-UV” control plate into 15-mL centrifuge tubes. Centrifuge the cells with 1,000 × g at 4°C for 3 min and remove the supernatant.\nAdd 1 mL of PBS into the tubes and transfer the cells into 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tubes. Wash the cells with PBS twice as described in steps 6 and 7 and finally remove the supernatant.\nPause Point: The cell pellets can be stored at −80°C for at least several months.\nFor cells harvested from one 60-mm dish, add 50 μL 4% SDS lysis buffer supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail and benzonase.\nLyse cells with vigorous vortex and sonication. Leave the lysates on bench for ~30 min.\nNote: The lysates should be clear and not sticky.\nNote: Harsh denaturing conditions (i.e., 4% SDS) are used for cell lysis to break non-covalent protein-protein interactions of POI.",
    "Centrifugate cell lysates at 12,000 × g for 20 min at room temperature (20°C–28°C) to remove cell debris.\nUse a standard BCA assay to quantify the protein concentrations.\nDispense equal amount of proteins for each sample into 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tubes. Dilute each protein sample with 4% SDS lysis buffer to total 50 μL.\nCritical: Take 50 μg of each sample for SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis to confirm the expression of POI and CIP.\nCritical: The mixtures should be normalized to an equal volume with 4% SDS lysis buffer.\nAdd 950 μL of Triton X-100 buffer to each sample. Mix by vortexing gently.\nCritical: Addition of Triton X-100 buffer dilutes the concentration of SDS for subsequent affinity purification.\nCarry out anti-HA affinity purification with anti-HA magnetic beads (~0.3 mL bead slurry) as described in steps 26c–26k, and wash the beads with pre-chilled RIPA buffer five times.\nAdd 25 μL 1× SDS loading buffer supplemented with 2-ME (5% final concentration) into each sample. Vortex vigorously and heat the samples at 95°C for 5 min using a heating block.\nPlace the microcentrifuge tubes on the magnet to separate the beads.\nLoad 20 μL of each sample onto a 4%–20% Tris-HCl gel and separate the proteins by electrophoresis. Transfer proteins from the gel onto a nitrocellulose membrane and probe for the CIP using the antibody against the affinity tag (e.g., myc tag) with standard immunoblotting techniques.",
    "Note: Western blotting analysis for CIP is used to assess the co-immunoprecipitation of CIP and formation of the slower-migrating photo-crosslinking complex between CIP and POI. As the CIP and photo-crosslinking complex are present in low abundance, majority of the eluent in steps 46 and 47 should be analyzed using the antibody against CIP. As an example, the result for validation of IFITM3-VCP interaction and photo-crosslinking is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D.\nLoad 5 μL of each sample onto another 4%–20% Tris-HCl gel and separate the proteins by electrophoresis. Transfer proteins from the gel onto a nitrocellulose membrane and probe for the POI using the antibody against the affinity tag (e.g., HA tag) with standard immunoblotting techniques.\nNote: Western blotting analysis for POI is used to assess the expression and photo-crosslinking of DiZPK-modified POI. As the POI are enriched and present in very high abundance, a small quantity of the eluent in steps 46 and 47 should be analyzed using the antibody against POI. As an example, the result for IFITM3 expression and photo-crosslinking in validation of IFITM3-VCP interaction is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D.\nCritical: The photo-crosslinking complex of CIP and POI may not be observed on the western blot against POI, due to its relatively low abundance compared to POI."
