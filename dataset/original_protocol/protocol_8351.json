    "1. Preparation of Instruments and Insect\nPreparing tungsten electrodes and stimuli solutions\nFix a new tungsten wire (diameter of 0.125 mm, length of 75 mm) into a micromanipulator and sharpen it in a 10% (w/v) sodium nitrite (NaNO2) solution in a syringe at 10 V provided by a power supply for about 1 min under a stereomicroscope (40X magnification).\nDip the sharpened tungsten wire repeatedly into the 10% NaNO2 solution, about 4 mm at 5 V in < 1 min (Figure 1A).\nExamine the diameter of the sharpened tungsten tip frequently under the stereomicroscope until it is fine enough to penetrate the cuticle of a locust palp olfactory sensillum (Figure 1B).\nPrepare the stimulus solutions. Dilute each of the chemical stimulus substance in mineral oil. Dilute 1-nonanol and nonanoic acid at 10% dilutions. Dilute E-2-hexenal and hexanal at 10-2, 10-3, 10-4, and 10-5.\nPrepare Pasteur tubes carrying the stimuli: insert filter paper strips (length of 2 cm, width of 0.5 cm) into the Pasteur tubes, add the diluted stimulus solutions (each 10 µl) to the filter paper strips, and then plug the Pasteur tubes with pipette tips (1 ml).\nPrepare the insect\nRear locusts (Locusta migratoria) with fresh wheat seedlings under crowded conditions at a relative humidity of 60%, a temperature of 28 - 30 °C, and a photoperiod of 18:6 h (light:dark). Choose 1- to 3-day-old 5th instar locust nymphs and remove the antennae with fine scissors to avoid any interference when recording.\nPreparing the locust maxillary palp holder",
    "Use a glass slide (25 mm x 75 mm) as the base of the maxillary palp holder (MPH). Attach a plastic piece (1 mm in height, 10 mm in width, 35 mm in length) to a corner of the glass slide with double-sided adhesive tape, and finally fix a cover glass (18 mm x 18 mm) on top of the plastic piece with double-sided adhesive tape. Place a small piece of red rubber tape onto the cover glass as a non-slip layer. The plastic piece and the cover glass constitute the platform for the locust palp. The height of the platform is approximately 1.5 mm.\nInstall a tungsten wire (diameter of 0.125 mm, length of 36 mm) at a distance of 1.5 mm parallel to the inside edge of the platform. Fix the two ends of the wire onto the platform with double-sided adhesive tape.\n2. Preparation of Locust Maxillary Palps\nCut a centrifuge tube (1.5 ml) vertically in half and cut off the bottom. Place the locust into the prepared tube. Leave the ventral region and the head of the locust exposed. Fix the assembly to the glass slide with double-sided adhesive tape (Figure 2A).\nPull the right maxillary palp onto the platform.\nPut the tungsten wire at the fourth segment of the palp. Place adhesive putty on each side of the tungsten wire, about 2 mm from the maxillary palp (Figure 2A and 2B).\n3. Single Sensillum Recordings\nPlace the locust maxillary palp preparation under a microscope at a low magnification (100X). Adjust the position of the preparation until the palp is perpendicular to the recording electrode (Figure 3A).",
    "Insert the reference electrode (tungsten electrode) into the locust eye using a micromanipulator. Move the recording electrode (tungsten electrode) close to the maxillary palp with the micromanipulator (Figure 3B and 3C).\nAdjust the odor delivery device to about 1 cm from the maxillary palp (Figure 3B).\nOpen the recording software Auto Spike 32. Set the recording parameters as follows: the recording scale on 500 µV; the high cutoff of the filter on 300 Hz, the low cutoff on 200 Hz; and the pretrigger on 10 s.\nConnect the recording electrode to a 10x universal AC/DC amplifier.\nSwitch the microscope to a high magnification (500X). Insert the recording electrode into the base of a basiconic sensillum on the maxillary palp and delicately adjust the recording electrode to obtain good spontaneous spikes (Figure 3D).\nOpen the stimulus controller to deliver a continuous air stream at 20 ml/s. Set the stimulation time to 1 s. Record signals for 10 s, starting 10 s before the onset of the stimulus pulse.\nUse a 10x universal AC/DC amplifier to amplify the signals. Feed the signals into the IDAC 4. Analyze the signals with the Auto Spike 32 software. AC signals are band-pass filtered between 200 to 300 Hz. Use Auto Spike 32 to distinguish peak-to-trough amplitudes from noises. Calculate the responses of the neurons as the increases in action potential frequencies (spikes per second) over the spontaneous frequencies. Perform a statistical analysis using GraphPad Prism 7.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
