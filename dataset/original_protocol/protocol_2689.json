    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nRestrain and positioning of the mouse\nTiming: 5 min (for step 1)\nThis section describes how to set up and position the mouse for injection.\nTo remove the fur of the mouse and expose the injection area.\nPut the mouse under anesthesia by gently covering its nose and mouth with the nose cone containing the 5% isoflurane-soaked cotton ball.\nConfirm the mouse is unconscious and does not move in response to stimulus (e.g., gentle pulling of the limbs).\nRemove the fur on the chest with a hair clipper to expose the skin.\nTo restrain and position the mouse for the injection procedure.\nA thin layer of ophthalmic ointment (or Vaseline) is applied to the eyes of the mouse to keep them moist.\nA heat lamp is set up next to the working station to ensure constant body temperature during the procedure.\nPlace the mouse onto the restraint and positioning apparatus, and secure the mouse extremities with surgical adhesive tape on the positioning plate (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2344-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Instructions on mouse placement and the identification of the intrathymic injection sites\n(A) The set-up of the intrathymic injection station.\n(B) The mouse is aligned and secured between the restraint and positioning apparatus.\n(C) The illustration of mouse chest anatomy showing the location of the thymus, the heart, the manubrium, the sternum, and the xiphoid process.\n(D) The reference points and lines are marked to locate the correct injection sites.\nNote: It is recommended to mark the positioning apparatus with a straight line – it helps to align the mouse from nose to tail and avoid tilted positioning (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B).\nContinuous anesthesia during the procedure is provided by keeping the nose cone containing the 5% isoflurane-soaked cotton ball on the mouse.",
    "Note: If a gas anesthesia instrument is available, administer 1% isoflurane mixed with oxygen at the flow rate of 450 mL/min.\nDisinfect the mouse chest with 70% isopropyl alcohol.\nInjection\nTiming: 10 min (for step 5)\nHere we describe how to draw the reference lines to identify the correction injection sites and perform the injection.\nTo draw the reference lines with a marker on the mouse chest to identify the injection sites.\nNote: The injection sites are located in the first intercostal space on both sides of the sternum. The relative position of the sternum and the thymus are shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C.\nFind the sternum by gently touching the mouse’s chest with the fingers, then draw the central line in the middle of the sternum (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D, line A).\nLocate the manubrium and draw a circle to label the upper edge of the chest (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D, circle B).\nLocate the xiphoid process and draw a circle to label the bottom of the chest (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D, circle C). The manubrium (circle B) is approximately 15 mm away from the xiphoid process (circle C).\nUse circle B as a reference point, and draw the extension lines at 45˚ angle at both left and right sides of the chest (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D, line D and E).\nTake a ruler and move perpendicularly along line A. The injection sites are estimated to be 0.75 ± 0.25 mm away from line A at the intersection of line D and E, respectively.\nNote: We do not recommend using younger or older than 5-6 weeks-old mice for intrathymic injection. The mouse thymus reaches a growth plateau at 5–6 weeks old and will start undergoing involution thereafter. The parameters provided in this protocol are optimized for this age of mice specifically.",
    "Place the restraint plate over the mouse’s chest to provide a mild restriction of chest movement and create a stable injection platform.\nNote: The acrylic plates only aim to provide minimal restriction of chest movement. The plate should be supported by the nuts installed on the bolt instead of directly compressing the mouse chest. Ensure it is not pressing down too hard to affect normal mouse breathing.\nLoad 15 μL of the injection solution to the 29G BD insulin syringe.\nNote: Avoid bubbles in the syringe. The maximum injected volume allowed is 20 μL. In our experience, injection with a volume larger than 20 μL often results in tissue damage and blood clotting in the thymus.\nInstall the constraint cap on the syringe to help determine the depth of the injection.\nPosition the needle perpendicularly to the injection site, and push the needle in until the constraint cap touches the chest.\nNote: A new needle should be used for every injection of each mouse.\nNote: The intrathymic injection method published by de la Cueva T. et al. requires an incision of the skin and uses an injection angle of 30˚ with a specific depth of tissue penetration by reference to the length of the needle’s bevel. In practice, we find it rather difficult to achieve – the operator needs to steadily remain the desirable injection angle while making sure the needle does not go too shallow or deep into the tissue. The technique we describe here avoids these obstacles by applying the injection perpendicularly to the mouse chest with the defined penetration depth achieved by the constraint cap.",
    "Critical: The needle should not be pushed further as soon as the constraint cap touches the mouse's chest. Just touching the mouse's chest with the constraint cap helps to deliver the tip of the needle at the proper depth into the thymic tissue.\nSlowly push the plunger to deliver the injection solution into the thymic lobe, wait for 5 s, then gently withdraw the needle (please see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]: Intrathymic injection).\nCritical: If clear traces of blood are observed when withdrawing the needle, the injection has likely failed and punctured the heart. The mouse should be immediately euthanized by carbon dioxide (CO2) inhalation.\nRepeat steps 7–10 to inject the second thymic lobe.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. The procedure of intrathymic injection with Indian ink, related to step 10\nRecovery and analysis\nTiming: 30 min to 1 h (for step 12)\nPost-injection care and exemplary analysis are provided in this section.\nRemove the nose cone from the mouse to end the exposure to isoflurane.\nKeep the mouse under the heat lamp and allow it to recover from anesthesia.\nClosely monitor the behavior of the injected mouse for at least 1 h.\nNote: Mice should be euthanized when showing signs of distress or pain, including weakness, abnormal respiration rate, continuous trembling, or lethargy.\nDepending on the experimental design, euthanize the mouse by carbon dioxide inhalation and harvest the thymus for further analysis at the desirable time points.",
    "Note: The Indian ink can clearly label the injection spot in the thymus tissue for at least five days. Nevertheless, the injection spot becomes smaller 5 days post-injection, suggesting the longer incubation time may result in the diffusion of the dye. Therefore, we suggest using the Indian ink as a reference for the intrathymic injection only if the tissue is harvested within 5 days. Injections performed more than 5 days before the thymus harvest cannot be visually verified.\nThe thymus is harvested 6 h post-intrathymic injection and is subjected to flow cytometric analysis to determine the overall impact of the procedure.\nThe single cell suspension is prepared, washed with PBS, and re-suspended in FACS buffer (PBS with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 2 mM EDTA) containing propidium iodide for viability analysis."
