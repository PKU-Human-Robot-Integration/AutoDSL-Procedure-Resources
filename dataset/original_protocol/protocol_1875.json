    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMouse irradiation\nTiming: Approximately 20 min\nThis step describes the key operations for total body irradiation of NCG pups.\nTurn on and pre-heat the irradiator.\n4–6 days old pups (no more than 15 pups) from a ventilated cage along with some bedding were transferred into one autoclaved plastic box, then close the box lid (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1468-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. The irradiation process of pups\n(A) Transfer pups from a ventilated cage into an autoclaved box.\n(B) A plastic box with the lid closed.\n(C) Irradiate the pups using a RS-2000 Rad Source Irradiator.\nCritical: The operation should be conducted under a biological safety cabinet. And the following irradiation process should be finished within 30 min. Otherwise, pups would be suffocated.\nWrap the individual box with autoclaved paper bags and take it out of the facility.\nNote: If the irradiator is inside the animal facility, jump steps 3 and 7, and follow the procedure dictates of the facility.\nPut the plastic boxes one at a time into the irradiator (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nSet the sub-lethal irradiation dose (63 s, 70 cGy X-ray for NCG mice) and start the irradiation process.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1468_6.csv",
    "Critical: The immunodeficient mouse strains for HIS mice generation could be typically classified into SCID mice or Rag mice regarding to their mutation of Prkdc or Rag1/Rag2 respectively. SCID mice are sensitive to irradiation due to their mutation in Prkdc(Biedermann et al., 1991[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]), whereas Rag mice are relatively resistant to irradiation. Thus, precautions need to be taken when choosing a starting irradiation dose for optimization. The reported sublethal doses of mouse pups from different strains are listed (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). As indicated, for SCID mice, the sublethal irradiation dose test should be set between 60 and 110 cGy, e.g., 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110 cGy. While for Rag mice the initial dose for sublethal irradiation escalation test should start from 2 Gy, e.g., 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4 Gy.\nTake out the plastic box when the radiation process finishes and move on to irradiate the next one.\nRemove paper bags when entering the animal facility.\nTransfer the plastic boxes carrying irradiated pups into a biological safety cabinet and open the lids.\nNote: Avoid introducing foreign scents or contaminations during the process. Otherwise, the parental mice may kill or stop feeding the pups.\nRecovery of CD34+ HSCs from cryopreservation\nTiming: 30 min\nTake out one vial of previously cryopreserved CD34+ HSCs from liquid nitrogen (put the tube in liquid nitrogen or dry ice if transfer process is required) and immediately put it into a 37°C water bath.\nQuickly thaw the cells by gently swirling the vial in the water bath.\nTake out the vial and spray it with 70% ethanol and then transfer it into a biological safety cabinet.\nOpen the vial and transfer the cells into a centrifuge tube containing 10 mL pre-warmed cell medium.",
    "Count the live cells using 0.4% trypan blue solution (dilute the sample at 1:1 ration) with a KOVA™ Glasstic™ Slide under microscopy.\nCentrifuge the cells at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nCarefully aspirate the upper supernatant and resuspend cells to the concentration of 105 cells/50 μL with RPMI 1640 injection medium.\nIntrahepatic HSC injections\nTiming: Approximately 1–2 h, about 2 min per mouse\nLoad a 29 gauge 1 mL BD insulin syringe with resuspended HSCs.\nTake one pup and hold it head down with fingers applying gentle pressure to restrict the movement of pups and expose the abdomen. Then the red-colored liver can be seen just adjacent to the white-colored stomach (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1468-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Posture for intrahepatic injection\nHold the syringe with the other hand and insert the needle at a 45-degree angle into the pup’s liver about 3 mm depth.\nNote: Always follow the role of handling sharps and needles during the process.\nInject 50 μL medium slowly into the liver and hold still for 3 s.\nRelease the pressure of your fingers from the injected pups, then pull out the needle slowly and put the pups back to the plastic box.\nRepeat the above steps until all the injections are finished.\nWean HIS mice at 21 days old and wait for 10 weeks after the HSCs injection before further humanization level analysis.\nNote: It takes effort and practice to be proficient at intrahepatic injection, starting from practicing with culture medium/PBS instead of HSCs.\nFlow cytometry analysis of humanization level\nFlow cytometry analysis of the blood of HIS mice is a convenient and standard approach to obtain the humanization information. This section describes the detailed steps on humanization level determination, including the blood collection and the further immune phenotype analysis using flow cytometry.",
    "Facial vein bleeding of HIS mice\nTiming: About 1 min per mouse\nThis step describes the blood draw from HIS mice. Drawing blood from mouse facial veins is routinely employed in our facility. Alternative methods such as retro-orbital blood collection and blood collection from the tail are also applicable. We choose facial vein bleeding method over retro-orbital and tail vein bleeding as this approach causes less stress to the mice and cost less time than other approaches.\nTake one HIS mouse out of the cage and properly restrain it with one hand.\nNote: Properly restraining the mice and applying adequate pressure to the maxillary vein is a prerequisite for a smooth blood draw.\nVisualize the mark of the maxillary vein: albino NCG mouse has an obvious mark for the maxillary vein, which is viewed as a small bald spot (shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). The maxillary vein is just under this spot.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1468-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Drawing blood from the submandibular vein\n(A) Red arrow indicates the bald area where the submandibular vein locates.\n(B) Insert the needle directly into the bald area.\n(C) Peripheral blood comes out of the submandibular vein.\nPuncture it with a 23 gauge needle, withdraw the needle quickly and then collect 50 μL blood using an anticoagulant tube (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 3C).\nApply gentle pressure with an alcohol pad on the site of the puncture to stop the bleeding.\nDispose the needle into a sharps/biohazard container.\nRepeat the above steps until the blood draw of all the mice is finished.\nNote: Always use a new sterile needle to bleed each HIS mouse. Do not share needles for different mice to avoid cross-contamination.\nFACS analysis of the blood samples\nTiming: Approximately 1–2 h, it takes about 2 h for 20 mice",
    "Prepare fluorescent antibody cocktail containing the antibodies in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1468_7.csv\nNote: For a basic detection of human immune cell reconstruction level, antibodies against human CD45, human B cells (CD19/CD20), T cells (CD3) as well as mouse CD45 are necessary. The choice of antibody fluorochrome conjugates in this protocol is optimized for flow cytometer available in our facility. As such, antibody panels should be adjusted according to the parameter of the available flow cytometer.\nAdd 6 μL/well antibody cocktail into a 96 well round bottom plate.\nTransfer 50 μL of blood from each blood sample to the 96 well round bottom plate and incubate for 30 min at 4°C, protecting from light.\nDilute 10× BD FACS™ Lysing Solution to 1× with ddH20, then add 200 μL lysing buffer to each sample after the antibody staining process and incubate for 10 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nSpin the plate at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nNote: Repeat the lysing process if there are red blood cells remaining. Alternatively, the red blood cells can be lysed with ACK (RBC lysis buffer) first and then proceed for antibody staining process.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 200 μL of ice cold FACS buffer or cell buffer.\nTransfer the cell suspension into a flow tube by passing through a 70 μm cell strainer.\nStore the samples on ice and wait for further flow cytometry acquisition.\nAcquire the samples to collect the desired volume of sample using available flow cytometer.\nNote: For detailed guidelines and description of flow cytometer set-up when performing flow cytometry experiments please refer to (Cossarizza et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Prosser et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]; Rico et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18])",
    "Analyze FCS files using flow cytometry analysis software. We routinely use NovoExpress Software or FlowJo for flow cytometer data analysis (a gating strategy is shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1468-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Gating strategy for FACS analysis of blood samples from HIS mice\nDetermine the cell number of human CD45 (hCD45) per mL blood as：\n   c e l l  n u m b e r  p e r  m l =   c e l l  c o u n t  o f  h C D 45  f r o m  a c q u i r e d  s a m p l e    a c q u i r e d  v o u l m e  p e r  s a m p l e   × t o t a l  v o l u m e  p e r  s a m p l e × 20 .  \nNote: Here, 20 is the quotient of 1000 μl/50 μl blood.\nAnd calculate the humanization levels of the HIS mice using the following formula:\n %  o f  h u m a n i z a t i o n  l e v e l =   %  o f  h C D 45   %  o f  h C D 45 + %  o f  m C D 45   × 100  % . \nThe HIS mouse with a hCD45 cell number above 105/mL or a humanization level above 10% is used for further experiments. And HIS mice assigned to different groups should have matched gender and similar humanization levels.\nHydrodynamic injection\nTiming: Steps 40–41 take about 20 min and steps 42–49 cost about 1 min per mouse",
    "Hydrodynamic injection is a procedure to express proteins of interest in mouse liver by rapid injection of large volume of plasmids DNA solution into the tail vein of mouse. The following steps describe the detailed procedures for hydrodynamic injection, including plasmids solution preparation and tips for the injection.\nPrepare the plasmid solution using a 50 mL tube as shown in Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1468_8.csv\nNote: The values for A and B are determined follows: A- The amounts of plasmids injected positively correlate with protein expression levels. But the range of protein expression varies considerably and need to be individually determined. B- Typically, a maxi-prep would yield a stock plasmid concentration of 500 μg/ml to 1500 μg /ml.\nCritical: Plasmids should be endotoxin-free. Otherwise, it would lead to mouse death after injection.\nWeigh the mice and prepare the injection solution as shown in Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1468_9.csv\nLoad the injection solution to a 2.5 mL syringe with a 26 gauge needle.\nCritical: Tap the syringe to remove all the air bubbles in the syringe.\nPre-heat the mice with a heat lamp for 15 min to increase the visibility of the lateral caudal veins.\nPut one HIS mouse in a restraining device and firmly immobilize the mouse (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1468-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Hydrodynamic injection\n(A) Ensure the mouse still can breathe freely after being restrained in the immobilizer.\n(B) Insert the needle into the later tail vein and finish the injection within 7 s.\nNote: Make sure the mouse still breathes freely.\nPull and straighten the tail of the mouse with your non-dominant hand.\nHold the syringe by the other hand with the bevel of the needle facing upward and nearly parallel to the lateral caudal vein, then insert the needle smoothly into the vein (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).",
    "Inject the solution quickly within 7 s, otherwise, the transfection efficiency would be extremely low.\nNote: Always start the injection from the tip of the tail to ensure that more attempts could be carried out. If the solution cannot be injected completely at a single injection, inject the remaining solution again into the other later tail vein immediately. If two injections cannot be finished within 1 min, the transfection will not be successful. And the mouse should not proceed for further experiments.\nImmediately release the mouse from the restrainer and put it back into the cage.\nCritical: Remove the mouse from the restrainer immediately after the injection, or it may cause mouse death due to suffocation. The mouse may remain motionless for 10–30 min after hydrodynamic injection due to temporary arrhythmia. Usually, the mouse will recover within 10 min. On the condition that the breathing of the mouse turns out to be really shallow, gently massage the abdomen of the mouse to facilitate breathing.\nCollect 100 μL of blood from the submandibular vein 24 h after the hydrodynamic injection as described from steps 23–28.\nCentrifuge the blood at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the blood plasma into a new sterilized 0.5 mL tube.\nStore the blood plasma at −80°C for ELISA analysis.\nNote: ELISA analysis of the plasmid coding protein is done according to the manuals of the corresponding ELISA MAX™ Deluxe Set from Biolegend.\nFACS analysis of human hematopoiesis and immune cells\nTiming: Approximately 2–3 h, it takes about 3 h for 10 mice\nThis part demonstrates the basic analysis of human hematopoiesis and immune cells after hydrodynamic injection. Here we take the HIS mice that receive phIL-10 hydrodynamic injection as an example.",
    "7 days post hydrodynamic injection, mice are sacrificed and the spleens are harvested in a 6 well plate containing 5 mL FACS buffer or cell buffer.\nGently mince the spleen through a 100 μm cell strainer with a 5 mL syringe piston.\nTransfer the splenocytes into 15 mL centrifuge tubes and spin at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL Red Blood Cell Lysing Buffer Hybri-Max, incubating the cells at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 10 min.\nAdd 9 mL FACS buffer to stop the lysis and filter the cells into a new 15 mL tube by passing through a 70 μm cell strainer.\nSpin down the cells at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 5 mL FACS buffer.\nCount live cells using 0.4% trypan blue solution (dilute the sample at 1:1 ration) with a KOVA™ Glasstic™ Slide under microscopy.\nAdjust cell concentration and transfer one million live cells per mouse in one well of a 96 well round bottom plate and spin down the cells at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nPrepare the blocking buffer in 50 μL FACS buffer per sample during centrifugation.\nDiscard the supernatant by flicking the plate over a sink.\nResuspend the cells by adding 50 μL blocking buffer and incubate at 4°C for 15 min.\nPrepare the flow antibody mix as the panel in Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1468_10.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1468_11.csv\nNote: The cell subpopulations are defined by cell surface markers according to Table 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6].\nAdd 200 μL ice cold FACS buffer and spin down the cells at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.",
