    "All procedures were approved and supervised by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and adhered to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Bar-Ilan University Guidelines for the Use and Care of Laboratory Animals in Research. This protocol was approved by the National Committee for Experiments in Laboratory Animals at the Ministry of Health.\nNOTE: This protocol utilizes female Long-Evans rats (acute and chronic models) and female Sprague Dawley rats (acute model) aged 3-10 months, 280-350 g. The implementation of these models in other strains, weights or ages should be tested carefully for different reaction.\n1. Acute model\nPre-surgery preparation\nImplant-cannula preparation\n\t\tNOTE: The implant-cannula enables local bicuculline injections into the striatum.\n\t\t\nCut a stainless steel, 25 G (OD 0.02'', ID 0.015'') hypo-tube to obtain an implant-cannula (Figure 1, device #1). Use a rotary tool to achieve straight edges. The length of the cannula depends on the implantation target depth, the angle of cannula implantation, and the final cemented cap height. The implantation target depth needs to be 2 mm (0.079'') higher than the final injection target to prevent tissue damage.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The highest object implanted determines the cap height.\nSand and smooth the implant-cannula edges, preventing additional mechanic friction to the brain. Insert a 30 G (0.01'') needle through it to remove any internal obstructions.\nDummy preparation\n\t\tNOTE: The dummy is a removable internal wire placed inside the implanted cannula. The dummy seals the implanted cannula, thus preventing its obstruction.\n\t\t\nMake a dummy by cutting a 0.013'' wire with a rotary tool. The dummy should be 3 mm (0.118'') longer than the implant-cannula length (Figure 1, device #2).",
    "Insert the dummy into the implant-cannula until it reaches the end. Bend the excess wire by pinching it against the cannula. The bent part should be flush with the implant-cannula to prevent the dummy from falling out of the implanted cannula, and to prevent the rat from removing it.\nInjector preparation\n\t\tNOTE: The injector, composed of a flexible tube and an injection-cannula (Figure 1, device #3), enables direct bicuculline injection into the striatum.\n\t\t\nCut a 70 cm (27.559'') flexible polymer microbore tube (OD 0.06'', ID 0.02'') (Figure 1, device #3.1).\n\t\t\tNOTE: The length of the flexible tube is defined by the distance between the experimental cage and the infusion pump machine location. It must be long enough to enable free movement of the rat during the injection period, but not too long, to avoid the rat getting tangled in it (see Figure 3A).\nCut a stainless steel, 30 G (OD 0.012'', ID 0.007'') hypo-tube to obtain injection-cannula (Figure 1, device #3.2). Use a rotary tool to achieve straight edges. It should measure 5 mm (0.197'') longer than the implant-cannula: 2 mm (0.079'') longer than the implanted cannula within the brain to reach the final injection target, and 3 mm (0.118'') to insert it into the flexible tube.\nSand and smooth the tip of the injection-cannula, preventing additional mechanic friction to the brain. Insert a wire measuring 0.005'' diameter to verify that it is unobstructed.\nInsert 3 mm (0.118'') of the injection-cannula into the flexible tube and glue the joint between them, to obtain an injector. Use cyanoacrylate (CA) glue and CA accelerator.",
    "Attach a syringe with 25 G needle (0.018'') filled with sterile water to the injector and wash it through. This ensures that the flow orientation coming out of the injection-cannula is straight and effortless. Crucially, if the flow is not straight, use the tip of 30 G (OD 0.01'') needle to remove any obstructions and enlarge the injection-cannula hole, and re-verify the flow.\nCannula-holder preparation\n\t\tNOTE: The cannula-holder is connected to the stereotaxic arm and holds the implant cannula during the implantation. The cannula-holder consists of cannula-holder base and cannula-holder lead, which are glued together (Figure 1, device #4). During the implantation, the cannula-holder base is attached to the stereotaxic arm, and the cannula-holder lead is attached to the implant-cannula.\n\t\t\nCannula-holder base: Cut 10 cm (3.947'') of stainless steel, 22 G (OD 0.028'', ID 0.017'') hypo-tube (Figure 1, device #4.1).\nCannula-holder lead: Cut 0.013'' wire to a length of 3 mm (0.118'') longer than the desired implant-cannula (Figure 1, device #4.2).\nInsert the cannula-holder lead into the cannula-holder base and glue the joint between them, using CA glue and CA accelerator. The lead should be 1 mm (0.039'') shorter than the implant-cannula, to avoid tissue damage during implantation.\nBicuculline preparation: dissolve bicuculline methiodide in physiological saline or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) to a final concentration of 1 μg/μL. Divide the dissolved bicuculline into 1 mL syringes, cover with aluminum foil, and freeze at -20 °C until needed. When necessary, thaw the syringe before use.\nSurgery\nInduce initial anesthesia by placing the rat in a designed chamber and deliver 4-5% isoflurane mixed with an oxygen at a rate of0.5-1 L/min. Then, inject the rat intramuscular (IM or IP) with Ketamine and Xylazine (100 and 10 mg/kg, respectively) mixture.\nShave the rat's head using an electric clipper.",
    "Put lidocaine gel in the rat's ears. Put petroleum jelly on the rat's eyes to prevent corneal drying and trauma.\nSecure the rat in the stereotactic frame using ear bars and toothbar.\nSwab the rat's scalp with povidone iodine and then with alcohol wipe to sterilize the area. Infiltrate along the desired incision line with 0.5 - 1% lidocaine solution subcutaneously (SC). Using a scalpel blade, make an incision along the scalp.\nPull the fascia toward the edges to open the surgical area.\nClean the skull with sterile saline, using cotton swabs. In case of bleeding, use a cauterizer to cauterize the blood capillary. This step is crucial for cap stability over time.\nClamp the fascia with four curved hemostats (two anterior, two posterior) to enlarge the surgical site.\nMeasure the bregma and lambda coordinates. Level the dorsoventral (DV) coordinates of the two points, so that they are within a range of 100 µm.\nUsing the stereotaxic apparatus, measure and mark the coordinates of the areas of interest and the anchor screws to be implanted. The straight-implantation cannula coordinates for tic induction in the forelimb area are: AP: +1 to +1.5, mL: ±2.5, DV: 3; hindlimb area: AP: -0.4 to -0.5, mL: ±3.5, DV:318,20.\n\t\tNOTE: In case of the implantation of multiple devices that prevent implanting cannula straight, change the angle of cannula implantation and its coordinates accordingly (forelimb coordinates: AP: +2.7, mL: ±2.5, DV: 3, angle 15° from anterior to posterior).",
    "Drill holes in the skull under the microscope. Use a dental drill machine with 1/4-1/2 bit size carbide round burs. To minimize risks of brain injury, adjust the drill speed according to drilling skills and avoid any mechanic pressure. Drill until the brain is visible, for about 1 mm. Absorb any blood with a cotton swab and wash with sterile saline.\n\t\tNOTE: The anchor screws serve to stabilize the cap. Make sure the screws are located in both hemispheres and along the anterior-posterior axis.\nCannula implantation\n\t\t\nScrew the anchor screws into the holes. Use stainless steel #0 x 1/8 size screws.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The number of anchor screws depends on the total number of implanted devices. Ground screws (e.g. for the electrical recordings or electrical stimulations) should reach the brain surface.\nAttach the cannula-holder to the stereotaxic arm.\nSlide the implant-cannula onto the cannula-holder. Slowly position the implant-cannula above the hole until it reaches the brain.\nMeasure the DV coordinates starting from brain surface. Lower the implant-cannula up to the implantation target. Absorb any blood coming out of the hole with a cotton swab, wash with sterile saline and then dry thoroughly.\nGlue the implanted cannula to the skull using gel glue. Wait until dry.\nApply dental cement along the implanted cannula to attach it to the skull. Leave 2 mm (0.079'') extend from its upper end to enable dummy insertion. Wait until dry.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Do not put cement on the cannula-holder.\nLift the cannula-holder, leaving the implanted cannula in place.\nInsert the dummy into the implanted cannula.\nImplant all other devices such as recording arrays, optic fibers, stimulation electrodes etc. Apply dental cement over the rest of the skull, covering all the implants.\nInject 3 mL of room temperature Ringer’s solution and carprofen 5 mg/kg SC21.",
    "Monitor the rat until it regains consciousness (animal is upright, has control of its airway and is not in danger of aspiration). Return the rat to its home cage for full recovery.\nMicroinjections\n\tNOTE: During the injection, it is crucial to verify that the flow of the bicuculline is intact. This can be done by letting a small air bubble form in the injector and monitoring its movement. The remaining volume of the injector may be filled with saline, so that no bicuculline is wasted.\n\t\nAttach the injector to a bicuculline syringe with a 25 G needle (OD 0.018''). Fill ~1/3-1/2 of the injector and remove the syringe, allowing for the formation of a small air bubble.\nAttach the injector to a sterile saline-filled syringe with a 25 G needle (OD 0.018''). Fill the injector until the bicuculline reaches the end and a small drop comes out of it.\nRemove the plunger of a 10 µL precision glass microsyringe.\nCut and attach a short-flexible polymer tube (~3 cm, 1.181'') to the precision glass microsyringe.\nConnect the other end of the short-flexible tube to a 1 mL syringe, 25 G needle (OD 0.018'') filled with sterile water.\nInject water through the short-flexible tube into the precision glass microsyringe until water comes out of it. Disconnect the short-flexible tube.\nReinsert the plunger until it reaches the ~7 µL mark on the precision glass microsyringe.\nInsert the precision glass microsyringe into the destined slot in the infusion pump machine.\nAttach the injector to the precision glass microsyringe and configure the settings to a rate of 0.35 µL/min and a total volume of 0.35 µL.",
    "Put a paper wipe under the injector tip. Mark the air bubble location on the injector, start the infusion pump machine and verify that a bicuculline drop appears. After the injection, mark the air bubble location again.\n\t\tNOTE: The difference between the two marks corresponds to the desired difference during the experimental injection.\nPut the rat in the experimental cage and remove the dummy.\nInsert the injector into the implanted cannula through the end (see Figure 3A).\nStart the infusion pump machine. Verify that the air bubble is moving. Start the stopwatch to keep track of tic initiation and termination times.\nOne minute following the injection, remove the injector and slowly reinsert the dummy.\n\t\tNOTE: Inserting the dummy after the injection pushes the bicuculline into the injection target.\nPost injection\nDisconnect the injector from the precision glass microsyringe.\nWash out the remaining solution from the injector, using an air-filled syringe. Clean the injector with sterile water and then drain it by injecting air through the injector.\nDisconnect the precision glass microsyringe from the infusion pump machine and clean it with sterile water.\n2. Chronic model\nPre-surgery preparation\nCannula-guide preparation\n\t\tNOTE: The cannula-guide is part of the infusion-tube and is used to attach the infusion-cannula to the cannula-holder during the implantation.\n\t\t\nCut 12 mm (0.472'') of stainless steel, 25 G (OD 0.02'', ID 0.015'') hypo-tube to obtain a cannula-guide (Figure 2, device #1). Use a rotary tool to achieve straight edges.\nPrepare a cannula-holder as described in step 1.1.4. Insert the cannula-holder into the cannula-guide to verify it is properly attached and remove it.\nInfusion-cannula preparation\n\t\tNOTE: The infusion-cannula is also a part of the infusion tube. It is implanted into the final target of the striatum and allows focal infusion of bicuculline.",
    "Cut stainless steel, 30 G (OD 0.012'', ID 0.007'') hypo-tube to obtain an infusion-cannula. Use a rotary tool to achieve straight edges. The total infusion-cannula length is the sum of the desired implantation depth plus a safety factor (~1-2 mm, 0.039''-0.079''), the infusion-cannula bent part (2 mm, 0.079''), the overlap with the cannula-guide (3 mm, 0.118''), and the horizontal part (4 mm, 0.157'') (Figure 2, device #2).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Unlike the acute model, the implantation depth is equal to the final infusion target.\nInsert a 0.005'' diameter wire into the infusion-cannula and bend them into an L shape in the intended location. The vertical part corresponds to the desired implantation depth plus 4-5 mm (0.157''-0.197''), and the horizontal part is 4 mm (0.157'') long.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The insertion of the inner wire prevents obstruction of the cannula during bending.\nFlexible catheter-tubing preparation\n\t\tNOTE: It is also a component of the infusion-tube. It connects the infusion-cannula to the mini-osmotic pump via a tubing-adapter.\n\t\t\nCut 8 cm (3.149'') of polyethylene (PE)-10 tubing (ID 0.011'', OD 0.025'') (Figure 2, device #3).\n\t\t\tNOTE: The length of the catheter is determined by the distance between the implantation target and pump location, allowing free movement of the rat’s head and neck (see Figure 3B).\nAssembly of the infusion-tube\n\t\tNOTE: The infusion-tube conducts the bicuculline from the mini-osmotic pump to the brain. It consists of the cannula-guide, the infusion-cannula, the flexible catheter-tubing, the tubing-adapter and the flow-moderator (Figure 2).\n\t\t\nRemove the inner wire from the infusion-cannula. Inspect the cannula under the microscope to make sure its edges are open and clean on both sides; if not, use a 30 G (OD 0.01'') needle to open it.",
    "Glue the cannula-guide to the vertical section of the infusion-cannula, near the bent part, on the 3 mm (0.118'') overlap, using CA glue and CA accelerator.\nInsert the horizontal part of the infusion-cannula into the flexible catheter-tubing. The overlap should be at least 2 mm (0.079'').\nEject the translucent cap of the pump flow-moderator. This will reveal the short stainless steel cannula tube (Figure 2, device #5.1).\n\t\t\tNOTE: The flow-moderator is a part of the mini-osmotic pump kit. It is composed of a translucent cap, a short cannula-part, a white flange and a long cannula-part. The long cannula-part is inserted into the mini-osmotic pump and the short cannula-part is connected to the catheter-tubing via tubing-adapter.\nImmerse the tubing-adapter (Figure 2, device #4) in 70% alcohol. Wait several minutes to allow the material to swell.\nAttach the tubing-adapter to the short cannula-part of the flow-moderator, until it touches the white flange (Figure 2, device #5.2). The tubing-adapter will shrink in the air to form a tight sealed connection.\nInsert the flexible catheter-tubing into the open end of the tubing-adapter, until it touches the short cannula-part of the flow-moderator.\nHold the long cannula-part (Figure 2, device #5.3) using a clip stand and glue all the connections. The connections are between the tubing-adapter and white flange, the tubing-adapter and the flexible catheter-tubing, and finally the flexible catheter-tubing and the horizontal part of the infusion-cannula. Wait several hours until the glue is completely dry (depending on the glue type).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Use PE compatible adhesive to prevent the connections from coming loose.\nInject sterile water through the long cannula-part of the infusion tube, using a syringe with a 27 G (0.014'') blunt needle. Verify that the water flows smoothly through the infusion-cannula. Inject air through the infusion-tube to drain the water.",
    "Priming of the mini-osmotic pump\n\t\tNOTE: The priming is a start-up procedure that enables the pump to start the infusion immediately after the implantation.\n\t\t\nFill a heating bath with water at body temperature (~37 °C). Fill a small beaker with sterile saline and place it in the heating bath.\nWrap the mini osmotic pump with a paper wipe, and fix it vertically with the opening facing upwards, using a clip holder stand.\nFill the pump with ACSF using a syringe with a 27 G (0.014'') blunt needle. While removing the syringe, continue to inject the ACSF to prevent air from entering. An ACSF bubble will appear in the aperture of the pump.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The initial ACSF infusion enables the rat to fully recover from surgery before tics are induced. Optionally, the bicuculline-filled pump can be implanted during the primary surgery to avoid the following pump replacement, but it is not optimal19.\nAttach a syringe, 27 G (0.014'') blunt needle to the long cannula-part of the infusion-tube and inject ACSF through it. While removing the syringe, continue to inject the ACSF, to prevent air from entering. An ACSF bubble will appear in the long cannula-part.\nInsert the long cannula-part into the pump, bubble to bubble. An ACSF bubble should appear at the tip of the infusion-cannula.\nPlace the pump in the beaker. Prime the pump, attached to the infusion-tube, for at least 4-6 hours (at ~37 °C) preceding pump implantation. Make sure only the pump contacts the saline.\nPump implantation surgery\n\t\t\nAnaesthetize the rat according to the anesthesia protocol. See step 1.2.1.\nShave the rat's head and back, using an electric clipper, slightly posterior to the scapulae.\nPerform the basic steps in surgery, as described in steps 1.2.3-1.2.11. The incision should be along the scalp up to the occipital bone.",
    "Sterilize a large hemostat (~14 cm long, 5.512'') in autoclave. Insert the hemostat through the incision and create a subcutaneous pocket in the rat’s back by alternately opening and closing it under the skin through the midscapular line.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The pocket should be large enough to contain the pump and allow it to move slightly.\nMini-osmotic pump and infusion tube implantation\n\t\t\nAttach the cannula-holder to the stereotaxic arm and place it in the desired position for implantation.\nRemove the pump from the heating bath and place it on the rat's back covered with a paper wipe.\nSlide the cannula-guide of the infusion-tube on the cannula-holder.\nHold the pump with a hemostat and gently insert it into the subcutaneous pocket.\nImplant the anchor screws.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Implant the anchor screws after inserting the pump, to avoid blockage of the pocket opening, and before cannula implantation to avoid cannula displacement.\nImplant the infusion-cannula in the target and glue it to the skull using gel glue. Wait until dry. The coordinates for forelimb tic induction are: AP: +1 to +1.5, mL: ±2.5, DV: 5.\nApply dental cement along the infusion-cannula to fix it to the skull. Wait until dry.\nLift the cannula-holder leaving the implanted cannula in place.\nImplant all other devices. Apply dental cement on the rest of the skull, covering all the implants. Leave enough flexible catheter-tubing in the subcutaneous pocket unfixed to enable free movement of the rat.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Make sure there are no exposed areas between the skull and the pocket opening, and that the catheter is not bent.\nFinalize the surgery as detailed in steps 1.2.12.10-1.2.12.11.\nPump replacement surgery\n\tNOTE: Each mini-osmotic pump type has its own predetermined delivery infusion period. Hence, the pump replacement surgery should be performed prior to the expiration date.\n\t\nPre-surgery preparation\n\t\t\nRepeat steps 2.1.5.1-2.1.5.2.",
    "Fill the pump with bicuculline using a syringe with a 27 G (0.014'') blunt needle. While removing the syringe, continue to inject bicuculline, to prevent air from entering.\nInsert the flow-moderator (attached to its translucent cap) inside the pump.\nPlace the pump in the beaker. Prime the pump for at least 4-6 hours (at ~37 °C) preceding pump replacement.\nSurgery\n\t\t\nAnesthetize the rat (see step 1.2.1.1) and shave its back using an electric clipper.\nSwab the rat's back with povidone iodine and then with an alcohol wipe to sterilize the area. Infiltrate along the desired incision line with a 0.5-1% lidocaine solution (SC).\nMake an incision on the skin above the implanted pump. Wash the pocket with room temperature ACSF and dry with gauze pads. Use autoclaved disposable drapes to cover the area near the incision.\nDetach the ACSF-filled pump from the flow-moderator using a hemostat and discard.\nRemove the bicuculline-filled pump from the heating bath. Detach and discard the flow-moderator from the bicuculline-filled pump.\nGently attach the bicuculline-filled pump to the implanted flow-moderator. Avoid touching the surrounding skin. \n\t\t\tNOTE: Steps 2.2.2.4-2.2.2.6 should be performed quickly to prevent air bubbles. However, the pump should be inserted slowly to prevent rapid entry of bicuculline into the brain.\nPress the two margins of the incision closely together, using forceps. Glue the incision line with a tissue adhesive. As an alternative, close the incision using sutures.\nSwab the area with povidone iodine and finalize the surgery as detailed in steps 1.2.12.10-1.2.12.11.\nSubscription Required.
