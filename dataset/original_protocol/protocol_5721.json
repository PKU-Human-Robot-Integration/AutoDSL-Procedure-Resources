    "Lentiviral plasmid transfection and virus productionPrepare tissue culture plates by coating them with 2% gelatin (see Recipes). Briefly rinse each 10-cm plate with 10 ml of the 2% gelatin solution and let dry in a hood. Note: The same 10 ml of gelatin solution can be reused to coat several plates.Plate 293T cells on the gelatin-coated tissue culture plates 24 h before transfection at 6-7.5 x 106 cells per 10 cm plate in 10 ml D10 growth media (see Recipes). Note: We prepare 4 plates for each lentivirus preparation.Transfect 293T cells with lentivirus (e.g., pFULGW) and packaging plasmids (pCMV-ΔR8.91, pCMV-VSVG). Notes:  Lentiviruses are classified as Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) organisms due to their ability to infect primary human cells and experiments need to be conducted in appropriate facilities. Transfection efficiency can be checked by imaging GFP expression using an inverted fluorescent microscope. For each plate, prepare 60 μl of Lipofectamine in 1.5 ml Opti-MEM. For each plate, also prepare 13.3 μg FULGW, 10 μg pCMV-ΔR8.91, and 6.7 μg pCMV-VSVG in 1.5 ml Opti-MEM. Mix the Lipofectamine and plasmid containing Opti-MEM together and incubate for 25 min at room temperature.Remove 2 ml of media from each plate (now 8 ml total).Add 3 ml of the Lipofectamine/plasmid mix to each plate in a dropwise manner, evenly distributing the mix over the plate.Incubate for 6 h at 37 °C, aspirate the media and add 10 ml of fresh D10.Harvest SN (the culture media) at 48 h and store at 4 °C. Add another 10 ml fresh D10 media and harvest again at 72 h following transfection. Combine the SNs and clear by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm (805 x g) for 5’ in a table-top centrifuge. Then filter SN through a 0.45 μm filter that has been pre-wetted with 10 ml D10.",
    "Concentrate the virus.Note: Use proper containment when working with lentiviruses as per BSL-2 and institutional guidelines. Ultra-centrifugation methodPut the SN in Beckman ultra-clear 25 x 89 mm tubes (each holds up to 35 ml) and weigh on a balance to the hundredth of a gram to insure they are of equal weight such that the rotor will be balanced.Spin at 25,000 rpm (112,000 x g) for 90 min at 4 °C in an SW-28 rotor.Discard supernatant by inverting the tube. Maintain the tube in the inverted position in the tissue culture hood and aspirate the remaining fluid from the walls of the tube to dry it completely without disturbing the viral pellet.Note: The pellet will be small and can be difficult to visualize.Add 200 μl of serum-free media directly to the viral pellet and allow it to resuspend for 12 h at 4 °C. Gently pipette to improve resuspension.Filtration methodPlace SN in Centricon Plus-70 unit (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Each unit holds approximately 60 ml.Centrifuge at 3,000 rpm (1811 x g) at 15 °C for 2-2.5 h using a table-top centrifuge.Discard flow through.Invert unit and spin at 1,500 rpm (453 x g) at 15 °C for 3 min to collect the viral concentrate.Aliquot 20 μl of virus per Eppendorf tube and store at -80 °C. Note: Aliquoting the virus helps to avoid freeze-thaw cycles, each of which will decrease the MOI by about 50%. Titer lentivirusOne day prior, plate 293T cells in 24-well plates at 250,000 cells/well in 0.5 ml D10. Transfect cells by adding the equivalent of 10, 3, 1, 0.3, 0.1, and 0 μl of viral concentrate per well of each prep.",
    "After 2 days, harvest cells by rinsing with 100 μl of PBS and then adding 100 μl per well of trypsin-EDTA and incubating for 5 min at 37 °C. FACS cells and determine % GFP positive.Calculate:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180417/20180417193559_9781.jpgCell line transductionMix 5-10 MOI of lentivirus in serum-free media with polybrene (6-8 μg/ml) and use it to replace the media of your cell line in a 12- or 24-well tissue culture plate. Spin transfect at 32 °C for 3-4 h at 1,000 x g (~2,300 rpm on a table-top centrifuge). Incubate at 37 °C for another 3 h, then replace the media with fresh culture media.Repeat viral transduction the next day if starting with lower MOI.Grow for 2 days and check transduction efficiency with FACS or with a fluorescent microscope. GFP expression is heterogeneous in cells 2 days following transduction with FULGW and will decrease over time in culture (Figure 2A). Notes:  This decrease likely is due to the competition of untransduced clones or transgene loss where viral integration did not occur. When testing by FACS, add 0.5 μg/ml of propidium iodide to the FACS solution to exclude dead cells. Isolate luciferase expressing clonesPlate transduced cells into round-bottom 96-well plates with the goal of obtaining one positive cell per well. The most efficient method to accomplish this is to FACS sort individual GFP-expressing cells 2-3 days after transduction into wells containing 100 μl of growth media. Alternatively, single-cell clones can be obtained by methods of limiting dilution. For example, by preparing plates with 100 μl of growth media containing ~5 cells/ml. Note: Plate multiple plates to ensure the development of sufficient clones.Allow cell clones to grow for ~2 weeks, giving them another 100 μl of fresh culture media at 1 week.",
    "Observe for clone growth by simply looking for wells with media that is becoming yellow, or by holding the plate up to a light and looking for colonies in the bottom of the wells. Transfer the clones to 24-well plates and expand over a few days.Test for GFP expression by FACS analysis. Clones derived from single cells will have a homogenous, narrow range of GFP expression. Select clones with different levels of expression for further testing (Figure 2B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180417/20180417010103_8206.jpgFigure 2. Assessing tumor cell line transduction by FACS. A. GFP expression in A20 cells 2 days and 2 weeks following transduction with FULGW. B. Isolated A20-Luc/GFP clones (#1, 12 and 20) demonstrate stable and homogenous GFP expression.Test for luciferase activity.Place 10,000 cells in round-bottom 96-well tissue culture plates.To each well add a volume of Bright-GloTM Reagent equal to the volume of culture medium in the well, and mix. For 96-well plates, typically 100 μl of reagent is added to cells in 100 μl of culture medium.Wait at least 2 min to allow cell lysis, then measure luminescence in a luminometer or an IVIS system (Figures 3A and 3B).Select clones and retest for GFP and luciferase expression after two weeks of culture to insure stable integration of the transgenes.Freeze and store multiple aliquots of the cell line in liquid nitrogen for future use.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180417/20180417010229_5933.jpgFigure 3. Confirmation of luciferase expression. A. Imaging A20 and A20-Luc/GFP B-cell lymphoma clones #1, 20, and 12 (10,000 cells from each clone are plated in a round-bottom 96-well plate) and tested for luciferase activity using an IVIS imaging system following the addition of D-Luciferin. B. Luminescence for each clone is quantified in photons per second (p/sec).Image luciferase cell lines in vivo It is important to determine whether cell lines will grow efficiently in vivo. Administer 0.",
    "5-1 x 106 Luc/GFP tumors cells either subcutaneously or intravenously into mice of the same genetic background (e.g., BALB/c for A20 cells).Note: It may be necessary to precondition mice with 4 Gy of total body irradiation 4 h prior to tumor administration to permit tumor growth in some strains. Quantify tumor burden by measuring luciferase activity by IVIS (Figure 4).Inject mice with D-Luciferin (150 mg/kg, i.p.) and anesthetize by exposure to 4% isoflurane in an anesthetic chamber. Once sedated, transfer the mice onto the pre-warmed stage inside the IVIS imaging system specimen chamber with continuous exposure to 2% isoflurane flowing into the nose-cone to sustain sedation.Image mice and measure photon flux approximately 10 min following injection of the substrate.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180417/20180417010520_4059.jpgFigure 4. Monitoring tumor burden in mouse leukemia model. Luminescence imaged by IVIS at 7 and 14 days following, A. subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of 1 x 106 A20-gfp/luc clones on the right flank, or B. after intravenous (i.v.) injection of 5 x 105 A20-gfp/luc clones by tail vein injection.Euthanize mice when primary tumors reach ~1 cm3 (estimate from palpation), if animals lose significant weight (> 20%), develop hind-limb paralysis or become moribund, whichever comes first according to the method approved by your Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). For intravenously injected leukemia models, where tumor burden is difficult to determine by palpation, we typically euthanize animals when their measured luminescence reaches 107 p/sec.As a control, obtain a baseline measurement of luminescence in an untreated mouse following D-Luciferin injection."
