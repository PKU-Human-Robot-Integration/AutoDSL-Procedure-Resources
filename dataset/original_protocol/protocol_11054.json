    "The study was performed according to the guidelines laid down by the German Animal Welfare Act and was approved by the Berlin State Authority (\"Landesamt für Gesundheit und Soziales\", permit number: G0053/15).\nNOTE: The main objective of this protocol was to investigate the effect of repeated anesthesia on glucocorticoid metabolites. A sample size calculation was performed to determine the number of animals to be used: n ≥ 2 × (s/µ1- µ2)2 × (zα + zβ)2. µ1- µ2 is the difference between population means at which power and sample size calculations are made (α = 5%, β = 80%); zα = 1.96 and zβ = 0.84 are the quantiles of the standard normal distribution. Figure 1 illustrates the time line of this protocol. If a parameter of the protocol shows a difference with the control level, the animal should be closely monitored, and the parameter should be measured again after a suitable period. For example, if trait anxiety-related behavior is increased, this behavior should be tested again a week later, in order to help determine the period until full recovery. Time points and periods defined in this protocol can be adapted for use with other procedures. When changing time points, habituation periods should be kept as described in the protocol. In order to reduce factors that might influence the mice's behavior, tests requiring more manipulation should be conducted after tests that do not disturb the normal behavior of mice. Figure 2 summarizes all tests of the protocol using a summary scoring sheet. Figure 3 provides simplified scales of the grade of well-being, which give an overview of how to interpret the test results.\n1. Habituating mice to handling by experimenter",
    "Allow mice to habituate to the animal facility for at least 2 weeks after they have been obtained from another facility or vendor.\nHouse mice in groups and maintain them under standard conditions (room temperature 22 ± 2 °C; relative humidity 55 ± 10%) on a light:dark cycle of 12:12 h.\nProvide all groups with a tunnel and cotton nestlets as standard enrichment, and provide food and water ad libitum.\nHabituate all mice to the tunnel and/or cup handling at least a week prior to testing12.\n\tNOTE: Picking up mice by the tail can induce stress or anxiety, which in turn affects well-being and also has an impact on the results of this protocol12.\n2. Preparing the behavioral testing room and apparatuses\nNOTE: Provide a separate room for testing, ideally near the room where the animals are kept. Transport the mice in their home cages to the testing room at least 60 min before the procedure is conducted. If possible, conduct all tests of this protocol in the same testing room where the procedure is carried out.\nPrepare an observation cage to test burrowing behavior8 and to take the photographs for use in the MGS13 (Figure 4).\n\t\nUse a glass box with a floor area of approximately 220 mm × 290 mm and a height of 390 mm.\nCover the floor of this box with approximately 0.5 cm of bedding material.\nScatter a handful of used bedding material from the home cage on top of the new bedding material to reduce distress caused by the new environment.\nProvide food, the same kind that is normally supplied as diet, and water.\n\t\tNOTE:If possible, use water bottles, because mice may fill water bowls with bedding material .",
    "Prepare a cage (type III: 420 mm × 260 mm × 150 mm) for the 24-h observation period, for which mice are housed individually (Figure 5).\n\tNOTE: In order to minimize the duration of individual housing, collect data for nest building behavior, home cage activity, food intake, and fecal corticosterone metabolites (FCM) during this period.\n\t\nPlace new bedding material in the cage (approximately 0.5 cm deep) and scatter a handful of used bedding material without feces from the home cage on top of the new material, in order to reduce distress.\nProvide a standardized square cotton nestlet of a defined weight, as environmental enrichment only (see table of materials)14.\n\t\tNOTE: Commercial nestlets might differ in weight. Therefore, we modified the weight of the nestlet described by Deacon and used 2.0 g instead of 2.7 g14.\nMount the infrared sensor on the top of the cage, when using an infrared sensor to measure home cage activity (see table of materials).\nProvide food, the same kind that is normally supplied as diet, and water ad libitum.\n3. Mouse Grimace Scale\nNOTE: Photographs for the MGS are taken in the observation cage at three time points: (i) 2 days prior to the procedure to record baseline MGS levels, (ii) 30 min after the procedure, and (iii) 150 min after the procedure. When well-being is impaired, scores on the MGS increase. If increased MGS scores are still observed after 150 min, take additional photographs at a later stage.\nUse a high-definition camera for photography.\nGently transfer the mouse into the observation cage and allow the mouse to habituate to the new environment for at least 30 min.\nContinuously take about 30 - 40 photographs for each time point within 1 - 2 min.",
    "Sort all photographs by selecting the sharp frontal or lateral photographs and discarding blurry photographs or photographs that show mouse faces from other perspectives than frontal or lateral view.\nRandomly select one photograph from each time point, (i.e. 2 days prior to the procedure, 30 min after the procedure, and 150 min after the procedure) for each mouse.\nCrop the photographs to display only the head of the mouse so that the body position is not visible13.\nCreate a spreadsheet file with one sheet for each photograph and add a table including the five facial action units of the MGS to each sheet.\n\tNOTE: The file contains baseline photographs as well as photographs post procedure.\nRandomize the order of the sheets.\nPresent the file on a computer screen to three independent persons, who were previously trained to use the MGS developed by Langford et al. and have them score the facial action units using a 3-point-scale (0 = not present, 1 = moderately present, 2 = obviously present).\n\tNOTE: Scoring is based on following parameters13: Orbital tightening (\"narrowing of the orbital area, with a tightly closed eyelid or an eye squeeze\"); nose bulge (\"rounded extension of skin visible on the bridge of the nose\"); cheek bulge (\"convex appearance of the cheek muscle\"); ear position (\"ears pulled apart and back from their baseline position or featuring vertical ridges that form owing to tips of ears being drawn back\"); whisker change (\"movement of whiskers from their baseline position either backward, against the face or forward, as if standing on end; whiskers may also clump together\").\nAnalyze scores, as follows (adapted from Langford et al.13).\n\t\nAverage all facial action units for each photograph to generate the MGS score.",
    "NOTE: If one of the facial action units could not be scored, average the remaining facial action units.\nSubtract the mean for the baseline photographs from the mean for the photographs post procedure to obtain a MGS difference score for each mouse.\nTest for differences in the MGS difference scores between the persons (nonparametric test for related samples).\n\t\tNOTE: If there is a significant difference (p < 0.05), determine whether scores of all photographs or only scores of a few photographs differ between the persons. If the latter is true, repeat scoring of these photographs. Otherwise, the persons should repeat the MGS training and then score the photographs again.\nAverage the MGS difference scores obtained from the different scorers for each mouse, if results of all persons do not significantly differ.\nUse a nonparametric statistical test to compare the MGS difference scores averaged between the study groups.\n4. Burrowing behavior8,15,16\nPrepare burrows by placing 140 ± 2 g food pellets normally supplied as diet in a standard opaque plastic water bottle (250 mL, 150 mm length, 55 mm diameter, 45 mm diameter of bottle neck)8.\n\tNOTE: As mice prefer wide tubes, burrows with a diameter of 68 mm can be used as described by Deacon16.\nPlace the burrow filled with food pellets in the home cage 5 days prior to the procedure for acclimatization.\n\tNOTE: The regular food-dispensing unit in the cage should not be emptied but should also remain filled with food pellets, as mice are used to this.\nCarry out the test twice, 2 days prior to the procedure (baseline); carry out the last 30 min post procedure as well.\n\t\nLet the mouse habituate for at least 30 min to the observation cage where photographs for the MGS were taken.",
    "Place the plastic water bottle filled with food pellets parallel to the back wall of the observation cage.\nWeigh food pellets (g) remaining in the burrow after 2 h.\nCalculate the weight of food pellets removed from the burrow by mice relative to initial weight (%).\n5. 24-h observation period\nNOTE: Mice are housed individually, as described in 2.2. (Figure 5), for a period of 24 h, in order to measure food intake, home cage activity, nest building behavior, and FCM levels. The 24-h observation takes place twice: (i) 2 days prior to the procedure for baseline levels, (ii) on the day of the procedure.\nFood intake\nWeigh the mice at regular intervals (e.g. 2 days before anesthesia, immediately before anesthesia, 2 days after anesthesia and weekly after anesthesia), in order to evaluate any changes in body weight (part of the score sheet).\n\t\tNOTE: Body weight is required to calculate food intake per gram of body weight. Water intake can also be measured during the 24-h observation period. If food intake is reduced, well-being may be impaired.\nDetermine the initial weight of standard food diet (grams) provided in the food unit of the cage (approximately 100 g).\nDetermine the weight of standard food diet at the end of the 24-h observation period.\nScan the cage side beneath the food unit carefully for food spillage and add any extra food pellets found to the weight of food pellets remaining in the food unit.\nCalculate food intake per unit body weight.\nHome cage activity\n\tNOTE: The following instructions refer to the use of an infrared sensor (see table of materials), but home cage activity can also be assessed with alternative programs. Deviation of home cage activity from control levels (e.g. hypoactivity, hyperactivity) may be a sign of impaired well-being.\n\t\nStart the program.",
    "Choose a sample interval of 1 min and an acquisition time of 24 h, meaning that impulses are recorded every minute for 24 h.\n\t\tNOTE: If the experimenter enters the room several times after recording started, only use data from periods, when mice were not disturbed (i.e. during the dark period).\nSum up 10-min intervals of impulses.\nCalculate the area under the time curve (impulses × min).\nNest building behavior\n\tNOTE: Complex and high nests can serve as an indicator of well-being.\n\t\nPlace a square cotton nestlet (see Table of Materials) with a defined weight (e.g. 2.0 g) in the middle of the cage.\nScore the nest on a 5-point scale (see below) according to Deacon14 the following morning, approximately 2 h after the light turns on. Weigh any untorn nestlet pieces that are at least 5% of the initial nestlet weight. Score the nests as follows14\nAssign score of \"1\" if 90% of the nestlet intact.\nAssign score of \"2\" if it is 50 - 90% intact.\nAssign score \"3\" if 50 - 90% of the nestlet is shredded.\nAssign score \"4\" if more than 90% is shredded but nest is flat, and less than 50% of its circumference is higher than mouse body height when curled up.\nAssign score \"5\" if more than 90% nestlet is shredded and nest is high, and more than 50% of its circumference is higher than body height of a curled up mouse.\nFecal Corticosterone Metabolites\n\tNOTE: Increases of FCM above the control level reflect acute stress levels over the 24-h postanesthetic period.\n\t\nCollect all dry fecal pellets from the cage by using forceps at the end of the 24-h observation period and eliminate wet pellets contaminated with urine.\nExtract FCM according to Palme et al.17, as follows.",
    "Dry fecal samples at a temperature of 60 - 70 °C.\nHomogenize fecal samples using a mortar.\nShake an aliquot of 0.05 g with 1 mL of 80% methanol in a centrifuge tube for 30 min on a multi-vortex.\nCentrifuge samples at 2500 x g for 15 min.\nPipette 0.5 mL of supernatant into another centrifuge tube.\nStore fecal samples (and extracts) at a minimum of -18 °C.\nAnalyze FCM using a 5α-pregnane-3b,11b,21-triol-20-one enzyme immunoassay (EIA)18,19 or another fully validated EIA.\nCalculate the percentage change of FCM concentrations relative to the baseline FCM concentrations.\n6. Free exploratory paradigm\nTake the home cage out of the rack and place it on a table surface at the end of the 24-h observation period.\nPlace a gridded cage top (without food or water bottles) in the cage at an angle of 45° to the longer side of the cage.\n\tNOTE: Do not destroy the nest, which serves as a hiding place for the mouse, but place the cage top diagonally above the nest.\nMonitor or video-record the mice for 10 min from a distance of approximately 1.5 m.\n\t\nStart the timer.\nNote all times when the mouse climbs onto the cage top (with all four paws on the cage top) or leaves the cage top (with one or more paws on the cage floor).\n\t\tNOTE: Some mice may climb up the cage top and leave it in order to walk along the edge of the cage. Some mice also rear on the cage top. Treat these cases as if the mice were still on the cage top.\nEvaluate parameters following Bert et al.20.\n\t\nAnalyze latency to first exploration (in seconds).\nAnalyze number of explorations.\nAnalyze total duration (seconds) of exploration.",
    "NOTE: A high latency to first exploration, a low number of explorations, and a low total duration of exploration can indicate higher trait anxiety levels.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
