    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nBiolistic transformation of the yeast cells\nTiming: 8–10 days\nIn this step, a yeast strain lacking mitochondrial DNA (MOY160) is transformed with two plasmids pRS315 and pPT24-mtnLuc for nuclear and mitochondrial transformation. The plasmids transformed into mitochondria are replicated and maintained (Fox et al., 1988[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Detailed instructions on how to use the biolistic particle delivery system can be found in the manufacturer’s manual (https://www.bio-rad.com/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/M1652249.pdf[href=https://www.bio-rad.com/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/M1652249.pdf]).\nPrepare yeast cells for biolistic transformation.\nGrow the yeast cells (MOY160) for around 15 h in YP+2% raffinose (YPR) at 30°C, 170 rpm.\nThe following day dilute the culture to 0.05 OD600 in 30 mL of YPR and grow for 2 days at 30°C, 170 rpm. Cells should be in stationary phase. OD600 is expected to be around 3–4, depending on the incubation time.\nHarvest the cells by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 5 min.\nResuspend the pellet in 0.6 mL YP+2% dextrose (YPD) and plate very evenly 100 μL on seven biolistic transformation plates using sterile glass beads.\nLet the plates dry for 2–4 h at 30°C.\nCritical: If the plates are too wet, the vacuum in step 3 cannot build up.\nPrecipitation of DNA on tungsten particles (on ice).\nTo a 1.5 mL tube add:\n10–15 μg of plasmid pPT24-mtnLuc and 5 μg of the marker plasmid pRS315 (less than 15 μL in total),\n100 μL tungsten particles,\n40 μL 0.1 M spermidine.\n100 μL 2.5 M CaCl2.\nIncubate on ice for 10 min, vortex every 2 min.\nSpin 30 s at 13,000 × g, discard supernatant and resuspend particles in 200 μL 100% ethanol (ice-cold).\nSpin as previously, discard supernatant and resuspend particles in 200 μL 100% ethanol (ice-cold).\nSpin as previously, discard supernatant and resuspend particles in 60 μL 100% ethanol (ice-cold).",
    "Note: The tungsten particles need to be thoroughly resuspended before distributing them on the macrocarriers. We recommend vortexing the tube or triturating particles against the wall of the tube with a pipette tip.\nCritical: It is important to work as sterile as possible. All the metal equipment (macrocarrier holders, tweezers) should be autoclaved/decontaminated.\nInsert six macrocarriers into macrocarrier holders with tweezers.\nEqually distribute the DNA-coated tungsten particles on the macrocarriers.\nLet particles dry for a short time (around 10–15 min).\nPreparation of the biolistic chamber and bombardment (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nNote: The first bombardment should be performed without the target cells or tungsten particles.\nThe biolistic chamber needs to be cleaned with ethanol and dried before use.\nPlace the rupture disk into the recess of the retaining cap and mount it onto the end of the gas acceleration tube inside the biolistic chamber.\nPlace the macrocarrier with the particles facing downwards into the macrocarrier launch assembly and secure with the cap.\nInsert the macrocarrier launch assembly into the chamber and adjust the distance by screwing in or out the assembly so the distance between the macrocarrier and the retaining cap is around 0.5 cm.\nPlace the plate with yeast cells in the chamber on the target plate shelf and close the doors.\nNote: The distance between the macrocarrier launch assembly and the target plate shelf can be varied according to the results. In our experience shelves 2 or 3 from the top give the best results.\nStart vacuum by pressing VAC and wait until it reaches 28.5–29 inches of mercury.\nSwitch the button from VAC to HOLD.\nPress FIRE and keep until the rupture disk bursts (around 1,100 psi) and helium pressure gauge drops to 0.\nSwitch the button from HOLD to VENT.",
    "Recover the plate and remove the leftovers of the macrocarrier with sterile tweezers.\nRepeat the steps b–j with the remaining plates and macrocarriers.\nIncubate the cells for 5–7 days at 30°C.\nPause point: The plates can be stored at 4°C for up to two weeks (optional).\nCritical: The abovementioned levels of vacuum and pressure at which the rupture disk bursts are critical for successful transformation and might require testing for each setup.\nScreening for positive transformants\nTiming: 9 days\nThe screening requires two steps. First, MOY160 cells that underwent the transformation with pRS315 plasmid are scored for growth on media lacking leucine. Secondly, the positive colonies are used for mating with another strain (MOY457) that has a disruption in the COX2 gene making this strain respiratory deficient. The original sequence can be reintroduced from the pPT24-mtnLuc plasmid present in mitochondria of the transformed MOY160 strain colonies (here MOY160 pPT24-mtnLuc). This plasmid carries the full wild type COX2 sequence. After mating and homologous recombination in mitochondria, the mtDNA regains the functional COX2 sequence and the resulting strain is able to respire as scored by growth on plates containing glycerol (YP+ 2% glycerol, YPG).\nRestreak at least 1,000 colonies from the biolistic plates to SD-Leu plates (approximately 100 colonies per plate). Incubate for 3 days at 30°C. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nTransfer the colonies by replica plating onto masterplates (YPD plates) and incubate for 1 day at 30°C.\nNote: Masterplates are prepared as a back-up of the colonies picked up on the SD-Leu plates.\nThe same day start a culture of MOY457 in 50 mL of YPD and grow for around 15 h at 30°C, 170 rpm.",
    "The next day expected OD600 of the cells is around 5–6. Harvest all the cells (4,000 × g, 5 min) and plate them using glass beads on the appropriate number of YPD plates. Dry for 2–3 h in 30°C.\nTransfer the colonies from the masterplates onto the YPD plates with the MOY457 cells using a replica plating device of choice.\nIncubate the cells for 2 days in 30°C.\nReplica plate the cells on YPG plates (requiring respiration) and incubate the cells for another 3 days. The respiration-competent colonies have obtained the pPT24-mtnLuc plasmid into the mitochondria and could restore COX2 by homologous recombination between the plasmid and the mtDNA of MOY457. Positive colonies at this step are diploids.\nFor the next steps use the confirmed positive transformants from the SD-Leu plates, that are haploid (MOY160 positive haploid transformant). Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nCritical: Carefully mark the masterplates and SD-Leu plates as well as replica plates to be able to find the corresponding positive transformants on them. These initial positive transformants from SD-Leu plates will be needed for the next steps (MOY160 positive haploid transformant).\nInduced recombination of mitochondrial DNA in a haploid strain via cytoduction\nTiming: 5 days",
    "These steps are required to obtain a haploid strain with the mitochondrial DNA containing the reporter construct. Here, the mitochondria are transferred into another strain by a process called cytoduction. This process depends on delayed karyogamy, which occurs in strains carrying the kar1-1 allele (Lancashire and Mattoon, 1979[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). During the cytoduction, exchange of cytoplasmic organelles occurs regularly, in our hands this process starts around 3 h 30 min after the two strains were mixed. On the other hand, nuclear genomes’ recombination is delayed by around 30 min. This timeframe between 3 h 30 min and 4 h allows for stopping the cytoduction, when the mitochondrial transfer occurred, but the original nuclear genomes are maintained. Homologous recombination of the mitochondrial rho+ genome of MOY457 strain and the plasmid of MOY160 pPT24-mtnLuc restores the COX2 locus. The resulting strain is then a haploid that can be used to deliver the fully functional mitochondrial genome into a recipient strain of choice.\nStart cultures of both the obtained MOY160 positive haploid transformant (carrying mitochondrial pPT24-mtnLuc) and MOY456 in 5 mL of YPD and grow for around 15 h at 30°C, 170 rpm.\nThe next day harvest (4,000 × g, 5 min) equivalent of OD600 2 of both strains into a single tube.\nResuspend the cells in 100 μL of YPD and plate as a single drop on YPD plate.\nIncubate the cells in an incubator at 30°C.\nTransfer around a half of cells using a pipette tip or an inoculation loop to flasks with 10 mL YPD after around 3 h 45 min. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nNote: The incubation time may vary. For more information see problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7] and possible solutions.\nIncubate the cells in 30°C in a shaker (170 rpm) for 2–4 h.",
    "Plate 50 μL of 20× diluted cell culture on YPG plates to get single colonies. Incubate in 30°C for 3 days.\nNote: The dilution factor in this step may vary depending on the strain’s growth speed and the number of cells taken in step 16. One can try different dilutions to obtain the right number of single colonies per plate.\nScreening for positive cytoductants\nTiming: 4 days\nPick around 50 colonies from YPG plates with 3 h 45 min incubation time on YPD plates (masterplates) and incubate for 1 day at 30°C.\nNote: The colonies that could grow on respiratory medium plates (YPG) have restored the full mtDNA with mtnLuc, however they can be haploids or diploids.\nThe next day transfer the colonies using replica plating on SD plates lacking uracil (SD-Ura) and incubate the cells for 3 days in 30°C. This will allow to exclude haploid MOY456 cells.\nThe colonies that could grow on respiratory medium plates (YPG) and on SD-Ura can be the MOY160 mtDNA-mtnLuc haploid strains or diploid strains. To confirm the ploidy of the colonies one can use PCR approach to detect the mating types (Huxley et al., 1990[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) or mate colonies with a strain with mating type A and a different selection marker.\nNote: MOY160 (carrying mtDNA-mtnLuc and a nuclear kar1-1 mutation) can now be used in another round of cytoduction with a desired genomic background strain. This acceptor strain must be rho0 and mating type A.",
    "Note: If the final desired strain has a mating type α, it cannot undergo the cytoduction with MOY160 mtDNA-mtnLuc. In this case, other genetic manipulations are required, i.e mating of MOY160-pPT24-mtnLuc × MOY457 and tetrad dissection to obtain a spore with the correct mating type and kar1-1 mutation. The spores obtained in this dissection can be used for another round of cytoduction to transfer the modified mitochondrial DNA to other strains of choice with different genetic backgrounds, i.e., W303 or BY4742."
