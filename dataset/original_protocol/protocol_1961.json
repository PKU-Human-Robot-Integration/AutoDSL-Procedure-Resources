The protocol optimizes virus spin infection of human colonic organoids. For the experiment outline below, the scale is for a 12-well plate.\nBefore you begin:\nPre-cool centrifuge to 4°C.\nPre-coat plasticware with sterile 0.1% BSA. Add sufficient 0.1% BSA to coat 1.5 mL, 5 mL, 15 mL, and 50 mL tubes at RT for 20 min. Remove BSA solution completely before use. Prepare a 15 mL tube with 5 mL of 0.1% BSA to be used for coating pipettes by pipetting up and down twice before using.\nPre-warm a plate centrifuge to 37°C. Performing spin infection at lower temperatures may reduce transduction rate.\nOrganoid TrypLE enzyme fragment preparation.\nHuman colonic organoids grown for 5–7 days after passage are ready for virus infection, as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A. We typically plate 25–50 organoids per 10 μL Matrigel and passage the organoids at a 1:5 ratio.\nCompletely remove the culture medium and add 1 mL of cold cell recovery solution per well of a 12-well plate. Cell recovery solution should be kept at 4°C.\nIncubate the plate on ice for 30 min to dissolve the Matrigel. Use a BSA-coated 1 mL pipette to transfer 2 wells worth of organoids to a 15 mL BSA-coated tube. Centrifuge the tube at 4°C 300 × g for 3 min.",
    "Note: A clear cell pellet without residual Matrigel should be observed. If there is still Matrigel, discard the supernatant, add 1 mL of fresh cold cell recovery solution and mix, incubate for 10 min at 4°C, then centrifuge at 4°C 300 × g for 3 min. Repeat the incubation and centrifugation if any Matrigel is still present until a clearly defined cell pellet is observable.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 0.3 mL TrypLE with 10 μM Y-27632 by tapping the bottom of tube. Incubate at 37°C in a tissue incubator for 3 min.\nPipette the organoids up and down vigorously, at least 10 times, using a BSA-coated TipOne RPT 1,000 μL XL graduated pipette. Be careful to avoid introducing bubbles. After the pipetting, the organoids should be broken into small fragments as shown in the upper part of Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B.\nInactivate the enzyme digestion by adding 10 mL of 18°C–25°C 10% FBS in advanced DMEM/F12 medium.\nPass the solution through a 70 μm filter into a 50 mL BSA-coated tube. Single cells and small fragments of organoids (<70 μm) should now be present in the medium as shown in the lower part of Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B.\nRemove10 μL of the cell suspension and dilute it with 10 μL of trypan blue solution.\nCalculate the living cell numbers as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C per volume.\nAdd approximately 2 × 105 cells per 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and centrifuge at 4°C 300 × g for 10 min.\nVirus infection. Prepare 10% Pure Bright® bleach solution for the disposal of plasticware that comes into contact with viral particles and media from this step onward.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1559-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Fragments are re-embedded in Matrigel in a 12-well plate as shown in the lower panel.\n(I) Image of nascent organoids in Matrigel one day after embedding.\n(J and K) Organoids after differentiation in HDM for 5 days and ready for assays.\nPrepare a mixture of virus and polybrene in a non-tissue culture coated 24-well plate. Add 20 μL of Lenti-virus with approximately 1 × 108 viral particles and 2 μL of 1 mg/mL polybrene per well of a 24 well dish.\nDiscard the supernatant from step 2h and resuspend the pellet in 180 μL of HCM medium. Add the suspension into one well containing virus and polybrene.\nCentrifuge the 24-well plate at 37°C 1,000 × g for 30 min.\nCells are located at the bottom of the plate as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D. Carefully take out the plate without disturbing the cells and gently add 300 μL of prewarmed HCM to make a total volume of 500 μL.\nIncubate at 37°C in a tissue incubator for 4 h.\nUse a BSA-coated 1 mL pipette to transfer the cells into a 1.5 mL BSA-coated tube. Centrifuge at 4°C 300 × g for 5 min.",
    "Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 400 μL embedding material. Mix well and place 10–15 μL per droplet into one well of a 6-well plate, up to 35–40 droplets total per well (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nPlace the plate in a 37°C tissue incubator for 10 s.\nInvert the plate and incubate at 37°C in the tissue incubator for another 10 min.\nAdd 2 mL of prewarmed HCM per well. Put the plate back into the incubator.\nNote: We use 75% Matrigel for organoid droplets, which does not interfere with droplet formation and reduces cost.\nCritical: Coating tubes and pipettes with 0.1% BSA will significantly reduce organoid loss during the handling steps due to organoid adherence to plastic surfaces.\nPassaging and stocking lentiviral-infected organoids\nTiming: 1 week\nPuromycin selection.\nAfter 3 days of culture as Matrigel drops, as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F, change HCM to media containing 1 μg/mL puromycin.\nCulture for 3 days.\nReplace media with fresh HCM containing freshly added 1 μg/mL puromycin.\nCulture for additional 2 days, as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G.\nStocking and expanding organoids.\nRemove the culture medium completely and add 2.6 mL of cold cell recovery solution per well to the 6-well plate.\nIncubate for 30 min on ice to dissolve Matrigel.\nGently transfer half of the organoids in the cell recovery solution (1.5 mL) using a BSA-coated 1 mL pipette and centrifuge at 4°C 300 × g for 3 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend in 600 μL cell stock solution (10% DMSO + 90% FBS). Freeze 300 μL per cryotube for future expansion and studies.\nPause point: After puromycin selection, the organoids can be frozen until needed for processing the next step.",
    "Pipette the other half of the organoids into small fragments by pipetting up and down vigorously at least 20 times using a BSA-coated TipOne RPT 1,000 μL XL graduated pipette. Be careful to avoid introducing bubbles. Watch under a microscope and pipette until no large pieces of organoids remain. The average size of organoid fragments should be less than 100 μm in diameter.\nCount the number of organoid fragments. Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]H, upper).\nTransfer to a BSA-coated 5 mL tube and centrifuge at 4°C 300 × g for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant. Suspend the pellets in embedding material with ∼20 fragments per one droplet of 10 μL. Add 6 droplets per well to a 12-well plate (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]H, lower).\nOrganoids appear after one day in culture (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]I).\nCulture for additional 3–4 days in HCM with 0.5 μg/mL puromycin.\nNote: In steps 5f and 5h, the organoid fragment number may vary due to puromycin selection and fragmentation. We usually get a total of 250–1,000 fragments.\nTake 500 fragments for example, resuspend in 250 μL embedding material and embed 4 wells in a 12-well plate.\nCritical: Embedding the organoids at low density as indicated ensures even growth.\nCRISPR knockout efficiency validation\nTiming: 2 days\nCollect organoids for western blot.\nContinue from step 5j. Remove the culture medium completely and add 1 mL of cold cell recovery solution to one well of a 12-well plate.\nUsing a BSA-coated 1 mL pipette, gently break up the Matrigel droplets and transfer to a BSA-coated 1.5 mL tube.\nIncubate the tube on ice for 30 min to dissolve Matrigel.\nCentrifuge the tube at 4°C and 300 × g for 3 min.\nDiscard the supernatant. Wash the pellet with 1 mL of cold cell recovery solution on ice for 5 min.",
    "Centrifuge the tube at 4°C and 300 × g for 3 min.\nDiscard the supernatant. Lyse the cell pellets in 100 μL RIPA lysis and extraction buffer with 1 μL protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails at 4°C for 30 min.\nCentrifuge the tube at 4°C and 15,000 × g for 10 min.\nCollect the supernatant from the spin for the BCA protein assay by following the protocol below: https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0011430_Pierce_BCA_Protein_Asy_UG.pdf[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0011430_Pierce_BCA_Protein_Asy_UG.pdf].\nAdjust the total protein concentration of each Ctrl and KO group to 1.25 μg/μL.\nThoroughly mix 20 μL of 4× sample loading buffer with 60 μL of the samples in new 1.5 mL tubes by pipetting. The resulting protein concentration will be 1 μg/μL. Incubate the tubes on a digital heat-block at 95°C for 10 min.\nPrepare sample transfer buffer as specified in the materials section while waiting for the samples to heat. Place the buffer into a 4°C refrigerator for at least one hour, allowing it to cool before using.\nAfter the 10 min incubation on the heat-block, centrifuge the sample tubes at 15,000 × g at 18°C–25°C for 5 min.\nLoad 10 μg (10 μL) per lane per sample and 3 μL of protein ladder in one lane in a precast SDS polyacrylamide gel.\nRun the gel with sample running buffer in a Mini-Protean® Tetra Cell, 2-Gel System, at 180 V with constant voltage for 30–50 min, until the dye reaches the bottom the gel.\nRemove the gel from the cassette and soak the gel in 1 L of 4°C sample transfer buffer.\nCut the PVDF membrane to a similar size as the gel. Assemble the Bio-Rad electroblotting cassette and place the electrodes in the blotting unit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.",
    "Transfer the protein from the gel to the membrane at 200 mA with a constant current in a cold room. Use a magnetic stirrer (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A) to help equally distribute heat and keep the transfer buffers homogeneous. Alternatively, the transfer can be done in a container of ice-water with a magnetic stirrer (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1559-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. CRISPR KO efficiency determination\n(A) An image shows how to use the magnetic stirrer when performing the transfer in a cold room.\n(B) An image shows how to use a container of ice-water for the transfer step.\n(C) Two independent lentiviral infection experiments for human colonic organoid line #89. Western blot analysis for both the CRISPR target protein SATB2 and control β-ACTIN. Membrane was cropped into two parts along the crop line as shown in the picture.\n(D) Detailed steps for calculating the CRISPR KO efficiency using ImageJ software.\nRemove the PVDF membrane from the blotting cassette and mark the orientation of membrane with a pencil. Rinse the membrane with Milli-Q water.\nBlock any non-specific binding of the PVDF membrane with 20 mL of blocking buffer (5% nonfat dried milk in TBST) for 1 h at 18°C–25°C. Shake the membrane with the blocking buffer on the orbital shaker at a low-speed setting.\nIncubate the PVDF membrane with primary antibodies diluted in 3% BSA in TBST at dilutions appropriate for the specific protein and 1:5,000 for Anti-β-ACTIN at 4°C 16–20 h. Shake the membrane incubating in the primary antibodies on the orbital shaker at a low-speed setting.\nRemove the unbound primary antibodies by washing with 20 mL of TBST 3 times for 5 min each on the orbital shaker at a high-speed setting.",
    "Incubate the membrane with secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated antibodies diluted in blocking buffer at a 1:10,000 dilution at 18°C–25°C for 1 h on the orbital shaker at a low-speed setting.\nWash off the unbound secondary antibody with 20 mL of TBST for 5 min at 18°C–25°C on the orbital shaker at a high-speed setting. Repeat this wash 4 additional times.\nCrop the PVDF membrane just below the 72 kDa marker line into two membranes. The higher molecular weight membrane (upper), for example, is for SATB2 detection, and the lower molecular weight membrane (lower) is for β-ACTIN detection (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nPlace both the upper and lower membranes with the protein ladder side up on plastic wrap. For the upper membrane, add 2 mL of enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (Pico from Thermo Fisher) on top of it. For the lower membrane, dilute the substrate with TBST at a 1:5 ratio before adding it on top. Incubate the membranes with substrate for 2 min at 18°C–25°C.\nPut the two membranes back to their original directions and record the signal with a Li-COR C-Digit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nQuantification of CRISPR knockout efficiency.\nUse Image J to measure the intensity of the signal. The results are denoted as “Area.” For each western blot, bands are analyzed following the steps shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B.\nThe western blot image is a gray-scale profile. Open the image using Image J.\nUse the “Rectangle” tool to draw an appropriately sized rectangle around the first lane (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nPress 1 (command plus 1 for mac) to select the rectangle box as the first sample.",
    "Drag the box to the next blot lane and press 2 (command plus 2 for mac). Repeat this step until all samples are marked. Image J will automatically align the rectangles on the same vertical axis as the first sample.\nPress 3 (command plus 3 for mac) to generate a profile plot of each lane.\nTo enclose the peak, use the “Straight” tool to draw a line, forming a closed peak area around each sample. The straight line also can be used as a judgment of background noise. Our results show negligible background.\nUsing the “Wand” tool, click inside the peak and measure the peak “area” for each sample.\nRepeat the measurement two more times, starting over from the initial image. Average the signal intensity of the three measurements.\nDo the same for the β-ACTIN blot.\nNormalize the experimental sample (SATB2 as an example here) signal intensity to β-ACTIN to get relative signal intensity.\nCalculate target CRISPR knockout efficiency using the following formula: CRISPR KO efficiency = (Ctrl relative signal intensity – KO relative signal intensity) / Ctrl relative signal intensity × 100% (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nNote: If you work with a gene that does not have validated antibodies, you can use a DNA mismatch detection assay with T7 endonuclease1. A detailed method is described in (Sentmanat et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nOrganoid differentiation and downstream analysis with immunohistochemistry, RNA and DNA analysis\nTiming: 1 week\nOrganoid differentiation protocol.\nContinue from step 5j. Organoids are differentiated in HDM media (without puromycin, nicotinamide, SB202190, CHIR9902, and EGF, with 25% L-WRN conditioned medium, and addition of FGF2- and IGF-1). The concentrations of each chemical are listed in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section.\nChange differentiation medium every two days.",
    "Differentiate the organoids for 5–6 days (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]J). There will be no obvious morphological changes after differentiation, although one might observe increased branching structures. Our analysis of lineage markers indicate that growing for 5–6 days is sufficient for both absorptive and secretory cells to differentiate.\nDifferentiated organoids are ready for analyses including immunohistochemistry and RNA or DNA analysis (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]K).\nOrganoid preparation for immunohistochemistry.\nRemove culture medium completely and add 1 mL of cold cell recovery solution per one well of a 12-well plate.\nIncubate for 30 min on ice to dissolve Matrigel.\nUsing a BSA-coated 1 mL pipette, gently transfer the differentiated organoids to a BSA-coated 5 mL tube. The 1 mL pipette tip needs to be cut to a ∼4 mm bore width before use.\nCentrifuge at 4°C 100 × g for 3 min.\nDiscard the supernatant. Add 1.4 mL 4% PFA and fix at 4°C for 1 h on a nutator.\nCentrifuge at 4°C 300 × g for 3 min.\nWash twice with DPBS.\nAdd 30% sucrose solution and let sit at 4°C for at least 2 h or 16–20 h.\nCentrifuge down organoids at 4°C 100 × g for 3 min, discard supernatant, leaving ∼50 μL 30% sucrose solution (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1559-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Organoid fixation and embedding for histology and immunohistochemistry\n(A) Organoids fixed in 4% PFA were subsequently treated with 30% sucrose solution.

    "Transfer the organoids in 30% sucrose solution to the top of the O.C.T. compound in the mold (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nMix O.C.T. with organoids and 30% sucrose by swirling with forceps.\nCentrifuge with a swing rotor centrifuge (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C) at 4°C 100 × g for 3 min.\nThe organoids should distribute evenly at the bottom of mold (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D) and are ready for freezing and cryosection.\nRNA extraction.\nRemove culture medium completely and wash with DPBS.\nFor RNA extraction, add 600 μL RLT lysis buffer (Qiagen) with 1% 2-mercaptoethanol directly per one well of a 12-well plate.\nGently shake until Matrigel and organoids are dissolved. This usually takes 3–5 min at 18°C–25°C.\nFollow the manufacturer’s instructions for the RNeasy Mini Kit from Qiagen, the handbook can be downloaded at https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=14e7cf6e-521a-4cf7-8cbc-bf9f6fa33e24&lang=en[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=14e7cf6e-521a-4cf7-8cbc-bf9f6fa33e24&lang=en]\nNote: For one well of a 24-well plate or 48-well plate scale, we use the RNeasy Micro Kit from Qiagen. You need to remove Matrigel with cell recovery solution before adding lysis buffer if the volume of Matrigel exceeds 100 μL (Mini Kit) or 40 μL (Micro Kit). The yield of RNA will decrease dramatically in the presence of excess Matrigel.\nDNA extraction.\nRemove culture medium completely and add 1 mL of cold cell recovery solution per one well of a 12-well plate.\nIncubate for 30 min on ice to dissolve Matrigel.\nUsing a BSA-coated 1 mL pipette, gently transfer the differentiated organoids to a BSA-coated 1.5 mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 4°C 100 × g for 3 min.\nDiscard the supernatant.

    "Critical: The standard differentiation medium (HDM) favors differentiation of the absorptive lineage, i.e., colonocytes, whereas secretory goblet cells are few and appear immature (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).
