    "The male rats were housed in the Animal Care Facility at UMMC, which is approved by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC). Animals had free access to food and water throughout the study. Animals were maintained in a controlled environment with temperature at 24 ± 2 °C, humidity levels of 60–80% and 12 h light/dark cycles. All protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of UMMC.\n1. Preparation of Equipment\nPlace a dual channel differential electrometer amplifier (see the Table of Materials) close to the vessel chamber and at the desired location.\nConnect the output of the amplifier channel A or B to the channel input of the digitizer with a BNC-BNC cable.\nMount the probe in the micromanipulator and place it near the microscope and the myograph. The recording setup must be installed on a vibration-free table.\nPlace the knobs and switches on the front of the amplifier in positions that configure it for this experiment as described in the manual.\nConnect the bath ground to the circuit ground of the amplifier via with an appropriate electrode. Similarly, ensure that the cage is grounded to the chassis of the amplifier.\n2. Preparation of Microelectrodes and Assembly\nUse borosilicate glass microelectrodes (see the Table of Materials) and pull the glass tip to have a 8–10 mm taper, diameter of <1 µm and resistance of 80–120 MΩ when filled with 3 M KCl.\nUse a standard puller to achieve a short gradual taper using the following settings: heat = 650; velocity = 20; pull = 25; time = 250 and loop twice for higher resistances and smaller tips. See the Table of Materials as the settings are instrument-specific.\nNOTE: Tip diameters <1 µm will cause minimal damage to the cell when impaled.",
    "Fill the microelectrode with 3 M KCl using a microfiber syringe (see the Table of Materials).\nSlowly pull the plunger of the microfiber syringe up while injecting the 3 M KCl into the microelectrode to allow space for the fluid to fill and to prevent the formation of air bubbles inside the microelectrode.\nFill the microelectrode until full and ensure that there are no air bubbles before placing it in the microelectrode holder. If bubbles are present, gently tap the microelectrode with a finger to remove the bubbles.\nExercising care, firmly push the electrode shank into the holder through the bored hole. If excess fluid is present, remove it with a tissue.\nConnect the electrode holder assembly to the amplifier probe. Conduct an electrode test, adjust the input offset, verify zero setting and check the probe input leakage as per the amplifier manual.\nMeasure electrode resistance using an electrode test as shown in Table 1.\nNote that a working electrode displays a positive DC voltage shift of 1 mV/MΩ at the channel output. On the other hand, if a large voltage appears at the channel output and on the meter, this indicates a blocked or broken electrode.\nOpen the recording software, assign a name to the file and save it for future analysis in a storing software.\n3. Isolation and Cannulation of the Middle Cerebral Artery\nPreparation the reagents.\nPrepare normal and low calcium physiological salt solution (PSS) as described in Table 2.\nPrepare the myograph.\nRinse the myograph chamber (see the Table of Materials) with distilled water multiple times to keep it free of debris. Load the chamber with 5 mL of normal PSS.",
    "Fill both glass cannulas with filtered normal PSS using a 5–10 mL syringe. Carefully fill the entire cannula and the attached tubing without introducing any air bubbles.\nPrepare two monofilament nylon sutures (10-0, 0.02 mm) with a half-knot each using blunt forceps.\nPlace the partially closed suture knots on both cannulas slightly away from the tip using dissection forceps under a dissection microscope. Later these knots will be slid off and tied carefully onto the cannulated arterial ends to secure the vessel.\nIsolate and cannulate the middle cerebral artery.\nInduce deep anesthesia in a Sprague Dawley rat by using 2–4% inhaled isoflurane.\nDecapitate the rat using guillotine under deep anesthesia.\nCarefully remove the skull using a bone cutter and a scissor.\nRemove the brain from the skull and place it in 5 mL of low calcium PSS on ice.\nIdentify and dissect out an unbranched segment of rat middle cerebral artery (MCA) with an inner diameter of 100–200 μm from the brain using spring scissors and forceps.\nMount the MCA onto the glass cannulas using fine forceps and secure by tightening the sutures in the myograph containing normal PSS.\nClose off the distal cannula so that there will be no flow within the MCAs.\nConnect the inflow pipette to a reservoir holding PSS to allow for control of intraluminal pressure which will be monitored with an in-line pressure transducer.\nVisualize the cannulated MCAs using a charge-coupled device camera (see the Table of Materials) mounted on an inverted microscope and an imaging software.\nSet the axial length of the MCA to an approximate length where it should appear neither rigid nor flaccid.\nEquilibrate the bath solution with O2 (95%) and CO2 (5%) at 37 °C to provide adequate oxygenation, temperature and to maintain pH at 7.4.",
    "Impale (penetrate the cell plasma membrane) the vascular smooth muscle cells.\nConnect the ground electrode and keep it immersed in the PSS of the myograph.\nIlluminate the vessel chamber and look through the microscope to visualize the tip of the microelectrode in the bath solution.\nNOTE: Alternatively, one can visualize the MCA and microelectrode on a computer having an imaging software.\nUse the controls of the micromanipulator to move the tip of the microelectrode close to the outer wall of the blood vessel. The micromanipulator and the tip of the microelectrode must be in a stable position in relation to the tissue.\nNOTE: Before beginning experiments, confirm that the membrane voltage has stabilized. If the measured voltage is unstable, the connection between the electrode and the cell is not sealed, indicating a leak.\nBegin the recording.\nSlowly move the tip of the microelectrode towards the vessel, aiming for the center of the vessel using course or fine control of the micromanipulator.\nNOTE: Occasionally, a small deflection in the recording may be observed when the microelectrode tip contacts a muscle fiber membrane.\nWhen the tip comes in close proximity to the vessel, advance the electrode forward in one rapid motion using the micromanipulator to impale the membrane of the muscle.\nAt this point, one can begin observing the changes in Vm being recorded. Do not touch the micromanipulator when the microelectrode impales the membrane of the cell.\nNOTE: The difference in voltage between the recording and reference electrode decreases from 0 mV to between -40 mV and -75 mV depending on the level of intravascular pressure or other excitatory or inhibitory stimuli. These readings characterize the transmembrane potential difference of the current cell.",
    "Perform multiple impalements on a single vessel in different areas of the vessel without damaging VSMCs in order to get accurate measurements.\nAfter recording, use the manipulator to remove the microelectrode in one rapid movement.\nStop the recording and save data files for further analysis.\nSubscription Required.
