    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCollection of virgin female flies\nTiming: > 2 weeks\nTo obtain flies expressing Aβ42 pan-neuronally (experimental group: elavc155-GAL4/Y; UAS-Aβ42/+) or control flies (elavc155-GAL4/Y), we use the GAL4-UAS transgene expression system with the pan-neuronal elavc155-GAL4 driver (Bloomington stock #458). Because the elavc155-GAL4 transgene is located on the X chromosome, we collect virgin females from elavc155-GAL4 transgenic flies and cross them with male UAS-Aβ42 transgenic flies or parental w1118 flies to maximize the chance of obtaining the genetic targets.\nEstimate required number of experimental (elav-GAL4/Y; UAS-Aβ42/+) and control (elav-GAL4/Y) flies for the experiments (please refer to sections below for details) and write down the cross scheme to obtain a sufficient number of flies with the genetic targets.\nPrepare bottles of elavc155-GAL4 flies for collection of virgin females and bottles of UAS-Aβ42/CyO or w1118 flies for male collection. The number of bottles required depends strictly on the culture conditions in your lab. The culture condition in our lab is all under 24°C–25°C, 40%–50% humidity with 12 h light/dark cycle, if no further specification.\n(Optional) If necessary, transfer parental (F0) flies to new bottles for further virgin female collection.\nAdult flies will eclose around day 10–11. Collect virgin females of elavc155-GAL4 and males of UAS-Aβ42/CyO or w1118 until you obtain a sufficient number of flies for the cross.\n(Optional) Before starting the cross, place 15–20 virgin females or males in plastic vials (25 mm diameter) containing food and maintain the vials in a horizontal position for 4–5 days to make sure that no larva is hatched in the virgin female vials. Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nCritical: When collecting virgin females, please make sure not to select non-virgin females or male flies. If you are not confident, please add step 5 above to minimize a risk.",
    "Set up the cross to obtain Aβ42 flies\nTiming: 4–5 days\nThis section describes the cross used to obtain flies expressing Aβ42 pan-neuronally (experimental group: elavc155-GAL4/Y; UAS-Aβ42/+) or control flies (elavc155-GAL4/Y).\nPlace ⁓30 virgin females of elavc155-GAL4 and ⁓15 males of UAS-Aβ42/CyO (experimental group) or w1118 (control group) into the bottles.\nCulture the bottles.\nAfter 4–5 days, depending on the culture conditions in your lab, discard or transfer the parental (F0) flies to new bottles to increase the number of bottles.\nCollection of Aβ flies\nTiming:  < 10 days since the eclosion starts\nFrom the crosses described above, we usually collect and use males for experiments because they express higher levels of Aβ42 peptides than females due to the dosage compensation of X chromosome. Consequently, adult males exhibit more robust phenotypes.\nTen days after setting up the cross, start to collect F1 males from the experimental group (elavc155-GAL4/Y; UAS-Aβ42/+) or control group (elavc155-GAL4/Y). Anesthetize flies with CO2 gas and carefully sort them against the CyO balancer.\nPlace 25 male flies in plastic vials (25 mm diameter) containing fly food and maintain the vials in a horizontal position. These flies are 0 day old.\nChange the vials every 3–4 days to obtain age-matched flies from the experimental and control groups for each experiment.\nCritical: When collecting flies from the bottle, please make sure to finish F1 fly collection within 10 days to avoid contamination by the subsequent F2 generation. Also, when separating flies under CO2 gas, minimize time and be careful not to physically damage the flies. These factors significantly affect observed phenotypes in flies.\nLongevity assay\nTiming: 2 months (age of flies: starting from eclosion and all through life)",
    "To precisely control the age of flies, collect male flies for the experimental and control groups every day. To obtain consistent results, it is desirable to use 200 flies for each group.\nCollect male flies from the experimental group (elavc155-GAL4/Y; UAS-Aβ42/+) or control group (elavc155-GAL4/Y), and place 25 flies into a plastic vial (25 mm diameter) containing fly food.\nCollect more than 200 flies (25 flies/vial × 8 vials).\nMaintain the vials in a horizontal position and age the flies.\nTap the flies onto the bottom of the food vials and transfer them to fresh food vials every 2 or 3 days. Count the number of dead flies at that time. You do not have to anesthetize flies in this step.\nContinue to score ages and the numbers of dead flies until the end of the experiment.\nAnalyze the survival of Aβ42 flies using the Kaplan–Meier method and compare with the survival of control flies (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/623-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Survival curves of control and Aβ42 flies\nMedian lifespans (Ages, d, days after eclosion; Control; 50 d, Aβ42 flies; 29 d), p < 0.001 by Kaplan–Meier survival analyses with log-rank test (Control; n = 216, Aβ42 flies; n = 154). Experiments were repeated more than three times, and a representative result is shown (Iijima et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). The genotypes of the flies are as follows: (Control): elav-GAL4/Y, (Aβ42): elav-GAL4/Y; UAS-Aβ42/+.\nNote: In general, longevity assays require at least 100 flies, but a larger number (100–200 flies) is preferable because it is more likely to yield consistent results.",
    "Critical: The lifespan of Drosophila is affected by temperature, diet, and many other factors. These environmental factors should be carefully controlled to obtain consistent results. In addition, the lifespan of Drosophila is strongly affected by its genetic background. To avoid any off-target effects, it is important to use a parental line for a transgenic or mutant line as a control to adjust genetic background. If you are not able to obtain an appropriate parental line, it is critical to outcross a transgenic or mutant line of interests to a control line used in your laboratory for 5 generations before starting the experiments. This is true for all of the phenotypic analyses described below.\nForced climbing assay\nTiming: 3–4 weeks (age of flies: 1 week after eclosion)\nAβ42 flies exhibit age-dependent defects in climbing. We usually carry out a forced climbing assay once or twice a week, from 1 week old to 4 weeks old flies.\nDay 1: Collect male flies from the experimental group (elavc155-GAL4/Y; UAS-Aβ42/+) or control group (elavc155-GAL4/Y) and age them.\nCollect 125–150 flies and place 25 flies into a plastic vial (25 mm diameter) containing fly food. Prepare 5–6 vials.\nTap the flies to the bottom of the food vials and transfer them to fresh fly food vials every 2 or 3 days.\nPerform a climbing assay once or twice per week, usually starting at 1 week old.",
    "Day 7: Tap the flies onto the bottom of the food vials and transfer them to new empty plastic vials (25 mm diameter) marked with genotype and scale representing height from the bottom (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). If you plan to reuse the vials, gently wash them with warm water after each assay and dry them well to keep the vials clean. Please be careful not to scratch or damage the inside wall of the vials, which may affect the climbing performance of flies.\nTo acclimate the flies to the environment, lay down the plastic vials containing the flies and leave them as they are for 5 min.\nPerform the 1st trial.\nTap the vials against a foam pad or layered Kimtowels (3–4 vials at once) and knock the flies to the bottom.\nStand the vials in front of a white board. Healthy flies will immediately climb up along the wall of plastic vials (i.e., they will exhibit negative geotaxis).\nAfter 10 sec, take a picture of the flies distributed in the vials (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). We set up the recording time as 10 sec because most control flies can climb to the top of the wall within this period of time. The recording time can be changed depending on your experimental conditions.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/623-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Climbing assay\nVials containing about 25 flies were gently tapped to knock all flies to the bottom. After 10 sec, flies in the top, middle, and bottom thirds of the vial were imaged and counted.\nPlace the vials in a horizontal position and leave them for 3–5 min.\nPerform the 2nd–5th trials.\nRepeat steps 19-a–d.\nAfter the assay, transfer the flies back into the original plastic vials containing fly food and maintain them.",
    "Transfer the flies to new plastic vials containing fresh fly food every 2 or 3 days until the next assay.\nDay 14: Repeat steps 17–22 once or twice per week. The endpoint of the climbing assay is when the Aβ42 flies stop climbing up the wall or when more than 40% of flies (10 in 25 flies) die in the food vial.\nAnalysis\nCount the flies distributed in the top, middle, and bottom parts of the vials using the captured photo (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nCalculate the percentages of flies distributed in each part of the vials and calculate the average of five trials for each vial.\nCalculate the average percentages and standard errors of five or six vials for each genotype or treatment.\nCompare percentages of flies that stayed in the bottom part of the vial among genotypes or treatments and perform statistical analyses using Student’s t-test (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/623-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Climbing assay data\nAβ42 flies exhibit age-dependent climbing deficits. Data show average percentages of flies that climbed to the top (white) or middle (light gray) of the vials or stayed at the bottom (dark gray). Ages (d, days after eclosion) are indicated on the top of the graph. Percentages of flies that stayed at the bottom were subjected to statistical analyses. Means ± SEM, n = 8; ∗∗∗p < 0.001 by Student’s t-test. The genotypes of the flies were as follows: (Control): elav-GAL4/Y, (Aβ42): elav-GAL4/Y; UAS-Aβ42/+.\nNote: The climbing assay requires 125–150 flies (n=5–6) to obtain consistent results. The endpoint may vary depending on the health and survival rate of the flies under the experimental conditions. From our experience, survival rates in each vial should be greater than 60% to obtain consistent results.\nHistological analysis\nTiming: > 4 days (Age of flies: 3–4 weeks after eclosion)",
    "Under our experimental conditions, Aβ42 flies exhibit age-dependent neurodegeneration in the brain at the age of 4 weeks. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining of paraffin section enable visualization of neurodegeneration in fly brains. Neuron loss and neuropil degeneration appear as vacuolation (Kretzschmar et al., 1997[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) in the cell body area (purple in H&E staining) or neuropil area (pink in H&E staining). We usually focus on the Kenyon cell body area, as neuron loss is evident when Aβ42 is expressed under the elavc155-GAL4 driver, and these neurons are important for learning and memory in Drosophila (Dubnau et al., 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nCollect male flies from the experimental group (elavc155-GAL4/Y; UAS-Aβ42/+) or control group (elavc155-GAL4/Y) and age them until the age of 4 weeks.\nDay 1: Dissect the flies.\nAnesthetize the fly using CO2 gas.\nRinse the fly in 100% ethanol to wash out the wax, and place the fly in an embryo dish filled with PBS.\nUnder the stereomicroscope with light sources, keep the fly face-up using “No. 5” forceps (inox 08, DUMONT) and remove the proboscis.\nRemove the air sac from the site of the proboscis to easily immerse the brain in fixative.\nRemove the head from the abdomen and place it in the fixative.\nFix fly heads with 400 μL of 4% PFA/PBS in 1.5 mL microtube at 4°C for 16–20 h.\nDay 2: Processing.\nThe next day, remove the fly heads from the 1.5 mL microtube using a disposable dropper and place them into the mesh bag (six fly heads/bag).\nRemove the fixative and place the bag in the tissue processing cassette (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/623-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Serial sections should be prepared as ribbons of sections (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D).\nCut the ribbons of sections (10–12 sections) and float them on warmed distilled water (38°C–40°C) in the water bath.\nWhen the sections completely flatten out on the water, pick up the ribbon of sections using a slide glass (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]E).\nStand the slide for more than 12 h at room temperature (20°C–25°C) to dry out the ribbon of sections (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]F).\nDay 4: H&E staining.",

    "Note: Analysis of neurodegeneration in Aβ42 fly brains requires at least 10 flies (n=10 × 2 hemispheres) to obtain consistent results. The severity of neurodegeneration may vary depending on the health and survival rate of flies under experimental conditions.\nDetection of Aβ42 by western blot\nTiming: > 3 days (Age of flies: 1–4 weeks after eclosion)\nAβ42 peptides expressed in fly heads aggregate and accumulate upon aging; however, it is not possible to distinguish between soluble Aβ42 and β-sheet–rich insoluble Aβ42 by conventional western blotting. Using this fractionation method for fly head lysates, soluble and insoluble Aβ42 can be quantified separately. Detergent-soluble and -insoluble Aβ42 can be sequentially extracted from fly heads by RIPA/SDS buffer followed by formic acid treatment.\nCollect male flies from the experimental group (elavc155-GAL4/Y; UAS-Aβ42/+) or control group (elavc155-GAL4/Y) and age them.\nAt the age of interest, anesthetize flies with CO2 gas and place them in a 1.5 mL tube followed by flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. The flash-frozen flies are stored at −80°C until use.\nRIPA/SDS extraction of Aβ42 from fly heads.\nPlace the 1.5 mL tubes containing 20–25 frozen flies in a Dewar vessel containing liquid nitrogen.\nPick up a tube using forceps and quickly place it in a 50 mL conical centrifuge tube.\nShake the tubes to physically divide fly heads and abdomens.\nRemove the contents of the 1.5 mL tube onto weighing paper (or a weighing dish) on ice and collect 20 fly heads in a new 1.5 mL tube.\nAdd 200 μL RIPA/SDS buffer to the tube and homogenize using a micro-pestle.\nIncubate on ice for 1 h (vortex the tube every 20 min).\nSpin the tubes at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4˚C.\nTransfer the supernatant (RIPA/SDS soluble fraction) to a new tube.",
