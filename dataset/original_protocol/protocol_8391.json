    "1. Design, Preparation, and Expression of the  lux  Operon in  Escherichia coli\nNote: See Table of Materials for information on commercial kits used in this section.\nFor transferring the lux operon into E. coli choose a standard pET vector with appropriate restriction sites and antibiotic resistance gene of interest (e.g., pET28a; NcoI, XhoI, kanamycin).\nDesign the fragments and overlapping primers for Gibson assembly based on the DNA sequence of Photobacterium mandapamensis 27561 (GenBank: DQ988878.2).\nSet up a standard PCR reaction with the designed primers and the isolated genomic DNA of Photobacterium mandapamensis 27561 as template (see Supplemental Material for primers and conditions).\n\tNOTE: Isolation of genomic DNA of the respective bacterial strain enhances PCR efficacy.\nPurify the PCR product via spin-column purification.\nPerform a restriction digestion of the isolated pET28a vector with NcoI and XhoI at 37 °C for 45 min.\nPurify the linearized vector and the PCR fragments via agarose gel electrophoresis and subsequent spin-column purification.\nDetermine the DNA concentration of each fragment and the linearized vector and calculate the optimal quantities for the assembly according to the protocol20,21.\n\tNOTE: Efficacy of assembly depends on fragment size and number and has to be adjusted according to manufacturer's protocol20,21.\nAfter combining all fragments and the buffer in a PCR tube, incubate the assembly mixture in a PCR machine at 50 °C for 1 h.\nTransform the assembled vector product according to standard transformation protocols for E. coli bacterial plasmid transformation into an appropriate E. coli system for high yield plasmid replication (e.g., E. coli TOP10 or XL-1).\nPick colonies from the transformation plate and streak on new plates for DNA isolation.\nIsolate plasmid DNA according to standard protocols.",
    "To verify the correct assembly of the plasmid including all fragments, first perform a colony PCR according to standard protocols using primers specific for every assembled fragment.\nAdditionally to the colony PCR and subsequent agarose gel electrophoresis, prepare all isolated assembly vectors for DNA sequencing to verify the correct assembly and the correct DNA sequences.\nTransform the verified plasmid according to standard transformation protocols for E. coli bacterial plasmid transformation into an appropriate E. coli system for high yield protein production (e.g.,E. coli BL21).\n\tNOTE: Continue directly with expression protocol below. For longer storage, the preparation of a glycerol stock is recommended.\n2. Expression of Modified  E. coli  Strains\nPrepare an overnight culture (ONC) for expression by inoculation of an appropriate volume of LB medium (e.g., 100 mL) with the previously prepared glycerol stock of the E. coli BL21 cells transformed with the assembled plasmid or directly from a transformation plate. Add 100 µL of kanamycin (50 mg/mL; antibiotic resistance gene of pET28a) and incubate the ONC at 37 °C and 120 rpm in an incubator shaker overnight.\nInoculate the main expression culture (e.g., 800 mL of LB medium) with 8 mL of the ONC and add 800 µL of kanamycin (50 mg/mL).\nIncubate the main culture at 37 °C and 120 rpm in an incubator shaker until the cell density reaches an OD600 of 0.6 - 0.8 (approximately 2.5 h).\nReduce the incubation temperature to 28 °C.\nInduce protein expression by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 0.1 mM.\n\tNOTE: Empirical tests showed that the reduction of the temperature to 28 °C gave the highest light intensity.\nObserve cells until they start shining (approximately 1 h).",
    "NOTE: Depending on the purpose of the expression, the cells are grown until the next day and are then harvested, or the cells can be kept shaking as long as they are shining (maximum 48 h). Harvesting the cells and purification of any proteins can be done according to standard procedures.\n3. Expression of Bacterial Bioluminescent Strains\nNOTE: Bacterial bioluminescent strains require specific growth medium/artificial sea water medium for growth and light production.\nPrepare artificial sea water medium, composed of two separately prepared medium components.\n\t​NOTE: The preparation of the artificial sea water medium was adapted from the original protocol22. The following amounts are for 1 L liquid medium or 1 L agar medium.\n\t\nFor artificial sea water medium, weigh in the following salts: 28.13 g NaCl, 0.77 g KCl, 1.60 g CaCl2 · 2H2O, 4.80 g MgCl2 · 6H2O, 0.11 g NaHCO3, and 3.50 g MgSO4 · 7H2O.\nAdd 1 L of distilled water and dissolve all components.\nFor LB medium, weigh in the following ingredients: 10 g yeast extract, 10 g peptone, and for agar plates, an additional 20 g agar.\nAdd 250 mL of tap water and dissolve components.\nAutoclave both prepared media separately at 121 °C for 20 min.\nFor agar plates, combine 250 mL of LB medium with 750 mL of artificial sea water medium directly after autoclaving and prepare plates.\nFor liquid medium, combine 250 mL of LB medium with 750 mL of artificial sea water medium either directly after autoclaving or when cooled down.\n\t\tNOTE: The artificial sea water medium may get turbid through salt precipitation.\nStreak the bacterial bioluminescent strains on artificial sea water medium agar plates and incubate overnight at 24 - 30 °C.",
    "NOTE: Long time storage of bacterial strains is normally achieved through freezing glycerol stocks of the bacterial culture. Strains should always be streaked on agar plates first to assure uniform starting conditions for all strains, prior to usage for liquid cultures, due to a lag phase in growth after thawing.\nPrepare an ONC by inoculating 100 mL artificial sea water medium with a single colony from the plate. Incubate the ONC at 24 - 30 °C and 120 rpm in an incubator shaker overnight.\nInoculate 800 mL of artificial sea water medium with 8 mL of ONC.\nIncubate the bacterial cells at 24 - 30 °C and 120 rpm in an incubator shaker.\n\tNOTE: The light intensity profile of bioluminescent bacteria strongly varies with temperature. Depending on the regulatory mechanisms of the light production of the respective bacterial strain, light emission may start after approximately 1 - 6 h.\nObserve bacterial cell culture until they start shining (approximately 1 - 6 h).\n\tNOTE: Depending on the purpose of the expression, the cells are grown until the next day and are then harvested, or the cells can be kept shaking as long as they are shining. Harvesting the cells and purification of any proteins can be done according to standard procedures.\n4. In Vivo Activity Assay for Bacterial Bioluminescent Strains and Modified E. coli Strains\nNOTE: Long time storage of strains is normally acieved through freezing glycerol stocks of the bacterial culture. Strains should always be streaked on agar plates first to assure uniform starting conditions for all strains, prior to usage for liquid cultures, due to a lag phase in growth after thawing.\nStreak the desired bioluminescent bacterial strain or modified E. coli strain on an agar plate and incubate at 28 °C overnight.",
    "NOTE: The incubation temperature can vary from strain to strain and has to be evaluated empirically. To be able to compare bioluminescent bacterial strains and modified E. coli strains, growth conditions have to be identical.\nInoculate 3 mL of medium with the respective strain with a single colony from an agar plate and incubate the cells at 28 °C and 180 rpm in an incubator shaker for approximately 1 - 2 h.\nMeasure the cell density of a 1:10 dilution of the liquid culture at 650 nm. Calculate the ratio and volume for 1 mL culture with an OD650 of 0.05.\n\tNOTE: The subsequent plate reader assay will determine the cell density at 650 nm to avoid interference by the light emission of the strains.\nPipette the calculated volume of culture and medium into a 24-well black-walled plate with glass bottom. For the modified E. coli strain, add 1 µL of kanamycin (antibiotic resistance of pET28a vector) and 1 µL of IPTG (induction of gene expression) to the samples. Place a lid on the plate to avoid evaporation during the measurements.\n\tNOTE: To assure that the pET28a vector containing the whole lux operon does not get lost by the E. coli culture, kanamycin must be added to each E. coli sample in the plate wells and to assure that light production of the E. coli cells can be measured, the gene expression must be induced by IPTG. To avoid crosstalk and measurement interference, black-walled well plates with glass bottom and transparent lid showed best results. Nevertheless, crosstalk can be observed and well positions have to be chosen carefully.\nStart the measurement in a plate reader.",
    "NOTE: The plate reader protocol is based on a script specially developed for this assay (see Supplemental Material) that combines two measurements, absorbance and bioluminescence. Data points are collected every 10 min with permanent shaking between the measurements and a constant temperature of 28 °C."
