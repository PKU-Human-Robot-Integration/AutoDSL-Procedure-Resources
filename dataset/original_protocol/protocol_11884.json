    "The protocol for human blastocyst biopsy, here described, follows the guidelines of G.EN.E.R.A. Human Research Ethic Committee.\nNOTE: Refer to the Table of Materials for materials required. Further material required entails laboratory footwear and outfit, surgical facemask, hair cover, surgical gloves, a permanent non-toxic marker, forceps and disinfectant. The use of surgical gown, disposable surgical gloves, facemask, hair cover is mandatory to prevent risk of contamination. All the working areas, as well as the equipment involved in the process, must be cleaned thoroughly with laboratory disinfectant (e.g., Oosafe) before starting any procedure. All consumables and media used should be sterile and individually packaged or aliquoted. It is suggested to use a dedicated workstation for biopsy and tubing and limit the access of the area only to the operators involved in the procedure (embryologist and witness).\n1. Preparation on the Day Before the Biopsy Procedure\nPrepare the post biopsy culture dish.\nPlace 6 drops of 20 µL IVF culture medium (Table of Materials) in an IVF culture dish and overlay with 6 mL of prewarmed mineral oil for embryo culture (Table of Materials).\nAdd another 10 µL of IVF culture medium to each drop. Incubate overnight at 37 °C in a controlled atmosphere (5% O2, 6% CO2).\nPrepare an IVF dish 4-well plate for rinsing the blastocyst after biopsy.\nPlace 600 µL of IVF culture medium in the first two wells and overlay with 300 µL of pre-warmed mineral oil for embryo culture.\nIncubate overnight at 37 °C in a controlled atmosphere (5% O2, 6% CO2).\nDispense 1.5 µL of loading solution (Table of Materials) in each PCR tube to be used for TE cells tubing, spin it and keep it at 4 °C.\n2. Preparation on the Day of the Biopsy Procedure\nPrepare the biopsy dish.",
    "Place 3 drops of 10 µL HEPES-buffered medium (supplemented with human serum albumin) (Table of Materials) in a row in an IVF culture dish.\nRepeat step 1.1.1 according to the number of blastocysts available (up to 4 blastocysts per dish) and overlay with 6 mL of pre-warmed mineral oil for embryo culture.\nIncubate the dish at 37 °C for at least 1 h before performing the biopsy procedure.\n3. Blastocyst Selection and Grading\nGrade the blastocyst according to its expansion and the morphological appearance of ICM and TE (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: The grading criteria have been adapted from Gardner and Schoolcraft15 and previously described by Capalbo et al. and Cimadomo et al.4,11.\n\t\nDefine the size and expansion grade as: A for a fully-hatched blastocyst, B for a hatching blastocyst, C for a fully expanded blastocyst, and D for a not expanded blastocyst (these embryos are biopsied only if they did not expand further up to day 7).\nDefine ICM grade: 1 for noticeable ICM with several strictly-packed cells; 2 for discernable with several but roughly-packed cells; 3 for difficult to distinguish with very few low-quality cells.\nDefine TE grade as follows: 1 for well-organized epithelium with several cells; 2 for loose epithelium with few cells; 3 for few and/or large low-quality cells.\n4. Trophectoderm Biopsy\nPerform TE biopsy on all the viable fully-expanded blastocysts (preferably C grade for size and expansion).\nSet holding and biopsy pipettes for each biopsy procedure. The recommendations for the biopsy pipette are the following: 30 µm internal diameter, 35° bend angle, 0.75 mm distance tip to bend.\nLabel the biopsy dish with patient’s details (woman’s name and surname, date of birth and ID) and then number each drop with embryo and cycle IDs. Use a permanent non-toxic marker.",
    "Transfer the blastocyst with a 300 µm stripping pipette to the first drop of the biopsy dish and rinse it in order to remove the excess of culture medium. Then move the blastocyst in the second drop of the biopsy dish.\nMove the dish to the inverted microscope and prime the biopsy pipette aspirating some medium from the third drop of the biopsy dish.\nAt 20x magnification, orient the blastocyst to have a clear view of the ICM. When it is visualized at 7 o’clock (opposite to the area that will be targeted to remove the TE cells), secure the embryo on the holding pipette (Figure 2a).\nFocus on the zona pellucida and ascertain that both the pipettes and the blastocyst are on the same focal plane.\nSwitch to the laser objective (pulse time 0.3 ms, 6.5 µm) and position the laser pointer on the zona pellucida at the opposite side of ICM. Drill the zona pellucida through 2−3 laser pulses (Figure 2b).\nGently press the biopsy pipette against the zona pellucida and blow some medium through the breach to detach the TE cells from its internal surface and expedite blastocyst collapse (Figure 2c).\nOnce the TE is detached (Figure 2d), enter through the hole (if required, make it wider with a last laser pulse) and aspirate few TE cells (ideally 7−813,16) into the biopsy pipette with gentle suction (Figure 2e).\nSlightly move the biopsy pipette backwards while applying a moderate suction to stretch the target cells (Figure 2f).",
    "Direct the laser towards the thinnest part of the aspirated cells and fire 2−5 laser pulses at the junctions between cells to separate the target cells from the body of the embryo (Figure 2g). The timing of laser pulses and the number of pulses can be adjusted according to the quality of the blastocyst; however, try to minimize them to avoid cell lysis.\nAfter the separation of the TE fragment from the blastocyst (Figure 2h), release it into the same biopsy drop far from the blastocyst. This is needed to prevent them from being sucked again into the biopsy pipette (Figure 2i).\nRelease the blastocyst from the holding pipette and promptly raise both pipettes to prevent the fragment from sticking to them.\nTake a picture of the biopsied fragment for quality control purpose (Figure 3).\n\tNOTE: If more than a single blastocyst is to be biopsied per procedure (up to four per biopsy dish), change the biopsy pipette with a new one to prevent cross-contamination between embryos.\nRepeat steps 4.1−4.13.\nMove the biopsy dish back to the laminar flow hood.\nLabel the post-biopsy culture dish with the couple ID, and each drop with the embryo and the cycle ID.\nIn presence of a witness, rinse the blastocyst in clean IVF medium, and lastly move it to its corresponding drop of the post-biopsy dish.\nMove the post-biopsy dish to the incubator in a controlled atmosphere (37 °C, 6% CO2, 5% O2) until vitrification. It is advisable to perform vitrification within 30 min from the biopsy procedure, to prevent blastocyst re-expansion.\n5. Tubing",
    "NOTE: The whole procedure must be carried out in the presence of a witness and inside the laminar flow hood at room temperature. During the procedure, keep the PCR tubes in a cold tube rack on ice (Supplementary Figure 1).\nLabel the PCR tubes with a permanent non-toxic marker.\nNOTE: Labeling should be performed as requested by the genetic laboratory. Generally, patient’s name and surname (initials), couple ID, embryo and cycle ID (for instance: JD 12345 1.2 for the embryo N.1 of 2nd cycle belonging to Jane Doe whose couple ID is 12345). Embryo ID should be reported also in letters on the body of the tube.\nLabel the lid of a 60 mm x 15 mm culture dish (tubing dish) with the biopsied embryos’ IDs (Supplementary Figure 1) and prepare two 10 µL drops of biopsy washing solution (Table of Materials) in it.\nPrime the 140 µm stripping pipette (Supplementary Figure 1) with some biopsy washing solution from the second drop of the tubing dish.\nPlace the biopsy dish under the stereomicroscope to easily visualize the TE fragment(s).\nGently release some biopsy washing solution upon the TE fragment; then, load it into the stripping pipette.\nMove the TE fragment to the second drop of biopsy washing solution in the tubing dish and carefully rinse it 2−3 times.\nTransfer the TE fragment to the bottom of the PCR tube (previously labeled after it) with loading solution, paying attention to avoid touching its walls with the tip of the stripping pipette.\nRepeat the procedure from step 5.3 to step 5.7 for each TE fragment, paying attention to use a new capillary for every TE fragment.\nAt the end of the tubing procedure, put all the PCR tubes in a mini centrifuge, and spin them for few seconds.",
    "Store the samples at -20 °C until shipping them to the referring genetic laboratory for testing.\n6. Blastocyst Vitrification\nVitrify collapsed blastocysts within 30 min from TE biopsy to prevent their re-expansion.\nLabel the vitrification plate with woman’s details and the IDs of the blastocysts that must be vitrified.\nLabel the vitrification support(s) with woman’s name and surname, couple ID, ID of the embryo that will be loaded on it, as well as date of the procedure. Special cryolabels are used which preserve their integrity even at very low temperature (-196 °C).\nAt room temperature, dispense 0.3 mL of equilibration solution (ES) (Table of Materials) for each blastocyst that will be vitrified.\nIn the presence of a witness, move the blastocyst in ES using the 300 µm stripping pipette.\nLeave the blastocyst in the ES for 13−15 min. After an initial shrinkage of the volume, a gradual re-expansion will be observed.\nFill a small cooling rack with liquid nitrogen (LN2) and place it under the laminar flow hood.\nDispense 300 μL of vitrification solution (VS) (Table of Materials) in the second well. After the blastocyst complete re-expansion, transfer it in the VS solution for 1 min and rinse it to dilute the ES.\nIn presence of a witness, load the blastocyst on the vitrification support and take care of removing the excess of VS. A subtle film of solution should surround the blastocyst.\nPlunge the vitrification support into LN2 and move it energetically in order to reduce the risk of bubble formation close to the specimen.\nPlace the protective cap while keeping the vitrification support submerged in the LN2.\nIn the presence of a witness, move the vitrification support in a long term LN2 storage tank.\n7. Artificial shrinkage of Non-biopsied Blastocysts",
    "If no TE biopsy is conducted, artificially collapse the blastocysts immediately before vitrification (Figure 4).\nMove the culture dish from the incubator to the inverted microscope and focus on the selected embryo.\nSwitch to the laser objective (pre-set pulse: 0.3 ms, 6.5 μm), target the zona pellucida at the opposite side of ICM, then direct 1–2 laser pulses to the junctions between TE cells at a safe distance from the ICM. The blastocysts should collapse in less than 5 min.\nProceed with the vitrification of the collapsed blastocyst as described in section 6.\n8. Transferable Blastocyst Warming\nOn the day of the ET, prepare the ET 4-well plate by placing 600 µL of pre-equilibrated IVF culture medium for each well. Incubate at 37 °C in a controlled atmosphere (5% O2, 6% CO2), while performing blastocyst warming.\nLabel the warming dish with woman’s name and surname, couple ID, ID of the embryo that will be warmed in it.\nDispense 1 mL of the thawing solution (TS) (Table of Materials) in an IVF one-well dish (Supplementary Figure 1) and warm it to 37 °C in a thermostat for at least 1 h before starting the procedure.\nFill a small cooling support with LN2 and place it in the laminar flow hood in close proximity of the working area.\nBefore starting the procedure, check the blastocyst information reported on the vitrification support. All the IDs should match the genetic report and the blastocyst to warm must be chosen among the transferable ones. A witness is required during the procedure.\nTake the one-well dish containing warmed TS out of the thermostat and place it on a heated stage under the stereomicroscope.\nPull over the protective cap within the LN2 using forceps.\nPlunge quickly the tip of the vitrification support into the 37 °C TS.",
    "Under microscopic observation, gently move the vitrification support until the blastocyst is released from the tip.\nLeave the blastocyst for a total of 1 min in the TS, paying attention to keep it at the bottom of the TS.\nAt room temperature dispense 200 μL of dilution solution (DS) (Table of Materials) on the first well of the vitrification plate.\nTransfer the blastocyst to DS and place it at the bottom of the well while releasing some TS on the top of it to create a sort of gradient. Leave it for 3 min.\nDispense 200 μL of washing solution (WS) in 2 different wells (WS1 and WS2).\nTransfer the blastocyst to WS1 and place it on the bottom of the well while releasing some DS medium on the top of it. Then transfer the blastocyst to WS2 and leave it undisturbed for 1 min.\nLabel the post-warming ET plate with woman’s name and surname, couple ID, ID of the embryo that will be cultured in it.\nIn the presence of a witness, transfer the warmed blastocyst to pre-equilibrated culture medium in the post-warming ET plate.\nRinse the blastocyst in the first well of the ET plate and place it in the second well.\nTransfer the post-warming culture dish to the incubator in a controlled atmosphere (37 °C, 6% CO2, 5% O2) and culture the blastocyst for at least 1.5 h before checking its survival and re-expansion.\nNOTE: Figure 5 shows examples of degenerated, cryo-survived but not re-expanded and cryo-survived and fully-expanded blastocysts.\n9. EmbryoTransfer\nTo perform ET, place the dish on the heated stage of the laminar flow hood, so the embryo is visible under the microscope at a low magnification.",
    "Take about 0.4 mL of IVF culture medium. Secure the syringe tip firmly into the receiving end of the internal catheter and then release the medium up to 0.1 mL.\nAspirate culture medium until observing the embryos entering the catheter (minimal amount of media: 10−15 μL).\nPlace the catheter into the plastic case and go to the operating room and place the internal catheter into the external guide.\nOnce reached the uterus, push the syringe plunger to release the embryo(s). Release very slowly the medium until the plunger is reading 0.1 mL.\nTake the catheter back to the lab and check under the microscope that the embryo has been transferred.\nSubscription Required.
