    "All experimental protocols described were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Nanchang University (Nanchang, PR China, Ethical No.2017-010). All efforts were made to minimize the stress and pain of the experimental animals. The electrophysiological recordings performed here were carried out at room temperature (RT, 22–25 °C).\n1. Animals\nUse Sprague-Dawley rats (3–5 weeks old) of either sex. House the animals under a 12 h light-dark cycle and give them ad libitum access to adequate food and water.\n2. Preparation of Solutions and Materials\nSolutions\n\t\nPrepare artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) (in mM): 117 NaCl, 3.6 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4·2H2O, 2.5 CaCl2·2H2O, 1.2 MgCl2·6H2O, 25 NaHCO3, 11 D-glucose, 0.4 ascorbic acid, and 2 sodium pyruvate. See Table 1.\nPrepare sucrose-ACSF (in mM): 240 Sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4·2H2O, 0.5 CaCl2·2H2O, 3.5 MgCl2·6H2O, 25 NaHCO3, 0.4 Ascorbic acid, and 2 sodium pyruvate. See Table 2.\nPrepare K+-based intracellular solution (in mM): 130 K-gluconate, 5 KCl, 10 Na2-phosphocreatine, 0.5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 4 Mg-ATP, and 0.3 Li-GTP. See Table 3.\nPrepare Cs+-based intracellular solution (in mM): 92 CsMeSO4, 43 CsCl, 10 Na2-phosphocreatine, 5 tetraethylammonium (TEA)-Cl, 0.5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 4 Mg-ATP, and 0.3 Li-GTP. See Table 4.",
    "Note: All solutions must be prepared using distilled water. ACSF and sucrose-ACSF should be carbogenated (95% O2 and 5% CO2 mixture) prior to use to maintain an optimal pH of approximately 7.4, and the osmolality of these two solutions should be adjusted to 300–310 mOsm. Because ascorbic acid could affect calcium channels, this agent must be omitted if one would like to record calcium currents. The osmolality and pH of intracellular solutions should be measured and adjusted to 290–300 mOsm and 7.2–7.3, respectively. It is recommended to filter the intracellular solutions with 0.2 µm filters and store the solutions as 1 mL aliquots at -20 °C. Cs+ and TEA are applied in Cs+-based intracellular solution to block potassium channel, which is conducive to using the amplifier to hold the membrane potential steady at 0 mV when recording inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs).\nPrepare the 0.05% neurobiotin 488 solution. Dissolve 2 mg of neurobiotin 488 in 4 mL of K+-based intracellular solution and adjust the osmolality to 290–300 mOsm by using distilled water or sucrose if needed.\n\t\tNote: 1 mM of sucrose increases osmolarity by 1 mOsm.\nPrepare 3% agar as a block for spinal cord. Dissolve 7.5 g of agar in 250 mL of purified water in a glass beaker, and then use a microwave to heat it until boiling and clear. Swirl the solution and pour the mixture into a 17.5 cm x 10.5 cm x 1.8 cm plastic box for solidification afterwards. Keep the agar at 4 °C prior to use.",
    "Prepare 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for immunohistochemical processing. Mix 40 g of PFA powder to ~800 mL of heated (approximately 60 °C) 1x PBS solution (130 mM NaCl, 7 mM Na2HPO4, 3 mM NaH2PO4). Slowly adjust the pH by adding 1 N NaOH drops until PFA powder is completely dissolved. Once the solution has become clear, adjust the total volume to 1 L with 1x PBS. Readjust the pH to 7.2–7.4 using 1 N HCl when needed, then filter the 4% PFA solution and store it at -20 °C until use.\n\t\tNote: PFA is toxic, so it is needed to wear masks, gloves as well as safety glasses. Conduct the process of preparing 4% PFA inside a ventilated hood. PFA powder can be completely dissolved at a pH of approximately 9–10.\nInstruments\nFor a typical electrophysiological system, use an upright microscope equipped with infrared differential interference contrast (IR-DIC) and a high-resolution water-immersion objective, a CCD/CMOS camera, a patch-clamp amplifier, a micropipette holder and a micromanipulator allowing fine adjustment of the pipette position. An XY stage is also needed to move the microscope.\nMount all equipment on a vibration isolation table surrounded by a Faraday cage. Connect a video monitor to the video camera to observe the neurons and visualize the micropipettes.\nMicropipettes\nMake recording electrodes from borosilicate glass capillaries using a micropipette puller. The typical pipette resistance ranges from 3-6 MΩ when filled with intracellular solution.\nAgar block\nPrepare a 1.2 cm x 1.5 cm x 2.0 cm agar block. Trim the block into the shapes shown in Figure 1 as required.\n3. Acute Spinal Cord Slice Preparation\nNote: Transverse or parasagittal spinal cord slices are prepared as previously described18,19,20.",
    "Prior to transcardial perfusion and spinal cord extraction, prepare ~500 mL sucrose-ACSF equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 and cool the solution to ice-cold (0–4 °C).\nCool down all the dissection tools (e.g., dissecting scissors, iris scissors, toothed forceps, fine forceps, curved forceps) on the ice. The diagram of the preparation of acute spinal cord slice is shown in Figure 1.\nTranscardial perfusion\n\t\nAfter a single injection (intraperitoneal, i.p.) of urethane (1.5 g/kg), wait for 2–3 min, and assess the anesthesia depth of rats by testing toe or tail pinch responses. Once a surgical plane of anesthesia is maintained, place the rat on crushed ice in the supine position.\n\t\tNote: For producing profound anesthesia sufficient for non-perception of pain during thoracotomy, follow your local IACUC guidelines.\nMake an incision (3–4 cm) through the skin from the xiphoid process to the clavicle, and then make a transverse incision beneath the level of the xiphoid process.\nGrasp and raise the xiphoid process with a pair of curved forceps to expose the diaphragm completely. Make a transverse incision through the diaphragm, and then cut through the ribcage between the breastbone and ribs bilaterally to open the chest cavity. Use the curved forceps to grasp the xiphoid process so the ribcage is fixed, and the heart is sufficiently exposed.\nHold the heart with another curved forceps gently, and then insert a 22 G needle through the left ventricle to the base of the aortic arch.\nCut the right atrium with fine scissors immediately, and then start the perfusion of ice-cold, oxygenated sucrose-ACSF through a gravity system.",
    "Note: Rapid and sufficient transcardial perfusion with ice-cold sucrose-ACSF can facilitate the rapid cooling of the spinal cord, while low sodium and calcium concentration may help alleviate excitatory toxicity and protect neuronal function. In addition, clearing red blood cells would be beneficial for reducing the background staining of biocytin when performing a morphological study. The perfusion is considered sufficient and satisfied as long as the fluid exiting the right atrium is clear and the color of the rat’s liver and paws is pale. The tip of the 22 G needle should be blunt to avoid rupturing the heart and aortic arch.\nSpinal cord dissection and slicing\n\t\nMake a longitudinal incision (5 cm) on the back skin from caudal to rostral, then cut through the ribcage between the spine and ribs on either side in the state of perfusion.\nMake a cut at the caudal end of the spine, use scissors to cut away surrounding tissues, and isolate the lumbosacral segment of the spine rapidly.\nTransfer the lumbosacral segment to a glass dish containing ice-cold sucrose-based ACSF. With the ventral side upward, use fine scissors to cut through the vertebral pedicle bilaterally and expose the spinal cord carefully. Isolate a 2-cm long spinal cord with lumbosacral enlargement (L1–S3) and transfer the spinal section to another glass dish filled with cold sucrose-ACSF.\nRemove the meninges and the pia-arachnoid membrane under a dissecting microscope. Cut all the ventral and dorsal roots away as quickly as possible.",
    "Place the spinal cord on a previously trimmed agar block. To prepare transverse slices, attach the ventral side of the spinal cord to the agar and let the dorsal side toward the blade. To prepare parasagittal slices, attach the ventral side with superglue to the agar in a vertical direction as shown in Figure 1. Then, mount the agar block to a platform of a vibratome with superglue. Prepare 300–500 µm transverse or parasagittal slices with an advance speed of 0.025 mm/s and a vibration frequency of 80 Hz.\nUse a plastic-trimmed pipette to transfer the slices onto nylon mesh in a storage chamber containing continuously oxygenated ACSF at 32 °C for at least 30 min prior to recording.\n\t\tNote: Take care to avoid injury to the spinal cord, especially the dorsal horn, when removing the meninges and spinal roots. The spinal cord should be sliced dorsal-ventrally. For the best results, the slices should be prepared rapidly (within 15–20 min). The thickness of a spinal slice should be no more than 600 µm to satisfy cell visibility. In addition, the technique described above could be used to obtain horizontal spinal slices.\n4. Whole-cell Patch-clamp Recordings\nTo conduct the whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from SG neurons, use K+-based intracellular solution for most recording cases, while applying Cs+-based solution only for the recording of inhibitory postsynaptic currents.\nGently move a spinal cord slice to the recording chamber, and then maintain it with a U-shaped platinum wire attached with nylon threads firmly for optimal slice stability. Steadily perfuse the slice with bubbled ACSF at RT through a gravity system and set the perfusion rate at 2–4 mL/min to achieve sufficient oxygenation.",
    "Identify the region of SG (a translucent band) using a low-resolution microscope lens, choose a healthy neuron by using the high-resolution objective as the target cell, and adjust it to the center of the video monitor screen.\nFill a micropipette with an appropriate volume of K+-based or Cs+-based intracellular solution as needed, insert the micropipette into the electrode holder, and ensure that the intracellular solution is contacting the silver wire inside the holder.\nBring the micropipette into focus and immerse it into the ACSF using a micromanipulator, and then apply a mild positive pressure (~1 psi when measured with a manometer) to force the micropipette away from any dirt and debris.\nMove the micropipette towards the targeted neuron gradually. Release the positive pressure once the pipette approaches the neuron and a very small dimple forms on neuronal membrane to form a gigaseal.\nAlter the holding potential to -70 mV, which is close to the physiological resting membrane potential (RMP) of a cell. Then, apply a transient and gentle suction to the micropipette to rupture the membrane and create a good whole-cell configuration.",
    "Note: After transferring the slice into the recording chamber, ensure steady perfusion for at least 5 min to clear the debris on the slice surface. It is worth noting that the ability to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy/dead neurons is of paramount importance for good sealing and stable recording. An unhealthy/dead neuron has a swollen or shrunken appearance, together with a visible large nucleus, while a healthy neuron is characterized by a 3-dimensional (3D) shape with a bright and smooth membrane, and its nucleus is invisible. To achieve a whole-cell configuration, it is essential to compensate for fast or slow capacitance step-by-step when necessary. At RT, the liquid junction potential is calculated to be 15.1–15.2 mV and 4.3–4.4 mV in K+-based and Cs+-based intracellular solution, respectively. In our studies, the recorded data were not corrected for liquid junction potential.\nRecordings of intrinsic membrane properties\n\t\nRecord passive intrinsic membrane properties: Record RMP immediately (within 20 s) after break in. Determine the neuronal input resistance by measuring the voltage response to a depolarizing current (10 pA, 500 ms) at RMP in current-clamp mode.\nRecord firing properties: Test the firing pattern of each neuron in current-clamp with a series of 1 s depolarizing current pulses (25–150 pA with 25 pA increment) at RMP. Measure the threshold, amplitude and half-width of a single action potential offline.\nRecord subthreshold current: To assess the somatic subthreshold currents, hold the membrane potential at -50 mV in voltage-clamp mode. Then, apply a series of hyperpolarizing voltage pulses of 1 s duration from -60 mV to -120 mV, with a 10-mV decrement.\nRecord excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs): Record EPSCs with the K+-based intracellular solution in voltage-clamp mode at a holding potential of -70 mV.",
    "Record IPSCs: Apply Cs+-based intracellular solution for recording IPSCs. Once the whole-cell configuration is established, hold the membrane potential at -70 mV for ~5 min, and then change the holding potential to 0 mV gradually. Wait a few minutes for stabilization, and then start to record the IPSC events.\n\t\tNote: Only neurons with an RMP less than -50 mV and showing overshoot should be selected for further study. The series resistances in our study are typically 10-30 MΩ, and a recording should be excluded once the series resistance changes by more than 20%. EPSCs could be confirmed with a bath application of 50 µM APV and 20 µM CNQX, while IPSCs could be confirmed with 10 µM bicuculline and 1 µM strychnine.\n5. Morphological study\nFor morphological experiments, use a K+-based intracellular solution containing 0.05% neurobiotin 488.\nAfter maintaining a stable electrophysiological recording for at least 20 min, slowly remove the micropipette in the upward direction to allow the cell membrane to reseal and transfer the spinal cord slice to a container filled with 4% PFA. Fix the slices in 4% PFA at RT for 1 h and then at 4°C overnight.\nRinse the slices in PBS, and then immerse them in 50% ethanol for 30 min. After another three washes in PBS, mount the slices in their original thickness onto slides with a mounting medium.\nUse a confocal microscope (see Table of Materials) for image acquisition and neuronal 3D reconstruction. Scan neurons through a 20X lens with a z-stack of 1.5 µm.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
