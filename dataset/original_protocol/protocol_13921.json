    "Twelve-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jax Labs. All mice were housed in groups of 3–5 mice per micro-isolator cage in a room with a 12 h light/dark schedule. All animal procedures were performed according to the National Institute of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Pennsylvania State University.\n1. Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) surgical model\nAnesthetize mice using a ketamine (100 mg/kg)/xylazine (10 mg/kg) combination via intraperitoneal injection, administer buprenorphine (1 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection for pain relief, and shave the hair over the knee. Check for the lack of a pedal reflex before starting the surgery.\nPerform destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) surgery as previously described22,23.\n\tNOTE: Please refer to Glasson et al. and Singh et al. references for more detailed surgical protocol information22,23.\n\t\nMake a 3 mm longitudinal incision from the distal patella to the proximal tibial plateau of the right knee joint. Use a suture to displace the patellar tendon.\nOpen the joint capsule medial to the tendon and move the infrapatellar fat pad to visualize the intercondylar region, medial meniscus, and meniscotibial ligament23.\nTransect the medial meniscotibial ligament to complete DMM and destabilize the joint22,23. Close the incision site with staples or sutures.\nPerform sham surgeries following a similar procedure, but without transection of the medial meniscotibial ligament.\n\tNOTE: Mice were randomized to receive either DMM or sham surgery. According to the previously published literature, mice develop significant PTOA 12 weeks after the DMM surgery22,23,24.\n2. Mouse euthanasia and sample collection\nMouse euthanasia\n\t\nTwelve weeks after DMM, anesthetize mice using a ketamine (100 mg/kg)/xylazine (10 mg/kg) combination via intraperitoneal injection.",
    "Make a midline incision through the skin along the thorax and retract the rib cage to expose the heart for perfusion fixation27.\n\t\tNOTE: Refer to the Gage et al. reference for additional information on the protocol for proper rodent fixation as well as the video depiction of the proper equipment assembly and procedures27.\nSet up the perfusion apparatus according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\nEuthanize the mouse by perfusing heparinized saline through the left ventricle until blood is cleared out and the liver becomes pale. Perfuse the mouse with 10% neutral buffered formalin until complete mouse fixation is achieved.\n\t\tNOTE: A successfully perfused mouse will become stiff. The average perfusion time using the automated pump system is 5–7 min.\nSample collection and preparation\n\t\nIsolate the knees by cutting the bone at mid-femur and mid-tibia and dissect the surrounding muscle tissue.\nContinue the fixation by storing knee joints in 10% neutral buffered formalin at room temperature for 24 h, then at 4 ˚C for 6 days.\nDecalcify the bone by storing the sample in EDTA decalcification buffer for 1 week at room temperature with mild shaking28. Change the decalcification buffer solution every 3 days.\n\t\tNOTE: Decalcification buffer was prepared by dissolving 140 g of ultrapure EDTA tetrasodium in a solution of 850 mL of distilled water plus 15 mL of glacial acetic acid. The buffer was pH equilibrated to 7.6 by dropwise addition of glacial acetic acid to the solution. Upon reaching pH = 7.6, the buffer was brought to 1 L total volume with distilled water. Decalcification buffer was prepared fresh and used within 1 week of preparation.\nWash the knees with 50% ethanol, then 70% ethanol for 15 min each, then process for embedding.",
    "NOTE: Fluid transfer processing was performed by the Molecular and Histopathology Core at Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center. Consult the institution’s histology core for recommendations on optimal sample processing.\nEmbed the mouse knees in paraffin with the medial aspect of the joint facing the bottom surface of the paraffin block. Apply slight pressure to the tibial side of the joint during embedding to ensure tibial and femoral surfaces are as close to the same plane as possible.\n3. Microtome sectioning and slide selection\nMicrotome sectioning\n\t\nUse the plane adjustment knobs on the block holder of the microtome to ensure proper facing of the sample block.\nFace the paraffin block so that the distal aspect of the femur, proximal region of the tibia, and anterior and posterior horns of the medial meniscus appear in the same plane for section collection (Supplementary Figure 1A). Begin collecting sections on slides when the anterior and posterior horns of the medial meniscus begin to separate from one another.\nEnsure that the tibia, femur, and menisci appear in same plane by comparing structure sizes. The tibia and femur should be of comparable size, with both meniscal horns similar in size and shape (Supplementary Figure 1A). If a structure appears too large in comparison to its counterpart, this indicates that additional facing is needed. Importantly, confirm that the joint space remains intact.\nTake sagittal sections of the paraffin-embedded mouse knees through the medial joint compartment in 5 μm sections and collect the sections on slides. Collect approximately 30 sections per paraffin block.\nSlide selection\n\t\nSelect three representative sections 50 μm apart for each sample starting from the fifth section (i.e., slides 5, 15, and 25). Selected slides will be used for subsequent staining, OARSI scoring, and histomorphometric analysis.",
    "NOTE: From a block with 30 total sections, select slides from the beginning (slides 5–10), middle (slides 15–20), and end (slides 25–30) of the set in order to clearly represent the entire sample. Select slides from similar levels of depth between samples.\n4. Hematoxylin, Safranin Orange, and Fast Green staining\nDeparaffinize the selected slides with three changes of xylene. Hydrate the slides with two changes of 100% ethanol, two changes of 95% ethanol, and one change of 70% ethanol.\nStain the slides with hematoxylin for 7 min then wash with running water for 10 min. Stain with Fast Green for 3 min and rinse in 1.0% glacial acetic acid for 10 s. Stain with Safranin-O for 5 min and quickly rinse by dipping in 0.5% glacial acetic acid.\nRinse slides in two changes of distilled water and let air dry.\nClear slides in three changes of xylene for 5 min each then mount with xylene-based mounting media and a coverslip.\n\tNOTE: Hematoxylin serves as the nuclear stain for identifying areas of bone marrow. Safranin-O is used to stain cartilage, proteoglycans, mucin, and mast cell granules. Fast Green is used as a counterstain for bone.\n5. Slide imaging\nImage the Safranin-O and Fast Green stained slides using an available camera attached to a microscope and computer-based imaging software.\nOpen the imaging software (see Table of Materials) and arrange the knee joint region of interest (ROI) in the center of the imaging window. If using a rotational microscope slide stage, align the slide so that the tibial surface spans the width of the horizontal axis of the imaging region.",
    "Set the white balance of the camera before beginning to image a set of samples (Supplementary Figure 2). Image the joint compartment at both 4x and 10x magnification, ensuring that both the tibial and femoral articular surface and tibial subchondral bone are included within each of the image ROIs (Supplementary Figure 1A, B). Save images for each of the three selected levels to be used for OARSI scoring.\n\tNOTE: Setting the white balance of the camera will depend on the software and camera systems being used. Generally, navigate to the Camera Tab or Main Imaging Menu and scroll down to Set White Balance. Select Set White Balance and a small cursor or icon should appear (Supplementary Figure 2A). Using the cursor, select an area within the image/sample that is free of stain, such as the joint space, to set the white balance.\n6. Osteoarthritis research society international (OARSI) scoring15\nRandomize the three selected Safranin-O and Fast Green stained slides from all samples.\nPerform OARSI scoring in a blinded manner with three observers. Briefly, display one image at a time in a randomized order and allow three observers to score each image, correlating to one of the three levels selected for each sample.\n\tNOTE: Please refer to the OARSI scoring table for detailed descriptions of the grading scale15.\nCalculate the average score for each section using individual scores from each observer. Determine the average score per sample by taking the average score of the three representative sections.\n7. Histomorphometric analysis",
    "NOTE: Live images of the knee joint are viewed on a touchscreen monitor using a microscope camera, and a stylus is used to manually trace the ROIs. Built-in algorithms of the histomorphometry software quantify the specified parameters (see Protocol below) in the defined ROIs. Importantly, the same Safranin-O and Fast Green stained sections used in OARSI scoring are used for histomorphometric analysis.\nSoftware setup and measurement preparation\n\t\nTurn on microscope, camera, computer, and touchscreen monitor. Click on the Software Icon to launch the software program. Place the slide on the microscope stage for viewing.\nCenter the sample within the measurement window. Ensure that the measurement grid is set to the proper magnification to match the objective being used on the microscope (Supplementary Figure 3).\nGo to the File tab at the top of the screen and scroll down to Read Settings. Open the Settings window and select the appropriate settings file for the parameters to be measured.\nSelect the parameter to be measured from the list on the right hand side of the screen (Supplementary Figure 3). Use the stylus or mouse cursor to trace images according to steps described below in order to measure specific tissue ROIs. When completed with each measurement, Right Click to end the measurement and continue to the next parameter.\n\t\tNOTE: The list of parameters to be measured is created through a distinct preference file that is set up in consultation with the software company for the purpose of measuring the described ROIs. Please see discussion for further details regarding the complete setup.",
    "Complete all measurements and then navigate to the Summary Data tab at the bottom of the software screen (Supplementary Figure 3). Click on the screen window, hit the Insert key on the keyboard or copy and paste the data into a separate spreadsheet.\n\t\tNOTE: Perform histomorphometric analysis in a randomized and blinded manner. After completing all parameter measurements for all samples, organize the data and average the measurements from the three slides from each sample.\nMeasurements of the total, calcified, and uncalcified cartilage areas\n\tNOTE: Use a commercially available software (see Table of Materials) to perform these steps. Please see Supplementary Figure 1B,C for clarification on cartilage regions, junctions, and subchondral bone regions discussed throughout this section.\n\t\nDraw a line across the superior edge of the tibial cartilage surface where the cartilage meets the joint space. Draw a second line at the chondro-osseous junction where the calcified cartilage meets the subchondral bone (Figure 1B). Use the software Area function to automatically obtain the total cartilage area measurement.\nDraw a line along the tidemark, a naturally occurring line separating the calcified and uncalcified regions of cartilage. Draw a second line at the chondro-osseous junction where the calcified cartilage meets the subchondral bone (Figure 1B). Use the software Area function to automatically obtain the calcified cartilage area measurement.\nCalculate the uncalcified cartilage area by subtracting the calcified cartilage area from the total cartilage area (Figure 1B).\nDetermination of the chondrocyte number and phenotype\n\t\nCreate separate count functions within the settings in the histomorphometry software to distinguish matrix producing and matrix nonproducing chondrocytes (Figure 1B).\nDetermine the number of matrices producing or not producing chondrocytes by using the stylus to make a small dot over each chondrocyte expressing the specified phenotype (Figure 1B).",
    "NOTE: Count cells according to their phenotype as either matrix producing (i.e., strong Safranin-O staining) or matrix nonproducing (i.e., very faint or no Safranin-O staining).\nMeasurement of the tibial articular surface perimeter\n\t\nMeasure the absolute tibial articular surface perimeter by tracing a line across the surface of the tibial cartilage, carefully defining individual fibrillations (Figure 1C).\nDraw a second line along the tidemark to serve as an internal control for the plane of each section (Figure 1C).\nCalculate the tibial articular surface fibrillation index by dividing the tibial articular surface perimeter by the tidemark perimeter.\n\t\tNOTE: Tidemark perimeters are generally equal across samples, so the difference in the articular surface perimeters between sham and DMM was generally small whether absolute perimeter or fibrillation index were used.\nMeasurement of the subchondral bone and marrow space areas\n\t\nMeasure the subchondral marrow space area using the Area function by outlining regions in the subchondral region stained with hematoxylin only (i.e., negative for Fast Green) to determine total marrow space area within the subchondral bone. Draw lines around the perimeter of these areas to determine the total area of all marrow space within the tibial subchondral bone (Figure 2B).\nMeasure the total subchondral area using the area function by outlining the region between the chondro-osseous junction and the superior border of the growth plate, extending laterally to the regions of the anterior and posterior osteophytes (Figure 2B).\nCalculate the subchondral bone area by subtracting the subchondral bone marrow space area from the total subchondral area (Figure 2B,C).\nMeasurement of the anterior and posterior osteophyte areas\n\t\nTo measure the osteophyte area, trace the anterior and posterior osteophytes of the proximal tibia using the Area function (Figure 2B,E,F).",
    "NOTE: Osteophytes are bony projections that form between the articular cartilage and the growth plate, anterior or posterior to the subchondral region. Osteophyte areas on the anterior and posterior sides of the tibia are determined by tracing the area anterior or posterior to the subchondral bone. The junction between the osteophytes and subchondral bone is clearly delineated by a line of cells extending from the articular cartilage to the growth plate. The junction between the osteophyte and synovium is defined by a transition between bony and fibrous tissue.\nMeasurement of the synovial thickness\n\t\nMeasure the anterior femoral synovial thickness using the Area function by drawing a line from the inner insertion point of the anterior synovium on the femur towards its attachment point on the meniscus (Figure 3B).\nDraw a second line from the outer insertion of the synovium on the femur towards its attachment to the meniscus (Figure 3B).\nCalculate the synovial thickness by dividing the total synovial area by the synovial perimeter.\n8. Statistical analysis\nCollect the measured parameters and average the results from the three representative sections for each sample. Analyze the data using an unpaired Student’s t-test to compare two groups or one-way ANOVA to compare three or more groups.\nDisplay the data as mean ± standard error of mean.\n\tNOTE: Statistical significance was achieved at p ≤ 0.05.\nSubscription Required.
