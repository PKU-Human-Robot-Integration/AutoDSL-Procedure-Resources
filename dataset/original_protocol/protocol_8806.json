    "Ethics Statement: Procedures involving animal subjects were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Wayne State University.\n1. Preparation of Experimental Solution\nPrepare the dissecting solution 1 day to 1 week before the actual experiment. Use a HEPES buffer solution for retinal dissection because of its strong buffering ability at lower temperatures16. Mix all chemicals as follows (in mM): 115 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 1.0 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 28 glucose. Adjust pH to 7.4 with NaOH. Keep the solution in a refrigerator up to 1 week.\nThe recording solution is Ames’ medium, which is an artificial cerebral spinal fluid (aCSF) designed for retinal preparations17. By the day of the experiment, weigh out Ames’ powder (4.4 g for 500 ml solution) in a tube. Also, weigh out NaHCO3 (0.95 g for 500 ml solution) and mix with the Ames’ powder.\nPrepare the intracellular pipette solution for patch clamp recordings by the day of the experiment. Mix all chemicals as follows (in mM): 111 K-gluconate, 1.0 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 1.1 EGTA, 10 NaCl, 1.0 MgCl2, 5 ATP-Mg, and 1.0 GTP-Na. Adjust pH to 7.2 with KOH. Filter the pipette solution with a conventional syringe filter. Make ~500 µl aliquots and store them in a freezer or a deep freezer.\n2. Preparation for the Day of Experiment\nThe night before the experiment, place a mouse in a cage (C57BL/6J or similar background, 4 - 8 weeks old, male) in a dark space for O/N dark adaptation.\nPreparation for dissection:\n\t\nFill dissecting solution (100 - 200 ml) in a glass beaker, place it on ice, and bubble with oxygen for at least 10 min.\nStart oxygenation of the dark box for retinal preparation storage.",
    "Prepare plastic coverslips with grease rails for retinal slice preparations and place each of them in a 35 mm plastic dish.\nAttach a new razor blade to a chopper (tissue slicer).\nCut a filter membrane into two halves. This is for retinal slicing.\nAlign the dissecting tools and transfer pipettes near the dissecting microscope. The work area must be well organized so that each tool can be easily accessed in the dark.\nPreparation for patch clamp recordings:\n\t\nDissolve Ames’ powder and NaHCO3 in distilled water (Ames 4.4 g and NaHCO3 0.95g/500 ml ddH2O). Bubble the Ames’ medium with mixed oxygen (95% O2 and 5% CO2) for at least 30 min while heating to a recording temperature level (~35 °C). Adjust the pH to 7.4 with NaHCO3 while still bubbling.\nThaw the internal pipette solution during the dissection. After it is thawed, add 0.01% sulforhodamine B for intracellular staining.\n3. Retinal Dissection\nIn a dark room, euthanize the mouse using carbon dioxide and bilateral pneumothorax. After 2 - 3 min of using the carbon dioxide, the mouse will lose consciousness.\nWhen the mouse no longer responds to a tail pinch, quickly enucleate the eyes and place them in a cold dissecting solution in a plastic dish. Perform the bilateral pneumothorax to ensure the animal’s death. Quickly store the eye in the dish in the dark box. Use an infrared viewer to conduct the procedure in the dark.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, isoflurane, decapitation, or cervical dislocation can be used for euthanasia. The method of euthanasia should follow the guidelines of the National Institute of Health (NIH) and/or the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.",
    "In a dark room, adjust the dissecting microscope and infrared illumination. Under the microscope, transfer an eye from its dish into a 10 cm plastic dish with the cooled dissecting solution. Continuously bubble oxygen through tubing placed on the bottom of the plastic dish. Adjust the flow volume so it is not too low, but ensure that it is not high enough to disturb the dissection.\nCornea and lens removal:\n\t\nMake an incision on the top of the cornea with a micro-surgical knife. Holding the optic nerve at the other end of the eyeball prevents the eye from moving. Extend the cut using a pair of surgical scissors. Cut out the cornea with some sclera around it.\nGrab the lens with a fine forceps and slowly pull the lens out. If the vitreous is too sticky to remove the lens, cut the vitreous with a pair of scissors.\nOnce the eye-cup is made, gently pour cold, oxygenated dissecting solution into the eyecup with a small transfer pipette.\n\t\tNOTE: The eyeball quickly deflates after an incision is made in the cornea. It is important to maintain the shape of the eye as deforming the eye during this procedure will damage the retina and cause retinal detachment.\nIdentifying the dorsal and ventral sides of the retina:\n\tNOTE: Because of uneven distribution of the green and the ultraviolet (UV) cones18, identifying a specific retinal area is important for light response recordings.\n\t\nIdentify the line going across the retinal eye cup passing near the optic nerve head. This line passes mostly across the ventral side of the optic nerve; the side including the optic nerve is the dorsal side, while the other is ventral 19. See this landmark clearly under infrared viewers.",
    "Depending on the purpose of the experiment, make a cut on the unnecessary side. This will be useful after isolating the retina from the eye cup.\nVitreous removal:\n\t\nOptionally, incubate the eye-cup with hyaluronidase (0.5 mg/ml) for 15 min.\nRemove the vitreous with extra-fine forceps. The vitreous is mainly attached to the bottom and the outer edge of the eye-cup. Gently remove it without touching or poking the retina. As the vitreous might be tightly attached to the eyecup, remove gently to avoid retinal detachment from the eye-cup. Continue to pull until no tension is felt.\n\t\tNOTE: This step is particularly important for dissecting the mouse retina; however, it is not a problem for the retinas of other species such as the rat or salamander.\nIsolate the retina from the eye-cup. Grab the sclera and gently peel off the retina using the backside of forceps.\n\tNOTE: Whole-mount retinal preparations can be made from the isolated retina. Make three to four cuts at the edges and flatten the retina, or cut the retina into several pieces.\nTrim the retina and discard the unnecessary half of the retina (step 3.5). In the same plastic dish, cut the remaining retina into two pieces. For each piece of the retina, cut off the edges to make a retinal slab, and trim the folding edges.\nTransfer a retinal slab onto a glass plate using a large transfer pipette (~2 ml). Suck up the excess solution with a small pipette, use a piece of filter paper to flatten the slab, and then quickly place a piece of the filter membrane on top of the tissue.",
    "Using a small transfer pipette, place a drop of dissecting solution on the filter membrane. Wait ~15 sec until the solution spreads over the membrane. During this time, the retinal tissue will stick to the filter membrane.\nPour more cold dissecting solution under and around the filter. The retinal tissue with the filter membrane will float. Grab the filter membrane with a forceps and place it in the slicing chamber. Pour dissecting solution over the tissue, and store the preparation in the dark box.\n\t\tNOTE: The procedure described here is critical. It is important to perform these steps quickly to ensure that the retinal tissue sticks to the filter membrane and does not dry out.\nUsing a chopper, cut the retinal tissue into slices. Around 200 μm thickness is feasible for patch clamp studies.\nPlace a plastic coverslip with grease rails in the slicing chamber. Transfer a retinal slice on top of the grease rails on a plastic coverslip. Rotate the slice 90° so that the transverse section is visible. Press the filter membrane down onto the coverslip, then, cover the sides of the filter paper with grease.\n\t\nAfter the slice is immobilized on a plastic coverslip, grab the coverslip and transfer it to a 35 mm plastic dish. Pour cold dissecting solution onto the retinal preparation and submerge the preparation. Store each dish in the dark box, which should be continuously oxygenated.\n\t\tNOTE: The entire procedure needs to be done carefully so that the filter membrane is not deformed. Otherwise, the retinal slice easily separates from the filter membrane.\n4. Patch Clamp Recordings from Retinal Slice Preparation\nRecording preparation:\n\t\nPrime the perfusion tubes with Ames’ medium. Allow all the bubbles to pass through when filling the tubing.",
    "Make patch clamp recording pipettes with a puller. To fill a pipette with the pipette solution, dip in the backside of a pipette for 1 min until the pipette tip is backfilled. Next, fill ~1/3 of the pipette using a micro-pipette filler. Store each pipette in a moist pipette box.\nTurn on the equipment for patch clamp recordings; including the computer, amplifier, CCD camera, and microscope.\nShut off the room light. Place a retinal slice preparation onto the microscope stage chamber using an infrared viewer. After it is immobilized, begin continuous perfusion. Set the perfusion temperature at 33 to 37 °C.\nView the slice surface with the CCD camera. Focus on the target location where the target cell types reside. Select a healthy-looking cell for patch clamp recording (i.e., it should have smooth-looking surface and a good cell shape).\nPlace a recording pipette in a pipette holder. Advance the pipette to the slice preparation. When it is close to the slice preparation (~2 mm above), find the tip of the pipette with the microscope. Once the pipette tip is visible under the microscope, move the tip down towards the target cell.\nSet the amplifier. Adjust the pipette at 0 mV/0 pA (zeroing) and start a continuous electric pulse of ~5 mV at ~10 Hz. Check the pipette resistance; ideal resistance is between 5 and 10 MΩ for most retinal neurons.\nStart blowing out from the tip. Use a mouthpiece, or use a syringe, to apply positive pressure when the pipette dips into the bath solution. Continuously blow out the internal solution until the tip is on the surface of the target cell.",
    "When the positive pressure makes a small dimple on the cell surface, advance the tip slightly and stop blowing out. Check the pipette resistance, which should increase. If it is continuously increasing, leave it and monitor the resistance until it reaches >1 GΩ (gigaseal). If the resistance does not spontaneously increase, gently apply negative pressure until it becomes a gigaseal.\nAfter the gigaseal is achieved, change the holding potential to -70 mV. Then, intermittently apply negative pressure to rupture the membrane inside the pipette tip. When the whole-cell configuration is made, the pipette resistance can be between 500 MΩ and 1 GΩ, and the capacitive current is seen. Sometimes spontaneous postsynaptic currents can be observed.\nRecord the I-V relationship from -80 to +40 mV. Different types of voltage-gated channels are activated depending on the cell type.\nRecord light-evoked synaptic currents or voltages.\nSubscription Required.
