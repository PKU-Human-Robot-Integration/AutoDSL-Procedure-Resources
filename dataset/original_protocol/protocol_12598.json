    "1. DNA extraction\nPrepare EDTA/Nuclei Lysis Buffer (EDTA/NLS) with the ratio of 500 µL of NLS and 120 µL of EDTA per sample. Scale-up for multiple samples. Chill the mixture on ice.\n\tNOTE: The solution will turn cloudy in 2-5 min when chilled depending on the volume.\nHomogenize the mosquito sample using a mechanical homogenizer for 10-15 s in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube filled with 600 µL of chilled EDTA/NLS; mix thoroughly.\nAdd 17.5 µL of 20 mg/mL of Proteinase K to the tube and mix thoroughly.\nIncubate overnight at 55 °C. Alternately, incubate the sample at 55 °C for 3 h with shaking and vortex the sample every 1 h.\nAdd 200 µL of Protein Precipitation Solution to the room temperature sample and vortex vigorously for 20 s.\nChill the sample for 5 min on ice.\nCentrifuge the sample to pellet proteins at 15,890 RCF for 4 min.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant which contains the DNA and transfer it to a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing 600 µL of isopropanol.\nGently mix the solution by inverting the tube 5-10 times. Centrifuge for 1 min at 15,890 RCF. Carefully decant the supernatant while preserving the DNA pellet.\nAdd 600 µL of room-temperature 70% ethanol. Wash the pelleted DNA by gently inverting the tube.\nCentrifuge for 1 min at 15,890 RCF. Carefully remove the supernatant by aspiration using a glass pipette tip.\nInvert the tube onto clean absorbent paper and air-dry the pellet for 10-15 min.\nResuspend the DNA with PCR-grade water. Use 20 µL per individual mosquito sample or 100 µL for 10 pooled mosquitoes.\n\t​NOTE: DNA extraction methods for mosquito samples using a commercially-available kit (see Table of Materials) are adapted from the manufacturer's Isolating Genomic DNA from Tissue Culture Cells and Animal Tissue protocol.",
    "2. ddPCR reactions and droplet generation preparation\nQuantify DNA using a fluorometer.\n\tNOTE: For the drop-off assay, it is recommended to use a range of 3,000-30,000 haploid genome copies per reaction, which is designed to detect NHEJ events with a HEX-labeling probe that binds to a WT sequence of the targeted cut site and will not anneal (drop-off) if there is a deletion or insertion at the target site, indicating the presence of an NHEJ variant.\nCalculate the copy number using the haploid genome weight and concentration of DNA in the extract. This is done by multiplying the concentration of the extracted DNA by the volume used to obtain the total DNA mass, then dividing it by the haploid genome weight. Ensure that the volume added is between 1-10 µL. Dilute as necessary to be in the recommended haploid genome copy range.\n\tNOTE: One Anopheles gambiae haploid genome is estimated to be 0.27 pg per adult mosquito10.\nDesign primers and probes. Design forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers with a Primer Melting Temperature (Tm) in the range of 55-60 °C that flank the 5'- and 3'-ends of the gRNA target site producing an amplicon of 150-400 bp.\n\t\nHEX (Hexachloro-fluorescein)-labeled probe for NHEJ detection: Design an oligonucleotide of ~15-20 bp in length complementary to the target site and add the HEX-probe to the 5'-end and BHQ1 (BLack Hole Quencher 1) to the 3' end. The Tm of the hydrolysis probe should be 3-10 °C higher than the Tm of the primers.",
    "FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein)-labeled probe for reference WT: Design an oligonucleotide ~15-20 bp in length complementary to a conserved genome site distant (about 25 bp) from the target site and add the FAM-probe to the 5'-end and BHQ1 to the 3' end. The Tm of the hydrolysis probe should be 3-10 °C higher than the Tm of the primers.\n3. PCR reaction preparation\nPrepare 25 µL of the ddPCR Sample Mix with the following components: ddPCR supermix for probes (no UTP): 12.5 µL, forward and reverse primers (10 µM): 1 µL each, HEX/FAM probes (10 µM): 0.625 µL each, DNA: 1-5 µL (3,750-37,500 haploid genome copies) and water: up to 25 µL.\nThoroughly mix the reactions by vortexing or reflux pipetting (up and down) (20x).\n\tNOTE: If the reactions are in a 96-well plate, pipette the entire volume up and down 20 times rather than vortexing to avoid bubble formation.\nBriefly centrifuge the samples to settle the mixture at the bottom of the tube or well.\n\t​NOTE: Ensure the reactions are at room temperature for the droplet generation. Prepare 1x of ddPCR mix for extra/unused wells in each cartridge (each cartridge has 8 wells).\n4. Droplet generation\nUsing a 50 µL multichannel pipette, load 20 µL of the ddPCR sample mix into the middle row of the cartridge (Figure 1A, top).\nLoad 70 µL of the oil into the bottom row. Load 20 µL of 1x ddPCR supermix into unused wells.\n\tNOTE: Do not introduce bubbles.\nPlace the gasket touching only the edges, avoiding the center concaved area (Figure 1B).\nPlace the plate securely in the droplet generator and close the cover to start the run.\nUsing the multichannel pipette, transfer 40 µL of the emersion mix from the top row of the cartridge (Figure 1A, bottom) into the 96-well plate.",
    "Draw liquid sample for 3-5 s at a 45-30° angle. Expel the mixture slowly for over 3 s at a 45° angle into the side of the well, allowing it to drip down the side. It is okay to go to the second stop (complete expulsion) of the pipette to expel all the liquid.\nUsing foil heat seals, seal the plates for 5 s at 180 °C.\n5. PCR\nPlace the sealed plate into the thermocycler (Figure 1C) and set the recommended PCR conditions if following the NHEJ Drop-Off guidelines as follows:\n\t\nInitial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min.\nSet 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s to denature, 55 °C for 1 min to anneal, and 60 °C for 2 min to extend.\nHold at 98 °C for 10 min.\nHold at 4 °C.\n\t\t​NOTE: The annealing temperature for specific primers and probe sets may be optimized using a thermal gradient. Use a ramp rate of 2 °C/s for all the steps. PCR conditions should be adjusted depending on each experimental design and set-up.\n6. Droplet reading\nPlace the plate securely in the droplet reader with well A-1 at the top left (smoothed corner, the other three are edged) (Figure 1D).\nSet up the plate in the program: Designating FAM as the known reference channel and HEX as the unknown one (Figure 2A).\nRun the Droplet reading experiment as direct quantification. After the run finishes, change the Experiment type to Drop-Off (DOF) for the analysis (Figure 2A).\n7. Analysis",
    "Designate the correct experimental parameters (Figure 2A): Sample Information, SuperMix, Target Name (WT or NHEJ), Target Type (Ref or Unknown), Signal Ch1 (HEX or FAM), Signal Ch2 (HEX or FAM), and manually set the threshold for droplet count (recommend above 10,000 for reliable results). The software will perform most of the analysis with the designated parameter.\nCheck the droplet count in the Droplet tab; ensure that all are above 10,000 (Figure 2B).\nCheck 1 D amplitude for efficient signal separation from negatives.\nIn the Plate Editor, highlight the entire plate and set the Experiment Type to Drop off.\nSet the WT target as a Reference, designating channel one for FAM and channel two for HEX.\nSet NHEJ target as unknown, designating channel one for FAM and channel two as none.\nIn the 2D amplitude tab, set the Cluster Thresholds with the graph tools for each sample. Consider the tail associated with the WT cluster; this is normal for NHEJ assays (Figure 3A).\n\tNOTE: Under the Ratio tab, click on the Gear Icon from the top-right of the graph. Select the Fractional Abundance. The graph will now plot a point corresponding to the percentage of NHEJ events (Figure 3B)."
