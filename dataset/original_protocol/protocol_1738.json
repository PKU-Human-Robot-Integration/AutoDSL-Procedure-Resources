    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nStep A: Preparation of the lysis buffer (LB buffer)\nTiming: 30 min\nImportant: LB buffer should be prepared freshly right before fecal protein solubilization (step B; see below). Store LB buffer on ice throughout the solubilization procedure. LB buffer is not stable and cannot be stored.\nThe kit is designed to yield 100 mL of ready-to-use LB buffer. If less than 100 mL are needed, the required volumes can be easily adapted (500 μL of LB buffer are needed per sample to be lysed).\nPrepare 100 mL LB-PM buffer (kit component 4).\nRemove 1 mL from the 100 mL LB-PM buffer and use this volume to resuspend 1 aliquot of the enzyme mix (kit component 5) then transfer it back to the LB-PM buffer. In case less than 100 mL are needed to lyse your batch of samples, adapt the volume of the enzyme solution accordingly (example: For 20 mL of LB buffer, resuspend enzyme mix in 1 mL and add only 200 μL of this suspension to 20 mL of LB-PM buffer).\nRemove 1 mL of the enzyme mix-supplemented LB-PM buffer and use this volume to resuspend 1 tablet of EDTA-free Protease inhibitor then transfer it back to the 100 mL of enzyme mix-supplemented LB-PM buffer. In case less than 100 mL are needed to lyse your batch of samples, adapt the volume of the protease inhibitor solution accordingly (example: For 20 mL of LB buffer, resuspend protease inhibitor tablet in 1 mL and add only 200 μL of this suspension to 20 mL of the enzyme-supplemented LB-PM buffer).\nStore LB buffer on ice until further use (see step 2).\nStep B: Solubilization of glycan-degrading enzymes from mouse and human fecal samples\nTiming: 1–2 h (depending on the amount of processed samples)",
    "This step describes the solubilization of glycan-degrading enzymes present in mouse or human fecal samples. Solubilized enzymes, as obtained by the end of step 2, can be either (1) subjected to immediate activity detection or (2) be stored at −20°C.\nFor enzyme detection in mouse fecal samples, start with step 6a. For enzyme detection in human fecal samples, start with step 6b. (See Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]). All subsequent procedures apply for both mouse and human fecal samples.\nPreparation of mouse fecal samples: Transfer 1 mouse fecal pellet into a sonication device-compatible 1.5 mL tube and keep stored on ice or at −20°C until lysis.\nNote: If needed, more than one fecal pellet can be used for enzyme solubilization. Approximately 10 mg of feces is usually sufficient for detection of all 5 enzymes described in this protocol. As enzyme activity will be normalized on the protein content only, determination of the weight of the fecal samples is not necessary.\nPreparation of human fecal samples: Fecal samples from human donors can either be prepared right after donation or, more conveniently, stored at −20°C until preparation. Do not supplement the fecal matter with any additives, such as preservation buffers, glycerol, etc. On the day of sample preparation, remove a small portion of frozen (or freshly donated) human feces (approximately 20–100 mg) and transfer the piece of feces into a sonication device-compatible 1.5 mL tube and store on ice. Remaining feces can be used for other readouts that are compatible with the storage conditions.\nNote: We do not recommend comparing freshly donated fecal samples with frozen fecal samples.\nAdd 500 μL of ice-cold LB buffer to the fecal sample, irrespective of the weight.\nHomogenize the feces in the LB buffer.\nTip: Use a pipette tip or an inoculation loop to break up large clumps.",
    "Vortex sample for 10 s.\nPerform pulsed sonication of the samples at the highest available frequency for 15 s at a time, pausing for at least 10 s between every sonication step. Apply a total sonication time of 45 s.\nCritical: Keep samples on ice during sonication and between sonication steps!\nNote: All types of sonication devices work for this purpose.\nCentrifuge the sonicated samples for 10 min at 10,000 × g and 4°C.\nTransfer 350 μL of the supernatant into a new 1.5 mL tube.\nCritical: Do not touch the pellet during supernatant removal to avoid contamination of the clear supernatant with solid, unsolubilized material.\nPause point: Removed supernatants can be stored at −20°C. If immediate activity detection is preferred, store samples on wet ice.\nStep C: Detection of substrate turnover\nTiming: 4–6 h\nAfter determination of the protein concentrations in the supernatants (step 15, see below) obtained from step B, protein amounts should be equalized among all samples to be detected. We recommend using the Pierce 660nm Protein Assay Reagent as it works well with the detergent-containing LB buffer. DB buffer and substrates are added afterward, followed by immediate start of absorption detection (step 20, see below).\nWhen frozen supernatant samples are used, thaw samples on ice.\nWhile samples are thawing, create a standard curve using 4-nitrophenol (kit component 2):\nThaw 1 aliquot of the 4-nitrophenol standard (kit component 2) and perform serial 1:2 dilutions down to ≈ 1 μM.\nTip: The detection limit of the highest and lowest concentrations of the 4-nitrophenol standards depends on the spectrophotometer being used. Thus, we recommend to detect one complete dilution series from 100 μM down to a 3-digit nanomolar range.",
    "See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] for an example standard curve. In this example, we detected 4-nitrophenol concentrations ranging from 4.8 μM to 2.5 mM.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1327-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Primary data output of an example standard curve\nStandard curve displaying 4-nitrophenol concentrations in μM and the corresponding absorption at 405 nm in mAU. Only detectable concentrations of 4-nitrophenol are shown. Concentrations exceeding the detection range (OD405 > 4.2, in our case) and concentrations below detection limit are not considered for creating the standard curve. Please note that we use the unit “OD405 nm” for depicting primary data in the figures, while we use “AU” (absorbance units) for subsequent mathematical transformations of the detected optical densities (OD) or absorption (A) at 405 nm.\nTip: Despite only minor differences between standard curves detected on different days or settings, we recommend running a standard curve with every sample detection.\nDetect fecal protein concentrations in the supernatants using any commercially available protein concentration detection kit. We recommend the Pierce 660nm Protein Assay Reagent.\nAttention: Always use a blank of LB buffer only and subtract the detected absorption of the blank from the sample absorption.\nCalculate the volume needed from each sample to achieve the required fecal protein amounts for the detection of each of the 5 enzymes.\nAttention: The required protein amounts to be used are specific for each of the 5 enzymes (Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1327_4.csv\nNote: Detection of sulfatase requires relatively high amounts of protein. In case protein concentration in a given sample is low, use the maximum volume possible (75 μL). Be sure to input the protein amount that was actually used for activity calculation (step D).",
    "Add DB buffer into the respective wells of a 96-well plate to obtain a final volume of 150 μL per well. We recommend using flat-bottom transparent plates. See Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5] for a summary of the pipetting scheme.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1327_5.csv\nTransfer the required volumes of the fecal protein solutions into the respective wells.\nAdd the substrate solutions (kit component 1) to the wells.\nAttention: The required substrate solution volumes to be used are specific for each of the 5 enzymes (Table 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1327_6.csv\nDetect absorption at 405 nm for 2–4 h at 37°C with 1 to 2 min detection intervals and a shaking step before each detection.\nWe have verified the optimal concentrations for each substrate as demonstrated in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1327-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Evaluation of the optimal substrate concentrations for reliable CAZyme activity detection in mouse and human fecal samples",
    "Mouse and human fecal sample were prepared as described in step B. For detection of substrate turnover, 1 μg of total fecal protein was used for activity detection of α-galactosidase and β-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, 5 μg for detection of β-glucosidase and α-fucosidase, and 25 μg for detection of sulfatase. Activities were detected from fecal samples obtained from 3 mice and 3 humans. Mice were housed under SPF conditions and fed a standard maintenance chow and fecal samples were stored at −20°C until preparation. Human samples were obtained from healthy volunteer stool donors and stool was stored at −80°C until preparation. For each individual, activities of all 5 enzymes were determined with varying substrate concentrations. Activities for α-galactosidase, β-glucosidase, α-fucosidase, and sulfatase were determined for substrate concentrations ranging from 1.25 mM to 40 mM, while activities for β-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase were determined for substrate concentrations ranging from 0.31 mM to 10 mM, due to lower concentration of the substrate stock (see Before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]). For each individual, Vmax of every enzyme was determined by plotting substrate turnover velocity (Vn) against substrate concentration followed by standard Michaelis-Menten regression. Next, all Vn of each individual and tested enzyme were normalized on Vmax of the respective individual and tested enzyme (% Vmax). The figure depicts these normalized values, separated for human (n = 3) and mouse (n = 3) fecal donors. Using these curves, we determined the optimal substrate concentrations for the detection of all 5 tested enzymes in mouse and human samples separately. As seen in the figure, there was no apparent difference between samples of mouse and human origin, suggesting that determined optimal substrate concentrations for each enzyme are independent from the origin of the samples.",
    "Note that α-fucosidase activities are decreasing with substrate concentrations exceeding a threshold of approximately 15 mM N-FP, while activities of sulfatase are largely independent of the substrate concentration within the tested substrate concentration range.",
    "Note: See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for example substrate turnover curves as obtained by following the protocol above. According to these curves, we recommend the detection times listed in Table 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl7]).
