Suspension cells can be collected and washed by centrifugation.\nAspirate and discard the medium from the culture dish.\nRinse HeLa cells with 10 mL of pre-chilled 1 × PBS buffer three times.\nFix cells with 10 mL freshly prepared 1% (w/v) formaldehyde solution by shaking the dish on a platform rotator at low speed at room temperature (20°C–22°C) for 10 min.\nQuench the fixation by adding 500 μL of 2.5 M glycine solution and shaking the dish on an orbital shaker at low speed at room temperature (20°C–22°C) for 10 min.\nDiscard the medium from the dish and rinse cells with 10 mL of pre-chilled 1 × PBS buffer three times.\nScrape off the cells from the culture dish and transfer the cell suspension to a new 50 mL centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 1,200 g for 10 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.

    "Note: A high percentage of PCR duplicates in a sequencing dataset can indicate poor sequencing quality or unsuccessful library construction. The low percentage of PCR duplicates (∼20%) in the case of PTBP1 CRIC-seq libraries suggests that the library construction was successful. Chimeric ratio measurement is another parameter to assess library quality. For the PTBP1 CRIC-seq library, we observed a chimeric read ratio of approximately 7%, with 90% of the chimeric reads being intra-molecular, consistent with our expectations. Additionally, we evaluated the reproducibility of the CRIC-seq library across biological replicates by calculating their Pearson correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient was greater than 0.9, indicating high reproducibility between the replicates.\nIdentify background contacts during CRIC-seq library construction:\nMerge the chimeric reads from IgG IP (+pCp) and RBP IP (−pCp) and save them as a SAM format file named “background_Chimeric.sam”.\nExtract the coordinates of the pairwise junction sites for the background chimeric reads and save them to a BEDPE format file named “background_Chimeric_junction.bedpair”.\nCluster the chimeric reads in the background group if their junction sites are in a pairwise 10-nt genomic window.\n>cat IgG_(+pCp)_CRIC_Chimeric.sam RBP_(-pCp)_CRIC_Chimeric.sam > background_Chimeric.sam\n>perl from_sam_to_bedOfJunctionPair.pl background_Chimeric.sam > background_Chimeric_junction.bedpair\n>perl merge_IgG_pCp_minus_to_background.pl background_Chimeric_junction.bedpair\nCalculate the chimeric read counts for RBP IP (+pCp) and background CRIC-seq:\nExtract the coordinates of pairwise junction sites from RBP IP (+pCp) CRIC-seq chimeric reads and store them in a BEDPE format file named \"RBP_(+pCp)_Chimeric_junction.bedpair\".\nCollect the read counts for RBP IP (+pCp) CRIC-seq chimeric reads and background chimeric reads residing in background clusters and save them as files named \"RBP_(+pCp)_Chimeric.in_background_cluster.list\" and \"background_Chimeric.in_background_cluster.list\".\n> perl from_sam_to_bedOfJunctionPair.pl RBP_(+pCp)_CRIC_Chimeric.sam > RBP_(+pCp)_Chimeric_junction.bedpair\n>bedtools pairtopair -a background.raw_cluster.bed -b RBP_(+pCp)_Chimeric_junction.bedpair -is -rdn > RBP_(+pCp)_Chimeric.in_background_cluster.list\n>bedtools pairtopair -a background.raw_cluster.bed -b background_Chimeric_junction.bedpair -is -rdn > background_ Chimeric.in_ background_cluster.list\nRemove background from RBP IP (+pCp) CRIC-seq libraries:",
