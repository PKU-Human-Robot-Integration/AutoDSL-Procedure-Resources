    "All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines for animal experiments from the National Institute of Genetics (NIG), and all procedures were approved by the NIG Committee for Animal Care and Use (approval no. 26-9).\n1. Animals\nSelective breeding\nCreate wild-derived heterogeneous stock (WHS)6 mice by crossing 8 inbred strains (MSM, HMI, BLG2, PGN2, KJR, CHD, NJL, and BFM/2) while avoiding any inbreeding (mating between siblings or cousins)7. Conduct a selective breeding, starting in the third generation (G3), by selecting mice that display longer “contact time” (selected group, 16 families of mating pairs) according to the active tameness test (see step 3.1).\nGenerate the non-selected control group (also 16 families of mating pairs) via random mating from G3 onward. For a representative experiment, use mice obtained from selected (S1) and non-selected (C1) groups of WHS mice to show the pattern of both active and passive tameness using the three tameness tests (see step 3.1 - 3.3). For the experiments, use 10 G15 mice per group (S1 and C1).\nRepresentative subject animals\nWean all mice from their parents at 3 weeks of age and house them in same-sex groups with littermates, using standard-size plastic cages containing wood chips, until the test. Maintain all animals at an NIG animal facility under a 12/12 h light/dark cycle (lights on from 06:00 to 18:00) and a constant temperature (23 ± 2 °C).\nEnsure that food and water are available ad libitum. Test the mice at 6 weeks of age during the light period to analyze their interactions with humans during the part of the day when humans are typically active.\nHandling protocol",
    "Use large tweezers covered with silicon tubes to transfer the mice to new cages by picking them up gently by their tails. Use the tweezers to separate them from their parents at weaning and move them during the experiments. None of the mice should receive handling before the tameness tests.\nTransfer the mice to an experimental room just before the tameness tests.\nKeep the male mice separated from one another after the test, to avoid inter-male aggression in WHS mice.\n2. Equipment\nUse an open-field apparatus (400 x 400 x 400 mm, grayish polyvinylchloride).\nIlluminate the open field using a clip light with a neutral white bulb (100 lux) fixed at a height of 450 mm above the open field (Figure 1).\nRecord all behaviors using a commercially available compact digital camera fixed at 850 mm above the open field using a tripod (Figure 1).\nWear cloth gloves under latex gloves to protect the hands from being bitten at during the passive tameness test (a rare reaction).\nMeasure the test period using a stopwatch.\n3. Tests\nNote: The first two tests (active tameness and passive tameness) were conducted for 1 min each, and the stay-on-hand test was conducted for less than 1 min. All three tests were conducted in the open-field apparatus and recorded using a digital camera. Iodophore disinfection procedure should be performed on all apparats before any behavior studies.\nProcedures for active tameness test\nTurn on the digital camera and start recording.\nPick up a mouse gently by the tail using a pair of large tweezers (see step 1.3.1) and transfer it from the home cage to the center of the open-field apparatus.\nStart the stopwatch.\nPlace the left hand on the lower left corner of the apparatus.",
    "Keep the palm facing up and move the fingers slowly and steadily to ensure that the mouse connects the hand to a human. The average time to move all four fingers from the little finger to the index finger should be approximately 0.5 s, with a continuously repeated movement cycle.\nMove the hand toward the mouse slowly, at an average speed of about 13 cm/s, stopping at 10 cm from the side of the mouse’s body.\nMaintain the same distance if the mouse attempts to move away. If the mouse approaches, keep the hand in the same position and continue to move the fingers slightly. If the mouse attempts to climb up the arm, return it to the field using the free hand.\nConclude the test after 1 min, withdraw the hand, and proceed to the passive tameness test.\nProcedures for passive tameness test\nFollow the same steps as for the active tameness test, but instead of stopping 10 cm away from the mouse’s body, slowly touch the mouse with the fingertips.\nLeave the fingers in the same position, contacting the mouse, until the mouse moves away. When the mouse attempts to break contact, follow it, moving at an average speed of about 23 cm/s, and reinitiate the touch.\nConclude the test after 1 min. Restart the stopwatch immediately to begin the stay-on-hand test.\nProcedures for stay-on-hand test\nLift the mouse by the tail using a pair of large tweezers and place it gently on the left palm. Keep the hand close to the floor of the open-field apparatus.\nStroke the mouse gently at an average speed of 0.5 s/stroke using the left thumb until it leaves the hand.\nRepeat steps 3.3.1 - 3.3.2 3x.\nAfter the third trial, stop the video recording; all tameness tests are now concluded.",
    "Post-experimental procedures\nWeigh the mouse and count the number of feces and urine left in the open field.\nMark the mouse individually via an ear punch.\nWipe the apparatus and experimenter gloves with a paper towel soaked in 0.2% Iodophor sanitizer.\nClean the apparatus with a dry paper towel.\n4. Behavioral analyses\nNote: Video recordings were scored using tanaMove version 0.01 (Windows 7), event-recording software for behavioral analyses (Figure 2). The software is freely available (Supplemental Materials 1) and from our website (http://www.mgrl-lab.jp/MGRL_software.html). An individual who was blind to the test conditions scored all footage. The duration of all behavioral indices was measured in 0.1-s increments. During the scoring, the observer pressed the appropriate letter on the keyboard (see step 4.1) upon noting a given behavior.\nAssignment of keys for video analysis\nAssign keys for each behavior index. Using appropriate keys for each behavioral index is critical to summarize the data automatically in step 4.3.\n\t\tNote: The assignments used in this study are shown in Figure 3.\nVideo analysis\nAnalyze each video recording 3x for different behavioral indices (Figure 3B). Self-grooming behavior was not scored. Make sure the built-in speaker of the computer is switched on in order to hear the timer sound in the video.\nLaunch tanaMove.\nDrag and drop the video file to be analyzed into the window of tanaMove. Confirm that the file is loaded and that the path and name of the outputted CSV file in the Data File [.csv] box is correct.\nClick the Ready button. This activates a new window to enter the assigned keys.\nClick the Play button to start the video file. Click the Stop button to pause the video file.",
    "Press key A when the mouse is observed “heading” toward or approaching the hand, including standing to sniff. Press key R when the mouse is observed “locomoting” without heading toward the hand during the active tameness test.\nPress key W for at least 0.3 s (at least three intervals in the window) when the timer sound is heard at 60 s.\nInitiate the analysis of the passive tameness test after the left hand enters the video. Press key A when the mouse is observed heading toward or approaching the hand and key R when the mouse is observed traveling without heading toward the hand during the passive tameness test.\nPress key W for at least 0.3 s (at least three intervals in the window) when the timer sound is heard at 60 s.\nPress key T when the mouse is observed “staying” on the hand in the stay-on-hand test.\nAfter the stay-on-hand test, click the Stop button to stop the video observation.\nClick the Back button and type a new file name for the CSV data output.\nClick the Ready button to activate a new window to enter the assigned keys.\nClick the Play button to restart the video footage and initiate the observation of the active tameness test.\nPress key T when the mouse is observed “contacting” the human, which includes all voluntary contacting behavior but not accidental contacts, such as landing on a palm after jumping, during the active tameness test.\nPress key W for at least 0.3 s (at least three intervals in the window) when the timer sound is heard at 60 s.\nPress key T when the mouse allows the experimenter to touch its body during the passive tameness test.",
    "Press key W for at least 0.3 s (at least three intervals in the window) when the timer sound is heard at 60 s.\nClick the Stop button to stop the video.\nClick the Back button and type a new file name for the CSV data output.\nClick the Ready button to activate a new window to enter the assigned keys.\nClick the Play button to restart the video footage and initiate the observation of the active tameness test.\nPress key J when the mouse is observed “jumping” during the active tameness test.\nPress key W for at least 0.3 s (at least three intervals in the window) when the timer sound is heard at 60 s. Then start the observation of the passive tameness test.\nPress key J when the mouse is observed “jumping” during the passive tameness test.\nClick the Stop button to stop the video observation when the timer sound is heard at 60 s.\nClick the Back button and type a new file name for the CSV data output.\nSummarize the data\nSave all the raw data files (CSV) in the same folder with the Supplementary 2.xlsm file (Supplemental Materials 2).\nOpen the Supplementary 2.xlsm file and click the Summarize button.\nSave the results as a separate file and use it for further analysis of the tameness behavior.\nSubscription Required.
