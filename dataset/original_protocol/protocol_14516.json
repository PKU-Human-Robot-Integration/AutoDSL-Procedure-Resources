    "All procedures were approved by the ethics committee of the medical association of the State Rhineland-Palatinate and performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\n1. Atomizer4\nRemove the set from package. Inspect the product to ensure there is no damage.\n\tNOTE: The device is intended for one-time use. Please refer to the instructions for use for further information about storage and supply (see Materials and Equipment Table).\n2. General Preparation of the Patient\nAdminister premedication, e.g. Lorazepam 1 - 2.5 mg the evening before and/or 2 - 4 mg 1 - 2 h before the intervention (with attention to contraindications).\nEstablish monitoring parameters such as pulse oximetry (SpO2), electrocardiography (ECG) and non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP).\n\tNOTE: Monitor patient sedation using standards such as Ramsay Sedation Scale and Bispectral Index monitoring. Close monitoring of the level of sedation can help prevent potential complications such as respiratory depression.\nSecure a peripheral intravenous access.\n3. Topical Anesthesia of the Upper Airway\nApply 1 mL mixture of lidocaine 2% with phenylephrine 0.25% to each nostril.\nApply lidocaine 10% spray twice directly onto the mucosa of the oropharynx, spraying from the tip to the back of the tongue. Ask the patient to gargle the lidocaine in the mouth for as long as possible.\n\tNOTE: Anesthesia of the supraglottic airway can be performed alternatively using cotton-tipped swabs or nasopharyngeal airways, drops, gel, swish and gargling, aspirating and spraying local anesthetics.\n4. Analgo-sedation\nStart analgo-sedation using i.v. medication, e.g. initial sufentanil bolus (< 60 kg: 5 µg; > 60 kg: 10 µg; > 100 kg: 15 µg).\n\tNOTE: Dose drug-induced sedation at the lowest level possible in order to prevent apnea or airway constriction.",
    "Give an extra sufentanil i.v. bolus, e.g. 5 µg, as 'rescue' treatment until a Ramsay Sedation Score of 2 (cooperative, oriented, tranquil) is achieved.\n5. Equipment Preparation\nAssemble and check the flexible intubation endoscope according to institutional standards.\nConnect the oxygen tube of the atomizer to the oxygen flow meter directly.\nCaution! Oxygen flow meters with humidifier bottles must not be used.\nAttach the connecting tube to the Luer on the working channel of the endoscope. Set the oxygen flow rate to 10 L/min, as recommended in the instruction manual.\nConnect a 1 mL syringe containing the lidocaine 2% solution to the three-way sidearm fitting.\n\tNOTE: Lidocaine 2% with its favorable efficacy profile is a suitable anesthetic.\n6. Atomizer Technique\nClose the flow-control opening using a finger. Rapidly inject the medication. Immediately release the flow-control opening.\n\tNOTE: A syringe must be connected to the three-way sidearm fitting to obtain a continuous low oxygen flow through the working channel.\nWhile advancing the flexible endoscope in the airway, inject the local anesthetic using the atomizer at the following sites: inside nostril, on posterior nares; epiglottis; glottis; and vocal cords.\nRepeat these steps as often as required while advancing the endoscope (\"spray-as-you-go\"). Before passing through the vocal cords, wait for 2 min to allow sufficient drug effect at the site.\n\tNOTE: Monitor sedation level of patient and top up sedation using i.v. medication (e.g. sufentanil 5 µg), as needed.\n7. Flexible Endoscopic Intubation\nAdvance the endoscope carefully through the glottis into the trachea and position the tip of the endoscope just above the carina. Railroad a suitable sized, cuffed and lubricated flexible endotracheal tube over the endoscope into the trachea under rotation.\n\tNOTE: Avoid accidental advancement of the endoscope tip into a main stem bronchus.",
    "Confirm placement of the endotracheal tube in the trachea just above the carina by visual control via the endoscope. Remove the endoscope, leaving the endotracheal tube in place.\nConfirm the endotracheal position of the tube by measuring end tidal CO2 using capnography in the spontaneously breathing patient.\nInduce general anesthesia, e.g. intravenous Propofol 2 mg/kg/body weight. Start ventilating the patients according to current standards.\nNOTE: The Enk Atomizer set is currently not available from Cook Medical.\nSubscription Required.
