    "The study was approved by the local ethical committee (Ethikkommission Nordwest- und Zentralschweiz, Basel, Switzerland), and written informed consent was obtained from the participants before starting the study.\n1. Test Preparation and Participant Instruction\nArm crank ergometer\nTurn the power on the rotation speed-dependent arm crank ergometer before opening the software.\nChoose the test protocol for the 3 min, all-out ergometer test.\n\t\t\nInsert a new protocol with a 120 s warmup, 180 s of test duration, and a 720 s cooldown period. Choose this test protocol and open a new participant sheet.\nFor every new test, determine the participant's body mass beforehand.\nSet the relative torque factor to 0.2 for able-bodied and paraplegic individuals (e.g., for a 100-kg participant with a relative torque factor of 0.2, a torque of 20 Nm results)12.\n\t\t\nApply a lower torque factor for tetraplegic participants depending on the lesion level of the spinal cord injury; two or more familiarization trials are needed to determine the optimal relative torque factor for the relevant participant.\nPerform a familiarization trial in the same manner as described in section 2. If no peak appears after printing the data from the familiarization trial, or if the participant was not able to crank for the whole 3 min, perform a second familiarization trial with a lower torque factor. Give participants a rest of at least two days between each trial.\nExercise test settings\nAdjust the height of the arm crank and record it to replicate identical test settings in the next test session. Adjust and record the distance between the arm crank ergometer and the participant.",
    "To determine the height, measure the distance between the floor and the fixation of the crank. To record the distance between the crank and the participant, measure and record the distance between the wall and the chair fixation. Adjust the arm crank axis to a height horizontal to the shoulder joint.\nRecord either the distance between the wall fixation and the chair or the distance between the ergometer and the chair fixation. Adjust the chair settings according to whether the participant is a) able-bodied, b) paraplegic ,or c) tetraplegic.\n\t\t\nIf the participant is able-bodied, have the participant sit in the chair provided by the distributor.\nIf the participant is paraplegic and needs to sit in their own wheelchair, use a fixation set to fix the wheelchair to the arm crank ergometer. If the participant does not need their own wheelchair, have the participant sit in the chair provided by the distributor.\nIf the participant is tetraplegic, fix their upper body to the chair provided by the distributor or to their own wheelchair and possibly fix their hands to the pedals. To fix the upper body, use a strap with hook-and-loop fastener. For hand fixation, use a wristband in tetraplegic patients.\nAdditional measurements\nMake sure that the lactate system solution is refilled before using the lactate analyzer. Insert a new chip sensor every six months. Use the quality control solution (12 mM) every day and the 3 mM quality control solution every two weeks.\n\t\t\nPut the 12 mM quality control solution into the \"STD 1\" slot every morning.\nTo further enhance the quality, add 3 mM quality control solutions into gap \"1\" and \"2\" and run a measurement by pressing \"start\" every two weeks. The measurement should result in a range between 2.96 and 3.10 mM.",
    "To determine the whole-blood lactate concentration before and after the 3 min, all-out arm crank ergometer test, obtain a baseline lactate concentration. Disinfect the earlobe with a disinfectant before drawing a blood sample from the earlobe using a 10 µL capillary. Use a lancet to get the whole blood sample.\n\t\t\nWhen the capillary is completely full of blood, put it into the hemolysis cup.\n\t\t\tNOTE: These cups are commercially available and prefilled with a hemolyzing solution. Shake the solution until the blood is completely mixed before putting it into the tray of the lactate analyzer.\nRun a calibration before analyzing the lactate concentration. Place the quality control cup into the lactate analyzer (see step 1.3.1.1.). Ensure that the calibration results in a 12-mM lactate concentration; otherwise, replace the chip sensor.\nPlace the samples into the numbered slots, starting with \"1\" for the sample that was taken first.\n\t\t\tNOTE: After the calibration is completed, the samples are measured automatically by the chip sensor system.\nTo determine the heartrate, place a heartrate belt around the chest of the participant and fix the heartrate monitor to the arm crank ergometer. Start the measurement by pressing on the red start button on the monitor. If no heartrate is displayed on the watch, wet the heartrate belt with water to ensure a good recording of the heartrate.\nTo determine oxygen consumption during warmup and during the 3 min all-out test, calibrate the metabolic cart before the test. Run automatic volume and gas calibration immediately before the test and before putting the mask on.\n\t\t\nOpen the automatic volume calibration in the software and press the start button. Store the results if the error is below 3% on the screen.",
    "Open the gas calibration in the software, as well as the calibration gas, and start with the automatic calibration.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The calibration gas consists of 5% CO2, 16% O2, and 79% N2. When 8 green buttons are displayed on the screen at the end of the calibration, the calibration is successful and the results can be stored. Close the gas bottle to ensure no leakage of gas.\nEnsure that the participant's actual body mass is inserted into the computer program. After the participant is chosen by the search engine on the computer, choose \"ergospirometry\" in the software and start with the measurement of room air concentration by pressing the start button.\nTo run this calibration, take the sensor out of the spirometer and press the start button. Calibration is finished when \"ok\" is displayed on the computer.\nMeanwhile, during the calibration, put the oxygen mask on the participant.\nWhen the measurement of room air concentration is finished and the program is ready to measure, put the sensor back into the spirometer. Then, put the whole spirometer into the cavity of the mask; the device is now ready to measure oxygen consumption.\nIn addition, fix the hose of the spirometer somewhere (e.g., on the shoulder with an adhesive tape) so that it does not interfere during the arm crank exercise.\n2. Execution of the Exercise Protocol\nWarmup\n1 min before starting the warmup, start measuring the oxygen consumption at rest when the participant sits at the arm crank ergometer without moving or talking. Press the start button in the software program.\nAt the same time, start the measurement of the heartrate by pressing the red button. Measure the heartrate during the warmup, as well as during and after the test.",
    "Perform a standardized warmup over 2 min at 20 W before the start of the test. During the last 30 s of the warmup, keep the cadence constant at 60 rpm. Count down the last 10 s of the 30-s warmup.\n3 min all-out exercise test\nAt the end of the countdown, make sure to give a clear starting signal by shouting \"go.\" After the start signal is given, allow the participant to accelerate.\nInstruct the participant to accelerate the arm crank ergometer to the maximum possible speed right at the beginning of the test. Keep the cadence at the maximum possible speed during the whole test. For standardization reasons, do not encourage the participants during the tests.\nGive information on duration every 30 s. Finish the test after a duration of 3 min.\nCooldown and post analysis\nAfter finishing the 3 min all-out test, measure the end lactate concentration, if desired, and thereafter every 2 min for the next 10 min. Re-use the same puncture site for blood sampling as was used before the test.\nStop the measurement of oxygen consumption after finishing these 3 min by pressing the stop button. Remove the oxygen mask. Save the measurement of oxygen consumption on the computer by pressing the exit button and by clicking \"yes\" when the software asks for data storage.\n\t\tNOTE: The data is stored in the software program and can easily be converted to a csv document later.\nTo export the data, press the \"Export\" button to convert the file to a csv document for later analysis. Stop the heartrate measurement by pressing the stop button on the left side of the heartrate monitor after all blood samples have been drawn from the earlobe.\n3. Data Analysis and Interpretation of the Results\nPerformance parameters",
    "Analyze several different parameters after finishing this performance test.\n\t\tFirst, save the test and export it to a spreadsheet.\nCalculate the mean power (Pmean = imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55485/55485eq1.jpgimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55485/55485eq2.jpg over 3 min, the peak power, and the minimal power in between these 3-min12.\n\t\tNOTE: the peak power (Ppeak) is the maximal power during the whole 3 min. The power is measured in 0.2-s intervals. The peak power is the highest and the minimal power (Pmin) the lowest single-power measurement.\nCalculate the fatigue index as the power decline per second from the peak power to the end power ((Ppeak [W] – Pmin [W])/(tmin [s] – tpeak [s])).\nCalculate the total work over the whole 3 min by adding the work done every second (Work [J]= resistance [kg] * revolutions per min * flywheel distance [m] * time [min]).\nCalculate the time from the start to the peak power (time to peak power = tpeak [s]). Furthermore, calculate the relative peak (relative Ppeak = Ppeak/kg body mass) and the mean power (relative Pmean = Pmean/kg body mass) by dividing the absolute values by the body mass of the participant.\nDivide the 3-min all-out test into 30-s segments to check the pacing strategy and fatigue over these 3 min. Calculate the mean power for every 30-s segment (Pmean = imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55485/55485eq3.jpgimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55485/55485eq4.jpg.\nOther measurements\nPlace all blood samples into the numbered slots of the blood lactate analyzer and run the measurements automatically by pressing \"analyze.\" Print blood lactate concentrations for later analysis by turning on the printer.\nTransmit the heartrate measurements to the computer using an infrared device from the manufacturer. Open the software of the heartrate monitor and import the data from the heartrate monitor to the software. Store the data locally and, if desired, export it to a spreadsheet for later analysis (e.g., segment analysis)13.",
    "Set a marker right at the beginning of the 3 min and at the end of the 3 min, allowing the average, maximal, and minimal heartrate to be calculated automatically for this segment.\n\t\tNOTE: The heartrate is averaged automatically by the software over 5 s intervals.\nExport the data for oxygen consumption to a csv file (step 2.3) and open it in a spreadsheet for analysis14. Calculate the average oxygen consumption at rest: (VO2_rest = imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55485/55485eq5.jpgimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55485/55485eq6.jpg and during the 3 min (VO2_180s = imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55485/55485eq1.jpgimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55485/55485eq7.jpg, as well as the peak oxygen consumption and oxygen consumption during the 30-s segments: (VO2_30s = imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55485/55485eq3.jpgimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55485/55485eq8.jpg.\n\t\tNOTE: The data for oxygen consumption are measured breath-by-breath and then averaged automatically over a duration of 15 s per segment. The peak oxygen consumption is the highest value over a 15-s interval during the 3-min exercise test.\nStatistics\nUse the Shapiro-Wilk test, the Q-Q-plot, and the Kolmogorov Smirnov tests to check the normal distribution of the data. If the data is normally distributed, present it as the mean and the standard deviation (SD).\nAnalyze the test-retest reliability using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC; 3,1 model)15.\nCalculate the absolute and relative reliability using the standard error of the measurement (SEM), coefficient of variation (CV), smallest real difference (SRD), and 95% confidence interval of the ICC16.\n\t\tNOTE: The ICC should be interpreted according to Munro`s classification17: 0.26 to 0.49 reflects a low correlation; 0.50 to 0.69 reflects a moderate correlation; 0.70 to 0.89 reflects a high correlation; and 0.90 to 1.0 indicates a very high correlation. The absolute reliability should be presented as the SRD, CV, and SEM, and the relative reliability should be in the form of the ICC16,18.",
    "Analyze significant changes between the two test sessions using a paired t-test. To show the agreement of the data sets of both test sessions, use Bland-Altman19 plots. Use statistical software to perform data analysis; set a statistical significance level of 0.05 throughout.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
