A minimal of 8 Gb memory and 1 core is required. TARSII and CARSII are functional on Linux and Mac OSX systems.\nThe TARSII/CARSII packages are available through the following public repository:\nhttps://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5484230[href=https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5484230]\nTo activate TARSII and CARSII, you may follow the command lines below:\ncd TARSII/CARSII_folder\nchmod u+x ∗\ncd ./bin\nchmod u+x ∗\nPredict germline DMRs using TARSII\nConsidering germline DMRs are composed of both hypomethylated and hypermethylated alleles, those regions should have partial DNA methylation and should enrich for both hypomethylated and hypermethylated reads (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Because DMRs are believed to be generally conserved across different tissues (Babak et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), identifying common candidate DMRs across different tissues can help reduce FDR. These are the basis for imprinting prediction by TARSII.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1502-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "In this step, candidate DMRs in each tissue are selected out by two analyses. First, genomic regions containing consecutive CpG sites (>= 10) with 5mC level ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 are selected out as partially methylated domains (PMDs) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Then, the PMDs enriched for both hypomethylated reads (5mC <= 0.2, reads percentage >= 30%) and hypermethylated reads (5mC >= 0.8, reads percentage >= 30%) are identified as candidate DMRs (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nCandidate DMRs of individual somatic tissue methylome are identified following the command:\n# Take cortex methylome data as an example\nTARSII_step1_DMR_identify.sh -x cortex_5mC.wig -s\ncortex_picard_deduplicated.sam -o cortex\n# Run this script for DNA methylome of each somatic tissue\nNote: The input files and output file name are mandatory; other parameters have been optimized but can be adjusted according to user-specific requests.\nParameters should be provided:\n-x    wig file presenting DNA methylation levels at base resolution\n-s    sorted sam file with duplicates removed\n-o    output file name\nParameters available to be adjusted through [options]:\n-n    minimal CpG number required to be included in a PMD.

Option -c/-C is applied to the first/last bin",
    "-c    minimal percentages of hypomethylated reads versus total reads for a candidate DMR. Default: 0.3 (30%) (ranges from 0 to 1)\n-C    minimal percentages of hypermethylated reads versus total reads for a candidate DMR. Default: 0.3 (30%) (ranges from 0 to 1)\nFollowing completion of step 2, users will get 3 output files in working directory that include (troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]):\nA bed file containing all PMDs identified from the input DNA methylome.\nA tab separated file containing all PMDs with additional information as percentage of hypomethylated reads, percentage of hypermethylated reads and total reads number in each bin.\nA bed file containing all candidate DMRs identified from the input DNA methylome for processing in the next step.\nIdentify common candidate DMRs from different somatic tissues\nTiming: 5 min\nIn this step, the overlapping candidate DMRs from all tissues are merged as one (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). Then, if the candidate DMRs from at least 5 different tissues show overlap with the merged candidate DMRs, those candidate DMRs are defined as putative imprinted DMRs identified by TARSII (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nThe putative imprinted DMRs are identified through integrated analysis of candidate DMRs in different somatic tissues following the command:\nTARSII_step2_DMR_integration.sh -f ‘cerebellum_DMR_candidate.bed\ncortex_DMR_candidate.bed heart_DMR_candidate.bed\nintestine_DMR_candidate.bed kidney_DMR_candidate.bed\nliver_DMR_candidate.bed’ -o human\nNote: Users should include all the bed files of candidate DMRs and an output file name to run this script. The minimal number of tissues required for a putative imprinted DMR to be identified could be adjusted with the parameter -n. However, users should be cautious that reducing the cutoff will increase false discovery rate, while increasing the cutoff may increase the false negative rate.\nParameters should be provided:\n-f    all bed files containing candidate DMRs identified from step 1\nNote: File names should be located within ‘ ’ symbol\n-o    output file name",
    "Parameters available to be adjusted through [options]:\n-n    minimal number of tissues for a putative imprinted DMR to be commonly identified in (>= 1)\nFollowing completion of step 4, users will get 1 bed file presenting the putative imprinted DMRs in working directory.\nCategorize parental origin of the putative imprinted DMRs predicted by TARSII\nTiming: 10 min\nSince the prediction of TARSII is independent of SNPs, the parental origin of these imprinted DMRs cannot be directly inferred from somatic tissue methylomes by TARSII. Nevertheless, considering the allelic DNA methylation of germline DMRs is inherited from gametes, the differentially methylated regions between sperm and oocyte, as well as between androgenetic and parthenogenetic early embryos, can help infer the parental origin of the predicted imprinted DMRs without SNP information.\nIn this step, paternal and maternal DMRs in sperm/oocyte or uniparental early embryos are identified. Based on those parental DMRs, TARSII predicted putative imprinted DMRs can be categorized into maternal germline DMRs, paternal germline DMRs and somatic DMRs (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nWig files showing DNA methylation levels at base resolution from sperm/oocyte or uniparental early embryos are required, as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B. To prepare for these files, please refer to “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]” and our previous study (Chu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nParental origin of the putative imprinted DMRs predicted by TARSII can be categorized following the command:\nTARSII_step3_germline_DMR.sh -p androgenetic_5mC.wig -m\nparthenogenetic_5mC.wig -b human_putative_imprinted_DMR.bed -o human\nNote: The input files and output file name are mandatory; other parameters have been optimized but can be adjusted according to user-specific requests.\nParameters should be provided:\n-p    wig file presenting DNA methylation levels at base resolution of sperm/androgenetic embryos\n-m    wig file presenting DNA methylation levels at base resolution of oocyte/parthenogenetic embryos\n-b    bed file of the imprinted DMRs predicted by TARSII (generated from step 4)",

Default: 0.15 (ranges from 0 to 1)\n-C    maximal maternal methylation level in a paternal DMR in gemmates. Default: 0.30 (ranges from 0 to 1)\nFollowing completion of step 7, users will get 5 files in working directory. File 3, 4, 5 (below) are the final results generated by TARSII (troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problems 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nA bed file contains paternal DMRs in gemmates with average methylation levels of maternal and paternal alleles.\nA bed file contains maternal DMRs in gemmates with average methylation levels of paternal and maternal alleles\nA bed file contains maternal germline DMRs predicted by TARSII.\nA bed file contains paternal germline DMRs predicted by TARSII.\nA bed file contains somatic DMRs predicted by TARSII.\nPredict germline DMRs using CARSII\nTARSII predicts the germline DMRs through integrated analyses of DNA methylomes from different somatic tissues. However, in some case, identification of tissue-specific imprinting is required. To help predict germline DMRs in a single tissue independent of SNPs, we developed another computational tool, CARSII.",
    "Different from the genome-wide identification of germline DMRs in TARSII, only CpG islands (genomic regions with high CpG density) are included in the analysis of CARSII. This is mainly because: 1) DNA methylation in CpG islands is generally under rigid regulation of multiple transcription factors and epigenetic regulators (Deaton and Bird, 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Thus, the DNA methylation in CpG islands is more stable across different cells compared to that of a random region in genome; 2) the majority of germline DMRs in mammals, such as mouse and human, overlap with GpG islands. In contrast, CpG islands only occupy a small portion of the genome (Chu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Thus, the chances for a germline DMR to be identified from a CpG island are much higher than that from a random region in the genome.\nNotably, the definition of CpG islands may vary according to different standards used. Nevertheless, we recommend using the CpG islands defined in the UCSC Genome Browser database, which could be found in the following link:\nhttps://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html[href=https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html]\nIdentify candidate differentially methylated CpG-islands (DMCs) from a single DNA methylome by CARSII\nTiming: 6 h\nThe biological basis of CARSII is similar to TARSII, which assumes germline DMRs are enriched for both hypomethylated and hypermethylated alleles (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). However, due to heterogeneity of the cells in a tissue, methylation inconsistency in part of the CpG islands and experimental variations caused by batch effects, the false discovery rate (FDR) of CARSII is relatively higher than that of TARSII. Thus, to help reduce the FDR in CARSII, we designed additional steps to remove germline DMRs that may be resulted from random effect or methylation inconsistency.",
    "In this step, CpG islands that enriched for both hypomethylated reads (5mC <= 0.2, reads percentage >= 30%) and hypermethylated reads (5mC >= 0.8, reads percentage >= 30%) are first selected as candidate DMCs (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). Then, random test is performed to calculate the FDR for each candidate DMC and those with FDR < 0.05 were removed (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). Finally, the methylation consistency in each candidate DMC is determined and candidate DMCs with inconsistent DNA methylation along the CpG island are removed (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1502-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

The candidate DMCs in this file are viewed as the putative imprinted DMCs predicated by CARSII.\nCategorize parental origin of the putative imprinted DMCs predicted by CARSII\nTiming: 10 min\nSimilar to TARSII, in this step, paternal and maternal-specific methylated CpG-islands in gemmates are identified by analyzing DNA methylomes in sperm/oocyte or uniparental early embryos (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D). Then, based on those parental-specific methylated CpG-islands, putative imprinted DMCs are categorized into maternal germline DMCs, paternal germline DMCs and somatic DMCs (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nParental origin of imprinted DMCs predicted by CARSII can be identified following the command:\n# Take cortex methylome data as an example\nCARSII_step2_germline_DMR.sh -p androgenetic_5mC.wig -m\nparthenogenetic_5mC.wig -b cortex_putative_imprinted_DMC.bed -o cortex",

Nevertheless, if the user does use this approach to predict somatic DMCs, validation by allelic methylation analysis is suggested before moving forward (see the following part).\nAnalysis of allelic DNA methylation for the putative imprinted DMRs with CGmapTools",
    "Although the putative germline DMRs predicted by TARSII and CARSII is relatively accurate (Chu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]), certain level of false discovery rate is unavoidable without the information of the allelic DNA methylation. Therefore, we introduce CGmapTools (Guo et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) to help easily and quickly validate the imprinted DMRs predicted by TARSII/CARSII. CGmapTools is capable of identifying SNPs directly from DNA methylomes and calculating allelic methylation levels associated with those SNPs.\nBy combining TARSII/CARSII and CGmapTools, putative imprinted DMRs in the whole genome can be identified first using TARSII/CARSII independent of SNPs. Then, allelic methylation of the putative imprinted DMRs can be calculated by CGmapTools with only a few SNPs located within those DMRs. In this way, instead of collecting large number of DNA methylomes from many different individuals and SNPs from their parents’ genomes, only a few DNA methylomes are sufficient for accurate de novo identification of imprinted regions in outbred mammals.\nHere, we only provide an integrated analysis of CGmaptools and TARSII/CARSII. For a complete and detailed instructions on CGmapTools, please refer to the published study (Guo et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) and the link below:\nhttps://cgmaptools.github.io/[href=https://cgmaptools.github.io/]\nIdentify SNPs from DNA methylome using CGmapTools\nTiming: 1 day\nIn this step, SNPs in certain DNA methylome are extracted using CGmapTools (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). In TARSII, we can extract SNPs from every DNA methylome that used for analysis.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1502-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

To infer the parental origin of non-germline/somatic DMRs, SNPs identified from parental genomes are still needed.\nCalculate allelic DNA methylation using CGmapTools\nTiming: 5 min\nAllelic DNA methylation is calculated by CGmapTools following the command:\n# Take cortex methylome data as an example\ncgmaptools asm -r human_genome.fa -b cortex_picard_deduplicated.bam -l\ncortex_SNP_DMRs.vcf > cortex_SNP_DMRs.asm\nNote: The asm file contains information on allelic DNA methylation value, p-value and false discovery rate for each SNP in the analyzed DNA methylome. A TRUE or FALSE judgement is provided as an inference to users about whether the allelic methylation associated with a particular SNP is significantly different or not (troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).",
    "Critical: Since the length and range of imprinted DMRs predicted by TARSII/CARSII can vary when compared to the real imprinted DMRs, some SNPs located within the predicted imprinted DMRs may actually located outside of the real imprinted DMRs. Thus, to check the accurate location of individual SNP using genome browser tools on UCSC genome browser or integrative genomic viewer (IGV) is highly recommended. In general, informative SNPs should locate within a clear partially methylated domain. On the other hand, it would be more solid if several SNPs within certain DMR are all exhibit significant allelic DNA methylation differences.\nAs an example, we predicted the germline DMRs by TARSII using human somatic tissue methylomes as indicated in “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]”. In total, 29 of germline DMRs were identified, most of which are maternal germline DMRs except H19 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). 22 of the 29 germline DMRs are associated with at least 1 SNP identified by CGmapTools based on the human somatic tissue methylomes (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). All of those SNP-associated germline DMRs exhibit clear allele-specific DNA methylation (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C), confirming the high accuracy of our approaches."
