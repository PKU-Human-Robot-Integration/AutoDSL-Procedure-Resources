    "1. Equipment Preparation\nObtain a chemostat jar (150-250 ml) or an Erlenmeyer flask (250 ml) containing an inlet port and an outlet port. Connect the ports with silicon tubing allowing for flow rates of 10-100 ml/hr. Optionally, use an air vent, an air outlet port, and temperature-controlled water inlet and outlet ports.\nObtain a device suitable for the chemostat jar that provides for agitation and temperature control (or use a rotary shaking incubator).\nObtain two peristaltic pumps in order to deliver fresh medium and collect the culture.\nObtain a reservoir jar (10-20 L) containing a medium outlet port and an air inlet port.\nObtain silicon tubing suitable for the dilution rate (i.e., ID 0.8 mm, flow range 0.06-36 ml/min; L/S 13 tubing).\n2. Medium Preparation and Sterilization\nInitial Medium\n\t\nDissolve 0.3 g glucose, 0.08 g NH4Cl, 0.05 g NaCl, 0.75 g Na2HPO4·2H2O, and 0.3 g KH2PO4 in 90 ml distilled water (D.W.) in a chemostat jar.\nSeal the chemostat jar along with the tubing using clamps. Do not seal the air vent.\nSterilize the chemostat jar in an autoclave at 121 °C for 15 min. After sterilization, store the chemostat jar at room temperature.\nDissolve 0.02 g MgSO4·7H2O, 0.01 g CaCl2, and 0.1 mg thiamine in 10 ml D.W. (solution A).\nFilter solution A using a syringe and a pre-sterilized syringe filter (a 0.45 µm pore filter).\nAdd the solution A filtrates to the chemostat jar.\nStress Medium\n\t\nDissolve 30 g glucose, 8 g NH4Cl, 5 g NaCl, 75 g Na2HPO4·2H2O, 30 g KH2PO4, and 300 g disodium succinate hexahydrate (Na2·succinate·6H2O; the stressor used in this experiment) in 9.9 L D.W. in a reservoir jar.\nSeal the reservoir jar along with the tubing using clamps. Do not seal the air vent.",
    "Sterilize the reservoir jar in an autoclave at 121 °C for 15 min. After sterilization, store the jar at room temperature.\nDissolve 2 g MgSO4·7H2O, 1 g CaCl2, and 10 mg thiamine in 100 ml D.W. (solution A).\nFilter solution A with a syringe and a pre-sterilized syringe filter (a 0.45 µm pore filter).\nAdd the solution A filtrates to the reservoir jar.\nAseptically connect the sterilized silicon tubing to the reservoir jar and attach the peristaltic pumps.\nHigh-stress Medium\n\t\nPrepare the medium as in section 2.2, but with a greater concentration of stressor (i.e., 3-5 g/L higher in the succinate adaptation).\n\t\tNote: This protocol is for adaptation to a stress that can be delivered via the medium. In the case of physical stressors such as temperature, agitation, or illumination, the cultivation should be designed accordingly.\n3. Initial Cultivation\nInoculate a single colony of wild-type E. coli in a 15 ml test tube containing 4 ml of initial medium.\nIncubate the test tube in a shaking incubator for 12 hr at 37 °C and 220 rpm.\nAseptically transfer 1 ml of preculture to the chemostat jar.\nIncubate the chemostat jar, providing for aeration (air 50 ml/min) and agitation (200 rpm), at 37 °C for 6 hr.\n4. Stress Adaptation\nAseptically connect the end of the silicon tubing from the pumps to the chemostat jar.\nStart the outlet pump (10 ml/hr or higher) and collect culture.\n\tNote: The culture should be in the exponential phase, typically 4-8 hr after initial cultivation.\nCheck the optical density (600 nm) of the culture from the outlet tubing.\nStart the inlet pump (10 ml/hr, corresponding to a rate of dilution of 0.1 hr-1).\nCheck the optical density of the culture at 600 nm from the outlet tubing every 24 hr.",
    "Operate the chemostat for 96 hr (9.6-fold turnover) or more. If the optical density is stable, exchange the reservoir containing the high-stress medium. If the optical density is lower than 0.2, stop the feeding inlet pump for 6 hr. Restart the inlet pump and check that the optical density is over 0.2.\nGradually increase the concentration of the stressor by changing to a reservoir containing a higher stressor concentration.\nTake samples of the adapted culture whenever it reaches a milestone (e.g., a strain adapted to 100 g/L succinate stress), and store for further genomic analysis.\nFor sample storage, mix the culture sample (0.5 ml) with a sterilized 80% glycerol solution (0.5 ml) and store it at -80 °C.\n\tNote: If the microorganism acquires an ability to degrade the stressor during the ALE process, the stressor concentration in the fermentation jar is not the same as that in the fresh reservoir.\n5. Single-colony Isolation of the Stress-adapted Strain\nPrepare agar plate medium (1.6% agar) containing the same stressor and at the same concentration of medium.\nPlate the outlet culture (0.1 ml) from the chemostat, and incubate at 37 °C for 16 hr.\nPick single colonies from the plate using a sterile toothpick and inoculate them in 15 ml test tubes containing the same stressor and at the same medium concentration as in the chemostat, and incubate for 6 hr.\nTransfer 1 ml of culture broth into a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 50 ml of medium. Harvest 0.5 ml of the culture broth every 1 hr, and measure the O.D. at 600 nm. Compare the growth rate of the adapted strain to that of the wild-type strain given the stressor.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
