    "1. Virus Storage and Preparation\nThe use of replication-incompetent AAV vectors for delivering opsin genes to rodent brain is approved for Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1) and requires proper protection and handling procedures as outlined in the U.S. Government publication, Biosafety in Microbiology and Biomedical Laboratories, available at the Centers for Disease Control's website at (http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/index.htm[href=http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/index.htm]).\nIn order to avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles, pipette virus from manufacturer's vial into smaller working aliquots in a Class II Biosafety Cabinet and store in a -80 °C freezer.\nPrior to stereotactic injection, allow an aliquot to thaw on ice and then briefly spin down with a bench top centrifuge.\nSlowly backfill a Hamilton glass syringe and needle with a small amount of silicone or mineral oil. Make sure there are no visible air bubbles in the syringe barrel. Insert the syringe into a microinjector pump and attach the pump directly to the vertical stereotaxic arm (i.e. stereotaxic manipulator).\nLower the stereotaxic arm until the tip of the needle touches the bottom of the virus aliquot tube. Use the controller for the microinjector pump to withdraw the desired volume of virus (1.5 μl for a 1 μl injection).\nAll material and surfaces that come into contact with virus should be decontaminated with a disinfectant such as chlorine bleach (10%).\n2. Surgery and Virus Injection\nAnesthetize animal with a ketamine (rat; 125 mg/kg, i.p.) - xylazine (rat; 10 mg/kg, i.p.) cocktail. To gauge effectiveness of anesthesia, check for a reflex response to a toe pinch and give supplemental doses of ketamine if needed. Using standard aseptic surgical methods, place animal into a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf Instruments).",
    "Make a midline incision through the skin on top of the animal skull with small surgical scissors or scalpel. Gently separate connective tissue and clean the top of the skull with a small bone scraper.\nVerify that the head of the animal is level such that the z coordinates for bregma and lambda are equal. Determine the stereotaxic coordinates for the target brain area from a brain atlas such as The Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates (George Paxinos and Charles Watson, Academic Press, 2007) or The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates (Keith B.J. Franklin and George Paxinos, Academic Press, 2007). Mark the intended site of injection with a surgical pen.\nCarefully thin the skull over the target area using a hand-held drill and stop when the drill bit reaches the bottom of the skull. Using a pair of extra fine forceps, remove the thinned bone in order to expose the dura.\nPosition the syringe needle over the target area and lower the needle until it touches the dura and use this point to calculate the z coordinate. Very slowly lower the injection needle into the brain until the proper z position is reached. In this protocol, the prelimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex (2.7 mm anterior to bregma, ± 0.5 mm lateral to the midline, and -2.2 mm from dura) or the dorsal subiculum (-6.0 mm anterior to bregma, ± 3.0 mm lateral to the midline, and -2.0 mm from dura) is targeted in an adult Sprague Dawley male rat (approx. 275 g).\nInject virus at a rate of 0.1 μl/min. After the injection is completed wait 10 min before withdrawing the needle to avoid backflow of the virus to the brain surface.",
    "Use a sewing suture with attached needle to seal the skin and apply antibiotics to the wound.\nThe time course of ChR2 and NpHR functional expression from AAV vectors will vary depending on the experimental design and viral titer. For this experiment, in vivo recordings were performed 18-21 days post injection.\n3. Light Delivery and In vivo Recording of ChR2 or NpHR-expressing Neurons\nAttach a tungsten electrode (~1-1.5 MΩ, MicroProbes) to a glass capillary tube (Fisher Scientific) using super glue.\nUse a fiber stripping tool (Thorlabs) to expose the bare end of a multimode optical fiber (200 μm diameter core, Thorlabs) and clean fiber tip with ethanol. Very lightly score fiber tip with a wedge shaped diamond knife (Thorlabs) and carefully remove the excess fiber (e.g. with fine forceps). The fiber should cleave easily at the score.\nConnect the FC end of the fiber to the PC connector on the output port of a 200 mW single diode laser (www.Lumiphy.com[href=http://www.lumiphy.com]) with the desired wavelength. Make sure that appropriate protective eyewear is worn at all times when working with lasers.\nMeasure the laser intensity at the tip of the optic fiber using an optical power meter (www.Lumiphy.com[href=http://www.lumiphy.com/] ). For in vivo recordings, light intensity as little as 20-100 mW/mm2 can reliably evoke ChR2- or NpHR-mediated activation or silencing, respectively, of neuronal activity.\nInsert the optical fiber into the capillary tube. Position the fiber tip approximately 500 μm above the tip of tungsten electrode and tie a thin suture thread twice at a few points near the tip so that the electrode and the fiber are straight. Make sure that the distance between the tip of electrode and the nearest knot is long enough for insertion to the target region.",
    "Prepare the animal as in steps 2.1 and 2.2 above. Use the initial craniotomy as a guide to make a new clean small window in the skull for positioning the optrode (www.Lumiphy.com[href=http://www.lumiphy.com/] ). Make a small incision on the dura using a fine needle.\nCarefully lower the optrode through the skull window and into the brain to the transduced region using a micromanipulator (Narishige). Then advance the optrode slowly in 10-50 μm steps until the emergence of a light-responsive cell.\nA custom software user interface (NeuroLux Pro www.Lumiphy.com[href=http://www.lumiphy.com/]) written in LabVIEW (National Instruments) is used to control the single diode laser and to visualize and record ongoing neural activity. Recorded signals are captured with an ExAmp-20K (Kation Scientific) amplifier band-pass filtered (0.3-8 kHz), and a National Instruments analog to digital board (NI USB-6009). The NeuroLux Pro user interface allows the choice of analog inputs (choose two channels for the neuronal and TTL signal) and digital output. The user may define the sampling rate (20 kHz), the baseline period (pre-light), and post-light period. The user may define the TTL laser stimulation pulse width, frequency and stimulation period (if frequency is 20 Hz and stimulation period is 500 msec, 10 laser pulses with defined pulse width are delivered). The user also can choose continuous light delivery (e.g., Figure 1). For repeated recordings, the user also may define the number of pulse trains and the interval between trains. Data can be acquired with or without recording to disk.\nFollowing recording, animals are anesthetized with the ketamine/xylazine cocktail and transcardially perfused with physiological saline and paraformaldehyde (4%) in order to verify optrode placement and opsin expression."
