    "All procedures on experimental animals described in both the video and manuscript were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Alberta\n1. Surgical anesthesia and surgical preparation of the pigs.\nPremedicate 50 kg Landrace-Yorkshire commercial pigs intramuscularly with the anesthetic drug cocktail containing ketamine hydrochloride (22 mg/kg,), xylazine hydrochloride (2.2 mg/kg) and glycopyrrolate hydrochloride (10 µg/kg).\nSet up all equipment involved with monitoring clinical parameters at the end of the table near the pig's head. Ensure the equipment will not restrict access to the pig. Produce accurate arterial blood pressure measurement by placing the pressure transducer in a horizontal plane, level with the heart.\nAnesthetize the pigs with inhaled isoflurane gas (4%-5% isoflurane at 500-1000 mL/min O2) using a properly sized face mask. Visualize the vocal cords with a veterinary laryngoscope (17-25 cm long straight blade) and apply topical 10% lidocaine spay to the vocal cords to limit the risk of laryngospasm and airway obstruction.\nIntubate the pigs by inserting a cuffed endotracheal tube (9.0 mm internal diameter (ID)) through the vocal cords and maintain anesthesia with isoflurane gas (0.5%-3.0% isoflurane at 1000-2000 mL/min O2). Ventilate the pig on a mechanical ventilator (18-22 breaths/min) and ensure all expired anesthetic gas is scavenged and vented outside the surgical suite. Assess the level of anesthesia by jaw tone, and both pedal and palpebral reflex responses.\n\tNOTE: Administer intravenous Lactated Ringer's Solution (LRS, 10-50 mL/kg/h; see step 1.6) to enhance hemodynamic function and reduce isoflurane gas anesthesia induced depression of cardiovascular output in swine26.",
    "Secure a pulse oximeter to the mucosal surface of the tongue with medical tape to monitor heart rate and the saturation of peripheral blood oxygenation (SpO2). Insert a temperature probe approximately 2-4 cm into the nasal cavity to monitor body temperature. Place the pigs on a heated table to maintain normal body temperature (38-40 °C) during the surgical procedure.\nEnsure surgical sterility with proper tissue preparation.\n\t\nClean the external surface of the ear to prepare for venous catheterization with 10% povidone-iodine surgical scrub solution and allow the solution to air dry.\nWith a 20 G, 1 inch intravenous catheter, catheterize a marginal ear vein to deliver either intravenous fluids (LRS; 10-50 mL/kg/h) or the addition of other anesthetic agents.\nEnhance pig anesthesia and analgesia if needed for invasive procedures with continuous intravenous remifentanil hydrochloride infusion (0.05-0.14 µg/kg/min).\nPlace the pig in a lateral recumbent position and gently extend the front leg approximately 10-12 cm away from the shoulder. Clip the hair on the skin surface of the medial aspect of the brachium (upper forelimb). Landmark the distal brachial artery pulse by palpation.\n\tNOTE: The landmarked location of the artery lies along an oblique plane with the brachium approximately 9 cm from the olecranon, and 5 cm from the flexor aspect of the elbow joint. The brachial artery travels proximally towards the caudal third of the scapula traversing the humerus.\nSimilarly to step 1.6, ensure surgical sterility with proper tissue preparation. Clean the skin surface with 10% povidone-iodine surgical scrub solution and allow the solution to air dry. Drape the brachial artery catheterization site with four small disposable surgical drapes.\n2. Tissue dissection and catheterization of the brachial artery",
    "Make a 6 cm skin incision with a scalpel blade to expose the underlying tissue. Bluntly dissect with Metzenbaum scissors along the medial surfaces of the biceps brachii, deepening the dissection, until the pulsating artery is identified.\nUse cotton swabs to gently tease away the adventitia from the brachial artery, median nerve and brachial vein; structures that are in close proximity and within the same fascial plane. Gentle dissection is required, importantly ensuring minimal injury to the median nerve during the procedure. The brachial artery lies approximately 2.0-2.5 cm underneath the skin and is medial to coracobrachialis and lateral to the tensor fasciae antibrachii and overlies a small segment of the medial head of the triceps muscle27,28.\n\tNOTE: Place a retractor to keep the skin incision open, allowing easier access to the brachial artery. Place a second retractor (optional) to further assist in vessel exposure.\nMoisten all tissues with warm saline (37 °C) for the entire dissection to retain better structural integrity and improved tissue handling during the procedure.\nCreate a tunnel under the artery with blunted forceps, then pass three 2-0 polyglactin sutures underneath the artery. Intentionally, leave the ends of this suture relatively long (3-4 cm) to secure the catheter to the artery. Add a \"loose suture tie\" allowing for quick catheter fastening, to the first two sutures that are separated 1.0 cm from each other and are approximately 1.5-2.0 cm proximal to the third distal suture. Ligate the most distal suture first to occlude the artery.",
    "Insert a 22 G, 1 inch peripheral venous catheter into the artery and then advance the catheter (completely to the catheter hub) off the stylet into the vessel. Partially withdraw the stylet from the catheter to visualize arterial blood, ensuring proper vessel placement of the catheter. Then, firmly secure the catheter in the vessel by tying the middle suture. Remove the stylet and quickly cap the catheter to minimize bleeding.\nFlush the incision and catheter with warm saline (37 °C). Tie the most proximal suture and importantly ensure that the distal suture is tightly secured around the catheter hub as this improves catheter stability and reduces accidental slippage of the catheter from the artery (i.e., during pig repositioning).\n\tNOTE: If the initial placement of the catheter into the artery fails, or the vessel is injured, reinsert the catheter into the artery at a position approximately 0.25 cm proximal to the initial catheter insertion site.\nQuickly attach the LRS filled intravenous extension line with the connected arterial pressure transducer to the catheter, and then lavage the surgical site with warm saline (37 °C), keeping tissues moist, and clean any blood that spilled into the surrounding tissue. Flush the catheter with saline to ensure catheter patency and prevent blood clots from forming along the catheter wall.\n\tNOTE: Check for transducer arterial blood pressure line failures (i.e., leaks), establish transducer baseline by zeroing arterial pressure monitor measurements, and ensure proper arterial blood pressure wave formations.\nEnsure continued catheter patency by maintaining the flush port of the extension line pressurized above 250 mmHg, with a pressure infuser bag delivering 3-5 mL/min LRS.\n\t\nOptional: Place either two 2-0 polypropylene or two 2-0 polyglactin sutures around the catheter hub or intravenous extension line hub to further improve catheter stability within the artery.",
    "3. Tissue closure and body positioning\nClose the muscle layers with a simple continuous suture pattern with a 2-0 polyglactin suture on a cutting or tapered needle and close the skin in a simple interrupted suture pattern with a 2-0 polypropylene suture on a cutting needle.\n\tNOTE: Interchangeably, 2-0 polyglactin or 2-0 polypropylene sutures can be used to close muscle and skin.\nPlace the pig in ventral recumbency by rotating the abdomen of a lateral recumbent pig toward the surgical table. A left sided lateral recumbent pig is rotated in a clockwise direction, while a right sided lateral recumbent pig is rotated in a counter clockwise direction.\nPlace the catheterized forelimb at a 40° angle to the midline of the vertebral column of the pig. This forelimb positioning generates the best arterial blood flow and the most accurate arterial blood pressure measurements.\n4. Monitoring clinical parameters\nMeasure hemodynamic and respiratory parameters as well as temperature throughout the entire anesthetic and surgical procedure using proper monitoring equipment.\nSubscription Required.
