    "1. Reporter strain: Culture and maintenance\nNOTE: To measure the microtubule dynamics and orientation in the PLM neurons, we used the worm strain expressing EBP-2::GFP under the touch neuron specific promoter mec-4 (juIs338 allele)18,25,26. We use standard worm culture and maintenance methods for this strain27.\nPrepare the Nematode Growth Medium (3.0 g/L sodium chloride, 2.5 g/L peptone, 20.0 g/L agar, 10 mg/L cholesterol (diluted from a stock solution of 10 mg/mL)) in water and autoclave the mixture.\nCool the mixture briefly for 10-15 min before supplementing it with 1 mM calcium chloride, 1 mM magnesium sulfate and 25.0 mM potassium phosphate monobasic pH 6.0.\nPour around 9 mL of the mixture into 60 mm Petri dishes using a sterile dispenser followed by storage at room temperature and sterile conditions for a day and subsequent storage at 4 °C.\nPrepare 50 mL of B Broth (5.0 g/L sodium chloride, 10.0 g/L Bacto-Tryptone), autoclave and cool it down before inoculating with a single colony of Escherichia coli (OP50 strain).\nCulture the bacteria at 37 °C for 12 hours. Bring the refrigerated NGM plates to room temperature for seeding and using a sterilized glass spreader make a smear of OP50 bacteria onto the NGM plate.\nKeep the inoculated NGM plates at 37 °C for 12 hours, which will allow the formation of a bacterial lawn for the culturing of C. elegans. These plates can be stored in a 20 °C incubator until usage.\nRear the transgenic strain on the seeded NGM plates.\nSterilize a platinum wire pick on flame and pick 20-25 gravid adult hermaphrodites for transfer to a freshly seeded plate.\nOnce transferred, shift the plate to a 20 °C incubator for 1 h. Then, extract the adults from these plates. These plates will now contain eggs that are age-matched.",
    "Shift the plates to the 20 °C incubator for rearing until they reach the developmental stage of interest which in this case is the L4 stage at 43.5 hours after egg-laying. For more worms, rear multiple plates to avoid crowding.\nAt the desired developmental stage, these worms can be mounted for imaging of the EBP-2::GFP comets.\n2. Sample preparation: Mounting of worms for imaging of EBP-2 comets\nNOTE: To enable live observation of the EBP comets in the PLM neurons, we mounted the worms on agarose pads to minimize their mobility while not compromising the physiology of the neuron. Among the various immobilization methods, we have chosen 0.1 µm Polystyrene bead solution readily available commercially. We have outlined the mounting procedure used specifically for EBP-2::GFP observation.\nPrepare a solution of 10% agarose by melting 0.2 g of agarose in 2 mL of 1x M9 buffer (0.02 M KH2PO4, 0.02 M Na2HPO4, 0.008 M NaCl, 0.02 M NH4Cl) in a 5 mL glass test tube over a flame. This test tube can easily fit into a heating block which keeps the agarose in the molten state until usage.\nUsing a wide-mouthed dropper, dispense a drop (around 100 µL) of this molten agarose over a clean glass slide of 35 mm x 25 mm dimensions.\nWhile it is in the molten state, press the drop with another glass slide to create a thin film of the agarose between the glass slides. The agarose solidifies as a film of around 0.5 - 1.0 mm in thickness in around 30 seconds.",
    "Once the agarose solidifies, hold the bottom slide in the non-dominant hand and the top slide in the dominant hand. Flip up the top slide while holding the bottom slide steady as a result of which the agarose pad sticks to one of the two slides.\nIf the formed agarose pad is larger than the coverslip size (18 mm x 18 mm), then trim the edges of the pad to obtain the required dimensions to ensure proper placement of the coverslip. These agarose pads are for the immediate use and not to be stored.\nVisually inspect the agarose pad for a smooth surface which are moist and suitable for mounting. If the agarose pad is exposed to air and becomes dried, the surface of the agarose pad appears wrinkled. In such a scenario, prepare fresh agarose pad as mentioned in steps 2-6 of this section.\nOn the agarose pad, put 2 µL of 0.1 µm polystyrene bead solution as the mounting medium.\nPick 3-4 worms using a platinum wire pick and shift them onto an unseeded NGM plate. This process ensures the removal of surface bacteria that hinders the immobilization during mounting.\nOnce the worms crawl out of their surface bacteria, pick them up for mounting using a platinum wire pick and resuspend them in the drop of polystyrene beads on the agarose pad.\nCarefully, place an 18 mm x 18 mm coverslip on the worms. To prevent evisceration of the mounted worms, do not move the coverslip after placement.\nMount the prepared slide on the microscope for imaging.\n3. Imaging setup and acquisition",
    "NOTE: EBP comets travel with an approximate velocity of 0.22 µm/s as observed in the mammalian and PLM neurons of C. elegans16,18. To optimally sample the events in a time lapse acquisition as per Nyquist criteria28, spatial and temporal scales of 0.09 µm and 0.43 s, respectively, are required. For the prevention of phototoxicity or photobleaching, we used Spinning Disk acquisition. We have described our imaging setup and acquisition settings below.\nCapture the images using an inverted microscope equipped with a spinning disk unit and camera. Turn on the setup as per the manufacturer's instruction.\nTurn on the software that controls the setup.\nAs this is an inverted microscope, place the slide with the mounted worms on the stage with a low magnification objective (5x or 10x) with the coverslip facing down.\nSet up the light path to eye or visible mode which uses illumination from halogen lamp for transmitted light and mercury arc lamp for reflected light.\nFocus and center a worm in the view field under the brightfield.\nPut the immersion oil and change the magnification to 63x (1.4NA/Oil) and refocus the worm tail in the brightfield for the PLM neurons.\nTurn on the fluorescence of the mercury arc lamp for a brief refocusing of the PLM neurons. Place the correct set of reflector (AF488) in the light path for the visualization of GFP.\nSet the microscope to the camera acquisition by directing the light path to the camera.\n\tNOTE: Controlling the abovementioned steps 4-7 through the Thin Film Transistor (TFT) screen of the microscope is quick and prevents unnecessary exposure to the illumination. Alternatively, control the illumination, reflector through the software.",
    "After the focusing of the PLM neuron in the view field, in the software interface select the illumination of 488 nm laser with 30% power and 300 ms exposure for the camera with Electron Multiplying (EM) gain value 70. Depending upon the reporter expression, vary these parameters as required. Store the settings as a configuration for subsequent imaging sessions.\nThe Channels tab stores the tracks each with a specific illumination and camera setting. The highlighted track allows a live visualization whereas for acquiring an image the track needs to be ticked on. Highlight a channel with brightfield (DIC) for live visualization of the tail of the worm in the workspace. The sample is focused and centered in the live imaging window of the workspace.\nHighlight the channel with 488 nm laser excitation for a quick focusing of the PLM neuron in the live imaging window. Once focused, begin the time lapse acquisition by setting the time series parameters as mentioned in the next step.\nUsing 488 nm laser illumination, set up an experiment with time series for 2 minutes and no time interval between frames. To maintain the temporal scales of image acquisition, we only acquired GFP fluorescence only.\nUsing the Start Experiment tab, begin the acquisition. Using a 63x magnification restricts the spatial resolution to 0.21 µm which is sampled by the camera at the pixel size of 0.09 µm. Acquire a time lapse at 3.3 frames/s for optimally sample the event. The time lapse image had 396 time frames acquired over a duration of 2 min. Following the acquisition, save the image in the default format, which can be later be accessed by the default software or ImageJ.\n4. Observation and analysis",
    "Preview the timelapse acquisition in the default software or open it in Image J through its Bioformats plug-in.\n\tNOTE: We have described the process of image analysis in Image J.\nInstall the Bioformats plug-in in ImageJ.\n\t\nAlternatively, export the default format file into .tif for file compatibility in ImageJ. Export function in ZEN2 results in individual frames of the image as discrete .tif files. We avoid this method to prevent the formation of a large number of files.\nOpen the image in '.czi' format directly in Image J through its 'Bioformats' plugin. The image opens as a multi-image stack. If using the \"export' function of the default software, then reconstitute the images as a multi-image stack using the following workflow in ImageJ: ImageJ Program > Image Menu > Stacks Submenu > Images To Stack.\nPreview the image as a movie using the Play icon at the left bottom corner of the image window. The comets can be seen as bright mobile punctae in the cell body and processes of the PLM neuron. If the comets are visible clearly, proceed to step 8 otherwise follow steps 5-7 of this section.\nConvert the color profile of the image using the Lookup Table (LUT) to a grayscale image: ImageJ program > Image menu > Lookup Tables submenu > Select Grays.\nInvert the LUT profile of the image for easy visualization: ImageJ program > Image menu > Lookup Tables submenu > Invert LUT.\nAdjust the brightness and the contrast of the image for seeing the comets: ImageJ program > Image menu > Adjust submenu > Brightness/Contrast.\n\t\nMove the sliders of Minimum, Maximum, Brightness, and Contrast for the desired scaling of the intensities across the image. We quantified the images with comets visible distinctly.",
    "The basic version of ImageJ has startup tools represented as icons. Locate and right-click the icon with a line to open a dropdown menu and select the Segmented line. Draw the segmented line on the regions of interest (ROI) with its origin on or near the cell body of the neuron.\n\t\nFor later considerations, save the segmented line ROI through the ROI manager using the following workflow: ImageJ > Analyze > Tools > ROI manager > Select the drawn trace in the image and click Add in the ROI manager window > More in the ROI manager window > Save.\nBefore generating the kymograph, as the spatial and temporal scales are different remove the scaling to obtain the measurements in pixels using the following:\nImageJ > Analyze > Set scale > Click to remove scale > Ok.\nUsing the Reslice function under the Image > Stacks dropdown menu, generate a kymograph. The kymograph is a representation of the segmented ROI in time. The horizontal axis represents the distance and the vertical axis represents the time. The diagonal traces represent the moving comets. Generally, the kymograph takes the color profile of the image otherwise assign a color profile as described in the preceding steps 5-6 for the visualization of the diagonal traces.\nUsing the Straight line function in the drop-down menu of the Line tool (refer to step 9 of this section) draw straight lines over each of the diagonal traces and append them in the ROI manager.\nUnder the Analyze tab, go to Set Measurements and select Mean Intensity and Bounding Rectangle parameters for measuring the traces.",
    "In the ROI manager window, click Measure which will open a Result window which will yield the mean intensity of ROI, the X and Y coordinates of the line traces, Width, Height, Angle, and Length of the line traces. This window can be saved as a .csv format and later imported into a data analysis program.\nIn the spreadsheet program, the results window opens with the values distributed in rows and columns. The relevant values are the width, height, and angle of the traces. The width gives the displacement of the trace, height gives the duration and the angle represents the vector. As the width and height values are in pixels, multiply them with the spatial and temporal scales, respectively, for obtaining the standard measurable parameters.\nAs the left side of the kymograph is proximal to the cell body, depending on the angle, classify comets into plus-end-out or minus-end-out (i.e., away from the cell body or towards the cell body, respectively). Classify angles between 1° to -89° and -91° to -179° as plus-end-out and minus-end-out, respectively. Collate data from multiple kymographs in a spreadsheet for a study and statistically represent.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
