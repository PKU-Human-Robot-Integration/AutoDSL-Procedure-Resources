    "All procedures described follow the animal care guidelines of Duke University School of Medicine.\n1. Prior to Starting the Procedure\nNote: Prior to any animal procedures, ensure that appropriate institutional permission has been obtained. As with all procedures, use appropriate pain medication to ensure that there is no animal suffering.\nFlush catheters with heparinized sterile saline (100 U/ml) to ensure the patency. Mark a point from the tip of the catheter equivalent to the length from the heart to the mid of the neck (approximately 4 cm for rats and 2 cm for mice).\nAnesthetize the mouse or rat. Choices of anesthetic include isoflurane (induction 3-4%, maintenance 1.5% mixed with 100% oxygen), ketamine/xylazine (80-120/10 mg/kg) and pentobarbital (40-80 mg/kg)6.\n\t\nFor example, with ketamine:xylazine (80-120 mg/kg: 10-16 mg/kg IP for mice and 80-100 mg/kg: 5-10 mg/kg IP for rats), a single dose lasts for 20-50 min of anesthesia. For echocardiography, anesthetize mouse or rat with isoflurane (3-4% for induction and 1.5% for maintenance). Assess anesthetic depth by pinching the rodent in the surgical area to confirm that withdrawal reflexes are absent. Use veterinary ointment on eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\n\t\tNote: Different anesthetic agents can be used to obtain reliable results with proper use and optimization (reviewed elsewhere6). Our preference for catheterization is to use ketamine:xylazine. Overdose with ketamine/xylazine may profoundly decrease heart rate and cardiac function, so it is critical to maintain proper temperature and respiratory control. To maintain heart rate (> 400/min) in mice, we routinely perform bilateral vagotomy. The amount of ketamine/xylazine here will typically last 20-30 min, which is sufficient to perform either open- or closed-chest heart catheterization followed by euthanizing the animal.\nPrepare the rat/mouse for the surgical procedure (Figure 1).",
    "Shave the fur from the chest (to allow echocardiography) and from the surgical region, in the right neck.\nScrub the shaved surgical regions with a circular sweep from the center outwards using betadine, followed by cleansing with a 70% alcohol swab.\nPlace the animal on a surgical platform with a warming pad underneath. Set the heating level to maintain a body temperature of 37-37.5 °C. Monitor body temperature with a rectal probe. Hypothermia can result in significant bradycardia and hyperthermia results in significant tachycardia.\n2. Echocardiography\nNote: A full description of rodent echocardiography is described elsewhere7. For the mouse, prior to anesthesia, images can be obtained on the awake, manually restrained animal. For the rat, anesthesia prior to echocardiography is preferred as rats are too large to be manually restrained while awake).\nParasternal Long Axis (PLAX) View.\n\t\nPlace the animal in a supine position on the platform or restrain it manually.\nSelect B Mode to project a 2D live image.\nAlign the ultrasound transducer with a frequency of 40 MHz for mouse or 25 MHz for Rats to the left parasternal line, and then rotate the transducer counterclockwise 30° with the probe indicator pointing in the caudal direction (5 to 11 o'clock line position). Angle the transducer slightly (rocking along the short axis of the transducer in the same tomographic plane) to obtain a full LV chamber view in the center of the screen.\nLocate and view these anatomic structures (Figure 2A): the lumen of the left ventricle (LV); Interventricular septum (IVS); the lumen of the right ventricle (RV); Ascending aorta (AO); and Left atrium (LA).",
    "Switch to M Mode, once these above structures are clearly visualized. Place the indicator line through the widest part of LV lumen using AO as the reference point and also make the focus depth lie in the center of LV Chamber (Figure 2B). Make similar measurements of the RV by changing angulation of the transducer and obtaining M mode measurements.\nUse cine store to create a video loop to record the data for offline measurement (LV chamber dimension, FS and LV wall thickness).\nObtain a doppler tracing of the aortic outflow in PW Doppler Mode by placing the PW cursor in the aorta and recording (Figure 2C).\n Parasternal Short-axis View (PSAX) at the Aortic Level.\n\t\nSwitch to B Mode.\nRotate the transducer 90° clockwise from the parasternal long axis view to obtain the parasternal short-axis view (Figure 3). Move and angle the transducer toward the cranium to identify the aortic valve cross section view.\nIdentify the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) as a crescent-shaped structure localized to the upper right to the aorta, continued with pulmonary valve leaflets and pulmonary artery.\nHold steady at the same position manually. Switch to PW Doppler Mode.\n\t\tNote: A station platform for holding the rodent and probe can be used to minimize movement and variation in transducer position.\nPlace the sample volume proximal to the level of pulmonary valve in the center of the right ventricular outflow tract and then position the cursor parallel to the direction of blood flow through the vessel (Figure 3B).\n\t\tNote: It is important to adjust the sampling angle to the direction of blood flow or use the ultrasound software to correct for a change in angle. Without correction, the maximum angle to the vessel is 30°, which corresponds to ~ 15% underestimate of the velocity.",
    "Adjust the scale (the velocity of blood flow) as needed to obtain a \"good\" Doppler envelope, which has white borders and a dark hollow inside indicating laminar blood flow (Figure 3C). Record the Doppler tracing.\n\t\tNote: A \"bad\" Doppler envelope does not accommodate sufficient white borders and a dark hollow.\nIf catheterization is not performed at this juncture, allow the rodent to recover if anesthesia was used. Do not leave the rodent unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency and do not return it to the company of other animals until it is fully recovered. If catheterization is performed, proceed to Section 3.\n3. Right Heart Catheterization\n Closed-chest approach for RV pressure measurement\n\t\nSetup:\n\t\t\nConnect the pressure transducer to input channel 1. In the software, set channel 1 for pressure and channel 2 for heart rate.\nTo convert units to mmHg, record the baseline trace, perform a pressure calibration manually using a pressure gauge (if using a blood pressure transducer and PE tubing). Then perform units conversion under channel 1.\nTo set heart rate, turn off the input of channel 2. Select cyclic measurements under channel 2 and choose channel 1 for source and rate for measurement.\nPlace the mouse/rat underneath a dissection microscope with the focus in depth and a magnification of 5x.\nIncise the skin from the mandible to the sternum (Figure 1). Place a pair of retractors to each side of the incision to fully expose the cervical area.\nBluntly dissect to separate the salivary glands to expose the right external jugular vein using fine blunt tip forceps (Figure 4A, B).\nCarefully isolate the right external jugular vein from the surrounding connective tissue.",
    "Place two pieces of silk suture (4-0 for rats; 6-0 for mice) underneath the right external jugular vein, ligate the vein distally (as close to the mandible as possible), and then tie a loose knot proximally (Figure 4C).\nUse iris scissors to make a small \"nick\" (cut) proximal to the distal tied knot.\nHold the catheter with a forceps and insert the catheter into the cut of the vein, and then tighten the proximal knot.\n\t\tNote: We usually use polyethylene (PE)-10 tubing (~2 Fr size) for mice and PE-50 (~3 Fr size) for rats, which is connected to the regular pressure transducer through a 31 G or 21 G needle and calibrated. Mark the catheter with a marker at a length roughly corresponding to placement of the tip in the right ventricle. As an alternative to PE tubing, a micromanometer catheter can be used. Gently pulling the distal knot can help introduce the catheter.\nGently push the catheter into the right heart and monitor the depth of advancement according to the mark. Monitor the pressure trace in the software to verify the catheter location and identify the RV pressure (Figure 5).\nKeep the catheter immobile and collect the data (toggle data recording next to the Start button) for 2 min.\nProceed to sample collection (Section 4).\nOpen-chest Approach for RV P-V Loop Analysis.\n\tNote: P-V loop analysis of the right ventricle can't be performed with a closed-chest approach due to the stiffness of the conductance catheter, which does not pass from the SVC to the RA. Commercially available conductance catheters are designed for LV P-V loop analysis.\n\t\nIn the software set Channel 1 for conductance; Channel 2 for pressure; and Channel 3 for heart rate.",
    "Intubate the rats with a 16 G Teflon tube and connect the tube to a mechanical ventilator. Calculate and set the ventilation parameters for mice or rats using the following formulas6: tidal volume (Vt, ml) = 6.2 x M1.01(M = animal mass, kg); respiration rate (RR, min-1) = 53.5 x M-0.26(Figure 6A).\nSpread 70% alcohol onto the fur to reduce the spread of fur onto the surgical field.\nMake an incision below the xyphoid process and bilaterally dissect the skin with scissors towards the flank.\nCut through the abdominal wall and open the abdominal cavity by bilateral dissection along the diaphragm.\nOpen the diaphragm to expose the apex of the heart and bilaterally cut the rib cage (Figure 6A). Prevent evaporation and tissue drying by spraying saline into the thoracic and peritoneal cavities using a syringe.\n\t\tNote: We usually use a dissection scissor to open the abdominal cavity and rib cage. Bleeding is usually not significant, but if there is bleeding, electrocautery can be used.\nCarefully isolate the inferior vena cava (IVC) from the surrounding connective tissue.\nPlace a piece of silk suture (4-0 for rats; 6-0 for mice) around the IVC, and then tie a loose knot (or thread the suture through a 16 G Teflon tube) (Figure 6B).\nPuncture the apical RV free wall with a 27-30 gauge needle parallel to the RV free wall and remove the needle. Be careful not to push the needle in more than 4 mm.\n\t\tNote: Alternatively, a small piece of PE-60 tubing can be used to guide puncture of the conductance catheter into the RV apex.\nInsert the conductance catheter tip through the stab wound on the apical RV free wall until all electrodes are inside the ventricle (Figure 6C).",
    "Monitor the pressure volume loop in the software and then adjust the position of the catheter to obtain consistently shaped loops that do not demonstrate significant respiratory variation (Figure 7B, C).\nRecord baseline P-V loops (toggle data recording next to the Start button) for at least 10 sec to obtain a number of P-V loops.\nPull the suture placed around the IVC to alter the preloads and record the P-V loops. Analyze the data off-line and derive various parameters of RV systolic function (Figure 7D). This analysis has been described previously8.\n\t\tNote: IVC can alternatively be occluded by forceps. Monitor the RV pressure trace to confirm the reduction of preload.\nPerform saline and cuvette calibrations as previously described to allow a conversion from conductance units to volume units6.\nAfter recording the data, gently pull the catheter out and place the tip of the catheter immediately into a water bath with saline. Upon finishing, clean the catheter per manufacturer's instructions.\n4. Collection of Heart and Lung Samples\nNote: As the procedures here are described as terminal, the animal must be euthanized after either closed- or open-chest right heart catheterization.\nEuthanize the mice by opening the thorax (bilateral thoracotomy) if a closed-chest approach was used, exanguination, or by turning off the ventilator after anesthetic overdose.\n\tNote: Cervical dislocation is not recommended.\nTo perform inflation perfusion of the lung, connect the inflation tubing onto a ringstand set to inflate the lung with a pressure of 20 cmH2O (but do not open the valve yet to inflate the lungs).\nBluntly dissect the trachea from surrounding muscle and connective tissue.\nPlace a piece of silk suture (4-0 for rats; 6-0 for mice) around the trachea, and then tie a loose knot.",
    "Gently stretch the trachea by pressing the head and make a cut (70% of circumference) close to the mandible.\nKeep the gentle stretch and insert the tracheal cannula (20 G for mice or 16 G for rats). Secure the cannula using the suture. Connect the cannula onto the inflation tubing and tie the suture around the cannula to prevent the backflow of fixatives.\nFlush the lungs with PBS by using a 10 ml syringe to stab the RV free wall and inject toward the pulmonary artery. Nick the left atrium once the lungs start to blanch.\nHarvest the heart by cutting at the root of the aorta.\nClamp the right lower lobe of lung using a mosquito hemostat and cut the right lower lobe. Place the pieces into microcentrifuge tubes and snap freeze in liquid nitrogen.\nInflate the lung with 10% buffered-neutral formalin for 5 min and remove the trachea cannula followed by ligating the trachea.\nDissect the lung out of the thorax and fix with 10% buffered-neutral formalin.\n\tNote: Alternatively, inflate the lung with optimal cutting media (OCT, diluted 1:1 with PBS) and freeze in undiluted OCT for later preparation of frozen sections.\nCarefully separate the atria from the ventricles and isolate the right ventricle free wall by dissecting alongside the interventricular septum.\nWeigh the RV and LV + septum (LV+S) to calculate a Fulton index (RV/LV+S)9, which quantifies the degree of RV hypertrophy.\n\tNote: TheFulton Index varies in different models of PH. Rat10: control, 0.28 ±0.01; hypoxia-induced, 0.57 ±0.02; MCT-treated, 0.51 ±0.03. C57BL6/J mouse11: control, 0.26 ±0.01; SuHx (14 days), 0.40 ±0.02; SuHx (21 days), 0.43 ±0.01; SuHx (28 days), 0.44 ±0.03.\nSnap freeze the RV and LV+S in liquid nitrogen or fix in 10% buffered-neutral formalin.\nSubscription Required.
