Tamoxifen injection regime to induce adipocyte-specific Atgl gene deletion in AdipoqCreERAtglfl/fl mice (iAAKO)\nd, days; i.p., intraperitoneal.\nCritical: The corn oil tamoxifen solution is quite viscous. Inject slowly and properly tighten the cannula on the syringe.\nMonitor health and maintain documentation over the entire time span of the experiment.\nNote: Please note that this tamoxifen application regime for AdipoqCreER Atglfl/fl mice worked efficiently in our laboratory under the given circumstances and legal framework. Variable tamoxifen dosage and recombination efficiency has been reported in different mouse models, and eventually requires optimization of the tamoxifen protocol in specific CreER and floxed allele mouse lines.\nIsolation of dermal adipocytes\nTiming: 3 h\nThis second step focuses on the isolation of dermal adipocytes, reaching from the living animal to snap frozen adipocytes for later usage. This step of the protocol is modified from Zhang et al., 2019.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nSacrifice the experimental mouse.\nShave the dorsal skin using an electric shaver.",
    "Chemically depilate the dorsal skin with depilatory cream.\nCritical: Limit the time of cream exposure to 1 min to avoid damaging the skin.\nWash the skin with warm water and dry with paper towels.\nClean the depilated skin using 70% ethanol.\nCarefully cut out and excise the total dorsal skin (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3179-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Isolation of dermal adipocytes\n(A) Excision of total dorsal skin.\n(B) Washing of excised dorsal skin in DMEM/F12.\n(C) Coin-sized pieces of dorsal skin floating on top of digestion media with the epidermal side upwards.\n(D) Dissociation of the dermal adipocyte layer into solution.\n(E) Floating dermal adipocytes after centrifugation.\n(F) Dermal adipocytes after removing the infranatant.\nCritical: Avoid subcutaneous adipose tissue and remove visible blood vessels or hairs with tweezers.\nWash the skin twice by placing it in a 50 mL conical tube containing DMEM/F-12 media (37°C) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nCut the skin into large coin-sized pieces, remove any extra tissues attached to the skin, and float the skin on 5 mL digestion-mix in a 6 cm culture dish with the epidermal side up (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nIncubate the floating skin in a 37°C cell incubator for 90–120 min.\nNote: A good indicator for a proceeding enzymatic digestion is the color change of the media from red/pink to yellow/orange. The viscosity of the digestion solution will most likely increase. The digestion can be completed when the dermal adipocyte layer can be dissociated from the dermis without having to use explicit force. Spot check after 90 min in 15 min intervals.\nCarefully remove the skin pieces from the digestion medium and transfer the pieces to a new 6 cm dish containing 3 mL 37°C DMEM/F-12 medium.\nNote: This step as well as the following are to be performed under a sterile culture hood.",
    "Gently dissociate the dWAT layer into the medium using a curved scalpel, being cautious not to disturb the dermis (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nCarefully pipet the cell suspension up and down using a pipette with truncated 1 mL tip.\nNote: Mature adipocytes are prone to rupture when floated in solution. By using a truncated 1 mL pipette tip, we can minimize shear stress on the cells and increase the final yield.\nNote: The size of adipocytes depends on the amount of triglycerides they contain and fluctuates over the course of hair follicle cycling. The physical fragility depends heavily on adipocyte size thus it is assumed that this protocol works best during the telogen phase as this is hallmarked by a small average size of dermal adipocytes and subsequent maximized stability. In our laboratory we were able to successfully apply this protocol on mouse skin during the telogen hair follicle cycle phase and on mouse skin with asynchronized phases of hair follicle cycle phases. In the major reference for this work, Zhang et al.,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] this slightly modified protocol was successfully used to isolate dermal adipocytes during the anagen phase of hair follicle cycling, so we assume that this protocol is applicable independently of the hair follicle cycle.\nFilter the dissociated cells through a 150 μm cell strainer into a new 50 mL conical tube.\nCritical: Use truncated 1 mL pipette tips for transfer and carefully stir the solution by pipetting up and down in between transfers.\nCritical: Wash the cell strainer with 2 mL DMEM/F12 before filtering the cell suspension. Ensure complete wetting of the entire sieve!",
    "Note: This step represents one of the most critical and yield determining steps of this protocol. The cell suspension is viscous and might not wash through the strainer easily. Work fast but handle the suspension with care. Continuously rinse through the strainer with fresh DMEM/F12 but do not exceed the volume of 15 mL.\nCarefully transfer the cell mixture into a new 15 mL conical tube using truncated 1 mL pipette tips.\nCentrifuge the tube at 600 × g for 5 min at 37°C. Dermal adipocytes will float on top of the medium as a white layer.\nNote: It is to be expected that some free lipid will also be included in this layer, but this does not pose a major issue in small quantities.\nCarefully transfer the floating dermal adipocytes to a 2 mL tube using a truncated 1 mL pipette tip.\nCritical: Hold the pipette vertical and only insert the tip 1–2 mm lower than the lipid/adipocyte layer. Take up only a small volume at a time.\nCritical: The fluid level in the 2 mL tube must not reach the lid when centrifuging in the next step so do not fill up the whole 2 mL.\nCentrifuge at 200 × g at 37°C for 2 min (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nRemove the underlying medium using a pipette with thin tip (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nSnap freeze the dermal adipocytes for future use or immediately proceed with major step three of this protocol for protein isolation.\nIsolation of protein from isolated dermal adipocytes\nTiming: 2 h\nThe third segment of this protocol describes the isolation of water-soluble proteins from the freshly isolated dermal adipocytes using the ‘Minute TOTAL Protein Extraction Kit for Adipose Tissue/Cultured Adipocytes’ with an adapted protocol.\nCool down centrifuge to 4°C.\nThaw the previously frozen dermal adipocyte samples at 4°C.",
    "Prepare protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor mix in buffer A (provided by the Minute TOTAL Protein Extraction Kit for Adipose Tissue/Cultured Adipocytes):\nProtease inhibitor cocktail: dilute 1:100.\nPhosphatase inhibitor tablets: dissolve 1 tablet in 10 mL.\nAdd 250 μL of the enzyme inhibitor mix prepared in step 27 to the thawed dermal adipocyte sample and homogenate for 3 min at 30 Hz using the MixerMill system.\nCritical: For homogenization using MixerMill, use one stainless steel body per sample/tube.\nCentrifuge at 350 × g at 4°C for 2 min and transfer the supernatant to a kit provided pre-chilled −20°C filter cartridge with a collection tube.\nIncubate the filter cartridge with the cap open at −20°C for 15–20 min.\nCritical: Ensure precise incubation to decisively separate the lipid and aqueous fractions. This timing likely varies even between different freezer units but the technical notes provided in the manual of the protein extraction kit[href=https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0063/4575/2687/files/22-AT-022_v10.pdf?v=1650999022] can help pinpoint this time point.\nAfter incubation, immediately centrifuge at 350 × g for 2 min at 4°C with the cap open. The flow-through contains total proteins from dermal adipocytes.\nPerform BCA analysis to determine protein concentration.\nPrepare protein standards according to BCA datasheet.\nPrepare working reagent by mixing 50 parts of reagent A with 1 part of reagent B.\nPipette 25 μL of each standard and sample into a 96-well plate.\nAdd 200 μL of working reagent and mix gently.\nIncubate for 30 min at 37°C.\nCool plate to 18°C–25°C.\nMeasure absorbance at 570 nm on a plate reader.\nAdd 1/10 of buffer B provided by the Minute TOTAL Protein Extraction Kit for Adipose Tissue/Cultured Adipocytes to the protein solution resulting in a denatured protein solution.\nNote: Do not add buffer B if your downstream applications involve ELISA or immune precipitation.\nGel electrophoresis and western blotting",
    "Timing: 2 days\nAdd LDS Sample buffer 1:4 to the sample volume for loading.\nAdd 4% β-mercaptoethanol to the sample.\nHeat up for 10 min at 75°C.\nCool on ice and spin down at 4°C to collect evaporated fluid.\nFreeze sample at −80°C or continue with SDS-PAGE.\nCentrifuge 25 min at 4°C maximum speed to remove cell debris.\nCritical: This centrifugation step will most likely result in the formation of a pellet and potentially even a small lipid layer on top of the solution. Avoid both when drawing up sample with your pipette.\nPrepare 4%–12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gel by removing the white stripe.\nPrepare 500 mL of SDS running buffer.\nPut gel into the device and completely fill the Upper-Buffer-Chamber with SDS running buffer. Fill the rest of the buffer into the Lower-Buffer-Chamber.\nRemove the comb and wash pockets with SDS running buffer.\nLoad 20 μg protein in up to 40 μL sample per lane.\nLoad 10 μL of protein ladder.\nRun gel at 130 V for approximately 70 min. The 10 kDa band should be at the lower edge of the gel.\nSoak 4 sponges and 8 sheets of filter paper in transfer buffer.\nActivate PVDF-membrane in methanol (15–60 s) and soak in transfer buffer.\nPut into the blotting chamber:\n2 Sponges.\n4 Filters.\nGel.\nMembrane.\n4 Filters.\n2 Sponges.\nCritical: Make sure there are no bubbles, wear gloves and handle the membrane with forceps.\nClose blotting chamber, put it into the device and fill the blotting chamber with transfer buffer. Put device into a box with ice and fill the Lower-Buffer-Chamber with ice.\nBlot for 105 min at 30 V.\nAfter blotting, perform Ponceau staining of the membrane (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3179-Fig3.jpg",
    "Figure 3. Western blot analysis of ATGL and β-actin in dermal adipocytes isolated from tamoxifen-treated Atglfl/fl mice (control) and tamoxifen-treated AdipoqCreERAtglfl/fl mice (iAAKO)\nThe figure shows successful isolation of proteins from dermal adipocytes and efficient ATGL deletion in iAAKO mice compared to controls.\nImmerse the membrane in Ponceau-staining-solution and stain for 5 min.\nRinse membrane with distilled water until the background is clear.\nIf required, cut membrane into stripes to detect different sized proteins.\nNote: Cutting the membrane is optional. In this protocol, we cut the membrane at ∼ 50 kDa to allow simultaneous detection of ATGL (∼ 54 kDa) and β-actin (∼ 42 kDa).\nIncubate in 5% milk in TBST (blocking solution) for 1 h at 18°C–25°C or for 14 h at 4°C with shaking.\nIncubate membrane with primary antibody according to manufacturer's instructions in blocking solution for 2 h at 18°C–25°C or 14 h at 4°C with shaking:\nUpper part of membrane (> 50 kDa): ATGL (1:2000).\nLower part of membrane (< 50 kDa): β-actin (1:2000).\nNote: The ATGL antibody here is used to validate the gene knock-out. To verify the adipocyte identity of the sample we suggest the use of a control marker for adipocytes such as adiponectin, perilipin-1 or FABP4. To probe for potential presence of stomal vascular cells in the sample we suggest the control markers CD45, CD31, CD34 and vimentin.\nWash membrane 3 × 10 min with TBST at 18°C–25°C.\nIncubate membrane with secondary antibody in blocking solution for 1 h at 18°C–25°C:\nUpper part of membrane (> 50 kDa): swine anti-rabbit HRP (1:2000).\nLower part of membrane (< 50 kDa): goat anti-mouse HRP (1:2000).\nWash membrane 1 × 15 min and 3 × 10 min with TBST at 18°C–25°C.\nPrepare 1 mL of ECL solution by mixing 500 μL of each solution.",
    "Critical: Use different pipette tips for each solution.\nTransfer membrane onto a clean surface (e.g., plastic foil).\nPipette ECL solution onto the membrane, distribute evenly and incubate for 1 min.\nWrap the membrane into a clean plastic bag and fixate it into the film-cassette.\nNote: Remove excessive ECL solution.\nDetect the HRP-generated signal by applying a CL-XPosure Film on the membrane for 10 s to 30 min.\nCritical: Protect the undeveloped film from light.\nDevelop the film using a Curix 60 X-ray development machine (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nDraw protein ladder bands onto the film, before removing the membrane from the film-cassette.\nNote: The membrane can be air dried and stored at −20°C for later repeated use."
