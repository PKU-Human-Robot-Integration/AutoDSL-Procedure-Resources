    "All procedures described in this protocol have been performed in accordance with guidelines and regulations for the use of vertebrate animals, including prior approval by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Generating Fluorescently Labeled Mouse Model and Tumor Cells\nPrepare 100 ml of 0.1 % (w/v) bovine serum albumin/phosphate buffered saline (BSA/PBS) buffer by mixing 0.1 g of BSA with 100 ml of PBS.\nPrepare fluorescently labeled tumor cells by stable transfection.\n\tNOTE: Here we use E0771-LG cells, a highly metastatic derivative of E0771 mouse mammary adenocarcinoma cells 37 that were isolated from metastatic tumors developed in the lung of C57BL/6 mouse intravenously injected with parental E0771 cells 38.\n\t\n24 hr before transfection, plate 1 x 105 EO771-LG cells on a 60 mm tissue culture dish on 2 ml of antibiotic free 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum) DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium) and incubate at 37 °C and 5 % CO2.\nAt the time of transfection, incubate 2 µg of the fluorescent protein vector with 10 µl of transfection reagent for 30 min before adding 190 µl of reduced serum media.\nWash EO771-LG cells with Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (D-PBS) once and add the transfection mix gently.\nIncubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 6 hr.\nWash the transfected cells and culture in 2 ml of complete DMEM (10% FBS, 1mM pyruvate, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin) for 2 days.\nWash cells with 2 ml of sterile PBS, add 500 µl of 0.25 % trypsin-EDTA and incubate for 2 min at 37 °C.\nCollect cell suspension and mix with at least 1 volume of complete DMEM and spin down at 280 x g.",
    "Resuspend the cells in 1 ml of complete DMEM and expand the cell culture into a 10 cm tissue culture dish.\nStart selection of transfected cells by adding 700 µg/ml of G418 selective antibiotic to 8 ml of complete DMEM and culture for a week, changing medium every three days.\nEnrich the fluorescent population from transfected cells that have been under selection in G418 by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) 39,40.\n\t\nWash cells with 5 ml of PBS and add 1.5 ml of 0.25% trypsin.\nIncubate for 2 min at 37 °C and mix with at least one volume of complete DMEM.\nCollect cell suspension and spin down at 280 x g and re-suspend cells in 1 mL of sterile 0.1 % (w/v) BSA/PBS buffer.\nFilter the cell suspension through a 40 µm mesh and adjust the volume to 1 ml with 0.1 % BSA/PBS buffer for sorting.\nFACS-sort the 10% brightest population based on fluorescence spectrum using the FACS sorter 41.\nCulture the sorted cells for another week under selection (700 µg/ml G418 in complete DMEM).\nReselect fluorescently labeled cells by flow cytometry by repeating steps 1.3.1 to 1.3.6 once again.\nAfter a second round of selection, trypsinize, filter and re-suspend cells in 0.1% BSA/PBS as described (steps 1.3.1-1.3.4). Adjust concentration to 2 x 106 cells/ml for single cell sorting into 96 well plates using the FACS sorter.\nPrepare 3-5 96 well plates with 100 µl of full DMEM for collection. To improve survival after sorting, add 100 µl of filtered culture medium from dishes where the EO771-LG cells were grown 42.\nAfter sorting the cells into the 96-well plates, return cells to culture for 2 days (37 °C, 5% CO2).\nIdentify wells with viable single clones by examination under an inverted microscope at 5x magnification.",
    "Trypsinize and expand viable clones and freeze cells for backup.\n\t\t\nWash wells with growing clones with 100 µl of sterile PBS. Add 50 µl of 0.25% w/v trypsin and incubate 2 min at 37 °C. Add 50 µl of complete DMEM and transfer to sterile V-bottom or round bottom 96-well plate to spin down at 280 x g for 5 min.\nResuspend cells in 100 µl of 700 µg/ml G418 complete DMEM and plate each clone in 12-well plates. Add 400 µl of complete DMEM with G418 and culture until confluent.\nWash wells with 500 µl of PBS, add 100 µl of 0.25% trypsin and incubate 2 min at 37 °C. Add 100 µl of complete DMEM and spin down for 5 min at 280 x g. Resuspend cells in 100 ul of complete DMEM with G418 and plate cells in 6 well plates until confluent.\nOnce confluent, trypsinize cells, spin down and resuspend in 10% DMSO in FBS to freeze cell stocks.\nKeep 1/10 of the cell suspensions in culture by plating them in 100 mm tissue culture dishes for evaluation of their metastatic potential.\nTest metastatic potential of selected clones.\n\t\nTrypsinize and re-suspend cells in saline to a concentration of 2.5 x 106 cells/ml and inject 200 µl into C57BL/6 mice intravenously through the tail vein.\nAfter 2 weeks, collect lung tissue as previously described 23 and quantify tumor burden by surface count or stereological method 43. Select clones with high metastatic potential for intravital imaging.\nRaise MacBlue (a myeloid specific promoter driving cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) expression (Csf1r-GAL4VP16/UAS-ECFP16)) reporter mice 44.\n\tNOTE: Typically, mice between 8 and 12 weeks are used, but mice as early as 7 and as late as 20 weeks have been tested to work as well.",
    "2. Multiphoton Microscope Set up and Imaging Preparation\nNOTE: While this protocol can be performed on any multiphoton microscope, the system used to acquire the data shown in this protocol has been described previously in detail 45.\nTurn on all microscope and laser components including two-photon lasers and the detectors at least one hour ahead of the desired imaging time.\nJust before surgery, measure the power of the light input to the microscope by placing the head of the optical power meter in the beam path just before the microscope and adjust the laser end cavity mirror knobs until the maximum light intensity at 880 nm is read on the optical power meter.\n3. Vacuum System Set up\nGlue the coverslip into the imaging window (Supplemental Figure 1) with cyanoacrylate. Allow at least 4 hr for the glue to completely dry.\n\tNOTE: This step may also be done ahead of time.\nCut the 100 µl pipette tip at the first line from the small opening and connect the uncut end to the thin vacuum hose.\nConnect the vacuum system according to Figure 1 and Supplemental Figure 2.\nWith the vacuum on and the open end blocked, adjust the vacuum regulator for <3 inHg.\n\tNOTE: Final adjustment of the vacuum level will be performed by observation of the vasculature in vivo.\nApply a thin film of petroleum grease to the underside of the imaging plate to prevent the objective lens immersion medium from being wicked away by the imaging plate.\nPlace the imaging plate on the microscope stage.\n\tNOTE: The custom imaging plate (Supplemental Figure 3) is a sheet of 1/8\" thick aluminum machined both to fit in the stage insert space and with a through-hole in the center for holding the imaging window.",
    "Insert the vacuum window into the imaging plate with the coverslip down.\nSterilize all surfaces and instruments including imaging stage plate, and imaging window with 70% ethanol.\nConnect the cut end of the pipette tip to the vacuum window and tape the hose down to the imaging plate.\nBring the objective close to the imaging window and place a large drop of water between the objective and the coverslip.\nEnsure that there are no leaks from the coverslip by blocking the central opening of the vacuum window and verifying that the water drop between the objective and coverslip does not get aspirated.\n\tNOTE: An old style computer mouse ball placed over the window is useful for blocking the central opening.\n4. Surgery\nPrepare the sterile surgical area.\n\t\nPlace all instruments within easy reach. Sterilize all surfaces and instruments including surgical area, and surgical tools with 70% ethanol.\nTie a 3 inch length of 2-0 suture to the catheter, ¼ inch above the bushing with a double knot.\nPrepare tail vein catheter following the published protocol by Harney et al. 46.\nUsing an infrared (IR) heat lamp, warm the animal in its cage for ~5 min to increase the blood flow in the tail vein and to aid in catheter insertion. It is recommended to keep the animal warmed to physiological temperatures throughout the surgical procedure using either a heat lamp or a warming pad.\nAnesthetize the animal with 5% isoflurane and verify that there is no response to a toe pinch.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes of the animal.\nApply depilatory lotion for 10-30 sec to remove hair from the left side of the animal; from the midline of the chest to ¼ of the back and from the axilla to just under the ribcage.",
    "Clean any excess lotion and sterilize exposed skin with 70% alcohol.\nAttach a sterile syringe filled with PBS to the tail vein catheter and insert and tape in place following the published protocol by Harney et al. 46. Make sure the tape is securely adhered to the needle itself and is not free in the gap between the tail and the tape.\nIntubate the mouse following either the published protocol by Das et al. 47 or by DuPage et al. 48\nTurn on the ventilator and set it to supply 135 breaths per min and 200 µl of isoflurane-oxygen mixture.\nConnect the tracheal catheter to the ventilator.\nMove the mouse to the surgical area. Take extreme care not to dislodge the catheter.\nTie the 2-0 suture around the snout of the mouse under the front teeth.\nTape the catheter to the snout.\nTape the left forelimb to the catheter to keep it out of the surgical field.\nLower the isoflurane anesthesia to a maintenance level of 2.5% and verify there is no response to a toe pinch.\nUsing the sharp scissors, remove 1 cm2 of skin above the left chest wall.\nLift the mammary fat pad and cauterize any exposed blood vessels with the cautery pen.\nResect the fat pad by cutting with the sharp scissors.\nRemove the muscle layer down to the rib cage by cutting with the sharp scissors. Take care not to cut the axillary vein running at the base of the forelimb.\nUse forceps to grab and lift the 6th rib. Using the sharp scissors held at a shallow angle (~5°) cut the rib near the edge of the opening in skin. Take extreme care not to touch the exposed lung tissue.",
    "Widen the opening in the chest wall to expose the entire lung lobe by removing four consecutive ribs.\n\tNote: Keep the opening at least 5 mm away from the sternum to avoid the heart.\nCarefully lift the mouse by grasping the tail and tracheal catheter and move the mouse to the microscope imaging stage.\nWith the vacuum off, fill the chamber of the vacuum window with PBS.\nInvert the mouse and position the exposed lung over the vacuum imaging window.\nSlowly turn on the vacuum to approximately 3-5 inches of mercury using the ball valve.\nPlace a restraining harness made of tissue paper folded in half twice over the chest of the mouse and tape to the stage plate as shown in Supplemental Figure 2.\nClip the thigh sensor of the pulse oximeter to the animal's upper thigh and start the software.\nPlace the environmental chamber on the stage and turn on the heat to maintain the mouse at a physiological temperature.\nReduce the level of isoflurane to 1-1.5 % to maintain anesthesia and maintain blood flow.\n5. Intravital Imaging\nBring the 25 x 0.95 numerical aperture (NA) objective lens near to the coverslip and add a large drop of water between them.\nUsing epifluorescence mode, view the FITC channel and bring the lung tissue into focus.\nIf not done prior to the surgery, inject tumor cells through the tail vein catheter.\n\t\nDisconnect the PBS syringe from the tail vein catheter.\nLoad a sterile syringe with 100 µl of tumor cell suspension (2 x 107 cells/ml in PBS maximum).\n\t\tNOTE: This step can be done in advance to study cancer cell arrival to the lung at different time points.\nConnect the syringe with tumor cells onto the tail vein catheter.\nSlowly inject the tumor cells into the tail vein.",
    "Disconnect the syringe with the tumor cells from the tail vein catheter.\nReconnect the PBS syringe to the tail vein catheter.\n\t\tNOTE: Identify the locations of all of the tumor cells before injecting the dextran as it becomes difficult to distinguish the tumor cells from the dextran signal via the ocular after injection.\nLocate tumor cells to image\n\t\nFor imaging individual tumor cells, locate all tumor cells and record their locations with the multipoint panel of the software.\n\t\t\nLocate all fields of view to image by observing the tumor cells in the microscope ocular.\nIn the software, switch to the multipoint panel by clicking on the Multi-Point button and store the location of the cell by clicking on the Add Position button.\nFor mosaic imaging, locate the origin of the mosaic and set the imaging coordinates\n\t\t\nLocate a position in the top left corner of the structure to be captured.\nZero the x, y and z coordinates of the stage by pushing the \"Zero\" button on the stage controller.\nLoad up the appropriate list of mosaic coordinates by clicking on the \"Load\" button and selecting the list.\n\t\t\tNOTE: An example list for a 2 x 2 mosaic with a 20% overlap of a 500 µm field of view would be: Pos.1 = (0,0), Pos. 2 = (400,0), Pos. 3 = (0,400), Pos. 4 = (400,400).\nRemove the syringe with PBS in the tail vein catheter and replace with the syringe containing the dextran.",
    "Slowly inject up to 100 µl of 20 mg / ml 155 kDa rhodamine-dextran dissolved in PBS into the mouse via the tail vein catheter followed by injecting 50 µl of sterile PBS to flush the line. Do not introduce any bubbles into the line. When necessary, inject dextran at least one hour after cancer cell injection so that the total volume administered to the mouse does not exceed 4 ml/Kg/hr.\nSet up imaging parameters.\n\t\nSwitch the microscope to multiphoton mode.\nSet the zoom to a factor of 2X by clicking on the Timing Signals button and updating the Zoom Factor field.\nAdjust the laser power to ~10 % (~10-15 mW at the sample) by clicking the Detectors and Laser button and then adjusting the Tsunami Power slider to 10.\nImage each location to verify the presence of tumor cells and visualize the flow and integrity of the vasculature.\n\tNOTE: Vessels should appear fully perfused with flowing erythrocytes and fluorescent dextran should be contained within the vessels without leakage to the extravascular spaces. Approximately 10 - 20 tumor cells are expected to be within the clear aperture of the vacuum window.\nAdjust the starting depth of each location to be imaged.\n\t\nFor each location, adjust the z position by rotating the focus knob on the stage controller to image the top slice of the tumor cell.\nPosition the cell in the center of the field of view.\nClick on the Multipoint button, click on the position of the field of view to highlight it and click the Add followed by the Delete button to replace the cell's stored position in the multipoint list.\nVisually observe the relative brightness of the tumor cell in each position.",
    "Save the new locations of each of the cells by clicking on the Save button in the Multipoint panel and specify a filename.\nFor imaging of individual tumor cells, pick three cells of approximately equivalent brightness and delete all other locations from the multipoint list by clicking on their location in the list and then clicking on the Delete button.\nClick on the Detectors and Laser button and adjust the sliders for the PMT gain of the green and red channels 45 so that the signals are below saturation.\nAdjust the slider for the blue channel 45 so that macrophages appear cyan.\n\tNOTE: Any second harmonic signal will appear only in the blue channel and can be separated from the cyan macrophages by following the channel subtraction procedure previously described 45.\nSet the z-stack start depth to 0 µm and the end depth to 24 µm by moving the z stage to the location and clicking on the Start and End buttons respectively.\n\tNOTE: Cells within this depth will be visualized with the best signal to noise and resolution.\nSet the z step size to 3 µm.\nSet the imaging parameters following parameters previously described 45,49.\n\t\nFor imaging of individual tumor cells, click the Timing Signals button and then enter 4 V into the zoom factor field (equivalent to a zoom factor of 1.5X), enter 3 into the frame averages field and click on Time-Lapse button and enter 10 into the Time-lapse field.\n\t\tNOTE: These settings will acquire 1 frame every 3 sec.\nFor mosaic imaging, click the Timing Signals button and enter a zoom factor of 1.5 V (equivalent to a zoom factor of 4X), enter 3 in the number of frame averages and click on the Time-Lapse button and enter 10 into the time-lapse time delay field.",
    "NOTE: These settings will acquire 1 frame every 3 sec.\nEnable the multipoint, z-stack and t-lapse imaging modes by clicking on their buttons.\nPress the Record button to acquire images.\n\tNOTE: Lung tissue is very delicate and susceptible to photo-damage. If after time lapse imaging blood flow stops in the imaged field, the laser is most likely too high and subsequent imaging of other fields must be done at lower power.\nEvery 30-45 min, slowly inject 50 µl of PBS or saline to maintain hydration of the animal.\n6. Euthanasia\nIncrease the isoflurane to 5%.\nKeep the animal under 5% isoflurane until 30 sec after it ceases to breathe and remove the animal from the stage.\nPerform cervical dislocation to ensure complete euthanasia.\n7. Image Analysis\nFor single cell imaging experiments:\n\t\nLoad images into Fiji and format them as a Hyperstack.\nFor each z-slice in the Hyperstack, play the time lapse movie and look for residual x-y movement. If residual x-y movement is found, apply the plugin called StackReg 36 to the stack to eliminate the movement.\nFor mosaic imaging experiments:\nLoad images into Fiji and stitch them together by opening the Mosaic Stitching macro (Supplemental code file Mosaic Stitching) and entering information about the images such as the directory, the file base name, the number of x and y fields in the mosaic and the number of slices and time points.\n\tNOTE: Due to how Java interprets directories, folder names must have two backslashes as subfolder separators. Due to limitations in the built-in plugin Pairwise Stitching, base file names must not contain any dashes.",
    "To obtain a clear view of the boundaries of the vasculature, average together all of the time points for the blood channel into a single image and then replicate this image as the background for each frame of the movie of the other channels.\n\tNOTE: This is done by simply running the Perform Blood Averaging macro (Supplemental code file Perform Blood Averaging).\nSubscription Required.
