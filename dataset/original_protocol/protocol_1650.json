    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nThe biotin ChIP-seq protocol steps are reviewed in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/121-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. The Biotin ChIP-Seq Protocol Overview\nEmbryo Preparation (Day 1)\nTiming: Variable depending on species and required animal number\nEmbryos harboring biotinylated POI in desired cells are collected and processed as required prior to their dissociation into single cell suspension.\nZebrafish\nCollect transgenic zebrafish embryos/larvae expressing both AVI-tagged DNA-binding factor of interest and nuclear BirA within same embryos in batches of 50 embryos/larvae. Include negative controls expressing BirA only when optimizing your system to determine the background noise of the assay. If using larvae anesthetize them using MS-222. Dechorionate embryos if applicable.\nTransfer to 1.7 mL low binding Eppendorf tubes (50 embryos/larvae per tube).\nRemove as much E3 solution as possible.\nWash 2× with 1× PBS and remove PBS.\nAdd 1 mL of isotonic nuclei extraction buffer (NEB) to each tube of 50 embryos/larvae.\nChicken\nAt the desired stage, remove embryos from the egg and carefully dissect away the remaining vitelline membrane. In case of ex ovo electroporation, remove the embryo from the filter paper.\nWith micro-dissecting scissors, dissect region(s) of interest and transfer dissected tissue to a 1.7 mL low binding Eppendorf tube (10–15 embryos/tube). If dissecting a large number of embryos, use multiple collection tubes to keep the amount of material crosslinked in each tube consistent and ensure the same fixation penetrance and crosslinking outcome. This approach also allows amassing material over several collection rounds (necessary as chick electroporation experiments are medium throughput), thus reducing batch effects and fluctuations in embryo survival and quality of collected material.\nBriefly spin the Eppendorf tube and remove as much Ringer’s solution as possible.\nWash 2× with 1× PBS, briefly spin and remove PBS.",
    "Add 1 mL of isotonic nuclei extraction buffer (NEB) to the tube.\nNote For Chicken: multiple tubes of dissected tissue can be pooled at this point by sequentially resuspending samples in 1 mL NEB.\nCell Dissociation and Fixation (Day 1)\nTiming: 1 h\nCollected embryos/dissected tissue are dissociated into a single cell suspension followed by cell fixation to crosslink the chromatin with all DNA bound proteins, including biotinylated POI.\nTransfer all embryos in NEB into a pre-chilled Dounce homogenizer tube on ice.\nNote: if more than one tube was used, at this point all material is combined into a 7 mL Dounce homogenizer tube (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). If 2 mL Dounce homogenizer tube is used, perform homogenization of each 1 mL sample sequentially.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/121-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Embryo Homogenization and Material Transfer\n(A) Collect 50 zebrafish embryos (or if this homogenization method is used, 10–15 chicken embryos) per tube. When PBS is replaced with 1 mL of nuclei extraction buffer in each tube, transfer all the material from the microfuge tubes into a Dounce homogenizer.\n(B) Pestle A is used to homogenize embryos.\n(C) Once material is homogenized, transfer homogenate into the same number of tubes as started with in (A) – 973 μL of homogenate into each tube.\nHomogenize embryos with 20 strokes using the large clearance pestle A for initial homogenization (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nNote For Zebrafish: for 3 days post fertilization (dpf) or older zebrafish larvae use 26 strokes and strain homogenized material with a 100 μm strainer to remove unhomogenized hard structures.",
    "Note For Chicken: For chicken embryos, this step can be skipped since tissues are generally more fragile and can easily be dissociated with gentle pipetting with a low binding 1 mL pipette tip the embryos in the solution on ice to break up the tissue, avoiding cavitation.\nPipette 973 μL of homogenate into a fresh 1.7 mL tube.\nNote: use P1000 Reach tips for material transfer.\nNote: If 7 mL Dounce homogenizer tube was used, at this point sample material is separated into multiple Eppendorf tubes again (e.g. if started with three tubes with 50 embryos per each tube, divide material into three tubes again) (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nNote For Chicken: This step can be skipped if tissues broken up successfully with the pipette.\nAdd 27 μL of 37% formaldehyde (Final concentration of 1%) to each tube.\nCritical: Percentage of formaldehyde requires optimization to allow all material to be crosslinked and sonicated adequately. See Optimization section for more details.\nThoroughly mix the contents by inverting all tubes and place on the nutator at 20°C–25°C for 10 min.\nNote: Time of fixing can also be optimized but generally we optimize the concentration of formaldehyde as opposed to time of crosslinking.\nAdd 143 μL of 1 M glycine (final 125 mM) and immediately mix by inverting the tube a few times. Place on the nutator for 5 min to quench the crosslinker.\nCentrifuge at 2,000 × g at 4°C for 4 min to pellet the crosslinked cells.\nAfter spinning, the crosslinked cells are pelleted. Remove supernatant which contains formaldehyde and safely dispose the waste.\nNote: Remove liquid gently as the pellet can be dislodged from the tube wall.\nNote: We recommend using Art P1000 Reach tips from this step onwards for this section.",
    "Resuspend and wash the cell pellet by gentle slow pipetting with 1 mL of PBS/PIs. Spin at 2,000 × g for 4 min at 4°C and discard supernatant. Repeat three times.\nNote: The cell pellet will progressively become more transparent macroscopically as the fixative is washed out.\nDiscard all but ~100 μL of the supernatant then spin at 2,000 × g for 4 min at 4°C, before removing the final 100 μL of supernatant. This helps to minimize sample loss as a significant amount can be spread along the wall of the microcentrifuge tube.\nPause Point: At this point cell pellets can be snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80°C for up to 6 months for future use or until all the required material is collected. For high-resolution biotin ChIP-seq, at least 100,000–150,000 cells of interest are required.\nNuclei Expulsion, Lysis and Chromatin Fragmentation: (Day 2)\nTiming: 2–3 h depending on sonication parameters\nNuclei are expulsed from cells and then lysed in order to release chromatin with the crosslinked proteins. Chromatin is then sonicated into 300–800 bp size DNA fragments compatible with the ChIP library preparation and Illumina Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) platforms.\nNote: If after the crosslinking step you had more than 3 tubes (reminder: 50 of zebrafish or 10–15 of chicken embryos per each tube) of crosslinked material due to a large number of embryos required to gather 100,000–150,000 cells of interest, combine multiple tube material into maximum of 2–3 tubes (50,000–70,000 cells of interest per tube) at this step. To achieve this, use same 1 mL of NEB to resuspend multiple tube pellets (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/121-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Combing Material from Multiple Tubes into a Single Tube",
    "Add 1 mL fresh NEB to the first pellet and resuspend thoroughly by pipetting gently. Transfer this NEB containing resuspended material into the next tube and repeat one more time. The final tube contains combined material. Make sure you have only 2 or 3 tubes for the next protocol steps.\nThoroughly resuspend pellet in each tube (fresh or frozen) in 1 mL nuclei extraction buffer (NEB) and transfer all material to the pre-chilled Dounce tube on ice (same material transfer strategy as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nExpulse nuclei with 20 strokes using pestle B keeping the Dounce tube on ice. This will disrupt the cellular walls and help expulse the nuclei into the solution.\nNote For Chicken: pipetting with a 1 mL low binding pipette tip is sufficient.\nTransfer the eluate into two or three 1.7 mL Eppendorf tube (same material transfer strategy as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). Spin for 1 min at maximum speed at 4°C and gently remove the supernatant (pellet is still visible but easily dislodged).\nWash the pellet with 1 mL ice cold PBS/PIs, avoiding cavitation. Centrifuge for 1 min at maximum speed at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nOn ice, resuspend the pellet in 120 μL of 20°C–25°C SDS Lysis Buffer Stock, then add 5 μL of 25× Protease inhibitor stock. Pipet up and down to release the crosslinked chromatin into the solution and allow to lie on ice for 10–15 min.\nNote: Lay the tubes horizontally slightly pushed on top of ice (i.e. bottom and upper part of the tube at the same level lightly submerged in ice).\nAdd 300 μL of final ChIP dilution buffer w/o Triton to stop the lysis. The final volume is now 425 μL (~0.2% SDS).",
    "For chromatin sonication, we use Misonix Sonicator 4000 with Microtip. The sample should be kept in an ice/water bath throughout the sonication process to avoid overheating and cavitation.\nCritical: Make sure to first optimize sonication parameters to acquire sheared chromatin fragments of approximately ~200–800 bp, with average ~300 bp (see Optimization section for more details). Our laboratory standard parameters are: 10 cycles of 12A 10s ON - 30s OFF pulses followed by 4 cycles of 8A 30s ON - 30s OFF pulses.\nNote: Make sure the tip of the sonicator is in the center of the solution and does not touch the tube to avoid ineffective sonication.\nRight after sonication of each sample, add 42.5 μL of 10% Triton X-100 to 425 μL of sonicated chromatin. Keep tubes on ice until sonication is completed for all tubes.\nCentrifuge the sonicated material at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Transfer the supernatant (~400 μL) to a fresh new microfuge tube and set aside on ice, leaving ~50 μL at the bottom of the tube (containing mostly SDS non-soluble protein complexes).\nNote: if started with three tubes on day 2, divide the third tube content by transferring 200 μL into the new first tube and another 200 μL into the second new tube.\nAdd 400 μL of ChIP dilution buffer w/Triton to each 50 μL pellet that remained in the old tubes and mix the contents to extract leftover chromatin. Re-spin at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Transfer and re-unite ~400 μL (all but last 50 μL of the supernatant) to the sonicated chromatin set aside after the first spin.",
    "Note: if started with three tubes, again divide the third tube content by transferring 200 μL into the new first tube and another 200 μL into the second new tube. After this step you should have only two tubes for each ChIP sample (~800 μL in each tube if on day 2 started with 2 tubes or ~1,200 μL in each tube if on day 2 started with 3 tubes).\nVortex and briefly spin the blocked Protein G beads (2 tubes for each ChIP sample). Place in the magnetic stand for 3 min, and then completely remove the block using a P10 tip if necessary.\nNote: The bead separation and washing steps should be performed using P1000 Reach tips.\nAdd the sonicated chromatin (2× ~800 μL or 2× ~1,200 μL) into 2× tubes containing prepared protein G beads. Incubate the mixture on the rotisserie at 4°C (cold room) for 1 h. This pre-clearing step removes proteins that bind non-specifically to the bead matrix.\nChromatin Precipitation (Day 2)\nTiming: 10 min followed by 12–16 h incubation\nBiotinylated proteins and their bound DNA fragments are specifically captured onto streptavidin beads by an over-night incubation.\nBriefly spin the sheared chromatin samples containing Protein G beads (allow the microcentrifuge to reach 2,000 × g at 4°C, then stop), and place on magnetic stand for 1–2 min.\nTransfer 2× 800 μL or 2× 1,200 μL of supernatant containing the sheared chromatin into two new low binding pre-cooled microcentrifuge tubes.",
    "Save an aliquot of cell lysate from each chromatin sample as an input fraction - 1/20 of biotin ChIP-ed chromatin. We recommend to split this fraction into two tubes of equal volumes to ease later handling steps, i.e. 2 × 40 μL if total is 2 × 800 μL or 2 × 60 μL if total is 2 × 1,200 μL. Place input fractions in screw cap tubes (or a snap-lock cap tube if preferred) and keep at −80°C until the un-crosslinking step.\nDiscard the Protein G beads.\nVortex and briefly spin the blocked streptavidin beads (2 tubes for each ChIP sample). Place on magnetic stand for 1–2 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the beads in 50 μL of blocking solution (1× PBS/0.5% BSA).\nAdd beads to both sheared chromatin sample tubes and incubate for 12–16 h on the rotisserie in the cold room.\nNote: make sure the tubes are tightly closed; you can wrap the tubes in parafilm.\nWash, Elution and Crosslink Reversal (Day 3)\nTiming: 30–40 min followed by 12–16 h incubation\nNon-biotinylated proteins and non-bound DNA are washed away from the biotinylated proteins crosslinked to their target DNA fragments, which are captured on streptavidin beads. These biotinylated complexes are then eluted from the streptavidin beads and protein-DNA crosslinking is reversed in order to release DNA fragments from the biotinylated POIs.\nNote: SDS washes should be performed at 20°C–25°C, otherwise SDS will precipitate. Subsequent RIPA washes should be performed at 4°C in a cold room.\nNote: The bead separation and washing steps should be performed using P1000 Reach tips.\nBriefly centrifuge samples and place on magnetic stand for 1–2 min to collect the beads. Remove and discard as much of the supernatant as possible, using a 10 μL tip if needed.",
    "Note: removing as much supernatant as possible helps to reduce background.\nAdd 1.5 mL of SDS Wash Buffer (2% SDS in TE – 10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA). Remove tubes from magnetic stand and tap them gently to resuspend beads. Leave tubes on the nutator for 1 min for a more efficient wash. Place tubes in magnetic stand to collect beads for 2 min. Remove supernatant. Repeat twice.\nRIPA washes: transfer 1.5 mL RIPA into tubes at 20°C–25°C, put tubes on ice and go to the cold room to perform 4 washes: 2 min on the rotisserie followed by 3 min incubation on the magnetic rack. Each time carefully discard the supernatant.\nNote: Prepare new screw cap tubes for the post-washing ChIP sample (2 tubes for each sample), on ice.\nAfter RIPA washes, wash samples once with 1.5 mL TE that contains 50 mM NaCl (STE): 3 min on the rotisserie in the cold room.\nAfter 3 min wash, spin briefly and transfer the chromatin/bead suspension to a new chilled screw cap tube. Ensure all beads have been transferred. Separate the beads using the magnetic stand and remove the supernatant as previously.\nSpin tubes at 960 × g for 3 min at 4°C and remove any residual STE buffer.\nCritical: collect the input samples from the −80°C freezer and thaw them on ice during this step.\nAdd 220 μL of SDS ChIP elution buffer to the beads. Also, bring input reactions to 220 μL in each tube by adding SDS ChIP elution buffer.\nNote: use wide bore P1000 tips as the SDS ChIP elution buffer is viscous.\nTo reverse crosslinking incubate the bead/input - elution buffer mixture at 70°C, 1,300 rpm in the thermomixer for 12–16 h.",
    "Note: make sure that the tube caps are tightly screwed and the thermomixer lid is well secured. Locking cap tubes can be used if screw caps are unavailable.\nCellular RNA and Protein Digestion (Day 4)\nTiming: 3 h 10 min\nPrior to library preparation, cellular carried over RNA and proteins released from the bound DNA are digested/proteolyzed to remove contaminating RNA and excess proteins that could interfere with subsequent steps.\nTake the tubes out of the thermomixer and allow to cool to 20°C–25°C.\nAdd 200 μL of 1× TE to each tube of biotin ChIP and input DNA (this will dilute SDS in the elution buffer and enable subsequent RNase and Proteinase K treatments).\nAdd 8 μL of 10 mg/mL RNase A (0.2 mg/mL final concentration).\nMix by flicking, spin down and incubate at 37°C for 1 h.\nAdd 4 μL of 20 mg/mL Proteinase K (0.2 mg/mL final concentration).\nMix by flicking, spin down and incubate at 55°C for 1 h.\nAdd another 4 μL of Proteinase K (0.4 mg/mL final concentration) after 1 h and incubate for another 1 h.\nNote For Chicken: adding 8 μL of Proteinase K and incubating for 2 h works as well.\nPlace the tubes on the magnetic stand for 1–2 min to collect the beads and transfer 400 μL of supernatant to a new screw cap tube.\nAdd 200 μL of 1× TE to each old tube with the beads, vortex vigorously for 10 s and spin beads down at 16,000 × g for 1 min at 20°C–25°C.\nRemove another 200 μL of supernatant and combine with the first eluate (this will wash any remaining chromatin off the streptavidin beads).\nAdd 200 μL of 1× TE to the tubes containing input DNA to maintain the same volume as for the ChIP-ed samples.",
    "Phenol-Chloroform DNA Precipitation (Day 4)\nTiming: 1 h 30 min\nInput DNA and released ChIP-ed DNA containing genome-wide regions previously bound by biotinylated POI are purified prior to the library preparation.\nAdd 600 μL phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (toxic if swallowed, inhaled or in contact with skin) to all tubes under the chemical hood, vortex extensively (~30–60 s) and spin tubes at maximum speed for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nNote: Letting samples rest for 30 s after vortexing can help with an initial separation of the layers before centrifugation.\nTransfer 250–280 μL of each aqueous layer into two new centrifuge tubes under the chemical hood.\nNote: samples are further split into half: 250–280 μL into two tubes. See Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/121-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Phenol-Chloroform Purification Step Dividing the Phase-Separated Aqueous Layer into Two for Further Purification Steps\nAdd 32 μL of 3 M Sodium Acetate (11% final volume) and 1.5 μL of 20 μg/μL glycogen (30 μg total glycogen) into all tubes (at this point you should have 8 tubes in total: 4 tubes for the ChIP-ed samples and 4 tubes for the input samples) under the chemical hood.\nAdd 970 μL of 4°C 100% EtOH into all tubes under the chemical hood. Incubate for at least 30 min at −80°C.\nPause Point: samples can be kept at −80°C for up to 24 h.\nSpin tubes at maximum speed for 30 min at 4°C to pellet DNA.\nPrepare 70% EtOH at 4°C.\nCarefully remove supernatant under the chemical hood, wash pellets with freshly prepared 1 mL of 4°C 70% EtOH and spin at maximum speed for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove 70% EtOH and spin tubes at maximum speed for 1 min at 4°C.",
    "Remove the remaining EtOH and dry the pellets by leaving the tubes open on the bench for 1–3 min.\nNote: do not over-dry the pellets as this will result in a major loss of DNA.\nResuspend each ChIP and input sample pellets in a final volume of 11.5 μL nuclease-free water.\nNote: At this point, recombine all ChIP and input samples into single ChIP and input tubes (at this point you should have 2 tubes in total) i.e. resuspend first ChIP or input pellet with 11.5 μL nuclease-free water, pipette 10 times up and down and transfer liquid into next tube and resuspend second pellet and so on until recombined ChIP or input samples are in the last tube (see Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). Do not mix input and ChIP samples.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/121-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Combing Material from Multiple Tubes into a Single Tube\nPulling four ChIP or input sample pellets into a single tube containing 11.5 μL nuclease-free water. Add fresh 11.5 μL nuclease-free water into a first pellet and resuspend thoroughly. Then transfer this resuspension into the next tube, resuspend the pellet and repeat two more times. The final tube contains combined material.\nLibrary Preparation and Purification (Day 4)\nTiming: 3.5–4 h\nPrecipitated 300–800 bp ChIP-ed and input DNA are first quantified prior to the library preparation. This is followed by ChIP and Input DNA template preparation, adapter ligation, sample indexing and amplification in order to be compatible with Illumina NGS platforms allowing pooled sample multiplexing. Finally, the prepared DNA libraries are purified away from the enzymatic reactions.\nQuantify precipitated ChIP and Input DNA fragments.\nNote: We use Qubit® dsDNA HS Assay Kit for precipitated DNA quantification using their standard protocol (see Qubit® dsDNA HS Assay Kit for precipitated DNA quantification user manual for more information: http://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/Qubit_dsDNA_HS_Assay_UG.pdf[href=http://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/Qubit_dsDNA_HS_Assay_UG.pdf]).",
    "Note: Add 1 μL of ChIP/input DNA (since input DNA is highly concentrated, for input measurements use 1:100 or 1:200 dilutions) into prepared sample tubes containing 199 μL Qubit mastermix.\nLibrary preparation.\nNote: We use Diagenode MicroPlex Library Preparation Kit v2 for the library preparation using the manufacturer’s standard protocol (see https://www.diagenode.com/files/products/kits/MicroPlex-Libary-Prep-Kit-v2-manual.pdf[href=https://www.diagenode.com/files/products/kits/MicroPlex-Libary-Prep-Kit-v2-manual.pdf] for more information). Of note, we used this Diagenode kit for library preparation, because it worked best in our hands. Newer kits could be utilized at user’s discretion.\nWe start the library preparation step by transferring remaining 10 μL of ChIP and 10 μL of same concentration input DNA into two PCR tubes (one each).\nNote: If ChIP sample could be quantified using Qubit sensitivity threshold, dilute the input sample to the same concentration as the quantified ChIP sample (if not, use 1 ng of input DNA for library preparation).\nNote: If ChIP samples could not be quantified using Qubit, select 12 cycles of amplification for the stage 5 library amplification step, extra 2–4 cycles can be added later if 12 amplification cycles are not enough (see below).\nAfter library amplification is finished, we recommend verifying unpurified libraries on the TapeStation station using High Sensitivity TapeStation D1000 reagents and ScreenTape. If amplified library quantity is still too low, unpurified libraries can be further amplified with no extra reagents added. To perform this additional amplification, spin down a PCR tube containing the library, transfer it to a thermal cycler and perform 2–4 PCR cycles as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_121_34.csv\nPause Point: Amplified samples can be stored at 4°C for 24 h or at −20°C for up to seven days.\nLibrary Purification using AMPure® XP beads:\nVortex beads thoroughly to resuspend.\nAdd 48 μL of beads (in a 1:1 bead to sample ratio) to library prep, pipette up and down 10 times.",
    "Incubate for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nPulse spin and place in magnetic stand, leave for 5 min for solution to clear.\nPrepare 80% EtOH at 20°C–25°C.\nRemove and discard supernatant, be careful not to remove any beads which now contain your DNA.\nAdd 300 μL freshly prepared 80% EtOH while in magnetic stand, leave for 30 s and remove, repeat this wash step once more.\nAir dry beads in magnetic stand with lids open for 3–5 min (right till beads appear matte).\nNote: do not over-dry the beads as this will result in a significant loss of eluted DNA!\nElute DNA with 20 μL of nuclease-free water.\nPulse spin, place in magnetic stand for 5 min.\nCarefully remove ~18 μL of supernatant and transfer to a new tube, this is your library DNA.\nVerify purified libraries on the TapeStation station using High Sensitivity TapeStation D1000 reagents and ScreenTape.\nPause Point: if not used immediately, purified libraries should be stored at −20°C."
