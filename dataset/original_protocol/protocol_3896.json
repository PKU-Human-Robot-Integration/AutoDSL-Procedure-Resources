    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe first major step is to create a stable cell line for the inducible expression of a protein scaffold that forms a biomolecular condensate, tagged with TurboID and Cry2.\nCloning procedure\nTiming: 2 weeks\nIntroduce your gene of interest (GOI), which encodes a major phase separation component of a condensate, into the pCDNA5_FRT-TO_TurboID-mCherry-Cry2 (Opto-module). We have deposited this plasmid with Addgene (ID number 166504). Sub-clone the cDNA encoding your protein of interest into pCDNA5_FRT-TO_TurboID-mCherry-Cry2 using standard molecular biology procedures. You can use a variety of cloning strategies. For example, the cDNA can be sub-cloned in the KpnI site of the vector (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) using the In-Fusion HD cloning system (Takara Bio, USA). For a detailed protocol and instructions on the design of primers, follow the manufacturer’s guidelines (https://www.takarabio.com/documents/User%20Manual/In/In-Fusion%20HD%20Cloning%20Kit%20User%20Manual_102518.pdf[href=https://www.takarabio.com/documents/User%20Manual/In/In-Fusion%20HD%20Cloning%20Kit%20User%20Manual_102518.pdf]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/837-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic representation of the pCDNA5_FRT-TO_TurboID-GOI-mCherry-Cry2 backbone vector and the cloning site of the gene of interest (GOI)\nThe GOI is under the control of a tetracycline-regulated CMV/TetO2 promoter and stably integrated into the Flp-In™T-REx™293 cell line after co-transfection with the POG44 recombinase. Stable transfectants are resistant to hygromycin B and blasticidin.\nVerify by DNA sequencing that the cDNA has been inserted in frame and that no mutations have been introduced in the construct.\nDesign multiple primers set to cover the entire gene of interest.\nUse the primers indicated in the Key Resources for the sequencing of the TurboID, mCherry and CRY2 genes.\nThis construct will allow you to generate stable Flp-In™T-REx™293 cell lines to express your protein of interest fused to TurboID and mcherry-CRY2, in an inducible manner. Before the production of stable cell lines, we recommend that you transfect the construct transiently to verify the expression and the localization of your protein of interest, as described below.\nExperimental validation of your construct",
    "Thaw the Flp-In™T-REx™293 cell line several days before the transfection day and maintain the cell line in medium containing Zeocin selective reagent (100 μg/mL) and blasticidin (15 μg/mL). Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for culturing and handling the Flp-In™T-REx™293 cell line: (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/flpintrexcells_man.pdf[href=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/flpintrexcells_man.pdf]).\nTransfect Flp-In™T-REx™293 using Lipofectamine™ 2000 Reagent as described in the manufacturer’s instructions (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/Lipofectamine_2000_Reag_protocol.pdf[href=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/Lipofectamine_2000_Reag_protocol.pdf])\nVerify by Western blotting that your protein of interest is expressed using either an anti-mCherry antibody or an antibody directed against your protein of interest.\nUsing standard fluorescence microscopy, verify the intracellular localization of your protein of interest.\nGeneration of stable cell lines expressing your protein of interest\nTiming: 6–8 weeks\nGenerate stable Flp-In™T-REx™293 expression cell lines by co-transfection of the pCDNA5_FRT-TO_TurboID-GOI-mCherry-Cry2 expression construct and the pOG44 recombinase plasmid (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nNote: We used Flp-In™T-REx™293 cell lines but it is also possible to use Flp-In™T-REx™ U2OS/HeLa cell lines. We noticed however that the expression level of recombinant proteins was heterogeneous in U20S/HeLa Flp-In™T-REx™ cells.\nNote: Flp-In™T-REx™293 are generally amenable to transfection using standard methods. However, we recommend the transfection by Lipofectamine™ 2000 Reagent. Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for the transfection procedure (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/Lipofectamine_2000_Reag_protocol.pdf[href=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/Lipofectamine_2000_Reag_protocol.pdf]).\nSelect stable transfectants using 100–200 μg/mL hygromycin B.\nAfter 6–8 weeks of selection, pool all the hygromycin resistant foci.\nGrow the cells until 70–80% confluence, harvest and freeze multiple vials of early-passage cells.\nPause point: Place the cell vials in liquid nitrogen for long-term cryopreservation.\nExperimental validation of the stable cell lines\nTiming: 1 week\nInduce the expression of your gene of interest with doxycycline to a final concentration of 2 μg/mL.\nNote: Optimize the concentration of doxycycline for your specific application.\nNote: For immunofluorescence analysis, culture cells on coverslips.\nIncubate the cells for 16 h to 24 h at 37°C.",
    "The next day, place the plates in the illumination box in a CO2 incubator for optogenetic activation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].2).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/837-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. A custom-built blue LED illumination device used for this method\nThe illumination box is placed inside a cell culture incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nApply multiple light-dark cycles. For induction of TopBP1 condensation, we use cycles of 4 s light followed by 10 s dark for 3 min (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].3).\nNote: Induction of biomolecular condensates usually occurs within minutes. The efficacy of optogenetic induction of condensates depends on protein concentration and protein sequence, hence the time of exposure to blue-light depends on your specific application.\nProcess the samples for whole cell extraction or fixation and immunostaining using standard procedures.\nEvaluate the expression level of the doxycycline-inducible protein by immunoblot analysis (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/837-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Validation of the TurboID-TopBP1-mCherry-Cry2 protein expression and condensation system\n(A) Whole-cell extracts from Flp-In™T-REx™293 cell line expressing stably TurboID-TopBP1-mCherry-Cry2 were incubated or not with 2 μg/mL doxycycline for 24 h, as indicated, and the indicated proteins were revealed by immunoblotting. Tubulin is a loading control.\n(B) Representative fluorescence images of cells expressing TurboID-TopBP1-mCherry-Cry2, before (Light OFF) and after (Light ON) optogenetic activation with cycles of 4 s light (488nm)-10 s resting for 3 min.

Step-by-step representation of the experimental plan to isolate biotinylated proteins by affinity\nCreated with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com].\nVerify by standard fluorescence microscopy the ability of your recombinant protein to form biomolecular condensates upon light activation (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nBiotin - labeling of proteins within light-induced condensates\nTiming: 2 days",
    "In this second major step, you will control the formation of biomolecular condensates with 488 nm light and label component proteins with biotin (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nThe required number of cells depends on your specific application (e.g., immunoblotting, mass spectrometry). This protocol describes the analysis of TopBP1 proximal proteins by immunoblotting using 4 × 106 Flp-InTMT-RExTM293 cells stably transfected with the doxycycline-inducible TurboID-TopBP1WT-mCherry-Cry2 construct.\nDay 1 Morning:\nPrewarm cell media, PBS, and trypsin at 37°C in a water bath.\nSeed 4 × 106 Flp-InTMT-RExTM293 cells/per 10 cm dish in 5 mL of DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) without any selection antibiotics. Use three dishes for a typical experiment:\nwith doxycycline/ Light OFF\nwithout doxycycline/ Light ON\nwith doxycycline/ Light ON\nDay 1 Evening:\nAdd 4 μg/mL of doxycycline in a falcon tube containing 5 mL of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS to reach a final concentration of 2 μg/mL doxycycline, as described in step 18.\nAdd the 5 mL DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 4 μg/mL doxycycline to the 5 mL cells culture from step 16. The final concentration of doxycycline is 2 μg/mL. Allow protein expression for 16–24 h.\nDay 2:\nPrewarm the DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS at 37°C.\nThaw the biotin stock solution.\nPrepare in 15 mL Falcon tube 10 mL of DMEM supplemented with 500 μM biotin and keep at 37°C.\nPlace the illumination box in a humidified 37°C incubator with 5% CO2 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nReplace the cell culture medium with 10 mL of DMEM media supplemented with 500 μM biotin and 2 μg/mL doxycycline.\nCritical: Add the medium from the wall of the cell culture dish and not directly on the cells to avoid cell detachment.",
    "Transfer rapidly the cell culture dish without cover into the custom-made illumination box and turn ON the device.\nNote: At this stage, it is not essential to manipulate cells in a sterile environment because the cells will be collected and lysed for biochemical analyses immediately after optogenetic induction of condensates.\nExpose the cells to blue light for 10 min of light-dark cycles (4 s light followed by 30 s dark).\nNote: In principle, high doses of 488 nm light could generate reactive oxygen species. However, in comparison with dental photo-polymerization sources, for example, the light intensity used here (10 mW/cm2) is weak. Yet, it would be wise to minimize exposure times. For example, 3 minutes of light dark cycles (4 s light followed by 10 s resting in the dark) induce robust TopBP1 condensation. After optogenetic activation, condensates will dissolve progressively. Five minutes after light activation, approximatively 40% of TopBP1 condensates have dissolved (Frattini et al. 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). The light-dark cycle parameters required for the maintenance of condensates during proximity labeling depends on the cellular concentration and on the sequence of the protein that holds condensates together via multiple weak and cooperative interactions. The parameters of optogenetic activation need to be determined on a case-by-case basis.\nTurn OFF the device.\nRemove medium completely by aspiration and wash the cells carefully at 18°C–25°C with 5 mL/ of 1× PBS per dish.\nGently scrape all the cells off the plate with a cell scraper and place the cell suspension in a 15 mL Falcon tube. Keep on ice.\nCentrifuge the cells at 400 × g for 3 min.\nAspirate the medium and freeze the pellet at −80°C.\nProceed to the next step.\nPause point: You can store the cell pellets at −80°C for several weeks before proceeding to the next step.",
    "Affinity purification of biotinylated proteins\nTiming: 2 days\nThe third major step is to isolate biotinylated proteins using streptavidin coated beads and identify these proteins by immunoblotting or proteomic analyses (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nPrepare all the buffers listed in the Materials section (You can prepare them several days before the experiment).\nNote: To reduce keratin contamination, use DNase/RNase-free tubes that have not previously been opened and wear gloves.\nThe day of the experiment, add 1X of complete protease and phosphatase inhibitors to 10 mL of RIPA/SDS Lysis buffer.\nThaw gently the frozen cell pellets.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 500 μL of RIPA/SDS Lysis buffer supplemented with 1X complete protease and phosphatase inhibitors and 250 U benzonase and transfer the lysate into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nIncubate the pellet on a rotating wheel for 1 h at 4°C.\nSonicate the lysate on ice using a sonicator (40% amplitude, 3 cycles 10 s sonication- 2 s resting).\nCritical: Clean the sonicator probe between samples to avoid cross-contamination.\nSpin down cellular debris at 16000 × g for 30 min at 4°C.\nNote: During the centrifugation step, prepare the required amount of agarose-streptavidin (50 μl of agarose streptavidin beads slurry per condition). Resuspend gently the stock of streptavidin beads by tapping/flicking the bottom of the tube. Wash the beads twice with RIPA/SDS lysis buffer and resuspend in RIPA/SDS buffer.\nTransfer the cleared supernatant to a new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nDetermine total protein concentration using Bradford protein assay.\nTo isolate biotinylated proteins from cell lysates, incubate up to 1 mg of cell lysates with the pre-washed agarose-streptavidin beads for 3 h on a rotating wheel at 4°C.\nSpin the bead suspensions for 1 min at 400 × g, at 18°C–25°C , and carefully remove the supernatant by pipetting.",
    "Wash the beads via resuspension and incubation on a rotating wheel for 3 min as indicated below. Between each step, pull down the beads by centrifugation for 1 min at 400 × g at 18°C–25°C and remove carefully the supernatant:\nWash with 1 mL of RIPA/SDS Lysis buffer\nWash with 1 mL Wash buffer 1\nWash with 1 mL Wash buffer 2\nWash with 1 mL Wash buffer 3\nWash with 1 mL Wash buffer 4 (twice)\nCritical: Avoid pipetting the beads excessively, as they can bind to the pipet tips, leading to sample loss.\nAdd 60 μL of 2X Laemmli Sample buffer to each sample and flick to mix.\nHeat samples for 10 min at 95°C to elute the proteins.\nPause point: The samples can be stored at −20°C or −80°C for at least 1 year.\nCritical: Avoid multiple boiling and freezing cycles of your samples.\nFor western blot analysis, resolve proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). We recommend loading 2–4 μg of proteins in the “Input” control well.\nFor Mass spectrometry analyses, use up to 2 mg of proteins isolated by streptavidin pull down. Analyze raw mass spectrometry data using the MaxQuant software (version 1.5.5.1) with standard settings. Use Perseus (version 1.6.1.1) for graphical representation and statistical analysis. Perform a standard t test to evaluate differences of protein abundance between samples."
