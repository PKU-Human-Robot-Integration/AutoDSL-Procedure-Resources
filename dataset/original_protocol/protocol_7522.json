    "Sample preparation Preparation of plasmidsClone the cDNA of the proteins of interest (POI) and the standards into the vector plasmid pcDNA3 or pcDNA5/FRT/TO. The proteins must be labeled with two fluorophores—in our case, mVenus and PAmCherry. We chose to fuse the coding sequence of mVenus and PAmCherry to the C-terminus of the coding region of the POI or the protein standard to simplify the procedure and because we had prior knowledge that the function of the proteins would remain largely intact. C-terminal linkage of the fluorophores, however, is not a requirement of our method. Fluorophores may be linked to the N-terminus or embedded within the protein itself. It may be necessary to perform functional experiments to assess whether the function is impaired by linkage to fluorescent proteins such as mVenus and PAmCherry. If possible, it may be possible to link one fluorophore to the N-terminus and the other fluorophore to the C-terminus of the protein. This would eliminate the need to consider unwanted truncation of the fluorophores and thus the need for the parameter m (Equation 2).We used barttin as the monomeric, the ClC-K and ClC-2 as the dimeric, EAAT2 as the trimeric, and Kcnj2 as the tetrameric standards. However, other plasma membrane proteins can also be tested and used as the standard. Some important criteria for choosing the standard proteins include: (1) the protein should be predominantly in the plasma membrane; (2) the protein should be expressed well in the chosen model cell line; and (3) the protein should have a mostly homogeneous oligomeric state, but not aggregate with others into super complexes or dissociate into individual subunits. We used a linker between the POI or standard protein and the fluorescent protein tag consisting of a flexible hydrophilic sequence with 10–30 amino acid residues.",
    "The linker should not be too long since it may increase the chance of protein cleavage. For more details about the standard proteins and the linker sequences, please refer to Tan et al. (2022).Preparation of coverslipsPlace the coverslips (25 mm) in the Coplin slide staining jar, standing vertically and separate from each other, so that both sides can be immersed in Piranha solution (see below).Determine the volume of Piranha solution that is needed to completely immerse the coverslips in the Coplin jar. With the Coplin jar and coverslips that we specify in Materials and Reagents, 32 mL is sufficient.Note: Piranha solution is hazardous and can be life-threatening if not handled properly! It is advised to consult the safety department of your institution and get training and permission before use. All procedures involving Piranha solution must be performed under a fume hood, and the experimental personnel should wear protective equipment, including lab coat, acid resistant gloves, and goggles. It is very important to keep the area free of any organic solutions, such as acetic acid and ethanol, since mixing Piranha solution with organic solutions is strongly exothermic and may lead to an explosion. Put a cleaned and dry glass beaker with an acid-resistant stirring bar on a magnetic stirring plate. Do not use heat since preparation of Piranha solution is already strongly exothermic. Starting from this step, the operation must be performed under a chemical fume hood.With a clean glass pipette, add three volumes (3/4 of the total needed volume of Piranha solution) of concentrated sulfuric acid into the beaker. For 32 mL of Piranha solution, three volumes equal 24 mL.Turn on stirring at a low speed, so liquid does not spill out of the beaker.",
    "With a glass pipette, slowly add one volume (1/4 of the total needed volume of Piranha solution) of 30% hydrogen peroxide solution to the sulfuric acid in the beaker while slowly stirring it. For 32 mL of Piranha solution, one volume equals 8 mL.Note: Heat very quickly builds up and the beaker becomes hot, so use caution when handling it. Keep the solution stirring for approximately 3 min to fully mix up and stabilize.Pour the Piranha solution into the Coplin jar with coverslips. Before pouring, attach a magnet under the beaker to hold the stirring bar, so it will not fall out.Cover the Coplin jar with the lid but do not seal it since gas will be generated in the cleaning process.Note: Sealing the lid can lead to an explosion. Leave the filled jar under the laminar hood for five days.To handle the residual Piranha solution left in the beaker, use a glass pipette under the laminar hood to slowly add 50 mL of water into the beaker while stirring it on the magnetic plate. While adding water, attach the tip of the glass pipette to the inner wall of the beaker to avoid any splash of liquid out of the beaker.Slowly add 5 M sodium hydroxide solution to neutralize the diluted residue Piranha solution while keeping it stirred. Use a pH indicator paper to confirm neutrality.Pour the neutralized solution into the sink.When the cleaning is done after five days, prepare a large beaker full of crushed ice with a stirring bar on the bottom. The size of this beaker should be at least 30 times the volume of the Piranha solution.Put the beaker on the magnetic plate under the laminar hood. Do not use heat.",
    "Carefully pour the Piranha solution onto the ice in the beaker while retaining the coverslips in the Coplin jar.Start stirring slowly.When the ice is melted, carefully add NaOH pellets to the solution to neutralize it while stirring.Discard the solution according to institutional guidelines when it is pH neural, stabilized, and cooled down.Rinse the coverslips in the Coplin jar with double-distilled water 20 times. Collect the waste from the first three rinses into a beaker and neutralize with NaOH solution before discarding.For storage, immerse the cleaned coverslips in double-distilled water in the same jar with the lid sealed with parafilm. Keep refrigerated.Cell culture and passage of HEK293T cellsCulture HEK293T cells in culture medium (DMEM supplemented with 50 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin and 10% FBS) in 10 cm Petri dishes at 37 °C in the cell culture incubator supplemented with 5% CO2 (Tan et al., 2017). Passage them at least once a week. Refresh the medium every three days. To passage the cells, follow the procedures below:Culture the stock cells with 10 mL of medium in 10 cm Petri dishes. Aspirate the medium from the dish.Wash the cells with 10 mL of PBS three times. Aspirate the solution.Add 1 mL of trypsin solution warmed up to 37 °C in advance to the dish. Evenly spread the solution on the bottom of the dish.Incubate the dish on a 37 °C heating plate for 1 min.Shake the dish on the desk to fully detach the cells from the dish bottom. Check under the cell culture microscope if cells are detached.Add 9 mL of culture medium (pre-warmed to 37 °C) to the dish. Split the cells by resuspending the cell suspension 10 times to get single cells. Examine the cell suspension under the microscope and check if cells are separated.",
    "Add 1 mL of cell suspension into a new 10 cm dish with 10 mL of fresh medium pre-warmed to 37 °C. Gently shake the dish to evenly distribute the cells.Place the dish into a cell culture incubator. Passage the cells ten times until replacing with newly thawed cells.Cell transfectionTo prepare cells for transfection, use cleaned and sterilized tweezers to transfer a cleaned 25 mm coverslip into a 3.5 cm Petri dish. The coverslips have become hydrophilic during treatment with Piranha solution, so no further surface coating is required for HEK293T cells.Add 2 mL of warm culture medium to the dish.Dispense 0.1 mL of cell suspension onto the coverslip prepared as described above for cell passaging. Swirl the dish carefully to distribute the cells evenly. The volume of the cell suspension should be chosen such that the cells are sparsely distributed on the dish bottom and separate from one another after they settle down.Keep the cells in the incubator for 6 h to let them settle down.Prepare two autoclaved 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and add 100 μL of OptiMEM to each of them. Add 1 μg of plasmid of interest to one tube and 3 μL of Lipofectamine 2000 to the other one.Incubate both tubes separately at room temperature for 5 min.Slowly transfer the DNA-OptiMEM mixture to the Lipofectamine 2000–containing tube drop by drop.Incubate the mixture at room temperature for 20 min.Drop by drop, add the mixture to the 3.5 cm Petri dish of cells prepared 6 h before.Incubate the cells in the incubator overnight.Cell fixationAfter the overnight incubation with the transfection mixture, aspirate the culture medium.Wash the cells gently with 2 mL of PBS five times. To avoid introducing impurities, the PBS solution should be filtered with a 0.",
    "22 μm sterile filter during preparation, stored in a cleaned and autoclaved glass bottle, and refrigerated.Add 2 mL of -20 °C methanol to the dish and incubate at -20 °C for 5 min.Remove the methanol and wash five times with 2 mL of PBS.Keep the cells in PBS.Imaging of the standard proteins and the proteins of interest Note: The following steps are specific to each individual microscope/control software combination. We give example values and settings for the microscope used in Tang et al. (2015) and Tan et al. (2022). The proper values for your setup (in particular for the camera and laser) will have to be locally determined and adjusted. Please discuss with your appropriate local experts and technicians, if necessary. After fixation, take the coverslip with cells from the Petri dish and mount in a recording chamber. Our chamber was custom-made, holding up to 2 mL of solution and being placed on the stage of the microscope, stabilized with magnets.To track the sample drift and for chromatic aberration corrections, dilute 1 μL of TetraSpeck fluorescent bead solution (vortexed) with 0.5 mL of PBS and then transfer it to the imaging chamber containing the coverslip with the fixed cells.Leave the sample in a light-proof box for 1 h in the imaging room. This allows the beads to settle and attach to the coverslip (Figure 1A and 1B) and the temperature to reach the lab temperature (22 °C), minimizing sample drift due to thermal shift.Note: The lab temperature should be monitored and maintained by air conditioning at a constant temperature (in our case, 22 °C) to avoid thermal drift and to guarantee the optimal performance of the setup. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4749/bioprotoc-13-13-4749-g001.jpgFigure 1. Representative image for the appropriate density of fiducial markers and PAmCherry blinking events.",
    "(A) A total of 12 beads (marked by green arrow heads) are attached to the coverslip around the cell after the pre-imaging incubation, shown as bright spots. Cells with beads on top are usually not used for imaging because the bright emissions from the beads interfere with the fluorescent proteins. Scale bar, 5 μm. (B) Gold indicates the area covered by the cell, while the red arrow heads indicate the blinking events recorded within the cell area on the PAmCherry channel during a single frame. Very bright spots around the cell are emissions from the fluorescent beads seen in A. Scale bars, 5 μm.For the same purpose, add 2 mL of PBS for use as imaging buffer to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and let it warm up to the lab temperature.During the bead incubation period, switch on the imaging system to warm it up for at least half an hour.Align the lasers and adjust the laser intensities at the sample plane according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Laser intensities must be chosen so that individual blinking events are spatially separated to allow for the extraction of super-resolution information. On the other hand, recording durations should allow for the activation and bleaching of all fluorescent proteins present in the sample. As a guide, for our experiments, we measured an intensity of 4.4 mW for the 514 nm laser and 5.4 mW for the 561 nm laser in the sample plane. We increased the intensity of the 405 nm laser during PAmCherry imaging slowly from 3.0 µW to 4.8 mW, so that each frame contained several spatially separated blinking events.Aspirate the bead solution from the coverslip and rinse it gently with 1 mL of PBS pre-warmed to the lab temperature.",
    "Remove the solution and gently add 1 mL of PBS pre-warmed to the lab temperature.Put the imaging chamber onto the microscope stage. Let it stabilize for 15 min. To lower the background signal level and therefore increase the signal-to-noise ratio, either darken the lab or, even better, cover the stage area.Set up the parameters for the camera to have 50 ms exposure and 85.59 ms as the duration between frames, including read-out of data from the camera. The frame duration affects the number of frames that a blinking event covers. Therefore, one must tweak the minimal number of localizations parameter for the clustering analysis if different values are chosen.In widefield mode, use the green imaging channel (for mVenus) to choose a cell with moderate-to-low expression level of the transfected plasmid.Move the cell to the center of the view. Around the cell there should be 3–6 beads seen as bright spots in both color channels. Trajectories of the individual beads during the acquisition will be used for the sample drift correction.In widefield mode, turn on the 561 nm laser for approximately 3,000 frames to bleach impurities within the sample. Background signals will be significantly reduced while PAmCherry molecules are largely unaffected without activation by the 405 nm laser.Adjust the axial position of the sample stage to bring the beads into focus, as determined by reaching the maximal fluorescence from the beads.With the white light and the 561 nm laser on, take a transmission image to record the location and shape of the cell and beads.Switch to TIRF mode and record 4,000 frames with the 514 nm laser for mVenus. Usually, all mVenus molecules should be bleached at the end of recording. In case there are still many blinking events at the end, recording can be continued for another 2,000 frames.",
    "If this extended period still does not exhaust blinking events, it indicates either that the expression level is too high, or the laser power is too low. With the emission filter settings and the cleaning procedure, there should be very few blinking events on the green channel from the impurities outside of the cell. This is critical for the DCC algorithm to work.With the same TIRF settings, record 6,000–12,000 frames with the 561 nm laser for PAmCherry, with 405 nm activation laser intensity increasing from the minimal to the maximal laser power (Section B.4), allowing the emission events to be sparsely distributed (as shown in Figure 1B) and all PAmCherry molecules to be bleached at the end of the recording. If 12,000 frames cannot exhaust all the blinking events within the cell, it may indicate that the expression level is too high.Adjust the axial position of the sample stage and bring it to focus judging from the intensity of the beads. If the offset is larger than 100 nm, then the recording is considered invalid due to large z-axis drift and must be discarded.To record beads for the lateral chromatic aberration (LCA) correction using the fitted LCA protocol with the same sample, choose a region on the coverslip that does not contain any transfected cells but only beads (> 10, the more the better as long as they do not overlap with one another). In widefield mode, record 50 frames for each of the green and red channels as a single recording. Slightly move the sample to change the position of the beads and record another 50 frames. Repeat this moving and recording procedure numerous times to extract information from beads in at least 100 different positions, evenly distributed across the whole field of view.",
    "Preparation of a bead sample To record beads for the lateral chromatic aberration correction using the regional LCA protocol, prepare a bead-only sample for the SMLM recording. This sample can be stored in the dark at room temperature and lasts for several experiments.Clean a microscope slide (75 mm × 25 mm) as for the coverslips with Piranha solution and let it air dry before use.Thoroughly vortex the multi-color TetraSpeck fluorescent bead solution for 1 min.Add 5 μL of bead solution into 400 μL of double-distilled water in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and then vortex to mix it.Add the diluted bead solution to a cleaned coverslip (25 mm) and let it air dry at room temperature.After drying, place the coverslip on a microscope slide with the side of beads facing down towards the slide.Dip a micropipette tip in nail polish and place 4–5 tiny drops on the edge of the coverslip to glue the coverslip onto the slide.Once the nail polish is dry, the bead sample is ready for use.Store the sample in the dark at room temperature until next imaging.Imaging of the bead sample Note: The following steps are specific to each individual microscope/control software combination. The exact values (in particular for the camera and laser) will have to be locally determined and adjusted for your setup. Please discuss with your appropriate local experts and technicians. Launch the microscope and align the lasers as for the cell sample.Mount the bead sample slide on a custom-made chamber that can stick to the microscope stage with magnets. The coverslip should be facing towards the objective when the slide is on the microscope stage.Place the sample on the microscope stage and let it stabilize for approximately 20 min.",
    "Set up the acquisition parameters so that pixel size, exposure time, and frame rates are the same as those for cell sample imaging. The excitation laser intensities can be reduced to avoid over-exposure since beads are much brighter than fluorescent proteins.In widefield mode, record the bead sample for 50 frames each in the green and red channels as a single recording.Slightly move the sample and repeat the imaging if the density of the beads is too low. Usually, a total of 500 beads or 500 positions from fewer beads in the field of view can be sufficient, as shown in Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4749/bioprotoc-13-13-4749-g002.jpgFigure 2. Example of bead recordings used for the lateral chromatic aberration correction. Left: A total of 18 individual bead recordings are combined to occupy the whole camera view (~41 × 41 μm). Each white spot indicates a bead recorded on the PAmCherry channel, spanning 50 frames. Scale bar, 5 μm. Right: Enlarged area defined by the red square in the left image. Scale bars, 1 μm.Extraction of localizations Using SNSMIL software:We used SNSMIL (Tang et al., 2015) to localize the emission events in the recorded videos (image frames). This software was developed using recordings taken with our microscope setup and is therefore particularly optimized for our use case.Alternatively, we have used the newer software SMAP (Ries, 2020) to extract localizations from the fluorescence signals in the recorded videos. This software uses improved algorithms and may work better with other microscopes. In our hands, we did not find a general advantage of using either SMAP or SNSMIL."
