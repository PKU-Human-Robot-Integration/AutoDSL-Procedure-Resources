    "1. Protospacer definition and plasmid construction\nNOTE: In this section, the first step of selecting appropriate protospacers for constructing the sgRNA and further ligation into pMaOri.dCas9, is described (Figure 1). This protospacer sequence comprises of a 20 nucleotides sequence against the desired target.\nObtain the nucleotide sequence of the gene of interest for silencing at GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank). Submit it to the CHOPCHOP webserver (http://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/), with parameters defined for Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 and protospacer adjacent motif NGG after selecting the \"Fasta Target\". Define the parameters to \"CRISPR/Cas9\" and PAM (protospacer adjacent motif) NGG.\nBased on the results obtained, select protospacers with the best score possible (green arrow), that are located as close as possible to the 5´end of the coding region and, most importantly, are contained in the template (minus) strand since the sgRNA must pair to the coding strand of the gene for complete gene silencing.\n\tNOTE: The NGG motif is not included in the final sgRNA sequence.\nUse the lipL32 promoter to express the single guide RNA that contains a variable 20 nucleotide sequence at the 5' end and a conserved dCas9 scaffold sequence. Merge the 20-nt sequence, termed protospacer, to the lipL32 promoter (at its 5´ end) and sgRNA scaffold (3'end) (Figure 1B).\n\tNOTE: For a well-defined lipL32 promoter, utilize the promoter region comprising -334 to the TSS (Transcription Start Site, based on Zhukova et al.9). Check the Supplementary File for the final sgRNA cassette.\nGenerate the sgRNA cassette by sequential PCR5 or have it synthesized by a commercial provider.\nAfter obtaining the cassette, ligate it into pMaOri.dCas9 plasmid at the XmaI restriction site at both ends (cccggg)4.\n\t\nDigest both the sgRNA cassette and pMaOri.dCas9 plasmid with XmaI restriction enzyme and proceed to ligation (Figure 1B).",
    "Perform the cloning steps in the dT auxotrophic E. coli strain π110, due to the pMaOri11 (and by extension, pMaOri.dCas9) origin of replication, R6K-gamma.\n\t\t​NOTE: For a detailed protocol for ligation and clone selection, refer to previous publications by Fernandes and Nascimento12. sgRNA-guided dCas9 will bind to the coding strand of the selected gene of interest and, therefore, will obstruct RNA polymerase elongation (Figure 1C), resulting in gene silencing.\n2. Leptospira transformation by conjugation\nNOTE: A graphical scheme of this step is presented in Figure 2. To make HAN media and HAN plates, refer to Hornsby et al.13 and Fernandes et al.5.\nGrow pathogenic Leptospira cells at 29 or 37 °C in HAN media13 under agitation by diluting a saturated culture in fresh HAN at 1:100; typically, L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130 takes 4-6 days to reach the appropriate cell density.\n\t\nEnsure cultures reach an O.D. of 0.2-0.4 at 420 nm (2 to 5 x 108 cells/mL) before using for conjugation.\n\t\tNOTE: Since HAN media changes color as cell densities increase (due to phenol red contained in DMEM media), centrifuge (4,000 x g, 15 min, room temperature) 1 mL of the culture media to remove leptospires and apply supernatant as a blank for measuring the O.D.\nTransform the conjugative E. coli strain β2163, auxotrophic for Diaminopimelic acid (DAP), with the plasmid pMaOri.dCas9 containing the sgRNA cassette. For E. coli transformation, use either heat-shock protocols or electroporation. Include transformation with the plasmid pMaOri.dCas9 with no sgRNA cassette as a control.",
    "For heat-shock transformation, mix the plasmid DNA (100 ng) with chemically competent E. coli cells and incubate on ice for 30 min. Perform heat shock at 42 °C for 90 s and place it again on ice for 5 min. Recover the cells by adding 1 mL of LB media, incubate at 37 °C for 1 h and proceed to the plating.\nFor electroporation, use electrocompetent cells mixed with 100 ng of plasmid DNA. Use the following parameters for pulse: 1.8 kV, 100 Ω, and 25 µF. Recover the cells as explained above.\nPlate the transformed donor E. coli cells in LB agar medium supplemented with Diaminopimelic acid (DAP) (0.3 mM) and spectinomycin (40 μg/mL) to select for plasmids.\nFor conjugation, select one colony from each plate one day before the day of conjugation (which is determined by monitoring the O.D. of cultures of leptospires).\n\t\nSelect one colony of E. coli β2163 from the empty pMaOri.dCas9, and one from pMaOri.dCas9sgRNA plates. Allow them to grow overnight in 10 mL of LB plus DAP and spectinomycin at 37 °C.\nThe next day, dilute the saturated cultures 1:100 in 10 mL of fresh LB plus DAP (do not include the antibiotic here) until OD420nm of 0.2-0.4. Normally, it takes 2-3 h for E. coli to reach these densities.\nInside a BSL2 biosafety hood, assemble a filtration apparatus by placing a 25 mm diameter, 0.1 µm pore size, mixed cellulose esters membrane filter on the top of the glass base. Place a 15 mL glass funnel on the top and hold both pieces with spring clamps. Connect the glass to a vacuum pump and add the cultures to the funnel for filtration.",
    "Add 5 mL of Leptospira culture to the funnel. Add a volume of E. coli to constitute the 1:1 proportion based on the OD420nm values of both cultures. Turn on the vacuum pump and concentrate cells by filtration. After cell concentration in the membrane filter, carefully retrieve it. Ensure medium is filtered through the membrane.\n\tNOTE: Filtration takes 5 to 10 min.\nPlace the filter on a commercially available EMJH plate (see Table of Materials) supplemented with DAP (0.3 mM). Ensure that bacteria side is up. Incubate the plates at 29 °C for 24 h.\n\tNOTE: If HAN or supplemented in-house EMJH14 plates are used, E. coli can proliferate and overcome the intended 1:1 proportion, which in turn can decrease conjugation efficiency5.\nAfter 24 h, recover the filters from the plates and place each individual filter in a 50 mL conical tube.\nUse 1 mL of liquid HAN medium to release the cells from the filter surface by extensive pipetting and vortexing.\nVisualize the recovered mixed bacterial solutions by dark field microscopy to check for cell viability and motility, and Leptospira:E. coli proportions.\n\tNOTE: At this stage, equivalent numbers of E. coli and Leptospira can be seen.\nSpread 100-200 μL of this culture onto HAN plates containing 0.4% inactivated rabbit serum and 40 μg/mL spectinomycin. Incubate plates at 37 °C in a 3% CO2 atmosphere.\n\t​NOTE: Normally, L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130 cells form colonies in 5-7 days on control plates and in 8-10 days on spectinomycin plates. At this stage, E. coli will not grow since they are auxotrophic for DAP.\nAs a control, dilute cultures at 104 leptospires/mL and add 100 μL onto plates without antibiotic, for monitoring leptospiral growth.\n3. Colony selection and transconjugant growth and validation",
    "NOTE: Colonies should be apparent by day 10. However, they are not too easy to visualize. Normally at this time point, HAN plates are a bit opaque because of the dried cells that were spread and Leptospira colonies can appear as a transparent halo against the whitish background. It is recommended to view the plates at different angles to achieve different light incidence, therefore, making the colonies more apparent. At longer incubation times, colonies can acquire a denser appearance, and in this case, they present as milky halos against a dark background.\nAdd 100 μL of liquid HAN media to each 1.5 mL microtube to recover mutants. Take at least 3 colonies from each plate.\n\t\nWith the aid of a micropipette tip, \"dig\" the agar to retrieve the colonies from the plates since leptospiral colonies can be subsurface.\n\t\tNOTE: Agar is expected to be taken along at this stage. Colonies should be taken from control plates containing empty pMaOri.dCas9 plasmid, and plates with leptospires containing plasmids expressing both dCas9 and single guide RNA, designed for the target gene.\nDispense the collected colony in 100 μL of HAN media in a 1.5 mL microtube and vigorously homogenize. At this stage, ensure maximal break of the agar integrity to release cells. Vortex the suspension for 10 s.\nVisualize the recovered cells by dark field microscopy at a 200-400x magnification by adding a 5 µL drop onto a glass slide and cover the samples immediately with a coverslip.\n\t\nConfirm the presence of live and viable leptospires recovered from the colonies.\nAfter visualization and confirmation of viable leptospires, transfer 100 μL of cells to liquid HAN media containing 40 μg/mL spectinomycin.",
    "After growth in liquid HAN media, evaluate the cultures for the presence of the plasmid with primer pMaOri2 F (ACGCAATGTATCGATACCGAC) and R (ATAGGTGAAGTAGGCCCACCC), which recognize the region that flanks the sgRNA cassette.\n\t\nCollect 200 μL of culture, centrifuge (4,000 x g, 15 min), discard the supernatant, and resuspend the resulting pellet in 20 μL of water.\nUse this suspension as a template for additional PCR, without the need for DNA extraction12.\n\t\tNOTE: Cells with pMaOri.dCas9 will render an amplicon of 281 bp, compared to those containing the plasmids with the sgRNA cassette which will render an amplicon of 723 bp.\nFor confirmation of gene silencing, perform an immunoblot utilizing cell extracts from transconjugants containing only pMaOri.dCas9 (negative control) and pMaOri.dCas9sgRNA.\n\t\nApply the equivalent of 5 x 107 cells per lane of the sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel.\nElectrotransfer proteins to a membrane for incubation with appropriate antibodies. Besides the antibody against the target gene for silencing, use another one for loading control.\nKeep the mutant cultures in HAN media plus spectinomycin for maintaining the plasmid. If no antibiotics are applied to the media, complete gene silencing can be observed for at least three passages5."
