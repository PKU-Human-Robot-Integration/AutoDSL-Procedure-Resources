    "Cell fixation and sorting (human cells)Harvest the cells in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, and resuspend them in PBS.Fix the cells for 10 min at room temperature with 1% formaldehyde (in PBS).Quench the crosslink with 125 mM glycine and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.Stain the cells with Hoechst stain and use the flow cytometer to sort 100 cells into 200 μl of 140 mM RIPA buffer (Recipe 3).Note: Sorting small number of cells will have no effect on buffer composition owing to small volume.Cell isolation, fixation and sorting (Drosophila neuroblasts)Dissect the required number of larval brains in PBS (for example: transgenic flies expressing GFP-tagged deadpan (Dpn) protein under the control of its endogenous enhancer).Wash once with PBS and fix the brains with 1% formaldehyde (in PBT) for 10 min at room temperature.Quench the crosslink with 125 mM glycine and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.Remove the quenching solution and wash twice with PBS.Add the dissociation solution (Recipe 1) to the brain tissue and leave it for 1 h at 30 °C with constant shaking at 650 rpm. Stir the brains at every 15 min interval by pipetting them up and down.Pellet the cells by centrifuging them at 100 x g and resuspend in PBS.Sort cells on flow cytometer under GFP channel, and directly sort 1,000 cells into 200 μl of 140 mM RIPA buffer.Note: Sorting small number of cells will have no effect on buffer composition owing to small volume.ImmunoprecipitationBind 1 μg of antibody to 15 μl of protein G dynabeads in 200 μl blocking buffer (Recipe 2).Incubate at 4 °C for 2-3 h.Break the nuclei of the cells collected in RIPA for 3 cycles at low power setting in a Bioruptor sonicator, 30 sec “ON”/“OFF”.",
    "Remove the blocking buffer by putting the tubes on DynaMag-2 magnetic rack, and add the lysate from Step C1.Incubate at 4 °C for overnight with head over tail rotations.Separate the beads with magnetic rack and wash twice with 300 μl of home-made tagmentation buffer (Recipe 6) by resuspending the beads with 1,000 μl pipette. Pulse-spin the tubes on micro centrifuge and separate again with DynaMag-2 magnetic rack, remove the buffer as much as possible without disturbing the beads.Tagmentation, reverse cross linking, and Phenol:Chloroform extractionResuspend the beads in 20 μl of 1x tagmentation buffer containing 1 μl of Tn5 transposase (from NEXTERA XT DNA Library prep Kit).Incubate the resuspended beads at 37 °C for 40 min in a thermoblock with constant shaking at 500 rpm.Remove tagmentation buffer by separating the beads on DynaMag-2 magnetic rack and wash the beads as following:Once with 140 mM RIPA;Four times with 250 mM RIPA (Recipe 4);Twice with TE buffer (Recipe 5).Note: Each wash should be for 3 min and with 200 μl of wash buffer. All the washes should be performed in cold room operating at 4 °C. Resuspend the washed beads in 100 μl of TE buffer, and add 5 μl of 20 mg/ml proteinase K. Incubate the beads for at least 6 h at 60 °C in thermoblock with shaking at 500 rpm.Add 100 μl of TE buffer, followed by 300 μl of Phenol:Chloroform. Vortex the tubes briefly and transfer the content to the phase lock tube (pre-spun at 14,000 rpm for 30 s). Centrifuge the tubes at 20,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature.Transfer the upper aqueous phase to fresh DNA low bind tube, add 5 μl of 20 mg/ml of glycogen and 20 μl of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) in the exact order, vortex briefly.",
    "Add 700 μl of absolute ethanol and vortex briefly. Incubate overnight at -80 °C to precipitate.Centrifuge the tubes at full speed (20,000 x g ) at 4 °C for 30-45 min. Wash the pellet once with 75% ethanol by centrifuging at 20,000 x g at 4 °C for 10 min and resuspend the pellet in 30 μl of TE buffer.PCR amplification and purificationSet up the PCR reaction as per the following reaction mix.Forward primer (Universal) 20 μM: 2 μlReverse primer (with index) 20 μM: 2 μlReverse cross-linked material: 30 μlNuclease free water: 16 μl2x NEBNext High-Fidelity PCR Mix: 50 μlRun the PCR reaction in a thermal cycler with heated lid set at 105 °C, according to following cycling parameter:72 °C for 3 min{98 °C for 10 s63 °C for 30 s72 °C for 30 s}, 12 cycles72 °C for 5 minHold at 4 °C.In the meantime, when PCR reaction is running, remove the Ampure XP beads from 4 °C to room temperature. The Ampure beads should be left at room temperature for at least 30 min to equilibrate, prior to use.Add 0.2x volume (relative to PCR reaction volume) of Ampure XP beads to the PCR reaction and incubate at room temperature for 5 min. Separate the beads on DiaMag 0.2 ml magnetic rack and carefully transfer the solution without carrying over the beads to a new PCR tube. Discard the Ampure XP beads.Add 0.8x volume of Ampure XP (relative to PCR reaction volume) beads to the solution and incubate at room temperature for 5 min. Separate the beads on DiaMag 0.2 ml magnetic rack and carefully discard the solution without disturbing the beads.Wash the beads twice with 200 μl freshly prepared of 80% ethanol, without disturbing the beads.",
    "Dry the beads until the appearance of the bead surface turns from glossy to matte.Elute the finished library in 10-15 μl of nuclease free water.Quality control of librariesMeasure the concentration of the library with Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Kit, following the manufacture’s protocol.Run the library on a DNA High Sensitivity Chip with Agilent Bioanalyzer, to check for size distribution of the DNA fragments. Follow the protocol provided with the DNA High Sensitivity Kit for loading and running the sample.Determine the molar concentration of the library and dilute it to 10 nM concentration or per the requirement of the sequencing facility.Note: The concentration of the library and average size fragment of the library (as revealed by Bioanalyzer) is used to calculate the molar concentration. The formula employed to calculate the concentration is, concentration in nM = (concentration in ng/μl from Qubit measurement)/ (660 g/mol x average size of the library) x 106."
