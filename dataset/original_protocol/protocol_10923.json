    "The Institutional Review Boards of Kent State University and Stetson University have approved all methods described here.\n1. Eligible Participants\nNOTE: The purpose of this research is to understand reading processes in skilled adult readers. Thus, certain eligibility requirements must be met. Such controls ensure that results are directly applicable to a population of skilled adult readers with typical cognitive processes.\nRecruit participants that meet the following eligibility requirements: must be at least 18 years old, have no reading disabilities (dyslexia, alexia, dysgraphia, etc.), have normal or corrected vision (glasses or contacts are acceptable), and speak English as their native language.\n2. Experimental Stimuli\nNOTE: Stimuli construction involves the selection of individual target words as well as the creation of sentence contexts in which those target words are embedded.\nPrepare stimuli for oculomotor corrective regressions.\nSelect a set of at least 30 target words to be embedded into sentences. The target word (wordn) is the word on which word skipping and regressive eye movements will be measured. Select words from an English language corpus, such as CELEX14, which provides word frequencies. Select words that are low frequency, with frequencies lower than 30 counts per million. Choose a three-letter content word to facilitate word skipping.\nSelect the pre-target words (wordn-1) so that the reader is likely to fixate it before skipping or fixating wordn. Again, using an English language corpus, select words that are high frequency, with at least 30 counts per million. Choose a five to seven letter content word to increase the likelihood that it will be fixated and not skipped.",
    "Select the post-target word (wordn+1) so that the reader is likely to fixate it after skipping or fixating wordn. Using the same English language corpus from the previous two steps, select a high frequency preposition that is at least four letters long.\nUsing the words selected in the previous three steps, create sentence contexts in which these three words will be embedded. Place wordsn-1, wordn, and wordn+1 in the middle of the sentence. See step 2.2.6 for some example stimuli.\n\t\t​NOTE: Sentences should be neutral in context without any emotionally charged language. The sentence frames need to be written so that that the overall sentence is grammatical and that wordsn-1, wordn, and wordn+1 fit smoothly into the sentence frame. The target wordn should not be predictable from the context that precedes it (see step 2.2.5 for information about norming to ensure that target words are not predictable).\nAfter sentence frames are created, norm the stimuli using a cloze task to ensure that the target wordn is not predictable from the sentence context.\n\t\t\nIn this task, recruit a separate set of participants.\nHave these participants view each sentence context up until the target word, without including the target, and produce a word that they think best fits the sentence.\nLet the participants complete this task using pen and paper or enter words on a computer using a program or any other software package for behavioral research.\nNOTE: If the target word is produced by more than 20% of participants, then it is considered predictable from the sentence context and must be replaced with a less predictable word and normed again. In the original experiment11, 100 participants completed the cloze task, and no target word was predicted from the preceding context.",
    "See an example sentence below. In this sentence, green is wordn-1, gem is the three-letter low-frequency unpredictable wordn, and around is wordn+1. In this experiment, the target word was controlled to be low frequency (mean = 10.54 counts per million, standard deviation = 6.97)14.\n\t\tThe actress wore a green gem around her neck at the awards show.\n\t\tAnother set of 10 experimental stimuli are presented below from the original experiment14.\n\t\tHe stared at the large urn across the room.\n\t\tShe was afraid of the black fox until it wagged its tail.\n\t\tHe tried to grab the small eel from the pond.\n\t\tShe wanted to see the great zoo inside of the new theme park.\n\t\tThey walked around the whole gym after their workout.\n\t\tThe child asked the young elf about working in Santa's shop.\n\t\tThere was always a short cot under the bed at her cousin's house.\n\t\tThere was really heavy fog along the coastline this morning.\n\t\tHe placed his right ski above his left one when he performed the trick.\n\t\tShe performed her first gig since she wrote some new songs.\nPrepare stimuli for comprehension-based regressions.\n\t\nObtain sentence contexts for this experiment by adapting from a previous study that already has normed sentence frames with ambiguous homophones12. Download this article and view Appendix A, which provides neutral sentence frames that end with an ambiguous homophone.",
    "Using these sentence frames, write the second half of the sentence that disambiguates the homophone to its subordinate meaning. Determine the subordinate meaning of the target word using the University of South Florida homograph norms15. For example, the subordinate meaning of the homophone grade is \"hill incline\" while the dominant meaning is \"evaluation scale.\" Thus, for the sentence \"Mike didn't like the grade…\" add \"…of the hill that they were driving down.\" This ending makes it so that the ambiguous homophone \"grade\" is disambiguated to its subordinate meaning by the word \"hill.\" Each sentence should have two short function words between the ambiguous homophone and the words that disambiguates it. Another set of 10 example sentences are presented below14\n\t\tBarbara examined the corn on her foot after it became painful.\n\t\tBen finally noticed the bluff when the trail suddenly ended.\n\t\tBetty searched for the file for her nails since they were torn.\n\t\tDebbie liked the case that the lawyer decided to take on.\n\t\tEveryone noticed the crab when he whined about everything.\n\t\tFred closely examined the table and the chart in the report.\n\t\tHarry didn't like the suit that was filed against him.\n\t\tHe was happy about the press when the wrinkle was removed from his pants.\n\t\tHelen looked at the cardinal in the church on Sunday.\n\t\tIt was a very bad sentence that the judge delivered to the defendant.\n\t\tJen easily saw the ruler and the queen at the palace.\n3. Comprehension Check",
    "Verify that all participants are reading for comprehension throughout the experiment. Thus, randomly present a series of comprehension questions throughout the experiment. Use simple statements that are followed by a yes or no question to ensure that the participant was comprehending each sentence. Present the comprehension questions separately from the sentence. Eye movement patterns may be different when a participant is not paying close attention to the text. Remove data from any participant who scores less than 80% accuracy on the comprehension questions from data analysis. There should be comprehension questions on at least 10% of trials. Comprehension questions should follow filler sentences, not experimental sentences. An example of four comprehension questions are presented below:\n\tSentence:      Christina went to California with her parents last year.\n\tQuestion:       Did Christina go to Vermont last year?\n\tSentence:      After Mark graduated from college he found a job immediately.\n\tQuestion:       Did Mark fail to find a job?\n\tSentence:      The telephone rang just as Samantha crawled into bed.\n\tQuestion:       Did someone call Samantha last night?\n\tSentence:      The tourists regretted not being able to stay longer in Florida.\n\tQuestion:       Did the tourists want to stay longer?\n4. Eye Tracking Procedure\nRecruit at least 50 participants for each experiment (oculomotor control and comprehension-based regressions) to ensure sufficient data for analyses; drop trials without regressions. Prepare at least 40 experimental stimuli for each experiment, with at least 10 comprehension questions, and at least 20 filler sentences for each experiment. Each experiment should take approximately 30 minutes to complete.\nUse an eye-tracker with a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz, which means that eye positions are measured 1,000 times per second. Measure the eye movements from the right eye.",
    "NOTE: This sampling rate is important as eye movement behavior is extremely fast, and a sample rate of less than 1,000 Hz might not be sensitive enough to capture all cognitive processing.\nHave the participants seated about 60 cm (24 in.) away from a computer screen. Use a 21 in. screen or other screens for the original experiment14.\n\t\nTo stabilize head movements, have participants rest their chin on a chin rest. Allow participants to adjust the height of the chin rest and chair until they are comfortable.\nInstruct the participants to rest their fingers on a \"yes\" button and a \"no\" button that they will use to answer comprehension questions.\nTo calibrate participants' eye positions, use a nine-dot calibration. Instruct the participants to gaze at a white circle in the center of a black screen. Participants will move their eyes to the white circle as it moves around to eight other positions on the screen. Have the participants keep their eyes on the circle until it moves to a new position.\n\t\nAfter calibration, validate eye positions. If participants' eye positions are corrected within one degree of visual angle, then ask the participants move on to the reading portion of the study.\nHave each sentence appear one at a time in random order in the center of the screen. Use any monospaced font such as Courier so that all characters take up the same amount of space on the participant's retina. Intermix filler sentences and comprehension sentences (followed by questions) with experimental sentences.",
    "Prior to each sentence, have the participant gaze at a white circle on the left side of the screen that corresponds to the position of the first letter of the first word. When participants are looking at this position, have the experimenter press a button that controls the onset for reading.\nNOTE: This experiment uses self-paced reading, so the participant will press the \"yes\" button when they have finished reading the sentence. After reading each sentence, the white circle will appear on the screen again and the process will repeat with the next sentence.\nPerform a drift correct prior to each sentence to ensure that calibration remains accurate. If the eye position is off by more than one degree of visual angle, recalibrate the participant's eye positions.\n5. Quantitative Analysis of Data\nAfter all data have been collected, open the program DataViewer, and load in all data files in .edf format if using EyeLink software. Delete fixation durations that are fewer than 100 ms or longer than 1,000 ms as these do not reflect linguistic processing.\nNext, run an Interest Area Report to gather the desired eye movement behavior measures from each word of interest: wordn, and wordn+1. Set interest areas around these items using a delimiter and the default settings for interest area size in Experiment Builder. Select several variables in order to determine the type of regressive eye movement and the presence or absence of an IOR effect:\n\tIA_SKIP: This variable indicates whether wordn was skipped. This is important to determine whether the regression to wordn is a return or non-return regression.",
    "IA_REGRESSION_IN: This variable indicates whether a regression was made into wordn. Only analyze trials in which this value is 1, otherwise it is not relevant for IOR analyses because no return eye movement was made to this target.\n\tIA_REGRESSION_OUT: This variable indicates whether a regression was made out of wordn+1. Only analyze cases in which this variable is 1, which indicates that a return eye movement was made.\n\tIA_FIRST_RUN_DWELL_TIME: This variable is a measure of how long the reader spent on wordn+1 on the first pass through the sentence. This duration indicates the amount of processing it took before a regressive eye movement was made. This duration will include any potential inhibition time before a regressive eye movement.\nNow that each trial has been categorized, have the researcher inspect each trial individually to determine whether it counts as an oculomotor- or comprehension-based regressive eye movement. Only inspect trials where IA_REGRESSION OUT of wordn+1 is 1 and where IA_REGRESSION_IN to wordn is 1.\n\t\nIn DataViewer, select the participant's data, and open each trial. Click through each fixation to inspect whether the regression out of wordn+1 was made directly into wordn after it has been fixated or skipped. If so, mark this trial to be included in analyses in the data file. Do not include trials where a regression was made to an earlier part of the sentence or when a regression was made out of wordn+1 after processing other parts of the sentence.\nAfter all trials have been marked, analyze data using linear mixed effects models with the languageR and lme4 packages in R Studio16. Specify random slopes and intercepts for both participants and items. Fixed effects should include skipping of the target word and regressions into the target word.\nSubscription Required.
