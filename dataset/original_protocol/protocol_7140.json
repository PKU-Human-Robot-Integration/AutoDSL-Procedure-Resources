    "General notesPrescreen participants for any contraindication to the stimuli (e.g., diabetes, food allergies, forearm skin conditions).Prescreen participants to only include those who indicate liking the proposed food and touch stimuli (i.e., milk, cocoa milk, receiving forearm caresses).Ask participants not to eat in the four hours preceding the experiment (Note 2).To carry out the present paradigm, approval from the local ethics commission is necessary. The protocol does not pose major physical or psychological risks for participants; however, each participant must be informed about the main procedures beforehand and must be free to interrupt the procedures at any moment, without providing further explanations.Task DescriptionGeneral descriptionThe task delivers social (i.e., touch) and nonsocial (i.e., food) rewarding stimuli in segregated blocks.Touch stimuli consist of gentle caresses, delivered at specific speeds by a trained experimenter to the participant’s forearm. Food stimuli consist of sweet milk with different concentrations of cocoa, delivered through a tubing system to the participant’s mouth. The task entails three different levels of reward magnitude (high, low, very low), tailored on the subjective ranking performed by the participant before the main task (see point E.2). The reward magnitudes differ in the pace at which caresses are delivered, and in the concentration of cocoa in the administered milk.In each trial, a high or low possible reward is announced. Participants obtain the reward if their effort pressing the hand dynamometer is sufficient, otherwise, the very low reward is delivered.The paradigm allows to record aspects of reward processing in humans with different measures (self-report, physical effort, facial responses) and across four crucial phases: pre-effort anticipation (announcement of possible reward), post-effort anticipation (waiting for upcoming reward), delivery (reward consumption), and relax (reward appreciation).VariablesThe task allows the manipulation of:Type of reward (2): social (i.e., touch) and nonsocial stimuli (i.e., food).",
    "Magnitude of reward (2/3): high, low, very low (not for pre-effort anticipation).The task allows the measurement of (Note 3):Wanting of the possible reward, as explicit subjective rating.Wanting of the possible reward, as effort/force applied to the dynamometer.Liking of the obtained reward, as explicit subjective rating.DesignTwo blocks for each type of reward; interleaved (i.e., ABAB/BABA).Sixteen trials for each block; 8 high and 8 low possible rewards. Note that despite the same number of high and low possible rewards being announced, the number of high, low, and very low rewards obtained may differ per participant, as this is determined by the force that participants exert trail-by-trial, to obtain the possible rewards (and by chance, as force is converted into probability).StimuliEach stimulus is associated with one representative icon (Figure 1).Social (touch)A trained experimenter (Note 4) administers caresses to the participant’s forearm. Using the extended index and middle finger, deliver a continuous back and forth movement at paced speed as prompted by auditory cues. Apply very soft pressure (as for tickling) over a 9 cm-long area on the posterior (hairy) side of participant’s forearm (we chose to caress the left instead of the right forearm for practical reasons). Consider the use of a dry powder or (gluten free) flour to smoothen the skin-to-skin contact and avoid unpleasant rubbing (depends also on room and skin temperature). The following pace of caresses was chosen based on the literature [humans perceive as more pleasant caresses that are in the speed range that elicits C-tactile fiber activation, i.e., 1–10 cm/s (Löken et al., 2009;            Taneja et al., 2021)] and pilot testing.“slow” (pace 6 cm/s)“fast” (pace 21 cm/s)“very fast” (pace 27 cm/s)Nonsocial (food) (Note 5)Syringes attached to electrically-operated and computer-controlled pumps deliver liquid food (milk) through the tubing directly into the participant’s mouth.",
    "The amount of food delivered is constant at 2 mL in each trial. Note that, to control for caloric inconsistencies between cocoa milk and plain milk, we added sugar to the plain milk (see point C.2.c for procedures).“chocolate” (cocoa milk 100%)“mix” (cocoa milk 25% + sugared milk 75%)“milk” (sugared milk 100%)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4325/bioprotoc-12-04-4325-g001.jpgFigure 1. Stimuli and representative icons. A-C. Social touch stimuli; A) “slow”, B) “fast”, C) “very fast”. D-F. Nonsocial food stimuli; D) “chocolate”, E) “mix”, F) “milk”.Trial sequence (Note 6) (Figure 2, Videos 1 and 2)Text, pictures and graphics are displayed on a dark background to limit excessive luminosity in a dim environment. Touch and food trials last on average 38 and 50 s, respectively.Central fixation cross; duration 3 s on average (varying randomly between 2 and 4 s).Announcement of the possible reward; duration 2 s.Icon announces the highest possible reward (i.e., high or low) that the participant can obtain in the current trial.Rating of wanting; duration 4 s.Continuous visual analog scale ranging from “not at all” (left anchor) to “very much” (right anchor). Using the keyboard, participants are instructed to move the cursor along the continuum to express the degree of wanting of the announced possible reward. In each trial, the scale appears with the cursor placed randomly in a central position (25% to the left and right of the midpoint).Physical effort; duration 4 s.An empty bar fills up with red color from bottom (0%) to top (100%) according to the force applied to the hand dynamometer, calibrated on individual maximum voluntary contraction (MVC).Participants are instructed to squeeze the dynamometer according to their desire (wanting) to obtain the announced reward. The likelihood of getting such a reward is directly proportional to the peak of the force exerted (i.e.",
    ", 100% and 0% of MVC exerted correspond to 100% and 0% probability of receiving the announced reward, respectively).Announcement of obtained reward; duration 2 s.Icon announces the obtained reward, either the previously announced (high or low) or the very low reward.Preparation for reward delivery; duration 6 s.Participants are instructed to wait for stimulus delivery. In touch blocks, the trained experimenter receives an auditory cue through earphones priming the pace of the caress to be delivered.Reward delivery; duration 7 s.Icon indicates the stimulus being delivered, either high, low, or very low reward.In touch blocks, the experimenter receives the auditory cue through earphones driving the pace of the caress being delivered; in food blocks, instructions signal 2.5 s of delivery and 4.5 s of swallowing: the pump pushes the plunger for the first 2.5 s delivering the 2 mL of liquid, then pulls the plunger a little, enough to avoid liquid from leaking.Relaxation; duration 6 s.Participants are instructed to relax and enjoy the stimulus they just experienced.Rating of liking; duration 4 s.Identical to the rating of wanting; participants express the degree of liking of the stimulus just experienced.Only for food blocks: preparation for rinsing; duration 5 s.Participants are instructed to expect water delivery.Only for food blocks: rinsing; duration 7 s.Participants receives 2 mL of water to rinse their mouth. Instructions signal 2.5 s of delivery and 4.5 s of swallowing, as for the reward delivery phase.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4325/bioprotoc-12-04-4325-g002.jpgFigure 2. Trial Sequence. Description, screens, duration onscreen, and main phases (colored panels) of the task. A) Touch reward task (average duration 38 s); in this representative trial, the highest possible reward that the participant can obtain is the “slow” touch (e.g.",
    ", high reward); the participant rates the wanting and exerts a strong physical effort; the participant is informed that they have secured the highest possible reward; the participant receives the reward, enjoys the reward, and rates its liking. B) Food reward task (average duration 50 s); in this representative trial, the highest possible reward that participant can obtain is the “mix” (e.g., low reward); the participant provides a medium rating of wanting, and exerts a moderate effort; the participant is informed that they will receive the “milk” (e.g., very low reward) instead; the very low reward is delivered, and after a relax phase the participant rates its liking; water is then delivered to rinse the mouth and prepare for the next trial.Materials preparationAs preparation requires several steps, we advise organizing the setting and materials before the arrival of the participant.RoomSet up a long black curtain to isolate the participant from the rest of the room. Place a table transversal to the curtain. Such disposition prevents the participant from having visual feedback of their forearm while it is being caressed in the touch blocks, and it allows the participant to focus without distractions on the tactile sensation of the caress.On the participant’s side of the curtain (Figure 3A), place a comfortable chair (preferably without castors and moving parts). On the desk in front of the participant, place the supplementary monitor, the hand dynamometer (participants will operate it with their left hand) and the supplementary keyboard (participants will operate it with their right hand). A smaller numeric keypad or a response button box can be used instead. Adjust the mechanical arm that will hold the tubes for food delivery at the height of the participant’s mouth.",
    "On the experimenter’s side of the curtain (Figure 3B), place a small, thin pillow (covered with a fresh paper or tissue, to be replaced for each participant) on the table next to the curtain. Place the laptop close to the pillow running parallel to the curtain. With this setting, during touch blocks the experimenter can control the laptop while comfortably caressing the participant’s forearm that is resting on the pillow.Place the pumps on a flat surface, preferably out of the participant’s sight. We arranged them on a small side table with castors.Food stimuliThoroughly wash hands before handling food stimuli and setting up the pump system.Remove the milk and the cocoa milk from the fridge approximately 30 min before the experiment. Do so consistently across sessions and subjects to minimize major differences in the temperature of the delivered stimuli.Using the scale, add sugar to the milk in order to equalize its caloric content with that of the cocoa milk, then shake. In our case, the declared caloric content per 100 mL is 46 kcal for the milk and 65 kcal for the cocoa milk. To equalize these values, we mix the milk with 4.8 g of sugar, which has 400 kcal per 100 g.Fill the four syringes“Milk” syringe contains 80–100 mL of sugared milk.“Chocolate” syringe contains 80–100 mL of cocoa milk.“Mix” syringe contains 80–100 mL of a mix including 25% of cocoa milk and 75% of sugared milk.“Water” syringe contains 100–120 mL of fresh still water.Remove air bubbles from the syringes.Fix each syringe to the relative pump.Connect the tubes to the syringe tips through the hose-to-Luer connectors.Cut four pieces of tubes of ~10 cm. Connect them to the tubes through the hose barb union connectors.",
    "Tape them together and cut out excessive parts (make sure that tape is not entering the participant’s mouth). These tubes will come in contact with the mouth of the participant, so use new and clean tubes, handle in compliance with the hygienic standards.Tape the tubes to the mechanical arm (Figure 3C).ComputerConnect the supplementary monitor, the supplementary keyboard, the hand dynamometer, the pumps, and the earphones to the laptop. The synergy of these instruments is controlled via Matlab during the task.PumpsActivate the pumps to push the syringes until the tubes are completely filled with the beverages.Preparation of the participantMark the area to be caressed with a felt-tip pen.Keep hand in pronation, mark the head of the ulna.Mark 9 cm on a straight line from the head of ulna towards the belly of the extensor muscles of the hand (towards the elbow), on the hairy side of the forearm.Let the participant sit centrally before the monitor, with their face at ~80 cm.Place their left forearm beyond the curtain, lying comfortably on the pillow.The left hand holds the dynamometer to perform power grip, the right hand controls the keyboard.Assist participants in placing the end of the tubes in their mouth by adjusting the mechanical arm to the optimal position (Figure 3A and 3C).Place a large cup on the table below the end of the tubes to collect leaking drops.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4325/bioprotoc-12-04-4325-g003.jpgFigure 3. Experimental setup. A) Participant’s side: The participant sits in front of the secondary screen; the right hand is on the secondary keyboard; their left arm lies on the pillow beyond the black curtain; computer-controlled pumps push the syringes (these can also be placed elsewhere); the food stimuli flow through the tubes to the participant’s mouth; a mechanical arm holds the tubes.",
    "B) Experimenter’s side: The experimenter sits in front of the computer and participant’s left arm; through the earphones, the experimenter receives prompts for delivering the touch stimuli to the participant’s arm. C) One end of the tubes is tied to the mechanical arm; short tube parts are connected to the tubes and lie in the participant’s mouth.Initial proceduresBefore explaining the task, instruct participants to squeeze the hand dynamometer as strong as possible, performing a power grip for 3 s across three successive trials. Consider the peak value as participant’s MVC. The MVC is used to individually calibrate the dynamometer during the main task. Therefore, it is very important that the hand dynamometer is held in the same position during the MVC measurement and the later experiment.Stimuli ranking (Note 7)Every participant experiences all touch and food stimuli, presented in two separated blocks and pseudo-randomized order.Per each reward type, a complete set of three stimuli is administered, followed by a task asking them to rank the stimuli according to their liking.The individual ranking is entered in the system for the main task and defines the high, low, and very low rewarding stimuli.Instruct the participants about task procedures and dynamics.Task familiarization: participants complete four practice trials (2 touch and 2 food).Task administration (Videos 1 and 2)Task duration is of ~50 min. One touch block lasts ~10 min, one food block lasts ~13 min, one touch trial lasts ~38 s, and one food trial lasts ~50 s.Counterbalance the order of touch and food blocks across subjects.Alternate touch and food blocks.Allow short breaks between blocks, for participants to rest and the experimenter to prepare for a subsequent block.Final proceduresAt the end of the task, we advise collecting a second measure of participant’s MVC. This may reveal muscle fatigue and/or habituation throughout the task.",
    "Remove and discard the tube parts that were in contact with the participant’s mouth. Clean the inside of the tubes with detergent, and rinse with warm water.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1.
