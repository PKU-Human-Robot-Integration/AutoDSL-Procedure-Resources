    "Preparing of bone marrow cells ● TIMING 40 minEuthanize a 3-month-old mouse by cervical dislocation under general anesthesia or other approved methods. CAUTION! All animal procedures must be carried out in accordance with your local animal ethics and experimental safety committees.Sterilize the mouse with 70% ethanol, dissect the hind limbs, and remove the soft tissues by scraping the diaphysis off the bone. Store the bones in cold complete DMEM on ice.Harvest the BMCs in a hood using sterilized equipment. Cut the ends of the tibia and femur just below the end of the marrow cavity. Remove the bone growth plate and insert a 27G needle attached to a 1 mL syringe containing complete medium into the spongy bone. Flush the bone marrow plug out of the shaft with complete medium repeatedly, and collect the plug into a 40 μm basket filter placed in a dish on ice. CRITICAL STEP The flushing can be stopped when the bone marrow cavity is no longer red.Use the end of a new syringe to disperse the marrow plug through the basket filter for removing fat, clustered debris, and other unwanted materials.Pass the cell-containing medium through cell filters into a 15 mL conical tube to obtain a single cell suspension. Centrifuge at 300 × g and 4°C for 10 min to pellet the cells, and then discard the supernatant.Add 10 mL of 1× RBC Lysis Solution into the BMCs from one mouse. Gently vortex for 5 s and incubate for 10 min at room temperature. CRITICAL STEP Avoid the high-speed vortex (Recommended speed ≤ 600 RPM).Centrifuge at 300 × g and 4°C for 5 min and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of cold MACS buffer by pipetting up and down.",
    "Count the cells using a hemocytometer (or automated counting instrumentation if available). CRITICAL STEP It is important to calculate the cell number for determining the quantities of antibodies and MACS microbeads, as well as the size of MACS columns in the following steps. Normally, 5 × 107–7 × 107 total BMCs can be obtained from the hindlimbs of one mouse after RBC lysis.Add another 4 mL of cold MACS buffer to the above cell suspension, centrifuge at 300 × g and 4°C for 5 min, and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the cell pellet in 100 μL of Dead Cell Removal MicroBeads per 107 cells. Mix well and incubate for 15 min at room temperature.Apply the cell suspension in 1 mL of 1× DCB Buffer onto the pre-washed LS column in the magnetic field of the MACS separator. Collect the negative cells that passed through the column. Rinse the column with 3 mL of DCB Buffer thrice and collect all effluent as the live cell fraction (normally 70-80% of the cells from the last step could be collected after dead cell removal). Centrifuge the live cell suspensios at 300 × g and 4°C for 5 min, and discard the supernatant.Resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of cold MACS buffer. Count the cells using a hemocytometer (or automated counting instrumentation if available), then proceed to primary antibody labeling.Magnetic isolation of CTR+ and CTR– cells ● TIMING 2 h 20 minCentrifuge the above cell suspension at 300 × g and 4°C for 5 min, and discard the supernatant. Then, resuspend the cell pellet with 2 μg of Biotin-conjugated CTR antibody and OSCAR antibody in 200 μL of MACS buffer per 107 cells. Incubate in the dark at 4°C for 30 min.",
    "Wash the cell suspensions with 5 mL of cold MACS buffer and centrifuge at 300 × g and 4°C for 5 min. Repeat the washing steps twice. CRITICAL STEP To reduce the unbound primary antibody, it is important to wash the cells at least twice following antibody labeling.Resuspend the cells with 20 μL of anti-Biotin MultiSort Microbeads in 80 μL of cold MACS buffer per 107 cells. Incubate in the dark at 4°C for 15 min.Wash the cell suspension with 5 mL of cold MACS buffer and centrifuge at 300 × g and 4°C for 10 min. Repeat the washing steps twice and resuspend the cells in 500 μL of cold MACS buffer.Proceed to magnetic separation. Insert the LS column with the column wings to the front into a MACS separator. Prepare the LS column by rinsing it with cold MACS buffer: apply 2 mL of degassed MACS buffer on top of the column and allow the MACS buffer to run through. Discard the effluent and change the collection tube. CAUTION! The columns are “flow stop” and do not run dry. The maximum sample size for an LS column is 1 × 108 labeled cells in 2 × 109 total cells.Apply the cell suspensions onto the prepared LS column. Collect the effluent that passes through. Wash the LS column for thrice by adding 3 mL of degassed MACS buffer each time when the column reservoir is empty. Collect the total effluent containing the CTR– cells.Remove the LS column from the separator and place it on a new collection tube. Pipette 5 mL of MACS buffer onto the LS column. Immediately flush out the fraction with magnetically labeled cells, by firmly applying the plunger supplied with the column. CAUTION! The flushed cells in this step are the CTR+ cells.",
    "To increase the purity of magnetically separated CTR+ cells, repeat the magnetic separation procedure as described in Steps 5–7 with a new column.Centrifuge the CTR– cell fraction in Step 6 and the CTR+ cell fraction in Step 7 at 300 × g and 4°C for 10 min. Discard the supernatants, and proceed to the next step for eluting the magnetic beads.Magnetic separation of OSCAR+CTR+ and OSCAR+CTR– cells ● TIMING 2 hResuspend the above cell pellet of each cell fraction with 1 μL of MultiSort Release Reagent in 100 μL of cold MACS buffer per 107 cells. Mix well and incubate at 4°C for 10 min. Wash the cells with 1 mL of the cold MACS buffer per 107 cells and centrifuge at 300 × g and 4°C for 10 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 50 μL of cold MACS buffer per 107 cells. Add 30 μL of MultiSort Stop Reagent per 107 cells into the cell suspensions and mix well. Centrifuge the above cell suspensions at 300 × g and 4°C for 5 min. CRITICAL STEP The anti-Biotin MultiSort microbeads are removed from the cells at this step, which allows for a second-round of magnetic separation of the OSCAR+ cells.Resuspend the above cell pellet of each cell fraction in 1 mL of cold MACS buffer. Count the cells using a hemocytometer (or automated counting instrumentation if available). Centrifuge the above cell suspensions at 300 × g and 4°C for 5 min and discard the supernatants. Then, resuspend the cell pellets with 20 μL of anti-Rat IgG Microbeads in 80 μL of cold MACS buffer per 107 cells and incubate in the dark at 4°C for 15 min.",
    "Wash the cell suspensions with 5 mL of cold MACS buffer and centrifuge at 300 × g and 4°C for 10 min. Repeat the washing steps twice, and resuspend the cells in 500 μL of cold MACS buffer.Proceed to the magnetic separation. Insert the MS column with the column wings to the front into a MACS separator. Prepare the MS column by rinsing with cold MACS buffer: apply 500 μL of degassed MACS buffer on top of the column and let the MACS buffer run through. Discard the effluent and change the collection tube. CAUTION! The columns are “flow stop” and do not run dry. The maximum sample size for an MS column is 1 × 107 labeled cells in 2 × 108 total cells.Apply the CTR+ and CTR– fractions cell suspensions onto the prepared MS column. Collect the effluent that passes through. Wash the MS column thrice by adding 500 μL of degassed MACS buffer each time when the column reservoir is empty. Collect the total effluent, which contains the OSCAR– cells (non-OLCs).Remove the MS column from the separator and place it on a new collection tube. Pipette 1 mL of MACS buffer onto the MS column. Immediately flush out the fraction with magnetically labeled cells, by firmly applying the plunger supplied with the column. CAUTION! The flushed cells in this step are the OSCAR+CTR+ (MOCs) and OSCAR+CTR– cells (OCPs), respectively.Centrifuge the desired cell fractions at 300 × g and 4°C for 10 min to pellet the cells, and discard the supernatant. The cell pellets can proceed to RNA extraction for gene expression assays, e.g., RT-PCR and microarray, or protein extraction for western blot.",
    "Alternatively, resuspend the cell pellets in appropriate cell culture medium for osteoclastogenic cell culture, followed by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining and bone resorption assay, for measuring the osteoclast activity in vitro. CRITICAL STEP Trypan blue staining is performed for counting viable cells."
