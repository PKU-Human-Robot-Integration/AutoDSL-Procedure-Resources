    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of California San Francisco (San Francisco, CA; IRB #14-13895) and the Children's National Health System (Washington, D.C.; IRB #1339). Specimens were collected and studied after obtaining informed consent from the patient or patient's guardian.\n1. Consenting Patients Under IRB Protocol for Collection and Storage of Biological Specimens\nCollect patient samples after written informed consent is obtained from each patient, or the patient's guardian, for participation in a clinical trial or for biorepository as approved by the respective Institutional Review Board.\nPatients included in this study were diagnosed with a brain tumor radiographically. No exclusion criteria were used. Specimens were collected and studied after obtaining informed consent from the patient or patient's guardian.\n2. Blood Collection and Separation of Plasma or Serum\nCollect the blood sample using a 10.0 mL draw into blood collection tubes. If collecting blood for plasma, use K2- or K3-EDTA tubes, heparin or cfDNA blood collection tubes. If collecting blood for serum, use gel-barrier tubes containing the clot activator and gel to separate serum.\nNOTE: While 10 mL is recommended to enable replicate experiments, a minimum of 3 mL will suffice.\nCarefully invert the collection tube 10 times to mix the blood sample with the collection tube reagents.\nLeave the blood samples from which the serum will be collected at room temperature for 30 min to allow blood to clot. If processing blood to obtain plasma, proceed immediately to step 2.4.\nNOTE: Samples being processed for plasma may be kept on ice for a maximum of 2 h prior to centrifugation. However, a rapid transition from the blood draw to processing minimizes cfDNA degradation.",
    "Centrifuge blood collection tubes at 2,000 x g for 15 min in a centrifuge set to 4 °C to separate plasma or serum from white and red blood cell layers.\nTaking care not to disturb the white blood cell layer (which forms a thin line between the upper plasma/serum layer and lower layer of packed red blood cells), pipette the top layer of plasma/serum (which may be clear, yellow, or pink in color) equally in 1 mL aliquots into sterile polypropylene screw-cap cryovials.\nRecord the subject identification number, specimen type (plasma or serum), and collection date on the label of the cryovials.\nStore cryovials in the -80 °C freezer until use. If a -80 °C freezer is not available, store the samples at -20 °C for up to one week.\n3. CSF Collection and Processing\nCollect CSF from a shunt, lumbar puncture, or surgery.\nNOTE: Such procedures should only be conducted if deemed necessary by clinicians. Extra sample beyond that which is necessary for clinical use may be used for research purposes.\nMeasure the volume of CSF collected and make note of its color (bloody, yellow, clear).\nCentrifuge the collection tube at 10,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet the cellular debris.\nTransfer the CSF supernatant equally in 500 µL aliquots into polypropylene screw cap cryovials.\nRecord the subject identification number, specimen type, and date of specimen collection on the label of the cryovials. Store at -80 °C until use.\n4. Extraction of cfDNA from Liquid Specimens\nPerform cfDNA extraction protocol as per the instructions in the cfDNA extraction kit handbook12.\nClean the bench space and equipment with 10% bleach and 70% ethanol.",
    "NOTE: Use of a PCR hood, regular changing of gloves and frequent decontamination of the bench space and equipment with 10% bleach and 70% ethanol during all steps of the protocol is important to avoid sample contamination.\nPrepare aliquots of reagents, e.g., wash buffers, from the extraction kit to avoid cross-contamination.\nThaw patient samples on ice prior to beginning the extraction. For plasma/serum, thaw 1 mL aliquot of sample. For CSF, thaw 500 µL aliquot of sample.\nNOTE: Lysis steps (4.5-4.8) of the extraction protocol differ between plasma/serum and CSF, but from step 4.9 onwards, the protocol is identical for both types of biofluids.\nSet a heating block to 60 °C for use during the lysis step (4.6).\nPrepare the lysis buffer and carrier RNA mixture in a 15 mL tube by adding 5.6 µL of carrier RNA and 0.9 mL of lysis buffer per sample12.\nFor plasma/serum, add 100 µL proteinase K, 1 mL of sample, and 0.8 mL of lysis buffer/carrier RNA mixture prepared in step 4.4 to a labeled 2.0 mL tube. Mix by pulse vortexing for 30 s at high speed12.\nFor CSF, add 125 µL proteinase K, 500 µL of the sample, 1 mL of lysis buffer/carrier RNA mixture, and 250 µL tissue lysis buffer to a 2.0 mL tube. Bring the full volume up to 2 mL by adding 125 µL of 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Mix by pulse vortexing for 30 s at high speed12.\nIncubate samples for 30 min at 60 °C in the heating block12.\nRemove samples from the heating block and lower the temperature to 56 °C. Return samples to the bench and transfer the lysate into new labeled 15 mL tubes.\nFor plasma/serum, add 1.8 mL of nucleic acid binding bufferand mix for 30 s by pulse vortexing12.",
    "For CSF, add 3.6 mL of nucleic acid binding buffer and mix for 30 s by pulse vortexing12.\nIncubate samples for 5 min on ice12.\nInsert the column into the vacuum connector. Open the column and insert a 20 mL tube extender into the column12.\nPipette the contents of the 15 mL tube directly into the bottom of the tube extender, avoiding leaving droplets on the walls of the tube extender.\nWith the switch of the vacuum connector closed, switch on the vacuum pump. Once the pressure has built to 900 mbar, open the valve of the vacuum connector. The sample will now flow through the column.\nOnce all the lysate has been drained from the column, turn off the pump and open the trapdoor to the vacuum connector, relieving the pressure gradient. Once the pressure reaches 0 mbar, close the valve of the vacuum connector and the trapdoor.\nRemove the 20 mL tube extender, being careful not to pass the extender of one column over a neighboring column, as this can cross-contaminate samples. Dispose of the tube extender.\nAdd 600 µL of first wash buffer to the column12.\nLeave lids of tubes open and turn on the vacuum pump. Let the pressure gauge reach 900 mbar, then turn the switch on the vacuum connector to the open position to draw the wash buffer through the column.\nTurn off the vacuum pump, open the trapdoor to release pressure, and relieve the pressure to 0 mbar. Turn valve of the vacuum connector to the closed position.\nAdd 750 µL of second wash buffer to the column and repeat steps 4.16-4.1712.\nAdd 750 µL of MB grade ethanol to the column and repeat steps 4.16-4.1712.",
    "Close the lid of the column and place the column inside a new 2.0 mL collection tube. Dispose of the vacuum connector12.\nCentrifuge the tube with the column at 20,000 x g for 3 min at room temperature12.\nPlace the column into a new collection tube and open the lid of the tube. Place a laboratory tissue over the top and incubate at 56 °C for 10 min12.\nPlace the column into a clean 1.5 mL PCR-clean tube and pipette 100 µL of elution buffer (or molecular biology grade H2O (MB H2O)) directly into the center of the column. Do not touch the column with a pipette tip. Close the lid and leave at room temperature for 3 min.\nCentrifuge at 20,000 x g at room temperature for 1 min to elute cfDNA12.\nPipette the eluate back into the column and incubate at room temperature for 3 min.\nRepeat the centrifugation at full speed for 1 min to elute cfDNA a second time to increase yield (as per manufacturer's recommendation).\nStore cfDNA in labeled DNase/RNase free PCR-clean tubes at 4 °C or proceed directly to step 5.\n5. Vacuum Concentration of cfDNA\nInsert and balance the tubes containing eluted cfDNA into holders on the vacuum concentrator. Open the lids of the tubes. Set the temperature of vacuum concentrator to 23 °C.\nTurn on the vacuum concentrator, then turn on the vapor trap. Centrifuge samples for 40 min or until a final volume of 10.5-11 µL is reached.\nIf the volume is below 10.5 µL, add DNA suspension buffer or MB H2O to reach a final volume of 10.5 µL.\nPipette the full volume along the walls of the tube to remove residual DNA fragments.",
    "Briefly centrifuge the samples on a tabletop centrifuge to collect droplets on the walls of the tubes.\nProceed directly to the preamplification step (step 8) or store samples at 4 °C.\n\t\nWrap lids of tubes in a laboratory film to avoid contamination if they are stored for later use.\n6. Design and Preparation of Primers and Probes\nDesign forward and reverse primers, and wildtype and mutant LNA probes, for the target(s) of interest. Commercially order lyophilized primers and probes (refer to Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Sequences for primers and probes targeting H3F3A p.K27M and other target mutations for pediatric midline gliomas can be found in Supplementary Table 3 of Panditharatna et al., 20188.\nPrior to opening the lyophilized primers and probes, briefly centrifuge the tubes. Add the appropriate volume of DNA suspension buffer or MB H2O, as noted on the product specification sheet, to resuspend the lyophilized primers and probes to a concentration of 100 µM.\nGently vortex, pipette up and down several times to mix and briefly centrifuge primers and probes using a tabletop centrifuge.\nPrepare 10 µM aliquots of primers and probes by adding 10 µL of 100 µM stock to 90 µL of DNA suspension buffer or MB H2O.\nPrepare 1 µM aliquots of forward and reverse primers (to be used for preamplification), by adding 10 µL of the 10 µM primer to 90 µL of DNA suspension buffer or MB H2O.\nStore primers and probes at 4 °C in air-tight dark containers. Wrap laboratory film around lids to avoid contamination, and cover probes in aluminum foil to avoid exposure to light. Store probes at -20°C for long term storage if they are not being used regularly.\n7. Selection of Positive Controls",
    "Select tumor tissue genomic DNA (gDNA) sample(s) with known DNA concentration, which harbors the mutation of interest at a known allelic frequency to be used as a positive control.\nUse 0.025 ng of positive control tumor tissue DNA in the preamplification step (step 8).\n\t\tNOTE: This DNA input provides a robust positive signal on dPCR (as determined by performing serial dilutions of tumor tissue gDNA harboring H3F3A p.K27M mutation8) while minimizing the amount of sample required.\n8. Preamplification of Target Alleles\nNOTE: Preamplification protocol is as per Jackson et al., 201613.\nClean the bench space and equipment with 10% bleach and 70% ethanol.\nObtain 1 µM forward and reverse primers, cfDNA samples, gDNA positive controls, and DNA polymerase master mix, and set on ice.\nCalculate the volume of reagents needed to preamplify the desired number of cfDNA samples and positive control, for either singleplex or multiplex preamplification as follows:\nFor singleplex preamplification (to preamplify wildtype and mutant alleles for a single mutation of interest), prepare PCR reaction mixture by adding 17.5 µL of DNA polymerase master mix, and 3.5 µL of forward and reverse primers (100 nM) per sample13.\nFor multiplex preamplification (to preamplify two sets of wildtype and mutant alleles for two mutations of interest), prepare PCR reaction mixture by adding 17.5 µL of DNA polymerase master mix and 1.75 µL of each set of forward and reverse primers (50 nM) per sample13.\n\t\tNOTE: Prepare enough PCR reaction mixture for the number of samples plus 10% extra to account for any pipetting error.\nDispense 24.5 µL of PCR reaction mixture into each well of an 8-well PCR strip tube13.",
    "Dispense 10.5 µL of DNA sample into the appropriate well to bring the total reaction volume to 35 µL13. Gently pipette the full volume up and down 10 times to mix.\nPerform PCR amplification at 98 °C for 3 min; 9 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, annealing temperature for 3 min, 72 °C for 30 s; and an extension at 72 °C for 2 min13.\nTransfer the full volume of preamplified product to labeled DNase/RNase free PCR-clean tubes and dilute in 140 µL TE DNA suspension buffer (pH 8.0)13.\nWrap the lids of the tubes in laboratory film. Store the preamplified product at 4 °C. For long term preservation, store at -20 °C.\n9. Detection and Quantification of Target DNA Using dPCR\nClean the bench space and equipment with 10% bleach and 70% ethanol.\nSet 10 µM primers and probes, genotyping master mix, and DNA samples on ice. Store the droplet stabilizing oil at room temperature.\nGently vortex and briefly centrifuge all reagents except droplet stabilizing oil.\nEnsure that the compressed nitrogen gas cylinder attached to the droplet-generating instrument and the quantification instrument (Table of Materials) is set at 90 psi.\nTurn on the drop-generating instrument and the computer with the instrument software. Launch the software and click Start Initializing.\nRun a high-pressure flush on the drop generating instrument if it has not been used in one week or more.\nPrepare the dPCR reaction mixture for 8 wells of the PCR strip tube plus 10% extra, by adding 220 µL of genotyping master mix, 8.8 µL each of 10 µM wildtype and mutant probes, 39.6 µL each of 10 µM forward and reverse primers, and 17.6 µL of droplet stabilizing oil14.",
    "Gently mix the dPCR reaction mixture by pipetting the full volume up and down 10-20 times. Do not vortex or centrifuge after droplet stabilizing oil has been added to the reaction mixture.\nObtain a PCR 8-well strip tube and dispense 38 µL of dPCR reaction mixture directly into the bottom of each well14. Remove any bubbles with a clean pipette tip.\nNOTE: PCR strip tubes that are interlocked or packed tightly together can result in static electric charges, causing coalescence and noisy signal when analyzing dPCR data. To avoid this, aliquot strip tubes into separate biohazard bags, avoid over-packing the bags, and keep the tubes from rubbing together.\nAdd 12 µL of preamplified DNA sample to the appropriate wells of the PCR strip tube. For the negative control, add 12 µL of MB H2O.\nNOTE: Analyze cfDNA samples in replicate wells. For CSF, analyze at least in duplicate, and for plasma/serum analyze each sample in triplicate.\nGently pipette the full volume up and down 10 times to mix the reaction mixture with the DNA sample.\nObtain a new droplet-generating instrument chip and pipette the full volume from wells 1-8 of the PCR strip tube into the corresponding channels A-H in the chip. Avoid touching the bottom of the channels with a pipette tip.\nObtain a new clean PCR strip tube and insert into the droplet-generating instrument. Scan or manually enter the droplet-generating instrument chip ID into the software on the instrument computer. Enter names for each of the 8 channels. Click Start the run to begin dropletizing samples.\nWhen the dropletization has completed, remove the PCR strip tube and apply strip tube caps.\nTransfer the strip tube to a thermal cycler and balance with another strip tube containing 80 µL of water per well.",
    "Program the thermal cycling conditions14 as: 95 °C for 10 min; 45 cycles of two temperatures: 95 °C for 30 s and annealing temperature for 2 min; 98 °C for 10 min; and hold at 10 °C.\nSet the ramp rate to 0.5 °C/s and set the sample volume to 80 µL14.\nWhen thermal cycling is complete, remove the strip tube and transfer to the quantification instrument. Remove PCR strip caps and replace with high speed caps.\nTurn on the quantification instrument and the connected computer with instrument software. Launch the instrument software and click Setup a Run.\nPlace the strip tube into the quantification instrument.\nObtain a new quantification instrument chip and scan or manually enter the chip ID into the instrument. Insert the chip into the machine.\nPlace the metal shield on top of the chip and close the lid of the instrument.\nIn the computer software, enter a name for the dPCR run and for each of the 8 channels (A-H). Select Fast Mode (which must be used with high speed caps) and click Start to begin the quantification.\nWhen quantification is complete, remove the metal shield (to be saved and reused) and dispose of the PCR strip tube and chip. On the instrument computer, the Run Log will contain result files for each run. Use the .fcs files for each sample to analyze with the analyst software.\n10. Data Analysis\nLaunch the analyst software and open the .fcs files to analyze raw spectral data. Under Analysis View, select Intact. Under Sample View, click the boxes next to each of the 8 samples so that there is a check mark in each box. The software will plot signals for the mutant (FAM) and wildtype (HEX) alleles along the x- and y-axes, respectively .",
    "Use the calculated matrix function to apply for the spectral compensation on intact droplets, as per the manufacturer's instructions15.\nAdjust the axis settings under Axis Options. Set the x-axis to a minimum of 0 and maximum of 30,000, and the y-axis to a minimum of -5,000 and maximum of 10,000. When droplet clusters have been identified, adjust axes to reduce empty space in the graph.\nNOTE: The position of mutant and wildtype clusters will depend on the probes used, the fluorophore and their concentration.\nSelect the sample corresponding to the positive control tumor tissue gDNA to set the negative (cluster closest to the origin), mutant (cluster closest to the x-axis), and wildtype (cluster closest to the y-axis) gates. Ensure that the clusters are distinct and easily identified in a successful assay.\nApply the gate settings for the positive control to all samples by right-clicking on the positive control sample and clicking the option to Apply all settings to selected samples.\nUnder the graphical view, click Multiple Samples tab to view plots for all selected samples. Export the image as a .TIF file.\nUnder the Workspace tab at the top left of the screen, select Export Analysis (csv) and save the analyzed data file as a .csv file.\nOpen the .csv file in spreadsheet software to view negative, wildtype, and mutant droplet counts for each sample. Calculate the MAF by dividing the Poisson corrected mutant droplet count by the sum of the Poisson corrected mutant plus wildtype droplet counts for each sample.\nNOTE: Use the Poisson corrected count because Poisson statistics account for that fact that positive droplets may contain more than a single copy of target DNA, and thus summing the positive droplets may not yield an accurate count16."
