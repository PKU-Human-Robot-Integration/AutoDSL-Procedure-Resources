    "All procedures shown in this protocol have been approved by the IRCM Animal Care Committee.\n1. Ultrasound System and Station Preparation\nStart the ultrasound imaging system and connect the scanhead as well as the physiology controller unit according to the manufacturer's instruction (Figure 1). Choose Cardiac Measurement Program and the scanhead that corresponds to the 30 MHz transducer.\nFill the nosepiece of the scanhead with deionized water. Avoid air bubbles as they interfere with imaging resolution. Place the scanhead with the handle side up on its holder near the imaging platform (Figure 1A).\nDisinfect the imaging platform and working area.\nFill completely the bottle of ultrasound gel to avoid the formation of bubbles and place it upside down in its prewarming container set to 37 °C (Figure 1B).\nVerify the levels of oxygen and isoflurane and the tubing system for anesthesia. One experiment with ~8 embryos would use approximately 15-20 L oxygen.\nPlace the bottles of ophthalmic balm, depilatory cream and electrode gel near the imaging platform (Figure 1B).\nVerify that the infrared heat lamp functions. During training, set the heat level, the position of the lamp and the distance of the lamp to mice in order to maintain constant body temperature and heart rate.\n\tNote: Proper preparation of the system and material is critical. Lengthy procedures may affect the physiologic and hemodynamic characteristics of fetuses as long anesthesia depresses cardiac function by lowering heart rate, blood pressure and blood-oxygenation level. The processing time for ~8 fetuses (average litter size in C57BL/6) should be approximately 1 hr. Other mouse strains may provide a higher number of fetuses, possibly with a larger female size. Training is essential to optimize the processing time.\n2. Mouse Preparation",
    "Anesthetize the pregnant female in a chamber with continuous supply of 2% isoflurane in oxygen (200 ml/min) until it becomes nonresponsive.\nPlace the mouse on the imaging platform in a supine position, adjust the tubing for continuous inhalation of 1.5% isoflurane in oxygen (200 ml/min), and fix the inhalation tube with tape (Figure 2A). Sufficient anesthesia should be confirmed during the procedure by the relaxed posture of the mouse and the absence of any response to tail and toe pinches.\nPlace electrode gel only on the left top and right bottom electrode pads (right fore leg and left hind leg, also called lead II position) for electrocardiography. Lead II position provides better defined upright positive P-wave and QRS complex to determine heart rate. Secure the four paws to each pad using tape (Figure 2A). To prevent dryness of the eyes, apply 1 drop of ophthalmic balm into each eye.\nShave the abdomen from chest to bladder with a hair clipper. Then apply depilatory cream for 2 min and wipe it off with gauze and/or cotton swab to carefully remove any remaining hair. Be careful not to cut the nipples.\nInsert the thermometer prelubricated with electrode gel into the female's rectum to monitor the body temperature (should be maintained at 37±0.5 °C by adjusting an infrared heat lamp placed above the platform). Heart rate should be 450±50 beats/min (bpm). Both temperature and heart rate are displayed on the physiology controller unit (Figure 1B).\n\tNote: Long anesthetization, hair loss and ultrasonic gel (although prewarmed) can lead to hypothermia, which can affect the female's heart rate. If the body temperature drops below 36.5 °C, stop the procedure and modify the position of the heating lamp to adjust the temperature and the heart rate. Wait a couple of minutes before proceeding again.",
    "3. Embryo Identification\nGently press down on the naked abdomen to locate the embryos. Slowly and lightly spread them out to have most of embryos in a single layer under the abdominal surface. In each uterine horn, sacs are linearly connected to each other. Try to respect this order when spreading.\nMark each embryo on the naked abdomen of the female with a permanent marker with their anterior/posterior and dorsal/ventral directions. Knowing the orientation will facilitate locating the heart with the probe. Number the embryos in the right and left horns starting from the cervix (1, 2, 3… and 1', 2', 3'… respectively; Figure 2B).\n\tNote: (i) Avoid spreading the embryos with excessive force. Sketch their locations on a piece of paper to track them (Figure 2C). (ii) C57BL/6 females have ~8 fetuses per litter. However, 0-2 embryos in each litter are located beneath the others, making their imaging impossible. Exclude these embryos from the analysis and assess more litters if needed.\n4. Heart Rate Measurement\nPlace a small amount of prewarmed ultrasound gel on the naked abdomen and spread it evenly. Avoid bubble formation. Add a larger amount of gel (~ 5 ml) on the specific area to image.\nHold the probe in contact with the thick gel layer (10 mm) and gradually move the probe toward the skin while looking for the beating heart. Once the beating heart is visualized on the screen, adjust the angle of the probe to have both ventricles in their largest size in the imaging plane (Figure 2D).",
    "Begin acquiring image. With the forearm resting on the station, place the transducer on the ultrasound gel to obtain a live image on the viewing screen (Figure 2D). Maintaining the ridge of the transducer on the top and clicking the scanhead orientation marker (in the left top corner of the image) allow the coordination of the hand movement and area visualized on the screen.\nStarting from the cervix, move to the closest embryo marked (1 or 1' in right or left uterine horn, respectively) to visualize the beating heart on the screen. Because focal depth is fixed, gently move the probe up/down and sideways without losing contact with gel to obtain the desired image plane.\nPosition the beating heart in the center of the screen within the region indicated by the yellow dashed line representing the focal zone for better data acquisition.\nAcquire the live recording. Obtain the scout image and resume recording (Figure 3A). Once a minimum of 10 sec of stable recording is obtained, stop recording and save.\nProceed to the next embryo.\nOnce all the embryos are analyzed, press \"Browse\" on the keyboard to view the list of the recordings. Play each recorded M-mode tracing and perform multiple measurements (at least 5 per tracing) of the spacing between adjacent peaks (time/flow cycle) to obtain the average heart rate (Figure 3B).\n\tNote: Some protocols suggest using a stationary stand for the scanhead to avoid shaking. However, it restrains the angle of analysis, making the observation of lateral embryos difficult. It also slows down the analysis, as the stand has to be adjusted for each embryo. Holding the scanhead while settling the forearm on the station efficiently minimizes shaking. Training with 5-10 pregnant females is recommended to optimize the outcome.\n5. Genotyping",
    "Using clean surgical scissors and forceps, incise longitudinally the skin and muscle layer of the abdomen. Locate the sacs in each uterus horn and match the numbers. Cut open the yolk sac to expose the embryo in the order used above. If not in a linear arrangement, the sketch of the embryo positions on a piece of paper will be essential once the marks on the skin are no longer visible.\nCut only ~4 mm of tail for genotyping as genomic DNA is very efficiently extracted from embryonic tails.\n\tNote: (i) The surgical procedure may have to be performed in a separate location from the imaging room. However, it is important not to move the mouse and have the surgical procedure on the imaging platform in order to keep track of the numbered embryos. Consult the animal facility manager to optimize the surgical procedure. (ii) The pregnant female rapidly dies due to blood loss as the fetuses are removed for genotyping after imaging. After tail cut, the fetuses are placed 3 min on ice for anesthesia by hypothermia and then decapitated with scissors, as recommended by our Animal Care Committee.\nSubscription Required.
