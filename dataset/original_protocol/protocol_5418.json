    "We describe here how to perform manually the hypothalami perifusion assay following these steps (see Figure 1):imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170814/20170814204738_4851.jpgFigure 1. Perifusion flow chart. After a 2-h perifusion to reach equilibrium, the sampling procedure consists of a 30-min control basal period, a 30-min period during which drugs are added independently or in combination and a 60-min wash with the medium. After each experiment, an appropriate molecule (e.g., KCl) is applied to control the responsiveness of hypothalamic explants and test tissue viability.Prepare sufficient hypothalamic explants perifusion medium for the whole experiment (see Recipes; prepare always fresh and no earlier than one day before, stored at 4 °C).Prepare the stimulation solutions. For example, we have used iso-osmotic 60 mM KCl (see Recipes).Pre-gas some hypothalamic explant perifusion medium with carbogen (5% CO2/95% O2; all pre-gassing and gassing steps use carbogen) in a 50-ml conical tube for at least 15 min. About 10 ml of the pre-gassed medium will be used ice-cold for brain dissection and hypothalamic collection and the other part, about 40 ml, will be used warmed (34-37 °C) in a thermostatic bath for perifusion.Prepare perifusion chamber filters (Biorep) for each chamber (2 per chamber) with a hole puncher. Place one filter at each open end of the chamber (see Figures 2F-2H).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170814/20170814204846_4461.jpgFigure 2. Representative images of the different steps of perifusion experiment. A. Place the mouse brain upside down in a Petri dish containing ice-cold basic medium with the hypothalamus in front of the experimenter (A, B, C and D refer to step 8); B.

    "To avoid damage to hypothalamus, it can be handled with a large plastic/glass pipette; F. Prior to dissection, prepare perifusion chamber filters; G. Sagittal view of the brain showing the hypothalamus position (a circle in dotted-line is drawn around the hypothalamus); H. Put one filter at each end of the perifusion chamber (step 4);  Prefill the perifusion chambers with warmed pre-gassed perifusion medium (as described in step 6); I. Position the hypothalamus in the center of the perifusion chamber (step 9). Close the chamber and put it back in the thermostatic bath at 37 °C (step 10); J. Complete assembly of the experimental set-up with, in line from right to left, a thermostatic bath at 37 °C which contains tubes filled with perifusion medium (tubes are connected one to one with silicon tubing to perifusion chambers), a peristaltic pump flows the perifusion medium, a second thermostatic bath at 37 °C which receives the perifusion chambers (a perifusion chamber is marked by the red dashed line circle) and, left, the outlet of the perifusion chambers is connected with silicon tubing to low protein absorption 1.5 ml microtubes placed on ice to collect fractions. The perifusion medium flows from right to left.Connect with appropriate tubing (low protein absorption tubing such as Teflon tubing) the inlet of the perifusion chambers that will contain the hypothalamic explants to a peristaltic pump on one side and the outlet of the chambers to the tubing for fraction collection on the other side.Prefill the perifusion chambers with warmed pre-gassed perifusion medium. Chambers and tubing will be themselves kept at 34-37 °C in a thermostatic bath.",
    "For every mouse previously euthanized (we use cervical dislocation–chosen method should be fast in order to preserve tissue as much as possible), cut the head and collect the mouse brain in a Petri dish filled with pre-gassed perifusion medium, cooled on ice. To collect the brain, insert the bottom blade of extra thin iris scissors into the foramen magnum, and begin to cut directly up and through the midline of the skull, being careful to keep scissor tips pointed upwards. Then, open the skull using forceps pushing outwards both halves of the skull, thus exposing the brain. Carefully invert the skull: gravity will help the brain to detach from the skull. Using Dumont #7 forceps, carefully slide the forceps along the outer edge of the brain and under the brain from the olfactory lobes, towards the cerebellum. Gently detach the brain from any connective tissue or nerves that prevent it from falling from the skull. Note: We used 8-week old mice. Users will determine this regarding each scientific project. A limitation is of course the volume of the perifusion chamber that receives the hypothalamus. Extract the hypothalami (see Figure 2A). Place the brain upside down in a Petri dish (i.e., the ventral side up and visible and the dorsal side of the brain on the Petri dish bottom) filled with ice-cold perifusion medium (see Figure 2A), cut out the cerebellum and spinal cord parts with a scalpel (see Figure 2B) and isolate the hypothalamus using curved Dumont #7 forceps (see Figure 2C): go carefully as deep as 2 mm around the hypothalamic and circle around them to separate and collect them from the brain. More than one brain can be processed in the same dish.",
    "Collect all hypothalamic explants in another Petri dish (see Figure 2D), filled with pre-gassed perifusion medium cooled on ice.Once all hypothalami are collected, place them immediately in perifusion chambers previously filled, thanks to the peristaltic pump, with gassed and warmed perifusion medium (step 6). Open one end of the chamber and gently deposit the hypothalami in the chamber. Be careful not to block the perifusion flow by having tissues sticking to one end of the perifusion chamber (i.e., don’t push the tissues to close to one end of the chamber or carefully reposition the tissue in the center of the chamber). Close the perifusion chamber (see Figure 2I). Note: We used 3 hypothalami per chamber to increase the quantity of peptide release per chamber in order to be able to quantify the release of MCH with ELISA. The number of hypothalami should be determined depending on the experimental setup and conditions (i.e., the neuropeptide of interest, the stimulation of the hypothalami used to release this peptide, and the peptide quantification method).Place the perifusion chambers containing the hypothalamic explants to the thermostatic bath (34-37 °C) where they will remain during the whole experiment.Perifuse hypothalamic explants with gassed and warm (34-37 °C) perifusion medium for 2 h prior to any stimulation of the hypothalami in order to establish a baseline level of peptide release by hypothalami. The inlet tubing for the chambers is placed in a bottle containing the perifusion medium. The flow of perifusion medium that goes in the chambers is set with a peristaltic pump at the rate of 0.1 ml/1 min. This rate will be used for the whole experiment.Collect 3 fractions of the baseline perifusate (1 fraction per 10 min perifusion, and fractions are collected 10 min apart from each other).",
    "Each fraction from each chamber will be collected in a separate 1.5 ml microtube in which the outlet tubing will have been previously placed. Aliquot the collected 1-ml perifusate and freeze at -80 °C as quickly as possible to avoid peptide degradation.Once the baseline fractions are collected, pause the peristaltic pump to eliminate the risk of introducing air bubble in the superfusion tubing and prepare the tubes with the stimulation medium: the inlet tubing for each chamber should be appropriately placed in the corresponding pre-gassed and warmed stimulation solution before starting the peristaltic pump again. Stimulation will last no longer than 30 min to avoid toxicity and/or desensitization of the tissue. During this step, 3 fractions will be collected (1 fraction = 10 min, fractions are collected 10 min apart from each other). The collected fractions of 1-ml perifusate are aliquoted and freezed at -80 °C rapidly to avoid degradation. Once the stimulation fractions are collected, pause the peristaltic pump and start a 60-min washout period: place the inlet tubing for each chamber into the bottle containing the gassed and warmed (34-37 °C) hypothalamic explant perifusion medium. During this step, 6 fractions will be collected (1 fraction = 10 min, fractions are collected 10 min apart from each other). Aliquot the collected 1-ml perifusate and freeze at -80 °C as soon as possible to avoid degradation.After the washout, you can stimulate again all your hypothalamic explants with the appropriate stimulus to induce the release of your neuropeptide of interest in order to control for the viability of the hypothalamic explants–30 min maximum. During this step, 3 fractions will be collected (1 fraction = 10 min, fractions are collected 10 min apart from each other).",
    "Aliquot the collected 1-ml perifusate and freeze at -80 °C as soon as possible to avoid degradation.Turn off the pump. Hypothalamic explants can be saved for further analysis. Explants are collected either with forceps, delicately, or by centrifugation of the chamber in a microtube at 4 °C (see details on Biorep’s website). Freeze at -80 °C.Wash thoroughly the whole perifusion system (tubing and perifusion chambers) with at least 200 ml of hot autoclaved ultrapure water (pump tubing should be reusable up to 20 times depending on the tubing material).Quantify the amount/concentration of secreted neuropeptides by ELISA, RIA, flow cytometry, mass spectrometry or other suitable method."
