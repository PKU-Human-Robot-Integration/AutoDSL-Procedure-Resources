    "1. Selection and Verification of Matrix Material Properties\nBefore starting the phantom fabrication process (Figure 1), find the absorption and reduced scattering coefficients for the biological tissue of interest at the imaging wavelength(s). Preliminary estimates may be found in the references35,36. However, validation of the optical coefficients might be necessary.\nUsing the look-up tables for absorption coefficient, µa, and reduced scattering coefficient, µs', at 488, 535, 632, and 775 nm wavelengths (Tables 1–4 and Figures 2–3), select the concentrations of India ink and titanium dioxide (TiO2) that approximate the desired optical properties. These recipes are specific to phantoms fabricated with PDMS. As these tables provide experimental data at discrete wavelengths, optimization of the recipe may be required for the specific application.\nFabricate a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) slab of the selected recipe for confirmation of optical properties.\nUsing a 10:1 ratio in weight of PDMS resin to curing agent, pour ingredients into the mixing cup in the following order: PDMS resin, TiO2, India ink, PDMS curing agent.\n\t\tNOTE: Here, we test two recipes: 1) 2 mg TiO2 + 3.5 µL India ink per g PDMS and 2) 1 mg TiO2 + 10 µL India ink per g PDMS. For each recipe, 4.5 g PDMS resin and 0.45 g PDMS curing agent are used with the corresponding amounts of optical particles.\nMix in a speed mixer (see Table of Materials) for 60 s. If TiO2 particles stick to the mixing cup (probable with high concentrations of TiO2), mix by hand to remove the particles from the base of the cup, and mix in the mixer for another 30 s.\nPour the mixture into wells or Petri dishes to make thin (0.1-1 mm) slabs of the mixture.",
    "Degas the slabs for 10 min by placing them in an air-tight negative pressure chamber, then place in a pre-heated oven at 80 °C for 30-60 min. Remove from oven and let cool.\nRemove the cooled polymer slab from its container. Trim off the edges to leave a flat, uniform slab. Measure the thickness of the slab using calipers.\nMeasure transmittance (T) and reflectance (R) of slab(s) using an integrating sphere. Additional details and instructions can be found in the Inverse-Adding Doubling (IAD) manual37.\nTurn on the light source and spectrometer of the integrating sphere setup. Check the alignment of the system to ensure a small, collimated beam is centered on the entry and exit ports of the integrating sphere.\nCalibrate the integrating sphere system.\n\t\t\nTurn off the source, cap the exit port of the integrating sphere, and record three dark spectra.\nTurn the source back on to obtain the transmission reference with the exit port capped and the entrance port empty. Record three spectra.\nObtain reflectance reference measurements using reflectance standard(s). Place each standard at the exit port of the sphere. Record three spectra for each reflectance standard.\nMeasure the transmittance of the slab. With the cap on the exit port, place the slab on the entry port of the integrating sphere for the transmission measurement. Record three spectra.\nMeasure the reflectance of the slab. Remove the exit port cap and place the slab on the exit port for the reflectance measurement. Record three spectra.\nDetermine optical properties using IAD software. A full tutorial on the software can be found in the IAD manual with the software download37,38.\nAverage the three spectra acquired for each measurement.",
    "Using the equations in the IAD manual37, convert these measurements to R and T values. If necessary, condense the files by reducing the sampling rate along the spectrum.\nPrepare the input .rxt file (Supplemental Material 1) for IAD with the wavelengths, reflectance, transmittance, and sample thickness as described in the IAD manual37. Using the command prompt (Windows OS) or terminal (Mac OS), navigate to the correct path. Type \"iad 'input file name'\" to run IAD. The software will produce an output text file with the estimated optical properties.\nIf the optical properties are not within an acceptable range (~15%) of the desired values, modify the recipe accordingly and repeat steps 1.3–1.5.\n2. Preparation of Dissolvable 3D Printed Internal Structure\nDesign internal structure using computer aided design (CAD) software. Convert structure solid model to a stereolithography file for fabrication on a 3D printer. If available, a segmented CT scan can also be converted into a stereolithography file rather than drawing a solid model of the internal structure.\n\tNOTE: The CAD file for the fractal tree structure used here is provided in Supplemental Material 2. The printer used in this paper is an extruding printer, so the part was designed to have break-away support material.\nSelect a dissolvable material for printing, such as poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA) or high-impact polystyrene (HIPS) (see Table of Materials). Print the solid model in this dissolvable material.\nWhen printed parts are sufficiently cooled, break, dissolve, or machine the support material off of the printed part. File or sand off any large imperfections.\nVapor polish the printed part to reduce surface roughness.\nWith the printed part secured in a vice, drill a through hole with clearance for a thin steel or nitinol wire in the base of the printed part.",
    "Thread a stainless steel or nitinol wire through the hole. Bend ends of wire and hook together. This will allow for the part to be fully immersed in acetone vapor within the beaker. Set wire and part aside.\nFill a large beaker roughly 10% full of acetone. Place beaker on a hot plate while heating to 100 °C. CAUTION: Perform this step in a fume hood to prevent inhalation of acetone vapor.\nWhen acetone vapor condensation reaches about halfway up the wall of the beaker, hang the looped wire with the mock airway on a second wire and suspend in acetone vapor for 15–30 s. Ensure printed parts do not touch the beaker walls or each other (if vapor polishing multiple parts at once).\nRemove printed part and suspend over empty beaker or container. Let part dry for at least 4 h.\nVerify the dimensions of the internal structure are within tolerance to the CAD design, as needed. Depending on accuracy requirements, calipers or a 3D laser scanner can be used to measure the structure.\n3. Construction of Heat Resistant Mold\nNOTE: Prepare a leak-proof, heat-resistant mold to form the PDMS phantom. Select a mold geometry to best fit the final phantom design. Here, a reusable rectangular mold is described.\nDesign a solid model base of the mold to 3D print. This mold is designed for a phantom with a base of 1.17 cm x 1.79 cm. The base of the mold has a 1 mm thick and 5 mm deep recess with inner dimensions matching the base of the phantom. This allows the mold to sidings to be removed and the mold to be disassembled and re-used.\nPrint a base for the mold with an inset of sufficient width to secure the sidings of the mold.",
    "Place sidings in the recesses of the mold base. Here, 1 mm thick polycarbonate sheets are used as mold sidings.\nUsing heat resistant tape, seal the edges of the mold. It is imperative that all corners and edges are sufficiently sealed with no bubbles in the tape to prevent any leakage during the molding process.\nPlace a polycarbonate base plate inside the mold prepared in step 3.4. This base plate is the same 1 mm thick polycarbonate sheet as the mold siding and gives the phantom base a smooth surface without the roughness of the 3D printed surface of the mold base. Glue the fully-dried vapor polished part to the base plate. Allow sufficient time for glue to dry.\n4. Fabrication of Polymer Phantom\nNOTE: Use the verified recipe for the bulk matrix material determined in step 1 for the specific application. The protocol here provides the steps for a healthy murine lung tissue phantom at 535 nm with µs' of 40 cm-1 and µa of 2 cm-1. It may be useful to fabricate a second phantom with no optical particles to use as a reference in the fabrication process.\nPour 9.1 g of PDMS resin into a plastic mixing cup. Add 20 mg of rutile TiO2, followed by 35 µl of India ink. Finally add 0.91 g of curing agent to the top of the mixture. Follow the mixing protocol in step 1.3.2.\nPour final polymer mixture into the heat-resistant mold.\nPour a small amount of the mixture into a separate container to create a polymer slab for confirmation of material optical properties. Ensure enough polymer is poured to have a slab of at least 100 µm thickness.",
    "Place both the mock airway mold and the separate slab into a bell jar for degassing. Begin vacuum process. If the polymer in the mock airway mold starts to rise, let the air back into the bell jar to burst the surface bubbles, then begin to pull air again. Repeat this process until the polymer does not rise significantly. This will take between 5-10 min depending on how much air was trapped during step 4.2. Once the PDMS no longer rises, continue to degas for another 15 min.\nAfter degassing, slowly let the air back into the chamber. Remove both the mock airway phantom and the polymer slab and place in level oven at 80 °C for 2 h.\nRemove the phantom and slab from the oven and let cool for 20 min. Disassemble the polymer mold with a scalpel without cutting the cured polymer. Snap the base plate off of the mock-airway base.\nPlace phantom in a heated (60 °C) ~0.5 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) base bath until the internal part is fully dissolved. An optically clear reference phantom may help to determine the dissolving time for the internal component. Once internal structure is dissolved, take phantom out of the bath and let fully dry (~24 h) before taking any optical measurements.\n5. Verification of Phantom Fabrication\nVerify phantom geometry using high resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or micro-computed tomography (CT) imaging, if desired. These methods provide a 3D verification of internal structures within turbid material with axial resolutions of <400 µm39,40. Alternatively, an optically clear reference phantom can be optically imaged for verification that the printed part is fully dissolved and the remaining void is the correct geometry.",
    "NOTE: We have verified the internal geometry of an optically opaque phantom (2 mg TiO2 + 3.5 µl India ink) with micro-CT on a North Star Imaging (NSI) X50. The phantom was imaged with 20 µm resolution in all dimensions (Supplemental Materials 3, 4).\nVerify optical properties of the phantom using the polymer slab and the integrating sphere (described in steps 1.5–1.6).\nSubscription Required.
