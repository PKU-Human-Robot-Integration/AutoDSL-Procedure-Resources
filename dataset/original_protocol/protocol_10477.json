    "Caution: Please consult the safety data sheets (SDS) of all involved chemicals before use. The drug screening experiment involves the synthesis and handling of nanomaterials, which may have additional hazards compared to their bulk counterpart. Please ensure all necessary control measures to be practiced throughout the experiment, including the use of engineering controls (fume hood) and personal protective equipment (PPE, e.g., safety length pants, closed-toe shoes, chemical resistant gloves, and safety goggles).\n1. Preparation of Chemical Reagents for Drug Screening\nPrecursors for Au NCs synthesis\n\t\nDissolve 30 mg of gold (III) chloride solution (99.99% trace metals basis, 30 wt.% in dilute HCl) in 6.9 ml of ultrapure water to prepare 15 mM of gold (III) chloride solution. Caution: gold chloride solution is corrosive and irritant. Wear proper PPE to avoid direct contact with eye and skin.\nDissolve 74 mg of HSA or BSA in 1 ml of ultrapure water to prepare 74 mg/ml of protein stock solution.\nDrug solutions\n\t\nDissolve the desired amount of drug, e.g., 1.9 mg for (a) ibuprofen, 2.8 mg for (b) warfarin, 2.3 mg for (c) phenytoin, and 1.5 mg for (d) sulfanilamide in 20 µl of DMSO to prepare 450 mM of drug stock solutions.\n\t\tNote: DMSO is selected as the solvent because these drugs are hydrophobic and have poor solubility in water.\nOther reagents\n\t\nDissolve 600 mg of NaOH pellets in 10 ml of ultrapure water to prepare 1.5 M of NaOH solution. Dissolve 2.4 g of urea in 2 ml of ultrapure water to prepare 20 M of urea solution.\n2. Synthesis of Protein-Templated Au NCs\nHSA-templated Au NCs (HSA-Au NCs)\n\t\nPlace two glass vials, each containing a micro magnetic stir bar in it, on two separate temperature controllable magnetic stirrers.",
    "Set the temperature of one magnetic stirrer to 60 °C, and label the glass vial on top of it as “60 °C”; while the other magnetic stirrer is kept at room temperature (RT) where the glass vial on top of it is labeled as “RT”.\nAdd 200 µl of HSA solution, 200 µl of ultrapure water, and 200 µl of gold (III) chloride solution to each vial under constant stirring (set as 360 rpm unless otherwise specified) to allow the encapsulation of Au ions inside the protein template.\n2 min later, add 20 µl of NaOH solution to each vial so as to activate the reducing capability of HSA in forming Au NCs and start to record the reaction time as 0 min.\nEvery 20 min, draw 50 µl of solutions from each of the sample to a 384-well black plate and measure the emission spectrum with a microplate reader. The typical scanning setup: λex = 370 nm, λem = 410 – 850 nm.\nStop the magnetic stirrer after 100 min.\nCool down the glass vials under running water in a sink. Caution: The glass vials are hot. Wear heat resistant gloves to avoid burning.\nPlot the photoemission spectra at all time for each sample to acquire the formation kinetics of Au NCs at different temperature conditions.\nBSA-templated Au NCs (BSA-Au NCs)\n\t\nPlace a glass vial containing a micro magnetic stir bar on the top of a magnetic stirrer. Leave the temperature as room temperature.\nMix 200 µl of BSA solution, 200 µl of urea, and 200 µl of gold (III) chloride solution in the glass vial under constant stirring.",
    "2 min later, add 20 µl of NaOH solution to activate the reducing capability of BSA to form Au NCs and start to record the reaction time as 0 min. Measure the photoemission spectrum of the reaction mixture hourly.\n\t\tNote: The photoemission spectrum of BSA-Au NCs is measured less frequently because the formation rate of BSA-Au NCs is slower than that of HSA-Au at the same temperature due to less effectiveness of urea to unfold the protein.\nStop the magnetic stirrer after 7 hr. Plot the photoemission spectra at all time to see the formation kinetics of Au NCs by urea denaturation.\n3. Small Molecular Drug Screening\nScreen relative binding affinity of different small molecular drugs to HSA\n\t\nPlace five glass vials, each containing a magnetic stir bar in it, on top of a temperature controllable multipoint magnetic stirrer. Label these vials as a, b, c and d respectively for each drug, namely ibuprofen, warfarin, phenytoin, and sulfanilamide. Label the one with pure HSA as control.\nAdd 200 µl of HSA to each vial. Add 1 µl of drug solution to the four corresponding vials. Add 1 µl of DMSO to the control. Switch on the stirrer and set the spin speed to 360 rpm and incubate for 1 hr to allow the drug binding to HSA to complete.\n1 hr later, add 200 µl of Milli-Q water and 200 µl of gold (III) chloride solution to each vial under constant stirring. Set the temperature to 60 °C under constant stirring for 10 min. Add 20 µl of 1.5 M NaOH to each vial and start to record the reaction time as 0 min.",
    "Quickly draw 50 µl of solution from each vial to a 384-well black plate and measure the emission spectrum (results labeled as 0 min). Record the emission spectra of each sample every 10 min. Collect at least four spectra at four different time, that is 0, 10, 20, and 30 min.\nRepeat steps 3.1.1 - 3.1.4 several times to obtain results with a consistent trend. Stop the magnetic stirrer.\nPlot the time-resolved photoemission spectra for each sample (a - d, and control). Identify the peak intensity of all samples and plot against the time to compare the formation kinetics of Au NCs in different drug-loaded protein templates.\nMeasure the binding constant of a specific drug to HSA\n\t\nRepeat steps 3.1.1 – 3.1.4. Replace the drug solution with ibuprofen solutions at four different concentrations (including a control sample using HSA only without drug loading). Label the glass vial according to the drug concentration correspondingly.\n10 min later, cool down the glass vials under running water in a sink. Caution: The glass vials are hot. Wear heat resistant gloves to avoid burning.\nDraw 50 µl of the above solutions from each vial to a 384-well black plate and measure the emission spectrum.\nRepeat steps 3.2.1 – 3.2.3 twice more to obtain another two sets of results at different drug concentrations.\nStop the magnetic stirrer. Plot the photoemission spectra and analyze the results.\n\t\t\nFor the raw data obtained in each individual batch, plot the photoemission spectra of each sample in software such as OriginPro software and find out the peak intensity.\nCalculate and plot the relative fluorescence intensity [(I0 - I) /I0] against the drug concentration, where I and I0 refer to the fluorescence intensity of Au NCs formed in drug-loaded HSA and pure HSA, respectively.",
    "Calculate the binding constant by fitting the data to a single site binding model using the Michaelis-Menten equation: Y = Rmax × C/(KD + C), where Rmax indicates the maximum response signal, C is the concentration of ligand and KD is the binding constant. Perform this in software such as OriginPro. Select the menu Analysis Fitting Nonlinear Curve Fit, then select Hill function from Growth/Sigmoidal category. On the Settings: Function Selection page, click Fit to show up the fitted results.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
