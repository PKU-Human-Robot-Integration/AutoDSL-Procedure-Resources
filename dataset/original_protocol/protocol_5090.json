    "Selection of naïve CD4+ T cellsOn day 0, isolate spleens from donor CD90.1 mice. Use 1 spleen per 2 recipient Rag1-/- mice. Disaggregate spleens on a 100 µm nylon filter and rinse the filter with PBS/2% horse serum (HS) to obtain a single cell suspension. Spin down cell suspension at 370 x g for 5 min.Lyse the red blood cells by resuspending the cell pellet in 3 ml of ACK lysis buffer for 3 min. Wash cells with PBS/2%HS and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml of PBS/2% HS containing 5 mM EDTA. Note: The initial volume for cell resuspension is not critically important since the cells have to be counted and adjusted to 1 x 108 cells/ml, as indicated in the following step.Count the cell numbers using a hemocytometer and adjust the cell concentration to 1 x 108 cells/ml.Add 50 µl/ml of the provided rat serum (from EasySepTM Mouse Streptavidin RapidSpheresTM Isolation Kit) and incubate with biotinylated antibodies (anti-mouse B220 and CD8α). Mix the cells carefully by pipetting.Leave the tube containing the cell suspension on ice for 15 min. Note: Cells have to be mixed carefully by pipetting following addition of anti-mouse antibodies. The tube containing the cell resuspension can be left on ice without further mixing/inverting/shaking. Vortex the streptavidin RapidSpheresTM for 30 sec and add 85 µl/ml of RapidSpheresTM to the cell suspension. Note: No initial wash step of the RapidSpheresTM is required but vortexing the RapidSpheresTM is critical since they tend to settle at the bottom of the tube.Mix carefully by pipetting up and down and incubate at room temperature for 2.5 min.Bring the cell suspension to a total volume of 2.5 ml using PBS/2% HS containing 5 mM EDTA and transfer to a 5 ml PS tube.",
    "Place the 5 ml PS tube containing the cell suspension into the EasySepTM magnet for 2.5 min at room temperature. In one continuous motion, invert the magnet and carefully pour off the cell fraction (streptavidin RapidSpheresTM unbound fraction) into a new 5 ml tube, leaving the magnet and tube in an inverted position for 2-3 sec to ensure optimal transfer of the cell suspension. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170313/20170313081658_5315.jpgFigure 1. T cell enrichment method using splenocytes of donor mice Wash cells in PBS/2% HS at 370 x g for 5 min. Stain cells in 1 ml of anti-mouse CD45RB FITC, CD25 PE and CD4 APC-Cy7. Mix the cells carefully by pipetting. Leave the tube containing the cell suspension on ice for 20 min without further mixing/inverting/shaking.Wash cells (enriched for CD4+ T cells) with PBS/2% HS prior to cell sorting for CD4+CD45RBhi T cells on a BD FACSARIA III cell sorter. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170313/20170313081942_3814.jpgFigure 2. Gating strategy for the selection of naïve CD45RBhi T cells from spleens of donor C57BL/6 congenic mice. Lymphocytes are first selected based on their forward and side scatter properties, followed by the exclusion of doublet cells. Regulatory and activated T cells are excluded by selecting CD25 negative lymphocytes from the singlets gate and finally, naïve CD4+ T cells are selected based on their high expression of CD4 and CD45RB.Collect sorted cells in 1 ml of HS (100% HS). Wash sorted CD4+CD45RBhi T cells in PBS for 5 min at 370 x g and resuspend in PBS at a concentration of 1 x 106 cells/ml.Note: Keep the cells on ice at all times. If sorted naïve CD4+ T cells cannot be injected right away, keep the cells in HS on ice. Only wash and resuspend the cells with PBS prior to injection.",
    "To induce colitis, inject C57BL/6 Rag2-/- mice with 2 x 105 CD4+CD45RBhi T cells in a volume of 200 µl intraperitoneally (i.p). Once the animals are colitic (see Procedure B), inject the animals three times with 250-500 µg of anti-CD4 depleting antibody with an interval of 72 h between each injection to induce remission. Note: Remission induction was initially performed using 500 µg of αCD4 depleting antibody, as described by Brasseit et al., 2016. In our experiments, we can still achieve the same level of CD4+ T cell depletion and similar kinetics of remission induction using 3 treatments of 250 µg αCD4 depleting antibody.Monitor the animals daily for weight change and normal activity, with relapse of colonic inflammation expected around 22-25 days (in Helicobacter positive recipients) after the first treatment with anti-CD4 depleting antibody. Note: To assess the development of colitis, monitor the mice daily since the kinetics of colitis induction is strongly dependent on the composition of the microbiota implying that disease progression may vary from animals of one SPF mouse house facility to the other. In our experience, clinical and histopathological signs of colitis are seen around day 9-10 post T cell transfer in Helicobacter positive mice and around day 30 post T cell transfer in Helicobacter negative mice. In Helicobacter positive recipient mice, clear weight loss (approximately 10%) and appearance of colitogenic CD4+ T cells in the blood occurs very rapidly from one day to the other. Moreover, we generally observe that the weight loss correlates strongly with the extent of intestinal inflammation in Helicobacter positive but not in Helicobacter negative recipients. Clinical and histopathological scoringMice with active intestinal inflammation (clinical score ≥ 8) and with detectable CD4+ T cells in the blood are considered colitic.",
    "For the measurement of CD4+ T cells in the blood, collect 2-3 drops of blood by the tail vein in 1 ml of PBS/2% HS/5 mM EDTA. Spin down the cells by centrifugation at 370 x g for 5 min. Resuspend the cells in 100 µl of PBS/2% HS containing anti-mouse CD4 antibody (Refer to Materials and Reagents section for antibody dilution) by pipetting. Following incubation on ice for 15 min, wash the cells in PBS/2% HS and analyse on a flow cytometer. For clinical disease scoring, monitor the following parameters daily:Weight lossStool consistencyAppearance of blood in the stool Behaviorimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170313/20170313082538_8683.jpgFigure 3. Scoring system used to assess colitic animals following transfer of CD4+ CD45RBhi T cells in lymphopenic recipients. Mice with a clinical score of ≥ 8 were considered colitic (multiple combinations leading to a clinical score of 8 are possible).  For histological disease scoring, collect colon (middle) sections for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170313/20170313082635_7237.jpgFigure 4. Collection of colon tissue section for histologyIn a blinded manner, measure the following parameters (this should be done by an experienced pathologist). Refer to the publication by Brasseit et al., 2016 in Mucosal Immunology for more details:Cellular infiltrates in the lamina propria (Score from 0 to 3)Loss of goblet cells (Score from 0 to 3)Presence of crypt abscess (Score from 0 to 3)Epithelial erosion (Score from 0 to 1)Hyperemia (Score from 0 to 2)Thickness of the colonic mucosa (Score from 0 to 3)Paraffin embedding and H&E stainingNote: The paraffin embedding and H&E staining are routinely carried out in our histology core lab facility using a fully automated procedure on a Tissue-Tex VIP 6 but the basic steps are described below. Collect 1 cm colonic tissue (middle section) in a uni-cassette® and fix in 4% buffered formalin overnight at room temperature.",
    "Process the tissue as follows (using an automated tissue processor):4% buffered formalin for 1.25 h at 35 °C.Distilled water for 15 min at room temperature.70% ethanol for 1.5 h at 35 °C.80% ethanol for 1 h at 35 °C. 95% ethanol for 1.5 h at 35 °C.100% ethanol for 1 h at 35 °C (three changes of 1 h each).Xylene for 1 h at 35 °C (two changes of 1 h each).Paraffin for 45 min at 60 °C (four changes of 45 min each).Note: Changes of ethanol, xylene and paraffin are required to reduce carryover of reagents from previous steps.To embed in a paraffin block. Choose an appropriate mold that corresponds to the size of the cassette.Open the cassette and discard the lid.Add some liquid paraffin into the mold, which is placed on a heating block at 60 °C to prevent the paraffin from solidifying.Transfer the tissue into the mold using warm forceps such that the forceps can be used to transfer the tissue from the cassette to the mold without solidifying the paraffin. Place the mold on a cold plate (-10 °C) to start solidifying the paraffin and immediately press the tissue down with forceps.Place the tissue cassette on top of the mold and press firmly. Ensure that there is sufficient paraffin to cover the plastic cassette. Wait for the paraffin to solidify such that the paraffin block can easily come out of the mold. Cut 5 µm sections using a microtome. Briefly, insert the blade in the holder and adjust the angle of the blade to 5°. Place the paraffin block in the object clamp and adjust to the desired orientation. Cut a few sections (10 µm) to expose the tissue surface.",
    "Once the tissue is exposed and the tissue cuts are smooth, adjust the section thickness to 5 µm. Carefully pick up the 5 µm tissue sections with forceps and float them in a warm water bath at 37 °C. Collect the sections on a clean glass slide and dry on a heating plate at 40 °C for 20 min. To stain with hematoxylin and eosin, first deparaffinize the slides with xylene for 5 min. Rinse twice with xylene and rehydrate the slides by rinsing sequentially in:Absolute ethanol (two changes);95% ethanol70% ethanol Distilled waterNote: The exact volumes are not specified here since this will depend on the size of the glass-staining jar. We recommended that the slides have to be totally submerged in the specified reagent. Stain with Mayer’s hemalum solution for 7 min and rinse with tap water.Bleach with 0.5% HCl-ethanol for a few seconds (depending on the desired staining depth of the nucleus) and wash slide immediately with tap water followed by a bluing step in tap water for 10 min. Rinse with 70% ethanol. Counter stain using Eosin-Phloxine solution for 2-3 min. Rinse twice with 70% ethanol.Dehydrate the slides by rinsing sequentially in:70% ethanol95% ethanolAbsolute ethanol (two changes in total)Xylene (two changes in total)Note: The exact volumes are not specified here since this will depend on the size of the glass-staining jar. We recommended that the slides have to be totally submerged in the specified reagent.Mount with Eukitt®"
