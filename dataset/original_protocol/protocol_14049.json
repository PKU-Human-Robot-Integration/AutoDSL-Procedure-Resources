    "All procedures and research activities were performed with institutional review board approval (CHR #17-21909).\n1. Pre-operative Preparation\nInduce general anesthesia in the patient, and position the patient prone on the Jackson table with chest bolster and hip pads.\nPrep and drape the patient's back in the usual sterile fashion.\n2. Surgical Procedure\nMake a small stab incision using a #15-blade over the PSIS contralateral to the side of the planned TLIF.\nPlace a biopsy needle through the stab incision into the ilium to harvest bone marrow aspirate (Figure 1A). Drive the navigation reference frame into the PSIS in a trajectory that places the reference arc inferior and medial, thereby avoiding interference with the standard trajectory of an S1 pedicle screw (Figure 1B).\nCover the wound with a sterile drape with the reference arc exposed and perform an intraoperative CT scan.\nPlan pedicle screw trajectories using the navigation system (Figure 1C); they are generally 3.5 cm lateral to the midline through a one-inch incision on each side for single level fusion (1.5 inch for two levels, and 1.75 inch for three levels).\nUse a navigated drill guide and 2-3 mm bit and high-speed drill to cannulate the pedicles and utilize K-wires to mark these trajectories.\nPlace the cannulated pedicle screws with reduction towers over the k-wires on the side opposite the TLIF.\nDetermine the trajectory along the disc space using the first tubular dilator which is oriented using the navigation system (Figure 1D). Place additional dilators followed by the TLIF retractor, which is connected to a self-retaining arm mounted to the bed.\nConfirm the retractor positioning via navigation.\nPerform the laminotomy, flavectomy, and facetectomy in standard fashion under the microscope.",
    "Use a high-speed drill to perform the laminotomy and facetectomy; if just a laminotomy is desired, avoid drilling into the facet joint in order to preserve the structural integrity of the posterior column.\nEnsure that the lateral border of the laminotomy is the medial aspect of the facet joint, while the medial border of the laminotomy should be the medial edge of the lamina. Utilize a Woodson elevator to dissect the ligamentum flavum off the dura. Once this is achieved, use a 2 or 3 mm Kerrison rongeur to remove the ligamentum flavum.\nNOTE: Navigation allows for maximal safe decompression without violation of the pedicle (Figure 1D, E).\nIf contralateral decompression is needed, angle the retractor across the midline and remove the underside of the contralateral lamina, ligamentum flavum, and hypertrophic facet capsule using a 2 or 3 mm Kerrison rongeur.\nUse the navigation again to identify the trajectory along the disc space to facilitate a safe and thorough discectomy.\nPrepare the disc space with shavers and distractors.\nUpon completing the discectomy, use intermittent fluoroscopy to visualize the degree of distraction required during the interbody cage trial placement to ensure preservation of the endplates (Figure 2A).\nMix the allograft cellular bone matrix with the autologous bone marrow aspirate harvested at the beginning of the operation and carefully pack it into the disc space.\nInsert the interbody cage (polyetheretherketone [PEEK]), and confirm its position via lateral and anterio-posterior (AP) fluoroscopy (Figure 2B).\nOnce TLIF has been completed, place the remaining pedicle screws.\nCarefully drive a pre-bent rod through the screw heads below the dorsal lumbar fascia. Use periodic fluoroscopy to confirm adequate rod length.\nGently compress the rods to induce lordosis before securing them with locking set screws.\nObtain a final fluoroscopy prior to closure.",
    "Close the thoracodorsal fascia with an 0 polyglactin 910 suture, close the subcutaneous tissue with 3-0 polyglactin 910, and approximate the skin edges with skin closure strips. Apply a water tight dressing.\n3. Post-surgical Care\nAmbulate patients on postoperative day 1 with a soft lumbar brace, and obtain standing 36-inch X-rays prior to discharge (Figure 2C).\nProvide patients a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump with morphine or hydromorphone overnight and ambulate on postoperative day 1.\nTransition patients to oral pain medications on the first day and discharge on postoperative day 2-3 with follow-up in 6 weeks.\nSubscription Required.
