    "1. Fabrication and Assembly of the Static Bioreactor\nFabrication of the Reservoir\n\t\nPrepare 50 ml centrifuge tubes as a culture medium reservoir for the bioreactor.\nMake two ports by drilling two 5 mm diameters holes at 20 mm from the bottom and the top of the reservoir, respectively. Then insert two luer fittings in 5 mm length silicone tubes. Press-fit these luer fittings through the holes, and seal all the connections with medical grade silicone glue.\nInsert a 0.22 µm filter into the upper port of the reservoir (Figure 1A).\nInsert a luer septum into the lower port of the reservoir (Figure 1A).\nMandrel-cap Assembly\n\t\nDrill a 4.5 mm diameter hole at the center of the ventilated cap of the reservoir tube without damaging the filter membrane that covers the aerating holes.\nPrepare a stir bar (diameter = 4.5 mm, length = 100 mm) as a mandrel for the construct.\nPrepare two silicone conical stoppers (length = 10 mm, middle hole diameter = 4.5 mm).\nAssemble the mandrel and the cap (mandrel-cap complex) as described in Figure 1B.\n\t\t\nPress-fit the mandrel into the hole. Insert the 2 stoppers over the mandrel so that the cap is fitted between them. Adjust the position of the mandrel so that its useful length is 78 mm.\nApply a primer and then medical grade silicone glue to the surfaces that will be in contact before joining the cap and the silicone conical stoppers together. Remove the excess glue on the cap.\nLet it dry at room temperature for 1-3 days.\nFabrication of the Gauze-grips\n\t\nPrepare 3 silicone tubes (tube 1: inner diameter = 6.4 mm, length = 5 mm; tube 2: diameter = 6.4 mm, length = 10 mm, and tube 3: diameter = 3.1 mm, length = 12 mm).",
    "Assemble the gauze-grips as described in Figure 1C.\n\t\t\nCut tube 1 longitudinally, and open it over tube 2. Stick them together with the silicone glue.\nCut sterile surgical gauze to 5 cm x 7 cm sheet, and then roll tightly the gauze over the tube 3 along the longest side of the gauze. Insert the tube 1-tube 2 complex over the gauze.\nAdd silicone glue to stick together the gauze, the tube 1-tube 2 complex and the tube 3. Cut the gauze at a length of 8 mm.\nAssembly and Sterilization\n\t\nAssemble the mandrel-cap complex and the gauze-grips as described in Figure 2.\nCoat the mandrel with medical grade grease (Figure 2A). Place the gauze-grips over the mandrel (Figure 2B). Distance the grips at fixed value of 35 mm from each other.\nPrepare a tubular mold by removing the bottom part of a 10 ml syringe using a table saw (final length = 8 mm) (Figure 2B).\nInsert the mold over the gauze grips-equipped mandrel-cap assembly (housing-mold complex), snap-fitting the mold on the silicone stopper (Figure 2C).\nAutoclave the reservoir and the housing-mold complex.\n\t\tNote: Be careful to hold on the silicone stopper tightly when inserting the mold to avoid its detachment.\n2.

Mechanical Characterization of the Constructs in the Longitudinal and Circumferential Directions\nInstall the experimental set-up consisting of the micromechanical tester equipped with a 5 or 10 N load cell and a bath containing PBS at 37 °C to keep the samples at pseudo-physiological conditions (Figure 6).\nBalance the load cell and the extensometer.\n\tNote: Balancing is a function integrated into the micromechanical tester consisting in resetting the displayed extension value and the displayed load value while no sample is mounted onto the machine. This function allows defining the reference for both measurements.\nMounting the tubular constructs onto the mechanical apparatus: longitudinal direction.\n\tNote: Perform longitudinal fatigue tests directly on the entire tubular constructs. Use in-house-built gripping devices to connect the gauze grips of the constructs to the load cell and to the base of the PBS bath.\n\t\nMount the tubular construct onto the gripping devices (Figure 7B), following the harvesting procedure (section 2.4).\nWrap the gripping devices and the gauze grips together with Teflon tape to prevent any slipping of the gauze grips during the test. Mount the sample onto the micromechanical tester (Figure 7C).\nMounting the ring-shaped constructs onto the mechanical apparatus: circumferential direction.\n\t​Note: Perform circumferential fatigue tests on ring-shaped specimens sectioned from the tubular constructs.
