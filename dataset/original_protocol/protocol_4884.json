    "Day 1Synchronize worms with bleaching protocols: use C. elegans plates with many gravid hermaphrodites (Stiernagle, 2006). Wash the plates with sterile H2O.Collect the liquid in a sterile 15 ml Falcon tube. Add H2O to a total volume of 3.5 ml.Mix 0.5 ml 5 N NaOH with 1 ml bleach. Make this solution fresh just before use! Add to the centrifuge tube with the worms.Vortex the tube for a few seconds. Repeat vortexing every 2 min for a total of 10 min.Spin the tube in a centrifuge for 30 sec at 1,300 x g to pellet the released eggs.Aspirate to 0.1 ml.Add sterile H2O to 5 ml. Vortex for a few seconds.Repeat steps A6 and A7.Transfer the eggs in the remaining 0.1 ml of liquid to the edge of a clean NGM plate seeded with an E. coli OP50 lawn and incubate at 20 °C.Note: If you use C. elegans mutants that do not change their intrinsic nature under high temperature, you can incubate eggs at 25 °C as some mutants grow slower than WT.  Inoculate Bcc strains in 15 ml Falcon tubes containing 3 ml of LB and incubate the tubes at 37 °C for 24 h in shaking condition (220 rpm). Note: As controls, use E. coli OP50 in the place of Bcc strains. Day 2Normalize Bcc cultures at 1.7 OD/ml and seed 50 μl of the culture on 3.5 cm diameter plates containing 3 ml of NGM agar (slow killing assay, SKA) or PGS agar (fast killing assay, FKA). Incubate the plates O/N at 37 °C. Note: Incubation of Bcc strains at 37 °C should never exceed 16 h. Do not store Bcc seeded plates at 4 °C, as many of these pathogens are very sensitive to temperature and this can cause variation.",
    "Check the developmental stage of worms. After 24 h worms should be at larval stage L2 or L3 when grown at 20 °C. Day 3Wash synchronized worms at larval stage 4 (L4) off plates with M9 buffer and collect them in 15 ml Corning tubes.  Wash worms 2-3 times with M9 buffer to remove residual bacterial cells.  Spot 30-40 L4 worms on the plates seeded with Bcc strains (5 replicas).  Note: Before adding the worms, plates should be kept at room temperature to cool them down after the incubation at 37 °C.  Count worms at time 0. Incubate the plates at 20 °C and perform daily count of surviving worms up to day 5 (for FKA) and day 6 (for SKA). Note: A worm is considered dead when it no longer responds to gentle touch with a platinum wire.  At the end of the experiment, calculate the average percentage of surviving worms.  Evaluate Bcc pathogenicity. The virulence ranking (VR) ranges from 0 to 3 and it is based on the percentage of surviving worms after the period of observation. A Bcc strain is considered to be non-pathogenic (VR = 0) when the percentage of worms alive at the conclusion of the period of observation ranges from 100% to 80%; VR = 1 corresponds to a percentage of worms alive between 79% to 50%; VR = 2 corresponds to a percentage of worms alive between 49% to 6%; finally, the VR is considered 3 when the percentage of surviving worms was ≤ 5% (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161010/20161010202506_6584.jpgFigure 1.
