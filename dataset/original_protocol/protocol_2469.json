    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMeasurement of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro activity\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section describes a procedure to measure Mpro activity using the FRET assay, which has been widely used to analyze Mpro activity and screen Mpro inhibitors (Zhu et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). In this FRET assay, a quenched peptide containing the Mpro cleavage site is used as the FRET substrate. After cleavage by active Mpro, the cleaved fragment MCA-AVLQ is released, resulting in a high value of relative fluorescence unit (RFU) (Yan et al., 2022a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nPrepare 10 mL FP assay buffer containing 1 mM DTT.\nBefore addition of the FRET substrate and active Mpro, pre-warm the solution for 30 min at RT.\nNote: To get reliable results, the preparation of pre-warmed assay buffer is necessary.\nCritical: All regular steps are carried out at RT.\nAdd 10.6 μL sample containing active Mpro (1.6 mg/mL) into 2 mL FP assay buffer for a final concentration of 8.48 μg/mL (0.25 μM).\nGently mix by pipetting.\nDivide into 50 μL aliquots.\nAdd 50 μL aliquots into a black 96-well microplate.\nNote: Use a fresh Mpro solution and keep the solution on ice when not in use.\nDilute the FRET substrate solution (2 mM) by 50 μL aliquots to generate the analyte with FRET substrate concentrations at 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, or 35 μM, respectively.\nGently mix by pipetting to generate a homogenous solution.\nProtect from light.\nProceed to measure the RFU value immediately (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nPlace the microplate containing analyte in a microplate reader.\nAfter setting the gain value of 58, measure the RFU value from the top with the excitation wavelength of 320 nm and emission wavelength of 405 nm every second for 30 s at RT.\nExport the obtained data as RFU values versus time (seconds).",
    "Note: Except for RFU value, the intensity of fluorescence can be expressed in arbitrary units (AU) or simply abbreviated as FL, and this value is device-dependent.\nCritical: The prepared analyte must be protected from light.\nCalculation of the Michaelis constant of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro\nTiming: 30 min\nAs described above, the initial velocity (V) of Mpro enzyme reaction is calculated by a linear regression for the first 30 s. According to the initial velocity, the Michaelis constant (Km) value is determined using a Michaelis-Menten equation to assess Mpro activity in vitro. This equation can be inferred using GraphPad Prism 8.0.\nPlot RFU values versus time (seconds) using a scatter plot.\nSelect at least 30 continuous points covering the first 30 s in an initial reaction curve.\nPlot a straight line to infer a curve equation and R-squared value on chart (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nNote: For an expected result, the R-squared value should be more than 0.98.\nRecord a slope value as an initial velocity (V=ΔRFU/s) in the indicated FRET substrate concentration (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1], Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2102_6.csv\nPlot the initial velocity against the FRET substrate concentration to generate a Michaelis–Menten equation using GraphPad Prism 8.0 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nProgram option: Michaelis–Menten equation.\nExport the Km value.\nNote: The Km value is a measure of the kinetics of an enzyme reaction, and it is equivalent to the concentration of substrate at which the reaction takes place at one half its maximum rate.\nFP assay operation\nTiming: 1 h",
    "This section describes a step-by-step FP assay procedure for the discovery of Mpro inhibitors (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). In this FP assay, the change of mP value is dependent on the molecular weight of a fluorescent moiety provided that temperature and viscosity remain constant. Candidate compounds targeting Mpro can be easily identified by monitoring the change of mP value in a pilot screening using this FP assay.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2102-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Application of the FP screening assay for discovery of Mpro inhibitors\n(A) The 4-step procedure of the FP assay for rapid screening of Mpro inhibitors. Step 1: 29 μL Mpro solution (0.4 μM) was incubated with 1 μL sample of a natural product (1 mg/mL) for 30 min at RT in a black 96-well microplate. Step 2: 20 μL FP probe solution (60 nM) was added and incubated for 20 min at RT. Step 3: The enzyme reaction was quenched by adding 10 μL avidin solution (0.3 μM) followed by 5 min incubation. Step 4: The mP value was measured by a microplate reader for data analysis.\n(B) The microplate layout in a large-scale screening. The positive (GC-376, 1 μM, A12-C12), negative (DMSO, D12-F12), and background (FITC-AVLQ peptide, 20 nM, G12-H12) wells were designated in each plate. These schematic diagrams are adapted with permission (Yan et al., 2022b).\n(C) The illustration for the primary screening cycle of a natural product library using this FP assay. The red dotted line indicated a baseline that is equivalent to 50% inhibition, and 6 candidate compounds were identified in a pilot screening.\n(D) The inhibitory effect of anacardic acid (AA) on Mpro activity in the FP assay. The chemical structure and IC50 value of AA are shown. Data are represented as mean ± SD.",
    "Prepare 4 mL solution containing 0.4 μM Mpro as working buffer using an aliquot of the FP assay buffer.\nPre-warm the fresh FP assay buffer for 30 min at RT before use.\nDilute 34 μL aliquot of Mpro solution in 4 mL FP assay buffer to generate a final concentration of 0.4 μM.\nGently mix by pipetting.\nDispense 29 μL aliquots into a black 96-well microplate using a multichannel pipette (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nNote: Make sure that bubble formation is minimal in this operation.\nAdd 1 μL sample of a natural product (1 mg/mL) to the Mpro-containing mixture using a multichannel pipette. Use new pipette tips for each well.\nDesignate the positive (GC-376, 1 μM, A12-C12), negative (DMSO, D12-F120), and background (FITC-AVLQ peptide, 20 nM, G12-H12) wells in each plate (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nGently mix using a shaker.\nIncubate the assay mixture for 30 min at RT.\nPrepare 3 mL FP probe solution containing 60 nM FP probe using the remaining aliquot of the FP assay buffer before next step.\nNote: The working solution of FP probe must be freshly prepared before use due to the instability of a fluorogenic peptide in the solution. According to the real needs, properly prepare the working solutions prior to the next step. The final concentration of a natural product is about 30 μM in the primary screening, and keep the incubation time within 35 min.\nCritical: In this test, the wells containing GC-376 (1 μM), DMSO, and FITC-AVLQ peptide (20 nM) are used as positive, negative, and background controls, respectively. These wells should be properly arranged in each microplate as described in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B.\nIt should be noted that the actual working concentration of DMSO used in this assay is less than 5% to achieve a reliable screening for natural products (Yan et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).",
    "Add 20 μL sample of 60 nM FP probe to the mixture containing natural products using a multichannel pipette (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nGently mix using a shaker.\nProceeding for 20 min at RT.\nProtect from light.\nPrepare 1.5 mL solution containing 0.3 μM avidin using the remaining aliquot of the FP assay buffer before next step.\nNote: The final concentration of FP probe is 20 nM in HTS experiments. Make sure that an equal volume of FP probe solution is dispensed into the assay mixture to initiate an enzyme reaction. During this process, the microplate must be protected from light.\nAdd 10 μL sample of 0.3 μM avidin to the FP probe-containing mixture using a multichannel pipette (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nGently mix using a shaker.\nIncubate the reaction mixture for 5 min at RT to adequately quench this reaction.\nNote: The final concentration of avidin is 50 nM in HTS experiments.\nMeasure the mP value immediately (troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nLoad the microplate onto the tray of a microplate reader and initiate the FP program by clicking \"OK\".\nRecord the mP value from the top with the excitation wavelength at 485 nm and emission wavelength at 535 nm.\nExport the data for inhibition analysis of tested natural products (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nThe inhibitory activity of a tested compound is calculated using the Equation 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd1].\nThe candidate compounds (≥50% inhibition) are repeated in triplicate to confirm the inhibition against Mpro activity at the screening concentration.\nNote: The final volume in all wells is 60 μL in HTS experiments.\nCritical: Considering the instability of the FP probes and proteins, all used buffers must be freshly prepared before use. Importantly, these continuous steps must be completed as quickly as possible.",
    "For a rapid and reliable screening of natural products, each screening microplate should be arranged as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B, and the positive (GC-376), negative (DMSO), and background controls must be included in each screening cycle.\nThe evaluation of Mpro inhibition by anacardic acid\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section details a protocol for the inhibition evaluation of anacardic acid against Mpro activity using the FP assay. This procedure could be regarded as an inhibition test of candidate compounds targeting Mpro using the FP assay.
