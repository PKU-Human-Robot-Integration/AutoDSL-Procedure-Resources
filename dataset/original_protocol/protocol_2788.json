    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nBelow, we provide step-by-step instructions for how to use TANS. Example data from a highly-sampled individual subject (“ME01”, study author CJL) is used for demonstration purposes. The entire example dataset (n = 6, including ME01) can be obtained from Box (https://wcm.box.com/v/TANS-ExampleData[href=https://wcm.box.com/v/TANS-ExampleData]).\nDownload the Targeted Functional Network Stimulation (TANS) code.\nTiming: A few minutes\nThis section describes how to obtain the TANS code from GitHub and to set up the Matlab environment.\nInstall TANS by downloading the code from GitHub (https://github.com/cjl2007/Targeted-Functional-Network-Stimulation[href=https://github.com/cjl2007/Targeted-Functional-Network-Stimulation]) and adding the folder to the Matlab search path.\nOpen a Matlab terminal and add the TANS, SimNIBS, and CIFTI/GIFTI utility folders to the Matlab search path.\n% Define directories\nPaths{1} = '/SimNIBS-4.0/';\nPaths{2} = '/TANS/';\nPaths{3} = '/Utilities/';\n% Add the directories\naddpath(genpath(Paths{1}));\naddpath(genpath(Paths{2}));\naddpath(genpath(Paths{3}));\nCritical: Before proceeding, confirm that FSL, FreeSurfer, Connectome Workbench, and SimNIBS command line utilities are available when using system commands in Matlab.\nIf successful, each of the commands below should return status as 0.\n% Confirm various software is available\n[status,∼] = system('mris_convert -version'); % freesurfer\n[status,∼] = system('charm -version'); % simnibs v4.0\n[status,∼] = system('wb_command -version'); % connectome workbench\n[status,∼] = system('flirt -version'); % fsl\nIf successful, each of the commands below should return status as 2.\n    % Confirm that functions for reading and writing\n    % CIFTI and GIFTI files are also available\nstatus = exist('ft_read_cifti_mod','file');\nstatus = exist('gifti','file');\nNote: If status returns an unexpected value, this indicates that either the operating system environment variable or a path to a critical software package is incorrect or missing. This must be fixed before proceeding (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem #2).\nCreate the head model\nTiming: Typically 1–2 h\nThis section describes how to make the head model used later on for E-field modeling.",
    "Use the tans_headmodels function to create a head model for E-field modeling using the CHARM method.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] In addition, this function generates skin surface geometry files (∗.surf.gii) that can be used for visualizing certain results later on.\nThe inputs to the function are:\nSubject: The subject ID (string).\nT1w: Path to T1w-weighted anatomical image (string).\nT2w: Path to T2w-weighted anatomical image (string).\nOutDir : Path to the output folder (string).\nPaths: Paths to folders that must be added to Matlab search path (cell array of strings).\n% Define inputs\nSubject = 'ME01';\nT1w = ['/example_data/' Subject '/anat/T1w/T1w_acpc_dc_restore.nii.gz'];\nT2w = ['/example_data/' Subject '/anat/T1w/T2w_acpc_dc_restore.nii.gz'];\nOutDir = ['/example_data/' Subject '/tans'];\n% run the tans_headmodels function\ntans_headmodels(Subject,T1w,T2w,OutDir,Paths);\nNote: The T2-weighted image should be already co-registered to the T1-weighted anatomical image (“T1w”). If a T2-weighted image is not available, T2w can be set to [];\nNote: Visually examine the key outputs of the tans_headmodels function located in the [OutDir '/HeadModel/m2m_’ Subject ‘/’] folder to confirm tissue segmentations (final_tissues.nii.gz, skin.nii.gz) and skin surface geometry files (Skin.surf.gii) look correct. Manually edit tissue segmentations, if needed.\nIdentify the target network patch\nTiming: Typically less than 1 min\nFunctional networks usually consist of multiple nodes spanning different cortical zones in both hemispheres. This section describes how to identify which part of the network TMS can be targeted to maximize stimulation specificity.\nUse the tans_roi function to find the largest patch of the target network that is accessible to TMS (i.e., on a gyral crown) within a specified search space.\nThe inputs to the function are:\nTargetNetwork: A CIFTI file containing the functional network of interest (structure array). Non-zero values in TargetNetwork.data are considered target network vertices.\nMidthickSurfs: Paths to low (32k) dimensional FS_LR midthickness surfaces (Cell array of strings, MidthickSurfs{1} = path to LH, MidthickSurfs{2} = path to RH).",

Identifying the target network patch using the tans_roi function\n(A and B) Inputs for the function include the search space, sulcus map, and target functional network map (A). The search space is a binarized mask that constrains which elements of the target functional network are considered eligible targets for TMS. In this example, the search space is the lateral prefrontal cortex (green). The sulcus map (generated by Freesurfer) quantifies how far each vertex is from a hypothetical middle point between gyri and sulci (values > 0 indicate the vertex is closer to a gyrus and values < 0 indicate vertex is closer to a sulcus). The final output of the function is the largest patch of the target network after discarding all network vertices outside of the search space or in a sulcus (B).\nNote: All of these CIFTI files can be viewed on any of the fs_LR_32k surfaces (inflated and pial surfaces both shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).",
