    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIsolation of mouse oviduct epithelial cells and 2D cultures\nTiming: 1–2 h\nIn this section, we outline the steps required to isolate oviduct epithelial cells and seed 2D cultures using the whole oviducts from 5 mice (10 oviducts). Five mice are sufficient to set up approximately 10 wells of a 96-well plate. Single mouse cultures are also possible.\nDissection of oviducts:\nPrepare collagenase solution as outlined above. Place trypsin-EDTA (0.25%), PBS and 2D culture media in a 37°C water bath.\nEuthanize mice by CO2 administration and/or cervical dislocation.\nSpray the ventral surface of the mouse with 70% ethanol and make an incision down and then across the midline to expose the peritoneal cavity (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1431-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Dissection of mouse oviducts\n(A) Mouse oviducts are located by making a sagittal and transverse incision across the mouse’s abdomen to expose the peritoneal cavity.\n(B) The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is then moved cranially and the fat pads caudally to reveal the uteri.\n(C) The oviducts can be found adjacent to the ovaries by tracing the uteri laterally.\n(D) An isolated oviduct attached to a portion of the uterus and ovary.\n(E) A dissected and elongated oviduct after removal of ovary and connective tissue.\n(F) After removal of the uterus.\n(G) An example of segregation into distal and proximal regions with removal of the ampulla-isthmus junction (AIJ).\n(H) Oviducts after being pulled apart into 1 mm fragments for enzymatic digestion. Scale bars = 1 mm. FRT = female reproductive tract, INF = infundibulum, AMP = ampulla, AIJ = ampulla-isthmus junction, IS = isthmus, UTJ = uterotubal junction.\nMove the gastrointestinal tract cranially to reveal the uteri (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).",
    "Follow each uterus laterally to locate the ovary and oviduct. Keeping a portion of the uterus, cut out the ovary and oviduct and place it into an ice cold dissection solution (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nUnder a dissection microscope dissect the oviducts, removing ovary, uterus and connective tissue (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D–1F).\nNote: Keeping a portion of the uterus will help manipulation during dissection.\nNote: If segregating distal and proximal regions, separate infundibulum and ampulla from the isthmus and uterotubal junction, discarding the ampulla-isthmus junction (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).\nSingularization of epithelial cells:\nIn a 200 μL drop of collagenase solution pull apart the oviducts into 1 mm segments using forceps and transfer the segments and solution into a sterile 1.5 mL tube containing 200 μL collagenase solution (total solution = 400 μL) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H).\nIncubate in a 37°C water bath for 40 min, agitating every 5 min by flicking the tube.\nAlternatives: A heated 37°C shaker can also be used with agitation every 5–10 min by flicking the tube.\nCentrifuge oviducts/cell suspension at 240×g for 5 min on a tabletop microcentrifuge.\nResuspend in 500 μL of 37°C PBS to wash the tissue/cells and repeat centrifugation.\nResuspend in 500 μL Trypsin-EDTA (0.5%) and incubate in a 37°C water bath for 5 min.\nAdd 500 μL of 2D media and then pass the suspension 10 times through a 18G needle attached to a 1 mL syringe to dislodge and segregate epithelial cells.\nUsing a 200 μL tip, pass the cell suspension through a 40 μm cell strainer into a fresh sterile Eppendorf.\nCritical: Pre-wet tips, cell strainer and syringe with 2D media to prevent loss of cells.\nNote: If preparing oviduct cultures using early postnatal mice (before sexual maturity which occurs around 40 days after birth), skip steps 2c-e to avoid excessive stromal cell contamination.",
    "Critical: Be careful not to break apart the oviduct segments excessively when passing through the needle. The aim is to dislodge the epithelial cells without breaking the tissue too much, which can result in significant contamination of cultures with stroma cells. See problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nSeeding 2D cultures:\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 240×g for 5 min.\nResuspend in 200 μL of 2D media and perform a cell count using a hemocytometer.\nNote: We recommend counting cells using a hemocytometer, because cell counts using an automated cell counter may be inaccurate due to incomplete singularization of epithelial cells. On average we were able to obtain around 300,000–400,000 cells per 5 mice.\nSeed cells at a density of 20,000 cells per well in a 96-well flat bottomed tissue culture plate (Corning, Falcon® cat #353072) and fill wells with 200 μL of 2D media (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nCulture until 75% confluent, usually 2–5 days, in a humidified 37°C incubator supplied with 5% CO2 and change media every 2–3 days (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nCritical: It is important to seed 2D cultures at a minimum cell density of 20,000 cells per well to ensure successful proliferation. In addition, cells should be transferred to 3D cultures before reaching confluency to capture cells in a proliferating phase. (See problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1431-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. 2D seeding and isolation densities\n(A) Brightfield images showing 2D oviduct epithelial cultures after 24 h of culture. To ensure successful expansion of epithelial cells, cultures should be seeded at a density of 20,000 cells per 96-well plate.\n(B) Brightfield images showing 2D oviduct epithelial cultures after 3 days of culture. 2D cultures should be transferred to 3D once at 75% confluency, as indicated in the central panel. Scale bars = 100 μm.\nOrganoid cultures\nTiming: 1–2 h",
    "In this section, we outline the steps required to transfer primary 2D oviduct epithelial cultures to organoid cultures.\nSeeding organoid cultures:\nBefore beginning, place sterile 24-well tissue culture (Corning, Falcon® cat #353504) plates in a 37°C incubator, thaw Geltrex on ice, and prewarm sterile PBS, trypsin-EDTA (0.25%) and organoid media in a 37°C water bath.\nCritical: Tissue culture plates need to be placed in a 37°C incubator at least 1 h before seeding to ensure Geltrex domes are set in the middle of wells without touching the sides.\nRemove media from 2D cultures and wash wells with 200 μL of PBS.\nTo recover cells, add 50 μL of trypsin-EDTA (0.25%) and incubate at 37°C for 10 min, breaking apart cells by pipetting halfway through.\nAdd 50 μL of prewarmed 2D media and break apart cells by pipetting before collecting into a sterile Eppendorf, combining cells of the same type.\nCentrifuge the single cell suspension at 240×g for 5 min on a tabletop microcentrifuge followed by resuspension in 200 μL pre-warmed sterile PBS.\nCount cells using a hemocytometer or automated cell counter.\nAdd 200 μL of prewarmed sterile PBS to the cell suspension and centrifuge again to wash the cells.\nResuspend cells in ice-cold Geltrex at a cell density of 500 cells per μL.\nSeed cells into pre-warmed 24-well tissue culture plates by pipetting a maximum of 50 μL carefully into the center of wells. Carefully flip the plates upside down and place in a 37°C incubator for 30 min to allow the Geltrex to set.\nOnce set, add 500 μL of organoid media containing 10 μM Y-27632 and culture in a humidified 37°C incubator supplied with 5% CO2. Fill the remaining wells with 500 μL of sterile PBS to maintain humidity.",
    "Critical: Seeding cells at the correct cell density is essential to generate successful organoid cultures. Seeding densities that are too high or low can significantly impair organoid formation and growth (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). See problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1431-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. 3D seeding density\nBrightfield images showing oviduct epithelial cells seeded into Geltrex domes. The desired seeding density (500 cells per μL) is indicated in the central panel. If seeded at a lower density (left panel), organoids may fail to form and will have impaired growth. If seeded at a higher density (right panel), organoids will not have enough space to grow and will impede each other’s growth. Scale bar = 750 μm.\nCulturing and passaging organoid cultures:\nOnce established, organoid media should be replaced every 2–3 days, without the addition of 10 μM Y-27632. 10 μM Y-27632 should be added only at the time of seeding.\nOrganoids should become visible 2–3 days after culture and should be passaged every 7–14 days (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1431-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Incubate the plate on ice for 1 h, breaking apart the Geltrex dome halfway through by pipetting.",
    "After 1 h repeat mixing by pipetting (the Geltrex should now be completely dissolved) and transfer the organoid suspension to a prechilled 15 mL sterile tube and fill up to 10 mL with ice cold PBS, mixing by inversion to ensure the Geltrex has been completely dissolved. See problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nCentrifuge the organoids at 100×g for 3 min at 4°C.\nResuspend in 500 mL of prewarmed/37°C trypsin-EDTA (0.25%) and transfer to a sterile 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Incubate for 10 min at 37°C, breaking apart organoids at 5 and 10 min by pipetting.\nCentrifuge singularized cells at 240×g for 5 min on a tabletop microcentrifuge.\nResuspend in 200 μL of prewarmed sterile PBS and count cells using a hemocytometer or automated cell counter.\nAdd 200 μL of prewarmed sterile PBS to the cell suspension and centrifuge again to wash the cells.\nResuspend cells in ice cold Geltrex at a cell density of 500 cells per μL and seed as previously described.\nDifferentiation of oviduct organoids:\nOviduct epithelial organoids can be encouraged to undergo multiciliated cell differentiation by Notch inhibition (Ford et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Kessler et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Xie et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nTo induce differentiation, organoids are allowed to form for 5 days before addition of 1 μM selective y-secretase inhibitor (Y0-01027) and continued culturing for a further 5–7 days (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B and 4C).\nNote: Low level spontaneous differentiation into multiciliated cells is also seen after several days in culture.\nWhole-mount immunofluorescence and 3D confocal microscopy\nTiming: 3 days\nIn this section, we outline the procedure to characterize oviduct organoids by whole mount immunofluorescence staining and 3D confocal imaging. This protocol is an adaptation of a previously published general organoid staining protocol (Dekkers et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nFixation:",
    "To isolate organoids, first wash with PBS and add 1 mL of ice-cold PBS to each well. Incubate the plate on ice for 1 h, breaking apart the Geltrex dome halfway through by pipetting.\nAfter 1 h repeat mixing by pipetting, the Geltrex should now be completely dissolved.\nCoat a pre-chilled 15 mL sterile tube with 1% (wt/vol) ice cold PBS-BSA (Bovine Serum Albumin). Also coat pipette tips with the same solution by pipetting up and down 3 times before handling organoids.\nCritical: Until organoids are fully fixed (step i) coat tubes and tips with 1% (wt/vol) ice cold PBS-BSA before contact with organoids to prevent organoids from adhering to plastic surfaces.\nTransfer the organoid suspension to pre-chilled 15 mL sterile tubes on ice, combining organoids under the same conditions.\nCollect any remaining organoids in the wells with 1 mL 1% (wt/vol) ice cold PBS-BSA.\nFill up to 10 mL with ice cold PBS, mixing by inversion to ensure the Geltrex has been completely dissolved.\nCentrifuge organoids at 100 g for 3 min at 4°C.\nCritical: Organoids should form a pellet without any remaining Geltrex. Undissolved Geltrex can stick organoids together and impair immunofluorescence by preventing penetration of antibodies or producing high background staining (See problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nOrganoids are then resuspended in 1 mL ice cold 4% (wt/vol) PBS-PFA (Paraformaldehyde) and incubated on ice for 45 min to fix, mixing the organoids halfway through by pipetting.\nFill up to 10 mL with 0.1% (vol/vol) PBS-Tween20 and mix by inversion before centrifugation at 100×g for 5 min at 4°C.\nPause point: Organoids can be stored in 0.1% (vol/vol) PBS-Tween20 for several days before starting immunofluorescence staining.\nImmunofluorescence:",
    "Resuspend organoids in 4°C organoid wash buffer (OWB) (0.1% (v/v), 0.2% (wt/v) PBS-Triton-X-BSA) and segregate into required wells of a 24-well plate, containing at least 200 μL OWB per well before addition of organoids.\nLeave on ice for 15 min for blocking.\nAdd 200 μL of OWB to each well and to an empty well as a reference.\nWait for the organoids to settle to the bottom then remove 200 μL from each well using the empty well as a reference to ensure 200 μL if left in each well.\nAlternatives: Plates can be placed on a gentle horizontal shaker to bring organoids to the center, allowing for removal of liquids by pipette from the side.\nAdd 200 μL of OWB containing a 2× dilution of the primary antibodies resulting in 400 μL of a 1× antibody solution per well and incubate for between 16 to 20 h at 4°C on a horizontal shaker.\nOn the next day, add 1 mL of OWB to each well and wait 2 min for the organoids to sink to the bottom.\nRemove 1 mL of OWB and replace it with a fresh 1 mL of OWB.\nLeave on a gentle shaker for 2 h at 21°C.\nRepeat steps 8g and h 2 more times.\nWait 2 min for organoids to sink to the bottom then remove 1 mL of OWB from each well.\nAdd 200 μL of OWB containing a 2× dilution of the secondary antibodies resulting in 400 μL of a 1× antibody solution per well and incubate for between 16 to 20 h at 4°C on a horizontal shaker.\nOn the next day, add 1 mL of OWB to each well and wait 2 min for the organoids to sink to the bottom.",
    "Remove 1 mL of OWB and replace it with a fresh 1 mL of OWB.\nLeave on a gentle shaker for 2 h at 21°C.\nRepeat steps 8m and n 2 more times.\nWait 2 min for organoids to sink to the bottom then remove 1 mL of OWB from each well.\nAdd 200 μL OWB containing a 2× dilution of DAPI and incubate for 10 min.\nAdd 1 mL of OWB to each well and wait 2 min for the organoids to sink to the bottom.\nRemove 1 mL of OWB and replace it with 1 mL of PBS.\nMounting:\nStick a 0.12 mm deep spacer (e.g., Secure-SealTM 8 well, 9 mm) onto a coverslip.\nPipette organoids into the well created by the spacer and remove as much left-over fluid as possible.\nAdd a drop of organoid mounting media to each well containing organoids and seal by sticking another coverslip on top.\nCritical: Addition of the mounting media and second coverslip can dislodge the organoids. Removing as much of the left-over fluid during the transfer and allowing the organoids to dry a little in place can help them stick to the coverslip.\nMounted organoids sandwiched between two coverslips should be stored at 4°C in the dark and imaged as soon as possible (see problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nViral transduction",
    "In this section, we outline steps to perform viral transduction of oviduct organoids in situ and during 2D expansion. Transduction during 2D expansion allows for the generation of clonal organoids within a mixed culture of transduced and non-transduced cells. This can be particularly useful when assaying for effects of gene function on organoid size, which we have shown to be dependent on organoid density (Ford et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). Separation of transduced cells is also possible using viral constructs containing fluorescent reporters and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). In situ transduction on the other hand allows for the manipulation of single cells within a fully formed organoid, which can be a good model of cancer initiation. As an example of 2D and in situ transduction we detail protocols using a Cre-expressing adenovirus (Ad-Cre-GFP (a kind gift from Dr. Luke McCaffrey, McGill University)) with an inducible fluorescent reporter mouse line, Tdtomatoflox/flox (Madisen et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nViral transduction during 2D expansion:\nIsolate oviduct epithelial cells from Tdtomatoflox/flox mice and seed in 2D cultures as outlined in steps 1–3.\nCulture cells until 40%–50% confluency, usually around 2 days.\nDilute Cre-expressing adenovirus to a final working concentration of 1.2 × 106 pfu/mL in pre-warmed 2D media.\nNote: The concentration of virus will depend on the desired outcomes of the experiment and the virus used. This should be optimized for each experiment. The concentration in this example produces robust transduction and can be used as a guide (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nRemove media from 2D cultures and replace it with 200 μL of 2D media containing the adenovirus.\nCulture for between 16 to 20 h in a humidified 37°C incubator supplied with 5% CO2.\nOn the next day either replace 2D media and continue culturing to 75% confluency or transfer directly to 3D cultures as outlined in step 4.",
    "Successful transduction can be confirmed by the expression of Tdtomato after 3–5 days (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B) (see problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).\nAlternatives: To reduce the amount of virus particles needed for an experiment it is possible to use 50 μL of virus containing media for each well, culture for 4 h and then top up to 200 μL before culturing for between 16 to 20 h.\nViral transduction in situ:\nOviduct epithelial organoids are generated from Tdtomatoflox/flox mice as outlined in steps 1–4.\nOrganoids are allowed to form for 3–5 days before transduction.\nDilute Cre-expressing adenovirus to a final working concentration of 1.2 × 106 pfu/mL in prewarmed organoid media.\nRemove media from organoid cultures and replace it with organoid media containing the adenovirus.\nCulture for between 16 to 20 h in a humidified 37°C incubator supplied with 5% CO2.\nReplace media with fresh organoid media.\nSuccessful transduction can be confirmed by the expression of Tdtomato after 3–5 days (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1431-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.
