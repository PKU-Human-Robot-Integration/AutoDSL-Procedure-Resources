Alternate: Instead of placing a drop of virus on the lip, the bifurcated needle can be dipped in the virus stock (see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]) and then the virus held by the needle is gently poked into the labial mucosa.\nNote: The bifurcated needle was designed for human inoculation with the live-virus smallpox vaccine. The needle is dipped into the reconstituted vaccine (containing infectious VACV). One dose of the vaccine is then held in a thin layer between the needle’s prongs (see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]). The needle is then used to poke the skin of vaccinees 15 times.\nNote: While we have inoculated mice using a dipped needle, we most commonly inoculate mice by placing a small drop of virus in the lip and gently poking 5–10 pokes through the drop of virus with a bifurcated needle (see (Shannon et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) for viral titers over time with this inoculum of virus). Viral titers can be increased or decreased with more or fewer pokes. More pokes will result in more morbidity and mice should be carefully monitored (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1037-Fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2. Increasing the number of pokes increases viral inoculum and titers in the labial mucosa\n(A) Viral titers in the labial mucosa on day 5 post infection of C57Bl/6 mice. Mice were infected with a starting viral titer of ~2e8 PFU/mL with a 10 ul droplet inside the lip. The number of pokes with a bifurcated needle is indicated. Dots represent different animals. Error bars = SEM.\n(B) Weight loss of mice inoculated in (A). Dots show means. Error bars = SEM.\n(C) Average weight loss/day of mice inoculated in (A). Dots represent different animals. Error bars = SEM.\nWipe the inner lip with sterile gauze to remove any remaining VACV.\nMonitor mice until they recover fully from anesthesia.\nNote: Thus far we have tested the lip (labial mucosa), tongue and cheek (buccal mucosa) for permissible infection. We have also successfully infected the murine labial mucosa with herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 strain SC16.\nNote: Although we have not found dramatic differences in the protocols between strains, we cannot rule out strain- or sex-specific differences, particularly in anesthesia requirements. Mouse age and weight do impact infection and viral titers (with young mice having higher viral titers), so this should be taken into consideration.\nCritical: Two steps are critical when infecting the labial mucosa: 1) ensure that viral inoculum is not inhaled by the mouse during the initial infection (See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) and 2) poke the mucosa only gently to prevent skin infection or excess bleeding. We have found that diluting the initial viral stock to 104 PFU/mL allows labial mucosal infection without lung infection due to inhalation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1037-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Inoculation using stock virus with high viral titer can result in infection outside the lip and increased morbidity",

Error bars = SEM.\nTissue collection and enzymatic digestion of labial mucosal tissue\nTiming: 2–4 h\nPrepare collection tubes.\nAppropriately label a screw cap 2 mL conical-bottom Sarstedt tube for each sample.\nThaw a 1 mL collagenase P aliquot in a 37°C water bath and add to 9 mL of RPMI medium (See materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section).\nPipette 1 mL of diluted collagenase P (final concentration of 1 mg/mL) to each 2 mL tube.\nNote: The working concentration of collagenase P is 1 mg/mL. We recommend preparing a stock solution at 10 mg/mL in RPMI without FBS and aliquoting to avoid freeze/thaw cycles. Stock aliquots are stored at −20°C.\nHarvesting labial mucosa.",
    "At the desired day post infection, euthanize mice and remove the lower lip using dissection scissors and forceps and place in a 2 mL tube with diluted collagenase P.\nGenerate a single-cell suspension of labial mucosa.\nFinely chop dissected lips with scissors in diluted collagenase P.\nPlace in 37°C water bath for 45 min.\nVigorously pipette up and down with a 1000 μL pipette until sample appears fully digested and homogenous.\nNote: It is essential to slowly pipette up and down to minimize the risk of the sample sticking to the inside of the pipette. We generally set the pipette to ∼ 750 ul, and in our hands we have found minimal sample loss. Depending on experimental question proceed to either “Analyzing oral mucosa tissue by flow cytometry” step or “Determining VACV titers in the oral mucosa” following sample digestion.\nEnzymatic tissue digestion to process labial mucosal tissue\nTiming: 4–6 h\nCritical: After sample collection, tissue processing should begin immediately in order to avoid compromising flow results. Collected samples should be kept on ice until processing. The ideal digestion parameters should be established for each experiment. In a study of lymphocyte recovery in the oral mucosa comparing dispase, collagenase I, collagenase II, collagenase III, and collagenase P, we found the greatest recovery of lymphocytes with collagenase P digestion, however some cell surface markers (such as CD4) can be cleaved by collagenase P. In order to analyze CD4+ cells, we recommend labial mucosal digestion with collagenase I (10000 units/mL) for 45 mins at 37°C.\nFilter digested sample through a 70 μm cell strainer into a 5 mL tube.\nRinse filter with 3 additional mL of RPMI medium and centrifuge cells at 870 × g at 4°C for 5 min.",
    "Discard the supernatant and resuspend cells in 250 μL of RPMI medium and filter through a 60 μm 96-well filter plate. (Alternatively, any 70 μm cell strainer can be used).\nTransfer filtered samples to a labeled 96-well round-bottom plate and centrifuge cells at 870 × g at 4°C for 2 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend cells in 250 μL of RPMI medium.\nCount cells and determine viability using Trypan Blue exclusion.\nNote: Typically, the number of cells obtained from the oral mucosa of a single mouse is only enough to stain a single well for flow cytometry (with counts falling between 8 × 105–2 × 106 cells/lip). Thus, the cells do not need to be counted and diluted into different wells as one might do for a larger organ, like the murine spleen.\nCentrifuge cells at ∼ 870 × g at 4°C for 2 min.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend in diluted antibody solution.\nExtracellular staining of samples.\nPrepare antibody dilutions in HBSS + 0.1% BSA or other buffer compatible with flow cytometry (See materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section) and resuspend each sample in 50 μL volume. A fixable viability dye can also be included at this point.\nNote: The dilution of each antibody depends on fluorophore and company. We have successfully stained using the antibodies mentioned in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table], however we recommend performing antibody titrations prior to starting. Depending on the goal of the experiment, a FcR block can be added prior to extracellular staining.\nProtect samples from light and incubate for 30 min on ice.\nAdd 200 μL of cold PBS to each well and centrifuge ∼ 870 × g at 4°C for 2 min.\nFixation of samples.\nPrepare 3.2% PFA from a 16% PFA stock by diluting 1:5 with PBS.",
    "Note: Samples are fixed in PFA to kill any infectious virus present in the sample before running through the cytometer. Diluted PFA should be made fresh just prior to fixation step. We recommend preparing PFA during the antibody staining incubation period. PFA is light sensitive. Any excess PFA should be disposed of according to institutional safety office guidance.\nDiscard supernatant and add 100 μL/ sample of 3.2% PFA and pipette each sample to ensure resuspension.\nProtect samples from light and incubate for 15 min at RT.\nPause point: Fixed samples can be stored at 4°C protected from light for at least 24 h. For longer storage, the effect on fluorescence should be empirically determined. We have not tested freezing cells for later analysis.\nPreparing samples for flow cytometric analysis.\nCentrifuge samples from step 15c at ∼ 870 × g at 4°C for 2 min.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend in 250 μL of HBSS + 0.1% BSA + 0.1% EDTA.\nAnalyze via flow cytometry.\nNote: This flow cytometry protocol has been used successfully to stain for a variety of extracellular markers including but not limited to CD45, CD8, CD4, CD49a, CD49b, CD103, CD69, and NK1.1. Gating for different cell populations will depend on the experiment and the desired cell populations. It can also be used for standard intracellular cytokine/protein staining as described for the transcription factor Eomes in (Shannon et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nDetermining VACV titer in the labial mucosa\nTiming: 3 days\nNote: Digested samples from step 5c can be stored at −80°C.\nCritical: When tittering animal tissues, an antibiotic must be added to the dilution tubes. We generally use 1 mL of gentamicin solution (at 50 mg/mL) in 500 mL of infection medium.\nPlate 7.5 × 105 143B cells/well into 6-well plates. Incubate cells overnight at 37°C with 9% CO2.",
    "Freeze-thaw digested samples three times.\nSerially dilute samples ten-fold.\nPrepare 6 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and label as 10−1, 10−2, 10−3, 10−4, 10−5, 10−6.\nAdd 1080 μL infection medium to each tube.\nAdd 120 μL of digested sample from 1 mL vial to 10−1 tube and mix well by pipetting.\nTransfer 120 μL of 10−1 to 10−2 and mix well by pipetting.\nIn the same manner, continue to dilute 1:10 from 10−2 to 10−6.\nFollow steps 29 – 34 of viral titration above (see “virus titration by plaque assay[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3]” section ).\nVisualizing the labial mucosal immune response using intravital microscopy\nTiming: 1–8 h\nPrepare mouse for intravital microcopy.\nCollect mouse from vivarium at desired time post-infection.\nPlace animal in induction chamber and induce anesthesia using 2% isoflurane. Alternatively, an injectable anesthetic can be used for initial anesthesia (we use avertin).\nSterilize the outer lip by alternating scrubs of Betadine and 70% ethanol, taking care not to disturb the labial mucosa.\nMake two small incisions (approximately 2 mm) at the angles of the mouth using dissecting scissors. Limit the size of the incisions to prevent bleeding.\nUsing tweezers, very gently pull the lip through a mini-stage and attach using either Vetbond or cyanoacrylate adhesive. Manipulate the lip gently to avoid bruising this tissue. The lip should be placed as flatly as possible or the mucosa will be out of focus.\nNote: Different mini-stages can be used to stabilize the lip. We have a pre-made stainless steel mini-stage; however, a thin, double-sided razor blade trimmed of its sharp edges can also be used.\nPlace a water-based lubricating gel on the inner lip and turn mouse so that the lip makes stable, firm contact with a glass cover slip. Any air bubbles will prevent imaging.",
    "Tape both sides of the mini-stage firmly to the microscope stage to prevent movement and ensure contact with the coverslip.\nGently attach a nosecone to the mouse with surgical tape so as not to disturb the lip/mini-stage. Secure nosecone and tubing to microscope stage using surgical tape. Maintain anesthesia at a concentration of 1.75% or as otherwise determined.\nNote: Illustrations of the mini-stage and mouse preparation can be found here ((Shannon et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2])).\nImage the labial mucosal immune response using intravital microscopy.\nPlace the prepared mouse on the microscope in the heated environmental chamber. We typically use a Leica DMi8 inverted five-channel confocal microscope equipped with an environmental chamber and dual multiphoton lasers: a MaiTai and an InSight DeepSee. We use ultrasensitive hybrid detectors and a 25 X water-immersion objective.\nMaintain continuous, steady heat throughout the experiment (using a heated environmental chamber).\nThe signal generated using second harmonic generation of collagen can be used to determine the lamina propria versus the mucosal epithelium.\nMice may be imaged for multiple hours using this setup. Ensure an appropriate amount of water-based lubricant is applied such that the lip does not dry.\nNote: One advantage of using VACV as a model of acute viral infection is the availability of numerous recombinant and deletion viruses. We visualize VACV-infected cells using fluorescent-reporter viruses (Hickman et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Various reporter mice can be used to image the immune response. We have encountered good success imaging both GFP and ZsGreen expression in the oral mucosa. To visualize blood vessels in the lamina propria, fluorescently labeled CD31 antibody can be injected intravenously prior to surgical preparation."
