    "**Tension sensor module expression and purification:**\n1. Seed HEK 293 cells onto six 10 cm dishes and incubate them in a cell culture incubator until cells are 90-95% confluent.\n  2. Prior to CaPO<sub>4</sub> transfection, replace the medium with 7 ml growth medium supplemented with 4 µl of 50 mM chloroquine per 10 cm dish.\n  3. Dilute 40 µg of tension sensor DNA with ultrapure H<sub>2</sub>O to a volume of 439 µl  and add 61 µl of 2 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>; vortex.\n  4. While vortexing, add 500 µl of 2 x HBS buffer to the DNA/CaCl<sub>2</sub> solution. \n  5. Add the transfection cocktail to the cells and incubate in the cell culture incubator for 6 h.\n  6. Replace the transfection medium with regular growth medium and incubate cells in the cell culture incubator overnight \\(O/N).\n  7. Replace medium and allow expression of the tension sensor constructs for another 48 h.\n  8. Suck off medium and wash cells once with PBS. Collect all cells in PBS, centrifuge at 300 g for 5 min and resuspend the cell pellet in 2 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer; incubate for 20 min on ice.\n  9. Mechanically homogenize cells with a Dounce homogenizer, then centrifuge at >13.000 g for 10 min at 4°C. Filter the supernatant \\(filter pore size 0.22 μm) and further purify with His-TRAP column according to the instructions of the manufacturer. \n  10. After purification, exchange the His-Trap elution buffer for PBS containing 5 mM TCEP using a PD-10 desalting column; incubate for 30 min on ice.\n  11. Perform a second purification using size exclusion chromatography in PBS containing 0.2 mM TCEP.\n  12. Store purified protein at -80°C.\n  \n**Preparation of bead-DNA-protein-DNA-bead dumbbell configuration for single-molecule calibration:**\n_Creating protein-DNA chimeras:_\n1. Dissolve lyophilized Moligos in PBS \\(pH 6.7) to a final concentration of 100 µM.",
    "2. Gently thaw the purified protein solution on ice.\n  3. Mix dissolved Moligos with the tension sensor protein solution; use a molar ratio of 2:1 as two Moligos are needed for one protein.\n  4. Let the solution react O/N at 4°C.\n  5. To remove unreacted Moligos, load the reaction mix onto a Ni-NTA column.\n  6. Use standard washing steps for His-Tag purification; then wash with 2 M KCl dissolved in PBS \\(pH 7.4).\n  7. To remove unreacted protein, install the Ni-NTA column before the size exclusion column and connect to the HPLC system.\n  8. Inject 500 mM imidazole buffer \\(dissolved in PBS \\(pH 7.4) to elute the sample from the Ni-NTA column.\n  9. Perform size exclusion chromatography using the HPLC system in PBS \\(pH 7.4); recommended flow-rate: 0.5 mL/min.\n  10. Collect the protein-oligo chimeras and prepare 5-10 µL aliquots, freeze and keep at -80°C until calibration measurement.\n  \n_Preparing DNA-handles by PCR:_\n11. Prepare the reaction mix according to the manufacturer's instruction for a 100 µL PCR reaction using the Taq DNA Polymerase with ThermoPol Buffer. Use a primer ratio for sense 1, sense 2 and anti-sense of 1:1:2. Split into 2 equally sized reactions and pipette into PCR tubes.\n  12. Perform standard PCR using a thermocycler \\(annealing temperature: 55°C, 44 cycles).\n  13. Purify the PCR-product using the QiaQuick PCR Purification Kit. Elute in 30-50 µL using the provided EB Buffer. Typically,  concentrations of 300 ng/µL are achieved.\n  \n_Final sample preparation:_\n14. To build the sample chamber, clean cover slips with Kimwipes and use the blower bulb to remove remaining particles.\n  15. Place two stripes of Parafilm M on a big cover slip forming a channel parallel to the longer axis.",
    "16. Mount on a heat plate \\(set to 85°C) and place a small cover slip on top of the channel; slightly press down.\n  17. Remove the ready-to-use sample chamber from the heat plate.\n  18. To passivate the glass surfaces, incubate the sample chamber channel with ~40 µL of BSA solution about 10 min prior to adding the final measurement mix \\(see below).\n  19. To assemble the final measurement mix, combine the protein-oligo construct with DNA-handles in PBS \\(pH 7.4), incubate for 2 h at RT. \n  20. Add streptavidin-coated silica beads and incubate for another 7 min at RT. \n  21. Assemble the final mix by combining anti-digoxigenin-coated silica beads with the assembled protein-oligo-DNA handles attached to streptavidin-coated silica beads. Prepare in PBS \\(pH 7.4) containing GODCAT \\(3 times 2 µL of 50 x solutions); adjust to a final volume of 100 µl and mix well.\n  22. Rinse the channel of sample chamber  with 100-200 µl PBS \\(pH 7.4) to remove the BSA.\n  23. Fill the channel with the final reaction mix and seal with vacuum grease.\n  \n**Single-molecule measurement:**\n1. Catch a fluorescent \\(i.e. anti-digoxigenin-coated) and a non-fluorescent \\(i.e. streptavidin-coated and protein-DNA chimera-attached) bead in each of the two traps.\n  2. Approach the two beads at a constant velocity by moving the mobile trap until the beads slightly touch each other.\n  3. Separate the beads at constant velocity and check whether a dumbbell like configuration has been established. If so, continue with constant velocity measurements \\(i.e. repetitive stretch- and relax-cycles) and  constant distance measurements. If not, repeat. After a couple of unsuccessful tries, grab another pair of beads.\n  \n**FRET evaluation by fluorescence lifetime microscopy \\(FLIM):**",
    "1. Seed cells expressing physiological levels of the molecular tension sensor \\(and cells expressing the respective control constructs, such as zero-force control and donor-only control) on fibronectin \\(FN)-coated glass cover slips and allow cells to adhere and spread.\n  2. In the meantime, start the SP5 microscope and the pulsed white-light laser \\(Frequency 80 MHz), install the 63 x water objective, and adjust the microscope setting to a scanning rate of 400 Hz, an image resolution of 512 x 512 pixels and a digital zoom factor of 2. \n  3. Replace the medium and unattached cells by fresh imaging medium and install the dish on the microscope stage.\n  4. Select cells using the microscope's eyepiece; enable FLIM detection in the Leica Software and acquire a series of images using the Imspector Software. To ensure sufficient photon counts, an image series of at least 10-20 images is recommended. Collect 20-30 cells per construct.\n  5. Export images in .tif format.\n  6. For post image-acquisition processing, create a region of interest \\(ROI) to isolate focal adhesion signals from background \\(e.g. by multi-otsu thresholding).\n  7. Determine the fluorescence lifetime by fitting a mono-exponential decay curve to the histogram of photon arrival times. The mono-exponential decay can be fitted by a Levenberg-Marquardt-based nonlinear least square fit.\n  8. Use the fluorescence lifetime \\(τ) determined from cells expressing only the donor fluorophore \\(D) and from cells expressing the FRET constructs \\(DA) to calculate a mean cell FRET efficiency E according to: E=1-\\(τ<sub>DA</sub>/τ<sub>D</sub>).\n  \n**FRET evaluation by ratiometric FRET imaging:**\n1. Seed cells expressing physiological levels of the molecular tension sensor \\(and cells expressing the zero-force control) on FN-coated glass cover slips and allow cells to adhere and spread.",
    "2. In the meantime, start the SP8 microscope and lasers, install the 63 x water objective, and adjust the microscope setting to a scanning rate of 100 Hz, an image resolution of 1024 x 1024, a pinhole of 88.64 µm and 2 x digital zoom. \n  3. Replace the medium and unattached cells with fresh imaging medium and install the dish on the Leica SP8 microscope stage.\n  4. Select cells using the microscope's eyepiece, then excite the donor fluorophore with the appropriate wavelengths \\(514 nm for YPet) and simultaneously record an image in the donor \\(522-550 nm) and the acceptor \\(600-700 nm) emission channel.\n  5. Export images in .lif format.\n  6. Create an ROI and substract the cytosolic background signal from the donor image by convolving the data \\(Gaussian structure element; width: 25, height: 2) and top-hat filtering \\(disk SE; radius: 7 pixel \\(pixel size 124 nm). Next,  create a binary image to obtain masks of individual FAs and apply these masks  to donor and acceptor image. \n  7. Calculate the FRET ratio for individual FAs by dividing the mean intensity of the acceptor FA mask by the mean intensity of the donor FA mask. Note, that oversaturated pixels should be suspended from analysis and mean donor intensities between biosensor and control cells should be comparable."
