    "1. Media Preparation\nPrepare grape agar according to manufacturer instructions (see Table of Materials) and pour into a 35 mm Petri dish to half-full (Figure 5).  Allow to solidify for approximately 1 h. After the grape agar solidifies, immediately use or store at 4 °C.\nGently make scratches across the agar plate using a small plastic knife (flies like to lay on uneven surfaces) leaving the middle of the plate without scratches (Figure 5). Place a small amount of yeast paste (made fresh; see Table of Materials) at the center of plate (Figure 5).\n2. Embryo Collection Mini Cage Set Up\nSet up a cross using two virgin females and one young male inside the embryo collection cage containing the grape agar plate supplemented with yeast paste (Figure 5).\nAfter 24 h, inspect the cages for laid embryos without opening the cage by looking at the bottom of the agar plate.  If embryos have been laid, remove the agar plate from the chamber and place it inside a humid chamber for microscopic observation (Figure 6).  If several days of laying are scored (e.g., fertility/longevity assays), keep the breeding parents and replace the plate with a fresh one prepared as described. Early collections of less than 24 h can be done but, when using virgin females, be aware that they will not lay until 48 h after emerging from their pupa case.\nCover the agar plate containing embryos with the Petri dish lid to avoid dehydration and place it immediately inside a humid chamber (Figure 7). Observe under a dissecting microscope and record hatched embryos and L1.  Replace lid and store at room temperature in humid chamber until all embryos had hatched and developed into L1 larvae (Figure 6).\n3. Counting Embryos and Larvae",
    "After 48 h, observe the plates under the dissecting microscope and record the numbers one last time before transfer of agar disc to food vial.  Fertilized/viable embryos should become L1 by then.  Longer incubation periods prior to transfer are possible but be aware that plates may start losing moisture and the agar may crack compromising a clean transfer to food vials (Figure 7).  To ensure the plates remain hydrated and embryo viability is not compromised while counting, avoid using a direct gooseneck light over the agar surface (Figure 7E shows an appropriate distance).\nAfter counting, cover the plate and store it in the humid chamber until ready to transfer. Record findings.\n4. Transfer the Grape Agar Disc to a Food Vial to monitor Viability During Development\nOnce the numbers are recorded (hatched embryos/L1/L2), use a spatula to carefully transfer the grape agar disc to a vial large enough to accommodate a 35 mm disc containing Drosophila food media prepared according to manufacturer’s instructions (refer to list of reagents). Place the grape agar disc L1-side down on the food (Figure 7).  After transferring the agar disc with larvae to the food vial, carefully inspect the empty Petri dish for any larvae left behind (Figure 7E).\nSet up a schedule to inspect food vials daily, at roughly the same time each day, to ensure L2/L3 larvae are observed making their way to the food in the vial (Figure 8).\nRecord the number of pupae and adult Drosophila (Figure 9). Keep counting until no more adults are observed and avoid counting the following generation (do not count past 9 days after observing the first adults).\nObserve and record the findings. Adjust the time frame of embryo collection, counting, and recording accordingly to the mutant stock being used.",
    "Perform a chi square analysis. The null hypothesis assumes 100% viability such that the number of adults will be equal to the number of hatched embryos and L1 originally recorded and transferred to the food vials"
