    "An overview of the procedure is given in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190528/20190528235137_2139.jpgFigure 1. Simplified workflow for determining protein redox state in Arabidopsis thaliana Flash freezing of plant tissues, protein extraction, and thiol labelingPrepare the protein extraction/thiol labeling solution (see Recipes). Keep in the dark at room temperature.Place Arabidopsis plants under intended conditions (e.g., high light conditions) for intended periods (e.g., 10 min).Prepare the liquid nitrogen in a mortar just before the sampling.Excise plant tissues (e.g., leaves) and immediately immerse it in the liquid nitrogen in a mortar. This step should be done under intended conditions. We usually use two or three fully expanded leaves from plants grown under long-day (16-h day/8-h night) conditions for 4 weeks (50-100 mg of fresh weight).Grind plant tissues using a pestle. Transfer the powdered plant tissues to the microcentrifuge tube carefully.Add the protein extraction/thiol labeling solution. For our conditions described in Step A4, more than 300 μl of the solution (3-6 μl/mg leaf fresh weight) should be added. Then, keep in the dark at room temperature for 1 h to allow free thiol groups to be fully labeled with AMS. AMS is a maleimide reagent reactive with the free thiol, but not with the disulfide bond.Heat the protein sample (e.g., at 95 °C for 5 min).Centrifuge at 20,000 x g, room temperature for 10 min.Transfer the supernatant to a new microcentrifuge tube for removing the debris.Determine the protein concentration using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (according to the manufacturer’s instructions). An equal amount of the protein extraction/thiol labeling solution should be added to the albumin standards. In our conditions described in Steps A4-A6, the protein concentration is estimated to be 4-6 mg/ml in most cases.Note: Usually, the protein sample is stable at -30 °C for several months.SDS-PAGE and Western blottingPrepare the polyacrylamide gel for SDS-PAGE.",
    "We usually use the separating gel with a size of 85 x 60 x 1 mm.Note: The optimal concentration of acrylamide is variable depending on the protein of interest. The molecular mass is a critical determinant. For example, we use the 10% acrylamide gel for detecting ATP synthase CF1-γ subunit (ca. 35,000) or fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase; ca. 40,000), and the 15% acrylamide gel for detecting m-type Trx (ca. 12,000) (Figure 2). Set the polyacrylamide gel to the electrophoresis tank. Pour the electrophoresis buffer (see Recipes).Load the protein sample (equivalent to 10-40 μg of proteins) to each well. Run the electrophoresis.Note: The optimal amount for sample loading is variable depending on the protein of interest. The migration time for SDS-PAGE is important for better separation of proteins in the reduced and oxidized forms, which is also variable depending on the protein of interest. Prepare the PVDF membrane and absorbent papers for Western blotting. The PVDF membrane must be hydrophilically treated with the methanol (for several seconds) and then the transfer buffer (for several minutes; see Recipes) prior to the use.Set the polyacrylamide gel after SDS-PAGE, the PVDF membrane, and the absorbent papers to the blotting equipment. Run the blotting.After the blotting, wash the PVDF membrane with distilled water and then TTBS (see Recipes) for several minutes.Incubate the PVDF membrane with 2% (w/v) blocking agent dissolved in TTBS (e.g., overnight at 4 °C).Incubate the PVDF membrane with the primary antibody diluted with TTBS (e.g., at room temperature for 2 h).Wash the PVDF membrane with TTBS (e.g., 10 min x 3 times).Incubate the PVDF membrane with the secondary antibody diluted with TTBS (e.g., at room temperature for 1 h).Wash the PVDF membrane with TTBS (e.g., 10 min x 3 times).Incubate the PVDF membrane with the ECL Prime solution. Detect the luminescence.",
    "Note: The optimal conditions for the immunoreaction (Steps B6-B11) and the signal detection (Step B12) are largely variable depending on the protein of interest. The dilution ratio of antibodies should be carefully tested. If the signal is weak, it may be helpful to use the immunoreaction enhancer (e.g., Can Get Signal, Toyobo) or the high-sensitivity detection reagent (e.g., ECL Select, GE Healthcare)."
