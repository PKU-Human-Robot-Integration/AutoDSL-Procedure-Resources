    "Samples from BrC patients were obtained from the tissue bank of the Unidad de Investigación en Virología y Cáncer, Hospital Infantil de México Federico Gómez. This study was approved by the scientific, ethical, and biosecurity review boards of the Hospital Infantil de México Federico Gómez: Comité de Investigación, Comité de Ética en Investigación and Comité de Bioseguridad. All patients were prospectively enrolled and were informed about the nature of the study: those willing to participate signed a written informed consent prior to specimen collection and were treated according to the ethical guidelines and best clinical practice of the institution. The identity of the participants was anonymized for the duration of the study. Patients included were diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma, histological grade 2 and clinical stage II, with no previous neoadjuvant therapy before tissue resection. Patients were all female aged on average 56.8 years old (range 42 to 75)14.\n1. 3D Cell Cultures\nSeed 0.1 x 106 MCF-10A cells or primary BrC cells in 25 cm2 culture flasks with DMEM/F12 culture medium supplemented with 5% horse serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, 100 ng/mL cholera toxin, 0.5 µg/mL hydrocortisone, 10 µg/mL insulin, and 20 ng/mL of Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF). Seed 0.1 x 106 commercial BrC cells, MCF-7 cells, and MDA-MB-231 cells in 75 cm2 culture flasks with DMEM/F12 culture medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. Incubate at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 environment.",
    "After 48 h, rinse the cell monolayer with 10 mL of sterile 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Trypsinize the cell monolayer with 3 mL solution of 0.05% trypsin and 0.48 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) for 5-10 min at 37 °C. Add 200 µL of the corresponding serum to stop trypsinization and 7 mL of medium without supplements. Resuspend the cells by pipetting and remove an aliquot of 10 µL to count cells in a Neubauer chamber.\nIn each well of an 8-well chamber slide system, spread a 40 µL base of pure ECME, followed by an incubation of 30 min at 37 °C.\nIn each well, place 800 cells resuspended in 400 µL of DMEM/F12 (without phenol red) supplemented as in step 1.1 but with the following changes: for primary BrC cells and MCF-10A cells, add 4 ng/mL of EGF and 2% ECME; for MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, only add 2% ECME.\nIncubate cultures at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 environment. Replace culture media every 48 h.\nRecord morphological changes of cells every 24 h for 15 days with an optical microscope. To analyze the morphology of primary BrC cells, MCF-10A and MDA-MB-231 cells are good reference cell lines for examples of ordered acinar formation and disordered aggressive cancer-like structures, respectively.\nObtain images of cells in bright field microscopy at 100X and 200X of magnification and compare cell morphology with reference MCF-10A and MDA-MB-231 cell lines (Figure 1).\n2. Obtaining Primary Cancer Cells from Tumor Tissue\nNote: To obtain tumor epithelial cells use tissue from resected primary tumors from BrC patients with no previous neoadjuvant therapy; avoid necrotic areas and work with a minimum of 0.5 cm3 of tumor tissue.\nRinse tumor tissue with sterile 1x PBS and mechanically disaggregate it with a scalpel into 1-2 mm fragments.",
    "Digest the tissue in a sterile 20 mL glass vial with cap for 2 h at room temperature (RT) with 2 mL of the follow solution: mix 1 mg/mL collagenase type I and 100 U/mL hyaluronidase in DMEM/F12 medium containing 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin, with constant stirring.\nFilter the resulting suspension through sterilized pieces of tulle to eliminate large pieces of undigested tissue. Then filter the cell suspension through a sterilized 100 µm-pore membrane.\nPellet the cells at 430 x g for 5 min at RT and wash them twice with sterile 1x PBS. Culture primary cells in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 5% horse serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, 100 ng/mL cholera toxin, 0.5 µg/mL hydrocortisone, 10 µg/mL insulin, and 20 ng/mL of EGF. Replace the medium every 48 h. Maintain cultures at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 environment.\nEnsure that the isolated cells are epithelial cells with a standard protocol of immunocytochemistry14. Test three epithelial markers: a panel of cytokeratins (PanCK), mucin-1 (Muc-1), and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM).\n3. Isolating PM cells from Peripheral Blood\nExtract approximately 40 mL of peripheral blood from a healthy volunteer, dilute the blood in a 1:3 proportion with sterile endotoxin-free 1x PBS, and subject it to a density gradient separation.\nIn a conical tube, place 2 mL of a polysucrose and sodium diatrizoate medium with a density of 1.077 g/mL. Carefully and slowly overlay 8 mL of the diluted blood. Centrifuge for 30 min, 765 x g at RT. Use the slowest acceleration-deceleration speed of the centrifuge.\nNote: After the centrifugation, four layers will be formed from bottom to top: the red blood cells pellet, the density gradient medium layer, the mononuclear cells layer (it appears as a fine white ring), and the plasma layer.",
    "Carefully retrieve the mononuclear cell layer from the gradient with a sterile Pasteur pipette and wash them three times with 1x PBS, each time followed by slower centrifugation (430, 275, and 191 x g) for 10 min at RT.\nUse negative selection protocols to avoid activation of cells. An example of such a protocol is the following:\n\t\nWash the mononuclear cells once with a washing buffered solution (0.5% bovine serum albumin, 2 mM EDTA in 1x PBS). Count the cells in a Neubauer chamber and adjust them to a density of 1 x 107 cells/30 µL of a buffered solution.\nFor every 1 x 107 cells, add 10 µL of a FcR blocking reagent and 10 µL of a monocyte biotin-antibody cocktail that contains anti-human CD3, CD7, CD16, CD19, CD56, CD123, and Glycophorin A (included in commercial kits).\nMix the cells and incubate for 15 min at 4 °C. Add an additional 30 µL of the washing buffered solution plus 20 µL of anti-biotin microbeads (included in the kit); mix cells and incubate for 20 min at 4 °C.\nWash the cells once with a buffered solution, centrifuge at 430 x g for 5 min at RT, and resuspend in 1.5 mL of buffered solution for magnetic separation.\nLoad the cell suspension on a pre-rinsed magnetic separation column and add 7 mL of buffered solution. Collect the monocyte-enriched fraction in a 15-mL conical tube, count the cells, and if not cultured immediately, freeze monocytes at a density of 2 x 106 cells/1 mL of DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 50% FBS and 10% DMSO at −80 °C.\nNote: Avoid using monocytes after more than 2 months of freezing, as their viability can be compromised.",
    "Maintain cultures of PMs in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 6% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin, at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 environment.\nPerform each set of experiments utilizing PMs from at least two different donors independently, as pooling monocytes from different donors can result in monocyte activation.\n4. Establishing 3D Co-cultures\n3D co-cultures with indirect interaction\n\tNote: Perform these assays in 24-well flat-bottom culture plates using polycarbonate cell culture inserts with membranes of 0.4 µm pore size. In this assay, both supernatants and cells can be retrieved at the end of the experiment.\n\t\nCultivate 2 x 106 U937 and THP-1 monocytes in 10 mL of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic, and cultivate fresh PMs in supplemented DMEM/F12 medium (as indicated earlier in step 3.5), at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 environment.\nPlate 4 x 105 monocytes in 1 mL/well of their corresponding medium (supplemented with 2% ECME and 2% FBS for U937 and THP-1 monocytes, or 2% ECME and 6% FBS for PMs).\nPlace an insert in each well and add 0.9 mL of the 4 x 105 BrC cell suspension in the corresponding medium (supplemented with 2% ECME and 2% FBS for commercial cell lines or 5% horse serum for primary BrC cells). Replace half of total media every 48 h.\nIncubate at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 environment for 5 days and recover the supernatants. Retrieve cells by trypsinization if subsequent analysis is performed.\nInclude controls of individual cell cultures with the respective media.\n3D co-cultures with direct interaction",
    "Label BrC cells and monocytes with different fluorescent dyes before cell culture to allow independent sorting of each cell lineage after culture for analysis of mRNA and protein expression. Use commercially available derivatives of coumarin and rhodamine that freely pass through the cell membrane of living cells. A general protocol for labeling is the following:\n\t\t\nPrepare a monolayer of BrC cells of interest (2 × 106 cells in a 25 cm2 culture flask) and replace the standard medium with sufficient pre-warmed working solution of the fluorescent dye (1:2,000 of the fluorescent dye in standard base medium without any supplement). Incubate 30 min at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 environment. Aspirate the dye solution and rinse gently with sufficient 1x PBS. Aspirate the PBS and add the standard medium.\nTrypsinize the cell monolayer with 2 mL of a solution of 0.05% trypsin and 0.48 mM EDTA for 5-10 min at 37 °C. Add 200 µL of FBS to stop trypsinization and 7 mL of the correspondent medium without supplements. Resuspend the cells by pipetting. Take an aliquot of 10 µL to count cells in a Neubauer chamber. Continue with the co-culture protocol after cell counting.\nPellet the cells at 430 x g for 5 min at RT (perform this first since monocytes grow in suspension). Discard supernatant and gently resuspend cells with 3 mL of a pre-warmed working solution of the fluorescent dye (1:2,000 of the fluorescent dye in a standard base medium without supplements). Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 environment.",
    "Pellet the cells again, discard the dye working solution, and gently resuspend with 5-7 mL of 1x PBS. Pellet once more, discard the PBS, and resuspend cells in 5-7 mL of standard medium. Take an aliquot of 10 µL of cell suspension to count cells in a Neubauer chamber. Continue with the co-culture protocol after cell counting.\nSet the co-culture as follows: : spread enough ECME at the bottom of the well to form an even layer in each well of a 4-well chamber slide system. Plate 20 µL of a single cell suspension containing 5 × 105 labeled BrC cells per well.\nAfter 15-20 min of incubation at 37 °C, add a suspension of 2.5 x 105 labeled monocytes in 80 µL assay medium (supplemented with 60% ECME).\nAllow ECME to solidify for 15-20 min at 37 °C.\nAdd 1 mL of a 1:1 mix of the BrC cells and monocyte culture media.\nIncubate co-cultures at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 environment for 24 h, 48 h, or 5 days to track changes at different time points.\nDegrade ECM proteins to recover the cells from the cultures. Aspirate and discard the medium, add 0.5 mL of 1x PBS with 0.1% trypsin and 0.25% EDTA, and incubate for 3 h at 37 °C. After incubation, add 0.5 mL of 1x PBS with 10% FBS to neutralize the trypsin, and resuspend the cells by pipetting vigorously to obtain a single-cell suspension.\nPellet cells at 765 x g for 5 min at RT, discard the supernatant, and resuspend the cells in 5 mL of 1x PBS with 10% FBS. Repeat this step once.\nSubject the cell suspension to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) with the appropriate instrument. Ensure that the final populations are at least 95% pure).",
    "After sorting, wash the cells with sterile 1x PBS, pellet (430 x g for 5 min at RT), and resuspend in sterile 1x PBS. Cells can be processed according to specific protocols for RNA isolation or protein analysis.\nRepeat each assay three times, including 3D cultures of each individual cell lineage as controls.\nDirect interaction of 3D co-cultures to assess collagen degradation\nEstablish 3D cell co-cultures as described in step 4.2, with the additional step of adding 32.5 µg/mL of type IV collagen labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate to the ECME. The final concentration of collagen IV in the ECME is 0.5%. Grow the cultures in a 35-mm coverslip placed in a Petri dishes.\nSpread a layer of 40 µL of ECME in the bottom of the Petri dish. Allow ECME to solidify at 37 °C.\nAdd 2.5 x 105 BrC cells in 10 µL of the medium and allow cells to settle down.\nAdd a suspension of 1.25 x 105 U937 monocytes in 40 µL assay medium (supplemented with 60% of DQ-Collagen IV labeled-ECME).\nAllow ECME to solidify for 15-20 min at 37 °C.\nAdd 2 mL of a 1:1 mix of BrC cells and monocyte culture media.\nIncubate the co-cultures for 5 days at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 environment. Replace culture media every 48 h.\nAnalyze the fluorescence emission in a confocal scanning microscope and measure the integrated optical density (IOD) per 50 µm2 of culture. Compare IODs against individual cultures and the culture at time zero (Figure 2).\n5. Analysis of Supernatants from 3D Co-cultures with Indirect Interaction",
    "After 5 days of co-culture, recover the supernatants from both the upper and the lower compartments of the 3D co-cultures, and from the individual 3D culture controls. Mix well each supernatant by pipetting. Aliquot, and store the supernatant at −20°C until use (up to one month).\nNote: Keep supernatants at −80°C if storage will be longer than one month.\nAnalyze the supernatants with multiplexing assay platforms, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), or bead-based immunoassays following the manufacturer's recommended procedures.\nNote: Supernatants can also be analyzed by Western blot or concentrated through specific pore filters to obtain size enriched protein fractions to perform zymography analysis16,17. Alternatively, use the supernatants as conditioned media for other experiments, as described below. Conditioned media is usually obtained from a 5-day culture (Figure 3).\n6. Characterization of the Effects of Supernatants from Primary BrC cells on Acini Formation and Acini Structure\nIn each well of an 8-well chamber slide system spread a 40 µL base of ECME and let it solidify for 30 min at 37 °C.\nSeed 800 MCF-10A cells/well in 400 µL of supplemented DMEM/F12 culture medium, as described in step 1.2.\nAdd 400 µL of conditioned media or supplemented DMEM/F12 culture medium with 20 ng/mL of human recombinant IL-1β.\nPlace the chamber slide into a glass petri dish containing a 35 mm petri dish filled with 2 mL of PBS to create a humidity environment.\nReplace the media/supernatant every 48 h.\nRecord glandular acini formation every 24 h for 14 days with an optical microscope.",
    "After 14 days of culture, stain acini with 100 µL of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) at a concentration of 100 nM in 1x PBS to observe cell nuclei. Incubate for 25 min at RT in constant stirring. Rinse three times with 1x PBS for 5 min, each time in constant stirring at RT. Mount the preparations with a mounting medium specific for fluorescent staining. Seal with transparent polish and maintain protected from light at 4 °C.\nAnalyze the acini with a confocal microscope taking images of transversal stacks at different depths of the acini (Figure 4A, B, C).\nVisualize different cellular proteins in the acini with proper staining protocols. For instance, E-cadherin was stained to assess cell-to-cell adhesion, cell polarity, and/or lumen formation18 (Figure 4D).\n7. Migration Assays\nNote: Perform migration assays of U937, THP-1, and fresh PMs in 24-well flat-bottom culture plates using polycarbonate cell culture inserts with membranes of 8 µm pore size. It was previously demonstrated that the chemokines GM-CSF, MCP-1, and RANTES were found secreted at high concentrations in individual 3D cultures of the aggressive BrC cell lines. It was proposed that these cytokines were critical to attracting monocytes to the site of the primary tumor; this was tested in migration assays using the cytokines as chemoattractants.\nCulture U937, THP-1, or fresh PMs as described in step 4.1.1.\nRinse once each insert with 200 µL of RPMI 1640 without sera to hydrate the membrane.\nFill it with 50 µL of cold ECME, place the inserts in a 24-well flat-bottom culture plate, and allow the ECME to polymerize for 1 h at 37 °C.",
    "Add 180 µL of RPMI without FBS in the upper compartment of the plate. Add in the lower chamber without bubbling 800 µL of RPMI supplemented with either 100 ng/mL of GM-CSF, MCP-1, or RANTES as chemoattractant. Use medium without the cytokines as a negative control. Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C to establish a chemokine gradient.\nPlace 1.5 x 105 of each type of monocyte in a sterile tube, wash twice with 1 mL of 1x PBS, and centrifuge at 430 x g for 5 min at RT. Resuspend monocytes in 20 µL of RPMI without FBS, place them in the inserts, and very carefully homogenize the cell suspension (the final volume of the upper chamber is 200 µL).\nAllow the cell migration to progress for 24 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 environment.\nNote: As monocytes are non-adherent, migratory cells will usually be in the media of the lower compartment.\nRemove the inserts, retrieve the media, and count cells at 2, 4, 6, and 24 h using a Neubauer chamber or a flow cytometer; alternatively, especially if no cells are found in the media, acquire images of the lower part of the inserts with a digital camera. The mean cell count from 3 random fields (at 100X magnification) is used for the analysis (Figure 5).\n8. Invasion Assays\nNote: Perform invasion assays of the BrC cells in 24-well flat-bottom culture plates using polycarbonate cell culture inserts with membranes of 8 µm pore size. In our original studies, IL-8 was one of the cytokines enriched in the supernatants of the BrC cell/monocyte 3D co-cultures. Whether this cytokine was participating in the invasion of the BrC cell lines was tested.",
    "Expand BrC cells in 75 cm2 flasks. MCF-7, T47D, HS578T, and MDA-MB-231 as described in step 1.2 (but without ECME) and primary BrC cells as described in step 2.4.\nWash once each polycarbonate 8 µm-pore membrane cell culture insert with 200 µL of medium without sera (the medium used depends on the cell line tested) to hydrate the membrane.\nFill the insert with 50 µL of cold ECME (1:4 dilution ECME:cold medium without FBS), place the inserts in a 24-well flat-bottom culture plate, and allow the ECME to polymerize for 1 h at 37 °C.\nOnce the ECME has polymerized, add 180 µL of the respective cell media without FBS. Add 800 µL media without FBS through the slits of the insert. Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C to establish an IL-8 gradient.\nNote: Avoid creating bubbles in the media. Media used is without FBS but supplemented with 100 ng/mL of IL-8 as a chemoattractant, or pure media without FBS, as negative controls.\nObtain a total of 6 x 105 cells of each cell line as follows:\n\t\nDiscard supernatants, rinse once with 10 mL of 1x PBS, and add 2 mL of 0.05% trypsin/0.48 mM EDTA for 2 min at 37 °C to detach the cells. Add 4 mL of supplemented medium to stop the trypsin reaction and resuspend vigorously by pipetting.\nTake a 10 µL aliquot of the cell suspension to count the cells in a Neubauer chamber. Take a volume of cell suspension containing 6 x 105 cells. Centrifuge at 430 x g for 5 min at RT, discard the supernatant, and rinse cells in 1 mL of 1x PBS. Repeat the rinse once more.",
    "Resuspend the cells in 20 µL of the respective media without FBS and place in the inserts containing 180 µL of the respective media without FBS. Carefully homogenize the cell suspension by pipetting.\nAllow the cell invasion to progress for 48 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 environment.\nAfter 48 h, remove the insert, discard the supernatant and rinse the insert once very carefully with 200 µL of 1x PBS. With a cotton-tipped applicator remove the excess of PBS.\nNote: The invasive cells usually are attached to the other side of the insert as in this case where cells are adherent.\nFix the cells by placing the insert in a well of a 24-well flat-bottom culture plate containing 1 mL/well of 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at RT. Afterwards, rinse the inserts once with 1x PBS.\nStain the cells by placing the insert in a well of a 24-well flat-bottom culture plate containing 1 mL/well of 1x PBS with 0.2% crystal violet for 45 min at RT. Carefully, with a cotton-tipped applicator remove all the ECME from the top of the membrane, which contains cells that did not migrate, and rinse very carefully with distilled water to avoid eliminating fixed invasive cells.\nCount the invading cells by observing the lower side of the insert under the inverted microscope. The mean cell count from 3 random fields (at 100X magnification) is used. In cases where the cells have invaded as clusters and are difficult to count individually, acquire images from 3 random fields (at 100X magnification) with a digital camera. Analyze the images with software for image analysis and use the IOD to quantify cell invasion (Figure 6).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
