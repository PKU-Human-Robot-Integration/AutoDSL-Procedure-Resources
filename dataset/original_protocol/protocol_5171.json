    "Establishing behavioral chamber and programmed olfactory cue and reward deliveryObtain and set up operant conditioning behavioral chamber for miceSet up must include modular odorant and water delivery ports. Programming training stages for associative learning requires a computer that can run Med-PC IV software. Med-PC IV software utilizes a proprietary programming language that the experimenter must learn to program training stages. Specific requirements for each stage of training include:For all stages: Trials are blocked into 20 trials per block to compute per-block performance of each mouse. Stage 1: The program must specify that the mouse receives a water reward when its nose pokes into the center water delivery port. Output parameters for this stage are: time duration of trial and number of rewards received. Stage 2: The program must specify that the mouse receives water reward from two side ports only after it pokes its nose into the odor delivery port (center port). Water should be dispensed immediately after center poke even if the mouse does not go to the side ports for the reward. Output parameters: time duration of trial, number of trials initiated and number of timely rewards (received within 5 sec of a nose poke in the center port).Stage 3: The program must specify the delivery of the Go (S+) odor upon nose poke to the center port. The water reward should be only dispensed if mouse nose pokes the side ports within 5 sec of odor delivery. The program must also automatically shape the behavior of mice with a 50 msec step-wise increase (from 100-400 msec) in the length of time required for a center port nose poke to yield a reward.",
    "If within a block of 20 trials the mouse pokes in the center port long enough 80% of the time, the program should increase the required time by 50 msec. Output parameters are identical to those in stage 2 plus number of rewards received and percent correct response in all trials.Stage 3: Pseudo-training: This program is utilized for control groups of mice that undergo training without association of Go or No-Go (S-) odors to either reward or punishment. All parameters are the same as normal stage 3 except S+ odor will not be introduced. Stage 4A: At this stage, the program must start with all trials delivering Go/S+ odorant like stage 3. When mice complete 1-2 blocks of Go/S+ trials with > 85% accuracy, the experimenter can program randomized delivery of the S-/Go odor for half of the trials. 2 sec ‘time out’ punishment will be given if the mouse inaccurately seeks a water reward after the No-Go cue. To help mice distinguish between Go and No-Go trials, the experimenter can program the side lights on the chamber near the ports to be on during Go trials and off during No-Go trials. Output parameters are: Time duration of trial, Number of trials initiated (Number of center port nose pokes), Number of trials completed (Number of center port nose pokes longer than 400 msec), % correct response, Number of rewards received. Stage 4B: The program must increase the ‘time out’ punishment for mice to 4 sec. Output parameters are identical to those in stage 4A.Stage 4: Pseudo-training: Same as stage 4B except reward and punishment are assigned randomly to Go/S+ and No-Go/S- odors.",
    "Go/No-Go: This stage represents ‘testing’ phase and can be performed on a novel pair of odorants to test how accurately odor associations are made for experimental versus control mice. Output parameters are identical to those in stage 4A. If side lights were programmed in stage 4A, the program should now eliminate these side light cues.Associative learning (Go/No-Go) taskPreparation of mice [3 days]3 days prior to preliminary training, water is restricted to 40 ml/kg/day and mice are habituated to the testing environment and chamber.Preliminary trials of water restriction on control animals may be performed to determine the minimum volume of water provided to maintain performance in the behavioral task without surpassing humane endpoints (National Research Council 2003) as determined by the experimenter’s IACUC guidelines. In our hands, 40 ml/kg/day per mouse sufficed to maintain performance while avoiding bodyweight loss in excess of 15% of each animal’s baseline. This endpoint was established due to the ability of rodents to compensate to a gradual water restriction paradigm, and sustain losses up to 15% of their baseline body weight, without displaying indicators of distress (Rowland, 2007)During water restriction, mice must be weighed daily to ensure that they are above 85% of baseline mass. If mice fall below this threshold, they are removed from the study and provided free water.Note that as with other behavioral paradigms, results can vary exquisitely with small changes in procedure. Therefore, before the start of training, ensure that all environmental factors (temperature, noise, stray odors) remain constant throughout the protocol and that the experimental observers do not introduce random variation (e.g., the scent of perfumes or irregular changes in observers/handling procedure).Preliminary training [8-24 days]Mice are divided into control, pseudo-trained, or trained groups.Control mice receive no further treatment.",
    "Pseudo-trained mice are treated similarly to the trained group, except each trial yields reward and punishment at equal probability regardless of the odor presented.Trained mice are subjected to a Go/No-Go olfactory associative learning paradigm.Configure the behavioral chamber to have only one central port available to deliver water. (Figure 3A)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170425/20170425201158_2941.jpgFigure 3. Port configurations in behavioral chamber. Stage 1 contains a center water port (A) with the side ports inaccessible. All other stages including the Go/No-Go testing stage are performed with a central odor port and two water side ports (B).Pseudo-trained and trained mice are subjected to the following phases of preliminary training.Stage 1 [1-3 days, 60 min/mouse/day]: mouse learns to associate the chamber with the presence of water. 1)Allow each mouse to explore the chamber and discover that the port delivers water.2)Completion criteria: 100 trials within 60 min. Notes: 1)The sound of the water valve may startle mice, and they might stop performing. If mice are too afraid to explore, ‘free’ water can be offered. This is done by using the timed output option on the software to deliver ~200 msec worth of water into the water delivery port. 2)If a mouse freezes or stops exploring despite free water delivery as above, allow the mouse to stay in the chamber until the end of 60 min. Remove and repeat this stage on the following day for that mouse. 3)Empty any solid waste from the mice between trials. Spray and wipe the chamber with 70% ethanol between cages of mice to prevent odor distraction. 4)Even within groups, mice display natural variability in performance. Thus, mice can be promoted to stage 2 as a group when the average performance is within a reasonable range of the standard above (100 completed trials within 60 min).",
    "Stage 2 [1-5 days, 60 min/mouse/day]: Mice are taught to nose poke into the center port for an automatic water reward that will be dispensed from both side ports. 1)Configure the chamber to have one central port for odor delivery and two side ports for water delivery (Figure 3B). This will be the chamber set up for the remainder of the experiment. 2)Completion criteria: 40-50 + trials in 60 min, with at least 25-50% timely rewards. Timely rewards are those received within 5 sec of a nose poke in the center port.Stage 3 [1-3 days, 60 min/mouse/day]: Mice must first poke into the center port then the side port within 5 sec to get a reward. Further, mice must nose-poke in the center for longer and longer times (up to 400 msec) before seeking water at either of the side ports for a dispensed reward. This stage also introduces the Go/S+ odor paired with a water reward.1)Completion criteria: > 60 rewards within 60 min.2)Apply stage 3 pseudo-training to the pseudo-trained control group, but do not introduce the S+/Go odor.Stage 4A [1-2 days, 60 min/mouse/day]: This stage trains mice on the Go vs. No-Go task and introduces the No-Go/S- odor, along with a 2 sec time out punishment for the mouse seeking a water reward on the No-Go cue. The program will start with all Go/S+ odor presentation. Parameters can be switched to 50% Go/S+ and 50% No-Go/S- trial after the mouse performs well on 1-2 blocks of all Go/S+ trials.1)Completion criteria: 40 trials with > 60% correct responses.2)Apply stage 4 pseudo-training to the pseudo-trained control group.Stage 4B [5-11 days, 60 min/mouse/day]: this stage increases punishment time to 4 sec for mice incorrectly seeking rewards on a No-Go/S- trial or failing to seek a water reward on a Go/S+ trial.",
    "1)Completion criteria: > 100 trials within 60 min at > 85% accuracy.Notes:1)It is helpful to keep daily track of not only the total % correct, but also the max % and min % correct for each session, to monitor each mouse’s progress during this stage. 2)In our hands, 85-90% of control mice reach the completion criteria. If the study requires that the mice continue into the Go/No Go testing phase, we recommend exclusion of mice who do not meet these criteria moving forward, as they have not demonstrated adequate ability to perform the task.3)The experimenter may wish to program a ‘reversal’ training trial at the end of this stage, wherein the Go and No-Go odors are swapped in their position on the odor vial platform. This is to ensure that the mice are not cueing to another stimulus (e.g., the sound of a specific valve associated with one or the other side port).Go/No-Go trial [1 day, ~20 min/mouse/day]Mice promoted beyond stage 4B of training have now sufficiently learned the behavioral task and can be exposed to novel odor pairs to test their ability to discriminate between new odors (e.g., stereoisomers such as + and - limonene). The parameters of Go/No-Go trials are like those of stage 4B, with the exception that a 300 msec nose poke in the center port is sufficient for mice to execute either the Go or No-Go action.Enter experimental details into the program. Load each mouse into the chamber and select the correct program to run from the on-screen interface.The endpoints or variables of statistical analysis are determined by the experimenter, but in our hands, control mice will often display accurate performance with new odor pairs (> 85% correct responses) after approximately 200-400 trials or 10-20 blocks."
