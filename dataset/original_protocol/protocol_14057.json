    "1. Preparation of Culture Media and Reagents\nProliferating medium: supplement William's E medium with GlutaMAX, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 5 μg/mL insulin and 0.5 μM hydrocortisone hemisuccinate.\nDifferentiation medium: supplement William's E medium with GlutaMAX, 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 5 μg/mL insulin, 50 μM hydrocortisone hemisuccinate and 2% DMSO.\nFreezing medium: supplement proliferating medium with 10% DMSO.\nSodium oleate: dissolve in 99% methanol at a 100 mM concentration, stir O/N, and store at -20 °C.\nOil Red O: prepare a stock solution. Weigh 0.35 g of Oil Red O and dissolve in 100 mL of isopropanol. Stir O/N, filter (0.2 µm), and store at RT. Prepare a working solution: mix 6 mL of Oil Red O Stock solution with 4 mL of ddH2O. Let sit at room temperature (RT) for 20 min, and then filter with a 0.2 µm filter. Proper filtration is highly recommended for successful staining to avoid background.\nBodipy (505/515): dissolve Bodipy (505/515) dye in DMSO at a 100 µM stock concentration, store at -20 °C in dark, and use at a final 100 nM concentration.\nAcquire transparent glass-bottomed dishes for CARS experiments.\n2. Thawing, Amplification, and Cryopreservation of HepaRG Cells\nThaw nitrogen cryopreserved HepaRG cells by immersing a batch in a 37 °C bath until defrosted. Select a low passage batch (<20). HepaRG cells are commercially available.\nRapidly transfer the cells into a 15 mL tube containing 10 mL of proliferating medium and centrifuge for 5 min (200 x g, 4 °C).\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cells with 5 mL of proliferating medium.\nCount the cells and dilute in order to plate 2.5 x 104 cells/cm2.\nRenew the medium every 2 or 3 days. Cells proliferate with a doubling time of around 24 h.",
    "Detach HepaRG cells when at 80% confluency by 3-5 min incubation with trypsin solution 0.05%. Collect the cells in proliferating medium and centrifuge for 5 min (200 x g, 4 °C).\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cells with 5 mL of proliferating medium.\nCount the cells and dilute in order to plate 2.5 x 104 cells/cm2.\nAt this stage, amplify the cells by repeating steps 2.5-2.8 in order to reach an appropriate number of cells to start experiments, or cryopreserve as in step 2.10.\nTo cryopreserve HepaRG cells, detach the cells 24 h after plating by 3-5 min incubation with trypsin solution 0.05%. Collect the cells in proliferating medium and centrifuge for 5 min (200 x g, 4 °C). Discard the supernatant, resuspend the cells in 1 mL/batch of freezing medium, 1.5 x 106 cells/batch and cryopreserve the batches in liquid nitrogen.\n3. Differentiation of HepaRG Cells (Day 0–21) (Figure 1A)\nDay 0. Seed HepaRG cells at low density (2.5 x 104 cells/cm2) into culture treated dishes with appropriate volume of proliferation medium (Figure 1B). Two dishes need to be plated for each assay (Oil Red O staining, FACS analysis, qPCR): one for control cells and one for oleate-treated cells. If performing CARS measurements (step 8), seed the cells in parallel into transparent glass-bottomed dishes. As a control, harvest one untreated dish (proliferating cells Day 0) to perform gene expression analysis of differentiation marker genes (see step 3.6).\nDay 2 and Day 4. Change the medium with appropriate volume of proliferation medium and let the cells grow until confluence.\nDay 7. Cells must be 100% confluent (Figure 1C). Wash the cells once with 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Remove 1x PBS and add an appropriate volume of differentiation medium.",
    "Day 8, 9, 12, 15, 18.  Wash the cells once with 1x PBS. Remove 1x PBS and add an appropriate volume of differentiation medium.\nDay 21. Observe HepaRG cells under a microscope and ensure that the cells are confluent differentiated cultures (Figure 1D).\nAs a control, harvest one control dish (differentiated cells Day 21) to perform gene expression analysis (step 7) of differentiation marker genes (Figure 1E).\nAt Day 21, differentiated HepaRG cells can be cryopreserved in liquid-nitrogen.  \n4. Induction of Vesicular Steatosis (Day 21–26)\nDay 21. Dilute sodium oleate (100 mM) with an appropriate volume of complete differentiation medium to a final concentration of 250 μM (1:400). Add 99% methanol 1:400 (same volume as that of sodium oleate) into another aliquot of differentiation medium to make the vehicle-control treatment. (For instance: add 25 μL of sodium oleate to 10 mL of medium and in parallel add 25 μL of 99% methanol to 10 mL of medium). Wash the cells once with 1x PBS and add vehicle or sodium oleate medium.\nDay 23 and Day 25. Change the medium with appropriate volume of freshly prepared medium as in step 4.1.\nDay 26. Observe by optical microscope that lipid droplets accumulate in the sodium oleate-treated cells and are easily visible as translucent droplets in the cytoplasm as in Figure 2A.\n5. Evaluation ofLipid Overloading and Steatosis Induction: Oil Red O Staining\nWash he cells once with 1x PBS and remove 1x PBS completely.\nAdd 4% paraformaldehyde (diluted in 1x PBS) and incubate for 15 min at RT.\nCAUTION: Paraformaldehyde is toxic, so this step must be performed in a fume hood, with protective equipment, including gloves, a lab coat, and a mask.",
    "Remove paraformaldehyde and wash the cells twice with 1x PBS. Cells can be kept in 1x PBS at 4 °C for a couple of days before staining. Wrap with parafilm and cover with aluminum foil to prevent the cells from drying.\nRemove 1x PBS. Incubate the cells with 60% isopropanol for 5 min at RT.\nRemove isopropanol and let the cells dry completely at RT.\nAdd Oil Red O working solution and incubate at RT for 30 min. The volume of working solution required for each sample corresponds to the volume of media used for culturing the cells.\nRemove Oil Red O solution and immediately add ddH2O. Wash the cells 4 times with ddH2O.\nAcquire images under the microscope for analysis (Figure 2B).\nTo elute Oil Red O dye: remove all the water and allow to dry; add 1 mL of 100% isopropanol and incubate for 10 min with gentle shaking at RT.\nPipet the isopropanol with eluted Oil Red O dye up and down several times, ensuring that all the Oil Red O is in the solution. Transfer the solution to a cuvette. Measure OD500 nm by spectrophotometry and use 100% isopropanol as blank (Figure 2C).\n6. Evaluation of Lipid Overloading and Steatosis Induction: Bodipy Staining and Cytofluorimetric Analysis  \nWash the cells once with 1x PBS. Incubate with 100 nM of Bodipy diluted in 1x PBS in the dark for 40 min at 37 °C. An unstained control should be included in the flow cytometry measurements. From this point, protect the samples from light as much as possible.\nNOTE: The volume of staining solution required for each sample corresponds to the volume of media used for culturing cells.",
    "Remove staining solution and wash the cells once with 1x PBS. Proceed to steps 6.3-6.6. for FACS (Fluorescence-activated cell sorting) analysis or to step 6.7 for microscope imaging.\nGently scrape the cells with 1x PBS and transfer it into a 15 mL tube. Centrifuge for 10 min (200 x g, 4 °C).\nGently remove the supernatants without disturbing the pellets and wash with 3 mL of 1x PBS. Centrifuge for 5 min (200 x g, 4 °C).\nRemove the supernatants and resuspend in 300 μL of 1x PBS, then transfer into a FACS tube.\nImmediately measure Bodipy fluorescence intensity by cytofluorimetric analysis with excitation/emission wavelengths of 505/515 nm (Figure 3A,B).\nWash the cells once with 1x PBS and remove PBS completely.\nAdd 4% paraformaldehyde (diluted in 1x PBS) and incubate for 15 min at RT.\nCAUTION: Paraformaldehyde is toxic, so this step must be performed in a fume hood, with protective equipment, including gloves, a lab coat, and a mask.\nRemove paraformaldehyde and wash the samples 3x for 5 min in PBS. Cells can be kept in 1x PBS at 4 °C or imaged immediately (Figure 3C). For storage, wrap with parafilm and cover with aluminum foil to prevent the cells from drying.\n7. Evaluation of Lipid Overloading and Steatosis Induction: qPCR\nWash the cells once with 1x PBS. Scrape the cells with 1x PBS, centrifuge at 200 x g, and discard the supernatant. At this step, cells can be harvested at -80 °C or processed as in step 7.2.\nPerform total RNA isolation by standard methods using commercial reagents following manufacturer's instructions.\nAssess RNA concentration by UV spectrophotometric measurement, ensuring that the RNA purity is high (close to 2.0) based on the A260/A280 reading.\nSynthesize cDNA from 1 μg of total RNA with a standard cDNA synthesis kit.",
    "Dilute cDNA to a final 50 μL volume with H2O.\nAnalyze each cDNA sample in triplicate by qPCR: prepare one qPCR master mix (Table 1) that is sufficient for the needed reactions for each primer, including primers specific for the three housekeeping genes as controls: gliceraldeide-3-fosfato deidrogenasi (GAPDH), actinB and ribosomal 18S (see Table of Materials for primer sequences):\nDispense 18 μL of master mix per well in a PCR multiwall plate.\nAdd 2 μL of cDNA sample in each well. Seal the plate.\nRun the samples according to the Thermal Cycler instruction.\n8. Evaluation of Lipid Overloading and Steatosis Induction: CARS\nFix the cells previously prepared on glass-bottomed dishes, as described in steps 5.1-5.3.\nSwitch on a commercial tunable picosecond pulsed laser system, tuning it to obtain two outputs of different wavelengths. The frequency difference between the outputs must be 2,840 cm-1 to generate the intense CARS light signal corresponding to methylene symmetric stretching; for a fixed-wavelength output at 1,064 nm (\"Stokes\" light), the other wavelength should be tuned to 817 nm (\"pump\" light).\nEnsure the 817 nm output is spatially and temporally overlapped with the 1,064 nm output: use an appropriate dichroic mirror (i.e., with a cut between 817 and 1,064 nm) to spatially combine the beams and use an optical delay line to obtain temporal overlap of the laser pulses.\nEnsure the two copropagating beams are both collimated and that their diameters have similar values that are appropriate for the optical system within the microscope that will focus them onto the sample; if necessary, separately collimate the beams before the dichroic mirror that combines them.\nSwitch on a commercial inverted microscope system, which should include an infrared laser scanning unit and a dual-channel red/green epi detection unit and align the copropagating laser beams into the scanning unit.",
    "Opening the dual-channel epi detection unit, remove the filter cube and replace its red-wavelength detection filter with a bandpass filter that can select the 2,840 cm-1 CARS signal that is centered at 663 nm for the 817/1,064 nm pump/Stokes excitation scheme. A narrow-bandwidth (20 nm) filter is preferred to avoid the collection of high levels of fluorescent background signals.\nPlace a dish on the stage of the inverted CARS microscope, and using a 100x oil-immersion objective, shift the vertical position of the objective to focus on the cells.\nSet up the microscope software to collect high-resolution (1024 x 1024 pixels) images over a field of view spanning 127 μm x 127 μm.\nSet the microscope software to continuously acquire and display images of the 127 μm x 127 μm field of view and check the displayed images whilst optimizing the image collection parameters. Ensure that the laser powers are balanced for rapid image collection and minimal damage, inserting appropriate neutral-density filters in the beam paths as necessary, and select a pixel dwell time that allows the collection of images with a good signal-to-noise ratio under the selected laser power conditions.\nAcquire and save images of several different fields of view within the dish under the optimized conditions. Optionally, multiphoton fluorescence images, generated by a green-wavelength emission (mostly from two-photon excitation at 817 nm), may be simultaneously collected via the other epi detector. Repeat steps 8.7-8.10 for each dish.\nFor the CARS image analysis, process images using the FIJI implementation of ImageJ. Operate the Despeckle function (or a similar denoising tool) on each image before further analysis to improve signal-to-noise ratios without loss of detail.",
    "Use FIJI to select cells manually and then automatically count lipid droplets within segmented individual cells to produce statistics on lipid droplet areas and numbers for each cell and for the entire image dataset for each dish.\n9. MTT Cell Viability Assay\nPlate differentiated HepaRG cells into a 96-well plate with a density of 1 x 105 cells/well in a final 100 μL volume of differentiation culture medium.\n24 h after seeding, treat the cells with 99% methanol (vehicle) and with 100 μM, 250 μM and 500 μM sodium oleate and sodium palmitate diluted in 100 μL of differentiation culture medium/well in triplicate.\nChange the medium with 99% methanol and with 100 μM, 250 μM and 500 μM sodium oleate and sodium palmitate diluted in 100 μL of differentiation culture medium/well every 24 h.\n96 h after methanol/sodium oleate/sodium palmitate treatment, treat the cells with 2 μM doxorubicin diluted in 100 μL of differentiation culture medium/well in triplicate as a control.\n18 h after doxorubucin treatment, change the medium with 100 μL of differentiation culture medium.\nPipet 20 μL of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium reagent MTT (Table of Materials) into each well of the 96-well assay plate containing the cells in 100 μL of differentiation culture medium. Include a background control by pipetting 20 μL of reagent into a control well without cells in 100 μL of differentiation culture medium in triplicate. \nIncubate the plate at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere.\nAfter incubating for 30, 60, and 90 min with MTT tetrazolium reagent, record the absorbance at 490 nm using a 96-well plate reader. Subtract the background absorbance of the no-cell control wells from the absorbance values for the other samples.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
