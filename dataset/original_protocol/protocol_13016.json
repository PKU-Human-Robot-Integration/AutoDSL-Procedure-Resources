  "procedures": [
    "The Committee reviewed the Protocol on Scientific Conduct and Ethics of the Alfonso X el Sabio University. Also, a group of scientists external to the research team checked and approved the complete experimental process. To allowing participation in the study, it was necessary to sign an informed consent accepting to enroll in the program, as recommended by the Declaration of Helsinki30. Before enrollment, it was ensured that none of the participants would suffer any psychological stress or harm resulting from the intervention.\n1. Carry out the field study\nNOTE: The experimental design follows a mixed design, with between-subject measurements (experimental and control groups) and repeated measurements before and after treatment. This experimental design makes it possible to isolate the effect of treatment (the results obtained in a specific body satisfaction program) from other variables related to the individual differences since body satisfaction was measured before and after treatment. The study also compares the treatment with what happened when participating in a non-specific intervention program (control group) isolating the manipulation effect during the intervention. Participants were randomly allocated in the experimental and control conditions, guarantying the optimal conditions for the experiment to be conducted.\nSelection of research tools\n\t\nChoose a psychosocial program aimed at improving body image in older people adequate to the goal of the study. In this case, the option chosen was IMAGINA program by Sánchez-Cabrero (2012)26 as it meets all the requirements.\n\t\tNOTE: The criterion to select the experimental instrument were the following: (1) it had to be a program specifically for body satisfaction; (2) it must be perfectly adapted to older people; (3) it must be a group-program emphasizing social interaction between participants; (4) it has to last 6 to 10 session of 60-120 minutes each, so attitudinal and behavioral changes could be achieved consistently.",
    "Choose a general psychosocial program for older people to work in groups that meet all the required conditions and serve as a control comparison. In this experiment, the program is 'Promoting Healthy Aging: Consistent Health', run by the Spanish Red Cross31 since it was the best option available.\n\t\tNOTE: The criterion to select the control program are that (1) it must build upon positive social interaction without focusing on body image; (2) it must be designed for working in groups; (3) it must be appropriate for older people; (4) it must have a schedule similar to the experimental intervention program.\nChoose a scientific instrument to evaluate body image satisfaction in older people. The Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ) by Cooper, Taylor, Cooper, and Fairburn (1987)33 was regarded as the most suitable instrument for the research goals.\n\t\tNOTE: The criterion to select the scientific instrument to evaluate body satisfaction in old age were that (1) it must be a peer-reviewed and published instrument; (2) it measures body satisfaction and has convergent validity with other scientific instruments; (3) it must be short and simple to adapt to the older population (3) it must be translated to Spanish and scaled for the Spanish population.\nDesign a questionnaire (Supplementary File 1) to gather all demographic data and intervening variables to control in this study.\n\t\tNOTE: The sociodemographic data regarding age, gender, and relationship status was gathered with an ad hoc specific questionnaire. Age was treated as a quantitative and discrete variable and the rest as dichotomous categorical variables. As for 'season of the year' and 'residence environment', this information was registered by the researcher in charge of the experiment.\nSampling method\n\t\nRequest the collaboration of a non-profit organization (NGO) that carries out psychosocial programs of group-application for older people in different locations.",
    "Select ten different locations to apply the experimental and control psychosocial programs. Half of them lived in the countryside (places with less than 1000 residents), and the other half lived in metropolitan towns and cities.\nApplication of experimental and control interventions\n\t\nPerform the pre-treatment measurement of BSQ. Individual measures were gathered with paper and pen, but the participants were in the same space as their cluster group.\nDo over eight sessions of both psychosocial programs (control and experimental) in ten locations.\n\t\tNOTE: The programs were under the same person's supervision at two different seasons of the year: summer and winter. In both cases, the activities were done in the evening, for 4 weeks, and twice a week. In both programs, participants worked in groups, having playful activities and social gatherings, which drastically reduced participants' withdrawal.\nGather the post-treatment measurement of the BSQ.\n\t\tNOTE: Individual applications were gathered with paper and pen, but the participants were in the same room with their cluster group. This was made right after finishing the sessions. The BSQ was not applied to those individuals who did not come to all sessions. Consequently, results from 10% of the sample were omitted in the final analyses.\n2. Digitize the data obtained in the field study\nOpen the statistical software and go to File Menu | New | Data, click on the Data icon and then go to Variable View (Figure 1) and create a statistical variable for each one of the following variables shown in Table 1.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4\nVariable Name,Type,Values,Measure,Description\nBSQ Pre-treatment measurement,Numerical,34-204,Scale,Numerical result obtained in the pre-treatment\nBSQ Post-treatment,Numerical,34-204,Scale,Numerical result obtained in the measurement post-treatment\nExperimental Condition,Dichotomous variable,\"{0, CONTROL} / {1, EXPERIMENTAL}\",Nominal,Whether or not the participant has been in the experimental or control condition\nGender,Dichotomous variable,\"{0, Man} / {1, Woman}\",Nominal,The biological gender of the participant",

Do the same with the demographic and attributive data of the questionnaire.\n\tNOTE: The results obtained with the BSQ and the information regarding the study's socio-demographic data were collected in paper and pen, so it was necessary to digitalize it one by one.\n\t\nCreate a new variable with the difference between the pre- and post- BSQ measurement in the statistical software (data obtained with the test). To do so, go to Transform | Compute Variable, and in the pop-up menu assign a name in Target Variable gap, then select the pre-treatment variable from the menu Type & Label… and move it to Numeric Expression gap, then click on the subtraction icon (-) on the calculator.",
    "After, select the post-treatment variable from the Type & Label menu and move it again to Numeric Expression gap. Finally, click on the OK, and then the variable that accounts for the difference between pre- and post-measurement is created (Figure 3).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62506/62506fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: How to import research data to the statistical software package.
