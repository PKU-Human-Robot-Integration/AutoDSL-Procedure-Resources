Circadian and sleep analysis are then conducted.\nIf focusing on foragers as in Tasman et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25], these can be selected by only using bees seen coming out of the colony and feeding at feeders in the foraging arena, with a thorax diameter of approximately 5 mm (the average size for foragers, (Goulson et al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28]). In honeybees and bumblebees, nurses show an attenuation of circadian rhythms so experiments should be mindful of which bees are included in their study. Collect an adequate sample size, using several different colonies to control for any colony specific effects. In Tasman et al., (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25] we collected 30 foragers each from 4 colonies, providing a sample size of 40 foragers for each treatment.\nLoad bees into individual tubes in the adapted LAM set up and monitor for five day in 12 h light and 12 h dark (LD) conditions, followed by five days of constant darkness (DD). Activity bouts (recorded via infra-red (IR) beam crosses by the LAM), should be summed into bins for analysis. We used 30 min bins (Tasman et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]), but other studies have used 60 min bins (Chittka et al 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Smaller bins will provide more fine scale analysis of activity.",
    "Circadian analysis should then be carried out. There are a range of circadian analyses and the specific ones chosen will depend on the focus of the study. We chose to calculate the rhythmicity statistic, period length and total daily activity levels, as these are common measures and provide information on how active the foragers are, how strong their locomotor rhythms are and the length of their free running period. The gives a good basic overview of the function of the clock. Below is a description of how to measure these, with some example data provided in the quantification and statistical analysis section:\nThe rhythmicity statistic (RS) is a measure of rhythmicity strength. It calculates the auto correlation of locomotor activity on consecutive days. Conventionally, an RS greater than 2 is rhythmic, an RS of 1.5–2 is weakly rhythmic, and an RS less than 1.5 is arrhythmic (Hodge and Stanewsky, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). The RS is calculated using conventional autocorrelation analysis. First, the data are filtered, using a low-pass Butterworth filter to remove any periodicities of less than 4 h.\nThe dataset is then paired with itself, gradually moved out of register with itself and the correlation coefficient plotted. At 0 h, the two data sets are identical, and then, for rhythmic data, they return to high correlation approximately every 24 h.",
    "The value of the third peak in the auto correlogram is reported as the rhythmicity index (RI), a statistical representation of the rhythmicity of the bee’s activity (example shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). The Rhythmicity Statistic (RS) is calculated as the ratio of this RI to the value of the 95% confidence line (Levine et al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]). The period length is also calculated from the auto correlogram, by calculating the time between the peaks in correlation. This analysis can be carried out using FlyToolBox (Levine et al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]) in MATLAB (MATLAB and Statistics Toolbox Release 2015b).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/718-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. An example of an auto correlogram for locomotor activity, from which period length, RI and RS can be calculated\nThe day and night activity levels for each bee can be calculated using the daynight program (Julienne et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]) in MATLAB. The individual bee’s period length is used to split the activity data into subjective days and nights and then the activity counts for each are summed. The mean daily activity in daytime and night-time for the five days are then calculated.\nNote: LD and DD data should be split and analyzed separately.",
    "Sleep analysis should be carried out on the five days of LD (Buhl et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]), using activity data that have been summed into both 1 min and 30 min bins. In invertebrates, bouts of inactivity lasting more than 5 min tend to be quantified as sleep (Beyaert et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3], Nagari et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19], Eban-Rothschild and Bloch, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). Analysis can be performed using the Sleep and Circadian Analysis MATLAB Program (SCAMP, Donelson et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). Again, there are many ways to quantify sleep. We calculated mean total sleep per 30 min bin, as well as mean number and length of sleep episodes per day. This gives a good overview of the quantity and structure of sleep achieved by the individual. An example of the sort of sleep analysis that can be provided by SCAMP can be seen in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/718-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. An example sleep plot for a control bee, taken from Tasman et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]\nThe plot shows the mean quantity of sleep (± SEM) achieved every 30 m of the 24 h period in LD conditions.\nNote: Measuring sleep under LD is standard practice for this sort of analysis as users can accurately measure what quantity and quality of sleep is occurring in the day compared to the night. It is also more relevant to field conditions. Locomotor activity is measured in DD to give an insight into the function of the endogenous clock when external cues are removed.\nCritical: As mentioned in the ‘before you begin’ section, it is essential that foragers have been given at least 3 days in the colony to entrain to the 12 h: 12 h LD schedule before they are collected and used in the LAM.",
    "Note: Other values can be extracted from the SCAMP program, such as sleep latency (the time after lights turn off before first sleep bout).\nNote: Only bees that showed activity bouts up until the end of the experiment were included in analysis, to remove any inactive or dead bees.\nCritical: Data from the LAM must be processed by the DAMFileScan 108× (free to download from www.trikinetics.com[href=http://www.trikinetics.com]) and then the ‘.txt’ extension has to be removed from the file name before it can be used by FlyToolBox. For a full description of how to use the FlyToolBox see Levine et al, 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17].\nCritical: When setting up the LAM, make sure to set the program to collect data every 1 min, so that it can be summed into both 1 m and 30 m bins (or whatever size bin is being used for the activity data), allowing the data to be used for both circadian and sleep analysis.\nForaging rhythmicity assay for colonies\nTiming: 10 days\nCircadian rhythmicity within the colony can be assayed using a micro-RFID setup (Microsensys GmbH), (Stelzer and Chittka, 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]). This is used to monitor the movement of foragers in and out of the colony and to estimate their foraging activity and rhythmicity.\nApproximately 40 foragers should be collected from the foraging arena, in the same way as previously described in the LAM set up. They should be anesthetized using CO2, and an RFID tag (Microsensys GmbH mic3-TAG) stuck to the center of their thorax with superglue (Loctite) as in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]. Foragers should then be returned to the colony nest box.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/718-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. An example of RFID-tagged Bombus terrestris foragers",
    "After a day for acclimatization and recovery from the CO2 exposure, recording can begin. An RFID reader (Microsensys GmbH iID®MAJAreadermodule4.1) is placed at the entrance to the foraging arena so that foragers pass through the reader to enter the arena. The data from the readers are collected on a host (microsensys GmbH iID®HOSTtypeMAJA4.1), for a 10-day period; 5-day LD and 5 day DD, as in the LAM experiments above.\nThe data are then summed into bins, 30 min or other, as required by the experiment, with each pass through the reader being counted as a single activity bout. These data can then be analyzed in the same way as the individual locomotor data above, to provide in and out bout rhythmicity data for each tagged forager.\nNote: Sometimes foragers sit in the reader, causing continuous reading of their RFID tag by the reader- this is discussed in the trouble shooting section.\nCritical: As mentioned in the ‘before you begin’ section, it is essential that foragers have been given at least 3 days to entrain to the 12:12 LD schedule before recording begins.\nNote: Only those that showed foraging activity every day of the study period were used for analysis, ensuring that only foragers were assessed. For control groups in our study (Tasman et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]) this was 24, 27 and 29 bees per colony. For the treatment group this was 10, 17 and 21 bees per colony.",
    "Note: For these experiments, passing through the reader was taken as a single in/out activity bout and the number of bouts in total was taken as a measure of foraging activity. This is like other rhythmicity analysis carried out with bumblebees using RFID tags (Stelzer and Chittka, 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]). However, if the experimenter wants to also look at the length of foraging bouts etc. then two readers could be used, one at the entrance to the colony and one at the entrance to the foraging arena, to determine directionality of the foragers. This is discussed further in the limitations section."
