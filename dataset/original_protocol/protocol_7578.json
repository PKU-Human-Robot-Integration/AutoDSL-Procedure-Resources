    "Membrane oxygenator preservation post-use Disconnect membrane oxygenator from ECLS system pump.Flush membrane oxygenator from the inlet port with 1× PBS and drain blood/PBS flush from the outlet port until flush exiting outlet is clear (standardize flush flow rate to the flow rate in which the ECLS device is operated).Connect inlet and outlet tubing (10–15 cm length) into a closed loop with 3/8\" × 3/8\" connector (Figure 1).Attach needleless injection port to 3/8\" × 3/8\" straight connector.Inject SEM fixative into the oxygenator via a priming port using a 50 mL syringe while simultaneously withdrawing air from the oxygenator via a separate port. This process is continued until the membrane is saturated with fixative.Store the membrane oxygenator in the refrigerator (4 °C) until ready for section B.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4814/bioprotoc-13-18-4814-g001.jpgFigure 1. Membrane oxygenator preservation with SEM fixative Membrane oxygenator disassembly (General note 1) Drain SEM fixative slowly into SEM fixative/buffer waste bottle.Rinse the membrane oxygenator with 500 mL of 1× PBS.Unscrew and disassemble membrane oxygenator pump using a T10 Torx screwdriver.Take digital images of membrane oxygenator pump, inlet face, and outlet face of the membrane oxygenator on sterilization wrap (use as a blue background) with labels and pathology metric ruler. Examples are in Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4814/bioprotoc-13-18-4814-g002.jpgFigure 2. Example images of (a) membrane oxygenator pump, (b) inlet/top/pre-membrane/venous face of the membrane oxygenator, and (c) outlet/bottom/post-membrane/arterial face of the membrane oxygenator Cut off water connections to get a flat edge, then cut off post-membrane sample port on outlet side so that the membrane can sit flat on the miter saw table (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4814/bioprotoc-13-18-4814-g003.jpgFigure 3.

Example of individual membrane gas fiber sheet for digital imaging Cut top inlet, middle, and bottom outlet membrane gas transfer fiber sheets each into nine squares (total 27 squares). Number squares from top inlet membrane gas fiber sheet from 1 through 9, middle membrane gas fiber sheet from 10 through 18, and bottom outlet membrane gas fiber sheet from 19 through 27, as shown in Figure 7.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4814/bioprotoc-13-18-4814-g007.jpgFigure 7. Schematic diagram of cutting individual membrane gas fiber sheets and numbering. Numbers 1–9 are assigned to inlet/top membrane gas fiber sheet (left), numbers 10–18 are assigned to middle membrane gas fiber sheet (middle), and numbers 19–27 are assigned to outlet/bottom membrane gas fiber sheet (right).Place randomly selected squares into labeled cassettes with the surface that was closest to the membrane inlet facing the lid of the cassette facing upward.Place cassettes with sample into 120 mL container, add SEM fixative, and store in refrigerator (4 °C) until ready for section D.",
