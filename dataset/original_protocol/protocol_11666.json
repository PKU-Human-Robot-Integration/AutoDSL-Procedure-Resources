    "All subjects must give informed written consent before the administration of experimental protocols. All procedures, consent forms, and the experimental protocol were approved by the Research Ethics Committee of National Taiwan University.\n1. Comparing the Frequency Effect between the Lexical Decision and Naming Tasks in Chinese Character Recognition (Experiment 1)\nRecruit the Participants\n\t\nRecruit forty-four students from National Taiwan University to participate in both the LDT and the naming task. The participants must be native Chinese speakers with normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and fluent in listening, speaking, reading and writing Mandarin. All of them were right-handed.\nMaterials\n\t\nSelect a total of 180 characters from Chinese character database of Wu and Liu (1987). Use 90 high-frequency characters and 90 low-frequency characters. According to Wu and Liu (1987), the high-frequency character is defined by the occurrence more than 100, and the low-frequency is defined by the occurrence from 1 to 15, among a total frequency of about one million in the database. Balance the important lexical characteristics (frequency, number of strokes, and/or other properties, etc.) of the materials chosen across conditions.\nBased on the phonology of the phonetic radical and the character, ensure that the characters contain three regularity types: regular, in which the phonetic radical and the character share the same pronunciation (ignoring the tones); irregular, in which there are differences between their pronunciations; and non-phonogram, in which the character cannot be defined as a phonogram.\nClassify each character into one of the six categories: (1) high-frequency, regular (e.g., imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53815/53815figBAO.jpg, bāo, compatriot) (2) high-frequency, irregular (e.g., imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53815/53815figBING.jpg, bīng, ice) (3) high-frequency, non-phonogram (e.g., imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53815/53815figDUAN.jpg, duàn, section) (4) low-frequency, regular (e.g., imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53815/53815figBAN.jpg, bàn, stumble) (5) low-frequency, irregular (e.g., imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53815/53815figFEI.jpg, fēi, wife of a prince) (6) low-frequency, non- phonogram (e.g., imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53815/53815figDUO.jpg, duò, lazy). Each category contains 30 characters.",
    "Using TrueType (built in the Windows OS), construct 180 pseudo-characters by keeping the right radical of the characters and changing the left radical to another one. Make sure that there is no significant difference in the numbers of strokes between the characters and pseudo-characters.\n\t\t\nStart the TrueType program. When a dialog box appears, click the OK button and start the program to construct the pseudo-characters. Click the Windows-Reference in the menu, then a reference panel will show up and choose a proper font.\nInput one real character in the blank box of the panel and click the OK button. Two panels will appear side by side on the screen. In the right panel of constructing characters, use the tool of Free Selection button to select the left radical of this real character with a circle. Move the left radical to the left panel of constructing characters. Then the left radical of the pseudo-characters has been made.\nClick the Windows-Reference in the menu again, and adopt the similar procedures to select the right radical of another real character. Move the right radical to the left panel of constructing characters. Put the two radicals together and make sure the combination of those two radicals is meaningless in the lexicon. A pseudo-character has been constructed. Then save the pseudo-character in the computer.\nAdopt a frequency (high, low) by regularity (regular, irregular, and non-phonogram) within-subject factorial design. Set the type of task as a between-subject variable.\nRandomize all the items.\nThe LDT\n\t\nUse a standard experimental software, such as the E-Prime, to program the experiment according to software protocols.\nMake sure that 50% of the stimuli are characters for the \"Yes response\" and the others are pseudo-characters for the \"No response\".",
    "Ask the participants to judge whether the written stimulus appearing on the screen is a real character or not. Instruct them to respond as accurately and quickly as possible by pressing one of two keys, one is for \"Yes response\", and the other is for \"No response\". Remind all the participants to use right hand when making responses.\nStart each trial with an asterisk to indicate a fixation point at the center of the monitor for 500 msec, accompanied by a 100 Hz warning tone for 200 msec, followed by a blank screen appeared for 500 msec.\nAfter the asterisk, show the target character, which subtends a visual arc of approximately 2 degrees, from a 70 cm viewing distance, until the computer detects the participant's key stroke, and measure the response time (RT) from the onset of the target character until a key-press response is made.\nSet the time interval between one trial and the next with a blank screen for 1,000 msec. The computer will record the RT and accuracy rate of the participants' responses in the LDT by keyboard pressing.\nProvide all the instruction both in written format on computer screen and verbally, and participants performed the task individually.\n\t\tNOTE: In the exemplar experiment 1, the task included a practice session having 20 trials with feedback. During the experiment session, participants had a rest every 36 trials. A typical session including the practice one will take a participant 25 - 30 min to complete.\n2. Comparing the Frequency Effect between the Lexical Decision and Naming Tasks in Chinese Word Recognition (Experiment 2)\nRecruit the Participants\n\t\nRecruit thirty-six students from National Taiwan University to participate in both the LDT and the naming task. The recruitment criterion is the same as that in Protocol 1.\nMaterials",
    "Select a total of 288 two-character words, in which half of them are real words and the other half are pseudo-words. According to Wu and Liu (1987), the high-frequency word is defined by the occurrence more than 50. Balance the important lexical characteristics (frequency, and/or other properties, etc.) of the materials chosen across conditions.\nBased on the phonology of the phonetic radical and the character, ensure that the leading character within the words contains three regularity types: regular, in which the phonetic radical and the character share the same pronunciation (ignoring the tones); irregular, in which there are differences between their pronunciations; and non-phonogram, in which the character cannot be defined as a phonogram.\nControl the leading characters within the real words for frequency across regularity types and make sure that the leading characters within the pseudo-words (e.g., imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53815/53815figXIANQUE.jpg, xiàn què) are different from those in the real words.\nAdopt a frequency (high, low) by regularity (regular, irregular, and non-phonogram) within-subject factorial design.\nClassify each word into one of the six categories: (1) high-frequency, regular leading character (e.g., imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53815/53815figBUZHI.jpg, bù zhì, arrange) (2) high-frequency, irregular leading character (e.g., imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53815/53815figBANYAN.jpg, bàn yǎn, play the role) (3) high-frequency, non-phonogram leading character (e.g., imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53815/53815figBOSHI.jpg, bò shì, doctor) (4) low-frequency, regular leading character (e.g., imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53815/53815figBUJU.jpg, bù jú, distribution) (5) low-frequency, irregular leading character (e.g., imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53815/53815figBANXIANG.jpg, bàn xiàng, actor in costume) (6) low-frequency, non-phonogram leading character (e.g., imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53815/53815figBOXUE.jpg, bò xué, eruditely).\nAssign all the stimuli into two blocks, and make each block correspond to a task type. Counterbalance the order of blocks among the participants.\nRandomize all the trials within each block.\nThe LDT\n\t\nUse a standard experimental software, such as the E-Prime, to program the experiment according to software protocols.",
