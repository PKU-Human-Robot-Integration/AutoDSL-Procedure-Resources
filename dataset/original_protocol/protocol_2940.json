    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPrepare the assay plate\nTiming: 1 h\nIn this step, the protein is thawed and mixed with iron (II) sulfate and ascorbate in the reaction plate to ensure the protein contains its optimal concentration of Fe2+.\nPrepare the protein.\nThaw the protein on ice.\nDilute protein to 7.5 μM with lysis buffer.\nNote: 1050 μL of protein solution is sufficient for one 96-well microplate, including a few repeats due to mistakes.\nPrepare the plate.\nNote: The total reaction mixture will be 150 μL.\nPipette 10 μL of iron (II) solution into each well.\nAdd 110 μL of reaction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.00).\nNote: If an HPPD modulator is being used, then add 108.5 μL of reaction buffer (1.5 μL is the volume of the modulator). See the optional step in the next major step section.\nAdd 10 μL of protein prepared at step 1b.\nNote: A negative control should always be included and is made by adding 10 μL of lysis buffer instead of protein.\nMix the solution using a multichannel pipette.\nAdd 10 μL of the ascorbate solution.\nMix the solution using a multichannel pipette.\nCover the plate with aluminum foil.\nIncubate for 30 min at 37°C.\nPrepare the substrate.\nWhile the plate incubates, create dilutions of the 4-HPP solution ranging from 0–30 mM. This will yield a range of 0–2 mM final concentration (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2684-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Representative illustration of 4-HPP dilutions and plate set-up",
    "(A) Using a stock solution of 30 mM, the substrate is diluted to the desired concentrations. The stock solution of 4-HPP is prepared the day before, as described in the protocol. The color gradient shown in this figure does not represent the actual color you will observe, and it was only used to indicate 4-HPP dilutions.\n(B) A representative example of the reaction set-up using a 96-well microplate. The microplate includes the experimental run (+HPPD) and blank (-HPPD), running in triplicates. The color gradient shown in this figure does not represent the actual color you will observe, and it was only used to indicate 4-HPP dilutions.\nNote: The color gradient shown in this figure does not represent the actual color you will observe, and it was only used to indicate 4-HPP dilutions.\nFor HTS of HPPD modulators, prepare a singular 4-HPP concentration of 12 mM (0.8 mM final).\nComplete the reaction\nTiming: 2 h\nAt this point, the reaction will be initiated by adding 4-HPP (substrate) into the protein mixture. An example plate layout using the substrate gradient is provided (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: The color gradient shown in this figure does not represent the actual color you will observe, and it was only used to indicate 4-HPP dilutions).\nOptional: Introduce a modulator.\nAdd the modulator at the desired concentration.\nNote: See step 2b. If the modulator is dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the volume should be 1.5 μL so the final concentration of DMSO remains constant at 1%. Otherwise, the enzymatic activity may be affected. Along with the modulator, do not forget to include a DMSO control.\nMix the solution.\nInitiate the reaction.\nAdd 10 μL of the substrate solution at the desired concentration.\nMix the solution.\nCover the plate with aluminum foil.\nReact to completion.",
    "Incubate for 2 h at 37°C.\nCritical: At this point the enzyme converts 4-HPP to homogentisate. Different incubation time periods were tested and the two-h one was found to be the optimal.\nDetection of remaining 4-HPP\nTiming: 16 h\nEnd the enzymatic reaction.\nRemove the tray from the incubator and place it into a fume hood.\nAdd 150 μL of methanol to each reaction well.\nNote: Methanol will terminate the enzymatic reaction and shift the keto/enol-HPP equilibrium towards the enol form. Previous studies have demonstrated that in the presence of methanol enol-HPP is form at 100% and remains stable for long periods of time (1 month).3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3],4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] Conversion of keto-HPP to enol-HPP is required in step 7b in order to form a complex with borate.\nMix the solution.\nCentrifuge at 2100xg for 15 min, at 4°C.\nNote: This step is necessary to remove any precipitate that is formed due to the presence of methanol.\n4-HPP detection in the form of enol-HPP/borate complex.\nFrom each well, transfer 50 μL of the clear solution to a corresponding well of a new microplate (e.g., A1 of microplate 1 to A1 of microplate 2).\nAdd 100 μL of borate solution into each well.\nMix the solution.\nRecord a first reading using a plate reader at 306 nm.\nNote: The values of the experimental runs and the blank should look similar at this point (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nSeal the plate with an alumnaseal film and cover the entire plate in foil.\nNote: Any quality sealing film should work.\nCritical: If the plate is not sealed, the methanol will evaporate before the final readings, which will cause the assay to fail.\nRead the absorbance at 306 nm every h for 16 h.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2684-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "(A) Analysis of the experimental run (+HPPD) and blank (-HPPD) over the period of 16 h. In the absence of 4-HPP, the two groups demonstrate negligible absorbance differences.\n(B) In the presence of 0.8 mM 4-HPP, the experimental run (+HPPD) and blank (-HPPD) demonstrate district absorbance patterns, which are associated with the activity of HPPD.\n(C) The single point readings at t = 16 h show that the assay is suitable for HTS experiments. The presence of NTBC (HPPD inhibitor) greatly reduced the ability of the protein to catalyze the conversion of 4-HPP to homogentisate. Data were plotted using three replicates and expressed as mean ± SD.\nCritical: If the plate is not resealed between readings, methanol will evaporate, and the absorbance readings will be affected.\nNote: In the absence of 4-HPP, the absorbance readings of experimental run (+HPPD) and blank (-HPPD) should overlap (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). To observe differences between the two, plot one of the 4-HPP concentrations. At 0.8 mM of 4-HPP, the experimental run and blank demonstrate clear differences (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). For HTS experiments, use the single point readings, at time point 16 h (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]) and if available an HPPD inhibitor (e.g., NTBC) as a positive control (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C)."
