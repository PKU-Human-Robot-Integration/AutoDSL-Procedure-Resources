    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nStep one: Cell isolation and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)\nPart I. From mouse bone marrow (BM)\nTiming: 7–9 h (for 10–12 mice)\nIn this step, BM cells are extracted from mouse hind leg bones. Red blood cell free and lineage deleted live cells are then stained with HSC specific fluorescently-labeled antibodies, and labeled with MMP-specific probe TMRE. Distinct MMP fractions of CD48-LSK CD150+ murine HSCs (CD150+ HSCs) are sorted using flow cytometry sorter.\nHarvest BM. 10–12 adult (8–10 weeks old) wildtype male/female mice (C57BL/6J) are required for this step.\nSacrifice, sanitize, and dissect the mice following standard operating procedure for harvesting murine tissue biopsies.\nRemove the entire tibias and femurs from both hind legs. Slice off from the joint with intact metaphysis. Try not to break the bones.\nNote: Higher number of HSCs are located in the trabecular region of epiphysis and metaphysis (Morrison and Scadden, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]). To ensure both high yield and nonbiased results, the entire bone should be preserved as much as possible.\nTrim off the large muscles attached to the bones.\nClean off any remaining muscles attached to the bones by either scraping with a scalpel or rubbing off with Kimwipes. Discard the knee cap.\nRinse the bones to remove any attached hair using 2%FBS/PBS. Keep the bones in the buffer on ice.\nMove to a biosafety cabinet to maintain sterile conditions.\nHarvest BM using flushing approach (or alternative crushing approach below).\nCut off only a thin piece of epiphysis at the end of the bone.\nHold the bone shaft with a forceps and insert a 23-gauge needle attached to a syringe into the end of the bone.",
    "Completely flush BM into a 15 mL conical tube using no less than 3 mL (per mouse) 2%FBS/PBS. Flush multiple times until bone shafts turn white.\nNote: Using a finer needle to flush the BM or trying to disperse it by passing through a syringe could introduce extra shear force that is harmful to cells.\nGently pipet flushed BM up and down using a 1 mL micropipette to disperse BM aggregates.\nWash the cells with an additional 3 mL of 2% FBS/PBS by spinning down at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nCrushing approach (alternative to flushing approach above):\nBIriefly crush the bones, up to 5 legs a group, using a mortar and a pestle in a small volume of 2% FBS/PBS just enough to cover the bones.\nNote: Do not grind bones into fine pieces. Just briefly fragment bones to release BM.\nAdd ∼10 mL 2% FBS/PBS to the crushed bones. Swirl around to gently release BM from bone fragments. Pipet up and down to disperse BM aggregates using a 10 mL pipette.\nPass the cell suspension through a 70 μm cell strainer (white) placed in a 50 mL conical tube to remove bone debris.\nNote: 70 μm strainer is used for its bigger pore size that avoid being clogged by debris.\nAdd another 10 mL 2% FBS/PBS to the mortar. Collect BM cells as above. Repeat until the suspension becomes clear and colorless.\nCentrifuge at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nNote: Using flushing approach, a piece of epiphysis has to be cut off to flush the BM. And it is hard to thoroughly flush the trabecular area. For this reason, crushing may be recommended over flushing for harvesting BM from the entire trabeculae.\nIsolate Lineage negative cells from BM.",
    "Resuspend BM cells in 2 mL of 1× BD Pharm Lyse buffer to lyse RBCs.\nIncubate for 3 min in a 37°C water bath.\nAlternatives: Cells can be incubated for 15 min on ice. Both approaches work well.\nCentrifuge at 300 g for 5 min. Wash the pellet once with at least 10 mL 2% FBS/PBS.\nResuspend RBC lysed BMs (designated as total BM in the rest of the text) in 2 mL of 2% FBS/PBS.\nFilter this suspension through a 40 μm cell strainer (blue cap) to generate single cell suspension into a 5 mL FACS tube.\nTake 5 μL and make a 200-fold dilution. Count the total number of cells.\nNote: Expect to obtain 3–5 × 108 RBC- BM pooled from 10–12 mice (2–5 × 107 per mouse).\nAdjust the cell concentration to 1 × 108 cells/mL in a maximum volume of 2 mL (total cells less than 2 × 108). Use multiple tubes if the volume exceeds 2 mL.\nSave an aliquot of 1.5 × 106 cells for FACS controls.\nTo isolate lineage negative cells (Lin-) enriched BM (designated as Lin- BM), perform lineage depletion using the EasySep Mouse Hematopoietic Progenitor Cell Isolation Kit following manufacturer’s instruction (EasySep Mouse Hematopoietic Progenitor Cell Isolation Kit[href=https://cdn.stemcell.com/media/files/pis/10000003753-PIS_02.pdf?_ga=2.166253499.469207524.1654184427-243955649.1653425715&_gac=1.214123365.1654198392.CjwKCAjwv-GUBhAzEiwASUMm4jsxduPov8VU2o1UmEwRmX9WIlflKgYuK8o931GJCRP0ZTG8Kjz9oxoCRtcQAvD_BwE]).\nNote: The Isolation Cocktail in the kit is a biotin conjugated, anti-lineage antibody mixture (Lin cocktail). Biotin labeled cells are bound by streptavidin coated magnetic beads (RapidSphere) and negatively selected using a magnet.\nCount the number of isolated cells. About 1–3 × 106 Lin- BM cells per mouse (both hind legs) are expected, 5%–10% of total BM.",
    "Note: The purpose of lineage depletion is to enrich for stem and progenitor cells to increase sorting efficiency. After depletion, about 60%–80% cells are expected to be lineage negative. The remaining un-depleted lineage+ cells will be stained and gated out during FACS sorting procedures as follows.\nLabel mouse HSCs using fluorochrome conjugated antibodies and mitochondrial membrane potential specific probe, TMRE.\nPrepare sample/controls: Full Stain Sample (Lin- BM):\nResuspend Lin- BM cells at a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/mL in 2% FBS/PBS for immunostaining.\n Lin/CD48-APCCy7 positive staining control (total BM):\nResuspend ∼1 × 106 total BM (from the saved aliquot in 2.h.) in 100 μL of 2% FBS/PBS for immunostaining.\n Single staining controls (probes) for compensation (total BM):\nPrepare 3 FACS tubes labeled as TMRE, DAPI, and unstained.\nTransfer ∼104 total BM (from the saved aliquot in 2.h.) to each of the three tubes.\nAdd 200 μL of 2% FBS/PBS to the two tubes labeled as unstained and DAPI.\n Single staining controls (antibodies) for compensation (beads):\nPrepare 4 tubes of UltraComp Plus compensation beads, labeled as: CD48-APCCy7, Sca-1-PB (Pacific Blue), c-Kit-APC, CD150-PECy7.\nThoroughly vortex UltraComp Plus compensation beads. Add one droplet to each tube.\nAdd 1 μL corresponding antibody as labeled on the tube. No incubation or wash is needed.\nProtect the tubes from light. The beads are ready for flow cytometry analysis.\nImmunofluorescent staining (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]):\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2167_30.csv\nNote: Based on previously conducted titrations for mouse HSCs, use 1 μL antibody per 106 cells per 100 μL in this protocol.\nCritical: Make sure that cells are suspended at ∼ 1 × 107 cells/mL and sufficient antibodies are added. Because the majority of BM are lineage cells and CD48+ cells, these cells may not be thoroughly gated out if staining is insufficient. See troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]: Insufficient Lin/CD48 staining.",
    "Full Stain Sample (Lin- BM):\nFor every 1 × 107/mL Lin- BM cells, add 2 μL Streptavidin-APCCy7 (SA-APCCy7) and 10 μL each of the following antibodies: anti CD48-APCCy7, Sca-1-PB, c-Kit-APC, CD150-PECy7.\nMix well and incubate for 20 min on ice. Protect from light.\nWash cells with 2% FBS/PBS by centrifuging at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nPour off the supernatant quickly by tilting once.\nWhile keeping the tube inverted, aspirate off the last hanging droplet to remove all the supernatant.\nProceed to TMRE staining.\nNote: The remaining un-depleted, biotin labeled lineage cells will be stained by SA-APCCy7. In this protocol, both Lin+ cells and CD48+ cells are stained with APCCy7 and gated out altogether during FACS. The benefit of this approach is that it spares one fluorescent color. An additional surface marker of interest can be added if needed. This also simplifies the flow cytometry algorithm and increases sorting efficiency. However, this approach relies on sufficient Lin and CD48 staining and a good Lin, CD48 double negative FACS gating.\nLin/CD48-APCCy7 positive staining control (total BM):\nAdd 1 μL Anti CD48-APCCy7 antibody and 0.5 μL SA-APCCy7 to 100 μL of 106 total BM cells.\nMix well and incubate for 20 min on ice. Protect from light.\nWash the cells with 2% FBS/PBS by centrifuging at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nPour off the supernatant quickly by tilting once. Do not remove the last droplet.\nNote: This will leave ∼200 μL of buffer in the tube, which should be enough to resuspend the cells.\nPlace cells on ice and protect from light.\nTMRE staining:\nPrepare 2 mL of 100 nM TMRE staining medium in 10% FBS/IMDM pre-warmed at 37°C.",
    "Resuspend full stain sample cell pellet and cells from the tube marked as TMRE, each in ∼500 μL pre-warmed TMRE staining medium.\nIncubate for 15 min at 37°C in humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2.\nWash with 2% FBS/PBS by centrifuging at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nPour off the supernatant without aspirating the last hanging droplet, leaving ∼ 200 μL in the tube.\nDAPI staining: Full stain sample (Lin- BM):\nAdd 2% FBS/PBS to the above ∼ 200 μL cell suspension to reach 1 × 107/mL.\nAdd 1 μL of 1 mg/mL DAPI to 1 mL of full stain sample.\nFilter through a Falcon cell strainer cap into a 5 mL FACS tube.\n DAPI single staining control:\nAdd 2 μL of 100× DAPI staining solution into ∼ 200 μL cells in the tube.\n Lin/CD48-APCCy7 positive staining control (total BM):\nAdd 2 μL of 100× DAPI staining solution into ∼ 200 μL cells in each tube.\nAll samples and controls are now ready for flow cytometry analysis. Keep cells on ice and protect from light.\nSort distinct MMP fractions of CD48-LSK CD150+ HSCs (CD150+ HSCs). Sort cells using a 5 laser BD FACSAria sorter with a 100 μm nozzle and 4-way purity sorting mode. Set the temperature of the sample injection chamber to 4°C.\nMake plots over FSC/SSC, FSC-A/FSC-H, SSC-A/SSC-H, DAPI, APCCy7, APC/PB, PECy7.\nNote: FSC, SSC are plotted on linear scale, fluorescence parameters are plotted on biexponential scale.\nDraw tentative gates subsequently on each of the plots in the following order: Debris- gate (FSC-A/SSC-A) -> doublet- gate (FSC -A/-H) -> doublet- gate (SSC -A/-H) -> DAPI- gate -> APCCy7- gate -> APC+PB+ gate -> PECy7+ gate.\nSet voltage for each parameter.\nLoad the full stain sample (Lin- BM).\nAcquire just enough events to reveal populations in all gates.",
    "Adjust the voltages to appropriate ranges for each parameter.\nRemove the tube once the voltage has been set and place it on ice.\nSet compensation.\nAcquire the following single staining controls for compensation. Single staining controls with probes:   Unstained.   DAPI.   TMRE. Single staining controls with antibodies:   CD48-APCCy7.   Sca-PB.   cKit-APC.   CD150-PECy7.\nCalculate spill over matrix and apply compensation to all.\nSet the gates for CD150+ HSCs (CD48-LSK CD150+): Determine Lin-CD48- gate (Gate 1):\nAcquire Lin/CD48 positive staining control (total BM).\nOn a plot of APCCy7, the majority of total BM should be APCCy7+ (Lin+ and /or CD48+).\nSet Lin-CD48- gate according to the clear-cut bottom edge of the APCCy7 positive population, where no more than 1% should fall into the negative gate (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]Ai).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2167-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Set bottom 25% MMP-Low and top 25% MMP-High gates.\nAcquire minimal sufficient number (100,000–200,000) of fully stained Lin- BM sample.\nBetween 10%–15% cells are expected to fall into Lin-CD48- gate (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]Aii and 1Bv).\nNote: The majority of BM are lineage cells or CD48+ cells. If insufficiently stained, these cells will be gated as Lin-CD48-, indicated by unusually high percentage in this gate. Follow Troubleshooting Problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]: Insufficient Lin/CD48 staining for this.\nDetermine Sca-1+c-Kit+ gate (Gate 2):",
    "On a plot of APC against PB, four distinguished populations are revealed under Lin-CD48- gate (Gate 1) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]Bvi).\nSet Sca-1+c-Kit+ gate to include clearly separated, the most positive population. Normally 1%–4% of Lin-CD48- cells are expected in this gate (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]Bvi).\nNote: If the remaining lineage+ cells and/or CD48+ cells are not sufficiently stained and gated out, Sca-1/c-Kit profile will become mostly double negative. In that case, the percentage of Sca-1+/c-Kit+ will be unusually low (bellow 1%) and might be contaminated with CD48+ cells. Follow Troubleshooting Problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]: Insufficient Lin/CD48 staining for this.\nDetermine CD150+ gate (Gate 3):\nOn a plot of PECy7, set CD150+ gate under Sca-1+c-Kit+ gate (Gate 2) to include clearly separated, the most positive population. Normally 20%–30% of CD48-LSK cells are expected to be CD150+ (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]Bvii).\nCD150+ HSCs (CD48-LSK CD150+) can now be determined as following: Gate 1 (Lin-CD48-) -> Gate 2 (Sca-1+c-Kit+) -> Gate 3 (CD150+) (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]Bv–1Bvii).\nPlot TMRE histogram from 100 CD150+ HSCs. Gate top and bottom most 25% as MMP-High and MMP-Low (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]Bviii).\nCritical: TMRE histogram keeps fluctuating until sufficient number of parental cells (100 cells recommended; minimal 50) are acquired. Wait until a stable and fully distributed TMRE profile is shown before determining MMP gates.\nSort MMP-Low and -High HSCs into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes containing 200 μL cold StemSpan.\nCritical: Even though the sample chamber of FACS sorter is set at 4°C, cells are not cooled as efficiently as on ice (depending on the instrument). As temperature increases, TMRE profile might slowly shifts towards lower signal intensity, likely as a result of HSC dye efflux activity. Try not to leave samples in the sample chamber longer than needed. If the volume of a sample is large, divide it into multiple tubes and keep the rest on ice.",
    "Critical: MMP-Low and -High gates might need to be re-gated according to the MMP profile of each new tube loaded, if multiple tubes are used for samples with large volume. Monitor the shift of TMRE profile during the entire sorting. Finely re-adjust MMP-Low/-High gates whenever MMP-Low gate comprises more than 30% and MMP-High gate less than 20% of the entire profile.\nNote: The absolute level of MMP or the relative difference of MMP between cell types is not the focus in the studies presented in this protocol. MMP-Low and -High here are defined as the lowest and the highest 25% MMP, respectively, of a given population. Depending on the goal of the study, MMP gating strategy may vary (e.g., comparing between normal and malignant HSCs, or between young and old HSCS which may differ greatly in MMP levels) and the results should be interpreted accordingly (Liang et al., CSC, 2020; Mansell et al., CSC, 2021; Qiu and Ghaffari, Exp Hematol, 2022).\nNote: Real-time MMP gate adjustment demands a reliable TMRE profile based on sufficient cell numbers. During sorting, the number of parental cells (CD150+ HSCs) displayed for TMRE profile is limited by the maximal total events allowed for each screen refresh. Since only less than 0.1% Lin- BM are CD150+ HSCs, at least 50,000 Lin- BM cells need to be displayed with each screen refresh to give a TMRE profile of > 50 CD150+ HSCs. Set Events to Display to maximum (Displaying > 50 CD150+ HSCs is possible using BD FACSDiVa software). This also emphasizes the necessity of progenitor cell enrichment using lineage depletion kit prior to sorting. See troubleshooting problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]: Unstable TMRE histogram of CD150+ HSCs.\nAfter sorting, 4,000–5,000 MMP-Low or -High CD150+ HSCs are expected from 10–12 mice.",
    "Optional: The following step is only required for initial setup of TMRE analysis for a new cell type or staining strategy:\nValidate TMRE staining using CCCP and oligomycin.\nNote: The fluorescence intensity increases proportionally with the concentration of TMRE before reaching a self-quenching dose. The optimal TMRE concentration for non-quenching FACS analysis is typically between 20 and 200 nM, 15–30 min at 37°C. During the initial setup of the experiment, the specificity and responsiveness of TMRE staining to changes in MMP should be validated using inhibitor controls such as CCCP (carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone) and oligomycin for each cell type of interest and/or staining approach (dose, incubation time).\nTake a proportion of pooled BM equivalent to the amount of one bone for this analysis.\nPerform RBC lysis, lineage depletion and immunofluorescent staining of Full Stain Sample and controls as described in 2.a. – 3.b.\nResuspend washed Full Stain Lin- BM in 1.5 mL pre-warmed 10% FBS/IMDM. Divide the cell suspension into 3 FACS tubes, 500 μL each. Mark the tubes as NT (non-treated), CCCP, or Oligomycin.\nIn 500 μL cell suspension marked as CCCP, add 5 μL of 10 mM CCCP stock to 100 μM final.\nIn 500 μL cell suspension marked as NT, or oligomycin, add 5 μL DMSO each.\nIncubate for 10 min at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2.\nDuring this time, prepare 20 μL of 10 μM TMRE (1:10 diluted from 100 μM working stock) in 10% FBS/IMDM.\nAt the end of incubation, without washing, add 5 μL of 10 μM TMRE into each of 500 μL cell suspension (NT, CCCP, oligomycin) to a final concentration of 100 nM. Return cells to the incubator, and incubate for another 15 min.",
    "During this time, prepare 25 μL of 200 μg/mL Oligomycin working stock (1:25 diluted from 5 mg/mL stock) in 10% FBS/IMDM.\n5 min before the end of incubation, add 5 μL of 200 μg/mL Oligomycin into 500 μL cell suspension labeled as oligomycin to a final concentration of 2 μg/mL. Return cell to the incubator and incubate for the rest of 5 min.\nNote: The response to oligomycin is transient. Do not leave cells with oligomycin for longer than 15 min.\nAt the end of incubation, immediately fill the tubes with ice cold 2% FBS/PBS and centrifuge at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nPour off the supernatant without aspirating the last hanging droplet, leaving ∼200 μL in the tube.\nAdd 2 μL of 100× DAPI staining solution into ∼200 μL cells in each tube. Samples are ready for flow cytometry analysis. Keep the cells on ice and protect from light.\nPlot TMRE histogram for CD150+ HSCs gated as previously described. Overlay TMRE profiles of NT, CCCP and Oligomycin treated samples.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2167-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Validation of the specificity and responsiveness of TMRE staining to changes in MMP level using CCCP and oligomycin\nFlow cytometry histogram of TMRE for CD48-LSKCD150+ HSCs treated with CCCP (100 μM, red), or oligomycin (2 μg/mL, blue), or untreated (DMSO, 10 min, black). Depolarized and hyperpolarized TMRE gates were determined according to the peak separation on TMRE profile of CCCP and oligomycin treated samples respectively. Only 0.96% or 1.44% untreated HSCs are depolarized or hyperpolarized. TMRE intensity of 97.6% of cells are within physiological range.",
    "Note: The physiological range of TMRE fluorescence intensity should fall between the depolarized (CCCP treated) and hyperpolarized (oligomycin treated) level. CCCP increases proton permeability by decoupling the electron transfer chain from ATP synthase, which depolarizes the mitochondrial membrane (loss of proton gradient) and results in reduced TMRE accumulation. Oligomycin blocks proton re-entry into mitochondria through inhibiting mitochondrial ATP synthase, leading to hyperpolarization of mitochondrial membrane as exhibited by increased TMRE accumulation. The indication of physiological MMP in CD150+ HSCs using TMRE staining approach adapted in this protocol was validated in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]. Close to 98% of TMRE fluorescence intensity of non-treated sample is within the depolarized (CCCP treated) and hyperpolarized (Oligomycin treated) level.\nPart II. From human peripheral blood (PB)\nTiming: 10–12 h total\nTiming: 3–4 h (for 5–6 pouches of blood) for step 6\nTiming: ∼2 h for step 7\nTiming: 4–6 h for step 8\nIn this step, mononuclear cells (MNCs) are isolated from human peripheral blood. CD34+ MNCs are enriched through immunomagnetic column separation. Live cells are then stained with HSC specific immunofluorescent antibodies, and labeled with mitochondrial membrane potential – MMP – specific probe TMRE. Distinct MMP fractions of CD34+CD38-CD45RA-CD90+ Human HSCs (CD90+ HSCs) are sorted using flow cytometric sorter.\nIsolate human mononuclear cells (MNCs) from peripheral blood (PB).\nFresh, non-mobilized whole PB from normal donors are obtained from NY blood center (available as ∼ 50 mL/pouch/donor for research purpose).\nNote: Similar procedure applies to fresh cord blood (CB) and mobilized PB. Details for processing leukocyte reduction filter or frozen-thawed blood products are not included here.\nNote: Blood samples are treated as potentially infectious and are collected and processed by following standard for proper handling of blood borne biohazard.\nProcess blood samples the same day upon receipt.",
    "Critical: If same-day process is not possible, keep the blood in a cool environment and process as soon as possible. Hemolysis, aggregation, and low yield are expected if blood is not fresh. Follow Troubleshooting Problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]: Hemolysis.\nSpray blood pouches with 70% ethanol and wipe it down.\nIn a biological safety cabinet, disinfect the tubing on the pouches using alcohol prep pads.\nCut open the tubing using a clean, disinfected razor blade and release blood into 50 mL conical tubes or other sterile containers.\nNote: To minimize blood spill, do not cut off the entire tip of the tubing directly. Make a small cut first, just enough to let in some air. Once the entering air pushes the blood back into the pouch, it is safe to cut off the entire tip without spilling.\nDilute the whole blood at least 1:1 with 1 × PBS.\nCritical: Sufficient dilution of RBCs is critical for a good Ficoll separation. If poor separation occurred due to high RBC concentration, follow Troubleshooting Problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]: Poor Ficoll Separation.\nAdd 15 mL Ficoll-Paque PLUS in each 50 mL conical tube.\nLayer ∼30 mL of diluted blood on the Ficoll-Paque PLUS (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2167-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "Set the centrifuge brake to “off”, or the deceleration to the minimum level (varies depending on the centrifuge model).\nCentrifuge the blood loaded Ficoll at 800 g for 30 min at 18°C–20°C.\nCritical: 18°C–20°C is the optimal temperature for Ficoll separation. The efficiency of Ficoll separation is reduced at lower temperature (4°C), whereas RBCs tend to aggregate at a higher temperature (37°C). If poor separation occurred due to high RBC concentration, follow Troubleshooting Problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]: Poor Ficoll Separation.\nAfter centrifugation, the blood-Ficoll cocktail is separated into three layers plus a middle ring (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).       Bottom layer:       Red blood cell pellet.       (∼7.5 mL).       Middle layer:       Colorless Ficoll containing granulocytes.       (∼15 mL).       Top layer:       Yellow and clear plasma containing platelet.       (∼25–30 mL).       MNCs:       A white, thin ring between Ficoll and plasma layers.       (At ∼20–25 mL mark in a 50 mL conical tube).\nNote: With good handling, the MNC ring generated by Ficoll separation from fresh blood is expected to be white and homogeneous. The top plasma layer should appear lightly yellow and clear. Red plasma and dark red clumps in the MNC ring indicate hemolysis. If this happens, follow Troubleshooting Problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]: Hemolysis.\nGently vacuum aspirate off most of the upper plasma layer without disturbing MNC layer, leaving ∼5 mL above.\nNote: Small amount of platelet contamination from residual plasma is allowed, for HSCs are to be FACS sorted in the following steps.\nInsert a 10 mL pipette through the remaining plasma layer and collect the entire MNC layer, pooling them into 3–4 new 50 mL tubes.\nNote: Small amount of Ficoll carryover is allowed in the type of study focused in this protocol.\nNote: From this step forward, keep cells on ice, set centrifuge to 4°C and work with pre-cooled buffers.\nPellet MNCs.",
    "Set the centrifuge brake back to “on”, or the deceleration to the maximum level.\nCentrifuge pooled MNC suspensions at 300 g for 10 min at 4°C.\nRemove most supernatant without disturbing the pellets, leaving ∼ 5 mL.\nNote: Do not try to aspirate all supernatant completely, for MNC pellets tend not to be very compact at this step.\nResuspend the pellets with the remaining supernatant.\nPool all MNC suspensions into one tube.\nThoroughly rinse off any remaining cells in all tubes with small amount of 2% FBS/PBS and combine the rinse-off with pooled MNC suspension.\nCentrifuge again at 300 g for 10 min at 4°C.\nNote: MNC pellet from Ficoll separation of fresh blood is expected to be white or slightly pink (small number of residual RBCs are expected).

Set bottom 25% MMP-Low and top 25% MMP-High gates.\nNote: According to manufacturer’s instruction, 100 μL CD34 microbeads is required for every 108 MNCs. However, it is unfeasible and not necessary to purify rare HSCs from large amount of whole blood using this amount of microbeads. Based on our bench experience, 300 μL CD34 beads per 1 × 109 MNCs is sufficient to yield ∼1 × 106 CD34+ cells as expected (0.1%–0.3% CD34 in PBMNCs, Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]Ai).\nMix well and incubate on ice for 30 min.

    "Critical: To ensure smooth magnetic column separation, it is critical to filter the cells prior to load them on column. Clumps larger than 30 μm will block LS column. Keep cell density below 1 × 108 cells/500 μL. The maximum capacity of each LS column is 2 × 109. For separating more than 2 × 109 cells, use multiple columns. If slow flow or no flow through column is observed, follow Troubleshooting Problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]: Column blockage.\nNote: CD34+ cells bound to the magnetic beads will be trapped within the column. Unlabeled cells will pass through the column and flow into the collecting tube.\nCritical: Make sure cells are maintained cool. Add cell suspension to the column in small batches at a time and work quickly. Keep the remaining cells on ice.\nOnce all the cells are processed, wash the column twice with 5 mL MACS buffer.\nNote: Wait for the column to empty completely each time before adding the buffer. According to the manufacturer’s instruction, the column needs to be washed 3 times but this is not necessary for this protocol since it is followed by FACS sorting. A second round of column separation can further improve purity. However, it is not necessary in this protocol since cells will be FACS-sorted. Furthermore, additional rounds of column purification reduce overall yield. At this stage, yield is more important than purity.\nRemove the column from the separator and place it over a 15 mL conical tube.\nAdd 5 mL MACS buffer into the column. Push the plunger into the column and elute the magnetically labeled cells.\nCount the number of eluted CD34+ MNCs without dilution.",

Displaying limit is not a problem. However, due to limited availability of blood samples, regularly only 0.5–1 × 106 CD34+ cells are sorted for the type of experiments in this protocol. Low acquirement rate as a result of low cell concentration gives poor real-time TMRE profiling. Concentrate samples to under 500 μL to raise acquirement rate close to or above 100 events/second. Raising flow rate at a cost of reduced signal resolution is not recommended, since none of CD38 and CD90 profile gives well separated populations in CD34+ cells.\nStep two: Cell treatment\nTiming: 7–20 h\nFACS-sorted murine HSC fractions are treated with one of the lysosomal modulators, Concanamycin A (ConA), Leupeptin (Leu), Chloroquine (CQ), or incubated with DMSO as a control.

    "Note: Larger frame size and slower scanning speed increase resolution, but takes longer time and increases photobleaching. Averaging helps increase signal-to noise ratio and smoothen the image. Averaging line by line smoothens the image better than frame by frame but increases photobleaching. A higher scan speed with averaging gives the best signal-to noise ratio. Bit depth can be chosen from 8, 12, or 16 bit, corresponding to 256, 4,096, or 85,536 gray levels. 12 bit above is used in the work presented in this protocol. However, ImageJ software can only handle 8, 16, 32 bit. Images taken at 12 bit will be converted to 8 bit by ImageJ during processing.
