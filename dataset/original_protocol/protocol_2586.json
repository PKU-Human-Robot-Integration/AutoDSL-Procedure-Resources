DNA shearing is a critical step in the immunoprecipitation protocol. Scientists often use sonication, which imposes a risk when working with high-containment pathogens due to aerosol production and potential spread of infectious particles. Thus, we replaced sonication with enzymatic DNA shearing using Benzonase as described before.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]\nLysis of infected cells.\nPlace 15 cm dishes with infected cells on ice (process 1 dish at a time).\nCarefully remove the culture medium and wash cells with 10 mL of ice-cold 1× PBS.\nCarefully remove all of the PBS by tilting the dish (any residual amount of PBS will affect the composition of the lysis buffer). Add 2.5 mL of cold Lysis Buffer (+PI).\nScrape cells in the Lysis Buffer using a cell scraper. Transfer to an ice-cold 15 mL conical tube (expected volume is ∼3 mL: 2.5 mL of lysis buffer + cells + residual PBS).\nLyse cells in the other two 15 cm dishes. Collect all lysates in the same 15 mL tube to obtain the total volume of ∼ 9 mL (∼3 mL per dish).\nRemove PBS from the 6 “soaked” microcentrifuge tubes. Using a serological pipette, gently mix the ∼9 mL cell lysate 20 times and transfer to the 6 microcentrifuge tubes, ∼1.5 mL per tube.",
    "Note: Depending on the duration of infection and the cell type used, cells may die and/or detach from the dishes (for example, SARS-CoV-2 infected HEK293T cells at 24 hpi). To include floating cells in the experiment, do not discard the media in step 1b, but instead, collect it in a conical tube and spin down at 1,000 × g 4°C for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and wash the cell pellet once with ice-cold 1× PBS. Resuspend the cell pellet in the Lysis Buffer that was used to scrape cells from the dishes.\nCritical: Do not use trypsin to detach cells from dishes. Trypsin remnants can interfere with mass spectrometry analysis.\nNucleic acid degradation.\nAdd 1 μL of Benzonase to each of the 6 microcentrifuge tubes containing 1.5 mL of cell lysates.\nIncubate tubes on ice for 15 min. Invert tubes every 5 min. Spin down in a pre-cooled swinging-bucket centrifuge for 22 min at maximum speed (4,750 rpm, 4°C) to remove cell debris.\nRemove tubes from the centrifuge and keep them on ice while preparing beads and antibodies for the immunoprecipitation step.\nImmuno-precipitating HLA-I complexes from cell lysates\nTiming: 3.5 h (in BSL3)\nThe steps below describe the immunoprecipitation of the HLA-peptide complex from infected cell lysates using a pan-HLA-I antibody. Our assays showed that during the 3 h immunoprecipitation step, SARS-CoV-2 is completely inactivated by 1.5% Triton-X and Benzonase present in the lysis buffer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2246-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Plaque assay confirming SARS-CoV-2 inactivation after 3 h incubation with lysis buffer containing Triton-X- and benzonase",
    "A549 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI of 3 for 24 h. 10-fold serial dilutions were prepared in Opti-MEM and used to infect Vero cells in a 24-well plate. Comparing plaques in (left) cultured media of infected A549 cells; (middle) SARS-CoV-2 infected A549 cells treated with a lysis buffer containing 1.5% Triton-X and Benzonase for 3 h; and (right) non-infected A549 cells. When adding the 1:10 dilution of the lysis buffer, infected and non-infected cells died immediately due to the relatively high Triton-X concentration. Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] was adapted from Figure S1 in Weingarten-Gabbay et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nPreparation of antibody-bead mixture.\nCentrifuge the microcentrifuge tubes containing washed beads prepared in step 12f of the “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]” section at 4,000 rpm for 1 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant without disturbing the beads.\nAdd 50 μL of W6/32 pan-HLA-A/B/C antibody to each tube.\nIncubation of lysates with beads for immunoprecipitation.\nTransfer clear lysates from step 2c to microcentrifuge tubes containing beads and antibodies using a p1000 pipette. When transferring lysates, avoid cell debris at the bottom of the tubes.\nIncubate the tubes on a rotisserie-style rotator in a 4°C mini fridge for 3 h. After 3 h, the virus is inactivated, and the immunoprecipitated complexes are safe to be removed from BSL3.\nCritical: At the end of this step, both SARS-CoV-2 and VSV were found to be completely inactivated when tested by the standard plaque assay. When working with a new enveloped virus, inactivation should be confirmed before removing samples from BSL3 (or other specified containment level) for the remaining steps of the protocol.\nNote: When transferring the IP tubes from BSL3 to BSL1, use an ice bucket or a pre-chilled cold block at 4°C.\nWashing beads after HLA-I immunoprecipitation\nTiming: 2 h (in BSL1)",
    "After immunoprecipitation is complete, beads are thoroughly washed to remove unbound proteins and antibodies, as well as enzymes, detergents and salts contained in the lysis buffer. Buffers are gradually exchanged during the course of 9 washing steps until the lysis buffer is replaced with Tris 20 mM. At the end of these steps, samples are ready for peptide elution and mass spectrometry analysis.\nNote: All wash steps were done using vacuum pipette (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Centrifugation was performed at 2,500 rcf for 1 min at 4°C.\nNote: All wash buffers should be ice-cold.\nWashing beads once with Lysis Wash Buffer.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2246-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Representative images depicting vacuum setup for bead washing and drying\n(Left) For the bead washing setup, an unfiltered 20 μL pipette tip was attached to a suction tube. (Right) For the bead drying setup, a 0.5 μL–10 μL gel loading pipet tip (See key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) was attached to the unfiltered 20 μL pipette tip.\nSpin down beads for 1 min, 2,500 rcf at 4°C.\nAspirate supernatant using vacuum pipette. Do not disturb the bead pellet.\nAdd 1 mL of Lysis Wash Buffer.\nVortex for 10 s and repeat centrifugation.\nOptional: Unbound cell lysates can be used for whole proteome analysis of infected cells. In that case, instead of aspirating lysates, transfer them to 6 labeled ice-cold microcentrifuge tubes using a p1000 pipette and store at −80°C.\nWashing beads 4 times with Complete Wash Buffer.\nAspirate the supernatant. Do not disturb the bead pellet.\nAdd 1 mL of Complete Wash Buffer.\nVortex for 10 s and repeat centrifugation.\nWashing beads 4 times with 20 mM Tris Buffer.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nAdd 1 mL of 20 mM Tris Buffer.\nVortex for 10 s and repeat centrifugation.\nDrying beads.",
    "Upon completion of final wash, aspirate supernatant using vacuum pipette without disturbing the beads pellet.\nRemove the residual volume of the buffer using gel loading tips (Refer to key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]). Beads will transform from translucent to white and should appear like salt crystals.\nStore the dry beads at −80°C.\nNote: When drying the pellet, the skinny tips can touch the beads to adequately dry the beads.\nNote: HLA-I peptide complexes are stable at −80°C for 3–6 months.\nPurifying peptides from beads for mass spectrometry analysis\nTiming: 1–2 h (in BSL1)\nPeptides are eluted from dry beads using 50 mg tC18 Sep-Pak cartridge and a vacuum manifold (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). At the end of these steps, samples are ready for mass spectrometry analysis.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2246-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Repeat this step two more times.",
    "Wash the cartridge with 500 μL 1% FA four times.\nEluting peptides from cartridge to a new collection tube.\nPlace a new 2 mL Eppendorf collection tube.\nRinse cartridge with 250 μL 15% ACN/1% FA once (Elution 1).\nRinse cartridge with 250 μL 50% ACN/1% FA two times (Elution 2).\nDry eluted peptides using SpeedVac and store at −80°C until mass spectrometry analysis.\nResuspend peptides in 5 μL 3% ACN/5% FA and inject 4 μL onto mass spectrometer."
