    "Ex vivo tetramer labeling of CD4+ T cells from HIV infected patientsPBMC from HIV infected samples are either thawed from frozen vials or freshly processed from whole blood in a biosafety level-3 environment.15-50 x 106 cells are dispatched into 5 ml polypropylene tubes (5 x 106 cells per tube) and washed once with 2 ml complete RPMI at 600 x g for 7 min at 4 °C.Notes:  A wash entails the addition of the indicated volume of the specified washing buffer followed by centrifugation and careful removal of the supernatant.A minimum of 5 x 106 PBMC is required per tetramer labeling; the same number of PBMC is required for the control tetramer labeling. When scaling up, it is preferable to process multiple identical sample tubes in parallel, so that the amount of cells required for the control tube remains constant at 5 x 106 PBMC.Individual tubes containing 0.5 x 106 cells in 50 μl FACS buffer should be prepared at this stage to be used as single stained compensation controls. These tubes should be kept at 4 °C for the duration of the tetramer labeling until the point of addition of cell surface antibodies.Supernatants are removed and the cell pellets are re-suspended in 100 μl pre-chilled tetramer labeling buffer and placed on ice.Solutions of MHC II tetramers loaded with either a validated HIV-1 peptide, or an irrelevant control peptide (CLIP) are spun at full speed for 5 min at 4 °C to remove protein aggregates.Note: Spinning the MHC II tetramer solution before usage reduces background labeling.APC-conjugated tetramers are added to the cell suspension at 1 μg per 106 cells (i.e., 5 µg per tube).",
    "Important: One tube containing 5 x 106 cells has to be labeled with tetramers loaded with an irrelevant peptide (CLIP) and used as a negative control for tetramer labeling.Tetramer labeling is performed at 0-4 °C for 60 min, protected from light.Note: Staining under cold conditions contributes to reduction of background; however, these conditions are appropriate only for the detection of high-avidity pMHC/TCR interactions.A mixture of antibodies targeting cell surface markers is added to each tube as follows (v/106 cells): 1 μl CD3 APC-eFluor 780; 0.5 μl CD4 PE-CF594; 0.5 μl CD8 BV 785; 3 μl CD14-VioGreen; 3 μl CD20-VioGreen and 0.5 μl Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 506.Notes:  Additional antibodies for cell surface phenotyping can be added at this point.At this point, tubes containing 0.5 x 106 cells in 50 μl FACS buffer are singly labeled with individual antibodies to be used as compensation controls. For the AmCyan-dump channel (including CD14-VioGreen; CD20-VioGreen and Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 506), a single tube containing 0.5 x 106 cells in 50 μl FACS buffer is labeled with 1.5 μl CD14-VioGreen.Cells are further incubated with the antibody mixture for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark.For flow cytometric analysisLabeled cells are washed twice with (pre-chilled) FACS buffer and fixed with 2% PFA diluted in PBS.Note: Fixation entails complete removal of the supernatants following centrifugation and resuspension in 400 µl of the fixation solution.All cells in the tube are acquired on a flow cytometer (LSR Fortessa).For cell sortingLabeled cells are washed once with FACS sorting buffer and the cell concentration is adjusted to 10 x 106 cells per ml in FACS sorting buffer.Cells are filtered using a Cell-Strainer cap to obtain a single-cell suspension. Subsequently, all cells are acquired on a cell sorter (FACSAria II) installed in a microbiological safety cabinet.",
