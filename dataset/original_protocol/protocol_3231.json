Take out 200 μL of the colonies medium that appear cloudy separately and send them directly to the company without any processing for Sanger sequencing.\nFor Sanger sequencing, use the sequence of the backbone vector which is near the ligation site (here we used 5′-TAGTGAACCGTCAGATCGCCTG-3′ sequence) to verify the existence of FLAG-MyoD1 fragment. Once the FLAG-MyoD1 sequence is available, the colony is identified as the positive.\nExpand the positive colony in 25 mL of LB medium supplied with 100 μg/mL Ampicillin to isolate viral vector DNA.",

    "Critical: The configure file contains these parameters including bing size, q-value and the loop size. For checking the quality of BL-HiChIP data, we also did ChIP-Seq from the same cells and analyzed the overlap between peaks (from ChIP-Seq) and anchors of high-confidence interactions (from BL-HiChIP). The results showed that 79.8% (4786/5993) of anchors overlapped with ChIP peaks (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). The result is consistent with regular HiChIP data.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] In addition, we also compared the tagged MyoD BL-HiChIP with Hi-C data from mouse primary myoblasts (Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO): GSE157339).9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] The results showed that 93.8% (3932/4192) of MyoD loops exist in the HiC loops (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B) confirmed that the HiChIP data are reliable."
