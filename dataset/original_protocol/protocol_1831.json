The required extinction coefficient value and the molecular weight of the protein are obtained from ProtParam tool (ExPASy) and used to calculate the concentration.\nStore the protein aliquots at −80°C after flash freezing with liquid nitrogen.\nCrystallization of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro\nTiming: 3 days\nCrystallize Mpro for structural data collection.\nThe crystallization screening is performed by using commercially available crystallization screen kits.\nNote: The protocol for each screen can be reached at https://kuybim.ku.edu.tr/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Crystallization-screens.pdf[href=https://kuybim.ku.edu.tr/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Crystallization-screens.pdf]\nSitting drop, microbatch screening (under oil), performed by mixing the protein and crystallization screens at a 1:1 ratio, is used for crystallization.\nNote: Sitting drop, microbatch screening (under oil) is a cheap and robust method. However, as an alternative method for crystallization, hanging drop vapor diffusion can be applied instead of sitting drop for proper crystal growth without a direct contact with the edges of well and easy crystal harvest.\nThaw the protein samples, which are stored at −80°C, on ice.\nPrepare all required materials and tools while the protein samples are thawing (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1424-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "Use the peakfinder8 algorithm in Cheetah to determine the hit finding parameters. Consider a minimum pixel count above 2 and adc-threshold of 500 with a minimum signal to noise ratio of 7 as a peak. Classify an image with a minimum of 20 peaks as a crystal hit.\nGenerate the small data providing each event including hits, resolution.\nThe hits were calibrated (detector gain threshold applied) and converted to HDF5 file format using Cheetah, including entries for the image data, instrument data and event codes.\nObservable hot pixels and bad detector areas (such as the panel edges) were masked out during peak finding by applying a mask in HDF5 format (consisting of zeros and ones, which gets multiplied with the image data).\nCritical: Accurate peak positions are required for correct indexing and reflection intensity determination of the diffraction pattern, hence it is critical to complete this step meticulously.\nOptimize the detector geometry by updating the mask as well as optimizing the mapping of the detector panels to the lab frame. The latter can be done using geoptimiser, which is included in the CrystFEL package up to version 0. 9.1. Troubleshooting 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nDo CrystFEL indexing of the diffraction patterns applying the correct unit cell and Bravais lattice type once these have been successfully determined.\nCritical: Once a correct indexing solution has been found, the predicted Bragg reflection positions can be displayed overlaid onto the image. For an indexing solution to be correct, it is important for any observed peaks to align with these predictions.",
    "Critical: For accurate intensity determination of the individual reflections, the integration rings should be adjusted for optimal local background subtraction. In detail, the narrowest integration radius should be set to the size of the broadest peak observed and the middle and widest integration radii set an annulus between which the local background contribution to the respective reflection is estimated and subsequently subtracted.\nObtain CrystFEL stream file that contains a list of intensity values for every reflection predicted by the indexing solution in every indexable pattern.\nReiterate through the detector geometry optimization, adjusting the panel positions relative to the beam ensuring the most accurate indexing results.\nCritical: Detector geometry correction is exceedingly important for SFX experiments. Normally, the same geometry files from the previous experiment are used. However, detector geometry optimization is inevitable when the interaction point or the detector motor position has changed.\nIndex the hits by using CrystFEL version 0.9.0. CrystFEL (Github Repository: https://github.com/taw10/crystfel[href=https://github.com/taw10/crystfel]) is a free and open-source software package to process the data from serial crystallography (SX) experiments characterized by XFEL and with other X-ray sources.

These can be minimized through iterative refinement of the residue and surrounding residues.\nAfter the coot refinement is finished, click File -> Save Coordinates to save the resultant structure.\nUse the model structure's coordinates for initial rigid-body refinement executing the phenix.refinecommand with the parameters given below using this new PDB file and the .mtz file in “Terminal” of macOS or Linux:",

All parameters can be changed according to the data of the relevant structure\nNote: Do not forget to open the required file with this .pdb and .mtz files in Terminal by command of “% cd”.\nRepeat steps 133–136 to iteratively improve your structure. Ideally, an appropriate structure has a minimum number of ramachandran outliers with r-free and r-work values less than 2, if not then less than 3. Troubleshooting 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nWhen you are satisfied with your structure, open the structure and map in coot again, Check the individual water molecules in the Coot program and retain positions with strong differential density. Those which do not, can be deleted by selecting ‘Delete Item…’ in the right action bar, selecting ‘Water’ in the pop-up, and clicking on the desired water molecule. Troubleshooting 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nStrong empty differential densities can be filled with water by selecting ‘Place Atom At Pointer…’ in the right action bar, selecting ‘Water’ in the pop-up, and selecting ‘OK’.\nCritical: Standardl, adding water molecules should be the last step of structure refinement, only after the protein model has been fully refined.\nUpload the final PDBx/mmCIF format to the PDB database.\nBefore submission, convert the coordinate file to mmCIF format using this link: https://pdb-extract.wwpdb.org/[href=https://pdb-extract.wwpdb.org/]\nAfter receiving the mmCIF file, start the PDB submission from the submission page: https://deposit-pdbj.wwpdb.org/deposition/new[href=https://deposit-pdbj.wwpdb.org/deposition/new]\nAfter getting an email about the ID and password, enter the ID and password, and click to start deposition.\nMake sure having all the required files:\n..pdb file\n..mtz file\n..log file\n.map file\n..lp file",
