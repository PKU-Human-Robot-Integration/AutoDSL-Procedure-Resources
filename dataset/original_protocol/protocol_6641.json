    "Order the DNA oligonucleotide with the appropriate modificationsOrder your DNA oligonucleotide with sequence of interest (Note 1). The 3′-most nucleotide should be modified to be a ribonucleotide. The penultimate nucleotide (immediately 5′ to the ribonucleotide) should be modified to be a 2′-O-methylribonucleotide. To specify these modifications in the IDT ordering interface, begin with an order for an RNA oligonucleotide at 100 nmol scale. If the sequence of your DNA oligonucleotide is NNNNNN-3′, your sequence input should be NNNNmNrN.In the example presented in this protocol, the DNA oligonucleotide sequence is:5′-GTCATAATGATTTTATCTTCTGGATTGTTGTAAGCAGCATTTGAGCAAAAATCTGTTmGrC-3′, where all letters indicate deoxynucleotides except “mG” (which indicates 2′-O-methylguanosine) and “rC” (which indicates cytidine).Resuspend the DNA oligonucleotide to 10 µM in water (Note 2).Order or transcribe the phosphate shuttle RNA oligonucleotide and the splint RNA oligonucleotideThe phosphate shuttle RNA oligonucleotide can be ordered from an oligonucleotide synthesis company or produced by in vitro transcription. If producing by in vitro transcription (Notes 3 and 4), use a method whose final product contains a 5′-OH (either by treating a T7 RNA polymerase product with phosphatase or including a self-cleaving hammerhead ribozyme in the transcript). It is essential that the phosphate shuttle RNA contain a 5′-OH for the 5′-radiolabeling step.Phosphate shuttle RNA oligonucleotide sequence (Note 5):5′-GGGUCGGCAUGGCAUCUC-3′We include below the sequence of an in vitro transcription DNA template for T7 RNA polymerase to generate the phosphate shuttle RNA oligonucleotide (Note 6). Transcripts from this template contain a 5′ hammerhead ribozyme that cleaves to yield a 5′-OH on the final phosphate shuttle oligonucleotide.5′-GTCGAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGCGACCCCTGATGAGGCCTTCGGGCCGAAACGGTGAAAGCCGTAGGGTCGGCATGGCATCTC-3′The 5′ half of the splint RNA oligonucleotide should be complementary to the phosphate shuttle RNA oligonucleotide. The 3′ half of the splint RNA oligonucleotide should be complementary to the 3′ end of the DNA oligonucleotide to be labeled.",
    "The splint RNA oligonucleotide can be ordered from an oligonucleotide synthesis company or produced by in vitro transcription. The substituents on either end of this oligonucleotide are unimportant, as the ligase enzyme will bind to its center.Sequence of splint RNA oligonucleotide in this example:5′-GGAGAUGCCAUGCCGACCCGCAACAGAUUUUUGCUCA-3′We include below the sequence of an in vitro transcription DNA template for T7 RNA polymerase to generate the splint RNA oligonucleotide:5′-GTCGAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGAGATGCCATGCCGACCCGCAACAGATTTTTGCTCA-3′Resuspend each RNA oligonucleotide to 10 µM in RNA storage buffer.5′-radiolabel the phosphate shuttle RNA oligonucleotideCombine the following reagents (50 µl total reaction volume) (Note 7):5 µl 10x T4 PNK buffer30 µl water5 µl phosphate shuttle RNA oligonucleotide (10 µM stock)2.5 µl T4 PNK enzyme (10,000 U/ml stock)7.5 µl [γ-32P]-ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml stock)Allow phosphorylation to progress at 37 °C for 2 h.Heat-inactivate the T4 PNK by incubating at 65 °C for 20 min.Add 50 µl water to the reaction.If interested in determining yield, use the benchtop radiation counter to measure the radioactivity in the reaction at this step.Spin the reaction through a MicroSpin G-25 column (no resin pre-equilibration necessary), following the manufacturer’s instructions. This step largely removes any free [γ-32P]-ATP that may remain after the reaction.Assuming complete recovery of the RNA oligonucleotide, you should have 100 µl of eluate containing 500 nM RNA oligonucleotide, some fraction of which has a 5′-32P-phosphate. Use the benchtop radiation counter to measure the radioactivity in the eluate, and determine the efficiency of 5′-radiolabeling by comparing to the radioactivity measurement recorded before free ATP removal.Anneal ligase substratesFor each DNA oligonucleotide to be 3′-radiolabeled, combine the following (33 µl total reaction volume):6.6 µl 5x annealing buffer0.3 µl water24 µl 5′-radiolabeled phosphate shuttle RNA oligonucleotide (500 nM stock, directly from eluate in previous step)1 µl modified DNA oligonucleotide (10 µM stock)1.",
    "1 µl splint RNA oligonucleotide (10 µM stock)Place the annealing reaction on a thermocycler, and run the following temperature program (Note 8):95 °C, 2 min.Cool to 25 °C over the course of 40 min.Hold at 25 °C.Ligate the DNA oligonucleotide to the phosphate shuttle RNA oligonucleotidTo the 33-µl annealing reaction, add:4 µl 10x T4 RNA ligase 2 reaction buffer1 µl 40 mM MgCl22 µl T4 RNA ligase 2 (10,000 U/ml stock)Incubate at 37 °C overnight (~16 h). If performing quality control, keep a sample from immediately after this incubation to run on a gel and determine ligation efficiency (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201013/20201013003752_2532.jpgFigure 3. Example autoradiograph of denaturing PAGE analysis. Lane 1: products of ligation reaction, standard protocol. Lane 2: products of ligation reaction using a DNA oligonucleotide that omits the 2′-O-methyl modification at the penultimate position (but retains the ribonucleotide modification at the final position), demonstrating the importance of the 2′-O-methyl modification for ligation efficiency. Lanes 3-7: products after RNA degradation of the ligation products in lane 1 with [NaOH] at 20 mM (lane 3), 50 mM (lane 4), 100 mM (lane 5), 150 mM (lane 6), and 200 mM (lane 7). The band in lane 6 represents the product generated by the conditions recommended in this protocol.Degrade RNATo the 40-µl ligation reaction, add 5 µl 1.35 M NaOH. Mix thoroughly.Incubate at 95 °C for 10 min.Place on ice, and immediately add 5 µl 1.35 M HCl. Mix thoroughly.Remove salts and mononucleotides by buffer exchangePre-equilibrate a MicroSpin G-25 column with 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.9 (room temperature) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (5 x 400-µl equilibration spins).Apply the 50-µl degradation reaction to the column, and spin according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Add 50 µl water to the eluate.",
    "At this point, the sample should have 100 µl total volume, containing 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.9 and 100 nM 3′-radiolabeled DNA oligonucleotide (as well as the heat-inactivated kinase and ligase enzymes).Yield and quality checkUse the benchtop radiation counter to check the yield of transfer of radioactivity from the phosphate shuttle RNA oligonucleotide to the final DNA oligonucleotide. We commonly see recovery of ~75% of transferable phosphates (Note 9).Run a sample of the labeled DNA oligonucleotide on denaturing PAGE to verify that the sample contains a pure radiolabeled DNA fragment of the correct size (Notes 10 and 11, Figure 3).Store the radiolabeled DNA at -20 °C. The limiting factor for the expiration of the radiolabeled oligonucleotide is the radioactivity, as the chemical stability of the product (> years) long outlasts the radioactive decay lifetime of 32P (half-life 14 days). The product can continue to be used as long as it retains enough radioactivity for the researcher’s particular experimental purposes."
