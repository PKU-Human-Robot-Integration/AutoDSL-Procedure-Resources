    "1. Hydrophobization of Magnetic Nanoparticles\nFor the synthesis of the hydrophobic magnetic particles, add 0.85 g FeCl3 hexahydrate (3.14 mmol) and 0.30 g FeCl2 tetrahydrate (1.51 mmol) to 200 mL water/ethanol solution (4:1 v/v).\nTo this mixture, add 0.20 mL 1H,1H,2H,2H-Perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane (PFOTES) (5.23 mmol) with vigorous stirring by a magnetic stirrer (500 rpm). Carry out the synthesis in an inert gas atmosphere (N2) by using a round-bottom flask with a cork in order to prevent the secondary oxidation of the magnetite particles.\nAdjust the solution drop wise with an ammonium hydroxide solution (1.5 M) to a pH of 8 (pH determined by a pH meter). Stir the solution for 24 h by using a magnetic stirrer.\nSeparate the particles magnetically from the solution by placing the flask on a bar magnet (neodymium cuboid magnet 40 x 20 x 10 mm, adhesive force 25 kg). Pour out the solution while keeping the magnet attached to the bottom of the flask.\nWash the particles three times with the water/ethanol solution while using a bar magnet as described in 1.4). Dry the particles at 60 °C for 24 h (yield ca. 0.43 g).\nFor analyzing the particles, use a Scanning Electron Microscope according to manufacturer's instructions.\n2. Fabrication of Microreactors\nGrind all the dried particles slightly using a glass pestle and subsequently place all of them directly in a weighing pan (46 × 46 × 8 mm, polystyrene).\nPipette 10 µL reaction solution (composition as described in 5.1) onto all the particles and move the weighing pan slightly in a circular way for approximately 10 s (particle mass for a 10 µL microreactor: ca. 3.2 x 10-7 kg 33). Store the remaining particles (particles which did not self-assemble around the reaction solution) at room temperature for further applications.",
    "For measuring the contact angle of the microreactor, build a 5 µL microreactor with water as described in 2.2), place it on a teflon film and analyze the contact angle by using an optical contact angle measurement device according to manufacturer's instructions.\n3. 3D-printing of the Coil Bodies\nDesign the double coil bodies with a height of 16 mm (one chamber), a diameter of 10 mm and an inner diameter of ca. 4 mm by using a CAD software according to manufacturer's instructions.\nPrint the coil bodies with a 3D printer according to the manufacturer's instructions by using materials such as polylactide filament. Wrap the bodies with a 0.08 mm copper wire to achieve 4,500 windings by using a computer controlled winding machine.\n4. Fabrication of the Actuation Platform\nArrange the double coils in a matrix (e.g. 3 x 3 matrix) on an electric board with a Peltier element underneath, screw on the double coils and connect them to a control via ribbon cable (Figure 3).\nDepending on the desired application, add an iron core (32 mm height, 4 mm diameter) or a neodymium magnet (12.5 mm height, 4 mm diameter, 1,035 kA m-1) to the coil body to gain a stronger magnetic field.\nTo finish the platform place a plate, preferably quartz glass, with a maximum height of 1 mm on the coil matrix.\nPlace a microreactor on the surface of the platform.\nTo withdraw the upper particles from the reaction solution and thereby open a microreactor activate a coil with a neodymium magnet inside by using the control mentioned in 4.1). To close the microreactor again deactivate the coil.",
    "To merge two microreactors which are initially ca. 10 mm apart use neodymium magnets as described in 4.2). Lift up the magnet in the required coil bodies by activating the coils for ca. 25 s to open one microreactor (required distance between microreactor and magnet lies about 12 mm) and to move the other one to the same position on the platform.\nTo cool down the reaction solution in the microreactor on the platform surface and to decrease the coil temperature switch on the Peltier element positioned beneath the coil matrix as described in 4.1).\n5. Enzymatic Reaction by Merging Microreactors\nDissolve horseradish peroxidase at a concentration of 0.1 µg mL-1 in potassium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 6.5). Dilute the substrate, 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine (10 mM in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)) with potassium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 6.5) to a concentration of 200 µM.\nUse 10 µL of each of these solutions to build two microreactors as described in 2.2). Merge the two microreactors by the mean of magnetic forces (neodymium cylinder magnet: 12.5 mm x 4 mm, 1,035 kA m-1) as described in 4.6) at 25 °C.\nDetect the reaction by positioning a fluorescence probe (excitation wavelength: 570 nm, emission wavelength: 585 nm) ca. 10 mm directly above an opened microreactor before the merge.\nSubscription Required.
