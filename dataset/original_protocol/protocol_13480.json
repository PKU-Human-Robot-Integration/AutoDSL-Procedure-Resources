    "This research was performed in compliance with the institutional guidelines of the University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center, approval number STU-2021-1166. Data were collected retrospectively through chart review, and thus the need for patient consent was waived.\n1. User workflow analysis\nDuring the user workflow analysis, use contextual inquiry to identify the key procedural steps and identify the personnel responsible for documenting these steps. Identify the EHR data structures that represent them, and map these data structures to tables in the EHR's reporting database.\n\t​NOTE: Contextual inquiry is a method combining real-time field observations with the interactive probing of workers during work activities14,15.\nIdentification of key procedural events and the personnel responsible for documentation\n\t\nObserve and interview faculty and trainee physicians, circulating and scrub staff, anesthesiology staff, and device representatives to develop a process map of the key procedural events required for tracking performance.\nNote the following key procedural events: patient arrival time, the time out procedure, vascular access attainment, sheath insertion and removal, esophageal cooling device or temperature probe insertion and removal, vascular closure, patient emergence, and patient departure time.\n2. Observation of placement and use of an esophageal cooling device\nNOTE: The placement and use of the active esophageal cooling device have been previously demonstrated and can be seen in Zagrodzky et al.10.\nIn brief, first connect the esophageal cooling device to the external heat exchanger. Turn on the power and activate the water flow to provide adequate device stiffness and ensure the absence of any leaks. Apply a generous amount of lubrication to the distal 15 cm and place the device in a similar fashion to a standard orogastric tube.",
    "Determine proper esophageal cooling device placement using standard fluoroscopy demonstrating the device tip below the patient's diaphragm; if zero-fluoroscopy techniques are used, visualize the device on intracardiac echocardiography. \n\t\nIf using fluoroscopy, use standard settings as chosen by the lab with an anterior-posterior view, and center the image at the patient's xiphoid.\nIf using intracardiac echocardiography, rotate the catheter to obtain a posterior view to allow for visualization of the device in the esophagus, posterior to the left atrium. \n3. Structured data extraction\nIdentification of the data elements representing procedural events: after identification of the users responsible for procedural documentation (i.e., circulating or documenting nurse), which may be facility-specific, identify and record the documentation workflows and data elements representing the procedural activities described in step 1.2. Data elements in this step include correlating the sheath insertion to the EHR flowsheet elements representing this data point.\nMap and extract the data elements to database structures for bulk reporting: after identification of the data structures representing the key procedural steps, use EHR database mapping tools to translate these structures from the operational data structures to relational database tables in the reporting database. Extract the data into a tabular format for integration with the results of the manual chart review.\n4. Identification of data necessitating manual extraction\nIdentify any necessary data that cannot be easily extracted via database structures.\nFor this protocol, perform manual extraction for the following data elements: energy used in ablation; esophageal protection method used, type of atrial fibrillation, episode of postoperative pain during admission, episode of postoperative pain following discharge (within 30 days).\n5. Manual data extraction\nCreate a REDCap database instrument to facilitate manual chart review16,17. The extracted data are shown in Supplementary File 1 (REDCap data storage extraction form).",
    "Create a new project within REDCap by clicking the New Project button. After naming the project, this will lead to a page titled: Project Setup. Navigate to the second section titled: Design your data collection instruments and click the Online Designer button.\nIn the online designer, click Create a new instrument from scratch. In the instrument, add all the fields listed in step 4.2, in addition to a patient medical record number in order to correlate the manual data collected, to the data that was collected via EHR database structure extraction.\nOnce the instrument is finalized, click the Move project to production button. From the left panel, click Add / Edit Records to view the finalized data instruments for inputting the data during the chart review.\nIdentify patients that fit within the study inclusion criteria, in this case, all patients that received ablations for AF between January 2020 and January 2022.\nPerform a manual chart review of the included patients, adding the data collected into the project created in REDCap for future analysis."
