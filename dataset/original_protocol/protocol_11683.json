    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) for Texas A&M University College of Dentistry.\n1. Preparation of the EdU labeling cocktail\nPrepare the cocktail stock solutions as described in Table 1.\nPrepare the EdU labeling cocktail as described in Table 1.\n2. Preparation of the mice and EdU solution\nPrepare the EdU solution. Dissolve EdU in DMSO at 20 mg/mL and store in a -20 °C freezer.\n\tCAUTION: EdU is a mutagen. Users should wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling this substance.\nInject 5-day-old C57BL/6J mice with the prepared EdU solution intraperitoneally at 3 µL/g body weight. Mice must receive the solution once a day for 7 consecutive days. Next, they undergo a chase period for 6 weeks before being harvested for analysis (Figure 1).\n\t​CAUTION: Be careful to avoid needle pricking when injecting EdU into the mice. After injecting EdU for 7 consecutive days, place the mice in a new cage. After the mice are in their new home, dispose of the bedding in the old cage using appropriate biohazard rules.\n3. Sample preparation by trans-cardiac perfusion (postnatal 53-day-old mice after the 6-week chase period)\nNOTE: The mouse liver should turn pale after successful trans-cardiac perfusion.\nAnesthetize mice with an intraperitoneal injection. They need to be given a combination of xylazine and ketamine anesthetics (Xylazine 10-12.5 mg/kg; Ketamine, 80-100 mg/kg body weight).\nWait for ~10 min until the mouse no longer responds to painful stimuli (such as paw pinch reflexes).\nPlace the mice in a supine position stabilized on Styrofoam support with needles in each paw.\nExpose the chest cavity by opening up the overlying skin using tweezers and dissecting scissors.\nCut open the diaphragm using sharp scissors. Take care not to pierce the heart.",
    "Cut through the ribcage, grabbing the base of the sternum with clamp scissors to expose the heart.\nTransfer the mouse to the perfusion stage near the circulation pump in a fume hood.\nInsert the 25 G needle (from the tubing filled with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution) into the apex of the left ventricle. Take care to keep the tip of the needle in the lumen of the ventricle.\n\tCAUTION: PFA is moderately toxic and a probable carcinogen. Use PPE to handle PFA and prepare the solution under a chemical fume hood. Waste PFA requires proper disposal per institution guidelines.\nCut the right ventricle using a sharp scissor immediately after inserting the needle into the left ventricle. This step allows for blood to flow out of the mouse and drain into the collecting dish.\nPerfuse the samples with 50 mL of PBS solution at a flow rate of 7 mL/min.\nAfter PBS perfusion, switch the stopcock to allow for a flow of 20 mL of 4% PFA solution at the same flow rate of 5 mL/min.\nWhile the circulation pump is still on, remove the needle from the left ventricle.\n\t​NOTE: The mouse is now fixed for tissue collection. To preserve the fluorescence, light exposure should be avoided whenever possible throughout the entire protocol. While the tissue is processing, the 50 mL conical tube with the tissue samples may be covered with aluminum foil.\n4. Tissue clearing of the mandible using the PEGASOS technique",
    "NOTE: A 15 mL or 50 mL conical tube as per the volume of tissues can be used to keep the samples ready for treatment in each step. Samples are processed at 37 °C shakers (~100 rpm) from steps 4.2 to 4.7. Use polypropylene-based plastic containers that are resistant to organic solvents to avoid melting the plastic. Alternatively, glassware can be used.\nCAUTION: The PEGASOS tissue clearing technique uses toxic solutions such as Quadrol, polyethylene glycol (PEG), benzyl benzoate (BB), MMA500, etc. Appropriate PPE is required to avoid potential exposures.\nDissect mandibles and further fix samples in 4% PFA. Keep them at room temperature overnight.\nRemove the muscles from the mandibles and immerse them in 0.5 M EDTA solution (pH 8.0) to decalcify for 4 days. During this period, perform a daily medium change on a 37 °C shaker.\n\tNOTE: It is desirable to remove the muscles from the sample as much as possible. This precaution will simplify the imaging process and reduce the autofluorescence from the muscles.\nDecolorize the mandibles with a 25% Quadrol solution (v/v in H2O) on a 37 °C shaker for one day to remove the remaining blood heme.\nComplete whole mount EdU staining.\n\t\nPrepare a fresh EdU labeling cocktail according to Table 1.\n\t\tNOTE: The EdU labeling cocktail needs to be made fresh each time with freshly prepared ascorbate solution added for obtaining optimum EdU labeling results.\nRinse the mandibles with PBST for 30 min on a 37 °C shaker.\nRinse the mandibles with PBS three times for 3 min each time.\nIncubate the mandibles in a freshly made EdU labeling cocktail on a 37 °C shaker overnight.\nRinse the mandibles with PBS three times for 3 min each time.\nPerform serial de-lipidation in each of the following solutions for 6 h on 37 °C:",
    "30% tert-butanol (tB) solution: 75% v/v H2O, 22% v/v tB, and 3% v/v Quadrol.\n\t50% tB solution: 50% v/v H2O, 47% v/v tB, and 3% v/v Quadrol.\n\t70% tB solution: 30% v/v H2O, 67% v/v tB, and 3% v/v Quadrol\n\tNOTE: The de-lipidation step is critical. De-lipidation can be done between 4-6 h in 30% and 50% tB solution and for 1 day in 70% tB solution.\nDehydrate the mandibles in tB-PEG solution for 2 days with the following daily medium change: 75% tB, 22% v/v polyethylene glycol methyl-ether methacrylate average MMA500, and 3% v/v Quadrol at 37 °C.\nClear the mandible in benzyl benzoate (BB)-PEG clearing medium to obtain refractive index matching: 75% v/v BB, 22% v/v PEG-MMA500, and 3% Quadrol until transparency is achieved.\n\tNOTE: We have information on refractive index matching. The inorganic and organic components in tissues such as water, lipids, proteins, minerals, organelles, etc. have a different refractive index (RI) in the range of 1.33 to 1.55. This RI mismatch between the tissue components hinders the imaging process. Transparency can be achieved by eliminating RI mismatch within the tissue. Immersing the tissue-cleared samples in the clearing medium of BB-PEG is advised. This step will give the uniform internal RI of ~1.54 (called RI matching) to the whole specimen, easing the imaging process.\nPreserve the mandibles in the BB-PEG tissue clearing medium at room temperature for storage and imaging.\n\t​NOTE: It is good to complete the imaging as soon as possible to avoid the gradual loss of fluorescent reporters. However, the PEGASOS method will keep fluorescence reporters well preserved even after several weeks of storage20,21. For long-term storage, the samples can also be stored at 4°C.\n5. Confocal imaging of the tissue-cleared mandible",
    "Mount the tissue cleared whole mandible on brand cavity slides in the BB-PEG clearing medium and cover with glass cover slides. Avoid any bubbles.\nPerform image acquisition with a suitable laser scanning confocal microscope. Select Acquire and set the image acquisition parameters at 512 x 512 pixel resolution and 400 Hz acquisition speed. These settings are found in the acquisition mode menu of the software that controls the microscope.\nIn the panel for fluorescent excitation, activate the laser required (TRITC) to optimally excite fluorophores (the probe we used for LRCs visualization has fluorescent properties such as Cy3 with excitation at 548 nm and emission at 563 nm of laser wavelength).\nIn the panel for fluorescent detection, move the slider to select the wavelengths that will be measured (for example, between 555 to 625 nm for a Cy3-like fluorophore).\nPlace the mounted mandible on the microscope stage to visualize and find the sample using white light and a lower magnification objective (2-10x).\nAdd a drop of immersion oil with a refractive index of 1.52 on top of the coverslip to match the refractive index of the glass coverslip and objective.\n\tNOTE: Match the refractive index of objectives, imaging media, and tissue as closely as possible to minimize the introduction of optical distortions during image acquisition.\nTurn on the fluorescent lamps and choose an appropriate magnification objective to image regions of interest. We used a 20x objective lens with a numerical aperture of 0.9 with a working distance of 1.95 mm. A longer working distance lens may be required when imaging larger tissue samples in the confocal microscope. Alternatively, imaging can be done easily using a light-sheet microscope for larger tissue samples.",
    "On the confocal imaging software, press the Live button to start live-scan mode. To maximize the dynamic range of the images and avoid pixel saturation, adjust the gain and laser intensity for the channel selected.\nIdentify the field of view to visualize the entire region of the mandible in the X and Y dimensions. Set the upper and lower Z-stage acquisition parameters that accurately cover the volume of the stem cell niche in the mice incisor. Use a Z-step size of 2 µm or as per your requirements. The newer versions of confocal microscopes should be able to automatically acquire z-stacks of the various overlapping regions.\nAcquire and save Z-stack image files in .lif format.\n\t​NOTE: The .lif flies can be converted into .tiff files and used for other 3D analysis software.\n6. Image processing, 3D image reconstruction, and quantification of label-retaining cells by creating a surface, segmentation of the Region of Interest (ROI), masking the ROI, and creating spots\nNOTE: We used Imaris (Bitplane 9.0.1) for image processing and 3D reconstruction, but similar image processing steps can be conducted using other software suites (e.g., ImageJ/Fiji, 3D slicer, Avizo, Arivis, Amira, etc.).\nIn the imaging software, click the Arena button, then choose Image. Select the original .lif file and choose merged file, the images will be imported into the imaging software.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, use an imaging software file converter to convert Z stack image file to the native format file type for the software. For example: convert the .lif files into .ims files using the Imaris File Converter and open the .ims files in the imaging software. Converting data to the native file format of the software will allow rapid file conversion and minimize errors.\nDouble click the imported file to open the image data set.",
    "Visit the Display Adjustment panel,click the name of the channel. It is usually labeled as Red in default mode.\n\t\nIn the Image Properties window, click on the Mapped Color tab. In the Color Table File option, choose Fire Flow, and then click on OK. The display color is normally chosen to distinguish the background fluorescence and the positive fluorescence from the sample.\nOn the upper left side of the screen in the Scene – Properties pane, click on the blue icon labeled Add New Surface. Unselect the Volume icon which will remove most of the background fluorescence and the positive fluorescence are distinctly visible (see Step 6.4.2).\n\t\nStart the process of manual segmentation of region of interest (ROI) by clicking on the Create tab and selecting the Skip Automatic Creation, Edit Manually tab. In the manual surface creation wizard, click on the Contour tab to choose the orientation (XY, or YZ, or XZ) based on the samples to easily contour the ROI. Here, we choose XY orientation.\nNext, make sure the pointer menu in the right corner is in Select mode. Adjust the Slice Position to locate the ROI in the tissue. You will notice that most of the background fluorescence have been removed with distinct positive fluorescence as mentioned in Step 6.4. Click on the Draw button and draw a tentative region of interest. Select the Visibility option to none to avoid interference from other areas than ROI.\nRepeat step 6.4.2. slice by slice to draw the entire region of interest.\nAfter the ROI drawing is finished, click on Create Surface to get a 3D geometry of the ROI.\nClick on the Edit button in the manual surface creation wizard and select Mask All.",
    "In the popped-out Mask Channel window, select Channel 1 in the channel selection options. Afterward, select Duplicate Channel Before Applying the Mask. In the mask settings, select Constant Inside/Outside and set the voxel outside surface to 0.\nIn the Scene-Properties pane, deselect the Surface Object and select the Volume Object. In the Display Adjustment, deselect the original \"Red” channel and select the Masked Red channel and adjust the color intensities to get the desired 3D-rendered and positively labeled fluorescence ROI.\nCreate a new spot object. Begin by clicking on the Add on Spots icon to quantify the 3D-rendered LRCs by creating 3D spots that comparably overlap with 3D-rendered LRCs. Use the bottom arrows to move between steps in the spot creation wizard.\n\t\nIn the spot creation wizard, there will be four sequential steps of instructions to create spots automatically with the software. Make sure the Segment Only a Region of Interest option is selected in the first step. Click on the Next icon.\nIn the second step, there will be an \"XYZ 3D box\". Adjust the XYZ box to cover the ROI. Click on the Next icon.\nIn the third step, go to the Source Channel options. Choose the masked red channel; input the estimated XY spot diameter comparable to fit and overlap the sample fluorescence dots. Click on the Next icon.\nIn the fourth step, add the \"Quality\" filter type and adjust the lower intensity threshold by moving the sliding window across the 'Quality' histogram until the majority of identifiable LRCs are labeled.\n\t\tNOTE: The segmentation and therefore statistical readouts (example: number of cells) very much depend on the intensity threshold values. Be careful to precisely set the appropriate threshold values.",
    "Click on the Finish button and select the Statistic button. Select the Overall tab to find the value for the total number of spots in the image.\nExport statistics by clicking on the Tab Display to File button and receive the results in an .xls file.\nUse a suitable diagram to present the quantification results.\nSubscription Required.
