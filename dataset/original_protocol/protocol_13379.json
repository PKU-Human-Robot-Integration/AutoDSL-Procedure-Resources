    "All the experimental procedures and protocols used in this investigation were reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of PLA General Hospital.\n1. Preparing the Langendorff apparatus\nPrepare the Krebs-Henseleit (K-H) buffer. To prepare the K-H buffer, add the following to distilled water: 118.0 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 25.0 mM NaHCO3, 11.1 mM glucose, and 0.5 mM EDTA.\nPrepare the modified Langendorff perfusion system.\n\t\nContinuously gas the flask containing K-H buffer with 95% O2 + 5% CO2 at a pressure of approximately 80 mmHg. Place one end of the perfusion tube in the K-H buffer, pass the middle of the perfusion tube through the water bath, and attach a blunt 20 G needle to the other end of the perfusion tube.\nSuspend the needle on a wire stand. Adjust the temperature of the water bath so that the temperature of the K-H buffer from the end of the perfusion system is 37.0 °C ± 1.0 °C.\n2. Preparing the hardware and software\nHardware\n\t\nUse a physiological signal recorder to digitize and record all the analog signals. Use two stainless steel needle electrodes to record a bipolar electrocardiogram (ECG), and use two stainless steel needle electrodes for electrical stimulation.\nConnect one end of the four electrodes to the physiological signal recorder and the other end close to the area where the heart will be positioned after attachment to the apparatus.\nSoftware\n\t\nUse the laptop software to automatically recognize, adjust, and record the bipolar ECG and hemodynamic parameters. The parameters include the left ventricular pressure difference (LVPD), the difference between the left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), and the heart rate (HR).",
    "Set the electrical stimulator parameters to 30 Hz AC, with the low voltage group receiving 2 V and the high voltage group receiving 6 V.\n3. Preparing the isolated heart\nPrepare the animal.\n\t\nAnesthetize Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats with 2% isoflurane after intraperitoneal injections of 0.05 mg/kg buprenorphine and 1,000 IU/kg heparin sodium. Ensure that the rat has stopped responding to toe pinch.\nTransfer the rat onto a small animal surgical platform, place the rat in a supine position, and sterilize the chest with 75% ethanol.\nExcise the heart.\n\t\nWith the rat connected to a ventilator after cervical dissection and tracheal intubation, lift the skin off the xiphoid process with toothed forceps, and make a 3 cm transverse incision in the skin with tissue scissors. Extend the skin and rib incisions to the axillae on both sides in a V-shape.\nReflect the sternum cranially with tissue forceps to fully expose the heart and lungs.\nIsolate and bluntly dissect the thymus using two curved forceps. Clamp the thymic tissue, and deflect it laterally on both sides to expose the aorta and its branches.\nUse curved forceps to perform a blunt separation of the aorta and the pulmonary artery, facilitating the later use of ophthalmic scissors to remove the heart and suspend the heart once it has been removed.\n\t\tNOTE: For those who are new to this procedure, step 3.2.4 can be omitted.\nUse blunt dissection to separate the brachiocephalic trunk from the surrounding tissue. Then, clamp the brachiocephalic trunk with curved forceps to facilitate the removal of the heart. Rapidly cut the aorta between the brachiocephalic trunk and the left common carotid artery. The rat dies as soon as the heart is removed.",
    "Cut off the redundant tissue, and immediately immerse the heart in a Petri dish with K-H buffer at 0-4 °C to wash and pump out the residual blood.\n\t\tNOTE: The transection of the aorta between the brachiocephalic trunk and the left common carotid artery is recommended because preserving the trunk allows for the identification of the aorta and the estimation of the depth of cannulation.\nSuspend the heart.\n\t\nTransfer the heart to a second Petri dish. Identify the aorta. Use two ophthalmic forceps to lift the aorta, and insert the blunt needle into the Langendorff apparatus.\nAdjust the aortic depth to the appropriate position. Have an assistant tie a knot with a 0 suture thread. Then, turn on the perfusion flow regulator.\n\t\tNOTE: Take care to avoid any air bubbles entering the heart throughout the procedure. Furthermore, be aware that the time from cutting the aorta to the initial perfusion should not exceed 2 min.\nInsert a small modified latex balloon connected to a pressure transducer into the left atrium, and push the balloon through the mitral valve into the left ventricle. Fill the balloon with distilled water to achieve an end-diastolic pressure of 5-10 mmHg.\nConnect the ECG and electrical stimulation electrodes to the heart. Then, place the heart in a jacketed glass chamber to maintain an internal temperature of 37.0 °C ± 1.0 °C.\n\t\t​NOTE: Use the following exclusion criteria: heart rate <250 beats per minute; coronary flow (mL/min) <10 mL/min or >25 mL/min. The ECG and electrical stimulation electrode connection positions are shown in Figure 1A, and the jacketed glass chamber is shown in Figure 1B.\n4. Perfusing and electrically stimulating the heart (Figure 2)\nEquilibrium stage (0-30 min)",
    "Start the perfusion, and maintain a temperature of approximately 37 °C until the heart beats spontaneously; then, allow the heart to equilibrate for 20 min.\nAdjust the water bath temperature to maintain the temperature within the jacketed glass chamber at approximately 30 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The entire cooling process should last approximately 10 min.\nElectrical stimulation stage (30-120 min)\n\t\nAfter the temperature has reached the desired level, activate the electrical stimulation switch on the laptop software.\n\t\tNOTE: The bipolar ECG and left ventricular pressure (LVP) at the beginning of electrical stimulation are shown in Figure 3A.\nIf the animal is part of the continuously stimulated long-term VF group, allow 90 min of electrical stimulation. If the animal is in the induced spontaneous long-term VF group, allow 5 min of electrical stimulation, then turn off the electrical stimulation, and allow 90 min for spontaneous long-term VF, as shown in Figure 3B.\n\t\tNOTE: For hearts in the spontaneous long-term VF group that do not develop spontaneous VF within 90 min after electrical stimulation, the electrical stimulation is then turned off as they do not meet the inclusion criteria.\nRewarming, defibrillation, and beating stage (120-180 min)\n\t\nAfter 90 min of VF, use electrodes to give 0.1 J of direct current defibrillation, as shown in Figure 3C.\nSimultaneously regulate the water bath temperature to allow the temperature to rise slowly within the jacketed glass chamber to about 37 °C. Continue the warming process for approximately 10 min.\nAfter defibrillation, allow the heart to beat for 60 min, and then stop the beating by slow perfusion with 10% KCl at approximately 37 °C. Remove the heart for further analysis.",
    "​NOTE: Hearts that do not beat after defibrillation do not meet the inclusion criteria. In addition, it is important to collect the coronary effusion before cooling (at 20 min), after defibrillation (at 120 min), and at the end of the experiment (at 180 min).\n5. Performing the creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) assay and histological analysis\nCK-MB assay\n\t\nUse an automatic biochemistry analyzer and commercial CK-MB assay kit to determine the level of CK-MB in the collected coronary effusion fluid8.\nHistological analysis\n\t\nFix the heart in buffered 10% formalin, dehydrate the heart, and embed it in paraffin.\nUse a microtome to cut the paraffin-embedded tissue into 5 µm sections; then, mount the sections on glass slides, and stain with hematoxylin and eosin9.\nSubscription Required.
