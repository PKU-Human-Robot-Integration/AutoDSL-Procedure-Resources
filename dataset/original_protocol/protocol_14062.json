    "NOTE: The detailed steps taken to examine the effects of the ΔELREA and A702V mutation on the EGFR structure using MD simulations are discussed as follows:\n1. Structure preparation\nNOTE: In order to study the structural impacts of the ΔELREA mutation, wild-type and mutant forms of apo active, ATP-bound active and apo inactive EGFR monomer structures are prepared as follows.\nOpen the Chimera23 visualization program (https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/[href=https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/]) to prepare the wild-type apo active EGFR kinase structure. In the File menu click the Fetch by ID option and select the Protein Data Bank (PDB24) database and specify PDB code 2GS225 (2.8 Å resolution). The PDB is a repository for 3D structures solved by different experimental techniques, including X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, cryo-electron microscopy and neutron diffraction.\nBuild the missing structural elements of 2GS2 by taking these segments from the EGFR PDB structures 1M1426 (2.6 Å) and 3W2S27 (1.9 Å). To do so, open 1M14 and 3W2S and superimpose them on 2GS2 using the MatchMaker option in the Tools → Structure comparison menu.\n\t\nCrop out the segments to be added from 1M14 and 3W2S. Select the terminal atoms of the residue before the gaps in 2GS2 and the atoms to be added from 1M14 and 3W2S (for detailed information on the added segments, see Table 1). On the command line type bond sel and hit enter. This structure is the template structure.\nUse the template structure from step 1.2 to construct the ΔELREA deletion mutant form of the EGFR kinase domain. Produce the FASTA format sequence of ΔELREA EGFR by saving the sequence of the template structure (Favorite → Sequence → File → save as) and then deleting the ELREA sequence at residue numbers 746-750.",
    "Open the ΔELREA EGFR sequence in Chimera and align it with the sequence of the 2GS2 template structure using the Sequence menu. In the alignment window select the Structure → Modeller (homology)28 option.\nOn the pop-up window specify the 2GS2 composite structure as the template and the mutant sequence as the query to be modeled. Then press OK. Select a mutant model among the resulting models, based on the zDOPE score (typically the lowest score) and visual inspection.\nTo prepare the ATP-bound wild-type EGFR kinase structure, use PDB structure 2ITX29 (2.98 Å) as the principal structure. Build missing segments (see Table 1) using the structures 2GS625 (2.6 Å) and 3W2S following the procedure in step 1.2. Convert the ligand ANP in the resulting structure to ATP by opening the PDB file in a text editor and changing the N3B nitrogen atom of ANP to an oxygen atom.\nOpen the structure in step 1.4 in Chimera as stated in step 1.1. Add a magnesium ion to this structure from PDB structure 2ITN29 (2.47 Å) in order to attain a similar positioning for the Mg2+ ion.\nWith the structure resulting from step 1.5, model the ΔELREA mutant form following the step 1.3.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\n,Apo active EGFR,Apo inactive EGFR,ATP-bound active EGFR\nPrincipal structure,2GS2,2GS7,2ITX\nStructures used to build missing loops,1M14 (723-725),3W2S (958-984),2GS6 (862-865)\nStructures used to build missing loops,3W2S (967-981),4HJO (848-850),3W2S (990-1001)\nTable 1: Structures used to build composite models of apo active, apo inactive and ATP-bound active structures. Missing regions (amino acid range in parentheses) in the principal structure were constructed from the listed structures.",
    "To prepare the wild-type apo inactive EGFR kinase structure, open PDB structure 2GS725 (2.6 Å) as in step 1.1 and delete the bound ligands and crystallographic waters. Add the missing segments in 2GS7 (see Table 1) from structures 3W2S and 4HJO30 (2.75 Å) using the procedure in step 1.2. Based on the final inactive EGFR structure, prepare the mutant model using the procedure in step 1.3.\n\tNOTE: For the A702V mutation study, the EGFR asymmetric dimer structure is studied as the mutation is located at the juxtamembrane B segment of the kinase domain that forms a large part of the dimer interface. The wild-type and A702V mutant EGFR structures are prepared as follows:\nThe wild-type asymmetric dimer structure is constructed from PDB structure 2GS2, which initially is displayed in the monomeric form. To convert to the biological assembly that contains the activator and receiver kinases in the asymmetric arrangement, open 2GS2 in Chimera as in (1.1) and carry out symmetry calculations by clicking the Tools → Higher-Order Structure → Unit Cell menu. Select the 2GS2 structure and enter Make copies. Finally, select and save a single asymmetric dimer from the multiple copies of the dimer resulting from the symmetry operations.\nUsing the wild-type asymmetric EGFR structure from step 1.8, build the A702V mutant by replacing alanine 702 with valine using the Tools → Structure editing → Rotamers option in Chimera.\n\tNOTE: Collectively, six monomeric and two dimeric EGFR structures are prepared for the ΔELREA and A702V mutation studies, respectively. Each structure is subsequently processed for simulation using the protein preparation wizard in the Maestro program31 and MD simulations are made with the Amber program32.",
    "Open the structure in Maestro by using the File → import structure option. Then click on the protein preparation wizard button and select the following: add hydrogen atoms, build missing side-chain atoms, determine protonation states of ionizable residues at pH 7.0 using PROPKA, optimize the orientation of asparagine, glutamine and histidine residues for hydrogen bonding, and finally minimize the structure.\n2. System setup\nOpen the leap program included in the Amber software package. Import the ff14SB force field33 (source leaprc.protein.ff14SB) and TIP3P water molecules34 (source leaprc.water.tip3p). For the ATP-bound systems also import parameters for ATP35 (loadamberparams frcmod.phosphate, loadamberprep ATP.prep). Then, load the structure (mol = loadpdb structure.pdb).\nSolvate the structure in an octahedral box with explicit TIP3P water molecules that extends 10 Å in all directions from the surface atoms of the protein (solvateoct mol TIP3PBOX 10.0).\nCheck the built system (Check mol) and neutralize it by adding necessary ions (addions mol Na+ 0). To sufficiently model biomolecular systems, add additional Na+/Cl- atoms to the simulation box to bring the system salt concentration to 0.15 M (addions mol Na+ X, addions mol Cl- X), where X is replaced by the result of: desired salt concentration * number of water molecules * volume per water molecule * Avogadro's number.\nGenerate and save the topology and coordinate files of the system, which serve as inputs for the subsequent production simulation (saveamberparm mol X.prmtop X.inpcrd).\n3. Molecular dynamics simulation\nUsing Amber, initially subject the simulation system to 5000 cycles of steepest descent and conjugate gradient energy minimization to circumvent unfavorable configurations. Carry out the minimization in multiple steps, gradually lowering the restraint applied on solute atoms from 25 kcal mol-1 Å-2 to 0 kcal mol-1 Å-2.",
    "In the minimization input file, min.in, adjust the maxcyc variable for the total minimization cycle (maxcyc = 5000) and ncyc to state the number of cycles for the steepest descent algorithm. Use the restraint_wt variable to apply the restraint force on solute atoms specified by the restraintmask parameter. Then run the minimization as follows:\n$AMBERHOME/bin/sander -O -i min.in -o min.out -p X.prmtop -c X.inpcrd -r min.rst -ref X.inpcrd\n\t\tNOTE: The strategy and actual parameters used may vary according to one's own preferences. Details and guidance can be found from the Amber manual and website (https://ambermd.org/index.php[href=https://ambermd.org/index.php])\nHeat the system for 100 ps from 0 K to 300 K setting a 10 kcal mol-1 Å-2 restraint on solute atoms. To do so, set tempi = 0.0, temp0 = 300.0, dt = 0.002 ps, nstlim = 50000 and restraint_wt = 10 in the heat.in input file. Carry out the heating with the following command:\n$AMBERHOME/bin/sander -O -i heat.in -o heat.out -p X.prmtop -c min.rst -r heat.rst -x heat.mdcrd -ref min.rst\nEquilibrate the system for 900 ps under an NPT ensemble; constant number of atoms, temperature (temp0 = 300.0) and pressure (ntp = 1), controlling it with the Berendsen method (ntt = 1). Set a 9 Å distance cutoff (cut = 9.0) for long range electrostatic interactions. Gradually lower the solute atom restraint to 0.1 kcal mol-1 Å-2 (restraint_wt = 0.1). Run the equilibration input file equil.in that describes the above parameters as follows:\n$AMBERHOME/bin/sander -O -i equil.in -o equil.out -p X.prmtop -c heat.rst -r equil.rst -x equil.mdcrd -ref heat.rst\nFinalize the equilibration with an unrestrained 5 ns simulation (set dt = 0.002 ps, ntslim = 2500000).\n$AMBERHOME/bin/sander -O -i equil_final.in -o equil_final.out -p X.prmtop -c equil.rst -r equil_final.rst -x equil_final.mdcrd -ref equil.rst",
    "Check that the system has equilibrated by examining the temperature, pressure, density and energy values.\n$AMBERHOME/bin/process_mdout.perl heat.out equil.out equil_final.out\nxmgrace summary.TEMP/DENSITY/ETOT/EPTOT/EKTOT\nCarry out the production simulation for 100 ns (set dt = 0.002 ps, ntslim = 50000000 in prod.in) and save conformations every 10 ps (ntwx = 5000).\n$AMBERHOME/bin/sander -O -i prod.in -o prod.out -p X.prmtop -c equil_final.rst -r prod.rst -x prod.mdrcd -ref equil_final.rst\n4. Analysis\nVisual inspection\n\t\nVisualize the conformations sampled during the wild-type and mutant EGFR kinase simulations by opening the X.prmtop amber topology files and the corresponding prod.mdcrd trajectory files in VMD36. Using convenient secondary structure representations, analyze the overall structural dynamics of the proteins from the recorded trajectory. View specific interactions between atoms/residues of interest, such as the catalytically essential K745 - E762 salt bridge.\nAlternatively, save multiple conformations sampled during the simulation in PDB format and open them using the Chimera program. Superimpose the structures on the initial or median structure using the MatchMaker option. Display the initial/median structure in solid and the rest of the aligned structures in faded white. This approach allows one to visualize the recorded structural movements with more clarity.\n\t\tNOTE: Suggestions for effective representations and processing of conformational ensembles from MDS can be found in Melvin et al.37.\nRMSD and RMSF analysis",
    "Compute root-mean square deviation (RMSD) and root-mean square fluctuation (RMSF) calculations with the Cpptraj program38 to analyze the global stability of the proteins and examine the flexibility of the different structural units. In the rmsd.in and rmsf.in input files, indicate the backbone atoms (for RMSD) and Cα atoms (for RMSF) of the initial structure as the reference for RMS fitting. In the rmsd/rmsf.in files import the amber topology files (parm X.promtop) and the corresponding trajectory files (trajin prod.mdcrd). Then run the command Cpptraj -i rmsd/rmsf.in. Plot the output data for analysis.\nAlternatively, align conformational ensembles and color each residue based on the Cα atom RMSD. To do so, open the conformations in Chimera and align them with Matchmaker option.\n\t\t\nGo to Tools → Depiction → Render by attribute. Select Residues of the conformational ensemble and Cα RMSD as the attributes and click OK. The chain trace of the conformations will then be colored from blue → white → red, respectively reflecting regions of high, medium and low structural stability.\nHydrogen bond analysis\n\t\nAnalyze the hydrogen bond interaction between ATP and wild-type/ΔELREA EGFRs. Prepare a Cpptraj script, hbond.in, to carry out this task. Define a hydrogen bond with a donor-acceptor distance of less than or equal to 3.5 Å and a bond angle of greater than or equal to 135°. Specify analysis only for intermolecular hydrogen bonds with the nointramol variable i.e. hydrogen bonds between ATP and EGFR (hbond All nointramol dist 3.5 out nhb.agr avgout avghb.dat). Run the script as Cpptraj -i hbond.in.\nUse this script to assess intramolecular interactions, for instance between residues K745 and E762, which are key residues for EGFR kinase activity. To do so, specify K745 as the hydrogen bond donor and E762 as the hydrogen bond acceptor in hbond.in and run the script accordingly.",
    "Monitoring distance between atoms\n\t\nMeasure the distance between K745 and E762 by opening the trajectories of wild-type and ΔELREA apo EGFRs in VMD. Select the Cδ of Glu762 and Nz of Lys745 by clicking Mouse → label → bond. Monitor the distance during the simulation by plotting a graph with graphics → labels → bond → graph.\nFree energy calculations\n\t\nTo compute the estimated binding free energies between ATP and wild-type/ΔELREA EGFRs, and between the activator and receiver kinases of wild-type/A702V EGFRs, use the molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) module39 available in the AMBER package. Set ATP as the ligand and EGFR as the receptor in the ΔELREA study. In the A702V study, specify the receiver kinase as the ligand and the activator kinase as the receptor.\nFirst prepare the ligand, receptor and ligand-receptor complex PDB files separately in the leap program setting the PBRadii value to mbondi2. For the PDB files, save the gas phase amber topology (.prmtop) and coordinate (.inpcrd) files.\nThen, in the mmgbsa input file, mmgbsa.in, set igb = 2, saltcon = 0.1. Execute binding energy calculations using the trajectories of the simulations, the prepared receptor/ligand amber files and the parameters in the mmgbsa.in with the MMPBSA.py script available in Amber as follows:\n$AMBERHOME/bin/MMPBSA.py -O -i mmgbsa.in -o mmgbsa.dat -sp X.prmtop -cp complex.prmtop -rp receptor.prmtop -lp ligand.prmtop -y prod.mdcrd -eo output.csv\nAnalyze the output data, output.csv, by plotting graphs."
