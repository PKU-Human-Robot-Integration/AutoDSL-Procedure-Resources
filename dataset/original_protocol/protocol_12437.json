    "All of the following procedures are conducted in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at LSU Health Sciences Center-Shreveport, and comply with the National Institute of Health guidelines.\n1. Pre-exercise Procedures\nNote: A timeline of all of the relevant procedures in this forced exercise regimen is diagrammed in Figure 1.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51827/51827fig1highres.jpg",
    "Figure 1. Forced exercise regimen timeline. This timeline details the important events of each phase of this exercise regimen during each week of the study. The pre-acclimation phase (weeks 1-2) involves experimenter handling and baseline locomotor activity. During the acclimation phase (weeks 3-4) all rats undergo 3 days of acclimation training where they sit on the stationary treadmill and then 10 days of acclimation training to the treadmill. A minimum of two rounds of exercise (1 round = 12 consecutive days) followed by a 2-week rest period is required during the exercise training phase (weeks 5-10). Behavioral and/or neurochemical measurements can be made during these rest periods. Furthermore, this regimen can be modified to include multiple rounds of exercise in this phase. Body weight is measured throughout all phases of the study on a weekly basis, and before (first session) and after (last session) each phase of this exercise regimen. Treadmill exercise training scores are assigned after all acclimation and exercise training sessions, and range from 1-4, with 4 being the highest possible score. Briefly, a training score of 4 is assigned when rats exercise the entire training session without assistance. Similarly, assign a training score of 3 when rats require minimal assistance (defined as: assistance for less than 25% of the time of the training session) from the experimenter. Assign a training score of 2 when rats require much assistance (defined as: assistance for greater than 25% of the time of the training session) from the experimenter during the exercise session. Finally, allocate a training score of 1 to rats that are noncompliant and fail to complete an exercise session.\nUpon arrival to the animal colony, separate and singly house all subjects into standard shoebox cages. Provide food and water ad libitum to subjects throughout the entire study.",
    "Maintain a reverse 12-hr light-dark cycle (lights on from 1800 to 0600 hr) in the animal colony, and allow subjects to acclimate to this cycle for a minimum of one week. Perform all behavioral experiments during the subject’s active (dark) cycle, and 1-2 hr prior to the light-dark cycle change.\nBeginning two weeks prior to any behavioral experiments, handle all test subjects for several minutes daily to familiarize the subject with the experimenter, and to decrease novelty-induced stress to unfamiliar environments, such as the locomotor chamber and the treadmill.\nMeasure each subject’s body weight once a week, and immediately before (first session) and after (last session) each major interval of the exercise paradigm.\n2. Baseline Locomotor Activity Assessments: Determining Forced Exercise Group Assignments\nAssess each subject’s spontaneous locomotor activity for 60 min/day for 5 consecutive days to establish baseline locomotor capabilities. Conduct locomotor activity sessions in automated open-field locomotor activity chambers consisting of a plexiglass box (45 x 45 x 20 cm3) with a grid of infrared beams mounted horizontally and vertically as suggested in the product manual.\nAt the beginning of each day of the locomotor activity assessments, load, and set up the computer and software program connected to the open-field locomotor activity chambers in order to record the number of beam breaks (locomotor activity) during each session.\nAdd approximately 2 cups of pine-chip bedding to the floor of the locomotor chamber prior to each session.\nTransport the subjects from the animal colony to the locomotor activity chambers in their home cages immediately prior to their locomotor activity session. Load subjects into their assigned locomotor chamber under a red light, and start the 60 min session on the computer once they have been placed into the chamber.",
    "Upon completion of the locomotor activity session, remove subjects from the locomotor chamber and return them to their home cage under red light. Immediately return the subjects back to the animal colony.\nRemove bedding from the chamber and clean the chamber walls and floor with 50% ethanol after each session.\nRepeat steps 2.3-2.6 for additional locomotor sessions each day as needed until all subjects have been tested. Conduct all locomotor activity sessions in the dark, during the animal’s active cycle, and 1-2 hr prior to the light-dark cycle change.\nTo account for the possibility of habituation to the activity chambers, rotate each subject among the available chambers such that locomotor activity is measured in a different chamber from the previous day.\n\t\nIf multiple sessions need to be conducted in one day, change the order of testing such that subjects are tested in a different order than the previous session.\nFrom the data generated by the software used to measure locomotor activity, determine each animal’s baseline locomotor activity with the following 5 locomotor parameters: total distance traveled (cm), horizontal activity (number of beam breaks), movement number (number of initiated movements), time spent moving (sec), and movement speed (cm/sec).\n\t\nIn order to assign exercise and nonexercise groups, calculate the mean value across all 5 sessions for each of the 5 locomotor parameters listed in step 2.9 above.",
    "From these 5 parameters, determine exercise and nonexercise (control) groups such that an equal range of locomotor activity is represented in both groups. In this way, pair rats together based on similar movement capabilities, and assign one rat to the exercise group and one rat to the nonexercise group. Thus, for example, pair the two rats that exhibit the highest average of all 5 locomotor parameters together, and assign one rat to the exercise group and the other to the nonexercise group (group assignments are chosen at random). Repeat this process for the remaining subjects.\n\t\nMaintain pairing throughout the entire forced exercise regimen and for all data analyses.\nIf the experimenter is interested in the effects of exercise on locomotor activity, measure post-exercise locomotor activity using the same procedures described in steps 2.1-2.8.1 beginning the day after the last treadmill exercise session. NOTE: If the investigator is interested and/or the automated locomotor activity software permits, examine anxiety-related measures (i.e., time spent in periphery vs. the center of activity chamber) to assess the relative anxiety of subjects during locomotor activity assessments.\n3. Acclimation to the Treadmill\nConduct all treadmill exercise-related procedures on a motorized rodent treadmill with lanes that are separated by clear plexiglass walls during the animal’s active cycle, and 1-2 hr prior to the light-dark cycle change.\nIn place of the electrical shock coils located at the back of each lane, use a plexiglass backstop designed specifically to fit the treadmill so that subjects can continuously exercise without coming into contact with the electrical shock coils. To prevent the backstop from sliding during the training sessions, hold the backstop in place with a 1.5 in c-clamp.\nDue to the experimenter handling required for treadmill exercise training, conduct all treadmill exercise sessions with the lights on.",
    "Transport subjects in their home cage to the treadmill immediately prior to their treadmill exercise training session. When the treadmill is stationary, load rats onto the treadmill in their assigned lane by sliding up the backstop just enough that subjects can maneuver under the backstop. Slide the backstop back down to the resting position once the subject is situated on the treadmill belt. Do not start the session until all subjects have been placed in their assigned lane for that particular session.\n\t\nDuring the first phase of acclimation, place each rat on one of the four lanes of the stationary treadmill (as described in step 3.4) for 5-10 min/day for 3 consecutive days. Increase the time of each session with each successive day (e.g., 5 min on day 1, 7 min on day 2, and 10 min on day 3) as the rats become familiar with the treadmill apparatus and to reduce the potential for novelty stress to the treadmill apparatus. Important: Do not place rats anywhere on the treadmill (e.g., deactivated electrical shock coils) except the stationary belt at this stage.\nDuring the second phase of acclimation training, place each rat on one lane of the stationary treadmill in front of the backstop. When all subjects are in place, turn the treadmill on to a slow walking speed (e.g., 6 m/min). Regardless of experimental grouping, train all rats to walk on the treadmill during this phase to ensure that any potential effects observed from the forced exercise regimen result from the exercise training and not simply from the ability to exercise.",
    "As the belt of the treadmill begins to roll, ensure that all rats are walking in the forward direction. Assist rats as necessary by orienting or gently prodding them until they are moving forward. During the acclimation training period, train rats to walk on the treadmill such that they continuously walk on the treadmill without assistance from the experimenter.\n\t\nAcclimate all rats to the treadmill by gradually increasing the speed over a period of 5-10 min/day for 10 consecutive days. To further facilitate compliance to treadmill exercise, train the rats at low speeds (6-8 m/min) for 5-10 min during the first 5 acclimation sessions, and increase to more moderate speeds (9-10 m/min) for 5-10 min during the last 5 acclimation sessions.\nEnsure that all rats can maintain a speed of 9-10 m/min for 10 min by the last session of the acclimation training period.\nUpon completion of the treadmill acclimation session, remove subjects from the treadmill in the same manner used to load subjects as described in step 3.4. Immediately return subjects to their home cage and transport them back to the animal colony.\nWipe down each individual lane including the walls and treadmill belt with 50% ethanol after each individual treadmill exercise training session.",
    "Ascertain the exercise capabilities of each rat across the exercise sessions by assigning a treadmill exercise score at the conclusion of each daily session. Assign a training score of 4 when rats exercise the entire training session without assistance. Similarly, assign a training score of 3 when rats require minimal assistance (defined as: assistance for less than 25% of the time of the training session) from the experimenter. Assign a training score of 2 when rats require much assistance (defined as: assistance for greater than 25% of the time of the training session) from the experimenter during the exercise session. Finally, allocate a training score of 1 to rats that are noncompliant and fail to complete an exercise session.\n\tNOTE: The exercise scoring system is adapted, in part, from other studies19.\n\t\nExclude rats that cannot complete the acclimation phase due to noncompliance and/or an injury that prevents subjects from exercising (e.g., this includes rats that earn a treadmill exercise training score of 1 for more than one consecutive day of acclimation training).\nAverage the treadmill scores across each training period (e.g., acclimation training and exercise training) to determine the exercise capabilities of each subject. Ensure that all rats are able earn a treadmill exercise score of 4 during a training session by the end of the acclimation period.\n\t\nIf some rats are not compliant to the top exercise speeds maintained by others throughout a training session, adjust the speed for these rats so that they are able to continue exercising for the same amount of time but at a slower speed throughout the training sessions. In this instance, train slower rats in separate sessions and increase the speed as the subjects adjust to the slower speeds.",
    "To avoid the potential for lane bias on the treadmill during treadmill exercise training, rotate each rat among the available lanes of the treadmill so that they are training in a different lane with each subsequent exercise session.\n4. Treadmill Exercise Training\nBegin the exercise training sessions the day following the last acclimation training session, and continue exercising rats for 12 consecutive days. Conduct these sessions during the animal’s active cycle, and 1-2 hr prior to the light-dark cycle change.\nFollow the same set-up procedures for each treadmill exercise training session used during acclimation training, as described in steps 3.2 and 3.4.\nAt the start of each session, turn on the treadmill to a lower, warm-up speed (8 m/min) than the training speed (9-11 m/min) that will be maintained throughout the remainder of the exercise training session. Continue with this warm-up speed for 5-10 min at the beginning of the session. Adjust the speed to 9-11 m/min for the remainder of the training session. Train subjects an average of 30 min each session for the entire 12 days of exercise training.\nAfter each exercise training session, assign a treadmill exercise score to all rats in the exercise group using the same exercise scoring system described in step 3.9. Do not assign a training score during the treadmill exercise training period to nonexercise rats.\nConduct the exercise and nonexercise sessions separately. Place the nonexercise rats on the stationary treadmill for the same duration that their exercise cohort trained during each session.\nAs described in step 3.11, rotate each rat among the available lanes of the treadmill so that they are training in a different lane with each subsequent exercise session.",
    "Upon completion of one round of exercise, rest subjects for 14 days. NOTE: This rest period was chosen based on the results from the pilot study described in Figures 2A and 2B.\nIf desired, conduct various behavioral and/or neurochemical assessments at the end of the 12-day training period. Conversely, continue with subsequent rounds of exercise training following the 14 day rest period.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
