    "Vector construction PCR amplification of the Arabidopsis AtATG8a (AT4G21980) gene: Isolate total RNA from 7-day-old seedlings using the Plant RNAout kit (Tiandz Inc.,160906-50), and then convert 1 μg of total RNA to cDNA using the HiScript® II Q RT SuperMix for qPCR Kit (Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd, R222-01) with oligo(dT)20. Amplify the AtATG8a gene using PCR with the forward primer 5’-CTGCGGCAGCGGCCGAATTCATGGCTAAGAGTTCCTTCAA-3’ and the reverse primer 5’-ATCTAGATCCGGTGGATCCATCCAAAAGTGTTCTCTCCAC-3’ (40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 30 s).Note: PCR primers should be designed to contain at least 20 bp overlapping sequences (underlined) to a linearized cloning pEGAD vector (see Figure 1A). Cloning the AtATG8a gene into the pEGAD vector: Linearize the pEGAD vector (NCBI accession No. AF218816) with the restriction enzymes EcoRI and BamHI at 37 °C for 4 h, and then purify with the HiPure Gel DNA Mini Kit (Magen, D2111-03). Assemble the linearized pEGAD vector and the amplified AtATG8a fragment using the ClonExpress® II One-Step Cloning Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions (Vazyme Biotech Co., C112-01). Construct the vector containing protein of interest (POI, pEGAD-POI-mCherry) using a similar method (Figure 1C).Note: For each POI, two constructs should be designed, with one containing a fluorescent protein at its N−terminus, and the other at the C−terminus. Some general guidelines for creating fluorescent fused protein in plants can be found in Tanz et al. (2013). E. coli transformation: Mix the 10 μL of the above reaction solution with 100 μL E. coli DH5α competent cells and incubate on ice for 30 min. Heat the cells in a 37 °C water bath for 90 s and incubate on ice for 1–2 min. Add 700 μL of LB to the cells and shake at 37 °C, 200 rpm for 1 h for recovery.",
    "Centrifuge at 5,000 rpm for 3 min, then discard 600 μL of supernatant and resuspend the pellet in the remaining supernatant. Spread on an LB plate containing 50 µg/mL of kanamycin and incubate for 12–14 h at 37 °C. Perform colony PCR to identify positive clones and verify by Sanger sequencing with primer: 5’-AATCATCGCAAGACCGGCAACAGGAT-3’.Agrobacterium transformation: Mix 1 µg of verified plasmid with 200 μL GV3101 competent cells and incubate on ice for 30 min. Freeze the cells with liquid nitrogen for 1–2 min and then thaw by incubating in a 37 °C water bath for 2 min. Add 1 mL of LB to the cells and shake at 28 °C, 200 rpm for 4 h for recovery. Centrifuge at 7,000 rpm for 1 min, discard 1 mL of supernatant, and resuspend the pellet in the remaining supernatant. Spread the cells on LB plates containing appropriate antibiotics and incubate at 28 °C for 2 days for colony formation.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4486/bioprotoc-12-16-4486-g001.jpgFigure 1.

    "tumefaciens colony for each construct and inoculate into 15 mL of LB liquid medium containing appropriate antibiotics (50 μg/mL of kanamycin, 50 μg/mL of rifampicin, 10 μg/mL of gentamycin) in a 50 mL mini bioreactor tube. Shake at 200 rpm, 28 °C for 16–24 h until OD600 = 0.8–1.5.Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 6,000 rpm, 4 °C, for 10 min. Resuspend the cells with fresh suspension buffer (see Recipes) to a final concentration of OD600 = 1.2 and keep at 25 °C for more than 4 h before infiltration (Figure 2A).Note: As a common practice, acetosyringone is added into bacterial cultures to activate Agrobacterium virulence. The optimal acetosyringone (150 µM) treatment usually requires at least 4 h. Mix equal volumes of the cells containing the pEGAD-GFP-ATG8a and pEGAD-POI-mCherry or negative control pEGAD-mCherry constructs, and infiltrate on the abaxial side of the tobacco leaf using a 1 mL needleless syringe. Each half of the leaf is infiltrated with about 100 μL of bacterial mixture (Figure 2B), and the infiltrated areas are labeled with a marker pen (Figure 2C).Note: Infiltrate tobacco leaf carefully to avoid damaging leaf. Keep the infiltrated tobacco seedlings in a growth chamber at 28 °C under 16/8 h light/dark for 24–36 h.Concanamycin A (ConA) infiltration Excise a small leaf disc close to the site of infiltration and examine the expression of GFP or mCherry-tagged proteins in a fluorescence microscope.Infiltrate diluted ConA solution (1 μM) with 1 mL needleless syringe over the marked leaf areas (Figure 2D). Cut the leaves when ConA solution is almost absorbed (usually takes about 15 min, Figure 2E).Note: ConA is a specific inhibitor of vacuolar-type ATPases and is often used to stabilize the autophagic bodies (Dröse et al., 1993; Dettmer et al., 2006).",
    "The diluted ConA solution must be prepared freshly before use by adding 998 μL fresh suspension buffer to 2 μL ConA stock solution (0.5 mM). Moreover, it is important to use a different injection site for ConA infiltration. Remove the midvein of detached leaves and place into Petri dishes containing two layers of filter paper pre-wetted with MS liquid medium without sugar (MS-C medium, see Recipes) (Figure 2F). Cover the leaves with one more layer of pre-wetted filter paper and gently press against the leaves to keep them wet (Figure 2G).Note: Carbon starvation is a common approach for autophagy induction. To do so, MS-C liquid medium is used here, and ConA-infiltrated leaves are cut and placed in the dark. Moreover, add about 1.5 mL of MS-C medium to wet filter paper. Too much water will cause cell death in the leaves. Cover the Petri dishes with aluminum foil and keep in a growth chamber at 28 °C for 36 h.
