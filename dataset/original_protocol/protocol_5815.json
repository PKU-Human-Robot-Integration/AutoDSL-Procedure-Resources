    "C. elegans strain and maintenanceThe transgenic strain QC114 carries the etEx2 extrachromosomal transgene that supports expression of a membrane-associated prenylated GFP in intestinal cells (Mörck et al., 2009) and is available from the C. elegans Genetics Center (CGC; MN; USA). The etEx2 transgene should be maintained by picking rollers and can be easily crossed into any mutant or genetic background of interest; the example below assumes that etEx2 has been crossed into a mutant background such as paqr-2(tm3410) where membrane fluidity is clearly reduced by dietary SFAs (Svensk et al., 2016; Devkota et al., 2017).Note: The transgene is in the form of an extrachromosomal array but this is not a concern since the experiment is performed only in the GFP-positive worms (Figure 1B) (Video 1). Grow transgenic worms at 20 °C on 60 mm plates pre-seeded with approximately 200 μl of an overnight culture of E. coli OP50, which was maintained on LB plates and kept at 4 °C (re-streaked every 6-8 weeks) (Stiernagle, 2006).Bleach the gravid hermaphrodites and allow the eggs to hatch overnight in M9 buffer (Stiernagle, 2006; He, 2011). Transfer the synchronized L1 larvae to new plates containing 20 mM glucose. Prepare 20 mM glucose plates using filter sterilized (0.2 μm filter is used) and freshly prepared stock solution of 1 M glucose, which is added to cooled but still molten (~60 °C) NGM after autoclaving; seed these plates with E. coli OP50 as above.Note: Glucose is readily converted into SFAs by the dietary E. coli, resulting in membrane rigidification in the paqr-2 mutant (Devkota et al., 2017). The control and paqr-2 mutant have the same membrane fluidity on normal culture plates lacking glucose.",
    "After 16 h of incubation at 20 °C, mount the transgenic worms (rollers) on 2% agarose pads in a drop of 100 mM levamisole (dissolved in water; to paralyze the worms), and apply a cover glass.Notes: The worms are usually in the L2 stage after the overnight incubation; at this early stage, the etEx2 transgene is expressed strongly and marks clearly the intestinal plasma membranes.Mount 20-25 transgenic worms (rollers) per agarose pad in 1-1.5 μl of 100 mM levamisole. This step is critical to avoid worm twitching or movement. FRAP configuration: Confocal microscopeTurn on the microscope, laser and computer. Launch the Zeiss Zen 2012 software. In the Locate tab, click on Microscope Control. Choose bright field or fluorescence. Choose green (FSet10 wf) filter for fluorescence. The entire experiment is performed with 40x water immersion objective (Numerical Aperture 1.1).Go to the Acquisition tab to begin a new FRAP configuration. Use Smart Setup, choose EGFP dye and 488 nm laser.Make sure the objective is a 40x water immersion objective. For continuous confocal scanning, use the frame mode with 12-bit intensity resolution over 256 x 256 pixels (digital zoom 4x) and a pixel dwell time of 1.58 μsec. Use the unidirectional scanning and set pinhole to 1 Airy Unit (Figure 1A).For photobleaching, choose time series, bleaching and the regions tab. Choose appropriate shape and size of the bleaching region. This protocol is based on a circular region with a 7-pixel radius. The entire experiment consists of 200 cycles and each cycle runs for 242.04 msec (Time Series tab). Bleaching can be set using 20 iterations using 50% laser power transmission. Set up to take 10 scans before starting the photobleaching. Under these settings, approximately 60-70% of the signal is bleached.Save the configuration.",
    "Microscopy and data acquisitionIn the Locate tab, under the microscope control, use the bright field to find a worm. It is important that the worms are well immobilized: any movement will compromise FRAP measurement.In the Acquisition tab, open the saved FRAP configuration (from Step B5). Make sure that the signal is neither saturated nor below the detection level (saturation and lack of fluorescence signal is generally indicated as red and blue spots respectively). This can easily be adjusted using the ‘Master Gain’ and ‘Digital Offset’ function. Note that one has to click on ‘Range Indicator’ tab to visualize the saturation level.Select a region of the intestinal cell that is not saturated and use the circular region with a 7-pixel radius to photobleach (Figure 1B).Note: In our experience, it is not necessary to select a GFP-rich plasma membrane as control region; the effect of bleaching due to scanning seems to affect all regions equally.Start the continuous scan (Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Illustration of FRAP. The first twenty cycles of the FRAP experiment. Red circle of 7-pixel radius is the bleaching region. After the scanning, click on the ‘Mean ROI’ tab and select a control reference region in the sample that was not bleached. This will be used to compensate for the effect of bleaching on the overall signal.Save the image and the table (.txt format) that shows the fluorescent intensity of the entire experiment."
