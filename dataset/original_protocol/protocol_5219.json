    "Plasma membrane protein preparationSuspend the plasma membrane (PM) pellets (isolated according to Han et al., 2010) with 100 μl 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8.Note: The recommended PM protein concentration is 1 μg/μl. This protocol set 100 μg PM protein as an example, so use 100 μl buffer to suspend the pellets. Add 25 μl 1% (w/v) RapiGest SF stock to the working concentration of 0.2% (w/v), mix well and then boil the mixture at ~100 °C for 5 min to dissolve proteins from PM.Note: RapiGest SF is an acid labile denaturant (Figure 1A) which could solubilize and unfold proteins to make them more amenable for cleavage (Figure 1B). The recommended RapiGest SF working concentration is 0.1% (w/v). For PM proteins increase the incubation time (at 37 °C, up to 1 h is safe; at 100 °C, 5 min is enough) or use higher RapiGest SF concentration (up to 0.5% [w/v] is safe) could make the following digestion more efficient.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170513/20170513010357_6359.jpgFigure 1. Working principle of RapiGest SF surfactant. A. RapiGest SF can be easily broken down by acidification and then removed by centrifugation. B. RapiGest SF is a mild denaturant which making proteins more amenable for cleavage without disrupting the endoproteases activity.

Alkylation: cool down the mixture to RT, and add 14 μl 0.5 M iodoacetamide stock to a working concentration of 50 mM, mix them gently and then incubate at RT, dark, for 45 min. Digestion: add 20 μl 0.",
    "1 μg/μl trypsin stock to the protein mixture to a working concentration of 1:50 (w/w), mix them gently and then incubate at 37 °C for 12 h. Acidification: add 0.5 μl formic acid to the mixture to a working concentration of 0.2-0.5% (v/v) (pH < 2), incubate at 37 °C for 30-45 min, then centrifuge at 4 °C, 20,000 x g for 20 min to remove RapiGest SF. Discharge the pellets, transfer the supernatant to a new tube.Desalting: use C18 filled spin column to concentrate and purify the peptides mixture.Note: If the peptides mixture is less than 5.0 μg, please use ZipTip® pipette tip to do the desalting. Put the purified peptides mixture into SpeedVac system to lyophilize for the following fractionation use.Peptides mixture fractionationThe following protocol was modified from Zhu et al. (2009). It performs on the AKTA purifier-10 system with the strong cation exchange (SCX) PolySULFOETHYL ATM column.Resuspend the lyophilized peptides mixture in solvent A.Run solvent B for 20 min, then solvent A for 30 min through the AKTA purifier-10 system to balance the PolySULFOETHYL ATM column.Load the suspended peptides and run the following gradient at a flow rate of 200 μl/min, collect the products in every 2 min.0-5 min: 100% solvent A5-95 min: 0-60% solvent B95-115 min: 60%-100% solvent B115-145 min: 100% solvent B145-155 min: 100% solvent ARun ddH2O for 20 min, then 100% acetonitrile for 10 min to store the column.Pool the products according to the 214 nm UV absorption peak (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170513/20170513010815_2246.jpgFigure 2. SCX fractionation of peptides mixture from rice mature pollen grain. According to the 214 nm UV absorption peak, the peptides mixture can be pooled into 14 fractions for LC-MS/MS analysis.Use C18 spin column or ZipTip® pipette tip to purify the combined products.Lyophilize the purified products for mass spectrometry identification."
