    "All of the procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Chungnam National University Hospital.\n1. Measurement with Ultrasonography\nSet the posture of the patient.\n\t\nLay the patient's arm in a supine position, with both arms on the bed.\nDetermine the measurement sites on the patient's upper limb.\n\t\nMark in the mid-point of the wrist crease, the mid-point between the medial and lateral epicondyles at the level of the elbow, and the bicipital groove by a pen.\nUsing a pen directly connect these three points by a ruler. Mark the two target areas on the upper arm and forearm (Figure 1).\n\t\t\nMark the proximal part, 10 cm proximal to the elbow point along the line between the elbow and bicipital groove.\nMark the distal part, 10 cm distal to the elbow point along the line between the elbow and wrist.\nMeasure the thickness of the subcutaneous tissue and muscle of the upper limb. The procedure should be performed by a skilled sonographer.\n\t\nSwitch on the ultrasound system. Enter 2D mode of soft tissue via the keyboard. Set the depth to 5 cm.\n\t\t\nChoose the 14L5 linear array transducer.\nApply sufficient gel to the ultrasound transducer. Focus on the subcutaneous tissue.\nPlace the ultrasound transducer perpendicularly to the upper limb ventral axis. Use the short-axis view. Capture the image where the thickness of the gel is at least 1 cm and the soft tissue contour is not distorted.\nMeasure the thicknesses of the muscle and subcutaneous tissue.\n\t\t\nDraws a line by selecting the calibrator in the software via the keyboard of the ultrasound system\nMeasure the thickness of the muscle, defined as the distance from the highest point on the boundary of the bone to the highest point on the boundary portion of the fascia (Figure 2).",
    "Measure the thickness of the subcutaneous tissue, defined as the distance from the skin to the fascia.\n2. Clinical Application of Ultrasonography to BCRL\nMeasure the thickness of the subcutaneous tissue and muscle of the upper limb at baseline.\n\t\nPerform the baseline measurements in the order shown in Step 1.\nInstruct the patient to perform a series of PREs using a 0.5 kg dumbbell14.\n\t\nGive the patient a compression stocking or a multilayer bandage to wear. Choose a 0.5 kg dumbbell.\nInstruct the patient to perform the PREs in the following order: (1) dumbbell fly, (2) triceps extension, (3) one arm bent-over row, (4) biceps curl, (5) dumbbell side raise, and (6) lifting the arms forward (Figure 3).\n\t\t\nInstruct the patient to complete the 6 exercises twice a day, according to the following schedule: 5 times each during the 1st week, 10 times each during the 2nd week, 15 times each during the 3rd week, 20 times each during the 4th week, and 25Â times each during 5th-8th weeks (Figure 4).\nUse ultrasonography to identify the therapeutic effects of PRE compared to conventional therapy.\n\t\nMeasure the thickness of the subcutaneous tissue and muscle of the upper limb at 4 and 8 weeks. Perform the measurements in the order shown in Step 1.\nCalculate the thickness of the subcutaneous tissue and muscle at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks.\nAnalyze the data.\n\t\nCompare the difference between both arms using a paired t-test. Compare the changes in subcutaneous tissue and muscle thickness using a repeated-measures ANOVA.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
