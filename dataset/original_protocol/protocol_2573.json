    "Distribute agarose solution evenly on 55 mm Petri dishes.\nLet it solidify at room temperature (22°C) for at least 1 h.\nStore agarose plates, sealed in a plastic bag, at 4°C for up to 2 months.\nGenerate glass needles for embryo dissection.\nPull borosilicate thin wall capillary glass tubes, with filament and flame polished ends, using a Flaming Brown P87 needle puller (for settings see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section 3).\nCollection and processing of precisely timed embryos\nTiming: 2 days\nVNC stiffness is sensitive to the developmental stage of the embryo; therefore, assuring that AFM measurements are performed on precisely timed dissected embryos is crucial for data coherence and comparison. This step refers to the synchronization of the fly culture for collecting embryos of the same developmental stage, with a maximum of 1 h difference (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2206-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Collection and preparation of timed embryos for flat dissections.\nVisual guide summarizing the steps required for collecting, dechorionating and mounting timed Drosophila embryos. (A) Parental flies are transferred from culture vials to embryo collection chambers and are allowed to acclimatize for a minimum of 2 days. Culture synchronization is achieved by changing the apple juice-agar plate sealing the chamber every 1 h. Embryos laid within the first 1 h period are discarded (gray arrowheads), while those laid in subsequent rounds are aged (red arrowheads) until they reach the required developmental stage (in this case 12 h at 25°C to reach early stage 16).\n(B) For harvesting the embryos, the apple juice-agar plate is filled with distilled water and embryos are detached from the surface using a brush. Suspension passes through a strainer and the embryos retained are dechorionated by submerging in bleach for 1 min.",
    "(C) Dechorionated embryos are thoroughly rinsed with distilled water and aligned with their dorsal side up on a piece of double sided sticky tape placed on the dissection slide.\nSynchronization of the fly culture.\nBring 4 fresh apple juice-agar plates to room temperature and add 0.5 g of yeast paste to each one of them.\nExchange the juice-agar plate sealing the embryo collection cage to a fresh one.\nNote: In this step, the flies presented with fresh food source deposit all embryos that could possibly be retained due to environmental stress.\nAfter 1 h, repeat step 5b and discard the previous plate.\nNote: This point corresponds to collection time zero given that all embryos deposited from this point onward will be of the same developmental age.\nAfter 1 h, exchange the juice-agar plate as in 5b.\nMaintain the plate containing the embryos deposited during this time period (0–1 h After Egg Laying (AEL)) at 25°C for a total of 12 h. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nNote: The incubation time indicated is for obtaining stage 16 embryos. Stage 16, or 3-part gut stage, lasts from 13–16 h AEL at 25°C, therefore the proposed 12 h incubation of the collected embryos should yield embryos at the beginning of this stage. It is worth mentioning that embryo dissections and AFM measurements of the VNC can be done from stage 13 till early stage 17. For obtaining stage 13 embryos the incubation time is reduced to 10 h, while for stage 17 is increased to 15 h, respectively. In addition, considering development is delayed at 18°C and accelerated at 29°C, the hours AEL corresponding to stage 16 should be adjusted based on the following equations: t (at 18°C) = 1,82∗t (at 25°C) and t (at 29°C) = 0,86∗t (at 25°C) (Kuntz and Eisen, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).",
    "Repeat step 5d for a second collection round.\nNote: Considering that AFM measurements on the VNC of a single embryo require approximately 1 h, it is advisable to perform several collection rounds to ensure availability of precisely age matching embryos over an extended period of time. This step can be repeated for as many times as required.\nDechorionation: remove embryos’ chorion with bleach prior to dissection. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nDetach stage 16 embryos from the juice-agar plate.\nUse a squeeze bottle to fill the juice-agar plate with dH2O.\nWith a soft painting brush, dissolve the yeast paste added in step 5a, and gently remove the embryos from the agar surface, while swirling the water.\nWet a cell strainer through running water, under the tap.\nDecant the water containing the floating embryos to the cell strainer.\nNote: Water shall pass freely through the strainer, while embryos are retained.\nRepeat steps i, ii and iv, at least two more times, or until all embryos are transferred from the juice-agar plate to the strainer.\nWash embryos in the strainer with dH2O to remove any remaining yeast paste.\nDechorionate embryos with bleach.\nFill a 90 mm Petri dish with bleach (10 mL approximately or until the filling line) and submerge the strainer containing the embryos.\nNote: Introduce cell strainer in bleach in an angle to avoid air bubbles formed underneath.\nCritical: Incubate embryos in bleach for 1 min. Gently swirl the Petri containing the bleach to ensure embryos remain in suspension.\nNote: Dechorionation can be monitored under a dissecting scope. A small air bubble is formed at the anterior tip of each embryo, as the air trapped between the chorion and the vitelline membrane is released.\nCritical: After dechorionation, rinse the embryos extensively (for at least 10 s) with running water under the tap.",
    "Note: Take special care not to overflow the strainer. Dechorionated embryos form clusters, since the exposed vitelline membrane is hydrophobic.\nTransfer dechorionated embryos on a 55 mm Petri dish containing solid 1% agarose in dH2O.\nDry meticulously the exterior surface of strainer with paper.\nUnder a dissecting scope, transfer the embryos from the strainer to the agarose surface, using forceps.\nNote: Embryo clusters formed upon dechorionation, stick easily to the metal forceps facilitating the transfer.\nDistribute embryos evenly on the agarose surface and phenotypically cross check that embryos are on the right developmental stage (3-part gut).\nAFM tip selection\nTiming: 30 min\nAFM uses a flexible cantilever with nanometer or micrometer sized tip at its end to probe the mechanical properties of a sample. A high-precision positioning system (usually a piezoelectric system) allows for the displacement of the cantilever and for changing the relative position between the tip and the sample. The cantilever bends when local interaction between the tip and the sample occurs in the range of pN and nN. For small cantilever bending, the cantilever-tip behaves as an ideal spring, enabling computing the deflection force (F) using Hooke’s law (F=k·d), where k is the spring constant of the cantilever-tip and d the cantilever bending or deflection. The deflection is quantified by measuring the photodiode voltage signal generated by a laser focalized on top of the cantilever. The tip-sample interaction produces a deformation or indentation δ to the sample (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2206-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Four-sided pyramidal and spherical tips.",
    "Commercially available pyramidal tips with high lateral resolution introduce high strains to the sample due to its small contact tip-sample area. Spherical tips produce low strains and are suitable for very soft and fragile samples, as the Drosophila embryo VNC. In the A and B panels are shown the differences in indentation that pyramidal and spherical tips attached to a cantilever (black) exert over a flat substrate (blue). d - Cantilever deflection; δ - Indentation depth; θ - Half-opening angle of pyramid tips; Rsph - Radius of spherical tips; F - Deflection force.\nOptimal cantilever-tip selection depends on the type of sample and measurement (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]), while three main parameters need to be taken into account:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2206_3.csv\nCantilever spring constant, k: based on Hooke’s law a large k will lead to very low deflections, lowering system’s sensitivity. Therefore, the closer k is to the local sample stiffness the higher the sensitivity in the measurements of F. In our experience, cantilevers with k ∼ 0.01–0.1 N/m are a suitable starting point for very soft biological samples as the Drosophila VNC (Alcaraz et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nCritical: Tip geometry: while measuring soft and fragile samples it is important to take into account the pressure applied to the samples. The contact area between the tip and the sample depends on the tip geometry. Standard commercial tip geometries used in AFM setups can be four-sided pyramids and spheres. Based on Hertz’s model (Jorba et al., 2017b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]), the radius (a) of the projected tip-sample contact area (A=π·a2) are:\n   (Equation 1)   a =   δ ⋅ tan θ   2       \n   (Equation 2)   a =   (   R  s p h   δ  )   1 / 2",
    "For a four-sided pyramidal tip (Equation 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd1]), θ corresponds to the half-opening angle of the pyramid, while for spherical tips; Rsph represents the radius of the sphere (Equation 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd2]) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). As expected, the pyramidal tip has a lower contact area for the same δ (or F), thus, increasing the strains applied to the sample compared to a spherical tip. To evaluate the viscosity/rigidity of the extracellular matrix or cells in culture, pyramidal and spherical tips have been used indistinctively. For very soft samples, such as the Drosophila VNC, selecting a spherical tip to generate small strains is advisable to avoid damaging the sample while measuring. In this protocol, after several tests with spherical tips of different diameters, those with a relatively large radius of 10 μm were selected.\nTip material: usually commercial tips can be made of glass, polystyrene and silicon nitride depending on the tip geometry and manufacturer. Usually, glass and polystyrene tips show lower adhesion to the sample, helping to obtain reliable force curves. In our case, we employed polystyrene tips.\nEmbryo flat-prep dissection for AFM measurements on the VNC\nTiming: 10–15 min for 4 embryos\nIn this step the dissection of live stage 16 embryos is described. This process requires practice since it is crucial that the VNC is not damaged or altered in any way during dissection. Also, it is worth mentioning that since AFM measurements are performed on non-fixed tissue, handling time cannot exceed 45 min (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2206-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Live Drosophila embryo flat-prep dissection.",
    "Photos captured at key points of the embryo dissection process. Dechorionated embryos of the appropriate stage are aligned with their dorsal side up on a piece of double sided sticky tape (see also Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]), anterior is to the right (A) and covered with 0.1 M Sörensen buffer. A pulled glass needle is used for manually devitellinizing the embryos. The needle pierces the embryo anteriorly, in a flat angle, and a shallow incision is made towards the posterior tip of the embryo (B and B'). Staying within the buffer, the embryo is dragged towards the center of the dissection area and is stuck on the glass, while the vitelline membrane remains on the tape (C and C'). The incision made is used for fully dissecting the embryo and big part of the intestine is removed (D and D'). After dissecting all embryos on slide, the tip of the needle is broken in a controlled manner to achieve a wider opening, which will serve the cleaning of the dissections (E). Intestines and embryo debris are removed from the preparation by mouth suction (F and F'). Dissections are completely flattened by blowing fresh buffer on their surface (G) and the complete buffer volume on slide is exchanged prior to AFM measurements (G'). At the end of the process, both brain lobes and VNC should be fully exposed, while the lateral body wall should be intact and flattened on the slide (H). Scale bar is 50 μm.\nPrepare the dissection slide.\nPlace a Super Frost glass slide, with its positively charged surface facing up, under a dissecting scope (preferentially one equipped with an underneath light source).\nCreate an approximately 3 cm × 1.5 cm rectangular hydrophobic barrier, at the center of the slide, with a PAP pen or nail polish.",
    "Allow it to air dry for a few minutes.\nCut an approximately 1 cm × 0.5 cm piece of double-sided adhesive tape using scissors.\nUtilizing forceps carefully place it on one of the long sides of the hydrophobic barrier created in step 8b.\nRemove the paper that protects the upper side of the tape, without touching the surface of the glass slide.\nTransfer selected embryos from the 1% agarose containing Petri to the dissection slide.\nUsing forceps, group 4 embryos and transfer them on the surface of the double-sided tape pasted on the dissection slide.\nCarefully disperse and orient the embryos on the double-sided adhesive tape by gently rolling them with the forceps.\nPlace embryos dorsal side up with their posterior tip pointing towards the center of the slide.\nUsing a plastic Pasteur pipette fill the area framed by the hydrophobic barrier with 0.1 M Sörensen buffer.\nEnsure that the embryos are fully covered by buffer.\nCritical: During this step, take special care to avoid buffer from overflowing the barrier or air bubbles from forming between the embryos and the double-sided adhesive tape.\nManually devitellinize the embryos on the slide.\nWith a pulled glass needle pierce the vitelline membrane and enter embryo in the space between the brain lobes.\nCritical: Steadily drag the needle towards the posterior tip of the embryo, at a flat angle.\nNote: It is important to perform the incision at the dorsal surface of the embryo, without disturbing ventral structures.\nWith the needle still in contact with the posterior part of the embryo, and while staying within the buffer volume, drag the embryo away from the vitelline membrane.\nNote: The vitelline membrane should remain stuck on the double-sided tape.\nGently, press down the embryo at the center of the slide and retract the needle.",
    "Dissect the embryos on the slide.\nComplete the incision initiated in step 10a to fully open the anterior and posterior tips of the embryo.\nCarefully, lift out the gut to reveal the VNC underneath it.\nNote: Steps 10 and 11 are repeated for all 4 embryos on the slide.\nComplete flat-preparation of dissected embryos.\nUsing forceps, break the fine tip of the glass needle to generate an opening of a diameter corresponding roughly to 1/3 of the embryo.\nAttach the blunt end of the needle to one end of a 0.5 m piece of Masterflex Tygon tubing.\nPlace a yellow tip at the free end of the Masterflex Tygon tubing.\nNote: The yellow tip serves as a mouthpiece.\nAdd 0.5 mL of 0.1 M Sörensen buffer to a 2 mL plastic tube.\nSubmerge the tip of the glass needle in the buffer.\nApply mouth suction to gently fill up the needle with buffer, until approximately 1/3 of its length is full.\nCritical: It is important to avoid forming air bubbles that could block the needle.\nWithout releasing pressure at the mouthpiece, remove through aspiration the guts and other debris from the preparation.\nNote: The buffer containing debris should never pass to the tubing.\nWhen approximately the full length of the needle is filled with buffer and embryonic material, blow out on a tissue paper to completely empty the needle.\nFill 2/3 of the glass needle with 0.1 M Sörensen buffer, similarly to step 12f.\nBlow a stream of buffer on each embryo to flatten it down.",
    "Critical: Be aware of the buffer level in the needle, since blowing air on the dissected embryos would destroy the preparation. Repeat as required. By the end of this step, the lateral epidermis should be attached to the slide surface and the VNC should be fully exposed, without nicks.\nNote: Step 12 could be performed employing a syringe. In this case a 1 mL syringe substitutes the mouthpiece at the free end of the tubing. Holding the syringe with the non-dominant hand, intend to control the level of buffer in the needle in order to gently aspirate embryonic debris and flatten dissected embryos, as described in steps 12g and 12j. This alternative is more challenging; mouth suction is preferred and the 0.5 m tubing length ensures no accidental liquid ingestion.\nExchange buffer in the preparation prior to AFM.\nUsing two p200 micropipettes gradually dispense fresh buffer on the preparation, while simultaneously removing the equivalent volume from it.\nRepeat step 13a at least three times, to ensure that buffer in the preparation is fresh.\nCritical: Irrespective of the efficiency in removing embryonic material and cellular debris by mouth suction in step 12g, it is important to exchange the buffer in the preparation before proceeding to the AFM. Avoid abrupt volume changes that could disturb the embryos and destroy the preparation.\nAFM measurements\nTiming: 30–45 min (per embryo)",
    "Below we describe the steps required for measuring the elastic moduli of the Drosophila embryonic VNC via nano-indentation, using a custom-built AFM (Rico Camps, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]). The AFM is coupled to an inverted microscope (Nikon TE2000) to allow for the correct tip localization at the measurement site of the embryo. The embryos can be visualized by phase contrast microscopy or by epi-fluorescence microscopy, in case fluorescent markers are expressed in the tissue of interest (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2206-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Scale bar is 30 μm.\n(B) Representative linear Voltage displacement curve (dotted line) measured when the AFM tip contacts the glass slide surface. A linear fit (red line) allows calculating the photosensitivity, s (1.08±0.05 V/nm).\n(C) Phase contrast images of a dissected Drosophila embryo indented with the AFM cantilever in central (left) and lateral positions. The VNC is false colored in pale blue and the midline in yellow. Scale bar is 30 μm.\nMount the AFM cantilever using the liquid AFM tip holder.\nPlace the dissected Drosophila embryos preparation (from step 13) on the AFM stage.\nIntroduce the AFM cantilever in the liquid and calibrate k using the thermal noise fluctuations method (Schillers et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]).\nNote: For calibration, the cantilever should be 200–300 μm away from the sample.\nDefine a clean (sample-free) area on the glass and approach the tip to engage with the surface.\nCalibrate the photosensitivity of the photodiode by contacting the tip against the glass surface.",
    "Note: A linear relationship (force - deflection curve) between the voltage measured with the AFM photodiode and the AFM tip displacement (V - displacement) needs to be observed since the tip will not deform the glass (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nPlace the tip on top of the Drosophila VNC and measure 5 force-curves per location at the midline or at lateral cortex regions (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Measure different points along the antero-posterior axis of the Drosophila VNC using an amplitude of 20 μm and velocity of 5 μm/s. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nNote: Low approaching speeds (< 5–10 μm/s) should be used for the measurement in order to minimize viscous cantilever friction with either the surrounding liquid or the intrinsic sample viscoelasticity.\nDiscard and/or repeat measurements, if the force curves show unclear approaches or retraction curves.\nRepeat the previous steps for the different Drosophila embryos.\nAFM data analysis\nTiming: 2 h per embryo\nFigure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] shows a representative force curve recorded from the embryonic VNC samples using the custom-built AFM in our lab and a spherical tip attached to a cantilever of k=0.01 N/m (Jorba et al., 2017b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). The non-linear shape of the curve is due to the increase of tip-sample contact area as indentation increases (Equation 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2206-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

    "Force recording. The force recorded when approaching the sample surface is zero until reaching surface contact, at the so-called contact point. From then on, F increases monotonically as sample indentation increases. The elastic properties of the sample are characterized by an effective Young’s modulus (E) computed by fitting a contact model according to tip-sample geometry. For a spherical probe indenting a flat surface of an elastic body the force curve is described by Hertz’s contact model (Johnson and Johnson, 1987[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Jorba et al., 2017b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\n   (Equation 3)   F =   4 ⋅ E ⋅  R  s p h   1 / 2     3  (  1 −  v 2   )     δ  3 / 2       \nWhere ν represents the Poisson’s ratio. Since ν is challenging to determine, biological samples like cells and tissues are considered incompressible materials (ν=0.5). The E is determined by fitting Equation 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd3] by setting the contact point as a fitting variable.\nCritical: The effect of indentation on E can be calculated by fitting the force curve with Hertz’s contact model using Equation 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd3] at different indentation depths (Gavara, 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Rico et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]). For the different embryo stages and positions we employed between 300 and 1,000 nm.\nNote: Commercial AFMs come with analysis software packages. The user can perform the analysis of the force curves using these packages. Alternative published scripts like Atomic J are available (Hermanowicz et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). In our case, an in-house MATLAB based software was utilized to calculate the effective Young’s modulus.\nPerform statistical analyses using any statistics software, in our case SigmaPlot 13.0 software (SigmaPlot Software). Data quantification procedures have been extensively detailed in previous studies (Jorba et al., 2017b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Rico et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17])."
