    "This study has been approved by the IACUC Committee at Indiana University School of Medicine.\n1. Generate Mice with Correct Genotypes\nEstablish a mouse model of BCCs. Mate K14-CreER mice (Jackson laboratory stock number 005107) with R26-SmoM2YFP mice (Jackson laboratory stock number 005130) (18) to generate K14-creER+ and R26-SmoM2YFP+ mice.\nPerform genotyping. Immerse tail specimens (0.5 cm long) in directPCR tail lysis solution with 1 mg/ml proteinase K at 55 °C overnight with shaking. The next day, remove tissue debris by centrifugation at top speed in a micro-centrifuge (to keep the supernatant for genotyping). Use 1 μl of the supernatant for each PCR reaction with the primers and conditions recommended by the vendor. Select the mice with the right genotypes (at age of 3-6 weeks, buprenorphine at 0.05-0.1 mg/kg will be applied via SQ every 8-12 hr  for 2-3 days after tail snip) for step 2.\n2. Induce Expression of SmoM2 in Skin Keratinocytes\nInduce SmoM2 expression in keratinocytes by oral administration of tamoxifen (5 μg/kg body weight in 50 ml of vegetable oil in each feeding) for 5 consecutive days via oral gavage with a feeding needle (curved 20 gauge).\n3. Preparing Skin Specimens\nIn general, phenotypes are more severe on the ear and the tail in K14creER/R26SmoM2GFP mice. To prepare for cell analyses, we first harvest the mouse skin after animal sacrifice with an institutional approved procedure (CO2 plus cervical dislocation).\n4. Isolating Epidermis\nAfter sacrifice mice with an approved procedure (see step 3), remove fur using a trimmer. Immerse skin specimens in dispase solution (5 mg/ml in DMEM with 10% FBS) at 37 °C for 1-2 hr (1 hr for mice less than 8 weeks old and 2 hr for mice old than 8 weeks).\nFollowing dispase treatment, separate epidermis from dermis by forceps.",
    "5. Generate Single Cells\nTo obtain single cell population, mince epidermis by scissors and then immerse in collagenase IV solution (1 mg/ml in DMEM with 10% FBS) for 1-2 hr at 37 °C in a 50 ml tube. Try to gently swirl the tubes every 20 min to help cell disassociation.\nInspect cell disassociation under microscope. When single cells can be detected in the collagenase medium, incubate the specimen for an additional 30 min to increase the cell yield. In general, the epidermis from one mouse can yield up to 107 cells.\nFilter the tissue mixture through cell strainer (pore size 70 μm), spin cells down at 1,500 rpm via bench top centrifugation, and wash once time with PBS.\n6. Label Cells and Perform Flow Cytometry Analyses\nResuspend the cells in 10% FBS in PBS at 2.5 x 106 cells/ml to block non-specific binding (on ice for 30 min)\nTake an aliquot of cells to each of 1.5 ml microtubes for specific antibody labeling. Add different antibodies to each tube at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. Mix antibodies with cells via a gentle vertex for several seconds and leave them on ice for 30 min, then wash with 1 ml PBS. For BCC specimens, we used the antibodies for following biomarkers: CD11b-PE plus Gr1-APC (myeloid cells or myeloid-derived suppressor cells); vimentin-FITC (fibroblast) (see reagents for details).\nFor intracellular staining, we use a kit and follow the vendor's manual (see Reagents for details). We use fresh cells to analyze cell surface markers. After surface marker staining, wash cells, and resuspend them in PBS. Add DAPI to the cell mixture at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. DAPI will stain dead cells that will be gated out from further analyses.",
    "Analyze the data with specific software. We first select single cells based on the FSC vs. SSC plot, and use DAPI negative population (live cells) for further analysis."
