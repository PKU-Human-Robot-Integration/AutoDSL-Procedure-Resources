    "K562 cells are used for the present study. This protocol has been optimized to work for 1 x 106-5 x 106 million cells. However, the procedure can be scaled up for larger cell quantities by increasing the volumes appropriately.\n1. Preparation of the 0.25x lysis buffer\nPrepare 0.25x lysis buffer by mixing the following components provided in Table 1A.\n\t​NOTE: Samples require approximately 300 μL of 0.25x lysis buffer. Recommended volume = number of samples x 300 μL.\n2. Separation of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions\nPellet the cells using 1.5 mL tubes via centrifugation for 5 min at 2000 x g (room temperature). Discard the supernatant using an aspirating pipette.\n\tNOTE: K562 cells were utilized during this protocol. However, the protocol can be adapted to various cell lines.\nResuspend the pellet in 300 μL of ice cold 0.25x lysis buffer.\n\tNOTE: Keep on ice for 2 min and rotate the tube every 45 s to ensure proper lysis of the cells.\nSpin the tubes at the highest speed (12,000 x g) at 4 °C for 2 min.\nAfter centrifugation, carefully remove the supernatant and place it in a new 1.5 mL tube. This will be the cytoplasmic fraction. Approximately 300 μL of the cytoplasmic fraction will be attained.\nThe remaining pellet will be the nuclear fraction. Add 500 μL of ice-cold PBS to the pellet and centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\n\t​NOTE: During this step, excess DNA gets removed.\n3. RNA clean-up using an RNA purification kit\nNOTE: This protocol was achieved utilizing a commercially available RNA purification kit (see Table of Materials).\nSeparate the cytoplasmic RNA samples and the nuclear cytoplasmic samples (as the fractionation steps vary between them).",
    "To separate the cytoplasmic fraction, add 1,050 µL of 3.5x RLT lysis buffer (see Table of Materials) and vortex briefly. Then, add 750 μL of 90% ethanol and load it onto the column from the RNA clean-up kit.\n\t\tNOTE: The solution must be well mixed prior to loading onto the column.\nTo separate the nuclear fraction, add 600 μL of 3.5x lysis buffer and vortex. Then, add 600 μL of 70% ethanol.\nLoad both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions onto RNA columns (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: For the remainder of step 3, both the cytoplasmic and nuclear samples follow the same procedure. However, ensure that these samples remain independent of each other.\n\t\nLoad both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions onto RNA columns and spin for 30 s at 8,000 x g at room temperature. Discard the excess flow through.\nAdd 350 μL of washing buffer from a commercially available purification kit (RW1 buffer, see Table of Materials), spin again, and discard the flow through.\nAdd DNAse solution (1U/uL) for 15 min at room temperature. Then, add 350 μL of washing buffer, spin again, and discard the flow through.\nAdd 500 μL of mild washing buffer (RPE, see Table of Materials), spin again, and discard the flow through. Add 500 μL of mild washing buffer, spin again, but only for 2 min.\nMove the column to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and add 30 μL of water to the spin column. Let the column sit for 1 min prior to spinning down.\n4. Validation of nuclear-cytoplasmic separation\nPerform cDNA synthesis\n\t\nOnce subcellular compartments of RNA have been extracted and purified, confirm the separation of the compartments using qPCR. To do this, first, convert the RNA into cDNA using a commercially available kit following the manufacturer's instructions (see Table of Materials).",
    "Prepare reverse transcriptase mastermix. Add template RNA. Incubate reactions in a thermocycler.\n\t\tNOTE: For random hexamers, the cycling parameters used are provided in Table 2A. Use the reverse transcriptase reaction immediately or store at -20 °C (Table 1B).\nPerform the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and analysis.\n\t\nDilute the cDNA synthesis with DEPC water (see Table of Materials) to have a final concentration of 20 ng/mL.\nUsing a PCR master mix, prepare the reaction for each sample using manual instructions as listed below.\nAcquire commercial probes necessary to detect cytoplasmic and nuclear fractionation. Use MALAT1 as the nuclear marker and TUG1 as the cytoplasmic marker (see Table of Materials).\n\t\tNOTE: Sequences for MALAT1 and TUG1 are provided in Table 3.\nCalculate each component's volume by multiplying each component by 3 for each of the technical replicates for the individual sample.\nFor each nuclear and cytoplasmic sample, acquire the following mixes for each: (a) Nuclear fraction with MALAT1, (b) Cytoplasmic fraction with MALAT1, (c) Nuclear fraction with TUG1, and (d) Cytoplasmic fraction with TUG1 (Table 1C).\nVortex briefly to mix solutions and transfer 20 μL of the mixture to each well of an optical reaction plate (see Table of Materials).\nCover the plate with a clear adhesive film utilized for qPCR (see Table of Materials) and centrifuge the plate briefly to eliminate air bubbles, and then spin the sample down at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nUsing design and analysis software (see Table of Materials), select the standard curve for the cycling parameters (Table 2B).\nUsing qPCR software, select Set up run (Supplementary Figure 1).\nOn the Data File Properties page, select Method and input cycle parameters from Table 2B (Supplementary Figure 2).",
    "After inputting cycle parameters, select the Plate tab, and input the samples to be run (Supplementary Figure 3). Select Start Run.\n\t\tNOTE: The steps described were performed in a qPCR machine using a commercially available master mix (see Table of Materials).\nPerform data analysis\n\t\nAfter the run is complete, create a data spreadsheet with the sample name, target name, and quantification cycle(Cq) (Supplementary Table 1).\nBegin with the MALAT1 samples to calculate the nuclear fraction. Subtract MALAT1 cytoplasmic fraction from the MALAT1 nuclear fraction (Table 4).\nThen, calculate the ΔCq (2^(-value)) (Table 5).\nContinue with the MALAT1 samples to calculate the cytoplasmic fraction, subtract MALAT1 nuclear fraction from MALAT1 cytoplasmic fraction, and then calculate the ΔCq (2^(-value)) (Table 6).\n\t\tNOTE: Looking at the ΔCq, it is observed that the nuclear MALAT1 fraction (green highlight) has a greater MALAT1 marker than the cytoplasm (red highlight), but now confirmation is required to ensure that the cytoplasmic fraction is predominantly cytoplasm and that the nuclear fraction does not contain cytoplasmic contamination.\nWith TUG1 samples, perform the same calculation as above (steps 4.3.2-4.3.4) (Table 7).\n\t\tNOTE: Looking at the ΔCq, it is observed that the cytoplasmic TUG1 fraction (green highlight) has a greater TUG1 marker than the nuclear fraction (red highlight), thus confirming good separation of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions (Table 8, Figure 1).\nSubscription Required.
