    "1. Preparation steps: 3D printing and soldering\nNOTE: The optical system described in this protocol is designed for a standard dry block heater.\nTo create the first configuration, 3D print the CAD files provided as Supplemental Files 1, 2, and 3 respectively:\nTo create the second configuration, 3D print the CAD files provided as Supplemental Files 3, 4, and 5, respectively:\n\tNOTE: These parts are designed to be printed with supports. In this guide, a black polycarbonate filament is used that can maintain its form after being subjected to temperatures up to 110 °C. In general, any material that can be heated to the temperature of the desired isothermal reaction without significant deformation can be used. To minimize the effect of internal reflections and ambient light interference, a material that is black or another dark color is recommended.\nPrepare the two light-to-digital sensor evaluation modules for parallel monitoring of two samples. On one of the sensor test boards, remove the R4 resistor, and solder a jumper wire from the right pad of the R4 area on the PCB to the top pad in the R1 area on the PCB. This will change the I2C address of the sensor, thus allowing simultaneous measurement of both sensors.\n\tNOTE: The sensor used consists of two PCBs: a USB adapter board and a sensor test board containing the light sensor; only the sensor test board is needed for this device.",
    "Solder wires to each of the two Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs). Connect a red wire (positive) to the pad labeled \"1\" on the LED and a black wire (negative) on the pad labeled \"2\" on the LED. Apply a thin layer of thermal adhesive on the back of the LED, place the LED on the top of an end cap, and wait until the thermal adhesive cures. On the other side of the end cap, add a heat sink.\n\tNOTE: When testing the LEDs before they are sealed in the enclosure, ensure to wear a proper blue light blocking eye protection.\nTo create the second configuration, cut two 1/4-inch diameter circles from a blue excitation foil sheet and four 1/4-inch diameter circles from a yellow emission foil sheet with scissors or a razor blade.\nPress an M2.5 hex shaped insert into each of the four holes on the slanted portion of the 'LCD_Screen_Holder.stl' part.\n2. Optical assembly\nPlace a 3/16-inch-long 4-40 threaded insert into the hole on the top of the 'Optics_Enclosure_Bottom.stl' part. Place a 1/4-inch-long 4-40 threaded insert into all other holes of the 3D printed part as shown in Figure 2A.\nInsert the sensor test board into the top cavity of the housing, with the five pins facing towards the top and closest to the center axis of the device. Secure with a 3/16-inch-long 4-40 screw through the hole on the sensor test board (Figure 2B).\nPlace one of the 20 mm focal length lenses in the section below the sensor test board with the convex side facing towards the bottom of the device and away from the test board (Figure 2C).",
    "To create the first configuration, place the long pass filter into the next section below the 20 mm focal length lens (Figure 2D) placed in the previous step. To create the second configuration, place two yellow emission filter foils into the section below the lens.\nTo create the first configuration, place the dichroic mirror into the diagonal section near the center of the encasement while observing the filter orientation specified by the manufacturer (Figure 2E). To create the second configuration, place the beam splitter into the diagonal section. No specific orientation is needed for the beam splitter.\nPlace a second 20 mm focal length lens into the section below the dichroic mirror (or beam splitter, depending on configuration) with the convex side pointing towards the top of the device (Figure 2F).\nTo create the first configuration, place the excitation filter in the section to the right of the dichroic mirror, making sure the arrow points towards the dichroic mirror (Figure 2G). To create the second configuration, place one blue excitation filter foil into the section to the right of the beam splitter.\nPlace the 15 mm focal length lens to the right of the excitation filter with the convex side facing the dichroic mirror (Figure 2H).\nPlace an LED into the remaining section of the print, with the LED facing towards the dichroic mirror (or beam splitter, depending on configuration). Ensure the two wires leading from the LED are inserted into the recessed channels so that the print will close tightly.\nRepeat steps 2.3-2.9 for the other side of the 3D printed part (Figure 2I).",
    "Close the empty side of the print on top of the print with the optical components by placing the extruded portions of the top half of the encasement into the recessed grooves of the bottom half of the encasement. Secure the two printed parts together with 3/8-inch-long 4-40 screws (Figure 2J).\n\t​NOTE: If the two printed parts are not completely closed, stray excitation light can escape from the optical housing. Ensure proper blue light blocking eye protection is worn until a proper seal is achieved. Reseal the enclosure until no excess light escapes.\n3. Electronics and touchscreen assembly\nConnect the two mini breadboards together, and then place the microcontroller onto one of the breadboards. Ensure that the microUSB port of the microcontroller faces outwards.\nTo connect LED modulation, connect the CTL pin of the LED (+) driver to a digital pin of the microcontroller and the LED (-) pin of the LED driver to a GND pin of the microcontroller.\nRemove the plastic covers on the back of the breadboards. Press the adhesive backing of the breadboards to the 3D printed part to attach the combined breadboards to the inside of the back portion of the 'LCD_Screen_Holder.stl' printed part.\nSecure the liquid crystal display (LCD) screen holder with the assembled breadboards inside to the optical enclosure assembled in section 2 with one-inch-long 4-40 screws.\nTo connect the LED power supply, connect the LED (+) pin of the LED driver to the positive wire of the first LED. Connect the negative wire of the first LED to the positive wire of the second LED on the breadboard. Connect the negative wire of the second LED to the LED (-) pin of the LED driver.\n\tNOTE: The order of first or second LED is arbitrary.",
    "To connect the LED driver power supply, connect the positive and negative wires of the 10 V power supply to the VIN+ and VIN- pins of the LED driver, respectively. (A barrel jack to two-pin adapter was used.)\nConnect the sensor test board power supply and data transfer. Only four pins on the sensor test board are used: the SCK, SDA, VDUT, and GND. Take a 4-pin female to male jumper wire and connect those pins on the light-to-digital sensor test boards to the mini breadboard through the gap in the top right of the LCD Holder print.\nOn the breadboard, ensure connections between the following are in place: the 3.3 V pin of the microcontroller and the VDUT pin of both test boards; the GND pin of the microcontroller and the GND pin of both test boards; the analog 4 (A4) pin of the microcontroller and the SDA pin of both test boards; and the analog 5 (A5) pin of the microcontroller and the SCK pin of both test boards.\n\tNOTE: Because I2C communication is used for the light sensors, the SCK and SDA pins of both sensors can both be routed to the same pins of the microcontroller.\nSecure the single-board computer onto the LCD Screen holder with four M2.5 screws. Ensure that the HDMI and power adapter ports of the single-board computer face upwards and the single-board computer is centered on the 3D printed part.\nConnect the touchscreen display to the single-board computer as per the touchscreen instructions, and then connect the HDMI port of the single-board computer to the touchscreen's HDMI port.\n4. Software installation",
    "Install and use the web editor to upload the custom sketch \"MiniFluorimeter_2Diode.ino\" provided in Supplemental Coding File 1 onto the microcontroller. Ensure the \"ClosedCube OPT3002\" library is installed using the Library Manager.\nChange the variable led_A_pin to the number of the digital pin used in step 3.3 (Electronics and touchscreen assembly section).\nAdjust the number of milliseconds the LED is turned on when acquiring fluorescence measurements by changing the value of the variable ExposureTime. Adjust the number of milliseconds between LED exposures by changing the value of the variable led_A_Interval.\nChange the variable led_Power to a number between zero and one to adjust the brightness of the LEDs during exposures. Zero gives the maximum amount of brightness and one gives the lowest amount of brightness.\nTurn on the ability to control the display via touchscreen by following the manufacturer's instructions provided with the 3.5-inch display.\n\tNOTE: If desired, the 3.5-inch screen can be used as a monitor without touchscreen capabilities, and a keyboard and mouse can be attached to the USB ports of the single-board computer for control of the single-board computer.\nDownload the \"MiniFluorimeter_2Diode_GUI.py\" file from Supplemental Coding File 2 to a desired location on the single-board computer.\nEnsure a working version of Python is installed on the single-board computer . Python 3.7 was used in the provided Python module, but any stable Python version could be used with appropriate changes to the provided script. Install the libraries needed for the Python program onto the single-board computer.\nChange the variable measurement_time to the length of time desired to take measurements. The program ends acquisition and closes after the desired time is elapsed. The GUI also allows acquisition to be ended through a button on the user interface.\nChange the variable serialPort to the serial address of the connected microcontroller.",
    "5. Recording real-time fluorescence data\nTurn on the commercial heat block and allow it to reach the desired temperature.\nPower the single-board computer with a standard 5 V power supply provided with most single-board computer purchases. Connect the single-board computer to the microcontroller with a microUSB to USB cable.\nUsing the touchscreen, open the provided Python script. Change the measurement_time and serialPort variables to the desired values. Change the variable outputFilepath to the name of the data file the program generates. Ensure the filename ends in '.xlsx'.\nPlace two PCR tubes containing the reactions to be monitored into the heat block. Ensure that the placement of the PCR tubes aligns with the optical channels of the fluorimeter once it is placed onto the heat block.\nPlace the fluorimeter atop the heat block with the PCR tubes centered between the four pegs extruding from each optical channel of the fluorimeter. For optimal measurements, ensure that the 3D printed fluorimeter is attached securely into the wells of the heat block.\nSecurely attach the fluorimeter, plug in the power supply adapter for the LEDs.\nUse the touchscreen to start the Python program. A graphical user interface (GUI) appears on the LCD screen and measures the real-time fluorescence.\nObserve the real-time fluorescence measurements over time for both PCR tubes that are shown to the user on the GUI.\nAfter the experiment time determined by the user has elapsed, acquisition ceases. View the measurements in the output data file saved in the user-defined location. To end the measurements early, click the button labeled \"Stop Acquisition\" on the user interface."
