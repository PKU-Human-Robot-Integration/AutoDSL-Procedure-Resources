    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nRapid bleach to synchronize animals for exposure\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step will synchronize animals in preparation for ethanol exposure. At this stage, the animals should be gravid adults and the plates should also contain hundreds of eggs (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3173-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Flowchart overview of exposure, maintenance, and nuclear dissociation\nWash gravid adults and eggs from plates set up during “animal synchronization[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.1]” step with 2–3 mL of M9 reused between 3 plates (e.g., wash plate 1 with M9, transfer M9+embryos to plate 2, repeat with plate 3) into a 15 mL tube. Ensure all animals and eggs are removed from the plates.\nCentrifuge at 3,000 g for 1 min and remove supernatant containing bacteria (some bacteria will be pelleted, this is normal).\nWash with 1 mL of M9 centrifuging at 3,000 g for 1 min to remove excess bacteria (optional but recommended).\nAfter the wash, aspirate down to the worm and egg pellet.\nAdd 1 mL of bleach solution (see “bleach solution[href=https://www.wicell.org#undtbl2]” for preparation) and vortex for 2 min.\nNote: Animal carcasses will still be visible in addition to eggs.\nCentrifuge at 3,000 g for 1 min, remove bleach solution taking care not to remove the pellet.\nAdd 1 mL of M9, vortex to mix and centrifuge at 3,000 g for 1 min (repeat 3 times).\nAfter the final wash, aspirate down to about 100 μL volume.\nMix vigorously with a 1,000 μL pipette and distribute eggs into a corner of an OP50 seeded NGM plate.\nNote: Each tube has enough eggs for multiple 60 mm NGM+OP50 plates. Ensure plates are not overcrowded, roughly 500 eggs per 60 mm NGM+OP50 plate.",
    "You will need 10 plates per condition for the exposure (e.g., if doing control, 0.05% ethanol, and 0.5% ethanol conditions, you will need 30 synchronized plates.)\nThese animals will reach the L4 stage in roughly 50–52 h at 20°C.\nEthanol exposure\nTiming: 48 h\nThis step describes a liquid culture ethanol exposure paradigm for snRNA-seq applications.\nLabel three 15 mL tubes as “1”, “2” and “3”.\nPlace 4 mL of M9 into each of the three tubes.\nWash plates containing L4 animals with M9 using a 1,000 μL pipette (use roughly 2 mL of M9 per 3–4 plates), being careful not to remove dead carcasses from the previous bleaching step, and place into tube “1”.\nAllow the animals to settle for around 5 min, then transfer the pellet (∼1 mL) into tube “2”.\nAllow the animals to settle again, and transfer into tube “3”.\nAllow animals to settle for around 5 min (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A), and divide each pellet evenly between two 15 mL tubes using a glass Pasteur pipette to prevent animals sticking (e.g., 2 pellets into four 15 mL tubes in total).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3173-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Liquid culture ethanol exposure setup\nWash L4 animals off of plates using M9 and place in 15 mL conical tubes, allowing to settle by gravity (A). The pellet is then evenly distributed among two 15 mL conical tubes and filled up to 10 mL with M9 + 10 mg/mL OP50 (B). Three 5 μL samples from each well mixed tube are taken to attain a worm count/tube (C). Each exposure condition is then added to its own 15 mL tube and placed on a rotator (D).\nTo each tube, add 1 mL of 100 mg/mL OP50 + M9, and fill with M9 to a final volume of 10 mL (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).",
    "Note: You should end up with a total of four 15 mL tubes containing animals in 10 mg/mL OP50 + M9.\nQuickly vortex each tube and take 5 μL of liquid placed onto a glass slide (average over 3 samples). Ensure that there is no more than an average of 4 worms per 5 μL sampled (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nNote: If the density is too high, dilute by adding additional 10 mg/mL OP50 + M9 until in the proper range. If the density is too low, allow the animals to settle and remove liquid, ensuring you have enough volume to expose all conditions.\nCritical: Animals at too high a density will starve.\nPrepare two 15 mL tubes per condition. In this case,\n2 tubes for Control: 10 mL worms in 10 mg/mL OP50 + M9.\n2 tubes 0.05% ethanol: 5 μL 100% ethanol + 10 mL worms in 10 mg/mL OP50 + M9.\n2 tubes 0.50% ethanol exposure: 50 μL 100% ethanol + 9.95 mL worms in 10 mg/mL OP50 + M9.\nCritical: Make dilutions of ethanol fresh at room temperature, do not store. Ethanol 200 proof should be stored sealed at room temperature only up to a month after opening.\nTo each 15 mL tube, add up to 5 mL of previously prepared worms in 10 mg/mL OP50 + M9 leaving room to add ethanol at the proper concentration.\nCritical: Ensure worms have not settled, as this will create an uneven distribution.\nRotate slowly (∼10 rotations/min) at 20°C for 24 h (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nPause point: Animals will incubate for 24 h.\nAfter 24 h\nNear a Bunsen burner open the tubes to aerate for 5 min.\nAdd 500 μL of 100 mg/mL OP50 + M9 into each tube to prevent starvation.",
    "Continue to rotate at 20°C for an additional 24 h (48 h total).\nPause point: Animals will incubate for 24 h.\nGravid bleach of exposed P0 for the F1 generation\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step will synchronize animals in preparation for nuclear isolation (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3173-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. C. elegans gravid adult bleach for post-exposure synchronization\nPost exposure animals washed off plates should be at a high density with animals easily visible (A). After bleaching, ensure that no bodies are present to ensure the tightest synchronization. Embryos should still be visible under a dissecting microscope (B).\nAfter removing 15 mL tubes from the rotator, allow animals to settle for 5 min.\nTransfer each pellet into a separate 1.5 mL tube (one tube per condition) with a low bind pipette or glass Pasteur pipette (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nNote: Make sure to keep each condition separate.\nWash with 1 mL M9 to remove excess bacteria, spinning tubes at 3,000 g for 1 min.\nAfter the wash, add 1 mL bleaching solution and vortex for 6–6.5 min. Eggs should be present, and bodies should be dissolved after beaching (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). The longer duration of the bleaching step helps manage the larger animal input.\nCritical: After bleaching, ensure carcasses are not present. Be careful not to bleach for too long as this will kill the eggs that are recovered.\nQuickly, wash 3 times with 1 mL M9. Spin at 3,000 g for 1 min after each wash.\nAfter the final wash, aspirate each tube to ∼200 μL and distribute onto fresh NGM plates (about 10 μL/ NGM + OP50 60 mm plate, ∼ 500 eggs).\nIncubate at 20°C until animals reach the L4 stage (approximately 50–52 h).\nNote: Each tube has enough eggs for multiple OP50 NGM plates. Ensure plates are not overcrowded.",
    "Note: If culturing worms to the F3 generation, some F1 plates from each condition will need to be put aside to obtain the F2 generation, and similarly, some F2 plates will need to be set aside to obtain the F3 generation.\nIf you are collecting F1 nuclei from JK560 animals:\nAfter roughly 50–52 h post bleach, place half of the L4 plates per condition at 25°C for 24 h prior to nuclei dissociation to prevent sperm production.\nOtherwise, keep bleached animals at 20°C until they are Day 1 adults.\nNote: Save the remaining half of the plates at 20°C until ready to proceed to “Step 31”.\nFiltering out F1 adults to synchronize F2 L1 animals (repeat for F3 L1s)\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step allows animals in the F2 generation to be synchronized without the need for a gravid adult bleach. This step can be repeated with the F2 adults and L1s to obtain a synchronized F3 population if necessary.\nFilter 7-10 60 mm plates per condition using a 10 μm filter in a sterile Swinnex filter holder, using M9 to wash the animals through into a 50 mL tube (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3173-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Filtering to isolate and synchronize L1 animals\nPrewet 40 μm filter to ensure proper position and function (A). Use a pipette to slowly filter animals washed off of plates with M9. Run through M9 will contain L1 animals in the 50 mL tube.\nWash animals from NGM plates with M9.\nNote: Visually inspect each plate to ensure L1s are present before washing off the animals.\nRun through 10 μm filter and follow with 3 times 1 mL M9 rinses into a 50 mL tube.\nOnly L1s will be washed through the filter.\nAllow L1s to settle (about 5 min).",
    "Place animals onto fresh OP50 NGM 60 mm plates, taking care not to overcrowd the plates (∼500 animals/plate, 10 plates per condition).\nWhen the F2 animals are egg laying adults (∼96 h, 20°C), with L1s visible on the plates repeat “Step 31” to obtain a synchronized F3 generation.\nNote: Ensure all conditions remain separate and when plating L1s ensure plates are not overcrowded.\nNote: Pre-wetting the filter with M9 will ensure the filter stays in the filter holder properly.\nNuclei dissociation\nTiming: 2 h\nAfter animals have been synchronized at the adult stage, the following steps will allow dissociation of individual nuclei from whole worms for downstream 10× Genomics sequencing.\nEnsure all reagents are prepared ahead of time (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3173-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Nuclear extraction setup\nEnsure that sufficient ice is available to keep all reagents cold. Ensure the environment is sterile and RNase free in a 4°C environment (A). Ensure that Modified FA buffer is not able to overflow from the Dounce tissue grinder and keep contents cold to preserve nuclei integrity (B). Add the worm pellet to the Dounce homogenizer (C) and homogenize the samples (D). Centrifuge the homogenized samples (E), the pellet (arrow) contains cellular debris. Finally, filter the supernatant through a Flowmi filter (F).\nCritical: Perform all centrifugation steps at 4°C. Perform all steps in RNase free conditions. Keep all samples and reagents on ice. Minimize pipetting and handling time to avoid nuclei lysis or clumping (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A–5F).\n1.2 mL per condition Modified FA Buffer (store on ice, use the same day).\n2.0 mL per condition of 1× PBS with 1% BSA and RNase inhibitor (store on ice, use the same day).\nClean, label with each condition, and pre-chill homogenizers at -20°C.",
    "Ensure all tubes are labeled and the 10× Genomics sequencing facility is ready to receive samples.

    "Deliver the samples for library preparation and sequencing as soon as possible to ensure the sample quality doesn’t degrade (here we used the 10× Genomics platform).\nData processing\nTiming: variable\nThis step will briefly outline the bioinformatic pipeline utilized to process raw 10× Genomics snRNA-seq data to remove low quality datapoints stemming from debris containing droplets and ambient RNA contamination (detailed version is available in Truong et al., 20231).\nResources to process raw snRNA-seq data.\nFirst, snRNA-seq raw reads were:\nDemultiplexed and aligned to the C. elegans ENSEMBL ce10 transcriptome utilizing Cell Ranger, using “include-introns” flag to align nucleus reads.\nSample quality control was determined through checking Cell Ranger reports such as: saturation, mapping rate and sample clustering.\nTo remove debris contamination and RNA contamination we utilized:\nDIEM to remove droplets with extranuclear contamination.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]\nSOUPx to identify ambient RNA and correct the expression reads for remaining droplets.12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]\nFilter out low-quality droplets (droplets with identified genes less than 300 or more than 3,500, UMIs more than 15,000 or mitochondrial reads more than 20%). Threshold should be determined based on visualization of QC plots.\nCanonical correction analysis (CCA) in Seurat v313[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13] was utilized to remove batch effect across samples.\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) and Louvain clustering14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14] were further used to identify clusters.\nWe recommend visualizing cell clusters with either t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) plot or Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). The former works better to identify different subpopulation within cluster and latter works better to identify distinct clusters.\nWe utilized known biomarkers (e.g., tra-2 for the germline, unc-25 for GABA neurons-specific markers; see Truong et al., 20231[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] Figure 2 and Supplementary Data S2) and used comparison and dot-heatmap visualization to determine cluster identity.",
