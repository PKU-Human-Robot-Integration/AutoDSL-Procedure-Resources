    "1. Large Fixture Attachment\nRemove standard fixtures from the machine.\nMove crosshead apart to accommodate the in-house fixture.\nPlace the aluminum block (part No. 1 in Figure 1A) on the machine and securely fasten on the machine using two bolts; the hole in the center accommodates the machine load cell.\nPlace the main fixture structure (part No. 2 in Figure 1B) on the aluminum block and securely attach it to the block using 4 bolts.\nPlace a four-ton jack under the part of fixture that does not rest on the aluminum block to support the fixture (Figure 1C).\nMount the 6-channel load cell fixture (part No. 3 in Figure 1D) on the main fixture and secure it using 6 screws.\n2. Crosshead Fixture Attachment\nSet the machine crosshead to absolute zero using crosshead lift control.\nAttach first baseplate (part No. 4 in Figure 2B) to the crosshead using 7 screws with its curved edges facing the front of the testing machine.\nAttach second baseplate (part No. 5 in Figure 2C) using one pivoting screw. The screw accommodates left and right bones during testing. The second baseplate (part No. 5) is free to swivel about the pivot screw relative to first baseplate (part No. 4). Orientation of the second baseplate determines if the setup is for right or left femur.\nAttach the assembly of the two slide bearings (part No. 6 in Figure 2D) to the second baseplate (part No. 5) using 4 screws (two screws can be accessed from one side of the first baseplate). Rotate the second baseplate in such a way that the second set of screws can be accessed from the top of the first baseplates.",
    "NOTE: To change the orientation of the slides from left bone to right bone, the 4 screws on top of the first baseplate are unfastened, and then slides are rotated about the pivot screw and fastened again at the required orientation.\nManually rotate the slides which are orthogonal to 6-channel load cell by setting the machine crosshead to relative position of 65°.\n3. Instrumented Fixture, High-speed Camera, and Lighting Setup for Experiment\nSet up the instrumented bottom fixture on a standard servo hydraulic testing machine. This fixture will hold the femur and accommodate both left and right femora in fall on the hip configuration (Figure 1).\nSet up high-speed camera and lighting equipment (Figure 3A-3D).\nPosition high intensity lights on tripods with one on each side of the machine and secure them (Figure 3A).\nSet up tripods for high-speed cameras on either side of the testing machine and connect each camera to data acquisition units (Figure 3B-3C).\nWith the cameras on and connected to the acquisition unit, configure camera settings; set frame rate to 6000 frames per second (fps) and resolution to 1,024 x 512 pixels; resolution can be reduced to accommodate camera internal memory (Figure 3D).\nSet shutter to 1 frame/sec (1/6,000 fps). Also set the camera option such that the recordings begin before the actuator moves (100 ms for fast tests and 200 ms for slow tests).\nConnect the synchronizing cable between the two cameras; select trigger mode in the software setting of the cameras.\n4. Checking/Calibrating Load Cells for Proper Data Acquisition System (DAQ)\nSetting up DAQ unit\nConnect the DAQ to the testing machine, high-speed video camera, load cells, and linear potentiometer as shown in wiring schematic in Figure 4.",
    "Check the proper connection of trochanteric load cell, head load cell, linear potentiometer, 6-channel load cell, and trigger signal to the DAQ device by observing data signal traces in the view panel of the DAQ software by manually pushing on the load cell.\nVerify that the DAQ, Signal Conditioner, and Pulse Generator are all powered ON.\nConfigure the DAQ software for all signals from the load cells and the linear potentiometer. In the DAQ software, select the \"Step setup >> Configuration\" tab and set up the acquisition rate (Hz) for each signal input associated with each load cell. On the \"Triggering\" tab, select the appropriate triggering option. Video equipment should also be triggered during trial runs to ensure video/DAQ system synchronicity.\nApply a nominal load (for example a minimum of 200 lbs to a maximum of 1600 lbs) to the femoral head and trochanter load cells using the standard servo hydraulic machine to verify reasonable load cell measurements and compare to manufacturer calibration data sheets (Figure 5A).\nSimilarly, apply static loads to the 6-channel load cell by using a dead weight as shown in Figure 5B. Check the functionality and verify the performance of the 6-channel load cell (Figure 5A-5B) by calculating percent differences between measured and theoretical force and moment values. The error should be less than 5%.\n\tNOTE: All load cells must have been calibrated by their manufacturer in advance. This step only checks that the load cells are functioning, all connections are made and the signals are reasonable.\nCalibrating the linear potentiometer\nSecure the linear potentiometer fixture to the crosshead and place the linear potentiometer in the fixture (Figure 5C). Tighten screws to lock the potentiometer body and plug the connector into the DAQ unit.",
    "Manually move the actuator (25 mm) on the load frame so that the potentiometer position translates from maximum compression to maximum extension and record displacements and the corresponding voltage (for at least three data points). Plot displacement vs. voltage and fit a linear function to the data (R2 >0.95). Input the slope of the linear equation (mm/V) as the calibration factor into the \"Scaling parameter\" box of the DAQ software.\nVerify the overall testing machine setup by testing a surrogate fiberglass bone to fracture to make sure all data acquisition is functional and reasonable. This includes trochanter load cell, femoral head load cell, linear potentiometer, the six-channel load cell, and the trigger signal (Figure 6).\n5. Preparing Bones for Testing\nThaw bones at room temperature for 24 h and remove moisture, excess fat, and any remaining soft tissue using paper towels.\nPlace bone in the acrylic scanning fixture, and prepare dental cement. Measure 60 g of PMMA powder and mix with 30 g of liquid resin under fume hood until the powder has dissolved. The mixture should be pourable. Use a disposable paper cup for this process. This step is for potting the greater trochanter in an aluminum cup (Figure 7A).\nAlign the aluminum cup below the trochanter. Then, pour PMMA cement to half the height of the cup, and raise the fixture platform to fit the bone into the cup. Allow 10-15 min for polymerization.\nWrap bones in saline soaked towels to avoid tissue dryness during bone cement polymerization.\nMove bone to the test fixture in the testing machine with aluminum cup attached to trochanter (Figure 7B)",
    "Center the aluminum cup on the plate attached to the trochanteric load cell and adjust slide bearings so that the aluminum cup slightly touches the load cell. Remove the pin from the fixture to allow for rotation of the fixture\nCenter and lower the crosshead for contact with the femoral head.\nReview setup, bone position, load cell signals, and cup position. Also review DAQ device; ensure that all the equipment and load cells are connected properly, and verify that all are powered on. Check software setup for proper signal response from each load cell.\nTake pictures of the femur placed in the fixture from 2 sides.\nSet the aperture to allow enough light onto the camera sensor and control the depth of field. Check image quality by focusing on the femoral neck. This process should prevent any glare and glossy bone regions in the image that would affect capturing the fracture event.\n6. Testing to Fracture\nVerify the servo mechanical load frame is programmed for appropriate displacement control of 25 mm for the fracture test in the servo mechanical load frame for both loading and unloading.\n\tNOTE: These are manufacturer specific settings and should be input and verified in the control panel of the testing equipment according to manufacturer specifications.\nVerify lighting to minimize reflections in the video cameras, and the data acquisition system one final time.\nClick on the start icon from the control panel to initiate test sequence to fracture test femur (Figure 7C).\nTake pictures of the fractured femur from 2 sides.\nManually retract actuator and remove femur from machine.\n7. Post-fracture Preparation\nRemove bone from fixture.\nTape proximal broken end of bone to shaft, wrap in wet towels and plastic bags (Figure 7D), and then freeze at -20 °C.",
    "Preserve the bones for further post-fracture X-ray and CT imaging.\n\tNOTE: Details for these processes have been previously explained in another protocol from our group (under review at JoVE) (Figure 7E).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
