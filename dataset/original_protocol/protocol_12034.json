    "Protocols given below have been standardized to test the effects of BPA exposure during early embryogenesis, and may be modified for use with BPS, BPF or other EDCs and toxicants on C. elegans embryos.\n1. Material Setup\nPrepare 500 mL of Nematode Growth Media (NGM)18 media by dissolving 1.5 g of NaCl, 1.25 g of peptone, and 8.5 g of agar in water to 500 mL. After autoclaving (121 °C, 15 PSI, 20 min), add 0.5 mL of cholesterol (5 mg/mL in ethanol), 0.5 mL of 1 M MgSO4, 0.5 mL of 1 M CaCl2 and 12.5 mL of 1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (108.3 g of KH2PO4, 35.6 g of K2HPO4, water to 1 L).\nPrepare hypochlorite solution by mixing 25 mL of 1 N KOH, 4 mL of bleach, and 71 mL of water. Make this solution fresh.\nPrepare M9 Buffer by mixing 3 g of KH2PO4, 6 g of Na2HPO4, 5 g of NaCl, 5 mL of 1 M of MgSO4, and water to 1 L.\nPrepare S Buffer18 by mixing 129 mL of 0.02 M K2HPO4, 871 mL of KH2PO4, and 5.85 g of NaCl.\nSterilize M9 and S buffers by autoclaving.\nGrow an overnight culture of Escherichia coli (OP 50 strain) in 20 mL of Luria Broth (LB).\nDissolve BPA in 10% ethanol to make a 1 mM stock solution. Make subsequent dilutions of 0.1 µM, 0.5 µM, 1 µM, 5 µM and 10 µM in S buffer.\n\tNOTE: Dilution in the aqueous S buffer greatly reduces the concentration of ethanol; for example, at the highest BPA concentration described in this protocol (10 µM), the concentration of ethanol is 0.1% v/v.\n2. C. elegans Culturing and Synchronization",
    "Pour the NGM media into 100 mm plates (about 25 mL/plate) and allow it to solidify. Once solidified, seed the plates by spreading 150 µL of E. coli OP50 from the liquid culture grown overnight. Incubate plates at 37 °C overnight.\nThe next day, transfer N2 worms onto the new plates by chunking an approximate slab of 1 cm square. Allow worms to grow for 3 days at 20 °C until the plate is populated with well-fed mature adults containing visible embryos.\nTo synchronize, wash each plate by pipetting up to 5 mL of M9 buffer across the plate. Transfer the liquid to a sterile 15 mL conical centrifuge tube.\n\tNOTE: Synchronization is done to kill adult worms and collect embryos that are relatively the same stage.\nCentrifuge at 3,000 x g for 4 min at room temperature in order to obtain a loose pellet of adult worms.\nUsing a 10 mL pipette, carefully remove the supernatant so as to leave the pellet intact. Add 5 mL of the hypochlorite solution and gently mix.\nCentrifuge at 3,000 x g at room temperature for 4 minutes.\nRemove supernatant with a 10 mL pipette and wash with 7 mL of M9 buffer. Repeat this step twice.\n3. Exposing Worms to BPA\nAfter the last wash from step 2.7 above, suspend about 100 µL of eggs with M9 buffer. Transfer about 50 µL of eggs to 2 mL microfuge tubes already containing the appropriate concentration BPA diluted in S buffer. Adjust the amount of S-buffer to ensure the correct final concentration of BPA (0.0 µM, 0.1 µM, 0.5 µM, 1.0 µM, 5.0 µM and 10 µM) per tube. Table 1 illustrates one way to make these dilutions.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nFor Final BPA Concentration,Stock BPA (100 μM),S Buffer,Synchronized Worms\n0.1 μM,1 μL,949 μL,50 μL",

Make the liquid OP50 E. coli culture as stated in 1.5 and seed the plates as stated in 2.1.\nLet the worms grow for 60 h in 20 °C. Examine plates every day for contamination. Contaminated NGM plates are usually discolored and accompanied by individual colonies. Check worms under the microscope for overcrowding. A lack of OP50 E. coli lawn and concentrated worms in small spots signify overcrowding.\n4. Anterior Touch Habituation Assay\nTransfer approximately 10 synchronized young adult worms to new unseeded NGM plates using a fire-sterilized 30 G platinum wire pick. Leave worms undisturbed for 5 min to allow them time to acclimatize to the new plate.\nFor the habituation response, use an eyebrow hair attached to the end of a wooden skewer or toothpick, and sterilize by dipping in 70% ethanol. Wipe with a clean lint-free tissue and wait for 1 min for ethanol to evaporate off. Gently touch the worm on the head (anterior of the pharyngeal bulb) using the eyebrow hair. Repeat the touches, allowing 10 s in between touches in order to allow the worm to recover.",
    "Continue to touch (allowing 10 s interstimulus intervals) until the worm no longer moves backwards. At this point, the worm has habituated to the stimulus. Record the number of touches required for the worm to habituate.\nAnalyze the difference between the mean habituation rates of the treated and untreated controls using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test.\n5. Worm Fecundity Assay\nTransfer individual L3 worms to a fresh and seeded plate using a platinum pick. Make sure that only one worm is placed per plate.\n\tNOTE: After the L3 larval stage, worms develop into L4 larval stage and adulthood. Picking them early is convenient in that they are large enough for the transfer of individual animals while ensuring that they have not already laid any eggs which otherwise would be missed in the count.\nCount the numbers of eggs laid every 12–24 h. After counting, transfer the parent worm to a new plate. Repeat until the worm stops laying eggs, typically after 5 days when incubated at 20 °C.\n\tNOTE: On average, a wild type worm can lay up to 300 eggs; therefore, transferring the parent to a new plate daily prevents overcrowding.\nAnalyze the difference between the average number of eggs laid by the treated and untreated controls using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test."
