    "This protocol was approved by the local ethics committee, and the experiments are in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (1964).\n1. Ethical Approval and Subject Instruction\nBefore starting the measurement, instruct all participants about the potential risk factors and the purpose of the study. Do not give information about the attentional foci, as this might affect the results. Ensure that the safety guidelines for the application of TMS in research settings 30 are followed.\n\tNOTE: When applying TMS, there are some medical risk factors, including implanted cranial electrodes and cochlear implants, personal history of syncope or seizure, epilepsy, cerebral lesion, drug/medication interactions, recent drug withdrawal, pregnancy, or illness. TMS should not be administered in children.\nIn the study, include healthy participants (n = 14) between 18 and 35 years old. Exclude subjects with any orthopedic and/or neurological/mental diseases. Ensure that all participants are right-handed.\n2. Experimental Design and Setup\nDivide the group in two. Instruct one half of the group on IF instructions first, followed by EF instructions in the second experimental session (see section 4.2.2 for the verbal instructions). Instruct the other half in a counterbalanced order.\n\tNOTE: The experiment consists of a total of four laboratory sessions (see Figure 1) that must be separated by a minimum of 72 h. The first two sessions consist of measuring the maximal force (Fmax) and the TTF of submaximal sustained index finger abduction (see step 4). The third and fourth sessions consist of measuring the activity of inhibitory circuits within the M1 during the task by means of subTMS and ppTMS (see Figure 1).\n3. Subject Preparation\nSeat the participant in an adjustable and comfortable chair throughout the whole experiment. Place a monitor 1 m in front of the participant.",
    "Place the left arm in a comfortable and relaxed position under the table, resting on the left leg. If needed, adjust the position of the arm with a pillow. Place the right arm of the subject in a custom-built splint in pronated position (see Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: Here, the splint is made of thermoplastic and fit all participants (for details, see16). In addition, the splint was conceived to restrict the degrees of freedom of the wrist joint (see Figure 2B). The only movements allowed were the abduction and adduction of the metacarpophalangeal joint of the index finger of the right hand.\nAlign the finger joint with the axis of rotation of the custom-made device. Once the optimal position is found, record manually and take a picture of the antero-posterior and medio-lateral positions of the splint to use comparable positions in sessions 2, 3, and 4.\n4. Sessions 1 and 2: Behavioral Tests\nMaximal isometric contractions (see Figure 1A).\nAlign the axes of rotation of the goniometer and the metacarpophalangeal joint and fix the goniometer properly using screws (see Figure 2). Place the force transducer in a way that allows for maximum voluntary contractions (see Figure 2B).\nConnect the EMG cable (FDI muscle), the force transducer, and the goniometer cables to the appropriate amplifier and/or analog to digital (A-D) converter.\nHave the participant perform 3 maximal isometric abductions of the index finger, with a 30-s break between each contraction, and determine the Fmax.",
    "NOTE: The Fmax is determined as the highest peak in the force signal obtained from the force transducer. Explain to the participant that maximal contractions consist of a gradual increase in force from 0 N to the individual maximum. Importantly, instruct participants to perform an isometric contraction against the stationary force transducer. Participants should abduct the index finger at the metacarpophalangeal joint and push as hard as possible against the force transducer. A 3-s time span should be given per contraction, and participants should be instructed to sustain the maximal force for 2 s16,25,26. Between each contraction, give the participants a 30-s break.\nHave the subject push the lever against the force transducer, without giving any instruction about the focus of attention.\n\t\tNOTE: The same task will be done at the beginning of session 2 to ensure that the Fmax and the position in the splint have not changed between sessions.\nAfter maximal contractions, remove the force transducer, allowing the index finger to move freely in the transverse plane (abduction/adduction).\nCalculate the Fmax from the maximal isometric abductions (step 4.1.3) using the raw data on the computer. Determine 30% (Fmax * 0.3; sessions 1 and 2) and 10% (Fmax * 0.1; sessions 3 and 4) of Fmax.\n\t\tNOTE: Consider the Fmax as the highest peak found in the force signal obtained from the force transducer. In the following sessions, the different contraction intensities (30% and 10%) will be calculated from the Fmax obtained at this stage of the experiment.\nFill a bottle of water to the amount representing the 30% of Fmax obtained from step 4.1.6. Attach the weight of Fmax to the rope of the device (see Figure 2A).",
    "NOTE: The volumetric mass density of water is 1 kg/L. Thus, if the 30% of Fmax of one participant represents 0.4 kg, adjust the weight of the bottle to the equivalent of 0.4 kg.\nSustained contractions until TTF (see Figure 1A).\nInstruct the participants about the task.\n\t\tNOTE: Participants must hold the finger in the target position by counteracting the weight (see Figure 2), performing an abduction of the index finger. The task must be performed until task failure. The task failure is determined as a deviation greater than 10 degrees from the target position. The deviation is measured by the goniometer and displayed on the monitor (see Figure 2B).\nRandomize the order of session (see step 2.1; EF or IF condition). Verbally instruct the participants on the adequate condition (IF or EF).\n\t\t\nFor the EF condition, instruct as follows: \"Concentrate on the position of the goniometer. Hold this position as long as possible. When the position of the goniometer changes, the thickness of the red line on the screen changes. Correct the position of the goniometer until the red line is thin again.\" Instruct the participant to \"control and concentrate on the position of the goniometer\" every 30 s.\nFor the IF condition, instruct as follows: \"Concentrate on the position of your finger. Hold this position as long as possible. When the position of your finger changes, the thickness of the red line on the screen changes. Correct the position of your finger until the red line is thin again.\" Instruct the participant to \"contract and concentrate on his finger muscles\" every 30 s.\nHave the participants hold the finger in the target position by counteracting the weight (see Figure 2), performing an abduction of the index finger. Have them perform the task until task failure.",
    "Press the \"record\" button on the recording software to start recording the goniometer signal and wait until task failure. Once task failure is reached, press the \"stop recording\" button on the recording software to stop the recording and save the goniometer signal on the computer. Remove the participant's hand from the orthopedic splint; the first session is now over.\nRespecting the minimum inter-session period (72 h), repeat steps 4.2.1-4.2.4. In addition, allow a minimum of a 72-h break between sessions 2 and 3 and sessions 3 and 4.\n5. Sessions 3 and 4: Brain Stimulation\nSurface electromyography (sEMG) recordings.\nShave the hair on the skin over the right FDI muscle, if needed, and then slightly abrade the skin using abrading gel. Disinfect the abraded area with a solution containing 80% ethanol and 1% glycerin. Allow the ethanol to evaporate.\nPlace the Ag/AgCl bipolar surface electrodes in a belly-tendon montage on the FDI, with 1-cm interelectrode distance. Place the reference electrode on the phalanx of the digitus medius.\nConnect the EMG cable (FDI muscle) and the goniometer cable to an EMG amplifier and to an A-D converter.\nUse Ag/AgCl bipolar surface electrodes to record and measure muscular activity and electrophysiological responses elicited by brain stimulation from the FDI muscle.\n\t\tNOTE: For the final analysis (subTMS-induced EMG suppression and peak-to-peak MEP amplitude), the EMG signal (from the FDI) must be adjusted as follows: amplification of x1000, Butterworth band-pass filtering of 10-1000 Hz, and sampling of 4 kHz. Store all EMG data on a computer for offline analysis.\nRepeat steps 3.1 and 3.2.\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation\nFix the reflective markers on the participant's forehead with double-sided adhesive tape.",
    "NOTE: Reflective markers allow for the constantly delivery of TMS to the target area over M1 by using a neuronavigation system (see Figure 2). The advantage of the neuronavigation system is that the coil position can be recorded relative to the skull position in space and be checked at any time throughout the entire experiment.\nUse a 95-mm focal figure of eight coils attached to a TMS stimulator to deliver stimuli to the contralateral motor cortical hand area.\n\t\tNOTE: Check that the stimulator allows for paired-pulse stimulation paradigms (session 4). In addition, the induced current must be directed posterior to anterior and must be delivered in reverse mode. The wave form should be monophasic.\nFind the optimal position (hot spot) of the coil relative to the skull for eliciting motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in the FDI muscle by performing a classical mapping procedure.\n\t\t\nStart by placing the coil approximately 0.5 cm anterior to the vertex and over the midline, with the coil handle pointing at 45° towards the contralateral forehead.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This will ensure that the induced current flow is approximately perpendicular to the central sulcus31.\nTo get the participants used to the TMS stimuli, start at intensities below 25% of maximum stimulator output (MSO). Then, start to increase the stimulation intensity and move the coil in the medio-lateral and rostro-frontal direction to discover the hot spot.\nOnce the hot spot is found, record the optimal position with the neuronavigation system.Determine the active motor threshold (aMT) by adjusting the intensity of the stimulator output. Define the aMT as the minimum intensity required to evoke MEP peak-to-peak amplitudes in the EMG of the FDI larger than 0.1 mV in three out of five consecutive trials21.\nSession 3: SubTMS-induced EMG suppression (see Figure 1B).",
    "Prepare the weight representing the 10% of Fmax by filling the bottle of water (see step 4.1.7).\n\t\tNOTE: The 10% of Fmax are selected based on the Fmax (the best of 3 trials) performed in step 4.1.3. In the subthreshold TMS protocol, only 10% of the Fmax has to be selected, as it has previously been shown that fatigue has an influence on subTMS-induced EMG suppression32,33. For the same reason, the subTMS session must be carried out on a separate session. The volume of water used here is between 0.3 L (smallest 30% of Fmax) and 1.2 L (biggest 30% of Fmax).\nInstruct participants about the task; the motor task consists of holding the index finger in the target position by counteracting the light weight of 10% (abduction of the index finger; the same task as in sessions 1 and 2, but with less weight).\nAs the participants remain relaxed in a comfortable position, find the optimal intensity for eliciting subTMS-EMG suppression, without giving any instruction about the focus of attention. To do this, successively diminish in steps of 2% MSO from the aMT determined previously.\nWhile they are still seated in the relaxed and comfortable position, have the participants perform two separate isometric index finger abductions at 10% of Fmax and record the EMG signal of the FDI. During this isometric index finger abduction, record (by pressing the \"record\" button on the recording software) 20 trials with and 20 trials without TMS, with a randomized interstimulus interval (ISIs) ranging from 0.8 to 1.1 s16,25,26,33,34 in a 100-ms time window.\n\t\tNOTE: This interval ensures that participants do not have to perform the motor task for too long and therefore minimizes fatiguing effects. After each series, check the subTMS-induced EMG suppression.",
    "Apply a full-wave rectification by converting all negative amplitudes to positive amplitudes in the EMG signals. Average the EMG signals using time-normalized averaging35.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The onset of subTMS-EMG suppression is defined as the moment when the difference between the trials with and those without TMS is negative for at least 4 ms in a time window from 20 to 50 ms after the TMS: EMGDiff = EMGWithout- EMGWith.\nRepeat step 5.4.3 until the optimal stimulation intensity is found, indicated by the largest EMG suppression.\n\t\tNOTE: The optimal intensity is found at around 80% of aMT16.\nGive the participant the adequate instructions (see step 4.2.2) regarding the condition (IF or EF). Repeat the instructions before each series (step 4.2.2).\nWhile they remain seated in the relaxed and comfortable position, have the participants perform four separate isometric index finger abductions (2 times with each focus: EF and IF) at 10% of Fmax and record the EMG signal of the FDI.\n\t\t\nDuring this isometric index finger abduction, record (by pressing the \"record\" button on the recording software) 40 trials with and 40 trials without TMS, with randomized ISIs for each condition (i.e., IF and EF) in a counterbalanced order. Use the same intensity for each condition (determined in point 5.4.5).\nBetween each series, allow a break of a minimum of 5 min to minimize any bias that may be induced by fatigue.\nSession 4: ppTMS (see Figure 1B).\n\tNOTE: The paired-pulse paradigm is composed of a conditioning stimulus at 0.8 aMT, followed by a suprathreshold control stimulus at 1.2 aMT.",
    "Repeat steps 5.1-5.4. In brief, place EMG electrodes over the FDI muscle, seat the participant in an adjustable and comfortable chair, and place the left arm in a comfortable and relaxed position under the table (i.e., on the left leg). Find the hotspot for TMS over the M1.\nSet the intensity on the stimulator, the ISI at 2.5 ms36, and the interval between paired and single-pulse TMS at 0.25 Hz.\nGive the participant adequate instructions (see step 4.2.2) regarding the condition (i.e. IF or EF). Repeat the instructions before each series.\nHave the participants perform four separate isometric index finger abductions (2 times with each focus: EF and IF) at 10% of Fmax and record the EMG signal of the FDI. During the isometric contraction, record 20 TMS stimuli for each condition (i.e., IF and EF) in a counterbalanced order.\n\t\tNOTE: One set of 20 stimuli must be composed of 10 conditioned MEPs (paired-pulse at 0.8-1.2 aMT) and 10 control MEPs (single-pulse at 1.2 aMT). Use the same intensity for each condition (determined in step 5.5.2).\nBetween each series, allow a break of a minimum of 5 min to minimize any bias that may be induced by fatigue.\n6. Data Processing and Analysis\nSubTMS.\nAs explained above (step 5.1.1.3), rectify and average the EMG for analysis.\nDetect the onset of subTMS-EMG suppression (see Figure 4).\n\t\tNOTE: It is defined as the moment when the difference between the average of all trials with and those without TMS is negative for at least 4 ms in a time window from 20-50 ms after the TMS.",
    "To detect the end of subTMS-EMG suppression, define the moment after the onset of suppression (step 6.1.2) when the difference between the average of all trials with and those without TMS is positive again for at least 4 ms (see Figure 4a).\nCalculate the subTMS-induced EMG as follows:\n\t\tEMGDiff = EMGWithout – EMGWith.\n\t\t\nCompute the cumulative trapezoidal numerical integration from the onset to the end of the suppression to quantify the amount of subTMS-induced EMG suppression.\nppTMS.\nUse the following formula to express the magnitude of SICI as a percentage relating to the control MEP:\n\t\t100 – (conditioned MEP/control MEP × 100).\n\t\t\nUse the results as percentage values for the final analysis.\nCalculate peak-to-peak MEP amplitudes (in mV; in the EF and IF conditions) and compare the two conditions in the final analysis.\nEMG.\nAs background EMG has an influence on the magnitude of MEPs37, determine the EMG activity by computing the root-mean-square value in a 100-ms window before the TMS.\nSubscription Required.
