    "Human blood samples (LRSC) from healthy, de-identified donors were obtained from EFS (French National Blood Service) as part of an authorized protocol (CODECOH DC-2018–3114). Donors gave signed consent for the use of blood.\n1. Media and Buffer Preparation\nPrepare the macrophage medium [RPMI glutamax + 10 mM HEPES + 1x non-essential amino acids (NEAA)] and warm it to 37 °C.\nPrepare the macrophage medium + 10% human serum from AB plasma (SAB), filter it (0.22 µm filter), then warm it to 37 °C (referred to as macrophage medium + 10% SAB hereafter).\nPrepare the sorting buffer [1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) + 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) + 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)], filter it (0.22 µm filter), and maintain it at 4 °C.\n2. Isolation of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) from Leukoreduction System Chamber (LRSC)\nPut 15 mL of density gradient cell separation solution (see Table of Materials) in a 50 mL centrifugation tube so it can warm to room temperature (RT) before receiving the LRSC.\n\tNOTE: Density depends on temperature. As this product is stored at 4 °C, this step must be done in advance so it can equilibrate to RT.\nEmpty the LRSC into a 50 mL centrifugation tube, add up to 50 mL of 1x PBS, and mix. Very slowly, add 25 mL of the mix prepared during step 2.2 on top of 15 mL of density gradient solution warmed up during step 2.1.\n\tNOTE: Be careful not to mix the phases during this step. The blood must be added on the density gradient solution without any disturbance of this phase.\nCentrifuge both centrifugation tubes for 25 min at 700 x g without breaks.",
    "NOTE: At the end of the density gradient centrifugation, the layers from bottom to top are: the erythrocytes and granulocytes forming the pellet, density gradient solution phase, layer of PBMCs, and plasma.\nWith a pipet, pass through the plasma phase without aspirating it and collect the PBMC layer into a new 50 mL centrifugation tube. Add up to 50 mL of 1x PBS to the PBMCs as a washing step and centrifuge for 10 min at 300 x g.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 40 mL of macrophage medium.\n3. Magnetic Labeling and Isolation of CD14+ Cells (Monocytes)\nCount the PBMCs in a Malassez chamber. Withdraw the amount of PBMCs necessary for conducting the experiment (typically 100 to 300 x 106 cells), place them in a centrifugation tube, and centrifuge for 10 min at 300 x g.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 80 µL of the sorting buffer prepared during step 1.3 per 107 PBMCs. Add 20 µL of CD14 microbeads per 107 PBMCs. Mix well and incubate for 15 min at 4 °C under constant agitation.\nAdd 1 mL of sorting buffer per 107 PBMCs as a washing step and centrifuge for 10 min at 300 x g. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 500 µL of sorting buffer per 108 PBMCs.\nPlace a column in the magnetic field of the separator. Prepare the column by rinsing it with 3 mL of sorting buffer.\nApply the cell suspension onto the column. The column depends on the number of cells to be isolated (here, LS columns for up to 109 PBMCs are used). Collect flow-through containing unlabeled cells.\n\tNOTE: Starting at this step, all the tubes (negative and positive selections) are kept for later checking of the different steps by flow cytometry.",
    "Wash the column with 3 x 3 mL of sorting buffer. Collect unlabeled cells passing through the same tube from step 3.12. Perform washing steps by adding sorting buffer, be careful not to dry your column. Place a collection tube under the column and remove it from the separator.\nPipette 5 mL of sorting buffer into the column. Immediately flush out the magnetically labeled cells by firmly pushing the plunger into the column. To increase purity of the CD14+ cells, the eluted fraction is enriched over a second column.\nRepeat steps 3.4 to 3.7 with a new column.\n4. Plating of Monocytes\nCount the monocytes in a Malassez chamber. Check the purity of the CD14+ cells by flow cytometry. Withdraw the amount of monocytes necessary for the experiment and place them in a centrifugation tube.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 300 x g. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the monocyte pellet in macrophage medium. Plate the cells and let them settle for 50 min to 1 h. Aspirate the medium and replace it with macrophage medium + 10% SAB + 25 ng/mL macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) to induce differentiation.\n5. Polarization of Macrophages at Day 6\nAspirate the medium. Replace it with macrophage medium + 10% SAB with various stimuli. For example, add 10 ng/mL interferon gamma (INFγ) + 1 ng/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to obtain M1 polarization, or 20 ng/mL interleukin 4 (IL4) + 20 ng/mL interleukin 13 (IL13) for M2 polarization.\n\tNOTE: The stimulation can be performed between 24 and 48 h before proceeding to other tests.\nHarvest cells using a detaching solution or a cell scraper.\n6. Cell Culture Under Low Oxygen Conditions",
    "Starting from step 4, maintain the monocytes and then macrophages in an oxygen-controlled environment to perform hypoxic condition analysis. Use a hypoxia working station in order to maintain cells under the desired oxygen partial pressure during the experiment.\n\tNOTE: When working under low oxygen pressure, it is important to prepare all media and washing buffers under the station and wait sufficiently to obtain the correct partial pressure in the liquid. For example, 10 mL of PBS in a 60 mm Petri dish requires roughly 2 h to reach 25 mmHg for O2 partial pressure starting from atmospheric pressures (as we have measured it using a fiber-optic oxygen sensor). In many hypoxic stations or incubators, the oxygen pressure is set as a percentage of the atmospheric pressure. If precise measurements are necessary, it is better to use a station authorizing to directly set the oxygen pressure in mmHg.\n7. Lysis and In-Gel Digestion (Protocol 1)\nNOTE: In this and the following sections, two protocols used to obtain peptides and perform LC-MS/MS analysis are described. Protocol 1 describes cell lysis and in-gel fractionation and digestion, and protocol 2 describes in-solution cell lysis followed by in-solution digestion and fractionation using an isoelectric focusing method.\nPerform cell lysis in Laemmli buffer [234 mM Tris-HCL (pH 6.8), 7.5% SDS, 37% glycerol, 33.3% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, bromophenol blue 0.2% w/v]. Load the protein equivalent of 300,000 cells for each sample on 4-12% bis-Tris acrylamide gels.\nControl the duration of the electrophoretic migration to allow each protein sample to be split into 6 gel bands as exemplified in Figure 3.",
    "Fix the gel with a fixing solution (30% ethanol + 7.5% acetic acid for 20 min), then add the staining solution (R-250 Coomassie blue for 45 min). Add the destaining solution (30% ethanol + 7.5% acetic until bands appear) before excising the protein bands with a clean scalpel.\nDice each excised band before introduction in 500 µL tubes. A clean glass surface is warranted to avoid contamination with keratins (5% SDS solution in deionized water can be used to clean surfaces).\nWash the gel slices 3 times in 200 µL of 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 20 min at 37 °C, followed by one wash in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile (50% v/v). Dehydrate the gel pieces with 200 µL of 100% acetonitrile for 10 min.\nIncubate each gel piece with 10 mM DTT (dithiothreitol) in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 45 min at 56 °C (200 µL), followed by 55 mM iodoacetamide in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate (200 µL) for 35 min in the dark at RT.\nTo stop alkylation, incubate each gel piece with 200 µL of 10 mM DTT in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 10 min at RT. Wash the gel pieces in 200 µL of 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate, then dehydrate with 200 µL of 100% acetonitrile for 10 min.\nDigest the proteins overnight at 37 °C with Trypsin/Lys-C mix according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nExtract the resulting peptides from gel pieces by adding 50 μL of 50% acetonitrile for 15 min, then 50 μL of 5% formic acid for 15 min, and finally, 50 μL of 100% acetonitrile for 15 min. Pool and dry each fraction in low-absorption tubes to limit adsorption of peptides and sample loss. Store the samples at -80 °C until further analysis.",
    "8. Protein Extraction and In-Solution Digestion (Protocol 2)\nPerform cell lysis (2 x 106 cells) with 150 µL of the following lysis buffer:\n\t\n7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 40 mM Tris, and 4% CHAPS, supplemented with protease inhibitors (complete mini, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail).\nHomogenize the solutions for 30 min at RT with a thermoshaker. Centrifuge at 13,800 x g for 20 min RT and keep the supernatant.\nRemove contaminants with a 2D clean-up kit:\n\t\nThe kit contains precipitant solution, co-precipitant solution, wash buffer, and wash additive.\nAdd 300 µL of precipitant solution and mix well. Incubate on ice for 15 min. Add 300 µL of co-precipitant solution. Centrifuge the tubes (at least) at 12,000 x g for 5 min. A small pellet should be visible. Proceed rapidly to the next step to avoid resuspension or dispersion of the pellet. Remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.\nCentrifuge the tubes again with the cap-hinge and pellet facing outward to bring any remaining liquid to the bottom of the tube. A brief pulse is sufficient. There should be no visible liquid remaining in the tubes.\nWithout disturbing the pellet, add 40 µL of co-precipitant solution. Let the tube sit on ice for 5 min. Centrifuge for 5 min, then remove and discard the wash. Add 25 µL of de-ionized water. Vortex each tube for 5-10 s. The pellet should disperse but not dissolve in the water.\nAdd 1 mL of wash buffer (pre-chilled for at least 1 h at -20°C) and 5 µL of wash additive. Vortex until the pellet is fully dispersed. Incubate the tubes at -20°C for at least 30 min. Vortex for 20-30 s every 10 min\n\t\tNOTE: The tubes can be stored at -20°C for up to 1 week with minimal protein degradation or modification.",
    "Centrifuge the tubes (at least) at 12,000 × g for 5 min. Carefully remove and discard the supernatant. A white pellet should be visible. Allow the pellet to airdry for no more than 5 min (if the pellet is too dry, it will be difficult to resuspend).\nResuspend the protein pellet in 300 µL of 8 M urea and 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate. Vortex strongly for 1 min. Determine the protein concentration using a colorimetric assay.\n9. In-Solution Digestion (Protocol 2)\nReduce disulfide bridges by adding 5.1 µL of a 700 mM DTT aqueous solution (final concentration 12.5 mM) to the resuspended proteins from step 8.4 and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min with a thermoshaker. Alkylate cysteine residues by adding 20.3 µL of a 700 mM iodoacetamide aqueous solution (final concentration 40 mM) and incubating at 25°C for 30 min in the dark with a thermoshaker.\nAdd 990 µL of 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate to the sample. Add a corresponding volume of Trypsin/Lys-C mix (enzyme:substrate ratio 1:100 w/w). Incubate at 37°C overnight with a thermoshaker.\n10. Clean-up Cartridge (Protocol 2)\nWet a cartridge with 1 column-volume (1 mL) of methanol. Clean the cartridge with 1 column-volume (1 mL) of 80% acetonitrile/HPLC-grade water and discard the flow-through. Equilibrate the cartridge with 4 column-volumes (4 mL) of 0.1% formic acid/HPLC-grade water and discard the flow-through.\nAcidify samples with 90 µL of 10% formic acid or water to pH 2-3 (check the pH with a pH indicator). Load the acidified samples and collect the flow-through. Reload the flow-through (containing the not-retained peptides). Wash the cartridge with 6 column-volume (6 mL) of 0.1% formic acid/HPLC-grade water.",
    "Elute peptides from the cartridge with 1 column-volumes (1 mL) of 0.1% formic acid/50% acetonitrile/HPLC-grade water. Transfer to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Concentrate the sample using a vacuum concentrator (150 x g, vacuum at 160 mBar).\n11. Fractionation by Isoelectric Focusing (Protocol 2)\nNOTE: Peptides are separated according to their isoelectric points using an off-gel fractionator on a 13 cm strip covering a pH range from 3 to 10. We used the following protocol provided by the supplier (summarized below):\nPrepare the following solutions: solution A (600 µL of glycerol solution, 60 µL of OFFGEL buffer, 4.34 mL of ultrapure water) and solution B (1.776 mL of solution A and 444 µL of ultrapure water).\nAssemble the IPG strips, frames, and electrodes according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nResuspend the sample with 1.8 mL of solution B. Add 40 µL of solution B into each well. Load 150 µL of sample into each well.\nSelect the default method for peptides: OG12PE00 (OFFGEL default method for peptides for use with a 3100 OFFGEL Low Res Kit, pH 3-10, 12-well frames. Wait until this method has been completed (~20 h). Collect the fractions in properly labeled tubes.\n12. Clean-up Harvard Apparatus Column Reverse C18 Post-IEF (Protocol 2)\nProgressively add a few μL at a time of 1% TFA in de-ionized water to each fraction to acidify the sample. Check using pH paper that the pH is about 3 or below.\nPrepare the following solutions: solution 1 (5 mL of acetonitrile, 10 µL of formic acid, 4.99 mL of ultrapure water) and solution 2 (0.5 mL of acetonitrile, 10 µL of formic acid, 9.49 mL of ultrapure water).",
    "Pre-wet the spin column with 150 µL of solution 1. Centrifuge for 90 s at 750 x g and discard the flow-through. Wash the spin column with 150 μL of solution 2. Centrifuge for 90 s at 750 x g and discard the flow-through.\nPass the fraction through the column. Centrifuge for 90 s at 750 x g and discard the flow-through. Wash with 150 μL of solution 2. Centrifuge for 90 s at 750 x g and discard the flow-through.\nElute the fraction with 50 μL of solution 1. Centrifuge for 90 s at 750 x g. Repeat these steps once more.\nDry-fraction using a vacuum concentrator (150 x g, vacuum 160 mBar) and store at -80°C\n13. Analysis of Proteomic Data and Bioinformatics18\nAnalyze data obtained by a nano-LC MS/MS mass spectrometer using quantification software such as MaxQuant (version 1.5.2.8) and the Andromeda search engine.\nSet false discovery rate (FDR) to 1% for both proteins and peptides and a minimum length of 7 amino acids. Set enzyme specificity as C-terminal to Arg and Lys. Allow 2 missed cleavages at proline bonds. Select carbamidomethylation of cysteine as a fixed modification and N-terminal protein acetylation and methionine oxidation as variable modifications.\nFurther analyze the data with statistical analysis software. Perform a functional enrichment analysis using FunRich software (www.funrich.org/).
