    "The in vivo experiment was conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals prepared by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Research. The experiment was approved by the local Animal Experiments Committee.\n1. Preparation of Injectable and Embedding Solution\nPrepare the injectable gel.\n\t\nPrepare 1 mL of ureido-pyrimidinone (UPy) gel in accordance to previously-described protocols12,13.\nAdd superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (SPIOs) to the solution to get a concentration of 15 µg/mL and stir the mixture for 5 min for uniform distribution.\nAdd the fluorescent microbeads to the solution to get a concentration of 10,000 beads/mL and stir the mixture for 5 min for uniform distribution.\nStore the resulting mixture at room temperature in a dark environment. Warm and vortex or stir the solution shortly before the injection procedure.\nPrepare the embedding solution.\n\t\nStart with tap water at room temperature and add agarose (agar) to a concentration of 4 wt%.\nSlowly heat up the solution to the boiling point using a microwave oven and stir frequently during heating. Upon reaching the boiling point, store and keep the agar solution above 70 °C for 2 h to allow trapped air to surface.\nAllow the agar to cool down at room temperature to a temperature between 50 and 60 °C until the time of embedding.\n2. Injection Procedure\nPerform premedication (anti-arrhythmic agents, anti-platelet therapy, and pain medication), anesthesia, venous access, and intubation, as previously described14.\nPerform injections using an intramyocardial injection catheter (Table of Materials). For each injection, 0.2 mL of the mixture is injected in one bolus at a constant rate of approximately 0.3 mL/min using an injection device. Place the injections at different positions along the IBZ12.\nAdminister 0.2 mL/kg (1.0 mmol/mL) of a gadolinium-based contrast agent 15 min prior to euthanizing the animal.",
    "Administer 20 mL of 7.5% potassium chloride intravenously to euthanize the animal.\nSecure mediastinal access following protocol steps 8.2 - 8.3, as described by Koudstaal et al.14. Cut the inferior caval vein 5 cm from the right atrium and remove outflowing blood with a suction device. Excise the heart and rinse it with 0.9% saline at room temperature.\n3. Embedding Procedure\nPrepare the heart.\n\t\nRemove the pericardium from the heart while keeping the atria and ventricles intact. Dissect the ascending aorta ± 1 cm above the aortic valve using Klinkenberg scissors. Cut the inferior caval vein ± 1 cm from the atrium, and do the same for the pulmonary veins.\nSuture the apex of the heart to the bottom of a plastic embedding container (17 x 15 x 15 cm, W x D x H) using a 2-0 suture to prevent floatation of the heart during embedding (Figure 1A).\nSuture the remaining part of the aorta to the rims of the container using 2-0, making sure that the heart is centered and not touching the walls of the container (Figure 1B).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54974/54974fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Schematic Overview and Photograph of the Embedding Container. (A) Schematic overview of the embedding process. The heart (red) is secured in the container (blue) using sutures. After filling the heart with the agar solution, the space around the heart is filled. Finally, two rigid plastic tubes (yellow) are positioned in the container, next to but not touching the heart, to serve as a reference during image registration.

    "NOTE: The prevention of air bubble creation is necessary. If large air bubbles present in the agar solution, keep the agar at 40 °C, allowing the air bubbles to surface.\n\t\nClamp the inferior caval vein using mosquito clamps. Slowly inject the liquid agar using a 50-mL syringe in the right atrium via the superior caval vein until both the right atrium and ventricle are completely filled.\nClamp the pulmonary veins using mosquito clamps. Gently pass an agar-filled 50-mL syringe retrogradely through the aortic valves. Slowly inject the solution in the left ventricle (LV) until the LV and the left atrium are completely filled. After filling the LV, clamp the aorta to keep the agar in the LV.\nPour the remaining agar into the container until the heart is fully covered. Place two rigid plastic tubes within the embedding container to serve as reference structures for later image registration (Figure 1A). Make sure the tubes do not touch the walls of the container or the heart.\nLet the agar solidify at 2 - 7 °C.\n4. Image Acquisition\nPerform transversal ex vivo MRI scans of the heart that is embedded in the container.\n\t\nPlace the container with the embedded heart inside a head coil (Table of Materials).\nAngulate the slices parallel to the bottom of the container. Use the same orientation and angulation in each ex vivo MRI sequence.\nTo visualize myocardium, perform a fluid-attenuated inverse recovery (FLAIR) sequence with the following parameters: repetition time [TR]/echo time [TE] = 10 s/140 ms, flip angle = 90°, pixel size = 0.5 x 0.5 mm, field of view [FOV] = 169 x 169 mm, 320 x 320 matrix, and 3-mm slice thickness.",
    "To visualize the myocardial infarction, perform a late-gadolinium enhanced (LGE) sequence with the following parameters: [TR]/[TE] = 5.53 ms/1.69 ms, flip angle = 25°, pixel size = 1.0 x 1.0 mm, [FOV] = 169 x 169 mm, 176 x 176 matrix, and 3-mm slice thickness.\nTo visualize SPIOs, perform a T2*-weighted gradient echo sequence with the following parameters: [TR]/[TE] = 88.7 ms/15 equally-distributed TEs with a range of 1.9 - 24.6 ms, flip angle = 15°, pixel size = 0.5 x 0.5 mm, [FOV] = 169 x 169 mm, 320 x 320 matrix, and 3-mm slice thickness.\nTissue processing\n\t\nTurn the container upside down and allow air between the agar and the sides of the container to remove the solid agar solution, including the heart, from the container. Remove the plastic rods from the solid agar.\nSection the agar block containing the heart in 5-mm slices from the apex to the base of the heart using a meat slicer. Keep the angulation of the cut slices the same as in the acquired MR images by cutting parallel to the bottom of the agar block.\nStain the agar slices (including the heart) for 15 min in 1 wt% of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazoliumchloride (TTC) dissolved in 0.9% saline at 37 °C, and photograph the slices on both sides from a perpendicular view (Figure 2A). Next, carefully rinse the slices in 0.9% saline.\n\t\tNOTE: In this study, we used a dSLR setup with an appropriate lens/objective, a tripod, and uniform lighting. However, the photographs served only as a control for the assessment of the scar region, so we could have used a different setup.\nFluorescence imaging",
    "NOTE: Depending on the excitation and emission wavelengths of the fluorescent microbeads, select the appropriate filter block and excitation lasers (e.g., the red microbeads used here have excitation and emission wavelengths of 580 nm and 605 nm, respectively; therefore, the selected excitation laser and bandpass filters were set to 532 nm, 580/30 nm and 610/30 nm, respectively).\n\t\nSelect fluorescence-mode imaging on the variable-mode scanner. Set the photomultiplier tube to 430 V or equivalent and the pixel size to 100 x 100 µm. Select an excitation laser (532 nm) closest to the excitation wavelength of the fluorescent microbeads.\nFor the first filter block, select a bandpass filter (580/30 nm) that overlaps with the emission wavelength of the injected fluorescence beads (channel 1). Select a bandpass filter for the second filter block (610/30) outside the emission wavelength (channel 2).\n\t\tNOTE: The second filter block serves as a negative control and to remove auto-fluorescence while keeping the injection sites intact.\nScan both sides of the agar slices in the fluorescence mode of the variable-mode laser scanner using the two channels. Make sure that each slice is completely scanned, including the reference holes.\n5. Post-processing\nNOTE: The first step in image post-processing is the manual segmentation of the myocardium using in-house developed scripts to trace the endo- and epicardial borders, as well as the injection sites. This is the same for both MRI and fluorescence scans.\nSegment the myocardium in the MRI scans.\n\t\nSegment the endocardial and epicardial LV borders on the FLAIR MRI sequence images.\nCopy the LV segmentation from step 5.1.1 to the LGE-MRI dataset and segment the scar on the LGE MRI sequence.\nCopy the myocardium segmentation from step 5.1.1 to the T2*-weighted dataset and segment the SPIO depositions in the LV myocardium.\nProcess the fluorescence images and perform segmentations.",
    "Load the files obtained from the variable-mode scanner and make a separate image of each cross-sectional heart slice.\nFlip the slices that were scanned in base to apex orientation and sort the fluorescence images into a stack for both channels that is oriented from apex to base.\nSegment the endocardial and epicardial LV borders on the fluorescence images.\nSegment the scar manually on the fluorescence images and use the LGE-MRI scan and the photographs to confirm scar morphology.\nSubtract the image stack of channel 2 from the image stack of channel 1 to exclude auto-fluorescence. Manually segment the fluorescent microbead depositions and use the T2* images for confirmation.\nTo create an anatomically-correct 3D geometry, perform a rigid registration of the slices in the image stack based on the reference structures (the holes created by the rigid tubes). Calculate and store the applied translation and rotation of each image.\nApply the stored transformations to the image stacks and the segmentations. Linearly interpolate the segmentations of both sides of the slices to reconstruct the original slice thickness and to create a 3D model of the data.\n6. Analysis\nPerform 2D and/or 3D measurements of the distance between the centers of the injection sites and the IBZ to assess the injection accuracy. Measure the distance along the endocardial border of the LV segmentation. In Figure 2C and 2F, an example of the 2D and 3D measurements is indicated by the red line.\nSubscription Required.
