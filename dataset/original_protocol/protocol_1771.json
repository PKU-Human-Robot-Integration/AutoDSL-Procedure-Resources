Prepare at least five independent replicates.\nRemove medium from cells and wash them once with phosphate salt buffered solution (PBS) (Life technologies, #14190-094).\nAdd 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (Life technologies, #25200-056) and incubate them at 37°C 5% CO2 until cells are detached.\nAdd 9 mL of pre-warmed cultivation medium and mix well.\nCount cells using a cell counter or Neubauer chamber (Merck, #BR717805-1EA):\nMix 10 μL of cell solution and 10 μL 0.4% (w/v) Trypan blue (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #15250-061) and inject into a Neubauer cell counting chamber or an equivalent slide used for a cell counter.\nSeed 2 × 106 A549 human lung epithelial cells (ATCC, #CCL-185) into a p100 dish (TPP, #93100) in 12 mL cell cultivation medium per dish.\nIncubate cells at 37°C 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nWash the cells with PBS and incubate them in 12 mL DMEM (Life technologies, #41966-029) without supplements 16 h prior to infection.\nCritical: This step helps to synchronize the cells and get rid of an important part of the serum albumin that is the main contaminant in the final samples (Nakhjavani et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nPrepare SDS lysis buffer freshly (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nCritical: Prepare SDS lysis buffer freshly for each replicate, always keep it on ice and use within 1 day.\nAdd 3 mL virus inoculum per plate (containing 25 PFU/cell) or up to 3 mL of allantoic liquid from mock-infected eggs as a control in a tube and pre-warm inoculum to 37°C.",
    "Critical: Always work in a biological safety cabinet when handling viruses. Do not add cold inoculum since this can trigger cellular stress pathways.\nSuck off serum-free medium from the cells and add the inoculum directly to the cells and leave them at 37°C for 10 min.\nNote: Infection time can be varied dependent on your experimental design.\nAfter the desired infection time, directly lyse the cells in 400 μL of SDS-lysis buffer per p100 dish (TPP, #93100) and use a cell scraper (TPP, #99003) to remove lysed cells from the plate. Transfer lysate in a fresh 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube (Eppendorf, #0030121023).\nPut Eppendorf-tubes on ice.\nIncubate samples at 95°C for 5 min while shaking at 300 rpm in the ThermoMixer (Eppendorf, #538400001) and directly put them on ice again.\nBriefly sonicate the lysates to reduce viscosity using a dry-sonicator (5 times 15 s pulse with 75% intensity) (Branson Ultrasonics Sonifier® SFX250, FisherScientific, #15569624) and put samples on ice again.Problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]\nCentrifuge at 14,000 × g and 4°C for 5 min to clarify the lysate and transfer lysates into a fresh 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nPause point: Store the cell extracts at −80°C until you finished all replicates.\nFilter aided sample preparation (FASP) and protein digestion\nTiming: 1.5 days\nCritical: Before you start, create a randomized list of your samples where each sample gets a number by chance and treat them randomized.\nQuantify protein concentration using Qubit Flex Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, #Q33327) according to manufacturer’s protocol: (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/Q33211#/Q33211[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/Q33211%23/Q33211]).\nAdd the Qubit buffer volume needed in an Eppendorf tube: 199 μL Qubit buffer per sample and 190 μL for each standard (3 in total).\nThen add the Qubit reagent 1:200 (v/v) to the buffer and vortex mixture.",
    "Aliquot 199 μL for samples and 190 μL for standards in Qubit tubes and add 1 μL sample or 10 μL of standard solutions to 500 μL thin-walled PCR tubes.\nVortex mixtures and incubate at 15°C–25°C for 15 min.\nMeasure according to Qubit instructions starting with the standard solution to calibrate the instrument.\nNote: Alternatively, the Invitrogen EZQ Protein Quantitation Kit (#R33200) or any other fluorescent dye based protein quantification method can be used. Biuret methods cannot be used because the lysis buffer contains DTT.\nUse 300 μg protein for each sample to start.\nPrepare all solutions needed:\nUA: 8 M urea in 100 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.2\nIAA solution: 100 μL 0.05 M iodoacetamide in 900 μL UA\n0.5 M NaCl in ddH2O\nTEAB: 0.05 M Triethylammoniumbicarbonat in ddH2O\nCritical: UA and IAA solutions must be freshly prepared and used within a day.\nLabel all tubes, lids and filters with the number from the randomized list of the corresponding sample.\nMix up to 50 μL of sample (containing 300 μg of protein) with 200 μL UA buffer and load onto the filter unit.\nCritical: Samples should be at 15°C–25°C before you start centrifuging.\nCentrifuge at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 15°C–25°C.\nDiscard flow-trough. Problems 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]\nRepeat step 20 until everything is loaded on the filter (in case several steps are needed to load the total amount of protein).\nDiscard flow-trough.\nAdd 200 μL of UA to the filter unit.\nCentrifuge at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 15°C–25°C.\nDiscard flow-trough.\nAdd 100 μL IAA solution (0.05 M) to the filter unit.\nMix at 600 rpm in the ThermoMixer for 1 min (lid open).\nCentrifuge at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 15°C–25°C.\nDiscard flow-trough.\nAdd 100 μL of UA to the filter unit.",
    "Centrifuge at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 15°C–25°C.\nDiscard flow-trough.\nRepeat step 25 twice.\nAdd 100 μL of 0.5 M NaCl to the filter unit.\nCentrifuge at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 15°C–25°C.\nDiscard flow-trough.\nRepeat step 27 once.\nAdd 100 μL of TEAB to the filter unit.\nCentrifuge at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 15°C–25°C.\nDiscard flow-trough.\nRepeat step 29 twice.\nTransfer the filter units to new collection tubes.\nReconstitute 20 μg lyophilized trypsin in 500 μL TEAB.\nCritical: Make sure that the trypsin is completely dissolved. After adding TEAB, pipette 10 times up and down and incubate the solution for 10 min at 15°C–25°C.\nAdd 120 μL of TEAB with 2% trypsin (5 μg trypsin per sample) to the filter unit.\nMix at 600 rpm in the thermo-mixer for 1 min.\nSeal all tube-lids with parafilm.\nIncubate the units for 16 h at 15°C–25°C in a wet-cell.\nElution and peptide drying\nTiming: 4 h\nCentrifuge the filter units at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 15°C–25°C.\nCritical: The flow-through of this step contains the digested proteins.\nRe-elute the column by adding 80 μL of TEAB.\nCentrifuge the filter units at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 15°C–25°C.\nTransfer 10 μL of each sample into a new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube for total extract samples and freeze them at -20°C.\nPause point: Samples can be stored at −20°C before drying.\nCompletely dry the rest of the digested peptides in a SpeedVac condensator at 35°C. This can take 2–3 h.",
    "Critical: Partial drying of peptides at this and later steps increases the yield of phosphorylated peptides. However, complete drying may be more reproducible with regard to quantitative analyses. Time for drying can vary between samples and is dependent on factors such as the amount and type of peptides present. Problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]\nEquilibration of MagReSyn® Ti-IMAC microspheres\nTiming: 30 min\nPrepare all solutions freshly before starting the enrichment:\n70% EtOH in ddH2O\nLoading buffer: 1M glycolic acid in 80% ACN, 5% TFA\nWash buffer 1: aqueous solution of 80% ACN and 1% TFA\nWash buffer 2: aqueous solution of 10% ACN and 0.2% TFA\nElution buffer: 1% NH4OH in ddH2O\nCritical: The equilibration of microspheres should be performed immediately before sample loading. Wait until the samples are completely dry before starting the equilibration procedure. Equilibration of the total amount of microspheres (20 μL/ sample) can be done in one tube, indicated amounts of buffers are for one sample.\nResolve MagReSyn® Ti-IMAC thoroughly by vortex mixing or inversion to ensure a homogenous suspension.\nTransfer 20 μL microspheres per sample to a 2 mL micro tube with a V bottom shape and screw cap.\nPlace the tube on a magnetic separator and allow microspheres to clear.\nRemove the shipping solution (around 50% of the volume) by aspiration with a pipette and discard.\nWash the microspheres in 200 μL of 70% EtOH with gentle agitation at 900 rpm in the ThermoMixer for 5 min.\nPlace the tube on the magnetic separator and allow the microspheres to clear.\nRemove the ethanol solution by aspiration with a pipette and discard.\nRepeat the washing step 43.\nWash the microspheres in 100 μL of ddH2O (Millipore) with gentle agitation at 900 rpm in the ThermoMixer for 10 min.",

    "Remove non-specifically bound peptides by adding the microspheres to 100 μL wash buffer 1 for 2 min with gentle agitation at 900 rpm in the ThermoMixer.\nPlace the tube on a magnetic separator and allow microspheres to clear.\nRemove the supernatant and discard.\nRepeat step 55 once.\nWash once with 100 μL wash buffer 2 for 2 min with gentle agitation at 900 rpm in the ThermoMixer.\nPlace the tube on a magnetic separator and allow microspheres to clear.\nRemove the supernatant and discard.\nNote: Washing with wash buffer 2 leads to better removal of hydrophilic peptides.\nElute the bound phosphopeptides from the microspheres by adding 80 μL elution buffer for 15 min at 900 rpm in the ThermoMixer.\nRepeat step 58 twice for a final elution volume of 240 μL.\nPlace the tube on the magnetic separator and allow the microspheres to clear.\nRemove the eluate containing the phosphopeptides and transfer to a new tube.\nAdd 60 μL of 10% FA to the 240 μL eluate to acidify the solution.\nCritical: Prepare formic acid solution freshly in a chemical safety hood before using it. Phopshopeptides are not stable under basic conditions. Therefore, the solutions should be acidified immediately after elution.\nDry peptides from phosphoenriched and total samples using SpeedVac condensator at 35°C (1–2 h).\nReconstitute enriched peptides in 150 μL 3% ACN; 0.1% TFA.\nSonicate peptides for 5 min in the water bath and shake them 5 min in the ThermoMixer at 1000 rpm.\nCentrifuge briefly at 140,000 × g.\nPause point: If you cannot directly continue with the desalting step, freeze samples at −20°C before drying or after reconstitution in 150 μL 3% ACN; 0.1% TFA.\nPhosphoenrichment using the KingFisher Flex system\nTiming: 1 h",
