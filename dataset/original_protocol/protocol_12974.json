    "1. Cell Line\nCulture 106 telomerase-immortalized human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) in a 6-well plate (density: 1039.9 cell/mm2) in a 37 °C incubator with a 5% CO2 atmosphere using bronchial epithelium growth medium (BEGM) until they reach 95% confluence.\n2.

    "Determine total protein concentrations of cell lysates using the Bradford protein assay.9\nLoad 30 µg total cell proteins into a 10% or 12% acrylamide gel for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and then electrophoretically transfer separated protein bands to nitrocellulose filters with a 200 mA current for 1 hr at 4 °C to use in western blot assays.\nBlock nitrocellulose filter membranes with 5% skimmed milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 hr, add primary rabbit polyclonal antibodies against non-phosphorylated HSP27 (1:1,000 dilution) or primary rabbit polyclonal antibody against phosphorylated HSP27 (1:1,000 dilution) in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and incubate the membranes overnight at 4 °C on a shaker.\nDetect immunoreactive bands using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (1:10,000 dilution) in 5% BSA after washing for 10 min 3 times with TBST.\nIncubate the membrane in the western blotting luminol reagents (6-7 ml per 10 cm × 5 cm membrane) for 1 min at room temperature.\nRemove the membrane from reagent solution, remove excess liquid with an absorbent towel, and place in a plastic sheet protector.\nWorking in a dark room with a safe light, place covered membrane in a film cassette with protein side facing up.\nPlace X-ray film on top of membrane and expose for 1 min.\n3. siRNA Transfection Assay10\nCulture HCECs at 5×105 cells/well in a 6-well plate in a 37 °C incubator with a 5% CO2 atmosphere using BEGM until they reach 95% confluence.\nDilute the transfection reagent (2.5 or 7.5 µl) with 100 µl reduced serum medium for transfection (the dilution factor was 41 or 14.3) and dissolve the HSP27-specific and scrambled control siRNA in 100 µl reduced serum medium to create 10 or 50 nM of HSP27-specific and scrambled control siRNA.",
    "Mix 100 µl siRNA solution with 100 µl diluted transfection reagent (1:1 ratio) and incubate the mixture for 15 min at room temperature.\nAdd the siRNA-lipid complexes to cells. Then after 4 hr change media to complete BEGM and incubate the cells for 2 days at 37 °C.\nAnalyze transfected cells by western blotting, as described from sections 4.1 to 4.7.\n4. Western Blot Assay for siRNA-transfected Cells11\nExtract HSP27-specific and scrambled control siRNA-transfected HCECs in a biological safety cabinet using 100 µl ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, 10 mM NaCl, 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 25 mM NaF, 2 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), protease inhibitors, and 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7).\nIncubate cells for 30 min on ice to induce cell lysis.\nPellet lysates at 10,000 x g for 15 min and then transfer supernatants to fresh 1.5 ml tubes (90 µl aliquots) and store them at -80 °C.\nDetermine protein concentrations of the cell lysates using the Bradford protein assay.9\nLoad samples with equal amounts of total cell proteins on a 10% or 12% acrylamide gel, subject the gel to SDS-PAGE, and electrophoretically transfer the separated protein bands to nitrocellulose filters with a 200 mA current for 1 hr at 4 °C to use in western blot assays.\nBlock nitrocellulose filter membranes with 5% skimmed milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 hr, add primary antibodies against phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated HSP27 (1:1,000 dilution), phosphorylated Akt (1:1,000 dilution), non-phosphorylated Akt (1:1,000 dilution, used as a cell survival marker), Bcl-2-associated X protein (1:1,000 dilution, used as a pro-apoptotic protein), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; 1:200 dilution, used as a loading control) in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and incubate the membranes overnight at 4 °C on a shaker.",
