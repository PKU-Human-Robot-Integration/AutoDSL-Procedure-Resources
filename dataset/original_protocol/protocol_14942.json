    "Ethics Statement: Male adult Sprague-Dawley rats (weighing 330-380 g) were used in this protocol. This protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the LSU Health Science Center-Shreveport and is in compliance with the 'Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals' (eighth edition, National Academy of Sciences, 2011).\n1. Preparation of Modified PE-50 Tube\nHold a 30 cm long PE-50 tube above a gas fire by hands, gradually soften the tube. Gently stretch the tube.\nSelect a point on the stretched tube using a digital caliper (Figure 1), mark it, and cut the modified PE-50 tube into a 25 cm long segment with a 1 cm long tip (outside diameter: 0.30-0.34 mm).\n2. Preparation of Homologous Blood Clots\nAnesthetize the rat with isoflurane (5% for induction, 2-3% for maintenance) in 70% N2O and 30% O2 by a face mask prior to blood collection. Confirm anesthesia by a toe pinch.\nPerform femoral arterial cannulation of a donor rat with published method4 and transfer femoral artery blood directly into a 20 cm long PE-50 tube. Place the tube for 2 hr at room temperature to clot blood, and then retain the tube for 22 hr at 4 °C.  Note: Cannulation is performed using aseptic technique as described in step 3.1. The donor rat is recovered for further sampling.\nCut the PE-50 tube into 50 mm segments and flush out the clot from the tube into a sterile Petri dish containing normal saline.\nTransfer the 50 mm long clot into a 60 mm long PE-10 tube and connect each end of the PE-10 tube to a 20 cm long PE-50 tube connected to 1 ml syringe containing normal saline with 23 G needle (Figure 2).",
    "Shift the clot by continuous alternating movement from one syringe to the other for 5 min, which can remove blood cells from the clot and minimize the fragile of extravascular coagulated clot, without disrupting the fibrin core.\nCut the clot into a 40 mm long segment and transfer the clot segment into a modified PE-50 catheter as described in step 1.2 under aseptic conditions. Note: All PE tubing is sterilized with ethylene oxide. \n3. Embolic Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (Figure 3A,B)\nSterilize all surgical tools by autoclaving (minimum 121 °C, 15 PSI, for 15 min). Sanitize the surgery table and associated surgical equipment using 70% ethanol.\nAnesthetize the rat with isoflurane as described in step 2.1. Test the depth of anesthesia by performing a toe pinch on both rear feet, and any observed movement (withdrawing the paw) indicates that the animal is not sufficiently anesthetized to do surgery. Apply a small amount of vet ointment on both eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia. Shave the fur on the ventral neck and head regions with electric clippers to expose the skin areas.\nPlace the rat in the supine position on a heating pad. Insert a rectal probe, control and maintain body temperature between 36.5-37.5 °C using a homeothermic blanket control unit.\nDisinfect the shaved skin and surrounding fur with 10% povidone-iodine followed by 70% ethanol.\nMake a 2-cm-long midline incision on the neck under a dissecting microscope. Use retractors to expose the surgical field and dissect the right common carotid artery (CCA), external carotid artery (ECA), internal carotid artery (ICA), and pterygopalatine artery (PPA) free from surrounding nerves and fascia (Figure 3A). Note: Before surgery, change sterile gloves if no assistant helps to prepare the animal.",
    "Dissect the CCA free from the surrounding nerves (without harming the vagal nerve) and place a sterile 5-0 silk suture under the artery. Tie a slip knot (#1) and grasp the suture using a small hemostat and pull taught toward the body.\nDissect the ECA and its two branches, the occipital artery (OA) and the superior thyroid artery (STA). Coagulate two branches using a veterinary electrosurgical unit. Place two pieces of sterile 6-0 silk sutures under the ECA.\nSeparate the two silks placed under the artery, one piece towards the head (distal end) and the other towards the body. Tie a tight ligature (#2) on the side closest to the head, grasp the silk with small hemostats and pull taught toward the head. Prepare a loose knot (#3) with the other silk to use later.\nDissect the ICA and PPA from the surrounding nerves (without harming the vagal nerve). Tie the PPA with a 6-0 suture (#4). Make a slip knot with 6-0 suture around the ICA (#5). Alternatively, clip the ICA using a microvascular clip.\nCut a small hole (1/2 thru) into the ECA between the tight (#2) and loose (#3) ligatures with a Vannas-style spring scissors. Insert the modified PE-50 tube containing blood clot into the incision and advance to the bifurcation of the CCA. Tighten the loose ligature (#3) around the lumen just enough to secure preserve mobility of the in-dwelling tube.",
    "Cut off the ECA at the site of small hole to free the stump and position the stump below the bifurcation of the ECA and ICA; this will allow the modified tube easily slide into the ICA. Open the ICA and gently advance the tube from the lumen of the ECA into the ICA until the tip of the catheter reaches the origin of the MCA (~17 mm from the bifurcation). Note: Before insert the tip of tube into the ECA, sterile the outer surface of tube with 70% ethanol, and then wash with sterile normal saline.\nInject the clot through the modified PE-50 catheter along with 10 μl of saline over 10 sec using a 100 μl Hamilton syringe (Figure 3B).\nWithdraw the catheter from the ECA 5 min later. Tie the ECA and reopen CCA. Suture the incision on the neck.\n4. Monitoring Regional Cerebral Blood Flow (rCBF)\nPrior to MCA occlusion, make a 1.2 cm long midline incision in the scalp to expose the skull bone. Remove the tissues on the skull bone with a dental scraper and sterile cotton swaps. Note: Before surgery, the exposed scalp area and surrounding fur are disinfected with 10% povidone-iodine followed by 70% ethanol.\nDrill a 1.5 mm diameter burr hole located at 2 mm posterior and 5 mm lateral to the bregma using a 0.7 mm spherical stainless steel burr (Figure 4).\n\tNOTE: Keep the dura intact.",
    "Place the probe 0.5 mm above the dura surface. Monitor the rCBF at 0 (baseline), 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after embolization and continue at 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min after intravenous administration of tPA.  After the last measurement of rCBF, the scalp incision is closed by suture. Note: Prior to neck incision we measure rCBF as baseline before MCA occlusion. Post MCA occlusion we measure rCBF after suture closure of neck incision. Thus, the neck incision is kept sterile. \n5. Post-operative Care\nInject 2.5 ml of saline solution subcutaneously to prevent dehydration and inject Buprenex (0.05 mg/kg, SC) immediately after the surgery and every 6-12 hr as needed for pain relief.\nStop isoflurane anesthesia. Place the rat in a 37 °C veterinary recovery chamber (keep animal warm) and keep observation. It generally takes 10 min for the rat to recover from anesthesia. Then, put the animal into a sterilized cage, place some wetted food in a Petri dish in the cage, and return the cage to animal sterilization room.\n24 hr after stroke, euthanize the rat with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg body weight, IP).\n6. Neurological Deficit Score\nPerform the Bederson score before and at 2 hr after embolization. Use a grading scale of 0-3 as previously described5: 0, raising the rat by tail, the animal extending both forelimbs to the floor and exhibiting no other deficits (normal movement); 1, raising the rat by tail, flex the contralateral forelimb; 2, decreased resistance to lateral push (and forelimb flexion) without circling; 3, the same behavior as grade 2 with circling.\n\tNOTE: Rats showing Bederson score = 0 (no deficit) at 2 hr after embolization are excluded from further study.\nSubscription Required.
