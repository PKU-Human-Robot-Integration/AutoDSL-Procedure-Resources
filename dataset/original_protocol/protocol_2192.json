    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAutoclave double-bagged packs of supplies\nTiming: 24 h\nRodent chow sterilized by irradiation can be sourced commercially but is costly and generally, irradiation is considered less effective than steam sterilization. Steam sterilization can be easily performed in-house where there is access to an autoclave, thus saving money and providing better oversight of the QC measures used for ensuring sterility. Having ready-made, pre-sterilized, sealed packs of diet/bedding/enrichment is convenient in a gnotobiotic facility for quick entry of supplies into an isolator. These sterile packs can be held in a storeroom and are immediately ready to be cold sterilized into an isolator or into a biosafety cabinet for topping up individual IsoCage type cages. Preparing these packs in bulk will save operational time overall.\nWeigh or scoop equal volumes of diet/bedding inside paper satchels. Seal with autoclave tape.\nOur facility packs 1–1.1 kg of diet, 450–500 g of bedding, a handful of crinkle nest and 12 × nestlet squares per pack.\nDiet and bedding are evenly spread to ensure each pack is no more than 5 cm in thickness when laid flat.\nThe supplies are first bagged in brown paper satchels and then the pack is sealed inside autoclave steam sterilization medical paper bags as pictured in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1800-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Order of packing sterile supplies into paper bags\n(A–C) Consumables (A) are packed firstly into brown paper bags (B) followed by white autoclave bags (C).\nPrepare Test packs for diet or bedding as described above under before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin], test pack[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3] section and shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1800-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Example of bedding Test pack\nSCBI buried inside as indicated by black arrow. Test packs should also be prepared for autoclave loads of diet.",
    "When loading packs into the autoclave, do not stack them directly on top of each other as this will hinder the penetration of steam. Arrange packs onto autoclave shelves in a single layer.\nAfter autoclaving, remove the SCBI from the Test pack and incubate as per manufacturer’s instruction. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nCritical: Keeping pack size/weight consistent for diet and bedding is critical to ensure steam can evenly penetrate through the dense particles for all packs in the load. It is less critical for crinkle nest and nestlets where pack sizes are less dense.\nPrepare biosafety cabinet\nTiming: 1 h\nSterilizing the workspace inside the biosafety cabinet is a very critical step and must be done with great thoroughness. Although there are a multitude of different ways to sterilize a biosafety cabinet, this protocol has been working well for our facility at preventing cross-contaminations between use.\nUV sterilize a clean biosafety cabinet for 30 min.\nWithout turning the biosafety cabinet on or opening the sash, fog the biosafety cabinet for 1–3 min(s) through the tygon with F10SC disinfectant.\nLeave for 10 min.\nKeep biosafety cabinet closed and off during this time.\nOnce fogging is complete, wipe down the bench surface of the biosafety cabinet with Clidox-S® soaked Chux® wipe (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table], Product code# 86768603) or similar low-lint fabric wipe, along with the guard/armrest area and the bottom of the glass sash.\nCold sterilize zip lock bags inside and out by completely submerging them (2–5 s) in a tub of Clidox-S® and place them inside the biosafety cabinet.\nFor each pack that has been autoclaved, two zip lock bags are required.",
    "The cabinet will become quite wet. A Chux® wipe and large plastic beaker is also cold sterilized and brought into the biosafety cabinet which can be used to mop up excess Clidox-S® regularly throughout the process.\nOnce the cabinet is filled with enough zip lock bags, leaving a small amount of room to work, wait at least 10 min (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1800-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Plastic zip lock bags, a beaker, and Chux® wipe, all cold sterilized in Clidox-S® and aseptically brought into a sterilized biosafety cabinet by gently tossing them in\nPause point: The cold sterilized zip lock bags can be left inside the biosafety cabinet for longer than 10 min.\nSeal the packs aseptically into zip lock bags\nTiming: 30 min or more\nThe timing of this step will depend on the number of parcels that require sealing. This step ideally requires two people but it is possible with one (troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]). Person one will maintain sterility and work within the biosafety cabinet. Person two will assist with handling non-sterile items and aseptically pass packages into the biosafety cabinet.\nPerson one dons a hair net, an autoclave sterilized, cuffed, long-sleeved, surgical gown (re-usable, cotton, washable and autoclavable laboratory gowns) and disposable, sterile, long-cuffed nitrile gloves (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table], SKU# MDS2295), in similar fashion to a surgeon gowning up for surgery.\nFor extra measure, wipe gloved hands in Clidox-S® prior to placing them into the biosafety cabinet.\nWipe all the way to the end of the cuff.\nWait for 10 min with sterilized, gloved hands inside the biosafety cabinet before starting the packing process.\nPerson two submerges an autoclaved pack (2–3 s) so that it is wet (not completely soaked through) into the tub of Clidox-S® and drain off excess sterilant.",
    "Person two tears the outer autoclave tape seal and aseptically unfolds the opening of the package just below the biosafety cabinet sash. The medical sterilization bags are thick enough to resist becoming immediately soggy but steps 12–13 must be done swiftly.\nPerson one aseptically reaches into the package and pulls the inner parcel into the cabinet. See Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1800-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Person one aseptically pulling sterile, inner parcel from Clidox-S® submerged outer package, into the biosafety cabinet\nPerson two discards the outer package.\nPerson one seals the inner parcel into two zip lock bags, pressing out as much air as possible.\nTo avoid parcels becoming soaked and contaminated with Clidox-S®, use the Chux® wipe to soak up excess Clidox-S® and wring into the beaker.\nKeeping the outer zip lock bags wet allows longer contact time with Clidox-S® and is therefore ideal.\nRepeat steps 12–16 for all autoclaved packages.\nPlace sealed supply packs in a storeroom.\nNote: Person one should regularly wipe hands and surfaces throughout the procedure with Clidox-S®-soaked Chux® wipe to maintain sterility.\nNote: The packs can be UV sterilized for extra measure, prior to entry into isolators.\nEnter supply packages into isolators\nTiming: 30 min\nWhether the isolator is semi-rigid or flexible film, they are typically designed with an entry/exit port where these sterile supply packs can be placed prior to transfer into the isolator. Our facility uses semi-rigid isolators with rectangular ports, the use of which is described below.\nPrior to opening an isolator, ensure the inner port door is properly closed.\nOpen the outer port door and wipe over the entire port surface with generous volumes of Clidox-S®.\nSubmerge and wipe over the sterile packs in Clidox-S®. Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nPlace the packs into the port.",
    "Fog the port with Clidox-S®. A respirator must be worn when doing this.\nIt is recommended to allow the supplies to sit for as long as possible in the port to provide ample Clidox-S® contact time, even overnight if practical. However, in our experience, a minimum of 10 min-contact time in the port was sufficient to avoid contamination.\nNote: In line with good gnotobiotic practice, isolators are opened as infrequently as possible to avoid contamination risk. When it is opened, it is ideal to ensure as much waste from the isolator is removed as possible, and as many supplies as allowable are entered in."
