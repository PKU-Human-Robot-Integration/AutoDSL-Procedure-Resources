    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institution Review Board (IRB) of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. This pertains to standard-of-care, surgically resected MPM tumors removed following informed consent.\n1. Preparation of tumor digestion media and other associated media\nTo prepare tumor digestion media, add 5 mL of 100% Pen/Strep (Penicillin/Streptomycin) to 500 mL of sterile Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium in a laminar flow hood.\n\t\nTransfer the medium to a 500 mL, 0.22 µm polyethersulfone (PES) sterile filter for vacuum filtration.\n\t\tNOTE: Filtration and aspiration steps should be performed with a standard vacuum pressure of 75-150 torr.\nLabel and date the tumor digestion medium and store it at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The medium can be stored for 1 month at 4 °C.\nTo prepare the tumor-digesting enzymatic cocktail, add 2.5 mL of 3% collagenase type 1, 1 mL of 1.5 mg/mL hyaluronidase, 20 µL of 250,000 units/mL DNAse 1 to 16.5 mL of digestion medium in a 50 mL conical tube in a laminar flow hood.\n\tNOTE: The total volume of the tumor-digesting enzymatic cocktail is 20 mL; however, only 10 mL is needed per tumor sample. As such, the remaining cocktail can be stored at -20 °C until needed. Do not refreeze aliquots.\nTo prepare complete tumor medium, add 5 mL of 100% Pen/Strep and 50 mL of fetal bovine serum (FBS) to 500 mL of sterile RPMI 1640 in a laminar flow hood.\n\t\nTransfer the medium to a 500 mL, 0.22 µm PES sterile filter for vacuum filtration.\nLabel and date the complete tumor medium and store it at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The medium can be stored for 1 month at 4 °C.",
    "To prepare reduced-serum medium for starvation, add 5 mL of 100% Pen/Strep and 5 mL of FBS to 500 mL of sterile RPMI 1640 in a laminar flow hood.\n\t\nTransfer the medium to a 500 mL, 0.22 µm PES sterile filter for vacuum filtration.\nLabel and date the reduced-serum medium and store it at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The medium can be stored for 1 month at 4 °C.\nTo prepare freeze medium, add 5 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to 45 mL of FBS in a laminar flow hood.\n\t\nTransfer the medium to a 50 mL, 0.22 µm PES sterile filter for vacuum filtration.\nLabel and date five 15 mL conical tubes.\nTransfer 10 mL of freeze medium to each tube and store the tubes at -20 °C.\nTo prepare antibiotic-free medium for mycoplasma testing, add 50 mL of FBS to 500 mL of sterile RPMI 1640 in a laminar flow hood.\n\t\nTransfer the medium to a 50 mL, 0.22 µm PES sterile filter for vacuum filtration.\nLabel and date the antibiotic-free medium and store it at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The medium can be stored for 1 month at 4 °C.\nTo prepare fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer for phenotypic analysis, add 16.6 mL of sterile bovine serum albumin to 500 mL of sterile 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in a laminar flow hood.\n\t\nLabel and date the FACS buffer and store it at 4 °C.\n\t\t​NOTE: FACS buffer does not require filter sterilization as long as both components are stored sterile. FACS buffer can be stored prior to opening for 6 months at 4 °C.\n2. Digestion of tumor tissue\nTransfer 10 mL of tumor-digesting enzymatic cocktail from step 1.2 to a dissociation tube.\nTransfer the piece of tumor tissue to a sterile 6-well plate lid using a sterile scalpel.",
    "NOTE: The amount of medium that is transferred with the tumor tissue is sufficient for processing.\n\t\nRemove all fatty tissue, necrotic tissue, and/or blood clots using a new sterile scalpel and forceps.\n\t\tNOTE: Fatty tissue is normally yellowish in appearance and semisolid. Necrotic tissue is darker than the surrounding tissue in appearance and very soft; both fatty and necrotic tissue will break apart easily. Bloody tissue appears bright red and may release blood into the medium when manipulated. Once removed, the resulting tumor tissue should hold shape and be pale or pink, depending on the tissue type.\nCut the entire tumor tissue into 1 mm3 small fragments. To ensure the tissue does not dry out, add 500 µL of sterile 1x Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) to the tumor tissue.\nTransfer tumor fragments into the dissociation tube containing 10 mL of tumor-digesting enzymatic cocktail (step 2.1). Close the tube tightly, place it cap-side down on the tissue dissociator, and add the heater apparatus by applying it like a sleeve over the dissociation tube and pressing to click it in place.\n\tNOTE: The maximum capacity for each tube is 4 g of tumor and 10 mL volume.\nSelect the preprogrammed setting on the dissociator 37C_h_TDK_1. Check the status after 10 min to ensure there is no clogging error as indicated by the flashing red light.\n\tNOTE: This program processes at 1,865 rpm for 1 h with temperature on at 37 °C.\n\t​NOTE: If clogging occurs, remove the dissociation tube and manually swirl it to dislodge any tissue caught in the lid; then replace the tube onto the dissociator and resume the program.",
    "Following the 1 h digestion, remove the dissociation tube and place it in a laminar flow hood. Filter the digested tumor by placing a 70 µm cell strainer on top of a 50 mL conical tube and pipetting the digested tumor using a 10 mL pipette onto the filter. If the filter clogs, switch to a new filter.\n\t\nRinse the dissociation tube with 10 mL of fresh tumor digestion media and pass the wash through the filter.\nRemove the 70 µm filter and discard it.\nBring the total volume to 40 mL with tumor digestion medium.\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at room temperature.\nUsing a 2 mL aspirating pipette attached to a vacuum source, aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the pellet, and resuspend the cells using 10 mL of sterile complete tumor medium.\nRepeat step 2.6.\nAspirate the supernatant as described in step 2.7. Resuspend the cells in 3 mL of sterile complete tumor medium and transfer the cell suspension to one well of a sterile 6-well plate.\nKeep the plate in an incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\nAfter 24 h, transfer the used medium from the digested tumor in well 1 to a new well (well 2) in the same 6-well plate. Add 3 mL of sterile complete tumor medium to well 1.\nTransfer the used medium from wells 1 and 2 and combine into well 3 in the same 6-well plate 24 h after step 2.11. Add 3 mL of sterile complete tumor medium into wells 1 and 2.\nAspirate the medium from all 3 wells and pipette 3 mL of complete tumor medium into each well 48 h after step 2.12.\n3. Generation of primary tumor cell line",
    "Using an inverted phase microscope, determine the percentage of fibroblast contamination in the early passage culture.\n\tNOTE: Fibroblasts are generally long and irregular and have an ill-defined cellular membrane. They appear thin or flat on a Z scale.\n\t\nIf fibroblast contamination is greater than 20% of the cells in the early passage culture, continue culturing after replacing the complete medium with reduced-serum medium.\nRepeat the replacement with reduced-serum medium in step 3.1.1 twice per week for 3-4 weeks.\nWhen the culture reaches 80% confluency, passage the cells by splitting 50:50 into 2 new wells of a 6-well plate. Continue passaging 50:50 in reduced-serum media once the cells reach 80% confluency.\nRepeat step 3.1.3 for up to 4 weeks, passaging in larger culture flasks as needed by splitting 50:50 once the culture reaches 80% confluency. If the fibroblast population is not reduced to 10% or less, continue to step 3.2 to attempt the differential trypsinization method to remove fibroblast contamination. Otherwise, proceed to step 3.3.\nTo enrich for tumor cells, gently rinse the well with 1x PBS to remove the medium containing serum.\n\t\nAdd trypsin as follows: 1 mL per well if in a 6-well plate, 2 mL for a T25 flask, 3 mL for a T75 flask.\nPlace the 6-well plate or flask in an incubator at 37 °C for 1 min. Remove the plate or flask from the incubator and check the adhesion of the cells using an inverted microscope. If the cells are partially lifting or floating, gently remove the suspended cells and trypsin only. Place the cells in a 15 mL conical tube containing an equal or greater volume of complete tumor medium.\n\t\tNOTE: This partial collection of cells based on adhesion properties is the first of multiple fractions.",
    "Repeat steps 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 until all the cells are lifted, or there are 4 fractions removed.\nCentrifuge all independent fractions at 500 × g for 5 min at room temperature.\nAspirate the supernatant as described in step 2.7, and resuspend the cells using 5 mL of sterile, reduced-serum medium.\nPlate the cells in a T25 flask for each fraction and place the flasks in an incubator at 37 °C.\nAssess the culture after 48 h to determine which fraction is enriched for tumor cells versus fibroblasts. Discard fibroblast-rich flasks. If fibroblast contamination is <10%, continue expansion in complete tumor medium and proceed to step 4. If fibroblast contamination is 10-30%, repeat steps 3.1.2-3.1.4. If fibroblast contamination is greater than 30%, repeat steps 3.2-3.2.7.\nIf few or no fibroblasts are detected within the early passage culture, continue passaging the cells in complete tumor medium by splitting 50:50 once the cells are 80% confluent in their 6-well plate or flask.\n4. Expansion of early passage primary tumor cell line\nOnce the primary tumor culture contains 10% or less of fibroblast contamination, aspirate the medium and replace it with sterile complete tumor medium twice per week.\n\tNOTE: The optimal medium volume for a T25 is 5 mL; T75 is 12 mL; T150 is 25 mL.\n\t\nPassage the culture 50:50 into larger flasks as needed once it reaches 80% confluency in the plate or flask.\n\t\tNOTE: The culture may need to be passaged at a higher ratio depending on its growth. Adjust so the culture reaches 80% confluency every 3-5 days.\nPassage until the culture is at passage 4 or above. Once the culture is 80% confluent in a minimum of two T75 flasks, continue to step 5.\n5. Characterization and banking of established primary tumor cell line",
    "Cryopreserve one T75 flask as an early-passage freeze. For mycoplasma testing of the remaining T75 flasks, continue to step 5.2.\n\t\nFor cryopreservation of early-passage cells, thaw 1 tube of aliquoted freeze medium prepared in step 1.5.\nCollect the cells by trypsinization by first washing the plate with 1x PBS as described in step 3.2 and adding trypsin as described in step 3.2.1.\nPlace the flask in an incubator at 37 °C for 3 min. Remove the flask from the incubator and check the adhesion of the cells using an inverted microscope. If the cells are lifting or floating, gently remove the suspended cells and trypsin. Place the cells in a 15 mL conical tube containing an equal or greater volume of complete tumor medium.\n\t\tNOTE: If the cells remain adherent after 3 min, place the flask back in the incubator for an additional 2 min.\nMix the tube well by pipetting gently and remove 20 µL for counting.\nCentrifuge the tube at 500 × g for 5 min at room temperature.\nWhile the cells are spinning, count using a lab-specific counting protocol such as trypan blue or acridine orange/propidium iodide (AO/PI).\nResuspend the cells following centrifugation in freeze medium with a minimum of 2 × 106 cells/1 mL freeze medium.\nTransfer 1 mL of the cell suspension from step 5.1.7 to prelabeled 1.5 mL cryovials.\nPlace the cryovials in a controlled-rate freeze chamber and transfer them immediately to -80 °C.\nStore the cells at -80 °C for up to 1 week before transferring them to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.\nSplit a T75 flask 50:50 for mycoplasma testing. Change the medium to antibiotic-free medium prepared in step 1.6.\n\t\nAfter 72 h, thaw the mycoplasma detection reagent, substrate, and controls at room temperature for 15 min before testing.",
    "Collect 1 mL of the supernatant from each culture to be tested and place it in a 15 mL conical tube.\nPellet any suspended cells by centrifuging the supernatant at 500 × g for 5 min at room temperature.\nLoad 100 µL of sample supernatants and controls into a white 96-well plate. Add 100 µL of mycoplasma detection reagent to each sample and control.\nIncubate for 5 min at room temperature.\nPlace the plate in a plate reader and read the luminescence (Reading A, i.e., first Reading).\n\t\tNOTE: The mycoplasma kit manufacturer's protocol indicates keeping the default settings on multifunctional plate readers. The read is set at Luminescence endpoint with an integration time of 1 s and gain of 135. The plate reader uses an Auto-scale routine to optimize the gain signal for each experiment. The 1 s integration time is standard default. Both settings are used to adjust the intensity of the luminescent signal interpreted by the plate reader and may need to be adjusted depending on the individual plate reader.\nRemove the plate from the plate reader and add 100 µL of the mycoplasma detection substrate to each sample and the controls.\nIncubate for 10 min at room temperature.\nPlace the plate in the plate reader and read the luminescence (Reading B, i.e., second Reading).\nTo determine mycoplasma positivity, determine the ratio of Reading B to Reading A.\n\t\tNOTE: Mycoplasma positivity ratios are described in the mycoplasma kit manufacturer's protocol. Readings A and B are acquired with the same settings and simply reflect the reading order.\n\t\t\nConsider a ratio < 1 to be mycoplasma-negative.\nConsider a ratio of 1-1.2 to be inconclusive and repeat step 5.2.\nConsider a ratio > 1.2 to be mycoplasma-positive and monitor this culture; terminate the culture if necessary.",
    "Flow cytometry characterization of mycoplasma-negative tumor cells\n\t\nDislodge the tumor cells using cell-dissociation buffer.\nCount the cells and resuspend the cells at 1 × 106/mL in FACS buffer from step 1.7.\nRemove 100 µL of cell suspension into individual tubes for surface staining.\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at room temperature.\nAspirate the supernatant and block Fc receptors by incubating the cells in 500 µL of 5% goat serum in FACS buffer at room temperature for 10 min.\nAdd 2 mL of FACS buffer and centrifuge the suspension at 500 × g for 5 min at room temperature.\nAspirate the supernatant and add the surface stain mix of antibodies (Table 1) and FACS buffer so that the final volume is 100 µL. Cover the samples and stain them on ice for 30 min.\nRepeat step 5.3.6.\nAspirate the supernatant and fix the cells by resuspending in 200 µL of 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) plus 0.25% EtOH. Incubate at room temperature for 20 min with the samples protected from light.\nRepeat step 5.3.6. Resuspend the cells in 200 µL of FACS buffer for acquisition using an appropriate flow cytometer.\n\t\tNOTE: Mesothelioma tumor cells are expected to be positive for mesothelin and N-cadherin. Some may also express CD90.\nExpand in complete tumor medium and bank as described in steps 4.1 and 5.1, respectively.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
