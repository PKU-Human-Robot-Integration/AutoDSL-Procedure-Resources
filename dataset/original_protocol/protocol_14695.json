  "procedures": [
    "Ethics Statement: Stony Brook University Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved this protocol on February 10, 2015.\n1. Recruitment of Participants for Remotely-Supervised tDCS\nProvide recruited study participants with information on the device and the ten day study protocol.\n2. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria\nHealth\n\t\nEnsure that a clinician has provided medical clearance for all enrolled participants at the baseline visit.\ntDCS tolerability and laptop aptitude\n\t\nEnsure that participants are familiar with the basic functioning of a laptop computer and how to connect the computer to Wi-Fi internet. For both the use of the laptop, and the setup of the tDCS device, ensure that participants (or a proxy), have the dexterity to complete the procedures.\nBeyond setup, at baseline visits, give participants a 1 min trial dose of 1.5 mA of tDCS to determine tolerability. If participants cannot tolerate this session, a lower dose of 1.0 mA can be applied. If neither is tolerated, exclude the participant.\nEnvironmental\n\t\nConfirm that participants have access to a distraction-free, well lit, clean environment with a safe area to store the device and device kit.\nCompliance\n\t\nIf a participant does not adhere to the scheduled video conference session in a timely fashion, exclude that participant.\nStop Criteria\n\t\nAt each participant interaction, review a series of predetermined \"stop criteria\" to ensure that participants tolerate the session, adhere to the study schedule, and safely operate the device without adverse effects. Should any of these be met, exclude the participant from the study (Figure 1).\n3. Materials\nNote: As recommended in the published guidelines for remotely-supervised use16, precise electrode preparation and placement must mirror the clinic protocol with respect to dose control and ongoing monitoring.\nDevice Kit",
    "Prepare the same materials for every remote tDCS participant. This includes a study provided laptop computer with secure video conferencing software, the device, and a device kit.\nDesign the device kit for ease of use and organize it by day (Figure 2).\nPrepare the kit with twenty wrapped sponge pockets of size 5x5cm with a perforation at the top (two per day required for a 10-day study) , twenty syringes pre-filled with 6 mL of saline solution for each sponge pocket, a wash bottle filled with extra saline, spare batteries for the device, and a handheld mirror for headset application.\nIn addition, require that study users have a portable home phone or mobile phone at their workspace for each session.\nDevice\n\t\nChoose a tDCS device that only releases a session through a one-time use unlock code. Ensure that the study device has functionality whereby participants can only administer a session after being provided the code by the study technician. In addition, ensure that in the selection of a study device, contact quality is continually monitored to ensure safe and proper use.\nVideo Monitoring\n\t\nChoose a secure video conferencing software to allow for remote supervision of the proper setup of the device, optimal contact quality, and that the intended user is applying the session.\nUse the video conferencing software as another method of training. Instruct users how to turn the device on, read their contact quality, troubleshoot poor contact quality, enter a one-time use unlock code, and safely remove the device after shutdown.\nHeadgear",
    "Design the headgear for simple and robust electrode positioning. Use a single-position headgear to eliminate room for user error, and to help conserve the placement of the montage. Configure a cap-like design, with clearly labeled sponge markers to enhance the reliability of placement in the single-position headgear with the anodal electrode placed on the left side.\n4. Training\nNote: Complete the majority of participant training during the first baseline session of the remote study. Roughly 1-2 hr of the baseline visit should be spent on training. Allow participants to view an instructional tDCS video as their first instruction.\nInstructional video\n\t\nSet up the instructional video to play for the participant following the baseline visit. During the viewing, allow the participant to have access to the device and device kit and to follow along at each step.\nPrepare the video to first introduce the participant to the materials and then transition into a step-by-step guide that mimics the flow of an actual study session.\nPresent the setup of the tDCS headset slowly and clearly (and make it available for replay), should the user need clarification. Also provide a participant view so that the study participant can gain a sense of what device screens to expect and how the device display will appear when providing certain readings.\nVideo sections\n\tNote: Remote technicians will not provide unlock codes for devices unless appropriate contact quality is achieved.\n\t\nDesign the instructional video to detail the means of troubleshooting poor contact quality, including applying pressure and moistening the sponge pockets. Ensure that the video also provides information on the safe usage of study materials, as well as the protocol to follow in order to end a session.",
    "Instruct participants on procedures to terminate a session and require participants to maintain phone access throughout the duration of the session, ensuring that a level of in-clinic safety is maintained in the case of emergency,\nFollowing the video, allow the participant to attempt their own set up with the aid of a study technician.\nInstruction manual\n\t\nPrepare a transcript of the information presented in the video, as well as photographs and diagrams of the materials, device screenshots, and laptop information, in the form of a manual.\nIn-person training\n\t\nMonitor the participant as they begin the set-up.\nCoach the participant through each step (moisten sponge pockets, insert electrode into the sponge, fasten sponges on to the headset, place headset on head, center the headset, confirm with study technician, and turn device on).\nClarify the procedure or equipment where necessary.\nTroubleshooting for participants that experience setup difficulty\n\t\nIf participants struggle with the set-up, repeat the demonstration of the method.\nIf participants are unable to complete the set up after repeated attempts, terminate the session. This is defined as a study \"stop\" criteria.\n5. Participant Preparation for Study Session\nInstruct participants to set up their study laptop, mobile phone, device kit, device and headset in a clean, well lit area. Inform participants to pull hair back and minimize distractions.\nAllow participants to refer to the instructional video or manual for a step by step guide of the protocol.\nFirst initiate web conference with the study participant before beginning setup so that there is ongoing monitoring for compliance16.\n6. Device Setup during Study Session\nAfter the video conference is initiated, instruct the participant to begin set up.",
    "Open the sponge pockets and moisten using the 6 mL syringes (one syringe per sponge pocket). About 3 mL can be used to moisten each side of the sponge pocket.\nApply carbon-rubber electrodes to carry current from the tDCS stimulator. Encase the electrodes in sponge pockets. Insert each carbon rubber electrode into the sponge pocket fully. Note: Since direct skin contact with rubber electrodes is painful, electrodes are encased in sponge pockets.\nEnsure the red cable is connected to red receiver plug labeled 'anode' on the device. Ensure the black cable is connected to black receiver plug labeled 'cathode' on the device. These cables are never removed from the device.\nConnect the sponge pockets and electrodes to the headset using the common bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPC), with the anodal electrode (one connected to the red wire) placed on the left side. Note: Label the headset with red and black to ensure proper electrode placement.\nFasten the headset using buttons on the sponge pockets that fit into grooves on the headset. The smooth side of the sponge pocket always faces in toward the forehead.\n\tNote: This offers ease of reliable electrode placement and wide therapeutic applications.\nAfter the sponge pockets are fastened, position the headset on the head. Tuck the back strap beneath the groove in the back of the head and align the center button with the nasion. This can be confirmed using the handheld mirror supplied in the device kit and by the study technician through video conferencing software.\nAt this point, instruct the participant to read aloud the contact quality on the device display. Note: A moderate or optimal reading is required for session code administration.",
    "If contact quality needs to be improved, instruct participants to follow pre-set troubleshooting procedures. First, recommend applying pressure to the sponge pockets. If this does not prove successful, give participants the option to apply a small amount of saline solution to the sponge pockets using the wash bottle (paper towels are provided for any spillage).\nOnce proper contact quality is achieved, administer a one-time use unlock code for the sessions. Note: These codes are pre-programmed by study staff for the set amount of time and amplitude.\n7. Session completion\nNote: After the participant enters the unlock code, the screen of the device will show a timer that counts down the minutes until the end of the session. The device will also indicate the contact quality of the electrodes throughout the session. When 1 min remains on the timer, a countdown in seconds will occur.\nIf contact quality falls below \"moderate\" provide instructions on how to improve it using the troubleshooting steps in 6.9.\nRemind the participant to not to remove the headset until the seconds have fully counted down to zero and the device shuts off (confirmed with a beeping noise).\nInstruct the participant to remove the headset when the device beeps.\nDirect the participant to remove sponge pockets from the device and discard them. Syringes are one time use as well and should also be discarded.\nEnsure that the participant stores the device and headset in the kit.\nRemind the participant to safely store the laptop, device, and all materials for the next session.\n8. End of Study Analyses",
    "Assess each study participant using a participant tracker. This serves as a method of recording study compliance, adverse events, and session completion. At the end of study, review each participant's data to determine study success. For the purpose of this protocol, study success will be defined by 80% of participants having completed 80% of study sessions24.\nValidate session success through records of daily session attendance, review of daily pain scales and before and after stimulation questionnaires for adverse events Please see Supplemental Code Files for sample questionnaire.\n\tNote: Validation that the 20 min of stimulation were fully delivered can be reviewed at study end. The study technician can access the device for completion codes as confirmation."
