    "Prior to initiation, obtain appropriate tissue specimens according to Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocols. All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Genentech, Inc.\n1. Tissue and slide preparation\nSelect FFPE or fresh frozen tissue blocks and utilize the corresponding processing method below.\nCut tissue block sections onto positively charged glass slides at the desired thickness. Serially section the FFPE tissue in ribbons with the first reference section cut at a thickness appropriate for H&E staining (i.e., 4 µm) followed by 1-4 sections at a thickness ranging from 4-20 µm based on the need and tissue availability. Collect the tissue sections onto positively charged glass microscope slides.\n\tNOTE: Fresh frozen reference tissue sections should be stained immediately with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) using routine protocols for frozen sections and the unstained frozen sections held at -20 °C until they are needed for harvest.\nAllow all the FFPE sections to dry at room temperature overnight.\nBake the FFPE reference slides at 60 °C for 30 min and then stain with H&E using routine protocols.\nScan the H&E stained slides on a whole slide imager at 20x magnification or greater.\nAnnotate the scanned slide images for tumor regions of interest using a vendor provided viewing platform or open-source viewer. Export these annotations as either a low-magnification screenshot or save them as a metadata file containing X-Y pixel coordinates corresponding to polygon vertices.\n\tNOTE: The former is less technically challenging to work with, but the latter offers advantages in process automation.\nCreate digital masks of the annotated regions of interest in line with the approach used and export the manual annotations.",
    "​NOTE: If a screenshot/image of the annotations is used, simple image processing software can be used to select a region and to fill in the entire selection. Using X-Y coordinates for each ROI requires the use of a programming language to read both the image data and polygon coordinates to create a low-mag image with filled in regions of interest. The user should work with the automated dissection instrument vendor to establish a process based on their individual software availability and needs. If scanning, digital slide annotation and/or digital mask creation is unavailable, careful on-slide annotation using a marker can be performed and used in place of a digital mask as a reference image. Pseudocode for digital mask creation has been provided in Supplementary File 1.\n2. Automated tissue dissection\nPlace the unstained sample tissue slides onto the stage in the first through fourth slide positions when using digital slide reference. When using on-slide annotation rather than a digital option, place the unstained sample tissue slides onto the stage in the second through fourth slide positions with a reference slide in the first position.\nCreate a milling job using the automated tissue dissection software: Job Selection > Create New Job > Case ID > Name the milling job; go to Thickness > Section Thickness using the up or down arrow tab; then go to Tissue Preparation > Paraffinized or Deparaffinized, Reference Image > From File > Import Image > File to import from the dropdown as the digital reference, if applicable. Select From Stage for on stage slide reference. When fields are complete, scan the stage by selecting the Scan Stage button in the bottom-right corner to capture each sample tissue slide in the first through fourth position.\nSelect the tissue area for image capture.",
    "If using an on-stage reference, drag the box from one corner to the opposite to create a rectangular area over tissue. Select the circular bubble under the rectangular area to capture the stage reference image. If using a digital reference image, overlay the image on the rectangular area selected. Resize and align the digital reference grossly in course zoom to best match the size and position over the sample tissue.\nCopy this rectangle field onto remaining sample tissue slides in the second through fourth slide positions by selecting the copy option in the upper-right corner of the reference image. Align and resize grossly as necessary.\n\t\tNOTE: When using an on-slide reference image rather than a digital mask, select which slide on the stage should be used as the reference.\nAlign the reference and sample slides\n\t\nWhen the reference image is grossly aligned on tissue sample slides in all slide positions, select the Scan Stage button in the lower-right corner of the screen to move into the fine adjustment step. Select the first stage position and Transform tool icon (the third icon down in the right-hand toolbar) to make fine alignment and zoom adjustments of the reference to best match the sample slide overlay. Use the Reference to Sample sliding bar at the bottom of the screen toggling between reference image and sample image along with the Zoom In and Zoom Out feature to adjust and achieve alignment of each slide position. Replicate this process in the second through fourth sample slide positions.\nSelect the milling area of region of interest",
    "Once optimal sample overlay of each of the four slide positions is achieved, draw milling path designations using the Color Picker tool icon (the tenth icon down in the right-hand toolbar) on the colored portion of masked reference image. Select the Extend to Similar box if multiple slides or areas are annotated for dissection and then select the Get Annotation(s) button in lower right to draw milling paths onto sample slides. \nSelect the milling path in the first slide position.\n\t\tNOTE: When the milling path is selected in the first slide position, it will be copied onto the remaining slide positions and milling tip usage will be calculated. The milling tip usage in the upper-left corner is calculated based on the area covered and the tip size selected. If more than four tips are calculated, a larger tip size can be selected to capture the annotated ROI. Tip size can be selected or changed on the left side of the screen under the Milling Tip arrow and tip usage will be recalculated.\nWhen the milling path is calculated, collect the annotated ROI with four or less milling tips. Select the Setup Stage button in the lower right of the screen to prompt loading of milling tips from placed collection tubes in their proper designation on stage.\nFill the reservoir with 3.0 mL of the dissection buffer most appropriate for the tissue type (FFPE or fresh frozen) and downstream nucleic acid extraction kit needs and select the Dissect button in the lower-right corner of the screen. Use molecular grade mineral oil or an appropriate buffer from commercially available nucleic acid extraction kits.",
    "NOTE: Automated dissection of slides and selected regions of interest then begins and samples are collected by the instrument. The unit head will pick up milling tips from the back of the stage and fill with dissection fluid from the reservoir. Tips then spin along the milling path aspirating sample tissue from slides until complete or full. The collected sample with dissection fluid is then dispensed into collection tubes located at the back of the stage.\nWhen automated dissection is complete, remove the collection tubes and the dissected sample slides from the stage and place them in a tube rack and slide rack, respectively.\n\tNOTE: Fresh frozen harvests should be taken directly into nucleic acid extraction as per the manufacturer's instructions and post-dissection fresh frozen sections should be H&E stained immediately using routine protocols for frozen sections.\nBake the post dissected tissue slides at 60 °C for 30 min and then stain with H&E using routine protocols.\nScan the post dissected H&E stained slides on a whole slide imager at 20x magnification and/or archive for a reference of what tissue was not collected and remains on the slide.\n\t​NOTE: See step 1.5 above for alternative scanning options.\n3. Nucleic acid extraction\nPool and pellet the tissue. Perform the nucleic acid extraction using a commercially available kit and following the manufacturer's instructions.\nSubscription Required.
