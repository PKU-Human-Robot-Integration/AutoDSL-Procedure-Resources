    "All animal procedures must be approved by the local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). The animal protocol for the following procedure was approved by the University of Colorado Denver IACUC.\n1. Obtain Rats\nNOTE: Unless genetically modified animals are desired, 6-week-old, skeletally immature Sprague-Dawley rats are needed at the time of surgery. Other strains could potentially be used; however, the majority of published studies have been performed on Sprague-Dawley rats.\n2. Preparation of Surgical Supplies\nAutoclave surgical supply packs that include one each of the following: #3 scalpel handle, needle holder, Adson forceps, and iris scissors.\nAutoclave the keyless drill chucks. Drill chucks may be bead sterilized between animal surgeries when operating on multiple animals.\n\tNOTE: Local IACUC rules pertaining to the use of sterile surgical tools on multiple animals must be adhered to. For example, the University of Colorado Denver IACUC allows for one surgical tool set to be used on up to 5 animals before their discontinuation. Furthermore, surgical tools must be heat sterilized using a bead sterilizer between animals. Additional sterile surgical packs must be used for any additional animals.\nAutoclave 5-cm Steinmann pins, one for each animal.\n\tNOTE: To reduce the risk of infection, the Steinmann pins must not be used for multiple animals.\nAutoclave 1.8-mm dental burs, one for each animal.\n\tNOTE: To reduce the risk of infection, the dental burs must not be used for multiple animals.\nAutoclave a wound clip applicator, if applicable. Alternatively, buried sutures may be used to close the cutaneous layer. See step 7.3.\nIf possible, sterilize a rotary drill using irradiation or gas sterilization.",
    "Collect the following additional supplies: electric shaver, sterile 3-0 polyglycolic acid sutures, sterile gauze, povidone-iodine, sterile saline, sterile 10-mL syringes, sterile 23-gauge needles, isopropyl alcohol swabs, isoflurane, calipers, post-surgical analgesics (e.g., NSAIDs and buprenorphine), sterile surgical drapes, sterile surgical gloves, sterile #15 scalpel blades, sterile wound clips, anesthesia machine, bead sterilizer, warming pad, and absorbent underpads.\n3. Anesthesia and Preparation of Animals\nAnesthetize the animal by introducing it to a 1- to 2-L induction chamber receiving 1 L/min oxygen flow with 5% isoflurane from a vaporizing system with a passive scavenging system.\n\tNOTE: Exposure to 5% isoflurane should anesthetize 6-week-old rats within 5 min.\nMove the animal to the surgical site and maintain the animal under anesthesia with 2 - 3% isoflurane using a nose cone for the remainder of the procedure. Place the animal supine on a warming pad and an absorbent underpad.\n\tNOTE: The animal does not need to be fixed to the surgical table. Holding the leg as specified in the steps below is a sufficient method of stabilization.\n\tNOTE: All subsequent procedures are to be done with the animal under anesthesia. 2 - 3% isoflurane should be sufficient to maintain anesthesia in rats at this age. This can be confirmed by testing the bipedal withdrawal reflex.\nAdminister intraoperative analgesics in accordance with institutionally approved policies (e.g. buprenorphine at 0.05 mg/kg and carprofen at 5 mg/kg). \n4. Preparation of the Tibia for Surgery\nShave the entire hind leg(s) from the medial malleolus to the pelvis with an electric shaver.\nMeasure and record the tibial length from the anterior tibial plateau to the inferior side of the medial malleolus using calipers. Alternatively, measure the whole tibial length using X-ray or microCT11,12,14. Optionally, measure growth plate dimensions prior to surgery using X-ray or microCT.",
    "Clean the surgical site by wiping the entire leg(s), abdomen, and genitalia with alcohol swabs and then with povidone-iodine-soaked gauze.\n\tNOTE: To minimize the risk of infection, all subsequent procedures, until the animal is removed from anesthesia (step 7.4), must be done under sterile conditions. All of the surgical materials must be accessed using sterile technique. The use of a surgical assistant is highly recommended to maintain sterility throughout the surgery.\nWearing sterile surgical gloves, place a fenestrated sterile surgical drape over the animal, leaving the leg(s) exposed through the central fenestration.\n5. Surgical Procedure to Access the Growth Plate\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55571/55571fig1.jpg\nFigure 1:Overview of the Surgical Procedure.\nA) Location of several anatomical markers used to create a successful growth plate injury. The knee capsule is immediately posterior to the kneecap (white), separating the tibia from the femur. The tibial growth plate (dark red) can be seen inferior to the kneecap and circumventing the tibia. The proximal growth plate is a mostly flat plane, except for the anterior quarter that forms a diagonal plane. The intersection of these two planes forms the growth plate angle, which is used for appropriate drill angulation. The semitendinosus insertion is where the quadriceps muscle inserts in the posterior tibia. B) Incision through the anterior-medial aspect of the tibial soft tissues to access the cortical bone. C) Location of the cortical window using alignment with the distal semitendinosus insertion as a reference point. D) Evaluating the depth of the injury by aligning the bevel on the dental bur with the cortical window.\nMake a ~1-cm incision through the skin along the medial-anterior aspect of the proximal tibia using a #3 scalpel handle and a #15 blade, starting at the distal end of the medial femoral condyle (Figure 1A).",
    "Pull the skin tight against the underlying bone and hold the leg firmly while making the incision.\n\t\tNOTE: This will keep the skin incision at the desired location and will aid in the creation of a clean incision. Do not press too firmly with the scalpel to avoid puncturing the knee capsule, which would result in profuse bleeding and will make the remaining steps difficult.\nMake note of important anatomical markers, including: 1) the growth plate, 2) the growth plate angle, 3) the knee capsule, and 4) the semitendinosus insertion (Figure 1A).\nUsing the scalpel, make a ~ 0.5-cm incision through the fascia and soft tissues on the medial-anterior aspect of the proximal tibia, from the growth plate to the bottom of the skin incision (Figure 1B).\nGently dissect or scrape away the fascia and soft tissues from the tibia using the scalpel (Figure 1B).\n\tNOTE: It is important to remove or scrape as much soft tissue from the tibia as possible so as not to interfere with the drilling steps.\nDrill a cortical window through the tibial cortical bone at the diaphysis with a Steinmann pin attached to a rotary tool at 10,000 RPM (low speed of the rotary tool specified in the materials section). Create the cortical window such that it aligns with the distal semitendinosus insertion (Figure 1C).\n\t\nHold the drill perpendicular to the tibial diaphysis and drill slowly, being careful not to drill through the other side of the diaphysis; the cortical window needs to be only ~ 2 mm in depth and will be made when no resistance is felt.\nAs above, hold the leg firmly with the other hand.",
    "NOTE: A dental bur may be used for this step. However, if a dental bur is used, the leg must be held very firmly to make a clean cortical window and to ensure that the bur grabs and cuts the bone at the desired location. A Steinmann pin is recommended for this step, given its far superior cutting ability.\nDab the cortical window with gauze, as light bleeding is expected.\n6. Creating the Growth Plate Injury\nCreate a drill hole injury through the central growth plate using a 1.8-mm dental bur attached to a rotary tool.\n\tNOTE: The proper depth, angle, and direction are critical in disrupting the central growth plate (Figure 1C and D). Instructions for attaining the appropriate depth, angle, and direction are given below.\n\t\nTo measure the appropriate depth using the dental bur, begin by aligning the end of the dental bur with the proximal tibia, where the semitendinosus crosses the knee capsule (Figure 1C).\nWith the end of the dental bur at the knee capsule, follow the bur shaft along the semitendinosus and make note of where the bur aligns with the cortical window. This is the appropriate depth for the bur to fully disrupt the growth plate without disrupting the articular surface (Figure 1C).\n\t\tNOTE: The dental bur is used to measure the appropriate depth. The bur may be marked with a permanent marker at the location where it aligns with the cortical window to reference the depth during drilling. However, if the anatomical markers and the above protocol are closely referenced, the first bevel on the dental burs specified here (FG6) will align appropriately with the cortical window (as seen in Figure 1C).",
    "To attain the appropriate drill angle, hold the rotary tool at an angle of less than 30° with respect to the tibial diaphysis.\n\t\tNOTE: This is a visual approximation.\nTo attain the appropriate drill direction, aim for the growth plate angle (Figure 1C). Draw a visual line along the dental bur to the growth plate angle to aid in creating a central defect.\nTurn on the rotary tool to 10,000 RPM (low speed of the rotary tool specified in the materials section) before entering the cortical window.\nWith the rotary tool at an appropriate angle and direction, enter the cortical window and push the rotary tool until the bur marker aligns with the cortical window. Once the proper depth is attained, remove the rotary tool.\n\t\tNOTE: Perform the growth plate disruption in one, quick motion, using minimal time with the bur in the growth plate in order to create a clean injury. This is important for data analysis.\nDab the cortical window with gauze for ~ 30 s, as bleeding is expected.\nEnsure the appropriate depth of the injury by again measuring the bur length (step 6.1.2).\n\t\nInsert the bur into the drill track (with the rotary tool off) and align the marked bur with the cortical window (Figure 1D).\nIf the depth is inadequate, turn the rotary tool on and push to the desired depth.\n\tNOTE: Although a second round of drilling is not ideal, fully disrupting the growth plate is paramount to the development of the bony bar.\nRinse the drill track with ~ 3 mL of sterile saline using a 10-mL syringe and a 23-gauge needle.\nDry the wound with gauze.\n7. Post-Injury Procedures",
    "If evaluating a biomaterial-based growth plate treatment, inject the biomaterial through the drill track into the injury site using an appropriately sized needle (18- to 26-gauge, depending on the biomaterial viscosity).\n\tNOTE: The volume of the growth plate injury is ~ 3 µL, and the volume of the drill track is ~ 20 µL. The maximum volume of material that can be injected into the growth plate injury and drill track is between 20 and 25 µL.\nClose the wound by suturing the fascia with 3-0 polyglycolic acid sutures. Apply bone wax over the cortical window to isolate the underlying bone (optional).\nClose the skin incision with buried sutures or wound clips.\n\tNOTE: Wound clips are recommended, as the animal will scratch at the injury site and may open the wound.\nRemove the animal from isoflurane anesthesia, place it on a warming blanket, and monitor it until it is awake.\nTo reduce the risk of infection, place the animal in a new cage containing dry, autoclaved bedding.\nAllow the animal to bear weight post-operatively.\nMonitor the animal every 12 h for 72 h after surgery to check for signs of infection, to ensure that the wound clips remain in place, and to administer postoperative analgesics in accordance with institutionally approved policies (e.g. buprenorphine at 0.05 mg/kg every 12 h for 36 h and carprofen at 5 mg/kg every 24 h for 72 h). \nRemove the wound clips 10 - 14 days post-surgery under anesthesia.\nSubscription Required.
