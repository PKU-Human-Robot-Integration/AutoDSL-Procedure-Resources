  "procedures": [
    "Inbred 8-10 weeks old male F344 and Lewis rats (200 g to 250 g) were commercially obtained. Allogeneic left kidney transplantation was performed between male F344 and Lewis rats. F344 rats were used as donors and syngeneic recipients, and Lewis rats served as allogeneic recipients. All animal handling procedures were conducted in compliance with guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by NIH, and all animal experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Chongqing University Cancer Hospital. All supplies used during surgery, including surgical instruments and solutions, are sterile. A schematic of the protocol is shown in Figure 1.\n1. Donor procedure\nInduce general anesthesia in the rat by 5% isoflurane inhalation using an induction chamber. Then, subcutaneously inject buprenorphine at 0.1 mg/kg to perform concurrent preemptive analgesia.\nPlace the rat on its back and maintain anesthesia with 2% isoflurane inhalation using a facemask over its nose and mouth. Apply eye lubricant onto the eyes to avoid drying of the cornea. Slow respiratory rate and rhythm, the disappearance of corneal reflex, and lack of response to the toe pinch indicate the effectiveness of anesthesia.\nShave the abdominal hair with an electric razor and sterilize the skin using 0.5% iodine and 70% alcohol.\nSubcutaneously inject 0.5% lidocaine along the midline from the symphysis pubis to subxiphoid for local analgesics, and then incise the abdomen and pull open the incision using a retractor.\nTake out the intestines from the right side of the incision and wrap them up with moistened gauze to prevent them from drying out. Then, expose the left kidney.",
    "Segregate fat tissues from the left kidney and ureter using cotton swabs, and then dissociate the left renal artery and vein using the micro-forceps under an operating microscope with 20x magnification. Coagulate any bleeding using electrocoagulation, if necessary.\nPerform ligation of the aorta approximately 5 mm above the left renal artery with a 4-0 polyamide monofilament suture. Then, transect the left renal vein distal to the conjunction of the left genital vein and adrenal vein.\nFlush the kidney with ice-cold UW solution supplemented with heparin (100 U/mL) using a 24 G scalp needle from the aorta below the left renal artery until blood fades in color. Warm ischemia time is 5 min on average.\nAfter transecting the left renal artery approximately 2 mm next to the aorta, dissociate the kidney and ureter with the help of micro-forceps (preserve the peripheral connective tissues to ensure blood supply to the ureter). Then, transect the ureter next to the bladder and preserve the donor left kidney in ice-cold UW solution.\nSacrifice the donor rat with loss of blood by transecting the aorta and subsequently placing it into a CO2 box to ensure death.\n2. Recipient procedure\nRepeat the procedure described in steps 1.1-1.5 for the recipient rat.\nDissociate the left kidney and ureter as well as the left renal artery and renal vein of the recipient rat using cotton swabs and micro-forceps under an operating microscope with 20x magnification.\nClip the left renal artery and renal vein at the root by noninvasive micro-vascular clamps. Ligate the left ureter approximately 2-3 cm below the kidney with an 8-0 polyamide monofilament suture and transect it at ligation.",
    "Resect the recipient's native left kidney by transecting the left renal artery 2 mm away from the micro-vascular clamp, and transecting the renal vein proximal to the conjunction of the left genital vein and adrenal vein. Coagulate the adrenal vein using electrocoagulation, if necessary.\nImplant the donor kidney into the left renal fossa of the recipient rat and put ice around the implanted donor kidney. Anastomose the donor's renal artery and renal vein to the recipient's renal artery and renal vein in an end-to-end pattern using 10-0 polyamide monofilament sutures under an operating microscope with 45x magnification, as follows.\nAnastomose the renal artery with interrupted sutures.\n\t\nPlace the stay sutures at 12 and 6 o'clock positions of anastomosis, respectively. Equidistantly suture one side of the anastomosis between the two stay sutures with 2-3 stitches using a 10-0 Polyamide Monofilament suture.\nTurn over the stay sutures and similarly suture the other side of the anastomosis between the two stay sutures with 2-3 stitches.\nAnastomose the renal vein with continuous sutures.\n\t\nPlace the stay sutures at 6 and 12 o'clock positions of anastomosis, respectively. Suture one side of the anastomosis from the 12 o'clock position with 4-5 stitches using the running sutures, and then tie the running suture to the stay suture at the 6 o'clock position with a 10-0 polyamide monofilament suture.\nTurn over the stay sutures and similarly suture the other side of the anastomosis from the 6 o'clock position, and finally tie the running suture to the stay suture at the 12 o'clock position.\nRe-perfuse the donor kidney by releasing the noninvasive micro-vascular clamp of the renal vein first; then, identify the bleeding sites and make additional stitches.",
    "Release the noninvasive micro-vascular clamp of the renal artery, identify the bleeding sites and make additional stitches. Cold ischemia time is 45 min on average.\nStitch the end of the donor ureter with a 4-0 polyamide monofilament suture as a tow to drag the end through the \"tunnel\" of the recipient's bladder under an operating microscope with 20x magnification. Afterward, transect the end of the donor ureter with the suture outside the recipient's bladder. Let the donor ureter shrink back into the recipient's bladder.\nFix the donor ureter with the recipient's bladder by stitching the adventitia of the donor ureter with the muscle layer of the recipient's bladder outside at four equidistant positions using an 8-0 polyamide monofilament suture under an operating microscope with 45x magnification.\nPlace the intestines back into the abdominal cavity and close the abdominal incision with continuous sutures in the muscle layer first and then the skin layer with a 4-0 polyamide monofilament suture.\nPlace the recipient rat on a 37°C heating pad in a dry and clean cage. Wait until the rat recovers from anesthesia.\nSubcutaneously inject buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) into the recipient rat every 6 h for 48 h for post-operative analgesia. Intramuscularly inject penicillin (50,000 U/kg) into the recipient rat once a day for 3 days for prevention of infection. The recipient rat is sacrificed by placing it into a CO2 box to observe the chronic rejection of renal allograft after 10 weeks of transplantation.\nSubscription Required.
