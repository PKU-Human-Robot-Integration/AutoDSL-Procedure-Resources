    "Order 8-week-old female C57BL/6N mice from Taconic Biosciences.Upon arrival, group house mice (3-4/cage) with beta chip bedding, Isopro food, a water bottle, and an igloo. Place cages in a temperature-controlled room dedicated exclusively to ABA testing, with the white noise machine turned ‘on’ high to minimize exposure to animal facility noise. Set the light timers to the 12-h light/dark cycle that will be used throughout the duration of the experiment. If the overhead lights cannot be controlled by a timer, turn them ‘off’ and control the light cycle with external fluorescent light fixtures (18-22 inch) plugged into a mechanical timer. The number of lights required will be determined by the size of the room. Two fluorescent lights are adequate for a room with 2 racks containing a total of 30 cages.Allow animals one week to acclimate with unlimited access to food and water.Start the experiment (one week after arrival)Weigh and allocate mice to one of four groups, counterbalancing weights across the groups. Information gained by testing each group is outlined in the Notes on Data Analysis section.Activity-based anorexia (ABA, freely moving running wheel, food restriction)Food-restricted control group (FR, locked wheel, food restriction)Wheel control group (WH, freely moving running wheel, unlimited food)Homecage control group (HC, locked wheel, unlimited food)Individually/singly house mice with either a freely moving running wheel (ABA and WH groups) or a wheel locked with a pin (FR and HC groups). Provide food and water to all groups ad libitum.Cage set-up: Remove all scents by wiping down each piece of the running wheel with a Clorox® wipe and drying with a paper towel. Place the base of the wheel flat against the bottom of the cage and cover with bedding. Orient the wire lid so that mice can access food or water without sitting on the wheel (Figure 1A).",
    "Verify that the wheel does not touch the wire lid and can freely turn (Figure 1B and Video 1). Limit the amount of bedding used so that a build-up of bedding underneath the wheel will not prevent it from turning.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4009/bioprotoc-11-09-4009-g001.jpgFigure 1. Overhead (A) and side (B) view of a running wheel inside a cage. Arrow indicates the space between the wire lid and the tip of the wheel.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Representative video of a mouse running on the wheel. Note that the water bottle and food were removed for illustrative purposes.Wheel set-up: Identify mice on the computer (Wheel Manager software) one at a time. Turn on one running wheel (top switch), enter the corresponding mouse ID into the computer, place the wheel in the cage, and then place the mouse in the cage with Isopro food and water before turning on the next wheel. After all IDs have been entered, click ‘Start Acquisition’ under the File menu.Baseline Data Collection (3 days):Baseline Day 1: Two days after individually housing the mice (Figure 2A), weigh the mice and food immediately prior to onset of the dark cycle. Different containers should be used (mouse only and food only) so that faeces and urine do not come into contact with the food. To minimize the number of times that each cage is moved, weigh the mouse and then the food from the same cage. When removing the mouse from the cage, place a finger on the running wheel to prevent it from rotating.Baseline Day 2: Follow the same procedure as the previous day.Baseline Day 3: Follow the same procedure as the previous day. Subsequently, remove the food from the ABA and FR groups 2 h after onset of the dark cycle.",
    "If the room does not contain an overhead red light, enter the room wearing a red headlamp so that the light/dark cycle is not disturbed.ABA Data Collection (10 days):Preparation: Each day, record the weight of large pellets of food (9-11 g) to the nearest 0.01 g for each ABA and FR mouse. Use fresh pellets in the event that a scent was left behind the previous day. Store food at room temperature in cups/containers labeled with the mouse ID and cover with foil.Immediately prior to onset of the dark cycle, weigh all the mice and food in HC and WH groups.Backup data without interrupting data collection by clicking ‘Export Data’ under the File menu.Place the labeled food containers in front of the corresponding cages.Once the lights have turned off, place the pre-weighed pellets in the overhead food bin of the ABA and FR mice and then leave the room for 2 h. Wear a red headlamp while administering the food, if necessary.Calculate the % baseline (%B) bodyweight by dividing the current weight by the bodyweight recorded on baseline day 3 and multiplying by 100. Any mouse that is at 75% of the baseline weight or lower is at risk of death and must be removed from the experiment.After 2 h of food availability (first 2-h of the dark cycle), remove the food pellets from the mice in the ABA and FR groups, place in the labeled containers, and cover with foil. Do not turn on the overhead lights when entering the ABA room; wear a red headlamp, if necessary. While in the room, fill the food bin (~40 g food) of mice that require removal from the experiment (≥ 25% bodyweight loss).Record the post-intake weights of food pellets to 0.",
    "01 g for the ABA and FR groups and calculate the intake during the 2-h period of food availability for each mouse. Throw away partially eaten food and weigh fresh food the next day.Repeat the steps above every day for 10 consecutive days.On ABA day 10, remove all remaining mice from the experiment after 2 h of unlimited access to food."
