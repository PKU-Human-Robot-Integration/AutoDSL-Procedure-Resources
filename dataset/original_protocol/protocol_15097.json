    "A schematic overview of the protocol is presented in Figure 1.\n1. Processing of Human HCC Samples\nObtain primary human HCC specimens with written patient consent and with the approval of the institutional research ethics board. These protocols have been carried out at our institution with approval from the University Health Network Research Ethics Board in compliance with all institutional, national, and international guidelines for human welfare.\nCollect fresh HCC specimens as soon as possible following the surgical procedure once appropriate samples have been taken for clinical purposes. Ideally this should take place within 30 min after removal of the tissue from the patient. As illustrated in Figure 2, a sample of at least 1 cm3 obtained from the periphery of the tumor is optimal, as the central portion of the tumor may be necrotic. Tumors that have not received any treatment prior to resection such as radiation, chemotherapy, or ablation are preferred in order to maximize the chance that tumor cells are viable. Handle primary human tissues in accordance with standard personal protective protocols for biohazardous material. Perform all laboratory manipulations of tumor tissues and cell preparations in a class II biosafety cabinet using aseptic techniques.\nPlace the fresh HCC sample in 10-25 ml serum-free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium/Ham's F12 at 4 °C and transfer on ice to the laboratory for immediate processing and preparation of tissue fragments and/or cells for xenografting into mice.\nUsing sterile forceps, place the tumor sample in a 100 mm x 20 mm Petri dish or other suitable sterile working surface. Divide the tumor sample into fragments of approximately 2-3 mm3 using a No.10 surgical scalpel blade. At this point, consider snap-freezing or formalin-fixing some tumor fragments for other experiments or analyses as required.",
    "For xenografting of tumor fragments, place some of the HCC fragments into one or more microcentrifuge tubes containing enough Matrigel to allow the fragments to remain submerged. Keep these tubes on ice.\nFor preparation of a tumor cell suspension, use the surgical scalpel blade to mince the remaining HCC tissue as much as possible and mix with 5-10 ml of DMEM-F12 in a 50 ml conical tube depending on the volume of the minced tissue.\nAdd collagenase type IV and dispase II at final concentrations of 200 units/ml and 0.8 units/ml respectively. Pipette the mixture up and down well using a 25 ml pipette.\nSeal the tube and incubate the mixture from step 1.6 at 37 °C in a 5% carbon dioxide incubator for 30-60 min depending on the softness of the tumor tissue. Pipette the mixture up and down a few times every 10 min to assess the progress of the enzymatic digestion.\nAfter digestion is complete, pass the tumor solution through a 100 μm cell strainer. Gently mash the remaining tissue on the cell strainer using a 25 ml pipette tip to enable the maximum number of tumor cells to pass through. Collect the strained cell suspension in a 15 ml conical tube.\nCentrifuge the tumor cell suspension at 1,200 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C.\nGently decant the supernatant. Depending on the size of the pellet, add 2-5 ml of ice cold 1x red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer and gently pipette up and down to resuspend the pellet. Keep on ice for 5 min.\nAdd DMEM-F12 to a total volume of 15 ml and centrifuge at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C to wash out the RBC lysis buffer.\nGently decant the supernatant and resuspend the RBC-free tumor cell pellet in DMEM-F12.",
    "Count the viable cells using trypan blue exclusion either manually or with an automated cell counter.\nCentrifuge tumor cell aliquots containing the desired number of cells for injection as described above, resuspend the resulting cell pellet in 30 μl of ice-cold Matrigel, and store on ice.\nOptional: After step 1.11, we routinely deplete human CD45+ cells (leukocytes) from the bulk tumor cell suspension and/or purify subsets of tumor cells using flow cytometry or immunomagnetic beads. Detailed protocols for these techniques are well described by the manufacturers of the relevant antibodies, beads, and flow cytometers.\nNote: The protocol described above can also be used to process human tumor xenografts harvested from mice in order to perform serial transplantation, substituting the xenograft tissue for the primary human HCC tissue in step 1.1. In this situation, after step 1.11, we routinely deplete infiltrating murine cells from the cell suspension using an antibody against the mouse histocompatibility antigen H2k.\n2. Xenografting\nConduct all animal procedures in compliance with protocols approved by the institutional animal care committee. The procedures described herein have been completed under a specific Animal Use Protocol approved by the University Health Network Animal Care Committee in accordance and compliance with all relevant regulatory and institutional agencies, regulations, and guidelines.",
    "Equipment for delivery of inhalational volatile anesthetic agents to small animals should be utilized according to standard operating procedures of the animal facility and research institute. Carry out all surgical procedures using aseptic technique and sterile instruments in a class II biosafety cabinet. Utilize non-obese diabetic severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) or NOD/SCID/interleukin 2 receptor gamma chain null (NSG) strains of mice of either sex at 6-8 weeks of age (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) 9,10. These mice must be housed and maintained in a facility capable of providing pathogen-free conditions suitable for immunodeficient animals.\nPrepare mice for surgery in a chamber supplying 5% (v/v) inhaled Isoflurane in 1 L/min of oxygen. Maintain anesthesia until there is loss of corneal and toe reflex in the animal(s). For subcutaneous xenografting, shave one or more small areas on the dorsum of the animal(s) and cleanse the skin with 70% ethanol. For intrahepatic xenografting, shave the ventral thorax and abdomen of the animal(s) from the axillae down to the inguinal region and cleanse the skin with 70% ethanol.\n2.1 Subcutaneous Implantation of Tumor Fragments\nPlace the anesthetized mouse prone, maintaining inhalational Isoflurane anesthesia (2% (v/v) in 1 L/min O2) with a mouthpiece. Apply Tear-Gel to protect the animal's eyes from traumatic injury.\nSterilize the dorsal shaved area(s) with Betadine surgical scrub followed by 70% ethanol and lastly with povidone-iodine solution.\nMake a 5 mm skin incision using sterile sharp scissors.\nInsert a closed blunt scissor gently into the subcutaneous space and spread gently to develop a pocket large enough to accommodate a tumor fragment.\nInsert the tumor fragment prepared in step 1.3 into the subcutaneous pocket using sterile fine forceps.\nClose the skin incision using sutures or clips.\nProvide postoperative care to the mouse as described below.\n2.2 Subcutaneous injection of tumor cells",
    "Prepare the animal as described in steps 2.1.1 and 2.1.2.\nLoad the suspension of tumor cells in Matrigel prepared in step 1.13 into an insulin syringe with a 29 G 1/2 in needle.\nInsert the needle into the subcutaneous space and discharge the contents of the syringe. Advancing the needle several millimetres along the subcutaneous plane away from the skin puncture site prevents leakage of the tumor cell suspension out of the puncture site upon withdrawal of the needle.\nProvide postoperative care to the mouse as described below.\n2.3 Intrahepatic Implantation of Tumor Fragments\nUsing a 27 G 1/2 in needle on a 1 ml syringe, administer 350 μl of sterile normal saline solution subcutaneously in the dorsum of the anesthetized animal's neck to compensate for intraoperative fluid losses. For analgesia, administer 350 μl of sterile normal saline containing buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) subcutaneously on the animal's flank, using a 27 G 1/2-in needle on a 1 ml syringe.\nPlace the mouse supine on a pre-heated pad with the nose and mouth positioned inside the mouthpiece to deliver maintenance inhalational Isoflurane anesthesia (2% (v/v) in 1 L/min O2).\nExtend the limbs and secure them with tape to the operating surface to optimize exposure of the ventral abdomen and thorax.\nPerform the procedure under a magnifying lamp to optimize visualization.\nSterilize the shaved skin on the ventral abdomen and thorax with Betadine surgical scrub followed by 70% ethanol and lastly with povidone-iodine solution.\nUsing sterile sharp scissors, make a transverse bilateral subcostal skin incision and divide the muscle layers to enter the peritoneal cavity to allow adequate exposure of the entire liver.\nPlace a stitch in the skin above the xiphoid process and secure it to the mouthpiece with tape in order to allow better exposure of the liver and surrounding structures.",
    "Use two cotton-tipped applicators adjacent and posterior to the liver to stabilize it.\nMake an incision 3 mm in length and depth on the surface of the liver using a sterile No. 10 scalpel blade.\nImmediately apply Surgicel and gentle pressure to the incision site to achieve hemostasis; remove after 60-90 sec and proceed only if complete hemostasis has been achieved.\nPlace a tumor fragment step 1.3 into the liver incision with sterile fine forceps or with an 18 G needle.\nApply a small piece of Surgicel over the liver incision to prevent displacement of the tumor fragment and ensure continued hemostasis.\nClose the incision with sutures or clips.\nProvide postoperative care as described below\n2.4 Intrahepatic Implantation of Tumor Cells via Direct Injection into the Liver\nPrepare the mouse as described in Steps 2.3.1 to 2.3.7 above.\nLoad the tumor cell suspension (prepared in step 1.13) into an insulin syringe using a 29 G 1/2 in needle.\nWith the liver stabilized using a cotton-tip applicator, insert the insulin syringe needle into the liver and advance the tip a few millimetres beyond the puncture site along a subcapsular plane.\nGently discharge the contents of the syringe and then remove the needle from the liver.\nPlace Surgicel over the puncture site and apply gentle pressure with a cotton-tipped applicator to prevent leakage of the tumor cell suspension and to achieve complete hemostasis.\nClose the incision with sutures or clips and provide postoperative care as described below.\n2.5 Intrahepatic Xenografting of Tumor Cells via Injection into the Spleen\nPrepare the mouse as described in steps 2.3.1 to 2.3.5 above.\nUsing sterile sharp scissors, make a 1 cm left subcostal incision to enter the peritoneal cavity.",
    "Use a cotton-tipped applicator to reflect the stomach cranially and to the animal's right side in order to expose the spleen.\nBy handling the surrounding adipose tissues with sterile fine atraumatic forceps, deliver the spleen into the incision and place a cotton-tipped applicator behind the spleen to stabilize it.\nUsing 5-0 silk suture, place a loose pre-tied knot around the spleen above the lower pole.\nLoad the tumor cell suspension (prepared in step 1.13) into an insulin syringe using a 29 G 1/2 in needle.\nInsert the insulin syringe needle into the lower pole of the spleen and advance it past the level of the loose pre-tied knot.\nSlowly discharge the contents of the syringe, remove the needle from the spleen, and tighten the knot to prevent any leakage of the injected tumor cell suspension.\nReplace the spleen into the peritoneal cavity.\nClose the incision with sutures or clips and provide postoperative care as described below.\n2.6 Partial Hepatectomy to Facilitate Intrahepatic Engraftment of Human Tumor Tissue\nPrepare the mouse as described in steps 2.3.1 to 2.3.7.\nWith sterile sharp scissors, divide the falciform ligament attached to the median lobe of the liver.\nUsing a cotton-tipped applicator, mobilize the left lobe of the liver and position a loose pre-tied knot of 5-0 silk suture around the left lobe. Advance the loose knot as close as possible towards the bilio-vascular pedicle of the left lobe and tighten the knot.\nExcise the left lobe distal to the ligature using sterile scissors, leaving a small stump to prevent slippage of the knot and subsequent hemorrhage.\nUsing a similar technique, ligate and resect the majority of the median lobe of the liver, avoiding the gallbladder.",
    "Use Surgicel and gentle pressure with a cotton-tipped applicator along the cut surfaces of the liver parenchyma to achieve complete hemostasis.\nFor intrahepatic xenografting of a tumor fragment or tumor cells, proceed with steps 2.3.8 to 2.3.11 or 2.4.2 to 2.4.5 as described above.\nFor intrahepatic xenografting of tumor cells via splenic injection, utilize cotton-tipped applicators to gently reflect the stomach cranially and to the animal's right side, exposing the spleen. Proceed with steps 2.5.4 to 2.5.9 as described above.\nClose the incision with sutures or clips and provide postoperative care as described below.\n2.7 Postoperative Care\nRemove the mouse from the inhalational anesthesia mouthpiece.\nPlace the mouse in a cage under a heat lamp for approximately 20 min until recovered from anesthesia and mobilizing fully.\nRepeat the buprenorphine dose every 8-12 hr during the first 2-3 postoperative days.\nSubscription Required.
