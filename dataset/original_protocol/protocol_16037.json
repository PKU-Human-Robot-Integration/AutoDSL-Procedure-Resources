    "Here, the designed guide RNAs (see Strategic Planning) will be used to create an oligonucleotide-based sgRNA DNA template (i.e., a minigene). The minigene will then be subjected to PCR, and the user will perform T7-mediated in vitro transcription to obtain the purified sgRNAs. These sgRNAs can then be used with the Cas9 enzyme for specific genomic DNA cleavage. We also describe a protocol for the preparation of genomic DNA in solution from suspension cells.\nAt the end of this protocol, the user will have genomic DNA that is ready to use for TAR cloning (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.207#cpz1207-prot-0002]).\nMaterials\n5× HF buffer (New England Biolabs, cat. no.

Before transferring the white thread-like DNA, prepare a 1.7-ml microcentrifuge tube with 1 ml of 70% ethanol.\n51. Transfer the white thread-like strands of DNA from step 50 using a 200-µl pipette tip into the 1.7-ml microcentrifuge tube with 1 ml of 70% ethanol.\nThe white thread-like strands of DNA are very sticky, so be very careful when transferring the DNA.\n52. Invert the tube 10 times and carefully remove the 70% ethanol.\nDNA will precipitate to the bottom of the tube. Remove the ethanol carefully using a micropipette.\n53. Add 1 ml of 70% ethanol and invert 10 times. Then, remove as much 70% ethanol possible without touching the white thread-like strands of DNA.\n54. Allow the genomic DNA to air dry for 5 min.\n55.

    "Here, the user will perform TAR cloning, which involves isolation of a genomic region of interest via the TAR vector using homologous recombination in yeast. First, the user will prepare highly competent yeast spheroplasts, and then transform these with genomic DNA that has been pre-treated with CRISPR/Cas9 (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.207#cpz1207-prot-0001]), along with a TAR vector linearized between the hooks homologous to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the region of interest. TAR cloning will produce a library of yeast colonies. The user will then screen the yeast colonies by PCR with diagnostic primers specific to the region of interest.

Streak the host yeast strain VL6-48N on a YPD plate to isolate single colonies. Grow at 30°C.\n2. One day before the TAR cloning experiment, place 50-ml aliquots of YPD medium in three separate 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks. Inoculate each flask with different-size single colonies from the freshly streaked VL6-48N and grow the cultures overnight (for 14-16 hr) at 30°C with vigorous shaking (200-300 rpm), to assure good aeration.\nThe user inoculates three flasks to ensure that at least one of them will be ready to use the next morning",
    "3. The following morning, measure the optical density of the cultures every 20-30 min. Choose the flask with an OD660 of 2.0-4.0.\nTo measure, prepare a 1/10 dilution of the culture in water; the density should be between 0.2 and 0.4.\nThe culture with an OD660 of 2.0-4.0 is ready for the preparation of highly competent spheroplasts. This optical density corresponds to approximately 2 × 107 cells per ml.\n4. Transfer the yeast culture from this flask into a 50-ml conical tube and pellet the cells by centrifugation for 5 min at 1000 × g, 5°C. Remove and discard the supernatant.\n5. Resuspend the cell pellet in 30 ml of sterile water by vortexing and centrifuge 5 min at 3000 × g, 5°C. Remove and discard the supernatant.\n6. Resuspend the cell pellet in 20 ml of 1 M sorbitol by vortexing and centrifuge 5 min at 3000 × g, 5°C. Remove and discard the supernatant.\nYeast cells in 1 M sorbitol may be kept overnight.\n7. Resuspend the cell pellet in 20 ml of SPE solution. Add 20 μl of 10 mg/ml Zymolyase solution and 40 μl of 14.3 M 2-ME, and mix well. Incubate at 30°C for ∼ 20 min with slow shaking (∼100 rpm).\n8. Check the level of spheroplasting by comparing the optical densities of the cell suspension in 1 M sorbitol versus 2% SDS. To do this, take two 200-μl aliquots of the Zymolyase-treated cell suspension and dilute 10-fold in 1 M sorbitol and 2% SDS, respectively. The spheroplasts are determined to be ready when the difference between the sorbitol and SDS OD660 readings is 3- to 5-fold (e.g., OD = 0.844 vs. OD = 0.187).\nThis step indicates if the spheroplasts are ready for transformation. SDS lyses the spheroplasts but not intact cells.",
    "Note that the optical density reading for the sorbitol samples should be no less than 1.5. If this value is lower, the spheroplasts have been overexposed to Zymolyase and cannot be used. Both underexposure and overexposure to Zymolyase greatly affect transformation efficiency. From this point on, extreme care must be taken to avoid lysing the delicate spheroplasts: very slow, gentle resuspensions are necessary.\n9. Centrifuge the spheroplasts 10 min at 570 × g, 5°C. Decant the supernatant, add 50 ml of 1.0 M sorbitol, and then rock very gently to resuspend the pellet. Pellet the spheroplasts again by centrifugation for 10 min at 300-600 × g, 5°C.\n10. Repeat the wash with 50 ml of 1 M sorbitol one more time and gently resuspend the final pellet in 2.0 ml of STC solution.\nThe spheroplasts are ready for transformation and are stable at room temperature for at least 1 hr.\nTransformation of spheroplasts by genomic DNA along with a TAR vector linearized between the hooks\n11. Take 200 μl of the spheroplast suspension (step 10) and mix gently with 1-2 μg of genomic DNA pre-treated by CRISPR/Cas9 (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.207#cpz1207-prot-0001], step 62) and 1.0 μg of the linearized TAR vector in a 2.0-ml tube. Incubate for 10 min at room temperature.\nSince each transformation will require 200 μl of the spheroplast suspension (from step 10), each suspension is enough for 10 transformations.\n12. Add 800 μl of PEG 8000 to each mix, gently mix by inverting, and incubate for 10 min at room temperature.\n13. Pellet the spheroplasts by centrifugation for 5 min at 300-500 × g, 5°C. Remove the supernatant and gently resuspend the spheroplasts in each tube with 800 μl of SOS solution.\n14. Incubate the spheroplasts for 40 min at 30°C without shaking.",
    "15. Transfer the spheroplasts from each tube into a 15-ml conical tube containing 7.0 ml of melted TOP SORB-agar-His (equilibrated at 50°C), gently mix, and then quickly pour the agar mix onto a SORB-His plate.\n16. Keep the plates at 30°C for 5-7 days until transformants become visible.\nIdentification of individual gene-positive clones\nTypically, 20-35 out of 100 primary His+ transformant colonies obtained contain the sequence of interest. To identify sequence-positive colonies, primary transformants are examined for the presence of the region of interest by PCR using a pair of primers specific for some of its internal sequences (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.207#cpz1207-fig-0002]).\n17. Streak ∼50 primary transformants (from step 16) using toothpicks onto new SD-His plates (see Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.207#cpz1207-fig-0002]).\n18. Incubate the plates with transformants at 30°C overnight.\n19. Touch the streak of each His+ transformant with a sterile disposable pipette tip and then rinse the tip thoroughly in 100 μl of a mixture containing 80 μl of water, 20 μl of Zymolyase solution, and 1 μl of 2-ME.\n20. Incubate the resulting suspension for 1 hr at 30°C.\n21. Add 10 μl of 2% SDS. Incubate for 15 min at 70°C.\n22. Add 10 μl of 5 M KAc and let the tubes sit on ice for 15 min.\n23. Spin 2 min at 20,800 × g, room temperature.\n24. Transfer the supernatant to a new 1.7-ml tube and add an equal volume of isopropanol. Microcentrifuge at maximum speed for 5 min to bring down the precipitate.\n25. Dissolve the pellets in 30 μl water.",
    "26. Use 1 μl of the DNA solution in a 50-μl PCR reaction (see Current Protocols article: Kuslich, Chui, & Yamashiro, 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.207#cpz1207-bib-0042]) with appropriate diagnostic primers and separate the PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis (see Current Protocols article: Armstrong & Schulz, 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.207#cpz1207-bib-0003]) to identify gene-positive clones (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.207#cpz1207-fig-0002]).\n27. Store the positive clones streaked on the plates at 4°C.\nThe gene-positive yeast transformants may be kept at 4°C for at least 3 weeks.",
    "Here, the user will transfer the TAR/YAC/BAC containing the DNA region of interest, obtained in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.207#cpz1207-prot-0002], from yeast to E. coli. If the size of the TAR-cloned DNA is less than 50 kb, DNA isolated from the region-positive yeast clones (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.207#cpz1207-prot-0002], step 25) may be directly transformed into E. coli following standard procedures. If the size of the region of interest is larger than 50 kb; however, the user will need to prepare DNA in agarose plugs before transforming E. coli by electroporation, and this approach is described below.\nMaterials\nSequence-positive yeast clones (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.207#cpz1207-prot-0002])\nSD-His plates (Teknova, cat. no.

    "Preparation of YAC/BAC DNAs in agarose plugs for electroporation\n1. Streak sequence-positive His+ transformants (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.207#cpz1207-prot-0002]) on SD-His plates, grow overnight, and inoculate five colonies separately in 5 ml of YPD medium in 50-ml conical tubes. Grow overnight at 30°C with vigorous shaking (200-300 rpm).\n2. Pellet the cells by centrifugation. Remove and discard the supernatant.\n3. Resuspend the cells from each colony in 100 μl of EDTA solution. Mix well by vortexing.\n4. Transfer the mix into 1.5-ml tubes. Add 100 μl of Zymolyase solution, vortex the cells for 4 s, and incubate the suspension for 30 min at 37°C.\n5. Melt 1% LMP agarose (∼10 ml in the bottle), then take 1 ml and transfer it into a 2-ml tube.\n6. Keep the tube with the melted agarose in a 50°C water bath to cool.\n7. Transfer the 2-ml tube from step 5 and the resuspended cells (from step 4) to a 42°C heat block. Equilibrate for 15 min.\n8. Add an equal volume of the melted agarose to the cell suspension (i.e., take 100 μl of the melted agarose per 100 μl of the cell suspension for each sequence-positive colony) and mix well by vortexing. Keep the cell/agarose suspension at 42°C.\nIt is important that the final concentration of agarose be equal to 0.5%. With a higher concentration of agarose, it is impossible to completely melt the plugs for electroporation.\n9. Take 50-μl aliquots of the cell/agarose suspension and gently place each into a separate ultra micro pipette tip. Keep the tips horizontal for 10 min at 5°C until the agarose is completely solidified.",
    "10. Transfer the agarose plugs (for each sequence-positive colony) into 2-ml tubes. To do this, take up LET solution in a 6-cc syringe without a needle, place the tip of the ultra micro pipette tip into the syringe luer, and gently apply pressure. The plug should slide out into the 2-ml tube. Incubate the agarose plugs for 1 hr at 37°C.\nFour 50-μl plugs can be made for each sequence-positive colony.\n11. Remove LET and add enough NDS cell lysis buffer to cover the plugs. Incubate the plugs for 1 hr at 55°C.\n12. Remove the NDS solution carefully and wash the plugs five times with 2 ml of EDTA mix (just add and remove).\nTo wash the plugs, add 1-2 ml of EDTA mix into each 2-ml tube with the plugs, mix gently, keep the tubes for 20 min at room temperature, and then remove the EDTA mix and add 1-2 ml of fresh EDTA mix again. Repeat this step five times. Dialyzed plugs may be stored at 4°C in EDTA mix for several months.\nElectroporation the YAC/BACs into E. coli cells\n13. The day before electroporation, take one plug for each sequence-positive colony and place into a 2-ml tube with water. Incubate the plugs in water overnight at room temperature.\n14. Melt the plugs by placing the tube with the plugs at 68°C for 15 min, then cool them to 42°C for 10 min. Treat each plug with 1.5 U of agarase for 1 hr at 42°C. Chill the treated plugs on ice for 10 min.\n15. Dilute the treated plug mix two-fold with sterile water.",
    "16. Use 1 μl of the mixture to electroporate 20 μl of the E. coli DH10B competent cells using a BioRad Gene Pulser with the settings 2.5 kV, 200  Ω, and 25 μF.\n17. After electroporation, add 1 ml of SOC to the cuvette, mix well by pipetting up and down, and then transfer the mix into a microcentrifuge tube.\n18. Incubate the cells for 1 hr at 37°C without agitation.\n19. Spread 30, 100, and 300 μl of the cell suspension onto three separate LB-Cm plates.\n20. Incubate the plates at 37°C overnight.\n21. Streak 5-10 CmR colonies onto a LB-Cm plate.\n22. Isolate BAC DNAs from three colonies using the BAC DNA Isolation kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nFor BACs with a size of ∼100 kb, the yield of chloramphenicol-resistant transformants varies from 30 to 200 colonies per plate. The yield is lower for larger-sized BACs. With BACs larger than 200 kb, the integrity of the material in E. coli should be checked. To check the size of the BACs in bacterial cells, the BAC DNAs are linearized by a unique restriction endonuclease and then checked using contour-clamped homogeneous electric field (CHEF) electrophoresis.
