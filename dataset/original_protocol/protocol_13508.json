    "The procedures for the care and use of laboratory animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Guangdong Laboratory Animals Monitoring Institute. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8th Ed., 2011, National Research Council, USA). The surgical procedure is shown in Figure 1.\n1. Preoperative preparation of animals\nRandomly divide 10 3-month-old male minipigs weighing 30-35 kg into the sham group (n = 5) and VGD group (n = 5).\nEvaluate the preoperative and postoperative health conditions of the pigs using the body mass index (BMI). Calculate the BMI as follows:\n\tBMI = body weight (kg)/(body length [cm] × body length [cm])\n\tNOTE: Body length is measured from the pig's nose to the base of the tail.\nFast the animals for 12 h before surgery to avoid aspiration after anesthesia. Prepare anesthesia appliances and surgical instruments, including an anesthesia machine, gas, anesthetic drugs, an anesthesia pipeline, a special laryngoscope, and surgical instruments, a rib retainer, sutures, a thyroid retractor, surgical forceps, etc. Sterilize all instruments to be used in the surgery.\n2. Preparing the animals for surgery\nWeigh the animals and calculate the anesthetic dose. Administer intramuscularly the anesthetic mixture comprising 2 mg/kg of 1:1 Tiletamine and Zolazepam, 0.2 mg/kg diazepam, and 0.02 mg/kg atropine17. Use fentanyl (50 mg/kg) for intraoperative pain relief30.\nEnsure that a proper anesthetic plane is achieved and insert an indwelling venous catheter (20G) into the marginal ear vein to establish ear access. Transfer the pig onto the operation table and place it in the supine position. Immobilize the limbs with bandages and elevate the head with a sterile drape.",
    "NOTE: The state of anesthesia was monitored by central fixation of the eyeball, miosis, loss of pupillary reflex, and loss of pain reflex.  The heart rate and blood pressure were maintained at a lower level than the baseline. The surgeon should monitor HR, BP, and other parameters under paralysis and increase the anesthetic dose if HR increases > 20% above baseline.\nExpose the epiglottis and glottis using a veterinary laryngoscope. Perform tracheal intubation with a 7.0-7.5Fr tube and connect it to the anesthesia breathing circuit.\n\tNOTE: The ventilator is used for continuous positive pressure ventilation with tidal volume 280 mL, inspiratory/expiratory ratio 1:2, respiratory rate 20 times/min, and positive end-expiratory pressure (5 cm H2O).\nIntravenously inject vecuronium bromide (0.1 mg/kg) to relax the muscles during the surgical procedures and use 2% isoflurane to maintain anesthesia at a respiratory rate of 16-20 bpm and a tidal volume of 10 mL/kg.\n\tNOTE: Vecuronium is given to ensure adequate depth of anesthesia in paralyzed animals, especially since the dose of induction drug and isoflurane is on the lower end of recommended.\nUse vet ointment on the pig's eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia. Use electric blankets to maintain the pig's body temperature at 38 °C ± 5 °C.\nUse an electrocardiogram to monitor heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and body temperature.\n3. Surgical procedures\nShave the left chest wall and apply three alternating rounds of 0.7% iodine and 75% alcohol to aseptically prepare the surgical area up to the left mandibular angle, down to the umbilical cord, left to the posterior axillary line, and right to the axillary front. Place a sterile surgical drape around the surgical area.",
    "Make a 7-10 cm transverse incision with an electric knife in the third left intercostal space and separate the subcutaneous tissues layer by layer (Figure 2A). Remove a 5-6 cm segment of the third rib with bone scissors and expose the internal mammary vein by a retractor after exposing the third rib-sternal joint (Figure 2B).\nLocate the internal mammary vein along with the left internal mammary artery on the left side of the sternum. Perform a blunt dissection of the internal mammary vein with vascular forceps.\nPerform hemostasis by electrocoagulation of the branches of the left internal mammary vein with an electric knife. If hemostasis is incomplete, use cotton thread ligation for hemostasis. Ligate and mark the two ends of the vein while it is being harvested (Figure 2C).\nPrepare heparin normal saline by adding 2 mL of heparin sodium solution and 98 mL of normal saline. After removing the vein, inject heparin normal saline into the vein for pretreatment (Figure 2D). Then, put the vein into normal saline and keep it for backup.\nMake a similar incision as described above and remove the internal mammary vein in the sham group. Open the pericardium, then close the chest wall in the sham group. Use the internal mammary vein of the sham group for pathological control without coronary artery bypass grafting.\nMake a ~7 cm incision with an electric knife on the pericardium to expose the right coronary artery trunk. Suspend the pericardium and sew on the skin on the ipsilateral side with the 1-0 surgical sutures (Figure 2E). Separate the right coronary artery trunk from the surrounding tissues (Figure 2E).",
    "Bypass the blocking band under the proximal end of the isolated right coronary artery near the aorta with a wire hook and treat the myocardium with three cycles of 2 min ischemia and 5 min reperfusion by tightening and relaxing the blocking band (Figure 2F). Monitor the heart's electrical activity with the electrocardiogram monitor during the ischemia/reperfusion preconditioning (Figure 2G).\n\tNOTE: When the right coronary artery is blocked, the electrocardiogram shows an increased heart rate and ST-segment elevation.\nTighten the band to block the right coronary blood flow. Cut the epicardium covering the blood vessels. Expose the coronary artery wall, and cut longitudinally with the tip of a surgical blade against the center of the anterior wall of the blood vessels.\nAfter cutting the lumen, enlarge the incision with scissors and place a coronary shunt. Insert one end of the shunt with a coil into the distal coronary artery through the tear. Shunt the blood in the coronary arteries into the hollow coronary shunt to ensure a clear operative field (Figure 2H).\nPerform an end-to-side continuous suture between the internal mammary vein and the right coronary trunk with the 7-0 polypropylene suture (Figure 2I). In the middle of the ascending aorta, occlude the left anterolateral wall of the ascending aorta with a semi-occlusion clamp.\nUse a surgical blade to make a small incision in the aortic wall where the adventitia has been cut, insert the head end of the sliding shaft at the head end of the punch into the aortic cavity through this incision, contract the sliding shaft outward, and the circular knife above it cuts off a piece of the arterial wall. The tissue block cut out by the punch is about 3 mm in diameter (Figure 2J).",
    "Pull out the shunt. Perform an end-to-side continuous suture between the internal mammary vein and the the aortic wall with the 6-0 polypropylene suture (Figure 2K). Open the semi-occlusion clamp.\nRecord the bypass flow of the right coronary artery trunk proximal to the anastomosis site using ultrasound. Monitor the heart's electrical activity using the electrocardiogram (Figure 2L).\nIndwell a temporary drainage tube (Fr: 16) into the chest cavity to allow the blood and fluids to drain. Sew the pericardium incision using a 1-0 cotton thread and close the chest layer by layer (from the inside to the outside: Pleura layer, muscle layer, subcutaneous tissue layer, skin layer) while placing penicillin (about 0.5 g) powder onto each layer. Remove the drainage tube after sewing the skin incision using a 1-0 cotton thread.\n4. Post-surgery care\nRemove the endotracheal tube after the animals returned to spontaneous breathing. The anesthesiologist should assess the animal’s vitals (e.g., respiratory rate, heart rate, oxygen saturation, etc.) and remove the ECG after the animals wake up and return to spontaneous activity. Send the animals back to the feeding room and place the sham animals in another pen in the breeding room. Keep the animals warm with an electric blanket. Observe the animals every hour after surgery (at least 4 times).\nFeed the animal the day after surgery. Add aspirin (200 mg) 2x daily for 7 days to the animal feed to prevent post-operative thrombosis and reduce wound pain.\n\tNOTE: Avoid feeding animals on the day of surgery to prevent aspiration. \nAdminister the animal with an intramuscular injection of penicillin 1x daily for 7 consecutive days to prevent post-operative infection (14,000 units per kg).\n5. Ultrasonic examination",
    "After CABG surgery, use a sterile ultrasonic probe sleeve to wrap the high-frequency linear array probe. Place the probe on the surface of the venous graft.\nDisplay the outline of the graft in the two-dimensional ultrasound mode, then shift to the color Doppler mode to detect blood flow in the graft.\n6. Venous graft tissue collection\nCollect 10 mL of blood sample from the venous circuit of the ear vein for biochemical testing. (Table 1). Centrifuge the blood sample at 1,000 x g for 5 min and perform biochemical tests with an automatic biochemical analyzer.\nAnesthetize the animal as described earlier. Upon confirmation of anesthesia depth, inject 10% potassium chloride 0.5mL/kg body weight from the ear marginal vein or forelimb vein. Then, make a 10 cm median sternal incision with an electric knife to harvest the vein graft 30 days after surgery. Fix the body position as in step 2.2., and after sterilization and placement of a drape, make a median sternum incision to split the sternum. During the separation, avoid the main blood vessels and the heart, and separate the grafted blood vessels layer by layer.\nQuickly cut off the large blood vessels connecting to the heart, place the heart and ascending aorta on ice chips, and remove the graft vascular bridge, the connected aorta, and the right coronary artery. Rinse all the samples with normal saline at 4 °C.\nTake the entire graft vessel of about 3-4 cm in size, divide it into 4-5 equal parts, and transfer to cryopreservation tubes. Quickly put the tubes into liquid nitrogen to flash freeze and move to a −80 °C ultra-low temperature freezer for storage.",
    "For analysis, rinse the graft with ice-cold 0.9% saline and fix it in 4% paraformaldehyde solution. Maintain a ratio of tissue block size to fixative solution of 1:10 and fix the tissue for more than 12 h.\nStain the sections in 50 mL of aqueous solution of hematoxylin for 3 min. Separate the sections by washing with 50 mL of 0.5% hydrochloric acid ethanol and 50 mL of 0.2% ammonia water for 10 s each.\nRinse with running water for 1 h and then clean in distilled water by soaking for 3 min. Dehydrate in 70% and 90% ethanol for 10 min each. Place in 50 mL of 0.5% alcohol eosin staining solution for 2-3 min.\nDehydrate the stained sections with pure ethanol for 10 min and then soak in pure xylene for 10 min to make the samples transparent. Drip the transparent sections with neutral glue and cover with a coverslip. Observe pathological sections under a light microscope at 40x magnification.\nSubscription Required.
