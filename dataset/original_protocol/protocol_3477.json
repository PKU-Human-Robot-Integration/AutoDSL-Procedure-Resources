TPEN, an exceptionally strong Zn2+ chelator, serves as a positive control for Zn2+ competition.\nPrepare frozen mouse pancreas sections.\nLabel plastic blocks and fill with OCT at 20°C–24°C.\nNote: Avoid introducing air bubbles.\nHave dry ice ready in an insulated container.\nDissect out mouse pancreas.\nPerform euthanasia by anesthetizing a mouse with isoflurane overdose, then cervical dislocation.\nNote: Humanely sacrifice mice under appropriate conditions to minimize pain and distress.\nOpen the body cavity and cut the pancreas away from the spleen and duodenum.\nCritical: Take special care to include the islet rich pancreatic tail in the dissection.\nPlace pancreas in OCT.\nUse forceps to shape the pancreas into a dense ball.\nPlace pancreas in middle of OCT and press the pancreas toward the center of the OCT so it is fully submerged.\nPlace mold on dry ice.\nCritical: Do not fix the tissue at any stage, as TSQ/Zn2+ staining will be removed.\nPause Point: Transfer to −80°C for storage or continue to tissue sectioning.\nNote: Sections can be stored at −80°C for at least 12 months without loss in quality.\nCut frozen sections.\nHave clear slides at 20°C–24°C next to a cryostat for section mounting and dry ice available for storing completed slides.\nNote: Use a fresh blade for the best results.\nSet cryostat blade to cut 10 μm sections, mount frozen block in cryostat, and cut into the block until the pancreas is included on sections.\nPlace intact pancreatic sections on (+)-charged slides. Place as many as two sections/slide.",
    "Store sections on dry ice while cutting, or place directly at −80°C.\nPrepare at least 8 sections for testing individual compounds, and at least 2 sections for control treatments.\nPause Point: Either transfer to −80°C for storage or continue to staining.\nConduct competition assays with experimental compounds and TSQ (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/365-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Assessment of islet Zn2+ chelation by fluorescence microscopy\n(A) Experimental workflow consists of treatment of pancreatic frozen sections with TSQ, followed by treatment with a competing chelator, and fluorescent imaging.\n(B) Representative imaging results of TSQ-treated sections, without and with TPEN as a competing chelator. Islets are highlighted (yellow).\n(C) Representative result of islet section treated without and with TPEN, with constant TSQ (10 μM). Relative fluorescence is defined as the normalized ratio of islet TSQ fluorescence to exocrine TSQ fluorescence, where sections treated with TSQ alone are 100% and sections treated with TSQ and TPEN are 0%. Data are represented as means ± SD.\nPrepare staining solutions.\nPrepare phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (37 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4).\nPrepare DCS-1 solution by diluting Nuclear Green (DCS-1) in PBS at 1 μM final concentration.\nPrepare TSQ staining solution by diluting TSQ to 10 μM in DCS-1 staining solution. Make at least 500 μL per compound to be tested.\nUse DCS-1 solution to make compound dilutions for experimental testing. For compounds without known chelating activity, start by testing a single concentration (500 μM or 1 mM). Test experimental compounds at a range of concentrations from 500 μM to 1 μM.\nNote: Approximately 50 μL of diluted compound is needed per experimental concentration.\nAs a positive control, dilute TPEN to 500 μM in DCS-1 solution. In parallel, make a vehicle control by making a 5% solution of DMSO in DSC-1 solution.",
    "Stain tissue sections.\nBring section to 20°C–24°C, wash by dipping the section in PBS, and carefully dry off extra liquid using a lint-free wipe.\nDemarcate pancreas using a hydrophobic marker in a small circle.\nAdd the TSQ-containing staining solution (50 μL) to the section and incubate 5 min, covered with aluminum foil.\nRemove solution with a pipette without disturbing tissue.\nPipette the experimental or control compound solution (50 μL) onto the TSQ-stained section and incubate 5 min, covered with aluminum foil.\nRemove solution and replace with 100 μL PBS per tissue sample.\nDetermine islet TSQ fluorescence (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nPlace slides on a fluorescent microscope at 10–20× magnification.\nFind islets by locating areas with sparse nuclei as seen in the green channel (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nNote: Green fluorescence displays DCS-1 staining of nuclei and allows islets to be located, whereas blue fluorescence reflects the presence of Zn2+-TSQ complex.\nObtain microscope images to capture green (Excitation 503 nm, Emission 526 nm) and blue fluorescence (Excitation 370 nm, Emission 495 nm).\nNote: TPEN-treated sections should have similar TSQ fluorescence in islet and non-islet tissues; alternatively, DMSO-treated sections should exhibit robust islet TSQ fluorescence relative to non-islet pancreatic tissue.\nCapture at least 3 images at 20× magnification of different islets on every section.\nRepeat the above staining protocol for every experimental compound concentration.\nCritical: The time duration from initiating section TSQ staining until image capture should not exceed 10 min.\nPause Point: Additional compound dilutions may be evaluated on freshly thawed sections as convenient.\nQuantify and plot islet fluorescence (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nUse Photoshop (Adobe) or equivalent software to analyze blue/green fluorescent images.\nIdentify islets in the green channel and demarcate the areas of interest using the elliptical marquee tool.",
    "Record the median fluorescent intensity of the identified region(s) in the blue channel. This value reflects islet fluorescence.\nMove the marquee tool, without changing its size or shape, to a non-islet area and record blue median fluorescence.\nRepeat for all islets in all images.\nCalculate the ratio of islet to exocrine median fluorescence in the blue (TSQ) channel for all islets imaged.\nNormalize islet/exocrine fluorescence ratio to 0% (TPEN-treated) and 100% (DMSO-treated) following the below formula: imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/365-Si1.jpg\nPlot the normalized fluorescence according to experimental compound treatment concentration.\nUsing Prism (GraphPad) or equivalent software, fit the dilution data to a 4-parameter inhibition curve to obtain the 4 parameter values of Top, Bottom, IC50, and nH.\nNote: IC50 and nH indicate strength of chelator’s affinity for Zn2+ in an islet context.\nAssess islet accumulation of compounds by LC-MS/MS\nTiming: 3 days\nThis step measures zinc-dependent accumulation of Zn2+-binding compounds in islets (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/365-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.
