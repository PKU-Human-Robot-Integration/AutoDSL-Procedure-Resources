    "**Create input geometry and carry out a molecular mechanics conformational search in Spartan ● TIMING 30 min \\(Steps 1 – 8)** \n**1 |** _Draw cis-3-methylcyclohexanol in the Spartan workspace._ In Spartan select _File_ → _New_ to open the _Model Kit_ toolbar. Change the _Rings_ drop down menu to _Cyclohexane_ and click inside the workspace to add a parent cyclohexane molecule. Select the _Csp3_ button within the _Model Kit_ toolbar and click one of the yellow open valences on the cyclohexane ring. This operation will attach the methyl group. Select the _Osp3_ button within the _Model Kit_ toolbar and click a yellow open valence on the cyclohexane ring that is both two carbons separated from and _cis_ to the previously added methyl group. This will add an oxygen atom to the cyclohexane ring to give _cis_-3-methylcyclohexanol. Ensure that the overall structure is _cis_-3-methylcyclohexanol before continuing.\n**2 |**  _Quick and Crude Molecular Mechanics Geometry Optimization._ Cleanup the preliminary geometry by clicking the _Minimize_ button or selecting _Build_ → _Minimize_.\n**3 |** _Perform the conformational search._ Select _Setup_ → _Calculations._ A window will open. Change the _Calculate:_ drop down menu selection to _Conformer Distribution_. Change the two drop down menus to the right so that they display _Molecular Mechanics_ and _MMFF_. Check the box next to _Maximum:_ and change the conformers examined to “1000”. Click _Submit_ and a _Save As_ window will appear. Change the computational filename to “cis-3-methylcyclohexanol”, change the directory \\(i.e. folder) to a location that is convenient for storing the associated computational files, and click _Save_. Click _OK_ in the window that appears, which indicates that the conformational search has started.",
    "**4 |** After the conformational search has finished, a window confirming that the job has completed will appear. Click _OK_ in this window. When prompted to open a new document select _No_. Select _File_ → _Close_ to clear the workspace.\n**5 |** Select _File_ → _Open_ and locate the conformational search output file “cis-3-methylcyclohexanol.spartan.” \n**6 |** _Ensure that all expected conformers have been found by the calculation._ Select _Display_ → _Spreadsheet_ to open a window containing an entry for each structure found during the conformational search. A conformational search of _cis_-3-methylcyclohexanol is expected to yield six unique conformers.\n**7 |** _Export the library of conformers as a single “.sdf” file._ Select _File_ → _Save As…_ to open a _Save As_ window. Enter “cis-3-methylcyclohexanol” as the filename, change the _Save as type:_ drop down menu selection to _MDL SD \\(*.sdf)_ and click _Save_. If a popup window appears with the title _Select molecules_, click _Write all molecules_ followed by _OK_. Click _OK_ in the popup window that confirms the file export. This step will export all structures from the conformational search to a single “.sdf” file—“cis-3-methylcyclohexanol.sdf”—located in the same directory as the conformational search output file.\n**8 |** _Examine the resulting “.sdf” file to ensure that the results of the conformational search were correctly exported \\(Optional)._ Open the “.sdf” file in a text-editing application \\(e.g., TextEdit in Mac OS X or Notepad in Windows) and check that an entry is included for all unique conformations. A unique entry typically begins with the text “Spartan” followed by a series of numbers. Additionally, structures are usually systematically labeled, for example, the first conformation is by default titled “M0001”.\n**Create Gaussian input files for each conformer ● TIMING 15 min \\(Steps 9 – 12)**",
    "**9 |** Download the “write-g09-inputs-sdf.py” \\(or “write-g03-inputs-sdf.py” if using Gaussian 03) Python script from \"**Supplementary Data 1**\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/3133/original/Supplementary_Data_1.zip?1398228281 to the directory containing the “.sdf” file created in Step 7 \\(see Step 3 for directory location). If using Python version 2, download the “write-g09-inputs-sdf.py” script located in the Python-Version-2 directory within \"**Supplementary Data 1**\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/3133/original/Supplementary_Data_1.zip?1398228281. \n**▲ CRITICAL STEP** Users must download the Python script from \"**Supplementary Data 1**\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/3133/original/Supplementary_Data_1.zip?1398228281 that is compatible with the particular versions of both Python \\(i.e., either version 2 or 3) and Gaussian \\(i.e., either version 09 or 03) that are to be used.\n**10 |**  _Editing the “write-g09-inputs-sdf.py” Python script to change the memory and number of processors used in Gaussian calculations \\(optional)._ To accommodate different users’ needs, we have prepared the “write-g09-inputs-sdf.py” Python script so that it is convenient to change the amount of memory and the number of the processors allocated to the computationally intensive Gaussian 09 jobs. Open the “write-g09-inputs-sdf.py” Python script in IDLE or any other Python script editor. Adjust the amount of memory used in the Gaussian 09 optimization/frequency and NMR jobs by changing the number to the right of “%mem=” on line 86 and 113, respectively. Adjust the number of core processors used in the Gaussian 09 optimization/frequency and NMR jobs by changing the number to the right of “%nproc=” on line 87 and 114, respectively. Save the edited script file in the same directory as the “.sdf” file created in Step 9.\n**11 |**  In a command line interface application \\(i.e. Terminal for Mac OS X or Linux or Command Prompt for Windows) navigate to the directory that contains the “.sdf” file, the “write-g09-inputs-sdf.py” Python script and the associated computational files.",
    "**12 |**  Execute the “write-g09-inputs-sdf.py” Python script \\(or the edited script that may have been created in Step 10 by entering the following command:\n_> python write-g09-inputs-sdf.py cis-3-methylcyclohexanol.sdf_\nThe script will request the name of the candidate structure by displaying the following prompt:\n     _Enter the name of the candidate structure:_\nEnter “cis-3-methylcyclohexanol” as the candidate structure name. Avoid using spaces when entering the name of the candidate structure. If the script executes successfully, the following message will be displayed:\n_The script successfully performed the task of creating_\n_Gaussian input files for each unique structure within the_ \n_cis-3-methylcyclohexanol.sdf file and moved these input files to the_ \n_cis-3-methylcyclohexanol-gaussian_files directory._\nFor each unique conformation within the associated “.sdf” file, the script will create two Gaussian input files. The script also creates a new directory labeled “cis-3-methylcyclohexanol-gaussian_files” and moves all of the Gaussian input files into this newly created directory. The Gaussian input files labeled “cis-3-methylcyclohexanol-opt_freq-conf-#.com” are the input files for geometry optimization and frequency calculation. The Gaussian input files labeled “cis-3-methylcyclohexanol-nmr-conf-#.com” are the input files for NMR shielding tensor calculations. \n**? TROUBLESHOOTING**       \n**Perform DFT calculations in Gaussian 09 \\(cf. Procedure in ref. 7) ● TIMING 1 h \\(Step 13)**",
    "**13 |**  To obtain the computed NMR data for the candidate structure, consult the Procedure in ref. 7 for instructions on using the resulting input files from Step 12 within Gaussian 09 to calculate \\(i) DFT-optimized conformer geometries, \\(ii) free energies using the “opt_freq-conf” input files, and \\(iii) NMR shielding tensors using the “nmr-conf” input files. Additionally, the Procedure in ref. 7 includes Python scripts and detailed instructions for \\(i) assembling the free energy and NMR shielding tensor data into well-organized spreadsheet files, \\(ii) referencing and scaling the NMR data, \\(iii) determining the Boltzmann weighting factors of all conformers, and \\(iv) applying these weighting factors to generate the set of Boltzmann-weighted chemical shifts for the candidate structure. Details with regard to the choice of computational methodology \\(e.g., DFT functional and basis set preferences) are discussed in ref. 7. Additionally, the previously reported protocol<sup>7</sup> highlights methods for determining the “best fit” for a candidate structure when comparing experimental spectral data to the computed NMR chemical shifts. Alternative approaches to determining the “best fit” have recently been reported by Goodman<sup>10,11</sup> and Sarotti<sup>12,13</sup>, and more traditional approaches are described in several excellent reviews<sup>14,15</sup>."
