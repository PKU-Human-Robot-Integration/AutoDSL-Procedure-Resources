    "Cells are grown in DMEMcplt in the incubator in a 5% CO2 environment at 37 °C, in presence of 0.5 mg/ml geneticin in case of replicon cell lines and 10 µg/ml blasticidin for CANXHA overexpressing cells. Around 5-7.5 x 107 cells are needed for the experiment, which equals six 15 cm cell culture dishes. Note: Cell confluence should not exceed 90% at the day of harvest. Cells are washed twice in PBS and subsequently scraped in 5 ml PBS per dish and transferred into a 50 ml falcon tube.The cells are pelleted at 700 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.The supernatant is removed and cells are resuspended in 2 ml hypotonic buffer containing 1x protease inhibitor cocktail.Cells are incubated on ice for 30 min.Cells are broken by 40 strokes with the dounce homogenizer. Note: Turn pestle on the bottom of mortar chamber by 90° during each stroke.Cell debris and nuclei are pelleted by centrifugation at 700 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Preparation of discontinuous sucrose gradient in ultra-centrifugation SW40 tubes:Pipette 4 ml 70% sucrose on the bottom and consecutively overlay carefully with 3 ml 60% sucrose, 2 ml 40% sucrose and 2 ml 30% sucrose.2 ml post-nuclear supernatants (see step 7) are carefully layered on top of the sucrose gradient.Membrane fractions are separated in the sucrose gradient by ultra-centrifugation for 4 h at 130,000 x g using a SW40 rotor.Place tubes in the clamp of a lab stand, and carefully make a hole at the bottom using a 19 G needle. Collect 13 1 ml fractions, with fraction number 1 being the lowest one and number 13 representing the top of the gradient.",
    "Note: The elution speed of the gradient should be around 1 drop per second, which can be adjusted by the hole size on the bottom.Gradient fractions can be analyzed for their protein and HCV RNA content. Typically the majority of HCV RNA and proteins are found in fractions 7-11 (Paul et al., 2013), which thus are subsequently pooled.Equilibrate pooled fractions 7-11 to 150 mM NaCl by adding an appropriate volume of 5 M NaCl solution (e.g. 150 µl 5 M NaCl for 5 ml fractions 7-11), and store a small aliquot (~50 µl as input samples).Determine protein concentration in pooled fractions by using the Bradford assay and a BSA standard curve.Wash 25 µl anti-HA agarose beads with 500 µl IP washing buffer I in 2 ml Eppendorf tubes (for each NS4Bwt, NS4BHA and CANXHA). Pellet beads by centrifugation at 3,800 x g for 3 min at 4 °C and remove supernatant.Incubate beads with membrane fraction containing a total of around 1 mg protein (approximately 1-1.5 ml) for 4 h on a rotator wheel at 4 °C. Note: The total protein input should be the same for the three IP samples.Pellet beads and bound material by centrifugation at 3,800 x g for 3 min at 4 °C and remove supernatant.Wash beads three times with 1 ml IP washing buffer I and in between each washing step pellet beads as described in step 17. Add 1ml of IP washing buffer I and transfer beads and bound material into a new eppendorf tube and pellet beads as described in step 17.Wash beads with 1 ml IP washing buffer II and pellet beads as described in step 17.Elution of bound material:Add 100 µl IP elution buffer to the beads and shake the samples for 15 min at 1,100 rpm at 25 °C.",
    "Pellet beads by centrifugation at 3,800 x g for 3 min at 25 °C.Collect and keep supernatant.Add 100 µl IP elution buffer to the beads and shake the samples for 15 min at 1,100 rpm at 25 °C.Pellet beads by centrifugation at 3,800 x g for 3 min at 25 °C.Collect and pool with supernatant from step 21c.IP elution fractions can be analyzed in a variety of subsequent assays, including western blot, RNA quantification as well as electron microscopy analyses (Paul et al., 2013)."
