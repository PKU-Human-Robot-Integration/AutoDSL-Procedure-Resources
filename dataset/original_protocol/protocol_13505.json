    "1. Sample collection\nSample odors that are one of the following:\n\t\nCollect spontaneously released by habituated study subjects (e.g., zoo primates) via scent-marking on sterile filter paper (e.g., scent-gland odor secretions) or directly into vials (e.g., urine).\nCollect by rubbing sterile cotton swabs after training study subjects by using positive reinforcement training.\nCollect by rubbing sterile cotton swabs after sedation of study subjects.\nPlace samples into sterile 10 mL screw-capped clear glass vials, and seal with screw topped caps incorporating FTFE/silicone septa. Immediately store them at -20 °C.\n\tNOTE: It is vital to use clean personal protective equipment, such as nitrile gloves; change them frequently; avoid direct skin contact with samples and vials. It is preferred to use brand-new vials; however, in case of used vials, it is vital to pre-clean the vials, and then use the same protocol.\nTake environmental blanks every time scent-marks are collected. For example, collect the sampling media (e.g., filter paper or swab) and a headspace vial that are exposed to the environment while sampling is undertaken.\n2. Sample preparation\nPrepare samples in the field by cutting with a blade an approximate 10 mm square from a scent-marked filter paper, or the head of the swab, and placing it in a 10 mL screw-topped head-space vial.\nAfter each sample has been prepared, dispose or clean the blade used to cut the sampling media using an appropriate antibacterial wipe and/or alcohol and dry thoroughly.\nStore all samples at -20 °C.\n\tNOTE: Preferred at -20 °C or otherwise as low as practically possible in the field.\n3. Preparation for analysis\nRemove samples from the freezer and allow to warm naturally to room temperature for at least 1 h.\nSet up the analytical method on the GC-MS as follows:",
    "For SPME analysis conditions, follow the manufacturer's directions to condition SPME fibers before first use: fiber pre-condition (260 °C for 5 min), sample incubation (40 °C for 2 min), extraction time (15 min), desorption time (2 min), and fiber post-condition (260 °C for 20 min).\nUse the following GC conditions: column (HP5-MS 30 m x 0.25 mm; 0.25 µm), injector temperature (270 °C), flow rate (1 mL/min), injection mode (splitless), GC oven profile (45 °C for 2 min; 4 °C/min to 170 °C; 20 °C/min to 300 °C), MSD transfer line (280 °C).\n\t\tNOTE: To improve between sample retention time consistency the analytical method is retention time locked).\nUse the following MSD conditions: solvent delay (2.5 min) and scan range (29 to 400 amu).\n\t\tNOTE: A range of 10 to 400 was used in previous protocols4.\nEnsure that the purge gas supply to the fiber conditioning unit is turned on.\n\t​NOTE: It is vital that the SPME assembly is correctly installed in the auto-sampler and that it is aligned to the auto-sampler trays, fiber conditioning unit and GC inlet port. Incorrect alignment could result in damage or destruction of the SPME fiber.\n4. Analysis\nPlace an empty headspace vial (to act as a system blank) in the first position of the GC-MS auto-sampler tray. Place the environmental blank in the second position of the auto-sampler tray. Place the samples for analysis in the subsequent positions of the auto-sample tray.\nCreate an analytical sequence to analyze each sample within the sample tray.\n\t\nIn the MassHunter home screen, select Sequence | Load sequence.\nComplete the sequence table for all blanks and samples by inserting the appropriate information. Save the completed sequence table.",
    "NOTE: The exact information for the sequence table will be dependent on the laboratories formatting for the table. Minimum information would normally include sample type, sample name, vial location and number, analytical method and data file location and name (allocation of a data file name that matches the sample name aids future data processing). Additional samples can be added to the sequence during the analysis.\nRun the sequence by selecting Sequence | Run sequence.\nAfter analysis return samples to the freezer as soon as possible.\n\t​NOTE: it may be possible to reanalyze samples, but it should be noted that some volatile components may have been totally extracted during the initial analysis and some compounds may have undergone thermal and bacterial decomposition at 40 °C, thus the resulting chromatogram may not be thoroughly representative of the original scent-marking.\n5. Data analysis\nNOTE: Initial data analysis includes the integration of chromatograms to obtain retention time and peak area data together with tentative identification of peaks using ChemStation software and NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) mass spectral databases, version MSD F.01.01.2317. Data analysis can be carried out either manually or through a semi-automated method. If the semi-automated method is used then it is sometimes beneficial to undertake a degree of manual data analysis to verify tentative identifications.\nOpen the data file by clicking on the appropriate file in the left-hand navigation bar. The total ion chromatogram (TIC) will be displayed in the top window of the data analysis screen.\nTo integrate the TIC using the RTE integrator, select Chromatogram | Integrate.",
    "Adjust integration parameters so that peaks that are greater than 3 x baseline noise are integrated. Select Chromatogram | MS Signal Integration Parameters. In the output box adjust the minimum peak area as appropriate (1.0 produces acceptable results in our examples).\nTo identify peaks and generate a summary report, select Export Reports | Library search results report to XLS.\n\tNOTE: The spectral libraries to be searched together with the number of library matches to be displayed need to be preset within the software before a library search can be undertaken.\nThe resulting spreadsheet report contains integration data for each peak and a tentative spectral library match to assign identity. Typically, the library quality/library match should be >80 to accept the tentative identification. Save the spreadsheet.\nIdentify a peak directly from the TIC.\n\t\nChoose the peak of interest.\nIf the peak is small, zoom in by drawing a box around the peak by holding the left hand mouse button down, stretch the box over the peak and release.\nPlace the cursor line so that it is at the highest point of the peak (or just after).\nDouble click the right hand mouse button and the mass spectrum for the peak will appear in the lower window of the data analysis screen.\nTo search the spectral library, move the cursor anywhere in the spectral window and double click the right hand mouse button. The library search results will appear in a new window.",
    "To remove the background noise from a spectrum of interest, first double click the right hand mouse button on the peak in question. Then double click the right hand mouse button in an area with no peaks immediately in front of the peak of interest. Select Chromatogram | Subtract spectra. The subtracted spectrum will display in the lower window of the data analysis screen and will display '(-)' next to the SCAN data in the window header.\nSubscription Required.
