  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: This animal protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at The Ohio State University. This procedure can be used on any mouse in which the inner diameter of the carotid artery is large enough to insert the catheter. Use mice that are above 16 g (older than ~2 months).\n1. Preparing Mouse for Catheterization\nSeal all surgical instruments and supplies in a sterilization pouch. Sterilize the pouch in an autoclave machine. Maintain a sterile field throughout the procedure and wear sterile gloves.\nAnesthetize mice with ketamine (55 mg/kg) plus xylazine (15 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection.\n\tNOTE: The whole procedure measuring both pressure/volume at various heart rates and ESPRV takes less than 20 min. If additional time is required (i.e., more than 30 min), give an additional ¼ dose of anesthesia every 30 min.\nRemove the hair in the anterior region of neck and chest area using hair removing lotion (e.g., Nair) and tape the limbs of the mouse onto the foam platform. Confirm a state of deep anesthesia by a toe pinch.\nInsert a rectal probe to monitor the body temperature (37 ± 1 °C), and maintain using a thermo-regulated heating pad (located between the surgical drape and platform).\nPrepare a length of 4-0 suture (~10 cm). Loop suture around the upper incisors and tape to platform. This will keep the neck straight.\nSterilize the surgical area by swabbing the area with Betadine and 75% alcohol three times.\n2. Catheterization\nPrepare the catheter by presoaking the tip in saline or distilled water (37 °C) for at least 30 min prior to use (according to manufacturer’s instructions) to acclimate the pressure sensor diaphragm for the wet biological environment and to prevent pressure signal drift and negative pressure recordings.",
    "Make a longitudinal 0.8 cm incision between the lower jaw and sternum in the anterior region of the neck. With the fine scissors, separate the skin-muscular connective tissue to expose the trachea located under the stemohyoideus muscle.\nSeparate the fat and muscular tissue at the right side of the trachea with curved forceps to expose the right carotid artery.\n\tNOTE: The carotid artery is the biggest artery in the anterior region of the neck, contains bright red blood, and is pulsatile. Do not confuse with the jugular vein that runs parallel to the carotid artery. The jugular vein is dark red and non-pulsatile. In addition, during the isolation of the carotid artery, the user should be aware of not damaging the pneumogastric nerve.\nRemove the fat from the right carotid artery with the curved forceps. If there exists branching of the vessel which will impede this operational technique, cut them with a Bovie cautery to dissociate the carotid artery. Separate as much of the tissue as possible under the carotid artery using curved forceps.\nCut two 5 cm 6-0 silk threads. Pass each silk thread under the right carotid artery.\nPosition one thread near the proximal part and the other near the distal part of the artery. Make a tight knot on the thread at the distal part, and make a loose knot on the thread at the proximal part.\nBlock blood flow by clamping the proximal part of the artery using a small hemostat vascular clamp (place the clamp below the proximal thread). The sealed region of the artery will be filled with blood making it easy to perform step 2.8.",
    "Puncture a small hole in the right carotid artery between the two threads (but closer to the distal thread) with a 26 G needle. Insert the catheter into the carotid artery. Slightly tighten the loose knot at the proximal part of the carotid artery onto the catheter to keep in place.\n\tNOTE: Using the needle puncture is preferred compared to scissors incision. By making a tight knot in the distal part of the artery first, and then clamping the proximal part, the artery will be fully filled with blood. This makes it very easy to poke through the blood vessel. Furthermore, the size of the needle (26 G) punctures the artery with a hole that nicely fits the size of the catheter. When using the scissors incision method, it was more difficult to control the size of the incision. However, the method chosen should be dependent upon on which one the surgeon feels more comfortable with.\nStart recording pressure signals as in step 3.\nLoosen the hemostat clamp and continue inserting the catheter forward into the left ventricle. If some resistance is experienced when advancing the catheter, gently pull it back and try advancing again. For a mouse weighing ~18-25 g, the estimated length of the catheter that is inserted is 18 mm.\n\tNOTE: The arterial pressure signal will fluctuate from 70 to 120 mm Hg. Once the catheter is in the left ventricle the shape of the pressure signal changes and the pressure will fluctuate from 0 to 120 mm Hg (shown in Figure 1). Heart function will stabilize within 2-3 min after insertion of the catheter.\nContinuously monitor body temperature, anesthesia level, and breathing rate.\n3. Data Acquisition",
    "Use LabChartPro 7 software (or similar software). Use the WorkFlow option of the PV Loop LabChart Module. Using this module, select the Pressure and Volume Loops default setting.\nSet-up three channels: one channel for pressure, one channel for volume, and one channel for heart rate. Set scale ranges of above parameters as 0-150 mm Hg, 0-100 µl and 0-800 beat/min, respectively.\nPress start key to record.\n4. Bowditch Effect\nMake a 1 cm incision in the precordium area parallel to the manubrium. Cut the layer of muscle and expose the intercostal space using scissors.\nUsing a square pulse stimulator, set the following parameters: Voltage of 2 V, duration of 2 msec, and enable repeat mode.\nHold the negative electrode with forceps and insert it through the fourth intercostal space to the apical region of the heart. Hold the positive electrode with forceps and insert it through the second intercostal space to the right atrium region of the heart.\nTurn on the stimulator and change the frequency to pace the heart from 4 Hz (240 beats/min) up to 10 Hz (600 beats/min). At each new heart rate, stimulate the heart for 1 min before data collection.\n5. Generating the ESPVR and PRSW\nCut the skin and muscle tissue perpendicular to the manubrium in the abdominal area with scissors. Open the enterocoelia and expose the liver.\nDrag the arcus costarum towards the head using metallic traction.\nGently push the liver downwards with a cotton swab. Be careful not to push too much to affect the chest cavity. This will change heart function.\nCut the falciform ligament of the liver with scissors to expose the suprahepatic inferior vena cava (IVC).",
    "Use curved forceps to rapidly squeeze the IVC for 5 sec to block the return of blood to the right atrium. The left ventricular pressure and volume will fall due to the reduced inflow to the heart. In generating these values, do not use loops below 60 mm Hg. The 60 mm Hg is in reference to systolic pressure.\n\tNOTE: This value is set at 60 mm Hg because this will cause a significant drop in perfusion pressure to considerably decrease coronary perfusion and affect contractility.\n6. Volume Calibration\nHeparinize the mouse with 0.1 ml of 1:5,000 heparin solution (diluted with normal saline) by intraperitoneal injection.\nRemove the catheter from the carotid artery. When the catheter is pulled out from the carotid artery, heparinized blood will seep from the hole where the catheter was inserted.\nCollect this blood for volume calibration using a 1 ml syringe. Fill each well in calibration cuvette.\nRemove heart to euthanize the mouse via exsanguination.\nPosition the catheter in each well and get a steady relative volume unit (RVU) value. Generate a standard curve using the various standard volumes and RVU values from each well.\nConvert the recorded RVU to µl.\n7. Data Processing\nTo examine the Bowditch effect, select steady-state pressure/volume traces from each heart rate. Click the baseline analysis to obtain data.\nFor ESPVR and PRSW data, select the first ~15 pressure/volume traces, click occlusion analysis in the software to generate the ESPVR (slope of the pressure developed by the LV at end-diastolic volume) and PRSW (the linear regression of stroke work with the end-diastolic volume ) slopes.",
    "Give attention to the shape of the loops. Make sure the loop is closed with no angular points or twists. This is a sign of improper catheter placement or excess noise. Periodically check loops during the experiment to ensure proper pressure and volume data are being generated.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
