    "Human tissues used in this protocol are fresh adult gingival tissues discarded from extractions of impacted teeth in the Maxillofacial Surgery Department according to the guidelines of the Institution's Human Research Ethics Committee (Protocol No. GR201711, Date: 02-27-2017).\n1. Preparations\nCollect fresh adult gingival tissues in 15 mL tubes containing 10 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 3% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) and keep the tissues at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: Treat the tissues as detailed below within 24 h after excision.\n2. Prepare reagents and culture medium\nPrepare the washing solution: 3% P/S. Mix 50 mL of PBS with 1.5 mL of penicillin (100 U/mL) and 1.5 mL of streptomycin (100 mg/L).\nPrepare 500 mL of growth-factor-containing medium (called G-medium): DMEM/F12 (3:1) medium containing 1% P/S, 2% B27 supplement, 20 ng/mL of epidermal growth factor (EGF), 40 ng/mL of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), and 40 µg/mL of fungizone.\nPrepare enzyme digestion solutions for the new method: Dissolve 125 mg of Dispase powder and 125 mg of Type I collagenase powder in 50 mL of DMEM.\n\tNOTE: Filter all the enzyme solutions through a 0.22 µm strainer and store at 4 °C.\nPrepare 500 mL of the medium to neutralize the enzymatic digestion: 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% P/S in the DMEM medium.\n3. Direct explant method\nGingival tissue pretreatment\n\t\nWash gingival tissue with 5 mL of 75% ethanol for 30 s. Then, rinse twice with 5 mL of the washing solution (step 2.1) for 5 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Perform all washes in cell culture dishes with a diameter of 50 mm.\nGingival epithelial cell culture\n\t\nCut the gingival tissue into 1 mm3 pieces and scatter them in a 100 mm cell culture dish. Use fine pointed forceps and ophthalmic scissors for the cutting operations.",
    "Add the G-medium (step 2.2) to the culture dish. Then, incubate the culture dish in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Use an inverted microscope (40x) to examine the tissues every 24 h.\nRemove the gingival tissue pieces when the epithelial cells have propagated to a 2-5 mm in diameter around the tissue pieces. Change the G-medium every 2-4 days.\n4. The new modified enzymatic method\nGingival tissue pretreatment\n\t\nFor this, follow the same steps as described for the direct explant method, step 3.1.1.\nDigestion of gingival tissue\n\t\nCut the gingival tissue into tiny pieces, approximately <1 mm in size, with two sterilized blades. Repeat the process of shredding with two surgical blades.\nAdd 1 mL of 2.5 mg/mL dispase + collagenase solution to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube containing the gingival tissue pieces, and then incubate the tube for 15-20 min in an incubator at 37 °C.\nWhen the tissue becomes transparent and flocculent, add 1 mL of the neutralization solution to terminate the digestion. Thoroughly mix the solution by pipetting up and down 10-15 times. Pass the solution through a 100 µm mesh filter.\nCentrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet at the bottom in 10 mL of growth-factor-containing medium (step 2.2). Transfer the cell suspension to a 100 mm cell culture dish. Add 10 µM of Y-27632 to the cell culture dish.\nCulture the cells at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Replace the old G-medium with the fresh G-medium every 2 days. Observe the cells on Day 1 and Day 3.\n5. Cell passaging\nTake the dish out of the incubator, remove the spent medium and wash twice with PBS. Add 2 mL of 0.05% trypsin for each 100 mm dish.",
    "NOTE: Shake the dish to make sure there is enough contact between the Trypsin solution and the dish bottom.\nLeave the dish in an incubator around 5 min at 37 °C for the digestion process.\nUse a microscope (40x) to examine the cells and make sure that most cells have separated from the bottom of the dish.\nAdd 2 mL of the neutralization solution to stop the digestion and transfer the cells into a 15 mL tube. Pipette up and down 10-15 times. Centrifuge the cells at 200 x g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant slowly. Resuspend the cells with 10 mL of G-medium and count the number of cells.\nAdd about 1 x 106 cells in 10 mL of G-medium and 10 µM Y-27632 to each 100 mm dish.\nRenew the G-medium and Y-27632 every 2 days. View the cells on Day 1 and Day 5.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
