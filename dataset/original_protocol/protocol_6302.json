    "General guidelines: Perform all steps in a biosafety cabinet. Pathogenic cryptococci are biosafety level 2 organisms.Proper Köhler illumination and perfect alignment of the polarizers and prisms are crucial for DIC microscopy. Make sure to check these settings prior to performing the experiments.Before doing live-imaging experiments, run tests with a suspension of capsule-induced cells in a 50% (v/v) mixture of Percoll® and Sab-MOPS to ensure that the system is properly set up for capsule imaging.In order to make precise measurements of capsule size, make sure the microscope is properly calibrated with a micrometer scale. If your microscope does not automate scaling, you need to collect an image of a micrometer scale prior to imaging the Cryptococcus cells.The cells are incubated for imaging on a closed chamber. The most common mistake during assembly of the incubation system is to screw on the metal parts too loose, causing the chamber to leak when you try to fill it with the cell suspension, or causing the spacers to bend instead of being pierced by the syringe needle; or too much, causing the glass plates to crack. Practice mounting and filling it with water before you do the experiment the first time.Live-imaging experiments are very challenging and can require several repetitions for success. Here is a list of problems that happen very often and suggestions to minimize them:As the cells are not attached to the coverslip, they frequently move sideways out of the field of view. This problem can be minimized to a certain extent in microscopes with a motorized stage. We usually set experiments up collecting a panel consisting of 3 x 3 fields, with the cell of interest in the center.The cells can also drift on the Z-axis, leading to loss of focus.",
    "We minimize this by collecting Z-stacks with at least 11 slices spaced 1 μm apart, with the best focus being in the middle.Some cells just do not multiply or significantly induce their capsules during the time of the experiment. Again, using a motorized stage, we collect images from several regions in each experiment to increase the chance that in at least some of them we can observe the capsule in a single cell for several hours.Static imaging of the capsuleObtain the Cryptococcus spp. cells for capsule imaging according to your experimental design. We have successfully imaged capsules from cultures grown in solid and liquid media, from both C. neoformans and C. gattii species complex strains.Dilute the cells in PBS and mix in a 1:1 proportion with Percoll®. We have imaged capsules in cell suspensions in a wide range of concentrations, from around 103 to over 106 cells per ml.Add 10 μl of the mixture to a slide and cover with a coverslip.Observe and image the cells on a DIC microscope.Time-lapse imaging of capsule growth–preparing the cellsIn the afternoon, with a sterile toothpick, collect a single Cryptococcus colony from a fresh (younger than two weeks) YPD agar plate and seed it into a culture tube containing 5 ml of YPD broth.Grow the yeast culture overnight in an orbital shaker at 30 °C and 200 rpm.On the same day, sterilize the POCmini-2 Cell Cultivation System components (use the 1-mm spacers) according to manufacturer’s instructions by autoclaving. Also autoclave small tweezers to maintain sterility later while mounting the cultivation chamber.Note: It is easier to close the chamber after sterilization if it is autoclaved already partially assembled, with the gasket screwed in just a little. Do not screw it completely, though, because it will not be effectively sterilized.",
    "In the morning of the next day, before you begin processing the yeast culture, switch on the microscope and set the heating system to 37 °C, to prewarm the whole machine in preparation for the experiment.Note: A microscope such as the Axio Z1 takes at least one hour to reach 37 °C. If you forget this step, this will cause a delay later. The microscope must be at the incubation temperature before the time-lapse microscopy begins because thermal expansion of its parts will change the focal plane otherwise. Collect 2 ml of the culture into a sterile 2 ml polypropylene tube and pellet the cells at 1,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature in a microcentrifuge. Remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet, resuspend the cells into 1 ml of sterile PBS, saline or water, transfer the suspension to a 1.5 ml polypropylene tube and repeat the centrifugation at 1,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Repeat this wash two more times to wash off remaining material from the culture broth.After the last centrifugation, resuspend cells in 500 µl of a 60% dilution of Percoll® in Sab-MOPS.Centrifuge cells at 2,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature.Carefully remove 400 µl of the supernatant without disturbing the pellet. Resuspend the cells in the remaining supernatant by pipetting up and down.Notes:Use a P200 micropipette for this step. Do not try to remove all the supernatant: the tiny pellet that forms at the previous step is quite loose and will be aspirated if you try. Steps B7 to B9 are optional, and we have successfully made experiments without them. They can be skipped altogether, with the washed cells from Step B6 resuspended in PBS and counted as in Step B10.",
    "We do recommend making the centrifugation in Percoll®, though, to enrich the suspension for cells denser than the 50% Percoll®/Sab-MOPS mixture that is used for time-lapse microscopy (see below). In several experiments we found that most cryptococcal cells were less dense than the 50% Percoll® suspension, so they floated off the focal plane of the microscope during incubation. A 60% mixture of Percoll® in medium is slightly denser than the 50% mixture that is used in the actual experiment, which ensures that any cells that are dense enough to pellet in this step will not fail to settle down in the incubation chamber later. The final pellet on 60% Percoll® is usually very small, which is why we start from at least 2 ml of the culture. Collect a 10 µl aliquot of the suspension from Step B9 (or Step B7 if you skip the centrifugation in Percoll®) to estimate cell density in a hemocytometer. In a separate tube, prepare 1 ml of a 50% mixture of Percoll® in Sab-MOPS (include an antibiotic, for example ampicillin at 50 µg/ml) and transfer a volume of the cell suspension from Step B9 (or Step B7 if you skip the centrifugation in Percoll®) equivalent to 1,000-2,000 cells. Mix well by pipetting up and down. Notes:The reason we use so few cells are that a higher cell density in the incubation chamber will cause neighboring cell clusters to coalesce during incubation, rendering documentation of capsule growth impossible. Of all documented capsule-inducing media, we have tested this protocol with three. CO2-independent medium (Ost et al., 2015) produced less capsule growth than the SAB-MOPS medium we describe in this protocol. Minimal medium, however, formed an opaque gel with Percoll® at 37 °C after a few hours.",
    "The addition of ampicillin is not rigorously necessary, but we found it helped avoid bacterial contamination that happened sometimes, probably during manipulation of the incubation chamber.Time-lapse imaging of capsule growth-Collecting imagesMount the POCmini-2 Cell Cultivation System as instructed by the manufacturer. Use a 1-mm spacer and manipulate the glass plates with a sterile tweezer.Note: As explained above, it is a good idea to practice mounting and filling the cultivation chamber with water before you do the experiment the first time. Introduce a sterile 30-gauge needle through one of the orifices, carefully piercing the spacer.Fill a 1-ml insulin syringe fitted with a 30-gauge needle with the cell suspension from Step B10. Make sure to expel all the air in the syringe.Carefully pierce the spacer with the syringe needle through the orifice opposite to the one you put the needle through in Step C2.Slowly inject the cell suspension into the POCmini-2, expelling the air through the needle opposite. When the chamber is nearly full, carefully remove first the opposite needle when the air is fully expelled, then the syringe and needle with the rest of the cell suspension. The POCmini-2 holds about 800 µl with a 1-mm spacer.Put the POCmini-2 in the appropriate sample holder in the microscope and close the incubation chamber.Scan the POCmini-2 visible area manually to pinpoint isolated, single, non-moving cells. Adjust Köhler illumination and the DIC slider for optimal contrast.Note: Because so few cells were introduced into the POCmini-2, it takes time and patience to find them. It can be helpful to roughly find the appropriate focus by switching to a 10x objective, but this should only be done with long working distance 10x objectives to avoid getting them soiled with immersion oil.",
    "Using the microscope firmware (Zen 2 in our case), set up the equipment to collect images every 5-15 min during 24-72 h.Wait about 20 min and confirm that the cells you selected are still visible and in position before starting the experiment."
