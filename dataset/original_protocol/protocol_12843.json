    "1. Preparation of PCR Products of SSR Markers\nPrepare all chemicals and reagents for PCR reactions including template DNA (30 ng/µL), 2× PCR master mix (containing 2× PCR buffer, 0.4 mM of each dNTP, 3 mM of MgCl2, 0.1 U/µL of Taq DNA polymerase and dyes), 10 µM of each forward and reverse primers, and distilled or deionized water (dH2O).\n\tNOTE: The SSR markers used in the present study were PT51333 (forward primer sequence: 5 '-GCACCTTTGGTTATCCGACA-3 ' and reverse primer sequence: 5 '-TGCTTTAAGTCATGTACCAAATTGA-3 ') and PT50903 (forward primer sequence: 5 '-AAATTTCTTTCGGTGTGATAACTG-3' and reverse primer sequence: 5'- AGAGACTGCCGTTTGATTTGA -3') for tobacco, and CX-43 (forward primer sequence: 5'-TGGGGATGTGAGCTTCTTCT-3' and reverse primer sequence:5'- AGGGTTCCTTTGGGGTGATA-3') and CX-157 (forward primer sequence: 5 '-TCGACGCTGACTTCACTGAC-3 ' and reverse primer sequence: 5 '-GGACAGCTTCACACATTTGC-3 ') for flowering Chinese cabbage.\nPrepare 10 µL of PCR mix for amplification by adding 2 µL of template DNA, 5 µL of 2× PCR master mix, 0.2 µL of each forward primer and reverse primer and 2.6 µL of dH2O.\nPerform PCR amplification reaction in a thermocycler with an initial step of 94 °C for 5 min, follow by 38 cycles of 45 s at 94 °C for denaturation, 45 s at 55 °C for primer annealing and 1 min at 72 °C for extension, and a final extension step of 10 min at 72 °C; then store PCR products at 4 °C for later use.\n2. Preparation of Solutions for Polyacrylamide Gels Casting\nPrepare 1 L of 5× TBE buffer by dissolving 54 g of Tris base and 27.5 g boric acid in dH2O, adding 20 mL of 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0) and adjusting the solution to a final volume of 1, 000 mL with dH2O.\n\tNOTE: TBE buffer can be stored at room temperature for months.",
    "Prepare 2 L of 0.5× TBE buffer by adding 200 mL of 5× TBE buffer to dH2O to a final volume of 2 L, and store at room temperature.\nPrepare a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel solution by dissolving 29 g of molecular biology grade acrylamide and 1 g of molecular biology grade N, N'-methylenebisacrylamide in 0.5× TBE buffer to a final volume of 500 mL. Cover the solution bottle with aluminum foil and store at 4 °C for later use.\n\tCaution: Acrylamide is considered a potent neurotoxin and should be handled with care. Always wear gloves when weighing powder and handling solutions that contain it.\nPrepare a 20% ammonium persulfate (APS) solution by dissolving 2 g of APS with dH2O to a final volume of 10 mL. It can be stored at -20 °C for months.\n\tNOTE: For convenience, 10 mL of 20% APS solution can be aliquoted into 1.5 mL or 2 mL of centrifuge tubes for storage at -20 °C. Thaw and mix well before use.\nPrepare a diluted bind-silane solution by dissolving 3 µL of bind-silane in 0.997 mL of 95% ethanol containing 0.5% of acetic acid. It can be stored at 4 °C for weeks.\n\tCaution: Bind-silane is toxic, wear gloves when handling the solution and keep room ventilated.\n3. Preparation of Polyacrylamide Gels for Electrophoresis\nWash one set of glass plates and spacers with detergent in tap water, followed by a complete rinsing with dH2O. Air dry the plates by setting them in a plate drying rack.\nDisperse 1 mL of bind-silane solution onto the inner surface of a rectangular glass plate, and dry for 5 min.",
    "NOTE: If the bind-silane solution is not spread uniformly on the surface of the plate, the gel may be detached during staining and result in an unsatisfactory staining effect.\nDisperse 1 mL of repel-silane onto the inner surface of a notched glass plate with a swab, wipe off excess repel-silane with tissue paper, and air dry for 5 min.\n\tNOTE: If the repel-silane does not coat the surface of the glass plate uniformly, it may damage the gel by partially stripping.\nAssemble the glass plates with spacers with the notched plate on top, and clamp both sides of the assembly with casting clamps.\nPour appropriate amount (40 mL) of 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel solution to a beaker for the plate set of 33 cm width × 10 cm height and spacer thickness of 1.5 mm, add 20 µL of tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) and 200 µLfresh 20% APS and mix gently.\n\tNOTE: The appropriate amount (40 mL) of gel solution was calculated from the inner volume of the two plates with a thickness of spacers (30 cm × 8.5 cm × 0.15 cm). As for the amount of TEMED and APS for gel polymerization, there is a standard ratio of gel solution to TEMED and APS based on the reference17. The gel solution described above is stored at 4°C. If gel solution is stored at room temperature, 20 µL of TEMED and 100 µL of 20% APS should be used. Gently stir the mixture of gel solution with a glass stick to avoid air bubbles in the solution.\nPour the solution immediately and carefully into the assembled glass plates along the edge of the notched plate, fill the space almost to the top, and insert the comb. Add a small volume of gel solution over the comb.",
    "NOTE: Keep the glass plates horizontal to prevent the gel from leaking. Remove any bubbles with a bubble hook, if necessary.\nAllow the gel to set for 30 min at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: The time for polymerization may change with temperatures of gel solution and environment.\nAfter the gel is fully polymerization, remove the casting clamps and position the plate set in the electrophoresis tank unit with the notched plate facing toward the upper buffer reservoir, and use large clamps to attach the plate set to the tank unit.\nPour 1 L of 0.5× TBE buffer into each of the upper and the lower chambers. Remove the comb and flush all the wells thoroughly with buffer using a pipette or syringe.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that the gel sandwich at the bottom of the plate is completely soaked in buffer without any bubbles.\n4. Running Gels\nLoad about 1 µL of PCR product into each well of the polyacrylamide gel. Load a DNA size ladder to both sides of the gel along with samples of PCR products. Fix the safety cover to the upper buffer chamber.\nConnect the leads to the power supply, matching the color-coded red to red and black to black. Run the gel at a constant voltage of 110 V until the dye reaches a defined position, normally for ~70 min.\n\tNOTE: The voltage and running time can be adjusted according to the size of the PCR products.\n5. Silver Staining for Detecting SSR Markers in a Non-Polyacrylamide Gel",
    "After electrophoresis, drain the buffer from the upper chamber into a large beaker via the valve. Detach the side clamps, remove the plates from the apparatus, carefully separate the notched glass plate along one side with a spatula, and make sure that the gel remains attached to the other glass plate coated with bind silane.\nMake 1 L of fresh impregnation solution by dissolving 1.5 g of AgNO3 in 1 L of dH2O. Prepare 1 L of fresh development solution by dissolving 10 g of NaOH in 900 mL of dH2O, add 1 mL of 37% formaldehyde, and adjust to a final volume of 1 L using dH2O.\n\tNOTE: Wear gloves and handle the above chemicals and solutions with care. It is not necessary to keep the solutions and corresponding steps with the solutions in the dark.\nCarefully rinse the gel and glass plate with ample dH2O to remove the electrophoresis buffer, then place the plate with the gel facing up onto a plastic tray and submerge the gel in 1 L of impregnation solution. Put the tray on a shaker.\nShake the tray gently at 60 r/min for 3-4 min.\n\tNOTE: Shaking time can be adjusted according to the gel thickness and concentration of silver nitrate in the impregnation solution.\nMove the plate out of impregnation solution and put it onto another tray. Rinse the residual impregnation solution off from the surface of the plate and the gel using ample dH2O twice for 3-5 s each.",
    "Place the plate with the gel facing up onto another tray, submerge the plate in 1 L of development solution, then shake the tray gently at 50 r/min for ~3 min. Monitor the appearance of DNA fragments and stop development when the highest ratio of the signal of DNA fragments to the noise of background is observed (this step takes ~3 min).\nRinse the plate and the gel with ample dH2O twice, and dry the gel plate with a tissue paper.\nScan the gel using an appropriate scanner. A resolution of 300 dpi gives a clear visualization of DNA fragments. The gel can also be photographed using a camera.\nThe banding pattern of SSR markers can be scored based on the DNA fragments in the image.\nSubscription Required.
