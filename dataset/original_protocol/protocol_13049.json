    "The experiments were conducted in accordance with recommendations of the Declarations of Helsinki and Tokyo and the Guidelines for the Use of Experimental Animals of the European Community. The experiments were approved by the Animal Care Committee of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. The authorization code for this experiment was IL-55-8-12.\n1. Rat preparation\nObtain approval for experiments from Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\nSelect adult Sprague Dawley rats. Exclude animals that exhibit abnormal physical traits, such as seizures or other motor deficits.\n\tNOTE: For this protocol, we used adult male rats, weighing 300−350 g, aged 4-8 months old. Female rats may be used as well.\nMaintain rats at room temperature (22 °C ± 1 °C), with 12 h light and 12 h dark cycles. Provide rat chow and water ad libitum. House 3 rats per cage.\n\t​NOTE: All rats housed in the same cage must be in the same experimental group.\nRandomly place 120 rats into one of three experimental groups. Use Group 1 (n=60) w as a control group. Induce the experimental group, Group 2 (n=30), with stressors as detailed below. Induce Group 3, the experimental group with treatment (n=30), with anhedonia and subsequently administer antidepressant treatment. The timeline for the experimental protocol can be found in Figure 1.\nMark rats with colored pens at the beginning of the experiment to allow for individual identification.\nPerform all experiments between 6:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m.\nWeigh rats daily throughout procedure for possible weight loss. Weight loss above 20% will exclude rats from the study. See section 3.1.3.\n2. Induction of anhedonia in rats\nChronic Unpredictable Stress model\n\t\nInduce rats from the experimental group and the experimental group with treatment with features of a depressive-like state by the Chronic Unpredictable Stress model, as previously detailed23.",
    "Chronic Unpredictable Stress model\n\t\nInduce rats from the two experimental groups with depressive-like behaviors by the Chronic Unpredictable Stress model, as previously detailed23.\n\t\tNOTE: Rats are exposed to 2 of the 7 stressors daily in a random order; one in the daytime and the second at night for 5 weeks24,25.\nIntroduce the following stressors in random order:\n\t\t\nHouse rats with 6 animals per cage instead of 3 for 18 h.\nTilt cage placement 45° along the vertical axis for 3 h.\nDeprive animals of food for 18 h.\nDeprive animals of water for 18 h and then introduce an empty water bottle.\nMaintain a soiled cage for 8 h with 300 mL of water spilled in the bedding.\nKeep continuous lighting and reverse the light/dark cycle for 48 h per week.\nHeat the environment to 40 °C for 5 min.\nConfirm the development of anhedonia, one of the features of a depression-like state, by performing a sucrose preference test. See section 4.\nAnti-depression therapy\n\t\nAdminister 20 mg/kg imipramine hydrochloride (tricyclic antidepressant) intraperitoneally once per day for 3 weeks to rats from the experimental group26,27,28.\n\t\t​NOTE: A sub-group (n=3 in each set of rats) of the experimental group is administered 0.9% saline (placebo) intraperitoneally once per day for the 3-week duration, at the same volume as the antidepressant treatment group.\n3. The social organization test (complex diving-for-food task)\nNOTE: The experimental apparatus was described in previous studies9,29,30 with minor modifications. All parts of the apparatus should be composed of transparent plexiglass.\nPrepare apparatus and acclimate rats.",
    "Connect two cages (50 cm x 50 cm x 50 cm) to an aquarium (130 cm x 35 cm x 50 cm) via tunnels (45 cm x 15 cm x 15 cm) (Figure 2). Ensure that there is no access from one cage to another without diving into the aquarium25. Maintain water temperature at 25 °C.\nPlace tubes with food pellets (one food pellet in each tube) at one end of the aquarium.\n\t\tNOTE: A reduction in the accessibility of food pellets in the cage of departure should gradually encourage the rat, who would otherwise develop a habit of stealing, to dive to reach the food.\nOn day 1 of the experiment, introduce each group of 6 rats to experimental apparatus without water for 3-hour sessions. Return rats to standard cage after session.\n\t\t\nRestrict rat food access to the 3-hour sessions, with no other access to food during the rest of the day.\nRemove rats that lost more than 20% of their baseline weight from the experiment together with their social group, and give ad libitum food and water.\nManually towel dry rats or provide access to a heat source until dry and before placing them back in their regular housing to avoid hypothermia.\nRepeat these sessions for days 2-3.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Video record rats in the apparatus continuously for 3-hour sessions. Ensure that the camera is set to high definition (720p) and the auto-focus is turned off.\nPerform diving-for-food task\n\t\nOn days 4-17, add water progressively until maximum water level is reached, as described previously4. On days 17-21, maintain maximum water level.\nObserve rats diving for pellet access.\nRecord the following parameters for each rat:\n\t\t\nAssess frequency of entry into the tunnel.\nCount each attempt to dive for food.",
    "NOTE: The travel from cage to aquarium back to a cage should not exceed 5-6 seconds, which will ensure that the pellet remains edible.\nAssess the number of times that food is obtained by attack between rats that do swim for food and rats that do not.\nRecord the number of times food is carried by a rat who swims.\nRecord the time that rats spent in separate cages compared to time spent in the original cage.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: All the data was obtained by continuous visual observation.\n4. Assessment of anhedonia: The sucrose preference test\nAssess anhedonia by the sucrose preference test with minor modification, as previously described23,25,31,32,33. Perform this test on days -6, 0, 35, 41, 62 and 68 of the procedure (see Figure 1 for protocol timeline).\n\t\nAllow rats to consume sucrose solution for 24 h by free access to the two bottles in each cage, containing 100 mL of sucrose solution (1%, w/v).\nAfter 24 h, replace one of the bottles with water for an additional 24 h.\nDeprive rats of water for 12 hours34.\nGive rats both bottles (one with water and one with sucrose). After 4 h, record the volume of both the consumed sucrose solution and water.\nCalculate sucrose preference as sucrose preference (%) = sucrose consumption (mL)/(sucrose consumption (mL) + water consumption (mL)) × 100%.\n\t\t​NOTE: When utilizing the Chronic Unpredictable Stress model in conjunction with a social organization test, we recommend not only recording the mean sucrose and water consumption, but also to note changes in behavior of each individual rat. This will allow for a more specific understanding of behavioral changes within the individual instead of within the group when confronted with a hierarchical model such as the diving-for-food task.\n5. Statistical analysis",
    "Determine comparisons between groups using the Kruskal-Wallis followed by Mann-Whitney for nonparametric data or a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test or the Student's t-test for parametric data.\n\tNOTE: Results are considered statistically significant when p < 0.05, and highly significant when p < 0.01.\nSubscription Required.
