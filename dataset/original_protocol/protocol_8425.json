    "This protocol was approved by the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Boards as a minimal risk study in children and adults. Single- and paired-pulse TMS is considered as safe in children 2 years and older per international expert consensus.24 After explaining the potential risks of TMS to parent/guardian and participant, consent and assent forms are signed if they agree to proceed with the study.\n1. Screening and introduction\nScreen subjects for TMS contraindication(s) using a standardized questionnaire.25\nDemonstrate how TMS works by delivering a magnetic pulse over the operator's own forearm.\nDeliver a TMS pulse over the participant's forearm so that he/she can feel the pulse.\nPlace earplugs in participant's ears for hearing protection.\n2. Surface EMG lead setup and hand positioning\nHave the subject abduct the dominant index finger to identify the first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI). Place the negative electrode over the belly of the FDI, then place the positive electrode between 2nd and 3rd metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints and the ground electrode over the 5th MCP joint.\nPosition the participant's hands with ulnar aspects of both arms and hands resting fully on a pillow, with no anti-gravity effort required (Figure 1).\nHave the participant extend the dominant index finger while the third - fifth fingers are flexed. Then place a game controller pad on the pillow so that the index finger rests on the button used for the racecar S-H task. The rationale for this hand position is that the GO action requires the activation of the FDI to lift the index finger off the button. Therefore, recording EMG tracing of the dominant FDI will probe M1 excitability and inhibition for GO and STOP trials respectively.\n3. Baseline TMS data acquisition",
    "Set the recording parameters for MEP recording - low and high pass filters of 100 and 1000 Hz, sampling rate of 2 kHz.\nObtain baseline TMS measurements using a 90 mm circular TMS coil positioned tangentially to the skull over the vertex with the handle pointing towards the occiput at the optimal position and orientation for producing an MEP in the right FDI by following standard protocol.26 This coil position and orientation should produce an induced posterior-to-anterior current over M1.\n\t\nUse a wax pencil to mark the scalp location once the hotspot was located to ensure that the TMS pulse delivery occurs at the same cortical region.\nPerform twenty trials27 of baseline single-pulse (sp) TMS induced FDI MEPs with both hands at rest using an intensity of 120% of RMT.\nPerform twenty trials of baseline paired-pulse TMS measures of M1 short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) at rest using inter-stimulus interval of 3 ms, 60%*RMT as the conditioning pulse intensity and 120% RMT as the test pulse intensity to quantify M1 inhibitory GABAA-ergic interneuronal activity.28,29,30 Set the inter-trial interval for baseline measurements at 6 ± 0.3 seconds.\n4. S-H behavioral task\nDisplay the Racecar S-H response inhibition task on a monitor directly in front of the subject. Start the experiment by first training subjects on the behavioral task. Tell the subject that the car on the left side of the monitor will begin to move after the button is pressed by adduction of the dominant index finger (Figure 2A).",
    "Tell the participants that the goal for GO trials is to lift the finger as close to but before the 800 ms target as depicted by a vertical line on the screen. The screen will display \"Good Job\" if finger lifts occurs between 700 and 800 ms, otherwise it will display either \"Too Early\" or \"Too Late\". Have the participant practice 10 GO trials.\nProvide training for the STOP task by telling participants that the second set of trials involves the car randomly stopping before the 800 ms target.\n\t\nTell the child to keep his index finger on the button without lifting the finger whenever the car randomly stops. To succeed in these STOP trials, the finger must remain on the button until a checker flag is seen which is programmed to appear 1000 ms after the start of each trial. Inform the participant that if stop signal is presented and finger is lifted before the checker flag, a \"Too Early\" message will appear. Tell the child that a \"Great\" message will be displayed after successful STOP trials.\nHave the child practice 10 STOP trials.",
    "NOTE: The program has a dynamic tracking algorithm. In the actual experiment after training, the first STOP signal occurs at 500 ms. If the participant fails one STOP trial, then the next STOP trial will be easier (i.e. the STOP signal will shift 50 ms away from the 800 ms target). However, if the STOP trial was successful, then the next STOP trial will be more difficult (i.e. the STOP signal will shift 50 ms towards the target). This dynamic tracking process ensures that by the end of the entire experiment, approximately 50% of the STOP trials will be successful while the other half would be failed trials. The STOP signal is programmed to adjust between 300 and 700 ms after start of trial.\nAfter the participants practice GO-only and STOP-only trials, tell them that the next practice block contains a mixture of GO and STOP trials. Have the child perform 20 trials of mixed GO and STOP as a final practice.\n5. Online S-H/TMS experiment\nBefore starting online S-H/TMS experiment, remind the participant to adduct (push down) the dominant index finger to start the trial, to abduct (lift off) finger for GO trials and keep finger on the button for STOP trials. The index finger adduction was chosen to initiate and maintain car movement during each trial because at the time of the TMS pulses (Figure 2A and 2B), the antagonistic first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle, where the EMG lead is placed, would be resting, thus reducing the likelihood of motion artifact in the FDI tracing.\nTell the participant that TMS pulses will be delivered during the S-H task. Instruct the subject that there will be 3 blocks of online S-H TMS trials (3 GO: 1 STOP trial ratio).",
    "NOTE: During GO trials, TMS pulse is programmed to be delivered at 650 ms after the start of each trial. This timing is initially chosen based on prior TMS study showing that increase in M1 excitability associated with movement preparation can be captured in this range.10 For STOP trials, TMS pulse is delivered 150 ms after the stop signal. In successful STOP trials, the index finger does not lift off the button therefore the captured M1 excitability reflects cortical activity related to response inhibition rather than motor preparation or execution.\nPlace the 90 mm circular coil over the vertex using previous wax pencil mark to preferentially stimulate dominant M1 and set the conditioning pulse intensity to 60%*RMT and test pulse to 120%*RMT. Begin the online S-H/TMS experiment. The time required children to finish 120 trials is generally 30-40 minutes.\n6. Racecar Slater-Hammel Behavioral Data\nFor GO trials, determine the reaction time as the finger-lift time relative to the beginning of each trial. Average each block. For STOP trials, the finger-lift time determines success, whereas the car stop signal time (i.e. Stop Signal Delay; SSD) is the time interval from the start of the trial to the point where the car randomly stops. Due to the dynamic tracking process, the stop signal time converges towards a ~50% success/fail average.\nCalculate the Stop Signal Reaction Time (SSRT) by subtracting the average car-stop time from the average finger lift time on GO trials (SSRT = average GO reaction time – average stop signal time [i.e. SSD]). Average all the SSD by block and calculate an SSRT for each block.\n7. TMS Data Processing",
    "Quantify TMS during each trial produced an MEP using peak-peak amplitude measured in millivolts. Exclude trials for movement artifacts (EMG areas under the curve greater than 70 microvolts over 100 ms) prior to the TMS pulse.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
