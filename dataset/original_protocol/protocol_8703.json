    "1. Setup Diluter for Larval Sturgeon Exposure to Aqueous Copper Concentrations\nSet up exposures using a flow-through system such as a modified Mount and Brungs12 diluter system following guidelines by the ASTM International13,14,15.\nSelect 25 µg/L as the high copper concentration based on previous test results where effects were observed around 4-6 µg/L. Use reagent grade copper II sulfate pentahydrate (>98% purity) and mix up a test stock solution.\n\tNOTE: Example concentration series for the exposures are 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, 1.0625, and 0 µg/L. Using 50% serial dilutions starting with 25 µg/L as the high concentration will target a range of concentrations observed to cause behavioral impairment.\nPrepare the test stock solution in a volumetric flask 48 hours prior to the initiation of the exposure and set to deliver to spike the diluter mixing chamber using an automated syringe dispenser.\nUse a spreadsheet template to determine the weight of chemical to be added to 1 L of deionized water that will result in 25 µg/L copper concentration, when diluter mixing chamber is spiked with 1 ml of the test stock solution.\n\tNOTE: Figure 1 depicts an example of a spreadsheet template for chemical stock preparation for diluter toxicity tests.\nWeigh out 195 mg of reagent grade copper II sulfate pentahydrate using an analytical balance and pour into a 1 L volumetric flask and mix with 1 L of deionized water for a stock concentration of 48.65 mg/L.\nPlace the intake tube from the automated syringe dispenser into the test stock solution and set the spike volume to 1 ml and turn the diluter on by flipping the power switch and let cycle for 48 hr allow it to equilibrate to the corresponding copper concentration prior to stocking sturgeon.",
    "Attach an in-line 4-way flow splitter16 to each delivery line to partition water flow to each of the four replicate exposure chambers in the diluter water bath. Gravity feed the water. Cycle the water through the diluter when the power to the diluter turns on and a solenoid valve is opened allowing water to flow to the dilution tanks. Set chiller unit to 15 °C and turn on water pump to circulate water in the diluter water bath.\n\tNOTE: This process is regulated by the use of an automated timer.\nSet the diluter to cycle every 30 min using the automated timer and to deliver 250 ml of test water with each cycle, resulting in 12 volume additions per day to each replicate test chamber.\nSelect exposure test chambers based on the size of the sturgeon to maintain acceptable loading rate which is <10 g fish wet weight/L in any chamber at any given time. For example, to conduct exposures with 30 day-post-hatch (dph) white sturgeon (average weight in grams 0.17 g) use 12 x 21.5 cm2 glass jars with a 4 cm hole in the side. Cover this side with a 30 micron mesh stainless steel screen to allow for flow through of the test water. The volume of test water in the exposure jars is 1 L.\nUsing a 50 ml plastic syringe take two replicate 50 ml water samples at each concentration for a total of 12 samples and dispense test water into 100 ml glass beakers and measure dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, conductivity, pH, alkalinity, hardness, total ammonia, major cations, major anions and dissolved organic carbon using standard commercial equipment and follow the manufacturer's instructions.\n\tNOTE: samples should be taken at the initiation and end of exposure.",
    "To collect sub-samples for chemical analysis, use a 25 ml plastic syringe, draw up approximately 24 ml of test water from the exposure chambers using a sipper straw attached to the syringe instead of a needle.\nRemove the sipper straw from the syringe and place a polypropylene filter cartridge housing a 0.45 µm pore size, polyethersulfone membrane on the plastic syringe.\nPush 4 ml of test water through the filter and dispose.\nDispense the remaining 20 ml of test water through the filter into an acid-cleaned polyethylene bottle and acidify to 1% volume/volume with high-purity, 16 M nitric acid for storage of up to 3 months.\n\tNOTE: Samples for chemical analysis should be taken at the initiation, middle and end of exposure to confirm copper concentrations.\nPerform chemical analysis using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry following U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Method 6020a17\nAfter taking all water samples and the diluter is cycling, stock 10 (random, haphazardly) sturgeon in each replicate test chamber. Collect the sturgeon from the culture tank where they are housed using a small mesh non-abrasive net. Place sturgeon in a small bucket with culture water. A total of 240 fish are needed to start the exposure.\nDo not feed the fish during the exposure.\n\tNOTE: Please refer to Figure 1 for a visual setup of the diluter layout.\nRead the test every day for the duration of the exposure and record fish mortality and monitor swimming behavior.\n\tNOTE: Other endpoints to look for include lethargy, loss of equilibrium, changes in respiration, changes in pigmentation, position fish are in the water column, hiding activity and any other abnormalities that can be visually identified.\n\tNOTE: Read the test at the same time each day for consistency.",
    "Measure and quantify swimming activity (time fish spent moving, velocity and the distance moved) using a commercially available digital tracking software program.\n2. Observations and Mortality Counts During Exposure\nVisually inspect each test chamber and note mortality and observations of abnormal behavior using a behavioral checklist (Table 1) on the datasheets approximately at the same time daily during the 96 hr exposure, preferably in the morning.\n\tNOTE: Behaviors that are strikingly, uncharacteristically, subjectively, qualitatively different from the controls are considered abnormal. Optimally the observer is unaware of the treatments.\n\tNOTE: The loss of equilibrium is defined as the inability of fish to maintain an upright position within the water column and immobility is defined as the inability of fish to move or swim unless prodded. Other abnormalities such as lethargy, hyperactivity, increases or decreases in respiration, color changes, tremors, spasms, bloated abdomens, position in the water column and any other unusual swimming patterns should also be recorded on the data sheet.\n\tNOTE: Refer to Video 1 for examples of abnormal behavior.\nRecord and remove dead sturgeon daily.\nUsing a hand held Dissolved Oxygen (DO) meter with probe measure the dissolved oxygen in situ and record water temperature in two replicates of each exposure concentration and record on the data sheet.\n3. Videotaping Swimming Activity\nCapture video data samples using a hand-held video camera mounted to a tripod positioned directly overhead of the testing chamber to document behavioral abnormalities.\nTo quantify swimming activity, cut a piece of PVC pipe 13 cm in diameter and 13 cm tall to use as the test arena (Figure 1). Place the PVC pipe in the diluter within each corresponding copper concentration exposure tanks. Use the area within the PVC pipe as the test arena as this is large enough for sturgeon to swim about freely.",
    "At the end of the 96 hr exposure, randomly subsample 5 surviving sturgeon from each copper concentration to measure for swimming activity and place them in to the test arena using a small mesh net.\n\tNOTE: In the higher test concentrations where sturgeon mortality was prevalent, any remaining surviving sturgeon should be used to measure swimming activity and in some cases might be less than 5.\nAfter placing the fish in to the test arena, allow the fish to acclimate for a period of 30 min.\n\tNOTE: Successful, error free analysis of the video requires a high contrast image of the fish against a background with a minimum of structure that might obscure or hide the image of the fish. The image of the fish must be in good focus and must be free of surface glare or free of distortions due to moving water so the diluter system must be turned off.\nAfter 30 min, turn the video camera ON and set to REC to record the swimming activity for a period of 2 min.\nEuthanize the fish after taking the video recordings to determine behavior.\nPlace sturgeon in a concentrated solution of tricaine methanesulfonate (MS222) water for at least 10 min to allow for cessation of opercular movement.\n\tNOTE: A concentration of at least 250 mg/L is recommended and might be much higher for certain species.\nPlace the euthanized sturgeon in a plastic zip lock bag and place in the freezer for disposal at a later time. Turn the video camera OFF and transfer all video files to a computer for post processing using digital tracking software.\n4. Measures of Swimming Activity from Video Playback",
