    "All procedures conducted on the rats in this study adhered to the National Standard for Laboratory Animal Welfare and Ethics Review Guidelines (2018) officially adopted by the People's Republic of China and Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals from the National Academies Press15. This protocol is composed of three main steps. Firstly, the rat jackets are tailored and fitted based on the individual body shapes of rats with different weights. Next, acupuncture manipulation is carried out following standard procedures. Lastly, the rats are suspended in their jackets while the needles remain in place to accommodate the need for simultaneous interventions among rats within the same group.\n1. Pre-needling preparation\nProduction of the rat jacket\n\t\nWeigh the rats and measure their body shape before making their jackets. To verify the suitability of this protocol for rats of varying weights, select rats weighing 220 g, 300 g, 400 g, and 520 g for independent measurements of their bodily dimensions, encompassing measurements from a to f, as depicted in Figure 2.\n\t\tNOTE: The correlation between the bodily proportions of rats and their corresponding jacket sizes is also presented in Figure 2. The pertinent body length parameters for rats of different weights are recorded in Table 1.\nCut a rectangular piece of thick, dark fabric to make a rat jacket. Use the fabric with unfolded width equal to the circumference measured around the thickest part of the rat's abdomen. The length of the fabric is equal to the distance from the rat's nose tip to the base of its tail (see Figure 2).\nFold the fabric in half and cut off the top left corner at an angle of about 45°-65° to form a right trapezoid (see Figure 3A).",
    "Sew the two sides on the left tightly with cotton thread. Refer to Figure 1B and Figure 3B for guidance.\nCut two small holes, one on each side of the fabric, for the rat's upper and lower limbs to pass through (see Figure 3C). The distance between the two upper limbs determines the spacing between the upper holes of the rat jacket. The distance between the two lower limbs determines the spacing between the lower holes of the rat jacket.\nUse the longitudinal distance between the rat's armpit and the front of the ilium to serve as the spacing between the upper and lower holes of the rat jacket. Use the circumference of the shoulder joint to determine the circumference of the upper hole in the rat jacket. Use the circumference of the hip joint for the circumference of the lower hole in the rat jacket.\nBeside each hole, sew a long cloth strap that can be crossed and wrapped tightly around the body from the opening end of the jacket to fix the rat.\nRat jacket-wearing method\n\t\nWear gloves before proceeding to dress the rat in the jacket. Begin by holding the middle and back part of the rat jacket with one hand on the table. With the other hand, hold the rat's tail from its feeding cage and gently place it into the jacket.\nAs the rat moves forward, its head will reach the headgear of the jacket. At this point, use both hands to carefully pull its left and right upper limbs out of the holes in the jacket.",
    "Take the tying rope from the opening end of the jacket, cross it over from left to right, and wrap it securely around the rat's trunk. Tie it tightly on the opposite side of the trunk to ensure proper fixation. Following the restraint of the rat's upper limbs, repeat the same procedure to fix its lower limbs.\nTake precautions to avoid getting bitten or scratched by the rat's claws when pulling its limbs out of the jacket holes. Ensure that the tightness of the rope is appropriately adjusted, i.e., not too tight to cause local limb ischemia and hypoxia in rats, and not too loose, allowing the rat to escape easily (see Video 1).\nFixation rack and S-shaped iron hooks\n\t\nThe fixation rack consists of two heavy iron trays (24 cm in length, 12 cm in width, and 2 cm in height) and an iron column (60 cm in length) that is firmly welded on each tray. Fix a solid iron stick (145 cm in length) at the same height on the two iron columns using a screw connection structure that can be adjusted and maintained at a fixed height (see Figure 4A).\nFor connecting the rat wearing the jacket to the iron stick, use the S-shaped hooks (11 cm in diameter). Wrap one end of the hook around the strap on the jacket while the other end is hung on the iron stick. Use two S-shaped hooks to secure the rat onto the stick. Please refer to Figure 1D and Figure 4B for the overall structure.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65652/65652fig02.jpg",
    "Figure 2: Corresponding diagram of rat body shape and matched rat jacket size. In the diagram, the parameter a represents the transverse distance at the back of the joint between the upper limbs and the rat's trunk. This value is utilized as the spacing measurement between the penetrating holes for the upper limbs of the rat jacket. Similarly, parameter b represents the transverse distance on the back where the bilateral lower limbs of the rat connect with the trunk. This measurement determines the spacing of the penetrating holes for the lower limbs of the rat jacket. The parameter c signifies the circumference of the thickest part of the rat's abdomen, which can be utilized as the width measurement for the fabric of the rat's jacket. The parameter d represents the distance from the rat's armpit to the front of its ilium, determining the longitudinal distance between the upper and lower holes of the jacket. The parameter e corresponds to the longitudinal distance from the rat's nose tip to the base of its tail, serving as the length measurement for the rat's jacket cloth. The parameter f denotes the circumference of the articulation connecting the upper limb and the rat's trunk, serving as the circumference of the hole through which the upper limbs pass. The parameter g represents the circumference of the joint connecting the lower limbs and the rat's trunk, determining the circumference of the hole through which the lower limbs pass.

(A) Plane exterior view of the rat jacket. The shape of the rat's jacket resembles a right-angled trapezoid, with separate openings on the left and right sides for the rat's upper and lower limbs to pass through. (B) Unfolded exterior view of the rat jacket. The closure of the headgear creates a semi-closed cavity, which serves as a crucial component to entice rats to enter. (C) Side view of a rat clothed with the jacket. Once the rat's limbs pass through the openings in the clothing, the straps are crossed over the ventral surface of the trunk and securely fastened at the back with appropriate tension. This ensures that the rat is relatively immobilized. (D) Abdominal view of a rat clothed with the rat jacket. The ventral surface of the jacket exposes the rat's abdominal skin, enabling convenient access for acupuncture at ventral points.

    "Figure 4: Diagram depicting the physical appearance and usage of the elevated fixation rack. (A) Elevated fixation rack. This rack consists primarily of two vertical iron columns (60 cm in length) welded to each tray, along with a long horizontal iron stick (145 cm in length) placed parallel to the ground. Screws are used to secure the horizontal stick at the same height as the vertical columns. (B) Rat suspension on the fixation rack. Rats wearing the rat jackets are securely fastened to the fixation rack using two S-shaped hooks per rat. (C) Simultaneous electroacupuncture treatment in multiple rats. To prevent any potential interference resulting from tail movement, it was necessary to maintain proper spacing among the rats, equivalent to the length of a rat's tail.

Electroacupuncture procedure\nRoutine preparation\n\t\nPlace the fixation rack on a horizontal desktop or ground.\nPrior to the needling procedure, remove the fur around the acupoints using an electric shaver to ensure complete exposure. When the acupoint to be punctured is located on the abdomen of the rat, such as Guanyuan (CV4, about 25 mm below the navel), shorten the width of rat clothing appropriately to expose abdominal acupoints.\nLocate the acupoint from the gap on the midline of the abdomen that is not covered by the rat jacket (see Figure 3D) and then inject the needle.\nWhen the acupoints to be punctured are on the head of the rat, such as Baihui (GV20, located at the middle of the parietal bone), make a small incision at the corresponding position on the head to fully expose the skin around GV20 (See Figure 1C).",
    "When acupuncturing acupoints on the limbs of rats, such as Neiguan (PC6, on the inner side of the forelimb, between the radial and ulnar sutures about 3 mm away from the wrist joint) in the upper limb or Zusanli (ST36, on the posterolateral side of the knee joint, about 2 mm below the fibula head) in the lower limb, due to the obvious exposure of the acupoints, use one hand to assist in fixing the limb, while the other can directly perform the acupuncture operation.\nWhen the acupoint is located on the back or waist of a rat, such as Shenshu (BL23, below the 2nd lumbar vertebrae, 6 mm apart from the midline of the back), cut an opening approximately 2 cm wide in the center of the rat's jacket to fully expose the skin of the corresponding site (See Figure 1C).\nDress the rat in the jacket. After disinfecting the local skin of acupoints with alcohol swabs, begin the acupuncture procedure.\nNeedling technique: Locate the acupoint accurately. Insert a sterile disposable acupuncture needle (0.16 mm x 7 mm) into the rat's acupoint at the appropriate depth.\nElectroacupuncture operation\n\t\nWrap the electrode wire around the horizontal iron rod. This step reduces the risk of the needle falling out due to gravitational force acting on the electroacupuncture clip. Then, attach the end of the electrode wire securely onto the needle handle.\nSwitch on the power and select the appropriate frequency, current, and time parameters. In this experiment, the parameters were set to 2 Hz, 1 mA, and 15 min. Once the parameters are adjusted, commence the electroacupuncture treatment process (See Video 2 and Video 3).",
    "Simultaneous electroacupuncture on rats: During treatment, suspend the rats in the same group together on the iron stick using the S-shaped hooks and let them undergo electroacupuncture intervention simultaneously.\nNOTE: The iron stick should not only be sturdy but also long enough to treat a group of rats at the same time. In this experiment, while ensuring appropriate spacing and no interference among the rats, 3-4 rats can be treated simultaneously (see Figure 4C).\nObservation of rat responses during electroacupuncture treatment: Evaluate the suitability of this fixation method for electroacupuncture in rats based on the following factors, such as the number of personnel required to complete the operation, time taken to fix a rat, the rats' response during the electroacupuncture treatment, the number of needles dropped during the procedure, and any accidental deaths that might occur during the operation.\nRemoval of the needles\n\t\nOnce the pre-set time is completed, the electroacupuncture apparatus will automatically shut off. Remove the small clip that is connected to the needle handle and carefully remove the acupuncture needle from beneath the rat's skin, thereby concluding the electroacupuncture treatment process.\nLoosen the straps, lift the head cover of the rat's jacket, and position the rat above the cage. The rat will then be free to release itself from the jacket and enter the cage independently (see Video 4).\nVideo 2. Needling acupoints in the lumbar region.
