    "Plant growth conditionsNote: The preparation of Arabidopsis NahG plants is a key step in obtaining a satisfactory transient gene expression/protein expression. In this protocol, ~4 weeks old Arabidopsis NahG plants are used for Agrobacterium infiltration. Sow seeds in water-soaked soil mix in a plant pot. Cover the pot with cling film and place it in a growth chamber with 8 h light/16 h dark cycle at 21 °C.Grow until the seedlings have two true leaves (around 7-10 days).Carefully transplant seedlings to the final destination in seed trays with 40 cavities.Grow plants for approximately 3 more weeks inside the growth chamber with 8 h light/16 h dark cycle at 21 °C.Plants are ready for infiltration when they have a robust rosette of 10-12 leaves and have not started flowering.Agrobacterium culturesNote: This protocol can be used with, at least, three different commonly used strains of Agrobacterium: LBA4404, GV3101 and C58C1.Using a glycerol stock and a sterile toothpick, streak the Agrobacterium clone(s) to be used in LB solid plates supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics. Place the plates inside a 28 °C incubator for 48 h to obtain fresh and single colonies.The day before starting the infiltration, start liquid Agrobacterium cultures in LB liquid medium using the fresh colonies on the plates. Pick Agrobacterium biomass from a single colony, using a sterile toothpick, place it inside a sterile Erlenmeyer flask with 20 ml LB liquid media supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics, and culture them at 28 °C and 180 rpm overnight.InfiltrationAgrobacterium preparationPour saturated cultures into 50 ml Falcon tubes. Spin down cells at 4,000 x g for 10 min.Discard LB medium supernatant by decanting. Eliminate as much supernatant as possible. Resuspend with vortex the cell pellets using 1 volume of freshly prepared infiltration buffer.",
    "After resuspension, leave cultures for 2-4 h in darkness at room temperature.Prepare a 1/20 dilution of the saturated culture, measure OD600 and calculate necessary volume to have a final OD600 of 0.05. Dilute using infiltration buffer.Infiltration procedureFill a 1 or 2 ml needleless syringe with the resuspended culture at a final OD600 of 0.05. Perform the infiltration by pressing the syringe (without needle) on the abaxial side of the leaf while exerting counter-pressure with a fingertip on the adaxial side. Observe how the liquid spreads within the leaf if the infiltration is successful. Infiltrate whole leaves (ca. 100 µl of bacterial suspension/leave).Dry the excess of culture from the leaf surface using tissue paper (Figure 1, Video 1).Two to four days after infiltration, observe fluorescence of infiltrated proteins or harvest infiltrated leaves to do a protein extraction.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180614/20180614191820_4078.jpgFigure 1.
