    "1. Fabrication of the 3D acoustic assembly device\nBegin by preparing four 1 mm thick PMMA sheets through laser cutting30, and then proceed to glue them together to form a square chamber with an inner width of 21 mm and a height of 10 mm.\nNext, attach another 1 mm thick PMMA sheet to the bottom of the chamber to serve as a holder for the bioink.\nCarefully affix three lead zirconate titanate (PZT) transducers (each measuring 20 mm in length, 10 mm in width, 0.7 mm in thickness, and with a primary resonant frequency of 3 MHz, see Table of Materials) to the exterior of the three orthogonal walls of the chamber, respectively. Ensure that the bottom PZT transducer is centered beneath the chamber.\nSolder wires to the two conductive areas of each PZT transducer.\nFinally, secure the device onto a hollow base to prevent the bottom PZT from coming into contact with other countertops.\n2. Setting up the acoustic assembly system\nBegin by mounting the acoustic device onto a microscope stage, allowing for top-view observation of the chamber's interior.\nPosition a digital microscope on the side of the device that is free from PZT transducers, enabling side-view observation of the chamber's interior.\nIndependently connect the wires from the three PZT transducers in series to three power amplifiers and three output channels of function generators (see Table of Materials).\nProgram the settings on the function generators for each PZT transducer, specifying parameters such as sinusoidal waveform, frequency, and amplitude.\nTo ensure sterilization, fill the chamber of the acoustic device with 75% alcohol for 5 min, followed by a thorough cleaning with sterile PBS solution. Subsequently, irradiate the chamber with UV light in a clean bench for a minimum of 1 h.\n3. Cell culture and harvest procedure",
    "Begin by culturing C3A cells, a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, in a T25 cell culture flask using Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (see Table of Materials).\nWhen the C3A cells reach approximately 80% confluence, perform cell passage as follows: firstly, wash the bottom of the culture flask twice with PBS. Then, add 2 mL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA to the cell culture flask and incubate at 37 °C to facilitate cell detachment. Stop the trypsinization process by adding 2 mL of complete culture medium.\nTransfer the cell solution to a 15 mL tube, and centrifuge it at 200 × g for 5 min at room temperature to obtain a cell pellet.\n4. Preparation of the bioink\nPrepare a 6% (w/v) GelMA solution containing 0.5% (w/v) lithium phenyl-2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylphosphinate (LAP) by dissolving 0.3 g of GelMA and 0.025 g of LAP (see Table of Materials) in 5 mL of phosphate buffer solution (PBS). Allow the mixture to sit in a 47 °C water bath for 1 h.\nBefore mixing with cells, pass the GelMA solution through a 0.22 µm filter (see Table of Materials) for sterilization.\nResuspend the cell pellet mentioned above (step 3.3) in cell culture medium. Stain a small volume of cells with a 0.4% trypan blue solution and then use a clean hemocytometer for cell counting.\nMix an appropriate amount of C3A cells, calculated based on the cell density obtained above, with the sterilized GelMA solution to prepare the bioink with a cell density of 2 × 106 cells/mL.",
    "For visualization of the assembled cell spheroids, pre-stain C3A cells by incubating them with 2 µM cell tracker (DiO dye, see Table of Materials) at 37 °C for 20 min. Subsequently, wash the labeled cells with fresh cell culture medium three times before use.\n5. Assembling the cell spheroids using the acoustic device\nPipette more than 1 mL of the bioink into the sterilized chamber. Ensure that the face-to-face distance between the liquid surface and the chamber bottom is an integer multiple of half the acoustic wavelength.\n\tNOTE: One can control this distance by adjusting the volume of bioink added. The acoustic wavelength (λ) can be estimated using the formula λ = c/f, where c represents the speed of sound in the medium, and f is the frequency of the PZT transducer.\nTurn on the function generator and power amplifier to initiate the actuation of each PZT transducer.\n\tNOTE: It is recommended to individually actuate each PZT transducer first to achieve the optimal parallel-line cellular pattern. This can be achieved by conducting a frequency sweep with a step size of 0.001 MHz near the primary resonant frequency for each PZT transducer. Afterward, simultaneously apply these optimal signals to all three PZT transducers to obtain the expected 3D-dot cellular pattern. Before applying each input signal, ensure that the cells are evenly dispersed in the bioink by gently agitating.\nCrosslink the bioink using blue light (405 nm, 60 mW/cm2, 30 s) to create a 3D hydrogel scaffold that encapsulates the cell aggregates assembled acoustically. Afterward, turn off the function generator and power amplifier.\nCarefully transfer the 3D hydrogel scaffold from the chamber into a Petri dish and cut it into small pieces (e.g., 2 mm × 2 mm × 2 mm) using a clean razor.\nAdd cell culture medium for cultivation.",
    "​NOTE: Remember to change the culture medium every day.\n6. Retrieving cell spheroids\nBegin by observing spheroid formation at different layers of the scaffolds using an inverted microscope.\nAfter 3 days of culture, remove the culture medium and thoroughly wash the hydrogel scaffolds twice with PBS.\nIncubate the scaffolds with more than 2 mL of GelMA lysis buffer at a 1: 200 dilution with cell culture medium for 30 min in a cell incubator. This step aims to dissolve the hydrogel scaffolds.\nTransfer the solution from the previous step into a tube and then centrifuge it at 200 × g for 5 min at room temperature to obtain the cell spheroid pellet.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in fresh culture medium for downstream applications.\n7. Spheroid viability analysis\nAssess the viability of cell spheroids either within the hydrogel scaffolds or in the retrieved spheroids using a live/dead staining kit (see Table of Materials).\nIncubate the samples at different culture time points with 1 mL of PBS solution containing 1 µL of Calcein-AM and 2 µL of Propidium Iodide (PI) for 15 min at 37 °C.\nFor samples within the hydrogel scaffolds, wash them directly with PBS twice. For retrieved spheroids, centrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min at roomtemperature to obtain a spheroid pellet, and wash it twice before observation.\nObserve the samples using a fluorescence microscope and capture the fluorescence images.\nCalculate the ratio of the area stained with Calcein-AM to the total area stained with both Calcein-AM and PI using ImageJ to determine spheroid viability.\nSubscription Required.
