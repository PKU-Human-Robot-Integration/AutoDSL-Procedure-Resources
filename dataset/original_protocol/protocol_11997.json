    "1. Culturing Stentor and Establishing Stentor Cultures from Single Cells or Cell Fragments\nPrepare Chlamydomonas reinhardtii culture to be used as food for Stentor.\n\t\nObtain Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells from a commercial supplier (Table of Materials).\nEstablish a 500 mL liquid culture of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in commercially available TAP media using sterile technique13.\nKeep the Chlamydomonas culture under a lamp at a concentration near saturation (at O.D. of about 1) by diluting it with TAP media twice a week.\n\t\tNote: The Chlamydomonas culture can be grown on a shaker.\nRegularly check whether the Chlamydomonas culture is healthy by placing a drop of culture on a slide, covering it with a coverslip, and checking it under a microscope at 40X magnification.\n\t\tNote: Do not use the culture for Stentor feeding if it is contaminated with bacteria or if Chlamydomonas cells are aggregated into clusters. If either of these problems occurs, start a new Chlamydomonas culture.\nObtain Stentor coeruleus cells from a commercial supplier (Table of Materials).\nIf Stentor cells are needed from their natural habitat, collect them from a pond, lake, or river11.\n\t\nTo collect Stentor from a pond, lake, or river, find an area with some vegetation where the water is relatively calm, shady, and clear.\n\t\tNote: There is a higher probability of finding Stentor at the locations where duckweed grows.\nCollect at least 2 L of water in a container that is easy to pour from.\nAfter detritus and particulate matter have settled to the bottom of the container, gently fill a few smaller containers to examine for Stentor, waiting for a few seconds after each collection for the detritus to settle in the large container.",
    "Once the collection of samples is completed at a location, move to a new location that is at least 10 m away and repeat the collection of samples there.\n\t\tNote: Not every pond has a Stentor population, so multiple ponds may have to be sampled.\nReturn with the samples to the lab and transfer the water from the containers into individual Petri dishes.\nIn each Petri dish, search for Stentor under a stereomicroscope with oblique light at 5X magnification. Transfer individual Stentor cells using a 1 mL pipette into a well of a glass spot plate containing at least 100 µL of commercially available pasteurized spring water (PSW).\n\t\tNote: Stentor cells have a trumpet-like shape when they are attached to a substrate (Figure 1). Swimming Stentor cells are less extended than the cells attached to a substrate (Video 1).\nWash Stentor in PSW at least 3x. Perform the washes by removing about 90% of the water from the well while keeping Stentor cells in the well, followed by adding 500 µL of PSW into the well.\n\t\tNote: Before handling Stentor using pipettes with pipette tips of 10 µL or smaller, cut about 0.5 mm off the end of the pipette tip with scissors to avoid wounding the cells due to shear forces that are generated as a large cell flows through too small of a tip opening.\nPrepare Chlamydomonas before each feeding of Stentor.\n\t\nTransfer 1 mL of Chlamydomonas culture prepared as in Step 1.1 into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 2,095 x g for 3 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspended the pellet in 1 mL of PSW. Centrifuge at 2,095 x g for 3 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 500 µL of PSW.",
    "Note: Thus, washed and concentrated Chlamydomonas will be referred to as “prepared Chlamydomonas” in the following steps. TAP media is detrimental to Stentor, thus washing Chlamydomonas before feeding Stentor is important.\nIf a clonal Stentor culture is needed, start the culture from an individual Stentor cell or a cell fragment.\n\t\nSince single Stentor cells do not grow well in PSW, prepare conditioned media by filter sterilizing 500 µL of media from an existing, healthy Stentor culture.\nTransfer 500 µL of conditioned media to one of the wells of a glass spot plate.\nTransfer one Stentor into the well of the glass spot plate containing conditioned media. Use as little medium as possible to make the transfer.\nFeed each Stentor 5 µL of prepared Chlamydomonas every 48 h. When Stentor divide, count the number of cells in the well and add 5 µL of prepared Chlamydomonas per cell.\nKeep Stentor in a shaded place since the cells are sensitive to light (for example, in clear plastic boxes covered with paper towels).\nExchange Stentor medium in the well with fresh conditioned medium every 96 h.\n\t\t\nPrepare fresh conditioned media as in Step 1.5.1.\nMake all Stentor cells detach from the bottom of the well by gently pipetting the liquid up and down in the well.\nCarefully aspirate the liquid from the well using a 1 mL pipette, making sure all the cells remain in the well. Add 500 µL of fresh conditioned media to the well.\nWhen the number of cells in the well exceeds 20, move the cells to a larger container, for example, a wide-mouth glass jar.\n\t\t\nAdd 20 mL of PSW into an autoclaved wide-mouth glass jar.\n\t\t\tNote: Autoclaving of glassware for Stentor can be replaced with careful washing and rinsing.",
    "Carefully pipette the media up and down in the well to detach all the cells from the bottom of the well. Collect all Stentor cells using a 1 mL pipette tip and gently transfer them to the glass jar.\nDo not tighten the lids on the jars with Stentor cultures, to allow sufficient access to air.\nAdd PSW to the jar every 48 h to keep Stentor density at about 20 cells/mL. Estimate the density of cells by eye.\n\t\tNote: Alternatively, use a 1 mL pipette to bubble air into the jar to make cells detach from the walls, pipette up 1 mL of the culture, and count the number of cells in the pipette tip.\nEvery 48 h, feed prepared Chlamydomonas to Stentor cultures in jars (see Step 1.4). Start with feeding the culture with 200 µL of prepared Chlamydomonas. As the volume of the culture increases, gradually increase the amount of prepared Chlamydomonas used for feeding up to 1 mL.\nWhen the culture volume reaches about 90% of the jar’s capacity, transfer the culture to a bigger container.\n\t\t\nPipette the culture inside the jar, up and down, with a 1 mL pipette to detach Stentor from the glass.\nPour the entire contents of the jar into a 2-cup glass container.\nRinse the jar with about 25 mL of PSW into the 2-cup glass container to collect the remaining Stentor.\nMaintain healthy cultures in 2-cup glass containers.\n\t\nFeed Stentor cultures 2 mL of prepared Chlamydomonas per 100 mL of culture every 4 - 5 days. Add PSW to the glass container every 4 - 5 days to keep Stentor density at about 20 cells/mL.\n\t\tNote: 450 mL is the maximum volume a 2-cup container holds.",
    "Once a week, inspect the cultures under a 5X dissecting microscope for rotifers, fungus, and other growth. To prolong the health of the culture, remove contaminating microorganisms along with abnormally shaped and colorless Stentor cells using a 1 mL pipette.\nWhen the glass container is about 90% full, split the culture.\n\t\t\nAdd 25 mL of PSW to the glass container. Use a 25 mL pipette to pipette up and down to detach Stentor from the glass. Move about 50% of the culture into a new 2-cup glass container.\nAdd 25 mL of PSW to both cultures and continue maintaining the two cultures as described in this section of the protocol.\n\t\t\tNote: Since Stentor cells are sensitive to high temperature, maintain the temperature at 25 °C or lower in the room where the cultures are kept. Alternatively, the cultures can be kept in an incubator. Refer to Table 1 for troubleshooting of Stentor culturing.\n2. Inducing Regeneration by Cutting Stentor Cells\nUse a needle puller to make several needles from capillary tubes using the program as follows: heat - 735, pull - 100, velocity - 110, time - 150, pressure - 400.\nPrepare a 4% methylcellulose solution in 50 mL of PSW.\n\t\nAdd 1 g of methylcellulose (viscosity: 1500 cP) to 50 mL of PSW.\nIncubate at 4 °C for at least 8 h to facilitate the dissolution of methylcellulose.\nKeep 4% methylcellulose solution at room temperature.\nPrepare a glass spot plate for storing the cell fragments after performing the cuts.\n\t\nFilter sterilize media from a healthy culture, 500 mL per glass spot plate well needed.\nTransfer 500 mL of sterilized media in each of the wells needed.",
    "Collect one healthy Stentor (having a defined trumpet shape, vibrant blue-green color, and no large vacuoles) in a 2 µL droplet and place it on a coverslip or slide. Add 2 µL of 4% methylcellulose (Figure 2). Let Stentor slow down before cutting it (Video 2).\nHold the glass needle as parallel to the cutting surface as possible to prevent breaking the needle.\nUsing a stereo dissecting microscope, locate the tip of the glass needle and move it closer to the cell (Figure 3A). Observe the Stentor contract upon contact with the needle (Figure 3B and C).\n\tNote: If the cell is in an orientation that makes separating the anterior end from the posterior end difficult, rotate it very gently with the side of the needle.\nGently press on the contracted Stentor with the side of the glass needle to cut the cell in two (Figure 3D and E, Video 3). Move the two fragments apart ensuring that there is no cytoplasmic connection between them, to avoid fragment fusion (Figure 3F).\nCheck whether both fragments have at least one macronuclear node each by examining the fragments under a dissecting microscope with oblique illumination.\n\tNote: Having at least one macronuclear node is essential for cell survival. The cell may shed its pellicle (transparent shell) along with the blue-green pigment during or after the cut. In most cases, this will not affect the long-term viability of the cell.\nMove the fragments into wells of a glass spot plate prepared in Step 2.3.\nCut multiple cells because a fraction of the cut cells will not regenerate.",
    "If performing multiple cuts in one session, replace the glass needle when it becomes heavily coated with Stentor residue or when its tip is broken. Alternatively, clean the needle by wiping it gently on a piece of silicon spacer.\n\tNote: Glass needles can be used for multiple cell cutting sessions.\nKeep the glass spot plate with cell fragments in a humidity chamber.\nProceed to Section 4 of the protocol for details on imaging and interpretation of Stentor regeneration results.\n3. Inducing Regeneration of Membranellar Band and Oral Apparatus by Sucrose or Urea Treatment\nMembranellar band and oral apparatus removal using sucrose\n\t\nPrepare a 25% solution of sucrose in PSW.\nAdd 500 µL of 25% sucrose in PSW to a microcentrifuge tube with a snap cap.\nPrepare 3 microcentrifuge tubes with snap caps with 1 mL of PSW in each tube for washing the cells after sucrose treatment.\nCollect 30 - 60 Stentor cells in 1 mL of their culture media into a separate microcentrifuge tube using a 1 mL pipette (Figure 4, arrow A).\nCollect all the cells from the tube in 125 µL final volume using a 200 µL pipette in a single draw. Transfer them to the tube with 500 µL of 25% sucrose (prepared in Step 3.1.2) to obtain 625 µL of 20% sucrose solution (Figure 4, arrow B). Start a stopwatch.\nIncubate Stentor in this 20% sucrose solution and flick-spin the microcentrifuge tube in the rack for 1 min.\nCollect all the cells in a single draw (adjust the pipette to 200 µL max capacity for easier collection).\nKeep the cells in the pipette tip until the stopwatch shows 2 min of sucrose treatment.\nEject Stentor into one of the microcentrifuge tubes prepared in Step 3.1.3 (Figure 4, arrow C). Flick-spin the tube in the rack.",
    "Wash the cells two more times, once in each of the two remaining microcentrifuge tubes containing PSW prepared in Step 3.1.3 (Figure 4, arrows D and E).\n\t\tNote: Single draw cell collection technique is not important in between the washes.\nProceed to Section 4 of the protocol for details on imaging and interpretation of Stentor regeneration dynamics (Figure 4, arrows F and G).\nMembranellar band and oral apparatus removal using urea\n\t\nPrepare a solution of 4% urea in PSW.\nAdd 300 µL of 4% urea in PSW to a microcentrifuge tube with a snap cap.\nPrepare 3 microcentrifuge tubes with snap caps containing 1 mL of PSW in each tube for washing the cells after urea treatment.\nCollect 30 - 60 Stentor cells in 1 mL of their culture media into a separate microcentrifuge tube using a 1 mL pipette (Figure 4, arrow A).\nCollect all the cells from the tube in 300 µL final volume using a 1 mL pipette in a single draw. Transfer them to the tube with 300 µL of 4% urea (prepared in Step 3.2.2) to obtain 600 µL of 2% urea solution (Figure 4, arrow B). Start a stopwatch.\nIncubate Stentor in this 2% urea solution and flick-spin the microcentrifuge tube in the rack for 1 min.\nCollect all the cells in a single draw.\nKeep the cells in the pipette tip until the stopwatch shows 2 min of urea treatment.\nEject Stentor into one of the microcentrifuge tubes prepared in Step 3.2.3 (Figure 4, arrow C). Flick-spin the tube in the rack.\nWash the cells two more times, once in each of the two remaining microcentrifuge tubes containing PSW prepared in Step 3.2.3 (Figure 4, arrows D and E).\n\t\tNote: Single draw cell collection technique is not important in between the washes.",
    "Proceed to Section 4 of the protocol for details on imaging and interpretation of Stentor regeneration dynamics (Figure 4, arrows F and G).\n4. Imaging and Analyzing Cell Regeneration\nIf using an upright microscope, use the hanging droplet method to image regeneration of individual cells.\n\t\nPut 100 µL of PSW in a well of a glass spot plate.\nIsolate 1 Stentor cell in 4 µL of culture media (the media that they are in), using a 10 or 20 µL pipette. Deposit the droplet in the middle of a 22 x 22 mm2 coverslip (Figure 5).\n\t\tNote: If the cells that are 1) unhealthy (abnormally shaped or heavily vacuolated) or 2) still have membranellar bands or oral apparatuses (for chemical treatment experiments), do not use for imaging.\nArrange 4 more droplets of Stentor in the culture media around the previous droplet, while leaving enough space between the droplets.\nInvert the coverslip with droplets and gently place it over the well of the glass spot plate to which PSW was added in Step 4.1.\nNote: PSW in the well will minimize the evaporation of the droplets (Figure 5).\nPrepare the remaining cells for imaging by following Steps 4.1.1 - 4.1.4.\nImage the regenerating cells under a microscope with the desired time resolution. Alternatively, observe the regeneration using a dissecting stereo microscope.\n\t\tNote: Regeneration will begin immediately after cell cutting or treatment with sucrose or urea. However, visible new oral structures will form about 3 h after the beginning of regeneration.\nFor each time point, assign one of the three regeneration stages to each of the cells. To do this, compare each cell to the representative images illustrating the stages (Figure 4 and Figure 6).\n\t\nAssign Stage 1 to the cells that do not have a membranellar band yet (Figure 6A).",
    "Assign Stage 2 to the cells with a membranellar band.\n\t\tNote: A membranellar band appears 3 - 6 h after treatment (Figure 4, Figure 6B). At the very end of this stage, an additional curvature of the posterior end of the membranellar band will appear just before an oral primordium appears.\nAssign Stage 3 to the cells with an oral primordium.\n\t\tNote: An oral primordium is an invagination appearing 6 - 8 h after treatment at the posterior end of the membranellar band (Figure 4, Figure 6C and 6D). Regeneration is completed when the cells have a membranellar band at their anterior end and the characteristic trumpet cell shape (Figure 4, Figure 6E). Most Stentor cells are fully regenerated within 8-9 h since the start of regeneration.\nPlot the percentage of cells in each of the regeneration stages for each time point in the form of a stacked box plot (Figure 7).\n\tNote: This type of plot allows the visualization of regeneration dynamics in a population of cells."
