    "1. Assembly of the Strike Device (Figure 1)\nRemove the plunger from a 1 mL tuberculin syringe. Cut the barrel at the 1 mL mark.\nRemove an aerosol barrier (3 mm height x 4 mm diameter) from a 200 µL pipette tip and use it as an impactor. Place the impactor inside the syringe barrel. Gently tap the barrel to move the impactor to the tip end, with the flat side covering the nozzle opening.\nAttach the barrel tip end to plastic tubing that is connected to the carbon dioxide (CO2) flow regulator of a Drosophila anesthesia station.\nHold the barrel vertically and clamp it to a standard clamp holder stand so that the impactor stays at the bottom of the barrel.\nModify a 200 µL pipette tip to make the fly holder.\n\t\nCut 4 mm from the tip to make a 0.8 mm-diameter opening, allowing only the fly head to be exposed.\n\t\tNOTE: The thorax and all the other parts of the fly body will stay inside the pipette tip.\nModify a 1,000 µL pipette tip and a 1 mL syringe needle cap to make the connector.\n\t\nCut off 44 mm from the opening of the tip. Take a 6 mm length of a 1 mL syringe needle cap and push it tightly into the remaining segment of the 1,000 µL pipette tip.\n2. Operation of the Strike Device\nAnesthetize a single 2-day-old adult female fly using CO2 on a fly pad.\nGently transfer it to the fly holder using a fine brush. Tap the holder gently so that the fly head is seen outside of the tip end. If the fly proboscis is exposed outside the tip, gently tuck it back inside the tip with a blunted 1 mL syringe needle.",
    "NOTE: Make sure to keep the fly proboscis inside the holder. Otherwise, the fly may die from a sucking proboscis injury.\nTighten the fly holder to the syringe barrel with the connector so that the fly head is facing downwards.\nSet the gas pressure at 100 kPa. Adjust the flow rate according to the experiment design.\nQuickly turn the flow regulator toggle switch on and off so that the impactor strikes the fly head once.\nLift the fly holder and move it over a fly pad. Reverse the fly holder and gently tap the side to let the fly out. Leave the fly in an empty vial to recover.\n3. Video-assisted Movement Tracking\nFill a 6-cm-diameter Petri dish with transparent silicon elastomer to make the tracking arena. Leave a 3 mm space between the silicon and the dish lid to allow the flies to walk freely but not fly.\nAnesthetize four flies from either the sham or treated group each time and place them in the arena. Leave the flies at 22 °C for 1 h.\nPosition a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) camera above the arenas and record for 5 min.\nAnalyze the recorded movement trajectories using Ctrax software (freely available from Caltech)16. Export the tracked data in a programming language (e.g., Matlab)-compatible format and analyze the data based on distance traveled per frame17. Calculate the mean walking distance for each fly and combine it with all other recorded flies/group to obtain a mean cumulative distance travelled by the population of files in the same group.\nSubscription Required.
