    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nLentiviral transduction of cancer cells\nTiming: 1 week\nThis protocol is aimed at the lentiviral transduction of CRC cells for the stable expression of Wnt-reporter gene.\nCell plating.\nCollect cells at single-cell level by trypsinization (or by exposing them to Accutase).\nNote: This protocol can be applied to both commercial CRC cell lines (grown in adhesion) and primary isolated CRC cells (grown in suspension as spheroids, in ultra-low adhesion plastic) (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Commonly commercially available CRC cell lines that have already been efficiently transduced with TOP-GFP reporter plasmids include DLD-1, HT-29 and HCT-116 (Vermeulen et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1106-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Transduction of CRC cells with Wnt reporter construct\nFluorescence analysis of lentiviral transduction efficiency in CRC spheroids (grown in suspension) and HCT-116 CRC cells (grown in adhesion). Scale bar, 400 μm.\nCount viable cells by using Trypan blue and plate 500,000 cells in a well of a 6 well plate (adhesion or ultra-low adhesion, depending on the cell type) with 2 mL of cell culture medium supplemented with 8 μg/mL of Polybrene (to increase the lentiviral transduction efficiency).\nCritical: a prolonged exposure to polybrene could affect cell viability. Before proceeding with lentiviral transduction of cells it would be useful to assess the sensitivity of the cells to polybrene in terms of concentration and exposure time to set the best transduction condition.\nLentiviral transduction.\nAdd lentiviral particles, diluted or concentrated (MOI of 10-100), to the cells and mix gently.\nNote: The optimal multiplicity of infection (MOI) for each cell line to be stable transduced should be previously assessed to obtain the best balance between transduction efficiency and cell viability (https://www.genecopoeia.com/resource/lentivirus-thats-my-moi-and-im-sticking-to-it-lentivirus-moi-cell-lines/[href=https://www.genecopoeia.com/resource/lentivirus-thats-my-moi-and-im-sticking-to-it-lentivirus-moi-cell-lines/]).\nIncubate the cells at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 24 h.",
    "After 24 h from lentiviral transduction, put the cells back in culture in fresh cell culture medium.\nEvaluation of lentiviral transduction.\nAfter 72 h from lentiviral transduction the cells should start expressing the constitutive RFP to be observed under a fluorescent microscope. On the other hand, the expression of GFP should be heterogeneous, with GFP−/+ cells, according to their Wnt pathway activity (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nAfter expansion of the transduced cells, it would be useful to evaluate the transduction efficiency by FACS, and eventually, enrich the cells for the RFP+ cell population (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) (see step #7 for Brilliant Violet 421 Annexin V staining, to discriminate alive cells within TOP-GFP cells).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1106-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Evaluation and sorting of transduced CRC cells\nGating strategy for the sorting of TOP-GFP RFP+ transduced CRC spheroids.\nPause point: Proceed with the following steps of the protocol. Alternatively, sorted RFP+ cells can be stored in liquid nitrogen for long storage (>1 year).\nNote: Typical transduction efficiency obtained using this protocol is around 75%–85%.\nCytotoxicity assay of cancer cells\nTiming: 2–5 days\nThis section describes a protocol for determining the cytotoxicity of certain treatment on cancer cell subpopulation with differential Wnt/β-catenin signaling based on TOP-GFP intensity. It is conventionally believed that CSC population, usually displaying high Wnt/ β-catenin activity, is more resistant to therapies(Di Franco et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Lenos et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Vermeulen et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). With the Wnt/ β-catenin signaling reporter TOP-GFP, CSC population that exhibit high TOP-GFP signal could be specifically screened in cytotoxicity assessment. Consequently, this protocol allows researchers to distinguishably assess the efficiency of the treatment on cancer stem cell or more differentiated population, by FACS, analyzing the induction of cell death (using a dye compatible with GFP and mCherry-RFP) in GFPhigh (Wnthigh-CSCs) versus GFPlow-neg (Wntlow-neg-progenitor/differentiated) CRC cells.\nPlate Cells.",
    "Harvest RFP+-sorted TOP-GFP transduced cells by trypsinization. Mechanically open the cell clumps by pipetting up and down with harsh pressure if cells grow in sphere or island.\nCritical: When pelleting the treated cells growing in adhesion cell culture conditions, for Brilliant Violet 421 Annexin V staining, make sure to collect the supernatant and pool it together with the cell suspension after the trypsinization. The less viable cell population would detach and float up after treatment. To avoid losing this population and bringing in artificial bias in calculation of apoptotic percentage, floating cells should be collected as well as attached ones. Additionally, high speed (no more than 500 g) should be used to spin and pellet in order to ensure that the less viable cells are properly pelleted.\nCount the living cells with Trypan Blue exclusion and seed 50,000 cells per well, in a 24 well plate. Treatment conditions could be set up in duplicate or triplicate according to experiment design.\nCulture cells at 37°C, 5% CO2 overnight (8–16 h) before treatment. Proceed to next step if cells grow in suspension.\nTreatment.\nDilute drugs and prepare solvent control.\nAdd the diluted drugs or solvent control in a dropwise manner.\nCulture the cells for different time, according to time point setting.\nNote: Before to perform a flow cytometry analysis of cell viability in Wnt+ versus Wnt- cells, it would be useful to perform a dose-response curve of cancer cells to 5-FU+Oxaliplatin chemotherapy (or any other treatment), to select the best option in terms of drug concentration and time point to perform the analysis (or the following sorting of cells spared by the treatment) (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nCollect and pellet the treated cells.\nCollect the supernatant in 15 mL polypropylene centrifuge tube. Label the tubes properly.",
    "Trypsinize and collect the cells in the corresponding tubes. Dissociate the clumps by pipetting up and down with harsh pressure if cells grow in sphere or island, in order to obtain a single-cell suspension.\nSpin at 750 g for 4 min and pellet the cells.\nNote: Untreated cells, and cells treated with high concentration of drugs (previously determined by the IC50 study), could be used as Annexin V staining negative and positive controls, respectively.\nLabel the cells with Brilliant Violet 421 Annexin V.\nWash cells twice with the Staining Buffer (cat. #420201) and resuspend cells in Annexin V Binding Buffer (cat. # 422201) at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/mL (minimum volume 100 μL)\nTransfer 100 μL of cell suspension in a Falcon 5 mL Round Bottom High Clarity PP tube and add 5 μL of Brilliant Violet 421 Annexin V.\nNote: When working with the fluorescent substrate, keep it always in the dark as it is light sensitive.\nGently vortex the cells, and incubate them for 15 min at R.T., in the dark.\nAdd 400 μL of Annexin V Binding Buffer (cat. # 422201) to each tube. Analyze by flow cytometry.\nFilter the cells through a 70 μm cell strainer, to avoid the formation of cell clumps.\nNote: The use of a 40 μm cell strainer is highly recommended to avoid collection of cell doublets, or when working with sticky cells, to further prevent the formation of cell clumps.\nMeasure the fluorescence of Brilliant Violet 421 Annexin V by Flow Cytometry.\nStart up BD FACSMelody cell sorter (for detailed instruction visit: https://www.bdbiosciences.com/content/dam/bdb/marketing-documents/BD-FACSMelody-FACSChorus-Quick-Reference-Guide.pdf[href=https://www.bdbiosciences.com/content/dam/bdb/marketing-documents/BD-FACSMelody-FACSChorus-Quick-Reference-Guide.pdf]).\nRun daily fluidics startup.\nOptional: perform the flow cell clean.\nInstall the sort nozzle.\nRun Cytometer Setup and Drop Delay",
    "Prepare a tube of B&D CS&T RUO beads by mixing 500 μL of PBS + 2 drops of beads.\nVortex the mix of beads for at least 20 s before loading the tube and performing the Optical configuration.\nPrepare a tube of Accudrop beads by mixing 500 μL of PBS + 1 drop of beads.\nVortex the mix of beads for at least 20 s before loading the tube and performing the drop delay.\nCreate protocol by setting forward scatter (FSC), side scatter (SSC), FITC, PE and Brilliant Violet421 Channels for measurement, for an appropriate gating strategy (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1106-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Cytotoxicity assay\nGating strategy for the analysis of cytotoxicity in TOP-GFP transduced CRC spheroids. Small inset represents the untransduced CRC cells, used as GFP/RFP negative control.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1106-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Evaluation of cell death induction in Wnt+/- CRC cells\nAnalysis of cytotoxic effects in CSCs vs differentiated cancer cells in TOP-GFP transduced CRC spheroids.\nNote: Given the heterogeneous activation of Wnt pathway in CRC cells, it is always required the analysis of untransduced cells, as Wnt negative control (see small inset in the third panel of Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). This will lead to a correct discrimination of Wntneg versus Wntpos (high and low, defined as ∼10% highest versus ∼10% lowest positivity) CRC cells.\nRun and record the experiment (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nExport FCS files for data plotting and analysis.\nData analysis on FlowJo software.\nCell sorting + extreme limiting dilution analysis (ELDA)\nTiming: 3–4 hours (cell sorting) + 3–4 weeks (ELDA)\nThis section describes how to perform the isolation of specific CRC cell population (CSCs vs progenitor/differentiated cells) for downstream in vitro extreme limiting dilution assay (ELDA), in naïve cells, or following a specific anti-tumor treatment.\nHarvest cells",
    "Trypsinize and collect the cells in the corresponding tubes. Disassociate the clumps by pipetting up and down with harsh pressure if cells grow in spheres or islands.\nLabel the cells with Brilliant Violet 421 Annexin V.\nFilter the cells through a 70 μm cell strainer, to avoid the formation of cell clumps.\nCritical: To obtain reproducible results in terms of clonogenic potential of cancer cells it is crucial to not introduce any variation from cell collection to cell sorting. Be aware that the cell culture conditions must be maintained the same for all the replicates (starting cell viability of the cells, number of plated cells to be treated, volume of medium and time of treatment), as well as the sample storage conditions between cell collection and cell sorting. In this case, it is preferable to keep the samples at room temperature in a mix 1:1 of cell culture medium: PBS, 2% FBS, 1 mM EDTA. FBS should be heat-inactivated before use by heating it for 30 minutes at 56°C with mixing, to inactivate complement proteins. It is crucial not to keep the sample for too long in the tubes, while waiting for the sorting. For this reason, it is suggested to prepare each sample in slightly advance compared to the scheduled time of the sorting.\nStart up BD FACSMelody cell sorter (see point #9 for detailed information).\nLoad a previously saved experiment layout or create a new one.\nLoad the tube of cells that need to be analyzed/sorted and create the appropriate gating strategy to analyze/sort the viable cells (SCC-A versus FSC-A: cells; FSC-H versus FSC-A: single cells; BV421 versus FSC-A: alive cells) (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nIn the “Set up” sort tab, select the format (plate), the volume and the sort mode (single cells).\nLimited dilution sorting and cell plating.",
    "Prepare 96 well plates. Add 200 μL of complete culture medium in each well.\nChange the recipient stand to 96 well plate holder.\nPlan the 96 well plate as shown in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]. Number in each well of the table indicates the cell number to be seeded.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1106-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Setup of FACS-based limiting dilution assay\n96 well plate ELDA layout for the sorting of CRC cells to test their clonogenic potential. (Right panel) Phase contrast analysis of non clonogenic cell versus positive clonogenic outgrowth of CRC cells growing in suspension, 7 days after cell sorting. Scale bar, 20 μm.\nNote: When working with a highly clonogenic cell population, the setup of the 96 well plate can be changed by plating only single cells in all the wells of the plate, to better define their clonogenic potential. In this scenario, given the variable efficiency of the cell sorter (≥60 % in the best sorting conditions), it is preferable to use the U-Shaped-Bottom 96-well plate, as to do so you will be able, just few minutes after the sorting, to check every single well, in order to identify the well containing a single cell. Indeed, using the U-Shaped-Bottom microplate, the sorted cells will fast seed into the center of the wells, making it easy for their microscope observation.\nStart the sorting and record the events.\nCritical: During the sorting protocol, pay attention to the stability of the cell cloud to be sorted (sometimes it can be affected by oscillations in laser intensity or fluidics change), which could lead to the isolation of an unwanted cell population. Be aware that even small variations in the room temperature where the instrument is located could affect the stability of the selected parameters.",
    "Place the 96 well plates back to incubator and culture it at 37°C for 2 weeks, or longer, according to the proliferation rate of each cell line.\nCount the number of wells in which tumor sphere(s) grows out (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1106-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Evaluation of CRC cells colony forming potential\nYellow wells represent those considered positive for the clonogenic outgrowth (acidification of the medium due to cell metabolic activity), while pink-colored wells represent the negative clonogenic potential ones (no growth of colonies, unaltered pH of the cell culture medium).\nNote: When determining the outgrowth rate of the clonogenic cells, only count the well in which tumor clones form instead of counting the colonies in the wells.\nCalculate the clonogenic potential by ELDA online tool (http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda/[href=http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda/]) (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1106-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. CRC cells clonogenic potential calculation\nComparison of clonogenicity of bulk versus TOP-GFPlow/high CRC cells. The confidence intervals for 1/ (stem cell frequency) are calculated by ELDA online tool (left panel) and the percentage of clonogenic cells are plotted (right panel)."
