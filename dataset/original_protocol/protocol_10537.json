    "ETHICS STATEMENT: All of the in vivo animal experiments described were performed according to an approved protocol and under the ethical guidelines of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n1. Synthesis of Tz-Bn-NOTA\nIn a small reaction vessel, dissolve 7 mg NH2-Bn-NOTA (1.25 x 10-2 mmol) in 600 µl NaHCO3 buffer (0.1 M, pH 8.1). Check the pH of the solution. If needed, adjust the pH of the solution to 8.1 using small aliquots of 0.1 M Na2CO3.\nAdd the NH2-Bn-NOTA solution to 0.5 mg Tz-NHS (1.25 x 10-3 mmol) in a 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tube.\nNOTE: The Tz-NHS can either be weighed out dry or added from a stock solution of dry DMF or DMSO (< 50 µl).\nAllow the resulting reaction solution to react for 30 min at RT with mild agitation.\nAfter 30 min, purify the product using reversed-phase C18 HPLC chromatography to remove unreacted NH2-Bn-NOTA. The NH2-Bn-NOTA can be monitored at a wavelength of 254 nm, while the Tz-NHS and Tz-Bn-NOTA are best monitored at a wavelength of 525 nm.\nNOTE: Retention times are obviously highly dependent on the HPLC equipment setup of each laboratory (pumps, columns, tubing, etc.). However, to present an example, if a gradient of 0:100 MeCN/H2O (both with 0.1% TFA) to 100:0 MeCN/H2O over 25 min and an analytical 4.6 x 250 mm C18 column is used, the retention times of Tz-Bn-NOTA, Tz-NHS, and NH2-Bn-NOTA will be around 15 min, 16.5 min, and 10 min, respectively. The product can be purified from the other reaction components in either a single run or multiple runs using a semi-preparative or preparative C18 HPLC column. 1H-NMR, analytical HPLC, and ESI-MS are all methods that can be used to verify the purity of the completed Tz-Bn-NOTA precursor.11",
    "Freeze the collected HPLC eluent using liquid nitrogen.\nWrap the frozen collection tube in opaque aluminum foil.\nPlace the frozen collection tube in a lyophilizing vessel O/N to remove the HPLC mobile phase.\nStore the purified product (a bright pink solid) in the dark at -80 °C.\nNOTE: This is an acceptable stopping point in the procedure. The completed Tz-Bn-NOTA precursor is stable for at least 1 year under these conditions.\n2. Preparation of huA33-TCO Immunoconjugate\nIn a 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tube, prepare a 1 mg/ml (2.7 mM) solution of TCO-NHS in dry DMF.\nIn a 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tube, prepare a 2 mg/ml (13.3 µM) solution of huA33 in 1 ml of phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4 (0.01 M PO43-, 0.154 M NaCl).\nUsing small aliquots (< 5 µl) of 0.1 M Na2CO3, adjust the pH of the antibody solution to 8.8-9.0. Use either pH paper or a pH meter with a microelectrode to monitor the pH, and be careful not to allow the pH to rise above pH 9.0.\nOnce the antibody solution is at the correct pH, add a volume of the TCO-NHS solution corresponding to 8 molar equivalents of the activated ester. For example, add 7.9 µl of the 1 mg/ml TCO-NHS solution (1.07 x 10-7 mol TCO-NHS) to the 1 ml of 2 mg/ml huA33 antibody solution (1.33 x 10-8 mol huA33). Do not exceed 5% DMF by volume in the solution.\nGently mix the solution by inverting the microcentrifuge tube several times.\nWrap the microcentrifuge tube in opaque aluminum foil.\nAllow the solution to incubate for 1 hr at RT with mild agitation.",
    "After 1 hr at RT, purify the resulting immunoconjugate using a pre-packed disposable size exclusion desalting column. First, rinse the size exclusion column as described by the supplier to remove any preservatives present on the column during storage. Then, add the reaction mixture to the size exclusion column, rinse the column with 1.5 ml 0.9% sterile saline, and subsequently collect the product using 2 ml of 0.9% sterile saline as the eluent.\n\tNOTE: This step will yield the completed huA33-TCO as a 2 ml solution.\nMeasure the concentration of the resultant huA33-TCO on a UV-Vis spectrophotometer.\nIf a higher concentration is desired, concentrate the huA33-TCO solution using a centrifugal filter unit with a 50,000 molecular weight cut-off.\n\tNOTE: It is important to note that while huA33 and a variety of other well-known antibodies (e.g., bevacizumab, trastuzumab, cetuximab, and J591) are very tolerant of being concentrated, aggregation and precipitation can occur upon concentration in other cases. Researchers attempting this procedure with a new antibody should trust the literature or their own knowledge of the antibody in question with regard to whether or not to concentrate the antibody.\nStore the completed huA33-TCO immunoconjugate at 4 °C in the dark.\n\tNOTE: This is an acceptable stopping point in the procedure. The completed mAb-TCO conjugate should be stable for at least 3 months under these storage conditions.\n3. 64Cu Radiolabeling of Tz-Bn-NOTA\nNOTE: This step of the protocol involves the handling and manipulation of radioactivity. Before performing these steps — or performing any other work with radioactivity — researchers should consult with their home institution’s Radiation Safety Department. Take all possible steps to minimize exposure to ionizing radiation.\nIn a 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tube, prepare a 0.5 mg/ml (723 µM) solution of Tz-Bn-NOTA.",
    "In a 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tube, add 10 µl of the Tz-Bn-NOTA solution (5 µg) to 400 µl of 0.2 M NH4OAc pH 5.5 buffer. \nIn the interest of proper radiochemical note-keeping, measure and record the amount of radioactivity in the sample using a dose calibrator before and after the ensuing steps in the protocol below (3.4-3.8). This will help with the accurate determination of radiochemical yields.\nAdd 2,000 µCi (74 MBq) of 64Cu to the Tz-Bn-NOTA solution.\n\tNOTE: Typically, [64Cu]CuCl2 is supplied in a small volume (< 30 µl) of 0.1 N HCl, and thus only small volumes (< 10 µl) of this stock solution are needed for the radiolabeling reaction. If larger volumes of the [64Cu]CuCl2 stock are needed, the radiolabeling reaction is tolerant of increasing the overall reaction volume. However, the pH of the radiolabeling reaction solution should be monitored carefully to ensure that it does not fall below pH 4.0.\nAllow the solution to incubate for 10 min at RT with mild agitation.\nAfter 10 min of incubation, purify the product using reversed-phase C18 HPLC chromatography. Retention times are obviously highly dependent on the HPLC equipment setup of each laboratory (pumps, columns, tubing, etc.). However, to present an example, if a gradient of 5:95 MeCN/H2O (both with 0.1% TFA) to 95:5 MeCN/H2O over 15 min is used, the retention time of 64Cu-Tz-Bn-NOTA should be around 9.8 min while free, uncomplexed 64Cu will elute with the solvent front at around 2-4 min.\nUsing a rotary evaporator, remove the HPLC eluent.\nRedissolve the 64Cu-Tz-Bn-NOTA product in 0.9% sterile saline.",
    "NOTE: Given the 12.7 hr physical half-life of 64Cu, this is not an acceptable stopping point in the procedure. Perform the synthesis of 64Cu-Tz-Bn-NOTA immediately prior to the injection of the radioligand, and follow Step 3.7 immediately by Step 4.5.\n4. In Vivo Pretargeted PET Imaging\nNOTE: As in Protocol Section 3, this step of the protocol involves the handling and manipulation of radioactivity. Before performing these steps researchers should consult with their home institution’s Radiation Safety Department. Take all possible steps to minimize exposure to ionizing radiation.\nIn a female athymic nude mouse, subcutaneously implant 1 x 106 SW1222 colorectal cancer cells and allow these to grow into a 100-150 mm3 xenograft (9-12 days after inoculation).11\nDilute an aliquot of the huA33-TCO solution from Protocol Section 2 to a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in 0.9% sterile saline.\nInject 200 µl of the huA33-TCO solution (100 µg) into the tail vein of the xenograft-bearing mouse.\nAllow 24 hr for the accumulation of the huA33-TCO in the tumor of the mouse.\nDilute the 64Cu-Tz-Bn-NOTA radioligand to a concentration of 1.5 mCi/ml in 0.9% sterile saline.\nInject 200 µl of the 64Cu-Tz-Bn-NOTA radioligand solution (300 µCi; 11.1 MBq; 1.6 nmol of 64Cu-Tz-Bn-NOTA, assuming a specific activity of 6.7 MBq/nmol) into the tail vein of the xenograft-bearing mice.\nAt the desired imaging time point (e.g., 2, 6, 12, or 24 hr post-injection), anesthetize the mouse with a 2% isoflurane:oxygen gas mixture.\nPlace the mouse on the bed of the small animal PET scanner. Maintain anesthesia during the scan using a 1% isoflurane:oxygen gas mixture. Prior to placing the animal on the scanner bed, verify anesthesia using the toe-pinch method and apply veterinary ointment to the eyes of the mouse to prevent drying during anesthesia.",
    "Acquire the PET data for the mouse via a static scan with a minimum of 20 million coincident events using an energy window of 350-700 keV and a coincidence timing window of 6 nsec. After completing the acquisition of the image, do not leave the mouse unattended and do not place it in a cage with other mice until it has regained consciousness.\nSubscription Required.
