    "Day 1:\n1. Transient Transfection of Endothelial Cells\nIf desired, perform a transient transfection of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) using gene-regulatory oligonucleotides (e.g. micro-RNAs or small interfering RNA (siRNA)) and the appropriate lipofectamine reagent according to manufacturer's instructions.\n\tNOTE: This protocol has had great success performing reverse transfections with custom siRNA sequences and a commercial transfection reagent (See Materials Table). The authors have not tested other transfection protocols and reagents with this assay. The steps for the reverse transfection using the reagents listed are as follows:\nReconstitute lyophilized siRNAs or microRNAs at a concentration of 20 µM in nuclease free water.\nMake transfection solutions at the following ratio: 1 mL of any serum free media with 9 µL of siRNA or microRNA.\nAgitate the solution and allow it to incubate for 5 min at room temperature.\nAdd 18 µL of transfection reagent to the solution and agitate.\nAllow the solution to incubate at room temperature for 20-40 min, agitating the solution every 10 to 15 min for the duration of the incubation.\nWhile the transfection solution is incubating, detach HUVEC using a cell detachment solution (e.g., Accutase). For a T175 flask, wash the flask with 10 mL of Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS), and then add 5 mL of cell detachment solution and incubate the flask at 37 °C for 10 min.\nAdd 5 mL of complete media to the T175 flask, remove the cell suspension from the flask and centrifuge at 1200 rpm for 3 min.\nRemove the supernatant using a vacuum aspirator and resuspend the cell pellet at a density of 1 X 106 cells per mL in EGM2.\n\tNOTE: This protocol has had great success using Endothelial Cell Growth Medium (EGM2) containing the standard growth factor bullet kit as well as an additional 10% FBS.",
    "Once the transfection solution has finished incubating, plate 1 mL of solution in a 10-cm plate, and add 1 mL of HUVEC suspension on top.\nAdd an additional 7 mL of complete media to bring the final volume in the 10-cm plate to 9 mL.\nMake up at least two 10 cm plates worth of cells for each transfection condition to ensure that there are enough cells available for later steps in the assay.\n\tNOTE: These conditions result in a final working concentration of gene regulatory oligonucleotide of 20 nM. The authors have found these conditions to result in a 60-80% knockdown of gene expression for their targets of interest. Other researchers may need to optimize transfection conditions according to their experimental needs.\nExchange the media 4-6 h post addition of siRNA complexes with fresh complete media.\n\tNOTE: This protocol was developed using passage 1 - 2 HUVEC.\nDay 2\n2. Coating of Microcarrier Beads with Endothelial Cells\nReconstitute microcarrier beads (e.g., Cytodex 3) at a concentration of 60,000 beads/mL in PBS and autoclave.\n\tNOTE: microcarrier beads come at a concentration of approximately 3 x 106 beads per gram. Reconstitute the beads at a ratio of 20 mg of beads per mL of PBS to get a bead density of approximately 60,000 beads/mL.\nAliquot 1 mL of complete media into the desired number of round-bottomed Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) tubes.\nPipette 20 µL of microcarrier bead suspension into each tube (take care to ensure that the bead solution is well resuspended prior to pipetting).",
    "NOTE: There will likely be dramatic variability in the final working concentration of beads present in a given microcarrier bead suspension. Beads can easily adhere to the sides of plastic and glass containers which can greatly alter bead concentration in the solution. The most appropriate volume of bead solution added to the FACS tube for each batch of microcarrier bead suspension will need to be determined empirically by the investigator. The numbers presented here are meant to serve more as a starting point. Ideally, conditions should be optimized so there are 10-20 beads embedded within the fibrin gel per well in the 24 well plate at the end of the assay. See further discussion in the discussion section below regarding optimization of beads numbers for the assay.\nDetach transfected HUVEC 24 h post transfection using the cell detachment solution as follows:\n\t\nWash each 10-cm plate of cells with 5 mL of PBS, and then add 2 mL of the cell detachment solution and incubate the cells at 37 °C for 10 min.\nResuspend the cells at a concentration of 1 X 106 cells/mL in complete media.\nAdd 1 mL of cell suspension (i.e. 1 X 106 HUVEC) to each FACS tube containing beads.\nGently agitate the FACS tubes every 20 min for the duration of 4 h at 37 °C (if proceeding to step 3.4) or 2.5 to 3 h (if proceeding to step 3.2).\n\tNOTE: This duration and frequency of agitation has been empirically determined by previous researchers who have optimized the basic bead sprouting assay.4  Other frequencies of agitation and durations of the bead coating step have not been tested by the authors.\n3. Sequential Coating of Pericytes on HUVEC-Coated Microcarrier Beads\nBegin detaching 10T1/2 cells (pericytes) using the cell detachment solution (trypsin) as follows:",
    "Wash a T175 flask with 10 mL of PBS, then add 5 mL of trypsin and incubate at 37 °C for 10 min.\nResuspend 10T1/2 at a concentration of 2 X 105 cells/0.5 mL in complete media.\n\t\tNOTE: Cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).\n\t\tNOTE: Culture 10T1/2 cells in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin Streptomycin.\nAfter 2.5 to 3 h of agitating the bead + HUVEC solution, wait 5 min to allow the beads and free-floating HUVEC to settle to the bottom of the tube.\nRemove 0.5 mL of complete media from each tube using a P1000 pipette and add 2 x 105 10T1/2 in complete media in a volume of 0.5 mL to each FACs tube. Agitate the cell and bead solution and then continue to incubate at 37 °C. Continue to agitate every 20 min until the beads have been agitated for a total of 4 h.\n\tNOTE: The ratio of 5 HUVEC: 1 pericyte on the beads is essential to maintain appropriate pericyte coverage of the vessels.\n\tNOTE: The following alternative steps can be followed instead at this point in the protocol:\nAgitate beads and HUVEC only for 4 h.\nOnce the 4 h of HUVEC coating of the microcarrier beads is complete, agitate the tubes one last time, wait 30-60 s, then immediately remove 1.5-1.75 mL of solution from the FACS tube.\n\tNOTE: This should allow enough time for most of the beads to settle while many free-floating HUVEC in the media will be removed.\n\t\nAdd 2 X 105 10T1/2 in complete media and bring the volume of the FACS tube up to 2 mL.\nGently agitate the FACS tubes every 20 min for an additional hour.",
    "Once the agitating is complete, gently agitate the tubes one last time and immediately remove the entire solution (2 mL), and add it to a 6-cm plate. Add an additional 3 mL of complete media to each plate and place the plates in the 37 °C incubator overnight.\nDay 3\n4. Preparation of Fibrin Gel Solutions\nPrepare working solutions of aprotinin at a concentration of 1 mg/mL in PBS and thrombin at 50 units/mL.\n\tNOTE: A large stock of each of these solutions can be made and stored at 4 °C for at least a year.\nMake a fresh solution of fibrinogen at a concentration of 2 mg/mL. Make enough solution to have 2.5 mL of solution per agitated FACS tube.\n\t\nWarm the solution in a 37 °C water bath for 10 min to allow all of the fibrinogen to go into solution.\nAdd 37.5 µL of aprotinin solution per 1 mL of fibrinogen solution.\nSterile-filter the solution and set aside at room temperature.\n5. Preparing Beads for Gel Implantation\nExamine the dishes containing the microcarrier-coated beads under the microscope using the 20X objective to ensure that all beads have been sufficiently coated by endothelial cells.\nVigorously pipette the plated solution of cells to detach them from the 6-cm plate and place the solution into a tube. Wash the plate 2X additional times with complete media and transfer to the tube to collect all residual beads that may be adhered to the plate.\n\t\nAvoid introducing air bubbles and use a p1000 pipette to minimize shear stress on the endothelial cell-coated beads.",
    "If assessing siRNA knockdown efficiency in the endothelial cells is needed, in step 2, be sure to have a plate of HUVEC-only coated beads. Then during this step (5.2), detach the beads and collect the residual HUVEC attached to the plate for RNA isolation and qPCR analysis.\nWait 3 min to allow the beads in the solution to settle to the bottom of the tube.\nRemove as much of the supernatant as possible without disturbing the bead pellet using a p1000 pipette tip (do not use a vacuum aspirator).\nAdd 1 mL of complete media to each tube and resuspend the beads.\nWait 30-60 s to allow the beads to settle to the bottom. Then remove as much of the supernatant as possible using a P1000 pipette without disturbing the bead pellet. Do not use a vacuum aspirator as the likelihood of accidentally removing the bead pellet is greatly increased.\nRepeat Steps 5.5 and 5.6 two additional times. The goal is to remove as much of the free-floating HUVEC that may have been detached from the 6-cm plate as possible, while not removing too many HUVEC-coated beads, which should settle in the FACS tube more quickly than free-floating cells.\nAdd 1 mL of complete media to the beads.\n6. Embedding Coated Beads in a Fibrin Gel\nRemove as much media as possible without disturbing the bead pellet in each FACS tube using a P1000 pipette.\nResuspend the beads in 2.5 mL of fibrinogen solution.\nPipette 13 µL of thrombin solution into each desired well of a 24-well glass-bottomed plate. Plating in a glass-bottomed plate is essential for enabling optimal imaging of the sprouts.\n\tNOTE: Do not leave thrombin sitting in a well for more than 5-10 min before the next step.\nAdd 0.5 mL of bead/fibrinogen solution to each well.",
    "Be sure to resuspend the bead solution well prior to pipetting the solution each time.\nTake caution to carefully pipette directly into the thrombin already present in the well. Slowly pipette up and down 2-3 times to thoroughly mix the solution, taking caution to not introduce any air bubbles.\nBe sure to change the pipette tip between wells.\nTake caution to not move or disturb the plate at any point during initial fibrin clotting, as any movement may disrupt the gel formation.\nLeave the plate sitting in the hood for 30 min at room temperature.\nCarefully transfer the plate to a 37 °C incubator for an additional 1.5-2 h to allow the gel to fully solidify\n7. Plating Fibroblasts on Top of the Fibrin Gel\nDuring the last 30 min of the gel solidifying, detach Normal Human Lung Fibroblasts (NHLF) as follows:\n\t\nWash a T175 flask of cells with 10 mL of PBS, then add 5 mL of cell detachment solution and incubate at 37 °C for 10 min.\nResuspend NHLF at a concentration of 20,000 cells/mL in complete media.\n\t\tNOTE: NHLF cells can be cultured with Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin Streptomycin.\nPlate 1 mL of the NHLF cell suspension onto the gel of each well and place back in the incubator.\nChange complete media every other day for the duration of the assay.\n8. Observe sprouting over the course of 2-7 days following bead implantation in the fibrin gel. The length of time required for sprouting will depend on the passage and lot number of HUVEC.\n9. Fixation of Sprouting Assay\nOnce sufficient sprouting has occurred to be able to determine a phenotypic difference between treatment groups, wash all wells one time with 2 mL of PBS.",
    "Add 0.5 mL of cell detachment solution to each well and place the plate in a 37 °C incubator for 5 min.\nRemove the plate from the incubator and tap the sides of the plate.\n\tNOTE: The purpose of this step is to remove as many of the NHLF cells growing on top of the fibrin gel as possible to facilitate antibody penetration into the gel as well as imaging of the gel. The total incubation time with cell detachment solution may need to be adjusted to optimize NHLF removal. Researchers are cautioned to not incubate the gel for excessive periods of time as the cell detachment solution may penetrate into the gel and begin disrupting the endothelial structures within.\nOnce a sufficient amount of NHLF cells have been removed, quench the cell detachment solution with 1 mL of complete media.\nAspirate the detached NHLF and media using a vacuum aspirator, and wash the wells once with 1 mL of PBS.\nAdd 300 µL of 2% paraformaldehyde solution in PBS to each well and incubate at room temperature for 10 min.\nRemove the 2% paraformaldehyde solution and wash each well 3 times with 1 mL of PBS for 3 min at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: Please dispose of 2% paraformaldehyde solution appropriately in accordance with Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) guidelines.\n\t\nAdd 1 mL of PBS to each well and store at 4 °C until ready to stain or image the sprouts.\n10. Staining of Sprouting Assay\nAdd 300 µL of 0.5% Triton-X 100 in PBS to each well and incubate for 30 to 45 min at room temperature.\nUsing a vacuum aspirator, remove Triton-X100 and wash 3 times in PBS for 5 min each.\nAdd 500 µL of blocking solution to each gel and incubate overnight at 4 °C.",
    "NOTE: The blocking solution is made up of the following components: 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 5% FBS, 0.1% tween-20, and 1% antiserum (use the same species from which your secondary antibodies are derived) in PBS.\nRemove blocking solution from each well and add 300 µL of staining solution containing primary antibody to each well.\n\tNOTE: The staining solution is the same as the blocking solution, but without the antiserum present. The authors have had success incubating with primary antibodies at dilutions of 1:200 to 1:400.\nIncubate primary antibodies in staining solution for 24 h at 4 °C.\nAspirate primary antibody solution and wash 3 times in TBS with 0.5% tween for 20 min each at room temperature with gentle rocking. After the third wash, replace with fresh wash buffer again, and store at 4 °C overnight.\nIncubate with fluorescent secondary antibody diluted 1:1000 in staining solution for 2 h at room temperature.\nRemove secondary antibody staining solution and wash 5 times for 20 min each with TBS containing 0.5% tween at room temperature with gentle rocking.\nDilute nuclear stain in PBS and incubate overnight at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: This protocol has had great success with Hoechst diluted 1:10000 in PBS.\n\tNOTE: There is no need to remove nuclear staining solution prior to imaging.\nImage within a few days of completing the staining to capture optimal fluorescent signal.\n11. Sprouting Assay Quantification\nAfter the sprouts have been imaged, import the image files into ImageJ and use the Count tool to count the number of sprouts, or the Line tool to measure sprout lengths.",
    "NOTE: Sprouts are defined as endothelial protrusions with a length greater than or equal to the diameter of the bead from which they are sprouting.11 Sprout length can be measured as the distance from the point at which the sprout begins protruding off of the bead to the tip of the sprout. Average sprout length per bead and average number of sprouts per bead are useful metrics to assess phenotypic effects of gene silencing in sprouting angiogenesis. The average number of beads containing at least one sprout per treatment group can also be used as a metric to assess the robustness of sprouting.\nSubscription Required.
