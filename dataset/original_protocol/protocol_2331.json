    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nFRAP Analysis of hTR Foci at Cajal Bodies\nTiming: Collecting sufficient cells may take several imaging sessions (of 3–4 h each), analysis may take several days\nBelow is a basic protocol for FRAP of hTR molecules at Cajal bodies.\nPlate cells on imaging plates (MatTek) the night before the experiment. In the morning, change media to a live-cell imaging mixture and allow cells to equilibrate for an hour or more.\nIn the meantime, turn on the stage-top incubator (Tokai Hit), allow the temperature to stabilize at 37°C, and fill the attached water bath with sterile ddH2O. Turn on CO2 gas as needed.\nWhile waiting, take images of TetraSpeck beads (Invitrogen) to use as a channel registration reference (see below).\nTake 20–30 flat field correction slide images (see below).\nAfter cells have equilibrated, move the dish to the stage-top incubator, attach the temperature probe and allow the media to come to 37°C.\nFocus on cells using brightfield channel, then switch to dual camera mode. We use a Nikon Ti2 Eclipse with a CSU-W1 confocal unit and a Brukker FRAP module. We image Cajal bodies (CBs) using mCherry-coilin (excitation 561 nm) and hTR (488 nm) using MCP-GFP. Dual camera mode (two Andor iXon Life 888 EMCCD cameras connected by a Cairn Dual Emission Image Splitter) allows simultaneous imaging of both structures and allows us to correct or exclude images for analysis in which the CB moves during acquisition. Single-camera images of the mCherry-coilin channel could also be used to define FRAP regions, but CBs are dynamic structures.",
    "Identify cells where strong hTR signal visibly colocalizes with CBs. These cells are somewhat rare. When searching for appropriate cells, do not use live camera mode as this leads to bleaching and phototoxicity, as well as inaccurate measurements. Use the lowest illumination possible and take single images using the snap shot function until a desired cell is located.\nDefine a 2 μm circle around the CB using the FRAP software (in our case, Nikon Elements) and bleach using the Brukker galvo system. Some software setups allow imaging through the bleaching process or imaging strictly limited until after the bleach. We image after the bleach, which entails a short delay, which can be consequential for very fast recoveries. However, imaging the pulse can damage the camera, especially when EM gain is used. For bleaching, we use a 405 nm pulse at low laser power (5%) and with a pixel scan speed of 25 μs per pixel (in total 23.78 ms for a diameter 2 μm circle). The bleach should be sufficiently powerful to remove about 80% or more of the fluorescence before recovery.\nBleach and image for 1 min, with 600 ms intervals and 100 ms exposure time. Several pre-bleach images must be taken to determine the baseline fluorescence. We took five such images, at a rate of 1/s.\nTo test for phototoxicity, acquire images of the bleached and imaged cell in a transmitted light channel every 5 to 10 min as necessary. Gross morphological changes should not occur, particularly blebbing of membranes and fragmentation of the cell. This does not need to be repeated for every cell, but should be determined prior to a large-scale experiment.",
    "Critical: The total amount of images, laser power, and exposure time should be set to maximize SNR, minimize phototoxicity, and minimize acquisition photobleaching (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]). The intensity of a non-FRAP reference region in the cell should not decrease more than 20% of its initial intensity over the course of the imaging (see below). Phototoxicity should be minimized as much as possible (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nCollect cells as necessary for the experiment. A small-scale pilot experiment with the conditions of interest and a statistical power analysis (for the statistical test intended for the analysis) will guide the total number of cells necessary to identify changes in half-life and mobile fraction between those conditions. The estimated sample size of the full experiment may also be used to determine whether the FRAP protocol is time efficient.\nPhotoactivation of hTR at Cajal Bodies\nTiming: Collecting sufficient cells may take several imaging sessions (of 3–4 h each), analysis may take several days\nPhotoactivation is performed with several differences as detailed below. These experiments were performed on a different spinning disk setup than above. For photoactivation studies, a photoactivatable GFP variant is fused to the MS2 coat protein (MCP-paGFP). This protein increases 100-fold (Patterson and Lippincott-Schwartz, 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]) in fluorescence after a pulse with a 405 nm laser, and the decay of that fluorescence can be recorded over time as a measure of outward migration of labeled molecules from the CB.\nFor these experiments, cells expressing mCherry-coilin and MCP-paGFP are plated on glass-bottom 35 mm dishes (in this case, Fluorodish WPI) and placed in live-cell imaging media as above.",
    "Cells are imaged on a Zeiss Axio-Observer Z1 Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning disk inverted confocal microscope with a 37°C, 5% CO2 imaging chamber. The lasers (405 nm 50 mW OPSL, 488 nm 100 mW diode, and 561 nm 40 mW diode) should be on for a minimum of 1 h before imaging to stabilize. For photoactivation studies we image Cajal bodies (CBs) using mCherry-coilin (excitation 561 nm) and hTR (488 nm) using MCP-paGFP, sequentially on a single EMCCD camera (Photometrics Evolve 512).\nThe Cajal body defined with mCherry-coilin is positioned in the center of the field of view in Live mode so that it can be targeted by the centered 1.5 μm diameter target area of the Zeiss Direct-FRAP module.\nFive pre-bleach images of MCP-paGFP are acquired to establish the initial conditions. The exposure time used for MCP-paGFP is 150 ms with an added 30 ms camera transfer time resulting in a 180 ms interval between images. The 1.5 μm target area is exposed to the 405 nm laser (at 20% power) for 500 ms, and 195 images are then acquired to follow the MCP-paGFP signal for a total of 35 s. There is only a 20 ms delay between the end of the 405 nm pulse and the first post-photoactivation exposure. A representative photoactivation experiment is shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A."
