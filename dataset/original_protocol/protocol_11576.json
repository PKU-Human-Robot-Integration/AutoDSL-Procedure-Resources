    "All experimental protocols are approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of National Taiwan University.\n1. Stereotaxic Surgery for Implanting ECoG Electrodes, EMG Electrodes, Brain Thermistor, and Injection Guide Cannula\nFor rats (250 - 350 g, 6- to 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats)\nAnesthetize the rats by IP injection with 50 mg/kg zoletil. Confirm the proper depth of anesthesia by observing a lack of response after pinching the hind paw. Apply eye ointment, shave the fur, and sterilize the skin with povidone-iodine solution and 75% ethanol. Inject an antibiotic (penicillin G) to prevent infection.\nPrepare scalpels, scissors, hemostats, gauzes, and cautery machine for surgery. Sterilize surgical gear and gauzes by an autoclave and the cautery by 75% ethanol.\nPlace an ear bar into the ear canal and mount the rat to the stereotaxis.\nUsing a scalpel, make an approximate 2-cm midline incision on the skull along a line between two the ears, moving caudally. Clip the skin flaps with hemostats to expose the skull and remove the tissue over the skull using a scalpel.\nDrill eight holes (F1, F2, P1, P2, O1, O2, R1, and R2), each approximately 0.7 mm in diameter, on the skull with a rotary tool. Screw eight ECoG electrodes on the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes and the cerebellum in both the left and right hemispheres. These electrodes are used for focal epilepsy detection.\n\t\t\nUse the following coordinates for the recording electrodes: frontal (F1 and F2): +2.0 mm anterior to bregma and +2.5 mm from the midline, parietal (P1 and P2): -2.0 mm anterior to bregma and +3.0 mm from the midline, and occipital (O1 and O2): -5.5 mm anterior to bregma and +3.0 mm from the midline.",
    "Place two reference electrodes (R1 and R2) over the cerebellum (-11.0 mm anterior to bregma and +4.0 mm from the midline).\nIn a separate groups of rats, drill three holes and place two screw EEG electrodes over the right frontal (F2) and parietal lobes (P2) of the cortices with the same coordinates as described in step 1.1.5.1. Place a third EEG electrode over the left cerebellum (R1), which serves to ground the animal and reduce signal artifacts. These electrodes are used for confirming generalized epilepsy and analyzing vigilance stages.\nSeparate the neck skin and muscle and insert two EMG electrodes into the neck muscle.\nDrill another hole on the skull and place a microinjection guide cannula into the left CeA (AP, 2.8 mm from bregma; ML, 4.2 mm; DV, 7.8 mm relative to bregma) in rats. The coordinates are adapted from the Paxinos and Watson rat atlas10.\nDrill a bigger hole (with a diameter of 1.6 mm) on the skull and insert a calibrated 30-kV thermistor on the surface of the parietal cortex, which will be cemented later, to monitor the cortical temperature in rats.\nUse gauze and cautery to stop bleeding when it occurs.\nRoute the insulated leads from the ECoG electrodes and EMG electrodes to a pedestal and connect the thermistor to the tether. Cement the pedestal and guide cannula to the skull with dental acrylic.\nTreat the incision topically with polysporin (bacitracin zinc/polymyxin B sulfate) to prevent infection. Give the animals both ibuprofen and penicillin G in water for one week after surgery.\nFor mice (20 - 30 g, 6- to 8-week-old C57BL/C mice)",
    "Anesthetize the mice by IP injection with 50 mg/kg zoletil and confirm the proper depth of anesthesia by observing a lack of response after pinching the hind paw. Apply eye ointment. After shaving the fur, sterilize the skin with povidone-iodine solution and 75% ethanol. Inject an antibiotic (penicillin G) to prevent infection.\nPlace an ear bar into the ear canal and mount the mouse to the stereotaxis.\nUsing a scalpel, make an approximate 1.5-cm midline incision on the skull along a line between the two ears, moving caudally. Clip the skin flaps with hemostats to expose the skull and remove the tissue over the skull with a scalpel.\nPoke two holes on the skull with surgical scissors and place two wire ECoG electrodes on the right frontal lobe (F2: +2.0 mm to bregma and +1.5 to the midline) and left parietal lobe (P1: -3.0 mm to bregma and -2.5 mm to the midline).\nSeparate the neck skin and muscle and insert two EMG electrodes into the neck muscle.\nConnect the insulated leads from the wire ECoG electrodes and EMG electrodes to the female terminals and to a 2.54-mm connector, and then cement to the skull with dental acrylic.\nTreat the incision topically with polysporin (bacitracin zinc/polymyxin B sulfate) to prevent infection. Give the animals both ibuprofen and penicillin G in water for one week after surgery.\nAllow all animals to recover for seven days prior to the initiation of the experiments.\nHouse rats or mice separately, in individual recording cages, in the isolated room where the temperature is maintained at 23 ± 1 °C and the light:dark (L:D) rhythm is controlled in a 12:12-h cycle (40 W x 4 tubes illumination). Provide food and water ad libitum.",
    "Connect the ECoG, EMG, and thermistor through a tether to the amplifiers one week after surgery to start the recordings.\n2. Establishment of Focal TLE Epilepsy, SE, and Spontaneously Recurrent Epilepsy\nFor rats\nAdminister 0.5 µL of pilocarpine (2.4 mg/µL) into the left CeA through the injection guide cannula using a microinjection pump. The injection rate should be set at 0.2 µL/min to induce focal TLE.\nIP inject 300 mg/kg of pilocarpine to induce generalized epilepsy with recurrent SE.\nFor mice\nIP administer PTZ (0.035 mg/g mouse bodyweight) at a particular ZT point every other day. Five consecutive injections will cause the development of spontaneously and recurrently generalized epilepsy.\nFor both rats and mice\nAmplify the ECoG signals by 5,000 and filter the analog bandpass between 0.1 and 40 Hz.\nUse an A/D converting board to convert the analog ECoGs signals to digital signals with a 128-Hz sampling rate.\nUse a software for visual scoring and analyze the onset and the duration of epilepsy. Measure the time scale in order to represent the duration.\nDefine ECoG epilepsy by the appearance of epileptic spikes with amplitudes greater than 2 mV and with durations of more than 30 s13.\n3. Classification of Vigilance States\nFor rats\nDetermine the vigilance states by using the parameters acquired from ECoGs, EMG, brain temperatures, and locomotion within a 12-s episode of recording. Connect the ECoG, EMG, and thermistor through a tether to the amplifiers one week after surgery to start the recording. Score the states with a custom-made software according to steps 3.1.5 - 3.1.7.\nMeasure locomotor activities using an infrared motion detector, integrate the signals every 1 s, and store the signals.\nMeasure cortical temperature and store the signals.\nClassify vigilance states according to our previously defined criteria14.",
    "Score wakefulness by using the following characteristics: small-amplitude ECoGs with high-frequency spectra, higher delta power (0.5 - 4.0 Hz), and lower theta power (6.0 - 9.0 Hz); dominant locomotor activity; high EMG activity; and gradually increasing cortical temperature.\nScore NREM sleep by using the following characteristics: delta-wave dominant ECoGs with large amplitudes, declined EMG activity, reduced cortical temperature, and no locomotor activity.\nScore REM sleep by using the following characteristics: decreased amplitude of ECoGs with the dominant theta frequency, suddenly increased cortical temperature, minimal EMG activity, and low locomotor activity with body twitches.\nFor mice\nRepeat the classification of vigilance states in the mice as conducted in the rats, except there is no cortical temperature recorded from the thermistor.\n4. Performance of Manual Acupuncture and EA in Rats\nThe rat is anesthetized for the EA protocol. \nLocate the acupoint by anatomy and confirm low skin impedance at the acupoint. The light is flashing when detect the low skin impedance. Note: Fengchi acupoints are located 3 mm away from the posterior median line between the two ears, on the neck.\nInsert stainless-steel needles into the acupoints at a depth of 2 mm.\nTwitch the inserted needles 10 times every 5 min.\nUsing a functional electrical stimulator, deliver a train of biphasic pulses (150-µs duration each) with an intensity of 1 mA to the acupoints through the needle.\nPerform a sham acupuncture or sham EA as a control.\nSubscription Required.
