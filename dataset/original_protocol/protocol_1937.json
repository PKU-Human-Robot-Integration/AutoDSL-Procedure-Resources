Through dual inhibition of SMAD proteins (homologous to the gene products of the Drosophila gene “mothers against decapentaplegic” (Mad) and the C. elegans gene sma) this protocol results in a monolayer of neural progenitors with a robust expression profile that is critical for efficient cortical induction and subsequent neuronal differentiation. Two SMAD inhibitors are used: SB431542 and LDN (selective BMP signaling inhibitor). The former is a potent and specific inhibitor of transforming growth factor-β superfamily type I activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) receptors (Inman et al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]), while LDN is a derivative of Drosomorphin and also inhibits BMP type I receptors, preventing activation of downstream SMADs (Boergermann et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nBy day 11 pluripotency and stem-renewal markers (CDK6, NANOG and OCT4 genes) should decline dramatically, while markers of the primary cortical stem and progenitor cells (including NES, OTX2 and PAX6 genes) increase. Batches of differentiating cultures that achieve a homogenous layer of progenitor cells with these characteristics promote robust and reproducible differentiation experiments.\nNote: This protocol is an optimization from a previous protocol (Chambers et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nNote: Given the inherent variability of the differentiation, use an appropriate number of biological replications. Nonetheless, opportunities for expansion of differentiation cultures will be available in later steps.\nPlate cells at a high density (80,000 cells/cm2; Days -1 to 2 of the differentiation)\nOn Day -1 of the differentiation: coat 12-well plates with laminin-111 according to the manufacturer’s instructions (https://biolamina.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/instructions-bl001.pdf[href=https://biolamina.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/instructions-bl001.pdf].\nCritical: Plates must be freshly coated and the matrix of laminin-111 formed must be even and properly hydrated. Plates must be kept at 4°C and sterile. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]",
    "Note: If coating glass coverslips or glass bottom plates these need to be pre-treated with poly-L-ornithine, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/DK/en/product/sigma/p4957[href=https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/DK/en/product/sigma/p4957])\nNote: Control wells should be included for subsequent assessment of the neural induction efficient. Some of these should include glass coverslips (pre-treated accordingly) to be used for immunofluorescence assay.\nOptional: Other matrices may also be used but laminin-111 promotes stem cell survival and proliferation and drives differentiation.\nIncubate iPSC (routinely cultured in 6-well plates and passaged at least 35 times) with 0.5 mM EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) diluted in PBS without calcium and magnesium (D8537, Sigma) for 15–20 min at 37°C (until cells detach). For each well in a 6-well plate add 1 mL of EDTA solution.\nCount cells using a hemocytometer.\nOptional: other cell counting methods may be used but the same method should be used throughout the protocol and for different runs of the differentiation experiments.\nCentrifuge the cells in suspension for 3 min at 180 g.\nResuspend cells in differentiation media (refer to “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]”) supplemented with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor Y-27632.\nPlate cells at 80,000 cells/cm2. Keep cells in this supplemented media for the two subsequent days. Culture cells at 37°C in 5% (v/v) CO2.\nCritical: Cell density may vary across cell lines. Nonetheless, plates must be around 70% confluent after two days.\nNote: ROCK inhibition promotes cell survival.\nStart SMAD inhibition treatment (Day 2–11 of the differentiation)",

These must be previously reconstituted in DMSO, filter-sterilized and diluted to 1000× working stocks and aliquoted. Stocks must be keep protected from light and stored at −20°C. Once thawed, aliquots should be keep at room temperature for a maximum of 2 weeks. Culture cells at 37°C in 5% (v/v) CO2.\nFor each day until Day 11: Remove 80% of the media and incubate with cells with differentiation media (refer to “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]”) supplemented with 10 μM SB431542 and 100 nM LDN. Culture cells at 37°C in 5% (v/v) CO2.\nCritical: To prevent cell detachment, media should be removed and added with care.\nCritical: SB431542 and LDN must be added fresh to the differentiation media.\nNote: By Day 11 of the differentiation, neural cultures should be characterized by a complete and homogenous neuroepithelial monolayer of neural progenitors.\nAssessment of neural induction\nTiming: Day 11 of the differentiation + three days of analysis.\nTroubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]\nAnalysis of neural markers by immunofluorescence\nFixation of cells:\nGently wash control cultures three times with 4°C PBS.

Abbreviation: days (d).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1533_5.csv\nCortical neurogenesis\nTiming: 69 days\nOnce cells are programmed towards a neural lineage, primary and secondary cortical stem and progenitor cells arise and populate the neural cultures (Shi et al., 2012b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib30]). The primary cortical progenitor cells (characterized by Pax6+/OTX2+/Ki67+, polarization and radial processes) generated from iPSC eventually form rosettes (Shi et al., 2012a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib29]; 2012b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib30]) (visible at Day 13 of the differentiation). These cells then give rise to secondary progenitor cells, which are composed of two subpopulations: basal/intermediate progenitor cells (characterized by TBR2+/Ki67+/Pax6- and the lack of basal processes) and radial glial cells (marked by Pax6+/TBR2- and with lengthy processes) (Shi et al., 2012a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib29]; 2012b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib30]). Secondary progenitor cells are present at the periphery of each rosette (Shi et al., 2012a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib29]; 2012b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib30]) (seen more clearly at Day 18).\nFollowing the establishment of cortical neural rosettes, fundamental principles of neural development govern the ability of these three critical classes of progenitors to generate complex populations of cortical projection neurons, in a cell-intrinsic manner. Around 2–3 weeks into differentiation, early-born deep-layer neurons (TBR1+ and/or CTIP2+) form. Late-born upper-layer neurons (Stab2+/Cux1+/Brn2+), on the other hand, can only be detected later (after around 70 days of differentiation) (Shi et al., 2012a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib29]; 2012b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib30]).\nPassage neuroepithelial cells (Day 11 of the differentiation).",

This should be done not only at the end of the differentiation process, but also throughout its course to ensure reproducibility of the protocol and assess whether the neuronal cultures are maturing with similar dynamics and have similar differentiation potentials. Throughout cortical neurogenesis, a rise in markers of secondary progenitors (FOXG1 and TBR2) is expected.

Prepare solutions fresh in glass bottles.\nSWATH-MS\nTiming: ∼1 week\nThe label-free quantitative comparison of proteomes is performed by a method termed Sequential Windowed Acquisition of all Theoretical Spectra (SWATH) (Gillet et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). The SWATH method has been described elsewhere (Huang et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]; Rosenberger et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]). Using SWATH, the mass spectrometer cycles through 400–1100 Th precursor mass ranges, following a scheme of precursor isolation windows. In this data-independent mode, all product ion spectra are obtained in a systemic and unbiased fashion (Ludwig et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]). Following, SWATH mass spectrometry, data are extracted to provide quantitative information on proteins expressed in two different states – in this case, neurons expressing and lacking CHIP protein. In order to extract such data, we first prepared a spectral library by measurement of the same sample set but in a data-dependent manner (DDA/shotgun proteomics) using the same liquid chromatography conditions.\nPeptide sample dissolution (evaporated samples).

Additionally the number of identifications is determined (should be at least 1,000 proteins identified FDR<1%).\nSample injection volumes are set to reach the maximum allowed full mass spectrometric intensity (1.0e9 AU) utilizing absorbance values at 220 nm and 280 nm measured by NanoDrop (2000) (Thermo, MA, USA). Next, use these absorbance values to dilute the samples in order to load approximately 2 μg of peptides in a column injection volume of 3.7 μL.\nLiquid chromatography separation and data dependent acquisition to generate an in-house spectral library\nPool replicates from knockout and wild-type cell lines equimolarly to prepare a spectral library of pooled samples.\nInject approximately 2 μg of pooled peptides onto a Eksigent Ekspert nanoLC 400 (AB-SCIEX, Canada) connected to a TripleTOF 5600+ mass spectrometer (AB-SCIEX, Canada).\nPre-concentrate the sample on a cartridge trap column (300 μm i.d. × 5 mm) packed with C18 PepMap100 sorbent with 5 μm particle size (Thermo Scientific, MA, USA) using a mobile phase composed of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in 2% (v/v) ACN.",

The precursor range is set from 400 Th up to 1200 Th and it is divided into 67 precursor SWATH windows with a 12 Th width and 1 Th overlap.

Rolling collision energy setting with 15 mV collision energy spread is used.\nNote: Biological duplicates are considered a minimal for each condition (and controls) studied if the results are followed up by validation. Immunoblot analysis, 2D-gel electrophoresis, activity assays or quantitative immunofluorescence approaches can all be used to confirm changes in steady state protein levels, post-translational status or catalytic activity, for example, as appropriate. Biological Triplicates are generally thought to be minimal if no validation is performed.\nAnalysis of proteomics\nTiming: ∼2 weeks\nQuantitative proteomic data are extracted from the SWATH-derived spectral data. This allows protein quantities to be quantified and statistically compared between conditions (CHIP-expressing cortical neurons with the knockout cells) resulting in protein fold-changes and their corresponding p-values. Bioinformatic analysis are undertaken to identify significantly associated Gene Ontology (GO) terms (biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components) and these are graphically represented using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrate Discovery (DAVID). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) is used for pathway analysis. Together these tools contribute to the identification of pathways predicted to be altered that may be driven by proteomic differences between the CHIP isogenic cortical neruons. This aids in the identification of putative targets that may be directly or indirectly affected by the expression of functional CHIP, shaping subsequent investigation and validation screens.",

This is calculated based on comparison of the protein data with literature-based molecular networks and regulatory dynamics.\nNote: The directionality parameter (i.e., the z-score) and literature-based pathway prediction make the IPA tool unique compared to others that just focus on statistical enrichment in an overlapping set of genes (Krämer et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18])."
