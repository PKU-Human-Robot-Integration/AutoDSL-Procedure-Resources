    "All animal studies were performed according to the guidelines of UCLA's animal care and use committee and the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The duration of the procedure described below is approximately 45-60 min from beginning to end.\n1. Preparation of Surgical Field\nPerform procedure in a clean animal surgery room.\nEquipment: isoflurane Vaporizer, Gaymer T Pump with heating pad.\nSterile tools: two curved forceps, fine scissors, needle holder.\nSterile gloves must be used during the entire procedure.\n2. Preparation of Animals\nPlace two male or female mice, from same genetic background, of similar weight and size in the same cage and monitor for at least two weeks to ensure harmonious cohabitation. Female mice are preferred due to their less aggressive behavior.\nAnesthetize animals by using an isoflurane vaporizer. Place mice in a Posi-Seal Induction Chamber connected to the isoflurane vaporizer (4-5% v/v). Once anesthesia is induced, transfer the animal to the fur shaving area and maintain the anesthesia throughout the procedure through a nose cone connected to isoflurane (1.5-2% v/v). Apply ophthalmic ointment with a Q-tip to prevent dry eyes.\nPlace the animal on the supine position. Thoroughly shave the left side of the mouse placed on the left and the right side of the mouse placed on the right starting at approximately 1 cm above the elbow to 1 cm below the knee.\nAseptically prepare the shaved areas by thoroughly wiping (2-3x) with Betadine-soaked wipes followed by alcohol wipes. Place the mice on a heated pad covered by a sterile pad.\nFor analgesia, administer Carprofen and Buprenorphine intraperitoneally or subcutaneously at a dose of 10 mg/kg and 0.1 mg/kg respectively.",
    "Place animals on their side, back to back, with adjacent shaved areas facing up. To avoid any contamination of the surgical area, cover the mice with a sterile drape exposing only the operation area. Create a small drape opening to stay sterile when performing the surgery. We made the drape window large to have a better viewing during videotaping.\n3. Parabiosis\nUsing a sharp scissor, perform longitudinal skin incisions to the shaved sides of each animal starting at 0.5 cm above the elbow all the way to 0.5 cm below the knee joint (Figure 1). Following the incision, gently detach the skin from the subcutaneous fascia by holding the skin up with a pair of curved forceps and separate the fascia with a second pair to create 0.5 cm of free skin. Perform this separation along the entire incision.\nBegin the joining by attaching the left olecranon of one animal to the right olecranon of the other. Both olecranons and knee joints are clearly distinguishable following the skin incision. To facilitate the joining, bend the elbow of the first mouse and pass the needle of the non-absorbable 3-0 suture under the olecranon. Similarly, bend the elbow of the second mouse and pass the same suture under it. Attach joints tightly by a double surgical knot.\nConnect the knee joints following the same procedure.",
    "Following the attachment of the joints, connect the skin of the two animals with a continuous absorbable 5-0 Vicryl suture starting ventrally from the elbow towards the knee. To prevent skin rupture and separation perform a tight suture closure of the skin in the area around the elbows and knees. Once the ventral skin attachment has been completed, perform a double surgical knot. Place the mice in the prone position and continue the suture dorsally ending with a double surgical knot. Verify the continuity of the suture and confirm the lack of openings.\nAdminister 0.5 ml of 0.9% NaCl subcutaneously to each mouse to prevent dehydration.\n4. Postoperative Recovery\nKeep animals on heated pad until recovery.\nFollowing recovery, provide analgesics carprofen and buprenorphine. Repeat intraperitoneally or subcutaneously every 24 and 12 hr, respectively, for 48 hr at the same doses described above (step 2.5). Monitor animals for signs of pain and distress such as shaking, lethargy, chewing of tail, arched back, lack of grooming, etc. daily for two weeks.\nProphylactically, treat mice with Sulfamethoxazole /Trimethoprim oral suspension in their water bottle 2 mg sulfa/ml +0.4 mg trim/ml for 10 days to prevent bacterial infections.\nHouse each parabiotic pair in a clean cage with monolithic bedding material (e.g. paper towel or absorbent sterile pad) to prevent aspiration of bedding material. Return the animals to a bedding filled cage when they are able to maintain sternal recumbency with their head up. To minimize the strain of reaching for food while adjusting to parabiotic existence, place the moistened food pellets on the cage floor. Provide nesting material. In 1-2 weeks parabiotic mice have the ability to ambulate normally on surgically paired fore-and hind-limbs.\nBlood chimerism occurs 10-14 days following the surgery.\n5. Confirmation and Reverse Procedure",
    "After two weeks draw blood from the tail veins of each mouse for flow-cytometric analysis to confirm blood chimerism (Figure 3).\nBlood processing for flow cytometric analysis: dilute 2-3 drops of blood in 500 μl of 10 mM EDTA. Add 500 μl of 2% dextran (diluted in PBS), mix thoroughly and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min. Transfer the supernatant in a new tube, spin at 1,200 rpm for 5 min and resuspend the pelleted cells in PBS (or other buffer) for flow cytometric analysis.\nDepending on experimental design, the parabiotic pair can be separated at later time points. In our experience, we have maintained parabiosed pairs for up to 9 months without any complications.\nPerform reverse procedure on a sterile surgical surface. Anesthetize mice by placing them in an induction chamber connected to an isoflurane vaporizer (4-5%) and maintain anesthesia with 1.5-2% isoflurane, as described above (step 2.2).\nRemove hair from the area surrounding the initial suture and aseptically prepare the shaved areas as described above (steps 2.3, 2.4).\nFor analgesia, administer Carprofen and Buprenorphine intraperitoneally or subcutaneously at a dose of 10 mg/kg and 0.1 mg/kg, respectively.\nCover surgical area with a sterile drape as described above (step 2.6).\nUsing sharp scissors, separate the mice through a longitudinal incision along the lateral suture and gently detach the newly formed fascia between the two mice with a pair of curved forceps. To separate the joints, cut the knots of the suture connecting them. Trim off the skin along the incision to achieve smooth edges and reattach skin with an absorbable continuous 5-0 coated Vicryl suture.\nTo prevent dehydration, administer 0.5 ml of 0.9% NaCl subcutaneously to each mouse. Keep animals on heated pad until recovery.",
    "After recovery, repeat analgesic administration, carprofen (10 mg/kg) every 24 hr and buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) every 12 hr for 48 hr.\nTo prevent bacterial infections treat mice with Sulfamethoxazole /Trimethoprim oral suspension (2 mg sulfa/ml +0.4 mg trim/ml) in their water bottle for 10 days.\nSubscription Required.
