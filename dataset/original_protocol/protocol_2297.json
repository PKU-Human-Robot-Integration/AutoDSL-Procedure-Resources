    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPart 1: Preparation of SNAP- and Halo-tagged constructs for expressing SNAP/Halo-tagged proteins of interest in Xenopus embryos\nTiming: 3 days\nThis step prepares the materials (SNAP/Halo-tagged DNA constructs, mRNAs, fertilized Xenopus embryos) necessary for live imaging of SNAP/Halo-tagged proteins of interest in live Xenopus embryos. The frog handling portion of the protocol is adapted from Sive et al. (2010)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13].\nCritical: To successfully visualize your SNAP- or Halo-tagged protein of interest, it is imperative that the sequence of interest is cloned into the SNAP- or Halo-expression vector in frame without intervening stop codons.\nNote: SNAPf is an updated version of SNAP-tag, that is optimized for faster substrate labeling (Cole, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nNote: To optimize expression of the SNAP- and Halo-tagged proteins in Xenopus embryos, we codon optimized both tags: SNAPf (codon 436), Halo (codons 82, 121, 154, 166, 403, 511, 517, 535, 571, 643, 655, 700, 742, 802, 832, 856, 868, 871).\nNote: Both SNAP- and Halo-tagging systems appear to be equally effective in tagging and visualizing proteins of interest. Differences in visualization between SNAP- and Halo-tagging appear to be a result of dye differences, rather than the tag.\nClone sequence of interest into the appropriate SNAPf/Halo pCS2+ vector backbone (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1903-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Workflow for expression of pCS2+/SNAPf- and Halo-tagged constructs in Xenopus embryos\npCS2+/SNAPf- and Halo-vectors that were codon optimized for Xenopus can be acquired from Addgene. The sequence of interest is cloned into the multiple cloning site (MCS), located upstream/downstream of the SNAPf/Halo-tag. Tagged constructs are in vitro transcribed to generate mRNA that is microinjected into 2–4 cell stage Xenopus embryos.\nClone sequence of interest into the multiple cloning site (MCS) that is directly upstream or downstream of the SNAPf- or Halo-tag.",
    "Pause point: The use of these constructs is not time sensitive, DNA can be stored at −20°C for later use.\nIn vitro transcribe the plasmid containing the SNAPf-/Halo-tagged sequence of interest.\nLinearize the vector using NotI or KpnI restriction enzymes.\nNote: Make sure the sequence of interest does not contain the restriction site for the restriction enzyme used.\nNote: To check for proper linearization, the vector should be run on a gel before proceeding to in vitro transcription.\nIn vitro transcribe the linearized plasmid following the instructions in the SP6 mMessage mMachine kit.\nPurify the mRNA following the instructions in the RNeasy kit.\nNote: The mRNA should be run on a gel before experimental use to ensure expected size and purity.\nPause point: The use of these mRNAs is not time sensitive, mRNA can be stored at −80°C for later experiments.\nPrime the adult female Xenopus laevis frog by injecting 50 units of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) into the dorsal lymph sac several days before the experiment (e.g., 3–7 days).\nThe afternoon before egg collection (e.g., 14–24 h before egg collection), induce ovulation by injecting 400–800 units of HCG into the dorsal lymph sac of the primed frog.\nCollect eggs from the adult female frog (Sive et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]) in a petri dish filled with 1× MMR.\nUsing a transfer pipette, remove most of the MMR, leaving ∼1/10 the of the 1× MMR remaining.\nFertilize the eggs with about one quarter of a testes harvested from an adult male Xenopus laevis frog (Sive et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nMacerate the testes using forceps to ensure release of the sperm.\nWait 1 min, and fill the dish with water, resulting in ∼0.1× MMR.",
    "Dejelly the embryos at least 30 min post-fertilization with 2% Cysteine (in 1× MMR) adjusted to pH 7.8 (Sive et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nReplace media on embryos with cysteine solution, transfer embryos to a 50 mL falcon tube, bring volume of cysteine solution to ∼25 mL.\nGently swirl the embryos. Once the embryos lose their jelly coating and settle to the bottom of the falcon tube, pour out the cysteine.\nRinse the embryos twice with 1× MMR and twice with 0.1× MMR.\nSeparate the embryos into petri dishes, removing any unhealthy embryos. Incubate the embryos in 0.1× MMR until they reach 2–4 cell stage (∼1.5–2 h post-fertilization).\nIncubate dishes of embryos at 13, 15, 17°C, and room temperature (RT, 22°C) to spread the window of time embryos are at 2–4 cell stage to allow more time for microinjection.\nNote: This range of temperatures supports normal development of Xenopus embryos.\nPart 2: SNAP- and Halo-dye introduction\nTiming: 18 h – 1 day\nThis step provides two options for introducing SNAP- and Halo-dyes to intact Xenopus embryos.\nNote: There are several possible methods for dye introduction (other potential methods discussed in troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]). Co-microinjecting the dye with mRNAs or bathing the embryos in dye are the most straightforward dye introduction approaches for intact Xenopus embryos (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) (see Problem 4 in troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]). Both methods are compatible with the expression of other conventional fluorescently-tagged proteins.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1903-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Dye introduction methods for labeling SNAPf- or Halo-tagged proteins expressed in intact Xenopus embryos\n(Top) SNAP/Halo dyes can be microinjected with SNAPf- or Halo-tagged mRNAs. (Bottom) After microinjecting SNAPf- or Halo-tagged mRNAs, embryos can also be bathed in SNAP/Halo dyes overnight (O/N, 15–22 h) for next-day imaging.",
    "Note: Optimization of both dye concentration and amount of microinjected mRNA is necessary to achieve optimal visualization (see Problem 1 in troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nNote: In our experience, Halo-tag paired with a “no-wash” Janelia Fluor dye led to optimal visualization.\nNote: Timing depends on the temperature the embryos are incubated at (e.g., 13, 15, 17°C, and RT (22°C)) and the developmental stage that you want to image, and can be modified to align with your scheduled imaging time.\nCo-microinjecting dye with mRNA\nBefore microinjecting, prepare materials for microinjection:\nPrepare microinjection needles. Pull needles using 10 μL glass capillary tubes to create needles with a long, thin point.\nSet-up microinjector, turn on N2 tank.\nCalibrate the needle. Break the end of the needle using forceps. Attach needle to microinjector tubing. Fill the needle with RNase free water, and adjust the pressure and injection time on the microinjector so that it produces a 5 nL droplet in mineral oil.\nResuspend SNAP- or Halo-dye aliquot to an appropriate stock concentration using RNase free water.\nCritical: Vortex to ensure even suspension of the dye.\nNote: Precautions to maintain dye integrity should be made by working with the dyes in minimal light during resuspension and incubation. Any overhead lights in the room should be turned off during dye resuspension, to reduce the risk of dye breakdown. During incubation, embryos are kept in dark incubators with tinted windows.\nNote: Stock concentration of dye aliquots used in the SNAP- and Halo-experiments in this protocol was 200 μM. We recommend keeping aliquots at least 10-fold higher than the concentration of dye used in experiments (see Problem 5 in troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nMix the dye and mRNA encoding the proteins of interest to make a microinjection mix.",
    "Mix the microinjection droplet by pipetting up and down with a micropipetter to ensure an even distribution of the dye and mRNA within the droplet (the droplet may exhibit a color depending on the concentration of dye(s) in the droplet).\nFill the needle with the microinjection mix.\nNote: SNAP- and Halo-dyes can be co-microinjected in the same microinjection mix.\nNote: We dilute dye and mRNA to a 5× stock concentration and then add 1 μL of each to a droplet that has a final volume of 5 μL. If needed, RNase free water is added to raise the droplet volume to 5 μL.\nNote: The concentration of microinjected SNAP- or Halo-tagged mRNA was generally the same concentration used for the equivalent mNeon-tagged mRNA for the protein of interest but would need to be determined empirically.\nInject 2–4 cell stage Xenopus embryos with 5 nL of the microinjection mix at two distinct locations within the animal hemisphere.\nNote: To target epithelial cells, we injected in the animal hemisphere. However, injections could be targeted to any region of interest according to the Xenopus fate map.\nNote: We injected embryos in 0.1× MMR. Injections can also be performed in 5% Ficoll (in 0.1× MMR).\nIncubate the embryos co-microinjected with dye and mRNA in 35 mm × 10 mm petri dishes filled with 0.1× MMR, leaving enough space so that the embryos are not crowded.\nIncubate the embryos in a dark incubator at 15°C or 17°C overnight (15–22 h) for next-day imaging of embryos at gastrula stage.\nBathing embryos in dye\nBefore bathing embryos in dye, prepare materials for microinjection, and microinject the embryos:\nPrepare microinjection needles. Pull needles using 10 μL glass capillary tubes to create needles with a long, thin point.\nSet-up microinjector, turn on N2 tank.",
    "Calibrate the needle. Break the end of the needle using forceps. Attach needle to microinjector tubing. Fill the needle with RNase free water, and adjust the pressure and injection time on the microinjector so that it produces a 5 nL droplet in mineral oil.\nPrepare the 5 μL microinjection mix (see step 10, but don't add dye), containing mRNA encoding the proteins of interest, and fill the needle with the microinjection mix.\nNote: The concentration of microinjected SNAP- or Halo-tagged mRNA was generally the same concentration used for the equivalent mNeon-tagged mRNA for the protein of interest but would need to be determined empirically.\nInject 2–4 cell stage Xenopus embryos with 5 nL of the microinjection mix at two distinct locations within the animal hemisphere.\nIncubate the embryos microinjected with mRNA in petri dishes filled with 0.1× MMR at 17°C until dye bath is prepared in the 96-well plate.\nResuspend SNAP- or Halo-dye aliquot to working concentration using 0.1× MMR, and add 300 μL of the resuspended dye to a single well within a 96-well plate.\nCritical: Pipette thoroughly to ensure a homogeneous dye solution.\nUsing a transfer pipette, add 10–15 Xenopus embryos microinjected with SNAP and/or Halo mRNAs to the well.\nCritical: When adding the embryos to the well, touch the tip of the micropipette to the surface of the dye bath, allowing the embryos to drop into to the well, without transferring additional 0.1× MMR.\nNote: No more than 15 embryos were added to each well to facilitate dye diffusion.\nNote: SNAP- and Halo-dyes can be included in the same dye bath (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nIncubate the 96-well plate at 15 or 17°C overnight (15–22 h) for next-day imaging of embryos at gastrula stage.\nPart 3: Live confocal imaging of SNAP- and Halo-tagged proteins\nTiming: 4 h",
    "This step allows you to visualize the SNAP- and/or Halo-tagged protein of interest bound to its dye partner in gastrula-stage Xenopus embryos using confocal microscopy.\nRemove gastrula-stage (Nieuwkoop and Faber stage 10.5–12) Xenopus embryos from the incubator.\nUsing a dissecting microscope, select the embryos that will be prepared for live imaging.\nCritical: Choose embryos that appear healthy and have even pigmentation.\nNote: For embryos bathed in dye, transfer the embryos from the 96-well plate to a petri dish containing 0.1× MMR before viewing.\nPrepare imaging slide (Woolner et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]).\nNote: There are multiple methods that can be used to mount Xenopus embryos for live imaging. We use a 0.8 mm thick custom metal slide that has a 5 mm circular hole cut in the center.\nApply a thin layer of vacuum grease to both sides of the slide.\nPlace a square coverslip on one side of the slide, making a well.\nAdd 3 embryos and a small volume of 0.1× MMR to the well.\nPlace a second square coverslip on top of the embryos, gently sandwiching the embryos between the two glass coverslips.\nUsing a confocal microscope (we use a 60× objective on an inverted Olympus FV1000), focus on one of the embryos.\nImaging can now be conducted as it would for any other fluorescently-labeled protein of interest expressed in Xenopus embryos.\nNote: Some dyes, including the Janelia Fluors, possess a very bright signal, so laser power may need to be adjusted to very low levels.\nNote: Several factors contribute to successful visualization of SNAP- and Halo-tagged proteins (see Problems 1, 2, and 3 in troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nNote: We used FIJI software to process the images presented in this protocol."
