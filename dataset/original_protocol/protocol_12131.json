    "Use male Fischer 344-Brown Norway rats at 6 and 30 months of age for this protocol. Rats were obtained from the National Institute of Aging rodent colony. We used rats for this study because the structure of the rat larynx is similar to that of the human, functionally serving for airway protection and species-specific vocalizations This study was performed in accordance with the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. et seq.); the animal use protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Kentucky.\n1. Anesthesia of Rats\nPrepare the anesthetics by mixing ketamine hydrochloride (dissociative anesthetic) and xylazine hydrochloride (sedative and analgesic) in buffered saline. The concentrations of ketamine and xylazine in the final solution are 100 mg/8 mg per kg body weight respectively.\nInject the anesthetics into the rat by intraperitoneal administration using a syringe with a 25 G needle.\nDetermine that the rat is sufficiently anesthetized by pinching the toe or foot with forceps. If the rat does not react to the pinch, then surgery can begin. If the rat reacts to the toe pinch with reflex or muscle contractions, then wait 1-2 min and repeat the pinch test. If the rat reacts again, replace the rat with a new animal and repeat procedure beginning from step 1.2.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to the rat's eyes, after the rat is immobile, to prevent the corneas from drying out.\n2. Osmotic Pump Implantation\nPlace the rat ventral on the aseptic surgical area.  Administer meloxicam as a preanesthetic medication. Administer intraperitoneally at a dosage of 1-4 mg/kg of body weight using a syringe with a 25 G needle.",
    "Use clippers to remove an approximately 1\" x 1\" square of fur from back of neck, and approximately 1\" caudal of space between shoulders. Shave as close to the skin as possible.\nWet the back and neck with disinfecting ethanol (70%).\nAfter shaving, scrub the dorsal aspect of the neck with 3 scrubs in succession of iodine-alcohol finishing with alcohol.\nMaintain the body temperature of the rat by placing it on a heating pad set to 34 °C.\nFill aseptically prepared osmotic pumps with either 50 µL of NTF4 or saline for systemic NTF4 treatment (Figure 1).\nUse a scalpel to make a horizontal incision approximately 2 cm wide through the skin, just cranial to the space between the scapulae. Lift the posterior edge of the incision with forceps with one hand while inserting the tip of hemostats and gently pushing posterior to the incision.\nAfter the tip of the hemostats is approximately 2 cm cranial to the incision, open the handles on the hemostats, expanding the tips to form a hollow \"pocket\" subcutaneous to the incision site. This will be the placement site for the pump.\nOrient the pump delivery portal end first upon insertion to minimize any interaction of the NTF4 and the healing of the pocket incision site.\nDeliver 50 µL of NTF4 saline for either 7 14 days. The 7 day group received 6.72 mg/day of NTF4 for a total dose of 47.04 mg. The 14-day group received 6.72 mg/day for a total dose of 94.08 mg of NTF425.\nUse 5-0 nylon suture thread, hemostats and forceps to close the incision made for pump placement.",
    "Observe the rats for a minimum of 30 min as they recover from anesthesia. Criteria for completion of monitoring include the animal becoming active, moving about the cage, drinking water, and beginning other normal activities such as grooming.\nMonitor animals daily for the first week by observing the healing of surgical site, normal feed and water consumption and passing of urine/feces, and any abnormal behavioral signs of stress, pain, or other post-operative complications.\nIf the rat appears to be in pain or distress, provide the rat with a 5 mg/kg subcutaneous injection of carprofen once every 24 h for up to 5 days to relieve pain.\nIf there appears to be an infection, consult a veterinarian to ensue that the wound heals properly.\nDepending on which experimental group the rat in in, remove the 5-0 nylon suture 7-10 days following surgery to prevent irritation from the thread.\n3. Anesthesia of Rats for Direct Injection\nWithhold food from the rats the night before the procedure. This ensures that there is no food to block the endoscope or injection needle.\nWeigh rats and prepare acepromazine 1-2 mg/kg body weight. Inject intramuscularly (the IM location is the left thyroarytenoid muscle).\nPlace the rat in the induction box. Induce anesthesia in the induction box with 5% isoflurane and 1 L O2.\nMove the rat to a nose cone with 2% isoflurane and 600 mL O2.",
    "Determine that the rat is sufficiently anesthetized by pinching the toe or foot with forceps. If the rat does not react to the pinch, then the injection protocol can begin. If the rat reacts to the toe pinch with reflex or muscle contractions, then wait 1-2 min and repeat the pinch test. If the rat reacts again, replace the rat with a new animal and repeat procedure beginning from step 3.4.\n4. Direct Injection and Visualization\nPlace aseptically prepared 50-µL dosages containing NTF4 or saline in a H2O bath set to 25° C for 30 min before injection.\nPlace the rat in a supine and reclined position on a plexiglass platform (Figure 2). Suspend the rat in the reclined posture from their frontal top incisors via a guide wire strung across the top of the platform.\nAttach a 50 mm, 30 gauge, 100 µL syringe to a 1.9 mm, 30° sinus endoscope (Figure 3).\n\tNOTE: The syringe assembly is attached via a jig that holds the cannula firmly to the outer wall of the endoscope. The endoscope allows for visualization of the vocal folds and guidance of the syringe intraorally. The position of the cannula tip is adjusted prior to each animal to ensure that the tip is fully and clearly visible via the endoscopic view (Figure 4).\nUse a rubber-tipped pair of forceps to extend the tongue and move it laterally. Afterward, insert a plastic speculum to maintain oral patency. Make the speculum from a 5 mL plastic syringe barrel that is cut to a length of 1.5 to 2 cm, with the cut edges deburred and polished smooth.\nTurn off the lights in the room and attach a halogen light source to the endoscope. Turn on the video recorder to capture the procedure.",
    "Immerse the distal end of the endoscope in warm water for a few seconds to minimize the development of condensation on the glass tip when inserted into the mouth of the rat.\nUsing visual feedback from the monitor, carefully guide the needle to the area of the left vocal fold.\nTime the injection of the solution with the inspiratory phase of the animals' respiration cycle to fully access the vocal fold. During the inspiratory phase of respiration, the vocal fold is fully exposed.\nOnce the vocal fold is fully visible, insert the needle into the left thyroarytenoid, found lateral to the white medial edge of the vocal fold. With the needle in place, deliver the injectate through depression of the syringe.\nTurn off the halogen light source on the endoscope and the video player, and turn back on the room lights.\nReturn the rat to its home cage and place on a heating pad.\nAllow the rat to recover before removal from the heating pad. Replace food and water in the cage.\nMonitor rats for 7 days after the injection and then euthanize. Remove the larynges for cryosectioning24.\n5. Euthanization of Rats\nAnesthetize rats with ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine hydrochloride (100 mg/8 mg per kg body weight injected intraperitoneal injection).\nEuthanize by exsanguination following a medial thoracotomy.\nSubscription Required.
