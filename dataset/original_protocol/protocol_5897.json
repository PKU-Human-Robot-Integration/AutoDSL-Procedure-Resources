    "The coding sequence of the protein of interest is cloned into the pET32a plasmid (Merck, Novagen®) and transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells.Recombinant protein expressionGrow E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells in 500 ml LB media containing 100 μg/ml of carbenicillin overnight at 30 °C, in a shaker incubator.Induce protein expression with 1 mM IPTG for 4.5 h at 30 °C.Note: For verification of protein expression, take 1 ml of cell culture and spin at 2,300 x g for 1 min to collect the cell pellet. Add 100 μl of 2x Sample buffer, and heat at 95 °C for 5 min to prepare the protein sample for SDS-PAGE analysis. Collect the cell pellet in 50 ml tubes by spinning at 9,000 x g for 2 min at 4 °C and store the cell pellet at -80 °C.Protein extraction and purificationThe pET32a vector can provide a 6x His-tag on the N- or C-terminus of a recombinant protein. Below, we present the purification of a 6x His-tagged recombinant protein from E. coli BL21 (DE3) cell lysates using the Ni-NTA spin column (QIAGEN), with some optimization from the manufacturer’s handbook.Thaw the cell pellet on ice and resuspend cells in 10 ml (1/50 to 1/100 of cell culture volume) of Lysis buffer. Note: Keep buffers, cell suspension and protein at 0-4 °C for the duration of extraction and purification.  Incubate cells on ice for 30 min with gentle vortexing.Sonicate on ice using two 30 sec bursts at 400 W with 2 min cooling between bursts.Centrifuge at 9,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C to pellet the cell debris. Transfer the supernatant to a new 50 ml tube.Note: If the supernatant is murky, repeat this step once. Prepare the Ni-NTA column for purification by equilibrating the column with 600 μl of Lysis buffer.",
    "Centrifuge at 890 x g, 4 °C for 2 min with the lid open.Transfer the supernatant containing the soluble fraction of the recombinant protein to the Ni-NTA column for purification. Up to 600 μl of lysate can be loaded each time. Centrifuge for 5 min at 270 x g, 4 °C. Discard flow-through (soluble His-tagged protein will now be bound to Ni-NTA column).Note: Take 20 μl of lysate for SDS-PAGE analysis. Add in 20 μl of 2x Sample buffer, and heat at 95 °C for 5 min before storing at -20 °C. Wash the column twice with Wash buffer. Centrifuge for 2 min at 890 x g, 4 °C.Elute the 6x His-tagged protein twice with 300 μl of Elution buffer. Collect the eluate (eluted target protein) by centrifuging at 890 x g for 2 min, 4 °C.Repeat Steps B5-B8 for remaining lysates. Consolidate eluates for the next step (Step B10).Load the eluate (target protein) into the top chamber of a Pierce Protein Concentrator (10K MWCO) to exchange the Elution buffer and concentrate the protein. Immediately top up the eluate (target protein) with Exchange buffer to 5 ml. Centrifuge at 9,000 x g, 4 °C until the sample volume is less than 500 μl. Remove and discard the flow-through in the bottom collection chamber. Repeat this step at least 5 times to ensure the final imidazole concentration is lower than 0.1 mM.Note: The Exchange buffer pH is determined by the isoelectric point of the recombinant protein. Use a pipette to gently aspirate the concentrated protein within the top chamber. Transfer the concentrated protein into a microcentrifuge tube. Assess the protein concentration with NanoDrop.Dilute the protein to 100 μM with Exchange buffer and store at -80 °C.Note: To confirm protein integrity, take 20 μl of the recombinant protein for SDS-PAGE analysis.",
    "Add in 20 μl of 2x Sample buffer, and heat at 95 °C for 5 min before storing at -20 °C. Bio-layer interferometry binding assayWe performed bio-layer interferometry binding on a FortéBIO® Octet RED96 instrument (PALL).Turn on the instrument in advance for at least 15 to 20 min to warm up the lamp. Set the working temperature to 30 °C to pre-warm the sample plate holder (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180912/20180912024125_5011.jpgFigure 1. Octet RED96 machine. Switch power on to warm up Octet RED96 machine. When the blue indicator light is illuminated as shown, the equipment is ready for use. Prepare the Assay bufferNote: A buffer test needs to be conducted to determine the appropriate Assay buffer for each protein. Pre-wet the streptavidin sensors in the Assay buffer for at least 10 min at room temperature, to remove the sucrose coating on the sensors (Figure 2). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180912/20180912024143_4479.jpgFigure 2. Preparation of sensors. Detach the green sensors holder from the plate holder (blue), followed by the addition of assay buffer (250 μl per well) into plate wells (black) (A). Finally, fit the green sensor holder (with sensor tips) onto the plate holder (B). Caution should be exercised not to touch the sensor tips. Verify the sensor tips are immersed and pre-wet in the assay buffer.Set up the experimental design in the Octet data acquisition software (v9.0, PALL) using the experiment wizard tab (Figure 3). The tab menu includes:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180912/20180912024201_0437.jpgFigure 3. Startup of experimental design in Octet data acquisition software. In the Octet data acquisition software window, select ‘New Kinetics Experiment’ (‘Basic Kinetics’ option) as shown. Under available templates, select ‘Kinetic Characterization_8CH_96W.fmf’ under ‘Biomolecule Kinetics - SA biosensor’ if Streptavidin biosensors are used. Click on the green arrow button to enter the program.Plate definition (Figure 4).",
    "Assign the content of each column, including the buffer, biotin-labeled histone peptide, and binding protein to be tested. Enter the concentration of the binding protein in each well. In addition, a reference well with Assay buffer only needs to be included in the same column.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180912/20180912024215_4312.jpgFigure 4. Plate definition. Select the wells on the layout of the sample plate. Right click on each column to assign the content of each well in the plate layout (top left hand corner), ‘B’: Buffer, ‘L’: Load, ‘Pink Circles’ denote position where the samples are located. Enter additional identifier information (for example, buffer composition) in the table on the right.Assay definition (Figure 5). Usually, 5 steps are included in the binding kinetics assay between 2 objects: baseline 1, loading; baseline 2, association and disassociation. To generate a stable initial signal, in baseline 1 step, sensors need to be soaked in Assay buffer for at least 120 sec. The loading step immobilizes the biotin-labeled histone peptides on the sensors. The threshold function can be used to set the amount of peptide loaded onto the sensors. Sensors are then assigned to the Assay buffer again for at least 120 sec to establish another stable baseline signal (baseline 2) before the association step. During the association step, the sensors with immobilized peptides are assigned to the wells containing different concentrations of the protein of interest. Adjust the time of the association step so that the well with the highest protein concentration can reach the equilibrium binding signal. Finally, assign sensors to the Assay buffer again for a disassociation of 5 min.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180912/20180912024231_5235.jpgFigure 5. Assay definition.

    "Dilute the biotin-labeled histone peptides (Mimotope, Australia) to 5 μg/ml with Assay buffer and add 250 μl of each peptide into the corresponding wells.Prepare a serial dilution of the purified recombinant protein with Assay buffer and transfer 250 μl of protein solution into each well corresponding to the design in Step C3.Carefully put the sensor tray on the sensor platform (left side inside the machine), and the sample tray onto the plate holder on the right.
