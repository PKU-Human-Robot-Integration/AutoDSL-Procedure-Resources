    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSample generation: Cell harvest with single-step lysis, reduction and alkylation\nTiming: 0.25 days\nCritical: The cells should be grown under sterile conditions in a biological safety cabinet. Ideally, prepare 5 or more replicates per biological condition.\nNote: the procedure and lysis buffer are applicable to protein extraction from most mammalian cells by varying the sonication time and intensity to best suit the sample source\nPreheat SDS lysis buffer to 95°C.\nAdd the boiling SDS lysis buffer to the samples:\nIf working with adherent cell lines:\nRemove medium from cells and wash them twice with phosphate salt buffered solution (PBS) (Life Technologies, Cat#14190-094).\nAdd boiling SDS lysis buffer directly to the plate and rapidly scrape the cells.\nTransfer the lysate to an Eppendorf tube. For a P15 cell plate at ∼ 80% confluency, use 300 μL of SDS lysis buffer.\nIf working with suspension cell lines:\nTransfer the cells to a falcon tube (or a tube appropriate to the cell volume).\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 400 × g for 3 min.\nWash the cell pellet with PBS twice and pellet the cells again by centrifugation (400 × g, 3 min).\nRemove the PBS and add boiling SDS buffer to the pellet. For a T-175, corresponding to about 20 million cells, use 300 μL of SDS lysis buffer.\nIf working with spheroids:\nAspirating half the medium and add 150 μL PBS.\nRepeat this process 4 times to remove traces of media.\nTransfer the spheroid to an Eppendorf tube and add boiling SDS buffer. For a single spheroid, use 200 μL of SDS lysis buffer.",
    "Critical: The PAC digestion is concentration dependent. It is recommended to lyse the cells in the lowest possible volume to keep the lysate concentrated and ensure an efficient digestion. The volume of lysis buffer given in this protocol should be scaled with the size of the dish/flask used.\nIncubate the lysates for 10 min at 95°C with mixing at 850 rpm in ThermoMixer (Eppendorf, Cat#538400001).\nNote: During boiling pressure can form inside the tube and lids can randomly open. To avoid this use “safe-lock” Eppendorf. When collecting the samples, carefully release the pressure by opening the lids.\nReduce viscosity by sonicating using a micro-tip probe (1 min, 1 s ON, 1 s OFF, 50% amplitude). If samples are in a 96-well format, an 8-tip probe can be used. Problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nTo clarify the lysate, centrifuge for 5 min as 10,000 g and transfer the supernatant to a clean tube.\nPause point: it is possible to store the cell/ spheroid extracts at −80°C.\nProtein Aggregation capture (PAC): On-bead protein precipitation, clean-up and digestion automated on KingFisher Flex (Apex, Duo, Prime) systems\nTiming: 1 day\nQuantify cell-extracted protein concentration using Pierce microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit - Reducing Agent Compatible (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #23227) according to manufacturer’s protocol[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0011614_Pierce_MicroplateBCAProteinAsy_ReducAgntComp_UG.pdf]: (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/23227[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/23227]).\nCritical: If using another quantification kit or method make sure it is compatible with reducing agents such as TCEP and detergents such as SDS.\nPrepare PAC buffers as per materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section:\nPAC Bind buffer: 100% MeCN.\nPAC Wash buffer 1: 95% MeCN.\nPAC Wash buffer 2: 70% EtOH.",
    "PAC Digest buffer: 50 mM AmmBic supplemented with Lys-C and Trypsin (1:500 and 1:250 respectively for 12 h digest of lysate inputs > 50 μg of protein at 37°C; 1:100 and 1:50 respectively for 6 h digest of lysate inputs < 50 μg of protein) at 37°C.\nNote: depending on downstream steps and input material the ideal digest buffer may change e.g., for downstream TMT labeling without peptide quantification use 100 mM HEPES buffer for PAC digest whilst for LFQ from low input material (i.e. single spheroid) where PAC is directly coupled to phosphopeptide enrichment it is recommended to utilize 50 mM TEAB as digest buffer instead of AmmBic.\nCritical: Add Lys-C and Trypsin fresh just before starting the KingFisher program.\nPrepare the KingFisher plates with beads, samples and solutions as per Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]/ Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A (KingFisher Flex or Apex models) or Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]/ Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B (KingFisher Duo or Presto models).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2975_24.csv\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2975-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

When calculating the volume of MeCN (bind solvent) to be added in order to initiate protein capture (final of 70% MeCN required) the MagReSyn Hydroxyl bead volume can be ignored, and calculated based only on sample volume (see Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2975_26.csv\nNote: for low protein amounts (<5 μg) it is recommended to reduce the digestion volume to 200 μL and digest a maximum of 6 h.",
    "Note: The recommended protein to bead ratio is 1:2 (for protein amounts ≥ 100 μg). For protein amounts < 100 μg use a constant Hydroxyl bead volume of 10 μL (see Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]).\nCritical: When dispensing the beads make sure storage container is frequently mixed to minimize beads from settling and thus ensure equal amount of beads is distributed in each well. For large scale experiments beads can be dispensed using multi-channel pipette. Frequent mixing using up/down pipetting is recommended in this case in order to keep beads in suspension.\nNote: MagReSyn Hydroxyl is formulated at 20 mg/mL in 20% EtOH\nCritical: For KingFisher deep well plates total volume (lysate and bind solvent) should not exceed 1 mL.\nRun the KingFisher method and once complete add formic acid to a final of 2% FA, or TFA to a final of 1%, to each sample in order to quench Lys-C / Trypsin activity and stop the digestion by reducing the pH to below 4. Problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nNote: Formic acid is recommended for low input lysate and thus digest amounts (≤ 50 μg) where direct phosphopeptide enrichment is performed without desalting. TFA is recommended in cases where desalting will be performed prior to phosphopeptide enrichment (lysate/ digest amount ≥ 50 μg).\nNote: For manual sample processing using PAC follow the same steps as described above using 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes together with a suitable magnetic separator such as DynaMag-2 Magnet (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#12321D). During the wash steps keep the beads on the magnetic separator. As a fail-safe, to prevent SDS contamination that may coat the side walls of the microcentrifuge tubes, transfer the protein-bead aggregates to new 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes after the second wash and before continuing with washes three to five.",
    "Critical: Sample can be clarified by centrifugation (10 min, 10,000 g) in particular if white precipitates are observed. These are likely due to residual nucleic acid or lipid contamination.\nFor label-free proteome analysis, transfer the equivalent of 750 ng of peptide digest directly to Evotips (Step 57). No quantification is performed on the peptide digest, instead we consider the recovery from the PAC digestion to be 25% (for 100 μg of protein input, we would recover 25 μg of peptides) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) and load accordingly.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2975-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. PAC with desalting digestion recovery for input amounts ranging from 100 μg to 500 μg HeLa lysate\nThe protein concentration was measured using BCA and the peptide concentration was estimated after peptide desalting using absorbance at 280 nm.\nKeep the remaining peptides and proceed to:\nIf input digest > 50 μg and/or TMT-based scheme will be used, continue to step 12 for peptide desalting.\nNote: It is possible to proceed directly to TMT labeling, without desalting. If so, it is important that the lysis and digest buffers are amine free i.e. utilize TEAB or HEPES instead of Tris-HCl or AmmBic, and the digest is not acidified in step 9. Please note that quantification of peptide amount is not accurate without first desalting. This can affect the ability to do equal TMT channel loading, which will in-turn increase the technical variability of the TMT workflow.\nIf input digest amount is ≤ 50 μg and the DIA label-free scheme will be used, concentrate the peptide in a SpeedVac at 45°C (1–4 h) until volume is < 20 μL. Then, proceed directly to phosphopeptide enrichment (step 37). Problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nNote: Extended drying times can result in phosphopeptide losses. In laboratories where freeze-drying equipment is available this could be utilized instead of vacuum drying.",
    "Critical: if proceeding to phosphopeptide enrichment it is recommended to avoid complete peptide drying of your peptide sample, but rather only reduce the sample volume to ∼ 20 μL, followed by dilution using phosphopeptide enrichment bind buffer (final 200 μL).\nPause point: it is possible to store acidified peptides at −20°C.\nDesalting\nTiming: 2 h\nNote: desalting is necessary before TMT-labeling if the digest buffer is not amine free and if TMT channel load needs to be adjusted by performing peptide quantification. It is further recommended for non-labeled peptides where digest amounts is ≥ 50 μg. Below this amount, one can proceed directly to phosphopeptide enrichment (step 37).\nPrepare the following solutions for desalting as per materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section:\nSPE buffer A: 0.1% TFA (stable up to 4 weeks at 4°C).\nSPE buffer B: 100% MeCN.\nSPE buffer C: 40% MeCN.\nSPE buffer D: 60% MeCN.\nDesalt peptides using Sep-Pak tC18 96-well plate (Waters, Cat#186003966).\nCondition the plate by adding 1 mL of SPE Buffer B (100% MeCN).\nWash out the MeCN by adding 1 mL of SPE buffer A.\nRepeat step 15 for a total of 3 times.\nLoad the pre-acidified samples, maximum volume 1 mL and run through Sep-Pak tC18 bed.\nWash by adding 1 mL of SPE buffer A (0.1% TFA).\nRepeat step 18 for a total of 3 washes.\nPause point: Peptides can be stored on the Sep-Pak at +4°C.\nPlace an empty sample collection plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific KingFisher, Cat#95040450) below the Sep-Pak tC18 plate. Elute peptides by adding 150 μL SPE buffer C (40% MeCN), followed by 150 μL of SPE Buffer D (60% MeCN).\nCritical: acetonitrile concentration > 60% can result in elution of contaminants and interference with downstream steps such as phosphopeptide enrichment.",
    "Note: to run each buffer through the packed Sep-Pak tC18 bed place in a 96-well extraction plate manifold adaptor (Waters, Cat#186001831) and apply vacuum as per manufacturer instructions. Alternatively, a swing-out rotor centrifuge (Multifuge X3, Thermo Scientific, Cat#75004500) with microplate adaptor (Thermo Scientific, Cat#75003795) can be used. In this case, spin the plates for 1 min at 500 g.\nPool the two eluates and dry using a SpeedVac concentrator at 45°C (1–4 h).\nCritical: if proceeding to phosphopeptide enrichment it is recommended to avoid complete peptide drying but rather reduce sample volume to ∼ 20 μL followed by dilution using phosphopeptide enrichment bind buffer (200 μL).\nTMT labeling\nTiming: 2 h\nNote: if performing LFQ data acquisition, proceed directly to phosphopeptide enrichment (step 37)\nCritical: it is important to randomize the samples in order to minimize labeling bias. Refer to Brenes et al.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] for indications of proper experiment allocation in a TMT setup.\nQuantify the peptides using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#ND-2000) at 280 nm to ensure equal peptide loading per TMT channel.\nRe-suspend TMT reagent stock (5 mg, Thermo Scientific, Cat#A44520) in 200 μL 100% MeCN.\nCritical: Aliquots of TMT reagents were stored dry at −80°C. Prior to labeling the peptides, the TMT reagents were resuspended in MeCN and stored on ice until use.\nCritical: Unlike in the manufacturer's protocol, HPLC grade acetonitrile and not anhydrous acetonitrile is used for the resuspension of the TMT tags and the dilution of the samples. The use of non-anhydrous acetonitrile hasn’t affected the performance of the labeling in this protocol.\nAdd HEPES (1 M, pH 8.0) to each sample to a final concentration of 100 mM and check that the pH is > 8. Add MeCN to a final concentration of 50%.",

Add enough Evotip buffer A to the bottom of the tray such that the bottoms of the Evotips are submerged and store at 4°C with the lid closed until analysis.\nCritical: Following phosphopeptide enrichment (step 42), the sample volume is > 200 μL. This can be directly loaded on Evotips but reduce the centrifuge speed (step 65) to 500 × g for 2 min, instead of the 800 × g for 1 min that is recommended for loading 20 μL of peptides.\nLC-MS/MS analysis\nCritical: To resolve the reporter ions using TMT, the minimum MS2 resolution required is 30k. We recommend to use 45k unless turbo TMT (11-plex) or turbo TMTpro (16-plex) is available.\nCritical: We recommend choosing the Evosep method and the MS method based on the input amount to be analyzed. The MS method parameters described below are for analysis on an Orbitrap Exploris 480 and may differ for other instruments.\nLC and gradients\nReplace Evosep One solvent as required (A: LC-MS grade H2O with 0.1% FA, B: LC-MS grade MeCN with 0.1% FA).\nSelect Evosep method and column based on input amount loaded into the column (Table 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl8]):\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2975_31.csv\nWhen using IonOpticks Aurora columns, use a Nanoflex source with a Sonation Column Oven PRSO-V2 (Sonation lab solutions, Cat#PRSO-V2) set at 50°C.",
    "When using Evosep performance columns, use an EasySpray source with an externally controlled Butterfly heater (MSWil, Cat#PST-ES-BPH-20) at 40°C. Problems 8 and 9.\nPlace Evotips in a 96 position Evotip rack in the order that they will be acquired on the mass spectrometer.\nCritical: when using Nanoflex source, adjust the emitter position so that it’s not too far (results in reduced and instable spray) or not too close (results in reduced spray) to the orifice.\nCritical: Before running Evosep Whisper methods, prepare fresh buffers, run a full solvent exchange, leak test, calibrate the pumps and do not move the Evosep system during the whole maintenance and sample acquisition.\nMS parameters\nSetup the mass spectrometer method for the Orbitrap Exploris 480 with the following parameters:\nPositive ion mode.\nSpray voltage at 1.8 kV with a silica emitter, 2.0 kV with a steel emitter.\nHeated capillary temperature at 275°C.\nFunnel RF level at 40.\nAcquire data in profile mode.\nNote: Data can also be acquired in centroid mode also. For 30K (or higher) MS2 resolution this is preferred.\nData-dependent acquisition (DDA) for TMT\nEdit the following parameters in a DDA method:\nSet full MS resolution at 60,000 at m/z 200 with a maximum injection time of 25 ms.\nSet the MS1 mass range at 350–1400 with an AGC target at 300%.\nSet the HCD fragment spectra resolution at 45,000 with a maximum injection time of 86 ms, using the Top10 method.\nNote: Using Turbo-TMT with a MS2 resolution of 15,000, we recommend a top12 method with a maximum injection time of 22 ms.\nSet AGC target value at 200% and the intensity threshold at 2e5.\nSet the isolation window at 1.3 m/z and the normalized collision energy at 35%.",
    "Critical: a higher collision energy of 35% is necessary to achieve efficient fragmentation of TMT reporter ions.\nData-independent acquisition (DIA) for LFQ\nEdit the following parameters in a DDA method:\nSet full MS resolution at 120,000 at m/z 200 with an injection time of 45 ms.\nSet the MS2 resolution at 45,000 with an injection time of 86 ms and an AGC target of 1000%.\nSet the HCD collision energy at 27%.\nSet the MS2 mass range at 472–1143.\nCritical: 17 windows of 39.5 m/z scanning from 472 to 1143 m/z with an overlap of 1 Da are recommended for DIA analysis on the Orbitrap Exploris 480 for phosphoproteomics samples. These settings result in a cycle time of 2 s However, alternative DIA window schemes may be optimized and applied. If the number of points per peak needs to be increased, the cycle time can be reduced to 1 s.\nData processing\nLFQ phosphopeptide enriched data processing using directDIA\nNote: Here we briefly describe the processing of DIA raw files using spectrum centric, also known as library-free approach using Spectronaut6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] directDIA workflow. Other software such as DIA-NN,7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] DIA-umpire8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] and PECAN9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] may be used for library-free DIA data processing.\nLaunch Spectronaut software.\nSelect the “Set-up DirectDIA Analysis from File” option.\nSelect the raw data files to be extracted.\nSelect the FASTA file for the library-free search. You can select more than one FASTA file (e.g., Human FASTA and contaminants).\nSelect the “BGS Phospho PTM Workflow” search parameters.\nNote: “BGS Phospho PTM Workflow” contains preset data extraction parameters necessary to process DIA raw data generated from phosphopeptide enriched samples (i.e.: phosphorylation on Ser, Thr and Tyr as variable modification). For non-enriched samples apply the “BGS Factory settings (default)” parameters.",
    "Note: The default “Probability cutoff” setting in the PTM workflow tab is 0.75. For a more confident localization of the phosphorylation site, you can increase this cut-off to 0.99.\nOptional: Specify the biological conditions in order to set the groups for statistical analysis post data extraction.\nOptional: Specify a Gene annotation file to add GO terms to the identified proteins post analysis.\nOptional: Select additional DDA or DIA raw data files generated from phosphopeptide enriched samples.\nNote: Preferably the DDA or DIA raw data should have been generated with similar chromatographic gradients, columns and mass spectrometry settings as the data being extracted.\nWhen the search is done, the report needs to be exported. Two strategies are available:\nExporting the site report generated from Spectronaut:\nClick in the Report tab. In the “PTM Site Report” (on the left), select the default pivot report (BSG Factory Report) and click on “Export Report”.\nCritical: The lack of protein grouping in this report will generate a table containing redundancy.\nExporting the custom-made table as described in the study by Martinez-Val et al.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] and collapsing it to obtain unique phosphosites using a Perseus plugin described in the study by Bekker-Jensen et al.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] available in GitHub (https://github.com/AlexHgO/Perseus_Plugin_Peptide_Collapse[href=https://github.com/AlexHgO/Perseus_Plugin_Peptide_Collapse]).\nTMT-labeled phosphopeptide data processing\nNote: Here we briefly describe the processing of DDA raw files using MaxQuant.\nLaunch MaxQuant software.\nLoad the raw files to be searched.\nIn the “Group-specific parameters” tab, select “Reporter ion MS2” as a type. Click on the TMT-plex used in the experiment. TMT-16 plex is available in MaxQuant from version 2.1.\nAdd Phospho(STY) as a variable modification.\nLoad the FASTA file in the “Global parameters” tab.\nIndicate the number of processors and start the search.",
    "When the search is done, open the Perseus software and load the Phospho (STY)Sites.txt table. Keep the default importation parameters. Set the reporter intensity columns as “Main”. The number of columns to import correspond to your number of raw file times the number of channels set up in the search times 3 (maximum multiplicity).\nClick on “Modifications” -> “Expand site table” to have table at the unique phosphosite level.\nFilter the table to remove reverse hit, contaminants. Only keep class 1 phosphosite by filtering the table based on the localization probability ( > 0.75).\nCritical: When searching several raw files, the localization probability added by default represents the maximal localization probability from any raw file."
