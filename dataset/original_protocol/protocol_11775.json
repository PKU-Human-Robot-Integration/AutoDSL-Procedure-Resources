    "1. Preparation of reagents\nNOTE: All steps in this protocol unless otherwise explained are carried out at room temperature.\nTo prepare a solution of 1x PBS-BSA (0.1% w/v), dissolve 1 mg of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) in 1 mL of PBS. To prepare a stock solution of Thrombin 1,000 units·mL-1, dissolve 1,000 units of Thrombin in 1 mL of PBS-BSA (0.1% w/v). Make aliquots of 10 µL and store at -20 °C for up to 4 months.\nTo prepare the culture medium for Drosophila brains, dissolve 1 g of Glucose in 1 L of Schneider’s medium in sterile conditions. Filter and store at 4 °C for up to 3 months.\nTo prepare the Fibrinogen solution, dissolve 10 mg of Fibrinogen in 1 mL of culture medium for 20 min at room temperature or 5 min at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: If a different culture medium than the one prepared at step 1.2 is used and Fibrin clots already form at this step, the culture medium likely contains active Thrombin, which needs to be inactivated beforehand. A likely source of Thrombin is Fetal Bovine Serum, which can be inactivated by heating the serum to 56 °C for 30 min.\nTo prepare a coating solution of PBS-BSA (5% w/v), dissolve 50 mg of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) in 1 mL of 1x PBS.\nFor the example reagent used in step 4, prepare a stock solution of 10 mM NAPP1 by dissolving 1 mg NAPP1 in 315 µL Dimethyl sulfoxide.\n2. Dissection of Drosophila larval brains\nNOTE: Perform this step under a dissection binocular.\nUse a brush to transfer L3 larvae into a 9-well borosilicate glass dish containing PBS. Stir to detach most of the fly food from the larvae and transfer to another well containing culture medium.",
    "Use forceps (e.g., Dumont #55) to grasp a larva across its entire diameter, in the middle of its body length (see Figure 1A,B). While holding the larva, transfer it to another well of the borosilicate plate containing 200 µL of fresh culture medium.\nDo not release the larva. To cut the larva in half across its entire diameter (Figure 1B), either grind the grasped area with lateral movement of the forceps tips (Figure 1A, top panel) or slide one tip of another pair of forceps between the two forcep tips holding the larva (Figure 1A, bottom panel). Do not cut the larva in half by pulling on one of its extremities, as it could damage the brain by pulling on it via the nerves crossing the body length (red lines in Figure 1B).\nUse forceps to hold the larva by its cuticle and another pair of forceps to peel apart the cuticle without pulling on the brain (Figure 1C). Repeat until the nerves originating from the brain are visible and the organs connecting the brain to the mouth parts can be accessed as shown in Figure 1D.\nUse forceps to hold the nerves originating from the brain. With the other pair of forceps, use either of the techniques shown in Figure 1A to cut the connection between the brain to the mouth parts, separating the brain from the rest of the cuticle (Figure 1D).\nUse forceps to hold the brain by the axons coming out of the ventral nerve cord. Pluck the organs depicted in gray in Figure 1E by gently pulling them away from the brain.",
    "NOTE: Do not pull on the eye/antenna imaginal disks (dark yellow) to detach them from the brain. The connection between these tissues is too robust to be broken by pulling without damaging the brain.\nWhile still grasping the nerves to hold and orient the brain, grasp the connection between the eye/antenna imaginal disks (dark yellow) and the brain with the other pair of forceps (Figure 1F). Use either of the techniques shown in Figure 1A to cut this connection without pulling on the brain. Check whether the brain is appropriately cleared of other tissues (Figure 1G) and not damaged (Figure 1H). Discard the brain if it shows signs of damage.\nPipette the coating solution with a P20 in and out to coat the pipette tip. Pipette the brain with the coated tip along with 3 µL of medium (Figure 2A, left) and pipette it out in another well containing 200 µL of clean culture medium.\nRepeat steps 2.2–2.8 until enough brains are dissected, occasionally replacing the culture medium of the well in which the dissections are performed.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61954/61954fig01.jpg",
    "Figure 1: Dissection of D. melanogaster larval brains. (A) Technique for cutting without pulling using forceps.

Immobilization on coverslip with Fibrin clots\nNOTE: Perform this step under a dissection binocular.\nUse a P20 pipette with a coated tip as in step 2.8 to transfer the dissected brains into another well of the borosilicate plate containing 200 µL of culture medium + Fibrinogen (Figure 2A).\nPipette in one brain along with 9 µL of culture medium + Fibrinogen. With the end of the tip almost touching the cover glass bottom of a 35 mm cell culture dish, pipette out the contents (the culture medium and the brain) making the culture medium touch the coverslip immediately after exiting the pipette tip so that the brain and the medium do not slide to the sides of the tip, potentially damaging the brain (Figure 2A).",
    "Use one tip of a pair of forceps or a closed pair of forceps to gently push and position the brain within the culture medium + Fibrinogen drop.\n\tNOTE: Touching the drop with an open pair of forceps can result in the culture medium getting pulled by capillarity between the forceps tips (Figure 2B).\nIf the ventral part of the brain has to be imaged, induce Fibrinogen clotting as follows to properly orient the brain within the clot (Figure 2C).\n\t\nPush the brain to one side of the drop. With a P1 pipette equipped with a P1 tip, pipette 1 µL of Thrombin solution, touch the edge of the drop on the opposite side of the brain with the pipette tip, and pipette out the Thrombin (Figure 2C, first drawing).\nWait for 1–2 min for the Fibrinogen to start polymerizing, resulting in the formation of a cloudy precipitate at one side of the drop (Figure 2C, second drawing). Gently push and “tuck” the brain into the Fibrin clot, making sure that the part to image (e.g., the ventral side) is as close as possible to the coverslip without deforming the brain (Figure 2C, third drawing).\nPipette out 1 µL of Thrombin solution close to the side of the brain not tucked into the Fibrin clot. (Figure 2C, fourth drawing).\nWait for 2–3 min for the second Fibrin clot to set (Figure 2C, fifth drawing). Press on the edges of the clot to make it adheres more strongly to the coverslip, taking care not to deform the brain (Figure 2C, sixth and seventh drawings). If the brain appears to be too far from the coverslip, bring it closer by pressing the Fibrin clot close to the brain.",
    "If the dorsal part of the brain must be imaged, induce Fibrin clotting as follows (Figure 2D).\n\t\nPosition the brain in the center of the drop, dorsal part facing the coverslip. With a P10 pipette equipped with a thin tip, pipette 1 µL of Thrombin solution, touch the edge of the drop on the opposite side of the brain with the pipette tip, and pipette out the Thrombin (Figure 2D, first drawing).\nWait for 2–3 min for the Fibrinogen to start polymerizing, resulting in the formation of a cloudy, fibrous precipitate (Figure 2D, second drawing). Press on the edges of the clot to make it adhere more strongly to the coverslip, taking care not to deform the brain (Figure 2D, third and fourth drawings).\nRepeat steps 3.1–3.5 if several clot samples have to be immobilized on the coverslip.\nWith the end of the tip positioned about 0.5 cm above the clot(s), gently pipette 390 µL of culture medium without Fibrinogen dropwise on top of the clot(s) (Figure 2B, right Petri dish). Do not add the culture medium on the sides of the clot as it may detach it from the coverslip.\nTo wash out the remaining Thrombin, use a pipette to remove 300 µl of the culture medium and add 300 µl of clean culture medium, making sure that the clots remain fully immersed. Repeat twice to wash out excess Thrombin.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61954/61954fig02.jpg",
    "Figure 2: Immobilization of a Drosophila larval brain using Fibrin clots. (A) Using a BSA-coated Pipette tip, brains are transferred from the culture medium (yellow) into a culture medium + Fibrinogen solution (orange), then pipetted onto the coverslip (light blue) of a culture dish along with 3.5 µL of culture medium + Fibrinogen. Fibrinogen clotting is induced by addition of Thrombin to immobilize brains in dorsal or ventral position (see D and E). The secured brains in the clots are subsequently covered in culture medium without Fibrinogen and excess thrombin is removed by adding and removing culture medium three times. (B) The position of the brain within the drop of culture medium + Fibrinogen (orange) on the coverslip should only be adjusted by gently pushing it with the tip of a closed pair of forceps, or only one forceps tip. Touching the drop with on open pair of forceps can result in the culture medium getting pulled by capillarity between the tips of the forceps. (C) Steps for positioning the larval brain for imaging the ventral side (see text). (D) Steps for positioning the larval brain for imaging the dorsal side (see text). In (D) and (E), green: Thrombin. Dark orange: Fibrin clot. Pale blue: coverslip. Blue arrows: edges of the clot to be pushed against the coverslip to stabilize the clot.

Addition of reagents during live imaging\nTo avoid temperature changes causing changes of focus, keep the solution with the reagents to be added to the culture dish at the same temperature as the culture dish itself to bring it to the same temperature before adding it. If an environmental chamber is being used, leave the solution within the chamber.",
    "Remove the lid of the culture dish without displacing the culture dish itself. For easier removal, place the lid of the 35 mm dish upside-down on top of the dish before imaging.\nWith a P1000 pipette, position the pipette tip close to the surface of the culture medium inside the culture dish and gently release the adequate volume of reagent solution onto it to reach the desired reagent concentration (e.g., 400 µL of a solution of 20 µM NAPP1 onto 400 µL of culture medium for a final concentration of 10 µM NAPP1), without generating strong fluxes that could detach the clots.\nTo homogenize the solution within the culture dish, use a P200 pipette to slowly pipette a small amount of the solution in and out five times (e.g., 150 µL for a volume of 800 µL within the dish).\nReplace the lid on top of the culture dish without displacing the culture dish itself and resume imaging.\n5. Washout of reagents during live imaging\nPrior to the washout, keep the washing solution at the same temperature as the culture dish.\nRemove the lid of the culture dish without displacing the culture dish itself.\nWith a P200 or P1000 pipette, slowly remove some culture medium from the culture dish without exposing the top of the clot (e.g., remove 600 µL from 800 µL of culture medium within the dish).\nTo dilute the reagent, with a P1000 pipette, position the pipette tip close to the surface of the culture medium inside the culture dish and slowly release the washing solution (e.g., add 1 mL of washing solution to the 200 µL of culture medium left within the dish for a dilution factor of 6).",
    "Repeat steps 5.3 and 5.4 until the reagent is diluted as required (e.g., another three similar rounds will result in a dilution factor of 1296, reducing the initial concentration of 10 µM NAPP1 to 7.7 nM).\nReplace the lid on top of the culture dish without displacing the culture dish itself and resume imaging.\n6. Correction of the xyz drifting on tridimensional and/or multichannel time-lapses\nPreparation\nDownload and install ImageJ24. Download the TurboReg25 and MultiStackReg26 plugins and place them inside the plugins folder of ImageJ.\nDownload the MultiHyperStackReg (Supplemental coding file 1) and AutoHyperStackReg ImageJ macros (Supplemental coding file 2). To install a macro, either place the .ijm file inside the plugins folder of ImageJ or add the contents of the .ijm file to the ImageJ/macros/StartupMacros.txt file.\nOn ImageJ, open a time-lapse movie including several slices and/or several channels (henceforth referred to as “hyperstack”, Figure 3A,4A). If the time-lapse only includes one slice and one channel, the alignment can directly be performed using MultiStackReg.\nCorrection of lateral drift using MultiHyperStackReg\nDecide which channel and/or slice of the hyperstack should be used as a reference for alignment. To generate a one-channel, one-slice reference stack (henceforth referred to as “reference stack”), click on Image | Duplicate…, tick the Duplicate hyperstack checkbox, type the relevant channel number in Channels (c): (e.g., replace 1–2 with 1) and/or the relevant channel number in Slices (z): (e.g., replace 1–15 with 8), and ensure that Frames: (t) includes all frames (e.g., 1–50) before clicking on OK (Figure 3B).",
    "Alternatively to step 6.2.1, if a projection of multiple slices is preferred for the one-channel, one-slice reference stack, click on Image | Stacks | Z Project…, select the first and last slices and type of projection, ensure that All time frames is ticked and click on OK. If the time-lapse has multiple channels either delete the irrelevant channels (Image | Stacks | Delete Slice) from the resulting projection or duplicate the chosen reference channel (Image | Duplicate) (Figure 3B).\nOptionally, crop the reference stack to use only one part as the image as a reference by selecting the rectangle tool in the toolbar, tracing a rectangle over the region of interest, and clicking on Image | Crop.\nTo start MultiStackReg, click on Plugins | Registration | MultiStackReg. In the pop-up menu Stack 1:, select the name of the one-channel, one-slice stack generated in the previous steps. In the pop-up menu Transformation:, select Translation; tick the Save Transformation File checkbox and ignore all the other fields.\n\t\tNOTE: Other types of Transformation (see25).\nClick on OK. Select a location and name to save the alignment file and click on Save. On the reference stack window, wait for the frames to stop moving automatically, indicating that the registration is over (Figure 3B).\nCheck on the reference stack to see whether the alignment is satisfying. If not, repeat steps 6.2.1–6.2.5 with a different reference slice, channel and/or cropping. Close the reference stack.\nSelect the hyperstack window and run the MultiHyperStackReg macro. Select the transformation file created in step 6.2.5 and click on Open. Wait for the alignment to be applied to every channel and/or slice of the hyperstack, at which point a new window with the suffix “_aligned” will open (Figure 3C).\nCorrection of focus drift using MultiHyperStackReg",
    "Click on Image | Properties…, copy the value displayed in Pixel Width. To orthogonally reslice the one-channel hyperstack with a one-pixel spacing, click on Image | Stacks | Reslice [/]…, paste the pixel width value into the Output Spacing: numeric field; select Top in the Start At: popup menu, tick Avoid Interpolation and click on OK.\n\t\tNOTE: In case memory has to be freed on ImageJ, the hyperstack can be closed following the reslice.\nSelect the new window generated by the reslice (henceforth referred to as “resliced hyperstack”, Figure 4B). If the resliced hyperstack has multiple channels, select a reference channel to perform the alignment and delete the other channels by selecting them in the channel scroll bar; click on Image | Stacks | Delete Slice, select Channel in the Delete Current popup menu and click on OK.\nGenerate a single-slice resliced hyperstack (henceforth referred to as “resliced reference stack”), either by duplicating a single slice of the resliced hyperstack (see step 6.2.1) or by projecting several slices of the resliced hyperstack (see step 6.2.2) (Figure 4C).\nOptionally, crop the resliced reference stack to use only one part as the image as a reference (see step 6.2.3).\nPerform the image registration on the resliced reference stack with MutiStackReg (see steps 6.2.4–6.2.6) (Figure 4C).\nSelect the resliced hyperstack window and run the MultiHyperStackReg macro. Select the transformation file created in step 6.3.5, click on Open and wait for the alignment to be applied to every channel and/or slice of the hyperstack, at which point a new window with the suffix “_aligned” will open (henceforth referred to as “resliced reference stack”, Figure 4D). Close the original resliced hyperstack.",
    "To convert the resliced aligned hyperstack to the xy view of the original hyperstack, click on Stacks | Reslice [/]…, select Top in the Start At: popup menu, tick Avoid Interpolation and click on OK. Once a new window with the final focus-aligned hyperstack opens (Figure 4E), close the resliced aligned hyperstack.\nTo automatically correct the lateral drift and focus drift, run the AutoHyperStackReg macro. Select the reference channel, if applicable, and whether to correct the lateral and/or focus drift.
