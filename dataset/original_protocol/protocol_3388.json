We recommend preparing proteasomes from 6 to 8 plates for one-time purification.\nPrepare 10 mL of Lysis buffer and 40 mL of washing buffer.\nHarvest cells.\nRemove all of the cell culture media from the 150-mm cell culture plates.\nAdd ∼10 mL of PBS onto the plate to completely remove media.\nRemove PBS from the plates.\nAdd 1 mL of ice-cold Lysis buffer per plate and immediately scrape the cells of the plates.\nTransfer detached cells to a 15-mL Dounce tissue grinder.\nNote: Cells collected with Lysis buffer from multiple culture dishes can be loaded in a grinder. But do not load more than ∼5 mL of buffer to avoid overflows.\nLyse the cells by gently moving the Dounce tissue grinder up and down about 15 times.\nTransfer the buffer which has lysed cells into multiple 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tubes, maximum 1 mL at a time.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 16,000× g for 15 min at 4°C.\nDuring centrifugation, wash streptavidin magnetic beads (BioMag Streptavidin).\nInsert the same number of new 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tubes into a magnetic rack.\nTransfer 100 μL of streptavidin magnetic beads (50% slurry) to each tube.\nAdd 1 mL of ice-cold Washing buffer to each tube.\nResuspend the magnetic beads after removing the tubes from the magnetic rack.",
    "Insert the tubes into the magnetic rack. After the beads are completely gathered onto the magnet, remove all the buffer.\nRepeat steps (c) – (e) two times.\nNote: Add the Washing buffer again as quickly as possible to prevent the beads from drying out, when the Washing buffer is removed during bead washing.\nNote: Streptavidin-agarose beads can also be used at proteasome purification (e.g. Streptavidin, agarose conjugate, Cat# 16–126, Merck). But for rapid and convenient purification, we recommend using streptavidin magnetic beads.\nAdd the supernatants from whole A549-PSMD14-HTBH cell lysates to the washed beads.\nIncubate tubes in tube rotator for overnight at 4°C.\nPrepare 40 mL of washing buffer, 10 mL of TEV washing buffer, and 5 mL of TEV protease buffer.\nRemove all the supernatant in the tubes and wash the streptavidin magnetic beads.\nAdd 1 mL of ice-cold Washing buffer to each tube.\nResuspend the magnetic beads after removing the tubes from the magnetic rack.\nInsert the tubes into the magnetic rack. After the beads are completely gathered onto the magnet, remove all the buffer.\nRepeat steps (a) – (c) two times.\nBriefly wash the streptavidin magnetic beads once with TEV washing buffer.\nAdd 500 μL of TEV protease buffer to the tube.\nIncubate the tubes for 2 h at 30°C in a water bath.\nNote: Gently invert the tubes every 30 minutes for resuspension. Prepare the same number of Amicon Ultra-0.5 centrifugal filter unit (top) that are placed into Amicon microcentrifuge tubes (bottom).\nInsert the tubes into the magnetic rack, and after beads are completely gathered onto the magnet, transfer the supernatants to Amicon filter units.\nCentrifuge the Amicon tubes with samples at 14,000× g for 15 min at 4°C.\nTo collect the samples, place the Amicon filter device upside down in a clean microcentrifuge tube.",
    "Centrifuge the tubes at 1,000× g for 2 min at 4°C.\nMeasure the concentration of collected purified proteasomes, for example, through BCA assay.\nNote: Concentration of purified proteasomes can be measured by a Bradford assay (e.g. Pierce Bradford Plus Protein Assay Reagent)\nNote: In assessing the purity and integrity of purified proteasomes, we commonly perform Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining in addition to Native PAGE analysis.\nIn-gel activity assay and immunoblotting of proteasome species\nTiming: 8 h\nThis process is to characterize purified mammalian proteasomes using native PAGE, which not only maintains the native structure and activity of proteasome species but also separates them based on size, such as the 20S proteasome alone, singly-capped RP-CP (26S proteasome), and doubly-capped RP2-CP (30S proteasome). These different proteasome species can be visualized by using fluorogenic peptide substrates, such as suc-LLVY-AMC as well as by subsequent immunoblotting.\nPrepare 200 mL of ice-cold Native gel running buffer.\nAssemble native gel (NuPAGE 3–8% Tris-Acetate Protein Gels) into an Invitrogen mini-gel tank.\nMake the samples by mixing purified proteasomes with 2× Native sample buffer (Novex Tris-Glycine Native Sample Buffer).\nNote: Do not boil the sample subjected to native PAGE.\nPour Native gel running buffer into the mini-gel tank. And wash each well of native gel using a 5-mL syringe.\nNote: Be sure to clean the wells of native gel to remove gel residues which may interrupt proper sample loading and gel running.\nLoad the 1–2 μg sample of purified proteasomes to a well.\nRun the samples for 4 h at 150 V at 4°C.\nPrepare 15 mL of In-gel activity assay buffer.\nTake the gel from the pre-cast cassette and place it in 15 mL of In-gel activity assay buffer.",
    "Note: When you separate the pre-cast gel, carefully open it since native gels are more easily torn than conventional denaturing gels.\nIncubate the gel in the In-gel activity assay buffer for 10 min at 37°C, protecting it from the light.\nAfter incubation, place the gel on a ChemiDoc imaging system (ChemiDoc MP Imaging System) and detect the AMC signal.\nTo prevent the gel from drying out, spray ddH2O before placing the gel on the ChemiDoc.\nPlace the gel on the ChemiDoc.\nSpray 3 mL of In-gel activity assay buffer evenly over the gel.\nThe AMC signal can be detected using the EtBr channel.\nAdjust the exposure time between 1 – 10 s to find the optimal images of 26S and 30S proteasomes.\nCritical: The excitation and emission wavelengths of suc-LLVY-AMC are ∼380 nm and 480 nm, respectively. When using another gel imaging system, use the channels in a similar wavelength range.\nCritical: Strong AMC signals will be observed from the 26S and 30S proteasomes, whereas little AMC signals from the free 20S proteasomes. To detect the AMC signal of the 20S after measuring 26S/30S proteasome activity, incubate the gel in 0.02% SDS in the In-gel activity assay buffer, which will open the pores of the 20S proteasome and increases the cleavage of the fluorogenic peptide substrates. Please refer the following protocols\nAdd 24 μL of 10% SDS (w/v, in ddH2O) to the remaining 12 mL of In-gel activity assay buffer.\nIncubate the gel for 10 min at 37°C, protecting it from the light.\nAfter incubation, place the gel on ChemiDoc (ChemiDoc MP Imaging System) and detect AMC signal again.\nTo prevent the gel from drying out, spray ddH2O before placing the gel on the ChemiDoc.\nPlace the gel on the ChemiDoc.",
    "Spray 3 mL of In-gel activity assay buffer containing 0.02% SDS evenly over the gel.\nThe AMC signal can be detected using the EtBr channel.\nAdjust the exposure time between 1 – 10 s to find the optimal image of 20S proteasomes.\nNote: For additional confirmation, we routinely perform subsequent immunoblotting with the native gel following the activity assay.\nAfter detecting the AMC signals, carefully wash the native gel with ddH2O.\nActivate the PVDF membrane (Millipore) by wetting it in absolute methanol for 10 min.\nAssemble the transfer cassette and transfer it in a mini-gel tank for 70 min at 100 V.\nBlock the PVDF membrane in 2% BSA in TBS-T solution.\nMake an antibody solution by diluting the antibody (for example, anti-PSMB6 and -PSMD4 antibodies) with a 2% BSA in TBS-T solution at 1:1000.\nNote: Other antibodies against the 20S and 19S subunits can be used for immunoblotting.\nBind the membrane with antibody cocktails and incubate it on a rocking shaker overnight at 4°C.\nWash the membrane with TBS-T solution for 10 min. Repeat this three times.\nMake an antibody solution by diluting the secondary antibody conjugated with HRP with a 2% BSA in TBS-T solution at 1:10000.\nBind the membrane with secondary antibody cocktails and incubate it on a rocking shaker for 1 h at RT.\nWash the membrane with TBS-T solution for 10 min. Repeat this three times.\nAfter incubation, place the membrane on a gel imaging system and spray ECL solution. Detect the chemiluminescence signal.\nProteasome activity assay using fluorogenic peptide substrates\nTiming: 2 h",
    "This process measures the activity of proteasomes using fluorogenic peptide substrates such as suc-LLVY-AMC. Because a microplate-based fluorometer is used, proteasome activity can be measured more precisely and quantitatively than in-gel activity assay. However, the suc-LLVY-AMC hydrolysis activity reflects both 20S and 26S/30S proteasomes. Their ratio in the purified proteasomes can be calculated by using a substance such as ATPrS that binds to the 26S and 30S proteasome and maintains its active state. To the contrary, high concentration of SDS (∼ 1%) inhibits the cleavage between the peptides and the AMC group, instead of activating the 20S proteasome.\nPrepare 15 mL of Proteasome activity assay buffer.\nNote: 15 mL of Proteasome activity assay buffer is enough for assaying one 96-well microplate.\nSet the fluorometer machine (Tecan infinite m200 fluorometer) in advance. We use Tecan Magellan 7.0 software according to the parameters below (Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3154_20.csv\nNote: We kinetically monitor proteasome activity by measuring the AMC signal for about an hour. Monitoring for a more extended period will not matter, but a shorter period measurement of AMC signals may result in insufficient observation.\nNote: This is a general protocol for measuring proteasome activity using Tecan Infinite m200 fluorometer. If you use different fluorometer, please refer to the manufacturer’s guideline and empirically optimize the measurement parameters in the table.\nAdd 8.33 μL of suc-LLVY-AMC (20 mM) to 12 mL of Proteasome activity assay buffer.\nNote: The concentration of suc-LLVY-AMC in Proteasome activity assay buffer can vary according to the samples, such as purified proteasomes and whole-cell lysates. Always prevent suc-LLVY-AMC from exposure to light until using it.\nPrepare the proteasome samples containing 20S, 26S, and 30S proteasomes by mixing it with Proteasome activity assay buffer which doesn’t have suc-LLVY-AMC at a final concentration of 100 nM.",
    "First, add 10 μL of proteasome samples to each well of the 96-well black bottom plate.\nNote: We usually put one sample into three individual wells. In addition, we use 10 μL of Proteasome activity assay buffer lacking suc-LLVY-AMC for normalization.\nDispense 90 μL of Proteasome activity assay buffer with suc-LLVY-AMC into wells containing samples. The concentration of LLVY-AMC becomes 12.5 μM.\nCritical: Dispense Proteasome activity assay buffer with suc-LLVY-AMC as quickly as possible because the reaction starts immediately as the buffer is added to proteasome samples.\nPlace the 96-well plate after loading on the fluorometer machine and start measuring proteasome activity.\nAfter the activity measurement is finished, save the file in an Excel format.\nAnalyze proteasomes through size-exclusion chromatography\nTiming: 7 h\nThese steps are to separate and analyze proteasomes using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). We can confirm changes in the 20S and 19S sub-complexes by immunoblotting with the fractions separated by the ÄKTA liquid chromatography machine.\nPrepare Size-exclusion chromatography buffer.\nBefore beginning the SEC, make sure the ÄKTA machine has been fully cleaned and the bubbles were removed from the pump, lines, and capillary loop.\nNote: All the solutions including ddH2O used in the ÄKTA machine should be filtered through a 0.2 μM membrane filter.\nConnect the Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL columns to the ÄKTA properly. In order to equilibrate the connected column with ddH2O followed by Size-exclusion chromatography buffer, put inlet A into filtered ddH2O and inlet B into the filtered Size-exclusion chromatography buffer.\nNote: Other size-exclusion chromatography columns that can separate the proteasome species from the 20S core particle (∼730 kDa) to the doubly-capped proteasome (∼2.6 MDa) can also be used.\nBefore injecting the sample, turn on Unicorn7 software and enter the protocol below (Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3154_21.csv",
    "Note: 1 column volume (CV) of the Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL column is 23.562 mL.\nUsing a 1 mL syringe, draw up the purified proteasome samples up to 1 mL. Invert the syringe and tap the syringe gently to remove bubbles and to prevent introducing gases into the ÄKTA.\nNote: Prepare more than 500 μg of purified proteasomes for SEC and subsequent biochemical analyses.\nNote: Make sure no bubbles remain inside the solution prior to sample injection.\nInject the sample into the capillary loop through the injection port.\nPrepare approximately 100 of 1.5-mL tubes and put them on the fractionation collector.\nCritical: If you do not intend to use the protein eluates immediately, add 50 μL of 50% glycerol into the tubes on the fractionation collector.\nAfter the fractionation starts, move the collected protein eluates to ice every 5 min.\nNote: If you do not analyze the fractionated samples immediately, snap-freeze them quickly with liquid nitrogen. Samples can be stored indefinitely at ‒80°C. We found thawing-refreezing cycles did not significantly impact proteasome integrity but decreased the number of interacting proteins.\nThe fractionated samples are subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting using various proteasome subunit antibodies.\nCritical: When conducting immunoblotting for the first time, test the fractions that correspond to multiples of 4 starting from the fraction where the protein peak increases on the UV detector. Once the fractions containing the proteasome species are identified, you may repeat the immunoblot analysis with narrower fraction intervals (for example, multiples of 2).\nSample preparation for mass spectrometry\nTiming: 2 days",
    "This step describes proteasome digestion with trypsin and sample clean-up for mass spectrometric analysis. Filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) is a method for successful bottom-up type proteomic analysis. Following the FASP step, peptides are cleaned up through a desalting process. The desalting step before MS is crucial because excess salt can interfere with peptide ionization and add the background signals in the mass spectra.\nProteasome digestion with trypsin.\nAdd Denaturation buffer to proteasome samples.
