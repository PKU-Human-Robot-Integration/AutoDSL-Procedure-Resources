    "1. Materials\nCheck that if all materials are available (Figure 1) before starting the following steps.\nThere are 3 sizes of neoprene caps, depending on the size of the subjects' head (small, medium and large). The cap has 27 holes representing EEG positions based on the 10/20 system: prefrontal (F8, AF8, Fp2, Fpz, Fp1, AF7, F7), frontal (F4, Fz, F3), central (C3, C1, Cz, C2, C4), parietal (P7, P3, Pz, P4, P8), temporal (T7, T8) and occipital (PO7, O1, Oz, O2, PO8).\nThe electrodes have 2 different uses; they can be used for the EEG (six channels) and for tDCS (two channels for sponge-electrodes, the anode and the cathode). In some circumstances, more than two sites of stimulation can be used. In this case four sponge-electrodes will be required and consequently, only 4 channels will remain for EEG recordings.\nThe variation of the tDCS electrodes size leads to a variation of focal effects 11. With a decrease of electrode dimension, a more focal stimulation can be achieved. On the other hand, by increasing electrode size it is possible to have a functionally ineffective electrode. The most commonly used proportions are 25 cm2 (5 cm x 5 cm) or 35 cm2 (5 cm x 7 cm). In this paper, sponge-electrodes of 25 cm2 will be used.\nAll the electrodes have to be connected to the Control Box device through the wires. This device has to be charged periodically using the Control Box Battery charger. For safety reasons, it is not possible to charge the Control Box during active stimulation.\nThe USB for Bluetooth connection is needed to pair the Control Box to the laptop/computer (see below).\n2. Skin Preparation\nInspect the skin for any pre-existing lesions - avoid electrical stimulation/EEG recording over damaged skin or over skull lesions.",
    "To increase conductance, move hair away from the site of electrical stimulation/EEG registering and place plastic hair clips to keep hair away, clean the surface of the skin to remove any signs of lotion, dirt, grease, etc. and allow it to dry.\n3. Head Measurements\nFind and mark the localization of the Vertex or Cz (Figure 2), by measuring the distance of nasion to inion and marking halfway using a skin marker 11.\n4. Electrodes Positioning in the Cap\nPut saline solution on the tDCS sponge-electrodes. The sponge-electrodes should be soaked with saline solution 11 before wearing the head cap. For a 25-35 cm2 sponge, approximately 6 ml of solution per side should suffice. It is important to periodically refill the sponge-electrode with saline solution in the case of a prolonged stimulation protocol.\nThe EEG and the tDCS electrodes have to be fixed in the cap before the subject is physically wearing it.\nFor further details on general tDCS electrodes preparation and positioning see 11.\n5. Wearing the Cap and Fixing the Control Box on it\nMake sure the subject is seated comfortably.\nPlace the cap in a way that the Vertex (measured on the head) matches the Cz point on the cap. Important: this is only valid for average size heads. Three different cap sizes are available, if necessary.\nFill the EEG electrodes with gel using a curved syringe.",
    "Connect EEG and tDCS electrodes to the Control Box wires. The Control Box has to be fixed to the posterior part of the cap. Use channels 1 and 2 for stimulation and the remaining ones (3 to 8) for EEG recording. Their position in the cap will depend on the desired experimental approach for both recording and stimulation (Table 1). As a demonstration, the classical left anodal tDCS set up will be displayed: anode = M1; cathode = Supraorbital contralateral. For this montage, connect the anode (red sponge-electrode) to the C3 and the cathode (black sponge-electrode) to Fp2.\nPut the reference electrodes to one of the mastoids making sure they do not touch one another and attached them to the wires (CMS, Common Mode Sense and DRL, Driven Right Leg) from the Control Box.\n6. Stimulation and Recording Set Up\nIn order to configure parameters of stimulation and check recording, the software needs to be properly installed according to the manufacturer's instruction.\nPress \"STIMULATION\" in the horizontal bar on upper screen (Figure 3).\nSelect the option \"EDIT\" in the upper screen and choose \"tDCS\" or \"sham\" out of other electrical stimulation techniques, such as \"transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)\" and \"transcranial random noise stimulation\" (tRNS) (Figure 3a). The details of such approaches is out of the scope of this paper and are better discussed elsewhere 12, 13.\nChoose the total duration of the electrical stimulation, usually 20 min (Figure 3b) and at intensity of 2mA. Note: the device is capable of stimulating electrically and recording EEG signals for up to 1 hr, if needed.\nChoose the electrode positioning according to channels (Figure 3c).",
    "Configure tDCS and EEG channels (Figure 3d) according to the experimental approach (Table 1). The reference electrodes are labeled as DRL and CMS. Be sure to select the right function for each channel. Important: label the active stimulation electrode as \"anode\" or \"cathode\" and its reference as \"return\" (Figure 3d).\nIn the bar menu located in the lower part of the screen choose the duration of the ramp down and ramp up period, usually 30 sec (Figure 3e). During this step you will also select the duration of pre- and post EEG recordings (Figure 3f). The EEG recording is not dependent on the stimulation and can be programmed to start before, during or after the end of the tDCS.\nTo check electrode impedance press \"STIMULATION\" in the upper part of the screen and then \"MOUNT\" in the left side of the screen and then \"START IMPEDANCE CHECK\" (Figure 4).\n7. Start the Device\nThe subject should be relaxed, comfortable and awake during the procedure.\nPress \"LAUNCH\" in the lower part of the screen (Figure 5a).\nCheck if the vertical gray bar is moving forward before (Figure 5b), during (5c) and after (5d) the tDCS.\nRe-check electrode impedances (Figure 5e).\nPress \"Abort\" to suspend the stimulation at any moment, if needed (Figure 5f).\n8. Record EEG Data\nPress \"EEG\" in the upper screen to check if the EEG signals are visible and without any artifacts (Figure 6, yellow bracket). The signals can be filtered from 2 to 15 Hz in order to clarify the EEG traces.\nEEG recording will start automatically as soon as the icon LAUNCH is pressed.\nDuring the stimulation the ongoing EEG can be checked in three different panels, localized at the vertical menu bar (Figure 6).",
    "Time domain (Figure 6): see the data as it is being received, choosing different time and voltage scales.\nSpectrum (Figure 7): select a channel and visualize the power spectrum online i.e. the screen shows the power of each EEG frequency by real-time Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis.\nSpectrogram (Figure 8): visualize the power spectrogram online by getting the information about the frequency content of the recorded EEG as a function of time (time-frequency analysis).\nIn any of the aforementioned options the researcher is able to filter the EEG activity (Figure 6, yellow rectangle) into specific frequency bands (Table 2). Most studies addressing the effects of tDCS on EEG activity have used this approach for data analysis (Table 3)."
