    "Sample preparation (Day 1)   Take up to 10 mg fresh tissue sample (approximate wet weight) or 5 mm diameter in size of algal culture (Beck et al., 1998) / lichen thallus in 2 ml tube (see Figure 2).   Add 2 steel balls in each tube.   Cover the open tubes with soft tissue paper.   Cool samples in -20 °C freezer for at least 6 h.   Fit the tubes in the lyophilizer and lyophilize overnight.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150802/20150802190650_6826.png Figure 2. Example of samples used for DNA extraction      Sample grinding and DNA isolation (Day 2)   Close the tubes.   Crash the lyophilized samples using the ball mill MM 400 at 30 Hz for 30 sec without buffer at ambient temperature.   Spin down for a few seconds the crashed sample before proceeding with DNA isolation.   For DNA isolation follow DNeasy 96 Plant Kit, Qiagen protocol (Plant Handbook 10/2012, http://www.qiagen.com, pages 31-34). Notes:    For buffers AW1 and AW2, before using for the first time, add the appropriate amount of ethanol as indicated on the bottle to obtain a working solution.   Preheat Buffer AP1 to 65 °C.     Elute the purified DNA from the DNeasy spin column using Buffer AE twice (2 x 50 μl).  Note: Smaller or larger elution volumes can be used for more or less concentrated products. To ensure complete elution, 40 μl should be the minimum elution volume.      DNA check   Prepare 1% agarose gel with 1x TAE buffer. Add 0.5 μl GelRed for 100 ml gel.   Load 2 μl DNA.   Add 1 kb or 100 bp ladder for reference.   Run the gel electrophoresis.   Check DNA for quality and quantity in gel doc system (Figure 3).    imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150802/20150802195450_1377.png Figure 3.",

Prepare a volume of reaction mix 10% greater than that required volume for the total number of reactions to be performed.   Mix the reaction mix thoroughly and dispense appropriate volumes into PCR tubes or plates.  Note: Mix gently by pipetting the reaction mix up and down a few times. It is not necessary to keep samples on ice during reaction setup.    Table 3.

    "PCR program   Step 1: 95 °C for 5 min (initial activation)   Step 2: 95 °C for 30 sec (denaturation)   Step 3: 62 °C for 90 sec (annealing)   Step 4: 72 °C for 60 sec (extension)   Step 5: go to step F2, repeat 24 times   Step 6: 60 °C for 30 min (final extension)    Store PCR products in -20 °C, until further processing.      Preparation of the plate for genotyping (Day 4)   Dilute the PCR products 1: 10 with RNAse-free water.   Combine 1 μl of diluted PCR product with a buffer containing 9 μl of a denaturing agent (Hi-Di™ Formamide) and 0.5 μl LIZ500 size standard.   Note: For one 96 well plate prepare buffer for 105 samples.    Centrifuge the plates briefly (5 sec) at 1,500 RCF.   Prepare table of samples.  Note: Fill any blank sample-well with nuclease-free water.    Analyze on an ABI3730xl.       Analysis (Day 5) Import the raw data files generated by the sequencer to the computer with GeneMapper software.  Genotyping in GeneMapper   Select ‘Create new project’ from the 'File' menu.   Import your samples.   Create marker panel and bin set. Analysis parameters   Choose ‘Microsatellite default’ as table setting and ‘Microsatellite analysis method’ as the analysis method.   Set the panel for the 7x-primer mix.   Set size standard as LIZ500 and exclude the 35- and 250-bp peaks.   Analyze (see Figure 4). Note: If some samples fail to match size standards, go to edit size standards and override size. If this does not solve the issue, there might be some problem with the sample or the analysis run.    imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150802/20150802193611_1311.png Figure 4.
