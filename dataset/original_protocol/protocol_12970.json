    "1. Assembly and Pretesting of the Morbidostat Device\nAssembly of the Morbidostat\n\t\nPunch 3 holes on the cap of the culture vial with an 18 G syringe needle. Cut three pieces of polyethylene tubing ~7 cm in length. Insert these three pieces of polyethylene tubing on the cap.\nUse tape to wrap the edge of the cap to serve as the cast for the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mixture. Mix 5 g of A component and 0.5 g of B component of the PDMS in a 150 ml plastic container by stirring manually with a toothpick. Load the mixture into a 10 ml syringe.\n\t\t\nPour the PDMS mixture on the cap with the syringe. Bake the entire cap to cure the PDMS for 8 hr in the oven at 70 °C.\nSolder the LED anode with the 24 gauge wire and LED cathode with the carbon resistor with a soldering iron. Solder a 680 Ω carbon resistor with a 24 G wire. Insulate the wire connection using electrical tape.\nSolder the collector of the photodetector with the 24 G wire and the emitter of the photodetector with a 100 kΩ carbon resistor. Insulate the wire connection using electrical tape.\nPlace the light emitting diode in the culture vial holder. By following the circuit diagram in Supplementary Figure 2, connect the light emitting diode and power it with a power supply of 5 V. Ensure that the LED works by using a digital camera that can detect IR (e.g., a mobile phone camera).\nPlace the photodetector in the culture vial holder. By following the circuit diagram in Supplementary Figure 2, connect the photodetector and power it with a power supply of 5 V. Connect the wire to both sides of the photodetector resistors to measure the voltage across the electronic control board.",
    "Glue a magnet on the shaft of the cooling fan, which serves as the magnetic stirrer unit. Note that the alignment of the shaft of the fan to the culture vial, and the spacing between the culture vial and the magnet is very critical for the proper function of the magnetic stirring unit.\nConnect each piece of polyethylene tubing of the culture vial into the corresponding piece of silicone tubing for the micro-pumps, medium bottles, and waste bottle. Turn on the pump for 1 hr and measure the total volume being pumped from the medium bottle to the culture vial to determine the pump rate. Note that the typical pumping rate should be ~4 ml/hr, which corresponds to the dilution rate D = 0.33 hr−1 for a 12 ml working volume of the culture vial.\nPlace the whole assembly on a mid-sized (34 cm x 34 cm x 43.5 cm) shaker incubator.\nPretesting the Morbidostat\n\t\nSet power supply voltage of cool fan to 5 V to start its motor to test the magnetic stirring bar. Note that the stirring action can be inspected visually. The voltage that drives the cooling fan motor is precisely controlled by pulse width modulation (PWM).\nPrepare a series of wild type E. coli samples with optical densities at 600 nm typically ranging from 0.07 to 0.3 for calibration. Place a test E. coli sample in the culture vial and record the photodetector voltage.\n\t\t\nPlace ~100 µl of the same sample in the plate reader and record the optical density. Use the photodetector voltage versus optical density data to plot the calibration curve. Note that typically, one unit change in optical density corresponds to ~7.6 V change in the photodetector with the bias scheme used here.\n2. Running the Morbidostat\nPreparation Before Starting the Daily Experiment",
    "Prepare the culture vial with three ultra-chemical resistant Tygon tubings with inner diameter 1/32 inch and outer diameter 3/32 inch for inlets to form the device as in section 1.1 and in Supplementary Figure 1.\nPrepare the M9 minimal medium (0.2% glucose) and trimethoprim (TMP) drug containing medium. Sterilize the medium, the medium bottle, the drug medium bottle, the waste bottle, and the culture vial in an autoclave at 121 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The TMP is a stock solution that is used to later achieve the concentrations in Table 1 and the TMP drug containing medium is not autoclaved.\nRunning the Morbidostat\n\t\nOn the first day of the experiment, thaw 1 ml of frozen wild type E. coli MG1655 cells for 5 min at room temperature and transfer 120 µl of the cells to the culture vial containing ~12 ml of M9 growth medium. After the first day, thaw 1 ml of frozen E. coli cells from the previous day for 5 min and transfer 120 µl of the cells to a new culture vial containing ~12 ml of M9 growth medium.\nTurn on the shaker incubator and set the temperature to 30 °C with no shaking.\nStart the morbidostat operation by turning on the micro-pump, the magnetic stirring unit, and the optical density measurement.\n\t\tNOTE: During the operation, a feedback threshold algorithm is used to control the drug injection. When the measured optical density exceeds a preset threshold, the drug injection pump would be turned on and the medium pump would be turned off. Otherwise, the drug injection pump remains off and the medium pump is on.\nMonitor the voltage from time to time to ensure there is microbial growth.",
    "Note: Because of the freeze and thaw cycle, E. coli cells exhibit a delay of ~4 hr during each day's growth.\nAfter ~23 hr, stop the micro-pump by turning off its supply voltage and take out the culture vial. Add 15% glycerol into the culture vial and freeze the sample at -80 °C for storage.\nRepeat steps 2.2.1 to 2.2.5.\n3. Antibiotic Susceptibility Measurement in 96 Well Format\nNOTE: Perform the growth rate measurement in a plate reader with a 96 well format to determine the antibiotic resistance level.\nThaw the daily frozen sample at room temperature for 5 min and transfer 15 µl of the cell to the culture vial containing ~15 ml M9 medium. Allow them to grow until the optical density at 600 nm reaches ~0.1. Divide the 15 ml into 1 ml bottles and add the TMP drug at this step to obtain the desired drug concentrations as shown in Table 1.\nTake 200 µl of the sample from step 3.1 and place into each well in the plate reader and allow them to grow for 12 hr5. The optical density at wavelength 600 nm is recorded automatically during the measurement.\n\tNOTE: For each data point, triplicate measurements are recorded and averaged to ensure the consistency of the data. The data on optical density versus time can be used to obtain the growth rate.\nPlot the growth rate data versus the drug concentration to obtain IC50. Note that IC50 is defined as the drug concentration at which the growth rate is fifty percent of the maximal growth rate5.\n4. Single Cell Morphology and Antibiotic Susceptibility Measurement in Microfluidic Devices\nPerform fabrication of the microfluidic devices via multilayer soft lithography from PDMS as described elsewhere15.",
    "Use photolithography to make the photoresist mold for the control and flow layers. Note that for the control layer, use negative photoresist (~15 µm height) and positive photoresist (~8 µm height) to produce a mold on a bare silicon wafer.\nPrepare PDMS mixtures with cross linking ratios of 5:1 and 20:1 for the control layer and the flow layer, respectively. Put the mixtures into a desiccator under vacuum to remove any bubbles, for 1 hr.\nExpose the control layer photoresist molds on silicon wafer to trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) vapor. Make the control layer of ~6 mm thickness by casting the PDMS mixture (with cross linking ratio 5:1) on the silicon wafer on the control layer photoresist mold. Bake the control layer for 40 min at 80 °C for 1 hr in the oven.\nMake the flow layer by spin coating a PDMS mixture (with cross linking ratio 20:1, spin speed 3,000 rpm for 60 sec) on a flow layer photoresist mold. Bake the flow layer for 30 min at 80 °C for 1 hr in the oven.\nUse a razor blade to cut the control layer into the desired chip size (typically 3 cm x 2 cm) and manually peel off the control layer. Place the control layer on top of the flow layer and align them under a stereomicroscope. Cure the aligned assembly at 80 °C in the oven overnight. Afterwards, soak the assembly in 250 ml of deionized water in a plastic container for 5 hr to dissolve the residual TMCS.\nSubsequently, punch the inlet holes with 20 G needles and bond the entire elastomer to a glass slide coated with a blank PDMS layer (PDMS cross linking ratio 5:1, spin speed 2,000 rpm for 30 sec) by air plasma treatment for 40 sec at 1.2 Torr air pressure.",
    "Carry out extensive baking for 36 hr at 80 °C to reduce the cytotoxic effects from PDMS. Note that this baking step is critical to minimize the toxicity to the bacterial cells.\nOn Chip Growth Experiment\n\t\nBefore loading into the microfluidic device, flush it with deionized water for 1 hr and M9 medium for 1 hr.\nThaw the daily frozen sample at room temperature for 5 min and inoculate a new test tube with fresh M9 medium. Place the sample in a shaker incubator at 37 °C overnight.\nDilute the microbial sample 10 fold with M9 medium and load it into the microfluidic device by pressuring the microbial sample container at 5 psi. Then load the TMP drug medium into the chip by pressuring the drug medium container at 5 psi. Execute the mixing between the microbe and drug by actuating the micromechanical valve between the two chambers on the microfluidic chip for 15 min.\nPlace the microfluidic chip in the microscope incubator mounted on the inverted microscope. Acquire the cell image in the growth chamber every hr for 8 hr with the CCD camera mounted on the inverted microscope.\nUse the custom program script to calculate the cell numbers through a threshold algorithm on the cell image data18. Note that the cell number data are averaged typically over three microfluidic chambers.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
