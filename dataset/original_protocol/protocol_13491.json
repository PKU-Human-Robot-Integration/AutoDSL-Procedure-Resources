    "All MRI scans utilizing OS-CMR with vasoactive breathing maneuvers should be performed in compliance with local institutional guidelines. The protocol outlined below has been used in studies approved by severalÂ institutional human research ethics committee. Written consent was obtained for all the human participant data and results described in this protocol and manuscript.\n1. Broad overview\nVary the inclusion and exclusion criteria depending on the study population of interest. Use the following general, common exclusion criteria for an OS-CMR with vasoactive breathing maneuvers protocol: general MRI contraindications (e.g., MRI-incompatible devices such as pacemakers or defibrillators, implanted material, or foreign bodies), consumption of caffeine or vasoactive medication in the 12 h prior to the MRI, and age <18 years.\nFirst, acquire the standard clinical localizer scout and ventricular structure and function images before acquiring the OS acquisitions. Use the bSSFP long-axis cine images to plan the slice positioning of the OS acquisitions.\n\tNOTE: A review of standardized clinical CMR protocols is described elsewhere39.\nBaseline breath-hold\n\t\nAcquire the first OS-CMR series as a short, baseline breath-hold acquisition to assess image quality and slice location, check for artifacts, as well as serve as a signal intensity baseline.\nPerform a short (~10 s), single cardiac cycle acquisition after the participant has been breathing normally. Ensure that the breath-hold is done on end-expiration.\nContinuous acquisition with vasoactive breathing maneuver\n\t\nAcquire the second OS-CMR series as a 4 min, continuous acquisition comprised of 2 min of free breathing and 1 min of paced hyperventilation, followed by a voluntary, maximal breath-hold (~1 min). As the continuous acquisition obtains multiple cardiac cycles over 4 min, modify one additional parameter (the number of cardiac cycles acquired by the acquisition) to make this series a repeated-measures acquisition",
    "NOTE: The minimum required breath-hold length is 30 s, although a breath-hold of 60 s is considered the standard.\nConvey the instructions for the vasoactive breathing maneuver to the participants in the MRI scanner by manually directing the participant throughout the breathing maneuver through a microphone connected to the MRI speaker system or through a prerecorded .mp3 file (Supplemental File 1) that can be played for the participant through the MRI speaker system.\nStart the vasoactive breathing maneuver with free breathing (after 120 s of free breathing, hyperventilation begins). Guide the participant through paced breathing with the use of audible beeps from a metronome at a frequency of 30 breaths/min (one beep indicates breathing in, one beep indicates breathing out). At the 55 s mark of hyperventilation, give a final voice command to \"take a deep breath in and then breathe out and hold your breath\" to ensure that the breath-hold is performed at an end-expiration level.\n\t\tNOTE: The change in blood CO2 is much more pronounced with the breath-hold at end-expiration (the lung surface is smaller, minimizing the residual diffusion of CO2 into the alveoli).\nImage analysis\n\t\nTo measure the B-MORE, consider the first end-systolic image during breath-hold as time 0 s. Compare the global or regional signal intensity values of the end-systolic image acquired closest to the 30 s time point of the breath-hold to the image signal intensity at the 0 s time point. Report BMORE as a percent change in signal intensity at 30 s compared to time 0 s of the breath-hold.\n2. Pre-scan procedure",
    "Ensure that every participant passes the MRI safety and compatibility questionnaire of the local institution (MRI General Contraindication form), which should include questions on past medical and surgical history and identify the presence of any implant, device, or metallic foreign body inside or at the surgical site of the participant40.\nObtain a pregnancy test, if applicable.\nVerify that the patient has abstained from vasoactive medication and caffeine in the 12 h prior to the MRI scan.\nShow the participant the instructional breathing maneuver video (Supplemental Video S1).\n\t\nPerform a practice session of 60 s of paced hyperventilation followed by a maximal voluntary breath-hold with every participant outside of the MRI scanning room and provide feedback on the performance of the hyperventilation.\nInstruct the participants that they can simply resume breathing when they have a strong urge to do so.\n\t\tNOTE: See the discussion for points to note and provide feedback on to the participants.\n3. MRI acquisition of oxygenation-sensitive sequences\nModify three parameters from the standard bSSFP sequence on the MRI console: increase repetition time (TR), increase echo time (TE), decrease flip angle (FA).\n\tNOTE: The modified values are dependent on THE MRI scanner field strength (Table 2). Increasing TR and TE and decreasing FA results in an increase in T2* or oxygenation sensitivity of the MRI sequence. These modifications will then result in an increase in bandwidth and base resolution of the sequence.\nCreate two OS series, a baseline (labeled: OS_base) and the continuous acquisition during which the breathing maneuver is performed (labeled: OS_cont_acq). Leave the baseline OS sequence unchanged. In the OS continuous acquisition, increase the repeated measures from 1 to ~25-40 (depending on scanner type). Increase the number of cardiac cycles (measures) until the acquisition time is ~4.5 min.",
    "NOTE: Two OS-CMR sequences are needed: OS baseline acquisition and OS continuous acquisition with vasoactive breathing maneuvers. The following sections describe these steps.\n4. OS baseline acquisition\nFor slice prescription, plan in an end-systolic still frame of a long axis view (two- or four-chamber image). Prescribe two short-axis slices-one at the mid-to-basal and the other at the mid-to-apical ventricular level. See the discussion for points to consider regarding slice location.\nSequence parameter adjustments\n\t\nAdjust the sequence parameters as needed for a given participant. See Table 3 for sequence parameters than can or cannot be changed.\nAdjust the average gap/spacing between slices based on the size of the participant's heart and ensure proper slice location.\nAdjust the field of view to avoid wrap artifacts if necessary. Make every effort to keep the field of view between 360 mm and 400 mm.\nShim volume\n\t\nAdjust the shim volume to be tight around the left ventricle in both the long- and short-axis views.\nSequence acquisition\n\t\nApprove the sequence and run it during the end-expiration breath-hold. Ensure that this baseline OS sequence lasts ~10 s, based on the heart rate and MRI scanner.\nImage quality check\n\t\nCheck both slices of the acquired series-look for any respiratory motion, poor slice location, or the presence of artifacts. Repeat the baseline OS sequence until adequate image quality has been obtained.\nFor troubleshooting, if the slice location is too basal or too apical, adjust the prescribed slice location to be closer to the mid-ventricular level. If there is an artifact present, follow the steps below:\n\t\nCheck the phase encoding direction.\nMake the field of view larger.\nAdjust the shim volume around the left ventricle.\n5. OS continuous acquisition with vasoactive breathing maneuvers",
    "NOTE: Ensure that every participant has been instructed about the proper performance of the breathing maneuver before they are in the MRI scanner (see section 2).\nSequence planning\n\t\nIf possible, copy slice position and adjust volume from the OS baseline image or duplicate the baseline OS sequence and, in repeated measurements, increase from 1 to ~25-40 (or close to 4.5 min acquisition time).\nVerify the image and slice positioning, and then capture cycle.\nIf possible, open the live stream window.\nIn the control room, plug a device with the breathing maneuver instructions .mp3 file into the auxiliary input or prepare to hold it over the microphone projecting into the MRI scanner. Alternatively, manually guide the participant through the breathing maneuver using a stopwatch for timing and verbally provide instructions through the microphone connected to the MRI speaker system.\nSequence acquisition\n\t\nSimultaneously press play for the OS Continuous Acquisition sequence on the MRI scanner and play for the .mp3 breathing instruction file or start the stopwatch if the participant is being manually instructed.\nIf manually guiding the participant through the breathing maneuvers, instruct them to breathe in and breathe out, then hold their breath for 10 seconds, and start hyperventilating as soon as they hear the metronome beep.\nNotify the participant at the 40 s mark of hyperventilation (2:40 on the stopwatch).\nAt the 55 s time point of hyperventilation (2:55 on the stopwatch), instruct the participant to \"take a deep breath in, breathe out, and hold your breath\".",
    "NOTE: The free breathing and hyperventilation images will have motion artifacts. This is expected. However, there should not be any motion artifacts during the breath-hold. It is critically important that the breath-held images are acquired after exhalation (comfortable end-expiratory position). Only a breath-hold after exhalation leads to the rapid increase of blood CO2 during the first 30 seconds of the subsequent breath-hold, with the associated change of coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygenation.\nMonitor the participant's performance of the paced hyperventilation through the control room window or MRI scanner camera to ensure adequate performance of deep breathing. If bellows are used, then monitor the amplitude peaks on the respiratory gating viewer. If hyperventilation is not being adequately performed after initial guidance, abort the acquisition and repeat the OS continuous acquisition sequence.\nMonitor for any small breaths taken by participants throughout the breath-hold. Do this by monitoring the tracing of a respiration belt on the MRI console or visually through the window/camera.\nOnce the participant starts breathing at the end of the breath-hold, stop the acquisition.\nAfter the end of the acquisition, ask the participant if they experienced any adverse effects and allow the participant to breathe normally for 3 min.\nTroubleshooting: repeat acquisition\n\t\nIf the breathing maneuvers need to be repeated, repeat the baseline OS sequence.\n\t\tNOTE: A period of 2-3 min before repeating the acquisition is required to allow the physiology to return to baseline. Previous data have shown that physiology does not return to baseline after 1 min41.\nIf the image quality of the OS baseline sequence is adequate, repeat the OS continuous acquisition and performance of the breathing maneuvers.\n6. Image analysis\nImport the OS-CMR image data sets into a DICOM viewer with image contouring capabilities, best with functionality to automatically analyze oxygenation-sensitive signal intensity changes.",
    "Markers and their measurement\n\t\nAcquire a baseline image during a short, baseline breath-hold acquisition before hyperventilation (rest). Compare the first image of the breath-hold (representing the end of the \"stress\" stimulus) to the baseline image.\n\t\tNOTE: Hyperventilation is a vasoconstrictive stimulus that reduces myocardial oxygenation (Healthy: %ÎSI ââ5% to â10%13).\nObtain many images (and cardiac cycles) during the breath-hold. Use the first image of the breath-hold as the baseline and compare all following images to this image.\n\t\tNOTE: Breath-hold is a vasodilating stimulus that increases myocardial oxygenation (%ÎSI â +5%-15%12,13,14,16).\nMyocardial contours\n\t\tFor manual analysis: cardiac phase selection\n\t\t\nAs the breath-hold can contain greater than 400 images, analyze only a single phase of each cardiac cycle. As a result, focus the analysis on the end-systolic images of each cardiac cycle.\nIdentify the end-systolic images of each cardiac cycle.\nDraw the epicardial and endocardial contours around the myocardium.\nWindow the image to look for artifacts, which will appear as either dark (susceptibility) or bright areas due to poor gating in the myocardium.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Avoid including pixels with partial volume effects from the left and right ventricular blood pools. Most contouring errors occur from the endocardial contour, including pixels with partial volume effects and resultant artificially elevated signal intensity from the left ventricular blood pool. To avoid this, draw the endocardial contour one full pixel inside the myocardium. Similarly, ensure that the epicardial contour is one full pixel inside the myocardium to avoid partial volume effects from the right ventricular blood pool, epicardial fat, or air-lung interface.\nCopy and paste the endocardial and epicardial contours from the first end-systolic image of the cardiac cycle to the end-systolic image of the next cardiac cycle. Adjust the contours as needed.\n\t\t\tFor automated analysis:",
    "NOTE: With automated contouring capabilities, if desired, all phases of the cardiac cycle can be contoured and analyzed.\nCheck all images to ensure accurate contouring.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Some commercially available automated contouring capabilities have been trained on data sets that were contoured for volumetric analysis. These contours are prone to partial volume effects as they are meant to border the blood pool and myocardium. OS-CMR contours must be fully inside of the myocardium.\n7. Segmentation for regional analysis\nTo obtain regional information, identify the anteroseptal and inferoseptal insertion of the right ventricle to divide the myocardium into American Heart Association (AHA) segmentation42.\n8.
