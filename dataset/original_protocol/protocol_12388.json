    "NOTE: All participants gave informed consent and the study was approved by the University of Birmingham Ethics Committee.\n1. Ask the participant to read the information sheet and complete the tDCS screeningquestionnaire (Appendix 1), and if there are no contraindications to performing tDCS, ask them to sign the consent form.\n2. Perform experiment one (calculation tasks) and experiment two (language tasks), one after the other, in pseudo-random order, before (session one) and after (session two) the stimulation period in a quiet room to reduce distractions and permit accurate recording of auditory response times, which are calculated off-line.\n3. In experiment one, present the auditory stimuli (i.e., numbers) over a headset (Table of Materials/Equipment). In experiment two, present the visual stimuli (i.e., words) on a computer screen. In both experiments, gate the headset microphone by the amplitude of participants' auditory responses.\nNOTE: All tasks were computerized and ran on a laptop computer controlled by stimulus presentation and recording software (Table of Materials/Equipment).\n4. At the end, explain to participants the purpose of the study (i.e., debrief), and ask them to rate the difficulty of each task on a scale of 1 (easy) – 10 (hard). Also, explain to participants not to take part in another brain stimulation experiment for at least 7 days, and to contact the experimenter if they should feel any adverse effects of tDCS.\n5. Experiment One (Calculation Tasks)\n5.1) Performing the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task\nNOTE: The PASAT comes in a 3 sec and a 2 sec version.",
    "Use the 60 items each contained in the 3 sec and 2 sec versions for the addition task and the subtraction task, respectively. Furthermore, use the items on the PASAT-Form A before the stimulation period (session one), and the items on the PASAT-Form B, after the stimulation period (session two).\n\tNOTE: Counterbalance the order in which participants perform the PASAT and the PASST, so that performance on one task does not transfer to the other.\nSit the participant in front of the computer screen and explain to them that they are going to hear a series of numbers through the headset, and that they will be required to add the number they hear to the number they heard immediately before it, and then vocalise the answer, and continue to add the number they hear to the one before it (and not to give a running total). Position the microphone in front of the participant’s mouth before starting the task.\nStart the task and ask the participant to read the standard instructions that are presented on the computer screen, which formally explains how to perform the PASAT. Carry out the task once the participant has fully understood the instructions.\n\tNOTE: A written example is also presented to them. These instructions are similar to those of the original version of the task.\nDuring the task, write down each answer on the printed score sheet (Appendix 2) for subsequent verification. Give no score if the participant provides an incorrect answer or fails to respond. Ensure that the stimuli are audible so that the task can be followed (alternatively present the experiment through loud speakers), and mark each correct answer in turn.",
    "Tell participants not to talk and/or perform oral calculations (or use fingers to assist performance) during the task and that only the answer should be spoken aloud.\n5.2) Performing the Paced Auditory Serial Subtraction Task\nTell participants that the instructions for the subtraction task (PASST) are the same for the addition task (PASAT), except this time they are required to subtract the number they hear from the number they heard immediately before it, and then vocalise the answer, and continue to subtract the number they hear from the one immediately before it (and not to give a running total). Again, make sure that the microphone has not moved away from the participant’s mouth.\nOnce the participant has read the instructions presented to them on the computer screen related to the subtraction task, and fully understood them – carry out the task. Again, remind participants not to perform calculations orally or with the aid of the fingers.\n5.3) Perforing the Practice Sessions (PASAT AND PASST)\nNOTE: A practice session is performed by each participant prior to carrying out each task in experiment one to determine the rate at which participants can perform the tasks within a certain limit to avoid ceiling effects. Achieve this by including 45 items during practice (opposed to the original 10 items).\nExplain to the participant that they are going to perform the PASAT and/or the PASST (depending on which task is to be performed first) as described above. During the practice session only, increase the presentation rate of the auditory items by reducing the inter-stimulus interval by 300 msec after every block of five items, between the interval range of 4.2-1.8 sec.",
    "During practice, note the presentation rate that caused the participant to make 3 consecutive errors (but allow them to finish the practice session), and use the rate preceding this cut-off point during the task.\nSelect the stimulus presentation rate for each participant, and maintain this rate between sessions one and two (i.e., before and after stimulation). Give the participant a short break between each task (approximately 30 sec).\n6. Experiement Two (Language Tasks)\n6.1) Performing the Verb Generation Task\nNOTE: Perform the noun reading, the verb generation and the verb reading task in this order (separated by a short break) so that the words presented in the verb reading task do not prime a quicker response in the verb generation task. Each task is made up of 3 practice words and 6 blocks of 10 trials.\nConstruct a list of 40 concrete nouns related to tools/objects that could be manipulated with the hands or feet, and 40 concrete verbs related to actions performed with the tools/objects from an independent group of participants whereby the same noun-verb pairs are generated by more than half the group as in Pope and Miall1. Avoid noun-verb pairs that generate the same responses (e.g., dinner-eat, apple-eat) or do not relate to human actions (e.g., oven-bake). Present half the words in session one and the other half in session two.\nExplain to the participant that they have to say an appropriate verb (e.g., drive) in response to the presented noun (e.g. car). Clarify this noun-verb relationship to participants at the beginning of the task.",
    "Present the words centrally on the computer screen in a different random order in blocks 1-5 (repeated words), and present new words in block 6 (novel words). Make sure each word is replaced by the next word when the microphone detects a response.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that the word lists in sessions one and two are different, and counterbalanced between participants.\nStart the task and ask the participant to read the standard instructions that are presented on the computer screen, which formally explains how to perform the verb generation task.\nOnce the participant has fully understood the task, position the microphone in front of the mouth, and instruct them to produce words as soon as they appear on the computer screen.\nWrite down or record each answer spoken aloud by the participant for subsequent verification. Make a note of any errors or missed responses.\n6.2) Performing the Noun and Verb Reading Tasks\nNOTE: Present the words in the same manner as in the verb generation task. Participants read nouns in the noun reading task, and verbs in the verb reading task.\nFor both reading tasks, instruct the participant to read each word aloud as soon as it appears on the computer screen.\nVerify that the participant has read each word correctly during both reading tasks by looking at the screen as words are being read aloud.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that the position of the microphone has not moved from the participant’s mouth in between tasks.\n7. Performing Cerebellar tDCS",
    "NOTE: TDCS is considered safe to use in humans. However, the researcher administering tDCS in this study was a first-aider. It is advisable that a first aider is at hand when performing tDCS, to ensure that the participants' safety is not compromised if they feel unwell/faint during the procedure. Never leave a participant unattended when administering tDCS.\nPresoak two sponge electrodes (surface area = 25 cm2) in a standard 0.9% NaCl saline solution until they are saturated.\nTo administer excitatory (anodal) stimulation over the right cerebellar cortex, place the red electrode, 1 cm under, and 4 cm to the right of the most prominent projection of the occipital bone (inion).\n\tNOTE: This lateral position on the scalp approximates the location of cerebellar lobule VII.\nTo complete the electrode montage, place the reference or cathodal electrode (blue) on the right shoulder over the deltoid muscle.\nTo administer inhibitory (cathodal) stimulation, repeat the above procedure and position the two sponge electrodes the other way round (i.e., place the blue electrode on the head and the red electrode on the shoulder).\nTo administer sham tDCS, deliver pseudo stimulation (e.g., 110 uA over 15 msec, every 550 msec) for 20 min instead of the stimulation current. Position the two electrodes the same as above, but counterbalance the position of the red and blue electrodes between participants in the sham group.\nSecure the wet electrodes firmly to the head and upper arm with rubber straps or self-adherent wrap. Place some paper towel around the back of the participant’s neck to mop up dripping saline solution.\n\tNOTE: Check that the intended position of the electrodes has not moved after they have been secured. To ensure optimal electrode-skin interface, make sure the electrodes are placed flat on the scalp, and not over the hair.",
    "To onset and offset each stimulation intervention increase and decrease, respectively, the DC current in a ramp-like manner over 10 sec38,39. Set the intensity of stimulation at 2 mA and deliver for 20 min using a reliable current-regulated DC stimulator (Table of Materials/Equipment).\n\tNOTE: This intensity is similar to that used by others25, and is considered a safe level of exposure40, well below the threshold for causing tissue damage41.\nTell the participant to rest/relax during the stimulation period, and discourage them from using electronic devices, so to avoid introducing confounding variables that may potentially influence the outcome of the experiment.\n\tNOTE: It is common for participants to feel a mild itching sensation at one or both electrode sites (and/or a metallic taste in the mouth) when the stimulation current begins. Reassure participants that these sensations disappear after a few seconds – leaving tDCS unperceived.\nApply anodal, cathodal or sham stimulation to three separate groups of participants in pseudo random order (between-participants, unrelated samples). Ensure that the overall number, gender and average age of participants is comparable between groups as in Pope and Miall1.\n8. Following brain stimulation, repeat the PASAT (steps 5.1-5.1.5) and the PASST (steps 5.2-5.2.2) in a counterbalance order, and the noun and verb reading tasks (steps 6.2-6.2.2) and the verb generation task (steps 6.1-6.1.6) in this order. Perform experiment one (calculation tasks) and experiment two (language tasks) in pseudo-random order. Do not provide practice on either task following brain stimuation.",
    "NOTE: In other studies of cognition, real and sham stimulation has been applied to the same cohort (within-participants, related samples), separated by a wash-out duration of at least 5-7 days25,26. However, differentiating sham and real stimulation is easier at higher current strengths42. This could be problematic in a within-participants design, but not so in a between-participants design as described here."
