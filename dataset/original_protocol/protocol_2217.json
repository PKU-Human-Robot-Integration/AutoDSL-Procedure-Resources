Mix well by pipetting. Incubate at RT for 5 min.",
    "Make a separate Mixture “B” for Thy1.1 or NGFR transfection each by mixing 125 μL of Opti-MEM™ with 2.5 μg of either Thy1.1- or NGFR-plasmid DNA into a separate 1.5 mL tube. Mix well by pipetting.\nCarefully pipette 125 μL of Mixture “A” into each Mixture “B” tube and mix well by pipetting. Now there should be two transfection mixtures: one for Thy1.1 transfection and one for NGFR transfection, each containing ∼250 μL.\nIncubate the transfection mixtures at RT for 18 min.\nHomogenize each transfection mixture by carefully pipetting up and down 3–5 times.\nUse a P200 pipette to evenly distribute each transfection mixture dropwise onto their corresponding well:\nDistribute the Thy1.1 transfection mixture onto Well #1: “Thy1.1 retrovirus”.\nDistribute the NGFR transfection mixture onto Well #2: “NGFR retrovirus”.\nGently swirl the plate to mix and incubate for 16–20 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nCulture medium change – Day 3.\nGently remove the transfection mixture-containing medium from each well.\nAdd 2 mL RT IMDM complete medium to each well.\nIncubate the transfected cells for a further 24 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nRetrovirus harvest – Day 4.\nAspirate the 2 mL of retrovirus-containing medium from each well into a 3 mL syringe and pass through a 0.45 μM syringe filter (we use the Thermofisher™ Millex-HV 0.45 μM Syringe Filter Unit) to remove large debris from the packaging cell line.\nAliquot 0.5 mL of the retrovirus-containing medium into a clean 1.5 mL tube on ice.\nEach 0.5 mL aliquot of retrovirus-containing medium is now ready to be used immediately for a single naïve CD4+ T-cell transduction (step 9).\nNote: Virus-containing tubes can be stored frozen at −80°C for later use (up to 6 months).",
    "Note: For best transduction efficiency, opt to use freshly harvested (never frozen) retrovirus-containing medium for naïve CD4+ T-cell transduction. This protocol assumes this recommendation is followed.\nNaïve CD4+ T cell isolation and activation – Day 3\nTiming: 5–6 h\nIn the following section, naïve CD4+ T cells are isolated from murine spleens. Cells are seeded onto a 24-well plate pre-coated with anti-hamster IgG, which will help spatially cluster the hamster anti-mouse CD3ε and anti-mouse CD28 antibodies to activate naïve T cells, as described in (Ciofani et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Ma et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). This system requires fewer antibodies for more effective T cell activation than direct coating with anti-CD3ε and anti-CD28.\nPre-coat 24-well plate.\nDilute anti-hamster IgG stock solution (1 mg/mL) at 1:20 with sterile PBS (1×).\nAdd 240 μL diluted anti-hamster IgG (0.05 mg/mL) to four wells of a 24-well plate.\nIncubate the plate for 2 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nAlternatives: The 24-well plate can be pre-coated in advance, sealed with parafilm (to prevent evaporation), and incubated at 4°C at least overnight for up to 1 week as needed.\nNaïve CD4+ T cell isolation and activation.\nEuthanize mice according to applicable IACUC guidelines. Here, we use RORγtWT and RORγtS182A cohoused littermates (one of each) of the same gender.\nTake the spleen from each mouse and place it onto a 40 μM cell strainer on top of a 6-well plate with 5 mL IMDM complete medium in each well.\nUse a plunger from a sterile 3 mL syringe to grind each spleen into a single cell suspension.\nTransfer the single-cell suspension to a 15 mL falcon tube and centrifuge at 650 × g for 5 min at 4°C to pellet splenic cells.",
    "Carefully remove the supernatant and add 1 mL ACK lysis buffer to each cell pellet to eliminate red blood cells. Mix well by pipetting and incubate at RT for 1 min.\nNote: Avoid incubating cells in ACK lysis buffer for longer than 1 min to prevent death of lymphocytes.\nAdd 9 mL MACS buffer to halt further cell lysis, and centrifuge at 650 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDecant supernatant. The cell pellet should appear white as an indication of successful red blood cell lysis and removal.\nProceed to purify naive CD4+ T cells from the cell pellet using the Naive CD4+ T Cell Isolation Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nNote: Each spleen should yield ∼2–10 × 106 naïve CD4+ T cells.\nWash the four precoated wells of the 24-well plate (from step 5) with 500 μL sterile PBS (1×) or IMDM medium.\nIn two wells each, seed 0.2–0.3 × 106 RORγtWT or RORγtS182A naïve CD4+ T cells in 500 μL IMDM complete medium together with anti-CD3ε and anti-CD28 at a final concentration of 0.25 μg/mL and 1 μg/mL, respectively.\nIncubate at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 24 h.\nNote: Compared to RPMI, IMDM showed better performance in inducing PMA/Ionomycin-mediated activation of CD4+ T cells (Zimmermann et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]). This media has been adopted by multiple recent T cell studies (Amir et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Ciofani et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Ma et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; Veldhoen et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]).\nNote: We omit the addition of IL-2 to the IMDM T-cell activation mixture as it was previously found to negatively impact the generation of Th17 cells in culture assays (Laurence et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Liao et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nRetroviral transduction – Day 4\nTiming: 2 h",
    "In this section, Thy1.1 or NGFR retroviral constructs are used to transduce, and label activated CD4+ T cells with Thy1.1 or NGFR surface markers.\nCritical: Transduction of activated CD4+ T cells occurs optimally during the mitotic phase of the cell cycle, which corresponds to 24–48 h post-anti-CD3ε and anti-CD28 stimulation.\nAdd 4 μg polybrene per aliquot to two 0.5 mL aliquots of Thy1.1 or NGFR retrovirus medium each (prepared in step 4). Mix well by pipetting.\nNote: If the retrovirus medium was previously frozen, it must be thawed on ice for 1–2 h before the addition of polybrene.\nGently remove the medium from all wells seeded with RORγtWT or RORγtS182A CD4+ T cells of the 24-well plate prepared in step 6.\nAdd a 0.5 mL aliquot of Thy1.1 retrovirus medium to one well of RORγtWT CD4+ T cells and one well of RORγtS182A CD4+ T cells each. Do the same for the NGFR retrovirus medium.\nSpin inoculates by centrifuging the plate at 900 × g for 90 min at 32°C with an acceleration rate of 3 and a deceleration rate of 1.\nCritical: Centrifugation at 32°C is crucial for transduction as previously described (Eremenko et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Pampusch et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nCritical: The retrovirus-containing plate should be sealed with plastic wrap before centrifugation to avoid the release of retroviral particles into the centrifuge.\nGently remove the plastic wrap (if used) from the plate and incubate overnight at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nEx vivo T cell co-culture and polarization – Days 5–8\nTiming: 4 days\nTransduced Thy1.1- or NGFR-expressing CD4+ T cells are co-cultured and polarized ex vivo as previously described (Ma et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nSetup CD4+ T cell co-culture – Day 5.",
    "Add 40 μL/well of diluted anti-hamster IgG (same as described in step 5) into two wells of a 96-well plate.\nIncubate the plate for 2 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nPrepare the T-cell polarization medium as outlined under “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]”.\nNote: The cytokine combination comprising the T-cell polarization medium was chosen to closely mimic the T lymphocyte populations observed in the intestinal lamina propria—namely a mixture of Th17 (Th17, RORγt+Foxp3-), RORγt+ Treg (RORγt+Foxp3+), and conventional Treg (cTreg, RORγt-Foxp3+) lineages (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). IL-6 and TGFβ alone—without the addition of anti-IFNγ and anti-IL-4—are sufficient to effectively polarize naïve CD4+ T cells toward the Th17 lineage (Bedoya et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). To induce concomitant polarization towards RORγt+ Treg and RORγt- cTreg lineages, we utilize TGFβ at 5 ng/mL, a dose known for polarizing naïve CD4+ T cells toward the Treg lineages in culture (Shevach et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). IL-1β (20 ng/mL) is used to mimic an inflammatory tissue environment, such as that of the colon post Dextran Sodium Sulfated (DSS) induced epithelial injury (Ma et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nAlternatives: Cytokine combinations/concentrations can be adjusted as desired to obtain polarization towards specific T-helper subsets.\nGently remove the retrovirus-containing medium from each well of the T-cell transduction plate from step 11.\nUse 0.5 mL T-cell polarization medium to resuspend transduced T-cells from each well by gentle pipetting and transfer to a fresh 1.5 mL tube.\nCount cells as described in step 1.g.\nAfter the 2-h incubation of the 96-well plate, remove the anti-hamster IgG solution and wash both pre-coated wells with 100 μL PBS or IMDM medium.\nSeed Thy1.1- and NGFR-expressing cells at a 1:1 ratio into both wells for a combined cell density of 0.08–0.12 × 106 cells per well (as illustrated in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]):",
    "Group #1: 100 μL NGFR-transduced RORγtWT T-cells + 100 μL Thy1.1-transduced RORγtS182A T-cells.\nGroup #2: 100 μL Thy1.1 transduced RORγtWT T-cells + 100 μL NGFR-transduced RORγtS182A T-cells.\nIncubate the plate for 48–72 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nNote: To avoid overgrowth if cells need to be cultured for longer than 72 h before restimulation, cells should be split into new pre-coated wells at a 1:2–1:4 ratio after 72 h.\nT-cell restimulation and FACS staining – Day 7 or 8.\nAdd restimulation cocktail (final concentrations: 5 ng/mL PMA, 500 ng/mL ionomycin, and 0.625 μL/mL GolgiStop) to each well. Mix well by pipette.\nIncubate for an additional 4–5 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1825-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Bottom: Representative flow cytometry plots from the small intestinal and colonic lamina propria (siLP and cLP), respectively. Lamina propria T lymphocyte populations were isolated as previously described by (Lefrancois and Lycke, 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Valle-Noguera et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). Note that IL-10 staining on ex vivo (top) and in vivo (bottom) samples was performed with clone JES5-16E3 (Alexa Fluor 488) and JES5-16E3 (Alexa Fluor 700), respectively.",
    "Note: For the following steps as part of the experiment illustrated in Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], we followed the manufacturer’s instructions suggested for the eBioscience™ Foxp3 / Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set.\nCentrifuge the cells at 600 × g for 5 min at 4°C and decant supernatant.\nWash the cells with 150 μL PBS 1×. Centrifuge and decant supernatant as before.\nAdd 40 μL of antibodies cocktail n°1 to each well to stain for surface markers. Mix well by pipetting.\nIncubate the cells for 30 min at 4°C in the dark.\nWash the cells with 150 μL MACS buffer. Centrifuge and decant supernatant as before.\nFix and permeabilize the surface-stained cells with 40 μL fixation/permeabilization solution (from eBioscience™ Foxp3 / Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set) for 30 min or overnight at 4°C in the dark.\nWash cells with 150 μL Permeabilization buffer 1× (from eBioscience™ Foxp3 / Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set) per well.\nCentrifuge the cells at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4°C and decant supernatant.\nRepeat step 13. i-j once.\nCritical: After cell fixation/permeabilization, the centrifugation speed should be increased to 1000 × g (from step 13. j onward) to avoid cell loss after decanting of supernatant.\nAdd 40 μL of antibodies cocktail n°2 to each well to stain for intracellular transcription factors/cytokines. Mix well by pipetting.\nCritical: To reduce the potential background of RORγt staining, ChromPure Rat IgG (1:50) should be included in antibodies cocktail n°2.\nIncubate the cells for 60 min at 4°C in the dark.\nWash cells with 150 μL Permeabilization buffer 1× per well.\nCentrifuge the cells at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4°C and decant supernatant.\nRepeat step 13. n-o once.\nResuspend cells in 100–200 μL of MACS Buffer or PBS 1× per well.",
