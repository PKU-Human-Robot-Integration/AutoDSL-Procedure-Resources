    "The research was performed in compliance with the institutional guidelines of the Medical Ethics Committee of Huaqiao University. The cerebral blood clots were surgically removed and collected at Quanzhou First Hospital, affiliated to Fujian Medical University, with informed consent from the patients.\n1. Blood clot pretreatment\nPlace the clots on a clean dish, add 5 mL of physiological saline with a tweezer, shake the dish gently, and remove the saline with a pipette.\n\tNOTE: Repeat the rinse three times.\nCut the clots into smaller pieces (smaller than 5 mm x 5 mm x 5 mm) with a scissor. Add 5 mL of physiological saline, shake the dish gently, and remove the saline with a pipette.\n\tNOTE: Repeat the rinse three times. Ensure no clot pieces are aspirated during the rinse.\nTransfer the clots to another clean U-plate.\n\t​NOTE: The protocol can be paused here (store the plate at 2-8 °C) and restarted later.\n2. Thrombolysis\nPrepare the sFE working solution by adjusting the concentration of sFE to 2000 U/mL with physiological saline.\n\tNOTE: The sFE was prepared according to the well-established protocols of Tang Lab15.\nAdd 300 µL of sFE working solution into the pretreated clots.\nPerform the first round of degradation.\n\t\nIncubate the mixture of sFE and clots at 37 °C for 0.5 h.\n\t\tNOTE: The blot treated with physiological saline was set as negative control. Do not rotate the sample on the shaker.\nMix the sample gently. Transfer the liquid part to another clean tube with a clean pipette.\n\t\tNOTE: The remaining clots were used for another round of degradation.\nCentrifuge the liquid part at 200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nTransfer the supernatant to another clean tube with a pipette to obtain the recovered sFE solution.",
    "Mix the cell precipitation with 50 µL of physiological saline gently.\n\t\tNOTE: The cell mixture was stored 2-8 °C for later use.\nPerform subsequent degradation.\n\t\nDegrade the remaining clots (step 2.3.2) with the recovered sFE solution (step 2.3.4) at 37 °C for 0.5 h.\n\t\tNOTE: The rest steps were the same as the first degradation round. The degradation process was finished until the whole clots were degraded.\nPerform cell collection.\n\t\nPrepare the blood cell sample by collecting the cell mixture of each round of degradation.\n3. Wright's staining\nPerform cell smear.\n\t\nAdjust cells to a density of 1 x 106 cells/mL.\nAdd 5 µL of the cells to the poly-L lysine-coated glass slide, then smear them using the cover slip.\nEvaporate the liquid at room temperature.\nPerform the staining.\n\t\nAdd 200 µL of Wright's dye (see Table of Materials) to the cell smear gently, and add 600 µL of Wright's dye B to mix evenly.  Stain for 10 min at room temperature.\nRinse the dye gently with clean water.\n\t\tNOTE: The stained cell smear can be stored at room temperature for later use.\nPerform microscopic imaging.\n\t\nExamine the stained cells using a light microscope (see Table of Materials).\n4. Routine blood examination\nAdjust cells to a density of 1 x 106 cells/mL.\nAnalyze the cell components such as platelets, erythrocytes, white blood cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and immature granulocytes using an autohematology analyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions (see Table of Materials).\nSubscription Required.
