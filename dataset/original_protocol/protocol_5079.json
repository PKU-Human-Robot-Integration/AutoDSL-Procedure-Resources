    "Preparation of plasmidsDilute the plasmids expressing the putative fusion proteins to 200 ng/µl with Tris-HCl pH 8.5 (see Recipes). Include a plasmid expressing an autofluorescent protein (e.g., GFP or mCherry) as a marker to facilitate evaluation of the assay. Here, a concentration of 100 ng/µl is sufficient.Note: The expression plasmids we use for our experiments are based on pcDNA3, a mammalian expression vector with constitutive transgene expression under control of the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early 1 promoter/enhancer complex and a neomycin-resistance pEGFP-N1 as marker to facilitate evaluation of the assay (Schröter et al., 2015). Preparation of cellsGrow rabbit kidney (RK13) cells in Eagle’s minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Trypsinize cells with ATV (Recipe 3) and seed ~1.8 x 105 cells per well onto 24-well cell culture dishes. On the following day, use cells for transfection. Cells should have a confluency of 80-90%.Note: Cell confluency for optimal transfection efficiency varies depending on the cell type. For RK13 and Vero cells 80-90% confluency is suggested. TransfectionPrepare DNA-mixture and Lipofectamine-mixture in separate tubes.DNA-mixture:Use 200 ng of each of the expression plasmids and dilute the DNA-mixture in 50 µl Opti-MEM. Lipofectamine-mixture:Use 1 µl Lipofectamine 2000TM in 50 µl Opti-MEM per well. Add Lipofectamine drop-wise to 50 µl Opti-MEM and mix gently. Incubate Lipofectamine-mixture for 5 min at room temperature.Note: The optimal amount of Lipofectamine varies depending on the cell type. For RK13 and Vero cells 1 µl per 24-well is suggested.Add Lipofectamine-mixture drop-wise into DNA-mixture, gently tap the solution and incubate for 20 min at room temperature (RT) (Video 1). Note: It is important to mix gently but thoroughly to allow formation of the DNA-lipid complex.    <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p>   Video 1. Tutorial: How to add Lipofectamine-mixture drop-wise to DNA-mixture  Remove media from the cells and add the transfection-solution drop-wise directly to the cell-monolayer (Video 2).",
    "Note: To allow equal distribution of the transfection-solution add it circularly drop-by-drop onto the monolayer (Video 2).    <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p>   Video 2. Tutorial: How to add transfection solution to the cell-monolayer  Add an additional 200 µl Opti-MEM to the cells to prevent drying of cells. Incubate cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 3 h.After 3 h, remove the transfection-solution from the cells and add fresh MEM supplemented with 2% FBS to the cells and incubate them 18-24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For an overview of the whole procedure see Figure 1.Note: To achieve comparable results, use exactly the same incubation time in each experiment before fixing the cells. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170301/20170301040120_2453.jpgFigure 1. Schematic presentation of the transfection procedureFixationPrepare 3% PFA (see Recipes).Remove media and wash cell monolayer for 2 min with ~1 ml PBS per well using a rocker at RT.Remove PBS and fix cells with 200 µl 3% PFA per well. Fix cells for 20 min at RT. Wash cells 2 x with 1 ml PBS per well. Add 1 ml PBS per well and store cells at 4 °C.Determination of fusion activityNote: To quantify fusion activity the number and the area of green-ﬂuorescing syncytia with three or more nuclei is measured using a Nikon Eclipse Ti-S ﬂuorescence microscope and Nikon NIS-Elements imaging software. Use fixed cells for determination of fusion activity by fluorescence microscopy.Open NIS-Elements imaging software (Nikon) and select corresponding type of fluorescence and objective (e.g., FITC, 10x) (see Figure 2 red boxes).Select Measure  Manual Measurement  Area (Figure 2A, Video 3).Note: NIS-Elements supports units including: pixels, nanometers, micrometers, millimeters, centimeters, decimeters, meters, inches, and mils. For our measurements we use micrometers.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170301/20170301035505_5899.jpgFigure 2. Example view of NIS Elements software. A.

    "Note: First, measure the area of syncytia on the right-hand corner of the screen, since each syncytium will be marked with a white icon on its right site, which can hinder the view over syncytia to the right of it (see Figure 2B). Measure all apparent syncytia in 10 fields of view (~5.5 mm2 each), each time starting in the top right-hand corner of the corresponding image. The data, including number of each syncytium as well as mean syncytia area will appear in a table on the lower right-hand corner (see Figure 2B green box, Video 3).    <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p>   Video 3. Tutorial: How to measure syncytia with NIS Elements software  Export the data directly to an Excel file or a text file by clicking the export options button (see Figure 3 red box). (Select whether to export the data to an Excel file or a text file.) You can modify the name and path of the file via the browse button. Repeat the entire experiment at least three times on three different days to calculate the relative fusion activity and corresponding standard deviations (SD)."
