    "NOTE: The protocol follows the animal care guidelines of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n1. Preparation of ACSF Solution\nPrepare ACSF solution as described in Table 1. Make 1 L in ddH2O (>18 MΩ purity), bringing osmolarity to ~300 mOsm/L with appropriate addition of water or NaCl.\n2. Equipment and Room Set Up\nThe equipment for monitoring of cocaine-induced locomotor behavior consists of behavior chambers (50 x 45 cm) wired with an inner light source, fan and camera (or infrared sensors), and fitted with an inner perspex box (30 x 30 cm) in which the mice are allowed to move freely while their locomotion is monitored. The behavioral testing should be performed between 1 hr after lights on to 1 hr before lights off, on a regular light/dark cycle. Animals should be trained consistently at the same time each day.\nConnect camera or infrared system to an appropriate system for monitoring and recording the locomotor behavior of the mice.\nClean the chambers after each trial with disinfectant provided by mouse facility and/or odor removing reagent, in order to prevent olfactory cue bias and to ensure proper disinfection.\nIMPORTANT: While handling the mice be quiet, calm and careful.\n3. Animal Preparation\nHouse 5 C57BL6 male mice (6-12 weeks old; ~25-35 g of weight) per cage, in a room with a 12 hr light/dark cycle and free access to food and water, according to standards and requirements of local Animal Care Committee guidance and protocols. Before initiating the experiment, weigh the mice and log the data. Cocaine is later administered according to the weight of the mice.\nTransfer all the cages containing mice into the behavioral room 30 min before starting the first trial.",
    "Habituate all of the mice used in the experiment to experimenter handling, injections and monitoring in the behavior setup. This is achieved by 3 consecutive daily intraperitoneal injections of 250 μl saline as described below.\nAdminister an intraperitoneal injection of 250 μl saline. Immediately following the injection, place the mouse in a behavior chamber to monitor locomotor activity for 15 min. Repeat this action for 3 consecutive days, at the same hour each day.\nOn the fourth day, divide the mice into two groups. Prepare a stock solution of cocaine at 2 mg/ml in saline. Administer a single injection of cocaine solution (final 20 mg/kg) to the experimental group according to the weight of the mouse (e.g. for a 25 g mouse – inject 250 μl, whereas a 30 g mouse will receive 300 μl). Administer saline to the control group. Immediately following the injection, place the mouse for 20 min in a behavior chamber for monitoring of locomotor activity (typically, the first 15 min are monitored).\nAfter the cocaine injection, sacrifice the mice at different time points (0, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 hr following injection). Importantly, make sure that reference mice (0 time point) will not receive any injection on this day. Due to its significance, it is imperative to include replicates of the reference group.\n4. Dissection of the Nucleus Accumbens\nAnesthetize the mice with isoflurane at the appropriate time after the cocaine/saline injection. The isoflurane must be directly vented out of the room. Therefore, the procedure should be performed in a chemical fume hood.",
    "Monitor the depth of anesthesia by testing the rear foot reflex. Pinch the paw to elicit a withdrawal response by the animal. An animal that shows a reflex is not at a surgical level of anesthesia and not in a state to euthanize.\nExtraction of the brain:\n\t\nEuthanize the mouse by decapitation.\nRemove the skin above the center of the skull and cut the skull with sharp scissors.\nInsert the scissors at the point where the spinal cord enters the brain (foramen magnum) and make two lateral cuts.\nFrom the same point, make a long sagittal cut along the sagittal suture. Upon reaching the olfactory bulb, clip to the left and to the right.\nWith a forceps, remove the skull carefully, grasping each half of the skull firmly and pulling to the side, taking care not to press onto or damage the brain.\nRemove the brain while severing the cranial nerves by using an inverted micro spoon spatula.\nPlace the brain in an ice-cold ACSF solution for 1-2 min to chill and harden.\nRemove brain from the ACSF, wick excess fluid with a paper towel, create a coronal cut between the cerebellum and the rest of the brain and glue the brain, with the rostral part facing up, onto the vibratome stage.\nCutting the NAc:\n\t\nMaintain ACSF solutions at ice-cold temperatures in the slicing chamber of the vibratome. Section at 200 μm until the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is clearly identified according to the Paxinos and Franklin Mouse Brain Atlas (approximately 1.8 mm anterior to Bregma; pay attention to the shape of the corpus callosum, the location and shape of the anterior commissure and the ventricles, as well as the overall morphology of the brain section). At this point, create two 400 μm sections, from which the NAc will be dissected.",
    "Under a stereoscope, use a fine blade to dissect the NAc area out from the slices. The definition of the NAc is according to the Paxinos and Franklin mouse brain atlas, and could conveniently be dissected in appropriate sections by four quick passes of the blade on the tissue. (Figure 2).\nPlace NAc sections immediately in 900 μl Trizol lysis reagent in a microcentrifuge tube and store at -80 °C until RNA extraction.\n5. RNA Extraction and cDNA Reverse Transcription\nThaw the tubes containing nucleus accumbens sections in trizol lysis reagent at room temperature and homogenize the lysate with a 1 ml syringe connected to 25 G needle until the tissue is completely homogenized (at least 15-20 times). The first few rounds are difficult, and require pushing the tissue against the wall of the tube in order to break it to small pieces that could enter the tip of the needle.\nTo ensure homogenization, pipet the lysate into a QIAshredder mini spin column and centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 1 min.\nPipet the lysate into new microcentrifuge tube and extract the RNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Store the RNA at -80 °C until use.\nMeasure the RNA concentration, analyze integrity and quality using a Bioanalyzer or equivalent equipment. Use 100-500 ng RNA for each round of cDNA preparation with random hexamer primers.\n6. Primer Design and Primer Testing\nChoosing good primers: For an optimal primer pair for qPCR of mRNA transcripts, follow these requirements (Figure 3):\n\t\nDesign primers containing no longer than 17-28 bases. Avoid nucleotide repeats as they promote mispriming.\nDesign primers with melting temperature (Tm) between 56-68°C (optimally 60-64°C). The Tm within the primer pair should be within 1 °C of each other.\nBe aware that the product size should ideally be between 80 and 150bp.",
    "Ensure that at least one of the primers covers an exon-exon junction, or the amplicon contains a large intron (intron-spanning), to avoid amplification of genomic DNA contaminants.\nUse a reliable software based on Primer3 (for examples see Table 2) in order to improve primer design.\nTesting the primers: In order to ensure the specificity and efficiency of the primers, a control qPCR reaction should be performed:\n\t\nUse a positive sample (containing cDNA template for all relevant primer pairs) and titrate the cDNA (e.g. eight three-fold dilutions from an initial concentration of ~10 ng) in duplicate parallel reactions. Include a no-template control, which controls for contamination within the solutions used for the reaction.\nCalculate primer efficiency by using the formula: (10(−1/slope)-1) × 100, such that the curve of the optimal slope is − 3.333 (i.e. 10(− 1/3.333) = 2) (Figure 4).\nDetermine the specificity of the amplification. Specific amplification is demonstrated by a single prominent peak common to all the melting curves of the amplified products, whereas off-target amplification would appear as an obvious deviation from the single large peak.\n7. qPCR Analysis\nPre-amplification:\n\t\nComprehensive qPCR analysis is based on parallel querying of limiting quantities of RNA with a large number of primer pairs. Therefore, a step of pre-amplification is essential. In this step, the cDNA undergoes 14-18 cycles of pre-amplification with a mixture of all the primers that will be utilized for querying the sample in the future (up to 800 primer pairs).\nDilute all primers in TE (low EDTA) to 50 μM for Specific Target Amplification (STA).\nPool together 1 μl aliquots of all of the 50 μM primer sets to be included in the STA reaction, up to 800 assays.",
    "Prepare pre-mix and samples for STA as described in Table 3. Allow for error by preparing mix for 110% of the number of samples that need to be amplified.  \nAliquot 3.75 μl STA pre-mix for each sample. Add 1.25 μl of cDNA to each.\nVortex to mix the reactions and centrifuge for 10 sec.\nPlace the STA reactions in a thermal cycler and cycle as indicated at Table 4.\nExonuclease I (ExoI) treatment:\n\t\nDilute the Exo I as indicated in Table 5.\nAdd 2 μl of diluted ExoI (4 U/μl) to each 5 μl STA reaction, vortex, spin down (>6,000 x g) and place in a thermal cycler at 37 °C for 30 min and then at 80 °C for 15 min.\nDilute the final products to an appropriate concentration for testing. Use TE Buffer (add 43 μl TE buffer to the 7 μl TSA sample).\nStore the diluted STA products at -20 °C or use immediately.\nPrimer and sample setup for qPCR:\n\t\nPrepare samples as shown in Table 6. Prepare mix according to the chip chosen for the experiment, and add samples as appropriate.\nAgitate the Sample Mix solutions for a minimum of 20 sec, and centrifuge (>6,000 x g) for at least 30 sec. Prepared reactions can be stored for short durations at 4 °C until the chip is ready for loading.\nPrepare the assays as described in Table 7.\nAgitate the Assay Mix for a minimum of 20 sec and centrifuge (>6,000 x g) for at least 30 sec to spin down all components.\n\t\tIMPORTANT: Vortex thoroughly and centrifuge all sample and assay solutions before pipetting into the chip inlets. Failure to do so may result in a decrease in data quality.",
    "NOTE: The final concentration of each primer is 5 μM in the inlet and 500 nM in the final reaction.\nPriming and Loading the Dynamic Array IFC (integrated fluidic circuit) chip. The IFC chip has inlets for samples and assays, as well as specified inlets (accumulators) for control line fluid (mineral oil) used to pressurize the microfluidic chambers (Figure 4A).\n\t\nInject control line fluid into each accumulator on the chip.\nRemove and discard the blue protective film from the bottom of the chip.\nPlace the chip into the appropriate IFC controller (controller MX for the 48.48 Dynamic Array IFC or the IFC controller HX for the 96.96 Dynamic Array IFC), then run the Prime (113x) script for the 48.48 Dynamic Array IFC or the Prime (136x) script for the 96.96 Dynamic Array IFC in order to prime the chip.\nWhen the script has finished, remove the primed chip from the IFC controller.\nPipette 5 μl of each Assay Mix and 5 μl of each Sample Mix into their inlets.\nReturn the chip to the IFC controller.\nUsing the IFC controller software, run the Load Mix (113x) script for the 48.48 Dynamic Array IFC) or Load Mix (136x) script for the 96.96 Dynamic Array IFC to load the samples and assays into the chip. When the Load Mix script has finished, remove the loaded chip from the IFC controller.\nLoad the chip on the thermal cycler, create a new chip run (according to manufacturer guidelines), including melting curve analysis. Using the thermal cycler software, ensure that the reaction chambers are recognized properly, and allow the reaction to run to completion.\n8. Data Analysis",
    "Quality assurance: In order to ensure data quality, verify the quality of the primers by addressing dilution curves (as described above). Monitor the specificity of amplification by viewing the melting curves of amplicons, the peaks of which should optimally be tightly aligned29.\nVisualization: For visualization of large quantities of data obtained by high-throughput qPCR, use software generated heatmaps, in which expression is color-coded by intensity. In addition, display the transcriptional dynamics of single genes as lined scatter plots.\nPublication: In publishing the gene expression results, it is advised to follow the MIQE Guidelines for publication of quantitative Real-Time PCR experiments, detailing the minimum information that must be reported for a qPCR experiment to ensure its relevance, accuracy, correct interpretation, and reproducibility.\nSubscription Required.
