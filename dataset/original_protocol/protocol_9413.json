    "1. Preparation of Reagents\nPrepare 1x Dissection Buffer using 128 mM NaCl, 4mM CaCl2, 4mM MgCl2, 2 mM KCl, 5mM HEPES and 36mM Sucrose. PH the solution to 7.2 and filter sterilize. \nPrepare the fixative using 1:1 dilution of 16% formaldehyde and 1x Dissection Buffer.\nPrepare 1x PBT using 1x Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) at a PH of 7.2 and Triton X-100 in a 1:100 ratio.\nPrepare 5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) with 0.01% Na Azide in 1x PBS.\n2. Preparation for the Dissection\nSylgard dishes are used for dissection. Prepare the dishes by pouring Sylgard 184 silicone elastomer base and curing agent mixture into a Petri dish. Allow the mixture to completely solidify and dry before using.\nBefore the dissection, gather a clean pair of #5 forceps, a clean pair of straight blade vannas scissors, and pins.\n3. Dissection of 3rd Instar Larvae\nCollect wandering 3rd instar larvae of a specific genotype onto a petri dish.\nWash the larvae in deionized water to get rid of the food.\nPlace a larva on the sylgard dish, with the dorsal side up. Pin the larva at its anterior and posterior ends.\nPlace a drop of 1x Dissection Buffer on the pinned larva. Using fine scissors nip the larva on the dorsal midline near the posterior end. Using the scissors, cut the larval cuticle from the posterior end through to the anterior end. \nPlace a drop of new 1x Dissection Buffer onto the dissected larva. Using a pin, pick one lateral edge of the cuticle near the middle of the larva and pin the cuticle. Using another pin, pin the second lateral edge of the cuticle as shown in the diagram. Two pins are used on each lateral side. See diagram below.",
    "Carefully remove the intestines, fat bodies, and trachea, leaving only the brain with the two optical lobes and ventral ganglia with the segmental nerves attached. The remainder of the procedure is done on the sylgard dish.\n4. Fixation of the Dissected Larva\nIncubate the dissected larva in fix for 30 minutes, by replacing the fix every 15 minutes.\nAfter fixation, rinse the larva in 1x PBT for 30 minutes by replacing the buffer every 10 minutes. It is important to note that the larva should always be in a buffer.\n5. Antibody Staining of the Dissected Larva\nPrepare the primary antibody by diluting it to the appropriate concentration in 5% BSA with Na Azide in 1x PBT. Optimal concentrations will differ for different antibodies.\nReplace the last 1x PBT rinse with the prepared primary antibody solution, and incubate in a humid chamber at 4°C overnight. The humid chamber is constructed by lining a plastic dish with kim-wipes soaked in water. \nThe following day, rinse the dissected larva in 1x PBT for 30 minutes by replacing the buffer every 10 minutes.\nPrepare the secondary antibody by diluting it to the appropriate concentration in 5% BSA with Na Azide in 1x PBT, and incubate the larva with the secondary antibody solution at 25°C for an hour. Wrap the humid chamber in foil to prevent light, as secondary antibodies are light sensitive.\nAfter incubation, rinse the larva in 1x PBT for 30 minutes by replacing the buffer every 10 minutes.\n6. Mounting and Visualization of the Dissected Larva\nBefore mounting the larva on the slide, prepare the slide by spreading two vertical lines of nail polish in the middle, with a space enough for a cover slip to sit on (see diagram). Let the nail polish dry completely.",
    "Place a drop of mounting buffer in the space between the vertical nail polish lines on the slide (see diagram). The slide is now ready for mounting.imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2128/2128.6.2.1.jpgimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2128/2128.6.2.2.jpg\nAfter the last 1x PBT rinse, gently remove the lateral pins. Be careful to not tear the cuticle.\nCarefully remove the two remaining pins and pick up the larva with forceps and place the larva horizontally on the prepared slide. Make sure the larva is not flipped over and is oriented ventral side up.\nGently place a cover slip on top and seal the edges with nail polish (see diagram). The larva is now ready for visualization under a fluorescent microscope.imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2128/2128.6.5.jpg\n7.
