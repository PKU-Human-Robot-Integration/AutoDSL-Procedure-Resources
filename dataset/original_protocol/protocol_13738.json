    "All animal studies were undertaken under the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Monash University. In this study, female Balb/c mice aged 6-8 weeks were used.\n1. Prepare cancer cells\nCulture tumor cells in medium. Culture 66cl4 murine mammary cancer cells in alpha-MEM containing 10% FBS and 200 mM glutamine. Cells should text negative for mycoplasma. OPTIONAL: Use cells that are stably transduced to express firefly luciferase for bioluminescence imaging to enable cancer recurrence monitoring after resection surgery11 (see step 4).\n\tNOTE: The cell line and the medium mentioned above were used in this study.\nGrow cells at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Passage cells aseptically in a hood at <80% confluency. Use low-passage cells in the logarithmic growth phase for optimal in vivo results.\nLift the adherent cells with 0.5 mg/mL of trypsin in PBS with 10 mM EDTA; 2 mL for a T75 flask. When lifted, add medium to inactivate trypsin, and wash the cells in PBS.\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer. Dilute the cells in PBS for injection. For 66cl4 mammary cancer cells, inject 1 x 105 cells in 20 μL of PBS per mouse.\nPlace the cells on ice prior to the injection.\n2. Generate a mouse model of breast cancer\nUse 4% isoflurane to anesthetize the mouse in an induction chamber. Then, maintain anesthesia with 2%-3% isoflurane using a nose cone. Confirm proper anesthetization by lack of response to toe pinch.\nPrepare the injection site by wiping the fourth left mammary fatpad area using a single-use alcohol swab.\nDraw up tumor cells (see step 1.4) into a 25 μL Hamilton syringe attached to a sterile 27 G hypodermic needle.",
    "Inject the cells into the fourth left mammary fatpad. Use forceps to secure and lift the skin. Inject approximately 1 mm from the nipple.\nOPTIONAL: If cells are tagged with luciferase, confirm successful injection of tumor cells by bioluminescence imaging. Inject 100 μL of 150 mg/kg D-luciferin into the lateral tail vein of the anesthetized mice using a 0.5 mL insulin syringe with a 30 G hypodermic needle.\nOPTIONAL: Place the mouse in a bioluminescence imaging system with the mammary fatpad facing up. Wait for 2 min from the luciferin injection for optimal tissue uptake of luciferin, then image for 10 s.\nPlace the mouse in a clean cage and allow it to recover from anesthesia.\nContinue to monitor animal welfare as per the institutional animal ethics guidelines.\n3. Induce stable anesthesia with intravenous delivery of propofol\nMonitor growth of the primary tumor using caliper measurement and calculate the tumor volume using the equation: Volume (mm3) = (length x (width)2 ÷ 2).\nPerform tumor resection surgery on mice when the primary tumor reaches the required volume (here, 80-90 mm3).\nSet up an automated syringe pump with a 30 G 1 mL insulin syringe containing propofol formulation (2% Lipuro propofol) (Figure 1A).\nInduce anesthesia of the mouse in an induction chamber with 3% sevoflurane or isoflurane.\n\tNOTE: Here, sevoflurane was used as this is the predominant volatile used clinically.\nTransfer the mouse to a 37 °C heating pad for the duration of the surgery. Briefly maintain anesthesia with 2%-3% sevoflurane using a nose cone.\nApply aqueous lubricant to the eyes to prevent drying. \nInject 0.05 mg/kg of buprenorphine subcutaneously for analgesia.\nTo prepare for surgery, shave the abdomen and prepare the skin for surgery with an iodine-povidone solution. Wipe the skin using an alcohol or sterile wipe.",
    "To deliver propofol-based TIVA, cannulate the lateral tail vein using a sterile 30 G hypodermic needle attached to a sterile polyurethane catheter. Confirm correct placement by blood flashback into the catheter (Figure 1B). Adjust the delivery of sevoflurane as required during intravenous cannulation to maintain a stable depth of anesthesia demonstrated by loss of corneal and pedal reflex, and respiratory rate < 100 breaths per min.\nCommence propofol-TIVA by administering 2% propofol as an initial bolus of 27 mg/kg for over 1 min. Cease sevoflurane administration.\nContinue the infusion of propofol at a maintenance rate of 2.2-4.0 mg/kg/min to maintain a stable depth of anesthesia for the duration of the surgery (Figure 1C).\n4. Resect the primary tumor\nMake a straight 1 cm incision inferior to the tumor in the region of the left fourth mammary fatpad. Carefully resect the tumor and the left inguinal lymph node using dissection with blunt forceps.\nOPTIONAL: If using luciferase-tagged tumor cells, use bioluminescence imaging to confirm clear surgical margins. Inject 150 mg/kg D-luciferin into the lateral tail vein, wait for 2 min, and then image for 60 s using a bioluminescence imaging system. If a residual tumor is identified, resect additional tissue from the mammary fatpad and re-image to achieve clear margins.\nEnsure hemostasis at the surgical site and close the skin using 5-0 nylon sutures. Ensure that the fur does not enter the surgical site.\nAt the conclusion of resection surgery, cease anesthesia. Place the mouse in a clean cage on a 37 °C heating pad and allow it to recover from anesthesia.\nMonitor every 15 min after anesthesia until the mouse has returned to normal alertness. Then, monitor the mouse every 12 h for 48 h after surgery.",
    "Administer 0.05 mg/kg of buprenorphine subcutaneously every 12 h for 48 h after surgery.\nAfter 7-10 days, remove sutures using sterile curved stitch cutters under brief sevoflurane or isoflurane anesthesia.\n5. Track cancer recurrence with in vivo imaging\nUse bioluminescence imaging to track cancer recurrence after resection surgery non-invasively. Use a bioluminescence imaging system to monitor the mice once per week for evidence of primary tumor recurrence or distant recurrence, commencing the week following surgery.\nInduce anesthesia of the mouse in an induction chamber with 4% isoflurane. Then, transfer the mouse to a 37 °C heating pad for the duration of anesthesia and maintain anesthesia with 2%-4% isoflurane using a nose cone.\nApply aqueous lubricant to the eyes to prevent drying.\nInject D-luciferin 150 mg/kg into the lateral tail vein. Wait for 2 min, then measure bioluminescence over a 60 s exposure to detect recurrence of the primary tumor or distant metastasis.\nIf the primary tumor recurs and becomes palpable, commence monitoring of tumor growth using caliper measurements.\nAt the end of the experiment, humanely kill the mice according to the approved protocol. Here, CO2 was used, followed by cervical dislocation.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
