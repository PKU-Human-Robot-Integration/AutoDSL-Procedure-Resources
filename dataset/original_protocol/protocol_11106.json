    "Patients have consented to this study following their admission under the Urology team at the Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Australia. This study was performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and within ethical and institutional guidelines (ethics number HREC/05/QPAH/95, QUT 1000001165).\nNOTE: As eligibility criteria, patients were aged ≥ 18 with cancer, and able to understand and provide consent. Those who were not able to give informed consent were excluded. Those having a primary language other than English were excluded as the provision of interpreters was not possible due to logistical and budgetary considerations. Also excluded were patients whose tumors were not accessible to biopsy or unlikely to be available in adequate amount after routine pathology.\n1. Organoid Medium Preparation\nNOTE: Human bladder cancer organoid medium requires growth factors that aid in the survival, growth, and continuous expansion of organoids derived from dissociated clinical material (Table 1). For complete details of each supplement used in this procedure, please refer to the Table of Materials.\nThaw frozen ingredients on ice or in a refrigerator at 2-8 °C. Avoid repeated freeze/thaw cycles and work from frozen aliquots (stored at -20 °C).\nBasal medium: Prepare basal medium by supplementing advanced Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium/Ham's F-12 (adDMEM/F12) with HEPES (10 mM) and glutamine (2 mM). This is also used as a transport medium, and during organoid washing steps.\n\tNOTE: Advanced DMEM/F-12 is used as the basal medium to aid in the expansion of organoids in the presence of limited serum; however, it requires supplementation with HEPES and L-glutamine.\nBriefly centrifuge fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF-10), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), epithelial growth factor (EGF), SB202190, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and A 83-01 before opening to ensure components are at the bottom of the vial.",
    "Complete organoid medium: Supplement basal medium with human noggin- and R-spondin 1-conditioned media at a final concentration of 5% v/v, human EGF (50 ng/mL), human FGF-2 (5 ng/mL), human FGF-10 (20 ng/mL), A 83-01 (500 nM), SB202190 (10 µM), B27 (1x), nicotinamide (10 mM), N-acetylcysteine (1.25 mM), Y-27632 (10 µM), PGE2 (1 µM) and a broad-spectrum antibiotic formation at the concentration indicated by the manufacturer.\nStore organoid media at 4 °C in the dark and use it within 2 weeks (1 month at most). Do not freeze. Avoid extended exposure to light sources.\n\tNOTE: The organoid medium is prepared serum-free; however, serum and penicillin/streptomycin could be supplemented on a user-to-user basis as required.\n2. A day before procedure outlined in 3\nThaw growth factor reduced basement membrane (BME; see Table of Materials) overnight for at least 12 h before use in a 4 °C refrigerator or cold room. If required, dispense BME into 1 mL aliquots in a 1.5 mL polypropylene single-use tube to avoid freeze-thaw cycles.\nPlace filtered pipette tips into a 4 °C refrigerator or cold room.\n\tNOTE: This section refers to pipette tips that will be used when handling BME to prevent premature polymerization and reduce the coating of BME on the surface of the tips.\nSterilize all surgical equipment required for the procedure.\n3. Generation of bladder tumor organoids\nNOTE: This is an initial step for PDO establishment from primary patient tumors. This procedure is adapted for bladder cancer tissues from methods established by Gao et al.24.\nUse a class II biohazard hood to prepare the specimen. Retrieve dry and wet ice and print Patient Specimen Processing Sheet (Supplemental File).\nCall research personnel to the operating room when surgical resection is near complete.",
    "NOTE: Confirm that the patient meets the eligibility criteria and has signed the participant consent form. Tissue is provided for research only if surplus to requirements for clinical histopathologic assessment.\nCollect a fresh macroscopically viable tumor specimen from surgery. Ensure that the sample is submerged in transport medium (either 1x adDMEM/F12 or 1x Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS)) in a sterile 50 mL conical tube or urine specimen jar during transit.\n\tNOTE: At some clinical centers, tissue may need to be transported to a pathology laboratory for to be allocated for research. Under these circumstances, it is recommended that antibiotics and antimycotics be added to the transport medium. Tissue can be stored at 4 °C in basal medium for up to 24 h post-surgery and still generate viable organoid cultures.\nRecord specimen details, including tissue weight (g or mg), sample description, and details regarding any blood and urine samples on the Patient Specimen Processing Sheet (Supplemental File).\nCarefully remove the transport medium and replace it with 10 mL of basal media. Allow the tumor tissue to settle by gravity.\n\tNOTE: Transport medium is considered as clinical waste and must be collected in an appropriately labeled waste container in an appropriate amount of decontamination solution. Once the liquid has been chemically decontaminated, it can be disposed of according to institutional guidelines for hazardous waste.\nRemove the tumor tissue with forceps and place it in a sterile 90 mm Petri dish (Figure 2A). Record the weight of the tissue in mg or g on the clinical specimen processing sheet and dissection grid (Figure 2B).",
    "Remove non-cancerous tissue (including adipose tissue) and macroscopically visible necrotic regions using sterile forceps and disposable scalpel blade mounted to scalpel handle (Figure 2C). Wash tumor pieces 1-2 times with cold 1x DPBS. Collect the tumor pieces and transfer them to a new sterile 90 mm Petri Dish.\n\tNOTE: As scalpel blades are sharp, take caution when manually slicing. Tumor-adjacent adipose tissue can be identified by distinctly soft, gelatinous, pale areas immediately adjacent to the visual tumor perimeter. Macroscopic adipose tissue, and focally dark regions representing areas of necrosis will require personal judgment when dissecting from an excisional bladder tumor biopsy.\nTake a photograph, draw a diagram of tissue, and plan tissue dissection on a clinical processing grid (Figure 2B and Figure 2C).\n\tNOTE: It is important to keep a visual record and rough sketch of the individual macroscopic tumor characteristics and dissection for each specific case.\nDissect tumor tissue pieces and allocate for histopathological (Figure 2D) and molecular analyses (Figure 2E).\n\t\nFor histological analyses: Place approximately 50 mg of tumor tissue into a labeled disposable plastic histology cassette (Figure 2D). Submerge histology cassette into a container with 5x to 10x volume of 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF). Incubate overnight at RT.\nRemove 10% NBF and replace with 70% (w/w) ethanol the next day for storage at 4 °C until tissue can be processed using routine tissue processing protocol\nFor molecular analyses: Snap freeze at least one 1-3 mm3 tumor piece in an RNase/DNase-free 1.5 mL cryovial using liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C (Figure 2E).\nDispense 5 mL of organoid medium (Table 1) in the 90 mm Petri dish containing the remaining tumor piece(s).\nMechanically mince tissue as finely as possible (0.5-1 mm3 pieces or smaller) with a sterile #10 scalpel blade.",
    "NOTE: Larger fragments or whole chunks of tissue (>3 mm3) will take considerably longer to digest and will decrease the viability of the specimen. Omit the above step if the tissue is disaggregated and fragments are small enough to pipette with a 5 mL serological pipette tip.\nTransfer finely minced tissue to a 50 mL conical tube and add 4 mL of organoid medium, 1 mL of 10x collagenase/hyaluronidase, and 0.1 mg/mL deoxyribonuclease 1 (DNase 1) to avoid cell clumping.\n\tNOTE: Enzyme solution should be freshly prepared each time. Increase the volume of the medium to be approximately 10x the visible amount of the tumor fragments for large samples.\nIncubate the minced tumor tissue and enzyme solution for 1-2 h on an orbital shaker or rotator (150 rpm) in an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) to dissociate fragments into a cell suspension and break down collagens. This can be checked with histological analysis (Figure 3A).\n\tNOTE: If the amount of tissue is large or no obvious dissociation is observed after 1-1.5 h, increase the incubation time checking the level of dissociation every 30 min. Timing for this step depends on the sample and must be determined empirically each time. A noticeably clearer solution with tissue fragments indiscernible to the eye (or very few fragments) indicates successful digestion.\nTerminate the digestion with the addition of 2x volume (20 mL) of basal medium to the sample.\nCentrifuge the sample at 261 x g for 5 min at room temperature (RT), aspirate, and discard the supernatant.\nTo lyse contaminating red blood cells (RBCs), resuspend the pellet obtained from the above step in 5 mL of ammonium-chloride-potassium (ACK) buffer. Incubate the tube at RT for 3 min or until the complete lysis of the RBCs is seen (suspension becomes clear).",
    "NOTE: If RBCs are not observed as a small red clump in the pellet, this step may be omitted.\nAdd 20 mL of the basal medium into the tube. Centrifuge the tube at 261 x g for 5 min at RT and aspirate the supernatant.\nAt this step, place a 10 mL aliquot of 2x and 1x organoid medium in a 37 °C water bath to warm.\nFilter the sample through a pre-wet reversible 100 µm strainer into a new 50 mL tube to remove large insoluble material.\n\tNOTE: Large undigested material (>100 µm) collected by the filter may contain cells of interest and can be cultured in 90 mm Petri dish or 6-well cell culture plate in organoid medium to derive 2D cultures (Figure 1 (step 5) and Figure 3B).\nFilter the eluate through a pre-wet reversible 37 µm strainer to collect single cells and small clusters for single-cell and immune cell isolation (Tube 37-1; Figure 1 (step 6) and Figure 3B).\n\tNOTE: The yield of tumor cells during this step may be increased by passing the filtered cell suspension through the strainer again.\nReverse the 37 µm strainer and use 10 mL of basal media to collect small and moderate-sized clusters (37-100 µm) (tube 70-1; Figure 3B).\nTop up each of the new 50 mL tubes (tubes 70-1 and 37-1) with DPBS to 40 mL. Centrifuge the suspension at 261 x g for 5 min at RT. Aspirate and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 10 mL of basal media to tube 37-1 and count the cells using trypan blue exclusion dye and an automated cell counter (as per the manufacturer's specifications). Determine the cell number and viability of cells.",
    "Centrifuge the remainder of the sample at 261 x g for 5 min at RT. Aspirate the medium and replace it with cell freezing solution or basal media containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).\nPlace samples in 1.5 mL cryovials and store them in a cell-freezing container. Immediately transfer the container to a -80 °C freezer for optimal rate of cooling. Following overnight freezer storage at -80 °C, transfer the cryovials into cryogenic liquid or air phase storage (-196 °C) for long-term storage.\nResuspend cells from tube 70-1 with 500 µL of pre-warmed 2x organoid medium.\n\tNOTE: Seeding density must be high for successful organoid propagation. The volume of the organoid medium and, subsequently, BME should be altered empirically on the number of cells isolated from the filtration step. This step provides a relevant starting point based on studies in our laboratory.\nAdd BME to cells (at a 1:1 ratio with 2x organoid medium) with ice-cold P1000 sterile filter pipette tips and mix gently to suspend cells. Quickly and carefully pipette 100 µL of reconstituted cells/ BME mixture to wells of an ultra-low attachment flat-bottom 96-well plate. Place the 96-well plate in an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 20-30 min to solidify.\nAdd 1:2 ratio of 1x organoid medium on top of BME cell suspension depending on the empirically assessed volume. In the relevant starting point, add 50 µL of 1x organoid medium media on top of 100 µL of reconstituted cells/ BME mixture.\nPlace the 96-well plate in an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 20 min to equilibrate.\nTake the cell culture plate out of the incubator and assemble it on a specimen holder on the stage of a microscope. Assess organoids visually under phase contrast or brightfield settings.",
    "NOTE: Images are best acquired by an inverted phase-contrast microscope equipped with differential interference (DIC) optics, digital camera, and associated software to observe the formation of spherical PDOs in preparation for endpoint analysis.\n\t\nIf distinct clusters are visible, place the cell culture plate into an onstage electronically heated microscope chamber (37 °C, 5% CO2) for live-cell imaging over the first 24-72 h.\nEnsure the flexible heated collar is attached to the lens to reduce thermal drift and the humidifier is filled with dH2O.\nPerform the initial imaging using a 4x or 10x objective lens (N.A. 0.30, W.D. 15.2 mm). Time-lapse every 5-10 min on the phase-contrast setting.\nCheck for the successful isolation as characterized by the appearance of >10 self-organizing organoids per well after a 24-72 h period.\nAllow cultures to continue for up to two weeks if organoid numbers are low (Figure 3C).\nTop up the medium every 2-3 days using 50 µL of pre-warmed organoid medium to replenish depleted growth factors and overall volume.\nAcquire images (as described in step 3.30) on days 1, 2, and 3 (time-lapse series), and on days 5, 7, and 10 before passaging (if applicable).\n\tNOTE: Organoids (observed as generally round structures where you cannot see the edges of individual cells) are typically passaged 7-10 days following setup, depending on the success of the isolation. Before or following passaging, organoids can be treated with cytotoxics or therapeutic agents for up to 6 days and drug response measured using cell viability and cytotoxicity assays. Alternatively, organoids can be retrieved from BME (using 1 mg/mL dispase) and cryopreserved (bio banked), prepared for molecular testing, or embedded and assessed histologically (Figure 4).\nSubscription Required.
