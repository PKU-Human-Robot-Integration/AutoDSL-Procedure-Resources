    "1. Animal Behavioral Model of PTSD\nSubjects: Male albino Sprague Dawley rats (Taconic Farms, Derwood, MD) are used, weighting 150 to 200 g at the time of administration of the stress protocol.\nMeasurement of food, water intake and body weight gain: On arrival in the laboratory rats weighing 100 ± 25 g are housed two to a cage (cage size: 45x24x20 cm). Cage padding substrate (woodchips) are changed twice weekly. Animals are maintained on a reversed 12-hr light cycle (lights on: 1800/0600 and off: 0600-1800) in a temperature (22 ± 4 °C)- and relative humidity (30-70%)-controlled environment one week before experiments. Water and standard pelleted chow (Harlan (2018) 18% protein Rodent diet, Global diets, Harlan Teklad) are freely available in the home cages, and bodyweights are recorded daily 3 days before, 3 days during and 3 days after the cessation of stress.\nAcclimation: Rats are acclimated for three days to both the animal facility and an acoustic startle chamber. To acclimate them to the acoustic startle chamber, animals are handled in it for 5 min each day for three consecutive days prior to the initial measurements.\nStressed protocol: The animals are equally assigned to each group based on their body weight and baseline startle response. Testing is done on two groups of animals; each group consisting of 16 animals. Group 1 receives the stress protocol, and Group 2 is the control.",
    "The stress exposure protocol is a continuous 2-hr procedure, where each session consists of restraint (\"inescapable\") and tail-shocks, repeated once a day over 3 consecutive days. Stressing is done in the morning (within the window of 0800 and 1200). Animals are restrained by being immobilized in a ventilated plexiglass tube. Forty electric shocks (2 mA, 3 sec duration; Animal Test Cage Grid Floor Shocker, Coulbourn Instruments, USA) are delivered to their tails at semi-random intervals of 150 to 210 sec (Graphic State Notation software, Habitest Universal Link, Coulbourn Instruments, USA). Stimulation at 2 mA was chosen because it is aversive, but not painful, when the stimulating output is placed across the experimenter's finger. Electrode gel is applied using Q-tip to form a thin layer of conducting gel between electrode and the skin of the rat's tail. The electrode clips are adjusted and connected to the tail to ensure a good connection without affecting the blood circulation of the tail.",
    "Acoustic Startle Response (ASR): Acoustic startle response measurement was conducted with a Startle Response Acoustic Test System (Coulbourn Instruments, Columbus, Ohio, USA) 3. This system consists of weight-sensitive platforms in a sound-attenuated chamber. The transducer, which is a strain gauge, in each of the startle platforms requires calibration before use. First, the coupler must be in the DC coupled mode for calibration. In this mode, the coupler's output directly follows the input from the platform, the mode required for calibration with static weights. The transducer is switched to the AC coupled mode during experiments so that only rapid change in force, which indicates startle response, is output. The animals' movements in response to sound stimuli are thus measured as a voltage change by a strain gauge inside each platform and recorded as the maximum response occurring within 200 ms of the onset of the startle-eliciting stimulus.\n There are six types of stimulus trials: 100 dB alone, 100 dB with pre-pulse, 110 dB alone, 110 dB with pre-pulse, pre-pulse alone and no stimulus control. Each trial type was presented eight times. Trial types are presented in random order to avoid order effects and habituation. Inter-trial intervals range randomly from 15 to 25 sec. Among the eight trials only the maximum values are collected in the results and finally adjusted with the animal body weight of the same day. Animals are tested one day before stress or other treatment as a baseline reading and 1, 7, 14 and 21 days following the final day of the consecutive 3 days of the stress procedure or other treatment.\nData analysis:",
    "ASR: The amplitude of acoustic startle response tested each time is represented as \"% of baseline\", which is calculated using the equation: % of baseline = (absolute amplitude /baseline absolute amplitude) ×100%. For each test day, ANOVAs for repeated measures are performed on startle amplitudes with factors of stress status and drug dosage using SPSS (Version 16) software. Tukey, Bonferroni, or Dunnett tests are used to assess significant post-hoc differences between individual groups. The data are represented as mean ± S.E.M.\nGrowth: Body weight and food and water consumption are measured on Day -1 preceding stress and on Days 14, 21 and 30 following completion of the stress protocol. Statistical analysis: Food and water intake data are subjected to one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). To analyze the changes in food consumption rate over time, the amount of food intake is further divided by the body weight of the subject to minimize the variance in body weight induced by the stress protocol and initial difference in the body weight between the groups. All procedures are conducted under the approval in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n2.

The atlas will still usually remain attached to the skull.\nBlood Collection: Squeeze rat at thorax to prevent blood from spurting from carotid arteries. Gradually relax grip so as to control the flow of blood into the collection container.\nRemoval of the Brain:\n \nQuickly cut muscle and any remaining vertebrae away from the basiocciput with the small scissor.\nUsing rongeur and beginning at the foramen magnum, cut away the occipital condyles and the basiocciput.\nMidline scalp incision with scalpel.\nUsing the scissors, cut a mid sagittal incision in the occipital and parietal bones. Grasping the cut margin of the skull with the rongeurs, break it back like an egg shell away from the midline, being careful to minimize any contact with the brain. The midline cut and break back may be done in stages.\nAs the brain is further exposed, it is critical to douse it with ice chilled aCSF to preserve the integrity and vitality of the tissue.\nSimilarly break away temporal and frontal bones.\nWith fine forceps, tear away the dura, making sure to get the tentorum cerebelli.\nWith mini spatula inserted under the frontal lobe raise the brain from the calvarium just enough to put tension on the cranial nerves.\nTransect the cranial nerves with the scissor.",
    "Lift the brain entirely from the skull and let drop into the beaker of iced low calcium / high magnesium aCSF.

The lateral cuts are lateral to the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, which is visible. We make the dorsal cut just above the third ventricle or ventral tegmental area (Figure 2H).\nPush spatula into the corpus callosum and pull away the small piece of isocortex attached to the hippocampus.

Representative Results\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3361/3361fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Rats are restrained and exposed to tail shock. Subsequent body weight, plasma corticosterone concentration, and acoustic startle response are measured.A: Stress Exposure: Animals are restrained by being immobilized in a ventilated plexiglass tube. Forty electric shocks (2 mA, 3 sec duration;) are delivered to their tails at semi-random intervals of 150 to 210 sec. B and C: Stress retards gain in body weight during growth: Body weight and food and water consumption are measured immediately prior to stress (Day -3), on the day of the three days of stress and then every other day there after up to Day 14. The lack of gain of body weight during stress is never compensated. D: Stress increases plasma corticosterone concentration. E: Acoustic Startle: Animals are tested one day before stress (day-1) as a baseline reading and 12 days following the final day of the consecutive 3 days of the stress. Data for each group - Stress and Control - are expressed as percent of acoustic startle on day 12 relative to day -1. Stress markedly increases the acoustic startle reflex.
