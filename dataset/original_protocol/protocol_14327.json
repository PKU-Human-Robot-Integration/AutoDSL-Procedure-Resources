  "procedures": [
    "This study was approved by the institutional Ethical Committee (Comissió de Bioètica, UB). The dissection procedures were carried out by an experienced anatomist, specifically trained in plane-by-plane dissection technique. This is an essential prerequisite to ensure a successful outcome of the experiment.\n1. Preparation\nSelect the specimens to be included in the study. Use below-the-knee cadaveric fresh-frozen human feet.\n\t\nExclude the following: any kind of deformities in the leg, ankle or foot (as this could affect the course of the nerves and ultimately affect the results of the study), ulcers, scars or evident signs of previous surgical procedures or any other condition that could difficult the localization of the nerves.\nSelect ten unpaired feet (five left and five right, amputated at the level of the distal tibia), from Caucasian fresh-frozen not exsanguinated specimens; the specimens included 5 men and 5 women with a median age of 80 (range, 53 - 95) years.\nDefrost the specimens by thawing them in room temperature tap water for 6-8 hours. Do not use hot water as it may alter properties of the specimens.\nPrepare the dissection field. Place the specimen upon a non-sterile surgical drape on the dissection table. Place the specimen in a stable position that permits a comfortable access to the dissection area; preferably, use a support that allows the specimen to be moved as needed.\nPrepare the dissection instruments to be used along with some gauze pads to clean the field during the dissection process.\n2. Dissection\nWith a scalpel, incise only the skin to create a window of approximately 20 cm x 5 cm at the medial part of the foot, oriented longitudinally. Start 15 cm proximal to the first metatarso-phalangeal joint, and end 5 cm distal, approximately.",
    "Dissect the skin without disrupting the subcutaneous tissue and avoiding any displacement of the nervous structures. Use fresh scalpel blades for each plane.\nPerform the incisions with the cutting edge of the scalpel facing out and not facing the specimen. This follows one of the principles of a plane-by-plane anatomical dissection of the skin. Use toothed forceps during this step to tightly hold the skin.\nRemove the skin covering the window area. Use gauze to clean the dissecting field if necessary.\nPerform a careful dissection of the subcutaneous tissue to identify the dorsomedial and dorsolateral nerves of the first toe. Use non-toothed forceps and new scalpel blades in order to avoid damage to the structures encountered. Iris scissors and periosteotome are helpful to progress in the dissection of the area where nerves are to be found (but are still not visible), as they allow a less aggressive dissection and prevent damage to the nerves.\nDissect at the proximal part of the window, to avoid inadvertently cutting the nerves. Identify the nerves without detaching from the inferior part of the subcutaneous tissue to prevent displacement. Once each nerve is identified, dissect through its course until the first metatarso-phalangeal joint.\nFixate the nerves in its original position with respect to the first metatarso-phalangeal joint, with a needle that will pierce both the nerve and the first metatarsophalangeal joint line.\nPerform manual traction of the first toe so the location of the joint line is made evident between the head of the first metatarsal and the base of the proximal phalanx of the first toe. The needle must puncture the nerve first and then be introduced into the metatarso-phalangeal joint. This step assures that the position of the nerve with respect to the joint will be stable throughout the study.\n3. Freezing",
    "Protect each specimen with bubble wrap and adhesive tape, to avoid cold burning. Take care during the wrapping process not to move the needles holding the nerves.\nTag each specimen appropriately.\nIntroduce the specimens into the freezer between -17 °C and -20 °C.\nWait for a minimum of 6 hours (or overnight) for the samples to freeze before performing the next step of the protocol.\n4. Sawing\nCheck the sawing equipment. Use a diamond saw with water cooling system.\nPrepare the working field where the specimens will be manipulated after the section.\nOpen the water flow and start the bandsaw rotation. Adjust the cutting speed of the saw and the water flow for refrigeration.\nOnce frozen, position the specimen on the saw board. Adjust the cutting line 1 cm posterior to the metatarso-phalangeal joint, as this is the point where the relevant surgical incisions are placed. Perform the section immediately after the specimen is removed from the freezer to avoid defrosting.\nSet the water flow to a minimum to protect the specimen from burning due to the friction of the bandsaw, while avoiding thawing the specimen by water and any subsequent alteration of the anatomical structures.\nOnce the first section is finished, Discard the anterior block of the specimen (that containing the toes).\nPerform a second section. Make a parallel cut, 1 cm posterior to the first one in order to obtain a 1 cm-thick block. This is the standard thickness, as thinner sections may cause the structures to move from their original path.\nDiscard the rest of the specimen or save for further studies. The specimens can be refrozen or fixed by immersion in fixative solutions.\n5. Measurements\nPlace the sectioned block flat on the working table and the goniometer flat on the surface of the cut specimen.",
    "Use a standard goniometer with its center located at the center of the first metatarsal diaphysis. Position one of the axis at the medial border of the extensor digitorum longus tendon, dorsally.\nMeasure the location of the dorsomedial and dorsolateral nerves of the first toe by using the second axis of the goniometer.\nExtrapolate the measurements to a clock model, in which the sphere is the contour of the first metatarsal diaphysis.\nSubscription Required.
