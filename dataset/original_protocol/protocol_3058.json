Notably, this step begins with enantiopure chiral ligands synthesized according to previous work (Zhang et al., 2022).1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2803-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Setup of Part 1\n(A) Reagents and material needed for the set-up, which includes HPLC grade acetonitrile, Zn(OTf)2, one 10 mL Syringe and one pressure tube.\n(B) Stir the mixture at 25°C for 5 min, affording a colorless solution.\n(C) Remove the solvent on a rotary evaporator.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2803-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Overview of purification of pentameric circular helicates\n(A) Filtration through a small pipette plugged with cotton wool.\n(B) Add ethyl acetate to precipitate the product as a white solid.\n(C) Centrifugation setup.\n(D) Centrifugated samples.\nSelf-assembly of pentameric circular helicates (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1].\nAssemble a 10 mL pressure tube with a stirring bar.\nWeigh 100 mg (0.11 mmol) chiral ligand.\nWeigh 42 mg (0.11 mmol) Zn(OTf)2.\nMeasure 5.3 mL HPLC grade CH3CN into the pressure tube.\nNote: Ensure that both starting materials were properly dissolved in the solvent. Make sure that none Zn(OTf)2 powder is stuck on the pressure tube wall, otherwise, add a few drops of CH3CN to rinse them into the reaction mixture.\nStir at 25°C for 5 min (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nRemove the solvent on a rotary evaporator to afford a pale-yellow solid (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nPurification of pentameric circular helicates (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nRedissolve the pale-yellow solid using the least amount of CH3CN as possible. , which is approximately 1mL in our case.\nFiltrate out anything that is insoluble through a small pipette plugged with cotton wool (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).",
    "Note: Any filtration setup will be suitable for this purpose. However, we prefer using a pipette plugged with cotton wool as it helps to minimize material wastage.\nAdd ∼60 mL ethyl acetate to precipitate the target product out (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nTransfer the suspension to four centrifugal tubes.\nCentrifuge the suspension at a 6000-rpm speed for 2 min (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C and 4D).\nDecant the solvent and dry the white powder on a rotary evaporator (40°C, 240 mm Hg, 10–15 min).\nConfirm the purity of the product by 1H NMR (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nPart 2: RCM of pentameric circular helicates to yield metallic knots\nTiming: 12 h\nIn this step, we describe the RCM reaction of pentameric circular helicates catalyzed by HG-2nd catalyst followed by a simple purification process without the use of column chromatography.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2803-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Setup for HG-2nd catalyzed RCM\n(A) Reagents and materials needed for the set-up, including degassed solvents, pentameric circular helicates, HG-2nd, one 10 mL pressure tube with an air-tight lid, and two 2 mL syringes.\n(B) Mix reaction reagents in the pressure tube, generating a green solution.\n(C) Run reaction, 110 W, 70°C, 10 h.\n(D) The crude mixture after 10 h’s microwave reaction.\nSetup for RCM reaction.\nIn one 10 mL pressure tube, place a stirring bar (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nWeigh 40 mg pentameric circular helicates (1eq.) and 13 mg HG-2nd (3 eq.).\nSeal the tube with an air-tight lid.\nPurge the tube with nitrogen gas for 10 min by attaching a nitrogen balloon and a short needle to release the pressure.\nNote: Schlenk line is provided to be an alternative way to perform gas purging.\nAdd 1.5 mL degassed anhydrous nitromethane and 1.5 mL 1,2-dichloroethane to the pressure tube using 2 mL syringes. (The degassing procedure can be found in the preparation part, Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).",
    "Place the pressure tube into the microwave reactor.\nRun reaction, 110 W, 70°C, 10 h (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nPurification of metallic pentafoil knots troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.3].\nAfter cooling the reaction to room temperature (20–25oC), remove the cap from the pressure tube with caution.\nNote: In a previously reported procedure8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] (Leigh et al., 2015), ethylvinyl ether was used to quench the HG-2nd catalyst. However, adding ethylvinyl ether to the reaction mixture followed by solvent removal resulted in a viscous crude mixture. In our experiences, we found that removing the solvent without adding any quench reagents did not affect the outcome.\nRemove the solvent on a rotary evaporator. (40°C, 240 mm Hg, 10–20 min).\nAdd 5 mL diethyl ether (1/1 v/v) to the resulting solid to remove any remaining catalyst.\nTransfer the suspension to centrifugal tubes.\nCentrifuge the suspension at a 6000-rpm speed for 2 min.\nDecant the solvent and collect the solid, and dry the powder on a rotary evaporator (40°C, 240 mm Hg, 15–20 min).\nConfirm the purity of the product by 1H NMR (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\nPart 3: Demetalation process to wholly organic 51 knots\nTiming: 4 h\nThis step presents the demetalation of the metallic pentafoil knots by Li2S and the purification of the wholly organic knots using the S-X1 Bio-Beads size exclusion column.\nDemetalation of metallic knots.\nAssemble a 50 mL round bottom flask (RBF) with a stirring bar.\nWeigh 50 mg metallic knots.\nAdd 10 mL DCM and 1 mL CH3CN.\nWeigh 10 mg (24 eq.) Li2S in a separate glass vial.\nAdd 10 mL H2O in the glass vial to dissolve Li2S.\nTransfer aqueous Li2S solution into the RBF.\nLeave the reaction stir vigorously at a speed of 1350 rpm at 25°C for 20 min.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2803-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Workup procedure for the demetalated molecular knots",
    "(A) Transfer the reaction mixture to a 100 mL separating funnel.\n(B) Collect the organic layer (bottom layer) into a 50 mL beaker and dry it with Na2SO4.\n(C) Filtrate through a funnel with cotton wool into a 100 mL pear-shaped flask.\n(D) Purification of wholly organic molecular knots by size exclusion column.\nNote: Li2S is a yellow, odorous, and toxic powder. All operations must be carried out in a well-ventilated fume hood. Gloves, goggles, and lab coats must be properly equipped to ensure safety. Also, make sure all glassware that was contaminated by Li2S must be thoroughly washed with bleach.\nPurification of wholly organic 51 knots troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.5], troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.7].\nAdd 20 mL DCM to the reaction mixture.\nTransfer the reaction mixture into a 100 mL separating funnel and perform phase separation (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nCollect the organic layer.\nWash the organic layer with 15 mL H2O twice.\nDry organic layer with Na2SO4 (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nFiltrate into a 100 mL flask using a funnel plugged with cotton wool.\nRemove the solvent under vacuum (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).\nRedissolve the foam-like product in the least amount of HPLC-graded DCM possible, which was approximately 0.7 mL in this case.\nAdd the sample to the size exclusion column and proceed with the separation eluting with HPLC-graded DCM (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D).\nNote: The concentration of the sample can have an impact on the separation process. Generally, higher concentrations and thinner layers of the sample on the column result in better separation.\nCollect 0.5–1 mL fraction in each test tube (2 mL).\nNote: The Bio-Beads column is typically used for gravity-flow chromatography, please do not walk away during the performance. To achieve better separation, it is recommended that the product is collected in as small a quantity as possible.",
    "Confirm the purity of each fraction from tube 1 to tube 10 by 1H NMR (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]).\nNote: Typically, the self-assembly of chiral ligands and RCM reaction both result in nearly quantitative yields. However, the demetallation step usually yields between 30%–40%."
