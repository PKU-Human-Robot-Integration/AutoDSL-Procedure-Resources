    "1. Apparatus\n1.1 Kondziela's inverted screen test\nThe inverted screen is a 43 cm square of wire mesh consisting of 12 mm squares of 1 mm diameter wire (Figure 1). It is surrounded by a 4 cm deep wooden beading (which prevents the occasional mouse which attempts to from climbing on to the other side) (Figure 2).\n1.2 Weights test\nSeven weights constitute the apparatus. Each consists of a ball of tangled fine gauge stainless steel wire, a \"scale collector\" as used to prevent limestone scale formation in domestic kettles. The weight of this is small (7 g) but each scale collector is attached to a series of steel chain links, each weighing approximately 13 g. The number of links ranges from one to seven. Their weights are therefore: 20, 33, 46, 59, 72, 85 and 98 g (Figures 3 and 4).\n2. Procedure\nFor all tests, bring the mice to the experimental room 5-20 min before testing to ensure they are properly awake. As a general rule, to allow recovery of muscular strength and a return to normal levels of arousal, rest the mice by a return to the home cage after each motor test.\nKondziela's inverted screen test\nProcedure: Place the mouse in the center of the wire mesh screen, start a stopclock, rotate the screen to an inverted position over 2 sec, with the mouse's head declining first. Hold the screen steadily 40-50 cm above a padded surface. Note the time when the mouse falls off, or remove it when the criterion time of 60 sec is reached. Longer criterion times may be useful for some experiments.\nScoring the inverted screen:\nFalling between 1-10 sec = 1\nFalling between 11-25 sec = 2\nFalling between 26-60 sec = 3\nFalling after 60 sec = 4",
    "Or, e.g. for 2 min:\nFalling between 1-10 sec = 1\nFalling between 11-25 sec = 2\nFalling between 26-60 sec = 3\nFalling between 61-90 sec = 4\nFalling after 90 sec = 5\n3. Weights Test\nHold a mouse by the middle/base of the tail and lower it to allow it to grasp the first weight (20 g) which is lying on the laboratory bench. As it grasps the wire scale collector with its forepaws, start a stop clock and raise the mouse until the link is clear of the bench. A hold of three seconds is the criterion. If the mouse drops the weight in less than 3 sec, note the time it held the weight. Rest the mouse for about 10 sec and try it on the weight once again. If it fails three times, that terminates the trial, and the mouse is assigned the maximum time/weight achieved. If it holds it for 3 sec then try it on the next heaviest weight. If it lifts this for 3 sec, test it on the next heavier weight, after you have tested all its cagemates on the first weight. Again, it is given three chances to hold the weight for 3 sec. A final total score is calculated as the product of the number of links in the heaviest chain held for the full 3 sec, multiplied by the time (sec) it is held. If the heaviest weight is dropped before 3 sec an appropriate intermediate value is calculated. Thus a mouse holding a 5-link weight for 3 seconds, but unable to lift a 6-link weight, is assigned a score of (5 x 3) = 15. If it holds the 6-link weight for 1 second, it scores (5 x 3) + (1) =16.",
    "Sometimes mice may not be adequately motivated to grip the apparatus. This generally occurs in older animals. This problem can be minimized by holding the mice by the tail for a longer time before bringing it within gripping distance of the wire ball."
