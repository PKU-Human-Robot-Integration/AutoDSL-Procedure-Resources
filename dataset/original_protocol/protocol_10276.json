    "1. Preparation of Bamboo Hydrolysate\nAdd 5 g of bamboo powder to 40 mL of an NaOH solution to achieve a 10% (g/g) final concentration in a 250 mL flask. Use a series of NaOH solutions ranging from 0.05 M to 0.50 M in increments of 0.05 M.\nIncubate the mixture for 60 min at 60 °C or 100 °C in a water bath. Incubate at 121 °C in an autoclave.\nAfter incubation, leave the mixture to stand for 4 h at room temperature. Then, remove the supernatant. Add 100 mL of fresh water and mix.\nRepeat this washing 5-6 times, until the pH of the supernatant reaches 6.8. Use the obtained solid for the next step of enzymatic hydrolysis.\nFor hydrolysis, adjust 50 mL of the above mixture to pH 5.0 using 98% H2SO4. Then, add 0.5 mL of 200 filter paper activity (FPU)/mL cellulase.\n\tNOTE: The final ratio of cellulase to bamboo should be 20 FPU per 1 g of bamboo.\nIncubate the mixture at 50 °C for 36 h in a shaker.\n\tNOTE: After hydrolysis, some solid will remain in the mixture.\nObtain a clear hydrolysate by centrifuging at 7,690 x g for 5 min.\nQuantify the glucose, xylose, and other chemicals with a high-pressure liquid chromatograph system equipped with a refractive index detector and a photodiode array detector. Use an HPX-87H column (300 mm x 7.8 mm) and a mobile phase of 5 mM H2SO4 solution at a 0.8 mL/min flow rate12.\nFor a large volume of hydrolysate preparation, mix 2 kg of bamboo powder and 18 L of 0.25 M NaOH in a 30-L stainless-steel tank.",
    "Incubate the tank at 121 °C in an autoclave for 60 min. After incubation, wash the mixture with 40 L of water in a 60 L plastic tank. Repeat this washing 5 times.\nUse water to adjust the total washed bamboo to a volume of 20 L. Adjust the pH of the mixture to 5.0 using 98% H2SO4.\nEnzymatically hydrolyze the mixture in a modified shaking water bath, equipped with a mechanical agitator to ensure that the mixture is well distributed. Add 200 mL of 200 FPU/mL cellulase and incubate the mixture at 50 °C for 36 h.\nAfter hydrolysis, centrifuge the mixture at 4,700 x g for 10 min.\n2. 2,3-Butanediol Production by Wildtype K. pneumoniae\nUse 3 L of bamboo hydrolysate as the solvent for medium preparation.\nPrepare a fermentation medium containing 4 g/L corn steep liquor, 2 g/L (NH4)2SO4, 6 g/L K2HPO4, 3 g/L KH2PO4, and 0.2 g/L MgSO4. Adjust the pH of the medium to neutral using 2.5 M NaOH. Use a 5-L bioreactor containing 3 L of autoclaved fermentation medium for fermentation.\nUse K. pneumoniae cells stored in a -80 °C low-temperature refrigerator.\nFor the seed culture, incubate a 250 mL flask containing 50 mL of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium overnight at 37 °C, with shaking at 200 rpm. Use LB medium containing 10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, and 10 g/L NaCl.\n\tNOTE: The cell density of the seed culture should reach OD 2 (optical density at 600 nm).\nInoculate one flask of 50 mL of the seed culture in the bioreactor. Maintain the culture at pH 6.0 and 37 °C. Use an air supplementation rate of 2 L/min and an agitation rate of 250 rpm, creating a microaerobic condition.",
    "Collect 5 mL samples every 2 h during the fermentation and analyze them with high-pressure liquid chromatography to determine the chemical concentrations in the broth4.\nMonitor the alkali added to the bioreactor online using MFCS/DA.\n\t\tNOTE: Organic acids are produced in the fermentation process, and NaOH is added to keep the culture pH stable. The volume of alkali added represents the amount of acid produced. When the alkali-added line plateaus, the process is finished, either because of carbon source exhaustion or cell death.\n3. R-acetoin Production by the budC Mutant of K. pneumoniae\nPrepare a medium for acetoin production containing 4 g/L corn steep liquor, 2 g/L (NH4)2SO4, 3 g/L sodium acetate, 0.4 g/L KCl, and 0.1 g/L MgSO4.\nUse K. pneumoniae-ΔbudC for R-acetoin production. Repeat steps 2.4-2.5.\n\tNOTE: budC encodes 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase. K. pneumoniae-ΔbudC loses the 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase activity and produces R-acetoin instead of 2,3-butanediol.\nMaintain the culture at pH 6.0 and 37 °C. Use an air supplementation rate of 4 L/min and an agitation rate of 450 rpm, an aerobic condition.\n\tNOTE: The oxygen supplementation is higher than that of 2,3-butanediol production.\nAssay the samples as in step 2.6.\n4. 2-Ketogluconic Acid Production by the budA Mutant of K. pneumoniae\nFor 2-ketogluconic acid production, use the same medium as for R-acetoin production.\nUse K. pneumoniae-ΔbudA for 2-ketogluconic acid production. Repeat steps 2.4-2.5.\n\tNOTE: budA encodes α-acetolactate decarboxylase. K. pneumoniae-ΔbudA loses the α-acetolactate decarboxylase activity and produces 2-ketogluconic acid, using glucose as a substrate.\n\tNOTE: 2-ketogluconic acid synthesis is an acidic condition-dependent process. A two-stage fermentation has been developed for 2-ketogluconic acid production10; in the first stage, the seed culture is inoculated in the bioreactor.\nMaintain the culture at pH 7.0 and 37 °C. Use an air supplementation rate of 4 L/min and an agitation rate of 500 rpm.",
    "NOTE: In these conditions, cells grow very fast (the cell density reaches OD 7 in about 4 h). Then, the fermentation progresses to the second stage, during which the culture pH decreases to 5.0. No acid is added; the organic acids produced in the culture naturally lead to the pH decrease. In these acidic conditions, cell growth stops, but 2-ketogluconic acid is synthesized and accumulates in the broth.\nAssay the samples as in step 2.6. Using the hydrolysate of bamboo as the carbon source.\n\tNOTE: The glucose in the medium is converted to 2-ketogluconic acid, and the xylose is converted to xylonic acid. Thus, a mixture of 2-ketogluconic acid and xylonic acid is obtained.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
