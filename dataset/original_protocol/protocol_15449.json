    "1. Equipment Preparation\nMed fusion pump for propofol infusion\nPlace nasotracheal tubes under heating mattress\nConnect camera to scope and check orientation\nThree movements affect the view through the scope:\n\t\t\nIn and out.\nRotation using a two-handed maneuver.\nFlexion and extension of the tip of the scope.\n2. Additional Equipment\nFentanyl 0.5-1.0 mcg/kg \n12F red rubber suction catheter\nGlycopyrrolate 0.1-0.2 mg \nMetal insufflation hook\nAfrin nasal spray \nLubricant\nLidocaine 2% or 4% for spraying nares\n3. Patient Preparation\nPerform mask induction maintaining spontaneous ventilation.\nStart IV and give fentanyl and glycopyrrolate IV.\nGive propofol bolus 1 mg/kg and begin propofol infusion 200 mcg/kg/min.\nTape eyes before spraying Afrin to avoid dilation of pupils.\nSpray Afrin and lidocaine in both nares.\nMask ventilate the patient to distribute Afrin and lidocaine distally.\nPass red rubber catheter into both nares to check patency.\nChoose the more patent nostril for the fiberoptic scope.\nKeep the red rubber in the other nostril with tip in the hypopharynx for O2.\nUse insufflation hook to connect red rubber to the circuit and administer 2 L/min of O2 (don't insufflate high flows into the hypopharynx).\n4. Actual Fiberoptic Intubation\nTake connector off the nasotracheal tube.\nAdvance tube all the way up the lubricated fiberoptic scope.\nClean fiberoptic tip with alcohol\nPut a slight curve on the end of the scope to follow the floor of the nose.\nThread the fiberoptic to the larynx blindly.\nLook for any recognizable anatomic structures.  FREEZE!\nBring anatomic structures into the center of the field and keep them there.\nWhen approaching the vocal cords, give a bolus of propofol 1 mg/kg IV.\nOnce through the cords, make a downward turn into the trachea.\nFollow tracheal rings to the level of the carina.\nYou may require an additional propofol bolus of 1 mg/kg IV.",
    "Make sure the fiberoptic scope tip is in a neutral position.\nThread the ETT.  If the ETT gets hung up at the larynx, give a 360Â° turn of the tube to spin it into the trachea.\n5. Representative Results\nThis video shows an efficient technique for elective fiberoptic intubation in pediatric patients that is easily teachable to residents and fellows and reproducible. The main key is to maintain spontaneous ventilation at all times. Good equipment preparation before hand is also important.Subscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
