Step-by-step illustration of nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA)\nNote: The size and number of EVPs from different biological samples have been successfully measured using this NTA protocol, including EVPs from cell culture conditioned media, tissue explant conditioned media, and plasma.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] Samples from ① in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] (after 12,000 × g spin) can also be used. EVPs can be aliquoted and stored at ‒80°C prior to use in the NTA assay.\nDilute EVP samples in PBS in a 2 mL Eppendorf tube. A minimum of 1 mL of sample solution should be prepared. See Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for optimal dilution factors.\nSet focus:\nDilute standard 100 nm beads 1:500 in PBS.\nNote: Standard beads are used for focusing and to ensure that the particle size is correct. Use NanoSight Size Transfer Standard beads (Malvern, NTA4088). The starting dilution of standard beads is 1:500, but beads might be further diluted if the concentration is too high for a particular Lot#. Store diluted beads at 4°C for up to one month.\nPlace the loading tubing in the bead suspension.\nClick on LOAD, CAPTURE, START CAMERA, and move the stage to the ideal laser beam position with even distribution of particles.\nFocus on the beads by moving to the ideal imaging plane.\nAdjust the CAMERA LEVEL until the maximum number of EVPs can be seen. The camera level should not be higher than 12 to ensure optimal signal to noise ratio.\nWhen prompted, transfer the loading tube to the waste and remove the tube containing the beads.\nClick on FLUSH.",
    "Run the sample. Each sample should be captured in triplicate for 60 s:\nPlace the sample in the tube holder and introduce the loading tubing into the sample, ensuring it is fully submerged.\nClick on LOAD, CAPTURE, and START CAMERA. Focus on the particles. SCREEN GAIN: 1 ; CAMERA LEVEL should not be higher than 12.\nCritical: The camera level should be kept consistent among samples to be compared.\nGo to SOP tab, create an experiment folder and type in the file name. Select the acquisition script.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3195-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "Critical: To determine the optimal dilution while running your samples, start from the lowest dilution and work towards higher concentrations until the particle number counted by NanoSight is between 2 × 108–2 × 109 particles per mL. We recommend preparing serial dilutions to achieve this.\nNote: Start and shut down the machine by priming it with Milli-Q water, in order to avoid deposition of PBS salt crystals and organic matter from the samples in the tubing and gasket.\nAlternatives: For NS300, use syringes (1 mL) for all steps. The protocol for acquiring samples on the NS300 is same as for NS500. After running your sample, prime three times with PBS then two times with Milli-Q water. Machine settings: Set the script to Number of captures: 3; Capture duration (s): 60 sec; syringe speed should be 100 μL/s for running the samples and 1000 μL/s for washing.\nNote: When using the NS300, syringes should be changed each time a different solution or sample is injected. See problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] in troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section.\nTEM analysis\nTEM is used to characterize EVPs visually and morphologically (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3195-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. The main steps required to perform transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on EVPs\nPreparation of samples for TEM analyses\nTiming: 10 min\nDilute EVP samples (prepared according to Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], step ②) in PBS to a final concentration of 0.1 μg/μL of EVP protein (measured using a commercial BCA assay).\nNote: Freshly isolated samples should be used for best image quality, but samples stored at ‒80°C can also be used.\nPlace the required number of coated grids into the chamber of a plasma cleaner (Pelco easiGlow, Ted Pella Inc, CA).\nRun the cycle to neutralize any static charges on the grids.",
    "Note: The above step renders the grids hydrophilic and ensures even distribution of the sample across the grid.\nPlace 5 μL of sample on a formvar/carbon-coated 400 mesh copper grid.\nAllow to settle for 1 min.\nUsing a wedge of Whatman Grade 1 filter paper:\nDry the sample by touching the edge of the grid and wicking away the solution.\nNegatively stain with 4 successive drops of 1.5% aqueous solution of uranyl acetate (UrAc).\nDry between each drop by wicking the solution away.\nAir-dry grid.\nNote: When imaging freshly isolated EVPs, a 2% PFA (paraformaldehyde) fixation does not affect image quality. For later imaging, a 2% PFA fixation can be an alternative to ‒80°C storage but we have not compared these methods side-by-side.\nCritical: The UrAc is radioactive and must be collected & disposed of accordingly. It is a VERY weak radiation emitter (10’000Bq per gram, https://ehs.weill.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/uranyl_acetate.pdf[href=https://ehs.weill.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/uranyl_acetate.pdf]), so no special precautions other than wearing gloves are needed (no shielding, or other specific personal protective equipment is required).\nAlternatives: An alternative protocol can be used in which after the sample has been allowed to settle for 1 minute, the grid is inverted onto a 100 μL droplet of UrAc (on a sheet of parafilm), allowed to sit for 1 minute and then washed by transferring to 3 successive droplets of deionized water, then inverted and air dried. This protocol makes it easier to collect the UrAc for disposal.\nNote: The grid can be preserved in a grid storage box at room temperature (20°C–22°C) for 1–2 weeks, although it is preferable to image fresh grids by TEM, if feasible.\nTEM analysis\nTiming: 1 h per sample\nCheck TEM alignment according to protocol from JEOL (https://manualzz.com/doc/4151342/jeol-1400-tem-user-guide[href=https://manualzz.com/doc/4151342/jeol-1400-tem-user-guide]).\nMount prepared grid in sample holder.",
    "Insert sample holder into the TEM column and wait for the vacuum to equilibrate.\nInsert camera into TEM column.\nTurn on the filament.\nImage the grids with JEOL JEM 1400 (JEOL, USA, Ltd, Peabody, MA) transmission electron microscope operating at 100 kV. Capture images on a Veleta 2 K × 2 K CCD camera (EMSIS, Munich, Germany).\nCapture 10–15 images from each of 3 randomly selected areas of each grid at 50,000x and 100,000x lens magnification.\nCalibrate the camera magnification using a grid with a grating replica (such as EMS cat# 80050) with line spacing of 463 nm (2160 lines/mm).\nNote: Scale bars on images reflect the magnification at the camera.\nPreparation of EVP samples for LC-MS/MS\nHere we describe a simple method using 8 M urea-based lysis of EVPs from EVP-enriched samples diluted in PBS. The protocol is composed of the steps illustrated in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], use inexpensive chemicals and can be completed in less than 12 h. The advantage of this protocol is that it relies on established proteomics workflows and is done with minimal transfer between vials, thereby minimizing sample loss. Alternatively, sample preparation includes suspension traps (S-trap)4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] or filter-aided sample preparation (FASP),5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] although we have not evaluated these strategies for EVP analysis.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3195-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

    "Note: If sample volume is not decreasing, freeze sample vials in liquid nitrogen and repeat vacuum centrifugation.\nDissolve, denature, and reduce proteins in EVP sample:\nAdd 25 μL denaturing buffer to the dried EVP samples. See problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3] in troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section.\nIncubate at room temperature (20°C–22°C) for 1 h under vigorous shaking by placing in an Eppendorf thermomixer at room temperature (temperature should not exceed 30°C).\nAlkylate reduced disulfide bonds:\nPrepare a 100 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) solution in a tinted reaction tube by dissolving 18.5 mg IAA in 1 mL 50 mM ABC.\nAdd 5 μL IAA solution to each EVP sample.\nIncubate at room temperature (20°–22˚), in the dark, for 1 h with vigorous shaking. A piece of tinfoil may be placed over the shaker to protect from light.\nDigest proteins with Endopeptidase Lys-C:\nLower the urea concentration by adding 30 μL of 50 mM ABC to each sample.\nAdd 180 μL of 50 mM ABC to the Endopeptidase Lys-C stock to obtain a concentration of 0.1 μg/μL.\nAdd 5 μL Lys-C solution to each tube and incubate on a shaker at room temperature (20°C–22°C) overnight.\nDigest proteins with trypsin:\nLower the concentration of urea further by adding 65 μL of 50 mM ABC to each sample.\nDissolve the aliquoted lyophilized trypsin in 200 μL of 50 mM ABC.\nAdd 5 μL of trypsin solution to each sample and incubate on shaker at room temperature (20°C–22°C) for 6 h.\nHalt digestion by adding 1 μL neat trifluoroacetic acid (TFA).\nReverse-phase purification of EVP peptides:\nPlace the pre-labeled micro-purification tips in a compatible table-top centrifuge (such as Sonation STC-V2, as seen in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3195-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

    "Figure 8. A D200 pipette tip with a C18 plug at the bottom, placed in a 2 mL Eppendorf microcentrifuge tube\nAlternatives: If a centrifuge is not compatible with pipette tips, make a hole in the lid of a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube, place the tip in the vial and place the vial in the centrifuge. If the centrifuge does not close, push the tip further into the tube (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\nActivate the material by placing the micro-purification tip in the centrifuge and place 70 μL of Activation solvent in the tip.\nCentrifuge until the Activation solvent has passed through but avoid dehydration of the column material, see problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3] in troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section.\nNote: Keep centrifugation (<3000 × g) time short for this step. 10–15 seconds is usually sufficient.\nIf collecting in a microcentrifuge tube, discard the flow-through. If not, proceed to step d.\nPlace 70 μL of Equilibration/washing solvent in each tube and centrifuge until the liquid has been pushed through.\nNote: Spinning time varies depending on centrifuge model, but 30 seconds is usually sufficient.\nDiscard the flow-through. Repeat step d.\nPlace a small drop (approx. 10 μL) of Equilibration/washing solvent in each tube and spin for 1–2 s. This ensures that the tips do not dry while loading the sample.\nPlace the samples in the correct pre-labeled tips.\nCentrifuge until all liquid has been pushed through.\nKeep centrifugation times similar to the equilibration step.\nDiscard the flow-through.\nWash the tips by placing 70 μL of the Equilibration/washing solvent in each tip.\nContinue to centrifuge until the liquid has been pushed through.\nKeep centrifugation times same as in the equilibration step.\nDiscard the flow-through.",
    "Elute the peptides by connecting the modified combi-tip to the micro-purification tip as seen in Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]A and push 70 μL of Elution solvent through the tip, as in Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]B.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3195-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9.

Doing so may lower the peptide recovery. See problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] in troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section.\nLC-MS/MS analysis of EVP peptides\nTiming: Time depends on gradient length. Typically, 2–3 h per sample.\nIn this step the samples are loaded in the autosampler and analyzed by mass spectrometry.\nDissolve dry peptides:\nAdd 8 μL of 0.1% TFA to each HPLC vial containing dried sample and vortex for 5 s. Ensure the liquid is located at the bottom of your tube.\nPlace HPLC tubes in autosampler. 3 μL of 8 μL are injected per analysis.\nProgram mass spectrometer. Use a 90 min∗ linear gradient increasing from 1% B/99% A to 35% B/65% A (A: 0.1% formic acid, B: 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid).\nNote: ∗ The duration can be modified based on sample complexity and acquisition speed of the mass spectrometer. See problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7] in troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section.\nBioinformatic analysis of proteomics data\nTiming: Time depends on the number of samples to be analyzed and will typically require 1–2 days.\nIn this step tandem MS data is queried and analyzed using proteomic databases and statistical software (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3195-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10.

    "Calculate the relative abundance of a given protein.\nProcess high resolution/high mass accuracy nano-LC-MS/MS data using Proteome Discoverer 1.4.1.14/Mascot 2.5 software.\nUsing this software, calculate the relative abundance of a given protein from the average area of the three most intense peptide signals.\nNote: This abundance measure has a range of approximately 4 orders of magnitude for this software, resulting in a lower signal range of 0.8–1.2 × 106 that can be integrated for proteins of low abundance.\nProteins for which area intensities are below the minimum range or were not detected are assigned an area of zero.\nAlternatives: Other search and quantitation algorithms can also be used for the data analysis,6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] e.g. MaxQuant.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]\nQuery human data against the UniProt’s Complete HUMAN proteome (https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000005640[href=https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000005640]).\nQuery mouse data against UniProt’s Complete MOUSE proteome https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000000589[href=https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000000589]).\nUse the following parameters: Enzyme: Trypsin/P, maximum allowed missed cleavage sites: 2, monoisotopic precursor mass tolerance: 10 ppm, monoisotopic fragment mass tolerance: 0.02 Da, dynamic modifications: Oxidation (M), Acetyl (Protein N-term), static modification: Carbamidomethyl (C).\nUse Percolator to calculate peptide False Discovery Rates (FDR), which are calculated per file. An FDR of 1% is applied to each separate LC-MS/MS file.\nFor EVP-enriched samples that have been in contact with Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, such as samples that originated from cell culture), concatenate a bovine-specific database to the human and mouse databases when querying the data to exclude bovine peptides.\nFor plasma and tissue samples, concatenate solely the sequences of porcine trypsin and Endopeptidase Lys-C to the human and mouse databases and use for exclusion.\nProcess proteomic data for further analysis.\nFor the proteins identified by multiple UniProt IDs, collapse the probe (based on UniProt ID) values at the protein level using the probe with the maximum intensity.",
    "Following Log2 transformation, consider quantile normalization if observed changes across samples are due to unwanted technical variability.\nProcess the proteomic expression data using the ‘Limma’ package of the open-source R program (https://www.r-project.org[href=https://www.r-project.org]).\nImport and normalize proteomic expression data using the ‘normalizeBetweenArrays’ function (method = quantile).\nNote: It is possible to verify the distribution of protein expression values, a total number of unique proteins or unsupervised clustering to determine potential variability among samples. If these plots identify outlier samples or substantial deviations from other samples, or when the researchers analyze pooled samples from multiple experiments run at different times, quantile normalization is warranted.\nVisualize proteomic data.\nUse heatmaps and clustering for data visualization.\nGenerate a heatmap using the GENE-E software (http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/gene-e[href=http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/gene-e]).\nAlternatives: A heatmap can be generated using the open-source R program or other software, such as the Morpheus web-based tool (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/[href=https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/]).\nUse principal component analysis (PCA) and three-dimensional t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) plots for data reduction, simplifying datasets to three dimensions for display purposes.\nConduct PCA using the ‘princomp()’ function with default options using the R program.\nIllustrate PCA results for proteomics data in a three-dimensional plot using the ‘rgl’ package and ‘plot3d()’ function.\nApply the t-SNE algorithm to generate t-SNE plots using the ‘Rtsne’ R package.\nConduct consensus clustering to assess whether proteomic expression differs between sample groups using the GENE-E software.\nNote: Consensus clustering is a resampling-based method for class discovery and one of the unsupervised clustering methods.\nAlternatives: Python, R, or MATLAB language provides useful packages for computational biology. We recommend generating PCA, t-SNA, hierarchical clustering, or other statistical analyses using these program languages.\nPerform biomarker selection and pathway analysis (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3195-Fig11.jpg\nFigure 11.

For example, the cutoff to select specific markers is a fold-change ≥10, FDR <0.05, and mean protein expression ≥108 with positivity in ≥80% of the corresponding sample type (i.e., at least eight out of ten samples).\nApply the Random Forest algorithm to identify biomarkers differentiating sample groups (e.g., tumor versus non-tumor samples).\nNote: Random Forest is a machine learning method that combines the output of an ensemble of regression trees to predict a class variable (e.g., tumor or non-tumor class). This method reduces the risk of over-fitting and makes the method robust to outliers and noise in the input data.\nUse Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) provided by the caret R package for feature selection using default options with ten-fold cross-validation.\nDetermine the minimal number of top proteins with the best accuracy according to the variable importance measure.",
    "Use Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to identify significant biological functions or pathways related to identified proteins.\nNote: GSEA ranks all proteins according to their differential expression levels by signal-to-noise statistic, (μA - μB)/(αA + αB) where μ and α represent the mean and standard deviation of proteomic expression, respectively, for each class. GSEA calculates the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic to evaluate whether proteins from a pre-determined pathway are significantly overrepresented towards the top or bottom of the ranked gene list.\nNote: GSEA statistics include enrichment score, normalized enrichment score, false discovery rate, and nominal P value (http://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/doc/GSEAUserGuideFrame.html[href=http://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/doc/GSEAUserGuideFrame.html]).\nOptional: Given the lack of coherence in the majority of expression datasets and the limited number of gene sets being evaluated, an FDR threshold of 25% is often adequate. If the researcher utilizes gene set permutation rather than phenotypic permutation, the researcher can use a higher FDR threshold, such as 5%.\nUse Gene sets from the Molecular signatures database (MSigDB, http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/[href=http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/]) for GSEA (e.g., H: hallmark gene sets; C2:KEGG: canonical pathways from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes [KEGG] pathway database; C2:Reactome: canonical pathways from the Reactome pathway database; C5: gene sets based on Gene Ontology [GO] term).\nAlternatives: We recommend comparing between different biological pathway analysis tools, such as DAVID (The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery; https://david.ncifcrf.gov/[href=https://david.ncifcrf.gov/]), a free resource or the commercial Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (QIAGEN IPA; https://analysis.ingenuity.com/[href=https://analysis.ingenuity.com/]).\nExoView analysis\nTiming: 24 h\nThis protocol provides step-by-step instructions for performing single EVP analysis using the ExoView R100 platform (Unchained Labs). ExoView allows the detection of specific proteins on/within single EVPs using antibodies specific for these proteins (Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]). The basic kit includes anti-CD63, -CD9, and -CD81 antibodies but other antibodies of interest can be used to capture EVPs and/or detect antigen presence on/in single EVPs.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3195-Fig12.jpg",

    "Note: Depending on the EVP sample concentration, the amount of lysis buffer to be added may vary. In some cases, lysis buffer addition may not be necessary. As shown in the next steps, either 5 μg or 20 μg of EVP sample will be loaded per well. If the EVP sample concentration is sufficiently high, and thus it is possible to add loading buffer without reaching the maximum loading volume, then adding lysis buffer is recommended. Otherwise directly mix the EVP sample with 4X or 2X sample loading buffer. See problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11] in troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section.\nNote: Lysis buffer should be kept cold on ice or at 4°C and should be prepared and used immediately (within minutes).

    "Note: For example, if working with human plasma, the monoclonal mouse anti-human CD9 (clone MM2/57) or monoclonal mouse anti-human syntenin-1 (S-31) can be used at a concentration of 0.1 μg/mL, respectively, as loading controls.\nIncubate overnight (16–18 h) on a rocking platform in the cold room (4°C).\nNote: The antibody can normally be re-used (<5 times), especially if containing sodium azide.\nThe following day, pour off the primary antibody, and wash three times, 10 min each, with washing buffer, on a rocking platform, in the cold room (4°C). Discard the washing buffer.\nAdd 5–10 mL HRP-conjugated secondary antibody diluted 1:10000 in washing buffer to the appropriate concentration and incubate at room temperature (20°C–22°C) or in the cold room (4°C), with rocking, for 1–1.5 h.\nPour off the secondary antibody, and wash three times, 10 min each, with washing buffer on a rocking platform at room temperature (20°C–22°C) or in the cold room (4°C).\nDuring the last wash, prepare the ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) reagent by mixing equal volumes of each component of HRP substrate (ECL reagent A and B).\nNote: The washing buffer can be stored at room temperature (20°C–22°C) for up to a week.\nNote: The total volume of HRP substrate needed depends on the size of the membrane and the number of membranes. The minimum volume is 1 mL A and 1 mL B for one membrane (equivalent for mini gels, i.e., XP04202BOX, Life Technologies).\nPour off the washing buffer and add the ECL mix to the membrane.\nIncubate for 1 min (this step does not have to be in the dark), then remove the ECL mix and transfer the membrane to an autoradiography cassette, or alternatively a ChemiDoc station.",
    "Develop the autoradiography film in the dark room, determining the optimal exposure time empirically (5 s - 5 min) in the dark room.\nIn order to quantify the individual bands corresponding to proteins of interest, the autoradiography films are acquired using a transparency scanner (scanner with light source on both sides of the bed) with high resolution (600 dpi) in TIFF file format.\nSubsequently, using the software ImageJ, each band is framed as single region of interest and quantified.\nAfter removing background values, the final relative quantification values are the ratio of net band to net loading control.\nExoELISA\nTiming: 30–48 h\nThis protocol describes the steps required to perform an “in-house” indirect ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) on EVP proteins (ExoELISA). This method can be used to detect proteins present on the surface or packaged inside EVPs isolated from different sources (including cell culture supernatants, tissue explants, and plasma) when a commercial ELISA kit is not available. Figure 20[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig20] depicts the major steps of the protocol: sample preparation (1); EVP immobilization (2), EVP permeabilization (3) and blocking (4); antigen(s) immunostaining (5–6); signal detection (7); quantification (8).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3195-Fig20.jpg\nFigure 20.

    "For EVP samples with a concentration higher than 50 μg/mL, dilute EVPs in 1x coating buffer to obtain a 10–30 μg/mL suspension.\nFor EVP samples with a concentration lower than 50 μg/mL, including unfractionated plasma and culture supernatant, dilute EVPs at a 1:1 ratio with 2x coating buffer to obtain a 10–30 μg/mL suspension.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3195-Fig21.jpg\nFigure 21. TEM images of EVPs incubated overnight with PBS versus 1x coating buffer\nScale bar: 200 nm.\nNote: ExoELISA coating buffers can be stored at room temperature (20°C–22°C) for up to 12 months.\nNote: The incubation of EVPs with coating buffer does not alter EVP structure, as shown by TEM analysis (Figure 21[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig21]).\nCritical: The EVP concentration required for ExoELISA measurement can vary according to the sample type, concentration of the target protein per vesicle, presence of contaminants, and EVP dispersion in the EVP suspension. The ideal EVP concentration for immobilization needs to be empirically determined by preparing serial dilutions of the EVP suspension and analyzing the final signal to noise ratio.\nPlate coating (EVP capture):\nPipet 50 μL of the EVP suspension (sample) and coating buffer (blank) into the wells of a 96-well plate, ensuring the solution covers the bottom of the well. Each sample should be assayed in triplicate (two wells for protein-specific antibody(ies) [Ab] and at least one well for isotype control(s) [Is. ct]). Use the template in Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] to design the sample arrangements in the microwells.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3195_14.csv\nNote that each EVP sample needs to be run in a minimum of two replicates to allow the incubation with protein-specific antibodies (Ab) and their isotype controls (Is. ct). More than one protein can be assayed in the same SampleAb well.",
    "Note: Always use assay microplates with flat bottom wells. In addition to plate coating with proteins, polystyrene cell-culture treated plates with slight hydrophilic properties can also be employed for the immobilization of EVPs. The choice of the assay microplate color depends on the type of secondary antibody and the nature of the detected signal. Black plates with clear bottom should be used to measure fluorescence signals, white or clear plates should be used to measure colorimetric signals, and white plates should be used to measure chemiluminescent signals.\nIncubate the plate overnight (12–20 h) at 4°C, in the dark without shaking.\nRemove unbound EVPs by washing 3 times in PBS.\nCarefully aspirate all supernatant from each well.\nSlowly pipette 100 μL of sterile PBS per well, using a multichannel pipettor.\nIncubate 5 min at room temperature (20°C–22°C).\nCarefully aspirate the PBS.\nRepeat steps 65c.i-iii two times for a total of 3 washes.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3195-Fig22.jpg\nFigure 22. Epifluorescence image and magnification of fluorescently-labeled EVPs (PKH67, green) immobilized on the surface of a microwell and washed with PBS\nEVPs are passively adsorbed onto microwells via an alkaline bicarbonate coating buffer, allowing the formation of hydrophobic interactions between the EVP proteins and plastic. Scale bar: 50 μm.\nNote: We recommend testing the efficiency of EVP plate coating before performing the entire ExoELISA assay. To do this, label the EVP membrane with a lipophilic dye (PKH26, CellVue etc. according to manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/deepweb/assets/sigmaaldrich/product/documents/271/475/mini26bul.pdf]) prior to immobilization, and acquire fluorescent signals (using a plate reader or microscope) after the first wash. Examples of fluorescently-labeled EVPs bound to the multiwell plate are shown in Figure 22[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig22].",
    "Critical: All aspiration and pipetting steps for this step and following steps should be performed with extreme care, ensuring not to scratch the surface of the well. We suggest equilibrating the pipet tip with reagent before loading and to pipet buffers slowly onto the wall of the well, allowing liquid to flow to the bottom of the well.\nAlternatives: This protocol describes how to measure EVP proteins qualitatively, allowing the comparison of their relative levels (expressed as FI, a.u., or RLU) between two or more experimental groups. For a quantitative ELISA, a set of protein standards should also be prepared and immobilized following steps 64–65. The range of standard concentrations may vary according to the level of protein expression in the EVP sample. A range between 10 and 10000 pg/mL will cover most EVP protein concentrations, but a narrower range can be empirically determined. At least 7 serial dilutions of the protein standard should be prepared. For quantitative ExoELISA where standards are also immobilized, ELISA microplates with stronger hydrophilic properties could be utilized (Corning 96-well Flat Clear Bottom Black Polystyrene TC-treated Microplates, with Lid, Sterile, Corning #3904).\n(Optional) EVP permeabilization, to expose internal proteins:\nAspirate PBS from each well.\nPipet 100 μL of 0.2% Triton-X in TBS into each well.\nIncubate 5 min at room temperature (20°C–22°C).\nWash two times with PBS (2 × 5 min incubation at room temperature (20°C–22°C)).\nNote: The permeabilization step is only necessary if internal EVP proteins are to be detected. Surface proteins can be detected without the permeabilization step.\nBlocking, to avoid non-specific antibody binding:\nAspirate PBS from each well.\nPipet 100 μL of TNB blocking buffer in each well.\nIncubate 1 h at room temperature (20°C–22°C) in the dark.",
    "Note: TNB blocking buffer is stable for several months (<4 months) when stored at ‒20°C. Bring the buffer back to room temperature (20°C–22°C) before use.\nAntigen(s) immunostaining:\nAspirate TNB buffer from each well.\nWithout washing the plate, pipet 30 μL of the primary antibody/isotype control solution into each well. The primary antibody should be diluted 1:50–1:200 in TNB buffer.\nNote: Each EVP sample should be labeled with the primary antibody/ies in duplicate and their isotype control(s) as a single replicate. The isotype control serves as internal control for non-specific background signal.\nIncubate the plate overnight (12–20 h) at 4°C in the dark.\nNote: More than one antigen/antibody can be assayed at the same time providing that the detecting primary antibodies are raised in different hosts and that the detection equipment has 2 channels. Due to the small size of EVPs, we caution against using more than 2 different primary antibodies in the same assay to avoid steric hindrance between antibodies.\nWash 3 times with PBS (3 × 5 min incubation at room temperature (20°C–22°C).\nPipet 30 μL of the secondary antibody solution in each well. The secondary antibody should be diluted 1:200–1:500 in TNB buffer.\nIncubate the plate for 2 h at room temperature (20°C–22°C) in the dark.\nAspirate the secondary antibody solution.\nWash 3 times with PBS (3 × 5 min incubation at room temperature (20°C–22°C)).\nNote: Secondary antibodies coupled with different fluorophores and with different species reactivity can be used to recognize multiple primary antibodies in the same assay.\nSignal detection:\nAspirate the PBS from each well.\nPipet 200 μL of PBS in each well.",
    "Acquire the plate using a plate reader equipped with fluorescence module or a fluorescence imaging system (e.g., Odyssey, Licor). The plate lid should be removed prior to reading. Acquisition parameters should be set as follows: bottom reading; integration time = 1 s; PMT sensitivity = Auto (unless one is comparing different plates); no shaking.\nAlternatives: As alternatives to fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies, other types of secondary antibodies can be used, such as enzyme-linked antibodies (e.g., HRP or AP). In this case, the detection of antibody density can be assessed upon incubation with colorimetric substrates (e.g., TMB for HRP) or chemiluminescent substrates (e.g., luminol for HRP), followed by absorbance (a.u.) or luminescence (RFU) reading, respectively, using a plate reader equipped with absorbance and luminescence modules. For absorbance and luminescence reading, the plate can be gently shaken before acquisition and top reading should be selected.\nQuantification: for each EVP sample replicate, calculate the protein density based on their fluorescence intensity (FI) measurement using the formula:\n                              FIprotein = FIAb – FIIs. ct - FIBlank.\nNote: If FIAb < FIIs. ct, then the protein is not present in the samples and the FIprotein corresponds to 0. A similar calculation applies for signals measured as a.u. or RFU.\nNote: If protein standards are used, the concentration of the assayed protein can be calculated by plotting the mean FI of standards (y, blank subtracted) and the standard concentration (x), generating the standard curve through a multiparametric curve-fitting model (e.g. four-parameter logistic fit), and then extrapolating sample concentration from their FIprotein intensity (calculated as indicated above)."
