    "This protocol has been approved by the Research, Ethics, and Safety Committee of the Hospital Infantil de México \"Federico Gómez\".\n1. Behavioral Pretest\nPerform a standard, pure-tone audiometric test to confirm that all prospective participants possess normal hearing (20-dB Hearing Level (HL) over octave frequencies of -8,000 Hz). Use the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory31 to ensure that all participants are right-handed.\nGeneration of interval sequences.\nProduce pure tones spanning two octaves, G4-G6, using a sound-editing program.\n\t\tNOTE: Here, the free, open-source sound editing software Audacity is described. Other packages may be used for this purpose.\n\t\t\nFor each tone, open a new project in the sound-editing software.\nUnder the \"Generate\" menu, select \"Tone.\" In the window that appears, select a sine waveform, an amplitude of 0.8, and a duration of 1 s. Enter the value of the frequency that corresponds to the desired note (e.g., 440 Hz for A4). Click on the \"OK\" button.\nUnder the \"File\" menu, select \"Export Audio.\" In the window that opens, enter the desired name for the audio file and choose WAV as the desired file type. Click \"Save.\"\nSelect two consonant and two dissonant intervals, according to Table 1, in such a way that each consonant interval is close to a dissonant interval.\n\t\tNOTE: As an example, consider the consonant intervals of a perfect fifth and an octave and the dissonant intervals of an augmented fourth (tritone) and a major seventh. These are the intervals chosen for the study conducted by the authors.\nGenerate all possible combinations of notes corresponding to these four intervals in the range between G4 and G6.\n\t\t\nFor each interval, open a new project in the sound-editing software and use \"Import Audio\" under the \"File\" menu to import the two WAV files to be concatenated.",
    "Place the cursor at any point over the second tone and click to select. Click on \"Select All\" under the \"Edit\" menu. Under the same menu, click on \"Copy.\"\nPlace the cursor at any point over the first tone and click. Under the \"Edit\" menu click on \"Move Cursor to Track End\" and then click \"Paste\" under the same menu. Export the audio as described in step 1.2.1.3.\nUse a random sequence generator to produce sequences consisting of 100 intervals generated pseudorandomly in such a way that each of the four different intervals occurs exactly 25 times30. To do this, use the random permutation function in the statistical analysis software (see the Table of Materials). Input the four intervals as arguments and create a loop that repeats this process 25 times.\nUse behavioral research software to generate two distinct runs. Load a sequence of 100 intervals in WAV format for each run and associate the identification of each interval with a single trial30.\n\t\tNOTE: Here, E-Prime behavioral research software is used. Other equivalent behavioral research software can be used.\nExplain to participants that they will listen to two sequences of 100 intervals each, where each sequence is associated with a different task and with its own set of instructions. Tell participants that, in both runs, the next interval will be played only when a valid key is pressed.\n\tNOTE: Once the interval recognition sequence commences, it should not be interrupted so that the course of action should be as clear as possible to all participants.\n\t\nHave the participants sit down in front of a laptop computer and wear the provided headphones. Use good-quality over-the-ear headphones. Adjust the sound level to a comfortable level for each subject.",
    "If using the behavioral research software described here, open the tasks created in step 1.2.5 with E-Run. In the window that appears, enter the session and subject number and click \"OK.\" Use the session number to distinguish between runs for each participant.\n\t\tNOTE: The instructions for the task at hand will appear on screen, followed by the beginning of the task itself.\n\t\t\nFirst, in a 2-alternative forced-choice task, simply have the participants identify whether the intervals they hear are consonant or dissonant. Have the participant press \"C\" on the computer keyboard for consonant and \"D\" for dissonant.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Since all participants are expected to have musical training at a conservatory level, they are all expected to be able to distinguish between patently consonant and patently dissonant intervals. The first task serves, in a sense, as confirmation that this is indeed the case.\nSecond, in a 4-alternative forced-choice task, have the participants identify the intervals themselves. Have the participants press the numerals \"4,\" \"5,\" \"7,\" and \"8\" on the computer keyboard to identify the intervals of an augmented fourth, perfect fifth, major seventh, and octave, respectively.\nAt the end of each task, press \"OK\" to automatically save the results for each participant in an individual E-DataAid 2.0 file labeled with the subject and session numbers and with the extension .edat2.\nUse statistical analysis software (e.g., Matlab, SPSS Statistics, or an open-source alternative) to calculate the success rates for each task (i.e. the percentage of successful answers when identifying whether the intervals were consonant or dissonant, and also when identifying the intervals themselves), both individually and as a group32.\n2. fMRI Experiment\nPreparation for the fMRI session.\nGenerate sequences of the same intervals as in step 1.2.3, again composed of two consecutive pure tones with a duration of 1 s each.",
    "NOTE: The vocal range of the participants must now be taken into account, and all notes must fall comfortably within the singing range of each participant.\n\t\t\nUse a random sequence generator to create a randomized sequence of 30 intervals for the listen-only trials30. For the singing trials, create a pseudorandomized sequence of 120 intervals for the participants to listen to a specific interval and then match this target interval with their singing voices. For the pseudorandomized sequence, use the same method as described in step 1.2.4, with the 4 intervals as arguments once again, but now repeating this process 30 times.\nFollowing the same procedure as in step 1.2.5, use behavioral research software to generate three distinct runs, each consisting initially of 10 silent baseline trials, followed by 10 consecutive listen-only trials, and finally by 40 consecutive singing trials.\n\t\t\tNOTE: During the baseline trials, the four intervals appear in random order, while during the singing trials, the four intervals appear in pseudorandomized order, in such a manner that each interval is eventually presented exactly 10 times. The duration of each trial is 10 s, so one whole run lasts 10 min. Since each subject goes through 3 experimental runs, the total duration of the experiment is 30 min. However, allowing for the participants to enter and exit the scanner, for time to set up and test the microphone, for time to obtain the anatomical scan, and for time between functional runs, approximately 1 h of scanner time should be allotted to each participant.",
    "Explain to the participants the sequences of trials to be presented, as described in step 2.1.1.2, and respond to any doubts they might have. Instruct the participants to hum the notes without opening their mouths during the singing trials, keeping the lips still while producing an \"m\" sound.\nConnect a non-magnetic, MR-compatible headset to a laptop. Adjust the sound level to a comfortable level for each subject.\nConnect a small condenser microphone to an audio interface that is in turn connected to the laptop using a shielded twisted-triplet cable.\n\t\tNOTE: The microphone power supply, the audio interface, and the laptop should all be located outside the room housing the scanner.\nCheck the microphone frequency response.\n\t\tNOTE: The purpose of this test is to confirm that the microphone behaves as expected inside the scanner.\n\t\t\nStart a new project in the sound-editing software and select the condenser microphone as the input device.\nGenerate a 440 Hz test tone with a duration of 10 s, as described in section 1.2.1, with the appropriate values for frequency and duration.\nUsing the default sound reproduction software on the laptop, press \"Play\" to send the test tone through the headphones at locations inside (on top of the headrest) and outside (in the control room) the scanner, with the microphone placed between the sides of the headset in each case.\nPress \"Record\" in the sound-editing software to record approximately 1 s of the test tone at each location.\nSelect \"Plot Spectrum\" from the \"Analyze\" menu for each case and compare the response of the microphone to the test tone, both inside and outside the scanner, by checking that the fundamental frequency of the signal received at each location is 440 Hz.\nTape the condenser microphone to the participant's neck, just below the larynx.",
    "Have the participant wear the headset. Place the participant in a magnetic resonance (MR) scanner.\nfMRI session.\nAt the beginning of the session, open the magnetic resonance user interface (MRUI) software package. Use the MRUI to program the acquisition paradigm.\n\t\tNOTE: Some variation in the interface is to be expected between different models.\n\t\t\nSelect the \"Patient\" option from the onscreen menu. Enter the participant's name, age, and weight.\nClick on the \"Exam\" button. First, choose \"Head\" and then \"Brain\" from the available options.\nSelect \"3D\" and then \"T1 isometric,\" with the following values for the relevant parameters: Repetition Time (TR) = 10.2 ms, Echo Time (TE) = 4.2 ms, Flip Angle = 90°, and Voxel Size = 1 x 1 x 1 mm3.\n\t\t\tNOTE: For each participant, a T1-weighted anatomical volume will be acquired using a gradient echo pulse sequence for anatomical reference.\nClick on \"Program\" and select EchoPlanaImage_diff_perf_bold (T2*), with the values of the relevant parameters as follows: TE = 40 ms, TR = 10 s, Acquisition Time (TA) = 3 s, Delay in TR = 7 s, Flip Angle = 90°, Field of View (FOV) = 256 mm2, and Matrix Dimensions = 64 x 64. Use the \"Dummy\" option to acquire 5 volumes while entering a value of \"55\" for the total number of volumes.\n\t\t\tNOTE: These values permit the acquisition of functional T2*-weighted whole-head scans according to the sparse sampling paradigm illustrated in Figure 1, where an echo-planar imaging (EPI) \"dummy\" scan is acquired and discarded to allow for T1 saturation effects. Note that in some MRUIs, the value of TR should be 3 s, as it is taken to be the total time during which the acquisition takes place.",
    "Click \"Copy\" to make a copy of this sequence. Place the cursor at the bottom of the list of sequences and then click \"Paste\" twice to set up three consecutive sparse sampling sequences.\nClick \"Start\" to begin the T1-weighted anatomical volume acquisition.\nPresent three runs to the participant, with the runs as described in step 2.1.1.2. Synchronize the start of the runs with the acquisition by the scanner using the scanner trigger-box.\n\t\t\t\nFollow the same procedure as described in section 1.3.2 to begin each one of the three runs, differentiating between runs using the session number. Save the results of three complete runs using the same procedure described in step 1.3.3.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: The timing of the trial presentations is systematically jittered by ±500 ms.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55419/55419fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Sparse-sampling Design.

Data Analysis\nPreprocess the functional data using software designed for the analysis of brain imaging data sequences following standard procedures33.\n\tNOTE: All of the data processing is done using the same software.\n\t\nUse the provided menu option to realign the images to the first volume, resampled and spatially normalized (final voxel size: 2 x 2 x 2 mm3) to standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) stereotactic space34.\nUse the provided menu option to smooth the image using an isotropic, 8 mm, Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel.\nTo model the BOLD response, select a single-bin Finite Impulse Response (FIR) as a basis function (order 1) or boxcar function, spanning the time of volume acquisition (3 s)28.",
    "NOTE: Sparse-sampling protocols, such as this one, do not generally require the FIR to be convolved with the hemodynamic response function, as is commonly the case for event-related fMRI.\nApply a high-pass filter to the BOLD response for each event (1,000 s for the \"singing network\" and 360 s elsewhere).\n\t\tNOTE: Modelling all singing tasks together will amount to a block of 400 s35.\nSubscription Required.
