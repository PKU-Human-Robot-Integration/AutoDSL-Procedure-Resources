    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIsolation of pupae\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThe steps below describe how to isolate a large amount of Drosophila at 2–3 h after puparium formation (APF) by differential buoyancy on sucrose solution to conduct biochemistry experiments.\nUse a wet paint brush (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) to gently move all pupae on the side of bottles (10 bottles or more for each genotype) to a 50 mL beaker with 1× PBS (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3118-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Tools used\n(A) Brush to remove pupae.\n(B and B′) Embryo collection cage and beaker.\n(C) Pipette with the tip cut to be larger than pupae (15 mL).\n(D) Petri dish with holes for liquid absorbance.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3118-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Photos of each key step in the isolation of pupae at different developmental stages\nNote: Use a moist brush to wet all pupae with water and wait for 2–3 min. This step helps to detach the pupae from the bottle walls without damage.\nGently stir the floating pupae with a brush.\nNote: This step helps dissociation of attached pupae.\nUse a plastic spoon to remove and discard all floating pupae (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nNote: Keep the pupae that sink to the bottom of the beaker with PBS for the next step of isolation.\nTransfer the PBS with the remaining pupae into an inverted embryo collection cage in a beaker of similar size (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 3B′; Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nRemove the collection cage and discard the PBS solution (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nGently shake the cage in a beaker with Milli-Q water 2–3 times to wash the pupae (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nRemove the collection cage and discard the water (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F).",
    "Add 11% sucrose solution to the collection cage in a beaker, stir the solution and wait 2–3 min for separation of pupae based on buoyancy (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]G and 4G′).\nNote: Stirring the sucrose solution can also help to move the pupae to the center.\nUse a pipette with the tip cut to be larger than the pupae (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C) to collect all pupae from the bottom of the sucrose solution, and move them to a 10 cm Petri dish with holes (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nNote: For the purpose of this protocol approximately 80 pupae are required for each genotype.\nNote: Place the Petri dish in a container lined with napkins or tissue paper to soak up the excess sucrose solution.\nUse a brush to move all pupae to a 5 cm Petri dish, and place the dish on ice (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]I and 4I′).\nNote: Fly development is significantly delayed on ice, and pupae can be kept on ice 40–60 min.\nTissue dissection and lysate preparation\nTiming: 3–4 h\nThe steps below describe tissue dissection and lysate preparation that are needed for immunoprecipitation in the following steps.\nUse two forceps and a pair of scissors to dissect fly intestines and place them in a tube with chilled 1× PBS.\nNote: Dissect in batches of 20 pupae to minimize proteolysis of the samples. Intestines from approximately 80 pupae will be required for each genotype/sample.\nRemove the PBS solution and add 40 μL Co-IP buffer (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]) supplemented with Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor (1:100). Homogenize the intestines using a Micro-Grinder and a pestle. Place the sample on ice and repeat for the next batches.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3118_3.csv\nStorage: freshly made, 4°C.",
    "Combine the homogenates from all of the batches to create a single sample, add Co-IP buffer to 500 μL and lyse for 1 h at 4°C with rotation (troubleshooting problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).\nRemove 15 μl of lysate from each genotype and mix the lysate with 15 μl 2×SDS sample buffer (Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]) which will be used as the input positive control. Centrifuge the remainder of the samples at 20,412 g for 10 min at 4°C. Move the supernatant to a new tube.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3118_4.csv\nStorage: 1 month, 22°C.\nMeasure protein concentration of each sample and the associated inputs using bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0011430_Pierce_BCA_Protein_Asy_UG.pdf].\nNote: Intestines from 80 pupae will yield approximately 1 mg of protein (2 mg/mL).\nInput positive control:\nRemove 20 μg of protein from each input sample.\nAdd 2×SDS sample buffer to a final volume of 30 μL.\nAdd 10 μL of 4× NuPAGE LDS sample buffer supplemented with β-mercaptoethanol (10%) and mix.\nNote: These samples can be stored at −80°C\nImmunoprecipitation of proteins from staged isolated tissues\nTiming: approximately 12–15 h\nThe steps below describe immunoprecipitation of proteins from staged isolated intestine lysates.\nBriefly wash 15 μL V5 trap agarose bead slurry with 1× PBS and centrifuge for 2 min at 1500 g to pellet beads. Remove the supernatant and repeat the wash 2 more times.\nNote: This step can be conducted simultaneously with step 16.\nMix equal amounts of protein (800–1000 μg) from each sample with Co-IP buffer to a final volume of 1 mL and incubate the samples with V5 Trap agarose beads for 12–14 h with rotation at 4°C.",
    "Note: 70–80 intestines will typically yield >800 μg protein. The number of intestines used for immunoprecipitation depends on both bait protein expression levels in the tissue and the antibody used for immunoprecipitation. The amount can be optimized accordingly for each experiment.\nSpin the beads at 1500 g for 2 min at 4°C.\nCritical: The centrifuge speed must be below 2000 g to avoid breaking of the beads.\nRemove the supernatant and add 1 mL chilled Co-IP buffer. Wash for 20 min with rotation at 4°C.\nRepeat steps 19–20 5 times.\nRemove the supernatant and add 50 μL 1× NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer supplemented with β-mercaptoethanol (10%) to the beads. Boil the beads and the input samples (Step 16) for 10 min at 100°C.\nSpin down the beads at 1500 g for 5 min at 22°C and move the supernatant from the beads to a new tube.\nPrepare to load samples onto the SDS-PAGE gels for electrophoresis (troubleshooting problems 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]).\nWestern blot\nTiming: 1–2 days\nThe steps below describe analysis of immunoprecipitation samples by western blot. Western blot was conducted according to standard protocol.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6],7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]\nPrepare a Novex Mini Protein Gel (12-well) for protein separation by electrophoresis. Add 1× SDS running buffer into the assembled gel tank.\nLoad 20 μg of each input sample and IP lysates into the wells of a gel.\nRun at 80 V until all lysates are stacked in the gel and then change the voltage to 140 V. Run the samples until the phenol red line reaches the bottom of the gel.\nTransfer the proteins to PVDF membrane in prechilled 1× transfer buffer for 90 min at 290 mA.\nBlock the membrane with 5% non-fat milk in 0.1% PBST for 1 h at 22°C.",
    "Wash the membrane briefly and incubate with antibody against ubiquitin (1:1000) in EveryBlot blocking buffer 12–14 h at 4°C with shaking.\nRemove the primary antibody and wash the membrane with 0.1% PBST for 15 min with shaking at 22°C.\nRepeat step 31 twice.\nIncubate the membrane with mouse HRP secondary antibody in 5% non-fat milk in 0.1% PBST for 1 h at 22°C with shaking.\nWash the membrane with 0.1% PBST for 15 min at 22°C.\nRepeat step 34 twice.\nDevelop the membrane with SuperSignal West Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate or SuperSignal West Atto Ultimate Sensitivity Substrate and image using ChemiDoc MP imaging system.\nBriefly wash the membrane with 0.1% PBST and strip the membrane with Restore PLUS Western Blot Stripping Buffer for 20 min at 22°C with shaking.\nWash the membrane with 0.1% PBST for 15 min at 22°C with shaking.\nRepeat step 38 twice and block the membrane with 5% non-fat milk in 0.1% PBST for 1 h at 22°C.\nIncubate the membrane with antibody against V5 in EveryBlot blocking buffer (1:1,000) 12–14 h at 4°C with shaking.\nRepeat steps 31–36.\nRepeat steps 37–41 with antibody against Actin (1:1000) (troubleshooting problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9])."
