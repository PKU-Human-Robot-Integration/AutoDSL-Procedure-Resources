    "1. Bacterial cell cultures and preparation of Lactobacillus  cell-free supernatant (LCFS)\nNOTE: Steps 1.2 – 1.9 are conducted in an anaerobic chamber.\nPrepare an MRS agar plate and broth containing L-cysteine and sterilize by autoclaving.\nPre-incubate the MRS agar plate in H2 anaerobic chamber maintained at 37 ˚C with 20 ppm oxygen.\nThaw Lactobacillus bacterial stock and inoculate the agar plate with the bacterial culture (Figure 1A (i)).\nIncubate bacteria for 2 - 3 days in H2 anaerobic chamber at 37 ˚C and 20 ppm oxygen until single bacterial colonies are obtained.\nWash and dry the Hungate type anerobic culture tube. Autoclave the culture tube at 121 ˚C for 15 min.\nThen incubate the tube in H2 anaerobic chamber at 37 ˚C and 20 ppm oxygen to remove oxygen.\nPlace 2 - 3 mL of MRS broth into the tube. Seal the tube with a butyl rubber stopper and screw the cap.\nObtain a single colony with a loop and place it into the 1.5 mL culture tube with 500 µL of 1x PBS. (Figure 1A (ii)).\nSuspend the colony using a 1 mL syringe (Figure 1A (iii)). Do this by, inserting the needle of the 1 mL syringe in the center of the tube lid, aspirating the suspended colony and then resuspending it back into the MRS broth media. (Figure 1A (iv)).\nIncubate the MRS broth media in a shaker incubator for 2 days (37 °C, 5% CO2, 200 rpm).\nMeasure the optical density (OD) using a spectrophotometer to monitor bacterial growth curves until the absorbance at OD620 reaches to 2.0.",
    "Separate the bacterial pellets and the conditioned media by centrifuging at 1,000 x g for 15 min. Wash the collected bacterial pellets with 1x PBS and resuspend in 4 mL of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Do not include any antibiotics in the medium.\nMaintain the bacterial pellets in RPMI and incubate in a shaker incubator for 4 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2 at a speed of 100 rpm.\nFor the preparation of the probiotic supernatant, remove the bacterial pellet via centrifugation at 1000 x g, for 15 min at 4 °C.

(Figure 1B (i))\nSpheroid formation\nIn a 15 mL conical tube, dilute the cells from 2.1.5 to obtain 1 - 2 x 105 cells/mL (Figure 1B (ii))",
    "Add final concentration of 0.6% methylcellulose to the cell suspension and transfer the diluted cells to a sterile reservoir.\n\t\tNOTE: For each cell line, the amount of methylcellulose needed should be titrated and determined accordingly.\nUse a multichannel pipette to dispense 200 µL of cells to each well of an ultra-low attachment 96-well round bottom microplate. (Figure 1B (iii))\nIncubate the plate at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 24 - 36 h.\nAfter 24 - 36 h, observe the plate under a light microscope to ensure spheroid formation.\n3. Treating 3D colorectal cancer cells with LCFS\nGenerate spheroids as described in steps 2 and 3.\nBefore performing the LCFS treatment, thaw the frozen LCFS at room temperature (RT) for 10 - 20 min.\nInoculate the LCFS stock solution into a growth medium. Serially dilute to 25%, 12.5%, and 6% in the growth medium (i.e., 25% LCFS = 150 µL of growth medium + 50 µL of LCFS).\nTake out the cell culture plate containing spheroids from the incubator and remove as much of the growth medium as possible from each well using a 200 μL pipette.\nAdd the growth media with LCFS on the cells and incubate at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 24 - 48 h.\n\tNOTE: The volume to be used will depend on the plate size as follows: 2 mL for 6-well cell culture plates; 200 μL for 96-well cell culture plates.\n4. Cell viability for spheroids\nPrepare 8 - 10 LCFS-treated colorectal cancer spheroids in opaque-walled multi-well plates (cell viability assays are performed 48 h after LCFS treatment).\nThaw the cell viability reagent (see Table of Materials) at 4 °C for overnight.\nEquilibrate the cell viability reagent to room temperature before use.",
