    "As described by Sanjuan et al. (2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.104#cpcb104-bib-0014]), EM was used to detect one of the first discernible differences between canonical autophagy and LAP. Whereas the autophagosome comprises a well-described double membrane, the LAPosome is a single-membraned structure that contains engulfed cargo. However, detection of engulfed cargo within a single-membraned phagosome is only enough to distinguish LAP from autophagy, as EM, in the absence of immunogold staining (discussed in Melo, Morgan, Monahan-Earley, Dvorak, & Weller, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.104#cpcb104-bib-0011]), will not allow one to detect the presence of phagosome-associated LC3-II.

    "Immunofluorescence imaging of LC3 localization with cargo-containing phagosomes has proven to be a reliable and robust technique to detect LAP. Localization of LC3 can occur as early as 15 min post-phagocytosis, and fusion of the LAPosome with the lysosome, which degrades LC3-II, can occur as early as 45 min post-phagocytosis. It is important to establish stimulus- and cell-type-specific timing of LAP early in a project's timeline.

This technique allows for a quantitative analysis of LAP by measuring the mean fluorescent intensity of LC3-GFP during LAP.

Plate cell line or primary cells in ∼25 ml cell culture medium at the desired concentration in 100-cm dishes or other appropriately sized vessels and incubate for 4 hr to overnight at 37°C and 5% CO2 to allow cells to adhere.",
    "2. Add uncoated latex beads (control) or LAP beads (IgG-coated beads or Pam3csk4-coated beads) at desired bead-to-cell ratio (recommended: 10:1). Incubate at 37°C and 5% CO2.\n3. At the desired time-point(s), aspirate medium and wash three times with 10 ml cold PBS on ice to remove unphagocytosed beads.\n4. Aspirate final wash and add 10 ml cold PBS to each dish.\n5. With each dish still on ice, use a cell lifter to remove cells. Collect cells in PBS in a conical tube.\n6. Pellet cells with centrifugation for 10 min at 500 × g, 4°C.\n7. Aspirate PBS and wash cell pellet in 10 ml cold homogenization buffer with centrifugation for 10 min at 500 × g, 4°C.\n8. Remove supernatant and resuspend pellet in 1 ml cold homogenization buffer.\n9. With each tube on ice, homogenize cells by drawing up and expelling the cell suspension multiple times using a 1-ml syringe with a 27-G needle.\nCheck for cell disruption using a light microscope (>90% of cells should be disrupted yet have an intact nucleus).\n10. Isolate bead-containing phagosomes (BCPs) via flotation on a sucrose step gradient as follows, with all procedures on ice:\n         \nAdd an equal volume of 62% sucrose solution (∼1.45 ml with cell pellet volume) to cells in homogenization buffer (∼1.45 ml, including cell pellet volume), to a final concentration of 40% sucrose.\nThe final volume of the solution (cells in 40% sucrose) should be ∼2.9 ml.\nPipet 1.45 ml of 62% sucrose solution into an ultra-centrifuge tube.\nCarefully and slowly pipet cells in 40% sucrose on top of the 62% sucrose layer.\nCarefully and slowly pipet 2.9 ml of 35% sucrose solution on top of layer of cells in 40% sucrose.",
    "Carefully and slowly pipet 2.9 ml of 25% sucrose solution on top of 35% sucrose layer.\nCarefully and slowly pipet 2.9 ml of 10% sucrose solution on top of 25% sucrose layer.\nThe volumes listed above are appropriate for a 13.2-ml ultra-centrifuge tube. Other sizes of ultra-centrifuge tubes require different volumes, and the protocol should be adjusted accordingly.\n11. Centrifuge sucrose gradients in a refrigerated ultra-centrifuge with a swinging-bucket rotor for 1 hr at 100,000 × g, 4°C.\n12. Carefully collect BCP band using a 1000-μl pipet tip and transfer to a new ultra-centrifuge tube.\nThe BCP band will be visible at the interface of the 10% and 25% sucrose solutions.\n13. Wash BCP with cold PBS and centrifugation in the refrigerated ultra-centrifuge with a fixed-angle rotor for 15 min at 40,000 × g, 4°C.\n14. Remove supernatant and resuspend pellet in ∼50 μl RIPA buffer for western blot analysis (see Current Protocols article; Ni et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.104#cpcb104-bib-0012]).\nThe BCP pellet may be very small, so be careful not to disturb it when removing the supernatant.\nIf other proteomics procedures are performed with the purified BCP fraction, resuspend the pellet in the appropriate solution and proceed.\nAlthough purification is based on the density of the latex beads, users should ensure that the protein fraction that they are analyzing is phagosomal by using markers such as UNC93B in addition to LAP-specific proteins, such as RUBCN (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.104#cpcb104-fig-0006]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0bf830d3-de6d-4a26-80ac-fdefecfe4d79/cpcb104-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\nPhagosome purification to assess protein association with LAPosomes.
