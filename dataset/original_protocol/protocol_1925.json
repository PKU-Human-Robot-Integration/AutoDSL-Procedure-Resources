Illustration describing the harvest of calvaria containing meninges from euthanized mice\nTop left panel indicates the cut sequence. Panels A–E illustrate each step of the harvest of the calvaria. See also Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2].\nFollowing euthanasia, immediately transcardially perfuse mice with 10 mL sterile pharmaceutical grade saline containing heparin (100 U/mL) followed by 6 mL 10% neutral buffered formalin.\nUsing fine scissors, cut away fur and skin covering the skull. While holding mouse down firmly with a pair of forceps grasping around the neck, make a transverse cut between the eye sockets using fine scissors (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nUsing spring scissors, carefully cut posteriorly along the sides of the skull, starting at the transverse cut made in 1b (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nFinally, use a pair of forceps to lift off the calvaria with meninges attached (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C and 1D). Fix calvaria with associated meninges in 10% neutral buffered formalin O/N at RT in a 15 mL conical tube.\nNote: When removing skull caps, pay close attention to make sure the meninges are extracted along with the skull cap. Sometimes the meninges will come loose, remaining associated with the brain. If this happens, use spring scissors to carefully separate the meninges from the brain while removing the skull cap (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nNote: Complete perfusion is vital for an optimal RNA FISH result, as red blood cells are highly autofluorescent. Perfusion is effective when muscle twitches and blanching of the liver are observed. For more information, see troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].",
    "Note: While this protocol uses 10% formalin for fixation, we have used 4% paraformaldehyde with similar results. If performing immunohistochemistry, fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde is preferred as formalin fixation can reduce immunoreactivity of target proteins with antibodies. If the fixation time, typically 18–20 h, is changed adjustments may have to be made to protease digestion duration to facilitate proper penetration of target probes into the tissue. Lowering the fixation temperature, e.g., by fixation at 4°C, may also increase target binding of some antibodies, by better preservation of antibody epitopes.\nThe next day, extract the fixed meninges from the calvaria (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]):\nPrepare a 24 well plate with two wells containing 1 mL of PBS for each meninges.\nBriefly rinse a calvaria in PBS and place it under a stereomicroscope (optional but recommended). Make sure meninges do not dry out by adding approximately 100 μL PBS.\nExtract the meningeal layers from the skull cap using fine forceps (Louveau et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9], 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) by carefully loosening the meninges around the perimeter. Then, starting at the olfactory bulb area, gently start peeling off meninges. If areas of the meninges stay attached, carefully loosen them with the forceps before continue pulling. Peel meninges towards the midline of the calvaria. Once meninges are gathered in the middle, pull meninges loose, starting at the cerebellum and ending at the olfactory bulbs.\nPlace extracted meninges in the first well with PBS. Wash meninges for 5 min on a shaker (70 rpm).\nUsing forceps, gently transfer meninges to the second well containing PBS and wash for another 5 min on a shaker (70 rpm). Meninges can be left in PBS for some time (e.g., if mounting several meninges sequentially), but should not be stored in the PBS for prolonged periods of time (maximum 1 h at RT).",
    "Note: To facilitate testing of new probes or antibodies, split the calvaria down the midline using a razor blade before extracting the meninges. This generates two samples from each calvaria.\nMount extracted meninges onto microscope slides (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]):\nPlace approximately 100 μL PBS in the middle of a microscope slide. Add the washed meninges to the droplet.\nUsing fine forceps, gently spread meninges out. Carefully remove some of the liquid using a pipette and spread meninges out further. When meninges are sufficiently spread out, remove as much as possible of the remaining liquid using a paper tissue.\nDry meninges on a flat surface O/N at RT.\nCritical: Proper drying of meninges is crucial for subsequent steps (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Improperly dried meninges will detach from slides during target retrieval. Drying time depends on the type of microscope slide. The drying times listed above were optimized using Matsunami TOMO adhesion microscope slides. For more information, see troubleshooting problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nThe next day, wash dried meninges by dipping them about 10 times in distilled water. Dry meninges for 24 h at 42°C or for at least 3 days at RT.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1521-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Images of meningeal whole mounts dried onto microscope slides\nExamples of meningeal whole mount properly dried onto a microscope slide (A) and of improperly dried whole mounts after target retrieval (B and C). Due to insufficient drying, meninges detach during the target retrieval process. Scale bar indicates approximate size of a whole mount, 13 mm. See also Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3].\nPause point: Once meninges have been dried, they can be stored at RT in a dry place. We have successfully used samples that were stored for up to 1 year.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Extraction of meninges from calvaria, related to step 2",
    "Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2. Mounting of extracted meninges onto microscope slides, related to step 3\nRun the RNA FISH assay on dried meningeal whole mounts\nTiming: 7–9 h depending on the number of probes\nDried meninges are subjected to the RNA FISH procedure to visualize targeted mRNA.\nThis protocol follows the manufacturer’s protocol, with a few modifications, and can be found using the following link (document #323100-USM).\nhttps://acdbio.com/sites/default/files/USM-323100%20Multiplex%20Fluorescent%20v2%20User%20Manual_10282019_0.pdf[href=https://acdbio.com/sites/default/files/USM-323100%20Multiplex%20Fluorescent%20v2%20User%20Manual_10282019_0.pdf]\nSet up equipment for target retrieval: Add 1 L distilled water to the water chamber of a Hamilton Beach vegetable steamer and put one container with 200 mL distilled water and one container with 200 mL 1× target retrieval solution in the steaming compartment. Start the preset steaming program, setting the duration for at least 1 h. Use a thermometer to monitor the temperature of the target retrieval solution.\nNote: It may be difficult to reach the target temperature of 100°C for the target retrieval solution. In our laboratory, located at an altitude of approx. 3,500 feet, the maximum temperature was 94°C.\nLay slide with dried meninges flat on the bench. When the target retrieval solution in the steamer reaches 90°C, add 4–5 drops of hydrogen peroxide to meninges and incubate for 10 min at RT. Briefly wash meninges by placing slides in a Tissue Tek slide holder and dipping them in a Tissue Tek staining dish filled with distilled water. Repeat wash. Keep slides in the Tissue Tek slide holder. By now the target retrieval solution should have reached the target temperature.",
    "Carefully open the steamer and submerge slides in the water for 15 s. Transfer slides to the target retrieval solution and incubate for 10–15 min. Carefully remove slides from the steamer and rinse them in a Tissue Tek staining dish filled with distilled water for 15 s and then incubate them in a Tissue Tek staining dish filled with 100% ethanol for 3 min at RT.\nOptional: If a steamer is not available, target retrieval can be performed by boiling samples in the target retrieval solution. Heat 700 mL 1× target retrieval solution in a 1 L beaker on a hot plate until a mild boil is reached. Slowly submerge a slide rack with slides into the solution and boil for 10–15 min. Remove slides, rinse them briefly in distilled water and then incubate them in 100% ethanol for 3 min. Proceed to step 8. Do note that this alternative uses more reagents and that bubbles formed during the boiling increases the risk of meninges detaching from slides.\nNote: For RNA FISH alone, 10 min of target retrieval is sufficient. However, increasing the duration of this step may improve antibody staining. In our experience, a target retrieval of 15 min yielded improved antibody staining, with no apparent loss of RNA FISH staining, although this may be antibody dependent.",
    "Note: If aiming to perform immunohistochemistry following the RNA FISH protocol, do not let slides dry out after incubation in 100% ethanol. Instead, following ethanol incubation, rinse slides in distilled water. Carefully wipe around the meninges with a piece of paper tissue, making sure not to touch the tissue, and draw the hydrophobic barrier. Then add a small amount of distilled water, without contacting the barrier, to the meninges to avoid them drying out while barrier dries, about 10 min. Continue to step 9.\nRemove slides from ethanol and dry at RT for 5 min. Using a hydrophobic barrier pen, draw a border around the tissue on the slide. Dry completely at RT, at least 10 min. A continuous barrier is required for steps 9–13 of the RNA FISH protocol and steps 14–18 of the immunohistochemistry protocol.\nPause point: It is possible to leave the slides at RT O/N and continue the assay the next day.\nNote: Before starting steps 9–12, make sure the hybridization oven is set to 40°C and contains the humidity control tray with a wet filter paper, allow to equilibrate for 30 min. Oven should be set to 40°C for all incubation steps.\nTransfer slides to the HybEz II hybridization system slide holder. Add 4–5 drops of Protease Plus to each slide and incubate for 15–30 min at 40°C in the hybridization oven. Rinse slides in distilled water. Repeat rinse with fresh distilled water.\nNote: During protease incubation, remove desired probes from the fridge, warm to 40°C (about 10 min) in an incubator and then cool to RT.",
    "Note: For RNA FISH alone, 15 min of protease digestion is sufficient. If also performing immunohistochemistry using antibodies, protease digestion time will need to be optimized. In our hands, we achieved the best results using a protease digestion of 15 (anti-CD31 antibody) to 30 min (anti-IBA1 antibody).\nRemove excess liquid from slides by holding the slide holder vertically and carefully dabbing the lower portion of each hydrophobic area with a piece of tissue.\nAdd 100–150 μL (4–6 drops) probe mixture to each sample so that the tissue is completely covered.\nIncubate in hybridization oven for 2 h.\nWash slides, still locked in slide holder, in 200 mL 1× wash buffer for 2 min with gentle agitation. Repeat wash. Unless otherwise noted, all subsequent washes are performed similarly.\nNote: Probes must be mixed to the correct concentration before use. Channel 1 (C1) probes come at a ready-to-use concentration while C2 and C3 probes must be diluted 1:50 in the C1 probe or in probe diluent if no C1 probe is used.\nNote: During probe hybridization, remove AMPs and HRPs from the fridge and equilibrate to RT.\nHybridize AMPs:\nRemove excess liquid from slides and add 4–6 drops AMP1, incubate in the hybridization oven for 30 min.\nWash slides with 1× wash buffer.\nRemove excess liquid and add 4–6 drops AMP2. Incubate in hybridization oven for 30 min.\nWash slides with 1× wash buffer.\nRemove excess liquid. Add 4–6 drops AMP3 and incubate in hybridization oven for 15 min.\nWash slides with 1× wash buffer.\nNote: During AMP3 hybridization, remove desired Opal dye from fridge and equilibrate to RT, in the dark.\nDevelop HRP signal:\nRemove excess liquid and add 4–6 drops of the correct HRP (e.g., HRP-C1 if probe is in C1) to the slides.",
    "Incubate in the hybridization oven for 15 min.\nWash slides with 1× wash buffer.\nRemove excess liquid, add 100–150 μL of the appropriate Opal dye (as substrate for HRP).\nIncubate in the hybridization oven for 30 min.\nWash slides with 1× wash buffer.\nRemove excess liquid, add 4–6 drops HRP blocker to each slide.\nIncubate in the hybridization oven for 15 min.\nWash slides with 1× wash buffer.\nIf using more than one probe, repeat step 12 with other HRPs and opal dyes.\nNote: Any Opal dye color can be assigned to any probe channel. We have used the Opal 520, Opal 570 and Opal 690 dyes. After being reconstituted following manufacturers’ directions, dyes are used at a dilution of 1:1500, diluted in TSA buffer.\nNote: Once opal dyes have been added to the sample, make sure to protect the sample from light as much as possible.\nNote: If meninges detach from the microscope slide during the staining, refer to troubleshooting problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\nOptional: If desired, perform immunohistochemistry at this point, starting at step 14 below.\nCounterstain and mount slides:\nRemove excess liquid and add a few drops of DAPI to the slide. Incubate for 30 s at RT.\nTap off excess DAPI and mount slides using a coverslip and mounting medium, e.g., ProLong Glass Antifade Mountant.\nLet slides cure, protected from light, O/N at RT before viewing.\nPerform optional immunohistochemistry\nTiming: 4 h\nImmunohistochemistry allows for the visualization of proteins in the meningeal whole mounts.\nThis protocol follows the manufacturer's protocol, with a few modifications, and can be found using the following link (document #323100-TN). https://acdbio.com/sites/default/files/323100-TN%20Multiplex%20Fluorescent%20V2%20with%20IF_incOpal780.pdf[href=https://acdbio.com/sites/default/files/323100-TN%20Multiplex%20Fluorescent%20V2%20with%20IF_incOpal780.pdf]\nBlock tissue:\nFollowing the last HRP-blocker step and washes (step 12 above), wash slides two times with TBST wash buffer for two min each.\nAdd 100–150 μL 10% normal serum diluted in TBSB.",
    "Incubate at RT for 30 min, protected from light, in a humidity chamber.\nNote: For optimal blocking, use serum from the same species where the secondary antibody was raised.\nAdd primary antibody:\nTap slides to remove excess blocking solution and add 100–150 μL primary antibody diluted in TBSB within the hydrophobic barrier.\nIncubate for 2 h at RT, protected from light, in a humidified chamber.\nWash slides in TBST with gentle agitation three times for 5 min each.\nNote: Primary antibody incubation time and dilution should be adjusted to optimize staining and minimize background.\nAdd secondary antibody:\nAdd 100–150 μL HRP-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in TBSB.\nIncubate for 30 min at RT.\nWash slides in TBST with gentle agitation three times for 5 min each.\nAdd Opal reagent:\nAdd 100–150 μL of the appropriate Opal dye diluted in TSA buffer to each sample.\nIncubate for 10 min at RT.\nWash slides in TBST with gentle agitation three times for 2 min each.\nCounterstain and mount slides as described in step 13 above.\nImage slides\nTiming: 1–4 h\nImage slides in a fluorescence microscope to visualize mRNA and protein expression.\nImage slides using a fluorescence microscope equipped with an appropriate light source and filter sets.
