First condition: PDGF-BB a potent myogenic cytokine which has been found to be increased in brains of patients with AD (Barroeta-Espar et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). Second condition: the mutant Tau P301L which is associated with dementia and neurogenerative tauopathies (Lathuilière et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). And third condition: LPS which is a lipopolysaccharide associated with amyloid plaques formation (Lee et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nHuman primary VSMCs detachment\nAspirate the medium from the culture plates.\nAdd 5 mL of PBS and gently swirl it to remove traces of serum from the culture medium.\nAdd 5 mL of Trypsin/EDTA solution.\nRemove 4 mL of the solution immediately.\nMonitor the trypsinization progress at room temperature under an inverted microscope.\nNote: If rounded cells are attached to the cell surface, release them by hitting the side of the plate against your palm until most of the cells are detached.\nAdd 5 mL of neutralizing Solution and transfer the solution into a 50 mL sterile conical tube.\nNote: Examine the plate under a microscope. If there are >20% cells left in the plate, repeat steps b–f.\nCentrifuge the conical tube at 220 × g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant from the tube without disturbing the cell pellet.\nFlick the tip of the conical tube with your finger to loosen the cell pellet.\nResuspend the cells in 5 mL of Smooth Muscle Cell Growth Medium by gently pipetting the cells to break up the clumps.\nCount the cells with a hemocytometer.",

    "Note: Dysfunctional VSMCs should show increased expression of the following synthetic markers: COL6A3, MMP9, GJA1, MMP2, COL1A1, MYH10. And decreased expression of the following contractile markers: CNN1, MYH11, TAGLN (SM22-α), SMTN1, ACTA2 (Lino Cardenas et al., 2018a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5], 2018b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6], 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nMorphologic characterization of dysfunctional VSMCs by microscopy\nSeed enough cells in an 8-well microscopy slides until obtain 50% confluency and allow them to acclimate for 24 h before initiate treatment.\nReplace with 2 mL of fresh growth medium containing PDGFBB, Tau P301 or LPS.

    "Functional assays are useful to investigate the effect of a given stimulus on the behavior of a cell population, including cell migration, invasion, proliferation, and survival. Example of these assays are the wound healing assay and the transwell assay. Herein, we use these assays to evaluate the effect that dysfunctional VSMCs could have on the migration capability of microglial cells. We also evaluated the paracrine VSMC-mediated activation of microglial cells with a co-culture and supernatant assays.\nWound healing assay\nAdjust cellular concentration of VSMCs or microglia to 0.5-× 106 cells/mL using cell culture media (Cat#311-500 to VMSCs and Cat# 1901 to Microglia).\nSeed 250 μL of VSMCs or microglia into the silicone insert (included in kit Cat#CBA-120-5).\nStain VSMCs with CellTracker Green CMFDA and microglia cells with CellTracker Deep Red Dye overnight (16 h), following the manufacturer’s instructions (https://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/celltracker_fluorescent_probes_man.pdf[href=https://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/celltracker_fluorescent_probes_man.pdf]). For nuclear staining use Nucblue live cell stain, 2 drops per mL for 16 h.\nFor VSMCs add fresh 100 μL of medium containing neurotoxins as indicated above (Step two; generation of dysfunctional VSMCs). For microglia cells also add fresh 100 μL growth normal medium containing neurotoxins. Maintain the cells for 72 h in the incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nUsing a sterile forceps remove the silicone insert from the plate well to begin the wound healing assay under normal growth medium.\nVisualize wells under a fluorescence microscope after 0, 12, 24, 48 h, focusing on the center of the wound field. Maintain the cells for 48 h in the incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2 and image on 10× until cells migrate to close the empty gap (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nNote: 5 technical replicates per condition should be performed to achieve representative and significant data.\nNote: Avoid bumping and moving the inserts.",
    "Note: Carefully follow the manufacturer’s instructions of the 24-well plate to ensure that the inserts are correctly oriented and have a firm contact with the bottom of the plate well (https://www.cellbiolabs.com/sites/default/files/CBA-120-wound-healing-assay.pdf[href=https://www.cellbiolabs.com/sites/default/files/CBA-120-wound-healing-assay.pdf]).\nNote: Avoid twisting the insert as this will damage the wound field.\nTranswell assay\nSeed 0.2 × 106 VSMCs at the bottom and 0.2 × 106 microglia cells on the top of a Transwell-12 plate. For VSMCs incubate with neurotoxins as indicated in the \"generation of dysfunctional VSMCs”.\nAfter 72 h, add 300 μL fresh normal growth medium to VSMCs and label microglia cells overnight (16 h) with CellTracker Deep Red Dye followed by a change of 300 μL fresh growth media.\nPosition the insert containing microglia cells on top of VSMCs. Make sure that the insert merged in medium and maintain the cells for 16 h in the incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nRemove the top insert and wash the bottom compartment with 300 μL PBS before fixation with 300 μL of 4% of formaldehyde for 10 min.\nWash the cells three times with 300 μL PBS.\nThe migration of microglia cells should be quantified as the number of red cells migrated towards VSMCs. Imaging with fluorescent microscope at 10× (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nNote: 5 technical replicates per condition should be performed to achieve representative and significant data.\nCo-culture assay\nSeed 0.2 × 106 VSMCs on a 12-well plate followed by incubation with neurotoxins as indicated in the section “generation of dysfunctional VSMCs”. In parallel, seed 0.2 × 106 microglia on a 12-well plate under normal growth conditions (final volume 500 μL).\nLabel VSMCs with CellTracker Deep Red Dye and microglia with Nucblue live cell stain (2 drops per mL) overnight (16 h) followed by a change of 500 μL of fresh growth media.",
    "Trypsinize VSMCs, resuspend cell in normal growth media and count cells.\nThen seed 0.2–0.3 × 106 VSMCs on top of microglia under normal growth conditions for 48 h.\nWash 3 times with PBS and fix cells with 4% of formaldehyde for 10 min, follow by immunostaining of MHC-II or desire cell marker of activated microglia. Imaging (40×).\nNote: Primary antibody against (MHC-II) should be used at 1:100 dilution overnight (16 h) at 4°C, and secondary AF488 at 1:400 dilution (45 min, room temperature). This combination may allow the use of 3 fluorophores (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nSupernatant assay to evaluate the activation of healthy microglia\nCell culture supernatant assay\nSeed 0.2 × 106 VSMCs on a 12-well plate and incubate them with 2 mL of neurotoxins or fresh normal media for microglia (0.2 × 106) as indicated in the section “generation of dysfunctional VSMCs”.\nAdd 2 mL of fresh media and incubate for 24 h\nCarefully aspirate supernatant into a sterile 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. Spin down at 1000 × g for 2 min and use 500 uL of the supernatant to stimulate microglia (from step a) for 24 h in the incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nWash three times with 1 mL of PBS and fix cells with 4% of formaldehyde for 10 min.\nPermeabilize cells with 0.5% of triton-x for 10 min and blocked with donkey serum at 10% for 1h followed by primary antibody (IL-6) incubation at 4°C overnight (16 h).\nUse desire secondary antibody and incubate 45 min at room temperature.\nMount slides with diamond mounting medium containing DAPI.\nVisualize cells with the Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscopy station and digitize pictures with the Leica Application Suite X software. Analyze two-dimensional and white-light images and quantify them using ImageJ software (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).",
