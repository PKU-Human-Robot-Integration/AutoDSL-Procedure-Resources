    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMouse intracardiac perfusion\nTiming: 15 min\nTo eliminate circulating blood cells, the euthanized mouse is intracardially perfused. Of note, histochemistry also helps distinguish cells located in the dura mater versus cells within the blood vessel lumen.\nEuthanize the mouse.\nUse an intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of ketamine and xylazine cocktail. Inject 0.9 mL of cocktail for a 30 g mouse (ketamine 300 mg/kg body weight and xylazine 30 mg/kg of body weight) with a syringe equipped with a 26G × ½ inch needle.\nWait for the mouse to be unresponsive to a toe pinch. This should take around 5 min.\nPlace the mouse on its back and pin each limb down to the dissection board. Spray ethanol 70% on the mouse abdomen to clean the area.\nPerform intracardiac perfusion.\nOpen the mouse abdomen with scissors and cut up to the thorax. Carefully expose the heart without cutting any major blood vessels.\nOnce you have exposed the heart, make a cut in the right atrium to let the blood flow.\nInject the left ventricle of the heart with a 20 mL syringe equipped with a 23G × 1 inch needle filled with ice-cold PBS 1×. At the end of the perfusion, the liver should have whitened.\nIsolation of mouse dural meninges\nTiming: 5 min\nIn this section, we describe how to recover the mouse dural meninges from the skull.\nDecapitate the mouse.\nUsing scissors, cut and remove the scalp until the skull is fully visible.\nCut the skull in the longitudinal plane from the back of the head to the nose, without damaging the brain.\nThe skull cap should be extracted without difficulty.\nThe brain should come with the skull cap.",
    "Gently extract the brain from the skull using forceps without scraping the inside of the skull. Dural meninges are now accessible inside the skull.\nFor flow cytometry, go to step 8 and for meningeal whole mount immunochemistry, go to step 20.\nFlow cytometry of dural meninges\nTiming: 2 h\nIn this section, we describe how to obtain single-cell suspension from mouse dural meninges and how to process and analyze the cells by flow cytometry.\nGently extract the meninges from the skull with fine-tipped forceps. For flow cytometry, the meninges should come in one piece (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) and can be put in the enzymatic mix on ice until digestion.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2487-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Separation of mouse skull, fresh dural meninges and brain\nCritical: be careful to take the entire dura and no bone or brain tissue. Keep the dura hydrated using PBS 1× frequently.\nDigest the meningeal tissue in the enzymatic mix at 37°C during 30 min in the water bath.\nGently shake the tube every 10 min.\nCritical: Over-digestion will lead to reduced cell viability.\nAfter 30 min, stop the digestion.\nDissociate the tissue by 20 recurrent aspirations through a 1,000 μL tip.\nPass the cellular suspension through a 35-μm pore cell strainer capped tube.\nSpin at 450 g at 4°C for 2 min, then remove most of the supernatant and leave 200 μL of cell suspension.\nTransfer this suspension in a 96-V bottom well plate for staining and wash two times with 100 μL of FACS Buffer (spin at 450 g at 4°C for 2 min, then remove supernatant).\nCritical: The pellet can be hard to see. Process carefully to avoid losing cells.\nStain with the viability marker for 15 min at 4°C. Wash with FACS Buffer (spin at 450 g at 4°C for 2 min, then remove supernatant).",
    "Block cell suspension with 50 μL of blocking solution for 10 min on ice.\nAdd 50 μL of the antibody cocktail (2×) for 30 min on ice and keep in the dark.\nWash two times with FACS Buffer (spin at 450 g at 4°C for 2 min, then remove supernatant).\nResuspend in 150 μL of FACS Buffer.\nAcquire the samples on the cytometer.\nNote: Make sure to use a cytometer compatible with the fluorochromes used in this protocol.\nAnalyze the results (gating strategy in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and cell counts in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2487-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Flow cytometry analysis of dural meninges\n(A) Gating strategy for dural meninges by flow cytometry. This allows to identify neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages (macs), CD11b+ DC, CD11b- DC, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, NKT/ILC1 cells and NK cells.\n(B) Expected counts of the cell populations in 6 weeks old B6 mice, based on the previous gating strategy. Bar graphs show the mean ± SEM.\nWhole mount immunohistochemistry of mouse dural meninges\nTiming: 2 days\nIn this section we describe how to stain the dural meninges for the viral nuclear protein of LCMV. This has to be done on different samples than the ones used for flow cytometry.\nFix the skull containing the dural meninges for 10 min with formalin 5% at 25°C.\nNote: This low fixation time is used for LCMV staining and should be adapted depending on the targeted epitope.\nWash 3 times with 1 mL of PBS 1×. Each wash should be left 1 min.\nIncubate dural meninges in 1.5 mL of blocking solution at 25°C for 15 min.\nExtract gently the meninges from the skull with fine-tipped forceps (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nSpread out and flatten the meninges on a glass slide in PBS 1× (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).",
    "Circle the meninges with a hydrophobic pen to keep the solution from spreading on the slide.\nFor the duration of the stain, keep your slices away from light and in a moisturized chamber. This will prevent the meninges from drying.\nCritical: The meningeal tissue can easily be lost if moved around too much as it is very small and almost transparent. Ensure the meningeal tissue stays flattened on the slide.\nStain the meninges with the primary antibody mix described in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] using the purified rat anti-LCMV antibody, 12 h at 4°C.\nWash 3 times with 200 μL of PBS 1×. Each wash should be left 1 min.\nCritical: Be really cautious to keep the integrity of the meninges.\nStain with the secondary antibody goat anti-rat Alexa Fluor 568 for 2 h at 25°C.\nWash 3 times with 200 μL PBS 1×. Each wash should be left 1 min.\nCritical: be really cautious to keep the integrity of the meninges.\nFinally, mount the meninges with a cover-slip and mounting medium.\nPut a dot of nail polish at each corner of the cover-slip to stabilize it.\nLet the meninges dry at 25°C 2 h before imaging."
