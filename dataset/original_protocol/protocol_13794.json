  "procedures": [
    "All procedures were conducted with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at the Medical University of South Carolina and the Ralph H. Johnson Medical Center. C57BL/6J male mice between 8-10 weeks of age were used in this study. Mice were housed under a standard 12 light/ 12 dark cycle with ad libitumaccess to food and water.\n1. Preparation of TNBS solution for injection\nPrepare 10% ethanol in 0.9% saline. Dissolve stock TNBS (see Table of Materials) in 10% ethanol to a final concentration of 7.5 mM by adding 7.5 µL of TNBS into 1 mL of 10% ethanol.\n\tCAUTION: TNBS presents a chemical hazard. Prepare the solution inside a fume hood and use personal protective equipment such as gloves, goggles, and a lab coat to avoid direct contact with TNBS.\nLoad 50 µL of 0.75% TNBS solution into an insulin syringe with a 31-gauge needle. Load 50 µL of 10% ethanol in saline into a syringe of the same size as vehicle control. Place the syringes on ice and protect them from light until needed.\n2. Mouse preparation and surgery\nShave the hair from the abdominal surgical area.\nInject one pre-emptive dose of the analgesic (e.g., buprenorphine 0.1 mg/kg i.p.) before surgery.\nInduce and maintain the mouse under general anesthesia with 1.5-2% isoflurane and 1 L/min of oxygen. Confirm the anesthetization by pinching the toes and observing the animal for a lack of reflex.\nPlace the mouse on a heated surgical pad during surgery. Apply veterinary ointment on each eye when the mouse is under anesthesia.\nDisinfect the surgical site by wiping the surgical area 3x with 2% iodine, followed by 70% alcohol (Table of Materials).\nPerform a laparotomy with micro scissors to generate a 0.5-1 cm incision.",
    "Gently expose the duodenum and locate the common bile duct using cotton swabs (Table of Materials).\nPlace a straight micro hemo clip (Table of Materials) over the proximal common duct to prevent the flow of TNBS or vehicle solutions into the liver and the gallbladder (Figure 1A, B).\nGently expose the duodenum and insert the needle into the pancreatic duct through the papilla of Vater.\nOnce the needle is inside the duct, place a curved micro hemo clip (Table of Materials) over the duodenum surrounding the needle (Figure 1A) to secure the needle in place and prevent the injected solution from entering the duodenum.\nGradually infuse the solution (TNBS or vehicle) into the pancreatic duct over the course of one min.\n\tNOTE: TNBS needs to be infused slowly over one min of time, and it is easy to control the infusion speed when the pancreas is perfused with an insulin syringe with a 5/16 inch and 31G needle. Keep the hand as stable as possible to avoid pricking the bile duct. If TNBS is successfully injected, yellow color may be visible inside the pancreas.\nAfter infusion, carefully remove the micro clamp near the liver, and then remove the micro clamp holding the needle and the duodenum.\nCarefully return the duodenum to its original position.\nLeave 0.5 mL of warm sterile saline (36-37 °C) in the abdominal cavity before closure, to help the duodenum return to its original position and assist with the recovery of peristalsis.\nClose the incision in the muscle layer using continuous suture with a 5-0 stitch. Close the skin using interrupted suture with a 4-0 stitch.\nPlace the cage containing mice on a heating pad to allow recovery from the anesthesia.",
    "Confirm that the mice are warm and capable of spontaneous movement before returning them to the holding room.\nContinue to provide an analgesic (e.g., buprenorphine 0.1 mg/kg i.p.) every 12 h and supplemental heat for 48 h post-surgery.\n3. Monitoring mouse behavior\nRemove sutures at day 7 post-surgery.\nMonitor mouse health and behavior daily during the first-week post-surgery. Watch for signs of distress such as vocalizing, hunched back posture, or reduced locomotion. Measure the body weight every other day.\nUse Von Frey monofilaments (VFFs) to measure abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity before, and 2, 3 weeks post-surgery as described9,14.\n\t\nApply VFFs of different applied forces in the ascending order to the upper abdominal area 10x every 1-2 s. Consider the raising, retraction, or licking of the abdomen (withdrawal response) as a positive response.\nApply a stronger stimulus if a positive response is not observed, and a weaker stimulus if a positive response is observed. The withdrawal threshold is the force at which the mouse responds 50% of the time.\n4. Collection and histological analysis of pancreatic tissue\nSacrifice the mice under anesthesia by cervical dislocation, and carefully dissect the pancreas from the intestine and other organs.\nFix the pancreas in 10% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, embed in paraffin, cut tissue sections of 5 µm thickness, and place them on glass slides for staining.\nPerform hematoxylin-eosin, and Masson's trichrome staining using standard methods as previously reported4.\nSubscription Required.
