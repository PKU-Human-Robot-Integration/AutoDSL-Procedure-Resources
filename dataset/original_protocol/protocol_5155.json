    "Treadmill exhaustion testTrainingSet the treadmill to desired angle of inclination or declination. In this instrument the angle of inclination is set by the location of the spring pin in holes of the inclination rod. Uphill inclinations (slopes of 10%) are commonly used for this test (Bi et al., 2016; Nie et al., 2016; Yue et al., 2016). Uphill running involves concentric muscle contraction and increases the muscle work for the animals as compared with running on a flat surface, leading to faster exhaustion. Downhill running may also be used to examine eccentric muscle contraction.Place a plastic tray underneath the instrument to collect feces and urine that could be produced during the test.Insert the lane dividers into the slots of the treadmill.Switch on the treadmill controller. Adjust the electric shock frequency and intensity (Figure 3A). In this apparatus, the electric stimuli are pulses (200 msec/pulse) of electric current with adjustable pulse repetition rate (1, 2 or 3 times per second, Hz) and intensity (suggested: 3 Hz, 1.22 mA; respectively).Place the mice on the treadmill belt and cover with the lid. Turn the shock grids on for each line by setting each toggle switch toward the grids (the stimulus indicator will begin to flash).Adjust the belt speed to 10 m/min using the ‘speed’ knob located in the treadmill controller. Set the ‘treadmill belt’ toggle switch to ‘run’ (Figure 3B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170413/20170413195044_8108.jpgFigure 3. Electric shock stimulus (A) and speed (B) adjustment using the treadmill controllerStart a timer. Allow mice to run for 5 min. After this time, set the ‘treadmill belt’ toggle back to ‘stop’.Disable the shock stimulus for all lanes.Remove animals and return each mouse to its cage.Clean the treadmill belt and grid with 70% ethanol and repeat steps A1f to A1l if additional mice have to be trained.Turn off the machine.",
    "Wash the feces collecting tray and the lane dividers. Repeat the training session during 3 consecutive days prior to the test.TestPerform the steps A1a through A1e of the previous section.Turn on the computer and start the treadmill software. Setup a new experiment as follows:Select ‘Experiment >> Run’ from the main menu.Click the ‘Profile Mode’ tab at the top of the window.Use the computer mouse to select the text boxes and enter the corresponding parameters (see Table 1, Figure 4A). In this test, the speed is initially set at 10 m/min for 5 min, and it is increased 2 m/min every 2 min up to a maximum speed of 46 m/min is reached (Bi et al., 2016).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170413/20170413195246_9429.jpgFigure 4. Treadmill Software. A. Creating a profile. A Treadmill exercise profile is created by selecting the text (white) boxes with the computer mouse and manually entering the corresponding parameters; more steps are added by clicking ‘add period’. This profile can be saved and used later to test other mice. To do this, click ‘Load’ in the profile mode screen and select the saved file. B. Running the experiment. A graphical representation is automatically generated to show the relative speed and time of the entire profile. The vertical red bar in the graph points out the current position, while an arrow within the step column of the profile table marks the step currently in use. Step time: informs about the time remaining within the current step; Spd (m/m): reports the current speed of the treadmill belt; Dist Tr (m): reports the total distance the treadmill belt has moved.Table 1. Treadmill exhaustion test stepsimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170413/20170413201816_8995.jpgSet the ‘Treadmill belt’ toggle switch to ‘Run’ and enable the electric shock.Click the ‘Start’ button. A ‘Save Experiment Data File’ window will open (save as a .csv file).",
    "Load the mice into separate lanes on the treadmill belt and then click ‘OK’.Run the experiment until the mice are exhausted or the maximal speed is achieved.  When a mouse becomes exhausted, write down the time, speed, and distance that are displayed at that moment on the screen (see Figure 4B) and turn off the shock grid for its lane. Remove the mouse from the treadmill.There are different ways to define exhaustion and the same criteria must be used throughout the experiment. For example, the exhaustion may be defined as the inability of the animal to run on the treadmill for 10 sec despite mechanical prodding (Bi et al., 2016; Yue et al., 2016).When no mice remain on the treadmill or the maximal speed is reached, stop the experiment and turn off the shock grids.To test additional mice clean the treadmill and grid with 70% alcohol and repeat the described procedure. (Click ‘Load’ in the profile mode screen and select the saved file generated previously in order not to have to enter again all the data manually, then click ‘Start’). Each mouse is tested one time the day after the last training session. We recommend to use at least five animals to ensure high statistical power. Due to potential variances in the sex, age, and genetic background of mice, calculation of the number of animals required for this test should be performed by a power analysis.Whole-limb grip strength assayPlace the mice in the testing room for 10 min to acclimate (leave the room during this time).Put the force meter on a firm, flat surface.Connect the grid to the digital force gauge and clean it with 70% ethanol or disinfectant wipe.Set up the grip strength meter (GSM):Turn on the GSM.",
    "Push the bottom under the ‘Mode’ option to select the Peak Tension (T-PK) mode (this displays the peak force applied to the GSM as a result of pulling away from the GSM). Press ‘Home’ to return to the main screen.Press the ‘Units’ bottom to select the units of force (e.g., Newton, N)Press ‘Zero’ to tare the GSM.Testing animals (Figure 5):Remove the mouse to be tested from the cage and place it over the top of the grid. Allow the mouse to grasp the grid with all four paws. The mouse can be held by the base of the tail alone or together with the scruff of the neck when positioning on the grid, be aware of doing it smoothly without pressing down upon the grid. Keeping the torso of the mouse parallel with the grid, pull gently the animal backwards away from the grid by the tail (pulling along the axis of the GSM). The speed has to be slow enough to let the mouse to develop a resistance against the pulling force. Record the number (peak force) that is displayed on the screen of the GSM once the mouse releases the grid.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170413/20170413200013_2167.jpgFigure 5. Whole-limbs grip strength measurementWeigh the mouse.Return the mouse to its cage.Clean the grid with 70% ethanol.Tare (zero) the GSM and proceed with the next subject. Each mouse should be tested several times (3-5 times) with at least 1 min resting period between each test."
