    "NOTE: Design, conduct and reporting of animal experiments should take account of current guidelines 24. Such work must be approved in advance by the local animal welfare authority (in our case the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of Sydney).\n1. Euthanasia of the Animal and Muscle Dissection\nTransfer the mouse from the holding room to a separate room where it is euthanized with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbitone solution (30 mg/kg) using the mouse handling method detailed by Shimizu 25. Place the mouse back into its cage.\nOnce the breathing of the mouse has stopped for more than 1 min, test the foot-withdrawal reflex by gently pinching the foot, and the corneal reflex by lightly brushing the cornea. Only when reflex responses are absent can the mouse be prepared for dissection.\nConsult an atlas of rodent anatomy such as Chiasson 26 and/or seek the help of an experienced anatomist before attempting dissection of the muscle of interest. In each case remove hair from the overlying skin using a small electric shaver before opening the skin to expose the muscle.\n\tNOTE: The dissection will differ for each anatomically-distinct muscle.\nUsing blunt forceps free the muscle from overlying membranes and surrounding tissues. Grasp and cut the distal tendon to separate the muscle from its insertion.\nGently tease and snip the muscle free from surrounding tissue right back to its origin. Briefly place the newly dissected muscle into 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution or Ringer’s Solution prior to further processing.\n2. Preparing the Muscle for Cryosectioning",
    "NOTE: Optimal structural preservation can be achieved by whole animal perfusion as previously detailed 27, or immersion fixation (for small muscles) as described in optional step 2.1. However, 4% paraformaldehyde fixation can impair subsequent staining with many antibody probes and with fluorescent-BGT. Glutaraldehyde particularly should be avoided. If muscles are not to be fixed they must be immediately snap frozen (proceed to 2.3).\nOptional immersion fixation: Pin the muscle to wax in a Petri dish at resting length. Cover the muscle with 2% w/v paraformaldehyde (freshly dissolved in PBS) for 2 hr at RT. Wash it with 3 changes of PBS over 30 min (3 x 10 min) then replace the PBS with 30% w/v sucrose in PBS and incubate O/N at 4 °C.\nMake molds ('boats') in advance by folding 2 cm x 1.5 cm pieces of aluminum foil as shown in Figure 1. Place a piece of nitrocellulose membrane in the bottom of the boat. Gently pour cryostat embedding matrix (Materials table) into the boat to a depth of 2 mm, taking care to avoid air bubbles. Place the muscle into the boat, aligning it with the ball-point pen lines on the nitrocellulose. Add more embedding matrix so as to completely cover the muscle (Figure 1).\nPre-label polypropylene tubes with an indelible marker. Place a drop of water in each tube and chill the tube in liquid nitrogen.\n\tNOTE: The frozen water drop maintains the vapor pressure and prevents desiccation during prolonged -80 °C storage",
    "Using a face shield, thick protective gloves and a large pair of blunt forceps, partially lower a small metal beaker (3 cm diameter, 8 cm deep) containing 2 cm depth of isopentane into a container of liquid nitrogen for 30 sec. Remove the beaker and place it on the bench top. Using a smaller pair of blunt forceps place the mold containing the muscle and embedding matrix into the chilled isopentane. Take care to avoid liquid nitrogen mixing with the isopentane.\nAllow 2 min for the block to freeze completely before using blunt forceps to lift the frozen block out and seal it in the correct pre-labeled and pre-chilled tube (step 2.3).\nStore the tubes temporarily in the liquid nitrogen prior to transfer to -80 °C. Log all samples in a spreadsheet of freezer contents.\n3. Cryosectioning and Fluorescence Staining for En Face Images of NMJs\nPeel away the aluminum mold. Within the -20 °C cryostat chamber attach the frozen block to the cryostat chuck so as to cut 20 μm cryosections parallel to the long axis of the muscle fibers (Figure 1). Pick up the sections on poly-L-lysine or gelatin coated microscope slides.\nNOTE: Omit this step if the tissue is fixed prior to freezing. After allowing 30 min for sections to dry onto the slides, fix them by placing a drop of 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS over each section for 15 min at RT.\nWash slides 3 x 10 min in PBS in a Coplin jar, and then immerse the slides in PBS containing 0.1 M glycine for 30 min to block residual aldehyde groups.",
    "Wash slides for 10 min in PBS, then immerse in methanol (chilled to -20 ºC) for 7 min. This permeabilization step is a routine part of double labeling with fluorescent-BGT and anti-synaptophysin but it may adversely affect immunostaining for some other proteins.\nWash slides 2 x 10 min in PBS then place each slide in a stable and leveled humidified chamber. Immediately cover each section with 20 µl of blocking solution (0.2% Triton X-100, 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS) for 1 hr at RT. Sections must not be allowed to dry out at any stage of the immunostaining process.\nCarry out the primary incubation: Taking one slide at a time carefully remove the excess blocking solution from over each section and replace it with 20 µl of rabbit anti-synaptophysin (diluted 1:200 in the blocking solution).\nInclude a negative-control slide that will be incubated with blocking solution only. This 'no-primary antibody control' is essential in every immunostaining run.\nTaking care that the primary antibody remains in place over each section, close the humidified chamber and incubate for 1-2 days at 4 ºC.\nInspect each section to confirm that the primary antibody remains in place. Use a Pasteur pipette to gently rinse each slide with PBS and place it in a Coplin jar. Wash all the slides 3 x 10 min in PBS.\nCarry out secondary incubation. Taking one slide at a time, carefully remove excess PBS, lay it in the humidified chamber and cover each section with 20 µl of a mixture containing FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and BGT conjugated to tetramethyl rhodamine or another red fluorophor (TRITC-/redBGT; 5 g/ml) diluted in blocking solution. Incubate at RT for 2 hr.\nWash slides 3 x 10 min in PBS in Coplin jars.",
    "Taking one slide at a time, carefully remove excess PBS and mount with a coverslip using a minimal volume of, glycerol-based, fade-resisting mounting medium. Seal the edges of the coverslips with clear nail varnish. Allow it to dry hard.\nStore the slides in the dark at 4 ºC for up to one week, or at -20 ºC for longer storage periods (up to several months).\n4. Unbiased Sampling and En Face Imaging of Motor Endplates\nBlind the slides by labeling each slide with a random code number that remains known only to a second researcher (not involved in the analysis). As a result the operator remains blind to treatment groups until quantitation of NMJ parameters is complete for all the samples.\nPlace the slide on the microscope stage and view it under wide field illumination with the TRITC filter set (63X oil 1.3 N.A. objective). Move progressively (field by field) left to right and back until an endplate appears in the field (Figure 2A).\n\tNOTE: Sampling criterion: Every AChR-stained structure that is relatively flat and faces the objective (i.e., extends <15 m in the z-dimension) is considered an endplate and is imaged for analysis (crescents of AChR staining represent cross-sections through endplates and are therefore excluded).\nWith the confocal pinhole set to 1.0 Airy unit and low laser power optimize the gain and offset levels for TRITC/red-BGT (532 nm laser) at the endplate that is to be imaged. Next optimize FITC/synaptophysin fluorescence using the 488 nm laser. Collect a z-stack of the endplate with a 0.7 μm interval between each optical slice. Save the images with a file name that includes the date of the imaging session, the code name of the slide and the number of the endplate.",
    "NOTE: The scans using the 488 nm and 532 nm lasers (FITC and TRITC) should be collected sequentially (not simultaneously) to avoid contamination of the FITC channel by fluorescence from the red fluorophore and vice versa (bleed-through).\nRepeat the sampling and imaging of steps 4.2-4.3 until 20 endplates are collected from the slide/sample.\nChange to the next coded slide and repeat 4.2-4.4. Repeat this for each of the coded slides.\nCollect a few images of endplates from the control slide (no-primary antibody control) using confocal settings that were found optimal for the experimental slides (the FITC fluorescence channel should appear dark).\nAt the end of the confocal session transfer the image files to another computer and back up the original files on an external drive or server.\n5. Measuring the Area of Synaptic Specializations in En Face Images\nUse NIH ImageJ freeware (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) to prepare maximum projection (MIP) images from each z-stack. Save them as tiff files (Figure 2A & B). Filenames should include the image session date, sample code, endplate number and fluorescent channel (e.g., 060414_5723_7_FITC.tiff ).\nOpen the z-projection image in ImageJ. Select the acetylcholine receptor image channel (Figure 3A) and select: Image > Type > 8-bit to convert the 24-bit RGB colored image into three 8-bit grayscale images on the screen.\nUsing the ImageJ polygon tool draw a rough outline around the endplate of interest in the redBGT stained (ACHR) channel so as to include all apparent stained regions of the particular individual endplate, whilst excluding any staining that does not originate from the endplate of interest (Figure 3C).\nApply a minimum intensity threshold to the image by selecting: Image > Adjust > Threshold (Figure 3E and associated ImageJ screenshots).",
    "Adjust the threshold level so as to isolate the AChR-stained portions while excluding surrounding background signal as sub-threshold (Figure 3E). Open a second window with the original (continuous-tone) image immediately beside the window for comparison, to facilitate the decision about the threshold value. Record the threshold value for later use in colocalization analyses.\nRetaining the polygon outline around the endplate select: Analyze > Analyze Particles. In the pop-up menu specify the range of sizes as: 50 to infinity pixels (this eliminates tiny artifacts arising from electrical noise in the photomultiplier).\nAnalyze Particles command generates a window with a list of discrete supra-threshold areas and their fluorescence intensity values numbered as they appear in the binary image (Figure 3G and associated ImageJ screenshot). Copy this data into a labeled spreadsheet.\nMeasure the Total endplate area (area within the polygon) by selecting: Analyze > Measure. This yields the total endplate area. Copy and paste the data for AChR areas and intensities into a spreadsheet making sure to label columns appropriately, rows will be used for individual endplates for specific slides.\nSwitch to the anti-synaptophysin fluorescence channel and repeat steps 5.1 - 5.5, but for the FITC channel (Figure 3B, D and F). The aim is to adjust the threshold so that it creates a binary image that, as closely as possible, matches the boundaries of staining as perceived by eye. Record the threshold value.\nMeasure the area of overlap by applying the following steps: Open the original file containing the two channel images and split it into two separate images by selecting: Image > Stacks > Stack to Images.",
    "Using the Colocalization plugin (downloaded and installed from the ImageJ webpage) Select: Pluggin > Colocalization and input the threshold values previously recorded for the AChR and nerve channels into the respective channel query box. This will yield an overlap image in white pixels (Figure 3H and associated ImageJ screenshots).\nConvert the newly created overlap image into a grayscale format and apply a threshold to the maximum value. The maximum threshold will only select the white pixels, corresponding to the overlap area of the two previous channels. Record in the spreadsheet the resulting area value of 'colocalization', which represents the area of overlap in pixels.\nPrepare a spreadsheet of data sample means, calculate and plot standard deviations and standard errors as histograms or scatterplots 20,22. Note that the value of n generally represents the number of mice per sample group for statistical purposes.\nPlot endplate AChR areas as scatterplots or frequency histograms to determine whether the data is normally distributed before statistical testing (Figure 6).\n6. Relative Staining Intensities Compared Using Transverse Optical Sections\nNOTE: For this protocol process all muscle samples together and image in a single confocal session. In planning an experiment allow up to 30 min imaging time per muscle sample.\nCut 15 µm cryosections transverse to the long axis of the muscle fibers and collect onto slides as described at step 3.1.\nCarry out fluorescence staining as described in steps 3.2-3.13.\nCode the stained slides so that imaging and analyses are undertaken with the operator blind to treatment group, as described in step 4.1.",
    "Using a 40X fluorescence objective (N.A. 0.75) briefly survey a section from each slide to determine a single gain and offset level setting for AChR that will be suitable for all the endplates across all sample slides. The brightest endplate should then be just below 256 grey on the scale. This optimization should be done separately for the second fluorescence channel (collected successively). Record the fixed gain and offset level settings and do not alter them throughout the imaging session.\nCollect images of a fluorescence standard slide (e.g., non-bleaching fluorescent beads), using the same parameters, at the beginning and end of the confocal session to detect any possible fluctuation in laser intensity.\nUse the AChR channel to scan the slide progressively to locate endplates.\nFocus to find the single optical section plane in each microscope field that contains the most number of AChR-stained endplates.\nScan this single optical section twice and save the averaged image (Figure 4G).\nKeeping the same focal plane switch to the second fluorescence channel (protein of interest) and collect the image as at step 6.8. Save the image file, including in the file name: date of imaging session, sample code, image number and a symbol to indicate the fluorescent channel. Figure 4A-F shows examples of the endplate distribution of AChR compared to rapsyn, MuSK or -dystroglycan (-DG).\nMove the stage to the next field that contains one or more endplates and repeat step 6.8-6.9. Repeat this until a total of 60 endplates are imaged.\nAt the end of the imaging session transfer all files to another computer and back them up.\nOpen each original image file and while viewing the AChR channel, select: Image > Stacks > Stack to Images, to split channels.",
    "Select: Image > Type > 8bit to convert to 8-bit grayscale format on the screen. Do this for both fluorescence channels.\nSelect: Image > Stacks > Images to Stack. Open a new stack from two previously separated 8-bit images. One can then switch conveniently between the two fluorescence channels within the single window.\nUse the polygon tool to draw a line tightly around the boundary of the AChR staining (Figure 4I).\nSelect: Analyze > Measure to measure the average pixel intensity for AChR within the enclosed area (note the importance of drawing the line tightly). Copy this value into a labeled spreadsheet.\nRetaining the same polygon outline (to define the area to be measured), switch to the second fluorescent channel (e.g., Figure 4B, D, F) and select: Analyze > measure. This will yield the average staining intensity for the protein of interest within the synaptic area defined by AChR staining.\nChoose an area away from visible endplate staining then select: Analyze > Measure to measure the average background fluorescence intensity. Repeat this for the other fluorescence channel/s and copy the background values into the spreadsheet of fluorescence values.\nSubtract the average background values from endplate values to obtain the corrected intensities for AChR and the protein of interest at each endplate.\nDivide the corrected endplate intensity values for the protein of interest by the corrected BGT fluorescence intensity to yield the fluorescence intensity ratios 14,21\n7. Comparing the Postsynaptic Membrane AChR Density Using FRET",
    "NOTE: This protocol assesses the extent to which AChRs are closely packed (<10 nm spacing) in the postsynaptic membrane. The precise donor and acceptor fluorophore combination is critical to this FRET assay. Names and details of the fluorophores are given in the Materials table. Their spectral properties, in relation to FRET, are discussed in our previous papers 14,15.\nPrepare fixed transverse cryosections as described in section 6.1. All sample groups must be processed together and imaged in the same confocal session.\nThoroughly mix 2.5 g/ml red-BGT (FRET donor) with 10 g/ml far red-BGT (FRET acceptor) with blocking solution in a small plastic tube by pipetting up and down 12 times. This 1:4 molar mixture maximizes the efficiency of FRET 14.\nPlace each slide in a humidified chamber, carefully cover each section with a drop (12 µl) of the above mixture and incubate for 1.5 hr at RT.\nControl sections: cover small numbers of sections with 2.5 g/ml red-BGT (donor only; labeled C1 controls), and also some sections with 10 g/ml far-red-BGT (acceptor only; labeled C2 controls). Incubate these controls as at step 7.3.\nWash slides 3 x 10 min in PBS and mount in glycerol-based, fade-resisting mounting medium (see step 3.12).\nPerform sampling of endplates as in step 6.7. Fluorescence from the donor and acceptor should be perfectly co-localized at endplates due to the random binding of the fluorescent-BGT molecules.\nControl images: Using the 40X objective and low laser power optimize redBGT gain and offset level settings for endplates from a control slide C1. Optimize far-redBGT gain and offset levels for endplates from control slide C2. Confirm the absence of any fluorescence bleed-through.\nWithout changing the laser power, gain or offset-level settings move to the experimental slides and collect images (pre-photobleach) for both fluorescence channels.",
    "Selectively photobleach the far-red-BGT over a portion of a single endplate by zooming in the scan area then scanning 10 times with the 633 nm laser at 100% power. The fluorescence in the scanned area should become dim.\nReset the laser power and zoom and collect post-bleach images on both fluorescent channels using the confocal settings established at 7.7.\nCalculate the FRET efficiency (E) from the percentage increase in donor (red-BGT) fluorescence following photobleach of the acceptor (far-red-BGT) according to the following formula*:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52220/52220eq1.jpg\n\t*For all situations where the fluorescence of the donor increases after photobleaching the acceptor.\nSubscription Required.
