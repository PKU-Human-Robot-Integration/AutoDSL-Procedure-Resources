    "Matrigel migration assay   Thaw matrigel matrix at 4 °C on ice overnight.   Dilute matrigel matrix at a ratio of 1:2 in cold DMEM/F12. Note: 1 ml of matrigel will be sufficient to prepare 12 wells of a 4 well dish.   Add 250 μl of the matrigel matrix mixture per well of a 4-well tissue culture dish and incubate in the cell culture incubator (at 37 °C) for at least 30 min for hardening. Note: Store pipet tips at -20 °C before using.   Trypsinize cells and count them using a counting chamber. Note: At this step cell suspension can be incubated with 0.1% DNAse to avoid cell clumping.   Pellet cells by centrifugation at 300 x g for 4 min.   Remove supernatant and resuspend 100,000 cells/µl in cell culture media (e.g. Neuronal media containing DMEM/F12 with one vol% N2 supplement and Neurobasal with two vol% B27 supplement mixed at a 1:1 ratio). Optional: Add 5 mM Rock inhibitor for cell survival.   Spot 1 µl of the cell suspension in the middle of the dish on the gel surface.  Note: Specified 4 well dishes have a very slight round bottom which supports precise spotting.   Incubate dishes for 10 min by carefully transferring them to the cell culture incubator until cells are attached.   Carefully cover the cells with respective cell culture media and cultivate them in the cell culture incubator until analysis.   Radial migration from the center of the cell clumps can be analyzed at different time points using static or live cell microscopy (see Figure 1).      Boyden chamber migration assay   Place Millicell culture plate inserts into 24 well plates and coat them from both sides with poly-l-ornithine. Incubate the culture plate for at least 2 h at 37 °C (e.g. in the cell culture incubator).",
    "Wash the 24 well dish with the millicell culture plate inserts 3 times with PBS followed by coating with laminin (1:1,000 diluted in PBS).   Wrap the dish with parafilm and store at least over night at 4 °C.  Note: Experiments should always be performed in triplicates.   Trypsinize cells and count them using a counting chamber. Note: At this step cell suspension can be incubated with DNAse to avoid cell clumping and filtered through a nylon mesh (before counting).    Pellet the cells at 300 x g for 4 min.    Remove the supernatant and resuspend 1 x 106 cells/ml in neural differentiation media.  Note: The media used should not contain any growth factors or cytokines.   Remove the coating suspension and load the bottom well of the chamber with 400-450 µl media with or without the chemoattractant of interest (e.g. 10 ng/ml VEGF or 10 ng/ml FGF2).  Notes:    It is crucial that the media in the bottom well is covering the bottom side of the membrane but should not rise to the upper side.    To avoid bubbles, carfully tip the pipette to the fringe of the chamber.   Use respective chemoattractive-blocking agents as control (e.g. VEGF receptor 1 and VEGF receptor 2 blocking antibodies and FGF2 neutralizing antibody).     Plate 100 µl of the cell suspension on the poly-l-ornithine/laminin coated membrane that separates the upper and the lower well.  Note: Do not touch the filter and avoid creating bubbles.    Place the chamber in the 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 6-20 h. The incubation time varies considerably depending on the cell type and chemotactic factor.   Fix the dish (with the millicell culture plate insert) with 4% PFA and wash twice with PBS.   Stain the upper and lower side of the membrane with DAPI.",
    "Note: Check under the fluorecence microscope whether cell destribution is uniform (on both the upper and lower side of the membrane) and proceed only with those membranes. Non-uniform distribution of cells is most likely due to incomplete coating of the membrane. Take care that the membrane is not getting dry during the coating (point 1-3).    Wipe off cells on the upper side of the membrane (non-migrated cells) with a cotton bud. Repeat this step at least twice.   Stain the millicell culture plate inserts (in the 24 well dish) for appropiate markers (e.g. ßIII tubulin to identify neurons, nestin for neural progenitors).   Cells reaching the bottom side of the membrane can be quantified under the flurecence microscope (Figure 2). Note: The millicell culture plate inserts can be placed on a glass object slide, use a drop of PBS to keep the membrane wet."
