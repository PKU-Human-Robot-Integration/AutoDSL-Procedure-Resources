    "1. Gene-trapped ES Cell Library Construction Using piggyBac Transposon\nPrepare primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PMEF) as feeders for ES cell culture\n\t\nThaw one vial of mitomycin C-inactivated PMEF (5.0 x 106) in a 37 °C water bath. Transfer the cells into 5 ml of ES cell medium (DMEM containing 15% FBS, 1,000 unit/ml of leukemia inhibitory factors, 100 µM nonessential amino acids, 2 mM glutamine, 55 µM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 25 unit/ml penicillin/streptomycin), and centrifuge at 100 x g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 30 ml of ES cell medium followed by distributing into two T25 flasks (5 ml each) and two 100-mm plates (10 ml each). Incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 hr.\nCulture and expand C9 ES cells\n\t\nThaw one vial of C9 ES cells (2.5 x 106 cells in 0.5 ml) in a 37 °C water bath and transfer the cells into 5 ml of ES cell medium. Centrifuge at 100 x g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend ES cells in 5 ml of ES cell medium followed by plating into the T25 feeder flask. Incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Replace ES cell medium daily.\nAfter 2 days of culture, the ES cells should become ~80% confluent, and are ready to be passaged. Wash cells with 5 ml of PBS (without Ca2+ and Mg2+) and then add 2.5 ml pre-warmed 0.25% trypsin-EDTA. Incubate at 37 °C for 10 min. Add 2.5 ml ES cell medium to stop trypsin; pipette up and down 15 times to break up cell clumps. Centrifuge at 100 x g for 5 min.",
    "Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend cells in 4 ml of ES cell medium. Transfer 1 ml of cells per 100-mm plate containing 9 ml ES cell medium; prepare two 100-mm plates. This is a 1:8 passage. Feed the cells daily with 10 ml ES cell medium.\nPrepare 96-well feeder plates for the library\n\t\nAs described in 1.1.1, thaw three vials of mitomycin-C inactivated PMEF (each containing 5 x 106 cells) and resuspend cells from each vial with 33.3 ml ES cell medium. Combine cells to yield a 100-ml cell suspension.\nPlate 100 µl cells per well onto ten 96-well plates. These 96-well feeder plates should be prepared at least one day before transfecting C9 ES cells with PB transposon.\nElectroporation of C9 ES cells with the PB-UPA vector\n\t\nTrypsinize and count the expanded C9 ES cells using an automated cell counter. Wash each 100-mm plate of C9 ES cells with 10 ml PBS. Add 8 ml pre-warmed 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and incubate at 37 °C for 10 min.\nStop trypsin by adding 2 ml ES cell medium. Transfer the cell suspension to a 15-ml tube and pipette up and down 15 times to break apart cell clumps. Immediately centrifuge at 100 x g for 5 min followed by aspirating the supernatant.\nResuspend cells in 10 ml ES cell medium and count the ES cells using a hemocytometer. Prepare six 15-ml tubes of cell suspension each containing 5 x 106 ES cells. Centrifuge at 100 x g for 5 min. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend each cell pellet in 0.8 ml PBS.",
    "Prepare six electroporation cuvettes (4 mm gap) to which the 0.8 ml cells are transferred. To each cuvette, add 1 µg PB-UPA and 20 µg mPB transposase (mPBase); mix gently by pipetting up and down. Put the cuvettes on ice. Perform electroporation with an electroporator using the exponential setting at 250 V, 500 µF, and infinity ohm.\n\t\tNOTE: Typically, the time constant is about 10 to 12 msec for a successful electroporation, which yield about 1,500 to 2,000 G418 resistant transformants per 5 x 106 cells.\nRetrieve and pool the transfected cells to a T75 flask containing 98 ml ES cell medium. Mix the cells by gentle pipetting and then transfer cells to a reservoir (50 ml). Using a 12-channel pipette, transfer 100 µl of cells per well to the previously prepared 96-well feeder plates (10 in total). Incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nAfter 24 hr, feed the cells daily with fresh ES cell medium containing G418 (150 µg/ml) to select for gene-trapped clones.\n\t\tNOTE: Typically each well will contain about ten G418 resistant colonies. When these colonies grow to sufficient size (typically 5-7 days), the 96-well plates (the library) will be replicated into 2 sets for storage and selection, respectively. Each plate in the library is designated as ‘sub-library’, so in this case, there are 10 sub-libraries.\n2. Library Replication\nReplicate the Master plates\n\t\n24-48 hr prior to the G418 resistant colonies reaching 50-60% confluency, thaw another three vials of mitomycin C-inactivated PMEF onto ten 96-well plates as feeders (refer to section 1.3). Gelatinize ten 96-well plates by incubating 0.1% gelatin (100 µl/well) at 37 °C for at least 15 – 30 min; O/N incubation is acceptable.",
    "Prepare single cell suspensions in the 96-well plates by trypsinization. Aspirate medium from 96-well plates and wash once with equal volume of PBS (without Ca2+, Mg2+). Add 50 µl of pre-warmed 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA, incubate at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 10 min. Stop trypsin with 50 µl of ES cell medium. Break apart the cell clumps by pipetting up and down 15 times with the multichannel pipette.\nTransfer 50 µl of trypsinized cell suspension to the corresponding row of the feeder plate (Master) already containing 150 µl ES cell medium and the remaining 50 µl to the corresponding row of the gelatinized plate (replica) already containing 150 µl ES cell medium. Process each row of cells to a Master and replica plate. Incubate the plates (now containing a 200 µl culture volume) at 37 °C, 5% CO2 O/N.\n\t\tNOTE: There are now twenty 96-well plates.\nThe next day feed the cells with 100 µl fresh ES cell medium containing 150 µg/ml G418. Replace the medium daily until the wells are 80-90% confluent.\nFreeze the Master plates\n\t\nWhen the master plates are about 80% confluent, trypsinize the cells as described (refer to section 2.1.2).\nRemove the plates and stop trypsin reaction with 50 µl of 2x freezing medium (60% ES cell medium, 20% FBS, 20% DMSO). Pipette up and down 10 times with a multichannel pipette to ensure proper mixing of the freezing medium.\nPut the 96-well plates in a tightly sealed styrofoam box and place it in -80 °C freezer for up to four months storage. Four months will allow enough time to complete the stress selection and to identify which wells from the Master plate contain the clones of interest.",
    "NOTE: Storage at -80 °C longer than 4 months will result in decline of cell viability. One may utilize cryo-tubes in 96-well format that can be stored in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen for extended period of storage.\nPrepare DNA plates and sub-library pools from replica plates\n\t\n24-48 hr prior to replicating further to DNA plates and sub-library pools, prepare ten 100-mm plates with mitomycin C-inactivated PMEF for the sub-library pool, and ten gelatinized 96-well plates for the DNA plate replicates. Refer to section 1.3 for general procedure.\nTrypsinize the cells in the 96-well replica plates (refer to section 2.1.2). During the 10 min trypsinization step, aspirate gelatin from the DNA plates and replace with 150 µl ES cell medium containing G418 (150 µg/ml). Also , prepare a reservoir containing 5 ml of ES cell medium for pooling of the ‘sub-libraries’ into the 100-mm feeder plate.\nFollowing trypsinization, stop trypsin with 50 µl of ES cell medium one row at a time using a 12-channel pipette.  Pipette up and down 10 times to break apart cell clumps.\nTransfer 50 µl of the cell suspension to the corresponding row of the DNA plate and transfer the remaining 50 µl to the reservoir containing 5 ml ES cell medium. After completing one full 96-well plate, aspirate the medium of a 100-mm feeder plate to which the pooled cells are transferred. These pooled mutagenized cells are designated as a ‘sub-library’.\nRepeat for the remaining nine 96-well plates. Feed the 96-well DNA plates and 100-mm pooled ‘sub-library’ plates daily with ES cell medium containing G418 (150 µg/ml).\n\t\tNOTE: There are now ten 96-well ‘DNA’ plates, and ten 100-mm ‘sub-library’ plates.",
    "Freeze the DNA plates. When the cells in the DNA plate are 80-90% confluent, aspirate the medium, wash the cells twice with 100 µl PBS and store at -20 °C for later genomic DNA isolation 6. These DNA plates will be screened by PCR to identify which corresponding well in the ‘Master’ plate contains the clone of interest.\n3. Doxycycline-induced Homozygous Mutants\nFreeze the sub-library pools and passage cells for doxycycline treatment\n\t\n24 hr prior to the 100-mm ‘sub-library’ plates having colonies large enough to yield 70-80% confluency, prepare a set of ten gelatinized 100-mm plates for doxycycline treatment.\nPrepare single cell suspensions of each sub-library (refer to sections 1.4.1 and 1.4.2 for details). Transfer 5 x 106 cells to the gelatinized 100-mm plate with doxycycline (1 µg/ml); incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Freeze the remaining non-doxycycline treated sub-library pools at 5 x 106 cells per vial.\nPassage cells in the presence of doxycycline to knock out Blm\n\t\nPassage the sub-libraries at 1:8 every 2-3 days in the presence of doxycycline (1 µg/ml) for up to two weeks, during which time dox-induced knock-out of Blm will promote loss of heterozygosity in the cell population, allowing for generation of homozygous mutants.\n4. Stress Selection and Isolation of Resistant Clones\nSubject doxycycline-treated cells for stress selection\n\t\n24 hr prior to passaging doxycycline treated cells for stress selection, prepare ten gelatinized 150-mm plates, place in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator.",
    "Prepare a single cell suspension of each sub-library by trypsinization (refer to section 1.4.1 and 1.4.2 for details). Seed 6.6 x 106 cells onto each 150-mm plate in 30 ml total culture volume, distribute cells evenly. Incubate cells with stressor (10 µM paraquat or omission of β-mercaptoethanol, in ES cell medium containing 7.5% heat inactivated FBS) for 7 days, after which replace with normal ES cell medium to allow surviving cells to grow into colonies for picking.\nOptional: Freeze the left over doxycycline-treated cells at 5.0 x 106 cells per vial.\nPick stress resistant colonies\n\t\nAfter reinstating normal media for a week, observe how many stress resistant colonies are present. Depending on the number of colonies to be picked, prepare enough wells with mitomycin C-inactivated PMEF on 96-well plates one day beforehand accordingly (refer to section 1.1 for details).  \nOn the day of picking, aspirate and replace medium in the 96-well feeder plate with 100 µl fresh ES cell medium, place back into 37 °C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator. At this time, prepare a U-bottom 96-well plate with 50 µl 0.25% trypsin-EDTA per well. Aspirate medium from the 150-mm stress selection plate and add equal volume of PBS.\nSet the micropipette to 2 µl, and ‘pick’ surviving colonies into the U-bottom trypsin containing wells, picking one colony per well. It is acceptable to let the plate sit at RT until the desired number of colonies has been picked. Then, incubate the U bottom plate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 10 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Typically, we take 1 hr to pick 96 colonies.",
    "Stop trypsin reaction one row at a time with 50 µl ES cell medium using a multichannel pipette. Pipette up and down 15 times to obtain a single cell suspension and transfer 100 µl of cells to the corresponding row of the feeder plate already containing 100 µl of ES cell medium. Complete the transfer for the entire plate. Culture cells O/N in 200 µl. The next morning, aspirate medium and replace with 100 µl ES cell medium.\nReplicate the 96-well plates\n\t\nWhen the wells of the picked colonies are 80-90% confluent, replicate into two matching plates, one for DNA isolation and the other for cells back-up. These plates are gelatinized and do not contain mitomycin C-inactivated PMEF.\nAspirate medium, and wash with 100 µl PBS. Add 50 µl 0.25% trypsin-EDTA to each well, incubate at 37 °C for 10 min. Stop the trypsin with 150 µl ES cell medium, mix by pipetting, and transfer 100 µl of cell suspension to the corresponding row of two 96-well plates. Change medium daily.\nWhen the plates are 80-90% confluent, freeze one set of plates as a ‘back-up’ (refer to section 2.2 for details). The other set of plates are further expanded as described below.\nExpanding cells for genomic DNA isolation\n\t\nPrepare a single cell suspension in the 96-well DNA plate (refer to 2.1.2 for details).\nTransfer cell suspension from each individual well of the 96-well plate to the well of a 24-well plate (4 total) using a micropipette. Ensure there is no cross contamination of any cells, as the ‘picked’ colonies are ‘clonal’ in origin. Culture cells in 0.5 ml ES cell medium, changing medium daily until wells are 80-90% confluent.\n\t\tNOTE: The 24-well plate will allow sufficient yield of genomic DNA for PCR analysis.",
    "5. Identification of the PB Insertion Sites and Trapped Genes\nGenomic DNA isolation from 24-well plate: Lyse cells in the 24-well plate and isolate RNA-free genomic DNA.\nPerform Splinkerette PCR (SpPCR) to generate sequence fragments flanking the PB transposon integration site as described 7,8.\n\tNOTE: SpPCR is a five day process, though hands-on time each day is minimal.\n6. Genetic Analysis of the Mutant Clones\nLocate master well and purify clone of interest.\n\t\nWhen the PB integration site has been mapped, design a forward primer upstream of the integration site to use with a PB reverse primer (e.g., PB3’-1) 8 and screen the DNA plate corresponding to the same ‘sub-library’ from which the stress resistant clone was picked. Expect to find only one positive well across the entire 96-well DNA plate. Thaw this exact well from the ‘Master’ plate to a 24-well plate on feeders and grow cells until 80-90% confluency.\n\t\tNOTE: At this point, this well contains a mixture of gene-trapped clones.\nWhen the 24-well plate is 80-90% confluent, trypsinize cells and plate 1,000 ES cells in a 100-mm feeder plate (ensure single cell suspension). Passage the remaining cells to a T25 flask on feeders for expansion. Freeze the cells from the T25 flask when colonies are 80-90% confluent. Freeze 4 vials per T25 flask as back-ups.\nAllow the colonies to grow for 7 days and then pick 96 colonies into a 96-well feeder plate. Refer to section 4.2 for picking procedure. Replicate the plate when ready into a ‘DNA’ plate and freeze the other as ‘2nd-master’ plate (refer to section 2.2 for freezing).",
    "Allow colonies to reach 80-90% confluency. Screen the DNA plate to find wells containing the purified clone of interest. Expand cells from the 96-well 2nd-master plate to 24-well and subsequently to a T25 flask (all on feeders). Freeze 4 vials per T25 flask.\n\t\tNOTE: At this point, the gene-trapped cell line is clonal, has not been exposed to the stressor, and is suitable for mouse production.\nDetermine the number of PB insertion: Thaw one vial of the stress resistant cell line and expand the cells in a gelatinized T25 flask. Isolate genomic DNA and check for copy number of the PB transposon. This can be achieved by qPCR targeting the neomycin gene.\nMeasure gene expression level: After confirming there is a single PB integration event in the cell line of interest, measure the level of expression of the trapped gene by RT-qPCR using specific Taqman probes for each gene.\nSequence the mutant mRNA: Generate a cDNA amplicon by PCR using an upstream primer annealing to an exon and a downstream primer annealing to the splice acceptor sequence of the gene trap cassette. Sequence the cDNA fragment to confirm that the expected splicing occurs in the trapped gene.\nRemobilize the piggyBac transposon to test for causal relationship between the trapped gene and stress resistance.\n\t\n24-48 hr prior to thawing cells for PB remobilization, thaw and plate DR4 feeders on one T25 flask and two 100-mm plates. At least one day after the DR4 feeders are plated onto the T25 flask, thaw one vial of the cell line containing the PB insertion and plate the cells in the T25 flask containing DR4 feeders. Grow the cells in ES cell medium for 48 hr, changing medium daily.",
    "Prepare a single cell suspension of the ES cells. Count cells with an automated cell counter, and transfer 5.0 x 106 ES cells to a 15-ml tube. Centrifuge at 100 x g, and resuspend the cells in 800 µl PBS. Transfer the suspension to a 4 mm cuvette.\nAdd 20 µg mPBasePuro to the cuvette, mix by pipetting, and electroporate cells (refer to section 1.4 for details). Distribute the transfected cells onto two 100-mm DR4 feeder plates. Culture cells O/N in ES cell medium.\nThe next morning, feed the cells with ES medium with 1 µg/ml puromycin and culture cells for 48 hr. Withdraw puromycin selection and continue to culture the cells for 5 days. When the colonies are large enough for picking, pick into a 96-well feeder plate (refer to section 4.2).\nWhen the picked cells have reached 80-90% confluency, split 1/6th of the plate into a DNA plate and 1/6th of the plate into a G418 plate, leaving 2/3rds of the cells in the original plate to be frozen (refer to section 2.2 for freezing).\nCulture the DNA plate in ES cell medium for later DNA isolation, and the G418 plate in 150 µg/ml G418 to test for the loss of neomycin resistance. Wells with no viable cells after 72-96 hr in culture containing G418 indicate successful remobilization of the gene-trapping PB transposon.\nThe corresponding wells in the ‘DNA’ plate will be screened by PCR to confirm the PB transposon has been removed. When the DNA plate is 90% confluent, isolate the genomic DNA in 96-well plate format 4 for PCR screening for the restoration of the wild-type sequence and the absence of neo-IRES as a means to confirm reversion.",
    "Thaw the matching wells from the Master plate to 24-well plate and expand to a T25 flask (all with feeders). Freeze four vials per T25 flask as back-up.\n7. Generation of Mouse Mutants\nRecover resistant ES cells from the master plates and use them for embryo injection to generate chimera. About 15–20 ES cells are injected into an individual C57BL/6 blastocyst. Transfer 15 blastocysts per mouse to the uterus of a pseudopregnant female (strain ICR). Mate the male chimera (indicated by the ES cells specific agouti coat color) recovered from the litter with several young virgin C57BL/6J females to test for germ-line transmission, and to build up a colony of mutant mice.\nIsolate and test tail skin fibroblasts from the F1 mutant mice and wild-type littermate for reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and resistance to paraquat9.\nSubscription Required.
