    "Animal experiments were performed after obtaining approval from the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee. Wistar rats were housed under a 12 hr dark to light cycle, constant room temperature (24 ± 2 °C) with food and water ad libitum (as per the CPCSEA guidelines).\n1) Pre-operative Care and Anesthesia\nKeep rat (approximately 200 g body weight) under antibiotic umbrella 24 hr before surgery by administering amoxicillin orally (dose: 500 mg/L of water).\nSterilize all surgical tools (such as scissors, forceps, clip applicator, suture needles, and needle holder) by autoclaving at 121 °C for 15 min.\nUse a heating pad to maintain the animal body temperature around 37 °C to avoid a rapid decrease in heart rate.\nTake care to avoid dehydration of the animal before and during surgery.\nAnesthetize the rat in an induction chamber with 3% isoflurane mixed with 0.5-1.0 L/min 100% oxygen; maintain anesthesia with 1.5% isoflurane.\nCheck the pedal reflex to confirm successful anesthesia.\n2) Preparation of the Surgical Site\nKeep the rat on top of a temperature controlled heating pad in the supine position.\nPosition a rubber band over the rat’s front teeth to keep the animal in position while maintaining anesthesia with a nose cone.\nRemove fur from the neckline and left chest region of the rat (preferably using an electric shaver).\nDisinfect surgical site with povidone-iodine solution and then with 70% ethyl alcohol.\nUse a sterile drape to expose only the surgical site during the operative procedure.\n\tNote: As an additional option for the animal care, 0.25% Bupivicaine ID (2.5 mg/kg) can be incorporated prior to incising at each incision site for local anesthesia/analgesia.\n3) Tracheal Intubation in Rat",
    "Make a small incision on the skin parallel to the trachea using a sterile surgical blade and carefully separate the underlying tissue in order to expose the trachea.\nApply a tie of 4-0 silk suture thread underneath the trachea and gently raise the tie upward.\nMake a half way incision between two cartilage rings and insert the tracheal cannula into the trachea of the rat.\nConnect the tracheal canula to a rodent ventilator for maintaining a respiratory rate of 50 breaths/min, tidal volume of 1.70 ml and inspiration time of 0.60 sec (for rat with 200 g body weight).\n4) Constriction of Ascending Aorta\nAfter sensing the position of the ribs with fingers, make a skin incision of about 2 cm on the left chest wall between the second and third ribs.\nSeparate the intercostal muscles layer by layer and make an incision about 1.5 cm long between the second and third ribs. (Care should be taken to avoid any injury to the lungs while making incision between the ribs)\nRetract the ribs and locate the ascending portion of the aorta.\nPlace a small sized titanium clip around the ascending aorta with the help of an applicator whereby constricting the aorta to 50–60% of the original diameter.\nFollowing the aortic constriction, approximate the second and third ribs with 3.0 prolene in an interrupted suture pattern. Simultaneously, pause the ventilator for about 2-4 sec in order to re-inflate the lungs.\nAppose the muscle layers with 3.0 prolene sutures and skin with 4.0 silk sutures in an interrupted suture pattern. Synthetic non absorbable sutures can be used instead of silk for suturing the skin.\nRemove tracheal cannula from the rat once spontaneous breathing is re-established.\nClose the tracheal opening with 3.0 prolene sutures and the skin layer with 4.0 silk sutures.",
    "Allow the animal to recover on the heating pad by gradually lowering the anesthesia and ventilator assisted respiration.\nIn age-matched sham control animals, perform tracheotomy and thoracotomy without constriction of ascending aorta.\n5) Post-operative Care\nDisinfect surgical area with povidone-iodine solution.\nAs post-operative analgesia, inject tramadol intra-peritoneally (10 mg/kg body weight/day) for 1 week.\nInject sterile normal saline intra-peritoneally if signs of dehydration appear after surgery (approximately 1 ml).\nAdminister amoxycillin orally, mixed with drinking water, for seven days (dose: 500 mg/L of water).\nRemove any remaining silk sutures from the skin post 10 days of surgery under inhalation anesthesia.\n6) Confirmation of Successful Constriction of Ascending Aorta\nPerform a trans-thoracic two dimensional Doppler- echocardiography to determine the intensity of the pressure overload produced by the constriction of ascending aorta.\nAnesthetize the rats one week post-surgery as described earlier (step 1.5)\nPlace the ultrasound transducer at the supra sternal position to record the pressure gradient across the constricted portion of ascending aorta.\n\tNote: Rats with a pressure gradient of about 60 mm of Hg at the aortic constricted site will develop severe cardiac hypertrophy by about 8-10 weeks post surgery.\nSubscription Required.
