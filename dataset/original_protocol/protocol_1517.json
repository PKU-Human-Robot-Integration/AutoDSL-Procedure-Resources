Typically, 3 × 10 cm plates are transfected for each transfer plasmid (e.g., YAP or TAZ), but this can be increased or decreased if more or less virus is required for a given construct. Alternatively, an individual 15 cm culture dish can be used and is roughly equivalent to 3 × 10 cm plates. Each 10 cm plate will yield ∼10 mL of viral supernatant. The Avanti J-30I high-performance centrifuge with JS-24.38 rotor described here has six buckets, each of which holds ∼30 mL of supernatant, so it is ideal to generate a total of 180 mL (18 plates) of viral supernatant in multiples of 30 mL for each virus. For example, in a single batch you can prepare:\n30 mL (3 plates) of the EFSp-GFP-Empty virus (control for YAP viruses)\n30 mL (3 plates) of the EFSp-GFP-YAP virus\n30 mL (3 plates) of the EFSp-GFP-YAPS94A virus\n30 mL (3 plates) of the EFSp-GFP-YAP5SA virus\n30 mL (3 plates) of the PGKp-GFP-Empty virus (control for TAZ)\n30 mL (3 plates) of the PGKp-GFP-TAZ virus\nCritical: For transfection and subsequent steps use freshly prepared culture media (within ∼2 weeks) that is not supplemented with antibiotics (Pen/Strep).\nDay 1: Seed packaging cells",
    "The day prior to transfection, seed ∼4 × 106 Lenti-X 293T cells per plate into 18 × 10 cm plates so that they will be 85%–95% confluent for transfection. Usually a 1:1 split of cells that are 85%–95% confluent is sufficient to achieve this.\nDay 2: Transfect packaging cells\nTransfect lentiviral packaging cells.\nAspirate media from Lenti-X 293T cells and replace with 8 mL of DMEM + 10% FBS (without antibiotics).\nPrepare transfection mixture using two sterile tubes per transfection (1.5 mL for 1 × 10 cm plate; 2 mL for 3 × 10 cm plates) according to Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1], consisting of:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1058_12.csv\nTube 1: plasmid DNA mixture\nTube 2: FuGENE HD transfection reagent mixture\nCritical: Minimize contact time of the FuGENE HD reagent with plastic ware (e.g., pipette tips and tubes) when in its undiluted form and do not use siliconized pipette tips or tubes. Add the FuGENE HD reagent directly to media without contacting the side of the tube. Once the FuGENE HD is diluted in media, contact with plastic surfaces is no longer a concern.\nIncubate mixtures ∼5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nAdd the entire volume of Tube 1 to Tube 2, pipette to mix and incubate 10–15 min at 20°C–25°C.\nAdd 500 μL of transfection mixture dropwise to each 10 cm plate of Lenti-X 293T cells and gently swirl. Incubate cells 12–18 h.\nDay 3: Replace media on packaging cells\nRemove media from cells and replace with 10 mL of DMEM + 10% FBS (without antibiotics). Incubate cells for 36–48 h prior to collecting virus-containing supernatant.\nCritical: The day following transfection, waste media contains infectious lentiviral particles. Waste should be bleached and disposed of appropriately according to institutional biosafety guidelines.",
    "Note: The day following transfection, GFP fluorescence should be clearly visible using a standard fluorescent microscope. If GFP fluorescence is not readily visible it indicates there is likely a problem with the plasmids or the transfection (Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).\nDay 5: Collect and concentrate lentivirus\nHarvest and concentrate lentivirus by high-speed centrifugation.\nInside a BSC, place an open-top thin wall ultra-clear round bottom 25 × 89 mm tube into each bucket of a JS-24.38 swinging bucket rotor.\nCollect lentivirus-containing media from Lenti-X 293T cells and combine up to 30 mL from each virus in a 50 mL conical tube. Centrifuge at 500 g for 5 min to remove large debris.\nFilter up to 30 mL of supernatant directly into the centrifuge bucket (containing a round bottom tube) using a 0.45 μm, low protein binding syringe filter attached to a 30 cc Luer-Lok syringe.\nCritical: This filtering step is essential to ensure that all of the Lenti-X packaging cells are removed from the viral preparation. It is also critical to use 0.45 μm, low protein binding filters as other materials or the use of 0.2 μm filters can result in reduced viral recovery.\nCarefully underlay 4 mL of 20% sucrose (in PBS) underneath the virus-containing media to create a sucrose cushion and tightly seal the rotor bucket.\nWeigh each bucket and adjust volumes to balance the buckets. We recommend keeping the buckets within 0.05 g of one another. DMEM + 10% FBS can be added to “underweight” buckets if needed; 100 μL is ≈ 0.1 g.\nTightly seal the rotor buckets and load the buckets onto the JS-24.38 rotor.\nTightly secure the rotor into the Avanti J-30I high-performance centrifuge. Centrifuge for ≥2 h at 4°C and max speed of 24,000 rpm (∼103,000 g). Set centrifuge to “SLOW” for ACCEL and DECEL.",
    "Once the centrifuge has stopped, immediately remove the buckets and transport to a biological safety cabinet. Unscrew the bucket lids and carefully remove the round bottom tubes with sterile forceps.\nDecant the supernatant and place the tube opening down on a sterile wipe to allow excess media to drain down. After ∼5 min, wipe any excess media from the edge of the tube and place the tube in a rack with the opening facing up.\nAdd 300 μL of sterile, cold PBS to the bottom of each tube. Adjust the pipette volume to ∼200 μL to avoid bubbles/frothing, and pipette up and down ∼2 min to resuspend the virus. Resuspending each tube in 300 μL gives a 100-fold concentration, although this volume can be adjusted if necessary. If multiple tubes were used for the same virus, these can now be combined.\nPrepare appropriately sized aliquots of the virus into sterile tubes and store at −80°C. We typically prepare aliquots ranging from 10–100 μL in 200 μL strip tubes, depending on the desired downstream experiments. Avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles as this will result in decreased titer. We have stored virus at −80°C for over 1 year without a noticeable drop in titer.\nVirus titration\nTiming: 5–6 days total, with hands-on time of ∼1 h for steps 5 and 6, and ∼6 h for step 7",
    "This section describes the steps to titrate the lentiviruses generated in previous steps. Here, we describe the procedure using the NCI-H209 SCLC cell line, but we use the same protocol for other YAPoff cell lines. Titrations do not need to be performed using the exact cell numbers described here, but we recommend keeping the ratio of cell number:media volume consistent with what will be used in subsequent experiments. We also suggest initially titrating viruses separately for each different cell line to be used, as we have observed differences in transduction efficiency of some lines.\nDays 1 and 2: Transduce NCI-H209 cells\nPrepare NCI-H209 cells for viral titration. Approximately 1.5 × 106 cells are required for each different virus plus 2.5 × 105 cells for a non-transduced (mock) control.\nTransfer “confluent” NCI-H209 cells (typically at a density of 0.5–1.0 × 106 cells/mL) to a conical tube and centrifuge at 300 g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend cells back to their original volume in culture media. Pipette the cells vigorously to ensure a single cell suspension.\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer (or other means) and dilute to a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/mL.\nAdd Polybrene to a final concentration of 4 μg/mL and transfer 500 μL of cell suspension (2.5 × 105 cells) to separate wells of a 24-well tissue culture plate. We recommend starting with six wells per virus, plus one additional well as a non-transduced control. This may be decreased as experience is gained with each vector system.\nTransduce H209 cells with lentivirus.\nThaw an aliquot of each virus stock and prepare a series of five, 3-fold serial dilutions of each virus into PBS (i.e., 1/3, 1/9, 1/27, 1/81 and 1/243).",
    "Add 2.5 μL from each dilution, as well as undiluted virus, to separate wells of the 24-well plate and incubate 14–18 h.\nCollect cells using a P1000 pipette. Pipette up and down 2–3 times to remove any cells loosely attached to the plate and transfer to a sterile microfuge tube.\nCentrifuge the cells 5min at 800 g, carefully remove the supernatant and resuspend in 750 μL of media. Transfer the cells to a new 24-well plate and incubate for 3–4 days.\nDay 5 or 6: Calculate viral titer\nCalculate viral titer\nAfter 3–4 days in culture (4–5 days after viral transduction), stain the cells for GFP expression using flow cytometry (see steps 10–11 below for a detailed protocol) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). GFP fluorescence can also be assessed using a fluorescent microscope, although accurately calculating the titer using this method is challenging due to the relatively weak GFP fluorescence and because NCI-H209 cells grow in large clusters.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1058-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Analysis of YAP and GFP by flow cytometry in NCI-H209 cells\n(A) GFP staining and flow cytometry analysis of non-transduced or NCI-H209 cells transduced with a titration curve of EFPs-GFP-Empty virus.\n(B) Flow cytometry analysis of GFP (left) and YAP (right) expression in non-transduced or NCI-H209 cells transduced with high titer EFPs-Empty-GFP or the indicated YAP viruses. MFI: mean fluorescence intensity; n/a: not applicable.\nViral titer (in infectious particles/μL) can be calculated using dilutions that produce <30% YAP/TAZ/GFP-positive cells. Use the following formula to calculate viral titer:\n- particles/μL = (F × N × D)/V\nwhere: F = the fraction of GFP-positive cellsN = number of cells initially transduced (e.g., 2.5 × 105) D = virus dilution factor that produced FV = volume of virus added (e.g., 2.5 μL)",
    "Note: Using these vectors we have found that YAP/TAZ/GFP expression plateaus 4–5 days after lentiviral transduction in most YAPoff cell line we have tested, so we typically examine expression at this point. For new cell lines we recommend following GFP expression over time using a fluorescent microscope to determine at which point GFP expression plateaus. Since YAP and TAZ suppress the growth of YAPoff cells we recommend assessing YAP/TAZ/GFP expression as soon as it plateaus when titrating the virus.\nHigh titer viral transduction for functional experiments\nTiming: 6 days total, with hands-on time of ∼2 h\nThis section describes the steps to transduce NCI-H209 cells for downstream biological assays and molecular analysis. The number of cells initially transduced may vary depending on the downstream assays to be performed and the specific cell line being used, but for most assays we transduce 1–10 × 106 cells. Here, we describe the protocol for transduction of 2 × 106 NCI-H209 cells, which will typically yield ∼5 × 106 cells five days later. Amounts can be scaled up or down to accommodate specific experiments. We transduce cells so that >90% are YAP/TAZ/GFP-positive, and have found that a MOI of ∼4 is sufficient to achieve this.\nPrepare NCI-H209 cells for transduction.\nHarvest and count cells as described in steps 5a–5c.\nAdd Polybrene to a final concentration of 4 μg/mL and transfer 4 mL of cell suspension (2 × 106 cells) to separate wells of a 6-well tissue culture plate. Prepare 1 well for each virus to be used plus one additional well for a non-transduced (mock) control.\nTransduce NCI-H209 with high titer lentiviruses.",
    "Thaw viral aliquots and add the appropriate volume of the Empty vector control or each of the individual YAP/TAZ viruses to the cells to achieve MOI of ∼4 (e.g., 8 × 106 viral particles) and gently swirl plate to mix. Incubate cells 14–18 h.\nCollect cells and transfer to a 15 mL conical tube. Centrifuge 300 g for 5 min, discard the supernatant and wash cells once in culture media.\nResuspend the cells in 6 mL of fresh culture media, transfer to a T25 tissue culture flask and incubate for 4 days. Monitor density of the cells and passage or supplement with additional media if necessary.\nAssessing YAP/TAZ/GFP expression by flow cytometry\nTiming: ∼6 h\nThis section describes the protocol for examining YAP/TAZ and GFP expression in transduced NCI-H209 cells using flow cytometry. This is a key step in accurately determining the proportion of cells transduced with the YAP/TAZ lentiviruses and in assessing the level of ectopic YAP/TAZ expression, although comparison between different cell lines can be misleading due to differences in instrument settings or background fluorescence of the different cell lines. We use a Beckman Coulter Gallios flow cytometer and Kaluza analysis software, although other flow cytometers capable of multicolor acquisition are also appropriate.\nCritical: Non-transduced NCI-H209 cells function as an important negative control for both GFP and YAP/TAZ expression since they are negative for both, and the Empty vector cells function as a single-stained (GFP+/YAP-) control. However, we recommend initially including additional unstained and single antibody-stained controls for each cell line being tested until experience is gained with the techniques (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]). Additional controls may also be necessary to perform compensation depending on the combination of fluorophores and instrument used.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1058_13.csv",
    "Note: We suggest including a YAP/TAZ-positive (YAPon) cell line as a control. We routinely use NCI-H661, A549 or NCI-H1650 non-SCLC cell lines, as they perform well using the same staining conditions, but other lines are also likely appropriate.\nYAP and GFP expression is usually very similar between the YAP, YAPS94A and YAP5SA samples, so the unstained and single stained controls for YAP should also be sufficient as controls for all three.\nHarvest and fix cells.\nCollect a control, YAPon, cell line (e.g., NCI-H661) by trypsination and transfer 0.5–1.0 × 106 cells to each of two different 1.5 mL microfuge tubes. One tube will be stained for YAP/TAZ and the other will be used as an unstained control.\nTransfer 0.5–1.0 × 106 transduced or control NCI-H209 cells to separate 1.5 mL microfuge tubes. Prepare separate tubes for each unstained or single stained control.\nCentrifuge cells at 800 g for 5 min in a table-top microfuge, discard the supernatant and wash the cells once with 1 mL of PBS.\nResuspend the cells in 250 μL of 4% PFA, and incubate 10–15 min at 20°C–25°C.\nCentrifuge cells at 800 g for 5 min at 4°C, discard the supernatant and wash the cells twice with 1 mL of PBS.\nPause point: After fixation and washes, cells can be stored in 500 μl of PBS at 4°C for up to 1 week. After storage, cells should be pelleted as before and old PBS removed prior to continuing to step 11.\nStain and analyze cells by flow cytometry.\nResuspend cells in 500 μL of perm/block buffer and transfer to a new 1.5mL microfuge tube. Incubate 30 min at 20°C–25°C. After ∼15min, invert the tubes 2–3 times to mix.",
    "Critical: After permeabilization, YAPoff cells do not pellet very well. Transferring the cells to a fresh tube in step 11a helps with this problem and reduces cell loss (Troubleshooting 2).\nCentrifuge cells at 800 g for 5 min at 4°C. Very carefully remove the supernatant using a P1000 pipette (Troubleshooting 2) and resuspend cells in 100–200 μL of primary antibody diluted in stain/wash buffer, or stain/wash buffer alone for unstained controls. The YAP or YAP/TAZ antibodies are diluted 1:100, whereas the GFP antibody is diluted 1:1000 (Troubleshooting 3).\nIncubate the cells for 1 h at 20°C–25°C. Every ∼15 min gently flick the tube to resuspend the cells.\nAdd 1 mL of stain/wash buffer to each sample, centrifuge as before, and carefully remove the supernatant. Wash the cells once more with 1 mL stain/wash buffer.\nResuspend the cells in 100–200 μL of secondary antibodies diluted 1:750 in stain/wash buffer. Unstained (no 1° Ab) and single stained controls should also be incubated with both secondary antibodies.\nIncubate the cells for 30 min at 20°C–25°C protected from light. After ∼15 min gently flick the tube to resuspend the cells.\nAdd 1 mL of stain/wash buffer to each sample, centrifuge as before, and carefully remove the supernatant. Wash the cells once more with 1 mL stain/wash buffer.\nResuspend cells in 300 μL of FACS buffer and filter through a cell strainer cap affixed to a FACS tube.\nPause point: Samples can be analyzed immediately or stored at 4°C for up to 24 hrs prior to analysis.\nAnalyze on Beckman Coulter Gallios flow cytometer using Kaluza analysis software and display data as a histogram (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nAssessing YAP/TAZ expression by quantitative western blotting\nTiming: 3 days",
    "This section describes the protocol for examining YAP/TAZ expression by quantitative western blotting using an Odyssey LI-COR Infrared imaging system. Gel electrophoresis and western blotting protocols have been described in detail elsewhere (Burckhardt et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Eslami and Lujan, 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Mahmood and Yang, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). We utilize pre-cast SDS-PAGE gradient gels (Bio-Rad) for electrophoresis and the Bio-Rad Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System for protein transfer, but alternative electrophoresis and transfer protocols should also acceptable.\nCritical: During cell lysis, ensure that lysis buffer is “ice cold,” maintain cells and protein lysates on ice and perform all centrifugation steps at 4°C.\nPrepare protein lysates.\nHarvest a portion of the transduced NCI-H209 cells as well as control YAPon cells (e.g., NCI-H661) similarly to steps 10a and 10b. We recommend starting with at least 2.5 × 106 cells.\nPellet cells by centrifugation, aspirate the supernatant, resuspend in 1 mL of PBS and transfer to a 1.5 mL microfuge tube.\nPrepare sufficient RIPA lysis buffer for all samples, plus some extra for step 13, by adding Protease/Phosphatase inhibitor cocktail and PMSF at a 1:100 dilution.\nAdd 100 μL of cold lysis buffer to each cell pellet and pipette to fully resuspend the pellet. For larger cell numbers the volume of lysis buffer may be increased.\nIncubate samples on ice for 5 min, then sonicate 2 × 3 s (with a 3 s pause between) using a Fisher Scientific Model 100 Sonic Dismembrator at a setting of “4” (power output ∼12 W).\nNote: If an appropriate sonicator is not available, sonication can be omitted without a major reduction in YAP signal, but we suggest increasing the incubation time to 10 min.\nCentrifuge samples in a table-top microfuge for 10 min at 4°C and ≥ 16,000 g.\nTransfer supernatants (protein lysate) to pre-chilled microfuge tubes.",
    "Pause point: Protein lysates can be stored long term at −80°C. Frozen lysates should be thawed on ice.\nDetermine protein concentration using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit II essentially as outlined in the manufacturer’s “microtiter plate protocol[href=https://www.bio-rad.com/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/LIT33.pdf]”.\nDilute 5 μL of lysate or lysis buffer alone 1:10 in dH2O.\nPrepare BSA standards as outline in the manufacturer’s protocol.\nDilute Dye Reagent Concentrate 1:4 in dH2O.\nAdd 10 μL of standard or sample to separate wells of a 96-well plate in at least duplicate (triplicate preferred).\nAdd 200 μL of diluted reagent and incubate 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nRead absorbance at 595 nm using a standard microplate reader.\nPrepare a standard curve plotting the absorbance vs. concentration of BSA standards. Determine the concentration of each sample by linear regression and multiply by 10 to account for the initial dilution in step 13a to obtain the protein concentration/μL of sample.\nDilute a portion of each sample using RIPA lysis buffer so that samples are of equal concentration. For example, if the most dilute sample is 2 μg/μL, dilute all other samples to 2 μg/μL by adding the appropriate amount of RIPA lysis buffer.\nGel electrophoresis and protein transfer.\nNote: The amounts/volumes suggested below are for a gel with “small” (15 lanes, 15 μl) wells. For larger wells (e.g., 10 lane, 30–50 μl), amounts can be increased accordingly.\nDilute protein lysates 1:1 with 2× Laemmli sample buffer (Laemmli, 1970[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]), then heat at 95°C for 5 min. Allow samples to cool to 20°C–25°C and briefly centrifuge.\nRemove pre-cast SDS-PAGE gel from packaging and assemble electrophoresis apparatus. Fill the chambers with Tris-Glycine-SDS running buffer, remove comb from the gel and flush wells with a P200 pipette set to ∼30 μL.",
    "Mix 3 μL of PageRuler Prestained protein marker with 7 μL of 1× Laemmli sample buffer (2× buffer diluted 1:1 with water) and load into lane 1 of the gel. Load 10–25 μg of protein lysate from each sample onto subsequent wells of the gel. For any empty wells, load 10 μL of 1× Laemmli sample buffer.\nAttach lid onto the electrophoresis unit and connect to power supply.\nRun at constant amperage of 30 mA/gel (for mini gels) or 70 mA/gel (for midi gels) with a maximum voltage of 200 V for ∼1 h until the blue dye front runs off the end of the gel.\nTurn power unit off, remove gel(s) and separate plates. Gently cut off the top of the gel where the wells were and carefully transfer the gel(s) to a reservoir containing 1× transfer buffer.\nBriefly equilibrate one nitrocellulose membrane per gel in transfer buffer and wet two transfer stacks per gel (all from the Bio-Rad Trans-Blot Turbo RTA Mini or Midi Transfer Kit).\nAssemble “transfer sandwich” (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) by placing one transfer stack in the bottom of the Trans-Blot Turbo cassette. Carefully place the nitrocellulose membrane on the transfer stack and align sides, followed by the gel and finally the last transfer stack on the top. Gently roll out to remove bubbles and carefully “dab” away excess buffer.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1058-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Turn on the Trans-Blot Turbo instrument using the switch located on the right hand side of the instrument near the back and slide the assembled cassette into either slot “A” or “B” of the instrument.\nUsing the control panel (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B), select:\n“LIST” using the bottom set of buttons on the display, then\n“BIO-RAD” using the buttons on the right hand side of the display, then\nEither “1 MINI GEL” or “2 MINI OR 1 MIDI GEL” as appropriate using the buttons on the right and side of the display, then\nScroll down using the buttons on the right hand side of the display until “MIXED MW” is highlighted and select “RUN” using the bottom buttons, then\nEither “A:RUN” or “B:RUN” using the bottom set of buttons on the display depending whether the cassette is located in slot A or B.\nWhen the transfer is complete, turn of the instrument, remove the cassette and then remove the cassette lid.\nDiscard the top transfer stack from the transfer sandwich and slowly begin to lift the gel from the side containing the protein marker, ensuring the marker has properly transferred to the membrane (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). Fully remove the gel and place the membrane in a container containing 20–30 mL of 5% milk (the bottom half of a P20/P200 tip box works well as a container for mini gels). Incubate 1–2 h at 20°C–25°C or 4°C for 14–24 h.\nQuantitative immunoblotting.\nBriefly rinse the membrane in 0.1% TBS-T and add enough YAP/TAZ primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, clone 63.7 diluted 1:500 in 1× TBS) to cover the membrane (∼10 mL for a mini gel). Incubate 1 h at 20°C–25°C then 4°C for 14–24 h.",
    "Remove primary antibody (this can be stored at 4°C and reused several times) and wash membrane 3 × 10 min with ∼15 mL of 0.1% TBS-T.\nAdd 10–15 mL of goat anti-mouse IRDye 680RD (diluted 1:5000 in 0.1% TBS-T), cover to protect from light and incubate 1 h at 20°C–25°C.\nWash membrane 3 × 10 min with ∼15 mL of 0.1% TBS-T, then image using a LI-COR Odyssey Infrared imaging system according to manufacturer’s protocols[href=https://www.licor.com/documents/k0b24yc5f7g9mapr61d2].\nUsing the LI-COR Odyssey software, quantify band intensities for YAP and/or TAZ.\nCritical: Ensure bands are not saturated after scanning (indicated by a blue color). If they are, re-scan at a lower “Intensity”.\nStrip membrane in 15–20 mL of TBS, pH 2.0 for 1–2 h at 20°C–25°C.\nWash membrane 3 × 10 min with ∼15 mL of 0.1% TBS-T and add primary anti-TUBULIN antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, clone DM1A diluted 1:2000 in TBS).\nIncubate at 4°C for 14–24 h, then repeat steps 15b–15e to image and quantify TUBULIN band intensities (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1058-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.
