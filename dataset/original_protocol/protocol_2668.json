    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMaking kidney organoids\nTiming: 26 days\nTiming: 8 days (for step 1a)\nTiming: 18 days (for step 2a)\niPSC-derived kidney organoids were generated according to the protocol described by Jansen et al.,5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] an adapted version from the originally developed protocol for the generation of kidney organoids from human pluripotent stem cells.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]\nAfter iPSC differentiation into either anterior intermediate mesoderm (AIM) and posterior intermediate mesoderm (PIM) from primitive streak, cells are cultured in a 3D air-liquid interface Transwell system to stimulate morphogenic cues essential for segmented patterning of nephrogenesis. On this system, AIM cells will lead differentiation towards the ureteric bud which will give rise to collecting duct structures, while PIM cells will differentiate into the metanephric mesenchyme and, subsequently, into the nephron. Mature kidney organoids will be re-plated in Seahorse Cell Culture microplates 1 h prior to analysis (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2323-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic of the iPSC-derived kidney organoid culture protocol\nAfter iPSC differentiation into either anterior intermediate mesoderm (AIM) (3d) or posterior intermediate mesoderm (PIM) (5d), cells are cultured in a 3D air-liquid interface Transwell system for an additional 18 days using a mixture of growth factors as indicated to stimulate morphogenic cues essential for nephrogenesis. BMP7, bone morphogenic protein 7; CHIR, CHIR 99021; FGF9, fibroblast growth factor 9; hEGF, human epidermal growth factor; SDF1β, Stromal cell-derived factor-1 β.\niPSC differentiation into the ureteric bud and metanephric mesenchyme lineages:\nWhen iPSC colonies reach 60%–80% confluency in one well of a 6-well plate, aspirate the culture medium, rinse the cells with 2 mL per well of prewarmed (18°C–24°C) PBS three times and incubate the cells with 1 mL per well of prewarmed TrypLE Select solution for 2 min at 37°C.",
    "Critical: Check cell detachment efficiency by gently resuspending the cells with some of the TrypLE Select included in each well by using a P1000 pipette and monitor dissociation under a bright-field microscope to ensure that cells are dissociated into single cells. If cells do not detach into single cells, extend TrypLE incubation time at 37°C for an additional 30 s. To avoid cell damage, a longer incubation time than 3 min is not recommended.\nAdd 3 mL “iPSC maintenance medium” to each well.\nNote: Do not pipette the cell suspension up and down more than ten times to avoid mechanical stress on the cells.\nTransfer the single-cell suspension to a 15-mL tube using a P1000 pipette.\nAdd 2 mL of “iPSC maintenance medium” to each well to collect any leftover cells, transfer them to the same 15-mL tube and centrifuge the cell suspension at 300 rcf for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 2.5 mL of “iPSC maintenance medium” containing 1:100 revitacell.\nDetermine the cell density using a hemocytometer.\nFor iPSC134, seed 220,000 cells in 2.5 mL of “iPSC maintenance medium” containing 1:100 revitacell on Geltrex-coated 6-well plates.\nNote: The cell number for the seeding needs to be established for each individual cell line which will be in the range of 170,000–250,000 cells/well to reach a 100% cell confluency at day 7. As reference, by seeding a complete 6-well plate, approximately 180 kidney organoids will be obtained.\nAfter 24 h (day 0), initiate iPSC differentiation by replacing the culture medium with 6 mL “iPSC differentiation medium 1”.\nNote: Revise under the microscope that cells are growing as single cells [troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]].",
    "At day 3, replace culture medium by 2.5 mL of “iPSC differentiation medium 2” in 1/3 of wells (3d cells), while in the rest replace it by 2.5 mL “iPSC differentiation medium 1” (5d cells).\nNote: “3d cells” are referred to those treated with Essential 6™ medium supplemented with FGF9 and heparin in this step which induce iPSC differentiation into AIM, while “5d cells” to those treated with Essential 6™ medium containing CHIR 99021 which initiates differentiation to PIM. Cell medium does not need to be refreshed between day 0 and day 3.\nAt day 4, refresh the culture medium using 2.5 mL of the same type of medium than in the previous step in each well.\nAt day 5, 6 and 7 replace culture medium by 2.5 mL of “iPSC differentiation medium 2” in all the wells.\nCritical: Cell medium changing must be carried out very gently. Release cell culture medium drop by drop to avoid mechanical stress to the cells, which might lead to uncontrolled iPSC differentiation and cell detachment.\nNote: Revise under the microscope that cells are growing as a monolayer and have reached 100% confluency. Importantly, due to the iPSC differentiation media not containing antibiotics, special attention must be paid on the sterile environment and signs of contamination [troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]].\nCell 3D self-organization towards kidney organoids:\nCarefully, rinse the cells with 2 mL per well of prewarmed PBS three times.\nIncubate the cells with 1 mL per well of prewarmed Trypsin-EDTA (0.05%) for 2 min at 37°C.\nAdd 3 mL DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS to each well.\nNote: Do not pipette the cell suspension up and down to avoid mechanical stress on the cells.\nTransfer the 3d and 5d single-cell suspensions separately into different 50-mL tubes using a P1000 pipette.",
    "Fill each 50-mL centrifuge tube to 25 mL with DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS.\nDetermine cell density of 3d and 5d live cells using a hemocytometer.\nMix the 5d:3d suspensions based on their cell numbers in a 2:1 ratio and centrifuge the mixed 3d:5d cell suspension at 300 rcf for 5 min.\nResuspend the cell suspension in Essential 6™ medium without cytokines in such a way that 200 μL cell suspension contain 200,000 cells.\nMake as many 200 μL aliquots of the previous cell suspension in 1.5 mL tubes as kidney organoids are needed.\nCentrifuge each tube 3 times at 300 rcf for 3 min at 18°C–24°C changing position by 180° per cycle to generate roundish cell aggregates.\nNote: Centrifuging for 9 min only in one direction will lead to an elongated cell pellet which is not compact enough to be transferred onto the Transwell filter in one piece.\nPick up pellets using 200 μL wide-bore tips and plate them on Transwell filters (4 pellets per filter) (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F–1I).\nCritical: To avoid damage of the aggregates (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]J), use a P20 pipette set to 18 μL with 200 μL wide-bore tips to transfer aggregates. Gentle operation is required for this transfer process.\nAdd 1.2 mL Essential 6™ medium supplemented with 5 μM CHIR 99021 into the bottom part of each Transwell well to stimulate self-organizing nephrogenesis.\nAfter 1 h, replace culture medium below the filter by “iPSC differentiation medium 2”.\nCritical: Do not add cell culture medium on top of the filter. The air/liquid interface is crucial for the cells to stick together and develop into kidney organoids.\nRefresh previous culture medium every two days.\nOn day 7 + 5, replace culture medium by kidney organoid medium (Essential 6™ medium supplemented with hEGF, BMP7, SDF1β, vasopressin and aldosterone).",
    "Until d7+18, refresh previous culture medium every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.\nCritical: Avoid culture medium bubble formation below cell aggregates in the Transwell plates to ensure appropriate medium supply to kidney organoids (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).\nNote: The quality of kidney organoid formation can be evaluated by the identification of tubular structures under a bright field microscope. Further, it can be addressed by the analysis of specific marker genes at different stages of iPSC differentiation by qPCR or immunofluorescence, which is recommended when performing this protocol for the first times. Thus, LIM Homeobox 1 (LHX1), Empty Spiracles Homeobox 2 (EMX2) and GATA Binding Protein 3 (GATA3) are AIM markers, while Glial Cell Derived Neurotrophic Factor (GDNF), SIX Homeobox 2 (SIX2) and Homeobox A11 (HOXA11) are PIM markers, which can be studied at step 1_k. Mature kidney organoids show the presence of podocytes (Nephrin, NPHS1), proximal tubules (lotus tetragonolobus lectin, LTL), distal-like (E-cadherin, ECAD) and collecting duct-like (ECAD and binding protein 3 (GATA3)) cells [troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]].4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5],10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10],11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]\nNote: If treatments are needed to induce kidney organoid injury, they should be applied after completion of morphogenesis both on top and below the Transwell filter with 800 μL and 1.2 mL of E6 medium, respectively, to gain maximum exposure surface area. Treatments have to be maintained after re-plating into Seahorse microplates. Here, we show an example of kidney organoids treated with 2 ng/mL aristolochic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, A5512) for 72 h.\nSensor cartridge hydration\nTiming: 12 h\nEach probe tip of the sensor cartridge is spotted with a solid-state sensor material that detects changes in both pH and O2 concentration. For correct functioning, they have to be hydrated in XF Calibrant for 12 h.",
    "Lift the sensor cartridge from the utility plate and fill each well of the utility plate with 200 μL of XF Calibrant (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2323-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Seahorse sensor cartridge hydration and injection port loading\nSeahorse sensor cartridge on top of a utility plate with injection ports A–D, with details of the O2- and pH-sensitive probe tips of a Seahorse sensor cartridge and substrate/inhibitor stock solutions loading in the injection ports of the Seahorse sensor cartridge.\nOptional: Sterile water can be used instead of XF Calibrant.\nPlace the sensor cartridge back on the utility plate, submerging the sensors in the XF Calibrant.\nPlace the assembled sensor cartridge and utility plate in a non-CO2 37°C incubator for 12 h.\nNote: To prevent evaporation of the XF Calibrant during this incubation time, seal the lid to the utility plate with Parafilm® tape or use a humidified incubator. Further incubation time does not affect negatively to the correct functioning of this device.\nRe-plate organoids for Seahorse analysis\nTiming: 1 h\nEach kidney organoid must be plated in one well of a Seahorse XF96 cell culture microplate. Below, we describe step-by-step how to accurately re-plate individual organoids to guarantee reliable measurements.\nCritical: Before starting, prepare 20 mL of the corresponding Seahorse assay medium as indicated in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section and warm it to 37°C before using it.\nCarefully wash organoids twice with 500 μL of the corresponding assay medium.\nRemove the assay medium from the upper compartment of the wells of the Transwell plate. Place the insert upside-down on a flat surface and individualize every kidney organoid by cutting the porous membrane closely around each one by using a scalpel blade (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C and 4D).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2323-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Scale bar, 250 μm.\n(C) Schematic depicting the strategy individualize every kidney organoid by cutting the porous membrane closely around each one by using a scalpel blade.\n(D) Individualized kidney organoid by cutting the Transwell porous membrane.\n(E) Re-plated kidney organoids on a Seahorse XF96 cell culture microplate.\n(F) Empty well of a Seahorse XF96 cell culture microplate showing its three nodes at the bottom.\n(G) Correct Geltrex™ immobilized kidney organoid in the middle of a well of a Seahorse microplate.\n(H) Disrupted Geltrex™ immobilized kidney organoid in the middle of a well of a Seahorse microplate.\nNote: To minimize potential organoid drying, isolate all the kidney organoids within a well and proceed to next step.\nPlate each kidney organoid in one well of a Seahorse XF96 cell culture microplate.\nAdd 3 μL Geltrex™ (1:2 dissolved in DMEM/F-12) in the middle of the bottom of each well of a Seahorse XF96 cell culture microplate (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E and 4G).\nImmediately, place the organoid, including the Transwell membrane, in the middle of the well and in between the three nodes to adhere the organoid to the bottom of the plate (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F).\nNote: Do not place kidney organoids in the A1, A12, H1 and H12 wells to keep them as background wells.",
    "Critical: Once thawed, keep Geltrex™ on ice and use ice-cold tips and tubes while manipulating to avoid early polymerization. For the same purpose, do not add Geltrex until you have isolated the organoid and it is ready to be placed into the well. Kidney organoids should not be embedded into the Geltrex™ matrix whose only function here is to get the membrane attached to immobilize the organoid on the bottom of the well. Wait 1 min before proceeding with the addition of the assay medium to allow Geltrex™ matrix polymerization [troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]].\nAdd 180 μL of the corresponding assay medium into each well of the Seahorse XF96 cell culture microplate containing kidney organoids and in background wells [troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]].\nOptional: When analyzing the effect of drugs/treatment on bioenergetics, it might be necessary to maintain the treatment during the Seahorse assay. This needs to be decided based on the mechanism of action of the drug and the research purpose.\nPlace organoids in an incubator without CO2 control at 37°C for 45 min.\nNote: For an accurate assessment of the bioenergetic parameters, we recommend to have at least 5 wells per experimental condition.\nXF mitochondrial stress test or glycolysis stress test\nTiming: 3 h\nAgilent has developed several assays to analyze different bioenergetic parameters. We describe an optimized assay medium composition, substrate and inhibitor concentrations and measurement settings for the XF96 Analyzer to carry out mitochondrial and glycolysis stress tests in single kidney organoids.\nDuring the incubation time of organoids in assay medium, prepare the stocks of substrate and inhibitor solutions as indicated in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section.\nSubstrate and inhibitor stock solutions should be loaded in the injection ports of the sensor cartridge. The device will inject the drugs in the order of port A to port D.",
    "For mitochondrial stress test:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2323_9.csv\nFor glycolysis stress test:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2323_10.csv\nCritical: Do NOT insert pipet tips fully into the injection ports to avoid the damage of probe sensors. A port guide provided with each XF96 Sensor Cartridge can be used to assist loading in the ports. If so, place the pipette tips vertically into the port loading guide holes. Otherwise, dispense the load allowing the pipette tips to touch port rims in the inside top part. The use of extended length pipette tips is also recommended.\nUpon completion of injection port loading, place the sensor cartridge holder in the utility plate back into the incubator.\nOptional: To analyze the metabolic response to an acute treatment, drugs can be injected during the mitochondrial or glycolysis stress test via the injection port A. In that case, move the injections corresponding to the mitochondrial or glycolysis stress test to port B, C and D, respectively and adjust concentrations of the inhibitors in injection ports according to the change in the volume resulting from adding preceding injection in port A.\nPrepare the settings of the XF Analyzer.\nOpen the Wave software.\nOpen a mitochondrial or glycolysis stress test template and fill in the assay details. A detailed explanation about Wave software can be found in: https://www.agilent.com/en/product/cell-analysis/how-to-run-an-assay[href=https://www.agilent.com/en/product/cell-analysis/how-to-run-an-assay].\nAdjust the XF96 analysis settings in the “Instrument Protocol” section.\nFor mitochondrial stress test:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2323_11.csv\nFor glycolysis stress test:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2323_12.csv\nSave your template.\nRun the mitochondrial or glycolysis stress test [troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.11]].\nClick on the “Run” button, the plate platform will be accessible and the Wave software will ask to insert the sensor cartridge in the XF96 Analyzer.\nPlace the sensor cartridge holder in the utility plate in the XF96 Analyzer.\nNote: The calibration step will take approximately 20 min.",
    "After calibration, replace the utility plate by the Seahorse Cell Culture microplate containing the organoids and the XF96 analysis will automatically begin.\nCritical: Proceed immediately to organoid cell number determination after the experiment has finished.\nNote: The analysis step will take approximately 2 h.\nOrganoid cell number determination\nTiming: 30 min (for step 16)\nDue to cell number variability among kidney organoids, determination of bioenergetic parameters requires normalization. Below we describe how to individually disaggregate kidney organoids and count their total cell number.\nCarefully remove the assay medium from each well by using a pipette.\nNote: Avoid aspiration to remove assay medium to minimize the risk of kidney organoid disruption or detachment.\nAdd 100 μL Accutase per well and incubate the plate at 37°C for 10 min and disaggregate the kidney organoid by pipetting it up and down.\nNote: In case of incomplete organoid disaggregation, prolong the incubation time (max. up to 20 min) at 37°C.\nAdd 100 μL DMEM/F12 medium containing 10% (v/v) FCS to each well to inactivate Accutase and mix by pipetting.\nCount the number of cells using a hemocytometer. Calculate the number of cells in the total volume in each well which corresponds to the total number of cells in the respective kidney organoid.\nNote: Alternatively, an automatic cell counter can be used to determine total cell number per organoid. Nuclear DNA content is also a reliable normalization method. Due to the presence of Geltrex™ matrix, normalization by protein content is not adequate. Organoid cell number should be included in the Seahorse Wave Desktop software for data normalization (for details see quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis] section)."
