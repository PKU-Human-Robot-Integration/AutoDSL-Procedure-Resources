    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIsolation and fixation of nuclei from the human or mouse brain\nTiming: 2 h\nIn this step, cell nuclei are isolated from the human or mouse brain through mechanical homogenization (Dounce homogenizer) in the presence of a detergent (0.1% Triton X-100), and preserved with a fixative (2% PFA).\nIsolation of nuclei was adapted from (Krishnaswami et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Lacar et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) with minor modifications. In particular, Tris buffer was replaced with an equal molarity of HEPES buffer to avoid interference with PFA fixation.\nNote that nuclei isolation may alter native 3D genome structure, because the cytoskeleton and gene transcription may be disrupted. Nuclei should be isolated as fast as possible and kept at 4°C until fixation to minimize changes to the 3D genome. We have not tested fixation before nuclei isolation, because homogenization is generally more challenging for fixed tissues.\nNuclei isolation\nOptional: If using cells rather than nuclei, skip this section and proceed directly to Fixation (Step 14).\nChill a 2 mL Dounce homogenizer (Sigma D8938) on ice for up to 200 mg of tissue. For larger tissues, use a homogenizer of a larger size (D9063 for 7 mL, D9938 for 15 mL, D9188 for 40 mL, D0189 for 100 mL) and scale up the reaction accordingly.\nFreshly prepare 1 mM DTT. Each reaction consumes 6 μL. The following recipe (1 mL) is sufficient for 150 reactions:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_744_5.csv\nVortex to mix.\nFreshly prepare Nuclei Isolation Buffer without Triton: The following recipe (6 mL) is for 1 reaction:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_744_6.csv\nVortex to mix. Chill on ice.\nFreshly prepare Nuclei Isolation Buffer with Triton: The following recipe (2 mL) is for 1 reaction:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_744_7.csv\nVortex to mix. Chill on ice.\nAdd 2 mL ice-cold Nuclei Isolation Buffer with Triton to the homogenizer.",
    "Add up to 200 mg tissue to the homogenizer.\nDounce the tissue with 5 strokes of the loose pestle (A), and 15 strokes of the tight pestle (B).\nTransfer the homogenate to a conical tube.\nCentrifuge at 100 g for 8 min at 4°C.\nCarefully remove supernatant without disrupting the soft pellet. Resuspend in 2 mL Nuclei Isolation Buffer without Triton.\nCentrifuge at 100 g for 8 min at 4°C.\nCarefully remove supernatant without disrupting the soft pellet. Resuspend in 2 mL Nuclei Isolation Buffer without Triton.\nFilter by a 40-um cell strainer (Corning 352340) or other sizes (352235 for 35 μm, 352360 for 100 μm).\nNote: The nuclei suspension may be cloudy because of debris (e.g., myelin). Debris does not affect downstream procedures, and will be partially solubilized during SDS treatment (Step 26 and Step 27) at the Chromatin Conformation Capture step.\nFixation\nOptional: If using cells rather than nuclei, start from here.\nFreshly prepare 1% BSA in PBS: Dissolve 0.1 g BSA (Gemini 700-106P) in 10 mL PBS (ThermoFisher 10010023). Each reaction consumes 1.2 mL. Chill on ice.\nAdd 133.3 μL 32% PFA (EMS 15714; store at 4°C for up to a month after opening) to each 2 mL cells or nuclei (final concentration: 2%).\nCritical: PFA is hazardous. Perform the above and following steps (until Step 19: resuspension of the pellet in 1% BSA in PBS) in a fume hood and properly dispose of waste.\nNote: We have not tested other types of formaldehyde (e.g., methanol-containing), other fixatives, or unfixed cells or nuclei.\nRotate at 18°C–27°C for 10 min.\nAdd 200 μL ice-cold 1% BSA in PBS. Invert to mix.",
    "Note: BSA, rather than the more widely used glycine, is used to react with excess PFA because in our hands, reaction between glycine and PFA acidifies the solution (yellow when phenol red is present, indicating pH < 6) and would dissolve all cells or nuclei if left for too long (> 1 hour on ice).\nNote: The above step is not aimed to fully quench PFA. Addition of BSA greatly reduces loss of cells or nuclei by preventing cells or nuclei from sticking to the side of the tube, and from aggregating when spun down and resuspended in 1% BSA in PBS.\nCentrifuge at 1000 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nOptional: If using cells rather than nuclei, centrifuge at 600 g instead.\nRemove supernatant. Resuspend in 1 mL ice-cold 1% BSA in PBS.\nNote: The above step fully quenches PFA, and was adapted from Thomsen et al. (2016)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14].\nMeasure cell or nuclei density with a disposable hemocytometer (INCYTO DHC-N01; manufacturer’s protocol: http://www.incyto.com/shop/item.php?it_id=1482380591[href=http://www.incyto.com/shop/item.php?it_id=1482380591]) and optionally Trypan Blue (ThermoFisher 15250061) if debris is abundant.\nAliquot up to 500 k–1 m cells or nuclei per tube. There is no lower bound in principle; see before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] for details. Each adult mouse brain approximately corresponds to 8 tubes for the cortex and 2 tubes for the hippocampus (2 sides combined). Too many cells (> a few million) may lead to insufficient digestion/ligation and aggregation of cells or nuclei.\nCentrifuge at 1000 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nOptional: If using cells rather than nuclei, centrifuge at 600 g instead.\nRemove supernatant. Store indefinitely at −80°C.\nNote: The pellet may be large because of debris. Debris does not affect downstream procedures.\nPause Point: Fixed cells or nuclei can be stored indefinitely at −80°C.\nChromatin conformation capture (3C/Hi-C)",
    "Timing: 2 days (or shorter, if using commercially available kits)\nIn this step, after detergent (0.5% SDS) treatment, chromatin in fixed nuclei is digested with restriction enzyme(s) (e.g., MboI, DpnII, and/or NlaIII), and re-ligated with a DNA ligase to form artificial linkages (i.e., “chromatin contacts”) between genomic loci that are far away along the linear sequence but nearby in the 3D space. Success of digestion and ligation is assessed by extracting DNA from a small portion (5%) of the reaction, and measuring its length distribution.\nThis step was adapted from (Nagano et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Rao et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]), and can be replaced with other 3C/Hi-C protocol or commercially available 3C/Hi-C kits such as the Arima-SC kit.\nDigestion\nThaw 500 k–1 m fixed cells or nuclei on ice.\nOptional: If starting from fixed cells rather than nuclei, perform the following additional steps:\nPrepare Hi-C Lysis Buffer. Each reaction consumes 1 mL:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_744_8.csv\nVortex to mix. Chill on ice.\nFreshly prepare Hi-C Lysis Buffer with Inhibitor. Each reaction consumes 600 μL:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_744_9.csv\nVortex to mix. Chill on ice.\nResuspend cells in 600 μL ice-cold Hi-C Lysis Buffer with Inhibitor.\nIncubate on ice for 15 min, occasionally inverting the tube.\nCentrifuge at 2500 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant. Resuspend in 500 μL ice-cold Hi-C Lysis Buffer.\nCentrifuge at 2500 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nPrepare 0.5% SDS. Each reaction consumes 50 μL. The following recipe (100 μL) is sufficient for 1 reaction:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_744_10.csv\nVortex to mix.\nResuspend cells or nuclei in 50 μL 0.5% SDS.\nNote: SDS treatment is necessary to obtain a large number of contacts per cell. Without SDS treatment, the number of contacts per cell may decrease by 2 orders of magnitudes.\nIncubate at 62°C for 10 min.",
    "Add 145 μL water and 25 μL 10% Triton X-100 (Sigma 93443) (final concentration: 1.14%). Pipette to mix.\nRotate at 37°C for 15 min.\nAdd restriction enzyme(s) and buffer: 25 μL 10 X NEBuffer 2 (NEB B7002S) and 20 μL 25 U/μL MboI (NEB R0147M). Alternatives include: 25 μL 10 X CutSmart Buffer and 20 μL 10 U/μL NlaIII (NEB R0125L), 25 μL 10 X NEBuffer DpnII and 10 μL 50 U/μL DpnII (NEB R0543M), or a combination of multiple enzymes.\nRotate at 37°C for 1–24 h.\nTake 5% (13 μL out of the total 265 μL) and store at 4°C as a Digestion Control.\nLigation\nCentrifuge at 1000 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nFreshly prepare Ligation Buffer. Each reaction consumes 2 tubes. The following recipe (1 tube) is sufficient for 0.5 reactions:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_744_11.csv\nVortex to mix.\nRemove supernatant leaving ∼50 μL. Resuspend in 1 tube of Ligation Buffer.\nCentrifuge at 1000 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant leaving ∼50 μL. Resuspend in 1 tube of Ligation Buffer.\nAdd 10 μL 1 U/μL T4 DNA ligase (ThermoFisher 15224-025). Invert to mix.\nIncubate at 16°C for 4 h, occasionally inverting to tube.\nTake 5% (50 μL out of the total 1 mL) and store at 4°C as a Ligation Control.\nCentrifuge at 1000 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant. Store indefinitely at −80°C.\nPause Point: Ligated cells or nuclei, as well as the Digestion Control and Ligation Control, can be stored indefinitely at −80°C.\nQuality control\nCentrifuge the Digestion Control and Ligation Control at 1000 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant from each control. Add 95 μL PBS (ThermoFisher 10010023) and 5 μL 0.8 U/μL Proteinase K (NEB P8107S) (final concentration: 0.04 U/μL) per control. Vortex to mix.",
    "Lyse the controls by running the following PCR program:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_744_12.csv\nPurify the controls with PCR purification columns (Zymo D4013; manufacturer’s protocol: https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d4003t_d4003_d4004_d4013_d4014_dna_clean_concentrator_-5.pdf[href=https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d4003t_d4003_d4004_d4013_d4014_dna_clean_concentrator_-5.pdf]) using a 1:5 ratio between lysate and DNA Binding Buffer. Elute into 6 μL TE (ThermoFisher AM9849) per control.\nNote: For each control (100 μL), add 500 μL DNA Binding Buffer. 6 μL is the minimum elution volume of the column.\nPause Point: Purified controls can be stored indefinitely at −20°C.\nMeasure DNA concentration with a Qubit 1× dsDNA HS Assay (ThermoFisher Q33230; manufacturer’s protocol: https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/MAN0017455_Qubit_1X_dsDNA_HS_Assay_Kit_UG.pdf[href=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/MAN0017455_Qubit_1X_dsDNA_HS_Assay_Kit_UG.pdf]).

Both were run on a Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA kit.\nWhole-genome amplification (WGA) by tagmentation\nTiming: 1 day\nIn this step, single cell or nuclei are sorted into multi-well plates, lysed, and amplified with transposition (Tn5) and PCR.\nThe procedure below describes amplification with our implementation of the Illumina Nextera chemistry. If higher sensitivity is required—for example, when the number of contacts obtained is insufficient for distinguishing desired cell types or for 3D modeling with desired spatial resolution, please follow the procedure of our multiplex end-tagging amplification (META) method (Tan et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). META can detect 2 times as many contacts as Nextera, but involves custom Tn5 transposomes and 2 additional PCR steps.\nFor first-time users, we recommend starting with 1 96-well plate. Experienced users may amplify 4–8 plates at a time, depending on the number of available PCR machines.",
    "Nextera Index Primers listed in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] allow the pooling of up to 384 cells or nuclei to be sequenced on the same lane. Other index designs may allow more cells or nuclei to be pooled (e.g., 10-bp dual Nextera indices from IDT allows 3,840).\nFlow sorting and lysis\nThaw a tube of ligated cells or nuclei on ice.\nFreshly prepare 300 μM DAPI. Each reaction consumes 1 μL. The following recipe is sufficient for 100 reactions:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_744_13.csv\nVortex to mix.\nResuspend cells or nuclei in 1 mL PBS (ThermoFisher 10010023).

The following recipe (1 mL) is sufficient for 4 96-well plates:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_744_14.csv\nVortex to mix. Aliquot to 80 μL in 12-strip tubes.\nNote: Addition of Carrier ssDNA reduces loss of input DNA materials by preventing genomic DNA from sticking to the side of the tube, especially in PCR tubes that are not low-retention.\nNote: Volume (0.25 μL) of 60 mg/mL Qiagen Protease does not need to be exact. If desired, however, pipetting accuracy can be increased by freshly diluting 60 mg/mL Qiagen Protease prior to addition (e.g., 1:100 dilution followed by the addition of 25 μL instead of 0.25 μL).\nOptional: Before the addition of 60 mg/mL Qiagen Protease, Dip-C Lysis Buffer can be stored indefinitely at −20°C.\nAdd 2 μL Dip-C Lysis Buffer per well to a DNA low-bind 96-well plate (semi-skirted: Eppendorf 0030129504; or skirted: Eppendorf 0030129512, depending on the FACS and PCR machines).\nNote: To maximize speed, use a 12-channel pipette to add solution to each well in the above and all subsequent steps.",

Both were run on a BD FACSAria flow sorter. The 2 gating strategies arose from personal preferences of different flow cytometer operators, and do not affect the results. Note that we primarily study cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle; the corresponding gate (e.g., “G1” in (B)) should be adjusted when studying other phases of the cell cycle.\nCritical: Once cells or nuclei are sorted into Dip-C Lysis Buffer, avoid cross contamination of liquid between wells.\nCentrifuge at 1000 g for 1 min.\nPause Point: Sorted cells or nuclei in Dip-C Lysis Buffer can be stored on ice for a few hours before lysis.\nLyse the cells by running the following PCR program:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_744_15.csv\nStore at −80°C.\nPause Point: Lysed cells or nuclei can be stored for a few months at −80°C.\nNote: The film (Bio-Rad MSB1001) may peel over time at −80°C.

    "Add 8 μL Transposition Mix per well (total volume: 10 μL), avoiding touching the liquid (i.e., pipette onto the side, rather than the bottom, of the well). Vortex and spin down.\nNote: Before PCR amplification, we typically avoid touching the liquid with pipette tips to minimize loss of input DNA materials. In particular, if pipette tips touch the liquid, genomic DNA may stick to the tips and get lost when tips are withdrawn from the liquid. However, the efficacy of this precaution has not been tested systematically; touching the liquid may be acceptable if the resulting data is satisfactory.\nTranspose the genome by running the following PCR program:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_744_18.csv\nStopping\nFreshly prepare Stop Mix.
