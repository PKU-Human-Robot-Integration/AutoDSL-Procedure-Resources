    "The Institutional Review Board at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill approved this research.\n1. Personnel and Space Requirements\nPerform testing in a sound-isolating room. Configure the room with a table and chairs, as shown in Figure 1.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54788/54788fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Test environment. The assistant and the listener are seated at a table inside the sound booth. The child's parent may elect to sit inside or outside the booth. The observer sits outside the booth, positioned in front of the window for good visibility of the assistant and the child. The computer screen and keyboard controlling the run-time computer are accessible to the observer, allowing him/her to initiate trials and enter responses. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=http://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54788/54788fig1large.jpg]\nUse two experimenters to test toddlers and preschoolers; an \"assistant\" who sits inside the booth with the child and an \"observer\" who is in the adjacent control room.\n\tNOTE: The role of the assistant inside the booth is to: (1) train the child to perform a simple play-based motor response (e.g., stacking blocks) whenever the target signal is heard; (2) provide reinstruction whenever necessary; (3) socially engage the child throughout the testing session; (4) change the game the child is playing based on the child's level of interest; and (5)Â provide social reinforcement (e.g., clapping or cheering) following trials in which the child performs the targeted motor response.",
    "NOTE: The role of the observer seated outside of the booth is to: (1) observe the child and assistant inside the booth through a window; (2) initiate test trials when the child is quiet and in a \"ready\" position; and (3) indicate whether the child heard the sound in the 1st or 2nd interval following each test trial by clicking on the corresponding response button in the computer software user interface. This decision is based solely on the child's response.\n\tNOTE: The experience level of the experimenters will affect the yield rate and data obtained. In this experiment, all observers and assistants had at least two years of experience testing toddlers and preschoolers in the audiology clinic and/or research laboratory.\nLocate the computer and hardware in the control room. Position the computer monitor so the observer can view the monitor as well as the child and the assistant inside the booth.\nEquip the testing space with a two-way communication system between the observer and the assistant.\n\tNOTE: This system allows the two testers to work together to ensure trials are initiated when the child is alert and oriented to the task.\n2. Hardware and Software Configuration\nIn this example, custom software controls a real-time processor, which routes the sound to an insert earphone. Alternatively, a soundcard system with precise control of stimulus timing can be used.\nSelect a target signal. In this example, the signal is a 500 msec, 1,000 Hz warble tone.\nPresent the stimuli through an earphone that is appropriately calibrated to ensure the sound levels presented to the listener are accurate and safe.\nProgram the custom software to control the timing of the two observation intervals for each trial.",
    "NOTE: In this example, each observation interval is 1,065 msec in duration, and intervals are separated by a 300 msec inter-stimulus interval. Thus, the total duration of each trial is 2,430 msec.\nCollect pilot data to help select appropriate durations for the signal, the observation intervals and inter-stimulus interval. Optimal durations may vary depending on the stimulus and the population and/or age of children being tested.\nProgram the software to provide an audio and visual prompt to mark the two intervals. In this example, an audio prompt is a voice recording of a female talker saying \"one\" and \"two.\" Both the observer and the assistant hear the audio prompt. The visual prompt appears as a flashing black circle on the monitor screen. Only the observer sees the visual display.\n\tNOTE: The observer uses these time-locked auditory and visual interval indicators, in conjunction with observations of the listener's behavior, to determine which interval contained the target signal.\nProgram the software to indicate which interval contains the signal only after the observer has entered a response.\nProgram the custom software to execute the three stages of the testing protocol. The purpose and main features of each stage are as follows:\nIn Stage 1, present the signal at a fixed and clearly audible level, always in interval 2. Select the training level intensity based on pilot data. After three trials in Stage 1, program the software to prompt the observer to either repeat Stage 1 or initiate Stage 2.\n\t\tNOTE: The purpose of Stage 1, the operant conditioning stage, is to teach the listener to perform a play-based, motor response as soon as he/she hears the signal.",
    "In Stage 2, program the software to allow the signal to occur in either interval 1 or interval 2, with equal a priori probability. Present the signal at the same audible level used in Stage 1. Program Stage 2 to continue until the observer correctly judges the observation interval containing the signal on 4 out of 5 consecutive trials.\n\t\tNOTE: The purpose of Stage 2, the verification stage, is to ensure the observer can reliably judge the interval containing the signal based solely on the child's behavior.\nProgram Stage 3 to collect experimental data. In this example, the software is program to run an adaptive track procedure in Stage 3. The signal occurs in either interval 1 or interval 2, with equal a priori probability.\n\t\tNOTE: The present example uses a 2-down, 1-up adaptive tracking procedure to estimate the signal level associated with 71% correct detection16. The track continues for 8 reversals, and threshold is based on the last 6 reversals.\nProgram the software to also present probe trials in Stage 3. Responses on probe trials reflect consistency of responses to supra-threshold signals across the testing session. During a probe trial, present the signal at the same clearly audible level used in the two training stages (Stage 1 and Stage 2). Randomly present probe trials twice out of every 12 trials. Consider a track invalid if the average probe hit rate is <80%.\nFor all three stages, program the software to require the observer to initiate a trial by clicking on a response box in the user interface.\nProgram the user interface to allow the observer to click on a box to indicate which interval contained the signal. After the response is entered, provide feedback to the observer indicating the interval that contained the signal.",
    "Program the software to activate two mechanical toys with lights that are located in dark Plexiglas boxes in the testing room.\nUse mechanical toys as reinforcements, in addition to an assistant providing social reinforcement in the test booth.\nDesign the program to maintain a consistent delay between the signal and the activation of the toy, regardless of whether the signal occurs in interval 1 or 2. If the signal occurs in interval 1, the mechanical toy is activated immediately following the observer's response. If the signal occurs in interval 2, the mechanical toy activation is delayed by the interval duration plus the inter-stimulus interval (1,365 msec in this example).\nActivate the mechanical toy only if the observer correctly judges the interval that contained the signal.\n3. Data Collection\nPrepare the environment before the child arrives to the laboratory, as detailed in Figure 1.\nSelect 4 to 6 games for the test session based on the child's age, motor control, and interests. Examples include placing pegs into a board, putting blocks into a bucket, completing a puzzle, and placing felt pieces onto a board to make a scene.\nComplete a listening check of the experimental stimuli and the observer-assistant communication system.\nAs soon as the child and parent arrive at the laboratory, obtain informed consent for participation in the study.\nInstruct the child and parent to enter the booth. Children typically prefer that a parent sits next to them inside of the booth, and in some cases the child sits on the parent's lap.\nUsing child-friendly language, give the child and parent an overview of the task. Describe the sound(s) that the child will hear and model the targeted motor response.\nHave the experimenter or the assistant place the insert earphone or supra-aural headphones on the child.",
    "Position the child at eye-level, and allow the child to see and feel the insert earphone or headphone prior to placement.\nProvide the child with a sense of control by allowing him/her to choose where to clip the transducer or by having the child assist the experimenter in placing the headphones.\nIf the child is reluctant to wear headphones, place the transducer on the parent or a doll to model the procedure.\nTerminate the testing session if in the unlikely event that the child is unwilling to wear the transducer or becomes distressed.\nIf the parent prefers to be in the control room during testing, have the observer escort the parent to the control room. Allow the parent to hear and see the child from the control room.\nHave the assistant verify that the booth door(s) are closed.\nHave the assistant place headphones on his/her ears in order to hear the observer in the control room, as well as the audio prompt marking each interval.\nHave the assistant give the child a toy (e.g., a block) and instruct the child to place the object against his/her torso or cheek. This placement of the toy is called the \"ready\" position; the child uses this position throughout testing.\nRequire the observer to initiate a trial only if the child is in the ready position.\nHave the observer initiate the conditioning stage (Stage 1). The goal of this Stage 1 is to condition the child to make a clear, time-locked motor response when he/she hears the target signal.\nTo facilitate learning the task, have the assistant and child initially \"listen together\" using a hand-over-hand technique.",
    "Have the assistant place his/her hand on the child's hand. Have the assistant move the child's hand when the assistant hears the auditory interval marker for the second interval in his/her headset, because the signal is always present in interval 2 during Stage 1.\nAlternatively, have the assistant perform the task in parallel with the child.\nHave the assistant reduce the level of assistance with subsequent trials.\nIf the child is slow to respond, encourage the child to respond as soon as he/she hears the target signal or ask the child to \"race\" the assistant.\nContinue presenting trials in Stage 1 until the observer is confident the child's responses are under stimulus control.\nHave the observer make this decision based on (1) whether the child is able to perform the motor task without assistance, and (2) whether the child is able to make a fast, time-locked response to the signal that the observer can judge.\nRequire a minimum of 3 trials in this stage.\nHave the observer initiate Stage 2 of testing.\n\tNOTE: In this stage, neither the observer nor the assistant know which test interval contains the signal. The observer must accurately judge 4 out of 5 sequential trials to successfully complete this stage.\n\tNOTE: The child is considered trained with the successful completion of Stages 1 and 2. If more than one session is needed, suspend the testing session at this point. It is recommended that testing resumes within two weeks. At the second visit, present a few reminder trials (using Stage 1) prior to initiating Stage 3 of testing.",
    "Initiate Stage 3 to collect experimental data. As in Stage 2, have the observer closely watch the listener and judge which interval contains the signal. In addition to the motor-based play response, have the observer watch for subtle behaviors.\nNOTE: Children often exhibit subtle behaviors to sound, including eye or head movement, changes in facial expression, and quieting of activity17,18. Have the observer use these subtle behaviors to judge which interval contained the signal when the signal level is near a child's threshold.\nHave the assistant switch the game every 10-15 trials to maximize the child's interest and reduce the risk of habituation9. Have the assistant provide frequent social reinforcement to the child to engage the child and to shape and maintain the child's behavior.\nIf the child stops responding in a consistent manner, the child may have \"forgotten\" what the signal sounds like or may have habituated to the play-based task. Employ the following strategies to increase the child's participation:\nHave the assistant reinstruct the child and model the response for the child. Have the assistant introduce a new game.\nProvide more reinforcement, either by increasing social reinforcement from the assistant or activating the mechanical toys controlled by the custom software.\nFor 2 and 3 year-olds, terminate testing after the completion of Stage 3. For children who are 4 years or older, run a second adaptive track if desired. Prior to starting a second track, give children a short break (5-10 min) to play.\nAt the conclusion of testing, complete a screening tympanogram to evaluate middle ear functioning. Perform the screening at the end of the visit because some children are more receptive to this procedure after spending time in the test environment and becoming familiar with the testers.\nCompensate the participant and schedule a follow-up visit, if needed.",
    "4. Data Analysis\nAverage the signal level at the last 6 reversals of the adaptive track to calculate the detection threshold.\nCompute the standard deviation of the last 6 reversal levels. In order for a threshold to be considered valid, the standard deviation must be below a criterion established based on pilot data. A high standard deviation indicates that the reversal levels were widely spaced, possibly due to inconsistencies in the observer's judgements or listeners factors such as training effects, fatigue, or off-task behaviors.\nCalculate the hit rate for probe trials by determining the proportion of probe signal trials that were correctly judged by the observer during Stage 3 of testing. In order for a threshold to be considered valid, the probe hit rate must meet the minimum criterion of 0.80. Failure to meet this criterion is because of inconsistent responses to supra-threshold signals, which may indicate fatigue, off-task behavior, or inadequate training for the listener and/or the observer."
