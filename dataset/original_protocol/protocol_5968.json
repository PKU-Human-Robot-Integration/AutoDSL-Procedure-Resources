    "See Figure 3A for the outline of the whole procedure.Prior to testingAssign each of the 8 escape holes a letter from A-H going clockwise. Assign an escape box to one of the maze holes and attach the escape box to the rotating arm positioned under this hole. Keep this position consistent for the remainder of training (Days 2-3). Assign four drop-off locations (start location 1-4) by dividing the maze equally into four quadrants (Figure 3B).Exploration in dim lighting (Day 1)Place home cage in biosafety hood in the testing room for 15 min prior to maze exposure for habituation. With a sharpie, mark each animal a different color on the tail. Set room lights to lowest intensity (~25 lux) and keep visual cues unaltered throughout all testing Days 1-4. Place bubble wrap or foam on the floor around the circumference of the maze to cushion any falls. There is no escape box for Day 1 exploration.Open ULead video software and focus camera for dim lighting. Ensure the maze is centered in the picture and evenly spaced from the edges of the room when viewed with the camera. Clean the maze with 70% ethanol and allow 60 s to dry.Add one scoop (approximately 8.8 g) of soy infant formula powder to a 50 ml Falcon tube and fill with distilled water. Shake vigorously until formula has fully been dissolved. Fill one syringe or pipette with ~1 ml mixed soy infant formula and scatter dime-sized droplets fairly equally around the entire face of the maze.Gently carry the animal to the platform and place it in the center of the maze apparatus. Allow the animal to explore for 15 min. Record the time between the releases of the animal and when the 15 min of exploration is up.",
    "If the animal falls, quickly place it back in the center of the maze and watch its movement to detect any injury. Note: If falls are frequent, a raised border (~1 cm high) made of a serpentine automotive belt or similar material can be installed around the maze edge. Similar inserts inside of maze holes can also be used. Clean the maze with 70% ethanol and replace mixed soy infant formula droplets for the next animal. Wipe gloved hands with 70% ethanol in between handling different animals for this and all subsequent steps.Training (Days 2-3) (Figure 3E) (Video 1)<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Training trial. (All procedures were performed in accordance with the regulations stated in the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals by the National Research Council and approved by the George Mason University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.)Set room lights to their highest intensity (~525 lux).Place the home cage in the biosafety cabinet and allow animals 15 min in the home cage for habituation prior to testing the first animal. Clean the escape box and maze with 70% ethanol.Training consists of 5 blocks, with each block containing 4 trials (a 6th ‘refresher’ block will be administered after an immediate probe only on Day 3). The trials allow the animal 60 s to locate the escape box. The order of the four start locations varies randomly for each block, and remains consistent for all animals tested in the litter. Hold a stopwatch in one hand and place animal at the designated quadrant facing the center of the maze with its rear paws in line with the escape holes (Figure 3C). Immediately after placing the animal in the maze, move out of sight behind the curtain and observe the animal’s behavior on the video display.",
    "Record the time between the releases of the animal and when all four paws enter the escape box (Figure 3D). If the animal does not locate the escape box within 60 s, hold the scruff on the upper back of the animal and gently guide its front paws to the escape hole. Clean maze apparatus and escape box with 70% ethanol prior to each block. When the last animal has completed block 1, repeat with the first animal for block 2. For a single animal, the start of one block and the next block should be within 15 to 30 min. After completion of the 5 training blocks, begin the immediate probe.Immediate probe (Days 2-3)The immediate probe is used to test the animal’s recall of the goal location after training.The immediate probe is a 60 s probe directly following the five blocks of training trials. After five blocks of training have been completed, remove the escape box from the platform. Assign a start location for the probe at one of the four start locations opposite to the escape box location (Figure 3B). For instance, if the escape box was positioned under hole ‘G’ during the training trials, the opposite is start location 2 (S2). Therefore, S2 would be assigned as the start location for the immediate probe. The same probe start location is used for all subsequent probe trials and remains consistent within each litter. Begin the probe by placing the animal at the designated start location and allow 60 s for the animal to explore the maze.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181113/20181113021458_4671.jpgFigure 3.

The green arrow displays the release location, and the red star marks the goal location.Refresher block (Day 3)Following the Day 3 immediate probe, a 6th block (4 trials with an escape box exactly like blocks 1-5) is administered to reinforce learning. This is to ensure the animal is still motivated to find the escape location during the 24 HP on Day 4.24-Hour probe (Day 4) (Figure 3E)The 24-h probe is similar to the immediate probes but begins approximately 24 h after the start of the final training period and is used to assess long-term spatial memory.Turn lights to their highest intensity with no escape box present and allow the animal 60 s to explore the maze."
