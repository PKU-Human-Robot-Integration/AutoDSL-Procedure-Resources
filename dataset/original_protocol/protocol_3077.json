    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nVirus injection in dorsal CA1\nTiming: 2–3 h\nCalcium imaging requires both viral expression and GRIN lens insertion in the target location. For dorsal CA1 calcium imaging, we separate the virus injection and lens implantation steps because performing both steps concurrently may lead to viral elimination due to aspiration of brain tissue for lens implantation. Therefore, we inject the virus and wait for adequate viral expression before implanting the lens. Setting the precise surgical coordinate is a critical step in this process.\nAnesthetize the mouse.\nPut the mouse in an anesthesia induction chamber and fill it with 3% isoflurane at a rate of 1 L/min for anesthesia by inhalation.\nNote: This step takes about 5 min. The criteria for successful anesthesia are relaxation of the body and tail muscles, gasping once every second, and no response to toe or tail pinching.\nFix the mouse’s head in the stereotaxic.\nPlace the mouse’s nose inside an anesthesia mask supplying 3% isoflurane.\nFix the mouse’s head with ear bars.\nSet the Homeothermic system temperature to 33.5°C to keep the mouse body temperature stable during surgery.\nTrim the hair and incise the skin on top of the head (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2821-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Diagram of the surgical area\nThe pink oval indicates the hair-trimming area. The red vertical line indicates the incision line.\nDisinfect the surgical site with chlorhexidine gluconate solution.\nUse scissors to trim the hair.\nClean the surgical site with chlorhexidine gluconate solution.\nDab the surgical site with lidocaine solution (∼100 μL).\nInject ketoprofen solution via IM (100 μL/g).\nMake a 1.2 cm incision along the midline of the skin (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nApply Eye lubricant to the mouse’s eyes to keep them from drying out.\nScrub the skull.",
    "Gently push the skin to the left and right with sterilized cotton swabs to widen the incision.\nClean the exposed skull with a sterilized dry cotton swab and a saline-dipped cotton swab. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nLevel the skull.\nFasten a 22–26 gauge needle to the stereotaxic holder.\nPut ink on the tip of the needle and gently touch the bregma and lambda with the needle to mark them.\nNote: The bregma is the point at which the trend line of the coronal suture meets the midline, and the lambda is the center of the triangle whose vertices are the intersection point of the lambdoid suture with the sagittal suture and the bent points of the lambdoid suture.\nEstimate the difference between the bregma and lambda along the dorsal-ventral axis using the needle.\nLevel the bregma and lambda along the dorsal-ventral axis by adjusting the dorsal/ventral adjustment dial of the stereotaxic.\nRepeat steps 5c–d until the relative difference between the bregma and lambda is smaller than 0.02 mm.\nMark the surgical site (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2821-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Skull marking and drilling for dorsal CA1 virus injection\n(A) Marking the drilling site.\n(B) A square-shaped hole was made by drilling.\nMark the point 1.94 mm posterior to the bregma.\nMark the target point 1.40 mm laterally from the point marked in 6a.\nMake four marks, one each in the anterior, posterior, medial, and lateral directions, 0.60 mm from the target point.\nDrill a hole (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B).\nMount the drill bit on a micro hand drill.\nCreate a square-shaped opening in the skull by drilling (the length of sides: ∼1.2 mm).\nDrill the largest hole possible within the area marked in step 6c.\nVerify that the lens fits into the opening.\nNote: It is recommended to take care not to tear the dura mater.",
    "Inject virus.\nPrepare virus injection.\nFill the Hamilton syringe with the virus (1 μL for each mouse).\nLocate the injection site.\nPlace the Hamilton syringe over one of the target sites (site 1, 1.94 mm posterior and 1.15 mm lateral to the bregma; site 2, 1.94 mm posterior and 1.6 mm lateral to the bregma).\nLower the Hamilton syringe to 1.1 mm below the brain surface, which is 0.05 mm above the target site.\nPause point: Wait 5 min for the brain tissue to stabilize.\nInject 0.4 μL of the virus at a rate of 0.05 μL/min. It takes 8 min to inject the virus.\nVerify that the virus level in the Hamilton syringe decreases.\nNote: If the virus level does not decrease, remove the Hamilton syringe from the brain and gently clear the tip of the glass pipet with saline-soaked Cutanplast. If it doesn’t work, then cut the tip of the glass pipet slightly or replace it with a new one.\nPause point: Allow 10 min after virus injection for the virus to spread in the brain tissue.\nMove the Hamilton syringe upwards.\nRepeat steps 8b–8f for the injection at the second site.\nSeal the hole.\nBlend the Kwik-Sil solution.\nFill the hole with the Kwik-Sil mixture.\nPause point: Wait 3 min for the mixture to set.\nSuture the skin.\nInsert a suture needle through the skin on both sides.\nTie a knot.\nRepeat steps 10a and 10b until the skin is completely closed.\nPause point: Wait for 2 weeks for viral expression. Viral injection and lens implantation are performed on two different days as explained earlier.\nLens implantation in the dorsal CA1\nTiming: 1–2 h",
    "The brain tissue above the target recording site is removed, a GRIN lens (1.0 × 4.0 mm) is positioned in the target site, and the lens is fixed with cement. Properly positioning the lens and securely fixing it in place are critical steps here.\nRepeat steps 1–5 except for hair trimming and skin incision.\nRemove skin with an isosceles trapezoid incision (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2821-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. Diagram for skin incision\nThe pink oval indicates the hair-trimming area. The red quadrangle indicates the incision area.\nMake a small skin incision along the ear bar line about the length of the distance between the eyes.\nCut the skin obliquely to the inner corner of each eye, leaving enough space between the eyes and incision lines.\nCut the skin near the eyes.\nApply 3M Vetbond along the cutting line of the skin to attach the skin to the skull. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nNote: Skipping step 11b may lead to skin inflammation; it may also allow skin growth into the space between the skull and cement, ultimately causing the cement to detach from the skull.\nFix the head plate with screws (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]). Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2821-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10. Diagram for fixing the head plate and screws on the skull\nThe head plate is secured with two screws slightly in front of the coronal suture. An additional screw is secured to the skull above the cerebellum.\nSoak the head plate and screws in chlorhexidine gluconate solution for sterilization.\nAlign the head plate slightly in front of the coronal suture and use a micro hand drill to create an indentation on the skull beneath each screw hole.\nMark the location for another screw above the cerebellum and at that location make another indentation on the skull using a micro hand drill.",
    "Use a screwdriver to secure the head plate and the screw in point 12c.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2821-Fig11.jpg\nFigure 11. Aspiration of the brain tissue above the dorsal CA1 target site\n(A) Photograph taken while aspirating. The brain tissue above the hippocampus is removed while saline is supplied.\n(B) Schematic showing the removal of the brain tissue above the hippocampus and the positioning of the lens. The red dotted line indicates the reference point for lens positioning along the dorsal-ventral axis.\nNote: Fasten the screws to barely penetrate the skull (less than 1 mm deep from the skull surface). Avoid overtightening the screws, which may damage brain tissues and cause inflammation.\nRemove the cortex above the hippocampus (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]A).\nRemove the Kwik-Sil applied in step 9 to expose the hole.\nSet up the suction setup.\nTurn on the suction pump and set the vacuum pressure at over 50 kPa.\nRemove the cortex over the target site by aspiration until the corpus callosum appears (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]B).\nPlace the suction needle tip on the brain tissue to be removed. While absorbing, use an insulin syringe to apply saline to ensure a clear view and prevent blockage.\nRemove brain tissue in the middle of the hole more deeply than at the edge, creating a funnel-shaped hollow by adjusting the angle of the suction needle.\nStop the aspiration when white tissue (corpus callosum) appears (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]B).\nNote: Make sure not to over-remove brain tissue. The cortical tissue surrounding the hollow plays a role in holding the implanted lens in place. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]\nTurn off the suction pump.\nAbsorb blood using Cutanplast. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nFill the hollow with saline-soaked Cutanplast.\nNote: Hydrate the Cutanplast with saline to prevent the blood clot formation.\nWait until bleeding stops.",
    "Optional: Change the Cutanplast with a new one if it cannot absorb all of the blood.\nAfter bleeding has stopped, use Cutanplast to gently remove any remaining blood clots.\nIf bleeding resumes, apply Cutanplast until it stops.\nImplant the lens.\nNote: The GRIN lens (1.0 × 4.0 mm) should be sterilized with chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to implantation. The size of a GRIN lens for the dorsal CA1 differs from that for the ventral CA1.\nFix the dorsal lens holder to the stereotaxic holder.\nTurn on the suction pump and increase the vacuum pressure to more than 50 kPa.\nLoad the lens onto the tip assembly.\nNote: Make sure that the lens holder holds the lens firmly in place. Ensure that the lens plane is parallel to the skull.\nAlign the center of the lens to the reference point in step 6a (1.94 mm posterior and 1.4 mm lateral to the bregma).\nAdjust the lens’ dorsal-ventral positioning using the skull as a reference (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]B).\nLower the lens to just above the skull.\nCarefully move the lens to the medial side and confirm that it is just above the skull.\nNote: The surface of the medial edge of the hole in the skull serves as the dorsal-ventral axis reference point.\nLower the lens to 1.7 mm below the position in step 14e.\nLower the lens to 0.7 mm below the position in step 14e (this can be done rapidly).\nSlowly lower the lens a further 1.0 mm at a speed of 0.2 mm/min.",
    "Critical: Stop lowering the lens if blood begins to leak out of the hollow. Use Cutanplast to absorb any minor bleeding and wait for it to stop. In the event of significant bleeding, lift the lens, clean the lens if it is dirty, absorb the blood with Cutanplast, and wait for the bleeding to stop. Then, begin lowering the lens again.\nFix the lens with cement (Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]).\nOptional: If the hole is too large and the cortex is exposed between the lens and the skull, fill the gap with Kwik-Sil.\nCover the lens, skull, head plate, and screw with Super Bond C&B (Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]A).\nCritical: The tip assembly should not be covered with cement.\nAfter the cement has hardened, switch off the suction pump and disconnect the lens holder from the suction pump to relieve pressure.\nRemove the lens from the tip assembly.\nOptional: If necessary, use additional dental cement to cover exposed portions of the skull, lens, head plate, and screw (Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]B).\nPause point: Wait for the cement to harden for at least 10 min.\nApply Kwik-Cast and Kwik-Sil to the lens to prevent lens damage.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2821-Fig12.jpg\nFigure 12. Cementing the lens in place after dorsal CA1 implantation\n(A) Photograph taken after the initial Super Bond C&B cementing.\n(B) Photograph taken after the second dental cementing.\n(C) Diagram showing how the lens is cemented. The lens is fixed first with Super Bond C&B (hatched area) and then with dental cement (pink).\nCover the lens with Kwik-Cast.\nApply Kwik-Sil to cover the upper portion of the dental cement, including the area where Kwik-Cast has been applied.\nPause point: Wait for 1–2 weeks for stabilization.\nVirus injection and lens implantation in the ventral CA1\nTiming: 4–5 h",
    "This step is for ventral CA1 calcium imaging in a new group of mice. In this section, we inject virus into the ventral CA1, lower the lens into the ventral CA1, and fix the lens with cement in the same manner as for dorsal CA1 calcium imaging. However, due to the ventral CA1’s deep location in the brain, the lens is lowered very slowly and without suctioning brain tissue. Setting the precise surgical coordinate is a critical step here.\nRepeat step 11 with a new mouse.\nMark the surgery site (Figure 13[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig13]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2821-Fig13.jpg\nFigure 13. Marking and drilling for ventral CA1 surgery\nMark the point 3.16 mm posterior to the bregma.\nMark the target point 3.50 mm laterally from the point 18a.\nMake four marks, one each in the anterior, posterior, medial, and lateral directions, 0.60 mm from the target point.\nDrill a hole.\nRepeat step 7 but with the length of the square-shaped opening’s sides reduced to about 0.8 mm.\nInject virus.\nPrepare the virus injection as in step 8.\nThe virus is injected at two sites (3.16 mm posterior and 3.5 mm lateral to the bregma; 3.5 and 3.7 mm ventral to the brain surface).\nEach injection has a volume of 0.3 μL, and an injection speed of 0.05 μL/min. It takes about 6 min to complete virus injection.\nPause point: Allow 10 min after virus injection for the virus to spread in the brain tissue.\nFix the head plate with screws (Figure 14[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig14]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2821-Fig14.jpg\nFigure 14. Positioning of the head plate, lens holder, and skull screw\n(A) Diagram showing the arrangement of the head plate, lens holder, and skull screw. These elements should be positioned far enough apart that they do not obstruct each other.",
    "(B) Photograph showing the placement of the head plate, lens holder, and skull screw after lens implantation in the ventral CA1.\nBefore tightening the screws, make sure that the lens holder, head plate and screws are correctly placed.\nThe lens holder must be positioned inside the surgical area.\nWhile being lowered, the lens and the holder should not be obstructed by the head plate.\nThe additional screw should be positioned differently than it was during dorsal CA1 surgery to prevent it from colliding with the lens holder.\nRepeat step 12.\nLocate the lens target site.\nInstall the lens holder onto the stereotaxic holder.\nAdjust the lens position as described in step 14e.\nPosition the GRIN lens (0.6 × 7.3 mm) to 3.16 mm posterior and 3.5 mm lateral to the bregma.\nLower the lens. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nLower the lens by 0.2 mm every 2 min, down to 2.0 mm from the brain surface.\nLower the lens by 0.1 mm every 2 min, down to 3.0 mm from the brain surface.\nLower the lens by 0.05 mm every 2 min, down to 3.6 mm from the brain surface.\nCritical: Stop lowering the lens if blood begins to leak out during insertion. Absorb blood with Cutanplast and wait for bleeding to stop. Then, begin lowering the lens again. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]\nFix the lens with cement (Figure 15[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig15]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2821-Fig15.jpg\nFigure 15.

    "Cover the first and second holes of the lens holder with Super bond C&B, but leave the third hole uncovered.\nDisconnect the lens from the holder (Figures 15[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig15]B–15D).\nGently cut the third hole in the lens holder with nippers (Figures 15[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig15]B and 15D).\nCritical: The thickness of the lens holder is 1 mm. Do not cut the lens holder all at once, as the lens may be damaged during cutting. Rather, cut the posterior side of the hole first, and then the anterior side.\nApply cement again to the lens.\nApply dental cement to cover the cut lens holder and to make the dental cement surface rounded and smooth.\nOptional: If necessary, use additional dental cement to cover exposed portions of the skull, lens, head plate, and screws (Figure 15[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig15]E).\nPause point: Wait for the cement to harden for at least 10 min.\nApply Kwik-Cast and Kwik-Sil to the lens to prevent lens damage.\nPause point: Wait for 3–4 weeks for viral expression.\nBaseplate mounting\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThe Inscopix microscope (nVista) is mounted on the baseplate. In this step, a UV resin is used to build a baseplate foundation and fix the baseplate to the foundation. The mounting procedure is the same for the dorsal and ventral CA1. Proper positioning of the baseplate is critical because the microscope’s focus range is restricted.\nRepeat steps 1–2.\nRemove the Kwik-Sil and Kwik-Cast cover and clean the lens.\nRemove the Kwik-Cast and Kwik-Sil using forceps.\nGently wipe the lens with a cotton swab soaked with 70% ethanol.\nFind the focal plane.\nSet up the nVista system.\nAssemble the baseplate and the Inscopix microscope.\nNote: A loose connection between the microscope and baseplate may cause a change in focal plane after fixing the microscope-baseplate assembly.\nPlace the microscope above the lens.",
    "Turn on the microscope’s light and move the microscope up and down until neurons are clearly visible. Then mark that position.\nNote: It is advised to decrease the isoflurane concentration to 1% in the air because neuronal activity decreases during deep anesthesia.\nSurround the lens with black cement or black manicure to reduce light reflection around the lens (Figure 16[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig16]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2821-Fig16.jpg\nFigure 16. Surrounding the lens with black cement\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2821-Fig17.jpg\nFigure 17. Baseplate installation\n(A) Align the microscope to capture the largest number of active neurons in the focal plane.\n(B) Make a foundation for the baseplate. The foundation should not extend beyond the baseplate.\n(C) Connect the foundation and the baseplate.\n(D) Cover the foundation with black manicure to prevent light noise.\nCritical: Make sure the surface of the lens is not covered with black cement or black manicure.\nBuild a foundation for baseplate fixation (Figures 17[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig17]A–17C). Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nApply UV resin to the baseplate’s underside.\nHarden the applied UV resin using a UV beam.\nCritical: Make sure the resin does not completely cover the lens surface.\nCritical: UV protective eyewear must be worn while using the UV beam to protect the experiment’s eyes.\nRepeat steps 32a and b until the resin reaches the height of the baseplate (Figure 17[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig17]B).\nTo reinforce the resin foundation, add more resin to the spaces between the baseplate and the resin foundation (Figure 17[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig17]C).\nVerify that the focal plane has not been changed.\nNote: The focal plane may undergo changes. It is advised that the first focus of the microscope be set in the center of the focus range to accommodate small changes in the focal plane.\nUse black manicure to conceal the foundation (Figure 17[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig17]D).\nCover the foundation’s exterior with black manicure to prevent light noise.",
    "Note: Ensure that the light from by the microscope does not escape through the foundation.\nCover the baseplate with a cover."
