    "The workflow of the NAQ assay is shown in Figure 1:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180131/20180131222046_4565.jpgFigure 1. Workflow of the NAQ assay procedure. In gray are the optional steps.Nucleosome assembly reactionPrepare a 40 µl reaction in NA buffer (see Recipes) containing: 200 nM histone chaperone 200 nM (H3-H4)2 (tetramer concentration) 400 nM H2A-H2B (dimer concentration)Notes: It is important to pipette the histone chaperone first, as the histones are destabilized at low salt concentration. Histones are added subsequently in any order. Octamer preparations (Dyer et al., 2004) (200 nM) can also be used instead of separate (H3-H4)2 and H2A-H2B addition.Keep the stock solutions at 4 °C, but the reaction at room temperature (20 °C).We normally set up reactions for multiple histone chaperone concentrations, usually between 100 and 800 nM (or 0.5-4 times the concentration of histones and DNA components).Always include a ‘no chaperone’ reaction (where only histones are present), a chaperone only reaction (where no histones are present) and a salt-reconstituted nucleosome reaction (pre-assembled on 207 bp DNA [Dyer et al., 2004]). These are set up in parallel and treated exactly like the assembly reactions.Incubate for 15 min at room temperature.Add 200 nM of 207 bp DNA, and mix by pipetting. Incubate for 30 min at room temperature. Proceed with the following steps and do not store the assembly reactions.Native PAGE analysis of assembled nucleosomes10 µl of the assembly reaction can be used for native PAGE analysis for validation purposes:Add 2 µl of 50% glycerol stock.Load 4 µl of the final mix onto a 6% native PAGE (see Recipes) and run in 0.2x TBE buffer (pre-run gel at 150 V at 4 °C for 1 h, see Recipes).Include a lane with a DNA ladder (50 bp DNA ladder).Run samples at 150 V for 70 min at 4 °C.",

Incubate for 10 min in a thermoblock at 37 °C Quench the reaction by adding 10 µl of 500 mM EDTA (final EDTA concentration ~50 mM).Optional: Treat the sample with 25 µg of Proteinase K (1.25 µl of a 20 mg/ml solution) for 20 min at 50 °C.Add 550 µl of PB buffer from MinElute kit (QIAGEN) and 10 µl of 3 M Na acetate pH 5.0 solution.Incubate for 10 min at room temperature. Add 50 ng of loading control DNA (stock at 25 ng/µl).Apply sample to the spin column.Centrifuge for 1 min at 16,000 x g at room temperature.Discard flow-through.Wash membrane with 100 µl of PB buffer.Centrifuge for 1 min at 16,000 x g at room temperature. Discard flow-through.Wash membrane with 700 µl of PE buffer.Centrifuge for 1 min at 16,000 x g at room temperature. Discard flow-through.Centrifuge for 1 min at 16,000 x g at room temperature. Discard flow-through.Apply 10 µl of ddH2O to the spin column (make sure the tip of the pipette is in the center of the membrane).Incubate for 10 min at room temperature.",
    "Place spin column into a clean Eppendorf tube.Centrifuge for 1 min at 16,000 x g at room temperature.Purified DNA analysis on native PAGE2.5 µl of the purified DNA can be used for native PAGE analysis for validation purposes:Add 2.5 µl of 2x DNA sample buffer. Load 5 µl of the final mix onto a 10% native PAGE (see Recipes) and run in 0.5x TBE buffer.Include a lane with 50 bp DNA ladder.Run samples at 200 V for 50 min at room temperature.Stain with SYBR GOLD stain solution for 10 min at room temperature.Image with Typhoon: Cy2/488 with PMT (photomultiplier tube) at 500 V and resolution at 100 µm.An example of native PAGE analysis of the purified DNA is shown in Figure 3.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180131/20180131222648_7057.jpgFigure 3.
