    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPart one: Preparation of micropatterned slides\nTiming: 2.5 h\nCells are seeded on CYTOOchip™ Motility glass slides (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). These glass slides (chips) are patterned with stripes of different widths that are separated by cytophobic spacer regions (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Incubating the slides with a solution containing an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein results in coating, i.e., functionalization, of the stripes to support cell adhesion and migration. The cytophobic spacer regions between the functionalized stripes prevent cell migration in lateral directions, thereby promoting cell-cell collisions.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2550-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Chamber with micropatterned chip\n(A) Components of the chip-containing chamber. After coating with an extracellular matrix, the micropatterned chip (4) is placed into the bottom plate (5). The silicone gasket (3) seals the interior of the chamber. The main body (2) of the chamber adheres magnetically to the bottom part. The chamber can be closed with a glass lid (1). The assembled chamber is placed without glass lid into the CO2 incubation chamber of the microscope for live cell imaging. At the end of the experiment, the chip can be fixed for antibody stainings and IF analysis. The individual parts are cleaned and incubated in 70% ethanol for 12–16 h. The chamber can be re-used for further experiments. The outer diameter of the chamber (bottom plate) is 35 mm; it thus fits to microscope stage inserts with holes of a diameter smaller than 35 mm.\n(B) Cartoon of a micropatterned chip. The chip contains functionalized stripes of different widths (2.5 μm–20 μm) that are coated with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. The ECM-coated stripes are separated by cytophobic spacer regions which prevent adhesion and migration outside of the functionalized stripes.",
    "Note that cells must be handled under sterile culture conditions. The following steps are performed under a laminar air flow bench to maintain sterile culture conditions. Keep in mind that all regarents are autoclaved or sterile-filtered before use. The chips can be used directly from the original packaging without further measures. The chamber is incubated for 12–16 h in 70% ethanol. additional measures are not required.\nPrepare coating solution with a 2× concentration of the ECM protein in PBS−/− (for vitronectin we used a final concentration for coating 10 μg/mL; we generated a stock solution of 1 mg/mL in PBS−/−).\nFor each micropatterned slide, prepare 2 mL of the 2× concentrated (20 μg/mL) coating solution.\nFor easier handling when coating and washing the chip, place the micropatterned slide into a well of a 6 well tissue culture dish (required area: approx. 9 cm2). The chip can be used directly and does not need to be pretreated or sterilized beforehand.\nNote: The micropatterned slide must be placed with the pattern (top side) facing up.\nNote: Avoid touching the slide to prevent any damage to the micropattern areas by using forceps. Alternatively, place the 6-well plate face down over the opened blister tray with the chip, flip them over and let the chip fall into the well plate.\nNote: The coating of the chip may also be performed directly in the chamber which reduces handling steps. We preferred to perform the coating in 6-well plates to ensure sterility of the samples.\nAdd 2 mL of PBS−/− to the 6-well containing the micropatterned slide, make sure that the slide is completely covered.\nAdd 2 mL of the 2×-concentrated coating solution.",
    "Note: Adding the 2× coating solution to the chip submerged in PBS−/− ensures that the chip is completely covered by liquid when the coating is added. This prevents heterogeneous coating which may result in non-specific attachment of cells.\nIncubate the chip for 2 h at 20°C–25°C.\nWashing the chip: The functionalized stripes must be prevented from drying out. Therefore, the coating solution is gradually diluted by several washing steps.\nAdd 4 mL of PBS−/−, swirl the plate gently, then remove a volume of 4 mL.\nRepeat this procedure 5 times.\nNote: for the last two washing steps use cell culture medium instead of PBS−/−.\nTransfer the chip into the bottom plate of the 1 well - CYTOOchamber™ with the patterns again facing up using tweezers (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). Assemble the chamber.\nImmediately add 1 mL PBS−/− to prevent the micropatterned slide from drying out.\nTransfer the chamber into a cell culture dish with lid.\nCritical: The surface of the chip must be prevented from drying out as drying of the chips’ surface may lead to non-specific attachment of cells to the cytophobic spacer regions. Therefore, make sure that the chip is always covered with liquid.\nNote: After coating, the chip should be stored for no more than one day in the refrigerator at 2°C–8°C before starting the experiment. Uncoated chips can be stored at 2°C–8°C for about 2 months.\nPart two: Seeding of MCF-7 cells\nTiming: 3.5 h\nWhen seeding the cells, it is important to have a homogeneous single cell suspension without cell clusters. Likewise, the cells should be spread evenly over the chip in order to make optimal use of the micropatterned surface. It is also important to ensure that the cells are completely adherent to the surface of the chip before starting live cell recording.",
    "Note: Make sure that you prepare cell suspensions of both collision partners, which may be the same or different cell types, depending on the experimental setting.\nNote: The following instructions (regarding cell handling, trypsinization, centrifugation and washing) are based on MCF-7 cells. For other cell lines, different volumes and incubation times may apply. In particular, the incubation of cells with Trypsin/EDTA may vary depending on the cell line.\nHarvest the cells.\nWash cells with PBS−/−/5 mM EDTA.\nAdd Trypsin/EDTA solution for 5 min at 37°C (for a 10 cm cell culture dish 1.5 mL Trypsin/EDTA).\nStop the reaction by adding 5 volumes of cell culture medium.\nCentrifuge cells (200 g, 4 min, 20°C–25°C).\nResuspend cell pellet in 5 mL cell culture medium.\nPass the cells through a sieve with 40 μm pore size to remove large cell clusters and cellular debris.\nCount the cells.\nResuspend cells in medium to obtain a cell suspension of 50.000 cells/mL for each cell type.\nMix equal volumes of the two cell types (1 + 1) to generate a cell suspension with a concentration of 50.000 cells/mL.\nAspirate the PBS−/− solution from the chip, preferably with a 1,000-μL pipette from the edge of the chip without touching the surface; carefully add 450 μL of the mixed cell suspension (22.500 cells in total) to the chip.\nNote: Cells should be added slowly and dropwise to cover the entire chip.\nClose the lid of the cell culture dish and leave the chamber under the hood for 10 min, allowing cells to settle down; then transfer the cells to the incubator.\nTroubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] Avoid swirling of the chamber to prevent accumulation of the cells in the center of the chip.",
    "Incubate the cells for an additional 30 min to allow the cells to settle and spread at the chip surface.\nFill up the CYTOOchamber™ to 2 mL in total with medium.\nIncubate again for additional 3 h to ensure the complete spreading of the cells.\nTroubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3] If cells are not completely attached to the surface of the chip, extend the incubation time for 1–2 h before starting image acquisition. MCF-7 cells should have settled almost completely after this time. For other cell types the optimal time period may have to be tested. Optional: An immunostaining against the coated ECM protein may be performed to confirm the correct functionalization of the stripes.\nPart three: Microscopic observation and live cell imaging\nTiming: 16 h\nLive-cell microscopy images of the cells were taken with a LSM780 (Carl Zeiss) confocal microscope. The Plan-Neofluar ×20/0.5 objective allows the identification of single cells. However, this magnification does not provide a complete overview of the entire chip.\nThe time of image recording may be adjusted for each cell type. For MCF-7 cells, image acquisition over a time period of approximately 15 h in 10-min intervals has turned out to be suitable. The first cell collisions events can be observed after approx. 10 h.\nPlace the CYTOOchamber™ under the microscope. Make sure that the incubation chamber is heated to 37°C and that there is a constant inflow of 5% CO2.\nNote: The main body of the chamber has an outer diameter of 35 mm. The microscope inlay must have a suitable recess for this. We have used an inlay with an approximately 30 mm round cutout.\nSet the focus on the cells using the Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) mode of the microscope.",
    "Move around the entire chip by zooming in and out, specifying several Z-positions that will be later successively approached when capturing the microscopy images.\nNote: Selecting several Z-positions helps to optimize focus stability over the time period of 15 h. In these experiments, a number of 7 Z- positions has proven to be appropriate.\nSearch for suitable coordinates (X and Y position) that could lead to a collision provided that the cells continue to migrate.\nIdentify two collision partners (e.g., JAM-A KD cells and JAM-A WT cells) in close proximity. Cells can be distinguished by their different fluorescent markers.\nNote: Cells can migrate in both dimensions. MCF-7 migrate approx. 60 μm in 15 h, which corresponds to approximately 5% of a stripe at a speed of about 0.3–0.4 μm/min. Therefore, cells must not be too far away from each other at the beginning of the acquisition. With a 20× objective, a track length of approximately 600–1,200 μm can be set - depending on the focus chosen. Thus, there would be more track length available for cell migration, even if the collision partners ultimately move at different speeds. If the remaining track length is too long and the cells do not meet in the predicted time, a denser seeding of the cells can be attempted. Should the cells migrate significantly faster, a smaller magnification must be selected.",
    "Note: Approx. 10 different positions can be selected for a total acquisition time of 15 h, and several cell collision events can be observed in one position. However, this will vary depending on various factors including the used microscope, the area of the set position, or the desired image quality (with lower resolution, the exposure time can be reduced and, consequently, more positions can be addressed). In this study, we have routinely scanned an area of 716 × 716 × 7 pixels (607 × 607 × 17 μm) with a zoom of 0.7, requiring 6 s of scanning time per image. Using these settings, approx. 40–60 collision events can be observed in a single experiment. The optimal settings should be determined in a pilot experiment.\nAfter starting the recording of cell behavior, follow the first image acquisition cycle to make sure that all positions are approached and that the focus is correctly set.\nEnd of image acquisition: after 15 h (corresponds to 90 cycles with images taken at 10-min intervals).\nCritical: The CYTOOchip™ Motility chips contain functionalized stripes of different widths (2.5 μm, 5 μm, 10 μm, 20 μm). For MCF-7 cells (cell diameter approx. 15 μm), stripes of 5 μm width turned out to be optimal. On 2.5 μm stripes, cell migration was less efficient, most likely because of the elongated cell shapes forced by the narrow stripes. On stripes wider than 5 μm, the frequencies of cell collisions were reduced. The optimal widths may vary and should be determined for each cell type. It is important, however, to analyze collision events that occurred on stripes with identical widths only.\nPart four: Cell fixation after live cell image acquisition\nFixation for subsequent immunofluorescence analysis\nTiming: 2 days",
    "The cells adhering to the micropatterned stripes can be fixed and processed for further microscopic analysis. This allows a more detailed characterization of collided cells. For example, entotic cell-in-cell structures can be distinguished from other types of cell-in-cell structures on the basis of a Lamp1- and β-Catenin positive vacuole. Also, true cell-in-cell structure formation can be verified by confocal analysis of the fixed samples. The following steps describe the processing of the micropatterned slides for subsequent antibody stainings and immunofluorescence analysis.\nNote: when using a microscope with 4-color imaging, only one other molecule can be stained at a given time besides the two fluorescent colors of the collision partners and DAPI staining.\nTransfer the chip back into a cell culture dish, for example in a well of a 6-well plate.\nWash the cells with PBS−/−.\nFix in 4% PFA for 10 min at 20°C–25°C.\nPermeabilize the cells for 10  min in PBS−/−/0.5% Triton X-100.\nWash samples 3 times for 5 min with 100 mM glycine in PBS−/−.\nIncubate samples with antibody blocking buffer (PBS−/−, 10% FCS, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.02% BSA) for 1 h at 20°C–25°C.\nIncubate samples with primary antibodies (here: anti-LAMP1 (dilution 1:600 in blocking buffer) or anti-β-Catenin (dilution 1:500)) in antibody blocking buffer for 12–16 h at 4°C.\nWash samples 3 times for 5 min with PBS−/−.\nIncubate samples with fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h at 20°C–25°C (dilution 1:800), stain DNA with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, dilution 1:1000).\nWash again 3 times for 5 min with PBS−/−.\nThe cells can then be covered with a drop of Mowiol and embedded with a coverslip. Allow the sample to harden for 12–16 h at 20°C–25°C.\nAnalysis of cell engulfments by confocal microscopy: take Z-stacks (0.36 μm-intervals) using the 63× Plan-Apochromat oil-immersion objective (LSM800 Airyscan).",
    "Critical: When studying cell-in-cell structures using LifeAct-EGFP- or LifeAct-mCherry-expressing cells, the samples must be fixed with PFA as organic solvent-based fixation methods result in a loss of EGFP or mCherry fluorescent signals.\nFixation for subsequent analysis of cell engulfment by correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM)\nTiming: 10 days\nThe cells adhering to the micropatterned stripes can also be processed for correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM). For this, cells or cell pairs of interest are identified on the basis of their fluorescence using the confocal microscope. The position of the cells of interest must be noted using the coordinates imprinted on the chips. Confocal sections of cells of interest are taken for subsequent overlay with electron microscopy (EM) pictures. The cells can subsequently be fixed and processed for EM.\nIdentify cell pairs of interest on live cell samples using a 20× objective lens.\nNotice the position(s) of the cell pairs of interest using the coordinates imprinted on the micropatterned chip (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2550-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Micropatterned chip and identification of cell-in-cell structures by fluorescence\nThe chips consist of zones (indicated by different colors) that are imprinted with stripes of different width (2.5 μm, 5 μm, 10 μm, 20 μm, left panel). Zones are subdivided in blocks (indicated by broken lines), which are specified by coordinates (letters and numbers, middle panel). The coordinates allow the specification of blocks that contain events of interest, for example entotic cell-in-cell structures, for the subsequent analysis by electron microscopy (right panel).\nTake confocal sections Z-stacks (smallest interval possible) using a 63× objective.\nFix samples in 5% PFA, 5% glutaraldehyde (GLUT) in D-PBS (pH7.2), mixed at a 1:1 ratio with normal growth medium for 10 min at 20°C–25°C (final concentration of PFA and GLUT is 2.5% each).",
    "Replace fixation solution by 2.5% PFA, 2.5% GLUT in D-PBS (pH7.2); incubate for 4 h at 20°C–25°C. After this step, samples can be stored at 4°C for processing at later time points.\nWash samples with D-PBS for a total of 3 times (20 min per wash) at 20°C–25°C.\nIncubate with 1% osmium tetroxide in double-distilled water (ddH2O) for 1 h at 20°C–25°C.\nWash samples with ddH2O; perform 2 washes for 20 min each at 20°C–25°C and 1 wash for 20 min at 4°C.\nPerform block staining for 12–16 h with 0.5% uranyl acetate in ddH2O at 4°C.\nWash samples 2 times for 20 min with ddH2O at 20°C–25°C.\nPerform alcohol dehydration by incubation the samples for 20 min each in 50% (in ddH20), 70%, 90%, 96%, 99.8%, 99.8%, 99.8% EtOH (pure) at 20°C–25°C.\nIncubate samples in propylene oxide (100%) for 5 min at 20°C–25°C; repeat this step 1 time.\nIncubate samples with epon-propylene oxide mixtures at 20°C–25°C: epon-propylene oxide 1 + 3 (1 part epon + 3 parts propylene oxide) for 1 h; epon-propylene oxide 1 + 1 for 1 h; epon-propylene oxide 3 + 1 for 1 h; epon pure for 1 h.\nAdd fresh epon pure to sample, place a gelatin capsule above the position of interest on the micropatterned chip, incubate for 12–16 h at 20°C–25°C.\nFill the gelatin capsule with epon. Allow the epon to polymerize by incubation for 3d at 60°C.\nSeparate the gelatin capsule from the chip by incubating the chip-capsule device at two different temperatures: 60°C water bath and 4°C ice bath; the temperature shift will result in the blowing up of the glass chip; repeat step if necessary. The coordinates imprinted on the chip will be visible at the surface of the epoxy resin.",
    "Place the epoxy block under a stereomicroscope and identify the region of interest using the coordinates.\nCritical: Keep in mind that the coordinates imprinted on the micropatterns appear mirror-inverted at the bottom of the epoxy block.\nUsing a razer blade remove areas of the epoxy block which are outside the region of interest.\nUsing an ultramicrotome suitable for EM studies, generate serial sections of the cell starting from the basal side of the cell. The thickness of the sections should be 50 nm for optimal resolution.\nUse the section with optimal information content and identify the correlating confocal image (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]); overlay the two images using an imaging software.\nPart five: Analysis of contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL), entosis and cell motility\nTiming: 4 h\nTo characterize CIL in response to cell collisions it is useful to categorize cell behavior. We have distinguished four types of cell behavior in response to a collision with another cell (Post-collision events) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]): Type -2: Cells migrate in the opposite direction. Type -1: Cells do not form stable contacts but also do not actively migrate away (anergy). Type 0: Cells form stable contacts, i.e., cells remain closely associated for at least 7–8 h after collision. Type +1: Cells migrate across the collided cells. In addition to these types of CIL behavior, we have also observed cell-in-cell structures (entosis) after collisions. These events were analyzed separately.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2550-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Classification of CIL phenotypes in response to cell collisions\nType -2: Cells migrate in the opposite direction. Type -1: Cells do not form stable contacts but also do not actively migrate away (anergy). Type 0: Cells form stable contacts. Type +1: Cells migrate across the collided cells. Arrows indicate direction of migration after collision. Double arrows indicate anergic behavior.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2550-Fig4.jpg",
    "Figure 4. Flowchart of live cell imaging and analysis of post-collision CIL behavior\nCells with different fluorescent labeling suitable for live cell imaging (e.g., LifeAct-GFP, Life-Act-mCherry) are seeded on micropatterned slides, allowed to adhere, and observed for 15 h by live cell imaging. For the subsequent analysis of cell behavior in response to cell-cell collisions, it is important to include only events observed on tracks with identical width (step 1). For MCF-7 cells, a track width of 5 μm was useful. Criteria for events to be included in the analysis and classification are i) head-to-head migration for 1–2 h before collision, and ii) type-specific behavior for at least 7–8 h during the remaining observation period of 13–14 h (post-collision, steps 2 and 3).\nAnalysis of CIL.\nNote: Live cell recordings of examples of CIL behaviours (Opposite migration (Type -2), Anergy (Type -1), Contact Formation (Type 0), Continuous Migration (Type +1), examples of entosis and different types of inner cell fates (engulfment, inner cell death, inner cell escape, inner cell division), and immunofluoresence stainings of entotic vacuoles using β-catenin or Lamp1 as markers are published in references.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]\nSelect appropriate collision events: For the evaluation of cell collisions it is important that all analyzed cells have comparable chances of a collision with a neighboring cell (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], flowchart).\nFirst, exclude cells that are in close contact at the beginning of the observation period (e.g., as a result of aggregation or cell division) from the analysis.\nNote: A head-to-head migration for 1–2 h prior to collision was set as prerequisite for inclusion in the analysis of collision events.\nSecond, check that the type of migratory behavior is the dominant type during the observation period.",
    "Note: We arbitrarily defined an observation period of 7–8 h (half of the recording time) during which the cell behavior must have prevailed in order to be included into one of the four categories of post-collision behavior (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nInclude only cells on tracks with the same width into an evaluation.\nNote: For MCF-7 cells we exclusively analyzed cell behavior on tracks with 5 μm.\nCritical: For the analysis of CIL behavior it should be kept in mind that the post-collision behavior is dynamic and can change. For example, cells that behaved anergic after collison may regain migratory behaviour. Therefore, post-collision cell behavior should have prevailed for at least half of the observing time (for 15 h recording: 7.5 h–45 frames) before behavior is attributed to one of the four CIL categories.\nQuantification of cell collisions:\nAll appropriate cell collisions are assigned to the dominant type of migratory behavior. Calculate the proportion in percentage of this type in the total of analyzed cell collisions.\nTest the values of at least three independent experiments of the same experimental setup for normality of data sample distributions using the D’Agostino-Pearson normality test.\nCompare the individual migration types between control experiments and experiments with GoI cell collision.\nAnalysis of entosis.\nSelect the cells according to the same criteria as for the analysis of CIL behavior.\nNote: In parallel, the cells must not be engulfed already at the beginning of the acquisition, but the engulfment must take place during the time of observation, so that the fate of the involved cells can be followed completely.\nDivide entotic events into two groups depending on which of the collision partners is the host cell and which is the engulfed cell.\nCalculate the percentage of engulfed cell types in the total entotic events.",
    "Note: For MCF-7 cells, between 5% (Ctrl – WT) and 50% (JAM-A KD – WT) of cell collisions result in entotic engulfments.\nQuantify among the entotic events whether the inner cell is fragmentated in its host cell, undergoes cell division, or is able to escape.\nAnalysis of cell motility.\nCell motility and track displacement of the cells were analyzed using ImageJ software. Cells were tracked semi-automatically using the TrackMate plugin.\nFurther settings were made as follows:\nAlgorithm: Downsample LoG detector.\nDiameter: 60.000 px.\nThreshold: 0,01.\nFilter: median filter.\nParticle-linking algorithm: simple LAP tracker.\nView: Hyperstack Displayer.\nLinking max Distance: 250 px.\nGap-closing max distance: 100 px.\nGap-closing max frame gap: 5.\nThe track displacement covered by single cells is defined as Euclidean distance and converted from pixel to μm. The mean velocity of the cells is calculated as track displacement/total acquisition time and is given in μm/min.\nNote: When analyzing cell motility of cells grown on stripes of defined width (e.g., 5 μm), keep in mind that the physical constraints imposed by the narrow stripes could influence the motility of cells, for example by adopting an elongated shape. This should be considered when comparing data obtained from narrow stripes (1D) with data obtained from regions in the absence of constraints (2D)."
