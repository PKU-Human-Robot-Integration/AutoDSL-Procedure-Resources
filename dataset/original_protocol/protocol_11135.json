    "All surgery procedures related to the patient described here were approved by the Ethics Committees of Obstetrics & Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University in Shanghai, China. Informed consent was acquired from the patient.\n1. Indications for SLN mapping with ICG in EC patients\nEnsure that patients are clinically diagnosed with primary EC confined to the uterus with low-risk factors (grade 1 or 2 endometrioid carcinomas, pre-surgical endometrial lesion ≤2 cm, and myometrial invasion <50%).\nEnsure that patients are not allergic to the developer (ICG).\nEnsure that patients have not experienced retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for any reason before the disease.\nEnsure that the patients understand the SLN surgical procedures and have signed the surgical consent forms.\nEnsure that the patients cannot perform systematic lymphadenectomy but SLN mapping for surgical staging for any reason.\nEnsure that the patients are enrolled in the clinical trial into the SLN mapping group if they are with intermediate-high risk EC.\n2. Patient preparation\nPreoperative bowel preparation\n\t\nProvide laxatives for bowel preparation and enema to patients who have undergone multiple pelvic and abdomen surgeries.\n\t\tNOTE: Intestinal preparation is not required for patients without bowel surgery history.\nPreoperative diet preparation\n\t\nAvoid solid food for 8 h before the operation, prevent a semi-liquid diet for 6 h before the procedure, and stop drinking for 2 h before the procedure.\nAnesthesia\n\t\nUse intravenous agents (e.g., propofol) to produce unconsciousness and add some neuromuscular blockers by inhalation or intravenous routes to achieve the needed depth of anesthesia. Use a combination of administrations for anesthetic maintenance to ensure the patient to be unconscious and fully relaxed with stable vital signs throughout the operation.\n\t\tNOTE: The usage of anesthetics will be following the rules of the anesthesiology department of each center.\nPosition",
    "Once the patient is anesthetized, allow the patient to be in the lithotomy position with Trendelenburg position.\nPrepare the skin at the surgical site. Perform skin preparation with an antiseptic preparation (e.g., povidone-iodine) in an organized fashion from the intended site of the incision radiating out to the edges of the intended area of skin exposure, with the upper boundary of flat xiphoid process, side borders of mid-axillary lines, and lower boundary of the upper thigh (Figure 1).\n3. Fluorescent dye preparation\nIndocyanine green (ICG) preparation\n\t\nDissolve 25 mg of ICG into 20 mL of sterile water for a final concentration of 1.25 mg/mL and shake gently.\n4. ICG injection\nUse a 2 mL syringe (with the needle size of 0.6 mm x 32 mm TW LB) to inject 0.5 mL of the prepared ICG at 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock of the ectocervix at the superficial (2-3 mm) and deep (1-2 cm) cervix, respectively (Figure 2).\n\t​NOTE: In some cases, the ectocervix positions of 6 and 12 o'clock can also be selected. ICG should be avoided when injected into Nessler's cyst.\n5. Intraoperative SLN identification\nPreparation before development\n\t\nGrasp the skin around the umbilicus with two towel forceps to elevate the abdominal wall. Make an incision of about 10 mm wide in the skin of the umbilicus and through the fascia and peritoneum.\nInsert a 10 mm trocar through the umbilicus, producing the pneumoperitoneum with intraperitoneal pressure of about 13-14 mmHg. Insert a laparoscope (with light source and cameras) via the trocar.\nMake three other small incisions of ~5 mm wide in the lower abdomen and insert 5 mm trocars through the abdominal wall into the cavity. Insert instruments for manipulation via the other three 5 mm trocars (Figure 1).",
    "Identify the fallopian tubes under laparoscopy. Grasp and elevate the tubes close to fimbriae and tie a ligature around the tube with a 2-0/T silk suture.\n\t\tNOTE: This step is used to prevent endometrial tumor cells from entering the abdominal cavity along the fallopian tubes from the uterine cavity.\nTake the peritoneal washings with 100 mL of normal saline before any significant handling or manipulation of the uterus. Collect the washing fluid for cytology.\nOpen the fluorescence mode of the endoscopic fluorescence imaging system (see step 5.2). Lift unilateral pelvic infundibulum ligament and uterus to reveal the lateral peritoneum and look for the fluorescence lymphatic vessels.\n\t\t​NOTE: If there are no fluorescence lymphatic vessels identified, it is allowed to inject ICG repeatedly.\nSLN mapping\n\t\nEndoscopic fluorescence imaging system preparation (PINPOINT).\nAdjust the fluorescence mode to near-infrared laser (excitation light, 805 nm) for the best field of view.\n\t\tNOTE: The endoscopic fluorescence imaging system has several modes, such as HD (High definition) white light, SPY fluorescence, PINPOINT fluorescence, and SPY CSF mode, and the surgeon can switch to another mode if necessary.\nIdentify SLNs under a fluorescence laparoscopy.\n\t\nHold an ultrasonic scalpel and toothless forceps with each hand (performed by the surgeon).\n\t\tNOTE: The assistant grasps toothless forceps to cooperate with the surgeon.\nLift and open the peritoneum, separate the sub-peritoneal fat and connective tissues to reveal the necessary structures, including the ureter, internal iliac vessels, and obturator nerves according to the indication of green fluorescence lymphatic lines, as well as to protect them from injury.\n\t\tNOTE: An ultrasonic scalpel with activation is used to cut the tissues, while an inactivated scalpel can be used for blunt dissection.\nObserve the SLNs covered by the peritoneum about 5-10 min after ICG injection.",
    "​NOTE: Typically, SLNs present along with the fluorescence lymphatic vessels from both sides of the cervix to at least the height of the common iliac blood vessel. Occasionally, the SLNs emerge beside the abdominal aorta. PINPOINT equipment has multiple modes, including white light, fluorescence, and black and white modes. Switching between multiple modes helps to determine the location of SLNs.\n6. Intraoperative SLN biopsy\nLocate the SLN, the first mapped lymph node along the drainage from parametrium in each hemi-pelvis, and use multiple modes to confirm it. Fully expose the SLNs for complete resection (Figure 3).\nGrasp and elevate the SLN by toothless forceps and perform a complete resection of the lymph node along the periphery of the lymph node in white light.\n\tNOTE: Avoid lymph node damage, which might cause contamination with tumor cells.\nPlace the removed SLNs in the obturator fossa or put them into a small, simple bag. After the uterus is completely removed and taken out through the vagina, bilateral SLNs are taken out entirely through the vagina rather than through the 5 mm trocar opening to avoid fragmentation.\nSend the removed lymph nodes to the pathology department for pathological ultrastaging.\nDuring the operation, resect the enlarged or suspicious lymph nodes simultaneously and send them for pathological examination.\nRecord the locations of SLNs on standardized intraoperative data collection forms.\nIf SLN mapping fails on one or both sides, perform side-specific lymphadenectomy according to the NCCN guidelines.",
    "NOTE: If there is no fluorescent node in the hemipelvis, continue to seek the mapped node along the lymphatic vessels until the para-aortic region due to the possibility of mapping in unexpected locations. A failed SLN mapping on either side means that any fluorescent green node is not visible with or without fluorescent green lymphatic vessels under the fluorescence laparoscope system on either side of the pelvis and para-aortic region.\nPerform a total hysterectomy plus bilateral salpingectomy.\n\t​NOTE: Since this was a 28-year-old patient with early-stage endometrioid cancer who had a strong desire for fertility preservation and normal-appearing ovarian cancer and had no apparent family history of breast/ovarian cancer or Lynch Syndrome, ovarian preservation could be considered.\nIndwell a drainage tube for potential residual fluid in the pelvis.\nRemove the laparoscope and release the gas from the abdomen. Close the incisions in the umbilicus and lower abdomen with a single stitch by 2-0/T silk suture.\n7. Postoperative SLN ultrastaging20\nCut the SLN along the maximum diameter and micro-sectioned 50 µm apart to get three hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) slides and one immunohistochemistry (IHC) slide with anti-cytokeratin antibody (AE1/AE3).\n\tNOTE: Ultrastaging entails thin serial sectioning of the gross SLN. Cytokeratin IHC is not essential. No standard protocol is for ultrastaging.\nLymph node metastases were described as macrometastases (>2 mm), micrometastases (0.2-2.0 mm), or isolated tumor cells (ITCs) according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)21.\nReport the postoperative pathology with details about the tumor size, histologic type and grade, myometrial invasion, lymphovascular space involvement, cervical stromal involvement, number and status of per lymph nodes, and the cytology of peritoneal washings.\nSubscription Required.
