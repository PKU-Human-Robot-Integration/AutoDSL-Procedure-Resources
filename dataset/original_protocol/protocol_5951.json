    "Days -5 to -2Seed LLC-MK2 cells into the necessary number of 6-well plates (as below) to test samples and controls at all needed dilutions.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181029/20181029235816_5696.jpgNote: You want the plates with lightly confluent cells on Day 0 (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181029/20181029235536_6727.jpgFigure 1. Lightly confluent LLC-MK2 cells. Once overlaid agar is solidified, cells can no longer proliferate. Therefore, the cells want to be confluent when you overlay agar on the cells (Scale bar = 100 μm).Day 0 Set up sterile 50 ml agar solution in 100 ml glass bottle(s) to be used in Step 3fAdd 0.5 g agar to 50 ml distilled water in a 100 ml bottle. One to 4 bottles are needed.Autoclave the bottle(s) at 121 °C for 30 min.Mix the agar well when it comes out of the autoclave and hold in a 50 °C water bath until ready to use (Step 3f).Note: The final 100 ml will handle 8 six-well plates most comfortably at the same time. Up to total 4 bottles and 32 plates are practical.Viral preparationThaw the virus samples and a positive control (to be titrated) on ice, and keep them on ice.Note: For the proper analysis, a positive control (Sendai virus, VR-105 from ATCC) is required for every experiment. One vial (1 ml) from ATCC can be used for 10 to 20 experiments. The vial from ATCC should be aliquoted into 50 μl to 100 μl each (10 to 20 tubes) in the first experiment, and stored in liquid nitrogen tank. The viral titer is stable at least for three years by this method according to our experience. We recommend you use the original SeV from ATCC (not a \"homemade\" SeV stock) as a positive control because of the certainty of the viral titer.",
    "Sonicate (40 kHz frequency and 35 W ultrasonic power) the virus samples for 30 sec in a sonic water bath at room temperature before use to break and dissociate viral chunks.Make serial dilutions of virus in pure Medium 199 (without Fetal Bovine Serum, gentamicin or L-glutamine) at whole log (10-fold) dilutions or half-log (3.16-fold) dilutions in the appropriate range (Figure 2). Doing these dilutions in rack of 96 microtubes (1.2 ml volume) with a multichannel pipette will greatly increase efficiency. Keep samples and dilutions on ice.Note: \"Pure Medium 199\" means only Medium 199 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) without serum.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181029/20181029235551_4501.jpgFigure 2. Serial dilutions of viral sample. A. For whole-log dilutions, 100 μl of sample will be serially transferred to the next tube that contains 900 μl of pure Medium 199. B. For half-log dilutions, 316 μl of sample will be serially transferred to the next tube that contains 684 μl of pure Medium 199.Inoculation and incubationRinse lightly the confluent monolayers of LLC-MK2 cells on the plates with HBSS with Ca2+Mg2+: Remove old media and add 2 ml of HBSS with Ca2+Mg2+.Suction the media off the number of plates, and quickly add 200 μl of pure Medium 199 to each well.Add 200 μl of sample dilutions in duplicate or triplicate. Work from the most dilute to the least dilute to save on tip changes.Incubate plates for 90 min at 37 °C with 5% CO2.Note: Gently agitate plates about every 30 min to avoid drying out the plates. During the incubation, make up complete 2x media in 50 ml aliquots (see Recipes).At the end of the 90-min incubation, mix together the complete 2x media (at room temperature) and the 1% agar water (in a 50 °C water bath) for the first set of 8 plates, and place the mixture at room temperature.",
    "Suction viral inoculum media from the plates, and quickly add 2 ml of media with 0.5% agar (Step 3f) into each well using a 10 ml pipette (capacity of 12 ml).Cool at room temperature until the agar media solidify. Do not stack the plates.Incubate the plates (cells overlaid with the agar media) for 3 days at 37 °C with 5% CO2.Day 3: HemadsorptionWash approximately 3 ml of guinea pig blood with sterile PBS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+) 3 times in a 15 ml tube. Spin at 434 x g for 5 min to obtain about 1 ml pellet of red blood cells (RBCs).Resuspend the 1 ml of RBC pellet to 9 ml of PBS (10% volume/volume) with PBS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+).Make a 0.1% RBC suspension with PBS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+) from 10% RBC suspension.Remove 6-well plates from the incubator in small groups (like 4 plates).Shake the agar off one plate at a time with a quick snap of the wrist into a biohazard bag and immediately add 2 ml of PBS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+; at room temperature).Note: Removal of agar leaves the plate very dry and the cells are vulnerable (LLC-MK2 cells are not particularly sensitive to detachment, but this is an effect of this assay). Please add PBS immediately but gently along the wall of the wells, not directly to the cells. Remove PBS from the 6-well plates, and add 2 ml of 0.1% RBC solution to each well (Step 3).Incubate plates at room temperature for 20-30 min.Gently agitate plates to resuspend RBCs, and replaced the RBC suspension with 2 ml PBS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+).Note: This one-time wash is usually sufficient, but a second wash is acceptable. Score plaques as well-defined areas where RBCs attach (Figure 3).",
    "Note: Clean the bottom (outside) of the well with alcohol before counting. If you place the plates on a light box, you will be able to more easily identify the plaques. Calculate pfu/ml based on sample size (200 μl) and dilution.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181029/20181029235606_7739.jpgFigure 3. Sendai virus plaques. A. Five plaques in one well. B. Magnification of one plaque shows a ring-shape plaque of red blood cells attaching to LLC-MK2 cells and a central empty area where LLC-MK2 cells died and detached.An example of titer calculationIf the inoculation sample in Figure 3 is 107 dilution:Virus titer (pfu/ml) = 5 (plaques)/[0.2 ml (inoculation volume) x 107 (sample dilution)] = 2.5 x 108 PFU/ml"
