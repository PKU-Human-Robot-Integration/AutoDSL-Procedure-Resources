  "procedures": [
    "All procedures were done according to local animal welfare laws and guidelines.\n1. Preparation of Instruments, Culture Media, and Dishes\nAutoclave 1 set of intestinal scissors, normal scissors, and forceps in a sterile container.\nPlace a 96-well (flat bottom) dish in an incubator at 37 °C.\nPrepare 10 mL of complete culture medium with the reagents listed in table of materials.\nIncubate the complete medium at 37 °C in a water bath.\nThaw reconstituted basement membrane by placing it in an ice bucket. The reconstituted basement membrane will become liquid at 4 °C .\nFill 4 Petri dishes with cold phosphate-buffered saline or abbreviated PBS (4 °C).\n2. Isolation of Small Intestinal Crypts\nSacrifice by CO2 inhalation a Lgr5-eGFP-IRES-CreERt2 mouse on a C57BL6/J background. Dissect the peritoneum longitudinally with a pair of scissors.\nHold the stomach with the forceps and cut it transversally in half.\nUsing the intestinal scissors from now on, pull out the intestine and place it in a Petri dish containing PBS.\n\tNOTE: Intestinal scissors have a sharp and a blunt tip. The blunt tip of these scissors is meant to not damage the crypt-villus architecture while opening the intestine.\nStart by placing the blunt tip into the stomach and gently push it through the pylorus. Proceed by cutting with the scissors and pulling with the forceps.\nOnce the whole small intestine is opened longitudinally, wash it in cold PBS by holding it with the forceps and gently rinse it in the PBS solution with U-shaped movements.\nOnce all the stool remnants are cleared, proceed to flatten the intestine on a cutting board, luminal side up. The luminal side is easily recognizable by the absence of blood vessels and by its pale appearance when compared with the outer part.",
    "With a glass slide, gently remove the villi by scraping the flattened intestine. Perform this step twice along the whole length of the tissue.\nCut the small intestine with a sterile surgical blade into 2 - 5 mm pieces.\nPlace the small intestinal fragments in a 50 mL tube containing 10 mL of ice cold PBS.\nClean the tissue fragments, removing any remaining impurities by pipetting them up and down in the PBS. Discard supernatant and repeat this step until the PBS is completely clear.\nAdd 15 mL cold PBS, to bring the total final volume of PBS to 25 mL. Add 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and incubate for 45 min on a roller at 4 °C.\nDiscard the PBS/EDTA.\nAdd 10 mL of PBS and detach the crypts by harshly pipetting the tissue fragments up and down (at least three times). Collect the supernatant.\nRepeat step 2.13 four times. Add culture medium to reach a final volume of 50 mL.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation (300 x g for 5 min).\nResuspend the pellet in 10 mL of culture medium and pellet the crypts by centrifugation (80 x g for 3 min).\n3. Single Cell Preparation\nDiscard the supernatant of the pelleted crypts and resuspend them in 1 mL trypsin like-enzymes together with 50 µL DNAse (50 µg/mL).\nIncubate the cells in a water bath at 32 °C for 2 min.\nAdd 10 mL of culture medium. Dissociate the crypts into single cells by harshly pipetting up and down at least 5 times.\nFilter the solution through a 40 µm strainer (to eliminate clumps and other impurities) and pellet the single cells at 300 x g for 5 min.\n4. Flow Cytometry and Plating",
    "Prepare 50 mL of 1x Hank's buffered salt solution or HBSS/2% fetal cow serum (FCS) solution and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL for every 106 cells\nAdd to the cell suspension BV421 Lin- (CD31, CD45, TER119) at a concentration of 1:100, and CD24-APC and CD117-PE both at a concentration of 1:250 antibodies for 30 min.\nSort Lgr5+ stem cells and Paneth cells into separate low bind tubes. For details on sorting protocols for Lgr5+ and Paneth cells, please see Roth et al.7 and Schewe et al.6\nCentrifuge the sorted cells at 300 x g for 5 min. Resuspend the cells in 100 µL medium with the components described as in 1.3 (see the Table of Materials).\nTreat (e.g., by chemical or genetic modification) the Paneth cells (n = 2000) or the Lgr5+ stem cells (n = 2000).\n\t\nTo treat cells, use 5 µL of liposome-mediated transfection reagent in a total volume of 100 µL culture medium and small interfering RNA (siRNA) at a concentration of 100 nM. Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C for siRNA or for the time necessary for the chosen modification.\nWash the cells twice in 500 µL culture medium.\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min and resuspend the cells in 10 µL culture medium.\nPool the two cellular components (Paneth or Lgr5+ cells) in a 20 µl total volume and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at RT.\nCo-incubate the Paneth and Lgr5+ cells for 10 min at RT.\nRemove 10 µL of the supernatant and leave a meniscus of liquid to be sure to not aspirate the cell pellet.",
    "Add 30 µL of reconstituted basement membrane to the cells for a total volume of 40 µL, resuspend the cells and plate in a pre-warmed 96 well plate. After 10 min, add 200 µL of complete medium (see the Table of Materials). Change medium every 48 h.\nCount organoid multiplicity at day 5.\nSubscription Required.
