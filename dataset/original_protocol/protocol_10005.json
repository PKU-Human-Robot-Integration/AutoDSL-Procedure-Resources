    "The administration of these experiments followed all research ethics regulations. All subjects provided informed verbal and written consent before the experiments were administered. All the procedures, consent forms, and the experimental protocol were approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan.\n1. Experiment 1―dual-modal intrasentential interference task\nRecruit 97 students, 54 females and 42 males, from the National Tainan Institute of Nursing and the National Tainan Secondary High School to participate in Experiment 1.\n\tNOTE: All participants are required to be fluent native Chinese speakers with normal or corrected-to-normal vision and no auditory impairment by self-report.\nMaterial preparation\n\t\nSelect words and nonwords for the LDT. Include a total of 48 bisyllabic (two-character) Chinese words, of which 24 were words and 24 were nonwords.\n\t\tNOTE: A Chinese character represents a syllable, which is usually a morpheme (i.e., the smallest meaningful element). The target words here are bisyllabic compound words. Please see the Supplemental File for a list of the visual target words/nonwords used for the LDT task.\n\t\t\nSelect the 24 words from the Sinica Corpus Technical Report18, while ensure that all of the target words are of medium frequency. Search words of the mean frequency percentage approximately 0.00030 and the ranking order approximately 4,000 in the database.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Choosing words of medium frequency as the target words is intended to reduce the frequency effect, which results in shorter response times (RTs) for high-frequency words and longer RTs from low-frequency words.",
    "Create the 24 nonwords by using two monosyllabic characters that are individually meaningful but whose combination is semantically anomalous. To prevent potential activations, avoid bisyllabic-character words with identical radicals (e.g., haiyang, meaning ‘ocean’, is represented in a Chinese bisyllabic character word as imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59660/59660char01.jpg, where the radical component  imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59660/59660char03.jpg related to waters is shared in the characters imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59660/59660char02.jpg and imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59660/59660char04.jpg).\nCollocate manually the 24 nonwords in filler sentences and the 24 words in target RC sentences.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Collocating words with RCs and nonwords with fillers was necessary because only the RTs of LDT from the 24 words with RCs should be considered and included in the statistical analyses.\nAuditory RC and filler sentences\n\t\tNOTE: Please see the Supplemental File for examples of the SRC, ORC, and filler sentences.\n\t\t\nCompose the auditory stimuli into 72 sentences, involving three types of sentences: 24 SRCs, 24 ORCs, and 24 filler sentences.\nDivide the 48 RC sentences evenly into two groups to create an incomplete-counterbalanced design, forming 48 trials (12 SRCs, 12 ORCs, and 24 fillers) in the 2 (SRC, ORC) * 3 (probing site) * 2 (word/nonword) conditions.\nSetting up the experimental software\n\t\nUse a standard experimental software (i.e., E-Prime19) to program the experiment according to the software protocols.\nRandomize all the stimuli using the experimental software.\nConfigure the software system to record the following data: (1) the response time, (2) the accuracy rate of the participant’s responses in the LDT, and (3) the postsentence comprehension based on the participants’ keyboard presses.\nInclude feedback regarding participants’ incorrect lexical decision or no response. Display feedback on the monitor screen immediately after the participant's incorrect or missing response. No feedback is shown when the participant’s response was correct.\nProvide a practice section involving trials with feedback.",
    "After the practice session, start the dual-modal intrasentential LDT interference task. During the experimental sessions, allow the participants to take a break between every 24 trials.\n\t\nHave each participant perform the task individually. First, provide the participants with instructions both in written form on the computer screen and in verbal form by the experimenter. Seat the participants in front of a computer and equip them with headphones.\nInstruct the participants to listen to the sentences played through their headphones, while simultaneously, at some point during the listening process, to perform a lexical decision task.\nAsk the participants to decide whether the interfering visual probe displayed on the screen was a word or nonword and instruct them to press the response key ‘Yes’ for a word or ‘No’ for a nonword as quickly and accurately as possible.\nInform the participants that a comprehension question would follow immediately after the sentence. Remind them to listen attentively to the auditory sentence while simultaneously perform the LDT task.\n2. Experiment 2―dual-modal extrasentential interference task\nRecruit 61 college students, 40 females and 21 males, from the National Taipei University of Technology and the National Tainan Junior College of Nursing as participants in Experiment 2.\n\tNOTE: All the participants are required to be fluent native Chinese speakers with normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity and no auditory impairment by self-report.\nMaterial preparation\n\t\nAuditory RC and filler sentences\n\t\t\nCompose the auditory stimuli into three types of sentences: SRCs, ORCs, and filler sentences. Divide the 48 RC sentences evenly into two groups to create an incomplete counterbalanced design with 96 total trials (24 SRCs, 24 ORCs, and 48 fillers) for the 2 (sentence type: SRC, ORC) * 3 (digit load) conditions.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Please see the Supplemental File for target auditory trial examples of the SRC, ORC, and filler sentences.",
    "0/3/5 digits\n\t\t\nConstruct a total of 96 digital items, comprised of 0/3/5 digit combinations. Assign each 0, 3, or 5 digit load evenly to all the sentence trials.\nDual modal extrasentential digital interference task with AMW paradigm\n\t\nUse a standard experimental software (i.e., E-Prime19) to program the experiment according to the software protocols.\nRandomly assign the participants to one of the two stimuli sets representing combinations of two within-subject factors of sentence type (SRC vs. ORC) and memory load (no load, 3-digit- load, 5-digit-load).Provide the participants with the 1,500 ms visual presentation of the digits before the AMW task.\nThen, start the AMW task.\n\tNOTE: The AMW task20 is a self-paced listening task.\n\t\nInstruct the participants to keep the preceding visual presentation (digits or no digits) in memory.\nThen, instruct the participants to listen to the sentences segmented into words and played through their headphones. Tell them to pace themselves as quickly as possible by pressing the keyboard to initiate playing of the subsequent segmented word.\nInstruct the participants to answer the yes/no comprehension question that appeared on the computer screen after they have listened to each trial sentence. Inform the participants that the question is preceded by a question mark “?” on the computer screen and that the question is related to the information they have heard in the preceding sentence.\nA short “beep” sound is played when the participants press the yes/no key to answer the comprehension question. After the beep, following the instruction appearing on the screen, ask the participants to repeat the digit they have seen prior to listening to the sentence.\nHave the experimenter to record the participants’ digit-recall responses on a score sheet.\nSubscription Required.
