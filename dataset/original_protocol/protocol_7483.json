    "TP-PCR master mix preparation for amplification and melting curve analysis of the ATXN1, ATXN2, and ATXN3 CAG repeat loci  This protocol outlines the steps to perform TP-PCR amplification of the ATXN1, ATXN2, and ATXN3 CAG repeats and melting curve analysis (MCA) of the generated TP-PCR products. Each TP-PCR assay utilizes a plasmid control DNA [pATXN1(CAG)35(14+1+18), pATXN2(CAG)25(15+9), and pATXN3(CAG)41 in SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3 TP-PCR MCAs, respectively], to generate threshold melt peak temperature (Tm), which is used to classify test samples as expansion-negative (if Tm is lower than the plasmid control’s Tm) or potentially expansion-positive (if Tm is higher than the plasmid control’s Tm).Prepare the TP-PCR master mix by dispensing the following reagents into a microcentrifuge tube (volumes stated are for a single reaction):9.60 μL of HPLC water7.50 μL of 5× Q-solution2.50 μL of 10× HotStarTaq PCR buffer0.25 μL of 10× SYBRTM Green I Nucleic Acid Gel Stain1.25 μL of 10 μM ATXN1-specific forward primer (SCA1-F), ATXN2-specific forward primer (SCA2-F), or ATXN3-specific forward primer (SCA3-F)1.25 μL of 10 μM Tail primer1.25 μL of 1 μM ATXN1-specific TP primer (SCA1-TP), ATXN2-specific TP primer (SCA2-TP), or ATXN3-specific TP primer (SCA3-TP)0.20 μL of 25 mM dNTPs0.20 μL of HotStarTaq DNA polymeraseVortex to mix and spin the tube briefly.Aliquot 24 μL of the master mix into the MicroAmpTM Fast 8-tube strip tubes.Add 1 μL of test sample genomic DNA (10 ng/μL) or relevant plasmid DNA [1 pg/μL pATXN1(CAG)35(14+1+18) and pATXN2(CAG)25(15+9) for SCA1 and SCA2 TP-PCR MCAs, respectively, and 10 pg/μL pATXN3(CAG)41 for SCA3 TP-PCR MCA] into the appropriate tubes. To the non-template control tube, add 1 μL of HPLC water.Apply the MicroAmpTM Optical 8-cap strip. Sample labeling can be done on the edge instead of in the middle of the cap to avoid blocking of light to the reaction tubes.Spin the tubes briefly.",
