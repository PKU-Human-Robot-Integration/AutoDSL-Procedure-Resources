    "Ethics Statement: All studies described were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the Thomas Jefferson University and Indiana University School of Medicine.\n1. C26 Cell Growth and Preparation\nObtain C26 colorectal cancer cells (Ohio State University Medical Center (OSUMC)) and prepare complete growth medium (i.e., high-glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1% glutamine, and 1% streptomycin/penicillin).\n\tNOTE: In order to allow better inter-experimental reproducibility, it is preferable to use C26 cells at a passage as low as possible.\nUse a commercially available cell counter to plate 50,000 cells/cm2 in flasks with complete growth medium. Incubate them in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until sub-confluent. Avoid culturing them at high density to prevent differentiation and drifting of cell phenotypes.\nAfter the first passage, plate enough cells to be implanted in the planned number of animals. On the day of cell implantation, dissociate the cells by trypsinization with 0.02 ml of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution per cm2, neutralize the trypsin by adding at least 3 ml of fresh medium per ml of trypsin, determine cell concentration in cells/ml, and resuspend the number of cells needed for the experiment (1 x 106 cells per mouse) in sterile PBS.\n\tNOTE: C26 cells reach confluency when the density is about 500,000 cells/cm2.\n2. Mice\nRandomize adult CD2F1 mice (at least 8 weeks of age) into groups (usually controls and tumor-bearers) with at least n = 6 per group.",
    "NOTE: C26 tumors grow in Balb/c mice as well. However, based on our experience, CD2F1 mice represent a more versatile and economic host for this particular tumor model. Moreover, similar to the clinical settings and to findings reported in other experimental models of cancer-associated muscle wasting14-16, sex differences in the response to C26 cachexia may also be observed17 (see also Table 1).\nAnesthetize the mouse using isoflurane by inhalation (3% in oxygen). Maintain the animal under anesthesia exclusively for the time necessary to perform the tumor inoculation. Make sure the mouse lies on a heated pad in order to prevent the loss of body heat. Before starting the tumor injection procedure, confirm proper anesthetization by gently pinching the rear toes.\n\tNOTE: Due to the duration of this procedure (generally a few seconds), the use of veterinary eye ointment is not required. For the same reason, control animals undergoing the sham operation are not expected to lose weight.\nUsing a sterile 1-ml insulin syringe with a 26-gauge needle, quickly inject 250 μl of the solution containing the tumor cells subcutaneously and intrascapularly in the fat pad of the mouse.\n\tNOTE: The control animals will receive 250 µl of sterile saline solution intrascapularly in the fat pad.\nPlace the animal back in its cage. Directly observe the mouse at least once every 15 min until it can respond to gentle manipulation and has regained a righting reflex.",
    "NOTE: Do not leave the mouse unattended, and keep it in a warm recovery cage that contains a solid substrate. Furthermore, do not return the mouse to the animal room until it is fully recovered from anesthesia. Generally, mice do not need to be individually housed unless the investigator aims to assess individual food intake. If this is the case and the use of automated metabolic cages is not available, manual recording of food consumption must be performed, possibly daily and at the same time each day.\nCheck the mice daily and record their body weights.\n\tNOTE: Recording the body condition score and home cage behaviors can differentiate degrees of cachexia and sickness behavior, which is useful for treatment studies18.\n3. Euthanasia and Blood Collection\nWhen body weight loss in the tumor hosts versus controls reaches 5%, 10%, or 15% (mild, moderate, and severe cachexia, respectively) compared to their initial body weights, euthanize the mice.\n\tNOTE: A typical experiment will be carried out until one group reaches 10% weight loss, upon which time all groups are euthanized. Body weight loss is assessed by measuring the body weight inclusive of the tumor.\nPlace the mouse under isoflurane general anesthesia (3% in oxygen). Draw blood by means of a cardiac puncture (approximately 1 - 1.5 ml).\nCollect the blood in K2-EDTA (18 mg) empty tubes and place them on ice. Centrifuge the blood (2,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C) and collect the plasma/serum.\nEuthanize the mouse by means of cervical dislocation. Proceed to tissue excision and organ collection.\n4. Tissue and Organ Excision\nNOTE: For use of tissues in biochemical or molecular biology assays, plan to weigh each organ and tissue and place a fragment immediately into pre-labeled cryotubes. Snap freeze in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C.",
    "In order to avoid contamination of tissue samples with fur, spray 70% ethanol over the entire body.\nPlace the mouse on a dissection bed in a supine position and extend a limb vertically by attaching the foot to an elevated buret clamp.\nGrasp the skin of the lower limb with Dumont forceps and use the curved fine scissors to gently remove the skin and fascia, exposing the underlying muscle bellies of the lower limb.\nIdentify the gastrocnemius muscle on the posterior lower limb by its origin at the lateral and medial condyles on the posterior femur and its insertion at the calcaneus via the calcaneal tendon.\n\t\nProceed to cut the gastrocnemius calcaneal tendon. Grasp the distal end of the gastrocnemius with Dumont forceps and pull the muscle belly toward its origin. Using scissors, cut the muscle at the origin as close as possible to the femur. Place the muscle in a dish. Weigh it immediately and freeze it in a tube in liquid nitrogen.\n\t\tNOTE: Be sure not to excise the soleus muscle along with the gastrocnemius. If that occurs, carefully remove soleus by gently pulling it off with the forceps.\nProceed to identify and excise the tibialis anterior muscle from its origin at the anterolateral surface of the tibia and its insertion at the medial cuneiform via its distal tendon.\n\t\nIn order to have leverage, hold the foot by grasping the digits with the index finger and thumb. Insert the tip of Dumont forceps immediately under the superficial distal tendon of the tibialis and move the forceps such that the blunt side can be used to detach the tibialis muscle belly from the underlying connective tissue.",
    "Cut the distal tendon using the fine curved scissors, and then cut the muscle at the origin, as close as possible to the tibia.\nOpen the abdominal cavity by performing a sagittal incision starting in the hypogastric region and moving superiorly to the epigastric region, stopping the incision just above the diaphragm.\n\tNOTE: The depth of the incision should only be enough to breach the abdominal muscle wall and the underlying peritoneal fascia.\nCarefully remove the liver by grasping it with the blunt-tipped forceps, and use the fine curved scissors to dissect away any blood vessels or connective tissue that adhere the liver to the cavity. Take care not to leave any lobes behind. Weigh and snap freeze the liver in a tube in liquid nitrogen.\nUsing the blunt-tipped forceps, move away the intestine, and then expose and delicately remove the spleen. Grasp the spleen gently with the blunt-tipped forceps and use the back or blunt side of the fine curved scissors to dissect away any connective tissue or blood vessels adhering the spleen to the cavity. Weigh and snap freeze it in a tube in liquid nitrogen.\nIdentify the gonadal fat pads, adjacent to the epididymis (in males) or uterus (in females). Gently grasp the epididymal fat pad with the blunt-tipped forceps and pull the tissue out of the cavity. Using the fine curved scissors, cut away any gonadal tissue that may be attached to the fat pad. Weigh the fat pad and snap freeze it in a tube in liquid nitrogen.\n\tNOTE: Generally, this adipose tissue is considered representative of the overall body fat mass in mice and declines in weight with cachexia. Other fat pads can be similarly identified, dissected, removed, and weighed.",
    "Use the curved fine scissors to open the chest of the animal. Cut away the ribs attached to both lateral borders of the sternum. Remove the sternum. Using two pairs of forceps, grasp each side of the rib cage and pull each side laterally to open the thoracic cavity.\nDelicately pull the heart with the forceps. Carefully excise the heart with the curved fine scissors by severing the aorta at the left atrium. Make sure to empty the organ of any residual blood by delicately blotting it against some absorbent paper. Weigh and snap freeze it in a tube in liquid nitrogen.\n5. Muscle Freezing and Mounting\nImmerse the bottom half of a small plastic beaker (50 ml) containing isopentane into liquid nitrogen. The isopentane is ready to use when it becomes slightly viscous and forms a solid white laminate lining the inside of the beaker (temperature: -160 °C).\n\tNOTE: Always use non­sparking bronze or aluminum hand tools. Avoid breathing product vapor. Use with adequate ventilation. If dealing with a spill and ventilation is impossible or impractical, wear a suitable respirator.\nFreeze some embedding medium on a chuck (cork) by dipping it briefly (10 sec) into isopentane.\nHandle the muscle (e.g., the tibialis or gastrocnemius) by holding it by the tendon, vertically relative to the cork, in order to maintain the orientation of the fibers and to allow for cross sections.\nCarefully position the end portion of the fresh muscle on top of the frozen embedding medium.\n\tNOTE: The muscle will stick. It is important NOT to completely surround the muscle with embedding medium. It is also important to maintain the vertical orientation for subsequent determination of the cross-sectional area.",
    "Dip the chuck with the attached muscle into the isopentane bath (the usual freezing time is 7 - 15 sec, depending on the specimen size and composition).\n\tNOTE: Immersion in the freezing solution should not last more than is needed to completely freeze the specimen. Freezing too long will fracture the tissue block, while too short a time will cause ice crystal formation. A well-frozen specimen will be chalky white.\nAfter freezing the specimen, place it into a small plastic bag or specimen tube (50 ml) and immediately store it in a deep freezer at -80 °C or in liquid nitrogen.\n6. Analysis of the Raw Data\nIn order to control for variations in size of the mice, normalize the final body weight (FBW); tumor-free body weight; and carcass, organ, and tissue weight (expressed in grams) according to the initial body weight (IBW), and express them as \"weight/100 mg IBW\".\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, some investigators normalize the muscle mass to the tibia length.\nUse a software for data analysis. Find the mean and SD of the normalized weights. Perform statistical analysis with unpaired Student's t-tests between controls and C26-bearing mice.\n\tNOTE: Results can be presented relative to body (IBW and tumor-free FBW), tumor, organ, and tissue weights.\n7. Muscle Sectioning\nSet the working temperature of the cryostat inner chamber to around -23 °C.\nAllow the specimen (previously stored at -80 °C) to acclimatize at the working temperature (a couple of hours should be enough).\nCut multiple 8-μm thick sections of the specimen (preferably the tibialis anterior or gastrocnemius muscles) and collect them on glass slides.\n\tNOTE: Cut the section at the mid-belly region of the muscle. Also, for the sake of accuracy, cut the sections perpendicularly to the mounting axis.",
    "Keep the glass slides inside the cryostat chamber. Do not let them thaw if the aim is to perform IF/IHC studies or enzymatic staining.\nStore the slides at -80 °C for further analyses.\n8. Evaluation of Myofiber Size by Laminin Immunofluorescence (Alternative 1)\nNOTE: For the evaluation of muscle morphology and cross-sectional area (CSA), hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)- as well as immunofluorescence (IF)-based staining methods are accepted systems to determine fiber size19. Although the H&E staining of muscle sections represents a valuable and convenient method for the analysis of morphology, the use of an IF approach14 is significantly faster and modestly more accurate than the H&E-based method. H&E methods are described below.\nRemove tissue sections from either the cryostat or the -80 °C storage and allow them to equilibrate to room temperature (approximately 5 - 10 min).\n\tNOTE: In order to avoid non-specific interactions associated with primary antibodies raised in mice, it is advisable to either use antibodies raised in another species or to make use of commercially available \"mouse-on-mouse\" immunodetection kits.\nImmerse the sections in pre-cooled methanol (-20 °C) for 10 min.\nWash the sections in room temperature 1x PBS for 5 min.\nRemove the PBS and use a pen for immunohistochemical applications to encircle the sections on the slide. Do NOT let sections completely dry at any point.\nApply a suitable blocking buffer (5 - 8% FBS in PBS or 5% goat serum in PBS) onto the sections for 1 hr at RT.\nRemove the blocking buffer.\nApply either a rabbit anti-laminin (1:30) or a mouse anti-dystrophin (1:30) primary antibody in blocking buffer to the sections for 2 hr at RT (or overnight at 4 °C) in a humid chamber.\nWash the sections with 1x PBS for 5 min.",
    "Remove the wash buffer and wash sections again in 1x PBS for 5 min.\nRemove the wash buffer and apply a proper fluorescent secondary antibody (1:1,000 in blocking buffer) to the sections in a humid chamber for 1 hr at RT.\nRemove the secondary antibody and wash the sections with 1x PBS for 5 min.\nRemove the wash buffer and repeat the wash with 1x PBS for 5 min. Remove the wash buffer and cover the sections with a cover glass using an aqueous-based medium.\nIdentify the morphological features of the muscle by using digital images of the stained section. In order to do so, use an inverted fluorescent light microscope for IF sections (a 10X or 20X magnification objective is appropriate), along with a digital camera and image capture software. Place a scale bar in each digital image (20 - 30 random fields are recommended for each muscle section) to facilitate the quantification of the CSA. Images should be saved in .TIF format to be compatible with the image analysis software using the ImageJ program.\nUse an ImageJ macro to distinguish connective tissue from contractile tissue (myofiber size) through the presence of the fluorescent secondary antibody in the endomysium20.\n\tNOTE: The macro and instructions are available from the authors, Richard Lieber and Shannon Bremner.\nOpen the ImageJ program by double-clicking the icon on the desktop.\nLoad the CSA macro by clicking once the \"Plugins\" tab. Move the cursor down to select the \"Install\" option by clicking it once.\nLoad the cross-sectional macro by selecting it from the folder it has been saved in, and then click \"Open\".\nOnce the macro has been opened, open the histological image containing the scale bar by clicking \"File\" and then \"Open\" from the ImageJ toolbar.",
    "Once the image is opened, select the \"straight line tool\" in the ImageJ program by clicking on the icon with the straight line.\nOnce the \"Straight line tool\" is selected, click once on the left-most end of the scale bar and then click once on the right-most end of the scale bar. When done correctly, there should be a yellow line overlaid on the scale bar.\nMaking sure that the yellow line is still overlaid on the scale bar, select the \"Analyze\" tab from the ImageJ toolbar by clicking it once.\nIn the \"Analyze\" tab, move the cursor down and select \"set scale\" by clicking it once.\nIn the \"Set scale\" window, DO NOT change the value in the \"Distance in pixels\" box. Enter the known distance of the scale bar in the \"Known distance\" box. Change the units in the \"Unit of length\" box to correspond with the scale bar units (i.e., micrometers = µm). Finally, select \"global\" by clicking the box to the left of \"Global\" once.\nClose the \"Set scale\" window.\nOpen the first image to be measured by pressing the \"O\" button on the keyboard. Observe a window pop-up that allows the user to find and select the image to be measured from the folder it has been saved in. Select the image by clicking on it once and then clicking \"Open.\"\nOnce opened, a window should appear for the selection of the acceptable range for CSA measurements and for circularity.\n\tNOTE: These settings are usually left to their default values. However, if one wishes to change these settings, be sure to keep the values the same for each consecutive image to be measured in the experiment.",
    "After setting the CSA range and circularity, observe the image covered in red pixels with a \"Threshold\" window. Adjust the threshold of the image using the bars in the \"Threshold\" window until the muscle fibers are accurately filled in with red pixels.\n\tNOTE: Attempt to obtain the greatest number of fibers that are not touching one another; if fibers are touching, they will be measured as one large fiber, which will need to be edited downstream.\nAfter setting the threshold, press the \"1\" button on the keyboard to measure the muscle fibers.\nCircle the individual muscle fibers with a yellow line. Move through the image and remove artifacts or double fibers that have been selected by the program. To do this, select the structures that are not fibers by clicking them once, and then press the \"D\" button on the keyboard. This will delete them from the measurements.\nSelect and copy the measurements from the \"Measurement value window,\" and paste them into a spreadsheet for further analysis.\n\tNOTE: The values obtained can also be used to assess the fiber distribution analysis, which generally represents a useful parameter to determine whether tumor growth promotes a shift towards smaller muscle fibers.\nClose all of the open windows in ImageJ by clicking the \"X\" in the top-left corner of the windows.\nOpen a new image to be measured by pressing \"O\" and repeating steps 8.24 - 8.29.\n9. Evaluation of Myofiber Size from H&E Stained Sections (Alternative 2)\nPlace the glass slides into Coplin jars containing filtered Harris hematoxylin for 8 min.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, Mayer hematoxylin can be used if a less intense stain is desired.\nRinse the slides in deionized water.\nDip the slides in tap water for up to 5 min.",
    "Quickly rinse them in deionized water, and then incubate them in filtered 1% eosin solution for less than 2 min.\n\tNOTE: If a more intense stain is desired, add 1 - 2 drops of acetic acid (0.01% or less) to the eosin solution.\nBegin the dehydration steps. Rinse the slides in 70% ethanol for less than 1 min.\nDip the slides in 90% ethanol for 1 min.\nDip the slides in 95% ethanol for 1 min.\nDip the slides in 100% ethanol for 2 min.\nDip the slides in xylene for 2 min. Move the slides to another Copley jar containing fresh xylene for 2 more min.\n\tNOTE: Keep the slides in Xylene (no longer than 1 hr) until they are coverslipped.\nPlace the coverslips on the muscle sections using Permount or a Xylene-based mounting medium of choice.\nObserve the H&E-stained glass slides under a microscope with a 20X magnification, and acquire pictures of the entire muscle section area. Obtain images by using a bright-light microscope, digital camera, and image capture software.\n\tNOTE: The presence of a scale bar or image of a micrometer taken at the same magnification will be required to determine the CSA. As above, record at least 20 - 30 random fields for each muscle section.\nEvaluate the myofiber size using ImageJ software. Open every digital image. Set the scale as above. Measure at least 1,500-2,000 muscle fibers per muscle using the freehand selection tool, tracing the fiber circumference with a mouse or, for faster input, with a tablet input device and pen.\n10. Data Collection and Analysis",
    "In order to establish muscle fiber size, assess the average fiber \"area.\" Calculate means and SD for the measurements obtained for each muscle, including both the area and Feret's diameter. In addition, in order to evaluate whether the experimental setting is associated with a shift towards either smaller or larger muscle fibers, analyze the \"fiber distribution.\"\nEvaluate the significance of the result by performing an unpaired T-test for two groups. Determine the ratios between the values obtained for the C26 mice group and for the control group. Plot the values on a graph reporting the means SD and the frequency distribution/histogram aimed at demonstrating the shift in fiber sizes.\nSubscription Required.
