    "Note: All solutions should be chilled to 4 °C and all steps performed at 4 °C to reduce enzyme activity and preserve sample integrity. Prepare 2.8 M and 2.1 M sucrose solutions (see Recipes) and buffers.Note: It is easiest to prepare the sucrose gradient if 8 ml of the 2.8 M sucrose solution is added to the bottom of the 30 ml ultracentrifuge tubes before it is chilled to 4 °C.Prepare dissection equipment by washing thoroughly with ethanol.Dissect gastrocnemius and rectus femoris muscles from mouse (Figure 1 and Videos 1 and 2) and place up to 4 muscles in a 10 ml round bottom tube. Notes:  The soleus often adheres to the gastrocnemius during dissection. Remove the soleus from the gastrocnemius before proceeding to process the gastrocnemius. The rectus femoris is one of four muscles that make up the quadriceps. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171214/20171214171855_5433.jpgFigure 1. Muscle dissection. 1. Starting with the mouse lying on its ventral side, use hemostats to retract skin from ankle to hip. 2. Remove the fat pad over the back of the knee. 3. Insert scissors behind Achilles tendon. 4. Open scissors to separate gastrocnemius muscle from underlying tissue. 5. Cut Achilles tendon and the head of the gastrocnemius. If the soleus is still attached to the gastrocnemius, remove it. 6. Turn the mouse over so it is lying on its back. 7. Remove the fat pad over the hip. 8. With scissors parallel to the femur cut the tendon connecting the rectus femoris to the acetabulum (knee) and continue lengthwise to the hip. Finally, with scissors perpendicular to the femur cut the tendon connecting the muscle to the iliac spine and collect the rectus femoris muscle.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1.

Rectus femoris dissection.",
    "As shown pictorially in Figure 1 steps 6-8, this video demonstrates rectus femoris dissection.Mince muscles with scissors.Add 5 ml of chilled homogenization buffer (see Recipes) for 1-2 muscles or 10 ml of chilled homogenization buffer for 3-4 muscles to the minced muscles.Homogenize muscles with Dounce homogenizer on ice about 50 strokes (until all large chunks of muscle have been forced from the bottom of the homogenizer to the top of the plunger) (Figure 2).Notes: Warning: a vacuum may form between the plunger and the surface of the homogenization buffer. If the plunger rapidly collides the buffer, this can shatter the homogenizer.If you are pooling homogenate from more than 4 muscles, homogenize them separately and then pool the homogenate prior to Step 7. Aged or regenerating muscle samples may take longer to homogenize.Homogenizer and dissection equipment should be cleaned with ethanol and water. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171214/20171214172110_1023.jpgFigure 2. Pre-ultracentrifugation preparation. 1. Using scissors mince collected muscles in the tube. Intact muscles are shown on the left and minced muscles on the right. 2. Suspend the minced muscles in 10 ml homogenization buffer. 3. Homogenize muscle using a Dounce homogenizer. 4. Pass homogenate through a 40 µm filter into a 50 ml conical tube. Incompletely disrupted tissue and large debris will remain in the filter. 5. Centrifuge the filtrate to obtain a crude nuclear pellet (arrowhead). DAPI clearly labels the nuclear pellet under UV light. Warning: when homogenizing a vacuum may form between the pestle and homogenate. If the pestle is sucked down into the homogenizer, it can strike with sufficient force to shatter the homogenizer.Rinse a 40 µm filter with 1-2 ml of homogenization buffer. Pass the homogenate over this filter into a 50 ml conical. Note: Fibrous material that cannot pass through the filter may clog the filter.",
    "Gently scrape the filter with a round ended microspatula to help the filtrate pass through.Rinse the filter with 5 ml homogenization buffer.Centrifuge the filtrate at 1,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C to obtain a crude nuclear pellet.During the centrifugation, carefully layer 12 ml of the 2.1 M sucrose solution over the 2.8 M sucrose cushion in the 30 ml ultracentrifuge tube.After the centrifugation is completed, discard the cytoplasmic supernatant and resuspend the crude nuclear pellet in 8 ml homogenization buffer. Carefully layer the resuspended lysate on the top of the sucrose gradient. Notes:  If DAPI is added at a final concentration of 1 µg/ml to the homogenate at this step, the position of the nuclei in the sucrose gradient can be visualized. The cytoplasmic fraction can be saved for subsequent biochemical or proteomic analysis. If used immediately, the cytoplasmic fraction should be kept on ice. For longer term storage the cytoplasmic fraction should be aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. Balance the ultracentrifuge tubes by weight. Centrifuge the samples at 186,712 max G (32,000 rpm in SW 32 Ti Beckman swing bucket rotor) for 200 min at 4 °C.During the centrifugation, coat a 50 ml conical tube with BSA by incubating it with 20 ml 1% BSA resuspension buffer (see Recipes) for at least 30 min at 4 °C with low speed rocking on a standard laboratory rocker.Note: Removing the top of a glove box allows the tubes to roll on the rocker resulting in even BSA coating of up to 6 tubes (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171214/20171214172408_2512.jpgFigure 3. Loading ultracentrifuge tubes. Before beginning the protocol, 2.8 M sucrose should be layered into the bottom of the ultracentrifuge tube and chilled. During 1,000 x g centrifugation step of the muscle homogenate, layer chilled 2.",
    "1 M sucrose solution over the 2.8 M solution. When the centrifugation of the muscle homogenate is completed, resuspend the crude nuclear pellet in homogenization buffer and carefully layer it over the 2.1 M solution. DAPI labels the nuclei in the lysate. During the ultracentrifugation step coat 50 ml conical tubes with BSA, which is simplified by allowing the tubes to roll in a box on the rocker.After the ultracentrifugation is complete, aspirate the upper layers of the sucrose gradient to within a centimeter of the 2.1 M and 2.8 M boundary. Collect the 2.1 M/2.8 M interface into the BSA-coated 50 ml conical tubes using glass Pasteur pipettes (Figure 4 steps 1-4).Notes:  If the overlying layers have been correctly removed, there is little danger of contaminating the nuclear fraction with material from another interface. Thus collecting 1 cm above and 1 cm below the interface will increase the yield of nuclei without endangering the purity of the fraction.  If DAPI has been added to the homogenate, the position of the nuclei in the gradient can be visualized with UV light. DAPI fluorescence under UV light can be used to confirm that the entire interface containing the nuclei has been collected (Figure 4 step 4). Nuclei can be collected by puncturing the side of the ultracentrifugation tube with a 20-gauge needle and 10 ml syringe. However, nuclei are sheared passing through the needle and the high viscosity of the sucrose makes collection difficult. Similarly, collection of fractions beginning with the bottom of the gradient is difficult because of the high viscosity of the 2.8 M sucrose.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171214/20171214173701_4607.jpgFigure 4. Unloading ultracentrifuge tubes. 1. Identify the interface between the 2.8 M and 2.1 M sucrose solutions which contains the nuclear fraction (white arrow).",
    "It is easy to identify by DAPI fluorescence under UV light. 2. Aspirate the overlying layers to a centimeter above the nuclear fraction (white arrow). 3. Collect the nuclear fraction into the BSA-coated 50 ml conical tube. Nuclei in the fraction can be observed by DAPI fluorescence. 4. After collecting the nuclear fraction, the thin gray band of nuclei will no longer be visible and no DAPI fluorescence will be detectable in the ultracentrifuge tube or sucrose collected from the surface of the remaining solution. 5. Resuspend the collected nuclear fraction 1:10 in resuspension buffer by inverting the BSA-coated 50 ml conical tube several times. 6. Pellet the purified nuclei by centrifugation. The nuclear pellet is easy to see both with and without DAPI labeling. 7. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1.5 ml resuspension buffer. 8. Pellet the nuclei by centrifugation. Nuclei can be resuspended for imaging or washed 2 more times for biochemical and proteomic analyses.Dilute the collected interface in the 50 ml conical tube 1:10 with resuspension buffer (see Recipes). Mix by inverting 5-10 times (Figure 4 step 5).Note: The collected interface is much denser than the resuspension buffer. Be careful to completely mix the interface and resuspension buffer.Centrifuge the diluted interface in the 50 ml conical tube at 1,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C (Figure 4 step 6).Discard the supernatant and resuspend the nuclear pellet in 1 ml resuspension buffer and transfer to a 1.7 ml tube.Note: For flow cytometry and microscopy, resuspend the nuclei in chilled resuspension buffer with 1% BSA. Centrifuge the resuspended nuclei at 800 x g for 10 min at 4 °C (Figure 4 step 8). Discard the supernatant and resuspend the nuclear pellet in appropriate buffer (see Figure 5A for representative images of isolated nuclei).",
    "Notes:For flow cytometry, resuspend the nuclear pellet in 500 µl resuspension buffer with 1% BSA and pass through a 35 µm cell strainer into a 5 ml polystyrene tube before analyzing. For microscopy, resuspend the nuclear pellet in 1-3 ml resuspension buffer with 1% BSA. For Western blot or mass spectrometry, wash the nuclear pellet two more times with resuspension buffer to remove residual BSA, then resuspend in an appropriate denaturing buffer. Optional alternative approachIf biochemical purity is not critical, nuclei can be isolated more rapidly by affinity purification. Nuclei isolated by affinity purification are depleted for mitochondrial and cytoplasmic markers but retain substantial amounts of endoplasmic reticulum markers. If specific nuclear markers are known, affinity-based purification can be easily applied to other cell types (Deal and Henikoff, 2011).Note: All solutions should be chilled to 4 °C and all steps performed at 4 °C. Wash 1.5 mg Protein A-conjugated magnetic beads by incubating with 500 µl homogenization buffer in a 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tube for 5 min with rocking. Then place the tube in a magnetic separation rack and wait 20 sec for the beads to accumulate on the side of the tube and aspirate the buffer. Repeat 2 times.Add 5 µg anti-TMEM38A antibody and 200 µl homogenization buffer with 1% BSA to the washed beads. Incubate at 4 °C with low speed rocking for 30 min. Note: Magnetic beads rather than agarose or sepharose beads must be used because debris will cosediment with the agarose or sepharose beads but can be separated from magnetic beads which accumulate on the side of the tube where the magnet is placed.Process samples as described above for Steps 2-8.",
    "After centrifugation to obtain a crude nuclear pellet (described in Step 8 above), discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 ml chilled homogenization buffer with 1% BSA.Incubate the magnetic beads with the resuspended nuclei from up to 4 muscles at 4 °C for 30 min with gentle rocking. Place the tubes containing the beads in a magnetic separation rack and wait 20 sec for the beads to accumulate on the side of the tube. Aspirate the buffer and debris at the bottom of the tube.Wash the magnetic beads once with 500 µl chilled homogenization buffer with 1% BSA (see Recipes).Resuspend the beads in an appropriate buffer for the downstream application (see Figure 5B for representative images of isolated nuclei).Notes:  For flow cytometry, resuspend the nuclei in 500 µl resuspension buffer with 1% BSA and pass through a 35 µm cell strainer into a 5 ml polystyrene tube before analyzing. For microscopy, resuspend the nuclei in resuspension buffer with 1% BSA. For Western blot or mass spectrometry, wash the nuclei twice with PBS to remove residual BSA and resuspend in the appropriate denaturing buffer for downstream application.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171214/20171214175326_4004.jpgFigure 5.
