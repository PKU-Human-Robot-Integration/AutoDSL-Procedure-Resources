    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSampling\nTiming: 10 min/mouse\nThis step contains information on collecting blood, thymus, and spleen from mice to study T cells.\nEuthanize the mouse by CO2 inhalation.\nPlace the animal on its back on a dissection mat, pin the paws on the mat and wet the fur by spraying with 70% ethanol.\nMake an incision in the abdominal area above the urethral opening, without penetrating the abdominal wall, and extend the incision until the neck with a pair of straight scissors. Extent also the incision to the hind legs and pin the loose skin on the mat.\nTo study circulating T cells, collect blood by cardiac puncture. Penetrate the diaphragm from the xiphoid with a pair of straight scissors and delicately cut the ribs on each side up to the clavicle. Then lift the ribs with a pair of straight forceps with blunt points, pin them to the mat and insert a 26G × 1/2 inch needle attached to a 1 mL syringe in the lower left ventricle part of the heart to collect up to 500 μL of blood. Finally, transfer the blood to a 1.5 mL blood collection tube containing 50 μL EDTA (500 mM), invert the tube 5 times, to avoid blood clotting, and store the sample on ice.\nNote: For long-term in vivo monitoring of lymphocytes in mice, one can obtain circulating lymphocytes via submandibular vein puncture instead of cardiac puncture.\nNext, isolate the thymus by disconnecting the connective tissue surrounding the thymus and gently remove the thymic lobes using a pair of curved forceps. Place the thymus into a 1.5 mL collection tube containing 1 mL of T cell culture medium and store it on ice.",
    "Critical: While cutting the ribs and during the cardiac puncture avoid cutting the thoracic blood vessels, since this will lead to blood leakage and contamination of the thoracic cavity with circulating lymphocytes. If there is blood leakage, the thymus needs to be rinsed in 1× D-PBS before placing the thymus in the collection tube.\nFinally, isolate the spleen by making a 1.5 cm incision in the peritoneum and gently pull the spleen to the surface. Clean up the spleen by removing the pancreatic tissue attached to the spleen with a pair of straight scissors and transfer the spleen with a pair of straight, blunt pointed forceps to a 15 mL collection tube containing 3 mL of T cell culture medium.\nProcessing of samples\nTiming: 1.5–2 h\nThis step details how to prepare single-cell suspensions from spleen, thymus, and blood. Online one can find more info concerning this procedure: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0jftyYqM38[href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0jftyYqM38] and https://www.jove.com/v/61008/flow-cytometry-analysis-immune-cell-subsets-within-murine-spleen-bone[href=https://www.jove.com/v/61008/flow-cytometry-analysis-immune-cell-subsets-within-murine-spleen-bone].\nSpleen\nPour the spleen with T cell culture medium into a 10 mm bacterial Petri dish.\nCritical: For maintaining aseptic conditions, work under a fume hood.\nWhile holding the spleen in the Petri dish with a pair of straight forceps with blunt points, flush out the splenocytes by injecting T cell culture medium (collected from the Petri dish) in the spleen with a 3 mL syringe (26G × 1/2 inch needle).\nSmash the spleen by using the plunger of the 3 mL syringe and a pair of straight blunt pointed forceps.\nTransfer the medium containing the smashed spleen to a 70 μm cell strainer on top of a 50 mL tube.\nUse the plunger again to smash the remaining spleen pieces on the cell strainer.",
    "Rinse the Petri dish with 3 mL of T cell culture medium to get all remaining spleen pieces and transfer them to the 70 μm cell strainer.\nSmash the remaining spleen pieces.\nRinse the 70 μm cell strainer with 3 mL of T cell culture medium, discard the cell strainer, and place the sample immediately on ice.\nCentrifuge the sample at 400 × g for 4 min at 4°C.\nNote: To decrease experimental time if you are working alone, we advise to start preparing thymic single-cell suspensions during the centrifugation steps of splenocytes isolation.\nDiscard supernatant using a vacuum pump and add 2 mL of ACK lysis buffer to the 50 mL tube, close the tube, and resuspend the splenocytes by pulse vortexing. Incubate for 3 min at 20°C–25°C.\nAdd 6 mL of T cell culture medium to stop the lysis of red blood cells, place the 50 mL tube on ice and centrifuge the sample at 400 × g for 4 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the splenocytes with 3 mL of T cell culture medium and keep on ice until stimulation/staining.\nCount splenocytes with a counting chamber (1:100 dilution in 0.1% trypan blue).\nThymus\nTransfer the thymus to a 70 μm cell strainer on top of a 50 mL tube using a clean pair of straight forceps with blunt points.\nSmash the thymus on the cell strainer using the plunger of a new 3 mL syringe and rinse the cell strainer with 3 mL of T cell culture medium.\nSmash the remaining thymus pieces, rinse the cell strainer once more with 3 mL of T cell culture medium and place the sample on ice.\nCentrifuge the sample at 400 × g for 4 min at 4°C.",
    "Discard the supernatant and resuspend the thymocytes with 3 mL of T cell culture medium and keep on ice until staining.\nCount thymocytes with a counting chamber (1:100 dilution in 0.1% trypan blue).\nBlood\nTransfer the blood sample to a 15 mL tube containing 5 mL of ACK lysis buffer, close tube, vortex shortly (5 s) and incubate at RT for 3 min.\nPut the tubes back on ice and add 8 mL cold T cell culture medium to stop red blood cells lysis.\nCentrifuge the sample at 400 × g for 4 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cells with 200 μL of T cell culture medium. Keep on ice until staining.\nNote: Most of the time, this experiment is labor-intensive. Therefore, we recommend having ≥ two people working together to prepare single-cell suspensions (preferably one researcher per tissue).\nNote: Instead of T cell culture medium, one can use 1× D-PBS for the rinsing steps and to stop the ACK lysis step.\nStimulation of splenocytes for intracellular cytokine staining (ICS)\nTiming: 4.5 h\nThis step details how to stimulate splenic single-cell suspensions with PMA/ionomycin/BFA to assess the intracellular cytokine production of T cells.\nStimulation of splenocytes\nPrepare a 10× mix of PMA/ionomycin/BFA by adding 0.5 μL PMA, 6.66 μL ionomycin and 5 μL BFA to 987.84 μL T cell culture medium (concentration 500 ng/mL, 5,000 ng/mL and 100 μg/mL, respectively). The volume needed is 20 μL/sample.\nPrepare a 10× mix with only BFA by adding 0.5 μL BFA to 99.5 μL T cell culture medium (concentration 10 μg/mL). The volume needed is 20 μL/sample.\nNote: After use, immediately place the stock solution of ionomycin at 4°C and the stock solutions of PMA and BFA at −20°C.",
    "Transfer 1.5 million splenocytes to a well of a 48-well flat-bottom culture plate. Adjust the volume in the well at 180 μL by adding T cell culture medium.\nNote: The flow cytometry analysis requires additional samples for unstained, single-stained cell, and negative cell controls, as described in step 10c. You need one negative cell control, one unstained control and ten single-stained cell control samples (see Tables 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl7] and 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl8]).\nAdd 20 μL of the PMA/ionomycin/BFA mix (final concentration for T cell stimulation is 50 ng/mL, 500 ng/mL, 10 μg/mL, respectively) to all samples, with the exception of the negative control sample to which 20 μL of the BFA only mix (final concentration 10 μg/mL) is added.\nPlace the culture plate in a 37°C, 5% CO2 cell culture incubator for 4 h.\nAfter 4 h, place the culture plate on ice until intracellular cytokine staining.\nCritical: For maintaining aseptic conditions, work under a fume hood.\nFlow cytometry antibody staining of T cells in blood, thymus, and spleen\nTiming: 5–6 h\nThis step details the staining of splenic, thymic and blood single-cell suspensions with fluorophore-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (see Tables 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1], 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2], 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3], 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4], 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5], 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6], 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl7], and 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl8]) to study T cells in spleen, thymus, and blood. Single-stained cell control samples are needed to set the PMT voltage for each parameter and single-stained eBeads (UltraComp eBeads Compensation beads) controls are needed for compensation, except for the Fixable Viability Dye for which cells will be used. Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] shows an example of a plate layout to stain for T cell activation and Treg cell functionality in ten mouse spleens.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_488_1.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_488_2.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_488_3.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_488_4.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_488_5.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_488_6.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_488_7.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_488_8.csv\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/488-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Layout of a 96-well v-bottom plate setup for the staining of splenic T cell activation and Treg cell functionality of ten mice",
    "Splenocytes are stained with the antibody mix for the extracellular staining and the intracellular staining as indicated in Tables 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] and described in step 12, single-stained cell controls and eBeads compensation controls are stained with the indicated fluorophore-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies, based on Tables 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]. FMO, fluorescence minus one; FVD, fixable viability dye.\nCritical: All antibodies and buffers should be kept on ice while preparing antibody mixes.\nNote: Tables 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1], 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2], 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3], 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4], 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5], 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6], 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl7], and 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl8] provide antibody volumes to stain one sample (final staining volume 100 μL). To stain more than one sample, prepare an excess of two samples by multiplying the indicated volumes by the number of samples + 2.\nNote: To aid with the discrimination of certain gates, one can set up fluorescent minus one (FMO) controls, where the marker of interest is omitted from the staining mix. In this protocol we recommend the use of FMO controls for CD152 (CTLA4) and the CD120b (TNFR2) antibodies to aid the gating for CTLA4+ and TNFR2+ Treg cells. However, the use of FMO controls can be extended to other markers, depending on the experience of the researcher.\nBefore you begin with the antibody staining, freshly prepare the following:\neBeads mix: add 7 drops from the stock vial to a 15 mL tube containing 7 mL 1× D-PBS (1 drop/mL). Vortex thoroughly and keep on ice. 200 μL of eBeads mix is required per anti-mouse antibody.\nAntibody mixes for the extracellular staining of cells with fluorophore-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies in the appropriately labeled 1.5 mL Eppendorfs, by following the volumes indicated in Tables 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1], 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3], 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5], and 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl7].\nStart by adding 1× D-PBS to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf.",
    "Note: The volume of 1× D-PBS for one sample is based on the following formula: volume of 1× D-PBS = 100 μL (final staining volume/sample) - sum of antibodies - volume of BD Horizon Brilliant Stain Buffer.\nContinue by adding BD Horizon Brilliant Stain Buffer (at a dilution of 1/2 of the final staining volume).\nCritical: BD Horizon Brilliant Stain Buffer is required when more than one BD Horizon Brilliant dye-conjugated antibody is used in the same flow panel to prevent the non-specific polymer interactions which can lead to data appearing under-compensated. In this experiment, BD Horizon Brilliant Stain Buffer is used only in the antibody mixes of Tables 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl7].\nContinue by adding fluorophore-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies and the Fixable Viability Dye.\nOnce finished, vortex for 5 s.\nStore mixes in the fridge at 4°C.\nNote: The antibody mixes can be made the day before, but the Fixable Viability Dye has to be added just before adding the staining mix to the samples.\nAlternatives: We use Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 506 because its emission spectrum is compatible with our antibody staining panels. Alternatives, with similar emission properties, are the Zombie Aqua Fixable Viability Kit from BioLegend (cat# 23101) and the LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit by Invitrogen (cat# L34957). For the panel described in Tables 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2], the LIVE/DEAD Fixable Green Dead Cell Stain Kit by Invitrogen (cat# L23101), with different emission properties, can be used instead of Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 506. These alternative viability dyes have not been tested and need further optimization.\nCritical: Since this experiment is labor-intensive, we recommend starting with the staining of T cells in splenic, thymic and blood single-cell suspensions during the 4 h incubation period of PMA/ionomycin/BFA-stimulated splenocytes.",
    "Critical: Since some surface markers like CD62L are temperature sensitive, always keep the 96-well v-bottom polypropylene plate on ice during the staining procedure and use a centrifuge set at 4°C.\nCritical: All incubation steps should be done in the dark.\nStaining for T cell activation and Treg cell functionality in the spleen of mice (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] for a layout of a 96-well plate to stain splenocytes from ten mice).\nTransfer 1.5 million splenocytes into a well of a 96-well polypropylene v-bottom plate. Keep the plate on ice.\nAdd an unstained cell control and 10 single-stained cell controls by transferring 1.5 million splenocytes into 11 wells of the 96-well v-bottom plate.\nNote: For the CD152 FMO and the CD120b FMO you need two additional wells with 1.5 million cells.\nHeat-kill 1.5 million splenocytes for 1 min at 95°C to generate a positive cell control for dead cells.\nPlace heat-killed cells on ice for 1 min. Mix heat-killed cells with 1.5 million splenocytes of a single-stained cell control sample. Use this sample as a single-stained cell control for the Fixable Viability Dye.\nCentrifuge the plate at 400 × g for 4 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend cell pellets with 200 μL 1× D-PBS.\nCentrifuge the plate at 400 × g for 4 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend cell pellets with 100 μL of extracellular staining antibody mix (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nNote: Resuspend the CD152 FMO control in 100 μL of antibody mix for the extracellular staining. Be aware, do not add anti-CD120b antibody in the extracellular staining antibody mix for the CD120b FMO.",
    "Resuspend unstained and single-stained cell controls with 100 μL of Fc blocking buffer (see Materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) and add x μL of the relevant extracellular staining antibody to the proper sample. Do not add antibody to the single-stained cell controls used for the detection of intracellular FoxP3 and CD152.\nNote: In this case x μL is calculated based on the antibody's final dilution, as indicated in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\nAdd 200 μL of eBeads mix to ten wells of the 96-well v-bottom plate and add 0.5 μL of the corresponding extracellular antibody, except for Alexa Fluor 700 and for APC-eFluor780: 1 μL and for PE, PE-tandem, and BV dyes: 0.2 μL.",
    "Note: In this protocol, we use eBeads as compensation controls. We are aware that some labs prefer single-stained cell for compensation controls in multicolor flow cytometry experiments. However, for proper compensation one needs a distinct negative and positive population. This will be challenging for markers expressed on a low number of cells, such as FoxP3 and some intracellular cytokines. Therefore, we use eBeads that have a robust signal regardless of the fluorophore-conjugated antibody that is bound. These eBeads consist of two populations of beads: one that captures any mouse, rat, or hamster antibody and one that does not react with antibodies. Adding a fluorophore-conjugated antibody will result in a negative and positive peak, generating a bimodal distribution that can be used to perform compensation. Most of the fluorophore-conjugated antibodies produce an optimal bimodal distribution at average concentrations. However, we have determined that for very bright fluorophores, such as PE, PE-tandem, and BV dyes, less antibody should be used to keep the positive peak on scale. In contrast, we have observed that for dim fluorophores, such as AF700, APC-Cy7, and APC-eFluor780, more antibody is needed to achieve an optimal separation of the two peaks.\nCritical: Since eBeads precipitate rapidly, vortex eBeads mix thoroughly while adding them to the 96-well v-bottom plate.\nMix samples and eBeads by pipetting up and down and incubate on ice for 20 min in the dark.\nNote: During the incubation of samples with the antibody mix for extracellular staining, prepare all required buffers to detect intracellular FoxP3 and CTLA4 expression in T cells, as described in the datasheet of the eBioscience Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2F00-5523.pdf&title=VGVjaG5pY2FsIERhdGEgU2hlZXQ6IEZveHAzIC8gVHJhbnNjcmlwdGlvbiBGYWN0b3IgU3RhaW5pbmcgQnVmZmVyIFNldA[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2F00-5523.pdf&title=VGVjaG5pY2FsIERhdGEgU2hlZXQ6IEZveHAzIC8gVHJhbnNjcmlwdGlvbiBGYWN0b3IgU3RhaW5pbmcgQnVmZmVyIFNldA]).\nAdd 100 μL 1× D-PBS to each sample, beads excluded, and centrifuge at 400 × g for 4 min at 4°C.",
    "Discard the supernatant and resuspend samples and eBeads with 100 μL fixation buffer.\nIncubate samples on ice for 30 min in the dark.\nPrepare the antibody mix for the intracellular staining (see Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]) in an appropriately labeled 1.5 mL Eppendorf and store in the fridge at 4°C.\nStart by adding 1× Permeabilization buffer.\nContinue by adding fluorophore-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies.\nCentrifuge plate at 400 × g for 4 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend cell pellets with 100 μL of intracellular staining antibody mix.\nNote: Resuspend the CD120b FMO control in 100 μL of antibody mix for intracellular staining.

    "Transfer 1–1.5 million thymocytes and 100 μL of the blood single-cell suspension containing ∼ 0.2–1 million white blood cells into two distinct 96-well polypropylene v-bottom plates (pre-labeled as thymus and blood plate). Keep both plates on ice.\nSet up an unstained cell control and four single-stained cell controls by transferring 1.5 million thymocytes to the thymus-labeled 96-well v-bottom plate.\nSet up an unstained cell control and seven single-stained cell controls by transferring 50 μL of the blood single-cell suspension (a pool of the blood samples can be used) to the blood-labeled 96-well v-bottom plate.\nSet up single-stained cell controls for the Fixable Viability Dye (1:1 mix of alive and heat-killed cells) in both plates as described in steps 12c and d.\nContinue with the extracellular and intracellular antibody staining of thymocytes and white blood cells by following the previously described steps 12e–w.

    "Discard the supernatant, resuspend cell pellets with 200 μL 1× D-PBS and follow the same procedure of extracellular staining with antibodies as described in steps 12g–l. Always refer to Table 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl7] for the appropriate extracellular antibody mix for the staining of cells.\nNote: During the incubation of samples with the antibody mix for extracellular staining, prepare all required buffers to detect intracellular cytokine production in T cells, as described in the datasheet of the BD Cytofix/Cytoperm Fixation/Permeabilization Solution Kit (https://www.bdbiosciences.com/ds/pm/others/554714_554715_555028_Book_Website.pdf[href=https://www.bdbiosciences.com/ds/pm/others/554714_554715_555028_Book_Website.pdf]).\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend samples and eBeads with 100 μL fixation buffer.\nIncubate samples on ice for 30 min in the dark.\nPrepare the intracellular cytokine antibody staining as described in step 12o and store in the fridge at 4°C (see Table 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl8]).\nCentrifuge plate at 400 × g for 4 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend non- and PMA/ionomycin-stimulated splenocytes with 100 μL of intracellular staining antibody mix.\nResuspend unstained and single-stained cell controls with 100 μL 1× Permeabilization buffer and add x μL of the relevant intracellular staining antibody to the proper sample.\nNote: In this case x μL is calculated based on the antibody's final dilution, as indicated in Table 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl8].\nResuspend eBeads with 200 μL 1× Permeabilization buffer and add 0.5 μL of the corresponding intracellular antibody to the beads, except for Alexa Fluor 700 and APC-eFluor780: 1 μL and for PE, PE-tandem, and BV dyes: 0.2 μL.\nIncubate samples on ice for 30 min in the dark.\nAdd 100 μL 1× Permeabilization buffer to each sample (not to the eBeads) and centrifuge at 400 × g for 4 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend samples and eBeads with 200 μL FACS buffer (see Materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).",

Use unstained and single-stained cell controls to set suitable PMT voltages. For the FSC and SSC, voltages are set so that the cells can be discriminated from the debris, which should be present in the lower left of a FSC-A versus SSC-A plot (see Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). For the other parameters the CS&T baseline target voltages are a good starting point to set PMT voltages. If a positive population of a single-stained cell control is not on scale, lower the PMT voltage to have the positive population on scale. For auto-compensation, use the eBeads control samples and the heat-killed cell sample stained with Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 506. Once the PMT voltages are set and the auto-compensation is done, acquire at least 0.5 million living cells per tube.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/488-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.
