    "1. Two-layer Platform Fabrication\nFabrication of multilayer masters\nSpin coat epoxy-based negative photoresist (~63.45% solids, 1,250 cSt) according to the manufacturer's specifications (2,000 rpm for 45 s) onto a 4 inch diameter silicon wafer to obtain the desired height of 20 µm for the first design layer.\nSoft-bake the resist coated wafers for 4 min at 95 °C. Allow wafer to cool for 5 min. Expose the wafer to UV light for 15 s (~150 mJ/cm2 at 365 nm) through a photomask in a UV contact aligner to define the geometry of the bottom layer.\nPost-exposure bake the wafer for 5 min at 95 °C. Without developing, return the wafer to the spin coater and spin on a second layer of epoxy-based negative photoresist (~76.75% solids, 80,000 cSt) at 3,000 rpm to achieve a second layer height of 150 - 200 µm.\nAllow the wafer to rest for 5 min before transferring to a 95 °C hotplate for 45 min. After baking on the hotplate, remove the wafer and allow the resist to cool and harden at room temperature for another 5 min on a flat level surface. Align and expose the wafer to the second layer photomask for 30 s in a UV contact aligner (dose of approximately 300 mJ/cm2).\nPerform a post-exposure bake by placing the wafer on a hotplate for 15 min at 95 °C, and then allow the wafer to cool on a flat level surface for 5 min before developing.\nDevelop both resist layers simultaneously by placing the wafer into a plastic dish and submerging the wafer in the appropriate developer (see Materials Table). Gently rock the dish occasionally to wash fresh developer over the wafer.",
    "After 17 min, rinse the wafer with isopropanol (IPA). If a white film appears, continue to iterate between rinsing the wafer with developer and IPA until the film disappears. Dry the patterned silicon wafer with nitrogen.\nPolydimethylsiloxane Soft-lithography\nExpose the silicon wafer to an air plasma for 30 s in a plasma cleaner set on high (see Materials Table) to clean. Silanize the wafer with trichloro (1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluoro-n-octyl) silane in a chemical hood on a hotplate below the flashpoint of the silane (85 °C) for 2 h.\nPour a 10:1 ratio of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to curing agent onto the silicon master wafer. Degas the mixed PDMS in a vacuum chamber and then cure the polymer in a 70 °C oven for 1 h or until the PDMS is fully cured.\nUsing a scalpel, cut the PDMS devices and peel them from the silicon master wafer. Use a 1.5 mm biopsy punch to create seed and treatment inlets, punching the seed inlet at a 45° angle to encourage root growth into the main channel.\nUse clear adhesive tape to remove debris from the PDMS device and place the device design side down on a glass coverslip. Autoclave the assembled devices.\n2. Planting Devices\nArabidopsis thaliana  seed preparation\nSurface sterilize A. thaliana seeds in a microfuge tube with a solution of 30% commercially available bleach diluted in de-ionized water and 0.1% Triton X detergent for 7 min. Wash seeds 4 times with sterile water.\nStratify seeds by refrigerating microfuge tube overnight or up to a week at 4 °C.\nDevice Preparation\nPlace sterilized devices in a vacuum degassing chamber to remove air from the gas permeable PDMS and fluidic channels to improve ease of filling.",
    "Remove the devices from the vacuum chamber and immediately submerge the devices in a Petri dish filled with liquid ¼ strength plant based media at pH 5.7.\nUsing a pipette, pull liquid through the inlets to fill the device. Make sure no air bubbles remain within channels by visual inspection.\nTransfer individual devices to new dry Petri dishes. Pour or pipette hot agar around the device until the agar level is almost flush with the top of the PDMS device. Allow agar to solidify.\n\t\tNOTE: Devices are now ready for planting seeds or can be stored at 4 °C until needed.\nPlanting seeds within devices\nIn a sterile environment, transfer one sterilized seed to the inlet of each device using a small pipette.\nCover the Petri dish with wax film (see Materials Table) and place in a light/dark cycling growth chamber or windowsill at room temperature. Orient the Petri dish so that the devices are vertical and gravity will encourage the roots to grow through the channel.\n3. Treatment\nExperimental Treatments\nAt the desired time in the seedling's development, add the experimental treatment to the seedling by adding a prescribed amount of the treatment to each of the 8 side ports via pipette.\nReseal the Petri dish and return to growth chamber or windowsill.\nProceed with imaging samples at the desired time to capture individual time points or begin time lapse imaging.\n4. Optical Imaging\nLower Resolution (4 - 20X) Imaging",
    "Place the entire Petri dish containing the device and seedling under an inverted bright field microscope for lower resolution (4 - 20X) bright field or differential interference contrast (DIC) imaging. Optimize lighting conditions to elucidate morphological features of interest by adjusting exposure times, lamp brightness, aperture, and the polarity of light. Drive the stage to the desired area of the root and focus on the root or root hair(s) of interest.\nAcquire a single time point or a time series of images. To visualize the growth of root hairs, image growing root hairs once per min. To visualize the growth of the main root, acquire one image every 30 min. Return the Petri dish and the seedlings to growth chamber or windowsill in a vertical position after imaging is complete.\nHigher Resolution (20 - 63X) Imaging\nOnce the seedling has grown for a desired time, use forceps to remove coverslip and device from the agar. Clean off the bottom of the coverslip using an ethanol wetted laboratory tissue.\nApply the recommended immersion media to the objective as suggested by the microscope lens manufacturer. Place the coverslip down on the microscope stage and raise the stage to contact the immersion media on the objective. Optimize the lighting conditions by adjusting exposure times, lamp brightness, aperture, and the polarity of light. Drive the stage to the desired area and focus on root hair(s) of interest.\n\t\tNOTE: DIC is needed to visualize cytoplasmic streaming, and fluorescence markers are needed to visualize organelle movement.",
    "To quantify root hair growth over time, acquire one image per min. To visualize organelle movement, minimize the fluorescence exposure time while still retaining an identifiable fluorescence signal from the organelles. Acquire images of the organelles as quickly as the exposure time allows. For longer time-lapse imaging, use a live-cell imaging stage incubator to maintain ambient temperature and moisture.\n\t\tNOTE: A 63X oil objective is recommended for imaging root hair organelles.\n5. Non-Optical Imaging\nDevice preparation\nOnce seedling has grown for desired time, remove the device and coverslip from the Petri dish.\nTurn device upside down and gently peel away the coverslip so that the root stays within the PDMS channel.\nProceed to use the PDMS device as a substrate for the root in higher resolution atomic force or scanning electron microscopy.\nScanning Electron Microscopy\nDeposit a thin (~20 nm) layer of chromium onto the root and surrounding PDMS using a Dual Gun Electron Beam Evaporation Chamber.\nTransfer the root and PDMS device to a scanning electron microscope chamber.\n\t\tNOTE: Imaging conditions, i.e. voltage, current and working distance will need to be optimized to achieve the desired resolution for a given application.\nAtomic Force Microscopy (AFM)\nMount the PDMS device root side up on an AFM specimen holder. To increase contrast in the camera and more easily distinguish the root from the PDMS, place the PDMS device on a flat reflective substrate (such as mica coated in gold) before mounting the device on the AFM specimen holder.\nSecure a liquid well attachment on top of the PDMS device and fill it with water to keep the roots hydrated during imaging.",
    "Load the specimen holder into the AFM. Adjust the z-control for the thickness of the PDMS device and drive the cantilever to the region of interest on the root using a camera for guidance.\nAlign the laser with the tip of the cantilever. For best results with contact mode imaging, use cantilevers with spring constants of 0.01 or 0.03 N/m to exert minimal force on the root during scanning.\nSlowly lower the scanning mechanism until the cantilever just makes contact with the sample. Adjust the scan size for the desired region and choose a scan speed of 1 line/s with 256 voltage points per line. Acquire the scan.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
