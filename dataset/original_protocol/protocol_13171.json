    "The following protocol developed at our institution (Zealand University Hospital) follows the Danish national guidelines on human research ethics.Written and informed consent was obtained from the human subjects.\n1. Preparation for EUS-B\nNOTE: This procedure requires experience in performing bronchoscopy / EBUS, thus the following instruction will not include details on basic steps such as sedation, monitoring etc. which are common for bronchoscopy, EBUS and EUS-B.\nEvaluate available computed tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scans in order to locate target lesions reachable by EUS-B (see Figure 2). Make sure that antithrombotic therapy is paused according to guidelines. Obtain patient's informed consent.\nExclude patients with increased risk of perforation (e.g., recent bowel surgery, bowel obstruction, esophageal stenosis), coagulopathy or impaired platelet function.\nPosition the patient in a supine position and apply monitoring similar to bronchoscopy or EBUS according to institutional standards. Many sites continuously monitor 3-lead telemetry, oxygen saturation, pulse and intermittent blood pressure.\nInitiate conscious sedation similar to bronchoscopy or EBUS according to institutional standards, such as IV midazolam 2.5 mg (for sedation) and IV Fentanyl 25 µg (for cough and pain).\n2. Performing EUS-B\nPerform EUS-B using the EBUS echoendoscope, which is typically 60 cm long (EUS is 125 cm) and the average diameter of the regular scope is between 6 and 7 mm (EUS is 12 - 14 mm).\nStand behind the patient´s head who is in a supine position. Hold the handle of the endoscope with the left hand with the thumb on the lever and hold the distal end of the endoscope with the right hand.\nApply local anesthetic gel (nasal route) or spray (oral route) on the mucosa 1-2 min before endoscopy.",
    "Introduce the endoscope into the oropharynx, either orally or through the nostril, after applying local anesthetic gel on the tip of the endoscope.\nAdvance into the laryngopharynx while the epiglottis is in front of the scope and visualize the vocal cords using the bronchoscopic view.\n\t\nTurn the scope left or right to direct the scope lateral to the arytenoids. Ask the patient to swallow and slowly bend the endoscope posteriorly and introduce it into the esophagus. Never use force but follow the downward direction of the patient's voluntary swallowing movement, where the esophageal lumen is widened. Patient-operator coordination is vital.\nSpray 2 mL of topical lidocaine in the oropharynx if the endoscope is not successfully introduced into the esophagus.\nShift to the ultrasonic image and introduce the endoscope into the stomach, and start identifying the six EUS landmarks in a stepwise and chronological order as described in19 and below (Figure 3).\n\t\nThe left liver lobe - turn the endoscope slightly counterclockwise (Landmark 1).\nThe abdominal aorta with the celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery - turn the scope clockwise (Landmark 2).\nThe left adrenal gland - turn the scope further clockwise (Landmark 3).\nMediastinal lymph node station 7 -retract the endoscope to the mediastinum. This is situated close to the left atrium and right pulmonary artery (Landmark 4).\nMediastinal lymph node station 4L - retract the endoscope a few centimeters and notice the reflections from the trachea. Then, turn the endoscope counterclockwise and find 4L between the aortic arch and the left pulmonary artery (the mickey mouse sign; Landmark 5).",
    "Mediastinal lymph node station 4R - turn the endoscope clockwise, pass the trachea and find the azygos vein (confirm by retracting the scope and the vein should disappear into the superior vena cava). 4R is near the azygos vein (Landmark 6).\n3. Tissue sample collection\nTake tissue samples from suspected lesions under real-time ultrasonographic guidance using the FNA needle. The needles on the market are slightly different, but the principles for their use are the same.\n\t\nInsert the sheath in the endosope and adjust the length so that the tip is 1 mm outside the endoscope and lock it.\nMove the needle with the stylet forward and retract the stylet a few millimeters (if the tip is rounded) to make the needle sharp. This step is not needed if the stylet is sharp.\nHit the target, retract the stylet, and apply suction to the needle.\nMove the needle back and forth. Then remove suction, lock the needle in the upper position and remove the equipment from the endoscope.\nMake sure that the biopsy order is M1b-M1a-N3-N2-N1-T (M = metastasis, N = lymph node, T = tumor) to avoid iatrogenic upstaging.\nSubscription Required.
