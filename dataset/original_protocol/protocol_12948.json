    "Ethics Statement: Protocols were approved by the Indiana University Institutional Review Board. Parents of subjects provided written informed consent, and children older than 7 years provided assent for their participation.\n1. Serum Processing\nNOTE: The assay as described has been rigorously tested using human serum isolated as follows.\nCollect blood in one red top (no-additive; uncoated) blood collection tube.\nLet sit at room temperature for 30 min to allow the clot to form.\nCentrifuge tube at 2,000 x g for 10 min at room temperature. Transfer the supernatant (serum) to a new tube designated for serum storage (polypropylene screw top tubes, size dependent on samples).\nStore samples at -80 ºC until ready for DNA isolation.\n2. Serum DNA Extraction\nNOTE: DNA is extracted with a DNA extraction kit using 50 µl of serum (recommended), following manufacturer's protocol with some modifications.\nPrepare 200 µl lysis buffer + 1 µl poly(A) (5 µg) per sample in an microcentrifuge tube. Vortex for 15 sec. Set aside until Step 2.3.\nTake serum samples from -80 ºC freezer and thaw at room temperature. Bring serum sample volume up to 200 µl total using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, with calcium chloride and magnesium chloride).\nLyse the sample by adding 20 µl protease (1.4 Anson units/ml) to sample, followed by 200 µl lysis buffer/polyA mix (from Step 2.2) and vortex for 8 sec. Incubate sample at 56 °C for 10 min, then briefly centrifuge for 7 sec at top speed in a microcentrifuge (>10,000 x g).\nPrecipitate DNA by adding 230 µl 100% ethanol to sample and vortex for 8 sec. Briefly centrifuge for 7 sec at top speed (>10,000 x g).",
    "Apply the DNA to the spin column by adding 600 µl sample mixture to mini spin column. Centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 1 min. Discard the flow-through and place column in a clean tube.\nWash the DNA by adding 500 µl wash buffer 1 to the column. Centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 1 min. Discard the flow-through and place column in a clean tube. Add 500 µl wash buffer 2 to column and centrifuge at top speed (>10,000 x g) for 3 min. Place column in a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge at top speed again for 1 min.\nElute the DNA by placing column in a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and adding 60 µl elution buffer directly on the filter. It is important to switch tips between samples to prevent cross contamination. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min, then centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 1 min. Add another 60 μl of elution buffer and centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 1 min. \nStore DNA at -20 ºC for later use, or proceed immediately to bisulfite conversion.\n3. Bisulfite Conversion\nNOTE: Bisulfite conversion is performed using a bisulfite conversion kit, following the manufacturer's protocol with some modifications.\nTo convert unmethylated cytosines to uracils, add 130 µl of bisulfite conversion reagent to 20 µl of DNA from step 2.7 in a PCR tube (single 0.2 ml PCR tube or 8-strip PCR tubes). Save the remaining 40 µl of DNA for future use, or use in replicate reactions. Mix 20 times by pipetting up and down and centrifuge briefly to make sure no drops are on sides or lid. Incubate in a water bath or thermal cycler as follows: 98 °C for 8 min, 54 °C for 60 min, 4 °C for 5 min.",
    "Proceed to step 3.2 or store at 4 °C for up to 20 hr.\nAdd 600 µl of binding buffer to spin column and place the column in the provided collection tube. Apply the bisulfited DNA to column and mix by pipetting up and down 10 times. Centrifuge at top speed (>10,000 x g) for 30 sec. Discard flow-through.\nWash DNA by adding 100 µl of wash buffer to column and centrifuge at top speed (>10,000 x g) for 30 sec.\nPerform desulphonation to remove sulphonate group to finalize the conversion of unmethylated cytosines to uracil by adding 200 µl of desulphonation buffer to the column. Let stand at room temperature for 20 min, then centrifuge at top speed (>10,000 x g) for 30 sec.\nWash DNA by adding 200 µl of wash buffer to the column and centrifuge at full speed for 30 sec. Discard the flow-through and repeat this wash step.\nPlace the column into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Elute DNA by adding 10 µl elution buffer directly to column filter. Incubate for 1 min. Centrifuge for 30 s at full speed to elute DNA. Quantify recovered DNA by spectrophotometry at A260.\n\tNOTE: The DNA detected by spectrophotometry represents primarily the carrier polyA DNA that was added at step 2.3 above. Typically, recovery of polyA is ≥85% of the input (>4.25 µg).\nStore DNA at -20 °C until ready to proceed with digital PCR.\n4. Multiplex Digital PCR\nMake a master mix with enough solution for each sample and control. Include at least one sample containing water (negative control), one sample of a plasmid containing unmethylated INS (1 pg, positive control), one sample of plasmid containing methylated INS (1 pg, positive control), and one sample containing a 1:1 mixture of plasmids.",
    "To prepare the PCR master mix, add 12.5 µl per reaction of PCR buffer (e.g., 125 µl per 10 samples), 1.25 µl per reaction primer/probe mix (e.g., 12.5 µl per 10 samples), 8.25 µl per reaction water (e.g., 82.5 µl per 10 samples), 0.5 µl per reaction EcoR1 enzyme (e.g., 5 µl per 10 samples).\n\t\tNOTE: Primers and probes used here are as follows: Forward Primer: 5'-GGAAATTGTAGTTTTAGTTTTTAGTTATTTGT-3'; Reverse Primer: 5'-AAAACCCATCTCCCCTACCTATCA-3'; FAM probe: FAM-5'-ACCCCTACCACCTAAC-3'-MGB; VIC probe: VIC-5'-ACCCCTACCGCCTAAC-3'-MGB.\nSet up multiplex PCR reaction in a 96-well plate. Add 19.5 µl of master mix to each well. Add 2.5 µl of bisulfite converted DNA sample into each appropriate well (save the remaining 7.5 µl of bisulfite converted DNA or use in replicate reactions). Mix by pipetting up and down several times.\n\tNOTE: All 8 wells in a row must contain sample or buffer control.\nSeal with a foil seal using a plate sealer and centrifuge in a plate spinner until there is no liquid on the sides of the wells.\nSet up the automated droplet generator on the touchscreen.\n\tNOTE: All 8 wells in the cartridge must contain sample or buffer control.\n\t\nSet the number of rows being used by touching the row(s) in which samples are loaded into on the 96-well plate from step 4.2 and highlight the row in blue to indicate an active row.\nLoad consumables from back to front to avoid contamination. To start, add cartridges along the back row of the instrument. Load tips into center row of the instrument.\n\t\tNOTE: The cartridges can only fit into the holders in the correct orientation.\nPlace 96-well plate into the instrument. Remove a cold block from -20 °C freezer and place a new skirted 96-well plate into it. Place it inside the instrument next to the sample loaded 96-well plate.",
    "Add oil to dispenser in the front of the instrument. Select type of oil on touchscreen.\nTouch the blue start button to start the run. Confirm plate setup and touch start run button to begin.\nOnce finished, remove the 96-well plate that contains the newly formed droplets and seal with a foil seal using a plate sealer.\nPerform PCR10 on a thermal cycler using the following program: 95 °C for 10:00 min; 40 cycles at: 94 °C for 00:30 min, 57.5 °C for 01:00 min; 98 °C for 10:00 min; 12 °C for 10 min or up to 24 hr.\nPlace the plate on the droplet reader and set up the reader.\n\t\nClick on the setup tab. Open a new template by clicking template > new. Enter a file name.\nUse the well editor to set the parameters for each sample. Give each sample a unique name, set experiment to Rare Event Detection (R-RED), and set master mix to the mix used in step 4.1.\nGive Target 1 a name (i.e., unmethylated) and set Target 1 as unknown (U). Give Target 2 a name (i.e., methylated) and set Target 2 as reference (R).\nClick Run tab to start the run. In the run options window, select the detection chemistry (FAM/VIC).\n5. Data Analysis\nOpen results in analyze tab and analyze using 2-D plot based on positive controls (see Figure 1).\nExport CSV file generated by droplet reader to a spreadsheet program for data analysis.\nTo generate \"copies per µl\" of serum, use the formula: (concentration*250)/(volume of serum used for DNA isolation in µl).6\n\tNOTE: The data is typically converted to log10 when acquired from human serum to ensure normal distribution. Alternatively, data can be plotted on a log10 scale and analyzed by non-parametric statistics.",
