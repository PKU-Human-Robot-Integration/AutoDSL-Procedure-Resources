  "procedures": [
    "1. Worm sample collection\nSeed mixed stage or synchronized13 worms on NGM solid plates at the required temperature and allow the worms to grow until the desired stage. For basic C. elegans growth and maintenance, please see Stiernagle et al. and Porta-de-la-Riva et al.14,13.\nCollect worms in a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube by washing the worm plates with M9 buffer.\nPellet the worms by centrifuging at 400 x g at room temperature (RT) for 2 min and discard the supernatant.\n\tNOTE: The worm pellet size for extract preparation is between 100 µL and 500 µL. A 300 µL pellet of packed worms is recommended for downstream immunoprecipitation experiments and typically yields ~4.5 mg of total protein, while a 500 µL pellet will yield ~7.5 mg of total protein.\nPerform additional 3–5 washes with M9 buffer (see Table 1) or until the supernatant is no longer cloudy.\nPerform one final wash with ddH2O.\nMove the loose worm pellet to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and spin down at 400 x g at RT for 2 min. Discard the remaining supernatant to obtain a packed worm pellet and proceed to extract preparation.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here. Worm pellets may be flash frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately and stored at -80 °C or in liquid nitrogen. Please note that worm pellets can only be thawed once and cannot be refrozen.\n2. Extract preparation of the worm pellet\nNOTE: The extract preparation should be performed on ice or at 4 °C.\nIf frozen, thaw worm pellet on ice.\n\tNOTE: If the desired packed worm pellet size of 300 µL was not obtained during sample collection, multiple smaller pellets can be combined until enough material is present for further extraction.",
    "Add an equal volume of ice-cold 2x lysis buffer (60 mM HEPES, pH = 7.4, 100 mM potassium chloride, 0.1% Triton X, 4 mM magnesium chloride, 10% glycerol, 2 mM DTT with RNase inhibitor, protease inhibitor, and phosphatase inhibitors; see Table 1) and vortex or pipette up and down to mix. Spin the tube(s) down to collect the mixture at the bottom of the tube.\nMove the mixture into a 1.5 mL RNase-free tube containing metal beads (see Table of Materials) and put the sample in the bead mill homogenizer (see Table of Materials) at 4 °C. Ensure that the tube caps are tightened and the samples are balanced inside the homogenizer.\nHomogenize the sample at the highest speed (setting 12) for 4 min.\nRemove the sample from the beads and place it into a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Alternatively, a magnet provided with the homogenizer can be used to remove the beads from the sample.\nSpin down the extract at 19,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C to clarify the protein extract.\nTransfer the supernatant into a fresh 1.5 mL tube on ice, while avoiding carry-over of the white, cloudy precipitate that forms on top of the sample. The supernatant is now the clarified extract.\n\tNOTE: Save 10 µL of the clarified extract to determine the total protein concentration.\nUse the extract immediately for the following experiments or flash freeze the extract in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C.\n\tNOTE: The protocol may be paused here. Extracts may be stored at ultralow temperature (-80 °C freezer or liquid nitrogen for ~6 months). Frozen extracts may be thawed once and cannot be refrozen.",
    "Determine the total protein concentration of the extract using a protein concentration assay kit compatible with detergents (see Table of Materials) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\n3. Immunoprecipitation\nNOTE: All the immunoprecipitation steps for extract preparation should be performed on ice or at 4 °C. It is recommended to use 2 mg of total protein for each immunoprecipitation. However, successful immunoprecipitations with 0.8–1 mg of total protein have been performed. Always use fresh or freshly thawed protein extracts. The following protocol is outlined to perform immunoprecipitation from 2 mg of total protein, or a single immunoprecipitation experiment. The amount of beads and antibody may be increased or decreased accordingly for multiple samples or if a different amount of protein extract is used.\nPlace or thaw the protein extract on ice. The sample can be diluted to 10 mg/mL or 5 mg/mL with ice-cold 1x lysis buffer (see Table 1).\nResuspend the magnetic beads by inversion and transfer 150 µL of the 50% beads suspension into a 1.5 mL tube. Magnetize the beads on ice against a magnetic stand for 1 min or until the solution is clear. Discard the supernatant.\nRemove the tube from the magnetic stand and wash the beads in 1x lysis buffer using 2 volumes (i.e., 300 µL) of bead slurry. Repeat the wash 2x for a total of three washes.\nResuspend the beads in 150 µL of ice-cold lysis buffer.\nTransfer 75 µL of the bead slurry to 2 mg of protein extract and incubate at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle agitation. Save the remaining bead suspension on ice for later use.\n\tNOTE: This step is performed to reduce nonspecific protein binding to beads during the immunoprecipitation step.",
    "Place the tube with sample on the magnetic stand on ice for 1 min or until the beads are fully magnetized and the sample is clear. Transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 mL tube; do not disturb the beads. This is the precleared protein lysate. Save 10% of the sample for Western blot analysis.\nAdd 20 µg of affinity purified antibody to the precleared lysate and incubate at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle agitation.\n\tNOTE: The amount of antibody used for immunoprecipitation is specific to the antibody and protein and should be empirically determined to ensure effective immunoprecipitation of the target protein.\nAdd the remaining 75 µL of the prewashed beads suspension (step 3.5) to the antibody/lysate mixture and incubate for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation.\nPlace the tube in the magnetic stand on ice for 1 min or until the beads are fully magnetized and the sample is clear. Save the supernatant for Western blot analysis (optional).\nWash the beads containing the immunoprecipitate 3x in 450 µL of wash buffer (30 mM HEPES, pH = 7.4, 100 mM potassium chloride, 0.1% Triton X, 2 mM magnesium chloride, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT; see Table 1) on ice.\n\tNOTE: Additional washes may be performed if more stringent washing conditions are preferred.\nResuspend the bead pellet in 20 µL of 2x SDS/BME protein gel loading buffer (see Table of Materials) and denature by boiling at 95 °C for 5 min prior to loading onto an SDS-PAGE gel. Alternatively, denatured samples can be stored at -20 °C for several months.\n\tNOTE: A portion of the bead immunoprecipitate can be saved for downstream RNA isolation, if desired.\n4. Western blot detection of IP samples",
    "Load the IP samples onto the SDS-PAGE gel (see Table of Materials). Avoid transferring the beads by placing the IP tubes on the magnetic stand for 1 min prior to aspiration of the sample.\nPerform the Western blotting15,16 and antibody staining16 with the following modifications: dilute the ALG-1 antibody17 1:500 in 5% non-fat dry milk (NFDM); dilute the HRPK-1 antibody2 1:1,000 in 5% NFDM; and dilute the AIN-1 antibody18 1:10,000 in 5% NFDM. Secondary antibodies (see Table of Materials) were used according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nDetect the bands with HRP-based chemiluminescence (see Table of Materials)."
