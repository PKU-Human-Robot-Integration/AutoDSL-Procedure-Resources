  "procedures": [
    "An outline of the entire procedure, described below, for producing multi-slice dopamine movies is summarized in the flow chart in Figure 1.\nPre-PET MR scan\n\tAcquire a structural MR scan on a separate day from the PET scan. The MR scan will provide an anatomical reference for the PET images. Typical acquisition parameters for the structural MRI are: 3D MPRAGE MR pulse sequence with TE = 3.3 msec, flip angle = 7 degrees; slice thickness = 1.0 mm, 0.98 x 0.98 mm pixels.\n\t\nPractice PET/Smoking Session\n\t\tArrange for the subject to practice the smoking motion in the PET scanner either before the scan or, ideally, on an earlier visit to the PET center. This will avoid confusion or discomfort during the actual PET scan. It will also eliminate the novelty of being in the scanner for the first time. Because the Siemens HRRT is a high resolution brain scanner, the tunnel is narrow and there is minimal clearance for the smoker to bring the cigarette to his/her mouth. Although we have a sophisticated system for addressing head motion, it is still advisable to have the smoker practice smoking while trying not to move his/her head.\nPatient Prep\n\t\t\nIV line\n\t\t\tAn IV must be inserted by a registered nurse and readied for later attachment to the pump that delivers the tracer. Tracer will be injected into the patient through an IV line.\nHead Motion Monitor",
    "Affix reflective spheres to the top of the head of the subject. The Vicra head-tracking system's lasers poll the position of reflective spheres at a rate of 20 Hz. The spheres are attached to rigid, cross-shaped \"tool\" and the tool is attached to a Lycra swim cap worn by the subject. A real-time display of the position of the tool should be used by the study personnel to monitor head motion and to make sure that the laser system has an unobstructed view of the tool and is recording the head position continually for later use in image reconstruction.\nPrepare Injection Pump\n\t\t\nProgram the pump with proper infusion paradigm for raclopride To maximize sensitivity of the PET images to dopamine fluctuations throughout the scan, administer the tracer, 11C-raclopride, as an initial bolus followed by a constant infusion. To determine the proper relative amounts of tracer to be delivered in the initial bolus vs. the infusion, we follow the method of Carson et al. 22 to calculate the ratio of dose in the bolus to infusion rate (\"Kbol\" in units of minutes) given knowledge of the impulse response function of 11C-raclopride in humans. The delivery of tracer according to a given protocol is controlled by an in-house computer program that drives a programmable infusion pump.\nStart Air Filter\n\t\tTo eliminate secondhand smoke from the PET suite during the smoking, position the intake of an air-filter (Movex Inc, Northampton, PA) in front of the scanner and above the subject's head. Leave room for a subject to bring the cigarette to his/her mouth during smoking. The filter is turned on prior to the study and is used in all conditions if multiple scans are performed.\nTransmission scan",
    "Acquire a 9 min transmission scan prior to injection of tracer and acquisition of the PET scan. The transmission is acquired to create a 3D map of the linear attenuation coefficient throughout the brain. The attenuation map is used in the reconstruction of emission (PET) images.\nPET Scan\n\t\nStart injection and PET scan\n\t\tA certified nuclear medicine technologist must administer the tracer. Generally, a team of two technologists initiates tracer administration and PET data acquisition simultaneously.\nRating scales at time of smoking\n\t\tAdminister simple questionnaires, orally, to the subject immediately prior to and following smoking. The smoker must rate his/her craving, satisfaction of craving, nicotine high, and feelings of aversion on a scale of 1-100.\nSmoking\n\t\tIn order to capture the dopamine response to a naturalistic smoking experience, instruct the smoker to smoke at his own pace, smoke his own brand of cigarettes, and most important, perform the smoking by himself, rather than have nicotine or the cigarette administered by study personnel. Smokers - who have been abstinent since the previous midnight - smoke two cigarettes in succession. They generally take about 10 min to complete both cigarettes.\nRating scales post-smoking (as mentioned above).\nPost-PET scan\n\t\nComplete scan, send to reconstruction via MOLAR using Vicra data\n\t\tAfter the acquisition is completed, reconstruct the list-mode data (a record of each individual decay event with its time and location) into emission images. The reconstruction algorithm used in our center is an iterative algorithm (Carson, Barker et al. 21) that corrects for motion on the event level using the high-frequency Vicra recordings. Corrections for scatter, attenuation, dead-time, and normalization, scanner geometry, and point-spread-function are also included in the algorithm. The reconstruction produces a dynamic series of 3D PET images at pre-selected time-frames.\nMR pre-processing and MR-PET registration",
    "Use standard algorithms to remove the skull from the subject's MR image 23. The MR must be de-skulled before aligning with PET because most tracers are not taken up by the skull.\nFilter the dynamic PET data with HYPR\n\tApply a variant of the spatial filtering method, Highly Constrained Backprojection (HYPR-LR) to all PET images in a frame-by-frame manner following the work of Christian et al. 8,24. The appeal of HYPR-LR is that it reduces spatial noise without degrading the temporal information at every voxel that we will use to create our dopamine movies.\nAlign PET data to MR template\n\tAlign the PET to the subject's MR data to yield transformation matrix 1. (This is typically done with an image from early in the PET scan.) Register MR data to a standard MR template to yield transformation matrix 2. Combine transformations 1 and 2 to register the HYPR-filtered PET data to the standard template space. The data are now in a standard anatomical space with isotropic voxels (2 mm x 2 mm x 2 mm).\nApply Striatal Mask\n\tRaclopride has sufficient signal to background contrast to be used only in the striatum. This is the area of the brain that is implicated in drug addiction. Following Martinez et al. 25 apply a mask of the pre-commissural striatum (ventral striatum, dorsal caudate, dorsal putamen) to all the PET data in template space.\nVoxel-based fits of two models\n\t\nSelect the dopamine response functions for lp-ntPET",
    "Select response functions that are consistent with possible dopamine responses to the stimulus. By selecting a particular set of response functions, one can constrain the shape and timing of the estimated dopamine responses to curves that are expected for our particular stimulus. For smoking, we expect a unimodal rise and fall of dopamine concentration (a \"gamma-variate\" shaped curve). In the case of smoking at 45 min into the scan, families of response functions with \"take-off\" times of 40 min (to allow for some anticipation) and later are included.\nApply the lp-ntPET model\n\t\tFit the lp-ntPET model to the PET TACs at each individual voxel in the masked region according to the method of Normandin et al. 7. The operational equation of the model is shown in Figure 3a. The integral of the product of the PET TAC with each response function becomes a set of linear basis functions that contribute to the model (see last term in the operational equation). Because lp-ntPET is a linear, basis function-based method for fitting the dynamic PET data, it can be implemented to rapidly estimate both (a) kinetic parameters governing action of the tracer, and (b) a time-profile of relative dopamine concentration change during the scan session, at each voxel.\n\t\t\nCreate WSSR maps",
    "Record the weighted sum of squared residuals (WSSR) map of the fit of lp-ntPET to the data at each voxel (WSSRlp-ntPET) for use, below. Fitting the model at each voxel produces images of the tracer parameters: R1, k2, k2a, and γ. R1 is the relative flow value, k2 is the efflux rate in the reference region, k2a is the apparent efflux rate in the target region, and γ is the magnitude of the dopamine signal. The weighted sum of squared residuals at each voxel can be thought of as an image as well.\nApply the (conventional) Multilinear Reference Tissue Model (MRTM)\n\t\tFit the MRTM model following 9 to the PET time-activity data at each individual voxel in the masked region. MRTM is a linear model - typically applied to dynamic PET data - that is identical to lp-ntPET except that it lacks a time-varying dopamine term. Fitting MRTM to voxel-wise data yields estimates of only three parametric images: R1, k2, k2a. Record the weighted sum of squares map of the fit of MRTM (WSSRMRTM) to the data at each voxel as well.\nCalculate an F-map\n\tCreate an F-map from the sum of squares maps by calculating the F-statistic at each voxel in the mask. The F-statistic compares the WSSRlp-ntPET to the WSSRMRTM, correcting for differences in degrees of freedom in the respective fits.\nThreshold the F-map\n\tThreshold the F-map at a value that translates to a probability of p < 0.05 (based on degrees of freedom in the model fits). The threshold is the same at every voxel. Binarize the map to make a new \"Significance Mask\" that retains only those voxels in the striatum whose PET TACs are fit (statistically) better with the lp-ntPET than with MRTM.\nFilter the Significance Mask",
    "Perform a morphological \"opening\" (erosion followed by dilation) on the Significance Mask to eliminate tiny, isolated clusters of voxels that we assume to be due to noise. An isotropic 2 x 2 x 2 voxel kernel is used to remove isolated groups of voxels with diameters of 2 voxels or smaller. We now have a Final Significance Mask.\nCreate 4D dopamine movie in color\n\tStore the value of the estimated dopamine curve normalized by k2a at each voxel in the Final Signifcance Mask. These data constitute \"normalized dopamine images\" and will be 4-dimensional. They are, effectively, the relative dopamine value at each time-point for each voxel found to have a significant dopamine response to the stimulus. Create a color-coded image series by applying a color lookup table to the normalized dopamine images. Overlay the color-coded dopamine images on the corresponding MR template image. Save the series of color-coded images as a *.png file. This is a single-slice \"dopamine movie\". Arrange the dopamine movies for each slice containing ventral striatum into one movie. This arrangement is a multi-slice dopamine movie.\nAnalyze smoking data and control data similarly\n\tPerform the same analysis on data from every experimental condition to be examined. For this project, we acquired and analyzed data for each subject in two separate conditions: smoking and control (no smoking).\nCompare smoking to control by constructing a composite dopamine movie\n\tProduce dopamine movies for the same subject in different conditions, e.g. baseline or sham task vs. smoking. Produce a \"composite dopamine movie\" for one subject for all slices of the striatum for baseline and smoking.\nRun the movie\n\tPlay the \"multi-slice dopamine movie\" (shown in results) to reveal spatial and temporal patterns that comprise the brain's unique dopaminergic response to smoking cigarettes."
