    "This protocol involves a surgical procedure in laboratory mice. All animal experiments must be individually reviewed and approved by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). As the approach is based on animal recovery and survival, ensure appropriate anesthesia, pain management, and an aseptic surgical environment at all time. Use a heating pad to prevent hypothermia during surgery and until recovery from anesthesia.\n1. Starting Considerations\nDepending on the virus used, different titer requirements may apply; dilute the virus accordingly.\n\tNOTE: In this example, an Adeno-associated virus diluted in PBS is injected at a titer of 1 x 1012 IU/mL. The virus has serotype 9 and contains guide RNA to Pten and expression of Cre protein under a ubiquitin promotor (Figure 1). Loss of Pten increased pAKT and proliferation of the prostatic epithelium13.\nUse male mice at an age of 8 weeks at the time of surgery to ensure adequate prostate development.\n\tNOTE: Mice shown in this experiment are Rosa26-LSL-Cas9-EGFP knockin mice on C57BL/6J background12 (Figure 1).\nFreshly prepare a general anesthesia mix and if possible keep it sterile.\n\tNOTE: For better animal recovery after surgery, an anesthesia antidote is highly recommended.\n\t\nTo prepare a total volume of 5 mL anesthetic, mix 0.15 mL medetomidine hydrochloride (1 mg/mL), 0.4 mL midazolam (5 mg/mL), and 0.25 mL butorphanol (10 mg/mL) with 4.2 mL sterile saline water.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternative anesthesia methods, such as inhalable isoflurane, can be used according to the institutional animal care guidelines.\nTo reverse the effect of medetomidine hydrochloride post-surgery, mix 0.1 mL atipamezole (5 mg/mL) with 4.9 mL sterile saline water.\nPrepare an aseptic surgical environment by proper disinfection and sterilization. Autoclave surgical instruments before use.\n2. Virus-delivery to the Murine Prostate",
    "Anesthetize the animal by intraperitoneal injection with a sterile 1 mL syringe and a 27G x ½\" needle. Use an anesthesia dose of 0.01 mL/g body weight. If the procedure lasts longer than 30 min, maintain anesthesia by injecting 1/3 of the starting dose every 30 min.\nExamine the anesthetic depth by assessing muscle relaxation, pedal withdrawal, and palpebral reflexes. When loss of reflexes is observed, shave the lower abdomen of the animal.\nCarefully cover the animal's eyes with veterinary ophthalmic ointment using a sterile cotton swab to prevent blindness due to lack of corneal reflex.\nWipe the shaved abdomen with 70% ethanol and 10% povidone iodine to disinfect the surgical area. Scrub the surgical area from the center of the surgical area toward the periphery. \nPerform a vertical skin incision at the low-abdominal midline of approximately 1 cm using a sterile surgical scissor.\nLift the peritoneum using a fine point forceps to prevent damaging the organs that are laying underneath. Carefully make an < 8 mm incision using surgical scissors through the peritoneum.\n\tNOTE: In contrast to human, a rodent's prostate gland comprises four separate lobes. The anterior lobe is attached to the seminal vesicle.\nGently move the fat tissue aside to uncover the seminal vesicle. Using a ring forceps, carefully lift up the seminal vesicle until the anterior prostate can be identified (Figure 1).\nInject a total volume of 30 µL virus (3 x 1010 viral particles) solution in the anterior prostate epithelium using a 0.5 mL insulin syringe with a 30G x 8 mm needle. Minimize leakage and ensure the fluid is absorbed within the tissue, forming a small bubble. Place the seminal vesicle back in the abdominal cavity.",
    "Suture the peritoneum with 2-3 simple interrupted stitches using 6-0 absorbable sutures with a 13 mm, 3/8 circle, and a taper point needle.\nStaple the skin with 3 sterile 4.8 x 6.5 mm clips lifting the skin with forceps to avoid damaging the peritoneum.\nFor better recovery, apply the anesthesia antidote in a dose of 0.01 mL/g body weight by intraperitoneal injection using a sterile 1 mL syringe and a 27G x ½\" needle. Carefully place the animal back in its cage.\n3. Post-surgery Procedures\nKeep the cage with mice that underwent surgery on a heating pad for 1 h after the procedure, to prevent hypothermia until fully recovered. If the antidote is applied, the animal should be awake a few minutes after the injection.\nMonitor the animals daily for appropriate wound healing and pain indications. If necessary, administer additional pain killers according to institutional animal care guidelines.\nRemove skin clips after 4-5 days, once the wound is closed.\nSubscription Required.
