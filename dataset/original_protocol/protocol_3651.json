    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe timing for each step is calculated for the preparation of one 10-plex mass-spectrometry sample (10 separate treatment channels, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/576-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Ligandability profiling using scout fragments or stereoisomeric electrophiles\n(A) Extended experimental workflow for chemical proteomic experiments measuring covalent electrophile-cysteine interactions in primary human T cells using isobaric tandem mass tags for mass differentiation and MS3-based quantification (TMT-ABPP).\n(B) Schematic representation of several major steps in the protocol: (1) Protein precipitation after alkylation step; (2) TMT-tags used for peptide labeling and mass-differentiation; (3) 96-well plate used for high pH fractionation highlighting the wells that get combined into separate fractions; (4) IP2 analysis parameters for static and differential modifications.\nSample preparation and treatment\nTiming: 4 h\nThis step involves preparation of the proteome, treatment with the broad cysteine-reactive desthiobiotin-containing chemical probe (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]), reduction and alkylation of free unreacted thiols.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/576-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Chemical probes used in TMT-ABPP experiments to evaluate cysteine reactivity and ligandability\nStructures of electrophilic scout fragments (A) and broad reactivity probe (B) targeting cysteine. IA-DTB - Desthiobiotin polyethyleneoxide iodoacetamide.\nThaw the cell pellets on ice (calculate the amount of cells that will yield >1 mg of proteome), re-suspend in cold PBS (550–600 μL) and lyse by sonication (probe sonicator, 2 × 8 pulses, 40% duty cycle, output setting = 4).\nNormalize protein concentration to 1.5–2.0 mg/mL using a standard DC protein assay (Bio-Rad).\nOptional: Separate soluble and particulate proteomic fractions by ultracentrifugation (100,000 g, 45 min).\nOptional: Treat total proteome, soluble or particulate fractions with scout fragments KB02 or KB05 (Backus et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) (500 μM final concentration) for 1 h at ambient temperature for broad ligandability analysis.",
    "Treat the resulting proteomes (500 μL, 1.5–2.0 mg/mL) with iodoacetamide polyethyleneoxide desthiobiotin (IA-DTB (Santa Cruz), 5 μL of 10 mM stock in DMSO, final concentration: 100 μM) for 1 h at ambient temperature.\nCritical: IA-DTB is light sensitive, but can be stored for several months as DMSO aliquots at −80°C in the absence of light in amber 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes.\nAdd ice-cold MeOH (600 μL), CHCl3 (100 μL), and H2O (100 μL), vortex the mixture and centrifuge (10,000 g, 10 min, 4°C) to afford a protein disc at the interface of CHCl3 and aqueous layers (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nAspirate both layers without perturbing the disk.\nCritical: if the disk does not form properly, aspirate just the top layer.\nAdd cold methanol (1 mL) to the disk and vortex. Pellet the proteins (10,000 g, 10 min, 4°C), and re-suspend the resulting pellets in 90 μL of buffer containing 9M urea, 10 mM DTT and 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (1/20 dilution of 1.0 M stock solution, pH 8.5) by thorough pipetting up and down or sonication.\nCritical: Avoid having excessive formation of bubbles, a cloudy solution is acceptable at this stage.\nHeat the resulting mixture at 65°C for 20 min, then cool the sample to room temperature.\nAdd iodoacetamide (10 μL, 500 mM solution in H2O), and incubate the samples in the dark at 37°C for 30 min with shaking.\nCritical: DTT and IA should be stored at 4°C and the stock solutions in water should be made fresh on the day of the experiment.\nTrypsin digestion and streptavidin enrichment\nTiming: 5 h\nThis step describes trypsin digestion of the proteins, streptavidin enrichment of desthiobiotin-containing peptides, and elution of the enriched peptides from streptavidin resin.",
    "Following the labeling with iodoacetamide, dilute the samples with 305 μL of Buffer A (TEAB buffer, 50 mM, pH 8.5) to afford a 2.0 M final urea concentration, add trypsin (4 μL of 0.25 μg/μL trypsin in trypsin buffer, containing 25 mM CaCl2), and digest the proteins at 37 ˚C for 2 h.\nCritical: Dilution of urea to 2.0 M concentration is critical to ensure proper enzymatic activity of trypsin.\nPause Point: The tryptic digest step can be performed overnight in a 37°C incubator with agitation.\nThe following day, dilute the samples with 2× wash buffer, 400 μL, 50 mM TEAB, pH 8.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2% NP-40), add streptavidin-agarose beads (50% slurry in 2× wash buffer) to each sample (50 μL/sample) and rotate the bead mixture for 2 h at rt.\nFor a 10-plex sample, wash streptavidin-agarose bead slurry in 2× wash buffer (550 μL, 50% slurry; 2 × 1 mL, 50 mM TEAB, pH 8.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP-40) and bring up to the initial volume in the 2× wash buffer prior to the addition to the sample.\nAfter incubation, pellet the beads by centrifugation (2,000 g, 1 min), transfer the beads to BioSpin columns and wash (3 × 1 mL wash buffer, 3 × 1 mL PBS, 3 × 1 mL H2O).\nElute the peptides by addition of 300 μL of 50% aqueous CH3CN containing 0.1% FA.\nEvaporate the eluate to dryness using SpeedVac vacuum concentrator.\nCritical: Excessive washes of the beads after the enrichment step are critical for removal of non-specific binding peptides, which detrimentally affect the coverage of labeled peptides.\nPause Point: The samples can be stored at −20°C or −80°C for several months.\nTMT tag labeling\nTiming: 2 h",
    "Re-suspend the peptides in 100 μL Buffer B (200 mM EPPS, pH 8.0) with 30% CH3CN, vortex and spin down (2,000 g, 1 min).\nAdd TMT tags (3 μL/channel in dry CH3CN, 20 μg/μL; Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) to the corresponding tubes and allow the reaction to proceed for 60 min.\nQuench the reaction by the addition of 5% hydroxylamine (3 μL per sample), vortex, spin down, and leave at room temperature for 15 min.\nAdd FA (5 μL, Final concentration: 5% v/v) to each tube, vortex the tubes, spin down and combine all of the labeled channels in a single low binding 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nDry the final combined sample in a SpeedVac vacuum concentrator and keep at −80°C until the desalting and high pH fractionation step.\nNote: The dry sample will look like viscous oil due to the presence of salts that will be removed in the following step.\nCritical: TMT tags can decompose over time. Re-suspend the solid tags in dry acetonitrile and avoid storing them at room temperature for prolonged time, as well as extensive number of freeze/thaw cycles. Avoid using Tris buffer, as TMT tags are unstable in the presence of primary amines.\nDesalting and high pH fractionation\nTiming: 3 h\nIn this step the sample is desalted and fractionated to afford better LC/MS separation at the stage of the mass-spectrometry analysis.\nRe-suspend the samples in solvent A (1 mL, 95% H2O, 5% CH3CN, 0.1% FA), acidify with 20 μL of 20% FA in H2O, and desalt by passing through Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (55–105 μm, Waters) to avoid loading excessive salts on the HPLC column (300Extend-C18, 3.5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm).\nCondition the cartridge with CH3CN (3 × 1 mL);\nEquilibrate the cartridge with solvent A (3 × 1 mL);",
    "Load the sample by dropwise addition and wash the cartridge with the flow-through from the sample (1 × 0.5 mL);\nDesalt by passing solvent A (3 × 1 mL);\nElute the peptides by adding 1 mL of solvent B (80% CH3CN, 20% H2O, 0.1% FA);\nEvaporate the eluent to dryness using SpeedVac vacuum concentrator.\nNote: At this stage there should be no visible salts in the Eppendorf tube.\nPause Point: The samples can be stored at −20°C or −80°C for several months.\nRe-suspend the sample in solvent A (500 μL) with sonication and fractionate into a 96 deep-well plate using HPLC (Agilent).\nAdd 20 μL of 20% FA to each well in a 96-well collection plate to acidify the eluting peptides.\nElute the peptides onto a capillary column (ZORBAX 300Extend-C18, 3.5 μm) and separate at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min using the following gradient: 100% Ammonium bicarbonate (Buffer C; 10 mM) from 0–2 min, 0%–13% acetonitrile from 2–3 min, 13%–42% acetonitrile from 3–60 min, 42%–100% acetonitrile from 60–61 min, 100% acetonitrile from 61–65 min, 100%–0% acetonitrile from 65–66 min, 100% buffer C from 66–75 min, 0%–13% acetonitrile from 75–78 min, 13%–80% acetonitrile from 78–80 min, 80% acetonitrile from 80–85 min, 100% buffer C from 86–91 min, 0%–13% acetonitrile from 91–94 min, 13%–80% acetonitrile from 94–96 min, 80% acetonitrile from 96–101 min, and 80%–0% acetonitrile from 101–102 min. Use the following time-based fraction collection: 5–75 min, 96 fractions (collection mode: A1-A12, B1-B12, C1-C12, D1-D12, E1-E12, F1-F12, G1-G12, H1-H12).\nEvaporate the eluent to dryness in the plate using SpeedVac vacuum concentrator.",
    "Re-suspend the peptides in solvent B (80% CH3CN, 20% H2O, 0.1% FA; 75 μL/well) and combine all the wells from each column in the 96-well plate (Columns 1–12 become fractions f1–f12) into a new clean Eppendorf tube (1.5 mL, 12 fractions total, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B), following an additional wash with the same solvent (200 μL/column, washing wells in each row).\nRemove the solvent using SpeedVac vacuum concentrator.\nPause Point: The samples are ready for mass-spectrometry analysis and can be stored at −80°C for several days to months.\nTMT-ABPP liquid chromatography mass-spectrometry (LC-MS/MS/MS) analysis\nThis step describes LC-MS/MS/MS analysis conditions for each proteomic fraction and the Orbitrap Fusion mass-spectrometer settings for the analysis.\nRe-suspend the resulting 12 combined fractions (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) in solvent A (10 or 14 μL, depending on the injection loop size) and analyze on the Orbitrap Fusion mass-spectrometer (5 μL or 10 μL injection volume).\nAnalyze the samples by liquid chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry using an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) coupled to an UltiMate 3000 Series Rapid Separation LC system and autosampler (Thermo Scientific Dionex).\nElute the peptides onto a capillary column (75 μm inner diameter fused silica, packed with C18 (Waters, Acquity BEH C18, 1.7 μm, 25 cm) and separate at a flow rate of 0.25 μL/min using the following gradient: 5% CH3CN (0.1% FA) in H2O (0.1% FA) from 0–15 min, 5%–35% CH3CN (0.1% FA) from 15–155 min, 35%–95% CH3CN (0.1% FA) from 155–160 min, 95% CH3CN (0.1% FA) from 160–169 min, 95%–5% CH3CN (0.1% FA) from 169–170 min, and 5% CH3CN (0.1% FA) from 170–200 min.\nThe voltage applied to the nano-LC electrospray ionization source was 1.9 kV.\nData was acquired using an MS3-based TMT method adapted from Wang, Y. et al.(Wang et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3])",
    "Begin the scan sequence with an MS1 master scan (Orbitrap analysis, resolution 120,000, 400−1700 m/z, RF lens 60%, automatic gain control [AGC] target 2E5, maximum injection time 50 ms, centroid mode) with dynamic exclusion enabled (repeat count 1, duration 15 s).\nSelect the top ten precursors for MS2/MS3 analysis.\nMS2 analysis consisted of: quadrupole isolation (isolation window 0.7) of precursor ion followed by collision-induced dissociation (CID) in the ion trap (AGC 1.8E4, normalized collision energy 35%, maximum injection time 120 ms).\nFollowing the acquisition of each MS2 spectrum, synchronous precursor selection (SPS) enabled the selection of up to 10 MS2 fragment ions for MS3 analysis.\nMS3 precursors were fragmented by HCD and analyzed using the Orbitrap (collision energy 55%, AGC 1.5E5, maximum injection time 120 ms, resolution was 50,000).\nFor MS3 analysis, use charge state–dependent isolation windows. For charge state z = 2, the MS isolation window was set at 1.2; for z = 3–6, the MS isolation window was set at 0.7.\nExtract the MS2 and MS3 files from the raw files using RAW Converter (version 1.1.0.22; available at http://fields.scripps.edu/rawconv/[href=http://fields.scripps.edu/rawconv/]), upload to Integrated Proteomics Pipeline (IP2), and search using the ProLuCID algorithm (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B, publicly available at http://fields.scripps.edu/downloads.php[href=http://fields.scripps.edu/downloads.php]) using a reverse concatenated, non-redundant variant of the Human UniProt database (release-2012_11; SwissProt and Trembl entries were combined and filtered to choose a single protein isoform for each Ensembl gene identifier such that there’s one protein per gene. Reviewed entries (SwissProt) were chosen if available, otherwise the longest Unreviewed (Trembl) entry was used).\nNote: For future applications, newer versions of the database should be generated and used.\nSearch cysteine residues with a static modification for carboxyamidomethylation (+57.02146 Da) and up to one differential modification for the desthiobiotin (DTB) tag (+398.2529 Da) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).",
    "Search the N-termini and lysine residues with a static modification corresponding to the TMT tag (+229.1629 Da).\nTrypsin was selected as the enzyme of choice. Peptides were required to be at least 6 amino acids long, to have at least one tryptic terminus, and to contain the DTB modification.\nFilter ProLuCID data through DTASelect (version 2.0) to achieve a peptide false-positive rate below 1%.\nPerform the MS3-based peptide quantification with reporter ion mass tolerance set to 20 ppm with Integrated Proteomics Pipeline (IP2)."
