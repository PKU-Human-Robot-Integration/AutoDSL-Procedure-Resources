    "Standard curveTo make the standard curve, 1 ml, 2 ml, 3 ml, 4 ml, 6 ml, 8 ml, 10 ml, and 12 ml NO3- standard solution (500 mg/L) is transferred to eight 50 ml flasks respectively, and deionized water is added to each solution to bring the total volume to 50 ml. The concentration of the series of standard solution should be 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 mg/L, respectively. And the molarity of 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 mg/L KNO3 is 0.0007, 0.0014, 0.0021, 0.0029, 0.0043, 0.0057, 0.0071, 0.0086 mol/L, respectively.Transfer 0.1 ml of each standard solution into a 12-ml tube, respectively. Use 0.1 ml deionized water as a control.Add 0.4 ml salicylic acid-sulphuric acid into each tube and mix well, and then incubate all reactions at room temperature for 20 min.Add 9.5 ml of 8% (w/v) NaOH solution into each tube, cool down the tubes (heat is generated due to the reaction) to room temperature (about 20-30 min), and measure the OD410 value with the control for reference.Plot the standard curve with the nitrate concentration as the horizontal axis and the absorbance as the vertical axis. Then, the regression equation can be obtained based on the standard curve (Figure 1). The detailed methods are as follows:Open an Excel, enter the OD410 values in column A and the nitrate concentrations of the standard solutions in column B. Select all the cells containing values, and then insert a scatter plot.Select any data point in the plot, right click, select to add a trend line, choose the linear and display equation, then standard curve and the regression equation are obtained.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170116/20170116185425_6491.jpgFigure 1. Standard curve. The 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 mg/L standard solutions are used to establish a standard curve.",
    "Error bars represent SD of biological replicates (n = 4). According to the standard curve, the regression equation is C (µg/ml) = 140.86 x OD410 - 1.1831, where C stands for nitrate concentration.Nitrate assay in Arabidopsis The seedlings are grown on half MS medium for 7 days (as shown in Figure 2), and the seedlings, shoots, and roots are collected separately for nitrate content determination.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170116/20170116185656_6729.jpgFigure 2. Hydroponic cultivation system for Arabidopsis seedlings. A. Arabidopsis seeds are grown on a gauze net (250 microns mesh size) that has been sterilized by autoclaving. B. The gauze net is placed on a bracket. Make sure that the medium level in the beaker reaches to the gauze net.Freeze each weighed sample (≤ 0.1 g, for example, about 20-25 7-day-old wildtype seedlings grown on half MS) in a 1.5-ml tube by liquid nitrogen, and grind each sample into powder with the frequency of 30/sec for 1 min using a RETCH MM400.Add 1 ml deionized water into the tubes and boil at 100 °C for 20 min (at least).Centrifuge the samples at 15,871 x g for 10 min, and transfer 0.1 ml supernatant into a new 12-ml tube. Use 0.1 ml deionized water as a control.Add 0.4 ml salicylic acid-sulphuric acid into each tube, mix the sample well, and then incubate the reactions for 20 min at room temperature.Add 9.5 ml of 8% (w/v) NaOH solution into each tube and cool down the tubes to room temperature (about 20-30 min). Measure the OD410 value of each sample with the control for reference.According to the OD410 value obtained in the above step, calculate the nitrate concentration (C) with the regression equation, C (µg/ml) = 140.86 x OD410 - 1.1831 obtained in the Procedure A (Figure 1).",
    "Calculate the nitrate content using the following equation: Y = CV/W Where,Y: nitrate content (µg/g), C: nitrate concentration calculated with OD410 into regression equation as step B7 (µg/ml), V: the total volume of extracted sample (ml), W: weight of sample (g)."
