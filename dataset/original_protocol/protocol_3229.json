Once\n            you log in your Benchling account, from the left navigation bar,\n            choose Create>CRISPR>CRISPR Guides.\n          \n            After the target sequence is imported, Benchling will provide a list\n            of guides targeting the region along with both on-target and\n            off-target score based on algorithms for predicting on-target and\n            off-target activities.\n          \n            Then we select the spacer with shortest distance to the editing site\n            and the highest on-target and off-target prediction score.\n            Generally, targeting protospacers more proximal to the desired\n            targeting site yields higher editing efficiency. Therefore, we\n            recommend starting with a protospacer that is positioned as close as\n            possible to the targeting site.\n          \n            We then design the PBS and RT templates of pegRNAs using criteria\n            previously published: PBS range from 8-15nt, RT template range from\n            10-20nt, the first base of the 3′ extensions is not C.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]\nNicking sgRNA design for PE3.\n      For PE3, an additional nicking sgRNA was designed using Benchling CRISPR\n      Design Tool to target to the complementary strand at ∼ 60–100 bp\n      downstream from the pegRNA cutting site.\n    \nAlternatives: other web tools are\n      also available for pegRNA design such as PrimeDesign,6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\n      pegIT7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] and PE-Designer.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]\nScheme 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sch1] shows the design of PE3 editing for the\n      introduction of the N370S mutation in the GBA gene in hPSCs.
