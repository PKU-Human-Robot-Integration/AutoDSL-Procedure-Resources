    "The protocol consists of three major steps: the first step comprises the preparation of composite extract in culture media; the second concerns the Primary Human Gingival Fibroblasts (HGF) cell culture, the contact of cells with the composite extracts and cell staining; the third step consists of confocal imaging and the fluorescent signal analysis. For gingival tissues taking, the protocol was approved in compliance with French legislation, informed consent and local ethical committee.\n1. Composite Extracts Preparation\nUse Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) as the elution medium. Ensure that the ratio between the surface area of the specimens and the volume of extraction medium is at the lowest level of the ISO 10993/12 requirements. The procedure is recently described11 and outlined briefly below:\nForm spherical samples of the uncured dental composite using a bespoke holder. The holder size is 2 mm in radius, which is in accordance with generally advised curing depth in the oral clinical treatment.\nPrepare plate wells, each containing 1 ml of culture medium (DMEM), with a 5% mix of penicillin/streptomycin and 1% of amphotericin but without fetal bovine serum (FBS).\nCure samples within the well containing DMEM medium using a LED light lamp with a 1,070 mW cm-2 intensity (λ = 465-475 nm) for 40 sec. Ensure that the distance between the curing tip and the samples is in the range of 0.5 mm. Use this curing mode to simulate the temporary contact between tooth and the uncured dental composite. In clinical situation, the contact occurs when the restorative composite is placed in the oral cavity.\nIncubate samples (composites specimens in DMEM medium) at 37 °C under humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Incubate DMEM medium (without composite samples) for control cells in the same conditions.\n2. HGF Cell Culture, Composite Extracts Testing and Cells Staining",
    "Growth and maintenance of cell cultures\n\tIsolate human gingival fibroblasts from healthy gingival tissue biopsies of patients taken during routine orthodontic extractions.\n\t\nCultivate human gingival fibroblasts in DMEM in the presence of 10% FBS, 5% Penicillin/Streptomycin and 1% Amphotericin B. Maintain cells at 37 °C in incubator under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air.\nChanged medium every 3 days, and passage cells every 5 days. After reaching confluency, harvest cells by trypsinization.\nCentrifuge cells at 90 x g for 5 min and re-suspend them in the culture medium. Count cell with a scepter handheld automated cell counter.\nSeed cell suspension at a cell density of 2.5 x 104 cells/ml in a chamber slide system. Allow the incubation of cells overnight at 37 °C in a 5% atmosphere.\nAddition of composite extracts to the cells in culture\n\t\nReplace the media of two wells of the chamber slide by 1 ml of the tested composite extracts (after 24 hr of incubation).\nMaintain the two remaining wells (control cells) in the same conditions.\nIncubate the chamber slide containing the four wells at 37 °C in incubator, under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air.\nFluorescent staining\n\tUse the Live/Dead cytotoxicity stain for eukaryotic cells according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\n\tNOTE: the kit provides a quick two-color fluorescent assay to determine viability of cells in a population based on plasma membrane integrity and esterase activity. The stain distinguish live from damaged cells by simultaneously labelling with green-fluorescent Calcein-AM to indicate intracellular esterase activity and red-fluorescent Ethidium homodimer-1 (EthD-1) to indicate loss of membrane integrity.",
    "Prepare a working solution of the two stain reagents containing 2 μM of Calcein AM and 4 μM EthD-1 (final concentration reported to be suitable for fibroblast staining). Add the stain to the cultured adherent cells in the presence or absence of the selected composite extracts.\nObserve directly and rapidly the stained cell populations at the least 15 min after staining and through the time-lapse imaging. Do not centrifuge and do not fixe the stained cells.\n3. Confocal Time Lapse Imaging and Signal Analysis\nThe system used is equipped with a four diode laser units and a multi-stained image for up to four fluorescent dyes for each specimen. The system can perform a mapping image (10X magnification) that gives an overview of the test sample on which one can move to observe a region of interest (600X magnification).\nTime lapse imaging\n\t\nPlace the specimens (the chamber slide containing the stained samples) on the dark room of the confocal integrated incubator (37 °C, 5% of CO2 and humid atmosphere).\nSelect the corresponding lasers. Use the two laser sources 473 nm (15 mW) and 559 nm (18 mW) to excite Calcein and EthD-1.\nUse a two sequential mode to acquire images through line sequences without crosstalk in imaging with the two used fluorescence dyes.\nUse a detector with a newly developed spectrum to automatically set conditions in accordance with the fluorescence dye in scanning unit.\nOptimize the bandwidths of the detected fluorescence for each channel to the maximum. Record all acquisitions sequentially to avoid potential cross-talking.\nSelect the most suitable imaging conditions based on the fluorescent dye selection using the acquisition software.\nAcquire a Map image that is automatically created from the center in a spiral pattern, with the area of interest being easily selected for closer examination.",
    "Select observation mode. Select up to five types of observation modes including time-lapse, Z-stack, and multi-area as needed. Use a combination of Z-stack and time-lapse modes in the present study and complete swiftly the image capturing,\nChange and switch the fluorescent dye. Alternatively, overlay the fluorescent and the light contrast images with each other. Observe live image using the selected point on the left lower map screen.\nDetermine the imaging area by using the framing and zooming functions. Optionally, switch between the displays for each type of fluorescence dye.\n\t\tNOTE: The microscope used in this protocol has the same functionality as a high conventional confocal in a compact design. The microscope is equipped with inverted water-immersion objectives which are optimally suited for stable time-lapse imaging of live cells with a simplified built-in incubator.\nSignal analysis and quantification\n\t\nUse the imaging software to quantify the fluorescence signal. Obtain five map images with the 10X objective for both tested sample and cell control.\nObtained 1,024 × 1,024 pixel regular images, with a 0.231 µm × 0.231 µm pixel size. Store images as Olympus Image Format (OIF) for signal analysis. This format enables storing various parameter settings and images together. Use different analysis tools (measurement of intensity profile, intensity ratio between the two used channels).\nStore the maximal projection images as 12 bits/pixel TIFF files.\nPreform statistical analyses using the R commander software. Analyze differences using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a repetition test. Report results as mean standard deviation (±SD) and statistical significance at p<0.05."
