    "Overall design and engineering of site-directed fluorescent sensorsThis methodology is predicated on locating sites in the primary structure of OM or soluble binding proteins that tolerate Cys substitution and chemical modification with extrinsic fluorophores. Using either crystallographic data or structural models [e.g., from the MODELLER algorithm of CHIMERA (Pettersen et al., 2004)], we predict accessible sites, genetically engineer single Cys residues at those locations, and subject the resulting Cys mutant proteins to labeling with fluorophores. Regardless of the basis of such predictions, the extent of labeling and biochemical functionality of each construct must be experimentally verified. Consequently, for each protein of interest we select 4–6 candidate target residues, mutagenize them to substitute Cys, evaluate their expression, their susceptibility to alkylation with different maleimide fluorophores, and their overall sensitivity to interactions with ligands.Selection of target residues for Cys substitution mutagenesisFor a protein whose tertiary or quaternary structure is fully delineated, we pick candidate residues with side chains that project near its ligand binding site, such that adsorption of a ligand may result in the quenching of an attached fluorophore. For example, Escherichia coli FepA (EcoFepA) binds the siderophore ferric enterobactin (FeEnt) in the loops of its surface vestibule (Smallwood et al., 2014). Its crystal structure (Buchanan et al., 1999) correctly predicted that Cys mutant proteins EcoFepA_S271C and EcoFepA_A698C are accessible to fluoresceination, and then sensitive to FeEnt binding (Smallwood et al., 2014). For Klebsiella pneumoniae IroN (KpnIroN), which is not yet structurally solved but has 82% identity to EcoFepA, we relied on the guideline that >25% sequence identity predicts an identical overall protein fold (Ginalski, 2006; Stokes-Rees and Sliz, 2010). To determine labeling targets in KpnIroN we used CLUSTALW to align it with EcoFepA [PDB sequence 1FEP (Buchanan et al.",
    ", 1999)], and then employed the MODELLER of CHIMERA (UCSF) to predict KpnIroN tertiary structure, including surface loops. This led to the selection and engineering of mutant KpnIroN_T210C, located in L2, that is quantitatively modified by FM (Chakravorty et al., 2019).Cys mutant proteinsAs a general approach, we use PCR to clone a binding protein of interest from the chromosomes of a particular bacterial species. When the sensors originate from E. coli OMPs, we clone the nucleotide sequences encoding their mature proteins and insert them downstream from the native promoter of EcofepA in pITS23 (Scott et al., 2001), which is a derivative of the low-copy pHSG575 (Takeshita et al., 1987). One may generate Cys substitution mutants in proteins by a variety of methods; we use QuikChange mutagenesis (Agilent) of the wild-type genes on pITS23 (Ma et al., 2007), with complementary oligonucleotides flanking the mutation, following the manufacturer’s instructions. After confirming the mutations by sequencing (Genewiz) of purified plasmids, express and fluorescently label the sensor proteins in intact cells, that may be stored frozen at -70 °C. If the desired sensor derives from a soluble binding protein, then clone the relevant structural genes in plasmid pET28a, that adds a 6-histidine (6H)- tag at either the N- or C-termini of the mature protein, and purify it by metal ion affinity chromatography (Talon Superflow, Takara Bio Inc.).Cys mutant protein expression and analysis of fluorescence labelingAlthough other plasmid systems are likely also acceptable, our vector for OMP production, pITS23 (Scott, 2000), carries wild-type EcofepA under control of its native, Fur-regulated promoter. For expression of other E. coli OMP sensors, we precisely replace EcofepA in pITS23 with the alternate OMP structural gene (with its own signal sequence), such that the iron-regulated EcofepA promoter controls biosynthesis of the OM protein.",
    "For OM proteins of other bacterial species, we replace the sequence encoding mature EcoFepA with the sequence encoding the foreign, mature OM protein, downstream from the EcoFepA signal sequence, and regulated by the EcofepA promoter. This approach allows for the EcoFepA signal sequence to direct secretion and assembly of the foreign OMP in the E. coli OM. Next, choose appropriate conditions for high-level expression of the OM sensor proteins of interest. We utilize the E. coli host OKN1359, because its inability to make enterobactin (entA) or to transport iron (∆tonB) leads to overexpression of iron-regulated sensor proteins during growth in iron-deficient MOPS media (Chakravorty et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2022). Additionally, OKN1359 is devoid of several OM proteins (∆fiu, ∆fepA, ∆cir), which facilitates expression of foreign OM proteins. Expose the Cys mutant constructs in situ, in living cells, to FM or other fluorophore maleimides (e.g., coumarin maleimides and Alexa Fluor maleimides; see below). Evaluate the expression and labeling of each cloned OMP by growing bacteria harboring the appropriate plasmid construct in MOPS medium to late log phase (A600nm = 2.5–3.5), and analyze SDS-PAGE resolved samples, or perform immunoblots of bacterial OM or soluble purified protein fractions, to visualize the production and extent of modification of the sensor proteins. For soluble binding proteins, purify a 6H-tagged Cys mutant protein from cell lysate by metal affinity chromatography (e.g., Talon Superflow, Takara Bio Inc), modify it with FM or other fluorophore maleimides, and re-purify the fluorescently labeled sensor by acetone precipitation or gel filtration chromatography.",
    "Fluorescence labelingFor modifications with fluorophore maleimides, inoculate bacteria harboring plasmids that encode a Cys mutant OMP from frozen stocks into LB, grow the strain with shaking (200 rpm) at 37 °C overnight, and sub-culture at 1% into MOPS minimal media with shaking (200 rpm) at 37 °C for 10–12 h, until late exponential phase. Collect the cells by centrifugation at 7,500 × g for 15 min; wash with and resuspend in 50 mM NaHPO4, pH 6.7. Use a micropipettor tip to transfer a small amount of maleimide fluorophore (e.g., FM) powder to 0.5 mL of anhydrous DMF or DMSO, and determine the concentration of this stock solution from its absorbance at 488 nm in 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8 (ϵmM = 80). The stock solution may be stored at -20 °C. Calculate the appropriate dilution factor of the stock, and then label the bacterial cells or purified proteins in 50 mM NaHPO4, pH 6.7, by adding FM to a final concentration of 5 μM, at 37 °C for 15 min. Terminate the labeling reaction by adding β-mercaptoethanol to 140 μM, which instantaneously reacts with excess fluorophore maleimide. After collecting the fluoresceinated cells by centrifugation at 7,500 × g for 15 min, wash with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspend the labeled bacteria in PBS. Immediately use the labeled cells in spectroscopic experiments or rest them on ice (up to 24 h), or add glycerol to 15% and store them (indefinitely) as 1-mL aliquots at -70 °C. In the latter case, after thawing the labeled cells, pellet them by centrifugation in a microfuge, wash them once, and resuspend them in PBS. For evaluation of protein expression or the extent of FM-labeling, solubilize aliquots of the cell suspensions with sample buffer, and subject them to SDS-PAGE (Figure 1).",
    "After electrophoresis, first visualize the extent of labeling with a fluorescence imager (Typhoon 8600GE/Amersham), and then stain the gels with Coomassie blue R (Ames, 1974).Fluorescence spectroscopic binding determinationsWe observe fluorophore-labeled cells in an OLIS-SLM AMINCO 8100 fluorescence spectrometer, upgraded with an OLIS operating system and software (OLIS SpectralWorks, OLIS Inc., Bogart, GA), to control its shutters, polarizers, and data collection. We also utilize an OLIS Clarity fluorescence spectrometer, with the same operating software, for fluorescence assays. For binding determinations, deposit 2.5 × 107 labeled cells in a quartz cuvette (final volume: 2 mL) with stirring at 37 °C, measure the initial fluorescence (F0), and then add increasing concentrations of a ligand, while monitoring the quenching of fluorescence emissions (F) at 520 nm.Step-by-step protocol Grow sensor strains to maximize Cys-mutant OMP expression, or purify soluble Cys-mutant binding proteins.For bacteria, determine cell density from absorbance at 600 nm; for purified proteins, determine the concentration from absorbance at 280 nm.Pellet bacterial cells by centrifugation at 7,500 × g for 15 min and resuspend in the same volume of 50 mM NaHPO4, pH 6.7. Repeat. For soluble binding proteins, dialyze the solution of purified protein (1–5 mg/mL) overnight, using appropriate molecular weight–cutoff tubing or membrane, against 50 mM NaHPO4, pH 6.7.Dissolve ~1 mg of FM in 0.5 mL of anhydrous DMF or DMSO; determine [FM] by measuring the absorbance of a 1/100 dilution at 488 nm in 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8 (ϵmM = 8.1).Expose bacterial cells or purified proteins to 5 μM FM (or other maleimide fluorophore) in 50 mM NaHPO4, pH 6.7, at 37 °C for 15 min, and quench the reaction with 140 μM β-mercaptoethanol.Pellet bacterial cells by centrifugation at 7,500 × g for 15 min and resuspend in the same volume of PBS.",
    "Repeat the centrifugation and resuspend the cells in PBS at ~109/mL; dialyze fluoresceinated soluble binding proteins against PBS overnight, to remove excess fluorophore.Assess the efficacy of covalent modification by diluting aliquots of fluoresceinated cells or proteins in PBS in a fluorometer; analyze with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 520 nm. Calculate the specific fluorescence of the samples (fluorescence intensity/109 cells or /mg protein).Measure the extent of fluorescence quenching by natural ligands.Use, store on ice (up to 24 h), or preserve at -70 °C in 10% glycerol."
