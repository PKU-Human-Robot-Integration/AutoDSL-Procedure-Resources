    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nInduction of anesthesia and fixation of animal in stereotaxic instruments\nTiming: 15 min\nThis step helps the transition from awake state to deep anesthesia in the rats, which makes it easy to fix the rat and reduce pain during the surgery.\nIntraperitoneally (i.p) inject appropriate volume of anesthetics (for adult male SD rats, 5–6 mL/kg body weight is recommended, e.g., 1.5 mL 1% pentobarbital for a 260 g male SD rat, aged 12 weeks) into the rat and put it back to the homecage, wait 5–10 min and check the responsiveness of the rat to nociceptive stimuli (e.g., a pinch of the paw) to make sure that it is in deep anesthesia state. See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1].\nTrim the fur on the head with scissors and disinfect the skin with three rounds application of iodophor disinfectant followed by 75% ethanol.\nNote: The iodophor disinfectant is stable at RT for up to 1 year.\nPlace the rat on the stereotaxis instruments (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/970-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Fix the rat in the stereotaxic instruments\n(A and B) The apparatus (A) and schematic (B) of the rat fixation using the tooth bar, ear bars, and nose clamp.\nFirst, tuck the ear bars into the ear canals loosely but stably.\nSecond, gently move the ear bars toward the center symmetrically.\nThird, fit the up incisors into the tooth bar and slightly tighten the nose clamp.\nFinally, apply eye ointment to protect its eyes from strong illumination of the cold light source as well as to prevent eye dryness.",
    "Critical: Move the ear bars gently to avoid any damages to the skull. The criteria for successful fixation are that the rat head is horizontal to the base plate and vertical to the ear bars, with free up-down rotation while no medial-lateral or front-back movements allowed.\nCraniotomy and determination of skull marks\nTiming: 5 min\nThis step exposes skull marks, including the Bregma and the Lambda, which act as reference points to target the PPi.\nIn order to expose the skull, cut the scalp from the middle of the eyes straight backwards to make a 10 mm incision.\nCritical: The scalp incision might lead to bleeding. When bleeding happens, press the wound with wet cotton for 1–2 min to stop bleeding. Otherwise, skull marks will hardly be visible and the rat can be weak as a result of blood loss. After the stanch, keep the skull moist with sterilized 0.9% saline throughout the surgery.\nClean the exposed skull with sterilized 0.9% saline-immersed cotton swabs, followed by dry cotton swabs to display the Bregma and the Lambda clearly.\nThe Bregma is the cross point of the sagittal suture and the coronal suture.\nThe Lambda is the midpoint of the lambdoid suture’s best-fit curve, usually the cross point of the sagittal suture and the extending tangent line of lambdoid suture.\nMeasure the AP, ML, and DV coordinates of the Bregma and the Lambda with a dissecting microscope (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B). Adjust the tooth bar so that the AP axis and ML axis of the skull were both horizontal to the plate of the stereotaxic instruments.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/970-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Measure the Bregma/Lambda and determine the drilling point\n(A and B) Under a dissecting microscope, the Bregma and Lambda can be clearly observed.\n(C) Set the Bregma as the original point.",
    "(D) Mark the drilling point at (AP, −5.80 mm; ML, +0.05 mm) on the skull exactly above the PPi.\n(E and F) HM1 005 burs are suitable for drilling a bony hole in the SD rat skull.\nThe AP, ML, and DV refer to the anterior-posterior, medial-lateral, and dorsal-ventral axis, respectively.\nThe DV coordinates between the Bregma and the Lambda should not differ beyond 0.05 mm.\nThe DV coordinates 2 mm left and right from the center of midline between the Bregma and the Lambda should not differ beyond 0.02 mm.\nSet the coordinates of the Bregma as the origin of coordinates (AP, 0 mm; ML, 0 mm; DV, 0 mm) (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B and 4C).\nMark and open a bony hole\nTiming: 5 min\nThis step determines the drilling point and removes the skull in the target area.\nRotate the AP and ML modulators to position the needle tip right above the PPi, with the coordinates (AP, −5.80 mm; ML, +0.05 mm) (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B and 4D).\nCritical: Since the position of the pituitary can be changed during dissection, the PPi coordinates provided by the most commonly used brain atlas are not precise enough (Paxinos and Watson, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Swanson, 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Based on the atlas, we modified and optimized the coordinates of the PPi specifically for SD rats weighing about 260 g, which is (AP, −5.80 mm; ML, 0 mm; DV, −10.20 mm). For those weighing 220–300 g, the coordinates need further adjustment. The AP and DV coordinates vary in the range of −5.40 – −6.00 mm and −9.50 – −10.50 mm, respectively. To reduce the risk of sagittal suture damage, we usually adjust the ML coordinate to +0.05 – +0.10 mm, which means the needle tip is 50–100 μm left to the skull midline. See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.3] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.5].",
    "Note: We recommend the PPi coordinate as (AP, −2.90 mm; ML, +0.05 mm; DV, −5.60 mm) in male mice aged 8 weeks, weighing 25 g.\nAlternatives: One might prefer to move the syringe 50–100 μm right to the midline, which makes no difference regarding the labeling efficiency.\nSlowly rotate the DV modulator to lower down the syringe till the tip touches the surface of the skull and mark the point with a thin mark pen under the dissecting microscope.\nUplift the DV modulator to leave space for drilling a bony hole.\nCarefully drill through the skull bone at the marked point with a dental drill (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E and 4F). Drill until the blood vessels beneath the skull are visible, but not to hurt the brain parenchyma.\nCritical: Do not apply downward pressure, the self-gravity of the drill is enough to thin the skull. Drill for some time and then suspend to clean the bony powder with a rubber suction bulb. Drill very slowly and stop immediately when feeling a hit pass. The skull is drilled through and vessels become clearly visible.\nViral loading and infusion into the PPi\nTiming: 25 min\nThis step loads the AAVs to the syringe and infuses appropriate volume of AAVs into the PPi.\nConfigure the withdraw mode of the microinjector to load 1200 nL AAVs at 1200 nL/min (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/970-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Configure the microinjection pump and load the virus\n(A) Configure the pump to withdraw 1200 nL virus at 1200 nL/min.\n(B) Reload 20 nL air into the tip to avoid viral outflow.",
    "Critical: If the 2.5 μl Microliter Syringe (62 RN) has not been preset in the library of the LEGATO® 130 Syringe Pump, customize the syringe definition as 0.343 mm in diameter and 2.5 μL in volume. The final infusion volume is 1000 nL, we recommend that you load an extra 200 nL AAVs to prevent the paraffin liquid being infused into the PPi (see Alternatives below).\nNote: The needle is of point style 3, with 20 mm in length, 0.21 mm in outer diameter, and 0.051 mm in inner diameter.\nAlternatives: Paraffin liquid (500 nL) can be loaded before AAVs to enhance the impermeability of the syringe. The residual paraffin on the outer wall of the needle must be wiped before viral loading. Otherwise, paraffin will damage the brain tissue and contaminate the virus, resulting in decreased transfection efficiency.\nReconfigure the withdraw mode to load an extra 20 nL air into the needle tip (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nCritical: This step helps to maintain a small negative pressure that can prevent the outflow of the virus when the needle goes into the brain tissue.\nClean the outer wall of the needle thoroughly with wet cotton swabs unidirectionally towards the needle tip to remove the residual virus. See troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.7].\nCritical: Given the deep location of the PPi, removing the residual virus is essential to avoid potential contamination along the needle track. It is important to wipe the outer wall unidirectionally in case the needle is accidentally dragged by swabs.\nMove the syringe back to the drilling point (AP, −5.80 mm; ML, +0.05 mm) so that the needle tip is close to the dura.\nPenetrate the dura and slowly lower the syringe until the needle reaches the PPi (AP, −5.80 mm; ML, +0.05 mm; DV, −10.20 mm).",
    "Infuse the virus at a low rate (70–100 nL/min, total 1020 nL including 20 nL air and 1000 nL AAVs) to the PPi. After infusion, maintain the syringe at the position for another 10 min to allow viral diffusion and to avoid viral backflow. See troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.7].\nSlowly uplift the syringe for 50 μm and maintain it for 3 min before full withdrawal.\nUplift the syringe until the needle completely leaves the brain tissue and clean the needle tip after full withdrawal.\nCritical: Cleaning the needle immediately after withdrawal helps avoid potential blockage of the tip by blood clot.\nWipe off the blood and suture the craniotomy after applying drops of antibiotics.\nCritical: During continuous operations of multiple rats, disinfection measures must be taken for each one. Sterilize the surgical area with 75% ethanol wipes and change the diaper for different rats. Clean all the surgical tools with three rounds application of iodophor disinfectant followed by 75% ethanol for every operation.\nNote: A 5-0 medical silk braided suture and a 3/8 needle were used to close the skull skin.\nPerioperative care and viral expression\nTiming: 4 weeks\nThis step ensures that the rat recovers from the surgery and full expression of the virus.\nMonitor the rat in an isolated cage for 24 h before sending it back for normal housing.\nNote: The rats were housed in an individually ventilated caging (IVC) system with high efficiency-particulate air (HEPA) filter to avoid airborne contamination.\nPerform post-operative monitoring of general conditions daily for 3–7 days, including the physiological and behavioral states.\nFood and water intake are most important for the rats to recover. Make sure that the rats eat, drink and eliminate normally. Measure and record post-operative body weight.",
    "Monitor general appearance, grooming, posture and locomotor activity. The rats should be active, alert, and social interacting with cagemates.\nCarefully scrutinize those curling up frequently or behaving like depression, in case there is untreated pain or infection. Examine the rats for surgical sites swelling, inflammation and signs of surgical complications such as pain, paralysis, and seizures.\nWithdraw the suture 7 days after surgery from the wounds.\nAllow the virus to express for 2–4 weeks."
