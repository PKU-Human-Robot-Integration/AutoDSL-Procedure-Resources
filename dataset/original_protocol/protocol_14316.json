    "The presented research has been performed in compliance with all institutional, national, and international guidelines for human welfare. Institutional review board approval has been obtained.\nPosition the patient in supine position on a standard operating table with two separate leg supports. Allow the ipsilateral legs to remain mobile.\nApply standard sterile coverage suitable for the antero-lateral approach in supine position.\nSlightly flex the ipsilateral side using a knee roll. In addition, hyperextend the contralateral side about 15° for the femoral preparation.\nLocate the tip of the greater trochanter as well as the anterior superior iliac spine by palpation serving as orientation.\nPerform the skin- incision using a surgical knife (6 - 12 cm, depending on the patient's anatomy) centered on the tip of the greater trochanter aiming at the anterior superior iliac spine above the intermuscular septum between the gluteus medius and the tensor fasciae latae.\nAfter incision of subcutaneous fat, use two skin retractors anteriorly and posteriorly. Open the fascia without causing damage to the tensor fasciae latae.\nDo a blunt dissection using your index finger, pushing the gluteal muscles posteriorly without damage.\nExpose the joint capsule using three retractors.\nPerform the capsulectomy alongside the femoral neck.\n\tNOTE: No sharp dissection of any muscle, in particular the gluteal muscles, is needed.\nAfter removal of the anterior joint capsule, expose the femoral neck in order to perform the osteotomy by placing the two facing curved retractors intracapsular around the femoral neck (Figure 1).",
    "NOTE: The most important step in the implantation of a calcar-guided short stem is the choice of the individual level of the osteotomy. This way, stem-positioning can be done individually in a great variety, resulting in a large bandwidth of CCD-angles to be reconstructed (Figure 2; Figure 3). Consequently, a preoperative planning is mandatory to display the exact level (Figure 4: red line (OL: level of osteotomy)).\nFor the surgeon's orientation, in order to determine the level of the osteotomy, perform a palpation of the lesser trochanter and the fossa piriformis. If a valgus position is desired according to the preexisting anatomy, perform the osteotomy distally by resecting most of the femoral neck (Figure 5a). In order to align the stem in a varus position, resect proximally, retaining most of the femoral neck, according to the preoperative planning (Figure 5c). Femoral offset and leg length can thus be maintained precisely (Figure 5).\nPerform the osteotomy (Figure 1) in slight external rotation of the ipsilateral leg according to the preoperative planning using a long stiff bladed oscillating saw.\nRemove the femoral head from the acetabulum using the femoral head extractor. To protect the gluteus medius, place a \"Langenbeck\"-retractor medially and pull proximally.\nDuring acetabular preparation, insert a \"Steinmann\"-pin in the proximal end of the acetabulum to protect the gluteal muscles.\nExpose the acetabulum using two extractors.\nImplant the acetabular component according to the preoperative planning and depending on the patient's individual anatomy.\nFor femoral preparation, first remove the knee roll and hyperextend the contralateral leg about 15°. Now perform a 90° external rotation and a maximum of 90° flexion of the knee joint. Have the assistant hold the subject's leg at maximal adduction (about 40°).",
    "Position two retractors on the medial side of the proximal femoral neck and proximally at the posterior (medial) cortical end of the femoral neck. Avoid contact to the greater trochanter, to minimize the risk of possible damage to the bone and the muscle insertions.\nApply the \"round-the-corner\" technique to open the proximal femur alongside the calcar with the curved opening awl.\n\tNOTE: Posterior structures such as the greater trochanter or the gluteal muscles are not affected.\nDrive in gently specially curved, implant-shaped rasps in ascending sizes using a hammer in order to prepare the proximal femur and the femoral canal until cortical contact and a stable fit and fill are reached. Note that a double offset minimally-invasive rasp handle is available. Perform the insertion guided by the calcar in the \"round-the-corner\" technique (Figure 6).\nChoose one of the two available trial cones with different offset versions (standard and lateral offset) according to the preoperative planning.\nAssess an intraoperative fluoroscopy using a digital image intensifier after inserting a trial head and performing a trial reduction to compare the positioning of the rasp (trial implant) to the preoperative planning (Figure 7). Perform an anterior-posterior radiograph. To screen the second plane, also perform an axial view radiograph. Perform adjustments, if necessary.\n\tNOTE: Reaching cortical contact is essential regarding the risk of postoperative subsidence. Avoid undersizing! (Figure 8)\nRemove the trial implants and insert the definitive implant containing the chosen offset version using the special implant impactor. Note that the original stem aligns itself exactly like the trial rasp (Figure 9).\nAfter the final reduction by applying axial tension combined with internal rotation of the leg, complete the procedure by standard wound closure.\nIn most cases, allow full weight-bearing after surgery using 2 crutches under physiotherapeutic surveillance starting 4 h after the operation.",
    "NOTE: In heavy patients, primary stability might be impaired, thus, weight bearing protocol must be adjusted accordingly.\nProvide analgesics according to the intensity of pain recorded, non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs (NSAID) to prevent heterotopic ossification, and venous thromboembolic prophylaxis."
