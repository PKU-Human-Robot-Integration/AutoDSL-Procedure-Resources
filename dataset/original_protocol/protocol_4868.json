    "Extraction of G6PDH from bacterial cellsNote: Bacterial cells and cell-free extracts must be kept on ice or at 4 °C throughout all steps of extraction. Resuspend the cell pellets in 500 μl extraction buffer (Tris-maleate buffer pH 6.8 for cyanobacterial cells or potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.8 for E.coli cells). The extraction buffers keep G6PDH enzyme in an active state.Note: G6PDH of the photosynthetic prokaryotes like cyanobacteria is a redox modulated oligomeric enzyme. In case, redox modulation properties are planned to be tested, β-mercaptoethanol must be omitted from the buffers.To wash glass beads, add 500 μg glass beads and 1 ml extraction buffer to two separate Eppendorf tubes, mix with a whirly mixer well, centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 1 min, and discard the supernatant.Add 500 μl cell suspension to each glass beads containing tubes and mix the tube to resuspend the glass beads.Put the tubes in fast prep FP120 and run the device twice at 5.5 m/sec for 40 sec. Note: This step may be done by mixing the tubes vigorously on a whirly mixer for 1-2 min until most of the cells are disrupted. This may be confirmed by examining a small amount of the crude extract for unbroken cells under a light microscope.Centrifuge the extract at 10,000 x g for 10 min.Transfer the supernatant to a new Eppendorf tube and keep at 4 °C. Use this cell-free extract as enzyme solution.Note: It is better to use the extract immediately. However, the extract may be stored at 4 °C for a week albeit some degree of activity loss. Assay of G6PDH activity in cell-free extractSet the wavelength of spectrophotometer to 340 nm. Select absorbance function.Prepare a blank and a test mixture as follows (Table1).Table 1. Regent contents of test and blank mixturesimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160923/20160923205524_9488.",
    "jpgAdd assay buffer, NADP+ and enzyme solutions first to a 1 ml spectrophotometer cuvette, then, start the enzyme reaction by adding G6P and mix the content by flipping the paraffin sealed cuvette.Note: Assay buffer is Tris-maleate (pH 7.4) for cyanobacteria and Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for E.coli. A blank reaction mixture is needed to check any endogenous NADP+ reduction in enzyme solution. A minimum amount of 200 mg protein per assay is necessary albeit it may vary depending on factors such as growth phase of the culture used.Place the cuvette in the cell holder of the spectrophotometer, close the lid and follow the absorbance for 3-5 min at room temperature by recording absorbance value in 15-30 sec intervals. Temperature of the reaction mixture should be kept at a certain point. Some enzymes need specific temperature like 37 °C. In this case reaction cuvette must be treated with a thermostatic apparatus integrated to the spectrophotometer. However, some enzymes work well at room temperature.Estimate ∆A340 (rate) dividing the total absorbance change to the total assay time in min. For example, if the absorbance change in a reaction mixture at 340 nm is 0.450 after 3 min, the rate is 0.150.Note: Some spectrophotometers have rate measurement function. Using such a device, the rate may be determined directly. Repeat steps B4 to B6 for the blank tube to test whether any detectable endogenous NADP+ is present in the enzyme solution. If so, subtract this value from the test value to find net ∆A340 value.Estimation of unit of activity and specific activity of G6PDHOne of the standard expression ways of enzyme activity is the unit of activity. Unit of G6PDH activity is defined here as the formation of 1 μmol NADPH in one min.",
    "NADP+ reduction (G6PDH activity) determined as rate (∆A340) is needed to be converted to concentration in μmol. Once the unit of activity is determined, it is often converted to specific activity. Specific activity is expressed as units per mg protein.Estimate G6PDH activity in units by using the formula as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160923/20160923205600_3141.jpgIn this protocol the dilution factor is 20 (50 μl extract in 1,000 μl test or blank mixture). For example, if a rate of 0.85 is yielded in the test assay and 0.05 in the blank assay, the net rate will be 0.8. Then the units of activity will be estimated as 0.8 x 20/6.22 = 2.572 μmol min-1 ml-1. To estimate specific activity, the protein amount in the extract must be determined by a standard method such as Bradford assay. Specific activity is then estimated as the amount of units per mg protein by using the formula below: imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160926/20160926220034_2031.jpgFor example, if the protein content of the extract is 0.5 mg ml-1, the specific activity will be 2.572/0.5 = 5.44 units/mg protein."
