    "Glutathione productionAn S. cerevisiae strain was streaked with a disposable loop on the YPD solid medium and grown at 30 °C for 72 h.A single grown colony was inoculated into 5 ml of the YPD liquid medium in a 25 ml glass test tube closed with a tapered plug closure made of silicone sponge. The bacteria were aerobically grown with agitation at 200 rpm for 18 h at 30 °C.Transfer 50 μl of the grown yeast culture into a 1.5 ml microtube. Add 750 μl of ultrapure water and 200 μl of 500 mM EDTA to the 1.5 ml microtube and mix thoroughly by vortexing.Measure OD600 of this diluted yeast suspension in the EDTA solution.To determine OD600 of the original yeast preculture (ODPC), we multiplied the measured OD600 by 20 (dilution factor).The grown cells were inoculated into 20 ml of the YPD liquid medium in a 200 ml baffled Erlenmeyer flask plugged with a silicone sponge closure and were grown at 30 °C with agitation at 150 rpm for up to 48 h (Figure 1). The yeast cell culture volume (ml) for inoculation was calculated using the equation below. In the following equation, 20 and 0.03 indicate the total volume (μl) of the YPD liquid medium used for glutathione fermentation and the initial cell density (OD600), respectively.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180613/20180613205748_7982.jpgThe yeast culture (1 ml) grown in a baffled Erlenmeyer flask was sampled at 24 and 48 h.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180613/20180613205920_3997.jpgFigure 1. Schematic outline of glutathione production. A more detailed procedure is described in Procedure A.Determination of biomass concentrationCultivate yeast under the conditions described in Procedure A.Transfer 50 μl of the yeast culture (grown for glutathione production) into a 1.5 ml microtube. Add 200 μl of 500 mM EDTA and 750 μl of ultrapure water up to the 1.",
    "5 ml label in the microtube and mix thoroughly by vortexing.Measure OD600 of this diluted yeast suspension in an EDTA solution.To determine OD600 of the original yeast culture, multiply the measured OD600 by 20 (dilution factor).Centrifuge (16,000 x g, 10 min) all the yeast culture medium in 50 ml centrifuge tubes.Discard the supernatant and add 20 ml of room temperature ultrapure water to the cell pellet and thoroughly resuspend it by vortexing.Repeat this wash procedure one more time and re-pellet the cells.Add an adequate volume of 100 mM EDTA to the cell pellet to achieve optical density [at 600 nm (OD600) of the cell suspension] of approximately 1.0.Dilute the cell suspension with room temperature 100 mM EDTA to prepare 2-, 4-, 8-, and 16-fold diluted cell suspensions, and measure OD600 of these serial dilutions.Weigh empty open 50 ml centrifuge tubes and centrifuge (16,000 x g, 10 min) 20 ml of these cell suspensions in these tubes. Remove the supernatant and incubate the open centrifuge tube at 80 °C in a forced air flow oven overnight to dry the cells sufficiently.Weigh each 50 ml centrifuge tube with the dry cell pellet and calculate the weight of the dry cell pellet by subtracting the weight of the empty tube from the total weight (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180613/20180613210334_1663.jpgFigure 2.

    "Measurement of cell concentration and cell disruptionTransfer 1 ml of the yeast culture grown for glutathione production in a 1.5 ml microtube. Add 250 μl of 500 mM EDTA to the 1.5 ml microtube and mix thoroughly by vortexing.Transfer 50 μl of this yeast culture containing 100 mM EDTA into a fresh 1.5 ml microtube. Add 950 μl of ultrapure water into the 1.5 ml microtube and mix thoroughly by vortexing.Measure OD600 of this diluted yeast suspension in the EDTA solution.To determine OD600 of the original yeast culture (ODC), multiply the measured OD600 by 25 (dilution factor).Centrifuge (16,000 x g, 1 min) 1.2 ml of the residual yeast culture in a 100 mM EDTA solution and resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of ultrapure water by vortexing.Repeat this wash procedure one more time and re-pellet the cells.Add an adequate volume (μl) of ultrapure water calculated by means of the equation below for the cell pellet and resuspend it well. In the following equation, 960 and 35 mean residual yeast culture volume (μl) without the EDTA solution, and OD600 that is optimal for glutathione determination, respectively.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180613/20180613221153_8615.jpgTransfer 980 μl of distilled water and 20 μl of the concentrated yeast cell suspension to a different 1.5 ml microtube and mix thoroughly.Measure OD600 of this diluted yeast cell suspension and multiply the measured OD600 by 50 (dilution factor) to obtain OD600 of the concentrated resuspended cells (ODR).To disrupt yeast cells, incubate the concentrated cell suspension at 95 °C for 3 min and then cool on ice for 3 min.Centrifuge (16,000 x g, 10 min) the disrupted cell suspension, and transfer 50 μl of the supernatant (solution containing cell content) to a new 1.5 ml microtube. The cell content solution can be stored at -20 °C before HPLC analysis (Figure 4).",
    "At least three samples per strain are needed for accurate measurements.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180613/20180613221412_5470.jpgFigure 4. Schematic outline of measurement of cell concentration and cell disruption. A more detailed procedure is described in Procedure C.HPLC analysisAdd 200 μl of the HPLC mobile phase to 50 μl of the cell content solution.Filter the 5-fold diluted cell content solution through the filter unit with 0.22 μm pore size to obtain an HPLC sample.Set each parameter as follows.Pump: run time, 25 min; flow rate, 1 ml/min; maximum pressure, 20.0 MPa.UV detector: deuterium arc lamp was used, response, 1.0 sec; internal temperature, 40 °C; wavelength, 210 nm.Column oven: temperature, 30 °C; maximum temperature, 40 °C.Auto sampler: injection volume, 20 μl; syringe speed, 15 μl/sec; flush volume, 200 μl; needle stroke, 52 mm; flush speed 35 μl/sec; temperature 10 °C.Equilibrate the column to allow the mobile phase to flow for at least 90 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min.Start analysis according to the HPLC manual to quantify reduced and oxidized glutathione in the HPLC sample. Examples of HPLC analysis are shown in Figure 5.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180613/20180613221643_7786.jpgFigure 5. Examples of HPLC analysis. A.
