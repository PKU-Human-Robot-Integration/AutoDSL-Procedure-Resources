    "The examples shown here are from experiments approved by IACUC at Georgia Regents University - Protocol No: # 2011-0408\n1. Preparation of Reagents\nPrepare dissection solution stock: For 500 ml of stock dissection solution (5x), dissolve 21.18 g NaCl, 0.875 g KCl, 0.739 g MgSO4, 1.049 g MOPS and 0.019 g EDTA in 450 ml of Milli-Q water. Adjust pH to 7.3-7.4 using 1 N NaOH. Make up the volume to 500 ml with Milli-Q water. Stock solution can be stored up to 7-10 days. See Table 1 for a list of chemicals and their vendors. See Table 2 for concentration in mM.\nPrepare working dissection solution: Prepare fresh working dissection solution every day. For 100 ml working solution, dissolve 0.091 g glucose, 0.016 g NaH2PO4 and 0.022 g sodium pyruvate in 79.8 ml of Milli-Q water. Add 0.2 ml 1M CaCl2 and 20 ml dissection solution stock to bring volume to 100 ml.\nPrepare physiological salt solution (PSS): To prepare 1,000 ml PSS, dissolve 0.365 g KCl, 6.545 g NaCl, 0.296 g MgSO4, 0.163 g KH2PO4, 2.072 g glucose, 2.184 g NaHCO3 and 2.383 g HEPES in 950 ml of Milli-Q water. Adjust pH to 7.3-7.4 using 1 N NaOH. Make up the volume to 1,000 ml with Milli-Q water. Remove 2 ml of solution and replace it with 2 ml of 1 M CaCl2. (Fresh PSS needs to be prepared daily)\nPrepare calcium (Ca2+) free PSS: For 100 ml PSS without Ca2+, dissolve 0.036 g KCl, 0.654 g NaCl, 0.029 g MgSO4, 0.016 g KH2PO4, 0.207 g glucose, 0.218 g NaHCO3, 0.238 g HEPES, 0.015 g EGTA and 0.0026 g Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) in 95 ml of Milli-Q water. Adjust pH to 7.3-7.4 using 1 N NaOH. Make up the volume to 100 ml with Milli-Q water.",
    "2. Preparation of Glass Cannulas\nPull glass pipettes to generate the 100-150 μm tipped cannulas using a pipette puller as per manufacturer's guidelines.\nBevel the glass cannula tips using a microelectrode beveller, fire polish them and bend the glass cannula tips by ~45° using a heater probe.\nLoad the cannulas into micropipette holder and attach the micropipette holder on to the perfusion chamber.\n3. Preparation of Perfusion Chamber\nRinse perfusion chamber with Milli-Q water followed by dissection solution for 5 min each. Load the chamber with 2 ml of dissection solution.\nSuction dissection solution through cannula using 10 ml syringe and fill carefully the entire cannula and the attached tubing without any bubbles. Apply suction gently to prevent generation of bubbles.\nPrepare two sutures with a half-knot each using blunt forceps. Since ophthalmic monofilament nylon sutures (10-0, 0.2 metric) are used to prepare the knots that are only 1-2 mm in diameter, dissection microscope may be needed.\nVisualizing under dissection microscope, use dissection forceps to load both cannulas with partially closed suture knots slightly away from the tip. Later these knots will be slid carefully onto the cannulated arterial ends and closed completely.\n4. Collection of Mesenteric Artery Arcade from Sprague-Dawley Rats\nSeek approval of the local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) before conducting these experiments. House animals in the animal facility with controlled temperature and lighting and allow free access to water and a commercial rodent chow.\nAnesthetize rats by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). Confirm deep anesthesia by toe-pinch and if needed administer additional anesthetics.\nAfter confirming the surgical anesthesia, euthanize the animal by decapitation. Follow AAALAC guidelines for utilizing appropriate methods for animal euthanasia.",
    "Use a dissection scissor and a forceps to perform a mid-line laparotomy from pelvis to sternum. This is done in two steps: first, incise the skin and second, incise the underlying muscle layer. Care must be taken not to injure the intra-abdominal organs.\nCut the proximal end of intestine close to the pylorus and the distal end close to the ileo-cecal junction. Tie both ends separately to prevent leak of chyme and feces thus avoiding contamination of extracellular bathing solution. Incise the mesentery at its base near the feeding vasculature i.e., superior mesenteric artery and transfer the entire small intestinal mesenteric bed to a 50 ml beaker containing ice-cold dissection solution.\nAllow harvested tissue to stay in ice cold dissection solution for 5 min and rinse with fresh dissection solution to get rid of blood.\n5. Isolation and Cannulation of 4th Order Mesenteric Artery\nPin down the proximal end of the intestine on the right hand side in a sylgard-coated dish. Extend the remaining intestine in a counter clockwise path, pinning the segment down to spread the mesentery and exposing the blood vessels (Figure 1). Note: We isolate arterial segments at room temperature. Otherwise we place the mesenteric arcade containing dish on ice. Some labs, including those at our institution, use chiller units to dissect arteries at 4 °C.\nUnder a stereo zoom microscope dissect out 3rd and 4th order small mesenteric arteries (~260 μm) parallel to the small intestine using small scissors. First dissect away all the covering fat. Then dissect out the vein and isolate the artery with V-shaped branch point. Be careful not to puncture the selected segment. Start dissecting the fat near a 2nd order branch and find the way to 3rd or 4th order vessels.",
    "Note: Arteries and veins can be distinguished based on their wall thickness - arterial wall is thicker than vein's. Moreover, when adjoining connective tissue is pulled gently perpendicular to the vessels, veins collapse readily while arteries don't. Since arteries with lumen diameter <400 μm are major sites of systemic vascular resistance, for this protocol we used 4th order rat mesenteric arteries (lumen diameter <300 μm).\nIsolate a 4-5 mm section of artery parallel to the small intestine. Visualize all the 5th order branches embedding into small intestine and cut them slightly away from the origin of branches and preserve a portion. These preserved portions of branches serve as holding sites (with dissection forceps) for transferring arterial segments to a perfusion chamber and, subsequently guide their cannulation.\nThen cut the arterial segments by making 2 incisions distal to the 5th order branches on each side of the artery and transfer it to the perfusion chamber (see Figure 1C and legend).\nCannulate one end of the vessels on one of glass micropipette (diameter: 100-150 μm) using dissection forceps by holding the tips of the arterial segment with dissection forceps. Slide the previously loaded partially closed suture onto the cannulated end and secure it. Note: Proximal end of the artery may be cannulated onto the glass cannula that is connected to servo-controlled pressure-regulating device to mimic in situ environment.\nAttach a dissection solution loaded 10 ml syringe to the stopcock connected to this cannula such that dissection solution in the tubing connecting the cannula and stopcock merges with that in the syringe. Gently raise the syringe. The gravitational force on the solution will remove the intra vascular blood from the open end of the vessel. After removing the intra-arterial blood, close the stopcock.",
    "Note: Alternatively, attach the stopcock to the pressure controller, turn it on and gently increase the pressure to 5-10 mm Hg to achieve the same result.\nTie the distal end of the vessels onto a second glass cannula by carefully bringing the other cannula as close as possible to the untied end of the arterial segment. Slide the previously loaded partially closed suture onto the cannulated end and secure it. Care must be taken not tug or pull on the arterial segments. Make sure that stopcocks attached to both cannulas are closed.\nTransfer perfusion chamber on to the stage of inverted microscope equipped with live video recording.\nConnect the stopcock of cannula tied to the proximal end of arterial segment to a servo-controlled pressure-regulating device and make sure that stopcock attached to the other cannula remains closed to maintain stable intraluminal pressure.\nNext, attach the vacuum tubing to the suction port and the perfusion tubing to the perfusion port of the chamber.\n\tNote: Beveled needle port is used for suction and blunt needle port for perfusion.\nStart perfusion of vessel with warm PSS through single inline solution heater (37 °C, equilibrated with gas mixture: 5% CO2, 5% O2 and 90% N to maintain neutral pH and adequate oxygenation17) at 2 ml/min using a peristaltic pump. Turn the vacuum on as well. Place a thermistor in the chamber to monitor temperature continuously.\nAs the temperature of PSS in the chamber nears ~37 °C (usually within 5 min), slowly increase intraluminal pressure from 20 to 100 mmHg and check vessels for leaks. This is done using the automatic pressure setting of pressure regulator. Discard vessels with leak and replace with another segment. The vessels with leaks will not be able to hold the pressure.",
    "Assess the arterial segment for bends while maintaining the pressure at 100 mmHg. Using the screw-lever, move the cannula to straighten the arterial segment. Do not over stretch the arterial segments; the goal is to mimic in vivo arterial segment length.\nReduce the pressure to 70 mmHg (to mimic in vivo pressure in the mesenteric arcade18) and allow the arterial segment to stabilize and develop myogenic tone. Arteries may be pressurized variably (40-70 mmHg) according to experimental strategy and vascular bed. A previously published review provides an excellent review of variability in MT in arterial segments from different vascular beds8.\n6. Measurement of Arterial Diameter\nView arteries at 10X objective on a microscope equipped with a monochrome video charge-coupled device camera. Measure luminal diameter using video frame grabber and real-time edge-detection system. A list of equipment used is provided in Table 3.\nMonitor and record vessel diameter continuously.\nObserve for development of MT. Note: We observed that in rat mesenteric resistance arteries, at 70 mmHg, development of MT is characterized by ~20% decrease in diameter. MT varies according to vascular bed and animal species.\nConfirm vascular viability by assessing vasoconstrictor and vasodilator responses to 1 μM phenylephrine (Phe) and 1 μM acetylcholine (ACh).\nAt the end of each experiment, determine passive diameter (PD) by incubating arteries in Ca2+-free PSS for 20 min.\n7. Myogenic Response\nReduce the pressure to 20 mm Hg and allow the diameter to stabilize. Increase the intraluminal pressure in incremental steps (20, 40, 60, 80 and 100) and at each pressure step allow arteries to achieve a stable diameter (usually within 5 min).\nReduce the intraluminal pressure to 20 mmHg and incubate the arterial segment in Ca2+-free PSS containing 0.39 mM EGTA and 0.1 mM SNP. Allow the arterial diameter to stabilize (usually 15 min).",
    "Repeat the pressure-step response in Ca2+-free PSS containing 0.39 mM EGTA and 0.1 mM SNP.\n8. Interpretation of Results and Calculation Of Data\nCalculate the MT as the percent difference in diameter observed for Ca2+-containing versus Ca2+-free PSS at each pressure according to following calculation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50997/50997eq1.jpg\nFor arteries undergoing vasomotion the diameter may be calculated by averaging the plateau phase for 1 min. Express the collected data as percent of maximal relaxation (%PD) according to the relationship: %PD = 100 x [ΔD/PD]; ΔD is the difference between the diameter before and after addition of any investigational compound (e.g. Phe); PD is passive diameter (also the maximal diameter).\nSubscription Required.
