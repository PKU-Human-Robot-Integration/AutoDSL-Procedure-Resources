    "1. Synthesis of Magnetite Gel\nWash all glassware by using concentrated hydrochloric acid followed by deionized water followed by ethyl alcohol. Allow to dry O/N, preferably in a drying oven.\n\tCAUTION! hydrochloric acid is harmful – wear personal protective equipment and work in a fume hood; ethyl alcohol is harmful – wear personal protective equipment.\nUse a Dreschel bottle to de-gas 500 ml of deionized H2O by gently bubbling N2 gas for 30 mins.\nSet-up the magnetite synthesis apparatus within a chemical fume hood.\n\t\nPlace a 500 ml three-neck round-bottom flask within an isomantle heater and secure the center neck using a clamp and stand.\nInstall a rubber septum into one of the round-bottom flask’s side necks and a reflux condenser with a rubber septum into the remaining side neck. Continuously run cold water through the reflux condenser.\nPuncture the round-bottom flask’s rubber septum with a needle connected to an N2 gas line and puncture the reflux condenser’s rubber septum with a needle connected to a gas line running to a bubbler (i.e., flask with water) to visualize gas outflow.\nInstall a blade paddle into the round-bottom flask’s center neck via a paddle adapter. Attach the blade paddle’s shaft to an overhead stirrer mounted onto a stand.\nPurge the round-bottom flask with N2 gas and leave N2 gas flowing at a low but detectable rate.\nRemove the reflux condenser from the round-bottom flask and add 1.000 g of iron(III) chloride, 0.6125 g of iron(II) chloride tetrahydrate, and 50 ml of de-gassed H2O.\n\tCAUTION! iron(III) chloride and iron(II) chloride tetrahydrate are harmful – wear personal protective equipment.\nReplace the reflux condenser and stir at 1,000 rpm while heating to 50 °C. Stirring under these conditions produces 10 nm diameter magnetite nanoparticles.",
    "Once at 50 °C, add 10 ml of 28% ammonium hydroxide solution by injecting through the rubber septum in the round-bottom flask while still stirring.\n\tCAUTION! ammonium hydroxide is harmful – wear personal protective equipment.\n\tNOTE: The ammonium hydroxide solution is used to precipitate the magnetite and the solution should turn black.\nRemove the rubber septum and N2 gas line from the round-bottom flask and heat to 90 °C to boil off the ammonia gas while still stirring.\n\tNOTE: It is optional to maintain the flow of N2 into the round-bottom flask by puncturing the reflux condenser’s rubber septum, however, oxidation of magnetite to maghemite is negligible during this step.\nOnce at 90 °C, add 1 ml of oleic acid to the round-bottom flask while still stirring. The oleic acid is used to coat the magnetite nanoparticles to form magnetite gel.\n\tCAUTION! oleic acid is harmful – wear personal protective equipment.\nReplace the rubber septum and N2 gas line onto the round-bottom flask and remove the reflux condenser.\nTurn off heat and stir at 500 rpm for 2 hr.\nRemove the round-bottom flask from the isomantle heater and decant any remaining liquid while using a strong magnet held against the bottom of the flask to retain the magnetite gel.\n\tCAUTION! handle the strong magnet with extreme care to avoid damage or injury.\nAllow magnetite gel to air-dry O/N (optional).\n2. Purification of Magnetite Gel\nAdd 40 ml of hexane into the round-bottom flask to dissolve the magnetite gel\n\tCAUTION! hexane is harmful – wear personal protective equipment and work in a fume hood.\nUse a separatory funnel with 40 ml of de-gassed H2O to remove residual H2O from the magnetite solution.",
    "Slowly pour the magnetite solution onto the H2O within the separatory funnel and gently swirl the two-phase liquid for 5 mins.\nDrain out and discard the lower aqueous fraction.\nSlowly add 40 ml of de-gassed H2O to the separatory funnel such that it settles beneath the magnetite solution and gently swirl and drain as before.\nRepeat to wash for a third time.\nTransfer magnetite solution to an Erlenmeyer flask, add a few spatulas worth of anhydrous sodium sulfate, and swirl to remove any remaining residual H2O from the magnetite solution.\nFilter the magnetite solution through 1 µm filter paper in a filter funnel to remove the sodium sulfate and residual H2O.\n\tNOTE: Vacuum assistance is recommended.\nTransfer the magnetite solution to a 50 ml evaporating flask and use a rotary evaporator to evaporate the hexane for 2 h with the following conditions: moderate rotation speed, vacuum applied, evaporating flask in a 50 °C water bath, and 24 °C water circulating through the condenser.\n\tNOTE: Optionally, store the magnetite gel prior to coating with PLGA.\n3. Coating of Magnetite Nanoparticles with PLGA Shell\nDissolve 3.60 g of PLGA (75/25 blend) in 240 ml of ethyl acetate to create a 1.5% (m/v) solution. CAUTION: ethyl acetate is harmful – wear personal protective equipment and work in a fume hood.\nDissolve 25.00 g of Pluronic F-127 in 500 ml of de-gassed H2O using a magnetic stirrer to create a 5.0% (m/v) solution.\n\tNOTE: Pluronic F-127 is a non-ionic amphiphilic block copolymer that acts as a biocompatible surfactant. It helps to stabilize the oil-in-water emulsion in step 3.3.2.\nUsing a microspatula, collect the magnetite gel into six 0.040 g aliquots within weighted glass vials. Perform the following coating and washing process for each aliquot.",
    "NOTE: The aliquots are necessary to ensure efficient handling and magnetic decantation, which will maximize purity and yield while minimizing degradation prior to freeze-drying in step 4.\n\t\nAdd a 0.040 g aliquot of magnetite gel and 40 ml of the PLGA solution to a plastic beaker and sonicate in an ultrasonic cleaner for 10 mins.\nAdd 80 ml of the Pluronic solution to the plastic beaker and immediately emulsify with a laboratory mixer at the highest setting for 7 mins to form the PLGA coating on the magnetite nanoparticles as an oil-in-water emulsion.\nImmediately dilute the SPION solution in 1 L of deionized H2O and sonicate for 1 h in a chemical fume hood to evaporate the ethyl acetate.\nPlace a strong magnet next to the SPION solution and gently stir to collect brownish SPIONs at the magnet.\n\t\tNOTE: It may be necessary to intermittently stir for several hours before the solution turns whitish indicating that most of the SPIONs have been collected.\nDecant the aqueous solution while retaining the SPIONs in the beaker with the magnet.\nWash the SPIONs three times as follows.\n\t\t\nSuspend the SPIONs in 1 L of deionized H2O.\nSonicate the SPION solution for 20 mins.\nPlace a strong magnet next to the SPION solution and gently stir to collect brownish SPIONs at the magnet. It may be necessary to intermittently stir for several hours before the solution turns clear indicating that most of the SPIONs have been collected.\nDecant the aqueous solution while retaining the SPIONs in the beaker with the magnet.\nCollect the SPIONs synthesized from each of the six magnetite gel aliquots into a single weighted glass vial as an aqueous suspension. Optionally decant excess water magnetically as needed.\n4. Freeze-drying of SPIONs\nFreeze the SPION solution.",
    "Freeze-dry the SPION solution O/N in a lyophilizer.\nWeigh the freeze-dried SPIONs. Freeze-dried SPIONs can be stored at -20 °C until used for cell labeling.\n\tNOTE: Storage at -20 °C dramatically reduces degradation kinetics and increases shelf life.\n5. Labeling of Cells with SPIONs\nSuspend an aliquot of SPIONs in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at a concentration of 40 mg/ml and sonicate for 30 mins.\nAdd the SPION solution to a nearly confluent flask of cells at a concentration of 5 µl/ml of cell culture medium. Ensure even distribution by gently rocking the flask.\nIncubate the cells for 16 hr at 37 °C.\nGently aspirate culture medium and wash cells twice with PBS.\nCollect magnetically-labeled cells and use for experiments.\nUnused SPION solution can be stored at 4 °C and should be used within a few months. Sonicate for 30 mins before each use.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
