    "1. Catalyst Patterning for SWNT Growth\nBegin with a silicon wafer with a low pressure chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown 500 nm Si3N4/ 500 nm SiO2 film on top.\nSpin coat a layer of photoresist (PR) at 500 rpm for 5 sec and then 4,000 rpm for 40 sec.\nBake the wafer at 115 °C for 90 sec.\nUse a photomask with rectangular pits for catalysts (Figure 1) and expose the wafer in UV (365 nm) irradiance of 300 mJ/cm2 for 0.3 sec. After exposure bake the wafer at 115 °C for 90 sec.\nTip: Design pits of different sizes e.g. 5 micron x 5 micron, 10 micron x 5 micron etc. to account for the variability in SWNT chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth process.\nDevelop the wafer in developer for 70 sec gently shaking the wafer through the process.\nRinse the wafer with DI water for 2 min and then blow dry with a nitrogen (N2) gun.\nLoad the developed wafer into e-beam evaporator chamber and deposit 0.5 nm iron (Fe) at a chamber pressure of 10-6 torr.\nDice the wafer into smaller dies 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm.\nRemove the photoresist by dipping in warm acetone and isopropanol (IPA) for 10 min each. This leaves behind Fe catalyst in the rectangular pits for nanotube growth.\n2. CVD Growth of Carbon Nanotubes\nPlace the catalyst coated dies in the quartz tube of the CVD growth furnace.\nTip: Determine sweet spot for nanotube growth. Growth is uniform over an area of 2inch x 2inch downstream for our furnace (Figure 2c).\nAnneal the substrate in air at 880 °C for one hour to remove photoresist residue (Figure 2a). Allow to cool down.\nPurge the chamber with Argon for 5 min at 3 SLM (standard liter per minute).",
    "Ramp up the furnace to 800 °C at the center of the tube, while maintaining a flow of 1 SLM of argon (Figure 2b).\nFlow 0.2 SLM of hydrogen for 5 min to reduce the catalyst particles i.e. convert iron oxide to iron.\nIntroduce 5.5 sccm (standard cubic centimeter per minute) of ethylene (C2H4) for 35 min to grow SWNTs. Maintain a H2 flow of 0.2 SLM throughout the process. The length of SWNTs obtained from this recipe is > 20 micron (μm).\nAllow the furnace to cool down to room temperature with a small argon flow.\n3. SWNT FET Transistor Fabrication\nDesign a photomask (Figure 1) for defining source-drain electrodes for current-voltage (I-V) characterization of carbon nanotubes.\nTip: Extend electrode contact pads far apart on the die so that they remain accessible even after putting down a micro-fluidic stamp on the active nanotube region.\nFollow steps 1.2 -1.6 to define area for metal deposition for contacts.\nDeposit Ti/Au 0.5 nm/50 nm for source-drain contacts in an e-beam evaporator chamber at 10-6 torr.\nLeave the die in acetone overnight for metal liftoff. After liftoff, dip the die in IPA for 10 min and then blow dry using N2 gun.\nDo a blanket deposition of 500 nm e-beam evaporated SiO2 for gate dielectric at 10-6 torr.\nDesign a photomask (Figure 1) for defining the gate electrode.\nFollow steps 1.2-1.6 to define region for gate metal deposition.\nEvaporate 50 nm/50 nm Cr/Au as the top gate electrode in e-beam evaporator. Follow step 3.4 for metal liftoff.\nTip: Use thick chrome layer to increase strength of suspended top gate. Gate dimensions are also critical for successful suspension.\nBlanket deposit a thin layer (20 nm) of SiO2 for top electrode passivation.",
    "Design a photomask (Figure 1) to open a trench in SiO2 to access the carbon nanotube channel. Design pad-etch area in the same mask to open up region for accessing source, drain and gate electrodes far away from the SWNT channel.\nFollow steps 1.2-1.6 to pattern the PR to open up the trench for wet etch of SiO2.\nWet etch the evaporated SiO2 using 1:20 BHF solution for 3 min and 30 sec. Si3N4 provides a etch stop layer to prevent further penetration of BHF.\nTip: Etch time calibration is recommended.\nThoroughly rinse the device in DI water, and then dip it in IPA for 5 min. Blow dry using a N2 gun. The device structure remains intact due to the thick chrome layer.\n4. Chemical Functionalization of Carbon Nanotube Sidewalls\nPrepare a solution of 6 mM 1-pyrenebutanoic acid succinimidyl ester (PBSE) in dimethylformamide (DMF).\nIncubate the SWNT FET die in this linker molecular solution for 1 hr at room temperature.\nThoroughly rinse the die in DMF to wash away the excess reagent. Blow-dry the device.\nPrepare a 20mg/ml solution of biotinyl-3, 6-dioxaoctanediamine (biotin PEO amine -BPA) in DI water for biotinylation of SWNTs.\nIncubate the die in this solution for 18 hr after which thoroughly rinse the die in DI water and blow dry. BPA attaches to the PBSE linker molecule.\nPrepare a solution of 1mg/ml streptavidin in 7.2 pH PBS solution for streptavidin binding.\nFor static measurements, incubate the die in streptavidin solution for 20 min to completely functionalize the biotinylated SWNT. Thoroughly rinse and blow dry the die. For real time sensing, stamp the PDMS flow channel (step 6) first and then flow the streptavidin solution in high ionic strength background for streptavidin binding (Figure 3).",
    "Note: We rinse the die by dispensing DI water (~50 ml) over the die using a squeeze bottle. Then we move the die to another Petri dish containing DI water and move the die around for 1 min. We repeat the two steps a total of 8-10 times.\n5. Preparation of Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) Mold for Fluid Chamber\nIn a weighing cup, pour 9 parts by weight of PDMS monomer and add 1 part by weight of curing agent and thoroughly mix the two.\nDegas the mixture in a desiccator for 25 min. The bubbles will rise through the mixture and leave.\nTip: If the mixture starts foaming, vent the chamber and let it settle down for a few seconds before degassing again.\nPlace a new silicon wafer in a Petri dish. Pour the degassed PDMS mixture on top of it to have a PDMS layer of 5 mm above the wafer.\nPlace the Petri dish in an oven at 70 °C for 1 hr.\nRemove the Petri dish and let it cool down. Use a scalpel to cut out a rectangular piece of PDMS and pull it out using a tweezer.\nTip: The PDMS side directly in contact with the silicon wafer is clean and extremely flat. This side will be in contact with the SWNT FET die. Be careful not to contaminate it.\nPlace the rectangular die upside down and drill a hole in it using a biopsy punch (3 mm diameter) from the flat side to the other. This ensures no rough edges on the flat side of PDMS (Figure 4a).",
    "Place the PDMS chamber on top of the device carefully by aligning it on top of the active area of the fabricated SWNT FET dies (Figure 4a, b). Tap it gently to secure the stamp on die. The flat side bonds to the die to provide a leak-tight chamber.\nTip: This can be done with the naked eye or using an optical microscope with enough working space. If the PDMS does not stick well (generally if the die and/or the PDMS stamp is not clean), do oxygen plasma (20 watts, 15 sec) on PDMS to assist bonding. Using plasma powers higher than this leads to stronger bonding, however, we have seen ripping of electrodes while removing the PDMS in such case.\nRemove the PDMS stamp after electrical testing and before next chemical functionalization step by dipping the die in DI water and gently lifting the stamp.\n6. Preparation of Microfluidic Flow Channel\nTake a clean silicon wafer and place it on hot plate at 200 °C for 5 min to remove any moisture.\nSpin coat SU-8 2015 at 500 rpm (100 rpm/sec ramp rate) for 5 sec and then 1,250 rpm for 30 sec at 300 rpm/sec ramp rate. This gives a 30 μm thick SU-8 layer on silicon wafer.\nSoft bake the wafer at 95 °C for 5 min.\nDesign a photomask (Figure 4c) to define the 300 μm wide flow channel pattern on top of the SWNT area.\nTip: To avoid collapse of structure a channel width: height ratio of 10:1 is sufficient (300 μm: 30 μm in this case).\nUsing 365-nm UV photolithography define the flow channel with a UV exposure time of 0.9 sec.\nPost bake the die at 95 °C for 5 min.",
    "Develop the pattern in SU-8 developer for 5 min accompanied by gentle shaking.\nRinse the wafer in IPA and blow dry with N2 gun.\nFollow steps 5.1-5.2 to prepare a PDMS mixture.\nPlace the wafer with SU-8 mold in a desiccator along with a 2-3 drop of silanizing agent trichloro(3, 3, 3-trifluoropropyl)silane in a Petri dish. Turn on the vacuum pump let the wafer sit in vacuum for 1 hr.\nPour the degassed PDMS mixture onto the wafer and heat it in an oven at 70 °C for 1 hr.\nCut the PDMS mold (negative of SU-8) using a scalpel.\nPlace the PDMS stamp upside down and using a biopsy punch (0.75 mm diameter) to drill a hole at each end of the flow channel. Make sure to drill the hole from the flat side (the side in contact with the silicon wafer) to the other to avoid rough edges (Figure 4e).\nPlace the PDMS flow chamber on top of the device carefully by aligning it on top of the active area of the fabricated SWNT FET dies under a microscope. Tap it gently to secure the stamp on die. The flat side bonds to the die to provide a leak-tight chamber. (Figure 4c and 4d)\nPush a polyethylene tube into the holes and connect the other end to a fluid source and drain syringe (Figure 4e).\nAttach the syringe to a syringe pump system to maintain a controlled flow of the fluid through the channel (Figure 6).\n7. DC Electrical Measurement Setup\nConnect the source and gate contacts of SWNT FET to voltage ports of a DAQ card.\nConnect the drain contact to input port of DAQ card through a current pre-amplifier.",
    "Apply 30 millivolt (mV) to source contact, sweep the gate voltage and record the current from the drain (Figure 5a).\nTip: For measurements in solution, keep gate voltage sweep parameter within |0.7 volts| to avoid leakage and reaction between the gate metal electrode and solution.\n8. AC Electrical Measurement Setup\nConnect the Ref-out signal from lock-in amplifier to the external modulation signal port on frequency generator to setup AM modulated frequency output.\nConnect source contact of SWNT FET to the AM-modulated RF output port of frequency generator and dc voltage from DAQ card using a bias tee (Figure 5b and 5c).\nConnect gate contact to voltage port of DAQ card.\nConnect the drain contact to a lock-in amplifier to read the ac current through the nanotube. Read the amplitude and phase of current through the DAQ input ports.\nHold source dc voltage at 0 volt and AM signal frequency at 200 kilohertz (kHz).\nSweep the gate voltage and measure the current from the drain.\nIncrease frequency and repeat step 8.6 for Imix-Vg sweeps at different frequencies.\n9. Electrical Measurements in Solution (No Flow)\nPrepare 1 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaCl and 100 mM NaCl salt solutions starting from 5M NaCl stock solution.\nTake the SWNT device from step 3.13. Carry out steps 4.1-4.5 to obtain a biotinylated device.\nFollow step 5 to put a PDMS chamber on top of the device.\nFill the chamber with DI water using a pipette.\nFollow step 8 for frequency mixing measurements for different frequencies.\nRepeat 9.4 for the three different salt solutions 1 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaCl and 100 mM NaCl.\nTip: Use pipette to withdraw previous solution and then flush the chamber multiple times with the new solution. Always switch from the low to high concentration solutions.",
    "Remove the PDMS stamp by gently lifting the stamp with a tweezer.\nThoroughly rinse the device with DI water.\nCarry out streptavidin binding as explained in 4.6-4.7.\nRepeat steps 9.3-9.6.\n10. Electrical Measurement in Solution (Real Time Flow)\nPrepare 100 mM NaCl salt solution starting from 5 M NaCl stock solution.\nTake the SWNT device from step 3.13. Carry out steps 4.1-4.5 to obtain a biotinylated device.\nPlace the micro-fluidic flow channel on the device following step 6.. Connect an empty syringe to one end of the micro-fluidic channel for withdrawal mode operation. At the other end attach a syringe with background solution of 100 mM NaCl.\nSet up the electrical measurement as detailed in step 8. Fix the frequency (f = 10 MHz) and gate voltage bias (V = 0).\nStart syringe pump in withdrawal mode (flow rate = 0.4 ml hour-1) and monitor the current signal with time. Switch the solution to 1mg/ml streptavidin in 100 mM NaCl and monitor signal change for streptavidin-biotin binding (Figure 6).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
