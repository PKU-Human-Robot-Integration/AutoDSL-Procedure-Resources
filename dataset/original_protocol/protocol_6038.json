    "In vitro transcription/translation of a transcription factor using AlphaScreen®Preparation of DNA template for in vitro transcription/translationTo attach a protein tag, in this case, “FLAG®-tag” to N-terminus of a target transcription factor, perform the two-step PCR method. All primers for making transcription templates are shown in Table 1.Note: For details, please refer to articles published in Genes Cells (Nomoto and Tada, 2018a) and Methods Mol Biol (Nomoto and Tada, 2018b) which include all the procedures for in vitro transcription/translation.

In this case, cDNA region cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO was used as a 1st PCR template. Run the following 1st PCRStep 1: 94 °C for 5 minStep 2: 30 cycles of a) 98 °C for 10 s b) 55 °C for 30 s c) 68 °C for 3 min (30-60 s/kb)Step 3: 72 °C for 2 minStep 4: 4 °C until agarose gel electrophoresisNote: Temperature in this step (hybridization step) depends on primer sequences. You can change the temperature for this step according to normal PCR methods. It should be between 55 °C and 65 °C. Run 2 µl of the 1st PCR sample on agarose gel (1.5% [w/v] in 1x TAE buffer) electrophoresis to check the quantity and size of PCR amplicon (Figure 1).",
    "Note: If multiple PCR amplicons are detected in single PCR, gel extraction of a target band is recommended.

One transcription reaction requires 25 µl of purified 2nd PCR amplicon containing 300 to 600 ng DNA.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190128/20190128225638_2640.jpgFigure 1.

MYB30 coding region cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO vector is used as the template for 1st PCR.

    "Prepare the following transcriptional master mix (for one sample) on ice:2.5 µl of 10x Transcription Buffer (provided in the kit)1.25 µl of 0.1 M DTT (provided in the kit)2.5 µl of 25 mM NTPs (provided in the kit)1 µl of T7 RNA polymerase (provided in the kit)Add 15.25 µl of RNase-free waterNote: If RNA degradation occurs, an RNase inhibitor should be added to the transcription mix. Dispense 22.5 µl of the above transcription mix to each new tube (RNase-free tube recommended) and add 2.5 µl of 2nd PCR product carefully (Purification of 2nd PCR products is not necessarily required).Note: NUProtein kit contains positive control DNA (2nd PCR amplicon) which can be used as a positive control for the in vitro transcription reaction. Incubate the sample at 37 °C for 3 h in a block incubator.Note: Incubation time depends on the type and length of mRNA, and may vary from 30 min to 3 h. Water incubator can also be used instead of block incubator. Run 1 µl of the transcription reaction sample can be loaded on agarose gel (1.5% [w/v] in 1x TAE buffer) electrophoresis to check the quantity and quality of mRNA (Figure 1). Add 10 µl of 4 M ammonium acetate and 100 µl of 99.5 % ethanol per sample (total volume: 124 µl/sample.Mix the sample by gentle vortexing or tapping and incubate at -20 °C for 20 min after centrifugation for a few seconds.Centrifuge the sample at 17,700 x g for 20 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatant carefully.Repeat centrifugation for few seconds to remove the residual solution completely using a pipette.Dry the pellet by keeping the tube lid open for about 10 min.Add 70 µl of RNase-free water per sample and incubate at RT for about 15 min.",
    "Dissolve the pellet well by gentle tapping and centrifuging for a few seconds.In vitro protein synthesisPrepare the following translation reaction master mix (for one sample) into 1.5 ml tube on ice:20 µl of wheat germ extract (WGE) (provided in the kit)20 µl of amino acid mixture (AAM) (provided in the kit)Mix the translation reaction master mix gently, and incubate at RT for 15 min.Note: Preincubation of WGE and AAM may enhance the translation efficiency. Add 40 µl of the translation reaction mix to 70 µl of prepared mRNA carefully (total volume: 110 µl/sample).Note: Do not make bubbles during additions. Make AlphaScreen® negative control by adding 40 µl of the translation reaction mix to 70 µl of RNase-free water. Incubate the sample at 16 °C for 10 h without agitation.Centrifuge the sample at 17,700 x g for 10 min at 4 °C and transfer the supernatant (approximately 118 µl) to a new tube.Mix 1 µl of the in vitro-synthesized protein, 4 µl of 4x SDS sample buffer, 1 µl of 2 M DTT, and 6 µl of water in a new tube.Note: Remaining protein sample can be stored at -80 °C. We recommend flash-freezing the sample using liquid N2. Repeated freeze-thaw cycles decrease the activity of synthesized proteins. When using frozen protein for any assay, quickly thaw the sample by hand. Heat protein sample at 70 °C for 20 min and perform SDS-PAGE in a 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel and confirm the synthesized target protein by western blotting with anti-DYKDDDDK tag antibody.AlphaScreen® assayPreparation of double-stranded DNA probes by annealingFor AlphaScreen®, detecting the interaction between protein and DNA, prepare biotinylated (target sample) and non-biotinylated (control for the detection) 50 bp DNA probes.",
    "For obtaining stable AlphaScreen® results, we recommend designing the DNA probes that contain putative DNA binding sequence of the target transcription factor in the central region (11 bp to 40 bp from 5’ end of the probe [Figure 2A]). Mix 20 µl of 20 µM biotinylated 50 bp single-strand DNA (or 20 µl of 20 µM non-biotinylated 50 bp single strand DNA) and 20 µl of 20 µM complementary unmodified 50 bp single-strand DNA in 1.5 ml tube (total volume: 40 µl).Incubate the DNA mixture at 95 °C for 10 min, let it cool down until it reaches RT.Note: Double-strand DNA probes can be stored at -20 °C. Check annealed double-stranded DNA probes by polyacrylamide gel (12% w/v) electrophoresis (Figure 2B).Note: At the same time prepare DNA probe for the negative control, which does not contain any putative DNA binding sequence of the target transcription factor. If required, also prepare the DNA probes that contain mutation in the target sequence.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190128/20190128225706_8269.jpgFigure 2.

Red lines and box indicate the region that contains putative DNA binding sequence of the target transcription factor. B. Polyacrylamide gel (10%) electrophoresis of DNA probes. Lane 1: DNA marker (2-log ladder), lane 2: 5’-biotinylated 50-base single-strand DNA, lane 3: Complementary 50-base single-strand DNA, lane 4: Annealed double-strand DNA. The polyacrylamide gel was stained with ethidium bromide after electrophoresis.AlphaScreen® assay with FLAG (M2) Detection kitPrepare the following protein-DNA binding mix (total volume: 13 µl/sample):2.5 µl of 10x control buffer [provided in FLAG (M2) Detection kit]2.5 µl of 0.1% (w/v) Tween® 202.5 µl of 1% (w/v) BSA1 µl of 1 ng/µl dAdTAdd 4.5 µl of ultrapure water.",
    "Note: Depending on the target transcription factor, dGdC should be used instead of dAdT. Dispense 13.0 µl of the protein-DNA binding mix to the 384-well plate and add 2 µl of 625 nM of double-stranded DNA probe and 4-fold diluted FLAG-tagged target transcription factor protein.Note: Also add 2 µl of 4-fold diluted negative control protein. Incubate protein-DNA binding mix at RT for 1 h.Note: Dilution range of synthesized protein depends on the feature of target transcription factor. Two to ten times dilution can be used for this assay. Incubation under dark condition is not necessary for this step. Add 4 µl of 40-fold diluted (with ultrapure water) acceptor beads and incubate at RT for 1 h.Note: Incubation under dark condition is not necessary for this step. Add 4 µl of 40-fold diluted (with ultrapure water) donor beads and incubate at RT for 1 h to 12 h in the dark (total volume: 25 µl).Note: To ensure that the plate is in the dark, wrap it with aluminum foil and remove it before keeping it in the Alpha plate reader. Detect signal by EnSpireTM Alpha Plate Reader. After the excitation at 680 nm, the emission wavelengths between 520 and 620 nm are measured as AlphaScreen® unit."
