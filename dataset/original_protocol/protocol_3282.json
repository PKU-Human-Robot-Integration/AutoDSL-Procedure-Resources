    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis protocol describes tagging of both alleles of the Ptbp1 gene with C-terminal mini-AID (mAID) sequences in TRE-OsTIR1 ESCs introduced above. We further outline the procedure for assaying inducible degradation of mAID-tagged PTBP1. In short, we co-transfect cells with a Ptbp1-specific CRISPR-Cas9 construct and two Ptbp1-specific HDR constructs with different selection markers. We provide HDR constructs with three markers to choose from: HygR, BSD and PuroR (conferring mammalian cell resistance against hygromycin B, blasticidin S and puromycin, respectively; Addgene ## 206997, 206998, 206999). However, we tend to obtain more biallelically tagged TRE-OsTIR1 clones using the HygR and BSD combination and describe this selection approach below. Once the Ptbp1-mAID knock-in clones (with the TRE-OsTIR1, Ptbp1mAID/mAID genotype) are established and validated, they are treated with Dox and auxin (indole-3-acetic acid, or IAA), and the expression of OsTIR1 and mAID-tagged PTBP1 (PTBP1-mAID) is assayed by RT-qPCR and immunoblotting.\nBiallelic knock-in of mAID sequences\nTiming: 3–4 weeks\nThis part of the protocol describes biallelic tagging of the mouse Ptbp1 gene with auxin-inducible degron sequences. The TRE-OsTIR1 cells used for this purpose are described in the before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] section.\nGenerate a CRISPR-Cas9 construct targeting the junction between the open reading frame and the 3′UTR in your gene of interest using an appropriate gRNA design tool (e.g., https://www.benchling.com[href=https://www.benchling.com]).\nNote: We provide a Ptbp1-specific CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid (pML45; Addgene #206995) prepared by inserting the gRNA-encoding Ptbp1_gRNA_F/ Ptbp1_gRNA_R oligonucleotide duplex (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) into pX3308[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] cut with BbsI.\nNote: In the example described in this section, the mAID tag is added to the C-terminus of the protein of interest. The knock-in strategy should be modified accordingly if N-terminal tagging is required.\nGenerate HDR constructs for in-frame C-terminal mAID tagging of your gene of interest with 2 different markers.",
    "Note: We provide three such constructs for Ptbp1 encoding the HygR, BSD, and PuroR eukaryotic selection markers (Addgene ##206997, 206998, 206999) and recommend using the HygR and BSD combination for targeting the TRE-OsTIR1 cells. To build these constructs, Ptbp1-specific left and right homology arms were amplified from mouse genomic DNA using the Ptbp1_HAL_F/Ptbp1_HAL_R and Ptbp1_HAR_F/Ptbp1_HAR_R primer pairs (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]), respectively. The left and the right arms were then cloned into pML42 (a HygR-encoding vector) and pML49 (a PuroR-encoding vector) at the SacI-BamHI and the BstBI-AvrII sites, respectively, producing the pML58 and pML60 HDR constructs.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] To prepare the BSD-containing HDR construct pML646, pML58 was cut with NheI-Acc65I and HygR was replaced by a BSD-containing fragment amplified from pLenti6-LacZ (Invitrogen) using the BSD_F/BSD_R primer pair (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). For best results, we recommend keeping the length of the homology arms >500 bp.\nGrow TRE-OsTIR1 cells in 2i+LIF with 100 μg/mL of G418 as described in the \"knocking in the OsTIR1 transgene into A2lox ESC genome[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2]\" section.\nOn the day of transfection, trypsinize the culture, quench trypsin, and count the cells using hemocytometer.\nTransfect 0.75–1×106 cells resuspended in 4 mL of 2i+LIF with a mixture containing 500 ng each of a CRISPR-Cas9 construct (e.g., pML45) and HygR- and BSD-containing HDR constructs (e.g., pML58 and pML646), 3 μL of Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat# 11668019) and 100 μL of Opti-MEM I (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat# 31985070) in 6-cm bacterial dishes (Corning, cat# BP53-06) for 2 h (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nNote: Use mock-transfected cells as a negative control.\nCollect the cells by centrifugation for 5 min at 200 × g.",
    "Resuspend the pellet in 2 mL of 2i+LIF, and plate duplicated 100, 200 and 500 μL aliquots to individual wells of a gelatin-coated 6-well TC plate in the final volume of 2 mL of 2i+LIF supplemented with 0.5 μM Alt-R HDR Enhancer V2 (IDT, cat# 10007910).\nAfter 24–48 h in a TC incubator, replace the medium with 2 mL/well of 2i+LIF containing 150 μg/mL of hygromycin B and 8 μg/mL of blasticidin S.\nPropagate the cells for an additional 10–15 days with regular medium changes (every 1–3 days depending on the extent of cell death) to allow antibiotic-resistant cells to form colonies.\nNote: We recommend performing killing curve assays to confirm the efficiency of hygromycin B and blasticidin S before beginning the cloning experiment.\nNote: Although mAID knock-in TRE-OsTIR1 cells (e.g., Ptbp1-mAID) remain resistant to G418, we do not use this antibiotic when selecting hygromycin B and blasticidin S resistant clones to avoid excessive cell stress. G418 can be added to the medium at 100 μg/mL once the mAID knock-in line has been established.\nPick and dissociate the colonies as described in the \"knocking in the OsTIR1 transgene into A2lox ESC genome[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2]\" section. Transfer the entire volume to a gelatinized TC-grade flat-bottom 96-well plate containing 200 μL of 2i+LIF with 2% FBS and 150 μg/mL of hygromycin B and 8 μg/mL of blasticidin S per well.\nNote: Colonies ready for picking should be visible without a microscope in cultures transfected with the CRISPR-Cas9 and HDR plasmid mixture but not in the mock-transfected control (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B–2D).\nNote: If colony detachment becomes a problem, add 1% of FBS to the medium 4–5 days prior to colony picking.\nNext morning, change the medium to 2i+LIF without FBS and with 100 μg/mL of hygromycin B and 5 μg/mL of blasticidin S per well.",
    "When the wells reach 60%–70% confluence (typically in 2–4 days):\nTrypsinize the cells.\nQuench with 200 μL of 2i+LIF with 2% FBS.\nTransfer half of the volume to a fresh gelatinized TC-grade flat-bottom 96-well plate containing 100 μL of 2i+LIF with 2% FBS and 100 μg/mL of hygromycin B and 5 μg/mL of blasticidin S per well.\nNote: Use the remaining half of the volume for DNA purification and PCR genotyping as soon as possible (see below).\nBased on the PCR genotyping results (see below), select correct clones and passage them through the 24-well plate, 6-well plate, and 6-cm dish steps in 2i+LIF without FBS and with 100 μg/mL of hygromycin B and 5 μg/mL of blasticidin S.\nCryopreserve the clones from 6-cm dish cultures using the procedure described in the \"propagating ESCs in 2i medium with LIF[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.1]\" section.\nNote: We typically prepare 6–8 × 0.5-mL aliquots from a 60%–80% confluent 6-cm dish and use them to revive the cells in the 6-cm dish format.\nPause point: Clones can be cryopreserved as 1–2 aliquots at the 24-well or the 6-well passaging step and expanded when convenient.\nGenotyping knock-in ESCs and assaying inducible degradation of mAID-tagged protein\nTiming: 1 week\nThis part of the protocol describes molecular characterization of the mAID-tagged ESC clones.\nCritical: Perform genotyping as soon as possible to reduce the workload associated with passaging of numerous clones.\nCentrifuge the 96-well plate with remaining half of trypsinized cells from step 12 of the previous section using a 96-well plate rotor at 1500 × g for 10 min.\nNote: We typically centrifuge cells in the flat-bottom plates where they grew. However, to analyze <60% confluent cultures, cell suspensions should be transferred to 96-well PCR plates prior to centrifugation to avoid losing the pellets.",
    "Remove the supernatants using a multichannel pipette and extract the DNA from the cell pellets using PCRBIO Rapid Extract PCR Kit, as recommended by the manufacturer[href=https://pcrbio.com/products/dna-extraction/pcrbio-rapid-extract-pcr-kit/].\nAlternatives: Resuspend the cell pellets in the smaller volume of the final PCRBIO Rapid Extract mix (down to 30–40 μL) and incubate the plate for 5 min at 75°C and then for 10 min at 95°C.\nPause point: The lysates can be used directly for PCR genotyping or stored at 4°C for up to 24 h or at −20°C for up to a week.\nTo check whether the mAID-containing sequences were correctly integrated at the targeted loci, genotype the DNA samples from the previous step by multiplex PCR designed to amplify both the wild-type and knock-in alleles.\nNote: When tagging Ptbp1 with the pML45, pML58, and pML646 plasmid mixture, we performed this assay using F1, R2, and R3 primers (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]; Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) and the DNA polymerase from the PCRBIO Rapid Extract PCR Kit using the following conditions:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3051_6.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3051_7.csv\nAnalyze PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B) and select clones with robust amplification of the knock-in specific fragment and lacking the endogenous wild-type specific product for expansion (step 13 of the previous section) and protein immunodetection assays (see below).\nNote: In theory, F1/R3 primers can be used to differentiate between the wild type and mAID-tagged loci. However, the expected size of the mAID-tagged product is > 3 kb which may make it difficult to amplify it in a robust manner.\nOptional: Knock-in clones can be further verified by additional PCR assays described in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C and Sanger sequencing (not shown).\nTo analyze the efficacy of inducible protein degradation:",
    "Plate 0.5–1×105 cells from each expanded clone of interest per well of 12-well plate in 1 mL of 2i+LIF supplemented with 1 μg/mL of Dox and 0.5 mM indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and grow for 24 h.\nCollect the cells and analyze levels of protein of interest by immunoblotting with antibodies against the mAID-tagged protein (for mAID-tagged PTBP1, we use 1:1000 dilution of the cat# ab133734 antibody from Abcam; Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nNote: Use TRE-OsTIR1 and mAID-tagged (e.g., Ptbp1-mAID) cells treated with DMSO, or with Dox or IAA only as negative controls. If cytotoxicity becomes an issue, the concentration of IAA can be optimized within the 0.1–0.5 mM range.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]\nOptional: Analyze the expression of the OsTIR1 protein by immunoblotting with anti-OsTIR1 antibodies (cat# PD048, MBL Life Science) as described.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nAlternatives: Grow the 12-well cultures with 1 μg/mL of Dox for 16–24 h to pre-induce OsTIR1 expression and then supplement the wells with 0.5 mM IAA to trigger mAID-tagged protein degradation. In our experience, 4–6 h of IAA treatment of Dox-preinduced cultures is sufficient to reduce PTBP-mAID protein abundance to <10% of its original level."
