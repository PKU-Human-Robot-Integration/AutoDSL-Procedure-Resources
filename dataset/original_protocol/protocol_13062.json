    "1. Preparation of stock solutions and gelification mixture\nNOTE: Four stock solutions will be prepared (400 mg/mL of melezitose, 400 mg/mL of trehalose, 0.75 mg/mL of lysine, and 200 mg/mL of glycogen) and mixed according to the proportion shown in Table 1 to produce the gelification mixture. Although the protocol describes 10 mL of stock solutions production, it can be adapted for lower or higher volumes.\nMelezitose solution\n\t\nWeigh 4 g of melezitose in a 15 mL plastic tube, add 6 mL of nuclease-free water, and vortex at the maximum speed of the instrument until the powder is solubilized.\n\t\t​NOTE: More water can be added to facilitate solubilization, taking care not to exceed the final volume (see below).\nMake up the final volume to 10 mL with nuclease-free water. Label and store at 2-8 °C for up to 6 months.\nTrehalose solution\n\t\nWeigh 4 g of trehalose in a 15 mL plastic tube, add 6 mL of nuclease-free water, and vortex at the maximum speed of the instrument until the powder is solubilized.\n\t\tNOTE: More water can be added to facilitate solubilization, taking care not to exceed the final volume (see below).\nMake up the volume to 10 mL with nuclease-free water and filter the solution through a 0.2 µm filter. Label and store at 2-8 °C for up to 6 months.\nGlycogen solution\n\t\nWeigh 2 g of glycogen in a 15 mL plastic tube, add 6 mL of nuclease-free water, and vortex at the maximum speed of the instrument until the powder is solubilized.\n\t\tNOTE: More water can be added to facilitate solubilization, taking care not to exceed the final volume (see below).",
    "Keep the solution at rest at 2-8 °C for 8-12 h because the solubilization of glycogen produces lots of bubbles (Figure 1). Make up the volume to 10 mL with nuclease-free water. Label and store at 2-8 °C for up to 6 months.\nLysine solution\n\t\nWeigh 7.5 mg of lysine in a 15 mL plastic tube, add 6 mL of nuclease-free water. Vortex at the maximum speed of the instrument until the powder is solubilized.\n\t\tNOTE: More water can be added to facilitate solubilization, taking care not to exceed the final volume (see below).\nMake up the volume to 10 mL with nuclease-free water and filter the solution through a 0.2 µm filter. Transfer the solution to an amber flask or protect it from light. Label and store at 2-8 °C degrees for up to 6 months.\nGelification Mixture (GM)\n\t\nIn a 50 mL plastic tube, mix the volumes of stock solutions according to Table 1.\nMix the reagents by ten end-to-end inversions of the tube.\n\t\tNOTE: There is no need for a filtration step if this step is performed in a laminar flow safety hood. If this step is not performed in a clean environment, filter the solution through a 0.2 µm filter before transferring it to an amber flask.\nTransfer the solution to an amber flask or protect it from light. Label and store at 2-8 °C for up to 3 months.\n\t\tNOTE: As a quality control step for preparing the gelification mixture, ensure that the measured pH, conductivity, and density values are within the following ranges: pH 5.55-6.66; conductivity 0.630-0.757 mS/cm; and density 1.08-1.11 g/cm3. All measurements should be taken at 25 °C.\n2. Preparation of qPCR master mix for gelification",
    "NOTE: In this step, the qPCR master mix for gelification is prepared. Hence, water is not added to the mix but instead, the gelification mixture is added (Table 2).\nThaw the reagents in a refrigerated container. Mix the reagents in a 1.5 mL tube according to Table 2. An example of a reaction with a final volume of 25 µL containing 5 µL of DNA sample is shown here.\n\tNOTE: The DNA sample is not added to the mixture in this step; it is used here solely to calculate the final volumes of each reagent of the qPCR master mix. DNA samples should be added right before starting the run (see step 4 below).\n3. Gelification of the reagents on the reaction vessels\nAppropriately multiply the volumes shown in Table 2 for preparation of an eight-tube strip or a 96-well plate.\nPipet 18.5 µL of the gelification master mix shown in Table 2 onto each reaction well.\n\tNOTE: This volume represents the volumes of oligonucleotide mix, PCR buffer, and gelification mixture used for one reaction (according to Table 2) and will vary depending on the concentration of the reagents and the volume needed for one reaction. The final volume in the gelification master mix is different from the volume in a regular master mix because water is not added.\nPlace the tubes/plate in the heat-conductive support (e.g., aluminum) inside the vacuum oven.\n\tNOTE: The heat-conductive support is optional. The operator must ensure that the bottom of the tubes is in contact with the vacuum oven shelf to allow fast thermal equilibrium.\nPlace one bentonite clay bag for every two 96-well plates.",
    "NOTE: Bentonite clay bags are used to absorb the removed water from the gelification master mix by the differential pressure exerted by the vacuum. Bentonite clay bags were found to be unnecessary for less than two 96-well plates.\nSubject the tubes/plate containing the gelification master mix to three vacuum cycles (30 ± 5 mBar) of 30 min each, alternating with vacuum release until the atmospheric pressure is achieved (900-930 mBar), under controlled temperature (30 °C ± 1 °C) (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: The instrument uses software to control the parameters, and an example of the cycle is shown in Figure 2. The user must create the profile for the run, indicating the chosen parameters.\nWhen the cycle is completed, check the tubes/plates for proper gelification of the reagents by ensuring that the volume is visibly reduced (Figure 3) and that the liquids do not move upon tapping the tubes/plates with fingers.\n\tNOTE: If gelification did not occur, the solution would splatter on the tube walls when tubes are tapped (Figure 3).\nSeal and store the tubes/plates at 2-8 °C for 8-12 h before use.\n4. Using a gelified qPCR\nRemove the tube strip or plate from the refrigerator and open it in a workstation for sample manipulation. Add 15 µL of nuclease-free water to each reaction vessel.\n\tNOTE: The volume of gelified reagents is considered to be about 5 µL. So, together with the DNA sample volume (see below), the final reaction volume is 25 µL.\nAdd 5 µL of DNA sample.\n\tNOTE: Any qPCR-quality DNA template might be used. In the present work, DNA was extracted from 108 T. cruzi epimastigotes (strain Dm28c) and was serially diluted at a 1:10 ratio using TE buffer.",
    "Seal the tubes/plates and proceed to the equipment of choice. Run the experiment and proceed to regular data analysis.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
