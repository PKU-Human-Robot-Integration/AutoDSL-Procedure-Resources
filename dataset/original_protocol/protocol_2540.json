    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nsgRNA design\nTiming: 1 day (for step 1)\nThis section describes how to design sgRNA and choose appropriate base editors for gene targeting in the rice genome.\nRetrieve the sequence of the target gene from the rice genome information website (http://rice.uga.edu/[href=http://rice.uga.edu/]).\nIdentify putative PAM sequences by scanning the target gene sequence on both strands near the target base, which refines the choice of an appropriate base editor.\nNote: Select appropriate base editors based on the target base and PAM sequence. Indeed, different Cas proteins recognize distinct PAM sequences. For example, SpCas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes requires a 20-bp spacer followed by the consensus PAM sequence NGG. When the target base is A or T and the PAM sequence is NGG, SpCas9 and Cas9-NG can be selected as the ABE base editor, such as rBE49d that fused TadA variant with SpCas9.\nNote: The target base should be located within the activity window of the base editor.\nSelect the appropriate base editor as a function of the target base: ABE for As or CBE for Cs.\nDesign and synthesize oligonucleotide pairs.\nExample: Sequences marked in red represent the target site; bold nucleotides indicate the PAM.\nLOC_Os05g25770 gene sequence:\nGTGCTGAGCAGCCTCACGCCCGGCAGCTCCGCGGCGCGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGAGTCGCGGGTCCCTTCGGGCCGGACCAGGGCGATGTCACGTCCTCCCTGCACTGGAGCTACGACGCCGTCGCCGGCATGGAGTTCTTCAAGAACGACGAGGTTGTCTTCGATCTGGACGACATTATGGGTTTGAGCTTT.\nBased on the gene sequence, design a pair of oligonucleotides are:\nForward oligonucleotide: 5′-GGAGCTACGACGCCGTCGC-3′.\nReverse oligonucleotide: 5′-GCGACGGCGTCGTAGCTCC-3′.\nNote: Predict potential off-targets using websites such as CRISPR RGEN Tools (rgenome.net[href=http://www.rgenome.net/cas-offinder/]). Spacers without potential off-target are desirable.\nNote: Design primer pairs at NCBI (National Center for Biotechnological Information, ncbi.nlm.nih.gov[href=http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov]) to amplify PCR fragments that include the target site.",
    "Critical: The sgRNA cassette is driven by the U6 promoter. The first nucleotide of the spacer must be G; if it is not G, it should be replaced by a G. Add a 4-bp adapter sequence complementary to the sticky end of the BtgZI restriction site to the 5′ end of the oligonucleotide (indicated as lowercase letters).\nTarget oligonucleotide 1: 5′-tgttGGAGCTACGACGCCGTCGC-3′.\nTarget oligonucleotide 2: 5′-aaacGCGACGGCGTCGTAGCTCC-3′.\nsgRNA plasmid construction\nTiming: 3–5 days (for step 5)\nDetailed description of inserting spacer into pENTR:sgRNA4, the sgRNA-expressing cassette in this entry construct can be gatewayed to any destination vector carrying Cas or engineered Cas through recombination reaction.\nThe synthesized oligonucleotides are phosphorylated and annealed to form a double-stranded DNA molecule, which is then inserted into the pENTR:sgRNA4 plasmid digested with BtgZI.\nThe phosphorylation reaction is mixed and incubated at a constant temperature of 37°C for 30 min to phosphorylate the oligonucleotides. Place the mixture in boiling water for 5 min to denature the DNA, before allowing the mixture to cool down naturally to 20°C–25°C. Each phosphorylation reaction consists of:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2173_11.csv\nThe annealed oligonucleotide pair forms double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), which is then kept at −20°C for ligation into the linearized vector.\nLinearized pENTR:sgRNA4 plasmid.\nThe circular pENTR:sgRNA4 vector is digested with the restriction enzyme BtgZI at 60°C for 1 h.\nRun the restriction digest on an agarose gel (1%); excise the linearized band and purify with a DNA Gel Recovery Kit; store at −20°C. BtgZI restriction enzyme setup:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2173_12.csv\nNote: The expected size of linearized pENTR:sgRNA4 vector is 3,156 bp.\nLigate the linearized pENTR:sgRNA4 vector with the phosphorylated dsDNA oligonucleotide with T4 DNA ligase, resulting in pENTR:gRNA-Target.\nLigation reaction between spacer and linearized pENTR:gRNA:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2173_13.csv",
    "Note: The reaction time is preferably no more than 2 h, as longer incubation periods may cause multiple dsDNA oligonucleotide copies to be inserted into the linearized vector.\nTransform competent cells with the ligation reaction:\nThaw E. coli T1 competent cells on ice after removing from −80°C.\nAdd 10 μL of the ligation reaction to 100 μL E. coli T1 competent cells and mix gently. Place on ice for 30 min.\nHeat shock for 45 s at 42°C. Then immediately chill on ice for 2–3 min.\nAdd 700 μL of LB medium to the samples and shake at 180 rpm for 1 h at 37°C.\nCentrifuge the tube at 4,000 g for 1 min to pellet the bacteria. Discard 600 μL of the supernatant, resuspend the cells in the remaining medium, and spread on LB agar plates containing 50 mg/L Kan.\nIncubate plates at 37°C for 8–10 h. Multiple visible single colonies will appear on the plate.\nPCR detection and sequencing.\nPick individual colonies for PCR with the following conditions. Run standard PCR amplification (25–30 cycles) on a thermal cycler. PCR conditions:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2173_14.csv\nPCR cycling conditions\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2173_15.csv\nCheck for insertion of the dsDNA oligonucleotide by agarose gel (1%, w/v) electrophoresis.\nNote: The expected size of the PCR product will be 345 bp if the spacer is inserted.\nAccording to the electrophoresis results above, select colonies and inoculate 2 mL sterile LB containing 50 mg/L Kan and grow at 37°C with 200 rpm shaking for 8–12 h.\nExtract the recombinant plasmid using a Plasmid DNA mini kit for sequencing.\nNote: The orientation and copy number of inserted oligos should be verified by Sanger sequencing.\nABE plasmid construction\nTiming: 3–5 days (for step 10)\nThis section describes generation of destination construct containing both sgRNA and ABE by Gateway cloning.",
    "Obtain the sgRNA cassette.\nThe plasmid mentioned in step d above is digested with ApaI. Digestion reaction with FastDigest ApaI restriction enzyme:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2173_16.csv\nRun 1% agarose gel with the digestion products; excise the band of interest and purify with DNA Gel Recovery Kit; store at −20°C.\nNote: Expected size of bands are 2,125 and 1,054 bp; excise the 2,125-bp band.\nThe sgRNA-expressing cassette (purified band above) is recombined into the binary vector rBE49d via LR clonase reaction to construct the rBE49d-gRNA vector.\nGateway reaction:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2173_17.csv\nAs above, add 2.5 μL of the Gateway reaction to 100 μL of JM109 competent cells for transformation and isolation of the resulting plasmid.\nNote: The rBE49d vector contains the ccdB gene, which is lethal to all E. coli strains except DB3.1. After Gateway cloning, the ccdB gene is replaced by the sgRNA expression cassette, and the recombined vector can be transformed into JM109 cells.\nPick single colonies for colony PCR on a thermal cycler. Refer to step 8 for PCR conditions.\nExtract the recombinant plasmid using a Plasmid DNA Mini Kit.\nA. tumefaciens-mediated genetic transformation of rice\nTiming: 10–12 weeks (for step 15)\nThis section describes detailed procedures of rice tissue culture used for A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation.\nTransform the rBE49d-gRNA plasmid into Agrobacterium tumefaciens.\nNote: There are two ways to introduce the vector into rice cells: Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation or particle bombardment of cells. In this protocol, Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation is used.\nIncubate 100 μL of Agrobacterium competent cells (strain EHA105) at 37°C for 5 min.\nAdd 1 μg plasmid to the competent cells, mix gently, and place on ice for 30 min.\nFreeze the tube in liquid nitrogen for 1 min, take it out, and incubate at 37°C for 5 min.",
    "Add 700 μL of LB medium to the tubes and shake them at 180 rpm for 3 h at 30°C.\nCentrifuge the tube at 5,000 g for 1 min to collect the bacteria. Discard 600 μL of the supernatant and resuspend the cells in the remaining liquid.\nSpread the resuspended cells on LB agar plate containing 50 mg/L Kan and 50 mg/L Rif. Incubate plates at 30°C for 2–3 d. Multiple visible single colonies should appear.\nPick single colonies for colony-PCR (25–30 cycles) on a thermal cycler.\nPause point: A. tumefaciens strains can be stored at −80°C for a long time.\nCallus induction.\nSelect a 15-mL centrifuge tube and surface sterilize 30 dehusked immature rice seeds in 50% (v/v) sodium hypochlorite solution (10 mL Sodium hypochlorite, 10 mL ddH2O, and one drop of Tween-20) on a shaker at 20 rpm for 45 min at 20°C–25°C.\nWash the seeds with ddH2O 3–5 times.\nPlace seeds onto MSD plate (∼30 seeds/petri dish) and incubate for 10 days (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) in a growth chamber (16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod at 28°C, or constant light at 28°C) for callus tissue induction.\nThe embryos and seed coats are removed with forceps, and the calli are transferred to new MSD plates and incubated for 3–5 days before use for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation.\nAgrobacterium infection.\nInoculate fresh bacterial colonies into a 125-mL conical flask containing 20 mL TY with 50 mg/L Rif, 50 mg/L Kan, and 200 μM AS.\nGrow overnight (8–12 h) at 120 rpm at 30°C until OD600 reaches 1.0–2.0.\nTransfer Agrobacterium cultures to 1.5-mL Eppendorf tubes and centrifuge at 5,000 g for 1 min to pellet the bacteria; resuspend the pellet in ∼20 mL of liquid MSD medium containing 200 μM AS for a final OD600 of ∼0.15.",
    "Note: The final OD600 needs to be in the range of 0.1–0.2 for effective transformation.\nSoak the calli in Agrobacterium suspension for 30–60 min in a Petri dish at room temperature (20°C–25°C) and shake it gently every 10 min.\nRemove Agrobacteria suspension with a pipette and blot the calli dry on sterile filter paper.\nPlace the calli onto a new MSD plate containing 200 μM AS and co-culture with Agrobacteria for 3–5 days at 20°C–25°C in the dark (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nSelection and regeneration of transgenic rice calli.\nTransfer the calli onto new MSD/Hygromycin B/Timentin plates (∼30 calli/plate) and incubate for 2 weeks in a growth chamber (16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod at 28°C, or constant light at 28°C).\nNote: Calli will turn brown at this step. Check plates every day for overgrowth of Agrobacteria.\nThe calli are sub-cultured on new MSD/Hygromycin B/Timentin plates (∼12–15 calli/plate) from 2 weeks to 2 months until tiny nodular embryos grow on the surface of resistant calli (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nNote: True transgenic calli grow fast and as a loose mass; false positives grow as a very dense mass that is sticky.\nTransfer the Hygromycin-resistant calli (light yellow, dry, and growing loosely) to regeneration RM plates and grow for 2 weeks.\nNote: Number each callus on the side wall of the new plate to help distinguish them. The calli should be gently embedded in the agar surface by pressing the agar with forceps; this step will prevent later confusion caused by calli sliding along the surface; separate new resistant calli as much as possible. Transgenic calli will gradually turn green.\nSub-culture green callus tissue on new regeneration RM plates (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E) every 2 weeks until plantlets grow.\nNote: Four transfers are sufficient; if no green shoots appear after this step, start over.",
    "Transfer the regenerated plantlets to culture tubes containing half-strength MS medium (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F) for root regeneration. Cover each tube with breathable sealing film for 1–2 weeks.\nRemove sealing film and harden off tender seedlings for 4–6 days.\nTransfer healthy seedlings into 50 × 80-cm plastic pots containing a 3:1 (w/w) mixture of field soil and vermiculite. Place all pots in a glasshouse (day/night temperatures of 28°C/20°C, 10-h-light/14-h-dark photoperiod).\nGenotyping of genome-edited plants\nTiming: 3–4 days (for step 19)\nThis section describes genome DNA extraction and PCR amplification to identify potential mutations in the target region in transgenic lines.\nRice genomic DNA extraction.\nCollect leaf blades in 1.5-mL Eppendorf tubes, add a 5-mm-diameter stainless steel bead to each tube, and immediately freeze in liquid nitrogen.\nRemove Eppendorf tubes from liquid nitrogen and quickly place them on a Tissuelyser (50 Hz, 1 min).\nAdd 600 μL 2× CTAB DNA extraction buffer.\nIncubate the mixture at 65°C for 45 min and mix every 10–15 min.\nAdd 500 μL of chloroform and mix for 1 min.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 g for 10 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nTransfer the upper aqueous phase into new tubes, add 400 μL of isopropanol, and mix well.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 g for 10 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nWash the pellet with 75% (v/v) ethanol for 5 min.\nAir dry the pellets and resuspend genomic DNA in 50 μL ddH2O.\nPCR amplification.\nRun standard PCR amplification (30–35 cycles) on a thermal cycler. PCR reaction:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2173_18.csv\nPCR cycling conditions:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2173_19.csv\nSeparate PCR products on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel.\nSequencing.
