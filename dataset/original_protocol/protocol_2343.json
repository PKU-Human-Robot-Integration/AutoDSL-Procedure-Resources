    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nMouse Infection\nTiming: ∼2 h\nIn this step we infect the mice intranasally with 103 CFU of our bacterial strains.\nThaw the bacterial aliquot for mice infection at 20°C–25˚C (room temperature), passage it through a BD Tuberculin Syringe with a 25G-needle for ∼15× (to breakup bacterial clumps) and dilute in infection buffer to a final concentration of 4 × 104 bacteria/mL (103 bacteria in 25 μL of infection buffer).\nNote: For cell sorting in the later part of the protocol, we add an additional mouse infected with WT Mtb, which will be stained and used as an FMO (fluorescence minus one) control for the mCherry Mtb signal.\nMice are anesthetized using an isoflurane and oxygen mixture (5% isoflurane in oxygen at 4.5 liters/min; VIP 3000 isoflurane vaporizer) for ∼2 min, until the animals are sedated, and the breath slows.\n25 μL (103 bacteria) are then administered intranasally to each mouse.\nNote: Mice infected with different strains are kept in different cages for the duration of the infection. In the original Dual RNA-seq paper we infected the mice and kept them in cages for 14 days as we were interested in examining a dynamic timepoint in between innate immunity and onset of the adaptive immune response. Typical timepoints examined during an Mtb murine infection are 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks (covering the transition from the innate to the adaptive immune response) and 6–8 weeks (for steady-state or chronic infection).\nGeneration of a Single-Cell Suspension and Antibody Staining\nTiming: ∼1 h with the GentleMacs or ∼2 h with the manual protocol\nPrepare (n= number of mice in the experiment) GentleMacs C tubes filled with 4 mL of the dissociation solution.\nEuthanize the mice using an approved procedure.\nSpray the mice with 70% ethanol.

Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B\nCarefully open the thorax performing a midline incision, cutting away the diaphragm and removing the lateral chest walls to expose the lungs.

Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D\nPlace the lobes from each mouse in a single GentleMacs C tube. Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E\nRun the appropriate GentleMacs protocol for your application in order to obtain a single-cell suspension. For the previous Dual RNA-seq paper we used the “37C_m_LDK_1” program.\nNote: if a GentleMacs dissociator is not available, proceed with the manual generation of the single-cell suspension from the mouse lungs:\nPlace lung lobes in a well of a 6-well plate. Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F\nUsing scissors, mince the lobes in very small pieces until they become mostly homogenous and smooth.

    "Note: cut the end of the 1 mL tips to avoid blockage. Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H\nIncubate at 37˚C, with the falcon tubes lying flat in a shaking incubator (60 rpm) for 60 min.\nNote: Because of the success of the current protocol we have not explored whether variations in temperature or incubation time improves cell fitness.\nAt the end of the incubation, vortex the lung suspension.\nPass the lung suspension through a 70 uM cell strainer and filter. Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]L\nNote: if you performed the manual dissociation, use the internal part of a 10 mL syringe or an appropriate instrument to push the remaining pieces of the lobes through the nylon mesh of the cell strainer. Add staining solution as appropriate to let the suspension flow through the strainer and into the 50 mL Falcon tube. Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]M\nSpin down 5 min at 400 × g.\nSlowly remove the supernatant, paying attention to not touch the cell pellet at the bottom of the Falcon tube.\nResuspend in 1 mL of ACK lysis buffer to lyse red blood cells.\nIncubate for 5 min at 20°C–25°C\nCritical: Do not exceed 5 min of incubation time.\nImmediately add 9 mL of staining solution to the lung suspension.\nSpin down 5 min at 400 × g.\nSlowly remove the supernatant. Resuspend in 4 mL of staining solution.\nPass the lung suspension through a 40 uM cell strainer and filter.\nSpin down 5 min at 400 × g.\nOptional: Remove the supernatant and resuspend in 1 mL of Fc blocking solution (Staining solution + Fc block (anti CD16/32 for mouse)). Transfer to a 2 mL Eppendorf tube and incubate for 15 min at 4˚C. Spin down at 500 × g for 3 min.",
    "In the meantime, prepare the antibody mixture for staining. (In our previous Dual RNA-seq paper we used a mixture of CD64, MertK and SiglecF antibodies to distinguish between alveolar and interstitial macrophages at a concentration of 1:200).\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the lung pellet with the antibody mix in staining solution at the appropriate concentration.\nIncubate for 20 min in the dark at 20°C–25˚C.\nSpin down at 1200 × g for 3 min.\nRemove the supernatant and wash twice with 1 mL of PBS 1×.\nResuspend in sorting buffer at an appropriate dilution based on the characteristics of your sorter, passing the lung suspension through a 40 uM cell strainer right before sorting, to avoid the formation of clumps that may clog the nozzle of the instrument.\nCritical: keep the ready-to-sort samples at 4˚C or on ice while you prepare the cell sorter.\nSorting\nTiming: variable, depending on the speed of the instrument\nFill 2 mL Eppendorf tubes (one for each sample) with ∼700 μL of Trizol reagent to collect the sorted cells.\nNote: This amount depends on the configuration of your machine. We usually get about ∼150 μL of sorting volume for 30k cells.\nCritical: We suggest to keep at least a 1:4 ratio for the volume of sorted cells vs Trizol. (ex: for 150 μL of sorted cells use at least 600 μL of Trizol).\nPrepare the sorting gates, acquire and start sorting keeping the samples at 4˚C during the process, in order to minimize unwanted changes in the expression profile of both host and bacteria.\nSort the infected cells directly into Trizol.\nAt the end of the sorting process immediately mix the samples, manually rocking the tubes 5 times to allow dissociation of the nucleoprotein complexes of the host cells.\nIncubate for 5 min at 20°C–25˚C.",
    "Place at −80˚C or proceed to the following section of the protocol.\nPause Point: (at this stage we usually leave the samples at −80˚C for not more than 2 days)\nRNA Extraction\nTiming: ∼2 days\nFollowing sorting into Trizol, the host cell RNA will be free in the supernatant, while the bacteria will be for the most part still intact. The rationale is to use a high speed centrifugation step to separate bacteria and cell debris as a pellet at the bottom of the tube. Because of the limited number of infected host cells recoverable from an in vivo experiment, we developed what we call a “one tube procedure” for RNA extraction, in order to minimize loss of material. Therefore, following centrifugation, the Trizol supernatant should be removed carefully, to minimize the potential loss of bacteria. Following the removal of the Trizol supernatant containing the host RNA, we perform mechanical disruption of the pelleted bacteria and add back part of the Trizol supernatant, to generate a more favorable bacteria/host RNA ratio.\nWe were able to recover sufficient RNA to generate a library from as low as 20k infected host cells.\nNote: all of the reagents that we use in this step are certified DNase and RNase free.\nThaw Trizol samples at 20°C–25˚C, if frozen.\nCentrifuge samples at high speed (≥12,000 × g) for 20 min.\nSlowly remove ∼90% of the volume of the Trizol supernatant (containing host RNA) and set aside in a new 2 mL Eppendorf tube, leaving ∼150 μL behind.\nNote: Leave a small amount of Trizol behind to avoid disturbing the bacteria/cell debris pellet. For 2 mL Eppendorf tubes we typically leave behind ∼150 μL.",
    "Critical: In many cases, when only a limited amount of infected cells have been recovered (<100k), you will not be able to see a pellet by eye. Therefore, after the centrifugation we suggest to mark the side of the tube where the pellet is located and remove the tubes from the centrifuge very carefully. Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/197-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Resuspending the Bacterial/Cell Debris Pellet in Trizol and Zirconia Beads\n(A) ~150ul of Trizol supernatant is left behind in the tube containing the bacterial/cell debris pellet.\n(B) 150ul of Zirconia Beads and 400ul of fresh Trizol are added to the same tube.\nAdd 150 μL of Zirconia beads to the tube containing the bacterial pellet.\nAdd 400 μL of fresh Trizol to the same tube (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nPerform bead beating using the homogenizer setting (BioSpec – Mini-Bead Beater with 8 speed controller) or at max speed for 2 cycles of 1 min, resting on ice 2 min between the cycles.\nAfter bead beating, mix well by manually inverting the tubes 5 times.\nLet the samples rest for 2 min at 20°C–25˚C.\nRe-add part of the volume of the Trizol containing the host cell RNA that you set aside in step 36 to the tube with the zirconia beads.\nCritical: The amount of Trizol you will add back depends on the number of cells recovered during the sorting process and the infection rate.\nFor in vivo experiments and recovery of ∼30k infected cells we typically add back 70% of the Trizol supernatant. We usually achieve between 2%–3% of reads mapping to Mtb.\nFor in vitro experiments (BMM or HMDM infected at an MOI of 4:1), we sort 45k infected cells and put back ∼40%–50% of the Trizol supernatant. We usually achieve between ∼8% to ∼10% of reads mapping to Mtb.",
    "Note: The goal here is to find a balance between adding back sufficient host RNA to have the critical mass of rRNA-depleted mRNA needed for library preparation and avoiding having too much host RNA that would lead to a low percentage of reads mapping to Mtb.\nMix well by inverting the tubes 5–6 times.\nAdd the appropriate amount of Chloroform to each sample (200 μL for 1 mL of Trizol).\nMix, shaking vigorously for 15 s.\nIncubate 2 min at 20°C–25˚C.\nCentrifuge 15 min at 12,000 × g.\nCarefully transfer the aqueous phase to a new 1.5 mL RNase-free eppendorf tube.\nCritical: Pay attention not to carry over any part of the organic phase. Leave behind a small amount of clear aqueous phase. Carry over of contaminants from the organic phase will lead to isolation of poor-quality RNA.\nAdd 2 μL of Glycoblue to each sample (follow manufacturer instructions: flick well but do not pipette to mix, quick spin, and put the tubes on ice.)\nAdd the appropriate amount of Isopropanol to each sample (flick well to mix, do not pipette). For 1 mL of Trizol, add 500 μL of Isopropanol.\nWipe out the tubes and take out of BSL3.\nIncubate at least 1 h at −80˚C (at this stage we typically leave the samples at −80˚C).\nThaw the frozen samples at 20°C–25˚C.\nCritical: before starting, we suggest cleaning pipettes, bench, and gloves with a product such as RNase-zap to remove possible sources of RNase contamination.\nCentrifuge 20 min at 12,000 × g, at 4˚C.\nRemove the supernatant using a wide-bore pipette tip. You should now be able to see the nucleic acid pellet colored in blue at the bottom of the tube.",
    "Wash with 75% ice-cold ethanol. Flick to loosen the pellet. For 1 mL of Trizol, use 1 mL of 75% ice-cold ethanol.\nCentrifuge 15 min at 7,400 × g, at 4˚C.\nPipette off as much ethanol as possible without disturbing the pellet.\nAir dry the pellet in a clean place.\nCritical: do not over-dry the pellet. Remove as much ethanol as possible before air-drying the pellet using a 20 μL tip. Over-drying will make it harder to resuspend the RNA in step 60. Also, air dry the pellet in a clean, RNase-free location.\nResuspend each RNA pellet vigorously in 12 μL of Nuclease free water.\nIncubate at 20°C–25˚C for 2 min, flick to mix and store on ice (if proceeding to the next step) or at −80˚C for long term storage.\nDNase Treatment, rRNA Removal, and Library Construction\nIn many cases the following steps will usually be performed by the RNA-seq core of your institution. For the most part we follow the standard manufacturer protocols with very slight modifications as detailed here:\nDnase treatment: we use the commercially available Turbo-DNA free kit (Invitrogen), following manufacturer instructions with no modifications.\nrRNA removal:\nAfter DNase treatment, quantify the amount of total RNA recovered. Ex: from 30k sorted infected macrophages we usually recover ∼50/60 ng of total RNA.\nNote: We strongly suggest the use of the Qubit instrument for this step (RNA high sensitivity kit), as quantification with the Nanodrop of very low amounts of RNA is imprecise.\nAnalyze the quality of the RNA by Fragment Analyzer.\nCritical: Before proceeding to the rRNA-depletion step make sure the rRNA peaks are clearly visible and the RNA is for the most part intact. Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/197-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Examples of a Fragment Analyzer Track",
    "(A) In the top right corner is the expected result of the Fragment Analyzer track when following this protocol. RQN values <6 may lead to inefficient rRNA removal when using the Ribo-Zero or similar kits.\n(B) Example of a Bioanalyzer track of the final library from one of our low input dual RNA-seq samples.\nNote: Highly degraded RNA (RIN <6) will strongly decrease the efficiency of the rRNA-depletion step.\nrRNA removal is performed using 50–100 ng of total RNA input and a minor modification to the manufacturer protocol for the Ribo-Zero Epidemiology Gold rRNA removal kit (Illumina) https://cornell.box.com/s/ajqggp6xpkg768456mzflgph2qlrsbj4[href=https://cornell.box.com/s/ajqggp6xpkg768456mzflgph2qlrsbj4]. Briefly, 90 μL bead stock is used per sample in step A, while 2 μL each of reaction buffer and removal solution in a 20 μL reaction volume are used in step B, as detailed in the manufacturer’s protocol. The final rRNA-depleted samples are purified by ethanol precipitation following the Ribo-Zero protocol.\nAlternatively, a 1:1 mix of depletion solutions from the H/M/R and Bacteria NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kits can be used to remove rRNA. The final rRNA-depleted samples are purified using RNA Sample Purification Beads.",
    "Library preparation: Sequencing libraries are generated using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs) using half of the rRNA-depleted sample (no quantification), with 15 min fragmentation time in first-strand reaction buffer (Protocol Chapter 2 [NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kits; 1:1 mix of depletion reagents] or Chapter 4 [Illumina Ribo-Zero Epidemiology Depletion]). We follow the manufacturer instructions with 5-fold adapter dilution, except that only half of the cDNA sample is used as input for PCR (12 cycles) to allow for a second amplification reaction if needed to adjust the barcode index or the number of PCR cycles. The total yield per library is typically ∼20–100 ng (1–5 ng/μL in 20 μL, determined with HS DNA Qubit assay). Higher or lower total yields may require adjustments in the number of PCR cycles. The library size distribution is determined on a Fragment Analyzer. Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B\nSequencing: Libraries are pooled based on estimated molarity and sequenced on a NextSeq500 (Illumina) in multiple rounds until the desired sequencing depth for bacterial reads is reached (target ∼1 M Mtb reads). Libraries are also compatible with sequencing on other Illumina instruments, however, adjustments may be recommended during library preparation for longer read lengths (less fragmentation time, adjustments to bead cleanup steps); see NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit, Appendix A).\nExpected Outcomes\nThe amount of total RNA recovered correlates with the number of infected cells that have been processed: for ∼30k cells we usually recover ∼50–60 ng of total RNA.\nQuality of RNA should be assessed by Fragment Analyzer. Ideally, the Fragment Analyzer track should show very small amount of RNA degradation (clear rRNA picks) and should be free of genomic DNA contamination.",
    "Libraries should have a total yield of 20–100 ng (1–5 ng/μL in 20 μL) with a size distribution centered on ∼300 bp (anticipating 75nt SE reads).\nYou should expect to obtain between 2%–3% of the total reads to align to the Mtb transcriptome for an in vivo experiment, and higher numbers for in vitro experiments when using MOI 2:1.\nQuantification and Statistical Analysis\nData Analysis\nTiming: variable (between 1 and 5 days), depending on the sequencing depth\nHere we provide an in-depth description of the pipeline we used for the analysis of the sequencing files in the original Dual RNA-seq paper. After sequencing, Mtb and host reads are mixed together in the same FASTQ file for each sample. Furthermore, even after rRNA-depletion a certain number of unwanted rRNA reads are present in the sample files. The strategy we use is to first separate and quantify the rRNA reads present in each sample (this is useful as a benchmark to evaluate the efficiency of the rRNA-depletion step). After the rRNA reads are removed, for each sample, we proceed to separate Mtb and host cell reads into two different FASTQ files . At this point, reads for each organism are aligned against the respective reference genome and we count the number of times a sequence from each gene was present in our data. We then use the framework provided by the DESeq2 package for the differential gene expression analysis.\nPerform quality control of the fastq files with FastQC.\nRemove low quality reads and trim Illumina Adapter. We used Flexbar 3.4 for this step with the following parameters:\n--adapter-min-overlap 7 --max-uncalled 2 --min-read-length 50 -aa TruSeq -q TAIL -qf i1.8 -qt 20 --qtrim-post-removal",
    "Remove rRNA reads using Bowtie2 and a custom fasta file containing rRNA regions from both organisms. We used the following settings in Bowtie2 to separate rRNA and mRNA reads:\n--sensitive --al rRNA.fastq --un mRNA.fastq\nSeparate Mtb and host cells reads with Bowtie2:\n--very-sensitive --al TB.fastq --un Mouse.fastq\nAlign Mtb and mouse reads using Hisat2. If you use a directional library preparation kit, specify the strandness of the reads. For our Dual-seq paper where we used the “NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library prep kit” that would be “reverse.” For example:\nhisat2 --rg-id=TB_AM1 --rg SM:TB_AM1 --rg LB:TB_AM1 --dta -x tb_index --rna-strandness R -U TB_AM1.fastq -S TB_AM1.sam\nSort, convert, and index the SAM and BAM files.\nUse HTSeq to generate a raw read counts matrix for each organism.\nImport the raw reads count matrix in R and perform differential expression using DESeq2 and APEGLM for log-fold change estimation.\nNote: The entire pipeline, including linux commands and the R scripts that we used in the original Dual RNA-seq paper are available here: https://cornell.box.com/s/vkbz5n5egy6e7v4fzbowsd5hx9qtmxr9[href=https://cornell.box.com/s/vkbz5n5egy6e7v4fzbowsd5hx9qtmxr9].\nStatistical Testing\nStatistical testing for the differential gene expression analysis (DGE) is performed as described (Love et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Shrinkage of effect sizes (LFC estimates) is performed using the APEGLM method (Zhu et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). Genes with less than 10 raw counts across all samples are excluded from downstream analysis. Genes having a false discovery rate (FDR) 0.05 and a fold change 1.5 are considered significant. Visualization and clustering (PCA, heatmaps of sample-to-sample distances) are performed on variance stabilized counts (vst) (Anders and Huber, 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]) with the option “blind = TRUE” in the DESeq2 package in order to compare samples in an unbiased manner. Heatmaps for specific groups of genes are generated using the normalized counts obtained from the DESeq2 analysis, log-transformed and Z-scaled using the package heatmap2 in R.",
    "The raw datasets needed to repeat the analysis published in Cell Reports are available on GEO: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE132354[href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE132354].\nLimitations\nThe protocol has been developed for the use with Mtb, a bacteria with a strong cell wall that is resistant to immediate dissociation in Trizol/GTC (guanidine thiocyanate). Although we have not yet tested this, it is possible that the protocol may work with other Gram+ bacteria, particularly if isolation of nucleic acids requires mechanical disruption of the cell wall, comparable to Mtb.\nOur approach is based on adjusting the ratio of bacteria/host RNA, therefore the protocol will not work in all those situations where sorting and isolation of infected cells is not possible (ex: most human disease samples). Because the average amount of total RNA for each bacterial cell is ∼0.1 pg vs 20 pg of RNA for a host cell (Westermann et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]), even small proportions of non-infected cells in your sample (ex:20%) will skew the bacteria/host RNA ratio in an unfavorable way and therefore recovering enough Mtb reads will require deep sequencing, with all the economic limitations associated with it. Finally, the protocol will not work with archived, PFA fixed materials.\nTroubleshooting\nProblem\nPoor total RNA quality in the Fragment Analyzer track.\nPotential Solution\nA degraded Fragment Analyzer track may arise from a multitude of different issues. The followings are some aspects to take into consideration:\nMake sure to remove the host RNA in step 36 of the RNA extraction protocol and set it aside on a RNase-free tube. Performing bead beating on a large amount of host RNA will lead to poor-quality isolation.\nMake sure to use RNase-free certified reagents during the RNA extraction process and beyond.",
    "Do not air dry the RNA pellet at 37˚C, but only at 20°C–25˚C and only for short periods of time (we usually air dry the pellet for 20 min at 20°C–25˚C ). Do not leave the RNA pellet at 20°C–25˚C for 1 h.\nKeep the RNA on ice whenever possible and store it at −80˚C for long term storage.\nMake sure to cleanse all pipettes and tips with a product capable of removing RNase contamination.\nProblem\nLow yields of total RNA extracted. Not enough rRNA-depleted mRNA to prepare a library for sequencing.\nPotential Solution\nIn our experience low RNA yields arise in the following situations:\nRemoval of too much host RNA in step 42 of the RNA extraction protocol. You should consider the host RNA as a carrier for the bacterial RNA. With 30–40k infected cells, you only have ∼80–100k bacteria which equals to 2 ng of total RNA. Therefore, removing more 50% volume of the host RNA, will lead to poor total RNA yields for the mixed total RNA. We suggest to never remove more than 50% of host RNA.\nPoor recovery of the sorted cells in the collection tubes. We suggest to accurately control and check the deflection points of your sorting instrument, to make sure all the sorted droplets end up in the collection tubes. This is very important when you are only collecting 30k infected cells.\nLosing the RNA pellet during the precipitation step. We suggest to use the Glycoblue reagent in order to help visualize the nucleic acids pellet.\nRNase contamination. Check that all reagents are certified DNase and RNase free.\nProblem\nSmall insert size in Illumina libraries, or reads that extend through the insert or overlap (for PE reads).\nPotential Solution",
    "Use the recommended modifications in the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit protocol, Appendix A, to increase library insert size.\nProblem\nSignificant peak at ∼135 bp indicating 10% adaptor dimer (molarity) in the Illumina library.\nPotential Solution\nUse more RNA input for rRNA depletion or for library preparation, or increase the fold dilution of the NEBNext adaptor.\n0.8X SPRI beads cleanup might also help to exclude any fragment below 200 bp. However, additional cleanup step may result in loss of material. If working with low yield libraries and using the NEBNext library preparation kit presented in this protocol, we suggest increasing the fold dilution of the NEBNext adaptor.\nProblem\nIllumina library total yields 1 ng (0.5 ng/μL in 20 μL) or 400 ng (20 ng/μL in 20 μL) for libraries of size ∼250–350 bp (adjust accordingly for larger insert sizes).\nPotential Solution\nAdjust PCR cycle number. Because adding more PCR cycles always introduces some PCR bias and we do not have UMIs to identify and remove reads that originate from PCR duplicates, we process the samples starting from the one with the lower amount and we keep the PCR cycle number a constant (as well as input amount) for the entire project so that any bias is as similar as possible across all samples in the experiment.\nProblem\nLow percentage of reads mapping to the Mtb transcriptome.\nPotential Solution\nMake sure to not lose the bacterial/cell debris pellet in step 36 of the RNA extraction protocol. Remove the tubes from the centrifuge very carefully, mark the spot where the bacterial pellet is supposed to be and slowly remove the supernatant leaving behind a small amount of Trizol.",
    "Make sure to use an FMO control for cell sorting. This is essential for setting up the sorting gate for the mCherry signal: contamination of cells that are not infected with the bacteria during cell sorting (whose signal arise from autofluorescence or from spillover from other channels) will lead to low percentage of reads mapping to Mtb.\nMake sure to select the correct strandness of the reads in the data analysis steps.\nResource Availability\nLead Contact\nFurther information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, [David G.
