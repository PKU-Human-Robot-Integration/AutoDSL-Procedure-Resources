    "The rat knee immobilization model used has been approved by the University of Ottawa Animal Care and Veterinary Service and the local ethics committee.\n1. Animal Preparation\nAt the end of the predetermined immobilization period, euthanize the rats by administration of carbon dioxide.\n\tNOTE: Here we used an immobilization model with a plate and 2 screws (one inserted in the proximal femur and the other in the distal tibia), which avoids violation of any knee joint structures, and maintains a knee-flexed position of 135° as described previously6. Over a period of time, this produces a knee flexion contracture11.\nCover the area both on and around the surface that the arthrometer will be placed upon with absorbent, water-proof protection pads. Wear gloves, lab coat, and eye protection, while completing the experiment.\nUsing a scalpel, divide the skin to expose the plate and screws (see the note following step 1.1); insert the more proximal screw in the proximal femur and insert the more distal screw in the distal tibia. Palpate to locate the screws. Once the screw heads are accessible, remove the screw using a screwdriver.\n\tNOTE: During the period of immobilization, the heads of the screws may become covered by soft tissue. If this occurs, use the scalpel to gently remove the tissue and uncover the screw heads.\nOnce the screws are removed, remove the plate manually or using forceps from a dissection kit.\nUsing scissors and forceps, deglove the lower extremity to remove skin from underlying fascia.\n2. Animal Positioning on the Motor-driven Arthrometer\nNOTE: All testing should be performed at room temperature. Here the arthrometer is powered by a standard North American 120 V input. The adapter output is 12 V and 500 mA.",
    "Position the animal to be tested on its side with the experimental leg (the leg to be tested) facing upwards (Figure 2).\n\t\nSecure the femur in the grooved metal clamp that is integrated into the mounting stage of the arthrometer. Punch holes through the muscle using a precision screwdriver to place the clamp distal to the greater trochanter and secure the femur. Adjust the lateral femoral condyle over the center of rotation of the arthrometer (Figure 1, 2).\nPosition the movable arm with two upright posts behind the leg, just superior to the calcaneus, to push the knee into passive extension once the electric motor is activated.\nTighten the femur clamp at its base using a hex key until it is secured.\nEnsure the camera is correctly mounted on the arthrometer using a screwdriver and is on Manual Focus. Focus the camera on the femoral condyle.\nSelect the direction setting on the arthrometer (clockwise or counterclockwise) depending on the direction of the knee ROM being tested and the position of the rat.\nActivate the arthrometer motor by simultaneously pushing the Power and Start button.\n\tNOTE: The necessity of pushing the power and start button simultaneously is a safety feature of the device, which prevents accidental activation.\n\t\nObserve that the arthrometer motor will move at a speed of 6.6 RPM and then stop for 2.1 s upon reaching the first pre-set torque.\nNOTE: that when the first torque is reached, the corresponding LED will light up and the digital camera will take a picture of the knee automatically.",
    "NOTE: Once the picture is taken, the arthrometer will continue to the next, higher preset torque. Once the four torques have been applied, the arthrometer will stop. Once the rat is positioned on the arthrometer and testing is initiated, the total time for testing one knee is approximately 18.8 s. Times may vary slightly depending on the condition of the joint contracture. The images taken are used to measure the extension at each torque.\n3. Capturing the Angle of Knee Extension Using the Motor-driven Arthrometer\nNOTE: Once the motor has stopped at each applied torque, a digital camera is triggered to take a picture. The camera is positioned on the frame such that it is directly above the knee joint being tested and focused on the femoral condyle.\nContinue testing with the same knee from the same animal but in a different situation, e.g., after a myotomy of the posterior transarticular muscles is performed to isolate the arthrogenic (non-muscular) component of a contracture, or with a knee from another animal.\n\t\nWhen completing the myotomy, dissect the muscle proximal enough to the knee joint to ensure that the capsule is not cut.\n\t\tNOTE: It is easiest to complete the myotomy when the leg is in extension, following application of torque setting 4 (17.53 N-cm). Then, repeat steps 2.1 through 3.1.\nOnce both legs have been tested in all conditions (e.g., before and after myotomy), dispose of the animal carcass and all biohazardous materials following institutional protocol, and clean the arthrometer.\n4. Knee ROM Measurement Analysis\nAnalyze ROM using ImageJ.\n\tNOTE: Here version 1.45s was used.\nOpen the file containing the digital image taken by the camera mounted on the rat arthrometer.\n\tNOTE: The person performing the analysis should be blinded to the experimental grouping of the animal (e.g., immobilized versus control).",
    "Select the Angle tool from the main toolbar and trace the femorotibial angle by drawing a femoral line from the middle of the femur clamp to the lateral condyle (aligned with the femoral diaphysis, Figure 2), and a tibial line from the lateral femoral condyle to the lateral malleolus (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: The femoro-tibial angle corresponds to the maximal angle of knee extension reached at each preset torque.\nUse the measuring tool by clicking Analyze| Measure to show the calculated angle produced by the 2 lines drawn above. Use the convention of 0° to mean full extension.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
