    "All experimental protocols involving human iPSCs were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Department of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University.\n1. Human iPSCs Preparation Before Induction\nNOTE: Culture human iPSCs (201B7-PAX3-GFP) on SNL feeder cells16 with primate ES cell medium supplemented with 4 ng/mL recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) and 0.5% penicillin and streptomycin (hereinafter referred to as hESC medium, see Table 1). When the confluence ratio reaches 70%–80%, passage the cells as previously described17.\nPassaging of human iPSCs on SNL feeder cells17\nFor passaging, add PBS into the cell culturing dish and rinse cells. Then, remove the PBS (hereafter, this process will be referred to as wash with PBS).\nAdd 1 mL of CTK solution (see Table 1) at room temperature (RT) and wait until the SNL feeder cells start detaching from the bottom of the dish.\nRemove the CTK solution and then wash twice with PBS.\nAdd 1 mL of hESC medium (see Table 1) into the dish, then scrape the cells using a scraper and collect into a 15 mL conical tube.\nGently pipette the contents five times using a 1,000 µL tip, and then transfer to a new dish filled with hESC medium. Use a split ratio of 1:4 to 1:10, depending on the confluence ratio before passaging. Also, vary the volume of hESC medium depending on the scale of the dish (e.g., 3 mL for a 6 cm dish, 8 mL for a 10 cm dish).\nIncubate the human iPSCs at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nChange the medium everyday (except for the day after passaging) and culture the cells until the next passaging procedure.\nFeeder-free culturing of human iPSCs before PSM induction",
    "NOTE: To minimize the effect of growth factors secreted from SNL feeder cells, culture the human iPSCs under feeder-free conditions with a feeder-free cell culture medium (see Table 1) on extracellular matrix (ECM) solutions (see Table 1) coated dish for 3 days prior to PSM induction.\n\t\nDay -4 (4 days prior to starting PSM induction)\n\t\t\nTo prepare the ECM solution-coated dish, add 4 mL of ECM solution onto a 10 cm dish at 4 °C overnight.\nNOTE: Place ECM solution on ice while preparing.\nDay -3\n\t\t\nFirst, remove the ECM solution from the dish and add 8 mL of feeder-free cell culture medium.\nTo start feeder-free culturing, wash once with PBS to rinse the cultured cells.\nAdd 1 mL of CTK solution at RT until the SNL feeder cells start detaching from the bottom of the dish.\nNOTE: Use microscopy to confirm all feeder cells are detached from the bottom.\nRemove the CTK solution and wash with PBS twice, so that all SNL feeder cells are fully removed.\nAdd 1 mL of feeder-free cell culture medium into the dish, then scrape the cells using a scraper and collect them into a 15 mL conical tube.\nGently pipette the contents three times using a 1,000 µL tip, then transfer to a new ECM solution-coated 10 cm dish (prepared during step 1.2.1). Use a split ratio of roughly 1:2 to 1:4, depending on the confluence ratio before feeder-free culturing.\nIncubate the human iPSCs at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 3 days, changing the medium on day -1.\n2.
