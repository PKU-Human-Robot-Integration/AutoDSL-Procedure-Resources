    "Grow MΦ in two 75 cm2 culture flasks (20 ml total volume) in RPMI- complete media until 80% (flask A) and 25% (flask B) confluency (Note 1).  Condition: The cell cultures are maintained in an incubator with 5% CO2 and 37 °C, including incubation steps. Day 1   Remove old media, add fresh media (same volume) and detach MΦ with a 25 cm cell scraper from the flask A.   Carefully pipette culture up and down until pellet is dissolved.   Leave 5 ml of the cell suspension in the flask A and add 15 ml of RPMI-complete media.   Centrifuge remaining 15 ml of MΦ cell suspension in two 15 ml Falcon tubes at 1,200 rpm for 5 min (Note 2).   Remove supernatant and re-suspend pellet in the same volume of RPMI-Strep media (7.5 ml for each falcon tube) (Note 3).    Count MΦ in the Neubauer cell counter with Trypan blue viability dye (use 10 μl of cell suspension with 10 μl of dye) and use approximately 0.7-1.3 x 106 cells/ml for activation. Allow the dye to stain for approximately 5 to 15 min. If cells are exposed to extended period of time to this dye, viable cells, as well as nonviable cells, may begin to uptake dye.   Transfer this amount of cells into a 25 cm2 flask (8 ml total volume) and activate them with CpG-ODN at a final concentration of 2 µg/µl for 24 h (Note 4).    Grow E. coli - CFP (or YFP) bacterial population from the frozen stock in RPMI-Strep media in the 12-well plates (3 ml of the total volume for each well) for 24 h in the same conditions as the cell cultures (CO2 incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2) (Note 5). Day 2   Repeat steps 2-8 with MΦ from the flask B.",
    "Repeat steps 2-3 with activated MΦ from flask A (use a 16 cm scraper).   Centrifuge MΦ cell suspension in one 15 ml Falcon tube at 1,000 rpm for 5 min and resuspend using RPMI-Strep at the same volume.   After counting the cells, seed activated MΦ at 0.8-1.6 x 106 cells/ml in 12-well microtiter plates (3 ml of total volume for each well).   Allow cells to attach in the 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 2 h.   Count numbers of grown bacteria by using 2 μm size beads in the Flow cytometer (Note 6).    Wash activated and attached MΦ with RPMI-Strep media (remove old and add new media, same volume).   Infect activated MΦ at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 to 1 (106 bacteria/ml to 106 MΦ/ml).  Day 3   Repeat steps 2-8 with MΦ from the flask A.   Repeat steps 2-3 with activated MΦ from flask B (use a 16 cm scraper).   Centrifuge MΦ cell suspension in one 15 ml falcon tube at 1,000 rpm for 5 min and resuspend using RPMI-Strep at the same volume.   After counting the cells, seed activated MΦ at 0.8-1.6 x 106 cells/ml in 12-well microtiter plates (3 ml of total volume for each well) and allow cells to attach in the 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator for 2 h.   After 24 h of infection (12-well infection plate from the Day 2), detach MΦ with a 16 cm cell scraper and centrifuge culture at 4,000 rpm for 10 min. This procedure lyses MΦ and releases intracellular bacteria (Note 7).   Discard the supernatant and resuspend each pellet in 3 ml of PBS.   Dilute bacteria in PBS, count their numbers in flow cytometer.",
    "Use this bacteria to infect activated MΦ again (from flask B) at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 to 1 (106 bacteria/ml to 106 MΦs/ml).    Freeze a sample of the bacterial culture every day and keep your stocks (“fossil records”) at -80 °C.   Repeat steps from Day 2 and Day 3 to continue with evolution experiment (Note 8)."
