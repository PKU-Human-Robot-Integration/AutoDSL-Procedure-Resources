    "The series of studies in the present paper were approved by Gunma University Ethical Review Board for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects.\nNOTE: Inclusion criteria for participants were the ability to understand the use of minimal force and the ability to perform the task with the thumb and index finger. Exclusion criteria were selected based on the purpose of the experiments.\n1. Equipment preparation\nConnect two sensor connector cables to the USB ports of a computer. Pull up the lever attached to the sensor connector and insert the sensor’s tab into the insertion slot. Return the attached lever to its original position.\nOpen the sensor software on a computer. Make sure that real-time pressure distribution maps appear automatically on the monitor when the sensor sheets are correctly connected.\nPressure adjustment\n\t\nInsert the sensing area of the sensor sheet one by one into a compressor rig.\nTurn on the air valve of the compressor’s controller and start to apply pressure. Operate the regulator and adjust to the appropriate load value (i.e., 172 kPa) to check the indicator on the controller. Make sure that the whole area of the sensor sheet is equally pressurized on the monitor.\nWhile applying pressure to the sensor sheets, perform equilibration and calibration.\n\tNOTE: Equilibration is an operation to adjust the reactivity of the sensor cells equally. Calibration is an operation to convert the pressure on the sensor sheet (raw sum) into a unit of weight (grams or Newtons) and display it. Both must be done for the sensor sheet before starting data collection for each participant.\n\t\nSelect Tools | Equilibration on the software main window. Click Equilibrate-1 | Start in the equilibration dialog box. Check the equilibration result in the dialog box and confirm the window of equilibration changes color to gray.",
    "Save the equilibration settings by clicking Save Eq. File in the equilibration dialog box. Enter the equilibration file name and click Save in the Save As dialog box.\nNext, perform calibration by selecting Tools | Calibration. Click the Add and enter the load value (134.33 N) in the Applied Force box.\nClick the Start button in the dialog box. Check the calibration result in the calibration dialog box and confirm that the calibration was done correctly; the value of Newton is shown as 134.33 and the value of loaded Cells matches with that of the sensor sheets being used if the calibration was done correctly.\nAfter that, save the calibration setting by clicking Save Cal. File. Enter the calibration file name and click Save in the Save As dialog box. After the equilibration and calibration, turn off the air valve on the controller and extract the sensor sheet from the compressor.\n2. Measurement\nPreparation\n\t\nConnect each device and start up the software according to steps 1.1. and 1.2. Make sure that two real-time pressure distribution maps for each sensor sheet are displayed when the sensor sheets are connected via the cable at the same time.\n\t\tNOTE: In this experiment, two sensor sheets are needed to measure the thumb and index finger, respectively. It is necessary to perform equilibration and calibration for each of them according to the procedures described in section 1.4.",
    "Recall the equilibration and calibration files created in steps 1.4.2. and 1.4.5. With the real-time pressure distribution map active, select Tools | Load Equilibration File. Select the equilibration file and click Open. Then, select Tools | Load Calibration File. Select the calibration file and click Open. Make sure that the real-time pressure distribution map is displayed in Newtons after loading calibration file. Perform the above for each of the two maps.\nAttach the pressure-sensitive parts of the two sensor sheets to both sides of the iron cube using double-sided tape. To prevent the sensor sheets from being damaged, cut 3−5 mm lengths of tape and place them on the four corners on the outside of the iron cube. Make sure that the surface of the sensor sheet is on the outside.\nPlace the iron cube on top of a setting stand on a table before the measurement.\nAfter arranging the measurement environment, fix the recording settings for the movie frames, period, and frequency. Select the Options | Acquisition Parameter command. In the data acquisition parameter dialog box, enter 36000 in the movie frames, 0.01 in the Period, and 100 in the frequency. Click OK and close the dialog box.\nStarting the measurement\n\tNOTE: Figure 1 demonstrates a grip and lift task.\n\t\nHave the participant sit in front of a table and adjust the table height (participant’s shoulder joint flexion 0° and elbow joint flexion 90° position). Set the iron cube and setting stand 30 cm from the participant in the midsagittal plane on the table. Wipe the participant’s finger pulps with an alcohol swab or towelette.",
    "Give the participant verbal instructions as follows: “Use minimal force with your thumb and index finger to grasp both sides of the iron cube to which the sensor sheets are attached. After that, lift it approximately 5 cm above the setting stand, hold it for 5−7 s, and then place it back on the setting stand.”\nIf the participant is ready, give them a cue to start the task and start a recording by clicking Record on the toolbar. Click Center Of Force Trajectory to monitor the COP while recording. When the task is over, click Stop on the toolbar. After the recording, save the movie data by selecting File | Save Movie as. Enter the movie file name and click Save in the dialog box.\n\t\tNOTE: The weight of the iron cube, number of lifts, and the interval between tasks should be considered according to the purpose of the experiment and task difficulty.\nChange the measurement conditions according to the purpose of the experiment. For example, to investigate the effect of dual task interference in a grip and lift task, adjust the measurement conditions as follows depending on the type of interference.\n\t\nFor postural interference, have the participant stand in front of a table and adjust the table height. Give the participant verbal instructions as follows: “Stand on one leg, and use minimal force with your thumb and index finger to lift the iron cube approximately 5 cm above the setting stand. Hold it for 5−7 s and then place it back on the setting stand.”",
    "For visual interference, have the participant sit in front of a table and adjust the table height. Give the participant verbal instructions as follows: “Close your eyes. Use minimal force with your thumb and index finger with to lift the iron cube approximately 5 cm above the setting stand. Hold it for 5−7 s and place it back on the setting stand.” Allow participants to touch the sensors without exceeding 0.5 N before closing their eyes.\nFor cognitive interference, have the participant sit in front of a table and adjust the table height. Give the participant verbal instructions as follows: “As a calculation task, continuously subtract 7 from 100 as accurately as possible. While performing the calculation, use minimal force with your thumb and index finger to lift the iron cube approximately 5 cm above the setting stand. Hold it for 5−7 s and place it back on the setting stand.”\nFor contralateral hand movement interference (Figure 2), have the participant sit in front of a table and adjust the table height. Place the peg board 30 cm from the participant in the midsagittal plane next to the iron cube and consider the size and number of pegs to adjust the task difficulty. Give the participant verbal instructions as follows: “Manipulate the iron cube with minimal force using your thumb and index finger. Lift and hold the iron cube approximately 5 cm above the setting stand with one hand, and invert the peg using the other hand. Repeat using the opposite hand.”\n3. Data analysis\nAnalysis of grip force\n\t\nStart the software on the computer. Click File | Open Movie, select the movie file for analysis and Open.",
    "As the recorded pressure distribution map appears, click Multiple Window View on the map and refer the graph 1 window. Find the point in time which the load (grip force) starts to be applied in each lift, and note the time with reference to this graph.\nAfter that, save the grip force data in ASCII format. Select File | Save ASCII after making the graph 1 window activated. In the object-graph 1 dialog box, select Panes with the file name and click Save ASCII. In the dialog box, select Save Force, Pressure, and Area values. Specify Force in the Y-axis box, Time in the X-axis box, and Absolute in the Y-mode. Click OK in the property dialog box. Enter the ASCII file name and click Save in the dialog box.\nIf information on the contact areas between finger pulps and sensor sheets is needed, specify Contact Area in the Y-axis box and click OK. Enter the ASCII file name and click Save in the dialog box.\nNext, open the movie file. Confirm that the file is opened in spreadsheet format and Frames, Time, Absolute time, Raw Sum and Force are noted. With reference to the time noted in step 3.1.2., find a cell which the load starts to be applied; the load values starts to increase and exceed 0.5N in the force row.\nCalculate the total grip force used in a range, which is the sum of the values from the cell was applied in the force line.\nAnalysis of center of pressure\n\t\nStart the software. Click File | Open Movie, select the movie file for analysis and click Open.",
    "With the pressure distribution map active, click Play Forward to play the movie. Make sure that the COP trajectory appears on the pressure distribution map. Find the frame which the COP starts to appear in each lift with Next Frame or Previous Frame, which are the commands to move forward or backward the frames. Then, note that frame number.\nAfter that, save the COP data in ASCII format. Select File | Save ASCII with the distribution map active. Specify Center of Force in the data type dialog box and Whole movie in the movie range dialog box. Click OK in the property dialog box. Enter the ASCII file name and click Save in the dialog box.\nNext, open the movie file. Confirm that the file opens in spreadsheet format and COMMENTS Frame, Time, Absolute time, Row, Col and Raw Sum are noted. With reference to the frame noted in steps 3.2.2., find a cell (1) which the COP starts to appear.\nCalculate the COP trajectory length between frames. Select a cell (2) after the row including the frame which the COP starts to appear. Insert the following calculation formula: (=SQRT((Row cell (2) -Row cell (1))^2+(Col cell (2) -Col cell (1))^2). The sum of the COP trajectory length between frames in a range is the total COP trajectory within that range.",
    "NOTE: In the graph 1 window, the vertical line shows the load value (N), and the horizontal line shows the time (s). This load value corresponds to the grip force. Data saved in ASCII format can be used in applications such as spreadsheets and text editors. In this experiment, the participants were instructed to hold the cube for 5−7 s in the task, so the grip force and COP trajectory were calculated and recorded for 4 s from their first appearance. In the spread sheet of the COP data, the position of the COP on X- and Y-axis coordinates is shown as a value.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
