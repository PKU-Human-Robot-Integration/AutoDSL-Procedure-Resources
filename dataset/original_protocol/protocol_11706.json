  "procedures": [
    "All animal procedures outlined here have been reviewed and approved by the Animal Care Institute of The Ethics Committee of Soochow University.\n1. Fish husbandry and embryo collection 14\nFeed fish three times every day; ensure the zebrafish are maintained at 28.5 ± 0.5 °C with a 14:10 h light/dark cycle.\nSeparate the male and female adult fish by isolation boards in spawning tanks at a 2:1 male to female ratio in the evening.\nThe next morning, remove the isolation boards at 9:00 AM and collect the embryos 2 h later.\nPlace the embryos in a biochemical incubator maintained at 28.5 °C before the experiment.\n2. Chemical exposure\nPrepare the mother stock: weigh lead acetate trihydrate (5 g), and dissolve it in ultrapure water (50 mL) with stirring.\n\tCAUTION: PbAc is toxic. Wear suitable dust masks, protective clothing, and gloves. Perform the experiment under a fume hood.\nSelect and randomly distribute zebrafish embryos into clean 6-well plates (30 embryos per well in 3 mL of zebrafish breeding water; see Table 1 for its composition). Treat the embryos with PbAc (0, 5, 10, 20 mg/L) from 2 to 120 h post fertilization (hpf).\n\tNOTE: The concentrations of PbAc were chosen according to the dose-range-finding experiments. The results showed that the LC50 of lead acetate on zebrafish embryos was 41.044 mg/L at 120 hpf. Hence, the highest concentration was set to half of the LC50 and a series of solutions prepared by 2-fold dilution.\nFeed the larvae twice a day from 5 days post fertilization (dpf). Maintain the zebrafish embryos at 28.5 ± 0.5 °C with a 14:10 h light/dark cycle.\nRefresh the Pb-free medium (zebrafish breeding water) every 24 h until 9 dpf.",
    "​NOTE: Upon completion of the experiments, all lead-containing solutions were poured into a designated liquid tank and treated by the experiment management center.\n3. Alizarin red staining\nNOTE: Wear suitable dust masks, protective clothing, and gloves during the entire staining process. The compositions of all solutions are shown in Table 1.\nSpecific staining steps\n\tNOTE: The dyeing process was carried out in a 24-well plate at room temperature. After each solution was added, place the 24-well plate on the shaking table set at a low speed.\n\t\nRemove 10 zebrafish larvae randomly from each group at 9 dpf and fix the fish in 1 mL of 2% paraformaldehyde/1x phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h.\nDecant the solution and wash the zebrafish larvae with 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)/10 mM MgCl2 for 10 min.\nDecant the solution and incubate the larvae in the following solutions for 5 min each for destaining: anhydrous ethanol (EtOH) solution (80% EtOH/100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)/10 mM MgCl2, 50% EtOH/100 mM Tris-HCl (pH=7.5), and 25% EtOH/100mM Tris-HCl (pH=7.5).\nDecant the solution, remove the pigment by bleaching with a solution consisting of 3% H2O2 and 0.5% KOH, and observe once every 10 min until the pigment is completely removed.\nRinse the zebrafish larvae several times with 25% glycerin/0.1% KOH for 10 min each until there are no bubbles.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important to avoid bubbles; otherwise, the bubbles in the zebrafish body will appear as a black field of view under the microscope, which will affect observations and quantitative analysis.\nStain the larvae by soaking in 1 mL of 0.01% alizarin for 50 min.\nDecant the solution and add 1mL of 50% glycerin/0.1% KOH for 10 min to clear the background. Store the fishes in fresh 50% glycerin/0.1% KOH for subsequent observation.\n4. Image acquisition",
    "Transfer one larva onto the glass slide each time, keeping the larva in the middle of the liquid drop.\nObserve the larvae under a stereo microscope.\nTurn on the camera, open the software (see the Table of Materials), and keep the default settings.\nClick on AE, and choose an appropriate exposure time (60 ms in this experiment) to obtain the best image.\nCapture all the images under the same settings. Save the images in .tif format for later analysis.\n5. Image analysis\nNOTE: See the Supplemental file for an example with a set of sample graphs for image analysis.\nDouble-click the ImageJ icon and analyze the images saved in step 4.5.\n\t\nClick on File | Open to open the images saved in step 4.5.\nClick on Image | Type, select 8-bit.\nClick on Edit | Invert.\nClick on Analyze | Calibrate, select Uncalibrated OD in the popup interface, check Global calibration at the bottom left of the lower interface, and click OK.\nClick on Analyze | Set Scale | Click to Remove scale in the popup interface, check Global below, and click OK.\nClick on Analyze | Set Measurements, select the item area in the popup interface, check the Limit to threshold below (to measure only the selected range), and click OK.\nClick on Image | Adjust| Threshold, slide the slider in the middle of the popup interface to select the appropriate threshold (change the threshold for each image) so that all targets to be tested in one image are selected, and click Set.\nClick on Analyze | Measure. Record the dates of each group.\nUse one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test to analyze the differences, and set the significance level at p < 0.001 (***).\nSubscription Required.
