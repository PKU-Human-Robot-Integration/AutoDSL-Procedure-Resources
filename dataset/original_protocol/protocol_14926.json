    "Appropriate national and local institutional ethics should be in place before performing animal experiments. Specifically in the United Kingdom the following experiments were undertaken under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Where two microsurgeons are available to operate simultaneously the donor surgeon should perform steps 1.1 to 1.16 then 3.1 to 3.5, whilst the recipient surgeon performs 2.1 to 2.8. For a single operator the steps can be followed sequentially.\n1. Donor Preparation\nNote: The procedure presented here is for a donor C57BL/6BM12 and recipient C57BL/6 male mice aged between 8 to 16 weeks old with a body weight greater than 20 g. However this procedure can be reproducibly performed on a variety of mouse strains. The data presented in the representative results section was obtained from C57BL/6, C57BL/6BM12 and BALB/c mice.\nConduct procedures using sterile surgical instruments and consumables (autoclaved), with endeavors to keep the operating area as sterile as possible. Perform the donor preparation simultaneously with the recipient preparation if two surgeons are available.\nAnesthetize the mouse with an intraperitoneal injection (31G needle) of medetomidine (0.5 mg/kg) and ketamine hydrochloride (200 mg/kg). This results in an anesthetic plane that is maintained for 4 hr providing enough time for the whole procedure to be performed. Supplemental anesthesia is not necessary.\nConfirm that the mouse is anaesthetized (no response to toe pinch).\nShave the mouse’s abdomen and remove any loose hair with sticky tape.\nPlace the mouse on its back on a sterilely draped heated mat and loosely immobilize the limbs with sterile masking tape.\nMonitor the mouse throughout the procedure for thermal burns. If possible use a non-electric heat source.\nApply an eye lubricant and sanitize the abdominal wall with a dilute iodine solution.",
    "Make a midline incision in the abdomen to enter the peritoneal cavity and insert a 3 cm Calibri abdominal retractor.\nApply warmed saline to keep the intestines and surgical area moist and avoid unnecessary drying of the viscera.\nCover the mouse with sterile drapes and move the intestines to the operator’s left (mouse’s right) to expose the aorta, vena cava and left kidney.\nApply a ratcheted forcep to the stomach and pull superiorly to expose the major vessels and left kidney fully. Pack damp sterile swabs (2 mm x 2 mm) into the abdomen to retract tissues away from the surgical area, such as the liver lobes, seminal vesicles, and bowel.\nIsolate the left kidney from surrounding adventia, fat and the left adrenal gland in the peritoneal cavity by bluntly dissecting the connective tissue using fine tip forceps. Place the closed tips of the forceps between the areas that need to be separated and slowly allow the forcep tips to open to dissect the space.\nIsolate the left renal vein by ligating and then dividing the left adrenal vein and left gonadal vein with 9/O nylon. Place the suture close to the renal vein.\nLigate and divide the ureter with 7/O silk suture close to the bladder leaving the suture ends long. These long suture ends will be used when the kidney is harvested and are necessary for the ureteric anastomosis.\nTo mobilize and fully dissect the aorta and vena cava superiorly and inferior to the renal artery and vein use fine tip forceps to bluntly dissect lymphatic vessels and fat from the front and sides of the vessels.\nFind the tissue plane between the aorta and vena cava and slowly spread the forceps. Slowly open the tips of the fine tipped forceps to spread the tissue with minimal trauma.",
    "Tie a loose 7/O silk around the aorta superior and inferior to the renal artery by passing an angled fine tip forceps around the back of the vessels and drawing a suture through. These sutures will be tightened prior to kidney retrieval to allow retrograde perfusion of University of Wisconsin solution.\n2. Recipient Preparation\nAs per the donor preparation follow steps 1.2 to 1.8.\nMove the intestines to the operator’s right (mouse’s left) to expose the aorta, vena cava. Cover the intestines with a sterile saline soaked swab.\nPerform a right nephrectomy by ligating the right renal artery and vein together with 7/0 silk suture and then divide.\nLigate the right ureter with 7/O silk suture and divide.\nMobilize and fully dissect the aorta and vena cava inferior to the renal artery and vein as described in step 1.14 and 1.15. Ensure complete dissection between the aorta and vena cava. Take care to preserve the internal spermatic artery which runs anterior to the vena cava and aorta along with the lymphatic bundle.\nIdentify lumbar vessels running in the retroperitoneum from the vena cava and vein to the spine, ligate with 9/O silk in continuity, there is no need to divide the vessels.\nIdentify sufficient space to place microvascular clamps with space between for vascular anastomoses.\nAdminister intravenous heparin (5 units) via dorsal penile vein.\n3. Donor Kidney Retrieval\nTighten the 7/O silk ties that have been placed around the inferior and superior aorta to isolate the kidney from the arterial circulation.\nInfuse retrograde cold 0.2 – 0.5 ml of University of Wisconsin solution with a needle (31G) into the aorta.",
    "Divide the aorta within the sutures and divide the renal vein at its junction with the vena cava to remove the kidney and the renal artery with a length of aorta. Divide lumbar vessels arising from the aorta, if they are present, without ligation.\nPlace the kidney in cold saline on a sterile swab in a culture dish.\nEuthanize the donor mouse by cervical dislocation.\n4. Kidney Transplantation – Kidney Preparation\nCreate an aortic patch by dividing the aorta wall longitudinally directly opposite the renal artery. Identify any vessel lumens in the patch that need to be ligated or avoided when performing the arterial anastomosis.\nPlace a 10/O suture from outside to inside the renal vein lumen superiorly and a second separate suture inferiorly. The sutures used to divide the adrenal vein and gonadal vein can be used to orientate the vessel.\nPlace the kidney in the right flank of the recipient (Figure 1.1) and ensure the sutures are well placed to ensure vascular anastomoses can be completed without the sutures becoming entwined in swabs or other instruments.\n5. Kidney Transplantation – Vascular Anastomosis\nApply microvascular clamps first inferiorly then superiorly encompassing the vena cava and aorta.\nMake a ventomy with a needle (31G) by puncturing the anterior wall of the vena cava. Flush blood from the vena cava by injecting approximately 50 μl of 0.9% NaCl.\nWiden the venotomy using fine tip forceps by opening them within the venotomy so that the length is equivalent to the diameter of the donor renal vein.\nPlace the 10/O superior suture (which is already in the lumen of the renal vein) first at the apex of the venotomy (Figure 1.2) and join the back wall of the anastomosis in a running suture until the inferior apex is reached (Figure 1.3).",
    "Place the 10/O inferior suture and tie first with a single knot (Figure 1.4) then tie to the running suture from the back wall.\nUsing the inferior suture create the front wall of the anastomosis (Figure 1.5) with a running suture and tie to the superior suture end at the superior apex (Figure 1.6).\nCreate an aortotomy by picking up the aorta wall with forceps and cutting an elliptical patch with scissors (approximately the aortotomy should be a fifth of the circumference of the aorta and three times the renal artery lumen in length).\nPlace a 10/O suture at the superior point of the aortic patch from outside to inside (Figure 1.7) and pass through the aorta to tie outside the vessels at the superior apex of the aortotomy.\nCreate the arterial anastomosis with a running suture starting superiorly (Figure 1.8) anastomosing the donor patch to the recipient aorta, take care not to constrict the anastomosis by tying the suture too tight (Figure 1.9).\nRemove the inferior vascular clamps first then the superior clamp to reperfuse the kidney (Figure 1.10 and 1.11). Visible peristalsis of the ureter maybe seen if adequate blood supply to the ureter is achieved.\n6. Kidney Transplantation – Ureteric Anastomosis\nDivide any attachments of the bladder from the abdominal wall.\nPass a needle (21G) from the left to right of the bladder through both walls.\nPlace straight forcep tips in the needle lumen and pass both back through the bladder such that the forceps are now passing from right to left out of the left side of the bladder.\nDraw the suture on the donor ureter through the bladder such that the ureter passes in the left bladder defect then out of the right side.",
    "Suture the adventitia of the ureter to the adventitia of the bladder with three single interrupted sutures around the entry point with 9/O nylon suture on a round-bodied needle.\nCut the ureter proximal to the ligature, thus opening the ureter to allow urine to flow and allow the ureter end to retract into the body of the bladder. Visible production of urine may be observed along with bleeding from peri-ureteric vessels.\nClose the right side bladder defect with a single interrupted 9/O silk suture.\n7. Recovery and Post-operative Care\nReplace the gastrointestinal viscera into the abdomen in their original orientation and close the abdominal wall by approximating the rectus muscles with 6/O absorbable suture.\nApproximate the skin with metal skin clips.\nPartially reverse the anesthesia with a subcutaneous injection of atipamazole hydrochloride (10 μl/g).\nAdminister analgesia by subcutaneous buprenorphine hydrochloride (0.05 mg/kg) and for fluid support injection 1 ml of subcutaneous 0.9% NaCl.\nRecover the mouse in a warming cabinet at 28 °C for 24 to 48 hr. Observe the mouse for illness up to the completion of the experiment.\nRemove metal skin clips 7 – 10 days post operatively.\nOnce the experiment is complete euthanize the mouse by cervical dislocation.\nRemove and collect the contralateral kidney and allograft for histological analysis.\nSubscription Required.
