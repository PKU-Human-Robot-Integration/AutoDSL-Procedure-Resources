The protocol includes 3 main parts:\n    \nPart 1: Coating plates (1 day).\nPart 2: Plating the cells (1 day).\nPart 3: Culture maintenance (> 47 days).\nCoating plates\nDay -1: Coat plates with poly-L-ornithine and laminin\nTiming: 1 day\n      Before plating hiPSCs, the plate needs to be coated with poly-L-ornithine\n      and laminin-521. The following section describes how to prepare the\n      coating for culturing E/I co-cultures. Based on the research question or\n      downstream analysis, certain types of cell culture formats can be\n      chosen. hiPSCs can be plated in 24-well plates with coverslips. Coverslips\n      are pretreated with nitric acid and autoclaved) for immunocytochemistry or\n      single-cell patch clamp recording. Additionally, hiPSCs can be cultured in\n      multi-electrode array (MEA) plates for measuring the neuronal network\n      activity. The volumes of reagents described here are tailored to a 24-well\n      plate and MEA plate.\n    \n        Dilute poly-L-ornithine in filtered borate buffer (50 mM) to a final\n        concentration of 50 μg/mL.\n        \n            Add poly-L-ornithine dilution in the corresponding volumes as\n            presented in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] depending on the culturing\n            format.\n            table:files/protocols_protocol_2449_10.csv\nNote: The coverslips need to be pretreated\n      in nitric acid at least overnight before being extensively washed by\n      Milli-Q water for 20 times. For the washing step, the Milli-Q water should\n      immerse the coverslip in a beaker. Gently shake the beaker each time for\n      at least 1 min. Take the coverslips out of the water by using a tweezer,\n      and distribute the coverslips evenly in a petri dish without overlapping\n      before autoclaving. Coverslips are then ready to use.\n    \nNote: The pore size of the",

The\n      following section describes how to plate rtTA/Ngn2- and\n      rtTA/Ascl1-positive hiPSC lines for direct conversion to\n      neurons. All following volumes are corresponding to culturing conditions\n      of hiPSCs in a 6-well plate.\n    \nNote: When changing the E/I plating ratios\n      to 85:15, 80:20 or 60:40, the number of glutamatergic neurons present in\n      the culture should be kept at a similar density whereas the number of\n      GABAergic neurons is altered. This allows to make sure that the baseline\n      electrophysiological activity remains consistent.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] We\n      determined these ratios by combining the defined number of glutamatergic\n      and GABAergic neurons for the plating at DIV0. However, during culturing a\n      certain number of neurons do not survive or do not converse, the\n      proportion of which is typically slightly higher for GABAergic neurons. To\n      this end for each plating ratio at DIV0, we provide also the real E/I",
