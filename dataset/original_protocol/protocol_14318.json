  "procedures": [
    "All experimental procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Catholic University of Korea and were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publications No. 80-23).\n1. SE Induction\nPurchase 8-week-old male C57BL/6NHsd mice and weigh each mouse. Then, use a marker pen to mark the tails of all mice for their easy identification during SE induction.\nCalculate the amount of scopolamine methyl bromide (scopolamine; 2 mg/kg), terbutaline hemisulfate (terbutaline; 2 mg/kg), and pilocarpine hydrochloride (pilocarpine; 280 mg/kg) based on the mouse weight and add saline (0.9% NaCl, 10 mL/kg) to make solutions.\nNote: For example, if the weight of the mouse is 25 g, the following amounts are applied: Scopolamine and terbutaline: 2 mg/kg * (25 g/1,000 g) = 0.05 mg, Saline: 10 mL/kg * (25 g/1,000 g) = 0.25 mL, Pilocarpine: 280 mg/kg * (25 g/1,000 g) = 7 mg, Saline: 10 mL/kg * (25 g/1,000 g) = 0.25 mL.\nLoad the scopolamine and terbutaline mixture in a 1 mL syringe with a 30 G needle. Inject the solution intraperitoneally into each mouse, and then return the mice to their cages. At 30 min after scopolamine and terbutaline administration, inject pilocarpine solution into each mouse (i.p.; 1 mL syringe; 30 G needle). Immediately after pilocarpine injection, place the mice in an incubator (28-30°C) for observation.",
    "Carefully monitor the behavior of the mice until SE is induced. If limbic motor seizures that correspond to stage 3 or higher according to Racine's scale are detected, record the time and monitor the mice to determine whether the seizures occur more frequently. Once continuous motor seizures last more than 2 min, place the mouse in a new cage at room temperature and keep monitoring for 3 h to determine whether their convulsive seizures continue and SE is induced. Euthanize the mice that failed to enter SE at about 2 h after pilocarpine injection.\nNote: Racine's scale; stage 1, mouth and facial movement; stage 2, head nodding; stage 3, forelimb clonus; stage 4, rearing with forelimb clonus; stage 5, rearing and falling with forelimb clonus16. If the mouse is not transferred to the cage at room temperature immediately after SE induction, the mouse can die due to hyperthermia.\nTerminate behavioral acute seizures at 3 h after SE onset by injecting diazepam solution (i.p.; 10 mg/kg; 1 mL syringe; 30 G needle). Make the diazepam solution by diluting 5 mg/mL of diazepam in 10% polyoxyl 35 hydrogenated castor oil by adding saline (i.p.; 10 mL/kg; 1 mL syringe; 30 G needle). \nNote: 10% polyoxyl 35 hydrogenated castor oil solution: 1 mL polyoxyl 35 hydrogenated castor oil solution + 9 mL saline. Store the solution at room temperature. For example, if the mouse body weight is 25 g, inject 250 µL of diazepam solution: 50 µL 5 mg/mL diazepam + 200 µL 10% polyoxyl 35 hydrogenated castor oil solution = 250 µL 1 mg/mL diazepam.",
    "For sham mice, perform an i.p. injection of the scopolamine methyl bromide and terbutaline hemisulfate mixture (i.p.; both 2 mg/kg, 10 mL/kg; 1 mL syringe; 30 G needle). 30 min later, inject the saline intraperitoneally (i.p.; 10 mL/kg; 1 mL syringe; 30 G needle).\nNote: If the mouse body weight is 25 g, inject 250 µL of saline instead of pilocarpine.\nAfter diazepam injection (i.p.; 1 mL syringe; 30 G needle), administer 1 mL of 5% dextrose per individual mouse (i.p.; 1 mL syringe; 26 G needle).\nNote: 1 mL of 5% dextrose injection provides energy source and hydration that can increase the survival rate.\nDuring post-care in the incubator (28-30 °C), wipe off excessive secretions such as saliva, tears, and feces.\nAt day 1 after SE induction, weigh the mice and keep them in the incubator (28-30 °C) for one extra day. At day 2, after SE induction, weigh the mice and return them to their home cage. Provide moist chow to facilitate their recovery.\nNote: In this experiment, the mortality rate for C57BL/6NHsd after SE termination was 8.57% on average (3 out of 35 mice tested).\nMeasure daily body weight of the animals until 7 days post-pilocarpine and inject the mice with 5% dextrose(i.p.; 1 mL syringe; 26 G needle) when the body weight has not increased. Stop body weight monitoring when the mice start to regain body weight and consume moist chow without difficulty at 2 days after pilocarpine injection.",
    "Note: If the body weight of a mouse did not increase until 7 days post SE, exclude the mouse from the experiment and euthanize by carbon dioxide. Depending on the background of the mouse, death can occasionally occur; however, in the case of C57BL/6NHsd, less than 1% of mice died in these experiments. With survival of more than 7 days after SE induction, the mice rarely die during the latent period.\n2. Implantation Surgery for Video-EEG Monitoring\nPrepare 12-week-old mice (4 weeks after SE induction) to perform telemetry implantation for EEG monitoring.\nNote: Timing of implantation can be modified depending on the experimental purposes and the mouse strains.\nBefore surgery, anesthetize the mouse with a mixture (4:0.5) of ketamine (50 mg/mL) and xylazine (23.3 mg/mL) solution dissolved in saline at a dose of 2.5 µL/g body weight (i.p.; 1 mL syringe; 26 G needle). Monitor respiratory rate and respiratory effort of the mouse at regular intervals (15 min interval maximum) and assess the depth of anesthesia by the pedal withdrawal reflex.\nPlace the mouse in a stereotaxic frame with ear bars and a bite plate and apply vet ointment on both eyes to avoid blindness.\nTo maintain sterile conditions during the surgery, shave surgical sites using a razor blade. Be careful to prevent fur contamination of the surgical field. After shaving, disinfect the skin with 70% ethanol and iodine solution.\nNote: Surgery should be performed in an aseptic manner wearing sterile gloves and masks, using sterilized equipment and aseptic techniques.",
    "After confirming the depth of anesthesia, make a midline incision of the skin to expose the skull. Make two burr holes with a drill attached to the stereotaxic apparatus at the coordinates from the Bregma in the anteroposterior axis (AP): +0.1 mm, mediolateral axis (ML): +0.1 mm (Reference), and AP: −0.2 mm, ML: +0.22 mm (Left parietal cortex)13.\n\t\nWipe the skin with PBS-soaked cotton swaps, followed by 70% ethanol and iodine solution. Make a longitudinal incision in the middle of the head with scissors to expose the Lambda (the point where the sagittal and the lambdoid suture meet), the Bregma (the point of intersection of the coronal suture by the sagittal suture), and the target location.\nIdentify anatomical landmarks such as Lambda and Bregma. Position the drill bit at Bregma and note the X, Y coordinates for this point.\nUse a brain atlas books or published references to determine the appropriate coordinates of the brain regions for EEG recording. Then, calculate the coordinates for the screws (reference and recording) using the Bregma coordinates measured at step 2.5.2.\nSlowly lower the drill bit to make a burr hole being careful to avoid inserting the drill bit too far at the point where the skull becomes thinner.\nInsert the body of the single channel wireless EEG transmitter behind the nape of the neck subcutaneously and place flexible leads near the skull.\nPlace a stainless-steel screw (2 mm length) into each burr hole with tweezers and tighten it using a screw driver by clockwise rotation. Make sure the screw is not inserted too far deep by adjusting the degree of screw rotation in order to prevent damage to the dura or the brain tissues.",
    "Strip the insulation coat 2 mm from the tip of the leads and stretch the wire long enough to round the screw shaft for a good connection between the wire and the screw. Connect the reference lead to the front screw and the recording lead to the screw in the parietal cortex. Then, apply dental cement to secure the entire assembly in place without exposing the metal parts.\nAfter verifying that the dental cement has completely dried by visual inspection, suture the skin and apply topical mupirocin ointment. Place the mouse in a 30 °C incubator alone until it recovers from the surgery (about 30 min). Then, return the mouse to the home cage until continuous video-EEG monitoring begins.\nNote: After surgery, each mouse is injected (i.p.; 1 mL syringe; 30 G needle) with 5 mg/kg of gentamicin (antibiotics) and 5 mg/kg of ketoprofen (analgesics). Animals should be monitored until they become fully ambulant. Transmitter-implanted mice have a recovery period of approximately 1 week.\n3. Video and EEG Monitoring and Analysis\nPlace a mouse in an individual cage and place the cage on top of the wireless receiver plates where the Faraday cage is installed to avoid interruption of electrical signals from any sources including a computer, AC lines, and adjacent receivers.\nNote: Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer. Care must be taken to avoid blind spots.\nRecord the electrical activity using the wireless video-EEG telemetry system.\n\t\nOpen the software for video-EEG recording. Click \"Hardware\" and select \"Edit configuration\". Match the receiver and the transmitter implanted into each mouse. Click \"Channel configuration\" and confirm all the channels are active. Click \"Video configuration\" to synchronize the video with the EEG data (resolution of 40 x 480 and frame rate of 30.00).",
    "Note: Install an IP camera with high sensitivity if it is critical to collect good image qualities that can identify subtle behavioral changes of the mice at night.\nClick \"Setup\" and \"P3 setup\" to input individual animal information, matched camera, and graph setting.\nClick \"Acquisition\" and \"A/D sampling rate\" to setup sampling rates. Click \"Data set name\" to designate each experiment.\nNote: Sampling rate for EEG needs to be higher than 500 Hz. Due to the large video and EEG data size, it is recommended that only 24 h of data are handled per session rather than using a continuous 2-week-recording as one file. Data can be separately saved at 8 h or 12 h intervals in case of RAM memory shortage.\nActivate the transmitter with a magnetic bar and click \"Start acquisition\" to collect the video-EEG recording. Continuously monitor the mouse by video-EEG system for at least 2 weeks.\nNote: For C57BL/6 mice, SRS tends to occur in clusters that last about 5.2 days and the duration of the seizure-free period is about 6.7 days17.\nDetermine the seizure frequency and duration by manual inspection using the analysis software.\n\t\nMark the area showing SRS and export the data for statistical analysis. Be cautious to exclude EEG artifacts that can be generated by scratching the head or chewing; these can be removed by checking the video data.\nNote: SRS is defined as a sudden onset of repetitive epileptiform spiking activity (≥ 3 Hz) that persists for more than 10 s. Convulsive behaviors can be frequently accompanied with a burst of spiking activity. Non-convulsive seizures can also demonstrate electrographic spiking activities without convulsive behaviors. Seizure termination is defined as occurring when the firing spikes return to baseline activity.",
    "For analysis of seizure frequency, divide the total number of SRS cases detected during the 2 weeks by the total number of recording days for each individual animal.\nFor analysis of seizure duration, measure the time from the onset to the end of the epileptiform spiking activities.\nAfter completion of the video-EEG recording, fix the brain with 4% paraformaldehyde by transcardial perfusion. To anesthetize the mouse, inject a solution (4:0.5) of ketamine (50 mg/mL) and xylazine (23.3 mg/mL) dissolved in saline at a dose of 10 μL/g body weight (i.p.; 1 mL syringe; 26 G needle). Once the mouse is confirmed to be deeply anesthetized, perform transcardial perfusion.\nBefore isolating the mouse brain, retrieve the transmitter from the mouse for reuse after cleansing.\n\t\nRemove the dental cement around the leads using forceps.\nSoak the tip of the leads with dental cement in 100% acetone until the dental cement is dissolved.\nRemove tissue contaminants around the transmitter by rinsing it with distilled water.\nRinse the transmitter with 70% ethanol for 3 h and air dry it for storage. Immediately prior to the next use, rinse the screw and transmitter with 70% ethanol, followed by distilled water, and place them in saline.\nNote: Care must be taken to avoid cutting the flexible wires when decapitating the mouse since, if the flexible leads are too short, the noise in the next implantation and video-EEG recording may increase.\nSubscription Required.
