    "1. VACNFs production (Figure 2 and Figure 3)\nSpincoat a silicon wafer with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) 495 A4 resist at 4000 rpm and bake it at 180 °C for 5 min.\n\tNOTE: Let the wafer cool for 10 s before proceeding to the next step.\nSpincoat a second layer of resist (PMMA 950 A2) and bake it at 180 °C for 5 min.\nUse electron beam lithography to define the catalyst dots with diameters of 300 nm at a specified lateral spacing (pitch: 10 µm, or 35 µm) in 3 mm x 3 mm arrays.\nDevelop the resist in 30-40 mL of 1:3 methyl-isobutyl ketone: isopropyl alcohol (IPA) for 1.5 min, followed by rinsing it with IPA and drying it with N2.\n\tNOTE: Check for the array of dots using a brightfield microscope (20x objective).\nClean the wafer of the residual resist with a 6 s exposure in oxygen plasma (descum) in a silicon etcher.\nUse electron beam evaporation to deposit first an adhesive layer of metal (Ti or Cr, 10 nm) and then deposit a second layer, which is the Ni catalyst (130 nm or 150 nm). During Ti or Ni metal deposition, keep the current below 0.2 A at 10 kV, the pressure below 5 x 10-6 Torr, and the deposition rate at ~1 A/s for line-of-sight deposition.\nUse sequential bath sonication to remove the metal (Ni) deposited on the underlying resist layer, leaving the Ni deposited directly on the silicon wafer. This process is called lift-off.\n\t\nFor this, prepare 3 containers with acetone and bath sonicate the wafer in acetone for 1 min; repeat 3 times at room temperature (RT, 20 °C) at a frequency of 35 kHz. Rinse with IPA and dry with N2.",
    "NOTE: Never let acetone dry on the wafer. After the last acetone sonication, immediately rinse with IPA and then dry with N2 gas. If at any point the wafer becomes prematurely dry (prior to IPA rinse) there is the possibility that not all the excess metal and resist will be removed and the acetone can leave a residue.\nCheck the geometry of catalyst shape using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). To capture SEM images of the VACNF chips, tilt the stage to a 30° angle and use a voltage of 1-3 kV, with a beam current of ~100 pA, and a ~5 mm working distance.\n\tNOTE: The catalyst should look like a hockey puck (a compact cylinder) (Figure 4). The height of the compact cylinder should reflect the thickness of Ni deposited on the silicon wafer. If the profile of the Ni dot is tall and appears to be concave at the top, resembling a volcano (Figure 4), then the catalyst is more likely to dewet into multiple Ni droplets resulting in branching of the carbon nanofibers9(Figure 4 and Figure 5). Such problems can result from resist melting during metal evaporation because of long deposition times or issues with the lift-off procedure (Figure 4 and Figure 5).\nQuarter the silicon wafer and place it in the direct current plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition chamber (dc-PECVD) with the acetylene/ammonia mixture. Optimize the growth parameters to control the length and taper of nanofibers (tips <200 nm).\n\t\nUse a current of 1-1.5 A and a voltage range of 440-560 V. When growing the fibers, use a pre-treatment phase with ammonia flow while the machine and substrate heat up to 620 °C. Ensure to turn on the carbon source (acetylene) 10 s before starting the plasma.",
    "NOTE: Quarter wafers are used in case the PECVD machine run parameters need to be optimized. To produce fibers with lengths greater than 40 µm and tips less than 200 nm in diameter, the following parameters are suggested: with a Ni catalyst thickness of 130 nm, use a current of 1.75 A, growth time of 70 min, and an acetylene : ammonia ratio of 45 standard cubic centimeter per minute (sccm) : 100 sccm. With a Ni thickness of 150 nm, use a current of 1.5 A, a growth time of 80 min, and an acetylene : ammonia ratio of 48 sccm : 100 sccm. Use the following parameters to grow VACNFs regardless of catalyst thickness: growth temperature of 620 °C, pressure of 10 torr during plasma, and a shower head height of 20 mm (Figure 6).\nAssess the geometry of the resulting fibers using SEM at a 30° tilt with an acceleration potential of 1 kV.\n\tNOTE: Optimal fibers will be straight and non-branching. It is impossible to control the crystal orientation of the Ni catalyst with the electron beam evaporator. As a result, there will be some fibers that branch because of catalyst dewetting9. Also, the crystal orientation causes the VACNFs to grow to different heights, so uniform heights on all VACNFs are difficult.\nSpincoat a layer of photoresist (SPR955) onto the fibers at 1000 rpm for 45 s. Then dice the ¼ wafer into 3 mm x 3 mm arrays using a dicing saw. Store the fibers at this point for later use.\n\t​NOTE: Do not conduct step 1.11 if planning to transfer fibers to a flexible substrate.\n2. Transferring VACNFs to a flexible substrate (Figure 7 and Figure 8)",
    "After the fibers are synthesized, spincoat SU-8 2015 photoresist onto the wafers or quarter wafers at 4000 rpm for 45 s.\nSoftbake the wafer for 3 min at 95 °C.\nUsing a contact aligner, expose the wafer with a 3 mm 3 mm array patterned mask that aligns with the defined pattern from electron beam lithography at 95 mJ/cm2.\n\tNOTE: Use a proximity contact mode with an exposure gap that is at 20 µm greater than the tallest fiber. There is the possibility that fibers could be knocked over during this step in the process.\nPerform a post-exposure bake for 6 min at 95 °C.\nDevelop the wafer in SU-8 developer for 15 s, rinse it with IPA, and dry the wafer with N2, moving from top to bottom.\n\t​NOTE: When developing the wafer, ensure it is completely submerged.\nSpincoat patterned wafers with a protective layer of thin photoresist (SPR 955 CM 0.7) at 3000 rpm for 45 s and softbake for 30 s at 90 °C.\nDeposit a thin silicon oxide layer to the wafer (2-3 nm) by placing it in an atomic layer deposition for 22 cycles at 100 °C.\nUse a dicing saw to cut the wafer into 3 mm x 3 mm squares. Align the dicing saw to the preexisting pattern on the wafer.\nAssess the geometry of the resulting fibers using SEM at a 30° tilt with an acceleration potential of 3 kV.\nStop here if storing chips for long-term use (>1 week). Store chips in the dark.\nTo separate flexible substrates from rigid substrates, place individual chips in acetone for 30 min or until the SU-8 starts to curl.",
    "Wash SU-8 films (either attached to or detached from rigid substrates) with IPA for 5 min and then with water for 5 min. Place the chips in a commercial box with a sticky pad when transporting them.\nOPTIONAL: Place the fiberless side of the SU-8 film on water-soluble tape or on top of thin silicone rubber with a thin polyethylene terephthalate (PET) (12.5 µm thick) backing.\n\t\nUse a pair of tweezers to transfer the SU-8 film. Press on the edges of the SU-8 square to help it stick to the tape/silicone rubber-PET; this is to avoid breaking off fibers. At this point, the VACNF films are ready for immediate use.\nTo prepare a silicone rubber/PET holder, do the following: using a 2-part kit for silicone rubber, mix the two parts together (the elastomer and the crosslinker). Next, cut out a square of PET and tape it down in a clear plastic dish. Pour a very thin layer of silicone rubber on top of the PET and cure it at 80 °C for 1-2 h.\n3. On-plant method (where a drop of solution to deliver is placed on a plant surface) using fibers in a rigid substrate (Figure 1A)\nRemove the photoresist with increment washes of acetone (100%, 5 min), IPA (100%, 5 min), and ddH2O (5 min) prior to use.\nPlace the plant tissue to be impaled on a hard surface for support.\nPlace a 1 µL droplet of dye or DNA (200 ng) onto the surface of the plant tissue.\nPlace a VACNF chip with a rigid substrate on the top of the droplet, with the fibers oriented such that they will come into contact with the droplet.",
    "NOTE: The orientation of the chips can be determined by the \"shininess\" of the wafer. The shiny side of the chip has fibers, and the opaque side does not.\nUsing the flat side of a pair of tweezers, tap the chip. Mark the area of the plant that the chip came into contact with using a soft-tipped marker. Remove the VACNF chips after delivery.\n\tNOTE: The amount of force applied when tapping will vary depending on the type of plant tissue used. It is recommended to practice tapping chips prior to conducting the impalement of fibers. Avoid damage to plant tissues. Damage is apparent when one can see the outline of the VACNF chip in the plant tissue.\nRepeat steps 3.1-3.5 for controls (+Dye/DNA, -Fibers; -Dye/DNA, +Fibers; and -Dye/DNA, -Fibers). -Fibers is the fiberless side of a chip.\nStore intact plants or excised plant organs in humid chambers in long-day conditions (16 h light, 8 h dark) if needed. For excised organs, use a plastic Petri dish with wet paper towels.\n4. On-chip method (where a drop of solution to deliver is placed on a VACNF chip), rigid substrate (Figure 1B)\nRemove the photoresist with increment washes of acetone (100%, 5 min), IPA (100%, 5 min), and ddH2O (5 min) prior to use.\nDrop cast 1 µL droplet of dye or plasmid DNA (200 ng) onto the fiber side of VACNF chip with rigid substrate. Ensure to place the droplet in the center of the chip and cover several fibers. Let the droplet dry for 15 min.\n\tNOTE: The orientation of the chips can be determined by the \"shininess\" of the wafer. The shiny side of the chip has fibers, and the opaque side does not.",
    "When working with leaves or other excised organs, place them on top of a hard surface. When working with intact plants, place a hard surface beneath the organ to which VACNFs are applied.\nAfter the 15 min drying step, position the VACNF chip such that the fiber side comes in contact with the plant tissue. Tap the chip with the back end of a pair of tweezers.\n\tNOTE: The amount of force applied when tapping will vary depending on the type of plant tissue used. It is recommended to practice tapping chips.\nRepeat steps 3.6-3.7 of the on-plant method.\n5. Applying VACNFs in SU-8 films to plant tissue using the on-chip method (Figure 1C)\nPlace 1 µL droplet of dye or DNA (200 ng) onto the fiber side of the SU-8 film and let it dry for 10 min. Be sure to place the droplet in the center of the chip.\n\tNOTE: There are different drying times depending upon the substrate used.\nUsing a pair of sharp tweezers, place the VACNF film onto the plant surface.\n\tNOTE: The longer the SU-8 films are left out in the air, the more brittle the films become. To limit the risk of losing the SU-8 films, ensure to have all plants/samples and equipment near the SU-8 films.\nGently roll a small makeup applicator over the VACNF film. Mark the areas where the flexible substrates are placed with a soft-tipped marker. Remove the flexible substrates from the plant surface using tape.\n\tNOTE: The amount of force applied when rolling the makeup applicator will vary among the plant tissues used. Practice applying the VACNF films prior to conducting biomolecule or dye delivery. Visible damage to plant tissues is apparent when one can see the outlines of VACNF film in the plant tissue.",
    "Repeat steps 5.1-5.3 for controls and store plants as mentioned in step 3.7 of the on-plant method.\n6. Microscopy and image analysis for all delivery methods\nImage the samples using a confocal microscope using emission and excitation wavelengths suitable for the delivered fluorescent probe/reporter.\n\tNOTE: The time required for the transient transformation varies with the plant species and the marker delivered. For example, the expression of fluorescent markers was detected after 48 h in Arabidopsis versus 96 h in lettuce leaves7.\nWhen imaging, try to focus on a region with detached fibers. Fibers will have different orientations. The success of delivery is not dependent on appearance of broken-off fibers.\n\tNOTE: Fibers will be fluorescent with the most common excitation/emission settings due to the formation of silicon nitride layer resulting from the fiber formation in PECVD18.\nCapture at least 5 images for each sample. The resulting signal will vary.\nMeasure the fluorescence values as total fluorescence (integrated density) in 20 µm x 20 µm confocal image areas7 using ImageJ19."
