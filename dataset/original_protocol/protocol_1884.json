    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSoftening and arrangement of silkworm eggs\nTiming: 4–5 h\nIn this step, the embryos will be prepared for injection, including softening of the eggshells and arranging the eggs onto a glass slide.\nSeparate female and male moths after mating for four hours. Place female moths on a clean paper and lay eggs in dark. The oviposition time was recorded.\nCritical: If there are large number of silkmoths, you can put the mating female silkworms in a refrigerator at 4°C, and take them out when they are needed to lay eggs. They can be stored at 4°C for up to one week.\nCollect eggs every 30 min, soak the paper with silkworm eggs in 20% NaOCl solution for 5–10 min to soften egg shells.\nCritical: NaOCl solution is easy to decompose when it is exposed to light, therefore, the softening process should be carried out in dark.\nTake out the eggs soaked in 20% NaOCl solution and rinse them in clean water for several times.\nCarefully absorb the water stain on the surface of the silkworm eggs with absorbent paper, and then use tweezers to gently place the silkworm eggs neatly on a glass slide coated with glue (Kuosen chemical technology, Hangzhou, China).\nEggs (100–120) are arranged in 8–10 rows and 10–12 columns on each slide (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1477-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Schematic of silkworm egg softening and arrangement\nCritical: Arrange the \"D\"-like silkworm eggs in the direction from the raised side to the right to make the needle on the right easy to enter the egg.\nMicroinjection\nTiming: 15–20 min\nIn this step, embryos are injected at different developmental stages or with different injection methods (dsRNA for single gene or mixed dsRNA for two genes).",
    "After the paste on the slide is dried, place the slide on the stage of the optical microscope (SZX2, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).\nPull capillary glass needle using pn-31 needle puller (NARISHIGE, Tokyo, Japan) under the conditions of parameter: Heater (98°C), Magnet sub (25) and Magnet main (65).\nDraw 4–6 μL of the prepared dsRNA (5 μg/μL) solution ( RNase-free water) with a capillary glass needle.\nSet up two groups of RNAi experiments. In one group, to detect the effect of injected dsRNAs on the RNAi efficiency, load dsRNA of one gene and a dsRNA mixture of two genes (dsDnmt1 and dsMBD2/3) into the capillary glass needle with sealed pointed end, respectively, using a microloader (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and inject the egg at fertilized egg stage. dsGFP is used as a control for injection (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1477-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Model diagram of different injection methods of silkworm embryos\n(A) dsRNA of one gene or multiple genes is injected at fertilized stage.\n(B) dsRNA of Dnmt1 or MBD2/3 is injected at different stages of embryo development.\nIn the other group, to detect the RNAi effect in different development stages, separately inject dsDnmt1 or dsMBD2/3 into embryos at different developmental stages (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nCritical: Avoid bubbles in the capillary glass needle when adding dsRNA.\nAssemble the dsRNA-filled capillary glass needle into a needle holder, and install a tungsten needle in another needle holder.\nAfter assembly, adjust the angle of the two needles and break the capillary end of the capillary glass needle using a tweezer (Anex, Niigata, Japan) under the microscope (SZX2, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).\nAdjust and record the positions of the two needles to ensure that the capillary glass needle can enter the silkworm eggs and inject them from the holes made by the tungsten needles.",
    "Inject each silkworm egg with 30–50 ng dsRNA under the conditions of injection parameter: injection pressure (120), compensation pressure (50) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1477-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Schematic of silkworm fertilized egg microinjection\nEgg sealing and sterilization\nTiming: 10–15 min\nIn this step, the injected embryos are sealed and sterilized to prevent death.\nAfter microinjection, seal the injection hole with quick-drying glue (Kuosen chemical technology, Hangzhou, China) under the microscope to avoid embryonic death caused by loss of egg contents.\nCritical: The quick-drying glue only is needed to seal the injection hole, do not add too much to prevent the larvae from breaking the egg shell and dying.\nPut the cotton soaked in 10% formaldehyde into a glass bottle, and put the sealed silkworm eggs into this bottle for sterilization with 10% formaldehyde steam for 5 min.\nAfter sterilization, put the eggs in a sealed box, and move the insect box into an artificial climate chamber at 25°C under a photoperiod of 12 h light:12 h darkness.\nCritical: A little sterilized water can be added to the sealed box to ensure the humidity environment required for embryonic development.\nOn the fifth or sixth day of silkworm embryonic development, the formation of the silkworm embryo in the egg shell can be observed through an optical microscope.\nRNAi efficiency test\nTiming: 5 days\nIn this step, the RNAi efficiency of embryos at different developmental stages and different injection methods was detected by RT-qPCR.\nGroup one：inject dsRNAs of one and two genes into a fertilized egg (within three hours of fertilization), then collect samples (15–20 eggs per sample) at different time (24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h) after injection (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]), and detect RNAi efficiency by RT-qPCR.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1477-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Model diagram of RNAi efficiency test at different times after fertilized eggs injected",
    "dsRNAs were injected into fertilized eggs (within three hours of fertilization) and RNAi efficiency was tested at 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h after injection.\nGroup two: inject dsRNAs into the B. mori embryos at different developmental stages (fertilized egg, blastoderm, germband, organogenesis, reversal period and youth period), then collect samples at 24 h after injection (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]), detect RNAi efficiency by RT-qPCR.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1477-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Model diagram of RNAi efficiency test of embryos dsRNA-injected at different developmental stages\ndsRNAs were injected into the embryos at fertilized egg, blastoderm, germband, organogenesis, reversal period and youth period stage, respectively. RNAi efficiency was determined by RT-qPCR at 24 h after injection.\nThe RNAi efficiency is based on three biological replicates each comprising three technical replicates.\nRNA extraction and reverse transcription\nPut 15–20 silkworm eggs into an EP tube, add 1 mL RNAex Pro Reagent (Accurate Biotechnology, Changsha, China), grind with a homogenizer on ice, and place the ground material on ice for 5 min.\nAdd 200 μL of chloroform: isoamyl alcohol = 24:1 (V/V), vigorously shake for 15 s, place on ice for 10 min.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 g for 4°C, 15 min, move the upper water phase to a new EP tube, add an equal volume of isopropanol, gently invert to mix, and place at –20°C for 0.5–1 h.\nCollect RNA by centrifuge at 12,000 g for 4°C, 10 min. Discard the supernatant, add 1 mL of 75% ethanol to the pellet, briefly vortex and centrifuge at 12,000 g for 10 min to wash the RNA pellet. Repeat two more times.",
    "After drying, use 20 μL Nuclease-Free Water to dissolve RNA. Add 1 μL DNase I and 2.3 μL 10× DNase I buffer, incubate at 37°C for 30 min to remove DNA. Detect RNA purity and concentration with NANODROP 2000 spectrophotometer.\nPrepare the RNA template solution according to the following table, and denature RNA at 65°C for 5 min.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1477_6.csv\nPrepare the reverse transcription reaction system according to the following table, and incubate the reaction at 42°C for 30–60 min.
