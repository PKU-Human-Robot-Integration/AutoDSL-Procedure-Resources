    "Molecular cloning of type III antitoxin RNA Perform the DNA synthesis and cloning of the identified type III TA operon into a high copy number E. coli plasmid vector through a gene synthesis service provider. Sub-clone the antitoxin repeats and its natural promoter into pRSFDuet-1 vector using standard cloning protocols described below (Figure 1A and Supplementary Table 1).Design forward and reverse primers to amplify the antitoxin region along with the natural promoter and terminator, with addition of restriction enzyme sites NcoI and XhoI at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the insert. PCR amplify the insert from the plasmid containing type III TA operon, using Phusion DNA polymerase (a PCR reaction setup is indicated in Recipe 1 and Table 1).Table 1.

    "Purify the PCR-amplified insert using the PCR purification kit following the manufacturer’s protocol and elute DNA using nuclease-free water.Digest ~1–2 μg of the PCR purified insert using the restriction enzymes NcoI and XhoI by incubating at 37 °C for 2 h by setting up a reaction as described in Recipe 2.Digest ~5 μg of the pRSFDuet-1 vector using the same restriction enzymes in a 50 μL reaction. After digesting the vector, incubate the reaction mixture at 80 °C for 20 min to heat-inactivate the restriction enzymes. Treat the mixture with 0.3 μL of calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) at 37 °C for 1 h to prevent vector self-ligation.Purify the digested insert and vector using 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Visualize the digested insert and vector bands from the ethidium bromide–stained gel by UV irradiation at 254 nm. Excise the gel bands containing the vector and insert and isolate the respective DNA fragments using a gel extraction kit following manufacturer’s protocol; elute DNAs using nuclease-free water.Use 100 ng of each digested vector and insert DNAs (~1:7 ratio) to set up a 20 μL ligation reaction as described in Recipe 3. Incubate the reaction mixture at room temperature for 1 h followed by incubation at 4 °C for 5–12 h.Transform 10 μL of the ligation reaction mixture in E. coli DH5α competent cells and plate them in LB agar plate containing kanamycin (0.05 mg/mL) antibiotic. A control ligation reaction and transformation could be performed without the insert DNA in the reaction mixture. The control reaction should result in significantly fewer (~10-fold) colonies than the ligation with the insert.Isolate plasmid DNA from the colonies obtained upon transformation using a plasmid isolation kit and confirm the positive clones by sequencing.",
    "Molecular cloning of type III toxin protein Design forward and reverse primers to clone the type III toxin into an E. coli expression vector under an inducible promoter with a hexahistidine tag. The vector must be compatible for co-transformation with the pRSFDuet-1 vector with a different antibiotic resistance and a different origin of replication (e.g., pCold II, pRSFDuet-1, pET21a(+), etc.) In our study, we cloned the type III toxin into a pCold II vector under a cold-shock inducible promoter with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag between the restriction enzyme sites NdeI and XbaI.Obtain the ligated plasmid containing toxin insert in the vector of interest by following cloning steps A2–A7 of antitoxin cloning using the toxin insert and appropriate vector DNA.Co-transform 10 μL of the ligation mixture along with 100 ng of the antitoxin DNA containing plasmid in E. coli DH5α competent cells and plate on an LB agar plate containing both kanamycin (0.05 mg/mL) and ampicillin (0.1 mg/mL) antibiotics.Isolate the plasmid DNA mixture (toxin and antitoxin) from the colonies obtained and confirm the positive toxin clones by sequencing using primers specific to the toxin cloning site. The obtained plasmid DNA mixture will be used further to transform E. coli cells to express and purify the type III TA complex. In our study, the plasmid DNA mixture contains antitoxin and toxin cloned in vectors, as shown in Supplementary Table 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4763/bioprotoc-13-13-4763-g001.jpgFigure 1. A general strategy for cloning type III toxins in expression vectors. (A) Schematic of cloning of antitoxin ToxI RNA in an expression vector. The antitoxin DNA was cloned along with its natural constitutive promoter in pRSFDuet-1 vector. (B) Schematic of cloning of toxin ToxN protein in an expression vector. The toxin DNA was cloned with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag in an IPTG inducible vector such as pCold II.",
    "(C) No colonies were obtained upon transformation of plasmids containing only toxin. (D) Positive colonies were obtained upon co-transforming plasmids containing toxin and antitoxin in different compatible vectors.Transformation and inoculation Place a vial of E. coli BL21 DE3 competent cells from -80 °C stock on ice to thaw for 15 min.Add ~100 ng of the plasmid mixture (toxin and antitoxin) and incubate on ice for 20 min.Provide heat shock by placing the vial in a dry bath at 42 °C for 45 s and immediately transfer the vial on ice and incubate for 5 min.Add 250 μL of LB medium to the vial in a laminar airflow cabinet and incubate for 1 h in a shaker incubator maintained at 37 °C at 180 rpm.Spread plate by using 150 μL of this culture on an agar plate containing double antibiotic [corresponding to the plasmid combination chosen; here, we used ampicillin (0.1 mg/mL) and kanamycin (0.05 mg/mL)] and incubate for 12–14 h to obtain the transformed colonies. We did not observe bacterial colonies post-transformation of only toxin plasmid (Figure 1C). However, the co-transformation of toxin and antitoxin plasmids resulted in bacterial colonies selected using dual antibiotics (Figure 1D).Inoculate 100 mL of LB medium with both antibiotics with a single colony from the transformed plate. Incubate overnight at 37 °C at 180 rpm in a shaker incubator.Depending on the plasmid in which the toxin and antitoxin are cloned (Table 1), one of the following steps can be followed:Toxin cloned in pCold II: inoculate 10 mL of the overnight primary culture (in LB media) into a larger secondary culture (1 L of LB media) and incubate until OD600 reaches ~0.8–1.0. Incubate the culture at 15 °C without shaking for 30 min and induce by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM.",
    "Incubate at 180 rpm for 24 h at 15 °C for complex expression. Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 6,800× g for 15 min.Toxin cloned in pET-21a(+): inoculate 10 mL of the overnight primary culture (in LB media) into a larger secondary culture (1 L of LB media) and incubate until an OD600 ~0.6–0.8. Induce by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM. Incubate the culture at 180 rpm for 4–5 h at 37 °C for complex expression. Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 6,800× g for 15 min.Stop point:  The cell pellet can be stored at -20 °C for up to a month before processing.Cell lysis and Ni-NTA affinity chromatography Resuspend the cells in lysis buffer (see Recipes) and add a tablet of protease inhibitor cocktail.Lyse the cells by sonication with a pulse of 3 s on and 6 s off and an amplitude of 32%.Centrifuge the lysed cells at 18,328× g for 45 min at 4 °C in the Oakridge centrifuge tubes.Equilibrate Ni2+-NTA column connected to a peristaltic pump with lysis buffer. Filter the supernatant using a 0.45 μm syringe filter and load it onto the column at a 1.5 mL/min flow rate. After loading, wash the column with 50 mL of wash buffer (see Recipes). Elute the complex using elution buffer.Collect three fractions: E1, the first 2 mL; E2, the next 15 mL; and E3, the final 5 mL. Store at 4 °C.Wash the column with the final wash buffer to remove any bound protein to the column. Pass 25 mL of Milli-Q water and store the Ni2+-NTA column in 20% ethanol.PAGE analysis of toxin and antitoxin: to analyse the flowthrough, wash, and elution fractions on 12% SDS-PAGE for the presence of toxin protein and on 15% Urea-PAGE for the presence of RNA antitoxin.",
    "Visualize the protein in SDS-PAGE gels with Coomassie brilliant blue staining solution followed by destaining using destaining solution (see Recipes). The RNA can be visualized by staining the urea-PAGE gels with 0.25% toluidine blue solution followed by destaining using water.Dialysis Collect all the elution fractions that contain the TA components for dialysis (usually, E2 has the TA components).Dialysis: wash an appropriate length (which can hold the elution fraction volume containing the TA component) of the 6 M dialysis bag with a cutoff of 3.5 kDa with MilliQ H2O and equilibrate with dialysis buffer.Carefully add the elution fractions into the bag and dialyse at 4 °C for 4–5 h.Change the dialysis buffer and continue to dialyse for 12–14 h.Ion-exchange chromatography Equilibrate the anion-exchange column with 25 mL of ion-exchange buffer A.Filter the dialysed complex using a 0.45 μm syringe filter and load it onto the anion-exchange column at a 1 mL/min flow rate connected to ÄKTA prime plus FPLC system. After loading, wash the column with 20 mL of ion-exchange buffer A.Elute the complex by increasing the gradient of NaCl from 50 to 1,000 mM (using buffer A and buffer B), over a volume of 100 mL. This should yield separate fractions of ToxN protein (~0%–20% buffer B), TA RNP complex (~45%–55% buffer B), and antitoxin ToxI RNA repeat (~55%–75% buffer B) (Figure 2A), which can be confirmed by PAGE analysis of protein and RNA components.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4763/bioprotoc-13-13-4763-g002.jpgFigure 2.

(F) Urea-PAGE analysis of SEC-purified ToxINEc-C1 complex. Gel stained using toluidine blue dye for RNA shows the presence of ToxIEc-C1 RNA repeat.Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) After ion-exchange chromatography, collect the fractions containing toxin, antitoxin, and complex separately.Pool each set of fractions separately and concentrate using Amicon® Ultra-15 centrifugal filter (3.5 kDa) to a final volume of ~4 mL.Filter the concentrated samples using a 0.45 μm syringe filter and inject into Sephacryl S-200 or Superdex S200 columns, pre-equilibrated with SEC buffer. Figure 2B–2D show the SEC elution profiles of antitoxin RNA (Figure 2B), TA RNP complex (Figure 2C), and toxin protein (Figure 2D).Analyse the fractions on SDS-PAGE and urea-PAGE. Figure 2E and 2F show the SDS-PAGE and urea-PAGE analysis of SEC-purified ToxINEc-C1 complex for the presence of toxin protein and antitoxin RNA, respectively.The fractions can be pooled together and concentrated appropriately depending on the experiment that needs to be performed, such as NMR spectroscopy, crystallization, or ITC. Using this protocol, we could also successfully purify two other ToxIN complexes and their components (from cluster 4 and 5 of E. coli) (Manikandan et al., 2022) (Supplementary Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 2)."
