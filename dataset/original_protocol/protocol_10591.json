    "The human molars were extracted following the standard procedures for extraction at the Ostrow School of Dentistry of the University of Southern California and handled with the approval of the Institutional Review Board.\n1. Preparation of Acid-etched Tooth Slice\nSelect a human third molar without any restored caries.\nRemove the root portion of the molar, and cut the crown of the molar longitudinally into slices 2 mm thick using a water-cooled low-speed diamond saw. Ultrasonically clean these slices for 2 min, and then rinse them with deionized water 3 times.\nTo simulate erosive lesions, etch the tooth slices with 30% phosphoric acid for 30 sec then immediately rinse them with deionized water.\nUltrasonically clean the etched slices for 2 min, and then rinse them with deionized water 3 times.\n2. Preparation of Amelogenin-chitosan Hydrogel\nPreparation of chitosan stock solution\n\t\nDissolve 1% (w/v) chitosan (medium molecular weight, 75-85% deacetylated) in a 1% (v/v) acetic acid solution followed by stirring at 80 °C O/N.\nAfter cooling the solution to RT, filter the chitosan solution using a 0.45 μm filter. Adjust the pH value to 5.0 by adding 1 M NaOH solution.\nPreparation of calcium and phosphate stock solution (0.1 M)\n\t\nWeigh out calcium chloride (CaCl2) and prepare a 0.1 M solution, then mix using a vortex until the solution is clear. Adjust the pH value to 11 by adding 1 M NaOH solution.\nWeigh out dibasic sodium phosphate (Na2HPO4) and prepare a 0.1 M solution, then mix using a vortex until the solution is clear.\nExpression and purification of recombinant amelogenin17-18\n\tThe recombinant full-length porcine amelogenin (rP172) used here has 172 amino acids and is an analog of full-length native porcine P173, but lacking the N-terminal methionine as well as a phosphate group on Ser16 18.",
    "Add 20 g of Lysogeny broth (LB) Agar powder into 500 ml deionized water, autoclave the solution at 121 °C (liquid setting) for 20 min. Let agar cool to ~ 55 °C, add ampicillin (100 μg/ml) into agar solution.\nTransfer the agar solution to Petri dishes, let each plate cool until it is solid, then flip to avoid condensation on the agar. Store plates in plastic bags at 4 °C.\nStreak the LB agar plate with recombinant cells (E.coli–BC21) from the glycerol stock (-80 °C). Incubate the plates O/N at 37 °C.\nPrepare 50 ml of NZCYM media and autoclave the media at 121 °C for 30 min. Allow the media to cool down, add 50 µl of 100 µg/ml ampicillin to the 50 ml media.\nInoculate a single colony from the LB agar plate into the 50ml NZCYM media supplemented with ampicillin. Incubate the cells O/N in a shaking incubator at 37 °C.\nPrepare 1 L of NZCYM media and autoclave the media at 121 °C for 30 min. Add 1 ml of 100 mg/ml ampicillin to 1,000 ml media. Take an optical density (OD) reading as a blank using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. NOTE: Do not discard this after first reading.\nInoculate 10 ml of the cell culture from step 2.3.5 into 1,000 ml media from step 2.3.6. Read the optical density at 595 nm immediately after inoculation. Take the optical density reading periodically to keep track of the growth. NOTE: Read the blank each time the OD is taken.\nInduce with 700 µl of Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, 1 M) when the bacterial growth reaches to about 0.75~0.8 OD at 595 nm.",
    "Harvest the cells when the OD reaches 1.1. Pour the contents of the flask into 6 plastic bottles. Balance and weigh the bottles before using the centrifuge. Centrifuge for 20 min at 8,554 x g at 4 °C. Keep the cell pellet in the -20 °C O/N.\nTake out the cell pellets and combine them in a 50 ml tube. Add 3.5 ml of 4M Guanidine HCl per L of fermentation. Sonicate 2-3 times on ice, 30 sec each time, with 1 min intervals.\nMake 6x dilutions of cell volume with 0.5% formic acid and let it stir in the cold room for 2 hr. Centrifuge for 30 min, 8,554 x g at 4 °C. Keep the supernatant. Add 20% Saturated ammonium sulfate using the saturated stock solution and stir in the cold room, O/N.\nCentrifuge for 30 min, 8,554 x g at 4 °C and keep the pellet. Reconstitute the pellets in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), load onto a C4 column (10 x 250 mm, 5 µm), and fractionate using a linear gradient of A=0.1% TFA and B=60% acetonitrile in TFA, at a flow rate of 1.5 ml·min-1.\nFreeze the protein solution on dry ice and lyophilize the frozen sample O/N.\nPreparation of amelogenin-chitosan (CS-AMEL) hydrogel (Figure 1A)\n\t\nAdd 200 µg of rp172 into a tube containing 960 µl of 1% chitosan solution, then mix using a vortex until the solution is clear.\nAdd 25 µl of 0.1 M CaCl2 solution followed by 15 µl of 0.1 M Na2HPO4 solution to the amelogenin-containing chitosan solution, then mix using a vortex for 5 min.\nAdjust the pH of the CS-AMEL solution to 6.5 by carefully adding 1 M NaOH solution. CS-AMEL hydrogel will form when the pH value reaches 6.5.\n3. Enamel Regrowth in Amelogenin-chitosan Hydrogel",
    "Preparation of artificial saliva solution\n\t\nDissolve a certain amount of magnesium chloride (MgCl2, 0.2 mM), calcium chloride (CaCl2, 1 mM), potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4, 4 mM), potassium chloride (KCl, 16 mM) and ammonium chloride (NH4Cl, 4.5 mM) in 20 mM HEPES (4-(2-Hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethane-sulfonic acid) buffer12.\nAdjust pH to 7.0 with 1 M NaOH and store the artificial saliva solution at 4 °C.\nBefore using the solution, add sodium fluoride (NaF, 300 ppm).\nApplication of CS-AMEL hydrogel\n\t\nApply about 20 µl CS-AMEL hydrogel to the etched tooth slice using a syringe (Figure 1B).\nDry the hydrogel-covered tooth slice in a desiccator at RT for 2 hr.\nTransfer the tooth slice to a beaker containing 30 ml of artificial saliva solution. Cover the beaker with aluminum foil, and then keep the beaker in an oven at 37 °C for 7 days.\nRemove the tooth slice and dry it in a desiccator at RT.\n4. Characterization of Interface between Newly Grown Layer and Enamel\nThe microstructure of the interface between the newly grown layer and enamel was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high revolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). The TEM sample was prepared using a focused ion beam (FIB) technique, the steps for which are as follows.\nLoad the sample into a FIB-SEM instrument and finish all the alignments according to the operating instructions. NOTE: Fine Z adjustment should be performed at least 2 times.\nDeposit a carbon layer (15 × 3 µm) on the sample to protect the underlying structure (Figure 2A).\nMill the sample carefully at the upper, lower and right sides of carbon layer to prepare a thin piece of sample, and then cut the bottom side of this thin piece. NOTE: Check the Ion beam alignment before each milling step (Figure 2B).",
    "Weld a Pt tip on the thin piece and cut the left side to separate the sample piece (Figure 3C). NOTE: Check the Ion beam alignment before the welding step.\nLift out the Pt tip with the sample slowly, and mount the lamellar sample onto a lift-out TEM grid.\nDetach the tip from the sample, and thin the sample until its thickness is less than 100 nm (Figure 3D). Remove the sample from the instrument to perform the TEM observation. NOTE: Check the Ion beam alignment before each thinning process.\n5. Assessment of Binding and Mechanical Properties of Newly Grown Layer\nThe binding strength is assessed by ultrasonic treatment. Keep the repaired tooth slice in an ultrasonic cleaner (42 kHz, 100 W) for 10 min, and then observe the interface between the repaired layer and natural enamel with a backscattered-electron SEM analysis.\nMeasure the hardness and elastic modulus at 20 test points on each repaired enamel surface (n=3) by a nano-indenter with a Berkovich tip.\n6. Immunofluorescence Staining\nWash the tooth slice with Tris buffer saline (TBS) for 15 min.\nBlock with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBS for 15 min.\nRemove the liquid and incubate the sample O/N with 1°Ab (1:500 Chicken Anti-Amelogenin) diluted in TBS (0.1% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100).\nWash the sample with TBS for 30 min and incubate O/N with 2°Ab (1:100 Anti-chicken FITC) diluted in TBS.\nWash the sample with TBS for 30 min and leave to dry for another 30 min.\nObserve by fluorescence microscope.\nSubscription Required.
