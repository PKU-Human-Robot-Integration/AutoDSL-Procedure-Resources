    "If many sgRNAs have been generated, it is preferable to narrow down potential guides using a relatively inexpensive and less laborious method such as an in vitro cleavage assay prior to directly targeting hPSCs.\nAfter introduction into the pX459 plasmid (Fig. 3C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-fig-0003]), it is necessary to verify that the sgRNA can cleave genomic DNA in vitro before proceeding into live cells. To do this, in vitro transcription (IVT) and cleavage (IVC) assays are used. To perform IVT, primers are used to amplify the full-length sgRNA. One of the primers contains the T7 promoter sequence, which is used to perform in vitro transcription in the next step (Fig. 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-fig-0004]). Meanwhile, a PCR amplicon covering the sgRNA target locus is generated (Fig. 4C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-fig-0004]). The transcribed sgRNA and the genomic PCR amplicon are mixed together in the presence of a recombinant Cas9 protein, and the cleavage reaction is analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis alongside a PCR amplicon control (Fig. 4D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-fig-0004]). In comparison to the single, uncleaved DNA band of the control, the IVC reaction product should reveal two distinct, shorter bands. To facilitate this, the PCR amplicon should be designed so that the cut site is asymmetrically located and products are of sufficient size for the cleaved products to be readily detected on a gel. Where possible, genomic DNA from the hPSC line used for downstream targeting should be used as a test of efficiency and to empirically determine if any polymorphisms may need to be considered.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8a37bf1c-5fb7-433b-b049-4cec94520ed3/cpz1232-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4",
    "In vitro transcription and cleavage assays. (A) Examples of the primers that must be ordered for T7 amplification: 5′ T7 sequence–sgRNA for the forward primer, while the reverse primer is a universal primer for the pX459 plasmid. The T7 PCR reaction will then amplify out a region of DNA of approximately 100 bp in length, which can be verified on a gel. (B) Process of in vitro transcription. The T7 amplicon is transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase to generate large quantities of the sgRNA. (C) Process of the in vitro cleavage assay. A 300-600 bp amplicon is generated that contains the sgRNA target site. The target site is staggered towards one side of the amplicon to ensure that separate bands can be visualized on a gel. The amplicon is mixed with recombinant Cas9 protein and the sgRNA. (D) Result of the in vitro cleavage assay. Assuming the sgRNA is efficacious, the amplicon should be cleaved by Cas9 protein and the resulting fragments can be separated on by agarose gel electrophoresis.\nMaterials\nQ5 Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs, cat. no.

Thaw the frozen MEGAshortscript T7 kit reagents on ice, except for the 10× T7 reaction buffer, which should be thawed at room temperature.\n6. Prepare the following IVT reaction in RNase-free tubes.

To use, make up an extra tube and in place of the 8 μl of T7 guide DNA, add 2 μl of 18s rRNA sequence with 6 μl NF water.\n7. Gently flick tubes to mix, pulse spin to bring liquid to bottoms of tubes, and incubate at 37°C for 3 hr.",
    "8. Add 1 μl of TURBO DNase (from kit) and incubate at 37°C for a further 15 min.\n         \nThis step is optional but recommended to eliminate residual DNA\n9.

Design PCR primers to amplify a product roughly 200-500 bp in length, with the expected CRISPR-Cas9 cut sites site located off-center (e.g., 300/sgRNA site/200 for a 500-bp amplicon).\nThe in vitro cleavage assay will enable the recombinant Cas9 protein to cut the PCR amplicon within the seed sequence of the sgRNA, resulting in two products of given sizes that can be separated by agarose gel electrophoresis; therefore, having cleaved products of different sizes allows for better visualization of the assay",
    "13. Identify the optimal conditions for PCR amplification by performing reactions across an annealing temperature gradient. It may be necessary to adjust other parameters, such as the nature of the DNA polymerase, concentration of MgCl2, or chemistry of the buffers used. Once a clean amplicon is produced, sequence the amplicon to ensure that the PCR primers are specific and amplifying the gene of interest.\nWhile we use the NEB Q5 High-Fidelity PCR kit mentioned below, any optimized PCR kit can be used.\n14.

    "20. Heat inactivate the reaction by incubating at 65°C for 5 min.\n21. Analyze the results on a 2% TAE agarose gel at 100 V for 60 min (see Current Protocols article: Voytas, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-bib-0083]), running a sample of uncut amplicon beside each IVC reaction mixture, to demonstrate the cutting ability of each sgRNA.",
    "Following the in vitro test of cleavage efficiency, the next step is to perform nucleofection of hPSCs with the most promising sgRNA(s) (Fig. 5A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-fig-0005]). Testing in hPSCs allows for the analysis of indel efficiency and mutagenic spectrum via subsequent MiSeq analysis. This step is helpful for further refining sgRNA selection, as the nature of indels generated and their relative frequency is specific to each sgRNA. Overall, for a null mutant, it is preferable to select a guide that consistently generates a high proportion of indel mutations that lead to frameshift mutations.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ba3ff410-ce9f-485c-9aef-827b3f4b8872/cpz1232-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5",
    "Generating CRISPR-Cas9 targeted hPSCs. (A) Schematic of the nucleofection plan. hPSCs of healthy morphology are harvested, counted, and then nucleofected with the concentrated pX459 harboring the appropriate sgRNA. 2 million cells are plated across 3 wells of a 6-well plate pre-coated with MEFs 24 hr earlier. Cells are grown in medium supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 for 30 hr before undergoing puromycin selection at a concentration determined empirically. After 48 hr of puromycin selection, cells are cultured in puromycin-free medium. After a set number of days, cells are collected for MiSeq. For genes unlikely to affect pluripotency or self-renewal, we recommend collection from 5-10 days after puromycin selection finishes. For genes likely to affect pluripotency or self-renewal, we recommend collection from 2-6 days after puromycin selection finishes. (B) Schematic of the process of single cell cloning targeted hPSCs. Instead of collecting for MiSeq, cells can undergo cloning. Twelve colonies are collected and immersed in 12 wells of a 96-well plate loaded with Accutase. Cells are disaggregated to single cells, then transferred to 12 wells of a 12-well plate to ensure single cells are spatially separated. This process can then be repeated after colonies grow to a sufficient size, in order to ensure that colonies are produced from single clones. (C) Representative images of hPSC morphology during the nucleofection. hPSCs before nucleofection should form compact colonies, with large nuclei and little peripheral differentiation. In the days before and during puromycin selection, a large amount of cell death is expected. Colonies should begin to become visible around 5 days after puromycin selection is complete. A 7-day post-puromycin colony is shown (red outline). Scale bars= 100 μm.",
    "Mitotically inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) are plated the day before nucleofection and are used to aid the attachment and growth of the nucleofected hPSCs. This protocol uses MEFs at a density of 1 × 106 cells per well of a 6-well plate (9.5 cm2 growth area per well). This protocol also uses 2 × 106 cells of the H9 line of human embryonic stem cells per nucleofection of one sgRNA/condition. The 2 × 106 cells are then plated across 3 wells of a 6-well plate. It is likely that the number of cells required will need to be tested empirically, especially if performing the nucleofection in a cell line other than H9 hPSCs. This is due to inherent differences between hPSC lines and lab-specific cell culture techniques. It is good practice to use the GFP plasmid provided in the Lonza kit as a control for all nucleofection experiments. This will ensure that all reagents are working and that the procedure was followed accurately. Key parameters that should be tested empirically include method of disaggregating cells to single-cell density, number of cells placed per nucleocuvette, nucleofection program, concentration of plasmid added to the cuvette, and density of hPSC prior to nucleofection.",
    "The culture medium of choice should be antibiotic free on the day of nucleofection, as antibiotics can decrease transfection efficiency. In the days after nucleofection, antibiotics can be used. After allowing cells to attach for 30 hr, the culture medium is then supplemented with puromycin for 48 hr in order to select for cells that have taken up the pX459 plasmid. Before nucleofecting cells, it is very important to perform a puromycin kill curve across a range of concentrations on the cell line that will be used, to ensure that the puromycin concentration eliminates all cells. This protocol uses mTeSR1 for culturing hPSCs, though alternative hPSC culture media, for example those that contain Knockdown Serum Replacement (KSR) together with fibroblast growth factor, or other media such as Essential 8 (E8), are likely to also be permissive for nucleofection.\nMaterials\nDR4 MEFs, or other MEFs with neomycin and puromycin resistance\nMEF medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-rec-0002])\nmTeSR1 (STEMCELL Technologies, cat. no. 85850), or hPSC culture medium of choice, without antibiotics\nY-27632 (ROCK inhibitor; Tocris, cat. no. 1254)\nP3 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector X Kit L (Lonza, cat. no.

Feed 50% confluent hPSCs with mTeSR1 supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 16-20 hr prior to nucleofection. Return to incubator overnight.\nThe confluence and growth of hPSCs is an important factor for efficient nucleofection. We find that nucleofecting highly confluent (80%-90%) cells results in lower nucleofection efficiencies than moderately confluent (60%-70%) cells. Overall, the optimal confluency of hPSCs for nucleofection should be determined empirically.\nDay of nucleofection\nHave prepared a surplus of mTeSR1 without antibiotics and supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 for diluting cell suspensions.

Wash each well with 1 ml DPBS then add 1 ml of Accumax or Accutase per well (of a 6-well plate). Ensure even coverage then return to incubator for 10-20 min.\nWhile both Accumax and Accutase are effective for single-cell disaggregation, we find that Accumax allows longer incubation and therefore greater disaggregation, while not compromising cell viability.\n6. Set up 4D nucleofector system using program CB150 (for H9 hESC), then input the number of cuvettes (i.e., the number of conditions) to nucleofect.\nThe program used is an important factor for efficient nucleofection. We also recommend programs CB152, CB156, and CM130 if low efficiencies are detected with CB150.",
    "7. After incubation, quench the Accumax or Accutase with 1 ml mTeSR/Y-27632 per well, and tap to dissociate cells. Pipette gently 5-10 times with a P-1000 pipette tip to form a single-cell suspension, then collect into a 15-ml conical tube.\n8. Take a 250-μl aliquot of the cell suspension for counting.\n9.

Calculate the number of cells in the cell suspension. Calculate the volume of the cell suspension needed for the necessary 2 × 106 cells per condition.\n11. Pellet the required volume of cell suspension by centrifugation for 5 min at roughly 300-375 × g (1200 rpm), room temperature.\n12. Prepare nucleocuvettes with 4 μg pX459 sgRNA or 4 μg GFP control (supplied in the Lonza nucleofection kit)\nCarefully pipette the volume to the very base of the nucleocuvette.\n13. Prepare one 15-ml conical tube per condition with 6 ml of mTeSR1/10 μM Y-27632.\n14.

Add 100 μl of cell suspension to each nucleocuvette. Tap the base gently against a work surface to ensure there are no air bubbles.\n16. Initiate the 4D nucleofector system, running two samples at a time.\n17. Using the supplied Pasteur pipettes, recover the cell suspension from each cuvette and add to the prepared 6 ml of mTeSR1/10 μM Y-27632 medium.\n18.

    "20. Check cells under the microscope, then shake side to side very gently and incubate for 30 hr.\nDay after nucleofection\n21. After incubation for ∼30 hr, check for GFP expression in GFP control condition.\n22. Prepare the required volume of mTeSR1 supplemented with puromycin and feed cells 2 ml per well.\nOptimal puromycin concentration should be determined by performing a puromycin kill curve on the preferred cell line. We recommend concentrations between 0.2 and 0.7 μg/ml\nIf preferred, antibiotic-supplemented medium can be used again from this step onwards.\n23. Refresh mTeSR1/puromycin medium 24 hr later.\n24. After 48 hr of puromycin selection, check GFP control condition to ensure all cells are dead.\n25. Immediately following selection, it is unlikely there will be any visible hPSC colonies. Continue to feed cells with mTeSR without puromycin each day for 2-10 days, after which colonies should begin to appear\n26. Collect cells after a set number of days for downstream applications\nFor targeting of genes suspected to have a role in hPSC renewal or pluripotency, it is recommended to collect shortly after nucleofection, (e.g., 2, 4, and 6 days after puromycin selection), as cells may be competitively disadvantaged in growth.\nFor targeting of genes not suspected to have a role in hPSC renewal or pluripotency, cells can be collected up to 10 days after puromycin selection, or whenever an appropriate amount of high-quality colonies has grown.",
    "A number of approaches can be used to assess the frequency and types of indels observed from CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis. While Sanger sequencing can be used to assess mutagenicity in other systems (Dehairs, Talebi, Cherifi, & Swinnen, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-bib-0017]), it is not recommended for this protocol. The extraction of bulk populations of hPSCs will result in a very large array of indels and frequencies, which will make the resulting sequence difficult to interpret, even with the assistance of decomposition algorithms (Brinkman, Chen, Amendola, & van Steensel, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-bib-0009]).\nCRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis, if performed with minimal off-targets, should result in a large amount of relatively small indel mutations at a specific site in the genome. The number of different permutations of mutations generated makes these sequences ideal for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) approaches such as MiSeq. MiSeq analysis relies on PCR amplification of a 250-450 bp region flanking the target site using primers with MiSeq sequencing adapters at their 5′ and 3′ ends. This PCR reaction will, therefore, amplify all observed indel mutations in the targeted population. The PCR product undergoes a purification step with AMPure XP beads to remove contaminants left over from the PCR reaction, and is then submitted for sequencing. MiSeq analysis provides an in-depth understanding of the mutations produced, and therefore can be used to determine if an sgRNA is highly efficient at facilitating mutations, including the evaluation of the proportion of frameshift mutations produced.\nMaterials\nHarvested nucleofection cell pellets (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-prot-0003])\nQIAGEN DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, cat. no. 69506)\nQ5 High Fidelity Master Mix (New England Biolabs, cat. no.

For MiSeq analysis, generate and order a set of PCR primer oligonucleotides surrounding the target site.\nThe amplicon size should be between 250 and 450 basepairs in length. Note that the MiSeq adapters are 67 bp in length.\n2. Once the optimal conditions and temperature for a set of primers have been identified, order the primers with the following MiSeq adapter sequences:\n         \nForward primer oligo: 5′-TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG-[Forward primer sequence]-3′\nReverse primer oligo: 5′-GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG-[Reverse primer sequence]-3′\n3.

    "5. Bring the AMPure XP beads to room temperature 1 hr before proceeding.\n6. Centrifuge the MiSeq primer PCR reaction plate for 1 min to collect any condensation from the lid.\n7. Vortex the AMPure XP beads for approximately 1 min to ensure beads are evenly distributed. For each sample, pour an equal volume to the PCR reaction product of the AMPure XP beads across a trough (i.e., add 50 μl per sample to the reagent trough).\n8. Using a multichannel pipette, add 50 μl of the AMPure XP beads to each sample in the PCR reaction plate.\n9. Gently pipette the mixture up and down 10 times to distribute evenly.\n10. Incubate at room temperature without shaking for 5 min.\n11. Place the PCR reaction plate on top of a magnetic stand. Position the magnets so that the AMPure XP beads pellet on one side of the tubes, to allow pipetting without disturbing the pellet. Allow the beads to pellet for approximately 2 min.\n12. Working carefully and with a multichannel pipette, remove and discard the supernatant from the PCR reaction plate tubes. If beads are drawn up by the pipette, return the volume and allow the beads to re-pellet on the side of the tube.\n13. With the PCR reaction plate still on the stand, add 200 μl of freshly prepared 80% ethanol to each sample on the plate.\n14. Incubate the PCR reaction plate on the magnetic stand for 30 s at room temperature without shaking.\n15. Carefully remove and discard the supernatant.\n16. Repeat steps 13 to 15 two further times.\n17. Use a P-20 multichannel pipette to remove as much of the supernatant as possible.\n18. With the PCR reaction plate still on the stand, allow the beads to air-dry for 10 min.",
    "19. Remove the PCR reaction plate from the magnetic stand. Add 25 μl of 10 mM Tris, pH 8.5 (Buffer EB from the QIAGEN DNeasy kit) to each well.\n20. Gently mix by pipetting up and down 10 times. Ensure that beads are fully resuspended.\n21. Incubate at room temperature without shaking for 2 min.\n22. Return the PCR reaction plate to the magnetic stand for 2 min to allow the beads to pellet.\n23. Using a multichannel pipette, carefully transfer 20 μl of the supernatant to a set of labelled tubes to be sent for sequencing.\n24. Add gel loading buffer to the remaining 5 μl of the supernatant and run this on a 1.5% TAE agarose gel (see Current Protocols article: Voytas, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-bib-0083]) to verify that the PCR amplicon is present and of good quality.\n25. Submit the purified 20 μl product for MiSeq.\nMiSeq analysis\nHigh-throughput amplicon sequencing, such as that generated with the MiSeq platform, provides a wealth of data regarding the permutations of mutations that exist within a heterogeneous population of targeted cells, such as a bulk pool of hPSCs following CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing. This data output is in the format of .fastq files, which can be collapsed using a variety of tools to provide lists of individual sequences (variants) and the number of reads relating to each variant, that is, the frequency at which each variant was detected within the population. Tools include Galaxy (https://usegalaxy.org/[href=https://usegalaxy.org/]; “Collapsed sequences” function) and the FASTX-Toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/[href=http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/]; “FASTQ/A Collapser” function). The FASTX-Toolkit can be used both online and via the command line. When dealing with a bulk population, the number of variants can reach many hundreds or even thousands, precluding manual analysis of the mutation spectrum.",
    "Instead, bioinformatics tools, both online and command-line, can be used to automate the process of examining MiSeq sequence data (.fastq files) in order to assess the overall efficiency of CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutation and the nature of the individual variants that arise. Aside from the sheer volume of sequence data generated from high-throughput sequencing, sequencing errors can also pose a problem for analysis of CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutagenesis. For this reason, we utilize a bioinformatics pipeline for analysis of MiSeq data that incorporates quality control and unbiased correction of reads, prior to the analysis of mutation efficiency. This pipeline uses dada2 (Callahan et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-bib-0010]) and RACER (Ilie & Molnar, 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-bib-0036]) to implement trimming and correction of MiSeq reads, followed by BWA (Li & Durbin, 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-bib-0048]) to map the corrected reads to a reference genome sequence. The mapped sequences are post-processed with samtools (Li et al., 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-bib-0049]), and then the analysis of indel formation efficiency is performed using the R package CrispRVariants (Lindsay et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-bib-0050]). Further details about the purpose of each script and the variables to edit are found in the Statistical Analysis of the Commentary, below.\n26. Perform quality control and clean-up of the MiSeq-generated .fastq files using the scripts available at https://github.com/galanisl/loh_scripts[href=https://github.com/galanisl/loh_scripts], within the folder ampliconSeq:\n         \nFirst, execute the script check_fastq_quality.R to check the quality of a small number of .fastq files.\ncheck_fastq_quality.R is intended to check, trim and filter around 12 reads at a time in an interactive manner.\nThen, execute the script trim_and_filter.R to correct all .fastq files in a given directory in a fixed manner.\nThen, execute the script correct_fastq.sh.\n27. With the trimmed and corrected read files (.fastq), perform the analysis of the rate of CRISPR-Cas9-mediated indel production using scripts from the github repository: https://github.com/jzohren/crispr-miseq[href=https://github.com/jzohren/crispr-miseq]:\n         \nFirst, create the info_file.csv.\nThen, execute the script crispr.sh.",
    "The crispr.sh script will subsequently launch the crisprvar.r script.\n28. Optimal guides are generally those that consistently produce frameshift mutations in the gene coding region.",
    "After performing MiSeq analysis to identify the sgRNA sequence that facilitates the most efficient production of frameshift mutations, the next step is to derive a clonal population of the null mutant hPSCs by single-cell cloning. This step involves setting up a nucleofection as per Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-prot-0003] (Fig. 5A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-fig-0005]), then picking the colonies that are generated to subsequently disaggregate into single cells. The process of picking colonies involves manual scoring and picking of colonies from the plate, followed by immersion in Accutase and subsequent plating into 12-well plates to expand (Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-fig-0005]). This process should normally be repeated to increase the likelihood of generating a clonal population that comprises cells with identical genotypes. This is because in the original plating some colonies could have merged, resulting in a heterogeneous colony comprising two separate genotypes.\nMaterials\nMatrigel-coated plates (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-rec-0001])\nAccutase (STEMCELL Technologies, cat. no. 07920)\nmTeSR1 (STEMCELL Technologies, cat. no. 85850), or hPSC culture medium of choice, without antibiotics\nY-27632 (ROCK inhibitor; STEMCELL Technologies, cat. no. 72302)\nNucleofected hPSCs (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-prot-0003]; also see step 4, below)\nPhosphate-buffered saline (PBS), without Ca2+ or Mg2+ (Dulbecco's PBS from ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. no. 14040141)\n12-well plate\n96-well plate\nInverted/dissecting microscope\nRepeat pipettors and P-20 and P-200 tips\n37°C biological incubator\n1.

Aspirate medium and wash with 2 ml PBS per well.\nCells should be at least day 5 post puromycin selection to allow the development of moderately sized, robust hPSC colonies.",
    "5. Aspirate PBS and add 1 ml of PBS.\nPBS should only be kept on cells for 5-10 min at a time. Work in batches to harvest the number of colonies needed. Return cells to mTeSR between batches\n6. Identify suitable colonies for passaging. Place the plate on an inverted/dissecting microscope inside a laminar flow hood.\n7. Using a P-20 pipette set at 5 μl, score around the colony to dislodge it.\n8. Gently take up the colony and elute into one of the Accutase-prepared wells of the 96-well plate.\n9. Repeat steps 7 and 8 until 12 colonies have been taken.\n         \nAs mentioned, work in batches of 5-10 min at a time then rejuvenate cells with mTeSR.\n10. Place the 96-well plate into a 37°C incubator for 5 min to dissociate the colony to single-cell density.\n11. During the incubation, aspirate Matrigel from the 12-well plate. Rinse with 0.5 ml of PBS, then add 1 ml of mTesR supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632.\n12. After incubation, remove the 96-well plate from the incubator.\n13. Pipette each well up and down with a P-200 pipette set at 25 μl to dissociate colonies to single cells. Check under the microscope to ensure this.\n14. Transfer 25 μl from a well of the 96-well plate into one well of the 12-well plate.\n15. Repeat step 14 until all 12 colonies have been disaggregated and plated into separate wells.\n16. Gently shake plate side to side to ensure even distribution of cells, then incubate at 37°C overnight.\n17. After 16-24 hr from plating, change the medium to mTeSR without Y-27632. Feed daily with mTeSR.\n18. Optionally, after 4-8 days when colonies are of sufficient size, repeat steps 7-16 to ensure that colonies are derived from single clones and comprise a single homogenous population.",
    "Before embarking on experiments with clonal hPSC lines generated following CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing, it is important to assess the cells for any gross karyotypic abnormalities. PSCs have a shortened cell cycle compared to most other cell types due to a shortened G1 phase, which results in an increased rate of replicative stress (Ahuja et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-bib-0003]). This replicative stress can then result in DSBs, facilitating chromosomal duplication and translocation events (Zeman & Cimprich, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-bib-0091]). hPSCs are therefore prone to acquiring part- or whole-chromosome abnormalities during routine culture (Draper et al., 2004[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-bib-0019]). These aneuploidies can provide cells with a growth advantage (International Stem Cell Initiative, 2011), and therefore drive further genome instability. Additionally, this genomic instability can be exacerbated during the process of CRISPR-Cas9-mediated DNA double-strand breakage and repair, and further by the process of single-cell amplification (Garitaonandia et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-bib-0030]) and the use of Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitors (Weissbein et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-bib-0086]). Indeed, there have been reports of large deletions, and even loss of whole chromosome arms, in response to genome editing in various cellular contexts (Shin et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-bib-0074]; Adikusuma et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-bib-0002]; Kosicki, Tomberg, & Bradley, 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-bib-0045]; Cullot et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-bib-0015]; Owens et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-bib-0064]; Zuccaro et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-bib-0092]; Przewrocka, Rowan, Rosenthal, Kanu, & Swanton, 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-bib-0067]). Therefore, analyzing genome-edited cells for any such genomic aberrations is important because this may interfere with the interpretation of results generated from downstream applications.",
    "There are a number of techniques commonly used to assess the karyotype of hPSCs, including G(Giemsa)-banded karyotyping (McIntire et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-bib-0058]) and array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH; Wu et al., 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-bib-0087]; Elliott, Elliott, & Kammesheidt, 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-bib-0025]). However, these conventional methods of karyotyping are often slow, labor-intensive, and comparatively expensive. Additionally, they generally provide results at only low genomic resolution, ranging from ∼25 kb for array CGH to 3-10 Mb for G-banding (Stephenson et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-bib-0075]). When screening a large number of genome-edited hPSCs, these limitations can present a significant bottleneck and delay experimental progress.\nWe recommend assessing the karyotype of hPSCs following CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing through low-pass whole genome sequencing (WGS; Fogarty et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.232#cpz1232-bib-0028]). This method has the benefits of providing karyotype analysis with rapid turnaround and relatively low costs. 0.1× coverage of WGS is sufficient for robust karyotyping analysis, which depends on the assumption that, in a karyotypically normal sample (without copy number variations (CNVs)), each genomic locus should provide roughly equal read counts, dependent upon their sequence content. Following low-pass WGS, this analysis can be performed bioinformatically. In brief, reads from low-pass WGS are aligned to the latest build of the human reference genome (hg19 build) using BWA version 0.7.17 and copy-number profiles generated using the R package QDNAseq version 1.24.0, using bins of size 100 kb.
