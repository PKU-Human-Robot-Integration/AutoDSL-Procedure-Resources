Each placenta biopsy should include the full thickness of the placenta with both maternal and fetal sides (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1554-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Placenta biopsy\n(A) Representative picture of a human placenta after delivery. The biopsy is taken halfway between the umbilical cord insertion and the margin of the placenta (green dotted circle). Scale bar, 5 cm.\n(B) Picture showing a representative placenta biopsy. Scale bar, 1 cm.\nStore placenta biopsies in sterile PBS containing antibiotics at 4°C until processing to preserve the viability of the tissue.\nNote: We recommend using fresh tissue for the protocol. However, others demonstrated the use of tissue preserved 16 h at 4°C (Cirelli et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nProcessing of placental tissue\nTiming: 45 min\nThis step describes how to process the placental tissue before embedding and slicing. This step should be performed inside a biological safety cabinet.\nRinse the placenta biopsies until the surrounding blood is cleared off (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1554-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Handling and rinsing of human placental tissue\n(A) Gentle rinse of placental tissue with cold sterile PBS supplemented with antibiotics until the tissue is cleared from the surrounding blood.\n(B) Manipulation of placental tissue only at the borders of the fetal membranes with sterile blunt-end forceps to not harm the tissue (white dotted circle).\nNote: To facilitate the rinsing of the well-vascularized placental tissue, the use of cold sterile PBS containing antibiotics is recommended.",
    "Critical: Handle tissue with care and be careful not to disrupt/damage the tissue. Use blunt-end forceps to move the placental tissue by using the borders of the fetal membranes (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nPut placenta biopsies on the cooled cutting board (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1554-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Dissection process of human placenta biopsies with preservation of fetal-maternal orientation\n(A) Picture showing a representative placenta biopsy and the material required to cut and handle the tissue: sterile microtome blade (1) and sterile blunt end-forceps (2). Scale bar, 2 cm.\n(B and C) The placenta biopsy is cut into smaller pieces while maintaining the fetal-maternal orientation. Scale bar, 2 cm.\n(D) The specimens are stored on ice until further processing. Scale bar, 1 cm.\nManually cut placental tissue into smaller pieces using a sterile blade (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B and 4C).\nNote: Cut the tissue by preserving the orientation of the maternal-fetal interface.\nNote: The pieces weigh about 1–1.8 g and should be 0.8–1 × 0.8–1 cm, and 2 cm thick representing the full thickness of the human placenta.\nNote: Prepare several pieces, depending on the number of slices required (expect to obtain approximately 10–12 slices per embedded piece of placenta). Ensure you prepare enough material since not every tissue piece gives the desired number of slices.\nKeep the placenta pieces at 4°C until embedding (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nCritical: Do not store the small placenta specimens in PBS or culture media before embedding, since this leads to loosening of the placental tissue, which can impair the cutting process.\nEmbedding of placental tissue\nTiming: 45–60 min\nThis step describes how to embed placenta pieces into agarose solution. This step should be performed inside a biological safety cabinet.",
    "Critical: Make sure the prepared agarose solution maintains a temperature of 37°C. Agarose solution solidifies at room temperature (20°C) and too hot temperature may harm the tissue.\nPour 1.5 mL 1% agarose solution (prepared in step 9 in before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] section) into a Peel-A-Way embedding mold to cover the bottom (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1554-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Embedding step for small placenta specimens\n(A) Placenta pieces are embedded into agarose solution in square-formed molds and kept on ice.\n(B) Placenta pieces are placed horizontally in the middle of the mold and are surrounded completely by agarose solution. Scale bar, 0.5 cm.\n(C) Embedded tissue is kept on ice until further slicing.\nPlace the mold on ice.\nWait approximately 60 ± 5 s for the agarose solution to start solidifying.\nCritical: Don’t let the agarose solution fully solidify but just enough so that the embedded placenta piece does not sink to the bottom. This ensures full coverage of the tissue with agarose.\nPlace the placenta piece horizontally in the middle of the mold already containing a layer of agarose solution.\nCover the tissue with 1% agarose solution (approximately 3 mL) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nKeep the mold on ice to let the agarose solution fully solidify (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nCritical: While embedding, the work surface should be even to ensure a homogenized distribution of the agarose solution around the tissue and to avoid displacement of the embedded tissue.\nGeneration of precision-cut slices\nTiming: 2–5 h depending on the number of slices required\nThis step describes how to generate precision-cut slices from agarose-embedded tissue using a vibrating tissue slicer. The procedure is carried out on a laboratory workbench.",
    "Fill the buffer tray of the tissue slicer with cold sterile culture media (prepared in step 7 in before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] section) and place it into the ice tray.\nNote: Cold sterile PBS containing antibiotics can be used as well.\nCover the filled buffer tray with the Plexiglas lid to avoid any ice in the culture media.\nFill the ice tray with crushed ice.\nNote: Fill up the ice tray when required to keep the culture media in the buffer tray at 4°C during all the procedures.\nCut at the edges of the mold and down the corners (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A). Open the mold and carefully detach the agarose block (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1554-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Sectioning process of embedded placenta pieces into precision-cut slices\n(A) Molds are cut using a sterile surgical scissor.\n(B) Agarose block is released from the mold without breaking it.\n(C and D) Agarose block is glued on the specimen plate.\n(E) Agarose block on the specimen plate is transferred into the buffer tray containing media or PBS supplemented with antibiotics.\n(F) The section being sliced.\n(G) During slicing, the section is supported by a flat brush.\n(H) Surgical scissors can be used to fully separate the section from the agarose block.\nGlue the agarose block using the cyanoacrylate adhesive onto the specimen plate (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C and 6D).\nCritical: Keep the cyanoacrylate adhesive on ice to maintain its viscosity.\nPlace the specimen plate into the buffer tray using the provided screw and adjust it to the desired position (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]E).\nCritical: Orient the agarose block so that the blade starts cutting at the edge of the block. This reduces the pressure of the blade onto the agarose block, which reduces the risk to detach from the specimen plate.",
    "Critical: Make sure the whole agarose block is covered with culture media. This helps the blade to better slice once in contact with the tissue.\nAdjust the clearance angle of the blade holder following the manufacturer’s instructions.\nNote: A clearance angle of 18° is recommended.\nDefine the cutting window edges to have a defined start and endpoint for cutting following the manufacturer’s instructions.\nWet the blade with culture media from the tray using a sterile brush.\nTrim the agarose block until the blade is in the proximity of the embedded tissue.\nNote: To accelerate the process of trimming, choose an appropriate thickness and higher speed.\nOptional: Manual trimming of the agarose using a blade or scalpel can be performed before gluing the agarose block onto the specimen plate.\nEnter the thickness of interest between 500-700 μm.\nStart the sectioning and discard the first 1–2 sections since they have not yet the defined thickness (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]F).\nNote: During the sectioning process, if required, support slices gently with a sterile brush to avoid that the tissue is pushed down and to keep its contact with the blade (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]G).\nCritical: Be careful not to damage the slices by pushing and avoid pressing down the piece of tissue to not impact the thickness of the section.\nNote: In case the slice did not fully detach from the specimen block, use a sterile surgical scissor, and carefully cut to separate the slice from the specimen block (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]H).\nCollect the floating slices using a flat sterile brush and transfer into the 6-well plate (prepared in step 17 in before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] section) as you go along with cutting.\nPunching of precision-cut slices\nTiming: 15–30 min depending on the number of slices required",
    "This step describes how to punch the precision-cut slices to obtain comparable sizes. This step should be performed inside a biological safety cabinet.\nTo punch the precision-cut slices (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A), use the top of a sterile 1 mL pipette tip (8 mm diameter). Position the top of the tip in the middle of the slice, push it down, and then gently turn the tip while pushing it down (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1554-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Punching and culturing placenta precision-cut slices\n(A) Six-well plate containing the raw sliced sections.\n(B and C) Punching of sections with a 1 mL pipette tip to obtain precision-cut slices (shown in white square following punching) of comparable sizes.\n(D) Scale bar, 1 cm (D) Placental precision-cut slices ready for culture (here placed in PBS for illustration purpose).\nCritical: Maintain the maternal-fetal interface in the placental precision-cut slices by punching in the middle of the sections.\nCritical: Be careful not to damage the slices while punching. Use a small sterile scissor and forceps if the punched slice does not detach completely.\nNote: From one raw placenta precision-cut slice, we obtain 1 punched slice.\nOptional: A disposable, sterile biopsy puncher can be used instead of a 1 mL pipette tip.\nDiscard the surrounding tissue (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]C) and place the slices in 4 mL of culture media at a rate of one slice per well in a 6-well plate at 37°C, 5% CO2 (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]D).\nTo limit the effect of injury caused by tissue slicing/punching, maintain the cultures two days prior to use at 37°C, 5% CO2 and change the media every 24 h (Fahmi et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Gilligan et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3])."
