    "IAA screening and quantification from Klebsiella SGM 81 using Salkowski reagent methodCulture preparationTake preculture medium (without tryptophan) and inoculate it with a single colony of SGM 81 strain, or a loopful of glycerol stock of the strain.Incubate the inoculated pre-culture medium at 30 °C, 120 rpm overnight. This will result in the young culture of the Klebsiella SGM 81 strain which can be used for inoculating IAA production medium (test media). Add 100 μl of the young culture in test medium and vortex it to get a uniform suspension.Incubate it under dark conditions (by wrapping the container with newspaper/aluminum foil) at 30 °C in shaking condition at 120 rpm. Incubation lasts for 24-96 h in dark condition depending on IAA production ability of the strain. Klebsiella SGM 81 produces IAA till 72 h and subsequent decrease in the production in recorded after that.Indole quantification using Salkowaski reagentAfter 24 h, take out 1.5 ml of sample culture broth and transfer to an Eppendorf tube.Centrifuge at 16,278 x g for 5 min using a microcentrifuge.Carefully withdraw 1 ml supernatant and transfer to a new test tube.Mix equal volume (1 ml) of Salkowski reagent, vortex gently and incubate the reaction at 30 °C in a dark condition for 30 min. In a new test tube replace the supernatant with 1 ml of control uninoculated medium and mix with 1 ml of Salkowski reagent. This serves as blank.The presence of IAA is detected by measuring pink color development after 30 min (some strains may develop red color as shown in Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190429/20190429025745_7507.jpgFigure 1.

Measure the color intensity spectrophotometrically at 536 nm using cuvette.",
    "Compare the optical density of the test sample with a standard IAA curve (10-100 μg·ml-1) to calculate the concentration. Repeat the process at similar intervals until the optical density begins to decrease, indicating no further production of IAA.Analysis of IAA by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)Sample preparationPrepare 100 ml nutrient broth medium supplemented with 0.5 g of L-tryptophan in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask.Add 100 μl of the young culture in test medium and vortex it to get a uniform suspension.Incubate it under dark conditions (by wrapping the container with newspaper/aluminum foil) at 30 °C in shaking condition at 120 rpm for 72 h. To separate the cells, centrifuge at 4 °C for 20 min at 2,800 x g and collect 1,000 ml supernatant.Transfer the supernatant to a 250 ml screw-cap glass bottle. Acidify it by adding 2-3 drops of 1 N concentrated HCl to reach pH 2.5-3.To extract IAA, add double the volume of ethyl acetate to the acidified supernatant and shake vigorously for 5 min (alternatively, a separating funnel can be used). Let the mixture stand at room temperature for 10 min to get the top layer of ethyl acetate. Use this layer for further treatment. In a rotary evaporator, set water bath temperature to boiling temperature of ethyl acetate i.e., 77.1 °C (alternatively, ethyl acetate phase can be vacuum dried in a rotational evaporator at 40 °C). The time for drying of the solvent system varies according to the sample volume. Transfer the ethyl acetate layer to the round bottom flask and adjust its rotation to avoid any bumping of the liquid sample.",
    "“Bumping is the phenomenon in chemistry where homogenous liquids boiled in a test tube or other container will super heat and, upon nucleation rapid boiling will expel the liquid from the container (Wikipedia)”–This would leave the IAA escaping the flask into the condenser tube attached with the round bottom flask.Upon complete evaporation of the liquid ethyl acetate, pure IAA is left behind in the crystalline form attached to the bottom of the rotary flask. Switch off all the units of the rotary evaporator and remove the round bottom flask. Re-dissolve the crystalline IAA in 5 ml of 20% methanol and store at -20 °C for future use.LC-MS/MS analysisFilter the stored methanol extract (100 µl) using sterile syringe filters of 0.2 µm so as to separate insoluble particles and larger compounds if any. This is the final analysis sample.Phenomenex Luna C18(2) column (100 mm x 2 mm x 3 µm) at temperature of 50 °C is used as chromatography system.A gradient solvent system of 10% solvent A (2% acetonitrile, 10 mM ammonium formate, pH 4.2) to 90% solvent B (94.9% CH3CN, 5% H2O, 0.1% formic acid) is used for the column over 10 min at a flow rate of 250 ml/min.Wash the column with 90% solvent B for 3 min and then re-equilibrate with 90% solvent A for 6 min. Use 10 µl injections to load the sample for analysis.The MS is configured with a Turbo Spray Ion Drive source where the source temperature is set to 500 °C and the ion spray voltage to 5,500 V. Analyze IAA by Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) in positive mode using a transition of 176 > 130 with collision energy of 20 eV.",
    "Transition of 176 > 130 means the specific pairs of mass to charge (m/z) values associated to the precursor and fragment ions. In our case the Q1 is set to a value of 176 amu and the Q3 to 130 amu, the collision energy was 20 mV.Set the declustering potential, exit potential and collision cell exit potential at 30 V, 10 V and 10 V respectively.In Situ Salkowski stainingPrepare Murashige and Skoog (MSM) basal salt medium with 0.8% agarose, devoid of plant hormone supplements. Sterilize the D. caryophyllus seeds using three-step procedure: a 1 min wash in 70% ethanol, followed by a 4 min wash in 20% NaClO, and a final rinse in sterile distilled water 3 times.Allow the D. caryophyllus seeds to germinate on the MS media by incubating the plates at 25 °C in 14 h light and 10 h dark cycles in a plant culture room, until the root length reaches 2 cm (approximately six days). Treat the germinated plant roots by immersing the root tips into 5 ml of the bacterial suspension with titre 105 CFU ml-1 in the universal tube. Transfer the treated plants onto new MS agar medium devoid of IAA and sucrose in square Petri plates (120 mm x 120 mm x 15 mm).Again, incubate the plates at 25 °C in 14 h light and 10 h dark cycles in a plant culture room.After two weeks of infection, stain the treated roots with Salkowski reagent. To stain the roots, add 400 μl of Salkowski reagent on each root and observe any visible color change. The development of pink color as shown in the figure below indicates the presence of proximal IAA on and around the roots (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190429/20190429025825_3941.jpgFigure 2.",
