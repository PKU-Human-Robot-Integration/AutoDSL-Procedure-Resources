    "Automated imaging of growing Arabidopsis roots stained with a vital dye (see Video 1 and Figure 2)<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Preparation of the Lab-Tek® observation chamber for FM4-64 staining. Pour 3 ml of ½ MS-0.8% agar with 5 μl of 100 mg/ml FM4-64 in the Lab-Tek® observation chamber.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170414/20170414220545_9815.jpgFigure 2. Preparation of the Lab-Tek® observation chamber for FM4-64 staining. A. Drop 5 μl of 100 mg/ml FM4-64 into the observation chamber; B. Add 3 ml of pre-heated ½ MS-0.8% agar; C. Mix gently to homogenize; D. Let cool down and solidify.Incubate seedlings in the FM4-64 bath (1 μg/ml FM4-64 in liquid ½ MS) for 5 to 10 min (time required for the preparation of the Lab-Tek® observation chamber). Prepare ½ MS-0.8% agar-FM4-64 in the Lab-Tek® observation chamber (see Recipes section and Video 2 and Figure 3). While seedlings incubate in the FM4-64 bath, pour ½ MS-0.8% agar-FM4-64 in the Lab-Tek® chamber, wait until it has solidified and dried.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Transfer of seedlings in the observation chamber. Cut out a piece of ½ MS-agar, add ½ MS and align carefully seedlings prior to putting back the squared piece of ½ MS-agar. Proceed to observation (FM4-64 staining) or let it stand several hours in a growth chamber so that seedlings acclimate to the Lab-Tek® chamber.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170414/20170414220749_0993.jpgFigure 3. Transfer of seedlings in the observation chamber. If working without FM4-64, start the procedure at panel (C). In this case, prefer working under sterile conditions. A. Prepare a solution of ½ MS-FM4-64 at 1 μg/ml final concentration; B. Transfer the seedlings into the solution and incubate them for 5 min; C. In the meantime, cut a squared block of agar in the Lab-Tek® observation chamber; D. Then remove it from the chamber using a coverslips; E.",
    "Add 200 μl of ½ MS in the hole left in the chamber; F. Transfer the seedlings into the Lab-Tek® observation chamber. If you plan to leave Lab-Tek® observation chamber in a growth chamber overnight (when working without FM4-64), make sure seedlings are roughly aligned. G. Put the block of agar back inside the Lab-Tek® chamber, on top of either the whole seedlings, or only of their root system. H. Gently chase air bubbles with a gloved fingertip; I. Seedlings are ready for observation or to be grown overnight.Cut a squared area of agar in the chamber. The piece of agar should go from one side of the chamber to the other, and be as wide as a coverslip (20 x 24 mm). Using a coverslip, remove the agar block from the observation chamber and keep it aside for later use (see step A6). Pour 200 µl of liquid ½ MS in the hole left by the removal of the agar block.Carefully align up to 4 seedlings in the Lab-Tek® observation chamber.Put back the cube of ½ MS-agar-FM4-64 on top of the seedling(s), chasing air bubbles manually (gently using a gloved fingertip).Place the sample under a microscope. Locate the first root tip by direct bright field observation under the microscope.Go to step B8.Automated imaging of growing Arabidopsis roots expressing fluorescent proteins (see Naramoto et al., 2015; Aki and Umeda, 2016 for detailed alternatives procedure)Under the sterile hood, pour 3 ml of pre-heated ½ MS-0.8% agar in the observation chamber and let it cool down.Use the scalpel to cut a squared area of agar (20 x 24 mm) from one side to the other of the chamber, and as wide as a coverslip.",
    "Use a coverslip to remove the piece of agar from the observation chamber and keep it aside for later use (see step B5).Pour 200 µl of liquid ½ MS in the hole left by the removal of the agar block.Carefully align up to 4 seedlings in the observation chamber.Gently put back the cube of ½ MS-0.8% agar-FM4-64 on top of the seedling(s). Whole small/young seedlings can be positioned between the agar block and the bottom of the chamber. For longer/older seedlings, only the root system can be positioned between the agar and the bottom, with the aerial part of the seedling rising out of the agar. Chase air bubbles manually, gently using a gloved fingertip.Leave the plants to grow in their new environment, with an inclination of ± 70° of angle, in a growth chamber overnight, so that seedlings acclimate to the observation chamber and keep growing.Place the sample under a microscope. Locate the first root tip by bright field observation under the microscope.In Metamorph, use the menu ‘Apps’ > ‘Multi Dimensional Acquisition’ (MDA).In the ‘Main’ tab, choose the dimensions ‘Timelapse’, ‘Multiple Stage Positions’, ‘Multiple Wavelengths’ (even if you have only one position and/or one channel) and ‘Run journals’. These modalities are required. You can use the options ‘Z series’ and ‘Stream’ too if needed (Figure 4): these modalities are optional, but compatible with each other.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170414/20170414221132_4268.jpgFigure 4. The Multi Dimensional Acquisition Main tab: Timelapse, Multiple Stage Positions (even for only one), Multiple Wavelengths (even for only one) and Run Journals are required. Z series and Stream are optional.Choose an empty folder to save the images. You must not use ‘_w’ or ‘_s’ in the base name of the images.",
    "Change the other settings of the selected tabs of the MDA menu as needed (use the same settings as for a regular time-lapse acquisition): you could use the settings displayed in Figure 5 as a starting point. If you use the ‘Z series’ option, make sure you remember slice number that should be used for the registration (we use the central slice of the stack most of the time; Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170414/20170414221250_8241.jpgFigure 5. An example of the settings we often use for the tabs of the MDA module. In the Z series, make sure you remember the number of steps (here, 121) in E: if you want to use the central slice for the registration, you need to use the number 60 for the ‘Slice used for registration’ in step B15.In the ‘Journal’ menu, choose ‘CL_ini-Pos-Ch.jnl’ for ‘end of stage position’, ‘CL_ini-Pos-Ch-finished.jnl’ for ‘end of acquisition’, ‘CL_ini-Pos-Ch-finished.jnl’ for ‘on cancel’ (Figure 6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170414/20170414221348_5847.jpgFigure 6. The Multi Dimensional Acquisition Journal tab. Choose the proper journal for each category.You should save the settings of the MDA in a file (‘save state...’ in the Main tab) for the next time. Do not start the acquisition with Metamorph yet.Start ImageJ/Fiji and run the macro CL-root-track-MM_63multiD.ijm.A window pops up. Fill in the ‘Number of positions’ (as in the MDA, 1 or more), the ‘Channel used for registration’ (the channel number in the MDA, 1 or more), and the ‘Slice used for registration’ (as explained in step B11; Figure 7)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170414/20170414221435_8324.jpgFigure 7. Fill in the macro pop-up window with the appropriate numbers, according to the settings chosen in the MDA module. Here is an example that is compatible with Figure 5.Another window pops up. Select the folder used in the MDA to save the images.Do not close ImageJ or any of its opened windows. Go back to Metamorph.",
    "Select in the menu ‘Journal’ > ‘Journal control’ > ‘Stopwatches’: let the new window opened.Start the acquisition with the ‘Acquire’ button in the MDA (see Note 4)."
