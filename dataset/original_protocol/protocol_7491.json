  "procedures": [
    "The following procedure is based on using a standard 96-well plate containing 100 μL per well. Every volume and step are indicated on a per well basis. However, the protocol works for any container and adherent cell type if the volumes are adjusted accordingly. Numbers in bold indicate the final dilution.For every step described in section C, the sample needs to be protected from light at all times. This is essential for the protocol to work. The procedure works best when using automated liquid handling, which necessitates building light-protecting containers around the machines. If manual handling is performed, keep the light as dim as possible, and preferentially at wavelengths above ~600 nm.When performing 4i on tissue culture cells, perform A and then repeat C and D to achieve the desired level of multiplexing. In the last 4i cycle, perform C, E, and D. 4i works well with poorly adherent cell lines, which require a coated surface (e.g., poly-lysine). However, liquid handling should be performed very cautiously.When performing 4i on tissue sections, perform B and then repeat C and D to achieve the desired level of multiplexing.Sample preparation, tissue culture cells Prepare the fixation solution (FS, see Recipes) and the permeabilization solution (PS, see Recipes).Perform experiment as desired.Add 100 μL of FS. 1:2 Incubate at RT for 20 min.Wash three times with 100 μL of PBS.Aspirate to a volume of 50 μL.Add 50 μL of PS. 1:2 Incubate at RT for 10 min.Wash three times with 100 μL of PBS.Aspirate to a volume of 100 μL.Store the plate at 4 °C until proceeding to Section C.Sample preparation, FFPE (tissue sections) Place the microtiter plate superstructure over the glass bottom.",
    "Mark the position of the microtiter plate well on the glass bottom by running the water-resistant, ethanol-soluble pen along the inside of each well while the pen is also touching the glass bottom. Each well will contain one tissue section.Remove the plate superstructure and turn the glass bottom over.Using a PAP pen, encircle all well markings with one single line. This line will serve as a tension barrier in the next step.Add 7.5 mL of Poly-L-Lysine inside the PAP pen line and ensure that the whole surface within the surface tension barrier is covered by the solution.Incubate in a chemical hood at RT for 1 h.Remove the Poly-L-Lysine solution from the glass bottom by aspiration or by gently tipping the glass bottom on its side.Use a water microtome cutter to generate sections 2–6 μm thick of the precooled paraffin block and let them float in the water bath of the microtome. A detailed protocol for cutting the paraffin sections can be found in Wang and Hasnain (2017).Insert the glass bottom at a 45° angle into the water bath, with the coated side facing the samples.Using the well markings, place the edge of the paraffin on the slanted plate and pull the plate out at a 45° angle.Dry the glass bottom slide in a plate at 37 °C for 2 min.Repeat steps 7–10 until you have transferred all sections to your slides, or all positions on the slide are occupied by sections. Do not resubmerge areas that have sections recently placed on them!Store the glass bottom slide at 37 °C overnight.To perform deparaffinization, place the glass bottom slide in a glass container, on top of two microscopy glass slides with the sections facing upwards.For the following steps (15–22), use volumes that ensure that the glass bottom is just about covered.",
    "Do not pour the solutions directly onto the glass bottoms.Histoclear three times for 4 min.Histoclear one time for 3 min.100% EtOH two times for 2 min.96% EtOH two times for 2 min.80% EtOH one time for 2 min.70% EtOH one time for 2 min.50% EtOH one time for 2 min.PBS one time for 2 min.Place 40 mL of 10× Antigen Retrieval solution together with 360 mL of ddH2O in a steamer.In the steamer, place a sieve close to the steam source.Place the glass bottom with deparaffinized sections on or into the sieve, with the sections facing upwards.Turn the steamer on and set it to run for 40 min. Every 10 min, rotate the sieve by 90°.Switch off the steamer, carefully tilt the plate at an angle, and let it air dry for 1 h.Place the glass bottom with the sections facing up on a kitchen towel, positioned on a firm surface.To combine the glass bottom with the plastic superstructure, first expose the adhesives of the plastic superstructure and then align the wells to the sections as best as possible.Lightly press the glass to the superstructure through the edges, to ensure that all points of interest have no bubbles in them.Add 50 μL of ddH2O per well.Add 50 μL of ES per well.Incubate at RT for 90 min.Add 33.33 μL of FS.Wash five times with 100 μL of H2O.Store the plate at 4 °C until proceeding to Section C.Indirect iterative (cyclic) immunofluorescence imaging on tissue culture cells and tissue sections Reminder: Keep the sample protected from light at all times.Prepare the elution buffer (EB, see Recipes), the 4i blocking buffer (sBB, see Recipes), and the conventional blocking buffer (cBB, see Recipes).Wash five times with 100 μL of ddH2O.Aspirate to a volume of 30 μL.Add 100 μL of EB. 1:1.",

    "184A1 cells were deprived of serum and growth factor for 16 h, and then stimulated with 100 ng/mL EGF for 5 min before fixation. Then, 4i was performed as described for the tissue culture cells. Representative composites of a 30-plex experiment are displayed with the stained epitopes indicated. The same field of view is shown in all composites.
