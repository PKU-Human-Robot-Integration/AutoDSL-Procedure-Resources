    "All animal experiments were executed in compliance with all relevant guidelines, regulations, and regulatory agencies. The present protocol being demonstrated was performed under the guidance and approval of the Institute of Microcirculation Animal Ethics Committee (IMAEC) at the Peking Union Medical College (PUMC).\n1. Animals\nBefore the start of the experiment, keep three BALB/c mice per cage, with controlled temperature (24 ± 1 °C) and humidity (55 ± 5%), under a 12-h light-dark cycle. Allow the mice free access to regular food and water.\nRandomly divide the mice into a non-diabetic control group and a diabetic group. Accurately weigh each individual mouse and calculate the injection volume using the body mass of each mouse.\nFast the mice for 4 h before streptozotocin (STZ) injection and provide regular water as normal on experimental day 1.\nPrepare 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer at pH 4.3. Put 1 mL of the solution into a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube and wrap the microcentrifuge tube in aluminum foil to avoid light exposure.\nDissolve the STZ in sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.3) to a final working concentration of 5 mg/mL before use.\nGive the mice of the diabetic group intraperitoneal injections of STZ at a dose of 40 mg/kg using a 1-mL syringe and a 25-G needle. Inject the mice of the non-diabetic control with the same volume of sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.3).\nPut the mice back into the cages and supply them with regular food and 10% sucrose water.\nRepeat steps 1.3-1.7 on experimental days 2 to 5 (i.e., the next 4 consecutive days).\nReplace the 10% sucrose water with regular water after the last STZ injection.",
    "Fast the mice for 6 h, but give them free access to water, and measure their blood glucose levels nine days later (experimental day 14). Collect a blood sample from the tail vein to confirm hyperglycemia using a blood glucose monitoring system.\n\tNOTE: Mice with blood glucose levels > 200 mg/dL are considered diabetic.\n2. Preparation of the Instrument\nClean the optical surfaces of the probe tip and probe connector of the laser Doppler apparatus with a soft, non-abrasive cloth to remove any dust or particles. Plug the cable into the port of the instrument (Figure 1A).\nAssemble the calibration stand by allowing the flux standard to be in thermal equilibrium with experimental surroundings (room temperature, usually for 30 min). Shake the flux standard gently for 10 s and let it rest for 2 min.\nPosition the flux standard container in the middle of the calibration base. Adjust the clamp to the maximum height and secure the probe in the clamp such that it points downwards to the container. Make sure the flux standard is correctly positioned underneath the probe.\nSlowly move the probe down until the tip is correctly submerged in the flux standard. Select and press \"calibration\" on the laser Doppler apparatus and choose the working channel that the probe is connected to. Run the calibration program until a \"Calibration successful\" notice is displayed on the screen of laser Doppler apparatus.\nSecure the probe using probe holders. Manually secure the probe to avoid movement.\nMaintain the experimental room at constant temperature (24 ± 1 °C) and humidity (~50-60%).\nTurn off any external light (such as fluorescent and spot lamps) before performing the experiment to avoid external light-induced change.\n3. Preparation of the Animals\nAutoclave the surgical instruments and allow them to cool to room temperature before use.",
    "Give the mice 10 min to acclimatize to the experimental environment before detecting pancreatic islet microvascular vasomotion by laser Doppler.\nFill a 1-mL syringe with 1 mL of 3 % pentobarbital sodium. Inject the pentobarbital sodium solution (75 mg/kg i.p.) to anesthetize the mice.\nCover the eyes of the mouse with pre-moistened medical gauze to prevent dryness.\nEnsure that the mouse completely loses consciousness and no longer responds to tail or hindfoot pinches with forceps. Monitor the anesthesia throughout the anesthetic and intra-operative event every 15 min. Maintain the anesthesia by supplementing with 10 % of the initial injection volume of the pentobarbital solution when necessary.\nPlace a heating pad with a semi-insulating layer below the animal and place the animal in supine position and transfer it to the working station of the laser Doppler apparatus. Fix the mouse to the working platform with surgical tape.\nSwab the abdominal skin of the mouse with betadine, and then 75% ethanol is used to swab the abdominal area clean.\nInject 2% lidocaine/0.5% bupivacaine (50/50) mixture subcutaneously.  Cut a ~3 cm-diameter hole in the center of a gauze sponge. Cover the abdominal region with the gauze sponge.\nLift the abdominal skin with forceps and make an initial vertical incision along the midline of abdomen using a scalpel or skin scissors.\nGrasp the underlying muscle with forceps and incise to enter the abdominal cavity. Do not injure any organs. Fold the skin and underlying muscle over the chest to reveal the abdominal cavity. Gently expose the pancreatic body and the spleen using a pair of blunt-nosed forceps.\n4. Data Acquisition for Analysis",
    "Run the software of the laser Doppler apparatus by clicking on \"File\" → \"New\" to create a new measurement file. To configure the connected monitors, under the \"General\" tab, set up the monitoring duration to \"Free run.\" Use the factory default for the \"LDF Monitor\" tab. Click \"Next.\"\nSet up the graph display in the \"display setup dialog box.\" Select the \"Flux, Conc, Speed\" channels by checking the respective boxes. Select the following parameters: \"Data source for the channel\" and \"Label, Units and Color.\" Click \"Next.\"\nEnter user information about the subject and measurement (i.e., name and subject number, operator, monitoring time, comments, etc.) in the \"file information dialog box\" and click \"Next\" to finish the measurement configuration.\n\tNOTE: A measurement window is automatically created by the software (Figure 1B).\nManually advance the electrode to the pancreas. Make sure the distance between the probe and pancreas tissues is within 1 mm. An inappropriate distance gives an artificially increased or decreased blood flow reading.\nClick the \"Start\" toolbar icon to start recording the microvascular blood perfusion units (PU) data. Collect the PU data continuously for 1 min every run. Click \"Stop\" to stop the measurement. Select \"File\" → \"Save as\" to name and save the finished measurement file.\nManually reposition the probe after each run to avoid additive effects and the localized exhaustion of contractile and relaxation capacity. Repeat steps 4.1-4.4 to harvest multi-point (i.e., three randomly chosen points from pancreatic tissue) microvascular PU data for each mouse. Measure the PU data of a non-reflective plate as a baseline control.\nClose the abdominal muscle layer and the skin layer with a suture. Place the animals in clean cages after the experiments.\nKeep the animal warm by placing the recovery cage half-on the heating pad.",
    "NOTE: Pay attention to warmth, hygiene, fluid and food intake, and infection. Administrate mice with 2 mg/kg Carprofen for 48 h as postoperative pain management.  Perform euthanasia by injecting 150 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium i.p. when mice are observed to be in a state of severe pain or distress that cannot be alleviated.\n5. Calculating the Parameters of Microvascular Vasomotion\nUse the \"Export\" command of the laser Doppler software to export the time and PU raw data as a *.xlsx file and open the file in a spreadsheet.\nCalculate the average baseline perfusion unit (PUb) (see step 4.6).\nCalculate the average blood perfusion (PUa) for 1 min of a measurement as follows: Average blood perfusion (PUa) = PU - PUb (Equation 1).\nCalculate the frequency (cycles/min) for each 1 min of measurement.\n\tNOTE: The frequency of microvascular vasomotion is defined as the number of peaks that occurred in a microvascular vasomotion wave per minute.\nCalculate the amplitude (ΔPU) for each 1 min of measurement.\n\t\nCalculate the amplitude of microvascular vasomotion as the difference between the maximum (PUmax) and minimum (PUmin): Amplitude (ΔPU) = PUmax - PUmin (Equation 2).\nCalculate the relative velocity (PU) for each 1 min of measurement.\nSubscription Required.
