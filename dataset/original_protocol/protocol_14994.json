    "The method is suitable for formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin embedded tissue sections. The technique is demonstrated here in its application to experimental stroke in rat.\n1. Preparing Components for Tyramide Signal Amplification (TSA) System\nAlthough the TSA-based enhancement is used in the final stage of labeling, preparing for this reaction can take more than 1 hr. Therefore it is convenient to make the TSA reagents before starting the labeling.\nMake fluorophore tyramide stock solution. Use the fluorophore tyramide reagent supplied in individual vials with the TSA labeling kit. Add 300 µl DMSO to the tyramide reagent vial. Fluorophore tyramide stock solution is stable for at least 3 months when stored at 4 °C.\nMake TNT wash buffer containing: 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 0.15 M NaCl; 0.05% Tween-20. If needed 0.3% Triton X-100 can be substituted for the 0.05% Tween-20. Alternatively PBS may be used as wash buffer.\nMake TNB blocking buffer containing: 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 0.15 M NaCl; 0.5% Blocking Reagent (supplied with kit). To completely dissolve the blocking reagent, slowly add it in small increments to the buffer while stirring. Heat this solution gradually to 55 °C with continuous stirring. This can take 30-60 min. The solution will appear milky. Bring to room temperature before using. Aliquot and store at -20 °C for long-term use.\n2. Preparation of Sections\nUse slides with mounted 5 μm-thick sections cut from formalin-fixed tissues.\nTreat sections with xylene for 15 min.\nRehydrate sections as follows: soak in 96% EtOH 2x for 5 min each; soak in 80% EtOH for 5 min; wash with water 2x for 5 min each.\nMake Proteinase K working solution by diluting Proteinase K stock solution to 50 µg/ml in PBS.",
    "Add Proteinase K working solution to sections. Incubate 15 min at 23 °C. The volume of the solution and the time of digestion may need to be adjusted depending on the size of sections and tissue types. For a small (below 5 mm in diameter) section 50 µl of Proteinase solution would be sufficient. For an average size (~10 mm in diameter) section, add 100 µl of Proteinase K solution. For very large sections the volume of the solution can be scaled up. In all cases take care to prevent overdigestion of sections which leads to complete loss of signal and destroys tissue morphology. This often happens if incubation time exceeds 25 min.\nWash sections in distilled water 2x for 5 min each. Prepare the labeling mix containing active probe while sections are in water.\n3. VACC TOPO-based Staining\nPrepare the active probe solution by combining the following:\n\tWater - 11.75 µl\n\t1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 - 1.25 µl\n\t100 pmol of 12-base overhang suicide oligonucleotide - 1 µl\n\t100 pmol of adapter oligonucleotide - 1 µl\n\t50 pmol VACC TOPO - 10 µl\nMix gently by pipetting. Incubate at room temperature (23 °C) for 15 min to allow for probe activation.\nTake sections from wash jar and aspirate the remaining water. Then apply the active probe solution prepared in step 3.1 (25 µl per ~10 x 10 mm section).\nCoverslip the sections and incubate for 15 min at 23 °C. Dip slides in water to gently remove coverslips. Wash in water 3x for 5 min each.\n4. TSA Signal Enhancement\nCover tissue sections with TNB blocking buffer prepared earlier and incubate slides in a humidified chamber for 30 min at room temperature (23 °C).",
    "Prepare a 1:100 dilution of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugates (SA-HRP) in TNB blocking buffer. Aspirate TNB blocking buffer and apply SA-HRP solution. Incubate slides with SA-HRP for 30 min at room temperature. Use adequate reagent volume to cover the tissue section, generally 100 µl per section.\nWash slides 3x for 5 min each in TNT wash buffer (or PBS) at room temperature.\nPrepare a 1:50 dilution of fluorophore tyramide stock in 1x Amplification Diluent from the kit. Pipette the fluorophore tyramide working solution onto each slide. Use enough working solution to completely cover the tissue section, generally 100 µl per section. Make fluorophore tyramide working solution immediately before each labeling. The solution cannot be reused, so discard any unused portion of it after labeling.\nIncubate the slides at room temperature for 3 to 10 min. Monitor fluorescence increase under microscope until the first hints of structures can be seen. Quickly proceed to wash step.\nWash slides 3x for 5 min each in TNT wash buffer (or PBS) at room temperature with agitation.\nAdd the antifading solution with DAPI and coverslip. Observe under the fluorescence microscope. To visualize DAPI and FITC fluorescence use a band-pass filter set:\n\tFITC excitation D490/40, emission 520/10; DAPI excitation D360/40, emission 460/20, or similar.\nSubscription Required.
