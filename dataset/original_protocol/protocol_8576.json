  "procedures": [
    "All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC; Office of Laboratory Animal Resources, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus).\n1. Zebrafish Husbandry\nRaise and maintain adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) at 28.5 °C on a 10 h dark/14 h light cycle and with appropriate water treatment and exchange52.\nRaise zebrafish embryos/larvae at 28.5 °C in embryo medium until they reach the desired stage (e.g., 2 dpf).\n2. Preparation of Dissection Materials\nGlue dispenser for zebrafish dissection\n\tNOTE: This protocol involves the use of veterinarian suture glue to attach the preparation to the recording chamber. Successful use of the suture glue requires the application of small amounts of glue in a controlled manner. The glue begins to harden as soon as it encounters an aqueous environment. Therefore, draw the glue into a micropipette and deliver small amounts using a home-made \"glue dispenser\" that allows the application of negative or positive pressure by mouth. The central part of the glue dispenser is a glass bore, a piece that is included within the package containing the borosilicate thin-wall glass capillaries (Figure 1A). On one end, the bore is connected via a piece of flexible tubing to a mouthpiece, while the other end holds the glass micropipette (Figure 1).\n\t\nRemove the black bulb from one glass bore and replace it with the white rubber adapter from another glass bore (Figure 1B and 1C).\n\t\tNOTE: This double-adapter-capped glass bore allows connection to a glass micropipette on one end and, at the other end, to a piece of flexible tubing via a small, straight polypropylene fitting (Figure 1B, inset).",
    "Cut a piece of flexible tubing to a length of ~38 cm. Attach the mouthpiece (e.g., a yellow 200 µL micropipette tip) to the end of the flexible tubing not connected to the glass bore.\n\t\tNOTE: The piece of tubing should be long enough to allow manipulation of the glass micropipette under a dissecting scope while the micropipette yellow tip is in the mouth (Figure 1D).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55507/55507fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Glue dispenser. (A-C) A glass bore connects to flexible tubing at one end and the glass micropipette at the other. The rubber adapters allow attachment via a small polypropylene fitting (B, inset) to the tubing and, eventually, to a glass micropipette at the other end. (D) The final glue dispenser has a mouthpiece (e.g., made from a plastic pipette tip) at one end of the tubing and the glass bore with the attached micropipette at the other (arrowhead).\nDissection/recording chamber\n\tNOTE: The dissection chamber also serves as the electrophysiology recording chamber. The chamber is formed on a glass slide using pre-cut pieces of cured silicone elastomer (Figure 2A).\n\t\nTo prepare the silicone elastomer, add the base and the curing agent to a plastic conical tube at a 4:1 ratio, respectively.\nMix the elastomer base and the curing agent thoroughly and pour the mix into two 100 mm Petri dishes. Pour the elastomer to a thickness of <1 mm in one Petri dish and ~2.5 mm in the other.\nAllow the silicone elastomer to cure by exposure to air for ~4-5 days. If cured elastomer is needed sooner, incubate it at 60 °C.\nCut pieces of the cured silicone elastomer to the following sizes:",
    "From the ~1 mm-thick cured elastomer, cut out a ~3.8 x 6.3 cm rectangle; this piece serves as the bottom of the chamber (Figure 2A). From the ~2.5 mm-thick cured silicone, cut a rectangle ~3.8 x 6.3 cm. From the latter rectangle, cut out an internal rectangle ~2.5 x 5 cm; the resulting frame serves as the top of the chamber (Figure 2A).\nTo make the dissection/recording chamber, place the thin silicone rectangle directly on top of a glass slide (5 x 7.6 cm), making sure to remove any air bubbles between the silicone and the glass (Figure 2A). Place the silicone rectangle frame, cut from the thicker elastomer, on top of the thin bottom layer of silicone.\nVerify that the silicone layers attach well to each other and that there are no air bubbles between the two layers (Figure 2A).\nAfter use, dismantle the chamber by removing the thick rectangle silicone frame from the bottom silicone layer that is attached to the glass slide. Rinse the silicone surfaces with ddH2O prior to use and after each recording session and dry with low-lint wipes.\nStore the chamber dry to prevent fungal growth between the two pieces of silicone.\n\t\tNOTE: If toxins or pharmacological agents that may not rinse readily from the silicone are used, dedicate specific chambers for those purposes.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55507/55507fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2: Electrophysiology chamber and dissection tools. (A)The chamber used for the dissections and electrophysiological recordings consists of a glass slide upon which are placed two pieces of cured silicone elastomer, layered on top of each other to provide a frame and a bottom for a well. The size of the well, ~2.5 x 5 cm, allows the use of small volumes (2-2.5 mL) of extracellular recording solution. The bottom silicone layer allows for secure positioning of the zebrafish embryo using tissue adhesive that does not adhere to glass. (B) A glass micropipette (top) is used for glue delivery during the dissection. The thin-wall glass is pulled to create a long, tapered end that is later cut, creating a tip with a diameter of ~75 µm. The tapered glass micropipette is attached to the free end of the glue dispenser (Figure 1D, arrowhead) and front-filled with glue through the application of suction. The other micropipette (bottom), pulled as for one used for a patch-clamp recording, is used for the transection of the hindbrain and for skin removal. (C) Under an upright microscope, a micromanipulator is used to maneuver the micropipette for the final dissection steps. A glass micropipette, as in B, bottom, is attached to the electrode holder (arrow). Muscle removal is achieved by applying suction through the tubing connected to the air outlet (arrowhead). At its other end, the tubing connects to a stopcock (black arrowhead) that, on its other side (asterisk), has tubing attached to a mouthpiece.\n3. Dissection of Embryos and Larvae for Patch-clamp Recordings from Spinal Neurons\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55507/55507fig3.jpg",
    "Figure 3: Dorsal dissection of a zebrafish spinal cord. (A-A') After hindbrain transection (a) of a 2-dpf embryo, the skin is cut on the left and right sides of the embryo (b). A second cut, perpendicular to the first, is then performed (c). Next, the skin is lifted using a micropipette, allowing tweezers to grab and pull away the skin. (B) Removal of the skin exposes the dorsal spinal cord. Rostral to the black line, the skin has been removed and the surface of the spinal cord (asterisk), contained within the meninges, is exposed. The skin remains intact caudal to the black line (arrow). (C-C') The tip of the glass micropipette is pressed on the meninges, and swift, lateral, short movements are performed to pierce the meninges. (D-D' and E-E') Once the meninges are pierced (D-D'), the micropipette is advanced and (E-E') moved rostrally to tear the meninges into two segments. The somata of Rohon-Beard neurons typically emerge upon removal of the meninges (arrow). (F-G') In a 7-dpf larva, layers of muscle cover the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord, hindering access to Rohon-Beard neurons. Following the removal of the skin, the larva is treated with 0.05% collagenase. (F) A 5 min incubation with 0.05% collagenase is too stringent, resulting in excessive muscle damage, as evidenced by the frayed muscle (arrow and inset). (F') Excessive collagenase treatment may also damage Rohon-Beard neurons (arrow), revealed here by their expression of gfp in the Tg(islet2b:gfp) line. In theTg(islet2b:gfp) line, dorsal root ganglion neurons also express gfp (arrowhead). A briefer 1 min incubation with 0.05% collagenase sufficiently loosens the muscle (G) while conserving the myotome morphology (arrow and inset). (G') Pigment cells are present on top of the most dorsal muscle layer (arrowhead).",

    "Dissection of embryos for recordings from Rohon-Beard cells\nPlace an embryo in a dissection chamber containing ~2-3 mL of Ringer's solution (Figure 2A). Immobilize the embryo by adding ~100 µL of 0.4% tricaine solution to the chamber.\nPull thin-wall glass micropipettes on a micropipette puller using a box filament to obtain a long, thin tip, similar to an injection micropipette (Figure 2B, top)53.\nAttach the pulled glass micropipette to the glass bore of the glue dispenser. Under the dissecting microscope, use tweezers to break the tip of the glass micropipette so that the tip is ~75 µm (Figure 2B, top).\n\t\tNOTE: The tip size should be large enough to allow efficient loading of the glue into the tip through the application of negative pressure (mouth suction) to front-fill the micropipette, but small enough to allow the precise application of the glue via positive pressure.\nLoad the glass micropipette with ~3-5 µL of glue by applying suction through the mouthpiece. Bring the glue-filled tip to the dissection chamber.\n\t\tNOTE: Filling the micropipette with glue requires strong suction. If the micropipette fills quickly with weak suction, the tip is too large.\nPlace the embryo in the recording chamber (Figure 3A and 3A'); for recordings from embryos and young larvae (≤72 hpf), there is no need to remove muscle tissue.\nBring the tip of the glue-loaded micropipette near the head of the embryo/larva while maintaining slight positive pressure to the micropipette via the mouth tube (to prevent the entry of aqueous solution). Once the tip is near the head of the embryo, apply sufficient positive pressure to expel a small drop of glue onto the bottom of the chamber.",
    "NOTE: The glue hardens once in contact with the aqueous solution, so it is important to apply and maintain mild positive pressure as it is placed in the dissection solution.\nUse a dissecting pin tool to move the embryo/larva towards the drop of glue so that the head makes contact with the glue. Orient the embryo dorsal-side up and press on the head to ensure good contact with the glue.\nAs the glue slowly hardens, use the dissecting pin to re-position the embryo/larva so that it lies ventral-side down, dorsal-side up. Dip the dissecting pin tool into the drop of glue and draw threads of the glue over and across the head of the embryo to further secure its position.\n\t\tNOTE: Tricaine speeds up the rate at which the glue hardens. To allow more time to work with the glue, use the minimal amount of tricaine required to immobilize the embryo/larva. Additionally, the hardening rate may vary with different lots of glue. Accordingly, when using a new batch of glue, ascertain its rate of hardening before using it for dissection.\nOnce the head is securely attached to the silicone and the glue has solidified, sacrifice the embryo/larva by transection at the hindbrain level with another glass micropipette (Figure 3A-a and 4A-a).\n\t\tNOTE: Hindbrain transection is the method that is used here for humane animal sacrifice. However, depending on the experimental goals (e.g., the study of fictive swimming), another method may be needed.\nBefore attaching the tail to the chamber, remove the skin from the trunk.",
    "Use a fresh glass micropipette (Figure 2B, bottom) to superficially cut the skin several times at a position caudal to the hindbrain (Figure 3A-b and 4A-b). Pierce the skin superficially by moving the pipette perpendicular to the rostro-caudal axis on each side of the trunk for dorsally mounted (Figure 3A-b) specimens or on the exposed side of the trunk for laterally mounted specimens (Figure 4A-b).\nTo create a flap of skin for tweezers to grab, scrape the skin several times with the micropipette at the level of and perpendicularly to the initial cut in step 3.1.10.1 (Figure 3A-c and 4A-c).\nUsing tweezers, gradually lift the skin flap and pull the skin caudally.\n\t\tNOTE: This often results in the removal of the entirety of the skin from the trunk. However, it is sometimes necessary to remove the skin in several sections by performing reiterated scraping and pulling of the skin. For some applications, partial removal of the skin may allow sufficient access to the spinal cord segments of interest (Figures 3B and 4B).\nDeliver a small drop of glue near the tail of the embryo/larva. Use this glue to attach the tail to the bottom of the dissection chamber. During this step, as the glue hardens, adjust the position of the trunk with the dissecting pin tool to ensure that the trunk remains dorsally oriented and that it is firmly attached to the chamber.\nFollowing this initial dissection, rinse the preparation extensively with Ringer's solution to remove tricaine and debris. Allow the preparation to rest for ~5 min.\nReplace the dissection solution with extracellular recording solution. If needed, add an immobilizing agent to the preparation (e.g., α-bungarotoxin [final concentration of 1 µM]).",
    "NOTE: 1 µM α-bungarotoxin immobilizes 1 to 2 dpf embryos within ~30 min. For older larvae, a higher concentration of α-bungarotoxin may be needed. α-bungarotoxin is maintained in the bath solution during recordings, which are typically performed within a period of 1 h. Recording solutions that contain divalent cations, such as cobalt, do not require the addition of an immobilizing agent. For experiments requiring prolonged recording periods (over 1 h), the preparation is perfused with bath solution at a rate of 0.5-1 mL/min.\nMove the dissection chamber with the mounted embryo to the stage of an upright compound microscope equipped with a 40X water immersion long-working-distance objective.\n\t\tNOTE: This microscope is part of the rig where recordings will be performed. The rig should also be equipped with a headstage, a patch-clamp amplifier, a micromanipulator, and a data acquisition/computer system (Figure 2C).\nMount an empty borosilicate thick-wall glass micropipette onto the electrode holder of the headstage (Figures 2B, bottom and 2C, arrow). Attach tubing (inner diameter: 0.16 cm, outer diameter: 0.32 cm, and length: ~90 cm) at one end to the air outlet of the electrode holder (arrowhead) and at the other end to a three-way stopcock (Figure 2C, black arrowhead).\n\t\t\nPlace a mouthpiece at one end of another piece of tubing (~60-70 cm in length) and attach it to the three-way stopcock at the other end (Figure 2C, black asterisk).\n\t\t\tNOTE: This tubing system allows for the application of positive and negative pressure to the inside of the recording pipette during seal formation.\nBring the micropipette tip to the most dorsal portion of the spinal cord and gently pierce the meninges. Follow with swift, short, sideways movements to loosen the meninges (Figure 3C and 3C').",
    "After the micropipette tip has traversed the meninges, advance and raise the micropipette to pull the meninges away from the spinal cord (Figure 3D and 3D').\nMove the micropipette rostrally, advancing over 1 to 2 hemisegments to expose Rohon-Beard cells (Figure 3E and 3E').\n\t\tNOTE: Dissect the minimal amount of meninges required to expose only a few Rohon-Beard cells. After each recording, additional dissection is performed to reveal more Rohon-Beard cells. In both embryos and larvae, Rohon-Beard neurons may occasionally burst upon contact with the patch micropipette. Other spinal cord neurons do not behave this way, suggesting that this might reflect unique properties of the Rohon-Beard cells, such as their mechanosensitivity. In support of this, several solution compositions (e.g., ionic components and osmolarity) were tested, and none have prevented this behavior of Rohon-Beard cells.\nDissection of larvae for recordings from Rohon-Beard cells\n\tNOTE: In 7 dpf larvae, muscle surrounding the dorsal spinal cord must be removed. Follow steps 3.1.1 to 3.1.15 (with a larva substituted for an embryo) before treatment with the enzyme.\n\t\nTo remove the muscle, incubate the larva with 0.05% collagenase for 1 min.\nRemove the collagenase by rinsing the preparation ~5 times with Ringer's solution. Follow with ~5 rinses of extracellular solution to completely remove the collagenase.\nCarry out the remainder of the dissection after mounting the recording chamber on the stage of the microscope of the recording rig. Attach a borosilicate thick-wall patch micropipette (Figure 2B, bottom) to the electrode holder and break the tip of the micropipette by gently brushing it against the bottom of the silicone chamber.",
    "Use the slightly broken micropipette to tease the muscle away and expose the dorsal spinal cord. To remove muscle fibers from the preparation, apply suction through the tubing attached to the electrode holder outlet. Use the micromanipulator to move the micropipette along the length of a muscle fiber while applying suction.\n\t\tNOTE: The goal is to first use the micropipette to mechanically loosen the muscle and then to suck away and remove the individual muscle fibers. Occasionally, during the removal of muscle, the micropipette becomes clogged with the suctioned tissue.\n\t\t\nTo unclog the micropipette, brush the micropipette against the bottom of the chamber, slightly breaking the tip, while blowing air through the tubing to expel the contents.\n\t\t\tNOTE: If the size of the micropipette tip becomes excessively large, a new micropipette may be needed. The size of the micropipette tip is more critical when removing the muscle layers closest to the membranes surrounding the spinal cord or meninges (small micropipette tips allow for more controlled work).\nRemove the meninges as described in steps 3.1.18-3.1.20 using a new micropipette (Figure 2B, bottom).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55507/55507fig4.jpg",
    "Figure 4: Lateral dissection of the zebrafish spinal cord. Mounting zebrafish embryos in a lateral orientation facilitates the access to motor neurons. The removal of the muscle and dissection of the meninges to expose the motor neurons is performed under an upright microscope adapted with a 40X water immersion objective (see Figure 2). (A) Motor neuron cell bodies are located ventrally and laterally within the spinal cord. Embryos are attached to the chamber so that their dorsal side faces the electrode holder. Note that the suture glue appears white once it hardens (asterisks). Once the hindbrain is transected (a), the skin is cut superficially several times at a site (b) caudal to the hindbrain using a glass micropipette. Additional superficial cuts (c), perpendicular to the first set (b), form a skin tab that tweezers can grab for the removal of the skin. (B-G) An empty glass micropipette, pulled to a short, tapered tip (Figure 2B, bottom), is attached to the electrode holder. The micropipette is maneuvered using the micromanipulator for the subsequent fine dissection and removal of muscle tissue. (B) The tip of the glass micropipette is first broken slightly by gently brushing it against the bottom of the chamber, creating a jagged end and a larger tip diameter. The micropipette is moved along the length of the muscle fibers while suction is applied. Muscle fibers are removed one layer at a time to prevent the disruption of the underlying meninges. In embryos, the most dorsal muscle layers are removed first, as these tend to be thinner. The skin is not removed from more caudal hemisegments (arrow). (C) The dorsal half of the muscle in one hemisegment has been removed (arrow). (D) Black lines demarcate a hemisegment devoid of muscle fibers, with intact meninges covering the spinal cord (asterisk).",
    "(E-E') Using a micropipette, pressure is applied to the meninges at a position slightly dorsal to motor neuron somata. Quick, short, lateral movements of the micropipette lead to the piercing of the meninges. (F-F') The micropipette is advanced ventrally, towards the ventral aspect of the hemisegment, and lifted to separate the meninges from the neuronal tissue. (G-G') Meninges are transected by moving the micropipette rostrally along the length of the hemisegment. Neurons immediately emerge from the exposed spinal cord and are now accessible to patch electrodes (arrow). Scale bars = 500 µm in (A); Scale bars = 100 µm in B-G (shown in Panel B).",
    "Dissection of embryos for motor neuron and interneuron recordings\nPlace the embryo in a dissection chamber containing Ringer's solution and immobilize the embryo with tricaine, as in step 3.1.1.\nMount the embryo laterally, with its dorsal side facing the side of the chamber that is optimal for the user (typically depends upon handedness). Follow steps 3.1.2-3.1.17 and ensure that the embryo remains flat against the silicone (Figure 4A and 4A').\nUse a borosilicate thick-wall micropipette with a tip that has been broken to ~25 µm to scrape and suction the muscle away and expose the meninges, as described in steps 3.2.4-3.2.4.1 (Figure 4B-4D).\nOnce the muscle layers are removed from the hemisegment(s) of interest (Figure 4D), replace the glass micropipette with a new one that has an intact tip (Figure 2B, bottom). Puncture the meninges at a position that is dorsal to the target neurons. Using the micromanipulator, push the micropipette down onto the meninges and then move it swiftly sideways to tear and traverse the meninges (Figure 4E and 4E').\nUpon rupturing the meninges, advance and raise the micropipette to lift the meninges away from the spinal cord (Figure 4F and 4F'). Move the micropipette rostrally to tear the membrane along the length of the hemisegment (Figure 4G and 4G').\n\t\tNOTE: For recordings from Rohon-Beard cells and primary motor neurons, dissection is limited to clearing the meninges away from the immediate target region. In contrast, for recordings from interneurons and secondary motor neurons, it is necessary to remove neurons within the spinal cord that hinder access to the cell of interest. In the latter case, due to the extensive disruption of spinal cord circuitry, studies are limited to the analysis of intrinsic electrical membrane properties.\n4. Electrophysiological Recordings from Spinal Neurons",
    "For recordings from Rohon-Beard cells and motor neurons, use borosilicate thick-wall glass capillaries pulled to a resistance of ~3 MΩ when filled with the pipette solution (Figure 2B, bottom).\nApply positive pressure by blowing gently through the tubing attached to the electrode holder prior to immersing the micropipette in the bath.\n\t\tNOTE: The positive pressure prevents debris from clogging the micropipette tip and is maintained by turning the three-way stopcock to the off position. Once near the target neuron, the positive pressure will result in a distinctive indentation of the cell membrane, a helpful indicator that the micropipette is close enough to initiate seal formation.\nRelease the positive pressure by turning the stopcock valve to the open position while applying additional light suction through the mouthpiece.\nAfter the formation of a GΩ-seal between the cell membrane and the micropipette tip, apply brief pulses of suction to rupture the membrane and achieve a whole-cell configuration.\nAfter establishing a stable whole-cell configuration, with an input resistance 500 MΩ and an access resistance 10 MΩ, obtain recordings in either voltage- or current-clamp mode.\nSubscription Required.
