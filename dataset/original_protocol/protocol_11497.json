    "This protocol has been performed with approval from our institutional review board with appropriate de-identification of all patient data and in accordance to all institutional, national, and international guidelines for human welfare. Obtain all appropriate institutional review board approval and informed consent from the patient's family prior to working with this protocol.\n1. Obtaining Tissue Samples\nNOTE: A critical component of this protocol requires proper handling of the tissue donation starting immediately at the time of autopsy. The overall sample viability depends significantly on minimizing the Post-Mortem Interval (PMI), immediately transferring the tissue into the appropriate cold medium supplemented with antibiotics/antimycotics, keeping the sample on wet ice throughout transportation, and maintaining sterile technique throughout the protocol.\nUpon notification of an imminent donation, prepare a sample collection kit. Using a shipping box with an insulated container that can be directly used for return transportation of the tissue sample, include the following materials:\n\t\nInclude materials for sterile preparation, including sterile gloves, drapes, and scalpels.\nInclude 8 - 10 sterile 50 mL conical tubes containing 30 mL shipping media in the insulated container with ice or cold packs.\n\t\tNOTE: While any standard cell culture media can work, the best sample viability is obtained with Hibernate-A supplemented with antibiotic/antimycotic.\nInclude any further sample tubes for other analyses (e.g., fixatives).\nIf the autopsy will not be performed at the investigator's site, include a document that clearly states how to collect the tumor sample. This includes details such as maintaining sterility, keeping sample tubes on wet ice, and including samples from the midbrain and medulla as tumor cells often invade these regions.\nMaintain sterility during the autopsy. Consider the brain sterile inside the cranium, so observe sterile technique (including changing gloves) once the cranium is open. Avoiding contamination with skin and hair is critical.",
    "Dissect the tumor from the ventral side (the \"belly\" of the pons, see Supplemental Figure 1). With a sterile scalpel, cut small 1 cm chunks from the tumor and immediately transfer into cold shipping media (see NOTE in step 1.1.2) and put on wet ice. Place 10 mL of tissue into each tube, resulting in a final volume of tissue and media in each tube of 40 mL.\n\tNOTE: In the case of DIPG, the tumor diffusely infiltrates the pons and frequently the rest of the brainstem. As such, collect as much of the sample as possible, typically including 3 - 4 tubes (30 - 40 mL tissue) from pons and 1 - 2 tubes (10 - 20 mL tissue) each from midbrain and medulla.\nCollect samples from the midbrain and medulla juxtaposed to the pons, which often contain many tumor cells.\nAfter sample collection, ship the samples O/N on wet ice in the insulated container. Do not ship the sample on dry ice, as freezing will kill the cells.\n2. Preparation for Sample Processing\nPrior to beginning sample preparation, sterilize tissue culture hoods along with razor blades, curved hemostats, and any other non-sterile tools under UV light for 1 h. Perform all of the following steps under sterile conditions to prevent contamination of the cultures.\nPrepare and sterile filter solutions.\n\t\nTo prepare 1.8 M sucrose solution, dissolve 308.07 g sucrose in 300 mL distilled water. Add 50 mL 10x Hank's-buffered Saline Solution (HBSS) without calcium or magnesium and bring total volume to 500 mL using distilled water. Store at 4 °C.",
    "To prepare enzymatic digestion solution, take 50 mL HBSS with calcium and magnesium for every 10 mL of minced tissue and add 500 μL 5 mg/mL deoxyribonuclease I (final concentration 50 μg/mL), 500 μL 2.5 mg/mL collagenase I/II and dispase solution (final concentration 25 μg/mL), and 500 μL 1 M HEPES buffer. Prewarm digestion solution in a 37 °C water bath.\nTo prepare tumor stem media (TSM) base, mix 250 mL Neurobasal-A, 250 mL Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium: Nutrient Mixture F12 (DMEM/F12), 5 mL 100x antibiotic-antimycotic, 5 mL 200 mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine dipeptide (GlutaMAX-A), 5 mL HEPES buffer, 5 mL 100 mM sodium pyruvate, and 5 mL 100x MEM non-essential amino acids.\nTo prepare complete TSM with growth factors, add the following supplements to TSM base: 50x B27 Supplement Minus Vitamin A (1:50), human Epidermal Growth Factor (H-EGF, 20 ng/mL), human Fibroblast Growth Factor (H-FGF, 20 ng/mL), human Platelet-derived Growth Factor AA (H-PDGF-AA, 10 ng/mL), human Platelet-derived Growth Factor BB (H-PDGF-BB, 10 ng/mL), and heparin solution (2 μg/mL).\nPrecool a laboratory centrifuge equipped with a swinging-bucket rotor to 4 °C.\n3. Mechanical Dissociation\nTransfer the tissue into a high-walled 100 mm x 20 mm cell culture dish. Remove media leftover from shipping and replace with 10 - 15 mL cold culture media.\nUsing the curved hemostats to grasp a razor blade, mince the tissue finely while removing obvious blood vessels or meninges.\n\tNOTE: The final tissue fragments should be smaller than 1 mm (see Figure 1B).\nTransfer the tissue into a clean 50 mL conical tube. Wash the cell culture dish with an additional 5 mL cold culture media and transfer to the conical tube. Repeat this wash step as necessary to transfer remaining tissue.",
    "Using a 10 mL serological pipet, triturate gently (4 - 5 times). Allow larger tissue fragments to settle to the bottom of the tube. If necessary, briefly centrifuge the sample for 1 min (350 x g, 4 °C).\nCollect the mechanically dissociated fraction.\n\t\nRemove the supernatant and filter it through a 100 μm filter into a new 50 mL conical tube labeled \"Mechanical Dissociation.\" Invert the filter over the original conical tube and wash with culture media to recover tissue fragments.\nCentrifuge the \"Mechanical Dissociation\" fraction for 5 min (350 x g, 4 °C).\nRemove the supernatant from the pelleted \"Mechanical Dissociation\" fraction and resuspend the tissue in cold culture media. If there is more than 5 mL of tissue in the \"Mechanical Dissociation\" conical tube, split the tissue into other 50 mL conical tubes such that no tube has more than 5 mL tissue.\nStore the mechanically dissociated fraction on ice until the sucrose gradient centrifugation step (Step 5). Alternatively, the mechanically dissociated fraction can proceed to Step 5 during the enzymatic dissociation incubation period (Step 4.4).\n4. Enzymatic Dissociation\nIf there is more than 5 mL of tissue in the tube containing the remaining larger tissue fragments, split the tissue into other new 50 mL conical tubes such that no tube has more than 5 mL tissue.\nCentrifuge the conical tube(s) containing the remaining tissue fragments for 5 min (350 x g, 4 °C).\nRemove the supernatant and add the prewarmed enzymatic digestion solution, such that there is 5 mL digestion solution for every 1 mL tissue (e.g., 25 mL digestion solution for 5 mL tissue).\nSeal the conical tube lids with laboratory film and incubate the reaction on a rotator at 37 °C for 30 min.\nAfter the incubation, triturate the samples gently (see Figure 1C).",
    "Using a 10 mL serological pipet, pipet the sample up and down 6 - 8 times. Avoid generating excessive air bubbles.\nAdd a 1,000 μL pipet tip to the end of the pipet and triturate an additional 6 - 8 times.\nAllow any remaining chunks to settle to the bottom of the tube. Remove and filter the supernatant with the cells still suspended through a 100 μm filter into a new 50 mL conical tube labeled \"Enzymatic Dissociation\" and store on ice.\nIf significant tissue fragments remain, add an additional 10 mL HBSS with calcium and magnesium to the fragments and repeat steps 3.5.1 and 3.5.2. Filter this final solution through a 100 μm filter into the \"Enzymatic Dissociation\" tube.\nCentrifuge the \"Enzymatic Dissociation\" tube for 5 min (350 x g, 4 °C) and continue to sucrose gradient centrifugation.\n5. Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation\nIf samples are still suspended in solution, centrifuge for 5 min (350 x g, 4 °C).\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend tissue in 20 mL cold HBSS without calcium and magnesium. Bring volume up to 25 mL total with cold HBSS.\nSlowly add 25 mL 1.8 M sucrose solution and invert the tube to mix. This results in a 0.9 M sucrose gradient.\nCentrifuge with no brake for 10 min (800 x g, 4 °C). Using a centrifugation brake will disrupt the gradient and reduce yield (see Figure 1D for an example of a sample before and after centrifugation).\nCarefully aspirate myelin debris and as much sucrose solution as possible. Wash the sample by adding 30 mL cold HBSS without calcium and magnesium and mixing gently. Centrifuge for 5 min (350 x g, 4 °C).\n6. ACK Red Blood Cell Lysis",
    "Remove the wash supernatant. Add 5 mL ACK lysis buffer and gently resuspend the cell pellet, swirling the tube for 1 min at RT.\nQuench the lysis by adding 30 mL cold HBSS without calcium and magnesium.\nCentrifuge for 5 min (350 x g, 4 °C).\n7. Initial Culture Maintenance\nResuspend the final cell pellets in 10 - 15 mL warm complete TSM with growth factors and quantify viable cell density on a hemocytometer using trypan blue exclusion.\n\tNOTE: The range of viable cells varies widely depending on the circumstances of the tissue donation, and quantification can be difficult at this early stage due to leftover cellular debris. In an ideal case, aim to have one million live cells per sample. In cases where excessive debris remains, plate at a lower density in a T175 flask.\nTransfer the final cell suspensions to a new T75 culture flask. Spike in additional growth factors every other day to maintain overall growth factor levels, and monitor for development of tumor cell neurospheres (see Figure 1E and Figure 2).\nAlternatively, process enzymatically dissociated cells for further analysis, including flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting.\nAfter the development of neurospheres (which on average takes 3 - 4 weeks, but ranges from a few days to as long as 2 months), reverse filter the sample using a 100 μm nylon mesh filter to reduce the amount of debris.\n\tNOTE: The filtrate should be maintained in culture in case viable single cells or small spheres are present.\nEnsure the integrity and purity of the culture by performing DNA fingerprinting while passaging, comparing to the initial patient sample."
