    "All experiments were approved by and conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the Zhejiang University Animal Experimentation Committee and were in complete compliance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Efforts were made to minimize any pain or discomfort, and the minimum number of animals was used.\n1. OGD of Corticostriatal Slices\nSolution preparation:\nPrepare 1,000 mL r-ACSF (124 mmol/L, NaCl, 5 mmol/L KCl, 1.25 mmol/L KH2PO4, 2 mmol/L MgSO4, 26 mmol/L NaHCO3, 2 mmol/L CaCl2, 10 mmol/L glucose, final pH 7.4). Bubble with 5% CO2 and 95% O2 throughout the experiment.\nPrepare 200 mL glucose-free ACSF (gf-ACSF) as above but excluding glucose, bubbled with 5% CO2 and 95% N2. Bubble the gases for 30 min before applying to brain slices to reduce the oxygen content in the solution. Continue bubbling until the OGD procedure is finished.\nPrepare acidic ACSF (a-ACSF) by equilibrating 200 mL r-ACSF with 20% CO2 and 80% O2. Bubble the gases for 30 min before applying to brain slices to reduce the pH of the solution to pH 6.8, and continue bubbling until APC procedure is finished.\nPlace three tissue holders into r-ACSF, gf-ACSF, a-ACSF, respectively.\nBrain slice preparation:\n\tNote: 8-week-old, male C57Bl/6J mice were used in this study. The animals were housed under controlled temperature (22 ± 2 °C), with a 12 h light-dark cycle period and access to pelleted food and water.\n\t\nSacrifice a mouse with an isoflurane overdose in an induction chamber. Decapitate the mouse. Dissect out the brain using small scissors and forceps. Remove the brain with a thin spatula and drop it carefully into a glass beaker containing ice-cold r-ACSF equilibrated with 5% CO2 and 95% O2.\n\t\tNOTE: These steps should be done as quickly but meticulously as possible.",
    "Keep the brain in the ice-cold r-ACSF for 5 min. Adjust the gas pressure to avoid movements of the brain.\nPlace cryoprecipitate glue on the vibratome plate in two strips. Put a piece of 3% agarose upon the glue strip away from the blade to support the brain.\nInvert a 10-cm Petri dish on ice and then put a filter paper on the dish. Moisten the filter paper with drops of ice-cold r-ACSF.\nTransfer the brain to the filter paper with forceps. Cut off the frontal pole and the cerebellum with blade and forceps.\n\t\tNOTE: The transverse sections should be as smooth as possible and vertical to sagittal plane.\nPlace the remaining brain tissue vertically upon the other strip of glue and keep the brain leaning against the agarose. Add ice-cold r-ACSF to the cutting reservoir to submerge the brain and add ice to the ice holder area. Keep the r-ACSF in the reservoir bubbled with 5% CO2 and 95% O2.\nRaise the reservoir and adjust the position of the razor to place the razor as close to the brain as possible and just above the brain.\nChoose \"CONT\" mode to slice the brain sections continuously. Set the cutting thickness to 400 µm, vibrating frequency to 6 - 8, and speed to 3 - 4. Press the \"start/stop\" button to start automatic cutting.\nCut off the tip of a 3 mL Pasteur pipette to make an opening matching the size of the brain slices.\n\t\tNOTE: The opening should be large enough to avoid additional damage to the brain slices.",
    "Draw out five brain slices one by one with the tip-cutPasteur pipette and place them into the tissue holder in ice-cold r-ACSF bubbled with 5% CO2 and 95% O2. Do not collect the first slice produced. Adjust the gas pressure to avoid movements of the brain slices.\n\t\tNOTE: The brain slices should not cover each other.\nPlace brain slices with r-ACSF at room temperature for 30 min and then at 37 °C in a water bath for another 10 min to recover synaptic functions.\nOGD and APC:\nPlace gf-ACSF and a-ACSF into a 37 °C water bath and bubble the buffers with the corresponding gases as mentioned above in 1.1.2 and 1.1.3 for 30 min.\nLeave one slice in r-ACSF as a control. Transfer the other four brain slices into the tissue holder with preheated gf-ACSF carefully and incubate for 15 min. Transfer the slices back into the tissue holder in r-ACSF to achieve reperfusion.\nTo study the time window of APC, transfer one slice directly from gf-ACSF to a-ACSF. Transfer the other three slices to r-ACSF at first, and then transfer two of them to the tissue holder in a-ACSF 5 and 15 min after reperfusion respectively.\nIncubate the two slices in a-ACSF for 3 min and then transfer them back to r-ACSF. Incubate the three slices in r-ACSF for another 1 h. Set the remaining slices in r-ACSF as the OGD group.",
    "For a dose response study, transfer all four slices to the tissue holder in r-ACSF at first after OGD and incubate for 5 min. Then leave one slice in r-ACSF as the OGD group and transfer the other three slices to a-ACSF. Incubate the slices in a-ACSF for 1, 3 and 5 min respectively and then transfer them back to r-ACSF. Incubate the three slices in r-ACSF for another 1 h.\nSlice viability determination:\nPrepare 0.25% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium hydrochloride (TTC) normal saline solution. Add 1.25 g TTC powder to 500 mL normal saline solution.\n\t\tNOTE: After the powder completely dissolves, transfer the solution into a 24-well plate (500 µL per well) covered in foil and store it at 4 °C. TTC and tissue stained with TTC are light sensitive.\nTransfer the slices into a 24-well plate (one slice per well) containing TTC solution and stretch out the slice in the solution. Incubate the slices in TTC solution at 37 °C in a shallow water bath for 30 min.\nTransfer the slices into clean 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes covered in foil and measure the dry weight of the slices.\nAdd ethanol/dimethyl sulfoxide (1:1) into the centrifuge tubes (v:w = 10:1) to extract formazan. Incubate the slices in ethanol/dimethyl sulfoxide at room temperature away from light for 24 h.\nAdd all ethanol/dimethyl sulfoxide in the tubes into a 96-well plate and measure the absorbance at 490 nm by a plate reader.\nNormalize the absorbance to the dry weight of the slice and express viability as the percentage of control slice.\n2. MCAO\nPreparation:\nDisinfect the workbench, the surface of the Laser Doppler Flowmetry (LDF) instrument and its accessories with 70% ethyl alcohol.",
    "Prepare autoclaved instruments: two scissors, 10 cm; two forceps, 10 cm; one ophthalmic forceps, 11 cm; one micro ophthalmic scissors, 9 cm; one microvessel clamp, 1.8 cm; oneneedle drive,r 12.5 cm; several surgical sutures (△ 1/2 4 × 10); cotton swabs.\nPrepare a syringe (without needle) with saline solution to maintain a hydrated operation area.\nPrepare the anesthesia gas (100% O2 + isoflurane).\nDetection of brain blood flow:\nSet up the LDF instrument.\nInject analgesics intraperitoneally into the mouse: metamizol 200 mg/kg, carprofen 4 mg/kg and buprenorphin 0.1 mg/kg.\nPlace the mouse into an induction chamber with 4% isoflurane in oxygen to anesthetize it until spontaneous movement of body and vibrissae stops.\nPlace the mouse in a prone position with its nose fitted into the nose cone and maintain isoflurane at 1.5% for the subsequent procedure.\nApply dexpanthenol eye ointment on both eyes.\nDisinfect the head with 70% ethyl alcohol.\nMake a right paramedian skin incision between eyes and ears using a scalpel to expose the bregma.\nRub the skull with sterile cotton.\nApply one to two drops of surgical glue to the surface of the skull.\nPlace the tip of fiber optic probe 5 mm caudal to the bregma and 6 mm lateral to the midline.\nStart recording the blood flow on the computer software. Wait until a stable blood flow baseline occurs and then apply a 20 µL catalyst upon the glue to fix the probe.\n\t\tNOTE: An ideal baseline should be more than 500 flux.\nIf the baseline is less than 200 flux, adjust the position finely to get a suitable baseline. Keep the probe attached to the skull for the duration of the experiment.\nDisinfect the head with iodophor after the fiber optic probe attached.\nMCAO:",
    "Place and fix the anesthetized mouse (with LDF probe attached to its skull) in a supine position and maintain its body temperature using a heat lamp throughout the surgery. Disinfect the neck with 70% ethyl alcohol.\nMake a paramedian skin incision in the neck using a scalpel; blunt dissect the soft tissues with forceps to expose vessels. Add one drop of saline to the exposed tissues to keep themhydrated.\nDissect the common carotid artery from surrounding tissue and the vagus nerve using ophthalmic forceps. Be careful not to damage the vagus nerve. Disinfect skin of neck again with iodophor after the common carotid artery exposed.\nPlace a microvessel clamp at distal end of the common carotid artery and then tie a dead knot with 6-0 silk sutures at the proximal end. Place the clamp as proximal as possible for subsequent operations. Ensure that the length of the vessel between the clamp and dead knot is as long as possible for subsequent operations.\nMake a temporary suture proximal to the clamp by tying a loose knot. Ensure that there is enough space between two knots for monofilament insertion.\nMake a smalllongitudinal incision between the two knots with micro ophthalmic scissors. Ensure the incision is as close to the dead knot as possible for subsequent operations. Be careful not to cut off the vessel.\nInsert a 12-mm tip-blunted monofilamentthrough the incision to enter the artery lumen and advance it a few mm. Tighten the loose knot around the tip of the monofilament and then remove the clamp.\nAdvance the filament into the internal carotid artery (10 mm to occlude the middle cerebral artery) with ophthalmic forceps until the LDF software shows a sharp decline (>80% reduction from baseline blood flow) in blood flow. Record the start time of occlusion.",
    "NOTE: LDF instrument setup is described in section 2.2.\nOcclude the middle cerebral artery for 1 h. Cut off the LDF probe and put the mice in a 30 °C incubator for the duration of occlusion.\nReperfusion and APC:\nRe-anesthetize the animals with isoflurane as described above 55 min after the beginning time of occlusion. Place and fix mice in a supine position. Open the neck incision and re-expose the common carotid artery.\nGently pull out the filament with ophthalmic forceps after occlusion period to achieve reperfusion and turn the temporary suture into a permanent one by tightening the knot.\nFor acidosis treatment, change the gas inhaled by the nose cone to the mix gases containing 20% CO2, 20% O2 and 60% N2 for 5 min at 5, 50, or 100 min after reperfusion. Close the incision with an interrupted surgical suture.\nPlace mice in a 30 °C heat cage until mice recover consciousness and then return the mice to clean, individual cages. Provide mice with a Petri dish of water and moistened food. Monitor the mice closely after the surgery for excessive pain and death.\nBrain Infarct volume measurement:\nMeasure brain infarct volume by usingTTC staining 24 h after reperfusion.\nPrepare 0.25% TTC solution as mentioned in step 1.4.1 prior to the designated time of sacrifice. Transfer the solution into a 24-well plate (1 mL per well) covered in foil and store it at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: TTC and tissue stained with TTC are light sensitive.\nAt 24 h after reperfusion, sacrifice the animal with an isoflurane overdose in an induction chamber. Decapitate the mice. Dissect out the brains using small scissors and forceps. Examine blooding points on the brains to exclude the mice that underwent subarachnoid hemorrhage at the Circle of Willis.",
    "Place the brain on a clean glass slide on a -20 °C ice pack. Place the brain and the glass slide in a -20 °C fridge for 5 min to make the brain easier to slice.\nTake out the brain and the glass slide from -20 °C and put them back on the -20 °C ice pack. Dissect the frontal pole and the cerebellum with blade and forceps.\nSlice the brain sections horizontally to a 1-mm thickness with a blade to produce 5 slices. Transfer the slices into the 24-well plate containing TTC solution (1 slice per well) with forceps and stretch out the slices in the solution. Incubate the slices in TTC solution at 37 °C in a shallow water bath for 30 min.\nAspirate the TTC solution. Add 10% formaldehyde (1 mL per well) and incubate at room temperature for 30 min. Place the slices in the order in which they were cut upon a cellophane sheet and scan the segments into the photographic plate imager.\nAnalyze the infarct size as a percentage of the whole brain slice using ImageJ analysis software8based on visual identification; see Figure 2 (left).\nSubscription Required.
