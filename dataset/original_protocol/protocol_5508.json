    "Gelatin embeddingWash 4% PFA/0.1 M PB (see Recipes), perfused, 72 h post-fixed brains, once with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) (see Recipes) and immerse brain in 30% sucrose/0.1 M PB (see Recipes) in a 50 ml conical tube. Use magnetic stir-bar atop a 15 ml inverted conical tube cap to help keep brain submerged in the tube. Incubate at 4 °C overnight (18 h).Decant 30% sucrose/0.1 M PB and replace with 50 °C double distilled water (ddH2O) and put tubes containing brains in a 55 °C incubator for 45 min to equilibrate the temperature of the brains. Continue to use magnetic stir-bar and conical cap to submerge brain for all subsequent steps between 50-55 °C.While brains are being temperature equilibrated, pre-warm hot plate for gelatin preparation, make sure temperature of the hot plate does not exceed 60 °C. Make 14% gelatin/10% sucrose solution (25 ml/brain); for 500 ml (20 brains), add 70 g gelatin little by little to 450 ml of 50 °C ddH2O using magnetic stir bar speed from slow to fast, which will pull in gelatin without causing clumps (Video 1).Once the gelatin is dissolved, add 50 g of sucrose and bring volume to 500 ml with 50 °C ddH2O. Make 7% gelatin/5% sucrose solution by pre-warming 150 ml of ddH2O to 55 °C and add 150 ml of 14% gelatin/10% sucrose to the pre-warmed ddH2O, keep all gelatin solutions at 55 °C in oven (Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1.

Mark weigh boats with animal ID numbers. Using a spoon spatula, work swiftly and carefully dislodge brain and liquid contents into a weigh boat atop a large Petri dish on a bed of ice. Top off with gelatin, remove bubbles, orient the brain and gently press down with bent forceps to keep it submerged until the bottom begins to set (about 7-10 min, Video 3).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 3. Casting of gelatin embedded brain and removal after gelatin setting. Visual demonstration of casting gelatin embedded brain in weigh boat mold and subsequent cutting of set mold from weigh boat are shown in this example.Move brains to a 4 °C refrigerator and leave for another 90 min.Mark sample vials with animal ID numbers.Carefully cut out the casted brain with a new single edge razor blade and slide into sample vial.Add 4% PFA/10% sucrose in 0.1 M PB (see Recipes) to the vial with brain, place the vial in a refrigerator overnight (18 h).Remove PFA, rinse once with 0.05 M PB (see Recipes) and replace with 30% sucrose/0.05 M PB (see Recipes). Keep sample vials in the refrigerator for a minimum of 72 h.Sequential slice collectionAfter embedding, mark 3 to 4 vials for each animal. (i.e., animal ID–#1 to 3 or 4)Cut block that includes the region of interest, trim block and systematically cut diagonal corners to orient the slices correctly during mounting (i.e., upper right and lower left corners relative to the face of the block).Collect sections from microtome or vibratome in 0.",
    "05 M PB and place sections sequentially among the 3 to 4 vials. Loop back to the first vial after the third or fourth vial (Figure 1). Sections between 40-80 μm from the vibratome generally work the best.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171114/20171114192034_0355.jpgFigure 1. Slice collection schematic from sectioning device and post-immunostaining arrangement of slices at the mounting step. Slices are collected sequentially in numbered vials as shown in the figure. After the completion of immunostaining procedure, each of the vial’s slices is arranged in columns in a large Petri dish, with the next vial’s column arranged beside the previous vial. Once arranged, serial mounting is achieved by moving along row by row. Arrangement by sequential vial collection is simpler since the distance between slices is greater. This allows for slices to be easily distinguished from one another more accurately and thus, mounting is performed more rapidly.ImmunostainingUsers’ choice: fluorescent labeling or IHC. Briefly, the examples shown in Figures 2 and 3 were stained by the following procedures.Pretreat the samples with 3% H2O2 in 0.05 M PB for 20 min, and then incubate the samples with blocking solution (see Recipes) for 1 h.Decant the blocking solution and add primaries in antibody solution (see Recipes, 1:100 [anti-ChAT]; 1:1,000 [anti-TH], 1:1,000 [anti-NeuN]), incubate at 4 °C for 48 h.Decant the primaries. Wash with PBS for 5 min, 3 times.Add biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies in antibody solution (1:400 anti-goat, ChAT, anti-rabbit for TH and anti-mouse for NeuN), incubate at 25 °C for 4 h.Decant the secondaries. Wash with PBS for 5 min, 3 times.Add Standard ABC Peroxidase solution diluted according to manufacturer’s protocol in PBS and 0.2% Tween-20, incubate at 25 °C for 4 h.Decant the ABC Peroxidase solution. Wash with PBS for 5 min, 3 times.Make DAB working solution according to the manufacturer’s protocol and add to slices.",
    "Wait approximately 3-5 min for signal development and stop reaction with four 0.1 M PB washes.Decant ABC peroxidase solution and wash with PBS for 5 min, 3 times. Store slices in 0.05 M PB.Serial mounting after immunostainingDump contents of first vial into large Petri dish with 0.01 M PB (1:5 dilution of 0.05 M PB in H2O) and arrange in a column using a fine paintbrush.Carefully move contents of second vial and arrange in column next to first vial’s column.Repeat until all vials are arranged in columns next to one another.Mount adjacent serial slices on slides with a paintbrush, moving along row by row (Figures 1 and 2).If dry mounting IHC slices, prepare slide by coating with 0.12% w/v gelatin in ddH2O (dilute 1:4 0.5% w/v gelatin in ddH2O, see Recipes) with a paintbrush in a medium sized weigh boat. Leave slide half submerged by resting the frosted side on the square edge of the weigh boat and the submerged side on the bottom slope of the spout (Video 4).Move initial slices from large Petri dish to submerged slide in medium-sized weigh boat containing 0.12% gelatin by placing slice in the solution, orienting the slice and then carefully sliding the slice up to its proper position away from the submerged edge of the slide. Push the slide towards the spout of the weigh boat, exposing more of the slide from the 0.12% gelatin and repeating the process in step D6 for the adjacent slices to fill the rest of the slide. Blot dry edge of slide on Kimwipe and air dry for 24 h at 22 °C before counterstaining, dehydration, mounting medium and cover slip placement.    <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p>   Video 4.

Cannula placement localized in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) using serial sections. Gelatin embedded rat brain slices were stained with anti-tyrosine hydroxylase visualized with horseradish peroxidase and 3’,3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB). Slices were dry mounted onto a slide, counterstained with 0.02% thionin for 3 minutes, run through an ethanol dehydration series and cover-slipped with Entellan mounting medium. Six 80 μm serial slices were mounted sequentially starting from top left moving along horizontally ending on the bottom right and the vial and slice number are labeled above the slice (see Figure 1 for origin of vial and slice)."
