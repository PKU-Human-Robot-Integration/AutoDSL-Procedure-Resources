Subcutaneous injection of MOG/CFA emulsion for EAE induction, related to step 1\nSubcutaneously inject mouse with 75 μL of MOG-emulsion and carefully remove the needle (see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nRepeat at left flank.\nCritical: Successful subcutaneous injections should result in visible bolus shaped depots under the skin. No significant amount of MOG/CFA emulsion should leak after the injection.\nDraw pertussis injection solution in a 1 mL syringe.\nInject each mouse i.p. with 100 μL.\n2 days later repeat the preparation and injection of the pertussis solution.\nEAE scoring.\nStarting on day 7 post EAE induction, examine mice daily for weight loss and clinical symptoms.\nClassify clinical symptoms according to the following criteria. See Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1941_6.csv\nNote: The disease kinetics (day of onset, peak, remission phase varies between experiments, mouse strains, laboratories. However, a successful immunization regimen should result in 80%–100% disease incidence. Typically, mice start to lose weight and develop the first symptoms within 7–12 days after EAE induction (Mendel et al., 1995[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Barthelmes et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].",
    "Note: Some mice may develop skin lesions at the injection site. Small ulcers usually heal within a few days without treatment but if necessary, mice can be treated with antibiotic ointment. However, in rare cases some mice develop larger skin lesions (approximately 2 cm diameter) which are characterized by complete hair loss and redness. Mice with this type of lesion rarely develop EAE symptoms and should be excluded from the experiment.\nCritical: Provide mice with wet food and easily accessible water on the cage floor as soon as they show first signs of paralysis. If severe dehydration is observed, mice should be injected with glucose-supplemented saline or Ringer’s solution.\nCritical: Scoring should be done in a blinded manner and ideally always by the same person.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2. Overview of clinical scores in EAE bearing mice, related to step 2\nBone marrow isolation and differentiation of bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BM-DCs)\nTiming: 1–2 h Bone marrow isolation\nTiming: 7 days Differentiation\nIsolation of bones.\nHumanely euthanize mice according to ethical guidelines and spray with 70% ethanol to sterilize skin.\nNote: We usually use 8–12 week old mice for BM-DC generation.\nCut open abdominal skin with scissors and remove skin from the whole hind leg by pulling out the leg from its skin layers.\nDislocate the hip joint without breaking it, remove the whole hind-leg and place it in a falcon with fresh PBS.\nCritical: Bones should not get broken during the isolation otherwise bone marrow cells might get contaminated.\nPerform all following steps in a tissue culture-hood.\nIsolation of bone marrow cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1941-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Critical steps of bone marrow isolation and BM-DC differentiation",
    "Take hind legs out of tube and quickly dip in a falcon filled with 70% ethanol. Place bones on a sterile paper towel.\nRemove the paw and subsequently try to remove as much muscle and connective tissue as possible.\nPlace the bones in a 6-well dish filled with sterile PBS (finish bone isolation of all mice/genotypes needed for the experiment).\nPrepare 50 mL falcons and place a 70 μM cell strainer on them.\nPre-wet strainer with 2 mL of PBS.\nTake the tibia and femur with a sterile forceps and trim both ends using sterilized scissors to open up the bones.\nTake a 5 mL syringe and fill it with 5 mL sterile PBS and attach a 27-gauge needle to it.\nHold the tibia/femur over the prepared strainer, insert the needle into the narrow end of the tibia/femur.\nFlush the bone marrow onto the 70 μM strainer.\nCarefully disrupt bone marrow chunks with the tip of the serological pipet and wash the strainer with 10 mL PBS or culture medium.\nWhen no more red chunks are visible on the strainer, spin down cell suspension at 500 g for 5 min at room temperature.\nA clear red visible pellet should be visible.\nDiscard the supernatant by inverting the falcon over a waste bottle.\nResuspend cell pellet in 1 mL of erythrocyte-lysis buffer, incubate for 5 min at room temperature.\nStop erythrocyte-lysis by adding 10 mL of culture medium.\nSpin down cell suspension at 500 g for 5 min at room temperature. Pellet should be completely white. In case pellet remains red, erylysis should be repeated.\nDiscard the supernatant by inverting the falcon over a waste bottle.\nResuspend cell pellet in 10 mL of culture medium and count cells.\nStart BM-DC differentiation.",
    "Seed 5 × 106 cells in 10 mL culture medium in a 10 cm tissue-culture treated petri-dish with 20 ng/mL GM-CSF and 5 ng/mL IL-4.\nPut dishes in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator.\nDay 3: Add 5 mL of fresh culture media with 20 ng/mL GM-CSF and 5 ng/mL IL-4. Total volume of culture media is then 15 mL.\nOptional: BM-DC generation also works from frozen bone-marrow, however in our experience the yield of fully-differentiated BM-DCs is decreased.\nHarvest of fully differentiated BM-DCs and antigen loading\nTiming: 5–6 h\nDay 6–7: Harvest fully differentiated BM-DCs (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).\nCheck cell morphology and confluency under the microscope (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1941-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Quality control of antigen-loaded BM-DCs\n(A and B) Morphology of BM-DC cultures during differentiation (A) and quality control of MOG35–55 loaded BM-DCs by flow cytometry (B). Scale bars = 500 μM, cells are gated for viable CD11c+ DCs and further assessed for their CD80, CD86, MHC-II, and MHC-I surface expression.\nCarefully remove 6 mL of media directly from surface.\nWith the remaining media detach loosely attached cells by pipetting over the dish several times.\nCritical: Post differentiation, do not use highly adherent cells as most of these cells do not represent mature BM-DCs (Helft et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nTransfer cell suspension in a 15 mL falcon and count cells.\nAntigen loading of BM-DCs.\nSpin down cell suspension at 500 g for 5 min at room temperature and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend 2 × 106 cells in 2 mL culture medium per well and plate in a 6 well plate.\nImmediately add 10 μg/mL MOG35–55 (freshly thawed aliquot).\nNote: Always plate a little more BM-DCs than needed. Not all cells can be recovered after scraping and additional suspension is needed for the dead volume of the syringe and BM-DC quality control.",
    "Incubate cells for 5–6 h in a 37°C, 5%CO2 incubator.\nTransfer of antigen-loaded DCs and quality control\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step describes adoptive transfer of antigen loaded bone-marrow derived dendritic cells and their quality control. The quantity of cell transfers and the exact timing might be adapted depending on the biological question.\nHarvest of MOG-loaded BM-DCs.\nVisually check cells (upon antigen loading DCs usually loosely attach to the dish) under the microscope.\nGently detach DCs by using a cell scraper.\nTransfer cell suspension into a 15 mL falcon.\nDetermine cell number.\nSpin down cell suspension at 500 g for 5 min at room temperature and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend cells in sterile PBS at a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/mL. You will require 50 μL per mouse plus 100 μL excess volume if syringes with dead-volume are used.\nTransfer cell suspension in an Eppendorf tube (2 mL or 5 mL) and store cells on ice until injections. Injections should be performed immediately.\nKeep a cell aliquot for the quality control (step 12).\nTransfer of cells.\nRandomize mice across experimental groups/conditions.\nAnaesthetize mice with isoflurane (2%–4% under constant oxygen flow).\nDraw BM-DC cell suspension into a 1 mL syringe and mount a 27G needle.\nIntravenously inject each mouse with 50 μL of the DC cell suspension via the retro-orbital sinusoid.\nCritical: Injections should be performed as quick as possible to ensure an evenly suspended cell injection solution.\nNote: The BM-DC transfer is also compatible with the use of in vivo blocking antibodies such as anti-PD-1. We usually inject blocking antibodies i.p. 2–4 h before mice receive the cell transfer.
