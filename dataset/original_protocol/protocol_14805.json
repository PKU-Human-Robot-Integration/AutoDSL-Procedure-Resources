    "NOTE: The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science. All procedures were in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Research Council.\n1. Experimental Setup and Anesthesia\nPerform calibrations of the various signals to be captured using a data acquisition system (pressures, temperature, piston displacement, electrocardiogram [ECG], capnography, etc.).\nSterilize instruments and catheters (e.g., in an autoclave for instruments and ethylene oxide sterilizer for catheters) and operate gowned and wearing a mask, cap, and sterile gloves if the experiment involves survival surgery. Clean surgical instruments and catheters but there is no need to be sterile for non-survival surgery.\nPrepare the catheters described below and depicted in Figure 1 for a rat weighing between 0.45 kg and 0.55 kg.\n\t\nMark a 2F T-type thermocouple catheter, size 0.6 mm OD (2F), at 3, 5, and 8 cm from the tip with permanent marker, for advancement into the thoracic aorta. Use this catheter to measure temperature and cardiac output.\nCut polyethylene tubing, size 0.46 mm ID and 0.91 mm OD (PE25) ≈ 25 cm in length, one for advancement into the thoracic aortic and another for advancement into the right atrium.\nCut the end of each PE25 catheter tip to be inserted into the vessel at a 90° angle.\n\t\tNOTE: Beveled tips at 45° angle may cause vessel perforation when using PE tubing. However, the beveled tip can be trimmed down with sandpaper to reduce its sharpness.\nAttach a 26 gauge female luer stub adaptor to the proximal end of each PE25 catheter.",
    "Mark the aortic catheter at 3, 5, and 8 cm and the right atrial catheter at 3, 5, 8, 10 and 12 cm from the tip. Use the aortic catheter to measure aortic pressure and for blood sampling. Use the right atrial catheter to measure right atrial pressure.\nAttach each luer stub adaptor to a pressure transducer fitted with a 3-way stopcock.\nCut the tip of a 3F polyurethane pediatric venous catheter, size 0.6 mm ID and 1.0 mm OD (3F), at a 45° angle for advancement into the right atrium.\nMark the 3F external jugular catheter at 4 cm from the tip. Use this catheter to advance a guide wire into the right ventricle for electrical induction of VF with the subsequent option to use it for drug delivery and blood sampling. Attach a 3-way stopcock to the catheter.\n\t\tNOTE: Marks made on the catheters are for the surgeon’s guidance as the catheters are advanced. The mark at 3 cm on the catheters advanced through the femoral vessels alerts the surgeon of an area of potential resistance resulting from the vessels beginning to curve up towards the thoracic region. The 8 cm marks on the aortic catheter and thermocouple catheter indicate the tip is in the descending thoracic aorta. The 12 cm mark on the right atrial catheter indicates the tip is in the right atrium. Interim marks are guides as the catheters are advanced. The 4 cm mark on the right external jugular catheter indicates the tip is in the right atrium.\nPrime each catheter with saline containing 10 IU/ml of heparin (to ensure their patency) and turn the corresponding stopcocks to the closed position.",
    "Cut a 5F fluorinated ethylene propylene cannula, size 1.1 mm ID and 1.6 mm OD (5F) mounted on a stylette, to be ≈ 8 cm in length creating a blunted tip. Use this cannula for advancement into the trachea placing its tip ≈ 2 cm from the carina for positive pressure ventilation during and after cardiac resuscitation.\n\t\tNOTE: The metal stylette of the cannula needs to be bent at a 145° angle ≈ 3 cm from the tip to aid in advancement into the trachea.\nPrepare the rat for surgical instrumentation.\n\t\nAnesthetize the rat by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (45 mg/kg). If required, give additional doses (10 mg/kg) intravenously every 30 minutes (after establishing vascular access) to maintain a surgical plane of anesthesia.\n\t\tNOTE: Most studies have used male retired breeder Sprague-Dawley rats.\nClip the hair from the surgical areas and areas where electrical shocks will be delivered; which include the dorsal thoracic area, left and right groin, neck, and anterior surface of the thorax.\nAdminister 0.02 mg/kg (1 ml/kg) buprenorphine subcutaneously for analgesia.\nFix the rat in a supine position on a surgical board by taping the front and hind limbs at a 45° angle from the midline.\nScrub incision areas with betadine scrub followed by 70% ethanol 3 times.\nApply a thin film of antibacterial ophthalmic ointment to the corneas.\nInsert a rectal thermistor ≈ 4 cm into the rectum and secure the thermistor to the surgical board.\nMaintain core body temperature between 36.5 °C and 37.5 °C using an incandescent heating lamp throughout the experiment.\nPlace ECG needles subcutaneously on the right upper limb, left upper limb, and the right hind limb, and record the ECG throughout the experiment.\n2. Vascular Cannulations",
    "2.1) Left femoral artery for advancing the T-type thermocouple catheter into the descending thoracic aorta\nMake a 2 cm incision on the left inguinal area at a 90° angle relative to its grove.\nExpose the femoral vessels and nerve by blunt dissection of the surrounding connective tissue using a pair of hemostats.\nExpose the vascular sheath around the vessels using a curved micro dissection forceps.\n\tNOTE: Avoid puncturing either vessel or the nerve.\nTravel with micro dissection forceps underneath the femoral artery, vein, and nerve and support them at a 90° angle relative to the vessels. With both vessels and the nerve supported, begin separation of the artery from the nerve and vein by using another pair of curved micro dissection forceps.\n\tNOTE: Separation is done from underneath and parallel to the vessels to minimize risk of injury to the vessels and nerve.\nReposition the supporting forceps; releasing the nerve to support only the vein and artery.\nThread a forceps between the artery and the vein and separate them to a length of ≈ 1 cm.\nRelease the isolated vein from the supporting forceps gently, and remain supporting the artery only.\nInsert two silk 3-0 braided non-absorbable ligatures and position one distally and one proximal ≈ 1 cm apart.\nTighten firmly the distal ligature while the artery is still supported using a surgeon's knot followed by two single knots. Tighten the proximal ligature with a loose surgeon's knot.\nMake a small incision on the vessel using a pair of micro dissection scissors near the distal ligature at a 60° angle relative to the vessel cutting approximately ¼ of its the cross sectional area.\n\tNOTE: A small drop of blood emerging from the cut signals the lumen was reached.",
    "Drip heparinized saline onto the vessel to allow for smooth insertion of the catheter.\n\tNOTE: One to two drops of 1% lidocaine solution can also be used to prevent vessel spasm.\nInsert a 22 gauge needle – whose tip has been custom bent at a 70° angle and blunted using sandpaper (i.e., introducer) – into the vessel opening while gently pulling the distal ligature with the hemostats to stabilize the vessel.\nLift the introducer gently to expose the lumen and guide the T-type thermocouple catheter under the introducer, removing it once the catheter tip has been inserted.\nHold the catheter in place with one hand while accommodating the other hand in a comfortable position to advance the catheter.\nClose the supporting forceps and move them distally as the catheter is advanced.\n\tNOTE: If any resistance is met while advancing the catheter; stop, pull back and insert at an alternative angle.\nAdvance the catheter until the 8 cm mark to position its tip into the descending thoracic aorta.\nSecure the catheter to the vessel by tightening the proximal ligature and adding two additional single knots.\n\tNOTE: Secure knots tight enough to prevent bleeding around the catheter and inadvertent displacement; yet, loose enough to enable back and forth movement if required for repositioning.\nRemove the forceps and the hemostats gently.\n2.2) Left femoral vein for advancing the PE25 catheter into the right atrium\nLift the femoral artery already cannulated with the T-type thermocouple catheter by gently pulling up on the ligature and exposing the adjacent femoral vein.\nTravel under the vein using forceps and open them to prop up the vein.\nFollow steps 2.1.8 through 2.1.18 but advancing the PE25 catheter (instead of the T-type thermocouple) to the 12 cm mark to position its tip near the right atrium.",
    "Verify blood can be withdrawn through the catheter to confirm its intraluminal unobstructed position and flush the catheter with 0.2 ml of heparinized saline.\nClose the surgical incision with a single surgeon's knot.\n2.3) Right femoral artery for advancing the PE25 catheter into the descending thoracic aorta\nFollow steps 2.1.1 through 2.1.18 but advancing the PE25 catheter to the 8 cm mark to position its tip into the descending thoracic aorta.\nRepeat steps 2.2.4 and 2.2.5.\n2.4) Right external jugular vein for advancing the 3F polyurethane pediatric venous catheter into the right atrium\nMake a 1.5 cm long incision starting at the base of the neck, 1 cm to the right of trachea, ending just below the thyroid.\n\tNOTE: Avoid injuring or exposing the thyroid gland.\nGently dissect the surrounding connective tissue using a pair of hemostats to expose the external jugular vein.\nTravel under the vein using forceps and open them to prop up the vein.\nRepeat steps 2.1.8 through 2.1.18 for vein catheterization, but advancing the 3F catheter to the 4 cm mark positioning its tip in the right atrium.\nRepeat step 2.2.4.\nCap the catheter with the 3-way stopcock and turn it to the closed position.\n3. Tracheal Intubation\n3.1) Tracheal exposure\nExpand the previously performed neck incision toward the midline using hemostats.\nDissect with hemostats and forceps using blunt technique the sternohyoid, sternothyroid, and mastoid part of the cleidocephalic muscles to expose the trachea and hold it exposed using a tissue spreader.\n3.2) Tracheal intubation\nPull the tongue out to stretch the airway. Advance the 5F catheter (i.e., tracheal cannula) mounted on the stylette. Firmly hold the cannula while advancing with the tip pointing upward and advance seeking to enter the upper airway, vocal cords, and trachea.",
    "Trans-visualize the tracheal cannula as it advances for guidance into proper position.\nRemove the stylette from the cannula and attach an infrared CO2 analyzer adaptor to the distal end of the cannula.\nConfirm successful tracheal intubation by recognizing the characteristic capnographic waveform; i.e., airway CO2 increasing during expiration and decreasing during inspiration.\n4. Confirmation of Baseline Stability\nComplete the surgical instrumentation and connection of the various catheters, cannulas, and ECG leads via their corresponding transducers and signal conditioners to a data acquisition system, and confirm hemodynamic stability based on cardiac output and blood pressure meaurements and metabolic stability (advisable) by measuring blood gases and lactate levels.\n\tNOTE: Cardiac output is measured by computer analysis of the thermodilution curve recorded in the descending thoracic aorta through the thermocouple after 200 μl bolus injection of 0.9% NaCl at room temperature into the right atrium.\nDefine the specific baseline reference values for the various parameters of interest; which may vary contingent on the rat strain, gender, and weight. Baseline and post-resuscitation reference values from a representative experiment using the rat model herein described are listed on Table 1.\n5. Experimental Protocol\n5.1) Induction of ventricular fibrillation (VF)\nInsert a needle subcutaneously in the rat’s abdominal wall connected to the negative pole of a 60 Hz, alternating current (AC) generator (0 to 12 mA). Avoid advancing the needle beyond the subcutaneous tissue into the abdominal cavity to avoid inadvertent injury to internal organs.\nAttach one end of a precurved 0.38 mm OD and 40 cm long guide wire (via a wire connector) to the positive pole of the AC generator. Ensure that the polarity is not reversed; otherwise VF may not be induced.",
    "Remove the 3-way stopcock from the 3F polyurethane catheter inserted in the right external jugular vein and advance the softer tip of the guide wire approximately 7 cm seeking to enter the right ventricle while monitoring the ECG and the aortic pressure.\n\tNOTE: Correct placement of the guide wire will be suggested by ectopic ventricular beats observed in the ECG and aortic pressure.\nTurn on the 60 Hz AC generator and gradually increase the current while monitoring the aortic pressure.\n\tNOTE: A 2.0 mA current is typically sufficient to induce VF but it varies contingent on location of the guide wire relative to the right ventricle. Minor adjustments to the tip location may be required to induce VF at lower current levels.\nConfirm induction of VF by documenting (1) cessation of aortic pulsations and exponential decay of the aortic pressure to ≈ 20 mm Hg within ≈ 5 seconds and (2) appearance of unorganized electrical activity in the ECG, as shown in Figure 2.\nMaintain the current uninterruptedly for 3 minutes reducing the intensity after the first minute to approximately half the level required to induce VF.\nTurn the current off after 3 min and document that VF continues without the need to apply current.\n\tNOTE: Small hearts defibrillate spontaneously given a short circuit length whereby the leading edge of the fibrillatory front reaches its trailing end in refractory period precluding reentry. Only after a period of myocardial ischemia; i.e., 3 min, enough to slow conduction to allow reentry is that VF becomes self-sustained, as shown in Figure 2.",
    "Remove the guide wire, re-cap the jugular catheter with the 3-way stopcock, remove the ground needle, and allow VF to continue spontaneously for the desire duration of the protocol before starting resuscitation interventions (i.e., 4 to 15 min based on published studies).\n5.2) Chest compressions and positive pressure ventilation\nNOTE: The chest compressor featured in this publication is a custom-made pneumatically driven and electronically controlled piston device. The ventilator is a commercially available device.\nUse the time of untreated VF for the actions described below; although they can be performed before inducing VF.\nMark the chest at 2.8 cm and 4.2 cm from the base of the xiphoid process. The optimal area for initiating chest compressions is typically found between these two marks.\nApply conductive gel to a defibrillation paddle and slide it underneath the rat’s chest, securing the paddle to the surgical board.\nPosition the piston of the chest compressor between the two chest marks slightly touching the chest.\nSet the compressor to deliver 200 compressions per minute and set the initial piston displacement to 0 mm.\n\tNOTE: The compression rate is appropriate for a small animal with a spontaneous heart rate of 350 min-1 but it can be varied as the optimal compression rate for the rat model has not been defined.\nSet the ventilator at 25 min-1 delivering a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 1.0 unsynchronized to chest compression.\nAttach the ventilator tubing (ending in a Y-adaptor connecting the inspiratory and expiratory limbs) to the tracheal cannula leaving interposed the infrared CO2 analyzer adaptor.",
    "Turn on the ventilator and start chest compression by gradually increasing the compression depth from 0 mm to 10 mm during the first minute. Move slightly the piston sidewise and rostrocaudal seeking to find a position that yields the highest aortic diastolic pressure (i.e., pressure between compressions) for a given compression depth.\n\tNOTE: The gradual increase in compression depth is unique to the Resuscitation Institute; most investigators start with the maximal compression depth.\nContinue increasing the compression depth during the second minute until a target aortic diastolic pressure is achieved.\n\tNOTE: A target aortic diastolic pressure of 24 mm Hg or higher yields a coronary perfusion pressure of 20 mm Hg or higher after subtracting the right atrial diastolic pressure; corresponding to the resuscitability threshold for this rat model4. The target aortic diastolic pressure – which may exceed the resuscitability threshold – is to be decided by the investigator based on the study objective. Yet, it is not advisable to exceed a compression depth of 17 mm to avoid injury to the chest wall and intrathoracic organs.\nMaintain chest compressions for the desired duration before attempting defibrillation.\n\tNOTE: Six minutes of chest compression seems to be the minimum required to create myocardial conditions favorable for successful defibrillation26. However, with increasing duration, the hemodynamic efficacy of chest compression declines and most studies use a duration ranging from 6 to 10 min.\n5.3) Defibrillation\nUse a commercially available biphasic waveform defibrillator with capability for internal defibrillation with a starting delivered energy of 5 J, equipped with paddles customized to the rat.\nApply conductive gel to the defibrillation paddle.\nCharge the defibrillator immediately before completing the predetermined duration of chest compressions.\nInterrupt chest compression and verify the heart remains in VF examining the ECG.",
    "Deliver up to two electrical shocks of 5 J each across the chest wall 5 seconds apart if VF is present and observe for return of an electrically organized ECG with aortic pulses and a mean aortic pressure ≥25 mm Hg.\nResume chest compressions for another 30 seconds or 60 seconds (contingent on the specific protocol) if the mean aortic pressure is < 25 mm Hg regardless of the electrical rhythm.\nRepeat the steps from 5.3.4 to 5.3.6 for up to 5 times contingent on the specific protocol but escalating the defibrillation energy to 7 J if the initial 5 J shocks fail to terminate VF. Figure 3 depicts the defibrillation protocol used at the Resuscitation Institute and Figure 4 depicts a representative experiment during the defibrillation phase.\nDeliver electrical shocks only when VF is present; otherwise resume chest compression without preceding electrical shocks and assume the heart is in pulseless electrical activity or asystole.\nDetermine the resuscitation outcome at the completion of the defibrillation-compression cycles (Figure 3).\n5.4) Post-resuscitation\nIncrease the ventilation rate from 25 min-1 to 60 min-1 after return of spontaneous circulation and lower the FiO2 from 1.0 to 0.5 after 15 min of spontaneous circulation.\nDeliver an electrical shock at the same energy of the last shock if VF recurs. However, VF typically reverses spontaneously to sinus rhythm within a few sec.\n\tNOTE: VF recurrence may occur as part of reperfusion arrhythmias shortly after return of spontaneous circulation but rarely beyond 15 min.\nObserve the animal according to the specific post-resuscitation protocol decided by the investigator; typically 180 to 240 min in acute experiments without recovery from anesthesia before euthanasia. The timeline of a typical acute experiment is shown in Figure 5.",
    "Perform necropsy in acute experiments to document position of catheters and injury to internal organs that can render an experiment invalid.\nRemove all catheters, ligate the vessels, and close the wounds with metal clips and follow the steps listed below in survival experiments.\nExtubate the animal provided it is able to breathe spontaneously.\nReturn the animal to a clean cage after recovery from anesthesia evidenced by complete and unassisted self-righting from dorsal recumbency.\nInject warmed 0.9% NaCl (1 ml/100 g body-weight) intraperitoneally to reduce the risk of hypothermia and dehydration.\nAdminister a subcutaneous dose of meloxicam (2 mg/kg) subcutaneously 4 hours after the dose of analgesia followed by a 1 mg/kg subcutaneous dose once daily for up to 72 hr.\nHouse the animal alone with enrichment for up to 48 hr for safer recovery and use the institutional standard operating procedure for post-operative care and monitoring.\nSubscription Required.
