    "The animal experiments presented here were independently reviewed and approved by an institutional and a governmental Animal Care and Use Committee and were conducted according to Federation of Laboratory Animal Science Associations (FELASA) guidelines. All possible measures were taken to minimize suffering including anesthesia and analgesia or, if necessary, premature euthanasia.\n1. Local Tumor Induction via Surgical Adeno-cre Infection\nPreparation of animals for surgery\n\tNOTE: Virtually any conditional (\"floxed\") mutation can be induced via the here described method. The use of mutations in genes relevant in colorectal cancer such as Apc, Kras or Tp53 is recommended. The efficiency of cre recombination is dependent on the size of the construct to be excised. Large floxed sequences are excised less efficiently. The recombination of all alleles should be confirmed in the tumors by PCR.\n\t\nFor the development of colorectal tumors, use a cross of the following conditional alleles for a basic model of CRC (MGI database number in brackets):\n\t\tApctm2Rak (MGI: 3688435)16\n\t\tKrastm4Tyj (MGI: 2429948)17\n\t\tTp53tm2Tyj (MGI: 3039263)18\nIf a fluorescence reporter allele is required (e.g., to detect micrometastases), use the following allele:\n\t\tGt(ROSA)26Sortm6(CAG-ZsGreen1)Hze (MGI: 3809522)19\n\t\tNOTE: All above strains are available via the NCI Mouse Repository or the Jackson Laboratory. No fasting is required as all remaining fecal matter can be flushed out prior to the adenoviral infection. Preoperative fasting leads to higher perioperative mortality and constitutes tremendous stress for small rodents.\nUse sevoflurane at 3 - 3.5 vol% for general anesthesia. A loss of the toe pinch reflex indicates sufficient anesthesia.\nPrior to the first incision, inject 0.05 mg/kg of buprenorphine subcutaneously.\nCover the eyes of the anesthetized mouse with ophthalmic ointment to avoid desiccation of the cornea.\nPlace the mouse in a supine position on a small table. Use non-traumatic adhesive tapes to restrain the mouse.",
    "Shave the abdomen with an electric shaver (depilatory cream can be used alternatively) and disinfect with alcohol swabs or iodine. Use the contact time recommended by the manufacturer.\nCover the surgical field with sterile drapes.\n\t\tNOTE: The use of perioperative antibiotics is optional and subject to institutional guidelines.\nUse sterile single use or sterilized instruments for all surgical procedures.\nMidline laparotomy and exposure of the colon\nUse scissors (scalpels can be used alternatively) to make a midline incision (~ 15 mm) of the skin on the lower abdomen.\nPick up the abdominal wall musculature with forceps and carefully incise it with scissors, thus opening the abdominal cavity.\nIdentify the distal colon, only touch it with atraumatic forceps. Clamp the colon with a delicate clamp (e.g., a Micro Serrefine vascular clamp) approximately 15 mm proximally of the anus.\n\t\tNOTE: Give special attention to the vulnerability of the colon at all times. Perforation inevitably leads to peritonitis and sepsis and requires euthanasia of the animal.\nSegmental colon infection with Adeno-cre virus\nInsert a flexible Teflon tube transanally and carefully advance it until it reaches the lumen occlusion achieved by the clamp previously placed at 15 mm from the anal verge. Do not use excess force as this may lead to perforation.\nCannulate the tube with a 30G cannula, connect a standard 1 mL syringe and flush the colon with normal saline in order to evacuate remaining fecal matter. This may require several mL of saline.\nOnce the distal colon is empty remove the tube and replace it with a fresh Teflon tube and again position it directly distal to the clamp as described above.",
    "Occlude the colon with a second clamp ~ 3 mm distal to the proximal clamp (i.e., over the inserted tube, ~ 12 mm from the anal verge), resulting in a 3 mm isolated segment to be infected.\n\t\tNOTE: For distal occlusion of the segment Fogarty coronary artery clips have proven most suitable as they are rubberized, leading to tight occlusion of the colon despite the intraluminal tube between the clamp's branches.\nUse a second syringe (standard 1 mL with a 30G cannula) to carefully inject 50 - 80 µL of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA into the clamped colon segment and incubate for 10 min. Leave the cannula and the syringe attached to the Teflon tube to prevent the fluid from leaking back.\n\t\tNOTE: The colon must be inflated to break up the mucosal barrier and to reach the crypt stem cells, yet not too much inflated to avoid perforation of the clamped segment.\nFirst remove the distal clamp, and then the trypsin tube.\nFlush the distal colon with ~ 500 µL of normal saline to remove remaining trypsin.\nInsert a new Teflon tube, put the distal clamp back in place and inflate the colon segment with 50 - 80 µL of adenoviral solution (1011 plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL in phosphate-buffered saline) and incubate for 30 min (Figure 2A).\n\t\tNOTE: Do not spill viral solution as contact with adeno-cre may lead to tumor development in any tissue of conditionally mutant mice.\nRemove the clamps and the tube.\nClosure of the abdomen and postoperative recovery\nClose the abdominal wall with 6-0 rapidly absorbable running sutures (e.g., polydioxanone (PDS)).\nClose the skin with surgical wound clips.\nPlace the mouse on heating pad set to 38 °C until it has fully recovered from the anesthesia.",
    "Administer another bolus of 0.05 mg/kg buprenorphine i.p. 12 h after surgery, followed by additional buprenorphine boluses every 12 h if needed.\nMonitor the mice at least once daily for signs of distress due to tumor growth.\n2. Colonoscopy\nNOTE: Depending on the conditional mutations used, adenoviral infection leads to endoscopically visible tumors within 2 - 4 weeks. Therefore, perform the first postoperative colonoscopy 2 weeks after the adenoviral induction and repeat every 2 weeks. A commercially available system is recommended for murine colonoscopy.20\nPreparation of animals for colonoscopy\n\tNOTE: No fasting is required. Remaining fecal matter is usually well-formed in the distal colon and can be pushed beyond the tumor during colonoscopy, thus making the stressful process of repeated fasting unnecessary.\n\t\nUse sevoflurane at 3 - 3.5 vol% for general anesthesia. A loss of the toe pinch reflex indicates sufficient anesthesia.\nCover the eyes of the anesthetized mice with ophthalmic ointment to avoid desiccation of the cornea.\nRestrain the mice in a supine position on a small table.\nColonoscopy\nInsert the scope (diameter 1.9 mm; length 10 cm) into the intestinal tract through the anus and carefully insufflate air under visual control to distend the colon. Do not insufflate more air than required for the examination.\n\t\tNOTE: For air insufflation, the anti-fog air pump of the colonoscopy system may be used. If no anti-fog air pump is available, any other air pump with very low pressure settings can be used, or pressurized air with a delicate pressure-reducing valve. Carbon dioxide (CO2) easily leads to acidosis in small rodents and must therefore be avoided.\nCarefully push the scope forward until a mucosal lesion in the distal colon can be identified (Figure 1A - 1D).",
    "Save endoscopic images for later evaluation. An endoscopic scoring system for intraluminal tumors has been described before.20\nCarefully remove the scope and place the mouse on heating pad set to 38 °C until it has fully recovered from the anesthesia.\nSubscription Required.
