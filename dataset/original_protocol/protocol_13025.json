    "RNase-free ultra pure water (Table 1) was used for the present study.\n1. Concentration determination of RNA solution\nPrepare the RNA sample following the steps below.\n\t\nUse a microcentrifuge tube (0.6 mL) to prepare a solution of RNA by diluting 1 µL of stock solution (obtained via solid-phase synthesis)19 into 159 µL of RNase-free H2O. Mix the solution by pipetting the mixture up and down repeatedly (10x).\n\t\tNOTE: Since a wide range of cuvettes are commercially available, the needed volumes may differ. Cuvettes with a 1 cm pathlength and reduced volume (150 µL) were used in this work.\nRinse the UV-vis cuvette with methanol (2x), followed by water (ultrapure H2O, 3x, see Table of Materials). Use a flow of nitrogen gas to dry the cuvette thoroughly.\nUse a pipette to transfer the solution (step 1.1.1) into the cuvette, ensuring no air bubbles. Cap the cuvette and place it to the side until needed.\nDetermine the concentration of the prepared RNA solution using UV-vis Spectrophotometer.\n\t\nTurn on the UV-Vis spectrophotometer by flipping the switch located in the back of the instrument. Allow the instrument to complete the startup procedure and click on the UV WinLab icon to open the instrument operation/control window.\nTurn on the Peltier Temperature Controller spectrophotometer using the switch located to the instrument's right.\nUnder Base Methods, click on Scan - Lambda 365. Another screen will open and prompt the user to ensure that the cell holders are empty. Click on OK and allow the instrument to conduct its system checks. The system will then display a list of checks, ensure that all \"Pass\" and click on OK.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to follow steps 1.2.1-1.2.3 in the provided order; altering this sequence of events may lead to software malfunction.",
    "Adjust the scanning parameters by selecting Data Collection. In the new window under Scan Settings change the Start to 350 nm and the End to 215 nm.\nActivate the Peltier by selecting the + to the left of the Accessory.

Discard the used volumes into a separate waste tube each time.\nWash the C18 tip with RNase-free water (10 µL) two times. Discard the used volumes into a separate waste tube each time.\nSpot onto the MALDI plate following the steps below.\n\t\nElute the RNA oligonucleotide from the C18 tip (step 3.1.1.7) by immersing the sample into the desired matrix (10 µL, 1:1 solution of C and D, Table 1), followed by dispensing the solution back into the tube. Repeat this process ten times.\nPipette the solution from 3.2.1 onto two separate spots on the plate (1 µL each, 20 pmol). Allow spots to air dry (Figure 1A and Video 1).\n\t\tNOTE: This process can be repeated on the same spot to increase the sample concentration on each spot.\nPipette desired calibrant (1 L) on two separate spots physically close to the sample location and allow to air dry.\n\t\tNOTE: The test standard used in the present study was obtained from commercial sources (see Table of Materials).\nOver-lay the [fully dried] calibrant with the desired matrix (1 L). Allow to air dry.\n\t\t​NOTE: It is important to track the position where the samples and calibrants are spotted prior to insertion into the instrument. Make a note of this using the plate coordinate system, e.g., sample 1 is located at position (C,3)\n4. Data acquisition and processing\nNOTE: In general, THAP requires higher laser power to achieve ionization. Additionally, oligos can be difficult to ionize without fragmenting. Thus, it is usually necessary to use as low laser power as possible and raise detector gains and/or lower laser frequency to maximize detection and minimize fragmentation.\nPerform data acquisition following the steps below.",
    "NOTE: Molecular weight measurements were performed using a mass spectrometer (see Table of Materials) in positive ion, linear mode with an ion source voltage of 20 kV, detector gain of ~2.8 kV, and a laser frequency of 20 Hz. Scan ranges were set based on expected molecular weight(s). These were calculated and expressed as mass over charge (m/z), where the charge was 1. External calibration was performed using a protein calibration mixture (Bacterial Test Standard, see Table of Materials) on a spot adjacent to the sample. The raw data was then processed in the flexAnalysis software (see Table of materials).\n\t\nOpen \"Flexcontrol software\" for operation. Press the instrument's green in/out button, wait for the target stage to move, and vacuum to vent. Open the lid, place the fully dried target plate into the instrument. Ensure to align in the right orientation (Figure 1B).\nGently lower the lid, and then press the green in/out button. Wait for the plate to be retracted and the instrument to pump back down. Once the status bar (lower right corner of the software window) reflects 'Ready', proceed with calibration.\nTo calibrate the instruments using the software, carry out the following.\n\t\t\nSelect the desired method by clicking on the File > Select Method or pressing the Select button adjacent to the loaded method. Click on the Coordinate for the calibrant spot. Navigate to the Calibration tab and confirm the correct calibrant is selected. Ensure Random Walk is turned off (in the Sample Carrier tab).\nPress Start and manually direct the laser along a crystal (clicking the mouse arrow at the desired location in the camera view). Adjust laser power, if necessary. Once satisfied with the settings, press Start to collect spectra and add them to the sum buffer.",
    "Add spectra to the sum until sufficient intensity is reached. Toggle to view only the sum buffer, subtract the baseline, and smooth. Then click on Automatic Assign. Check each assigned peak and note the ppm error. If satisfied with assignments and errors, click on Apply.\nClear the sum buffer and navigate to the position of the first sample.\nConfirm the desired scan range ('Detection' tab). Adjust the bars in the \"Mass Range\" so that the green region is representative of expected mass(es).\nClick directly on the Magnification window so that the crosshairs are oriented at the desired crystalized fragment (larger crystals often yield the best results, Figure 2).\nCollect a few spectra along the large crystals, adjusting the laser power as necessary. The proper setting is 5%-10% above the power at which peaks appear.\nTo obtain spectra, perform the following.\n\t\t\nClick on Start to observe the laser flash in tandem with increasing spectral intensity (shown in the window in the upper right). Move the laser along the length of the crystal by clicking the mouse arrow up and down the crystal (Video 2).\nClick on Add directly below Start.\nRepeat this several times until desired intensity/number of shots is reached (reflected on the y-axis of the spectral window)\nAdjust the laser power and/or speed and/or detector gains if the initial scans are unsatisfactory. Repeat steps 4.1.4.1-4.1.4.3 as needed.\nIf satisfied with the spectrum, click on Save As to save the spectrum under a specified name. Then, if other samples are needed, click on Clear Sum and repeat steps under step 4.1.4.\nPerform data processing.\n\tNOTE: Step 4.2 describes one way to analyze the data using the flexAnalysis software.\n\t\nOpen the desired software. Then, open spectrum (a) by selecting File. From the dropdown menu, select Open.",
    "A new window will be displayed. Click on Browse to locate the files saved from step 4.1.4. Check the boxes for the desired files, and then click on Open on the left. If only a single spectrum requires analysis, simply drag, and drop the file into the software window.\nHighlight the loaded file(s) for bulk analysis. Navigate to the Process tab on the toolbar.
