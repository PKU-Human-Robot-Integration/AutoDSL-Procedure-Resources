    "All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Baylor College of Medicine.\n1. Preparation of [6,6-2H2]glucose\nOne day before the procedure, prepare the stable isotope glucose tracer in normal saline. For this experiment, [6,6-2H2]glucose was used as a tracer to measure plasma glucose appearance rate.\n\tNOTE: In this experiment, glucose production during fasting and glucose-rich conditions were measured, so the glucose isotope was prepared in two different preparations. Prepare the solutions in such a way that the final infusing dose will be close to 1 mg/(kg·min) and 2 mg/(kg·min), respectively. These concentrations were optimized by several prior pilot studies.\nPrepare the first infusate with only [6,6-2H2]glucose as a tracer to represent the fasting condition by dissolving sterile and pyrogen free [6,6-2H2]glucose in sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution.\nPrepare the second infusate by dissolving both [6,6-2H2]glucose tracer along with non-isotopic glucose (~20 mg/kg·min) in sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution to simulate the fed condition.\n\tNOTE: In the present experiment, a primed constant rate infusion of [6,6-2H2]glucose at (~) 1.08 mg/(kg·min) (fasting condition) and (~) 1.9 mg/kg·min (glucose rich condition) was used. In order to mimic the 'glucose rich condition', D-glucose infusion rate was set at (~) 18.8 mg/(kg·min).\nOnce the solutions are prepared, sterile filter the solutions with a 0.22 µm filter and store at 4 °C. Warm the solutions to room temperature prior to the infusion. Load the solutions on prelabeled 1 mL syringes.\nSet up the pump to facilitate a primed constant rate infusion of the first infusate (for basal condition) containing only the tracer, and program the pump for a constant rate infusion of the isotope at 150 µL/h for 3 h.",
    "At the end of the 3 h fasting set up, replace the first infusate syringe with the second infusate syringe containing the isotopic tracer and D-glucose (for the simulated fed state), and prime the infusion for the intial 15 min at 600 µL/h. Set the pump to a constant rate infusion at 150 µL/h for the additional 3 h.\n2. Set-up of infusion experiments\nRemove the mice from their home cages and place them in their fasting cages 3 h prior to the start of the experiment. For this experiment, a 4-month-old female mice from the C57BL/6J strain was used.\n\tNOTE: This procedure does not require any analgesia prior to or during the procedure given its minimally invasive nature.\nAssemble the caging equipment by grouping the mice into a set number of mice per insulin pump. Place partitions on top of a flat, stable base to make individual stalls for the mice. It is important to have access to the tail vein catheter for the infusion to run, so ensure that there is a notch in the bottom of the cage door.\n\tNOTE: Cages shown in the video were made specifically for this experiment. Cages are clear and made out of plexiglass. There is a flat, stable base (standard caging equipment) upon which the partitions sit. This setup consists of several pieces to allow ease of setup in several different environments depending on the height of the table and the needs of the experimenter. The door to the cage slides to close and has a notch at the bottom to allow the tail to fit through.\nAssemble the 1 mL syringes containing 1 mL of basal infusate, and then connect to the infusion pump tubing using the polyethylene tubing 0.28 mm ID x 0.61 mm.",
    "Prepare the infusion pump by setting the rate to 150 µL/h, which is the basal rate.\nHeat a water bath to 48 °C.\nPrepare the catheter insertion station adjacent to the water bath containing the 30 G 0.5 inch needles, 0.3 mm ID x 0.64 mm silastic tubing, and 1 inch clear transpore tape.\nAfter 3 h of fasting, begin the catheter insertion process, which is detailed below.\n3. Catheter insertion\nSelect one mouse and place it in a secure holder with access to the tail. An example of what to use is a bottle cut in half with a notch for the tail. Place the holder on a flat base. Place a piece tape over the proximal portion of the tail to allow space for catheter insertion more distally.\n\tNOTE: The type of tape chosen for this task must have moderate strength and adhesiveness. Multipurpose, paper-based labeling tape was used in this experiment as it is mild and easy to peel off.\nPrepare the catheter (30 G needle attached to 0.3 mm silastic tubing and PE- 10 were gas sterilized) by attaching it to a 1 mL syringe containing sterile heparinized saline flush. Flush the catheter gently.\nBring the mouse to the water bath and insert the tail in the water bath for approximately 30-45 s. This helps to dilate the tail vasculature for catheter placement.",
    "Perform the catheter insertion under sterile conditions. Once the tail is warmed, clean the tail with benzalkonium wipes and place a small copper, toothless alligator clamp, that was previously contoured to the shape of the tail, as a tourniquet at the proximal end of the tail. Visualize the lateral tail vein under a magnifying glass, and then carefully insert the catheter into the tail vein and withdraw the needle. Flush the solution gently to ensure patency of the catheter.\nWrap a piece of 1 inch transpore tape around the insertion site to secure the catheter. Remove the small tourniquet from the tail.\n4. Infusion set-up and first infusion\nPlace the mouse in its individual cage and close the sliding door, ensuring the tail is protruding through the notch and remains outside of the cage.\nPlace an additional piece of tape over the whole catheter and the tail to secure it to the base plate of the cage. Multipurpose colored, label tape was used for this step.\nDisconnect the flush from the tail vein catheter and place a small clamp on the catheter's silastic tubing to prevent backflow while connecting the infusate line from the pump.\nOnce securely connected, remove the clamp and flush with the priming solution, which consists of the infusate. Ensure that the solution is clear in the tubing and not blood-stained.\nMake note of the time of initiation of the infusion to ensure that it runs for the total time of approximately 3 h. If multiple cages are used simultaneously, they should be staggered to manage infusion times effectively.\nOnce infusion lines are noted to be functioning properly, remove the cover from the mouse. Place standard bedding around the mouse.",
    "Start the infusion with the first infusate containing the tracer and run it for 3 h continuously. For the duration of the infusion, continue to check mice wellbeing as well as infusion lines. Ensure that the infusion tubing is properly secured and that there are no leaks from the line connection points.\n5. Blood sampling\nAfter the first infusion has completed, stop the infusion, place a clamp on the sylastic tubing on the catheter to prevent back flow. Gently remove the mice from their enclosures without disturbing the catheter in order to collect blood. Place them at a spot near the cages for blood draw. For this experiment, the mice underwent cheek venipuncture using a 4 mm lancet.\nCollect ~75 µL of blood in the desired vial. To deproteinize samples in preparation for mass spectrometry, add approximately 15 µL of blood to 500 µL of acetone. The remaining blood can be used to check the blood glucose level via the glucometer and/or centrifuged to separate plasma for future hormone assays.\n6. Second infusion\nRemove the infusates from the syringe pumps by disconnecting the tubing from the syringes and replace it with the second infusate containing the tracer along with the glucose. Repeat steps 4.2 through 4.7 using the glucose-rich isotopic glucose infusion.\n\t\nTo reach a steady state, run a bolus of the second infusate at 600 µL/h for 15 min. Note the starting time for each group of cages. Decrease the infusion rate to 150 µL/h to complete the 3 h of total infusion time.\nRepeat steps 5.1 and 5.2.\nStop the infusion pump and remove the tail vein catheter gently, apply pressure at the catheter sites until the bleeding stops, and return mice to their home cages.\nSantize and disinfect the caging setup thoroughly with standard soap and water.",
    "NOTE: This is a survival procedure. Mice can be returned to cages and kept for further experiements if needed. It is recommended that no further experiementation is performed for at least a week following this procedure to ensure adequate animal welfare.\n7. Mass spectrometry\nSend out the samples for mass spectrometry.\nAnalyses\n\t\nMeasure the isotopic enrichment of [6,6-2H2]glucose by gaschromatography - mass spectrometry (GCMS) using the pentaacetate derivative21,22. Briefly, this method involves preparation of the pentaacetate derivative of glucose, followed by sample analysis using GCMS 20,22.\nCalculations\n\t\nPerform all kinetic measurements under steady state conditions. Total plasma glucose appearance rate (glucose Ra) was calculated from the M+2 enrichment of [6,6-2H2]glucose in plasma using established isotope dilution equations21. Under steady state conditions, it is assumed that the rate of appearance of glucose is equal to the rate of disappearance of glucose. Rate of endogenous glucose production (mg/(kg·min)) (GPR) = glucoseRa - exogenous glucose.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
