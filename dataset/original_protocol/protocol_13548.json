    "The study was approved by the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University. Diagnostic criteria, surgical indications, and contraindications were in accordance with the Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Andrology and Expert Consensus of the Chinese Society of Andrology and the European Association of Urology Guidelines for Sexual and Reproductive Health. A patient would be excluded from this study if the female partner had medical conditions that affect fertility.\n1. Instruments for operation\nEnsure the availability of sterilized instruments and other equipment mentioned in the Table of Materials.\n2. Preparation for operation\nPrepare the bowel prior to surgery (by defecation).\nPrepare the perineal skin before surgery (by shaving off the hair).\nAdminister intramuscular scopolamine (20 mg) or atropine (0.5 mg) and an intravenous infusion of cefazolin sodium (1 g) with 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution 30 min before surgery.\nPlace the patient in the supine position on the operating table after combined spinal-epidural anesthesia.\nDisinfect the surgical area with 1% iodophor and cover it with surgical towels.\n3. Vessel-sparing modified single-armed LIVE\nInsert a 16 French or 16Fr Foley catheter, and mark the incision sites with a skin marker.\nDeliver the testis through a 3-4 cm vertical scrotal incision.\nExpose the vas deferens with a vas-fixation clamp next to the spermatic cord near the testis. Pass a vascular sling through the space between the vas deferens and the vas deferens vasculature. Apply traction to the vascular sling, separate the connective tissue with microhemostatic forceps under the operating microscope, and cut with an electric knife. Carefully dissociate deferential vessels with the microhemostatic forceps by 1 cm from the vas deferens under the operating microscope (Figure 1).",
    "After hemisecting the vas deferens with a knife (Figure 2A), confirm the patency of the vas deferens by injection of diluted methylene blue with a 24 G irrigating needle connected to a 1 mL syringe and observation of dye in the urine, or by injection of 0.9% sodium chloride solution with no resistance or reflux (Figure 2B).\nSeparate the adhesion between the tunica vaginalis and the testis with microhemostatic forceps, and cut with an electric knife after opening the tunica vaginalis. Examine the epididymis under the operating microscope, and select the site of dilated epididymal tubule for anastomosis. Cut a 5 mm diameter piece of the epididymal tunic using ophthalmic scissors at this position.\nCompletely transect the vas deferens with a knife, and ligate the broken end of the vas deferens near the epididymis with silk, braided, nonabsorbable suture. Perforate the tunica vaginalis using hemostatic forceps and pass the isolated part of the vas deferens through the tunnel to reach the anastomosis site (Figure 3A). Fix the vas deferens and epididymis tunic using two interrupted 8-0 polypropylene sutures, and ensure the vas deferens is not twisted at the same time. Use microscopic bipolar coagulation to stop the vas deferens from bleeding to keep the operative field clear (Figure 3B).",
    "After marking four suture sites on the vas deferens (equidistant distribution on the section of the vas deferens, Figure 4A), perform this modified single-armed suture technique for LIVE using two single-armed 10-0 polypropylene sutures7. Pass two needles through the inferior points of the vasal mucosal layer separately in an outside-in fashion (Figure 4A: a1, b1), using a microneedle holder to slightly dilate the vasal lumen and accurately control the needle under the microscope. Avoid hooking the needle into the back wall of the lumen (Figure 4B). Move the two needles in parallel and longitudinally through the same epididymal tubule.\nPlace two needles in the epididymal tubule, opened longitudinally between the two needles using a 15Â° ophthalmic knife (Figure 5A). Aspirate the epididymal fluid flowing from the incision in the tubule with a 24 G irrigating needle connected to a 1 mL syringe, and hand it to an examiner to check for sperm (Figure 5B).\nGently pull out two needles in the epididymal tubule separately and pass them through the superior points (Figure 6A: a2, b2) of the vasal mucosal layer in an inside-out fashion. Suture the adventitia of the vas deferens and the epididymal tunic with an 8-0 polypropylene suture to reduce tension before intussusception of the epididymal tubule into the vas deferens can be performed (Figure 6B).\nSuture the muscularis edge of the vas deferens and the epididymal tunic using 10-12 interrupted sutures of 9-0 polypropylene (Figure 7).\n4. Postoperative care\nEnsure that the patient waits for 6 h after the operation before eating, takes bed rest for 3 days, and avoids standing or walking.\nContinue intravenous antibiotics (cefazolin sodium, 1 g with 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution) after the surgery to avoid genitourinary tract infection or epididymitis.\nSubscription Required.
