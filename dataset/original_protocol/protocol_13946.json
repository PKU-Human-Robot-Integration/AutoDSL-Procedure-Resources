    "All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Australian code for the care and use of animals for scientific purposes at QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute with approval from the institute animal ethics committee. Male C57BL/6 mice (15−20 weeks old) were obtained from the Animal Resources Centre, WA, Australia.\nNOTE: All solutions, media, instruments, hardware, and tubes that contact the samples must be sterilized or thoroughly disinfected with a 70% ethanol solution and handled using sterile techniques to minimize the risk of culture contamination.\n1. Setup of the vibratome\nPrepare sterile Krebs-Henseleit buffer solution with 2 g/L glucose (Table of Materials[href=https://www.jove.com/pdf-materials/60992?refresh=1]). Check that the pH of the buffer is 7.4. If the pH is higher, saturate the buffer with carbogen (95% O2 + 5% CO2) or incubate within a 5% CO2 tissue culture incubator to correct the bicarbonate buffering system. Refrigerate the sealed sterile buffer solution at 4 °C.\nInsert the vibratome blade into the cutting arm. Make sure the blade is tightly fixed to the cutting arm, as vibrations can cause the blade to come loose.\nDisinfect the blade and cutting arm with a 70% ethanol solution.\n\tCAUTION: Avoid contact with the blade.\nDisinfect the buffer tray with a 70% ethanol solution and wipe it with a sterile tissue.\nInsert the buffer tray into the vibratome and tighten the mounting mechanism.\nSet the cutting arm to the maximum available height.\nSet the blade angle to 10° below horizontal, sloping downwards to the sample. Make sure that the blade angle is tightly fixed.\n\tNOTE: The optimal blade angle may differ depending on the vibratome model and tissue characteristics.\nDisinfect the specimen holder with a 70% ethanol solution.\nConnect the cooling water for the Peltier thermoelectric cooler located under the buffer tray.",
    "NOTE: Some vibratome models use an ice-bath for cooling instead.\nFix the water-out tube to a drain and turn on the water. Set the cooler to 4 °C. Run cooling water at a rate of >400 mL/min.\nFill the buffer tray almost to the top with sterile ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer (with 2 g/L glucose). Leave additional Krebs-Henseleit buffer solution on ice.\n2. Liver removal and preparation\nSterilize or disinfect all surgical instruments including curved forceps, flat square-tip forceps, tweezers, surgical clamps, and scissors using autoclaving.\nPrior to liver removal, deeply anesthetize mice using an intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg ketamine and 12.5 mg/kg xylazine.\n\tNOTE: Other anesthetics may be used, or mice can be euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation/cervical dislocation if the liver is quickly removed to prevent hypoxia-induced damage.\nDisinfect skin surfaces on mice by wetting with a 70% ethanol solution. Secure mice on their backs with all extremities pinned to a dissecting board.\nMake a vertical midline incision into the skin from the base of the abdominal cavity to just above the diaphragm.\n\tNOTE: Incisions towards the extremities are made to facilitate the retraction of the skin.\nPull the skin back while cutting any connective tissue between the skin and abdominal cavity. Prevent hair from being transferred to the abdominal cavity as much as possible. Pin or clamp the skin away from the abdominal cavity.\nUsing clean forceps and scissors, open the abdominal cavity and lower thoracic cavity.\nRemoving the liver quickly without damaging the lobes\n\t\nUsing blunt tools (e.g., flat square-tip forceps), guide the upper liver lobes downwards towards the abdomen. Cut the connective tissue surrounding the upper liver lobes using scissors.\nGuide the liver lobes upwards towards the diaphragm. Hold the central vascular bundle of the liver with forceps.",
    "NOTE: It will not affect the procedure if the central vascular bundle is damaged.\nPull the central vascular bundle away from the mouse and cut the remaining connective tissue, blood vessels, etc. to remove the liver. Take care not to 1) damage the liver lobes and 2) cut into the gastrointestinal tract, as this may contaminate the liver with microorganisms.\nPlace the removed liver into a sterile 10 cm tissue culture dish half-filled with ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer solution. Using a blunt instrument to guide the lobes, cut the center of the liver to divide it into separate lobes.\nSelect one liver lobe (use the largest first), and place it flat side down onto a new sterile 10 cm dish. Keep all other liver lobes in the dish of Krebs-Henseleit buffer solution stored on ice for subsequent use.\nTrim around 10% of the material from the tallest edge of the liver lobe while lying flat.\n\tNOTE: Trimming is important, as this tissue edge will contact the cutting blade first; therefore, a tissue edge that is relatively perpendicular to the cutting blade will prevent tissue compression that can occur because of shallow angles in the uncut liver lobes.\nTrim the other three tissue edges.\n\tNOTE: This removes some of the fibrous Glisson's capsule and will make separation of the tissue slices easier.\nMounting the liver lobe on the specimen holder\n\t\nPlace a thin layer of cyanoacrylate glue (superglue or medical/veterinary grade cyanoacrylate glue) on the specimen holder towards the front, sized slightly larger than the trimmed liver lobe.\n\t\tNOTE: Check that the cyanoacrylate glue does not contain non-cyanoacrylate additives.",
    "Gently pick up the liver lobe with sterile forceps using a corner away from the cutting edge, then pat dry any residual buffer from the flat side of the liver lobe using sterile absorbent material.\nPlace the large flat side of the liver lobe on the cyanoacrylate glue patch with the largest edge facing towards the front. Allow it to cure in the air for 1−2 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Cyanoacrylate adhesives cure quickly (~2 min) in response to residual moisture and tissue proteins, and they will firmly attach the tissue to the specimen holder.\n3. Production of liver slices\nPlace the specimen holder with the attached liver lobe into the vibratome buffer tray. Make sure the liver lobe is fully covered by buffer.\n\tNOTE: If needed, top up the level of ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer solution. If the buffer level obscures the cutting process, increase or decrease the level.\nSet the cutting speed.\n\tNOTE: This may need to be empirically determined depending on the vibratome model and blade characteristics. As a starting guide, use a speed of 57 Hz/3,420 rpm. The vibratome speed can be measured using an audio spectrum analyzer application on a smartphone.\nLower the cutting blade until it is located just above the liver lobe using the height dial. Run the vibrating cutting arm over the sample.\nReturn the blade back using the crank handle in reverse. Activate the vibrations while returning the blade. After the blade has returned and is not above the sample, lower the blade height by 250 µm.\nRepeat the cutting process until the top of the tissue is removed. Discard the first one or two slices, as these will contain Glisson's capsule and therefore do not contain much functional liver tissue compared to other slices.",
    "To cut liver slices, slowly advance the vibrating blade into the tissue by turning the handle. Use a small paintbrush (disinfected with a 70% ethanol solution) to gently guide the tissue during the cutting process.\nUse the paintbrush to lift the cut tissue slices and place the tissue slice into a sterile tube of ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer. When not in use, keep this tube on ice between slices.\n\tNOTE: Sometimes, the tissue does tear during the cutting process, but for most purposes the tissue is still usable.\nRepeat the cutting process until the base of the liver lobe is reached. Discard any liver slices that have visible cured glue.\n\tNOTE: The cured glue is visible as white areas on the tissue slices. A typical liver lobe will only have a useable thickness of around 2 mm. Therefore, only around eight 250 µm liver slices are produced from each lobe.\nCut the tissue slices until near the cyanoacrylate glue. Do not cut into the glue.\nRepeat the whole process with other liver lobes until the required number of tissue slices is obtained.\nTo clean the cured cyanoacrylate glue and tissue from specimen holder, either use a blade to scrape the cured glue/tissue mixture off, or soften and clean the mixture with acetone or dimethyl sulfoxide.\n4. Tissue culture\nNOTE: All tissue culture work must be performed in a sterile laminar flow hood.\nIn a tissue culture laminar flow hood, pipette 1 mL of William's E medium containing 2.0 g/L glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine supplement, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin into 12 well tissue culture plates.",
    "NOTE: Other antibiotics and antifungal agents may also be added. Some studies have used additives in the tissue incubation medium (i.e., dexamethasone and insulin10), but these can interfere with cell signaling.\nPlace the tube containing liver slices from ice into the tissue culture hood. To remove the tissue slices, gently swirl the mixture and gently tip into a sterile 10 cm dish while swirling.\nUsing sterile sharp-point forceps and a scalpel, cut the tissue slices into roughly uniform sizes (e.g., 15 mm2).\n\tNOTE: This step is performed to ensure a consistent surface area. Because mouse liver lobes are significantly different in size and some tissue slices will tear, this will produce a range of PCLS with varying surface areas. The final surface area sizes of the PCLS depend on how much material is needed in subsequent analysis applications and how many replicates are needed. Cutting large PCLS into smaller multiple pieces of the same approximate size will innately allow an increased number of experimental replicates.\nUsing sterile forceps or a small paintbrush, transfer the cut tissue slices to the wells of a 12 well plate containing 1 mL of medium.\n\tNOTE: Take care to confirm the consistency of thickness and shape of tissue slices. Sections that are darker than average suggest the tissue thickness is larger and need to be discarded. Lighter slices suggest the presence of cured cyanoacrylate glue and need to be discarded.\nIncubate the liver slices at 37 °C and 5% CO2 under 95% humidity.\n\tNOTE: Other groups have used methods to enhance oxygen delivery to PCLS, which appear to prolong tissue survival time6,10,11,12,13 (see discussion section).",
    "On the following day, change the culture medium using a manual pipette (rather than suction) to prevent the loss of tissue through suction errors. Subsequently, change the medium on the PCLS daily. The PCLS are now ready for experimental use.\n5. Example application of PCLS\nAt 16 h post-generation, treat PCLS with three different bile acids: glycocholic acid (GCA), taurocholic acid (TCA), and cholic acid (CA) (as sodium salts, all at a concentration of 150 µM) for 2 days.\nAfter 2 days of bile acid treatment, extract mRNA by placing tissue slices in ice-cold RNA lysis buffer and quickly homogenize using beads with a bead homogenizer (Table of Materials[href=https://www.jove.com/pdf-materials/60992?refresh=1]).\nPurify the RNA using an RNA isolation kit (Table of Materials[href=https://www.jove.com/pdf-materials/60992?refresh=1]) and create cDNA from the purified RNA.\nPerform quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Table of Materials[href=https://www.jove.com/pdf-materials/60992?refresh=1]) using specific primers (Table 1) on the cDNA to examine gene expression.\nSubscription Required.
