    "All research protocols involving ICR mice were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Yonsei University at Wonju College of Medicine. Experiments were performed according to the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association. In this protocol, pregnant ICR mice were kept in a 12/12 h light/dark cycle with free access to food and water.\n1. Cochleae dissection\nSterilize the laminar flow tissue culture hood by turning on the ultraviolet light for ~30 min, and spray all surfaces with 70% ethanol prior to use. Allow the surfaces to dry.\nPlace dissection instruments in 70% ethanol for 10 min, and dry before using.\nUse an operating blade to decapitate postnatal 3-4 day-old mice (Figure 2A).\nPlace the skull under a stereomicroscope in the laminar flow hood, and soak the tissue in 70% ethanol.\nQuickly soak the tissue in tissue dissection solution (1x Hank's Balanced Salt Solution, 1 mM HEPES) to remove the ethanol.\nCut the centerline of the skull with a surgical blade (Figure 2B,C).\nExpose the skull by pulling down the skin anteriorly and cutting the external auditory canal of the ear (Figure 2D).\nCut from the anterior to the posterior part of the cranium across the eye line (Figure 2E).\nOpen the skull and remove the forebrain, cerebellum, and brainstem with blunt forceps (Figure 2F,G).\nUsing micro forceps, separate the cochlea from the temporal bone (Figure 2H).\nTransfer the cochleae to a Petri dish containing tissue dissection solution.\nCarefully dissect all of the cochlear otic capsule, leaving only the internal cochlear soft tissue (Figure 2I,J).\nHold the modiolus of the cochleae with forceps and the cochlear duct with another pair of forceps, and slowly separate the two tissues (Figure 2K).\nRemove the stria vascularis and tectorial membrane by gently peeling them away (Figure 2L,M).",
    "Place a sterilized plastic coverslip in new tissue dissection solution, and then place the organ of Corti on a coverslip of 9 mm diameter, making sure that the basilar membrane faces downward (Figure 2N-P).\nImmobilize the tissue by pressing the Reissner's membrane and the remaining modiolus tissue onto the coverslip with forceps (Figure 2N-P).\nTransfer the coverslip with the embedded tissue to the center of a confocal dish of 35 mm diameter.\nPlace the glass cloning cylinder on the dish, with the cochlear explant positioned in the center of the dish, and add 100 µL of explant culture medium (DMEM/F12, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% N2 supplement, ampicillin (10 µg/mL))10 inside the cylinder (Figure 2Q).\nPlate 5 × 103 cells of mouse bone marrow-derived green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged MSCs in 2 mL of culture medium (45% DMEM + 45% DMEM/F12, 10% FBS, 1% N2 supplement, 10 µg/mL of ampicillin) outside the glass cylinder (Figure 2R).\n\t\nWhen the MSCs are 80-90% confluent, passage them by detaching them with trypsin-ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid.\nCarefully transfer the confocal dish to a humidified incubator and incubate overnight at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.\nAspirate all medium inside and outside the cylinder, and then remove the glass cylinder from the confocal dish.\nAdd 2 mL of fresh culture medium to the confocal dish, and incubate the tissue culture dish in a humidified incubator until ready for analysis.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61947/61947fig2v2.jpg",

Time-lapse imaging\nFor the experiments presented here, use a confocal microscopy system with a stage top incubator system.\nTurn on the confocal microscope, fluorescent light, and computer.\nSet the conditions of the stage-top incubator placed on the stage of the confocal microscope to 37 °C and 5% CO2 atmosphere.\nPlace the sample dish on the dish fixing vessel, cover with the dish fixing lid, and close the chamber with the top heater lid.\nAdjust the zoom and focus to localize the organ of Corti and MSCs in the field of view.\nOpen the image processing software. Under the locate option, select a 20x Plan-Apochromat objective (numerical aperture 0.8) and a 0.5x crop area.\nUnder Acquisition, click on smart setup and select EGFP.",
    "Open the channel tab under Acquisition, and set the laser power to 0.2%, the pinhole to 44 µm, the master gain to 750 V, and the digital gain to 1.0.\nClick on ESID under imaging setup, and set the ESID gain to 4 and the digital gain to 7.5.\nClick on Tiles and stake to produce 210 tiles.\nOpen Focus strategy and select the focus mode.\nUnder time series, set the duration to 24 h and the interval to 10 min.\nUnder Acquisition, set the frame size to 512 x 512 pixels, scan speed to 8, the direction to bidirectional, the averaging to 4x, and the bits per pixel to 16.\nClick on start experiment to begin the experiment.\n3. Image file modification\nUnder processing, click on stitching, and set the minimal overlay to 5% and the maximal shift to 10%.\nClick on movie export, set uncompressed, and set the speed to 7.5.\n4. Immunostaining\nAspirate the medium carefully, and wash the sample twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 5 min.\nFix the sample with 4% formalin in PBS for 15 min, and wash the sample 3 times with PBS for 5 min.\nPermeabilize the sample in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, and wash 3 times with PBS for 5 min.\nAdd 250 µL of phalloidin-iFluor 647 reagent (1:1000 dilution in PBS), and incubate the sample for 1 h at room temperature on the shaker.\nWash the sample 3 times with PBS for 5 min.\nTransfer the coverslip onto the glass slide, and add 2 drops of mounting solution.\nPlace a coverslip on the slide gently.\nSeal the coverslip with clear nail polish and store at 4 °C in the dark until cells are observed.",
    "Image the slide using a confocal microscope with an appropriate filter at excitation/emission (Ex/Em)=650/665 nm for phalloidin and at Ex/Em=488/507 nm for EGFP.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
