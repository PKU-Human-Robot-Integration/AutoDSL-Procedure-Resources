    "Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.635#cpz1635-prot-0001] describes the maintenance and transfection of IMR90-4 induced pluripotent stem cells (Yu et al., 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.635#cpz1635-bib-0026]). The iPSCs are genetically modified at the AAVS1 safe-harbor locus using a double-plasmid CRISPR/Cas9 transfection method. The backbone that encodes the Cas9 endonuclease is the enhanced-specificity Cas9 (eSpCas9(1.1)) plasmid, which was a gift from Feng Zhang (Slaymaker et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.635#cpz1635-bib-0017]). The sequence of the AAVS1 safe-harbor locus T2 single guide RNA (sgRNA) site (Oceguera-Yanez et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.635#cpz1635-bib-0015]) must be cloned into the eSpCas9(1.1) vector. The second plasmid backbone used in this protocol is pAAVS1-P-MCS, which contains sequences for the AAVS1 safe-harbor locus homology arms and the puromycin resistance gene. pAAVS1-P-MCS was a gift from Knut Woltjen (Oceguera-Yanez et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.635#cpz1635-bib-0015]). The Ef1a-HTLV promoter and the coding sequence of the Gaussia luciferase reporter protein are cloned into the pAAVS1-P-MCS vector. These two elements are referred to as the “donor DNA” throughout the following protocols. Lipofectamine 3000 reagent, which has been specially designed to more efficiently transfect difficult cell lines, is used for the transfection. Stably transfected clones are selected with puromycin antibiotic. Once the selection is done, stably transfected monoclonal cell lines are expanded by performing single-cell dilutions in 96-well plates. An overview is provided in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.635#cpz1635-fig-0002] (numbers in the subheadings below refer to those in the figure).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/44214bf8-491a-4d5b-96ba-d69e08e94487/cpz1635-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2",

(A) Plasmid mapping of the eSpCas9(1.1)-AAVS1-T2 and pAAVS1-P-MCS no tag GLuc vectors. Summary of the three major experimental sections of Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.635#cpz1635-prot-0001]. First, prepare the plasmids necessary for the CRISPR/Cas9 double transfection. Part 1: Anneal the oligonucleotides encoding the gRNA and clone into the eSpCas9(1.1) backbone. The resulting vector, known as \"eSpCas9(1.1) AAVS1-T2,” is used for the expression of Cas9 and its guide to the AAVS1 safe-harbor locus. Part 2a: Clone donor DNA in between homology arms corresponding to AAVS1 safe-harbor locus. PCR amplify the Ef1-HTLV promoter and clone into the pAAVS1-P-MCS backbone. The resulting vector is called “pAAVS1-P-MCS_Ef1-HTLV”. Part 2b: PCR amplify the coding sequence of Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) and clone into the pAAVS1-P-MCS_Ef1-HTLV” vector. The resulting vector, known as “pAAVS1-P-MCS no tag Gluc,” is used as a template for homology directed repair at the AAVS1 safe harbor. Part 3: Carry out a double plasmid transfection using the eSpCas9(1.1)-AAVS1-T2 and pAAVS1-P-MCS no tag GLuc vectors. Use selection medium to isolate clones containing a stable integration the donor DNA into their genomic DNA. Immediately carry out Support Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.635#cpz1635-prot-0002] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.635#cpz1635-prot-0003] in order to verify GLuc expression and to verify successful monoclonal isolation of the stably transfected cells.

    "1. To prepare the plasmid encoding Cas9 endonuclease (eSpCas9(1.1)), streak the bacterial stab onto an LB agar plate (100 µg ampicillin/ml LB agar) using a sterile toothpick or pipette tip in a zigzag pattern while working in a sterile laminar flow hood for microbiology. Incubate the plate upside down overnight at 37°C.\nThe vector backbones used in this protocol contain the ampicillin-resistance cassette. If you are using other vectors, check their specific antibiotic selection gene.\nBe careful not to puncture the agar while streaking the bacteria.\n2. Pick individual colonies of the plasmid-containing bacteria using a sterile toothpick or pipette tip and inoculate a liquid culture in LB medium (100 µg ampicillin/ml LB medium) in a non-air-tight vessel overnight at 37°C while shaking. The next day, use the liquid culture to isolate the eSpCas9(1.1) plasmid DNA using a miniprep, midiprep, or maxiprep plasmid isolation kit, following the manufacturer's instructions.\nInoculate the culture in 5 ml, 50 ml, or 250 ml LB medium, depending on the size of the plasmid isolation kit.\nIt is a good idea to create glycerol stocks of the bacteria containing your stock plasmid. To do so, combine 500 µl of liquid culture 1:1 with 50% sterile glycerol in a screw-cap tube, mix well, and store at –80°C.\n3. Digest the eSpCas9(1.1) vector isolated from the bacteria using the restriction enzyme BbsI for 30 min at 37°C, as described below.\n         \ntable:\n﻿0,1\nReagent,Amount\neSpCas9(1.1) vector,2 µg\n10× buffer,2 µl\n10 U/µl BbsI restriction enzyme,1 µl\nH2O,Adjust volume to 20 µl",
    "The eSpCas9(1.1) vector contains two BbsI recognition sites neighboring each other, directly flanking the gRNA scaffold. The complete digestion of both BbsI site excises 22 bp from the vector and creates incompatible overhangs, which prevents the reannealing of the digested vector and creates sticky-end overhangs to match the annealed AAVS1-T2 oligonucleotides (step 8). Be careful when designing the sticky-end overhangs created by the oligonucleotides: the BbsI restriction enzyme cuts GAAGAC(N2/N6) downstream of its recognition site and therefore will generate vector-specific overhangs.\n4. Promptly dephosphorylate the digested vector by adding 1 µl FastAP alkaline phosphatase to the reaction. Incubate for another 15 min at 37°C.\n5. Inactivate the reaction at 75°C for 5 min.\n6. Purify the digested vector by loading the sample into wells of a 1% agarose/TAE gel, along with DNA size ladder mix. Run the gel in 1× TAE buffer in a horizontal gel electrophoresis chamber at 130 V for 1 hr. Visualize the gel using 0.25 µl/ml ethidium bromide, or an equivalent method, using the Gel Doc EZ imager (or equivalent gel imager).\n7. Precisely excise the digested vector from the gel and use an agarose gel clean-up kit (for example, from Roboklon) to purify the sample, following the manufacturer's instructions.\n8. Anneal and phosphorylate the oligonucleotides (AAVS1T2_eSpCas9_S, AAVS1T2_eSpCas9_AS; see Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.635#cpz1635-tbl-0001] for oligonucleotide sequences) encoding the AAVS1-T2 recognition sequence as described below. Incubate the reaction in a thermocycler at 37°C for 30 min and 95°C for 5 min, and then allow the sample to slowly cool to 25°C by ramping down by 5°C per min.\n         \ntable:\n﻿0,1\nReagent,Amount (µl)\n100 µM AAVS1T2_eSpCas9_S,1\n100 µM AAVS1T2_eSpCas9_AS,1\n10× T4 ligation buffer,1\nT4 polynucleotide kinase,0.5\nH2O,Adjust volume to 10 µl",

Inactivate the reaction at 65°C for 10 min\nThe completed ligation reaction can be kept at –20°C until further use.\n11. Warm SOC medium to 37°C and place the transformation cuvette and cuvette holder on ice.\n12. Add 1 µl ligation product to 50 µl electrocompetent XL1-Blue E. coli cells.\n13. Immediately transfer ligation and E. coli mixture to the 2-mm electroporation cuvette.\n14. Quickly slide the cuvette into the shocking chamber of the Gene Pulser II electroporator using the cold cuvette rack. Be sure to dry the cuvette and rack before pulsing the cells.\n15. Apply an electrical field of 2.5 kV, with a capacitance of 25 µF and a time constant of 5 ms, to the competent cells in order to create pores in the cell walls through which the ligation product can pass.\n16. Quickly add 1 ml warm SOC medium to the transformed cells, transfer to 15-ml conical tube, and incubate the transformed cells while shaking (225 rpm) at 37°C for 1 hr.\nDo not fully close the cap of the conical tube during the incubation.\n17. Evenly spread 100 µl transformed cells on an LB agar plate (100 µg ampicillin/ml LB agar) using a sterile spreading device.\n18. Incubate the agar plate upside down at 37°C overnight.\nThe agar plate containing the bacterial colonies can be stored at 4°C for 2-3 weeks.",
    "19. Pick six to eight colonies using a sterile toothpick or pipette tip and place each into 5 ml LB medium with antibiotic (100 µg ampicillin/ml medium). Swirl, cover with a sterile lid, and incubate overnight at 37°C while shaking.\nThe ligation of short oligonucleotide fragments can be inefficient; there may be few colonies that have grown or few colonies with the correct insert. It may thus be necessary to pick more than 6-8 colonies before finding one with the correct insert sequence.\n20. Isolate plasmid DNA from the bacterial culture using a miniprep kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Expect an extracted plasmid concentration ranging from 100 to 400 ng/µl.\n21. Confirm the successful insertion of the annealed oligonucleotides by qPCR, performed as described below using thin-wall 96-well skirted PCR plates with adhesive seals and a CFX Opus 96 Real-Time System. Include non-transformed empty vector as negative control, plus non-template controls (NTC). If samples amplify, run those samples on an agarose gel (2% agarose/TAE) to verify their size. Run the gel in 1× TAE buffer in a horizontal gel electrophoresis chamber at 130 V for 1 hr. If PCR products are the expected size (255 bp), send the vector for Sanger sequencing verification. A simplified plasmid map of the eSpCas9(1.1) vector including the AAVS1-T2 gRNA sequence is illustrated in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.635#cpz1635-fig-0002], panel B′.

    "This vector is verified by qPCR instead of restriction enzyme digestion because the oligonucleotide insert is only 20 bp long and does not contain unique restriction enzyme recognition sites; thus, any size difference in the successfully cloned vector will be difficult to visualize on a gel.\n22. Once sequence is verified, inoculate a liquid culture of the bacteria containing the correct vector in 50-250 ml (depending on the plasmid isolation kit size) LB medium with antibiotic (100 µg ampicillin/ml medium) overnight at 37°C while shaking. Use the liquid culture to isolate the pAAVS1-P-MCS AAVS1-T2 plasmid DNA using a midiprep or maxiprep plasmid isolation kit, following the manufacturer's instructions.\nMidipreps and maxipreps produce greater amounts than minipreps of high-quality plasmid, which can be used in downstream transfections.\n(2a) Plasmid preparation for double plasmid transfection: Cloning Ef1a-HTLV promoter into vector backbone containing AAVS1 homology arms\n23.

    "It is a good idea to create glycerol stocks of your stock plasmid-containing bacteria. Once the cloning has been verified, take 500 µl of liquid culture and mix 1:1 with 50% sterile glycerol in a screw-cap tube. Mix well and store at −80°C.\n25.

    "69. Using the second well, begin the antibiotic selection process of cells that have incorporated a stable genomic integration of donor DNA: Remove the transfection medium and apply standard StemMACs™ iPS-Brew XF medium containing 500 ng/ml puromycin.\nThe appropriate puromycin concentration may need to be optimized for each new cell line. Grow non-transfected cells to 60% confluency in at least six wells of a 24-well plate. Make at least six dilutions of the antibiotic in the appropriate cell culture medium. Maintain cells in the antibiotic medium for at least 1 week. Choose the minimum antibiotic concentration that results in complete cell death within 7-10 days.\n70. Change the selection medium every 2 days.\n71. Once most cells have died and only a few healthy clusters remain, count the remaining cells with a standard cell culture microscope.\nA low transfection efficiency, resulting in 10-30 clones per well, is expected. If cells are not dying within 3-4 days, split the transfected cells as described above into four wells. Immediately continue applying the selection medium.\nThe antibiotic-selected cells should be allowed to grow long enough to ensure that they are healthy and strong, but not too long, to avoid having too many duplicate cells in the single-cell dilution. This leads to the screening of the same clones, which can be time-consuming. However, retaining some duplicate clones is not a bad strategy, because not all cells will survive the monoclonal selection process.\n72. Wash cells with PBS.\n73. Incubate the cells with Accutase at 37°C for 5 min. Collect the detached cells in a 15-ml conical tube and centrifuge 3 min at 250 × g, room temperature.",

Change the monoclonal selection medium every 3 days by carefully aspirating the old medium and replacing with 100 µl of fresh selection medium. It is more important to avoid disturbing the cells than to remove 100% of the old medium; therefore, just quickly and efficiently aspirate from one corner of the well. Carefully observe the cells to be sure that each well of the 96-well plate does not contain more than 1 colony per well.\n76. Once a cluster of ∼10-20 healthy cells has grown in a well of the 96-well plate, transfer these cells to a well of a Matrigel-coated 24-well plate using EDTA/PBS solution as described in steps 62-64. Include 1 µM Y-27632 ROCK inhibitor and 500 ng/ml puromycin in the fresh splitting medium. It is no longer necessary to use the ClonerR supplement.\nIt can take between ∼5 days and 3 weeks for the individual cells to grow into healthy clusters.

Aspirate the permeabilization buffer and block the cells in immunofluorescence blocking solution for 60 min at room temperature.\n6. Dilute the anti-Gaussia luciferase primary antibody 1:1000 in immunofluorescence blocking solution.\n7. Incubate the cells in 300 µl diluted primary antibody at 4°C overnight. Alternatively, to reduce antibody usage, the coverslips can be removed from the 24-well plate and incubated, cell side down, in 25 µl antibody dilution, placed as dots on Parafilm, at 4°C overnight.",
    "A small-gauge needle can be bent slightly at the tip and used to pry the coverslip from the bottom of the 24-well plate. Once the coverslip is at an angle, tweezers can be used to gently pick up the coverslip and place it upside down on the dot of antibody dilution. Place the Parafilm in a petri dish on top of a wet paper towel. Seal the petri dish with Parafilm so that the antibody dilution does not evaporate overnight.\n8. The next day, carefully transfer the cover slips back into 24-well plates, cell side up, and remove excess antibodies by washing three times, for 10 min each, in PBS.\n9. Dilute the Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies 1:1000 in immunofluorescence blocking solution and incubate at room temperature for 1 hr.\nThis step and all subsequent steps should be carried out in the dark (e.g., with the plates wrapped in aluminum foil) to protect the fluorescent tags.\n10. Aspirate the secondary antibody solution and incubate the cells in 300 nM DAPI, diluted in PBS, for 5 min.\n11. Wash the cover slips three times, for 10 min each, in PBS.\n12. Mount the cover slips on glass microscope slides using 3.2 µl VECTASHIELD™ Antifade Mounting Medium and seal by applying clear nail polish to the perimeter of the cover slip.\n13. Image the cell preparations with a fluorescence microscope and verify that all captured cells express the reporter of interest (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.635#cpz1635-fig-0003]).\nIn this example, DAPI is detected using the excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission of 470 nm. The Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody is detected using the excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission of 515 nm.",
    "This protocol describes how to carry out the insert-confirmation PCR using the extracted gDNA of monoclonal cell lines. The insert-confirmation PCR is necessary to confirm that the donor DNA has indeed been inserted into the AAVS1 safe-harbor locus. This test does not exclude off-target integrations, but only confirms on-target integrations. Here it is essential to design the PCR primers to be 5′ and 3′ of the safe-harbor locus, preferentially completely flanking the homology arm sequences found on the transfection plasmid. If this is not possible, no more than one PCR primer may be found in one of the homology arm sequences, and the other primer must be outside the region of homology-directed repair (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.635#cpz1635-fig-0004]). These rules serve to exclude the accidental amplification of off-target inserted donor DNA sequence. Once clones are identified as containing on-target donor DNA insertions, the PCR products containing the inserts should be Sanger sequenced to verify the amplification of the correct genomic locus.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1999f253-def6-4bc7-ae44-94d579f36cc4/cpz1635-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nExemplary images of monoclonal and polyclonal transfected cells, as determined by immunofluorescence.

    "This protocol describes how to prepare the control plasmids for the dc-qcnPCR, organize the qPCR of the gDNA extracted from the monoclonal cell lines, and calculate and interpret the results of the dc-qcnPCR. It is necessary to have at least one control plasmid that contains the sequences of the donor DNA, an autosomal gene, and a ChrX gene (in the following Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.635#cpz1635-prot-0005], these sequences are specifically GLuc, CHOP, and RBBP7, as explained in detail below). To double-check the quality of the control plasmid, it is reasonable to prepare a second plasmid containing the sequences of the donor DNA, the same autosomal gene, and a different ChrX gene. In the following protocol, these sequences are described as GLuc, CHOP, and HPRT1 specifically. Thus, segments of the autosomal gene DNA damage inducible transcript 3 (CHOP) and the ChrX genes hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1) or RB binding protein 7, chromatin remodeling factor (RBBP7) are included in the control plasmids. Both plasmids can be analyzed separately by qPCR. The qPCR plate will include the amplification of each control plasmid using the primer sets for the donor DNA (GLuc), the autosomal gene (CHOP), and the appropriate ChrX gene (HPRT1 or RBBP7). The qPCR plate will also include the gDNA extracted from the monoclonal cell lines of interest, which will also be amplified using the primer sets for the donor DNA (GLuc), the autosomal gene (CHOP), and the appropriate ChrX gene (HPRT1 or RBBP7). The ChrX control is most useful in the monoclonal cell lines if they are male-derived cells, and therefore should have one copy of the selected gene. If the cell line is female-derived, the copy number should be equal to that of the autosomal gene and the detection of a single copy number difference cannot be calculated.",
    "Therefore, it is also recommended that high-quality gDNA from a female and a male be included on the qPCR plate, which should be amplified using the primer sets from the autosomal gene and the appropriate ChrX gene. These data can be used as a control to verify that the method calculates the correct ratio of ChrX genes in females and males as 2:1 (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.635#cpz1635-fig-0005]).",

Dilute the control plasmid(s) designed in step 25 in a 1:10 dilution series of five samples, starting with a 1:1000 dilution.\n27. Amplify each of the diluted plasmids with the primer sets for GLuc, CHOP, HPRT1, and RBBP7 (see Table 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.635#cpz1635-tbl-0004] for sequences and expected product sizes), as well as one exemplary gDNA extraction from a monoclonal cell line, according to the tables below using thin-wall 96-well skirted PCR plates with adhesive seals and a CFX Opus 96 Real-Time System.\n         \nReaction components:\ntable:\n﻿0,1\nReagent,Amount\n2× SYBR Green Master Mix,5 µl\n10 µM forward primer,0.25 µl\n10 µM reverse primer,0.25 µl\nDilution of mini-prepped plasmid or 10 ng/µl gDNA,1 µl\nH2O,Adjust volume to 10 µl\nqPCR protocol:\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nStep,Duration (sec),Temperature,Step\n1,600 sec,95°C,(denaturation)\n40 cycles of:,20 sec,95°C,(denaturation)\n,20 sec,60°C,(annealing)\n,20 sec,72°C,(extension)\n1,10 sec,95°C,(melting curve)\nRamp-up:,5 sec/step,65°C to 95°C,(melting curve)\n28.

For each of these sequences, include the control plasmids (Control-HPRT1 and Control-RBBP7), the samples under investigation, and non-template controls (see Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.635#cpz1635-fig-0006] for example plate layout).",
    "It is also helpful to include high-quality gDNA controls derived from male and female samples (we used control HapMap gDNA samples) and to analyze these samples with the CHOP and RBBP7/HPRT1 primer sets. This provides an additional control to verify the expected ChrX ratio of 2:1 in females/males. These samples do not need to be included in the GLuc measurement because luciferase is not encoded in the human genome.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f47f5ab7-cef5-4735-b212-c873aff0b018/cpz1635-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\nSchematic of Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.635#cpz1635-prot-0005]. Part 1: Illustration depicting the creation of necessary control plasmids, incorporating the donor DNA sequence (GLuc), an autosomal gene sequence (CHOP), and 2 examples of ChrX sequences (RBBP7, HPRT1). When testing the tool for the first time, it is a good idea to prepare two control plasmids in order to double-check consistent amplification between the plasmids and the genomic DNA. For final experiments it is only necessary to use one control plasmid in the subsequent dc-qcnPCR. Part 2: Illustrated table indicating which plasmid or sample to include in which PCR reaction. All clones, gDNA male/female controls, and plasmids should be included in the autosomal sequence amplification. All clones and gDNA male/female controls, as well as the specific ChrX target plasmid, should be included in the ChrX sequence amplification. All clones and control plasmids should be included in the donor DNA amplification. If the donor DNA sequence is not expected to occur in non-transfected cells, do not include the male/female control gDNA.

    "Always check the melting curve and PCR products on a gel to make sure that the expected product is being amplified.\n31. Collect Ct values for each sample and sequence and normalize the sample amplification to the plasmid amplification within each gene.

The calculations in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.635#cpz1635-prot-0005], steps 31 and 32, allow the primer efficiency of each primer set to be normalized by comparing each gene of interest within the same plasmid (equation 1). The normalization relative to CHOP designates which Ct value, within each sample, equals 2, because autosomal genes possess two alleles (equation 2). The normalization of RBBP7 to CHOP verifies that the ChrX gene equals 2 in females and 1 in males. Female and male gDNA should always be included as a positive control during qPCR analyses (Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.635#cpz1635-fig-0007]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/fd2edecf-28c8-4455-ae41-574cded00089/cpz1635-fig-0007-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 7",
    "Example of plate layout for dc-qcnPCR. Samples are prepared in triplicate. For each genomic fragment of interest, include the clone gDNA and the double-control plasmid (CP). For control purposes, include high-quality gDNA from a male and female in the autosomal and ChrX amplifications. It is unnecessary to include these samples for the amplification of the donor DNA if the sequence is not found in the host genome (samples crossed-out in example). If multiple double-control plasmids are being used, it is only necessary to include them where amplification is expected: Do not include HRPT1 control plasmid in the RBBP7 PCR reaction and vice versa (control plasmids crossed out in these cases)."
