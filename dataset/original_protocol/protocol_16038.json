    "The following in situ ChIA-PET protocol describes step-by-step procedures for preparation of cellular samples and library construction for sequencing on the Illumina platform (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.174#cpz1174-fig-0002]). For convenience, we describe the experimental protocol in two parts: cell crosslinking (Part 1) and library preparation (Part 2). In Part 1, to ensure the capture of long-range chromatin contacts through protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions, we employ a dual crosslinking method, which we describe here for both suspension cells and adherent cells. The dual-crosslinking process uses formaldehyde (FA) and ethylene glycol bis(succinimidylsuccinate) (EGS) to maximize the capture of chromatin interactions that involve DNA-protein and protein-protein contacts participating in chromatin interactions. Formaldehyde forms covalent bonds between DNA and associated proteins, and thus captures DNA-protein interactions, whereas EGS preserves protein-protein interactions by forming relatively weak but long-arm bonds. Although we describe the procedure for cultured cells, the protocols can be adapted for primary cells with minor modification. Once crosslinked, the nuclear conformation is preserved, and the cellular samples can be stored at −80°C for months before proceeding to library construction. In Part 2, we describe detailed steps required for ChIA-PET library construction, which involve cell lysis, nuclei permeabilization, in situ digestion, in situ proximity ligation, chromatin sonication, ChIP enrichment, DNA tagmentation, and PCR amplification, which result in the final in situ ChIA-PET library, ready for high-throughput DNA sequencing.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f6259d4c-0ac5-44be-a7f9-ab938a8d3aaf/cpz1174-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2",
    "Schematic overview of Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.174#cpz1174-prot-0001]. The nuclei isolated from dual-crosslinked cells are permeabilized, and AluI (a four-base-pair cutter of restriction enzyme) is added to the reaction for in situ digestion. Proximity ligation is performed in situ, with a bridge linker after the A-tailing step. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) against a specific protein factor is carried out after sonication of the DNA. The de-crosslinked ChIP DNA is tagmented by Tn5 transposase, and the ChIA-PET library is then amplified by PCR and is ready for sequencing analysis.\nMaterials\nCultured suspension or adhesion cells (1-10 million cells/reaction) and appropriate culture medium\n1% FA-DPBS solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.174#cpz1174-rec-0006])\n2 mM EGS-DPBS solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.174#cpz1174-rec-0005])\nDulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), calcium- and magnesium-free (Gibco, cat. no. 14190-250)\n2.5 M glycine (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.174#cpz1174-rec-0007])\nFormaldehyde (FA; 36% v/v; Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 47608-250ML-F)\n0.1% SDS cell lysis buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.174#cpz1174-rec-0012])\n0.55% SDS solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.174#cpz1174-rec-0013])\ncOmplete™ Mini EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (PI; Roche, cat. no. 11836170001)\n10% Triton X-100, molecular biology grade (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 648464)\n10× CutSmart buffer (New England Biolabs)\nAluI restriction enzyme (NEB, cat. no.

Grow cells to log phase (106 cells/ml maximum density) in a T-75 flask. Measure viability before harvesting by staining an aliquot of the cells with trypan blue and counting cells with a hemocytometer (see Current Protocols article: Phelan & May, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.174#cpz1174-bib-0017]). If viability, as measured by exclusion of the blue dye, is >90%, proceed with the next steps. Otherwise, discard the cells and start over with new cells.\n2a. Freshly prepare the FA-DPBS and EGS-DPBS solution and keep the EGS-DPBS solution in the 37°C incubator to facilitate dissolving of the EGS. Also prepare another bottle of DPBS stored at the 4°C refrigerator for later use.",
    "3a. After cell counting (step 1a), transfer cells and medium from the flasks into either 50-ml conical tubes or centrifuge bottles. Spin down the cells by centrifuging 10 min at 1761 × g (3000 rpm in Eppendorf 5810R), room temperature, remove all supernatant, and add DPBS to resuspend the cell pellet to a final concentration of 107/ml. Transfer 10 million cells to one 1.5 ml Eppendorf DNA LoBind tube and record the cell number.\nUse low-binding tubes to prevent cell loss.\n4a. Spin down the cells 10 min at 1761 × g (3000 rpm in Eppendorf 5810R), room temperature, and remove all supernatant.\n5a. Resuspend the cells in 1 ml of 1% FA-DPBS solution and mix well using a pipette tip. Incubate for 20 min at room temperature with rotation on Intelli-Mixer (F1, 12 rpm).\n6a. Add 2.5 M glycine to a final concentration of 0.2 M (87 µl for 1 ml 1% FA-DBPS solution). Incubate for 10 min at room temperature with rotation on Intelli-Mixer (F1, 12 rpm).\n7a. Centrifuge the samples 10 min at 1223 × g (2500 rpm in Eppendorf 5810R), room temperature. Remove supernatant and resuspend cells in 1 ml DPBS.\n8a. Centrifuge the samples 10 min at 1223 × g (2500 rpm in Eppendorf 5810R), room temperature. Remove supernatant and resuspend cells in 1 ml of 2 mM pre-warmed EGS-DPBS solution (pre-warmed solution in the 37°C incubator, step 1a). Incubate for 45 min at room temperature with rotation on Intelli-Mixer (F1, 12 rpm).\n9a. Add 2.5 M glycine to a final concentration of 0.2 M (87 µl for 1 ml EGS-DPBS solution). Incubate for 10 min at room temperature with rotation on Intelli-Mixer (F1, 12 rpm).",
    "10a. Centrifuge the samples 10 min at 1223 × g (2500 rpm in Eppendorf 5810R), room temperature. Remove supernatant and resuspend cells in 1 ml DPBS. Count the cells with an hemocytometer (see Current Protocols article: Phelan & May, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.174#cpz1174-bib-0017]) to ensure that no significant loss of cells happened during the crosslinking steps.\n11a. Centrifuge the samples 10 min at 1223 × g (2500 rpm in Eppendorf 5810R), room temperature. Remove supernatant.\n12a. Store the cell pellets at −80°C until ready to proceed to Part 2.\nThe crosslinked cells can be stored for months\nCrosslinking procedure for adherent cells\n1b. Grow on tissue culture dishes rather than in flasks to facilitate cell harvesting, and prepare an additional dish for counting the cells. For example, grow cells to a final cell density of 6−10 × 107 per 500 cm² in a TC-treated culture dish. Do not grow cells to confluency. Trypsinize the additional dish (see Current Protocols article: Phelan & May, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.174#cpz1174-bib-0017]), and test for viability by staining with trypan blue and counting cells with a hemocytometer (see Current Protocols article: Phelan & May, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.174#cpz1174-bib-0017]). If viability, as measured by exclusion of the blue dye, is >90%, proceed to next steps with the original dishes. Meanwhile, freshly prepare the FA-DPBS and EGS-DPBS solutions, and keep the EGS-DPBS solution in the 37°C incubator to facilitate dissolving of the EGS in solution (same as described in 2a). Prepare another bottle of DPBS and store it at 4°C.\n2b. Remove the culture dishes from the incubator and place at room temperature on the bench.\n3b. Remove the medium and rinse the monolayer twice with ∼30 ml of room temperature DPBS.",
    "4b. Add 50 ml of room temperature DPBS to each dish, and then add 1.429 ml of 36% formaldehyde (FA) to each dish. Shake the dishes on a Stuart Orbital Shaker for 20 min at room temperature at 90 rpm.\n5b. Add 4.47 ml of 2.5 M glycine (glycine final concentration: 0.2 M) to each dish. Shake the dishes on a Stuart Orbital Shaker for 10 min at room temperature at 90 rpm.\n6b. Remove the FA crosslinking solution and wash once with ∼30 ml room temperature DPBS. Then, as much of the buffer as possible with a pipette.\n7b. Add 50 ml of 2 mM EGS-DPBS solution (pre-warmed solution in the 37°C incubator; see step 1b) to each dish and shake for 45 min at room temperature at 90 rpm on a Stuart Orbital Shaker.\n8b. Add 4.47 ml of 2.5 M glycine (glycine final concentration: 0.2 M) to each dish. Shake the dishes on a Stuart Orbital Shaker for 10 min at room temperature at 90 rpm.\n9b. Remove the crosslinking solution and rinse the cells twice with 30 ml room temperature DPBS.\n10b. Add 30 ml DPBS and store the dishes in the cold room (4°C) until ready to harvest.\n11b. Bring dishes to the bench. Discard the 30 ml of DPBS.\n12b. Add 5 ml of pre-chilled (4°C) DPBS (see step 1b), scrape cells with a large scraper, and, for each dish, label a 50-ml collecting tube with date, passage number, and cell type. Collect cells in the 50-ml tubes. Repeat the scraping step twice with 10 ml DPBS to rinse the dishes, and collect these remaining cells into the same 50-ml tube to avoid cell loss.\n13b. Centrifuge the tubes 10 min at 782 × g (2000 rpm in Eppendorf 5810R), 4°C.",
    "14b. Remove supernatant and store the cell pellet at −80°C until ready to proceed to Part 2.\nPart 2: In situ ChIA-PET library construction\nThis section describes the procedures for in situ ChIA-PET library construction (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.174#cpz1174-fig-0002]). It takes around 5 days to generate one in situ ChIA-PET library, and we have divided the protocol steps by day, for convenience. Usually, it will be more efficient and economical to prepare multiple libraries simultaneously. At each major stop point, quality control (QC) measurements are included to evaluate the quality and quantity of chromatin DNA materials (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.174#cpz1174-fig-0003]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b6db4cd7-ee7c-4293-b695-a4d32ff16850/cpz1174-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3",
    "Quality control steps for Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.174#cpz1174-prot-0001]. Critical quality controls for each step are evaluated via Bioanalyzer. (A) QC #1. DNA size distribution profiles of the chromatin DNA after in situ AluI digestion. The distribution usually peaks at around 5-8 kb, as determined by Bioanalyzer profiling. (B) QC #2. DNA size distribution profiles after proximity ligation of the AluI-digested chromatin sample. It is expected that after ligation the size of chromatin DNA fragments would increase accordingly. Indeed, as shown in this sample data, the DNA size observed in QC #2 is approximately 2-5 kb larger than the DNA fragments in QC #1, indicating the proximity ligation was successful. (C) QC #3. DNA size distribution profiles of sonication-sheared chromatin DNA fragments, showing an obvious shift of peak from >10 kb to short chromatin fragments in the range of 2-3 kb. (D) QC #4. After ChIP enrichment, the enriched chromatin DNA is analyzed by Bioanalyzer for quality and quantity. The profile looks the same as in QC #3, as expected. (E) QC #5. DNA size distribution profiles of tagged DNA fragments after tagmentation by the Tn5 transposase step, showing the desired shifting of DNA fragments to the size range of 200-700 bp. (F) QC #6. DNA size distribution profiles of PCR-amplified DNA fragments, showing that the majority of amplicons are in the 300-700 bp range. (G) QC #7. DNA size distribution profiles of the final in situ ChIA-PET library after size selection for the 350-600 bp range, which is the ideal size range for Illumina paired-end-tag sequencing analysis.\nDay 1: Cell lysis, nuclei permeabilization, and in situ restriction digestion",
    "15. Take out a 10 million dual-crosslinked cell pellet tube from the −80°C freezer (step 12a or 14b), leave it on ice for 20 min to thaw the cells, centrifuge the tube 5 min at 2500 × g, 4°C, and discard the DPBS buffer.\n16. Prepare 10 ml of 0.1% SDS cell lysis buffer and 10 ml of 0.55% SDS solution in two separate 15-ml tubes. Add one cOmplete™, Mini, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor (PI) Cocktail tablet to each of the tubes, and dissolve completely. Leave the 0.1% SDS cell lysis buffer tube on ice and the 0.55% SDS solution tube at room temperature.\n17. Resuspend the cell pellet (step 15) with 1 ml of the 0.1% SDS cell lysis buffer (plus protease inhibitors) on ice. Incubate the tube for 1 hr at 4°C with rotation.\n18. Centrifuge the tube 5 min at 2500 × g, 4°C, and then carefully discard the supernatant.\n19. Resuspend the cell pellet with 100 µl of the 0.55% SDS solution (plus protease inhibitors).\n20. Incubate the tube at room temperature for 10 min and then at 62°C in a ThermoMixer for 10 min, followed by an incubation at 37°C for 10 min.\nThe purpose of this step is to permeabilize the nuclear membranes, which will facilitate the entry of enzymes and reagents into the nuclear space for the following in situ digestion and ligation steps. The incubation temperature and duration can be modified according to the cell type used. These suggested parameters have been tested for Drosophila cells (S2 and KC167 cell) and a number of human cell lines for the ENCODE phase 4 Project (e.g., GM12878, MCF7, among others).",
    "21. Add 270 µl of double-distilled water (ddH2O) and 50 µl of 10% Triton X-100 solution to the tube and mix well. Incubate the tube at 37°C for 15 min to quench SDS.\n22. Add 50 µl of 10× NEB CutSmart buffer and 30 µl of AluI restriction enzyme.\nThe tube will now have a final volume of 500 µl.\n23. Incubate the tube overnight with shaking on an Intelli-Mixer (UU, 35 rpm mode) in a 37°C bench-top incubator.\nDay 2: A-tailing and proximity ligation\n24. Perform the first quality control test (QC #1):\n         \nAfter the overnight AluI digestion (step 23), transfer 10 µl of the digestion sample to a new tube.\nTo that, add 90 µl of TE buffer, pH 8.0, and 5 µl of proteinase K solution, mix, and incubate for 1 hr at 65°C.\nPurify the DNA with QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (following the manufacturer's instructions) and check the DNA profile with a Bioanalyzer 2100 HS DNA chip (see QC1, Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.174#cpz1174-fig-0003]).\nProceed to the next step only if suitable digestion fragments (range around 5-8 kb) are visualized in the Bioanalyzer DNA profile.\n25. Set up an A-tailing reaction on ice. Add the reagents in the order shown below:\n         \n490 µl restriction-digested sample (from step 23)\n11 µl BSA (20 mg/ml)\n11 µl 10 mM dATP\n4 µl 10× CutSmart buffer\n3 µl nuclease-free water\n11 µl Klenow large fragment (3′→5′ exo-)\nTotal: 530 µl.\nIncubate the tube for 1 hr, with rotation, at 37°C.\n26. Leave the sample tube at room temperature. Add proximity ligation reagents in the order shown below:\n         \n530 µl A-tailed sample (from step 25)\n257 µl nuclease-free water\n200 µl NEBNext 5× Quick Ligation Buffer\n3 µl bridge linker (200 ng/µl, see Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.174#cpz1174-prot-0002])\n10 µl T4 DNA ligase\nTotal: 1000 µl.",
    "Mix well and incubate for 1 hr at room temperature. Transfer the tube to the Intelli-Mixer for overnight ligation (F1 rotation mode, 12 rpm) in a 16°C incubator.\nThaw the pre-prepared bridge linker solution gently on ice, and mix well gently. Be sure to add bridge linker and ligase last. Additional details for the design of bridge linker nucleotide sequences and method for linker preparation are described in the Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.174#cpz1174-prot-0002].\n27. In the meantime, to coat the antibody with Dynabeads protein G beads, thoroughly resuspend the protein G beads in the bottle and aliquot 100 µl of protein G beads into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube for the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) step.\n28. Wash the beads three times, each time with 500 µl of cold PBST buffer as follows. Place the microcentrifuge tube on the magnet rack, wait for 1-2 min, and remove the supernatant. Resuspend the beads in 500 µl of cold PBST buffer by vortexing briefly, and repeat washing twice. Finally, re-suspend the beads in 500 µl of cold PBST buffer.\n29. Add 20 µg of antibody to the washed protein G beads from step 28, transfer the tube to the Intelli-Mixer, and incubate the tube at 4°C overnight, with rotation at 12 rpm.\nPrepare the antibody bound to protein G beads ∼ 6-24 hr before the ChIP experiment.\nDay 3: Sonication and ChIP",
    "30. Perform QC step #2: After the overnight chromatin proximity ligation step (step 26), transfer 10 µl from the sample to a new tube and add 90 µl of TE buffer, pH 8.0. Then, add 5 µl of proteinase K solution, mix, and incubate for 1 hr at 65°C. Purify the chromatin DNA with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (following the manufacturer's instructions) and check the DNA profile with a Bioanalyzer 2100 HS DNA chip (see QC2, Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.174#cpz1174-fig-0003]). Proceed to the next step only if suitable ligation fragments are visualized in the DNA profile.\nThe fragment length of ligated DNA should be approximately 2-5 kb larger than the digested DNA fragments in QC #1 (step 24), which is a good indication of a successful ligation.\n31. Spin the sample from step 26 10 min at 5500 × g, 4°C, remove the supernatant, and gently resuspend the cell pellet in 0.5 ml of 0.1% SDS cell lysis buffer (+PI), for sonication.\n32. Shear the chromatin via sonication on ice.\nThe optimal sonication parameters for each individual cell type should be empirically determined (see Strategic Planning).\n33. Centrifuge the sonicated sample 10 min at 6500 × g, 4°C. Transfer the supernatant to a new tube.\n34. Perform QC step #3: Transfer 5 µl of the sample from step 33 to a new tube and add 90 µl of TE buffer, pH 8.0. Then, add 5 µl proteinase K, mix, and incubate at 65°C for 1 hr. Purify the chromatin DNA with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (following the manufacturer's instructions) and check the DNA profile with a Bioanalyzer 2100 HS DNA chip (see QC3, Fig. 3C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.174#cpz1174-fig-0003]).

    "35. Take 100 µl of protein G beads per sample, transfer the beads to a microcentrifuge tube on the magnet rack, wait for 1-2 min, and remove supernatant. Then add 500 µl of cold PBST and vortex briefly to mix well. Place the microcentrifuge tube on the magnet rack again, wait for 1-2 min, and remove supernatant. Add 500 µl of cold PBST buffer and repeat the washing step twice.\n36. Transfer the rest of the supernatant from step 33 to the washed Dynabeads Protein G beads from step 35 and incubate at 4°C for at least 1 hr with rotation on Intelli-Mixer at 12 rpm.\nThis step is for pre-clearing chromatin to reduce nonspecific binding of chromatin materials to the magnetic beads.\n37. Take out the tube of antibody-coated beads from step 29, place the microcentrifuge tubes on the magnet rack, wait for 1-2 min, and remove the supernatant. Add 500 µl of cold PBST and vortex briefly to mix well. Place the microcentrifuge tubes on the magnet rack again, wait for 1-2 min, and remove the supernatant. Add 500 µl of cold PBST buffer and repeat the washing step twice.\n38. Incubate the antibody-coated beads (from step 37) with the pre-cleared chromatin materials (from step 36) overnight with rotation at 4°C.\nDay 4: Wash chromatin DNA on beads after ChIP and reverse crosslinking\n39. Place the tube from step 38 in the magnetic stand and remove supernatant.\n40. Wash the beads three times with 1 ml of 0.1% SDS cell lysis buffer. For each wash, nutate for 5 min Multi-function Rotator at 4°C and centrifuge 1 min at 60 × g (800 rpm in Eppendorf 5424R), 4°C.",
    "41. Wash the beads twice with 1 ml of high-salt buffer. For each wash, nutate for 5 min on Multi-function Rotator at 4°C and spin at 60 × g (800 rpm in Eppendorf 5424R) for 1 min at 4°C.\n42. Wash the beads once with 1 ml of LiCl buffer. Nutate for 5 min on Multi-function Rotator at 4°C and centrifuge 1 min at 60 × g (800 rpm in Eppendorf 5424R), 4°C.\n43. Wash the beads twice with 1 ml of TE buffer, pH 8. For each wash, nutate for 5 min on Multi-function Rotator at 4°C and centrifuge 1 min at 60 × g (800 rpm in Eppendorf 5424R), 4°C.\n44. Elute DNA from the beads. For this, add 200 µl of ChIP elution buffer and incubate the tube in the ThermoMixer at 65°C for 30 min with agitation at 900 rpm.\n45. Place the microcentrifuge tube (from step 44) on the magnet rack, wait for 1-2 min, and transfer the supernatant (200 µl) to a new tube (supernatant tube).\n46. Remove the tube with the beads from the magnetic rack and add 100 µl of buffer EB to re-suspend the beads. Mix well. Place the microcentrifuge tube back on the magnet rack, wait for 1-2 min, and transfer the supernatant (100 µl of EB buffer) to the same “supernatant tube” as in step 45, which has the 200 µl of supernatant solution, for a final volume of ∼300 µl.\n47. Add 10 µl of proteinase K (20 mg/ml) to the mixed solution and proceed to DNA de-crosslinking by incubating the tube in the ThermoMixer at 65°C overnight.\nDay 5: ChIP DNA quantity and quality assessment, Tn5 tagmentation, biotin enrichment, and Illumina library preparation",
    "48. Purify the DNA from step 47 using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (following manufacturer's instructions) and elute DNA twice with 11 µl of buffer EB (final volume ∼20 µl). Take 1 µl of the DNA to measure DNA concentration with Qubit (following the manufacturer's instructions) and calculate the yield of ChIP-DNA.\nRoutinely, we obtain ChIP-DNA in the range of 50-100 ng, depending on the nature of the protein factor and the robustness of the antibody used. In the case of RNAPII ChIA-PET, the yield of ChIP-DNA is usually >50 ng, whereas for CTCF ChIA-PET, the yield of ChIP-DNA is >100 ng.\nStopping point: ChIP DNA can be stored at –20°C for 2 weeks.\n49. Perform QC #4: First, check the ChIP DNA profile of the sample from step 48 with a Bioanalyzer 2100 HS DNA chip (QC4, Fig. 3D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.174#cpz1174-fig-0003]). The profile of the ChIP DNA should look similar to that of the DNA before ChIP enrichment (QC3).\nSecond, perform qPCR to check for ChIP enrichment of a selected specific DNA region (binding region of the protein of interest) in ChIP-DNA. To do so, two pairs of PCR Test Primers for two known target binding sites and one Negative Primer pairs based on a non-target locus are used for ChIP-qPCR. Take 0.1 ng of the ChIP DNA for each of the 3 PCR primer pairs to set up the qPCR reactions (Read, 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.174#cpz1174-bib-0019]) with at least 2 replicates, and use the same amount of non-enriched DNA from step 34 (QC3) as total input control, for a total of 12 qPCR reactions (2 template samples [ChIP-DNA and input DNA] × 3 primer pairs [two for 2 Test primers + one for negative primers] × 2 technical replicates = 12).",
    "After the qPCR reactions are completed, calculate the fold ChIP-enrichment based on qPCR cycle threshold value (Ct) as follows:\n         \nCalculate the average Ct for each primer pair with 2 replicates.\nCalculate the average differential Ct (Δ Ct) for each primer pair using the formula below:\n               formula:\n$$empty$$\nCalculate the Final ΔΔ Ct for each Test Primer ChIP-DNA using formula:\n               formula:\n$$empty$$\nA sample with a final ΔΔ Ct value > 5 is considered a successful ChIP enrichment for protein factors of interest.\nSample data can be found in Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.174#cpz1174-tbl-0001].\nTable 1.\n                Example of qPCR Results from QC #4a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.174#cpz1174-tbl1-note-0001_65]\ntable:\n﻿Unnamed: 0,qPCR Samples,Replicate 1,Replicate 2,Replicate Average,ΔCt,Final ΔCt\nTestPrimer Set1,Input,23.76,23.53,23.645,,\nTestPrimer Set1,ChIP,18.53,18.75,18.64,−5.005,−7.645\nTestPrimer Set2,Input,23.11,23.04,23.075,,\nTestPrimer Set2,ChIP,18.74,18.53,18.635,−4.44,−7.08\nNegative Primer Set,Input,23.26,23.55,23.405,,\nNegative Primer Set,ChIP,26.16,25.93,26.045,2.64,\na Numbers in Replicates are Ct values of PCR results for each test primer set in ChIP-DNA or input samples. Δ Ct: differential Ct value between two Ct numbers (ChIP vs. input or Test primer vs. negative primer). ΔΔ Ct: the final differential Ct values for the fold of ChIP enrichment as determined by ChIP-qPCR analysis after calibration with negative primer. According to our experience, a final ΔΔCt above 5 indicates good target enrichment during the ChIP process, directly reflected by sharp binding peaks of the protein in the genome.\n50. Proceed with tagmentation with ChIP-DNA: Add the following reagents to a new 0.2 ml PCR tube, and mix well with a pipette after each addition:\n         \n___ µl ChIP DNA (add 50 ng)\n25 µl 2× NEXTERA Tagmentation Buffer\n___ µl NEXTERA Transposase enzyme (TDE)\n___ µl nuclease-free water to adjust the final volume\n50 µl total volume.",
    "Add enzyme last and mix well. Adjust the amount of Tn5 transposase enzyme according to the amount of ChIP DNA. In this step, all ChIP-DNA will be used for tagmentation. Usually, a maximum of 50 ng ChIP-DNA is used for each reaction, and 8.5 µl of enzyme is added. The ratio of enzyme and DNA is around 0.17. If the amount of ChIP DNA is less than 50 ng, adjust the enzyme amount to preserve the 0.17 ratio.\n51. Centrifuge briefly to bring solution to the bottom of the tube, incubate the PCR tube at 55°C for 5 min and then at 10°C for 10 min in thermal cycler.\n52. Purify tagmented ChIP DNA from step 51 by using the DNA Clean & Concentrator-5 kit (following the manufacturer's instructions) and elute the DNA with 10 µl of EB buffer.\nStopping point: DNA can be stored at –20°C for 2 weeks.\n53. Perform QC #5: Measure DNA concentration with Qubit and check the DNA profile of the sample from step 52 with a Bioanalyzer 2100 HS DNA chip (QC5, Fig. 3E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.174#cpz1174-fig-0003]).\nThe expected size range of tagmented DNA fragments should be larger than 150 bp and less than 700 bp. Otherwise, the ratio of enzyme to DNA should be empirically adjusted.\nIn the event of ChIP-DNA yield (step 48) more than 50 ng, the remaining ChIP-DNA can also be processed for additional tagmentation reactions according to the abovementioned ratio, by repeating steps 50 to 52. Combine all purified tagmentation ChIP-DNA together in preparation for the biotin-DNA enrichment step.\n54. Equilibrate the M-280 streptavidin Dynabeads to room temperature for 30 min. Then, fully resuspend and transfer 30 µl of the suspended Dynabeads into a new 1.5-ml tube.",
    "55. Place the tube with the beads on the magnetic stand and wait for 1-2 min until the solution is clear. Discard the supernatant and wash twice with 150 µl 2× Binding & Wash buffer.\n56. Resuspend beads in 100 µl iBlock buffer, mix, and incubate at room temperature for 45 min on a rotating Intelli-Mixer (UU, 50 rpm).\n57. Microcentrifuge briefly to bring the solution to the bottom of the tube, place it on the magnet rack, discard the iBlock buffer, and then wash the beads twice with 200 µl of 1× Binding & Wash buffer.\n58. Discard the washing buffer, then add 100 µl of sheared genomic DNA mixture (consisting of 500 ng of genomic DNA in 50 µl nuclease-free water + 50 µl 2× Binding & Washing buffer; see Reagents and Solutions) to the beads. Mix well and incubate on the Intelli-Mixer with rotation for 30 min (UU, 50 rpm) at room temperature.\nThe purpose of this step is to use total genomic DNA fragments to block nonspecific affinity to M-280 beads, thereby increasing the efficiency of specific streptavidin-biotin binding to enrich the tagmented DNA fragments containing the bridge linker with biotin and reducing the nonspecific DNA (non-biotin DNA) binding to the M-280 beads.\n59. Place the tube with the beads and genomic DNA on the magnetic stand and wait for 1-2 min until the solution is clear. Discard the solution with the blocking DNA mixture, taking care not to lose the beads. Add 200 µl of 1× Binding & Wash buffer to the beads and mix well. Discard supernatant and repeat the washing step with 200 µl of 1× Binding & Wash buffer.",
    "60. Pool together all of the tagmented ChIP DNA products from step 52 and bring the volume to 50 µl with nuclease-free water. Then, add an equal volume of 2× Binding & Wash buffer, mix well with the beads from step 59, and incubate at room temperature for 45 min using the Intelli-Mixer (UU, 50 rpm).\n61. Microcentrifuge briefly to bring the solution to the bottom of the tube, place tube on magnetic stand, and wait for 1-2 min until the solution are clear. Discard the supernatant, add 500 µl of 0.5% SDS/2× SSC buffer, and mix well. Place the tube with the beads on the magnetic stand and wait for 1-2 min until the solution is clear. Discard the supernatant and repeat the washing of the beads four times as described above, each time with 500 µl 0.5% SDS/2× SSC buffer.\n62. Microcentrifuge briefly to bring the solution to the bottom of the tube, place tube on magnetic stand, and wait for 1-2 min until the solution is clear. Use a pipette tip to carefully remove and discard the supernatant. Wash the beads by adding 500 µl of 1× Binding & Wash buffer, resuspending the beads, placing the tube with the beads on the magnetic stand, waiting for 1-2 min until the solution is clear, and then carefully removing and discarding the supernatant. Repeat this washing with 500 µl of 1× Binding & Washing buffer once more. Resuspend the washed beads with the immobilized DNA in 30 µl of buffer EB.\n63. Prepare an Illumina library PCR reaction as follows:\n         \n10 µl DNA-coated beads (from step 62)\n5 µl nuclease-free water\n25 µl NEBNext® High-Fidelity 2× PCR Master Mix\n5 µl Index Primer 1 (i5, from Nextera XT Index Kit)",
    "5 µl Index Primer 2 (i7, from Nextera XT Index Kit)\nTotal: 50 µl.\n64. Set up the following PCR run:\n         \nInitial denaturation at 72°C for 3 min, then at 98°C 30 s\n12 cycles of 10 s 98°C → 30 s 63°C → 40 s 72°C\nFinal extension at 72°C for 5 min\nHold at 4°C.\nIn this step, tagmented ChIP DNA fragments immobilized on beads are directly amplified with the specific primer pair i5 and i7 (Nextera XT Index Kit v2 Set A, see Materials) by PCR into a library that is compatible with Illumina sequencing. Note that only 1/3 of the tagmented ChIP DNA from step 51 is used for PCR here.\nHere Nextera transponase enzyme was used for library preparation. In this way, we have to do the extension at 72°C first to fill in the 9-bp DNA gap caused by the enzyme tagmentation step before the denaturation step at 98°C.\n65. While the PCR is running, equilibrate AMPure XP beads to room temperature for 30 min before using.\n66. After the PCR reaction done, transfer the 50 µl of the PCR product to a new tube and place it in the magnetic rack. Fully resuspend the AMPure XP beads by vortexing. Add an equal volume (1:1 ratio) of AMPure beads to the reaction tube in the rack (containing the PCR amplicons) and mix well by pipetting up and down ∼10 times. Incubate the mixture at room temperature for 5 min using the Intelli-Mixer (F8, 30 rpm mode).",
    "67. Microcentrifuge briefly to bring all suspension to the bottom of the tube, put the tube on the magnetic stand, and wait for the solution to clear (∼3-5 min). Discard the supernatant, and then add 200 µl of freshly prepared 80% ethanol to resuspend the beads. Spin down the tube briefly, put the tube back on the magnetic stand, and wait for the solution to clear (∼1-2 min). Remove ethanol and repeat the washing step with 200 µl of 80% ethanol. Let the tube sit on the magnetic stand for 1 min to allow any disturbed beads to settle, and carefully remove any residual ethanol. Leave the tubes open on the magnetic stand to air dry on the bench top for 10 min.\n68. Add 10 µl buffer EB to the tube, vortex, and mix well. Spin down the tube briefly, put the tube on the magnetic stand, and wait for the solution to clear (∼3-5 min). Transfer the clear solution to a new 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube.\n69. Measure the concentration of the PCR product from step 68 with Qubit (following the manufacturer's instructions) and check the DNA profile with a Bioanalyzer 2100 HS DNA chip (see QC6, Fig. 3F[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.174#cpz1174-fig-0003]).\n70. Based on the QC6 results (DNA yield and size profile of PCR product), adjust the number of PCR cycles (12) used in step 64 to as low as 9 cycles or up to 13 cycles, and repeat steps 64-69 to amplify the remaining 20 µl of DNA beads. Pool the purified PCR products together in final volume of 30 µl for at least 100 ng of amplicons before library size selection.\nStopping point: DNA can be stored at -20°C for 2 weeks.",
    "The purpose of this step is to prepare a library with enough amplified ChIP DNA for library sequencing analysis but also avoid over-amplification of ChIP DNA that could lead to high redundancy of DNA fragments in a library. In general, lower cycle numbers (9-10) usually result in high library complexity, but higher cycle numbers (above 14) would result in a low-complexity library and high redundancy in sequencing reads.\n71. Add 10 µl of V1 maker (from BluePippin Cassette Kit) to the library and use BluePippin for DNA size-selection in the range of 300 bp to 600 bp using a 2% agarose gel cassette.\nRefer to the BluePippin's manual for detailed operation instructions.\nUsually, the yield of the final size-selected DNA is around 40-60 ng from the 100 ng input DNA (step 68). An alternate approach for DNA size selection for short DNA fragments (300-600 bp), if BluePippin is not available, is to perform AMPure XP beads purification twice for the PCR product.\n72. Perform the final QC step #7: Measure the DNA concentration of the final library using Qubit and check the DNA size profile with a Bioanalyzer 2100 HS DNA chip (see QC, Fig. 3G[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.174#cpz1174-fig-0003]).\nAt this point, the construction of an in situ ChIA-PET library is complete, and the library is ready for high-throughput sequencing.\n73. Perform paired-end sequencing of an in situ ChIA-PET library with 2 × 150 bp module using an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer according to the manufacturer's instructions.",
    "Most of the DNA templates (300-600 bp) for sequencing within the library are composed of a bridge linker in the middle and two short DNA fragments, one on each side, derived from interacting chromatin loci. Paired-end sequencing is done preferably using a 2 × 150 bp module with the 300-cycle sequencing kit to read the paired-end tags with the bridge linker, to capture chromatin interactions. The sequencing reads are processed by ChIA-PIPE, a fully automated pipeline for comprehensive ChIA-PET data analysis and visualization (Lee et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.174#cpz1174-bib-0009]; see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.174#cpz1174-prot-0003]). For each library, we routinely perform a pilot small-scale sequencing of about 1-10 million reads as a final confirmation of the quality of the in situ ChIA-PET library. The initial pilot sequencing data reveals if most of the reads possess the correct DNA template composition (tag-linker-tag), the degree of library complexity, and whether mapping data for ChIP-enrichment (peaks) and chromatin interactions (loops) are detected at expected genomic loci. Once high quality of the library is confirmed, it can be further sequenced more deeply with the Illumina platform 2 × 150 bp module for at least 200 million reads, for final data production.",
    "In an in situ ChIA-PET experiment, a DNA oligo linker, called the called bridge linker, is used to connect the two interacting chromatin fragments during proximity ligation. The bridge linker is composed of a double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide (18 bp) with a “T” overhang at the 3′ end and phosphorylation at the 5′ end of both strands, and a modified “T” nucleotide with a biotin group in the middle of the top strand.\nimgsrc:/cms/asset/bdbd50d4-8b09-4702-af8a-61d43ed3a05d/cpz1174-gra-0001.png\nDuring proximity ligation, each bridge linker will be ligated to two chromatin fragments, each with an “A” overhang added via the A-tailing reaction after the restriction digestion during chromatin sample preparation. Therefore, during proximity ligation, only the bridge linker and chromatin fragments will be compatible for ligation, whereas self-ligation of bridge linkers and the ligation between chromatin fragments will be prevented. The bridge linkers should be prepared beforehand and can be stored at −20°C for several months.\nMaterials\nDNA oligonucleotides (ordered from IDT or similar, HPLC-purified):\n               \nTop oligo: 5′-/5Phos/CG CGA TAT C/iBIOdT/T ATC TGA CT-3′\nBottom oligo: 5′-/5Phos/GT CAG ATA AGA TAT CGC GT-3′\nTE buffer, pH 8.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no.
