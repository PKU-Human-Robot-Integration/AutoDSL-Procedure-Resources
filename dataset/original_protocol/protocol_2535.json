    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nsgRNA and donor DNA design\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThe protospacers of sgRNA determines the location, efficiency and specify of DNA cleavage by Cas9 for genome editing. Thus, we suggest designing a specific protospacer according to off-target evaluation of putative sgRNA sequences using the sgRNACas9 software.14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14] sgRNAcas9 enables the fast design of sgRNA target sequences with minimized off-target effects by predicting the genome-wide Cas9 potential off-target cleavage sites (POT).\nPrepare the input files for sgRNACas9.\nDownload the gene sequence containing 1,000 bp upstream of start codon from FungiDB (https://fungidb.org/[href=https://fungidb.org/]) in FASTA format.\nDownload the reference genome sequence from FungiDB in FASTA format, for instance, download the genome file of A. niger CBS513.88 from https://fungidb.org/fungidb/app/downloads/release-58/AnigerCBS513-88/fasta/data/[href=https://fungidb.org/fungidb/app/downloads/release-58/AnigerCBS513-88/fasta/data/].\nCritical: Please note that the sgRNACas9 software does not allow any white space in the file name or file path.\nDesign the protospacer sequences using sgRNACas9 with the default parameters.\nChoose the gene sequence file as the input of Target sequence and choose the genome sequence file as the input of Genome sequences (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2168-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. sgRNA design using the sgRNACas9 software\n(A) Operation interface of sgRNACas9.\n(B) The algorithms of appraisal of the off-target risk. OT, off-target, contain all types of off-target sites in the genome. POT, potential off-target, only contain off-targets that are perfect match to the 12 nt seed region of the protospacer and outer segments with mismatched bases. Blue X is represented the mismatched bases.",
    "(C) Output example of sgRNA evaluation of the pyrG gene. sgRID, ID of the predicted protospacer; Start and End, start site and end site of the protospacer; GC, GC content; Risk_evaluation, evaluation of off-target risk; Total_POT, the number of off-targets with and perfect match to the 12-nt seed region and mismatch less than 5; OT, the number of off-targets with mismatch less than 5; 0 M, on target site; 1 M–5 M, off-targets with 1–5 mismatches. PyrG_A_71, located 50-bp upstream of ATG starting codon, was highlighted in bold green.\n(D) sgRNA plasmid construction strategy. The BbsI restriction sites in gray, partial sgRNA scaffolding sequences of psgRNA6.0 and annealing sgRNA oligos are shown.\nThere is no need to change parameters other than mandatory options (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nSelect sgRNA length: 20 nt;\nGC%: 40%–60%;\nSelect appropriate DNA strands: Both DNA strand;\nType of sgRNA: Single sgRNA;\nIf select the sgRNA type as paired-gRNAs (optional), offset distance of gRNAs: min: -2 and max: 32;\nMaximum number of mismatches: 5.\nClick on “Run”.\nPlease find the output file of sgRNAcas9_report.xls in the “Report” folder. An example of the output is shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C.\nSelect protospacer candidates according to the following parameters:\nTo replace the native promoter with Tet-on system, the position of the protospacer is better to be located within a 100-bp window of the upstream of the ATG starting codon (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nTo ensure the genome editing efficiency and specificity, there are some recommended criteria:\nNo POT sites or Risk_evaluation: Best;\nNo more than 4 continuous T/A nucleotides (4,6 nucleotide poly (T) tract acts as a termination signal for RNA pol III);\nHomopolymer sequences (more than 5 continuous A or C or G, more than 6 dinucleotide or trinucleotide repeats);\nNo Type IIS Enzyme restriction sites for GoldenGate cloning.",
    "Critical: The preferred PAM of spCas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes is NGG, but protospacers with PAM of NAG can also be cleaved with lower efficiency.19[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19] To choose a specific protospacer, the off-target evaluation with NAG PAM should be taken in consideration. The definition of OT and POT is shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B. OT is the off-targets with mismatches less than 5 and POT is the off-targets with perfect match to the 12-nt seed region of the sgRNA and mismatches less than 5.\nDesign oligos for sgRNA cloning, based on the selected protospacer sequence (20-nt, without PAM) as follows:\nForward oligo: 5′-cacc-20-nt target sequence-3′.\nReverse oligo: 5′-aaac- reverse complement 20-nt target sequence-3′.\nExample: sgRNA sequence: 5′- GAGTAGTTCGAAGTTTCGACTGG-3′.\n20-nt target sequence PAM.\nForward oligo: 5′-caccGAGTAGTTCGAAGTTTCGAC -3′.\nReverse oligo: 5′-aaacGTCGAAACTTCGAACTACTC -3′.\nDesign oligos for donor DNA PCR amplification, based on the selected protospacer sequence (20-nt, without PAM).\nForward oligo is comprised of 40-nt upstream homologous arm and specific amplified primer sequence for the template.
