  "procedures": [
    "Note: Purify EXOSC10-containing RNA exosomes as described in the complementary protocol, Affinity purification of RNA exosomes from HEK-293 cells (Domanski and LaCava, 2017), or by other means. This assay may also be applied effectively to affinity purified DIS3-3xFLAG as previously described (Domanski et al., 2016). Examples of the manipulations associated with the affinity capture aspects of the following protocol can be viewed in our online video protocol (LaCava et al., 2016). Re-capture of RNA exosomes from the glycerol gradientAfter retrieving the fractions from the gradient, pool together up to two fractions constituting the peak of intact EXOSC10-containing exosomes (up to ~450 μl total volume).Note: If desired, save an aliquot of up to 50 μl (input) for other analyses.Add an equal volume of the recapture solution (see Recipe 1).Pre-wash 10 µl of the anti-FLAG magnetic medium (slurry) twice with 1 ml of recapture solution.Note: Combine 1 ml of recapture solution with the beads slurry and briefly vortex. Pulse-spin the tube in a mini-centrifuge to collect all the solution at the bottom and then place the tube on a magnetic tube rack. Wait until beads are collected at the side of the tube and remove the supernatant (using a pipet or an aspirator). Add additional recapture solution to the beads in the tube and repeat the process for the second wash; after removing the supernatant the beads may be held on ice and are ready for use. Both washing steps can be carried out at room temperature.Transfer diluted fractions from step A2 into a 1.5 ml tube with pre-washed beads.Incubate for 30 min with rotation at 4 °C (cold room). Place on a magnet, wait until the beads are collected at the side of the tube, and remove the supernatant.",
    "Note: The supernatant may be compared to the input by protein staining or Western blot to monitor the extent of exosome depletion.Wash once with 1 ml wash solution (see Recipe 2). Resuspend the affinity medium in 25 µl wash solution.Add 25 µl of the 2x reaction solution (see Recipe 3).Incubate at 37 °C with mixing at 1,000 rpm.Produce a time-course for the reaction by taking 10 µl aliquots at different time points e.g., 0, 2.5, 5, 15 and 30 min. Stop the reactions by adding 10 µl 2x RNA loading buffer (see Recipe 4).Note: This assay should ideally include two controls set up as independent reactions: a) as above, but using the blocked substrate, and b) a mock reaction with affinity medium and reaction solution containing the generic substrate, but no RNA exosomes. Both controls should reveal the presence of intact substrate across the time course, indicating that the preparation and solutions are free from interfering RNase contamination. DIS3 is capable of degrading the 3’-PO4 blocked substrate.Place on a magnet and transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube. Keep on ice.RNA PAGE and gel imagingCast a 20% urea-polyacrylamide 10-well gel accordingly to the manufacturer’s instructions.Pre-run the gel in 1x TBE (see Recipe 5) at 15 W for 15-20 min.Note: The pre-running step clears excess free ions from the gel which affect the electrical current and heat generation. The cassette will warm during the pre-run and run; typical operating temperatures are between 45-60 °C. The heat produced may help maintain the RNA sample in a denatured, single stranded form; this is not expected to be a major variable for small oligo substrates lacking strong secondary structure.Heat the samples at 80 °C for 30 sec and then place on ice. Spin down briefly before loading.",
    "Note: Heating the sample denatures the RNA and dissociates RNA-protein assemblies.Wash the urea out from the wells using a syringe with a bent needle.Load on the gel the entire volume of each sample (20 µl) per well. Run at 15 W until the bromophenol blue tracking dye reaches the first line from the bottom of the plastic gel cassette.Open the cassette and image the gel directly using an appropriately configured imager (SYBR green on Fuji LAS series).Note: The gel does not need to be fixed, washed, or dried prior to imaging. Depending on the level of activity detected, some adjustment of the image brightness/contrast in software, after data collection, may improve visualization."
