    "Culture adherent HCT116 cells in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (glucose 4.5 g/L) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2/95% air atmosphere. Culture suspended DT40 cells at a density of 1 x 105-1 x 106 cells per ml in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% chicken serum and antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 39.5 °C in a humidified 5% CO2/95% air atmosphere. Transfect 8.0 x 105 HCT116 cells (40-60% confluent in 6-well plate) using 1 μg of plasmid DNA, 300 μl of Opti-mem and 10 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for one well according to the manufacturers’ instructions (After the transfection medium is not replaced). To obtain 1.05 x 107 cells transfected cells, electroporate three times 3.5 x 106 DT40 cells with 8 µg plasmid DNA with two pulses at 1,500 V for 15 msec according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Collect approximately 2.0 x 106 HCT116 cells or 4.0 x 106 DT40 cells for further analysis 24 h (HCT116 cell) or 16 h (DT40 cells) after transfection. For this the cells are washed with 1 ml PBS three times, scraped off, centrifuged at 800 x g for 2 min at 4 °C. After this step, samples from HCT116 cells and DT40 cells are treated in the same manner.Remove supernatants of samples, suspend cell pellets in 200 μl buffer A and incubate for 20 min on ice to lyse the cells.Note: The buffer A must NOT contain Z-VAD-fmk as it would inihibit PNGase activity.Clarify cell lysates by centrifugation at 17,800 x g for 10 min at 4 °C and transfer the supernatants to new tubes. Pellets are discarded.",
    "To allow PNGase processing of misfolded proteins, incubate the cell lysates further for various periods (a good starting range would be 4 h) on ice. Remove 40-50 µl aliquots at different times, immediately mix with 40-50 μl of buffer B supplemented with 100 mM DTT (for reduction) and 2 µM Z-VAD-fmk (to inhibit the PNGase) and incubate at 100 °C for 5 min. Separate 10 µl of the samples by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using PVDF membrane and probing with an antibody against the protein of interest. Percentage of SDS-PAGE depends on the molecular weight of the protein of interest. Band intensities can be analyzed and compared to each other by ImageJ or similar programs (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160923/20160923232122_0866.jpgFigure 1. Severely misfolded mutants were more sensitive to endogenous PNGase. A. Chicken EDEM1/2/3 triple KO cells (gEDEM TKO) were described previously (Ninagawa et al., 2015). The indicated myc-tagged hATF6α(C) variants (indicated on the left side of the blots) were transiently expressed in gEDEM-TKO cells and subjected to PNGase sensitivity assay. After the indicated time points the PNGase reaction was stopped and samples analyzed by a 12% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with antibodies against the myc-tag. The data shown represents a single representative experiment out of two repeats. Less folded proteins are more sensitive to PNGase, so partially deglycosylated bands were detected at earlier time points in hATF6α(C)-myct mutants, Δ111-119, 182-194 mutant and Δ219-270 mutant. See Ninagawa et al. (2015) for further proteins’ information. B. The graph shows % intensity of upper band/total band of (A). The band intensity was analyzed by imageJ."
