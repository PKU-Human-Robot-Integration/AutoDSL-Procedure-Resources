For each step, the type of drug or anesthetic used should be modified according to the applicable guidelines.\nNeonatal AAV injection\nTiming: 15 min/animal\nCortical-wide Ca2+ sensor (G-CaMP7.09) expression is induced in neonatal mice via quick AAV injection (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1231-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

The red square indicates a planned two-photon imaging area. (C, ii) The coronal view of the correct injection depth. The tip of the glass pipette stops in the middle of the cortical layer, so that the dye (shown in green) slowly spreads throughout the cortex. (C, iii) Coronal view of a failed injection: too deep injection depth. The pipette tip reaches the lateral ventricles (LV), so the dye quickly spreads in LV. (C, iv) Coronal view of a failed injection: too shallow injection depth. The pipette tip does not penetrate the cortical layer, so the dye accumulates between the skin and the brain tissue.\n(D) Examples of successful injection. The dye spreads throughout the hemisphere and does not leak to the opposite hemisphere after the injection. Red circles indicate the injection point for each pup.",
    "(E and F) Examples of failed injection. (E) The dye did not spread throughout the hemisphere. Red circles indicate the injection point for each pup. (F, i) An example of an injection point that was too deep. The dye was observed at three locations: (a) near the injection point, (b) at the right hemisphere forming a crescent shape, and (c) at the left hemisphere forming a crescent shape. The crescent formation is often observed when the pipette tip reaches the LV. Inset is the magnified view. Dashed line indicates the crescent shape, which is the result of the loaded dye accumulating in LV. (F, ii) An example of an injection point that was too shallow. The tip of the glass pipette did not reach the cortex layer and stayed beneath the skin, causing the AAV solution to accumulate between the skull and the skin, leading to skin swelling. (F, iii) An example of an injection using a pipette with a thick tip. Although the dye spreads throughout the hemisphere, the AAV solution overflows under the skin when the injection pipette is withdrawn because the tip used was too thick.\nSee also Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nOur protocol was not based on a method using a microsyringe pump but on the manual injection method, which was modified from Kim et al. (2013)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3], (2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]), and Murayama and Larkum (2009)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6].\nNote: Neonatal AAV injection can be performed on pups at postnatal days 0–5 (P0-5), although our recommendation is at P1-2 for reproducible results. The difficulty level of the injection increases as the pups’ age progresses because the appropriate time for anesthesia administration is dependent on the pups’ weight when using pups >P3.\nPreparation of AAV, equipment, and working space (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nPrepare AAV at a working concentration.",
    "Thaw the tube of AAV stock on ice.\nDilute AAV with saline or PBS solution. Mostly, our working titer is 1.0 × 1011 to 1.0 × 1013 GC/mL.\nAdd 0.1% (w/v, weight/volume) Fast Green FCF to the AAV solution to help visualize the injected area.\nMaintain the AAV solution on ice until use.\nPrepare the working space.\nPrepare an ice bed, i.e., an icebox filled with ice, and cover it with aluminum foil. The pups are anesthetized by hypothermia by laying them on the ice bed.\nSet the polished glass pipette to the micromanipulator and connect the pipette and a 5-mL syringe with a TygonR laboratory tubing.\nSet a head holder for the pups (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A, i) and the icebox under a stereomicroscope.\nBring pups to the working space.\nPrepare a recovery box with bedding.\nTake half the number of pups from their mother and place them into the recovery box.\nPlace the recovery box onto the heating mat.\nCritical: Prepare a recovery box with bedding from the home cage, which can help increase the survival rate of the pups after injection (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A, vi). Leave at least two pups with their mother during AAV injection. If all pups are taken at once, the mother will neglect them once they are returned. We usually take half of the total number of pups for the first round of injections and keep the rest of the pups with their mother. Then, we perform the next round of injections for the remaining pups. Thus, AAV injection can be performed on all littermates.\nAAV injection in the pups. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]\nAnesthetize a pup by laying it on top of the ice bed for 1–2 min.\nAnesthetize the pup until it does not move.",
    "Optional: When you are working on postnatal day 3–5 pups, it takes more time to anesthetize them, i.e., 3–6 min on the ice bed.\nLoad 4.1–4.2 μL of AAV solution into the glass pipette using a syringe.\nPlace the head of the anesthetized pup in a head holder to inject the pipette perpendicular to the cortical layer.\nRotate the pup’s head slightly in the head holder, so that the injection point is facing up (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B, i).\nCritical: It is important to set the pipette perpendicular to the cortical layer to accurately monitor the depth of the injection point and ensure safe injection. If the pipette is inserted at any other angles, the glass pipette can neither penetrate the skin nor skull and could break.\nNote: Generally, the layer structure of the injection site will not be disrupted by neonatal AAV injection (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B and 5C); however, if this occurs, we recommend avoiding the planned area for two-photon imaging. In our study, we planned to perform two-photon imaging studies in the parietal cortex, including the somatosensory area; thus, we chose the frontal region as the injection site (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C, i).\nManually inject AAV into the cortex (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B–3D, Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1])\nSet the tip of the glass pipette to the surface of the injection point.\nInsert the glass pipette 280–300 μm deep from the surface.",
    "Critical: The injection depth in the brain is critical for the successful spread of the dye/AAV throughout the cortex (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C–3F). If the injection depth is too deep, the tip of the pipette will reach the lateral ventricles (LV), and dye spread in a crescent formation will be observed after injection (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C, iii and 3F, i; Kim et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3], 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). If the depth is too shallow, the tip of the pipette will not reach the cortex and stay just below the skin, causing the AAV solution to accumulate between the skull and the skin, leading to skin swelling (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C, iv and 3F, ii).\nManually inject 4 μL of AAV solution into the cortex at a speed of 4 μL/min by slowly pushing the syringe. If the injection is successful, the green dye slowly spreads throughout the hemisphere (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C, ii and 3D).",
    "Note: The manual injection consists of two shots: the first shot is the injection of a small amount (∼300 nL), and the second shot is the injection of ∼ 3.7 μL of AAV solution (i.e., 100–200 nL solution is left in the pipette). The purpose of the first shot is to check whether the injection depth is correct. When it is correct, the dye is observed as a small dot at the injection site after the administration of the first shot (within 10 seconds after the start of injection, 00:09–00:10 in Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). When a small dot is not observed, slight adjustments should be made to find a better depth at which a small dot of the dye appears following the injection of a small amount of the AAV solution. After confirmation, a second shot with higher volume (3–4 μL) is performed. When the injection is successful, the dye will slowly spread throughout the hemisphere and will not leak into the opposite hemisphere (00:20–00:24 in Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1], Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nNote: The area and brightness of sensor expression across the cortex depend on the volume of AAV solution injected (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). We found that the injection of 4 μL AAV solution per animal achieved consistent results for cortical-wide expression. We did not find any developmental differences between the pups injected with 4 μL of AAV solution and those without. In addition, the injection of the 4 μL AAV solution was effective even at different injection depths. In step 2d-iii, if the initial spread of the injected dye appears to be different, the experimenter can adjust the depth of the injection to find the correct depth.\nWithdraw the glass pipette from the brain.\nRecover the pups.",
    "Remove the pup from the head holder and place it inside the recovery box on top of a heating mat.\nCritical: To avoid low recovery rates, the injection procedure (steps 2a-e) must be performed no longer than 10 min per pup.\nRepeat steps 2a-e for each pup in the recovery box.\nReuse the pipette until it breaks or is clogged.\nGently return the injected pups to their mother with the bedding.\nCritical: Check the temperature of the pup by touching it before returning to its mother. Returning a pup with a low body temperature results in the mother neglecting it, which reduces survival rate. Usually, warming the pups for 10 min inside the heated recovery box is sufficient to achieve the normal body temperature.\nNote: In this protocol, we introduced an AAV solution to the brain by manual injection. This results in the quick completion of the AAV injection for each pup. Quick AAV injection increases the rate of recovery from hypothermia and provides high-throughput results when comparing several sensor conditions.\nNote: We found that the AAV-DJ serotype is useful for wide and dense sensor expression in the cortex. The other option is the AAV8 serotype, which can also be used for wide and dense sensor expression. AAV9 is the third option; however, its expression is sparse compared with that of AAV-DJ or AAV8.\nOptional: You can mix at least two different AAVs for different sensor expressions in one injection. In addition, the combination of transgenic mouse lines and Cre-dependent viral vectors can be used to label specific cell types.\nOptional: This neonatal AAV injection method can be applied not only for calcium indicators but also for any other proteins or indicators of interest, such as voltage indicators or optogenetic tools.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1231-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "The video is played at 4× speed, related to step 2\nMaturation of pups and AAV maturation\nTiming: 3–4 weeks (dependent on experimental design)\nThe injected pups are kept in their home cage until a Ca2+ sensor is expressed in the cortex well.\nWait for a predetermined time to allow the animals to grow and for sufficient G-CaMP7.09 (or your Ca2+ sensor) expression for imaging. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]\nNote: Successful AAV induction in cortical neurons did not affect pup maturation, behavior, or survival. We found that more than 90% of the injected pups matured without any problems.\nOptional: If you use a tamoxifen-induced transgenic line (e.g., Cux2ERT), apply tamoxifen when pups are more than 4 weeks old. Wait for another 2 weeks to allow tamoxifen-induced gene expression.\nTranscranial expression check\nTiming: 30 min/animal\nThe Ca2+ sensor expression is checked using transcranial fluorescent observation. Usually, we wait for 4 weeks to allow the infected cells to express G-CaMP after AAV injection (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nNote: This step confirms whether the neonatal AAV injection worked well by observing the spread of the sensor expression in the cortex and its fluorescence intensity, which correlates with the expression level.\nAnesthetize mice with 0.5–2% isoflurane.\nSet the mouse to the head holder and expose the skull.\nSet the head of the mouse in a head holder.\nShave hair and clean the skin with 70% EtOH.\nSpray local anesthetic to the skin.\nCut the scalp and expose the skull.\nAttach the cut scalp to the left and right sides with surgical tape.\nObserve the sensor fluorescence with fluorescent microscopy.

    "Note: The use of a coverslip keeps the saline solution from drying out or falling off from the skull surface during imaging.\nSet the mouse under fluorescent microscopy and observe the green fluorescence with blue light. If AAV injection is successful, green fluorescence can be observed throughout the hemisphere.\nNote: The wavelength of the excitation light depends on the Ca2+ sensor used. In our study, we used a 465 nm (center wavelength) LED.\nNote: The macro-imaging parameters that will be used to assess the expression level depend on the experimental devices. We recommend systematically recording the fluorescence intensities under several conditions, such as different emission light powers, detector gains, and exposure times during macro-imaging until the experimental conditions are fixed. The optimal macro-imaging conditions should be determined retrospectively from the results of two-photon imaging. We used macro-imaging conditions from an animal that showed dense sensor expression (i.e., cortical-wide expression and high fluorescent intensity) and Ca2+ signals with good signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) in the whole FOV during two-photon imaging.\nCritical: When observing the expression, we confirmed that green fluorescence spread throughout the hemisphere with the appropriate brightness (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). If the brightness is dark, the expression is insufficient.\nStitch up the skin and recover the mouse.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1231-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

(G) The morphology of some G-CaMP7.09-expressing neurons (marked with arrowheads) is disrupted due to the toxicity caused by high titer of AAV.\nScale bars in A, B, and D: 1 mm, C and E: 200 μm, F: 20 μm.\nOptional: Sensor expression can also be observed in a brain slice preparation (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). Successful injection results in a dense and uniform distribution of G-CaMP7.09-expressing neurons in the cortex. We found that 85.1–90.2% of all layer 2/3 (L2/3) excitatory neurons in the injected cortical areas could be labeled through successful injection (Ota et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). If disrupted layers are observed at the injection point, the diameter of the glass pipette used may be too thick. Damaged cells around the injection area indicate that the AAV titer used is too high (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]G).\nMaturation of mice\nTiming: 3–4 weeks (depends on experimental design)\nWait for a predetermined time to allow the animals to grow for craniotomy.\nNote: We usually wait until the mice are more than 6 weeks old.",
    "Craniotomy and head plate implantation\nTiming: 3–5 h/animal\nThe double coverslips and a head plate are implanted to allow two-photon imaging. The surgical operation of the implantation basically follows previously reported protocols. (Please see the following references for more in-depth methodological details: Goldey et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Holtmaat et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Maruoka et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nNote: The location of the cranial window depends on the experimental design (i.e., imaging region, such as frontal or parietal areas). In our study, we planned to perform two-photon imaging in the parietal cortex including the somatosensory area, so we set the center position of the cranial window to 0.7–0.8 mm posterior and 1.5–2.0 mm lateral of the bregma.\nAnesthetize the mouse with an anesthetic of choice (e.g., isoflurane).\nAdminister antibiotic enrofloxacin (5 μg/g body weight) via subcutaneous injection.\nCreate a cranial window large enough for the FOV of the two-photon microscopy.\nSet the head of the mouse in the head holder.\nShave hair from the surgical site and clean the skin with 70% EtOH.\nCover the eyes of the mouse with cream to prevent dryness.\nApply a topical anesthetic to the skin.\nCut the skin and expose the skull.\nClean the exposed skull with a dental etching liquid.\nGently scratch the surface of the skull along the cranial hole using a Bonn Micro Probe, a fine needle (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nNote: Because the FOV of FASHIO-2PM is 3 × 3 mm2, we used a φ4.5 mm coverslip that covered the entire FOV in this study. The cranial hole should be slightly larger than the diameter of the smaller coverslip to accommodate the double coverslip implant.\nDrill a groove along the mark made in step 11-g using a drill.",
    "Note: To avoid heat damage to the brain tissue, we recommend using a drill speed of 1000–5000 rpm. It takes roughly 30–60 min to complete drilling along the large mark (diameter 4.5 mm) of the cranial window. Remove small bone fragments or dust generated during drilling using air duster or suction. We recommend opening the cranial window very gently. The groove for a craniotomy of φ4.5 mm may overlap with the cranium joint, and this can easily cause bleeding if the groove is drilled roughly. Thus, gentle drilling is recommended to prevent bleeding during a large craniotomy.\nApply NRR to the groove, gently remove the island of the grooved skull by lifting it with fine forceps, and expose the dura mater.\nNote: It takes approximately 10–20 min to completely remove the skull with no bleeding. Apply NRR constantly so that when removing the skull, the dura mater can be easily detached. If the skull is removed before the dura mater is detached, bleeding from the dura will occur. If bleeding occurs, rinse the surface of the dura with the NRR solution until it stops.\nRinse the surface of the brain tissue with NRR.\nCritical: The surface of the brain tissue should be kept moist by applying NRR constantly until the completion of the double coverslip implantation. Drying of the surface causes damage to the tissue.\nRemove the exposed dura mater with fine forceps (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).",
    "Note: It is better to leave the dura mater intact because its removal may cause microglial activation in some cases. In our study, transient activation of microglia was observed by removing the dura. This activation peaked at 2 weeks post-surgery and returned to the normal level after up to 6 weeks post-surgery (Ota et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Figures S13A–S13C). We usually wait for more than six weeks to conduct chronic two-photon imaging experiments (Ota et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nIn general, the presence of the dura mater interferes with the efficiency of the two-photon excitation and the collection of emission light from the specimens, which reduces the SNR. Moreover, the excitation time per pixel (called dwell time) is shorter in wide-field and high-speed imaging systems than in conventional two-photon systems. This shortening of dwell time also decreases the SNR. Therefore, the dura mater was removed in our study to improve the SNR.\nImplant the double coverslip on the skull surface (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C–6E).\nRinse the surface of the brain tissue and the double coverslip with NRR.\nPlace the double coverslip onto the cranial hole (place the smaller coverslip into the cranial hole, so that it is in contact with the brain surface, Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]E) and push it slightly to ensure that the brain adheres to the entire area of the small coverslip side (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D, i).\nNote: The edge of the larger coverslip catches on the edge of the skull, preventing the double coverslip from accidentally falling through the cranial hole while pushing it to allow it to entirely adhere to the brain tissue (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]E).\nApply a thin layer of cyanoacrylate adhesive (Aron Alpha) between the edge of the coverslip and the edge of the cranial hole. Allow this to dry for ∼5 min (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D, ii).",
    "Note: The liquid (e.g., brain fluid or NRR) prevents the dental cement from curing. The cyanoacrylate adhesive works with the liquid and allows the surface to dry. This helps to cure the dental cement properly. In addition, the cyanoacrylate adhesive prevents the dental cement solution from leaking into the gap between the coverslip and the cranial hole (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]E).\nSeal the double coverslip to the skull using dental cement, covering the edges of the larger coverslip, and allow it to cure (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D, iii).\nNote: To minimize tissue movement during two-photon imaging, the double coverslip must be fixed so that the surface of the coverslip fully adheres to the brain surface. Therefore, after applying it to the edges of the coverslip and skull, we recommend waiting for the dental cement to fully cure, which approximately takes 10–20 min (depending on the solution used).\nImplant a stainless head plate to the skull.\nPlace a stainless head plate (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]F) on the skull and adjust the angle horizontally to the surface of the coverslips.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1231-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.
