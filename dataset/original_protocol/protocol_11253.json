    "All animal studies are approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania.\n1. T Cell Activation, Transduction, and Expansion\nActivate fresh or cryopreserved primary human T cells by mixing with anti CD3/CD28 magnetic beads (e.g., dynabeads) at a ratio of 3 beads per T cell in 6-well cell culture dishes. Culture T cells in X-VIVO 15 medium supplemented with 5% normal human AB serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 20 mM HEPES, and IL2 (100 units/mL). Maintain T cells at a concentration of 106 T cells/mL during expansion. Culture T cells at 37 °C, 20% O2, and 95% humidity with 5% CO2.\nAfter overnight stimulation, add lentiviral supernatant to activated T cells. Calculate the volume of supernatant necessary to achieve a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3−5.\nNOTE: The CD19-BBζ CAR lentivirus plasmid consists of a CD8 hinge, 4-1BB costimulatory domain, and CD3ζ signaling domain21. CD19-BBζ lentiviral supernatant was generated as previously described21.\nOn day 3, collect a representative aliquot of cells for cryopreservation. Prior to cryopreservation, remove the magnetic beads by gentle pipetting and magnetic separation. Prepare freezing medium containing phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and store in 4 °C until use.\n\t\nCentrifuge T cells at 300 x g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and add 5 mL of PBS. Centrifuge cells at 300 x g for 5 min and discard the PBS.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of cold cryopreservation medium. Freeze T cells in a chilled freezing container and store at -80 °C for 48 h. Transfer the frozen cells to liquid nitrogen.",
    "Wash the rest of the T cells once in 5 mL of PBS to eliminate residual vector. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min. Decant the PBS and resuspend the cell pellet in T cell culture medium at a concentration of 0.5 x 106 cells/mL.\nSplit the T cells into two cultures, designated for day 5 and day 9. Count T cells by flow cytometry using counting beads (Table of Materials) and monoclonal antibodies to human CD4 and CD8, as well as a viability dye (Table of Materials).\n\t\nTo measure T cell concentration, prepare a master mix containing 500 µL of PBS, 5 µL of counting beads, 10 µL of 7-Amino-actinomycin D cell viability solution, 4 µL of CD4-FITC and 4 µL of CD8-APC. Add 40 µL of T cells to the master mix and measure cell concentration by flow cytometry based on number of live T cells/bead counts. Refeed to maintain the cultures at a concentration of 0.5 x 106 cells/mL every other day.\nOn day 5, count and cryopreserve day 5 cultures as described in steps 1.3 and 1.5.\nOn day 7, wash 0.5 x 106 T cells in PBS and resuspend in 100 µL of fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer. Detect CAR surface protein expression by immunostaining with a fluorescently-conjugated anti-CAR19 idiotype by flow cytometry.\nOn day 9, count day 9 cultures and cryopreserve as described in step 1.3.\n2. Phenotypic Assessment of T Cell Differentiation\nPrepare a master mix containing pre-titrated antibodies for anti-CD3–BV605 (clone OKT3), anti-CD14–Pacific Blue (PB) (clone HCD14), anti-CD19–PB (clone HIB19), anti-CD4–BV510 (clone OKT4), anti-CD8–H7APC (clone SK1), anti-CCR7–FITC (clone 150503), anti-CD45RO–PE (clone UCHL1), anti-CD27–PE-Cy7 (clone 1A4CD27), anti-CD95–PerCP-Cy5.5 (Clone DX2), and anti-CAR19-APC.\nPrepare individual fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls for anti-CD45RO–PE, anti-CCR7–FITC, anti-CD27–PE-Cy7 and anti-CD95–PerCP-Cy5.5 to distinguish positively stained cells from background.",
    "Prepare dead cell staining solution by diluting live/dead stock reagent (Table of Materials) 1:10,000 in PBS.\nThaw day 3, day 5, and day 9 T cells that were previously cryopreserved. Centrifuge 1 x 106 T cells from each group at 300 x g for 3 min. Discard the supernatant. Wash the cells once with PBS. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 3 min and discard the PBS.\nMix T cells with dead staining solution for 15 min at room temperature (RT), protected from the light.\nAdd 1 mL of FACS buffer to quench the dead cell staining dye. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 3 min, discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 100 µL of FACS buffer containing the antibody cocktail described in step 2.1 and 2.2. Incubate for 1 h at 4 °C.\nAdd 1 mL of FACS buffer and centrifuge at 300 x g for 3 min to wash off unbound antibody. Repeat three times with FACS buffer.\nResuspend cells in 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and store at 4 °C.\nAs CD45RO expression decreases after fixation, analyze the samples by flow cytometry after immunostaining. To assess differentiation, gate in the following order: singlets (FSC-H vs FSC-A), live CD3+ T cells (Dump [live-dead violet, CD14-PB and CD19-PB vs CD3-BV605], CD4-BV510 vs CD8-APC-H7). In CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, gate on CD45RO-PE vs CCR7-FITC to define naïve-like T cells (CD45RO-CCR7+), Tcm (CD45RO+CCR7+), Tem (CD45RO+CCR7-), and Tte (CD45RO-CCR7-). To identify Tscm, gate on CD27+ T cells in naïve-like T cells population. In this compartment, Tscm are CD95+ and Tn are CD95-.\n3. In Vitro Functional Analysis\nCAR T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion\nVerify CAR expression as well as cell viability as described in steps 1.5 and 1.7, by flow cytometry.",
    "Wash 5 x 106 T cells from each group (day 3, day 5 and day 9) with PBS and resuspend in a 1 µM solution of carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) in PBS for 3.5 min at RT.\nImmediately add 10 mL of PBS containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) to quench the reaction.\nCentrifuge the solution at 300 x g for 3 min. Discard the supernatant and repeat this wash step three times. Count the cells at the conclusion of CFSE staining using a Coulter counter (Table of Materials).\nHarvest CFSE-stained cells (unstimulated), resuspend in 1% PFA and store at 4 °C for analysis by flow cytometry.\nIncubate the desired number of CFSE-stained CAR T cells with irradiated K562-CD19 (target) as well as K562-wild type (control) cells at a ratio of 1:1 for 120 h in cytokine free culture medium and culture conditions as described in step 1.1.\nAfter 24 h, centrifuge the culture vessel at 300 x g for 5 min. Collect 120 µL of cellular supernatant. Assess activation-dependent production of IL2, IFNγ, TNFα, GM-CSF, and other inflammatory cytokines (IL1β, IL4, IL5, IL6, IL8, and IL10) by Luminex analyses in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.\nReplace the volume of supernatant that was collected in step 3.1.7 with an equivalent volume (120 µL) of fresh medium.\nOn day 3 (i.e., after 96 h), count and re-feed at a concentration of 0.5 x 106 cells/mL using bead-based flow cytometry as previously in step 1.5.\nOn day 5, count the live CD3+ cells and calculate the fold change of live T cells relative to the live T cell count at day 0.\nPerform a comprehensive analysis of CFSE dilution in dividing CAR T cells using FlowJo software to highlight successive rounds of cell division.",
    "NOTE: Proliferation assays are well described in the FlowJo manual.\nCytotoxicity assay\nNOTE: The ability of CART19 cells to kill target cells expressing CD19 is evaluated using a 51Cr release-assay.\n\t\nLabel the target cells by mixing 5 x 105 K562-CD19, K562-wild type control cells, or NALM6 leukemia cells with 50 µL of Na251CrO4 and 0.5 mL of RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS for 90 min in the incubator at 37 °C.\nCentrifuge cells at 300 x g for 2.5 min. Discard the radioactive supernatant in appropriate disposal bins and wash the target cells in 5 mL of PBS. Repeat the wash steps twice.\nResuspend the target cells in phenol red-free medium containing 5% FBS. Use this medium for the rest of the procedure to reduce background.\nAfter evaluating CAR expression and cell viability by flow cytometry (as described in section 5.1), mix CAR T cells with labeled target cells at effector:target (E:T) ratios of 10:1, 3:1 and 1:1, in triplicate. Transfer to a 96-well U bottom plate.\nIn parallel, include target cells alone, and target cells with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), to determine spontaneous (S) and maximum (M) 51Cr release, respectively.\nCentrifuge cells at 300 x g for 5 min and incubate for 4 h or 20 h in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2.\nAfter the designated time, centrifuge the culture vessel at 300 x g for 5 min. Collect 35 µL of cellular supernatant and transfer to a reader plate. Avoid bubbles. Let the plate dry overnight.",
    "Seal the plate with a standard plate seal and count with a liquid scintillation counter. Chromium abundance in the supernatant provides a proxy of target cell killing. Calculate the percentage of specific lysis as follows: 100 x (counts per minute [cpm] experimental release – cpm S release)/ (cpm M release – cpm S release).\n4. In Vivo Functional Analysis\nObtain 6−10-week-old NOD-SCID γc–/– (NSG) mice, which lack an adaptive immune system, and assign them to treatment/control group randomly.\nInject animals intravenously via tail vein with 1 x 106 NALM6 cells in 0.1 mL sterile PBS.\nAfter 5−7 days, confirm tumor engraftment by bioluminescence imaging (BLI). Inject 150 mg/kg of D-luciferin to mice which have been anesthetized with isoflurane (volume is dependent on body mass).\nMeasure bioluminescence values using an imaging system. Quantify total flux using the corresponding software by drawing rectangles of identical area around mice, reaching from head to 50% of the tail length. Subtract the background for each image individually.\nAfter establishing leukemia, inject 3 x 106 day 9 CART19 cells, 0.5 x 106 day 3 CAR T cells, or corresponding non-transduced (NTD) human T cells via tail vein in a volume of 100 µL of sterile PBS/Ca2+.\nNOTE: As the bioactivity of cells harvested at various intervals during the culture process is different, the chosen concentration of day 3 cells is lower than day 9.\nTo determine disease progression, measure the bioluminescence values twice a week as described above in step 4.3.\nTo determine CAR T cell engraftment, collect 75 µL blood via retro-orbital bleeding in an EDTA-coated tube. Transfer 50 µL of blood to absolute counting tubes.",
    "Stain blood with antibodies against CD45, CD4, CD8 and CAR for 30 min at RT. Add 400 µL of 1x FACS lysing solution to the tubes and vortex thoroughly. After staining, analyze surface marker expression by flow cytometry.\nNOTE: Other surface markers can be used to assess the differentiation and exhaustion status of the T cells in blood.\nTo measure cytokines levels in blood, centrifuge blood at 1,200 x g for 30 min at 4 °C to separate serum from the upper layer of blood.\nCollect serum and measure the cytokines with a designated reader plate according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nSubscription Required.
