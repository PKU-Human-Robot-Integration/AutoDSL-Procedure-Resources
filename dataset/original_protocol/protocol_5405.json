    "Yeast cultures were grown on YPD or selective media. In the morning dilute night culture till OD600 = 0.15. Grow 100 ml of culture at 30 °C until OD600 = 0.6-0.8.To keep the polysomes add cycloheximide (CHX) till final concentration 0.1 mg/ml and incubate 10 min on ice.Spin the cells for 5 min at 4,000 x g and wash with 50 ml of cold water containing 0.1 mg/ml of CHX. Resuspend the pellets in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml of CHX, spin. Cells can be frozen and stored at -20 °C. Work on ice! Resuspend the pellet in 0.4 ml of buffer A, add 0.5 ml of glass beads and disrupt 15 min on the glass bead beater at 4 °C.To avoid the contamination with cells derby preclean the total extracts. For this transfer the liquid phase into the new tube. Centrifuge 1 min 16,000 x g at 4 °C.Transfer the supernatant into the new eppendorf tube and centrifuge 10 min 16,000 x g at 4 °C.Measure the total protein concentrations in the supernatants [= TE (Total Extracts)]. For this dilute the total extracts 1:20 and load 5 and 10 μl to the Bradford sample (0.8 ml of water and 0.2 ml of Bradford reactive). Note: Lysate should be fresh, they can not be frozen! Pour 12 ml gradients (7 to 47% sucrose) using Density Gradient Fractionation System (ISCO) (Figure 2). Gradients are best poured at the night before the centrifugation. Keep the gradients at 4 °C before loading samples. Balance gradient volumes in paired rotor buckets firstly by eye, carefully removing some of top of gradient using a pipette tip if necessary. Check with the balance.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20120609/20120609125353_4443.gif Figure 2. Preparation of sucrose density gradients for polysome analysis.",
    "6 ml of 7% (marked in blue)and 6 ml of 47% (marked in pink) sucrose solutions are placed into the frontand back compartments of a gradient pourer, respectively. A small magnetic fleais used to mix the solution in the front compartment, which is drained slowly usinga peristaltic pump to the bottom of the centrifuge tube (approx 10 min per gradient).Care should be taken to minimize the mixing in the centrifuge tube. Load 0.2 ml of the total extracts containing 2-4 mg of total protein on the top of 7-47% sucrose gradient without disturbing the surface. Note: Do not load more than 0.25 ml of the total extracts! Centrifuge for 150 min at 220,000 x g (39,000 rpm for rotor SW41) at 4 °C.Before spin is complete, set up to analyze gradient(s). Standardize absorbance detector with a 1x buffer B. Set baseline according to the Instruction Manual.Note: Before putting first gradient on make sure the pump line is filled with foni-inert so that no bubbles can enter sample - this will destroy the gradient! Try briefly raising the needle and running 1 ml of foni-inert into the base cup just prior to first fractionation. Carefully remove gradients and store at 4 °C without disturbing. Gradients must be fractionated before they start to diffuse. Insert first gradient snugly into top of fractionator [Density Gradient Fractionation System (ISCO)] and raise lower platform to base of tube, and screw-lock. Slowly screw up needle into bottom of gradient tube (Figure 3). Run the pump.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20120609/20120609125521_0262.gif Figure 3. Fractionation of polysome gradients. Pierce the tube with theneedle. Using a peristaltic pump, extrude the gradient from the tube with afoni-inert through a spectrophotometer that monitors the absorbance at 254 nm,and then fractionated into eppendorf tubes.",
    "End run when first droplets of foni-inert are collected at end of gradient, then put the pump in the reverse mode and pump back most of the foni-inert for reuse. Be careful that no new air bubbles are introduced into pump line and needle during this procedure.Clean up after fractionating all parts of the gradient fractionation system. Rinse entire system with water, then with 20% ethanol. Clean up bench and equipment. Discard waste solutions and trash.Density Gradient Fractionation System (ISCO)Isco Type 6 Optical Unit:Use 254 nm filter and source screenUA-5 Absorbance Detector Settings:Chart Speed: 30-60 cm/hSensitivity: 1.0 or 2.0 (A260 Units = Full scale)Slope Sensitivity = HighPump: Setting 40, clockwiseFraction Collector: (if desired)Use 1.5 ml microfuge tubes inside larger glass tubesCollect 0.4 min drops (0.75 ml)Take 0.4 ml of fraction (the rest freeze) and add 60 μl of 100% TCA, incubate for 10 min on ice.Spin at 16,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.Aspirate all traces of TCA and resuspend the pellets in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. Load 10 μl on SDS-PAGENote: In case of polysomes disruption, polysomes were dissociated by treatment with 25 mM EDTA added instead of CHX, in the buffer A and in the gradient."
