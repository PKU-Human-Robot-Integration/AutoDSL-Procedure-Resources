    "This research study was approved by the McGill Institutional Review Board. All patients provided written consent to participate in the study and to have their FFPE products of conception (POCs) retrieved from various pathology departments.\nNOTE: While there are several methods for genotyping and ploidy determination by flow cytometry, the protocols provided here describe one method of analysis using one platform for each.\n1. Genotyping\nSelection of the best FFPE block\nFor each FFPE product of conception (POC), prepare 4 µm-thick hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections as described in sections 1.2 and 1.3, one for each available block, for morphological evaluation by microscopy.\nUsing the H&E slides and a light microscope, select the FFPE block that has the largest amount of chorionic villi (CV), and if possible, the block that has CV separate from, and not intermingled with, maternal tissues.\nSectioning\nPlace the chosen block on ice for 15 min to facilitate the sectioning.\nAdjust the microtome to cut sections that are 4 µm thick for microscopic morphological evaluation and 10 µm thick for DNA extraction.\nPlace the cold block in the microtome and cut one section from each block for H&E staining and 10−30 sections from the chosen block, depending on the amount of CV in the block, for DNA extraction.\nNOTE: For blocks that are full of CV, 10 sections are sufficient for DNA extraction. If only about 10% of the block contains CV while the rest are maternal tissues, then 20−30 sections are needed to ensure sufficient amounts of DNA.\nUsing forceps, transfer each section to a 45 °C water bath. Pick up the section from the water bath with a positively charged slide (Table of Materials) that is previously labelled with the sample identification number using a pencil.",
    "Place the slides containing the sections in an oven at 65 °C to allow the sections to adhere to the slides. Keep the slides for H&E in the oven for 25 min. Keep the slides for DNA extraction in the oven for 20 min.\nNOTE: The shorter incubation time makes the tissues slightly less adherent to the slides and consequently facilitates the removal of the maternal tissues.\nH&E staining\nAllow the slides to cool down to room temperature (10 min).\nReagent preparation\n\t\t\nPrepare Eosin Y working solution (0.25%) as per Table 1. Mix well and store at room temperature.\nPrepare working hematoxylin solution by diluting stock solution of hematoxylin 5x in water (i.e., mix 80 mL of water with 20 mL of hematoxylin).\nNOTE: Wrap stock solution of hematoxylin in foil for storage.\nPrepare staining jars with the correct reagents under a fume hood according to Table 2.\nPerform the H&E staining by submerging the slides into the appropriate staining jars for the correct time period according to Table 2.\nMount the 4 µm sections for morphological analysis with mounting medium and coverslip with glass coverslips (Table of Materials).\nNOTE: The 10 µm sections for genotyping should not be coverslipped.\nLeave the 10 µm sections under the fume hood for a minimum of 3 h in order for the toxic xylene odors to dissipate.\nCAUTION: All the staining steps need to be performed under a fume hood. Xylene products need to be kept under the hood at all times because xylene odors are toxic. Furthermore, xylene and hematoxylin need to be discarded in special containers. Once these containers are full, they need to be discarded as recommended by the laboratory's safety organization.\ntable:\n﻿0,1\nReagent,Quantity\nEosin Y stock solution (1%),250 mL\n80% Ethanol,750 mL\nGlacial Acetic Acid (Concentrated),5 mL",

This step may need a lot of time and patience, depending on the block, as it requires meticulous attention to details.\nHave a second person double-check the slides after the cleaning to ensure that they are free of maternal tissues.\nTake photos of the cleaned slides or document the following to help with data interpretation: 1) whether the tissue was difficult to clean, hemorrhagic, or very clean, 2) the number of sections used, and 3) the approximate amount of cleaned tissues.\nNOTE: Figure 1 provides an example of a slide that is easy to clean. For a block containing roughly this amount of CV, 10 sections are sufficient for DNA extraction. The slide in Figure 2 has very few CV that are intermingled with maternal tissues, making it very difficult and time-consuming to clean. For a block containing roughly this amount of CV, 30 sections are needed for DNA extraction.",
    "Collect the CV using small moistened pieces of paper wipes. Using the forceps, tear a tiny piece out of the moistened paper wipes and use it to collect the CV.\nPlace the pieces of paper wipes with their attached CV into a labelled 1.5 mL tube.\nMinimize the amount of paper wipes used in this step as too much may clog the DNA extraction column and consequently reduce the final amount of collected DNA. On average, aim to use less than seven small pieces of paper wipes per sample. If that is not possible due to the presence of large quantities of CV, split the sample among two tubes to facilitate the extraction.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60366/60366fig1a.jpg\nFigure 1: Representative slide for genotyping.

From experience, elution with 15 µL of elution buffer works well for most samples. Dilutions may be prepared from the stock DNA as needed.\nDNA quantification\nUsing a lab spectrophotometer device, load 1 µL of DNA and measure absorbance at 260 nm for quantification.",

    "Analyze the data with a DNA fragment analysis software and compare the POC alleles to the parental alleles to determine their origin.\nSet up a size standard.\nNOTE: This allows the software to recognize the ladder that is used in the multiplex STR system, and to assign basepairs to the amplicons based on the ladder. The following steps are for one specific software (Table of Materials) but may be of help for setting up other types of software as well.\n\t\t\nOpen the software. Click on Start New Project and then on New Size Standard.\nGive the size standard a name (e.g., ABI_600).\nIn the box named Enter New Size Standard definition: enter the following: 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 225, 250, 275, 300, 325, 350, 375, 400, 425, 450, 475, 500, 550, 600. Then click on Add Size(s).\n\t\t\tNOTE: The numbers entered will appear under the box on the right, which is named Current Size Standard Definition (see Figure 5).\nClick on Save.\nTo import and analyze a file, click on Add Files, and choose the fsa file to be analyzed. Click on Add Selected Files and then on OK. Then follow these steps:\n\t\t\nLocate the Size Standard column and choose ABI_600 (or whichever name was given to the size standard).\nUnder Analysis Method, click on Sizing Default - NPP and then click on the green Analyze button.\nThe file is now ready for viewing. Adjust the viewing options to view the data as desired.\nTroubleshooting - analysis method\nNOTE: The software may sometimes fail to identify peaks and align them correctly. This happens when the peaks are either too low or too high. The following two analysis methods can correct for this and should be tried before a sample is retested.",
    "Analysis method 1 for high peaks:\n\t\t\t\nClick on New Analysis Method and name it High Peaks (or another name as per personal preference).\nClick on Range and then on Partial Range for the analysis and sizing.

Flow Cytometry\nChoosing the ideal FFPE block\nUsing H&E slides and a light microscope, select an FFPE block that has about 50−70% of its tissues composed of CV.",
    "NOTE: Figure 6 is a representative example of an appropriate block for flow cytometry analysis, as it is composed of roughly 50% CV (right half of the section) and 50% maternal tissues (left half). The presence of maternal tissues is important because they serve as an internal control for the diploid peak.\nFor blocks that do not have the ideal amount of CV, enrich for CV as the sectioning is performed. To do so, identify which side of the freshly cut sections contains more CV according to its corresponding H&E slide. Based on that, use a blade to cut off the other half that needs to be discarded in order to enrich for CV.\nNOTE: Figure 7 shows a block that does not have sufficient CV for flow cytometry analysis. For blocks such as this one, the sections need to be cut such that the half that contains less CV gets discarded in order to increase the amounts of CV with respect to maternal tissues, as shown in the figure. Be sure to cut more sections to compensate for what is discarded.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60366/60366fig6a.jpg\nFigure 6: H&E section representing a POC block that is ideal for flow cytometry.

    "Using the best possible FFPE block, cut four sections that are 50 µm thick (or two 100 µm thick sections) using a microtome.\nNOTE: For flow cytometry it is preferable to have thicker sections.\nIn the case that an ideal FFPE block is not available, aim to maintain the ratio of CV to maternal tissue nonetheless. For example, if only 30% of the block is made up of CV while the rest has maternal tissues, then remove at least half of the section that contains the maternal tissues and use more sections to compensate (see Figure 7).\nPlace the sections in labelled 15 mL tubes.\nNOTE: Be sure to tape over the labels because the organic reagents used in the next step can dissolve and remove ink.\nFlow cytometry protocol from FFPE tissues\nDeparaffinization and rehydration \n\t\t\nPerform the following washes (Table 3) under a fume hood. \nFill the 15 mL tube with 6 mL of the appropriate reagent, following the order presented in Table 3, leave the sections in the reagents for the respective duration, and then remove the reagent using vacuum suction and a glass Pasteur pipette. \nBetween each step, dip the Pasteur pipette first in 70% ethanol, then in distilled water, and then proceed to the next step.\nBe very careful not to remove pieces of tissue along with the reagent. Tilt the 15 mL tube to a 60-degree angle to facilitate suction of the liquid reagent without drawing tissues. \nCAUTION: The discarded liquids contain xylene and should be disposed of in xylene waste containers.\nSolution preparation\n\t\t\nPrepare citrate solution by dissolving 2 g of citric acid in 1 L of double distilled water. Bring the pH to 6. Store at 4 °C.",
    "Prepare pepsin solution by dissolving 0.01 g of pepsin in 2 mL of 9 parts per thousand NaCl, pH 1.64. This is for one sample.\nCAUTION: Pepsin is toxic and can easily disperse and become airborne. Wear a mask when handling pepsin in its powder form and wipe down all of the working area after using it.\nPropidium Iodide (PI)-ribonuclease A solution preparation for one sample.\n\t\t\t\nMix 50 µL of PI with 450 µL of PBS (to dilute 10x).\nAdd 50 µL of ribonuclease A (1 mg/mL) to the mixture. Keep wrapped in foil at all times.\nDigestion and staining\n\t\t\nAdd 4 °C citrate solution to the 15 mL tubes then place in an 80 °C water bath for 2 h.\nLet the solution cool down to room temperature (15 min). Remove the citrate solution.\nAdd 6 mL of 1x PBS, vortex, and wait 1−2 min to allow the tissues to settle to the bottom. Remove the 1x PBS using vacuum suction and a glass Pasteur pipette.\nAdd 1 mL of pepsin solution (preheated to 37 °C) and place in a 37 °C dry bath for 30 min. Vortex every 10 min. Prepare the PI-ribonuclease A solution in the last 10 min of this incubation.\nAdd 6 mL of 1x PBS, vortex, and wait 1−2 min to allow the tissues to settle to the bottom. Remove the 1x PBS using vacuum suction and a glass Pasteur pipette.\nAdd 550 µL of the PI-ribonuclease A solution and place the samples in a 37 °C dry bath for 30 min.\nNOTE: At this point, the samples can be wrapped in foil and left overnight at 4 °C till the next morning.",
    "Filter the solution through a 48-µm filtration mesh. Collect the filtrate in polystyrene round-bottom tubes, which can be used with the flow cytometer. Use forceps to place a 5 cm by 5 cm piece of filtration mesh in the top part of the tube, such that the liquid can be pipetted through the mesh and into the tube. \nNOTE: The samples are now ready to be run with the flow cytometer. Keep them wrapped in foil until they are ready to be run.\nRun samples with a flow cytometer with the help of the organization’s flow cytometry platform technician.\nNOTE: The PE channel is used to detect the PI-stained DNA and the flow rate should be set to Slow during acquisition. Ensure that the voltage is chosen such that the diploid peak is roughly at 200 along the PE-A x-axis to facilitate analysis and interpretation.

Then browse for the same FCS file that was selected for the histogram.\nChange the x-axis of the dot plot to PE-A and the y-axis to PE-W.\nNOTE: Figure 8A demonstrates the appearance of the plots at this point.\nClick on the Region icon (imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60366/60366eq3.jpg) and draw a box on the dot plot that starts before the diploid peak (around 100 on the x-axis in Figure 8B) and that ends around 700 on the x-axis, as shown in the dot plot in Figure 8B.\nNOTE: The diploid peak in Figure 8 is roughly at 200 on the x-axis. This is chosen arbitrarily as the samples are recorded through the flow cytometer, simply to facilitate analysis and interpretation of the results.\nClick on Plot | Edit Regions/Gates, then type R0 in the cell that is next to the G0 cell under Strategy. Then click on Close.\nClick anywhere on the histogram, then on Plot | Format Plot/Overlay. Under Gate, select G0 = R0 and then click on OK.\nNOTE: This is the gating step that allows one to better visualize the ploidy peaks. The histogram should now look like the histogram in Figure 8B.
