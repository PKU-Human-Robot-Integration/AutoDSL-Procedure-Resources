    "The present protocol was approved by the Danish Animal Experiments Inspectorate. All test animals were anesthetized throughout the procedures. Reproduction of this protocol must be carried out in accordance with national ethics and animal welfare guidelines, and approved by local ethics committees.\n1. Animals\nDanish Landrace piglets < 24 hr old weighing approximately 1,500 - 2,000 g.\n2. Anesthesia and Maintenance Fluids\nPrepare the equipment needed for anesthesia (Figure 1): A mask for sevoflurane administration, alcohol swabs, peripheral intravenous catheter, rubber band, syringes with saline, propofol (5 mg/kg), fentanyl (10 µg/kg), and procaine benzylpenicillin (15,000 IU/kg).\nInduce anesthesia by delivering 1-2% sevoflurane through a breathing mask.\n\t\nAssess the depth of anesthesia by assessing for palpebral and withdrawal reflexes. When certain that the piglet is deeply anesthetized, percutaneously insert a peripheral intravenous catheter into the ear vein.\nTo confirm patency of the peripheral intravenous catheter, flush the catheter with 1-2 ml of sterile 0.9% saline. Administer bolus injections of propofol (5 mg/kg) and fentanyl (10 µg/kg). Subsequent to bolus injection administration flush the intravenous catheter a second time using 1-2 ml of sterile 0.9% saline.\nPlace syringes with propofol (10 mg/ml) and fentanyl (10 µg/ml) in two separate syringe infusion pumps. Connect i.v. tubes from the two syringe pumps to a three-way stopcock joining infusions into a single line that is connected to the intravenous catheter. Start continuous i.v. infusion of propofol (4-12 mg/kg/hr) and fentanyl (10 μg/kg/hr). Once continuous infusions are running, do not give further bolus injections of propofol and fentanyl.\nDiscontinue administration of the sevoflurane gas anesthesia.",
    "Inject procaine benzylpenicillin (15,000 IU/kg) subcutaneously or intramuscularly as per local guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis. Repeat daily. The video shows s.c. administration, which in piglets has been shown to result in higher plasma concentration and longer half-life when compared to i.m. administration.\nApply eye lubricant ointment to prevent drying of the eyes. Pull the lower eyelid down gently to form a pocket-like opening. Squeeze a small amount of ointment inside the pocket. Close eye to distribute ointment. Check for dryness hourly and reapply as needed.\nInitiate a continuous rate infusion of 5% dextrose/0.45% NaCl i.v. at 10 ml/kg/hr. Reduce rate to 5 ml/kg/hr during and after hypoxia. Adjust infusion rate to maintain blood glucose levels between 2-10 mmol/L.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52454/52454fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Equipment for anesthesia and intubation.

Intubation and Ventilation\nPrepare the equipment needed for intubation (Figure 1): rocuronium bromide (1 mg/kg) for muscle relaxation, a rope sling (tie both ends of the same 4 mm nylon rope together to form a circle as depicted in Figure 1) for opening the mouth, a cotton tipped swab and veterinary laryngoscope with straight blade, xylocaine spray (100 mg/ml), various sized endotracheal tubes with cuff (sizes 3.0 mm, 2.5 mm, 2.0 mm), 500 ml self-inflating bag (bag valve mask) for ventilation, 2 ml syringe for cuff inflation, and stethoscope.\nIntubate by following the steps below:\n\t\nPlace piglet in the supine position supporting the neck from each side to secure a straight laryngeal passage for intubation.\nEstimate the length of the endotracheal tube by measuring from the tip of the snout to the sternal notch (typically around 13 cm).\nPlace rope sling around the upper jaw (facing down) and hold lower jaw and tongue upward to keep the mouth open.",
    "Administer rocuronium bromide (1 mg/kg) i.v. to induce muscle relaxation.\nUse laryngoscope to lift the tongue upwards.\nUse the cotton tipped swab to free the piglet’s long epiglottis, which may be either retroverted into the esophagus or caught behind the soft palate.\nAdvance laryngoscope to keep the epiglottis lifted against the tongue base enabling full view of the arytenoid cartilages and vocal cords.\nApply xylocaine spray (100 mg/ml) topically in the larynx to prevent laryngeal spasms.\nAdvance endotracheal tube through the vocal cords. Use a rotating movement to aid the passing of the narrow tracheal cartilages. Advance tube according to the premeasured distance and connect to a self-inflating bag (bag valve mask) for manual ventilation. To help reduce friction during intubation spray the distal 1/3 of the endotracheal tube with xylocaine spray.\nTo confirm correct endotracheal tube placement: observe for any indication of difficulty breathing, ausculate the chest listening for bilateral air entry into both lungs, visually confirm the presence of condensation in the proximal aspect of the endotracheal tube, and verify the presence of end tidal carbon dioxide with a colorimetric carbon dioxide detector or by expiratory CO2 reading on the mechanical ventilator if available. Normal end tidal carbon dioxide is around 5%. A value above 2% together with a normal-appearing waveform will confirm that the endotracheal tube is in the trachea.\nInflate the endotracheal tube cuff to prevent aspiration. Cuff inflation pressure should be less than 25 cm H2O to avoid ischemic damage to the surrounding tissue. Holding the endotracheal tube in place, wind a piece of tape around the tube, close the jaw and continue taping around the snout to secure the tube in place. Gently pull on the tube to ensure that it stays in place.\nConnect endotracheal tube to mechanical ventilator.",
    "Adjust ventilator settings: volume-controlled ventilation, tidal volume (TV): 10 ml/kg [or peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) 15 cm with pressure controlled ventilation]. Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP): 5 cm. I:E ratio 1:2. Respiratory rate: 35 (adjust rate to maintain end-tidal CO2 between 4.5-5.5 kPa).\n4. Monitoring and Body Fluid Sampling\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52454/52454fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Equipment for monitoring. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52454/52454fig2large.jpg]\nPrepare the equipment needed for monitoring (Figure 2): adhesive tape, sterile lubricant, probe for continuous rectal temperature measurement, electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes, pulse oximeter, razor, and EEG electrodes.\n\t\nPlace saturation probe on a hind leg, lubricate rectal temperature probe and insert 6 cm into the rectum, place overhead radiant heater and/or heated inflatable air mattress to maintain the rectal temperature at the physiologic level of 38.5-39 °C, and place ECG electrodes.\nPlace piglet in the prone position to shave areas of 1 cm x 1 cm for placement of subcutaneous needle EEG electrodes; one in front of each ear, and the reference electrode in the midline just behind the eyes. Clean the electrode site with an alcohol swab, then insert the needle electrode subcutaneously. Secure electrodes with adhesive tape and return piglet to the supine position.\nTurn on aEEG monitor.\n\t\tNOTE: The amplitude integrated EEG consists of a dense trace with upper and lower margins. Lower and upper margins in this model are typically 15-50 μV, often higher than seen in infants. During hypoxia it is important to note, that artifact from the ECG may falsely elevate the aEEG trace. Bolus medications (propofol or fentanyl) may also transiently suppress the aEEG trace and should be avoided if possible during the experiment. Administration of drugs and clinical events should be marked to facilitate interpretation of the aEEG trace.",
    "Prepare the equipment needed for placing umbilical catheters for central arterial blood pressure monitoring and blood sampling (Figure 3): sterile gloves, sterile draping, scalpel, alcohol swabs, sterile wipes, umbilical vein catheter (5 Fr), umbilical artery catheter (3.5 Fr), suture set with forceps, curved micro forceps, scissors, needle holder and suture (e.g., size 3-0), transparent adhesive patch, 5 ml syringes for blood sampling.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52454/52454fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Equipment for umbilical lines and blood sampling. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52454/52454fig3large.jpg]\nSterilize and drape the area around the umbilicus. Use a scalpel to cut the umbilical cord as close to the skin as possible. If this does not expose the umbilical vessels in the anaesthetized piglet, cut the umbilical skin 2 mm below the umbilical cord to expose the vessels. Identify the two small umbilical arteries and the one larger umbilical vein (Figure 4).\nUse curved micro forceps to dilate the artery (Figure 4) and insert the umbilical arterial catheter (3.5 Fr). Estimate insertion length in cm to 3 x weight (kg) + 10 (empirical formula based on correct placement in descending aorta above renal arteries on autopsy).\nPlace a second 5 Fr catheter 5 cm into the umbilical vein (Figure 4). Verify intravascular catheter placement by blood return. Secure catheters by placing a purse-string suture around the umbilicus, pass the suture ends around each of the umbilical catheters and tie a knot. Cover catheters with transparent adhesive dressing.\nCollect blood samples at pre-specified time points: 1) immediately before hypoxia, 2) 30 min into hypoxic insult 3) at the end of the 45 min hypoxic insult 4) 2 hr after hypoxic insult. Depending on the purpose of the experiment other time points for blood samples may be chosen.",
    "Use arterial blood gas analysis from blood samples taken during hypoxia to verify blood gas changes caused by hypoxia-ischemia (Table 1). Note that piglets have low hemoglobin at birth (around 8 g/dL) and may become anemic from frequent blood sampling. Withdraw less than 2 ml blood/kg bodyweight per draw, less than 5 ml blood/kg bodyweight within 24 h and adhere to local guidelines for blood sampling. Signs of anemia include decreasing hematocrit and tachycardia.\nConnect arterial line to a monitor for continues intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring (MABP). Use venous line for fluid and drug administration.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52454/52454fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Umbilical vessels. Umbilical vein (right) and one of two umbilical arteries (left). Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52454/52454fig4large.jpg]\n5. Hypoxia\nWait 60 min after completing monitoring. Induce hypoxia by switching to a 4% O2/96% N2 gas mixture. Monitor vital parameters and aEEG closely and continue hypoxia for 45 min.\nOnce the aEEG trace is flat (upper margin <7 µV), adjust oxygenation by altering the inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) and mean airway pressure to the highest FiO2 level maintaining a flat trace aEEG according to the flowchart shown in Figure 5. Aim for MABP below 70% of baseline for at least 10 min and if needed lower FiO2 to ensure hypotension and ischemia. The described level of hypotension has previously been shown by others19,13,30 to produce relevant hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.\nIn case of severe hypotension (MABP <25 mm Hg) treat stepwise as follows: briefly increase FiO2 by 1-5%, saline bolus (10 ml/kg), infusion of dopamine (5-20 µg/kg/min), and infusion of noradrenaline (20 ng-1 µg/kg/min).",
    "In case of seizures lasting >10 min (clonic, tonic or myoclonic seizures, typically focal or as indicated by sudden changes in aEEG amplitude) treat stepwise with (allowing 30 min before proceeding to the next injection): slow bolus of phenobarbital i.v. 20 mg/kg, repeat phenobarbital i.v. 20 mg/kg, and midazolam i.v. 0.5 mg/kg.\n\t\nIf seizures develop and are nonresponsive to drug therapy euthanasia is indicated.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52454/52454fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Hypoxia-ischemia flowchart. Flowchart showing adjustments in oxygenation (FiO2 and Paw) according to aEEG response. Mean airway pressure (Paw) was adjusted by changing PIP/TV (lower PIP gives lower Paw) and respiratory rate (lower RR gives lower Paw). Target aEEG = upper margin of trace < 5 µV and lower margin of trace > 3 µV (average 4 µV). Target heart rate (HR) = > 80. Target mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) = MABP > 25.

Extubate at the point at which the animal is breathing voluntarily.\nDuring survival period, keep piglets at an animal facility with 24 hr watch by personnel trained in intensive care and monitoring. Administer i.v. glucose infusions 20 ml/kg 2-3 hourly. At 26-48 hr after hypoxia-ischemia partial bottle feeding may be initiated. Aspiration to the trachea and lungs may occur by bottle feeding if the gag reflex is not present.\nIf relevant to the experiment, evaluate neurologic status using scoring system developed by Thoresen et al., described in detail in the original publication17.\n7. Outcome Evaluation\nAfter 72 hr, anesthetize and ventilate again as described in section 2 and 3. Perform MRI scan with relevant imaging modalities as described by Munkeby et al31 and others2.",
    "At the end of the experiment euthanize piglets with a lethal dose of pentobarbital (5 g/kg i.v.).\nPrepare the brain for examination according to the goal of the experiment.\n\t\nFor brain histology on formalin fixed tissue: use cardiac perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, followed by dissection and post-fixing in paraformaldehyde as described by Robertson et al.2 , Chakkarapani et al1 or Liu et al.18 or remove the brain and immerse in 4% paraformaldehyde as described by Andresen et al.32\nFor analysis requiring snap-frozen tissue (e.g., RNA analysis or enzyme activity assays33): Remove the brain, dissect out brain regions of interest and snap-freeze tissue blocks of maximum 1 cm x 1 cm in liquid nitrogen as described by Munkeby et al.33\nSubscription Required.
