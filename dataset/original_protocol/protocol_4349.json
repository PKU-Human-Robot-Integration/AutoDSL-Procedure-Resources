    "Starch granules isolationStarch granules were purified following a modification of the Percoll method described by Tenorio et al. (2003).Homogenize 600 mg (fresh weight) of Arabidopsis leaves in a mortar and pestle in the presence of liquid N2 to a fine powder and add 1 ml of extraction buffer. Leaf material was collected from fully developed rosette leaves from at least three different plants at growth stage 3.50 [according to Boyes et al. (2001)].Filter the homogenate through two layers of Miracloth on 15 ml Falcon-type tubes.Add 5 ml of Percoll buffer (4 °C) to the filtrate and mix.Centrifuge samples for 5 min, 805 x g at 4 °C (2,000 rpm, Eppendorf-5810 R centrifuge) and discard the supernatant.Wash the pellet by resuspension in 5 ml washing buffer (4 °C), centrifuge as in step A4 and discard the supernatant. Repeat three times.Air-dry the pellet (do not let it dry completely) containing the starch granules (Figure 1) and use it immediately for determination of GBSS activity as described below.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20141204/20141204013030_8748.jpgFigure 1. Immunodetection of GBSS in starch granules isolated from Arabidopsis Col-0 leaves. Western blot employing GBSS‐specific antibodies in protein extracts from starch granules isolated from wild‐type (Col-0), GBSS mutant (gbs-1) and a recombinant line in which GBSS is fused to GFP. Molecular Mass (MM) markers are shown in kDa (left). Notice GBSS MM around 55 kDa and GBSS-GFP around 80 kDa. GBSS detection is strictly associated to starch granules fractions (three rightmost lanes) and cannot be detected in a soluble protein fraction (leftmost lane).GBSS activity assayThe granule-bound starch synthase activity was immediately measured from freshly purified starch granules. Starch granules were resuspended in 200 μl of 100 mM Tricine (pH 8.4), 25 mM potassium acetate, 10 mM DTT, 5 mM EDTA and 10 mM ADP [U-14C] glucose (specific activity 7.4 GBq/mol).",
    "100 µl aliquot was quickly extracted and boiled for 5 min to represent DPMtotal of the assay.The rest of the reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 20-60 min. The reaction was stopped by boiling for 5 min.Starch granules were precipitated by adding 1.875 ml of precipitation buffer and 25 µl of glycogen solution as an inert carrier to increase recovery from alcohol precipitation.Tubes were centrifuged 3 min, 2,000 x g at 4 °C (4,615 rpm, Eppendorf-5424) and the supernatant discarded.The pellet was resuspended in 0.2 ml deionized water and washed by an additional precipitation with 1.750 ml precipitation buffer without glycogen.Tubes were centrifuged as in step B5. The pellet was air-dried for a short time, resuspended in 1 ml of deionized water and transferred into an appropriate scintillation vial.5 ml of EcoLite liquid scintillation cocktail was added to enhance 14C counting efficiency.Finally, the radioactivity incorporated into the starch granules was determined with a scintillation counter.GBSS activity (see Table 1 and Figure 2) is calculated by using the following formula:Activity (nmol/min/gfw)= imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180107/20180107193126_0764.jpgDPMreac = disintegration per minute of the reaction sample minus DPM blank (Table 1)nmol = nmoles of ADP [U-14C]glucose (1,000 nmol according to the protocol)DPMtotal = total DPM of added ADP[U-14C]glucose (step B2)t = reaction time (min) (20-60 min according to the protocol)gfw = fresh weight (g) (0.3 g according to the protocol)Table 1.

Blank sample is identical to each sample except that it was stopped at time 0, so that the reaction was not allowed to start.To simplify, a single sample measurement is shown in Table 1. We recommend calculating data from three independent experiments. Sample DPM correspond to the Disintegration Per Minute at the desired reaction time for each sample (experimental data). DPMtotal is the total amount of DPM provided by the radiolabelled substrate. It actually represents the maximum of DPM for each sample. According to the above example it consists on the total DPM given by 1,000 nmol of ADP[U-14C]glucose determined for aliquots from step B2.DPMreac = DPMsample minus DPMblankimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20141204/20141204013059_8753.jpgFigure 2.

GBSS activity (nmol/min/gfw) in starch granules from wild‐type (Col-0), GBSS mutant (gbs-1), GBSS fused to GFP under its own promoter (pGBSS:GBSS:GFP) in gbs-1 background and GBSS expressed under the 35S promoter (P35S:GBSS) in gbs-1 background lines. Values are the average of three independent experiments. Bars indicate the standard deviation (±SEM). Starch granules isolation and GBSS activity was carried out as described in text."
