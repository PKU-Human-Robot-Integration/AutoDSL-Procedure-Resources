    "This PBD protocol was implemented in a parent clinical trial protocol (NCT03029884), approved by UCSF Human Research Protection Program and FDA. Each participant (3 female and 2 male, age range: 51-67 years) signed written informed consent; they were recruited from the UCSF pain management center or referred by physicians in the United States.\n1. Pain body diagram setup\nPatient inclusion criteria: Include participants with the following pain diagnoses: several neuropathic pain etiologies, including central post-stroke pain (2 patients) and neurodegenerative spine disease with radicular pain (1 patient), complex regional pain syndrome (1 patient), and spinal cord injury (1 patient). All participants have completed post-high school education.\nImport a gender-appropriate PBD template (Supplementary Figure 1), displaying both front and back body surfaces, into an illustration application that contains a pressure-sensitive drawing tool on a touch-sensitive digital tablet. Download the PBD template to the tablet's photo library, then click the Import button.\nCreate a new layer on top of the PBD template by clicking the Layers icon followed by the + button for the participant to draw on. This results in two layers, one with the PBD and one to be drawn in with colors indicating pain.\nCreate a new brush with a x=y pressure-to-hue transformation curve by first clicking the Brush Library icon, then + to open the brush studio.\nClick on the button labeled Color Dynamics, then scroll down to the color pressure section. For the hue slider, click the Numeric Percentage to ensure the pressure transformation graph visualizes a straight 45° line.\n\tNOTE: Double-clicking the graph will provide the option to reset the graph to the straight x=y graph.",
    "To define the hue gradient range from green to blue to red, adjust the hue slider under the color pressure section by clicking the Percentage Number Listed and inputting a numeric value of 81%.\n\t​NOTE: Another way of doing this is to enter hexadecimal limits of #008000 to #FF0000 if the application allows for manual entry of hexacodes.\nSelect a pen size that accommodates the needs of study participants by adjusting the pen tool slider. A pen size of 30% is a good starting size for most participants.\n2. Instructions for the participants\nDescribe the PBD anatomy and orientation of the body templates in portrait mode, the drawing and erasing tools, the tactile pinch-to-zoom and the panning functionality to the patient.\nExplain the pressure-to-hue linear transformation to participants in the following manner: inform participants that increased pressure applied to the stylus will result in hues that shift from green to blue to red which should be colored into the diagram to represent mild to moderate to severe pain intensity at any given location, respectively.\nUsing the teach-back method24, confirm the participant's understanding of the PBD task by asking them to explain how to fill in the diagram using their own words.\nAllow participants at least 15 min of practice time to draw multiple PBDs on a flat surface to ensure accurate representation of pain location and intensity. Allow for any adjustments to be made to maximize usability. Review the PBDs immediately afterwards with each participant to ensure consistency and that colors are drawn as intended.\n3. Data collection and pre-processing",
    "Ask participants to complete PBDs during baseline or at various time points after some treatment or intervention. Allow for an open-ended amount of time for the completion of each PBD so that each map can be completed to the participant's satisfaction.\nSave completed PBDs with a standardized filename containing patient ID as well as date and time when PBD was completed.\n\tNOTE: These files are saved temporarily on the tablet device.\nBulk export completed PBDs in either portable document format (.PDF) or photoshop document (.PSD) file format that retains image layers for pre-processing. To bulk export, first click the Select icon to choose the desired images, then click Share to open a menu of image formats for export. Click the format file of choice.\n\tNOTE: Exported files are uploaded to a secure research server.\nDownload PBDs and open in a raster-based image editor.\nIsolate the colored pixels of interest from the top layer of the PBD file by adding two mask layers: one completely black layer below the colored-in layer and one black mask layer to exclude pixels outside the template body outline above the colored-in layer. This will result in processed PBDs that only contain the colored pixels within the body outline on a black background (Figure 1).\nExport the processed PBDs as portable network graphics (.png) files by clicking and selecting the following sequence of buttons: File > Export > Export As > PNG > Export.\n4. PBD Quantification\nConvert each pixel value in the PBD from RGB (red, green, blue) color space into HSV (hue, saturation, value) color space using OpenCV225, a publicly available Python package. Extract the hue value for each pixel by running the python scripts titled rgba2hsv(filename) (Supplementary Coding File 1) and measure_SAnoblur(filename, sigma-1.0) (Figure 1).",
    "NOTE: These scripts quantify and adjust hue values to create a continuous hue scale from 0-139.5. The HSV values on OpenCV2 range from 0-179. The lightest green, which represents the least pain intensity, corresponds to the hue value of 39.5. Some red hues correspond to values between 0-10. Yellow and orange colors which correspond to hue values between 10-39.5 are not used by the pen tool. The red hue values from 0-10 are reassigned to 179 to correctly represent the most pain intensity. The hue scale ranges from 39.5-179 after this adjustment. Then, 39.5 is subtracted from each hue value so that the final scale ranges from 0-139.5.\nCalculate and normalize the three PBD metrics by running the Python script titled quantifypain(filename) (Supplementary Coding File 1).\n\t\nThe script calculates each metric as described below.\n\t\t\nPBD coverage: Divide the number of colored pixels by the total number of pixels available within the body diagram. The range for the number of colored pixels for females is 0 to 820,452 pixels (total pixels) and the range for males is 0 to 724,608 pixels (total pixels).\nPBD sum intensity: Add the hue values for all pixels in the body diagram. The range for the sum of hue values for females is 0 to 114,453,054 and the range for males is 0 to 101,082,816.\nPBD mean intensity: Divide the sum of all hue values by the total number of colored pixels.\nUse the script to normalize all PBD measures on a 0 to 100 scale by following calculations described below.\n\t\t\nPBD coverage: Multiply PBD coverage by 100.",
    "PBD sum: Divide PBD sum intensity by the maximum PBD sum intensity and multiply by 100. The maximum PBD sum intensity equals the total number of pixels in the body diagram multiplied by 139.5 (i.e., for females, it is 820,452 pixels multiplied by 139.5 which equals 114,453,054; for males, it is 724,608 pixels multiplied by 139.5 which equals 101,082,816).\nPBD mean: Divide PBD mean intensity by the maximum hue value of 139.5 and multiply by 100.\nRepeat steps 4.1 and 4.2 to process each PBD (with extension .png) file. Compile the outputs in a spreadsheet to run further analyses."
