    "All procedures involving animal tissue follow the guidelines of the local Animal Care and Ethics Committee.\n1. Preparation of organ culture and laser treatment\nObtain freshly enucleated porcine eyes from the local abattoir. Keep them cool (4 °C) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with high glucose, supplemented with L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, penicillin/streptomycin (1%), and porcine serum (10%), henceforth referred to in this article as full medium.\nRemove extracellular tissues with scissors and soak the eyes in 5% povidone-iodine ophthalmic solution for 5 min before placing them in sterilized phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) until use.\nScreen eyes for major anterior segment pathologies, such as corneal scarring, edema, and other opacities with a spectral-domain optical coherence tomography device (Table of Materials).\nPosition the eyes in front of a slit-lamp unit equipped with a Nd:YAG laser (Table of Materials), which has a wavelength of 1,064 nm and a focal spot diameter of 10 µm in air.\n\tNOTE: For optimal positioning a 3D-printed holding apparatus is used, which was designed to hold the eye firm, without putting too much pressure on it (Figure 1).\nUse a magnification of 12x and deflect the illumination to visualize the individual corneal layers.\nSet the pulse energy (e.g., 1.6 mJ) and focus point (e.g., 0.16 mm) for selective ablation of endothelial cells.\nPlace a clear cornea paracentesis close to the limbus and inject viscoelastic (Table of Materials) to stabilize the anterior chamber.\nExcise the laser-treated central cornea using an 8 mm trephine.\nPlace the excised cornea in a well of a 12-well plate with the endothelial site facing upwards and incubate the specimen in 3 mL of full medium at 37 °C for up to 3 days.\n\tNOTE: Potential cytoprotective agents can be added to the medium during this step.\n2. Preparation for histology",
    "Prepare Sorensen’s buffer with a pH of 7.4 containing 19.6 mL of 133 mM KH2PO4 and 80.4 mL of 133 mM Na2HPO4.\nRemove the medium from the cornea-containing well and fixate the tissue for 20 min at room temperature (RT) using methanol-free paraformaldehyde (4%) in Sorensen’s buffer.\nPlace tissue in 20% sucrose in PBS until tissue sinks (1 h) and then in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight at RT. Take care to avoid contact with bubbles and the air surface interface. Embed tissue in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound and store at -80 °C.\nCut sections 10 μm thick using a cryostat at -27 °C.\n\tNOTE: A camel hairbrush is useful to help guide the emerging section over the knife blade.\nTransfer the section to a microscope slide by touching the slide to the tissue within 1 min of cutting it to avoid freeze-drying of the tissue. Store the slides at -80 °C.\n3. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining\nAir dry sections for several minutes to remove moisture.\nStain with filtered 0.1% Mayers hematoxylin for 10 min in a 50 mL tube.\nIn a Coplin jar, rinse in cool running ddH2O for 5 min and dip in 0.5% eosin 10x.\nDip in ddH2O until the eosin stops streaking and then dip in 50% (10x) as well as 70% (10x) EtOH.\nEquilibrate in 95% EtOH (30 s) and 100% EtOH (60 s) before dipping in xylene several times.\nFinally mount and coverslip the specimen before taking images using a light microscope.\nSubscription Required.
