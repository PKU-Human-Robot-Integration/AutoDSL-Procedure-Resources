    "CAUTION: All applicable safety precautions should be followed when performing this procedure, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) (e.g., lab coats, nitrile gloves, safety glasses, etc.)\n1. Preparation of Reagents and Equipment\nPreparation of solutions\nTo prepare 500 mL of Carnoy's fluid, mix 100% ethanol (EtOH), chloroform, and glacial acetic acid in a 6:3:1 v/v/v ratio in a clean glass Schott bottle.\nTo make liquid nitrocellulose (NC), dissolve NC membrane (commonly used in western blotting) in neat acetone, by gentle agitation, to a final concentration of 40 mg/mL.\nPreparation of NC coated slides\nUse a technique similar to the one used for the preparation of blood smears for histological examination20 to prepare NC coated slides.\nPipette 40 µL of liquid NC onto one edge of a conductive indium tin oxide (ITO) microscope slide. Using a regular glass microscope slide, drag the NC under surface tension across the slide to create an even thin film coating.\nAllow the NC to dry at room temperature for 20 s and then store until needed at room temperature. Storage of samples under these conditions can be indefinite provided the tissues are maintained and free of dust.\n\t\tNOTE: This method of preparation is better known as \"thin film\" and will produce a uniform coating that relies on the viscosity of the NC as well as its lack of surface tension to self-level on the slide. The only care that should be taken when preparing the slides is not moving too quickly, which will create streaks of NC rather than a complete coverage.",
    "​CAUTION: As liquid NC dries very quickly, it is essential to work quickly to avoid drying the solution before it has been properly spread. Care should also be taken when handling NC in its liquid state, as it is a highly energetic compound and should not contact a source of ignition to prevent incendiary explosion. NC also undergoes endothermic transitions when drying and can cause cold burns if allowed to come into prolonged contact with skin or gloved hands. To minimize all associated risks, only small amounts should be prepared at each time (<1 mL is recommended). Once dry it is stable at room temperature. However, NC can remain explosive when present in large quantities.\nCreation of custom vapor chambers\nCut a piece of thick blotting paper with a pair of scissors big enough to fit the bottom half of a standard plastic petri dish (94 mm in diameter and 3 mm thick).\nCut the paper, leaving a rectangular strip in the center, the same size as a microscope slide, leaving enough excess so that the paper will maintain its position in the Petri dish (Supplementary Figure 1).\n2. Preparation of Tissue Sections\nFFPE Tissue21.\nSelect the desired tissue block and section it at 12 µm thickness in a standard bench mounted microtome and float mount onto the NC pre-coated ITO slides.\nSubmerge the slides in fresh xylene to remove residual paraffin for 2 min, and repeat the operation a second time.\n\t\tNOTE: If the paraffin block is especially pervasive or the tissue is relatively small compared to the paraffin block, the samples can be heated at 60 °C to melt the majority away prior to washing in xylene.",
    "Wash the deparaffinized samples by submerging the slides in a graded solvent series: 70% v/v EtOH/water, 100% EtOH, Carnoy's fluid, 100% EtOH, ultra-pure water and 100% EtOH. The duration of each submersion should be 30 s, except for Carnoy's fluid, which must last 2 min.\n\t\t​CAUTION: Carnoy's fluid and xylene must be stored and used in a fume hood, as they are highly toxic if inhaled.\nFormalin-Fixed Frozen (FFF) Tissue\n\tNOTE: Samples should already be frozen, appropriately according to the sample type.\n\t\nEquilibrate the tissue block at the operating temperature of the microtome for 20 min22.\n\t\tNOTE: Equilibration temperature is dependent on the type of tissue.\nSection the tissue using a microtome at 12 µm and thaw mount the sections onto a pre-prepared NC coated ITO slide.\nStore the slides in a vacuum desiccator on the bench in the dark.\n\t\tNOTE: Samples can be stored for several weeks under these conditions.\nWash the samples in a graded solvent series as stated for FFPE tissue (2.1.3).\n\t\tNOTE: There is no need for a xylene deparaffinisation step as the sample is not embedded.\n3. Methylene Crosslink Hydrolysis\nLoad the sample slides (either FFF or FFPE) into a plastic slide box which is filled to the top with 20 mmol tris-HCl (pH 8.8). Seal the box and place it in a water bath, containing 500 mL of water, allowing the box to touch the bottom. Then heat it for 15 min at 120 °C in a pressure cooker which can achieve an operating pressure of 70 kPa.\nRemove the slides, allow them to cool, and let them dry at ambient temperature for 15 min.\n4. Tissue Digestion",
    "Once hydrolyzed, coat the samples with 10 µL of trypsin solution (1 mg/mL) in ultra-pure water, by pipetting 10 µL of the solution onto the edge of the tissue section then, using the same pipette tip, drag the droplet across the whole surface of the tissue under surface tension.\n\tNOTE: Avoid scratching the tissue surface with the pipette tip and over spreading the enzyme beyond the borders of the tissue edges.\nAllow the samples to dry at ambient temperature.\nOnce dry, mount the samples inside the top of the previously constructed vapor chamber (tissue facing down) with autoclave tape on either edge of the slide (Supplementary Figure 2).\nPipette 600 µL of a solution containing a 1:1 v/v mix of 100% acetonitrile and 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate carefully onto the blotting paper finger in the bottom part of the petri dish until the finger appears to be evenly wet.\nPlace the top half of the vapor chamber on the bottom half, ensuring the paper finger and sample slide align perfectly, and seal the chamber around its equator with paraffin film.\nLeave the sample overnight in a 37 °C incubator to allow complete digestion.\n5. Matrix Coating via Sublimation\nOnce digested, weigh the sample slide on a 5-digit microanalytical balance.\nMount the slide onto the cooling finger of the sublimation apparatus and secure it with copper tape, in the same way as described for the vapor chamber (Supplementary Figure 3).\n\tNOTE: To ensure that the slide is contacted evenly by the cooling finger, a layer of copper tape is placed on the bottom of the cooling finger to level the surface. This ensures that the slide is evenly cooled which leads to even deposition of matrix.",
    "Place 300 mg of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) matrix into a glass petri dish at the bottom of the chamber and spread evenly to create a thin layer of matrix crystals.\nAssemble the sublimator and secure the two halves with the horseshoe clamp. Suspend the assembled unit 15-20 cm above a sand bath, preheated at 220 °C, by placing it in a metal ring connected to a retort stand.\nConnect the chamber to the vacuum source, engage the vacuum, and allow it to stabilize down to ~25 mTorr for 5 min.\nPack the cooling finger to the top with ice and add 50 mL of water. Allow the apparatus to settle for a further 5 min before proceeding.\nLower the chamber onto the surface of the sand, ensuring the sand completely contacts the bottom of the chamber, and leave it for 45 min to create an ideal coating of 0.22 mg/cm2\n\tCAUTION: Care should be taken when handling glassware at high vacuum, as any damage to the apparatus, while evacuated, can result in catastrophic failure of the glass chamber.\nAfter 45 min, remove the chamber from the sand bath by raising the metal ring and vent the chamber.\n\tNOTE: Once the chamber has been vented, the slide must be removed very quickly as water in the air will begin to condense on the freezing finger and sample slide.\nRemove the slide and weigh it to ensure the desired coating has been achieved.\n\tNOTE: If insufficient coating has been achieved, simply repeat the sublimation process for the slide until the desired coating thickness has been achieved.\n6. Recrystallization\nOnce sublimated, mount the sample slide inside the top of the previously constructed vapor chamber, as described earlier (tissue facing down).",
    "Pipette 600 µL of a solution containing a 1:1 (v/v) mix of 100% acetonitrile and 0.1% v/v trifluoroacetic acid in water carefully onto the blotting paper in the bottom part of the petri dish to ensure an even coating.\nAssemble the chamber, ensuring the paper tab and microscope slide align perfectly, and leave in a 37 °C incubator for 1 h.\n\tCaution: DO NOT seal the chamber.\n\tNOTE: Once recrystallized, the normally yellow hue of the matrix should change to white, look less shiny, and appear very even. This indicates that recrystallization has been performed correctly.\nThe sample is now ready for analysis.\n7. Instrumentation\nScan the slide in a flatbed scanner to create a digital image.\nLoad the sample into the mass spectrometer and then analyze using the appropriate software platform.\nAnalyze the samples in positive ion reflectron mode with a mass range of 750-3,500 Da, with a spot resolution that is applicable to the desired result. In most cases, 20-50 µm raster width is sufficient, however as little as 10 µm can be used15.\n\tCAUTION: MALDI UV lasers are a source of ionizing radiation and should not be viewed directly. Ensure that the laser is contained within instrument shielding prior to operation.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
