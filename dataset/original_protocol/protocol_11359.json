    "Written informed consent of the patients was obtained after the approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee.\n1. DPSC Isolation and Culture\nTransfer wisdom teeth obtained from young adults aged between 17 and 20 to 15 mL tubes containing complete Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) [low glucose DMEM media, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin (PSA) solution], within 8 h after resection. Keep the tissue material cold (4 °C) during transfer to avoid potential cell death.\nRemove the pulp tissue by sterile extraction forceps from the center of the tooth carefully, place the pulp tissue in the cold complete DMEM medium in 10 cm tissue culture dishes, and mince them into small pieces (2-3 mm) by scalpel.\n\tNOTE: All experimental procedures should be carried out under sterile conditions in laminar flow hood. This non-enzymatic technique has been previously used21,22,23.\nPlace small pulp tissues inside the tissue culture treated 6-well plates and add 200 µL of complete DMEM media to cover each small pulp tissue pieces.\nIncubate the tissue culture wells at 37 °C in a humidified air atmosphere (80% humidity) with 5% CO2 for 2 h to provide tissue attachment.\n\tNOTE: This step could be prolonged to 3-4 h by controlling the evaporation of media.\nAdd appropriate volume (2-2.5 mL) of complete DMEM medium to the wells and incubate at 37 °C in a humidified air atmosphere with 5% CO2 for cells to spread from the tissue.\n\tNOTE: Cells become visible after approximately 4 days and reach confluency after 8-9 days.",
    "When cells reach 80% confluency, remove media from 6-well plates, wash with 2 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and add 2 mL of trypsin. Incubate for 2 min in an incubator at 37 °C with humidified air atmosphere and 5% CO2. Then add 2 mL of complete DMEM medium followed by 2 min incubation to inhibit trypsin. Centrifuge cells at 300 x g for 5 min to pellet cells.\nPassage cells to the flasks in complete DMEM media and store for further experiments. Add 15 mL of complete DMEM media to the T-75 flasks and transfer cells from two wells of the 6-well plate to one T-75 flasks and incubate at 37 °C with humidified air atmosphere and 5% CO2.\n2. Characterization of DPSCs\nPerform morphological analyses.\n\t\nSeed cells (step 1.6) in tissue culture coated flasks (or 6-well plates) in complete DMEM medium for at least 8 passages to observe cell morphology.\nVisualize cells by light microscope and define fibroblast-like cell morphology. Cells should attach to the culture dishes and have spindle-like cell morphology.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, cells can be cultured as single cells for up to 14 days in well-plates to observe colony formation capacity that is a specific characteristic of fibroblasts and MSCs.\nPerform surface marker analyses.\n\t\nTrypsinize the cells from step 1.7. Remove media from the T-75 tissue culture flask, wash with 2 mL of PBS, and add 2 mL of trypsin. Incubate for 2 min in an incubator at 37 °C with humidified air atmosphere and 5% CO2. Then add 2 mL of complete DMEM medium followed by 2 min incubation to inhibit trypsin. Centrifuge cells at 300 x g for 5 min to pellet cells.",
    "Fix the cells with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature in 1.5 mL tubes and then wash them with 500 µL of PBS 3 times to remove paraformaldehyde.\nIncubate fixed cells with the antibodies against CD29, CD34, CD14, CD45, CD90, CD105, CD166, and CD73 for 1 h at 4 °C in 100 µL of PBS.\n\t\tNOTE: The concentration of antibody used is 0.5 µg/mL. CD34, CD14, and CD45 are used as negative markers, while CD29, CD90, CD105, CD166, and CD73 are used as positive cell surface markers for MSCs.\nWash cells 3 times with PBS and use respective secondary antibodies such as fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), phycoerythrin (PE), etc. for labelling. Incubate cells with 1:500 diluted secondary antibodies in 100 µL of PBS for 30 min at 4 °C and wash 3 times with PBS.\nKeep samples in the dark for flow cytometry analysis and detect positive and negative staining by flow cytometry.\n\t\tNOTE: Use unstained control cells to arrange forward and side scatter. Arrange gating of positively stained populations by excluding dead cells, debris, and un-stained population. Use 100 µm nozzle with 45 psi sheath pressure and collect 10,000 events to determine positive DPSCs by arranging channels.\nPerform differentiation of DPSCs.\n\t\nSeed 1 × 104 cells onto 24-well plates in complete DMEM media and incubate for 24 h at 37 °C in a humidified air atmosphere with 5% CO2.",

Wash the fixed cells with PBS and stain them with the vonKossa kit according to the manufacturer’s recommendations to observe calcium deposits.\nPrepare the Alcian blue staining solution by dissolving 1.00 g of Alcian blue dye in 100 mL of 3% (v/v) acetic acid for further staining. Wash the fixed cells with PBS and stain cells for 30 min with Alcian blue solution. Visualize the stained samples by a light microscope.\n3. Preparation of Condition Medium (CM)\nReplace media of cells from step 1.7 with fresh complete DMEM 24 h before CM collection.\n\tNOTE: Passage 2-4 is recommended.\nCollect condition medium (CM) from cultured DPSCs when cells reach 80% confluency.

    "NOTE: Open the scratch image with Image J software. Draw a line that has the same magnitude as the scale bar that already exists in the image. Click analyze, set scale, and observe distance in pixels as the magnification of the drawn line. Write the size of the scale bar to the known distance part, arrange unit (pixels, cm, etc.), and click ok. Go to the analyze section again and click on measurements. This will first give the size of the scale bar as the selected unit. Click on one edge of scratch and drag until reaching the other end of the scratch. Note the value for each time point (0 h and 24 h). Plug these values into the formula above and calculate the scratch closure.\n5.
