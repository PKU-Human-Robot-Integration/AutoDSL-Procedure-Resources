    "LPS sample preparationCulture H. pylori strains on CBA plates, incubate at 37 °C for 24 h under microaerobic conditions.Use a loop (10 μl) to harvest H. pylori cells grown on CBA plates (24 h growth) into 1 ml of cold 1x PBS (see Recipes) to a turbidity of 3.0 at OD600.Centrifuge the H. pylori cells at 5,000 x g for 5 min, discard supernatant.Resuspend the pellet in 100 µl LPS lysis buffer (see Recipes) and heat the sample at 100 °C for 10 min, and allow to cool at room temperature.Add 5 μl Proteinase K (20 mg/ml) to the cooled samples, and incubate in a 55 °C water bath overnight.Load 10 μl of the above-obtained LPS sample per well to the 15% SDS-PAGE gel and electrophorese with 1x SDS-PAGE running buffer (see Recipes).Once the gel electrophoresis is complete, remove the gel from the apparatus and trim away the stacking gel.LPS silver stainingRinse the gel 3 times with ddH2O. Transfer the gel to a separate ware with freshly-made oxidation solution (see Recipes), oxidize for 20 min on a rotary shaker (70 rpm/min) (all shaking in this protocol is done at room temperature).Transfer the gel to a separate clean ware, rinse and wash with ddH2O for 3 times, each time with 200 ml ddH2O on a rotary shaker for 10 min.Transfer the gel to a separate ware with freshly-made silver staining solution (see Recipes), stain for 10 min on a rotary shaker.Note: The silver staining solution must be freshly-made, which can be made during the final wash of step B4. During the staining process, the ware should be wrapped in aluminum foil, but make sure the foil is not in contact with the solution.",
    "Transfer the gel to a separate clean ware, rinse and wash for 3 times, each time with 200 ml ddH2O on a rotary shaker for 10 min.Transfer the gel to a separate ware with freshly-made color developer solution (see Recipes), develop for 2-10 min on a rotary shaker. Note: The color developer solution must be freshly-made, which can be made during the final wash of step B6. The color will develop on the gel within to 2-10 min, the longer the developer solution remains in contact with the gel the darker the bands will become. Therefore, it is important to watch the gel develop. The operator must decide when the gel is sufficiently developed and transfer the gel to the termination solution (see Recipes). Transfer the gels to a separate ware with freshly-made termination solution for 1 min. The gels are then rinsed and stored in ddH2O. Use a digital camera to take images of the silver-stained LPS gels.Western blot for the detection of Lewis antigen expressionProceed from step 7 of Procedure A.Transfer LPS from the gel to PVDF membrane with 1x SDS-PAGE transfer buffer (see Recipes).Once the transfer is complete, remove the membrane from the apparatus. Rinse the membrane 3 times with ddH2O. Block the membrane with TBST (see Recipes) containing 3% BSA, on a rotary shaker for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C.Pour off the blocking solution.Probe with primary antibodies: mouse anti-Lex/y or anti-Lea/b (1:1,500) (Santa Cruz) in TBST containing 1% BSA, on a rotary shaker for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C.Pour off the primary antibody solution.Rinse and wash with TBST for 3 times, each time on a rotary shaker for 10 min.Probe with secondary rabbit anti-mouse peroxidase-conjugated IgM antibody (1:10,000) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) in TBST, on a rotary shaker for 1 h.",
    "Pour off the secondary antibody solution.Rinse and wash with TBST for 3 times, each time on a rotary shaker for 10 min.Place the membrane on a flat sheet of plastic film.Add approximately 5 ml of the chemiluminescent peroxidase substrate-1 working solution (Sigma-Aldrich) on the membrane.Cover the membrane with a second flat sheet of plastic film.Detect chemiluminescence using a LAS-3000 Intelligent DarkBox (Fujifilm) (software Image reader LAS 3000 V2.2)."
