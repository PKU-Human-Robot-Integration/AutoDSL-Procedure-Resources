    "The cases described herein were performed following Ethical permission granted by the Animal Ethics and Welfare Committee of the Colegio de Veterinarios de Malaga, Spain, and the Royal Veterinary College, North Mymms, U.K. The procedures used on the horses are based on approved protocols that are used in clinic on horses receiving stem cell based therapies which includes sedation, bone-marrow aspiration, intra-tendinous injection, regional perfusion, intravenous injection, post-procedural treatment and pain management and monitoring after implantation.\n1. Key Arrangements to be Made in Advance\nSeek institutional ethics and animal welfare approval and adhere to local legal requirements prior to starting work.\nSeek institutional approval to work with ionizing radiation as dictated by local and legal regulations including the appropriate level of protection of personnel and the environment and the disposal of contaminated waste.\nUse the following inclusion criteria: horses present with a non-traumatic overstrain injury (tendinopathy or desmopathy) to the superficial flexor digital tendon of the forelimb and lesions resulting in a defect within the tendon and the defect is surrounded by intact tendon and/or paratenon.\n\tNote: The examination and diagnosis for such injuries and the clinical preparation of the horses for cell implantation has been detailed elsewhere6,15.\n\tNote: The isolation and expansion in culture of BMMSC derived from the bone marrow of horses has been detailed previously6,16. The current protocol for injecting BMMSC for SDFT injuries in the horse uses 10 million cells per ml4 of autologous bone marrow supernatant (BMS)16.\nUse cells that have undergone no more than 4 passages for in vivo implantation to avoid potential cellular phenotype or genetic alterations associated with high passage number cells.",
    "Deliver the required number of cells in the BMS (within 24 hr in a chill box at 4 – 8 oC) to the veterinary clinic where the cell implantation is to be performed.\n\tNote: The clinical use of mesenchymal stem cells in bone marrow supernatant is a patented procedure owned by ReCellerate Inc (U.S.A.) and its use may require authorization.\n\tNote: Tc-99m is a gamma emitter (140 keV) with a relatively short half-life (6.0058 hr, therefore nearly 94% of it decays to its stable form of 99Tc in 24 hr). The gamma energy makes it suitable for detection by gamma cameras (scintigraphy) and the short half-life results in very limited radiation exposure time to both the horse and the animal handling personnel. This protocol describes the on-site labeling of cells using Tc-99m-HMPAO [HMPAO labeled with Tc-99m (as sodium pertechnetate)].\nOrder the Tc-99m fresh from the supplier such that it is delivered and used for labeling the cells within 2 hr of elution from the Tc-99m generator. Ensure that the Tc-99m is supplied as 1 GBq in a 1 ml solution (supplier’s standard buffer).\nUse all buffers at RT. Perform the labeling procedure, implantation of the cells and imaging (gamma scintigraphy) in an isotope containment room with all equipment cleaned with alcohol wipes prior to the start of work.\n2. Preparation of the Horse and Ultrasonography of the Forelimb Tendon\nRecord ultrasound scans at first admission for injury (when bone marrow is aspirated) and then at the time point when radiolabeled cells are injected.\nPerform ultrasonography and cell implantation with the horse bearing weight evenly in a stall and under standing sedation (rather than general anesthesia). Administer sedation using a mixture of detomidine HCl and butorphanol tartrate, each at 0.01 to 0.02 mg/kg IV.",
    "Note: Recovery is rapid and post-surgical treatment requires no special considerations. \nAfter perineural anesthesia is applied (step 2.6) in the affected limb, keep the horse at the station under sedation to reduce movement of the horse during the treatment. Visually check the appropriate level of sedation judged from the lowered head position and the demeanour of the horse and that the horse is comfortable during cell injection and the movements of the gamma camera during the acquisition of scintigraphic images.\n\tNote: It is not necessary to apply vet ointment on eyes (to prevent dryness) because under sedation blinking is not affected and the horse is able to maintain hydration of the eyes. The monitoring after the implantation of the cells is non-invasive (ultrasound and gamma scintigraphy).\nClip closely the hair overlying the tendon (with horse hair clippers) then clean the clipped area using a combination of a chlorhexidine surgical scrub and finally alcohol.\nApply acoustic coupling gel to the area and scan methodically to record scans of the complete palmar metacarpal region, sequentially labeled levels 1 - 717, with a linear transducer (12 MHz or similar) to obtain serial on-incidence transverse and longitudinal images. Store the images digitally so that the cross-sectional area and the maximal injury zone4 can be obtained with the aid of image analysis software.\nPrepare the area overlying the palmar nerves immediately distal to the carpus for aseptic injection of local anesthetic to ensure complete desensitization of the skin overlying the tendon and the superficial digital flexor tendon. Inject 2 ml of mepivicaine both subcutaneously and adjacent to the palmar nerves (in their sub-fascial location) between the flexor tendons and the suspensory ligament immediately distal to the carpus on both sides of the limb.",
    "Once the preliminary scan has been performed prepare the implantation site by scrubbing the area with a chlorhexidine surgical scrub solution for at least 5 min and finally alcohol with soaked gauze. Perform all subsequent steps in an aseptic fashion.\n3. Tc-99m-labeling of Equine Mesenchymal Stem Cells\nNote: The cell labeling steps can be performed during ultrasonography of the forelimb as this will minimize isotope decay between cell labeling and implantation of labeled cells into the tendon.\nRemove the BMS from the cells as it interferes with the uptake of isotope. To do this, retrieve the vial of BMMSC (10 million cells in 1 ml of BMS) from the chill box and pellet the cells in a microcentrifuge at 350 x g for 5 min at RT. Carefully remove the supernatant with an 18G or 19G needle (attached to a 2 ml syringe), leaving a small drop ( ≤0.1 ml) in the tube to aid cell resuspension. Save the supernatant (the BMS) in a sterile microcentrifuge tube and keep on ice for later re-use.\nResuspend the cells in the residual droplet of supernatant by flicking the tube gently with fingers (rather than vortex) and leave the tube in a rack at RT. Ensure the cells are completely resuspended and that there are no visible cell clumps.\nPrepare the Tc-99m as follows. Transfer 1 ml of technetium pertechnetate into a vial of HMPAO using a 1 ml syringe and needle. Mix gently but thoroughly and leave for 5 min behind lead shielding. Note: This step can be done while the cells are spinning in step 2.1.\nAdd all of the Tc-99m-HMPAO mixture using a 1 ml syringe and needle to the cells and mix gently. Incubate for 30 min at RT behind lead shielding.",
    "For the next steps, use a forceps (or a piece of tissue paper) to open the lid of the microcentrifuge tube to minimize isotope contamination of the (gloved) thumb and subsequently other equipment. Use a 2 ml syringe and 21 G needle to add or remove wash buffer.\n\tNote: The use of a field isotope monitor is encouraged to monitor contamination of surfaces and equipment.\nAdd 1 ml PBS to the Tc-99m-HMPAO-cell mixture, close the lid, mix gently and spin to pellet the cells as in step 3.1.\nCarefully remove the PBS to a new tube (save this behind lead shielding and label as W1). Resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml of fresh PBS. Centrifuge the tube and remove the supernatant as above (save this and label as W2).\nCalculate the efficiency of labeling by measuring the counts in W1 and W2 tubes and in the cell pellet. Do this by placing each tubes in a Well isotope dose calibrator instrument and recording the radioactivity as counts per minute (CPM). Calculate the labeling efficiency as (Radioactivity as CPM of cells) / (Radioactivity of cells + supernatant) x 100.\nResuspend the cells thoroughly in the residual PBS and then add the BMS saved from step 3.1. The cells are ready for intralesional implantation.\n4. Implantation of Tc-99m-HMPAO-labeled Cells\nIntralesional implantation into the tendon under ultrasound guidance\n\t\nSlowly introduce a 1.5 or 2 inch (50 mm) 20 G needle into the maximum injury zone of the lesion in a longitudinal orientation with the ultrasound transducer, covered in a sterile drape, in line with the needle so that the length of the needle can be identified ultrasonographically and the tip if the needle is accurately located in the center of the lesion.",
    "Using appropriate shielding, collect the cells into a 2 ml syringe (Luer-lock, to minimize the risk of external contamination and in a lead-shielded syringe cover) using an 20 G needle. Discard the needle being careful not to lose any fluid. Now attach the syringe with the labeled cells onto the needle pre-located in the tendon.\nPlace the ultrasound probe under the needle so that the needle tract in the tissue is clearly visible. Inject the cells at a slow but steady pace into the lesion. Ensure that there is no resistance to injection. If this is encountered carefully reposition the needle under ultrasound guidance. Check that the fluid ejecting into the lesion is visible on the ultrasound image as anechoic fluid containing hyperechogenic air bubbles.\nWithdraw the needle and immediately place pressure over the needle hole to prevent loss of injected cells and to minimize the spread of isotope over the external surface of the limb. Immediately dress the limb with one layer of autoadhesive bandage. The horse is now ready for gamma scintigraphy. Perform this immediately.\n\t\tNote: After injecting the cells into the tendon, acquire a count of the empty syringe and needle to assess possible direct loss of cells that may remain in the syringe.\nRegional perfusion of Tc-99m-HMPAO-labeled cells\n\t\nFollow step 2.4.\nApply a 100 mm rubber tourniquet bandage on the proximal metacarpus with two 100 mm cotton roll gauze bandage positioned medially and laterally.\nAseptically prepare the skin over the lateral palmar digital vein at the level of the lateral proximal sesamoid bone by scrubbing the area with a chlorhexidine surgical scrub solution for at least 5 min and finally with gauze soaked in alcohol.  Perform all subsequent steps in an aseptic fashion.",
    "Prepare a 100 mm extension set with a 21 G x ¾” (0.8 x 19 mm) butterfly needle for venipuncture by filling with heparinized sterile saline and then introduce the needle into the lateral palmar digital vein. Once the vein is entered blood will partially fill the extension set. At the Luer lock connector attach a Luer lock rubber cap for facilitating subsequent injection of labeled cells.\nDilute the MSCs in 19 ml of PBS by collecting the cells in a 20 ml syringe preloaded with the PBS.  Apply the cells via the rubber cup using an 18 G (1.2 x 40 mm) hypodermic needle at a slow but steady rate (30 – 40 sec).  Flush the catheter with 1 ml of PBS preloaded in a syringe.\nRemove the needle and immediately apply pressure at the skin over the needle hole with a layer of five 4 x 4 cotton gauzes. Then place a light bandage with elastic adhesive over the proximal sesamoid area and leave the tourniquet in place for 30 min after injection.\nRelease the tourniquet after 30 min. The horse is now ready for gamma scintigraphy.\n\t\tNote: After injecting the cells, acquire a count of the empty syringe and needle to assess possible direct loss of cells that may remain in the syringe.\n5. Gamma Scintigraphy\nScintigraphy images\n\t\nAcquire planar scintigraphy images with a gamma camera (set at 140 KeV photoelectric peak using a 20% symmetrical window) equipped with a low energy, parallel hole collimator.\n\t\t\nObtain all images after time 0 on standing horses sedated as in step 2.2. After the time 0 scintigram, replace the light bandage over the implantation site with a padded bandage. Remove this bandage prior to each scintigraphy exam.",
    "Acquire static images for 60 sec each (256 by 256 matrix) using the processing software with the “acquire” – “study selection” - “bone static” options. It is essential that the horse does not move during the image acquisition period because the static mode option does not have a module for correction of movement.\nFor intralesional injection, obtain lateral images from the lesion area from the carpus to the distal extremity, the equivalent area of the contralateral limb, the left lung field and the left thyroid. During the acquisition of forelimbs images, position a lead screen between the legs to avoid imaging of the limb contralateral. Acquire the images at 5 min after injection (time 0), and then at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hr.\nFor regional perfusion, obtain lateral and dorsal gamma images as for 5.1.1.3. Obtain images 5 min after tourniquet release. This will be time 0. It can be useful to image the limb immediately after injecting the cells to assess counts prior to tourniquet release. Obtain gamma images at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hr after administration of the cells.\nAfter the images have been acquired, process the images manually using the “processing” option of the software with options selected for “Sokoloff” color and “Invert” color. Next select the “region of interest” (ROI) and “ellipse” as this allows reshaping of the selection mask and movement over the lesion area. Obtain the counts over the ROI by choosing the “add to statistics” option. Ensure that identically sized regions of interest (ROI) are recorded for each animal at the different time-points.",
    "Next, correct the counts for the predicted decay of the technetium at each time point. Use the following equation to correct for decay: A = Aoe-(0.693t/T1/2), where Ao is the initial activity of the isotope, A is the decay corrected radioactivity at time zero, t is the elapsed time and T1/2 is the half-life of the isotope. Then express the corrected counts at each time point as a percentage of the ROI at time 0 to work out the percentage of cells remaining, using the following formula:\n%cells remaining (t) = 100 – {[(predicted decay(t) – decay(t))/ predicted decay(t)]} x 100\ndecay(t) = ROI(t) / ROI(0) x 100.Subscription Required.
