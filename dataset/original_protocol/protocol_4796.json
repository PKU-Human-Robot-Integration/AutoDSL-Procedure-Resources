    "Blue Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) analysisCollect plant tissue (basal half of one second leaf) into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and quickly freeze in liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissues can be stored at -80 °C for 1-2 months. Note: Since the expression of PEP subunits is higher in younger than in mature chloroplasts, proteins from young leaf sections (basal half of second leaves) were used in this study.Grind tissue in pre-chilled mortar with a pestle to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen. Let all liquid nitrogen evaporate and then immediately add 200-400 µl ice-cold BN-Lysis buffer directly to the tissue in the mortar. Do not let the tissue thaw before you add the BN-Lysis buffer.If the lysis buffer freezes, wait until it thaws before proceeding to the next step.Keep sample on ice and homogenize with 10-20 strokes of the pestle. Transfer sample into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and determine the protein concentration.Note: The concentration should be at least 4 µg/µl. Divide into 50-100 μl aliquots, snap freeze in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C for later use.Prepare gradient gel (gel dimension: 18 x 16 x 0.15 cm) from 14 ml of each of the two separation solutions (4% and 14% acrylamide) with a gradient mixer. Overlay gel with stacking solution prior it gets solid. Let polymerize at room temperature, and then cool the gel down to 4 °C. To prepare for BN-PAGE, let the sample thaw on ice and then combine 10-25 µl sample (50-100 µg) of it with 25 µl sample buffer, 17 µl 2% β-DM solution and 4.5 µl BN-Loading buffer.Note: The Bradford assay was used to determine protein concentration.Incubate sample on ice for 10 min.Centrifuge sample for 10 min at 17,500 x g and 4 °C.",
    "Load supernatant into wells and run the gel overnight (16-18 h) at 50 V constant voltage at 4 °C (or after the dye front has migrated about one third). Replace blue cathode buffer to cathode buffer without dye.Continue the electrophoresis at 10 mA constant current (~600 V) until the dye runs off (4-5 h).Remove gel from glass plates and soak gel in precooled (10 °C) transfer buffer for approx. 30 min.Transfer proteins onto PVDF membrane using semi-dry blotting apparatus (for 3 h at 0.8-3 mA/cm2 at room temperature). Destain membrane in 100% methanol for 1-3 min and immediately rinse with water.Block membrane overnight with 5% casein in 1x TBST buffer at 4 °C.Rinse membrane briefly with water and then proceed with immunoprobing according to a standard protocol (Sambrook and Russell, 2001).Sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis. The protocol for sample preparation described above can be used with the following modifications:Harvest tissue from 2-3 seedlings (second whole leaves). Use 1.5 ml buffer for lysis (step A3).After homogenization (step A5) on ice transfer sample into a 15 ml conical tube.Sonicate sample (tip width 2-3 mm) for three cycles of 10 sec at 20% power output. Let samples sit on ice for 1-2 min between sonication (Note 1). Transfer lysate into a 2.0 ml microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge at 20,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. Take an aliquot of each fraction and detect individual PEP subunits by immunoblot analysis (Note 1).Transfer supernatant into a fresh 15 ml tube and determine protein concentration.Note: Concentration should be at least 3 µg/µl.Snap freeze sample (supernatant) in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C for later use. Thaw samples on ice for > 30 min and add 1.5 ml diluent solution.",
    "Diluent solution is used to dilute the glycerol concentration in the sample prior to sucrose gradient centrifugation.Concentrate sample to 1.0 ml using cut-off centrifugal filter device, when necessary.Prepare 12-ml continuous gradients of 10 to 30% sucrose (from 6 ml each) in 14 ml polyallomer centrifugal tubes with a gradient mixer (sucrose gradient preparation in Zhu, 2012). Load slowly 1.0 ml sample (approx. 5 mg) on top of a gradient and centrifuge tubes for 15 h at 146,000 x g in an SW-40 rotor (4 °C).Carefully collect 500-µl-fractions from the top of the gradient.Use equal volumes (30-50 µl) of every second fraction for SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblot analysis with an antibody specific for a PEP subunit.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160718/20160718222017_3444.jpgFigure 1.
