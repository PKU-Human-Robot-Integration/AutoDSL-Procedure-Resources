    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nThis protocol provides detailed procedures for one-step genome editing (Gene deletion, Gene insertion and Single nucleotide substitution) in the native type I-F CRISPR-Cas-containing MDR P. aeruginosa isolate PA154197 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). A platform plasmid (pAY5211, Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A) for constructing the customized targeting plasmid and editing plasmid is available upon request. pAY5211 contains a mini-CRISPR insertion site which is flanked by the KpnI and BamHI sites, a donor insertion site at the XhoI site, and a kanamycin-luminescence dual selection marker. Sequence information of pAY5211 is presented in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/87-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Sequence Information of the Platform Plasmid pAY5211 and the pEditing pAY5235 Constructed for mexB Deletion\n(A) pAY5211 contains a kanamycin-resistant gene and a luciferase-encoding operon (luxCDABE) for the dual selection of transformants. Mini-CRISPR is inserted between KpnI and BamHI which is co-transcribed with the luxCDABE operon driven by the Ptat promoter. Donor fragments are assembled at the XhoI site. Primers pMS402-F/R are used to verify the constructs of pTargeting and pEditing.\n(B) Sequence information of the mini-CRISPR and donor in pAY5235 employed to construct mexB deletion is shown.\nConstruction of the Targeting Plasmid (pTargeting)\nTiming: 2–3 days\nSelect a region of ∼200 bp (236 bp in our case) in the pUC57-mini-CRISPR covering the mini-CRISPR and the flanking KpnI and BamHI sites. Amplify this region by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using iProof™ High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Bio-Rad, USA). Reaction mixture (a) and PCR cycles (b) are set up as below:\niProof PCR Reaction setup:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_87_1.csv\nPCR cycles:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_87_2.csv\nPurify the 236-bp PCR product using the MiniBEST Agarose Gel DNA Extraction Kit (TaKaRa, Japan) following the manufacture’s instruction.\nAlternatives: If the KpnI-mini-CRISPR-BamHI fragment is synthesized and supplied in the linear double-stranded DNA form, it can be directly proceeded to Step 3.",
    "Purified PCR product from Step 2 and the plasmid pAY5211 are digested with KpnI and BamHI (NEB, USA). Digestion reaction is set up as below:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_87_3.csv\nIncubate reactions at 37°C for 4 h.\nPurify the digested pAY5211 and 88-bp mini-CRISPR (with KpnI and BamHI digested ends) using the illustra GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit (GE Healthcare, USA) and the MiniBEST Agarose Gel DNA Extraction Kit, respectively.\nNote: Use MiniBEST Agarose Gel DNA Extraction Kit or equivalent kits to purify the small-sized mini-CRISPR. The mini-CRISPR can be directly purified from the KpnI and BamHI digestion reaction. Thus, no gel purification is required. Use 20 μL Milli-Q H2O to elute the DNA fragments to ensure sufficient quantity for ligation in the next step.\nLigate the enzyme-digested pAY5211 (∼0.5 μg) and mini-CRISPR (∼0.1 μg) using the Quick Ligation Kit (NEB, USA) to generate pTargeting. Reaction mixture without addition of digested mini-CRISPR serves as the negative control. Ligation reaction is set up as below:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_87_4.csv\nIncubate the reaction at 25°C for 45 min.\nMix the ligation mixture with 100 μL cold CaCl2 (0.1 mM) and 200 μL DH5α component cells gently and thoroughly. Chill on ice for 10 min.\nHeat shock the mixture at 42°C for 90 s and quickly chill it on ice for 5 min.\nAdd 1 mL fresh LB broth into the mixture and recover the cells at 37°C with 220-rpm agitation for 1 h.\nHarvest the cells by centrifugation with 16,000 ×g for 1 min and resuspend them in 100 μL LB broth. Spread 100 μL cell suspension onto a LB agar plate containing 20 μg/mL kanamycin and incubate the plate at 37°C overnight (15–16 h) to obtain colonies. No colony should be recovered in the negative control (without digested mini-CRISPR).",
    "Note: Overnight incubation in this protocol is approximately 15–16 h.\nPerform colony PCR to verify the construction of pTargeting (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], Step 3). Colony PCR reaction using the platform plasmid pAY5211 as the template serves as the negative control. PCR reaction (a) and cycles (b) are set up as below:\nColony PCR Reaction setup:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_87_5.csv\nColony PCR cycle:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_87_6.csv\nRun an 1% agarose gel to examine the PCR product.\nVisualize bands with UV transillumination after the gel is stained by GelRed. PCR product of the expected pTargeting is 468 bp due to the replacement of 2-bp sequence flanked by KpnI and BamHI in pAY5211 by the 88-bp mini-CRISPR in pTargeting. PCR product of the negative control pAY5211 is 382 bp.\nInoculate a validated colony into 5 mL LB broth supplemented with 20 μg/mL kanamycin and propagate the plasmid by growing the inoculum at 37°C with 220-rpm agitation overnight. Extract pTargeting from the overnight culture using the QIAprepTM Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen, Germany).\nPause Point: Plasmids can be stored at -20°C for ∼3 months\nSelf-Targeting Activity Assay\nTiming: 2–3 days\nNote: This step is conducted to examine the self-targeting DNA interference activity of the native CRISPR-Cas system and to further validate the PAM sequence. This step only needs to be conducted once prior to the first genome-editing exploitation in the strain of interest.",
    "pTargeting and the control plasmid pAY5211 are delivered into PA154197 cells, respectively, by electroporation following the steps from 24 to 31 (below). Since pTargeting contains a mini-CRISPR guide which targets a genomic locus in PA154197 and is expressed by a strong promoter Ptat, if the CRISPR-Cas system in PA154197 is active, the crRNA expressed from the mini-CRISPR will form a Cascade with the Cas complex and elicit site-specific DNA breakage in the genome, resulting in cell death. Hence, no colony should be recovered following pTargeting transformation relative to the high colony recovery of the pAY5211 transformation. As shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5], expected colony recovery pattern was observed. The result showed that the native type I-F CRISPR-Cas system in PA154197 is active to interfere genomic DNA and confirmed the authenticity of the predicted PAM sequence. Moreover, the fact that no colony was recovered upon introduction of the pTargeting indicated that as in most bacteria, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) does not occur in this strain. Once the self-targeting activity of the native CRISPR-Cas system is confirmed and the PAM sequence is validated, direct genome editing in this strain can be performed followingly (Steps 16 to 36).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/87-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Representative Results of Genome Editing following Transformation of the Single pEditing Plasmid and Verification of the Desired Construct (mexB Deletion as an Example)\n(A) Plates showing the colony recovery pattern following the transformation of the control plasmid pAY5211, the pTargeting, and the pEditing. Provision of the repair donor in pEditing resumed colony recovery, indicating the success of DNA repair through the donor-mediated homologous recombination (HR) and consequently the desired mexB deletion.",
    "(B) A representative gel image of colony PCR to verify ΔmexB in PA154197. PCR reaction using the wild-type (WT) strain as template yielded a band of 4,228 bp whereas that using recovered colonies from pEditing transformation as template yielded a band of 1,087 bp, indicating the deletion of 3,141-bp mexB gene.\nConstruction of the Editing Plasmid (pEditing)\nTiming: 2–3 days\nAmplify the donor DNA fragments using the genomic DNA of PA154197 as template and primer pairs (Donor-UF/UR and Donor-DF/DR) as indicated in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]. Amplify and purify the donor DNA fragments following the procedures as described in Steps 1 and 2.\nNote: Adjust annealing temperature for different primer pairs.\nLinearize pTargeting (∼12.5 μg) through XhoI digestion. XhoI digestion reaction is set up as below:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_87_7.csv\nIncubate XhoI digestion reaction at 37°C for 4 h.\nPurify the linearized pTargeting using the illustra GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit.\nUse One Step Cloning Kit (Vazyme, China) to assemble the donor fragments into pTargeting (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Assembly reaction without addition of donor fragments serves as the negative control. Assembly reaction is set up as below:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_87_8.csv\nIncubate reactions at 37°C for 30 min.\nTransform the reaction mixture into E. coli DH5α component cells as described in Steps 8 to 11. Following overnight incubation at 37°C on LB agar plates containing 20 μg/mL kanamycin, perform colony PCR using the primer pairs pMS402-F/R to verify the construct (pEditing) as described from Step 12 to 15. No colony should be recovered in the negative control (without addition of donor fragments).\nNote: Expected size of the PCR product should be 1,468 bp if the upstream and downstream donors are 500 bp, respectively. The negative control colony PCR reaction using pTargeting as template will yield a product size of 468 bp.",
    "Sequence the plasmid (pEditing) using primer pairs (pMS402-F/R) to confirm the desired incorporation of mini-CRISPR and repair donor. An example of sequence information of the pEditing (pAY5235) to construct mexB-deletion was shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B.\nCritical: Concentration of pEditing should be >500 ng/μL. Lower concentration will lead to increased volume of plasmid for electroporation at Step 27, which reduces electroporation and editing efficiencies.\nFast Preparation of Electro-component Cells and Electroporation of pEditing\nTiming: 2–3 days\nOvernight PA154197 cell culture is diluted 1:100 into 50 mL fresh LB broth and grow at 37°C with 220-rpm agitation for 4–5 h till OD600 is ∼0.6–0.8.\nCritical: Harvest cells at OD600 as ∼0.6–0.8 (mid-late log phase). Early log phase cells will result in low editing efficiency and stationary phase cells such as overnight cultured cells will increase the false positive transformants.\nCell culture is chilled on ice for at least 30 min. Cells are collected by centrifugation at 4°C with 5,000 ×g for 15 min and washed three times with 25 mL cold Milli-Q H2O.\nCritical: Wash the cells gently and carefully to avoid the loss of cells during the process.\nResuspend the resulting cell pellet (electrocompetent PA154197 cells) into 1 mL Milli-Q H2O.\nMix 100 μL electrocompetent PA154197 cells with 1 μg pEditing, or pAY5211 (control plasmid) or pTargeting (negative control). Transfer the mixtures into electroporation cuvettes and apply electrical pulse at 2.3 kV, 6 ms (BTX, USA).\nAdd 1 mL cold LB broth into each cuvette immediately after electroporation.\nTransfer the cells into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and incubate at 37°C with 220-rpm agitation for 90 min.",
    "Critical: Do not incubate over 90 min, as prolonged growth will lead to cell lysis presumably due to over-expression of the CRISPR RNA (crRNA) in PA154197, as only the transformants of pEditing, but not the control plasmid pAY5211, displayed this phenomenon (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/87-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Prolonged Growth during Recovery of PA154197 Cells Electroporated with pEditing Resulted in Undesirable Cell Lysis\nSuspension of cells electroporated with the control plasmid pAY5211 or pEditing following recovery for 120 min. Cell lysis and subsequent precipitation (red arrow) was observed in the cell suspension electroporated with pEditing but not with the control plasmid pAY5211.\nHarvest the cells by centrifugation and resuspend them in 100 μL LB broth. Spread the suspension onto LB agar plates containing 500 μg/mL kanamycin.\nNote: Concentration of kanamycin for selection is dependent on the kanamycin susceptibility of the P. aeruginosa isolates subjected to editing. For example, 800 μg/mL is used for selection of another clinical isolate PA150567 and 500 μg/mL for an environmental isolate Ocean-100 (Kumagai et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nIncubate the plates at 37°C for 24 h.\nMutants Screening and Verification\nTiming: 6–8 h\nInoculate the colonies recovered from Step 31 in 100 μL LB broth supplemented with 100 μg/mL kanamycin in a 96-well white plate (SPL, Korea).\nIncubate the 96-well white plate at 37°C with 220-rpm agitation for 3 h.\nMeasure the luminescence intensity using the Synergy HTX Plate Reader (Bio Tek, USA).\nSelect cell cultures with high luminescence value (>1000) for further colony PCR verification using primers located upstream and downstream of the donor regions (Veri-F/R, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nNote: Luminescence reading of cultures containing pEditing is usually more than 1,000 after incubation, while the false positive colonies have undetectable luminescence intensity. For colony PCR verification, include a negative control reaction using the genomic DNA of PA154197 as template.",
    "Verify the desired genome editing by DNA sequencing of the PCR product.\nCuring of pEditing for the Next Round of Editing\nTiming: 15–16 h\nStreak the edited colony from Step 35 on a LB agar plate (without kanamycin supplement).\nIncubate the plate at 37°C overnight. Plasmid curing is confirmed by inoculating the colony into LB broth supplemented with 100 μg/mL kanamycin. No growth after overnight culture indicates the loss of the editing plasmid.\nSingle colony with desired mutation can be used for next round of editing or other physiological studies.\nNote: In some cases, multiple (2 to 3) rounds of curing are required for complete loss of the plasmid."
