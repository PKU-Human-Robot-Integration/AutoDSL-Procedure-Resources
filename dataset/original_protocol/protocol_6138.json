    "T-maze assembly (Video 1)<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Demonstration of the T-maze construction The plexiglass components of the maze are assembled by first attaching the side panels and the elevator to the base with the aluminum screws. When all four screws are in place, tighten them crosswise to the point that they are tight without forcing them further. If forced too tight it may damage the plexiglass screw threads. Once the sides are fastened on the base, attach the vacuum adaptors onto the vacuum ports. Make sure that the elevator is snug, but it can move up and down without difficulty.Fly preparationBackcross control flies carrying the w1118 mutation to the Canton-S for at least 10 generations to obtain the Cantonised-w1118. Outcross all the Drosophila lines with Cantonised-w1118 for six generations to obtain the same genetic background for all animals used in the behavioral experiments.Raise the flies in standard wheat-flour-sugar food supplemented with soy flour and CaCl2 under a 14:10 h light-dark cycle, 60% relative humidity, at 25 °C, unless you use the TARGET system. In that case, raise the flies at 18 °C until hatching.To collect flies for the experiment, anesthetize them under CO2 at least one day before the experiment and separate them in groups of 50-60 flies. Place each group of flies in food vials at 25 °C, 14:10 h light-dark conditions and 60% humidity, if no transgene will be expressed during the experiment (for control experiments or mutants). For experiments with Gal4 lines, place the flies at 30 °C overnight to enhance transgene expression. For experiments using the TARGET system, place the flies at 30 °C for 2 or 3 days prior to testing. The days of transgene induction depend on the transgene used in each experiment.",
    "For neuronal silencing experiments with Shibirets, place the flies at 32-33 °C for 30 min before the experiment, while for experiments with TRPA1 for neuronal activation, transfer the flies at 30-31 °C for the time period you want to keep the neurons activated.Preparation before the experimentTransfer the flies in new food vials approximately 1 h before the experiment. Place the vials in a dark box and keep it at the temperature flies were kept before. For experiments with Shibirets, transfer the flies in new pre-warmed vials, kept at 32-33 °C, 30 min before the experiment. To ensure that neuronal transmission is blocked for the same time interval for all groups of flies, transfer the flies at 32-33 °C sequentially during the experiment.Prepare the behavior room. Clean the T-mazes and arms with soft cloth. Ensure that the arms fit tightly on the maze and the air flow is stable at 500 ppm (0.5 ml/min). If you use the T-maze for the first time, run a control experiment without odors to verify that there is no bias towards one arm of the maze. Check that humidity in the room ranges from 60% to 70% and the temperature from 23 to 24 °C. Experiments are performed under dim red light (photography dark room grade, Figure 7).Prepare the odor and connect it to the T-maze set up. Let the odor flow for 30 min, to prime the system for the experiment. For Octanol add 1 ml 3-Octanol in a glass vial. For experiments conducted with Benzaldehyde, add 100 μl of Benzaldehyde in a 14 ml Falcon. Similarly, for experiments with ethyl acetate or 2,3-butanedione prepare priming in a 14 ml Falcon with 10 μl of a 0.1% dilution of ethyl acetate in water and for 2,3-butanedione with 10 μl of a 0.5% dilution.",
    "The concentration of each compound and the surface area of the container (odorant meniscus) were determined empirically to produce the optimal response. Previous studies have demonstrated that the same odor compound can be either aversive or attractive, depending on the concentration employed (Wang et al., 2003). For odorants different than the ones described herein, avoidance experiments are required prior to habituation to standardize the odor concentrations. These odorants can be diluted either in water (ethyl acetate and 2,3-butanedione) or isopropyl myristate (Octanol, Benzaldehyde [Gouzi et al., 2018])imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190531/20190531013954_2668.jpgFigure 7. The equipment set under the conditions of the experiment. All experiments must be conducted under dim red light.Odor Avoidance and Attraction TestingUse a clamp to hold the parts of the T-maze together tightly (Figure 2). Load the flies in a clean arm and connect it on the upper part of the maze. Move the middle part of the maze (the elevator) so that the elevator receptacle (Figure 3) will be aligned with the arm. Tap the maze gently to transfer the flies into the receptacle and slide the elevator down quickly to trap the flies inside the maze.Connect the air and odor tubing, so that air will flow on one side of the maze and odor on the other.Connect the vacuum.Slide the elevator down and let the flies choose between the two arms for 90 s for aversive odors and 180 s for attractive odors. Make sure that during testing the flow remains at 500 ppm.Move the elevator up to trap the flies inside the two arms.Transfer the content of each arm to separate (numbered) tubes.Clean the elevator receptacle to remove any remaining flies, attach the arms back on the maze and proceed with the next n.Repeat the procedure until you finish with all the repetitions of the experiment.",
    "Transfer the rack where you have collected the flies to -80 °C. Wait for approximately 15 min and then count the flies. Note the number of flies trapped in the air-arm and the odor-arm, as well as their genotype.Habituation Training and Testing (Video 2)<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Olfactory Habituation Training and Testing Load the flies in an arm used specifically for training exposure to a particular odor and connect the arm on the upper part of the maze. Make sure you use different arms for each odor used in the assay if more than one odor is to be used.Slide the elevator so that the flies will stay trapped in the arm (elevator training point, Figure 3), but the odor can flow through it.Connect the vacuum tubing and then the odor tubing. Make sure that the odor flow is at 500 ppm.Leave the flies in the arm with the odor flow for the designated amount of time–1 min for habituation latency experiments, and 4 min or 30 min for habituation experiments. For odor pulse experiments substitute 1 min odor exposure with 2 x 30 s (with 8 s interstimulus interval), 4 min with 4 x 1 min (with 15 s interstimulus interval), and 30 min with 3 x 10 min (with 2.5 min interstimulus interval) odor pulses.Disconnect the odor tubing but leave the vacuum tubing connected such that air will flow through the arm. Wait for 30 s.Slide the elevator so that the receptacle will be aligned with the training arm. Tap the maze gently to transfer the flies in the receptacle and slide the elevator down quickly to trap the flies inside the maze (Video 2).Continue the procedure from “Step C2”.Dishabituation with electric shockSet the Grass Stimulator to 1.2 s stimulus duration at 45 V.",
    "Load the flies in an arm with a custom-made copper grid (Figure 6) and connect the arm on the upper part of the maze. Train the flies with 1, 4, or 30-min odor exposure as above. During this interval, connect the crocodile clips holding the electric shock wires with the extending parts of the copper grid.Disconnect the odor tubing and immediately apply one electric shock.Disconnect the crocodile clips and wait for 30 s with the vacuum on, so that air will flow through the arm.Slide the elevator so that the receptacle will be aligned with the copper-grid arm. Tap the maze gently to transfer the flies in the hollow of the elevator. Slide the elevator down quickly to trap the flies inside the maze.Continue the procedure from “Step C2”.Previous studies have shown that concurrent exposure to an odor and twelve 45 V electric shocks results in associative learning formation (Berry et al., 2018). Dishabituation, however, requires stimulation with a single electric shock following the odor exposure and therefore no associative learning formation is anticipated from the application of the protocol.Dishabituation with vortexTrain the flies with 1, 4, or 30-min odor exposure as above.Disconnect the odor tubing and remove the arm from the maze, sealing it with your hand. Apply vortex for 3 s at maximum speed.Connect the arm on the maze again and connect the vacuum tubing so that air will flow through the arm. Wait for 30 s.Slide the elevator so that the receptacle will be aligned with the training arm. Tap the maze gently to transfer the flies in the elevator receptacle and slide the elevator down quickly to trap the flies inside the maze.Continue the procedure from “Step C2”.",
    "Dishabituation with yeast puffPrepare a 30% solution of yeast in water, an arm and tubing that will be used specifically for this odor. Make sure that the odor flows with 500 ppm.Train the flies with 1, 4, or 30-min odor exposure as above. Disconnect the odor tubing and remove the arm from the maze, sealing it with your hand. Transfer the flies to the new arm, specifically used for yeast puff dishabituation. Connect the tubing for yeast puff for 3 s.Remove the yeast puff tubing and leave the vacuum tubing on so that air will flow through the arm. Wait for 30 s.Slide the elevator so that the receptacle will be aligned with the training arm. Tap the maze gently to transfer the flies in the receptacle and slide the elevator down quickly to trap the flies inside the maze.Continue the procedure from “Step C2”.Spontaneous recoveryProceed as described in ‘Procedure D: Habituation training and testing’. After Step D5, transfer the flies to food vials for 6 min. Continue with Step D6."
