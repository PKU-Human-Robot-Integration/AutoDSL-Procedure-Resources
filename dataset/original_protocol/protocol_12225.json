    "NOTE: Patients should give informed consent to participate in the Institutional Review Board and Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Committee approved study.\n1. Isolation and Culture of TILs\nObtain tumor material that is not required for histopathologic diagnosis from the pathology service/tissue procurement core. Place 20-100 g of tumor specimens in a 50-ml tube with 30 ml tumor collecting media (Table 1).\nDissect solid, firm, normal tissue of the tumor specimen from fragile and/or bloody necrotic areas using scissors. After removing the necrotic tissue, use the scissors to mince the specimen as small as possible.\nDissociate the minced specimen into a single-cell suspension using a dissociator and tumor dissociation kit (human) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Filter the suspension with a 70 µm cell strainer that is set on a 50 ml tube and wash the strainer 2 times with 2 ml of RPMI 1640.\nCentrifuge at 200 x g at room temperature for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 10 ml of T cell media (Table 1).\nPrepare a two-step gradient solution such as Ficoll (gradient solution) in a 50-ml tube, with a lower step of 10 ml of 100% gradient solution and a middle step of 30 ml of 75% gradient solution diluted with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, no calcium, no magnesium (D-PBS(-)).\nLayer the cell suspension (from Step 1.4) on the gradient solution (from Step 1.5). Centrifuge at 400 x g at 20 °C for 45 min.\nCollect the layer containing the enriched TILs at the interface between the 100% gradient solution and the 75% gradient solution in a 50 ml tube. Dilute the layer of the solution with the enriched TILs by adding 20-30 ml of D-PBS(-).",
    "Centrifuge at 200 x g at room temperature for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the TIL-enriched fraction in 10 ml of T cell media.\nCulture the fraction (from Step 1.8) with 2 ml of T cell media and 6,000 IU/ml recombinant human (rh) IL-2 in a 6-well plate at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nChange half the media on day 5 after culture initiation and every 2-3 days thereafter.\nSplit the cells at a ratio of 1:2 without trypsinization after softly suspending, doubling the number of wells when reaching 80-90% confluency. Add a half volume (1 ml) of fresh T cell media and rhIL-2 at 6,000 IU/ml.\n2. Preparation of Mitomycin-C-treated SNL Feeder Cell Plate\nCulture SNL feeder cells in 10 ml of SNL feeder cell media (Table 1) on a 0.1% gelatin-coated 10 cm dish until 80-90% confluence (3-4 x 106 cells) is reached.\nAdd 310 µl of 0.4 mg/ml mitomycin C solution directly into the SNL feeder cell culture dish and incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 2 hr and 15 min. Aspirate the media and wash the cells twice with 5 ml D-PBS(-).\nAdd 0.5 ml of 0.25% trypsin/1 mM EDTA and incubate at room temperature for 1 min to dissociate the cells. Add 4.5 ml of SNL feeder cell media to neutralize and re-suspend the cells into a single suspension.\nTransfer the cells into a 15 ml tube and centrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min. Aspirate the media and count the cells with a hemocytometer after re-suspending in 10 ml of SNL feeder cell media.\nPlate 1.5 x 106 cells per well of the SNL feeder cells on a 10 cm dish and incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Use the SNL feeder cells within 3 days.",
    "3. Generation of iPSCs Using the Sendai Virus (SeV) Vector\nHarvest the TILs (from Step 1.11) and activate 5 x 105 cells of TILs with plate-bound mouse anti-human CD3 (1 µg/ml) and soluble mouse anti-human CD28 (5 µg/ml), with rhIL-2 (6,000 IU/ml) in 2 ml of T cell media in a 6-well plate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 5 days.\nHarvest the TILs (from Step 3.1) in a 15 ml tube using a pipette and count the cell number with a hemocytometer.\nReactivate 1 x 105 cells of TILs with plate-bound mouse anti-human CD3 (1 µg/ml) and soluble mouse anti-human CD28 (5 µg/ml), with rhIL-2 (60 IU/ml) in 500 µl of reprogramming media (Table 1) per well in a 24-well plate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 hr. Prepare 3 wells for SeV infection: OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC (1 well); SeV infection (GFP: green fluorescent protein) (1 well); and cell count (1 well).\nAfter 24 hr (from Step 3.3), count the cell number with a hemocytometer and determine the volume of each virus for various (3-20) multiplicities of infection (MOI). Remove one set of Sendai virus vector tubes from the -80 °C storage. Thaw the SeV vectors quickly in a water bath (37 °C) and place them on ice.\n\tVolume of virus (µl) = MOI (CIU/cell) x number of cells/titer of virus (CIU/ml) × 10-3 (µl/ml)\nAdd the calculated volumes of each of the four Sendai virus vector tubes that individually carried OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC by adding a mixture of SeV vectors at 10-20 MOI into the media, including activated TILs.\nTo determine the transduction efficiency, add the calculated volumes of SeV-GFP into a well of activated TILs.",
    "Place the dish (from Step 3.5 and Step 3.6) in the incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 hr. After 24 hr, estimate the infection efficiency using TILs infected with SeV-GFP under fluorescence microscopy.\nCollect the cells (from Step 3.5) in a 15 ml tube. Centrifuge at 200 x g at room temperature for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 0.5 ml of hESC media with Primate ES Cell Medium and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, 4 ng/ml).\nTransfer the suspension into a 10 cm dish that contains mitomycin-C-treated SNL feeder cells in 10 ml of hESC media. Change the hESC media every other day until the colonies are grown.\nAround day 18 to 21, remove the SNL feeder cells around the colonies under a microscope using a 10-µl tip in the clean bench.\nScrape the colonies using a 10-µl tip and transfer them using a 200-µl tip into 100 µl of iPSCs media per well of a 96-well tissue culture plate. Pipet up and down at 2-3 times to break the colonies into small clumps with an average size of 50-100 µm.\nTransfer the small clumps into 6-well tissue culture plates with mitomycin-C-treated SNL feeder cells (from Step 2) in 2 ml per well of iPSCs media with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, 4 ng/ml). Change iPSCs media every day.\nTransfer the iPSCs to 6-well tissue culture plates with fresh mitomycin-C-treated SNL feeder cells with 1 mg/ml collagenase IV every 5-6 days. Prepare 2 wells per plates of each clone for immunostaining.\nDetermine the full reprogramming of each clone by immunohistochemical staining of pluripotency markers (SSEA3, SSEA4, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, and OCT3/4)1.",
    "NOTE: For further evaluation of pluripotency potential, confirm that fully-reprogrammed iPSC lines can differentiate into three germ layers by an embryoid body formation and differentiation assay or a teratoma formation assay16.\nConfirm that fully-reprogrammed iPSC lines demonstrate a normal karyotype by cytogenetic analysis.\nFor teratoma formation, inject an undifferentiated TIL-derived iPSC (1 x 106) suspension in 100 µl of DMEM containing 10% FCS into the subcutaneous tissue of 6-8 week old female NOD/SCID mice. Stain teratoma sections with hematoxylin and eosin.\n4. Immunofluorescence Staining of iPSCs for SSEA3, SSEA4, TRA1-60 and TRA1-81\nWash iPSCs with 1 ml of PBS and fix the iPSCs with 1 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 10 min. Remove the 4% paraformaldehyde solution and wash the iPSCs with 1 ml of PBS 3 times.\n\tNOTE: Be careful when using paraformaldehyde because it is toxic.\nPretreat the iPSCs with blocking buffer (Table 1) for 30 min. Meanwhile, dilute the primary antibodies (rat anti-human SSEA3, mouse anti-human SSEA4, mouse anti-human TRA1-60, and mouse anti-human TRA1-81) 1:50 in 1.5% goat serum solution diluted with PBS and TritonX-100 (total volume: 1 ml).\nRemove the blocking buffer (Table 1). Add the diluted primary antibody solution and incubate for 1 hr at room temperature. Meanwhile, dilute the secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG and IgM or anti-rat IgM) 1:50 in 1.5% goat serum solution.\nRemove the diluted primary antibody solution and wash the iPSCs with 1 ml PBS 3 times, each for 5 min. Add the diluted secondary antibody solution and incubate for 45 min at room temperature in a dark room.\nRemove the diluted secondary antibody solution and wash the iPSCs with 1 ml of PBS 3 times, each for 5 min. Observe the iPSCs with immunofluorescence microscopy.\n5. Immunofluorescence Staining of iPSCs for Oct3/4",
