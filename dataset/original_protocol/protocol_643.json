  "procedures": [
    "1. Culture cells in 96-well plate by time point. \n  2. Equilibrate the plate to room temperature for 30 min.\n  3. Prepare control wells containing medium without cells for background. \n  4. Add a volume of luciferin solution equal to the volume of cell culture medium in a well \\(luciferin solution \\(vol.) : cell culture medium \\(vol.) = 1 : 1).\n  5. Mix the contents of plate by gently shaking for 5 sec.\n  6. Immediately detect the luminescence with a luminescent plate reader. Suitable measurement time is 1~10 sec depending on equipment type."
