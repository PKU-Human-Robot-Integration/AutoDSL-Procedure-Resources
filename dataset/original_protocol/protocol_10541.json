    "NOTE: All procedures are approved by the regional animal committee and in accordance with international guidelines on the ethical use of animals.\n1. Preparation of Materials and Instruments\nPreparation of spontaneously formed vesicle dispersion (SFV)\n\t\nDissolve and prepare stock solutions of the following phospholipids: 214 mg/ml egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC), 134 mg/ml cholesterol, 122 mg/ml 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (ammonium salt) (mPEG2000-DSPE) and 2 mg/ml 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl) (ammonium salt) (NBD-DOPE) in chloroform and store in glass vials.\nFurnish approximately 3 ml chloroform in a round bottom flask and transfer the appropriate volume of phospholipid stock solution into the round bottom flask to prepare liposomes composed of EPC:Chol:mPEG2000-DSPE at a molar ratio of 6.5:3:0.5. For double fluorescence labeling of liposomes add 0.3 mol% NBD-DOPE to the lipid solution.\nEvaporate the chloroform from the organic phospholipid solution under reduced pressure (300 mbar) at 55 °C using a rotary evaporator.\nAfter a homogeneous phospholipid film is formed, reduce the pressure to 10 mbar for 1-2 hr to remove residual chloroform deposit.\nWhile the chloroform is evaporating, dissolve DY-676-COOH (6.181 µM) in 10 mM Tris buffer pH 7.4 and fill a Dewar vessel with liquid nitrogen. Switch on an ultrasonic bath and set at 50 °C.\nTransfer an appropriate volume (0.5–1 ml) of DY-676-COOH (6.181 µM) solution to the round bottom flask to hydrate the dry phospholipid film and vortex vigorously until a spontaneously formed vesicle (SFV) dispersion forms. Make sure that all of the phospholipids are dispersed to avoid lipid loss.",
    "Carefully transfer the round bottom flask containing the SFV dispersion into liquid nitrogen and freeze the dispersion for 3–5 min. Place the round bottom flask into an ultrasonic bath at 50 °C to thaw the dispersion then vortex the dispersion vigorously for 1–2 min. Repeat this procedure six times, making a total of seven freeze and thaw cycles.\nExtrusion of SFV to form homogeneous liposome vesicles\n\t\nTransfer the SFV dispersion into a 1 ml syringe (syringe-a) and extrude the dispersion through a 100 nm polycarbonate membrane using a LiposoFast-Basic extruder into syringe-b.\nExtrude the dispersion from syringe-b, back into syringe-a, then repeat the cycle ten times. Due to extrusion, the solution in the syringe changes from a hazy appearance to a clear dispersion with time. After ten cycles (twenty single extrusion steps) remove syringe-b from the device and extrude the dispersion for the last time from syringe-a directly into a sterile 1.5 ml reaction tube.\nPurification of liposomal encapsulated DY-676-COOH from free dye\n\t\nPrepare a gel chromatography column using G25 beads soaked in 10 mM Tris buffer pH 7.4 (column length 28 cm, diameter 0.8 cm).\nTransfer 0.5 ml of extruded vesicle dispersion onto the gel bed and let the sample drain into the gel matrix.\nElute the liposomes with 10 mM Tris buffer pH 7.4 (Figure 1A) and wash the column until the free dye drains completely out of the column. If need be, collect and recycle the free dye by desalting and dehydration according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nConcentrate the eluted liposomes by ultracentrifugation (200,000 x g, 2 hr at 8 °C) then disperse them in adequate volume of sterile 10 mM Tris buffer pH, 7.4.\nQuantification of encapsulated DY-676-COOH concentration",
    "Prepare a calibration curve by dissolving DY-676-COOH (0, 82, 124, 247, 494, 988 nM) in 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4 containing 0.1% Triton X100.\nDissolve 2 µl (100 nmol final lipid of a 50 mmol/L stock) of the liposomes for 5 min at room temperature in 100 µl Tris buffer containing 1% Triton X100 to destroy the vesicles and release the encapsulated dye. Then dilute samples with 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4 to a final Triton-X100 concentration of 0.1% (v/v) making a total volume of 1 ml. Prepare all samples in duplicate.\nMeasure the absorption and emission of all samples (free DY-676-COOH and Triton-X100 treated liposomes) at an excitation λ=645 nm and an emission λ = 700 nm. Establish and use a calibration curve of the free dye to determine the concentration of encapsulated dye.\nLiposome characterization\n\t\nDetermine the sizes and zeta potential of liposomes by dynamic light scattering. Dilute the liposomal samples with filter sterilized (0.2 µm) 10 mM Tris buffer pH 7.4 to a concentration of 100–300 µM (lipid). Transfer the diluted samples into a low volume disposable cuvette and measure the sample according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nCharacterize the liposomes by electron microscopy to substantiate the size, integrity and homogeneity of liposomal vesicles according to standard protocols.\n2. Validation of Fluorescence-quenching and Activation of Prepared Liposomes\nPhysicochemical analysis of fluorescence quenching and activation",
    "Prepare two 1.5 ml tubes for the Lip-Q and 2 tubes for the free DY-676-COOH. Transfer 100 nmol total lipids (2.38 µl of a 42 mmol/L Lip-Q stock solution, containing 138 µg/ml of the encapsulated DY-676-COOH) into the corresponding tubes. Transfer free DY-676-COOH equivalent to the dye content of Lip-Q (0.38 µg which results for example from 138 µg/1,000 µl x 2.38 µl Lip-Q used). Incubate one tube of each probe at 4 °C and freeze the second tube at -80 °C overnight (16 hr).\nHeat up a heating block to 30 °C. Fill a cooling box with crushed ice and equilibrate an aliquot of 10 mM Tris buffer pH 7.4 to room temperature.\nRemove probes from 4 °C and equilibrate at room temperature (wrapped in aluminum foil to protect from light) and quickly thaw probes from -80 °C at 30 °C for 5 min. Chill the thawed probes on ice for 1 min before transferring them to room temperature (also wrapped in aluminum foil to protect from light).\nAdd 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4) to each of the probes to 100 µl final volume and equilibrate all probes at RT for 10 min.\nPipette 80 µl of each probe into a low volume glass cuvette and measure the absorption of each probe from 400–900 nm on a spectrometer. Return the probe to their corresponding tubes.\nTransfer 80 µl of each probe into a suitable glass cuvette and measure the fluorescence emission on a spectrofluorometer by exciting the probes at 674 nm and measuring the fluorescence from 694–800 nm.\nCellular uptake and fluorescence activation",
    "Get and culture the following cell lines in their corresponding culture media according to standard conditions (37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidified atmosphere). Here, use the murine macrophage cell line J774A.1 (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum), the human glioblastoma cell line, U-118MG (MEM containing essential vitamins and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum) and the human fibrosarcoma cell line, HT-1080 (RPMI with 5% FCS).\nCoat 8-well chamber slides with poly-L-lysine (add 100 µl 0.001% poly-L-lysine to each well and incubate at 37 °C for 10 min. Aspirate solution and let the chamber slides to dry up for at least 4 hr at RT on a sterile workbench. Rinse the chamber slides 3 times with 200 µl Hank’s buffered saline solution then seal them with paraffin and aluminum foil and store at 4 °C till needed.\nWhile the chamber slides are drying up, filter-sterilize the liposomes and dye solution and store at 4 °C till needed.\nFor probe uptake analysis with the whole body in vivo NIR fluorescence imaging system, prepare 5 small culture flasks for each of the 3 test cell lines (15 flasks in total). Seed 2 x 106 J774A.1, U-118MG and HT-1080 cells per culture flask with 5 ml of the respective culture medium (in quintuples) and grow for 16-24 hr. Parallel to the culture flasks, seed 30,000 cells of each cell line (J774A.1 and HT-1080) or 20,000 cells (U-118MG) to 2 wells of the chamber slide respectively and grow in 500 µl culture medium for 16-24 hr.",
    "On the next day, add 100 nmol (final lipid amount) of Lip-Q to 2 flasks per cell line and to one well of each cell line on the chamber slide. Immediately transfer 1 flask per cell line to 4 °C and the second flask back to the incubator.\n\t\tNOTE: The volume of the probes added to the flasks and the chamber slides are the same, making the concentration on chamber slides 10-fold higher (5 ml is to 500 µl culture medium). This is necessary because microscopic detection is less sensitive than the NIR fluorescence imaging system where cell pellets from the flasks are imaged.\nAdd the free DY-676-COOH at a concentration equivalent to the dye content of Lip-Q to the cells in 2 flasks per cell line and to one well of each cell line on the chamber slide, then immediately transfer 1 flask per cell line to 4 °C (energy depletion) and the other flask together with the chamber slide back to the incubator. Incubate all the cells for 24 hr at the corresponding conditions. The cells in the flask without probe serve as untreated control.\nNIRF imaging and semi-quantitative analysis\n\t\nAfter 24 hr incubation duration, harvest the cells in flasks by washing cells 2 times with Hanks buffered salt solution (HBSS) then scrape cells in 500 µl HBSS and pellet by centrifugation (5 min at 200 x g) in 500 µl tubes.\nPlace the tubes with the cell pellets (and HBSS) in a NIRF imager and image using filters for excitation (615–665 nm) and emission (cut in >700 nm).",
    "Deduct autofluorescence and evaluate the intensity of target versus autofluorescence according to manufacturer instructions. This will give the semi-quantitative levels of fluorescence intensity as average signal (scaled counts/sec), which represents count levels after scaling for exposure time, camera gain, binning and bit depth, so that the measurements are comparable among each other.\nConfocal microscopic analysis\n\t\nAfter 24 hr incubation, harvest the cells on chamber slides by washing 2 times with 500 µl HBSS.\nFix the cells with 200 µl HBSS containing 3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde for 30 min at RT.\nWhile fixation is going on, dilute the DNA stain, Hoechst-33258 1:50 with mounting solution.\nAfter fixation, wash the cells 2 times with HBSS then separate the chambers from the glass slides. Add 50 µl mounting solution containing the DNA-stain on each spot corresponding to the wells of the chamber slides. Cover the cells with glass coverslips, seal edges with transparent nail polish and air-dry for 10 min at RT (dark).\nImage cells on a suitable fluorescence microscope or confocal microscope. Use the following excitation and emission settings for visualization of the corresponding components: nuclei (Hoechst-33258: excitation 405 nm, emission 420–480 nm). NBD-DOPE (liposomal lipid: excitation 488 nm, emission 530 nm). DY-676-COOH (NIR fluorescent dye: excitation 633–645 nm, emission 650–700 nm).\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure that the fluorescence microscope available is equipped with suitable filters which permit excitation and emission of wavelengths higher than 630 nm.\n3. Liposome-based In Vivo Fluorescence Imaging of Inflammation\nPreparation of animals and materials\n\t\nHouse 8–12 week-old male NMRI mice weighing approximately 36 g under standard conditions with food and water ad libitum.\nSeven days prior to the start of experiments, give all mice a low pheophorbide diet in order to reduce tissue autofluorescence.",
    "Twenty-four hours before the start of each experiment, shave mice at the desired area (e.g., whole back area if imaging of hind leg edema is desired).\nWeigh the animals and calculate the amount of probe to be injected per mouse (Lip-Q and Lip-dQ at 10 µmol (lipid concentration) per kg weight and free DY-676-COOH (equivalent to dye content of Lip-Q used).\nImage the animals in a whole body NIR Fluorescence imager with the same settings used for the cell pellets. This measurement provides autofluorescence of the animals.\nDissolve 10 mg zymosan-A in 1 ml isotonic saline solution and store overnight at 4 °C.\nInduction of inflammation and in vivo NIRF imaging\n\t\nPrepare 3 syringes per mouse containing the following solutions. Fill one syringe with 50 µl zymosan-A solution (10 mg/ml) and the second syringe with 50 µl isotonic saline solution. Fill the third syringe with the probes, whereby Lip-Q and Lip-dQ (10 µmol/kg weight (lipid)) are designated for test animals and free DY-676-COOH (concentration as in Lip-Q) for control animals. Make sure the probes are diluted with sterile HBSS to 150 µl final volume.\nApply eye cream on the eyes of animals to avoid dryness and anesthetize animals with 2% isoflurane till they are deeply asleep and do not react when touched on the paws (this takes about 2 min).\nPlace the mouse on a warm mat (still under anesthesia) and inject the zymosan-A solution subcutaneously on the right hind leg and the saline solution on the left hind leg. Immediately inject the probe intravenously and image the animal thereafter then record time of injection/measurement (as t = 0 hr). Save the resulting images as image cubes and repeat the above steps for all other animals and respective probes.",
    "Image the animals every 2 hr for 10 hr post injection and then at 24 hr post injection, making sure that the stage of the measuring chamber is warm (for example, by placing a warm mat underneath), in order to avoid hypothermia. After each measurement, place the animals in a cage with food and water ad libitum and place the cage in a temperate animal chamber.  Euthanize the animals by first anesthetizing with 2% isoflurane till the animals no longer react to touch, then euthanize with carbon dioxide for 5-10 min, making sure that the animals stop breathing completely and rigor mortis occurs. \nDissect the mice according to standard protocols which can be assessed online (http://www.freebookez.com/mouse-dissection-lab-report/) and image the organs.\nEvaluate the measurement results according to manufacturer’s instructions by first deducting the overall fluorescence of the animals (unmixing) then assigning regions of interest for autofluorescence (left hind leg with saline) and target fluorescence of inflamed area (right hind leg with zymosan-A).\nSubscription Required.
