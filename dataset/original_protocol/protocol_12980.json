    "All procedures involving animals were performed in a facility accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International and licensed by the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore, with approval from an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and in compliance with the National Advisory Committee for Laboratory Animal Research Guidelines on the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes (NACLAR, 2004).\n1. Sample collection\nPerform mouse lung dissections after 3 months and 6 months of exposure of ApoE−/− mice. Collect the tissues 16-24 h after exposure, snap-freeze them in liquid nitrogen, and store at −80 °C before initiating the lipidomics workflow. Ensure the collection of a total of nine samples from each \"omics\" dissection group.\n2. Tissue - pulverization of the samples\nPrepare the magnetic hammer and consumables for tissue grinding. Precool tissue pouches, forceps, capped tissue transfer tubes with caps, a \"V\" plastic spatula, and 2 mL plastic collection tubes on dry ice. Install the corresponding tube holder on a magnetic hammer instrument. Switch on the magnetic hammer and set the impact power to High.\nLoad the sample into a tissue pouch; insert the sample through the top opening of the tissue pouch using precooled forceps if needed. Place the sample at the center of the flexible pouch, away from the edges.\nSeal the tissue pouch by screwing a precooled collection tube onto the top of the tissue pouch.\nSnap-freeze the sample by immersing the flexible pouch into liquid nitrogen for 10 s.\nVent the collection tube; loosen the tube for a 1/4 turn for venting to avoid rupturing the pouch when the magnetic hammer impacts.\nLoad the frozen tissue pouch onto the magnetic hammer.",
    "Apply the magnetic hammer by pressing the activate button to pulverize the sample. If non-pulverized tissue pieces remain in the pouch, snap-freeze the sample in liquid nitrogen again and repeat for a second impact.\nRemove the tissue pouch from the magnetic hammer, keeping the pulverized sample at the bottom. To prevent the sample from melting, snap-freeze it again immediately.\nTransfer the sample to a collection tube. Quickly invert the tube so that the tissue pouch is at the top, and tap the pouch to transfer the tissue particles into the bottom of the collection tube.\n\tNOTE: This step should be done quickly to avoid the melting of the tissue.\nTransfer a 10 mg tissue aliquot into a 2 mL tube for further lipidomic analysis and store the sample at −80 °C until further steps are performed.\n3. Tissue homogenization\nSwitch on the tissue lyser instrument and set the shaking frequency at 30 Hz and the shaking duration at 2 min. Prepare the tissue homogenization buffer solution: 150 mM ammonium bicarbonate in water, with a pH of ~8.2.\nTake out the samples from the storage freezer, place on ice, and add four stainless steel beads into the tubes containing the tissue powder. Add 0.5 mL of 150 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer to each sample.\nPlace the sample tubes into the tissue lyser holders. Counterbalance both holders with the same number of tubes. Fix the holders into the tissue lyser holding arm. Disrupt the tissue.\nPlace the tubes on ice and visually check that no leftover tissue aggregates are present in the tube. If tissue disruption is incomplete (aggregates are seen), repeat the disruption process by performing another treatment cycle. Place the samples on ice.",
    "Create an aliquot 1 of 100 µL of the sample in a 1.5 mL tube dedicated for protein determination. Centrifuge it at 18,200 × g for 5 min at 10 °C.\nDetermine the protein content of aliquot 1 by the Bradford assay (see section 4). Store the samples on ice.\nCreate an aliquot 2 of 20-100 µL of the stock homogenate in a new 2 mL microtube for lipid extraction (see section 5). If samples are not immediately analyzed, keep them on ice until the extraction is performed.\n\tNOTE: The final extraction volume must be defined on the basis of the total protein amount. It must be in the range of 0.015-0.045 mg of protein per total aliquot.\n4. Bradford protein determination assay\nNOTE: Study samples should be randomized before the beginning of the analysis, and the randomization is respected for all steps of sample processing.\nDilute centrifuged aliquot 1 supernatant 2x with ammonium bicarbonate buffer.\n\tNOTE: The dilution factor depends on the concentration of the tissue homogenate. For more concentrated solutions, apply a higher factor so that the determined concentration falls in the dynamic range of the assay.\nPrepare a bovine serum albumin (BSA) standard curve according to Table 1. Vortex the standard tubes. Centrifuge the tubes at 18,200 × g for 15 s at room temperature.\nFrom the standard tubes previously prepared, transfer 6 µL each of the blank and standards to a 96-well flat-bottom plate according to the plate layout shown in Figure 1.\nTransfer the previously prepared samples to the 96-well flat-bottom plate according to the plate layout described in Figure 1.\nAdd 250 µL of the Bradford Reagent to each well by using a multichannel pipette and mix. Incubate for 5 min.\nMeasure the absorbance at a 595 nm wavelength by using a plate reader.",
    "Calculate the protein concentrations in the aliquots based on the standard curve.\n\tNOTE: The dilution factor used at the beginning of the procedure should be considered when calculating the protein concentrations.\n5. BUME extraction\nNOTE: Avoid the use of low-bind plastic tubes for lipidomics extraction, since the strong organic solvents release plasticizers and create a strong background during sample analysis.\nPrepare 1.5 mL tubes with 100 µL of ammonium bicarbonate solution in each tube of the total blank (TB), internal standard blank (ISB), and quality control samples (QC), considering 1 QC sample is placed between each set of 10 samples. Keep all samples on ice.\nAdd 10 µL of pooled human plasma to all QC samples. Spike 10 µL of internal standard solution into all ISB, QC, and study samples (i.e., all samples except TB).\n\tNOTE: For quality control material, use any pooled commercially available K2EDTA plasma. Quantify the lipid concentration in pooled plasma using the mentioned protocol upon receipt and keep these ranges as references for all analyses in which the QC material is used. Use NIST plasma only for more targeted applications or for global method verification, where the accuracy of the assay needs to be addressed.\nAdd 300 µL of −20 °C butanol/methanol mixture (3/1, v/v) to each sample. Shake at 450 × g for 10 min at room temperature on the thermomixer.\nAdd 300 µL of heptane/ethyl acetate mixture (3/1, v/v). Shake at 450 × g for 10 min at room temperature on the thermomixer.\nAdd 300 µL of 1% acetic acid mixture. Shake for 5 min at 450 × g at room temperature on the thermomixer. Centrifuge at 2,800 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Transfer 360 µL of the upper phase to a new 2 mL self-lock tube 2.",
    "NOTE: Liquid-liquid extraction can result in shifting positions of the phase boundary in a sample-dependent manner, which can result in a slight volume discrepancy for the upper phase. Adjust the collection volume for the upper phase if necessary.\nAdd 320 µL of heptane/ethyl acetate (3/1, v/v) to the water phase tube 1. Shake at 450 × g for 5 min at room temperature on the thermomixer. Centrifuge at 2,800 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Transfer 320 µL of the upper phase and combine with the fraction from step 5.11.\n\tNOTE: Adjust the collection volume for the upper phase if necessary.\nAdd 250 µL of heptane/ethyl acetate (3/1, v/v) to the water phase in tube 1. Shake at 450 × g for 5 min at room temperature on the thermomixer. Centrifuge at 2,800 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Transfer 200 µL of the upper phase and combine with the fractions from step 5.11 and step 5.15 in tube 2.\n\tNOTE: Adjust the collection volume for the upper phase if necessary.\nEvaporate to dryness at 35 °C in a vacuum concentrator.\n\tNOTE: Dried samples can be stored at −20 °C until analysis, if required.\nRedissolve in 300 µL of MS mix solution (7.5 mM ammonium acetate in isopropanol/methanol/chloroform, 4:2:1 solution). Vortex each tube for 5 s to ensure that everything is dissolved. Centrifuge at 18,200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nTransfer an aliquot of 50 µL into the microliter plate according to the plate layout in Figure 2 for positive ionization mode analysis (columns 1-6) and dilute with 50 µL of MS mix solution.",
    "Transfer an aliquot of 20 µL into the MTP plate according to the plate layout in Figure 2 for negative ionization mode analysis (columns 7-12) and dilute with 80 µL of MS mix. Wrap the plate with foil and keep at 4 °C before the analysis.\n6. MS analysis\nCalibrate a mass spectrometer (MS) both in positive and negative modes in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions 5 days or less before the analysis.\nInstall the direct infusion nano-source upfront, ensuring that it is properly aligned against the transfer capillary of the MS. Install a 4.1 µm nozzle chip into the chip holder and configure it in the software.\nUse the following parameters for positive and negative mode method setup: gas pressure of 1.25 psi; source voltage of 1.1 kV; 5 µL of sample injection volume; output contact closure Rel1 for 2.5 s; 5 min of delivery time; plate cooling at 4 °C.\nSet up the analysis sequence queue for the direct infusion robot in positive mode.\nSet up the MS method for positive mode using the following MS settings:\n\t\nSet the capillary temperature at 250 °C and the S-lens RF level at 65.0. Perform full-scan MS acquisition from 0 to 1 min in the 550-1000 m/z range at 140,000 resolution with automated gain control of 1 ×106 and maximum injection time of 50 ms. Apply lock mass of 680.48022.",
    "Set data-independent MS/MS acquisition method between the 1 and 5 min time range at 17,500 resolution with a fixed first mass of 250 m/z. Use an automated gain control for MS2 at 1 × 105 and maximum injection time of 64 ms, a collision energy of 20 NCE, and an isolation window of 1 m/z. Use the inclusion mass list from 550 to 1,000 m/z, with a mass step of 1 Da.\nFor the acquisition in negative mode, set the capillary temperature at 250 °C and the S-Lens RF level at 65.0 in the MS tune file.\n\t\nUse the following MS method settings: full-scan acquisition mode from 0 to 1 min at 140,000 resolution covering the 400-940 m/z range, automated gain control of 1 × 106; maximum injection time of 50 ms; use a lock mass of 529.46262.\nSet MS2 acquisition in DIA mode between 1 and 5 min of the run at a resolution of 17,500 with a fixed first mass of 150 m/z; automated gain control of 1 × 105; 64 ms of maximum injection time; and 35NCE of collision energy. Use the inclusion mass list from 400 to 940 with a mass step of 1 Da.\nCreate the analysis sequence queue in MS software in positive mode. Wait for the sample acquisition to be triggered by a contact closure signal coming from the direct infusion robot for each sample.\nWhen positive mode analysis is complete, create the sequence queue for the direct infusion robot in negative mode.\nSet up the analysis sequence queue in MS software in negative mode.\n7. Data processing\nTo convert the data files from the positive and negative modes from .raw format to .mzML format, use the converter software.",
    "NOTE: Data files from positive and negative modes must be converted separately (because of their different acquisition settings and different noise threshold).\n\t\nFill the following settings to perform file conversion: noise threshold factor is 3 and 5 for MS and MS2, respectively; activate the noise removal function for both MS and MS2, data compression, average MS2 scans, and peak picking. Set TIC thresholds for positive and negative modes (e.g., 10,000 and 5,000; to be defined based on the noise level of the particular sample produced by a specific instrument). Generate XLC and PDF reports at the end of the processing.\nPerform the lipid identification. Define the following (example) file import settings parameters: selection window ±0.5 Da (depends on the selection window in the MS method); time range 2-300 s (depends on scan time in the MS method); no calibration masses for MS and MS2; transfer and round up the mass range from the Peak by Peak software metadata files (min mass [MS]) and (min mass [MS2]); tolerance of 3 ppm and 10 ppm for MS and MS2, respectively; keep empty the MS and MS2 threshold field, frequency filter, MS1 offset and PMO; Isotopic correction for MS and MS2 selected; transfer resolution gradient from the converter metadata file as (Resolution linear fit [MS]) and as (Resolution linear fit [MS2]).\n\tNOTE: Lipid identification in the positive and negative modes must be performed separately because of their different acquisition settings.\nAfter the data are imported, go to the Run menu and upload the MFQL files for lipid identification.\n\tNOTE: For detailed information on the structure of MFQLs, refer to the publication by Herzog et al.25. See some examples of MFQL files at https://wiki.mpi-cbg.de/lipidx/MFQL_library and see the discussion. All MFQLs used for the data processing are provided in the Supplementary Materials.",
    "Quantify the identified species on the MS level by dividing the precursor mass intensity of the lipid feature by the respective intensity of the labeled internal standard and then multiplying the quotient by the concentration of the labeled internal standard. Normalize the final lipid concentration per amount of total protein measured by the Bradford assay.\n8. QC check procedure\nNOTE: A quality check procedure is an essential step to verify the technical reproducibility of the method. To this end, a commercial pooled plasma is analyzed to determine the endogenous levels of different lipids over 5 days in 15 identical aliquots per batch (total of five batches). Note that, in this case, a data evaluation pipeline was created as a Shiny web application using the R statistical software environment.\nDefine the reference acceptance range as the average value calculated for all five batches ±3 standard deviations.\nApply the \"pass\" acceptance rules for each analytical batch: 90% of the reference targets must pass, considering that one reference compound represents one lipid class. For example, if 15 reference targets are included in the QC verification, ensure that 13 targets pass for the batch to be accepted.\n\tNOTE: In other words, 68% of QC samples per reference compound must pass for the data for this lipid class to be accepted.\nIf the study batch does not meet the acceptance criteria for the QC check, repeat the procedure.\n9. Estimation of (relative) conjugated fatty acid amounts\nFor each lipid class, estimate the amounts of conjugated fatty acids based on their MS2 intensities.",
    "NOTE: Due to fragmentation and ionization differences, the derived values were only meant for relative abundance comparisons across sample groups rather than, for example, to estimate the relative contribution of a specific fatty acid to the overall conjugated fatty acid pool of a lipid class.\nNormalize the MS2 intensities of the fatty acid fragments by the average intensity of the fatty acid fragments of the corresponding internal standard. Based on the concentration of the internal standard and the measured tissue weight, derive a \"normalized concentration\" for the conjugated fatty acids. Sum up these values per lipid class to estimate the total amount of each conjugated fatty acid per sample.\n10. Statistical analysis\nPerform statistical analysis. Fit a linear model for each condition and the corresponding control group, and calculate p values from a t-statistic for log2-transformed data. Use the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate method to correct for multiple testing effects.\n\tNOTE: Lipids with adjusted p values < 0.05 are considered differentially abundant. Here, statistical analysis was performed in the R statistical environment26."
