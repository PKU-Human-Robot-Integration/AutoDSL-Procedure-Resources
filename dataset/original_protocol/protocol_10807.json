    "All of the procedures below are carried out using aseptic techniques inside a Class II Biosafety Cabinet. Reagents and equipments used are listed in the tables below.\n1. Preparation of 1.1% Alginate (w/v)\nAdd 0.275 g of purified sodium alginate (high glucuronic acid content ≥60%, viscosity >200 mPa s, and endotoxin ≤100 EU/g) in a sterile 50 ml tube and add 25 ml sterile 0.1% gelatin solution prepared earlier (0.5g gelatin/500 ml milli-Q H2O and dissolved by autoclaving).\nVortex the tube for approximately 30 seconds to partially dissolve the alginate powder then place the tube on an orbital mixer at 10 x g for overnight (room temperature).\nAdd 2.778 ml of 9% sterile NaCl (4.5 g of NaCl/50 ml milli-Q H2O) to 25 ml of alginate solution. Vortex the tube for approximately 30 seconds followed by centrifugation at 95 x g for 5 min.\nStore the alginate solution at 4 °C for short-term storage (1-2 months) or at -20 °C for long-term storage (about a year).\n2. Preparation of CaCl2 Precipitation Bath\nDissolve 14.7 g of CaCl2.2H2O and 2.38 g of HEPES in 1 litre of milli-Q H2O.\nAdjust the pH level to 7.4.\nSterilize the solution using a 0.22 μm filter.\nPrecipitation bath can be stored at room temperature (6-12 months).\n3. Preparation of Decapsulating Solution\nIn 500 ml of Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline (D-PBS), add 50 ml of 0.5M EDTA and 5 ml of 1M HEPES.\nSterilize using a 0.22 μm filter or autoclave at 121 °C for 20 min.\nStore the decapsulating solution at room temperature (6-12 months).\n4. Preparation of Serum Replacement (SR) Medium\nPrior to encapsulation, prepare SR medium in advance as described in Table of specific reagents and equipment.\n5. Preparation of ROCK Inhibitor (Y-27632)",
    "Dilute Y-27632 powder in 0.1% human serum albumin (HSA) in D-PBS to make a 5 mM solution.\n6. Preparation of hESC for Encapsulation\nPre-treat the cells with culturing media supplemented with 10 μM of ROCK inhibitor (RI) for two hours at 37 °C (protect from light).\nAfter the RI treatment, wash cells with D-PBS twice and dislodge the cells from culture plates enzymatically with accutase for 10 min at 37 °C.\nGently scrape the cells with the pipette or cell scraper and collect in a 15 ml tube. Neutralize the accutase with SR medium in 1:1 ratio.\nTo prepare a single cell suspension, filter the neutralized cells using a 40 μm filter and collect in a fresh 50 ml centrifuge tube.\nCalculate the total number of cells in the solution using a hemacytometer.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension 95 x g for 5 min and carefully discard the supernatant afterwards. Wash the cells with pre-warmed 0.9% NaCl. Centrifuge 95 x g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.\n7. Encapsulation of Cells\nPrepare a 1 ml syringe attached to a soft plastic tubing of 14G x 2\" I.V. catheter. This is used to aspirate the cell suspension to be loaded on to the syringe pump as shown in Figure 1.\nResuspend the cells with pre-warmed alginate solution at a density of 1.25 million cells/ml alginate. Gently mix with the syringe and avoid creating bubbles.\nSet up the bead generator, syringe pump and the air flow meter as shown in Figure 1. More details of these devices are listed in Table of specific reagents and equipment.",
    "With the cells aspirated into the syringe, discard the plastic tubing of I.V. catheter and attach the syringe to the encapsulation machine. Ensure that there is a 10 cm gap between the end of the encapsulation machine and the collection point as shown in Figure 1.\nEncapsulate the cells by setting the syringe pump at 20 ml/hr, air flow rate at 8 L/min and a pressure of 100 kPa (the size of capsules can be changed by altering the air flow rate).\nCollect the encapsulated cells into a petri dish (100 x 15 mm) filled with 20 ml of pre-warmed precipitation bath for 7 min to stabilize the capsules.\nTransfer the encapsulated cells by gentle aspiration into 50 ml centrifuge tubes filled with 20 ml of 0.9% NaCl.\nAllow the capsules to settle into the bottom of the tube then gently discard the supernatant. Repeat the washing process with 0.9% NaCl.\nResuspend the encapsulated cells in pre-warmed culturing medium supplemented with RI (10 μM), transfer into a culture flask and incubated at 37 °C/5% CO2.\n8. Differentiation of Encapsulated hESC to DA Neurons\nThe encapsulated hESC are treated with RI for 3 days prior to differentiation.\nSeed the mouse stromal cell line, PA6 cells at a density of 1.0 x 104 per cm2 in 0.1% gelatin-coated T75 flask and condition the PA6 cells in DA neural differentiation medium (Materials Table) 24 hours before the differentiation.\nTransfer the capsules to a 50 ml centrifuge tube and allow them to settle into the bottom of the tube.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the capsules in PA6 cell-conditioned DA neural differentiation medium.",
    "Culture the encapsulated hESC with the PA6 cell monolayer ( 9 x 106 hESCs per 7.5 x 105 PA6 cells ) for 28 days with a media change on day 4 and every other day thereafter (change only half of the medium each time).\nAfter 3 weeks in culture with PA6 cells, supplement the DA neural differentiation medium with 100 ng/ml SHH and 100 ng/ml FGF8a for the remaining week.\n9. Decapsulation of Encapsulated hESC\nAspirate the capsules into a 15 ml centrifuge tube and allow them to settle at the bottom of the tube. Then discard the supernatant carefully.\nWash the capsules with D-PBS twice. Let the capsules settle at the bottom of the tube then remove the supernatant.\nAdd 5 ml decapsulating solution to the capsules. Mix the suspension thoroughly via aspiration prior to incubation at room temperature for 4-5 min.\nCentrifuge the decapsulated cells at 95 x g for 3 min and discard the supernatant.\nWash the cell pellet with D-PBS followed by centrifugation at 95 x g for 3 min. Repeat.\nThe decapsulated cells can be further cultured as a monolayer or used for downstream analysis.\n10. Representative Results",
    "The diameter of alginate microcapsules is 400-500 μm. The number of cells within the capsule was estimated by calculating the total number of cells divided by total number of capsules per run. Therefore, approximately 5.0 x 104 cells per capsule was estimated. From this, we presume that the maximum number of cells the capsule can contain is approximately 1.0 x 105. The viability of encapsulated hESC is >80% (Figure 2) as determined by using using carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidly ester (CFDA)/propidium iodide (PI) assay. We have optimized the conditions of hESC encapsulation by decreasing the alginate concentration from 2.2% down to 1.1% and by changing the precipitation bath from barium chloride to calcium chloride. From these conditions, we showed that only the cells which were encapsulated with 1.1% calcium alginate could survive, proliferate and form EBs in vitro1. To further optimize the condition, the effects of culturing media and RI, Y-27632 were investigated. The data as presented in Figure 2 and 3 demonstrate that RI prevented dissociation-induced apoptosis and maintained cell viability and promoted cluster formation1,6. Furthermore, the viability of encapsulated hESC cultured in hFF-CM + RI was significantly higher than other groups without RI supplementation; however this was not significantly different to encapsulated hESC cultured in SR + RI. Similarly, cell proliferation using BrdU assay increased from 25% to 75% as single cells developed into clusters (Figure 3). Apoptosis assay by TUNEL revealed that the single cells in microcapsules cultured in SR medium were apoptotic (data not shown) whereas the retrieved clusters from the hFF-CM were mostly negative for TUNEL. To a certain extent, hFF-CM supplemented with bFGF also promoted the survival and proliferation of encapsulated hESCs in the absence of Y-27632.",
    "However, treatment with Y-27632 before (2 hours) and after encapsulation (for an additional 4 days) markedly enhanced viability, proliferation and cluster formation of encapsulated hESC in 1.1% calcium alginate microcapsules.",
    "Previously we demonstrated that encapsulated hESC can be successfully differentiated to definitive endoderm1. Here, we examined the application of cell encapsulation as a 3D platform to differentiate encapsulated hESC into DA neurons. hESC, that formed embryoid bodies (EB) in capsules were direct differentiated and on decapsulation under the conditions described showed a progressive neuronal morphology (Figure 4) after 2-3 days of culture with more than 90% viability. Gene expression analysis showed a down-regulation of pluripotent marker, OCT4 while neuroprogenitor marker, PAX6 and DA neuronal marker, TH were up-regulated after 7 days of differentiation (Figure 5A). Immunofluorescent staining revealed that differentiated hESC were PAX6-positive (>80%) but OCT4-negative at day 7. Further differentiated hESC showed TH-positive (>90%) neurons after 21 days (Figure 5B). Western blot analysis also showed an up-regulation of TH expression from day 14 (Figure 5C) while PAX6 expression was down-regulated after day 21. In comparison, the cells cultured under two-dimensional (2D) environment under similar conditions (e.g. RI pre-treatment for 2 hours and RI post-treatment for 3 days prior to differentiation) maintained a high percentage of PAX6-positive cells (>80%) throughout the differentiation period and were not as efficient in differentiating to TH-positive cells (<60%) as in 3D environment provided by encapsulation (Figure 5A and C).Subscription Required.
