    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSlide assembly\nTiming: ∼1 h\nThe single-molecule slide is assembled by attaching the coverslip and slide with double sided tape and sealed two edges with epoxy. For flow experiments, epoxy molds and buffer reservoirs are added for automated flow of solutions. The walkthrough of slide assembly is shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nNote: Take out the stored slides tube from −20°C freezer and equilibrate them at ∼25°C for ∼15–20 min.\nMake microfluidic channel\nTear off ∼5–7 cm long piece of double-sided tape (from Scotch brand of 0.1 mm thickness) and paste on a clean glass surface. Slice the tape into ∼1 mm-wide strips using a clean razor blade.\nCarefully take out the slide from the tube and place the PEGylated side face-up on a clean surface.\nTake out the coverslip and place the PEGylated side face-up onto the top of the tip box.\nLift the tape strip (from step a) using the razor blade and gently apply it in-between each hole to the PEGylated slide surface.\nPlace the coverslip on the taped slide. The PEGylated side of the slide and coverslip should be facing each other.\nGently press the coverslip with a 200-μL pipet tip (or 1000- μL pipet tip and/or the blunt edge of a razor blade) to properly seal the tape.\nThe edges of the slide-coverslip sandwich are sealed by applying quick-drying epoxy with a 10-μL pipet tip.\nNote: Excessive epoxy can block the holes by flowing in via capillary action.\nWait ∼5–10 min for complete drying of the epoxy.\nMake the reservoir for real-time flow experiments\nCut the upper part of 200 μL pipet tips into small pieces that can be used for buffer reservoir.",
    "Using epoxy, the buffer reservoir is attached around each of the drilled holes at the top of the slide.\nInsert 10 μL pipet tips into the other drilled holes and seal with epoxy to create a mold for the syringe attachment.\nWait ∼15–20 min until the epoxy has completely dried.\nCarefully remove the 10 μL pipet tips.\nCut the 10 μL pipet tip and use the lower part to attach 2 mm tube inside the cut tip using epoxy.\nAttach the tube to a 1 mL syringe with a needle Luer-lock.\nInstrument calibration\nTiming: ∼30 min\nThe TIRF instrument should be calibrated before doing real-time single-molecule measurements.\nPrepare the standard bead slide\nDissolve 1 μL tetraspeck standard fluorescent beads in 99 μL T50 buffer.\nVortex for 1 min three times.\nPipet 50 μL of diluted low-density bead solution onto the premade flow chamber of a non-PEGylated quartz/glass slide.\nWait for 3–5 min and then wash with T50 buffer containing 0.1 N HCl and ∼5% glycerol.\nNote: To adjust the molecular density, observe the bead slide using the TIRF microscope before sealing the slide. If there are too few beads, an additional bead solution can be added. If there are too many beads, discard the channel and apply a more dilute solution to another channel. The optimum number of beads is ∼300–400 spots per imaging area of 2,500 μm2.\nSeal the channel with fast-drying epoxy and ensure that there are no air bubbles inside.\nAllow the epoxy to solidify for ∼10 min. Transfer to a 50 mL conical vial for safekeeping and store at 4°C for further use.\nMap the donor/acceptor channel using a standard bead slide (instrument calibration).\nCarefully apply one drop (∼80 μL) of Milli-Q water to the objective on the TIRF microscope.",
    "Gently place the slide on the microscope; the coverslip should be facing down toward the objective.\nProperly clean the prism with ethanol using soft Kimwipes or lens cleaning tissue. Add ∼1 drop of immersion oil and fix the prism to the microscope so that the oil surface is touching the slide.\nTurn on the fluorescent laser to illuminate the beads. Adjust the microscopic stage as needed to properly focus on the fluorescent beads.\nOptimize the data scaler, background, gain, exposure time, and laser intensity as needed.\nRecord ∼2 s short movies and follow the quantification steps below for mapping. The mapping efficiency should be at least ∼85%. (see quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis] for further instructions).\nMethod 1: 0.1% SDS to efficiently remove the DNA- or RNA-bound protein\nTiming: ∼ 1–2 h\nThis step uses FRET-labeled DNA or RNA constructs, which can be tethered on a PEGylated slide via biotin-NeutrAvidin linkage. The tagged or untagged protein-of-interest can be flown onto the slide for experiments. This protocol uses 0.1% SDS, which is highly effective for repeatedly regenerating the single-molecule surface by removing all the DNA or RNA-bound protein. This process restores the clean, unbound substrate tethered to the surface.\nRegeneration of surface-tethered DNA or RNA-bound protein.\nPut the assembled slide (from step 1, Slide Assembly) on the TIRF microscope (follow step 4, Instrument Calibration). (Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1])\nFlow 50 μL NeutrAvidin (100 μg/mL) in either T50 or experimental buffer into the sample chamber of the slide.\nIncubate for ∼1–2 min.\nWash the sample chamber with 50 μL T50 or experimental buffer.\nFlow 50 μL of 20 pM biotinylated and FRET-labeled DNA or RNA construct.\nIncubate for ∼1–2 min.\nWash the sample chamber with 50 μL experimental buffer.\nFlow 50 μL imaging buffer.",
    "Turn on the laser for movie recording. The microscope stage needs to be adjusted for proper focusing of the single-molecule surface.\nNote: The DNA or RNA density on the single-molecule surface should be approximately 300–400 molecules per field of view. (Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3])\nRecord 20 short movies (2 s) at different imaging areas with the donor excitation laser on for making the FRET histogram. A shutter manager can be used to alternatively excite the donor and acceptor dyes.\nRecord 3–4 long movies (120 s) at different imaging areas with the donor excitation laser to record the individual molecular behavior.\nFlow 50 μL of imaging buffer with your protein-of-interest at the desired concentration.\nNote: If the flow assembly setup with the reservoir is being used, acquire a long video (180 s) while flowing the protein at the 10 s mark into the sample chamber with the syringe pump.\nNote: For all single-molecule flow measurements using the syringe pump, it is highly recommended that less volume is withdrawn than is added to the buffer reservoir. For instance, if 50 μL of the solution is added to the reservoir, 40 μL should be withdrawn by the pump to make sure that the slide chamber is not empty. A slower flow rate of ∼1 mL/min is recommended.\nFollow steps 5j-k again to record the protein-bound movies before and after buffer wash (to remove free protein).\nNote: Depending on the experimental condition, more movies can be recorded after protein incubation.\nNote: Make sure no air bubbles pass through the channel while washing off the free protein.\nFlow 50 μL of 0.1% SDS in T50 or experimental buffer.",
    "Critical: Maintain the salt concentration during SDS wash to stabilize the DNA or RNA. T50 or 100 mM NaCl or 1–5 mM MgCl2 salt-containing buffer is recommended during SDS wash. Avoid KCl during the SDS wash because it precipitates to SDS-potassium complex, which reduces the SDS effect in denaturing the protein.\nNote: Use freshly prepared SDS. Old SDS stock reduces the effectiveness of regeneration.\nIncubate for ∼1 min.\nWash 2–3 times with 50 μL T50 or experimental buffer.\nFlow 50 μL imaging buffer.\nFollow steps 5i-m. This is the first round of regeneration.\nFollow steps 5n-q and then steps 5i-m for the second round of regeneration.\nContinue it for multiple rounds of regeneration (efficiently regenerate at least for 10 times).\nThe recorded movies are processed and analyzed as described below (see quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis]).\nNote: Other protein denaturants may be used during regeneration (e.g., 6 M Urea, 6 M GdmCl or 100 μM Proteinase-K), but the regeneration efficiency of 0.1% SDS is much higher compared to all others.\nMethod 2: Duplex substrate regeneration\nTiming: ∼1 h and more",
    "This method details two different strategies to regenerate the duplex DNA or RNA substrate. First, we describe helicase-induced duplex substrate regeneration, which requires a helicase that unwinds the DNA or RNA substrate; the FRET-labeled DNA or RNA construct is dissociated by a helicase treatment, leaving the biotinylated strand on the surface for annealing to a new DNA or RNA strand. (Paul et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). This unwinding leads to the loss of FRET pair, which can be visualized by laser excitation. Alternatively, one can use 50 mM NaOH, which also dissociates the duplexed RNA or DNA. Again, the biotinylated single-stranded DNA or RNA remains bound to the surface while the non-biotinylated strand is washed away. In both cases, the complementary ssDNA or ssRNA is flowed to regenerate a new RNA or DNA duplex.\nNote: Using this regeneration process, one duplex can be exchanged with another if the applied ssDNA or ssRNA is complementary to the surface-tethered ssDNA or ssRNA.\nHelicase-induced duplex substrate regeneration (any DNA or RNA unwinding helicase).\nFollow steps 5a-k to immobilize the DNA or RNA construct for helicase experiments.\nFlow 50 μL imaging buffer with your helicase-of-interest at the desired concentration and conditions.\nRecord the movies until the unwinding process is completed.\nNote: Helicase-induced duplex unwinding leaves behind the biotinylated single-strand DNA or RNA.\nFlow 50 μL of 5 nM complementary ssDNA with 5 mM MgCl2 containing buffer. (Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5])\nIncubate for ∼5 min.\nWash 2–3 times with 50 μL of experimental buffer.\nFlow 50 μL imaging buffer and record movies.\nRepeat the unwinding process by following steps 6b-c.\nContinue regenerating the process if desired by following steps 6b-h.\nNaOH-induced duplex substrate regeneration\nFollow steps from 5a-k to immobilize the DNA or RNA and record movies.\nFlow 50 μL of 50 mM NaOH.\nIncubate for ∼1 min.",
    "Wash 2–3 times with 50 μL T50 or experimental buffer.\nNote: NaOH denatures the surface-bound duplex and leaves behind the biotinylated, surface-tethered single-strand DNA or RNA.\nFlow 50 μL of 5 nM complementary ssDNA with 5 mM MgCl2 containing buffer. (Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5])\nIncubate for ∼5 min.\nWash 2–3 times with 50 μL buffer.\nFlow 50 μL imaging buffer and record movies.\nIf desired, repeat the regeneration and data acquisition protocol from 7b-h.\nMethod 3: Breaking the biotin-streptavidin/NeutrAvidin linkage\nTiming: ∼2 h\nThis method describes the breakage of the biotin-NeutrAvidin linkage using 7 M NaOH. The PEG-biotin is revealed by stripping the NeutrAvidin layer. Therefore, this protocol regenerates the PEG-biotin surface, which can then be reused for entirely different experiments.\n7 M NaOH (Caution: strong base) breaks the biotin-NeutrAvidin linkage.\nFollow steps from 5a-k to immobilize the DNA or RNA construct and record movies.\nFlow 50 μL of 7 M NaOH.\nIncubate for ∼2–3 min.\nWash 2–3 times with 50 μL T50 or experimental buffer.\nFollow steps from 5b-t for DNA or RNA immobilization and continue regeneration using 0.1% SDS, if desired.\nThe sample can be changed by repeating the regeneration process. Follow steps 8b-e as needed. (Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7])\nMethod 4: Antibody regeneration\nTiming: ∼2 h\nThis method describes the single-molecule pull-down experiments where 0.1% SDS is used to regenerate the surface bound antibody. Generally, in pull-down assay, biotinylated antibodies against the protein-of-interest are immobilized on a passivated microscope slide. The surface-tethered antibody captures the partner protein through physiological interaction (Jain et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Then, applied non-biotinylated fluorophore label DNA/RNA interact with immobilized protein and the fluorescence signal is detected through TIRF microscopy.\nRegeneration of antibody using 0.1% SDS.\nFollow steps from 5a-d.\nFlow 50 μL of 10 nM biotin conjugated antibody either in T50 or experimental buffer.",
    "Note: In pull down experiments, the exact antibody used is dependent on the tag attached on the corresponding protein-of-interest. For instance, biotinylated anti-GFP antibodies (Rockland Antibodies & Assays, Cat#600406215) are used for GFP-tagged protein, and anti-His antibodies (Qiagen, Cat#34660) are used for His-tagged proteins. The antibody dilution (∼10 nM) needs to be optimized for each protein-antibody pair (generally in the range of 100× to 2000× dilution). (Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9])\nIncubate for 3–5 min.\nWash with 50 μL T50 or experimental buffer.\nFlow 50 μL 10 nM tagged protein (corresponding to the surface-tethered antibody) in T50 or experimental buffer.\nIncubate for ∼10 min.\nWash with 50 μL T50 or experimental buffer.\nNote: Make sure no air bubbles pass through the channel during the entire pull-down experiment.\nFlow 50 μL of 10 nM non-biotinylated DNA or RNA construct that can bind with surface-tethered protein. (Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5])\nIncubate for ∼10 min.\nWash with 50 μL of T50 or experimental buffer.\nFlow 50 μL of imaging buffer.\nTurn on the excitation laser for recording movies. The microscope stage needs to be adjusted for proper focusing of the single-molecule surface.\nNote: The DNA or RNA density on the single-molecule surface needs to be optimized approximately 300–400 molecules per field of view.\nRecord 20 short movies (2 s) at different imaging areas with the donor excitation laser for making the FRET histogram, if applicable. A shutter manager can be used to excite the donor and acceptor dyes.\nRecord 3–4 long movies (120 s) at different imaging areas with the donor excitation laser to visualize individual molecules.\nFlow 50 μL of 0.1% SDS with T50 or experimental buffer.\nIncubate for ∼1 min.\nWash 2–3 times with 50 μL of T50 or experimental buffer.\nFollow steps 9h-n to perform additional experimental conditions. This is one round of regeneration.",
    "Note: Treatment with 0.1% SDS is usually not harsh enough to disrupt the antibody interactions of surface-bound protein, but it is sufficient to release the bound DNA or RNA. If 0.1% SDS is sufficient to disrupt the antibody-protein interaction, repeat steps 9e-n to flow the protein-of-interest again.\nFollow steps 9o-r for another round of regeneration and repeat for multiple rounds of regeneration as needed.\nNote: Use the 7M NaOH treatment to change one biotinylated antibody to another biotinylated antibody following the steps described in Method 3."
