    "The study is a randomized trial, where half of the research participants (stratified by cognitive status) are randomized 1 to 1 to receive computerized cognitive training (CCT) on the Double-Decision task from the Posit Science Brain HQ training software combined with the CFST and the others are trained on the CFST alone. This research was reviewed and approved by the University of Miami Institutional Review Board and all participants provided signed informed consent.\n1. Preparation\nObtain written informed consent.\nScreen the participant with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA)11.\n\t\nHave the participant connect numbers and letters in sequence.\nShow the participant 3 pictures of animals and have them name them.\nRead 3 verbal learning words and have participant recall them.\nPerform a baseline cognitive assessment using the tablet version of the Brief Assessment of Cognition (Figure 1)12. Administer all of the subtests on the tablet app. The subtests are Verbal Learning and Memory, Digit Sequencing, Token Motor Task, Symbol Coding, Verbal Fluency Examinations, and Tower of London.\n\t\nPresent the overall instructions for the assessment on the app.\nPresent the instructions for the Symbol Coding Task.\nHave the participant do practice coding.\nWatch the participant perform the coding task for 15 seconds.\nPresent the instructions for the Tower of London Task.\nHave the participant do the practice items.\nWatch the participant solve the first test item.\nAssess the participant with 6 different functional tasks (Figure 2) in a fixed difficulty format.\n\tNOTE: During the fixed difficulty assessment, there is no training provided, and if a participant makes an error, the instructions are simply repeated. When a participant completes a task, they proceed to the next one. When all of the tasks are completed, training begins. The representative task demands of each task are presented below.",
    "2. Task demands for fixed difficulty and training simulations\nLaunch the Ticket Purchase Task.\n\t\nSelect purchase a new ticket.\nSelect Purchase a single ride ticket.\nCheck the balance on the transit card.\nAdd $60.00 to the transit card.\nLaunch the telephone refill task.\n\t\nDial the number for the pharmacy.\nEnter the prescription number.\nSelect the time to pick up the medication.\nLaunch the ATM banking task.\n\t\nEnter the PIN to start the session.\nCheck the balance in the checking account.\nWithdraw $180.00 from the checking account.\nLaunch the medication label comprehension task.\n\t\nChoose the correct time of day to take the medication.\nCorrectly identify how many pills to take each day.\nLaunch the medication organizer subtask.\nPack up a day's worth of medications.\nLaunch the internet banking task.\n\t\nEnter the User ID and password.\nCheck the balance in the checking account.\nMake a transfer of $15.00 from savings to checking.\nLaunch the internet prescription refill and online shopping task.\n\t\nEnter the userID and password.\nVerify your identity by selecting the correct city (Miami), Street (Micapony) and Car color (Blue).\nSelect Prinivil and no generic equivalent.\nSelect Correct date and time for pickup.\n3. Training after the fixed difficulty assessment\nCFST alone condition\n\t\nExplain the training task to the participant, stating that all 6 tasks will be trained.\nLaunch the ATM banking task.\nEnter PIN.\nSelect transaction (check balance in checking).\nVisualize the process of program-delivered feedback for errors.\nPresent 4 errors in sequence to demonstrate the feedback process.\nCCT + CFST Condition\n\tNOTE: The CFST training is the same as CFST alone but is for 30 minutes only. Brain HQ DoubleDecision is the computerized cognitive training task in the combined condition. Figure 3 depicts the Double-Decision Task.",
    "Explain the process of Training on Computerized cognitive training as well as skills training.\nLaunch Brain HQ double Decision Task.\nPerform the practice items.\nPerform the actual test items.\nVisualize this process for about 30 seconds.\n4. Post-training assessment\nNOTE: After graduation from all six training tasks or completion of 24 sessions, participants complete a post-test. This next section should be presented as a verbal description of the post training assessments\nHave participants perform different versions of all six trained tasks. They will be told that the tasks are the same, but the content demands are different.\nHave participants perform the BAC App assessment again."
