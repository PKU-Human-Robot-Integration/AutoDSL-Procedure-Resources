  "procedures": [
    "All procedures were conducted in compliance with the National Research Council's Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (eighth edition; 2011) and the Canadian Council on Animal Care's Guide to the Care and Use of Experimental Animals (1993), and were approved by the University of Western Ontario Animal Use Subcommittee of the University Council on Animal Care.\nThe following procedure can be applied to experiments studying cortical contributions to locomotor control in the walking cat.\n1. Apparatus\nConstruct the apparatus used to assess obstacle memory.\n\tNOTE: The apparatus consists of a 2.43 m long, 29 cm wide walkway enclosed by 18 cm high clear acrylic walls (Figure 1). A narrow slot halfway along the apparatus allows a 25.8 cm wide x 3 mm thick obstacle to be raised onto or removed from the walkway using a lever mounted underneath the walking surface.\nTo ensure that attention of the animal is maintained on eating, avoid using the hand to raise or lower the obstacle. Instead, the obstacle can be raised or lowered using the experimenter's leg to move the lever underneath the walkway, allowing the experimenter to continue feeding the animal.\nProperly maintain the lever system to ensure that the obstacle can be raised or lowered soundlessly.\nUse a small elevated platform (23 cm long x 23 cm wide x 16 cm high) upon which soft food is placed, to guide movements of the animal.\nRecord all trials using an ethernet camera (54 frames/s) mounted on a tripod 1.85 m away from the midline of the walkway.\n2. Training Procedures",
    "NOTE:  For successful data acquisition, a period of training preceding behavioral testing ensures that each animal is properly acclimated to the testing room and apparatus. Repeated exposure to a novel environment will aid in reducing startling or other stressful behaviors.  Acclimation may vary between animals and may require 1-2 months of training. Initial acclimation sessions may be up to 5 min in length depending on the focus and motivation of the animal to eat. Subsequent sessions should aim to increase the duration of time that the animal is motivated to work (typically around 20-25 min).\nAcquire mature ( >6 months of age) domestic short hair cats from a commercial laboratory breeder of any weight or sex.\n\tNOTE: Motivation to work for food and a cooperative disposition comprise the selection criteria when considering which animals should be included in the study.\nAcclimate each animal to wearing a harness to which a 1 m long leash is attached. Anchor the leash to a shelf above the walkway over the midpoint of the walkway.\n\tNOTE: This allows the animal to walk along the central portion of the apparatus without any tension, thus encouraging the animal to remain within this portion of the apparatus. Establishing such boundaries is helpful for working with a moving test subject.\nPlace the animal onto the walkway, allowing it to eat from the platform upon which soft food is placed.\n\tNOTE: One aim of this initial training is to ensure that the animal readily follows the food platform when moved forwards, and can walk comfortably with the harness and leash. The use of soft food as positive reinforcement encourages the animal to remain focused throughout each training or testing session, and promotes a comfortable working environment.",
    "Ensure that the animal is comfortable with handling, including instances where the animal must be moved to the start area of the walkway.\n3. Behavioral Training and Testing Protocol\nNOTE: The obstacle memory is assessed in two paradigms: a visually-dependent obstacle memory task, and a tactile-dependent obstacle memory task. Both paradigms should be used during initial training and subsequent testing.\nVisual obstacle memory\nTo assess the visual obstacle memory, raise the obstacle onto the walkway (Figure 2A). Place the platform on the far side of the obstacle. Place the animal in the start area of the walkway.\nAllow the animal to approach the food, stepping over the obstacle with only its forelegs in order to eat from the platform.\nAs the animal continues to eat, lower the obstacle such that it becomes flush with the walkway to prevent any further visual or tactile inputs.\nFollowing a variable delay period, move the food forwards again to encourage the animal to resume walking; this delay can be less than 1 s to upwards of 2 min.\nImportantly, perform trials where the obstacle is absent in order to prevent habituation to the obstacle and development of a learned avoidance response. In such visual obstacle-absent trials, ensure that the obstacle is not raised onto the walkway before placing the animal in the start area of the walkway.\nObserve hindleg stepping in obstacle-present and obstacle-absent trials to verify typical locomotor behaviors and intact visual obstacle memory prior to cooling. Ensure that the animal can clear the obstacle without contact, and that stepping of all four legs is significantly elevated in obstacle-present trials.\n\t\tNOTE: Watching videos of training trials may assist in this verification.\nTactile obstacle memory",
    "To assess the tactile obstacle memory, ensure that the obstacle is not raised onto the walkway before placing the animal in the start area of the walkway (Figure 2B).\nAllow the animal to walk towards the food platform placed on the far side of the obstacle slot.\nAs the animal eats, raise the obstacle onto the walkway beneath the food dish, preventing any visual input of the obstacle.\nAs the food is moved forwards, note that the animal should contact the obstacle with their forelegs before stepping over it.\nAllow the animal to continue eating while straddling the obstacle between their fore- and hindlegs. During this time, lower the obstacle so that it becomes flush with the walkway to prevent any further visual or tactile inputs.\nFollowing a variable delay period, move the food forwards once again to encourage the animal to resume walking.\nImportantly, perform trials where the obstacle is absent and no foreleg contact occurs for preventing habituation to the obstacle and development of a learned avoidance response.\n\t\t\nIn these tactile obstacle-absent trials, have the animal approach and eat from the food platform, as described in step 3.2.1. However, raise and lower the obstacle (step 3.2.2) before moving the food forward in step 3.2.3. Ensure that a similar delay period where the animal is allowed to continue eating (step 3.2.4) precedes the final continuation of locomotion (step 3.2.5).\nObserve the hindleg stepping in the obstacle-present and obstacle-absent trials to verify normal locomotor behaviors and intact visual obstacle memory prior to cooling.\n4. Video Analyses",
    "NOTE: To assess obstacle memory, analyses during initial training and subsequent testing after cooling loop implantation involve quantifying the peak step height, step clearance, and the horizontal distance between the toe and obstacle at the peak of each step for both visual and tactile paradigms (Figure 2C).\nAnalyze the videos using custom written scripts.\nFor every trial, track each foot by marking the position of the toe closest to the camera throughout each step.\nMeasure the peak step height as the perpendicular distance between the toe and the surface of the walkway at the highest point in each step trajectory (Figure 2C).\nIn the obstacle-present trials, measure the step clearance as the step height directly above the obstacle slot subtracted by the height of the obstacle.\nAdditionally, measure the horizontal distance between the toe and the obstacle at the peak of each step in the obstacle-present trials.\nConfirm that the obstacle memory capabilities are intact prior to the cooling loop implantation by verifying that the peak step height is elevated in the obstacle-present trials in comparison to stepping in the obstacle-absent trials.\n5. Cooling Loop (Cryoloop) Implantation\nImplant cryoloops bilaterally over areas 5 and 7 according to previously reported surgical procedures8 (Figure 3).\nIn brief, for each hemisphere, perform a craniotomy and durotomy from Horsley-Clarke coordinates20 A15 to A25 to expose the juncture of the ansate and lateral sulci.\nPosition individual cooling loops shaped from 23-gauge stainless steel hypodermic tubing with the loop in direct contact with the cortical surface of parietal area 5 or 7.\nSecure the base of each cryoloop to the skull with dental acrylic anchored to the stainless steel screws.\nClose the craniotomies with additional dental acrylic; draw up the skin margins up to the acrylic edges and suture together.\n6. Cortical Cooling Protocol\nExperimental setup",
    "NOTE: Before bringing the animal into the testing room, the cooling circuit is prepared and tested. The cooling circuit consists of a methanol reservoir with an intake tube (3.2 mm O.D., 1.6 mm I.D.), a reciprocating piston pump, and dry ice bath connected via polytetrafluoroethylene tubing (1.6 mm O.D., 0.5 mm I.D.; Figure 4). Additionally, a digital thermometer is required.\n\t\nAdd 500 cc dry ice to 200 mL of methanol in the ice bath. Fit tubing ends snugly over the inlet and outlet of a dummy cryoloop to complete the cooling circuit.\nAttach the thermocouple plug to a digital thermometer for continuous temperature monitoring using a cable composed of two male thermocouple connectors and a thermocouple wire. Ensure that the length of this cable is sufficient to reach the head of the animal when one end is plugged into the thermometer.\nTurn on the piston pump using the switch.\n\t\tNOTE: Methanol should be drawn up from the reservoir, passed through the pump to the dry ice bath where the flowing methanol in the tubing will be cooled to -75 °C. The chilled methanol will then exit the ice bath and run through the attached cryoloop before returning to the methanol reservoir.\nEnsure that the pump setting, length of tubing within the ice bath, and length of tubing from the ice bath to the dummy loops are optimal such that the dummy cryoloop temperature can reach a steady state around -5.0 °C.",
    "NOTE: Such temperatures achieved during this initial setup are often sufficient for achieving test temperatures of 3.0 ± 1.0 °C when the same system is used to cool an implanted cryoloop. Difficulty in attaining sufficient cooling can be solved by adjusting the speed of the pump, increasing the length of tubing submerged within the ice bath, and/or minimizing the length of tubing from the ice bath to the cryoloop.\nIf necessary, lengthen a section of tubing by threading the end of the tube through a tube end fitting and flange the end of the tube with a flanging tool. Attach tubing of a desired length with a similarly flanged end using a connector.\nVerify that all connections are snug and no leaks are present. Once satisfied with the initial setup, switch the pump off, and remove the dummy cryoloop; the circuit is now prepared for a test animal.\nBehavioral testing\nPlace the animal on the testing apparatus. Slide the harness over the head and secure the strap snuggly around the animal. Attach the leash.\nRemove the protective cap of the implanted cryoloop to expose the inlet and outlet tubes. Fit tubing ends snugly over the inlet and outlet tubes of the cryoloop. Connect the thermocouple plug to the digital thermometer.\nBegin the testing session with a visual (step 3.1) or tactile (step 3.2) obstacle memory trial. Follow with additional trials of all four types (visual obstacle-present, visual obstacle-absent, tactile obstacle-present, tactile obstacle-absent) in a random fashion.\n\t\tNOTE: A typical testing session consists of a 'warm' block of trials, where memory-guided obstacle avoidance is observed in the absence of cooling to establish baseline measures.",
    "Switch on the piston pump, and wait for the cryoloop to reach a temperature of 3.0 ± 1.0 °C (1-2 min). Then, run a 'cool' block of trials after the piston pump has been switched on. During this block of trials, if needed, assess contributions of the cooled area to memory-guided. Ensure that the temperature of the cryoloop is maintained at 3.0 ± 1.0 °C throughout the entire block.\n\t\tNOTE: All four trial types should be randomly interspersed throughout the block.\nRun a final 'rewarm' block of trials after the piston pump has been switched off, and the cryoloop has returned to its original temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: Baseline stepping behavior is re-established during this block. Again, all four trial types should be randomly interspersed throughout the block.\nClean-up\nWhen the behavioral testing is concluded, remove the tubing from inlet and outlet tubes. Be conscious of residual methanol that may drip from the tubing ends and may irritate the animal.\nEnsure that the protective cap is replaced. Remove the leash and harness before returning the animal to the colony. Trim the tubing ends (3-4 mm) using a tubing cutter to prevent leaky connections on the next testing day.\n7. Verifying the Extent of Cooling\nAt the end of behavioral testing, confirm that the extent of deactivation is restricted to the region of cortex directly beneath each cryoloop using previously reported techniques8.\n\tNOTE: This can be verified with thermocline mapping12 or with a thermal imaging camera13,14,19.\nSubscription Required.
