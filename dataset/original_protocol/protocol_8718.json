    "Ethics Statement: Procedures involving animal subjects have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine.\n1. Extraction of Temporal Bones\nIdentify temporal bones in the base of the mouse skull13 and scrape away the cranial nerves using standard pattern forceps.\nPlace standard pattern forceps at the tip of the otic capsule and with the thumb of the opposite hand press down on the posterior semicircular canal to dislodge the encapsulated cochlea.\nFree the bottom half of the temporal bone from the skull manually with the thumb and index finger or by using 10.5 cm fine scissors.\n2. Post-fix Temporal Bones\nPlace temporal bones into 2 ml microcentrifuge tubes containing 250 - 500 µl 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in 10 mM phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4 and incubate at RT for 2 - 20 hr.\n\tNOTE: No opening of the apical cap or injection of PFA into the round or oval window is needed. Recommend using methanol free, ultra-pure, electron microscopy (EM) grade PFA that can be purchased at a 16% concentration in glass vials. Once a vial is opened and diluted 1:4 in PBS, making a 4% solution, it can be used for up to 2 weeks when stored at 4 oC (Some antibodies require short fixation and others can tolerate O/N (O/N) fixation).\n3. Decalcify Temporal Bones\nAfter fixation, remove PFA using a pipette and replace with 120 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), slightly more than 2 ml. Make sure to fill the entire 2 ml microcentrifuge tube to prevent air bubbles when the tube is closed.\n\t\nIf not decalcifying immediately, replace PFA with 10 mM PBS pH 7.4 and store samples at 4 oC.",
    "NOTE: After fixation, temporal bones can be stored for variable amounts of time before decalcification depending on the antigens being examined.\nPlace tubes on end-over-end rotator and rotate at 4 rpm at RT. Change EDTA solution daily using a pipette. Length of decalcification depends on the age of the sample and the preference of the scientist doing the dissection.\n\t\nIncubate temporal bones in EDTA using the following guidelines for incubation times:\n\t\tFor samples postnatal day (P) 8 to P15: 2 - 4 hr; For samples P15 to P21: O/N; For samples P21 to P30: 2 O/N; For samples older than P30: 3 or more O/N.\n\t\tNOTE: Decalcification times are subject to users' preference and can be extended as needed. Decalcification time can be reduced by changing the EDTA solution twice a day, about 8 hr apart. Some labs add 1% PFA to the EDTA solution when decalcifying for longer than 3 days to prevent contamination.\nTo determine if the sample is adequately decalcified, place temporal bones on a silicon elastomer-coated dissection dish and gently press forceps onto the snail-shaped cochlea. If the tissue is spongey, then decalcification is complete.\nOnce decalcification is complete, remove EDTA using a pipette and add 500 -1,000 µl of 10 mM PBS pH 7.4. Store samples at 4 oC until ready to dissect.\n4. Create Silicone Elastomer-coated Dissection Dish\nCombine the base and curing agent of a silicone elastomer encapsulant kit according to the manufacturer's instructions and mix thoroughly.\nAdd approximately 2 - 3 tablespoons of powdered charcoal until the solution is black and mix well. \n\tNOTE: Liquid ink or liquid charcoal will not mix with the solution and cannot be used. Silicone elastomer encapsulant kits can be purchased in black, allowing step 4.2 to be omitted.",
    "Pour the solution into 60 mm glass or plastic petri dishes, filling enough to coat the bottom. If bubbles are present, puff with air on the surface. Let stand at least 24 hr at RT to set.\n\tNOTE: Silicone elastomer-coated dishes can be used repeatedly for years. However do not use ethanol for cleaning, as this will cause the silicone elastomer to crack.\n5. Whole Mount Dissection of the Cochlea (for P7 and Older Samples)\nSeparate the basal turn from middle/apical turns\n\t\nPlace one decalcified temporal bone in a silicone elastomer-coated dissection dish filled two-thirds full with 10 mM PBS pH 7.4 and use a stereo dissection microscope for the following steps.\nHold the temporal bone in the vestibular region with #4 or #5 straight jeweler's forceps and using 5 mm Vannas-Tubingen spring scissors, cut away excess otic capsule tissue along the sides and above the apex.\nUsing 2.5 mm Vannas spring scissors, insert one blade into the oval window and make several small cuts along the spiral ligament/lateral wall of the basal turn.\nUsing 5 mm Vannas-Tubingen spring scissors, insert one blade into the region just cut and place the other blade on the outside the temporal bone, medial to the oval window. This cut separates the basal turn from middle and apical turns.\nComplete dissection of the basal turn.\n\t\nUsing 2.5 mm Vannas spring scissors, cut the spiral ganglion nerve fibers that connect to the modiolus to release the tension in the basal turn and cut below the basal turn to separate from vestibular organs.",
    "Using 2.5 mm Vannas spring scissors, make a series of small cuts to remove the spiral ligament/lateral wall from both above and below the organ of Corti. Use #4 or #5 straight jeweler's forceps to guide the tissue. Pin the spiral ganglion nerve fibers to the silicone elastomer-coated dissection dish, but do not hold onto this region as the tissue will tear.\nDuring the previous steps, some of Reissner's membrane will often be removed. If any still remains, grasp the Reissner's membrane with #4 or #5 straight jeweler's forceps and pull away from the organ of Corti.\n\t\tNOTE: The tectorial membrane is rarely visible and typically floats away without requiring a specific step for removal.\nFinally make several cuts to reduce the thickness of the spiral ganglion axons, to make the turn as flat as possible and use #4 or #5 straight jeweler's forceps to transfer the dissected basal turn, by grasping the remaining axons of the spiral ganglion, to a 48-well plate (or chamber slide) containing ~500 µl of 10 mM PBS pH 7.4.\nSeparate middle and apical turns\n\t\nPlace the remaining two-thirds of the cochlea, apical side down.\nUsing 2.5 mm Vannas spring scissors, insert one blade into the scala media where the middle turn used to be connected to the basal turn, and make several small cuts along the spiral ligament/lateral wall of the middle turn.\nUsing 5 mm Vannas-Tubingen spring scissors, insert one blade into the region just cut with the middle turn placed on top of the blade, and place the other blade on the outside the bony labyrinth, at a 90o angle from the apical tip. This separates the middle turn from the apical turn.\nComplete dissection of the middle turn in a similar manner to the basal turn (see steps 5.2.2 to 5.2.4).",
    "Complete dissection of the apical turn.\n\t\nUsing 2.5 mm Vannas spring scissors, open the cap that covers the apical turn. Complete dissection in a similar manner to the basal turn (see steps 5.2.2 to 5.2.4).\n\t\tNOTE: Dissected cochlear turns can be stored in 10 mM PBS pH 7.4 in a 48-well plate (or chamber slide) at 4 oC for several weeks before immunostaining. However PBS will evaporate and needs to be periodically replenished and storage longer than 2 - 3 weeks can result in bacterial or fungal growth on the tissue which can decrease the quality of the image. We recommend long-term storage of samples as undissected temporal bones.\n6. Immunostaining with Fluorescently Tagged Antibodies\nAfter the dissection, store each cochlear turn in a separate well in a 48-well plate (or chamber slide), submerged in ~500 µl of 10 mM PBS pH 7.4. For each of the following steps the cochlear turn should be submerged in liquid, not floating on top or stuck to the side of the well. \n\tNOTE: When removing liquid from each well, it is easy to lose the cochlear turns or suck it up in the pipette tip. Changing solutions with a 200 µl pipette tip using a dissection scope will help prevent this.\nUsing a pipette, remove PBS from each well and replace with ~200 - 300 µl per well of blocking/permeabilization solution (1% Triton X-100, 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 10% normal goat serum (NGS) diluted in 10 mM PBS pH 7.4). Incubate 1 hr at RT on a 3D rotator.\n\tNOTE: If any primary antibody used was made in a goat host, then a secondary anti-goat antibody will be needed and NGS should NOT be used for any of the steps. Normal horse serum can be used as a replacement for NGS.",
    "Remove blocking/permeabilization solution using a pipette and replace with ~100 µl per well of primary antibody solution (0.1% Triton X-100, 1% BSA, and 5% NGS diluted in 10 mM PBS pH 7.4). The dilution factor for each primary antibody varies. Incubate O/N (minimum 14 hr) at 4 oC on a 3D rotator.\n\tNOTE: If more than one primary antibody is used, all can be combined into the same solution for incubation, just make sure that each primary antibody has a different host.\nRemove primary antibody solution using a pipette and perform 3 washes of 10 mM PBS pH 7.4 at ~500 µl per well. Each wash incubates a minimum of 5 min at RT on a 3D rotator.\nRemove last PBS wash using a pipette and replace with ~100 µl per well of secondary antibody solution (0.1% Triton X-100, 1% BSA, and 5% NGS diluted in 10 mM PBS pH 7.4). The dilution factor for each fluorescently tagged secondary antibody is usually 1:500 or 1:1,000. Place 48-well plate in a black box to protect fluorescently tagged secondary antibodies from light. Incubate 2 - 3 hr at RT on a 3D rotator.\n\tNOTE: If more than one secondary antibody is needed, they can be combined into the same solution for incubation. Make sure there is no possibility of cross-labeling (e.g., using goat anti-rabbit and chicken anti-goat secondary antibodies)\nRemove secondary antibody solution using a pipette and perform 3 washes of 10 mM PBS pH 7.4 at ~500 µl per well. Incubate each wash for a minimum of 5 min at RT on a 3D rotator. Keep 48-well plate in a black box to protect from light.",
    "Remove last PBS wash using a pipette and replace with ~100 µl per well of Hoechst 33342 (diluted 1:2,000 in 10 mM PBS pH 7.4) to label nuclei. Incubate 15 - 20 min at RT on a 3D rotator. Keep 48-well plate in a black box to protect from light. Do NOT incubate longer than 20 min.\nRemove Hoechst solution using a pipette and perform 3 washes of 10 mM PBS pH 7.4 at ~500 µl per well. Incubate each wash for a minimum of 5 min at RT on a 3D rotator. Keep 48-well plate in a black box to protect from light.\nAll steps can be extended, except Hoechst incubation, by several hours if needed. To pause the reaction at any stage, just submerge samples in ~500 ul of 10mM PBS pH7.4 and store the 48 -well plate (or chamber slide) at 4 oC until ready to resume the protocol hours or 1 - 2 days later.\n\t \n7. Mount Cochlear Turns on Slides\nLabel slides with pertinent information about the sample and antibodies used.\nPipette ~50 µl of mounting media onto each slide and be careful to prevent bubbles. Centrifuge the tube containing the mounting media to remove any bubbles.\nUsing #4 or #5 straight jeweler's forceps, grasp the axons of the spiral ganglion to gently transfer one cochlear turn from the 48-well plate to the slide and place in the mounting media. Mount one cochlear turn per slide to prevent light exposure and photobleaching during the imaging process.\nUse a stereo dissection microscope to ensure that cochlear turn is not folded, twisted, or near an air bubble. If any of these conditions occur, use #4 or #5 straight jeweler’s forceps to reposition the cochlear turn.",
    "Place one end of a coverslip on the slide and gently release to let the coverslip fall.\nUse a stereo dissection microscope to ensure that the cochlear turn is not folded, twisted, or near an air bubble. If any of these conditions occur, gently move the coverslip back and forth to reposition the cochlear turn.\nPlace slides in a slide folder so that they lay flat. Let mounting media cure O/N at RT (keep in the DARK)\nSeal coverslips with clear nail polish and store at RT or -20 oC until imaged. Slides can be stored in a slide folder or slide box.\n\tNOTE: Slides can be stored long term at -20 oC or -80 oC and fluorescence will be maintained for several months.\nImage slides using a confocal microscope with the appropriate wavelength based on the secondary antibodies used during the immunostaining procedure. Brightness and contrast adjustments can be performed using the imaging software provided by the confocal vendor.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
