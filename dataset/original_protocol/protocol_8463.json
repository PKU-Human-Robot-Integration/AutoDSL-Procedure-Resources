    "Ethics Statement: Wistar rats were mated, maintained and used in the INMED animal facilities, in agreement with European Union and French legislation.\n1. DNA Extraction and Quantification for Array-CGH and WES\nExtract Genomic DNA (gDNA) from human blood leukocytes from patients using an automated DNA isolation robot or commercially available manual DNA extraction kits according to the manufacturer's protocol. Quantify all samples using a spectrophotometer.\n2. Array-CGH Protocol\nRestriction Digestion of gDNA\nDouble digest 500 ng of purified gDNA from a patient and a commercially available human control DNA with RsaI and AluI for 2 h at 37 °C. Use 0.5 μl of 10 U/μL enzyme for each reaction. Incubate for 20 min at 65 °C to inactivate the enzymes and move the sample tubes to ice.\nSample Labelling\nAdd the appropriate volume of Random Primers needed for the microarray format in use to each reaction tube (e.g. 5 µl for 1-pack, 2-pack, and 4-pack microarrays). Mix well by pipetting up and down gently.\nTransfer sample tubes to a thermal cycler. Incubate at 95 °C for 3 min and then at 4 °C for 5 min.\nPrepare one cyanine 3 and one cyanine 5 Labelling Master Mix on ice by mixing the following volumes: 10.0 µl 5X Reaction Buffer, 5.0 µl 10x dNTPs, 3.0 µl Cyanine 3-dUTP or Cyanine 5-dUTP and 1.0 µl Exo(-)Klenow enzyme, 2.0 µl Nuclease-Free Water. Choose the volume of each reagent according to the microarray format in use.\nAdd the Labelling Master Mix to each reaction tube containing the gDNA. Mix well by gently pipetting up and down.\nTransfer sample tubes to a thermal cycler and incubate at 37 °C for 2 h, 65 °C for 10 min and then maintain the samples at 4 °C.\nPurification of labelled gDNA",
    "Add 430 µl of 1x TE (pH 8.0) to each reaction tube.\nPlace a purification column into 2 mL collection tubes and label the columns appropriately. Load each labelled gDNA onto a purification column.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 14,000 x g in a microcentrifuge at room temperature. Discard the flow-through and place the column back in the 2 ml collection tube.\nAdd 480 µL of 1x TE (pH 8.0) to each column. Centrifuge for 10 min at 14,000 x g in a microcentrifuge at room temperature. Discard the flow-through.\nInvert the column into a fresh 2 mL collection tube and centrifuge for 1 min at 1,000 x g in a microcentrifuge at room temperature to collect purified sample.\nBring the sample volume to that requested for the microarray format in use using a concentrator or adding 1x TE (pH 8.0). For example, for 1-pack microarray bring the volume to 80.5 µL. Incubate the sample on ice for 5 min and then pipette the solution up and down 10 times.\nPreparation of labelled gDNA for Hybridization\nCombine test and reference samples using the appropriate cyanine 5-labeled sample and cyanine 3-labeled sample in a fresh 1.5 mL RNase-free tube. For example, for 1-pack microarray ensure that the final volume is 158 µL. Choose the volume of each sample according to the microarray format in use.\nUse a spectrophotometer to measure yield, degree of labelling or specific activity by measuring the absorbance at A260 nm (DNA), A550 nm (cyanine 3), and A650 nm (cyanine 5).\n\t\t\nCalculate yield using the formula: [DNA concentration(ng/µl) x sample volume (µl)]/1,000 (ng/µg). Calculate Specific Activity using the formula: pmol per µl of dye/µg per µl of gDNA.",
    "NOTE: For example, for 0.5 µg of input DNA, the yield should be 8 to 11 µg and the specific activity (pmol/µg) should be 25 to 40 for the Cyanine-3 labelled sample and 20 to 35 for the Cyanine-5 labelled sample.\nTo prepare the amount of Hybridization Master Mix needed for the microarray format in use, mix the following reagents: 50 µL Cot-1 DNA (1.0 mg/ml), 52 µL 10x aCGH Blocking Agent and 260 µl 2x HI-RPM Hybridization Buffer.\nAdd the appropriate volume of the Hybridization Master Mix to the 1.5 ml RNase-free tube that contains the labelled gDNA to obtain the total volume required for the microarray format in use.
