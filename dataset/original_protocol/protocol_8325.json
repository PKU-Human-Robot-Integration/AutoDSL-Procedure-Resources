    "The animal experiments performed in this study were approved by the Norwegian University of Life Sciences, following guidelines for the care and welfare of research animals.\n1. Preparation of Solutions\nCalibrate the osmometer and pH meter instruments according to the manufacturer’s instructions to ensure correct measurements.\nPrepare 500 mL of Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (dPBS), adjusting the pH to 7.75 (step 1.2.1) and the osmolality to 290 mOsm/kg (step 1.2.2) before a sterile filtration (step 1.2.3).\nAdjust the pH to 7.75 with a calibrated pH meter by carefully adding drops of a 1 M NaOH solution while carefully stirring the solution.\nMeasure the osmolality of the solution using a calibrated osmometer and calculate the amount of mannitol needed to increase the osmolality to 290 mOsm/kg. Add the required amount of mannitol and then measure the osmolality of the solution again to ensure the correct adjustment.\n\t\tNOTE: The amount of mannitol needed depends on the osmolality measured, which usually varies between different batches. One molecule of mannitol equals 1 osmotic particle.\nSterile-filter the dPBS solution using a 0.2 µm filter.\n\t\tNOTE: The solution may be stored at 4 °C for at least 3 months.\nPrepare 500 mL of Leibovitz (L-15) culture medium without L-glutamine and bicarbonate, and supplement it with 10 mM NaHCO3 (step 1.3.1), 4.5 mM glucose (step 1.3.2), and 2 mM commercially available glutamine (step 1.3.3). Adjust the solution to 290 mOsm/kg (step 1.3.4), sterile-filter it (step 1.3.5), and add 2.5 mL of a penicillin-streptomycin solution (step 1.3.6).\n\tNOTE: The solution may be stored at 4 °C for at least 4 weeks.\n\t\nAdd 420 mg of NaHCO3 per 500 mL of culture medium to achieve a 10 mM solution.\nAdd 405 mg of glucose per 500 mL of culture medium to achieve a 4.5 mM solution.",
    "Add 5 mL of 100x stock of a glutamine solution in 500 mL of culture medium to achieve a 2 mM solution. Stir until all solutes are dissolved.\nAdjust the solution to 290 mOsm/kg with mannitol using an osmometer (as performed in step 1.2.2).\nPerform a sterile filtration of the L-15 medium using a 0.2 µm filter.\nAfter the sterile filtration, add 2.5 mL of a penicillin-streptomycin solution, corresponding to 50 U/mL of penicillin and 50 µg/mL of streptomycin.\nPrepare 50 mL of a trypsin solution using 1 mg/mL of (0.1%) trypsin type II-S dissolved in the modified dPBS (prepared in step 1.2). Make aliquots of 2 mL in sterile plastic tubes and store them at -20 °C until use.\n\tNOTE: Aliquots of 2 mL can be stored at -20 °C for at least 3 months.\nPrepare 50 mL of a trypsin inhibitor solution using 1 mg/mL of (0.1%) trypsin inhibitor type I-S, and supplement it with 2 µg/mL of DNase I dissolved in the modified dPBS (prepared in step 1.2). Make aliquots of 2 mL in sterile plastic tubes and store them at -20 °C until use.\n\tNote: Aliquots of 2 mL can be stored at -20 °C for at least 3 months.\n2. Preparation of Equipment\nPrepare glass pipettes by fire polishing the tip for the cell dissociation. Make tips with 2 different size categories (a medium opening of 0.6–0.8 µm and a small opening of 0.4–0.6 µm) by playing with the time and the distance from the flame while simultaneously turning the pipette. Place the glass pipettes in a clean glass container and autoclave them (using the solid mode at 105 °C for 45 min).\nPrepare a polystyrene box with ice.",
    "Prepare a plastic tube with 1.5 mL of modified dPBS (prepared in step 1.2) to transfer the pituitaries to during the dissection and keep it on ice.\nPrepare a 15 mL tube with 10 mL of modified dPBS (prepared in step 1.2) and keep it on ice until the cell dissociation.\nPrepare fresh or thaw aliquots of the trypsin and trypsin inhibitor solutions (prepared in steps 1.4 and 1.5) and keep them on ice until use.\nSet the water bath to 26 °C before starting the dissection to allow the water to reach the desired temperature before the chemical dissociation of the pituitaries.\nClean all dissection tools with 70% ethanol before, during, and after use, including fine forceps to use for the dissection and fine needles and a wax plate to pin the fish. Use clean gloves (change and clean frequently) during the entire procedure to avoid a potential contamination of the cells.\n3. Pituitary Dissection and Cell Dissociation\nEuthanize the fish by immersing it in ice slush (0 °C). Leave the fish in the ice slush for at least 1 min to ensure an irreversible hypothermic shock.\n\tNOTE: Immobilization and equilibrium loss will occur after a few seconds. Make sure the fish is completely submerged in the ice water and does not lie on top of the ice, as the latter will lead to suffocation and potential skin burns instead of a rapid and humane hypothermic shock.\nQuickly transfer the fish in a net to a wax plate under the dissection microscope and destroy the spine by a needle punch through the neck.",
    "Pin the head of the fish to the wax plate using fine needles, by inserting one needle in the front (over the mouth) and one on each side of the head (behind the brain) to stabilize the head before the dissection.\nView the fish under the dissection microscope and gently scrape off the scales at the top of the head using fine forceps with an angled tip.\nCarefully insert the angled tip of the fine forceps under the skin from the side of the head and remove the skull roof by slowly moving the forceps in the direction of the mouth, while holding a firm grip to the forceps enclosing the skull roof.\nCut the spinal cord completely off using forceps with an angled tip.\n\tNOTE: Time is an important factor, so work efficiently and accurately to limit the time spent from the dissection of the pituitaries until the cells are plated in the dish. After some practice, pituitary dissection should take around 2–3 min per fish, of which only around 10 s are needed to pick the pituitary when the brain is already exposed.\nCarefully flip the brain over towards the mouth to expose the pituitary and dissect it with clean forceps with a straight tip. Transfer the pituitary to a plastic tube containing 1.5 mL modified dPBS (for details, see step 2.3) placed on ice. Check the tip of the forceps under the microscope to ensure that the pituitary is successfully added to the tube and nothing is left on the forceps.",
    "NOTE: Dissect as many pituitaries as needed, depending on the number of culture dishes that are going to be prepared simultaneously. As a rule of thumb, calculate at least 10 pituitaries from adult fish per dish to have an appropriate density of cells (which depends on the downstream application).\nSpin down the pituitaries in a tabletop centrifuge for 1–2 s at room temperature. Carefully remove the dPBS using a glass pipette and take care to avoid removing any pituitaries.\nAdd 1 mL of the trypsin solution (prepared in step 1.4) to wash the pituitaries, spin them down in a tabletop centrifuge for 1–2 s, and remove most of the liquid using a glass pipette before adding an additional 1 mL of trypsin solution.\nIncubate the tube in a water bath at 26 °C for 30 min, preferably with gentle shaking, or alternatively, flick the tube a couple of times during the incubation period.\nSpin down the pituitaries in a tabletop centrifuge for 1–2 s at room temperature and make sure all pituitaries are located at the bottom of the tube. Remove most of the trypsin solution with a glass pipette and add 1 mL of the trypsin inhibitor solution (prepared in step 1.5) to inactivate the trypsin and wash the pituitaries.\nCollect the pituitaries at the bottom of the tube by spinning them down in a tabletop centrifuge for 1–2 s at room temperature. Remove most of the liquid with a glass pipette and add 1 mL of the trypsin inhibitor solution (prepared in step 1.5). Place the tube on a water bath at 26 °C for 20 min, preferably with gentle shaking, or alternatively, flick the tube a couple of times during the incubation period to inactivate the trypsin.",
    "Prepare a 35 mm poly-d-lysine-coated cell culture dish with a central glass bottom by adding 2 mL of L-15 medium and letting that incubate for at least 10 min at 26 °C and with 1% CO2 so that it can reach the right temperature and pH before plating the cells.\n\tNOTE: A plastic cell culture dish can also be used. The main advantage of using a dish with a centralized glass bottom is that the area where the cells are plated is smaller, and therefore, fewer pituitary cells are required per dish. Some downstream applications might also require a glass bottom (i.e., some imaging techniques).\nSet the cooling centrifuge for the 15 mL tubes to 4 °C to allow it to reach the desired temperature before starting the mechanical dissociation.\nCollect the pituitaries at the bottom of the tube by spinning down the tube with the trypsin inhibitor solution (from step 3.11) in a tabletop centrifuge for 1–2 s at room temperature and make sure all pituitaries are located at the bottom of the tube before carefully removing most of the trypsin inhibitor solution using a glass pipette.\n\tNote: Perform all the following steps of the protocol in a laminar flow bench (LAF) certified for cell work to avoid a contamination of the cells.\nAdd 1 mL of ice-cold modified dPBS (prepared in step 2.4) to the pituitary tissue pieces and gently suck the tissue pieces up and down (6–7x) in a fire-polished glass pipette (prepared in step 2.1).\n\tNOTE: Temperature is an essential aspect, so keep all solutions at 4 °C. From this point onward, perform all steps on ice when possible.",
    "Spin down the tissue pieces in a tabletop centrifuge for 1–2 s at room temperature and carefully transfer the upper part of the dPBS containing the dissociated cells (almost 1 mL) to a new 15 mL tube placed on ice. Avoid moving the pipette towards the bottom of the tube where the tissue pieces are left.\nRepeat step 3.16–3.17, dissociating the cells in 1 mL of ice-cold dPBS at a time, until all 10 mL of dPBS is used. Start using a glass pipette with a medium-sized opening and switch to a glass pipette with a smaller opening towards the end (for the last 3–4 mL of dPBS added) of the dissociation. If there are still visible tissue pieces towards the end of the dissociation procedure, increase the pipetting to approximately 10x towards the 2 last steps of dPBS for dissociation, and finally leave the residual tissue pieces behind. Resuspend the cells gently and avoid creating bubbles as it may cause cell damage when the cells attach to the surface of the bubbles.\n\tNOTE: This is a critical step of this protocol and requires some training to achieve a good result.\nBalance the tube in the centrifuge (pre-cooled to 4 °C) and spin down the cells at 200 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Make sure to mark the side of the tube where the cell pellet will be.\nCarefully remove the tube from the centrifuge and gently transfer the supernatant with a glass pipette to an empty 15 mL plastic tube directly after the centrifugation. Be sure to remove most of the supernatant but take care to avoid losing the small (often invisible) cell pellet.\nCarefully resuspend the cell pellet in 50–100 µL of L-15 culture medium.",
    "NOTE: At this step, it is possible to count the cells and/or perform a viability test (such as a cell counting in the presence of trypan blue using a hemocytometer), but beware that using part of the cell suspension for this purpose will lower the yield. Avoid using a large suspension volume as it will increase the risk of cells diffusing outside of the center of the dish.\nCarefully drip the dissociated cells in the middle of the cell culture dish containing 2 mL of the L-15 medium (prepared in step 3.13). Allow the cells to sink to the bottom of the dish for approximately 5 min before moving them to the incubator, to avoid having the cells spread outside of the sunken part of the glass bottom.\nIncubate the dish at 26 °C and 1% CO2 to allow all the cells to sink thoroughly and attach to the bottom of the dish.\nAfter 30 min, look at the cells in the microscope to make sure they have attached to the culture dish.\nContinue to incubate the cells at 26 °C and 1% CO2.\nCarefully change most of (but not all) the medium every 3–4 days.\n\tNote: Avoid changing the medium more frequently, as it may disturb the cells and make them detach from the glass bottom. Use the cells for experiments within a week after seeding them.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
