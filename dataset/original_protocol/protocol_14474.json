    "All animal research was approved by the University of California, San Francisco Committee on Animal Research and was performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (US Department of Health and Human Services, Publication No. 85-23, 1985). Animals were closely monitored by veterinarians of the UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), accredited by AAALAC. One female Sprague-Dawley rat with an 8 day-old litter (10 pups per litter) was obtained. The mother and her pups were given food and water ad libitum and housed in a temperature- and light-controlled animal care facility with daily enrichment, per IACUC protocol, until the pups were 10 days old. All surgical instruments used in this procedure were autoclaved to ensure sterility. Sterility of instrument tips is maintained throughout the surgery.\n1. Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion\nWeigh the pup and ensure that it is the proper weight (19-21 g). Anesthetize the pup in 3% isoflurane in 100% O2 and ensure that there is no response to a foot pinch. Maintain the body surface temperature between 35.5 °C and 37 °C with the use of a heating pad under the surgical stage.\nSecure the animal in a supine position with tape across the shoulder regions. Using sterile cotton swabs, swab the anterior cervical area with povidone-iodine solution followed by a swab of 70% ethanol in double-distilled water, alternating between each solution for four swabs total.\nLocally infiltrate 0.25% bupivacaine into the planned incision site. Using a stereoscope, make a midline 5 to 7 mm anterior cervical incision to expose the common carotid artery (CCA). Place 2-4 retractors to keep the cavity open and the artery exposed.",
    "Locate the internal carotid artery (ICA), occipital artery (OA), and external carotid artery (ECA). Groom the arteries to get a clear view. Be careful not to disturb the vagus nerve.\n\tNOTE: For sham-operated pups, the inicision is left open and the arteries are exposed, after which the incision is sutured closed. The total anesthesia time is equivalent to that of the occlusion surgery.\nCut 1.5 cm of 6-0 silk braided suture thread. Unbraid the suture, pulling out single strands. Make sure that the single strands are neat and not frayed.\n\tNOTE: If necessary, smoothe the frayed ends by dipping the single strand in sterile water and grooming the strand with forcep tips.\nWhile holding the suture strand with 45-degree forceps, move the forceps in a sweeping arc motion to go under the ICA so that the forcep tips emerge between the ICA and OA.\n\tNOTE: If the dissection is done well, this step will be relatively easy. If the ICA and OA are touching, be careful not to rupture the arteries when using the forceps to isolate the ICA. If bleeding occurs, apply pressure to the artery with the forceps until the bleeding stops. Absorb the blood with a sterile swab.\nGrab the end of the suture strand that is held by the forceps and pull it so that the end is easy to access. Release the strand from the forceps and back the forceps out from under the ICA, reversing the motion in step 1.5 (Figure 1A).\nTie a temporary ligature around the ICA at the base, closest to where it separates from the CCA.",
    "NOTE: It is important to tie the knot so that the end of the strand that will be pulled to remove the knot is long enough (greater than 1 mm, less than 3 mm) to easily grasp with forceps, while ensuring that there is an appropriate amount of suture strand on the other side of the knot for retraction.\nCarefully retract the ICA laterally and use a clip to secure the strand to excess skin near the axilla region on the side opposite the incision. Ensure that this retracting strand is taut enough to stop blood flow before proceeding to the next step, to minimize the risk of uncontrolled bleeding. Observe that the artery is flat and pale.\n\tNOTE: Do not over-retract, as it can cause a partial or full tear of the ICA. The retraction can be adjusted just before making the arteriotomy by pulling on the strand on the side opposite to the clip.\nUse 45° forceps to grasp another unbraided suture strand and loop it under and around the ICA, as in step 1.5. Position this strand lateral to the retraction strand (Figure 1B).\n\tNOTE: This step can also be done prior to retraction. If unsure about the quality of retraction, this knot can be very loosely tied before the next step.\nCut a 0.2 mm arteriotomy midway between the tied and untied ligatures, erring closer to the tied ligature.\n\tNOTE: Blood remaining in the tied-off artery may empty through the arteriotomy but should not exceed 5 µL. If bleeding persists, carefully pull the retraction strand to increase retraction, with care to avoid damaging the artery from excessive tension.",
    "Using a metric ruler, measure the occluding suture and cut the suture with an extra allowance of 2-3 mm for the removal of the occluder during reperfusion. Hold the occluder with 45-degree forceps and use straight forceps to create a bend at the appropriate length to reach the MCA, marking a stopping point for advancement.\n\tNOTE: A 10 mm occlusion length from the silicone tip end to the bend is used for P10 Sprague Dawley or Long Evans rat pups in this weight range.\nUsing 45° forceps, feed the silicone-coated nylon occlusion suture into the arteriotomy and advance the suture to the bend that marks the pre-determined distance to the MCA (Figure 1C). Ensure that advancement feels smooth; immediately stop advancement if resistance is felt. During advancement, aim the suture in a direction that is parallel to the CC/ECA, towards the head.\n\tNOTE: If the suture is advanced dorsally, toward the animal's spine, it may run into the pterygopalatine artery (PTA). If resistance is felt after 3-5 mm of advancement, the suture has hit the PTA junction. Back the occluder out of the artery until the silicone head is near the arteriotomy before adjusting the advancement direction. It is not necessary to completely remove the occluder from the arteriotomy.\nSecure the occluder by tying a temporary ligature, using the strand from step 1.10 (Figure 1D).\nRemove the retractor clip. Trim the strands of both of the temporary ligatures so that the strand of the knot that is pulled to remove the knot is easy to grasp with straight forceps and is longer than the strand that is pulled to tighten the knot.\n\tNOTE: The strands must be short enough so that they do not tangle in the cavity after closure.",
    "Remove the retractors and close the cavity using 6-0 braided silk to create three to four interrupted sutures.\nRemove the pup from anesthesia and place it on a heating pad in room air. Monitor the pup until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency and ensure that it has fully recovered before returning it to the dam. Ensure that the pup maintains a body surface temperature between 35.5 °C and 37 °C.\nDuring occlusion, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) under isoflurane anesthesia can be used to verify the appropriate induction of injury. Figure 2 demonstrates ongoing ischemic injury detected by DW-MRI during tMCAO9.\n\tNOTE: Diffusion-weighted spin echo planar imaging is performed 10-15 min prior to reperfusion. The entire brain is imaged with serial 2-mm-thick coronal sections using the following pulse sequence settings: TR/TE=5,000/60 ms, 4 averages, field of view = 35 mm, data matrix = 128x128, diffusion gradient duration = 20 ms, separation = 29.7 ms, amplitude = 70mT/m, and b-factor = 1,045 s/mm2. Animals exhibiting a lack of cortical involvement or atypical ischemic injury, such as in the brainstem, are excluded.\n2. Reperfusion\nNOTE: Occlusion is performed for 3 h to cause a moderate-to-severe amount of injury involving the striatum and cortex.\nAt approximately 2 h and 50 min following occlusion of the MCA, anesthetize the pup in 3% isoflurane in 100% O2. Maintain a body surface temperature between 35.5 °C and 37 °C with the use of a heating pad under the surgical stage.\nRemove the interrupted sutures from step 1.16 and locate the junction, which is marked by the two ligatures and the tail end of the occluding suture.",
    "NOTE: Sham-operated animals are induced and remain under anesthesia for an equivalent time period to the occluded animals. The incision is once again opened and sutured closed. For sham-operated animals, proceed to step 2.11.\nCarefully untie the most lateral knot previously tied in step 1.14 by pulling the longer strand.\n\tNOTE: If there is resistance in untying the knot, stop to ensure that the correct strand of the knot is being pulled. If resistance continues, increase magnification for a better view. Be cautious when untying, as it is possible to damage the artery during this step.\nRemove the suture strand from the cavity.\nAt exactly 3 h following MCA occlusion, slowly back the occluding suture out of the artery. There will be no resistance.\n\tNOTE: In most cases, there will be no bleeding. If a small amount of bleeding occurs, apply pressure to the artery at the arteriotomy site.\nUse forceps to apply pressure to the arteriotomy, as the next step restores ICA blood flow for reperfusion.\nCarefully untie the medial knot using the same method as in step 2.3.\nRemove the suture strand from the body and apply a hemostatic agent to the arteriotomy to stop bleeding.\nEnsure that the bleeding has stopped.\n\tNOTE: Return of the artery's original shape and red color confirms that ICA blood flow has been restored.\nRemove the retractors and close the cavity with three to four interrupted sutures of 6-0 braided silk.\nRemove the pup from anesthesia and place it on a heating pad in room air. Monitor it until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency and ensure full recovery before returning it to the dam. Ensure that the pup maintains a body surface temperature between 35.5 °C and 37 °C.",
    "Inspect the pups daily for 5 days. Recprd their weights and inspect the incision sites closely for appropriate healing. Remove the sutures after 7-14 days. Post-tMCAO injury can be imaged with MRI, if desired9.\n\tNOTE: Animals may lose up to 1 g of weight on the first day but will typically regain the weight without intervention and be within a similar weight range to controls by days 4-5. Rarely, a pup may lose excessive weight or have difficulty feeding, requiring oral gavage feeds for 2-3 days.\nAt P21, injury can be reliably assessed with sensorimotor behavioral tests, such as rotarod or cylinder rearing. Cognitive testing can be performed as early as 4-6 weeks of age using assessments such as novel object recognition or the Morris water maze13.\nEuthanize the rats by intraperitoneal injection of Euthasol (50 mg/kg) for brain harvest11,12.\nHistological analysis to assess injury volume or response to interventions can be performed with cresyl violet or H&E staining (Figure 3)10."
