    "1. Equipment and Supplies\nMount a Faraday cage on top of the anti vibration table (TMI) to decrease the background noise.\nThe simultaneous patch clamp amperometry recording system requires an inverted microscope with excellent DIC optics and a long working distance lens. Connect the microscope lighthouse to a car battery. This DC light source for the system will further decrease the electrical noise.\nHydraulic micromanipulators (Siskiyou) further decrease noise. In our configuration, we use a right handed manipulator for the whole cell recording, and the left handed for amperometry.\n2. Prepare Electrodes for Recording\nPull patch electrodes using quartz pipettes on a P-2000 puller (Sutter). Our pull lasts approximately 5 sec, with two heat cycles. This heat time has resulted in consistent resistance (3-4 MΩ) in our whole cell patch pipettes.\nFill the electrode with the pipette solution containing 2 mM dopamine and mount it on the right manipulator. Wrap the container holding the pipette solution containing DA with aluminum foil. Keep on ice. Dopamine is oxidizable. Keeping the solution on ice, protected from light will decrease the oxidation rate of dopamine.\nGently remove a ProCFE (Dagan) low noise carbon fiber amperometric electrode from the storage box, fill with mercury, mount onto the amperometric adaptor (as depicted in Figure 1), and then mount on the right maniupulator. Protect the tip of the carbon fiber from damage by holding the far end of the carbon fiber. Inspect the electrode with a lab microscope to ensure the tip is clean and intact.",
    "Examine the integrity of the amperometric electrode by putting the electrode in a glass bottom Petri dish containing external solution. Record a baseline current in the absence of dopamine. Add 10 μl of a 1mM DA solution to the dish. A good amperometric electrode records an increase in the oxidative current. Repeat this step at the start and end of each experiment to make certain the amperometric electrode works properly.\n3. Prepare the Primary Neuronal Culture of Dopamine Neurons or Cells Engineered to Express Dopamine Transporter in Glass Bottom Petri Dishes\nGently wash the cells or dopamine neurons three times with warm external solution.\nMount the glass bottom Petri dish onto the microscope stage.\n4. Visualize Cell and Perform Experiment\nFind the correct focal point to clearly visualize the cells. Place positive pressure on the patch electrode. Then, gently bring both electrodes down into the solution, and close to the cell.\nPosition the amperometric electrode next to the cell (on left side), and the patch electrode on the right.\nAttain a gigaohm seal on the cell with the patch electrode. Rupture the seal with suction to achieve whole cell configuration.\nAllow 5-8 min for dialysis of internal solution containing dopamine into the cell.\nUse desired voltage step or ramp protocol. Simultaneously acquire data from both the patch pipette and the amperometric electrode to measure whole cell currents and reverse transport of dopamine through the dopamine transporter while the membrane potential is controlled via the patch pipette.\nSubscription Required.
