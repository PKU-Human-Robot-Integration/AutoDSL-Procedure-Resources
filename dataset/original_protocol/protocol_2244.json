    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nInfection of mice with Mtb – Day 0\nTiming: ∼3 h\nIn this step, we infect mice with 107–108 CFU of Mtb using lateral tail vein injection.\nBased on the previously evaluated CFU number (see “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]” section), thaw the appropriate number of bacterial stocks. Pool the stocks together and centrifuge them at 10,000 × g for 2 min at 20°C–25°C.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend the bacteria pellet using PBS-Tween to obtain a suspension of the desired CFU in 100 μL. We recommend infecting each mouse with 107–108 CFU.\nNote: A high CFU i.v. infection is required to deposit sufficient Mtb in lungs and spleen to assess the effects of a treatment. The auxotroph strain Mtb mc26206 used in this protocol does not proliferate in vivo. Therefore, the CFU deposited post-infection will only decrease over the course of the experiment.\nPrepare at least n + 3 aliquots of 110 μL (100 μL of bacterial suspension effectively injected + 10 μL of extra volume to account for the syringe dead space), where n is the number of mice to be injected.\nNote: Each aliquot will be used for a single mouse/injection. The extra aliquots are used as (1) backup and (2) for agar plates as control to verify the injected CFU.\nTo calculate the exact injected CFU, make serial dilutions of one or more of the aliquots prepared in step 3 and inoculate the appropriate dilution(s) in 7H10 agar plates. The CFU are usually very consistent with what was determined in steps 9 and 10 of the “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]” section.",
    "Critical: It is very important to add a cohort to evaluate the deposited CFU at 24 h post infection. This will allow for assessing how variable the infection procedure is and to determine the actual number of CFU deposited before any treatments begin.\nPrepare a separate syringe with needle for each animal, drawing all 100 μL of Mtb suspension into the needle and syringe. Ensure that the bacteria are not deposited at the bottom of the tube by vortexing or pipetting the Mtb suspension before drawing it into the syringe.\nWarm the tail to cause vasodilation using a heat source such as the restrainer’s built-in light source, by soaking the tail in warm water (max temperature of 40°C) or using a heat lamp (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1850-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Lateral tail vein injection of mice for Mtb infection\n(A) The tail of the mouse can be warmed using methods such as a light source, warm water, or a red heat lamp for vasodilation and ease of injection.\n(B) The scheme indicates the position of the veins in the mouse tail.\n(C) Hold the tail taut between the thumb and index finger (left), then inject. If the needle is in the vein, a flash of blood may be seen (right) then proceed with the injection.\nNote: Heat lamps with red bulbs are more likely to cause hyperthermia and animals must be carefully monitored. The time under the lamp should be limited to 1–2 min and the lamp should be placed no closer than 1–2 feet from the cage. Signs of hyperthermia include red extremities, rapid respiration or panting, and decreased activity.",
    "With the mouse placed in the restraint device, locate one of the two lateral tail veins in the middle third of the tail by rotating the tail slightly to either side (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). The veins appear as blue lines down either side of the tail.\nRestrain the tail:\nGently pull the tail straight toward you, holding it between your thumb and first finger approximately 2/3 of the way down the length of the tail. The tail should have no slack.\nPosition your thumb lower than your first finger with the tail slightly bent (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C, left).\nCritical: Do not squeeze or bend the tail too much or the vein will blanch and potentially cause injury.\nWith the bevel of the needle facing up and the needle parallel to the vein, steady the hub of the needle on top of your thumb and slide the needle forward into the tail vein until the bevel is fully inserted.\nConfirm the location by gently applying negative pressure to the plunger; if the needle is in the vein, you may see a flash of blood (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C, right). If you do not see this, check the angle of the needle while maintaining negative pressure and redirect the needle until you see a flash of blood.\nOnce proper needle placement is confirmed, proceed with the injection by smoothly depressing the plunger until the solution has been fully administered.\nNote: If the needle is in the vein, there will be no resistance while injecting and the vein itself will blanch. If the needle is not in the vein, resistance will be felt, and the fluid will cause discoloration around the vein or a subcutaneous bleb.",
    "Pull the needle straight out and discard the syringe/needle directly into a biohazardous sharps container without recapping. Use a new needle and syringe for each animal.\nLoosen the restraint device and apply light pressure to the puncture site with a dry piece of gauze until the bleeding has stopped. Remove the mouse from the restraint device and place it back into its cage.\nBegin the treatments 24 h after the mice are infected.\nFor the 24 h cohort, do not administer any treatments. Instead, proceed to cardiac puncture and serum collection, as well as lung and spleen collection and CFU plating.\nTreatment of mice with rifampicin and SMIP-30 – Day 1–13\nTiming: ∼3 h every 2 days until the end of the experiment\nIn this step, we prepare solutions of rifampicin and SMIP-30 and administer them through drinking water and intraperitoneal injection, respectively.\nNote: We usually conduct experiments within a 14-day period. Due to its auxotrophic nature, this strain does not replicate in mice, and it is cleared by the immune system over time. A 14-day period allows enough remaining bacteria to perform CFU analyses and to evaluate possible differences among the tested treatments. As such, the steps below are optimized for a regimen of treatments being administered in a 14-day period, starting on day 1 post-infection. We stop treatments 24 h before the endpoint on day 14, to reduce the risk of drug carry-over during the CFU analysis. Depending on the regimen and compounds to be tested, you may choose your own treatment frequencies.",
    "Note: In this experiment, we administer (i) rifampicin through drinking water ad libitum, changing the water bottle to refresh the antibiotic every 2 days, and (ii) SMIP-30 through intraperitoneal injection every second day. Other methods of drug delivery such as oral gavage can also be used, though we have not tested other methods. Adapt the steps according to your specific experiment.\nPrepare a solution of SMIP-30 in order to inject a dose of 25 mg/kg in a volume of 200 μL. Prepare at least n + 3 aliquots of SMIP-30 and vehicle, where n is the number of mice to be injected. Each aliquot will be used for a single mouse/injection. The extra aliquots are used as backup.\nNote: To be precise in the drug dosage, weigh the animals at day 0 (before the Mtb infection) to estimate the average weight. For female BALB/c of 8–10 weeks of age, we considered an average weight of 20 g.\nPrepare 200 mL of rifampicin at 20 mg/L directly in the drinking bottle of each cage of mice to be treated.\nNote: We observed that each mouse drinks ∼2–3 mL of water every 2 days. This water consumption is observed for BALB/c, 8–10-week-old females, 20 g body weight. We prepared 200 mL of rifampicin water to ensure that more than enough is available. If you are using compounds that are expensive and cannot be wasted, adjust the volume of water accordingly.",
    "Note: A rifampicin dose of 20 mg/L administered ad libitum in drinking water is a subtherapeutic dose for Mtb mc26206, since it does not significantly affect the in vivo CFU at 2 weeks of treatment when used as monotherapy. We selected this dose in order to appreciate any potential effects with combination treatment. The mc26206 strain does show sensitivity to rifampicin as we have tested doses of 80 and 160 mg/L, which does result in dose-dependent reduction in CFU (see Expected Outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]).\nNote: If higher doses of rifampicin or other antibiotics are administered via drinking water, it might be helpful to add a sweetener like sucrose (3%), in order to make the water more palatable. Indeed, many antibiotics display degrees of bitterness, which prevent the mice from drinking properly. If any sweetener is added to the antibiotic solution, remember to add the same amount of sweetener in the vehicle bottles.\nAdminister 200 μL of SMIP-30 or vehicle to each mouse using intraperitoneal injections.\nPrepare a separate syringe with needle for each animal. A syringe with 27-gauge needle was used for our experimental compound.\nDraw the required volume of test compound or vehicle into the needle and syringe. Rotate the needle so that the bevel points “up”.\nRestrain the mouse with its head tilted towards the ground so that its head is lower than its hind end (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). This allows the abdominal viscera to shift cranially and minimize accidental puncture of abdominal organs at the injection site.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1850-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Intraperitoneal administration of compound treatment\n(A) Restrain the mouse by its scruff tilting its head down and hold it stretched with the tail pinned by a finger.\n(B) Inject the mouse in the lower abdominal quadrant. The injection sites are indicated in the inside panel.",
    "(C and D) When negative pressure is observed (C), proceed with the injection (D).\nIdentify anatomical landmarks. The preferred injection site is the lower left or right abdominal quadrant to avoid damage to the urinary bladder, cecum and other abdominal organs (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B, insight).\nInsert needle parallel to the linea alba at a 30°–45° angle horizontal with the bevel up until the entire bevel is within the abdominal cavity (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nPull back on the plunger to ensure there is negative pressure prior to injecting. If negative pressure is observed (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C), proceed with the injection (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nNote: Aspiration of green material, yellow liquid or blood may indicate that the intestinal tract, the bladder, or an abdominal vessel has been punctured. If so, remove the needle from the animal, discard the syringe and repeat the injection.\nAdminister rifampicin by placing the drinking bottle with rifampicin solution into the cage. Due to its light sensitivity, use foil to wrap the water bottles containing rifampicin.\nRepeat the drug administrations every 2 days, with the final administration at day 13 post-infection.\nAt day 14 post-infection, proceed to cardiac puncture, lung and organ harvesting, and CFU plating for all remaining mice.\nCritical: Body weight measurements and visual examinations must be conducted during the course of the experiment to assess the health and wellbeing of the mice and highlight potential adverse effects caused by the drugs or by the procedures. We consider any loss of body weight greater than 15% to be an endpoint. Make sure that your protocol considers and specifies potential endpoints due to toxic effects or adverse reactions.\nBlood collection by intra-cardiac puncture – Day 1 and 14\nTiming: ∼3 h\nIn this step, we perform cardiac puncture to collect blood from mice.",
    "Note: We perform cardiac puncture and collect the blood for isolation of serum from the 24 h cohort of mice on day 1 and all remaining mice on day 14. The steps are the same.\nNote: This procedure is designed to obtain a single and large blood sample of good quality. It is a non-survival method (end-point procedure) and requires general anesthesia.\nAnesthetize the mouse with isoflurane (or any alternative deep anesthesia procedure permitted in your animal usage protocol) and place it in the dorsal recumbency position, while inhaling the anesthetic through the isoflurane nozzle (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1850-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Blood withdrawal by cardiac puncture (terminal procedure)\n(A) Anesthetize the mouse with isoflurane.\n(B) Confirm the mouse is deeply anesthetized by checking for the lack of the pedal reflex by pinching its foot. No reactions should be noticed.\n(C) Locate the xiphoid process (indicated in the inside panel) and insert the needle (with plunger slightly pulled to create negative pressure) into the left ventricle of the heart.\n(D) If the heart is successfully pierced, blood will automatically begin to fill the syringe as a result of the negative pressure.\n(E) Pull on the plunger to collect the blood.\nContinue with the procedure only when the mouse is deeply anesthetized. The anesthetic depth must be confirmed with one of the accepted methods, such as the lack of pedal reflex, Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B.\nSpray the bodies with 70% ethanol.\nLocate the xiphoid process of the sternum and insert a 25G needle with 1 cc syringe bevel up into the left ventricle of the heart (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nInsert the syringe with the plunger slightly pulled, in order to have negative pressure inside the syringe. If the puncture hits the heart properly, the blood will automatically start filling the syringe (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).",
    "Once steady blood flow into the needle has been confirmed, stabilize the needle hub and withdraw as much blood as necessary (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E). Usually, it is possible to collect up to 0.8–1 mL of blood.\nNote: It can be difficult to reach the heart the first time you insert the needle. You may need to move the needle at different angles. If no blood is drawn, remove your needle and insert again at a different angle. If the needle gets clogged, change the syringe.\nRelease the collected blood into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). To reduce hemolysis, it is recommended to carefully remove the needle from the syringe before releasing the blood into the tube. Allow the blood to coagulate at 20°C–25°C for 30 min or at 4°C for 1–2 h.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1850-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Processing of blood samples to collect serum\n(A) The withdrawn blood is collected in 1.5 mL tubes and incubated at room temperature for 30 min to allow coagulation.\n(B) After centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 20 min, the serum (top layer) is transferred to a new tube and immediately frozen at −80°C.\nObserve for the absence of cardiac or respiratory cycles and perform a second physical method of euthanasia (e.g., cervical dislocation).\nCritical: Depending on the number of mice and staff support, it may take a long time to perform the cardiac puncture on all the animals. Ensure as best as possible that all blood samples are incubated for the same amount of time. If needed, you can centrifuge and collect the serum in batches.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 1,000 × g for 20 min.",
    "Transfer supernatant (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B) to clean tubes and immediately freeze at −80°C until ready to perform the cytokine analysis. Ideally, each sample should be aliquoted in smaller volumes to avoid multiple freeze/thaw cycles.\nNote: If the blood is maintained and processed at 4°C or the withdrawal was performed too fast, it is possible to observe hemolysis (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). To avoid this, perform all the steps at 20°C–25°C, but freeze the serum immediately after centrifugation.\nProceed to lung and spleen harvesting and CFU plating immediately.\nHarvest of lungs and spleens and CFU assay – Day 1 and 14\nTiming: ∼8 h\nIn this step, we collect the lungs and spleens from the Mtb-infected mice and homogenize them for CFU plating.\nNote: We perform organ harvesting and CFU plating from the 24 h cohort of mice on day 1 post infection and all remaining mice on day 14. The steps are the same.\nNote: Prepare the GentleMacs and 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes at the same time you prepare the tubes for cardiac puncture. Organs will need to be collected immediately following the cardiac puncture.\nCritical: Mouse work, organ homogenization, and CFU plating are done in a biological safety cabinet to maintain sterility and prevent contamination. All the tubes and reagents must be sterile and handled aseptically.\nPrepare (n = number of mice) GentleMacs M tubes with 2 mL of PBS-Tween to collect the lungs.\nPrepare (n = number of mice) empty 1.5 mL tubes to collect the spleens.\nSpray your scissors and forceps with 70% ethanol before use and between each mouse.\nUsing a sharp pair of scissors, remove the skin from the abdomen to chest.\nCarefully cut open the peritoneum and collect the spleen.\nCritical: Be careful not to damage the intestines to reduce the risk of microbial contamination.",
    "Using forceps and scissors, open the diaphragm, carefully cut the trachea and remove the lungs.\nOnce the organs are collected, proceed with their processing and homogenization.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1850-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Homogenization of lungs and spleens for CFU assay\n(A–C) Collect the spleen into a tube (A), weigh it, add 500 μL PBS-Tween and begin homogenizing with a sterile pestle (B) until you obtain a uniform homogenate (C).\n(D–F) Collect the lungs into a GentleMacs M tube with 2 mL PBS-Tween (D), homogenize with the GentleMacs dissociator (E) to obtain a uniform homogenate (F).\nSpleens:\nCollect the spleen inside a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nMeasure the weight of each spleen using an identical empty Eppendorf tube to tare the scale.\nNote: Considering the small size of mouse spleens, a precision scale is recommended in order to be more accurate in the evaluation of differences amongst the samples.\nAdd 500 μL of PBS-Tween to each of the tubes containing the spleens.\nHomogenize spleens using sterile pestles (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B) until you obtain a uniform homogenate (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).\nNote: If the spleen is very large, more PBS-Tween (i.e., 1 mL) and a larger tube might be required.\nLungs:\nPlace each lung sample (lobes not separated) in a GentleMacs M tube containing 2 mL PBS-Tween (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D).\nRun the appropriate GentleMacs protocol to homogenize the lungs (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]E). In our experiments, we used the “RNA_01” protocol and ran the protocol twice, to obtain a uniform homogenate (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]F).\nOnce the organs are homogenized, prepare 1.5 mL tubes with 900 μL PBS-Tween for the serial dilutions to inoculate for CFU assay (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1850_7.csv\nThe green checkmarks identify the serial dilutions that we usually seed in 7H10 plates when 107–108 CFU are i.v. injected in each mouse. d.p.i.: days post infection.",
    "Prepare serial dilutions by transferring 100 μL of homogenate into the tubes containing 900 μL PBS-Tween.\nPlate 100 μL of the appropriate dilution on to 7H10 agar plates (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1], green checkmarks).\nNote: The number of serial dilutions to prepare depends mainly on the injected CFU, the time post-infection of organ harvesting and the expected therapeutic effect of your tested drugs. See Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for more details about the serial dilutions that we usually prepare for our experimental conditions. See also expected outcomes for more details about the in vivo clearance of Mtb mc26206.\nIncubate plate at 37°C for 2–3 weeks until colonies are visible.\nCount the colonies and calculate the CFU (per organ) by multiplying the colony number by the plated serial dilution and the total volume of the organ homogenate.\nNote: In our experience, the volume of the lungs does not significantly vary among the cohorts of Mtb mc26206 infected mice. In contrast, the size of spleens can significantly change between the cohorts, affecting the final volume of the spleen homogenate. Therefore, for a more accurate calculation of the CFU/spleen, precisely measure the final volume of the homogenate or use the spleen weight to approximate the final volume (i.e., 500 μL of PBS-Tween + spleen weight). Whatever methods you use, be consistent for all the samples.\nCytokine and chemokine profiling assay\nTiming: 6 h (assay preparation and protocol), 2 h (data acquisition), 2–3 h (data analysis)\nNote: The preparation steps, the assay protocol, and the data acquisition by flow cytometry should be performed in the same day. The data analysis can be performed any time after the data acquisition.",
    "In this step, we analyze the cytokine and chemokine profiles of the mice using the collected serum. We used the bead-based multiplex immunoassay LEGENDplex, from BioLegend. More specifically, we perform the mouse serum analysis using the predefined Mouse Inflammation Panel (13-plex) with V-bottom plates. Here below we briefly describe the protocol as we applied it. For more details, please see manufacturer’s manual[href=https://www.biolegend.com/Files/Images/media_assets/pro_detail/datasheets/76100_Mouse_Inflammation_Panel_V05.pdf].\nNote: Many different multiplex or ELISA kits can be used to evaluate the serum concentration of cytokines and chemokines of interest. The choice for the appropriate analysis should be based on the expected response of the in vivo experiments. In our case, we opted for a panel of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines to evaluate the inflammatory response induced by (1) Mtb infection, (2) drug treatments and (3) the combination of the two stimuli.\nRead the manual carefully.\nWe suggest setting up the flow cytometer accordingly before beginning the experiment. This will allow for proper reading of the samples after completing the protocol without any delay. To access the setup instructions, visit: www.biolegend.com/legendplex[href=http://www.biolegend.com/legendplex] and click on the Instrument Setup tab to select the instructions for the specific flow cytometer that will be used.\nPrepare the reagents as described in the manual. The main components that must be prepared or processed before starting the experiment are the following: the Mouse Inflammation Panel Premixed Beads, the wash buffer and the Matrix C.\nPrepare the standards by reconstituting the lyophilized Mouse Inflammation Panel Standard Cocktail as described in the manual.\nNote: The top standard concentrations of analytes in this panel are set at various concentrations but may be subject to change from lot to lot. Refer to the lot-specific Certificate of Analysis for this information (provided along with the kit or downloadable from the BioLegend website).",
    "Thaw the serum vials on ice and centrifuge at 8,000 × g for 2 min at 4°C to remove any particulates.\nNote: According to the manufacturer, the serum samples should be diluted 1:2 to ensure accuracy and avoid clogging of the filter paper. Since we do not use the filter paper option (V-bottom plates instead) and the analytes in our samples are mainly in lower concentration ranges, we do not dilute our samples.\nAllow all reagents to warm to 20°C–25°C before use.\nKeep the plate upright during the entire assay procedure to avoid losing beads and keep the pate wrapped with aluminum foil for all the incubation steps.\nStandards and samples should be run and loaded in the plate as recommended to facilitate the following data analysis.\nIn the standard wells, combine 25 μL of Matrix C and 25 μL of each standard. In the sample wells, combine 25 μL of Assay Buffer and 25 μL of mouse serum.\nVortex the mixed beads for 30 s and add 25 μL of mixed beads to each well (final volume 75 μL per each well). Be sure to mix the beads regularly during this step to avoid bead settling.\nSeal the plate, cover it with aluminum foil and shake it at 800 rpm on a plate shaker for 2 h at 20°C–25°C.\nCentrifuge the plate at 1050 rpm (∼250 × g) for 5 min.\nImmediately after centrifugation, remove the supernatant either by pipetting with a multichannel pipette or by dumping it in the sink by plate inversion.\nNote: Since we experienced some bead loss with the inversion method, we opted for pipetting the supernatant instead.",
    "Wash the plate once with 200 μL of wash buffer into each well and shake the plate at 800 rpm for 1 min. Repeat steps 57 and 58.\nAdd 25 μL Detection Antibodies to each well.\nSeal the plate, cover it with aluminum foil and shake it at 800 rpm on a plate shaker for 1 h at 20°C–25°C.\nAt the end of the incubation, add 25 μL of SA-PE to each well directly, without washing the plate.\nSeal the plate, cover it with aluminum foil and shake it at 800 rpm on a plate shaker for 30 min at 20°C–25°C.\nRepeat steps 57 and 58.\nAdd 150 μL of 1× Wash Buffer to each well. Resuspend the beads by pipetting and read the samples on a flow cytometer. We used a Beckman Coulter CytoFLEX, transferring the samples in a flat-bottom 96 well plates and reading directly using the autosampler.\nNote: Despite the instrument being set up to shake each well before analyzing the sample, we experienced instrument clogging. To minimize the problem, we analyze 2 columns at a time and resuspended the beads by pipetting often during the reading (pausing the cytometer). We also added a wash step for the flow cytometer with water every 16 samples.\nUsing the template previously setup following the Flow Cytometer Setup Guide, set the flow rate to low and set the number of beads to be acquired to about 300 per analyte (4000 beads for a 13-plex assay), creating a large gate to include both Beads A and Beads B (gate A+B).\nRead the samples following the recommendations in the manual.\nWhen all the samples are acquired, proceed with the data analysis using the BioLegend’s LEGENDplex™ data analysis software, provided with the kit."
