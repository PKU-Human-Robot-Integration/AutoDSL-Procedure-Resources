    "Approval or consent to perform this study was not required since the use of patients' data is not applicable. In this study, DICOM data from a maxillary model consisting of extracted, de-identified human teeth are used. Teeth were extracted due to reasons not related to this study.\n1. Virtual access cavity planning\nStart the digital planning program.\nRight-click on Expert to choose the advanced mode.\nRight-click on New to open a new case.\nSelect the folder with DICOM image data to import the image data to the software.\nAdjust the Hounsfield Units (HU) thresholds if necessary for optimal visualization (check in the small window in the lower left).\nClick on Create Dataset to complete the data import.\n\tNOTE: Here, DICOM data from a maxillary model consisting of extracted, de-identified human teeth are used.\nChoose the type of planning by left-clicking on Maxilla or Mandible and name the planning.\nClick on Edit Segmentations to start the image segmentation process.\n\tNOTE: A new window opens automatically for the segmentation process.\nChoose the axial view by left-clicking on Axial in the upper left box.\nClick on Density Measurement to measure the high radiopaque tooth surface and the surrounding non-radiopaque states (air). Calculate the mean values between both densities. (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: The mean value needs to be calculated manually; there is no integrated tool in the software.\nClick on 3D Reconstruction.\nSet the lower threshold to the determined mean value (Figure 2A).\nSegment the dentition with the Flood Fill Tool and name the segmentation as desired (Figure 2B).\n\tNOTE: When the flood fill tool is selected and active, the desired area can be segmented by a left click in the 3D-view.\nComplete the segmentation by clicking on Close Module.\nAdd a model scan by selecting Add > Object > Model Scan.",
    "NOTE: A surface scan needs to be generated beforehand (e.g., utilizing an intra-oral scanner, which provides the data as an stl-file).\nImport the stl File from the digital surface scan.\nChoose Align to Other Object.\nSelect the performed segmentation (Figure 2C).\nChoose three different matching points for landmark registration in the 3D view in both datasets, the segmentation, and the surface scan.\n\tNOTE: Spatial distribution of the points will facilitate the semi-automatic matching of the data.\nVerify correct registration in all planes and complete registration.\n\tNOTE: Manual corrections can be required if deviations between CBCT and surface scan are apparent. If required, left-click and drag to adjust the alignment spatially, and right-click and drag to adjust angular deviation in the displayed planes (Figure 3)\nAdd an implant (the utilized endodontic bur must be imported to the software's implant database beforehand) to plan the access to the root canal.\nPosition the bur in the desired angulation and to the required depth, and verify in all planes (Figure 4A).\nAdd the corresponding sleeve to the bur (the utilized sleeve system must be added to the database beforehand via Extras > Edit Custom Sleeve System).\n\tNOTE: The sleeve must not be in contact with the crown of the tooth. If the sleeve is in contact, a longer bur needs to be selected to provide space between the sleeve and tooth structure (Figure 4B).\nSelect Object > Add > Surgical Guide to design the template as preferred (Figure 5A).\nExport the template as an stl file and manufacture it with a 3D printer (Figure 5B, Supplementary File 1).",
    "​NOTE: After completing the 3D print, rework the template according to the manufacturer's instructions for the printer and printing material used. The accurate removal of support material is crucial for the fit of the template on the dental arch, and thus also for the accuracy of the preparation of the access cavity.\n2. Access cavity preparation\nCheck the fit of the template on the dentition (Figure 5C).\n\tNOTE: Inspection windows can be added during the design process to enhance visual control of the fit and seat.\nCheck the fit of the sleeve in the template.\nMark the enamel at the access cavity site. Dye (e.g., caries detector) may be used at the bur's tip (Figure 6A, B).\nRemove the enamel at the access cavity site without using the template or endodontic bur. Use a diamond bur instead until dentin is exposed (Figure 6C).\nPlace the sleeve containing the template on the dental arch.\nInsert the bur into the handpiece that was used for the planning.\nPerform the access cavity preparation with template guidance (Figure 6D).\n\t​NOTE: The access cavity should be prepared intermittently. The drill and the cavity should be cleaned of debris to counteract heat generation. Hand files can be used to check if the root canal orifice can be entered before the apical position is reached. The apical position will be defined by the bur stop. Hand files can be used to search or enter the canal orifice. Once the canal orifice is located, conventional root canal treatment utilizing hand files and/or rotary instruments can be performed.\n3. Treatment evaluation\nUse the preoperative CBCT settings to create postoperative image data.\nStart a new case planning.\nImport the image data analog to the preoperative planning.\nClick on Edit Segmentations.",
    "Set the lower threshold to the determined mean value, which was calculated for the preoperative data.\nUse the Flood Fill Tool to segment the dentition.\nComplete the segmentation by clicking on Close Module.\nOpen the preoperative planning.\nSelect Plan > Treatment Evaluation.\nSelect Postoperative Volume Dataset (Figure 7A).\nLoad the correct postoperative dataset and choose the generated segmentation.\nAlign pre- and postoperative CBCT data by choosing three different regions for landmark registration.\n\tNOTE: Spatial distribution of the points will facilitate the semi-automatic matching of the data (Figure 7B).\nVerify correct registration in all planes and complete registration.\n\tNOTE: Manual corrections can be required if deviations between CBCT and surface scan are apparent (Figure 8).\nPlace the virtual endodontic bur in the direction of performed access cavity preparation, and check in all the planes (Figure 9).\n\tNOTE: If the diameter of the calcified canal is larger than the diameter of the utilized endodontic bur, adjustment in the apical-coronal direction is not feasible. Thus, treatment evaluation can be determined for angular and lateral deviation only, not for apical or three-dimensional deviation.\nSelect Finish, and the software will calculate the deviation automatically, showing the results in a table. Moreover, the deviation between planned and performed access cavity preparation can be visualized in a 3D-rendered view.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
