    "1. Microbubble stock preparation\nIn 10 mls of PBS mix 200 mg 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine and 50 mg 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine with 1 g glucose.\nHeat the mixture in boiling water bath 20-30 minutes, pipette mixing every 5 minutes. \nThe solution can be stored at 4°C for up to 6 months.\n2. Microbubble Preparation\nTake a 250 μl of the prepared microbubble stock solution and incubate at 40°C for 15 minutes.  \nThe pre-warmed microbubble solution is then transferred to a 1.5 mL microtube containing 50 μl of glycerol. \n1-2 mg of purified plasmid DNA encoding an expression construct for the gene of interest (purified in this example by Qiagen Endotoxin free MegaPrep kit, Qiagen, Germantown, MD, with a optimal concentration of 4mg/ml).  2.4) Phosphate-buffered saline is added to a final volume of 500 μl.  Endotoxin free Qiagen maxipreps are used, as well as sterile PBS in order to ensure sterility.\nThe air in the microtube is then replaced with Octafluoropropane gas. \nThe microtube is then shaken vigorously in a dental amalgamator for 20 seconds.  \nThe subnatant containing residual DNA and buffer that has not bound to the microbubbles is then carefully removed and the microbubble layer is washed three times with sterile PBS to remove unattached DNA, and placed on ice between each wash cycle.  We typically achieve a binding efficiency of 30-40%.  All reagents are sterile and care is made to minimize contamination.\nThe plasmid DNA-bound microbubbles are then placed on ice for up to two hours until use.\nThe subnatant removed from the microtube after mixing and the PBS washes, can be used to determine the concentration of unbound DNA, and likewise the amount  bound based upon the known initial concentration, by measuring the optical density of this solution at a wavelength of 260nm using a spectrophotometer. \n3. Equipment Calibration",
    "Prior to first use, a 1 MHz cavitation transducer needs to be calibrated to ensure proper mechanical index and pulse repetition.  A submergible 1 MHz, 13mm, unfocused transducer is connected to a 20 MHz Function/Arbitrary Waveform Generator through a power amplifier.\nThe transducer is placed in a plastic container full of water, aimed directly at a hydrophone, which has been connected to a 500 MHz oscilloscope via a charge amplifier. \nWaveform, frequency, amplitude, burst cycle, and power amplification can all be modified to obtain the proper duty cycle and mechanical index optimal to cavitate the microbubbles.  For this particular experiment, we have calibrated the system to a mechanical index equivalent to ~1.3 at 1 MHz.  \n4. Microbubble Delivery & UTMD\nPrior to microbubble delivery and UTMD, C57BL/6 mice were anesthetized with 100mg/kg ketamine and 5mg/kg xylazine through IP injection.\nMicrobubble delivery was administered intravenously through a direct injection into the left ventricle of the heart or through tail vein catheterization.  For the direct cardiac injection, a volume up to 100 μl of the plasmid DNA-loaded microbubble solution is injected through a 30 gauge needle inserted at the anterior 4th intercostal space under ultrasonic visualization into the left ventricle of the heart.  \nThe microbubble solution bolus resulting from the left interventricular injection is visualized using Visual Sonics’ 38 MHz high frequency ultrasound transducer placed in a stationary position on the thorax of the mouse in a long-axis view using VisualSonics’ Vevo 2100 Imaging System. All syringes and needles are sterile, insuring the most sterile environment possible for these injections.",
    "Immediately following the injection, microbubble destruction is carried out for ~5 minutes using a second, smaller sized low frequency 1.0 MHz transducer held directly over the desired organ, targeting destruction to this region.   In this example, the ultrasound was administered to the liver at a pulse repetition frequency of 1.0 MHz, with a mechanical index equivalent to approximately 1.3-1.5, and pulse repetition period of 100 ms for every 20 cycles.  Alternatively, the pulse can be gated to the ECG of the mouse (not shown in this experiment) to a burst of 3 frames of ultrasound, every 4-6 cardiac cycles. We obtain greater efficiency of transfection with protocols that allow the capillary bed to refill with bubbles between bursts of ultrasound. \n5. Alternative Delivery Method\nWe chose to highlight the interventricular injection due to the complexity of the procedure, but in many instances, such as prolonged infusion of microbubbles, a tail vein injection is the preferred method.  For the tail-vein method of microbubble delivery, the mouse is anesthetized the same way.  A syringe containing the plasmid DNA-bound microbubbles is connected to a 27 gauge needle/tail vein catheter. The tail vein catheter is inserted into the distal third of either the right or left lateral veins that along the tail of the mouse.  The syringe containing the microbubbles is placed in an infusion pump that automatically administers a uniform preset volume of solution over a preset period of time.  We typically infuse 200-300μl at a rate of 3ml/hour.\nAnimal use",
    "All animals were handled in accordance with good animal practice as defined by the relevant national and/or local animal welfare bodies, and all animal work was approved by the appropriate committee (University of Hawaii Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, approval number 07-100-3).  Appropriate anesthesia (ketamine/ zylazine) was used and analgesics (Bupivicaine and Buprenorphine) were available, though not required.\n6. Representative Results: \nThe effectiveness of the UTMD-mediated plasmid DNA delivery can be evaluated through a variety of methods depending \nupon the genes encoded in the construct, such as, but not limited to; luciferase in vivo imaging, B-gal ex vivo staining, and/or immunohistology. \nIn particular, in vivo bioluminescence imaging allows one to monitor the presence and duration of gene expression serially in mice transfected\nwith a plasmid encoding a bioluminescent reporter gene (luciferase).  The Xenogen In Vivo Imaging System (IVIS) (Caliper Life Sciences, \nHopkinton, MA) is used for bioluminescent imaging.  Images are typically taken of all mice the first day after UTMD mediated transfection and \nis repeated every three to four days until bioluminescent gene expression is no longer visually detectable through the system (Figure 1).  \nTo prepare mice for bioluminescent imaging, mice first receive an IP injection of the luciferase reporter probe D-luciferin (Caliper Life \nSciences) and are then anesthetized ~3 minutes later.  Biodistribution of the D-luciferin substrate is allowed to proceed for ~10 minutes \nbefore the animal is placed in the IVIS imaging chamber and a full body image scan is taken. During the acquisition, the photons emitted \nfrom the firefly luciferase/D-luciferin photochemical reaction are measured.  Figure 1 also illustrates similar IVIS bioluminescent imaging \nof the liver following UTMD, and Figure 2 is an epifluorescence (100X) image of the transfected liver using an anti-luciferase primary",
    "antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) and AlexFluor-568 conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen).  It is clear to see that the UTMD mediated liver \ntransfection has affected not only the endothelial cells, but the hepatocyes as well.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2963/2963fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.
