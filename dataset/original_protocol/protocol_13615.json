    "All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Guangdong Laboratory Animals Monitoring Institute (approval no. IACUC2017009). All animal experiments were performed following the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8th Ed., 2011, The National Academies, USA). The animals were housed in an AAALAC-accredited facility at the Guangdong Laboratory Animals Monitoring Institute (license no. SYXK (YUE) 2016-0122, China). Six male Tibetan minipigs (n = 3 each for the sham group and DAC group, 25-30 kg in weight) were used to develop the HFpEF model.\n1. Animal and instrument preparation\nAcclimate the animals to the facility for 14 days before surgery.\nPerform health examinations, including biochemical tests and echocardiography, before the surgery. Exclude the animals with cardiac abnormalities in structure (ventricular dilation or hypertrophy) and function (EF <50%) according to the T/CALAS85-2020 Laboratory animals - Guidelines for the health assessment of major organs, such as the heart, liver, kidney, and brain of large laboratory animals (Chinese Association for Laboratory Animal Sciences, China).\nFast the animals for more than 12 h before anesthesia by not feeding on the day of the surgery.\nPrepare the surgical room and devices (Figure 2). Check aesthesia ventilator station, veterinary and patient monitors, veterinary ultrasound system, aspirator, and other surgical devices. Autoclave the scissors, forceps, retractors, scalpel handles, aspirator head, surgical needles, etc. (see Table of Materials).\n2. Sedation, tracheal intubation, and vein cannulation\nWeigh the animals and calculate the anesthetic drugs. Sedate the minipigs with 1 mg/kg of zoletil injection (tiletamine and zolazepam for injection) and 0.5 mg/kg of xylazine hydrochloride injection (see Table of Materials).\nRestrain and place the minipigs in the right lateral recumbent position on the operating surgery table. Turn on the heating system to maintain the body temperature of the animals.",
    "Perform the echocardiography (step 5) and collect 2 mL of blood samples.\nIntubate the minipigs with an endotracheal tube connected to a veterinary anesthesia ventilator station (Figure 3A) (see Table of Materials).\nInitiate the ventilation at an 8 mL/kg of tidal volume and 30 breaths/min. Maintain the animals with 1.5%-2.5% of isoflurane during the surgical procedure.\nEstablish intravenous cannulation using a peripheral intravenous catheter (26 G) (see Table of Materials) from an ear vein (usually the marginal ear vein, Figure 3B).\nConnect the animal to a veterinary monitor.\n3. Surgical procedure\nShave the left thoracic area. Apply 0.7% of iodine and 75% alcohol to aseptically prepare the skin from the scapula to the diaphragm (Figure 3C).\nPlace sterile drapes over the surgical area.\nAdminister propofol (5 mg/kg) (see Table of Materials) by intravenous injection to maintain general anesthesia.\nMark the incision (~15 cm long) along the 4th intercostal space prior to skin incision with electrocautery.\nOpen the chest using a combination of cautery and blunt dissection of the muscle and connective tissue. Use an aspirator to remove blood during the operation.\nUse a rib retractor to spread the ribs (Figure 3D).\nLocate the thoracic descending aorta segment and determine the constriction site (Figure 3E). Use two 3-0 surgical sutures to loop around the segment twice (Figure 3F). Place three layers of medical gauze between the suture and the aorta to avoid tissue damage by sutures.\nSet up pressure measurement units to determine the degree of constriction (Figure 3F-H).\n\tNOTE: The unit includes a catheter that punctures the vessel wall, connection tube, pressure transducer, and a patient monitor.\nTighten the surgical suture surrounding the descending aorta segment gradually to achieve the desired constriction degree. Allow the pressure readings to stabilize for 20 min and permanently tighten the surgical knots.",
    "Use a drainage chest tube to evacuate the air and excess fluids in the chest cavity.\nClose the chest wall in layers, reapproximate the ribs and divided muscles with absorbable sutures.\nCheck for any bleeding and ensure good hemostasis.\nApply a bottle of benzylpenicillin (800,000 units) (see Table of Materials) to the operation area post-surgery.\nMonitor the presence of eye blinking and limb movement of the animal. Disconnect the ventilator but leave the endotracheal tube. Monitor the presence of spontaneous breathing.\nReturn the animal to its housing room and leave it to wake up automatically.\n4. Post-surgery care\nApply benzylpenicillin daily for 1 week (20,000 U/kg).\nApply 1 mg/kg of flunixin meglumine (see Table of Materials) daily for 1 week.\n\tNOTE: Opioid and NSAID analgesics should be administered intra- and post-operatively.\n5. Transthoracic echocardiography\nSedate the animal with 1 mg/kg of zoletil.\nPlace the animal in a mobile restraint unit with a canvas cover.\n\tNOTE: The mobile restraint unit (see Table of Materials) has four apertures designed to extend the forelimbs and hind limbs of the animal.\nShave the left chest of the animal.\nPlace fingers on the left-center of the chest to feel the apical pulse. Apply the ultrasonic gel to the surrounding area.\nPlace the ultrasound system's phased array transducer (3-8 Hz) in the third intercostal space. Move the transducer toward an anterior or posterior direction and adjust the notch angle.\nIdentify the atria, ventricles, and aorta. Record the B-mode and M-mode parasternal long-axis images.\n\tNOTE: The B-mode image represents the cross-section of the left ventricle at the papillary muscle level, and the M-mode image shows the movement of the left ventricle over time.",
    "Turn the transducer head 90° clockwise to obtain the parasternal short-axis view. Identify the left ventricle, right ventricle, and papillary muscle. Record the B-mode and M-mode images.\nUse the workstation provided by the manufacturer of the ultrasound system to assess the cardiac structure and function.\nSubscription Required.
