Repeat with the other hemisphere.\nPlace each hemisphere with the medial side facing up. Using curved forceps remove striatum, hippocampus and thalamus, leaving the cortex intact. Repeat with the other hemisphere.\nUsing a razor blade, mince cortex in small pieces and delicately transfer fragments using a sterile 3 mL plastic transfer pipette to a 12-well plate containing 1 mL of cold HBSS without calcium/magnesium.\nRepeat with next mouse.\nOnce dissections are complete, delicately transfer each pair of minced cortex submerged in cold HBSS (without calcium/magnesium) from the 12-well plate into a 15 mL conical tube placed on ice, using a 3 mL transfer pipette.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1236-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Place plate in a 37°C incubator at 5% CO2.\nNote: Each mouse cortex will yield 2 wells of a 6-well plate using this protocol. Elution volume may be increased to plate endothelial cells in additional wells. However, caution must be taken when doing this approach as endothelial cells in culture require to be at a high density to assure attachment when first plated following isolation. This cell isolation protocol results in a semi-pure endothelial cell culture. A pure endothelial cell population will be achieved within 48 h of culture (see steps 33–34).\nMaintenance of primary mouse cerebral cortex ECs\nTiming: 1 week\nEndothelial cells may require up to 7 days to reach confluency. However, growth rate will depend on initial endothelial cell plating density. Culture medium must be changed 48 h after isolation to remove non-adherent cells and replenish nutrients. After 48 h of culture a pure endothelial cell population is achieved.\nAliquot endothelial cell medium. A total of 2 mL is required per well. Let medium warm up at room temperature for 15 min.

Cells may be used for subsequent quality controls and experiments.\nSection 1': Purification of endothelial RNA from mouse cerebral cortex\nThe described cell isolation protocol in steps 1–32 yields a semi-pure population of ECs (purified passively through changes of culture medium). Indeed, after 48 h of culture, a pure EC population is reached (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). However, in order to perform the acute purification of endothelial RNA following EC isolation from mouse cerebral cortex, additional selection steps must be completed to ensure optimal purity of isolated ECs. Note that with the preparation below, a lower cell density is obtained compared to the isolation protocol described in steps 4–32.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1236-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.
