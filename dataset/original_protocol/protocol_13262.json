    "The collection of human samples was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Tianjin Medical University General Hospital. The collection of human venous blood strictly followed the guideline issued by the National Health Commission of China, namely WS/T 661-2020 Guideline for Collection of Venous Blood Specimens. Briefly, blood was collected from healthy individuals with informed consent from the anterior brachial area vein, and the samples were mixed using 3.2% sodium citrate anticoagulant in a ratio of 1:9. When only sodium citrate anticoagulant specimens were collected, the first collection vessel was discarded. The processing flow was initiated within 0.5 h of sample collection. Adult healthy subjects were recruited for sample collection after obtaining informed consent. Patient exclusion criteria were: (1) a recent intravascular thrombosis, (2) liver and kidney function impairment, (3) hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and other chronic diseases, (4) aspirin or anticoagulant treatment, (5) menstruation and pregnancy.\n1. Isolation of EV-rich plasma\nCentrifuge the samples at 120 x g for 20 min at room temperature to remove blood cells. The supernatant is platelet-rich plasma. Then, transfer the upper 1/2 of the supernatant to a new centrifuge tube with a pipette.\nCentrifuge the platelet-rich plasma at 1500 x g for 20 min at room temperature to remove the platelets. The supernatant is platelet-poor plasma. Then transfer the upper 1/2 of the supernatant to a new centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the platelet-poor plasma at 13000 x g for 2 min at room temperature to remove cell debris. The supernatant is EV-rich plasma. Then, transfer the upper 1/2 of the supernatant to a new centrifuge tube for subsequent testing.\n2. Detection of EV-ACT of the sample by the analyzer",
    "Turn on the clot analyzer (see Table of Materials) and preheat the instrument to 37 °C. Install the disposable probe and test cup, then start the quality control procedure of the machine.\n\tNOTE: When the viscous resistance signal value on the screen is displayed as a straight line, it means that the detection is not interfered with and the quality control of analyzer status is qualified. The testing procedure can be started after the self-test is qualified.\nEnter sample information into the system. Then, transfer 200 µL of EV-rich plasma to the test cup, followed by 20 mM 170 µL of calcium chloride. Click the start button. The magnetic stirring rod in the test cup will fully mix the sample and calcium chloride. Close the cover, and the probe will begin to detect the change in sample resistance.\n\t​NOTE: After the test is finished, the analyzer will automatically prompt \"test completed\". The time of EV-ACT is displayed and recorded by the system. The result is expressed in the unit of time \"second\". Discard the probe and test the cup.\n3. Flow cytometry-based quality control of the EV-rich plasma sample\nEVs were first identified by their size (0.1-1 µm). Adjust the parameters of the flow cytometer in advance and set the \"gate\" of EV using commercially available polystyrene beads (0.5, 0.9, and 3.0 µm) (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: The bead mixture consists of fluorescent spheres of different diameters covering the size range of microvesicles (0.5 and 0.9 µm) and platelets (0.9 µm and 3 µm).\nAdjust the voltage of the Forward Scatter and the Side Scatter, and ensure that the 0.9 µm microspheres fall in the appropriate region. The EV region can be drawn according to the diameter of the microsphere.",
    "Transfer 50 µL of EV-rich plasma into the flow tube, followed by 450 µL of filtered phosphate buffer saline.Thoroughly mix the liquid in the flow tube.Finally, detect the samples using flow cytometry25.\nUse Ultra Rainbow Fluorescent Particles (see Table of Materials) to quantify the number of EVs.In brief, add 10 µL of the particles to the sample before the flow detection, and calculate the EV concentration using the following formula after the sample detection is complete: 10,120 * EV (#) / (microbeads * volume) * dilution factor26.\nSubscription Required.
