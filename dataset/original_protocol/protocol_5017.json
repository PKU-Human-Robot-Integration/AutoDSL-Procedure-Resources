    "Fabrication of collagen type I/Matrigel hydrogels embedded with cancer-associated fibroblastsKeep all reagents on ice (collagen type I, Matrigel, growth medium, 5x collagen buffer and FBS).Aspirate the growth medium from the cells and wash the cells once briefly with PBS.Aspirate the PBS, and add trypsin-EDTA (0.25%) enough to just cover the cells. Once the cells have detached, resuspend them in normal growth medium and count the cells.Prepare the gels on ice. For a 1 ml volume of gel add in the following order:100 µl HN-CAFs (500,000 cells) – cell number will need to be optimized according to the cell line (see Notes). Use 100 µl growth medium for hydrogels without embedded cells.120 µl growth medium (cell line dependent, but typically DMEM, 10% FBS, insulin-transferrin-selenium, penicillin-streptomycin).100 µl FBS (100%).80 µl 5x collagen buffer (or according to the collagen amount) – vortex before aspirating.200 µl Matrigel (or according to the desired concentration, see Notes).400 µl collagen type I (or according to the desired concentration, see Notes).    Mix the collagen type I/Matrigel hydrogels very well by pipetting up and down without introducing air-bubbles. In case bubbles occur, centrifuge the hydrogel solution a few seconds at 200 x g.Transfer 1 ml collagen type I/Matrigel hydrogel to one well in a NuncTM Cell-Culture Treated Multidishes, 24-well plate. Avoid bubbles. In case bubbles occur aspirate the bubbles using a 100 µl pipette tip.Place the lid on the 24-well plate and transfer the plate to an incubator without adding growth medium.Let the gel polymerize for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.Add 1 ml growth medium and transfer the plate back to the incubator (washing step).Let the gel wash for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.Aspirate the growth medium without touching the gel.",
    "Add 1 ml fresh growth medium and transfer the plate to the incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2.Leave the cells to remodel their surrounding gel in the incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24-72 h (or until a measurement is desired). The media does not need to be replaced during the period when using the CAFs, however, it will depend on the specific cell type used.Measuring relative stiffness of cell-remodelled gelsRheological characterization was performed on all hydrogel samples using a TA Instruments DHR-2 controlled strain rotational rheometer using an 8 mm sand-blasted parallel plate geometry. Table 1 below outlines the testing parameters which we have determined to be optimal for the hydrogel setup described above using a Discovery Series Hybrid rheometer (TA Instruments).Table 1. Rheometer settingsimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170103/20170103003922_6638.jpgStart and calibrate the rheometer according to manufacturer instructions.Attach the stepped lower geometry to the peltier plate (Figure 1a).Attach the 8 mm diameter upper geometry (Figure 1a).Set the peltier temperature to required temperature (Table 1).Zero the axial force. Take the hydrogel out of the 24-well plate without damaging the gel using the stainless steel spatula (Figures 1b and 1c).Using an 8 mm disposable biopsy punch trim the gel to the correct size (Figures 1d and 1e).Carefully load the hydrogel into the stepped lower geometry (Figure 1f).Set a logarithmic oscillation strain sweep as per Table 1. Set a fixed angular frequency as per Table 1. Move the 8 mm upper geometry down until it just contacts the top surface of the gel (Figure 1g).Decrease the gap by small 50 microns increments to increase the axial force applied to the hydrogel (Figure 1h).Continue until a stable axial force of 0.03 N is reached as detailed in Table 1.Begin measurement.",
    "Analysis of the relative stiffnessEnsure a linear viscoelastic (storage modulus [G’]) response within the strain range evaluated (Figures 1i and 1j).Extract the storage modulus (G’) at 1% strain when comparing multiple gel measurements (Figures 1i and 1j). The elastic moduli (E) can be determined from the storage modulus (G’) using: E = 2 x G’ (1 + υ) Where, υ = Poisson’s ratio of 0.5 for hydrogels.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170103/20170103002223_3580.jpgFigure 1.

Lowering of the upper geometry (8 mm in diameter). h. Upper geometry in contact with the hydrogel. Applying axial force to the hydrogel until reaching a stable force of 0.03 N. i. Representative example of CAF-induced remodelling of collagen type I/Matrigel hydrogels. The storage modulus (G’) of collagen type I/Matrigel hydrogels is measured after 72 h of CAF remodelling. CAFs are still alive within the hydrogels upon measurement (see Notes). The storage modulus is measured over a decade of oscillation strain from 0.2% to 2%. The bar chart represents the storage modulus at 1% strain, and illustrates that increasing the number of CAFs induces stiffening of the hydrogel. j. Representative example of how CAF-induced remodelling of collagen type I/Matrigel hydrogels, and in turn stiffening can be blocked by perturbing the ROCK1/2 kinases (Rho-associated kinases1 and 2).",
    "The storage modulus (G’) of collagen type I/Matrigel hydrogels is measured after 72 h of CAF remodelling has taken place under the inhibition of ROCK1/2 kinases using 10 µM Y-27632. CAFs are still alive within the hydrogels upon measurement. The graph represents the storage modulus at 1% strain, and illustrates that ROCK1/2-inhibition prevents CAFs from remodelling and stiffening their environment."
