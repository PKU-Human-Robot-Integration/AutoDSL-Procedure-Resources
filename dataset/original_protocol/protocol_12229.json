    "Animals were housed in pathogen-free conditions. Mice were handled according to protocols approved by CCHMC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Cincinnati, OH USA). Mice utilized throughout these studies were maintained in a mixed background.\n1. Whole Mount X-galactosidase Staining\nEuthanize pregnant female at E11.5 to E14.5, by CO2 inhalation. Place animals in CO2 chamber, charge the chamber with CO2. Maintain animals in chamber for minimum of 5 min. Perform secondary method of euthanasia by cervical dislocation.\nClean abdominal area with ethanol (EtOH) 70% and perform laparotomy with a single abdominal midline incision. Utilize surgical scissors and standard pattern (straight serrate) forceps.\nIsolate uterine horns using forceps and fine scissors and immediately place tissue in petri dish containing chilled PBS solution. Maintain tissue on ice until proceeding to isolation of embryos.\nIsolate embryos from uterine horns. Dissect embryonic tracheal lung tissue using dissecting microscope. Utilize fine tip forceps and scissors to hold and puncture the uterine tissue and concepti releasing the embryos.\n\t\nRemove remaining embryonic membranes. With assistance of needle blades cut head of embryos and lower body part below the diaphragm. Locate liver as a landmark.\nAfter isolation of the thoracic region of the embryo, proceed to remove lateral sides of the body wall, spine and heart using needle blades. Take care while removing the heart to avoid injuring tracheal tissue. Finally, carefully, separate the esophagus from the trachea by pulling the esophagus with assistance of needle blades. Maintain tissue in PBS solution on ice.",
    "Place tissue in 4 ml screw cap vials using glass or transfer pipettes. Fix tracheal lung tissue in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 30 min. After fixation, rinse tissue with PBS.
