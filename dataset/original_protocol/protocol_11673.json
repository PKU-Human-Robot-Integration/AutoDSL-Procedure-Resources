    "1. Plant growth and rhizobia inoculation\nTo generate the required nodules, sow the soybean seeds of choice in the selected substrate in a growth chamber under controlled conditions.\n\tNOTE: In this protocol, seeds were sown in a 0.5 L plastic bottle filled with a mix of sand:vermiculite (1:1). The growth chamber was set with a day/night cycle temperature of 28 °C /20 °C, respectively, and a light/darkness photoperiod of 16 h/8 h, respectively. The photosynthetically active radiation intensity was 620 µmol·m−2·s−1.\nPrepare in advance liquid Yeast-Extract Mannitol (YEM)-medium (see the Table of Materials). Autoclave the medium.\nOn the same day of seed sowing, inoculate one flask containing 100 mL of YEM with the Bradyrhizobium elkanii U1302 strain. Incubate the flask at 28 °C on an orbital shaker at 100 rpm.\n\t\nLet the rhizobia grow for 2 days and inoculate the seedlings with 2 mL of the culture.\n2. Water deficit treatment (optional)\nNOTE: This protocol outlines the water deficit treatment of the soybean plants. This part can be changed or omitted entirely depending on the experimental question at hand.\nGrow the soybean seedlings for 19 days (V2-3 developmental stage) without water restriction. Keep the substrate at field capacity with B&D-medium17 supplemented with 0.5 mM KNO3.\nOn day 20, withdraw watering.\n\tNOTE: Here, the water content was measured daily by gravimetry (water gravimetric content) during the growth and water deficit periods.\nMeasure stomatal conductance in triplicate daily on the abaxial leaf surface with a porometer, as instructed by the manufacturer (see the Table of Materials), from day 20 until the end of the water deficit period.\n\t​NOTE: The end of the water deficit period was determined individually for each plant when the stomatal conductance value was approximately 50% of the one obtained on day 20 from sowing.\n3. Nodule harvest",
    "Collect liquid nitrogen in a clean container and label 15 mL tubes (one for each plant).\n\tCAUTION: Handle liquid nitrogen wearing cryo gloves, face shields, and safety goggles.\nRetrieve each plant individually. Cut and discard the aerial part. Thoroughly wash the root with water to remove any remaining substrate.\nDetach each nodule from the root and collect them in a prechilled 15 mL tube. Snap-freeze the tubes and store them at −80 °C.\n4. Preparation of cytosolic extracts\nNOTE: The final aim of this protocol is to obtain high-quality total RNA (TOTAL) and polysome-associated RNA (PAR). Therefore, work under conditions that prevent RNA degradation, always keeping the samples at 4 °C and using RNase-free laboratory equipment and solutions. Unless specified, all the solutions are prepared with sterile ultrapure water.\nPreparation of buffer stock solutions\n\t\nPrepare the autoclavable stock solutions listed in Table 1, autoclave them for 15 min, and keep at RT.\nPrepare the filter-sterilizable stock solutions listed in Table 1, filter-sterilize them, and keep them at −20 °C.\nPrepare polysome extraction buffer (PEB, see Table 1) and keep it on ice.\n\tNOTE: The volumes given are for six samples.\nCool the centrifuge to 4 °C and place 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes on ice.\nWeigh approximately 0.2 g of intact nodules in a weighing dish and transfer them to a precooled 2 mL tube.\n\tNOTE: Perform this step quickly to avoid the thawing of the samples. Alternatively, an estimated nodule volume of 0.4-0.5 mL can be used instead of the 0.2 g.\nAdd 1.2 mL of PEB, let the sample thaw for 2 min, and homogenize with a tissue grinder until complete disruption and homogenization of the nodules.",
    "NOTE: Be sure to grind the nodules once thawed as they will be soft enough to be easily disrupted with tissue grinders (see the Table of Materials) in microcentrifuge tubes. Frozen nodules are difficult to grind. Also, it is recommended to place the tubes in a benchtop cooler (0 °C) for proper homogenization while keeping samples cool.\nIncubate the samples on ice with gentle agitation for 10 min or until all samples have been processed.\nCentrifuge at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to pellet the debris. Recover the supernatant and repeat the centrifuge step.\nCarefully recover the clarified cytosolic extract and transfer a 200 µL aliquot to a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube for TOTAL isolation (TOTAL samples; see section 7).\n5. Preparation of sucrose cushions\nNOTE: This protocol uses a two-layer sucrose cushion (12% and 33.5%) in 13.2 mL ultracentrifuge tubes (see the Table of Materials). All solutions are prepared with sterile ultrapure water.\nPrepare the sucrose and salt stock solutions.\n\t\nPrepare 100 mL of 2 M sucrose solution (68.5%, Table 1).\nPrepare 10x salt solution (Table 1).\nPrepare the two layers of the sucrose cushion as described in Table 2. See Table 1 for the composition of the antibiotic (CHX and CHL) stock solutions.\n\tNOTE: The volumes given are for six cushions.\nPour 4.5 mL of the 33.5% sucrose layer into the centrifuge tubes. Then, add 4.5 mL of the 12% layer carefully and slowly with a P1000 micropipette. Put the tubes on ice until the addition of the clarified cytosolic extract.\n6. Polysome purification\nLoad 1 mL of the clarified cytosolic extract (step 4.8) on top of the sucrose cushion by carefully pipetting onto the sidewall of the tube.",
    "Transfer the ultracentrifuge tubes to precooled buckets and centrifuge at 217,874 × g (35,000 rpm in the referenced rotor [see the Table of Materials]) for 2 h at 4 °C.\nDiscard the remaining cytosolic extract and sucrose cushion, and resuspend the polysomal pellet with 200 µL of precooled RB (previously prepared according to Table 1).\nIncubate for 30 min on ice and then transfer the polysomal resuspension to 1.5 mL precooled tubes. Proceed with the RNA extraction (PAR samples).\n7. RNA extraction and quality control\nNOTE: This step is performed for TOTAL (step 4.8) and PAR samples (step 6.4).\nPrepare 75% EtOH with sterile ultrapure water and cool it to −20 °C. Additionally, cool chloroform and isopropanol to −20 °C.\nHomogenize the samples with 750 µL of the RNA isolation reagent and incubate for 5 min at RT.\nAdd 200 µL of cold chloroform and shake the tubes vigorously for 15 s. Incubate at RT for 10 min.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C for phase separation. Transfer 500 µL of the upper aqueous phase to a clean tube without disturbing the pink organic phase, and add 375 µL of cold isopropanol and 0.5 µL of RNase-free glycogen (see the Table of Materials). Mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down.\n\tNOTE: Glycogen is a carrier used as a co-precipitant to increase nucleic acid recovery from alcohol precipitation.\nIncubate the mix for 10 min at 4 °C and centrifuge at 12,000 × g for 15 min. Discard the supernatant.\nWash the RNA precipitate with 1 mL of cold 75% EtOH. Mix by brief vortexing.\n\tNOTE: At this point, the samples can be stored at −20 °C overnight.",
    "Centrifuge at 7,500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, carefully remove the supernatant with a micropipette, and air-dry the RNA pellet.\nDissolve the pellet in 50 µL of RNase-free water and incubate at 65 °C for 5 min.\nAssess the RNA concentration and integrity with highly sensitive capillary electrophoresis18 (see the Table of Materials) and/or electrophoresis on a 2% RNase-free agarose gel19 (see the Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: If the RNA samples are not going to be used immediately or are going to be sent to the sequencing facility for RNA-seq library preparation, it is recommended to use EtOH to precipitate them.\n8. RNA precipitation\nCool the centrifuge and EtOH to 4 °C.\nPrepare 3 M sodium acetate.\nPrepare 70% EtOH with sterile ultrapure water and cool it to −20 °C.\nEstimate the sample volume. Add 0.1 volumes of 3 M sodium acetate, 3 volumes of cold EtOH, and 0.5 µL of RNase-free glycogen. Mix thoroughly.\nLeave at −20 °C until needed.\n\t​NOTE: RNA precipitated samples can be stored for up to 1 year at −80 °C.\n9. Standard pipeline for gene expression analysis\nPerform an average of 40M Illumina paired-end reads, with read length >100 bp, for confident transcriptome and translatome data analysis.\n\tNOTE: Standard RNA-seq data analysis includes the following steps 9.2-9.5.\nCarry out read quality inspection using FastQC (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) or the multisample MultiQC20.\nRemove adaptor and low-quality sequences using either Trimmomatic21, BBDuk (http://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bb-tools/), cutadapt22, sickle23, or Trim Galore (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/), among others.\nIf a reference genome is available for the species, carry out read mapping against the reference, followed by abundance quantification, using Bowtie224, TopHat225 or Salmon26, and featureCounts27, besides other open source tools.\nPerform statistical analysis for differential expressed genes identification using edgeR28, DESeq229, or limma30, among others.",
