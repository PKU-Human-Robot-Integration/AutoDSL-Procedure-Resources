Anogenital distance measurement in female mice\nRecord each measurement for subsequent statistical analysis.\nNote: Anogenital distance measurement is a reliable metric tool to appreciate prenatal testosterone impregnation in humans (Barrett et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Dean and Sharpe, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) and in rodents (Mitchell et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nAssessment of hyperandrogenism via testosterone ELISA assay\nTiming: 4–5 h\nNote: The testosterone mouse Kit (Cat#DEV9911) is a solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), based on the principle of competitive binding (www.demeditec.com[href=http://www.demeditec.com]).\nMaterial needed for the next steps: ice, anti-coagulant collection tubes (Cat# 20901-757), 1.5 mL collection tubes (Cat#2150N), a refrigerated centrifuge (Cat#5175R), a microplate shaker (Cat#12620-928), a microplate absorbance reader (Spectramax).\nOptional: Microplate automated washer (Cat#8.1000).\nCollect mouse trunk blood between 10.00 a.m and 12.00 a.m from females in diestrous stage (when GnRH secretion into the portal circulation is low and therefore mean luteinizing hormone (LH) concentration is at basal levels) of each experimental group in 1.5 mL anti-coagulant collection tubes.\nCritical: Habituate animals to handling at least one week (preferably two weeks) before the experiments.\nSet the temperature of the centrifuge at 4°C before use.\nCentrifuge the blood samples for at least 15 min at 500–1000 gravitation force (g), pipette the plasma (upper phase) into a 1.5 mL collection tube and discard the remaining sample.\nImmediately store at −80°C until use.\nPrepare your plate (96 microplate).",
    "Start by diluting the wash solution (provided in the kit) by mixing 50 mL of 10× concentrated with 450 mL deionized water (ddH20).\nGradually thaw on ice the plasma samples previously stored at −80°C.\nAdd 10 μL of each Calibrator (0 ng/mL, 0.1 ng/mL, 0.4 ng/mL, 1.5 ng/mL, 6.0 ng/mL, 25 ng/mL) and sample in duplicates into appropriate wells.\nCritical: Steroid hormones are sensitive to temperature variations which could eventually lead to their degradation. Therefore, to ensure an accurate hormonal measurement always keep the samples on ice and pipette samples and reagents as quickly as possible.\nAdd 100 μL of Incubation Buffer into each well (provided in the kit).\nAdd 50 μL of Enzyme Conjugate into each well (provided in the kit).\nIncubate for 60 min at 18°C–25°C on a microplate orbital shaker (Cat#12620-928), at the speed of 320 rpm.\nDiscard the content of the wells and rinse the wells 4 times with 300 μL of Wash Solution (provided in the kit). Eliminate as much wash solution as possible by tapping your plate on absorbent lab paper to remove the residue.\nAdd 200 μL of substrate solution to each well (provided in the kit).\nIncubate for 30 min (use aluminum foil to protect the wells from light).\nAdd 50 μL of stop solution to each well.\nRead the plate within 15 min by measuring the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using a microplate absorbance reader (Spectramax).\nCritical: Each run must include its own standard curve as well as internal quality control to validate the reproducibility.\nCalculate the average absorbance values for calibrators, quality controls and samples.",
    "Using a semi logarithmic graph, build a standard curve by plotting the mean absorbance obtained from each standard against its concentration as following: plot absorbances values on the vertical (Y) axis and concentrations on the horizontal (X) axis.\nDetermine the corresponding concentration from the calibration curve.\nTo ensure reproducibility, always calculate the inter (between replicates) and intra (between runs) assays variations.\nNote: In this study, Intra-assay coefficient of variation for testosterone was 7% and inter-assay coefficient of variation was 11%.\nAlternatives: Calculated automatically using a 4 Parameter Logistics (4PL) curve fit.\nLuteinizing hormone ELISA assay\nTiming: 2 days\nNote: This protocol has been adapted from (Steyn et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]).\nFollow the same steps as detailed above (steps 4–7).\nCritical: Habituate animals to handling at least one week (preferably two weeks) before the experiments.\nPrepare your plate design and appropriate number the microplate wells to accommodate standards and samples in duplicates.\nCoat the 96 Well Clear Flat Bottom Polystyrene High Bind Microplate (Cat#9018) with 50 μL bovine LH-beta 51887 monoclonal antibody diluted at 1:1000 into each well at 4.00 p.m.\nIncubate at 4°C for 12–16 h.\nDecant the capture antibody and tap the plate on paper towel to remove the residue.\nWash each well with PBS-Tween (PBST).\nPipette 200 μL of blocking buffer per well.\nCover the plate with parafilm and incubate for 2 h on an orbital shaker (speed +/- 320 rpm) at 18°C–21°C.\nDiscard buffer and wash with PBST (200 μL per well) 4 times.\nGradually thaw on ice the plasma samples previously stored at −80°C.\nPrepare duplicates of the plasma samples in new Eppendorf tubes at 1:5 dilution as follows: for each duplicate, dilute 10 μL of plasma in 40 μL of PBST.",
    "Thaw the mLH stock solution (2500 ng/mL) and prepare the series of standards at the following concentrations: 25 ng/mL, 5 ng/mL, 2.5 ng/mL, 1 ng/mL, 0.5 ng/mL, 0.1 ng/mL, 0.05 ng/mL, 0.005 ng/mL and 0 ng/mL (PBST-BSA).\nNote: Standards should be loaded pure and at a dilution of 1:5; samples should only be loaded at a dilution of 1:5.\nPipette 25 μL of the standard or sample per well in duplicates.\nCover with parafilm and incubate for 2 h on orbital shaker at 18°C–21°C.\nWash with PBST 4 times (200 μL per well).\nAdd 50 μL of detection primary antibody in each well. Once covered with parafilm, incubate for 90 min on an orbital shaker at 18°C–21°C.\nDiscard the antibody solution from the wells and wash with PBST 4 times (200 μL per well).\nAdd 100 μL of TMB solution in each well. This time cover the plate with aluminum foil to protect it from light and incubate while shaking manually for 10 min.\nStop the reaction by adding 50 μL of HCl 3M in each well.\nRead the plate at 490 nm via a standard absorbance microplate reading (Spectramax).\nCalculate and interpolate the unknown values from the standard curve equation to obtain the LH concentrations.\nCalculate the inter (between replicates) and intra (between runs using a quality control) assays variations.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_895_2.csv\nPreparation of the solutions used in the LH ELISA assay (for a single 96 multiwell microplate)\nAssessment of estrous cyclicity and fertility\nAssessment of ovulatory cycle\nTiming: 14 days: ∼4–5 min per mouse\nBefore you start:\nThe following materials are required for this step: a glass slide (Cat# 18357-1), 0.09% saline solution (Cat#9888), a pipette and a bright field microscope (Leica ICC50).",
    "Note: On cytological evaluation, the four stages of the estrous cycle are defined by the absence, presence, or proportion of 4 basic cell types (epithelial cells, cornified cells, and leukocytes) as well as by the cell density and arrangement of the cells on the slide (Byers et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3], McLean et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). The full estrous cycle in mice, as well as in rats, occurs over 4–5 days.\nPerform vaginal smears for 14 consecutive days: gently insert a pipette tip filled with 10–20 μL of the saline solution into the vaginal orifice of the females (depth 1–2 mm maximum) and flush back and forward 2–3 times.\nPlace a small drop of the solution on a glass slide and spread it into a thin layer (cover slip not required for the observation).\nAnalyze cell morphology and proportion of cell types under a bright field microscope (Leica ICC50) using a 10× or 20× objective.\nIdentify the specific stage of the estrous cycle cell types as followed:\nProestrus: characterized by nucleated epithelial cells (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). These cells may appear in clusters or individually. This stage corresponds to the pre-ovulatory day, Estradiol (E2) increases, followed by luteinizing hormone (LH) and Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) surges, when ovulation occurs (McLean et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/895-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

With Leucocytes (circle), cornified epithelial cells (Black arrow), nucleated epithelial cells (Red arrow). Scale bar: 100 μm.\nEstrus: predominance of cornified epithelial cells (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). These cells are characterized by the absence of nucleus, a granular cytoplasm and an irregular shape (McLean et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nMetestrus: characterized by the presence of both of leukocytes and nucleated epithelial cells (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C) (McLean et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10])",
    "Diestrus: characterized by the presence of only leukocytes (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D). (McLean et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]) ∗ During estrus (ii), metestrus(iii) and diestrus (iv), circulating levels of LH and FSH remain low.\nCalculate the percentage of time spent in every cycle.\nCritical: For accurate analysis, monitor estrous cyclicity for at least two weeks.\nAssessment of reproductive competence\nTiming: 90 days\nEvaluate the reproductive competence of female offspring using a 90-days mating protocol as described below.\nPrepare a clean cage with water, food, bedding and nesting for each breeding pair.\nSelect unexperienced males (8–12 weeks old) and primiparous females (8–12 weeks old) from at least three different litters.\nPut one female and one male per cage as indicated: CNTR female with naïve males, PAMH females with naïve males. Use at least 3 breeding cages per group for a period of 3 months.\nDaily check each breeding cage and keep detailed records of the date of new litters and of the number of pups .\nRemove the pups from each new litter at P0 (right after parturition).\nDo not separate the breeding pair until the end of the fertility study.\nUsing the recorded data, evaluate the main 3 fertility parameters:\nNumber of pups/litter: average number of pups per litter of each experimental group over 90 days.\nFertility index: average number of litters per females over of each experimental group over 90 days.\nTime to first litter: number of days between the beginning of the breeding and the day of the first delivery.\nNote: A 90-day mating protocol is common practice in the field (Hoffmann, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) and it is advised to assess precisely reproductive competence.",
    "PAMH lineage obtained by breeding PAMH female offspring with control naïve males in a matriline breeding scheme show diminished fertility and fecundity for at least three generations, from F1 to F3, as indicated by fewer pups per litter produced over a 3-month period, by a significant delay in their first litter and by fewer litters produced during the 90 days mating protocol (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]) (Mimouni et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nHistological analysis of the ovaries\nTiming: 3–5 days\nCollect ovaries from 3-month-old females in diestrus and immediately fix them in 4% paraformaldehyde solution (PFA 4%, pH 7.4) in PBS at 4°C for 12–24 h.\nTransfer the ovaries to 70% ethanol.\nDehydrate the ovaries through a series of graded ethanol baths and include them in paraffin.\nSection the paraffin-embedded ovaries at a thickness of 5 μm, using a microtome (Leica RM2255).\nDeparaffinize your tissues with xylene and then rehydrate them in graded ethanol baths (100%, 90%, 80%, 70% and 50%) followed by rinses in distilled water.\nStain with hematoxylin-eosin (Sigma Aldrich; Cat#GHS132, Cat#HT1103128).",
    "Note: The mouse ovary is composed of : Corpora Lutea (CL): characterized by a central cavity, filled with blood and follicular fluid remnants or by prominent polyhedral to round luteal cells; Primordial follicles: characterized by an oocyte surrounded by a partial or complete layer of squamous granulosa cells; Primary follicles: have a single layer of cuboidal granulosa cells; Secondary follicles: possess more than one layer of granulosa cells with no visible antrum; Early antral follicles: are recognized if they often contain only one or two small antrum; Antral follicles: can be distinguished if they possess a single large antral space; Preovulatory follicles: are characterized by an oocyte surrounded by a rim of cumulus cells; Atretic follicles: a follicle is considered to be atretic if it displays 2 pyknotic nuclei or/and granulosa cells within the antral cavity, or/and uneven layers of granulosa cells (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nMeticulously examine the ovarian sections of CNTR and PAMH mice, during diestrous stage, corresponding to the same stage at which mean LH and T levels have been assessed.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/895-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Female mice prenatally exposed to excess AMH show diminished fertility and fecundity for at least three generations\n(A) Schematic illustration of matrilineal and control breeding scheme.",
    "(B) Fertility was assessed in control and PAMH lineage for 90 days. Fertility tests included the analysis of the number of pups per litter, the delay in days after pairing to give the first litter and the fertility index (number of litters produced per female during 90 days mating protocol). Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison post hoc test: Number of pups/litter, F3,17 = 23.90 ∗∗∗ p < 0.0001; Time to first litter, F3,17 = 9.774, ∗∗∗p = 0.0006; Analysis of fertility index between groups was assessed using Kruskal Wallis followed by Dunn's multiple comparisons post hoc test: ∗∗p = 0.0016. Data in B are represented as mean ± s.e.m. ∗ p < 0.05; ∗∗ p < 0.005; ∗∗∗p < 0.0005; ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001. Adapted with permission from (Tata et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19], Mimouni et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nCount the number of ovarian follicles and CL (Caldwell et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nCritical: Perform this step under the microscope using an ocular scale to classify follicles as a function of their diamater into preantral, large growing (200–400 μm) and cystic/atretic follicles (> 400 μm). To avoid repetitive counting, count CL every 100 μm."
