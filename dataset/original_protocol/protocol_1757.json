    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCharacterization of tracer\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThis step enables the measurement of the forward and reverse binding rates of the Tracer. These must be used later in the analysis of KICA data to determine the forward and reverse rates of competitor ligands.\nPrepare a concentration titration of BSP-590 in 100% DMSO in a white 384-well micromicroplate.\nNote: If the expected affinity of a new tracer is not known it is advisable to carry out an initial experiment to identify a suitable concentration range for the kinetic study. To remove the complexity of kinetics from this initial study, a single endpoint read is recommended at a time point where the experiment is likely at equilibrium. For instance, for the BRD4 KICA experiments, equilibrium binding was achieved for most concentrations by 60 min. When configuring kinetic experiments, using concentrations where binding to the target can be observed is advisable and will lead to greater accuracy in the measurement of rates. Tracer binding rates may be limited by solubility so make sure that higher concentrations are fully dissolved in the buffer before adding cells.\nNormalize DMSO volume across wells by ensuring the same concentration is present in each test well.\nApply 5 μL of tracer dilution buffer per well.\nApply 5 μL of OptiMEM per well and place on a microplate shaker for 15 min at 550 RPM, in the dark.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1346-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "(B) The microplateau values from (A) were normalized to a percentage of the microplateau (top concentration), and then plotted against the Tracer concentration and fitted with Equation (6)[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd6] to enable calculation of an equilibrium-derived KD,app value. Error bars are the SD calculated for the microplateau mean values.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1346_4.csv\nNote: The BRD4 KICA exemplar experiment (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]; Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) utilized a logarithmic 15-point titration of BSP-590 between 2000 and 5 nM, achieved using an HP D300 digital compound dispenser from a stock prepared in 100% DMSO. The amount of DMSO per well for this titration was then normalized using the same dispenser. The addition of tracer dilution buffer and OptiMEM are to aid the transfer of the titration into solution, which can be difficult, especially if pre-dispensed microplates have been stored at −20°C. If nanoliter dispensing is not available, a DMSO normalized serial dilution of tracer could be made up at 10× final concentration and added in 5 μL tracer dilution buffer. If the chosen tracer is easily solubilized then the extra addition of 5 μL OptiMEM can be removed and the tracer instead solubilized in a 10 μL 0.5× tracer dilution buffer.\nWash pre-transfected HEK293 cells with PBS, apply 0.5 mL of Trypsin solution per well and incubate for 4 min.\nSuspend and combine the cells by adding 2 mL of supplemented DMEM per well.\nTransfer cells to a 50 mL falcon tube and spin the cells at 125 g for 5 min in a centrifuge.\nResuspend the resulting cell pellet in an equivalent volume of OptiMEM (2.5 mL per well of the 6 well microplate in which cells were transfected).\nCount the cells and adjust the concentration to 2.5 × 105 cells/mL.",
    "Add NanoGlo Substrate (Furimizine) to the cells at a 1 in 500 final concentration, then mix by inversion and incubate for 2 min.\nNote: NanoGlo substrate was used at a final concentration of 1 in 500 (7.7 μM). This will need to be optimized for the plate reading length and final assay configuration used. In the case of the BRD4 KICA method, a 1 in 500 dilution of NanoGlo substrate gave a stable luminescence signal for at least 2 h of continuous reading. Higher concentrations of substrate may lead to a ‘flash’ effect in which a brighter but shorter luciferase signal is observed. Changes in luminescence signal should not lead to differences in the BRET signal as this is a ratiometric output, however low luminescence counts often lead to higher error in the BRET readings.\nSeed 40 μL of the cell suspension to each well of the pre-prepared white 384-well microplate containing the BSP-590 titration and quickly initiate repetitive readings of luminescence and fluorescence for at least one hour using a microplate reader equipped with 450 ± 20 nm bandpass and 610 nm longpass filters.\nCritical: It is important to quickly begin reads after the addition of cells to the BSP-590, however, unless a reader equipped with injectors is used, this is unlikely to be instantaneous. In instances where there is a gap between the addition of cells and the first read, measure the exact time and add this to the first reading time later during analysis.\nNote: The time taken for the tracer to reach equilibrium will vary according to the tracer and target used. It is advisable to use a sufficiently long read time in the first instance until the time to reach equilibrium has been defined.\nKICA\nTiming: 3–4 h",
    "Carrying out a KICA experiment enables the measurement of forward and reverse binding rates (kforward and kreverse, respectively) of unlabeled test compounds through perturbations in the binding of the tracer to the target.\nPrepare a concentration titration of competitor compounds in a 384-well white microplate in 100% DMSO and normalize total DMSO volume across wells.\nNote: It is advisable to include control columns of fully inhibited (for example, 7 μM JQ1) and uninhibited (DMSO alone) tracer binding on each test microplate. These control populations can be used to generate signal to background ratios (S/B) and z’ values to ensure assay quality is maintained over time.\nApply 5 μL of tracer dilution buffer per well containing 1.5 μM BSP-590 (10× the previously determined KD, app).\nNote: The concentration of BSP-590 used for this experiment (150 nM) was selected as it was approximately the concentration equivalent to the cellular KD, app measured in the tracer characterization experiments. Utilization of a concentration of tracer equivalent to the KD, app of the macromolecule of interest is advisable to avoid excessive target saturation, while still enabling a usable assay signal.\nAdd 5 μL of OptiMEM to each well and place the microplate on a shaker at 550 RPM for 15 min in the dark.\nWash pre-transfected HEK293 cells with PBS, apply 0.5 mL per well of Trypsin solution and incubate for 4 min.\nSuspend and combine the cells by adding 2 mL per well of supplemented DMEM.\nTransfer to a 50 mL falcon tube and spin the cells down at 125 g for 5 min in a centrifuge.\nResuspend the cell pellet in an equivalent volume of OptiMEM (2.5 mL per well of the 6 well microplate in which cells were transfected).\nCount the cells and adjust the concentration to 2.5 × 105 cells/mL.",
