    "Testis collection and single cell suspensionRemove testes from mice using sterilized forceps and scissors. Collect the testes in a 100 mm Petri dish containing 10 ml of ice-cold HBSS. Remove tunica albuginea from the testes to expose seminiferous tubules using sterilized forceps under a dissecting microscope (Figure 1A, upper panel). Transfer seminiferous tubule clumps to a new 100 mm Petri dish containing 10 ml of ice-cold HBSS. Keep the seminiferous tubules on ice.Wash seminiferous tubule clumps using ice-cold HBSS to remove debris and suspension cells.In order to estimate the rough volume of seminiferous tubule clumps, we transfer these clumps to a 2 ml polypropylene tube to calculate the volumes. Then, transfer seminiferous tubule clumps to a new Petri dish containing at least 3-fold seminiferous tubule clump volumes of room temperature collagenase solution, supplemented with 1 mg/ml type IV collagenase and 5 U/ml DNase I to remove interstitial Leydig cells, blood cells and peritubular myoid cells, and to digest genomic DNA from dead cells, respectively (see Note 1).Note: We normally collect 0.2-0.3 ml seminiferous tubule clumps from five one-week-old mice and add 1 ml collagenase solution, and obtain 1-1.5 ml seminiferous tubule clumps from five 4-week-old mice and add 6 ml collagenase solution. Loosen seminiferous tubules using forceps under a dissecting microscope within 20 min at room temperature (~25 °C) to avoid prolonged enzyme incubation (Figure 1A, lower panel).The procedures of testis collection, tunica albuginea removal and loosening of seminiferous tubules is demonstrated in Video 1.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Testis collection, tunica albuginea removal and loosening of seminiferous tubules from 4-week-old mice (steps A1-A5) Wash and clean the dispersed seminiferous tubules twice with at least 3-fold volumes of room temperature E-HBSS for 20 sec with gentle horizontal shaking at 30 rpm.",
    "Remove E-HBSS, add 3-fold volumes of collagenase solution and incubate at 37 °C for 20 min. Discard supernatant and wash dispersed seminiferous tubules by adding 3-fold volumes of room temperature E-HBSS for 20 sec with gentle horizontal shaking at 30 rpm.Repeat this wash process thoroughly five times with room temperature E-HBSS buffer for 20 sec with gentle horizontal shaking at 30 rpm to remove suspension cells.Transfer seminiferous tubules to a 2 ml polypropylene tube (or to 5 ml polypropylene tube when executing large number of samples). Add 5-fold volumes of room temperature trypsin solution supplemented with 5 U/ml DNase I. Pipette up and down using a P1000 pipette with cut tip to mechanically mince seminiferous tubules in order to obtain single cell suspension (Figure 1B). Incubate the tissues at 37 °C for 3 min.Note: It is important to execute this reaction (steps A10 and A11) within 10 min, since prolonged trypsin solution incubation may cause a proteolytic cleavage of the cell surface protein (see Note 2). Add 3-fold volumes of room temperature F-MACS to quench the trypsin reaction (see Note 3).Transfer suspension cells to a new 50 ml centrifuge tubes.Remove residual tissue and filter the suspension using a 70 µm nylon cell strainer. Wash cell strainer with 2-fold volumes of room temperature MACS buffer after adding cell suspension. Centrifuge cell suspension at 300 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Re-suspend cells in ice-cold MACS buffer and count the number of cells with a hemocytometer (see Note 4). Cell labeling and magnetic separation of one-week-old testicular cellsCentrifuge again at 300 x g for 10 min at 4 °C and aspirate supernatant. Re-suspend cells in 100 µl ice-cold MACS buffer and add 10 µl biotin-conjugated anti-CD90.2 (THY1) antibody per 107 cells isolated from one-week-old mice.",
    "We use approximately 5 µg antibody per 100 µl ice-cold MACS buffer.Mix well by gentle pipetting and incubate at 4 °C for 15 min with gentle rotation at 30 rpm (see Note 5). Wash by adding equal volume ice-cold MACS buffer to remove the unbound primary antibody.Centrifuge cell suspension at 300 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Re-suspend cells and wash again with 2 ml ice-cold MACS buffer per 107 cells and centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Aspirate supernatant completely and re-suspend cells in 80 µl MACS buffer and add 20 µl microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) per 107 cells.Mix well by gentle pipetting and incubate for 15 min at 4 °C with gentle rotation at 30 rpm.Wash by adding 2 ml MACS buffer per 107 cells and centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Aspirate supernatant completely and re-suspend up to 108 cells in 1 ml ice-cold MACS buffer.Pass testicular cells through a 35 µm nylon cell strainer to remove cell clumps. Approximate 10% cells are lost compared with the cell number after trypsin treatment (step A16). Place MS column on magnetic separator. Prepare MS column (Miltenyi Biotec) for cell separation by rinsing with 500 µl ice-cold MACS buffer.Apply cell suspension onto the prepared MS columns (see Note 6) and pipette gently every 30 sec to avoid sedimentation and aggregation of the cells before they pass through the column. This ensures the individual cells will pass through the column fluently and effectively.Collect the unbound cells that pass through and wash the column three times with 500 µl ice-cold MACS buffer. These cells can serve as a sample to test the efficiency of removing THY1+ cells from the subpopulation, or as a THY1-negative control group.",
    "Remove MS column from magnetic separator and place it over a new 15 ml centrifuge tube.Add 1 ml ice-cold MACS buffer into MS column in order to elute the THY1+ cells.Collect the magnetically labeled THY1+ cells by using the plunger supplied with the column (see Notes 5 and 7; Figures 1E-1M for germ cell purity and live/dead cell ratio). Cell labeling and magnetic separation of 4-week-old testicular cellsCentrifuge again at 300 x g for 10 min at 4 °C and aspirate supernatant. Re-suspend cells in 1 ml ice-cold MACS buffer and add 20 µl biotin-conjugated anti-CD90.2 (THY1) antibody per 108 cells isolated from 4-week-old mice. There is approximately 10 microgram antibody per 1 ml ice-cold MACS buffer.Mix well by gentle pipetting and incubate at 4 °C for 15 min with gentle rotation at 30 rpm (see Note 5).Wash by adding equal volume ice-cold MACS buffer and centrifuge cell suspension at 300 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Re-suspend cells and wash again with 2 ml ice-cold MACS buffer per 108 cells and centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Aspirate supernatant completely and re-suspend cells in 1 ml ice-cold MACS buffer and add 40 µl microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) per 108 cells.Mix well by gentle pipetting and incubate 15 min at 4 °C with gentle rotation at 30 rpm.Wash with 2 ml ice-cold MACS buffer per 108 cells and centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Aspirate supernatant completely and re-suspend up to 108 cells in 1 ml ice-cold MACS buffer. Pass cells through a 35 µm nylon cell strainer to remove cell clumps.Place LS column on magnetic separator. Prepare LS column (Miltenyi Biotec) by rinsing with 2 ml ice-cold MACS buffer.",
    "Apply cell suspension onto the prepared LS columns (see Note 6) and pipette gently every 30 sec to avoid sedimentation and aggregation of the cells before they pass through the column. This ensures the individual cells will pass through the column fluently and effectively.Collect unlabeled cells that pass through and wash the column three times with 2 ml ice-cold MACS buffer. These cells can serve as a sample to test the efficiency of removing THY1+ cells from the subpopulation, or as a THY1-negative control group.Remove LS column from the magnetic separator and place it over a new 15 ml centrifuge tube.Add 2 ml ice-cold MACS buffer into the LS column in order to elute the THY1+ cells.Collect the magnetically labeled THY1+ cells by using the plunger supplied with the column (see Notes 5 and 7; Figures 1E-1M for germ cell purity and live/dead cell ratio)"
