    "1. Slice Preparation\nCut brain slices using a vibrating microtome. We prepared 240 μm horizontal midbrain slices from an isoflurane-anethetized Sprague-Dawley rat (Charles River Laboratories) using a vibrating microtome (Microm HM 650V) in accordance with the University of Texas at San Antonio Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\nKeep the slices in an incubation chamber until you are ready to record. We use an incubation container heated to 32°C and filled with artificial cerebrospinal fluid  (aCSF; in mM): 126 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 4 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 dextrose, 25 NaHCO3, 1.3 ascorbic acid, 2.4 sodium pyruvate and 0.05 glutathione.\n2. Electrophysiological Recording\nTransfer the slice to the intracellular recording rig in which an artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) at 35°C is being perfused. We use the same aCSF as in 1.2 except that 2mM MgCl2 was used and glutathione was omitted. For horizontally prepared slices, we typically bisect the slice along the midline.\nVisualize the target neuron. We visualized individual substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons with a gradient contrast imaging system.\nPull an electrode using an electronic electrode puller. We pull electrodes with a tip resistance of 4-10 MΩ using a P97 Micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument Company).\nFill an electrode with the desired internal solution. We use a solution containing (in mM): 138 K-gluconate, 10 HEPES, 2 MgCl2, 0.2 EGTA, 0.0001 CaCl2, 4 Na-ATP, 0.4 Na-GTP. The internal solution was adjusted to a pH of 7.3 using 1M KOH and an osmolarity of 270-275 mOsms.\nMake a gigaohm seal onto the desired neuron. Rupture the seal with suction. This constitutes a whole cell recording. A Multiclamp 700B amplifier was used in our configuration. The amplifier should then be placed in the 'I=0' current clamp mode.\n3. Conductance Application with Dynamic Clamp",
    "RTXI (www.rtxi.org) was executed on the dynamic clamp computer. A custom written model containing an NMDA receptor was loaded into memory. The current to be injected into the cell in real-time is calculated by the following equation:\nINMDA = -gNMDA * [1/(1+([Mg]/3.57) * e(-Vm*0.062))] * (Vm - ENMDA)\nwhere gNMDA is the desired conductance  (in nS; by default set to 0 nS), [Mg] is the magnesium concentration (set to 1.5 mM in our example below), ENMDA is the reversal potential for the NMDA receptor (set to 0 mV), and Vm is the membrane potential of the cell measured from the amplifier (in millivolts).\nThe output from the dynamic clamp computer was connected to the Command input of the amplifier via an analog-to-digital converter.\nThe amplifier was placed in the 'IC' current clamp mode.\nEnter your desired NMDA receptor conductance into RTXI (e.g. 40nS). You should see a phasic burst of action potentials. Alternatively, a conductance can be given to RTXI via an analog output (Figure 1A, 'g(t)'). An appropriate scaling factor must be used within RTXI to convert the signal from volts to Siemens.\n4. Representative Results\nA successful setup for application of a conductance using the dynamic clamp is shown in Figure 1A. Using this setup, we made a whole cell somatic recording from a dopaminergic neuron in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Dopaminergic cells typically fire spontaneously at low rates with a pacemaker-like pattern. A burst of action potentials can be evoked by phasic application of a NMDA receptor conductance with dynamic clamp (Figure 1B).",
