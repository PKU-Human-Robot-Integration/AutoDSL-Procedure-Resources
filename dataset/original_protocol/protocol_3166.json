To maintain the in vivo translational status, it is necessary\n      to freeze the samples with liquid nitrogen, to conduct the lysis in the\n      presence of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide and under conditions\n      that inhibit the activity of RNases.\n    \n        Collect the Arabidopsis tissue maintaining the integrity of the roots\n        and shoots.\n      \n        Grind 200 mg of Arabidopsis tissue with liquid nitrogen and resuspend in\n        600 μL lysis buffer by vortex.\n      \nCritical: Do not use paper tissue to\n      remove excess media on the roots, which would compromise the integrity of\n      the roots and lower the amount and quality of the recovered ribosomes.\n    \nCritical: A successful lysate\n      preparation depends on the quality of grinding.\n    \n        Incubate the samples 20 min on ice and vortex twice during the\n        incubation for 5 s.\n      \nCentrifuge the samples at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.\n        Recover 500 μL of the soluble supernatant and transfer to a fresh\n        Eppendorf tube.\n      \nCritical: The lysates should be kept\n      on ice until the next step.\n    \nRNA digestion\nTiming: 45 min\n      Nuclease digestion is a critical step during the preparation of ribosome\n      footprints since both the stability of ribosomal RNA and the complete\n      conversion of polysomes to monosomes are very important for ribosome\n      profiling. The nuclease treatment step generates both ribosomal RNA\n      fragments and rRNA contaminating the samples, making the choice of an\n      appropriate RNase enzyme and control of the time for sample digestion\n      crucial. Improper digestion potentially compromises ribosomal integrity,\n      which may cause experimental bias and loss of information. Here, we chose\n      RNase I, which degrades single-stranded RNA to cyclic nucleotide\n      monophosphates, leaving a 5′-OH and 2'-, 3′-cyclic monophosphate.",
    "While RNase I is able to digest mRNA outside the ribosomes, the integrity\n      of the ribosomes is largely preserved.\n    \n        Add 12.5 μL of RNase I (100 U/μL) to the recovered 500 μL of lysate and\n        incubate for 45 min at room temperature with gentle mixing on a nutator.\n      \n        After the digestion, take 500 μL of lysate and add 16.66 μL of\n        SUPERase∗In RNase Inhibitor to stop the nuclease digestion.\n      \nSucrose density gradient fractionation\nTiming: 4 h\n      This step describes the separation of ribosomes from other cellular\n      components by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation.\n    \n        Transfer the digested lysate into a 13 × 56 mm polycarbonate\n        ultracentrifuge tube.\n      \nSlowly add 1.5 mL of 1 M sucrose cushion buffer.\nCritical: During the addition of the\n      sucrose cushion buffer, it is recommended to position the pipette tip\n      against the wall of the ultracentrifuge tube, carefully dropping the\n      sucrose solution to get two distinct layers in order to achieve\n      consistency between the replicates (the lysate will be located on top of\n      the sucrose).\n    \n        Centrifuge the samples in a TLA 100.4 rotor at 548,800 × g at 4°C\n        for 4 h to recover the ribosomes.\n      \nCritical: Precool the TLA 100.4 rotor\n      at 4°C in advance to prevent RNA degradation.\n    \nRNA footprint extraction\nTiming: 1 h 30 min\n    \nThis step describes the extraction of RNA footprints.\n        Remove the supernatant carefully. Locate the translucent ribosomal\n        pellet, but avoid to touch the bottom of the tube.\n      \nNote: Since the ribosomal pellet is\n      translucent and may be hard to detect, you can mark the location of the\n      pellet on the ultracentrifuge tube right after removing the tube from the\n      rotor.\n    \n        Resuspend the ribosomal pellet in 1 mL of TRIzol reagent in a 13 × 56 mm\n        polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tube.\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2936-Fig1.jpg\n              Figure 1.

Upper (34\n              nt) and lower (26 nt) markers are indicated in the gels.\n            \nNote: For RNA isolation, we followed the\n      TRIzol protocol from Invitrogen. We compared the yield and quality of the\n      isolated RNA using RNA extraction kits and TRIzol reagent and obtained the\n      best results with TRIzol (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and\n      2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\n    \n        Transfer the resuspended pellet to a fresh 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, add\n        0.2 mL of chloroform, shake the tube vigorously by hand for 15 s, and\n        incubate for 3 min at room temperature.\n      \nCentrifuge the sample at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.\n        Remove the aqueous phase of the sample very carefully. Avoid\n        contamination of the interphase or organic layer, and pipet the solution\n        into a fresh 1.5 mL tube.\n      \n        Add 0.5 mL of 100% isopropanol to the aqueous phase, vortex for 5 s,\n        incubate at −20°C for 30 min, and centrifuge at 12,000 × g for\n        10 min at 4°C.\n      \nRemove the supernatant, leaving only the RNA pellet in the tube.\nAdd 1 mL of 75% ethanol to the samples to wash the pellet.\nCritical: Prepare fresh ethanol with\n      RNase-free reagents. The percentage of ethanol should be 75%, a lower\n      percentage can lead to DNA contamination.",
    "Centrifuge the samples at 7,500 × g for 5 min at 4°C and discard\n        the ethanol.\n      \nNote: Remove the ethanol very well using a\n      pipet. Do not disturb the pellet.\n    \nAir dry the RNA pellet for 10 min at room temperature.\nResuspend the RNA pellet in 20 μL of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0).\nPause point: RNA can be stored\n      overnight at −20°C or for several months at −80°C.\n    \nFootprint fragment extraction\nTiming: 3 h 15 min – overnight\n    \n      This step describes the footprint fragment extraction, where the RNA\n      fragments of 30–34 nt length—corresponding to the ribosome-protected\n      fragments (RPFs)—were excised from a polyacrylamide gel.\n    \n        Pre-run a 15% polyacrylamide TBE-urea gel at 200 V for 15 min using 1 X\n        TBE running buffer.\n      \nCritical: It is advised to keep an\n      electrophoresis tank in the lab free of RNase contamination. If the tank\n      is used for other purposes, is necessary decontaminate the tank by soaking\n      it in 0.1 N sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and 0.1% EDTA in nuclease-free water\n      overnight, and then extensively rinse with nuclease-free water before use.\n      Alternatively, you can also use commercially available products such as\n      RNase ZAP (Ambion).\n    \n      Molecular biology grade water should be used to prepare the running buffer\n      due to the large volume of nuclease-free water needed for this purpose. We\n      suggest to prepare DEPC-treated water as follows: add 1 mL of DEPC\n      (diethylpyrocarbonate) to 1 L of MilliQ water, incubate for 12 h at 37°C,\n      and autoclave the DEPC-water for 15 min to degrade the DEPC. It is advised\n      to wear protective gloves, eye protection, and face protection when\n      manipulating DEPC.\n    \n        Just prior to the electrophoresis, add 10 μL of 2× denaturing sample\n        buffer to each RNA sample, and prepare the upper and lower markers by",
    "adding 1.0 μL of upper and lower markers (stock 10 μM), 8.0 μL of 10 mM\n        Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 10.0 μL of 2× denaturing sample buffer in a fresh\n        1.5 mL tube.\n      \n        Prepare a ladder sample with 0.5 μL of 10 bp ladder (1 μg/μL), 4.5 μL of\n        10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 5.0 μL of 2× denaturing samples buffer.\n      \nDenature the samples for 90 s at 80°C.\n        Load the samples on the polyacrylamide gel with control oligo sample\n        (mixed upper and lower markers) at both sides of the RNA samples.\n      \nCritical: It is very important to\n      clean the wells before loading the samples on the gel since urea may\n      compromise proper running of the samples.\n    \nNote: We suggest to run only 6 μL of each\n      RNA sample in the gel (6 lines in total per sample).\n    \nRun the gel for 65 min at 200 V.\n        Stain the gel for 3 min with 1× SYBR Gold in 1× TBE running buffer with\n        gentle shaking.\n      \n        Illuminate the stained gel using ultraviolet transillumination and\n        excise the 30 nt – 34 nt region between the NI-NI-19 and NI-NI-20 oligo\n        markers from each footprint sample.\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2936-Fig3.jpg\n              Figure 3.

We recommended to cut the middle region between 30 nt – 34 nt to\n      avoid contamination from rRNAs since the major contamination with rRNA was",
    "found between ∼28 nt and 35 nt (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\n    \n        Transfer each excised gel slice in a 2 mL non-stick RNase-free microfuge\n        tube.\n      \nNote: You can also process the oligo\n      marker bands as an internal control for the experiment.\n    \n        Add 400 μL of RNA gel extraction buffer to the polyacrylamide gel slices\n        and freeze the samples for 1 h at −80°C.\n      \nIncubate the samples overnight on a nutator at room temperature.\nNote: Overnight incubation increases the\n      reproducibly of the experiment.\n    \nPause point: At this point, the\n      protocol could be continued the next day.\n    \nPurification of footprint fragments\nTiming: 30 min - overnight\n    \nThis step describes the purification of footprint fragments.\n        Centrifuge the samples containing the gel slides at 16,100 × g\n        for 15 min at 4°C and transfer the supernatant (400 μL) into a 1.5 mL\n        non-stick RNase-free microfuge tube.\n      \nAdd 1.5 μg of GlycoBlue to each sample and vortex for 5 s.\nNote: It is suggested to use GlycoBlue to\n      increase the visibility of the pellet and to avoid losing the recovered\n      RNA footprints.\n    \n        Add 500 μL of isopropanol to the samples and vortex for 5 s.
