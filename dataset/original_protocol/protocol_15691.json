    "1. Measuring the intensity response relationship, prolonged depolarizing afterpotential (PDA), and the early receptor potential (ERP) using the electroretinogram\nSuitable rearing conditions for D. melanogaster preparation\n\t\nRaise D. melanogaster flies in bottles containing standard yellow corn containing food in an incubator maintained at a temperature of 24 °C and in a 12 h dark/light cycle\nKeep the fly bottles in the dark at least 24 h prior to the experiment.\nGeneral setup\n\t\nPrepare recording pipettes by pulling 1 mm x 0.58 mm (O.D x I.D) fiber-filled borosilicate glass capillaries (Figure 6L, O). The resistance of the pipettes should be 5-10 MΩ; any suitable puller can be used.\nCoat two silver wires with AgCl2, inserting 0.25 mm silver wire into 3 M KCl solution connected to a custom-made 5 V power supply.\nInsert each coated silver wire into the electrode holders (Figure 6N).\nFill the glass capillary with filtered Ringer's solution (see Table 1) using an elongated tip syringe (Figure 6M).\nInsert the wire electrode into the glass capillary. Ensure that the solution within the capillary is in contact with the silver wire.\nInsert the electrode holders (Figure 7P, N) into the two electrode micromanipulators (Figure 7G).\nProcedure of preparing the fly for electrical recordings\n\tNOTE: To keep the fly under dark-adapted conditions, use only dim red light illumination during the following steps.\n\t\nAnesthetize the flies in the bottle with CO2 gas using the fly sleeper system (Figure 6A, B) and pour them into the sleeper container.\nChoose one fly and carefully hold it by its wing using a sharp tweezer. Cover the rest of the flies with a Petri dish.\nPlace the fly on the fly holder in the proper orientation-lying on its side, with its back toward the hand (Figure 6P).",
    "Turn ON the power supply of the soldering iron. Set the current to ~2.25 A. This current should heat the 0.25 mm platinum-iridium filament to ~55-56 °C (see Supplemental File).\nPlace a drop of wax with a low melting temperature (~55-56 °C) on the soldering iron (Figure 6F).\nUsing tweezers, lift the fly from its wings and fix its wings to the fly holder (Figure 6I) using the soldering iron.\nUsing the soldering iron, connect the fly's back to the stand surface with wax (Figure 6P).\nLower the tip of the soldering iron onto the joining point of the legs and melt the wax to cover all the legs together (Figure 6P).\nPlace a small drop of wax between the head and the back in the neck area (Figure 6P).\n\t\tNOTE: Take special care to avoid overheating the fly head. Ensure that the fly is properly fixed and is unable to move during the experiment; minor movements may create artifacts in the recordings. Ensure that the trachea openings (breathing inlets) in the thorax and abdomen are not covered with wax.\nPlace the fly holder (Figure 7Q) in a dark Faraday cage on a magnet block (Figure 7I) and ensure that the fly is ~5 mm from the end of the light guide (Figure 7L).\nPlace the recording electrode (Figure 7P) above the fly's eye and the ground electrode (Figure 7N) over the fly's upper back using the micromanipulators.\nInsert the ground electrode into the back of the fly using the micromanipulators.\nInsert the recording electrode into the outer periphery of the fly's eye, preferably, using the micromanipulators.",
    "NOTE: After inserting the electrode into the eye, a small dimple will be observed; pull the electrode upwards without removing it from the eye until the dimple disappears. The electrodes can also be immersed in small droplets of electrode jelly applied at the torso and eye.\nIntensity-response protocol\n\t\nPlace an orange filter (590 edge filter) in front of the high-pressure Xenon lamp. Use a large (six orders of magnitude) attenuating neutral density (ND) filter.\nWait 60 s in the dark and give a 5 s light pulse.\nReplace the ND filter with a less attenuating ND filter in one order of magnitude increments.\nWait 60 s in the dark and give a second 5 s light pulse.\nRepeat Steps 1.4.1.-1.4.4, gradually increasing the light intensity using less attenuating ND filters (the last pulse should be generated with no ND filter at all). Ensure to use the series of ND filters in the proper direction, starting from large attenuation and reaching low attenuation.\nPDA protocol (this protocol can only be performed on white-eyed flies)\n\t\nGive a 5 s light pulse of maximal intensity using an orange filter (590 edge filter, to convert maximal photopigment to the R state).\nReplace the orange filter with a broad-band blue (BP450/40 nm) filter and give three 5 s light pulses at maximum intensity.\n\t\tNOTE: It is also possible to give a long continuous maximum intensity blue light pulse until a steady-state voltage response is reached.\nWait 60 s in the dark, replace the blue filter with the previous orange filter, and give two 5 s light pulses with 60 s intervals.\nERP/M-potential protocol for measuring the photo-equilibrium spectrum of M (this protocol can only be performed on white-eyed flies10,25)",
    "Give a continuous blue (bandpass (BP) 450/40 nm) light pulse until reaching a steady-state voltage response, which converts the maximal amount of photopigment from the R state to the M state of R1-6 cells.\nGive a brief (<3 ms) intense light flash of a wavelength between 350-700 nm (the known absorption spectrum of R1-6 cells photopigment) using narrow (~20 nm) bandpass filters and measure the peak amplitude of the M1 phase of the M potential response (which reflects the metarhodopsin absorption at this specific wavelength at photo-equilibrium10,25).\n\t\tNOTE: For synchronous activation of a large pool of photopigment molecules, a brief, intense flash of light is required so that the photon content will be packed in a short duration. The M potential is composed of two components: M1 (corneal negative phase), which reflects the charge displacement of the metarhodopsin in the photoreceptor, and M2 (corneal positive phase11,33), which reflects the amplified M1 response of the photoreceptors in the lamina9,10,11. Each of these components can be identified and measured. However, it is preferable to measure the M1 potential since it is a direct linear manifestation of the M levels. If M2 is used, make sure that its amplitude is in the linear range by using mild carotenoid deprivation24,25.\nGive a continuous blue (BP450/40 nm) light pulse again, followed by a brief (<1 ms) intense light flash of a different wavelength.\nRepeat this protocol until the entire absorption spectrum of M at photo equilibrium is covered.\n2. ERC protocol for measuring the action spectrum of R and the M states of R1-6 cells using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings",
    "NOTE: For a detailed protocol for using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings, see Katz et al.34. The M-potential uses the ERG to measure the activation of the M state only because the contribution of the R state is suppressed by the membrane capacitance. In contrast, the ERC measures the activation of both R (positive ERC) and M (negative ERC) states because voltage-clamp recordings remove the effect of membrane capacitance (see introduction).\nConvert the photopigment to the desired state (R or M). For R to M conversion, first, adapt the flies by a brief (<1 ms) adaptive blue (BP450/40 nm) flash. For M to R conversion, give a short adaptive orange (OG590 edge filter) flash.\nGive a brief light flash (<1 ms) of a wavelength between 350-700 nm and measure the maximal negative or positive amplitude of the ERC response, which reflects the M/R absorption at this specific wavelength.\n\tNOTE: For synchronous activation of a large pool of photopigment molecules, a brief, intense flash of light is required to pack the photon content in a short duration. The maximal photopigment conversion from R to M by blue flash can reach ~80% of the total photopigment molecules because of the overlap in the absorption spectrum of R and M (Figure 3A). Therefore, at wavelengths below ~550 nm, the ERC has two components: a negative phase that reflects the response of the metarhodopsin, and a positive phase that reflects the response of the remaining rhodopsin. The ERC depends linearly on light intensity (Figure 5D). Accordingly, to derive the spectral sensitivity of R and M states, each phase of the ERC needs to be normalized at the various wavelengths for equal energy29.\nRepeat Steps 2.1.-2.2. using flashes of different wavelengths.\nPlot the normalized positive and negative ERC as a function of wavelength.",
    "NOTE: The strong flash of light induces a massive current through the light-sensitive channels leading to metabolic stress on the photoreceptor, which, in turn, causes light-independent channel opening. The ERC is superimposed on this constitutive current.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
