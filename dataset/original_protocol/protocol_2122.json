Transcardiac perfusion of the mouse\n(A–D) Representative images showing the key steps for transcardiac perfusion of the mouse: (A) intraperitoneal injection of Avertin, (B and C) thoracotomy and (D) needle insertion in the left ventricle.\n(E and F) Images showing the whitening of (E) the tongue and (F) the liver.\n(G) Switch between PBS and PFA during perfusion.\nPinch the toe to be sure that mouse is deeply anesthetized.\nAfter the mouse is in deep anesthesia, prepare the mouse for the perfusion.\nArrange the mouse on its back and pin the four limbs down.\nBy using forceps and scissors clamp and cut the skin to expose the chest cavity (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nMake an incision in parallel and over the diaphragm, in order to avoid to pierce lung and heart.\nUncover the heart by cutting laterally the ribs with the scissors (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nInsert the perfusion needle in the apex of the left ventricle and cut open the right atrium with a small cut (by using small scissors) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nPerfuse the mouse with a peristaltic pump.\nPerfuse firstly with 5 mL PBS at RT to wash out the blood. When blood is fully washed out, mucosae, such as palms and tongue, and internal organs, such as the liver, become pale (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F and 1G; troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nSwitch to 4% PFA and continue perfusion up to final volume (for the final volume refer to Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nStop the pump.\nMove the tube from PBS to PFA (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).",
    "Start the pump.\nDissect the brain.\nCut the head.\nUncover the skull by removing the skin.\nOpen the skull.\ninsert the scissor (the flat part) under the lambda and cut the sagittal and interfrontal suture (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1708-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Brain dissection\n(A–D) Key steps of brain mouse brain dissection: (A) incision and (B and C) opening of the skull, (D) removal of the brain.\n(E and F) Representative images of the (E) dorsal and (F) ventral side of a brain with CCM lesions.\nlift up the pieces of skull to uncover the brain (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C).\nwith fine forceps carefully remove the brain from the skull (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D–2F).\nCollect the brain in a 50 mL tube with at least 10 mL 4% PFA.\nSee troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nPost-fix the brain in at least 10 mL 4% PFA overnight at 4°C.\nRemove PFA, wash twice with PBS and leave the brain in PBS.\n(Optional) If you want to analyze also the spinal cord, proceed as follow:\nRemove all the internal organs to gain access to the vertebral column.\nRemove the vertebral column by cutting with scissor the ribs and the pelvis.\nClean the vertebral column from the skin and other tissues.\nCollect the vertebral column in a 50 mL tube with at least 10 mL 4% PFA.\nPost-fix the vertebral column in at least 10 mL 4% PFA overnight at 4°C.\nRemove PFA, wash twice with PBS.\nGain access to the spinal cord by a ventral rostral-to-caudal laminectomy.\nCut a 200 μL pipette tip to make a 2–3 mm hole, and mount it on 5 mL syringe (without needle).\nCarefully flush the spinal cord out in rostral-to-caudal direction and collect it in a 50 mL tube with PBS.\nProceed with the following steps as for the brain.",
    "Note: You can stop here and store the tissues for few days at 4°C in PBS, before proceeding to step 8. However, for the best performance of the procedure, it is better to process immediately the tissue.\nCritical: Correct amount of fixative and speed of perfusion are critical to have an optimal fixation. The following table shows the right parameters to be used in relation to age and size of the animal.\nAgarose embedding and vibratome sectioning (part 2)\nTiming: 2–3 h for 10 brains\nThis second part describes brain embedding and sagittal sectioning.\nPrepare the brain for vibratome sectioning.\nDry the brain by rolling it over a paper towel.\nDivide the cerebral hemispheres cutting the medial part with a blade.\nPut one hemisphere in a disposable base mold (15 × 15 × 6 mm) with the inner face towards the bottom.\nCover the tissue with warm 4% low melting agarose solution and cool it on ice or at RT.\nWhen the agarose block is solidified, transfer it to the platform of the vibratome and fix it with glue.\nCut the whole cerebral hemisphere into 100 μm thick sagittal sections, at speed 1–1.5 mm/s and amplitude 1 mm.\nCollect the sections in PBS. Put 4/5 sections in each well of a 12-well plate keeping the order of sectioning.\nStore sections either in PBS at 4°C for 2 or 3 days or for almost 1 month at −20°C in freezing solution (40% PBS, 30% Glycerol, 30% Ethylene glycol).\nNote: Long term storage of the tissue may result in bad staining and imaging.\nPrimary and secondary antibody staining (part 3)\nTiming: 24 h\nThis part describes the staining procedure.",
    "From the 12-well plate where the sections were collected, select one section from each well and put them in a new well of a 12-well plate. In this way, the selected sections will be around 4–500 μm far away from each other and representative of the whole hemisphere.\nIncubate sections in 1 mL blocking solution for 1 h at RT.\nIncubate sections with primary antibody anti-PECAM1, diluted 1:200 in 0.5 mL fresh blocking solution, at 4°C overnight.\nThe next day, wash 3 times with 1 mL PBS at RT for 10′.\nIncubate sections with goat anti-Hamster-CY3 diluted 1:200 in PBS at RT for 4 h.\nRemove solution and wash 3 times with 1 mL PBS for 10′.\nPost fix the stained sections with 4% PFA for 5′ at RT.\nNote: This step fixes primary and secondary antibodies to the antigen, thus prolonging the stability of the stain.\nWash 3 times with 1 mL PBS for 10′.\nMove brain sections in a petri dish filled with PBS-T (PBS + 0.01% triton-X100).\nUsing a fine brush, mount the sections on a superfrost glass slide.\nLet the sections dry at RT for 20 min before mounting with Vectashield solution.\nSeal the slides with nail polish and leave overnight at 4°C.\nConfocal acquisition (part 4)\nTiming: 8 h for 10 brains\nThis part describes the confocal acquisition of brain sections. The following settings refer to a Leica TCS SP8-DLS confocal microscope equipped with LAS-X plus Navigator software.\nDifferent systems may have other functions to navigate throughout the slide, such as the Mark&Find or the Tiling tool.\nSwitch on the software and the laser.\nFirst scan with the navigator system the whole slide with a 2.5× objective to visualize all the brain sections mounted.\nDefine a region of interest (ROI) around each single section.",
    "Set the 10× objective and redefine the Z-stack of each section, using a 10 μm z-step.\nAcquire zoom 1×, bidirectional scanning and resolution set at 1024 × 1024 pixels, frequency 400 Hz.\nZ-stack Images are merged and ready to be saved and processed as \".lif” file.\nSee troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] to fix eventual problems with the staining.\nImaging analysis (part 5)\nTiming: 1–2 days for 10 brains\nOpen the Fiji software.\nOpen “set measurement” and select “Area”, as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1708-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Screenshot of the “Set Measurements” tool of Fiji software\nBefore starting with the analysis, open the “Set Measurements” tool and select “Area”.\nOpen the image with the Fiji software.\nPerform Z-projection of the section with max intensity.\nMake sure the image is calibrated and dimensions expressed in μm. If not, refer to troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] to calibrate the image.\nOpen the ROI MANAGER tool.\nDraw the outline of the whole section as shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], and add it to the ROI Manager. This will give you the area of the entire section, also referred to as “Analyzed area”.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1708-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Representative screenshot of brain section outline\nRepresentative screenshot of a sagittal brain section during quantification process. White line represents the outline of the section.\nDraw the outline of each single lesion and add it to the ROI MANAGER (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). CCM lesions can be easily identify and distinguished by normal vessels. In the brain, the majority of vasculature is composed of capillaries and small vessels which usually have a lumen of around 3–7 μm and 15–40 μm, respectively (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). On the contrary, lesions appear as enlarged vessels with a “bubble” shape and frequently form multi-lumen clusters (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C). Lesion diameter can easily exceed 300–500 μm.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1708-Fig5.jpg",

Arrowheads: yellow = normal capillaries, white = normal larger vessels, blue = lesions. Scale bar = 100 μm.\nMeasure the area of all ROIs with the “Measure all” tool of the ROI MANAGER (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nCopy and paste the measurements from the “Results” window to an Excel file (see Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1708-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Example of lesion quantification and analysis\nRepresentative Excel sheet showing the analysis process. Calculations are shown with blue font. Final values for Lesioned area and Number of lesions are shown in the box.\nConvert the “Analyzed area” from μm2 to mm2 (cells D5:D7 in the Excel table shown in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nThe “Lesioned area” is obtained by summing the area of all the single lesions in the section (cells F5:F7 in the Excel table shown in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nThe “Number” of lesions is obtained by counting the lesions of the section (cells F1:F3 in the Excel table shown in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nFinally, both “Lesioned area” and “Number” of lesions are divided for the “Analyzed area mm2” (cells H5:H7 and H1:3 in the Excel table shown in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], respectively).\nRepeat steps 32–43 for each section.\nThe average of the values for each single section represents the value for a single mouse."
