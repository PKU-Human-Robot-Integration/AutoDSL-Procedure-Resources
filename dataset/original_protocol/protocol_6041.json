    "Vector constructionSingle short hairpin constructionShort hairpins designDesign primers for short hairpins (21 nt) on http://biodev.cea.fr/DSIR/DSIR.html[href=http://biodev.cea.fr/DSIR/DSIR.html] website: first, copy the sequence of exon within the gene, and then paste the sequence to predict the siRNA with this web tool. Based on the parameters we defined (Figure 2), the siRNA with the highest score will be selected. To avoid the off-target effect, use BLAST to compare the siRNA against the fly genome of FlyBase website (http://flybase.org/[href=http://flybase.org/]) to ensure the 21 nt sequence has more than 5 nt that mismatch to other genes. “As re-com” sequence is sense sequence of the short hairpin. “As” sequence is the antisense sequence of the short hairpin.

Parameters for short hairpins designAnnealingPerform the annealing reaction as follows, and then put the Eppendorf tube into PCR equipment. Denature the primers at 95 °C for 5 min, and then turn off the power of PCR equipment to let it cool down slowly to room temperature. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190129/20190129193512_4379.jpgDigestionUse EcoRI/NheI restriction endonucleases for pNP vector (Figure 1) digestion, and then separate the fragments with 1.5% agarose gels. Cut and purify the larger DNA fragment around 8,000 bp with AxyPrepTM DNA Gel Extraction Kit. Perform the digestion reaction as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190129/20190129193556_2849.jpgLigationLigate the linearized pNP vector with the annealing product using T4 DNA ligase. Perform the ligation reaction as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190129/20190129193619_3348.jpgMix and incubate at 25 °C for 20 min, and then put 2-5 µl ligation product into 10 µl Trans5α Chemically Competent Cell following the standard protocol, and spread on an LB-agar plate containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin. Incubate the plate overnight at 37 °C, upside down.Select correct clonesMark and pick clones to the PCR mix. Primers sequences are U-F: 5’-GCTGAGAGCATCAGTTGTGA-3’, Ftz: 5’-TAATCGTGTGTGATGCCTACC-3’.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190129/20190129193644_3498.jpgSet up and run the PCR program as follows: imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190129/20190129193719_3366.",
    "jpgIdentify the correct clones based on the size of the PCR product. By gel electrophoresis, the correct clones give around 750 bp bands, and the wrong clones appear either 1,000 bp or no band.Amplify the correct clone: Pick up the correct clone into 5 ml of LB medium containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin and incubate overnight at 37 °C at 250 rpm.Extract plasmid using AxyPrepTM Plasmid Miniprep Kit, and further confirm the right clone by DNA sequencing with the primer (U-F: 5’-GCTGAGAGCATCAGTTGTGA-3’).Construct multiple shRNAs in one vectorFor the two or more short hairpins in one vector, we first clone all short hairpins into the pNP vector respectively as mentioned above.Linearize vector pNP-shRNA1 using SpeI at 37 °C for 90 min as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190129/20190129193744_8551.jpgBefore gel electrophoresis, use CIP to treat the cutting product to dephosphorylating at 37 °C for 10 min as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190129/20190129193811_6745.jpgPurify the product using AxyPrepTM DNA Gel Extraction Kit.Digest another hairpin vector using SpeI and XbaI to release the fragment (300 bp) containing a different short hairpin as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190129/20190129193840_4153.jpgSeparate the digested products on an agarose gel and extract smaller DNA fragment around 300 bp from the agarose gel with AxyPrepTM DNA Gel Extraction Kit. Finally, using T4 DNA ligase ligate the linearized pNP-shRNA1 with the released fragment (shRNA2). Following transformation, use primers (U-F: 5’-GCTGAGAGCATCAGTTGTGA-3’, Ftz: 5’-TAATCGTGTGTGATGCCTACC-3’) to identify the correct clones by PCR, which give around 1,000 bp. Then further confirm these correct plasmids by DNA sequencing.To clone the third shRNA, the two shRNA containing vector is digested with SpeI again and then ligated with another short hairpin fragment released from hairpin vector by SpeI and XbaI digestion.Purify and inject the correct pNP-shRNA vectorPurification of the plasmid DNAExtract plasmid DNA (~10 mg) using PurePlasmid Mini Kit as per the manufacturer’s instructions.",
    "Elute the plasmid DNA with 70 μl of 1x Injection Buffer. The appropriate concentration of each sample is 100-200 mg/ml, which is determined by using NanoDrop 2000.Injection of the plasmid DNA to fliesInject the purified plasmid DNA to flies (Chromosome II TB00016; Chromosome III TB00018) following the standard protocol (Ni et al., 2011). For knocking down a gene on the second chromosome, choose TB00016 to microinject, while a gene on the third chromosome to choose TB00018. Keep the injected embryos at 25 °C and 60% humidity to adult (G0).Selection protocols after G0 eclosion (Figures 3 and 4 are overviews of screening procedure)Once the G0 flies begin to hatch into adults, cross them to the TB00077 (vermillion eye color).Note: For injections into y,v stocks, G0s should all have vermillion eyes. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190129/20190129193353_4005.jpgFigure 3. Overview of the selection procedures for generating Chromosome II transgenic fliesWhen adult G1 flies begin to eclose, screen G1 transformants. Remember that the pNP vector carry a copy of vermillion (v+), so G1 transformants will have a dark red wild type (v+) eye color.Cross the appropriate balancer stocks to ♂ G1 transformants from ♂ G0 parents (For Chromosome II integration into an attP40 site, G1 flies were crossed with TB00023. For Chromosome III integration into an attP2 site, G1 flies were crossed with TB00139). When G2 flies begin to eclose, collect ♂ and virgin ♀ siblings that have v+ (wild type) eye color and CyO (for Chromosome II insertions) or TM3 (for Chromosome III insertions), and cross siblings to each other to screen for homozygous transgenic flies. Collect ♂ G3 and virgin ♀ G3 siblings, and cross siblings to each other to make sure that the homozygous transgenic flies were fertile.♂ transformants from ♀ G0 parents need to backcross TB00077 again to remove phiC31 integrase.",

The following sequential steps are consistent with the Step B3c.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190129/20190129193411_0395.jpgFigure 4.
