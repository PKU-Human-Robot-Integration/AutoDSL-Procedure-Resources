    "Both adenylate and pyrimidine nucleotide act as “currency” within living cells and play an important role in regulating plant growth and development (Gakière, Fernie, & Pétriacq, 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20115#cppb20115-bib-0010]; Geigenberger, Riewe, & Fernie, 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20115#cppb20115-bib-0012]). Although several publications use different approaches for measurement of adenylate and pyrimidine nucleotide, there is no detailed protocol for the measurement of these compounds in plants. Here, we present detailed protocols for sampling and extraction of whole seedlings, leaves, or roots. Because of the extremely high turnover rates of adenylate and pyrimidine nucleotides (down to milliseconds), plant material needs to be harvested as rapidly as possible, then instant-frozen, ideally by using the freeze-clamping technique (Ap Rees, Fuller, & Wright, 1977[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20115#cppb20115-bib-0002]). When working with leaves, it is important to quench the samples directly in light, and not to alter the incident irradiance via shading. Given the instability of these metabolites, the plant materials should be frozen at –80°C for no more than 1 year. Here, we use Arabidopsis leaves as an example.\nMaterials\nPlant material\nLiquid nitrogen\n2-ml microcentrifuge tubes\n1.5 ml Safe-Lock tubes\nBall mill (Retsch)\nBalance\n1. Harvest around 100 mg of Arabidopsis or other plant leaf material in a 2.0-ml tube and snap-freeze it in liquid nitrogen.\n2. Homogenize the plant material in a ball mill by adding a clean and pre-cooled metal ball to the leaf material, and grind for 30-45 s at medium speed.\n3. Transfer aliquots of approximately 25 mg (±2 mg) to new 1.5-ml tubes and record the exact weight.\n4. If assays cannot be performed immediately, store samples at –80°C until measurement.",
    "As the “molecular unit of currency” of intracellular energy transfer, ATP is a metabolite that provides energy to multiple processes in the living cell, including protein synthesis, chemical synthesis, metabolism, cell division, and transport processes. It can be converted to either ADP or AMP when consumed in living cells. Measurement of ATP, ADP, and AMP have been described in several articles (Liang et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20115#cppb20115-bib-0017]; Pham et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20115#cppb20115-bib-0021]; Zhang et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20115#cppb20115-bib-0035]; Zhu et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20115#cppb20115-bib-0038]), but detailed protocols are unavailable.

    "The analysis of adenosines is performed by reversed-phase HPLC on a Hyperclone C18 (ODS) column connected to an HPLC system (Dionex).

    "As the cofactor of the central metabolism, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) carries electrons from one reaction to another and is deeply involved in the regulation of redox. Oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) accepts electrons from other molecules and converts to the reduced form (NADH), especially in glycolysis and the mitochondrial TCA cycle (Zhang & Fernie, 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20115#cppb20115-bib-0033]; Zhang et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20115#cppb20115-bib-0032]; Youjun Zhang et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20115#cppb20115-bib-0035]). Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) is a cofactor in anabolic reactions, such as lipid and nucleic acid biosynthesis and the Calvin cycle, which use NADPH as a reducing agent (Kern et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20115#cppb20115-bib-0015]). NAD+ can be converted to NADP+ by NAD+ kinase via the addition of a further phosphate group at the 2′ position of the ribose ring that carries the adenine moiety.\nIn this protocol, the reduced forms, i.e., NADH or NADPH, are first selectively destroyed at low pH and high temperature; then, NAD+ and NADP+ are measured using highly sensitive cycling assays. Alcohol dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation of ethanol, which involves the reduction of NAD+ (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20115#cppb20115-fig-0002]), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation of glucose 6-phosphate, which involves the reduction of NADP+ (Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20115#cppb20115-fig-0002]). Phenazine ethosulfate then catalyzes the reduction of MTT into deep-purple formazan, the absorbance of which can be measured at 570 nm. Concomitantly, the re-oxidation of NADH or NADPH makes it possible to re-commence the oxidation of ethanol or glucose-6-phosphate. This cycle, which obeys a zero-order kinetic rate law, is maintained at a constant rate as long as its substrates, i.e., ethanol or glucose-6-phosphate, and MTT, are saturating.\nMaterials\nβ-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrate (NAD+, Roche 10127990001)\nβ-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate disodium salt (NADP+, Roche 10128031001)\n0.1 M HCl\nLiquid nitrogen\n0.1 M perchloric acid (HClO4)\nSample: Arabidopsis leaf material prepared as in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20115#cppb20115-prot-0001]",

In the ATP/ADP/AMP measurement (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20115#cppb20115-prot-0002]), we use 200 µl extraction buffer and 15 µl reaction buffer. 10-µl samples are injected into the column. Here we use ATP as the example and the analysis ADP or AMP methods are same as for ADP (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20115#cppb20115-fig-0003]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4c79e4c2-3e6c-4cd0-9de7-b7d628eb562f/cppb20115-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nExample of data analysis for the level of ATP. (A) The ATP standard used for the standard curve. (B) ATP standard curve used to get the slope and blank values. (C) The data for the ATP measurement and the calculation method. FW, fresh weight (of plant material sample).\n2. First, we analyze the ATP standards from the HPLC and get the values of slope and blank (Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20115#cppb20115-fig-0003]).\n3. After we get the slope, we can calculate concentrations within samples as shown in Fig. 3C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20115#cppb20115-fig-0003]. Briefly, the reaction concentration is calculated as (value − blank)/slope and normalized by dilution factor and fresh weight (FW). Normally, the final level is normalized to provide a value with the units µmol/gFW (Fig. 3C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20115#cppb20115-fig-0003]), where gFW refers to the fresh weight of the plant material in grams.",
    "4. Similarly to the ATP analysis, the concentrations of pyrimidine nucleotide are also normalized from the standard. Here, we use NAD+ as an example (Fig. 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20115#cppb20115-fig-0004]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/957c13ab-6675-4670-8907-803d6da2c2f5/cppb20115-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nExample of data analysis for the level of NAD+. (A) The standard of the NAD+ used for the standard curve. (B) NAD+ standard curve used to get the slope and blank. (C) The data of the NAD+ measurement and the calculation method. FW, fresh weight (of plant material sample).\n5. We first use the raw data of the standard to get the slope and Vblank (Fig. 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20115#cppb20115-fig-0004]).\n6. After we get the slope, we can go back to the concentration of samples as shown in Figure 4C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20115#cppb20115-fig-0004]. Briefly, the concentration is calculated as (value + blank)/slope and normalized by dilution factor, sample volume, and fresh weight. Usually, the final level is normalized to provide a value with the units nmol/gFW, where gFW refers to the fresh weight of the plant material in grams."
