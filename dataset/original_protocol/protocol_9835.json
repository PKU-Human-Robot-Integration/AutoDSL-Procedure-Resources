    "1. Microfluidic chips design\nDesign the microfluidic multiplexer consisting of 18 inlets, each of which is controlled by an individual valve and a peristaltic pump. To increase the liquid volume driven by per pumping cycle, have the peristaltic pump be composed of 3 control channels, which was purposely widened to 200 µm, and 10 connected flow lines.\nDesign the shear-free culture chamber. Replication of the 2-level culture unit is composed by a lower cell culture chamber (400 µm x 400 µm x 150 µm) and a higher buffer layer (400 µm x 400 µm x 75 µm), which prevents unwanted shear stress on cells during medium exchange (Figure 1).\nDesign high-throughput features. Duplicate the culture unit to form a 30 x 50 matrix layout, occupying an area of approximately 7 cm by 5 cm in size.\n2. Chip fabrication and operation\nFabrication of the replica molding using UV lithography\n\tNOTE: The replica molding was fabricated on silicon wafer according to the standard photolithography protocol8.\n\t\nFabrication the channel structures\n\t\t\nSpinning photoresist: Spin coat 5 mL of the SU-8 3025 negative photoresist on a silicon wafer at 500 rpm for 10 s and 3000 rpm for 30 s.\nSoft bake: Put the wafer on a hotplate at 65 °C for 2 min and then 95 °C for 10 min, Cool it down to room temperature.\nAlignment and curing: Fix the wafer and mask on the holder of the aligner and turn on the light source for 18 s to cure the exposed photoresist.\nPre post exposure bake: Ramp up the wafer to 95°C at 110°C/h from room temperature and keep it at least 40 min till removing.",
    "Develop: Dip the wafer in the developing solution (SU-8 developer) and agitate it for 2.5 min to wash off redundant photoresist and get the 25 µm-high channel structure.\nHard bake: Cover the wafer with glass Petri dish and bake at 65 °C for 2 min, then ramp up to 160°C at 120 °C/h and keep it for 3 hours.\nFabrication of the cell culture chamber with the buffer layer\n\t\t\nUse the parameters of step 2.1.1.1 to spin coat 7 mL of the SU-8 3075 negative photoresist on the above wafer.\nSoft bake (described in step 2.1.1.2) the wafer and change the mask to align well with markers on the wafer. Then turn on the light source for 24 s to cure the exposed photoresist.\nDip the wafer to the developing solution (SU-8 developer) and agitate it for 4 minutes and 40 seconds to wash off redundant photoresist and get a 75 µm-high layer structure that around the 25 µm-high channel structure fabricated before. Hard bake (described in step 2.1.1.6) the wafer to make the complex structure stronger.\nRepeat steps 2.1.2.1-2.1.2.3 to fabricate a 75 µm-high chamber structure that stack on the layer structure.\nFabrication of the valve structures\n\t\t\nUsing the parameter of step 2.1.1.1 to spin coat 5 mL of the AZ 50x positive photoresist on the above wafer.\nSoft bake (described in step 2.1.1.2) the wafer and make the mask aligned well with markers on the wafer, then keep the light source on for 20 s and off immediately for 30 s. Repeat the light on/ off procedure in 5 circles to cure the exposed photoresist.",
    "Dip the wafer to matched developer and agitate it for about 8 min to wash off redundant photoresist and get the round-shaped valves that overlap with the control channels to ensure good connection. Hard bake (described in step 2.1.1.6) the patterned wafer to make the whole model stronger.\nMicrofluidic chip production using soft lithography\n\t\nTreat the patterned and blank silicon wafers with rimethylchlorosilane for 15 min.\nPrepare 3 portions of PDMS gel (10:1 of monomer/catalyst ratio) corresponding to 50 g of flow layer, 20 g of control layer 2, and 20 g of membrane, respectively.\nCast 50 g of PDMS gel on the patterned silicon wafer, and de-gas them for 1-2 hours in the vacuum chamber at -0.85 MPa to copy the flow layer.\nDegas the 2 portions of 20 g of PDMS and spin it on the patterned wafer and a blank silicon wafer at 2000-2800 rpm for 30 s as to prepare a control layer and membrane layer.\nPut the PDMS-covered wafers into ventilating oven for 60 min at 80 °C for incubation.\nAlign and bond the different layers together through customized optical device (zoom in 100x) and plasma etching machine. Then keep it in a ventilating oven for 2 hours at 80 °C to enhance the bonding of the chip.\nPunch the inlet holes on the chip, and then bond it onto a PDMS-coated coverslip and cured for at least 12 hours at 80 °C before use.\nChip operation\n\t\nConnect miniature pneumatic solenoid valves to the control layer of the chip, and open the customized MATLAB graphical user interface8 to link and control the switch.\nSet the closing pressures of push-up PDMS membrane valves to 25 psi.\nDeliver dynamically changing combinatorial/sequential inputs to designated chambers (Figure 2d) by timely on-off of the valves.",
    "3. Generation of dynamic inputs in cellular microenvironments\nChip treatment and cell loading\n\t\nMaintain the standard culture conditions (37 °C, 5% CO2) on the microscope for at least 5 hours.\nFill the chip with coating medium (i.e., mentioned in the NOTE) and incubate it at the standard culture conditions (described in step 3.1.1) for at least one hour.\nFlush the chip by phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or cell culture medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium, DMEM) to build a healthy culture environment.\nHarvest cells at 80% confluency, and resuspend the cells using culture media (DMEM) at a density of ~ 106/mL. Then load cells into the chip by pressurizing the cell-containing solution.\n\t\tNOTE: Culturing different cell lines on chip requires corresponding coating medium to treat the cell culture chamber. Typically, for experiments on 3T3 fibroblast and adherent culture of hen all valves controlling the culture chambers are open, cells flow into all culture chambers within the same column.\nSetup for high throughput live-cell imaging\n\tNOTE: For image acquisition, an inverted microscope with an automated translational stage and a digital complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) camera were used. The stage and image acquisition were controlled via the customized software.\n\t\nVisualize the matrix of culture chambers using 10x objective lens in bright field to affirm and define the location coordinates of each chamber of the 30 by 50 chamber matrix.\nTransform the objective lens to the 20x or 40x, then select the location coordinates of the desired chamber and the translational stage moves to the assigned position after confirmation. Fine tune the x, y, z focal plane to get an optimal image.\nOptimal the light intensity, expose time, and other imaged parameters were determined individually for each channel (i.e., bright-field and fluorescence imaging).",
