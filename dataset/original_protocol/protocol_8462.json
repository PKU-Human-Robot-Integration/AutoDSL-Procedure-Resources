    "The study described here followed the local ethic guidelines and was approved by the regional ethical review board in Linköping (permit number 2015/99-31).\n1. Informed Consent and Screening\nObtain informed consent from the subject.\nScreen according to inclusion/exclusion criteria.\n\tNOTE: Inclusion criteria were: (i) Healthy adult >18 years of age, (ii) Able to understand written and oral information, and (iii) Provides oral and written consent. Exclusion criteria were: (i) Unable or unwilling to provide informed consent, (ii) Ongoing skin conditions, (iii) Cardiovascular disease, (iv) Medication that can interfere with vascular function. Oral contraceptives are allowed. If the subject uses oral contraceptives this should be noted on the subject's protocol file, (v) Scar free and non-bruised skin of the forehead, (vi) No intake of caffeine or tobacco 2 h prior to the onset of the test, and (vii) No strenuous physical activity at least 2 h prior to onset of the test.\n2. Acclimatization and Equipment Setup\nLet the test subject acclimatize for at least 20 min in a supine position prior to the onset of the test.\n\tNOTE: Correct positioning of the subject and equipment is shown in supplemental figure 1.\nSet up the camera recording of the capillary refill tests using the designated software and digital camera (see Table of Materials).\nConnect the USB cable to the camera and the computer and adjust camera settings to video mode.\nTurn on the camera and make sure that it connects to the computer.\nStart the remote-controlled camera software (see Table of Materials).\nTurn off ambient light and turn the computer screen away from the measurement area.\n3. Data Acquisition\nClick the \"life view\" (Sic) button and press \"Start\".",
    "Switch between 'video' mode and 'TiVi' mode by clicking the radio buttons (this will not affect the recording, only the on-screen presentation). Ensure that a live video stream of the subject's forehead is visible on the display of the camera and on the computer screen.\nAdjust the camera to a height of approximately 15 cm directly above the subject's forehead.\nMake sure that the focus of the camera is set to \"AF\" (auto focus).\nAsk the subject to keep his/her head still for the duration of the test and to refrain from talking. Inform the subject that it is OK to keep his/her eyes closed during the test by saying: \"Please, place your head on this pillow and keep your head still for the duration of the test. Please, do not talk during the 20 seconds that the test will last. You may keep your eyes closed for the whole time if you find the light too bright\".\nDo not move the camera while recording.\nIn the \"life view\" window find and click \"HD record\" to start a continuous recording for 20 s. Note that the duration of the recording (seconds), can be seen on the camera display; the first 5 s of the recording is to acquire the normal capillary blood concentration of the forehead.\nAt the end of the 5 s of baseline recording, apply a firm blanching pressure to the measurement area for 5 s. Use the index finger with a plastic teaspoon between the finger and the forehead for pressure equalization and temperature insulation.\nRelease the pressure and quickly withdraw the examiner's finger and plastic teaspoon from the measurement area.\nContinue recording for another 10 s to capture the subsequent hyperemic response.\nStop recording by clicking \"Stop\" in the \"life view\" window.",
    "Once the recording has stopped, a window will open for saving and naming the file (in .mov format); choose a folder and name for the video. Do not disconnect the camera from the computer while the video is downloading to the designated folder on the computer.\n4. Data Analysis\nProceed to performing image analysis and curve construction with a dedicated analysis software (see Table of Materials).\nStart the analysis software by double-clicking the desktop icon.\nOnce the software has started, on the main screen, select \"Movie page.\"\nIn the \"Movie page\" window, click \"Load movie.\" Wait for the software to upload and analyze the movie. This may take up to a couple of minutes depending on the size of the video file.\nOnce the upload and analysis of the movie is finished, click \"Save as images\" and wait for the software to analyze the video.\n\tNOTE: This will automatically create a new folder on the computer containing the video sequence divided into individual jpeg images.\nOnce the division of the video into individual jpeg images is finished, find and select \"Crop images page\" in the main screen window.\nIn the \"Crop images page\", click \"First Photo\" and navigate to the folder that contains the jpeg photos from the video and select the first photo to be analyzed; the software will automatically select the following photos of that batch.\nClick the \"Edit\" menu and choose between circular or rectangular markers for the region of interest.\nIn the \"Select Photos\" window, find the \"Actual photo\" box and type in the name of the first photo in the batch where the investigator's finger is fully retracted from the measurement area. To find this photo, look through the folder containing the individual photos from the video.",
    "Select a region of interest by clicking and holding the left mouse button and draw a circle or rectangle in the photo window that is within the borders of the blanched area. The selected region of interest is automatically applied to all photos of the batch.\nClick the \"File\" menu and choose \"Save ROI\" to save the location of the selected region of interest for future reference.\nClick the \"Curve tracker\" button and wait for the software to analyze the region of interest.\nOnce the curve tracker window opens, the change in red blood cell concentration for the selected region of interest for the duration of the test is displayed as a curve. The on-screen presentation can be changed by clicking the different radio buttons. This will not affect the raw data.\nClick \"Export data\" and save the raw data transcript for further analysis.\nIn the raw data transcript, navigate to the column named \"Mean intensity TiVi values.\" Generate three new columns next to this column for \"image number,\" \"total time,\" and \"capillary refill time\" starting at 1 s, 0 s, and 0 s and with an incrementation of 1 s, 0.02 s, and 0.02 s, respectively.\n\tNOTE: \"Capillary refill time\" correlates to the time of the subsequent reaction to the release of the blanching pressure and starts at the mean value that represents the first photo where the investigator's finger is fully retracted from the measurement area.\nDelete the values between baseline and capillary refill time, as these only contain noise generated by the investigator's index finger and plastic teaspoon during the blanching maneuver.\nCalculate a mean value for the baseline measurement (first 5 s of the recording).",
    "Find the first value that equals or surpasses the calculated mean baseline value and note the time in the \"Capillary refill time\" column. This time point represents the \"time to return to baseline 1.\"\nFind the highest mean intensity value of the values generated after pressure release and note the time point in the \"Capillary refill time\" column. This time point represents the \"Time to peak.\"\nFind the second value that is less than or equal to the calculated mean value for the baseline measurement and note the time point in the \"Capillary refill time\" column. This time point represents the \"time to return to baseline 2.\"\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
