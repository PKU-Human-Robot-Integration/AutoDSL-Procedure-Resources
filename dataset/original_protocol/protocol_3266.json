    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\n      Optogenetic assay using the copulation-triggered photostimulation system\n    \nTiming: 15–20 days (for step 1)\n    \nTiming: 1–2 days (for step 2)\n    \nTiming: 1 h per experiment (for step 3)\n    \n      The copulation-triggered photostimulation system detects copulation events\n      in real time and turns on the green laser required for GtACR1-mediated\n      inhibition of neural activity. This system allows for the inhibition of\n      specific neural circuits in males only during copulation. In this assay,\n      we use males that express GtACR111[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] in\n      piezo-expressing neurons (w1118; +/+; piezo-GAL4/UAS-GtACR1.d.EYFP). As a mating partner, we use\n      wild-type females. See\n      key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] for details on fly\n      strains.\n    \n        Prepare GtACR1-expressing male flies.\n        \n            Set up the fly crosses. Introduce parental flies (4–5\n            piezo-GAL4 males and UAS-GtACR1 virgin females) into\n            vials containing fly media. The detailed genotypes are listed in the\n            key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table].\n          \nTransfer parental flies (F0 fly) to fresh vials every 5 days.\n            Collect F1 males of the desired genotypes according to step 1 in\n            before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin].\n          \nNote: F0 flies are transferred to fresh\n      vials up to 2 times.\n    \nNote: Set-up several vials at a time to\n      obtain enough F1 male flies.\n    \nNote: Wild-type females are prepared as\n      mating partners according to step 1 in Before you begin.\n    \nPause point: The experimenter can\n      decide the timing of subsequent feeding of all-trans-retinal (ATR) as long\n      as the tested flies are within 5–8 days after eclosion at the time of the\n      optogenetic assay.\n    \n        Feeding of ATR. Male flies of the experimental group are fed food\n        containing ATR. Control males are fed food containing ethanol (EtOH)\n        solvent.\n        \nPrepare plastic tubes containing ∼150 μL of fly food.\n            For the experimental group, add 2 μL of ATR, 25 mg/mL dissolved in\n            99.5% EtOH (need to be prepared just before use) on the food",
    "surface. For the control group, add 2 μL of 99.5% EtOH on the food\n            surface instead of ATR.\n          \n            Transfer males to a plastic tube containing fly food with the\n            surface covered with ATR (or EtOH) 24–36 h before the experiment.\n          \n            Keep the male flies on prepared food for 24–36 h in the dark before\n            being used for the assays.\n            \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3036-Fig5.jpg\n                  Figure 5. Maintenance conditions for GtACR1-expressing\n                  male flies while feeding ATR or ethanol\n                \n                  (A) Put the plastic tubes horizontally in the box to feed ATR\n                  or ethanol to the flies and keep them in the dark.\n                \n                  (B) Lateral view of the optogenetic assay. Red circle\n                  indicates the laser focusing area. Scale bar, 1 mm.\n                \nNote: ATR is a light-sensitive pigment\n      that enables ion flux through green-light absorption of GtACR1.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]\nCritical: After placing a male fly in\n      a plastic tube containing ATR or EtOH, the tubes should be stored\n      horizontally to prevent the male fly from sticking to the food surface (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\n    \n        Perform optogenetic assay.\n        \n            Put a fixed female at the center of a courtship chamber (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H, see step 2 in before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]).\n          \n            The green laser is positioned using a manipulator to adjust the\n            focusing area to the female genitalia. This adjustment allows\n            irradiation on the male genitalia during copulation (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\n          \nIntroduce a male fly into the chamber without anesthesia.\nEnclose them with a cover glass.\n            Run a custom Bonsai script and take movies. The Bonsai script\n            operates a monochrome CMOS camera and two color CMOS cameras.\n          \n            The two calibration LEDs are turned on at the beginning of each\n            recording to calibrate the start timing of movies recorded by each\n            camera (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F).\n            \n                For calibration of time-stamps in each movie, blink the two\n                calibration LEDs three times so that LED lights appear on two",
    "cameras (Camera-A and Camera-B) at the beginning of each movie\n                file.\n              \n                In the analysis step, the onsets of movies are aligned based on\n                the calibration LED of each movie.\n                \nNote: When a copulation event\n                  is detected by “Arduino-b”, laser photostimulation is turned\n                  on after a predetermined delay period (5 min in our case).\n                  During photostimulation, male piezo-expressing neurons\n                  are suppressed.\n                \n            Stop the Bonsai program after ∼1 h or copulation has finished."
