    "1. Preparing the Cells for Live Imaging\nCell culture and seeding\nUse MCF-7 breast cancer cells selected for resistance to docetaxel (MCF-7TXT) and their non-resistant parental cell line (MCF-7CC). The detailed selection process and the characterization of these selected cell lines were described previously24.\nGrow all cells in 10 cm culture dishes at 37 °C in a medium composed 90% of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and 10% of fetal bovine serum (FBS) and supplemented with non-essential amino acids. Maintain the medium in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Maintain MCF-7TXT cells at 5 nM docetaxel.\nSeed cells on coverslips for live imaging. Sterilize 24 mm poly-L-lysine-coated glass coverslips by rinsing them with 70% alcohol and then exposing them to UV overnight. Place the coverslips into a 6-well culture plate of 35 mm. Place one coverslip in each well.\nRemove the medium from the 10-cm culture dish and wash the cells with PBS. Add 0.5 mL of trypsin-EDTA to the dish to detach the cells from the dish. Add 5 mL of culture medium to the dish to neutralize the trypsin following the detachment of the cells.\nCount the cells with a hemocytometer to determine the number of cell per unit volume.\nAdd approximately 105 cells to each well based on the cell number per unit volume. After shaking it gently, put the plate back into the incubator to allow the cells to attach to the coverslips.\nExpression of GFP-tagged α-tubulin\nTo assay microtubule dynamics, transduce the cells with GFP-tagged α-tubulin with the commercial GFP transduction control (e.g., BacMam) according to the manufacturer's protocol.\nCulture the cells in the well for 36 h in a 37 °C cell culture incubator to allow complete adhesion and 60% confluence.",
    "Calculate the appropriate volume of GFP-tagged α-tubulin to add to each well, according to the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55027/55027eq1.jpg\n\t\tThe number of cells is the estimated total number of cells in the well at the time of labeling and the desired PPC is the number of particles per cell.\n\t\t​NOTE: Seeding the MCF-7 cells should have doubled the cell count from 105 to 2 x 105 with a desired PPC of 20, the volume needed for each coverslip is therefore 40 µL. For different cells, the volume calculated based on the above formula may not be the best. The exact volume should be adjusted according to the actual expression level of GFP-tubulin.\nMix the GFP-tagged α-tubulin several times by inversion to ensure a homogenous solution. Do not vortex.\n\t\tNOTE: For the control, the Null (control) reagent lacks any mammalian genetic elements and can be used to help determine potential baculovirus-mediated effects and background fluorescence. A non-targeted GFP transduction control may also be used, which will light up the entire cell.\nReplace the culture medium with fresh medium. Add 2 mL of the new medium and 40 µL of GFP-tagged α-tubulin to each well.\nShake the plate gently to allow complete mixing of GFP-tagged α-tubulin with the culture medium. Return the plate to the culture incubator and incubate for 24 h to allow the expression of GFP-tubulin.\nTreat cells with docetaxel\n\tNOTE: This experiment is to test the effect of docetaxel on microtubule dynamic instability. Thus, the cells are treated with the desired concentration of docetaxel.",
    "Prepare a medium composed 90% of DMEM and 10% of FBS and supplemented with non-essential amino acids. Use DMEM without phenol red because phenol red may interfere with the fluorescence of GFP-tubulin. Add the desired concentration of docetaxel (ranging from 10 nM to 10 µM). The stock solution of docetaxel is 10 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).\nPre-warm the docetaxel-containing medium to 37 °C in the tissue culture incubator.\nReplace the normal culture medium with the docetaxel-containing medium and incubate for 30 min in the tissue culture incubator. There should be at least 3 coverslips per well for each docetaxel concentration.\n2. Live Imaging to Examine Microtubule Dynamic Instability\nSetting up the system\nPerform experiments in a chamber maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Acquire fluorescence images by time lapse with a microscopic system equipped with a 60X, 1.42 NA oil objective lens on an inverted fluorescence microscope and with a CCD camera.\nSet up the cells for live imaging. Pre-warm both the sample holder and the medium to 37 °C. Choose a coverslip to examine. Mount the coverslip of interest on a sample holder and incubate it with 1 mL of the docetaxel-containing medium prepared in step 1.3.1.\nLive imaging of microtubule dynamic instability\nIdentify the cells that will be used for imaging. They should be flat, have a high fluorescence intensity of expressed GFP-tubulin, and have clear microtubule structures.\nChoose one cell from the group of identified cells from step 2.2.1 to examine first. Focus on the peripheral area of the identified cell. Set up the program for exposure time and the frequency of image acquisition. As exposure time is usually 0.5 s, the images will be acquired every two s.",
    "Allow an additional 20 min for the steps from 1.33 to 2.2.3. Thus,exactly 50 min after the addition of docetaxel, as described in step 1.3.3, start imaging (this is for standardization).\nRecord the microtubule dynamics for 2 min, taking a photo every 2 s. In total, acquire 60 images for the identified cell.\nMove to the next identified cell and repeat steps 2.2.2 to 2.2.4. Repeat the procedure until 5 cells have been imaged. It is imperative to do this before the time reaches 70 min after the addition of docetaxel, as described in step 1.3.3.\nFor each treatment condition, repeat steps 2.2.1 to 2.2.5 for 3 different coverslips. In total, image 15 cells, which is enough data to measure microtubule dynamic instability.\n3. Image Processing and Data Analysis\nDeconvolution of images\nDeconvolve the acquired images to achieve a high quality. Open the deconvolution program equipped with the microscope system.\nClick \"Process\" and select \"Deconvolve.\" Drag the image file to the \"Input\" window and click \"Do.\" The image file will be deconvolved, and the deconvolved file will be saved as a new file automatically.\nGeneration of videos\nClick the deconvolved image file to open with equipped software.\nClick \"File\" and select \"Save as movie.\" Select the \"Movie format\" as \"AV\" and the \"Animation style\" as \"Forward.\" Set the \"Compression quality\" to \"100%\" and the \"Frame rate\" to \"5/second.\"\nCheck the box of \"Animate through time\" and click \"Do it.\" The video will be generated.\nMeasurement of microtubule shortening and growth rate\nIdentify the microtubules that will be used for measurement. For each cell, only a few microtubules will be able to have their shortening or growth followed clearly and completely.",
    "Examine each frame of the video to identify the frame that shows the starting length of the microtubule and the frame with the most extended or shortened microtubule. Measure the change in length between the two microtubules and the time elapsed between the two frames.\nCalculate the rate of growth or shortening by dividing the change in length by time (the unit is µm/s). For each treatment condition, follow at least 10 cells and measure at least 20 microtubules.\nCalculate the average and the standard error for each treatment condition. Analyze the statistical difference between the conditions using the Student test. Report the data in a table and/or in a chart.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
