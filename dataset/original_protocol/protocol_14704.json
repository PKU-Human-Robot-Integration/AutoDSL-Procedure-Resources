    "1. Generation of Spheroids\nPrepare single-cell suspension for hanging drop cultures by detaching adherent cancer cell cultures of ~70% confluence using a PBS wash followed by exposure to 0.05% trypsin-EDTA solution.\n\t\nNeutralize the trypsin solution with cell culture media and count the cells using an aliquot of the cell suspension. Note: The specific cell culture media will depend on the cell line being tested. Follow ATCC media recommendations, where the cell culture media is typically DMEM + 10% FBS. More information can be found in the Materials Table.\nPerform a dilution to allow for the seeding of 500-1,000 cells per 20 µl drop of cell culture media.\nAcquire 10 cm dish and add 5 ml of sterile PBS to the bottom. Note: This step protects the hanging drops from evaporation. Lower-cost “bacteriological grade” dishes can be used in place of cell culture grade dishes, as cells will not contact the culture surface.\nUse a multi-channel pipet to transfer 20 µl droplets of the diluted cell suspension to the inner surface of the lid.\n\t\nPipet 40 drops (5 rows of 8 drops) onto the lid of the 10 cm dish.\nInvert the lid and place over the culture dish. Incubate the hanging drop cultures at 37 °C for 72 hr to generate spheroids.\n\t\nFlip the lid in a confident, yet controlled manner. Note: Inverting the lid too fast or too slow may cause the droplets to shift. Some cell lines may form spheroids in 48 hr or less, while others may require more than 72 hr to produce compact aggregates.\n2. Embedding of Spheroids into 3D Matrix\nThaw an aliquot of growth factor-reduced basement membrane materials at 4 °C overnight before embedding the spheroids.\n\t\nOptional: Layer wells with ECM in advance to prevent potential spheroid interaction with the tissue culture surface.",
    "Pipet 200 µl of ECM per well on a 24-well plate.\nTilt the plate to ensure that the ECM covers the entire well surface.\nCarefully remove excess ECM with a pipet.\nIncubate the plate until the wells are dry: 3 hr at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C.\nCollect the spheroids by tilting the lid of the tissue culture dish and pooling the media. Transfer the media with the spheroids into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.\nAllow 10 min for the spheroids to settle at the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube. Spheroids should be visible by eye.\nMix 100 µl of the basement membrane materials with 100 µl of cold (4 °C) type I collagen in a separate pre-chilled tube. Keep the mixture at 4 °C to prevent either gel from solidifying prematurely.\n\t\nUse pre-chilled pipet tips if transferring small volumes.\nGive care when mixing the basement membrane materials and collagen type I to prevent air bubble formation. Note: Air bubbles may hinder imaging later in the protocol if they become embedded in the gel.\nAspirate the spheroids from the 40 µl bottom portion of the microcentrifuge tube, and combine with the basement membrane materials/type I collagen mixture. Be careful to prevent air bubble formation when mixing. Note: The solution containing of 100 µl basement membrane materials, 100 µl collagen type I, and 40 µl of the spheroids will create enough material for 4 independent 3D cultures. This can be scaled up or down.\nPipet 40 µl drops of the viscous mixture into the centers of wells on a 24-well plate. Keep the plate level to prevent the mixture from running into the side of the well. Note: A single column on the 24-well plate – 4 wells – is recommended for each condition to be tested.",
    "Place the plate into a 37 °C incubator and leave undisturbed for 30 min. The 3D culture will polymerize during this period.\nSlowly submerge the 3D cultures in 1 ml of cell culture media.\n\t\nEnsure that the media is warm when adding it into the wells to further promote gel polymerization.\nCRITICAL STEP: Gently add the media to the 3D cultures. Pipetting the media too quickly into the wells can lead to detachment of the 3D cultures from the tissue culture surface.\n3. Monitoring and Analyzing Spheroid Invasion\nImage invasion from the spheroids into the surrounding 3D matrix at time-points decided by the investigator. Acquire photographs using an inverted microscope with the 20x objective lens. Note: Ideal time-points will differ depending on the cell line being tested. More invasive cell lines will begin their egress from the spheroids shortly after plating and, therefore, take initial photographs within a couple of hours after plating. Generally, photographs are taken at 0 hr (after plating), 24 hr, and 48 hr. Invasion typically concludes 24 to 48 hr after plating.\nQuantitate invasive ability using image analysis software like Image J.\n\t\nAnalyze invasion as the cell distance from the edge of the spheroid.\n\t\t\nUse the Straight Draw Tool to mark the radius and/or maximal invasive distance.\nClick “Analyze” in the top menu, and then click “Measure” to display the length measurement.\nAnalyze invasion as the total invasive area outside the spheroid.\n\t\t\nUse the Freehand Draw Tool to trace the border of the spheroid and/or total invasive area.\nClick “Analyze” in the top menu, and then click “Measure” to display the area measurement.\nUse a plugin like ROI Manager Tools to create measurements for a stack of images.\nSubscription Required.
