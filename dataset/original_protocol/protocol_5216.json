    "Cell lysate preparationHarvest 1-5 x 106 cells by centrifugation (300 x g, 5 min, 4 °C).Note: IRF5 phosphorylation occurs in specific cell types and conditions. For example: Bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) stimulated with CpG-B oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) (Ban et al., 2016). BMDCs are obtained by culturing mouse bone marrow cells with 100 ng/ml of the Flt3 ligand. After 9 days of culture, BMDCs are collected and seeded at 5 x 106 cells/well in a 6-well culture plate. They are then stimulated with 0.15 μM CpG-B ODN for 3 or 6 h (Figure 2). Other examples of appropriate cell models include HEK293T cells transfected with IRF5 and MyD88 (Ban et al., 2016) or IRF5 and IKKβ (Lopez-Pelaez et al., 2014; Ren et al., 2014), THP-1 cells stimulated with a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Ren et al., 2014), and Gen2.2 cells stimulated with CL097 (Lopez-Pelaez et al., 2014).Remove the supernatant, tap the tube to loosen the cell pellet, add 5 ml of ice-cold PBS, and mix the cells by inverting the tube five times.Repellet the cells by centrifugation.Remove the supernatant, quickly centrifuge the sample, and carefully remove all residual supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet.Add 50 μl of ice-cold EDTA-free lysis buffer to the cell pellet and then vigorously pipette up and down 20 times.Note: EDTA may prevent the binding of the Phos-tag to the target protein phosphate groups by chelating metal ions; thus, the lysis buffer should be EDTA-free. (Optional) For phosphatase treatment to validate detected phosphorylation, 1% NP-40 TBS buffer is used instead of EDTA-free lysis buffer.Place the tube on ice for 30 min.Centrifuge the sample at 15,000 x g, for 15 min at 4 °C and then transfer the supernatant (cell lysate) to a clean microcentrifuge tube on ice without transferring the cellular debris at the bottom.",
    "Note: The cell lysate can be stored at -80 °C.SDS-PAGE(Optional) If you prepare handmade Phos-tag acrylamide gels rather than using the precast gels, see Recipes.Quantify the protein concentration of the cell lysate. For the Bio-Rad Protein Assay, dilute the cell lysate by 20-fold with distilled water, add 5 μl of diluted cell lysate to 245 μl of 1x Bio-Rad Protein Assay, mix well by vortexing, and measure absorbance at 595 nm. Use a dilution series of bovine serum albumin (BSA) aqueous solution to construct a standard curve.In a clean microcentrifuge tube, prepare 1-3 μg/μl cell lysate (10-30 μg/10 μl/well) by diluting with EDTA-free lysis buffer, and add 6x sample buffer (2 μl/well).(Optional) For phosphatase treatment, 10 μg of the cell lysate prepared by using 1% NP-40 TBS buffer is incubated with the reaction mixture containing 1x NEBuffer for PMP (supplied with λPPase), 1 mM MnCl2, and 400 U of λPPase for 60 min at 30 °C. It is then further incubated with 30 U of CIAP for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction is stopped by addition of 6x sample buffer.Heat the samples at 100 °C for 5 min and then cool the samples to room temperature (20-24 °C).Set up the handmade or precast gel in a gel tank by following the manufacturer instructions, and attach the leads to the power supply. Use running buffer in both the upper and lower chamber buffers.Note: Tris-glycine running buffer can be used for both the handmade gel (containing Mn2+), and the precast gel (containing Zn2+), while Tris-MOPS running buffer can be used only for the precast gel. Both precast and handmade gels were successfully employed to detect IRF5 phosphorylation in the Tris-glycine running buffer.",
    "For other proteins, it will be necessary to empirically determine which combination of gel (metal ion) and running buffer is optimal for phosphorylation detection.Apply the samples into the wells (12 μl/well) and run the gels as follows:Handmade: Constant-voltage condition of 80 V for approximately 40 min (until bromophenol blue [BPB] dye reaches the separating gel), and then at 120 V for 200 min at room temperaturePrecast: Constant-current condition of 15 mA/gel for 30 min, and then 30 mA/gel for 100 min at room temperatureNote: The above are optimized conditions for the separation of phosphorylated IRF5, where the position of the BPB dye and running time are used as a guide for electrophoresis. For other proteins, first run the gels until the BPB dye reaches the bottom of the separating gel, and increase the running time if better separation is required. The WIDE VIEW prestained protein size marker III (WAKO) can be used to evaluate the transfer efficiency, although notably, it does not identify the actual molecular weight of proteins. To avoid band distortion in the adjacent lanes, at least one blank lane should be left between this marker and the analyzed samples. Transfer and blockingDuring the run, prepare blocking solution (see Recipes) and immerse the filter papers in transfer buffer.When the run is complete, remove the gels from the apparatus and cut off the stacking gel.Incubate the gels in EDTA-containing transfer buffer (25 ml/gel) for 10 min with gentle shaking (60 rpm) at room temperature. Discard the buffer.Note: Since metal ions in the gel interfere with the transfer, EDTA-containing transfer buffer is used to remove them from the gel after SDS-PAGE.Repeat the incubation twice (three times in total).Incubate the gels once in EDTA-free transfer buffer (25 ml/gel) for 10 min with gentle shaking at room temperature.",
    "Note: Since EDTA in the transfer buffer also interferes with the transfer, EDTA-free transfer buffer is used to remove EDTA from the gel after removal of the metal ions.Briefly pre-wet the PVDF membrane in methanol until the membrane is completely wet, discard methanol, add transfer buffer, and incubate for at least 10 min with gentle shaking (60 rpm) at room temperature.Stack 5 filter papers, the PVDF membrane, gel, and 5 filter papers in this order from the anode (+) to the cathode (-) of the semi-dry blotter. Gently remove any air bubbles with the blotting roller.Run at 100 mA/gel (2 mA of current per cm2 of gel) for 60 min at room temperature.When the run is complete, remove the membrane from the stack and incubate the membrane in blocking solution for 30 min with gentle shaking at room temperature.Antigen-antibody reaction and ECL detectionPrepare primary antibody solution (anti-IRF5 antibody diluted by 3,000-fold with MaxBlot solution 1).Note: Using the blocking solution (5% skim milk in TBS-T) to dilute the anti-IRF5 antibody (Abcam) causes the appearance of non-specific bands. For other antibodies, the blocking solution can be used to dilute the primary antibody during Phos-tag immunoblot analysis if it is known to facilitate the appearance of a correct specific (preferably single) band via the standard immunoblot analysis method.Rinse the membrane with TBS-T and incubate it in primary antibody solution for 90 min at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking.Wash the membrane 5 times with TBS-T (5 min incubation for each washing).Prepare secondary antibody solution (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody diluted by 20,000-fold with blocking solution).Incubate the membrane in secondary antibody solution for 60 min at room temperature with gentle shaking.Wash the membrane 5 times with TBS-T (5 min incubation for each washing).",
