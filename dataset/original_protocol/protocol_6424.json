    "Raising seedlings for experimentsSow one cucumber seed (Cucumis sativus ‘Aramon’, Rijk Zwaan, De Lier, The Netherlands) in each rock-wool cube (3.6 cm × 3.6 cm × 4 cm, Figures 1A and 1B) and water sufficiently until the cubes are completely wet.Sow 20-40% more seeds (lower the germination rate and quality, more the additional amount) than the number of plants required for the experimental design in order to select for uniform seedlings in 7-10 days.Set environmental conditions to 10-15 mol m-2 d-1 photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) at the seedling level with 12 h light period, 24 °C day/20 °C night air temperature and 70% relative humidity.Eight days after sowing, transfer each rockwool cube into a larger rockwool cube (10 cm × 10 cm × 6.5 cm, Figure1C) and irrigate with nutrient solution of N-P-K fertilizer (0.5 g L-1 Ferty 2 MEGA; Planta, Regenstauf, Germany; 5.7 mM N, 2.7 mM K, 0.35 mM P, 0.45 mM Mg in working solution) once every day.Growth chamber experiment to parameterize the protein turnover modelTransplanting and starting experimentPrepare chambers with at least three constant light intensities (one < 5, one between 10-15 and one > 25 mol photon m-2 d-1 PAR for cucumber) at the plant level, which should cover most variation found in the light environment during crop production.Prepare nutrient solution with at least three levels of nitrogen (one < 2.8, one 3.5-5 and one > 8.5 mM NO3- for cucumber Aramon) using N fertilizer (YaraLiva Calcinit; Yara, Oslo, Norway) and P-K fertilizer (Ferty Basisdünger 1; Planta, Regenstauf, Germany; 5.2 mM K, 1.3 mM P, 0.82 mM Mg in working solution) if the effect of nitrogen is of interest.Transplant the seedlings when their second true leaves reach a length of 3 cm (ca.",
    "eight days grown in the larger rockwool cubes) into hydroponic system (Figure 1D), consisting of a 25-L plastic box and a piece of polystyrene foam board that fixes a rockwool cube containing a plant.Fill 25-L boxes with nutrient solution and supply the solution with air from aeration system (Figure 1E).Prepare polystyrene foam boards for supporting the plants in the hydroponic system.Cut polystyrene foam boards to make them fit onto 25-L boxes.Cut a squared opening (9.5 cm × 9.5 cm) in the middle of the boards.Fix the plants into the openings in polystyrene foam boards and position them into the 25-L boxes.Select the healthy and unshaded leaves within leaf ranks four to eight (counted acropetally) as sampled leaves in each plant and record their dates of appearance.Record light condition at the level of the sampled leaves using quantum sensor LI-190R and light meter LI-250A (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA).Plant care and monitoring environmental conditionsPrepare custom-made leaf holders.Make leaf holders using plastic coated metal wires to form a loop structure, consisting of a circular part which supports the leaf and a stick part which can be fixed to the stem and petiole (Figure 1F).Combine each holder with two plastic plant support clips at the stick part.Prepare leaf holders in different sizes and lengths in order to support leaves at various developmental stages.Allow plants to establish vegetative growth by removing flowers below the seventh node.Keep plants to single stem by cutting all side shoots and train the rest of the shoot above the sampled leaves downward to avoid mutual shading (Figure 1G).Renew the nutrient solution completely and record the nitrogen level in the nutrient solution once a week, fill the solution once between two times of solution renewal, and adjust pH value to 6.0-6.5 by 1% H2SO4 twice a week.",
    "Place data loggers Tinytag (Gemini Data Loggers, Chichester, UK) around the sampled leaves and record daily mean air temperature (Tmean, °C).Measure and record the PAR at the center of the sampled leaves (Figure 1a in Wiechers et al., 2011) weekly and adjust the angle of the leaves using leaf holders (Figure 1F) to make sure they are horizontally and fully exposed to the light, not shaded by other leaves, in order to achieve target PAR level at the leaves.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200313/20200313184251_8647.jpgFigure 1.

Avoiding shading of the sampled leaf (marked yellow) by training rest of the shoot downward.Collecting data of the sampled leavesGas exchangeConduct measurements for each environmental condition at an interval of three to four days, starting with the youngest leaves (ca. three days after leaf appearance) and then the older ones to obtain data from leaves with a wide range of ages (ca. 40-550 °Cd).Estimate age (t, °Cd) of individual leaves days from the day of its appearance to the day of measurement using daily mean temperature and a base temperature (Tbase, 10 °C for cucumber):imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200313/20200313184344_2974.pngMeasure net photosynthesis rate (An, μmol CO2 m-2 s-1, Table 1), intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci, µmol mol-1), photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD, µmol m-2 s-1) and quantum efficiency of photosystem II electron transport (ϕPSII) using a portable photosynthesis system LI-6400XT or LI-6800 (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA).Table 1.

Freeze dry lamina samples for 48 h under pressure of 1.030 mbar and then measure the mass of freeze-dried lamina. Please note that most samples can be dried to 1-5% residual moisture; therefore, the measured dry mass should be corrected to exclude the weight of residual moisture.Grind the lamina into fine powder and analyze total nitrogen (e.g., Nelson and Sommers, 1980) and chlorophyll (e.g., Lichtenthaler, 1987) content.Collect data to a .csv  filefile (Figure 3 and Table 3; in this example ‘example_chamber_harvest_data.csv’), which will be used in data analysis sections A and B for data processing.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200313/20200313184635_4506.jpgFigure 3.
