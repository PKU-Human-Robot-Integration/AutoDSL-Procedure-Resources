  "procedures": [
    "All procedures were performed according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised in 1996) and were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University (Guangzhou, China). Healthy male C57BL/6J mice (8-10 weeks old; body weight, 25-30 g) were obtained from the Animal Center of Southern Medical University. Female mice can also be used, but mixing both genders is not recommended due to the potential influences of sex differences. After arrival, the mice were housed under a 12-h/12-h dark/light cycle (3-4 mice per cage), with ad libitum food and water.\n1. Preparation for surgery\nSterilize surgical instruments by autoclaving before the surgery. Adjust the heating pad to 37 °C.\nAnesthetize the mice by an intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg of pentobarbital (see Table of Materials) to relieve surgical pain. Place the mice in separate boxes for anesthesia induction. Ensure the depth of anesthesia by the absence of a toe-withdrawal response.\n\tNOTE: It is also recommended to use 1.5% isoflurane for inhalation anesthesia because it is better for analgesia.\nPlace the mice supine on the pad by fixing their incisors with a suture and immobilizing their limbs with adhesive tape. Ensure the depth of anesthesia again by checking the reflex.\nRemove hair from the neck to xiphoid with a depilatory cream. Disinfect the surgical area 3 times with alternating antiseptic scrub and 75% alcohol and then drape the surgical field.\nPerform intubation following the steps below.\n\t\nAdjust the breathing frequency of the animal with a mini ventilator (see Table of Materials) to 150/min and the tidal volume to 300 µL.\n\t\t​NOTE: It is unnecessary to use positive end-expiratory pressure mode.",
    "Pull out the tongue slightly with tweezers, lift the mandible with a tongue depressor to expose the glottis, and perform intra-tracheal intubation by inserting a 22 G cannula into the glottis.\nSwitch on the mini ventilator and connect the tracheal cannula to the ventilator. The phenomenon of thoracic undulation becoming equal to the ventilator frequency indicates successful intubation. Fix the cannula with tape to prevent slipping during the operation.\n2. Permanent ligation of the right coronary artery\nConnect the electrocardiography (ECG) electrodes (see Table of Materials) to the mouse limbs correctly and record the ECG.\n\tNOTE: One of the II, III, or AVF lead is selected as a monitoring lead; Lead III is more appropriate.\nOpen the chest.\n\t\nMake a 1 cm long incision in the skin parallel to the third right rib with ophthalmic scissors. Determine the third intercostal again and ensure adequate space according to the sternum angle.\n\t\tNOTE: The direction of the skin incision is made from the sternum angle to the right anterior axillary line.\nSeparate and cut the pectoralis major and pectoralis minor muscles with scissors and micro forceps above the third intercostal space. After that, bluntly separate the intercostal muscle with elbow forceps to expose the surgical field.\n\t\tNOTE: Only a small part of pectoral muscles needs to be cut, and then a blunt separation is recommended to expose the heart.\nIncise the pericardium. Lift the right atrium with sterile cotton and ligate the RCA with a sterile 8-0 nylon thread with a ligation range of 3-5 mm. After ligating the RCA, the monitoring ECG (lead III) shows ST-segment elevation.",
    "NOTE: Because the mouse RCA is invisible, its anatomic location must be carefully confirmed. The myocardium of the RV is much thinner than that of the LV. Therefore, it is difficult to grasp the depth of the inserted needle. It is easy to induce sinus bradycardia and atrioventricular block if the depth of the inserted needle is too deep and the ligation range is too large.\nRemove the sterile cotton and suture muscles and skin with a sterile 5-0 nylon thread to close the intercostal incision. Disinfect the skin again with 75% alcohol and single-house the mouse after surgery.\n\tNOTE: The well-sutured muscle is important for avoiding aerothorax. A sterile drainage tube is placed in the chest cavity until the completion of chest closing, and then the chest cavity is evacuated by an injection syringe connecting the drainage tube.\n\tNOTE: After surgery, mice are placed on a heating pad. Analgesics such as buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg body weight, subcutaneously injection) are required to reduce the animals' pain after the surgery. The expected complications are sinus bradycardia and atrioventricular block, and the mortality rate post-surgery is 10-20%.\n3. Echocardiographic assessment of the RV function after surgery\nNOTE: For echocardiography, use an MS400D probe with a center frequency of 30 MHz, connected to a high-resolution ultrasound imaging system (see Table of Materials). The echocardiography examination is performed 4 weeks after surgery.\nAnesthetize the mouse with 3% isoflurane via inhalation.\nPlace the mouse in the supine position on an ultrasonic platform for animal fixation and ultrasonic operation. Tape its claws to the electrode to obtain an ECG recording through a system attached to the ultrasonic machine.\nMonitor heart rate through ECG and maintain it between 450-550 beats/min by adjusting the anesthetic concentration between 1.5% and 3%.",
    "Remove the hair from the mouse's chest with a depilatory cream and apply ultrasound gel to the skin of the chest.\nSet the platform to the horizontal position. Orient the transducer parallel to the left leg and obtain the left ventricular long-axis image. Rotate the probe 90° clockwise to obtain the LV short-axis view. Press the Cine store button to save the images.\n\tNOTE: The upper-left of the platform is tilted at the lowest point. The LV short-axis rotation angle of the transducer is maintained while the transducer is oriented toward the right shoulder of the mouse.\nMove down the transducer vertically, maintaining its position over the upper abdomen and below the mouse's diaphragm under B-mode. Adjust the platform position slightly by rotating its x- and y-axes until the RV, right atrium (RA), left atrium (LA), and LV are clearly seen on the screen. Save apical four-chamber images by pressing the Cine store or Frame store button.\n\tNOTE: B-mode is used to show the two-dimension (2D) view of the heart.\nPress M-mode; after the 2x indicator line appears, locate the indicator line at the tricuspid valve orifice to obtain the movement of the tricuspid annular plane. Press the Cine store or Frame store button to save data and images.\n\tNOTE: M-mode means motion mode, which reveals the motion of the heart or vessel in a curve form.\nPress Measure button to enter measurement mode. Click on Area measurement button to zone into RV and LV. Calculate the area of RV and LV to obtain the area ratio of RV to LV.",
    "Click on Timeline button and make two baselines to define the movement range of the tricuspid annular plane during the systolic and diastolic periods. Click on Distance button and measure the distance between two baselines to obtain tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE).\nTilt the left side of the platform at the lowest point. Keep the probe at a 30° angle to the horizontal axis along the right anterior axillary line. Rotate the x- and y-axes of the platform to display the RV.\n\t\nPress M-mode button and locate the indicator line at the septum's hyperechoic point to obtain the M-mode image of the RV interface. Press Cine store button to save the picture.\nOpen the M-mode image of the RV interface, press Measure button to enter measurement mode. Measure the RV inner distance at the end of diastole (RVIDd), RV ejection fraction (RVEF), and RV fraction shortening (RVFS) using the in-built measurement tool of the echocardiographic system.\nStop administering isoflurane and place the mouse on the heating pad for 3-5 min until it regains consciousness. After that, return the mouse to its cage with 12 h light/dark cycle.\n4. Invasive measurements of RV hemodynamic\nNOTE: RV hemodynamic is assessed through right heart catheterization 4 weeks after RVI. A 1.0 F catheter together with a monitoring system is applied.\nAnesthetize the mouse with an intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg of sodium pentobarbital (see Table of Materials).\nAfter confirming the disappearance of the pedal withdrawal reflex, keep the mouse in the supine position and immobilize it with adhesive tape.\nShave the chest hair from the sternal angle to the xiphoid. Disinfect the operating area with 75% alcohol.\nPerform tracheal intubation and set the parameter of the animal ventilator as described in steps 1.5.2-1.5.3.",
    "Make a 1 cm bilateral incision on the skin above the xiphoid process and transect the diaphragm and rib with ophthalmic scissors to expose the heart.\nPuncture the right ventricular free wall with a 32 G needle. Remove the needle and press the wound with cotton to stanch bleeding.\nInsert the tip of the catheter into the right ventricle through the puncture site and push the catheter forward slowly. Adjust the position of the tip to obtain a typical RV pressure waveform shown on a monitor and recording system.\n\tNOTE: Right jugular vein is also an appropriate route for hemodynamic measurement.\nAfter 10 min of stabilization, record the data of RV systolic blood pressure (RVSBP), RV end-diastolic pressure (RVEDP), and RV dP/dt. Click on Select button to select cardiac cycles for calculation and then click on Analyze button to calculate the mean values of the selected cycles.\nRemove the catheter after completion of recording and then place it inside normal saline solution.\nEuthanize the mouse with an intraperitoneal injection of overdose pentobarbital sodium (150 mg/kg) and then sacrifice it by cervical dislocation.\nCollect the heart and tibia for histological analysis.\n5. Coronary vascular cast using a vascular casting agent\nHeparinize the mouse with an intraperitoneal injection of 200 IU/mL of heparin sodium at 2000 IU/kg (see Table of Materials).\nAnesthetize the mouse with an intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg of sodium pentobarbital.\nPlace the animal supine on the pad and intubate for artificial ventilation following steps 1.5.2-1.5.3.\nOpen the chest with surgical scissors as described in step 4.5 and expose the heart.\nMake a 3 mm notch with ophthalmic scissors on the right atria and perfuse the heart with 5 mL of normal saline through the cardiac apex with an injector.",
    "Block the blood from the aorta with an aortic clamp and perfuse 0.1 mL of nitroglycerin (1 mg/mL) through the cardiac apex with an injector to dilate the coronary artery.\nPrepare the cast reagent by mixing the ingredients in the kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: It is recommended to prepare the cast reagent and perfusion with normal saline and nitroglycerin simultaneously to prevent microvascular closure.\nPerfuse the heart with 1 mL of cast reagent through the cardiac apex and wait for 2-3 h.\nErode the heart with 50% sodium hydroxide for 2-3 days and remove the muscle tissue or connective tissue by rinsing with normal saline.\nTake pictures under a camera.\n\tCAUTION: The cast reagent is harmful to the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract. Sodium hydroxide is corrosive. Wearing protective gloves, goggles, and a lab coat is required. The cast reagent must be prepared in a fume hood.\nSubscription Required.
